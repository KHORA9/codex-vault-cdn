There is little fear that the student who may wish in the\r\nfuture to become master of any subject will have to delve into the\r\noriginal sources in his search after facts and dates.\r\n\r\nSurely pirates, taking them in their broadest sense, are as much entitled\r\nto a biographical dictionary of their own as are clergymen, race-horses,\r\nor artists in ferro-concrete, who all, I am assured, have their own \"Who's\r\nWho\"? Have not the medical men their Directory, the lawyers their List,\r\nthe peers their Peerage? There are books which record the names and the\r\nparticulars of musicians, schoolmasters, stockbrokers, saints and\r\nbookmakers, and I dare say there is an average adjuster's almanac. A peer,\r\na horse, dog, cat, and even a white mouse, if of blood sufficiently blue,\r\nhas his pedigree recorded somewhere. Above all, there is that astounding\r\nand entertaining volume, \"Who's Who,\" found in every club smoking-room,\r\nand which grows more bulky year by year, stuffed with information about\r\nthe careers, the hobbies, and the marriages of all the most distinguished\r\npersons in every profession, including very full details about the lives\r\nand doings of all our journalists. But on the club table where these books\r\nof ready reference stand with \"Whitaker,\" \"ABC,\" and \"Ruff's Guide to the\r\nTurf,\" there is just one gap that the compiler of this work has for a long\r\nwhile felt sorely needed filling. There has been until now no work that\r\ngives immediate and trustworthy information about the lives, and--so sadly\r\nimportant in their cases--the deaths of our pirates and buccaneers.\r\n\r\nIn delving in the volumes of the \"Dictionary of National Biography,\" it\r\nhas been a sad disappointment to the writer to find so little space\r\ndevoted to the careers of these picturesque if, I must admit, often\r\nunseemly persons. There are, of course, to be found a few pirates with\r\nhousehold names such as Kidd, Teach, and Avery. A few, too, of the\r\nbuccaneers, headed by the great Sir Henry Morgan, come in for their share.\r\nBut I compare with indignation the meagre show of pirates in that\r\nmonumental work with the rich profusion of divines! Even during the years\r\nwhen piracy was at its height--say from 1680 until 1730--the pirates are\r\nutterly swamped by the theologians. Can it be that these two professions\r\nflourished most vigorously side by side, and that when one began to\r\nlanguish, the other also began to fade?\r\n\r\nEven so there can be no excuse for the past and present neglect of these\r\nsea-adventurers. But a change is beginning to show itself. Increasing\r\nevidence is to be found that the more intelligent portions of the\r\npopulation of this country, and even more so the enlightened of the great\r\nUnited States of America, are beginning to show a proper interest in the\r\nlives of the pirates and buccaneers. That this should be so amongst the\r\nAmericans is quite natural, when it is remembered what a close intimacy\r\nexisted between their Puritan forefathers of New England and the pirates,\r\nboth by blood relation and by trade, since the pirates had no more\r\nobliging and ready customers for their spoils of gold dust, stolen slaves,\r\nor church ornaments, than the early settlers of New York, Massachusetts,\r\nand Carolina.\r\n\r\nIn beginning to compile such a list as is to be found in this volume, a\r\ndifficulty is met at once. My original intention was that only pirates and\r\nbuccaneers should be included. To admit privateers, corsairs, and other\r\nsea-rovers would have meant the addition of a vast number of names, and\r\nwould have made the work unwieldy, and the very object of this volume as a\r\nbook of ready reference would not have been achieved. But the difficulty\r\nhas been to define the exact meaning of a pirate and of a buccaneer. In\r\nthe dictionary a pirate is defined as \"a sea-robber, marauder, one who\r\ninfringes another's copyright\"; while a buccaneer is described as \"a\r\nsea-robber, a pirate, especially of the Spanish-American coasts.\" This\r\nseems explicit, but a pirate was not a pirate from the cradle to the\r\ngallows. He usually began his life at sea as an honest mariner in the\r\nmerchant service. He perhaps mutinied with other of the ship's crew,\r\nkilled or otherwise disposed of the captain, seized the ship, elected a\r\nnew commander, and sailed off \"on the account.\" Many an honest seaman was\r\ncaptured with the rest of his ship's crew by a pirate, and either\r\nvoluntarily joined the freebooters by signing their articles, or, being a\r\ngood navigator or \"sea-artist,\" was compelled by the pirates to lend them\r\nhis services. Others, again, were in privateer ships, which carried on a\r\nlegitimate warfare against the shipping of hostile countries, under a\r\ncommission or letter of marque.\r\n\r\nOften the very commission or letter of marque carried about so jealously\r\nby some shady privateer was not worth the paper it was written on, nor the\r\nhandful of dubloons paid for it. One buccaneer sailed about the South\r\nSeas, plundering Spanish ships and sacking churches and burning towns,\r\nunder a commission issued to him, for a consideration, by the Governor of\r\na Danish West India island, himself an ex-pirate. This precious document,\r\nadorned with florid scrolls and a big, impressive seal, was written in\r\nDanish. Someone with a knowledge of that language had an opportunity and\r\nthe curiosity to translate it, when he found that all it entitled the\r\nbearer to do was to hunt for goats and pigs on the Island of Hispaniola,\r\nand nothing more.\r\n\r\nWhen, at the conclusion of hostilities, peace was declared, the crew of a\r\nprivateer found it exceedingly irksome to give up the roving life, and\r\nwere liable to drift into piracy. Often it happened that, after a long\r\nnaval war, crews were disbanded, ships laid up, and navies reduced, thus\r\nflooding the countryside with idle mariners, and filling the roads with\r\nbegging and starving seamen. These were driven to go to sea if they could\r\nfind a berth, often half starved and brutally treated, and always\r\nunderpaid, and so easily yielded to the temptation of joining some vessel\r\nbound vaguely for the \"South Sea,\" where no questions were asked and no\r\nwages paid, but every hand on board had a share in the adventure.\r\n\r\nThe buccaneers were a great source of piracy also. When a war was on hand\r\nthe English Government was only too glad to have the help of these daring\r\nand skilful seamen; but when peace was declared these allies began to lead\r\nto international complications, and means had to be taken to abolish them,\r\nand to try and turn them into honest settlers in the islands. But when a\r\nman has for years lived the free life, sailed out from Jamaica a pauper,\r\nto return in six weeks or less with, perhaps, a bag of gold worth two,\r\nthree, or four thousand pounds, which he has prided himself on spending in\r\nthe taverns and gambling-hells of Port Royal in a week, how can he settle\r\ndown to humdrum uneventful toil, with its small profits? Thus he goes back\r\n\"on the account\" and sails to some prearranged rendezvous of the \"brethren\r\nof the coast.\"\r\n\r\nTo write a whole history of piracy would be a great undertaking, but a\r\nvery interesting one. Piracy must have begun in the far, dim ages, and\r\nperhaps when some naked savage, paddling himself across a tropical river,\r\nmet with another adventurer on a better tree-trunk, or carrying a bigger\r\nbunch of bananas, the first act of piracy was committed. Indeed, piracy\r\nmust surely be the third oldest profession in the world, if we give the\r\nhonour of the second place to the ancient craft of healing. If such a\r\nhistory were to include the whole of piracy, it would have to refer to the\r\nPhoenicians, to the Mediterranean sea-rovers of the days of Rome, who, had\r\nthey but known it, held the future destiny of the world in their grasp\r\nwhen they, a handful of pirates, took prisoner the young Julius Cæsar, to\r\nransom him and afterwards to be caught and crucified by him. The Arabs in\r\nthe Red Sea were for many years past-masters of the art of piracy, as were\r\nthe Barbary corsairs of Algiers and Tunis, who made the Mediterranean a\r\nplace of danger for many generations of seamen. All this while the Chinese\r\nand Malays were active pirates, while the Pirate coast of the Persian Gulf\r\nwas feared by all mariners. Then arose the great period, beginning in the\r\nreign of Henry VIII., advancing with rapid strides during the adventurous\r\nyears of Queen Elizabeth, when many West of England squires were wont to\r\nsell their estates and invest all in a ship in which to go cruising on\r\nthe Spanish Main, in the hope of taking a rich Spanish galleon homeward\r\nbound from Cartagena and Porto Bello, deep laden with the riches of Peru\r\nand Mexico.\r\n\r\nOut of these semi-pirate adventurers developed the buccaneers, a\r\nruffianly, dare-devil lot, who feared neither God, man, nor death.\r\n\r\nBy the middle of the eighteenth century piracy was on the wane, and\r\npractically had died out by the beginning of the nineteenth, the final\r\nthrust that destroyed it being given by the American and English Navies in\r\nthe North Atlantic and West Indian Seas. But by this time piracy had\r\ndegenerated to mere sea-robbing, the days of gallant and ruthless\r\nsea-battles had passed, and the pirate of those decadent days was\r\ngenerally a Spanish-American half-breed, with no courage, a mere robber\r\nand murderer.\r\n\r\nThe advent of the telegraph and of steam-driven ships settled for ever the\r\naccount of the pirates, except in China, when even to this day accounts\r\nreach us, through the Press, of piratical enterprises; but never again\r\nwill the black, rakish-looking craft of the pirate, with the Jolly Roger\r\nflying, be liable to pounce down upon the unsuspecting and harmless\r\nmerchantman.\r\n\r\nThe books devoted to the lives and exploits of buccaneers and pirates are\r\nfew. Indeed, but two stand out prominently, both masterpieces of their\r\nkind. One, \"The Bucaniers of America, or a True Account of the Most\r\nRemarkable Assaults Committed of Late Years upon the Coasts of the West\r\nIndies,\" etc., was written by a sea-surgeon to the buccaneers, A.O.\r\nExquemelin, a Dutchman, and was published at Amsterdam in 1679.\r\n\r\nMany translations were made, the first one in English being published in\r\n1684 by William Crooke, at the Green Dragon, without Temple Bar, in\r\nLondon. The publication of this book was the cause of a libel action\r\nbrought by Sir Henry Morgan against the publisher; the buccaneer commander\r\nwon his case and was granted £200 damages and a public apology. In this\r\nbook Morgan was held up as a perfect monster for his cruel treatment to\r\nhis prisoners, but although Morgan resented this very much, the statement\r\nthat annoyed him much more was that which told the reader that Morgan came\r\nof very humble stock and was sold by his parents when a boy, to serve as a\r\nlabourer in Barbadoes.\r\n\r\nThe greatest work on pirates was written in 1726 by Captain Charles\r\nJohnson. The original edition, now exceedingly rare, is called \"A General\r\nHistory of the Pyrates, from Their First Rise and Settlement in the Island\r\nof Providence, to the Present Time,\" and is illustrated by interesting\r\nengravings.\r\n\r\nAnother edition, in 1734, is a handsome folio called \"A General History of\r\nthe Lives and Adventures of the Most Famous Highwaymen,\" etc., \"To which\r\nis added a Genuine Account of the Voyages and Plunders of the Most\r\nNotorious Pyrates,\" and contains many full-page copperplates by J. Basire\r\nand others. The pirates are given only a share in the pages of this book,\r\nbut it has some very fine engravings of such famous pirates as Avery,\r\nRoberts, Low, Lowther, and \"Blackbeard.\"\r\n\r\nThe third edition of the \"History of Pirates,\" of 1725, has a quaint\r\nfrontispiece, showing the two women pirates, Anne Bonny and Mary Read, in\r\naction with their swords drawn, upon the deck of a ship. While the fourth\r\nedition, published in 1726, in two volumes, contains the stories of the\r\nless well-known South-Sea Rovers.\r\n\r\nAfter studying the subject of piracy at all closely, one cannot but be\r\nstruck by the number of pirates who came from Wales. Welshmen figure not\r\nonly amongst the rank and file, but amongst the leaders. Morgan, of\r\ncourse, stands head and shoulders above the rest. It is curious how\r\ncertain races show particular adaptability for certain callings. Up to two\r\nhundred years ago the chief pirates were Welshmen; to-day most of our\r\nhaberdashers hail from the same land of the leek. It would be interesting\r\nto try and fathom the reason why these two callings, at first sight so\r\ndissimilar, should call forth the qualities in a particular race. Perhaps\r\nsome of our leading haberdashers and linen drapers will be willing to\r\nsupply the answer.\r\n\r\nI sometimes wonder what happens to the modern pirates; I mean the men who,\r\nhad they lived 200 years ago, would have been pirates. What do they find\r\nto exercise their undoubted, if unsocial, talents and energies to-day?\r\nMany, I think, find openings of an adventurous financial kind in the City.\r\n\r\nPolitics, again, surely has its buccaneers. One can imagine, for example,\r\nsome leading modern politician--let us say a Welshman--who, like Morgan,\r\nbeing a brilliant public speaker, is able by his eloquence to sway vast\r\ncrowds of listeners, whether buccaneers or electors, a man of quick and\r\nsubtle mind, able to recognize and seize upon the main chance, perfectly\r\nruthless in his methods when necessity requires, and one who, having\r\nachieved the goal on which he had set his ambition, discards his party or\r\nfollowers, as Morgan did his buccaneers after the sacking of Panama. Nor\r\nis Europe to-day without a counterpart to the ruffian crews who arrogantly\r\n\"defied the world and declared war on all nations.\"\r\n\r\nOne great difficulty which the author of this work is met with is to\r\ndecide who was, and who was not, a pirate.\r\n\r\nCertain friends who have taken a kindly, if somewhat frivolous, interest\r\nin the compilation of this work have inquired if Sir Francis Drake was to\r\nbe included; and it must be admitted that the question is not an easy one\r\nto answer. The most fervent patriot must admit that the early voyages of\r\nDrake were, to put it mildly, of a buccaneering kind, although his late\r\nvoyages were more nearly akin to privateering cruises than piracy. But if,\r\nduring the reign of King Philip, a Spaniard had been asked if Drake was a\r\npirate, he would certainly have answered, \"Yes,\" and that without any\r\nhesitation whatever. So much depends upon the point of view.\r\n\r\nIn the 1814 edition of Johnson's \"History of Highwaymen and Pirates,\" the\r\nfamous Paul Jones holds a prominent place as a pirate, and is described in\r\nno half measures as a traitor; yet I doubt if in the schools of America\r\nto-day the rising young citizens of \"God's Own Country\" are told any such\r\nthing, but are probably, and quite naturally, taught to look upon Paul\r\nJones as a true patriot and a brave sailor. Again, there is Christopher\r\nColumbus, the greatest of all explorers, about whom no breath of scandal\r\nin the piratical way was ever breathed, who only escaped being a pirate by\r\nthe fact that his was the first ship to sail in the Caribbean Sea; for\r\nthere is little doubt that had the great navigator found an English ship\r\nlying at anchor when he first arrived at the Island of San Salvador, an\r\nact of piracy would have immediately taken place.\r\n\r\nFor the student who is interested there are other writers who have dealt\r\nwith the subject of piracy, such as the buccaneers Ringrose, Cooke,\r\nFunnell, Dampier, and Cowley; Woodes Rogers, with his \"Voyage to the South\r\nSeas\"; Wafer, who wrote an amusing little book in 1699 describing his\r\nhardships and adventures on the Isthmus of Darien. Of modern writers may\r\nbe recommended Mr. John Masefield's \"Spanish Main,\" \"The Buccaneers in the\r\nWest Indies,\" by C.H. Haring, and the latest publication of the Marine\r\nResearch Society of Massachusetts, entitled \"The Pirates of the New\r\nEngland Coast,\" and last, but far from least, the works of Mr. A. Hyatt\r\nVerrill.\r\n\r\nThe conditions of life on a pirate ship appear to have been much the same\r\nin all vessels. On procuring a craft by stealing or by mutiny of the crew,\r\nthe first thing to do was to elect a commander. This was done by vote\r\namongst the crew, who elected whoever they considered the most daring\r\namongst them, and the best navigator. The next officer chosen was the\r\nquartermaster. The captain and quartermaster once elected, the former\r\ncould appoint any junior officers he chose, and the shares in any plunder\r\nthey took was divided according to the rank of each pirate. The crew were\r\nthen searched for a pirate who could write, and, when found, this scholar\r\nwould be taken down to the great cabin, given pen, ink, and paper, and\r\nafter the articles had been discussed and decided upon, they were written\r\ndown, to be signed by each member of the crew. As an example, the articles\r\ndrawn up by the crew of Captain John Phillips on board the _Revenge_ are\r\ngiven below in full:\r\n\r\n                                1.\r\n\r\n    Every man shall obey civil Command; the Captain shall have one\r\n    full Share and a half in all Prizes; the Master, Carpenter,\r\n    Boatswain and Gunner shall have one Share and quarter.\r\n\r\n                                2.\r\n\r\n    If any Man shall offer to run away, or keep any Secret from\r\n    the Company, he shall be marroon'd with one Bottle of Powder,\r\n    one Bottle of Water, one small Arm, and Shot.\r\n\r\n                                3.\r\n\r\n    If any Man shall steal any Thing in the Company, or game, to\r\n    the value of a Piece of Eight, he shall be Marroon'd or shot.\r\n\r\n                                4.\r\n\r\n    If at any Time we should meet another Marrooner (that is,\r\n    Pyrate,) that Man that shall sign his Articles without the\r\n    Consent of our Company, shall suffer such Punishment as the\r\n    Captain and Company shall think fit.\r\n\r\n                                5.\r\n\r\n    That Man that shall strike another whilst these Articles are\r\n    in force, shall receive Moses's Law (that is 40 Stripes\r\n    lacking one) on the bare Back.\r\n\r\n                                6.\r\n\r\n    That Man that shall snap his Arms, or smoak Tobacco in the\r\n    Hold, without a cap to his Pipe, or carry a Candle lighted\r\n    without a Lanthorn, shall suffer the same Punishment as in the\r\n    former Article.\r\n\r\n                                7.\r\n\r\n    That Man that shall not keep his Arms clean, fit for an\r\n    Engagement, or neglect his Business, shall be cut off from his\r\n    Share, and suffer such other Punishment as the Captain and the\r\n    Company shall think fit.\r\n\r\n                                8.\r\n\r\n    If any Man shall lose a Joint in time of an Engagement, shall\r\n    have 400 Pieces of Eight; if a limb, 800.\r\n\r\n                                9.\r\n\r\n    If at any time you meet with a prudent Woman, that Man that\r\n    offers to meddle with her, without her Consent, shall suffer\r\n    present Death.\r\n\r\nThese formalities took time and much argument and the drinking of many\r\nbowls of punch, and, when once settled, the next business was to make a\r\nflag. The Jolly Roger, consisting of a human skull and two crossed\r\nthigh-bones, was generally portrayed in black and white. Some crews\r\npreferred a study in red and white. More enterprising captains with\r\nimagination and taste, such as Captain Bartholomew Roberts, who was a\r\ntruly remarkable man and the greatest pirate who ever \"declared war upon\r\nall the world,\" aimed at something more elaborate. Roberts flew several\r\nflags, all made to his own design.\r\n\r\nOn one was depicted a \"human anatomy,\" holding a rummer, or glass, of\r\npunch in one bony hand, and a flaming sword in the other. Another\r\nfavourite flag of Roberts had a huge portrait of himself, sword in hand,\r\nand two skulls.\r\n\r\nAnother had a \"skellington\" standing with either foot firmly placed on a\r\nskull, and under one skull were embroidered the letters A.B.H., under the\r\nother A.M.H., which letters stood for a Barbadian's head and a\r\nMartinican's head, to warn any inhabitant of either of these islands what\r\nto expect if he was so unfortunate as to be taken prisoner by Bartholomew,\r\nwho never forgot nor forgave two occasions on which he was very roughly\r\nhandled by ships from Barbadoes and Martinique.\r\n\r\nThe weak point in all pirate ships was the lack of discipline. Time and\r\nagain some successful enterprise, almost completed, was thrown away by\r\nlack of discipline. No captain could be certain of his command or crew. If\r\nhe did anything they disapproved of, the crew would throw him in chains\r\ninto the hold, or as likely overboard, and elect another. It is on record\r\nthat one ship had elected thirteen different commanders in a few months.\r\nSome of the big men retained their commands, Roberts holding the record,\r\nfor a pirate, of four years, until his death; while Bartholomew Sharp\r\nholds the record for a buccaneer.\r\n\r\nHaving procured a vessel, perhaps little more than a fishing-boat,\r\nsometimes only an open row-boat, the embryo pirates would paddle along\r\nsome coast until they came across an unsuspecting craft, one not too big\r\nfor the desperadoes to attack. Hiding their arms, they would row\r\nalongside, and then suddenly, with shouts and curses, board the vessel,\r\nkill any who resisted, and start a cruise in their new ship, their number\r\nbeing increased by volunteers or forced men from amongst the prize's crew.\r\nCruising thus, the pirates would gradually get together a small fleet of\r\nthe fastest and best sailing vessels among their prizes and increase their\r\ncrew as they went along.\r\n\r\nBoth the buccaneers and the pirates had their favourite haunts and places\r\nof rendezvous. These had to be within easy sailing distance of one or more\r\nregular trade routes, and at the same time had to be in some quiet spot\r\nunlikely to be visited by strange craft, and, besides being sheltered\r\nfrom storms, must have a suitable beach on which their vessels could be\r\ncareened and the hulls scraped of barnacles and weeds. The greatest\r\nstronghold of the buccaneers was at Tortuga, or Turtle Island, a small\r\nisland lying off the west coast of Hispaniola. Here in their most piping\r\ndays flourished a buccaneer republic, where the seamen made their own laws\r\nand cultivated the land for sugar-cane and yams. Occasionally the\r\nSpaniards or the French, without any warning, would swoop down on the\r\nsettlement and break up the small republic, but sooner or later the\r\nbuccaneers would be back once again in possession.\r\n\r\nThe favourite and most flourishing headquarters of the West India pirates\r\nwas at New Providence Island in the Bahama Islands, occupied to-day by the\r\nflourishing town of Nassau, now the headquarters of those worthy\r\ndescendants of the pirates, the bootleggers, who from the old port carry\r\non their exciting and profitable smuggling of whisky into the United\r\nStates.\r\n\r\nThe numerous bays and islands lying off the coast of South Carolina were\r\nvery popular with the free booters in the late seventeenth and early\r\neighteenth centuries; while Port Royal, in Jamaica, was noted from early\r\ndays as the port from which the most famous buccaneers sailed for the\r\nSpanish Main, and to which they returned with their plunder.\r\n\r\nThe French filibusters and pirates mostly used the Virgin Islands, while\r\nthe Dutch patronized their own islands of Curaçao, Saba, and St.\r\nEustatius. But the buccaneers did not allow the chance of nationality to\r\ndivide them, for Frenchmen, Englishmen, and Dutchmen, all \"brethren of the\r\ncoast,\" sailed together and plundered the Spaniard in open and equal\r\nfriendship.\r\n\r\nAn entirely different group of pirates arose in the South Seas, with their\r\nheadquarters in Madagascar. Here the pirates went farther towards forming\r\na permanent society than at any other time during their history, with the\r\nexception of the Barbary corsairs, who had their strongly fortified\r\nsettlements for many years at Algiers, Tunis, and Sallee.\r\n\r\nThe origin of the buccaneers is interesting, and I cannot do better than\r\nquote the opening chapter of Clark Russell's \"Life of William Dampier,\" in\r\nthe English Men of Action Series, published by Messrs. Macmillan in 1889.\r\nHe writes:\r\n\r\n\"In or about the middle of the seventeenth century, the Island of San\r\nDomingo, or Hispaniola as it was then called, was haunted and overrun by a\r\nsingular community of savage, surly, fierce, and filthy men. They were\r\nchiefly composed of French colonists, whose ranks had from time to time\r\nbeen enlarged by liberal contributions from the slums and alleys of more\r\nthan one European city and town. These people went dressed in shirts and\r\npantaloons of coarse linen cloth, which they steeped in the blood of the\r\nanimals they slaughtered. They wore round caps, boots of hogskin drawn\r\nover their naked feet, and belts of raw hide, in which they stuck their\r\nsabres and knives. They also armed themselves with firelocks, which threw\r\na couple of balls, each weighing two ounces. The places where they dried\r\nand salted their meat were called _boucans_, and from this term they came\r\nto be styled bucaniers, or buccaneers, as we spell it. They were hunters\r\nby trade, and savages in their habits. They chased and slaughtered horned\r\ncattle and trafficked with the flesh, and their favourite food was raw\r\nmarrow from the bones of the beasts which they shot. They ate and slept on\r\nthe ground, their table was a stone, their bolster the trunk of a tree,\r\nand their roof the hot and sparkling heavens of the Antilles.\"\r\n\r\nThe Spaniards, who were jealous of any other nation than their own having\r\na foothold in America, determined to get rid of these wild but hitherto\r\nharmless buccaneers. This they accomplished, and in time drove the\r\ncattle-hunters out of Hispaniola; and to make sure that the unwelcome\r\nvisitors should not return, they exterminated all the wild cattle. This\r\nwas the worst mistake the Spaniards could have made, for these wild men\r\nhad to look for other means of supporting themselves, and they joined the\r\nfreebooters and thus began the great period of piracy which was the cause\r\nof the ultimate breaking-up of the Spanish power in the West Indies.\r\n\r\nOf the life on board buccaneer and pirate ships a somewhat hazy and\r\nincomplete picture reaches us. The crews were usually large compared with\r\nthe number of men carried in other ships, and a state of crowded\r\ndiscomfort must have been the result, especially in some crazy old vessel\r\ncruising in the tropics or rounding the Horn in winter. Of the\r\nrelationship between the sea-rovers and the fair sex it would be best,\r\nperhaps, to draw a discreet veil. The pirates and the buccaneers looked\r\nupon women simply as the spoils of war, and were as profligate with these\r\nas with the rest of their plunder. I do not know if I am disclosing a\r\nsecret when I mention that my friend Mr. Hyatt Verrill, who is an\r\nauthority on the subject of the lives of the pirates, is about to publish\r\na book devoted to the love affairs of these gentry. I confess to looking\r\nforward with pleasure and a certain degree of trepidation to reading his\r\nbook and to seeing how he will deal with so delicate a subject.\r\n\r\nWe know that Sir Henry Morgan was married and provided for his widow in\r\nhis will.\r\n\r\nCaptain Kidd, wife, and child, resided in New York, in the utmost conjugal\r\nhappiness and respectability, but then Kidd was a martyr and no pirate.\r\n\r\nCaptain Rackam, the dashing \"Calico Jack,\" ran away to sea with the woman\r\npirate, Mrs. Anne Bonny, and they lived together happily on board ship\r\nand on land, as did Captain and Mrs. Cobham. The only other pirate I know\r\nof who took a \"wife\" to sea with him was Captain Pease, who flourished in\r\na half-hearted way--half-hearted in the piratical, but not the matrimonial\r\nsense--in the middle of the nineteenth century.\r\n\r\nA certain settler in New Zealand in the \"early days\" describes a visit he\r\npaid to Captain Pease and his family on board that pirate's handy little\r\nschooner, lying at anchor in a quiet cove at that island.\r\n\r\nOn stepping aboard, the guest was warmly welcomed by a short, red-faced\r\nman, bald of head and rotund in figure, of about fifty-five years of age.\r\nHis appearance suggested a successful grocer rather than a pirate. On the\r\ndeck were seated two ladies, one nearing middle age, the other young and\r\nundoubtedly pretty. At the feet of these ladies sprawled several small\r\nchildren. Captain Pease proceeded to introduce his guest to these as Mrs.\r\nPease No. 1 and Mrs. Pease No. 2. The ladies continued their sewing while\r\na conversation took place on various subjects. Presently, taking out his\r\nwatch, the pirate turned to the younger lady, observing that it was\r\nnearing teatime. Mrs. Pease No. 2, laying down her sewing, went to the\r\ncabin, from which the rattle of teacups and the hiss of a boiling kettle\r\nwere soon heard. Tea being announced as ready, the party entered the\r\ncabin, Mrs. Pease senior taking the place at the head of the table and\r\npouring out the tea while the younger Mrs. Pease very prettily handed\r\nround the cups and bread and butter, the guest particularly noticing with\r\nwhat respect and thoughtfulness she looked after the wants of the elder\r\nMrs. Pease.\r\n\r\nAs a pirate Captain Pease was second or even third rate, confining his\r\ndaring to seizing small unarmed native craft, or robbing the stores of\r\nlonely white traders on out-of-the-way atolls. But as a married man he\r\nshowed himself to be a master; matrimony was his strong suit, domesticity\r\nhis trump card. He gave one valuable hint to his guest, which was this:\r\n\"Never take more than two wives with you on a voyage, _and choose 'em with\r\ncare_.\"\r\n\r\nOne is apt to disassociate serious matrimony, and still less responsible\r\npaternity, with the calling of piracy, but with Captain Pease this was far\r\nfrom being the case. Every one of his wives--for he had others on\r\nshore--contributed her mite, or two, to the growing family, and the\r\nCaptain really could not say which of his offspring he was most proud of.\r\nIt seems at first strange that a man of Captain Pease's appearance,\r\nfigure, and settled habits, almost humdrum, should have been such an\r\nundoubted success with the ladies; but that he was a success there can be\r\nno doubt. Perhaps his calling had a good deal to do with this attraction\r\nhe had for them.\r\n\r\nBefore bringing this Preface to a conclusion, there is one other aspect of\r\npiracy upon which I will touch.\r\n\r\nDeath, portrayed by a skeleton, was the device on the flag beneath which\r\nthey fought; and a skeleton was for ever threatening to emerge from its\r\ncupboard aboard every pirate vessel.\r\n\r\nThe end of most of the pirates and a large proportion of the buccaneers\r\nwas a sudden and violent one, and few of them died in their beds. Many\r\nwere killed in battle, numbers of them were drowned. Not a few drank\r\nthemselves to death with strong Jamaica rum, while many of the buccaneers\r\ndied of malaria and yellow fever contracted in the jungles of Central\r\nAmerica, and most of the pirates who survived these perils lived only to\r\nbe hanged.\r\n\r\nIt is recorded of a certain ex-prizefighter and pirate, Dennis McCarthy,\r\nwho was about to be hanged at New Providence Island in 1718, that, as he\r\nstood on the gallows, all bedecked with coloured ribbons, as became a\r\nboxer, he told his admiring audience that his friends had often, in joke,\r\ntold him he would die in his shoes; and so, to prove them liars, he kicked\r\noff his shoes amongst the crowd, and so died without them.\r\n\r\nThe trial of a pirate was usually a rough and ready business, and the\r\nculprit seldom received the benefit of any doubt that might exist.\r\n\r\nIf he made any defence at all, it was usually to plead that he had been\r\nforced to join the pirates against his wish, and that he had long been\r\nwaiting for an opportunity to escape.\r\n\r\nOnce condemned to death, and the date of execution decided, the prisoner,\r\nif at Newgate, was handed over to the good offices of the prison Ordinary;\r\nor, if in New England, to such vigorous apostles of Christianity as the\r\nRev. Cotton or the Rev. Increase Mather. The former of these two famous\r\ntheologians was pastor of the North Church in Boston, and the author of a\r\nvery rare work published in 1695, called \"An History of Some Criminals\r\nExecuted in This Land.\" Cotton Mather preached many a \"hanging\" sermon to\r\ncondemned pirates, a few of which can still be read. One of these,\r\npreached in 1704, is called \"A Brief Discourse occasioned by a Tragical\r\nSpectacle of a Number of Miserables under Sentence of Death for Piracy.\"\r\n\r\nThe Reverend Doctor made a speciality of these \"hanging\" sermons, and was\r\na thorough master of his subject, as is shown by the following passage\r\ntaken from the above \"Brief Discourse\":\r\n\r\n\"The Privateering Stroke so easily degenerates into the Piratical; and the\r\nPrivateering Trade is usually carried on with an Unchristian Temper, and\r\nproves an Inlet unto so much Debauchery and Iniquity.\"\r\n\r\nOn the Sunday previous to an execution the condemned pirates were taken to\r\nchurch to listen to a sermon while they were \"exhibited\" to the crowded\r\nand gaping congregation. On the day of the execution a procession was\r\nformed, which marched from the gaol to the gallows.\r\n\r\nAt the head was carried a silver oar, the emblem from very early days of a\r\npirate execution. Arrived at the gibbet, the prisoner, who always dressed\r\nhimself in his, or someone else's, best clothes, would doff his hat and\r\nmake a speech.\r\n\r\nSometimes the bolder spirits would speak in a defiant and unrepentant way;\r\nbut most of them professed a deep repentance for their sins and warned\r\ntheir listeners to guard against the temptation of drink and avarice.\r\nAfter the prisoner's death the bodies of the more notorious pirates were\r\ntaken down and hanged in chains at some prominent spot where ships passed,\r\nin order to be a warning to any mariners who had piratical leanings.\r\n\r\nThe number of pirates or buccaneers who died in their beds must have been\r\nvery small, particularly amongst the former; and I have been able to trace\r\nbut a single example of a tombstone marking the burial-place of a pirate.\r\nThis is, or was until recently, to be found in the graveyard at Dartmouth,\r\nand records the resting-place of the late Captain Thomas Goldsmith, who\r\ncommanded the _Snap Dragon_, of Dartmouth, in which vessel he amassed much\r\nriches during the reign of Queen Anne, and died, apparently not regretted,\r\nin 1714. Engraved upon his headstone are the following lines:\r\n\r\n    Men that are virtuous serve the Lord;\r\n    And the Devil's by his friends ador'd;\r\n    And as they merit get a place\r\n    Amidst the bless'd or hellish race;\r\n    Pray then ye learned clergy show\r\n    Where can this brute, Tom Goldsmith, go?\r\n    Whose life was one continual evil\r\n    Striving to cheat God, Man and Devil.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PIRATES' WHO'S WHO\r\n\r\n\r\nAISA. Barbary corsair.\r\n\r\nA famous Mediterranean pirate, and one of Dragut's admirals in the\r\nsixteenth century.\r\n\r\n\r\nALCANTRA, CAPTAIN MANSEL.\r\n\r\nA Spaniard. Commanded a pirate brig, the _Macrinarian_. Committed many\r\noutrages. Took the Liverpool packet _Topaz_, from Calcutta to Boston, in\r\n1829, near St. Helena, murdering the whole crew. In the same year he took\r\nthe _Candace_, from Marblehead, and plundered her. The supercargo of the\r\n_Candace_ was an amateur actor, and had on board a priest's black gown and\r\nbroad brimmed hat. These he put on and sat in his cabin pretending to tell\r\nhis beads. On the pirates coming to rob him, they all crossed themselves\r\nand left him, so that he alone of the whole company was not robbed.\r\n\r\n\r\nALEXANDER, JOHN.\r\n\r\nA Scotch buccaneer; one of Captain Sharp's crew. Drowned on May 9th, 1681.\r\nCaptain Sharp, with a party of twenty-four men, had landed on the Island\r\nof Chiva, off the coast of Peru, and taken several prisoners, amongst whom\r\nwas a shipwright and his man, who were actually at work building two great\r\nships for the Spaniards. Sharp, thinking these men would be very useful to\r\nhim, took them away, with all their tools and a quantity of ironwork, in a\r\ndory, to convey them off to his ship. But the dory, being overladen,\r\nsank, and Alexander was drowned. On the evening of May 12th his body was\r\nfound; which they took up, and next day \"threw him overboard, giving him\r\nthree French vollies for his customary ceremony.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nALI BASHA.\r\n\r\nOf Algiers. Barbary corsair.\r\n\r\nConquered the Kingdom of Tunis in the sixteenth century, and captured many\r\nMaltese galleys. He brought the development of organized piracy to its\r\ngreatest perfection.\r\n\r\nIn 1571 Ali Basha commanded a fleet of no fewer than 250 Moslem galleys in\r\nthe battle of Lepanto, when he was severely defeated, but escaped with his\r\nlife.\r\n\r\n\r\nALLESTON, CAPTAIN.\r\n\r\nCommanded a vessel of eighteen tons, no guns, and a crew of twenty-four.\r\nIn March, 1679, sailed in company with eight other vessels, under command\r\nof Captain Harris, to the Coast of Darien, and marched on foot across the\r\nisthmus, on his way attacking and sacking Santa Maria.\r\n\r\n\r\nAMAND or ANNAND, ALEXANDER.\r\n\r\nOf Jamaica.\r\n\r\nOne of Major Stede Bonnet's crew in the _Royal James_. Hanged on November\r\n8th, 1718, at White Point, Charleston, South Carolina, and buried in the\r\nmarsh below low-water mark.\r\n\r\n\r\nAMEER, IBRAHIM.\r\n\r\nAn admiral of an Arabian fleet of Red Sea pirates. In 1816 he captured\r\nfour British merchant vessels on their way to Surat.\r\n\r\n\r\nANDRESON, CAPTAIN CORNELIUS.\r\n\r\nA Dutch pirate. Sailed from Boston in 1674 with Captain Roderigo to\r\nplunder English ships along the coast of Maine, in a vessel called the\r\n_Penobscot Shallop_.\r\n\r\nTried at Cambridge, Massachusetts, sentenced to death, but later on\r\npardoned. Afterwards fought very bravely for the English colonists against\r\nthe Indians.\r\n\r\n\r\nANDROEAS, CAPTAIN.\r\n\r\nA Chief or Captain of the Darien Indians, who in 1679 conducted the\r\nbuccaneers under Coxon and Harris across the isthmus to attack Santa Maria\r\nand afterwards to make an attempt on Panama.\r\n\r\nCaptain Androeas had a great esteem for the English, partly because the\r\nbuccaneers were kind to the Indians, and partly because of the Indians'\r\nfear and hatred of the Spaniards. He afterwards led back a party of\r\nmalcontents under Captain Coxon from the Pacific side of the isthmus.\r\n\r\n\r\nANGORA, Sultan of Timor.\r\n\r\nRefusing to allow the East India Company to station garrisons on Timor, he\r\nwas driven out of the whole of his island except the chief town, also\r\ncalled Angora.\r\n\r\nDeciding to take revenge, he turned pirate and went to sea in command of a\r\nsmall fleet of five well-armed prows and several galleys. His first prize\r\nwas a packet brig carrying despatches from Calcutta to the English General\r\nbefore Angora. Captain Hastings, the commander, a near relation of Warren\r\nHastings, and a gallant officer, had thrown the despatches overboard, for\r\nwhich he was hanged, while the crew were sent to prison at Angora and\r\nafterwards poisoned. His next prize was an East Indian ship, the _Edward_,\r\nCaptain Harford, the crew of which were also poisoned. Cruising off Bombay\r\nhe defeated a vessel sent out by the Government to attack him. After\r\ntaking other English vessels, Angora met with a richly laden ship from\r\nBurmah, a country whose sovereign he was on friendly terms with, but the\r\nSultan-pirate took this ship and drowned every soul on board except one\r\nwoman, who, owing to her great beauty, he kept for himself. His next\r\nvictim was a well-armed Malay praam, which he captured after a severe\r\nfight. The crew he shackled and threw overboard, while he burnt the\r\nvessel. Paying another visit to Bombay, he caught the garrison unprepared,\r\nblew up the fort, and sailed off with some sheep, cows, and pigs. A few\r\ndays later the pirate seized an English packet, _St. George_, and after he\r\nhad tortured to death the captain, the terrified crew joined his service.\r\nReturning to Timor with his plunder, he was surprised by the arrival off\r\nthe port of H.M.S. _Victorious_, seventy-four guns, which had been sent to\r\ntake him. Slipping out of harbour unobserved in the night in his fastest\r\nsailing praam, he escaped to Trincomalee in Ceylon, where the East India\r\nCompany decided to allow him to remain undisturbed.\r\n\r\n\r\nANGRIA.\r\n\r\nBrother of a famous pirate, Angora, Sultan of Timor. When the Sultan\r\nretired from practice to the Island of Ceylon he gave his brother his\r\npraam, a fast vessel armed with thirty-eight guns.\r\n\r\nAngria's brother Angora had been dethroned from the Island of Timor by the\r\nEnglish Government, and this had prevented the former from all hope of\r\nsucceeding as Sultan. Owing to this, Angria, a very vindictive man,\r\nnursed against the English Government a very real grievance. Declaring\r\nhimself Sultan of another smaller island, Little Timor, he sailed out to\r\nlook for spoil. His first victim was the _Elphinston_, which he took some\r\neighty miles off Bombay. Putting the crew of forty-seven men into an open\r\nboat, without water, and with scarcely room to move, he left them. It was\r\nin the hottest month of the year, and only twenty-eight of them reached\r\nBombay alive.\r\n\r\nAngria, being broad-minded on the subject of his new profession, did not\r\nlimit himself to taking only English vessels, for meeting with two Chinese\r\njunks, laden with spices and riches, he plundered them both, and tying the\r\ncrew back to back threw them into the sea to drown. One of the Chinamen,\r\nwhile watching his companions being drowned, managed to get a hand free\r\nfrom his ropes, and, taking his dagger, stabbed Angria, but, missing his\r\nheart, only wounded him in the shoulder. To punish him the pirate had the\r\nskin cut off his back and then had him beaten with canes. Then lashing him\r\nfirmly down to a raft he was thrown overboard. After drifting about for\r\nthree days and nights he was picked up, still alive, by a fishing-boat and\r\ncarried to Bombay, where, fully recovered, he lived the rest of his days.\r\n\r\nAngria continued his activities for three years, during which space he was\r\nsaid to have murdered in cold blood over 500 Englishmen. He was eventually\r\nchased by Commander Jones in H.M.S. _Asia_, sixty-four guns, into Timor,\r\nand after a close siege of the town for twelve months, Angria was shot by\r\none of the mob while haranguing them from a balcony.\r\n\r\nAfter Commander Jones's death his widow built a tower at Shooter's Hill,\r\nby Woolwich Common, to perpetuate the memory of her husband who had rid\r\nthe Indian Ocean of the tyrant Angria.\r\n\r\nThe following lines are from the pen of Robert Bloomfield, and allude to\r\nthis monument:\r\n\r\n    Yon far-famed monumental tower\r\n    Records the achievements of the brave,\r\n    And Angria's subjugated power,\r\n    Who plunder'd on the Eastern Wave.\r\n\r\n\r\nANSTIS, CAPTAIN THOMAS.\r\n\r\nThe first mention of the name of this notorious pirate occurs in the year\r\n1718, when we hear of him shipping himself at Providence in a sloop called\r\nthe _Buck_ in company with five other rascals who were conspiring together\r\nto seize the vessel and with her go \"a-pyrating.\"\r\n\r\nOf these five, one was Howel Davis, who was afterwards killed in an affair\r\nat the Island of Princes; another, Denman Topping, who was killed in the\r\ntaking of a rich Portuguese ship on the coast of Brazil; a third, Walter\r\nKennedy, was eventually hanged at Execution Dock, while the two others,\r\nwho escaped the usual end of pirates--that is, by hanging, shooting, or\r\ndrowning in saltwater or rum--disappeared into respectable obscurity in\r\nemployment of some sort in the City of London.\r\n\r\nThis party of six conspirators was the nucleus of a very powerful\r\ncombination of pirates, which eventually came under the command of the\r\nfamous Captain Roberts.\r\n\r\nAnstis's pirate career began as did most others. They cruised about\r\namongst the West India Islands, seizing and plundering all merchant ships\r\nthey chanced upon, and, if we are to believe some of the stories that were\r\ncirculated at the time of their treatment of their prisoners, they appear\r\nto have been an even rougher lot of scoundrels than was usual.\r\n\r\nBefore long they seized a very stout ship, the _Morning Star_, bound from\r\nGuinea to Carolina, and fitted her up with thirty-two cannons taken from\r\nanother prize; manned her with a crew of one hundred men, and put Captain\r\nJohn Fenn in command. Anstis, as the elder officer, could have had command\r\nof this newer and larger ship, but he was so in love with his own vessel,\r\nthe _Good Fortune_, which was an excellent sailer, that he preferred to\r\nremain in her.\r\n\r\nThe party now had two stout ships, but, as so often happened, trouble\r\nbegan to ferment amongst the crew. A large number of these had been more\r\nor less forced to \"go a-pyrating,\" and were anxious to avoid the\r\nconsequences, so they decided to send a round-robin--that is, a\r\npetition--signed by all with their names in a circle so that no rogue\r\ncould be held to be more prominent than any other, to ask for the King's\r\npardon.\r\n\r\nThis round-robin was addressed to \"his most sacred Majesty George, by the\r\nGrace of God, of Great Britain, France, and Ireland, King, Defender of the\r\nFaith,\" etc.\r\n\r\nThis petition was sent to England by a merchant vessel then sailing from\r\nJamaica, while the crews hid their ships amongst the mangrove swamps of a\r\nsmall uninhabited island off the coast of Cuba. Here they waited for nine\r\nmonths for an answer to their petition to the King, living on turtle,\r\nfish, rice, and, of course, rum _ad lib._ as long as it lasted.\r\n\r\nTo pass the time various diversions were instigated, particularly\r\ndancing--a pastime in great favour amongst pirates. We have a most amusing\r\naccount left us of a mock court of justice held by them to try one another\r\nof piracy, and he who was on one day tried as the prisoner would next day\r\ntake his turn at being Judge.\r\n\r\nThis shows a grim sense of humour, as most of those who took part in these\r\nmock trials were certain to end their careers before a real trial unless\r\nthey came to a sudden and violent end beforehand.\r\n\r\nHere is an account of one such mock-trial as given to Captain Johnson, the\r\nhistorian of the pirates, by an eyewitness:\r\n\r\n\"The Court and Criminals being both appointed, as also Council to plead,\r\nthe Judge got up in a Tree, and had a dirty Taurpaulin hung over his\r\nshoulder; this was done by Way of Robe, with a Thrum Cap on his Head, and\r\na large Pair of Spectacles upon his Nose. Thus equipp'd, he settled\r\nhimself in his Place; and abundance of Officers attending him below, with\r\nCrows, Handspikes, etc., instead of Wands, Tipstaves, and such like....\r\nThe Criminals were brought out, making a thousand sour Faces; and one who\r\nacted as Attorney-General opened the Charge against them; their Speeches\r\nwere very laconick, and their whole Proceedings concise. We shall give it\r\nby Way of Dialogue.\r\n\r\n\"Attor. Gen.: 'An't please your Lordship, and you Gentlemen of the Jury,\r\nhere is a Fellow before you that is a sad Dog, a sad sad Dog; and I humbly\r\nhope your Lordship will order him to be hang'd out of the Way\r\nimmediately....

But this is not all, my Lord, he has committed worse Villanies\r\nthan all these, for we shall prove, that he has been guilty of drinking\r\nSmall-Beer; and your Lordship knows, there never was a sober Fellow but\r\nwhat was a Rogue.

There's Law for you, ye Dog.... So\r\ntake him away Gaoler.'\"\r\n\r\nIn August, 1722, the pirates sailed out from their hiding-place and\r\nwaylaid the ship which was returning to Jamaica with the answer to the\r\npetition, but to their disappointment heard that no notice had been taken\r\nof their round-robin by the Government at home.\r\n\r\nNo time was lost in returning to their old ways, for the very next day\r\nboth pirate ships left their hiding-place and sailed out on the \"grand\r\naccount.\"\r\n\r\nBut now their luck deserted them, for the _Morning Star_ was run aground\r\non a reef by gross neglect on the part of the officers and wrecked. Most\r\nof the crew escaped on to an island, where Captain Anstis found them next\r\nday, and no sooner had he taken aboard Captain Fenn, Phillips, the\r\ncarpenter, and a few others, than all of a sudden down upon them came two\r\nmen-of-war, the _Hector_ and the _Adventure_, so that Anstis had barely\r\ntime to cut his cables and get away to sea, hotly pursued by the\r\n_Adventure_. The latter, in a stiff breeze, was slowly gaining on the\r\nbrigantine when all of a sudden the wind dropped, the pirates got out the\r\nsweeps, and thus managed, for the time being, to escape. In the meantime\r\nthe _Hector_ took prisoner the forty pirates remaining on the island.\r\n\r\nAnstis soon got to work again, and captured several prizes. He then sailed\r\nto the Island of Tobago to clean and refit his ship. Just when all the\r\nguns and stores had been landed and the ship heeled, as ill-luck would\r\nhave it, the _Winchester_, man-of-war, put into the bay; and the pirates\r\nhad barely time to set their ship on fire and to escape into the woods.\r\nAnstis had by now lost all authority over his discontented crew, and one\r\nnight was shot while asleep in his hammock.\r\n\r\n\r\nANTONIO.\r\n\r\nCaptain of the Darien Indians and friend to the English buccaneers.\r\n\r\n\r\nARCHER, JOHN ROSE.\r\n\r\nHe learnt his art as a pirate in the excellent school of the notorious\r\nBlackbeard.\r\n\r\nIn 1723 he was, for the time being, in honest employment in a Newfoundland\r\nfishing-boat, which was captured by Phillips and his crew. As Phillips was\r\nonly a beginner at piracy, he was very glad to get the aid of such an old\r\nhand at the game as John Archer, whom he promptly appointed to the office\r\nof quartermaster in the pirate ship. This quick promotion caused some\r\nmurmuring amongst Phillips's original crew, the carpenter, Fern, being\r\nparticularly outspoken against it.\r\n\r\nArcher ended his days on the gallows at Boston on June 2nd, 1724, and we\r\nread that he \"dy'd very penitent, with the assistance of two grave Divines\r\nto attend him.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nARGALL.\r\n\r\nLicensed and titled buccaneer.\r\n\r\nBelieved to have buried a rich treasure in the Isles of Shoals, off\r\nPortsmouth, New Hampshire, in the seventeenth century.\r\n\r\n\r\nARMSTRONG.\r\n\r\nBorn in London. A deserter from the Royal Navy. One of Captain Roberts's\r\ncrew taken by H.M.S. _Swallow_, from which ship he had previously\r\ndeserted.\r\n\r\nIn an account of his execution on board H.M.S. _Weymouth_ we read: \"Being\r\non board a Man of War there was no Body to press him to an Acknowledgement\r\nof the Crime he died for, nor of sorrowing in particular for it, which\r\nwould have been exemplary, and made suitable Impressions on seamen; so\r\nthat his last Hour was spent in lamenting and bewailing his Sins in\r\ngeneral, exhorting the Spectators to an honest and good life, in which\r\nalone they could find Satisfaction.\"\r\n\r\nThis painful scene ended by the condemned singing with the spectators a\r\nfew verses of the 140th Psalm: at the conclusion of which, at the firing\r\nof a gun, \"he was tric'd up at the Fore Yard.\"\r\n\r\nDied at the age of 34.\r\n\r\n\r\nARNOLD, SION.\r\n\r\nA Madagascar pirate, who was brought to New England by Captain Shelley in\r\n1699.\r\n\r\n\r\nASHPLANT, VALENTINE.\r\n\r\nBorn in the Minories, London. He served with Captain Howell Davis, and\r\nlater with Bartholomew Roberts. He was one of the leading lights of\r\nRoberts's crew, a member of the \"House of Lords.\"\r\n\r\nHe took part in the capture and plundering of the _King Solomon_ at Cape\r\nApollonia, North-West Coast of Africa, in January, 1719, when the pirates,\r\nin an open boat, attacked the ship while at anchor. Ashplant was taken\r\nprisoner two years later by H.M.S. _Swallow_. Tried for piracy at Cape\r\nCoast Castle and found guilty in March, 1722, and hanged in chains there\r\nat the age of 32.\r\n\r\n\r\nATWELL.\r\n\r\nA hand aboard the brig _Vineyard_ in 1830, he took part with Charles Gibbs\r\nand others in a mutiny in which both the captain and mate was murdered.\r\n\r\n\r\nAUGUR, CAPTAIN JOHN.\r\n\r\nA pirate of New Providence, Bahama Islands. He accepted the royal pardon\r\nin 1718, and impressed the Governor, Woodes Rogers, so favourably that he\r\nwas placed in command of a sloop to go and trade amongst the islands. A\r\nfew days out Augur met with two sloops, \"the sight of which dispelled all\r\nmemory of their late good intention,\" and turning pirates once more, they\r\nseized the two sloops and took out of them money and goods to the value of\r\n£500.\r\n\r\nThe pirates now sailed for Hispaniola, but with bad luck, or owing to\r\nretribution, a sudden hurricane arose which drove them back to the one\r\nspot in the West Indies they must have been most anxious to avoid--that\r\nis, the Bahama Islands. Here the sloop became a total wreck, but the crew\r\ngot ashore and for a while lay hidden in a wood. Rogers, hearing where\r\nthey were, sent an armed sloop to the island, and the captain by fair\r\npromises induced the eleven marooned pirates to come aboard. Taking these\r\nback to Providence, Rogers had them all tried before a court of lately\r\nconverted pirates, and they were condemned to be hanged. While standing\r\non the gallows platform the wretched culprits reproached the crowd of\r\nspectators, so lately their fellow-brethren in piracy, for allowing their\r\nold comrades to be hanged, and urging them to come to the rescue. But\r\nvirtue was still strong in these recent converts, and all the comfort the\r\ncriminals got was to be told \"it was their Business to turn their Minds to\r\nanother World, and sincerely to repent of what Wickedness they had done in\r\nthis.\" \"Yes,\" answered the now irritated and in no-wise abashed Augur, \"I\r\n_do_ heartily repent: I repent I have not done more Mischief, and that we\r\ndid not cut the Throats of them that took us, and I am extremely sorry\r\nthat you an't all hang'd as well as we.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nAUSTIN, JAMES.\r\n\r\nCaptured with the rest of Captain John Quelch's crew in the brigantine\r\n_Charles_. Escaped for a time, but was caught and secured in the gaol at\r\nPiscataqua, and later on tried for piracy at the Star Tavern at Boston in\r\nJune, 1704.\r\n\r\n\r\nAVERY, CAPTAIN JOHN, _alias_ HENRY EVERY, _alias_ CAPTAIN BRIDGEMAN.\r\nNicknamed \"Long Ben,\" or the \"Arch-Pirate.\"\r\n\r\nIn the year 1695, when at the height of his career, Avery caught the\r\npublic's fancy as no other pirate ever did, with the possible exception of\r\nCaptain Kidd. So much so that his achievements, or supposed achievements,\r\nformed the plot of several popular novels and plays.\r\n\r\nCharles Johnson wrote a play called \"The Successful Pyrate,\" which work\r\nran into several editions, and was acted at the Theatre Royal in Drury\r\nLane.\r\n\r\nThe scene in this play was laid in the Island of Madagascar, and the hero\r\nwas modelled on Captain Avery.\r\n\r\nThis pirate was a Devonshire man, being born near Plymouth about the year\r\n1665, and was bred to the sea. He sailed on several voyages as mate aboard\r\na merchantman. He was later appointed first officer in an armed privateer\r\n_The Duke_, Commander Captain Gibson, which sailed from Bristol for Spain,\r\nbeing hired by the Spaniards for service in the West Indies against the\r\nFrench pirates.\r\n\r\nAvery soon plotted a mutiny, which was carried out while _The Duke_ lay at\r\nanchor in Cadiz Harbour; the ship was seized, and the captain put ashore.\r\nAvery was elected captain, and he renamed the ship the _Charles the\r\nSecond_. For more than a year Avery sailed in this vessel, preying without\r\ndistinction upon persons of all nations and religions.\r\n\r\nAfter leaving Spain he first sailed to the Isle of May, holding the\r\nPortuguese governor for ransom till provisions were sent on board. He took\r\nnear here three English ships, then sailed to the coast of Guinea to\r\nprocure slaves. To catch these Avery would anchor off a village and hoist\r\nEnglish colours. The trusting negroes would then paddle off to the ship in\r\ncanoes, bringing gold to traffic with. At a given signal these natives\r\nwould be seized, clapped in irons, and thrown into the hold.\r\n\r\nAvery next sailed to the Island of Princes, where he attacked two Danish\r\nships, and took them both. The next place the pirates touched at was\r\nMadagascar, from there they sailed to the Red Sea to await the fleet\r\nexpected from Mocha. To pass the time and to earn an honest penny the\r\npirates called in at a town called Meat, there to sell to the natives some\r\nof their stolen merchandise. But the cautious inhabitants refused to do\r\nany business with these suspicious looking merchants, so in order to\r\npunish them the pirates burnt down their town. They next visited Aden,\r\nwhere they met two other English pirate ships, and were soon joined by\r\nthree others from America, all on the same enterprise.\r\n\r\nExpecting the Mocha fleet to come along, they waited here, but the fleet\r\nslipped past the pirates in the night. Avery was after them the next\r\nmorning, and catching them up, singled out the largest ship, fought her\r\nfor two hours, and took her. She proved to be the _Gunsway_, belonging to\r\nthe Great Mogul himself, and a very valuable prize, as out of her they\r\ntook 100,000 pieces of eight and a like number of chequins, as well as\r\nseveral of the highest persons of the court who were passengers on a\r\npilgrimage to Mecca. It was rumoured that a daughter of the Great Mogul\r\nwas also on board. Accounts of this exploit eventually reached England,\r\nand created great excitement, so that it soon became the talk of the town\r\nthat Captain Avery had taken the beautiful young princess to Madagascar,\r\nwhere he had married her and was living in royal state, the proud father\r\nof several small princes and princesses.\r\n\r\nThe Mogul was naturally infuriated at this outrage on his ship, and\r\nthreatened in retaliation to lay waste all the East India Company's\r\nsettlements.\r\n\r\nHaving got a vast booty, Avery and his friends sailed towards Madagascar,\r\nand on the way there Avery, as admiral of the little fleet, signalled to\r\nthe captain of the other sloops to come aboard his vessel. When they\r\narrived Avery put before them the following ingenious scheme. He proposed\r\nthat the treasures in the two sloops should, for safety, be put into his\r\nkeeping till they all three arrived in Madagascar. This, being agreed to,\r\nwas done, but during the night, after Avery had explained matters to his\r\nown men, he altered his course and left the sloops, and never saw them\r\nagain. He now sailed away with all the plunder to the West Indies,\r\narriving safely at New Providence Island in the Bahamas, where he offered\r\nthe Governor a bribe of twenty pieces of eight and two pieces of gold to\r\nget him a pardon. Avery arrived in 1696 at Boston, where he appears to\r\nhave successfully bribed the Quaker Governor to let him and some of his\r\ncrew land with their spoils unmolested. But the pirate did not feel quite\r\nsafe, and also thought it would be wellnigh impossible to sell his\r\ndiamonds in the colony without being closely questioned as to how he came\r\nby them. So, leaving America, he sailed to the North of Ireland, where he\r\nsold the sloop. Here the crew finally dispersed, and Avery stopped some\r\ntime in Dublin, but was still unable to dispose of his stolen diamonds.\r\nThinking England would be a better place for this transaction, he went\r\nthere, and settled at Bideford in Devon. Here he lived very quietly under\r\na false name, and through a friend communicated with certain merchants in\r\nBristol. These came to see him, accepted his diamonds and some gold cups,\r\ngiving him a few pounds for his immediate wants, and took the valuables to\r\nBristol to sell, promising to send him the money procured for them. Time\r\ndragged on, but nothing came from the Bristol merchants, and at last it\r\nbegan to dawn on Avery that there were pirates on land as well as at sea.\r\nHis frequent letters to the merchants brought at the most but a few\r\noccasional shillings, which were immediately swallowed up by the payment\r\nof his debts for the bare necessities of life at Bideford. At length, when\r\nmatters were becoming desperate, Avery was taken ill and died \"not being\r\nworth as much as would buy him a coffin.\" Thus ended Avery, \"the Grand\r\nPirate,\" whose name was known all over Europe, and who was supposed to be\r\nreigning as a king in Madagascar when all the while he was hiding and\r\nstarving in a cottage at Bideford.\r\n\r\n\r\nAYLETT, CAPTAIN.\r\n\r\nThis buccaneer was killed by an explosion of gunpowder on board the\r\n_Oxford_ during a banquet of Morgan's captains off Hispaniola in 1669.\r\n\r\n\r\nBAILY, JOB, or BAYLEY.\r\n\r\nOf London.\r\n\r\nOne of Major Stede Bonnet's crew. Hanged at Charleston in 1718.\r\n\r\n\r\nBAKER, CAPTAIN.\r\n\r\nOne of Gasparilla's gang up to 1822, when they were broken up by the\r\nUnited States Navy. His favourite hunting-ground was the Gulf of Mexico.\r\n\r\n\r\nBALL, ROGER.\r\n\r\nOne of Captain Bartholomew's crew in the _Royal Fortune_. Captured by\r\nH.M.S. _Swallow_ off the West Coast of Africa. He had been terribly burnt\r\nby an explosion of a barrel of gunpowder, and while seated \"in a private\r\ncorner, with a look as sullen as winter,\" a surgeon of the king's ship\r\ncame up and asked him how he came to be blown up in that frightful manner.\r\n\"Why,\" says he, \"John Morris fired a pistol into the powder, and if he had\r\nnot done it, I would.\" The surgeon, with great kindness, offered to dress\r\nthe prisoner's wounds, but Ball, although in terrible pain, refused to\r\nallow them to be touched. He died the same night.\r\n\r\n\r\nBALLET, JOHN. Buccaneer.\r\n\r\nThird mate on board Woodes Rogers's ship, the _Duke_, but was by\r\nprofession a surgeon, in which latter capacity he had sailed on a previous\r\nvoyage with Dampier.\r\n\r\n\r\nBALTIZAR, CAPTAIN.\r\n\r\nA terror to all shipping in the Gulf of Mexico in the early part of the\r\nnineteenth century. Brought to Boston as a prisoner in 1823, taken thence\r\nto Kingston, Jamaica, and there hanged. For some extraordinary reason the\r\nAmerican juries seldom would condemn a pirate to death, so that whenever\r\npossible the pirate prisoners were handed over to the English, who made\r\nshort shift with them.\r\n\r\n\r\nBANNISTER, CAPTAIN.\r\n\r\nRan away from Port Royal, Jamaica, in June, 1684, on a \"privateering\"\r\nventure in a ship of thirty guns. Caught and brought back by the frigate\r\n_Ruby_, and put on trial by the Lieutenant-Governor Molesworth, who was at\r\nthat time very active in his efforts to stamp out piracy in the West\r\nIndies.\r\n\r\nBannister entirely escaped punishment, capital or otherwise, as he was\r\nreleased by the grand jury on a technical point, surely most rare good\r\nfortune for the captain in days when the law was elastic enough to fit\r\nmost crimes, and was far from lenient on piracy. Six months later the\r\nindefatigable captain again eluded the forts, and for two years succeeded\r\nin dodging the frigates sent out by Governor Molesworth to capture him.\r\nFinally, in January, 1687, Captain Spragge sailed victoriously into Port\r\nRoyal with Bannister and three other buccaneers hanging at the yard-arm,\r\n\"a spectacle of great satisfaction to all good people, and of terror to\r\nthe favourers of pirates.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nBARBAROSSA, or \"REDBEARD\" (his real name was URUJ). Barbary Corsair.\r\n\r\nSon of a Turkish renegade and a Christian mother. Born in the Island of\r\nLesbon in the Ægean Sea, a stronghold of the Mediterranean pirates.\r\n\r\nIn 1504 Barbarossa made his headquarters at Tunis, in return for which he\r\npaid the Sultan one-fifth of all the booty he took. One of his first and\r\nboldest exploits was the capture of two richly laden galleys belonging to\r\nPope Julius II., on their way from Genoa to Civita Vecchia. Next year he\r\ncaptured a Spanish ship with 500 soldiers on board. In 1512 he was invited\r\nby the Moors to assist them in an attempt to retake the town and port of\r\nBujeya from the Spaniards. After eight days of fighting, Barbarossa lost\r\nan arm, and the siege was given up, but he took away with him a large\r\nGenoese ship. In 1516 Barbarossa changed his headquarters to Jijil, and\r\ntook command of an army of 6,000 men and sixteen galliots, with which he\r\nattacked and captured the Spanish fortress of Algiers, of which he became\r\nSultan. Barbarossa was by now vastly rich and powerful, his fleets\r\nbringing in prizes from Genoa, Naples, Venice, and Spain.\r\n\r\nEventually Charles V. of Spain sent an army of 10,000 troops to North\r\nAfrica, defeated the corsairs, and Barbarossa was slain in battle.\r\n\r\n\r\nBARBE, CAPTAIN NICHOLAS.\r\n\r\nMaster of a Breton ship, the _Mychell_, of St. Malo, owned by Hayman\r\nGillard. Captured by an English ship in 1532. Her crew was made up of nine\r\nBretons and five Scots.\r\n\r\n\r\nBARNARD, CAPTAIN. Buccaneer.\r\n\r\nIn June, 1663, this buccaneer sailed from Port Royal to the Orinoco. He\r\ntook and plundered the town of Santo Tomas, and returned the following\r\nMarch.\r\n\r\n\r\nBARNES, CAPTAIN.\r\n\r\nIn 1677 several English privateers surprised and sacked the town of Santa\r\nMarta in the Spanish Main. To save the town from being burnt, the\r\nGovernor and Bishop became hostages until a ransom had been paid. These\r\nthe pirates, under the command of Captains Barnes and Coxon, carried back\r\nto Jamaica and delivered up to Lord Vaughan, the Governor of the island.\r\nVaughan treated the Bishop well, and hired a vessel specially to send him\r\nback to Castagona, for which kindness \"the good old man was exceedingly\r\npleased.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nBARNES, HENRY.\r\n\r\nOf Barbadoes.\r\n\r\nTried for piracy at Newport in 1723, but found to be not guilty.\r\n\r\n\r\nBARROW, JAMES.\r\n\r\nTaken by Captain Roberts out of the _Martha_ snow (Captain Lady). Turned\r\npirate and served in the _Ranger_ in 1721.\r\n\r\n\r\nBELLAMY, CAPTAIN CHARLES. Pirate, Socialist, and orator. A famous West\r\nIndian filibuster.\r\n\r\nHe began life as a wrecker in the West Indies, but this business being\r\nuncertain in its profits, and Bellamy being an ambitious young man, he\r\ndecided with his partner, Paul Williams, to aim at higher things, and to\r\nenter the profession of piracy. Bellamy had now chosen a calling that lent\r\nitself to his undoubted talents, and his future career, while it lasted,\r\nwas a brilliant one.\r\n\r\nProcuring a ship, he sailed up and down the coast of Carolina and New\r\nEngland, taking and plundering numerous vessels; and when this\r\nneighbourhood became too hot for him he would cruise for a while in the\r\ncooler climate of Newfoundland.\r\n\r\nBellamy had considerable gifts for public speaking, and seldom missed an\r\nopportunity of addressing the assembled officers and crews of the ships\r\nhe took, before liberating or otherwise disposing of them.\r\n\r\nHis views were distinctly Socialistic. On one occasion, in an address to a\r\nCaptain Beer, who had pleaded to have his sloop returned to him, Captain\r\nBellamy, after clearing his throat, began as follows: \"I am sorry,\" he\r\nsaid, \"that you can't have your sloop again, for I scorn to do anyone any\r\nmischief--when it is not to my advantage--though you are a sneaking puppy,\r\nand so are all those who will submit to be governed by laws which rich men\r\nhave made for their own security, for the cowardly whelps have not the\r\ncourage otherwise to defend what they get by their knavery. But damn ye\r\naltogether for a pack of crafty rascals, and you, who serve them, for a\r\nparcel of hen-hearted numbskulls! They vilify us, the scoundrels do, when\r\nthere is the only difference that they rob the poor under cover of the\r\nlaw, forsooth, and we plunder the rich under the protection of our own\r\ncourage. Had you not better make one of us than sneak after these villains\r\nfor employment?\"\r\n\r\nBellamy's fall came at last at the hands of a whaler captain. At the time\r\nhe was in command of the _Whidaw_ and a small fleet of other pirate craft,\r\nwhich was lying at anchor in the Bay of Placentia in Newfoundland. Sailing\r\nfrom Placentia for Nantucket Shoals, he seized a whaling vessel, the _Mary\r\nAnne_. As the skipper of the whaler knew the coast well, Bellamy made him\r\npilot of his small fleet. The cunning skipper one night ran his ship on to\r\na sand-bank near Eastman, Massachusetts, and the rest of the fleet\r\nfollowed his stern light on to the rocks. Almost all the crews perished,\r\nonly seven of the pirates being saved. These were seized and brought to\r\ntrial, condemned, and hanged at Boston in 1726. The days spent between the\r\nsentence and the hanging were not wasted, for we read in a contemporary\r\naccount that \"by the indefatigable pains of a pious and learned divine,\r\nwho constantly attended them, they were at length, by the special grace of\r\nGod, made sensible of and truly penitent for the enormous crimes they had\r\nbeen guilty of.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nBELVIN, JAMES.\r\n\r\nBo'son to Captain Gow, the pirate. He had the reputation of being a good\r\nsailor but a bloodthirsty fellow. Was hanged at Wapping in June, 1725.\r\n\r\n\r\nBEME, FRANCIS.\r\n\r\nIn 1539 this Baltic pirate was cruising off Antwerp, waiting to waylay\r\nEnglish merchant vessels.\r\n\r\n\r\nBENDALL, GEORGE, or BENDEALL.\r\n\r\nA flourishing pirate, whose headquarters, in the early eighteenth century,\r\nwere in New Providence Island.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1717, King George offered a free pardon to all freebooters who\r\nwould come in and give themselves up. But the call of the brotherhood was\r\ntoo strong for a few of the \"old hands,\" and Bendall, amongst others, was\r\noff once again to carry on piracy around the Bahama and Virgin Islands.\r\nWithin a few years these last \"die-hards\" were all killed, drowned,\r\ncaught, or hanged.\r\n\r\n\r\nBENNETT, WILLIAM.\r\n\r\nAn English soldier, who deserted from Fort Loyal, Falmouth, Marne, in\r\n1689, and joined the pirate Pounds. Was sent to prison at Boston, where he\r\ndied.\r\n\r\n\r\nBILL, PHILIP.\r\n\r\nBelonged to the Island of St. Thomas.\r\n\r\nOne of Captain Roberts's crew. Hanged at the age of 27.\r\n\r\n\r\nBISHOP.\r\n\r\nAn Irishman. Chief mate to the pirate Captain Cobham.\r\n\r\n\r\nBISHOP, CAPTAIN.\r\n\r\nIn 1613, Bishop and a few other English seamen set up as pirates at\r\nMarmora on the Barbary Coast.\r\n\r\n\r\nBISHOP, WILLIAM.\r\n\r\nOne of Avery's crew. Hanged at Execution Dock in 1691.\r\n\r\n\r\nBLADS, WILLIAM.\r\n\r\nBorn in Rhode Island.\r\n\r\nOne of Captain Charles Harris's crew. Hanged at Newport on July 19th,\r\n1723. Age 28.\r\n\r\n\r\nBLAKE, BENJAMIN.\r\n\r\nA Boston boy, taken prisoner with Captain Pounds's crew at Tarpaulin Cove.\r\n\r\n\r\nBLAKE, JAMES.\r\n\r\nOne of Captain Teach's crew. Hanged in 1718 at Virginia.\r\n\r\n\r\nBLEWFIELD, CAPTAIN, or BLAUVELT.\r\n\r\nIn 1649 this Dutch pirate brought a prize into Newport, Rhode Island. In\r\n1663 was known to be living among the friendly Indians at Cape Gratia de\r\nDios on the Spanish Main. He commanded a barque carrying three guns and a\r\ncrew of fifty men. He was very active in the logwood cutting in Honduras.\r\nWhether the town and river of Bluefield take their name from this pirate\r\nis uncertain, but the captain must many a time have gone up the river into\r\nthe forests of Nicaragua on his logwood cutting raids.\r\n\r\n\r\nBLOT, CAPTAIN. French filibuster.\r\n\r\nIn 1684 was in command of _La Quagone_, ninety men, eight guns.\r\n\r\n\r\nBOLIVAR, LIEUTENANT.\r\n\r\nThis Portuguese pirate was first officer to Captain Jonnia. He was a\r\nstout, well-built man of swarthy complexion and keen, ferocious eyes, huge\r\nblack whiskers and beard, and a tremendously loud voice. He took the\r\nBoston schooner _Exertion_ at Twelve League Key on December 17th, 1821.\r\n\r\n\r\nBOND, CAPTAIN.\r\n\r\nOf Bristol.\r\n\r\nIn 1682 arrived at the Cape Verde Islands. Having procured leave to land\r\non Mayo Island, on the pretence of being an honest merchant in need of\r\nprovisions, particularly of beef and goats, Bond and his crew seized and\r\ncarried away some of the principal inhabitants. A year later John Cooke\r\nand Cowley arrived at Mayo in the _Revenge_, but were prevented by the\r\ninhabitants from landing owing to their recent treatment at the hands of\r\nBond.\r\n\r\n\r\nBONNET, MAJOR STEDE, _alias_ CAPTAIN THOMAS, _alias_ EDWARDS.\r\n\r\nThe history of this pirate is both interesting and unique. He was not\r\nbrought up to the seafaring life; in fact, before he took to piracy, he\r\nhad already retired from the Army, with the rank of Major. He owned\r\nsubstantial landed property in Barbadoes, lived in a fine house, was\r\nmarried, and much respected by the quality and gentry of that island. His\r\nturning pirate naturally greatly scandalized his neighbours, and they\r\nfound it difficult at first to imagine whatever had caused this sudden and\r\nextraordinary resolution, particularly in a man of his position in\r\nSociety. But when the cause at last came to be known, he was more pitied\r\nthan blamed, for it was understood that the Major's mind had become\r\nunbalanced owing to the unbridled nagging of Mrs. Bonnet. Referring to\r\nthis, the historian Captain Johnson writes as follows: \"He was afterwards\r\nrather pitty'd than condemned, by those that were acquainted with him,\r\nbelieving that this Humour of going a-pyrating proceeded from a Disorder\r\nin his Mind, which had been but too visible in him, some Time before this\r\nwicked Undertaking; and which is said to have been occasioned by some\r\nDiscomforts he found in a married State; be that as it will, the Major was\r\nbut ill qualified for the Business, as not understanding maritime\r\nAffairs.\" Whatever the cause of the Major's \"disorder of mind,\" the fact\r\nremains that at his own expense he fitted out a sloop armed with ten guns\r\nand a crew of seventy men. The fact that he honestly paid in cash for this\r\nship is highly suspicious of a deranged mind, since no other pirate, to\r\nthe writer's knowledge, ever showed such a nicety of feeling, but always\r\nstole the ship in which to embark \"on the account.\" The Major, to satisfy\r\nthe curious, gave out that he intended to trade between the islands, but\r\none night, without a word of farewell to Mrs. Bonnet, he sailed out of\r\nharbour in the _Revenge_, as he called his ship, and began to cruise off\r\nthe coast of Virginia. For a rank amateur, Bonnet met with wonderful\r\nsuccess, as is shown by a list of the prizes he took and plundered in this\r\nfirst period of his piracy:\r\n\r\nThe _Anne_, of Glasgow (Captain Montgomery).\r\n\r\nThe _Turbet_, of Barbadoes, which, after plundering, he burnt, as he did\r\nall prizes from Barbadoes.\r\n\r\nThe _Endeavour_ (Captain Scott).\r\n\r\nThe _Young_, of Leith.\r\n\r\nThe plunder out of these ships he sold at Gardiner Island, near New York.\r\n\r\nCruising next off the coast of Carolina, Bonnet took a brace of prizes,\r\nbut began to have trouble with his unruly crew, who, seeing that their\r\ncaptain knew nothing whatever of sea affairs, took advantage of the fact\r\nand commenced to get out of hand. Unluckily for Bonnet, he at this time\r\nmet with the famous Captain Teach, or Blackbeard, and the latter, quickly\r\nappreciating how matters stood, ordered the Major to come aboard his own\r\nship, while he put his lieutenant, Richards, to command Bonnet's vessel.\r\nThe poor Major was most depressed by this undignified change in his\r\naffairs, until Blackbeard lost his ship in Topsail Inlet, and finding\r\nhimself at a disadvantage, promptly surrendered to the King's proclamation\r\nand allowed Bonnet to reassume command of his own sloop. But Major Bonnet\r\nhad been suffering from qualms of conscience latterly, so he sailed to\r\nBath Town in North Carolina, where he, too, surrendered to the Governor\r\nand received his certificate of pardon. Almost at once news came of war\r\nbeing declared between England and France with Spain, so Bonnet hurried\r\nback to Topsail, and was granted permission to take back his sloop and\r\nsail her to St. Thomas's Island, to receive a commission as a privateer\r\nfrom the French Governor of that island. But in the meanwhile Teach had\r\nrobbed everything of any value out of Bonnet's ship, and had marooned\r\nseventeen of the crew on a sandy island, but these were rescued by the\r\nMajor before they died of starvation. Just as the ship was ready to sail,\r\na bumboat came alongside to sell apples and cider to the sloop's crew, and\r\nfrom these they got an interesting piece of news. They learnt that Teach,\r\nwith a crew of eighteen men, was at that moment lying at anchor in\r\nOcricock Inlet. The Major, longing to revenge the insult he had suffered\r\nfrom Blackbeard, and his crew remembering how he had left them to die on a\r\ndesert island, went off in search of Teach, but failed to find him. Stede\r\nBonnet having received his pardon in his own name, now called himself\r\nCaptain Thomas and again took to piracy, and evidently had benefited by\r\nhis apprenticeship with Blackbeard, for he was now most successful, taking\r\nmany prizes off the coast of Virginia, and later in Delaware Bay.\r\n\r\nBonnet now sailed in a larger ship, the _Royal James_, so named from\r\nfeelings of loyalty to the Crown. But she proved to be very leaky, and the\r\npirates had to take her to the mouth of Cape Fear River for repairs. News\r\nof this being carried to the Council of South Carolina, arrangements were\r\nmade to attempt to capture the pirate, and a Colonel William Rhet, at his\r\nown expense, fitted out two armed sloops, the _Henry_ (eight guns and\r\nseventy men) and the _Sea Nymph_ (eight guns and sixty men), both sailing\r\nunder the direct command of the gallant Colonel. On September 25th, 1718,\r\nthe sloops arrived at Cape Fear River, and there sure enough was the\r\n_Royal James_, with three sloops lying at anchor behind the bar. The\r\npirate tried to escape by sailing out, but was followed by the Colonel's\r\ntwo vessels until all three ran aground within gunshot of each other. A\r\nbrisk fight took place for five hours, when the Major struck his colours\r\nand surrendered. There was great public rejoicing in Charleston when, on\r\nOctober 3rd, Colonel Rhet sailed victoriously into the harbour with his\r\nprisoners. But next day Bonnet managed to escape out of prison and sailed\r\nto Swillivant's Island. The indefatigable Colonel Rhet again set out after\r\nthe Major, and again caught him and brought him back to Charleston.\r\n\r\nThe trial of Stede Bonnet and his crew began on October 28th, 1718, at\r\nCharleston, and continued till November 12th, the Judge being Nicholas\r\nTrot. Bonnet was found guilty and condemned to be hanged. Judge Trot made\r\na speech of overwhelming length to the condemned, full of Biblical\r\nquotations, to each of which the learned magistrate gave chapter and\r\nverse. In November, 1718, the gallant, if unfortunate, Major was hanged at\r\nWhite Point, Charleston.\r\n\r\nApart from the unusual cause for his turning pirate, Bonnet is interesting\r\nas being almost the only case known, otherwise than in books of romance,\r\nof a pirate making his prisoners walk the plank.\r\n\r\n\r\nBONNY, ANNE. Female pirate.\r\n\r\nAnne was born in County Cork, and her father was an Attorney-at-Law, who\r\npractised his profession in that city, her mother being lady's maid to the\r\nattorney's lawful wife.\r\n\r\nThe story of the events which led to the existence of Anne may be read in\r\nJohnson's \"History of the Pyrates,\" where it is recounted in a style quite\r\nsuggestive of Fielding. In spite of its sad deficiency in moral tone, the\r\nnarrative is highly diverting. But as this work is strictly confined to\r\nthe history of the pirates and not to the amorous intrigues of their\r\nforbears, we will skip these pre-natal episodes and come to the time when\r\nthe attorney, having lost a once flourishing legal practice, sailed from\r\nIreland to Carolina to seek a fortune there, taking his little daughter\r\nAnne with him. In new surroundings fortune favoured the attorney, and he\r\nsoon owned a rich plantation, and his daughter kept house for him.\r\n\r\nAnne was now grown up and a fine young woman, but had a \"fierce and\r\ncourageous temper,\" which more than once led her into scrapes, as, on one\r\noccasion, when in a sad fit of temper, she slew her English servant-maid\r\nwith a case-knife. But except for these occasional outbursts of passion\r\nshe was a good and dutiful girl. Her father now began to think of finding\r\na suitable young man to be a husband for Anne, which would not be hard to\r\ndo, since Anne, besides her good looks, was his heir and would be well\r\nprovided for by him. But Anne fell in love with a good-looking young\r\nsailor who arrived one day at Charleston, and, knowing her father would\r\nnever consent to such a match, the lovers were secretly married, in the\r\nexpectation that, the deed being done, the father would soon become\r\nreconciled to it. But on the contrary, the attorney, on being told the\r\nnews, turned his daughter out of doors and would have nothing more to do\r\nwith either of them. The bridegroom, finding his heiress worth not a\r\ngroat, did what other sailors have done before and since, and slipped away\r\nto sea without so much as saying good-bye to his bride. But a more gallant\r\nlover soon hove in sight, the handsome, rich, dare-devil pirate, Captain\r\nJohn Rackam, known up and down the coast as \"Calico Jack.\" Jack's methods\r\nof courting and taking a ship were similar--no time wasted, straight up\r\nalongside, every gun brought to play, and the prize seized. Anne was soon\r\nswept off her feet by her picturesque and impetuous lover, and consented\r\nto go to sea with him in his ship, but disguised herself in sailor's\r\nclothes before going on board. The lovers sailed together on a piratical\r\nhoneymoon until certain news being conveyed to Captain Rackam by his\r\nbride, he sailed to Cuba and put Anne ashore at a small cove, where he had\r\na house and also friends, who he knew would take good care of her. But\r\nbefore long Anne was back in the pirate ship, as active as any of her male\r\nshipmates with cutlass and marlinspike, always one of the leaders in\r\nboarding a prize.\r\n\r\nHowever, the day of retribution was at hand. While cruising near Jamaica\r\nin October, 1720, the pirates were surprised by the sudden arrival of an\r\narmed sloop, which had been sent out by the Governor of that island for\r\nthe express purpose of capturing Rackam and his crew. A fight followed, in\r\nwhich the pirates behaved in a most cowardly way, and were soon driven\r\nbelow decks, all but Anne Bonny and another woman pirate, Mary Read, who\r\nfought gallantly till taken prisoners, all the while flaunting their male\r\ncompanions on their cowardly conduct. The prisoners were carried to\r\nJamaica and tried for piracy at St. Jago de la Vega, and convicted on\r\nNovember 28th, 1720. Anne pleaded to have her execution postponed for\r\nreasons of her condition of health, and this was allowed, and she never\r\nappears to have been hanged, though what her ultimate fate was is unknown.\r\nOn the day that her lover Rackam was hanged he obtained, by special\r\nfavour, permission to see Anne, but must have derived little comfort from\r\nthe farewell interview, for all he got in the way of sympathy from his\r\nlady love were these words--that \"she was sorry to see him there, but if\r\nhe had fought like a Man, he need not have been hang'd like a Dog.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nBOON, JOHN.\r\n\r\nMember of the Council of Carolina under Governor Colleton, and expelled\r\nfrom it \"for holding correspondence with pirates,\" 1687.\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOTH, SAMUEL.\r\n\r\nOf Charleston, Carolina.\r\n\r\nOne of Major Bonnet's crew. Hanged at Charleston, South Carolina, in 1718.\r\n\r\n\r\nBOURNANO, CAPTAIN, or DE BERNANOS.\r\n\r\nIn 1679 this famous French filibuster commanded a ship of ninety tons,\r\narmed with six guns, and manned by a crew of eighty-six French sailors.\r\nJoined Captain Bartholomew Sharp when he was preparing his expedition to\r\nassault the town of Santa Maria. Bournano was a useful ally, as he was\r\nmuch liked by the Darien Indians, but his crew quarrelled with the English\r\nbuccaneers, and they left Sharp's company. In the year 1684, Bournano,\r\nknown by then as Le Sieur de Bernanos, commanded a ship, _La Schite_,\r\ncarrying a crew of sixty men and armed with eight guns.\r\n\r\n\r\nLA BOUSE, CAPTAIN OLIVER, or DE LA BOUCHE.\r\n\r\nFrench pirate.\r\n\r\nWhen Captain Howel Davis had taken and sacked the fort at Gambia and with\r\nhis crew was spending a day in revelry, a ship was reported, bearing down\r\non them in full sail. The pirates prepared to fight her, when she ran up\r\nthe Black Flag and proved to be a French pirate ship of fourteen guns and\r\nsixty-four hands, half French and half negroes, commanded by Captain La\r\nBouse. A great many civilities passed between the two captains, and they\r\nagreed to sail down the coast together. Arriving at Sierra Leone, they\r\nfound a tall ship lying at anchor. This ship they attacked, firing a\r\nbroadside, when she also ran up the Black Flag, being the vessel of the\r\nnotorious Captain Cocklyn. For the next two days the three captains and\r\ntheir crews \"spent improving their acquaintance and friendship,\" which was\r\nthe pirate expression for getting gloriously drunk. On the third day they\r\nattacked and took the African Company's Fort. Shortly afterwards the three\r\ncaptains quarrelled, and each went his own way. In 1718 La Bouse was at\r\nNew Providence Island. In 1720 this pirate commanded the _Indian Queen_,\r\n250 tons, armed with twenty-eight guns, and a crew of ninety men. Sailing\r\nfrom the Guinea Coast to the East Indies, de la Bouche lost his ship on\r\nthe Island of Mayotta, near Madagascar.\r\n\r\nThe captain and forty men set about building a new vessel, while the\r\nremainder went off in canoes to join Captain England's pirates at Johanna.\r\n\r\n\r\nBOWEN.\r\n\r\nA Bristol man. In 1537, when the Breton pirates were becoming very daring\r\nalong the south coast of England and Wales, Bowen contrived to capture\r\nfourteen of these robbers, who had landed near Tenby, and had them put in\r\nprison.\r\n\r\n\r\nBOWEN, CAPTAIN JOHN.\r\n\r\nThe practice of this South Sea pirate extended from Madagascar to Bengal.\r\nHe commanded a good ship, the _Speaker_, a French vessel, owned by an\r\nEnglish company interested in the slave trade, which Bowen had captured by\r\na cunning ruse. He afterwards lost his ship off Mauritius, but was well\r\ntreated by the Dutch Governor, who supplied doctors, medicine, and food to\r\nthe shipwrecked pirates. After three months' hospitality on the island,\r\nBowen procured a sloop, and in March, 1701, sailed for Madagascar. As a\r\nparting friendly gift to the Governor, he gave him 2,500 pieces of eight\r\nand the wreck of the _Speaker_, with all the guns and stores. On arriving\r\nat Madagascar, Bowen erected a fort and built a town. Shortly after this a\r\nship, the _Speedy Return_, and a brigantine were so very thoughtless as to\r\nput into the port, and paid for this thoughtlessness by being promptly\r\nseized by Bowen. With these two vessels Bowen and his merry men went\r\n\"a-pyrating\" again, and with great success, for in a short time they had\r\ngathered together over a million dollars in coin, as well as vast\r\nquantities of valuable merchandise. The pirates then, most wisely,\r\nconsidering that they had succeeded well enough, settled down amongst\r\ntheir Dutch friends in the Island of Mauritius to a quiet and comfortable\r\nlife on shore.\r\n\r\n\r\nBOWMAN, WILLIAM.\r\n\r\nA seaman; one of the party which crossed the Isthmus of Darien on foot\r\nwith Dampier in 1681. Wafer records that Bowman, \"a weakly Man, a Taylor\r\nby trade,\" slipped while crossing a swollen river, and was carried off by\r\nthe swift current, and nearly drowned by the weight of a satchel he\r\ncarried containing 400 pieces of eight.\r\n\r\n\r\nBOYD, ROBERT.\r\n\r\nOf Bath Town, North Carolina.\r\n\r\nSailed with Major Stede Bonnet in the _Royal James_. Hanged on November\r\n8th, 1718, at Charleston.\r\n\r\n\r\nBOYZA.\r\n\r\nA Columbian.\r\n\r\nOne of Captain Gilbert's crew in the _Panda_. Hanged at Boston in June,\r\n1835.\r\n\r\n\r\nBRADISH, CAPTAIN JOSEPH.\r\n\r\nA notorious pirate. Born at Cambridge, Massachusetts, on November 28th,\r\n1672. In March, 1689, was in London out of a berth, and shipped as mate in\r\nthe hake-boat _Adventure_, bound for Borneo on an interloping trade.\r\n\r\nIn September, 1698, when most of the officers and passengers were ashore\r\nat the Island of Polonais, Bradish and the crew cut the cable and ran away\r\nwith the ship. The crew shared the money which was found in the\r\nbread-room, and which filled nine chests, amounting to about 3,700 Spanish\r\ndollars.\r\n\r\nBradish sailed the _Adventure_ to Long Island, arriving there on March\r\n19th, 1699. After leaving their money and jewels on Nassau Island, they\r\nsank their ship. Most of the crew bought horses at the neighbouring\r\nfarmhouses and disappeared. Bradish and a few others were rash enough to\r\ngo to Massachusetts, where they were promptly arrested and placed in the\r\nBoston Gaol. But the gaolkeeper, one Caleb Ray, was a relation of Bradish,\r\nand allowed him to escape. An offer of a reward of £200 brought the\r\nescaped prisoner back, and he sailed in irons on H.M.S. _Advice_, with\r\nKidd and other pirates, to England, and was hanged in chains in London at\r\nHope Dock in 1700.\r\n\r\n\r\nBRADLEY, GEORGE.\r\n\r\nMaster of Captain Fenn's ship, the _Morning Star_, wrecked on the Grand\r\nCaymans in August, 1722. The crew got ashore on an island and hid in the\r\nwoods. Bradley and the other pirates afterwards surrendered themselves to\r\nan English sloop, and were carried to Bermuda. Bradley escaped to England,\r\nand was last heard of at Bristol.\r\n\r\n\r\nBREAKES, CAPTAIN HIRAM.\r\n\r\nThis Dutch pirate was the second son of a well-to-do councillor of the\r\nIsland of Saba in the West Indies. Hiram was appointed in the year 1764 to\r\na ship which traded between that island and Amsterdam. In the latter port,\r\nHiram, who was now 19 years of age and a handsome fellow standing over six\r\nfeet in height, fell in love with a certain Mrs. Snyde.\r\n\r\nGetting command of a small ship that traded between Schiedam, in Holland,\r\nand Lisbon, Breakes for some time sailed between these ports. Returning to\r\nAmsterdam, he and Mrs. Snyde murdered that lady's husband, but at the\r\ntrial managed to get acquitted.\r\n\r\nBreakes's next exploit was to steal his employer's ship and cargo and go\r\nout as a pirate, naming his vessel the _Adventure_. His first exploit was\r\na daring one. Sailing into Vigo Harbour in full view of the forts, he\r\nseized a vessel, the _Acapulco_, lately come from Valparaiso, and took her\r\noff. On plundering her they found 200,000 small bars of gold, each about\r\nthe size of a man's finger. The captain and crew of this Chilian vessel\r\nwere all murdered. Breakes preferred the _Acapulco_ to his own ship, so he\r\nfitted her up and sailed in her to the Mediterranean.\r\n\r\nBreakes was one of the religious variety of pirate, for after six days of\r\nrobbing and throat-slitting he would order his crew to clean themselves on\r\nthe Sabbath and gather on the quarter-deck, where he would read prayers to\r\nthem and would often preach a sermon \"after the Lutheran style,\" thus\r\nfortifying the brave fellows for another week of toil and bloodshed.\r\n\r\nGifted with unlimited boldness, Breakes called in at Gibraltar and\r\nrequested the Governor to grant him a British privateer's commission,\r\nwhich the Governor did \"for a consideration.\" Sailing in the neighbourhood\r\nof the Balearic Islands, he took a few ships, when one day, spying a\r\nnunnery by the sea-shore in Minorca, he proposed to his crew that they\r\nshould fit themselves out with a wife apiece.\r\n\r\nThis generous offer was eagerly accepted, and the crew, headed by Captain\r\nBreakes, marched up to the nunnery unopposed, and were welcomed at the\r\ndoor by the lady abbess. Having entered the peaceful cloister, each pirate\r\nchose a nun and marched back to the ship with their spoils. Soon after\r\nthis Breakes decided to retire from piracy, and returned to Amsterdam to\r\nclaim Mrs. Snyde. But he found that she had but lately been hanged for\r\npoisoning her little son, of which the pirate was father. This tragedy so\r\npreyed upon the mind of Captain Breakes that he turned \"melancholy mad\"\r\nand drowned himself in one of the many dykes with which that city abounds.\r\n\r\n\r\nBRECK, JOHN.\r\n\r\nOne of the crew of the brigantine _Charles_ (Captain John Quelch). Tried\r\nfor piracy at Boston in 1704.\r\n\r\n\r\nBREHA, CAPTAIN, _alias_ LANDRESSON.\r\n\r\n\r\nBRENNINGHAM, CAPTAIN.\r\n\r\nOf Jamaica and Tortuga.\r\n\r\nIn 1663 commanded a frigate of six guns and seventy men.\r\n\r\n\r\nBRIERLY, JOHN, _alias_ TIMBERHEAD.\r\n\r\nOf Bath Town in North Carolina.\r\n\r\nOne of the crew of the _Royal James_. Hanged at Charleston in November,\r\n1718.\r\n\r\n\r\nBRIGHT, JOHN.\r\n\r\nOf St. Margaret's, Westminster.\r\n\r\nOne of the crew of Captain Charles Harris. Hanged at Newport, Rhode\r\nIsland, in July, 1723, at the age of 25.\r\n\r\n\r\nBRINKLEY, JAMES.\r\n\r\nOf Suffolk, England.\r\n\r\nOne of Captain Charles Harris's crew. Hanged for piracy at Newport, Rhode\r\nIsland, on July 19th, 1723. Age 28.\r\n\r\n\r\nBRODLEY, CAPTAIN JOSEPH, or BRADLEY, sometimes called\r\n\"Lieutenant-Colonel.\" \"An ancient and expert pirate.\"\r\n\r\nAppointed Vice-Admiral by Morgan in his expedition up the Chagre River. He\r\nwas a tough old pirate, and had proved himself a terror to the Spaniards,\r\nparticularly when Mansvelt took the Isle of St. Catharine. In 1676 Brodley\r\nwas sent by Morgan to capture the Castle of Chagre, a very strongly\r\ngarrisoned fort. All day the pirates kept up a furious attack, but were\r\ndriven back. At last, when it seemed impossible for the pirates ever to\r\nsucceed in entering the castle, a remarkable accident happened which\r\naltered the whole issue. One of the pirates was wounded by an arrow in his\r\nback, which pierced his body and came out the opposite side. This he\r\ninstantly pulled out at the side of his breast; then, taking a little\r\ncotton, he wound it about the arrow, and, putting it into his musket, he\r\nshot it back into the castle. The cotton, kindled by the powder, set fire\r\nto several houses within the castle, which, being thatched with\r\npalm-leaves, took fire very easily. This fire at last reached the powder\r\nmagazine, and a great explosion occurred. Owing to this accident of the\r\narrow the pirates were eventually able to take the Castle of Chagre. This\r\nwas one of the finest and bravest defences ever made by the Spaniards. Out\r\nof 314 Spanish soldiers in the castle, only thirty survived, all the rest,\r\nincluding the Governor, being killed. Brodley was himself severely wounded\r\nin this action and died as a consequence ten days later.\r\n\r\n\r\nBROOKS, JOSEPH (senior).\r\n\r\nOne of Blackbeard's crew in the _Queen Ann's Revenge_. Killed on November\r\n22nd, 1718, at North Carolina.\r\n\r\n\r\nBROOKS, JOSEPH (junior).\r\n\r\nOne of Blackbeard's crew in the _Queen Ann's Revenge_. Taken prisoner by\r\nLieutenant Maynard on November 22nd, 1718. Carried to Virginia, where he\r\nwas tried and hanged.\r\n\r\n\r\nBROWN, CAPTAIN.\r\n\r\nA notorious latter-day pirate, who \"worked\" the east coast of Central\r\nAmerica in the early part of the nineteenth century.\r\n\r\n\r\nBROWN, CAPTAIN.\r\n\r\nOn July 24th, 1702, sailed from Jamaica in command of the _Blessing_--ten\r\nguns and crew of seventy-nine men, with the famous Edward Davis on\r\nboard--to attack the town of Tolu on the Spanish Main. The town was taken\r\nand plundered, but Brown was killed, being shot through the head.\r\n\r\n\r\nBROWN, CAPTAIN NICHOLAS.\r\n\r\nSurrendered to the King's pardon for pirates at New Providence, Bahamas,\r\nin 1718. Soon afterwards he surrendered to the Spanish Governor of Cuba,\r\nembraced the Catholic faith, and turned pirate once more; and was very\r\nactive in attacking English ships off the Island of Jamaica.\r\n\r\n\r\nBROWN, JOHN.\r\n\r\nOf Durham, England.\r\n\r\nOne of Captain Charles Harris's crew. Hanged at the age of 29 years at\r\nNewport, Rhode Island, in 1723.\r\n\r\n\r\nBROWN, JOHN.\r\n\r\nOf Liverpool.\r\n\r\nOne of Captain Harris's crew. Found guilty of piracy at Newport, Rhode\r\nIsland, in 1723, but recommended to the King's favour, perhaps in view of\r\nhis age, being but 17 years old.\r\n\r\n\r\nBROWNE, CAPTAIN JAMES.\r\n\r\nA Scotchman.\r\n\r\nIn 1677, when in command of a mixed crew of English, Dutch, and French\r\npirates, he took a Dutch ship trading in negroes off the coast of\r\nCartagena. The Dutch captain and several of his crew were killed, while\r\nthe cargo of 150 negroes was landed in a remote bay on the coast of\r\nJamaica.\r\n\r\nLord Vaughan sent a frigate, which captured about a hundred of the negro\r\nslaves and also Browne and eight of his pirate crew. The captain and crew\r\nwere tried for piracy and condemned. The crew were pardoned, but Browne\r\nwas ordered to be executed. The captain appealed to the Assembly to have\r\nthe benefit of the Act of Privateers, and the House of Assembly twice sent\r\na committee to the Governor to beg a reprieve. Lord Vaughan refused this\r\nand ordered the immediate execution of Browne. Half an hour after the\r\nhanging the provost-marshal appeared with an order, signed by the Speaker,\r\nto stop the execution.\r\n\r\n\r\nBROWNE, EDWARD.\r\n\r\nOf York River, Virginia.\r\n\r\nOne of Captain Pounds's crew. Wounded at Tarpaulin Cove in 1689.\r\n\r\n\r\nBROWNE, JOHN, _alias_ MAMME.\r\n\r\nAn English sailor who joined the Barbary pirates at Algiers and turned\r\nMohammedan. Taken in the _Exchange_ in 1622 and carried a prisoner to\r\nPlymouth.\r\n\r\n\r\nBROWNE, RICHARD. Surgeon.\r\n\r\nSurgeon-General in Morgan's fleet which carried the buccaneers to the\r\nSpanish Main. He wrote an account of the disastrous explosion on board the\r\n_Oxford_ during a banquet given to Morgan and the buccaneer commanders on\r\nJanuary 2nd, 1669, off Cow Island to the south of Hispaniola, at which the\r\ndetails were being discussed for an attack on Cartagena.\r\n\r\nBrowne writes: \"I was eating my dinner with the rest when the mainmasts\r\nblew out and fell upon Captains Aylett and Bigford and others and knocked\r\nthem on the head. I saved myself by getting astride the mizzenmast.\" Only\r\nMorgan and those who sat on his side of the dinner-table were saved.\r\n\r\nBrowne, who certainly was not biased towards Morgan in his accounts of his\r\nexploits, is one of the few narrators who gives the buccaneer Admiral\r\ncredit for moderation towards his prisoners, particularly women.\r\n\r\n\r\nBUCK, ELEAZER.\r\n\r\nOne of Captain Pounds's crew. Tried at Boston in 1689 for piracy and found\r\nguilty, but pardoned on payment of a fine of twenty marks.\r\n\r\n\r\nBUCKENHAM, CAPTAIN.\r\n\r\nIn 1679 sailed from England to the West Indies. He was taken by the\r\nSpaniards off Campeachy and carried to Mexico. A seaman, Russel, also a\r\nprisoner there, and who escaped afterwards, reported to Lionel Wafer that\r\nhe last saw Captain Buckenham with a log chained to his leg and a basket\r\non his back, crying bread about the streets of the city of Mexico for his\r\nmaster, a baker.\r\n\r\n\r\nBULL, CAPTAIN DIXEY.\r\n\r\nBorn in London of a respectable family, and in 1631 went to Boston, where\r\nhe received a grant of land at York on the coast of Maine. Became a\r\n\"trader for bever\" in New England. In June, 1632, while in Penobscot Bay,\r\na French pinnace arrived and seized his shallop and stock of \"coats,\r\nruggs, blanketts, bisketts, etc.\" Annoyed by this high-handed behaviour,\r\nBull collected together a small crew and turned pirate, thus being the\r\nvery first pirate on the New England coast. Bull took several small\r\nvessels, and was not caught by the authorities, who sent out small armed\r\nsloops to search for him, and nothing more was heard of this pioneer\r\npirate after 1633, although rumour said that he had reached England in\r\nsafety.\r\n\r\n\r\nBULL, MR.\r\n\r\nA member of the crew of Coxon's canoe, he was killed in the famous attack\r\nby the buccaneers on the Spanish Fleet off Panama in 1680.\r\n\r\n\r\nBULLOCK. Surgeon.\r\n\r\nOne of the crew at the second disastrous attack by Captain Sharp on the\r\ntown of Arica, when the buccaneers were driven out of the town. All\r\nescaped who could, except the surgeons, who, in a most unprofessional way,\r\nhad been indulging somewhat freely in the wines of the country during the\r\nbattle, and consequently were in no condition to take their places with\r\nthe retreating force. The surgeons, after being taken prisoner, were\r\npersuaded to disclose to the Spaniards the prearranged signals by smoke\r\nfrom two fires, which was to be given in case of a successful taking of\r\nthe town, to bring up the boats that were hiding on the shore, ready to\r\ntake the buccaneers back to their ships. Fortunately the buccaneers on the\r\nshore arrived just as the canoes were getting under way, otherwise the\r\nwhole remnant of them would have perished. The only one of these\r\ndisreputable surgeons whose name we know is Dr. Bullock. Some months\r\nafterwards it was ascertained, through a prisoner, that the Spaniards\r\n\"civilly entertained these surgeons, more especially the women.\" Surgeons,\r\neven such surgeons as these, were considered to be valuable in those days\r\nin the out-of-the-way Spanish colonies.\r\n\r\n\r\nBUNCE, CHARLES.\r\n\r\nBorn at Exeter; died at the age of 26.\r\n\r\nTaken by Captain Roberts out of a Dutch galley in 1721, he joined the\r\npirates, to be eventually hanged in 1722. He made a moving speech from the\r\ngallows, \"disclaiming against the guilded Bates of Power, Liberty, and\r\nWealth that had ensnared him amongst the pirates,\" earnestly exhorting the\r\nspectators to remember his youth, and ending by declaring that \"he stood\r\nthere as a beacon upon a Rock\" (the gallows standing on one) \"to warn\r\nerring Marriners of Danger.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nBURDER, WILLIAM.\r\n\r\nMayor of Dover.\r\n\r\nIt may seem strange to accuse the mayor of so important a seaport as Dover\r\nof being a pirate, but it is difficult to see how William Burder is to\r\nescape the accusation when we learn that in the year 1563 he captured 600\r\nFrench vessels and a large number of neutral craft, which he plundered,\r\nand also no fewer than sixty-one Spanish ships, to the very natural\r\nannoyance of the King of Spain, whose country was at this time at peace\r\nwith England.\r\n\r\n\r\nBURGESS, CAPTAIN SAMUEL SOUTH.\r\n\r\nBorn and bred in New York, he was a man of good education, and began his\r\ncareer on a privateer in the West Indies. Later on he was sent by a Mr.\r\nPhilips, owner and shipbuilder, to trade with the pirates in Madagascar.\r\nThis business Burgess augmented with a little piracy on his own account,\r\nand after taking several prizes he returned to the West Indies, where he\r\ndisposed of his loot. He then proceeded to New York, and, purposely\r\nwrecking his vessel at Sandy Hook, landed in the guise of an honest\r\nshipwrecked mariner.\r\n\r\nBurgess settled down for a time to a well-earned rest, and married a\r\nrelative of his employer, Mr. Philips.\r\n\r\nPhilips sent him on two further voyages, both of which were run on\r\nperfectly honest lines, and were most successful both to owner and\r\ncaptain. But a later voyage had an unhappy ending. After successfully\r\ntrading with the pirates in Madagascar, Burgess was returning home,\r\ncarrying several pirates as passengers, who were returning to settle in\r\nAmerica, having made their fortunes. The ship was captured off the Cape of\r\nGood Hope by an East Indiaman, and taken to Madras. Here the captain and\r\npassengers were put in irons and sent to England to be tried. The case\r\nagainst Burgess fell through, and he was liberated. Instead of at once\r\ngetting away, he loitered about London until one unlucky day he ran across\r\nan old pirate associate called Culliford, on whose evidence Burgess was\r\nagain arrested, tried, and condemned to death, but pardoned at the last\r\nmoment by the Queen, through the intercession of the Bishop of London.\r\nAfter a while he procured the post of mate in the _Neptune_, a Scotch\r\nvessel, which was to go to Madagascar to trade liquors with the pirates\r\nwho had their headquarters in that delectable island. On arrival at\r\nMadagascar a sudden hurricane swept down, dismasted the _Neptune_, and\r\nsank two pirate ships. The chief pirate, Halsey, as usual, proved himself\r\na man of resource. Seeing that without a ship his activities were severely\r\nrestricted, he promptly, with the help of his faithful and willing crew,\r\nseized the _Neptune_, this satisfactory state of affairs being largely\r\nfacilitated by the knowledge that the mate, Burgess, was all ripe to go on\r\nthe main chance once more. The first venture of this newly formed crew was\r\nmost successful, as they seized a ship, the _Greyhound_, which lay in the\r\nbay, the owners of which had but the previous day bought--and paid for--a\r\nvaluable loading of merchandise from the pirates. This was now taken back\r\nby the pirates, who, having refitted the _Neptune_, set forth seeking\r\nfresh adventures and prizes. The further history of Burgess is one of\r\nconstant change and disappointment.\r\n\r\nWhile serving under a Captain North, he was accused of betraying some of\r\nhis associates, and was robbed of all his hard-earned savings. For several\r\nyears after this he lived ashore at a place in Madagascar called\r\nMethalage, until captured by some Dutch rovers, who soon after were\r\nthemselves taken by French pirates. Burgess, with his former Dutch\r\ncaptain, was put ashore at Johanna, where, under the former's expert\r\nknowledge, a ship was built and sailed successfully to Youngoul, where\r\nBurgess got a post as third mate on a ship bound to the West Indies.\r\nBefore sailing, Burgess was sent, on account of his knowledge of the\r\nlanguage, as ambassador to the local King. Burgess, unfortunately for\r\nhimself, had in the past said some rather unkind things about this\r\nparticular ruler, and the offended monarch, in revenge, gave Burgess some\r\npoisoned liquor to drink, which quickly brought to an end an active if\r\nchequered career.\r\n\r\n\r\nBURGESS, CAPTAIN THOMAS.\r\n\r\nOne of the pirates of the Bahama Islands who surrendered to King George in\r\n1718 and received the royal pardon. He was afterwards drowned at sea.\r\n\r\n\r\nBURK, CAPTAIN.\r\n\r\nAn Irishman, who committed many piracies on the coast of Newfoundland.\r\nDrowned in the Atlantic during a hurricane in 1699.\r\n\r\n\r\nCACHEMARÉE, CAPTAIN. French filibuster.\r\n\r\nCommanded the _St. Joseph_, of six guns and a crew of seventy men. In 1684\r\nhad his headquarters at San Domingo.\r\n\r\n\r\nCÆSAR.\r\n\r\nA negro. One of Teach's crew hanged at Virginia in 1718. Cæsar, who was\r\nmuch liked and trusted by Blackbeard, had orders from him to blow up the\r\n_Queen Ann's Revenge_ by dropping a lighted match into the powder magazine\r\nin case the ship was taken by Lieutenant Maynard. Cæsar attempted to carry\r\nout his instructions, but was prevented from doing so by two of the\r\nsurrendered pirates.\r\n\r\n\r\nCÆSAR, CAPTAIN.\r\n\r\nOne of Gasparilla's gang of pirates who hunted in the Gulf of Mexico. His\r\nheadquarters were on Sanibel Island.\r\n\r\n\r\nCALLES, CAPTAIN JOHN, or CALLIS.\r\n\r\nA notorious Elizabethan pirate, whose activities were concentrated on the\r\ncoast of Wales.\r\n\r\nWe quote Captain John Smith, the founder of Virginia, who writes: \"This\r\nAncient pirate Callis, who most refreshed himselfe upon the Coast of\r\nWales, who grew famous, till Queene Elizabeth of Blessed Memory, hanged\r\nhim at Wapping.\"\r\n\r\nCalles did not die on the gallows without an attempt at getting let off.\r\nHe wrote a long and ingenious letter to Lord Walsyngham, bewailing his\r\nformer wicked life and promising, if spared, to assist in ridding the\r\ncoast of pirates by giving particulars of \"their roads, haunts, creeks,\r\nand maintainers.\" One of the chief of these \"maintainers,\" or receivers of\r\nstolen property, was Lord O'Sullivan, or the Sulivan Bere of Berehaven.\r\nIn spite of a long and very plausible plea for pity, this \"ancient and\r\nwicked pyrate\" met his fate on the gibbet at Wapping.\r\n\r\n\r\nCAMMOCK, WILLIAM.\r\n\r\nA seaman under Captain Bartholomew Sharp. He died at sea on December 14th,\r\n1679, off the coast of Chile. \"His disease was occasioned by a sunfit,\r\ngained by too much drinking on shore at La Serena; which produced in him a\r\n_celenture_, or malignant fever and a hiccough.\" He was buried at sea with\r\nthe usual honours of \"three French vollies.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nCANDOR, RALPH.\r\n\r\nTried for piracy with the rest of Captain Lowther's crew at St. Kitts in\r\nMarch, 1723, and acquitted.\r\n\r\n\r\nCANNIS, _alias_ CANNIS MARCY.\r\n\r\nA Dutch pirate who acted as interpreter to Captain Bartholomew Sharp's\r\nSouth Sea Expedition. Captain Cox and Basil Ringmore took him with them\r\nafter the sacking of Hilo in 1679, to come to terms with the Spanish\r\ncavalry over the ransoming of a sugar mill. On Friday, May 27th, 1680,\r\nwhile ashore with a watering party in the Gulf of Nicoya, the interpreter,\r\nhaving had, no doubt, his fill of buccaneering, ran away.\r\n\r\n\r\nCARACCIOLI, SIGNOR, _alias_ D'AUBIGNY.\r\n\r\nAn Italian renegade priest, who became an atheist, Socialist, and\r\nrevolutionist, and was living at Naples when Captain Fourbin arrived there\r\nin the French man-of-war _Victoire_.\r\n\r\nCaraccioli met and made great friends with a young French apprentice in\r\nthe ship, called Misson, and a place was found for him on board. The\r\nex-priest proved himself to be a brave man in several engagements with\r\nthe Moors and with an English warship, and was quickly promoted to be a\r\npetty officer.\r\n\r\nCaraccioli, by his eloquence, soon converted most of the crew to believe\r\nin his theories, and when Captain Fourbin was killed in an action off\r\nMartinique with an English ship, Misson took command and appointed the\r\nItalian to be his Lieutenant, and continued to fight the English ship to a\r\nfinish. The victorious crew then elected Misson to be their captain, and\r\ndecided to \"bid defiance to all nations\" and to settle on some\r\nout-of-the-way island. Capturing another English ship off the Cape of Good\r\nHope, Caraccioli was put in command of her, and the whole of the English\r\ncrew voluntarily joined the pirates, and sailed to Madagascar. Here they\r\nsettled, and the Italian married the daughter of a black Island King; an\r\nideal republic was formed, and our hero was appointed Secretary of State.\r\n\r\nEventually Caraccioli died fighting during a sudden attack made on the\r\nsettlement by a neighbouring tribe.\r\n\r\n\r\nCARMAN, THOMAS.\r\n\r\nOf Maidstone in Kent.\r\n\r\nHanged at Charleston in 1718 with the rest of Major Bonnet's crew.\r\n\r\n\r\nCARNES, JOHN.\r\n\r\nOne of Blackbeard's crew. Hanged at Virginia in 1718.\r\n\r\n\r\nCARR, JOHN.\r\n\r\nA Massachusetts pirate, one of Hore's crew, who was hiding in Rhode Island\r\nin 1699.\r\n\r\n\r\nCARTER, DENNIS.\r\n\r\nTried for piracy in June, 1704, at the Star Tavern in Boston. One of John\r\nQuelch's crew.\r\n\r\n\r\nCARTER, JOHN.\r\n\r\nCaptured by Major Sewall in the _Larimore_ galley, and brought into Salem.\r\nOne of Captain Quelch's crew. Tried at Boston in 1704.\r\n\r\n\r\nCASTILLO.\r\n\r\nA Columbian sailor in the schooner _Panda_. Hanged for piracy at Boston on\r\nJune 11th, 1835.\r\n\r\n\r\nLA CATA.\r\n\r\nA most blood-thirsty pirate and one of the last of the West Indian gangs.\r\n\r\nIn 1824, when La Cata was cruising off the Isle of Pines, his ship was\r\nattacked by an English cutter only half his size. After a furious fight\r\nthe cutter was victorious, and returned in triumph to Jamaica with the\r\nthree survivors of the pirates as prisoners. One of these was found out at\r\nthe trial to be La Cata himself. Hanged at Kingston, Jamaica.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHANDLER, HENRY, _alias_ RAMMETHAM RISE.\r\n\r\nBorn in Devonshire, his father kept a chandler's shop in Southwark. An\r\nEnglish _renegado_ at Algiers, who had turned Mohammedan and had become an\r\noverseer in the pirates' shipyards. He was a man of some authority amongst\r\nthe Moors, and in 1621 he appointed a slave called Goodale to become\r\nmaster of one of the pirate ships, the _Exchange_, in which one Rawlins\r\nalso sailed. Owing to the courage and ingenuity of the latter, the\r\nEuropean slaves afterwards seized the ship and brought her into Plymouth;\r\nChandler being thrown into gaol and afterwards hanged.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHEESMAN, EDWARD.\r\n\r\nTaken prisoner out of the _Dolphin_, on the Banks of Newfoundland, by the\r\nPirate Phillips in 1724. With the help of a fisherman called Fillmore, he\r\nkilled Phillips and ten other pirates and brought the ship into Boston\r\nHarbour.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHEVALLE, DANIEL.\r\n\r\nOne of Captain John Quelch's crew. Tried for piracy at Boston in 1704.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHILD, THOMAS.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1723, at the age of 15, he was tried for piracy at Newport,\r\nRhode Island. This child must have seen scores of cold-blooded murders\r\ncommitted while he sailed with Low and Harris. Found to be not guilty.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHRISTIAN, CAPTAIN.\r\n\r\nIn 1702 the town of Tolu was sacked by Captain Brown of the _Blessing_.\r\nBrown was killed, and Christian was elected to be captain in his stead.\r\nDavis tells us that \"Christian was an old experienced soldier and\r\nprivateer, very brave and just in all his actions.\" He had lived for a\r\nlong while amongst the Darien Indians, with whom he was on very friendly\r\nterms.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHULY, DANIEL.\r\n\r\nTried for piracy at Boston, Massachusetts, in 1706.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHURCH, CHARLES.\r\n\r\nOf St. Margaret's, Westminster.\r\n\r\nOne of Captain Charles Harris's crew. Hanged on July 19th, 1723, at\r\nNewport, Rhode Island. Age\r\n\r\n\r\nCHURCH, EDWARD.\r\n\r\nIn 1830 he served in the brig _Vineyard_, from New Orleans to\r\nPhiladelphia. Took part in the mutiny which was planned by the notorious\r\npirate Charles Gibbs.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHURCH, WILLIAM.\r\n\r\nOf the _Gertrwycht_ of Holland.\r\n\r\nAt the trial at West Africa in 1722 of the crew of Bartholomew Roberts's,\r\nfour of the prisoners--W. Church, Phil. Haak, James White, and Nicholas\r\nBrattle--were proved to have \"served as Musick on board the _Royal\r\nFortune_, being taken out of several merchant ships, having had an uneasy\r\nlife of it, having sometimes their Fiddles, and often their Heads broke,\r\nonly for excusing themselves, as saying they were tired, when any Fellow\r\ntook it in his Head to demand a Tune.\" Acquitted.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHURCHILL, JOHN.\r\n\r\nOne of Captain George Lowther's crew. Captured by the _Eagle_ sloop at the\r\nIsland of Blanco, not far from Tortuga.\r\n\r\nHanged on March 11th, 1722, at St. Kitts.\r\n\r\n\r\nCLARKE, JONATHAN.\r\n\r\nOf Charleston, South Carolina.\r\n\r\nOne of Major Stede Bonnet's crew. Tried for piracy at Charleston in 1718,\r\nand found to be not guilty.\r\n\r\n\r\nCLARKE, RICHARD, _alias_ JAFAR.\r\n\r\nA renegade English sailor, who turned \"Turk\"--that is, became a\r\nMohammedan--and was appointed chief gunner on one of the Barbary pirate\r\nships. Captured in the _Exchange_, and brought into Plymouth in 1622. He\r\nwas hanged.\r\n\r\n\r\nCLARKE, ROBERT.\r\n\r\nGovernor of New Providence, Bahama Islands. Instead of trying to stamp out\r\nthe pirates, he did all he could to encourage them, by granting letters of\r\nmarque to such men as Coxon, to go privateering, these letters being quite\r\nillegal. The proprietors of the Bahama Islands turned Clarke out and\r\nappointed in his place Robert Lilburne in 1682.\r\n\r\n\r\nCLIFFORD, JOHN.\r\n\r\nOne of Captain John Quelch's crew; tried at the Star Tavern at Boston in\r\n1704 for piracy. All the accused pleaded \"Not guilty\" except Clifford and\r\ntwo others who turned Queen's evidence.\r\n\r\n\r\nCLINTON, CAPTAIN.\r\n\r\nOne of the notorious sixteenth century pirates \"who grew famous until\r\nQueene Elizabeth of blessed memory, hanged them at Wapping.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nCOBHAM, CAPTAIN.\r\n\r\nOf Poole in Dorsetshire.\r\n\r\nAt the age of 18 he took to smuggling. His biographer tells us that even\r\nat this comparatively early age Cobham \"was cautious and prudent, and\r\nthough he intrigued with the ladies, he managed to keep it secret.\" Cobham\r\nwas very successful as a smuggler, on one occasion landing a cargo of ten\r\nthousand gallons of brandy at Poole. But a little later on his vessel was\r\ncaptured by a King's cutter. This annoyed the young captain, and he bought\r\na cutter at Bridport, mounted fourteen guns in her, and turned pirate.\r\nOut of his very first prize, an Indiaman, which he boarded off the Mersey,\r\nhe took a sum of £40,000, and then scuttled the ship and drowned the crew.\r\n\r\nCobham, calling in at Plymouth, met a damsel called Maria, whom he took on\r\nboard with him, which at first caused some murmuring amongst his crew, who\r\nwere jealous because they themselves were not able to take lady companions\r\nwith them on their voyages, for, as the same biographer sagely remarks,\r\n\"where a man is married the case is altered, no man envies him his\r\nhappiness; but where he only keeps a girl, every man says, 'I have as much\r\nright to one as he has.'\" Nevertheless, Maria proved herself a great\r\nsuccess, for when any member of the crew was to be punished Maria would\r\nuse her influence with the captain to get him excused or his punishment\r\nlessened, thus winning the affection of all on board. The English Channel\r\nbecoming too dangerous for Cobham, he sailed across the Atlantic and lay\r\nin wait for vessels between Cape Breton and Prince Edward Isle, and took\r\nseveral prizes. In one of these he placed all the crew in sacks and threw\r\nthem into the sea. Maria, too, took her part in these affairs, and once\r\nstabbed to the heart, with her own little dirk, the captain of a Liverpool\r\nbrig, the _Lion_, and on another occasion, to indulge her whim, a captain\r\nand his two mates were tied up to the windlass while Maria shot them with\r\nher pistol. Maria always wore naval uniform, both at sea and when in port;\r\nin fact, she entered thoroughly into the spirit of the enterprise.\r\n\r\nCobham now wished to retire from the sea, but Maria urged him to further\r\nefforts, as she had set her heart on his buying her a beautiful place in\r\nEngland called Mapleton Hall, near Poole.\r\n\r\nMaria's last act at sea was to poison the whole crew of an Indiaman, who\r\nwere prisoners in irons aboard the pirate ship.\r\n\r\nCobham having made a vast fortune, at last decided to settle down, and he\r\nbought a large estate near Havre from the Duc de Chartres. It was on the\r\ncoast, and had a snug little harbour of its own, where the retired pirate\r\nkept a small pleasure yacht in which he and Maria used to go for fishing\r\nexpeditions. One day, when they were out on one of these picnics, a West\r\nIndia brig lay becalmed near by, and Cobham and his crew went on board to\r\nvisit the captain of the merchant ship. But the temptation proved too\r\nstrong, and Cobham suddenly shooting the captain, Maria and the yacht's\r\ncrew quickly despatched the rest. Carrying the prize to Bordeaux, he sold\r\nher for a good price. This was Cobham's last act of piracy, and soon\r\nafterwards he was made a magistrate, and presided at the county courts.\r\nMaria, it was thought, possibly owing to remorse, poisoned herself with\r\nlaudanum and died. Cobham lived to a good old age, and eventually passed\r\naway, leaving many descendants, who, a hundred years ago, \"were moving in\r\nthe first grade at Havre.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nCOBHAM, MRS. MARIA.\r\n\r\nA bloodthirsty and ambitious woman pirate, the wife of Captain Cobham,\r\nlate of Poole in Dorset.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOCKLYN, CAPTAIN THOMAS.\r\n\r\nIn 1717 was in the Bahama Islands when Woodes Rogers arrived at New\r\nProvidence Island with King George's offer of pardon to those pirates who\r\ncame in and surrendered themselves. Cocklyn, like many others, after\r\nsurrendering, fell again into their wicked ways, and ended by being\r\nhanged. Only a year after receiving the royal pardon we hear of him being\r\nin company with Davis and La Bouse and several other notorious pirates at\r\nSierra Leone, when he was in command of a tall ship of twenty-four guns.\r\n\r\nCocklyn ended his life on the gallows.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOFRECINA, CAPTAIN.\r\n\r\nA notorious Spanish-American pirate who was very troublesome in the South\r\nAtlantic in the early part of the last century. Eventually captured by\r\nMidshipman Hull Foot of the U.S. Navy in March, 1825, at St. Thomas Isle.\r\nExecuted in Porto Rico by the terrible Spanish method of the garotte.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOLE, CAPTAIN JOHN.\r\n\r\nCommander of the _Eagle_, _alias_ the _New York Revenge's Revenge_. Tried,\r\ncondemned, and hanged in 1718 at Charleston. His was a brilliant career\r\nwhile it lasted, but was cut short after a brief and meteoric spell.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOLE, SAMUEL.\r\n\r\nOne of Captain Fly's crew. Tried and condemned for piracy at Boston in\r\n1726. On the way to the gallows the culprits were taken to church, where\r\nthey had to listen to a long sermon from Dr. Colman, bringing home to the\r\nwretched creatures their dreadful sins and their awful future.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOLLIER, CAPTAIN EDWARD.\r\n\r\nCommanded the _Oxford_, a King's ship, which was sent from England to\r\nJamaica at the earnest request of Governor Modyford, for a \"nimble\r\nfrigate,\" to help keep control over the increasingly turbulent buccaneers.\r\nCollier's first act was to seize a French man-of-war, a privateer called\r\nthe _Cour Volent_, of La Rochelle, commanded by M. la Vivon, his excuse\r\nbeing that the Frenchmen had robbed an English vessel of provisions.\r\nCollier was appointed to be Morgan's Vice-Admiral, and a few days later\r\nthe _Oxford_ was blown up accidentally while a conference of buccaneer\r\ncaptains was taking place.\r\n\r\nIn 1670, with six ships and 400 men, the buccaneers sailed for the Spanish\r\nMain and sacked the city of Rio de la Hacha. Collier led the left wing in\r\nthe famous and successful attack on Panama City with the rank of colonel.\r\n\r\nRichard Brown reports that Collier could on occasions be very cruel, and\r\nthat he even executed a Spanish friar on the battlefield after quarter had\r\nbeen given to the vanquished. On their return to the coast after the\r\nsacking of Panama, Collier was accused, with Morgan and the other\r\ncommanders, of having cheated the seamen of their fair share of the\r\nplunder, and of deserting them, and then sailing off in the ships with the\r\nsupplies of food as well as the plunder.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOLLINS, THOMAS.\r\n\r\nThis Madagascar pirate was a carpenter by trade, who had by 1716 retired\r\nfrom the sea and lived in splendour in that island. Collins was made\r\nGovernor of the pirate colony, and built a small fort for its defence,\r\nwhich the pirates armed with the guns taken out of their ship, which had\r\nby long use grown old and crazy, and was of no further use to them.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOMRY, ADAM.\r\n\r\nSurgeon to the ship _Elizabeth_, taken by Captain Bartholomew Roberts's\r\nsquadron. Gave evidence at the trial of George Wilson and another\r\nsea-surgeon, Scudamore, that the former had borrowed from Comry a \"clean\r\nshirt and drawers, for his better appearance and reception.\" When visiting\r\nCaptain Bartholomew Roberts's ship, Comry was forced to serve as surgeon\r\non board one of Roberts's vessels.\r\n\r\n\r\nCONDENT, CAPTAIN, _also_ CONGDON or CONDEN.\r\n\r\nBorn at Plymouth in Devonshire.\r\n\r\nCondent was quartermaster in a New York sloop, at the Island of New\r\nProvidence, when Governor Woodes Rogers arrived there in 1718. The captain\r\nof the sloop seems to have thought best to leave rather than wait to\r\nwelcome the new Governor. When only a few days out, one of the crew, an\r\nIndian, who had been cruelly treated, attempted, in revenge, to blow up\r\nthe ship. This was prevented by Condent, who with great courage leapt into\r\nthe hold and shot the Indian, but not before the latter had fired at him\r\nand broken his arm. The crew, to show the relief they felt at being saved\r\nfrom a sudden death, hacked to pieces the body of the Indian, while the\r\ngunner, ripping open the dead man's belly, tore out his heart, which he\r\nboiled and ate.\r\n\r\nTurning their attention from cannibalism to piracy, the pirates took a\r\nprize, the _Duke of York_, but disputes arising, the captain and part of\r\nthe crew sailed in the prize, while Condent was elected captain of the\r\nsloop, and headed across the Atlantic for the Cape Verde Islands, where he\r\nfound the salt fleet, of twenty small vessels, lying at anchor off the\r\nIsland of Mayo, all of which he took. Sailing next to the Island of St.\r\nJago, he took a Dutch ship. This proving a better ship than the sloop,\r\nCondent transferred himself and crew into her, and named her the _Flying\r\nDragon_, presenting the sloop to the mate of an English prize, who he had\r\nforced to go with him. From thence Condent sailed away for the coast of\r\nBrazil, taking several Portuguese ships which, after plundering, he let\r\ngo. After cleaning the _Flying Dragon_ on Ferdinando Island, the pirates\r\ntook several more prizes, and then one day met with a Portuguese\r\nman-of-war of seventy guns. Coming up with her, the Portuguese hailed the\r\npirates, and they answered \"from London bound for Buenos Ayres.\" The\r\nman-of-war, to pay a compliment to the ship of her English ally, manned\r\nthe shrouds and cheered him, and while this amicable demonstration of\r\nmarine brotherly feeling was taking place, Captain Condent came up\r\nalongside and suddenly fired a broadside and a volley of small arms into\r\nthe man-of-war, and a smart engagement followed, in which the pirates were\r\nworsted, and were lucky to escape.\r\n\r\nSailing away round the Cape of Good Hope, Condent arrived at the pirate\r\nstronghold at the Island of Johanna, where he took on board some of\r\nCaptain Halsey's crew, and, reinforced by these skilled masters in the\r\ncraft of piracy, took several rich East Indiamen off the Malabar coast.\r\n\r\nCalling in at the Isle of St. Mary, one of the Mascerenas group, he met\r\nwith another Portuguese ship of seventy guns, which he was fortunate\r\nenough to make a prize of. In this ship they found amongst the passengers\r\nthe Viceroy of Goa. Carrying this rich prize to Zanzibar, they plundered\r\nher of a large amount of money.\r\n\r\nHaving now gathered a vast fortune, they thought it time to give up\r\npiracy, so they returned to the Island of St. Mary, where they made a\r\nshare of their plunder, and the company broke up, many of them settling\r\ndown amongst the natives. Captain Condent and some others sent from here a\r\npetition to the Governor of Mauritius asking for a pardon, and received\r\nanswer that he would take them into his protection if they would destroy\r\ntheir ships. Having done this, they sailed to Mauritius, where they\r\nsettled down, and Captain Condent married the Governor's sister-in-law.\r\n\r\nA few years later the captain and his wife left the island and sailed to\r\nFrance, settling at St. Malo, where Condent drove a considerable trade as\r\na merchant.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOOK, CAPTAIN EDWARD, or EDMUND.\r\n\r\nWas on the Pacific coast with Captains Sharp and Sawkins, 1680. Being\r\nunable to keep order amongst his unruly crew, he resigned his ship and\r\ncommand to Captain John Cox, a New Englander. He commanded a barque in the\r\nsuccessful sacking of Porto Bello in the same year in company with Sharp,\r\nCoxon, and others.\r\n\r\nOn land engagements his flag was a red one striped with yellow, on which\r\nwas a device of a hand and sword.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOOK, GEORGE, _alias_ RAMEDAM.\r\n\r\nAn English renegade amongst the Barbary pirates of Algiers. Was gunner's\r\nmate when captured in the _Exchange_ in 1622. Brought to Plymouth and\r\nhanged.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOOK, WILLIAM.\r\n\r\nServant to Captain Edmund Cook, and was found, on being searched, to have\r\non him a paper with the names of all his fellow pirates written on it, and\r\nwas suspected of having prepared it to give to some of the Spanish\r\nprisoners. For this, Captain Walters put him in irons on January 7th,\r\n1681.\r\n\r\nHe died on board ship on Monday, February 14th, 1681, off the coast of\r\nChile.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOOKE, CAPTAIN JOHN.\r\n\r\nThis buccaneer was born in the Island of St. Christopher. \"A brisk, bold\r\nman,\" he was promoted to the rank of quartermaster by Captain Yankey. On\r\ntaking a Spanish ship, Cooke claimed the command of her, which he was\r\nentitled to, and would have gone in her with an English crew had not the\r\nFrench members of the crew, through jealousy, sacked the ship and marooned\r\nthe Englishmen on the Island of Avache. Cooke and his men were rescued by\r\nanother French buccaneer, Captain Tristram, and taken to the Island of\r\nDominica. Here the English managed to get away with the ship, leaving\r\nTristram and his Frenchmen behind on land. Cooke, now with a ship of his\r\nown, took two French ships loaded with wine. With this valuable cargo he\r\nsteered northward, and reached Virginia in April, 1683. He had no\r\ndifficulty in selling his wine for a good price to the New Englanders, and\r\nwith the profits prepared for a long voyage in his ship, the _Revenge_. He\r\ntook on board with him several famous buccaneers, including Dampier and\r\nCowley, the latter as sailing master. They first sailed to Sierra Leone,\r\nthen round the Horn to the Island of Juan Fernandez. Here Cooke was taken\r\nill. His next stop was at the Galapagos Islands. Eventually Cooke died a\r\nmile or two off the coast of Cape Blanco in Mexico. His body was rowed\r\nashore to be buried, accompanied by an armed guard of twelve seamen. While\r\nhis grave was being dug three Spanish Indians came up, and asked so many\r\nquestions as to rouse the suspicions of the pirates, who seized them as\r\nspies, but one escaping, he raised the whole countryside.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOOPER, CAPTAIN.\r\n\r\nCommanded a pirate sloop, the _Night Rambler_. On November 14th, 1725, he\r\ntook the _Perry_ galley (Captain King, commander), three days out from\r\nBarbadoes, and the following day a French sloop, and carried both prizes\r\nto a small island called Aruba, near Curaçao, where they plundered them\r\nand divided the spoil amongst the crew. The crews of the two prizes were\r\nkept on the island by Cooper for seventeen days, and would have starved if\r\nthe pirate's doctor had not taken compassion on them and procured them\r\nfood.\r\n\r\nUpton, boatswain in the _Perry_, joined the pirates, and was afterwards\r\ntried and hanged in England.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOOPER, CAPTAIN.\r\n\r\nOn October 19th, 1663, he brought into Port Royal, Jamaica, two Spanish\r\nprizes, one the _Maria of Seville_, a royal azogue carrying 1,000 quintals\r\nof quicksilver for the King of Spain's mines in Mexico, besides oil, wine,\r\nand olives. Also a number of prisoners were taken, including several\r\nfriars on their way to Campeachy and Vera Cruz. The buccaneers always\r\nrejoiced at capturing a priest or a friar, and these holy men generally\r\nexperienced very rough treatment at the hands of the pirates.\r\n\r\nCooper's ship was a frigate of ten guns, and a crew of eighty men.\r\n\r\n\r\nCORBET, CAPTAIN.\r\n\r\nSailed with Captain Heidon from Bantry Bay in the _John of Sandwich_ in\r\n1564 to search for a good prize in which he might go a-pirating on his own\r\naccount. The ship was wrecked on the Island of Alderney, and all the crew\r\narrested. Corbett and several others escaped in a small boat.\r\n\r\n\r\nCORNELIUS, CAPTAIN.\r\n\r\nA contemporary of Howard Burgess North and other Madagascar pirates.\r\n\r\n\r\nDE COSSEY, STEPHEN JAMES.\r\n\r\nWith three other pirates was tried and convicted in June, 1717, before the\r\nVice-Admiralty Court at Charleston. The President of the Court was Judge\r\nTrot, a terror to all pirates, as he never failed to hang a guilty one. De\r\nCossey and the other prisoners were found guilty of piratically taking the\r\nvessels _Turtle Dove_, _Penelope_, and the _Virgin Queen_.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOWARD, WILLIAM.\r\n\r\nIn November, 1689, with three men and a boy he rowed out to the ketch\r\n_Elinor_ (William Shortrigs, master), lying at anchor in Boston Harbour,\r\nand seized the vessel and took her to Cape Cod. The crew of the ketch\r\ncould make no resistance as they were all down with the smallpox. The\r\npirates were caught and locked up in the new stone gaol in Boston. Hanged\r\non January 27th, 1690.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOWLEY, CAPTAIN C.\r\n\r\nM.A. Cantab.\r\n\r\nA man of high intelligence and an able navigator. In the year 1683 he\r\nsailed from Achamach or Cape Charles in Virginia for Dominica as sailing\r\nmaster of a privateer, the _Revenge_ (eight guns and fifty-two men), in\r\ncompany with Dampier and Captain John Cooke. As soon as they were away\r\nfrom the land, they turned buccaneers or pirates, and sailed to Sierra\r\nLeone in West Africa. Thence to the coast of Brazil, round the Horn, where\r\nCowley mentions that owing to the intense cold weather the crew were able,\r\neach man, to drink three quarts of burnt brandy a day without becoming\r\ndrunk.\r\n\r\nOn February 14th the buccaneers were abreast of Cape Horn, and in his\r\ndiary Cowley writes: \"We were choosing valentines and discoursing on the\r\nIntrigues of Woman, when there arose a prodigious storm,\" which lasted\r\ntill the end of the month, driving them farther south than any ship had\r\never been before; \"so that we concluded the discoursing of Women at sea\r\nwas very unlucky and occasioned the storm.\" Cowley, who was addicted to\r\ngiving new names to islands, not only named one Pepys Island, but when he\r\narrived at the Galapagos Islands, he rechristened them most thoroughly,\r\nnaming one King Charles Island, while others he named after the Dukes of\r\nYork, Norfolk, and Albemarle, and Sir John Narborough. Feeling, no doubt,\r\nthat he had done enough to honour the great, and perhaps to have insured\r\nhimself against any future trouble with the authorities when he returned\r\nhome, he named one small island \"Cowley's Enchanted Isle.\"\r\n\r\nThe Earl of Alington, Lord Culpepper, Lord Wenman, all had islands in this\r\ngroup christened with their names and titles.\r\n\r\nIn September, 1684, Cowley, now in the _Nicholas_, separated from Davis,\r\nand sailed from Ampalla for San Francisco, and then started west to cross\r\nthe Pacific Ocean. On March 14th, 1685, at seven o'clock in the morning,\r\nafter a voyage of 7,646 miles, land was at last seen, which proved to be\r\nthe Island of Guan.\r\n\r\nThe Spanish Governor was most friendly to the visitors, and when complaint\r\nwas made to him that the buccaneers had killed some of his Indian subjects\r\nhe \"gave us a Toleration to kill them all if we would.\" Presents were\r\nexchanged, Cowley giving the Governor a valuable diamond ring, one, no\r\ndoubt, taken off the hand of some other loyal subject of the King of\r\nSpain. Here the pirates committed several atrocious cruelties on the\r\nIndians, who wished to be friends with the foreigners.\r\n\r\nIn April they arrived at Canton to refit, and while there, thirteen Tartar\r\nships arrived laden with Chinese merchandise, chiefly valuable silks.\r\nCowley wanted to attack and plunder them, but his crew refused to do so,\r\nsaying \"they came for gold and silver, and not to be made pedlars, to\r\ncarry packs on their backs,\" to Cowley's disgust, for he complains, \"had\r\nReason but ruled them, we might all have made our Fortunes and have done\r\nno Christian Prince nor their subjects any harm at all.\" Thence they\r\nsailed to Borneo, the animals and birds of which island Cowley describes.\r\nSailing next to Timor, the crew mutinied, and Cowley and eighteen others\r\nbought a boat and sailed in her to Java, some 300 leagues. Here they heard\r\nof the death of King Charles II., which caused Cowley to get out his map\r\nof the Galapagos Islands, and to change the name of Duke of York Island to\r\nKing James Island. At Batavia Cowley procured a passage in a Dutch ship to\r\nCape Town. In June, 1686, he sailed for Holland after much health drinking\r\nand salutes of 300 guns, arriving in that country in September, and\r\nreaching London, \"through the infinite Mercy of God,\" on October 12th,\r\n1686.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOX, CAPTAIN JOHN. Buccaneer.\r\n\r\nBorn in New England, and considered by some of his fellow buccaneers \"to\r\nhave forced kindred upon Captain Sharp\"--the leader of the fleet--\"out of\r\nold acquaintance, only to advance himself.\" Thus he was made Vice-Admiral\r\nto Captain Sharp, in place of Captain Cook, whose crew had mutinied and\r\nrefused to sail any longer under his command. Cox began his captaincy by\r\ngetting lost, but after a fortnight rejoined the fleet off the Island of\r\nPlate, on the coast of Peru, \"to the great joy of us all.\" This island\r\nreceived its name from the fact that Sir Francis Drake had here made a\r\ndivision of his spoils, distributing to each man of his company sixteen\r\nbowlfuls of doubloons and pieces of eight. The buccaneers rechristened it\r\nDrake's Island.\r\n\r\nCox took part in the attack on the town of Hilo in October, 1679, sacked\r\nthe town and burnt down the large sugar factory outside. He led a mutiny\r\nagainst his relative and benefactor, Captain Sharp, on New Year's Day,\r\n1681, being the \"main promoter of their design\" to turn him out. Sharp\r\nafterwards described his old friend as a \"true-hearted dissembling\r\nNew-England Man,\" who he had promoted captain \"merely for old\r\nacquaintance-sake.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nCOXON, CAPTAIN JOHN. Buccaneer.\r\n\r\nOne of the most famous of the \"Brethren of the Coast.\"\r\n\r\nIn the spring of 1677, in company of other English buccaneers, he\r\nsurprised and plundered the town of Santa Marta on the Spanish Main,\r\ncarrying away the Governor and the Bishop to Jamaica.\r\n\r\nIn 1679 Coxon, with Sharp and others, was fitting out an expedition in\r\nJamaica to make a raid in the Gulf of Honduras, which proved very\r\nsuccessful, as they brought back 500 chests of indigo, besides cocoa,\r\ncochineal, tortoiseshell, money, and plate.\r\n\r\nCoxon was soon out again upon a much bolder design, for in December, 1679,\r\nhe met Sharp, Essex, Allinson, Row, and other buccaneer chiefs at Point\r\nMorant, and in January set sail for Porto Bello. Landing some twenty\r\nleagues from the town, they marched for four days, arriving in sight of\r\nthe town on February 17th, \"many of them being weak, being three days\r\nwithout any food, and their feet cut with the rocks for want of shoes.\"\r\nThey quickly took and plundered the town, hurrying off with their spoils\r\nbefore the arrival of strong Spanish reinforcements. The share of each man\r\nin this enterprise came to one hundred pieces of eight. A warrant was\r\nissued by Lord Carlisle, the Governor of Jamaica, for the apprehension of\r\nCoxon for plundering Porto Bello, and another was issued soon after by\r\nMorgan, when acting as Governor, but nothing seems to have resulted from\r\nthese. Sailing north to Boca del Toro, they careened their ships, and were\r\njoined by Sawkins and Harris. From this place the buccaneers began, in\r\nApril, 1680, to land and cross the Isthmus of Darien, taking the town of\r\nSanta Maria on the way. Quarrels took place between Coxon, who was, no\r\ndoubt, a hot-tempered man, and Harris, which led to blows. Coxon was also\r\njealous of the popular young Captain Sawkins, and refused to go further\r\nunless he was allowed to lead one of the companies. After sacking the town\r\nof Santa Maria, the adventurers proceeded in canoes down the river to the\r\nPacific. Seizing two small vessels they found there, and accompanied by a\r\nflotilla of canoes, they steered for Panama, and, with the utmost daring,\r\nattacked, and eventually took, the Spanish fleet of men-of-war--one of the\r\nmost remarkable achievements in the history of the buccaneers.\r\n\r\nCoxon now quarrelled again with his brother leaders, and began a march\r\nback across the isthmus; his party of seventy malcontents including\r\nDampier and Wafer, who each published accounts of their journey. By 1682\r\nCoxon seems to have so ingratiated himself with the Jamaican authorities\r\nas to be sent in quest of a troublesome French pirate, Jean Hamlin, who\r\nwas playing havoc with the English shipping in his vessel, _La Trompeuse_.\r\n\r\nLater in the same year Coxon procured letters of marque from Robert\r\nClarke, the Governor of New Providence Island, himself nothing better than\r\na pirate, to go cruising as a \"privateer.\" Coxon was continually being\r\narrested and tried for piracy, but each time he managed to escape the\r\ngallows. We do not know the name of the ship Coxon commanded at this date,\r\nbut it was a vessel of eighty tons, armed with eight guns, and carrying a\r\ncrew of ninety-seven men.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOYLE, CAPTAIN RICHARD.\r\n\r\nBorn at Exeter in Devonshire.\r\n\r\nAn honest seafaring man until, when sailing as mate with Captain Benjamin\r\nHartley, they arrived at Ancona with a cargo of pilchards. Here the\r\ncaptain took on board a new carpenter, called Richardson, who soon became\r\na close friend of the mate's. These two brought about a mutiny, attacked\r\nthe captain, and threw him, still alive, over the side to drown. Coyle was\r\nelected captain, and they sailed as pirates, in which capacity they were a\r\ndisgrace to an ancient calling. After a visit to Minorca, which ended with\r\nignominy, they sailed to Tunis, where Coyle told such a plausible yarn as\r\nto deceive the Governor into believing that he had been the master of a\r\nvessel lost in a storm off the coast of Sardinia. The pirates were\r\nsupplied with money by the British Consul in Tunis; but Coyle, while in\r\nhis cups, talked too freely, so that the true story of his doings got to\r\nthe Consul's ears, who had him arrested and sent to London to be lodged in\r\nthe Marshalsea Prison. Tried at the Old Bailey, he was sentenced to death,\r\nand was hanged at Execution Dock on January 25th, 1738.\r\n\r\n\r\nCRACKERS, CAPTAIN.\r\n\r\nA retired pirate who settled at Sierra Leone, and was living there in\r\n1721. He had been famous in his day, having robbed and plundered many a\r\nship. He owned the best house in the settlement, and was distinguished by\r\nhaving three cannons placed before his door, which he was accustomed to\r\nfire salutes from whenever a pirate ship arrived or left the port. He was\r\nthe soul of hospitality and good fellowship, and kept open-house for all\r\npirates, buccaneers, and privateersmen.\r\n\r\n\r\nCRISS, CAPTAIN JOHN, _alias_ \"JACK THE BACHELOR.\"\r\n\r\nA native of Lorne in the North of Ireland.\r\n\r\nHis father was a fisherman, and little Jack used to go out with him, and\r\nthen help him sell his fish at Londonderry. The lad grew up into a bold\r\nand handsome young fellow, \"and many a girl cocked cap at him and he had\r\ngreat success amongst the ladies, and intrigued with every woman that gave\r\nhim any encouragement.\"\r\n\r\nTiring of the monotony and low profits of a fisherman's calling, Jack\r\nturned smuggler, carrying cargoes of contraband goods from Guernsey to\r\nIreland. Making a tidy sum at this, he bought himself a French galliot,\r\nand sailing from Cork, he began to take vessels off the coast of France,\r\nselling them at Cherbourg. The young pirate took no risks of information\r\nleaking out, for he drowned all his prisoners. Cruising in the\r\nMediterranean, Criss met with his usual success, and, not content with\r\ntaking ships, he plundered the seaport of Amalfi on the coast of Calabria.\r\nCalling at Naples, Criss put up at the Ferdinand Hotel, where one morning\r\nhe was found dead in his bed. It was discovered afterwards that, in spite\r\nof his nickname, he was married to three wives.\r\n\r\n\r\nCULLEN, ANDREW.\r\n\r\nOf Cork in Ireland.\r\n\r\nBrother of Pierce Cullen. One of the crew of Captain Roche's ship. After\r\nthe crew had mutinied and turned pirate he posed as the supercargo.\r\n\r\n\r\nCULLEN, PIERCE.\r\n\r\nOf Cork in Ireland.\r\n\r\nOne of Captain Philip Roche's gang.\r\n\r\n\r\nCULLIFORD, CAPTAIN, of the _Mocha_.\r\n\r\nA Madagascar pirate.\r\n\r\nLittle is known of him except that one day in the streets of London he\r\nrecognized and denounced another pirate called Burgess.\r\n\r\n\r\nCUMBERLAND, GEORGE, THIRD EARL OF, 1558-1605.\r\n\r\nM.A., Trinity College, Cambridge.\r\n\r\nAfter taking his degree at Cambridge he migrated to Oxford for the purpose\r\nof studying geography.\r\n\r\nSo many books have been written about this picturesque and daring\r\nadventurer that it is not necessary to do more than mention his name here,\r\nas being perhaps the finest example of a buccaneer that ever sacked a\r\nSpanish town.\r\n\r\nHe led twelve voyages to the Spanish Main, fitting them out at his own\r\nexpense, and encountering the same dangers and hardships as his meanest\r\nseaman.\r\n\r\nHe married in 1577 at the age of nineteen, and sailed on his first voyage\r\nin 1586. Cumberland was greatly esteemed by Queen Elizabeth, and always\r\nwore in his hat a glove which she had given him.\r\n\r\nThere is sufficient evidence to show that the Earl was not prompted to\r\nspend his life and fortune on buccaneering voyages merely by greed of\r\nplunder, but was chiefly inspired by intense love of his country, loyalty\r\nto his Queen, and bitter hatred of the Spaniards.\r\n\r\n\r\nCUNNINGHAM, CAPTAIN WILLIAM.\r\n\r\nHad his headquarters at New Providence Island, in the Bahamas. Refused the\r\nroyal offer of pardon to the pirates in 1717, and was later caught and\r\nhanged.\r\n\r\n\r\nCUNNINGHAM, PATRICK.\r\n\r\nFound guilty at Newport in 1723, but reprieved.\r\n\r\n\r\nCURTICE, JOSEPH.\r\n\r\nOne of Captain Teach's crew in the _Queen Ann's Revenge_. Killed on\r\nNovember 22nd, 1718, off the coast of North Carolina.\r\n\r\n\r\nDAMPIER, CAPTAIN WILLIAM. Buccaneer, explorer, and naturalist.\r\n\r\nBorn at East Coker in the year 1652.\r\n\r\nBrought up at first to be a shopkeeper, a life he detested, he was in 1669\r\napprenticed to a ship belonging to Weymouth, and his first voyage was to\r\nFrance. In the same year he sailed to Newfoundland, but finding the bitter\r\ncold unbearable, he returned to England. His next voyage, which he called\r\n\"a warm one,\" was to the East Indies, in the _John and Martha_, and suited\r\nhim better.\r\n\r\nMany books have been written recounting the voyages of Dampier, but none\r\nof these are better reading than his own narrative, published by James and\r\nJohn Knapton in London. This popular book ran into many editions, the best\r\nbeing the fourth, published in 1729, in four volumes. These volumes are\r\nprofusely illustrated by maps and rough charts, and also with crude cuts,\r\nwhich are intended to portray the more interesting and strange animals,\r\nbirds, fishes, and insects met with in his voyages round the globe.\r\n\r\nIn 1673 Dampier enlisted as a seaman in the _Royal Prince_, commanded by\r\nthe famous Sir Edward Spragge, and fought in the Dutch war.\r\n\r\nA year later he sailed to Jamaica in the _Content_, to take up a post as\r\nmanager of a plantation belonging to a Colonel Hellier. His restless\r\nspirit soon revolted against this humdrum life on a plantation, and\r\nDampier again went to sea, sailing in a small trading vessel amongst the\r\nislands.\r\n\r\nDampier's first step towards buccaneering was taken when he shipped\r\nhimself on a small ketch which was sailing from Port Royal to load logwood\r\nat the Bay of Campeachy. This was an illegal business, as the Spanish\r\nGovernment claimed the ownership of all that coast, and did their best to\r\nprevent the trade. Dampier found some 250 Englishmen engaged in cutting\r\nthe wood, which they exchanged for rum. Most of these men were buccaneers\r\nor privateers, who made a living in this way when out of a job afloat.\r\nWhen a ship came into the coast, these men would think nothing of coming\r\naboard and spending thirty and forty pounds on rum and punch at a single\r\ndrinking bout.\r\n\r\nDampier returned afterwards to take up logwood cutting himself, but met\r\nwith little success, and went off to Beef Island. He had by this time\r\nbegun to take down notes of all that appeared to him of interest,\r\nparticularly objects of natural history. For example, he described, in his\r\nown quaint style, an animal he found in this island.\r\n\r\n\"The Squash is a four-footed Beast, bigger than a Cat. Its Head is much\r\nlike a Foxes, with short Ears and a long Nose. It has pretty short Legs\r\nand sharp Claws, by which it will run up trees like a Cat. The flesh is\r\ngood, sweet, wholesome Meat. We commonly skin and roast it; and then we\r\ncall it pig; and I think it eats as well. It feeds on nothing but good\r\nFruit; therefore we find them most among the Sapadillo-Trees. This\r\nCreature never rambles very far, and being taken young, will become as\r\ntame as a Dog, and be as roguish as a Monkey.\"\r\n\r\nDampier's first act of actual piracy was when he joined in an attack on\r\nthe Spanish fort of Alvarado, but although the fort was taken, the\r\ntownspeople had time to escape with all their valuables before the pirates\r\ncould reach them. Returning to England in 1678, he did not remain long at\r\nhome, for in the beginning of 1679 he sailed for Jamaica in a vessel named\r\nthe _Loyal Merchant_. Shortly after reaching the West Indies, he chanced\r\nto meet with several well-known buccaneers, including Captains Coxon,\r\nSawkins, and Sharp. Joining with these, he sailed on March 25th, 1679, for\r\nthe Province of Darien, \"to pillage and plunder these parts.\" Dampier says\r\nstrangely little about his adventures for the next two years, but a full\r\ndescription of them is given by Ringrose in his \"Dangerous Voyage and Bold\r\nAdventures of Captain Sharp and Others in the South Sea,\" published as an\r\naddition to the \"History of the Buccaneers of America\" in 1684.\r\n\r\nThis narrative tells how the buccaneers crossed the isthmus and attacked\r\nand defeated the Spanish Fleet off Panama City. After the death of their\r\nleader, Sawkins, the party split up, and Dampier followed Captain Sharp on\r\nhis \"dangerous and bold voyage\" in May, 1680.\r\n\r\nIn April, 1681, after various adventures up and down the coast of Peru and\r\nChile, further quarrels arose amongst the buccaneers, and a party of\r\nmalcontents, of which number Dampier was one, went off on their own\r\naccount in a launch and two canoes from the Island of Plate, made famous\r\nby Drake, and landed on the mainland near Cape San Lorenzo. The march\r\nacross the Isthmus of Darien has been amusingly recounted by the surgeon\r\nof the party, Lionel Wafer, in his book entitled \"A New Voyage and\r\nDescription of the Isthmus of America,\" published in London in 1699.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A PAGE FROM THE LOG-BOOK OF CAPTAIN DAMPIER.\r\n\r\nTo face p. 98.]\r\n\r\nOn reaching the Atlantic, Dampier found some buccaneer ships and joined\r\nthem, arriving at Virginia in July, 1682. In this country he resided for a\r\nyear, but tells little about it beyond hinting that great troubles befell\r\nhim. In April, 1683, he joined a privateer vessel, the _Revenge_, but\r\ndirectly she was out of sight of land the crew turned pirates, which had\r\nbeen their intention all along. Two good narratives have been written of\r\nthis voyage, one by Dampier, and the other by Cowley, the sailing-master.\r\nThis venture ended in the famous circumnavigation of the world, and\r\nDampier described every object of interest he met with, including the\r\ncountry and natives of the north coast of Australia, which had never been\r\nvisited before by Europeans. Dampier must have found it very difficult to\r\nkeep his journal so carefully and regularly, particularly in his early\r\nvoyages, when he was merely a seaman before the mast or a petty officer.\r\nHe tells us that he carried about with him a long piece of hollow bamboo,\r\nin which he placed his manuscript for safe keeping, waxing the ends to\r\nkeep out the sea water.\r\n\r\nAfter almost endless adventures and hardships, he arrived back in England\r\nin September, 1691, after a voyage of eight years, and an absence from\r\nEngland of twelve, without a penny piece in his pocket, nor any other\r\nproperty except his unfortunate friend Prince Jeoly, whom he sold on his\r\narrival in the Thames, to supply his own immediate wants. Dampier's next\r\nvoyage was in the year 1699, when he was appointed to command H.M.S.\r\n_Roebuck_, of twelve guns and a crew of fifty men and boys, and victualled\r\nfor twenty months' cruise. The object of this voyage was to explore and\r\nmap the new continent to the south of the East Indies which Dampier had\r\ndiscovered on his previous voyage. Had he in this next voyage taken the\r\nwestward course, as he originally intended, and sailed to Australia round\r\nthe Horn, it is possible that Dampier would have made many of the\r\ndiscoveries for which James Cook afterwards became so famous, and by\r\nstriking the east coast of Australia would very likely have antedated the\r\ncivilisation of that continent by fifty years. But he was persuaded,\r\npartly by his timid crew, and perhaps in some measure by his own dislike\r\nof cold temperatures, to sail by the eastward route and to double the Cape\r\nof Good Hope. The story of this voyage is given by Dampier in his book,\r\npublished in 1709, \"A Voyage to New Holland, etc., in the Year 1699.\"\r\n\r\nAfter spending some unprofitable weeks on the north coast of Australia,\r\nfailing to find water or to make friends with the aboriginals, scurvy\r\nbroke out amongst his somewhat mutinous crew, and he sailed to New Guinea,\r\nthe coast of which he saw on New Year's Day, 1700.\r\n\r\nBy this time the _Roebuck_ was falling to pieces, her wood rotten, her\r\nhull covered with barnacles. Eventually, using the pumps day and night,\r\nthey arrived, on February 21st, 1701, at Ascension Island, where the old\r\nship sank at her anchors. Getting ashore with their belongings, they\r\nwaited on this desolate island until April 3rd, when four ships arrived,\r\nthree of them English men-of-war.\r\n\r\nI was told, only the other day, by a friend who lives in the Island of St.\r\nHelena, and whose duties take him at least once each year to Ascension\r\nIsland, that a story still survives amongst the inhabitants of these\r\nislands that there is hidden somewhere in the sandhills a treasure, which\r\nDampier is believed to have put there for safe keeping, but for some\r\nreason never removed. But poor Dampier never came by a treasure in this or\r\nany other of his voyages, and though the legend is a pleasant one, it is a\r\nlegend and nothing more. Dampier went on board one of the men-of-war, the\r\n_Anglesea_, with thirty-five of his crew. Taken to Barbadoes, he there\r\nprocured a berth in another vessel, the _Canterbury_, in which he sailed\r\nto England.\r\n\r\nDampier had now made so great a name for himself by his two voyages round\r\nthe globe that he was granted a commission by Prince George of Denmark to\r\nsail as a privateer in the _St. George_, to prey on French and Spanish\r\nships, the terms being: \"No purchase, no pay.\" Sailing as his consort was\r\nthe _Cinque Ports_, whose master was Alexander Selkirk, the original of\r\nRobinson Crusoe. This voyage, fully recounted in Dampier's book, is a long\r\ntale of adventure, hardship, and disaster, and the explorer eventually\r\nreturned to England a beggar. However, his travels made a great stir, and\r\nhe was allowed to kiss the Queen's hand and to have the honour of relating\r\nhis adventures to her.\r\n\r\nDampier's last voyage was in the capacity of pilot or navigating officer\r\nto Captain Woodes Rogers in the _Duke_, which sailed with another Bristol\r\nprivateer, the _Duchess_, in 1708. The interesting narrative of this\r\nsuccessful voyage is told by Rogers in his book, \"A Cruising Voyage Round\r\nthe World,\" etc., published in 1712. Another account was written by the\r\ncaptain of the _Duchess_, Edward Cooke, and published in the same year.\r\nThis last voyage round the world ended at Erith on October 14th, 1711, and\r\nwas the only one in which Dampier returned with any profit other than to\r\nhis reputation as an explorer and navigator.\r\n\r\nDampier was now fifty-nine years of age, and apparently never went to sea\r\nagain. In fact, he henceforth disappears from the stage altogether, and is\r\nsupposed to have died in Colman Street in London, in the year 1715. Of\r\nDampier's early life in England little is known, except that he owned, at\r\none time, a small estate in Somersetshire, and that in 1678 he married \"a\r\nyoung woman out of the family of the Duchess of Grafton.\" There is an\r\ninteresting picture of Dampier in the National Portrait Gallery, painted\r\nby T. Murray, and I take this opportunity to thank the directors for\r\ntheir kind permission to reproduce this portrait.\r\n\r\nOne other book Dampier wrote, called a \"Discourse of Winds,\" an\r\ninteresting work, and one which added to the author's reputation as a\r\nhydrographer. There is little doubt that Defoe was inspired by the\r\nexperiences and writings of Dampier, not only in his greatest work,\r\n\"Robinson Crusoe,\" but also in \"Captain Singleton,\" \"Colonel Jack,\" \"A New\r\nVoyage Round the World,\" and many of the maritime incidents in \"Roxana\"\r\nand \"Moll Flanders.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nDAN, JOSEPH.\r\n\r\nOne of Avery's crew. Turned King's witness at his trial in 1696, and was\r\nnot hanged.\r\n\r\n\r\nDANIEL, CAPTAIN. A French filibuster.\r\n\r\nThe name of this bloodthirsty pirate will go down to fame as well as\r\nnotoriety by his habit of combining piracy with strict Church discipline.\r\nHarling recounts an example of this as follows, the original account of\r\nthe affair being written by a priest, M. Labat, who seems to have had\r\nrather a weak spot in his heart for the buccaneer fraternity:\r\n\r\n\"Captain Daniel, in need of provisions, anchored one night off one of the\r\n'Saintes,' small islands near Dominica, and landing without opposition,\r\ntook possession of the house of the curé and of some other inhabitants of\r\nthe neighbourhood. He carried the curé and his people on board his ship\r\nwithout offering them the least violence, and told them that he merely\r\nwished to buy some wine, brandy and fowls. While these were being\r\ngathered, Daniel requested the curé to celebrate Mass, which the poor\r\npriest dared not refuse. So the necessary sacred vessels were sent for and\r\nan altar improvised on the deck for the service, which they chanted to the\r\nbest of their ability. As at Martinique, the Mass was begun by a\r\ndischarge of artillery, and after the Exaudiat and prayer for the King,\r\nwas closed by a loud 'Vive la Roi!' from the throats of the buccaneers. A\r\nsingle incident, however, somewhat disturbed the devotions. One of the\r\nbuccaneers, remaining in an indecent attitude during the Elevation, was\r\nrebuked by the captain, and instead of heeding the correction, replied\r\nwith an impertinence and a fearful oath. Quick as a flash Daniel whipped\r\nout his pistol and shot the buccaneer through the head, adjuring God that\r\nhe would do as much to the first who failed in his respect to the Holy\r\nSacrifice. The shot was fired close by the priest, who, as we can readily\r\nimagine, was considerably agitated. 'Do not be troubled, my father,' said\r\nDaniel; 'he is a rascal lacking in his duty and I have punished him to\r\nteach him better.'\" A very efficacious means, remarks Labat, of preventing\r\nhis falling into another like mistake. After the Mass the body of the dead\r\nman was thrown into the sea, and the curé was recompensed for his pains by\r\nsome goods out of their stock and the present of a negro slave.\r\n\r\n\r\nDANIEL, STEPHEN.\r\n\r\nOne of Captain Teach's crew. Hanged for piracy in Virginia in 1718.\r\n\r\n\r\nDANSKER, CAPTAIN.\r\n\r\nA Dutch pirate who cruised in the Mediterranean in the sixteenth century,\r\nusing the North African coast as his base. He joined the Moors and turned\r\nMohammedan. In 1671 Admiral Sir Edward Spragge was with a fleet at Bougie\r\nBay, near Algiers, where, after a sharp fight, he burnt and destroyed a\r\nbig fleet of the Moorish pirates, amongst those killed being the renegade\r\nDansker.\r\n\r\n\r\nDARBY, JOHN.\r\n\r\nA Marblehead fisherman, one of the crew of the ketch _Mary_, of Salem,\r\ncaptured by Captain Pound. He joined the pirates, and was killed at\r\nTarpaulin Cove.\r\n\r\n\r\nDAVIS, CAPTAIN EDWARD. Buccaneer and pirate.\r\n\r\nFlourished from 1683-1702. According to Esquemiling, who knew Davis\r\npersonally, his name was John, but some authorities call him Edward, the\r\nname he is given in the \"Dictionary of National Biography.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1683 Davis was quartermaster to Captain Cook when he took the ship of\r\nCaptain Tristian, a French buccaneer, of Petit Guave in the West Indies.\r\nSailed north to cruise off the coast of Virginia. From there he sailed\r\nacross the Atlantic to West Africa, and at Sierra Leone came upon a Danish\r\nship of thirty-six guns, which he attacked and took. The pirates shifted\r\ntheir crew into this ship, christening her the _Bachelor's Delight_, and\r\nsailed for Juan Fernandez in the South Pacific, arriving there in March,\r\n1684. Here they met with Captain Brown, in the _Nicholas_, and together\r\nsailed to the Galapagos Islands. About this time Captain Cook died, and\r\nDavis was elected captain in his place. Cruising along the coasts of Chile\r\nand Peru, they sacked towns and captured Spanish ships. On November 3rd\r\nDavis landed, and burnt the town of Paita. Their principal plan was to\r\nwaylay the Spanish Fleet on its voyage to Panama. This fleet arrived off\r\nthe Bay of Panama on May 28th, 1685, but the buccaneers were beaten and\r\nwere lucky to escape with their lives. At the Gulf of Ampalla, Davis had\r\nto put his sick on shore, as spotted fever raged amongst the crew. Davis\r\nthen cruised for a while with the buccaneer Knight, sacking several\r\ntowns.\r\n\r\nDeciding to return to the West Indies with their plunder, several of the\r\ncrew, who had lost all their share by gambling, were left, at their own\r\nrequest, on the Island of Juan Fernandez. Davis then sailed round the\r\nHorn, arriving safely at Jamaica with a booty of more than 50,000 pieces\r\nof eight, besides quantities of plate and jewels.\r\n\r\nAt Port Royal, after he had accepted the offer of pardon of King James\r\nII., Davis sailed to Virginia and settled down at Point Comfort. We hear\r\nno more of him for the next fourteen years, until July 24th, 1702, when he\r\nsailed from Jamaica in the _Blessing_ (Captain Brown; twenty guns,\r\nseventy-nine men), to attack the town of Tolu on the Spanish Main, which\r\nwas plundered and burnt. Davis next sailed to the Samballoes, and, guided\r\nby the Indians, who were friendly to the buccaneers, but hated the\r\nSpaniards, they attacked the gold-mines, where, in spite of most cruel\r\ntortures, they got but little gold. The crew next attacked Porto Bello,\r\nbut found little worth stealing in that much harassed town.\r\n\r\nDavis is chiefly remarkable for having commanded his gang of ruffians in\r\nthe Pacific for nearly four years. To do this he must have been a man of\r\nextraordinary personality and bravery, for no other buccaneer or pirate\r\ncaptain ever remained in uninterrupted power for so long a while, with the\r\nexception of Captain Bartholomew Roberts.\r\n\r\n\r\nDAVIS, CAPTAIN HOWEL.\r\n\r\nThis Welsh pirate was born at Milford in Monmouthshire. He went to sea as\r\na boy, and eventually sailed as chief mate in the _Cadogan_ snow, of\r\nBristol, to the Guinea Coast. His ship was taken off Sierra Leone by the\r\npirate England, and the captain murdered. Davis turned pirate, and was\r\ngiven command of this old vessel, the _Cadogan_, in which to go \"on the\r\naccount.\" But the crew refused to turn pirate, and sailed the ship to\r\nBarbadoes, and there handed Davis over to the Governor, who imprisoned him\r\nfor three months and then liberated him. As no one on the island would\r\noffer him employment, Davis went to New Providence Island, the stronghold\r\nof the West India pirates.\r\n\r\nArrived there, he found that Captain Woodes Rogers had only lately come\r\nfrom England with an offer of a royal pardon, which most of the pirates\r\nhad availed themselves of. Davis got employment under the Governor, on\r\nboard the sloop, the _Buck_, to trade goods with the French and Spanish\r\nsettlements. The crew was composed of the very recently reformed pirates,\r\nand no sooner was the sloop out of sight of land than they mutinied and\r\nseized the vessel, Davis being voted captain, on which occasion, over a\r\nbowl of punch in the great cabin, the new captain made an eloquent speech,\r\nfinishing by declaring war against the whole world. Davis proved himself\r\nan enterprising and successful pirate chief, but preferred, whenever\r\npossible, to use strategy and cunning rather than force to gain his ends.\r\nHis first prize was a big French ship, which, although Davis had only a\r\nsmall sloop and a crew of but thirty-five men, he managed to take by a\r\nbold and clever trick. After taking a few more ships in the West Indies,\r\nDavies sailed across the Atlantic to the Island of St. Nicholas in the\r\nCape Verde Islands. Here he and his crew were a great social success,\r\nspending weeks on shore as the guests of the Governor and chief\r\ninhabitants. When Davis reluctantly left this delightful spot, five of his\r\ncrew were missing, \"being so charmed with the Luxuries of the Place, and\r\nthe Conversation of some Women, that they stayed behind.\"\r\n\r\nDavis now went cruising and took a number of vessels, and arrived\r\neventually at St. Jago. The Portuguese Governor of this island did not\r\ntake at all kindly to his bold visitor, and was blunt enough to say he\r\nsuspected Davis of being a pirate. This suspicion his crew took exception\r\nto, and they decided they could not let such an insult pass, so that very\r\nnight they made a sudden attack on the fort, taking and plundering it.\r\n\r\nDavis sailed away next morning to the coast and anchored off the Castle of\r\nGambia, which was strongly held for the African Company by the Governor\r\nand a garrison of English soldiers. Davis, nothing daunted, proposed to\r\nhis merry men a bold and ingenious stratagem by which they could take the\r\ncastle, and, the crew agreeing, it was carried out with so much success\r\nthat they soon had the castle, Governor, and soldiers in their possession,\r\nas well as a rich spoil of bars of gold; and all these without a solitary\r\ncasualty on either side. After this brilliant coup, many of the soldiers\r\njoined the pirates. The pirates were attacked shortly afterwards by a\r\nFrench ship commanded by Captain La Bouse, but on both ships hoisting\r\ntheir colours, the Jolly Roger, they understood each other and\r\nfraternized, and then sailed together to Sierra Leone, where they attacked\r\na tall ship they found lying there at anchor. This ship also proved to be\r\na pirate, commanded by one Captain Cocklyn, so the three joined forces and\r\nassaulted the fort, which, after a sharp bombardment, surrendered. Davis\r\nwas then elected commander of the pirate fleet, but one night, when\r\nentertaining the other captains in his cabin, all having drunk freely of\r\npunch, they started to quarrel, and blows were threatened, when Davis,\r\nwith true Celtic eloquence, hiccupped out the following speech:\r\n\r\n\"Hearke ye, you Cocklyn and La Bouse. I find by strengthening you I have\r\nput a rod into your Hands to whip myself, but I'm still able to deal with\r\nyou both; but since we met in Love, let us part in Love, for I find that\r\nthree of a Trade can never agree.\" Alone once more, Davis had prodigious\r\nsuccess, taking prize after prize, amongst others the _Princess_, the\r\nsecond mate in which was one Roberts, soon to become a most famous pirate.\r\nOff Anamaboe he took a very rich prize, a Hollander ship, on board of\r\nwhich was the Governor of Accra and his retinue, as well as £15,000\r\nsterling and rich merchandise. Arriving next at the Portuguese Island of\r\nPrinces, Davis posed as an English man-of-war in search of pirates, and\r\nwas most warmly welcomed by the Governor, who received him in person with\r\na guard of honour and entertained him most hospitably. Davis heard that\r\nthe Governor and the chief persons of the island had sent their wives to a\r\nvillage a few miles away, so the pirate and a few chosen spirits decided\r\nto pay a surprise visit on these ladies. However, the ladies, on\r\nperceiving their gallant callers, shrieked and ran into the woods and, in\r\nfact, made such a hullabaloo that the English Don Juans were glad to slink\r\naway, and \"the Thing made some noise, but not being known was passed\r\nover.\"\r\n\r\nDavis, ever a cunning rogue, now formed a pretty scheme to take the\r\nGovernor and chief inhabitants prisoners and to hold them for a big\r\nransom. This plan was spoilt by a Portuguese slave swimming to shore and\r\ntelling the Governor all about it, and worse, telling him about the little\r\naffair of Davis and his visit to the ladies in the wood. The Governor now\r\nlaid his plans, and with such success that Davis walked unsuspecting into\r\nthe trap, and was \"shot in the bowels,\" but it is some consolation to know\r\nthat he \"dyed like a game Cock,\" as he shot two of the Portuguese with his\r\npistols as he fell.\r\n\r\nThus died a man noted during his lifetime by his contemporaries for his\r\n\"affability and good nature,\" which only goes to show how one's point of\r\nview is apt to be influenced by circumstances.\r\n\r\n\r\nDAVIS, GABRIEL.\r\n\r\nTried for piracy at the Star Tavern in Boston, Massachusetts, in 1704.\r\n\r\n\r\nDAVIS, WILLIAM.\r\n\r\nA Welshman.\r\n\r\nArrived at Sierra Leone in honest employ in the _Ann_ galley. Quarrelling\r\nwith the mate, whom he beat, he deserted his ship and went to live ashore\r\nwith the negroes, one of whom he married, with whom he settled down. One\r\nevening, the weather being hot, and Davis being very thirsty, he sold his\r\nbride for some punch. His wife's relations, being indignant, seized Davis,\r\nwho told them, being, perhaps, still a little under the influence of the\r\npunch, that he did not care if they took his head off. But his \"in-laws\"\r\nknew a more profitable way of being revenged than that, and sold him to\r\nSeignior Joffee, a Christian black. Soon afterwards Captain Roberts, in\r\nthe _Royal Fortune_, arrived in the bay, and Davis ran away and joined the\r\npirates.\r\n\r\nHanged at the age of 23.\r\n\r\n\r\nDAWES. Corsair.\r\n\r\nAn English renegade.\r\n\r\nWhen Roberts was cast away on June 12th, 1692, in Nio, a small island in\r\nthe Grecian Archipelago, in His Majesty's hired ship the _Arcana_ galley,\r\nmost of the crew escaped in a French prize they had taken. Roberts\r\nremained behind, hoping to save some of his valuables, which were in the\r\n_Arcana_. But on June 15th a crusal, or corsair, appeared in the harbour,\r\nwhich Roberts's five companions went on board of. Various designs were\r\nmade by the corsair captain to induce Roberts to come aboard. Eventually\r\nan Englishman named Dawes (a native of Saltash in Cornwall) was sent\r\nashore. He had served for eight years in the corsair until taken out of\r\nher a short time previously by the _Arcana_. Roberts writes, in his frank\r\nstyle: \"But Dawes, like a Dog returning to his Vomit, went on Board\r\nagain.\" Eventually a party of the corsair's landed under the leadership of\r\nDawes, and captured Roberts and carried him on board the pirate craft,\r\nwhere for many years he worked as a slave.\r\n\r\n\r\nDAWES, ROBERT.\r\n\r\nOne of the mutineers on the brig _Vineyard_ in 1830. It was the full\r\nconfession of Dawes that brought about the conviction and execution of the\r\nringleader, Charles Gibbs.\r\n\r\n\r\nDAWSON, JOSEPH.\r\n\r\nOne of Captain Avery's crew of the _Charles the Second_. Tried at the Old\r\nBailey in 1696 for piracy, and convicted. He pleaded to be spared and to\r\nbe sent to servitude in India, but was hanged at Execution Dock.\r\n\r\n\r\nDEAL, CAPTAIN ROBERT.\r\n\r\nMate to Captain Vane in 1718. He was very active off the coast of Carolina\r\nand New England, taking many prizes. In November, 1718, when cruising\r\nbetween Cape Meise and Cape Nicholas, on the lookout for ships, he met\r\nwith and fired on a vessel that appeared to be a merchantman, at the same\r\ntime running up the Jolly Roger. The apparently peaceful merchantman\r\nreplied with a broadside, and proved to be a French man-of-war. A quarrel\r\ntook place amongst the pirates, Vane and some of the crew, including\r\nDeal, being for running away for safety, while the rest, headed by Rackam,\r\nwere in favour of fighting it out. Vane insisted on their escaping, which\r\nthey did, but next day he, Deal, and some others were turned out of the\r\nship and sent away on their own in a small sloop. Deal was put in command\r\nof this sloop, but was soon afterwards captured by an English man-of-war\r\nand brought to Jamaica, where he was tried, convicted, and hanged.\r\n\r\n\r\nDEANE, CAPTAIN JOHN. Buccaneer.\r\n\r\nCommanded the _St. David_. He was accused by the Governor of Jamaica in\r\n1676 of having held up a ship called the _John Adventure_ and of taking\r\nout of her several pipes of wine and a cable worth £100, and of forcibly\r\ncarrying the vessel to Jamaica. Deane was also reported for wearing Dutch,\r\nFrench, and Spanish colours without commission, and was tried and\r\ncondemned to suffer death as a pirate. Owing to various legal, or illegal,\r\nquibbles, Deane was reprieved.\r\n\r\n\r\nDEDRAN, LE CAPITAINE. A French filibuster of French Domingo.\r\n\r\nCommanded, in 1684, the _Chasseur_ (120 men, 20 guns).\r\n\r\n\r\nDEIGLE, RICHARD.\r\n\r\nAn Elizabethan pirate. Wrecked in the _John of Sandwich_ at Alderney in\r\n1564, when he was arrested, but escaped in a small boat.\r\n\r\n\r\nDELANDER, CAPTAIN. Buccaneer.\r\n\r\nCommanded a _chatas_, or small coasting craft. He was sent by Morgan ahead\r\nof the main body when, in January, 1671, he marched from San Lorenzo on\r\nhis great assault on Panama.\r\n\r\n\r\nDELIZUFF. Barbary corsair.\r\n\r\nIn 1553, while Barbarossa was sailing from Algiers to Constantinople, he\r\nwas joined by Delizuff with a fleet of eighteen pirate vessels.\r\n\r\nDelizuff was killed in an affair at the Island of Biba, and, the crews of\r\nthe two corsairs quarrelling, the ships of Delizuff stole away one dark\r\nnight.\r\n\r\n\r\nDELVE, JONATHAN.\r\n\r\nOne of Captain Lowther's crew in the _Happy Delivery_. Was hanged at St.\r\nKitts in 1722.\r\n\r\n\r\nDEMPSTER, CAPTAIN. Buccaneer.\r\n\r\nIn 1668 he was in command of several vessels and 300 men, blockading\r\nHavana.\r\n\r\n\r\nDENNIS, HENRY.\r\n\r\nOf Bideford in Devonshire.\r\n\r\nAt first a pirate with Captain Davis, he afterwards joined Captain\r\nRoberts's crew. Was tried for piracy at Cape Coast Castle in 1722, and\r\nfound guilty, but for some reason was reprieved and sold for seven years\r\nto serve the Royal African Company on their plantations.\r\n\r\n\r\nDERDRAKE, CAPTAIN JOHN, _alias_ JACK OF THE BALTIC. A Danish pirate, of\r\nCopenhagen.\r\n\r\nWhen a carpenter in the King's Dockyard at Copenhagen he was dismissed for\r\ndrunkenness. After making a few voyages to London as a ship's carpenter,\r\nhis parents died and left their son a fortune of 10,000 rix-dollars. With\r\nthis money Derdrake built himself a fast sailing brig sheathed with\r\ncopper, and for a while traded in wood between Norway and London. Becoming\r\nimpatient of the smallness of the profits in this trade, he offered his\r\nservices and ship to Peter the Great. This monarch, as was his custom,\r\nexamined the ship in person, and, approving of her, bought her, and at the\r\nsame time appointed Derdrake to be a master shipwright in the royal\r\ndockyards on the Neva. The carpenter, always a man of violent temper, one\r\nday quarrelled with one of his superiors, seized an axe, and slew him. His\r\nship then happening to be in the roads, Derdrake hurried on board her and\r\nmade sail, and went off with the cargo, which he sold in London. Arming\r\nhis vessel with twelve guns, he sailed for Norway, but on the way he was\r\nattacked by a big Russian man-of-war. The Russian was defeated and\r\nsurrendered, and Derdrake went into her in place of his own smaller ship,\r\ngiving his new craft the ominous name of the _Sudden Death_. With a fine,\r\nwell-armed ship and a crew of seventy desperadoes, one-half English, and\r\nthe rest Norwegian and Danish, he now definitely turned pirate. Lying in\r\nwait for English and Russian ships carrying goods to Peter the Great, the\r\npirates took many valuable prizes, with cargoes consisting of fittings for\r\nships, arms, and warm woollen clothing. For these he found a ready market\r\nin Sweden, where no questions were asked and \"cash on delivery\" was the\r\nrule.\r\n\r\nDerdrake drowned all his prisoners, and was one of the very few pirates,\r\nother than those found in works of fiction, who forced his victims to\r\n\"walk the plank.\" Not long afterwards the pirates met with and fought an\r\narmed Swedish vessel, which was defeated, but the captain and crew escaped\r\nin the long-boat, and, getting to shore, spread the tidings of the\r\npirates' doings. On hearing the news, the Governor of St. Petersburg,\r\nGeneral Shevelling, sent out two ships to search for and take the pirates,\r\noffering a reward of 4,000 rix-dollars for Derdrake's head. The pirates\r\nhad just heard of this when they happened to take a Russian vessel bound\r\nfor Cronstadt, on board of which was a passenger, a sister of the very\r\nGeneral Shevelling. This poor lady, after being reproached by the pirates\r\nfor her brother's doings, was stabbed to death in the back by Derdrake. At\r\nthis time there was aboard the _Sudden Death_ a Danish sailor, who, having\r\nbeen severely flogged for being drunk at sea, shammed sickness and\r\npretended to have lost the use of his limbs. The captain was deceived, and\r\nsent the sailor, well supplied with money, to a country house at Drontheim\r\nin Sweden, to recover. No sooner had Jack of the Baltic left than the\r\nDanish sailor set off post-haste for St. Petersburg, where he saw the\r\nGovernor and told him of his sister's murder, and also that the pirates\r\nwere to be found at Strothing in Sweden. Two well-armed vessels were\r\nimmediately despatched, which, finding the _Sudden Death_ at anchor,\r\nfought and sunk her, though unfortunately Derdrake was on shore and so\r\nescaped; but the whole crew were hung up alive by hooks fixed in their\r\nribs and sent to drift down the Volga. Derdrake, who had a large sum of\r\nmoney with him, bought an estate near Stralsund, and lived there in luxury\r\nfor fourteen years, until one day, a servant having robbed him of a sum of\r\nmoney, Derdrake followed him to Stockholm, where he was recognized by the\r\ncaptain of the Swedish ship who had first given information against him,\r\nand the pirate was at once arrested, tried, and hanged.\r\n\r\n\r\nDEW, CAPTAIN GEORGE.\r\n\r\nOf Bermuda.\r\n\r\nHe commanded a Bermuda ship and sailed in company with Captain Tew, when\r\nthey were caught in a storm off that island, and Captain Dew, having\r\nsprung his mast, was compelled to put back to the island for repairs.\r\nCaptain Tew continued his journey to Africa, but what became of Captain\r\nDew is not known.\r\n\r\n\r\nDIABOLITO.\r\n\r\nA Central American pirate who became very famous in the early part of the\r\nlast century. Commanded the _Catalina_ in 1823 off the coast of Cuba.\r\n\r\n\r\nDIEGO, or DIEGO GRILLO.\r\n\r\nA mulatto of Havana.\r\n\r\nAfter the general amnesty to pirates, given in 1670, Diego, Thurston, and\r\nothers continued to attack Spanish ships and to carry their prizes to\r\ntheir lair at Tortuga Island. Diego commanded a vessel carrying fifteen\r\nguns. He succeeded in defeating three armed ships in the Bahama Channel,\r\nwhich had been sent to take him, and he massacred all the Spaniards of\r\nEuropean birth that he found among the crews. He was caught in 1673 and\r\nhanged.\r\n\r\n\r\nDIPPER, HENRY.\r\n\r\nOne of the English soldiers who deserted from the Fort Loyal, Falmouth,\r\nMaine, and joined Captain Pound, the pirate. Killed in the fight at\r\nTarpaulin Cove in 1689.\r\n\r\n\r\nDOLE, FRANCIS.\r\n\r\nWas one of Hore's crew. Lived with his wife, when not \"on the account,\" at\r\nhis house at Charleston, near Boston. The pirate Gillam was found hiding\r\nthere by the Governor's search-party on the night of November 11th, 1699.\r\nDole was committed to gaol at Boston.\r\n\r\n\r\nDOROTHY, JOHN.\r\n\r\nOne of Captain John Quelch's crew. Tried for piracy at Boston in June,\r\n1704.\r\n\r\n\r\nDOVER, DOCTOR THOMAS.\r\n\r\nBorn 1660; died 1742.\r\n\r\nThis many-sided character was educated at Caius College, Cambridge, where\r\nhe took the degree of Bachelor of Medicine. Many years afterwards, in\r\n1721, the Royal College of Physicians made him a licentiate. For many\r\nyears Dover practised as a physician at Bristol, until the year 1708, when\r\nhe sailed from Bristol as \"second captain\" to Captain Woodes Rogers, with\r\nthe _Duke_ and the _Duchess_, two privateer ships fitted out for a South\r\nSea cruise by some Bristol merchants. Dover had no knowledge whatever of\r\nnavigation, but, having a considerable share in the adventure, he insisted\r\non being given a command. Sailing round the Horn, the two ships arrived,\r\non the night of February 1st, 1709, off the Island of Juan Fernandez,\r\nwhere they observed a light. Next morning Dover went ashore in a boat, to\r\nfind and rescue the solitary inhabitant of the island, Alexander Selkirk,\r\nthe original of Robinson Crusoe. Sailing north, a Spanish ship was taken\r\nand rechristened the _Bachelor_, and Dover was put in command of her. He\r\nsacked Guayaquil in April, 1709, many of the crew contracting plague from\r\nsleeping in a church where some bodies had recently been buried. Dover\r\nundertook to treat the sick with most heroic measures, bleeding each sick\r\nman and drawing off 100 ounces of blood.\r\n\r\nHe also took the famous _Acapulco_ ship, with a booty worth more than a\r\nmillion pounds sterling. Dover returned to Bristol in October, 1711, with\r\na prize of great value, after sailing round the world.\r\n\r\nGiving up piracy, he settled in practice in London, seeing his patients\r\ndaily at the Jerusalem Coffee-house in Cecil Street, Strand. He wrote a\r\nbook called \"The Ancient Physician's Legacy to His Country,\" which ran\r\ninto seven or eight editions, in which he strongly recommended the\r\nadministration of large doses of quicksilver for almost every malady that\r\nman is subject to. This book won him the nickname of the \"Quicksilver\r\nDoctor.\" He invented a diaphoretic powder containing ipecacuanha and\r\nopium, which is used to this day, and is still known as Dover's powder.\r\n\r\nDover died at the age of 82, in the year 1742, and should always be\r\nremembered for having invented Dover's powders, commanded a company of\r\nMarines, rescued Alexander Selkirk, written a most extraordinary medical\r\nbook, and for having been a successful pirate captain.\r\n\r\n\r\nDOWLING, CAPTAIN WILLIAM.\r\n\r\nOf New Providence, Bahamas.\r\n\r\nHanged for piracy in the early part of the eighteenth century.\r\n\r\n\r\nDRAGUT. Barbary corsair.\r\n\r\nStarted life as a pirate, and was eventually put in command of twelve\r\nlarge galleys by Kheyr-ed-din. Pillaged and burnt many towns on the\r\nItalian coast, and destroyed ships without number. Was taken prisoner by\r\nthe younger Doria, and condemned to row in the galleys for four years\r\nuntil ransomed for 3,000 ducats by Kheyr-ed-din. Appointed Admiral of the\r\nOttoman Fleet. Ended a bloodthirsty but very successful career in 1565 by\r\nbeing killed at the Siege of Malta.\r\n\r\n\r\nDRAKE, SIR FRANCIS.\r\n\r\nBorn about 1540.\r\n\r\nThe life of the famous Admiral is too well known to require more than a\r\nbare notice in these pages. Although the Spaniards called him \"the\r\nPirate,\" he was more strictly a buccaneer in his early voyages, when he\r\nsailed with the sole object of spoiling the Spaniards. His first command\r\nwas the _Judith_, in John Hawkins's unfortunate expedition in 1567. Drake\r\nmade several voyages from Plymouth to the West Indies and the Spanish\r\nMain.\r\n\r\nIn 1572 he burnt Porto Bello, and a year later sacked Vera Cruz. He served\r\nwith the English Army in Ireland under Lord Essex in 1574 and 1575. In\r\n1578 he sailed through the Straits of Magellan, plundered Valparaiso, and\r\nalso captured a great treasure ship from Acapulco. Sailing from America,\r\nhe crossed the Pacific Ocean, passed through the Indian Archipelago,\r\nrounded the Cape of Good Hope, and arrived at Deptford in England in 1581.\r\nAt the conclusion of this voyage he was knighted by Queen Elizabeth, being\r\nthe first Englishman to sail round the world. Drake's voyages after this\r\nwere sailed under commission and letters of marque, and so lose any stigma\r\nof being buccaneering adventures.\r\n\r\nDrake died at Porto Bello in the year 1596.\r\n\r\n\r\nDROMYOWE, PETER. A Breton pirate.\r\n\r\nOne of the crew of Captain du Laerquerac, who in 1537 took several English\r\nships in the Bristol Channel.\r\n\r\n\r\nDRUMMOND, _alias_ TEACH, THATCH, or BLACKBEARD.\r\n\r\n\r\nDUNBAR, NICHOLAS. Pirate.\r\n\r\nOne of the crew of the brigantine _Charles_ (Captain Quelch). Tried for\r\npiracy at Boston in 1704.\r\n\r\n\r\nDUNKIN, GEORGE.\r\n\r\nOf Glasgow.\r\n\r\nOne of Major Stede Bonnet's crew. Hanged at Charleston, South Carolina, in\r\nNovember, 1718. Buried in the marsh below low-water mark.\r\n\r\n\r\nDUNN, WILLIAM.\r\n\r\nOne of Captain Pound's crew.\r\n\r\n\r\nDUNTON, CAPTAIN.\r\n\r\nA citizen of London, taken prisoner by the Sallee pirates in 1636. Being a\r\ngood navigator and seaman, and the Moorish pirates being as yet\r\ninexperienced in the management of sailing ships, Dunton was put into a\r\nSallee ship as pilot and master, with a crew of twenty-one Moors and five\r\nFlemish renegadoes. He was ordered to go to the English coast to capture\r\nChristian prisoners. When off Hurst Castle, near the Needles in the Isle\r\nof Wight, his ship was seized and the crew carried to Winchester to stand\r\ntheir trial for piracy. Dunton was acquitted, but he never saw his little\r\nson of 10 years old, as he was still a slave in Algiers.\r\n\r\n\r\nEASTON, CAPTAIN.\r\n\r\nJoined the Barbary pirates in the sixteenth century, succeeding so well as\r\nto become, according to John Smith, the Virginian, a \"Marquesse in Savoy,\"\r\nwhatever that may have been.\r\n\r\n\r\nEASTON, CAPTAIN PETER.\r\n\r\nOne of the most notorious of the English pirates during the reign of James\r\nI.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1611 he had forty vessels under his command. The next year he\r\nwas on the Newfoundland coast, where he plundered the shipping and fishing\r\nsettlements, stealing provisions and munitions, as well as inducing one\r\nhundred men to join his fleet.\r\n\r\nA year later, in 1613, he appears to have joined the English pirates who\r\nhad established themselves at Mamora on the Barbary coast.\r\n\r\n\r\nEATON, EDWARD.\r\n\r\nOf Wrexham in Wales.\r\n\r\nOne of Captain Harris's crew. Hanged at Newport, Rhode Island, on July\r\n19th, 1723. Age 38.\r\n\r\n\r\nECHLIN.\r\n\r\nAn English pirate, of the _Two Brothers_, a Rhode Island built vessel,\r\ncommanded in 1730 by a one-armed English pirate called Captain Johnson.\r\n\r\n\r\nEDDY, WILLIAM.\r\n\r\nOf Aberdeen.\r\n\r\nOne of Major Stede Bonnet's crew. Hanged at White Point, Charleston, South\r\nCarolina, on November 8th, 1718, and buried in the marsh below low-water\r\nmark.\r\n\r\n\r\nENGLAND, CAPTAIN.\r\n\r\nSailing in 1718 as mate in a sloop from Jamaica, he was taken prisoner by\r\nthe pirate Captain Winter. England joined the pirates, and was given the\r\ncommand of a vessel. In this ship he sailed to the coast of West Africa,\r\nand the first prize he took was the _Cadogan_ snow (Captain Skinner), at\r\nSierra Leone. Some of England's crew knew Skinner, having served in his\r\nship, and, owing to some quarrel, had been handed over to a man-of-war,\r\nand deprived of the wages due to them. These men afterwards deserted the\r\nman-of-war and joined the pirates. On Captain Skinner coming aboard\r\nEngland's ship, these men took him and bound him to the windlass, and then\r\npelted him with glass bottles, after which they whipped him up and down\r\nthe deck, eventually one of them shooting him through the head. This\r\nbrutal treatment was none of England's doing, who was generally kind to\r\nhis prisoners.\r\n\r\nEngland's next prize was the _Pearl_, which he exchanged for his own\r\nsloop; fitted her up for the \"pyratical Account,\" and christened her the\r\n_Royal James_. Captain England was most successful, taking a number of\r\nprizes, which he plundered. One ship he captured so took the eye of\r\nEngland that he fitted her up and changed into her, naming her the\r\n_Victory_. This he did in the harbour at Whydah, where he met with another\r\npirate, called la Bouche. The two pirates and their crews spent a holiday\r\nat this place where, according to the well-informed Captain Johnson, \"they\r\nliv'd very wantonly for several Weeks, making free with the Negroe Women\r\nand committing such outrageous Acts, that they came to an open Rupture\r\nwith the Natives, several of whom they kill'd and one of their Towns they\r\nset on Fire.\" Leaving here, no doubt to the great relief of the negroes,\r\nit was put to the vote of the crew to decide where they should go, and the\r\nmajority were for visiting the East Indies. Rounding the Cape of Good\r\nHope, they arrived at Madagascar early in 1720, where they only stopped\r\nfor water and provisions, and then sailed to the coast of Malabar in\r\nIndia. Here they took several country ships, and one Dutch one, but soon\r\nreturned to Madagascar, where they went on shore, living in tents, and\r\nhunting hogs and deer. While on this island they looked for Captain\r\nAvery's crew, but failed to discover them. While the pirates were here\r\nthey managed to take a ship commanded by a Captain Mackra, but not without\r\na desperate fight. The pirates were for killing Mackra, but, owing to the\r\nefforts of Captain England, he managed to escape.\r\n\r\nThe pirates had several times complained of the weakness, or humanity, of\r\ntheir commander towards his prisoners, and they now turned him out and\r\nelected a new captain, and marooned England and three others on the\r\nIsland of Mauritius. The captain and his companions set about building a\r\nsmall boat of some old staves and pieces of deal they found washed up on\r\nthe beach. When finished they sailed to Madagascar, where, when last heard\r\nof, they were living on the charity of some other pirates.\r\n\r\n\r\nERNADOS, EMANUEL.\r\n\r\nA Carolina pirate who was hanged at Charleston in 1717.\r\n\r\n\r\nESMIT, ADOLF.\r\n\r\nA Danish buccaneer, who afterwards became Governor of the Danish island of\r\nSt. Thomas, one of the Virgin Islands. The population of this island\r\nconsisted of some 350 persons, most of whom were English. Esmit did all he\r\ncould to assist the pirates, paid to fit out their ships for them, gave\r\nsanctuary to runaway servants, seamen, and debtors, and refused to restore\r\ncaptured vessels. Adolf had taken advantage of his popularity with the\r\ninhabitants to turn out his brother, who was the rightful Governor\r\nappointed by the Danish Government.\r\n\r\n\r\nESSEX, CAPTAIN CORNELIUS. Buccaneer.\r\n\r\nIn December, 1679, he met with several other well-known buccaneers in four\r\nbarques and two sloops at Point Morant, and on January 7th set sail for\r\nPorto Bello. The fleet was scattered by a terrible storm, but eventually\r\nthey all arrived at the rendezvous. Some 300 men went in canoes and landed\r\nabout twenty leagues from the town of Porto Bello, and marched for four\r\ndays along the sea-coast.\r\n\r\nThe buccaneers, \"many of them were weak, being three days without any\r\nfood, and their feet cut with the rocks for want of shoes,\" entered the\r\ntown on February 17th, 1680. The buccaneers, with prisoners and spoil,\r\nleft the town just in time, for a party of 700 Spanish soldiers was near\r\nat hand coming to the rescue. The share to each man came to one hundred\r\npieces of eight. In 1679 Essex was brought a prisoner by a frigate, the\r\n_Hunter_, to Port Royal, and tried with some twenty of his crew for\r\nplundering on the Jamaican coast. Essex was acquitted, but two of his crew\r\nwere hanged.\r\n\r\n\r\nEUCALLA, DOMINGO.\r\n\r\nA negro. Hanged at Kingston, Jamaica, on February 7th, 1823. Made a moving\r\nharangue to the spectators from the gallows, ending with a prayer. Of the\r\nten pirates executed this day, Eucalla showed the greatest courage.\r\n\r\n\r\nEVANS, CAPTAIN JOHN. Welsh pirate.\r\n\r\nWas master of a sloop belonging to the Island of Nevis. Afterwards being\r\nin Jamaica and out of employment, and berths being scarce, he decided to\r\ngo \"on the account,\" and in September, 1722, rowed out of Port Royal in a\r\ncanoe with a few chosen companions. They began piracy in a small way, by\r\npaddling along the coast and landing at night to break into a house or two\r\nand robbing these of anything they could carry away.\r\n\r\nAt last at Dun's Hole they found what they were looking for, a small\r\nBermuda sloop lying at anchor. Evans stepped aboard and informed the crew\r\nof the sloop that he was captain of their vessel, \"which was a piece of\r\nnews they knew not before.\" Going on shore, Evans stood treat to his crew\r\nat the village inn, spending three pistols on liquid refreshment. He so\r\ntook the fancy of the publican by his open-handed ways that he was invited\r\nto call again. This Evans and his companions did, in the middle of the\r\nsame night, and rifled the house and took away all they could carry\r\naboard their sloop.\r\n\r\nMounting four guns and christening their little vessel the _Scowerer_,\r\nthey set sail for Hispaniola. Good luck immediately followed, as on the\r\nvery next day they took their first prize, a Spanish sloop, an\r\nextraordinarily rich prize for her size, for the crew were able to share a\r\nsum of £150 a man. For a while all was _coleur de rose_, prize after prize\r\nsimply falling into their hands. But an unhappy accident was soon to bring\r\nan end to Evans's career. The boatswain was a noisy, surly fellow, and on\r\nseveral occasions the captain had words with him about his disrespectful\r\nbehaviour. The boatswain on one of these occasions so far forgot himself\r\nas not only to use ill language to his captain but to challenge him to a\r\nfight on the next shore they came to with pistol and sword. On reaching\r\nland the cowardly boatswain refused to go ashore or to fight, whereupon\r\nthe captain took his cane and gave him a hearty drubbing, when the\r\nboatswain, all of a sudden drawing a pistol, shot Evans through the head,\r\nso that he fell down dead. Thus was brought to a tragic and sudden end a\r\ncareer that showed early signs of great promise. The boatswain jumped\r\noverboard and swam for the shore, but a boat put off and brought him back\r\nto the vessel. A trial was at once held, but the chief gunner, unable to\r\nbear with the slow legal procedure any further, stepped forward and shot\r\nthe prisoner dead.\r\n\r\nThe crew of thirty men now shared their plunder of some £9,000 and broke\r\nup, each going his own way.\r\n\r\n\r\nEVERSON, CAPTAIN JACOB, _alias_ JACOBS.\r\n\r\nIn January, 1681, Sir Henry Morgan, then Lieutenant-Governor of Jamaica,\r\nreceived information that a famous Dutch buccaneer, Everson, was anchored\r\noff the coast in an armed sloop, in company with a brigantine which he had\r\nlately captured. This was more than the ex-pirate Governor could tolerate,\r\nso he at once set out in a small vessel with fifty picked men. The sloop\r\nwas boarded at midnight, but Everson and a few others escaped by leaping\r\noverboard and swimming to the shore. Most of the prisoners were\r\nEnglishmen, and were convicted of piracy and hanged.\r\n\r\n\r\nEXQUEMELIN, ALEXANDER OLIVIER, or ESQUEMELING in English, OEXMELIN in\r\nFrench. Buccaneer.\r\n\r\nA surgeon with the most famous buccaneers, Exquemelin will always be known\r\nas the historian who recorded the deeds of the buccaneers in his classic\r\nbook, \"Bucaniers of America, or a true account of the assaults committed\r\nupon the coasts of the West Indies, etc.,\" published by W. Cooke, London,\r\n1684. This book was first published in Dutch at Amsterdam in 1678, then in\r\nGerman in 1679, in Spanish in 1681. Since then almost innumerable editions\r\nand reprints have appeared.\r\n\r\nThe author was a Fleming, who arrived at Tortuga Island in 1666 as an\r\nengagé of the French West India Company. After serving for three years\r\nunder an inhuman master he became so ill that he was sold cheaply to a\r\nsurgeon. By the kind treatment of his new master Exquemelin soon regained\r\nhis health, and at the same time picked up the rudiments of the craft of\r\nbarber surgeon. He was in all the great exploits of the buccaneers, and\r\nwrites a clear, entertaining, and apparently perfectly accurate first-hand\r\naccount of these adventures. He returned to Europe in 1674, and shortly\r\nafterwards published his book.\r\n\r\n\r\nFALL, JOHN.\r\n\r\nThis buccaneer was one of Captain Sharp's crew. On the death of John\r\nHilliard, the ship's master, Fall was promoted to the larboard watch.\r\nNothing further is known of this man.\r\n\r\n\r\nFARRINGTON, THOMAS.\r\n\r\nOne of John Quelch's crew on the brigantine _Charles_. Tried for piracy at\r\nBoston in June, 1704, at the Star Tavern.\r\n\r\n\r\nFENN, CAPTAIN JOHN.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1721 Captain Anstis took prize a stout ship, the _Morning\r\nStar_, bound from Guiney to Carolina. This ship the pirates armed with\r\nthirty-two pieces of cannon, manned her with a crew of one hundred men,\r\nand placed Fenn in command, who had until then been gunner in Anstis's\r\nship, the _Good Fortune_. Fenn was a one-handed man. By carelessness, or\r\nperhaps because of Fenn only having one hand, the _Morning Star_ was run\r\non to a reef in the Grand Caymans and lost. Fenn and a few others had just\r\nbeen taken on board by his consort when two King's ships arrived, and the\r\n_Good Fortune_ barely escaped capture.\r\n\r\nFenn was soon given another ship, one armed with twenty-four guns. In\r\nApril, 1723, while cleaning their ship at the Island of Tobago, they were\r\nsuddenly surprised by the arrival of a man-of-war, the _Winchelsea_.\r\nSetting fire to their ship, the crew ran to hide in the woods. Fenn was\r\ncaught a few days later struggling through the jungle with his gunner.\r\n\r\n\r\nFERDINANDO, LEWIS.\r\n\r\nIn 1699 he captured a sloop belonging to Samuel Salters, of Bermuda.\r\n\r\n\r\nFERN, THOMAS.\r\n\r\nA Newfoundland fish-splitter.\r\n\r\nIn August, 1723, joined with John Phillips in stealing a small vessel,\r\nwhich they called the _Revenge_, and went \"on the account.\" Fern was\r\nappointed carpenter. Fern gave trouble afterwards over the promotion of a\r\nprisoner, an old pirate called Rose Archer, to the rank of quartermaster.\r\n\r\nLater on Fern headed a mutiny and attempted to sail off on his own in one\r\nof the prize vessels. He was caught, brought back, and forgiven, but on\r\nattempting to run away a second time, Captain Phillips killed him,\r\n\"pursuant to the pirates articles.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nFERNON, WILLIAM.\r\n\r\nA Somersetshire man.\r\n\r\nTaken from a Newfoundland ship, he became a seaman aboard Bartholomew\r\nRoberts's _Royal Fortune_. Died at the age of 22.\r\n\r\n\r\nFIFE, CAPTAIN JAMES.\r\n\r\nSurrendered to Governor Woodes Rogers at New Providence Island, Bahamas,\r\nin June, 1718, and received the royal pardon to pirates. Was afterwards\r\nkilled by his own crew.\r\n\r\n\r\nFILLMORE, JOHN.\r\n\r\nA fisherman of Ipswich.\r\n\r\nTaken out of the _Dolphin_ when fishing for cod off the Banks of\r\nNewfoundland in 1724 by the pirate Captain Phillips, and forced to join\r\nthe pirates. Having no other means of escape he, with two others, suddenly\r\nkilled Phillips and two more pirates and brought the vessel into Boston\r\nHarbour. Millard Fillmore, thirteenth President of the United States, was\r\nthe great grandson of John Fillmore.\r\n\r\n\r\nFITZERRALD, JOHN.\r\n\r\nOf Limerick.\r\n\r\nThis Irish pirate was hanged at Newport, Rhode Island, in 1723, at the age\r\nof 21.\r\n\r\n\r\nFLEMING, CAPTAIN. Pirate.\r\n\r\nThis notorious Elizabethan pirate did his country a great service by\r\nbringing to Plymouth the first tidings of the approach of the Spanish\r\nArmada in 1585.\r\n\r\nTo quote John Smith, the great Elizabethan traveller and the founder of\r\nthe colony of Virginia, \"Fleming was an expert and as much sought for as\r\nany pirate of the Queen's reign, yet such a friend to his Country, that\r\ndiscovering the Spanish Armada, he voluntarily came to Plymouth, yielded\r\nhimself freely to my Lord Admirall, and gave him notice of the Spaniards\r\ncoming: which good warning came so happily and unexpectedly, that he had\r\nhis pardon, and a good reward.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nFLETCHER, JOHN.\r\n\r\nOf Edinburgh.\r\n\r\nTried at Newport, Rhode Island, for piracy in 1723, found \"not guilty.\"\r\nHis age was only 17 years.\r\n\r\n\r\nFLY, CAPTAIN WILLIAM. Pirate and prizefighter.\r\n\r\nHe was boatswain in the _Elizabeth_, of Bristol, in 1726, bound for\r\nGuinea. Heading a mutiny on May 27th, he tossed the captain over the\r\nship's side, and slaughtered all the officers except the ship's surgeon.\r\nFly was unanimously elected captain by the crew. His first prize was the\r\n_John and Hannah_ off the coast of North Carolina. The next the _John and\r\nBetty_, Captain Gale, from Bardadoes to Guinea. After taking several other\r\nvessels, he cruised off the coast of Newfoundland where he took a whaler.\r\nFly was caught by a piece of strategy on the part of the whaler captain,\r\nwho carried him and his crew in chains in their own ship to Great\r\nBrewster, Massachusetts, in June, 1726. On July 4th Fly and the other\r\npirates were brought to trial at Boston, and on the 16th were executed. On\r\nthe day of execution Fly refused to go to church before the hanging to\r\nlisten to a sermon by Dr. Coleman. On the way to the gallows he bore\r\nhimself with great bravado, jumping briskly into the cart with a nosegay\r\nin his hands bedecked with coloured ribbons like a prizefighter, smiling\r\nand bowing to the spectators. He was hanged in chains at Nix's Mate, a\r\nsmall island in Boston Harbour, and thus was brought to a close a brief\r\nthough brilliant piratical career of just one month.\r\n\r\n\r\nFORREST, WILLIAM.\r\n\r\nOne of the mutinous crew of the _Antonio_ hanged at Boston in 1672.\r\n\r\n\r\nFORSEITH, EDWARD.\r\n\r\nOne of Captain Avery's crew. Hanged at Execution Dock, 1696.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOSTER. Buccaneer and poet.\r\n\r\nOnly two facts are known about this adventurer. One is that he was\r\nreproved on a certain occasion by Morgan (who thought nothing of torturing\r\nhis captives) for \"harshness\" to his prisoners, and the other that he\r\nwrote sentimental verse, particularly one work entitled \"Sonneyettes of\r\nLove.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nFRANKLYN, CHARLES.\r\n\r\nThis Welsh pirate was a Monmouthshire man, and one of Captain Howel\r\nDavis's crew. While at the Cape Verde Islands, Franklyn \"was so charmed\r\nwith the luxuries of the place and the free conversation of the Women,\"\r\nthat he married and settled down there.\r\n\r\n\r\nFREEBARN, MATTHEW.\r\n\r\nOne of Captain Lowther's crew. Hanged at St. Kitts on March 11th, 1722.\r\n\r\n\r\nFROGGE, WILLIAM. Buccaneer.\r\n\r\nWas with Morgan in his attacks on Porto Bello and Panama in 1670. He kept\r\na diary of the chief events of these exploits, and distinctly states that\r\nthe Spaniards, and not Morgan, set fire to the city. But he was greatly\r\nenraged against Morgan for cheating the buccaneers out of their plunder,\r\nand giving each man only about £10 as his share.\r\n\r\n\r\nFULWORTH, MRS. ANNE.\r\n\r\nThis lady accompanied Anne Bonny to New Providence Island from Carolina in\r\nthe guise of her mother. When Captain Rackam and Anne Bonny were\r\nintriguing to run away from the latter's husband, \"a pardoned pirate, a\r\nlikely young fellow and of a sober life,\" Mrs. Fulworth offered sympathy\r\nand advice to the lovers. The scandal being brought to the ears of\r\nGovernor Woodes Rogers by a pirate called Richard Turnley, he sent for the\r\ntwo ladies, \"and examining them both upon it, and finding they could not\r\ndeny it, he threaten'd, if they proceeded further in it, to commit them\r\nboth to Prison, and order them to be whipp'd, and that Rackam, himself,\r\nshould be their Executioner.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nGARCIA.\r\n\r\nOne of Gilbert's crew in the _Panda_. Hanged at Boston in June, 1835.\r\n\r\n\r\nGARDINER.\r\n\r\nAlthough at one time a pirate, by some means or other he became appointed\r\nto the office of Deputy Collector at Boston in 1699. Accepted a bribe of\r\nstolen gold from the pirate Gillam, which caused some gossip in the town.\r\n\r\n\r\nGASPAR, CAPTAIN JOSÉ, _alias_ \"GASPARILLA\" or \"RICHARD COEUR DE LION.\"\r\n\r\nWas an officer of high rank in the Spanish Navy till 1782, when, having\r\nbeen detected in stealing some jewels belonging to the Crown, he stole a\r\nship and turned pirate. Settling at Charlotte Harbour, he built a fort,\r\nwhere he kept his female prisoners, all the male ones being killed. Here\r\nhe lived in regal state as king of the pirates, on Gasparilla Island. In\r\n1801 he took a big Spanish ship forty miles from Boca Grande, killed the\r\ncrew, and took a quantity of gold and twelve young ladies. One of these\r\nwas a Spanish princess, whom he kept for himself; the eleven Mexican girls\r\nhe gave to his crew.\r\n\r\nGaspar was described as having polished manners and a great love of\r\nfashionable clothes, and being fearless in fight; but in spite of all\r\nthese attractive qualities, the little Spanish princess would have none of\r\nhim, and was murdered.\r\n\r\nBy the year 1821 the United States Government had made matters so hot for\r\nGaspar that the pirate kingdom was broken up and their booty of 30,000,000\r\ndollars divided.\r\n\r\nAs he was about to sail away, a big ship came into the bay, apparently an\r\nEnglish merchantman. Gaspar at once prepared to attack her, when she ran\r\nup the Stars and Stripes, proving herself to be a heavily armed American\r\nman-of-war. The pirate ship was defeated, and Gaspar, winding a piece of\r\nanchor chain round his waist, jumped overboard and was drowned, his age\r\nbeing 65.\r\n\r\n\r\nGATES, THOMAS.\r\n\r\nHanged in Virginia in 1718 with the rest of Captain Edward Teach's crew.\r\n\r\n\r\nGAUTIER, FRANÇOIS, or GAUTIEZ, _alias_ GEORGE SADWELL.\r\n\r\nNative of Havre.\r\n\r\nCook on board the _Jane_ schooner, commanded by Captain Thomas Johnson.\r\nWhile on a voyage from Gibraltar to Brazil with a valuable cargo, Gautier\r\nand the mate killed the captain and the helmsman and steered the vessel to\r\nScotland, sinking her near Stornoway. Caught and tried at Edinburgh in\r\nNovember, 1821, found guilty, and hanged in January on the sands of Leith,\r\nhis body being publicly dissected afterwards by the Professor of Anatomy\r\nto Edinburgh University. The age of this French pirate at his death was\r\n23.\r\n\r\n\r\nGAYNY, GEORGE, or GAINY.\r\n\r\nOne of Wafer's little party lost in the jungle of Darien in 1681. In\r\nattempting to swim across a swollen river with a line, he got into\r\ndifficulties, became entangled in the line which was tied round his neck,\r\nand having also a bag containing 300 Spanish silver dollars on his back,\r\nhe sank and was swept away. Some time afterwards Wafer found Gayny lying\r\ndead in a creek with the rope twisted about him and his money at his neck.\r\n\r\n\r\nGENNINGS, CAPTAIN.\r\n\r\nA renegade English pirate who joined the Barbary corsairs, turned\r\nMohammedan, and commanded a Moorish pirate vessel. Taken prisoner off the\r\nIrish coast, he was brought to London and hanged at Wapping.\r\n\r\n\r\nGERRARD, THOMAS.\r\n\r\nOf the Island of Antigua.\r\n\r\nOne of Major Bonnet's crew of the _Royal James_. Tried for piracy at\r\nCharleston in 1718, but found \"not guilty.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nGIBBENS, GARRAT.\r\n\r\nBoatswain on board the _Queen Ann's Revenge_. Was killed at the same time\r\nas Captain Teach.\r\n\r\n\r\nGIBBS, CHARLES.\r\n\r\nBorn at Rhode Island in 1794, he was brought up on a farm there. Ran away\r\nto sea in the United States sloop-of-war _Harriet_. Was in action off\r\nPernambuco against H.M.S. _Peacock_, afterwards serving with credit on\r\nboard the _Chesapeake_ in her famous fight with the _Shannon_; but after\r\nhis release from Dartmoor as a prisoner of war he opened a grocery shop in\r\nAnn Street, called the \"Tin Pot,\" \"a place full of abandoned women and\r\ndissolute fellows.\" Drinking up all the profits, he was compelled to go to\r\nsea again, and got a berth on a South American privateer. Gibbs led a\r\nmutiny, seized the ship and turned her into a pirate, and cruised about in\r\nthe neighbourhood of Havana, plundering merchant vessels along the coast\r\nof Cuba. He slaughtered the crews of all the ships he took. In 1819\r\nreturned to private life in New York with 30,000 dollars in gold. Taking a\r\npleasure trip to Liverpool, he was entrapped by a designing female and\r\nlost all his money.\r\n\r\nIn 1830 he took to piracy once more and shipped as a seaman in the brig\r\n_Vineyard_ (Captain W. Thornby), New Orleans to Philadelphia, with a cargo\r\nof cotton, molasses, and 54,000 dollars in specie.\r\n\r\nGibbs again brought about a mutiny, murdering the captain and mate. After\r\nsetting fire to and scuttling the ship, the crew took to their boats,\r\nlanding at Barrow Island, where they buried their money in the sand.\r\n\r\nHe was hanged at New York as recently as 1831.\r\n\r\n\r\nGIDDENS, PAUL.\r\n\r\nOne of Captain Quelch's crew. Tried at Boston in 1704.\r\n\r\n\r\nGIDDINGS, JOHN.\r\n\r\nOf York River, Virginia.\r\n\r\nOne of Captain Pound's crew. Wounded and taken prisoner at Tarpaulin Cove\r\nin 1689.\r\n\r\n\r\nGILBERT, CAPTAIN.\r\n\r\nCommanded the schooner _Panda_. On September 20th, 1832, he took and\r\nplundered a Salem brig, the _Mexican_, on her way from Salem to Rio de\r\nJaneiro. A few months later Gilbert and his crew were captured by Captain\r\nTrotter, of H.M. brig-of-war _Curlew_, and taken as prisoners to Salem and\r\nhanded over to the United States authorities. Tried at Boston in December,\r\n1834. Hanged at the same place on June 11th, 1835. This was the last act\r\nof piracy committed upon the Atlantic Ocean.\r\n\r\n\r\nGILLAM, CAPTAIN JAMES, _alias_ KELLY.\r\n\r\nA notorious pirate. When serving on board the East Indiaman _Mocha_, he\r\nled a mutiny, and with his own hands murdered the commander, Captain\r\nEdgecomb, in his sleep. He came back to America with Captain Kidd, and was\r\nhiding, under the name of Kelly, when caught in 1699 at Charleston,\r\nopposite Boston, by the Governor of Massachusetts, who described him as\r\n\"the most impudent, hardened villain I ever saw.\" It was said that Gillam\r\nhad entered the service of the Mogul, turned Mohammedan, and been\r\ncircumcised. To settle this last point, the prisoner was examined by a\r\nsurgeon and a Jew, who both declared, on oath, that it was so.\r\n\r\n\r\nGILLS, JOHN.\r\n\r\nOne of Captain Teach's crew. Hanged in Virginia in 1718.\r\n\r\n\r\nGLASBY, HARRY.\r\n\r\nSailed as mate in the _Samuel_, of London (Captain Cary), which was taken\r\nin 1720 by Roberts, who made Glasby master on board the _Royal Fortune_.\r\n\r\nTried for piracy on the Guinea Coast in April and acquitted. Evidence was\r\nbrought at his trial to show that Glasby was forced to serve with the\r\npirates, for, being a \"sea-artist\" or sail-master, he was most useful to\r\nthem. Twice he tried to escape in the West Indies, on one occasion being\r\ntried with two others by a drunken jury of pirates. The other deserters\r\nwere shot, but Glasby was saved by one of his judges threatening to shoot\r\nanyone who made any attempt on him. Glasby befriended other prisoners and\r\ngave away his share of the plunder to them. When the _Royal Fortune_ was\r\ntaken by the _Swallow_, several of the most desperate pirates,\r\nparticularly one James Philips, took lighted matches with which to ignite\r\nthe powder magazine and blow up the ship. Glasby prevented this by placing\r\ntrusted sentinels below.\r\n\r\n\r\nGODEKINS, MASTER.\r\n\r\nThis notorious Hanseatic pirate, with another called Stertebeker, did\r\nfearful damage to English and other merchant shipping in the North Sea in\r\nthe latter part of the fourteenth century.\r\n\r\nOn June 1st, 1395, he seized an English ship laden with salt fish off the\r\ncoast of Denmark, her value being reckoned at £170. The master and crew of\r\ntwenty-five men they slew, the only mariner saved being a boy, whom the\r\npirates took with them to Wismar.\r\n\r\nThese same men took another English ship, the _Dogger_ (Captain Gervase\r\nCat). The _Dogger_ was at anchor, and the crew fishing, when the pirates\r\nattacked them. The captain and crew were wounded, and damage was done to\r\nthe tune of 200 nobles.\r\n\r\nAnother vessel taken was a Yarmouth barque, _Michael_ (master, Robert\r\nRigweys), while off Plymouth, the owner, Hugh ap Fen, losing 800 nobles.\r\nIn 1394 these Hanseatic pirates, with a large fleet, attacked the town of\r\nNorbern in Norway, plundering the town and taking away all they could\r\ncarry, as well as the merchants, who they held for ransom. The houses they\r\nburnt.\r\n\r\n\r\nGOFFE, CHRISTOPHER.\r\n\r\nOriginally one of Captain Woollery's crew of Rhode Island pirates. In\r\nNovember, 1687, he surrendered himself at Boston, and was pardoned. In\r\nAugust, 1691, was commissioned by the Governor to cruise with his ship,\r\nthe _Swan_, between Cape Cod and Cape Ann, to protect the coast from\r\npirates.\r\n\r\n\r\nGOLDSMITH, CAPTAIN THOMAS.\r\n\r\nOf Dartmouth in Devon.\r\n\r\nDuring the reign of Queen Anne, Goldsmith commanded a privateer vessel,\r\nthe _Snap Dragon_, of Dartmouth. He turned pirate and amassed great\r\nriches.\r\n\r\nThis pirate would have been forgotten by now were it not that he died in\r\nhis bed at Dartmouth, and was buried in the churchyard there. The lines\r\nengraved on his tombstone have been quoted in the Preface, but may be\r\nrepeated here:\r\n\r\n    Men that are virtuous serve the Lord;\r\n    And the Devil's by his friends ador'd;\r\n    And as they merit get a place\r\n    Amidst the bless'd or hellish race;\r\n    Pray then, ye learned clergy show\r\n    Where can this brute, Tom Goldsmith, go?\r\n    Whose life was one continual evil,\r\n    Striving to cheat God, Man, and Devil.\r\n\r\n\r\nGOMEZ, JOHN, _alias_ PANTHER KEY JOHN.\r\n\r\nBrother-in-law of the famous pirate Gasparilla.\r\n\r\nDied, credited with the great age of 120 years, at Panther Key in Florida\r\nin 1900.\r\n\r\n\r\nGOODALE, JOHN.\r\n\r\nA Devonshire man.\r\n\r\nGoodale, who was a renegade and had turned Mohammedan, held a position of\r\nimportance and wealth amongst the Moors of Algiers. In the year 1621 he\r\nbought from the Moors a British prize called the _Exchange_, and also, for\r\nthe sum of £7 10s., an English slave, lately captain of an English\r\nmerchant ship, whom he got cheap owing to his having a deformed hand.\r\n\r\n\r\nGOODLY, CAPTAIN.\r\n\r\nAn English buccaneer of Jamaica, who in the year 1663 was in command of a\r\n\"junk\" armed with six guns and carrying a crew of sixty men.\r\n\r\n\r\nGORDON, CAPTAIN NATHANIEL.\r\n\r\nOf Portland, Maine.\r\n\r\nCommanded and owned the _Evie_, a small, full-rigged ship, which was\r\nfitted up as a \"slaver.\" Made four voyages to West Africa for slaves. On\r\nhis last voyage he was captured by the United States sloop _Mohican_, with\r\n967 negroes on board. Tried in New York for piracy and found guilty and\r\ncondemned to death. Great pressure was brought on President Lincoln to\r\nreprieve him, but without success, and Gordon was hanged at New York on\r\nFebruary 22nd, 1862.\r\n\r\n\r\nGOSS, CUTHBERT.\r\n\r\nBorn at Topsham in Devon.\r\n\r\nThe compiler of these biographies regrets to have to record that this\r\npirate was hanged, at the comparatively tender age of 21, outside the\r\ngates of Cape Coast Castle, within the flood-marks, in 1722. He was one of\r\nCaptain Roberts's crew, having been taken prisoner by Roberts at Calabar\r\nin a prize called the _Mercy_ galley, of Bristol, in 1721.\r\n\r\n\r\nGOW, CAPTAIN JOHN, _alias_ SMITH, _alias_ GOFFE. A Scotch pirate, born at\r\nThurso.\r\n\r\nAlthough the short career of this pirate made a great noise at the time,\r\nhe did little to merit the fame which he achieved. He had the honour of\r\nhaving an account of his piratical activities written by Defoe, and ninety\r\nyears later was made the hero in a novel by Walter Scott, as Captain\r\nCleveland.\r\n\r\nGow sailed from Amsterdam as a foremast hand in the _George_ galley,\r\ncommanded by Captain Ferneau, a Guernsey man. Being a brisk and\r\nintelligent man, he was soon promoted to be second mate. They called at\r\nSanta Cruz in Barbary to take in a cargo of beeswax to deliver at Genoa.\r\nSailing from Santa Cruz on November 3rd, 1724, Gow and a few others\r\nconspired to mutiny and then to go \"upon the account.\" The captain, as was\r\nhis custom, had all hands, except the helmsman, into his cabin at eight\r\no'clock each night for prayers. This particular night, after it was dark,\r\nthe conspirators went below to the hammocks of the chief mate, the\r\nsupercargo, and the surgeon and cut all their throats. They did the same\r\nto the captain, who was then thrown overboard though still alive.\r\n\r\nGow being now elected captain and one Williams, a thorough rogue, mate,\r\nthey renamed the vessel the _Revenge_, armed her with eighteen guns, and\r\ncruised off the coast of Spain, taking an English sloop with a cargo of\r\nfish from Newfoundland, commanded by Captain Thomas Wise of Poole. Their\r\nsecond prize was a Glasgow ship loaded with herrings and salmon.\r\n\r\nThey next sailed to Madeira, where Gow presented the Governor with a box\r\nof Scotch herrings. About this time Williams, the first mate, insulted Gow\r\nby accusing him of cowardice because he had refused to attack a big French\r\nship, and snapped his pistol at him. Two seamen standing near shot\r\nWilliams, wounding him severely, and to get rid of him they put him aboard\r\none of their prizes. Discussions now took place as to where to sail, and\r\nGow, who was in love with a lass in the Orkney Islands, suggested sailing\r\nthither, as being a good place to traffic their stolen goods.\r\n\r\nOn arriving at Carristown they sold most of their cargo, and one of the\r\ncrew, going on shore, bought a horse for three pieces of eight and rode\r\nto Kirkwall and surrendered himself. Next day ten more men deserted,\r\nsetting out in the long-boat for the mainland of Scotland, but were taken\r\nprisoners in the _Forth_, of Edinburgh. By now the whole countryside was\r\nalarmed. Gow's next move was to land his men and plunder the houses of the\r\ngentry. They visited a Mrs. Honnyman and her daughter, but these ladies\r\nmanaged to get their money and jewellery away in safety. Gow's crew\r\nmarched back to their ship with a bagpiper playing at their head.\r\n\r\nThey now sailed to Calfsound, seized three girls and took them aboard.\r\nThen to the Island of Eda to plunder the house of Mr. Fea, an old\r\nschoolmate of Gow's. Arriving there on February 13th, by bad management\r\nthey ran their vessel on the rocks. The bo'son and five men went ashore\r\nand met Mr. Fea, who entertained them at the local public-house. By a\r\nsimple stratagem, Mr. Fea seized first the bo'son and afterwards the five\r\nmen. Soon after this, Fea trapped Gow and all the rest of his crew of\r\ntwenty-eight men. Help was sent for, and eventually the _Greyhound_\r\nfrigate arrived and took Gow and his crew to London, arriving off Woolwich\r\non March 26th, 1725. The prisoners were taken to the Marshalsea Prison in\r\nSouthwark, and there found their old companion, Lieutenant Williams. Four\r\nmen turned King's evidence--viz., George Dobson, Job Phinnies, Tim Murphy,\r\nand William Booth.\r\n\r\nThe trial at Newgate began on May 8th, when Gow was sullen and reserved\r\nand refused to plead. He was ordered to be pressed to death, which was the\r\nonly form of torture still allowed by the law. At the last moment Gow\r\nyielded, and pleaded \"not guilty.\" Gow was found guilty, and hanged on\r\nJune 11th, 1725, but \"as he was turned off, he fell down from the Gibbit,\r\nthe rope breaking by the weight of some that pulled his leg. Although\r\nhe had been hanging for four minutes, he was able to climb up the ladder a\r\nsecond time, which seemed to concern him very little, and he was hanged\r\nagain.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PRESSING A PIRATE TO PLEAD.\r\n\r\nTo face p. 140.]\r\n\r\nHis body was then taken to Greenwich and there hanged in chains, to be a\r\nwarning to others.\r\n\r\n\r\nGRAFF, LE CAPITAINE LAURENS DE. Filibuster.\r\n\r\nCommanded _Le Neptune_, a ship armed with fifty-four guns and a crew of\r\n210 men, in the West Indies in the seventeenth century.\r\n\r\n\r\nGRAHAM, CAPTAIN.\r\n\r\nCommanded a shallop, with a crew of fourteen men, in 1685. Sailed in\r\ncompany with Captain Veale up and down the coast of Virginia and New\r\nEngland.\r\n\r\n\r\nGRAMBO.\r\n\r\nWas \"boss\" of Barataria, the smugglers' stronghold off the Island of\r\nGrande Terre, near Louisiana, until shot by Jean Lafitte in 1811.\r\n\r\n\r\nGRAMMONT, SIEUR DE. French filibuster.\r\n\r\nOne of the great buccaneers. Born in Paris, he entered the Royal Marines,\r\nin which he distinguished himself in several naval engagements.\r\n\r\nHe commanded a frigate in the West Indies, and captured near Martinique a\r\nDutch ship with a cargo worth £400,000, which he carried to Hispaniola,\r\nbut there lost all of it through gambling, and, not daring to return to\r\nFrance, he joined the buccaneers.\r\n\r\nHe sailed to Curaçoa in 1678 with the Count d'Estrees' fleet, which was\r\nwrecked on a coral reef off the Isle d'Aves. De Grammont was left behind\r\nto salve what he could from the wreck. After this, with 700 men he sailed\r\nto Maracaibo, spending six months on the lake, seizing the shipping and\r\nplundering all the settlements in the neighbourhood.\r\n\r\nIn June, 1680, de Grammont, with an obsolete commission and a small party\r\nof men, made a brilliant night assault on La Guayra, the seaport of\r\nCaracas. Only forty-seven men took part in the actual attack on the town,\r\nwhich was guarded by two forts and by cannon upon the walls. The pirates\r\nwere attacked next day by 2,000 Spaniards from Caracas, but with the\r\ngreatest skill and bravery de Grammont got almost all his party away,\r\nthough wounded himself in the throat. He carried away with him amongst his\r\nprisoners the Governor of the town.\r\n\r\nHe retired to the Isle d'Aves to nurse his wound, and later went to Petit\r\nGoave.\r\n\r\nIn 1683 took part in the successful English and French attack on Vera\r\nCruz, and afterwards, when Vanhorn died of gangrene, de Grammont, his\r\nlieutenant, carried his ship back to Petit Goave. In 1685 he received a\r\nfresh commission from de Cossey, the Governor of Dominica, and joined\r\nforces with the famous buccaneer Laurens de Graff at the Isle of Vache,\r\nand sailed with 11,000 men for Campeachy. Taking the town, he reduced it\r\nto ashes and blew up the fortress, returning with the plunder to\r\nHispaniola. Before leaving, however, to celebrate the Festival of St.\r\nLouis, they burnt a huge bonfire, using 200,000 crowns worth of logwood.\r\n\r\nGrammont at this time commanded a fine ship, _Le Hardy_ (fifty guns and a\r\ncrew of 300 men).\r\n\r\nIn 1686 de Grammont was granted a commission of \"Lieutenant du Roi,\" in\r\norder to keep him from harassing the Spaniards, and yet not to lose his\r\nvaluable services to his country.\r\n\r\nIn order to have one last fling at the old free buccaneering life before\r\nsettling down to the more sedate and respectable calling of an officer in\r\nthe French King's navy, de Grammont sailed off with a party of 180\r\ndesperadoes, but was never heard of again.\r\n\r\n\r\nGRAND, PIERRE LE.\r\n\r\nA native of Dieppe in Normandy.\r\n\r\nLe Grand was the man who, having made one great and successful exploit,\r\nhad the good sense to retire. He was the first pirate to take up his\r\nquarters at Tortuga Island, and was known amongst the English as \"Peter\r\nthe Great.\" His name will go down to posterity for his \"bold and insolent\"\r\naction when in a small open boat with a handful of men he seized a great\r\nSpanish galleon.\r\n\r\nPierre had been out on the \"grand account\" for a long while, meeting with\r\nno success. When almost starving and in despair, a great Spanish fleet\r\nhove in sight, and one ship, bigger than the rest, was observed sailing at\r\nsome little distance behind the other vessels. The mad idea entered the\r\nhead of the now desperate pirate to take this ship. The pirates all took\r\nan oath to their captain to fight without fear and never to surrender. It\r\nwas dusk, and in these tropical latitudes night follows day very quickly.\r\nBefore the attack, orders were given to the surgeon to bore a hole in the\r\nbottom of the boat so that it would quickly sink, thus taking away any\r\nhope of escape should the enterprise fail. This was done, and the boat was\r\npaddled quietly alongside the great warship, when the crew, armed only\r\nwith a pistol and a sword a-piece, clambered up the sides and jumped\r\naboard. Quickly and silently the sleeping helmsman was killed, while\r\nPierre and a party of his men ran down into the great cabin, where they\r\nsurprised the Spanish admiral playing cards with his officers. The\r\nadmiral, suddenly confronted by a band of bearded desperadoes in his cabin\r\nwith a pistol aimed at his head, ejaculated \"Jesus bless us! are these\r\ndevils or what are they?\" While this was going on others of the pirates\r\nhad hurried to the gun-room, seized the arms, killing every Spaniard who\r\nwithstood them. Pierre knew, as scarcely any other successful pirate or\r\ngambler ever did, the right moment to stop. He at once put ashore all the\r\nprisoners he did not want for working the ship, and sailed straight back\r\nto France; where he lived the rest of his life in comfortable obscurity,\r\nand never again returned to piracy.\r\n\r\nThe news of this exploit spread rapidly over the West Indies, and caused\r\nthe greatest excitement amongst the pirate fraternity of Tortuga and\r\nHispaniola.\r\n\r\nMen left their work of killing and drying beef, while others deserted\r\ntheir plantations to go a-pirating on the Spaniards, in much the same way\r\nas men went to a gold rush years after. Those who had no boat would\r\nventure forth in canoes looking for rich Spanish treasure ships.\r\n\r\nIt was this wild deed of Pierre le Grand that was the beginning of piracy\r\nin the West Indies, towards the latter half of the seventeenth century.\r\n\r\n\r\nGRANGE, ROGER.\r\n\r\nOne of Captain Lowther's crew of the _Happy Delivery_. Tried for piracy at\r\nSt. Kitts in 1722, but acquitted.\r\n\r\n\r\nDE GRAVES, CAPTAIN HERBERT.\r\n\r\nThis Dutch pirate sailed as captain of his own merchant vessel during the\r\nreign of King Charles II. He took to landing his crew on the south coast\r\nof England and raiding gentlemen's houses. The first he ever pillaged was\r\nthat of a Mr. Sturt, in Sussex. In those days, when banks were almost\r\nunknown, the houses of the rich often contained great sums of money. De\r\nGraves was wont to sail along the Devonshire coast, sometimes landing and\r\nrobbing a house, sometimes taking a ship, which he would carry to\r\nRotterdam and sell. He made several daring raids into Cowes and Lowestoft,\r\ngetting off with valuable plunder.\r\n\r\nIn the war between England and the Dutch, Graves was given command of a\r\nfire-ship. This vessel he handled very capably, and in the action off the\r\nDowns he ran her on board the _Sandwich_, setting her on fire. James, Duke\r\nof York, escaped from the _Sandwich_ with great difficulty, while the Earl\r\nof Albemarle and most of the crew perished. At the conclusion of the war,\r\nDe Graves returned to piracy, but his ship was wrecked in a storm close to\r\nWalmer Castle. The captain and a few of his crew were saved, and, being\r\nmade prisoners, were hanged on a tree.\r\n\r\n\r\nGREAVES, CAPTAIN, _alias_ \"RED LEGS.\" West Indian pirate.\r\n\r\nBorn in Barbadoes of prisoners who had been sent there as slaves by\r\nCromwell. Most of these slaves were natives of Scotland and Ireland, and,\r\nowing to their bare knees, generally went by the name of Red Legs. Young\r\nGreaves was left an orphan, but had a kind master and a good education.\r\nHis master dying, the lad was sold to another and a cruel one. The boy ran\r\naway, swam across Carlisle Bay, but by mistake clambered on to the wrong\r\nship, a pirate vessel, commanded by a notoriously cruel pirate called\r\nCaptain Hawkins. Finding himself driven to the calling of piracy, Greaves\r\nbecame very efficient, and quickly rose to eminence. He was remarkable for\r\nhis dislike of unnecessary bloodshed, torture of prisoners, and killing of\r\nnon-combatants. These extraordinary views brought about a duel between\r\nhimself and his captain, in which the former was victorious, and he was at\r\nonce elected commander.\r\n\r\nGreaves now entered a period of the highest piratical success, but always\r\npreserved very strictly his reputation for humanity and morality. He never\r\ntortured his prisoners, nor ever robbed the poor, nor maltreated women.\r\n\r\nHis greatest success of all was his capture of the Island of Margarita,\r\noff the coast of Venezuela.\r\n\r\nOn this occasion, after capturing the Spanish Fleet, he turned the guns of\r\ntheir warships against the forts, which he then stormed, and was rewarded\r\nby a huge booty of pearls and gold.\r\n\r\nRed Legs then retired to the respectable life of a planter in the Island\r\nof Nevis, but was one day denounced as a pirate by an old seaman. He was\r\ncast into a dungeon to await execution, when the great earthquake came\r\nwhich destroyed and submerged the town in 1680, and one of the few\r\nsurvivors was Greaves. He was picked up by a whaler, on board of which he\r\nserved with success, and later on, for his assistance in capturing a gang\r\nof pirates, he received pardon for his earlier crimes.\r\n\r\nHe again retired to a plantation, and was noted for his many acts of piety\r\nand for his generous gifts to charities and public institutions,\r\neventually dying universally respected and sorrowed.\r\n\r\n\r\nGREENSAIL, RICHARD.\r\n\r\nOne of Blackbeard's crew in the _Queen Ann's Revenge_. Hanged in Virginia\r\nin 1718.\r\n\r\n\r\nGREENVILLE, HENRY.\r\n\r\nHanged at Boston in 1726 with Captain Fly and Samuel Cole.\r\n\r\n\r\nGRIFFIN, JACK.\r\n\r\nChief mate of a Bristol vessel. One of the chief mutineers on board the\r\n_Bird_ galley in 1718, off Sierra Leone, when he befriended the captain of\r\nthe _Bird_, with whom he had been at school. Took part in a feast to\r\ncelebrate the success of the mutiny, the meal being cooked in a huge\r\ncaldron in which the slaves' food was prepared. In this caldron were\r\nboiled, on this occasion, fowls, ducks, geese, and turkeys, which were\r\nunplucked; several Westphalian hams were added, and a \"large sow with\r\nyoung embowled.\" The health of King James III., the Pretender, was drunk\r\nwith full honours.\r\n\r\n\r\nGRIFFIN, JOHN.\r\n\r\nOf Blackwall, Middlesex.\r\n\r\nTaken out of the _Mercy_ galley and appointed carpenter on board the\r\n_Royal Fortune_ by Captain Roberts. Condemned to be hanged at Cape Coast\r\nCastle, but pardoned and sold to the Royal African Company as a slave for\r\nseven years.\r\n\r\n\r\nGRIFFIN, RICHARD.\r\n\r\nA gunsmith of Boston.\r\n\r\nSailed with Captain Pound. Wounded in a fight at Tarpaulin Cove, a bullet\r\nentering his ear and coming out through his eye.\r\n\r\n\r\nGROGNIET, CAPTAIN.\r\n\r\nA French buccaneer who in 1683 was in company with Captain L'Escayer, with\r\na crew of some 200 French and 80 English freebooters. He joined Davis and\r\nSwan during the blockade of Panama in 1685, and was in the unsuccessful\r\nattempt in May, 1685, on the Spanish treasure fleet from Lima. In July of\r\nthe same year Grogniet, with 340 French buccaneers, parted company from\r\nDavis at Quibo, plundered several towns, and then, foolishly, revisited\r\nQuibo, where they were discovered by a Spanish squadron in January, 1686,\r\nand their ship was burnt while the crew was on shore. They were rescued\r\nby Townley, with whom they went north to Nicaragua, and sacked Granada. In\r\nMay, 1686, Grogniet and half the Frenchmen crossed the isthmus. In the\r\nJanuary following, Grogniet reappeared, and, joining with the English,\r\nagain plundered Guayaquil, where he was severely wounded, and died soon\r\nafterwards.\r\n\r\n\r\nGULLIMILLIT, BRETI.\r\n\r\nTaken with other South American pirates by H.M. sloop _Tyne_, and hanged\r\nat Kingston, Jamaica, in 1823.\r\n\r\n\r\nGUTTEREZ, JUAN.\r\n\r\nHanged at Kingston, Jamaica, on February 7th, 1823.\r\n\r\n\r\nGUY, CAPTAIN.\r\n\r\nCommanded the frigate _James_ (fourteen guns, ninety men). Belonged to\r\nTortuga Island and Jamaica in 1663.\r\n\r\n\r\nHAINS, RICHARD.\r\n\r\nOne of Captain Low's crew. When Low took a Portuguese ship at St.\r\nMichael's in the Azores in 1723, he, with unusual kindness, simply burnt\r\nthe ship and let the crew go to shore in a boat. While the prisoners were\r\ngetting out the boat, Richard Hains happened to be drinking punch out of a\r\nsilver tankard at one of the open ports, and took the opportunity to drop\r\ninto the boat among the Portuguese and lie down in the bottom, so as to\r\nescape with them. Suddenly remembering his silver tankard, he climbed\r\nback, seized the tankard, and hid again in the boat, somehow, by great\r\ngood fortune, being unobserved by those on the ship, and so escaped almost\r\ncertain death both for himself and the Portuguese sailors.\r\n\r\n\r\nHALSEY, CAPTAIN JOHN.\r\n\r\nThis famous South Sea pirate was born on March 1st, 1670, at Boston, and\r\nreceived a commission from the Governor of Massachusetts to cruise as a\r\nprivateer on the Banks. No sooner was he out of sight of land than Halsey\r\nturned pirate. Taking a ship or two, he sailed to the Canary Islands,\r\npicking up a rich Spanish ship there. He next doubled the Cape of Good\r\nHope, and paid a call on the \"brethren\" at Madagascar. He then sailed to\r\nthe Red Sea, another happy hunting ground of the pirates, and met a big\r\nDutch ship armed with sixty guns. Halsey astounded his men by announcing\r\nhis sudden determination to attack only Moorish ships in the future. The\r\nindignant crew mutinied, threw Captain Halsey and his chief gunner in\r\nirons, and proceeded to attack the Dutchman. The mutinous pirates got the\r\nworst of the encounter, and released Halsey, who only just managed to get\r\nhis ship away. Luck seems to have deserted Halsey for a while, for not a\r\nMoorish ship could he meet with, so much so that his scruples against\r\ntaking Christian ships eased enough to permit him to bag a brace of\r\nEnglish ships, the _Essex_ and the _Rising Eagle_.\r\n\r\nThe captain of the former proved to be a very old and dear friend of\r\nHalsey's quartermaster, and to show a friendly feeling, Halsey allowed the\r\ncaptain to keep all his personal belongings. Nevertheless, they took a\r\ncomfortable booty, comprising some fifty thousand pounds in English gold,\r\nout of the _Essex_, and another ten thousand out of the _Rising Eagle_.\r\n\r\nThe pirates, being strict business men, produced invoices and sold the two\r\nships back to their legal owners for cash, and having settled this affair\r\nto everybody's satisfaction, Halsey and his consort returned to\r\nMadagascar. Here they were visited by the captain of a Scotch ship, the\r\n_Neptune_, which had come to trade liquor, probably rum, but possibly\r\nwhisky, with the pirates. A sudden hurricane arose, destroying both the\r\npirate ships and damaging the _Neptune_. Halsey, ever a man of resource,\r\nthereupon seized the Scotch ship, and, with even greater enterprise, at\r\nonce attacked a ship, the _Greyhound_, which lay at anchor, which was\r\nloaded with stolen merchandise which the pirates had only just sold to the\r\ncaptain of the _Greyhound_, and for which they had been paid.\r\n\r\nThe end was now drawing near, for in 1716 Captain Halsey was taken ill of\r\nsome tropical fever and died. He was a popular commander, respected, ever\r\nloved by his men, for he was a humane man, never killing his prisoners\r\nunless necessity compelled. A contemporary eyewitness of his funeral rites\r\nleaves the following account of his burial:\r\n\r\n\"With great solemnity, the prayers of the Church of England being read\r\nover him and his sword and pistols laid on his coffin, which was covered\r\nwith a ship's Jack. As many minute guns were fired as he was old--viz.,\r\n46--and three English vollies and one French volley of small arms.\" The\r\nchronicler continues: \"His grave was made in a garden of watermelons and\r\nfenced in to prevent his being rooted up by wild pigs.\"\r\n\r\nThis last a truly touching thought on the part of the bereaved.\r\n\r\n\r\nHAMAN, CAPTAIN JOHN.\r\n\r\nHe lived all alone with his wife and family on a small and otherwise\r\nuninhabited island in the Bahamas.\r\n\r\nAbout the year 1720, he sailed into New Providence Harbour in his 40-ton\r\nsloop, intending to settle there. Captain Rackam and Anne Bonny stole this\r\nvessel and eloped in her.\r\n\r\nWriting of Captain Haman, Johnson tells us \"his Livelihood and constant\r\nEmployment was to plunder and pillage the Spaniards, whose Sloops and\r\nLaunces he had often surprised about Cuba and Hispaniola, and sometimes\r\nbrought off a considerable Booty, always escaping by a good Pair of Heels,\r\ninsomuch that it became a Bye-Word to say, 'There goes John Haman, catch\r\nhim if you can.' His Business to Providence now was to bring his Family\r\nthere, in order to live and settle, being weary, perhaps, of living in\r\nthat Solitude, or else apprehensive if any of the Spaniards should\r\ndiscover his Habitation, they might land, and be revenged of him for all\r\nhis Pranks.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nHAMLIN, CAPTAIN JEAN.\r\n\r\nA famous French filibuster who turned pirate.\r\n\r\nSet out in 1682 from Jamaica in a sloop with 120 other desperadoes in\r\npursuit of a French ship that was \"wanted\" by the Jamaican Governor.\r\nHaving overtaken the ship, _La Trompeuse_, he seized her, fitted her up as\r\na man-of-war, and then started out on a wild piratical cruise, taking\r\neighteen Jamaican vessels, barbarously ill-treating the crews, and\r\ncompletely demoralizing the trade of the island. Two other ships were now\r\nsent to find and destroy the new _La Trompeuse_, but Hamlin escaped and\r\nsailed to the Virgin Islands, and was most hospitably received by the\r\nGovernor of the Danish Island of St. Thomas, one Adolf Esmit, who was\r\nhimself a retired pirate. Using this island as his headquarters Hamlin\r\ncruised about and took several English ships.\r\n\r\nIn May, 1683, he appeared on the West Coast of Africa disguised as an\r\nEnglish man-of-war. Off the coast of Sierra Leone, he took seventeen Dutch\r\nand English ships, returning to Dominica in July, 1683, finally reaching\r\nthe friendly St. Thomas Island, being warmly welcomed back by the pirate\r\nGovernor. Three days afterwards, H.M.S. _Francis_ arrived on the lookout\r\nfor pirates, and attacked and burnt Hamlin's ship. Hamlin, with the help\r\nof the Governor, managed to escape with his life.\r\n\r\n\r\nHANDS, ISRAEL, also known as BASILICA HANDS.\r\n\r\nSailing-master with the famous Teach or Blackbeard. One day when Teach was\r\nentertaining a pilot and Hands in his cabin, after they had been drinking\r\nand chatting awhile seated round the cabin table, on which stood a lighted\r\ncandle, Blackbeard suddenly drew his pistols, blew out the candle, and\r\ncrossing his arms, fired both his pistols under the table. Hands was shot\r\nin the knee, and crippled for life. Teach's explanation to the angry\r\ndemands of his guests as to the reason for this extraordinary conduct\r\nproduced the reply that \"if he did not shoot one or two of them now and\r\nthen, they'd forget who he was.\" Hands after this deserted, but was\r\ncaptured at Bath in Carolina by Brand. Hands, probably in revenge for\r\nbeing wantonly shot by Teach, turned King's evidence at the inquiry held\r\nat Charleston, and brought very serious accusations against one of the\r\nmost prominent men in the colony, Knight, who was secretary to the Chief\r\nJustice, and a deputy collector of Customs.\r\n\r\nHands was tried for piracy in Virginia in December, 1718, but pardoned.\r\nWhen last heard of was seen begging his bread in London.\r\n\r\n\r\nHANSEL, CAPTAIN.\r\n\r\nHe behaved himself so courageously at the taking of Porto Bello in 1669,\r\nthat a party of some 400 men, in four ships, chose Hansel to be their\r\nadmiral in an attempt on the town of Comana, near Caracas. This attack was\r\na most complete failure, the pirates being driven off \"with great loss\r\nand in great confusion.\" When Hansel's party arrived back at Jamaica, they\r\nfound the rest of Morgan's men had returned before them, who \"ceased not\r\nto mock and jeer at them for their ill success at Comana, after telling\r\nthem, 'Let us see what money you brought from Comana, and if it be as good\r\nsilver as that which we bring from Maracaibo.'\"\r\n\r\n\r\nHARDING, CAPTAIN THOMAS.\r\n\r\nIn 1653 he captured a rich prize, a Barbadoes vessel. For this he was\r\ntried for piracy at Boston.\r\n\r\n\r\nHARDY, RICHARD.\r\n\r\nOne of Captain Bartholomew Roberts's crew. Hanged at Cape Coast Castle,\r\nWest Coast of Africa, on April 6th, 1722, at the age of 25 years.\r\n\r\nIt is recorded that, owing to the lack of expert knowledge in the niceties\r\nof carrying out executions, Hardy was led to the scaffold with his hands\r\ntied behind him. This annoyed Hardy very much, and it is mentioned in the\r\nofficial account of his execution that the prisoner indignantly declared\r\n\"that he had seen many a Man hang'd, but this Way of the Hands being ty'd\r\nbehind them, he was a Stranger to, and never saw before in his Life.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nHARPER, ABRAHAM.\r\n\r\nBorn at Bristol.\r\n\r\nHe was cooper on board Captain Roberts's _Royal Fortune_. When the pirates\r\ntook a prize, it was Harper's duty to see that all the casks and coopers'\r\ntools were removed from the prize to the pirate craft.\r\n\r\nHanged at the age of 23, with the rest of the crew, in 1722.\r\n\r\n\r\nHARRIS, CAPTAIN.\r\n\r\nJoined the Barbary corsairs during the reign of Queen Elizabeth, turned\r\nMohammedan, and rose to command a Moorish pirate vessel. Cruised off the\r\ncoast of Ireland, was taken prisoner by an English ship, and hanged at\r\nWapping.\r\n\r\n\r\nHARRIS, HUGH.\r\n\r\nOf Corfe Castle, Dorsetshire.\r\n\r\nOne of Roberts's crew; tried and condemned to be hanged in 1722, but\r\nreprieved and sold to the Royal African Company to serve for seven years\r\nin their plantations.\r\n\r\n\r\nHARRIS, JAMES.\r\n\r\nOne of Roberts's crew.\r\n\r\n\r\nHARRIS, PETER.\r\n\r\nBorn in Kent.\r\n\r\nThis buccaneer was known amongst the brethren of the coast as \"a brave and\r\nStout Soldier.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1680 he took a leading part in the march of the buccaneers across the\r\nIsthmus of Darien, but during the attack on the Spanish Fleet off Panama\r\nhe was shot in both legs, and died of his wounds.\r\n\r\n\r\nHARRIS, RICHARD.\r\n\r\nA Cornishman.\r\n\r\nOne of Captain Roberts's crew and the oldest, being 45 years of age when\r\nhe was hanged, an unusually advanced age to reach in this most \"unhealthy\"\r\nprofession.\r\n\r\n\r\nHARRISON, CAPTAIN.\r\n\r\nSailed in October, 1670, in company with Captains Prince and Ludbury, into\r\nPort Royal, after a successful expedition with 170 men up the San Juan\r\nRiver in Nicaragua, when they plundered the unfortunate city of Granada.\r\nThis city had suffered so much from previous attacks from the buccaneers\r\nthat the plunder came to only some £20 per man on this occasion.\r\n\r\nModyford, the Governor of Jamaica, \"reproved the captains for acting\r\nwithout commissions, but did not deem it prudent to press the matter too\r\nfar\"; in fact, instead of arresting Harrison and his crew, he sent them to\r\njoin Morgan the Buccaneer, who was then gathering together a great fleet\r\nof buccaneers at the Isle of Vache.\r\n\r\n\r\nHARVEY, CAPTAIN.\r\n\r\nArrived at New London in 1685 in company with another pirate, Captain\r\nVeale; posed as an honest merchant, but, being recognized, left in great\r\nhaste.\r\n\r\n\r\nHARVEY, WILLIAM.\r\n\r\nTried for piracy with the rest of Gow's crew at Newgate in 1725, and\r\nacquitted.\r\n\r\n\r\nHARWOOD, JOHN.\r\n\r\nTried for piracy at Boston in 1704. One of the crew of the brigantine\r\n_Charles_ (Captain John Quelch, Commander).\r\n\r\n\r\nHATTSELL, CAPTAIN.\r\n\r\nThis buccaneer served as an officer with Mansfield in his successful and\r\ndaring night attack on the Island of Providence, when, with only 200 men,\r\nthe fort was captured and the Spanish Governor taken prisoner. Captain\r\nHattsell was left behind with thirty-five men to hold the island, while\r\nMansfield sailed to the mainland with his prisoners, who had surrendered\r\non condition that they should be safely conducted there.\r\n\r\n\r\nHAWKINS, CAPTAIN.\r\n\r\nA seventeenth-century Barbadoes pirate. Notorious for his cruelty, which\r\nled to his fighting a duel with one of his crew, Greaves, _alias_ Red\r\nLegs, by whom he was defeated, his victor being elected captain in his\r\nplace.\r\n\r\n\r\nHAWKINS, SIR JOHN.\r\n\r\nBorn in 1532.\r\n\r\nThis famous Elizabethan seaman sailed in 1561 to the Canary Islands, and\r\ntraded in negro slaves between Africa and Hispaniola. Afterwards became an\r\nofficer in the Royal Navy. Died at sea off Porto Bello, in 1595, when\r\nserving with Drake in the West Indies.\r\n\r\n\r\nHAWKINS, CAPTAIN THOMAS.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1689 cruised off the coast of New England, burning and\r\nplundering the shipping. The Bay colony sent out an armed sloop, the\r\n_Mary_ (Samuel Pease, commander), in October of that year, to attempt to\r\ncapture Hawkins. Pease found the pirate in Buzzard's Bay. Hawkins ran up a\r\nred flag and a furious engagement began. The crew of the _Mary_ at last\r\nboarded the pirates, and the captain, Pease, was so severely wounded that\r\nhe died.\r\n\r\n\r\nHAWKINS, THOMAS.\r\n\r\nBorn at Boston.\r\n\r\nTurned pirate and cruised with Captain Pound. Tried for piracy at Boston\r\nin 1690, but reprieved. Sent to England, but on the voyage was killed in a\r\nfight with a French privateer.\r\n\r\n\r\nHAYES, CAPTAIN, nicknamed \"Bully Hayes.\" A South Sea pirate.\r\n\r\nIn 1870 was arrested by the English Consul at Samoa for piracy. There\r\nbeing no prison in this delightful island, the Consul ran Hayes's ship on\r\nshore, and waited for a man-of-war to call and take his prisoner away.\r\nHayes spent his time, while under open arrest, attending native picnic\r\nparties, at which he was the life and soul, being, when off duty, a man of\r\ngreat charm of manner and a favourite with the ladies. Presently another\r\npirate arrived, one Captain Pease, in an armed ship with a Malay crew.\r\nHayes and Pease quarrelled violently, and the Consul had great trouble to\r\nkeep the two pirates from coming to blows. This animosity was all a sham\r\nto throw dust in the Consul's eyes, for one night Pease sailed away with\r\nHayes, whom he had smuggled on board his ship.\r\n\r\n\r\nHAZEL, THOMAS.\r\n\r\nOf Westminster.\r\n\r\nHanged in Rhode Island in 1723 at the advanced age, for a pirate, of 50.\r\nThis is one of the longest lived pirates we have been able to hear of.\r\n\r\n\r\nHEAMAN, PETER, _alias_ ROGERS.\r\n\r\nA French pirate, born in 1787.\r\n\r\nSailed from Gibraltar in May, 1821, as mate on board the schooner _Jane_\r\n(Captain Thomas Johnson), bound for Bahia, Brazil, with a very rich cargo\r\nof beeswax, silk, olives, and other goods, as well as eight barrels of\r\nSpanish dollars.\r\n\r\nWhen about seventeen days out, in the middle of the night, Heaman attacked\r\none of the crew, James Paterson, and beat him to death. On the captain\r\ncoming up on deck to find out what all the noise was about, Heaman beat\r\nhim to death with a musket, being assisted by the cook, Francis Gautier,\r\nalso a Frenchman. The two conspirators then proceeded to imprison the rest\r\nof the crew in the forecastle, and threw the dead bodies of the captain\r\nand the sailor overboard. For two days the murderers tried to suffocate\r\nthe crew by burning pitch and blowing the smoke into the forecastle.\r\nFailing to accomplish this they let the crew out after each had sworn on\r\nthe Bible not to inform on them. The course was now altered, and they\r\nsailed towards Scotland. The barrels of dollars were broken open and the\r\ncoins placed in bags. In June they reached the Island of Barra, where\r\nGautier went ashore, wearing the late captain's green coat, and bought a\r\nlarge boat. Next, they sailed to Stornoway, where they arrived in July,\r\nand here they sank their schooner. The crew rowed ashore in the long-boat,\r\nsharing out the dollars as they went, using an old tin as a measure, each\r\nman getting 6,300 dollars as his share. Their boat was smashed on the\r\nrocks when landing, but they got their plunder safely ashore and hid it\r\namongst the stones on the beach. Early next morning the mutineers were\r\nvisited by the Customs officer. After he had left, the cabin boy, a\r\nMaltese, ran after him and told him the true story of the murders and\r\nrobbery. A party of islanders was got together, the mutineers arrested and\r\ntaken to Edinburgh, where Heaman and Gautier were tried for piracy and\r\nmurder, and on November 27th found guilty and condemned to death. They\r\nwere both hanged on January 9th, 1822, on the sands of Leith, within the\r\nflood mark, and afterwards their bodies were delivered to Dr. Alexander\r\nMunro, Professor of Anatomy in the University of Edinburgh, to be publicly\r\ndissected by him.\r\n\r\n\r\nHEATH, PELEG.\r\n\r\nOne of William Coward's crew. Condemned to be hanged at Boston in 1690,\r\nbut afterwards reprieved.\r\n\r\n\r\nHEIDON, CAPTAIN.\r\n\r\nArrested for piracy in 1564 for having captured a Flemish ship. This\r\nvessel he manned with thirteen Scotchmen in addition to his own crew, and\r\nsailed off the coast of Spain. Here he took a prize containing a cargo of\r\nwine, which he carried to the Island of Bere in Bantry Bay. The wine was\r\nsold to Lord O'Sullivan. Heidon now fitted up another ship, the _John of\r\nSandwich_. Was wrecked in her on the Island of Alderney and Heidon was\r\narrested, but managed to escape in a small boat with some others of the\r\npirates.\r\n\r\n\r\nHENLEY, CAPTAIN.\r\n\r\nIn 1683 sailed from Boston \"bound for the Rack,\" afterwards going to the\r\nRed Sea, where he plundered Arab and Malabar ships.\r\n\r\n\r\nHERDUE, CAPTAIN. Buccaneer.\r\n\r\nCommanded a frigate of four guns, crew of forty men, at Tortuga Island, in\r\n1663.\r\n\r\n\r\nHERNANDEZ, AUGUSTUS.\r\n\r\nHanged at Kingston, Jamaica, in 1823.\r\n\r\n\r\nHERNANDEZ, JUAN.\r\n\r\nCaptured with nine other pirates by H.M. sloop-of-war _Tyne_ and taken to\r\nJamaica. Hanged on February 7th, 1823, at Kingston.\r\n\r\n\r\nHERRIOTT, DAVID.\r\n\r\nMaster of the _Adventure_, from Jamaica, taken by Teach in 1718. He joined\r\nthe pirates, and later, when Major Stede Bonnet separated from Teach, he\r\ntook Herriott to be his sailing-master. Taken prisoner with Bonnet and his\r\ncrew of the _Royal James_ by Colonel Rhet, at Cape Fear, North Carolina,\r\nSeptember 27th, 1718. Herriott and the boatswain, Ignatius Pell, turned\r\nKing's evidence at the trial of the pirates held at Charleston. On October\r\n25th, Bonnet and Herriott escaped from prison, in spite of the fact that\r\nthe latter had turned King's evidence. Herriott was shot on Sullivan\r\nIsland a few days later.\r\n\r\n\r\nHEWETT, WILLIAM, or HEWET, or HEWIT.\r\n\r\nOf Jamaica.\r\n\r\nOne of Major Stede Bonnet's crew. Tried for piracy at Charleston in 1718,\r\nand hanged at White Point on November 8th, and buried in the marsh below\r\nlow-water mark.\r\n\r\n\r\nHIDE, DANIEL.\r\n\r\nOf Virginia.\r\n\r\nOne of the crew of Captain Charles Harris, who, with Captain Low, played\r\nhavoc on the shipping off the American coast from New York to Charleston.\r\nHanged at Newport, Rhode Island, in July, 1723, at the age of 23.\r\n\r\n\r\nHILL, CORPORAL JOHN.\r\n\r\nIn charge of the guard at Fort Royal, Falmouth, Maine, which all deserted\r\none night, and went to sea with the pirate Captain Pound. Killed at\r\nTarpaulin Cove in 1689.\r\n\r\n\r\nHILLIARD, JOHN.\r\n\r\nWas \"chief man\" of the company of Captain Bartholomew Sharp on his\r\n\"dangerous voyage\" to the South Seas. Died on January 2nd, 1681, of\r\ndropsy; buried at sea with the usual buccaneers' honours.\r\n\r\n\r\nHINCHER, DR. JOHN.\r\n\r\nOf Edinburgh University.\r\n\r\nTried for piracy in July, 1723, at Newport, Rhode Island, but acquitted.\r\nThis young doctor, his age was only 22, was taken off a prize by Captain\r\nLow against his will, to act as ship's surgeon with the pirates.\r\n\r\n\r\nHIND, ISRAEL, or HYNDE.\r\n\r\nOf Bristol.\r\n\r\nOne of Captain Roberts's crew. Hanged at Cape Coast Castle in 1722, at the\r\nage of 30.\r\n\r\n\r\nHINGSON, JOHN.\r\n\r\nOne of Wafer's party left behind and lost in the forest when Dampier\r\ncrossed the Isthmus of Darien on foot in 1681.\r\n\r\n\r\nHITCHENS, ROBERT.\r\n\r\nA Devonshire man, born in the year 1515.\r\n\r\nTook to piracy early in life. Sailed with the pirate Captain Heidon, and\r\nwas wrecked on Alderney in the year 1564. Arrested and tried for piracy,\r\nand was hanged in chains at low-water mark at St. Martin's Point,\r\nGuernsey, in 1564, at the age of 50.\r\n\r\n\r\nHOLDING, ANTHONY.\r\n\r\nOne of John Quelch's crew of the brigantine _Charles_. Tried for piracy at\r\nBoston in 1704.\r\n\r\n\r\nHOLFORD, CAPTAIN. Buccaneer.\r\n\r\nOf Jamaica.\r\n\r\nAn old friend of the notorious pirate Vane. In 1718 he happened to arrive\r\nin his ship at a small uninhabited island in the Bay of Honduras to find\r\nVane on shore and destitute. Vane thought he would be saved by Holford,\r\nbut the latter was quite frank in refusing, saying: \"I shan't trust you\r\naboard my ship unless I carry you a prisoner, for I shall have you\r\ncaballing with my men, knock me on the head, and run away with my ship\r\na-pyrating.\" It was owing to Holford that Vane was eventually taken a\r\nprisoner to Jamaica and there hanged.\r\n\r\n\r\nHOLLAND, CAPTAIN RICHARD.\r\n\r\nAn Irishman.\r\n\r\nCommanded a Spanish pirate vessel in the West Indies in 1724. The crew\r\nconsisted of sixty Spaniards, eighteen French, and eighteen English\r\nsailors. Holland had originally belonged to the Royal Navy, but deserted\r\nfrom the _Suffolk_ at Naples, and took shelter in a convent in that city.\r\nIn August, 1724, Holland's ship took as prizes the _John and Mary_, the\r\n_Prudent Hannah of Boston_, and the _Dolphin_, of Topsham, all on their\r\nway to Virginia. From out of the _John and Mary_ he took thirty-six men\r\nslaves, some gold dust, the captain's clothes, four great guns and small\r\narms, and 400 gallons of rum.\r\n\r\n\r\nHOPKINS, MR. Buccaneer and apothecary.\r\n\r\nFirst lieutenant to Captain Dover (a doctor of physic) on board the\r\n_Duchess_ privateer, of Bristol. Mr. Hopkins was an apothecary by\r\nprofession, not a sailor, but being a kinsman to the captain, no doubt was\r\ngiven promotion. He sailed from Bristol on August 2nd, 1708.\r\n\r\n\r\nHORE, CAPTAIN.\r\n\r\nAbout 1650 Hore turned from a privateer into a pirate, and was very active\r\nand successful in taking prizes between New York and Newport, occasionally\r\nsailing to Madagascar to waylay ships of the East India Company.\r\n\r\n\r\nHORNIGOLD, CAPTAIN BENJAMIN.\r\n\r\nCommanded a sloop in 1716 and cruised off the Guinea coast with Teach,\r\ntaking a big French Guinea ship. He then sailed to the Bahama Islands,\r\nwhere, in 1718, Woodes Rogers had just arrived with the offer of a pardon\r\nto all pirates who surrendered themselves. Teach went off again \"on the\r\naccount,\" but Hornigold surrendered. Shortly afterwards Hornigold was\r\nwrecked on a reef and drowned.\r\n\r\n\r\nHOW, THOMAS.\r\n\r\nA native of Barnstaple in Devon.\r\n\r\nOne of Captain Bartholomew Roberts's crew. Condemned to death for piracy,\r\nbut reprieved and sold to the Royal African Company to work on their\r\nplantations for seven years.\r\n\r\n\r\nHOWARD, THOMAS.\r\n\r\nBorn in London, the son of a Thames lighterman. Sailing to Jamaica, he\r\ndeserted his ship and, with some companions of a like mind, stole a canoe\r\nand set off to the Grand Cayman Islands, and there met with some 200\r\nbuccaneers and pirates. Joining with these, they took several vessels,\r\nlastly a well-armed Spanish ship. In her they cruised off the coast of\r\nVirginia, taking a large New England brigantine, of which Howard was\r\nappointed quartermaster. Their next prize was a fine Virginian galley,\r\ntwenty-four guns, crowded with convicts being transplanted to America.\r\nThese passengers were only too willing to join the pirates.\r\n\r\nNext, they sailed away to Guinea, where they took numerous prizes. Here\r\nthey were attacked by a big Portuguese ship of thirty-six guns, which they\r\ndefeated. Having by now got together a well appointed pirate fleet, they\r\nsailed round the Cape of Good Hope to Madagascar, the happy home of the\r\nSouth Sea pirates. Their ship, the _Alexander_, was wrecked and lost on a\r\nreef, and Howard, together with the English and Dutch members of the crew,\r\nseized the treasure, and drove off the Portuguese and Spanish sailors and\r\nalso the captain, and got to shore in a boat. They then broke up their\r\nship, and lived for a while by fishing and hunting. On one of these\r\nhunting parties, the men ran away and left Howard behind.\r\n\r\nHoward was found by the King of Anquala, who took care of him until he was\r\npicked up by a ship. Later on, Howard became captain of a fine vessel, the\r\n_Prosperous_, thirty-six guns, which he and some other pirates had seized\r\nat Madagascar. In her, Howard went cruising, eventually in company with\r\nCaptain Bowen, attacking a Moorish fleet off St. John's Island. Howard\r\nfollowed the Moorish ships up a river, and, after a fierce fight, seized\r\nthe largest and richest prize, a ship containing upward of a million\r\ndollars worth of goods. Howard, having now made a considerable fortune,\r\nretired from the piratical life and went to India, and there married a\r\nnative woman and settled down. Howard, who was a morose, sour kind of man,\r\nill-treated his wife, and he was at length murdered by some of her\r\nrelations.\r\n\r\n\r\nHUGGIT, THOMAS.\r\n\r\nOf London.\r\n\r\nHanged at Newport, Rhode Island, in July, 1723. Age 30.\r\n\r\n\r\nHULL, CAPTAIN EDWARD.\r\n\r\nCommanded the _Swallow_ \"frigott\" in which he sailed from Boston in 1653,\r\nand captured several French and Dutch ships. He afterwards sold his\r\nvessels and went with his share of the plunder to England, where he\r\nsettled down.\r\n\r\n\r\nHUNTER, ANDREW.\r\n\r\nOne of Captain Lowther's crew. Hanged at St. Kitts on March 11th, 1722.\r\n\r\n\r\nHUSK, JOHN.\r\n\r\nOne of Blackbeard's crew in the _Queen Ann's Revenge_. Killed off North\r\nCarolina in 1718.\r\n\r\n\r\nHUTNOT, JOSEPH.\r\n\r\nOne of the crew of the notorious brigantine _Charles_, commanded by\r\nCaptain Quelch. Tried for piracy at the Star Tavern, Boston, in 1704.\r\n\r\n\r\nHUTT, CAPTAIN GEORGE, or HOUT. Buccaneer.\r\n\r\nAn Englishman who succeeded Captain Townley when the latter was killed\r\nduring a gallant fight with three Spanish galleons in 1686 near Panama.\r\n\r\n\r\nINGRAM, GUNNER WILLIAM.\r\n\r\nWas one of Captain Anstis's crew in the _Good Fortune_ when that pirate\r\ntook the _Morning Star_. After the prize had been converted to the\r\npirates' use, Ingram was appointed gunner. Later, when Ingram came to be\r\ntried for piracy, evidence was produced to prove that he had joined the\r\npirates of his own free will, and, in fact, had on all occasions been one\r\nof the forwardest in any action, and altogether \"a very resolute hardened\r\nFellow.\" He was hanged.\r\n\r\n\r\nIRELAND, JOHN. Pirate.\r\n\r\n\"A wicked and ill-disposed person,\" according to the royal warrant of King\r\nWilliam III. granted to \"our truly and dearly beloved Captain William\r\nKidd\" to go in the year 1695 to seize this and other pirates who were\r\ndoing great mischief to the ships trading off the coast of North America.\r\n\r\n\r\nIRVINE, CAPTAIN.\r\n\r\nOne of the last pirates in the Atlantic. Very active in the early part of\r\nthe nineteenth century.\r\n\r\n\r\nJACKMAN, CAPTAIN. Buccaneer.\r\n\r\nIn 1665 took part with Morris and Morgan in a very successful raid on\r\nCentral America, ascending the river Tabasco in the province of Campeachy\r\nwith only 107 men. Led by Indians by a detour of 300 miles, they surprised\r\nand sacked the town of Villa de Mosa. Dampier describes this small town as\r\n\"standing on the starboard side of the river, inhabited chiefly by\r\nIndians, with some Spaniards.\" On their return to the mouth of the river,\r\nJackman's party found the Spaniards had seized their ship, and some three\r\nhundred of them attacked the pirates, but the Spaniards were easily beaten\r\noff.\r\n\r\nThe freebooters next attacked Rio Garta, and took it with only thirty men,\r\ncrossed the Gulf of Honduras to rest on the Island of Roatan, and then\r\nproceeded to the Port of Truxillo, which they plundered. They next sailed\r\ndown the Mosquito coast, burning and pillaging as they went.\r\n\r\nAnchoring in Monkey Bay, they ascended the San Juan River in canoes one\r\nhundred miles to Lake Nicaragua. The pirates described the Lake of\r\nNicaragua as being a veritable paradise, which, indeed, it must have been\r\nprior to their visit. Hiding by day amongst the many islands and rowing by\r\nnight, on the fifth night they landed near the city of Granada, just one\r\nyear after Mansfield's visit. The buccaneers marched right into the\r\ncentral square of the city without being observed by the Spaniards, who\r\nwere taken completely by surprise, so that the English were soon masters\r\nof the city, and for sixteen hours they plundered it. Some 1,000 Indians,\r\ndriven to rebellion by the cruelty and oppression of the Spaniards,\r\naccompanied the marauders and wanted to massacre the prisoners,\r\nparticularly \"the religious,\" but when they understood that the buccaneers\r\nwere not remaining in Granada, they thought better of it, having, no\r\ndoubt, a shrewd inkling of what to expect in the future when their\r\nrescuers had left.\r\n\r\n\r\nJACKSON, CAPTAIN WILLIAM. Buccaneer.\r\n\r\nIn 1642 he gathered together a crew of more than a thousand buccaneers in\r\nthe Islands of St. Kitts and Barbadoes, and sailed with these in three\r\nships to the Spanish Main, plundering Maracaibo and Truxillo.\r\n\r\nOn March 25th, 1643, Jackson's little fleet dropped anchor in the harbour,\r\nwhat was afterwards to be known as Kingston, in the Island of Jamaica,\r\nwhich was then still in the possession of Spain. Landing 500 of his men,\r\nhe attacked the town of St. Jago de la Vega, which he took after a hard\r\nfight and with the loss of some forty of his men. For sparing the town\r\nfrom fire he received ransom from the Spaniards of 200 beeves, 10,000\r\npounds of cassava bread, and 7,000 pieces of eight. The English sailors\r\nwere so delighted by the beauty of the island that in one night\r\ntwenty-three of them deserted to the Spaniards.\r\n\r\n\r\nJACKSON, NATHANIEL.\r\n\r\nOne of Captain Edward Teach's crew. Killed at North Carolina in 1718.\r\n\r\n\r\nJAMES, CAPTAIN. Buccaneer.\r\n\r\nBelonged to Jamaica and Tortuga. In 1663 was in command of a frigate, the\r\n_American_ (six guns, crew of seventy men).\r\n\r\n\r\nJAMES, CAPTAIN.\r\n\r\nA buccaneer captain who was in 1640 temporarily appointed \"President\" of\r\nTortuga Island by the Providence Company, while their regular Governor,\r\nCaptain Flood, was in London, clearing himself of charges preferred\r\nagainst him by the planters.\r\n\r\n\r\nJAMES, CAPTAIN.\r\n\r\nAbout 1709 commanded a pirate brigantine off Madagascar. Sailed for some\r\ntime in company with a New York pirate called Ort Van Tyle.\r\n\r\n\r\nJAMES, CHARLES.\r\n\r\nOne of Captain John Quelch's crew taken in the _Larimore_ galley at Salem.\r\nTried for piracy at Boston in 1704.\r\n\r\n\r\nJAMISON, _alias_ MONACRE NICKOLA.\r\n\r\nBorn at Greenock in Scotland, the son of a rich cloth merchant, he\r\nreceived a polite education, spoke several languages, and was described as\r\nbeing of gentlemanly deportment.\r\n\r\nHe served as sailing-master to Captain Jonnia when he took the schooner\r\n_Exertion_. The captain and crew were eventually saved by Nickola. Years\r\nafterwards Nickola went to Boston, and lived with Captain Lincoln of the\r\n_Exertion_, and made a living by fishing for mackerel in the warm season,\r\nand during the winter by teaching navigation to young gentlemen.\r\n\r\n\r\nJANQUAIS, CAPTAIN.\r\n\r\nA French filibuster of San Domingo.\r\n\r\nHis ship, _La Dauphine_, carried thirty guns and a crew of 180 men.\r\n\r\n\r\nJEFFERYS, BENJAMIN.\r\n\r\nOf Bristol.\r\n\r\nTaken by Roberts in the _Norman_ galley in April, 1721. Roberts allowed\r\nthose of the crew who did not wish to join the pirates to return to the\r\n_Norman_, but Jefferys had made such friends on the pirate ship that he\r\nwas too drunk to go, and also was abusive in his cups, telling his hosts\r\nthere was not one man amongst them. For this he received six lashes with\r\nthe cat-o'-nine-tails from every member of the crew, \"which disordered him\r\nfor some weeks.\" But Jefferys eventually proved himself a brisk and\r\nwilling lad, and was made bos'on's mate. He was hanged a year later at the\r\nage of 21.\r\n\r\n\r\nJENNINGS.\r\n\r\nA Welshman who in 1613 was settled on the Barbary coast with some thirty\r\nother British pirates.\r\n\r\n\r\nJENNINGS, CAPTAIN.\r\n\r\nThis Welsh pirate had been a man of good position, education, and property\r\nbefore he took to piracy, which he did for the love of the life and not\r\nfrom necessity. He was held in high esteem by his fellow-pirates at their\r\nstronghold in the Bahamas. When notice was brought of King George's pardon\r\nin 1717, a meeting was held of all the pirates at which Jennings presided.\r\nAfter much discussion, Jennings boldly gave out that he himself meant to\r\nsurrender, whereupon some hundred and fifty other pirates declared their\r\nintention of doing likewise. On the new Governor's arrival from England\r\nthey received their certificates, though the greater part of them soon\r\nwent back to piracy, or, to quote the expressive Captain Johnson,\r\n\"returned again like the Dog to the Vomit.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nJOBSON, RICHARD, or COBSON or GOPSON.\r\n\r\nHis original calling was that of a druggist's assistant in London. He\r\ncombined piracy with the study of divinity. He was one of Dampier's party\r\nwhich crossed the Isthmus of Darien in 1681, and was left behind with\r\nWafer, who tells us in his book that Gopson \"was an ingenious man and a\r\ngood scholar, and had with him a Greek testament which he frequently read\r\nand would translate extempore into English to such of the company as were\r\ndisposed to hear him.\"\r\n\r\nAfter great sufferings in the tropical jungle in the wet season, Jobson\r\nand his friends reached the \"North Sea\" to find an English buccaneer\r\nvessel lying at anchor off the shore. On rowing out to the ship the canoe\r\nupset, and Jobson and his gun were thrown overboard, but the former was\r\nrescued, though he died a few days later on board the vessel owing to the\r\nexposure he had been subjected to. He was buried in the sand at Le Sounds\r\nCay with full honours--that is, a volley of guns and colours flown at\r\nhalf-mast.\r\n\r\n\r\nJOCARD, LE CAPITAINE.\r\n\r\nA French filibuster who in 1684 had his headquarters in San Domingo.\r\n\r\nHe commanded the _Irondelle_, a ship armed with eighteen guns and a crew\r\nof 120 men.\r\n\r\n\r\nJOHNSON, CAPTAIN. A successful and very bloody pirate.\r\n\r\nOf Jamaica.\r\n\r\nImmediately after the publication of peace by Sir Thomas Lynch, Governor\r\nof Jamaica in 1670, which included a general pardon to all privateers,\r\nJohnson fled from Port Royal with some ten followers, and shortly after,\r\nmeeting with a Spanish ship of eighteen guns, managed to take her and kill\r\nthe captain and fourteen of the crew. Gradually collecting together a\r\nparty of a hundred or more English and French desperadoes he plundered\r\nmany ships round the Cuban coast. Tiring of his quarrelsome French\r\ncompanions he sailed to Jamaica to make terms with the Governor, and\r\nanchored in Morant Bay, but his ship was blown ashore by a hurricane.\r\nJohnson was immediately arrested by Governor Lynch, who ordered Colonel\r\nModyford to assemble the justices and to proceed to trial and immediate\r\nexecution. Lynch had had bitter experiences of trying pirates, and knew\r\nthat the sooner they were hanged the better. But Modyford, like many other\r\nJamaicans, felt a strong sympathy for the pirates, and he managed to get\r\nJohnson acquitted in spite of the fact that Johnson \"confessed enough to\r\nhang a hundred honester persons.\" It is interesting to read that half an\r\nhour after the dismissal of the court Johnson \"came to drink with his\r\njudges.\" Governor Lynch, now thoroughly roused, took the matter into his\r\nown hands. He again placed Johnson under arrest, called a meeting of the\r\ncouncil, from which he dismissed Colonel Modyford, and managed to have the\r\nformer judgment reversed. The pirate was again tried, and in order that no\r\nmistake might happen, Lynch himself presided over the court. Johnson, as\r\nbefore, made a full confession, but was condemned and immediately\r\nexecuted, and was, writes Lynch, \"as much regretted as if he had been as\r\npious and as innocent as one of the primitive martyrs.\" This second trial\r\nwas absolutely illegal, and Lynch was reproved by the King for his rash\r\nand high-handed conduct.\r\n\r\n\r\nJOHNSON, CAPTAIN BEN.\r\n\r\nWhen a lad he had served as a midshipman in an East Indiaman, the _Asia_,\r\nbut having been caught red-handed robbing the purser of brandy and wine,\r\nhe was flogged and sent to serve as a sailor before the mast. In 1750,\r\nwhile in the Red Sea, he deserted his ship and entered the service of the\r\nSultan of Ormus. Finding Johnson to be a clever sailor, the Sultan\r\nappointed him admiral of his pirate fleet of fourteen vessels. The young\r\nadmiral became a convert to Brahminism, and was ceremoniously blessed by\r\nthe arch-priests of the Temple. Amongst his crew Johnson had some two\r\nhundred other Englishmen, who also became followers of Brahmin, each of\r\nwhom was allowed, when in port, a dancing girl from the Temple.\r\n\r\nJohnson proved a most capable and bloodthirsty pirate, playing havoc with\r\nthe shipping of the Red Sea, taking also several towns on the coast, and\r\nputting to death his prisoners, often after cruel tortures. His boldest\r\nexploit was to attack the fortified town of Busrah. This he did, putting\r\nthe Sheik and most of the inhabitants to death, and taking back to his\r\nmaster, the Sultan, vast plunder of diamonds, pearls, and gold.\r\n\r\nOn another occasion Johnson landed his crews on the Island of Omalee, at\r\nthe entrance to the Persian Gulf, a favourite place of pilgrimage, and\r\nraided the temples of the Indian God Buddha. Putting to death all the two\r\nthousand priests, he cut off the noses and slit the upper lips of seven\r\nhundred dancing girls, only sparing a few of the best looking ones, whom\r\nhe carried away with him along with plunder worth half a million rupees.\r\n\r\nOn their way back to the Red Sea the pirates met with an English East\r\nIndiaman, which they took and plundered, and Johnson, remembering his\r\nprevious sufferings in the same service, murdered the whole crew.\r\n\r\nShortly afterwards Johnson and ten of his English officers contrived to\r\nrun away from their master, the Sultan, in his best and fastest lateen\r\nvessel, with an enormous booty. Sailing up to the head of the Persian\r\nGulf, Johnson managed to reach Constantinople with his share of the\r\nplunder, worth £800,000. With this as an introduction, he was hospitably\r\nreceived, and was made a bashaw, and at the end of a long life of\r\nsplendour died a natural death.\r\n\r\n\r\nJOHNSON, CAPTAIN HENRY, _alias_ \"HENRIQUES THE ENGLISHMAN.\"\r\n\r\nA West Indian pirate, born in the North of Ireland.\r\n\r\nCommanded the _Two Brothers_, a Rhode Island-built sloop, eighteen guns,\r\ncrew of ninety, mostly Spaniards. On March 20th, 1730, he took the _John\r\nand Jane_ (Edward Burt, master), from Jamaica, off Swan Island. The _John\r\nand Jane_ was armed with eight carriage and ten swivel guns, and a crew of\r\nonly twenty-five men. After a gallant resistance for five hours the\r\npirates boarded and took the English ship. The few survivors were stripped\r\nnaked, and preparations made to hang them in pairs. This was prevented by\r\nCaptain Johnson and an English pirate called Echlin. There was a Mrs.\r\nGroves, a passenger, in the _John and Jane_, whose husband and the English\r\nsurgeon had both been killed at the first onslaught of the pirates. This\r\npoor lady was hidden in the hold of the ship during the action, and was\r\nonly informed afterwards of the death of her husband. The pirates now\r\ndragged her on deck, \"stript her in a manner naked,\" and carried her as a\r\nprize to the Spanish captain, Pedro Poleas, who immediately took her to\r\nthe \"great cabin and there with horrible oaths and curses insolently\r\nassaulted her Chastity.\" Her loud cries of distress brought Captain\r\nJohnson into the cabin, who, seeing what was on hand, drew his pistol and\r\nthreatened to blow out the brains of any man who attempted the least\r\nviolence upon her. He next commanded everything belonging to Mrs. Groves\r\nto be returned to her, which was done--including her clothing. The gallant\r\nconduct of Johnson is the more surprising and pleasing since he had the\r\nreputation of being as bloody and ruthless a pirate as ever took a ship or\r\ncut an innocent throat. He only had one hand, and used to fire his piece\r\nwith great skill, laying the barrel on his stump, and drawing the trigger\r\nwith his right hand.\r\n\r\nIn all the American \"plantations\" there were rewards offered for him alive\r\nor dead.\r\n\r\nThe end of this \"penny-dreadful\" pirate is unrecorded, but was probably a\r\nviolent one, as this type of pirate seldom, if ever, died in his bed.\r\n\r\n\r\nJOHNSON, ISAAC.\r\n\r\nOne of Captain Quelch's crew. Tried for piracy at the Star Tavern at\r\nBoston in 1704.\r\n\r\n\r\nJOHNSON, JACOB.\r\n\r\nTaken prisoner by Captain Roberts out of the _King Solomon_, he joined the\r\npirates.\r\n\r\n\r\nJOHNSON, JOHN, or JAYNSON.\r\n\r\nBorn \"nigh Lancaster.\"\r\n\r\nTaken out of the _King Solomon_. One of Roberts's crew. Hanged in 1722 at\r\nthe age of 22.\r\n\r\n\r\nJOHNSON, MARCUS.\r\n\r\nOne of Captain Roberts's crew. Hanged in 1722. Stated in his death warrant\r\nto be a native of Smyrna. Died at the age of 21.\r\n\r\n\r\nJOHNSON, ROBERT.\r\n\r\nFrom Whydah in West Africa.\r\n\r\nTried for piracy with the rest of Captain Roberts's crew, and hanged in\r\n1722 at the age of 32. At his trial he pleaded that he did not enter with\r\nthe pirates of his own free will, and called witnesses to prove that at\r\nthe time he was captured he was so very drunk that he had to be hoisted\r\nout of his own ship, the _Jeremiah and Ann_, into the pirate ship in\r\ntackles.\r\n\r\n\r\nJOHNSTON, THOMAS.\r\n\r\nOf Boston.\r\n\r\nKnown as \"the limping privateer.\" Sailed with Captain Pound. Wounded in\r\nthe jaw in the fight at Tarpaulin Cove. Tried for piracy at Boston, and\r\nhanged on January 27th, 1690.\r\n\r\n\r\nJONES, CAPTAIN PAUL.\r\n\r\nProbably few persons, even in Great Britain, would to-day call Paul Jones\r\na pirate, but this was not always the case. In all books on pirates\r\nwritten shortly after the American war, Paul Jones figured as a notorious\r\ncharacter.\r\n\r\nThis famous privateer, let us call him, was born at Kirkcudbright in\r\nScotland in 1728, the son of Mr. Paul, head gardener to Lord Selkirk, and\r\nwas christened John Paul. So much has been written about this man in\r\nbooks, easily procurable for reference, that little need be said about him\r\nhere.\r\n\r\nStarting life as a sailor before the mast, he quickly showed abilities\r\nwhich led to his promotion to the rank of mate in an English ship trading\r\nin the West India Islands, and later he was made master. On the\r\ndeclaration of war with America, Jones joined the rebels, and was given\r\ncommand of a privateer, and from 1777 he became a terror to English\r\nshipping around the British Isles.\r\n\r\nOne of his most startling exploits was his surprise visit in his ship, the\r\n_Ranger_, to his old home with the object of kidnapping his former\r\nemployer, Lord Selkirk.\r\n\r\nOn September 23rd, 1779, he fought his famous action off Scarborough\r\nagainst a British convoy from the Baltic under the command of Captain\r\nPearson, in the _Serapis_, and Captain Piercy in the _Countess of\r\nScarborough_. Jones had left the _Ranger_ for a frigate called the _Bonne\r\nHomme Richard_ of forty guns and a crew of three hundred and seventy men,\r\nand had also under his command four other ships of war. A furious\r\nengagement took place, the utmost bravery being shown on either side; the\r\nEnglish ships at last being compelled to surrender, but not until the\r\nenemy had themselves suffered fearful damage to both their crews and\r\nships. After the conclusion of peace, Paul Jones, once the darling of two\r\ncontinents, faded into obscurity and even poverty, and died in Paris in\r\nthe year 1792 at the age of 64.\r\n\r\n\r\nJONES. SEAMAN.\r\n\r\nA mariner. \"A brisk young fellow\" who served with Captain Bartholomew\r\nRoberts's crew. On one occasion Captain Roberts had reason to think that\r\none of his men had spoken disrespectfully to him, so, as a warning to the\r\nrest, he killed him. The dead man's greatest friend was Jones, who,\r\nhearing what had happened, had a fierce fight with Roberts. This severe\r\nbreach of discipline was punished by Jones receiving two lashes on the\r\nback from every man on board. Jones after this sailed with Captain Anstis\r\nin the _Good Fortune_.\r\n\r\n\r\nJONES, THOMAS.\r\n\r\nFound to be \"not guilty\" at a trial for piracy at Newport, Rhode Island,\r\nin 1723. One of Captain Charles Harris's crew. Age 17.\r\n\r\n\r\nJONES, WILLIAM.\r\n\r\nTried for piracy at Boston, 1704.\r\n\r\n\r\nJONES, WILLIAM.\r\n\r\nOf London.\r\n\r\nAge 28. Hanged at Rhode Island, 1723.\r\n\r\n\r\nJONNIA, CAPTAIN.\r\n\r\nA Spaniard.\r\n\r\nCommanded in 1821 a fast schooner, carrying a crew of forty men, armed\r\nwith muskets, cutlasses, blunderbusses, long knives, dirks, two\r\ncarronades--one a twelve, the other a six-pounder. They had aboard with\r\nthem three Mexican negresses. The pirates took and plundered the Boston\r\nschooner _Exertion_, on December 17th, 1821, the crew being considerably\r\ndrunk at the time. The plunder they took to Principe in the Island of\r\nCuba. The pirates took everything from their prisoners, even their\r\nclothes, but as a parting gift sent the captain a copy of the \"Family\r\nPrayer Book\" by the Rev. Mr. Brooks. The prisoners were marooned on a\r\nsmall mangrove quay, but they eventually escaped. Jonnia and some of his\r\ncrew were afterwards captured by an English ship and taken to Kingston,\r\nJamaica, and there hanged.\r\n\r\n\r\nJOSE, MIGUEL.\r\n\r\nHanged at Kingston, Jamaica, in February, 1823. This old man's last words\r\non the scaffold were: \"No he robado, no he matado ningune, muero\r\ninnocente.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nJUDSON, RANDALL.\r\n\r\nOne of Captain Roderigo's crew. Tried for piracy at Cambridge,\r\nMassachusetts, in June, 1675, and sentenced to be hanged; \"presently after\r\nthe lecture,\" which was delivered by the Rev. Increase Mather. Afterwards\r\npardoned, but fined and banished from the colony.\r\n\r\n\r\nKELLWANTON.\r\n\r\nA notorious pirate in the sixteenth century. Was captured in the Isle of\r\nMan in 1531.\r\n\r\n\r\nKENNEDY, CAPTAIN.\r\n\r\nBegan life as a pickpocket and housebreaker in London. He was Captain\r\nRoberts's lieutenant, and was afterwards given command of a prize, the\r\n_Rover_.\r\n\r\nKennedy could never, even when a captain, forget his old trade. It is\r\nrecorded that he stole a black suit of clothes from the captain of the\r\n_Bird_ at Sierra Leone in 1718. These he put on with the captain's best\r\nwig and sword. He then swaggered about on board in these till his\r\nfellow-pirates drenched him with buckets of claret, so that he had to\r\ndisrobe and throw the garments overboard.\r\n\r\nOwing to a quarrel with Captain Roberts, Kennedy went off in his ship, the\r\n_Rover_, and sailed to Barbadoes. His first prize, a Boston ship, was a\r\ndistinct novelty, being commanded by one Captain Knot, a Quaker, who lived\r\nup to the principles of his sect by allowing no pistol, sword, or cutlass,\r\nor other weapon aboard his vessel. The crew, finding Kennedy had no\r\nknowledge whatever of navigation, threatened to throw him overboard, but\r\nbecause he was a man of great personal courage they did not in the end\r\ncarry out their threat. The crew next decided to give over piracy and to\r\nset sail for Ireland. This island they altogether missed through bad\r\nnavigation, and they ran the ship ashore on the north of Scotland. The\r\ncrew landed and passed themselves off as shipwrecked mariners, but owing\r\nto their drinking and rioting in each village they came to, the whole\r\ncountryside was soon roused. Kennedy slipped away and reached Ireland.\r\nHaving soon spent all his ill-gotten gains in Dublin, he came to Deptford\r\nand set up a house of ill-fame, adding occasionally to his income from\r\nthis source by a little highwaymanry. One of the ladies of his house at\r\nDeptford, to be revenged for some slight or other, gave information to the\r\nwatch, and Kennedy was imprisoned at Marshalsea and afterwards tried for\r\nrobbery and piracy. Kennedy turned King's evidence against some of his old\r\nassociates, but this did not save his neck, for he was condemned and\r\nhanged at Execution Dock.\r\n\r\n\r\nKHEYR-ED-DIN. Corsair.\r\n\r\nBrother of the famous Barbarossa. When the latter was defeated and killed\r\nby the Spaniards, Kheyr-ed-din sent an ambassador to Constantinople,\r\nbegging for help to protect Algiers. He was appointed Governor of Algiers\r\nby the Sultan of Turkey in 1519. Now greatly increased both in ships and\r\npower, he scoured the whole Mediterranean for Italian and Spanish prizes.\r\nHe raided the Spanish coast and carried off slaves from the Balearic\r\nIslands. He next took and destroyed the fortress of Algiers, and employed\r\n7,000 Christian slaves to build a new one and also a great mole to protect\r\nthe harbour. Invited by Solyman the Magnificent to help him against the\r\nChristian Admiral Andria Doria, in August, 1533, he sailed from Algiers\r\nwith his fleet, being joined on the way by another noted corsair,\r\nDelizuff.\r\n\r\nA year afterwards, at the age of 73, Kheyr-ed-din set out from\r\nConstantinople with a vast fleet, sacking towns and burning all Christian\r\nships that were so unfortunate as to fall in his way. He returned to the\r\nBosphorus with huge spoil and 11,000 prisoners. He sacked Sardinia, then\r\nsailed to Tunis, which he vanquished.\r\n\r\nCharles V. of Spain now began to collect a large fleet and an army of\r\n25,000 men and sailed to Tunis. A fierce fight followed; the Christians\r\nbroke into the town, massacred the inhabitants and rescued some 20,000\r\nChristian slaves. Kheyr-ed-din escaped with a few followers, but soon was\r\nin command of a fleet of pirate galleys once more. A terrific but\r\nundecisive naval battle took place off Prevesa between the Mohammedans and\r\nthe Christians, the fleet of the latter being under the command of Andrea\r\nDoria; and Kheyr-ed-din died shortly afterwards at Constantinople at a\r\ngreat age.\r\n\r\n\r\nKIDD, CAPTAIN WILLIAM, sometimes ROBERT KIDD or KID.\r\n\r\nIn the whole history of piracy there is no name that has so taken the\r\nworld's fancy than has that of William Kidd. And yet, if he be judged by\r\nhis actions as a pirate, he must be placed amongst the second- or even\r\nthird-rate masters of that craft. He took but two or three ships, and\r\nthese have been, after two hundred years, proved to be lawful prizes taken\r\nin his legal capacity as a privateer.\r\n\r\nKidd was born at Greenock in Scotland about the year 1655, and was the son\r\nof the Rev. John Kidd. Of his early life little record is left, but we\r\nknow that in August, 1689, he arrived at St. Nevis in the West Indies, in\r\ncommand of a privateer of sixteen guns. In 1691, while Kidd was on shore,\r\nhis crew ran away with his ship, which was not surprising, as most of his\r\ncrew were old pirates. But that Kidd was an efficient seaman and a capable\r\ncaptain is shown by the number of times he was given the command of\r\ndifferent privateer vessels, both by the Government of New York and by\r\nprivateer owners.\r\n\r\nIn 1695 Kidd was in London, and on October 10th signed the articles which\r\nwere to prove so fatal for him. In January, 1696, King William III. issued\r\nto his \"beloved friend William Kidd\" a commission to apprehend certain\r\npirates, particularly Thomas Tew, of Rhode Island, Thomas Wake, and\r\nWilliam Maze, of New York, John Ireland, and \"all other Pirates,\r\nFree-booters, and Sea Rovers of what Nature soever.\"\r\n\r\nThis privateer enterprise was financed chiefly by Lord Bellomont, but the\r\nother adventurers (on shore and in safety) were the Lord Chancellor; the\r\nEarl of Orford, the First Lord of the Admiralty; the Earl of Romney and\r\nthe Duke of Shrewsbury, Secretaries of State; Robert Livingston, Esq., of\r\nNew York; and lastly, Captain Kidd himself.\r\n\r\nThe ship the _Adventure_ galley was bought and fitted up, and Kidd sailed\r\naway in her to suppress piracy, particularly on the coast of America.\r\nNothing was heard of him till August, 1698, when ugly rumours began to get\r\nabout of piracies committed by Kidd in the Indian Ocean. In December of\r\nthe same year a general pardon was offered to all pirates who should\r\nsurrender themselves, with two exceptions--namely, Captain Avery and\r\nCaptain Kidd. In May, 1699, Kidd suddenly appeared in a small vessel at\r\nNew York, with rich booty. His chief patron, Lord Bellomont, was now\r\nGovernor, and was placed in the most awkward position of having to carry\r\nout his orders and arrest Kidd for piracy and send him in chains to\r\nEngland in H.M.S. _Advice_, which ship had been sent specially to New York\r\nto carry back Kidd, Bradish, and other pirates to England.\r\n\r\nThe trial of Kidd proved a scandal, for someone had to suffer as scapegoat\r\nfor the aristocratic company privateers, and the lot fell to the luckless\r\nKidd. Kidd was charged with piracy and with murder. The first charge of\r\nseizing two ships of the Great Mogul could have been met by the production\r\nof two documents which Kidd had taken out of these ships, and which, he\r\nclaimed, proved that the ships were sailing under commissions issued by\r\nthe French East India Company, and made them perfectly lawful prizes.\r\nThese commissions Kidd had most foolishly handed over to Lord Bellomont,\r\nand they could not be produced at the trial, although they had been\r\nexhibited before the House of Commons a little while previously.\r\n\r\nIt is an extraordinary and tragic fact that these two documents, so vital\r\nto Kidd, were discovered only lately in the Public Records Office--too\r\nlate, by some 200 years, to save an innocent man's life.\r\n\r\nAs it happened, the charge of which Kidd was hanged for was murder, and\r\nran thus: \"Being moved and seduced by the instigations of the Devil he did\r\nmake an assault in and upon William Moore upon the high seas with a\r\ncertain wooden bucket, bound with iron hoops, of the value of eight pence,\r\ngiving the said William Moore one mortal bruise of which the aforesaid\r\nWilliam Moore did languish and die.\" This aforesaid William Moore was\r\ngunner in the _Adventure_ galley, and was mutinous, and Kidd, as captain,\r\nwas perfectly justified in knocking him down and even of killing him; but\r\nas the court meant Kidd to \"swing,\" this was quite good enough for finding\r\nhim guilty. The unfortunate prisoner was executed at Wapping on May 23rd,\r\n1701, and his body afterwards hanged in chains at Tilbury.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A PIRATE BEING HANGED AT EXECUTION DOCK, WAPPING.\r\n\r\nTo face p. 182.]\r\n\r\nA popular ballad was sung to commemorate the life and death of Kidd, who,\r\nfor some reason, was always called Robert Kidd by the populace. It\r\nconsists of no less than twenty-four verses, and we here give fifteen of\r\nthem:\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE BALLAD OF CAPTAIN KIDD\r\n\r\n    My name was Robert Kidd, when I sailed, when I sailed,\r\n        My name was Robert Kidd, when I sailed,\r\n            My name was Robert Kidd,\r\n            God's laws I did forbid,\r\n    And so wickedly I did, when I sailed.\r\n\r\n    My parents taught me well, when I sailed, when I sailed,\r\n        My parents taught me well, when I sailed,\r\n            My parents taught me well,\r\n            To shun the gates of hell,\r\n    But 'gainst them I rebelled, when I sailed.\r\n\r\n    I'd a Bible in my hand, when I sailed, when I sailed,\r\n        I'd a Bible in my hand, when I sailed,\r\n            I'd a Bible in my hand,\r\n            By my father's great command,\r\n    And sunk it in the sand, when I sailed.\r\n\r\n    I murdered William Moore, as I sailed, as I sailed,\r\n        I murdered William Moore, as I sailed,\r\n            I murdered William Moore,\r\n            And laid him in his gore,\r\n    Not many leagues from shore, as I sailed.\r\n\r\n    I was sick and nigh to death, when I sailed, when I sailed,\r\n        I was sick and nigh to death, when I sailed,\r\n            I was sick and nigh to death,\r\n            And I vowed at every breath,\r\n    To walk in wisdom's ways, as I sailed.\r\n\r\n    I thought I was undone, as I sailed, as I sailed,\r\n        I thought I was undone, as I sailed,\r\n            I thought I was undone,\r\n            And my wicked glass had run,\r\n    But health did soon return, as I sailed.\r\n\r\n    My repentance lasted not, as I sailed, as I sailed,\r\n        My repentance lasted not, as I sailed,\r\n            My repentance lasted not,\r\n            My vows I soon forgot,\r\n    Damnation was my lot, as I sailed.\r\n\r\n    I spyed the ships from France, as I sailed, as I sailed,\r\n        I spyed the ships of France, as I sailed,\r\n            I spyed the ships from France,\r\n            To them I did advance,\r\n    And took them all by chance, as I sailed.\r\n\r\n    I spyed the ships of Spain, as I sailed, as I sailed,\r\n        I spyed the ships of Spain, as I sailed,\r\n            I spyed the ships of Spain,\r\n            I fired on them amain,\r\n    'Till most of them was slain, as I sailed.\r\n\r\n    I'd ninety bars of gold, as I sailed, as I sailed,\r\n        I'd ninety bars of gold, as I sailed,\r\n            I'd ninety bars of gold,\r\n            And dollars manifold,\r\n    With riches uncontrolled, as I sailed.\r\n\r\n    Thus being o'er-taken at last, I must die, I must die,\r\n        Thus being o'er-taken at last, I must die,\r\n            Thus being o'er-taken at last,\r\n            And into prison cast,\r\n    And sentence being passed, I must die.\r\n\r\n    Farewell, the raging main, I must die, I must die,\r\n        Farewell, the raging main, I must die,\r\n            Farewell, the raging main,\r\n            To Turkey, France and Spain,\r\n    I shall n'er see you again, I must die.\r\n\r\n    To Execution Dock I must go, I must go,\r\n        To Execution Dock I must go,\r\n            To Execution Dock,\r\n            Will many thousands flock,\r\n    But I must bear the shock, and must die.\r\n\r\n    Come all ye young and old, see me die, see me die,\r\n        Come all ye young and old, see me die,\r\n            Come all ye young and old,\r\n            You're welcome to my gold,\r\n    For by it I've lost my soul, and must die.\r\n\r\n    Take warning now by me, for I must die, for I must die,\r\n        Take warning now by me, for I must die,\r\n            Take warning now by me,\r\n            And shun bad company,\r\n    Lest you come to hell with me, for I die.\r\n\r\n\r\nKILLING, JAMES.\r\n\r\nOne of Major Stede Bonnet's crew, who gave evidence against him at his\r\ntrial at Charleston in 1718.\r\n\r\n\r\nKING, CHARLES.\r\n\r\nAttempted to escape in the _Larimore_ galley, but was captured and brought\r\ninto Salem. Tried at Boston with the rest of Quelch's crew in June, 1704.\r\n\r\n\r\nKING, FRANCIS.\r\n\r\nOne of Captain Quelch's crew captured in the _Larimore_ galley by Major\r\nSewall, and brought into Salem Harbour on June 11th, 1704. Tried at Boston\r\nand condemned to be hanged. Was reprieved while standing on the gallows.\r\n\r\n\r\nKING, JOHN.\r\n\r\nOne of Captain Quelch's crew taken out of the _Larimore_ galley. Tried at\r\nBoston in June, 1704.\r\n\r\n\r\nKING, MATTHEW.\r\n\r\nOf Jamaica.\r\n\r\nOne of Major Stede Bonnet's crew. Was hanged at Charleston, South\r\nCarolina, on November 8th, 1718, and buried in the marsh below low-water\r\nmark.\r\n\r\n\r\nKNEEVES, PETER.\r\n\r\nOf Exeter in Devon.\r\n\r\nSailed with Captain Charles Harris, and was tried for piracy with the rest\r\nof his crew at Rhode Island in 1723. Hanged at Newport at the age of 32.\r\n\r\n\r\nKNIGHT, CAPTAIN W. Buccaneer.\r\n\r\nIn 1686 Knight was cruising off the coast of Peru and Chile with Swan,\r\nTownley, and Davis. At the end of that year, having got a fair quantity of\r\nplunder, he sailed round the Horn to the West Indies.\r\n\r\n\r\nKNIGHT, CHRISTOPHER.\r\n\r\nOne of Captain Coward's crew. Tried for piracy at Boston in January, 1690,\r\nand found guilty, but afterwards reprieved.\r\n\r\n\r\nKNOT, CAPTAIN.\r\n\r\nAn old Massachusetts pirate who retired from the sea and was settled in\r\nBoston in 1699. His wife gave information to the Governor, the Earl of\r\nBellomont, of the whereabouts of a pirate called Gillam, who was \"wanted.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nKOXINGA. His real name was Kuo-hsing Yeh, Koxinga being the Portuguese\r\nversion.\r\n\r\nThe son of a Chinese pirate, Cheng Chih-lung, by a Japanese mother, he was\r\nborn in 1623.\r\n\r\nFrom early youth Koxinga was inspired with a hatred of the Manchus, who\r\nhad imprisoned his father.\r\n\r\nThe young pirate soon became so successful in his raids along the coast of\r\nChina that the Emperor resorted to the extraordinary expedient of ordering\r\nthe inhabitants of more than eighty seaboard towns to migrate ten miles\r\ninland, after destroying their homes.\r\n\r\nThere can be no doubt that Koxinga was a thorough-going cut-throat pirate,\r\nworked solely for his own ambitious ends and to satisfy his revengeful\r\nfeelings, but the fact that he fought against the alien conquerors, the\r\nDutch in Formosa, and defeated them, caused him to be regarded as a hero\r\npirate.\r\n\r\nHis father was executed at Peking, which only increased his bitterness\r\nagainst the reigning house. Koxinga made himself what was, to all intents\r\nand purposes, the ruler of Formosa, and the island became, through him,\r\npart of the Chinese Empire.\r\n\r\nAfter his death, which took place in 1662, he received official\r\ncanonization.\r\n\r\nThe direct descendant of Koxinga, the pirate, is one of the very few\r\nhereditary nobles in China.\r\n\r\n\r\nLACY, ABRAHAM.\r\n\r\nOf Devonshire.\r\n\r\nHanged at the age of 21 at Rhode Island in 1723.\r\n\r\n\r\nDU LAERQUERAC, CAPTAIN JOHN.\r\n\r\nThis Breton pirate was captured in 1537 by a Bristol seaman called John\r\nWynter. Du Laerquerac, with other pirates from Brittany, had been holding\r\nup ships on their way to the great fair of St. James at Bristol. On being\r\narrested, he denied that he had \"spoiled\" any English ships, but on being\r\nfurther pressed to confess, admitted that he had taken a few odds and\r\nends, such as ropes, sailors' clothes, some wine, fish, a gold crown in\r\nmoney and eleven silver halfpence, as well as four daggers and a\r\n\"couverture.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nLAFITTE, CAPTAIN JEAN.\r\n\r\nJean and his brother first appeared in New Orleans in the year 1809.\r\nThough blacksmiths by profession, they soon took to smuggling goods\r\nbrought by privateersmen and pirates. The headquarters of this trade was\r\non the Island of Grande Terre in Barataria Bay. This island was inhabited\r\nand governed by ex-pirates; one Grambo being the acknowledged chief, until\r\nhe was shot by Jean Lafitte.\r\n\r\nIn 1813, the Baratarians were denounced by the Governor of Louisiana as\r\npirates. This made no difference to the pirate smugglers, who grew more\r\nand more rich and insolent. The Governor then secured an indictment\r\nagainst Jean and his brother, Pierre, who retained the very best and most\r\nexpensive lawyers in the State to defend them, and they were acquitted. In\r\n1814, war was declared with England, and Jean was invited by the English\r\nto fight on their side, with the offer of a commission in the navy and a\r\nlarge sum of money. He refused this, and eventually General Jackson\r\naccepted his offer of the services of himself and his Baratarians, who\r\nproved invaluable in the Battle of Orleans, serving the guns. He\r\ndisappeared completely after the war until 1823, when a British sloop of\r\nwar captured a pirate ship with a crew of sixty men under the command of\r\nthe famous Lafitte, who was amongst those who fell fighting.\r\n\r\n\r\nLAGARDE, LE CAPITAINE.\r\n\r\nA French filibuster of San Domingo, who in 1684 commanded a small ship,\r\n_La Subtille_ (crew of thirty men and two guns).\r\n\r\n\r\nLAMBERT, JOHN.\r\n\r\nOne of Captain John Quelch's crew. Hanged on Charles River, Boston Side,\r\non Friday, June 30th, 1704. In a broadside published at Boston in July of\r\nthe same year, Lambert's conduct on the gallows is described thus: \"He\r\nappeared much hardened and pleaded much on his Innocency. He desired all\r\nmen to beware of Bad Company and seemed to be in great Agony near his\r\nExecution.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nLANDER, DANIEL.\r\n\r\nOne of Captain Pound's crew.\r\n\r\n\r\nLANDRESSON, CAPTAIN MICHEL, _alias_ BREHA.\r\n\r\nFilibuster.\r\n\r\nAccompanied Pain in his expedition against St. Augustine in 1683. He was a\r\nconstant source of annoyance to the Jamaicans. His ship was called _La\r\nTrompeuse_, but must not be confused with the famous ship of that name\r\nbelonging to Hamlin. Landresson, when he had got a good booty of gold,\r\njewels, cocoa, etc., would go to Boston to dispose of it to the godly\r\nmerchants of New England. In 1684 a Royal proclamation was published in\r\nMassachusetts, warning all Governors that no succour or aid was to be\r\ngiven to any of the outlaws, but, in spite of this, Landresson was\r\nreceived with open arms and the proclamations in the streets torn down.\r\n\r\nIn 1684 he was at San Domingo, in command of _La Fortune_ (crew of 100\r\nmen and fourteen guns). At this time the filibuster was disguised under\r\nthe _alias_ of Le Capitaine Breha.\r\n\r\nCaptured in 1686 by the Armada de Barlorento, and hanged with several of\r\nhis companions.\r\n\r\n\r\nLANE, CAPTAIN.\r\n\r\nIn 1720 Lane was one of Captain England's crew when he took the _Mercury_\r\noff the coast of West Africa. The _Mercury_ was fitted up as a pirate\r\nship, named the _Queen Ann's Revenge_, and Lane was voted captain of her.\r\nLane left Captain England and sailed to Brazil, where he took several\r\nPortuguese ships and did a great deal of mischief.\r\n\r\n\r\nLARIMORE, CAPTAIN THOMAS, or LARRAMORE.\r\n\r\nCommanded the _Larimore_ galley. In 1704 was with the pirate Quelch and\r\nseveral other pirates, and, among other prizes, seized a Portuguese ship,\r\nthe _Portugal_, from which they took gold dust, bar and coined gold, and\r\nother treasure, and at the same time \"acted divers villainous Murders.\"\r\nFor these Larimore was tried, condemned and hanged at Boston, June 11th,\r\n1704.\r\n\r\n\r\nLAWRENCE, NICHOLAS.\r\n\r\nTried for piracy with the rest of Quelch's crew at Boston in 1704.\r\n\r\n\r\nLAWRENCE, RICHARD.\r\n\r\nOne of Captain John Quelch's crew. Tried for piracy at Boston in 1704.\r\n\r\n\r\nLAWSON, EDWARD.\r\n\r\nBorn in the Isle of Man.\r\n\r\nOne of Captain Harris's crew. Hanged at Newport, Rhode Island, in July,\r\n1723, at the age of 20.\r\n\r\n\r\nL'ESCAYER. A French filibuster.\r\n\r\nIn 1685, in company with Grogniet, Davis, and Swan, sacked Paita and\r\nGuayaquil and blockaded Panama. Afterwards sailed with Townley and his\r\nEnglish pirates and again plundered Guayaquil. Suffered a severe defeat at\r\nthe hands of the Spaniards at Quibo, afterwards being rescued by Townley,\r\nwith whom he and his crew of buccaneers sacked Granada in Nicaragua.\r\n\r\n\r\nLESSONE, CAPTAIN. French filibuster.\r\n\r\nIn 1680 he joined Sharp, Coxon, and other English buccaneers in an attack\r\non Porto Bello. Putting 300 men into canoes, they landed some sixty miles\r\nfrom the city and marched for four days, arriving in a weak state through\r\nhardship and lack of food, but in spite of this they took the city on\r\nFebruary 17th, 1680.\r\n\r\n\r\nLEVERCOTT, SAM.\r\n\r\nHanged in 1722 at the Island of St. Kitts, with the rest of Captain\r\nLowther's crew.\r\n\r\n\r\nLEVIT, JOHN.\r\n\r\nOf North Carolina.\r\n\r\nOne of Major Stede Bonnet's crew. Hanged at White Point, Charleston, South\r\nCarolina, on November 8th, 1723.\r\n\r\n\r\nLEWIS, JAMES.\r\n\r\nAfter being a prisoner in France, he managed to reach Spain, and was with\r\nAvery when he seized the ship _Charles the Second_. Tried for piracy at\r\nthe Old Bailey in 1696 and hanged.\r\n\r\n\r\nLEWIS, NICHOLAS.\r\n\r\nOne of Captain George Lowther's crew. Hanged at St. Kitts on March 11th,\r\n1722.\r\n\r\n\r\nLEWIS, WILLIAM.\r\n\r\nThe greatest triumph and most important exploit of this pirate was the\r\nattacking, and eventually taking, of a powerful French ship of twenty-four\r\nguns.\r\n\r\nLewis enjoyed a longer career than most of the brethren, and by 1717 he\r\nwas already one of the leading piratical lights of Nassau, and his end did\r\nnot come till ten years later. In 1726, he spent several months on the\r\ncoast of South Carolina and Virginia, trading with the inhabitants the\r\nspoils he had taken from vessels in the Atlantic. He learnt his trade\r\nunder the daring pirate Bannister, who was brought into Port Royal,\r\nhanging dead from his own yard-arm. On this occasion, Lewis and another\r\nboy were triced up to the corvette's mizzen-peak like \"two living flags.\"\r\n\r\nLewis, amongst other accomplishments, was a born linguist, and could speak\r\nwith fluency in several languages, even the dialect of the Mosquito\r\nIndians. He was once captured by the Spaniards, and taken to Havana, but\r\nescaped with a few other prisoners in a canoe, seized a piragua, and with\r\nthis captured a sloop employed in the turtle trade, and by gradually\r\ntaking larger and larger prizes, Lewis soon found himself master of a fine\r\nship and a crew of more than fifty men. He renamed her the _Morning Star_,\r\nand made her his flagship.\r\n\r\nOn one occasion when chasing a vessel off the Carolina coast, his fore and\r\nmain topmasts were carried away. Lewis, in a frenzy of excitement,\r\nclambered up the main top, tore out a handful of his hair, which he tossed\r\ninto the wind, crying: \"Good devil, take this till I come.\" The ship, in\r\nspite of her damaged rigging, gained on the other ship, which they took.\r\nLewis's sailors, superstitious at the best of times, considered this\r\nintimacy of their captain with Satan a little too much, and soon\r\nafterwards one of the Frenchmen aboard murdered Lewis in his sleep.\r\n\r\n\r\nLEYTON, FRANCIS.\r\n\r\nOne of Captain Charles Harris's crew. Hanged for piracy at Newport, Rhode\r\nIsland, on July 19th, 1723. Age 39.\r\n\r\n\r\nLIMA, MANUEL.\r\n\r\nTaken by H.M. sloop _Tyne_, and hanged at Kingston, Jamaica, in February,\r\n1823.\r\n\r\n\r\nLINCH, CAPTAIN. Buccaneer.\r\n\r\nOf Port Royal, Jamaica.\r\n\r\nIn 1680 Lionel Wafer, tiring of the life of a civil surgeon at Port Royal,\r\nleft Jamaica to go on a voyage with Captains Linch and Cook to the Spanish\r\nMain.\r\n\r\n\r\nLING, CAPTAIN WILLIAM.\r\n\r\nA notorious pirate of New Providence. Captured and hanged shortly after\r\naccepting King George's pardon of 1718.\r\n\r\n\r\nLINISLER, THOMAS.\r\n\r\nOf Lancashire.\r\n\r\nOne of Captain Charles Harris's crew. Hanged at Rhode Island in 1723 at\r\nthe age of 21.\r\n\r\n\r\nLITHGOW, CAPTAIN.\r\n\r\nFamous in his day for his activities in the West Indies, this pirate had\r\nhis headquarters at New Providence in the Bahamas.\r\n\r\n\r\nLIVER, WILLIAM, _alias_ EVIS.\r\n\r\nOne of Major Stede Bonnet's crew. Hanged for piracy at Charleston, South\r\nCarolina, in 1718.\r\n\r\n\r\nLO, MRS. HON-CHO.\r\n\r\nThis Chinese woman pirate was the widow of another noted pirate who was\r\nkilled in 1921. She took command after the death of her husband, and soon\r\nbecame a terror to the countryside about Pakhoi, carrying on the work in\r\nthe best traditions of the craft, being the Admiral of some sixty\r\nocean-going junks. Although both young and pretty, she won a reputation\r\nfor being a thorough-going murderess and pirate.\r\n\r\nDuring the late revolution, Mrs. Lo joined General Wong Min-Tong's forces,\r\nand received the rank of full Colonel. After the war, she resumed her\r\npiracies, occasionally for the sake of variety, surprising and sacking a\r\nvillage or two, and from these she usually carried away some fifty or\r\nsixty girls to sell as slaves.\r\n\r\nHer career ended quite suddenly in October, 1922.\r\n\r\n\r\nLODGE, THOMAS. Poet, buccaneer, and physician.\r\n\r\nBorn about 1557, he was the son of Sir Thomas Lodge, grocer, and Lord\r\nMayor of London in 1563. He was educated at Merchant Taylors' School and\r\nTrinity College, Oxford. The poet engaged in more than one freebooting\r\nexpedition to Spanish waters between 1584 and 1590, and he tells us that\r\nhe accompanied Captain Clarke in an attack on the Azores and the Canaries.\r\n\"Having,\" he tells his friend Lord Hunsdon, \"with Captain Clarke made a\r\nvoyage to the Islands of Terceras and the Canaries, to beguile the time\r\nwith labour, I writ this book, rough, as hatched in the storms of the\r\nocean, and feathered in the surges of many perilous seas.\" On August 26th,\r\n1591, Lodge sailed from Plymouth with Sir Thomas Cavendish in the\r\n_Desire_, a galleon of 140 tons. The freebooters sailed to Brazil and\r\nattacked the town of Santa, while the people were at Mass. They remained\r\nthere from December 15th until January 22nd, 1592. Some of the Englishmen,\r\nof whom Lodge was one, took up their quarters in the College of the\r\nJesuits, and this literary buccaneer spent his time amongst the books in\r\nthe library of the Fathers.\r\n\r\nLeaving Brazil, the small fleet sailed south to the Straits of Magellan.\r\nWhile storm-bound amongst the icy cliffs of Patagonia, Lodge wrote his\r\nArcadian romance \"Margarite of America.\"\r\n\r\nFrom the point of view of plunder, this expedition was a dismal failure,\r\nand the _Desire_ returned and reached the coast of Ireland on June 11th,\r\n1593. The crew had been reduced to sixteen, and of these only five were\r\neven in tolerable health.\r\n\r\nAt the age of 40, Lodge deserted literature and studied medicine, taking\r\nhis degree of Doctor of Physics at Avignon in 1600. His last original work\r\nwas a \"Treatise on the Plague,\" published in 1603. After practising\r\nmedicine with great success for many years, Thomas Lodge died, it is said,\r\nof the plague, in the year 1625, at the age of 68.\r\n\r\n\r\nLONG, ZACHARIAH.\r\n\r\nOf the Province of Holland.\r\n\r\nOne of Major Stede Bonnet's crew. Hanged at White Point, Charleston, in\r\n1718, and buried in the marsh below low-water mark.\r\n\r\n\r\nLOPEZ, JOHN.\r\n\r\nOf Oporto.\r\n\r\nThis Portuguese pirate sailed in the _Royal James_, and was hanged with\r\nthe rest of the crew at Charleston, South Carolina, on November 8th,\r\n1718.\r\n\r\n\r\nLORD, JOHN.\r\n\r\nA soldier. Deserted from Fort Loyal, Falmouth, Maine. Killed at Tarpaulin\r\nCove in 1689.\r\n\r\n\r\nLOW, CAPTAIN EDWARD, or LOE.\r\n\r\nBorn in Westminster, he began in very early life to plunder the boys of\r\ntheir farthings, and as he grew bigger used to gamble with the footmen who\r\nwaited in the lobby of the House of Commons. While still quite small one\r\nof his elder brothers used to carry little Edward hidden in a basket on\r\nhis back, and when in a crowd the future pirate would, from above, snatch\r\nthe hats and even the wigs off the heads of passing citizens and secret\r\nthem in the basket and so get away with them. The Low family were the\r\noriginators of this ingenious and fascinating trick, and for a time it was\r\nmost successful, until the people of the city took to tying on their hats\r\nand wigs with bands to prevent their sudden removal. When he grew up, Ned\r\nwent to Boston and earned an honest living as a rigger, but after a while\r\nhe tired of this and sailed in a sloop to Honduras to steal log-wood. Here\r\nLow quarrelled with his captain, tried to shoot him, and then went off in\r\nan open boat with twelve other men, and the very next day they took a\r\nsmall vessel, in which they began their \"war against all the world.\" Low\r\nsoon happened to meet with Captain Lowther, the pirate, and the two agreed\r\nto sail in company. This partnership lasted until May 28th, 1722, when\r\nthey took a prize, a brigantine from Boston, which Low went into with a\r\ncrew of forty-four men. This vessel they armed with two guns, four\r\nswivels, and six quarter-casks of powder, and saying good-bye to Lowther,\r\nsailed off on their own account. A week later a prize fell into their\r\nhands, which was the first of several. Things soon became too hot for Low\r\nalong the American coast and the West Indies, as several men-of-war were\r\nsearching for him; so he sailed to the Azores, taking on his way a big\r\nFrench ship of thirty-four guns, and later, in the harbour of St. Michael,\r\nhe seized several vessels which he found at anchor there. Here they burnt\r\nthe French ship, but let the crew all go, except the cook, who, they said,\r\n\"being a greasy fellow would fry well in the fire, so the poor man was\r\nbound to the main mast and burnt in the ship to the no small derision of\r\nLow and his Mirmidons.\"\r\n\r\nLow and his crew now began to treat their prisoners with great brutality.\r\nHowever, on one occasion the biter was bitten. It happened that one of the\r\ndrunken crew, playfully cutting at a prisoner, missed his mark and\r\naccidentally slashed Captain Low across his lower jaw, the sword opening\r\nhis cheek and laying bare his teeth. The surgeon was called, who at once\r\nstitched up the wound, but Low found some fault with the operation, as\r\nwell he might, seeing that \"the surgeon was tollerably drunk\" at the time.\r\nThe surgeon's professional pride was outraged by this criticism of his\r\nskill by a layman, and he showed his annoyance in a ready, if\r\nunprofessional, manner, by striking \"Low such a blow with his Fists, that\r\nbroke out all the Stitches, and then bid him sew up his Chops himself and\r\nbe damned, so that the captain made a very pitiful Figure for some time\r\nafter.\" Low took a large number of prizes, but he was not a sympathetic\r\nfigure, and the list of his prizes and brutalities soon becomes irksome\r\nreading. Low, still in the _Fancy_, and accompanied by Captain Harris in\r\nthe _Ranger_, then sailed back to the West Indies, and later to South\r\nCarolina, where he took several prizes, one the _Amsterdam Merchant_\r\n(Captain Willard), belonging to New England, and as Low never missed an\r\nopportunity of showing his dislike of all New Englanders, he sent the\r\ncaptain away with both his ears cut off and with various other wounds\r\nabout his body.\r\n\r\nLow and Harris now made a most unfortunate mistake in giving chase to a\r\nship which on close quarters proved to be not a merchant vessel, but\r\nH.M.S. _Greyhound_. After a short fight, the coward Low slipped away, and\r\nleft his consort, Harris, to carry on an unequal contest until he was\r\ncompelled to surrender his ship.\r\n\r\nLow's cruelties became more and more disgusting, and there can be little\r\ndoubt that he was really by this time a lunatic.\r\n\r\nIn July, 1723, Low took a new ship for himself, naming himself Admiral,\r\nand sporting a new black flag with a red skeleton upon it. He again\r\ncruised off the Azores, the Canaries, and the Guinea coast, but what the\r\nend was of this repulsive, uninteresting, and bloody pirate has never been\r\nknown.\r\n\r\n\r\nLOWTHER, CAPTAIN GEORGE.\r\n\r\nSailed as second mate from the Thames in the _Gambia Castle_, a ship\r\nbelonging to the African Company, sixteen guns and a crew of thirty men.\r\nOn board as passengers were Captain Massey and a number of soldiers.\r\nArriving at their destination, Massey quarrelled with the merchants on\r\nshore, and, a few days later, with Lowther, seized the ship, which he\r\nrenamed the _Delivery_. They now went a-pirating, their first prize being\r\na Boston ship, and cruising about off the Island of Hispaniola, several\r\nmore were taken, but nothing very rich. Lowther quarrelled with Captain\r\nMassey, who, being a soldier, wished to land on some island to plunder the\r\nFrench settlements, but this was not agreed to, and Massey and his\r\nfollowers were sent away in a sloop. Life for Lowther now became a series\r\nof successes, prizes being taken, and visits to land being occasionally\r\nmade for the crew to enjoy a drunken revel.\r\n\r\nHaving met with Captain Low, for a while the two sailed together, and\r\ntook the _Greyhound_, a merchantman, and several more rich prizes. Lowther\r\nnow commanded a small pirate fleet, and styled himself Admiral, his\r\nflagship being the _Happy Delivery_. While careening their ships in the\r\nGulf of Matigue, they were suddenly attacked by the natives, and the\r\npirates barely escaped in a sloop with their lives. Lowther soon improved\r\nhimself by seizing a brigantine, and in her shaped his course to the coast\r\nof South Carolina, a favourite resort for the pirates. Here he attacked an\r\nEnglish ship, but was so roughly handled that he was glad to run his ship\r\nashore and escape.\r\n\r\nIn 1723 he steered for Newfoundland, taking many small vessels there, and\r\nreturning to the West Indies. While cleaning his ship at the Isle of\r\nBlanco, he was suddenly attacked by a South Sea Company's ship, the\r\n_Eagle_, and the pirates were compelled to surrender. Lowther and a dozen\r\nof his crew escaped by climbing out of the cabin window, and, reaching the\r\nisland, hid themselves in the woods. All were caught except Lowther and\r\nthree men and a boy. He was shortly afterwards found lying dead with a\r\npistol by his side, and was supposed to have shot himself. Three of his\r\ncrew who were caught were carried to St. Christopher's, and there tried\r\nfor piracy and hanged.\r\n\r\n\r\nLUDBURY, CAPTAIN. Buccaneer.\r\n\r\nSailed in company with Captains Prince and Harrison in October, 1670,\r\nascended the San Juan River in Nicaragua with a party of 170 men, and\r\nsurprised and plundered the city of Granada.\r\n\r\n\r\nLUKE, CAPTAIN MATTHEW.\r\n\r\nThis Italian pirate had his headquarters at Porto Rico, and specialized in\r\nattacking English ships. In 1718 he took four of these and murdered all\r\nthe crews. In May, 1722, Luke made a terrible mistake. Perceiving what he\r\nthought to be a merchant ship, he attacked her, to find out all too late\r\nthat she was an English man-of-war, the _Lauceston_. Luke and his crew\r\nwere taken to Jamaica and hanged. One of his crew confessed to having\r\nkilled twenty English sailors with his own hands.\r\n\r\n\r\nLUSHINGHAM, CAPTAIN.\r\n\r\nIn 1564 this pirate was at Berehaven in the South of Ireland, having just\r\nsold a cargo of wine out of a Spanish prize to the Lord O'Sullivan, when\r\nsome of Queen Elizabeth's ships arrived in the bay in search of pirates.\r\nBy Lord O'Sullivan's help the pirates escaped, but Lushingham was killed\r\n\"by a piece of ordnance\" as he was in the act of waving his cap towards\r\nthe Queen's ships.\r\n\r\n\r\nLUSSAN, LE SIEUR RAVENEAU DE.\r\n\r\nThis French filibuster was a man of much better birth and education than\r\nthe usual buccaneer. Also, he was the author of a most entertaining book\r\nrecording his adventures and exploits as a buccaneer, called \"Journal du\r\nVoyage fait a la Mer de sud avec les Flibustiers de l'Amerique en 1684.\"\r\n\r\nPressure from his creditors drove de Lussan into buccaneering, as being a\r\nrapid method of gaining enough money to satisfy them and to enable him to\r\nreturn to the fashionable life he loved so well in Paris. De Lussan was,\r\naccording to his own account, a man of the highest principles, and very\r\nreligious. He never allowed his crew to molest priests, nuns, or churches.\r\nAfter taking a Spanish town, the fighting being over, he would lead his\r\ncrew of pirates to attend Mass in the church, and when this was done--and\r\nnot until then--would he allow the plundering and looting to begin.\r\n\r\nDe Lussan was surprised and grieved to find that his Spanish prisoners had\r\na most exaggerated idea of the brutality of the buccaneers, and on one\r\noccasion when he was conducting a fair young Spanish lady, a prisoner, to\r\na place of safety, he was overwhelmed when he discovered that the reason\r\nof her terror was that she believed she was shortly to be eaten by him and\r\nhis crew. To remedy this erroneous impression, it was the custom of the\r\nFrench commander to gather together all his prisoners into the church or\r\nthe plaza, and there to give them a lecture on the true life and character\r\nof the buccaneers.\r\n\r\nThe student who wishes to learn more about the adventures of de Lussan can\r\ndo so in his book. There he will read, amongst other interesting events,\r\nparticulars about the filibuster's surprising and romantic affair with the\r\nbeautiful and wealthy Spanish widow who fell so violently in love with\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nIt happened on one occasion that Raveneau and his crew, having taken a\r\ntown on the West Coast of South America after a somewhat bloody battle,\r\nhad, as usual, attended Mass in the Cathedral, before setting out to\r\nplunder the place.\r\n\r\nEntering one of the chief houses in the town, de Lussan discovered the\r\nwidow of the late town treasurer dissolved in tears, upon which the tender\r\nbuccaneer hastened, with profound apologies, discreetly to withdraw, but\r\ncalling again next day to offer his sympathy he found the widow had\r\nforgotten all about the late treasurer, for she had fallen violently in\r\nlove with her gallant, handsome, and fashionably dressed visitor.\r\n\r\nAfter various adventures, de Lussan arrived safely back in Paris with\r\nample means in his possession not only to satisfy his creditors, but also\r\nto enable him to live there as a gentleman of fortune and fashion.\r\n\r\n\r\nMACHAULY, DANIEL, or MACCAWLY, or MCCAWLEY.\r\n\r\nA Scotch pirate. One of Captain Gow's crew. Hanged at Execution Dock at\r\nWapping on June 11th, 1725.\r\n\r\n\r\nMACKDONALD, EDWARD.\r\n\r\nOne of Captain George Lowther's crew in the _Happy Delivery_. Hanged at\r\nSt. Kitts on March 11th, 1722.\r\n\r\n\r\nMACKET, CAPTAIN, or MAGGOTT.\r\n\r\nOn March 23rd, 1679, Macket, who commanded a small vessel of fourteen\r\ntons, with a crew of twenty men, was at Boca del Toro with Coxon, Hawkins,\r\nand other famous buccaneers, having just returned from the sacking of\r\nPorto Bello.\r\n\r\nShortly afterwards the fleet sailed to Golden Island, off the coast of\r\nDarien, and from thence set out to attack Santa Maria and Panama.\r\n\r\n\r\nMACKINTOSH, WILLIAM.\r\n\r\nOf Canterbury in Kent.\r\n\r\nOne of Captain Roberts's crew. Hanged at Cape Coast Castle in 1722 at the\r\nage of 21.\r\n\r\n\r\nMAGNES, WILLIAM, or MAGNUS.\r\n\r\nBorn at Minehead in Somersetshire in 1687. Quartermaster of the _Royal\r\nFortune_ (Captain Bartholomew Roberts). Tried for piracy at Cape Coast\r\nCastle, and hanged in chains in 1718, for taking and plundering the _King\r\nSolomon_.\r\n\r\n\r\nMAIN, WILLIAM.\r\n\r\nOne of Captain Roberts's crew. Hanged in April, 1722, at the age of 28\r\nyears.\r\n\r\n\r\nMAIN, WILLIAM.\r\n\r\nBoatswain to Captain Bartholomew Roberts in the _Royal Fortune_. Was blown\r\nup, the explosion being caused by one of the crew firing his pistol into\r\nsome gunpowder when the ship was taken by H.M.S. _Swallow_ in 1722.\r\n\r\n\r\nMAINTENON, MARQUIS DE.\r\n\r\nArrived in the West Indies from France in 1676. In 1678 commanded _La\r\nSorcière_, a frigate, and, in company with other French filibusters from\r\nTortuga Island, cruised off the coast of Caracas. He ravaged the islands\r\nof Margarita and Trinidad. He met with but little success, and soon\r\nafterwards his fleet scattered.\r\n\r\n\r\nMAINWARING, CAPTAIN HENRY.\r\n\r\nA notorious Newfoundland pirate.\r\n\r\nOn June 4th, 1614, when off the coast of that island, in command of eight\r\nvessels, he plundered the fishing fleet, stealing what provisions and\r\nstores he was in need of, also taking away with him all the carpenters and\r\nmariners he wanted for his own fleet.\r\n\r\nIt was his custom, when taking seamen, to pick one out of every six. In\r\nall he took 400 men, some of whom joined him willingly, while others were\r\n\"perforstmen.\" Sailing across the Atlantic to the coast of Spain,\r\nMainwaring took a Portuguese ship and stole from out of her a good store\r\nof wine, and out of a French prize 10,000 dried fish. A few years later\r\nthis pirate was pardoned and placed in command of a squadron and sent to\r\nthe Barbary coast in an unsuccessful attempt to drive out the pirates who\r\nwere settled there. Here he may well have met with his old friend Captain\r\nPeter Easton, who had also been a Newfoundland pirate, but in 1613 had\r\njoined the Barbary corsairs.\r\n\r\n\r\nEL MAJORCAM, CAPTAIN ANTONIO.\r\n\r\nAt one time an officer in the Spanish Navy. Became a notorious West Indian\r\npirate, but about 1824 he retired from the sea to become a highwayman on\r\nshore.\r\n\r\n\r\nMANSFIELD, JO.\r\n\r\nOne of Captain Bartholomew Roberts's men. Must not be confused with Edward\r\nMansfield, the famous buccaneer.\r\n\r\nA native of the Orkney Islands. At one time was a highwayman. Later on\r\ndeserted from the _Rose_, man-of-war. Volunteered to join the pirates at\r\nthe island of Dominica, and was always keen to do any mischief. He was a\r\nbully and a drunkard.\r\n\r\nWhen Roberts's ship was attacked by H.M.S. _Swallow_ and had surrendered\r\nafter a sharp fight, Mansfield, who had been below all the while, very\r\ndrunk, came staggering and swearing up on deck, with a drawn cutlass in\r\nhis hand, crying out to know who would go on board the prize with him, and\r\nit was some time before his friends could persuade him of the true\r\ncondition of things.\r\n\r\nAt his trial at Cape Coast Castle he said little in his defence, but\r\npleaded that the cause of his backsliding was drunkenness. Hanged in the\r\nyear 1722 at the age of 30.\r\n\r\n\r\nMANSFIELD, CAPTAIN EDWARD, or MANSVELT.\r\n\r\nA Dutchman born in the Island of Curacao.\r\n\r\nHe was the chief of the buccaneers, and at his death was succeeded by\r\nHenry Morgan. He was the first buccaneer to cross the Isthmus of Darien to\r\nthe Pacific Ocean. Noted for his charm of manner, he was very popular with\r\nthe buccaneers of all nationalities. In 1663 he commanded a brigantine\r\ncarrying four guns and a crew of sixty men. Was chosen admiral of the\r\nfleet of buccaneers that gathered at Bleufields Bay in Jamaica in\r\nNovember, 1665, at the invitation of Modyford, the Governor, when he\r\nappointed young Henry Morgan to be his vice-admiral. This fleet was to\r\nsail and attempt to seize the Island of Curacao, and consisted of fifteen\r\nships and a mixed crew of 500 buccaneers. On the way there they landed in\r\nCuba, although England was at peace with Spain, and marched forty miles\r\ninland, to surprise and sack the town of Sancti Spiritus, from which they\r\ntook a rich booty.\r\n\r\nMansfield, \"being resolved never to face the Governor of Jamaica until he\r\nhad done some service to the King,\" next made a very daring attack on the\r\nIsland of Old Providence, which the Spaniards had fortified and used as a\r\npenal settlement. This was successful, and Mansfield, with great humanity,\r\nlanded all the prisoners on the mainland of America. For a long while it\r\nhad been Mansfield's dream to make this island a permanent home of the\r\nbuccaneers, as it was close to the Spanish Main, with the towns of Porto\r\nBello and Vera Cruz, and on the trade route of the Spanish galleons,\r\ntaking their rich cargoes to Spain.\r\n\r\nMansfield's next exploit was to ascend the San Juan River and to sack\r\nGranada, the capital of Nicaragua. From there he coasted south along Costa\r\nRica, burning plantations, smashing the images in the churches,\r\nham-stringing cows and mules, and cutting down fruit-trees.\r\n\r\nHe returned in June, 1665, to Port Royal, with a rich booty. For this\r\ninexcusable attack on a country at peace with England, Governor Modyford\r\nmildly reproved him!\r\n\r\nMansfield, now an old man, died suddenly at the Island of Tortuga, off\r\nHispaniola, when on a visit to the French pirates there. Another account\r\nsays that he was captured by the Spaniards and taken by them to Porto\r\nBello, and there put to death.\r\n\r\n\r\nMARTEEN, CAPTAIN DAVID. Buccaneer.\r\n\r\nIn 1665 he had his headquarters in Jamaica.\r\n\r\n\r\nMARTEL, CAPTAIN JOHN.\r\n\r\nAn old Jamaican privateer. After the Peace of Utrecht, being out of\r\nemployment, he took to piracy. His career as a pirate was very successful\r\nso long as it lasted. Cruising off Jamaica, Cuba, and other islands, he\r\ncontinued taking ship after ship, with one particularly rich prize, a West\r\nAfrican ship containing gold-dust, elephants' teeth, and slaves. His\r\noriginal command was a sloop of eight guns and a crew of eighty men, but\r\nafter a short while he commanded a small fleet consisting of two ships\r\n(each armed with twenty guns), three sloops, and several armed prizes.\r\nWith these Martel entered a bay in a small island called Santa Cruz, near\r\nPorto Rico, to careen and refit. This was in December, 1716, but news had\r\nleaked out of the pirate's whereabouts, and soon there arrived on the\r\nscene Captain Hume, of H.M.S. _Scarborough_. Martel tried to escape, but\r\nhis ship ran aground, and many of the pirates were killed, but a few, with\r\nMartel, got ashore and hid on the island. None of them were heard of again\r\nexcept Martel, and it was supposed that they had died of hunger. In the\r\nspace of three months Martel took and plundered thirteen vessels, all of\r\nconsiderable size. Two years later he was back in New Providence Island,\r\nwhen Governor Rogers arrived with King George's offer of pardon to the\r\npirates, and Martel was one of those who surrendered.\r\n\r\n\r\nMARTIN, JOHN.\r\n\r\nHanged in Virginia in 1718 with the rest of Blackbeard's crew.\r\n\r\n\r\nMASSEY, CAPTAIN JOHN.\r\n\r\nAs a lieutenant, he \"served with great applause\" in the army in Flanders,\r\nunder the command of the Duke of Marlborough.\r\n\r\nHe afterwards sailed from the Thames in the _Gambia Castle_, a ship of the\r\nAfrican Company, in command of a company of soldiers which was being sent\r\nto garrison the fort. The merchants of Gambia were supposed to victual\r\nthis garrison, but the rations supplied were considered by Massey to be\r\nquite insufficient. He quarrelled with the Governor and merchants, and\r\ntook his soldiers back on board the ship, and with Lowther, the second\r\nmate, seized the ship and turned pirate. Lowther and Massey eventually\r\nquarrelled, for the latter, being a soldier, \"was solicitous to move in\r\nhis own sphere\"--that is, he wanted to land his troops and plunder the\r\nFrench West Indian settlements. In the end Massey and a few followers were\r\npermitted to go off in a captured sloop, and in this sailed for Port\r\nRoyal, Jamaica. Arrived there, \"with a bold countenance he went to the\r\nGovernor\" and told a long and plausible tale of how he had managed to\r\nescape from the pirates at the first opportunity. He deceived the\r\nsympathetic Governor, and was sent with Captain Laws to hunt for Lowther.\r\nReturning to Jamaica without finding Lowther, he was granted a\r\n\"certificate of his surrender,\" and came to England as a passenger.\r\n\r\nOn reaching London, he wrote a narrative of the whole affair--or as much\r\nas he deemed wise--to the African Company, who, receiving the story with\r\nfar less credulity than the Governor of Jamaica, returned him answer \"that\r\nhe should be fairly hanged,\" and very shortly afterwards he was, at\r\nTyburn on July 26th, 1723.\r\n\r\n\r\nMAY, WILLIAM.\r\n\r\nA London mariner. One of Captain Avery's crew, left behind in Madagascar\r\nvery sick. A negro, hearing that an Englishman was there, came to him and\r\nnursed and fed him. This negro spoke good English, having lived at Bethnal\r\nGreen.\r\n\r\nMay was promoted afterwards to be captain of a ship in the Red Sea. He was\r\ndescribed by a shipmate as being \"a true cock of the Game and an old\r\nsportsman.\" Hanged at London in 1696.\r\n\r\n\r\nMAZE, CAPTAIN WILLIAM, or MACE, or MAISE.\r\n\r\nA notorious pirate; particularly mentioned in the royal warrant\r\nauthorizing Captain Kidd to go and capture certain \"wicked and\r\nill-disposed persons.\"\r\n\r\nArrived in command of a big ship at New York in 1699, loaded with booty\r\ntaken in the Red Sea.\r\n\r\n\r\nMcCARTHY, CAPTAIN DENNIS.\r\n\r\nOf New Providence, Bahama Islands.\r\n\r\nThis pirate and prize-fighter was one of those who refused King George's\r\npardon in 1717, and was eventually hanged by his late fellow-pirates. On\r\nthe gallows he made the following dying speech:\r\n\r\n\"Some friends of mine have often said I should die in my shoes, but I\r\nwould rather make them liars.\" And so, kicking off his shoes, he was\r\nhanged.\r\n\r\n\r\nMEGHLYN, HANS VAN.\r\n\r\nA pirate of Antwerp, who owned a vessel of forty-five tons, painted black\r\nwith pitch, and carried a crew of thirty. In 1539 he was cruising off\r\nWhitstable, on the lookout for vessels entering or leaving the Thames.\r\nCromwell had been warned by Vaughan to look out for this pirate ship.\r\n\r\n\r\nDE MELTON.\r\n\r\nA well-known pirate in the sixteenth century. Was with Kellwanton when he\r\nwas captured in the Isle of Man in 1531, but de Melton managed to escape\r\nwith some of the crew and get away in their ship to Grimsby.\r\n\r\n\r\nMELVIN, WILLIAM.\r\n\r\nThis Scotch pirate was hanged, with other members of Gow's crew, at\r\nWapping in June, 1725.\r\n\r\n\r\nMENDOZA, ANTONIO.\r\n\r\nA Spaniard from San Domingo.\r\n\r\nMention is made of this unlucky mariner in a very interesting document\r\nwhich Mr. A. Hyatt Verrill was fortunate enough to acquire quite recently\r\nin the island of St. Kitts.

Hanged at Boston on June 30th, 1704. A\r\nbroadsheet published at the time, describing the scenes at the execution,\r\ntells us that Miller \"seemed much concerned, and complained of a great\r\nBurden of Sins to answer for, expressing often: 'Lord, what shall I do to\r\nbe Saved?'\"\r\n\r\n\r\nMILLER, THOMAS.\r\n\r\nQuartermaster on the pirate ship _Queen Ann's Revenge_, and killed on\r\nNovember 22nd, 1718.\r\n\r\n\r\nMISNIL, SIEUR DU.\r\n\r\nA French filibuster who commanded a ship, _La Trompeuse_ (one hundred men\r\nand fourteen guns).\r\n\r\n\r\nMISSON, CAPTAIN.\r\n\r\nThis unique pirate came of an ancient French family of Provence. He was\r\nthe youngest of a large family, and received a good education. At the age\r\nof 15 he had already shown unusual distinction in the subjects of humanity\r\nand logic, and had passed quite tolerably in mathematics. Deciding to\r\ncarve a fortune for himself with his sword, he was sent to the Academy at\r\nAngiers for a year, and at the conclusion of his military studies his\r\nfather would have bought him a commission in a regiment of musketeers. But\r\nyoung Misson had been reading books of travel, and begged so earnestly to\r\nbe allowed to go to sea that his father got him admitted as a volunteer on\r\nthe French man-of-war _Victoire_, commanded by Monsieur Fourbin. Joining\r\nhis ship at Marseilles, they cruised in the Mediterranean, and the young\r\nvolunteer soon showed great keenness in his duties, and lost no\r\nopportunity of learning all he could about navigation and the\r\nconstruction of ships, even parting with his pocket-money to the boatswain\r\nand the carpenter to receive special instruction from them.\r\n\r\nArriving one day at Naples, Misson obtained permission from the captain to\r\nvisit Rome, a visit that eventually changed his whole career.\r\n\r\nIt happened that while in Rome the young sailor met a priest, a Signor\r\nCaraccioli, a Dominican, who held most unclerical views about the\r\npriesthood; and, indeed, his ideas on life in general were, to say the\r\nleast, unorthodox. A great friendship was struck up between these two,\r\nwhich at length led the priest to throw off his habit and join the crew of\r\nthe _Victoire_. Two days out from port they met and fought a desperate\r\nhand-to-hand engagement with a Sallee pirate, in which the ex-priest and\r\nMisson both distinguished themselves by their bravery. Misson's next\r\nvoyage was in a privateer, the _Triumph_, and, meeting one day an English\r\nship, the _Mayflower_, between Guernsey and Start Point, the merchantman\r\nwas defeated after a gallant resistance.\r\n\r\nRejoining the _Victoire_, Misson sailed from Rochelle to the West Indies,\r\nand Caraccioli lost no opportunity of preaching to young Misson the gospel\r\nof atheism and communism, and with such success that the willing convert\r\nsoon held views as extreme as those of his teacher. These two apostles now\r\nbegan to talk to the crew, and their views, particularly on the rights of\r\nprivate property, were soon held by almost all on board. A fortunate event\r\nhappened just then to help the new \"cause.\" Meeting with an English\r\nman-of-war, the _Winchester_, off the island of Martinique, a smart\r\nengagement took place between the two ships, at the very commencement of\r\nwhich Captain Fourbin and three of the officers on the French ship were\r\nkilled. The fight ended by the English ship blowing up, and an era of\r\nspeech-making may be said to have now begun.\r\n\r\nFirstly, Signor Caraccioli, stepping forward, made a long and eloquent\r\naddress to Misson, inviting him to become captain of the _Victoire_, and\r\ncalling upon him to follow the example of Alexander the Great with the\r\nPersians, and that of the Kings Henry IV. and VII. of England, reminding\r\nhim how Mahomet, with but a few camel-drivers, founded the Ottoman Empire,\r\nalso how Darius, with a handful of companions, got possession of Persia.\r\nInflamed by this speech, young Misson showed what he could do, when,\r\ncalling all hands up on deck, he made his first, but, as events proved, by\r\nfar from last, speech. The result was a triumph of oratory, the excited\r\nFrench sailors crying out: \"Vive le Capitaine Misson et son Lieutenant le\r\nScavant Caraccioli!\" Misson, returning thanks in a few graceful words,\r\npromised to do his utmost as their commander for their new marine\r\nrepublic. The newly elected officers retiring to the great cabin, a\r\nfriendly discussion began as to their future arrangements. The first\r\nquestion that arose was to choose what colours they should sail under. The\r\nnewly elected boatswain, Mathew le Tondu, a brave but simple mariner,\r\nadvised a black one, as being the most terrifying. This brought down a\r\nfull blast of eloquence from Caraccioli, the new lieutenant, who objected\r\nthat \"they were no pirates, but men who were resolved to affect the\r\nLiberty which God and Nature gave them,\" with a great deal about\r\n\"guardians of the Peoples Rights and Liberties,\" etc., and, gradually\r\nbecoming worked up, gave the wretched boatswain, who must have regretted\r\nhis unfortunate remark, a heated lecture on the soul, on shaking \"the Yoak\r\nof Tyranny\" off their necks, on \"Oppression and Poverty\" and the miseries\r\nof life under these conditions as compared to those of \"Pomp and\r\nDignity.\" In the end he showed that their policy was not to be one of\r\npiracy, for pirates were men of no principle and led dissolute lives; but\r\n_their_ lives were to be brave, just, and innocent, and their cause the\r\ncause of Liberty; and therefore, instead of a black flag, they should live\r\nunder a white ensign, with the motto \"For God and Liberty\" embroidered\r\nupon it.\r\n\r\nThe simple sailors, debarred from these councils, had gathered outside the\r\ncabin, but were able to overhear this speech, and at its conclusion,\r\ncarried away by enthusiasm, loud cries went up of \"Liberty! Liberty! We\r\nare free men! Vive the brave Captain Misson and the noble Lieutenant\r\nCaraccioli!\" Alas! it is impossible in the space of this work to do\r\njustice to the perfectly wonderful and idealistic conditions of this\r\npirate crew. Their speeches and their kind acts follow each other in\r\nfascinating profusion. We can only recommend those who feel disposed to\r\nfollow more closely the history of these delightful pirates, to read the\r\naccount printed in English in 1726, if they are fortunate enough to come\r\nby a copy.\r\n\r\nThe first prize taken by these pirates under the white flag was an English\r\nsloop commanded by one Captain Thomas Butler, only a day's sail out from\r\nSt. Kitts. After helping themselves to a couple of puncheons of rum and a\r\nfew other articles which the pirates needed, but without doing any\r\nunkindness to the crew, nor stripping them, as was the usual custom of\r\npirates on such occasions, they let them go, greatly to the surprise of\r\nCaptain Butler, who handsomely admitted that he had never before met with\r\nso much \"candour\" in any similar situation, and to further express his\r\ngratitude he ordered his crew to man ship, and at parting called for three\r\nrousing British cheers for the good pirate and his men, which were\r\nenthusiastically given.\r\n\r\nSailing to the coast of Africa, Misson took a Dutch ship, the\r\n_Nieuwstadt_, of Amsterdam. The cargo was found to consist of gold dust\r\nand seventeen slaves. In the latter Captain Misson recognized a good text\r\nfor one of his little sermons to his crew, so, calling all hands on deck,\r\nhe made the following observations on the vile trade of slavery, telling\r\nhis men:\r\n\r\n\"That the Trading for those of our own Species, cou'd never be agreeable\r\nto the Eyes of divine Justice. That no Man had Power of the Liberty of\r\nanother; and while those who profess a more enlightened Knowledge of the\r\nDeity, sold Men like Beasts; they prov'd that their Religion was no more\r\nthan Grimace, and that they differ'd from the Barbarians in Name only,\r\nsince their Practice was in nothing more humane. For his Part, and he\r\nhop'd he spoke the Sentiments of all his brave Companions, he had not\r\nexempted his Neck from the galling Yoak of Slavery, and asserted his own\r\nLiberty, to enslave others. That however, these Men, were distinguished\r\nfrom the Europeans by their Colour, Customs, or religious Rites, they were\r\nthe Work of the same omnipotent Being, and endued with equal Reason.\r\nWherefore, he desired they might be treated like Freemen (for he wou'd\r\nbanish even the Name of Slavery from among them) and be divided into\r\nMesses among them, to the end they might the sooner learn their language,\r\nbe sensible of the Obligations they had to them, and more capable and\r\nzealous to defend that Liberty they owed to their Justice and Humanity.\"\r\nThis speech was met with general applause, and once again the good ship\r\n_Victoire_ rang with cries of \"Vive le Capitaine Misson!\" The negroes were\r\nfreed of their irons, dressed up in the clothes of their late Dutch\r\nmasters, and it is gratifying to read that \"by their Gesticulations, they\r\nshew'd they were gratefully sensible of their being delivered from their\r\nChains.\" But alas! a sad cloud was creeping insidiously over the fair\r\nreputation of these super-pirates. Out of the last slave ship they had\r\ntaken, a number of Dutch sailors had volunteered to serve with Misson and\r\nhad come aboard as members of his crew. Hitherto no swearword was ever\r\nheard, no loose or profane expression had pained the ears of Captain\r\nMisson or his ex-priestly lieutenant. But the Dutch mariners began to lead\r\nthe crew into ways of swearing and drunkenness, which, coming to the\r\ncaptain's notice, he thought best to nip these weeds in the bud; so,\r\ncalling both French and Dutch upon deck, and desiring the Dutch captain to\r\ntranslate his remarks into the Dutch language, he told them that--\r\n\r\n\"Before he had the Misfortune of having them on Board, his Ears were never\r\ngrated with hearing the Name of the great Creator profaned, tho' he, to\r\nhis Sorrow, had often since heard his own Men guilty of that Sin, which\r\nadminister'd neither Profit nor Pleasure, and might draw upon them a\r\nsevere Punishment: That if they had a just Idea of that great Being, they\r\nwou'd never mention him, but they wou'd immediately reflect on his Purity,\r\nand their own Vileness. That we so easily took Impression from our\r\nCompany, that the Spanish Proverb says: 'Let a Hermit and a Thief live\r\ntogether, the Thief wou'd become Hermit, or the Hermit thief': That he saw\r\nthis verified in his ship, for he cou'd attribute the Oaths and Curses he\r\nhad heard among his brave Companions, to nothing but the odious Example of\r\nthe Dutch: That this was not the only Vice they had introduced, for before\r\nthey were on Board, his Men were Men, but he found by their beastly\r\nPattern they were degenerated into Brutes, by drowning that only Faculty,\r\nwhich distinguishes between Man and Beast, Reason. That as he had the\r\nHonour to command them, he could not see them run into these odious Vices\r\nwithout a sincere Concern, as he had a paternal Affection for them, and he\r\nshould reproach himself as neglectful of the common Good, if he did not\r\nadmonish them; and as by the Post which they had honour'd him, he was\r\nobliged to have a watchful Eye over their general Interest; he was obliged\r\nto tell them his Sentiments were, that the Dutch allured them to a\r\ndissolute Way of Life, that they might take some Advantage over them:\r\nWherefore, as his brave Companions, he was assured, wou'd be guided by\r\nreason, he gave the Dutch Notice, that the first whom he catch'd either\r\nwith an Oath in his Mouth or Liquor in his Head, should be brought to the\r\nGeers, whipped and pickled, for an Example to the rest of his Nation: As\r\nto his Friends, his Companions, his Children, those gallant, those\r\ngenerous, noble and heroick Souls he had the Honour to command, he\r\nentreated them to allow a small Time for Reflection, and to consider how\r\nlittle Pleasure, and how much Danger, might flow from imitating the Vices\r\nof their Enemies; and that they would among themselves, make a Law for the\r\nSuppression of what would otherwise estrange them from the Source of Life,\r\nand consequently leave them destitute of his Protection.\"\r\n\r\nThis speech had the desired effect, and ever afterwards, when any one of\r\nthe crew had reason to mention the name of his captain, he never failed to\r\nadd the epithet \"Good\" before it.\r\n\r\nThese chaste pirates soon took and plundered many rich merchant ships, but\r\nalways in the most gentlemanly manner, so that none failed to be \"not a\r\nlittle surprised at the Regularity, Tranquillity and Humanity of these\r\nnew-fashioned Pyrates.\" From out of one of these, an English vessel, they\r\ntook a sum of £60,000, but during the engagement the captain was killed.\r\nPoor Captain Misson was broken-hearted over this unfortunate mishap, and\r\nto show as best he could his regret, he buried the body on shore, and,\r\nfinding that one of his men was by trade a stonecutter, raised a monument\r\nover the grave with, engraved upon it, the words: \"Here lies a gallant\r\nEnglish-Man.\" And at the conclusion of a very moving burial service he\r\npaid a final tribute by \"a triple Discharge of 50 small Arms and fired\r\nMinute Guns.\"\r\n\r\nMisson now sailed to the Island of Johanna in the Indian Ocean, which\r\nbecame his future home. Misson married the sister of the local dusky\r\nqueen, and his lieutenant led to the altar her niece, while many of the\r\ncrew also were joined in holy wedlock to one or more ladies of more humble\r\nsocial standing.\r\n\r\nAlready Misson has received more space than he is entitled to in a work of\r\nreference of this kind, but his career is so full of charming incidents\r\nthat one is tempted to continue to unseemly length. Let it suffice to say\r\nthat for some years Misson made speeches, robbed ships, and now and again,\r\nwhen unavoidably driven to it, would reluctantly slaughter his enemies.\r\n\r\nFinally, Misson took his followers to a sheltered bay in Madagascar, and\r\non landing there made a little speech, telling them that here they could\r\nsettle down, build a town, that here, in fact, \"they might have some Place\r\nto call their own; and a Receptacle, when Age or Wounds had render'd them\r\nincapable of Hardship, where they might enjoy the Fruits of their Labour,\r\nand go to their Graves in Peace.\"\r\n\r\nThis ideal colony was called Libertatia, and was run on strictly\r\nSocialistic lines, for no one owned any individual property; all money was\r\nkept in a common treasury, and no hedges bounded any man's particular plot\r\nof land. Docks were made and fortifications set up. Soon Misson had two\r\nships built, called the _Childhood_ and the _Liberty_, and these were sent\r\nfor a voyage round the island, to map and chart the coast, and to train\r\nthe released slaves to be efficient sailors. A Session House was built,\r\nand a form of Government arranged. At the first meeting Misson was elected\r\nLord Conservator, as they called the President, for a term of three years,\r\nand during that period he was to have \"all the Ensigns of Royalty to\r\nattend him.\" Captain Tew, the English pirate, was elected Admiral of the\r\nFleet of Libertatia, Caraccioli became Secretary of State, while the\r\nCouncil was formed of the ablest amongst the pirates, without distinction\r\nof nation or colour. The difficulty of language, as French, English,\r\nPortuguese, and Dutch were equally spoken, was overcome by the invention\r\nof a new language, a kind of Esperanto, which was built up of words from\r\nall four. For many years this ideally successful and happy pirate Utopia\r\nflourished; but at length misfortunes came, one on top of the other, and a\r\nsudden and unexpected attack by the hitherto friendly natives finally\r\ndrove Misson and a few other survivors to seek safety at sea, but,\r\novertaken by a hurricane, their vessel foundered, and Misson and all his\r\ncrew were drowned; and thus ended the era of what may be called \"piracy\r\nwithout tears.\"\r\n\r\n      He was the mildest-manner'd man\r\n    That ever scuttled ship or cut a throat.\r\n                                            BYRON.\r\n\r\n\r\nMITCHELL, CAPTAIN.\r\n\r\nAn English buccaneer of Jamaica, who flourished in 1663.\r\n\r\n\r\nMITCHELL, JOHN.\r\n\r\nOf Shadwell Parish, London.\r\n\r\nOne of the crew of the _Ranger_. Condemned to death, but reprieved and\r\nsold to the Royal African Company.\r\n\r\n\r\nM'KINLIE, PETER. Irish pirate.\r\n\r\nBoatswain in a merchant ship which sailed from the Canaries to England in\r\nthe year 1765. On board were three passengers, the adventurous Captain\r\nGlass and his wife and daughter. One night M'Kinlie and four other\r\nmutineers murdered the commander of the vessel, Captain Cockeran, and\r\nCaptain Glass and his family, as well as all the crew except two\r\ncabin-boys. After throwing their bodies overboard, M'Kinlie steered for\r\nthe coast of Ireland, and on December 3rd arrived in the neighbourhood of\r\nthe harbour of Ross. Filling the long-boat with dollars, weighing some two\r\ntons, they rowed ashore, after killing the two boys and scuttling the\r\nship. On landing, the pirates found they had much more booty than they\r\ncould carry, so they buried 250 bags of dollars in the sand, and took what\r\nthey could with them to a village called Fishertown. Here they regaled\r\nthemselves, while one of the villagers relieved them of a bag containing\r\n1,200 dollars. Next day they walked into Ross, and there sold another bag\r\nof dollars, and with the proceeds each man bought a pair of pistols and a\r\nhorse and rode to Dublin. In the meanwhile the ship, instead of sinking,\r\nwas washed up on the shore. Strong suspicion being roused in the\r\ncountryside, messengers were sent post-haste to inform the Lords of the\r\nRegency at Dublin that the supposed pirates were in the city. Three of\r\nthem were arrested in the Black Bull Inn in Thomas Street, but M'Kinlie\r\nand another pirate, who had already taken a post-chaise for Cork,\r\nintending to embark there on a vessel for England, were arrested on the\r\nway.\r\n\r\nThe five pirates were tried in Dublin, condemned and executed, their\r\nbodies being hung in chains, on December 19th, 1765.\r\n\r\n\r\nMONTBARS, THE EXTERMINATOR.\r\n\r\nA native of Languedoc. He joined the buccaneers after reading a book which\r\nrecorded the cruelty of the Spaniards to the American natives, and this\r\nstory inspired him with such a hatred of all Spaniards that he determined\r\nto go to the West Indies, throw in his lot with the buccaneers, and to\r\ndevote his whole life and energies to punishing the Spaniards. He carried\r\nout his resolve most thoroughly, and treated all Spaniards who came into\r\nhis power with such cruelty that he became known all up and down the\r\nSpanish Main as the Exterminator. Eventually Montbars became a notorious\r\nand successful buccaneer or pirate chief, having his headquarters at St.\r\nBartholomew, one of the Virgin Islands, to which he used to bring all his\r\nprisoners and spoils taken out of Spanish ships and towns.\r\n\r\n\r\nMONTENEGRO.\r\n\r\nA Columbian. One of Captain Gilbert's crew in the pirate schooner _Panda_.\r\nHanged at Boston in 1835.\r\n\r\n\r\nDE MONT, FRANCIS.\r\n\r\nCaptured in South Carolina in 1717. Tried at Charleston, and convicted of\r\ntaking the _Turtle Dove_ and other vessels in the previous July. Hanged in\r\nJune, 1717.\r\n\r\n\r\nMOODY, CAPTAIN CHRISTOPHER.\r\n\r\nA notorious pirate. Very active off the coast of Carolina, 1717, with two\r\nships under his command. In 1722 was with Roberts on board the _Royal\r\nFortune_, being one of his chief men or \"Lords.\" Taken prisoner, and tried\r\nat Cape Coast Castle, and hanged in chains at the age of 28.\r\n\r\n\r\nMOORE. Gunner.\r\n\r\nA gunner aboard Captain Kidd's ship the _Adventure_. When Kidd's mutinous\r\ncrew were all for attacking a Dutch ship, Kidd refused to allow them to,\r\nand Moore threatened the captain, who seized a bucket and struck Moore on\r\nthe head with it, the blow killing him. Kidd was perfectly justified in\r\nkilling this mutinous sailor, but eventually it was for this act that he\r\nwas hanged in London.\r\n\r\n\r\nMORGAN, CAPTAIN.\r\n\r\nThis pirate must not be confused with the buccaneer, Sir Henry Morgan.\r\nLittle is known about him except that he was with Hamlin, the French\r\npirate, in 1683, off the coast of West Africa, and helped to take several\r\nDanish and English ships. Soon the pirates quarrelled over the division of\r\ntheir plunder and separated into two companies, the English following\r\nCaptain Morgan in one of the prizes.\r\n\r\n\r\nMORGAN, COLONEL BLODRE, or BLEDRY.\r\n\r\nThis buccaneer was probably a relation of Sir Henry Morgan. He was an\r\nimportant person in Jamaica between 1660 and 1670. At the taking of Panama\r\nby Henry Morgan in 1670 the Colonel commanded the rearguard of 300 men. In\r\nMay, 1671, he was appointed to act as Deputy Governor of Providence Island\r\nby Sir James Modyford.\r\n\r\n\r\nMORGAN, LIEUT.-COLONEL EDWARD. Buccaneer.\r\n\r\nUncle and father-in-law of Sir Henry Morgan.\r\n\r\nIn 1665, when war had been declared on Holland, the Governor of Jamaica\r\nissued commissions to several pirates and buccaneers to sail to and attack\r\nthe Dutch islands of St. Eustatius, Saba, and Curacao. Morgan was put in\r\ncommand of ten ships and some 500 men; most of them were \"reformed\r\nprisoners,\" while some were condemned pirates who had been pardoned in\r\norder to let them join the expedition.\r\n\r\nBefore leaving Jamaica the crews mutinied, but were pacified by the\r\npromise of an equal share of all the spoils that should be taken. Three\r\nships out of the fleet slipped away on the voyage, but the rest arrived at\r\nSt. Kitts, landed, and took the fort. Colonel Morgan, who was an old and\r\ncorpulent man, died of the heat and exertion during the campaign.\r\n\r\n\r\nMORGAN, LIEUT.-COLONEL THOMAS.\r\n\r\nSailed with Colonel Edward Morgan to attack St. Eustatius and Saba\r\nIslands, and after these were surrendered by the Dutch, Thomas Morgan was\r\nleft in charge.\r\n\r\nIn 1686 he sailed in command of a company of buccaneers to assist Governor\r\nWells, of St. Kitts, against the French. The defence of the island was\r\ndisgraceful, and Morgan's company was the only one which displayed any\r\ncourage or discipline, and most of them were killed or wounded, Colonel\r\nMorgan himself being shot in both legs.\r\n\r\nOften these buccaneer leaders altered their titles from colonel to\r\ncaptain, to suit the particular enterprise on which they were engaged,\r\naccording if it took place on sea or land.\r\n\r\n\r\nMORGAN, SIR HENRY. Buccaneer.\r\n\r\nThis, the greatest of all the \"brethren of the coast,\" was a Welshman,\r\nborn at Llanrhymmy in Monmouthshire in the year 1635. The son of a\r\nwell-to-do farmer, Robert Morgan, he early took to the seafaring life.\r\nWhen quite a young man Morgan went to Barbadoes, but afterwards he\r\nsettled at Jamaica, which was his home for the rest of his life.\r\n\r\nMorgan may have been induced to go to the West Indies by his uncle,\r\nColonel Morgan, who was for a time Deputy Governor of Jamaica, a post Sir\r\nHenry Morgan afterwards held.\r\n\r\nMorgan was a man of great energy, and must have possessed great power of\r\nwinning his own way with people. That he could be absolutely unscrupulous\r\nwhen it suited his ends there can be little doubt. He was cruel at times,\r\nbut was not the inhuman monster that he is made out to be by Esquemeling\r\nin his \"History of the Bucaniers.\" This was largely proved by the evidence\r\ngiven in the suit for libel brought and won by Morgan against the\r\npublishers, although Morgan was, if possible, more indignant over the\r\nstatement in the same book that he had been kidnapped in Wales and sold,\r\nas a boy, and sent to be a slave in Barbadoes. That he could descend to\r\nrank dishonesty was shown when, returning from his extraordinary and\r\nsuccessful assault on the city of Panama in 1670, to Chagres, he left most\r\nof his faithful followers behind, without ships or food, while he slipped\r\noff in the night with most of the booty to Jamaica. No doubt, young Morgan\r\ncame to Jamaica with good credentials from his uncle, the Colonel, for the\r\nlatter was held in high esteem by Modyford, then Governor of Barbadoes,\r\nwho describes Colonel Morgan as \"that honest privateer.\"\r\n\r\nColonel Morgan did not live to see his nephew reach the pinnacle of his\r\nsuccess, for in the year 1665 he was sent at the head of an expedition to\r\nattack the Dutch stronghold at St. Eustatius Island, but he was too old to\r\nstand the hardships of such an expedition and died shortly afterwards.\r\n\r\nBy this time Morgan had made his name as a successful and resolute\r\nbuccaneer by returning to Port Royal from a raiding expedition in Central\r\nAmerica with a huge booty.\r\n\r\nIn 1665 Morgan, with two other buccaneers, Jackman and Morris, plundered\r\nthe province of Campeachy, and then, acting as Vice-Admiral to the most\r\nfamous buccaneer of the day, Captain Mansfield, plundered Cuba, captured\r\nProvidence Island, sacked Granada, burnt and plundered the coast of Costa\r\nRica, bringing back another booty of almost fabulous wealth to Jamaica. In\r\nthis year Morgan married a daughter of his uncle, Colonel Morgan.\r\n\r\nIn 1668, when 33 years of age, Morgan was commissioned by the Jamaican\r\nGovernment to collect together the privateers, and by 1669 he was in\r\ncommand of a big fleet, when he was almost killed by a great explosion in\r\nthe _Oxford_, which happened while Morgan was giving a banquet to his\r\ncaptains. About this time Morgan calmly took a fine ship, the _Cour\r\nVolant_, from a French pirate, and made her his own flagship, christening\r\nher the _Satisfaction_.\r\n\r\nIn 1670 the greatest event of Morgan's life took place--the sacking of\r\nPanama. First landing a party which took the Castle of San Lorenzo at the\r\nmouth of the Chagres River, Morgan left a strong garrison there to cover\r\nhis retreat and pushed on with 1,400 men in a fleet of canoes up the river\r\non January 9th, 1671. The journey across the isthmus, through the tropical\r\njungle, was very hard on the men, particularly as they had depended on\r\nfinding provisions to supply their wants on the way, and carried no food\r\nwith them. They practically starved until the sixth day, when they found a\r\nbarn full of maize, which the fleeing Spaniards had neglected to destroy.\r\nOn the evening of the ninth day a scout reported he had seen the steeple\r\nof a church in Panama. Morgan, with that touch of genius which so often\r\nbrought him success, attacked the city from a direction the Spaniards had\r\nnot thought possible, so that their guns were all placed where they were\r\nuseless, and they were compelled to do just what the buccaneer leader\r\nwanted them to do--namely, to come out of their fortifications and fight\r\nhim in the open. The battle raged fiercely for two hours between the brave\r\nSpanish defenders and the equally brave but almost exhausted buccaneers.\r\nWhen at last the Spaniards turned and ran, the buccaneers were too tired\r\nto immediately follow up their success, but after resting they advanced,\r\nand at the end of three hours' street fighting the city was theirs. The\r\nfirst thing Morgan now did was to assemble all his men and strictly forbid\r\nthem to drink any wine, telling them that he had secret information that\r\nthe wine had been poisoned by the Spaniards before they left the city.\r\nThis was, of course, a scheme of Morgan's to stop his men from becoming\r\ndrunk, when they would be at the mercy of the enemy, as had happened in\r\nmany a previous buccaneer assault.\r\n\r\nMorgan now set about plundering the city, a large part of which was burnt\r\nto the ground, though whether this was done by his orders or by the\r\nSpanish Governor has never been decided. After three weeks the buccaneers\r\nstarted back on their journey to San Lorenzo, with a troop of 200\r\npack-mules laden with gold, silver, and goods of all sorts, together with\r\na large number of prisoners. The rearguard on the march was under the\r\ncommand of a kinsman of the Admiral, Colonel Bledry Morgan.\r\n\r\nOn their arrival at Chagres the spoils were divided, amidst a great deal\r\nof quarrelling, and in March, 1671, Morgan sailed off to Port Royal with a\r\nfew friends and the greater part of the plunder, leaving his faithful\r\nfollowers behind without ships or provisions, and with but £10 apiece as\r\ntheir share of the spoils.\r\n\r\nOn May 31st, 1671, the Council of Jamaica passed a vote of thanks to\r\nMorgan for his successful expedition, and this in spite of the fact that\r\nin July, a year before, a treaty had been concluded at Madrid between\r\nSpain and England for \"restraining depredations and establishing peace\" in\r\nthe New World.\r\n\r\nIn April, 1672, Morgan was carried to England as a prisoner in the\r\n_Welcome_ frigate. But he was too popular to be convicted, and after being\r\nacquitted was appointed Deputy Governor of Jamaica, and in November, 1674,\r\nhe was knighted and returned to the West Indies. In 1672 Major-General\r\nBanister, who was Commander-in-Chief of the troops in Jamaica, writing to\r\nLord Arlington about Morgan, said: \"He (Morgan) is a well deserving\r\nperson, and one of great courage and conduct, who may, with His Majesty's\r\npleasure, perform good public service at home, or be very advantageous to\r\nthis island if war should again break forth with the Spaniards.\"\r\n\r\nWhile Morgan was in England he brought an action for libel against William\r\nCrooke, the publisher of the \"History of the Bucaniers of America.\" The\r\nresult of this trial was that Crooke paid £200 damages to Morgan and\r\npublished a long and grovelling apology.\r\n\r\nMorgan was essentially a man of action, and a regular life on shore proved\r\nirksome to him, for we learn from a report sent home by Lord Vaughan in\r\n1674 that Morgan \"frequented the taverns of Port Royal, drinking and\r\ngambling in unseemly fashion,\" but nevertheless the Jamaican Assembly had\r\nvoted the Lieutenant-Governor a sum of £600 special salary. In 1676\r\nVaughan brought definite charges against Morgan and another member of the\r\nCouncil, Robert Byndloss, of giving aid to certain Jamaica pirates.\r\n\r\nMorgan made a spirited defence and, no doubt largely owing to his\r\npopularity, got off, and in 1678 was granted a commission to be a captain\r\nof a company of 100 men.\r\n\r\nThe Governor to succeed Vaughan was Lord Carlisle, who seems to have liked\r\nMorgan, in spite of his jovial \"goings on\" with his old buccaneer friends\r\nin the taverns of Port Royal, and in some of his letters speaks of\r\nMorgan's \"generous manner,\" and hints that whatever allowances are made to\r\nhim \"he will be a beggar.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1681 Sir Thomas Lynch was appointed to be Governor, and trouble at once\r\nbegan between him and his deputy. Amongst the charges the former brought\r\nagainst Morgan was one of his having been overheard to say, \"God damn the\r\nAssembly!\" for which he was suspended from that body.\r\n\r\nIn April, 1688, the King, at the urgent request of the Duke of Albemarle,\r\nordered Morgan to be reinstated in the Assembly, but Morgan did not live\r\nlong to enjoy his restored honours, for he died on August 25th, 1688.\r\n\r\nAn extract from the journal of Captain Lawrence Wright, commander of\r\nH.M.S. _Assistance_, dated August, 1688, describes the ceremonies held at\r\nPort Royal at the burial of Morgan, and shows how important and popular a\r\nman he was thought to be. It runs:\r\n\r\n\"Saturday 25. This day about eleven hours noone Sir Henry Morgan died, &\r\nthe 26th was brought over from Passage-fort to the King's house at Port\r\nRoyall, from thence to the Church, & after a sermon was carried to the\r\nPallisadoes & there buried. All the forts fired an equal number of guns,\r\nwee fired two & twenty & after wee & the Drake had fired, all the merchant\r\nmen fired.\"\r\n\r\nMorgan was buried in Jamaica, and his will, which was filed in the Record\r\nOffice at Spanish Town, makes provision for his wife and near relations.\r\n\r\n\r\nMORRICE, HUMPHREY.\r\n\r\nOf New Providence, Bahama Islands.\r\n\r\nHanged at New Providence in 1718 by his lately reformed fellow-pirates,\r\nand on the gallows taxed them with \"pusillanimity and cowardice\" because\r\nthey did not rescue him and his fellow-sufferers.\r\n\r\n\r\nMORRIS, CAPTAIN JOHN.\r\n\r\nOf Jamaica.\r\n\r\nA privateer until 1665, he afterwards became a buccaneer with Mansfield.\r\nTook part in successful raids in Central America, plundering Vildemo in\r\nthe Bay of Campeachy; he also sacked Truxillo, and then, after a journey\r\nby canoe up the San Juan River to take Nicaragua, surprised and plundered\r\nthe city of Granada in March, 1666.\r\n\r\n\r\nMORRIS, CAPTAIN THOMAS.\r\n\r\nOne of the pirates of New Providence, Bahamas, who, on pardon being\r\noffered by King George in 1717, escaped, and for a while carried on piracy\r\nin the West Indian Islands. Caught and hanged a few years afterwards.\r\n\r\n\r\nMORRIS, JOHN.\r\n\r\nOne of Captain Bartholomew Roberts's crew. When the _Royal Fortune_\r\nsurrendered to H.M.S. _Swallow_, Morris fired his pistol into the\r\ngunpowder in the steerage and caused an explosion that killed or maimed\r\nmany of the pirates.\r\n\r\n\r\nMORRISON, CAPTAIN.\r\n\r\nA Scotch pirate, who lived on Prince Edward Island.\r\n\r\nFor an account of his career, see Captain NELSON.\r\n\r\n\r\nMORRISON, WILLIAM.\r\n\r\nOf Jamaica.\r\n\r\nOne of Major Stede Bonnet's crew. Hanged at White Point, Charleston, South\r\nCarolina, on November 8th, 1718, and buried in the marsh below low-water\r\nmark.\r\n\r\n\r\nMORTON, PHILIP.\r\n\r\nGunner on board \"Blackbeard's\" ship, the _Queen Ann's Revenge_. Killed on\r\nNovember 22nd, 1718, in North Carolina, during the fight with Lieutenant\r\nMaynard.\r\n\r\n\r\nMULLET, JAMES, _alias_ MILLET.\r\n\r\nOf London.\r\n\r\nOne of the crew of the _Royal James_, in which vessel Major Stede Bonnet\r\nplayed havoc with the shipping along the coasts of South Carolina and New\r\nEngland. Hanged at Charleston in 1718.\r\n\r\n\r\nMULLINS, DARBY.\r\n\r\nThis Irish pirate was born in the north of Ireland, not many miles from\r\nLondonderry. Being left an orphan at the age of 18, he was sold to a\r\nplanter in the West Indies for a term of four years.\r\n\r\nAfter the great earthquake at Jamaica in 1691, Mullins built himself a\r\nhouse at Kingston and ran it as a punch-house--often a very profitable\r\nbusiness when the buccaneers returned to Port Royal with good plunder.\r\nThis business failing, he went to New York, where he met Captain Kidd, and\r\nwas, according to his own story, persuaded to engage in piracy, it being\r\nurged that the robbing only of infidels, the enemies of Christianity, was\r\nan act, not only lawful, but one highly meritorious.\r\n\r\nAt his trial later on in London his judges did not agree with this view of\r\nthe rights of property, and Mullins was hanged at Execution Dock on May\r\n23rd, 1701.\r\n\r\n\r\nMUMPER, THOMAS.\r\n\r\nAn Indian of Mather's Vineyard, New England.\r\n\r\nTried for piracy with Captain Charles Harris and his men, but found to be\r\n\"not guilty.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nMUNDON, STEPHEN.\r\n\r\nOf London.\r\n\r\nHanged for piracy at Newport, Rhode Island, on July 19th, 1723, at the age\r\nof 20.\r\n\r\n\r\nMUSTAPHA. Turkish pirate.\r\n\r\nIn 1558 he sailed, with a fleet of 140 vessels, to the Island of Minorca.\r\nLanded, and besieged the fortified town of Ciudadda, which at length\r\nsurrendered. The Turks slew great numbers of the inhabitants, taking the\r\nrest away as slaves.\r\n\r\n\r\nNAU, CAPTAIN JEAN DAVID, _alias_ FRANCIS L'OLLONAIS.\r\n\r\nA Frenchman born at Les Sables d'Ollone.\r\n\r\nIn his youth he was transported as an indented labourer to the French\r\nIsland of Dominica in the West Indies. Having served his time L'Ollonais\r\nwent to the Island of Hispaniola, and joined the buccaneers there, living\r\nby hunting wild cattle and drying the flesh or boucan.\r\n\r\nHe then sailed for a few voyages as a sailor before the mast, and acted\r\nwith such ability and courage that the Governor of Tortuga Island,\r\nMonsieur de la Place, gave him the command of a vessel and sent him out\r\nto seek his fortune.\r\n\r\nAt first the young buccaneer was very successful, and he took many Spanish\r\nships, but owing to his ferocious treatment of his prisoners he soon won a\r\nname for cruelty which has never been surpassed. But at the height of this\r\nsuccess his ship was wrecked in a storm, and, although most of the pirates\r\ngot ashore, they were at once attacked by a party of Spaniards, and all\r\nbut L'Ollonais were killed. The captain escaped, after being wounded, by\r\nsmearing blood and sand over his face and hiding himself amongst his dead\r\ncompanions. Disguised as a Spaniard he entered the city of Campeachy,\r\nwhere bonfires and other manifestations of public relief were being held,\r\nto express the joy of the citizens at the news of the death of their\r\nterror, L'Ollonais.\r\n\r\nMeeting with some French slaves, the fugitive planned with them to escape\r\nin the night in a canoe, this being successfully carried out, they\r\neventually arrived back at Tortuga, the pirate stronghold. Here the\r\nenterprising captain stole a small vessel, and again started off \"on the\r\naccount,\" plundering a village called De los Cagos in Cuba. The Governor\r\nof Havana receiving word of the notorious and apparently resurrected\r\npirate's arrival sent a well-armed ship to take him, adding to the ship's\r\ncompany a negro executioner, with orders to hang all the pirate crew with\r\nthe exception of L'Ollonais, who was to be brought back to Havana alive\r\nand in chains.\r\n\r\nInstead of the Spaniards taking the Frenchman, the opposite happened, and\r\neveryone of them was murdered, including the negro hangman, with the\r\nexception of one man, who was sent with a written message to the Governor\r\nto tell him that in future L'Ollonais would kill every Spaniard he met\r\nwith.\r\n\r\nJoining with a famous filibuster, Michael de Basco, L'Ollonais soon\r\norganized a more important expedition, consisting of a fleet of eight\r\nvessels and 400 men. Sailing to the Gulf of Venezuela in 1667, they\r\nentered the lake, destroying the fort that stood to guard the entrance.\r\nThence sailing to the city of Maracaibo they found all the inhabitants had\r\nfled in terror. The filibusters caught many of the inhabitants hiding in\r\nthe neighbouring woods, and killed numbers of them in their attempts to\r\nforce from the rest the hiding-places of their treasure. They next marched\r\nupon and attacked the town of Gibraltar, which was valiantly defended by\r\nthe Spaniards, until the evening, when, having lost 500 men killed, they\r\nsurrendered. For four weeks this town was pillaged, the inhabitants\r\nmurdered, while torture and rape were daily occurrences. At last, to the\r\nrelief of the wretched inhabitants, the buccaneers, with a huge booty,\r\nsailed away to Corso Island, a place of rendezvous of the French\r\nbuccaneers. Here they divided their spoil, which totalled the great sum of\r\n260,000 pieces of eight, which, when divided amongst them, gave each man\r\nabove one hundred pieces of eight, as well as his share of plate, silk,\r\nand jewels.\r\n\r\nAlso, a share was allotted for the next-of-kin of each man killed, and\r\nextra rewards for those pirates who had lost a limb or an eye. L'Ollonais\r\nhad now become most famous amongst the \"Brethren of the Coast,\" and began\r\nto make arrangements for an even more daring expedition to attack and\r\nplunder the coast of Nicaragua. Here he burnt and pillaged ruthlessly,\r\ncommitting the most revolting cruelties on the Spanish inhabitants. One\r\nexample of this monster's inhuman deeds will more than suffice to tell of.\r\nIt happened that during an attack on the town of San Pedros the buccaneers\r\nhad been caught in an ambuscade and many of them killed, although the\r\nSpaniards had at last turned and fled. The pirates killed most of their\r\nprisoners, but kept a few to be questioned by L'Ollonais so as to find\r\nsome other way to the town. As he could get no information out of these\r\nmen, the Frenchman drew his cutlass and with it cut open the breast of one\r\nof the Spaniards, and pulling out his still beating heart he began to bite\r\nand gnaw it with his teeth like a ravenous wolf, saying to the other\r\nprisoners, \"I will serve you all alike, if you show me not another way.\"\r\n\r\nShortly after this, many of the buccaneers broke away from L'Ollonais and\r\nsailed under the command of Moses van Vin, the second in command.\r\nL'Ollonais, in his big ship, sailed to the coast of Honduras, but ran his\r\nvessel on a sand-bank and lost her. While building a new but small craft\r\non one of the Las Pertas Islands, they cultivated beans and other\r\nvegetables, and also wheat, for which they baked bread in portable ovens\r\nwhich these French buccaneers carried about with them. It took them six\r\nmonths to build their long-boat, and when it was finished it would not\r\ncarry more than half the number of buccaneers. Lots were drawn to settle\r\nwho should sail and who remain behind. L'Ollonais steered the boat towards\r\nCartagena, but was caught by the Indians, as described by Esquemeling.\r\n\"Here suddenly his ill-fortune assailed him, which of a long time had been\r\nreserved for him as a punishment due to the multitude of horrible crimes,\r\nwhich in his licentious and wicked life he had committed. For God\r\nAlmighty, the time of His divine justice being now already come, had\r\nappointed the Indians of Darien to be the instruments and executioners\r\nthereof.\"\r\n\r\nThese \"instruments of God,\" having caught L'Ollonais, tore him in pieces\r\nalive, throwing his body limb by limb into the fire and his ashes into the\r\nair, to the intent \"no trace nor memory might remain of such an infamous\r\ninhuman creature.\"\r\n\r\nThus died a monster of cruelty, who would, had he lived to-day, have been\r\nconfined in an asylum for lunatics.\r\n\r\n\r\nNEAL.\r\n\r\nA fisherman of Cork.\r\n\r\nMutinied in a French ship sailing from Cork to Nantes in 1721, and, under\r\nthe leadership of Philip Roche, murdered the captain and many of the crew\r\nand became a pirate.\r\n\r\n\r\nNEFF, WILLIAM.\r\n\r\nBorn at Haverhill, Massachusetts, in 1667.\r\n\r\nA soldier, one of the guard at Fort Loyal, Falmouth, Maine. Deserted in\r\n1689 and went to sea with the pirate Captain Pound.\r\n\r\n\r\nNELSON, CAPTAIN.\r\n\r\nBorn on Prince Edward Island, where his father had a grant of land for\r\nservices rendered in the American war. He was a wealthy man, a member of\r\nthe Council and a Colonel of the Militia. In order to set his son up in\r\nlife he bought him a captaincy in the Militia and a fine farm, where young\r\nNelson married and settled down. Buying a schooner, he used to sail to\r\nHalifax with cargoes of potatoes and fruit. He seems to have liked these\r\ntrips in which he combined business with pleasure, for we learn that on\r\nthese visits to Halifax he \"was very wild, and drank and intrigued with\r\nthe girls in an extravagant manner.\" Getting into disgrace on Prince\r\nEdward Island, and losing his commission, he went to live near Halifax,\r\nand became a lieutenant in the Nova Scotia Fencibles, while his wife\r\nremained on the island to look after his estates, which brought him in\r\n£300 a year. Meeting with a Scotchman called Morrison, together they\r\nbought a \"pretty little New York battleship,\" mounting ten guns. Manning\r\nthis dangerous toy with a crew of ninety desperate characters, the\r\npartners went \"on the account,\" and began well by taking a brig belonging\r\nto Mr. Hill, of Rotherhithe, which they took to New York, and there sold\r\nboth ship and cargo.\r\n\r\nThey next cruised in the West Indies, taking several English and Dutch\r\nships, the crews of which they treated with the greatest brutality.\r\n\r\nLanding on St. Kitts Island, they burnt and plundered two Dutch\r\nplantations, murdering the owners and slaves. Sailing north to\r\nNewfoundland they took ten more vessels, which they sold in New York.\r\nAfter further successful voyages in the West Indies and off the coast of\r\nBrazil, Nelson felt the call of home ties becoming so strong that he\r\nventured to return to Prince Edward Island to visit his wife and family,\r\nwhere no one dared to molest him.\r\n\r\nBy this time Nelson had been a pirate for three years and had, by his\r\nindustry, won for himself a fortune worth £150,000, but his Scotch\r\npartner, Morrison, being a frugal soul, had in the meantime saved an even\r\nlarger sum. Eventually their ship was wrecked in a fog on a small barren\r\nisland near Prince Edward Island, and Morrison and most of the crew were\r\ndrowned, but Nelson and a few others were saved. At last he reached New\r\nYork, where he lived the rest of his life in peaceful happiness with his\r\nwife and family.\r\n\r\n\r\nNICHOLLS, THOMAS, _alias_ NICHOLAS.\r\n\r\nOf London.\r\n\r\nOne of Major Stede Bonnet's crew in the _Royal James_. Tried for piracy at\r\nCharleston on November 8th, 1718, and found \"not guilty.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nNONDRE, PEDRO.\r\n\r\nHanged at Kingston, Jamaica, in February, 1823. At the time of execution\r\nit was observed that he was covered with the marks of deep wounds. On the\r\nscaffold he wept bitterly. An immensely heavy man, he broke the rope, and\r\nhad to be hanged a second time.\r\n\r\n\r\nNORMAN, CAPTAIN. Buccaneer.\r\n\r\nServed under Morgan in 1670, and after the fall of Chagres Fort, Norman\r\nwas left in charge with 500 men to hold it, while Morgan crossed the\r\nisthmus to attack Panama. Norman soon \"sent forth to sea two boats to\r\nexercise piracy.\" These hoisted Spanish colours and met a big Spanish\r\nmerchant ship on the same day. They chased the ship, which fled for safety\r\ninto the Chagres River, only to be caught there by Norman. She proved a\r\nvaluable prize, being loaded with all kinds of provisions, of which the\r\ngarrison was in sore need.\r\n\r\n\r\nNORTH, CAPTAIN NATHANIEL.\r\n\r\nBorn in Bermuda, and by profession a lawyer, Captain North was a man of\r\nremarkable ability, and in his later calling of piracy he gained great\r\nnotoriety, and was a born leader of men. His history has been written\r\nfully, and is well worth reading. He had many ups and downs in his early\r\nseafaring life in the West Indies; being no less than three times taken by\r\nthe pressgang, each time escaping. He served in Dutch and Spanish\r\nprivateers, and eventually rose to being a pirate captain, making his\r\nheadquarters in Madagascar. From here he sailed out to the East Indies,\r\nand preyed on the ships of the East India Company. Several times he was\r\nwrecked, once he was the only survivor, and swam ashore at Madagascar\r\nstark naked. The unusual sight of a naked Englishman spread terror amongst\r\nthe natives who were on the beach, and they all fled into the jungle\r\nexcept one, a woman, who from previous personal experience knew that this\r\nwas but a human being and not a sea devil. She supplied him with clothes,\r\nof a sort, and led him to the nearest pirate settlement, some six miles\r\naway. On another occasion when the pirates were having a jollification\r\nashore, having left their Moorish prisoners on the ship at anchor, North\r\ngave the prisoners a hint to clear off in the night with the ship,\r\notherwise they would all be made slaves. This friendly hint was acted\r\nupon, and in the morning both ship and prisoners had vanished. The pirates\r\nhaving lost their ship took to the peaceful and harmless life of planters,\r\nwith North as their ruler. He won the confidence of the natives, who\r\nabided by his decision in all quarrels and misunderstandings. Occasionally\r\nNorth and his men would join forces with a neighbouring friendly tribe and\r\ngo to war, North leading the combined army, and victory always resulted.\r\nThe call of piracy was too strong in his bones to resist, and after three\r\nyears planting he was back to sea and the Jolly Roger once more. On one\r\noccasion he seized the opportunity, when in the neighbourhood of the\r\nMascarenhas Islands, to go ashore and visit the Catholic priest and\r\nconfess, and at the same time made suitable arrangements for his children\r\nto be educated by the Church. North evidently truly repented his former\r\nsins, for he returned to resume his simple life on his plantation. On\r\narriving home he found the settlement in an uproar. He soon settled all\r\nthe disputes, appeased the natives, and before long had this garden-city\r\nof pirates back in its previous peaceful and happy state. Beyond an\r\noccasional little voyage, taking a ship or two, or burning an Arab\r\nvillage, North's career as a pirate may be considered to have terminated,\r\nas, indeed, his life was shortly afterwards, being murdered in his bed by\r\na treacherous native. North's friends the pirates, shocked at this\r\ncold-blooded murder, waged a ruthless war on the natives for seven years:\r\nthus in their simple way thinking to revenge the loss of this estimable\r\nman, who had always been the natives' best friend.\r\n\r\n\r\nNORTON, GEORGE.\r\n\r\nOne of Captain John Quelch's crew. Tried for piracy in June, 1704, at the\r\nStar Tavern at Boston.\r\n\r\n\r\nNUTT, JOHN.\r\n\r\nOne of Captain John Phillip's original crew of five pirates in the\r\n_Revenge_ in 1723. Nutt was made master or navigator.\r\n\r\n\r\nOCHALI. Barbary renegade.\r\n\r\nIn 1511 he sailed from Algiers with a fleet of twenty-two vessels and\r\n1,700 men to raid Majorca. The Moors landed at Soller and pillaged it.\r\nBefore they could get back to their ship, the pirates were attacked by the\r\nMajorcans, headed by Miguel Angelats, and completely routed, 500 of them\r\nbeing killed.\r\n\r\n\r\nODELL, SAMUEL.\r\n\r\nTaken prisoner by the pirate Captain Teach on November 21st, 1718, and on\r\nthe very next day retaken by Lieutenant Maynard. Odell received no less\r\nthan seventy wounds in the fight, but recovered, and was carried to\r\nVirginia to stand his trial for piracy, and was acquitted.\r\n\r\n\r\nOUGHTERLAUNEY, THOMAS.\r\n\r\nActed as pilot in the _Royal Fortune_. Took an active part in taking and\r\nplundering the _King Solomon_ on the West Coast of Africa in 1721.\r\n\r\nWas tried for piracy with the rest of Roberts's crew, when one witness,\r\nCaptain Trahern, deposed that the prisoner dressed himself up in the\r\ncaptain's best suit of clothes, his new tye wig, and called loudly for a\r\nbottle of wine, and then, very arrogantly, gave orders as to the steering\r\nof the captured ship.\r\n\r\nHanged at Cape Coast Castle in 1722.\r\n\r\n\r\nPAIN, CAPTAIN.\r\n\r\nA Bahaman privateer who in 1683 turned pirate and attacked St. Augustine\r\nin Florida under French colours. Being driven off by the Spaniards, he had\r\nto content himself with looting some neighbouring settlements. On\r\nreturning to New Providence, the Governor attempted, but without success,\r\nto arrest Pain and his crew. Pain afterwards appeared in Rhode Island, and\r\nwhen the authorities tried to seize him and his ship, he got off by\r\nexhibiting an old commission to hunt for pirates given him a long while\r\nbefore by Sir Thomas Lynch. When the West Indies became too hot for him,\r\nPain made the coast of Carolina his headquarters.\r\n\r\n\r\nPAINE, CAPTAIN PETER, _alias_ LE PAIN. A French buccaneer.\r\n\r\nHe brought into Port Royal in 1684 a merchant ship, _La Trompeuse_.\r\nPretending to be the owner, he sold both ship and cargo, which brought\r\nabout great trouble afterwards between the French and English Governments,\r\nbecause he had stolen the ship on the high seas. He was sent from Jamaica\r\nunder arrest to France the same year, to answer for his crimes.\r\n\r\n\r\nPAINTER, PETER.\r\n\r\nThis Carolina pirate retired and lived at Charleston. In August, 1710, he\r\nwas recommended for the position of public powder-receiver, but was\r\nrejected by the Upper House. \"Mr. Painter Having committed Piracy, and\r\nnot having his Majesties Pardon for the same, Its resolved he is not fit\r\nfor that Trust.\" Which only goes to show how hard it was for a man to live\r\ndown a thing like piracy.\r\n\r\n\r\nPARDAL, CAPTAIN MANUEL RIVERO.\r\n\r\nKnown to the Jamaicans as \"the vapouring admiral of St. Jago,\" because in\r\nJuly, 1670, he had nailed a piece of canvas to a tree on the Jamaican\r\ncoast with this curious challenge written both in English and Spanish:\r\n\r\n\"I, Captain Manuel Rivero Pardal, to the chief of the squadron of\r\nprivateers in Jamaica. I am he who this year have done that which follows.\r\nI went on shore at Caimanos, and burnt 20 houses and fought with Captain\r\nAry, and took from him a catch laden with provisions and a canoe. And I am\r\nhe who took Captain Baines and did carry the prize to Cartagena, and now\r\nam arrived to this coast, and have burnt it. And I come to seek General\r\nMorgan, with 2 ships of 20 guns, and having seen this, I crave he would\r\ncome out upon the coast and seek me, that he might see the valour of the\r\nSpaniards. And because I had no time I did not come to the mouth of Port\r\nRoyal to speak by word of mouth in the name of my king, whom God preserve.\r\nDated the 5th of July, 1670.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nPARKER, CAPTAIN WILLIAM. Buccaneer.\r\n\r\nJust after the city of Porto Bello had been made, as the Spanish thought,\r\nimpregnable, by the building of the massive stone fort of San Jerome, the\r\ndaring Parker, with but 200 English desperadoes, took the place by storm,\r\nburning part of the town and getting quickly and safely away with a huge\r\namount of booty.\r\n\r\n\r\nPARKINS, BENJAMIN.\r\n\r\nOne of Captain John Quelch's crew in the brigantine _Charles_. Tried at\r\nBoston for piracy in 1704.\r\n\r\n\r\nPARROT, JAMES.\r\n\r\nOne of Quelch's crew, who turned King's evidence at the trial at Boston in\r\n1704, and thus escaped hanging.\r\n\r\n\r\nPATTERSON, NEAL.\r\n\r\nOf Aberdeen.\r\n\r\nOne of Major Stede Bonnet's crew in the _Royal James_. Hanged at\r\nCharleston, South Carolina, on November 8th, 1718, and buried in the\r\nmarsh.\r\n\r\n\r\nPATTISON, JAMES.\r\n\r\nTried for piracy at Boston in 1704.\r\n\r\n\r\nPEASE, CAPTAIN.\r\n\r\nA low down, latter-day South Sea pirate. Arrived in an armed ship with a\r\nMalay crew at Apia in Samoa in June, 1870, and rescued the pirate Bully\r\nHayes, who was under arrest of the English Consul. He pleased the British\r\ninhabitants of the island by his display of loyalty to Queen Victoria by\r\nfiring a salute of twenty-one guns on her Majesty's birthday.\r\n\r\n\r\nPELL, IGNATIUS.\r\n\r\nBoatswain of the _Royal James_, Major Stede Bonnet's ship. Turned King's\r\nevidence at trial of Bonnet and his crew at Charleston, Carolina, in 1718.\r\n\r\n\r\nPENNER, MAJOR.\r\n\r\nWe have been able to find out nothing of this pirate except that he was at\r\nNew Providence Island in 1718 and took the King's pardon for pirates. He\r\nseems to have returned to the old life and was killed soon after, though\r\nhow this came about is not recorded.\r\n\r\n\r\nPERKINS, BENJAMIN.\r\n\r\nOne of Quelch's crew. Captured at Marblehead in 1704.\r\n\r\n\r\nPERRY, DANIEL.\r\n\r\nOf Guernsey.\r\n\r\nTried for piracy in 1718 at Charleston, South Carolina, and found guilty.\r\nHanged on November 8th at White Point. Buried in the marsh below low-water\r\nmark.\r\n\r\n\r\nPETERSON, CAPTAIN.\r\n\r\nOf Newport, Rhode Island.\r\n\r\nIn 1688 he arrived at Newport in a \"barkalonga\" armed with ten guns and\r\nseventy men. The Governor prosecuted him for piracy, but the grand jury,\r\nwhich consisted of friends and neighbours of Peterson, threw out the bill.\r\nAmong other charges, Peterson was accused of selling some hides and\r\nelephants' teeth to a Boston merchant for £57, being part of the booty he\r\nhad previously taken out of prizes in the West Indies.\r\n\r\n\r\nPETERSON, ERASMUS.\r\n\r\nTried for piracy with the rest of Captain Quelch's crew at Boston. Was\r\nhanged there on June 30th, 1704. When standing on the gallows \"He cryed of\r\ninjustice done him and said, 'It is very hard for so many lives to be\r\ntaken away for a little Gold.' He said his peace was made with God, yet he\r\nfound it extremely hard to forgive those who had wronged him. He told the\r\nExecutioner 'he was a strong man and Prayed to be put out of his misery\r\nas soon as possible.'\"\r\n\r\n\r\nPETERSON, JOHN.\r\n\r\nA Swedish pirate, one of Gow's crew.

French filibuster.\r\n\r\nOf San Domingo.\r\n\r\nIn 1634 was in command of _Le Ruze_, crew of forty men and four guns.\r\n\r\n\r\nPETTY, WILLIAM.\r\n\r\nBorn at Deptford.\r\n\r\nA sailmaker in Captain Roberts's _Royal Fortune_ when the _King Solomon_\r\nwas taken and plundered in West Africa. Petty, as sailmaker, had to see\r\nthat all the sails and canvas aboard the prizes were removed to the pirate\r\nship. Hanged at the age of 30.\r\n\r\n\r\nPHELIPP, CAPTAIN WILLIAM.\r\n\r\nIn 1533 a Portuguese merchant, Peter Alves, engaged Phelipp to pilot his\r\nship, the _Santa Maria Desaie_, from Tenby to Bastabill Haven. Off the\r\nWelsh coast the ship was attacked by a pirate vessel called the\r\n_Furtuskewys_, with a crew of thirty-five pirates. Alves was put ashore on\r\nthe Welsh coast, and the two ships then sailed to Cork, where the ship and\r\nher cargo were sold to the mayor for 1,524 crowns.\r\n\r\nAlves complained to the King of England, and orders were sent to the Mayor\r\nof Cork, Richard Gowllys, to give up the ship, which he refused to do, but\r\nby way of excusing his actions he explained that he thought the ship was a\r\nScotch one and not a Portuguese.\r\n\r\n\r\nPHILLIPS, CAPTAIN.\r\n\r\nIn 1723 this noted pirate took a sloop, the _Dolphin_, of Cape Ann, on the\r\nBanks of Newfoundland. The crew of the _Dolphin_ were compelled by\r\nPhillips to join the pirates. Amongst the prisoners was a fisherman, John\r\nFillmore. Finding no opportunity to escape, Fillmore with another sailor,\r\nEdward Cheesman, and an Indian, suddenly seized and killed Phillips and\r\nthe two other chief pirates. The rest of the crew agreeing, the ship was\r\ntaken to Boston.\r\n\r\n\r\nPHILIPS, JAMES.\r\n\r\nOf the Island of Antigua.\r\n\r\nFormerly of the _Revenge_, and afterwards in the _Royal Fortune_ (Captain\r\nRoberts). When the _Royal Fortune_ surrendered in 1722 to H.M.S.\r\n_Swallow_, Philips seized a lighted match and attempted to blow up the\r\nship, swearing he would \"send them all to Hell together,\" but was\r\nprevented by the master, Glasby. Hanged at the age of 35.\r\n\r\n\r\nPHILLIPS, JOHN.\r\n\r\nA carpenter by trade, he sailed from the West Country for Newfoundland in\r\na ship that was captured by the pirate Anstis in the _Good Fortune_.\r\nPhillips soon became reconciled to the life of a pirate, and, being a\r\nbrisk fellow, he was appointed carpenter to the ship. Returning to England\r\nhe soon found it necessary to quit the country again, and he shipped\r\nhimself on board a vessel at Topsham for Newfoundland. On arriving at\r\nPeter Harbour he ran away, and hired himself as a splitter to the\r\nNewfoundland cod fishery.\r\n\r\nOn the night of August 29th, 1723, with four others, he stole a vessel in\r\nthe harbour and sailed away. Phillips was chosen captain. Articles were\r\nnow drawn up and were sworn to upon a hatchet, because no Bible could be\r\nfound on board. Amongst other laws was the punishment of \"40 stripes\r\nlacking one, known as Moses's law, to be afflicted for striking a\r\nfellow-pirate.\" The last law of the nine casts a curious light on these\r\nmurderers; it runs: \"If at any time you meet with a prudent Woman, that\r\nMan that offers to meddle with her, without her Consent, shall suffer\r\npresent Death.\" The pirates, fortified by these laws, met with instant\r\nsuccess, taking several fishing vessels, from which they augmented their\r\nsmall crew by the addition of several likely and brisk seamen. Amongst\r\nthese they had the good fortune to take prisoner an old pirate called John\r\nRose Archer, who had served his pirate apprenticeship under the able\r\ntuition of the famous Blackbeard, and who they at once promoted to be\r\nquartermaster. This quick promotion caused trouble afterwards, for some of\r\nthe original crew, particularly carpenter Fern, resented it. The pirates\r\nnext sailed to Barbadoes, that happy hunting ground, but for three months\r\nnever a sail did they meet with, so that they were almost starving for\r\nwant of provisions, being reduced to a pound of dried meat a day amongst\r\nten of them.\r\n\r\nAt last they met with a French vessel, a Martinico ship, of twelve guns,\r\nand hunger drove them to attack even so big a ship as this, but the sight\r\nof the Black flag so terrified the French crew that they surrendered\r\nwithout firing a shot. After this, they took several vessels, and matters\r\nbegan to look much brighter. Phillips quickly developed into a most\r\naccomplished and bloody pirate, butchering his prisoners on very little or\r\non no provocation whatever. But even this desperate pirate had an\r\noccasional \"qualm of conscience come athwart his stomach,\" for when he\r\ncaptured a Newfoundland vessel and was about to scuttle her, he found out\r\nthat she was the property of a Mr. Minors of that island, from whom they\r\nstole the original vessel in which they went a-pirating, so Phillips,\r\ntelling his companions \"We have done him enough injury already,\" ordered\r\nthe vessel to be repaired and returned to the owner. On another occasion,\r\nthey took a ship, the master of which was a \"Saint\" of New England, by\r\nname Dependance Ellery, who gave them a pretty chase before being\r\noverhauled, and so, as a punishment, the \"Saint\" was compelled to dance\r\nthe deck until he fell down exhausted.\r\n\r\nThis pirate's career ended with a mutiny of his unruly crew, Phillips\r\nbeing tripped up and then thrown overboard to drown off Newfoundland in\r\nApril, 1724.\r\n\r\nDuring the nine months of Phillips's command as a pirate captain, he\r\naccounted for more than thirty ships.\r\n\r\n\r\nPHILLIPS, JOSEPH.\r\n\r\nOne of Teach's crew. Hanged in Virginia in 1718.\r\n\r\n\r\nPHILLIPS, WILLIAM.\r\n\r\nBorn at Lower Shadwell.\r\n\r\nBoatswain in the _King Solomon_, a Guinea merchant ship. This ship, while\r\nlying at anchor in January, 1721, was attacked by a boatful of pirates\r\nfrom Bartholomew Roberts's ship, the _Royal Fortune_. The captain of the\r\n_King Solomon_ fired a musket at the approaching boat, and called upon his\r\ncrew to do the same, but Phillips called for quarter and persuaded the\r\nrest of the crew to lay down their arms and surrender the ship. Phillips\r\neagerly joined the pirates and signed the articles, and was \"very forward\r\nand brisk\" in helping to rob his own ship of provisions and stores.\r\n\r\nAt his trial at Cape Coast Castle, he pleaded, as nearly all the prisoners\r\ndid, that he was compelled to sign the pirates' articles, which were\r\noffered to him on a dish, on which lay a loaded pistol beside the copy of\r\nthe articles.\r\n\r\nFound guilty and hanged in April, 1722, within the flood marks at Cape\r\nCoast Castle, in his 29th year.\r\n\r\n\r\nPHIPS, RICHARD.\r\n\r\nAn English soldier who deserted from Fort Loyal, Falmouth, Maine, in 1689.\r\nWounded by a bullet in the head at Tarpaulin Cove. Taken to Boston Prison,\r\nwhere he died.\r\n\r\n\r\nPICKERING, CAPTAIN CHARLES.\r\n\r\nCommanded the _Cinque Ports_ galley, sixteen guns, crew of sixty-three\r\nmen, and accompanied Dampier on his voyage in 1703. Died off the coast of\r\nBrazil in the same year.\r\n\r\n\r\nPIERSE, GEORGE.\r\n\r\nTried for piracy along with the rest of the crew of the brigantine\r\n_Charles_, at Boston, in 1704.\r\n\r\n\r\nPITMAN, JOHN.\r\n\r\nOne of Captain Quelch's crew. Tried for piracy at Boston in 1704.\r\n\r\n\r\nPOLEAS, PEDRO. Spanish pirate.\r\n\r\nCo-commander with Captain Johnson of a pirate sloop, the _Two Brothers_.\r\nIn March, 1731, took a ship, the _John and Jane_ (Edward Burt, master),\r\nsouth of Jamaica, on board of which was a passenger, John Cockburn, who\r\nafterwards wrote a book relating his adventures on a journey on foot of\r\n240 miles on the mainland of America.\r\n\r\n\r\nPORTER, CAPTAIN.\r\n\r\nA West Indian pirate, who commanded a sloop, and, in company with a\r\nCaptain Tuckerman in another sloop, came one day into Bennet's Key in\r\nHispaniola. The two captains were but beginners at piracy, and finding\r\nthe great Bartholomew Roberts in the bay, paid him a polite visit, hoping\r\nto pick up a few wrinkles from the \"master.\" This scene is described by\r\nCaptain Johnson, in his \"Lives of the Pirates,\" when Porter and his friend\r\n\"addressed the Pyrate, as the Queen of Sheba did Solomon, to wit, That\r\nhaving heard of his Fame and Achievements, they had put in there to learn\r\nhis Art and Wisdom in the Business of pyrating, being Vessels on the same\r\nhonourable Design with himself; and hoped with the Communication of his\r\nKnowledge, they should also receive his Charity, being in want of\r\nNecessaries for such Adventures. Roberts was won upon by the Peculiarity\r\nand Bluntness of these two Men and gave them Powder, Arms, and what ever\r\nelse they had Occasion for, spent two or three merry Nights with them, and\r\nat parting, said, he hoped the L---- would Prosper their handy Works.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nPOUND, CAPTAIN THOMAS.\r\n\r\nOn August 8th, 1689, this pirate, with five men and a boy, sailed out of\r\nBoston Harbour as passengers in a small vessel. When off Lovell's Island,\r\nfive other armed men joined them. Pound now seized the craft and took\r\ncommand, and declared his intention of going on a piratical cruise. The\r\nfirst vessel they met with they decided to take. It was a fishing boat.\r\nPound ran his craft alongside, but at the last moment his heart failed\r\nhim, and he merely bought eight penn'o'th of mackerel from the surprised\r\nfishermen.\r\n\r\nHe then sailed to Falmouth, Maine, where the corporal and soldiers of the\r\nguard at the fort deserted in the night and sailed off with Pound and his\r\ncrew. Fortified by this addition to his crew, the pirate attacked a sloop,\r\nthe _Good Speed_, off Cape Cod, and a brigantine, the _Merrimack_, and\r\nseveral other prizes. By this time, the Governor at Boston had heard of\r\nPound's escapades, and sent an armed sloop, the _Mary_, to search for him.\r\nThe pirate was discovered in Tarpaulin Cove, and a fierce and bloody fight\r\ntook place before the pirates struck their \"Red flagg.\" The prisoners were\r\ncast into Boston Gaol to await their trial. Pound had been wounded, being\r\nshot in the arm and side. The trial took place on January 13th, 1690.\r\nPound was found guilty, but reprieved, and was sent to England, but was\r\nlater on liberated. Afterwards he got command of a ship. He died in\r\nEngland in 1703.\r\n\r\n\r\nPOWELL, THOMAS.\r\n\r\nOf Connecticut, New England.\r\n\r\nOne of Captain Charles Harris's crew. Hanged at Newport, Rhode Island, on\r\nJuly 19th, 1723, at the age of 21.\r\n\r\n\r\nPOWER, JOHN.\r\n\r\nBorn in the West of England.\r\n\r\nServed in a slave vessel, the _Polly_ (Captain Fox, commander), on a\r\nvoyage to the coast of West Africa. While the captain was on shore, the\r\ncrew ran away with the ship, turned pirates, called their vessel the\r\n_Bravo_, and elected Power to be captain and sailed to the West Indies.\r\nArrived there, he tried to sell his cargo of slaves, but being suspected\r\nof having stolen them, he thought it best to sail to New York. Here the\r\npirates got ashore, but the ship's surgeon informed the authorities, and\r\nPower was arrested and sent to England, where he was tried, and hanged at\r\nExecution Dock on March 10th, 1768.\r\n\r\n\r\nPRICE, THOMAS.\r\n\r\nOf Bristol.\r\n\r\nHanged at Charleston, South Carolina, on November 8th, 1718. One of Major\r\nStede Bonnet's crew.\r\n\r\n\r\nPRIMER, MATTHEW.\r\n\r\nOne of Captain Quelch's crew. Turned King's evidence at the trial for\r\npiracy held at the Star Tavern, Boston, in June, 1704.\r\n\r\n\r\nPRINCE, CAPTAIN LAWRENCE.\r\n\r\nIn 1760 this buccaneer sacked the city of Granada in company with Captains\r\nHarris and Ludbury. Late in the same year, Prince, with the rank of\r\nLieut.-Colonel, led the vanguard in the attack on Panama.\r\n\r\n\r\nPRO, CAPTAIN.\r\n\r\nThis Dutch South Sea pirate owned a small plantation in Madagascar, and\r\nwas joined there by the pirate Williams after he had escaped from slavery.\r\nBoth were taken prisoner by an English frigate. In a fight with the\r\nnatives, the pirate crew was defeated, but Pro and Williams managed to\r\nescape and to reach some friendly natives. Procuring a boat, they sailed\r\naway to join some other pirates at Methulage in Madagascar.\r\n\r\n\r\nPROWSE, CAPTAIN LAWRENCE.\r\n\r\nA Devon man, a noted sea captain, and a terror to the Spaniards. Was\r\nimprisoned by King James I. at the instance of the King of Spain for\r\npiracy and was to have been executed, but English public feeling ran so\r\nhigh that Prowse was discharged.\r\n\r\n\r\nPULLING, CAPTAIN JOHN.\r\n\r\nCommanded the _Fame_, which set out in 1703 in company with Dampier in the\r\n_St. George_ on a plundering expedition to the South Seas. Their\r\ncommissions were to attack only Spanish and French ships. The two\r\ncaptains quarrelled at the very beginning of the voyage, while lying off\r\nthe Downs, and Pulling slipped away by himself to go a-pirating amongst\r\nthe Canary Islands.\r\n\r\n\r\nPURSSER, CAPTAIN.\r\n\r\nIn the sixteenth century this pirate became notorious for his piracies off\r\nthe coast of Wales, and with Calles and Clinton, two other pirates, \"grew\r\nfamous, till Queene Elizabeth of blessed memory, hanged them at Wapping.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nQUELCH, CAPTAIN JOHN.\r\n\r\nA native of Massachusetts Colony.\r\n\r\nIn 1703 was one of the crew of the brigantine _Charles_, eighty tons,\r\nowned by some leading citizens of Boston, and fitted out to go\r\nprivateering off the coasts of Arcadia and Newfoundland. On leaving\r\nMarblehead the crew mutinied, locked the captain in his cabin, and elected\r\nQuelch their commander. They sailed to the south, and shortly afterwards\r\nthrew the captain overboard. They hoisted a flag, the \"Old Roger,\"\r\ndescribed as having \"in the middle of it an Anatomy with an Hourglars in\r\none hand and a dart in the Heart with three drops of Blood proceeding from\r\nit in the other.\" They took nine Portuguese vessels off the coast of\r\nBrazil, out of which they took plunder of very great value.\r\n\r\nQuelch now had the audacity to sail back to Marblehead, where his crew\r\nlanded and quickly scattered with their plunder. Within a week Quelch was\r\nin gaol, and was taken to Boston, where his trial began on June 17th,\r\n1704, and he was found guilty. The days between the sentence and the\r\nexecution must have, indeed, been trying for the prisoner. We read in a\r\npamphlet published at the time: \"The Ministers of the Town used more than\r\nordinary Endeavours to Instruct the Prisoners and bring them to\r\nRepentance. There were Sermons Preached in their hearing Every Day, and\r\nPrayer daily made with them. And they were Catechised, and they had many\r\noccasional Exhortations. And nothing was left that could be done for their\r\nGood.\"\r\n\r\nOn Friday, June 30th, 1704, Quelch and his companions marched on foot\r\nthrough the town of Boston to Scarlil's Wharf with a strong armed guard of\r\nmusketeers, accompanied by various officials and two ministers, while in\r\nfront was carried a silver oar, the emblem of a pirate's execution. Before\r\nthe last act the minister gave a long and fervent harangue to the wretched\r\nculprits, in all of whom were observed suitable signs of repentance except\r\nQuelch, who, stepping forward on the platform, his hat in his hand, and\r\nbowing left and right to the spectators, gave a short address, in which he\r\nwarned them \"They should take care how they brought Money into New England\r\nto be Hanged for it.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nQUITTANCE, JOHN.\r\n\r\nOne of Captain Quelch's crew of the brigantine _Charles_. Tried with the\r\nrest of that crew at the Star Tavern at Boston in June, 1704.\r\n\r\n\r\nRACKAM, CAPTAIN JOHN, _alias_ CALICO JACK.\r\n\r\nServed as quartermaster in Captain Vane's company. On one occasion Vane\r\nrefused to fight a big French ship, and in consequence was dismissed his\r\nship and marooned on an uninhabited island off the coast of America, while\r\nthe crew elected Rackam to be their captain in his place. This was on\r\nNovember 24th, 1718, and on the very first day of his command he had the\r\ngood fortune to take and plunder several small vessels.\r\n\r\nOff the Island of Jamaica they took a Madeira ship, and found an old\r\nfriend on board as a passenger--a Mr. Hosea Tisdell, who kept a tavern in\r\nthe island, and they treated him with great respect.\r\n\r\nChristmas Day coming, the pirates landed on a small island to celebrate\r\nthis festival in a thorough manner, carousing and drinking as long as the\r\nliquor lasted, when they sailed away to seek more. Their next prize was a\r\nstrange one. On coming alongside a ship, she surrendered, and the pirates\r\nboarding her to examine her cargo, found it to consist of thieves from\r\nNewgate on their way to the plantations. Taking two more vessels, Rackam\r\nsailed to the Bahama Islands, but the Governor, Captain Woodes Rogers,\r\nsent a sloop, which took away their prizes.\r\n\r\nRackam now sailed his ship to a snug little cove he knew of in Cuba, where\r\nhe had more than one lady acquaintance. Here the pirates were very happy\r\nuntil all their provisions and money was spent. Just as they were about to\r\nsail, in comes a Spanish Guarda del Costa with a small English sloop which\r\nthey had recently taken. Rackam was now in a very awkward position, being\r\nunable to get past the Spaniard, and all he could do was to hide behind a\r\nsmall island. Night came on, and when it was dark Rackam put all his crew\r\ninto a boat, rowed quietly up to the sloop, clambered aboard, threatening\r\ninstant death to the Spanish guards if they cried out, then cut the cables\r\nand sailed out of the bay. As soon as it was light the Spanish ship\r\ncommenced a furious bombardment of Rackam's empty vessel, thinking he was\r\nstill aboard her.\r\n\r\nIn the summer of 1720 he took numbers of small vessels and fishing boats,\r\nbut nothing very rich, and was not above stealing the fishermen's nets and\r\nlanding and taking cattle. In October Rackam was chased near Nigril Bay by\r\na Government sloop commanded by a Captain Barret. After a short fight\r\nRackam surrendered, and was carried a prisoner to Port Royal.\r\n\r\nOn November 16th Rackam and his crew were tried at St. Jago de la Vega,\r\nconvicted and sentenced to death. Amongst the crew were two women dressed\r\nas men, Anne Bonny and Mary Read. The former was married, in pirate\r\nfashion, to Rackam.\r\n\r\nOn the morning of his execution Rackam was allowed, as a special favour,\r\nto visit his Anne, but all the comfort he got from her was \"that she was\r\nsorry to see him there, but if he had fought like a man, he need not have\r\nbeen hanged like a Dog.\"\r\n\r\nRackam was hanged on November 17th, 1720, at Gallows Point, at Port Royal,\r\nJamaica.\r\n\r\n\r\nRAPHAELINA, CAPTAIN.\r\n\r\nMuch dreaded by the merchant sailors navigating the South Atlantic. In\r\n1822 he controlled a fleet of pirate vessels in the vicinity of Cape\r\nAntonio.\r\n\r\n\r\nRAYNER, CAPTAIN.\r\n\r\nIn a letter to the Lords of Trade, dated from Philadelphia, February 28th,\r\n1701, William Penn mentions that several of Captain Kidd's men had settled\r\nas planters in Carolina with Rayner as their captain.\r\n\r\n\r\nRAYNOR, WILLIAM.\r\n\r\nOne of Captain John Quelch's crew. Tried at Boston in 1704.\r\n\r\n\r\nREAD, CAPTAIN.\r\n\r\nCommanded a brigantine which had its headquarters at Madagascar. Rescued\r\nthe pirate Thomas White. Read died at sea.\r\n\r\n\r\nREAD, MARY. Woman pirate.\r\n\r\nBorn in London of obscure parentage; all that is known for certain is that\r\nher mother was a \"young and airy widow.\" Mary was brought up as a boy, and\r\nat the age of 13 was engaged as a footboy to wait on a French lady. Having\r\na roving spirit, Mary ran away and entered herself on board a man-of-war.\r\nDeserting a few years later, she enlisted in a regiment of foot and fought\r\nin Flanders, showing on all occasions great bravery, but quitted the\r\nservice to enlist in a regiment of horse. Her particular comrade in this\r\nregiment was a Fleming, with whom she fell in love and disclosed to him\r\nthe secret of her sex. She now dressed as a woman, and the two troopers\r\nwere married, \"which made a great noise,\" and several of her officers\r\nattended the nuptials. She and her husband got their discharge and kept an\r\neating house or ordinary, the Three Horseshoes, near the Castle of Breda.\r\nThe husband died, and Mary once again donned male attire and enlisted in a\r\nregiment in Holland. Soon tiring of this, she deserted, and shipped\r\nherself aboard a vessel bound for the West Indies. This ship was taken by\r\nan English pirate, Captain Rackam, and Mary joined his crew as a seaman.\r\n\r\nShe was at New Providence Island, Bahama, when Woodes Rogers came there\r\nwith the royal pardon to all pirates, and she shipped herself aboard a\r\nprivateer sent out by Rogers to cruise against the Spaniards. The crew\r\nmutinied and again became pirates. She now sailed under Captain Rackam,\r\nwho had with him another woman pirate, Anne Bonny. They took a large\r\nnumber of ships belonging to Jamaica, and out of one of these took\r\nprisoner \"a young fellow of engaging behaviour\" with whom Mary fell deeply\r\nin love. This young fellow had a quarrel with one of the pirates, and as\r\nthe ship lay at anchor they were to go to fight it out on shore according\r\nto pirate law. Mary, to save her lover, picked a quarrel with the same\r\npirate, and managed to have her duel at once, and fighting with sword and\r\npistol killed him on the spot.\r\n\r\nShe now married the young man \"of engaging behaviour,\" and not long after\r\nwas taken prisoner with Captain Rackam and the rest of the crew to\r\nJamaica. She was tried at St. Jago de la Vega in Jamaica, and on November\r\n28th, 1720, was convicted, but died in prison soon after of a violent\r\nfever.\r\n\r\nThat Mary Read was a woman of great spirit is shown by her reply to\r\nCaptain Rackam, who had asked her (thinking she was a young man) what\r\npleasure she could find in a life continually in danger of death by fire,\r\nsword, or else by hanging; to which Mary replied \"that as to hanging, she\r\nthought it no great Hardship, for were it not for that, every cowardly\r\nFellow would turn Pirate and so unfit the Seas, that Men of Courage must\r\nstarve.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nREAD, ROBERT.\r\n\r\nTried for piracy with Gow's crew at Newgate in 1725, and acquitted.\r\n\r\n\r\nREAD, WILLIAM.\r\n\r\nOf Londonderry, Ireland.\r\n\r\nOne of Captain Harris's crew.

Cruised in\r\nthe West Indies and along the coast of Carolina and Virginia.\r\n\r\nIn 1717 Teach blockaded the harbour at Charleston and sent Richards with a\r\nparty of pirates to the Governor to demand a medicine chest and all\r\nnecessary medical supplies, with a threat that if these were not\r\nforthcoming he would cut the throats of all his prisoners, many of them\r\nthe leading merchants of the town. While waiting for the Governor's reply,\r\nRichards and his companions scandalized the towns-folk of Charleston by\r\ntheir outrageous and swaggering conduct.\r\n\r\n\r\nRICHARDSON, JOHN.\r\n\r\nHis father was a goldsmith at New York. John, tiring of the trade of\r\ncooper, to which he was apprenticed, ran away to sea. For many years he\r\nserved both in men-of-war and in merchant ships. Although an unmitigated\r\nblackguard, he did not commit piracy nor murder until some years later,\r\nwhen, being at Ancona, he met a Captain Benjamin Hartley, who had come\r\nthere with a loading of pilchards. Richardson was taken on board to serve\r\nas ship's carpenter, and sailed for Leghorn. With another sailor called\r\nCoyle, Richardson concocted a mutiny, murdered the captain in the most\r\nbrutal manner, and was appointed mate in the pirate ship. As a pirate\r\nRichardson was beneath contempt. His life ended on the gallows at\r\nExecution Dock on January 25th, 1738.\r\n\r\n\r\nRICHARDSON, NICHOLAS.\r\n\r\nOne of Captain Quelch's crew.

Hanged in 1718 at Charleston, South\r\nCarolina.\r\n\r\n\r\nRINGROSE, BASIL. Buccaneer, pirate, and author.\r\n\r\nSailed in 1679 to the West Indies. A year later Ringrose had joined the\r\nbuccaneers at their rendezvous in the Gulf of Darien, where they were\r\npreparing for a bold enterprise on the Spanish Main. They landed and\r\nmarched to the town of Santa Maria, which they plundered and burnt.\r\nThence they travelled in canoes down the river to the Bay of Panama. After\r\nattacking the Spanish fleet and laying siege to the city, the buccaneers\r\ncruised up and down the West Coast of South America for eighteen months,\r\nsacking towns and attacking Spanish ships. All this while Ringrose kept a\r\nvery full and graphic journal, in which he recorded not only their\r\nexploits, but also their hardships and quarrels, and gave descriptions as\r\nwell of the various natives and their customs, and drew charts and\r\nsketches.\r\n\r\nIn 1681 Ringrose was still with Captain Sharp, and sailed through the\r\nStraits of Magellan, and on January 30th of the same year anchored off\r\nAntigua. Here he got a passage in a ship to England, landing safely at\r\nDartmouth on March 26th.\r\n\r\nA year later he published an account of his voyage, as a second volume to\r\nEsquemeling's, \"Bucaniers of America.\" In 1684 he went to sea again in the\r\n_Cygnet_ (Captain Swan), to traffic with the Spanish colonies. But the\r\nSpaniards refused to trade with them. In October, 1684, they met the\r\nfamous Captain Edward Davis at that favourite haunt of the buccaneers, the\r\nIsle of Plate. The two captains agreed to join forces and to go together\r\n\"on the account,\" so all the cargo was thrown overboard the _Cygnet_, and\r\nthe ships set out to make war on any Spanish ships they might meet with.\r\n\r\nIn February, 1686, Ringrose with one hundred men took the town of Santiago\r\nin Mexico, but while returning with the plunder to their ship were caught\r\nby the Spaniards in an ambush, and Ringrose was killed.\r\n\r\nRingrose never attained any rank among the buccaneers beyond occasionally\r\nbeing put in charge of a boat or a small company on shore, but as a\r\nrecorder of the doings of his companions he proved both careful and\r\npainstaking. Dampier had a great regard for him, and in his book he\r\nwrites: \"My ingenious friend Ringrose had no mind to this voyage, but was\r\nnecessitated to engage in it or starve.\"\r\n\r\nThe title of Ringrose's book, first published in 1685, is \"The Dangerous\r\nVoyage and Bold Assaults of Captain Bartholomew Sharp and Others.\"\r\n\r\nWritten by Mr. Basil Ringrose.\r\n\r\nPrinted for William Crooke, 1685.\r\n\r\n\r\nROACH, PETER.\r\n\r\nWhen Captain Quelch was captured with his crew, Roach escaped near the\r\nCape by Snake Island. He was afterwards captured and thrown into the gaol\r\nat Salem. Tried for piracy at the Star Tavern at Boston, and on June 30th,\r\n1704, was hanged. At the place of execution Roach disappointed the\r\nonlooking crowd, as, instead of the expected and hoped-for repentant\r\nspeech, \"he seemed little concerned, and said but little or nothing at\r\nall.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nROB, ALEXANDER.\r\n\r\nOne of Captain Gow's crew. Hanged at Execution Dock, Wapping, in June,\r\n1724. He was not one of the original crew of the _George_ galley, but was\r\ntaken out of a prize and joined the pirates of his own free-will.\r\n\r\n\r\nROBBINS, JAMES.\r\n\r\nHanged in Virginia in 1718 along with the rest of Captain Teach's crew.\r\n\r\n\r\nROBBINS, JAMES.\r\n\r\nOf London.\r\n\r\nOne of the crew of the _Royal James_. Hanged in 1718 at Charleston, South\r\nCarolina.\r\n\r\n\r\nROBERTS, CAPTAIN BARTHOLOMEW. Welsh pirate.\r\n\r\nBorn 1682. Died 1722.\r\n\r\nIf a pirate is to be reckoned by the amount of damage he does and the\r\nnumber of ships he takes there can be no doubt that Captain Roberts should\r\nbe placed at the very head of his profession, for he is said to have taken\r\nover 400 vessels. The only man who can be said to rival him is Sir Henry\r\nMorgan, but Morgan, although in some ways an unmitigated blackguard, was a\r\nman of much greater breadth of outlook than Roberts ever was, and,\r\nmoreover, was a buccaneer rather than a pirate.\r\n\r\nRoberts, like many other successful pirates, was born in Wales, not far\r\nfrom Haverfordwest. He is described as being \"a tall black man,\" and was\r\nabout 40 years of age at the time of his death. He was remarkable, even\r\namong his remarkable companions, for several things. First of all, he only\r\ndrank tea--thus being the only total abstainer known to the fraternity.\r\nAlso he was a strict disciplinarian, and on board his ships all lights had\r\nto be extinguished by 8 p.m., any of the crew who wished to continue\r\ndrinking after that hour had to do so on the open deck. But try as he\r\nwould this ardent apostle of abstemiousness was unable to put down\r\ndrinking. If Roberts had lived to-day, no doubt he would have been on the\r\ncouncil of the local vigilance committee. He would allow no women aboard\r\nhis ships, in fact he made it a law that any man who brought a woman on\r\nboard disguised as a man was to suffer death. Roberts allowed no games at\r\ncards or dice to be played for money, as he strongly disapproved of\r\ngambling. He was a strict Sabbatarian, and allowed the musicians to have a\r\nrest on the seventh day. This was as well, for the post of musician on a\r\npirate ship was no sinecure, as every pirate had the right to demand a\r\ntune at any hour of the day or night. He used to place a guard to protect\r\nall his women prisoners, and it is sadly suspicious that there was always\r\nthe greatest competition amongst the worst characters in the ship to be\r\nappointed sentinel over a good-looking woman prisoner. All quarrels had to\r\nbe settled on shore, pirate fashion, the duellists standing back to back\r\narmed with pistol and cutlass. Roberts would have no fighting among the\r\ncrew on board his ship.\r\n\r\nBartholomew must have looked the very part of a pirate when dressed for\r\naction. A tall, dark man, he used to wear a rich damask waistcoat and\r\nbreeches, a red feather in his cap, a gold chain round his neck with a\r\nlarge diamond cross dangling from it, a sword in his hand, and two pairs\r\nof pistols hanging at the end of a silk sling flung over his shoulders.\r\n\r\nWe first hear of Roberts as sailing, in honest employ, as master of the\r\n_Princess_ (Captain Plumb), from London in November, 1719, bound for the\r\ncoast of Guinea to pick up a cargo of \"black ivory\" at Anamaboe. Here his\r\nship was taken by the Welsh pirate Howel Davis. At first Roberts was\r\ndisinclined for the pirate life, but soon changed his mind.\r\n\r\nOn the death of Davis there were several candidates for the post of\r\ncommander, all brisk and lively men, distinguished by the title of\r\n\"Lords,\" such as Sympson, Ashplant, Anstis, and others. One of these\r\n\"Lords,\" Dennis, concluded an eloquent harangue over a bowl of punch with\r\na strong appeal for Roberts to be the new chief. This proposal was\r\nacclaimed with but one dissenting voice, that of \"Lord\" Sympson, who had\r\nhopes of being elected himself, and who sullenly left the meeting swearing\r\n\"he did not care who they chose captain so it was not a papist.\" So\r\nRoberts was elected after being a pirate only six weeks; thus was true\r\nmerit quickly appreciated and rewarded amongst them.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CAPTAIN BARTHOLOMEW ROBERTS.\r\n\r\nTo face p. 262.]\r\n\r\nRoberts's speech to his fellow-pirates was short but to the point, saying\r\n\"that since he had dipped his hands in muddy water, and must be a pyrate,\r\nit was better being a commander than a common man,\" not perhaps a graceful\r\nnor grateful way of expressing his thanks, but one which was no doubt\r\nunderstood by his audience.\r\n\r\nRoberts began his career in a bright manner, for to revenge the perfectly\r\njustifiable death of their late captain he seized and razed the fort,\r\nbombarded the town, and setting on fire two Portuguese ships so as to act\r\nas torches, sailed away the same night. Sailing to Brazil they found in\r\nthe Bay of Bahia a fleet of forty-two Portuguese ships ready laden and on\r\nthe point of leaving for Lisbon, and Roberts, with the most astounding\r\nboldness, sailed right in amongst them until he found the deepest laden,\r\nwhich he attacked and boarded, although his was a much smaller ship. He\r\nsailed away with his prize from the harbour. This prize, amongst the\r\nmerchandise, contained 40,000 moidors and a cross of diamonds designed for\r\nthe King of Portugal.\r\n\r\nHe then took a Dutch ship, and two days later an English one, and sailed\r\nback to Brazil, refitting and cleaning at the Island of Ferdinando.\r\n\r\nIn a work such as this is, it is impossible to recount all, or even a few,\r\nof the daring adventures, or the piratical ups and downs of one pirate.\r\nRoberts sailed to the West Indies devastating the commerce of Jamaica and\r\nBarbadoes. When things grew too hot there, he went north to Newfoundland,\r\nand played the very devil with the English and French fishing fleets and\r\nsettlements.\r\n\r\nHis first ship he called the _Fortune_, his next, a bigger ship, the\r\n_Royal Fortune_, another the _Good Fortune_.\r\n\r\nOn two occasions Roberts had been very roughly handled, once by a ship\r\nfrom Barbadoes and once by the inhabitants of Martinica, so when he\r\ndesigned his new flag, he portrayed on it a huge figure of himself\r\nstanding sword in hand upon two skulls, and under these were the letters\r\nA.B.H. and A.M.H., signifying a Barbadian's and a Martinican's head.\r\n\r\nIn April, 1721, Roberts was back again on the Guinea Coast, burning and\r\nplundering. Amongst the prisoners he took out of one of his prizes was a\r\nclergyman. The captain dearly wished to have a chaplain on board his ship\r\nto administer to the spiritual welfare of his crew, and tried all he could\r\nto persuade the parson to sign on, promising him that his only duties\r\nshould be to say prayers and make punch. But the prelate begged to be\r\nexcused, and was at length allowed to go with all his belongings, except\r\nthree prayer-books and a corkscrew--articles which were sorely needed\r\naboard the _Royal Fortune_.\r\n\r\nThe end of Roberts's career was now in sight. A King's ship, the _Swallow_\r\n(Captain Chaloner Ogle), discovered Roberts's ships at Parrot Island, and,\r\npretending to fly from them, was followed out to sea by one of the\r\npirates. A fight took place, and after two hours the pirates struck,\r\nflinging overboard their black flag \"that it might not rise in Judgement\r\nover them.\" The _Swallow_ returned in a few days to Parrot Island to look\r\nfor Roberts in the _Royal Fortune_. Roberts being at breakfast, enjoying a\r\nsavoury dish of solomongundy, was informed of the approach of the ship,\r\nbut refused to take any notice of it. At last, thoroughly alarmed, he cut\r\nhis cables and sailed out, but most of his crew being drunk, even at this\r\nearly hour, the pirates did not make as good a resistance as if they had\r\nbeen sober. Early in the engagement Roberts was hit in the throat by a\r\ngrape-shot and killed; this being on February 10th, 1722. His body, fully\r\ndressed, with his arms and ornaments, was thrown overboard according to\r\nhis repeated request made during his lifetime. Thus the arch-pirate died,\r\nas he always said he wished to die, fighting. His motto had always been \"A\r\nshort life and a merry one.\" One good word can be said for Roberts, that\r\nhe never forced a man to become a pirate against his wish.\r\n\r\n\r\nROBERTS, OWEN. Welsh pirate.\r\n\r\nCarpenter in the _Queen Ann's Revenge_, and killed on November 22nd, 1718,\r\noff the North Carolina Coast.\r\n\r\n\r\nROBINSON, EDWARD.\r\n\r\nOf Newcastle-upon-Tyne.\r\n\r\nHanged at Charleston, South Carolina, in 1718.\r\n\r\n\r\nROCHE, CAPTAIN PHILIP, _alias_ JOHN EUSTACE.\r\n\r\nIn company with three other mariners--Cullen, Wife, and Neale--this Irish\r\npirate shipped himself on board a French snow at Cork in November, 1721,\r\nfor a passage to Nantes. Owing to Roche's briskness, genteel manners, and\r\nknowledge of navigation, the master used occasionally to place him in\r\ncharge of the vessel. One night a few days out a pre-arranged mutiny took\r\nplace, the French crew being butchered and thrown overboard. The captain,\r\nwho pleaded for mercy, was also thrown into the sea. Driven by bad weather\r\nto Dartmouth, the new captain, Roche, had the ship repainted and\r\ndisguised, and renamed her the _Mary_. Then sailing to Rotterdam he sold\r\nthe cargo of beef and took on a fresh cargo with the owner, Mr. Annesly.\r\nThe first night out of port they threw Mr. Annesly overboard, and he swam\r\nalongside for some while pleading to be taken in. On going into a French\r\nport, and hearing that an enquiry was being made about his ship, Roche ran\r\naway. The crew took the ship to Scotland, and there landed and\r\ndisappeared, and the ship was seized and taken to the Thames.\r\n\r\nLater on Roche was arrested in London and committed to Newgate Prison,\r\nfound guilty of piracy, and hanged on August 5th, 1723, at Execution Dock,\r\nat the age of 30. The hanging was not, from the public spectators point of\r\nview, a complete success, for the culprit \"was so ill at the time that he\r\ncould not make any public declaration of his abhorrence of the crime for\r\nwhich he suffered.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nRODERIGO, PETER.\r\n\r\nA \"Flanderkin.\"\r\n\r\nCommanded a Dutch vessel, the _Edward and Thomas_, that sailed from Boston\r\nin 1674, and took several small English vessels along the coast of Maine.\r\nTried for piracy at Cambridge, Massachusetts, and condemned to be hanged,\r\nbut was afterwards pardoned.\r\n\r\n\r\nROGERS, CAPTAIN THOMAS.\r\n\r\nCommanded a ship, the _Forlorn_. Routed the Spaniards at Venta Cruz in\r\n1671. One of Morgan's captains in his attack on Panama.\r\n\r\n\r\nROGERS, CAPTAIN WOODES.\r\n\r\nAs the life of this famous navigator and privateer is, very justly,\r\ntreated fully in the \"Dictionary of National Biography\" it is unnecessary\r\nto mention more than a few incidents in his adventurous career. Woodes\r\nRogers was not only a good navigator, for on many occasions he showed a\r\nremarkable gift for commanding mutinous crews in spite of having many\r\nofficers on whom he could place little reliance. On leaving Cork in 1708,\r\nafter an incompetent pilot had almost run his ship on two rocks off\r\nKinsale called \"The Sovereigne's Bollacks,\" Rogers describes his crew\r\nthus: \"A third were foreigners, while of Her Majestie's subjects many were\r\ntaylors, tinkers, pedlars, fiddlers, and hay-makers, with ten boys and one\r\nnegro.\" It was with crews such as these that many of the boldest and most\r\nremarkable early voyages were made, and they required a man of Woodes\r\nRogers stamp to knock them into sailors. Rogers had a gift for inspiring\r\nfriendship wherever he went. On arriving at the coast of Brazil, his boat\r\nwas fired on when trying to land at Angre de Reys. This settlement had but\r\nlately received several hostile visitors in the way of French pirates. But\r\nbefore a week was passed Woodes Rogers had so won the hearts of the\r\nPortuguese Governor and the settlers that he and his \"musick\" were invited\r\nto take part in an important religious function, or \"entertainment,\" as\r\nRogers calls it, \"where,\" he says, \"we waited on the Governour, Signior\r\nRaphael de Silva Lagos, in a body, being ten of us, with two trumpets and\r\na hautboy, which he desir'd might play us to church, where our musick did\r\nthe office of an organ, but separate from the singing, which was by the\r\nfathers well perform'd. Our musick played 'Hey, boys, up go we!' and all\r\nmanner of noisy paltry tunes. And after service, our musicians, who were\r\nby that time more than half drunk, march'd at the head of the company;\r\nnext to them an old father and two fryars carrying lamps of incense, then\r\nan image dressed with flowers and wax candles, then about forty priests,\r\nfryars, etc., followed by the Governor of the town, myself, and Capt.\r\nCourtney, with each of us a long wax candle lighted. The ceremony held\r\nabout two hours; after which we were splendidly entertained by the\r\nfathers of the Convent, and then by the Governour. They unanimously told\r\nus they expected nothing from us but our Company, and they had no more but\r\nour musick.\"\r\n\r\nWhat a delightful picture this calls to the mind--the little Brazilian\r\ntown, the tropical foliage, the Holy Procession, \"wax figure\" and priests,\r\nfollowed by the Governor with an English buccaneer on either side, and\r\nheaded by a crew of drunken Protestant English sailors playing \"Hey, boys,\r\nup go we!\"\r\n\r\nRogers, not to be outdone in hospitality, next day entertained the\r\nGovernor and fathers on board the _Duke_, \"when,\" he says, \"they were very\r\nmerry, and in their cups propos'd the Pope's health to us. But we were\r\nquits with 'em by toasting the Archbishop of Canterbury; and to keep up\r\nthe humour, we also proposed William Pen's health, and they liked the\r\nliquor so well, that they refused neither.\" Alas! the good Governor and\r\nthe fathers were not in a fit state to leave the ship when the end came to\r\nthe entertainment, so slept on board, being put ashore in the morning,\r\n\"when we saluted 'em with a huzza from each ship, because,\" as Rogers\r\nsays, \"we were not overstocked with powder.\"\r\n\r\nIt was in March, 1710, that Rogers brought his little fleet into the\r\nharbour of Guam, one of the Ladrone Islands. Although at war with Spain,\r\nthe captain soon became on his usual friendly terms with the Governor of\r\nthis Spanish colony, and gave an entertainment on board his ship to him\r\nand four other Spanish gentlemen, making them \"as welcome as time and\r\nplace would afford, with musick and our sailors dancing.\" The Governor\r\ngave a return party on shore, to which Rogers and all his brother officers\r\nwere invited, partaking of \"sixty dishes of various sorts.\" After this\r\nfeast Rogers gave his host a present, consisting of \"two negro boys\r\ndress'd in liveries.\" One other instance of Woodes Rogers adaptability\r\nmust suffice. In the year 1717 he was appointed Governor to the Bahama\r\nIslands, at New Providence, now called Nassau. His chief duty was to stamp\r\nout the West India pirates who had made this island their headquarters for\r\nmany years, and were in complete power there, and numbered more than 2,000\r\ndesperadoes, including such famous men as Vane and Teach. Rogers's only\r\nweapon, besides the man-of-war he arrived in, was a royal proclamation\r\nfrom King George offering free pardon to all pirates or buccaneers who\r\nwould surrender at once to the new Governor. At first the pirates were\r\ninclined to resist his landing, but in the end the tactful Rogers got his\r\nown way, and not only landed, but was received by an armed guard of\r\nhonour, and passed between two lines of pirates who fired salutes with\r\ntheir muskets.\r\n\r\nMost of the pirates surrendered and received their pardons, but some, who\r\nreverted shortly afterwards to piracy and were captured and brought back\r\nto New Providence, were tried and actually hanged by Rogers's late\r\nbuccaneer subjects.\r\n\r\nWoodes Rogers eventually died in Nassau in the year 1729.\r\n\r\nHe was the author of a delightful book entitled \"A Cruising Voyage Round\r\nthe World, begun in 1708 and finish'd in 1711, by Captain Woodes Rogers,\r\nCommander-in-Chief on this Expedition, with the ships _Duke_ and _Duchess_\r\nof Bristol.\"\r\n\r\nThis was published in London in 1712.\r\n\r\n\r\nROLLSON, PETER.\r\n\r\nCaptain Gow's gunner in the _Revenge_. Hanged at Execution Dock, Wapping,\r\nin June, 1725.\r\n\r\n\r\nROSS, GEORGE, or ROSE.\r\n\r\nOf Glasgow.\r\n\r\nOne of Major Stede Bonnet's crew of the _Royal James_. Was hanged at\r\nCharleston, South Carolina, on November 8th, 1718, and buried in the marsh\r\nbelow low-water mark.\r\n\r\n\r\nROSSOE, FRANCIS.\r\n\r\nIn June, 1717, in company with four other Carolina pirates, was placed on\r\ntrial for his life. Convicted with De Cossey, De Mont, and Ernandos, of\r\npiratically taking the vessels the _Turtle Dove_, the _Penelope_, and the\r\n_Virgin Queen_ in July of the previous year, and, after being sentenced to\r\ndeath by Judge Trott, Rossoe and his fellow-pirates were promptly\r\nexecuted.\r\n\r\n\r\nROUNDSIVEL, CAPTAIN GEORGE.\r\n\r\nOf the Bahama Islands.\r\n\r\nHe refused to avail himself of King George's pardon to all pirates in\r\n1717, and went off again on the \"main chance\" till captured.\r\n\r\n\r\nROW, CAPTAIN. Buccaneer.\r\n\r\nIn 1679, at the Boca del Toro, was with the buccaneer fleet that attacked\r\nand sacked Santa Maria. Row commanded a small vessel of twenty tons, a\r\ncrew of twenty-five men, and no guns.\r\n\r\n\r\nRUIZ.\r\n\r\nOne of Captain Gilbert's crew in the pirate schooner _Panda_, which\r\nplundered the Salem brig _Mexican_ in 1834. Tried in Boston and condemned\r\nto be hanged. Pleading insanity, he was respited for sixty days and then\r\nhanged on September 12th, 1835.\r\n\r\n\r\nRUPERT. Prince of the Rhine.\r\n\r\nAfter an adventurous life as a soldier on the Continent, he sailed from\r\nIreland in 1648 with seven ships. His own ship was the _Swallow_. He was a\r\nman of boundless energy, who was never happy if not engaged in some\r\nenterprise, and as legitimate warfare gave him few opportunities he turned\r\npirate. He spent five years at sea, largely in the West Indies, meeting\r\nwith every kind of adventure.\r\n\r\nIn 1653 he was caught in a storm in the Virgin Islands, and his fleet was\r\nwrecked. His brother, Prince Maurice, was lost with his ship, the\r\n_Defiance_, the only ship saved being the _Swallow_. Prince Rupert\r\nreturned in the _Swallow_ to France in the same year. Hitherto the prince\r\nhad been a restless, clever man, \"very sparkish in his dress,\" but this\r\ncatastrophe to his fleet and the loss of his brother broke his spirit, and\r\nhe retired to England, where he died in his bed in 1682 at Spring Gardens.\r\n\r\n\r\nLE SAGE, CAPTAIN. French filibuster.\r\n\r\nIn 1684 was at San Domingo, in command of the _Tigre_, carrying thirty\r\nguns and a crew of 130 men.\r\n\r\n\r\nSALTER, EDWARD.\r\n\r\nHanged in Virginia in 1718 with the rest of Captain Teach's crew.\r\n\r\n\r\nSAMPLE, CAPTAIN RICHARD. Buccaneer.\r\n\r\nWas at New Providence Island in 1718, and received the royal pardon from\r\nKing George, offered to those pirates who surrendered themselves to\r\nGovernor Woodes Rogers. Like many another, he fell again into his former\r\nwicked ways, and ended his life by being hanged.\r\n\r\n\r\nSAMPLE, CAPTAIN ROBERT.\r\n\r\nOne of England's crew in the _Royal James_. In 1720 they took a prize, the\r\n_Elizabeth and Katherine_, off the coast of West Africa. Fitting her out\r\nfor a pirate, they named her the _Flying King_, and Sample was put in\r\ncommand. In company with Captain Low, he sailed to Brazil and did much\r\nmischief amongst the Portuguese shipping. In November of the same year the\r\ntwo pirate ships were attacked by a very powerful man-of-war. Lane got\r\naway, but Sample was compelled to run his ship ashore on the coast. Of his\r\ncrew of seventy men, twelve were killed and the rest taken prisoners, of\r\nwhom the Portuguese hanged thirty-eight. Of these, thirty-two were\r\nEnglish, three Dutch, two French, and one Portuguese.\r\n\r\n\r\nSANDERS, THOMAS.\r\n\r\nAn Elizabethan mariner who was taken prisoner by the Moors. He wrote a\r\nnarrative of his life as a slave on a Barbary pirate galley.\r\n\r\n\"I and sixe more of my fellowes,\" he wrote, \"together with four-score\r\nItalians and Spaniards, were sent foorth in a Galeot to take a Greekish\r\nCarmosell, which came into Africa to steale Negroes. We were chained three\r\nand three to an oare, and we rowed naked above the girdle, and the\r\nBoteswaine of the Galley walked abaft the masts, and his Mate afore the\r\nmaste ... and when their develish choller rose, they would strike the\r\nChristians for no cause. And they allowed us but halfe a pound of bread a\r\nman in a day without any other kind of sustenance, water excepted.... We\r\nwere then so cruelly manackled in such sort, that we could not put our\r\nhands the length of one foote asunder the one from the other, and every\r\nnight they searched our chains three times, to see if they were fast\r\nriveted.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nSAWKINS, CAPTAIN RICHARD. Buccaneer.\r\n\r\nWe know little of the early career of this remarkable buccaneer. He was\r\nloved by his crew, and had great influence over them. It is recorded that\r\none Sunday morning, finding some of his men gambling, he threw the dice\r\noverboard, saying \"he would have no gambling aboard his ship.\"\r\n\r\nWe know that on one occasion he was caught in his vessel by H.M.S.\r\n_Success_ and brought to Port Royal, Jamaica, and that on December 1st,\r\n1679, he was in prison awaiting trial for piracy. Apparently he got off,\r\nfor this brilliant young buccaneer is soon afterwards heard of as\r\ncommanding a small vessel of sixteen tons, armed with but one gun and a\r\ncrew of thirty-five men. He was one of a party of 330 buccaneers who,\r\nunder the leadership of Coxon and Sharp, landed on the coast of Darien and\r\nmarched through the jungle to attack and plunder the town of Santa Maria.\r\nThe remainder of the journey across the isthmus was done in canoes, in\r\nwhich the pirates travelled down the Santa Maria River until they found\r\nthemselves in the Pacific. On this expedition each captain had his company\r\nand had his own colours, Sawkins's flag being a red one with yellow\r\nstripes. Arrived at the sea, they captured two small Spanish vessels, and,\r\nthe rest of the company being in the canoes, they boldly sailed towards\r\nPanama City. Meeting with the Spanish fleet of eight ships, the buccaneers\r\nattacked it, and, after a most furious battle, came off victorious. This\r\nwas one of the most gallant episodes in the whole history of the \"brethren\r\nof the coast,\" and was afterwards known as the Battle of Perico. Sawkins\r\nfought in the most brave and desperate manner, and took a large share in\r\nthe successful enterprise. After this action some quarrelling took place,\r\nwhich ended by Captain Coxon going off with some seventy men, to return\r\nacross the isthmus on foot. The company that remained in the Pacific\r\nelected Sawkins to be their leader, as Captain Sharp, a much older man,\r\nwas away in his ship.\r\n\r\nThe buccaneers, ever since they defeated the Spanish fleet, had blockaded\r\nthe harbour, and a correspondence took place between the Governor of\r\nPanama and Sawkins, the former wishing to know what the pirates had come\r\nthere for. To this message Sawkins sent back answer \"that we came to\r\nassist the King of Darien, who was the true Lord of Panama and all the\r\ncountry thereabouts. And that since we were come so far, there was no\r\nreason but that we should have some satisfaction. So that if he pleased to\r\nsend us five hundred pieces of eight for each man, and one thousand for\r\neach commander, and not any farther to annoy the Indians, but suffer them\r\nto use their own power and liberty, as became the true and natural lords\r\nof the country, that then we would desist from all further hostilities,\r\nand go away peaceably; otherwise that we should stay there, and get what\r\nwe could, causing to them what damage was possible.\"\r\n\r\nThis message was just bluff on Sawkins's part, but having heard that the\r\nBishop of Santa Martha was in the city, Sawkins sent him two loaves of\r\nsugar as a present, and reminded the prelate that he had been his prisoner\r\nfive years before, when Sawkins took that town. Further messengers\r\nreturned from Panama next day, bringing a gold ring for Sawkins from the\r\nwell-disposed Bishop, and a message from the Governor, in which he\r\ninquired \"from whom we had our commission and to whom he ought to complain\r\nfor the damage we had already done them?\" To this Sawkins sent back answer\r\n\"that as yet all his company were not come together; but that when they\r\nwere come up we would come and visit him at Panama, and bring our\r\ncommissions on the muzzles of our guns, at which time he should read them\r\nas plain as the flame of gunpowder could make them.\"\r\n\r\nAfter lying off Panama for some while without meeting with any plunder,\r\nand their victuals running short, the crews began to grumble, and\r\npersuaded Sawkins to sail south along the coast. This he did, and,\r\narriving off the town of Puebla Nueva on May 22nd, 1679, Sawkins landed a\r\nparty of sixty men and led them against the town. But the Spaniards had\r\nbeen warned in time, and had built up three strong breastworks.\r\n\r\nSawkins, who never knew what fear meant, stormed the town at the head of\r\nhis men, but was killed by a musket-ball.\r\n\r\nBasil Ringrose, the buccaneer who wrote the narrative of this voyage,\r\ndescribes Sawkins as being \"a man who was as valiant and courageous as any\r\nman could be, and the best beloved of all our company\"; and on another\r\noccasion he speaks of him as \"a man whom nothing on earth could terrifie.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nSAWNEY, CAPTAIN.\r\n\r\nA pirate of New Providence Island in the Bahamas. In this pirate republic\r\nthis old man lived in the best hut, and was playfully known as \"Governor\r\nSawney.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nDE SAYAS, FRANCISCO.\r\n\r\nA Spanish pirate hanged at Kingston, Jamaica, in 1823.\r\n\r\n\r\nSCOT, LEWIS.\r\n\r\nDistinguished as being the first pirate to carry on the trade on land as\r\nwell as at sea. Before this time pirates were never known to be anything\r\nbut harmless drunkards when on shore, whatever they might be on board\r\ntheir ships. Scot changed all this when he sacked and pillaged the city of\r\nCampeachy. So successful was he that his example was quickly followed by\r\nMansfield, John Davis, and other pirates.\r\n\r\n\r\nSCOT, ROGER.\r\n\r\nBorn at Bristol.\r\n\r\nOne of Captain Roberts's crew. Tried for piracy in April, 1722, at Cape\r\nCoast Castle, West Africa, after the great defeat of the pirates by H.M.S.\r\n_Swallow_. On this occasion no less than 267 pirates were accounted for.\r\nThe finding of the Honourable the President and Judges of the Court of\r\nAdmiralty for trying of pirates was as follows:\r\n\r\n  Acquitted                                 74\r\n  Executed                                  52\r\n  Respited                                   2\r\n  To Servitude                              20\r\n  To the Marshallsea                        17 for tryal\r\n\r\nThe rest were accounted for as follows:\r\n\r\n  Killed { In the _Ranger_                  10\r\n         { In the _Fortune_                  3\r\n    Dy'd { In the passage to Cape Corso     15\r\n         { Afterwards in the castle          4\r\n  Negroes in both ships                     70\r\n                                          ----\r\n                                           267\r\n                                          ----\r\n\r\nA number of the prisoners signed a \"humble petition\" begging that, as\r\nthey, being \"unhappily and unwisely drawn into that wretched and\r\ndetestable Crime of Piracy,\" they might be permitted to serve in the Royal\r\nAfrican Company in the country for seven years, in remission of their\r\ncrimes. This clemency was granted to twenty of the prisoners, of which\r\nScot was one.\r\n\r\nA very impressive indenture was drawn up, according to which the prisoners\r\nwere to become the slaves of the Company for seven years, and this was\r\nsigned by the prisoners and by the President.\r\n\r\n\r\nSCOTT, WILLIAM.\r\n\r\nOne of Major Stede Bonnet's crew in the _Royal James_. Tried for piracy in\r\n1718 at Charleston, South Carolina, and hanged at White Point on November\r\n8th.\r\n\r\n\r\nSCUDAMORE, CHRISTOPHER.\r\n\r\nOne of Captain John Quelch's crew. Tried for piracy at the Star Tavern in\r\nHanover Street, Boston, in 1704, and hanged on Charles River, Boston Side,\r\non June 30th. A report of the trial and execution of these pirates,\r\ndescribing Scudamore's conduct on the gallows, says: \"He appeared very\r\nPenitent since his Condemnation, was very diligent to improve his time\r\ngoing to, and at the place of Execution.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nSCUDAMORE, PETER.\r\n\r\nBelonging to Bristol.\r\n\r\nSurgeon in the _Mercy_ galley, and taken by Captain Roberts in 1721. It\r\nwas a rule on all pirate vessels for the surgeon to be excused from\r\nsigning the ship's articles. When the next prize was taken, if she carried\r\na surgeon, he was taken in place of their present one, if the latter\r\nwished to leave. But when Scudamore came on board the _Royal Fortune_ he\r\ninsisted on signing the pirate articles and boasted that he was the first\r\nsurgeon that had ever done so, and he hoped, he said, to prove as great a\r\nrogue as any of them.\r\n\r\nWhen the African Company's Guinea ship, the _King Solomon_, was taken,\r\nScudamore came aboard and helped himself to their surgeon's instruments\r\nand medicines. He also took a fancy for a backgammon board, but only kept\r\nit after a violent quarrel with another pirate. It came out at his trial\r\nthat on a voyage from the Island of St. Thomas, in a prize, the _Fortune_,\r\nin which was a cargo of slaves, Scudamore had tried to bring about a\r\nmutiny of the blacks to kill the prize crew which was on board, and he was\r\ndetected in the night going about amongst the negroes, talking to them in\r\nthe Angolan language. He said that he knew enough about navigation to sail\r\nthe ship himself, and he was heard to say that \"this were better than to\r\nbe taken to Cape Corso to be hanged and sun dried.\"\r\n\r\nThe same witness told how he had approached the prisoner when he was\r\ntrying to persuade a wounded pirate, one James Harris, to join him in his\r\nscheme, but fearing to be overheard, Scudamore turned the conversation to\r\nhorse-racing.\r\n\r\nScudamore was condemned to death, but allowed three days' grace before\r\nbeing hanged, which he spent in incessant prayers and reading of the\r\nScriptures. On the gallows he sang, solo, the Thirty-first Psalm. Died at\r\nthe age of 35.\r\n\r\n\r\nSEARLES, CAPTAIN ROBERT.\r\n\r\nIn 1664 he brought in two Spanish prizes to Port Royal, but as orders had\r\nonly lately come from England to the Governor to do all in his power to\r\npromote friendly relations with the Spanish islands, these prizes were\r\nreturned to their owners. To prevent Searle's doing such things again, he\r\nwas deprived of his ship's rudder and sails. In 1666, Searle, in company\r\nwith a Captain Stedman and a party of only eighty men, took the Island of\r\nTobago, near Trinidad, from the Dutch, destroying everything they could\r\nnot carry away.\r\n\r\n\r\nSELKIRK, ALEXANDER. The original Robinson Crusoe.\r\n\r\nBorn in 1676 at Largo in Fifeshire, he was the seventh son of John\r\nSelcraig, a shoemaker. In 1695 he was cited to appear before the Session\r\nfor \"indecent conduct in church,\" but ran away to sea. In 1701 he was back\r\nagain in Largo, and was rebuked in the face of the congregation for\r\nquarrelling with his brothers. A year later Selkirk sailed to England, and\r\nin 1703 joined Dampier's expedition to the South Seas. Appointed\r\nsailing-master to the _Cinque Ports_, commanded by Captain Stradling.\r\n\r\nIn September, 1704, he arrived at the uninhabited island of Juan\r\nFernandez, in the South Pacific. Selkirk, having quarrelled with the\r\ncaptain, insisted on being landed on the island with all his belongings.\r\nHe lived alone here for nearly four years, building himself two cabins,\r\nhunting the goats which abounded, and taming young goats and cats to be\r\nhis companions.\r\n\r\nOn the night of January 31st, 1709, seeing two ships, Selkirk lit a fire,\r\nand a boat was sent ashore. These ships were the _Duke_ and _Duchess_ of\r\nBristol, under the command of Captain Woodes Rogers, while his old friend\r\nDampier was acting as pilot. Selkirk was at once appointed sailing-master\r\nof the _Duchess_, and eventually arrived back in the Thames on October\r\n14th, 1711, with booty worth £800, having been away from England for eight\r\nyears. While in England he met Steele, who described Selkirk as a \"man of\r\ngood sense, with strong but cheerful expression.\" Whether Selkirk ever met\r\nDefoe is uncertain, though the character of Robinson Crusoe was certainly\r\nfounded on his adventures in Juan Fernandez. In 1712 he returned to Largo,\r\nliving the life of a recluse, and we must be forgiven for suspecting that\r\nhe rather acted up to the part, since it is recorded that he made a cave\r\nin his father's garden in which to meditate. This life of meditation in an\r\nartificial cave was soon rudely interrupted by the appearance of a certain\r\nMiss Sophia Bonce, with whom Selkirk fell violently in love, and they\r\neloped together to Bristol, which must have proved indeed a sad scandal to\r\nthe elders and other godly citizens of Largo. Beyond the fact that he was\r\ncharged at Bristol with assaulting one Richard Nettle, a shipwright, we\r\nhear no more of Selkirk until his first will was drawn up in 1717, in\r\nwhich he leaves his fortune and house to \"my loving friend Sophia Bonce,\r\nof the Pall Mall, London, Spinster.\" Shortly after this, Alexander basely\r\ndeserted his loving friend and married a widow, one Mrs. Francis Candis,\r\nat Oarston in Devon.\r\n\r\nIn 1720 he was appointed mate to H.M.S. _Weymouth_, on board of which he\r\ndied a year later at the age of 45.\r\n\r\nSelkirk is immortalized in literature, not only by Defoe, but by Cowper in\r\nhis \"Lines on Solitude,\" beginning: \"I am monarch of all I survey.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nSHARP, ROWLAND.\r\n\r\nOf Bath Town in North Carolina.\r\n\r\nOne of Major Stede Bonnet's crew. Tried for piracy at Charleston in 1718\r\nand found \"not guilty.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nSHASTER, ROGER.\r\n\r\nOne of Captain Heidon's crew of the pirate ship _John of Sandwich_, which\r\nwas wrecked on the coast of Alderney. Shaster was arrested and hanged at\r\nSt. Martin's Point, Guernsey, in 1564.\r\n\r\n\r\nSHAW, JOHN.\r\n\r\nOne of Captain Lowther's crew. Hanged at St. Kitts on March 11th, 1722.\r\n\r\n\r\nSHERGALL, HENRY, or SHERRAL. Buccaneer.\r\n\r\nA seaman with Captain Bartholomew Sharp in his South Sea voyage. One\r\nOctober day he fell into the sea while going into the spritsail-top and\r\nwas drowned. \"This incident several of our company interpreted as a bad\r\nomen, which proved not so, through the providence of the Almighty.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nSHIRLEY, SIR ANTHONY.\r\n\r\nIn January, 1597, headed an expedition to the Island of Jamaica. He met\r\nwith little opposition from the Spaniards, and seized and plundered St.\r\nJago de la Vega.\r\n\r\n\r\nSHIVERS, CAPTAIN.\r\n\r\nThis South Sea pirate cruised in company with Culliford and Nathaniel\r\nNorth in the Red Sea, preying principally on Moorish ships, and also\r\nsailed about the Indian Ocean as far as the Malacca Islands. He accepted\r\nthe royal pardon to pirates, which was brought out to Madagascar by\r\nCommodore Littleton, and apparently gave up his wicked ways thereafter.\r\n\r\n\r\nSHUTFIELD, WILLIAM.\r\n\r\nOf Lancaster.\r\n\r\nHanged at Rhode Island in July, 1723, at the age of 40.\r\n\r\n\r\nSICCADAM, JOHN.\r\n\r\nOf Boston.\r\n\r\nOne of Captain Pound's crew. Found guilty of piracy, but pardoned.\r\n\r\n\r\nSIMMS, HENRY, _alias_ \"GENTLEMAN HARRY.\" Pickpocket, highwayman, pirate,\r\nand Old Etonian.\r\n\r\nBorn in 1716 at St. Martin's-in-the-Fields. Sent while quite young to\r\nschool at Eton, where he \"shewed an early inclination to vice,\" and at the\r\nage of 14 was taken from school and apprenticed to a breeches-maker. No\r\nOld Etonian, either then or now, would stand that kind of treatment, so\r\nSimms ran away, becoming a pickpocket and later a highwayman. After\r\nnumerous adventures and escapes from prison, he was pressed on board\r\nH.M.S. _Rye_, but he deserted his ship at Leith. After an \"affair\" at\r\nCroydon, Simms was transplanted with other convicts to Maryland, in the\r\n_Italian Merchant_. On the voyage he attempted, but without success, to\r\nraise a mutiny. On his arrival in America he was sold to the master of the\r\n_Two Sisters_, which was taken a few days out from Maryland by a Bayonne\r\npirate. Carried to Spain, Simms got to Oporto, and there was pressed on\r\nboard H.M.S. _King Fisher_. Eventually he reached Bristol, where he\r\nbought, with his share of booty, a horse and two pistols, with which to go\r\non the highway.\r\n\r\nHanged on June 17th, 1747, for stealing an old silver watch and 5s. from\r\nMr. Francis Sleep at Dunstable.\r\n\r\n\r\nSKIPTON, CAPTAIN.\r\n\r\nCommanded a pirate ship, in which he sailed in company with Captain\r\nSpriggs. Being chased by H.M.S. _Diamond_ off the coast of Cuba, Skipton\r\nran his sloop on to the Florida Reef. Escaping with his crew to an island,\r\nthey were attacked by the Indians, and many of them were captured and\r\neaten. The survivors, embarking in a canoe, were caught by the man-of-war\r\nand taken prisoner.\r\n\r\n\r\nSKYRM, CAPTAIN JAMES. Welsh pirate.\r\n\r\nHanged at the advanced age--for a pirate--of 44.\r\n\r\nCommanded the _Ranger_, one of Captain Roberts's ships that cruised in\r\n1721 and 1722 off the West Coast of Africa. In the fight with the King's\r\nship that took him he was very active with a drawn sword in his hand, with\r\nwhich he beat any of his crew who were at all backward. One of his legs\r\nwas shot away in this action, but he refused to leave the deck and go\r\nbelow as long as the action lasted. He was condemned to death and hanged\r\nin chains.\r\n\r\n\r\nSMITH, GEORGE. Welsh pirate.\r\n\r\nOne of Captain Roberts's pirates. Hanged at the age of 25.\r\n\r\n\r\nSMITH, JOHN.\r\n\r\nOne of the mutinous crew of the _Antonio_. Hanged at Boston in 1672.\r\n\r\n\r\nSMITH, JOHN WILLIAMS.\r\n\r\nOf Charleston, Carolina.\r\n\r\nHanged in 1718 for piracy, at Charleston.\r\n\r\n\r\nSMITH, MAJOR SAMUEL. Buccaneer.\r\n\r\nAt one time a buccaneer with the famous Mansfield.\r\n\r\nIn 1641 he was sent, by the Governor of Jamaica, with a party to reinforce\r\nthe troops which under Mansfield had recaptured the New Providence Island\r\nfrom the Spanish. In 1660 he was taken prisoner by the Spanish and carried\r\nto Panama and there kept in chains in a dungeon for seventeen months.\r\n\r\n\r\nDE SOTO, BERNADO.\r\n\r\nOne of the crew of the schooner _Panda_ that took and plundered the Salem\r\nbrig _Mexican_. The crew of the _Panda_ were captured by an English\r\nman-of-war and taken to Boston. De Soto was condemned to death, but\r\neventually fully pardoned owing to his heroic conduct in rescuing the crew\r\nof an American vessel some time previously.\r\n\r\n\r\nDE SOTO, CAPTAIN BENITO.\r\n\r\nA Portuguese.\r\n\r\nA most notorious pirate in and about 1830.\r\n\r\nIn 1827 he shipped at Buenos Ayres as mate in a slaver, named the\r\n_Defenser de Pedro_, and plotted to seize the ship off the African coast.\r\nThe pirates took the cargo of slaves to the West Indies, where they sold\r\nthem. De Soto plundered many vessels in the Caribbean Sea, then sailed to\r\nthe South Atlantic, naming his ship the _Black Joke_. The fear of the\r\n_Black Joke_ became so great amongst the East Indiamen homeward bound that\r\nthey used to make up convoys at St. Helena before heading north.\r\n\r\nIn 1832 de Soto attacked the _Morning Star_, an East Indiaman, and took\r\nher, when he plundered the ship and murdered the captain. After taking\r\nseveral more ships, de Soto lost his own on the rocky coast of Spain, near\r\nCadiz. His crew, although pretending to be honest shipwrecked sailors,\r\nwere arrested, but de Soto managed to escape to Gibraltar. Here he was\r\nrecognized by a soldier who had seen de Soto when he took the _Morning\r\nStar_, in which he had been a passenger. The pirate was arrested, and\r\ntried before Sir George Don, the Governor of Gibraltar, and sentenced to\r\ndeath. He was sent to Cadiz to be hanged with the rest of his crew. The\r\ngallows was erected at the water's edge, and de Soto, with his coffin, was\r\nconveyed there in a cart. He died bravely, arranging the noose around his\r\nown neck, stepping up into his coffin to do so; then, crying out, \"Adios\r\ntodos,\" he threw himself off the cart.\r\n\r\nThis man must not be confused with one Bernado de Soto, who was tried for\r\npiracy at Boston in 1834.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOUND, JOSEPH.\r\n\r\nOf the city of Westminster.\r\n\r\nHanged, at the age of 28, at Newport, Rhode Island, in 1723.\r\n\r\n\r\nSPARKS, JAMES.\r\n\r\nA Newfoundland fisherman.\r\n\r\nIn August, 1723, with John Phillips and three others, ran away with a\r\nvessel to go \"on the account.\" Sparks was appointed gunner.\r\n\r\n\r\nSPARKES, JOHN.\r\n\r\nA member of Captain Avery's crew, and described by one of his shipmates as\r\nbeing \"a true cock of the game.\" A thief, he robbed his fellow-shipmates,\r\nand from one, Philip Middleton, he stole 270 pieces of gold.\r\n\r\nHanged at Execution Dock in 1696.\r\n\r\n\r\nSPRATLIN, ROBERT.\r\n\r\nWas one of Dampier's party which in 1681 crossed the Isthmus of Darien,\r\nwhen he was left behind in the jungle with Wafer. Spratlin was lost when\r\nthe little party attempted to ford the swollen Chagres River. He\r\nafterwards rejoined Wafer.\r\n\r\n\r\nSPRIGGS, CAPTAIN FRANCIS FARRINGTON.\r\n\r\nAn uninteresting and bloody pirate without one single redeeming character.\r\n\r\nHe learnt his art with the pirate Captain Lowther, afterwards serving as\r\nquartermaster with Captain Low and taking an active part in all the\r\nbarbarities committed by the latter.\r\n\r\nAbout 1720 Low took a prize, a man-of-war called the _Squirrel_. This he\r\nhanded over to some of the crew, who elected Spriggs their captain. The\r\nship they renamed the _Delight_, and in the night altered their course and\r\nleft Low. They made a flag, bearing upon it a white skeleton, holding in\r\none hand a dart striking a bleeding heart, and in the other an hourglass.\r\nSailing to the West Indies, Spriggs took several prizes, treating the\r\ncrews with abominable cruelty. On one occasion the pirates chased what\r\nthey believed to be a Spanish ship, and after a long while they came\r\nalongside and fired a broadside into her. The ship immediately\r\nsurrendered, and turned out to be a vessel the pirate had plundered only a\r\nfew days previously. This infuriated Spriggs and his crew, who showed\r\ntheir disappointment by half murdering the captain. After a narrow escape\r\nfrom being captured by a French man-of-war near the Island of St. Kitts,\r\nSpriggs sailed north to the Summer Isles, or Bermudas. Taking a ship\r\ncoming from Rhode Island, they found her cargo to consist of horses.\r\nSeveral of the pirates mounted these and galloped up and down the deck\r\nuntil they were thrown. While plundering several small vessels of their\r\ncargo of logwood in the Bay of Honduras, Spriggs was surprised and\r\nattacked by an English man-of-war, and the pirates only escaped by using\r\ntheir sweeps. Spriggs now went for a cruise off the coast of South\r\nCarolina, returning again to Honduras. This was a rash proceeding on\r\nSpriggs's part, for as he was sailing off the west end of Cuba he again\r\nmet the man-of-war which had so nearly caught him before in the bay.\r\nSpriggs clapped on all sail, but ran his ship on Rattan Island, where she\r\nwas burnt by the _Spence_, while Captain Spriggs and his crew escaped to\r\nthe woods.\r\n\r\n\r\nSPRINGER, CAPTAIN.\r\n\r\nHe fought gallantly with Sawkins and Ringrose in the Battle of Perico off\r\nPanama on St. George's Day in 1680. He gave his name to Springer's Cay,\r\none of the Samballoes Islands. This was the rendezvous chosen by the\r\npirates, where Dampier and his party found the French pirate ship that\r\nrescued them after their famous trudge across the Isthmus of Darien.\r\n\r\n\r\nSTANLEY, CAPTAIN. Buccaneer.\r\n\r\nWith a few other buccaneers in their stronghold at New Providence Island\r\nin 1660, withstood an attack by a Spanish fleet for five days. The three\r\nEnglish captains, Stanley, Sir Thomas Whetstone, and Major Smith, were\r\ncarried to Panama and there cast into a dungeon and bound in irons for\r\nseventeen months.\r\n\r\n\r\nSTEDMAN, CAPTAIN. Buccaneer.\r\n\r\nIn 1666, with Captain Searle and a party of only eighty men, he took and\r\nplundered the Dutch island of Tobago. Later on, after the outbreak of war\r\nwith France, he was captured by a French frigate off the Island of\r\nGuadeloupe. Stedman had a small vessel and a crew of only 100 men, and\r\nfound himself becalmed and unable to escape, so he boldly boarded the\r\nFrenchman and fought for two hours, being finally overcome.\r\n\r\n\r\nSTEPHENS, WILLIAM.\r\n\r\nDied on January 14th, 1682, on board of Captain Sharp's ship a few days\r\nbefore their return to the Barbadoes from the South Seas. His death was\r\nsupposed to have been caused by indulging too freely in mancanilla while\r\nashore at Golfo Dulce. \"Next morning we threw overboard our dead man and\r\ngave him two French vollies and one English one.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nSTEPHENSON, JOHN.\r\n\r\nSailed as an honest seaman in the _Onslow_ (Captain Gee) from Sestos.\r\nTaken in May, 1721, by the pirate Captain Roberts, he willingly joined the\r\npirates. When Roberts was killed on board the _Royal Fortune_, Stephenson\r\nburst into tears, and declared that he wished the next shot might kill\r\nhim. Hanged in 1722.\r\n\r\n\r\nSTILES, RICHARD.\r\n\r\nHanged in Virginia in 1718 with the rest of Captain Teach's crew.\r\n\r\n\r\nSTOREY, THOMAS.\r\n\r\nOne of William Coward's crew which stole the ketch _Elinor_ in Boston\r\nHarbour. Condemned to be hanged on January 27th, 1690, but afterwards\r\nreprieved.\r\n\r\n\r\nST. QUINTIN, RICHARD.\r\n\r\nA native of Yorkshire.\r\n\r\nOne of M'Kinlie's crew that murdered Captain Glass and his family in the\r\nCanary ship. Afterwards arrested at Cork and hanged in chains near Dublin\r\non March 19th, 1765.\r\n\r\n\r\nSTURGES, CAPTAIN.\r\n\r\nAn Elizabethan pirate, who had his headquarters at Rochelle. In company\r\nwith the notorious pirate Calles, he in one year pillaged two Portuguese,\r\none French, one Spanish, and also a Scotch ship. His end is not known.\r\n\r\n\r\nO'SULLIVAN, LORD. Receiver of pirate plunder.\r\n\r\nThe Sulivan Bere, of Berehaven in Ireland.\r\n\r\nA notorious friend of the English pirates, he bought their spoils, which\r\nhe stored in his castle. He helped to fit out pirate captains for their\r\ncruises, and protected them when Queen Elizabeth sent ships to try and\r\narrest them.\r\n\r\n\r\nSUTTON, THOMAS.\r\n\r\nBorn at Berwick in 1699.\r\n\r\nGunner in Roberts's ship the _Royal Fortune_. At his trial he was proved\r\nto have been particularly active in helping to take a Dutch merchantman,\r\nthe _Gertruycht_. Hanged in chains at Cape Coast Castle in April, 1722, at\r\nthe age of 23.\r\n\r\n\r\nSWAN, CAPTAIN.\r\n\r\nCommanded the _Nicholas_, and met Dampier when in the _Batchelor's\r\nDelight_ at the Island of Juan Fernandez in 1684. The two captains cruised\r\ntogether off the west coast of South America, the _Nicholas_ leaving\r\nDampier, who returned to England by way of the East Indies.\r\n\r\n\r\nSWAN, CAPTAIN. Buccaneer.\r\n\r\nOf the _Cygnet_. Left England as an honest trader. Rounded the Horn and\r\nsailed up to the Bay of Nicoya, there taking on a crew of buccaneers who\r\nhad crossed the Isthmus of Darien on foot. Dampier was appointed pilot or\r\nquartermaster to the _Cygnet_, a post analogous to that of a navigating\r\nofficer on a modern man-of-war, while Ringrose was appointed supercargo.\r\nSwan had an adventurous and chequered voyage, sometimes meeting with\r\nsuccesses, but often with reverses. Eventually he sailed to the Philippine\r\nIslands, where the crew mutinied and left Swan and thirty-six of the crew\r\nbehind. After various adventures the _Cygnet_, by now in a very crazy\r\nstate, just managed to reach Madagascar, where she sank at her anchorage.\r\n\r\n\r\nSWITZER, JOSEPH.\r\n\r\nOf Boston in New England.\r\n\r\nTried for piracy at Rhode Island in 1723, but found to be \"not guilty.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nSYMPSON, DAVID.\r\n\r\nBorn at North Berwick.\r\n\r\nOne of Roberts's crew. Tried and hanged at Cape Coast Castle in 1722. On\r\nthe day of execution Sympson was among the first six prisoners to be\r\nbrought up from the ship's hold to have their fetters knocked off and to\r\nbe fitted with halters, and it was observed that none of the culprits\r\nappeared in the least dejected, except Sympson, who \"spoke a little faint,\r\nbut this was rather imputed to a Flux that had seized him two or three\r\ndays before, than Fear.\" There being no clergyman in the colony, a kindly\r\nsurgeon tried to take on the duties of the ordinary, but with ill-success,\r\nthe hardened ruffians being quite unmoved by his attempts at exhortation.\r\nIn fact, the spectators were considerably shocked, as indeed they well\r\nmight be, by Sympson, suddenly recognizing among the crowd a woman whom he\r\nknew, calling out \"he had lain with that B----h three times, and now she\r\nwas come to see him hanged.\"\r\n\r\nSympson died at the age of 36, which was considerably above the average\r\nage to which a pirate might expect to live.\r\n\r\n\r\nTAYLOR, CAPTAIN.\r\n\r\nThis formidable South Sea pirate must indeed have looked, as well as\r\nacted, the part, since his appearance is described by Captain Johnson as\r\nfollows: \"A Fellow with a terrible pair of Whiskers, and a wooden Leg,\r\nbeing stuck round with Pistols, like the Man in the Almanack with Darts.\"\r\n\r\nThis man Taylor it was who stirred up the crew of the _Victory_ to turn\r\nout and maroon Captain England, and elect himself in his place. He was a\r\nvillain of the deepest dye, and burnt ships and houses and tortured his\r\nprisoners.\r\n\r\nThe pirates sailed down the West Coast of India from Goa to Cochin, and\r\nreturned to Mauritius. Thence sailing to the Island of Mascarine they\r\nfound a big Portuguese ship, which they took. In her they discovered the\r\nConde de Eviceira, Viceroy of Goa, and, even better, four million dollars\r\nworth of diamonds.\r\n\r\nTaylor, now sailing in the _Cassandra_, heard that there were four\r\nmen-of-war on his tracks, so he sailed to Delagoa Bay and spent the\r\nwinter of the year 1722 there. It was now decided that as they had a huge\r\namount of plunder they had better give up piracy, so they sailed away to\r\nthe West Indies and surrendered themselves to the Governor of Porto Bello.\r\nThe crew broke up and each man, with a bag of diamonds, went whither he\r\nwould; but Captain Taylor joined the Spanish service, and was put in\r\ncommand of a man-of-war, which was sent to attack the English logwood\r\ncutters in the Bay of Honduras.\r\n\r\n\r\nTAYLOR, WILLIAM.\r\n\r\nOne of Captain Phillips's crew. Wounded in the leg while attempting to\r\ndesert. There being no surgeon on board, a consultation was held over the\r\npatient by the whole crew, and these learned men were unanimous in\r\nagreeing that the leg should be amputated. Some dispute then arose as to\r\nwho should act the part of surgeon, and at length the carpenter was chosen\r\nas the most proper person. \"Upon which he fetch'd up the biggest saw, and\r\ntaking the limb under his Arm, fell to Work, and separated it from the\r\nBody of the Patient in as little Time as he could have cut a Deal Board in\r\ntwo.\" This surgeon-carpenter evidently appreciated the importance of\r\naseptics, for, \"after that he had heated his Ax red hot in the Fire,\r\ncauteriz'd the Wound but not with so much Art as he perform'd the other\r\nPart for he so burnt the Flesh distant from the Place of Amputation that\r\nit had like to have mortify'd.\" Taylor was tried and condemned to death at\r\nBoston on May 12th, 1714, but for some reason not explained was reprieved.\r\n\r\n\r\nTEACH, CAPTAIN EDWARD, or THATCH, or THACH, _alias_ DRUMMOND, _alias_\r\nBLACKBEARD. Arch-pirate.\r\n\r\nA Bristol man who settled in Jamaica, sailing in privateers, but not in\r\nthe capacity of an officer.\r\n\r\nIn 1716, Teach took to piracy, being put in command of a sloop by the\r\npirate Benjamin Hornigold. In 1717, Hornigold and Teach sailed together\r\nfrom Providence towards the American coast, taking a billop from Havana\r\nand several other prizes. After careening their vessels on the coast of\r\nVirginia, the pirates took a fine French Guineaman bound to Martinico;\r\nthis ship they armed with forty guns, named her the _Queen Ann's Revenge_,\r\nand Blackbeard went aboard as captain. Teach now had a ship that allowed\r\nhim to go for larger prizes, and he began by taking a big ship called the\r\n_Great Allen_, which he plundered and then set fire to. A few days later,\r\nTeach was attacked by H.M.S. _Scarborough_, of thirty guns, but after a\r\nsharp engagement lasting some hours, the pirate was able to drive off the\r\nKing's ship.\r\n\r\nThe next ship he met with was the sloop of that amateur pirate and\r\nlandsman, Major Stede Bonnet. Teach and Bonnet became friends and sailed\r\ntogether for a few days, when Teach, finding that Bonnet was quite\r\nignorant of maritime matters, ordered the Major, in the most high-handed\r\nway, to come aboard his ship, while he put another officer in command of\r\nBonnet's vessel. Teach now took ship after ship, one of which, with the\r\ncurious name of the _Protestant Cæsar_, the pirates burnt out of spite,\r\nnot because of her name, but because she belonged to Boston, where there\r\nhad lately been a hanging of pirates.\r\n\r\nBlackbeard now sailed north along the American coast, arriving off\r\nCharleston, South Carolina. Here he lay off the bar for several days,\r\nseizing every vessel that attempted to enter or leave the port, \"striking\r\ngreat Terror to the whole Province of Carolina,\" the more so since the\r\ncolony was scarcely recovered from a recent visit by another pirate, Vane.\r\n\r\nBeing in want of medicines, Teach sent his lieutenant, Richards, on shore\r\nwith a letter to the Governor demanding that he should instantly send off\r\na medicine chest, or else Teach would murder all his prisoners, and\r\nthreatening to send their heads to Government House; many of these\r\nprisoners being the chief persons of the colony.\r\n\r\nTeach, who was unprincipled, even for a pirate, now commanded three\r\nvessels, and he wanted to get rid of his crews and keep all the booty for\r\nhimself and a few chosen friends. To do this, he contrived to wreck his\r\nown vessel and one of his sloops. Then with his friends and all the booty\r\nhe sailed off, leaving the rest marooned on a small sandy island. Teach\r\nnext sailed to North Carolina, and with the greatest coolness surrendered\r\nwith twenty of his men to the Governor, Charles Eden, and received the\r\nRoyal pardon. The ex-pirate spent the next few weeks in cultivating an\r\nintimate friendship with the Governor, who, no doubt, shared Teach's booty\r\nwith him.\r\n\r\nA romantic episode took place at this time at Bath Town. The pirate fell\r\nin love, not by any means for the first time, with a young lady of 16\r\nyears of age. To show his delight at this charming union, the Governor\r\nhimself married the happy pair, this being the captain's fourteenth wife;\r\nthough certain Bath Town gossips were heard to say that there were no\r\nfewer than twelve Mrs. Teach still alive at different ports up and down\r\nthe West India Islands.\r\n\r\nIn June, 1718, the bridegroom felt that the call of duty must be obeyed,\r\nso kissing good-bye to the new Mrs. Teach, he sailed away to the Bermudas,\r\nmeeting on his way half a dozen ships, which he plundered, and then\r\nhurried back to share the spoils with the Governor of North Carolina and\r\nhis secretary, Mr. Knight.\r\n\r\nFor several months, Blackbeard remained in the river, exacting a toll from\r\nall the shipping, often going ashore to make merry at the expense of the\r\nplanters. At length, things became so unbearable that the citizens and\r\nplanters sent a request to the Governor of the neighbouring colony of\r\nVirginia for help to rid them of the presence of Teach. The Governor,\r\nSpotswood, an energetic man, at once made plans for taking the pirate, and\r\ncommissioned a gallant young naval officer, Lieutenant Robert Maynard, of\r\nH.M.S. _Pearl_, to go in a sloop, the _Ranger_, in search of him. On\r\nNovember 17, 1718, the lieutenant sailed for Kicquetan in the James River,\r\nand on the 21st arrived at the mouth of Okerecock Inlet, where he\r\ndiscovered the pirate he was in search of. Blackbeard would have been\r\ncaught unprepared had not his friend, Mr. Secretary Knight, hearing what\r\nwas on foot, sent a letter warning him to be on his guard, and also any of\r\nTeach's crew whom he could find in the taverns of Bath Town. Maynard lost\r\nno time in attacking the pirate's ship, which had run aground. The fight\r\nwas furious, Teach boarding the sloop and a terrific hand-to-hand struggle\r\ntaking place, the lieutenant and Teach fighting with swords and pistols.\r\nTeach was wounded in twenty-five places before he fell dead, while the\r\nlieutenant escaped with nothing worse than a cut over the fingers.\r\n\r\nMaynard now returned in triumph in his sloop to Bath Town, with the head\r\nof Blackbeard hung up to the bolt-spit end, and received a tremendous\r\novation from the inhabitants.\r\n\r\nDuring his meteoric career as a pirate, the name of Blackbeard was one\r\nthat created terror up and down the coast of America from Newfoundland to\r\nTrinidad. This was not only due to the number of ships Teach took, but in\r\nno small measure to his alarming appearance. Teach was a tall, powerful\r\nman, with a fierce expression, which was increased by a long, black beard\r\nwhich grew from below his eyes and hung down to a great length. This he\r\nplaited into many tails, each one tied with a coloured ribbon and turned\r\nback over his ears. When going into action, Teach wore a sling on his\r\nshoulders with three pairs of pistols, and struck lighted matches under\r\nthe brim of his hat. These so added to his fearful appearance as to strike\r\nterror into all beholders. Teach had a peculiar sense of humour, and one\r\nthat could at times cause much uneasiness amongst his friends. Thus we are\r\ntold that one day on the deck of his ship, being at the time a little\r\nflushed with wine, Blackbeard addressed his crew, saying: \"Come let us\r\nmake a Hell of our own, and try how long we can bear it,\" whereupon Teach,\r\nwith several others, descended to the hold, shut themselves in, and then\r\nset fire to several pots of brimstone. For a while they stood it, choking\r\nand gasping, but at length had to escape to save themselves from being\r\nasphyxiated, but the last to give up was the captain, who was wont to\r\nboast afterwards that he had outlasted all the rest.\r\n\r\nThen there was that little affair in the cabin, when Teach blew out the\r\ncandle and in the dark fired his pistols under the table, severely\r\nwounding one of his guests in the knee, for no other reason, as he\r\nexplained to them afterwards, than \"if he did not shoot one or two of them\r\nnow and then they'd forget who he was.\"\r\n\r\nTeach kept a log or journal, which unfortunately is lost, but the entries\r\nfor two days have been preserved, and are worth giving, and seem to smack\r\nof Robert Louis Stevenson in \"Treasure Island.\" The entries, written in\r\nTeach's handwriting, run as follows:\r\n\r\n\"1718. Rum all out--Our Company somewhat sober--A damn'd Confusion amongst\r\nus!--Rogues a plotting--great Talk of Separation--so I look'd sharp for a\r\nPrize.\r\n\r\n\"1718. Took one, with a great deal of Liquor on Board, so kept the Company\r\nhot, damned hot, then all Things went well again.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nTEAGUE, ROBERT.\r\n\r\nA Scotch pirate, one of Captain Gow's crew. On May 26th, 1725, the crew\r\nwere tried in London and found guilty and sentenced to death, except\r\nTeague and two others who were acquitted.\r\n\r\n\r\nTEMPLETON, JOHN.\r\n\r\nOne of Captain John Quelch's crew of the ship _Charles_. Tried for piracy\r\nat Boston in 1704, but, being discovered to be not yet 14 years of age and\r\nonly a servant on board the pirate ship, was acquitted.\r\n\r\n\r\nTEW, Captain THOMAS, or Too.\r\n\r\nA famous pirate, whose headquarters were at Madagascar. He was mentioned\r\nby name in King William III.'s Royal Warrant to Captain Kidd to go hunting\r\nfor pirates, as a specially \"wicked and ill-disposed person.\"\r\n\r\nHe sailed with Captain Dew from the Barbadoes with a Commission from the\r\nGovernor to join with the Royal African Company in an attack on the French\r\nfactory at Goori, at Gambia. Instead of going to West Africa, Tew and his\r\ncrew turned pirates, and sailed to the Red Sea. Here he met with a great\r\nIndian ship, which he had the hardiness to attack, and soon took her, and\r\neach of his men received as his share £3,000, and with this booty they\r\nsailed to Madagascar. He was already held in high esteem by the pirates\r\nwho resided in that favourite stronghold. At one time he joined Misson,\r\nthe originator of \"piracy-without-tears\" at his garden city of Libertatia.\r\nA quarrel arose between Misson's French followers and Tew's English\r\npirates. A duel was arranged between the two leaders, but by the tact of\r\nanother pirate--an unfrocked Italian priest--all was settled amicably, Tew\r\nbeing appointed Admiral and the diplomatic ex-priest suitably chosen as\r\nSecretary of State to the little republic. Such a reputation for kindness\r\nhad Tew that ships seldom resisted him, but on knowing who their assailant\r\nwas they gave themselves up freely. Some of Tew's men started a daughter\r\ncolony on their own account, and the Admiral sailed after them to try and\r\npersuade them to return to the fold at Libertatia. The men refused, and\r\nwhile Tew was arguing and trying to persuade them to change their minds,\r\nhis ship was lost in a sudden storm. Tew was soon rescued by the ship\r\n_Bijoux_ with Misson on board, who, with a few men, had escaped being\r\nmassacred by the natives. Misson, giving Tew an equal share of his gold\r\nand diamonds, sailed away, while Tew managed to return to Rhode Island in\r\nNew England, where he settled down for a while. To show the honesty of\r\nthis man, being now affluent, he kept a promise to the friends in Bermuda\r\nwho originally set him up with a ship, by sending them fourteen times the\r\noriginal cost of the sloop as their just share of the profits.\r\n\r\nAt last, Tew found the call of the sea and the lure of the \"grand account\"\r\ntoo great to resist, and he consented to take command of a pirate ship\r\nwhich was to go on a cruise in the Red Sea. Arrived there, Tew attacked a\r\nbig ship belonging to the Great Mogul, and during the battle was mortally\r\nwounded.\r\n\r\nHis historian tells us \"a shot carried away the rim of Tew's belly, who\r\nheld his bowels with his hands for some space. When he dropped, it struck\r\nsuch terror to his men that they suffered themselves to be taken without\r\nfurther resistance.\" Thus fell fighting a fine sailor, a brave man, and a\r\nsuccessful pirate, and one who cheated the gallows awaiting him at\r\nExecution Dock.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHOMAS, CAPTAIN, _alias_ STEDE BONNET.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHOMAS, JOHN.\r\n\r\nOf Jamaica.\r\n\r\nThis Welsh pirate was one of Major Stede Bonnet's crew of the _Royal\r\nJames_. Hanged at Charleston, South Carolina, in 1718.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHOMPSON, CAPTAIN.\r\n\r\nA renegade pirate who joined the Barbary corsairs, becoming a Mohammedan.\r\nCommanded a pirate vessel, and was taken prisoner off the coast of Ireland\r\nby an Elizabethan ship. Hanged at Wapping.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHURBAR, RICHARD.\r\n\r\nTried for piracy at Boston in 1704.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHURSTON, CAPTAIN. Buccaneer.\r\n\r\nOf Tortuga Island.\r\n\r\nRefused to accept the Royal offer of pardon of 1670, when all commissions\r\nto privateer on the Spanish were revoked. Thurston, with a mulatto, Diego,\r\nusing obsolete commissions issued by the late Governor of Jamaica,\r\nModyford, continued to prey upon Spanish shipping, carrying their prizes\r\nto Tortuga.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHWAITES, CAPTAIN JOSEPH.\r\n\r\nCoxswain to Captain Hood, he was promoted in 1763 to be a midshipman in\r\nH.M.S. _Zealous_, cruising in the Mediterranean. Putting into Algiers,\r\nThwaites was sent ashore by the captain to buy some sheep, but did not\r\nreturn to the boat and, it being supposed he had been assassinated, the\r\nship sailed without him. The fact was that young Thwaites, who spoke\r\nTurkish and Greek, had accepted an invitation to enter the Ottoman\r\nservice. Embracing the Mohammedan religion, Thwaites was put in command of\r\na forty-four gun frigate.\r\n\r\nHis first engagement was with the flagship of the Tunisian Admiral, which\r\nhe took and carried to Algiers. He soon brought in another prize, and so\r\npleased the Dey that he presented him with a scimitar, the hilt of which\r\nwas set with diamonds.\r\n\r\nThwaites, having soiled his hands with blood, now became the pirate\r\nindeed, taking vessels of any nation, and drowning all his prisoners by\r\ntying a double-headed shot round their necks and throwing them overboard.\r\n\r\nHe stopped at no atrocity--even children were killed, and one prisoner, an\r\nEnglish lieutenant and an old shipmate of his, called Roberts, he murdered\r\nwithout a second thought. When Thwaites happened to be near Gibraltar, he\r\nwould go ashore and through his agents, Messrs. Ross and Co., transmit\r\nlarge sums of money to his wife and children in England. But Thwaites had\r\nanother home at Algiers fitted with every luxury, including three Armenian\r\ngirls.\r\n\r\nFor several years this successful pirate plundered ships of all nations\r\nuntil such pressure was brought to bear on the Dey of Algiers that\r\nThwaites thought it best to collect what valuables he could carry away and\r\ndisappear.\r\n\r\nLanding at Gibraltar in 1796, dressed in European clothes, he procured a\r\npassage to New York in an American frigate, the _Constitution_. Arriving\r\nin the United States, he purchased an estate not far from New York and\r\nbuilt himself a handsome mansion, but a year later retribution came from\r\nan unlooked-for quarter, for he was bitten by a rattlesnake and died in\r\nthe most horrible agonies both of mind and body.\r\n\r\n\r\nTOMKINS, JOHN.\r\n\r\nOf Gloucestershire.\r\n\r\nHanged at the age of 23 at Rhode Island in 1723. One of Charles Harris's\r\ncrew.\r\n\r\n\r\nTOPPING, DENNIS.\r\n\r\nHe shipped on board the sloop _Buck_ at Providence in 1718, in company\r\nwith Anstis and other famous pirates. Was killed at the taking of a rich\r\nPortuguese ship off the coast of Brazil.\r\n\r\n\r\nTOWNLEY, CAPTAIN. Buccaneer.\r\n\r\nA buccaneer who in the year 1684 was one of the mixed English and French\r\nfleet blockading Panama. On this occasion, he commanded a ship with a crew\r\nof 180 men. By the next year the quarrels between the English had reached\r\nsuch a pitch that Townley and Swan left Davis and sailed in search of\r\ntheir French friends. In May, 1685, Townley was amongst the company that\r\ntook and sacked Guayaquil. In January, 1686, Townley rescued the French\r\npirate Grogniet and some 350 Frenchmen who, when attacking the town of\r\nQuibo, were surprised by a Spanish squadron, which burnt their vessels\r\nwhile the crews were on shore. Townley then sailed north with his French\r\ncomrades and sacked Granada.\r\n\r\nHis next adventure was to take the town of Lavelia, near to Panama, where\r\nhe found a rich cargo which the Viceroy had placed on shore because he was\r\nafraid to send it to sea when so many pirates were about.\r\n\r\nIn August of the same year, Townley's ship was attacked by three Spanish\r\nmen-of-war. A furious fight took place, which ended by two of the Spanish\r\nships being captured and the third burnt. In this action the gallant\r\nTownley was gravely wounded, and died shortly afterwards.\r\n\r\n\r\nTRISTRIAN, CAPTAIN. French buccaneer.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1681 Dampier, with other malcontents, broke away from Captain\r\nSharp and marched on foot across the Isthmus of Darien. After undergoing\r\nterrible hardships for twenty-two days, the party arrived on the Atlantic\r\nseaboard, to find Captain Tristrian with his ship lying in La Sounds Cay.\r\n\r\nThe buccaneers bought red, blue, and green beads, and knives, scissors,\r\nand looking-glasses from the French pirates to give to their faithful\r\nIndian guides as parting gifts.\r\n\r\n\r\nTRYER, MATTHEW.\r\n\r\nA Carolina pirate, accused and acquitted on a charge of having captured a\r\nsloop belonging to Samuel Salters, of Bermuda, in 1699.\r\n\r\n\r\nTUCKER, ROBERT.\r\n\r\nOf the Island of Jamaica.\r\n\r\nOne of Major Stede Bonnet's crew. Tried, condemned, and hanged at\r\nCharleston, South Carolina, on November 8th, 1718. The prisoners were not\r\ndefended by counsel, because the members of the South Carolina Bar still\r\ndeemed it \"a base and vile thing to plead for money or reward.\" We\r\nunderstand that the barristers of South Carolina have since persuaded\r\nthemselves to overcome this prejudice. The result was that, with the\r\nfamous Judge Trott, a veritable terror to pirates, being President of the\r\nCourt of Vice-Admiralty, the prisoners had short and ready justice, and\r\nall but four of the thirty-five pirates tried were found guilty.\r\n\r\n\r\nTUCKERMAN, CAPTAIN.\r\n\r\nSailed with Captain Porter in the West Indies. Captain Johnson gives an\r\naccount of the meeting between these two pirate novices and the great\r\nCaptain Roberts at Hispaniola.\r\n\r\n\r\nTURNLEY, CAPTAIN RICHARD.\r\n\r\nA New Providence pirate who received the general pardon from Captain\r\nWoodes Rogers in 1718. When, a little later, the scandal of Captain\r\nRackam's infatuation for Anne Bonny was causing such gossip among the two\r\nthousand ex-pirates who formed the population of the settlement, it was\r\nTurnley who brought news of the affair to the notice of the Governor. In\r\nrevenge for this action, Rackam and his lady, one day hearing that Turnley\r\nhad sailed to a neighbouring island to catch turtles, followed him. It\r\nhappened that Turnley was on shore hunting wild pigs and so escaped, but\r\nRackam sank his sloop and took his crew away with him as prisoners.\r\n\r\n\r\nTYLE, CAPTAIN ORT VAN.\r\n\r\nA Dutchman from New York.\r\n\r\nA successful pirate in the days of the Madagascan sea-rovers. For some\r\ntime he sailed in company with Captain James, taking several prizes in the\r\nIndian Ocean.\r\n\r\nVan Tyle had a plantation at Madagascar and used to put his prisoners to\r\nwork there as slaves, one in particular being the notorious Welsh pirate,\r\nDavid Williams, who toiled with Van Tyles's other slaves for six months\r\nbefore making his escape to a friendly tribe in the neighbourhood.\r\n\r\n\r\nUPTON, BOATSWAIN JOHN.\r\n\r\nBorn in 1679 of honest parents at Deptford.\r\n\r\nApprenticed to a waterman, he afterwards went to sea, serving on different\r\nmen-of-war as a petty officer. Until July, 1723, when 40 years of age,\r\nUpton lived a perfectly honest life, but his wife dying, Upton found she\r\nhad contracted various debts and that he was in danger of being arrested\r\nby the creditors. Leaving his four orphans, Upton hurried to Poole in\r\nDorsetshire, and was taken on as boatswain in the _John and Elizabeth_\r\n(Captain Hooper), bound for Bonavista in Newfoundland. He seems to have\r\ncontinued to sail as an honest seaman until November 14th, 1725, when\r\nserving as boatswain in the _Perry_ galley, on a voyage between Barbadoes\r\nand Bristol, the vessel was taken by a pirate, Cooper, in the _Night\r\nRambler_. At his subsequent trial witnesses declared that Upton willingly\r\njoined the pirates, signed their articles, and was afterwards one of their\r\nmost active and cruel men.\r\n\r\nUpton kept a journal, which was his only witness for his defence, in which\r\nhe described how he was forced to sign the pirates' articles under threats\r\nof instant death. If his journal is to be believed, Upton escaped from the\r\npirates at the first opportunity, landing on the Mosquito coast. After\r\nbeing arrested by the Spaniards as a spy, he was sent from one prison to\r\nanother in Central America, at last being put on board a galleon at Porto\r\nBello, to be sent to Spain. Escaping, he got aboard a New York sloop and\r\narrived at Jamaica in December, 1726. While at Port Royal he was pressed\r\non board H.M.S. _Nottingham_, serving in her for more than two years as\r\nquartermaster, until one day he was accused of having been a pirate. Under\r\nthis charge he was brought a prisoner to England in 1729, tried in London,\r\nand hanged, protesting his innocence to the last.\r\n\r\n\r\nURUJ. See BARBAROSSA.\r\n\r\n\r\nVALLANUEVA, CAPTAIN.\r\n\r\nA Dominican.\r\n\r\nCommanded in 1831 a small gaff-topsail schooner, the _General Morazan_,\r\narmed with a brass eight-pounder and carrying a mixed crew of forty-four\r\nmen, French, Italian, English, and Creoles of St. Domingo.\r\n\r\n\r\nVANCLEIN, CAPTAIN MOSES. Dutch filibuster.\r\n\r\nWas serving with L'Ollonais's fleet off the coast of Yucatan when a mutiny\r\nbroke out, of which Vanclein was the ringleader. He persuaded the\r\nmalcontents to sail with him along the coast till they came to Costa Rica.\r\nThere they landed and marched to the town of Veraguas, which they seized\r\nand pillaged. The pirates got little booty, only eight pounds of gold, it\r\nproving to be a poor place.\r\n\r\n\r\nVANE, CAPTAIN CHARLES.\r\n\r\nFamous for his piratical activities off the coast of North America,\r\nspecially the Carolinas.\r\n\r\nIn 1718, when Woodes Rogers was sent by the English Government to break up\r\nthe pirate stronghold in the Bahama Islands, all the pirates at New\r\nProvidence Island surrendered to Rogers and received the King's pardon\r\nexcept Vane, who, after setting fire to a prize he had, slipped out of the\r\nbay as Rogers with his two men-of-war entered. Vane sailed to the coast of\r\nCarolina, as did other West Indian pirates who found their old haunts too\r\nwarm for them.\r\n\r\nVane is first heard of as being actively engaged in stealing from the\r\nSpaniards the silver which they were salving from a wrecked galleon in the\r\nGulf of Florida. Tiring of this, Vane stole a vessel and ranged up and\r\ndown the coast from Florida to New York, taking ship after ship, until at\r\nlast the Governor of South Carolina sent out a Colonel Rhet in an armed\r\nsloop to try and take him. On one occasion Vane met the famous Blackbeard,\r\nwhom he saluted with his great guns loaded with shot. This compliment of\r\none pirate chief to another was returned in like kind, and then \"mutual\r\ncivilities\" followed for several days between the two pirate captains and\r\ntheir crews, these civilities taking the form of a glorious debauch in a\r\nquiet creek on the coast.\r\n\r\nVane soon had a change of fortune, when, meeting with a French man-of-war,\r\nhe decided to decline an engagement and to seek safety in flight, greatly\r\nto the anger of his crew. For this he was obliged to stand the test of the\r\nvote of the whole crew, who passed a resolution against his honour and\r\ndignity, and branded him a coward, deprived him of his command, and packed\r\nhim off with a few of his adherents in a small sloop. Vane, not\r\ndiscouraged by this reverse of fortune, rose again from the bottom rung of\r\nthe ladder to success, and quickly increased in strength of ships and\r\ncrew, until one day, being overcome by a sudden tornado, he lost\r\neverything but his life, being washed up on a small uninhabited island off\r\nthe Honduras coast. Here he managed to support life by begging food from\r\nthe fishermen who occasionally came there in their canoes.\r\n\r\nAt last a ship put in for water, commanded by one Captain Holford, who\r\nhappened to be an old friend of Vane's. Vane naturally was pleased at this\r\npiece of good fortune, and asked his dear old friend to take him off the\r\nisland in his ship, to which Holford replied: \"Charles, I shan't trust you\r\naboard my ship, unless I carry you as a prisoner, for I shall have you\r\ncaballing with my men, knock me on the head, and run away with my ship\r\na-pirating.\" No promises of good behaviour from Vane would prevail on his\r\nfriend to rescue him; in fact, Captain Holford's parting remark was that\r\nhe would be returning in a month, and that if he then found Vane still on\r\nthe island he would carry him to Jamaica to be hanged.\r\n\r\nSoon after Holford's departure another ship put in for water, none of the\r\ncrew of which knew Vane by sight, and he was too crafty to let them find\r\nout the notorious pirate he was. They consented to take off the\r\nshipwrecked mariner, when, just as all seemed to be going well, back came\r\nthe ship of friend Holford. Holford, who seems to have been a sociable\r\nkind of man, was well acquainted with the captain who was befriending\r\nVane, and Holford was invited to dine on board his ship. As the guest was\r\npassing along the deck of his host's ship on his way to the great cabin he\r\nchanced to glance down the open hold, and there who should he see but his\r\ndear old friend Vane hard at work; for he had already won his new master's\r\ngood graces by being a \"brisk hand.\" Holford at once informed his host\r\nthat he was entertaining a notorious pirate, and with his consent clapped\r\nVane in irons, and removed him to his own ship, and when he arrived in\r\nJamaica handed his old friend to the justices, who quickly tried,\r\nconvicted, and hanged him.\r\n\r\n\r\nVANHORN, CAPTAIN NICHOLAS. A Dutch filibuster.\r\n\r\nOf Hispaniola.\r\n\r\nSailed from England in 1681 in command of the _Mary and Martha_, _alias_\r\nthe _St. Nicholas_, a merchant ship. Vanhorn soon showed his hand by\r\nputting two of his merchants ashore at Cadiz and stealing four Spanish\r\nguns. Next he sailed to the Canary Islands, and then to the Guinea coast,\r\nplundering ships and stealing negroes, until November, 1682, when he\r\narrived at the city of San Domingo. In April, 1683, he picked up some 300\r\nbuccaneers at Petit Goave, and joined the filibuster Laurens in the Gulf\r\nof Honduras with six other buccaneer captains, who were planning an attack\r\non the rich city of Vera Cruz. The fleet arrived off the city in May, and\r\nthe pirates, hearing that the Spaniards were expecting the arrival of two\r\nships from Caracas, they crowded a landing party of 800 men into two\r\nships, and, displaying Spanish colours, stood in boldly for the city. The\r\ninhabitants, imagining these were the ships they were expecting, actually\r\nlit bonfires to pilot them into the harbour. Landing on May 17th two miles\r\naway, they soon found themselves masters of the town and forts, all the\r\nsentinels being asleep. For four days they plundered the churches,\r\nconvents, and houses, and threatened to burn the cathedral, in which they\r\nhad put all the prisoners, unless more booty was forthcoming. An\r\nEnglishman found the Governor hiding in some hay in a loft, and he was\r\nransomed for 70,000 pieces of eight. While this was taking place a Spanish\r\nfleet of fourteen ships had arrived from Cadiz, and anchored just outside\r\nthe harbour, but would not venture to land nor to attack the buccaneer\r\nships. The buccaneers, feeling it was time to depart, sailed right past\r\nthe fleet without opposition to a cay not far off, and there divided the\r\nspoils; each of the 1,000 sailors getting 800 pieces of eight as his\r\nshare, while Vanhorn's own share, was 24,000 pieces of eight. This\r\ndivision of the spoil did not take place without some bickering, and the\r\ntwo leaders, Vanhorn and Laurens, came to blows, and Vanhorn was wounded\r\nin the wrist. Although the wound was little more than a scratch, he died\r\nof gangrene a fortnight later.\r\n\r\nIt is significant that Vanhorn had originally been sent out by the\r\nGovernor of Hispaniola to hunt for pirates, but once out of sight of land\r\nand away from authority the temptation to get rich quickly was too great\r\nto resist, so that he joined the pirates in the expedition to sack Vera\r\nCruz.\r\n\r\n\r\nVEALE, CAPTAIN.\r\n\r\nOn July 1st, 1685, he arrived at New London in a sloop, but was compelled\r\nto hurry away, being recognized as a pirate by one of the crew of a ship\r\nhe had previously taken in Virginia.\r\n\r\n\r\nVEALE, THOMAS.\r\n\r\nOne of four New England pirates who in the middle of the seventeenth\r\ncentury rowed up the Saugus river and landed at a place called Lynn Woods.\r\nThe boat contained, besides the pirates, a quantity of plunder and a\r\nbeautiful young woman. They built a hut on Dungeon Rock, dug a well, and\r\nlived there until the woman died. Three of the pirates were captured, and\r\nended their days on the gallows in England.\r\n\r\nThomas Veale escaped and went to live in a cave, where he is supposed to\r\nhave hidden his booty, but he continued to work as a cordwainer. In the\r\nearthquake of 1658 the cave was blocked up by pieces of rock, and Veale\r\nwas never seen again.\r\n\r\n\r\nVERPRE, CAPTAIN. French filibuster.\r\n\r\nHis ship _Le Postillion_ carried a crew of twenty-five men and was armed\r\nwith two guns.\r\n\r\n\r\nVIGERON, CAPTAIN. French filibuster.\r\n\r\nOf San Domingo.\r\n\r\nCommanded a bark, _La Louse_, thirty men and four guns.\r\n\r\n\r\nVILLA RISE.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1621 this Moorish pirate commanded a small squadron of five\r\nvessels which took an English ship, the _George Bonaventure_ (Captain John\r\nRawlins, Plymouth), in the Straits of Gibraltar. One of the finest deeds\r\never achieved by English sailors was the escape of Rawlins and some of his\r\ncrew from the Moors at Alexandria in a stolen ship.\r\n\r\n\r\nVAN VIN, MOSES. Buccaneer.\r\n\r\nOne of L'Ollonais's officers. After burning Puerto Cavallo and torturing\r\nand murdering the inhabitants, L'Ollonais marched away to attack the town\r\nof San Pedro with 300 of his crew, leaving van Vin as his lieutenant to\r\ngovern the rest of his men during his absence.\r\n\r\n\r\nVIRGIN, HENRY.\r\n\r\nOf Bristol.\r\n\r\nOne of Major Stede Bonnet's crew of the _Royal James_. Hanged for piracy\r\nat White Point, Charleston, South Carolina, on November 8th, 1718, and\r\nburied in the marsh below low-water mark.\r\n\r\n\r\nVIVON, CAPTAIN M. LA. French filibuster.\r\n\r\nCommanded the _Cour Valant_ of La Rochelle. In December, 1668, his ship\r\nwas seized by Captain Collier for having robbed an English ship of\r\nprovisions.\r\n\r\n\r\nWAFER, LIONEL. Surgeon, buccaneer, and author.\r\n\r\nBelieved to have been born about the year 1660.\r\n\r\nHe could speak Gaelic and also Erse, which languages he had learnt during\r\nhis childhood, which was spent partly in the Highlands of Scotland and\r\npartly in Ireland.\r\n\r\nIn 1677 he sailed as mate to the surgeon of the _Great Ann_, of London\r\n(Captain Zachary Browne), bound for Java.\r\n\r\nTwo years later, he again sailed as surgeon's mate on a voyage to the West\r\nIndies. He deserted his ship at Jamaica and set himself up as a surgeon at\r\nPort Royal, but one day meeting with two noted buccaneers, Captain Linch\r\nand Captain Cook, he agreed to sail with them as ship's surgeon.\r\n\r\nWafer's subsequent adventures are recounted by Basil Ringrose in his\r\n\"Dangerous Voyage and Bold Assaults of Captain Bartholomew Sharp and\r\nOthers,\" and by William Dampier in his \"New Voyage Round the World.\"\r\nAfter taking part in 1679 in the futile expedition of the buccaneers to\r\nPanama, Wafer joined the party of malcontents who left Captain Sharp and\r\nreturned on foot across the Isthmus of Darien. Wafer was accidentally\r\nwounded in the knee by an explosion of gunpowder on May 5th, 1681, which\r\nhe recounts in his narrative as follows: \"I was sitting on the ground near\r\none of our Men, who was drying of Gunpowder in a Silver Plate: But not\r\nmanaging it as he should, it blew up and scorch'd my knee to that degree,\r\nthat the bone was left bare, the Flesh being torn away, and my Thigh burnt\r\nfor a great way above it. I applied to it immediately such Remedies as I\r\nhad in my knapsack: and being unwilling to be left behind by my\r\ncompanions, I made hard shift to jog on.\"\r\n\r\nThe whole story of these adventures is told by Wafer in a book he wrote,\r\nand which was published in London in 1699. It is called \"A New Voyage and\r\nDescription of the Isthmus of America, giving an Account of the Author's\r\nAbode there,\" and is illustrated by some quaint copperplates.\r\n\r\nWafer and his companions suffered extreme hardships as they struggled\r\nthrough the dense tropical jungle during the wettest season of the year.\r\n\r\nOn one occasion when in danger of his life, Wafer was spared by the\r\nIndians owing to his skill as a phlebotomist, after he had been allowed to\r\nexhibit his skill to an Indian chief called Lacentra, when he bled one of\r\nhis wives so successfully that the chief made Wafer his inseparable\r\ncompanion, to the no little discomfort of the buccaneer, who wished to\r\nreach the Atlantic and rejoin his companions who had left him behind.\r\n\r\nWafer described the birds, animals, fishes, and insects with considerable\r\nminuteness, although it is obvious that he had no special training in, or\r\ngreat gift for, natural history. Wafer eventually reached Philadelphia,\r\nwhere he availed himself of King James's general pardon to pirates.\r\n\r\n\r\nWAKE, CAPTAIN THOMAS.\r\n\r\nA notorious pirate, one of those particularly named in the Royal Warrant\r\nissued in 1695 to Captain Kidd, authorizing him to go in search of the\r\nAmerican pirates.\r\n\r\n\r\nWALDEN, JOHN, _alias_ \"MISS NANNEY.\"\r\n\r\nBorn in Somersetshire.\r\n\r\nTaken in the _Blessing_, of Lymington, by Roberts in Newfoundland, he\r\njoined the pirates, and was later on hanged at the age of 24 in West\r\nAfrica. Walden was one of Captain Roberts's most active men. On taking\r\nCaptain Traher's ship, Walden carried a pole-axe with which he wrenched\r\nopen locked doors and boxes. He was a bold and daring man, of violent\r\ntemper, and was known amongst his shipmates by the nickname of Miss\r\nNanney. He lost a leg during the attack on the _Swallow_. After the\r\npirates took the _King Solomon_, Walden had to get up the anchor, but he\r\ncut the cable, explaining to the captain that the weather was too hot to\r\ngo straining and crying \"Yo Hope,\" and he could easily buy another anchor\r\nwhen he got to London.\r\n\r\n\r\nWANSLEY, THOMAS.\r\n\r\nA negro steward on the brig _Vineyard_, he mutinied and assisted to murder\r\nthe captain and mate, afterwards becoming one of Captain Charles Gibbs's\r\ncrew. Hanged at New York in February, 1831.\r\n\r\n\r\nWANT, CAPTAIN.\r\n\r\nA Carolina pirate who was referred to at the trial of Captain Avery's crew\r\nat London in 1696.\r\n\r\n\r\nWARD.\r\n\r\nOne of the first English pirates to establish himself on the Barbary coast\r\nin North Africa. By the year 1613 some thirty others had their\r\nheadquarters at the mouth of the Sebu River.\r\n\r\n\r\nWARD, CAPTAIN.\r\n\r\nAs a poor English sailor he went to Barbary, turned Mohammedan, offered\r\nhis services to the Moors, and became captain of a galley. He grew to be\r\nvery rich, and \"lived like a Bashaw in Barbary.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nWARREN, WILLIAM.\r\n\r\nJoined Captain Pound's crew from Lovell's Island.\r\n\r\n\r\nWATERS, JOHN.\r\n\r\nOf Devonshire.\r\n\r\nQuartermaster to Captain Charles Harris. Tried and hanged at Newport,\r\nRhode Island, on July 19th, 1734. Aged 35.\r\n\r\n\r\nWATKINS, JOHN.\r\n\r\nAn English soldier stationed at Fort Loyal, Falmouth, Maine. Deserted and\r\nsailed with the pirate Pound. Killed at Tarpaulin Cove in 1689.\r\n\r\n\r\nWATLING, CAPTAIN JOHN. Buccaneer.\r\n\r\nWhen Bartholomew Sharp's crew mutinied on New Year's Day in 1681 on the\r\n_Most Holy Trinity_, they clapped their captain in irons and put him down\r\nbelow on the ballast, and elected an old pirate and a \"stout seaman,\" John\r\nWatling, in his place. One of the reasons for the revolt was said to be\r\nthe ungodliness of Captain Sharp.\r\n\r\nWatling began his command by giving orders for the strict keeping of the\r\nSabbath Day, and on January 9th the buccaneers observed Sunday as a day\r\napart, the first for many months. One of the first acts of this godly\r\nCaptain Watling was to cruelly shoot an old man, a prisoner, whom he\r\nsuspected, quite wrongly, of not telling the truth.\r\n\r\nOn January 30th Watling headed a surprise attack on the town of Arica in\r\nNorth Chile, but it turned out later that the Spaniards had three days'\r\nwarning of the intended attack, and had gathered together no less than\r\n2,000 defenders. A furious attack was made, with great slaughter of the\r\nSpanish defenders and considerable loss amongst the pirates. In one attack\r\nWatling placed 100 of his prisoners in front of his storming party, hoping\r\nthis would prevent the enemy firing at them. After taking the town, the\r\nbuccaneers were driven out owing to the arrival of a number of Lima\r\nsoldiers. During the retreat from the town Watling was shot in the liver\r\nand died. Perhaps he gave his name to Watling Island in the Bahama\r\nIslands, the first spot of America that Christopher Columbus ever saw, and\r\na great resort of the buccaneers.\r\n\r\n\r\nWATSON, HENRY.\r\n\r\nOne of Captain Lowther's crew in the _Happy Delivery_. Hanged at St. Kitts\r\non March 11th, 1722.\r\n\r\n\r\nWATTS, EDWARD.\r\n\r\nBorn at Dunmore.\r\n\r\nOne of Captain Roberts's crew. Hanged in 1722 at the age of 22.\r\n\r\n\r\nWATTS, SAMUEL.\r\n\r\nOf Lovell's Island.\r\n\r\nOne of Captain Pound's crew.\r\n\r\n\r\nWATTS, WILLIAM.\r\n\r\nAn Irishman.\r\n\r\nHanged, at the age of 23, along with the rest of Roberts's crew.\r\n\r\n\r\nWAY, JOHN.\r\n\r\nTried at Boston in 1704 for piracy with the rest of the crew of the\r\n_Charles_ brigantine.\r\n\r\n\r\nWEAVER, CAPTAIN BRIGSTOCK.\r\n\r\nOf Hereford, England.\r\n\r\nOne of Captain Anstis's crew in the _Good Fortune_ when he took the\r\n_Morning Star_. After the prize had been converted for Anstis's use,\r\nWeaver was given command of the _Good Fortune_. He proved himself to be a\r\ncapable pirate captain, taking between fifty and sixty sailing ships in\r\nthe West Indies and on the Banks of Newfoundland.\r\n\r\nHere are particulars of a few of his prizes:\r\n\r\nIn August, 1722, he took a Dutch ship, and out of her got 100 pieces of\r\nholland, value £800, and 1,000 pieces of eight. On November 20th in the\r\nsame year he plundered the _Dolphin_, of London (Captain William Haddock),\r\nof 300 pieces of eight and forty gallons of rum.\r\n\r\nOut of the _Don Carlos_ (Lot Neekins, master) he stole 400 ounces of\r\nsilver, fifty gallons of rum, 1,000 pieces of eight, 100 pistols, and\r\nother valuable goods.\r\n\r\nOut of the _Portland_, ten pipes of wine valued at £250.\r\n\r\nThis period of prosperity came to an end, for in May, 1723, Weaver,\r\ndressed in rags, was begging charity at the door of a Mr. Thomas Smith in\r\nBristol, telling a plausible tale of how he had been taken and robbed by\r\nsome wicked pirates, but had lately managed to escape from them. The\r\nkindly Mr. Smith, together with a Captain Edwards, gave Weaver £10 and\r\nprovided him with a lodging at the Griffin Inn. Being now dressed in good\r\nclothes, Weaver enjoyed walking about the streets of Bristol, until one\r\nday he met with a sea-captain who claimed former acquaintance and invited\r\nhim into a neighbouring tavern to share a bottle of wine with him. Over\r\nthis the captain reminded the pirate that he had been one of his victims,\r\nand that Weaver had once stolen from him a considerable quantity of\r\nliquor; but at the same time he had not forgotten that the pirate had used\r\nhim very civilly, and that therefore, if he would give him four hogsheads\r\nof cider, nothing further would be said about the matter. Weaver would\r\nnot, or could not, produce these, and was apprehended, brought to London,\r\nand there tried and sentenced to death, and hanged at Execution Dock.\r\n\r\n\r\nWELLS, LIEUTENANT JOSEPH.\r\n\r\nAn officer on board Captain John Quelch's _Charles_ galley. Attempted to\r\nescape at Gloucester, Massachusetts, in the _Larimore_, but was captured\r\nby Major Sewell and brought to Salem, and there secured in the town gaol\r\nuntil tried for piracy at Boston in June, 1704.\r\n\r\n\r\nWEST, RICHARD.\r\n\r\nOne of Captain Lowther's crew. Hanged at St. Kitts in March, 1722.\r\n\r\n\r\nWETHERLEY, TEE.\r\n\r\nA Massachusetts pirate, with only one eye. Captured in 1699 with the\r\npirate Joseph Bradish and put in prison. They escaped two months later. A\r\nreward of £200 was offered for the recapture of Wetherley, which was\r\ngained by a Kennekeck Indian called Essacambuit, who brought him back to\r\nprison. He was taken, in irons, to England in H.M.S. _Advice_ in 1700,\r\nand tried and hanged in London.\r\n\r\n\r\nWHETSTONE, SIR THOMAS, or WHITSTONE. Buccaneer.\r\n\r\nIn 1663 he commanded a ship, a Spanish prize, armed with seven guns and\r\ncarrying a crew of sixty men. In August, 1666, Sir Thomas was with a small\r\nEnglish garrison of some sixty men in the buccaneer stronghold of New\r\nProvidence in the Bahama Islands. Suddenly a Spanish fleet arrived from\r\nPorto Bello, and after a siege of three days the garrison capitulated. The\r\nthree English captains were carried prisoners to Panama and there cast\r\ninto a dungeon and bound in irons for seventeen months.\r\n\r\n\r\nWHITE, CAPTAIN THOMAS. South Sea pirate. An Englishman. Born at Plymouth.\r\n\r\nAs a young man he was taken prisoner by a French pirate off the coast of\r\nGuinea. The French massacred their prisoners by painting targets on their\r\nchests and using them for rifle practice. White alone was saved by an\r\nheroic Frenchman throwing himself in front of him and receiving the volley\r\nin his own body. White sailed with the French pirates, who were wrecked on\r\nthe coast of Madagascar. White himself managed to escape, and found safety\r\nwith a native, King Bavaw, but the French pirates were all massacred.\r\nWhite not very long afterwards joined another pirate ship, commanded by a\r\nCaptain Read, with whom he sailed, helping to take several prizes, amongst\r\nothers a slave ship, the _Speaker_. White soon found himself possessed of\r\na considerable fortune, and settled down with his crew at a place called\r\nMethelage in Madagascar, marrying a native woman, and leading the peaceful\r\nlife of a planter. The call of piracy at length proving irresistible, he\r\nsailed before the mast with Captain Halsey, then returned to his native\r\nwife and home, shortly afterwards to die of fever.\r\n\r\nIn his will, he left legacies to various relatives and friends, and\r\nappointed three guardians for his son, all of different nationalities,\r\nwith instructions that the boy should be taken to England to be educated,\r\nwhich was duly done.\r\n\r\nWhite was buried with the full ceremonies of the Church of England, his\r\nsword and pistols being carried on his coffin, and three English and one\r\nFrench volley fired over his grave.\r\n\r\n\r\nWHITE, JAMES.\r\n\r\nHanged in Virginia in 1718 along with the rest of Captain Edward Teach's\r\ncrew.\r\n\r\n\r\nWHITE, ROBERT.\r\n\r\nOne of Captain George Lowther's crew. Hanged on March 22nd, 1722, at St.\r\nKitts.\r\n\r\n\r\nWHITE, WILLIAM.\r\n\r\nA Newfoundland fish-splitter. With John Phillips and three others, he\r\nstole a fishing-boat at St. Peter's Harbour in Newfoundland in August,\r\n1723. The other four were made officers in the pirate craft, White having\r\nthe distinction of being the only private man in the crew of five. He\r\nappears to have been a man lacking in ambition, as he never showed any\r\ndesire to become even a petty officer amongst the pirates; in fact, we\r\nhear no more of William until June 2nd, 1724, when he was hanged at Boston\r\nand \"dy'd very penitently, with the Assistance of two grave Divines that\r\nattended him.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nWHITTING, WILLIAM.\r\n\r\nOne of Captain Quelch's crew. In 1704 we read that he \"lyes sick, like to\r\ndye, not yet examined\" in the gaol at Marblehead, when awaiting trial for\r\npiracy.\r\n\r\n\r\nWIFE, FRANCIS.\r\n\r\nAn unwilling mutineer with Philip Roche in a French vessel sailing from\r\nCork in 1721.\r\n\r\n\r\nWILES, WILLIAM.\r\n\r\nOne of John Quelch's crew of the brigantine _Charles_. Tried at Boston in\r\n1704.\r\n\r\n\r\nWILGRESS, CAPTAIN. Buccaneer.\r\n\r\nOf Jamaica.\r\n\r\nSent by the Governor of Jamaica in 1670 to search for, and capture or\r\nsink, a Dutchman called Captain Yallahs, who had entered the Spanish\r\nservice to cruise against the English logwood cutters. But Wilgress,\r\ninstead of carrying out his orders, went a-buccaneering on his own\r\naccount, chasing a Spanish vessel ashore, stealing logwood, and burning\r\nSpanish houses along the coast.\r\n\r\n\r\nWILLIAMS, CAPTAIN JOHN, _alias_ \"YANKY.\" Buccaneer.\r\n\r\nIn 1683, when the pirate Hamlin in his famous ship, _La Trompeuse_, was\r\nplaying havoc with the English shipping around Jamaica, Governor Lynch\r\noffered Williams a free pardon, men, victuals, and naturalization, and\r\n£200 as well if he would catch the Frenchman.\r\n\r\n\r\nWILLIAMS, CAPTAIN MORRIS. Buccaneer.\r\n\r\nIn November, 1664, he applied to Governor Modyford to be allowed to bring\r\ninto Port Royal, Jamaica, a rich prize of logwood, indigo, and silver,\r\nand, in spite of the Governor's refusal, he brought the ship in. The goods\r\nwere seized and sold in the interest of the Spanish owner. At this time\r\nthe English Government was doing all it could to stamp out the pirates and\r\nbuccaneers.\r\n\r\n\r\nWILLIAMS, CAPTAIN PAUL.\r\n\r\nA Carolina pirate, who began as a wrecker with the pirate Bellamy in the\r\nWest Indies. He later on took to piracy and ended a not too glorious\r\ncareer by being hanged at Eastman, Massachusetts. Williams was one of the\r\npirates who accepted King George's offer of pardon at New Providence\r\nIsland in 1718.\r\n\r\n\r\nWILLIAMS, DAVID.\r\n\r\nThis son of a Welsh farmer was a poor pirate but a born soldier. He was\r\ndescribed by one who knew him as being morose, sour, unsociable, and\r\nill-tempered, and that he \"knew as little of the sea or of ships as he did\r\nof the Arts of Natural Philosophy.\" But it is recorded to his credit that\r\nhe was not cruel. He started life in a merchant ship bound for India, and\r\nwas accidentally left behind in Madagascar. Taken care of by friendly\r\nnatives, he fought so well on the side of his benefactors in an\r\ninter-tribal battle that the King made him his intimate friend. A little\r\nlater this tribe was wiped out and Williams taken prisoner. The King of\r\nthis hostile tribe, knowing Williams to be a brave man, put him in charge\r\nof his army, for his success as a leader was known far and wide. He was\r\nnext seized by a very powerful King, Dempaino, who made him\r\nCommander-in-Chief over his army of 6,000 men, and supplied him with\r\nslaves, clothes, and everything he could want. After several years as\r\ncommander of Dempaino's army, a pirate ship, the _Mocha_ (Captain\r\nCulliford), arrived on the coast, and Williams escaped in her and went for\r\na cruise. He was afterwards captured by the Dutch pirate Ort Van Tyle of\r\nNew York, and made to work as a slave on his plantation. After six months\r\nhe escaped and sought safety with a Prince Rebaiharang, with whom he lived\r\nfor a year. He next joined a Dutchman, Pro, who had a small settlement,\r\nto be again taken prisoner by an English frigate. In a skirmish between\r\nthe crew and some natives, Williams and Pro managed to escape, and,\r\nprocuring a boat, joined Captain White's pirates at Methalage, in\r\nMadagascar.\r\n\r\nWilliams now spent his time pirating, unsuccessfully, until one day in a\r\nsloop he attempted a raid on an Arab town at Boyn. This attempt proved a\r\nfiasco, and Williams was caught by the Arabs, cruelly tortured, and\r\nfinally killed by a lance thrust. He was so loved and admired by the\r\nMadagascar natives that his friend and benefactor, King Dempaino, seized\r\nthe Arab chief of Boyn and executed him in revenge for the death of\r\nWilliams. Williams seems to have been as much beloved by the natives as he\r\nwas hated by men of his own colour. As a pirate he was a failure, but as a\r\nsoldier of fortune with the native tribes he was a great success.\r\n\r\n\r\nWILLIAMS, JOHN.\r\n\r\nA Cornish pirate, who sailed from Jamaica with Captain Morrice, and was\r\ncaptured by the Dutch. Eventually he reached Boston, and sailed with\r\nCaptain Roderigo in 1674 in the _Edward and Thomas_, a Boston vessel.\r\n\r\nTried for piracy, but acquitted.\r\n\r\n\r\nWILLIAMS, LIEUTENANT JAMES. Welsh pirate.\r\n\r\nSailed as a hand on board the _George_ galley from Amsterdam in 1724.\r\nConspiring with Gow to bring about a mutiny, he took an active part in\r\nmurdering the captain, the chief mate, super cargo, and surgeon. Gow\r\npromoted him to be his mate. He was a violent, brutal man, and a bully. On\r\none occasion, he accused Gow of cowardice, and snapped his pistol in Gow's\r\nface, but the weapon failed to go off, and two seamen standing by shot\r\nWilliams, wounding him in the arm and belly. The next day Gow sent away a\r\ncrew of prisoners in a sloop he had taken and plundered, and Williams,\r\nheavily manacled, was cast into the hold of this vessel, with orders that\r\nhe should be given up as a pirate to the first English man-of-war they\r\nshould meet with. He was taken to Lisbon and there put on board H.M.S.\r\n_Argyle_, and carried to London. When Gow and his crew eventually arrived\r\nin irons at the Marshalsea Prison, they found Williams already there\r\nawaiting trial. Hanged at Newgate on June 11th, 1725, his body being\r\nhanged in chains at Blackwall.\r\n\r\n\r\nWILLIAMS, WILLIAM.\r\n\r\n\"Habitation--nigh Plymouth.\"\r\n\r\nOne of Captain Roberts's crew. Deserted the pirates at Sierra Leone, but\r\nwas delivered up by the negroes, and as a punishment received two lashes\r\nfrom the whole ship's company. Hanged at the age of 40.\r\n\r\n\r\nWILLIS, ROBERT.\r\n\r\nOne of Captain George Lowther's crew. Tried for piracy at St. Kitts in\r\nMarch, 1722, and acquitted.\r\n\r\n\r\nWILSON, ALEXANDER.\r\n\r\nOne of the mutineers of the ship _Antonio_. Hanged at Boston in 1672.\r\n\r\n\r\nWILSON, GEORGE. Surgeon and pirate.\r\n\r\nOriginally he sailed as surgeon in a Liverpool ship, the _Tarlton_, which\r\nwas taken by the pirate Bartholomew Roberts. Wilson voluntarily joined the\r\npirates. One day, being accidentally left on shore, he had to remain\r\namongst the negroes at Sestos on the West Coast of Africa for five\r\nmonths, until he was eventually rescued by a Captain Sharp, of the\r\n_Elizabeth_, who ransomed Wilson for the value of £3 5s. in goods. Wilson\r\nwas again captured by Roberts, and served with him as surgeon. At his\r\ntrial for piracy at Cape Coast Castle in 1722, witnesses proved that\r\nWilson was \"very alert and cheerful at meeting with Roberts, hailed him,\r\ntold him he was glad to see him, and would come on board presently,\r\nborrowing a clean Shirt and Drawers\" from the witness \"for his better\r\nAppearance and Reception: signed the Articles willingly,\" and tried to\r\npersuade him, the witness, to sign also, as then they would each get £600\r\nor £700 a man in the next voyage to Brazil.\r\n\r\nWhen the election of senior surgeon took place, Wilson wanted to be\r\nappointed, as then he would receive a bigger share of the booty. Wilson\r\nbecame very intimate with Captain Roberts, and told him that if ever they\r\nwere taken by one of the \"Turnip-Man's ships\"--_i.e.,_ a man-of-war--they\r\nwould blow up their ship and go to hell together. But the surgeon proved\r\nsuch a lazy ruffian, neglecting to dress the wounded crew, that Roberts\r\nthreatened to cut his ears off.\r\n\r\nAt the trial Wilson was found guilty and condemned to be hanged, but his\r\nexecution was withheld until the King's pleasure was known, because it was\r\nbelieved that owing to information given by Wilson a mutiny of the\r\nprisoners was prevented.\r\n\r\n\r\nWILSON, JAMES.\r\n\r\nOf Dublin.\r\n\r\nOne of Major Stede Bonnet's crew in the _Royal James_. Hanged at\r\nCharleston, South Carolina, on November 8th, 1718, and buried in the marsh\r\nbelow low-water mark.\r\n\r\n\r\nWILSON, JOHN.\r\n\r\nOf New London County.\r\n\r\nTried for piracy in 1723 at Newport, Rhode Island, and acquitted.\r\n\r\n\r\nWINTER, CAPTAIN CHRISTOPHER.\r\n\r\nOf New Providence Island.\r\n\r\nHe took a sloop off the coast of Jamaica, the mate on board which was one\r\nEdward England, who, on Winter's persuasion, turned pirate and soon\r\nreached the summit of his new profession.\r\n\r\nIn 1718 Winter accepted the King's offer of pardon to all pirates who\r\nsurrendered. Winter soon afterwards not only returned to piracy, but did\r\neven worse, for he surrendered to the Spanish Governor of Cuba, and turned\r\nPapist. From Cuba he carried on piracy, chiefly preying on English\r\nvessels, and made raids on the coast of Jamaica, stealing slaves, which he\r\ntook away to Cuba. The Governor of Jamaica, Sir Nicholas Laws, sent\r\nLieutenant Joseph Laws, in H.M.S. _Happy_ snow, to demand the surrender of\r\nWinter and another renegade, Nicholas Brown, but nothing resulted but an\r\nexchange of acrimonious letters between the Lieutenant and the Governor of\r\nCuba.\r\n\r\n\r\nWINTER, JOHN.\r\n\r\nOne of Gow's crew in the _Revenge_. Hanged in 1725 at Wapping.\r\n\r\n\r\nWINTER, WILLIAM, _alias_ MUSTAPHA.\r\n\r\nA renegade English sailor amongst the Algiers pirates. Taken prisoner in\r\nthe _Exchange_, on which vessel he was carpenter.\r\n\r\n\r\nWINTHROP.\r\n\r\nOne of Fly's crew. Took an active part in the mutiny aboard the\r\n_Elizabeth_. Winthrop it was who chopped off the hand of Captain Green,\r\nand in a fight with Jenkins, the mate, severed his shoulder with an axe\r\nand then threw the still living officer overboard. He was hanged at Boston\r\non July 4th, 1726.\r\n\r\n\r\nWITHERBORN, CAPTAIN FRANCIS.\r\n\r\nCaptured, with his ship, by Major Beeston and brought to Jamaica. Tried\r\nfor piracy at Port Royal, he was condemned to death, and sent a prisoner\r\nto England.\r\n\r\n\r\nWOLLERVY, CAPTAIN WILLIAM.\r\n\r\nA New England pirate who sailed in company with a Captain Henley in 1683\r\noff the Island of Elenthera. He burnt his vessel near Newport, Rhode\r\nIsland, where he and his crew disappeared with their plunder.\r\n\r\n\r\nWOOD, WILLIAM.\r\n\r\nNative of York.\r\n\r\nOne of Captain Roberts's crew. Hanged in April, 1722, at the age of 27.\r\n\r\n\r\nWORLEY, CAPTAIN.\r\n\r\nHis reign was short, lasting but six months from start to finish. He was\r\nfirst heard of in September, 1718, when he set out, in company with eight\r\nother desperadoes, from New York in a small open boat \"upon the account.\"\r\nThey were provided with a few biscuits, a dried tongue, and a keg of\r\nwater, half a dozen old muskets and some ammunition. They sailed down the\r\ncoast for 150 miles, entered the river Delaware, and rowed up to\r\nNewcastle, and there seized a shallop. The news of this enterprise was\r\nquickly spread abroad, and roused the whole coast. Going down the river\r\nagain, still in their open boat, they took another sloop belonging to a\r\nmulatto called Black Robbin. They changed into this sloop, and next day\r\nmet with another sloop from Hull, which suited their purpose better. By\r\nnow the country was much alarmed, and the Government sent out H.M.S.\r\n_Phoenix_, of twenty guns, to cruise in search of the pirates. In the\r\nmeantime the latter sailed to the Bahama Islands and took another sloop\r\nand a brigantine. Worley now commanded a tidy craft of six guns and a crew\r\nof twenty-five men, and flew a black ensign with a white death's head upon\r\nit. So far all had gone well with the pirates, but one day, when cruising\r\noff the Cape of Virginia, Worley sighted two sloops as he thought making\r\nfor the James River, but which were really armed vessels sent in search of\r\nhim. Worley stood in to cut them off, little dreaming what they really\r\nwere. The two sloops and the pirate ship all standing in together, Worley\r\nhoisted his black flag. This terrified the inhabitants of Jamestown, who\r\nthought that three pirates were about to attack them. Hurried preparations\r\nfor defence were made, when all of a sudden the people on shore were\r\nsurprised to see the supposed pirates fighting amongst themselves. No\r\nquarter was asked, and the pirates were all killed in hand-to-hand\r\nfighting except Captain Worley and one other pirate, who were captured\r\nalive but desperately wounded. The formalities were quickly got through\r\nfor trying these two men, so that next day they were hanged before death\r\nfrom their wounds could save them from their just punishment. \"Thus,\"\r\nwrites Captain Johnson, \"Worley's beginning was bold and desperate, his\r\ncourse short and prosperous, and his end bloody and disgraceful.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nWORMALL, DANIEL.\r\n\r\nMaster on the brigantine _Charles_, commanded by Captain John Quelch.\r\nAttempted to escape from Gloucester, Massachusetts, by sailing off in the\r\n_Larimore_ galley, but was followed and caught by Major Sewell and taken\r\nto Salem. Here he was kept in the town gaol until sent to Boston to be\r\ntried for piracy in June, 1704.\r\n\r\n\r\nYALLAHS, CAPTAIN, or YELLOWS. A Dutch buccaneer.\r\n\r\nIn 1671 fled from Jamaica to Campeachy, there selling his frigate to the\r\nSpanish Governor for 7,000 pieces of eight. He entered the Spanish service\r\nto cruise against the English logwood cutters, at which business he was\r\nsuccessful, taking more than a dozen of these vessels off the coast of\r\nHonduras.\r\n\r\n\r\nYEATES, CAPTAIN.\r\n\r\nIn 1718 this Carolina pirate commanded a sloop which acted as tender to\r\nCaptain Vane. When at Sullivan Island, Carolina, Yeates, finding himself\r\nmaster of a fine sloop armed with several guns and a crew of fifteen men,\r\nand with a valuable cargo of slaves aboard, slipped his anchor in the\r\nmiddle of the night and sailed away.\r\n\r\nYeates thought highly of himself as a pirate and had long resented the way\r\nVane treated him as a subordinate, and was glad to get a chance of sailing\r\non his own account. Yeates, having escaped, came to North Edisto River,\r\nsome ten leagues off Charleston. There, sending hurried word to the\r\nGovernor to ask for the Royal pardon, he surrendered himself, his crew,\r\nand two negro slaves. Yeates was pardoned, and his negroes were returned\r\nto Captain Thurston, from whom they had been stolen.\r\n\r\n\r\nZEKERMAN, ANDREW.\r\n\r\nA Dutch pirate, one of Peter M'Kinlie's gang, who murdered Captain Glass\r\nand his family on board a ship sailing from the Canary Islands to England.\r\nZekerman was the most brutal of the whole crew of mutineers.\r\n\r\nHe was hanged in chains near Dublin on December 19th, 1765.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSOME FAMOUS PIRATE SHIPS, WITH THEIR CAPTAINS\r\n\r\n  Black Joke                     Captain de Soto.\r\n  Bravo                            \"   Power.\r\n  Flying Horse                     \"   Rhoade.\r\n  Fortune                          \"   Bartholomew Roberts.\r\n  Royal Fortune                    \"   Bartholomew Roberts.\r\n  Good Fortune                     \"   Bartholomew Roberts.\r\n  Batchelor's Delight              \"   Dampier.\r\n  Delight                          \"   Spriggs.\r\n  Flying King                      \"   Sample.\r\n  Night Rambler                    \"   Cooper.\r\n  Cour Valant                      \"   La Vivon.\r\n  Most Holy Trinity                \"   Bartholomew Sharp.\r\n  Flying Dragon                    \"   Condent.\r\n  Sudden Death                     \"   Derdrake.\r\n  Scowerer                         \"   Evans.\r\n  Queen Ann's Revenge              \"   Teach.\r\n  Happy Delivery                   \"   Lowther.\r\n  Snap Dragon                      \"   Goldsmith.\r\n  Revenge                        Captains Cowley, Bonnet, Gow,\r\n                                         Phillips, and others.\r\n  Bonne Homme Richard            Captain Paul Jones.\r\n  Blessing                         \"   Brown.\r\n  New York Revenge's Revenge       \"   Cole.\r\n  Mayflower                        \"   Cox.\r\n  Childhood                        \"   Caraccioli.\r\n  Liberty                          \"   Tew.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTranscriber's notes:\r\n\r\nDespite consuming (I suspect) large amounts of rum while writing this, the\r\nauthor saved none of it for me.
