A diary kept almost uninterruptedly\r\nfrom the day I quitted home in November 1861 constituted the foundation,\r\nwhile my memory enabled me to supply additional details. It had never\r\nbeen my purpose to relate my diplomatic experiences in different parts\r\nof the world, which came finally to be spread over a period of\r\naltogether forty-five years, and I therefore confined myself to one of\r\nthe most interesting episodes in which I have been concerned. This\r\ncomprised the series of events that culminated in the restoration of the\r\ndirect rule of the ancient line of sovereigns of Japan which had\r\nremained in abeyance for over six hundred years. Such a change involved\r\nthe substitution of the comparatively modern city of Yedo, under the\r\nname of Tôkiô, for the more ancient Kiôto, which had already become the\r\ncapital long before Japan was heard of in the western world.\r\n\r\nWhen I departed from Siam in 1887 I laid the unfinished manuscript\r\naside, and did not look at it again until September 1919, when some of\r\nmy younger relations, to whom I had shown it, suggested that it ought to\r\nbe completed. This second portion is largely a transcript of my\r\njournals, supplemented from papers drawn up by me which were included in\r\nthe Confidential Print of the time and by letters to my chief Sir Harry\r\nParkes which have been published elsewhere. Letters to my mother have\r\nfurnished some particulars that were omitted from the diaries.\r\n\r\nPart of the volume may read like a repetition of a few pages from my\r\nfriend the late Lord Redesdale's \"Memories,\" for when he was engaged on\r\nthat work he borrowed some of my journals of the time we had spent\r\ntogether in Japan. But I have not referred to his volumes while writing\r\nmy own.\r\n                                                   ERNEST SATOW.\r\n    OTTERY ST MARY,\r\n        _January 1921_.\r\n\r\n

drawn to Japan by a mere accident. In my\r\neighteenth year an elder brother brought home from Mudie's Library the\r\ninteresting account of Lord Elgin's Mission to China and Japan by\r\nLawrence Oliphant, and the book having fallen to me in turn, inflamed my\r\nimagination with pictures verbal and coloured of a country where the sky\r\nwas always blue, where the sun shone perpetually, and where the whole\r\nduty of man seemed to consist in lying on a matted floor with the\r\nwindows open to the ground towards a miniature rockwork garden, in the\r\ncompany of rosy-lipped black-eyed and attentive damsels--in short, a\r\nrealised fairyland. But that I should ever have a chance of seeing these\r\nIsles of the Blest was beyond my wildest dreams. An account of Commodore\r\nPerry's expedition, which had preceded Lord Elgin's Mission, came in my\r\nway shortly afterwards, and though much more sober in its outward\r\nappearance and literary style, only served to confirm the previous\r\nimpression. I thought of nothing else from that time onwards. One day,\r\non entering the library of University College, London, where I was then\r\nstudying, I found lying on the table a notice that three nominations to\r\nstudent-interpreterships in China and Japan had been placed at the\r\ndisposition of the Dean. Here was the chance for which I had been\r\nlonging. Permission to enter myself for the competition was obtained,\r\nnot without difficulty, from my parents, and having gained the first\r\nplace in the public examination, I chose Japan. To China I never wished\r\nor intended to go. My age was sufficient by a few hours to enable me to\r\ncompete. I was formally appointed in August 1861, and quitted England\r\nfull of joyful anticipation in November of that year.\r\n\r\nOwing to the prevalence of a belief among those who then had the\r\ndirection of our affairs in Japan that a knowledge of Chinese was a\r\nnecessary preliminary to the study of Japanese, my fellow-student, R. A.\r\nJamieson, and myself were at first stationed for a few months at Peking,\r\nwhere we were joined early in 1862 by Russell Robertson, who also\r\nbelonged to the Japan establishment. I pass over our sojourn there,\r\nwhich, though not without its own interest, was not long enough for me\r\nto gain any useful knowledge of China. But I learnt a few hundred\r\nChinese characters which were of great help to me afterwards, and I even\r\nbegan the study of Manchu.\r\n\r\nOur stay at the Chinese capital was suddenly cut short by the arrival of\r\na despatch from Yedo, containing the original text of a Note from the\r\nJapanese Ministers, which it was found no Chinaman could decipher, much\r\nless understand. This was decisive of the question whether the short cut\r\nto Japanese lay through the Chinese language. I thought then, and still\r\nthink, that though an acquaintance with Chinese characters may be found\r\nuseful by the student of Japanese, it is no more indispensable than that\r\nof Latin is to a person who wishes to acquire Italian or Spanish. We\r\nwere consequently bundled off to Japan with the least possible delay.\r\n\r\nOf the eight students belonging to the China establishment then at\r\nPeking, three only are still (1885) in the service--H. J. Allen, C. T.\r\nGardner, and W. G. Stronach, each of whom attained the rank of consul in\r\n1877. They had all passed the examination at the same time as myself.\r\nThe man who came out second was \"allowed to resign\" in 1867, three are\r\ndead, and one, the best man of the whole set, and who oddly enough was\r\nlast or last but one in the examination list, passed in 1872 into the\r\nChinese Customs Service, in which he now holds one of the highest\r\nappointments. So unequal are the results obtained by even limited\r\ncompetitive examination. When the competition was afterwards thrown open\r\nto the public, the results became even more uncertain, as later\r\nexperience has shown, at least in Japan, and perhaps elsewhere.\r\n\r\nThe great fault of the system is that it takes no account of moral\r\nqualities. Whether a candidate has the manners or feelings of a\r\ngentleman cannot be ascertained from the way in which he will reproduce\r\na proposition of Euclid or translate a passage from a Greek author. It\r\ndoes not test the intellectual powers, for a stupid young man who has\r\nbeen properly coached will almost always beat the real student who has\r\nnot got the right \"tips.\" Nowadays, every candidate for a public\r\nexamination goes to a crammer, who trains him in a few months for the\r\ncontest, and enables him to bring forth forced fruit for a moment. Show\r\nme a successful examinee, and I will show you a well-coached candidate.\r\nIn the majority of cases the process disgusts the man who has undergone\r\nit, and takes away any inclination he may previously have had for study.\r\nAnd without serious study it is not possible to acquire such languages\r\nas Chinese, Siamese or Japanese. The scheme of examination is no test of\r\nthe linguistic capabilities of the men, and sometimes sends into the\r\nservice those who can no more learn to speak a foreign language than\r\nthey can fly. My own success in the examination was due to my having\r\nleft school more recently than any of the other competitors.\r\n\r\nWhile I was at Peking the whole body of students was invited to dine one\r\nevening with the Bishop of Victoria, who was stopping at the Legation in\r\nthe absence of Mr. Bruce, the Minister. The conversation fell upon the\r\neffects of Chinese studies on the intellectual powers, and the Bishop\r\ninquired of us whether we did not find that the mind was weakened by\r\nclose application to such a dry, unproductive form of learning. At\r\nleast, his own experience had been to that effect. This was a curious\r\nadmission to make, but the matter of his conversation certainly\r\ncorroborated it. I do not think any of us was candid enough to confess\r\nto a similar result in his own case.\r\n\r\nI should like to dwell longer on our life in Peking--the rides in the\r\nearly morning over the plain on the north of the city, excursions to the\r\nruins of the Summer Palace, beautiful still in its desolation, the\r\nmonasteries among the blue mountains west of the city, the magnificent\r\ntemples inside and outside the walls, the dirt and dust of the streets\r\nin wet or fine weather, the pink lotus blossoms on the lake of the\r\nmarble bridge, the beggars with their cry of _K'olien, k'olien, shang\r\ni-ko ta_, the bazaar outside the Ch'ien Men Gate, with its attractive\r\nshops, the Temple of Heaven, the view of yellow, brown and green-tiled\r\nroofs embosomed in trees as one saw them from the city wall, the carts\r\nbumping over the stone pavements worn into deep ruts, the strange\r\nEastern life that surrounded a band of boys fresh from school or college\r\nor their mothers' apron-strings, and the splendour of the newly restored\r\nbuildings of the Liang Kung Fu, occupied by the British Legation--which\r\nwill never be effaced from my memory: but there is no time. Mr,\r\nafterwards Sir Frederick, Bruce was then our Minister there, a tall man\r\nof about fifty, with a noble forehead and brown eyes, grey beard,\r\nwhiskers and moustache; altogether a beautiful appearance. The Chinese\r\nSecretary was Mr, afterwards Sir Thomas, Wade, a great Chinese scholar,\r\nto whom we looked up with awe, and who was said to be of an irascible\r\ntemper. A story was told of his visiting the Chinese Ministers with the\r\nchief, and waxing very warm in argument. The president of the Ts'ung-li\r\nYa-mên remarked: \"But, Mr. Wade, I do not observe that Mr. Bruce is so\r\nangry.\" \"D'ye hear that, Mr. Bruce, they say you're not angry.\"\r\nWhereupon Mr. Bruce, with a benevolent smile and with the most\r\ngood-tempered expression in the world, replied: \"Oh, tell them I'm in a\r\ndeuce of a rage.\"\r\n\r\nWe, that is to say Jamieson, Robertson and myself, got away early on the\r\nmorning of August 6, arriving that evening at Ho-si-wu, a town on the\r\nway, and reached Tientsin next day. Thence we took boat to Taku, where\r\nwe passed some days under the hospitable roof of the Vice-Consul Gibson.\r\nHe was later on transferred to a post in Formosa, where he got into\r\ndifficulties with the Chinese officials and called on the commander of a\r\ngunboat to bombard the Custom House, for which he was smartly\r\nreprimanded by the Foreign Office. Shortly afterwards he died, it was\r\nsaid, of a broken heart. This happened in the days when the so-called\r\n\"gun-boat\" policy was no longer in favour, and poor Gibson fell a victim\r\nto his excess of zeal.\r\n\r\nAt Shanghai Jamieson left us, to start a newspaper on terms which\r\npromised him a better future than the Consular service could offer.\r\nRobertson and I embarked in the steamer _Lancefield_, and started for\r\nJapan on September 2. The first land we sighted after leaving the coast\r\nof China was Iwô Shima, a volcanic island to the south of Kiû-shiû, and\r\non the 7th we found ourselves close to Cape Idzu in a fog. Luckily it\r\nlifted for a moment, and the captain, who was new to the coast, ordered\r\nthe ship to be put about, and we ran down among the islands. Next\r\nmorning early we were steaming over the blue waves east of Vries Island,\r\npassed the serrated wooded range of Nokogiri yama on our right and the\r\ntiny inlet of Uraga to our left, and stood across the broad bay towards\r\nYokohama. It was one of those brilliant days that are so characteristic\r\nof Japan, and as we made our way up the bay of Yedo, I thought no\r\nscenery in the world could surpass it. Irregular-shaped hills, covered\r\nwith dark-green trees, lined the whole southern coast, and above them\r\nrose into the air for 12,000 feet and more the magnificent cone of Fuji,\r\nwith scarcely a patch of snow visible. The noble ranges of Oyama and\r\nothers bounded the plain on its western side, while by way of contrast,\r\na low-lying sandy coast trended rapidly away on our right, and speedily\r\nsank below the horizon in the direction of the capital.\r\n\r\nCurious duck-shaped boats of pure unpainted wood, carrying a large\r\nfour-square sail formed of narrow strips of canvas loosely tacked\r\ntogether, crowded the surface of the sparkling waters. Now and then we\r\npassed near enough to note the sunburnt, copper-coloured skins of the\r\nfishermen, naked, with the exception of a white cloth round the loins,\r\nand sometimes a blue rag tied across the nose, so that you could just\r\nsee his eyes and chin. At last the white cliffs of Mississippi Bay\r\nbecame closer and more distinct: we rounded Treaty Point and dropped\r\nanchor on the outer edge of the shipping. After the lapse of more than a\r\nyear I had at last attained my cherished object.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER II\r\n\r\n            YOKOHAMA SOCIETY, OFFICIAL AND UNOFFICIAL (1862)\r\n\r\n\r\nTHREE years had now elapsed since the opening of the country to foreign\r\ntrade in consequence of the Treaties of 1858, and a considerable number\r\nof merchants had settled at the ports of Nagasaki and Yokohama.\r\nHakodaté, however, offered then, as now, few attractions to mercantile\r\nenterprise, and being far removed from the political centre, shared very\r\nslightly in the uneasy feeling which prevailed elsewhere. At Nagasaki\r\nmost of the territorial nobles of Western Japan had establishments\r\nwhither they sent for sale the rice and other produce received in\r\npayment of tribute from the peasants, and their retainers came into\r\nfrequent contact with foreigners, whose houses they visited for the\r\npurchase of arms, gunpowder and steamers. Some sort of friendly feeling\r\nthus sprang up, which was increased by the American missionaries who\r\ngave instruction in English to younger members of this class, and\r\nimparted to them liberal ideas which had no small influence on the\r\nsubsequent course of events. At Yokohama, however, the foreign merchants\r\nhad chiefly to do with a class of adventurers, destitute of capital and\r\nignorant of commerce. Broken contracts and fraud were by no means\r\nuncommon. Foreigners made large advances to men of straw for the\r\npurchase of merchandise which was never delivered, or ordered\r\nmanufactures from home on the account of men who, if the market fell,\r\nrefused to accept the goods that would now bring them in only a loss.\r\nRaw silk was adulterated with sand or fastened with heavy paper ties,\r\nand every separate skein had to be carefully inspected before payment,\r\nwhile the tea could not be trusted to be as good as the sample. Now and\r\nthen a Japanese dealer would get paid out in kind, but the balance of\r\nwrong-doing was greatly against the native, and the conviction that\r\nJapanese was a synonym for dishonest trader became so firmly seated in\r\nthe minds of foreigners that it was impossible for any friendly feeling\r\nto exist.\r\n\r\nThe Custom House officials were in the highest degree corrupt, and\r\ndemanded ever-increasing bribes from the foreigners who sought to elude\r\nthe import duties. One of the worst abuses was the importation of large\r\nquantities of wines, beer, spirits and stores, for which exemption from\r\nthe payment of duty was claimed as goods intended for \"personal use.\"\r\n\r\nThe local administration was carried on by a large staff of officials\r\nestablished at the Custom House. There were two Bugiô, or Governors; two\r\nKumi-gashira, or Vice-Governors; two Metsuké, whose function was that of\r\nkeeping an eye on the doings of the others; a number of Shirabé-yaku, or\r\nDirectors; and Jô-yaku, or chief clerks, besides a host of scribes,\r\ninterpreters, tidewaiters and policemen, in black or green robes. Dutch\r\nwas the common medium of communication both orally and in writing, for\r\nEnglish was as yet scarcely studied by the natives, and the foreigners\r\nwho could speak Japanese might be counted on the fingers of one hand.\r\nYet all knew a little. A sort of bastard language had been invented for\r\nthe uses of trade, in which the Malay words _peggi_ and _sarampan_\r\nplayed a great part, and with the addition of _anata_ and _arimasu_\r\nevery one fancied himself competent to settle the terms of a complicated\r\ntransaction. In this new tongue all the rich variety of Japanese speech,\r\nby which the relative social position of the speakers is indicated, and\r\nthe intricate inflexion of the verbs, were conspicuous by their absence.\r\nOutside the settlements it was of course not understood, and its use by\r\nEuropeans must have contributed not a little to the contempt for the\r\n\"barbarian\" which was characteristic of the native attitude towards\r\nforeigners.\r\n\r\nBy virtue of the treaties Kanagawa had been at first fixed upon for the\r\nresidence of Europeans, but, lying on the Tôkaidô, or principal highway\r\nbetween Yedo and Kiôto, it was only too well calculated to afford\r\noccasion for collision between the armed followers of the Japanese\r\nnobles and the foreign settlers. Early in the day the Tycoon's\r\ngovernment sought to avoid this difficulty by erecting a Custom House\r\nand rows of wooden bungalows at the fishing village of Yokohama, across\r\nthe shallow bay to the south. Some of the foreign representatives, more\r\nintent upon enforcing Treaty provisions than desirous of meeting the\r\nconvenience of the native officials and the European merchants, strongly\r\nopposed this arrangement, but the practical advantages of proximity to\r\nthe anchorage and personal security won the favour of the merchants, and\r\nYokohama became recognised as the port. Long after, and perhaps to this\r\nday, the foreign consuls continued to date their official reports from\r\nKanagawa, though they were safely ensconced at the rival site, where a\r\ntown of 100,000 inhabitants now exists, and curious stories are told of\r\nthe difference in freight that used to be earned on goods shipped from\r\nEurope to Yokohama or Kanagawa as the case might be.\r\n\r\nThe foreign settlement, for greater security, was surrounded on the land\r\nside by wide canals, across which bridges were thrown, while ingress and\r\negress were controlled by strong guards of soldiers placed there with\r\nthe double object of excluding dangerous characters and levying a tax on\r\nthe supplies introduced from the surrounding country. At first land was\r\ngiven away freely to all applicants, some of whom were employés of the\r\ndifferent consulates. These latter afterwards sold their lots to new\r\narrivals bent upon commercial pursuits, and thus pocketed gains to which\r\nthey had no shadow of a right. When further additions were afterwards\r\nmade to the \"settlement,\" precautions were taken which effectually\r\nprevented any one, whether merchant or official, from obtaining land\r\nwithout paying an adequate price. Later on, title-deeds were made out,\r\nby which the ground was conveyed to the holders, their heirs,\r\nadministrators, executors and assigns, thus creating a form of property\r\nnew to English experience, which purported to be at once real and\r\npersonal. Streets were laid out with but little thought of the general\r\nconvenience, and slight provision for the future. The day of wheeled\r\ncarriages had not dawned upon Japan. It was sufficient if space were\r\nleft for handcarts, and the most important Japanese commercial town of\r\nthe future was thus condemned in perpetuity to inconveniences of\r\ntraffic, the like of which can be best appreciated by those who knew the\r\ncentral parts of business London fifty years ago, or the successive\r\ncapitals of the Italian kingdom when they were raised to that rank.\r\nArchitectural ambition at first was contented with simple wooden\r\nbungalows, and in the latter part of 1862 there were not more than half\r\na dozen two-storied buildings in the foreign portion of the town.\r\n\r\nBehind the settlement lay a newly filled-in tract of ground known as the\r\n\"swamp,\" still unoccupied except by a racecourse track, and in the rear\r\nof this again, across a foul marsh, were conspicuous the flimsy\r\nbuildings of the Yoshiwara, euphemistically described by a noble Duke\r\nfrom his place in Parliament as an \"establishment for the education of\r\nyoung ladies,\" and where a colonial bishop, to the intense amusement of\r\nthe younger and more irreverent of the foreign community, had innocently\r\nleft his visiting-card upon the elderly female who presided over the\r\npleasures of the place. But in those days all the residents were young.\r\n\r\nTwo churches, however, had already been erected, by Catholics and\r\nProtestants respectively, and a foreign cemetery had been set apart on\r\nthe outside of the settlement. The health enjoyed by the European and\r\nAmerican inhabitants was such that the only occupants of the\r\nburial-ground were some Russian officers and two Dutch merchant\r\ncaptains, who had fallen victims to the deadly and mistaken patriotism\r\nof Japanese _samurai_ (two-sworded men). No one had yet succumbed to\r\ndisease in that beautiful sunny climate.\r\n\r\nThe foreign community of Yokohama of that day was somewhat extravagantly\r\ndescribed by an English diplomat as \"the scum of Europe.\" No doubt there\r\nwas a fair sprinkling of men who, suddenly relieved from the restraints\r\nwhich social opinion places upon their class at home, and exposed to the\r\ntemptations of Eastern life, did not conduct themselves with the strict\r\npropriety of students at a theological college. That they were really\r\nworse than their co-equals elsewhere is unlikely. But in a small\r\ncommunity, where the actions of everyone are semi-public and concealment\r\nis not regarded as an object of first-rate importance, the vices that\r\nelsewhere pass unnoticed become prominent to the eyes of those who are\r\nnot exposed to the same temptations. There were also not a few who came\r\nthere without much capital to make a livelihood, or, if possible,\r\nsomething more, and hastened to the attainment of their object without\r\nbeing troubled with much scruple. And the difficulty which soon\r\npresented itself of obtaining a sufficiency of native coin in exchange\r\nfor the silver dollar of Eastern commerce was the cause of extravagant\r\ndemands being presented to the Japanese Treasury. But the compromise\r\neventually arrived at, by which the merchant had to buy his _ichibus_ in\r\nthe open market, while the official obtained the equivalent of his\r\nsalary, and often much more, in native coin nearly weight for weight of\r\nhis \"Mexicans,\" was to the minds of all unprejudiced persons a far\r\ngreater scandal. Detractors said that the advantages thus given to\r\nMinisters, Consuls, sailors and soldiers was a bribe to induce their\r\ncompliance with violation of treaty stipulations to the prejudice of\r\ntheir non-official countrymen; but this is unfair. It was the result of\r\nfalse theories as to the nature and function of money, and personal\r\ninterest worked against a conversion to views more in accordance with\r\nthe principles of political economy.\r\n\r\nThe fact, however, remains, that in September 1862 the current rate of\r\nexchange was 214 _ichibus_ for 100 dollars, though the latter were\r\nreally exchangeable for 311 _ichibus_ according to the Treaty. Each\r\ndiplomatic or consular establishment was allowed to exchange monthly a\r\ncertain number of dollars, supposed to represent the total salaries of\r\nthe staff, and other government charges, thirteen _ichibus_ per $100\r\nbeing deducted for coinage. An official whose salary was $100 received\r\n298 _ichibus_, the surplus of which over his bazaar expenses he\r\nproceeded to change back into dollars; but practically he received\r\n$139.25, or a profit of nearly 40 per cent. The gains of a Minister\r\nwhose salary was £3000 a year it may easily be seen were very large.\r\nThis was not all. The balance of the monthly quota of _ichibus_ was then\r\nreconverted into dollars, the amount due to the official chest was\r\ndeducted, and the profit then divided among the staff in proportion to\r\ntheir salaries. On a nominally small income it was consequently possible\r\nto live well, keep a pony and drink champagne. As time went on, the\r\nnumber of _ichibus_ thus put into circulation increased, and the rate of\r\nexchange eventually declined to par. Then and only then the system was\r\nabandoned. Where the money came from that was thus transferred to the\r\npockets of officials can be best explained by those who are versed in\r\neconomical questions. For my own part, I cannot look back on that period\r\nwithout shame, and my only excuse, which is perhaps of little worth in\r\nthe court of history, is that I was at the bottom of the ladder, and\r\nreceived the proportion paid to me by those who were in charge of the\r\nbusiness.\r\n\r\nA few words may be devoted to describing the Yokohama society of those\r\ndays. There were few ladies in the settlement. Japan was a long way from\r\nEurope, with no regular steam communication, and the lives of foreigners\r\nwere supposed to be not very safe at the hands of the arm-bearing\r\nclasses. The two great China firms of Jardine, Matheson & Co. and Dent &\r\nCo. were of course represented. The latter came down with a crash a year\r\nor two after my arrival. Fletcher & Co., another important Shanghai\r\nfirm, had a branch, and so had Barnet & Co., both now long forgotten.\r\nMost of the remainder were Japan firms, amongst whom Aspinall, Cornes &\r\nCo., Macpherson, Marshall & Co., were the foremost English, and Walsh,\r\nHall & Co., the leading American firms. Germans, French and Dutch were\r\nconsidered of \"no account.\" Money was abundant, or seemed to be, every\r\none kept a pony or two, and champagne flowed freely at frequent\r\nconvivial entertainments. Races were held in the spring and autumn, and\r\n\"real\" horses competed in some of the events. A favourite Sunday's\r\nexcursion was the ride along the Tôkaidô to Kawasaki for tiffin, and\r\nback again toward evening. Longer outings were to Kanazawa, Kamakura and\r\nEnoshima; but anyone who had ventured as far as Hachiôji or Hakoné,\r\nwhich were beyond the Treaty limits, was regarded as a bold, adventurous\r\nspirit. The privilege of travelling beyond a distance of 25 miles from\r\nYokohama was reserved to the diplomatic representatives of foreign\r\npowers, and Yedo could be visited only in the disguise of a member of\r\none of the legations, with the permission of its head. Such favours were\r\nregarded with extreme jealousy by those who were debarred by\r\ncircumstances from obtaining them, and loud murmurs were heard that it\r\nwas the Minister's duty to invite his countrymen to the capital, and\r\ngive them board and lodging, irrespective of the shape which their\r\nprivate relations with him might have assumed. Then, and perhaps even\r\nyet, there existed a theory that public servants were practically the\r\nservants of the extremely small section of the public that inhabited\r\nYokohama, and when the servants failed to comply with the wishes of\r\ntheir employers they were naturally and rightly abused--behind their\r\nbacks.\r\n\r\nSo strong was the hostility excited in the breasts of the\r\nEnglish-Scotch-Irish portion of the community by the unlucky phrase,\r\n\"scum of Europe,\" that no member of either legation or consulate of\r\ntheir country was allowed admittance into the Yokohama Club, composed\r\nchiefly of British merchants; and this feeling lasted until the year\r\n1865 brought about a permanent change in the representation of Great\r\nBritain. The excuse for such relations between the British residents and\r\none who ought to have been the leader of the small society, is to be\r\nfound in the comparative youthfulness and ignorance of the world which\r\ncharacterised the former. The experience of men and manners which saves\r\nthe dwellers in Little Peddlington from believing that others are\r\ndeliberately plotting to inflict insults on them is seldom attained\r\nbefore middle life, especially when Little Peddlington happens to be\r\nlocated in an Eastern land where the mind's growth comes to a\r\nstandstill, and a man's age is virtually to be reckoned by the years\r\nactually spent in the mother country. For all purposes of mental and\r\nmoral development the time passed on the opposite side of the world must\r\nbe left out of the calculation.\r\n\r\nIt was agreed in the Treaties that Yedo should be the residence of the\r\nforeign diplomatic representatives, and four Buddhist monasteries had,\r\nin accordance with Japanese custom, been assigned to the representatives\r\nof the four chief powers--Great Britain, France, Holland and the United\r\nStates. Sir R. Alcock[1] occupied Tô-zen-ji, in the suburb of Takanawa;\r\nM. de Graef van Polsbrock lived in Chô-ô-ji, a little nearer the city;\r\nthen came Sai-kai-ji, the residence of M. Duchesne de Bellecourt; and\r\nMr. Harris had settled down at Zem-puku-ji in Azabu. But a series of\r\nalarming occurrences had caused the European portion of the diplomatic\r\nbody to transfer their quarters to Yokohama, and the American Minister\r\nalone held out, declaring his confidence in the good faith of the\r\nJapanese Government and their ability to protect him. In September of\r\n1862 he had already been replaced by General Pruyn, who followed the\r\nexample of his predecessor, until eventually driven out of the capital\r\nby a fire which destroyed his house, whether purely accidental or\r\nmaliciously contrived. The English legation in 1861 had been the object\r\nof a murderous attack in which the Secretary, Mr. Laurence Oliphant, and\r\nMr. G. C. Morrison were wounded. The assailants were principally\r\nretainers of the Daimiô of Mito, but others belonging to various clans\r\nwere concerned in the affair, and some of these are still living. Sir R.\r\nAlcock had consequently removed to Yokohama, where the strong guard\r\nplaced by the Japanese government at the entrances to the town and the\r\nforeign men-of-war in the harbour offered sufficient guarantees for\r\nsafety. On his quitting Japan for a term of leave early in 1862, his\r\nlocum-tenens, Colonel Neale, not believing in a danger of which he had\r\nno experience, brought the legation back to Tô-zen-ji. But he had no\r\nsooner installed himself there than an event occurred which led him to\r\nchange his opinion. This was nothing less than the murder of the sentry\r\nwho stood at his bedroom door and of a corporal on his rounds, at the\r\nhands of one of the Japanese guard, in revenge for an insult offered to\r\nhim, it is said, by the youngest member of the staff, a heedless boy of\r\nfifteen or sixteen. So the British Legation packed up their archives and\r\nhastened back to Yokohama, where they installed themselves in a house\r\nthat stood on the site of the present Grand Hotel. This building\r\nbelonged to an Englishman named Hoey, who was murdered in his bed in\r\n1870, apparently from motives of private revenge. The foreign consuls\r\nwere all stationed at Yokohama with the exception of the American\r\nconsul, Colonel Fisher, who remained at Kanagawa. Mr. Harris, it is\r\nsaid, would never admit that Yokohama could be rightfully substituted\r\nfor Kanagawa, the town mentioned in the Treaty, and would not permit his\r\nconsul to reside there. He even carried his opposition so far as to\r\ndeclare that he never would countenance the change of settlement, and\r\ncarried out his vow by leaving Japan without having set foot in\r\nYokohama.\r\n\r\n    [1] It would be inconvenient to observe chronological exactness\r\n        in matters of official rank or title, which in the case of\r\n        most individuals are subject to progression. I shall speak\r\n        therefore of persons by the titles they bore at the latest\r\n        portion of the period covered by these reminiscences.\r\n\r\nAt the time of my arrival there, Colonel Neale, an old warrior who had\r\nseen service with the Spanish Legion commanded by Sir de Lacy Evans, and\r\nwho, gossip said, regarded Sir R. Alcock, formerly attached to the\r\nMarine Brigade of Portugal in the quality of surgeon, with no friendly\r\nfeelings, was Secretary of Legation, and consequently chargé d'affaires\r\nin the absence of his chief. He had great command of his pen, and\r\ncomposed most drastic Notes to the Japanese Government, some of which\r\nhave been printed by my friend, Mr. F. O. Adams in his _History of\r\nJapan_. He had previously been consul at Varna and Belgrade, and\r\nconsequently had a sufficient experience of the system known as\r\n\"extra-territoriality,\" which in most non-Christian countries of the\r\nEast exempts Europeans from the operations of the local law. In stature\r\nconsiderably less than the average Englishman, he wore a heavy grey\r\nmoustache, and thin wisps of grizzled hair wandered about his forehead.\r\nHis temper was sour and suspicious. Of his political capacity there is\r\nnot much to be said, except that he did not understand the circumstances\r\namongst which he was thrown, as his despatches sufficiently indicate,\r\nwell-written and incisive as they are. But this is only an example of\r\nthe fact that power of speech with tongue or pen is not a measure of a\r\nman's fitness for the conduct of affairs. In his jovial moments he\r\neasily unbent, and would entertain his companions with snatches of\r\noperas of which he carried a large assortment in his memory.\r\n\r\nAt this period he was about fifty-five, and probably already affected\r\nwith the beginnings of the disease which carried him off a few years\r\nlater at Quito.\r\n\r\nThe second in rank was the so-called Japanese Secretary. He was neither\r\na native of Japan nor had he any knowledge of the language, so that the\r\ntitle must be understood as signifying \"secretary in charge of\r\ncorrespondence with the Japanese Government.\" At our mission in China\r\nthere is always an official who bears the corresponding title of Chinese\r\nSecretary, but there the post has always been held by a scholar. Dutch\r\nwas the only European language of which the Japanese knew anything, and\r\ntherefore when the Foreign Office came to provide a staff of officials\r\nfor the consular establishment, they sought high and low for Englishmen\r\nacquainted with that recondite tongue. Four were at last discovered, one\r\nof whom was first appointed interpreter to the legation and afterwards\r\naccorded the higher title. Part of his salary was expressly granted by\r\nway of remuneration for instructing the student-interpreters in the\r\nlanguage of the country, and consequently could not be said to be\r\nearned. He retained his office for eight years, when a consulate became\r\nvacant, and the opportunity was at once seized of \"kicking him up the\r\nladder.\" All the domestic virtues were his, and of actively bad\r\nqualities he showed no trace.\r\n\r\nNext to this gentleman came a First Assistant, sociable and\r\naccomplished, musical, artistic and speaking many languages beside his\r\nown, but no lover of hard work. In his hands the accounts fell eighteen\r\nmonths in arrear, and the registers of correspondence were a couple of\r\nyears behind hand. It was his function to preside over the chancery, and\r\nhe left it to his successor in a condition which the latter aptly\r\ncompared to that of an \"Aegean stable.\" He was the sort of man who is\r\nalways known among his friends by his Christian name, and no higher\r\ntribute to personal qualities is possible. In the course of time he\r\nbecame a consul, and retired from the service at an early age, carrying\r\nwith him the regrets and good wishes of everybody who knew him.\r\n\r\nIn the legation staff there were also included two doctors, who at the\r\nsame time discharged the functions of Assistants in the chancery. One of\r\nthem shortly quitted the service, and set up in Yokohama as a general\r\npractitioner, to retire with a competent fortune after but a few years.\r\nThe other merits more extended notice, on account both of his character\r\nand public services of every kind. I mean my life-long friend, William\r\nWillis. Perhaps no other man ever exhibited in a greater measure the\r\nquality which we are wont to call conscientiousness, whether in his\r\nprivate relations or in the discharge of his duties. Those who have had\r\nthe fortune to profit by his medical or surgical aid, feel that no man\r\ncould be more tender or sympathetic towards a patient. He was devoted to\r\nhis profession, and lost no opportunity of extending his experience. In\r\nthose days a doctor had frequently to encounter personal risks such as\r\nfall to the lot of few civilians; he exposed himself freely, in order to\r\nsuccour the wounded. In the chancery his services were indispensable. He\r\nit was who \"swept the 'Aegean stable,'\" arranged the archives in order,\r\nand brought the register up to date. Always on the spot when he was\r\nwanted, an indefatigable worker, and unswervingly loyal to his chief.\r\nAfter nine years service he was promoted to be a vice-consul, but by\r\nthis time the Japanese had become so impressed with his value as a\r\nsurgeon and physician that they begged him to accept a salary more than\r\nfour times what he received from the Foreign Office, and he went where\r\nhis great qualities were likely to be of more use than in trying petty\r\npolice cases and drawing up trade reports of a city which never had any\r\nforeign commerce. His gigantic stature made him conspicuous among all\r\nthe Europeans who have resided in Japan since the ports were opened, and\r\nwhen I first knew him he was hardly five and twenty years of age. A man\r\nendowed with an untiring power of application, accurate memory for words\r\nand things, and brimful of good stories from the three kingdoms. Big men\r\nare big-hearted, and he was no exception. We shall come across him again\r\nrepeatedly in the course of these reminiscences, and for the present\r\nthese few words must suffice.\r\n\r\nBesides these, the legation staff included Russell Brooke Robertson and\r\nmyself, as student-interpreters.\r\n\r\nLast, but not least, were the officers of the mounted escort and\r\ninfantry guard. The latter was commanded by Lieut. Price of the 67th\r\nRegiment, and was soon replaced by fifty marines under the command of a\r\nman widely known in the service to which he belonged as\r\n\"Public-spirited\" Smith. I shall say more of him later on. The cavalry\r\nescort consisted of a dozen men from the Military Train, a corps which\r\nwent by the honorary title of \"Pig-drivers,\" and at their head was a\r\nlieutenant, a good, harmless sort of fellow, whose only weakness was for\r\nfine uniforms and showy horses. Not being learned in the extremely\r\ncomplicated subject of military costume, full dress, half dress, and\r\nundress, I cannot say what it was that he had adopted for himself, but\r\nit was whispered about that he had been audacious enough to assume the\r\ninsignia of a field-officer, which is undoubtedly a serious offence\r\nagainst discipline. However that may be, the blaze of gold which\r\ndecorated his person was wonderful to behold, and on at least one\r\noccasion, when we were going in solemn procession to an audience of the\r\nTycoon, caused him to be mistaken for the Envoy by the Japanese\r\nofficials, who gave him the salutes that rightfully belonged to his less\r\nconspicuously adorned diplomatic chief. To determine whether the\r\npleasure derived from this confusion of persons by the one outweighed\r\nthe mortification which might not unnaturally have been felt by the\r\nother would have required a delicate moral balance, which was not\r\navailable at the moment; but judging from the relative scale of the two\r\nmen in other points of character, I am inclined to infer that the good\r\npreponderated largely over the evil, and that applying consequently the\r\ncriterion so unfairly attributed to the utilitarians by their opponents,\r\nwe must arrive at the provisional conclusion that the lieutenant's\r\nuniform was highly virtuous and worthy of the applause of mankind.\r\n\r\nBut it is time to quit this gossiping tone and speak of more serious\r\nmatters.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER III\r\n\r\n                     POLITICAL CONDITIONS IN JAPAN\r\n\r\n\r\nAT this period the movement had already commenced that finally\r\nculminated in what may fitly be called the Revolution of 1868, by which\r\nthe feudal system was destroyed and the old monarchical government\r\nrevived. The tendency of the times was as yet scarcely perceived by\r\nforeigners, with but one or two exceptions. They generally supposed that\r\npolitical strife had broken out between the sovereign and a few unruly\r\nvassals dissatisfied with the treaties that permitted the sacred soil of\r\nJapan to be defiled by the footsteps of \"barbarians,\" and secured all\r\nthe profits of trade to the head of the State, the vassals being enabled\r\nto defy their suzerain owing to his own feebleness and the incapacity of\r\nhis Ministers. It was still believed that the potentate in whose name\r\nthe Treaties had been concluded was the Temporal Sovereign, and that the\r\nMikado was little more than the head of the priesthood, or Spiritual\r\nEmperor. This theory of the Japanese Constitution was almost as old as\r\nthe earliest knowledge of the country possessed by Europeans. Marco\r\nPolo, indeed, says nothing of its system of government in the two short\r\nchapters which he devotes to Zipangu, but the Jesuit missionaries who\r\nlaboured in Japan during the 16th and 17th centuries uniformly held the\r\nMikado to be a spiritual dignitary, and spoke of the Shôgun as the real\r\nruler of the country, the temporal king, and even Emperor. Kaempfer, the\r\nbest known and most often quoted of the authorities on Japan, writing at\r\nthe beginning of the 18th century, calls the two potentates\r\nEcclesiastical and Secular Emperors, and his example had, up to the time\r\nI am writing of, been followed by all his successors without exception.\r\nThe truth is that the polity of the Japanese State had assumed already\r\nin the 12th century the form which it was still displaying at the\r\nbeginning of the latter half of the 19th, and institutions which could\r\nboast of such a highly respectable antiquity might well be supposed to\r\nhave taken a deep enough hold to be part and parcel of the national\r\nlife.\r\n\r\nThe history of Japan has still to be written. Native chronicles of the\r\nMikados and annals of leading families exist in abundance, but the\r\nJapanese mind is only just now beginning to emancipate itself from the\r\nthraldom of Chinese literary forms, while no European has yet attempted\r\na task which requires a training different from that of most men who\r\npursue an Eastern career. Until within the last two decades, the\r\nliterature of Japan was almost entirely unknown to Europeans, and the\r\nexisting keys to the language were ridiculously inadequate. The only\r\nhistorical works accessible to foreigners were the scanty _Annales des\r\nDairi_, translated by Titsingh with the aid of native Dutch interpreters\r\nand edited by Klaproth with a degree of bold confidence that nothing but\r\nthe position of a one-eyed man amongst the blind can give; and a set of\r\nchronological tables, translated by Hoffman for Siebold's _Nippon_. It\r\nis no wonder, therefore, if at the outset of Treaty relations, the\r\nforeign representatives were at a loss to appreciate the exact nature of\r\nthe political questions that confronted them, and were unable to\r\ndiagnose the condition of the patient whose previous history was unknown\r\nto them.\r\n\r\nTo trace in detail the development of the Japanese monarchy, from its\r\nbeginnings as a pure theocracy of foreign invaders, attracting to itself\r\nthe allegiance of a number of small tribal chieftains, the fusion of\r\nthese tribes with their conquerors into one seemingly homogeneous race,\r\nthe remodelling of the administration which followed upon the\r\nintroduction of Chinese laws and philosophy, the supplanting of the\r\nnative hero and native worship by the creed of Gautama, the rise of a\r\nmilitary caste brought about by the constant warfare with the barbarous\r\ntribes in the east and north of the country, the rivalry of the Taira\r\nand Minamoto clans, both sprung from base-born younger sons of the\r\nMikados, and the final suppression of the civil administration in the\r\nprovinces by the distribution of the country amongst the followers of\r\nthe Minamoto and their allies, would require a profound study of\r\ndocuments which no one has yet undertaken. With the appointment of\r\nYoritomo to be Commander-in-Chief the feudal system was fully\r\nestablished. The ancient official hierarchy still existed at Kiôto, but\r\nin name only, exercising no influence whatever over the conduct of\r\naffairs, and in the 14th century its functions were already so far\r\nforgotten as to become the subject of antiquarian research. The civil\r\nand penal codes borrowed from the great Empire of Eastern Asia fell into\r\ndisuse, and in part even the very traces of them perished. Martial law\r\nreigned throughout the land, half the people were converted into a huge\r\ngarrison, which the other half toiled to feed and clothe. Reading and\r\nwriting were the exclusive accomplishments of the Buddhist priesthood\r\nand of the impoverished nobles who formed the court of a Mikado shorn of\r\nall the usual attributes of a sovereign, and a deep sleep fell upon the\r\nliterary genius of the nation. The absence of danger from foreign\r\ninvasion rendered the necessity of a strong central administration\r\nunfelt, and Japan under the Shôguns assumed the aspect of Germany in the\r\nmiddle ages, the soil being divided between a multitude of petty\r\npotentates, independent in all but name, while their nominal head was\r\nlittle better than a puppet.\r\n\r\nThis state of things lasted till the second quarter of the 14th century,\r\nwhen an attempt was made under the Mikado Go-Daigo to re-establish the\r\npristine rule of the legitimate sovereigns. A civil war ensued that\r\nlasted for over fifty years, until the Ashikaga family finally\r\nestablished themselves in the office of hereditary Shôguns. Before long\r\nthey split up into two branches which quarrelled among themselves and\r\ngave opportunity for local chiefs to re-establish their independence. In\r\nthe middle of the 16th century a soldier of fortune, Ota Nobunaga by\r\nname, profited by the central position of the provinces he had acquired\r\nwith his sword to arrogate to himself the right of arbitrating between\r\nthe warlike leaders who had risen in every direction. After his\r\nassassination a still greater warrior, known most commonly by the title\r\nof Taicosama, carried on the work of pacification: every princelet who\r\nopposed his authority was in turn subdued, and he might have become the\r\nfounder of a new line of \"_maires du palais_.\" He died, however, before\r\ntime had sufficiently consolidated his position, leaving an\r\ninexperienced youth heir to his power, under the tutelage of guardians\r\nwho speedily quarrelled. The most distinguished of these was Iyéyasu,\r\nwho, besides the vast domains which he had acquired in the neighbourhood\r\nof Yedo, the modern Tôkiô, possessed all the qualities which fit a man\r\nto lead armies and rule kingdoms. He had been Taicosama's sole remaining\r\ncompetitor for power, and at the death of the latter naturally assumed\r\nthe most prominent position in the country. A couple of years sufficed\r\nfor the transference to him of all, and more than all, the authority\r\nwielded by his two predecessors. No combination against him had any\r\nchance of success. The decisive battle of Sekigahara in 1600 brought the\r\nwhole nation to his feet, and he made full use of this opportunity to\r\ncreate checks upon the _Daimiôs_ of whose fidelity he was not\r\nsufficiently assured, by grants of territories to his own friends and\r\nfollowers, a few of the older families alone being allowed to retain\r\ntheir ancient fiefs. Among these were Shimadzu in the south of Kiû-shiû,\r\nMôri in the extreme west, and Daté, Nambu and Tsugaru in the northern\r\nprovinces of the main island. His own sons received portions in Owari,\r\nKi-shiû, Mito and elsewhere. In 1616, at Iyéyasu's death 19-20ths of the\r\nwhole country was held by his adherents. Thus there arose five or six\r\nclasses of barons, as they may best be called, to render their position\r\nintelligible to the English reader. Firstly, there were the Three\r\nFamilies descended from his most favoured sons, from whom according to\r\nthe constitution established by him in case of a default of direct\r\nheirs, the successor to the Shôgunate was to be chosen (as a matter of\r\nfact resort was had only to Ki-shiû when a break in the line occurred).\r\nNext came the Related Families (_Kamon_) sprung from his younger sons,\r\nand in the third place were ranked the Lords of Provinces (_Koku-shi_).\r\nThe members of these three classes enjoyed the revenue of fiefs\r\ncomprising one or more provinces, or lands of equivalent extent. Below\r\nthem in importance were the Hereditary Servants (_fu-dai_) and\r\nBanner-men (_hatamoto_) composed as has been said before of the\r\nimmediate retainers of the Tokugawa family, and the Stranger Lords\r\n(_tozama_), relics of the former barons, who had submitted to his\r\nsupremacy and followed his banner in his last wars. The qualification of\r\na _daimiô_ was the possession of lands assessed at a production of\r\n10,000 _koku_ (=about 5 bushels) of rice and upwards. The _hatamotos_\r\nwere retainers of the Tokugawa family whose assessment was below 10,000\r\n_koku_ and above 1000. Below them came the ordinary vassals\r\n(_go-ke-nin_).\r\n\r\nThe fiefs of all classes of the _daimiôs_ were in their turn at first\r\npartitioned out among their retainers, and called _Ke-rai_ in their\r\nrelation to their immediate lords, and _bai-shin_ (arrière vassals) as\r\nbeing vassals of those who acknowledged the suzerainty of the Shôgun.\r\n_Samurai_ and _ashigaru_ denoted the two ranks of sword-bearing\r\ngentlemen and common soldiers among the retainers of the _daimiôs_. In\r\nthe end every retainer, except the _samurai_ of Satsuma, received an\r\nannual allowance of so much rice, in return for which he was bound to\r\nperform military service and appear in the field or discharge the\r\nordinary military duties required in time of peace, accompanied by\r\nfollowers proportioned in number to his income. In Satsuma the feudal\r\nsub-division of the land was carried out to the fullest extent, so that\r\nthe vassal of lowest rank held the sword in one hand and the hoe in the\r\nother. No taxes were paid by any feudal proprietor. The _koku-shi_ and\r\nother barons of equal rank ruled their provinces absolutely, levying\r\nland-tax on the farmers and imposts on internal trade as they chose.\r\nThey had further the power of life and death, subject only to the\r\nnominal condition of reporting once a year the capital sentences\r\ninflicted by their officers. The other nobles were less independent.\r\nEvery _daimiô_ had to maintain an establishment at the capital, where\r\nhis wife and children resided permanently, while the lord passed\r\nalternate years in Yedo and in his territories.\r\n\r\nOn his journeys to and fro he was accompanied by a little army of\r\nretainers, for whose accommodation inns were built at every town on the\r\nmain roads throughout the country, and the expense involved was a heavy\r\ntax on his resources. A strict system of etiquette regulated the\r\naudiences with which the _daimiôs_ were favoured on their arrival and\r\ndeparture, and prescribed the presents they were to offer as a symbol of\r\ntheir inferiority. There was little social intercourse among them, and\r\nthey lived for the most part a life of extreme seclusion surrounded by\r\nvast numbers of women and servants. A fixed number of hereditary\r\ncouncillors (_karô_ and _yônin_) checked all initiative in the\r\nadministration of their fiefs. They were brought up in complete\r\nignorance of the outer world, and the strings of government were pulled\r\nby the unseen hands of obscure functionaries who obtained their\r\nappointments by force of their personal qualities. After a few\r\ngenerations had passed the descendants of the active warriors and\r\nstatesmen of Iyéyasu's time were reduced to the state of imbecile\r\npuppets, while the hereditary principle produced a similar effect on\r\ntheir councillors. Thus arose in each daimiate a condition of things\r\nwhich may be compared to that of a Highland clan, where the ultimate\r\npower was based upon the feelings and opinions of a poor but\r\naristocratic oligarchy. This led to the surprising results of the\r\nrevolution of 1868, when the power nominally exercised by the chief\r\n_daimiôs_ came to be wielded by the more energetic and intelligent of\r\ntheir retainers, most of whom were _samurai_ of no rank or position.\r\nThese men it was who really ruled the clan, determined the policy of its\r\nhead and dictated to him the language he should use on public occasions.\r\nThe _daimiô_, it cannot be too often repeated, was a nobody; he\r\npossessed not even as much power as a constitutional sovereign of the\r\nmodern type, and his intellect, owing to his education, was nearly\r\nalways far below par. This strange political system was enabled to hold\r\ntogether solely by the isolation of the country from the outer world. As\r\nsoon as the fresh air of European thought impinged upon this framework\r\nit crumbled to ashes like an Egyptian mummy brought out of its\r\nsarcophagus.\r\n\r\nThe decline of the Mikado's power dates from the middle of the 9th\r\ncentury, when for the first time a boy of nine years ascended the throne\r\nof his ancestors. During his minority the country was governed by his\r\nfather-in-law, the chief of the ancient Fujiwara family, who contrived\r\nfor a long period to secure to themselves the power of setting up and\r\nremoving their own nominees just as suited their convenience. A similar\r\nfate befel the institution of the Shôgunate. After the murder of\r\nYoritomo's last surviving son, the country was nominally ruled by a\r\nsuccession of young princes, none of whom had emerged from the stage of\r\nboyhood when appointed, and who were deposed in turn after a few years\r\nof complete nullity, while the real heads of the government were the\r\ndescendants of Hôjô Tokimasa, Yoritomo's father-in-law. The vices of the\r\nhereditary principle in their case had again full sway, and the later\r\nHôjô were mere puppets in the hands of their principal advisers. A\r\nrevolution in favour of the Mikado overthrew this system for a short\r\ninterval, until the Shôgunate was restored for a time to reality by the\r\nfounder of the Ashikaga family. But after the lapse of a few years its\r\npower was divided between Kiôto and Kamakura, and the two heads of the\r\nfamily fell under the dominating influence of their agents the\r\n_Kwan-rei_ Uyésugi and Hosokawa.\r\n\r\nTowards the end of the Ashikaga period the Shôgun had become as much an\r\nempty name as the Mikado himself, and the country was split up among the\r\nlocal chieftains. The bad condition of the internal communications\r\nbetween the provinces and the capital probably contributed to this state\r\nof things. Iyéyasu was the first to render consolidation possible by the\r\nconstruction of good military roads. The governmental system erected by\r\nhim seemed calculated to ensure the lasting tranquillity of the country.\r\nBut the hereditary principle again reasserted its influence. The third\r\nShôgun, Iyémitsu, was a real man. Born four years after the battle of\r\nSekigahara and already twelve years of age when his grandfather died in\r\nthe year succeeding his final appearance in the battlefield, he had the\r\neducation of a soldier, and to his energy was owing the final\r\nestablishment of the Tokugawa supremacy on a solid basis. Iyéyasu and\r\nhis successor had always been in the habit of meeting the _daimiôs_ on\r\ntheir visits to Yedo outside the city. Iyémitsu received them in his\r\npalace. He gave those who would not submit to their changed position the\r\noption of returning home, and offered them three years for preparation\r\nto try the ordeal of war. Not a single one ventured to resist. But he\r\nwas succeeded by his son Iyétsuna, a boy of ten. During Iyétsuna's\r\nminority the government was carried on in his name by his Council of\r\nState, composed of Hereditary Servants (_fu-dai daimiôs_), and the\r\npersonal authority of the head of the Tokugawa family thus received its\r\nfirst serious blow. But worse than that, the office of chief councillor\r\nwas from the first confined to four baronial families, Ii, Honda,\r\nSakakibara and Sakai, and the rôjiû or ordinary councillors were\r\nlikewise _daimiôs_.\r\n\r\nOn them the hereditary principle had, in the interval between the close\r\nof the civil wars and the accession of the fourth Shôgun, produced its\r\nusual result. Nominally the heads of the administration they were\r\nwithout any will of their own, and were guided by their own hereditary\r\ncouncillors, whose strings were pulled by someone else. The real power\r\nthen fell into the hands of ministers or _bu-giô_, chosen from the\r\n_hatamoto_ or lesser vassals, and many of these were men of influence\r\nand real weight. Still with them the habit of delegating authority into\r\nthe hands of anyone of sufficient industry and energy to prefer work to\r\nidleness, was invincible, and in the end the dominions of the Tokugawa\r\nfamily came to be ruled by the _Oku go-yû-hitsu_ or private secretaries.\r\nThe machine in fact had been so skilfully constructed that a child could\r\nkeep it turning. Political stagnation was mistaken for stability.\r\n\r\nApart from one or two unsuccessful conspiracies against the government,\r\nJapan experienced during 238 years the profoundest tranquillity. She\r\nresembled the sleeping beauty in the wood, and the guardians of the\r\npublic safety had a task not more onerous than that of waving a fan to\r\nkeep the flies from disturbing the princess's slumbers. When her dreams\r\nwere interrupted by the eager and vigorous West the ancient, decrepit\r\nand wrinkled watchers were found unfit for their posts, and had to give\r\nway to men more fit to cope with the altered circumstances which\r\nsurrounded them.\r\n\r\nSocially the nation was divided into two sections by a wide gulf which\r\nit was impossible to pass. On the one hand the sword-bearing families or\r\ngentry, whose frequent poverty was compensated for by their privileges\r\nof rank, on the other the agricultural, labouring and commercial\r\nclasses; intermarriage was forbidden between the orders. The former were\r\nruled by the code of honour, offences against which were permitted to be\r\nexpiated by self-destruction, the famous _harakiri_ or disembowelment,\r\nwhile the latter were subject to a severe unwritten law enforced by\r\ncruel and frequent capital punishment. They were the obedient humble\r\nservants of the two-sworded class.\r\n\r\nJapan had already made the experiment of free intercourse with European\r\nstates in the middle of the 16th century, when the merchants and\r\nmissionaries of Portugal were welcomed in the chief ports of Kiû-shiû,\r\nand Christianity bade fair to replace the ancient native religions. They\r\nwere succeeded by the Spaniards, Dutch and English, the two latter\r\nnations confining themselves however to commerce. The gigantic\r\nmissionary undertakings of the two great English-speaking communities of\r\nthe far West were the creation of a much later time. It will be\r\nrecollected that in 1580 Spain for a time absorbed Portugal. The Roman\r\nCatholics began before long to excite the enmity of the Buddhist and\r\nShintô priesthood, whose temples they had caused to be pulled down and\r\nwhose revenues they seemed on the point of usurping. Nobunaga had\r\nfavoured them, but in the civil wars that raged at that period the\r\nprincipal patrons of the Jesuits were overthrown, and the new ruler\r\nTaicosama soon proclaimed his hostility to the strangers. Their worst\r\noffence was the refusal of a Christian girl to become his concubine.\r\nIyéyasu, a devout Buddhist, pursued the same religious policy as his\r\npredecessor in possession of the ruling power. His dislike to\r\nChristianity was stimulated by the fact that some of Hidéyori's\r\nadherents were Christians, and the young prince Hidéyori was himself\r\nknown to be on friendly terms with the missionaries. The flame was\r\nfanned by the Dutch and English, now become the hereditary political\r\nfoes of Spain, and the persecution was renewed with greater vigour than\r\never. Missionaries were sought out with eager keenness, and in the\r\ncompany of their disciples subjected to cruel tortures and the most\r\nhorrible deaths. The fury of persecution did not relax with Iyéyasu's\r\ndisappearance from the scene, and the final act of the drama was played\r\nout in the time of his grandson.\r\n\r\nAn insurrection provoked by the oppression of the local _daimiôs_ broke\r\nout in the island of Amakusa, where thousands of Christians joined the\r\nrebel flag. After a furious struggle the revolt was put an end to on the\r\n24th February, 1638, by the assault and capture of the castle of\r\nShimabara, when 37,000 people, two-thirds of whom were women and\r\nchildren, were put to the sword. It is hardly possible to read the\r\nnative accounts of this business without a feeling of choking\r\nindignation at the ruthless sacrifice of so many unfortunate creatures\r\nwho were incapable of defence, and whose only crime was their wish to\r\nserve the religion which they had chosen for their rule of life. The\r\nPortuguese were forbidden ever to set foot again in Japan. The English\r\nhad previously retired from a commercial contest in which they found\r\ntheir rivals too fortunate and too skilful, and the edict went forth\r\nthat the Dutch, who now alone remained, should thenceforth be confined\r\nto the small artificial island of Déshima, off the town of Nagasaki,\r\nwhere for the next 2-1/4 centuries they and the Chinese were permitted\r\nto carry on a restricted and constantly diminishing trade. Attempts were\r\nmade once or twice by the English, and early in the present century by\r\nthe Russians, to induce the government of Japan to relax their rule, but\r\nin vain. The only profit the world has derived from these abortive\r\nessays is the entrancing narrative of Golownin, who was taken prisoner\r\nin Yezo in connection with a descent made by Russian naval officers in\r\nrevenge for the rejection of the overtures made by the Russian envoy\r\nResanoff, perhaps the most lifelike picture of Japanese official manners\r\nthat is anywhere to be met with. No further approaches were made by any\r\nWestern Government until the United States took the matter in hand in\r\n1852.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER IV\r\n\r\n          TREATIES--ANTI-FOREIGN SPIRIT--MURDER OF FOREIGNERS\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE expedition of Commodore Perry to Loochoo and Japan was not the first\r\nenterprise of its kind that had been undertaken by the Americans. Having\r\naccomplished their own independence as the result of a contest in which\r\na few millions of half-united colonists had successfully withstood the\r\nwell-trained legions of Great Britain and her German mercenaries (though\r\nnot, it may be fairly said, without in a great measure owing their\r\nsuccess to the very efficient assistance of French armies and fleets),\r\nthey added to this memory of ancient wrongs a natural fellow-feeling for\r\nother nations who were less able to resist the might of the greatest\r\ncommercial and maritime Power the world has yet seen. While sympathising\r\nwith Eastern peoples in the defence of their independent rights, they\r\nbelieved that a conciliatory mode of treating them was at least equally\r\nwell fitted to ensure the concession of those trading privileges to\r\nwhich the Americans are not less indifferent than the English.\r\n\r\nIn 1836 they had despatched an envoy to Siam and Cochin-China, who was\r\nsuccessful in negotiating by peaceful methods a treaty of commerce with\r\nthe former state. In China, like the other western states, they had\r\nprofited by the negotiations which were the outcome of the Opium War,\r\nwithout having to incur the odium of using force or the humiliation of\r\nfinding their softer methods prove a failure in dealing with the\r\nobstinate conservatism of Chinese mandarins. For many years their eyes\r\nhad been bent upon Japan, which lay on the opposite side of the Pacific\r\nfronting their own state of California, then rising into fame as one of\r\nthe great gold-producing regions of the globe. Warned by the fate of all\r\nprevious attempts to break down the wall of seclusion that hemmed in the\r\n'country of the gods,' they resolved to make such a show of force that\r\nwith reasonable people, unfamiliar with modern artillery, might prove as\r\npowerful an argument as theories of universal brotherhood and the\r\nobligations imposed by the comity of nations. They appointed to the\r\nchief command a naval officer possessed of both tact and determination,\r\nwhose judicious use of the former qualification rendered the employ of\r\nthe second unnecessary. Probably no one was more agreeably surprised\r\nthan Commodore Perry at the comparative ease with which, on his second\r\nvisit to the Bay of Yedo, he obtained a Treaty, satisfactory enough as a\r\nbeginning. No doubt the counsels of the Dutch agent at Nagasaki were not\r\nwithout their effect, and we may also conjecture that the desire which\r\nhad already begun to manifest itself among some of the lower _Samurai_\r\nfor a wider acquaintance with the mysterious outer world was secretly\r\nshared by men in high positions. Fear alone would not have induced a\r\nhaughty government like that of the Shôguns to acquiesce in breaking\r\nthrough a law of restriction that had such a highly creditable antiquity\r\nto boast of.\r\n\r\nMost men's motives are mixed, and there was on the Japanese side no very\r\ndecided unwillingness to yield to a show of force, which the pretext of\r\nprudence would enable them to justify. England and Russia, then or\r\nshortly afterwards at war, followed in the wake of the United States.\r\nNext an American Consul-General took up his residence at Shimoda, to\r\nlook after the interests of whaling vessels, and skilfully made use of\r\nthe recent events in China to induce the Shôgun's government to extend\r\nthe concessions already granted. In 1858 the China War having been\r\napparently brought to a successful conclusion, Lord Elgin and the French\r\nAmbassador, Baron Gros, ran across to Japan and concluded treaties on\r\nthe same basis as Mr. Harris, and before long similar privileges were\r\naccorded to Holland and Russia. In 1859 the ports of Nagasaki, Hakodaté\r\nand Yokohama were thrown open to the trade of the Five Powers, and a new\r\nage was inaugurated in Japan.\r\n\r\nIt was not without opposition that the Shôgun's government had entered\r\ninto its first engagements with the United States, Great Britain and\r\nRussia. An agitation arose when the first American ships anchored in the\r\nBay of Yedo, and there were not wanting bold and rash men ready to\r\nundertake any desperate enterprise against the foreign invaders of the\r\nsacred soil of Japan. But at this time there was no leader to whom the\r\nmalcontents could turn for guidance. The Mikado was closely watched by\r\nthe Shôgun's resident at Kiôto, and the _daimiôs_ were divided among\r\nthemselves. The principal opponent was the ex-Prince of Mito, whose\r\nconstitutional duty was to support the Shôgun and aid him with his\r\ncounsels in all great national crises.\r\n\r\nDuring the presence of Commodore Perry the reigning Shôgun Iyéyoshi had\r\nfallen ill, and he died not long after the squadron had sailed. He was\r\nsucceeded by his son Iyésada, a man of 28, who does not seem to have\r\nbeen endowed with either force of character or knowledge of the world.\r\nSuch qualities are not to be expected from the kind of education which\r\nfell to the lot of Japanese princes in those days.\r\n\r\nIn view of the expected return of the American ships in the following\r\nyear, forts were constructed to guard the sea-front of the capital, and\r\nthe ex-Prince of Mito was summoned from his retirement to take the lead\r\nin preparing to resist the encroachments of foreign powers. By a curious\r\ncoincidence, this nobleman, then forty-nine years of age, was the\r\nrepresentative of a family which for years had maintained the\r\ntheoretical right of the Mikado to exercise the supreme government, and\r\nwas at the same time strongly opposed to any extension of the limited\r\nintercourse with foreign countries then permitted. Nor can it be\r\nwondered that Japan, who had so successfully protected herself from\r\nforeign aggression by a policy of rigid exclusion, and which had seen\r\nthe humiliation of China consequent upon disputes with a Western Power\r\narising out of trade questions at the very moment when she was being\r\ntorn by a civil war which owed its origin to the introduction of new\r\nreligious beliefs from the West, should have believed that the best\r\nmeans of maintaining peace at home and avoiding an unequal contest with\r\nEurope, was to adhere strictly to the traditions of the past two\r\ncenturies. But when the intrusive foreigners returned in the beginning\r\nof the following year, Japan found herself still unprepared to repel\r\nthem by force. The treaty was therefore signed, interdicting trade, but\r\npermitting whalers to obtain supplies in the three harbours of Nagasaki,\r\nHakodaté and Shimoda, and promising friendly treatment to shipwrecked\r\nsailors.\r\n\r\nWhile making these unavoidable concessions, the Japanese buoyed\r\nthemselves up with the belief that their innate superiority could enable\r\nthem easily to overcome the better equipped forces of foreign countries,\r\nwhen once they had acquired the modern arts of warfare and provided\r\nthemselves with a sufficient proportion of the ships and weapons of the\r\nnineteenth century. From that time onwards this was the central idea of\r\nJapan's foreign policy for many years, as the sequel will show. Even at\r\nthis period there were a few who would have willingly started off on\r\nthis new quest, and two Japanese actually asked Commodore Perry to give\r\nthem a passage in his flagship. They were refused, and their zeal was\r\npunished by their own government with imprisonment. The residence of Mr.\r\nHarris at Shimoda and the visit which he insisted on paying to the\r\ncapital created fresh difficulties for the advisers of the Shôgun.\r\nWritten protests were delivered by non-official members of his council,\r\nand he was obliged at last to ask the Mikado's sanction to the treaties,\r\nin order to strengthen his own position. This invocation of the Mikado's\r\nauthority may fairly be called an innovation upon ancient custom.\r\nNeither Nobunaga, Hidéyoshi nor Iyéyasu had thought it necessary to get\r\ntheir acts approved by him, and Iyéyasu granted trade privileges\r\nentirely on his own responsibility, without his right to do so ever\r\nbeing questioned. This reference to Kiôto is the first sign of the\r\ndecadence of the Shôgun's power.\r\n\r\nThe supremacy of the Mikado having been once admitted, his right to a\r\nvoice in the affairs of the country could no longer be disputed. His\r\nnobles seized the opportunity, and assumed the attitude of obstruction,\r\nwhich has always been a powerful weapon in the hands of individuals and\r\nparties. One man out of a dozen, of sufficient determination, can always\r\nforce the others to yield, when his position is legal, and cannot be\r\ndisturbed by the use of force. On the one hand, Mr. Harris pressed for a\r\nrevision of the treaty and the concession of open ports at Kanagawa and\r\nOzaka; on the other was the Court, turning an obstinately deaf ear to\r\nall proposals. In its desperation the Shôgun's government appointed to\r\nbe Prime Minister, or Regent as he was called by foreigners, the\r\ndescendant of Iyéyasu's most trusted retainer, the _daimiô_ Ii Kamon no\r\nKami of Hikoné, and Mr. Harris, as has already been said, skilfully\r\nturning to account the recent exploits of the combined English and\r\nFrench squadrons in the Chinese seas, obtained his treaty, achieving a\r\ndiplomatic triumph of the greatest value purely by the use of \"moral\"\r\npressure. The English, French, Russian and Dutch treaties followed. The\r\nShôgun stood committed to a policy from which his new allies were not\r\nlikely to allow of his receding, while to the anti-foreign party was\r\nimparted a consistency that there had previously been little chance of\r\nits acquiring.\r\n\r\nScarcely was the ink of these engagements dry, when the Shôgun, who had\r\nbeen indisposed for some weeks past, was gathered to his fathers,\r\nleaving no heir. According to the custom which had been observed on two\r\nprevious occasions when there had been a break in the direct line, a\r\nprince was chosen from the house of Ki-shiû to be his successor. The\r\nex-Prince of Mito, and several of his sympathisers among the leading\r\nnobles, namely, Hizen, Owari, Tosa, Satsuma and the Daté of Uwajima, a\r\nman of abilities superior to the size of his tiny fief in Shikoku, had\r\ndesired to choose a younger son of Mito, who had been adopted into the\r\nfamily of Hitotsubashi. But the Prime Minister was too strong for them.\r\nHe insisted on the election of his own nominee, and forced his opponents\r\nto retire into private life. Thus to their disapproval of the political\r\ncourse adopted by the Shôgunate, was added a personal resentment against\r\nits chief minister, and this feeling was shared in a remarkable degree\r\nby the retainers of the disgraced nobles. A bloody revenge was taken two\r\nyears later on the individual, but the hostility to the system only\r\nincreased with time, and in the end brought about its complete ruin.\r\n\r\nMito was the ringleader of the opposition, and began actively to\r\nintrigue with the Mikado's party against the head of his own family. The\r\nforeigners arrived in numbers at Kanagawa and Yokohama, and affronted\r\nthe feelings of the haughty _samurai_ by their independent demeanour, so\r\ndifferent from the cringing subservience to which the rules of Japanese\r\netiquette condemned the native merchant. It was not long before blood\r\nwas shed. On the evening of the 26th August, six weeks after the\r\nestablishment at Yedo of the British and American Representatives, an\r\nofficer and a seaman belonging to a Russian man-of-war were cut to\r\npieces in the streets of Yokohama, where they had landed to buy\r\nprovisions. In November, a Chinese servant belonging to the French\r\nvice-consul was attacked and killed in the foreign settlement at\r\nYokohama. Two months later, Sir R. Alcock's native linguist of the\r\nBritish Legation was stabbed from behind as he was standing at the\r\ngateway of the British Legation in Yedo, and within a month more two\r\nDutch merchant captains were slaughtered in the high street at Yokohama.\r\nThen there was a lull for eight or nine months, till the French\r\nMinister's servant was cut at and badly wounded as he was standing at\r\nthe gate of the Legation in Yedo. On the 14th January, 1861, Heusken,\r\nthe Secretary of the American Mission, was attacked and murdered as he\r\nwas riding home after a dinner-party at the Prussian Legation. And on\r\nthe night of July 5 occurred the boldest attempt yet made on the life of\r\nforeigners, when the British Legation was attacked by a band of armed\r\nmen and as stoutly defended by the native guard. This was a considerable\r\ncatalogue for a period of no more than two years since the opening of\r\nthe ports to commerce. In every case the attack was premeditated and\r\nunprovoked, and the perpetrators on every occasion belonged to the\r\nswordbearing class. No offence had been given by the victims to those\r\nwho had thus ruthlessly cut them down; they were assassinated from\r\nmotives of a political character, and their murderers went unpunished in\r\nevery instance. Japan became to be known as a country where the\r\nforeigner carried his life in his hand, and the dread of incurring the\r\nfate of which so many examples had already occurred became general among\r\nthe residents. Even in England before I left to take up my appointment,\r\nwe felt that apart from the chances of climate, the risk of coming to an\r\nuntimely end at the hands of an expert swordsman must be taken into\r\naccount. Consequently, I bought a revolver, with a due supply of powder,\r\nbullets and caps. The trade to Japan in these weapons must have been\r\nvery great in those days, as everyone wore a pistol whenever he ventured\r\nbeyond the limits of the foreign settlement, and constantly slept with\r\none under his pillow. It was a busy time for Colt and Adams. But in all\r\nthe years of my experience in Japan I never heard of more than one life\r\nbeing taken by a revolver, and that was when a Frenchman shot a\r\ncarpenter who demanded payment for his labour in a somewhat too\r\ndemonstrative manner. In Yedo I think we finally gave up wearing\r\nrevolvers in 1869, chiefly because the few of us who resided there had\r\ncome to the conclusion that the weight of the weapon was inconvenient,\r\nand also that if any bloodthirsty two-sworded gentleman intended to take\r\nour lives, he would choose his time and opportunity so as to leave us no\r\nchance of anticipating his purpose with a bullet.\r\n\r\nIn the spring of 1862 Sir Rutherford Alcock returned to England on leave\r\nof absence, and Colonel Neale was left in charge. As I have said before,\r\ndisbelieving in the validity of the reasons which had led the Minister\r\nto remove his official residence to Yokohama, the Chargé d'Affaires\r\nreestablished himself at the temple formerly occupied as the British\r\nLegation. On the anniversary, according to the Japanese calendar, of the\r\nattack referred to on a previous page, some Commissioners for Foreign\r\nAffairs in calling upon Colonel Neale, congratulated him and themselves\r\non the fact that a whole year had elapsed since any fresh attempt had\r\nbeen made on the life of a foreigner. It was not unnatural, therefore,\r\nthat in the first impulse of indignation at the savage and bloody\r\nslaughter of the sentry and corporal almost at his bedroom door, he\r\nshould have conceived the suspicion that the visit of the Commissioners\r\nand their language in the morning, had been intended to put him off his\r\nguard, and that consequently the Japanese government, or rather the\r\nShôgun's ministers, were implicated in what looked like a barbarous act\r\nof treachery that deprived the Japanese nation of all right to be\r\nregarded as a civilized community; more especially as the native watch\r\nhad been recently changed, and fresh men substituted for those who had\r\nfought so well in defence of Sir Rutherford Alcock the year before. But\r\non reflection it will easily be seen that there was no real\r\njustification for such a belief. The assassin was one of the guard.\r\nAfter the murder of the two Englishmen he returned to his quarters and\r\nthere committed suicide by ripping himself up in the approved Japanese\r\nfashion. We may be sure that if his act had been the result of a\r\nconspiracy, he would not have been alone. Ignorant as the Shôgun's\r\nministers may have been, and probably were, of the sacred character of\r\nan envoy, it was not their interest to bring upon themselves the armed\r\nvengeance of foreign powers at a moment when they were confronted with\r\nthe active enmity of the principal clans of the west. I think they may\r\nbe entirely absolved from all share in this attempt to massacre the\r\ninmates of the English Legation. But on the other hand it seems highly\r\nprobable that the man's comrades were aware of his intention, and that\r\nafter his partial success they connived at his escape. But he had been\r\nwounded by a bullet discharged from the pistol of the second man whom he\r\nattacked, and drops of blood on the ground showed the route by which he\r\nhad made his way out of the garden. As his identity could not be\r\nconcealed, he had to commit suicide in order to anticipate the penalty\r\nof death which the Shôgun's government could not have avoided inflicting\r\non him. The apparent cognisance of the other men on guard (who were what\r\nour law would call accessories before the fact), and the fact that\r\nnevertheless they took no share in his act, is consonant with the\r\nstatement that he was merely accomplishing an act of private revenge.\r\nHis selection of the darkness of night seems to indicate that he hoped\r\nto escape the consequences. Willis said that when he arose and looked\r\nout, the night was pitch dark. It was the night before full moon, and in\r\nthe very middle of what is called in Japan the rainy season. He informed\r\nme that there was a high wind and that heavy black clouds were drifting\r\nover the sky. The stormy weather and the lateness of the hour (11 to 12\r\no'clock) might perhaps account for the native lanterns which were hung\r\nabout the grounds having ceased to give any light, but even under those\r\ncircumstances it is a little suspicious that the guard should have\r\nneglected to replace the burnt out candles.\r\n\r\nIt was at Taku on our way down from Peking that Robertson, Jamieson and\r\nI heard of this new attack on the legation. I believe our feeling was\r\nrather one of regret that we had lost the opportunity of experiencing\r\none of the stirring events which we had already learnt to regard as\r\nnormally characteristic of life in Japan. It certainly did not take us\r\nby surprise, and in no way rendered the service less attractive. But\r\nJamieson had found a better opening in Shanghai, and the remaining two\r\nwent on to Yokohama as soon as they could get a passage.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER V\r\n\r\n                 RICHARDSON'S MURDER--JAPANESE STUDIES\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE day after my arrival at Yokohama I was taken over to Kanagawa and\r\nintroduced to the Rev. S. R. Brown, an American Missionary, who was then\r\nengaged in printing a work on colloquial Japanese, and to Dr J. C.\r\nHepburn, M.D., who was employed on a dictionary of the language. The\r\nformer died some years ago, but the latter is at this moment (1886)\r\nstill in Japan,[2] bringing out the third edition of his invaluable\r\nlexicon and completing the translation of the Bible on which he has been\r\noccupied for many years. In those days we had either to take a native\r\nsculling boat for an _ichibu_ across the bay to Kanagawa or ride round\r\nby the causeway, the land along which the railway now runs not having\r\nbeen filled in at that time. Natives used to cross by a public ferry\r\nboat, paying a _tempô_ (16-1/2 to the _ichibu_) a-piece, but no\r\nforeigner was ever allowed to make use of the cheaper conveyance. If he\r\nwas quick enough to catch the ferryboat before it had pushed off, and so\r\nseize a place for himself, the boatmen simply refused to stir. They\r\nremained immovable, until the intruder was tired of waiting, and\r\nabandoned the game. It was only after a residence of some years, when I\r\nhad become pretty fluent in the language and could argue the point with\r\nthe certainty of having the public on my side, that I at last succeeded\r\nin overcoming the obstinacy of the people at the boathouse who had the\r\nmonopoly of carrying foreigners. There was in those days a fixed price\r\nfor the foreigner wherever he went, arbitrarily determined without\r\nreference to the native tariff. At the theatre a foreigner had to pay an\r\n_ichibu_ for admittance, and was then thrust into the \"deaf-box,\" as the\r\ngallery seats are called, which are so far from the stage that the\r\nactors' speeches are quite indistinguishable. The best place for both\r\nseeing and hearing is the _doma_, on the area of the theatre, close in\r\nfront of the stage. On one occasion I walked into the theatre, and took\r\nmy place in one of the divisions of the _doma_, offering to pay the\r\nregular price. No, they would not take it. I must pay my _ichibu_ and go\r\nto the foreigner's box. I held out, insisting on my right as one of the\r\npublic. Did I not squat on the floor with my boots off, just like\r\nthemselves? Well then, if I would not come out of that, the curtain\r\nwould not rise. I rejoined that they might please themselves about that.\r\nIn order to annoy a single foreigner, they would deprive the rest of the\r\nspectators of the pleasure they had paid to enjoy. So I obstinately kept\r\nmy place, and in the end the manager gave way. The \"house\" was amused at\r\nthe foreigner speaking their language and getting the best of the\r\nargument, and for the rest of my time in Yokohama I had no more\r\ndifficulty in obtaining accommodation in any part of the theatre that I\r\npreferred.\r\n\r\n    [2] Dr Hepburn died in 1911.\r\n\r\nIn those days the Yokohama theatre used to begin about eleven o'clock in\r\nthe morning and keep open for twelve hours. A favourite play was the\r\n_Chiu-Shin-Gura_, or _Treasury of Faithful Retainers_, and the\r\n_Sara-Yashiki_, or the _Broken Plate Mansion_. The arrangement of the\r\ninterior, the fashion of dress and acting, the primitive character of\r\nthe scenery and lights, the literary style of the plays have not\r\nundergone any changes, and are very unlikely to be modified in any\r\nmarked degree by contact with European ideas. There is some talk now and\r\nthen of elevating the character of the stage and making the theatre a\r\nschool of morals and manners for the young, but the good people who\r\nadvocate these theories in the press have not, as far as I know,\r\nventured to put them to practical proof, and the _shibai_ will, I hope,\r\nalways continue to be what it always has been in Japan, a place of\r\namusement and distraction, where people of all ages and sizes go to\r\nenjoy themselves without caring one atom whether the incidents are\r\nprobable or proper, so long as there is enough of the tragic to call\r\nforth the tears which every natural man sheds with satisfaction on\r\nproper occasions, and of the comic by-turns to give the facial muscles a\r\nstretch in the other direction.\r\n\r\nOn the 14th September a most barbarous murder was committed on a\r\nShanghai merchant named Richardson. He, in company with a Mrs Borradaile\r\nof Hongkong, and Woodthorpe C. Clarke and Wm. Marshall both of Yokohama,\r\nwere riding along the high road between Kanagawa and Kawasaki, when they\r\nmet with a train of _daimiô's_ retainers, who bid them stand aside. They\r\npassed on at the edge of the road, until they came in sight of a\r\npalanquin, occupied by Shimadzu Saburô, father of the Prince of Satsuma.\r\nThey were now ordered to turn back, and as they were wheeling their\r\nhorses in obedience, were suddenly set upon by several armed men\r\nbelonging to the train, who hacked at them with their sharp-edged heavy\r\nswords. Richardson fell from his horse in a dying state, and the other\r\ntwo men were so severely wounded that they called out to the lady: \"Ride\r\non, we can do nothing for you.\" She got safely back to Yokohama and gave\r\nthe alarm. Everybody in the settlement who possessed a pony and a\r\nrevolver at once armed himself and galloped off towards the scene of\r\nslaughter.\r\n\r\nLieut.-Colonel Vyse, the British Consul, led off the Legation mounted\r\nescort in spite of Colonel Neale's order that they should not move until\r\nhe or their own commander gave the word. M. de Bellecourt, the French\r\nMinister, sent out his escort, consisting of a half-dozen French\r\ntroopers; Lieut. Price of the 67th Regiment marched off part of the\r\nLegation guard, accompanied by some French infantry. But amongst the\r\nfirst, perhaps the very first of all, was Dr Willis, whose high sense of\r\nthe duty cast on him by his profession rendered him absolutely fearless.\r\nPassing for a mile along the ranks of the men whose swords were reeking\r\nwith the blood of Englishmen, he rode along the high road through\r\nKanagawa, where he was joined by some three or four more Englishmen. He\r\nproceeded onwards to Namamugi, where poor Richardson's corpse was found\r\nunder the shade of a tree by the roadside. His throat had been cut as he\r\nwas lying there wounded and helpless. The body was covered with sword\r\ncuts, any one of which was sufficient to cause death. It was carried\r\nthence to the American Consulate in Kanagawa, where Clarke and Marshall\r\nhad found refuge and surgical aid at the hands of Dr Hepburn and later\r\non of Dr Jenkins, our other doctor. There was only one British\r\nman-of-war lying in the harbour, but in the course of the evening\r\nAdmiral Küper arrived in his flagship, the _Euryalus_, with the\r\ngun-vessel _Ringdove_. The excitement among the foreign mercantile\r\ncommunity was intense, for this was the first occasion on which one of\r\ntheir own number had been struck down. The Japanese sword is as sharp as\r\na razor, and inflicts fearful gashes. The Japanese had a way of cutting\r\na man to pieces rather than leave any life in him. This had a most\r\npowerful effect on the minds of Europeans, who came to look on every\r\ntwo-sworded man as a probable assassin, and if they met one in the\r\nstreet thanked God as soon as they had passed him and found themselves\r\nin safety.\r\n\r\nIt was known that Shimadzu Saburô was to lie that night at Hodogaya, a\r\npost-town scarcely two miles from Yokohama. To surround and seize him\r\nwith the united forces of all the foreign vessels in port would, in\r\ntheir opinion, have been both easy and justifiable, and viewed by the\r\nlight of our later knowledge, not only of Japanese politics but also of\r\nJapanese ideas with regard to the right of taking redress, they were not\r\nfar wrong. In the absence of any organised police or military force able\r\nto keep order among the turbulent two-sworded class it cannot be doubted\r\nthat this course would have been adopted by any Japanese clan against\r\nwhom such an offence had been committed, and the foreign nationalities\r\nin Japan were in the same position as a native clan. They were subject\r\nto the authorities of their own country, who had jurisdiction over them\r\nboth in criminal and civil matters, and were responsible for keeping\r\nthem within the bounds of law and for their protection against attack. A\r\nmeeting was called at Hooper's (W. C. Clarke's partner) house under the\r\npresidency of Colonel F. Howard Vyse, the British Consul, when, after an\r\nearnest discussion and the rejection of a motion to request the foreign\r\nnaval authorities to land 1000 men in order to arrest the guilty\r\nparties, a deputation consisting of some of the leading residents was\r\nappointed to wait on the commanding officers of the Dutch, French and\r\nEnglish naval forces and lay before them the conclusions of the meeting.\r\nThe British admiral, however, declined to act upon their suggestion, but\r\nconsented to attend another meeting which was to be held at the\r\nresidence of the French Minister at 6 a.m. on the following morning. The\r\ndeputation then went to Colonel Neale, who with great magnanimity waived\r\nall personal considerations and promised to be present also. The idea\r\nhad got abroad amongst the foreign community that Colonel Neale could\r\nnot be trusted to take the energetic measures which they considered\r\nnecessary under the circumstances. In fact, they found fault with him\r\nfor preserving the cool bearing which might be expected from a man who\r\nhad seen actual service in the field and which especially became a man\r\nin his responsible situation, and they thought that pressure could be\r\nput upon him through his colleagues and the general opinion of the other\r\nforeign representatives. But in this expectation they were disappointed.\r\nAt the meeting Colonel Neale altogether declined to authorise the\r\nadoption of measures, which, if the Tycoon's government were to be\r\nregarded as the government of the country, would have amounted virtually\r\nto making war upon Japan, and the French Minister expressed an opinion\r\nentirely coinciding with that of his colleague. Calmer counsels\r\nprevailed, and Diplomacy was left to its own resources, arrangements,\r\nhowever, being made by the naval commanders-in-chief to patrol the\r\nsettlement during the night and to station guard-boats along the\r\nsea-front to communicate with the ships in case of an alarm.\r\n\r\nLooking back now after the lapse of nearly a quarter of a century, I am\r\nstrongly disposed to the belief that Colonel Neale took the best course.\r\nThe plan of the mercantile community was bold, attractive and almost\r\nromantic. It would probably have been successful for the moment, in\r\nspite of the well-known bravery of the Satsuma _samurai_. But such an\r\nevent as the capture of a leading Japanese nobleman by foreign sailors\r\nin the dominions of the Tycoon would have been a patent demonstration of\r\nhis incapacity to defend the nation against the \"outer barbarian,\" and\r\nwould have precipitated his downfall long before it actually took place,\r\nand before there was anything in the shape of a league among the clans\r\nready to establish a new government. In all probability the country\r\nwould have become a prey to ruinous anarchy, and collisions with foreign\r\npowers would have been frequent and serious. Probably the slaughter of\r\nthe foreign community at Nagasaki would have been the immediate answer\r\nto the blow struck at Hodogaya, a joint expedition would have been sent\r\nout by England, France and Holland to fight many a bloody battle and\r\nperhaps dismember the realm of the Mikados. In the meantime the commerce\r\nfor whose sake we had come to Japan would have been killed. And how many\r\nlives of Europeans and Japanese would have been sacrificed in return for\r\nthat of Shimadzu Saburô?\r\n\r\nI was standing outside the hotel that afternoon, and on seeing the\r\nbustle of men riding past, inquired what was the cause. The reply, \"A\r\ncouple of Englishmen have been cut down in Kanagawa,\" did not shock me\r\nin the least. The accounts of such occurrences that had appeared in the\r\nEnglish press and the recent attack on the Legation of which I had heard\r\non my way from Peking had prepared me to look on the murder of a\r\nforeigner as an ordinary, every-day affair, and the horror of bleeding\r\nwounds was not sufficiently familiar to me to excite the feelings of\r\nindignation that seemed to animate every one else. I was secretly\r\nashamed of my want of sympathy. And yet, if it had been otherwise, such\r\na sudden introduction to the danger of a horrid death might have\r\nrendered me quite unfit for the career I had adopted. This habit of\r\nlooking upon assassination as part of the day's work enabled me later on\r\nto face with equanimity what most men whose sensations had not been\r\ndeadened by a moral anæsthetic would perhaps have considered serious\r\ndangers. And while everyone in my immediate surroundings was in a state\r\nof excitement, defending Vyse or abusing Colonel Neale, I quietly\r\nsettled down to my studies.\r\n\r\nIn those days the helps to the acquisition of the Japanese language were\r\nvery few. A thin pamphlet by the Rev. J. Liggins, containing a few\r\nphrases in the Nagasaki dialect, a vocabulary compiled by Wm. Medhurst,\r\nsenior, and published at Batavia many years before; Rodriguez' _Japanese\r\nGrammar_, by Landresse; a grammar by MM. Donker Curtius and Hoffmann in\r\nDutch, and a French translation of it by Léon Pagès; a translation by\r\nthe latter of part of the Japanese-Portuguese Dictionary of 1603;\r\nHoffmann's dialogues in Japanese, Dutch and English; Rosny's\r\n_Introduction à la langue Japonaise_, were about all. And but few of\r\nthese were procurable in Japan. I had left London without any books on\r\nthe language. Luckily for me, Dr S. R. Brown was just then printing his\r\n_Colloquial Japanese_, and generously allowed me to have the first few\r\nsheets as they came over at intervals from the printing office in\r\nShanghai. A Japanese reprint of Medhurst's vocabulary, which could be\r\nbought in a Japanese bookshop that stood at the corner of Benten-Dôri\r\nand Honchô Itchôme, speedily proved useless. But I had a slight\r\nacquaintance with the Chinese written characters and was the fortunate\r\npossessor of Medhurst's Chinese-English Dictionary, by whose help I\r\ncould manage to come at the meaning of a Japanese word if I got it\r\nwritten down. It was very uphill work at first, for I had no teacher,\r\nand living in a single room at the hotel, abutting too on the bowling\r\nalley, could not secure quiet. The colonel ordered us, Robertson and\r\nmyself, to attend every day at the \"office\" (we did not call it the\r\nchancery then) to ask if our services were required, and what work we\r\nhad consisted chiefly of copying despatches and interminable accounts.\r\nMy handwriting was, unfortunately for me, considered to be rather better\r\nthan the average, and I began to foresee that a larger share of clerical\r\nwork would be given to me than I liked. My theory of the duty of a\r\nstudent-interpreter was then, and still is, to learn the language first\r\nof all. I considered that this order would be a great interruption to\r\nserious work if he insisted upon it, and would take away all chances of\r\nour learning the language thoroughly. At last I summoned up courage to\r\nprotest, and I rather think my friend Willis encouraged me to do this;\r\nbut I did not gain anything by remonstrating. The colonel evidently\r\nthought I was frightfully lazy, for when I said that the office work\r\nwould interfere with my studies, he replied that it would be much worse\r\nfor both to be neglected than for one to be hindered. At first there was\r\nsome idea of renting a house for Robertson and myself, but finally the\r\nColonel decided to give us rooms at one end of the rambling two-storied\r\nbuilding that was then occupied as a Legation. It stood at the corner of\r\nthe bund and the creek, where the Grand Hotel now is, and belonged to a\r\nman named Hoey, who took advantage of my inexperience and the love of\r\nbooks he had discovered to be one of my weaknesses to sell me an\r\nimperfect copy of the _Penny Cyclopædia_ for more than a complete one\r\nwould have cost at home. I used to play bowls sometimes with Albert\r\nMarkham (of Arctic fame), who was then a lieutenant on board H.M.S.\r\n_Centaur_, and Charles Wirgman, the artist-correspondent of the\r\n_Illustrated London News_. Towards the end of October we induced the\r\ncolonel to consent to our getting two lessons a week from the Rev. S. R.\r\nBrown, and to allow us to engage a native \"teacher,\" at the public\r\nexpense. So we had to get a second, and pay for him out of our own\r\npockets. He also agreed to leave us the mornings free for study up to\r\none o'clock. A \"teacher,\" it must be understood, does not mean a man who\r\ncan \"teach.\" In those days, at Peking and in Japan also, we worked with\r\nnatives who did not understand a word of English, and the process by\r\nwhich one made out the meaning of a sentence was closely akin to that\r\nwhich Poe describes in the _Gold Beetle_ for the decyphering of a\r\ncryptograph. Through my \"boy,\" who was equally ignorant of English, I\r\ngot hold of a man who explained that he had once been a doctor, and\r\nhaving nothing to do at the moment would teach me Japanese without any\r\npay. We used to communicate at first by writing down Chinese characters.\r\nOne of his first sentences was literally \"Prince loves men, I also\r\nvenerate the prince as a master\"; prince, as I afterwards divined, being\r\nmerely a polite way of saying _you_. He said he had lots of dollars and\r\n_ichibus_ and would take nothing for his services, so I agreed with him\r\nthat he should come to my room every day from ten to one. However, he\r\nnever presented himself again after the first interview.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: SIR ERNEST SATOW\r\n    1869]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: SIR ERNEST SATOW\r\n    1903]\r\n\r\nMy \"boy\" turned out to be what I considered a great villain. I had at an\r\nearly date wanted one of the native dictionaries of Chinese characters\r\nwith the Japanese equivalents in _Katakana_. I sent him out to buy one,\r\nbut he shortly returned and said that there were none in the place, and\r\nhe must go over to Kanagawa, where he would be sure to find what I\r\nwanted. After being out the whole day, he brought me a copy which he\r\nsaid was the only one to be found and for which he charged me four\r\n_ichibus_, or nearly two dollars. This was just after my arrival, when I\r\nwas new to the place and ignorant of prices. Six weeks afterwards, being\r\nin the bookseller's shop, I asked him what was the price of the book,\r\nwhen he replied that he had asked only 1-1/2 _ichibu_. My boy had taken\r\nit away and returned next day to say that I had refused to give more\r\nthan one, which he consequently accepted. Unconscionable rascal this,\r\nnot content with less than 300 per cent. of a squeeze! I found out also\r\nthat he had kept back a large slice out of money I had paid to a\r\ncarpenter for some chairs and a table. He had to refund his illicit\r\ngains, or else to find another place.\r\n\r\nAfter a time I got my rooms at the Legation and was able to study to my\r\nheart's content. The lessons which Mr. Brown gave me were of the\r\ngreatest value. Besides hearing us repeat the sentences out of his book\r\nof _Colloquial Japanese_ and explaining the grammar, he also read with\r\nus part of the first sermon in the collection entitled _Kiu-ô Dôwa_, so\r\nthat I began to get some insight into the construction of the written\r\nlanguage. Our two teachers were Takaoka Kanamé, a physician from\r\nWakayama in Ki-shiû, and another man, whose name I forget. He was stupid\r\nand of little assistance. Early in 1863 Robertson went home on sick\r\nleave, and I had Takaoka Kanamé to myself. In those days the\r\ncorrespondence with the Japanese Government was carried on by means of\r\nDutch, the only European tongue of which anything was known. An absurd\r\nidea existed at one time that Dutch was the Court language of Japan.\r\nNothing was farther from the truth. It was studied solely by a corps of\r\ninterpreters attached to the Dutch settlement at Nagasaki, and when\r\nKanagawa and Hakodaté were opened to foreign trade, some of these\r\ninterpreters were transferred to those ports. On our side we had\r\ncollected with some difficulty a body of Dutch interpreters. They\r\nincluded three Englishmen, one Cape Dutchman, one Swiss, and one real\r\nDutchman from Holland, and they received very good pay. Of course it was\r\nmy ambition to learn to read, write, and speak Japanese, and so to\r\ndisplace these middlemen.\r\n\r\nSo Takaoka began to give me lessons in the epistolary style. He used to\r\nwrite a short letter in the running-hand, and after copying it out in\r\nsquare character, explain to me its meaning. Then I made a translation\r\nand put it away for a few days. Meanwhile I exercised myself in reading,\r\nnow one and now the other copy of the original. Afterwards I took out my\r\ntranslation and tried to put it back into Japanese from memory. The plan\r\nis one recommended by Roger Ascham and by the late George Long in a\r\npreface to his edition of the de Senectute, etc., which had been one of\r\nmy school books. Before long I had got a thorough hold of a certain\r\nnumber of phrases, which I could piece together in the form of a letter,\r\nand this was all the easier, as the epistolary style of that time\r\ndemanded the employment of a vast collection of merely complimentary\r\nphrases. I also took writing lessons from an old writing-master, whom I\r\nengaged to come to me at fixed hours. He was afflicted with a watery\r\neye, and nothing but a firm resolve to learn would ever have enabled me\r\nto endure the constant drip from the diseased orbit, which fell now on\r\nthe copy-book, now on the paper I was writing on, as he leant over it to\r\ncorrect a bad stroke, now on the table.\r\n\r\nThere are innumerable styles of caligraphy in Japan, and at that date\r\nthe _on-ye-riû_ was in fashion. I had unluckily taken up with the\r\nmercantile form of this. Several years afterwards I changed to a teacher\r\nwho wrote a very beautiful hand, but still it was _on-ye-riû_. After the\r\nrevolution of 1868 the _kara-yô_, which is more picturesque and\r\nself-willed, became the mode, and I put myself under the tuition of\r\nTakasai Tanzan, who was the teacher of several nobles, and one of the\r\nhalf dozen best in Tôkiô. But owing to this triple change of style, and\r\nalso perhaps for want of real perseverance, I never came to have a good\r\nhandwriting, nor to be able to write like a Japanese; nor did I ever\r\nacquire the power of composing in Japanese without making mistakes,\r\nthough I had almost daily practice for seven or eight years in the\r\ntranslation of official documents. Perhaps that kind of work is of\r\nitself not calculated to ensure correctness, as the translator's\r\nattention is more bent on giving a faithful rendering of the original\r\nthan on writing good Japanese. I shall have more to say at a later\r\nperiod as to the change which the Japanese written language has\r\nundergone in consequence of the imitation of European modes of\r\nexpression.\r\n\r\nThe first occasion on which my knowledge of the epistolary style was put\r\ninto requisition was in June 1863, when there came a note from one of\r\nthe Shogun's ministers, the exact wording of which was a matter of\r\nimportance. It was therefore translated three times, once from the Dutch\r\nby Eusden, by Siebold with the aid of his teacher from the original\r\nJapanese, and by myself. I shall never forget the sympathetic joy of my\r\ndear Willis when I produced mine. There was no one who could say which\r\nof the three was the most faithful rendering, but in his mind and my own\r\nthere was, of course, no doubt. I think I had sometime previously\r\ntranslated a private letter from a Japanese to one of our colleagues who\r\nhad left Yokohama; it must have been done with great literalness, for I\r\nrecollect that _sessha_ was rendered \"I, the shabby one.\" But it could\r\nnot be made use of officially to testify to my progress in the language.\r\n\r\nAfter the Richardson affair the Tycoon's government erected guardhouses\r\nall along the Tôkaidô within Treaty limits, and even proposed to divert\r\nthe trains of the _daimiôs_ to another route which ran through the town\r\nof Atsugi, but this project fell through. Foreigners were in the habit\r\nof using it for their excursions, but Robertson and I had to pass along\r\nit twice a week on our way to and from our Japanese lesson at Mr.\r\nBrown's, and though determined not to show the white feather, I always\r\nfelt in passing one of these trains that my life was in peril. On one\r\noccasion as I was riding on the Tôkaidô for my pleasure, I met a tall\r\nfellow armed with the usual two swords, who made a step towards me in\r\nwhat I thought was a threatening manner, and having no pistol with me, I\r\nwas rather alarmed, but he passed on, content probably with having\r\nfrightened a foreigner. That is the only instance I can recollect of\r\neven seeming intention on the part of a _samurai_ to do me harm on a\r\nchance meeting in the street, and the general belief in the bloodthirsty\r\ncharacter of that class, in my opinion, was to a very great extent\r\nwithout foundation. But it must be admitted that whenever a Japanese\r\nmade up his mind to shed the blood of a foreigner, he took care to do\r\nhis business pretty effectually.\r\n\r\nMy first experience of an earthquake was on the 2nd November of this\r\nyear. It was said by the foreign residents to have been a rather severe\r\none. The house shook considerably, as if some very heavy person were\r\nwalking in list slippers along the verandah and passages. It lasted\r\nseveral seconds, dying away gradually, and gave me a slight sensation of\r\nsickness, insomuch that I was beginning to fancy that a shaking which\r\nlasted so long must arise from within myself. I believe the sensations\r\nof most persons on experiencing a slight shock of earthquake for the\r\nfirst time are very similar. It is usually held that familiarity with\r\nthese phenomena does not breed contempt for them, but on the contrary\r\npersons who have resided longest in Japan are the most nervous about the\r\ndanger. And there is a reason for this. We know that in not very recent\r\ntimes extremely violent shocks have occurred, throwing down houses,\r\nsplitting the earth, and causing death to thousands of people in a few\r\nmoments. The longer the interval that has elapsed since the last, the\r\nsooner may its re-occurrence be looked for. We have escaped many times,\r\nbut the next will be perhaps our last. So we feel on each occasion, and\r\nthe anticipation of harm becomes stronger and stronger, and where we at\r\nfirst used to sit calmly through a somewhat prolonged vibration, the\r\nwooden joints of the house harshly creaking and the crockery rattling\r\nmerrily on the shelves, we now spring from our chairs and rush for the\r\ndoor at the slightest movement.\r\n\r\nMy experiences in Japan of an exciting kind were pretty numerous, but, I\r\nregret to say, never included a really serious earthquake, and those who\r\ncare to read more about the insignificant specimens that the country\r\nproduces now-a-days must be referred to the pages of the Seismological\r\nSociety's Journal and other publications of the distinguished geologist,\r\nmy friend Professor John Milne, who has not only recorded observations\r\non a large number of natural earthquakes, but has even succeeded in\r\nproducing artificial ones so closely resembling the real thing as almost\r\nto defy detection.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER VI\r\n\r\n                         OFFICIAL VISIT TO YEDO\r\n\r\n\r\nDURING the later months of 1862 a good deal of correspondence went\r\nforward about the Itô Gumpei (murderer of the sentry and of the\r\ncorporal) affair and the Richardson murder, and Colonel Neale held\r\nvarious conferences with the Shôgun's ministers. The diplomatic history\r\nof these proceedings has been already recounted by Sir Francis Adams,\r\nand as for the most part I knew little of what was going on, it need not\r\nbe repeated here. The meeting-place for the more important discussions\r\nwas Yedo, whither the Colonel used to proceed with his escort and the\r\nlarger portion of the Legation staff. Some went by a gunboat, others\r\nrode up to the capital along the Tôkaidô. At that period and for several\r\nyears after, the privilege of visiting Yedo was by Treaty restricted to\r\nthe foreign diplomatic representatives, and non-official foreigners\r\ncould not cross the Rokugô ferry, half way between Kanagawa and Yedo,\r\nexcept as the invited guest of one of the legations. And now all the\r\nforeign ministers had transferred their residences to Yokohama in\r\nconsequence of the danger which menaced them at Yedo. We younger\r\nmembers, therefore, appreciated highly our opportunities, and it was\r\nwith intense delight that I found myself ordered to accompany the chief\r\nearly in December on one of his periodical expeditions thither. We\r\nstarted on horseback about one o'clock in the afternoon in solemn\r\nprocession, the party consisting of Colonel Neale, A von Siebold,\r\nRussell Robertson, and myself, with Lieutenant Applin commanding the\r\nmounted escort. It was a miserably cold day, but R. and I combated the\r\ntemperature by dropping behind to visit Mr. Brown on our way through\r\nKanagawa, and then galloping on after the others. They had evidently\r\nbeen going at a foot's pace during the interval. At Kawasaki we\r\nencountered an obstruction in the shape of an obstinate head ferryman,\r\nwho did not recognize the British Chargé d'Affaires, and refused to pass\r\nus over. The men on guard at the watch-house commanding the ferry, on\r\nseeing some of us approach to demand their assistance, ran away. The\r\nColonel fumed with wrath, but fortunately at this moment there arrived\r\nin breathless haste a mounted officer from Kanagawa, who had followed us\r\nof his own accord on hearing that the English Chargé d'Affaires had\r\npassed without a Japanese escort. So the ferryman collected his men, and\r\nwe got over without further trouble. A couple of miles beyond the river\r\nwe came to the well-known gardens called _Mmé Yashiki_, the\r\nplum-orchard, where we were waited on by some very pretty girls.\r\nEverybody who travelled along the Tôkaidô in those days, who had any\r\nrespect for himself, used to stop here, in season or out of season, to\r\ndrink a cup of straw-coloured tea, smoke a pipe and chaff the\r\nwaiting-maids. Fish cooked in various ways and warm _saké_ (rice beer)\r\nwere also procurable, and red-faced native gentlemen might often be seen\r\nfolding themselves up into their palanquins after a mild daylight\r\ndebauch. Europeans usually brought picnic baskets and lunched there, but\r\neven if they started late were glad of any excuse for turning in to this\r\ncharmingly picturesque tea-garden. Everyone now-a-days is familiar with\r\nthe Japanese plum-tree as it is represented in the myriad works of art\r\nof these ingenious people, but you must see the thing itself to\r\nunderstand what a joyful surprise it is to enter the black-paled\r\nenclosure crowded with the oddly angular trees, utterly leafless but\r\ncovered with delicate pink or white blossoms which emit a faint\r\nfragrance, and cover the ground with the snow of their fallen petals. It\r\nis early in February that they are in their glory, on a calm day when\r\nthe sun shines with its usual brilliance at that season, while in every\r\nshady corner you may find the ground frozen as hard as a stone. But to\r\nmy taste the plum-blossom looks better on a cloudy day against a dull\r\nbackground of cryptomeria when you sit by a warm fire and gaze on it out\r\nof window. In December, however, only the swelling buds are to be seen\r\nstretching along the slender shoots of last spring. We proceeded on our\r\nway without any special incident until we reached the notorious suburb\r\nof Shinagawa, half consisting of houses, or rather palaces, of ill-fame,\r\nwhere a drunken fellow who stood in the middle of the road and shouted\r\nat us got a fall from one of the troopers, and so we reached the\r\nLegation about sunset. The rest of the staff and the infantry guard, who\r\nhad come by sea, landed about an hour later.\r\n\r\nThe building occupied as the legation was part of a Buddhist temple,\r\nTô-zen-ji, behind which lay a large cemetery. But our part of it had\r\nnever been devoted to purposes of worship. Every large temple in Japan\r\nhas attached to it a suite of what we might call state apartments, which\r\nare used only on ceremonial occasions once or twice in the year, but\r\nfrom time immemorial it has been the custom to accommodate foreign\r\nembassies in these buildings. A suitable residence for a foreign\r\nrepresentative could not otherwise have been found in Yedo. As a general\r\nrule every Japanese, with the exception of the working classes, lives in\r\nhis own house, instead of renting it as do most residents in an European\r\ncapital. The only purely secular buildings large enough to lodge the\r\nBritish Minister and his staff were the _Yashiki_ or \"hotels\" of\r\n_Daimiôs_, but the idea of expropriating one of these nobles in order to\r\naccommodate a foreign official was probably never mooted. There\r\nremained, therefore, only the \"state apartments\" of some large monastery\r\nas a temporary residence until a site could be obtained and the\r\nnecessary buildings constructed. Consequently there was no ground for\r\nthe reproach which one writer at least has urged against the foreign\r\nministers, that by turning sacred edifices into dwelling-houses they had\r\ninsulted the religious feelings of the Japanese people. In the early\r\nyears of our intercourse with Japan it is true that we were regarded as\r\nunwelcome \"intruders,\" but in native opinion we \"polluted\" the temples\r\nby our presence no more than we should have \"polluted\" any other\r\nresidence that might have been assigned to us. Tô-zen-ji lay in the\r\nsuburb of Takanawa fronting the seashore, and was therefore conveniently\r\nsituated for communication with our ships, the smallest of which could\r\nanchor just inside the forts, at a distance of perhaps a mile and a\r\nhalf. Owing, however, to the shallowness of the bay, boats were unable\r\nto get up to the landing place at low tide, and the assistance which\r\ncould have been rendered by a gunboat in the event of a sudden attack,\r\nsuch as had been experienced in 1861, was absolutely _nil_. There\r\nremained, however, the comfort derived from knowing that a refuge lay at\r\nno great distance, and no doubt the appearance of a gunboat within the\r\nline of forts that had been built to keep out foreign fleets produced a\r\nconsiderable moral effect upon the general population, though\r\ndesperadoes of the sort that assaulted the guard in July 1861 would\r\ncertainly have been no whit deterred by any number of threatening\r\nmen-of-war which could not reach them. Behind the house there was a\r\nsmall ornamental garden with an artificial pond for gold fish, on the\r\nopposite side of which rose a hill covered with pine-trees. A good way\r\noff from the quarters of the minister, and at the back of the cemetery\r\nbelonging to the temple, there was a small house named Jô-tô-an, which\r\nwas occupied by the senior chancery assistant. A tall bamboo fence cut\r\nus off entirely from this part of the grounds, and joined the house at\r\neither end. The rooms were not spacious, and very little attempt had\r\nbeen made to convert them into comfortable apartments. I think there was\r\nan iron stove or two in the principal rooms, but elsewhere the only\r\nmeans of warming was a Japanese brasier piled up with red hot charcoal,\r\nthe exhalations from which were very disagreeable to a novice. The\r\nnative who wraps himself up in thick wadded clothes and squats on the\r\nfloor has no difficulty in keeping himself warm with the aid of this\r\narrangement, over which he holds the tips of his fingers. His legs being\r\ncrumpled up under him, the superficies he presents to the cold air is\r\nmuch less than it would be if he sat in a chair with outstretched limbs\r\nin European fashion. To protect himself against draughts he has a screen\r\nstanding behind him, and squats on a warm cushion stuffed with silk\r\nwool. These arrangements enable him even in winter to sit with the\r\nwindow open, so long as it has a southern aspect, and foreigners who\r\nadopt the same system have made shift to get on. But if you are going to\r\nlive in Japan in European style, you must, in order to be moderately\r\nwarm during the winter months, replace the paper of the outer wooden\r\nslides with glass, stop up the openwork above the grooves in which the\r\nslides work that divide the rooms, and either build a fireplace or put\r\nup an American stove. But even all this will not make you thoroughly\r\ncomfortable. Underneath you there are thick straw mats laid upon thin\r\nand badly jointed boarding, through which the cutting north-west wind\r\nrises all over the floor, while the keen draughts pierce through between\r\nthe uprights and the shrunken lath-and-plaster walls. The unsuitability\r\nof such a building as a residence for the minister and his staff had\r\nbeen perceived from the outset, and long negotiations, having for their\r\nobject the erection of a permanent legation, had by this time resulted\r\nin the assignment of an excellent site, on which a complete series of\r\nbuildings was being constructed from English designs, but at the expense\r\nof the Shôgun's government. Other sites in the immediate vicinity had\r\nbeen given to the French, Dutch and Americans for the same purpose. All\r\nthese were carved out of what had been once a favourite pleasure resort\r\nof the people of Yedo, whither in the spring all classes flocked to\r\npicnic under the blossoms of the cherry-trees in sight of the blue\r\nwaters of the bay. Gotenyama was indeed a famous spot in the history of\r\nthe Shôgunate. In its early days the head of the State was wont to go\r\nforth thither to meet the great _daimiôs_ on their annual entry into\r\nYedo, until Iyémitsu, the third of the line, to mark still more strongly\r\nthe supremacy to which he felt he could safely lay claim, resolved that\r\nhenceforward he would receive them in his castle, just like the rest of\r\nhis vassals. From that time the gardens had been dedicated to the public\r\nuse. But already before the foreign diplomats took up their abode in\r\nYedo, Gotenyama had been partially diverted from its original purpose,\r\nand vast masses of earth had been carried off to form part of the line\r\nof forts from Shinagawa to the other side of the junk channel that leads\r\ninto the river. The British minister's residence, a large two-storied\r\nhouse, which from a distance seemed to be two, stood on an eminence\r\nfronting the sea. Magnificent timbers had been employed in its\r\nconstruction, and the rooms were of palatial dimensions. The floors were\r\nlacquered, and the walls covered with a tastefully designed Japanese\r\npaper. Behind and below it a bungalow had been erected for the Japanese\r\nsecretary, and a site had been chosen for a second, destined for the\r\nassistants and students. On the southern side of the compound was an\r\nimmense range of stables containing stalls for 40 horses, and on the\r\nsecond storey quarters for a portion of the European guard. Some slight\r\nprogress had been made with the buildings for the French and Dutch\r\nlegations. But we knew that the people disliked our presence there. The\r\nofficial and military class objected to the foreigner being permitted to\r\noccupy such a commanding position overlooking the rear of the forts, and\r\nthe populace resented the conversion of their former pleasure-ground\r\ninto a home for the \"outer barbarians.\" To press on the completion of\r\nthe houses and to take possession was rightly considered an important\r\nmatter of policy. A deep trench was being dug round the enclosure, and a\r\nlofty wooden palisade was built on the inner margin, which, it was\r\nexpected, would afford sufficient protection against a repetition of\r\nsuch attacks as that of the 5th July 1861, and the British ensign was to\r\nbe hoisted again in Yedo as soon as the buildings should be ready for\r\noccupation. We all looked forward to that event with the liveliest\r\nfeelings of anticipation, and for myself I anxiously expected its\r\narrival because Yokohama was a hybrid sort of town, that by no means\r\nfulfilled my expectations, and I hoped before long to become a resident\r\nof the famous city to which I had looked with longing eyes from the\r\nother side of Europe.\r\n\r\nWe rode daily in the environs of Yedo, to the pretty tea-house at Oji,\r\nwhich is depicted with such bright colours in Laurence Oliphant's book,\r\nto the pond of Jiû-ni-sô on the road to Kô-shiû, to the other pond\r\ncalled Senzoku half way to Mariko, and to the temple of Fudô at Meguro,\r\nwhere the pretty damsels at the tea-houses formed more than half the\r\nattraction. Within the city we made excursions to the temple of Kwannon\r\nat Asakusa, then and for long afterwards the principal sight of interest\r\nto the foreign visitor, to Atagoyama, where other pretty damsels served\r\na decoction of salted cherry-blossoms, and to the temple of Kanda Miôjin\r\nfor the view over the city. But the gorgeous mausoleums of the Shôguns\r\nat Shiba and Uyeno were closed to the foreigner, and remained so up to\r\nthe revolution of 1868. We were allowed in riding back from Asakusa to\r\ncatch a passing glimpse of the lotus pond Shinobazu-no-iké, which is now\r\nsurrounded by a racecourse after the European manner, but the Fukiagé\r\nPark, since known as the Mikado's garden, and the short cut through the\r\ncastle from the Sakurada Gate to the Wadagura Gate of the inner circle\r\nwere shut to us in common with the Japanese public. A large portion of\r\nthe city in the immediate neighbourhood of the castle, and large areas\r\nin every quarter were occupied by the _Yashiki_ of _Daimiôs_ and\r\n_Hatamotos_, of which little could be seen but long two-storied rows of\r\nstern barrack-buildings surrounding the residence of the owner. From the\r\ntop of Atagoyama alone was it possible to get a view of the interior of\r\nsuch enclosures, and it must be admitted that the knowledge thus gained\r\ncompletely upset the idea that the nobles lived in palaces. Irregular\r\nmasses of low brown roofs and black weather-boarded walls alone were\r\nvisible. The use of telescopes was strictly forbidden on Atagoyama, lest\r\nthe people should pry into the domestic doings of their masters.\r\nWherever we went a band of mounted guards surrounded us, ostensibly for\r\nour protection, but also for the purpose of preventing free\r\ncommunication with the people. These men belonged to a force raised by\r\nthe Shôgun's ministers from the younger sons of the _hatamotos_, and\r\nnumbered 1000 or 1200. They wore the customary pair of swords (_i.e._ a\r\nlong and short sabre thrust through the belt on the left side), a round\r\nflat hat woven from the tendrils of the wistaria, for the rank and file,\r\nand a mound-shaped lacquered wooden hat for the officers, a mantle or\r\n_haori_, and the wide petticoat-shaped trousers called _hakama_. Between\r\nthem and the members of the foreign legations there existed no tie of\r\nany kind, for they were changed every fifteen days just like so many\r\npolicemen, and mounted guard indifferently at all the legations. It was\r\nnot until 1867 that I managed to break through this rule and get a\r\nspecial body of men attached to myself. Small guardhouses were dotted\r\nabout the legation grounds for their accommodation. As soon as it became\r\nknown that a foreigner was about to go out on foot or on horseback,\r\nhalf-a-dozen were detailed to follow him at all hazards. It was\r\nimpossible to escape their vigilance. They were to prevent our speaking\r\nto any person above the rank of a common citizen or to enter a private\r\nhouse. On one occasion two members of our legation managed a visit to\r\nthe father of a young _samurai_ named Kotarô, who lived with us to study\r\nEnglish. The fact was reported, and when the visitors went a second time\r\nthey found the occupants of the house had removed to another part of the\r\ncity. We were allowed to sit down in shops, and even to bargain for\r\narticles that took our fancy; but two kind of purchases were strictly\r\nprohibited, maps and the official list of _daimiôs_ and government\r\nofficials. Anything we bought had to be sent afterwards to the legation,\r\nand delivered to the officials of the foreign department who lived\r\nwithin our gates, and payment was made to them. On one occasion the\r\nPrussian representative, Herr Max von Brandt, made a determined stand\r\nagainst this prohibition. Entering the shop of the bookseller Okada-ya\r\nin Shimmei Maye, where we foreigners were in the habit of buying books,\r\nhe inquired for the List of Daimiôs. The bookseller replied that he had\r\nit not in stock. Herr von Brandt knew that he had, and announced his\r\nintention of remaining there until he was furnished with what he\r\nrequired. He sent a member of his party home to the Legation to bring\r\nout the materials for luncheon, and sat determinedly down in the shop.\r\nThe guards were at their wits' end. At last they dispatched a messenger\r\nto the castle to represent the impossibility of inducing him to give\r\nway, and at last towards evening there came an order to say that for\r\nthis once the foreigner was to have the book. So the day was won. As a\r\nmatter of fact, however, it was never necessary to proceed to this\r\nextremity, as we could easily procure what we wanted in the way of maps\r\nand printed books through our Japanese teachers. MSS. were always a\r\ndifficulty. As nothing could be published without permission, any book\r\nthat touched upon governmental matters had from of old to be circulated\r\nin MS. Amongst such works were the so-called \"Hundred Laws of Iyéyasu,\"\r\nwhich were supposed to embody the constitution of the Japanese\r\ngovernment. The book contains references to offices of state that were\r\ninstituted after his time, and the utmost that can be alleged in its\r\nfavour is that it perhaps contains a few maxims from his lips and\r\ncertain rules as to the appointment of high political functionaries that\r\nwere observed in actual practice. There was another book, of undoubted\r\nauthenticity, containing a vast mass of administrative regulations, of\r\nwhich I never obtained a copy until after the revolution, when it was no\r\nlonger of practical value. That MS. is now in the British Museum.\r\nAnother expedient for eluding the censorate was printing forbidden books\r\nwith moveable types. It was frequently resorted to during the last years\r\nof the Shôgunate and at the beginning of the new rule of the Mikado,\r\nespecially for narratives of political events during that period and for\r\none or two important treatises on politics. Shimmei Maye was one of our\r\nfavourite resorts in those days; here were to be had cheap swords,\r\nporcelain, coloured prints, picture-books and novels. I much regret that\r\nI did not then begin to collect, when the blocks were comparatively\r\nfresh; a complete set of Hokusai's Mangwa, in perfect condition, could\r\nbe had for a couple of dollars, and his Hundred Views of Fuji for about\r\na couple of shillings. But I had little spare cash for such luxuries,\r\nand all my money went in necessaries.\r\n\r\nTwo days after our arrival in Yedo we paid a visit to the Gorôjiû, or\r\nShôgun's Council. The word means \"August Elders.\" It was somewhat _infra\r\ndig._ for a foreign representative to use the prefix _go_ in speaking of\r\nthem, but the phrase had been caught up from the Japanese who surrounded\r\nthe minister, and for a long time I believe it was thought that _go_\r\nmeant five. I unveiled the mistake, and when I afterwards became\r\ninterpreter to the Legation we adopted the practice of giving them the\r\nbare _rôjiû_, except in addressing them direct, when etiquette demanded\r\nthe honorific. I was unprovided with anything in the shape of uniform,\r\nand had to borrow a gold-laced forage cap from Applin. We came\r\nafterwards to look with much contempt on these gauds, and to speak\r\nderisively of \"brass caps,\" but in 1862 I was young enough to take\r\nconsiderable pride in a distinctive mark of rank, and after this\r\noccasion lost no time in buying a bit of broad gold lace to wear like my\r\nfellow officers. It was an imposing procession, consisting as it did of\r\nhalf-a-dozen \"brass caps,\" the military train escort of twelve men under\r\ntheir gorgeous lieutenant, and a flock of about forty Japanese guards\r\nhovering about us before, behind, and on either flank. In these days a\r\nforeign representative may often be detected approaching the office of\r\nthe minister for foreign affairs without any suite, and in the humble\r\n_jinrikisha_ drawn by one scantily clad coolie. The interview took place\r\nin a long room in the house of one of the _rôjiû_. A row of small\r\nblack-lacquered tables extended down each side, and chairs were set for\r\nthe Japanese as well as the foreigners. On each table stood an earthen\r\nbrasier, a black-lacquered smoking-stand, with brass fire-pot and\r\nash-pit, and two long pipes, with a supply of finely cut tobacco in a\r\nneat black box. Three of the ministers sat on the right side of the\r\nroom, and with them an _ometsuké_, whose title was explained to me to\r\nmean spy. I suppose \"censor\" or \"reporter\" would be nearer. Below them\r\nsat eight _gai-koku bu-giô_, or commissioners for foreign affairs. We\r\nused to call them governors of foreign affairs, probably because the\r\ngovernor of Kanagawa was also a _bu-giô_. In the centre of the room sat\r\na \"governor\" on a stool, while two interpreters (one of whom was\r\nMoriyama Takichirô) squatted on the floor. The four higher Japanese\r\nofficers alone were provided with tables and chairs, the \"governors\"\r\nsitting on square stools, with their hands in the plackets of their\r\ntrousers. After some complimentary talk about the weather and health,\r\nwhich are _de rigueur_ in Japan, a double row of attendants in light\r\nblue hempen robes (we used to term the upper part \"wings\") came in\r\nbearing aloft black lacquer boxes full of slices of sponge cake and\r\n_yôkan_ (a sweetened bean paste), and afterwards oranges and persimmons.\r\nThen tea was served in two manners, simply infused, and also the\r\npowdered leaf mixed up with hot water and frothed. The conversation\r\nproceeded at a very slow pace, as it had to be transmitted through two\r\ninterpreters, ours who spoke Dutch and English, and theirs who spoke\r\nJapanese and Dutch. This gave rise to misunderstandings, and the\r\nJapanese ministers seemed every now and then to profit by this double\r\nobstruction to answer very much from the purpose, so that Colonel\r\nNeale's observations had to be repeated all over again, interpreted and\r\nre-interpreted. Often the ministers would seem at a loss, whereupon one\r\nof the \"governors\" would leave his stool and glide up to whisper\r\nsomething in his ear. This proceeding reminded one of the flappers in\r\nLaputa. The principal topic was the murder of the sentry and corporal\r\nat Tô-zen-ji which has already been related. To all the demands made by\r\nColonel Neale, in accordance with the instructions he had received from\r\nLord Russell, the _rôjiû_ objected, and when he informed them that the\r\nBritish Government required the payment of £10,000 in gold as an\r\nindemnity to the families of the two murdered men, they opened their\r\neyes very wide indeed. They offered $3000. Colonel Neale at last lost\r\nall patience, which no doubt was what they were aiming at. He gave them\r\na piece of his mind in pretty strong language, and the interview came to\r\nan end, after, I suppose, a sitting of about three hours length, without\r\nanything having been settled. I forget whether it was on this occasion\r\nthat Siebold literally translated the epithet \"son of a gun\" by _teppô\r\nno musuko_; the adjective that preceded it he did not attempt to\r\ntranslate, as it has not even a literal equivalent in Japanese. The way\r\nin which the ministers contradicted themselves from time to time was\r\nsomething wonderful, and the application of the good unmistakeable\r\nAnglo-Saxon word for him who \"says the thing that is not,\" was almost\r\nvenial.\r\n\r\nOf course Colonel Neale did not omit to complain of the ferryman and the\r\nguards at Kawasaki, who had run away instead of putting us over the\r\nriver, and Eusden in translating used the words _zij sloopen alle weg_,\r\nwhich excited my risible muscles kept at too great a stretch through\r\nthese tedious hours. I whispered to my neighbour, \"they all sloped\r\naway\"; a terrible frown from the old gentleman rebuked my indecorous\r\nbehaviour, and I was afterwards informed that I should never be allowed\r\nthenceforth to be present on one of these solemn occasions. That was a\r\nrelief to me, but I confess I ought to have felt more contrite than I\r\ndid. At the age of nineteen and a half a boy is still a boy, but I ought\r\nto have manifested more respect for my elders.\r\n\r\nEarly in February we received news that the legation buildings in\r\nGotenyama had been destroyed by fire on the night of the 1st. Many years\r\nafterwards I learnt on the best possible authority that the incendiaries\r\nwere chiefly Chôshiû men belonging to the anti-foreign party; three at\r\nleast afterwards rose to high position in the state. These were Count\r\nItô, Minister President of State (1886); Count Inouyé Kaoru; who the\r\nthird was I forget. It need scarcely be said that they long ago\r\nabandoned their views of the necessity of putting an end to the\r\nintercourse of their country with the outside world, and they are now\r\nthe leaders of the movement in favour of the introduction into Japan of\r\nwhatever western institutions are adapted to the wants and wishes of the\r\npeople.\r\n\r\nWillis and I were now living together in a wing of the legation house at\r\nNo. 20 on the Bund, and a young Japanese _samurai_ named Kobayashi\r\nKotarô messed with us. He had been placed under Willis' charge by the\r\nJapanese Government in order to acquire the English language, and was a\r\nnice boy, though perhaps not endowed with more than average abilities.\r\nHe disappeared to his home about the time that the ultimatum of the\r\nBritish Government was presented to the Council of the Tycoon in the\r\nspring of 1863, and we never heard of him again. I had the teacher\r\nTakaoka Kanamé now all to myself, and was beginning to read Japanese\r\ndocuments. Across the hills south of the settlement lived a priest who\r\nknew something of the Sanskrit alphabet as used in Japan, and I used to\r\ngo once or twice a week to him for instruction, but these studies were\r\ninterrupted by the rumours of war that began soon to prevail; and the\r\nlessons from the American missionary, Mr. Brown, also came to an end, as\r\nI was now able to get on alone.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER VII\r\n\r\n           DEMANDS FOR REPARATION--JAPANESE PROPOSAL TO CLOSE\r\n               THE PORTS--PAYMENT OF THE INDEMNITY (1863)\r\n\r\n\r\nA VERY complete account of the murder of Richardson, and the failure of\r\nthe Japanese Government to afford satisfactory redress either for that\r\ninjury or for the attack on the Legation in June, had been sent home to\r\nthe Foreign Office, and in March 1863 Colonel Neale received\r\ninstructions to demand ample reparation from both the Tycoon and the\r\nPrince of Satsuma. On the 6th April he sent Eusden up to Yedo on board\r\nthe gunboat \"Havoc\" to deliver a Note, demanding the payment of £10,000\r\nin gold for the wives and families of Sweet and Crimp, an ample apology\r\nfor the other affair, and the payment of £100,000 as a penalty on the\r\nTycoon for allowing an Englishman to be murdered in his territory in\r\nopen daylight without making any effort to arrest the murderers. He\r\nwarned the Council that refusal would be attended with very deplorable\r\nconsequences to their country, and gave them twenty days to consider\r\ntheir reply. This lengthened period was allowed on account of the\r\nabsence of the Tycoon and his chief advisers, who had left for Kiôto on\r\nthe 3rd. If at the conclusion of the term allotted no answer was\r\nreturned, or an unsatisfactory one was given, coercive measures would\r\nimmediately be taken. It was also intended that on the return of the\r\n\"Havoc\" from Yedo, the \"Pearl\" should be despatched to Kagoshima to\r\ndemand of the Prince of Satsuma the trial and execution of the murderers\r\nof Richardson in the presence of one or more English officers, and the\r\npayment of £25,000 to be distributed to the relatives of Richardson, to\r\nMarshall, Clarke and Mrs Borradaile.\r\n\r\nOn the 10th Eusden came back from Yedo, bringing a receipt for the note\r\nand a refusal on the part of the Council to send an officer down to\r\nKagoshima to advise the Prince of Satsuma to admit the demands to be\r\nmade upon him. So the idea of despatching the \"Pearl\" was abandoned for\r\nthe moment, as it was impossible to foretell whether the Council would\r\ngive in. If they were obstinate, reprisals would at once, it was\r\nthought, be commenced, and all our available force would be required to\r\ncoerce the Tycoon's people. Satsuma must be left to be dealt with\r\nafterwards. So the Colonel waited until the 26th. By the 24th April we\r\nhad in the harbour the \"Euryalus,\" 35 guns, bearing the flag of Admiral\r\nKüper, the \"Pearl,\" 21 guns, \"Encounter,\" 14 (commanded by the brave\r\nRoderick Dew), \"Rattler,\" 17, \"Argus,\" 6, \"Centaur,\" 6, and 3 gunboats.\r\nThe despatch boats \"Racehorse\" and \"Ringdove\" were employed in\r\ntravelling backwards and forwards between Yokohama and Shanghai with the\r\nmails, and the \"Coquette\" was daily expected from Hongkong.\r\n\r\nBut as was to be anticipated, the Council begged for further delay. They\r\nasked for thirty days, and Colonel Neale gave them fifteen.\r\n\r\nMy teacher Takaoka, who had private relations with the _yashiki_ of the\r\nPrince of Ki-shiû, said they had never expected to get more than a\r\nfortnight, and as they felt certain the English Chargé d' Affaires would\r\ncut down their demands, they asked for double. He believed that the only\r\nmotive for the delay was to gain time for preparation, and that war was\r\ncertain. In the native quarter it was rumoured that the English had\r\nasked for the delay, which had been graciously granted by the Council;\r\notherwise we should have been attacked the very day after the term\r\nelapsed. The inhabitants of Yedo expected war, and began to remove their\r\nvaluables into the country. Young Kotarô had been carried off by his\r\nmama about the 20th. At Uraga, the little junk-port just outside the\r\nentrance to the bay of Yedo, there was a panic, and the people were said\r\nto have decamped with all their movable property to Hodogaya on the\r\nTôkaidô. On the other hand, there was some alarm felt in the foreign\r\nsettlement. Meetings were held at which resolutions were passed to the\r\neffect that it was the duty of the executive to provide for the safety\r\nof the European residents. At the same time the merchants declared their\r\nintention of not leaving the settlement unless specially called on to do\r\nso by Colonel Neale, as they believed that if they deserted their\r\nproperty without such an order, they would not be able to recover its\r\nvalue afterwards in the event of its being destroyed. The precedent of\r\nthe opium surrendered to Captain Elliot, the British Superintendent of\r\nTrade at Canton in 1839, was of course in their minds, and they acted\r\nprudently in throwing the responsibility on the authorities.\r\n\r\nOn the 1st May the Council asked for another delay of fifteen days.\r\nEusden was sent up to Yedo with a message to the Council that before the\r\nColonel could grant their request they must send down to Yokohama one of\r\ntheir number to receive an important communication which he had to make\r\nto them. The native population now began to be seriously alarmed, and\r\nthe shopkeepers of Kanagawa removed their effects to Hodogaya so as to\r\nbe out of reach of a bombardment, and to secure a further retreat into\r\nthe interior, if necessary, by the cross-country paths. The 2nd of May\r\nwas the last day on which the Yokohama people were permitted by the\r\nnative authorities to send away their property to Yedo. The government\r\ncirculated a sensible proclamation from door to door telling them not to\r\nbe alarmed as there would be no war. At the same time notice was served\r\non the peasants within two miles of Yokohama to be prepared to give up\r\ntheir houses to the troops, but as yet no soldiers had appeared on the\r\nscene.\r\n\r\nOn the 4th and 5th May long conferences took place between the English\r\nand French representatives and Admirals and two Commissioners for\r\nForeign Affairs, Takémoto Kai no Kami and Takémoto Hayato no Shô, who\r\nhad been deputed by the Council to explain the reasons why a further\r\ndelay was necessary. They probably represented that the difficulty in\r\nacceding to the English demands arose from the opposition of the\r\n_daimiôs_, for it seems that an offer was made to them that the English\r\nand French forces should assist the Tycoon to quell the resistance of\r\nthe anti-foreign party, in order to enable him to carry out the promises\r\nto which he was bound by treaty. They offered, it was reported, to pay\r\nthe money indemnity, disguising it under the ingenious fiction of\r\npayment for a man-of-war ordered in England, and wrecked on its way out.\r\nFinally an extension of time was accorded until the 23rd of May, in\r\norder that the personal consent of the Tycoon, who was expected to\r\nreturn by that date, might be obtained to the English ultimatum.\r\n\r\nI rode out to Hodogaya on the afternoon of the 5th and met the train of\r\nthe wife of a _daimiô_ going westwards, but saw very few armed men other\r\nthan those who accompanied her. A rumour had got about that 10,000 men\r\nwere in the village and its neighbourhood, but the report was obviously\r\nwithout foundation.\r\n\r\nDuring the night of the 5th May there was a general exodus of all the\r\nnative servants employed in the foreign settlement. Many of them took\r\nadvantage of the occasion to \"spoil the Egyptians.\" When Willis and I\r\nrose in the morning and called for \"boy\" to bring breakfast, there was a\r\ndead silence. I descended to the pantry and found it empty. Servants and\r\ncook had gone off, carrying with them a revolver, a Japanese sword,\r\nseveral spoons and forks which they doubtless imagined to be silver, and\r\nthe remains of last night's dinner wrapped in a table-cloth. This theft\r\nwas the more curious, as I had the day before entrusted my servant with\r\na considerable sum of native money to change into Mexican dollars, which\r\nhe had faithfully delivered to me. But we ought to have suspected their\r\nintentions, as they had asked for an advance of half a month's wages,\r\nand had contentedly received wages up to date. Takaoka and my groom were\r\nfaithful, so was also the messenger who went off into fits of\r\ncongratulation on learning that the petty cash-box, of which I had\r\ncharge, had not disappeared. It is much to the credit of the latter\r\nclass that they have often stuck by their masters on occasions of\r\ntrouble and even danger, when every one else has deserted the foreigner.\r\n\r\nWith some difficulty we procured some eggs and sponge cake, and I went\r\noff to the customhouse to report the robbery. The officials, of course,\r\npromised to find the thieves, but we never heard anything more of them\r\nor of our property. All day long the townspeople continued to depart at\r\na great rate. I went down to the native town, where I found many of the\r\nhouses shut up, and at others everything ready packed for removal. Among\r\nthe rest my friend the bookseller, at the corner of Benten-dôri, had\r\ntaken to his heels. But during the afternoon a proclamation was issued\r\nby the customhouse to tell the people that there would be no fighting,\r\nand many of them returned. The excitement was great throughout the town,\r\nboth among foreigners and natives, and a lamentable instance of\r\nhastiness occurred on the part of a Frenchman. A native merchant,\r\naccompanied by two others, went to ask payment of a small debt that he\r\nclaimed, and on its being refused, tried to obtain the money by force.\r\nThereupon the Frenchman shot him, and two others, including the\r\nvice-consul, also fired their revolvers. Four bullets passed through the\r\nbody of the unfortunate man, but without killing him. The French Admiral\r\nwas excessively angry. He at once arrested the merchant and had him\r\nconveyed on board the flagship. Two Americans were likewise attacked,\r\nand one of them was carried off halfway across the swamp by eight men,\r\nwho frightened him with a spear and an iron hook which they held over\r\nhis head. He was rescued by the tall sergeant of our legation guard, or\r\nelse he would probably have been severely beaten, if not killed, for the\r\nJapanese were unable to distinguish between foreigners of different\r\nnationalities.\r\n\r\nOn the 11th my teacher told me that a messenger had come to him from\r\nYedo, sent by a personage of high rank, who desired to learn\r\nconfidentially the intentions of the English Chargé d'Affaires, and\r\nwhether he was disposed to await the return of the Tycoon, which would\r\nnot be for three or four months, before taking hostile measures. In that\r\ncase the high personage, who was superior in rank to the Council, would\r\nagree to issue a proclamation that a delay of a thousand days had been\r\nagreed upon, which would have the effect of restoring tranquillity at\r\nYokohama. That if Colonel Neale, getting tired of these repeated delays,\r\nshould change the seat of the negotiations to Ozaka, the high personage\r\nwould have to perform _hara-kiri_, which he rather wished to avoid, as a\r\npenalty for failing to induce the foreigner to listen to his\r\nrepresentations. I communicated this to Colonel Neale, and the reply\r\nsent was that he could not consent to wait so long as three months.\r\n\r\nThe Council had announced the return of the Tycoon for the 24th May, and\r\nColonel Neale had replied that under the circumstances he would give\r\ntime for \"His Majesty's\" settling down again at home, but on the 16th a\r\nnote was received from them stating that circumstances had arisen which\r\nprevented their fixing any date whatever for his arrival at Yedo. This\r\nseemed to point to an indefinite postponement of a settlement, but the\r\nColonel's patience was not even yet exhausted. This accorded with what\r\nmy teacher had told me. The high personage turned out to be the Prince\r\nof Owari. Takaoka now said that having transmitted Colonel Neale's\r\nanswer to Kiôto, he would no longer be under the necessity of committing\r\nsuicide, as he had been able to show that he was not responsible for the\r\nforeigner's obstinacy.\r\n\r\nUp to the 16th the general feeling was that the Council would give way,\r\nbut the demand for a further postponement of the Japanese answer did not\r\ntend to encourage the hope of a peaceful settlement. A Japanese friend\r\ntold me that the Tycoon could not by any means accept the assistance of\r\nforeign powers against the _daimiôs_, and that the abolition of the\r\nMikado's dignity was impracticable. If we attacked Satsuma the Tycoon\r\nand _daimiôs_ would be bound to make common cause with him. I suppose\r\nthe idea of the foreign diplomatic representatives at that time was to\r\nsupport the Tycoon, whose claim to be considered the sovereign of Japan\r\nhad already been called in question by Rudolph Lindau in his \"Open\r\nLetter\" of 1862, against the anti-foreign party consisting of the Mikado\r\nand _daimiôs_, and if necessary to convert him into something more than\r\na mere feudal ruler. For we had as yet no idea of the immense potency\r\nthat lay in the mere name of the sovereign _de jure_, and our studies in\r\nJapanese history had not yet enabled us to realize the truth that in the\r\ncivil wars of Japan the victory had as a rule rested with the party that\r\nhad managed to obtain possession of the person of the Mikado and the\r\nregalia. There has probably never been any sovereign in the world whose\r\ntitle has rested upon so secure a basis as that of the ancient emperors\r\nof Japan.\r\n\r\nOn the 25th another conference took place between the English and French\r\ndiplomatic and naval authorities on the one side, and Takémoto Kai no\r\nKami and a new man named Shibata Sadatarô on the other. The latter began\r\nby thanking the foreign representatives in the name of the Tycoon for\r\ntheir offer of material assistance, which he was, however, compelled to\r\ndecline, as he must endeavour to settle the differences between the\r\n_daimiôs_ and himself by his own unaided forces and authority. As to\r\nthe indemnity, the Tycoon's government recognized that the demand was\r\njust, but they were afraid to pay immediately, as their yielding would\r\nbring the _daimiôs_ down upon them. But they offered to pay the money by\r\ninstalments in such a manner as not to attract public notice, and the\r\nfurther discussion of the details was put off to a future occasion.\r\nProbably Colonel Neale did not care very much how the matter was\r\narranged, provided he could show to Her Majesty's Government that he had\r\ncarried out his instructions. So the basis of an understanding was\r\narrived at, and it was further conceded that the foreign\r\nrepresentatives, that is those of England and France, should take\r\nmeasures to defend Yokohama from attack by the anti-foreign party.\r\n\r\nColonel Neale had written to Major-General Brown, who was in command at\r\nShanghai, applying for a force of two thousand men, but a despatch now\r\narrived from the general stating his inability and objections to\r\nfurnishing any troops. It was said that he had ridiculed the idea of a\r\nmilitary expedition against Japan long before Colonel Neale proposed it\r\nto him. Nevertheless the establishment of a garrison of English troops\r\nat Yokohama was merely delayed by this refusal, and after Sir Rutherford\r\nAlcock's return to Japan in the spring of 1864 good reasons were given\r\nto the same general why he should change his mind.\r\n\r\nAll this time there existed considerable alarm with respect to the aims\r\nand intentions of a somewhat mysterious class of Japanese called\r\n_rônin_. These were men of the two-sworded class, who had thrown up the\r\nservice of their _daimiôs_, and plunged into the political agitations of\r\nthe time, which had a two-fold object, firstly, to restore the Mikado to\r\nhis ancient position, or rather to pull down the Tycoon to the same\r\nlevel as the great _daimiôs_, and secondly, the expulsion of \"the\r\nbarbarians\" from the sacred soil of Japan. They came principally from\r\nthe south and west of the country, but there were many from Mito in the\r\neast, and a sprinkling from all the other clans. About the end of May\r\nthere was a rumour that they designed to attack Kanagawa, and the\r\nAmericans still living there were compelled to transfer their residence\r\nto Yokohama, not, however, without \"compensation for disturbance.\"\r\n\r\nThe Tycoon's people were naturally desirous of doing all that was\r\npracticable to conciliate their domestic enemies, and turned such\r\nrumours to account in the hope of being able to confine the foreigners\r\nat Yokohama within a limited space, such as had formed the\r\nprison-residence of the Dutch at Nagasaki in former times. Incidents,\r\ntoo, were not wanting of a character to enforce their arguments. One of\r\nthe assistants of the English consulate was threatened with personal\r\nviolence by a couple of two-sworded men as he was entering a tea-house\r\non the hill at Kanagawa. He pulled out his pistol, and pointed it at\r\nthem, on which they drew back. Taking advantage of the opportunity he\r\nran down to the landing-place, where he got a boat and so returned in\r\nsafety to Yokohama. It was reported that the officials at the guardhouse\r\ntried to prevent the boatmen from taking him across the bay, but however\r\nthis may be, they pacified his assailants, one of whom had half-drawn\r\nhis sword; and in those days we were always told that a _samurai_ might\r\nnot return his sword to the scabbard without shedding blood, so that the\r\naffair was entitled to be ranked as very alarming.\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of June, in consequence of a report that half-a-dozen\r\n_rônins_ were concealed in the place, the _betté-gumi_ (a body from\r\nwhich the legation guards at Yedo were supplied), together with some\r\ndrilled troops, came down to Yokohama, and took up their quarters at\r\nsome newly erected buildings under Nogé hill, and from that date until\r\nlong after the revolution of 1868 we had constantly a native garrison. I\r\nrecognized among the former several men with whom I had become friends\r\nduring the visit to Yedo already narrated. Fresh additions were made to\r\nthe British squadron in the shape of two sloops, the \"Leopard\" and the\r\n\"Perseus.\" The rumours of warlike operations had died away, and it was\r\ngiven out that the intention of directly enforcing our demands on\r\nSatsuma had been abandoned, as the Tycoon had undertaken to see to that\r\npart of the business, and it was believed also that to insist upon them\r\nat present would give rise to a civil war.\r\n\r\nOn the 14th June there arrived at the legation in Yokohama Kikuchi Iyo\r\nno Kami and Shibata Sadatarô, Commissioners for Foreign Affairs, to\r\ncomplete arrangements for paying $440,000 (representing £110,000) in\r\nseven instalments extending over six weeks, the first to be delivered on\r\nthe 18th. But on that day came a note of excuse from one of the Council\r\nstating that unavoidable circumstances had arisen which prevented the\r\nagreement being carried out, and that he himself would in a day or two\r\narrive at Yokohama to discuss matters with the English Chargé d'\r\nAffaires. Colonel Neale very properly refused to hold any more\r\ncommunications with the Tycoon's ministers, and after a couple of days'\r\nconsideration, finally placed the solution in the hands of Admiral\r\nKüper. The latter, it was said, did not know what to do. He had never\r\nseen a gun fired in action, and hardly appreciated the Colonel's\r\nsuggestion that he should at once proceed to seize the steamers lately\r\npurchased in such numbers by the Japanese. The Council at Yedo now\r\nbecame thoroughly frightened; they had temporized as long as possible,\r\nand had worn out the patience of the English authorities. But they left\r\nno stone unturned to avoid openly giving way, and Ogasawara himself came\r\ndown to Yokohama to bring the French Chargé d'Affaires and Admiral to\r\nintercede. The latter, however, refused; insisted on the demands of\r\nGreat Britain being satisfied, and claimed that the defence of Yokohama\r\nshould be entrusted to them. Ogasawara had just returned from Kiôto with\r\nan order from the Tycoon, dictated to him by the Mikado and the\r\nanti-foreign element in the ancient capital, to make arrangements with\r\nthe foreign representatives for closing all the ports! For himself he\r\nseemed to dislike his instructions, and even gave hints to the French\r\nChargé d'Affaires as to the nature of the reply which had best be given.\r\nA pageful of notes of exclamation would not be sufficient to express the\r\nastonishment of the foreign public of Yokohama when this extraordinary\r\nannouncement was made, but the presence of the combined squadrons in the\r\nharbour relieved them from any anxiety as to the manner in which the\r\ndiplomatic representatives would reply to it.\r\n\r\nThe Japanese Government, having completely failed to persuade the French\r\nauthorities to intervene on their behalf, which would have indeed been\r\nimpossible when the request was accompanied by the preposterous demand\r\nthat foreigners should forthwith clear out of Yokohama, sent a message\r\nto Colonel Neale at one a.m. on the morning of the 24th June to say that\r\nthe money should be paid, and requesting to be informed at what hour he\r\nwould receive it. The reply was that the original agreement to pay in\r\ninstalments, having been broken by the Japanese Government, was now null\r\nand void, and that the whole must be delivered in the course of the day.\r\nThis was accordingly done; at an early hour carts laden with boxes\r\ncontaining each a couple of thousand dollars began to arrive at the\r\nlegation. All the Chinese shroffs (men employed by merchants and bankers\r\nin the Far East to examine coin to see whether it is genuine) were\r\nborrowed to do the shroffing and counting. The chancery was crowded with\r\nthe intelligent Chinamen busily employed in clinking one coin against\r\nanother, and putting them up into parcels, to be replaced in the boxes\r\nand carried off on board the squadron. The process occupied three days.\r\nBut already on the 24th Colonel Neale had addressed a letter to the\r\nAdmiral relieving him of the unwelcome task of undertaking coercive\r\noperations.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: PAYMENT OF THE INDEMNITY FOR THE MURDER OF RICHARDSON]\r\n\r\nThe note, dated on the very day on which the indemnity was paid, in\r\nwhich Ogasawara Dzusho no Kami (to give him his full title) had conveyed\r\nto Colonel Neale the orders of the Tycoon to close the ports and expel\r\nall foreigners from the country, was the first on which I was called to\r\nexercise my capacity as a translator. Of course I had to get the help of\r\nmy teacher to read it, but my previous practice in the epistolary style\r\nenabled me to understand the construction, and to give a closer version\r\nperhaps than either of the others which were prepared in the legation.\r\nThis, to me supremely important, document ran as follows:--\r\n\r\n    I communicate with you by a despatch.\r\n\r\n    The orders of the Tycoon, received from Kiôto, are to the effect\r\n    that the ports are to be closed and the foreigners driven out,\r\n    because the people of the country do not desire intercourse with\r\n    foreign countries. The discussion of this has been entirely\r\n    entrusted to me by His Majesty. I therefore send you this\r\n    communication first, before holding a Conference as to the\r\n    details.\r\n\r\n    Respectful and humble communication.\r\n\r\nIt is perhaps a little too literal. The opening phrase is simply\r\nequivalent to the \"Monsieur le Chargé d'Affaires,\" and the sentence with\r\nwhich the note concludes is about the same thing as the \"assurance of\r\nhigh consideration,\" which we have borrowed from the French. But the\r\nrest of it is accurate, and the allusion to the Mikado which appears in\r\nthe version made from the Dutch translation furnished by the Japanese\r\n(_vide_ the Bluebook) had nothing to support it in the original text. I\r\ncannot forbear from quoting the reply of Colonel Neale, though as far as\r\npossible I intend in these \"Reminiscences\" not to rely on published\r\nsources of information. It ran thus:--\r\n\r\n    Lieutenant-Colonel Neale to the Japanese Minister for Foreign\r\n    Affairs.\r\n\r\n                                            Yokohama, June 24, 1863.\r\n\r\n    The undersigned, Her Britannic Majesty's Chargé d'Affaires, has\r\n    received, in common with his colleagues, and with extreme\r\n    amazement, the extraordinary announcement which, under\r\n    instructions from the Tycoon, His Excellency has addressed to\r\n    him.\r\n\r\n    Apart from the audacious nature of this announcement, which is\r\n    unaccompanied by any explanations whatever, the Undersigned is\r\n    bound to believe that both the Spiritual and Temporal sovereigns\r\n    of this country are totally ignorant of the disastrous\r\n    consequences which must arise to Japan by their determinations\r\n    thus conveyed through you to close the opened ports, and to\r\n    remove therefrom the subjects of the Treaty Powers.\r\n\r\n    For himself, as Representative of Her Britannic Majesty, the\r\n    Undersigned has to observe, in the first instance, that the\r\n    Rulers of this country may perhaps still have it in their power\r\n    to modify and soften the severe and irresistible measures which\r\n    will, without the least doubt, be adopted by Great Britain most\r\n    effectually to maintain and enforce its Treaty obligations with\r\n    this country, and, more than this, to place them on a far more\r\n    satisfactory and solid footing than heretofore, by speedily\r\n    making known and developing any rational and acceptable plans\r\n    directed to this end, which may be at present concealed by His\r\n    Majesty the Tycoon or the Mikado, or by both, to the great and\r\n    imminent peril of Japan.\r\n\r\n    It is therefore the duty of the Undersigned solemnly to warn the\r\n    Rulers of this country that when the decision of Her Majesty's\r\n    Government, consequent upon the receipt of Your Excellency's\r\n    announcement, shall have in due course been taken, the\r\n    development of all ulterior determinations now kept back will be\r\n    of no avail.\r\n\r\n    The Undersigned has in the meantime to inform Your Excellency,\r\n    with a view that you may bring the same to the knowledge of His\r\n    Majesty the Tycoon, who will doubtless make the same known to\r\n    the Mikado, that the indiscreet communication now made through\r\n    Your Excellency is unparalleled in the history of all nations,\r\n    civilized or uncivilized; that it is, in fact, a declaration of\r\n    war by Japan itself against the whole of the Treaty Powers, and\r\n    the consequences of which, if not at once arrested, it will have\r\n    to expiate by the severest and most merited chastisement.\r\n\r\n    With Respect and Consideration.\r\n\r\n                                               EDWD. ST. JOHN NEALE.\r\n\r\nWith the exception of the lapse from the third person to the second, in\r\nthe second, third and fourth paragraphs, this note is well constructed,\r\nand its periods nicely balanced. The language is perhaps rather stronger\r\nthan more modern taste would approve, but with a powerful, almost\r\noverwhelming squadron of men-of-war at one's back, the temptation to\r\nexpress one's feelings with frankness is not easy to resist.\r\n\r\nWhat the writer meant by \"rational and acceptable means\" directed to the\r\nend of placing the treaty obligations of Great Britain with Japan on a\r\nmore \"satisfactory and solid footing than heretofore\" can only be\r\nconjectured. I think it is an allusion to the plan that had been mooted\r\nof our affording material assistance to the Tycoon in suppressing the\r\nopposition of the _daimiôs_ of the west and south to the pro-foreign\r\npolicy of the Japanese Government, and perhaps to a formal agreement\r\nbetween the Tycoon and the Mikado that the latter should ratify the\r\ntreaties. Certainly the successful execution of such a plan would have\r\nplaced the Tycoon firmly in the seat of his ancestors, and have\r\nforestalled the revolution of 1868 by which his successor was upset, but\r\nit would not have been effected without enormous bloodshed, and the\r\nJapanese people would have hated the ruler who had called in foreign aid\r\nto strengthen his position. He could then only have maintained himself\r\nthere by the adoption of the severest measures of repression, and the\r\nnation would have been subjected to a terrible and lasting despotism. It\r\nis certainly a thing to rejoice at that the Tycoon's council had\r\nsufficient patriotism to reject such an offer. The Japanese were left to\r\nwork out their own salvation, and when the revolution did at last break\r\nout, the loss of life and property was restricted within narrow limits,\r\nwhile the resulting benefits to the Japanese nation in the establishment\r\nof civilized and comparatively free institutions have been such as would\r\nhave been for ever precluded had the suggestions of certain Europeans\r\nbeen listened to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\n                        BOMBARDMENT OF KAGOSHIMA\r\n\r\n\r\nTHUS one portion of the instructions sent out from home had been carried\r\ninto effect, and there now remained only the exaction of reparation from\r\nthe Prince of Satsuma. The demands to be made included, it will be\r\nremembered, the trial and execution in the presence of English officers\r\nof the murderers of Richardson, and the payment by the Prince of an\r\nindemnity of £25,000 as compensation to Richardson's relatives and to\r\nthe three other members of the party who had been attacked. Marshall and\r\nClarke had recovered from their wounds, which in the case of the latter\r\nwere serious enough, as he had received a dangerous sword cut in the\r\nshoulder, and Mrs Borradaile, who was not wounded, had returned to\r\nChina. The Tycoon's people were naturally desirous of having the\r\nsettlement with Satsuma left in their hands, but I suppose Ogasawara,\r\nwhen pressed on the point by Colonel Neale, acknowledged that the\r\ngovernment were impotent in the matter, and the British Chargé\r\nd'Affaires consequently assumed the responsibility of requesting the\r\nAdmiral to convey him and his staff to Kagoshima, in order to present\r\nthe demands he had been instructed to formulate.\r\n\r\nThe Admiral had at first been unwilling to send more than a couple of\r\nships, but it was finally determined that the squadron should consist of\r\nH.M.S. \"Euryalus,\" \"Pearl,\" \"Perseus,\" \"Argus,\" \"Coquette,\" \"Racehorse,\"\r\nand the gunboat \"Havoc.\" The whole staff of the legation, from Colonel\r\nNeale down to myself, embarked on board the various ships, Willis and\r\nmyself being in the paddle-sloop \"Argus,\" Commander Lewis Moore. The\r\nweather on the voyage down was remarkably fine, and the squadron arrived\r\nat the mouth of the Bay of Kagoshima, where it anchored for the night,\r\non the afternoon of the 11th August. Early on the following morning we\r\nproceeded up the bay, and came to an anchor off the town.\r\n\r\nA letter had been prepared beforehand stating the demands, which had\r\nsomehow or other been translated into Japanese by Siebold and his\r\nteacher; it was a difficult document, and I fancy the Japanese version\r\ndid not read very well. A boat at once came off from the shore with two\r\nofficers, to whom the letter was delivered. In the afternoon of the\r\nfollowing day some other officials visited the flagship, and stated that\r\nit was quite impossible to say when the answer would be given. The name\r\nof the principal official who visited Colonel Neale on this occasion was\r\nIjichi Shôji. I knew him very well afterwards in Yedo. He and his\r\nretinue of forty men came on board, after having exchanged a parting cup\r\nof _saké_ with their prince, with the full design of making a sudden\r\nonslaught upon the British officers, and killing at any rate the\r\nprincipal ones among them; they intended in this way to make themselves\r\nmasters of the flagship. It was a bold conception, and might have been\r\nsuccessful but for the precautions taken on our side. Only two or three\r\nwere admitted into the Admiral's cabin, while the marines kept a\r\nvigilant eye upon the retinue who remained on the quarter deck. While\r\nthey were still on board another boat arrived, whether with\r\nreinforcements or orders to countermand the intended slaughter I do not\r\nknow, but Ijichi, after communicating with the men who came in her, said\r\nhe must return to the shore. In the evening a written reply was\r\nreceived, the bearer of which was told to return on the following\r\nmorning to learn whether it was considered of a satisfactory character.\r\n\r\nThe letter on examination proved to contain a _fin de non recevoir_; it\r\nsaid that the murderers could not be found, blamed the Tycoon for having\r\nmade treaties without inserting a clause to prevent foreigners from\r\nimpeding the passage of the prince along the highroads; spoke of delay\r\nuntil the criminals could be arrested, captured, and punished, after\r\nwhich the question of an indemnity could be discussed, and practically\r\nreferred the British Chargé d'Affaires back to the Yedo Government. When\r\nthe messenger arrived on the morning of the 14th, he was informed that\r\nthe reply was considered unsatisfactory, and that no further\r\ncommunication would be held with the Japanese except under a flag of\r\ntruce. The Admiral then made a little trip up the bay to reconnoitre\r\nsome foreign-built steamers lying at anchor off Wilmot Point in the\r\nplan, and take some soundings at the head of the bay beyond. On his\r\nreturn in the afternoon the commanders of the various ships were\r\nsummoned on board the flagship to receive their instructions from the\r\nAdmiral. There was no intention on our part of immediately attacking the\r\nbatteries, but the Admiral probably supposed that by adopting reprisals,\r\nthat is taking possession of the steamers, he would induce the Satsuma\r\nmen to give some more satisfactory reply than that already received.\r\n\r\nIn pursuance of this plan, Captain Borlase in the \"Pearl,\" with the\r\n\"Coquette,\" \"Argus,\" and \"Racehorse,\" proceeded to seize the steamers at\r\ndawn of the 15th. We were, of course, very excited, and busily engaged,\r\nas we approached, in estimating the probability of their offering\r\nresistance; but as the \"Argus\" was laid alongside the \"Sir George Grey,\"\r\nwe saw the crew rapidly disappearing over the other side into shore\r\nboats with which they had already provided themselves. No attempt was\r\nmade by us to take any prisoners, but two remained on board the \"Sir\r\nGeorge Grey,\" who gave their names to me as Godai and Matsugi Kôwan. On\r\nbeing transferred to the flagship they adopted the aliases of Otani and\r\nKashiwa. The former was a remarkably handsome man, with a noble\r\ncountenance, and was, I believe, the captain of the steamer. The\r\nprofession of the second was that of a physician; he had been to Europe\r\nwith the first Japanese embassy in 1862, and had in fact only just\r\nreturned. Both of them were afterwards well known, the first as a rather\r\nspeculative man of business who established indigo works at Ozaka with\r\ncapital borrowed from the Mikado's government, the second was for a\r\nshort time prefect of Yokohama in 1868, and afterwards Minister for\r\nForeign Affairs under the name of Terashima Munénori, and he still (in\r\n1887) holds office at Tôkiô.\r\n\r\nWe returned, with our prizes lashed alongside, to the anchorage under\r\nthe island of Sakura Jima, whither the squadron had removed on the\r\nafternoon of the 12th in order to be out of range of the guns in the\r\nforts before the town, the \"Euryalus\" and \"Pearl\" lying about mid\r\nchannel, between us and the forts. Here we awaited the development of\r\nevents, which came sooner than was expected. The Japanese made no sign,\r\nand we could not divine their intentions from the slight glimpses\r\nobtainable of the movements on shore. But at noon the report of a gun\r\nwas suddenly heard, and immediately all the batteries opened fire upon\r\nthe squadron. Although it was raining and blowing like a typhoon, the\r\nAdmiral at once gave orders to engage, and made a signal to us and the\r\n\"Racehorse\" and the \"Coquette\" to burn the prizes. On this we all rushed\r\non board our prize and began to plunder. I secured a Japanese matchlock\r\nand a conical black war-hat (_jin-gasa_), but some of the officers found\r\nmoney, silver _ichibus_ and gilt _nibus_. The sailors seized hold of\r\neverything portable, such as looking glasses, decanters, benches and\r\neven old pieces of matting. After about an hour of this disorder the\r\nsteamer was scuttled and set on fire, and we went to take up our order\r\nin the line of battle. The plan shows how the line was formed.\r\n\r\nSome time elapsed before we returned the fire of the Japanese, and it\r\nwas said that the tardiness of the flagship in replying to the first\r\nshot of the Japanese (two hours) was due to the fact that the door of\r\nthe ammunition magazine was obstructed by piles of boxes of dollars, the\r\nmoney paid for the indemnity being still on board. The \"Perseus,\" which\r\nwas lying close under fort No. 9, had to slip her cable, and the anchor\r\nwas months afterwards recovered by the Satsuma people and returned to\r\nus. Owing to this delay she had to take the last position in the line.\r\nIt was a novel sensation to be exposed to cannon shot, and the\r\nboisterous weather did not add at all to one's equanimity. The whole\r\nline went a little way up the bay, and then curving round to the left\r\nreturned along the northern shore at a distance of about 400 yards, each\r\nvessel as she passed pouring her broadside into the successive forts.\r\nAbout three quarters of an hour after the engagement commenced we saw\r\nthe flagship hauling off, and next the \"Pearl\" (which had rather lagged\r\nbehind) swerved out of the line. The cause of this was the death of\r\nCaptain Josling and Commander Wilmot of the \"Euryalus\" from a roundshot\r\nfired from fort No. 7. Unwittingly she had been steered between the fort\r\nand a target at which the Japanese gunners were in the habit of\r\npractising, and they had her range to a nicety. A 10-inch shell exploded\r\non her main-deck about the same time, killing seven men and wounding an\r\nofficer, and altogether the gallant ship had got into a hot corner;\r\nunder the fire of 37 guns at once, from 10-inch down to 18 pounders. The\r\n\"Racehorse\" having got ashore opposite fort No. 8, the \"Coquette\" and\r\n\"Argus\" went back to tow her off, which we succeeded in doing after\r\nabout an hour's work. During this time she kept up a constant cannonade,\r\nand the gunners in the fort were unable to do her any mischief. But at\r\none moment it was feared that she would have to be abandoned and set on\r\nfire. I shall never forget the interest and excitement of the whole\r\naffair, from the bursting of the shells high in the air against the grey\r\nsky all round the flagship as she lay at anchor before we weighed, till\r\nwe came into action ourselves and could see first the belching forth of\r\nflame from the middle of a puff of smoke, and then, strange to say, a\r\nround black thing coming straight at us. This black thing, however,\r\nsuddenly rose high into the air just as it seemed about to strike us,\r\nand passed overhead. The \"Argus\" was struck only three times, first in\r\nthe starboard gangway, then by a shot which went right through the\r\nmainmast, but left it standing, and thirdly by a round shot near the\r\nwater line which penetrated about three inches, and then fell off into\r\nthe sea. By five o'clock we were all safely anchored again under Josling\r\npoint, except the \"Havoc,\" which went off to set fire to five Loochooan\r\njunks that were lying off the factories. Probably the latter were set on\r\nfire by sparks from the junks, but credit was taken for their wilful\r\ndestruction. Under the impression that a large white building in the\r\nrear of the town was the prince's palace, every effort was made to\r\ndestroy it, but it turned out afterwards to be a temple, and we learnt\r\nthat during the engagement the prince and his father had not been within\r\nrange. Rockets were also fired with the object of burning the town, in\r\nwhich we were only too successful. The gale had increased to such a\r\nheight that all efforts on the part of the townspeople to extinguish the\r\nflames must have been unavailing. It was an awful and magnificent sight,\r\nthe sky all filled with a cloud of smoke lit up from below by the\r\npointed masses of pale fire.\r\n\r\nOur prize was still burning when we came back to our former anchorage,\r\nand as she had 140 tons of coal on board she made a good bonfire. At\r\nlast she gave a lurch and went to the bottom. It was no doubt a great\r\ndisappointment to the sailors, for the steamers alone were worth\r\n$300,000, and everyone would have had a good share of prize money if we\r\nhad been able to carry them off. It was rumoured that the prizes were\r\nburnt at Colonel Neale's instance, who was very anxious, like the old\r\nwarrior that he was, that every ship should go into action unhampered.\r\nIt was also said that poor Captain Josling urged the Admiral against his\r\nbetter judgment to fight that day, in spite of the adverse weather.\r\n\r\nOn Sunday morning the 16th August the bodies of Captain Josling,\r\nCommander Wilmot and of the nine men who had lost their lives in the\r\naction were buried in the sea. In the afternoon the squadron weighed\r\nanchor and proceeded down the bay at slow speed, shelling the batteries\r\nand town at long range until we left them too far behind. We anchored\r\nfor the night at some distance from the town, and on the 17th proceeded\r\nto return to Yokohama. Most of us on board the \"Argus,\" and I believe\r\nthe feeling was the same on board the other ships, came away bitterly\r\ndiscontented.\r\n\r\nThe Japanese guns still continued firing at us as we left, though all\r\ntheir shot fell short, and they might fairly claim that though we had\r\ndismounted some of their batteries and laid the town in ruins, they had\r\nforced us to retreat. Had we maintained the bombardment until every gun\r\nwas silenced, and then landed, or even lain off the town for a few days,\r\nthe opinion was that the demands would have been acceded to. Rumour said\r\nthat Colonel Neale was very anxious that the Admiral should land some\r\nmen and carry off a few guns as trophies of victory, but that he\r\ndeclined to send a single man on shore. And men said that he was\r\ndemoralized by the death of his flag-captain and commander, with whom he\r\nwas talking on the bridge when the shot came that took off their heads.\r\nBut none of this appears in the official correspondence. I believe the\r\nreal explanation to be that differences had arisen between the\r\ndiplomatist and the sailor, the former of whom interfered too much with\r\nthe conduct of the operations. No doubt the etiquette was for him to\r\nremain silent after he had placed matters in the hands of the Admiral,\r\nbut this the impetuosity of his nature would not permit him to do. It is\r\nalso possible that insufficiency of the supply of coals, provisions and\r\nammunition may have been a factor in the determination that was come to.\r\nThe Admiral in his report, which was published in the London \"Gazette,\"\r\ntook credit for the destruction of the town, and Mr. Bright very\r\nproperly called attention to this unnecessary act of severity in the\r\nHouse of Commons; whereupon he wrote again, or Colonel Neale wrote, to\r\nexplain that the conflagration was accidental. But that I cannot think\r\nwas a correct representation of what took place, in face of the fact\r\nthat the \"Perseus\" continued to fire rockets into the town after the\r\nengagement with the batteries was at an end, and it is also inconsistent\r\nwith the air of satisfaction which marks the despatch reporting that\r\n£1,000,000 worth of property had been destroyed during the bombardment.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: KAGOSIMA HARBOUR]\r\n\r\nAfter the return of the squadron to Yokohama we settled down quietly\r\nagain, and the trade went on pretty much as usual; there were some\r\ncomplaints that the Tycoon's council were laying hands on all the raw\r\nsilk destined for exportation, with a view doubtless of forcing up the\r\nprice and so recouping themselves out of foreign pockets for the\r\nindemnities they had been forced to pay to the British Government. But\r\non a strong protest being made to them by Colonel Neale, the embargo was\r\nremoved. Rumours reached us of disturbances at Kiôto, where the\r\nretainers of Chôshiû had been plotting to take possession of the palace,\r\nand seize the person of the Mikado. Failing in their plans, they had\r\nbeen dismissed from their share in guarding the palace, and had departed\r\nto their native province, taking with them seven court nobles who had\r\nbeen mixed up in the plot. Amongst them were Sanjô Sanéyoshi,\r\nHigashi-Kuzé and Sawa, who afterwards held high office in the government\r\nof the restoration.\r\n\r\nThe ill-success of the Chôshiû clan, which had been one of the foremost\r\nin demanding the expulsion of the foreigners, was a turn of luck for the\r\nTycoon, and the result was the withdrawal of the circular of Ogasawara\r\nproposing the closing of the ports. Ogasawara himself was disgraced.\r\nForeigners at Yokohama began to breathe freely again, and to renew their\r\nformer excursions in the neighbouring country.\r\n\r\nBut on the 14th October a fresh outrage completely upset our\r\ntranquillity. A French officer of Chasseurs named Camus, while taking\r\nhis afternoon's ride at a distance of not more than two or three miles\r\nfrom the settlement, and far from the high road, was attacked and\r\nmurdered. His right arm was found at a little distance from his body,\r\nstill clutching the bridle of his pony. There was a cut down one side of\r\nthe face, one through the nose, a third across the chin, the right\r\njugular vein was severed by a slash in the throat, and the vertebral\r\ncolumn was completely divided. The left arm was hanging on by a piece of\r\nskin and the left side laid open to the heart. All the wounds were\r\nperfectly clean, thus showing what a terrible weapon the Japanese\r\n_katana_ was in the hands of a skilful swordsman. No clue to the\r\nidentity of the perpetrators of this horrible assassination was ever\r\ndiscovered, but it made a profound impression upon the foreign\r\ncommunity, who after that were careful not to ride out unarmed or in\r\nparties of less than three or four. Not that we were able to place much\r\nconfidence in our revolvers, for it was pretty certain that the\r\n_samurai_ who was lying in wait to kill a foreigner would not carry out\r\nhis purpose unless he could take his victim at a disadvantage, and cases\r\nof chance encounters with peaceably inclined Japanese were not known to\r\nhave occurred. Excepting perhaps the Richardson affair, from the very\r\nfirst all these murders were premeditated, and the perpetrators took\r\ncare to secure their own safety beforehand.\r\n\r\nIt was an agreeable surprise to us a month later, when there appeared at\r\nthe legation two high officers of Satsuma, who undertook to pay the\r\nindemnity of £25,000 and gave an engagement to make diligent search for\r\nRichardson's murderers, who upon their arrest were to be punished with\r\ndeath in the presence of British officers, in accordance with the\r\noriginal demand. We may give Colonel Neale credit for knowing that there\r\nwas no genuine intention on the part of Satsuma to carry out this\r\npromise, but on the other hand there was strong reason to suppose that\r\nShimadzu Saburô himself had actually given the order to cut down the\r\nforeigners, and it could hardly be expected that the Satsuma men would\r\never consent to do punishment upon him. The actual doers of the deed\r\nwere merely subordinate agents. We could not with justice have insisted\r\non their lives being taken, and at the same time suffer the principal\r\nculprit to go scot-free. In order to succeed therefore in enforcing the\r\nwhole of the demands made by Her Majesty's Government, it would have\r\nbeen necessary to invade Satsuma with an overwhelming force and\r\nexterminate the greater part of the clan before we could get at their\r\nchief; and we may be sure that he would never have fallen alive into our\r\nhands. We had bombarded and destroyed the greater part of the forts and\r\ntown, probably killed a good many persons who were innocent of\r\nRichardson's murder, and had thereby elevated what was in the beginning\r\na crime against public order into a _casus belli_. There would indeed,\r\nit seems to me, have been no justification after that for taking more\r\nlives by way of expiation. The Satsuma envoys, however, formally\r\nacknowledged that their countrymen had been in the wrong, and they paid\r\nthe fine demanded by the British Government. No one therefore can blame\r\nthe British Chargé d'Affaires for having made peace on these terms. It\r\nshould be mentioned, however, that the Satsuma men borrowed the money\r\nfrom the Tycoon's treasury, and I have never heard that it was repaid.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER IX\r\n\r\n                   SHIMONOSEKI; PRELIMINARY MEASURES\r\n\r\n\r\nSIR RUTHERFORD ALCOCK returned from Europe early in March 1864, and\r\nColonel Neale took his departure. The members of the legation gave him a\r\nfarewell dinner, at which he delivered himself of prognostications as to\r\nthe future of those who had served under him. For me he prophesied a\r\nprofessorship of Japanese at an English University, but so far his words\r\nhave not come true. The new chief was liked by everyone, and he was\r\nparticularly gracious to myself, relieving me from all chancery work, so\r\nthat I could devote the whole of my time to my Japanese studies. Willis\r\nand I occupied a wooden house in a back street between the native town\r\nand the foreign settlement, and there I worked industriously with my\r\nthree teachers. Sir Rutherford had brought with him very ample powers,\r\nwhich he determined to make use of to chastise the Chôshiû clan for its\r\nhostile attitude. We had, it might be said, conquered the goodwill of\r\nSatsuma, and a similar process applied to the other principal head of\r\nthe anti-foreign party might well be expected to produce an equally\r\nwholesome effect. In the summer of the previous year the Chôshiû people,\r\nacting upon the orders which they had extorted from the Mikado for the\r\n\"expulsion of the barbarians,\" had fired upon an American merchant\r\nvessel, a Dutch corvette and a French despatch-boat as they passed\r\nthrough the straits of Shimonoséki. The corvette had returned the fire,\r\nand in the other two cases satisfaction of an incomplete kind had been\r\nobtained by the United States sloop \"Wyoming\" and the French squadron\r\nunder Admiral Jaurès respectively. The batteries had been destroyed, but\r\nas soon as the foreign men-of-war quitted the scene, the Chôshiû men set\r\nto work to rebuild the forts, to construct others, and to mount all the\r\nguns they could bring together. So the hornet's nest was after no long\r\ninterval in good repair again, and more formidable for attack and\r\ndefence than before. That no foreign vessels could take their way\r\nthrough the straits of Shimonoséki, which they had been in the habit of\r\npassing from time to time after touching at Nagasaki in order to make a\r\npleasant and easy passage to Yokohama, instead of encountering the\r\nstormy Cape Chichakoff, was felt to involve a diminution of western\r\nprestige. Nothing but the complete subjugation of this warlike clan, and\r\nthe permanent destruction of its means of offence, would suffice to\r\nconvince the Japanese nation that we were determined to enforce the\r\ntreaties, and to carry on our trade without molestation from anybody,\r\nirrespective of internal dissensions.\r\n\r\nSir Rutherford Alcock therefore lost no time in diligently setting to\r\nwork in order to bring about a coalition with the representatives of\r\nFrance, Holland and the United States. In this he completely succeeded.\r\nThe Tycoon's government were warned that if they did not within twenty\r\ndays give a satisfactory undertaking to re-open the straits, the foreign\r\nsquadrons would be despatched thither to bring the Prince of Chôshiû to\r\nreason. By a curious coincidence there had just returned to Japan two\r\nout of a band of five young _samurai_ of Chôshiû, who the year before\r\nhad been smuggled away to England to see the world, and learn something\r\nof the resources of foreign powers. Their names were Itô Shunsuké and\r\nInouyé Bunda. The other three who remained in England while their\r\ncompanions, armed with the new knowledge, set forth on their journey to\r\nwarn their fellow clansmen that it was no use trying to run their heads\r\nagainst a brick wall, were Endo Kinsuké, Inouyé Masaru and Yamao Yôzo.\r\nThey made themselves and the object of their return known to Sir\r\nRutherford, who promptly seized the opportunity thus offered of entering\r\ninto direct communication with the _daimiô_ of Chôshiû, and while\r\ndelivering a sort of ultimatum, of affording him the chance of\r\nabandoning his hostile attitude for one more in accordance with the\r\ntreaties. He obtained the consent of his colleagues to the despatch of\r\ntwo men-of-war to the neighbourhood of Shimonoséki in order to land the\r\ntwo young men at a convenient spot, and delivered to them a long\r\nmemorandum for presentation to their prince.\r\n\r\nA French officer (Commandant Layrle) and a Dutch naval officer, besides\r\nMajor Wray, R.E., were sent at the same time to gain what information\r\nmight be obtainable as to the present condition of the batteries, and to\r\nmy great joy I was lent as interpreter, along with my colleague, Mr. J.\r\nJ. Enslie. On the 21st July we left in the corvette \"Barrosa,\" Captain\r\nW. M. Dowell, and the gun vessel \"Cormorant,\" Commander Buckle, and\r\npassing up the Bungo channel, anchored off Himéshima Island after dark\r\non the 26th. We ran ashore, but managed to get off again, smashing the\r\njib-boom of the \"Cormorant\" as we did so. Early on the following morning\r\nwe landed our two Japanese friends Itô and Inouyé (who at that time went\r\nby the name of Shiji), after promising to call for them on the 7th\r\nAugust at the island of Kasato, off the coast of Suwô. On the way down I\r\nhad talked a good deal with them, and between us, with the aid of my\r\nteacher, Nakazawa Kensaku (a retainer of Ogasawara, who had to seek his\r\nlivelihood in consequence of his master's disgrace), we had managed to\r\nput Sir Rutherford's memorandum into Japanese. They were to cross over\r\nin an open boat and land at Tonomi in Suwô. At eight o'clock we saw them\r\nleave the shore. In Nakazawa's opinion the chances were six or seven out\r\nof ten that their heads would be cut off, and that we should never see\r\nthem again.\r\n\r\nWe landed later on in the day at Himéshima and found the people very\r\nfriendly. They sold to us a plentiful supply of fish, but there were no\r\nvegetables, beef or chickens to be had. Cattle were pretty plentiful and\r\nfat, but the people looked poor and half starved. The population was\r\nabout 2000. The island was not fertile. I tried to buy some beef, but\r\nthe pretext that it was wanted as medicine for sick sailors (a Japanese\r\nidea) was useless. Half the population was engaged in salt-burning; 1/2d\r\nand 1d banknotes were current, and very little coin was to be seen. At\r\none place we gave a man an _ichibu_, worth say 10d. He pretended to turn\r\nit over and look at it carefully, and then said \"these are very rare\r\nthings here.\"\r\n\r\nNext day we went round to the north side of the island and anchored\r\nthere. Here we again landed to visit the salt pans, and met with the\r\nsame friendly reception as before. On the 29th we crossed in one of the\r\nship's boats to Imi in Iyo, where the villagers refused to have anything\r\nto do with us, but at Takeda-tsu, a mile or two further west, they made\r\nno difficulties, and we were able to lay in a supply of pumpkins and\r\nbrinjalls. On the 1st August we weighed anchor before sunrise, and stood\r\naway towards the straits. The \"Barrosa\" anchored about ten miles on this\r\nside of Shimonoséki, and we went on in the \"Cormorant,\" steaming towards\r\nthe coast of Buzen and then up to Isaki Point. When half-way across the\r\nmouth of the straits we saw signal guns fired all along the north coast\r\nfrom Chôfu to Saho. After going nearly up to Tanoura, keeping carefully\r\nout of the range of the batteries, and cruising backwards and forwards\r\nfor a while, in order that the situation of the batteries and the number\r\nof guns might be accurately noted, we finally returned to Himéshima. We\r\nused to go on shore there for a walk every day, and found the people\r\ninquisitive but friendly. On one occasion, however, as we were returning\r\nthrough the village to our boats, we met a party of four _samurai_, who\r\nappeared to form part of a detachment sent over from Kitsuki in Buzen to\r\nprotect the island against a possible attack from us. I spoke civilly to\r\nthem, and asked where they had come from, but they answered in a surly\r\nmanner, \"from a distance.\" They looked as villainous a set as one could\r\nwish to see, and remained at the water's edge watching our movements\r\nuntil we got on board.\r\n\r\nOn the 6th August we made another trip to Shimonoséki in the \"Cormorant\"\r\nto reconnoitre, going in a little further than before in the direction\r\nof Tanoura. On this occasion, in addition to the signal guns, the\r\nbatteries fired a round shot and a shell as a warning, which fell in the\r\nsea about a mile ahead. When we got back to the \"Barrosa\" at half-past\r\nten in the evening we found Itô and Shiji had already returned. After\r\ndinner we had a long talk, and received the prince's answer. They\r\nbrought with them a single retainer, but said they had been accompanied\r\ndown to the coast by a guard of soldiers given them by their prince.\r\nThey commenced the delivery of the communication with which they were\r\ncharged by saying that they had found him at Yamaguchi, and had handed\r\nover the letters of the four foreign representatives to him in person.\r\nHe had then consulted with his chief retainers and come to the following\r\nconclusion: that he entirely acknowledged the truth of what was stated\r\nin the letters, and was conscious of his own inability to cope with the\r\nforces of western nations. But he was acting under orders which he had\r\nreceived, once from the Tycoon, and oftener from the Mikado, and not on\r\nhis own responsibility, and it was out of his power to reply to the\r\nforeign representatives without first receiving permission. It was his\r\nintention, therefore, to proceed to Kiôto in order to impress his own\r\nviews on the Mikado, which he calculated would take about three months.\r\nHe begged therefore that the powers would postpone operations for that\r\nperiod.\r\n\r\nThey brought no written documents with them, not even a letter to\r\ncertify that they were the accredited agents of their prince, but told\r\nus they could procure one if the vessels were delayed for two or three\r\ndays. They were informed that a mere verbal reply such as they had\r\nbrought could not be expected to satisfy the foreign representatives.\r\nThey then inquired whether they should send a written reply to Yokohama\r\nwith copies of the orders of the Tycoon and Mikado, but Captain Dowell\r\nreplied that their prince might do as he liked about that. His\r\ninstructions did not go so far as to enable him to express an opinion.\r\n\r\nIn private conversation they afterwards told me that their prince had\r\noriginally been favourable to foreigners, but had gone too far now in\r\nthe opposite direction to be able to retract, and they did not believe\r\nthat the matters at issue could be settled without fighting. They\r\nsuggested that it would be a good measure for the foreign\r\nrepresentatives to throw over the Tycoon, and proceeding to Ozaka,\r\ndemand an interview with the Mikado's ministers in order to conclude a\r\ndirect treaty with him. They spoke with great bitterness of the Tycoon's\r\ndynasty, accused them of keeping all the trade, both foreign and native,\r\nin their own hands, by taking possession of every place where trade was\r\nlikely to develope, such as Nagasaki and Niigata, and they said these\r\nfeelings were shared by most of the people. The way in which they\r\ndelivered their message made me suspect that it was couched in far more\r\nuncompromising terms than those which they made use of in communicating\r\nit. This was the first occasion on which I had been in full and frank\r\ncommunication with men belonging to the anti-Tycoon party. Their\r\nproposal that we should at once try to enter into negotiations with the\r\nMikado was a bold one, and calculated, if it had been adopted, rather to\r\ninjure than help their cause. The time was not yet ripe, for the\r\nShôgun's authority, though much weakened, was still admitted and obeyed\r\nby a large majority of the _daimiôs_. His troops had not as yet\r\nexhibited their inferiority in arms, and as a matter of fact almost at\r\nthis very moment the forces of the Prince of Chôshiû were suffering an\r\noverwhelming defeat in their attack upon Kiôto, which was defended in\r\nthe Tycoon's interest by Aidzu and Satsuma. By the time we returned to\r\nYokohama, and before the idea could have been even considered by the\r\nforeign representatives, Chôshiû's principal men were either fugitives\r\nor dead, and the Tycoon was temporarily master of the field.\r\n\r\nItô and his companion left again during the night. I could not help\r\nfeeling sorry for their failure to impress on their prince the warning\r\nwhich they had come all the way from Europe to impart. But there was no\r\nhelp for it. We weighed anchor early on the following morning and\r\narrived at Yokohama on the 10th.\r\n\r\nAs soon as it became known that Chôshiû would not give way preparations\r\nwere actively made for carrying out the resolutions previously agreed\r\nupon by the representatives of the four Powers. They held a conference\r\nwith the ministers of the Shôgun, in order to impress on them that the\r\nmoment had now come when the naval forces must be charged with the duty\r\nof opening the straits, but before the meeting had separated there came\r\nlike a thunderbolt on their deliberations an announcement of the return\r\nfrom Europe of a mission that had been despatched in the month of\r\nJanuary to treat with Great Britain and France. They brought with them a\r\nconvention concluded with the latter Power which provided for an\r\nindemnity in respect of the attack on the French gunboat, for the\r\nremoval by the Shôgun's government within three months of the\r\nimpediments to the navigation of the straits of Shimonoséki, for a\r\nmodification of the import tariff in favour of French manufactures, and\r\nfor the payment of an indemnity of $35,000 to the relatives of\r\nLieutenant Camus. This news seemed to Sir Rutherford Alcock to threaten\r\nan utter collapse of his plans, for if the convention were ratified, the\r\nFrench at least would be compelled to withdraw from the coalition. But\r\nit was of course clear to those on the spot that the second article\r\ncould not be possibly carried out by the Tycoon's government, and never\r\ncould have been seriously intended, at least on the Japanese side.\r\nPressure was therefore put on the council to make them declare that they\r\nwould not ratify the convention, and a note from them to this effect\r\nreached the foreign representatives on the 25th August. On the same day\r\nthey signed a memorandum declaring the necessity of a resort to force,\r\nwhich was then communicated to the naval commanders-in-chief, and four\r\ndays later the allied squadrons put to sea to carry into execution the\r\nplans decided on before the return of the envoys had for a moment seemed\r\nto threaten the disruption of the diplomatic union so strenuously worked\r\nfor by our chief. It was an immense responsibility that he had assumed.\r\nThere was no telegraph in those days to any point nearer than Ceylon,\r\nbut a despatch dated 26th July was already on its way to him positively\r\nprohibiting the adoption of military measures in the interior of Japan,\r\nand limiting naval operations against the Japanese Government or princes\r\nto defensive measures for the protection of the life and property of\r\nBritish subjects. By the time it reached his hands, his schemes had\r\nalready been accomplished with the happiest possible results, and he was\r\nable to console himself with the conviction that he had done the right\r\nthing, even though he might be censured for acting contrary to the\r\nwishes of Lord John Russell, and have incurred the penalty of a recall\r\nfrom his post.\r\n\r\nThe United States steamer \"Monitor\" had been fired at as she lay at\r\nanchor in a bay on the north coast of Nagato on July 11. This afforded\r\nfresh justification of the action adopted by the foreign\r\nrepresentatives.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER X\r\n\r\n                     SHIMONOSEKI--NAVAL OPERATIONS\r\n\r\n\r\nTO my great satisfaction I was appointed interpreter to Admiral Küper,\r\nand, packing up a few necessaries, embarked on board the \"Euryalus.\" I\r\nwas messed in the ward room, and as there was no cabin available, slept\r\non a sofa. The officers were a very pleasant set of fellows; among them\r\nI especially remember Tracey and Maclear, both of them now\r\npost-captains. The former is a very distinguished officer, but what\r\nparticularly attracted me towards him was his love of books, and his\r\nwide knowledge of modern languages, acquired by dint of sheer\r\nperseverance amid all the noisy distractions of life on board ship.\r\n\r\nThe \"Coquette\" was sent off to Nagasaki to bring up Sir Rutherford's\r\nstepson, Fred. Lowder, to be additional interpreter. The only other\r\ncivilian on board the flagship was Felix Beato, the well-known\r\nphotographer, who, making his first start in life with a camera in the\r\nCrimean war, had also accompanied the Anglo-French expedition to North\r\nChina in 1859, and had subsequently settled in Japan, where his social\r\nqualities had gained him many friends. My teacher Nakazawa had been\r\nsecretly taken away from me by the Tycoon's government as a punishment\r\nfor having accompanied me on the visit to Himéshima; many years\r\nafterwards I was made acquainted with the treachery of the foreigner who\r\nhad denounced him to the Commissioners for Foreign Affairs. But Willis\r\nlent me his Japanese instructor and pupil in medicine, Hayashi Bokuan,\r\nand I was able to make shift with this faithful man, though as a scholar\r\nhe was greatly inferior to Nakazawa.\r\n\r\nThe English squadron consisted of the flagship \"Euryalus,\" 35, commanded\r\nby Captain Alexander; the corvettes \"Tartar,\" 21, Captain Hayes;\r\n\"Barrosa,\" 21, Captain W. M. Dowell; the two-decker \"Conqueror,\" 48,\r\nCaptain Luard; the paddle-sloop \"Leopard,\" 18, Captain Leckie; the\r\npaddle-sloop \"Argus,\" 6, Commander Moresby; the \"Coquette,\" 14,\r\nCommander Roe; and gunboat \"Bouncer,\" 2, Lieutenant Holder. The French\r\nfrigate \"Sémiramis,\" 35, bearing the broad pennon of Admiral Jaurés, and\r\nthe American chartered steamer \"Takiang,\" carrying a Parrot gun and its\r\ncrew from the United States corvette \"Jamestown,\" under the command of\r\nLieutenant Pearson, accompanied us. The French corvette \"Dupleix,\" 10,\r\nand despatch boat \"Tancrède,\" 4, with the Dutch corvettes \"Metalen\r\nKruis,\" 16, Captain de Man; \"Djambi,\" 16, Captain van Rees; \"Amsterdam,\"\r\n8; and \"Medusa,\" 16, Captain de Casembroot, left the bay of Kanagawa on\r\nthe 28th August, and the remainder of the ships on the following day. We\r\nhad calm weather and a smooth sea on the way down, sighting the\r\nsouth-west corner of Shikoku on the 1st September. About 5 p.m. we fell\r\nin with the \"Perseus,\" 17, Commander Kingston, towing a collier, and\r\nbringing the Admiral's mail. The \"Perseus\" had met Commander Buckle in\r\nthe \"Cormorant\" on his way to Shanghai for the mail, who, having started\r\nfrom Yokohama about the time of the return of the Japanese embassy,\r\nreported that the expedition was indefinitely postponed; she had\r\ntherefore cast off the collier and steamed away at full speed for\r\nYokohama, but falling a little later in with the \"Coquette\" on her way\r\nto Nagasaki, learnt a very different tale, and turning round, had picked\r\nup the collier again and brought her on. On the following day we reached\r\nHiméshima and anchored a little after noon; here we found the \"Djambi\"\r\nand \"Metalen Kruis.\" Shortly afterwards the \"Medusa\" and the three\r\nFrench ships appeared, and by midnight every ship of the allied squadron\r\nhad arrived. We had still to wait for the \"Coquette,\" and either the\r\n\"Cormorant\" or \"Osprey.\"\r\n\r\nIn the afternoon the Admiral, Captain Alexander, with other officers,\r\nwent ashore for a walk, and I acted as their guide. The poor village\r\nmayor made his appearance in a great state of alarm. He was indeed in an\r\nuncomfortable position, uncertain of the disposition of the strangers,\r\nand sure of punishment from his own countrymen if he manifested too\r\ngreat friendliness towards us. He promised, however, to send us off some\r\nfish, \"quite privately,\" but was positive that he could sell no\r\nbullocks. He had despatched a messenger to Kitsuki to inquire whether\r\nthe islanders might hold intercourse with the squadron and furnish us\r\nwith what supplies they had.\r\n\r\nDuring the night we took in 150 tons of coal, and the 3rd of September\r\nwas spent by the rest of our squadron in replenishing their bunkers. In\r\nthe afternoon I went ashore to the mayor's house, where I found three of\r\nthe garrison from Kitsuki. They were very reticent, not to say sulky,\r\nand only one of them, who was evidently afraid of his companions, could\r\nbe induced to open his mouth. It was a grand sight to see the master of\r\nthe collier and his wife parading along the beach with a couple of dirty\r\nlittle village urchins running ahead of them. The common people were\r\nfriendly enough, except when the eyes of the two-sworded men were upon\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nOn the 4th September we weighed anchor at nine o'clock and proceeded\r\ntowards the straits of Shimonoséki, the eight British ships in the\r\ncentre, with \"Euryalus\" leading, the French squadron and the \"Takiang\"\r\nin a line on the left, and the four Dutch vessels on the right. It was a\r\nbeautiful show as the allied squadrons steamed in the consciousness of\r\nirresistible strength calmly across the unruffled surface of this inland\r\nsea, which lay before us like a glassy mirror in its framework of blue\r\nhills. Towards half past three we anchored at a distance of about two\r\nmiles from the mouth of the straits, and prepared for action. Everything\r\nwas in readiness by the time we had got half-way through our dinner, but\r\nto the disappointment of the more eager spirits, we remained where we\r\nwere without firing a shot. Every one was naturally very anxious that no\r\nnew complication should arise to delay the longed-for encounter with the\r\nenemy. Early on the following morning two Chôshiû men, common soldiers,\r\ncame on board to inquire why all these men-of-war had come to the\r\nstraits, but the Admiral refused to hold any parley with men of\r\nevidently inferior rank, and they were told to return on shore at once.\r\nOne of them told me very innocently that if we intended to go through he\r\nmust go on shore to make preparations for us, and when I asked what\r\npreparation, he said \"for fighting.\"\r\n\r\nI was then sent in a boat to overhaul a couple of junks that in the\r\nmeanwhile had been stopped as they were entering the straits. One was\r\nthe \"Isé Maru,\" of Matsuyama in Iyo, going to load coals at Hirado, the\r\nother belonged to Kurumé in Chikugo, and was returning from Ozaka with a\r\nmiscellaneous cargo. As they did not belong to the enemy we let them go.\r\n\r\nAbout two p.m. the two men who had previously visited the ship came on\r\nboard again to announce the arrival of a _bugiô_ or commissioner of some\r\nsort, accompanied by Inouyé Bunda (he had now laid aside his alias of\r\nShiji). But signals had already been made to the captains to take up the\r\npositions allotted to them for shelling the batteries, and when my\r\nfriend Inouyé and his companion reached the flagship the only answer\r\nthey received to their request that hostilities might be deferred with a\r\nview to negotiation was that the time for a peaceable arrangement had\r\npassed.\r\n\r\nWe went into action at ten minutes past four. The \"Barrosa,\" \"Tartar,\"\r\n\"Djambi,\" \"Metalen Kruis,\" \"Leopard,\" and \"Dupleix\" moved along the\r\nsouthern coast of the funnel-shaped entrance to the strait, and took up\r\ntheir station in front of Tanoura, as shown in the annexed plan, while a\r\nlight squadron consisting of the \"Perseus,\" \"Medusa,\" \"Tancrède,\"\r\n\"Coquette,\" and \"Bouncer\" passed along the northern shore, the\r\n\"Amsterdam\" and \"Argus\" being held in reserve. The \"Euryalus,\"\r\n\"Sémiramis,\" \"Conqueror,\" and \"Takiang\" anchored out of range of the\r\nenemy's batteries, at a distance of about 2500 yards from the central\r\ncluster at Maeda mura, and consequently near enough to reach them with\r\nour 110-pounder breech-loading Armstrong gun on the forecastle. The\r\nfirst shot was fired from the \"Euryalus,\" and the whole of the Tanoura\r\nsquadron then followed her example. The light squadron speedily silenced\r\nthe three-gun battery on Kushi Saki Point, but not before it had managed\r\nto pitch a shot pretty near the British flagship. Then the \"Sémiramis,\"\r\nwhich had been occupied in getting springs on her cable, opened fire\r\nfrom her quarter-deck guns with terrible effect, scarcely a shot falling\r\nshort. The \"Takiang\" did her best with her single gun, and the\r\n\"Conqueror\" fired three shells, one of which burst beautifully among the\r\ngreat cluster of batteries. The \"Euryalus\" fired only sixteen rounds\r\nbetween 4.10 and 5.10 p.m. from her 110-pounder, which was pretty good\r\nwork, considering that the vent piece got jammed once and a considerable\r\ntime was lost in digging it out with handspikes. Another time the vent\r\npiece was blown up into the fore-top owing to its not having been\r\nscrewed in tightly enough. The six vessels anchored south were soon\r\nengaged in a sharp conflict with the batteries opposite, while the light\r\nsquadron, having silenced the batteries on the north, came to their aid,\r\nenfilading the 4, 7, and 9-gun batteries. The furthest shot fired from\r\nthe \"Euryalus\" was at 4800 yards, and it went plump into a battery.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: THE STRAITS OF SHIMONOSEKI]\r\n\r\nBy 5.10 the principal batteries had been silenced, and a signal was made\r\nto discontinue firing. A fire now burst out among the buildings in the\r\nMaeda mura batteries and a magazine exploded, making the third \"blow-up\"\r\nduring the afternoon. We continued firing a shot now and then up to six\r\no'clock. The quarter-deck 40-pounder Armstrongs were fired once only, as\r\ntheir range proved to be too short, and none of the smooth-bore guns on\r\nthe main deck were brought into action, to the great disappointment of\r\nthe bluejackets, who had probably not forgotten the slaughter made\r\namongst their comrades at Kagoshima, and burned to avenge it. It must be\r\nadmitted that the Japanese fought well and with great persistence, for I\r\nattach no value to the story that was told that the gunners were only\r\nallowed to fire once, and were then replaced by fresh men. At first many\r\nof our shot fell short, but when the range was found, they struck the\r\nbatteries every moment, as we could see by the clouds of dust that were\r\nknocked up. After the signal to discontinue firing had been made,\r\nKingston of the \"Perseus\" and De Casembroot of the \"Medusa\" landed and\r\nspiked fourteen guns in the Maeda mura batteries. At the small battery\r\non Kushi Saki Point two out of the three guns had been dismounted by our\r\nfire. The entire casualties on our side this first day were six men\r\nwounded in the \"Tartar,\" which bore the brunt of the fire.\r\n\r\nEarly on the following morning one of the Maeda mura batteries re-opened\r\nfire on the squadron anchored off Tanoura, but was replied to with such\r\neffect that it was speedily silenced, and the barrack behind was set on\r\nfire. The \"Dupleix\" lost two killed and two wounded, while the first\r\nlieutenant of the \"Tartar\" was struck by a round shot on the posteriors\r\nand severely wounded. He recovered, however, contrary to the\r\nexpectations of the surgeons. I slept through the noise, but was woke by\r\nsomebody with a message that I had to land with Captain Alexander, who\r\nwas to command the small-arms party of the \"Euryalus,\" 200 strong. From\r\nthe \"Conqueror\" there landed the battalion of 450 marines under Colonel\r\nSuther, besides her own complement of 100, and some bluejackets, small\r\ndetachments of marines being added from the other ships of our squadron.\r\nThe French landed 350, and the Dutch 200. Another calculation showed\r\nthat 1900 men were put ashore, of whom we furnished 1400.\r\n\r\nWe rowed straight for the nearest land, followed by a string of cutters\r\nand pinnaces so full of men that there was only just room to work the\r\noars, and got on shore at nine o'clock exactly. The task assigned to\r\nCaptain Alexander's party was to scale a bluff immediately to the east\r\nof the Maeda mura batteries, and take a one-gun battery. It was a stiff\r\npull up the steep grassy hill, but up went the bluejackets pell-mell, as\r\nif they were out on a picnic, every man for himself. On climbing over\r\nthe earthwork we found that the gun had been either carried off or\r\nconcealed. There were a score or so of the enemy on the platform, who\r\nretreated as soon as the first of our people showed his nose above the\r\nparapet, but they kept up a dropping fire from the other side of the\r\nhill. Here one of our men received a bullet wound in the leg, and a\r\nsecond was accidentally shot through the body by the sailor immediately\r\nbehind him. Passing through the battery, we clambered up the hill\r\nbehind, through a tangled brake of ferns and creepers. The heat was\r\nintense. It was a difficult job to keep one's footing on the narrow path\r\ncut through the slippery grass. Our bluejackets were very eager to get\r\nat the enemy, but not a single one was to be seen. Descending the other\r\nside of the hill, we at last found ourselves in a sort of covered way,\r\nwhich ran along the side of a narrow valley. It was reported that the\r\nenemy were posted further up the valley in considerable numbers, but\r\ninstead of pursuing them we turned to the left along the covered way,\r\nwhich brought us down past a magazine into the central battery of the\r\nprincipal group. It turned out afterwards to be a fortunate\r\ncounter-march, for if we had proceeded in the other direction we should\r\nhave stumbled on a stockade defended by three field guns, which would\r\nhave played \"Old Harry\" with our small force.\r\n\r\nThe first battery we entered was already in the possession of the French\r\nlanding party and some of our marines, who, having disembarked below the\r\nbluff, had marched along the beach, meeting with no opposition. This\r\nwork was of earth, having a parapet about twenty feet wide, armed along\r\nthe edge with a chevaux-de-frise of pointed bamboo stakes. In battery\r\nNo. 7 the guns were mounted en barbette, on carriages with enormous\r\nwheels, and worked on pivots. They were of bronze, very long, and threw\r\na 32-pound shot, though marked as 24's. They bore a Japanese date\r\ncorresponding to 1854, and had evidently been cast in Yedo. Besides\r\nthese, there was a short 32-pounder, and on the other side of a\r\ntraverse, containing a small magazine, was a single 10-inch gun, also of\r\nbronze. We upset them all, broke up the carriages, threw the shot and\r\nshell into the sea, burned the powder, and even dragged a couple of guns\r\ndown on to the beach. This occupied us till three or four o'clock in the\r\nafternoon. During this time our men were perpetually firing musketry at\r\nthe enemy on the hill, who every now and then showed themselves to give\r\nus a shot or two. In the 9-gun battery were a couple of heavy 11-inch\r\nbronze guns. Afterwards we proceeded to the next battery, which was\r\nalmost _à fleur d' eau_. It was divided into two by a traverse\r\ncontaining a magazine, on one side of which were one 10-inch howitzer,\r\ntwo 32-pounders, and one 24-pounder; on the other side were the same\r\nnumber, with the addition of a single 24-pounder. These likewise were\r\noverturned, and the carriages and ammunition disposed of as before. The\r\nJapanese field battery up the valley, which had been advanced some\r\nlittle way from the stockade along a path leading towards Maeda mura,\r\nDannoura and Shimonoséki annoyed us considerably during this operation,\r\nfiring shells over us and at long ranges into the sea, while their\r\nmusketeers kept up a pretty constant fire, though no one was touched on\r\nour side. Part of our men were told off to keep them in check, but our\r\naim was not much better than that of the enemy. The great thing in war,\r\nuntil you come to close quarters, seems to be to make as much noise as\r\nyou can to put your foes in a funk, or in other words to demoralize\r\nthem. You can't do much harm, and it was laughable to see how many of\r\nour men ducked to avoid the shot, and I confess I followed their example\r\nuntil reason came to my aid.\r\n\r\nThe \"Medusa\" moved up and threw a few shells in among them, while the\r\n\"Perseus,\" \"Amsterdam,\" and \"Argus\" fired over the hill from their\r\nstation before Tanoura. This quieted the zeal of our warrior foes for a\r\nwhile, and we returned to the first battery we had dismantled, for the\r\nmen to have their dinners. Crowdy of the Engineers, McBean the\r\nassistant-surgeon of the flagship and I divided a loaf of bread and a\r\ntin of sardines, which we opened with Crowdy's sword. There were no\r\nknives or forks handy, but that did not hinder us from satisfying our\r\nwell-earned appetite as we sat on the steps of the magazine in the\r\ntraverse. After dinner we helped the French to overturn the guns in\r\ntheir battery, which were four in number, very long 32-pounders, mounted\r\non field carriages. The enemy still continued annoying us from their\r\nposition up the valley, while some of our men kept up a fitful musketry\r\nfire in reply, without much damage on either side.\r\n\r\nThe afternoon being already far advanced, the signal to re-embark was\r\nmade from the \"Euryalus,\" and the French and Dutch detachments, some of\r\nthe marine detachment, and the \"Conqueror's\" small-arms men, were\r\nalready in their boats, when about six o'clock we saw Colonel Suther's\r\nbattalion of marines returning from the Maeda mura 15-gun battery\r\nthrough a heavy fire from the Japanese. The Japanese on perceiving them\r\nthrew a round shot in among them, but without doing any harm; our men\r\nreplied, and for fifteen minutes there was nothing but ping, ping, ping\r\non both sides. At last the Colonel came up to Captain Alexander and\r\nsaid:--\"Where are these men who are annoying us. I've enough men to take\r\nany battery.\" \"All right,\" replied Alexander, \"I'll take the left side\r\nof the valley and you the right.\" So the marines clambered up into the\r\nFrench battery (the eastern-most one) and proceeded up the covered way,\r\nwhile the \"Conqueror's\" men disembarked again, and the advance\r\ncommenced. Beato and I stuck close to Alexander, and followed the\r\nbluejackets across the paddyfields by the narrow \"bunds,\" and then along\r\nthe path on the western side of the valley. How the bluejackets shouted\r\nand cheered, each man running on by himself, now stopping to take aim at\r\nan enemy from behind one of the pine trees that lined the edge of the\r\nroad, and then on again. There was no order or discipline. Some of them\r\nwasted their ammunition on imaginary foes on the hillsides. I passed\r\nseveral wounded men as I went up, some seriously hurt, and the corpse of\r\na sailor who had been killed by an arrow.\r\n\r\nAt last we reached the battery, whence the gunners had been driven by\r\nour fire, dismounted the guns and threw them into the paddyfield close\r\nby, after destroying the carriages. Here Alexander was wounded by a ball\r\nwhich passed through the ankle-joint of his right foot, and he had to be\r\ncarried to the rear on a stretcher. From this point the valley\r\ncontracted rapidly, while immediately in front of us was a stockaded\r\nbarrack into which most of the Japanese retreated, turning back\r\nrepeatedly to fire. But I saw others in black armour and white surcoats\r\nretreating with great rapidity along the road to the left. Lieutenant\r\nEdwards and Crowdy of the Engineers were ahead with a middy named D. G.\r\nBoyes, who carried the colours most gallantly; he afterwards received\r\nthe V.C. for conduct very plucky in one so young. When I got up to the\r\nfront of the stockade there were three or four dead Japanese lying about\r\nand one of our men, shot through the heart. He presented a most ghastly\r\nsight as he lay there, getting visibly bluer and bluer, without any\r\nexterior signs of blood to show how he had come by his death. Having\r\ndirected some of the men to put his corpse into a huge oblong basket\r\nwhich was on the ground close by and carry him off, I passed on into the\r\nstockade whence the Japanese had already fled. In retiring they had set\r\nfire to some houses close to the magazine, with the amiable intention of\r\nblowing us up, but the train was discovered and the explosion prevented.\r\n\r\nAfter ranging over the whole place and removing whatever was worth\r\ncarrying off as trophies, such as armour, bows and arrows, spears and\r\nswords, and bayonets bearing a foreign maker's name, we set fire to the\r\nbuildings and retired in good order. The loss of the enemy was about\r\ntwenty killed, but they had carried off all their wounded. We had five\r\nkilled and thirteen or fourteen wounded, two mortally. What the marine\r\nbattalion was doing all this time I cannot say, for the excitement about\r\nwhat was going on ahead left me no disposition to look elsewhere, but I\r\nrather think that having marched along the covered way with great\r\nsteadiness they managed to arrive just as the more active and impetuous\r\n\"jacks\" had finished the business. And no blame to them either for going\r\nabout their work in a business-like manner. If we had met with a check\r\nin our heedless, headlong advance, the marines would have saved us from\r\ndestruction. It was lucky for us that the skirmish terminated as it did,\r\nfor our loss in small-arms' men would have been much greater if the\r\nJapanese had been strong enough to stand to their guns, or had posted\r\nmarksmen on the hills to take us in flank as we hurried up the valley.\r\nThey had the advantage in position, besides possessing seven small field\r\npieces, while on the other hand we had at least a couple of hundred men\r\nin excess of their number, which it was supposed was 600. But I fancy I\r\nremember having heard since from a Chôshiû man who was present that\r\ntheir force was only one half of that. The bluejackets bore the brunt of\r\nthe business, as they had to cross the line of fire and to advance along\r\nthe outer edge of the horn-shaped valley, which curved away to the east\r\nout of sight of the shipping. The Japanese could not stand our advance,\r\nthe sharp musketry fire threw them into disorder, and they had to run\r\nfor it. In only one case was an attempt made to come to close quarters.\r\nOne fellow had concealed himself behind a door with uplifted sword in\r\nboth hands, ready to cut down a man just about to enter. But contrary to\r\nhis expectation, his intended victim gave him a prod in the belly which\r\nlaid him on his back and spoilt his little game. Our French companions\r\nin arms were disgusted at not having been present at the affair, and\r\nturned up their noses at it, as _pas grand chose après tout_. It was the\r\nfortune of war, and we commiserated them sincerely.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: INTERIOR OF A JAPANESE BATTERY AFTER THE LANDING\r\n    OF THE ALLIED NAVAL FORCES]\r\n\r\nThe marines who in the first instance marched on Maeda mura had one man\r\nkilled and two wounded. They dismantled fifteen guns in the battery\r\nthere.\r\n\r\nDuring the day a boat belonging to one of the Dutch men-of-war, with two\r\nmen in her, got loose and drifted down with the tide towards the town.\r\nThey were immediately shot, though quite defenceless. Fred Lowder and\r\nhis brother George, who had come up with him from Nagasaki \"to see the\r\nfun,\" had a narrow escape as they were paddling about in a Japanese\r\nboat, which became unmanageable and was drifting off in the same\r\ndirection; they jumped into the water and swam ashore, or they would\r\nprobably have encountered the same fate.\r\n\r\nThe eastern end of the town of Shimonoséki (more properly speaking, I\r\nbelieve, Akamagaséki) was set on fire, but the number of houses burnt\r\nwas extremely small. It was alleged that this was done by the French\r\nbecause some Japanese soldiers had fired thence on their men, but I do\r\nnot know whether this is a fact. The \"Perseus\" ran ashore opposite the\r\nnearest batteries, and as the tide ebbed her bow was high out of the\r\nwater, nor did she get off again until the following day.\r\n\r\nI found myself on board again at half-past seven o'clock, very dirty,\r\nvery tired, very hungry and very thirsty.\r\n\r\nOn the 7th September working parties of bluejackets landed under the\r\nprotection of some marines to take possession of the guns, ten of which\r\nthey got into the boats. Others went up to the stockade and found some\r\nfield pieces, which they destroyed, hove down wells, or brought away. We\r\ngot together sixty, all but one of bronze, with two mortars and six\r\ncohorns. We blew up all the powder and threw the shot and shell into the\r\nsea. There was not a single hostile Japanese to be seen. The \"Perseus\"\r\nhad to be lightened by discharging all her guns and coals, and so\r\nmanaged to get afloat by noon.\r\n\r\nOur list of casualties during the two days' operation was eight killed\r\nand thirty wounded, of whom one or two were not expected to live. We\r\nlanded at half-past one on the Tanoura side to bury our dead, the French\r\nhaving already buried two in the forenoon. In digging the graves our men\r\nfound particles of a glittering substance which was at first taken to be\r\ngold dust, but turned out to be mica. I met a party of Ogasawara's\r\ntwo-sworded men, who asked how many dead we had, and how we had fared on\r\nthe previous day. On learning what a complete thrashing we had given the\r\nenemy at the stockade, they expressed great satisfaction, and recounted\r\nhow the Chôshiû people had crossed over the straits in the previous\r\nyear, cut down their crops, carried off their live stock, and driven the\r\npeasants away, after which they held possession of Tanoura for some\r\ntime, until public opinion and the necessity of providing for the\r\ndefence of Chôshiû's own territories had compelled them to withdraw.\r\nOgasawara's men feared that when Chôshiû came to find out that\r\ncommunication had taken place between us and the Buzen folk, he would\r\nvisit them again after the withdrawal of the squadron, but I boldly\r\nassured them that they need not alarm themselves, as we intended to\r\ndestroy the batteries, and deprive Chôshiû of his territory. For I knew\r\nthat part of the plan entertained by Sir Rutherford and his colleagues\r\nwas the seizure of a sufficient piece of territory near Shimonoséki as a\r\nmaterial guarantee for the payment of an adequate indemnity, and to hold\r\nit until it could be conveniently handed over to the Tycoon's\r\ngovernment.\r\n\r\nSir Rutherford contemplated nothing less than the complete subjugation\r\nof the Chôshiû clan, and he had enjoined upon the Admiral the necessity\r\nof attacking Hagi, which was supposed to be the stronghold of the\r\n_daimiô_. The Admiral, however, who was a prudent commander, and by no\r\nmeans disposed to take orders from the civil representatives of Her\r\nMajesty further than he was obliged, came to the conclusion that the\r\nresources at his disposal did not permit of a permanent occupation of\r\nany portion of Chôshiû's territory, and considered that as soon as the\r\nforts were destroyed and the straits opened, his task was accomplished.\r\nFear had made the Ogasawara _samurai_ wondrously polite. The villagers\r\nwere also friendly enough, and I made them laugh good-humouredly with\r\nsome commonplace jokes, but did not succeed in inducing them to sell any\r\nsupplies. The officials, after hunting all through the village, as they\r\nassured us, produced eight or ten eggs, which they said was all they\r\ncould find. Our bluejackets brought me some papers which they had picked\r\nup in the stockade, and which appeared to contain evidences of plots by\r\nChôshiû against the Mikado, also quantities of pills made, or said to be\r\nmade, from bear's gall, and banknotes for small sums, such as were\r\ncommonly used in the territories of all the _daimiôs_. I believe that\r\nsilver coin was current at that time in the dominions of the Tycoon\r\nalone.\r\n\r\nOn the 8th, fatigue parties landed again to bring off more guns; we got\r\nall but two from the group of batteries, which made nineteen, besides\r\nfifteen from Maeda mura and an equal number from the batteries on\r\nHikushima, the large island in the western entrance of the straits. I\r\nwent on shore to Maeda mura, and found a well built battery, with a\r\nparapet twenty feet wide cased with stone towards the sea, and divided\r\ninto four sections by traverses, between which the guns were planted in\r\nunequal numbers. In the rear stood a stone-built magazine, the roof of\r\nwhich had been smashed by a round shot that went right through it. The\r\npowder magazine, also of stone, which stood on one side of the valley\r\nbehind, had been blown up the previous day. Further up was a stockaded\r\nbarrack, which the French had burned. I went towards the advanced guard\r\nnear the town, but as the enemy began to show themselves and fire at us,\r\nI made a prudent retreat.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER XI\r\n\r\n               SHIMONOSEKI; PEACE CONCLUDED WITH CHÔSHIÛ\r\n\r\n\r\nReturning to the ship at noon, I found there my acquaintance Itô\r\nShunsuké, who had come to say that Chôshiû desired peace, and that a\r\n_karô_ or hereditary councillor, provided with full powers, was coming\r\noff to treat. A boat was accordingly despatched to meet the great man,\r\nwho shortly afterwards stood on the quarter-deck of the flagship. He was\r\ndressed in a robe called the _daimon_, which was covered with large\r\nlight blue crests (the paulownia leaf and flower) on a yellow ground,\r\nand wore on his head a black silk cap, which he took off on passing the\r\ngangway. His queue was then seen to be loose, hanging over the back of\r\nhis head like a tassel, and his white silk underclothing was a marvel of\r\npurity. His two companions, who bore a rank next only to his own, wore\r\ntheir hair in the same fashion, but were without mantles. They were\r\nconducted into the cabin, and presented to the Admirals, the Abbé\r\nGirard, Lowder and myself acting as interpreters. They began by stating\r\nthat the Prince of Chôshiû acknowledged his defeat, and desired to make\r\npeace with a view to the establishment of friendly relations. The\r\nAdmiral thereupon asked to see their credentials, and finding they had\r\nnone, intimated that he would give them forty-eight hours to provide\r\nthemselves with a letter from their _daimiô_. They were told that the\r\nletter must contain the substance of what they had said, acknowledging\r\nthat he had committed a grievous wrong in firing upon foreign ships, and\r\nbegging for peace, that it must be signed with his own hand and sealed\r\nwith his seal, and that a copy must be addressed to each of the four\r\nsenior naval officers in command.\r\n\r\nThe conditions imposed were--first, that we should continue to remove\r\nthe guns and destroy the forts; second, that we would discontinue\r\nhostilities, they on their side doing the same, but that if they fired\r\nanother shot we should burn everything we could lay our hands on in\r\nChôshiû's territories; third, they must deliver up intact the Dutch\r\nsailors and boat which had fallen into their hands on the 6th; and\r\nfourth, that they should endeavour to induce the villagers to bring off\r\npoultry and fresh vegetables for sale. In order that they might have a\r\ntoken of a peaceable disposition on our part, a white flag should be\r\nhoisted at the main until the expiration of the time fixed for their\r\nreturn. They gave as their names Shishido Giôma, adopted son of Shishido\r\nBizen, minister of Nagato; Sugi Tokusuké and Watanabé Kurata,\r\ncouncillors. They then returned on shore, leaving communications\r\naddressed to each of the commanders of the allied squadron, which they\r\nhad been charged to deliver at Himéshima before the bombardment. They\r\nhanded these over at the Admiral's desire, remarking that we should\r\nperceive from the contents that the documents were useless now.\r\n\r\nItô gave me also transcripts of the orders received from the Mikado and\r\nthe Tycoon to expel foreigners from Japan, which Shishido certified with\r\nhis own hand to be true copies. The translations made of these papers\r\nwere afterwards published in the bluebook on Japan, where the curious\r\ncan consult them. There is no doubt that they were perfectly authentic.\r\nIt was amusing to observe the change which manifested itself gradually\r\nin the demeanour of the envoy, who was as proud as Lucifer when he\r\nstepped on board, but gradually toned down, and agreed to every proposal\r\nwithout making any objections. Itô seemed to exercise great influence\r\nover him. After the truce was agreed to, the country people ventured\r\nfreely along the road near the batteries, and passed on into the town,\r\nno doubt heartily pleased at the termination of hostilities. It must be\r\nsaid to their credit that the terms were faithfully adhered to by the\r\nChôshiû people, none of whom, except Itô and Inouyé, had supposed\r\nEuropeans to be any better than mere barbarians.\r\n\r\nOn the 9th September the \"Coquette\" took the two Admirals through the\r\nstraits to visit the batteries on Hikushima, and as usual I accompanied\r\nthem to interpret. From the eastern side the strait contracts rapidly,\r\nbetween lofty well-wooded hills, to a width of no more than six cables'\r\nlengths, and then as quickly opens out again, with the long line of\r\nhouses forming the town of Shimonoséki on the northern shore, while to\r\nthe left the coast trends away southwards past the village of Moji and\r\nthe town of Kokura. In front lay the broad undulating Hikushima. Passing\r\nright out through the strait till we reached the north-west corner of\r\nthe island, we turned back again and came along its coast, passing a\r\nlittle cove crowded with junks, till we came to Lime Point. Here we\r\ndisembarked to inspect the site of the batteries, from which the guns\r\nhad already been removed by our people. One of the batteries, which\r\noriginally had six guns mounted, was cut out of the cliff, and there had\r\nevidently not been time to complete it. Immediately below the parapet\r\nwas a single gun in a pit. A little further east was a battery of eight\r\nguns mounted _à fleur d'eau_, and close by was a smaller battery with\r\nfour embrasures which had never been armed. The only other sign of a\r\nbattery on this island was an old earthwork to the west of Lime Point,\r\nalso without guns. Kokura appeared to be strongly fortified, and it was\r\nreported that the Chôshiû people had demanded, but unsuccessfully, to be\r\nallowed to work the batteries against us. The \"Tartar,\" \"Dupleix,\"\r\n\"Djambi,\" and \"Metalen Kruis\" had been stationed here since the 7th,\r\nchiefly for the purpose of dismantling the batteries.\r\n\r\nLeaving them we steamed up to Kushi saki Point, where three brass and\r\nfour _wooden_ guns had been taken. The latter were about four feet long,\r\nand were constructed of single logs with a bore about eight inches in\r\ndiameter, having a chamber behind capable of holding about a pound and a\r\nhalf of powder. Bamboo hoops surrounded the gun from breech to muzzle,\r\nthen came a layer of boards, and then more bamboo hoops; the wood itself\r\nwas only about 3-1/2 in. thick. The shot consisted of a small bag of\r\npebbles fastened to a wooden disk, and was intended to act like grape at\r\nclose quarters against a landing party. These curious weapons were\r\nsimply laid on the earthen parapet, and were not calculated to be used\r\nmore than once.\r\n\r\nThe Japanese had shown themselves very friendly to the working party,\r\nand had themselves carried down the guns for delivery. They were not\r\nimprobably glad to get rid of the toys that had brought them into so\r\nmuch trouble. On returning to the flagship we found a couple of boats\r\nladen with fowls and vegetables which Shiji Bunda had sent on board as a\r\npresent. There was a note from him saying that the common people were\r\nmuch too frightened to come near us to sell supplies, and complaining\r\nthat one of the ships had been firing again, an action which, he said,\r\nwould tend to endanger the friendly relations so recently established.\r\nBut this was a mistake on his part, for no incident of the kind had\r\noccurred. The bumboatmen were shown over the ship, and expressed\r\nthemselves much delighted with the novel and wonderful sight. We sent\r\nhalf of Shiji's present to the French Admiral, and our share was divided\r\namong the officers and men of the flagship.\r\n\r\nOn the following day the envoys of the Prince of Chôshiû arrived\r\npunctually on board the \"Euryalus.\" Shishido and Sugi, however, did not\r\nmake their appearance, their absence being explained to be caused by\r\nillness from want of sleep and the hot weather in combination. Admiral\r\nKüper observed that it was singular how often this sort of thing\r\nhappened, and ironically begged that if the negotiations were not\r\nconcluded in one sitting, the delegates would take care of their health\r\nuntil everything was settled. Their names were Môri Idzumo, Minister\r\n(_Karô_) 'Yamada Uyemon, Hadano Kingo (Hadano was afterwards better\r\nknown as Hirozawa Hiôsuké) and Watanabé Kurata, councillors (_sansei_),\r\nand Isota Kenzô and Harata Junji of Chôfu, councillors, with Shiji\r\nBunda. We had looked up the Japanese \"blue-book\" in the meantime, and\r\nfancied we had reason to suppose the previous envoy had given an\r\nincorrect account of his position, but they were able to clear up the\r\ndiscrepancy in a satisfactory manner. The officer there called Shishido\r\nMino had recently changed his name to Shishido Bizen, and retired from\r\npublic life in favour of Giôma, who now represented the family. They\r\nproduced a letter from their prince which, on being read, was found to\r\ndeclare in satisfactory terms that he sued for peace. The Admiral then\r\nsaid: \"We quite agree with your prince in desiring peace. It was never\r\nour intention to fight your countrymen. We solely desire to cement\r\namicable relations between Japan and foreign countries, and to carry on\r\ntrade.\"\r\n\r\nMôri replied that these were entirely the views held by the prince.\r\n\r\n_Ad. Küper_--\"Do you wish us distinctly to understand that you will\r\noffer no further opposition to the free passage of the straits?\"\r\n\r\n_Môri_--\"We do.\"\r\n\r\n_Ad. Küper_--\"We should like very much to have an interview with the\r\nprince, for we could concede much to him that we could not perhaps\r\nconcede to you. We are ourselves of high rank in our own country, but\r\nwill come on shore to meet him at Shimonoséki.\"\r\n\r\nAfter consulting among themselves they named the 14th September as the\r\ndate on which he should come down from his capital to receive the two\r\nAdmirals in the town.\r\n\r\n_Ad. Küper_--\"We will first state our demands, which can be ratified by\r\nthe prince when he comes. We shall then be able to explain to him many\r\nmatters connected with the customs of foreign countries which will\r\nprevent mistakes arising in future. In any case the transaction of\r\nbusiness will be facilitated and time will be saved by the prince's\r\ncoming, as in any case his ratification has to be obtained to the terms\r\nagreed on.\"\r\n\r\n\"In the first place, no batteries must be constructed in the straits\r\nuntil all questions between foreigners and Japanese have been settled by\r\nthe Tycoon's government and the foreign ministers at Yedo.\"\r\n\r\n\"Secondly, according to the custom of foreign nations in time of war, a\r\nransom for the town of Shimonoséki must be paid, because we spared it\r\nwhen we had a perfect right to set it on fire, for our people had been\r\nfired on from the houses. The amount shall be communicated to the prince\r\nhimself at the conference which is to take place.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thirdly, when foreign vessels passing through the straits are in need\r\nof coals, provisions, or water, they shall be permitted to purchase what\r\nthey want.\"\r\n\r\nThese conditions were readily accepted by the envoy, who said that as\r\nthe tides were very strong in the straits, and both wind and waves\r\nsometimes violent, persons in distress should be permitted to land.\r\n\r\nThe Admiral then informed him that during our stay we should go on shore\r\nat Shimonoséki to buy whatever we required, and requested him to tell\r\nthe townspeople to bring together for sale what they could, in fact to\r\nstart a market for the fleet. To this they at first objected, on the\r\nground that the town had been completely abandoned by its inhabitants,\r\nbut eventually agreed to do what was desired. Then Môri got up, and\r\nleaning over to me said confidentially that there was one thing about\r\nwhich he was very anxious. The peace they had obtained was a most\r\nprecious and valuable thing, and they would greatly regret if any\r\nuntoward event were to injure our present friendly relations. It might\r\nhappen that an ill-disposed person would lie in wait to attack\r\nforeigners, and, to prevent anything of this kind occurring, he begged\r\nthat those who went ashore would be on their guard. This was interpreted\r\nto Admiral Küper, who at once replied that we had no fear of any such\r\nevilly disposed persons, but that if a single European were hurt, the\r\nwhole town should be burnt to the ground. The Japanese authorities, he\r\nadded, were in the habit of saying this sort of thing, solely to prevent\r\nour landing, and it looked to him a little suspicious.\r\n\r\nMôri answered that he feared the purity of his intentions in giving this\r\nwarning was not understood. He was sure the Japanese authorities would\r\non their part take every precaution to prevent mishaps, and he had only\r\nmentioned this to prevent mistakes.\r\n\r\n_Ad. Küper_--\"Very well. We shall not go into the country at all. No\r\ndoubt there is a governor in the town. You can give orders to him to\r\nkeep out the ill-disposed, and if he cannot defend the place, we will\r\nland and do it for him.\"\r\n\r\n_Môri_--\"We will give orders to the governor.\"\r\n\r\nThis finished the business part of the conference, but the Admiral was\r\ncurious to know the details of what had recently taken place at Kiôto,\r\nwhere it was reported there had been fighting between the Chôshiû and\r\nAidzu men. Thereupon Shiji told us a long story, the gist of which was\r\nthat after Chôshiû had received the orders of both the Mikado and Tycoon\r\nfor \"the expulsion of the foreigners,\" and had acted upon them to the\r\nbest of his ability, he got a great deal of abuse for having done so.\r\nBeing both surprised and hurt at this treatment, he sent several times\r\nto Kiôto to inquire the reason, but his people were driven out of the\r\ncapital, and he was forbidden to present himself there again. He became\r\nindignant at this injustice, and his retainers sympathized with him very\r\nstrongly. At last a band of them, who could bear it no longer, set out\r\nfor Kiôto to demand an explanation from the Mikado's ministers. They\r\ntook swords, spears, and other warlike weapons in their hands. For why?\r\nOn a former occasion, nay twice, Aidzu had put to death every Chôshiû\r\nman to be found in Kiôto. So, said they, \"Aidzu may attack us also, and\r\nthen we must defend ourselves; we will not be killed for nothing.\" The\r\nprince, happening to hear of their departure, sent three of his\r\nministers (_karô_) to recall them, but they refused to return. Then the\r\ngovernor of Kiôto summoned Chôshiû's agent at the capital to send the\r\nmen home again, \"for if you don't,\" said he, \"I shall attack them.\"\r\nHowever, the agent refused, and a battle ensued. When the \"Barrosa\" came\r\nthe first time to Himéshima with the letters of the foreign\r\nrepresentatives, the prince despatched his son to communicate with the\r\nMikado, but owing to the disturbed state of affairs he was unable to\r\neffect anything. Shiji hoped we would not believe that the Chôshiû clan\r\nharboured any treasonable intentions towards the Mikado, and the whole\r\ntruth was that they had simply tried to get an explanation of the manner\r\nin which they had been treated. He added that we ought not to put any\r\ntrust in what was told us by the Kokura people or the junk sailors, who\r\ncame from Yedo and Hizen and all parts of the country, and were enemies\r\nof Chôshiû.\r\n\r\nOur visitors were then conducted over the ship, and after being\r\nentertained with some music by the band they went over the side, and we\r\nparted on very friendly terms.\r\n\r\nA comparison of dates with the account given in Adams, chapters 25 and\r\n26, of what had passed at Kiôto during the summer, shows that the\r\nChôshiû clansmen were marching from Ozaka to Kiôto at the very time that\r\nItô and Shiji landed from the \"Barrosa\" and reached Yamaguchi to convey\r\nthe messages of the foreign representatives to the princes. From time to\r\ntime other bodies of Chôshiû men reached the capital, and the\r\naccumulated elements of civil war finally exploded on the 20th August,\r\nbefore the younger prince of Chôshiû, who seems to have really started\r\nfrom home to calm the excited spirits of the clansmen with news of a new\r\nenemy in their rear, had time to arrive. The best fighting men were\r\nconsequently absent when the allied squadron appeared at the straits,\r\nand our victory was therefore a much easier affair than it would\r\notherwise have been. I doubt whether any of the fugitives from Kiôto got\r\nhome in time to take part in the defence of the place.\r\n\r\nNext day Captain Hayes of the \"Tartar,\" Major Wray, R.E., and I went\r\nashore for a walk through Shimonoséki. The eastern end of the town had\r\nreceived a good many round shot on the 6th September, and some of the\r\nhouses were almost knocked to pieces. I believe the Chôshiû men had\r\nbrought out a field piece or two and fired from that point against the\r\nsquadron lying in front of Tanoura. This had drawn on them our heavy\r\nartillery. The townspeople were flocking back, and had commenced to\r\nsettle down again, but very few shops were open. The common people\r\nfollowed us in crowds, and appeared very friendly, but the prices asked\r\nby the shopkeepers were exorbitant. We were somewhat surprised, though\r\nof course without reason, to find that the proportion of _curio_ shops\r\nwas very small as compared with Yokohama. We saw several soldiers, some\r\narmed with rifles, others carrying swords and spears; they of course\r\ncould not be expected to look very amicably at their late foes.\r\n\r\nOn the 12th, Hadano and the two governors of the town came off to tell\r\nthe Admiral that a market would be opened at a wharf called Nabéhama\r\nfrom ten to twelve in the forenoon for the sale of fresh provisions. We\r\nof course suspected them of having made this arrangement in order to\r\nhave everything under their own control, and to keep the prices as high\r\nas possible. The Admiral demanded a market from six to eight o'clock, to\r\nwhich after much discussion they agreed. I learnt through my teacher\r\nthat the people were told to sell dearly to us, in spite of the promise\r\ngiven to us by the officials that they would not interfere. The latter\r\nhad begged that our men might be ordered not to purchase anything in the\r\nshops, on the ground that we should buy up all the provisions intended\r\nfor the townsfolk.\r\n\r\nOn the 13th, Captain Dowell transferred to the \"Euryalus\" as\r\nflag-captain, vice captain Alexander invalided. Next day I accompanied\r\nthe two Admirals on shore to the clean little village of Moji. On asking\r\nsome Kokura men whom we met to show us the way up to the battery on the\r\npoint where the strait sweeps round, they inquired whether we had\r\npermission from the guard established at a temple close by. The answer\r\nto this astounding query was that we were not in the habit of asking\r\nleave. \"Was that the path?\" \"Yes, that's the path.\" So we toiled up a\r\nhill through the pine trees, turned to the left, and descended into the\r\nbattery, which was constructed for three guns. It commanded a view right\r\nup and down the straits, from Manshiû to Hikushima. It was a splendid\r\nposition for guns, though a shell pitched in the line of the work would\r\nof necessity have fallen into it, unless passing very high, as it was\r\ncut out of the hillside. All about it there were places cleared for guns\r\nwhich would have a powerful effect against ships. The thick brushwood\r\nwould prevent any attempt at escalade, and a single gun is not easily\r\nhit. I do not know what might be done with modern artillery, but it was\r\nthe opinion of all our engineer officers that if the Japanese of that\r\nday had known the advantages of the position, they could easily have\r\nrendered it impregnable.\r\n\r\nAt two o'clock in the afternoon arrived the Chôshiû delegates, who by\r\nagreement made earlier in the day were to represent the prince. The\r\nstory they told us was that he had voluntarily shut himself up in order\r\nto await the will of the Mikado, or as they phrased it, he had placed\r\nhimself in an attitude of respectful attention (_tsutsushindé oru_).\r\nLest it should be supposed that this is merely a joke, I must explain\r\nthat in the old times, whenever a member of the _samurai_ class had\r\ncommitted an act in person or vicariously which might be expected to\r\nbring down upon him the wrath of his political superiors, he at once\r\nassumed a submissive posture, and as it were delivered himself up, tied\r\nhands and feet, to the pleasure of his lord. It was a sort of voluntary\r\nself-imprisonment as a first-class misdemeanant. We did not accept the\r\nexcuse, which it was natural to suppose had been invented to save him\r\nthe trouble of travelling to Shimonoséki, but I now incline to think\r\nthat horrorstruck at the violent proceedings of his followers who had\r\ndared to fight against the defenders of the palace (and also repenting\r\nof their failure), the old prince had hastened to atone for the crime of\r\ntreason, as far as lay in his power, by declaring his readiness to\r\nundergo any penalty that might be decreed by the sovereign--if his\r\nretainers would let him, being understood.\r\n\r\nTheir names were Shishido Bizen, Môri Idzumo, Shishido Giôma and Ibara\r\nKazuyé, ministers; and Nawozaki Yahichirô (_metsuké_, a secretary), Itô\r\nShunsuké, Hadano Kingo and another whose name I did not note down.\r\nBizen, it appeared, had after all not completely retired from public\r\naffairs. Both the Admirals were present. As soon as the conference was\r\nformed, Admiral Küper asked why they had not let him know earlier that\r\nthe prince was in seclusion, as the truce had been granted solely that\r\nthere might be time for him to reach Shimonoséki. They answered that the\r\nboat was slow, and they had only arrived late on the previous day. They\r\nhad spent a long time arguing with the prince and using their best\r\nefforts to persuade him to come, but he always answered that it was an\r\nold custom from which he could not depart. He was in disgrace with the\r\nMikado, and was not able to see even his own confidential retainers,\r\nmuch less could he see the Admirals. They regretted it very much, but it\r\ncould not be helped. The prince would have greatly liked to meet the\r\nAdmirals.\r\n\r\nAfter this question had been so thoroughly thrashed out that the\r\nJapanese could not but suppose that great importance was attached to a\r\ndirect undertaking on the part of the prince, the Admirals' demands were\r\nannounced, as follows:--\r\n\r\n_Firstly._ Foreign vessels passing through the straits to be treated in\r\na friendly manner; to be permitted to purchase coals, provisions, water\r\nand other necessaries. If driven in through stress of weather, the crews\r\nto be permitted to land.\r\n\r\n_Secondly._ Henceforth no new batteries to be constructed, the old ones\r\nnot to be repaired, and no guns to be mounted in them.\r\n\r\nThis article caused some discussion, for as now put it deprived them of\r\na loophole that had been left open on the previous occasion. But when\r\nthey were asked for what purpose the batteries had been erected, they\r\nhad but one answer--\"for making war on foreigners.\" \"Well then, those\r\nforeigners having destroyed the batteries, and taken the guns, will not\r\npermit any more to be put in the same place. The article is\r\nindispensable, and must stand as it is.\" So they agreed to it.\r\n\r\n_Thirdly._ The town of Shimonoséki might justly have been destroyed,\r\nbecause it fired on our ships. But it was left unhurt, and therefore a\r\nransom must be paid. Furthermore, the prince must defray the cost of the\r\nexpedition. The whole amount will be determined by the foreign\r\nrepresentatives at Yedo.\r\n\r\nTo this our friends offered strenuous opposition. Chôshiû and Bôshiû\r\nwere two very small provinces, and possessed a revenue of scarcely\r\n360,000 _koku_ of rice. Of this, 200,000 went to support the retainers,\r\nthe balance having been spent in batteries, guns, and all other manner\r\nof warlike equipments. If the sum demanded were beyond their resources,\r\nthey could not pay it. There were plenty of men in the province who\r\ncared nothing for their lives in comparison with the fulfilment of their\r\nduty towards the prince. It is he who wishes to make peace, and he has\r\nmuch difficulty in repressing their zeal. The Admiral replied that they\r\nshould have calculated the price beforehand. They had chosen to make\r\nwar, and now that the bill was being presented to them, they must pay\r\nit. Finally they agreed to this article, but it struck me that their\r\nobject was solely to let us know that their spirit was not entirely\r\nbroken, and that if our demands were too exorbitant they would fight\r\nrather than yield.\r\n\r\nLast of all we inserted in the draft a declaration that this was merely\r\na treaty for the temporary cessation of hostilities, and was entirely\r\nindependent of any questions connected with Chôshiû which might have to\r\nbe settled later on between the foreign representatives and the Japanese\r\nGovernment. I imagine that this clause had reference to the indemnities\r\nwhich might be demanded on the part of France, Holland and the United\r\nStates. At any rate, it was agreed to without any discussion. A fair\r\ncopy was written out, to which two of the _karôs_ affixed their\r\nsignatures, and a couple of days were given to them to go to Yamaguchi\r\nin order to obtain the prince's signature. Those who had not previously\r\nseen the ship were taken the usual round through the lower deck and\r\nengine room, and they left in a body.\r\n\r\nOn the 15th things seemed quiet enough for a little private exploration\r\non my own account in company with my teacher. We went first to call on\r\nIbara Kazuyé, one of the envoys who had negotiated the agreement of the\r\nday before, and asked him to come on board to be photographed by Beato.\r\nThen while Hayashi, whose crown was by this time black with a\r\nfortnight's bristly growth, went to a barber's shop to get himself clean\r\nshaved, I strolled about the streets alone, and turned into an\r\neating-house where we had agreed to meet. The people received me\r\ncivilly, and showed me upstairs to a room, one side of which was\r\nentirely open to the air, and overlooked a small courtyard. In the next\r\napartment were some Chôshiû two-sworded men leaning over the wooden\r\nbalcony, who waved their hands to me to go away, but I called out, \"What\r\ndo you want!\" in a fierce tone, and they collapsed immediately, so great\r\nwas the prestige of our victory. When Hayashi joined me, we ordered an\r\n_awabi_ to be got ready, and while it was being cooked, devoured nearly\r\nthe whole of a ripe water melon. The _awabi_ (rocksucker) was cooked\r\nwith sugar and proved terribly tough. Two sorts of _saké_ were served,\r\nand the waiting maid smoked all the while to perfume the room. We wound\r\nup with terrapin soup and rice. During the rest of my stay at\r\nShimonoséki, which lasted nearly a month, I was constantly on shore, and\r\nnever had any trouble with the townspeople, who were always civil and\r\nfriendly.\r\n\r\nThe treaty was brought down on the 16th, and found to be duly signed and\r\nsealed. At the same time the Japanese produced a paper which they wanted\r\nthe Admirals to sign, undertaking that the officers and crews should\r\nkeep within certain limits, and above all, should not land at night.\r\nThere was a good deal of misunderstanding about this document. The Abbé\r\nGirard's teacher maintained that it was a memorandum or note-verbale\r\nfrom the Chôshiû authorities, and as I was younger and had not the\r\nprestige of the Abbé as a Japanese scholar, I had to give way. So we\r\nconcocted a letter in reply, which I wrote out, and took on shore to the\r\ngovernor. Our letter said that the principal restrictions which the\r\nJapanese asked us to agree to had been granted already, and that as for\r\nthe rest, the governor had on the occasion of his last visit said there\r\nwere no complaints to make of our people trespassing on either\r\nguardhouses or temples, and therefore it was unnecessary for them to\r\nmake such demands. In future, if they had anything to communicate, it\r\nmust be done by letter, signed and sealed by Ibara Kazuyé. On reading\r\nthis, the governor to my delight said, \"Here's a mistake. What I brought\r\nto you was a draft of a letter for the naval commanders to write to us.\"\r\n\r\nThe object of the naval operations in the straits having been completely\r\nattained by the destruction of the batteries and the establishment of a\r\ngood understanding with the Prince of Chôshiû, preparations were now\r\nmade to withdraw the major portion of the allied squadrons, leaving only\r\nthree ships to prevent the possibility of the passage being again\r\nfortified. I received orders to remain behind on board the \"Barrosa.\" A\r\nday before the Admiral sailed a letter came from the governor asking him\r\nto give a passage as far as Yokohama to a _karô_ and two officers. The\r\nrequest was at once granted, but the three passengers not arriving in\r\ntime, word was left that they might apply to the French Admiral, who was\r\nto leave a day later. But this they declined to do, having been\r\ninstructed to ask for a passage in an English ship, and they would go by\r\nno other. Eventually the \"Barrosa\" took them.\r\n\r\nOn the 20th accordingly, all the British ships except the \"Barrosa,\" and\r\nall the Dutch ships but the \"Djambi,\" sailed away up the inland sea\r\ntowards Ozaka, the French, however, remaining. I went ashore afterwards\r\nwith some officers of the \"Barrosa\" for a walk, and as we passed the\r\nguardhouse, its occupants called out, \"Take off your hats.\" I replied,\r\n\"What do you say.\" The man on guard, \"Take off your hats. This is the\r\nhonourable guardhouse of Shimonoséki.\" Answer from our side, \"What folly\r\ndo you talk! If you repeat it, the governor shall be informed.\" So we\r\npassed on into the town to the governor's house and laid a complaint in\r\ndue form against the over-zealous guardhouse keeper. The governor\r\npromised to administer a reprimand, and was as good as his word, so that\r\nwhen some other officers came ashore and passed the same spot, the\r\nJapanese officers rushed out into the road to tell them that they need\r\nnot uncap.\r\n\r\nI found the townspeople very communicative about the exploits of the\r\nAmericans and French in 1863, and from their relation it was easy to see\r\nthat while Captain M'Dougall of the \"Wyoming\" had given a very modest\r\naccount of his achievements in the way of sinking ships and firing\r\nhouses, the French had greatly exaggerated their own deeds of valour.\r\nThe \"Wyoming\" ran the gauntlet of all the batteries and sank the\r\n\"Lancefield\" and the brig right in front of the town, whereas the\r\n\"Sémiramis\" never ventured further than Tanoura. The common folk were\r\nall entirely convinced that the Tycoon had given orders for the\r\nexpulsion of the foreigners, and I overheard a man in the market say\r\n\"the _Bakufu_ is playing a double game.\" _Bakufu_ was the most common\r\nterm by which the Tycoon's government was then designated. I was asked\r\nwhether the Tycoon had asked us to come down and destroy the batteries,\r\nto which I answered \"No; but he said he could not open the straits.\"\r\nThen I gave them our view of the case, which was that the Tycoon,\r\nfinding himself in a tight place between the _daimiôs_ and the\r\nforeigners, had to give assurances to both which were inconsistent with\r\neach other, whereupon they all cried out with one voice: \"_Homma da_, it\r\nis true.\" That evening there arrived from Nagasaki the steamer\r\n\"Victoria\" with the vice-governor of that port and an interpreter.\r\nPassing in front of the town they paid the French Admiral a call, and\r\nthen anchored near us in Tanoura Bay. Coming on board to make inquiries,\r\nthey asked whether Chôshiû had been beaten, and on our replying in the\r\naffirmative, they produced a copy of the prince's first letter begging\r\nfor peace addressed to the _Americans_, which they said had been\r\nfurnished to them by the Kokura people. That I told them bluntly must be\r\na lie, but they would not confess the source from which they had\r\nobtained the document. They said their instructions were to ask the\r\nAdmiral not to believe the lies Chôshiû was telling about orders\r\nreceived from the Tycoon to expel foreigners, and also that having heard\r\nthe fleet was going to Ozaka, the governor of Nagasaki, who was afraid\r\nthat the appearance of so large a force before the city, fresh from the\r\ndestruction of the batteries of Shimonoséki, might cause a panic, had\r\nsent them to prevent any difficulties between the Admiral and the\r\ngovernor of Ozaka. They were very anxious lest a treaty had been\r\nconcluded with Chôshiû for the opening of Shimonoséki to foreign trade,\r\nwhich would have caused the commercial ruin of Nagasaki; but we declined\r\nto give them any information. Having beaten the Chôshiû people, we had\r\ncome to like and respect them, while a feeling of dislike began to arise\r\nin our minds for the Tycoon's people on account of their weakness and\r\ndouble-dealing, and from this time onwards I sympathized more and more\r\nwith the _daimiô_ party, from whom the Tycoon's government had always\r\ntried to keep us apart.\r\n\r\nOn the 21st the \"Sémiramis\" and \"Dupleix\" quitted the straits, leaving\r\nbehind them the \"Tancrède.\" Some of us went ashore to the _honjin_ to\r\ninquire whether we could obtain a supply of bullocks for the ship. The\r\nofficials promised to do all they could, but said it would be difficult,\r\nas they killed none for themselves. We also asked them to change some\r\nMexican dollars into Japanese money, which they promised to do at the\r\nNagasaki market rate, but it was finally arranged that if we found\r\nourselves in actual need of coin, they should lend us a thousand\r\n_ichibus_, to be returned to their agent at Yokohama. They proved so\r\nobliging that we could not help regretting that in order to gain their\r\nfriendship it had been necessary to come to blows with them. And it is\r\nnot a little remarkable that neither the Satsuma nor the Chôshiû men\r\never seemed to cherish any resentment against us for what we had done,\r\nand during the years of disturbance and revolution that followed they\r\nwere always our most intimate allies.\r\n\r\nThat day we walked the whole length of the town unattended by any guard,\r\nand got a glimpse of the China sea beyond the straits. We met, however,\r\nwith a little show of insolence from a couple of two-sworded men, who\r\nmotioned us back to our boats, but I discoursed to them in their own\r\ntongue, and they were speedily reduced to silence: the exhibition of a\r\nrevolver had something to do with the production of this effect.\r\n\r\nItô came on board one day with a couple of men who, he said, were\r\nmerchants, but it was evident from the respect he paid to one of them,\r\nwho wore two swords, that they belonged to the high official class. They\r\nwere conducted round the ship and entertained with various liquors. He\r\ndeclared that in all the fighting they had only seven or eight men\r\nkilled, and about twice that number wounded, but one of his companions\r\ntold me that the number killed was nearly twenty. Itô said that trade\r\ncould be done at Shimonoséki in cotton, wax and silk produced in\r\nChôshiû, as well as in all the productions of the northern provinces and\r\nOzaka. Probably they might manufacture paper for the English market. The\r\nprince, he added, was very desirous of opening the port to foreign\r\ncommerce, but just at present they expected an invasion of the combined\r\nforces of the Tycoon and all the _daimiôs_, and all their attention was\r\ndirected to their own defence. The two vessels sunk by the \"Wyoming\" in\r\n1863 had been raised, and sent round to Hagi. I was surprised to learn\r\nthat the batteries at Maeda mura, as well as those at Kushi saki Point,\r\nwere within the territory of the _daimiô_ of Chôfu, who was however not\r\nin so far independent that he could stand aside when the head of the\r\nfamily went to war. Last year, at the time when the Dutch corvette\r\n\"Medusa\" was fired on as she passed the straits, batteries had existed\r\non the low hills behind the town, and at two points on the sea front,\r\nbut the guns had subsequently been removed thence to Dannoura and Maeda\r\nmura; their fate was to fall into our hands. The small three-gun battery\r\non Moji Point within the Kokura territory was also the work of the\r\nChôshiû men, who had levelled land and commenced the construction of\r\nbarracks, which were however destroyed by the Kokura people when the\r\nfailure of the prince's Kiôto schemes drove him to withdraw within his\r\nown boundaries for self-protection.\r\n\r\nWe went one day in our boats down to Kokura with the intention of\r\nlanding there to walk through the town, but after keeping us waiting an\r\nhour and a half, and repeatedly promising to open the gate, they finally\r\nrefused to admit us. They did indeed open it, but only to let out a\r\ncouple of fellows, who told us in the lowest of low voices that Kokura\r\nnot being a treaty port, we could not be allowed to enter. I took care\r\nto inform them of our opinion that it was a great piece of ingratitude\r\non their part to treat us in so inhospitable a manner after we had\r\nthrashed their enemy for them. Crowds of people had collected to look at\r\nus, and doubtless we should have been mobbed if we had landed. There was\r\nno idea on our part of forcing our way in.\r\n\r\nTowards the end of the month smallpox broke out on board, and W. H.\r\nCummings, who had succeeded to the temporary command on Captain Dowell's\r\ntransfer to the flagship, determined to leave for Yokohama as soon as\r\nthe necessary arrangements could be made. On the 27th we applied\r\ntherefore to the authorities for a pilot to take the ship through the\r\ninland sea, and gave notice that the commanders of the three ships would\r\npay a visit to Ibara on the morrow in order to settle about the passage\r\nup to Yokohama which had been promised to him and two other officers. I\r\ntook the message on shore, and stopped to have a meal with Itô, who\r\ngood-naturedly had made great efforts to get up a dinner in European\r\nstyle. He had built a table seven feet long by half that width, covered\r\nwith a short cloth of some coarse foreign material. Four plates were\r\nlaid, flanked by long knives, villainously sharp, attenuated brass\r\nspoons with flat bowls, and a pair of chopsticks. The first dish\r\nconsisted of a boiled rockfish, which I found great difficulty in\r\ncutting, but accomplished the task at last by inserting a sharpened\r\nchopstick into the head, and using a spoon to remove the flesh. Soy, a\r\nlarge bowl of rice, and a small saucer full of coarse salt, were also\r\nplaced on the table. The second course was broiled eels, and then came\r\na stewed terrapin, both of which were very good, but the boiled _awabi_\r\nand boiled chicken which followed were quite out of the question. It was\r\na problem how to cut up a fowl with a knife that had no point, and whose\r\nblade threatened at every moment to part company with its handle. I\r\nabandoned the attempt, and served my companions with slices from the\r\nbreast. Unripe persimmons, peeled and cut in four, with sweet rice beer\r\n(_mirin_) were now produced, and this was excellent. This was certainly\r\nthe earliest attempt ever made in that part of Japan at giving a dinner\r\nin European style, perhaps the first in Japan.\r\n\r\nIt was finally determined that the party that was to visit Yokohama\r\nshould consist of Ibara, a councillor named Sugi Tokusuké, a secretary,\r\nand Itô, with four servants, who were to be accommodated on board the\r\n\"Barrosa\" and \"Djambi.\" The \"Tancrède,\" which was to leave before us,\r\ncould not find room for more than half the party, and as they did not\r\nwish to be separated longer than they could help, they elected to come\r\nwith us. On the 4th October the \"Racehorse,\" Commander Boxer, arrived to\r\nrelieve us. Ibara and his secretary, Yamagata Keizô, and we sailed the\r\nfollowing morning.\r\n\r\nNews of our successful result of the naval operations and of the\r\nconclusion of a convention with the Prince of Chôshiû was at once\r\nconveyed to the foreign representatives at Yokohama, who lost no time in\r\ncalling the Tycoon's government to account for their apparent complicity\r\nwith Chôshiû, as evidenced by the copies of orders from Kiôto which Itô\r\nhad given us. The explanation was feeble, and the representatives found\r\nno difficulty in obtaining from the ministers their consent to pay\r\nwhatever war indemnity might be due from Chôshiû, or else to throw open\r\nto trade a port in the inland sea. Although in the sequel the receipt of\r\nthe indemnity money by us actually took place, it was in a manner forced\r\nupon the four Powers and their diplomatic agents, and certainly as far\r\nas Sir R. Alcock is concerned, he may be entirely exonerated from the\r\naccusation of a desire to exact an indemnity from either the defeated\r\n_daimiô_ or the government which assumed responsibility for him. The\r\nprincipal object he sought was to obtain the sanction of the Mikado to\r\nthe treaties, so as to put an end to the agitation against foreign\r\ncommerce which had been carried on by hostile _daimiôs_ in the Mikado's\r\nname ever since the opening of the ports. Now that Satsuma and Chôshiû,\r\nthe two ringleaders of the opposition, had been brought to their senses,\r\nit ought to have been, he thought, an easy matter for the Tycoon's\r\ngovernment, if they sincerely desired to carry out their treaty\r\nobligations, to assert their authority and compel the whole country to\r\naccept the new policy of foreign intercourse. The fixing of an indemnity\r\nwas intended only to provide a means of pressure upon the Tycoon's\r\ngovernment in order to procure the Mikado's ratification of the\r\ntreaties, and the consequent extension of commercial relations.\r\n\r\nIbara and his companions reached Yokohama on the 10th October, and\r\nobtained an interview the same day with Sir Rutherford Alcock and Mr.\r\nPruyn, the United States minister. The reception accorded to them was of\r\nsuch a nature as to convince them that the foreign powers were not\r\nhostilely disposed towards the _daimiô_ of Chôshiû, and it was no doubt\r\nwith a sense of relief that they learnt the intention of the foreign\r\nrepresentatives to claim the payment of the indemnity from the Tycoon.\r\nAt the same time it was clearly understood by both parties that the\r\nother engagements entered into by Chôshiû respecting the permanent\r\ndisarmament of the straits of Shimonoséki and the hospitable treatment\r\nof foreign vessels were to be faithfully adhered to, and on these heads\r\nhis subsequent conduct gave no ground for complaint. It was somewhat a\r\ncurious position for the retainers of a prince, who had been declared a\r\nrebel against the Mikado and enemy of the Tycoon, to land at Yokohama, a\r\nport belonging to the latter, but as far as I remember, they confined\r\ntheir visit to the foreign settlement, where they were safe from\r\ninterference, and on the 14th the \"Tartar\" left with them on board to\r\nreturn to their native province.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XII\r\n\r\n                     THE MURDER OF BIRD AND BALDWIN\r\n\r\n\r\nIT was about this time that Sir Rutherford Alcock received Lord\r\nRussell's despatches recalling him to England. Ostensibly for the\r\npurpose of consulting with him on the situation of affairs, this summons\r\nto London was accompanied by the expression of an opinion that the\r\npassage of the inland sea was not necessary to foreign commerce, which\r\namounted to a censure upon his conduct. It is seldom that an agent of\r\nthe Foreign Office is told in so many words that he is recalled because\r\nhis conduct of affairs has not given satisfaction, but inasmuch as leave\r\nof absence is usually granted upon the application of the ambassador,\r\nenvoy, or whatever the title of the head of a mission may be, an\r\ninvitation to return home is equivalent to the removal of a diplomatic\r\nofficer from his employment. But arriving just at the moment when his\r\npolicy had been successful in every direction, and when all the\r\nforeigners in the country were united in a chorus of gratitude to him\r\nfor his energetic action, he and all the members of his legation felt\r\nthat the displeasure of Lord John Russell was not a matter of much\r\nmoment. The crushing defeat of Chôshiû by the foreign squadrons coming\r\nso immediately after the repulse of his troops from the gates of the\r\npalace at Kiôto restored confidence to the Tycoon's government, and\r\nenabled them to declare firmly to the Mikado that the idea of expelling\r\nforeigners from the country and putting an end to trade was utterly and\r\nentirely impracticable, while on the other hand the demonstrated\r\nsuperiority of European methods of warfare had converted our bitterest\r\nand most determined foes into fast friends. The vindication of his\r\nproceedings was no difficult task, and the despatch in which he\r\njustified the course he had taken was conceived in a style at once calm\r\nand convincing. It is only fair to Lord Russell to say that he lost no\r\ntime in acknowledging that his agent had been in the right, and in\r\nconveying to him the Queen's full approbation of his conduct. But this\r\nsolatium to his feelings did not reach Yokohama until he was already on\r\nhis way to England.\r\n\r\nThe Shôgun's government voluntarily undertook to be responsible for\r\nwhatever sum might be fixed upon as the indemnity to be paid by the\r\nPrince of Chôshiû. On the 22nd October a convention was signed by a\r\nmember of the Shôgun's second council and the four foreign\r\nrepresentatives by which three millions of dollars were to be paid in\r\nsatisfaction of all claims, or as an alternative the opening of\r\nShimonoséki or some other port in the inland sea, if the Tycoon\r\npreferred to offer it and the Powers were willing to accept. The\r\ndivision of this sum of money among the different Powers was reserved\r\nfor adjustment between the four governments. Advantage was also taken of\r\nthe desire to conciliate foreign Powers now manifested by the Tycoon's\r\nministers to obtain the promise of various improvements at Yokohama\r\ncalculated to add to the comfort and well-being of the foreign\r\nresidents, and Sir Rutherford, having thus reaped all the fruits of his\r\ncourage and perseverance was preparing to quit Japan in obedience to the\r\ninstructions of Lord Russell, when a fresh and totally unforeseen event\r\noccurred which for a time delayed his departure.\r\n\r\nAfter our successes at Shimonoséki, and the frank admission by the\r\nTycoon's government of the necessity of maintaining the treaties, the\r\nconfidence of foreign residents in the safety of the neighbourhood had\r\nso completely revived that they no longer feared to make excursions\r\nwithin the limits marked out by the treaties. But they received a rude\r\nshock on the night of the 20th November when the governor of Kanagawa\r\ncame to Mr. Winchester, the British Consul, and informed him that Major\r\nBaldwin and Lieutenant Bird of the xxth regiment had been barbarously\r\nmurdered at Kamakura, a well-known resort some twelve miles from\r\nYokohama. Baldwin was killed on the spot, but according to the testimony\r\nof the inhabitants, Bird had lived for some hours after he was disabled.\r\nThe two officers had visited the famous colossal Buddha, and riding\r\nalong the road towards the temple of Hachiman, were just about to turn\r\nthe corner into the avenue when a couple of men sprang out upon them\r\nwith their keen-edged swords and inflicted such ghastly wounds as\r\nbrought them to the ground almost unresistingly. The horror of the\r\nforeign community can be more easily imagined than described, and it was\r\nfurther deepened when as the result of the inquest it came to be\r\nsuspected that the mortal wound to which Bird had succumbed had been\r\ninflicted some hours after the assassins had left the spot. This, in the\r\nopinion of the surgeons, was a wound in the neck completely dividing the\r\nspinal cord between the second and third cervical vertebrae, which\r\nclearly must have been followed by instant death. Now all the evidence\r\nwent to show that the younger victim had lived until ten o'clock in the\r\nevening. If so, by whom was this wound given, and with what motive?\r\nThose who implicitly relied upon the report of the regimental surgeons\r\njumped to the conclusion that it was the act of one of the officials\r\ndespatched to the scene of the murder by the governor as soon as the\r\nnews was brought to him, which was no doubt some three or four hours\r\nbefore he himself went to communicate it to Mr. Winchester, and the\r\nmotive was suggested to be a desire to prevent the wounded man from\r\ngiving such information to his countrymen as might have led to the\r\nidentification of the murderers. But I cannot believe that any Japanese,\r\nofficial or not, could ever have compassed such a treacherous deed. I\r\nbelieve on the contrary that the surgeons who dissected out the wound,\r\nnot using sufficient care, themselves divided the spinal cord with a\r\nprobe or some other instrument, and that Bird's death was caused in\r\nreality by the loss of blood from his numerous wounds. And this was the\r\nview taken by Dr Willis of our legation and Dr Jenkins, then established\r\nas a general practitioner in Yokohama, neither of whom was invited to\r\nassist at the _post mortem_.\r\n\r\nThe two surgeons having made a hurried examination and enunciated\r\ncertain views as to the nature of Bird's wounds, without foreseeing the\r\ninferences that might be drawn, would naturally, and probably with\r\nentire good faith, adhere to those views afterwards, especially as it\r\nwould not appear to them at all incredible _à priori_ that the\r\ncountrymen of the men who had committed such a foul assassination should\r\nbe capable of a deed, dastardly enough in itself, but no doubt\r\njustifiable in the opinion of any foreigner-hating Japanese official.\r\nThere are many additional considerations suggested by the reports\r\ncontained in the Parliamentary papers which would corroborate the view\r\nhere put forth, if I had space to discuss them. But as this book is\r\nintended to be a record of my own experiences and memories, and not a\r\ncompilation from published materials, it is not the place to go into all\r\nthese particulars at length.\r\n\r\nThe Tycoon's government made all the exertions in their power to trace\r\nthe assassins, and before a month was over they had arrested one of the\r\nguilty persons, named Shimidzu Seiji. Already on the 16th two of his\r\nassociates named Gamaiké and Inaba, accused of combining with him in a\r\nplot to murder foreigners, and of extorting money from a rich farmer,\r\nhad been executed, though they were not actual accomplices in the\r\nKamakura crime.\r\n\r\nI was present at the execution of these two men, which took place in an\r\nenclosure outside the Japanese gaol in the afternoon of the 16th\r\nDecember 1864. There was a large concourse of spectators, both foreign\r\nand native. A little after three o'clock a whisper ran round that the\r\ncondemned were being brought out. A door opened, and a man blindfolded\r\nand bound with cords was led through the crowd. He was made to kneel\r\ndown on a rough mat placed in front of a hole dug in the ground to\r\nreceive his blood. The attendants drew his clothes downwards so as to\r\nlay the neck bare, and with the hand brushed his hair upwards, so as to\r\ngive full play to the sword. The executioner secured a piece of cotton\r\ncloth round the handle of his weapon, and having carefully whetted the\r\nblade, took up a position to the left of his victim, then raising the\r\nsword high above his head with both hands, let it fall with a swoop that\r\nsevered the neck completely. The head was held up for the inspection of\r\nthe chief officer present, who simply remarked: \"I have seen it,\" and it\r\nwas thrown into the hole. The second man being then carried in, the\r\nattendants seemed to have a little trouble in getting him to kneel in\r\nthe proper position, but at last the arrangements were completed to\r\ntheir satisfaction. The neck having been bared as before, a fresh\r\nexecutioner advanced, took his place at the prisoner's left side, and\r\nraising the sword with a flourish, let it descend with the same skill as\r\nhis predecessor. It was a horrible sight to see the attendants holding\r\nthe headless corpse down to the hole, and kneading it so as to make the\r\nblood flow more readily into the hole, and I left the spot in all haste,\r\nvowing that mere curiosity should never induce me to witness another\r\nexecution.\r\n\r\nCapital punishment was much commoner in Japan in those days than it has\r\nbeen since the promulgation of the present humane penal code, and\r\nincluded transfixing with spears. Many of the foreign residents must\r\nhave been present at such sanguinary spectacles, merely impelled by\r\ncuriosity, and without the natural excuse of desiring to see the\r\nsentence of the law fulfilled upon an offender against their own blood.\r\n\r\nThe night before Sir Rutherford embarked for England news was brought to\r\nhim of the arrest of Shimidzu Seiji, one of the actual murderers of\r\nBaldwin and Bird. Owing to the reputed excellence of the native\r\ndetective police, which under a despotic government is usually\r\nefficient, it was believed by us that the Japanese Government could\r\nalways have procured the arrest of the assailants of foreigners, if they\r\nhad been determined to do so. The names, _e.g._, of many of those who\r\nwere engaged in the attack on our legation in 1861 were, as I learnt\r\nsome years afterwards, matter of common notoriety, but in the difficult\r\npolitical position that the Tycoon's advisers had created for\r\nthemselves, they did not dare to convict the murderer of a foreigner.\r\nThis then was the first instance of such a crime being brought home to\r\nits perpetrators. The British minister had good reason to feel gratified\r\nat this proof that his policy had been the right one, and it was a very\r\nnatural movement that induced him to take off his watch and chain and\r\nthrow them over the neck of the messenger of good tidings.\r\n\r\nShimidzu Seiji was executed on the 28th December at ten o'clock in the\r\nmorning, in the presence of a detachment of the English garrison.\r\nWhatever doubts may have existed as to the complicity of Gamaiké and\r\nInaba in his designs against the lives of the foreign residents, there\r\nis none as to the fact that this man was one of the actual murderers of\r\nBaldwin and Bird. I was instructed to accompany Mr. M. O. Flowers, the\r\nacting consul, to the prison on the preceding day to hear the sentence\r\npronounced. We waited some hours till he arrived from Yedo in custody of\r\na strong guard, and he was at once confronted with the witnesses, who\r\nexamined his features in silence. They were then separately\r\ninterrogated, and one and all recognized him, the most important witness\r\nbeing the boy who had seen the attack. Afterwards we proceeded to\r\nanother room and questioned the prisoner, who acknowledged his guilt in\r\nthe clearest manner possible. He was proceeding to say something more,\r\nbut was ordered by the Japanese officers to be silent. But the best\r\nevidence of his identity was obtained by another member of the consular\r\nservice, who after the murderer had been paraded round the town preceded\r\nby a banner on which his sentence was inscribed (this was part of his\r\npunishment), accompanied the procession back to the execution ground.\r\nHere Mr. Fletcher overheard him say: \"When I killed the foreigners, I\r\nexpected one of them might be a consul,\" and every one who knew our\r\ncolleague will acknowledge that he was a man of the most exact\r\ntruthfulness, who was not in the least degree likely to make a mistake\r\nin such a matter, or over anxious to believe that the Japanese\r\nGovernment were in this instance departing from the bad faith which is\r\nthe usual refuge of Asiatics in a difficult position.\r\n\r\nOn the morning of the 28th the garrison was marched over to the\r\nexecution ground, and drawn up on one side. The prisoner was brought out\r\nabout ten o'clock. The first words he uttered were a request for some\r\n_saké_. Being again questioned, he frankly acknowledged his guilt. I\r\nasked him what it was that he had been prevented from saying to us on\r\nthe previous day, to which he answered that if Bird and Baldwin had got\r\nout of his way he would not have attacked them. Whether this was true or\r\nnot I have no means of judging, but it does not accord with his written\r\ndeposition. That, it must be recollected, is not in Japan a simple\r\nrecord of everything a prisoner says, but is a reduction in writing by\r\nan officer of the court of the final result of all the statements made\r\nby him on the different occasions when he was examined, and resembles\r\nmuch more the summing up of the evidence on a criminal trial in England\r\nby the presiding judge. He begged the Japanese officials not to bandage\r\nhis eyes, and began to chant a verse which might be thus translated:\r\n\r\n    \"I do not regret being taken and put to death,\r\n    For to kill barbarians is the true spirit of a Japanese.\"\r\n\r\nAs the attendants were drawing back the clothes from his neck to prepare\r\nit for the executioner's stroke, he bade them loosen his cords so that\r\nthey might do it with greater ease, adding: \"In after ages they will\r\nsay, what a fine fellow was Shimidzu Seiji.\" He also remarked, \"I don't\r\nthink the sword that cut off Gempachi's head will do for me,\" alluding\r\nprobably to the thickness of his own neck, and begged that the blade\r\nmight be well whetted. Then saying, \"Cut neatly if you please,\" he\r\nstretched out his neck for the stroke. These were the last words he\r\nspoke, but just as the sword began to descend he turned his head to the\r\nleft as if to address some further observation to the officials, so that\r\nthe cut partly missed its purpose, and the executioner had to hack the\r\nhead off--a most horrible sight. Simultaneously with the delivery of the\r\nfirst blow, a gun fired by the battery of Royal Artillery announced to\r\nall that the assassin had received the punishment of his crime, and we\r\ndispersed as quickly as possible. The head was taken to the bridge at\r\nthe northern entrance of Yokohama and there exposed on a gibbet for\r\nthree days. Copies of the sentence were posted up at Totsuka and at the\r\nscene of the murder, and a few days later I accompanied the Legation\r\nmounted guard to see that this part of the undertaking given by the\r\nJapanese authorities had been duly performed. We found that they had\r\nfulfilled their promises to the letter, and thus ended one of the most\r\ndramatic incidents in the whole of my experience in the country.\r\n\r\nIt was impossible not to hate the assassin, but nevertheless, looking at\r\nthe matter from a Japanese point of view, I confess that I could not\r\nhelp regretting that a man who was evidently of such heroic mould,\r\nshould have been misguided enough to believe that his country could be\r\nhelped by such means. But the blood of the foreigners who fell under the\r\nswords of Japanese murderers, and the lives which were sacrificed to\r\navenge it bore fruit in later days, and fertilised the ground from which\r\nsprang the tree of the national regeneration.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\n               RATIFICATION OF THE TREATIES BY THE MIKADO\r\n\r\n\r\nSIR RUTHERFORD having quitted Japan, the conduct of affairs was assumed\r\nby Mr. Winchester as Chargé d'Affaires. Before long despatches reached\r\nus from Lord Russell expressing the entire satisfaction of the British\r\nGovernment with the policy pursued by our late chief, and we heard that\r\nhe had been rewarded by promotion to the more important post of minister\r\nat Peking. He was succeeded by Sir Harry Parkes, who came to us invested\r\nwith the prestige of a man who had looked death in the face with no\r\nordinary heroism, and in the eyes of all European residents in the far\r\neast held a higher position than any officer of the crown in those\r\ncountries. And whatever may have been his faults and shortcomings,\r\nespecially towards the latter part of his career, it must be\r\nacknowledged that England never was represented by a more devoted public\r\nservant, and that Japan herself owes to his exertions a debt which she\r\ncan never repay and has never fully acknowledged. If he had taken a\r\ndifferent side in the revolution of 1868, if he had simply acted with\r\nthe majority of his colleagues, almost insurmountable difficulties would\r\nhave been placed in the way of the Mikado's restoration, and the civil\r\nwar could never have been brought to so speedy a termination. He was an\r\nindefatigable worker, entirely absorbed in the duties of his post,\r\nuntiring in his endeavours to obtain a correct view of his surroundings,\r\nnever sparing himself, and requiring from his subordinates the same\r\nzealous assiduity. Of his personal courage I had the opportunity\r\nafterwards of witnessing one striking example, and brilliant as have\r\nbeen the achievements of many of our Indian civilians, I do not think\r\nthat his coolness and fortitude in the moment of peril have ever been\r\nsurpassed by any man not bred to war. He was strict and severe in\r\nservice matters, but in his private relations gracious to all those who\r\nhad occasion to seek his help, and a faithful friend to all who won his\r\ngoodwill. Unfortunately I was not one of these, and the result was that\r\nfrom the beginning we were never friends, down to the very last, though\r\nhe never had reason to complain of sloth or unreadiness to take my share\r\nof the work, and so it came about that before long I became one of his\r\nassistants, and in the end of 1866 was finally transferred from the\r\nYokohama Consulate (where I had been appointed interpreter early in\r\n1865) to the Legation.\r\n\r\nThe accomplice of Shimidzu Seiji in the murder of Bird and Baldwin,\r\nnamed Mamiya Hajimé, was executed on the 30th October 1865. I went out\r\nearly with Flowers in pouring rain to question the prisoner on some\r\npoints which had to be cleared up in connection with the crime. He was\r\ncondemned to the same punishment as his confederate, and we went out\r\nagain at one o'clock to be present at his decapitation. It was a pouring\r\nwet day, and the dull leaden sky overhead was in keeping with the\r\nmelancholy occasion. Mamiya was a young fellow, and endowed with far\r\nless fortitude than Shimidzu, and in order to enable him to face the\r\nexecutioner he had been allowed to stupify himself with drink. His head\r\nwas taken off at a single blow. The usual doubts as to his identity were\r\nexpressed by the local foreign press, but for myself I was convinced\r\nthat he was one of the assassins. If the Tycoon's government had\r\nsubstituted any other criminal for a man whom they had not succeeded in\r\ncapturing, the truth would have surely leaked out, and by this time we\r\nhad sources of information which would have enabled us speedily to\r\ndetect any trick.\r\n\r\nSir Harry Parkes reached Yokohama early in July, and Mr. Winchester took\r\nhis departure for Shanghai, where he had been appointed to be consul. F.\r\nS. Myburgh was transferred at the same time from Nagasaki to the\r\nYokohama consulate. In passing through Nagasaki Sir Harry had already\r\nlearnt from the agents of some of the _daimiôs_ that a civil war was\r\nexpected at no distant date, the object of which would be the overthrow\r\nof the Tycoon. He already in September began to speak to the Tycoon's\r\ncouncil of the desirability of obtaining the Mikado's ratification of\r\nthe treaties, but the credit of the idea is in reality due to Mr.\r\nWinchester, who (I did not know it at the time) as early as April had\r\nsuggested to the British Government that the written adhesion of the\r\nMikado to the treaties, and the reduction of the import duties to a\r\nuniform tariff of 5 per cent. _ad valorem_ might be obtained in return\r\nfor the partial abandonment of the Shimonoséki indemnity, the Tycoon's\r\nministers having stated they could not continue to make the quarterly\r\npayments of $500,000 at a time, as had been stipulated in the\r\nconvention. In fact Sir Rutherford Alcock had begun to lay stress on the\r\nnecessity of the Mikado's ratification of the treaties almost\r\nimmediately after the bombardment of Shimonoséki. This suggestion was\r\napproved by Lord Russell, who at once communicated it to the governments\r\nof Holland, France, and the United States, and sent despatches to Japan\r\nto the same effect which reached Sir Harry Parkes towards the end of\r\nOctober. He lost no time in consulting with his colleagues, and in\r\nproposing that they should proceed in a body to Ozaka, supported by a\r\nconsiderable squadron of men-of-war, to negotiate direct with the main\r\nbody of the Tycoon's ministers. I should have mentioned before that the\r\nTycoon was at Kiôto, having proceeded thither in the month of June,\r\nostensibly for the purpose of taking command of the army which was to\r\nchastise the presumptuous rebel, the Prince of Chôshiû, and was still\r\ndetained there by various intrigues and the insufficiency of his\r\nmilitary means.\r\n\r\nThe French minister, who was at first strongly opposed to the\r\nabandonment of the indemnity in exchange for the opening of a port, had\r\nreceived instructions from his government which had induced him to come\r\nover to the views of the British representative, who found the United\r\nStates Chargé d'Affaires and Netherlands Political Agent equally willing\r\nto follow his lead. As to the latter, we were accustomed to believe that\r\nSir Harry had him \"in his pocket,\" as the phrase goes, and the Americans\r\nhad at that time partially abandoned the affectation of acting on\r\ndifferent lines from the \"effete monarchies of Europe.\" Unity of action\r\nbeing thus secured, the word was passed to the naval commanders to get\r\nready for sea, and the legations having packed up a sufficient quantity\r\nof foolscap paper, silk tape, quill pens and bottles of ink, embarked on\r\nboard the next day but one after the signature of a protocol in which\r\nthe four diplomatic representatives had recorded their views and\r\nprojects. Sir Harry took with him John Macdonald, Alexander von Siebold\r\nand myself.\r\n\r\nThe squadron was an imposing one, though not so overwhelmingly strong as\r\nthat which had destroyed the batteries at Shimonoséki in the previous\r\nyear. Of British ships there were the \"Princess Royal,\" 73, flying the\r\nbroad pennant of Admiral St George Vincent King; the \"Leopard,\" 18;\r\n\"Pelorus,\" 22; and \"Bouncer,\" 1; of French, the \"Guerrière,\" 36;\r\n\"Dupleix,\" 12; and \"Kienchang,\" 4; while the Netherlands contributed the\r\ncorvette \"Zoutman.\" Our Admiral was extremely good-natured, and had\r\nfitted up private cabins for us three civilians on the main deck. I was\r\ndelighted to find myself on board with my friend A. G. S. Hawes, a\r\nmarine officer recently transferred to the flagship from the \"Severn.\"\r\n\r\nThe foreign representatives, it was rumoured, proposed, in addition to\r\nthe Mikado's ratification of the treaties and the reduction of the\r\ntariff, to ask for the opening of Ozaka and Hiôgo to foreign trade on\r\nthe 1st January 1866. By the Treaty of 1858 these places were to have\r\nbeen opened on the 1st January 1863, but the powers had in 1862 agreed\r\nto a postponement of five years, in order to give time for things to\r\nsettle down. In return, the four powers were ready to forgo two-thirds\r\nof the Shimonoséki indemnity, and the option of deciding was to be left\r\nto the Tycoon. This much was bruited about among the members of the\r\nforeign legations. Outsiders said that we were about to present an\r\n_ultimatum_, and that the creation of two new centres of foreign trade\r\nwas to be demanded without alternative. The men in the service who\r\nexpected appointments would of course have been eager to believe this\r\nversion but for the glorious uncertainty which surrounds all diplomatic\r\nprojects.\r\n\r\nThe Yedo government were alarmed at the energetic step on which the\r\nrepresentatives had resolved, and Midzuno Idzumi no Kami, the only\r\nmember of the first council who had remained behind in Yedo when the\r\nTycoon went up to Kiôto, came down in the company of Sakai Hida no Kami,\r\none of the second council, to exert all his powers of dissuasion with\r\nSir Harry. It was the first time that a functionary of so high a rank\r\nhad ever visited a foreign legation, and the evidence of anxiety thus\r\nafforded simply confirmed the resolution that had been taken to bring\r\nmatters to a crisis. That Midzuno and his subordinate hoped their\r\nefforts would be successful there is no reason to suppose, and in fact\r\nthey contented themselves mainly with offering some advice as to the\r\nbest method of proceeding on the arrival of the representatives at\r\nHiôgo.\r\n\r\nWe left on the 1st November, and proceeding in a leisurely manner along\r\nthe coast, passed the Idzumi Straits at 8 a.m. on the 4th. The guns were\r\nloaded and the men beat to quarters, but the garrison of the forts at\r\nYura showed no signs of molesting us, and everybody soon quieted down\r\nagain. At half-past eleven we came in sight of Ozaka, lying on the low\r\nland at the mouth of the Yodo river. The mountains which enclose the bay\r\non either side here appear to retire far into the interior, until they\r\ndisappear in the haze. The Tycoon's castle was easily distinguished by\r\nits innumerable many-storied white towers, rising at the back of the\r\ncity. But of the town very little was visible owing to the slight\r\nelevation of the houses and the distance from the deep water outside\r\nwhere we were passing. The allied squadron formed in one line, headed by\r\nthe \"Princess Royal,\" and gradually rounded off in the direction of\r\nHiôgo, where we anchored at half-past one. One by one the other ships\r\ncame in and took up the positions indicated to them.\r\n\r\nThe bay was crowded with junks of all sizes, and we counted seven\r\nJapanese steamers lying at anchor. From one of these, belonging to the\r\nTycoon's War Department, a couple of officers came on board to make the\r\nusual inquiries, and shortly afterwards some very inquisitive\r\nshore-going officials came off, who put a great many questions about the\r\nobject of our visit and where we had come from. They got very little\r\ninformation in reply, but were told that some officers would be going by\r\nsea to Ozaka on the following day, and that notice should be sent to the\r\ngovernor of the city in order that he might despatch somebody down to\r\nthe landing-place to meet them. They were also requested to provide\r\npilots for the two vessels to be despatched to Ozaka, but they declared\r\nthemselves unable to promise anything we asked. However, as by their own\r\nrules they were under an obligation to send information to the governor,\r\nthis refusal was not of any great consequence.\r\n\r\nThe Abbé Girard, who had acted as interpreter to Admiral Jaurès the\r\nprevious year at Shimonoséki, was on this occasion replaced by M. Mermet\r\nde Cachon, a Jesuit attached to the French legation. He, with Messrs\r\nMacdonald and von Siebold of our legation, and Mr. Hegt, the clerk of\r\nthe Netherlands Political Agent, were despatched on the following day in\r\nthe \"Kienchang\" to Ozaka bearing letters from the foreign\r\nrepresentatives. The \"Bouncer\" was to have taken our people, but her\r\ncommander was not able to get up steam in time, so that the French flag\r\nalone made its appearance at the bar of Ozaka. First point scored by the\r\nFrench. M. Mermet had ingeniously prepared the French's minister's\r\nletter in Japanese, inserting at the end a long paragraph, which did not\r\nappear in the other three letters, empowering himself to state in\r\noutline to the Tycoon's council the objects of the foreign\r\nrepresentatives, hoping thus to become the spokesman for all four.\r\n\r\nOn arriving at the mouth of the river, they were met by the two\r\ngovernors of the city (all officials were kept in duplicate in those\r\ndays), who conducted them to a building close at hand, evidently\r\nprepared beforehand for their reception. On learning that M. Mermet and\r\nhis companions desired to have a personal interview with one of the\r\ncouncil, the governors started off immediately to fetch him, as they\r\nsaid, promising that he should be down by four o'clock. In the meantime\r\nMacdonald, Siebold and Hegt started off to walk to Ozaka, intending to\r\nseek out the ministers there, but after wandering a long distance, they\r\nfound themselves at three o'clock only just in sight of the city, and\r\nhad to hurry back in a boat. The governors, however, did more than keep\r\ntheir promise, and instead of one, produced two of the council, namely\r\nOgasawara Iki no Kami and Abé Bungo no Kami. The letters were delivered\r\nto them, and they listened civilly and even affably to the messages\r\nwhich Mermet and Macdonald delivered, but were unprepared of course to\r\ngive any answer. It was agreed, however, that Abé should proceed to\r\nHiôgo on the 9th to meet the four representatives on board the \"Princess\r\nRoyal,\" as sole negotiator on behalf of the Tycoon, who, it was stated,\r\nhad gone up to Kiôto. For me had been reserved the less glorious task of\r\nopening up communications with the local officials, and in company with\r\nCaptain W. G. Jones I went ashore to talk about beef, water, coals, and\r\nother ship's requirements. We also informed them that the officers would\r\nland, and requested that the townspeople might be ordered to treat them\r\nwith civility. This they promised to do, but added that their duty to\r\ntheir chiefs, the governors of Ozaka, would oblige them to detail one or\r\ntwo constables to watch over the safety of each party. After we had\r\nconversed awhile with the head constable, a young man of 19 or 20, some\r\nhigher officials made their appearance and assumed the power. They\r\npromised to do everything we asked, and to help their memories made very\r\nfull notes. In the afternoon accordingly, leave to go ashore was given\r\nto all the ships, and many of the officers availed themselves of the\r\nopportunity of visiting what was then a _terra incognita_ to most\r\nEuropeans. The Admiral, Sir Harry and myself walked from one end of the\r\ntown to the other, and found the inhabitants well-disposed, though they\r\nfollowed us in crowds.\r\n\r\nThis was a very different reception from what the Tycoon's officers had\r\nwarned us to expect. They always talked to us of the hostility of the\r\n_daimiôs_ and the dislike and fear of us entertained by the common\r\npeople, but we met with nothing but indications of goodwill from all\r\nclasses. It became clearer to us every day that the Shôgunate feared\r\nlest free communication between foreigners and those sections of the\r\nJapanese people who were outside its direct control would impair the\r\nauthority of the institutions that had now lasted, with no small benefit\r\nto the Tokugawa family, for the last 260 years, and that consequently it\r\ncould not be a desirable policy for Great Britain to endeavour to\r\nbolster up a decaying power. As an instance of the manner in which the\r\nTycoon's officials endeavoured to obstruct intercourse, it may be\r\nmentioned that they published a notification in Ozaka forbidding the\r\ntownspeople to visit the ships, knowing full well that a closer\r\nacquaintance would make their subjects and foreigners better friends.\r\n\r\nThe next few days were spent in exploring the neighbourhood with a view\r\nto selecting a site for a foreign settlement, and there was a good deal\r\nof running up and down to Ozaka by sea with messages for the council.\r\nAbé was not able to come on Thursday, and at first it was held out that\r\nanother member of the council would replace him, but when the day\r\narrived, the two governors of Ozaka made their appearance with other\r\nexcuses. Sir Harry spoke very strongly to them, and insisted on seeing\r\nsome one on Saturday at the latest. But as he did not expect that his\r\nrequest would be complied with, he despatched Siebold, Hegt and myself\r\nearly in the morning to Ozaka. On approaching the anchorage, however, we\r\nsaw a Japanese steamer coming from the opposite direction, and lowering\r\na boat we went on board. We found that she was conveying Abé Bungo no\r\nKami to Hiôgo to see the foreign ministers. It was arranged therefore\r\nthat Siebold should return with him, while Hegt and I went on with a\r\ncouple of officials lent to us by Abé. But as soon as we anchored these\r\nmen began to be obstructive, refusing to accompany us on shore until the\r\nport officers had first visited the ship. Seeing, however, that we were\r\ndetermined to go, without them if necessary, they at last stepped over\r\nthe side into the boat with a very bad grace indeed. We rowed in safely\r\nin the ship's gig, with four bluejackets well-armed, over the bar, which\r\na few days before had been rendered impassable by a strong west wind,\r\nand landed in a small creek behind the battery at Tempôzan Point. We at\r\nonce took possession of a house where Macdonald and Siebold had lodged\r\non their last visit, disregarding the excuses of the officials, who said\r\nit was occupied by a sick person, but we were used to such subterfuges,\r\nand of course there was no sick man there at all. After a while we\r\nreturned to the gig, and rowing up the river in half-an-hour, reached\r\nthe outskirts of the city, where we landed to inspect a house that had\r\nbeen assigned for the accommodation of the foreign representatives. The\r\nlatter intended to negotiate in Ozaka itself, but this idea was\r\nsubsequently abandoned. As this one house was evidently not large enough\r\nfor the representatives and their suites, I said I would go to the\r\ngovernor and ask him to provide other accommodation. The officials\r\nbecame alarmed at this, and at once offered to show us another house, to\r\nwhich they would take us in a boat. As we wished to see something of the\r\ncity, I declined this proposal, and to their horror we proceeded to walk\r\nalong the bank. A dense crowd of people gathered round us, but they were\r\nvery quiet, and after passing the Ajikawa-bashi, the first of the series\r\nof bridges that span the river right up to the castle, we were shown a\r\ntemple which, however, proved to be again insufficient for our needs. It\r\nbeing clear that our guides were not animated by goodwill, I again\r\nmenaced them with a visit to the governor, but here they became utterly\r\nobstinate, and I had to give way. So we returned to our gig, and\r\nresolving to have a good look at the city, got on board and started to\r\nrow up stream.\r\n\r\nBefore long we reached a barrier composed of native boats moored right\r\nacross from bank to bank, with the evident intention of impeding our\r\nfurther progress. Some officials in a guardhouse on the bank shouted to\r\nus to go back, but we pushed straight ashore, and I ascended the steps\r\nto demand the reason of this obstruction. Orders from the governor was\r\nthe reply. A somewhat heated altercation ensued, and I demanded that\r\neither we should be allowed to pass or that I should at once be\r\nconducted to the governor's house. At last they gave way and removed one\r\nor two of the junks, leaving just enough space for our gig. Taking one\r\nof the guardhouse officials on board, we proceeded up the river, not a\r\nlittle proud of our victory over the bumbledom of a city of 400,000\r\npeople, and fully determined to go right up to the castle. Dense crowds\r\nof people collected on the bridges, sometimes yelling and abusing us,\r\nnow and then throwing stones. Hegt began to lose his temper, and drawing\r\nhis revolver, threatened to fire, but I made him put it back in his\r\npouch. We were in no danger, and could not afford to commit murder for\r\nsuch a trifling reason.\r\n\r\nAt last, after grounding once or twice on the sandbanks, we reached the\r\nKiô-bashi just below the castle. On our left was a small boat full of\r\nofficials who called to us to come and report ourselves, while on the\r\nright extended a grassy bank crowded with soldiers dressed in\r\nsemi-European costume, among whom were a few men in plain dress,\r\napparently noblemen's retainers. One of these came down to the water's\r\nedge, close to which we had approached, and shouted out to the Japanese\r\nwho was with us for his name and office. Our man replied: \"Who are you?\"\r\nand they wrangled for about five minutes, while we kept a watchful eye\r\non the straggling soldiery. But it was clearly unadvisable to land in\r\nthe midst of a hostile armed crowd, and we reluctantly turned the boat's\r\nhead down stream, which now carried us swiftly along. The same crowds\r\nstill occupied the bridges, and shouted abusive epithets as we passed,\r\nto the great alarm of the Japanese official, who had not got over Hegt's\r\nfierce demeanour on the way up, and trembled for fear lest there should\r\nbe a row. Landing the poor fellow, whose tone had become remarkably\r\nfainter and humbler since he first made our acquaintance in the morning,\r\nwe pulled out across the bar to the \"Bouncer,\" and in a few minutes more\r\nwere on our way back to Hiôgo, having seen a good deal more of Ozaka\r\nthan any one else, and braved the wrath of multitudinous _yakunins_. I\r\nbegan to feel contempt for the weak-kneed officials who so easily\r\nallowed themselves to be browbeaten by a few Europeans.\r\n\r\nA curious rencontre took place during our stay at Hiôgo. A Satsuma\r\nsteamer was lying in the port, and one day the captain, Arigawa Yakurô,\r\ncame on board the flagship with some of his officers. One of them\r\nremembered having seen me at Kagoshima, and we immediately fraternized\r\nvery heartily. After drinking and smoking a good deal they took leave,\r\npromising to send a boat for me next day to accompany them ashore to a\r\nJapanese dinner. But they forgot their promise. The day after my\r\nexpedition to Ozaka, Siebold and I went on board Arigawa's ship to find\r\nhim on the point of weighing anchor. He was very glad to see us,\r\nabounded in apologies for being unable to fulfil his engagement to give\r\nan _onna gochisô_, and showed us the cabin that had been fitted up for\r\nthe entertainment. This gentleman was too civil by half, but still the\r\ncontrast to the \"offishness\" of the Tycoon's officials was very\r\nagreeable. If I would like to visit Kagoshima and Loochoo he would be\r\nglad to give me a passage. We passed some time on board eating raw eggs\r\nand drinking _saké_. I rather think I here met Kawamura for the first\r\ntime. A few days later when the steamer returned I again went on board\r\nand made an even more interesting acquaintance. This was a big burly\r\nman, with small, sparkling black eyes, who was lying down in one of the\r\nberths. His name, they said, was Shimadzu Sachiû, and I noticed that he\r\nhad the scar of a sword cut on one of his arms. Many months afterwards I\r\nmet him again, this time under his real name of Saigô Kichinosuké. I\r\nshall have more to say of him hereafter.\r\n\r\nAbé Bungo no Kami had a _five hours'_ interview with Sir Harry on the\r\n10th, after which he went on board the \"Guerrière\" to see Mr. Roches,\r\nthe French envoy. I learnt from Siebold that the conversation had not\r\nbeen of a satisfactory character. His answer to the three propositions\r\nof the representatives amounted to a _non possumus_. The Tycoon would\r\npay up the second instalment of the indemnity rather than run the risk\r\nof incurring unpopularity by giving way to our demands. _Jin-shin\r\nfu-ori-ai_, the popular mind very unsettled, was the excuse then, and\r\nfor many a day after. Sir Harry had given Abé a piece of his mind, and\r\nsaid he had better return to his colleagues and get them to reconsider\r\ntheir answer.\r\n\r\nOn the 13th he was to have come down again, but feigning indisposition\r\nas an excuse (this is well-known in Japan under the name of _yaku-biô_,\r\nofficial sickness), he sent a member of the second council, Tachibana\r\nIdzumo no Kami, to inform the representatives that the Tycoon had\r\nhitherto never spoken to the Mikado about acknowledging the treaties,\r\nbut that now he had made up his mind to do so. But he required a delay\r\nof fifteen days for this purpose. The ministers up to this moment had\r\nbelieved, on the faith of assurances given by the Tycoon's council in\r\n1864 after the Shimonoséki business, that the Mikado had long ago been\r\napproached on this subject, and that Abé himself had been entrusted with\r\na mission to Kiôto to that effect. They were therefore naturally both\r\nsurprised and incensed, but consented to a delay of ten days. The\r\nprospects of the negotiation looked very dark indeed. The Tycoon seemed\r\neither unable or unwilling to obtain the Mikado's sanction to the\r\ntreaties, and it began to be thought that we should have to throw him\r\nover entirely. If the Tycoon was controlled by a superior authority, he\r\nwas clearly not the proper person for foreign Powers to deal with, who\r\nmust insist upon direct communication with the authority. For the\r\npresent, however, it was too early to talk of going to see the Mikado\r\nagainst his will. We had not sufficient men in the allied squadrons to\r\nforce a way up to Kiôto, and even if we had, Sir Harry's instructions\r\nwould not have enabled him to take such a step. So there was nothing for\r\nit but to wait.\r\n\r\nAn interesting visit was that of some retainers of Aidzu and Hosokawa,\r\nwho came on board privately to talk politics and to pick up what\r\ninformation they could for their own princes. The former was the\r\ncommander of the Tycoon's garrison in Kiôto, the latter one of the more\r\nimportant _daimiôs_ in the island of Kiûshiû, nominally a partizan of\r\nthe Tycoon, but already beginning to consider whether it would not suit\r\nhim better to go over to the other party. For by this time a definite\r\nissue had been raised between the Tycoon and the court of the Mikado.\r\nThe former being the friend of foreigners and an usurping vassal, the\r\nwar cry of the latter was \"serve the sovereign and expel the\r\nbarbarians.\" My visitors talked a great deal about the \"unsettled state\r\nof popular feeling.\" They said the Mikado had already given his sanction\r\nto the treaties in a general sort of way, and had consented to Nagasaki,\r\nHakodaté and Shimoda being opened to foreign trade. But Kanagawa had\r\nbeen substituted for the latter port without his approval. They felt\r\nquite certain that the Mikado would not agree at present to the\r\nestablishment of foreign merchants at Hiôgo. They maintained that the\r\nanti-foreign feeling was pretty general among the people, but admitted\r\nthat Chôshiû made use of it as a mere party cry with the object of\r\ndispossessing the Tycoon of his power.\r\n\r\nAfter an interval of five days Tachibana paid Sir Harry another visit.\r\nHe reported that the Tycoon had not yet started for Kiôto to obtain the\r\nMikado's ratification of the treaties, being detained at Ozaka by a\r\nheadache! Abé and Ogasawara were afflicted with indisposition which\r\nprevented their having the pleasure of coming down to call on the\r\nBritish minister. Sir Harry administered some home-truths to the\r\nunfortunate prevaricator, and demonstrated very clearly to him that as\r\nthe council acknowledged the inability of the Tycoon to carry out the\r\ntreaty stipulations in respect of the opening of new ports without the\r\nMikado's consent, which they had little hope of obtaining and still less\r\ndesire to get, they must eventually go to the wall, and the foreign\r\nPowers would be compelled to make a demand for the ratification direct\r\non the Mikado. It was pitiable to see the shifts that the Tycoon's\r\nofficials were put to in face of his merciless logic; they were\r\nperpetually being driven into a corner and left without a leg to stand\r\non.\r\n\r\nThe demands presented by the foreign representatives had created a\r\nconsiderable movement at Kiôto, and dissension followed among the\r\nadvisers of the Tycoon. In a few days we heard that Abé and Matsumai\r\nIdzu no Kami had been dismissed from office. They were believed to be in\r\nfavour of accepting our demands, and their disgrace seemed to threaten\r\nthe failure of the negotiations. The representatives thereupon resolved\r\non the important step of addressing a _note identique_ to the Tycoon\r\nhimself, containing a repetition of the demands already made, and\r\nwarning him that if an answer were not made within the period of ten\r\ndays originally fixed, it would be assumed by them that their\r\npropositions were refused. M. Mermet and I went ashore together to\r\ndeliver the letters of our respective chiefs, and I learnt that the\r\nindefatigable little man had translated the French copy into Japanese\r\nand induced his minister to sign the translation. He had also addressed\r\nit to the council, instead of to the Tycoon, though he told me\r\notherwise. On our arrival at the governor's house, he wrapped it in a\r\nsheet of Japanese paper, in order that I might not see the address, but\r\nthe officials who received the Notes, of whom I afterwards inquired,\r\nvoluntarily assured me that it was addressed to the council at Ozaka.\r\nWhat Mermet's object can have been I was not able to conjecture, and it\r\nis probable that he did it merely to keep his hand in. It is a dangerous\r\nthing for an habitual intriguer to get out of practice by acting\r\nstraightforwardly, even in unimportant matters. We learnt that the\r\nTycoon had presented a memorial to the Mikado urging him to ratify the\r\ntreaties as well for his own sake as for that of the nation in general.\r\nThat on its being refused, he had resolved to return to Yedo, but was\r\nstopped by an order from the court before he had got half-way to Ozaka.\r\n\r\nThe dismissal of the pro-foreign members of the council seemed to\r\nforebode resistance and the probable outbreak of hostilities. Japanese\r\nsteamers lying at Ozaka got up steam and went off in every direction,\r\nsome passing through Hiôgo on their way. Siebold and I pulled on board\r\none of these which belonged to Satsuma, and learnt that she was going\r\noff to Yura in Kishiû in order to be out of the way in case the Mikado\r\nshould issue such orders to the Tycoon as might result in war-like\r\nmeasures being taken by the allied squadron. On the 24th, the last day,\r\nnotice was given to the governor of Hiôgo that the ships would move on\r\nthe morrow to Ozaka to await there the answer of the Tycoon's\r\ngovernment. From him we learnt that Ogasawara would surely be down next\r\nday with the reply, but as had already happened so often in the course\r\nof these negotiations, he was ill, and Matsudaira Hôki no Kami took his\r\nplace. The interview with the foreign representatives lasted several\r\nhours, but the gist of it was that the Tycoon had at last obtained the\r\nMikado's consent to the treaties, by his own urgent representations,\r\nbacked by those of his cousin Shitotsubashi, who declared (so it was\r\nsaid) that he would perform disembowelment unless the Mikado yielded. At\r\nlast the latter gave way, saying \"Well, speak to the nobles of my court\r\nabout it.\" The opening of Hiôgo was, however, to be still deferred until\r\nJanuary 1, 1868, but the tariff would be revised, and the remaining\r\ninstalments of the indemnity paid punctually. Thus the foreign\r\nrepresentatives had obtained two out of the three conditions, and those\r\nthe most important, while giving up nothing in return. It must, however,\r\nbe acknowledged that the payment of the indemnity was never completed by\r\nthe Tycoon, and survived the revolution to be a constant source of\r\nirritation and ill-feeling between the Mikado's government and the\r\nBritish minister.\r\n\r\nHôki no Kami, on leaving the \"Princess Royal,\" promised that a note\r\nembodying these arrangements should be sent off in the course of the\r\nevening. But as it had to be sent up to Ozaka to receive the signatures\r\nof his two remaining colleagues, the document did not reach us before\r\nhalf-past two in the morning. I sat up till that hour in expectation of\r\nits arrival, and was called into the cabin to read it to Sir Harry and\r\nM. Roches, and then make a translation. The Mikado's decree to his\r\nvizier the Kwambaku delegating the conduct of foreign affairs to the\r\nTycoon, a short document of only three lines, was enclosed in it. At Sir\r\nHarry's request Hôki no Kami added an engagement to promulgate the\r\ndecree throughout the country. It was a proud night for me when I\r\ndisplayed my knowledge of written Japanese in the presence of the French\r\nminister, whose interpreter, M. Mermet, even could not read a document\r\nwithout the assistance of his teacher.\r\n\r\nThus successfully ended the negotiations which up to the day before\r\nshowed no signs of fruit. The foreign representatives had to\r\ncongratulate themselves on having secured the means of tranquillizing\r\nthe country, while at the same time consolidating the relations between\r\nthe Japanese people and foreign nations. The opening of Hiôgo on the 1st\r\nJanuary 1866 was a concession which few people had been sanguine enough\r\nto expect, but something had been secured which was of more immediate\r\nvalue, namely the solemn reiterated promise of the council to adhere to\r\nthe London agreement of 1862. It was hoped also on good grounds that Sir\r\nRutherford's convention of the previous October would also be carried\r\nout in its entirety. At dinner the following evening the Admiral made a\r\nspeech, proposing Sir Harry's health and giving to him the whole credit\r\nof the success achieved. He replied by disclaiming any merit, and\r\nattributing a far greater share of the achievement to M. Roches; \"but\r\nafter all,\" he added, \"it was you who did it, Admiral, for without you\r\nand your magnificent ship, we should not have made the slightest\r\nimpression.\"\r\n\r\nOn our return to Yokohama we found that the wildest rumours had been\r\nflying about. The United States Chargé d'Affaires, Portman, was said to\r\nhave been killed, and Sir Harry taken prisoner, while Siebold and myself\r\nwere also reported to have fallen martyrs to the cause. The \"Japan\r\nTimes,\" a newspaper conducted by Charles Rickerby, affected to pooh-pooh\r\nthe whole affair, and denied the authenticity of the Mikado's decree,\r\nwhich, he said, ought to have been covered with seals. I wrote a letter\r\nto his paper, controverting his arguments, but without convincing him.\r\nThere was one point about it, however, that escaped notice at the time,\r\nnamely that the existing treaties were not explicitly sanctioned. All\r\nthat the Mikado had given was a general authority to conclude treaties\r\nwith foreign countries, and he had added a rider enjoining on the Tycoon\r\nthe cancellation of the undertaking to open Hiôgo and Ozaka to trade.\r\nThis, however, was carefully concealed from the foreign representatives,\r\nand we only came to know of it later. But without seeing it, no one\r\ncould have guessed that the document represented to the foreign\r\nministers to be the Mikado's sanction to the existing treaties had not\r\nthat meaning, because of the absence of the definite article in\r\nJapanese. In English it makes a great deal of difference whether you say\r\n\"the treaties are sanctioned,\" or simply \"treaties are sanctioned,\" but\r\nin Japanese the same form of expression does for both, and we had no\r\nground for suspecting the Tycoon's ministers of taking refuge in an\r\nambiguity in order to play a trick on us and to gain time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XIV\r\n\r\n                         GREAT FIRE AT YOKOHAMA\r\n\r\n\r\nIN pursuance of instructions from the chief, I proceeded to Yedo the day\r\nafter my return to find out if possible what had been the popular\r\nfeeling about our doings at Hiôgo, but did not succeed in discovering\r\nanything of importance. A general curiosity prevailed, and the result of\r\nthe negotiations was yet unknown. A meeting of the _daimiôs_' agents had\r\nbeen held on the receipt of the news that two of the council had been\r\ndismissed, and it was rumoured that the Tycoon had asked to be allowed\r\nto retire, but that his petition had been rejected. I stopped at the\r\nmonastery of Dai-chiû-ji, which had been temporarily lent to Sir Harry\r\nfor a residence. It was in a convenient position, nearer to the centre\r\nof the city than our former location at Tô-zen-ji, but the rooms were\r\ndark and scarcely numerous enough for the accommodation of the staff in\r\naddition to the minister and his family. A new building had therefore\r\nbeen already commenced in front of Sen-gaku-ji, about half-way between\r\nthe two, and, instead of being called the British Legation, was to be\r\nnamed the _setsu-gu-jo_ or \"place for meeting (sc. foreigners),\" in\r\norder to avoid the risk of its being burnt down by the anti-foreign\r\nparty. Report said that the Prince of Sendai, offended at not having\r\nbeen consulted on this matter, had retired to his castle in great\r\ndudgeon. Sen-gaku-ji is a well-known monastery containing the tombs and\r\neffigies of the celebrated \"Forty-seven faithful retainers.\" After a\r\ncouple of days' stay at the capital, I returned to my duties at the\r\nconsulate in Yokohama, where I now held the post of interpreter.\r\n\r\nI was beginning to become known among the Japanese as a foreigner who\r\ncould speak their language correctly, and my circle of acquaintance\r\nrapidly extended. Men used to come down from Yedo on purpose to talk to\r\nme, moved as much by mere curiosity as by a desire to find out what\r\nforeign policy towards their country was likely to be. Owing to my name\r\nbeing a common Japanese surname, it was easily passed on from one to\r\nanother, and I was talked about by people whom I had never met. The\r\ntwo-sworded men were always happy to get a glass of wine or liqueur and\r\na foreign cigar, and they were fond of discussion. They would sit for\r\nhours if the subject interested them. Politics afforded the principal\r\nmaterial of our debates, which sometimes became rather warm. I used to\r\nattack the abuses of the existing régime, and then explain that I liked\r\nthem very much, but hated despotic institutions. Many of the men who\r\nvisited me were retainers of _daimiôs_, from whom I gained every day a\r\nfirmer conviction that the Tycoon ought not to be regarded by foreigners\r\nas the sovereign of the country, and that sooner or later we must enter\r\ninto direct relations with the Mikado. And the state papers, of which\r\ncopies came into my hands through these men, proved that the Tycoon\r\nregarded himself as nothing more than the Mikado's principal vassal. At\r\nthe same time the Tycoon's ministers still persevered in their endeavour\r\nto keep the conduct of foreign affairs in their own hands, and had\r\nsucceeded in persuading Mr. Winchester that this was an ancient and\r\nindefeasible prerogative of the Tokugawa family. Sir Harry Parkes,\r\nhowever, from the first, with clearer insight, held that this was\r\nuntenable, and resolved to press matters to a definite solution, which\r\nshould bring the sovereign face to face with foreign Powers.\r\n\r\nSir Harry had gone over to Shanghai to meet Lady Parkes and his\r\nchildren, and immediately after his return set to work at the revision\r\nof the tariff on the basis agreed to at Hiôgo. The negotiations, which\r\nbegan about January 1866, took much less time than is usual in these\r\ndays, and the new convention was signed in June. I had little to do with\r\nit beyond assisting in its translation into Japanese. In February he\r\nbegan to make use of me as a translator, in addition to my work at the\r\nconsulate.\r\n\r\nMy salary as interpreter at the Yokohama consulate, which I had joined\r\nin April 1865, was only £400 a year, and after the Hiôgo business, where\r\nI had demonstrated my knowledge of the Japanese language, I began to\r\nthink my services worth quite as much as those of the Dutch\r\ninterpreters, who received £500. At an interview with the Japanese\r\nministers they used to translate into Dutch what the minister said, and\r\nthe native Dutch interpreters translated this again into Japanese. The\r\nreply had in the same way to go through two men. But when Siebold or I\r\ninterpreted, the work was performed much more quickly and accurately,\r\nbecause we translated direct into Japanese. It was the same with the\r\nofficial correspondence, for I was able, with the assistance of a native\r\nwriter, and sometimes without, to put an official note directly into\r\nJapanese. Then I was able to read and translate into English all sorts\r\nof confidential political papers, which the Dutch interpreters could\r\nmake nothing of. We took a bold resolution, and in August 1866, Sir\r\nHarry having given me a quantity of political documents to translate, we\r\naddressed letters to him asking that he would recommend us to the\r\nForeign Office for an additional £100 a year. This brought down his\r\nwrath upon our heads, and I became convinced that my application would\r\nbe refused. Under these circumstances I wrote to my father that the\r\nservice was not worth remaining in. At that time the telegraph reached\r\nonly to Ceylon, but in as short a time as possible I received a telegram\r\nfrom him telling me to come home at once, and that I should have an\r\nallowance sufficient to enable me to go to the university and afterwards\r\nto the bar. Armed with this, I approached Sir Harry again, and asked him\r\nto accept my resignation. I had received a telegram from home which\r\nnecessitated my immediate return to England. After a little humming and\r\nhawing, he finally produced from a drawer a despatch from Lord\r\nClarendon, which had been lying there for several days, granting the\r\napplications of both Siebold and myself, and I consequently abandoned my\r\nintention of quitting the service.\r\n\r\nAbout March 6, 1866, a review and sham fight were held of the English\r\ngarrison in combination with the Japanese drilled troops commanded by\r\nKubota Sentarô on the dry rice fields between Jiû-ni-ten and Hommoku.\r\nThe enemy was entirely imaginary, his place being taken by a crowd of\r\nspectators. The marching of the Japanese was very good, and received all\r\nthe greater praise because they had received no practical instruction.\r\nTheir officers had got it up from books, the difficult passages being\r\nexplained to them by ours. The English soldiers looked magnificent by\r\nthe side of the rather dwarfish Japanese. The bluejackets from the fleet\r\nwere very amusing; one or two got drunk and danced a hornpipe in the\r\nface of the supposed enemy, to the great wrath and disgust of their\r\ncommander, a young lieutenant. There was the usual amount of firing with\r\nblank cartridge, which, when it comes from one side only, renders every\r\none so plucky and desirous of charging the foe. It was a wonder that no\r\nramrods were fired away, nor was any one hit by a wad. The day was\r\nuniversally voted a great success.\r\n\r\nThe 2/xx regiment was despatched to Hongkong about March 20, and\r\nreplaced by the 2/ix.\r\n\r\nThe danger to foreigners had so much abated since the execution of the\r\nmurderers of Bird and Baldwin, and the ratification of the treaties by\r\nthe Mikado that we began freely to make excursions into the surrounding\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nOn one occasion I went away for a few days with Charles Rickerby of the\r\n\"Japan Times,\" and having thus become intimate with him, was permitted\r\nto try my inexperienced pen in the columns of his paper. My first\r\nattempt was an article upon travelling in Japan, but before long an\r\nincident occurred which tempted me to write on politics. It was\r\ndoubtless very irregular, very wrong, and altogether contrary to the\r\nrules of the service, but I thought little of that. A Satsuma trading\r\nsteamer had come into the bay, and was ordered by the authorities to\r\nanchor far away on the Kanagawa side, so that there might be no\r\ncommunication between the foreign community and the people on board.\r\nTaking this for my text, I descanted on the insufficiency of the\r\ntreaties concluded with the Tycoon, which confined us to commercial\r\nintercourse with the inhabitants of his dominions, and thus cut us off\r\nfrom relations with a good half of the country. I called therefore for a\r\nrevision of the treaties, and for a remodelling of the constitution of\r\nthe Japanese government. My proposal was that the Tycoon should descend\r\nto his proper position as a great territorial noble, and that a\r\nconfederation of daimiôs under the headship of the Mikado should take\r\nhis place as the ruling power. And then I proceeded to make various\r\nsuggestions for the improvement and modification of the existing\r\ntreaties. With the aid of my teacher, Numata Torasaburô, a retainer of\r\nthe Prince of Awa, who knew some English, I put them into Japanese in\r\nthe form of a pamphlet for the perusal of his prince, but copies got\r\ninto circulation, and in the following year I found myself to be\r\nfavourably known through this means to all the _daimiôs_ retainers whom\r\nI met in the course of my journeys. In the end the translation was\r\nprinted and sold in all the bookshops at Ozaka and Kiôto under the title\r\nof \"Ei-koku Saku-ron,\" English policy, by the Englishman Satow, and was\r\nassumed by both parties to represent the views of the British Legation.\r\nWith this of course I had nothing to do. As far as I know it never came\r\nto the ears of my chief, but it may fairly be supposed to have been not\r\nwithout its influence upon the relations between the English Legation\r\nand the new government afterwards established in the beginning of 1868.\r\nAt the same time, it doubtless rendered us more or less \"suspect\" to the\r\nTycoon's government while the latter lasted.\r\n\r\nDuring Sir Harry's absence in July on a visit to the _daimiôs_ of\r\nSatsuma and Uwajima after the signature of the tariff convention, some\r\nof us at the legation made up a party with three or four officers of the\r\nix regiment, and went for a trip to Hachiôji and Atsugi. In those days\r\nall the high roads were intersected at certain points by strictly\r\nguarded barriers, where all travellers had to show their passports.\r\nBeyond Hachiôji a few miles to the west was one of these, just at the\r\nfoot of a hill known as Takao-zan, about 1600 feet high, with a good\r\nroad to the top. Up this we rode on our sure-footed ponies, and after\r\nlunching under the shade of the lofty cryptomerias, descended to the\r\nhigh road again, but unintentionally reached it beyond the barrier. The\r\nguards, who were inclined to interpret their duties rather too strictly\r\nthan otherwise, shut the gates and refused to let us pass. It was in\r\nvain that we explained our mistake; they had orders not to let\r\nforeigners through. One would have thought that as we were on the side\r\nwhere we had no business to be, and were desirous of getting back to the\r\nright side, the officers in command would have facilitated our wishes to\r\nrepair our error. But nothing would move them. At last Willis, who stood\r\n6 feet 8 inches in his stockings and weighed then about 20 stone, made\r\nas if he would charge the gate on his pony, and seriously alarmed lest\r\nhe should batter the whole thing down in a rush, they prudently flung it\r\nopen, and we rode through triumphantly.\r\n\r\nA similar incident occurred on another occasion when I was out with\r\nFrancis Myburgh, Captain W. G. Jones, R.N., of the flagship, and Charles\r\nWirgman. The limit of excursions from Yokohama in the direction of the\r\ncapital was formed by the Tama-gawa, which in the treaties is called the\r\nLogo river (a corruption of Rokugô). We had slept at Mizoguchi, and\r\nascended the right bank on horseback to Sekido, where without difficulty\r\nwe induced the ferryman to put us across, and rode into the town of\r\nFuchiû to visit a well-known Shintô temple. We were bound for a\r\nmonastery on the other side of the river, where we had planned to spend\r\nthe night, and to do this it was necessary to recross further up to the\r\nBuddhist monastery of Ren-kô-ji. But on arriving there, and shouting to\r\nthe ferryman, we got a blank refusal, accompanied by the information\r\nthat we had no business to be where we were. \"We know that we are, and\r\nwant to get back where we ought to be.\" _Ferryman_: \"Can't help that.\r\nOur orders are not to ferry any foreigner over.\" It was impossible to\r\nconvince him that though he would be right in refusing to facilitate a\r\nbreach of the law, he was bound to assist the repentant and contrite\r\noffenders in repairing such a breach, and we saw ourselves menaced with\r\nseparation from our baggage and perhaps a cold night on the stones. Just\r\nabove the ferry was a shallower spot, too deep to cross on ponies\r\nwithout getting rather wet. Charles Wirgman and I therefore took off our\r\ntrousers, and tucking our shirts up as high as possible waded to the\r\nother bank, walked down to the ferry house, jumped into the boat before\r\nthe ferrymen had time to recover from their surprise at our audacity,\r\npoled it across to our friends amid cries of _Koré wa rambô-rôzeki_\r\n(about equivalent to \"Robbery and murder\") from the guardians of the\r\nposts, and so got the whole party across.\r\n\r\nOn the 26th of November occurred one of the most destructive fires with\r\nwhich Yokohama has ever been visited. One fourth of the foreign\r\nsettlement and one-third of the native town were laid in ashes. The\r\nfire-bell began to ring about nine o'clock in the morning. Willis and I\r\nascended to the look-out on the roof of our house and saw the flames\r\nmounting to the sky exactly to windward of us, maybe half a mile away. I\r\nrushed into a pair of boots (unluckily my oldest), and putting on my\r\nhat, hastened forth to find out the location of the fire. My servants\r\nsaid it was only a few doors off, but when I got that distance it proved\r\nto be further away, and I pursued my course for a quarter of an hour\r\nbefore arriving on the scene. From the lower end of a narrow street,\r\nusually well crowded but now absolutely crammed with people, there\r\nsurged along an agitated multitude carrying such of their goods as they\r\nhad been able to snatch from the devouring element that closely pursued\r\nthem. I approached as near as I could to the burning houses, but finding\r\nthat the conflagration was rapidly advancing, beat a hasty retreat and\r\nmade my way to the open space at the back of the settlement, where a\r\nterrible spectacle of confusion presented itself to my eyes. The portion\r\nof the native town where the fire was raging most violently was on a\r\nsmall island surrounded by a muddy swamp and connected with the rest of\r\nYokohama by a wooden bridge, already crowded with fugitives; to wade or\r\nswim across to the firm ground was impossible. There were one or two\r\nboats available, but they were already overcrowded, and their occupants\r\nwere so paralysed by fear that they never thought of landing and sending\r\nback the boats to take off others. Most of the inhabitants of the\r\nquarter were women. I saw a few poor wretches plunge into the water in\r\norder to escape, but they failed to reach the nearer bank. It was a\r\nfearful sight to see the flames darting among the roofs of the houses on\r\nthe causeway, and sending forth jets here and there where the fire had\r\nnot yet attained full mastery, when suddenly one half of the street\r\nnearest blazed up with a tremendous flash, and a volume of black smoke\r\narose which obscured the sky. This was an oil merchant's shop that had\r\ncaught fire. I turned and fled homewards, for there was no time to lose.\r\nI knew my own house was doomed, as it lay directly to leeward, and a\r\nviolent wind was blowing from the north-west. As I passed through the\r\nlittle garden I shouted to Willis to bestir himself, and called my\r\nservants to assist in packing up my movables. My first thought was for\r\nmy MS. dictionary; if that went I lost the results of two years' labour.\r\nSo I put it into a light chest of drawers, and huddled some clothes in\r\nfrom the wardrobe. To get our things out we had to break down the high\r\nwooden fence round the garden. At this moment up came some friends, who\r\nplunged into the house and reappeared, some with books, others with half\r\na chest of drawers, and we worked with a will until the building was\r\ncleared of everything but carpets, curtains, and the heavier furniture.\r\nMy harmonium, a massive article, was also got into the street, and some\r\nmen from the garrison carried it away to a place of safety.\r\n\r\nBy the time we had removed the salvage to what we thought was a\r\nrespectable distance, the fire had reached the house, which five minutes\r\nlater was a heap of glowing embers. It now became evident that the\r\nhouses in the rear of the settlement had caught fire, and as my property\r\nwas lying on the open space between the foreign and native towns, it had\r\nto be transported further. Here occurred a serious loss. Most of my\r\nbooks were in boxes which had been carried out bodily, but the rest,\r\nhastily wrapped up in blankets, had to be left. There were plenty of\r\npilferers about, who, under the pretence of helping, carried off chests\r\nfull of clothing that I never saw again. I lost a good many European\r\nvolumes and a large number of Japanese books, besides some notes on\r\nManchu and Chinese which were irreplaceable.\r\n\r\nAfter we had deposited our property where we thought it would be in\r\nsafety, it was threatened by the progress of the flames, and was\r\ntherefore removed to a godown belonging to our friends Wilkin and\r\nRobison at No. 3 in the settlement. By this time the area of destruction\r\nhad extended to the main street of the native town, and the houses where\r\nA. B. Mitford, A. von Siebold, Walsh and Vidal lived, as well as our\r\nown, had already gone. A Japanese house lightly built of wood, with\r\npaper instead of glass, takes little time to burn. Next the fire spread\r\nto the nearest houses in the foreign settlement. Huge sparks and pieces\r\nof red hot wood flew across the intervening space, set the American\r\nconsulate alight, ignited the roof of Jardine, Matheson & Co., and began\r\nto spread along both streets of the settlement. The supposed \"fireproof\"\r\ngodown where most of our things were deposited caught fire, and nearly\r\neverything we had saved was destroyed. It was a scene of the wildest\r\nconfusion. Bluejackets were landed from the ships, and soldiers came\r\ndown from the camp to work at the fire engines. There was no discipline\r\namong the men, and no organization existed for dealing with the\r\ndisaster. After the final destruction of my own property I went about\r\nhelping others to save theirs or to fight the flames, handing buckets,\r\nfetching water, pouring it on whatever seemed most inflammable. Some of\r\nthe redcoats behaved disgracefully. They had managed to get hold of\r\nliquor, and stood by drinking and jeering, while we civilians did the\r\nwork they had been brought there to perform. At the close of the day\r\nthere remained to me only the clothes I had on my back, and I was\r\nhatless. But the excitement had been so lively that I felt rather\r\npleased at the idea of beginning the world afresh. I had saved the\r\nmanuscript of the English-Japanese dictionary on which Ishibashi and I\r\nwere then engaged, as well as that of an annotated edition of Sir R.\r\nAlcock's _Colloquial Japanese_, which was then in the press, though\r\ndestined never to see the light. My loss came to between £300 and £400,\r\na portion of which was afterwards made good to me by Her Majesty's\r\nGovernment. The losses of the insurance offices amounted to $2,800,000,\r\nor about £700,000. The value of what was not insured was not great.\r\n\r\nThe conflagration raged so fiercely among the foreign warehouses and\r\nresidences that before four o'clock in the afternoon it had made its way\r\nhalf down the bund, leaving only the club-house standing, and at one\r\nperiod it was thought that the whole settlement would be in a blaze\r\nbefore night. If that had happened the European community would have had\r\nto seek an asylum on board ship, but fortunately our fears were not\r\nrealized. The flames seemed invincible by the side of our puny efforts.\r\n\r\nThe expedient was resorted to of blowing up houses in the line of fire,\r\nbut not with great success, for some of those so destroyed were never\r\ntouched by it at all, while in other instances the _débris_ could not be\r\ncleared away, and only helped it to spread to the buildings beyond. One\r\nhundred and seven Europeans and Americans were rendered homeless, and\r\nmany of those who had trusted in their so-called fireproof godowns were\r\nleft without anything in the world but the clothes they stood in.\r\nMerchants whose goods were uninsured were devoured by a terrible\r\nanxiety, for the most solidly-constructed stone godowns seemed to offer\r\nlittle more resistance than the wooden houses of the Japanese.\r\n\r\nAlthough the wind had fallen, much apprehension was entertained for the\r\nsafety of what still remained unburnt, for owing to the damaged\r\ncondition of the hose, all the fire engines had become useless, and\r\nnothing could be done to extinguish the smouldering embers. The fire was\r\ntherefore left to burn itself out, and four days elapsed before the\r\nflames entirely died down. The price of clothing rose incredibly, as\r\nalso did house rent. Yokohama was not as well supplied with hatters,\r\ntailors and bootmakers as it is in these days, and most men were in the\r\nhabit of supplying themselves from home. For the next two years,\r\nconsequently, I was reduced to a very moderate wardrobe. I had, for\r\nexample, to pay $4, or 18 shillings, for five pocket handkerchiefs.\r\n\r\nAfter the fire I took up my abode with my friend Tom Foster, then the\r\nmanager of Gilman & Co.'s Yokohama branch, until the 9th or 10th of\r\nDecember, when I migrated to the Legation at Yedo. The new buildings in\r\nfront of Sen-gaku-ji were now completed, and enclosed by a lofty black\r\nwooden fence which imparted to the establishment somewhat of the aspect\r\nof a jail. There were two long wooden buildings, one of which was the\r\nminister's residence, the other being occupied by the members of the\r\nchancery. Eusden had gone to Hakodaté as acting consul, and the staff\r\nconsisted of Mitford as second secretary, Willis as assistant accountant\r\nand medical officer, Siebold and myself as interpreters, and Vidal as\r\nstudent interpreter. The infantry guard was commanded by Lieutenant\r\nBradshaw. Sidney Locock, the first secretary, a married man with a\r\nfamily, lived at Yokohama, as did also H. S. Wilkinson, still a student.\r\nThey were \"ramshackle\" buildings, all windows and doors, terribly cold\r\nfrom want of proper fireplaces and bad construction, which admitted\r\ndraughts on every side. But I did not live there long.\r\n\r\nAfter my transfer from the Yokohama consulate to the Legation in the\r\nautumn of 1866, one of the first matters in which I was able to be of\r\nuse to our new chief was connected with the wording of the treaty. In\r\nthe English text the Tycoon was spoken of as \"His Majesty,\" and thus\r\nplaced on a level with the Queen. In the Japanese version, however, this\r\nepithet was rendered by the equivalent of \"Highness,\" and it was thus to\r\nbe inferred that our sovereign was of lower rank than the Mikado.\r\nMoreover, the word \"queen\" had been translated by a title which was\r\nborne by great-grand-daughters of a Mikado. I recommended that a new\r\nJapanese version should be made, in which \"Majesty\" should be rendered\r\nby its proper Japanese equivalent, and \"Queen\" by the word _Kôtei_\r\n(Hwang-ti), usually translated by \"Emperor\" in all the Chinese-English\r\ndictionaries, but really meaning \"supreme sovereign,\" and applicable to\r\nboth sexes. The preparation of the new version was entrusted to my\r\nhands, and with the aid of my teacher I managed in about a month's time\r\nto complete an accurate translation, which was adopted as official. It\r\nwas the keynote of a new policy which recognized the Mikado as the\r\nsovereign of Japan and the Tycoon as his lieutenant. We gave up the use\r\nof \"Tycoon,\" which my reading had taught me was properly a synonym for\r\nthe Mikado, in our communications with the Japanese government, though\r\nretaining it in correspondence with the Foreign Office, in order not to\r\ncreate confusion, but the most important result was to set in a clearer\r\nlight than before the political theory that the Mikado was the\r\ntreaty-making power. As long as his consent had not been obtained to the\r\nexisting treaties we had no _locus standi_, while after he had been\r\ninduced to ratify them, the opposition of the _daimiôs_ ceased to have\r\nany logical basis.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER XV\r\n\r\n                     VISIT TO KAGOSHIMA AND UWAJIMA\r\n\r\n\r\nA FEW days after I had assumed my new duties, and had settled down, as I\r\nthought, for a period of uninterrupted study, Sir Harry informed me that\r\nhe contemplated sending me down to Nagasaki in the \"Princess Royal,\"\r\nwhich was about to proceed thither through the inland sea, to collect\r\npolitical information at Hiôgo and elsewhere. I was to return in the\r\n\"Argus\" by way of Kagoshima and Uwajima. The Tycoon had recently died,\r\nand had been succeeded by his cousin Shitotsubashi, whose position,\r\nhowever, was not very clearly defined. Before his elevation to the\r\nheadship of the Tokugawa family he had been regarded as a partisan of\r\nthe \"return to the ancient régime,\" now so much in men's mouths, and it\r\nwas desirable to learn as much as possible of his probable line of\r\npolicy. In Yedo we were too far away from the political centre to learn\r\nmuch. I was greatly pleased at the prospect of visiting Nagasaki, but\r\ntook care not to seem too desirous of being sent on the proposed\r\nmission, lest over-eagerness should defeat itself. Next day I got a note\r\nfrom Sir Harry, who resided chiefly at Yokohama, telling me that he had\r\nnot yet seen the Admiral, but that he still thought I should have to go.\r\nSo I packed up some clothes in a wicker basket such as the Japanese use\r\nwhen travelling, and went down to Yokohama in the gunboat which was our\r\nprincipal means of conveyance between the two places. In the evening I\r\nlearnt that the matter had been arranged, and that the \"Princess Royal\"\r\nwould sail the next day but one. I wrote to Willis for his teacher\r\nHayashi, whom I intended to put ashore at Hiôgo to collect news, and for\r\na tin box containing some stationery, and a little money, but neither\r\narrived in time. In despair I borrowed a few hundred _ichibus_ from\r\nFoster, bought a box of cheroots, wrapped a few sheets of foolscap in a\r\nnewspaper, and got on board on the 12th December just in time.\r\n\r\nWe had fine weather for our start, but encountered a strong westerly\r\nwind outside, which prevented our passing between Vries Island and the\r\nmainland. For four days I lay in my cot, utterly unable to eat, but\r\nconsoling myself with reference to previous experiences of the same\r\nkind. At last I was revived by a plateful of greasy beefsteak pudding\r\nthat Admiral King sent me, and a glass of champagne. The gale had not\r\nabated, and the huge two decker rolled terribly. At one time the betting\r\nwas strong on Hongkong as our first port of anchorage, and Hiôgo was\r\ngiven up as quite unattainable. Hakodaté, Yokohama and Nagasaki rose by\r\nturns to the position of favourite. We were blown right out of the chart\r\nof Japan, and at last, after many days of tossing to and fro, tacking\r\nand wearing, we sighted the Linschoten Islands, where we turned to the\r\nnorth, and steaming as fast as 400 horse power will carry a vessel of\r\n3500 tons, got into Nagasaki on the evening of the 23rd.\r\n\r\nThe appearance of the town and foreign settlement, lighted up by\r\ninnumerable lamps dotted all over the hillsides, reminded me of\r\nGibraltar as I had seen it from the deck of the \"Indus\" a little more\r\nthan five years previously.\r\n\r\nAt Nagasaki I made the acquaintance of some retainers of Uwajima, the\r\nmost important of whom was Iséki Sayemon, afterwards prefect of Yokohama\r\nin the first years of the Mikado's rule. He came to call on me, and said\r\nthat the proposed assemblage of a council of _daimiôs_ at Kiôto had been\r\nput off for the present. But it was sure to take place eventually, and\r\none of the first topics of discussion would be the position of Chôshiû.\r\nAbout half of Shi-koku was in favour of Hiôgo being opened to foreign\r\ntrade, but the Kiûshiû people opposed it, on account of the anticipated\r\ndecline of Nagasaki. He thought that the visit of the Admiral and Sir\r\nHarry Parkes in the \"Princess Royal\" to Uwajima had done immense good,\r\nby familiarizing the common people with the appearance of foreigners,\r\nand their ingenuity in the construction of ships and warlike appliances.\r\nThe _daimiô_ of Uwajima and his brother the _ex-daimiô_ (who was the\r\nleading spirit of the clan) had excused themselves on the ground of\r\nsickness from attending the council at Kiôto. Shitotsubashi had not yet\r\nbeen invested with the office of Shôgun and its attendant court titles,\r\nand the probability was that they would be withheld until he had settled\r\nthe Chôshiû difficulty, which would doubtless give him a good deal of\r\ntrouble. When I met him again on the following day the conversation\r\nturned upon our relations with Chôshiû. I told him that the British\r\nGovernment had stationed a man-of-war at Shimonoséki to prevent merchant\r\nvessels frequenting the straits during the continuance of hostilities\r\nbetween Chôshiû and the Tycoon; we did not wish to interfere in any of\r\nthe civil quarrels of the Japanese. We were at peace with Chôshiû, who\r\nhad agreed to let foreign vessels pass without molestation, and had\r\nundertaken to let them purchase wood, water, and other necessaries,\r\nwhile promising to build no more batteries.\r\n\r\nThe Tycoon's government had undertaken to pay the indemnity imposed upon\r\nthe Prince of Chôshiû. The powers, however, did not care for the money,\r\nand would be willing at any time to abandon the indemnity if their doing\r\nso would tend to the improvement of relations with Japan. The Tycoon's\r\npeople had asked for delay in making payment of the remaining\r\ninstalments, and in consenting to this, the foreign ministers had\r\nobtained in return the concession of permission for Japanese to travel\r\nin foreign countries. It was to be supposed, however, that the nation\r\nwas desirous of having the ancient prohibition removed, and the\r\ngovernment would have had, therefore, no excuse for maintaining it.\r\nHiôgo would certainly be opened on the 1st of January 1868 in accordance\r\nwith the undertaking entered into by the Tycoon; the intention of the\r\nPowers was to uphold the treaties in their entirety and get them carried\r\nout. We could not ask for the opening of Shimonoséki under the present\r\ntreaties, as the Tycoon's authority did not extend so far. It would\r\nrequire a separate treaty with Chôshiû. As long as the present treaties\r\nremained unchanged, no ports could be opened in _daimiôs_' territories.\r\n\r\nAt Hiôgo we had discussed matters with the Tycoon's Council, who, we now\r\nlearnt, had deceived us by concealing the Mikado's injunction to them to\r\nnegotiate for the abandonment of Ozaka and Hiôgo as seats of foreign\r\ncommerce. It was a pity we had not thrown them over, and negotiated\r\ndirect with the Mikado's court, from which we heard that a noble had\r\nbeen deputed to visit the foreign representatives.\r\n\r\nDuring my stay at Nagasaki I made the acquaintance of officers from Tosa\r\nand Higo. One of the latter said that there never would be another\r\nShôgun, but that the Mikado would be restored to the throne. Here was a\r\nclear glimpse into the future. My instructions from Sir Harry were to\r\nproceed from Nagasaki to Kagoshima and Uwajima, and call in at Hiôgo on\r\nmy way back. I embarked, therefore, on the 1st January 1867 in the\r\n\"Argus,\" Commander Round, with my two servants, Noguchi Tomizô and Yasu.\r\nThe former was a young _samurai_ of Aidzu, who had left his home and\r\nattached himself to Vyse, our consul at Hakodaté, in order to study\r\nEnglish. In the autumn of 1865 he came to live with me, to carry on his\r\nstudies, and on the present occasion he had accompanied me to Nagasaki,\r\nwhence he was to have gone to England as cabin-servant to Alexander\r\nBuller, the Commander of the flagship. But whether it was the tossing\r\nabout on the way down, or the disagreeable servant's position, he now\r\nchanged his mind, and begged me to take him back to Yedo. Buller\r\nexpressed himself as somewhat annoyed, but I could not help it. Noguchi\r\neventually went with me in 1869 to England, where I paid for his\r\nschooling during a couple of years. After my return to Japan he stayed\r\non awhile in London at the expense of the Japanese government, and\r\neventually came back to Tôkiô, where he obtained a minor appointment in\r\na public office. In spite of his then comparatively elevated position,\r\nhe never gave himself airs, or forgot that I had befriended him, and it\r\nwas with great regret that I heard of his death about the beginning of\r\n1885. He was honest and faithful to the end. Yasu was a young monkey\r\nbelonging to the lower classes, and I don't remember that he had any\r\nvirtues.\r\n\r\nRound did not treat me very well, and made me sleep in the cockpit, a\r\nsort of common den in the bottom of the ship, where the midshipmen keep\r\ntheir chests and sling their hammocks. There was no privacy, and we were\r\ncrowded together in a most uncomfortable manner. I got a cot to sleep\r\nin, but no mattress or pillow, and was forced to borrow a cushion off a\r\nbunk in the captain's cabin and roll up my greatcoat for a pillow.\r\n\r\nWe reached Kagoshima next day early in the afternoon. As soon as we\r\ndropped our anchor, some officers pulled off from the shore, bringing a\r\nflag for us to hoist while firing the salute in answer to theirs.\r\nMatsuoka Jiûdaiyu came on board to explain that the prince and his\r\nfather were in retirement owing to the recent death of the latter's\r\nmother. As neither was able to receive visitors, the duty of receiving\r\nthe Admiral's letter, of which we were the bearers, would be performed\r\nby the prince's second brother and two councillors. This was a letter\r\nthanking him for kindness shown to shipwrecked sailors. Sir Harry and\r\nthe Admiral on their visit in the previous summer had seen and conversed\r\nwith both the prince and his father Shimadzu Saburô, but I do not\r\nsuppose that my being unable to meet them made much difference to the\r\nresult of my visit, as the conduct of affairs was to a great extent in\r\nthe hands of the principal retainers. I went ashore to stay at the\r\nfactory with three Englishmen named Sutcliffe, Harrison and\r\nShillingford. The last of these, an engineer by profession, had been\r\nengaged by the _daimiô_ in connection with some cotton mills which he\r\nwas erecting, the other two had come to Kagoshima in search of\r\nemployment.\r\n\r\nOn the 3rd, Round came on shore with a party of officers to deliver the\r\nAdmiral's letter, and I accompanied him to interpret. We were met at the\r\nlanding-place by some high officials, who conducted us through the town\r\nfor half a mile to the house, where we were received by Shimadzu Dzusho,\r\na handsome youth, the second son of Shimadzu Saburô, Niiro Giôbu, a\r\ncouncillor who had been in England, and Shimadzu Isé, also a councillor.\r\nIt was a house set apart for the reception of visitors. The prince's\r\nbrother, 29 years years of age, seemed a perfect child as far as\r\nintelligence went. All the talking was done by the high officials who\r\nsat on his right hand. I interpreted the contents of the letter, which\r\nwas then handed to Shimadzu Dzusho, the whole ceremony not occupying\r\nmore than five minutes. We then sat down to an entertainment, which\r\nopened with a few courses of Japanese cookery with _saké_, but consisted\r\nin the main of an interminable succession of European dishes, moistened\r\nwith sherry, champagne and brandy. I took my revenge upon Round by\r\nkeeping up a lively conversation in Japanese, and translating none of\r\nit, so the poor man was driven to count the oranges in a dish which\r\nstood near, in order to keep off ennui. After the banquet, the officers\r\ndispersed themselves through the town, while I remained behind to assist\r\nin making a translation of the Admiral's letter. Niiro also stopped. We\r\ntalked about the proposed meeting of _daimiôs_, which had been postponed\r\n_sine die_. Then I praised the composition of a letter which had been\r\naddressed to the Mikado in the name of the Prince of Satsuma some months\r\nback.\r\n\r\n\"Did you see it? What a stupid document it was,\" said Niiro.\r\n\r\n\"Not at all,\" I replied. \"I thought it excellent, and the style was\r\nworthy of all praise.\"\r\n\r\n\"Had it not reference to Hiôgo?\"\r\n\r\n\"No. I mean the memorial objecting to sending Satsuma troops to\r\nco-operate with those of the Tycoon against Chôshiû.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, yes. Shimadzu Isé, who sat next to me to-day, was the writer of\r\nthat letter. He was in Kiôto at the time.\"\r\n\r\n\"How is the Chôshiû business getting on,\" I asked. \"I hear the Tycoon\r\nhas withdrawn the greater part of his troops.\"\r\n\r\n\"Chôshiû is very strong,\" he replied, \"and he has right on his side.\r\nNone of the _daimiôs_ will support the Tycoon, and the latter has now no\r\nchance of beating him.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, I think that if he had put his best troops into the field, and\r\nattacked Chôshiû energetically at first, he must have conquered him.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, never. He had not right on his side.\"\r\n\r\n\"You appear to be very friendly with Chôshiû,\" I remarked.\r\n\r\n\"No,\" said he, \"not friendly, but we have a natural fellow-feeling for\r\none of our own class.\"\r\n\r\nNiiro's reference to the letter of the Prince of Satsuma, which he\r\nsupposed I had seen, revealed the important fact that the Satsuma clan\r\nwere opposed to the opening of Hiôgo, and in fact it was the\r\npresentation of this letter or memorial to the Mikado during the visit\r\nof the foreign representatives in November 1865 which had encouraged the\r\nMikado to make it a condition of giving his sanction to the treaties\r\nthat the Tycoon should arrange for that port being given up. It was\r\nnecessary, therefore, to impress on Niiro's mind, for the benefit of his\r\nfellow clansmen, that the foreign Powers would not for a moment\r\nentertain the idea of giving up Hiôgo or any other part of the treaties.\r\n\r\nAt this moment there was lying in the bay a little steamer named the\r\n\"Otentosama,\" belonging to Chôshiû. She had brought down the leading man\r\nof that clan, Katsura Kogorô, afterwards known during the year of the\r\nrevolution as Kido Junichirô. I said to Niiro that I should like to call\r\non him to inquire after some of my Shimonoséki friends. Niiro replied\r\nthat Katsura was to have an interview with Shimadzu Saburô at ten\r\no'clock the same evening, and a meeting afterwards with some of the\r\nSatsuma councillors at three in the morning. If I wished particularly to\r\nsee him, I might go and sleep at his lodgings, and wait till he turned\r\nup. I declined the invitation, preferring a European bed, for at that\r\ntime I was not so accustomed to Japanese ways as I afterwards became. It\r\nwas weak on my part. But what Niiro said rendered it perfectly clear\r\nthat an understanding was being negotiated between the two most powerful\r\nof the western clans, and that they would henceforth be united against\r\nthe Tycoon. Fortunate for us that they were on friendly terms with us,\r\nand fortunate also for the general interest of foreign Powers, between\r\nwhom and the revolutionary government of 1868 the British Legation acted\r\nas mediators. The French Legation on the other hand supported the\r\nTycoon. M. Roches was projecting the foundation of the arsenal at\r\nYokosuka, which would place the military organization of the Tokugawa\r\nfamily on a new and superior footing, and he had procured a\r\ndistinguished staff of French officers to drill the Tycoon's troops. It\r\nwas even rumoured that he had made, or was contemplating making, offers\r\nof material assistance to Shitotsubashi. And this policy he pursued\r\nuntil the logic of facts at last demonstrated its folly, being followed\r\nby the North German Chargé d' Affaires, Herr von Brandt, and the Italian\r\nMinister, Count La Tour. The Netherlands Political Agent, however,\r\nadhered to Sir Harry, while the new American Minister, General van\r\nValkenburg, was neutral.\r\n\r\nWe had felt the pulse of the Japanese people more carefully and\r\ndiagnosed the political condition better than our rivals, so that the\r\nprestige of the British Minister in the years 1868 and 1869 was\r\ncompletely in the ascendant.\r\n\r\nOn the 4th January the prince's reply was to have been delivered on\r\nboard the \"Argus,\" but at noon Niiro presented himself to say that it\r\nwas not yet ready. We therefore landed and inspected the glass factory,\r\nshot and shell foundry, gun foundry and pot and kettle foundry near the\r\nprince's garden at Iso. The letter now arrived in charge of Matsuoka,\r\nand after its formal delivery, we sat down once more to a banquet in\r\nEuropean style. It was shorter than that of the previous day, and the\r\ndishes better cooked, but it was politeness rather than gastronomic\r\nsatisfaction that caused us to praise it. For in truth the dinner was\r\nbad and ill-arranged.\r\n\r\nAbout five o'clock I started off with Sutcliffe to call on Niiro, who\r\nhad not been seen since the morning. After an hour's walking, we arrived\r\nat his house, darkness having already set in. Niiro received us very\r\ncordially, and entertained us with tea, oranges, beer, cakes and\r\nconversation for an hour and a half. He told me that in passing through\r\nHiôgo lately he had heard that the French Minister was shortly expected\r\nthere with a letter from the Emperor Napoleon III, and that there was to\r\nbe a general gathering of foreign representatives. Shitotsubashi had\r\ndisappointed his friends by accepting the succession to the headship of\r\nthe Tokugawa family, and was suspected of wishing to establish his power\r\nas Tycoon with the aid of foreigners.\r\n\r\nHe gave me to understand that they regarded the French with dislike and\r\ndistrust, and seemed to be all the more friendly with us because they\r\nhad learnt to appreciate the value of our enmity. The Satsuma people\r\nseemed to be making great progress in the civilized arts, and gave me\r\nthe impression of great courage and straightforwardness. I thought they\r\nwould soon be far ahead of the rest of Japan.\r\n\r\nTycoon, as I have said before, was the title given in the treaties to\r\nthe temporal sovereign. The Japanese, however, never used it. Sei-i-tai\r\nShôgun, or \"Generalissimo for the subjugation of barbarians,\" was his\r\nofficial designation, which delicacy prevented his ministers from\r\nemploying in their official communications with the foreign\r\nrepresentatives, while the common people spoke of him as _Kubô sama_.\r\nThe \"opposition\" _daimiôs_, however, had adopted the term _Baku-fu_,\r\nwhich most closely might be rendered by \"military establishment,\" and it\r\nwas this term that my friends and I used in conversation. In like\r\nmanner, for the honorific designation _Gorôjiû_ (noble old men) applied\r\nin the east of Japan to the Tycoon's council of ministers, the\r\nexpression _Kaku-rô_ (old ones) was substituted. The opposition refused\r\nto recognize that the government which they wished to upset was entitled\r\nto any mark of respect.\r\n\r\nOn the 5th January we left Kagoshima and anchored in Uwajima Bay at\r\neleven o'clock on the following day.\r\n\r\nThe beautiful bay is completely landlocked, and surrounded by hills of\r\nvarying height up to 2000 feet. Close behind the town, on its east side,\r\nrises a high peak known as Oni-ga-jô, the \"demon's castle.\" The prince's\r\nfortress was a conspicuous object to the right of the town; it stood on\r\na low, wooded hill, close to the seashore, and consisted of a\r\nthree-storied keep, surrounded by a double wall of stonework surmounted\r\nby white plastered walls, almost hidden by the trees. South of this lay\r\nthe official quarter, the citizens' quarter being to the east and north,\r\nstretching for some distance along the shore, as the hills behind leave\r\nthe town no room to expand. Close in shore the water is very shallow,\r\nand advantage had been taken of this to construct salterns and reclaim\r\nrice fields by building a dyke. There was a small battery on each side\r\nof the bay, more for show than for defensive use.\r\n\r\nAbout an hour and a half after we anchored, a boat was noticed hovering\r\nabout the stern, with a person in the stern-sheets busily engaged in\r\nexamining the ship through an opera glass. Finding out that it was the\r\nprince, Commander Round sent a gig at once to invite him on board. He\r\nexplained his curious behaviour by saying that he had wished to remain\r\n_incognito._ The Admiral's letter wishing him a happy new year was\r\nproduced, and after I had translated its contents, he took possession of\r\nit. He was aged 32, of about middle height, and had an aristocratic cast\r\nof countenance, with a slightly aquiline nose, on the whole a handsome\r\nman. As a matter of course he was shown over the ship. In the meantime I\r\nhad some conversation with a gentleman-like young man of about twenty\r\nyears of age named Matsuné Kura, son of the principal _karô_. He said\r\nthat Satsuma and Uwajima were on very friendly terms, which was natural,\r\nas the ex-_daimiô_ and Shimadzu Saburô had been amongst the little band\r\nof princes who were disgraced for their opposition to the elevation of\r\nthe lately deceased Tycoon. Shitotsubashi had not been appointed Shôgun,\r\nand perhaps never would be.\r\n\r\nWhen the prince returned on shore I accompanied him in the gig, and\r\nfound a number of his women waiting for him on the bank with his\r\nchildren, the eldest of whom was a little boy of seven years of age. The\r\nothers were mostly babies in arms, and each was attended by an\r\nundernurse bearing a small sword wrapped in gold brocade. The Japanese\r\n_samurai_ was accustomed to the companionship of his weapon from his\r\nvery infancy. The prince was extremely affable, and promised to repeat\r\nhis visit on the following day, and to bring the _in-kio_ or _ex-daimiô_\r\nwith him. I said good-bye, and went into the town, where I met three\r\nofficers from the ship engaged in \"curio\" hunting. An immense crowd\r\nfollowed us everywhere, examining our clothes and asking all manner of\r\nquestions, but behaving with the utmost civility. I felt my heart warm\r\nmore and more to the Japanese.\r\n\r\nOn the 7th January it rained violently and blew hard all day, but the\r\nweather did not prevent the _daimiô_ and the _in-kio_ from coming on\r\nboard. The latter was a tall man with strongly marked features and a big\r\nnose, and reputed to be one of the most intelligent of his class,\r\nimperious in manner, and 49 years of age. He was not a born _Daté_ (that\r\nwas the surname of the Uwajima _daimiôs_), but had been adopted from a\r\n_hatamoto_ family in Yedo. After his adoption the present _daimiô_ was\r\nborn, and the relationship between them was that of brothers by\r\nadoption. But still the adopted son could not be set aside, and he\r\neventually succeeded to the title and fief, but by way of compensation\r\nto the younger brother who had lost his birthright, he adopted him as\r\nhis son. Consequently, when the prince was disgraced in 1858 the real\r\nheir succeeded. _In-kio_ (living retired) is a common term for the head\r\nof a family, whether noble or commoner, who has given up the active\r\nheadship and the management of the estate to his son, a not unusual\r\nthing in \"Old Japan\" for a father who had reached the sixties. Here the\r\n_in-kio_ was manifestly the ruling spirit, and it was touching to\r\nobserve the immense respect paid to him by the titular prince, who\r\nalways addressed him as father, while he on his part used the\r\ndepreciatory term _sengaré_ (my youngster) in speaking of the _daimiô_.\r\nThey stopped for a couple of hours talking and drinking some Moselle\r\nwith which I had provided myself at Nagasaki.\r\n\r\nThe _in-kio_ began to talk eagerly to me about the very suspicious\r\nintimacy that existed between the Tycoon's government (_baku-fu_) and\r\nthe French Legation, but as soon as old Matsuné, the principal\r\ncouncillor, perceived that his master was becoming indiscreet, he\r\nhurried him away on the pretext that it would be too late to fire the\r\nsalute. So away they went, amid the thunder of seventeen guns, which was\r\nreturned from one of the batteries. After he left the wives and families\r\nof the two princes flocked on board. They were not in the least afraid\r\nof us, and conversed with as much ease and readiness as European ladies.\r\nThere was a Japanese officer on board, afterwards Admiral Hayashi Kenzô.\r\n\r\nNoguchi, who had been ashore to have a hot bath and get shaved, had\r\nbrought me an invitation to dine with Iriyé, the captain of the battery.\r\nSo I took a boat and went off in spite of the wind and rain. My host had\r\nnot yet returned from his duties, but his wife asked me to come in, and\r\nin about a quarter of an hour he made his appearance. Soon afterwards\r\nanother artillery officer named Mori came in, and then two more juniors.\r\nDinner was at once ordered. It consisted of innumerable courses of fish\r\nand soup, and lasted from six o'clock till eleven. We talked, drank hot\r\n_saké_, and sang by turns, and I had to answer a multitude of questions\r\non all possible subjects. This gave me numerous opportunities of\r\nuttering appropriate wise saws and proverbial sayings, which gave my\r\nhearers unbounded delight, and inspired them with no small amount of\r\nrespect for the philosophy of the western peoples. At half-past eleven\r\nthe last guest retired, and after we had eaten a little rice, we went to\r\nbed in Japanese fashion. I was surprised to find that one could sleep\r\ncomfortably without sheets.\r\n\r\nOn the following morning, after a good breakfast _à la Japonaise_, I\r\nrejoined the ship, and started in company with Round, and Wright and\r\nDunn of the ixth regiment, who as I have hitherto neglected to mention,\r\nhad come on board at Nagasaki, for the rifle range, in accordance with\r\nan engagement made on the previous day. A guard of honour of 25 men\r\nreceived us at the landing-place, and we were escorted by an officer of\r\nthe Uwajima navy. Half-way we found another guard, which fell in and\r\nled us up a pretty stiff hill to the ranges. Some of our small-arms men\r\nwere landed to exhibit their skill. We had to walk a short distance and\r\nclimb the hills. There is not sufficient flat ground in Uwajima for a\r\nproper rifle range, so the butts were placed on the side of another hill\r\nseparated from us by a valley about 700 yards wide. Here we found tents\r\nset us, and the _in-kio_, his own son, and the prince awaiting our\r\narrival. Our men, who were not accustomed to shooting across a chasm of\r\nunknown depth and width, showed themselves less skilful than the Uwajima\r\nmarksmen, who had the advantage of knowing their ground.\r\n\r\nWe got the shooting over by half-past one, and the whole party then\r\nproceeded to the _goten_ or palace, which was outside the castle. It was\r\nan old building, dating from about 500 years back, but without\r\npretensions to architectural style. We were not received at the great\r\nentrance, but at some temporary steps erected for the occasion which led\r\nup at once from the garden into the verandah. Here old Matsuné met us\r\nand conducted us into a long room, which was shut off on all sides by\r\nhandsome folding screens covered with gold leaf. At one end of the room\r\nwas a particularly large screen, which the prince said was a present to\r\nhis ancestor from the great Taikô-sama. A table was placed down the\r\nmiddle of the room, with armchairs on the right side for the _in-kio_,\r\nthe prince, and Matsuné, while on the left were seated Round and his\r\nofficers. I sat at the head of the table to facilitate conversation.\r\n\r\nThe dinner was beautifully got up, every separate dish prettily arranged\r\nand decorated, but the most tasteful of all was a wild duck with all its\r\nplumage perfect, and the roasted meat cut up small and laid on the back\r\nbetween the wings, elevated in such a way as to convey the idea that the\r\nbird was swimming and flying at the same time. Other dishes consisted of\r\nhuge crayfish, and there was a large baked tai, as required by\r\netiquette, for each person. Each of us had a large porcelain cup to\r\ndrink from, and the warm liquor was handed round in pewter vessels with\r\nlong spouts, like flat teapots. The ex-prince exchanged cups with Round,\r\nmyself, and the two redcoats in turn, and the same ceremony was aftwards\r\ngone through with the prince and his minister, old Matsuné.\r\n\r\nThere was a good deal of eating and saké drinking, and the _in-kio_\r\npresented me with a large shallow cup of red lacquer which I had first\r\nto empty. My companions left early, while at the _in-kio's_ request I\r\nremained behind for some conversation on politics. He began by speaking\r\nof Hiôgo, as to which he had expressed his opinion to Sir Harry Parkes\r\nin July last. But he was now in favour of opening the place to foreign\r\ntrade, and so was Shitotsubashi. He had heard that negotiations were\r\nproceeding with the French for its being opened next September, but he\r\nwould prefer that the arrangements should be made with us rather than\r\nwith the French, whom he did not like. I replied that I believed the\r\nFrench policy was based upon the belief that the country needed a\r\nrecognized head, and that as they had a treaty with the Shôgun, who\r\napparently was the most powerful political personage, they thought it\r\nwould be better to strengthen him as far as possible. The English policy\r\nwas different. We regarded our treaty as having been made with Japan,\r\nand not with the Shôgun in particular. If with the latter, then as there\r\nwas no actual Shôgun at the moment, our treaty would have to be regarded\r\nas being in abeyance. We did not wish to interfere, and were quite\r\ncontent that the Japanese should settle their internal disputes among\r\nthemselves.\r\n\r\n\"But,\" said _In-kio_, \"if civil war becomes chronic, your trade will\r\nsuffer, and you will have to put an end to it for your own sakes.\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" I replied, \"for if we interfered and took a side, matters would\r\nbecome ten times more difficult, and the foreign trade would come\r\naltogether to an end.\"\r\n\r\nThe _in-kio_ then remarked that his idea was for Japan to become a\r\nconfederated empire, with the Mikado for its head, and that this idea\r\nwas favoured by Satsuma and Chôshiû. I said I thought there was no other\r\nway out of the difficulty, and I had written an article in a Yokohama\r\nnewspaper to that effect. \"Oh,\" said the _in-kio_, \"I have read it,\"\r\nmeaning the translation which has been already mentioned. At last the\r\nex-prince said, \"Let us send for the women and have some music. The\r\ncaptain will be jealous if he hears that I produced them to you after he\r\nhad left, so don't tell him, but if he hears of it, you may say I was\r\ndrunk.\"\r\n\r\nHere the conversation was interrupted by the entrance of the ladies of\r\nthe harem, such a bevy of pretty women, some wives and some not. All the\r\nchildren came in too. I had to drink _saké_ with all of the ladies, till\r\nI began to fear my head might give way. Musical instruments were brought\r\nin, and a great deal of _saké_ was drunk, greatly to the increase of\r\nfriendliness and conviviality, but not to the advantage of the\r\ninterchange of political views. In fact the _in-kio_ gave himself up to\r\nenjoyment and would talk no more. He afterwards said in a casual sort of\r\nway: \"You must not let it appear in the newspapers that I went on board\r\nthe \"Argus,\" for I have declined attending the meeting at Kiôto on the\r\nground of sickness, and I should not wish the government to hear of it.\r\nI should not like to be at Kiôto just now.\" After the music had begun, I\r\nlooked round and saw one of the officers of the \"Argus,\" who had come in\r\nafter the captain's departure, performing a Japanese dance. I proposed\r\nto him to dance a hornpipe, which he at once did, and the ex-prince, a\r\nman of the sober age of 49, got up, placed himself opposite, and tried\r\nto imitate the steps, holding up his loose trousers with both hands. The\r\nfun infected two of the ministers, who joined him in a three-handed\r\nreel.\r\n\r\nAfter drinking a great deal of _saké_ with the two princes and their\r\nladies, I was carried off--no, led--to his own house by old Matsuné,\r\nwhere more _saké_ was produced, and I was made acquainted with the rest\r\nof his family. After about an hour's conversation, I was glad to get to\r\nbed, for the fumes of the hot _saké_ were beginning to have some effect\r\non my head. Hayashi, young Matsuné, another Japanese and myself, slept\r\nin one room. Next morning I was roused before daylight by the report of\r\na signal gun fired from the \"Argus\" to announce that she was ready to\r\nleave. I dressed hastily and went on board with young Matsuné, to whom I\r\npresented my opera glass as a souvenir. Noguchi and my boy Yasu, who had\r\nalso been sleeping on shore, had not yet made their appearance, but\r\nRound refused to wait for them. So I begged Matsuné to send them somehow\r\nto Yokohama, and advance them any money which they might ask for, to be\r\nrepaid to the Uwajima agent in Yedo. At half-past six we weighed anchor,\r\nand steamed out of the bay, full of regrets at being obliged to part\r\nfrom our kind, hospitable friends.\r\n\r\nWe reached Hiôgo about noon on the 11th of January, after visiting one\r\nor two unimportant places in the inland sea. I went on shore to inquire\r\nwhether we could get coals, beef and vegetables. After arranging with\r\nthe local officials to send some supplies on board, I walked about the\r\ntown, and found the people quite accustomed to the sight of a foreigner.\r\nI met some two-sworded men, who protested that they were determined to\r\nprevent the opening of Hiôgo to foreign trade, but they were evidently\r\njoking. A Hizen man whom I came across declared that I was an old\r\nacquaintance, though I had never set eyes on him before. Afterwards\r\nHayashi Kenzô and I went on board a Satsuma steamer that was lying in\r\nport, and made the acquaintance of her captain, Inouyé Shinzayemon. She\r\nhad brought up from Kagoshima one of the leading Satsuma men named\r\nKomatsu Tatéwaki; he had gone up to Ozaka to meet Saigô, the greatest of\r\nall the Satsuma leaders. I immediately proposed to go up to Ozaka and\r\nsee them, and letters were written by Inouyé and Hayashi to Godai\r\nSaisuké (our captive of 1863 at Kagoshima) to make the necessary\r\narrangements. Next day, however, I heard that Saigô was himself probably\r\ncoming to Hiôgo, and in the meantime Hayashi took me ashore to have a\r\nhot bath and some luncheon _à la Japonaise_.\r\n\r\nHere for the first time I learnt how to put on a cotton gown (_yukata_)\r\nafter the bath, and enjoy the sensation of gradually cooling down. We\r\nhad just sat down to eat when it was announced that Saigô had arrived,\r\nand hastily swallowing our rice, we sallied forth to the other\r\nhouse-of-call of the Satsuma men. Saigô, as I had all along suspected,\r\nturned out to be identical with the man introduced to me as Shimadzu\r\nSachiû in November 1865, and he laughed heartily when I reminded him of\r\nhis alias. After exchanging the usual compliments, I began to feel\r\nrather at a loss, the man looked so stolid, and would not make\r\nconversation. But he had an eye that sparkled like a big black diamond,\r\nand his smile when he spoke was so friendly. I began about the\r\nemployment of foreigners in Satsuma and the difficulties which might,\r\nunder certain circumstances, arise from the residence of British\r\nsubjects outside the treaty limits and beyond the jurisdiction of the\r\nconsular authorities. But this did not produce much in the way of\r\nresponse. So I bethought myself of another subject which was more likely\r\nto draw him, and inquired if Shitotsubashi had not lately received in\r\nperson a letter addressed to him by the Emperor of the French. He\r\nreplied \"Yes.\" A short time ago he memorialized the Mikado to the effect\r\nthat there was a letter from the French Emperor addressed to the Shôgun,\r\nthe reception of which had been delayed owing to the late Tycoon's\r\ndetention at Kiôto in connexion with the expedition against Chôshiû;\r\nthat he now intended to summon all the foreign representatives to Ozaka,\r\nand would profit by the occasion to receive the letter in question.\r\nShitotsubashi would accordingly come down to Ozaka on the 17th of the\r\nJapanese month (22nd January), and expected the representatives to\r\narrive shortly afterwards. We (the Satsuma people) sent up a copy of the\r\nmemorial to Sir Harry Parkes by the hands of Yoshii Kôsuké, but he had\r\nreplied that he was uncertain whether he would accept the Tycoon's\r\ninvitation, not having yet heard anything direct about the matter.\r\n\r\n\"But,\" I asked, \"how can Shitotsubashi receive a letter addressed to the\r\nShôgun. He is not Shôgun, is he?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes; he received his commission the day before yesterday.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" I replied, \"that is very unexpected. I thought he had to settle\r\nChôshiû's affair first. But his influence must have increased immensely\r\nfor him to have been able to manage this.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, indeed\"--(emphatically)--\"A man who was yesterday no better than a\r\nbeggarly _rônin daimiô_ is to-day _Sei-i-tai-shôgun_.\"\r\n\r\n\"Who,\" I asked, \"contrived it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Itakura Suwô no Kami\" (a newly appointed member of the council).\r\n\"Shitotsubashi is in great favour now with the Mikado, and he could\r\nbecome _Kwambaku_ (grand vizier) if he chose. He has made his brother\r\nMimbutayu, a younger scion of the Mito house, head of the Shimidzu\r\nfamily, which had become extinct, and he is going to send him as\r\nambassador to France.\"\r\n\r\n\"On what business?\"\r\n\r\n\"We have not the least idea.\"\r\n\r\n\"And for what is Shitotsubashi going to summon the foreign\r\nrepresentatives to Ozaka?\"\r\n\r\n\"We have not the slightest idea of that either,\" said Saigô.\r\n\r\n\"How odd that he should be able to do these things without consulting\r\nthe _daimiôs_.\"\r\n\r\n\"The _daimiôs_ ought to have been consulted, as we expected they would\r\nbe henceforth on all political matters. The _Baku-fu_ have got on so\r\nbadly of late years that my prince is of opinion that they should not be\r\nleft to ruin the country as they please. And when certain of the\r\n_daimiôs_ were summoned by the Mikado to Kiôto, they expected to have a\r\nshare in the government. Now they perceive that such is not the\r\nintention of the _Baku-fu_, and they don't intend to be made fools of.\r\nSo they have one and all refused to attend. Echizen stopped there as\r\nlong as he could, but went away at last.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then everything is over for the present?\" I said.\r\n\r\n\"Well, we shall be able to find him out in the next three years, I\r\nsuppose.\"\r\n\r\n\"Three years is a long time. But this council at Kiôto, was it not\r\nconnected with the latter part of the decree giving power to the Shôgun\r\nto conclude treaties, where the Mikado says, 'There are points in the\r\nexisting treaties which I wish you to rectify in concert with the\r\n_daimiôs_?'\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh no!\" said Saigô, \"you are quite wrong there. It was intended, as I\r\nhave said before, that the _daimiôs_ should consult with the _Baku-fu_\r\nabout government reforms.\"\r\n\r\n\"I suppose,\" I said, \"that among other questions for discussion the\r\nChôshiû affair and the opening of Hiôgo were included. What is the\r\nposition with regard to Chôshiû? We foreigners cannot comprehend it?\"\r\n\r\n\"It is indeed incomprehensible,\" Saigô replied. \"The _Baku-fu_ commenced\r\nthe war without justification, and they have stopped it equally without\r\nreason.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is it peace, or what?\"\r\n\r\n\"No. Simply that hostilities have ceased, and the troops have been\r\nwithdrawn. There the matter rests.\"\r\n\r\n\"For us foreigners it is a great puzzle why the _Baku-fu_ attacked\r\nChôshiû at all. It was certainly not because he had fired on foreign\r\nships. If he really had offended the Mikado, surely your prince, with\r\nhis profound affection for the 'Son of Heaven,' could have lent\r\nassistance.\"\r\n\r\n\"I believe the _Baku-fu_ hated Chôshiû all along,\" replied Saigô.\r\n\r\n\"It is a great pity the council did not take place, because it is of the\r\nhighest importance that the affairs of the country should come to a\r\nsettlement within this year. We have a treaty with Japan, not with any\r\nparticular person, and we don't intend to interfere with you in the\r\nsettlement of your domestic disputes. Whether Japan is governed by the\r\nMikado or the _Baku-fu_, or becomes a confederation of separate states\r\nis a matter of indifference to us, but we want to know who is the real\r\nhead. I confess to you that we have serious doubts about the _Baku-fu_.\r\nWe saw that they are not supreme, or rather not omnipotent when they\r\nasked us to let them off the opening of Hiôgo. Then the murder of\r\nRichardson and the impotence of the _Baku-fu_ to punish his murderers\r\nshowed us that their authority did not extend as far as Satsuma. Then\r\nwhen ships-of-war belonging to friendly nations were fired on by\r\nChôshiû, we had to go and punish him because the _Baku-fu_ could not do\r\nit. And we see now that Chôshiû has got the best of the late war. These\r\nthings make us doubt the supremacy of the _Baku-fu_ throughout the\r\ncountry, and we had hoped that the council would settle the difficulty.\r\nThe _Baku-fu_ will again be in a difficult position next year when, as\r\nwe intend to do, we demand the opening of Hiôgo, if the _daimiôs_ oppose\r\nit.\"\r\n\r\n\"My master does not oppose the opening of Hiôgo, but objects to its\r\nbeing opened after the fashion of other ports. We want it to be opened\r\nso as to be a benefit to Japan, and not solely for the private advantage\r\nof the _Baku-fu_.\"\r\n\r\n\"But how would you have it opened?\" I asked.\r\n\r\n\"By placing all questions regarding Hiôgo in the hands of a committee of\r\nfive or six _daimiôs_, who would be able to prevent the _Baku-fu_ from\r\nacting exclusively for its own selfish interests. Hiôgo is very\r\nimportant to us. We all owe money to the Ozaka merchants, and we have to\r\nsend the productions of our provinces to them every year in payment of\r\nour debts. Our affairs will be much thrown out of order if the place is\r\nopened on the same plan as Yokohama.\"\r\n\r\n\"I see now why you attach so much importance to Hiôgo. It is your last\r\ncard. It is a great pity you cannot settle all your internal\r\ndifficulties before the port is opened.\"\r\n\r\n\"When we sent Yoshii up to see Sir Harry Parkes, he told him if he came\r\nto Ozaka to ask for us. We could not go to call on him for fear of\r\nincurring suspicion. And Sir Harry replied that he would ask not only to\r\nsee the Prince of Satsuma, but all the other _daimiôs_ as well.\"\r\n\r\n_Saké_ and _sakana_ (_i.e._ its accompaniments) were now introduced, and\r\nwe were waited on by a good-looking girl who was said to be a sweetheart\r\nof Godai's. Saigô excused himself and retired for a few moments with my\r\ncompanion Hayashi, who was apparently a confidential agent of the\r\nSatsuma people. After the second course, as he seemed in a hurry to get\r\naway, I rose to go, but he would not hear of my leaving so early. I\r\nbegged him not to stand on ceremony, but to leave whenever he chose, as\r\nI knew he had a long way to go. After a few minutes more, he rose, and\r\nsaying, \"In case Sir Harry wants to communicate anything to us, he has\r\nonly to send a message to our house at Yedo, and we will despatch anyone\r\nhe likes from Kiôto to see him,\" he took his departure. I thanked him\r\nvery warmly for coming so far to see me, and we bade each other\r\nfarewell. The feast was resumed, and after numerous courses, Hayashi and\r\nI went back on board the \"Argus\" by half-past seven. Next day we left\r\nfor Yokohama. During our stay at Hiôgo we had walked freely about the\r\ntown, and found the people perfectly civil. They were evidently becoming\r\naccustomed to the sight of foreigners, and scarcely took any notice of\r\nus as we passed through the streets.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: CHOSHIU COUNCILLORS\r\n    Katsura Kogorû and Kikkawa Kemmotsu]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: DAIMIÔ OF CHÔ-SHIU AND HIS HEIR\r\n    Môri Daizen and Môri Nagato]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XVI\r\n\r\n                          FIRST VISIT TO OZAKA\r\n\r\n\r\nON reaching Yokohama on the 15th January 1867, I duly made my report to\r\nthe chief of all I had seen, heard, and said, and took up my quarters on\r\nthe following day at Yedo. The first news I learnt was that the Shôgun\r\nhad invited all the foreign representatives to meet him at Ozaka, and\r\nthat they would probably accept. His object, it was explained, was to\r\nbreak through all the traditions of the past eight years and to make the\r\ntreaties of friendship which had been concluded by Japan with foreign\r\ncountries more of a reality than they had hitherto been. But Sir Harry,\r\nwho had now learnt enough of the internal political condition to\r\nconvince him that the Shôgun's power was fast decaying, still hesitated,\r\nand it was only when he found a majority of his colleagues determined to\r\ngo, that he made up his mind to join them. But he persuaded them that it\r\nwould be well to have inquiries made beforehand as to the kind of\r\naccommodation that would be provided, and consequently deputed Mitford\r\nand myself to proceed thither in the \"Argus.\" We were joined by Captain\r\nCardew of the 2/ix, and reached Hiôgo on the 9th of February, after a\r\ntwo days' run. A couple of subordinate officials of the Shôgun's foreign\r\ndepartment had accompanied us to make the necessary arrangements, and\r\nwere landed at once to provide for our going to Ozaka without loss of\r\ntime. We determined to go by land. The \"Princess Royal,\" \"Basilisk,\"\r\n\"Serpent,\" and \"Firm\" were in port, having just arrived from visiting\r\nthe Princes of Chikuzen at Fukuoka, and the Princes of Chôshiû at\r\nMitajiri. Lord Walter Kerr of the \"Princess Royal\" kindly gave me\r\nphotographs of the four nobles and of two of the leading councillors of\r\nChôshiû, which are here reproduced. Among them will be recognized\r\nKatsura Kogorô, already mentioned. On board the \"Princess Royal\" I met\r\nsome native traders, who were greatly interested in the approaching\r\nopening of the port, and discussed various suitable sites for a foreign\r\nsettlement. They also conveyed to me the news of the Mikado's death,\r\nwhich had only just been made public. Rumour attributed his decease to\r\nsmallpox, but several years afterwards I was assured by a Japanese well\r\nacquainted with what went on behind the scenes that he had been\r\npoisoned. He was by conviction utterly opposed to any concessions to\r\nforeigners, and had therefore been removed out of the way by those who\r\nforesaw that the coming downfall of the _Baku-fu_ would force the court\r\ninto direct relations with Western Powers. But with a reactionary Mikado\r\nnothing but difficulties, resulting probably in war, was to be expected.\r\nIt is common enough in eastern countries to attribute the deaths of\r\nimportant personages to poison, and in the case of the last preceding\r\nShôgun rumours had been pretty rife that he had been made away with by\r\nShitotsubashi. In connexion with the Mikado I certainly never heard any\r\nsuch suggestion at the time. But it is impossible to deny that his\r\ndisappearance from the political scene, leaving as his successor a boy\r\nof fifteen or sixteen years of age, was most opportune.\r\n\r\nNoguchi and my boy Yasu turned up here, having been forwarded from\r\nUwajima. They were full of excuses, which were readily admitted.\r\n\r\nWe got away on the morning of the 11th, and Lieutenant Thalbitzer, a\r\nDanish officer from the \"Argus,\" having joined us, we were a party of\r\nfour. Ponies had been provided by the Japanese authorities, and we had\r\nan escort of nine men armed with swords from the corps which supplied\r\nthe guards of the foreign legations at Yedo. Our steeds were small,\r\nill-fed, and untrained, but each had a splendid running footman attached\r\nto it, who kept up the pace in magnificent style. Troops had been posted\r\nalong the road for our protection, and the whole number thus detailed\r\ncannot have been less than 1500. This gave us a novel and somewhat\r\nembarrassing sense of importance. The road is perfectly flat the whole\r\nway, and fairly straight until it approaches Ozaka, when it begins to\r\nmake zig-zags which lengthened it unnecessarily. This plan was formerly\r\nadopted nearly all over Japan in the vicinity of _daimiôs_' towns for\r\nstrategical purposes. As the roads nearly always run through the swampy\r\nrice fields, a hostile force is unable to march straight at its point of\r\nattack, but must follow the road, being thus constantly exposed to a\r\nflank fire from the defending force occupying the other arm of the angle\r\nahead.\r\n\r\nSoon after passing Ama-ga-saki we came in sight of the castle of Ozaka,\r\na conspicuous object in the landscape by its shining white walls and\r\nmany-storied towers, visible for many a league. At last we reached the\r\ncity. Although our guides missed the route at first, and here and there\r\na break occurred in the troops which lined the narrow streets, the crowd\r\nquietly made way for us, and stood in front of the houses without\r\nuttering a sound. At every corner there was an immense concourse, and\r\nthe side-streets were filled with eager, gazing faces as far as the eye\r\ncould reach. We crossed the great wooden bridge over the river which\r\nruns through the city, turned to the left along the embankment, and\r\nbending again to the right proceeded down a long, apparently\r\ninterminable street until we finally reached our lodgings at the\r\nHon-gaku-In monastery. Here we found some officials of the foreign\r\ndepartment, and received calls from a few of the local functionaries.\r\nEverything had been done to make us comfortable, and the locality was\r\nthe best that could have been selected. It was impossible to avoid\r\ncontrasting this generous hospitality with the reluctant, almost\r\nhostile, reception accorded to us on the occasion of our visit in 1865.\r\nThe times had evidently changed since the accession of the new Shôgun,\r\nand the recent death of the Mikado did not appear to have made any\r\ndifference in his plans and intentions for the carrying-out of a\r\nconciliatory policy.\r\n\r\nPreparations had been made by the officials for our accommodation to the\r\nbest of their ability. After washing off the dust of our long ride in a\r\ncomfortable bathroom, we sat down to a dinner served in imitation of\r\nwestern fashion, with French wines, including an excellent bottle of\r\nLarose. Alas, it was the only one. The seats, however, were mere\r\nfour-legged wooden stools, and I suffered a good deal from them during\r\nour stay. Afterwards we inspected the bedrooms. The bedsteads were mere\r\nmakeshifts, but there was a plentiful supply of bedding, consisting of\r\ncotton quilts and stuffed silk coverlets. The toilet service was made up\r\nof two ludicrously small basins and, underneath the toilet table, a huge\r\nwater pot; at the side were a cake of almond soap and a bottle of\r\neau-de-cologne. But what seemed especially unusual was the deference of\r\nmanner and language exhibited by all the officials with whom we came in\r\ncontact. Hitherto I had experienced only familiarity approaching to\r\nrudeness at the hands of government officers.\r\n\r\nOn the following morning we were visited by Suzuki, an official of the\r\nUwajima clan, who came with a message from the resident _Karô_ to beg\r\nthat we would not visit them at their _yashiki_, but at the same time he\r\nmanaged to convey the contrary impression. I sent Noguchi to the Satsuma\r\n_yashiki_ to invite Komatsu to call on us, and to that of Uwajima to\r\nconvey my thanks for the kindness exhibited to my two servants. In the\r\nafternoon we went out for a walk in the Shinsai-bashi Suji, which is the\r\nprincipal street of the city, preceded by a small band of one-sworded\r\nmen, who emitted a cry like a crow--_kau, kau_--to warn the people out\r\nof the way. Dense crowds hovered on our footsteps, eager to catch a\r\nglimpse of the strangers, for no Europeans had been in Ozaka since the\r\nlast Dutch mission from Nagasaki had passed through a few years before.\r\nWe were no less inquisitive, and made a great round, past all the\r\nbooksellers' and mercers' shops, till dark.\r\n\r\nOur next visitor was Yoshii Kôsuké, whom I have already mentioned. He\r\nreminded me that we had met at Hiôgo in the autumn of 1865 on board the\r\nsteamer, when I had also seen Saigô for the first time. Yoshii was a\r\nlittle man, very vivacious and talked with a perfect Satsuma brogue.\r\nEvery day we spent the greater part of our time in sight-seeing, and the\r\nofficials proved obliging in every way. We had only to express a wish\r\nand it was immediately gratified. In a day or two we got Komatsu and\r\nYoshii to tiffin. The former was one of the most charming Japanese I\r\nhave known, a Karô by birth, but unlike most of that class,\r\ndistinguished for his political ability, excellent manners, and a genial\r\ncompanion. He had a fairer complexion than most, but his large mouth\r\nprevented his being good-looking. They partook heartily of pâte de foie\r\ngras and pale ale, and at last became so merry that we feared they might\r\nmake indiscreet revelations in the presence of the Tokugawa servants who\r\ncrowded the house.\r\n\r\nOn the next day Mitford and I returned their visit at the Satsuma\r\n_Kura-yashiki_, or produce agency, near the river bank. Yoshii received\r\nus at the door, and ushered us into a room where we found Komatsu, the\r\nagent and Matsuki Kôwan; the latter was one of the two prisoners taken\r\nby us in 1863, and I had some suspicion that he was not altogether to be\r\ntrusted, as he was reported to have been in the Tycoon's service during\r\nthe interval. So after the exchange of compliments I suggested that we\r\nmight have some more private talk. It was a mistake on my part, however.\r\nMatsuki afterwards changed his name to Terashima Tôzô, or perhaps merely\r\nreassumed it, and held office pretty constantly since the revolution of\r\n1868, chiefly in connexion with foreign affairs. So Komatsu, Yoshii,\r\nMitford and I retired together into an inner room. They told us that the\r\nMikado's death had taken place on the 30th January, though the date\r\nofficially announced was the 3rd February. He had been succeeded by his\r\nson, a youth of fifteen, who, it was thought, had in him the makings of\r\na clever man if properly educated in foreign and domestic politics. But\r\nunfortunately the _Baku-fu_ would not allow him to be approached by any\r\nteachers who could improve his mind. During the new Mikado's youth, the\r\nconduct of public affairs would be carried on in his name by the\r\nKwambaku (best rendered vizier). This officer is chosen from one of five\r\nnoble court families, nominally of course by the Mikado, but in reality\r\nby the Tycoon and principal _daimiôs_. The present Kwambaku was a wise\r\nand good man, but too much disposed to listen to the counsels of the\r\n_Baku-fu_. They thought the new Shôgun's idea in inviting the foreign\r\nrepresentatives to Ozaka was merely a counter move to the invitations\r\nwhich Sir Harry Parkes had accepted from the _daimiôs_ of Satsuma and\r\nUwajima. The Shôgun would probably talk a great deal about drawing\r\ncloser the bonds of friendship, etc., but would avoid treating about the\r\nopening of Hiôgo. The _Baku-fu_ in fact did not wish that event to take\r\nplace, because it would let a flood of light into the minds of the\r\nMikado and the court nobles. Komatsu said he had remonstrated with the\r\n_Baku-fu_ for delaying to hand over the land at Hiôgo and postponing the\r\nnotification of the tariff convention of last June, their answer being\r\nthat they had not yet made up their minds on those subjects. Satsuma, he\r\nsaid, had purchased some land near Kôbé as a site for a _Kura-yashiki_,\r\nof which they would be willing to let us have the greater portion for a\r\nforeign settlement. Satsuma wished to see the place opened to foreign\r\ntrade, but wanted it to be done in a proper manner. Many of the court\r\nnobles were also in favour of the measure; these were men of liberal\r\ntendencies, but not in favour with the _Baku-fu_, who had imprisoned\r\nsome of them; they were not allowed to have access to the Mikado.\r\n\r\nAffairs being in a critical condition, it was probable that the Shôgun\r\nwould stop a long time at Kiôto. Were he to return to Yedo, he would\r\nlose his hold over the Mikado, and Chôshiû might make another dash at\r\nthe palace. None of the _daimiôs_ had proceeded specially to Kiôto for\r\nthe investiture of the Shôgun, the absent ones being represented by\r\ntheir agents. Komatsu begged us to tell Sir Harry that it was not the\r\ndesire of Satsuma and the other _daimiôs_ who acted with him to upset\r\nthe _Baku-fu_, but simply to restrain them from misusing their powers.\r\nThey hoped, however, to see the Mikado restored to his ancient position\r\nas _de facto_ ruler of the country. All the plans and hopes of Satsuma\r\ntended to the benefit of the country, and not to a revolution against\r\nthe Shôgun. If Sir Harry on his arrival would propose to make a treaty\r\nwith the Mikado, the _daimiôs_ would at once give in their adhesion, and\r\nflock to Kiôto in order to take part in carrying out the great scheme.\r\nAll that was necessary was for him to help them to this extent, and they\r\nwould do the rest.\r\n\r\nThe conversation had now lasted so long that we thought it best to break\r\noff, for fear of exciting suspicion, and we returned to the other room,\r\nwhere a capital Japanese luncheon was spread out. To my great surprise\r\nwe were joined by Inouyé Bunda, whom I had not seen since the\r\nbombardment of Shimonoséki. His face was now disfigured by a huge scar,\r\nthe vestige of one of several wounds which he had received in the course\r\nof a party fight down in Chôshiû. He said his people had now got the\r\nsteam up and would like to give the Shôgun another thrashing. He brought\r\na message from the prince to Sir Harry inviting him to visit the\r\nprovince at the earliest opportunity. When Sir Harry last passed through\r\nShimonoséki, he said, the French Minister was there, and that accident\r\nhad prevented an intended interview. The Satsuma people expressed the\r\nhope that Mitford and I would visit Kagoshima as soon as possible.\r\n\r\nWe had a discussion with Shibata Hiûga no Kami, one of the Commissioners\r\nfor Foreign Affairs, about Sir Harry's public entry into Ozaka, and\r\nsettled all the details quietly and amicably. But when we came to the\r\nceremony of presentation to the Shôgun some difficulties cropped up. He\r\nwanted the British Minister to make his bow outside the room in which\r\nthe Shôgun would be, and we could not allow this. Our object was to\r\ninsist on the forms being as like those of European courts as possible.\r\n\r\nNoguchi, as I have said, belonged to the Aidzu clan, which furnished the\r\nbest part of the Shogun's fighting force at Kiôto. I had sent him there\r\nto see his people, and he returned with the news that some were coming\r\ndown to call on me. Accordingly, late in the evening of the 17th, four\r\nof them appeared, named Kajiwara Heima (a _Karô_), Kurazawa Uhei, Yamada\r\nTeisuké and Kawara Zenzayemon, bearing as presents rolls of light blue\r\nsilk damask, and lists of swords and other articles to be hereafter\r\ngiven to Sir Harry, Mitford, and myself. In making official presents the\r\ncustom was that a list written on thick, light cream-coloured paper\r\ncalled _hôsho-gami_ should accompany the articles, and often, if these\r\nwere not ready, the list was handed over beforehand. We had nothing to\r\ngive in return, but entertained them to the best of our ability.\r\nKajiwara in particular distinguished himself by drinking champagne,\r\nwhiskey, sherry, rum, gin and gin and water without blinking or\r\nshrinking. He was a particularly handsome young fellow, with a fair\r\ncomplexion, and had perfect manners. We gave them a letter of\r\nintroduction to Captain Hewett of the \"Basilisk,\" as they wanted to see\r\na foreign man-of-war. This was the foundation of a close friendship\r\nbetween myself and the Aidzu clan, which survived the war of the\r\nrevolution and the completest possible difference of opinion on Japanese\r\ninternal politics. But they never resented the part we took, clearly\r\nseeing that all the English wanted was the good of the Japanese as a\r\nnation, and that they were not partisans of any faction. Our new friends\r\ncame a couple of days later to tiffin, when they were regaled with\r\nchampagne and preserved meats, greatly to the elevation of their\r\nspirits. It ought to be noted that in those days it was quite the proper\r\nthing to get drunk at a dinner party, and a host whose guests went away\r\nsober would have been mortified by a feeling that his hospitality had\r\nnot been properly appreciated. One of them got very tight, and began to\r\ntalk things unfit for the ears of boys or maidens, while another\r\nproduced a packet of indecent pictures, which he generously distributed\r\namong the four of us. In return for this entertainment Kajiwara invited\r\nus to go and drink _saké_ with him in the evening. We at once accepted,\r\nbut had some trouble with the foreign department officials from Yedo, to\r\nwhom it appeared an improper violation of all precedent for members of a\r\nforeign legation to attend a feast given by a _daimiô's_ man, even\r\nthough the _daimiô_ belonged to the Shôgun's party. We could therefore\r\ntrust them to make every effort behind our backs to prevent the\r\nentertainment coming off.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: GROUP PHOTOGRAPHED DURING A VISIT TO OZAKA\r\n    Yasu. Noguchi. Akum. Mitford. Linfu.\r\n    Satow. Cardew. Thalbitzer.]\r\n\r\nThe afternoon was spent in visiting the boats in which it was proposed\r\nto bring the British Minister and his suite to the temporary Legation,\r\nand a long weary tramp of it we had, but at last we got to the place\r\nwhere they would leave the men-of-wars' boats. Embarking here, we made\r\nan experimental trip ourselves, and came to the conclusion that it would\r\nnot do. To begin with, the distance was very great, and poling against\r\nthe stream was a slow method of progression; next, instead of showing\r\nthemselves to the populace, the minister and his staff would be almost\r\nhidden from view, and would be taken through a succession of narrow,\r\nobscure, and not very clean canals, to a very short distance from their\r\nlodgings, to which they would have to proceed on foot. We found a dense\r\ncrowd had collected at the landing-place to see us, although it was\r\nquite dark. We had been more than a week in the city, and the curiosity\r\nof the inhabitants seemed not a whit abated, though we had traversed the\r\ncity in all directions, and not a day passed without our taking a long\r\nwalk. Noguchi, who had gone with the Aidzu men to find out where the\r\nsymposium was to be held, was not yet back, so reconciling ourselves to\r\nthe idea that the officials had succeeded in putting it off, we sat down\r\nto a dinner of terrapin soup and boiled terrapins. In the middle of it,\r\nhowever, Noguchi appeared to announce that all was ready. The guard\r\nthat usually dogged our steps when we went out had all retired to rest\r\nfor the night, so we got away unaccompanied except by one man carrying a\r\nlantern. The streets were by this time quite deserted, and we hugged\r\nourselves with the consciousness of an adventure. No European had yet\r\nbeen abroad in the streets of a Japanese city at night as a free man. We\r\nhad to walk a couple of miles, and then turn down by the river till we\r\ncame to a house close to the great bridge. Here we found our friends\r\nawaiting our arrival. Blankets were spread for us on the floor at the\r\nupper end of the room, while the Aidzu men sat on cushions opposite to\r\nus, a row of tall candlesticks occupying the centre. Tea was served by\r\nsome very ancient females, and we began again to fear a disappointment,\r\nfor the invitation had been accompanied by a promise to show us some of\r\nthe most celebrated singing and dancing girls of the city. However, when\r\nthe _saké_ was brought up, they descended from the upper storey, where\r\nthey had been engaged in completing their toilette. Some of them were\r\ncertainly pretty, others decidedly ugly, but we thought their looks\r\nruined in any case by the blackened teeth and white-lead-powdered faces.\r\nIn later times I became more accustomed to the shining black teeth which\r\nwere then the distinctive mark of a married woman, as well as of every\r\n\"artiste\" old enough to have an admirer, so much so that when the\r\nempress set the fashion by discontinuing the practice, it was long\r\nbefore I, in common with most Japanese, could reconcile myself to the\r\nnew style. I have always thought Japanese dancing, or rather posturing,\r\nextremely uninteresting. It is a sort of interpreting by more or less\r\ngraceful (or, as one may look at it, affected) movements of body and\r\nlimbs, of the words of a song chanted to the accompaniment of a kind of\r\nthree-stringed lute. It is some help to know the words of the song\r\nbeforehand; they are no more comprehensible when sung than the sounds\r\ngiven forth by the singers in Italian opera are to the majority of their\r\naudience. But no foreigner, unless he be an enthusiast, would ever take\r\nthe trouble to educate himself to appreciate this form of art. He can\r\nenjoy the beautiful in other ways at much less cost of time and mental\r\nexertion. Then it takes a long apprenticeship to accustom the European\r\near to music constructed with a set of intervals that are different\r\nenough from ours to make nine-tenths of the notes seem out of tune. This\r\nform of entertainment is universal all over the east, in India, Burma,\r\nSiam, China and Japan, with local variations, and is, to my uncultivated\r\ntaste, everywhere equally tedious. Our Yedo officials had found us out,\r\nand did not cease to urge our return, until at eleven o'clock we gave\r\nway to their importunity and said good-bye to our hosts, after only a\r\nshort stay. I daresay they kept it up to a much later hour. This was the\r\nevening before we left Ozaka.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XVII\r\n\r\n              RECEPTION OF FOREIGN MINISTERS BY THE TYCOON\r\n\r\n\r\nON our return to Yedo we were horrified to learn of the death by his own\r\nhand of poor Vidal, the junior student interpreter. No motive was\r\nassignable for the terrible act, except ill-health. Insane he certainly\r\nwas not. A more lucid intellect it would be difficult to find. He had\r\nabilities of a very high order, but was a prey to a torpid liver, which\r\nseemed always to embitter his existence. His first nomination was to\r\nSiam, but before he had taken up his appointment he was transferred to\r\nPeking. After a year or two there, finding the climate did not suit him,\r\nhe obtained a change to Japan. But even there he was not content with\r\nhis lot, and preferred annihilation.\r\n\r\nThe next few days were spent in visiting Atami and Hakoné in company\r\nwith some friends from Yokohama. There is nothing worthy of record about\r\nthis excursion, except that Atami, which then contained only a couple of\r\nhotels, now (1887) possesses at least a dozen, and has become a\r\nfashionable winter resort, much frequented by the higher classes living\r\nin Tôkiô (Yedo). The cost of transport then was much less than it would\r\nbe now. We paid the coolies who carried our baggage over to Hakoné, a\r\ndistance of about ten miles, 1-3/4 _ichibus_, about 2 shillings and 4d\r\nper man. At that time there existed a barrier at the eastern end of the\r\nvillage, at which all travellers had to exhibit their passports to the\r\nmen on guard. The notice-board at the guardhouse, among other\r\nprovisions, stated that dead bodies, wounded persons, and individuals of\r\nsuspicious aspect were not allowed to proceed without the production of\r\na passport. A lady of our party accomplished the difficult feat of\r\nriding on a Japanese pony down the steep and badly paved road which\r\ndescends from the top of the pass to Odawara. We established ourselves\r\nin the official inn, where we were received with due respect and\r\ncordiality by the innkeeper. It was a one-storied building spread over a\r\nconsiderable area, and containing ten or fifteen rooms of the regulation\r\nsize, namely 12 feet square, besides a huge kitchen and an entrance\r\nhall. Here we passed the night, and on the following day Noguchi\r\nprocured for us packhorses and coolies at the government rates, which\r\nwere 1 horse load 464 cash, 1 coolie load 233 cash, for a distance of\r\nten miles. Now 6600 cash were equal to one _riô_, that is four\r\n_ichibus_, or at par rates about 5s 4d, so that the official rate for\r\nthe coolie was about two and a fifth pence for the whole distance or a\r\nlittle over the 1/5 of a penny per mile. The coolies were obliged to\r\nperform the labour as corvée, and if they were not in sufficient number,\r\nthe population of the post towns had to hire men at ordinary rates to\r\nlet them out at the government tariff. It was a heavy tax, and one of\r\nthe first reforms of the new government established after the revolution\r\nwas the abolition of this system. At Hodogaya I parted from the rest of\r\nthe party, who returned to Yokohama, and went on to Kanagawa, where I\r\nslept at the _hon-jin_ or official hotel, occupying the best rooms,\r\nwhich were reserved for _daimiôs_ and high officials of the government.\r\nI rode in a _kago_ or palanquin from Hodogaya, just five miles, and was\r\ntwo hours accomplishing that short distance. It was, however, the\r\nordinary rate of travelling in those days. One of the native legation\r\nguard went ahead, also in a _kago_, preceded by a big bamboo and paper\r\nlantern on a pole, then came my _kago_, followed by a coolie carrying my\r\nbaggage in a couple of wicker boxes slung on a pole (_riô-gaké_), and a\r\nsecond guardsman. Noguchi probably walked. Next morning when I came to\r\ndischarge the bill for my whole party, including rooms, _saké_ and\r\n_sakana_, supper and breakfast, I found it amounted to about 8s 6d, and\r\nI gave one _ichibu_ (say 1s 4d) to the hotelkeeper as _cha-dai_ or tea\r\nmoney, which was considered quite enough. In Japan the charge for a\r\nnight's lodging, called _hatago_, used to include everything, rice, tea,\r\nsleeping accommodation, fuel, candles, and use of the hot bath. The only\r\nextras were _saké_ and _sakana_, which a liberal-minded traveller\r\nordered \"for the good of the house,\" but if he was of an economical\r\nturn, he contented himself with the regular two meals, which were quite\r\nenough to satisfy his appetite. _Sakana_ (fish) is more played with than\r\neaten, and is merely the excuse for _saké_. The comparison with a\r\nEuropean hotel bill, with its charges for candles, firing and bath, is\r\nstriking. Moreover, in Japan, you give no tips, for none are expected,\r\nand the tea money takes the place of the charge for the room you occupy.\r\n\r\nIt was after my return from this journey that Mitford and I removed to a\r\nlittle house outside the legation, situated in a pretty garden on the\r\nrising ground which overhangs the side road leading from the Tôkaidô to\r\nSen-gaku-ji. It was in reality a small monastery named Monriô-In, and we\r\noccupied the guest apartments, having each a bedroom and one sitting\r\nroom. No palisade surrounded it, and our only protection was a hut at\r\nthe gate which held three or four of the _betté-gumi_. We thought\r\nourselves very plucky in thus braving the risks of midnight\r\nassassination, when the legation grounds below us were patrolled all\r\nnight, and sentries passed the word to each other as the hours struck.\r\nHere we spent several months together, living entirely on Japanese food,\r\nwhich was brought three times a day from a restaurant known as _Mansei_,\r\nmuch frequented by our friends the Satsuma men.\r\n\r\nMitford devoted himself with unflagging diligence to the study of the\r\nJapanese language, as he had before at Peking to that of the Chinese,\r\nand made rapid progress. I began to compile for his use a series of\r\nsentences and dialogues which some years afterwards were published under\r\nthe title of Kwai-wa Hen. It was convenient to be outside the legation\r\ncompound, because I could receive visits from the retainers of _daimiôs_\r\nwithout obstruction. I used to go a good deal to the Satsuma _yashiki_\r\nin Mita to get political information from two men named Shibayama\r\nRiôsuké and Nambu Yahachirô; the former met his death towards the close\r\nof the year in a remarkable manner. The _yashiki_, having gained evil\r\nrepute as the refuge of a number of _rônin_ and other disorderly\r\npolitical characters, was surrounded and set on fire by the Shôgun's\r\npolice. There was a fight, many were killed, but Shibayama was made\r\nprisoner. When brought up for examination, he boldly avowed that he had\r\nbeen the ringleader, and then drawing a pistol from the bosom of his\r\ndress, shot himself through the head. He was a capital companion, and I\r\nhad more than one agreeable adventure with him.\r\n\r\nTowards the middle of April the foreign diplomatic representatives moved\r\nin a body down to Ozaka. The French Minister, M. Roches, had already\r\nbeen there in March in furtherance of the special line of policy he was\r\npursuing, and seen the Shôgun; doubtless promises of support had been\r\ngiven; at any rate, counsel had been offered. In fact, as it afterwards\r\nturned out, M. Roches so far committed himself with the _Baku-fu_ that\r\nhe found it impossible to remain one day longer in Japan after its final\r\noverthrow. On our side Sir Harry Parkes was resolved henceforth to treat\r\nthe Shôgun as of no more importance than a vice-gerent; henceforward he\r\nwas styled by us His Highness, while for the Queen we used a Japanese\r\ntitle placing her on full equality with the Mikado.\r\n\r\nSir Harry took with him to Ozaka the mounted escort under Captain\r\nApplin, and a detachment of 50 men from the 2/ix, commanded by Captain\r\nDaunt and Lieutenant Bradshaw. Lady Parkes was also of the party. The\r\nstaff consisted of the secretary of legation, Sidney Locock, Mitford,\r\nmyself (I was acting Japanese secretary), Willis, Aston and Wilkinson.\r\nWe had persuaded Sir Harry to let Charles Wirgman come with us. We\r\nnumbered about seventy Europeans, besides some thirty Chinese and\r\nJapanese, writers, servants and grooms. The Tycoon's government\r\nfurnished all the fresh supplies required. Great offence was caused by\r\nthis exclusive privilege, and Rickerby in the \"Japan Times\" poured out\r\nhis wrath upon the head of our friend the artist. It was perhaps not an\r\nunreasonable complaint from their point of view that no representatives\r\nof the mercantile community were invited to accompany the foreign\r\nministers, but it is quite certain that they would have been very much\r\nin the way.\r\n\r\nThe British Legation occupied four spacious temples or monasteries at\r\nthe further end of a street called Tera-machi, the other representatives\r\nbeing accommodated in perhaps somewhat inferior buildings nearer to its\r\nentrance. But the British Minister had taken the trouble to send down\r\ntwo of his staff beforehand to make all the arrangements, while the\r\nothers were ready to be contented with what was provided for them by the\r\nJapanese Government. Mitford, Wirgman and I occupied one end of a temple\r\n(Chô-hô-ji) overlooking the city, while at the other end were Sir\r\nHarry's \"office\" and the temporary chancery. The whole mission messed\r\ntogether in the temple on the other side of the street, where Sir Harry\r\nand Lady Parkes had their abode. Next door was a temple given up to the\r\nofficers of the guard and two student interpreters, and the fourth was\r\nset apart for guests. I had a charming set of rooms on three floors. The\r\nbottom was occupied by the Japanese writers and my retainers, the centre\r\nfloor, consisting of two rooms, served as a bedroom and \"office,\" and\r\nthe top was a sort of parlour where I received guests, only twelve feet\r\nby nine, but large enough to accommodate a dozen persons, as it did not\r\ncontain a single piece of furniture.\r\n\r\nIt was a busy time. I was employed from morning till night translating\r\nand interpreting, and remember that on one occasion I had to talk\r\nJapanese for eleven successive hours, as the chief had Japanese guests\r\nboth at luncheon and dinner. For this reason I found no time to keep my\r\njournal, and what follows is a pure effort of memory, aided only as far\r\nas the dates are concerned by reference to printed sources.\r\n\r\nA great part of our time was taken up with the regulations under which\r\nsettlements were to be formed at Hiôgo and Ozaka, the conditions under\r\nwhich land was to be leased to foreigners, and the creation of a\r\nmunicipality at each place, and Sir Harry being the most practical man\r\namong the whole body of foreign representatives, the work fell in the\r\nmain on his shoulders. The Japanese Government were evidently desirous\r\nof conciliating the representatives, and the negotiations proceeded with\r\nunaccustomed smoothness and celerity. No more angry discussions and\r\nheated arguments (in which the heat and anger of our chief were opposed\r\nto the stolid calm of the imperturbable Japanese Ministers) such as had\r\ncharacterized our official interviews at Yedo. At the word of the new\r\nShôgun an entirely new line had been adopted, and a serious endeavour\r\nwas made to convert the treaty of friendship into a reality.\r\n\r\nThen we had visits from Satsuma, Awa and Uwajima men, and tried to\r\nascertain what was likely to be the out-turn of the political movement\r\nthat had been in progress now for thirteen years. But on the whole\r\neverything seemed to point to the triumph of the Shôgun over his\r\nopponents. And one of the principal objects with which he had invited\r\nthe foreign ministers to Ozaka was that he might make their personal\r\nacquaintance, and thus manifest his desire to cultivate friendly\r\nrelations with foreign countries. Who put this into his head I do not\r\nknow, but it does not seem _á priori_ unlikely that a closer intimacy\r\nwith the legations had been suggested to him by one of the\r\nrepresentatives themselves. A good deal of time was consumed in\r\ndiscussing the etiquette to be observed at the audiences of the Shôgun,\r\nbut in the end it was arranged that it should be entirely according to\r\nEuropean fashion. The first interview was a private one. Sir Harry\r\nproceeded to the castle on horseback, accompanied by all the members of\r\nthe mission, preceded by the mounted escort, and with a detachment of\r\nthe infantry guard before and behind. A cloud of the Japanese guard\r\ncalled _betté-gumi_ hovered on our flanks and kept back the crowd. A\r\nrather ludicrous incident was the presentation of arms by the soldiers\r\nwho lined the open space in front of the castle to the officer in\r\ncommand of the escort, whose resplendent uniform had led them to mistake\r\nhim for the minister. At the nearer end of the causeway crossing the\r\nmoat there used to stand a wooden board inscribed with the Chinese\r\ncharacters for \"alight from horseback,\" but as had been agreed upon\r\nbeforehand, we took no notice of this and passed on through the gateway\r\nto the very door of the palace. If I recollect rightly, this was almost\r\nclose to the gate. The palace unfortunately exists no longer, having\r\nbeen destroyed by fire during the retreat of the defeated _Baku-fu_\r\nforces early in February 1868. But it was reputed to be the most\r\nsplendid example of domestic architecture then extant in Japan. It\r\ncertainly was far superior to the Mikado's Palace at Kiôto. Wide and\r\nlofty matted corridors, partitioned off by painted screens, of choice\r\ncryptomeria wood, ran along the front of a succession of large rooms and\r\naway to the right by the side of the three large apartments constituting\r\nthe _ôbiroma_ or hall of audience. The other apartments had each a\r\nspecific name, and the _daimiôs_ were classified according to their\r\nright of waiting in one or the other for their turn of admission to the\r\npresence. Over these wooden screens were large panels of carved wood\r\nrepresenting birds and animals surrounded by foliage, but somewhat too\r\nrichly painted, very much in the style familiar to those who have\r\nvisited the mausoleum of Iyéyasu at Nikkô.\r\n\r\nWe were conducted along the matted corridor by the Commissioners for\r\nForeign Affairs, who had some difficulty in walking, as the court rules\r\nprescribed their wearing long wide trousers that extended far beyond\r\ntheir feet, so as to give them the appearance of moving on their knees,\r\nuntil we reached the further room, where the Shôgun was awaiting us. He\r\nshook hands with Sir Harry, and sat down at the head of a long table,\r\nwith Sir Harry on his right and on his left Itakura Iga no Kami, who\r\nmight be styled Prime Minister. The rest of the staff sat next to Sir\r\nHarry, and I had a stool between him and the Shôgun. He was one of the\r\nmost aristocratic-looking Japanese I have ever seen, of fair complexion,\r\nwith a high forehead and well-cut nose--such a gentleman. I felt\r\nsomewhat nervous, not knowing whether I had got hold of the forms of\r\nspeech required by court etiquette, and remember making a ridiculous\r\nblunder over an observation of Sir Harry's that all that was\r\ndisagreeable in the past relations of Great Britain and Japan was now\r\nforgotten. There was no business talk on this occasion, and after the\r\nconversation was over, the whole company adjourned to a smaller\r\napartment where dinner was served in European style. The Shôgun sat at\r\nthe head of the table, and was very gracious. Round the walls hung\r\npaintings of the thirty-six poets, and Sir Harry having admired them,\r\nthe Shôgun made him a present of one. Whiskey and water were produced\r\nafter the repast, and I had the honour of brewing toddy for the great\r\nman. It was dark when we left.\r\n\r\nA few days later there was a formal audience, at which the captains of\r\nthe men-of-war were presented. We had arranged beforehand the address of\r\nSir Harry and the reply of the Shôgun, who had been tutored also into\r\nsaying a few words to each person presented to him. These somewhat\r\nresembled the Turkish Pasha's remarks as translated by the dragoman at\r\nthe famous interview described in _Eothen_. To Captain Haswell, who had\r\nbeen on a polar expedition, for instance, he said what really amounted\r\nto \"you had a long journey,\" but was interpreted in much more\r\ncomplimentary style.\r\n\r\nI remember receiving a visit from Saigô and others of that party, who\r\nwere not at all pleased at the _rapprochement_ between us and the\r\nShôgun. I hinted to Saigô that the chance of a revolution was not to be\r\nlost. If Hiôgo were once opened, then good-bye to the chances of the\r\n_daimiôs_.\r\n\r\nThe street in which the foreign representatives lodged was shut in at\r\neach end by solid wooden gates, at which a number of the _betté-gumi_\r\nwere stationed on guard day and night, and it was impossible to get out\r\ninto the city without an escort, as the guard had instructions to follow\r\nus wherever we went. This was very irksome to Mitford and myself, until\r\nwe found out a gap in the wall which surrounded one of the temples, and\r\nfrom that time we used to make nocturnal excursions to all parts of the\r\ntown, accompanied by my retainer Noguchi. The sense of a certain peril\r\nto be encountered, combined with a sort of truant schoolboy feeling,\r\nrendered these explorations into the night life of Japan very enjoyable.\r\nOn one occasion young Matsuné joined us on an expedition to the quarter\r\noccupied by singing and dancing girls; it was a moonlight night, and the\r\nchance of detection by the guard was so much the greater. After getting\r\nthrough our gap, we doubled back, and passing behind the legations, got\r\ninto a lower street running parallel to that in which we lived, where we\r\nran along for some distance keeping close in the shadow of the houses,\r\nthen darted into another street at right angles, turned to the right\r\nagain until we felt sure of having baffled any possible pursuers, after\r\nwhich we walked on quietly, and crossing one of the long bridges over\r\nthe river, found ourselves at our destination. A room had been taken in\r\nMatsuné's name, and some of the bepowdered and berouged girls were\r\nawaiting the arrival of the Japanese party they had expected to meet,\r\nwhen to their surprise and horror three Europeans were ushered into\r\ntheir midst. We were at that time objects of more alarm than interest to\r\nthe women of Ozaka. The fair damsels starting up with a scream fairly\r\nran away, and no assurances from our friend would induce them to return.\r\nThe keeper of the house besought us to leave, as a crowd might collect,\r\nand if there was any disturbance he would get into trouble, and so we\r\nhad to submit to our disappointment. But even the slight glimpse we had\r\nof the native beauties seemed to compensate for the risk run, for here\r\nin Ozaka no foreigner had ever been admitted to the quarter. On another\r\noccasion, when we were accompanied by some of the guard we had better\r\nsuccess, and enjoyed the society of some gei-shas for several hours, the\r\ngovernment officials having given their consent and even interfered, I\r\nbelieve, on our behalf. Matsuné, being a _daimiô's_ man, was looked on\r\nwith much suspicion. It seemed a plucky thing on his part to spend so\r\nmuch time with us, and even to accompany us in broad daylight to the\r\ntea-gardens opposite to where the Mint now stands. Everything was new\r\nand delightful in Ozaka, politics and diplomacy afforded unceasing\r\ninterest and excitement, the streets, shops, theatres and temples were\r\nfull of life and character of a kind thoroughly distinct from what we\r\nwere accustomed to in Yedo and Yokohama, and the difference of dialect\r\nand costume imparted additional piquancy to the women.\r\n\r\nDuring the whole five weeks we spent there we had not a single dull day.\r\nThere was always something to do in the intervals of our official work,\r\nvisits to temples and theatres, tea-drinking according to the elaborate\r\nceremonial of the _cha-no-yu_, an excursion to the large commercial town\r\nof Sakai, the existence of which in such close proximity to Ozaka seems\r\nhard to explain. Near our residence was a florist's establishment,\r\nfamous for its collection of orchids, which in Japan are cultivated more\r\nfor their foliage than for their flowers; this taste is conditioned by\r\nthe fact that in Loochoo, China and Japan there are very few species\r\nbearing conspicuous or fine blossoms, and the amateur makes the best of\r\nwhat is procurable. More attractive to the European was the exhibition\r\nof tree-peonies, which was going on during our stay. These flowers are\r\nnow fashionable in England, but at that time were not much known; the\r\nmagnificent pink or white blossoms of various shades, often as much as\r\nnine inches in diameter, are quite unsurpassable, and fully justify the\r\nChinese title of \"king of flowers.\" In Chinese and Japanese decorative\r\nart it is always associated with the lion, and has often been mistaken\r\nfor the rose by European writers. _Curio_ shops and silk stores also\r\ntook up a good deal of our time, but the fabrics of the loom had not\r\nthen attained the high artistic development of later years. We went\r\nabout the city in every direction, and though frequently encountering\r\nmen of the two-sworded class, never met with any instance of rudeness,\r\nwhile the common people were uniformly friendly to us.\r\n\r\nThe negotiations between the foreign representatives and the delegates\r\nof the Japanese Government proceeded satisfactorily though somewhat\r\nslowly, and about the middle of May had reached a stage at which it was\r\nfelt that nothing more could be done for the present. All the ministers,\r\ntherefore, made their preparations for returning to Yedo. Before leaving\r\nthat part of the country Sir Harry made a trip across to Tsuruga, which\r\nhad been talked of as a possible substitute for the port of Niigata,\r\nreported to be practically closed to commerce for one half of the year\r\nby the combined inconveniences of a bar at the mouth of the river on\r\nwhich it stands, and the persistent north-west gales that raise a most\r\ndangerous sea. It had been agreed between us and the Japanese that as a\r\nsupplementary refuge for ships the harbour of Ebisuminato in the island\r\nof Sado should be opened if necessary, but only as an anchorage. If\r\nafter an inspection of these two places the combined arrangement should\r\nappear unworkable, then some other port was to be substituted, either\r\nTsuruga or Nanao. Sir Harry was accompanied by Lady Parkes and some of\r\nthe staff. He proceeded by way of Fushimi, along the western side of the\r\nBiwa Lake, and returning by the eastern shore. The anti-Shôgun party\r\nmade a great grievance of this journey, and fell foul of the government\r\nfor having permitted the \"barbarians\" to approach so near to the sacred\r\ncapital, Fushimi being practically a suburb of Kiôto, and the Satsuma\r\npeople put in a written memorial on the subject, more to annoy the\r\nTycoon's government than as a mark of real hostility to us. Of course we\r\ndid not know of this until long after. I obtained leave to return to\r\nYedo overland, and Wirgman became my travelling companion.\r\n\r\nA proposal was made to Sir Harry by the Tycoon's government through\r\nKawakatsu Omi no Kami to procure professors for English for a large\r\npublic school to be established in Yedo on the basis of the existing\r\nKaiseijo. Dr Temple was asked by Her Majesty's Government to furnish a\r\nsufficient staff at salaries which we in the legation thought quite\r\nadequate, but he took no trouble about the matter, and we thus lost the\r\nopportunity of giving an English turn to the higher class education of\r\nthe country.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XVIII\r\n\r\n                      OVERLAND FROM OZAKA TO YEDO\r\n\r\n\r\nFOR centuries the interior of Japan had been closed to all Europeans,\r\nwith the exception of the head of the Dutch trading factory at Nagasaki,\r\nwho used to travel overland to Yedo at fixed intervals to pay his\r\nrespects to the Shôgun and carry valuable presents to him and his\r\nministers. Perhaps the best account of these tribute bearing missions is\r\nto be found in Kaempfer. But in the new treaties a provision had been\r\ninserted giving to the diplomatic representatives of foreign powers the\r\nright of travelling throughout the country, and Sir Rutherford Alcock\r\nhad availed himself of this privilege a few years earlier, as he has\r\nrecounted in his \"Court and Capital of the Tycoon.\" As a guide to\r\nsucceeding travellers it cannot be said that his description of the\r\njourney was of much assistance. But the Japanese are great travellers\r\nthemselves, and the booksellers' shops abound in printed itineraries\r\nwhich furnish the minutest possible information about inns, roads,\r\ndistances, ferries, temples, productions, and other particulars which\r\nthe tourist requires. Then a fairly good map was easily procurable, not\r\ndrawn to scale, but affording every geographical detail that can be of\r\nany real service, and there was a splendid illustrated guidebook to the\r\nTôkaidô containing all the legendary and historical lore that an\r\nEnglishman accustomed to his Murray can desire. There are two great\r\nroads which unite the eastern and western capitals, namely the Nakasendô\r\nor road through the mountains, which, as its name implies, traverses the\r\ncentral provinces, and the Tôkaidô or road along the sea to the east,\r\nwhich follows the sea shore wherever practicable. Properly speaking this\r\nis not the original name of the road, but rather of the administrative\r\ndivision through which it runs, but practically it came to the same\r\nthing. It was the latter which had been chosen for me as the principal\r\nhighway in the country, and the best provided with inn accommodation.\r\nEver since the third Tokugawa Shôgun established the rule that each\r\n_daimiô_ must pass a portion of the year in Yedo, the great highroads\r\nhad become important means of internal communication. Posting stations\r\nwere established at every few miles for the supply of porters and\r\nbaggage ponies, and at each of these were erected one or two official\r\ninns called _hon-jin_ for the use of _daimiôs_ and high functionaries of\r\ngovernment. Around these sprang up a crowd of private inns and houses of\r\nentertainment where the _daimiôs_' retainers and travelling merchants\r\nused to put up. The Tôkaidô was the recognized route for all the\r\n_daimiôs_ west of Kiôto, and of course for those whose territories lay\r\nalong it. Then it was the main route for the pilgrims who flocked\r\nannually to the sacred shrines in Isé, and was the means of access to\r\nmany other famous temples; so that of all the roads in Japan it was the\r\nmost frequented and the most important from every point of view. Who\r\nthat collects Japanese colour prints is unacquainted with the numerous\r\ndelightful series of views devoted to its illustration, which present\r\nsuch vivid pictures of Japanese life. One of the most famous of all\r\nnative novels is occupied with the adventures of a couple of merry dogs\r\non their way from Yedo up to Kiôto, and the list of its fifty-three\r\nposting towns was one of the first lessons in reading and writing which\r\nthe youth of Japan had to commit to memory. On account of its historical\r\nand legendary associations, to say nothing of its famous scenery, it\r\noccupied something of the same place in the imaginations of the Japanese\r\nthat the Rhine formerly did in the minds of English tourists before the\r\nLoreley rock had been tunnelled, and crowds of indifferent travellers\r\nwere hastily whirled in a few hours along an iron track on either side\r\nof the great stream which at one time it was the fashion to \"do\" with\r\ndignity in a carriage and four. Carefully as one may study a map, there\r\nis no way of learning geography comparable to the pedestrian method,\r\nwhich, by a thousand associations of pleasure, fatigue and weather,\r\nfixes indelibly the minutest topographical facts, and enables the\r\nstudent of history to understand the vicissitudes of warfare.\r\n\r\nJapan being a country where a peculiar political system had taken its\r\nbirth from centuries of civil war, the more we saw of its interior\r\ndistricts, the more likely were we to arrive at a correct understanding\r\nof the problem which at that moment was being attacked by the rival\r\nparties. I do not pretend that any considerations such as these\r\ndetermined my application to the chief for permission to return to\r\nheadquarters by land. Insatiable curiosity as to everything Japanese, a\r\ncertain love of adventure, and dislike of life on board of a man-of-war\r\nwere the real motives, the last perhaps as strong as any, and probably\r\nmany persons would agree with me in preferring to spend a day in walking\r\nfrom Calais to Dover, if it were practicable, to taking their chance of\r\nrough weather in a steamer, even though it might not last for more than\r\nan hour and ten minutes.\r\n\r\nWirgman and I were by this time so accustomed to living on Japanese food\r\nthat we resolved not to burden ourselves with stores of any kind, knives\r\nor forks, finger glasses or table napkins. Ponies were not procurable,\r\nso we bought a couple of secondhand palanquins, called _hikido kago_,\r\nsuch as were used by public officials, and had them repaired. They cost\r\nthe small price of 32 ichibus each, or not £4. The pole was a long piece\r\nof deal, called by euphemism paulownia wood. A cushion of silk damask,\r\nthickly stuffed with raw cotton, was spread on the bottom, and there was\r\nthen just room enough to sit in it cross-legged without discomfort. In\r\nfront was a small shelf above the window, and underneath a small flap\r\nwhich served as a table. The sliding doors also had windows, furnished\r\nwith a paper slide to exclude cold, and another covered with gauze to\r\nkeep out the dust while letting in the air. If it rained, blinds made of\r\nslender strips of bamboo were let down over the windows. The body of the\r\npalanquin could also be enveloped in a covering of black oiled paper, in\r\nwhich a small aperture was left for the occupant to peep out of, a blind\r\nof the same material being propped up outside; this arrangement was,\r\nhowever, only resorted to on days of persistent rain. Each of us had a\r\npair of oblong wicker-work baskets to hold our clothing, called\r\n_riô-gaké_, which were slung at opposite ends of a black pole and\r\ncarried by one man over his shoulder. My bedding, which consisted of a\r\ncouple of Japanese mattresses covered with white crape and edged with a\r\nbroad border of common brocade known as _yamato nishiki_, and one of the\r\nhuge stuffed bedgowns called yogi of figured crape with a velvet collar,\r\nwith a couple of European pillows, was packed in a wicker box of the\r\nkind called _akéni_, and formed a burden for two men. To each package\r\nwas fastened a small deal board on which my name and titles were\r\ninscribed with Indian ink in large Chinese characters. As escort we had\r\nten picked men belonging to the native legation guard (_betté gumi_),\r\nand a couple of officials belonging to the Japanese Foreign Department\r\n(_gai-koku-gata_) were attached to us, who were instructed to make\r\narrangements for our accommodation along the road. Last of all, a list\r\nwas made out of the places at which we were to take our mid-day meals\r\nand sleep at night, the journey of 320 miles from Fushimi being\r\ncalculated to occupy sixteen days.\r\n\r\nOn the 18th May, having exchanged farewell calls with the commissioners\r\nof foreign affairs, we got away from our temple lodging at nine o'clock\r\nin the morning. Willis, who was to join Sir Harry Parkes' party at\r\nFushimi, accompanied us. We embarked at the Hachikenya wharf on the\r\nriver side in a houseboat, the escort and _gai-koku-gata_ in another,\r\ntwo open boats following with the luggage of the whole party. The stream\r\nwas very strong, and our progress was correspondingly slow, but we felt\r\nthat we were travelling in a dignified manner, and therefore repressed\r\nour natural impatience. Where the stream was deep enough close in shore,\r\nthe boatmen landed, and towed us by a line attached to the top of a mast\r\nfixed in the front of the boat, while the steersman remained at his post\r\nto prevent us from running into the bank. When the towing path changed\r\nto the opposite side, the boatmen came on board and poled across to\r\nresume their labour as before. The river, which winds a good deal, is\r\nenclosed between lofty dykes, so that we had no prospect but the broad\r\nsurface of the river itself and the tops of ranges of mountains peering\r\nover the bank. It was a fine day, and we were full of eager\r\nanticipations about the novel scenes we were about to pass through,\r\nevery inch of the way being entirely new to us as far as Hakoné, and for\r\nmyself the prospect of a fortnight's holiday was especially exhilarating\r\nafter the hard work of the past five weeks.\r\n\r\nBy one o'clock we reached Suido mura, a small village on the right bank\r\nabout five miles above Ozaka, and landed to take our lunch. There was\r\nnothing to be had but rice and bean-curd, which did not constitute a\r\nvery palatable meal. But _à la guerre comme à la guerre_. We passed a\r\nlarge number of crowded passenger boats descending the river, and ten\r\nbarges laden with bales of rice. At half-past six we stopped at\r\nHirakata, a somewhat more important place than Suido mura. Here we\r\nlanded to dine off soup, fish and rice, the ordinary constituents of a\r\ntraveller's meal. The charge for our three selves and three servants was\r\nless than an _ichibu_, and a second _ichibu_ was given as _cha-dai_ or\r\n\"tea-money.\" Noguchi was paymaster, and gave whatever he thought right\r\nunder this heading. The charge seemed extraordinarily cheap, which was\r\nexplained by a regulation binding innkeepers to supply persons\r\ntravelling in an official capacity at one quarter of the rates charged\r\nto ordinary people. We started again by moonlight, and as the night\r\nadvanced, a thin mist rose and covered the surface of the broad river,\r\nimparting to the landscape that mysterious, sketchy indistinctness which\r\nis so characteristic of Japan, that none but native artists whose eyes\r\nhave been educated to it from their childhood have ever been able to\r\nseize and represent.\r\n\r\nThe air now became as cold as it had been hot during the day time. We\r\nhad blankets fetched from one of the baggage boats, and lay down to\r\nsleep in opposite corners of the boat. At two in the morning I woke and\r\nfound that we were lying off the guardhouse on the right bank opposite\r\nto Hashimoto, which was held by troops of Matsudaira Hôki no Kami, a\r\nmember of the Tycoon's Council, the other bank being in the charge of\r\nTôdô, the _daimiô_ of Isé. We had been as far as Yodo, where they turned\r\nus back because our pass had not been viséd here, and we did not reach\r\nYodo again till four o'clock. It was still dark, the moon having set\r\nduring the night. The river is here joined by the Kidzu kawa, and is\r\ndivided into several channels by islands lying in its course. We kept\r\nalong the right bank, and arrived at Fushimi about six, where we found\r\nSir Harry on the point of starting for Tsuruga. Here a generous member\r\nof his party gave us a last cigar. Our stock had been completely\r\nexhausted during the long stay in Ozaka, and for the rest of the journey\r\nwe had to content ourselves with Japanese tobacco, smoked in tiny whiffs\r\nout of the diminutive native pipes, all inadequate to satisfy a craving\r\nnourished on something stronger. The worst of the Japanese pipe, with\r\nits metal bowl and mouthpiece united by a hard bamboo stem, is the\r\nrapidity with which it gets foul, necessitating cleaning at least once a\r\nday with a slender spill twisted out of tough mulberry-bark paper.\r\nWillis left us here, and joined the chief. Special precautions had been\r\ntaken by the government to prevent Sir Harry turning aside to Kiôto,\r\nwhich it was thought his adventurous disposition might tempt him to\r\nvisit.\r\n\r\nAfter breakfast we started in our _kagos_ for the journey overland. A\r\ncrowd of _machi-kata_, who were a sort of municipal officers of all\r\ngrades, dressed in their Sunday best, escorted us out of the town. Our\r\nroad lay for a mile or so between the banks of the Uji-kawa and the low,\r\nfir-clad hills masked by clumps of graceful bamboo, and then leaving the\r\ntea plantations of Uji to the right, we journeyed along a level road\r\nwinding through the hills to Oiwaké, where we joined the Tôkaidô. A kind\r\nof stone tramway ran from Kiôto all the way to Otsu, our next\r\nresting-place, for the heavy, broad-wheeled bullock carts, of which we\r\npassed a couple of score laden with rice for the use of the Tycoon's\r\ngarrison at the capital. Oiwaké was famous for pipes, counting boards\r\n(_abacus_), and a species of comic prints called _toba-yé_, and lies at\r\nthe foot of the hills separating the province of Yamashiro from the\r\nbeautiful Biwa Lake. By the roadside we had an opportunity of inspecting\r\nsome tea-firing establishments on a small scale, like every other\r\nmanufacturing enterprise in those days. The fresh tea leaves were\r\ndamped, then spread out on a flat table heated from beneath by fuel\r\nenclosed in a plastered chamber, and twisted by hand. This new tea forms\r\na delicious and refreshing drink when infused after the Japanese method\r\nfor the finer qualities, with lukewarm water. At each establishment\r\nthere were not more than two persons at work.\r\n\r\nAt one o'clock we got to Otsu, and after lunch went to a monastery\r\ncalled Riô-zen-ji to enjoy the celebrated prospect of the lake, but the\r\nmid-day heat had covered its surface with a dull grey haze, and hid it\r\nentirely from view. We found everything nicely arranged for us at\r\nTakajima-ya, where we rested for the mid-day meal, while the escort and\r\nforeign office men in our train vied in accommodating themselves to our\r\nwishes. From Otsu a level road skirted the lake, and, soon after passing\r\nthrough Zézé, the \"castle town\" of Honda Oki no Kami, we got out to\r\nwalk. In crossing the great double bridge of Séta we saw a couple of men\r\nin a boat spinning for carp; the shallows here are crowded with traps,\r\nirregular shaped enclosures of reeds planted in the mud, into which the\r\nfish enter when stormy winds agitate the surface of the water and\r\ndeprive them of their equanimity. But before reaching Kusatsu, where we\r\nwere to put up for the night, we retreated into our kagos, in order not\r\nto be overwhelmed by the crowd, and for the better preservation of our\r\ndignity, which required that we should not be seen on foot. At the\r\nconfines of the town we were met by a deputation of the municipal\r\nofficers and by the host of the official inn, who escorted us in with\r\ngreat pomp, keeping back the inquisitive multitude. Our bearers\r\nquickened their pace, not indeed to our satisfaction, for the _kago_,\r\nwhich is uncomfortable at all times, becomes almost uninhabitable when\r\nthe men get out of a walk.\r\n\r\nAt last we turned round a corner, and passing through a black gate,\r\nbefore the posts of which were two neatly piled-up heaps of sand,\r\nflanked by buckets of water, were set down in the wide porch of the\r\nofficial inn. It was one of the most beautifully decorated buildings of\r\nits kind that I have ever seen. That implies woodwork of the finest\r\ngrain, plaster of the least obtrusive shades of colour, sliding doors\r\npapered with an artistic pattern touched up with gold leaf and framed\r\nwith shining black lacquered wood, and hard thick mats of the palest\r\nstraw edged with stencilled cotton cloth. In the principal room, only\r\ntwelve feet square, raised six inches above the rest of the house, lay\r\ntwo thick mats forming a sort of bed-place, where the distinguished\r\ntraveller was expected to squat without moving. The baggage was\r\ndeposited in the corridor which ran round two sides of the apartment.\r\nThere was no view from the windows, which looked out on a small\r\ncourtyard enclosed by a sulky-looking, black wooden fence. Etiquette\r\nprescribed that a great man should neither see nor be seen. Our host\r\ncame in with a small present, and bowed his forehead to the sill. After\r\na few minutes he returned to give thanks in the same humble manner for\r\nthe gift of two _ichibus_ which he had received as _cha-dai_. We went in\r\nturn to the hot bath, where a modest, not to say prim, young damsel\r\nasked whether she might have the honour of washing our \"august\" back,\r\nbut not being trained from our youth up to be waited on by lovely\r\nfemales during our ablutions, we declined her assistance.\r\n\r\nAt dinner time we ordered a dish of fish and a bottle of _saké_, which\r\nhad to be several times replenished before the artist had had enough.\r\nThe people of the inn were astonished to find that we could eat rice,\r\nhaving been taught to believe that the food of Europeans consisted\r\nexclusively of beef and pork. When we went to bed, soft silk mattresses\r\nin plenty were spread on the floor, and the chambermaid placed within\r\nthe mosquito net a fire-box with a bit of red-hot charcoal neatly\r\nembedded in white ashes for a last smoke, and a pot of freshly-infused\r\ntea. _O yasumi nasai_, be pleased to take your august rest, was the end\r\nof the first day.\r\n\r\nIn Japan travellers are in the habit of making an early start. A native\r\nusually rises before day, makes a hasty toilet by scrubbing his teeth\r\nwith a handful of salt from a basket hanging over the kitchen sink,\r\nwashes his hands and face without soap, swallows a hasty breakfast, and\r\nis on the road as soon as the sun is up, or even earlier. His principal\r\nobject is to arrive at the town where he is going to pass the night at\r\nas early an hour as possible, in order to secure a good room and the\r\nfirst turn at the hot bath, there being only one tub and one water for\r\nthe whole of the guests. In some out of the way places this is not even\r\nchanged every day, and I remember on one occasion to have found the bath\r\nabsolutely green with age and odorous in proportion. We were not\r\nexpected to do as the vulgar herd, and did not get away much before\r\nhalf-past seven. Our average rate of going was about three miles an\r\nhour, and the day's journey not over twenty miles, but there were so\r\nmany interruptions that we rarely reached our evening's destination\r\nbefore six o'clock.\r\n\r\nFirst and foremost there was the mid-day meal (_o hiru yasumi_), which\r\nconsumed at least an hour, and then our exalted rank required that we\r\nshould stop to rest (_o ko-yasumi_) at least once in the morning and\r\nonce again in the afternoon. Then we stopped again at every point of\r\nview to drink tea, and to taste every dish of cakes or other comestibles\r\nof which centuries of wayfarers had been in the habit of partaking\r\nbefore us. Thus on the third day we stopped at Mmé-no-ki to take tea at\r\na house commanding a fine view of the legendary mountain Mukadé yama\r\n(Centipede's Mount), and again for half-an-hour at Ishibé, where a big\r\nboard was stuck up outside inscribed with \"the little resting-place of\r\nthe interpreter (the officer) of England.\" We lunched sumptuously at\r\nMinakuchi on fish, soup and rice, and so got through an hour and a\r\nquarter. At Ono, celebrated for pheasants' meat preserved in _miso_\r\npaste, we again drank tea, which was served out by pretty girls who made\r\na great pretence of bashfulness. Wirgman's costume, consisting of wide\r\nblue cotton trousers, a loose yellow pongee jacket, no collar, and a\r\nconical hat of grey felt, gave rise to a grave discussion as to whether\r\nhe was really an European, or only a Chinaman after all. At Mayéno, a\r\ncentre of tea production, we stopped for another half-hour to taste\r\nseveral sorts of leaf at a tea-dealer's shop. This was a great act of\r\ncondescension on the part of such distinguished personages, but we made\r\nup for this derogation from our dignity by having our purchases paid for\r\nby Noguchi, the real Japanese swell being supposed to know nothing about\r\nmoney, not even theoretically. The dealer declared that unless the leaf\r\nis picked and fired by virgins, it will not be drinkable, but I fear he\r\nwas humbugging the innocent foreigner.\r\n\r\nMany of the houses bore a notice-paper inscribed with Chinese characters\r\nmeaning \"Economy in all things,\" a laconic sentence which was\r\ninterpreted to signify that the occupants had forsworn social\r\nentertainments and other unnecessary sources of expenditure. Wirgman\r\nmade himself very popular by the sketches he threw off and gave away to\r\nthe innkeepers, sometimes of ourselves as we appeared on the road, or of\r\na bit of local scenery, or perhaps a pretty girl, whose bashful pride on\r\ndiscovering that her features had been perpetuated on paper was a\r\npleasant sight to contemplate. It usually took some time before the\r\nwaiting maids overcame what seemed to us to be their excessive modesty,\r\nbut it was explained to us that women were not usually permitted to\r\napproach the dais-room, as noble swells had their own men-servants to\r\nattend on them. We regretted the exigencies of our lofty position, and\r\npitied the _daimiôs_ who have always to be correct and proper--in\r\npublic. Another consequence of our supposed high rank was that in many\r\ntowns the people knelt down by the side of the street as we passed\r\nalong, being invited to assume that posture by the municipal officers\r\nwho preceded us beadle-fashion, crying out _Shitaniro, shitaniro_\r\n(\"down, down\"). This honour used in those days to be rendered to every\r\n_daimiô_, no matter whether travelling in his own dominions or those of\r\nanother nobleman, and also to the high officials of the Shôgun's\r\ngovernment, as, for example, the governor of Kanagawa, to the great\r\nindignation of the European residents. The only reported instance of a\r\nforeigner ever submitting to this indignity was that of Mr Eugene van\r\nReed, who is said to have fallen in with the train of Shimadzu Saburô on\r\nthe day fatal to poor Richardson, and to have then and there conformed\r\nto the native custom. The practice had its origin, perhaps, in the\r\nnecessity of protecting the nobles from sudden attack, combined with the\r\nrule of Japanese etiquette which considers that a standing posture\r\nimplies disrespect. This latter fact was forcibly impressed on me at\r\nFuchiû, where I went to visit the public school for the sons of\r\n_samurai_. Having taken off my shoes and laid my hat on the floor at the\r\nentrance, I was escorted into a room where about thirty youngsters were\r\nsquatting on the floor, with Chinese books before them which they were\r\nlearning to repeat by rote from the mouths of older and more advanced\r\npupils, under the superintendence of half-a-dozen professors. I bowed\r\nand remained standing, but to my surprise no one acknowledged my salute;\r\nI had in my ignorance of propriety assumed what to the Japanese appeared\r\nan attitude of disrespect, and it was only on being admonished by one of\r\nthe escort that I discovered my error, which being at once repaired, the\r\nprofessors returned my bow, made in proper form with head to the ground.\r\nI afterwards found it necessary to adopt Japanese manners, as far as was\r\ncompatible with a certain stiff-jointedness that forbade my sitting on\r\nmy heels for more than a very limited period, but could never resist the\r\nuneasy feeling that while I was pressing my forehead on the mats, the\r\nman opposite might perhaps be taking advantage of the opportunity to\r\ninflict a slight on the \"barbarian\" by sitting bolt upright. In fact,\r\nJapanese themselves were not exempt from a similar uncertainty, and they\r\nmight sometimes be detected, whilst performing the obeisance, in the act\r\nof squinting sideways to ascertain whether the person they were saluting\r\nlowered his head simultaneously and to the same level.\r\n\r\nWhenever we passed through a town of any importance, the population\r\nturned out _en masse_, eager to convert the occasion into a holiday. At\r\nKaméyama, for instance, which is a _daimiô's_ castle town, the streets\r\nwere thronged with _samurai_ and their children in gala dress,\r\npresenting a gay appearance; some of the young girls were extremely\r\npretty, in spite of the quantity of white powder with which fashion\r\ncondemned them to bedaub their faces.\r\n\r\nSome odd methods of locomotion were practised in this part of the\r\ncountry, such as children riding in nets of coarse cord suspended from\r\nopposite ends of a pole carried by a man on his shoulder, women riding\r\nin pairs on packhorses, and in the flat plain between Séki and Kuwana in\r\nsmall open omnibuses, not unlike the costermonger's carts in which fruit\r\nis hawked about the streets of London, but drawn by a man instead of a\r\ndonkey; perhaps half-a-dozen grown-up persons in one of these small\r\nvehicles, the precursors of the jinrikisha which came into vogue in\r\n1869. Wirgman, who was too careless of his dignity (for he was\r\ntravelling not as an artist, but in the quality of a _yakunin_ or\r\ngovernment official), insisted in getting into one of these, and rode\r\nall the way from Tomida to Kuwana, a distance of at least five miles,\r\nfor three tempôes, say 2-1/2d. At a tea-house at Komuki we were\r\npresented by our host with some teapots of very inferior Banko ware;\r\nthis is the famous unglazed pottery moulded by hand, and showing all\r\nover its surface, both inside and outside, the marks of finger tips.\r\n\r\nOn the 22nd we reached Kuwana, a large town belonging to one of the\r\nprincipal hereditary vassals of the Tokugawa family. Here an enormous\r\nconcourse of people had collected to see us make our entry, and we had\r\nsome difficulty in making our way through the crush, until suddenly the\r\nprocession turned aside through a gateway under a tower, and traversed\r\nthe outer enceinte of the castle, finally arriving at the official inn\r\non the shore of the bay. Dealers in Banko ware, curious stones from Mino\r\nand fans from Nagoya came flocking in, and the evening was passed in\r\nbargaining.\r\n\r\nThe stage from Kuwana to Miya is by sea, across the head of the bay of\r\nOwari. Nowadays (1887) people perform the journey by steamer, but in\r\n1867 we had to content ourselves with a rather dirty boat, roofed in\r\nwith planks. We left at half-past seven and arrived at the termination\r\nof our voyage a little after eleven, but as the distance is estimated at\r\nseven ri or 17-1/2 miles, we were precluded from going further that day.\r\nI proposed, therefore, to devote the afternoon to visiting Nagoya, of\r\nwhich Miya is little more than a suburb.\r\n\r\nIt boasts a castle founded by Nobunaga towards the end of the sixteenth\r\ncentury. It is famous throughout Japan for two huge golden dolphins\r\nwhich surmount the donjon tower, and is one of the finest extant\r\nspecimens of that sort of architecture. But the foreign department\r\nofficials had no instructions to let us deviate from the high road, and\r\ndid not venture to take on themselves the responsibility for making\r\nother arrangements. They promised, of course, to see the governor of the\r\ntown, and ask him to get permission which they represented was required\r\nbefore they could take us into the castle town of a great noble like the\r\nPrince of Owari, but it was all fudge. Shopkeepers flocked in laden with\r\nfans, metal work, lacquered porcelain and crape, with which we occupied\r\nthe interval till an answer should be received from the authorities at\r\nNagoya. A report of Wirgman's skill with the brush having spread, he was\r\noverwhelmed with quantities of Chinese paper and fans which, our host\r\nsaid, had been brought by the leading inhabitants who desired specimens\r\nof his art, and I wrote mottoes to his productions. The _saké_ bottle\r\nfurnished us with the necessary inspiration. But we found out at last\r\nthat the fans thus decorated were being sold outside at an _ichibu_ a\r\npiece, and refused to be imposed on any further.\r\n\r\nIn the evening we had in some singing and dancing girls, and having got\r\nourselves up in native costume, invited the two foreign office clerks\r\nand some of our escort to join the party. One or two of the latter\r\nbecame so merry that they could not resist a temptation to perform\r\nbuffoon dancing, and Sano, the biggest and most good-humoured, gave\r\nimitations of famous actors. We did not get rid of our guests until nine\r\no'clock, by which time they had taken a good quantity of _saké_ on\r\nboard.\r\n\r\nIn passing through Arimatsu on the following day, famous for cotton\r\n_shibori_, dyed in the same way as the Indian _bandhana_, we called at\r\nthe shop where the heads of the Dutch factory at Nagasaki had been in\r\nthe habit of stopping from time immemorial on the occasion of their\r\nannual journeys to Yedo, and were shown a ledger containing records of\r\nthe purchases made by them year after year. It was a matter of\r\nobligation to follow this time-honoured example, and we selected some\r\npieces of the stuff, which oddly enough is called by the name not of the\r\nplace where it is made, but by that of the last post-town, Narumi.\r\nNoguchi and the two foreign department officials did the bargaining,\r\nwhile Wirgman and I looked on and smoked in dignified silence as if we\r\nwere utterly unconcerned about the prices. The owner of the shop was a\r\ndistinguished person, evidently invested with a municipal function, in\r\nconsequence of which he was allowed to have a few stands of matchlocks\r\nin his hall. Many of the houses were of more substantial construction\r\nthan usual, thus testifying to the prosperity conferred by the local\r\nmanufacture.\r\n\r\nAt Chiriû the landlord of the inn where we lunched came privately to\r\nNoguchi and asked him for four _ichibus_ as \"tea money,\" on the ground\r\nthat Sir R. Alcock had given that sum in 1861, but his request was\r\nrefused, and he was forced to content himself with what we had paid\r\nelsewhere, namely, half an _ichibu_. I always left such questions to his\r\ndiscretion, and have no doubt that he acted rightly. In the afternoon\r\nwhen the train stopped as usual to give the palanquin bearers a rest,\r\nthe people of the _tatéba_, or half-way tea-house, presented us with\r\nbuckwheat vermicelli, for which, as they assured us, the place was\r\nreputed famous. It was, however, inferior to what I have eaten in other\r\nplaces. Wirgman's fame having preceded him, paper, brushes and ink were\r\nbrought, and he executed a masterpiece representing us eating vermicelli\r\nand drinking _saké_ from a gourd which he had been careful to get\r\nreplenished at Miya.\r\n\r\nThe bridge over the Yahagi-gawa being broken down, we crossed the river\r\nin a ferry boat, and were met at the entrance of the town by municipal\r\nofficers and constables, the latter being furnished by the local\r\n_daimiô_, whose function was to walk at the head of the procession and\r\nto cry \"Down, down.\" Down went the whole crowd of spectators, including\r\nmen of the two-sworded class, all the more willingly perhaps because\r\nthat was the only way they had of bringing their eyes to a level with\r\nthe windows of our palanquins. For etiquette demanded that we should\r\nalways ride in entering and quitting a town, the vulgar practice of\r\nproceeding on foot being allowable only in the more countryfied portions\r\nof the highroad.\r\n\r\nThe following day opened with what promised to be persistent rain, and\r\nwe had to be fastened up in our palanquins with the oiled paper covering\r\nthrown over us; through a small opening we could just manage to see a\r\nfew yards to right and left. All day long we ploughed our way onwards\r\nalong the almost level road, which in places was flooded nearly six\r\ninches deep. At Arai there was then a guardhouse close to the shore of\r\nthe Hamana Bay, where all travellers had to alight from their palanquins\r\nand walk through, taking off their hats and shoes in order to show\r\nrespect while submitting to a searching examination. Over the _saké_ on\r\nthe preceding evening there had been a good deal of chaff about our\r\nbeing obliged to subject ourselves to this rule, which was said to admit\r\nof no exceptions. I was inwardly resolved not to submit, and was much\r\nrelieved when the time came to find that the warden was satisfied with\r\nthe _kago_ door being opened about half-way as we were carried past;\r\nthis slight concession had been arranged overnight by the foreign\r\ndepartment officers, in order that the letter of the rule enforcing\r\ninspection might be observed, and we were quite contented, as the door\r\nwas opened by a third party, so that our dignity as Europeans was duly\r\nsaved by our not having to alight.\r\n\r\nSome years ago a series of dykes and bridges exceeding a mile in length\r\nwas thrown across the shallowest part of the bay. We had, however, to\r\nembark in boats so small that they would not hold more than a single\r\n_kago_. The spits which run out towards each other at the mouth gave the\r\nbay the appearance of a landlocked lake, until we got half-way across\r\nand the breakers became visible; nevertheless the sea at the point where\r\nwe crossed was as smooth as a mirror. Two miles on the western side of\r\nHamamatsu we were met by some retainers of Inouyé Kawachi no Kami, the\r\nlocal _daimiô_, wearing black hats as flat as a pancake, who, being\r\nhimself a member of the Tycoon's Council, had no doubt given special\r\norders regarding our reception, and at the entrance of the town they\r\nwere joined by more. The procession was now formed in the following\r\norder. Two _machi-kata_, in green mantles with one in brown between\r\nthem, marched a long way ahead to clear the street, followed by a couple\r\nof aldermen (_shuku-yakunin_) in single file on each side of the road,\r\nand a couple of _seishi_ or heralds, whose fierce demeanour was\r\ndelightful to behold, who roared out _shitaniro, shitaniro_, and warned\r\nsome young _samurai_ who displayed a disposition to approach too close\r\nthat they must keep at a respectful distance. Then followed our _kagos_,\r\nwith one of the native escort (_betté-gumi_) walking on each side. Then\r\na constable (_dôshin_) carrying a spear, and behind him the rest of the\r\nescort, servants and baggage.\r\n\r\nOn arriving at the inn, we received visits from the head merchants, and\r\nwere told that we were to be specially cared for, by orders of the\r\n_daimiô_, some of whose retainers kept watch and ward in the kitchen\r\nthroughout the night, this being very spacious and situated in the front\r\nof the house. In leaving on the following day the procession was\r\narranged in the same way, and as we passed the castle gates a high\r\nofficial stationed there handed his card to one of the _betté-gumi_ to\r\npresent to me. At the end of the town the escort was changed, and we\r\nwere placed again in charge of the four black-hatted _seishi_, who did\r\nnot leave us until we arrived at the boundary of Inouye's, the\r\n_daimiô's_, territory.\r\n\r\nAfter the rain of the day before yesterday the country looked especially\r\nbeautiful; ripe fields of barley behind the rows of tall pine trees that\r\nlined the road stretched right away to the foot of the nearer hills,\r\nbehind which rose range after range in the blue distance. We met\r\nyesterday and to-day soldiers of the 3rd regiment of the Tycoon's\r\ndrilled troops marching to Kiôto to support the new policy of the head\r\nof the government, and perhaps to defend him against an armed\r\nconfederation of the leading _daimiôs_ of the west.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the local escort had turned back we descended from our\r\npalanquins to pursue our way on foot to the Tenriû-gawa, which we\r\ncrossed by means of ferry boats. The river here is very wide and the\r\ncurrent swift, and except during freshets is divided into two branches\r\nby a sandbank which occupies the middle of the stream. Wirgman had\r\nstopped behind to sketch, and I waited with one of the foreign office\r\nofficials, who confided to me that we should probably meet a \"barbáre\"\r\non the road. By this I understood the _rei-hei-shi_, a high official of\r\nthe Mikado's court who was returning from a mission to the tomb of\r\nIyéyasu at Nikkô. He was of higher rank than any Japanese _daimiô_, and\r\neveryone on meeting him had to get out of his palanquin and go down on\r\nhis knees. My informant hoped we should manage to avoid him, and I hoped\r\nso too. The rest of the party having at last come up, we proceeded by a\r\nshort cut through the fields, which saved us a couple of miles walking.\r\nWe got to Mitsuké, where we were to lunch, some time before noon. The\r\nstreets were crowded with pretty girls, who had turned out to see the\r\nforeigners. Our host, who had put on his robes of ceremony, made his\r\nappearance, bowing low and bearing a gift of dried white-bait fry, which\r\nwhen toasted and dipped in soy is very palatable. Handsome Turkish\r\ncarpets had been spread in the bedroom. Two charming little boys about\r\nten years of age, with perfect manners, were told off to wait on us.\r\n\r\nThe _rei-hei-shi_ was of course the principal topic of discussion. He\r\nhad not yet passed, and our followers were full of anxiety. Noguchi said\r\nthat all Japanese of rank, down to the lowest two-sworded man, got out\r\nof his way, because his followers were in the habit of extorting money\r\non the pretext that the proper amount of respect had not been paid to\r\nthe great man. I was quite ready to follow the example of the Japanese\r\nin avoiding if possible the chance of an encounter. We were told that\r\nthe _rei-hei-shi_, whose rank by this time had been much diminished in\r\nthe mouths of our informants, was to stop the night at Fukuroi, the very\r\nnext town, only four miles further, so we hurried away hoping to get to\r\nour own destination early in the afternoon. Two miles over the\r\ntableland, then zig-zag down a beautiful hill covered with pine trees,\r\nthen two more over the rice field flat to Fukuroi, where we changed the\r\npalanquin and baggage porters and hastened on without stopping.\r\n\r\nTo-day, the 27th of May, the peasants were cutting barley and planting\r\nout the young rice. I did the six miles more to Kakégawa in two hours,\r\nincluding the last stoppage, which was considered very quick going. A\r\nyoung Satsuma man who was on his way to Nagasaki called at our inn and\r\ngave me an account of the _rei-hei-shi_ and the doings of his retainers,\r\nfor whom he professed the greatest contempt. He said they were wretched\r\ncitizens of Kiôto hired for the occasion, and dressed in a little brief\r\nauthority. At Shinagawa, the last suburb of Yedo, they had seized\r\neighteen people and fined them for exhibiting a want of respect towards\r\nthe Mikado's messenger. It was rumoured that he would pass through about\r\nsix o'clock, and spend the night at Fukuroi. Six o'clock came, but no\r\n_rei-hei-shi_; we passed the evening in expectation, and went to bed;\r\nstill no _rei-hei-shi_.\r\n\r\nWirgman and I slept in separate rooms, Noguchi in a third, and all the\r\nescort but one were quartered at another house a little way off. At a\r\nquarter past one I was roused from sleep by a Japanese saying to me:\r\n\"Mr. Satow, Mr. Satow, get your sword; they've come.\" My sword was an\r\nold cavalry sabre, not good for much but to make a show. I got up and\r\ngroped my way through the black darkness to the sword-stand in the\r\nalcove and got the weapon. The Japanese led me by the hand, and we stood\r\ntogether in a corner of the next room, wondering what was going to\r\nhappen. He said: \"I wish the escort would come.\" Meanwhile violent\r\nnoises were heard, as if of people breaking in. Bewildered by the\r\ndarkness, I imagined them to be coming from the little garden at the\r\nback, on to which my bedroom looked. We remained still and breathless.\r\nIn three minutes all was silent again, and I heard a voice cry \"Mr.\r\nSatow.\" It was Noguchi, who appeared with a light, and reported that the\r\nenemy had fled. Wirgman and my chancery servant Yokichi were nowhere to\r\nbe found. The Japanese who had woke me proved to be Matsushita, the\r\nyoungest of the escort. We proceeded then towards Noguchi's room; the\r\nwooden door opposite was lying on the floor, where the assailants had\r\nbroken in. As we stood in the passage, others of the escort came in, all\r\ndressed in fighting mantles, with drawn swords in their hands and\r\nwearing iron forehead pieces. Seeing my scarlet sleeping trousers, they\r\nbegged me either to hide myself or take them off, but the danger being\r\npast, I only laughed at them. Two of them went in search of Wirgman, and\r\nfound him in an alley leading to the back of the house; they narrowly\r\nescaped being shot.\r\n\r\nWe began to feel cooler, and Noguchi narrated what had happened. He\r\nheard the noise of the front door being broken down, jumped up, tied his\r\ngirdle, and stood in the doorway of his room, a sword in the right hand,\r\na revolver in the left. Some men approached and asked for the\r\n\"barbarians,\" to which he replied that if they would only come in, he\r\nwould give the \"barbarians\" to them. They took fright at his attitude\r\nand determined tone, and fled. Altogether there were, he thought, about\r\na dozen, two armed with long swords, the rest with short ones. On\r\nlooking about, we discovered that the mosquito nets in the room diagonal\r\nto Wirgman's had been cut to pieces, the occupants having escaped. It\r\nwas lucky for us that we had put out the lamps before going to bed, so\r\nthat the assailants could not find their way.\r\n\r\nWirgman explained that on being awakened by the noise of people breaking\r\ndown the doors and shouting for the \"barbarians,\" he followed the people\r\nof the house, who took to their heels. A lantern that had been dropped\r\nby one of the \"ruffians\" led to the conclusion that they belonged to the\r\n_rei-hei-shi_'s suite. No one was hurt, except one of the assailants,\r\nwho in the hurry-scurry of running away was accidentally wounded by a\r\ncompanion. After everyone had related his own experiences, I retired to\r\nbed, while Wirgman called for _saké_ and sliced raw fish, with which he\r\nand the escort regaled themselves until daylight.\r\n\r\nOn getting up in the morning my first step was to send for the two\r\nforeign office officials, and endeavour to obtain redress through them.\r\nThe escort, who had not appeared on the scene till the danger was past,\r\nwere now very anxious to distinguish themselves by some act of valour. I\r\ntold the officials, with the full support of the escort, that they\r\nshould either get the guilty men delivered up to me, or that I would go\r\nwith my escort and take them by force. This was the attitude maintained\r\nuntil mid-day. I verily believe that if I had given the signal, the\r\nescort would have attacked the _rei-hei-shi's_ lodgings. At last the\r\nofficial came back and said that the _rei-hei-shi's_ people refused to\r\ngive the men up to me; as an alternative they proposed to obtain a\r\nwritten apology, coupled with a promise to punish the assailants on\r\ntheir reaching Kiôto. To this I expressed my willingness to assent, in\r\nthe hope that we should be able to pursue our journey before night set\r\nin. But the negotiations lingered, and this was not to be. So we sent\r\nfor some musicians, and invited the two officials and the escort to a\r\nbanquet. Wirgman and one of the escort entertained the company with\r\ndancing. Another of the escort got very drunk, and begged me to take him\r\ninto my personal service on the same terms as Noguchi. We heard that the\r\ntownspeople were delighted at the _rei-hei-sh_i and his blackguards\r\nbeing so bothered by a couple of foreigners. No Mikado's messenger was\r\never before stopped on his road and talked to in our imperious manner.\r\nFour or five of the escort, when full of _saké_, started up the street\r\nin their fighting mantles and created great alarm in the minds of the\r\n_rei-hei-shi's_ retainers, who, thinking they were to be attacked in\r\nearnest, begged for a guard from the _daimiô_ of the town. The captain\r\nof the escort and two others in particular behaved in a delightfully\r\nswaggering manner. But in spite of all this, nothing was settled, and we\r\nhad to stop a second night.\r\n\r\nOn the following morning on getting up, I was told that matters were\r\nnearly arranged, that the men who had attacked our lodgings were to be\r\nleft behind in the custody of the _daimiô_, the people at the castle\r\ngiving a receipt on his behalf. The morning wore on without the desired\r\ndocument making its appearance, and I feared they would slip through my\r\nfingers altogether. I got tired of waiting and went to sleep, from which\r\nI was awakened by one of the foreign office officials, who had been\r\nacting as go-between, bringing me a certified copy, signed by the\r\ngovernor of the town, of a written undertaking given by a leading\r\nretainer of the _rei-hei-shi_ to remain there with three of the\r\nassailants. Another copy was given to him, and he started at once for\r\nOzaka with it, accompanied by one of the escort. I was now asked whether\r\nI would permit the _rei-hei-shi_ to depart, to which I gave my assent.\r\nWe saw him and his retinue pass the inn; there were two large\r\npalanquins, half-a-dozen smaller ones, and about fifty ruffianly-looking\r\nfellows in green coats. We had thus remained on the field of victory. As\r\nsoon as the _rei-hei-shi_ was clear of the place, we started in the\r\nopposite direction about three o'clock in the afternoon. The _daimiô's_\r\npeople offered to give us a body of men to escort us out of the town,\r\nbut I replied that my escort was sufficient to ensure our safety. A\r\nguard of honour was drawn up in front of the inn as we left, and eight\r\npolicemen accompanied us to the exit of the town.\r\n\r\nUltimately, some months later, these men and three others implicated in\r\nthe affair were brought to Yedo and put on their trial. Two were\r\ncondemned to death, and four more to transportation to an island. Sir\r\nHarry wanted me to be present at the execution of these two men, but I\r\npersuaded him to send some one else instead. To look on at the execution\r\nof men who have tried to take one's life would have borne an appearance\r\nof revengefulness, which one would not have liked. But I think that\r\nunder the circumstances of those times the punishment was rightly\r\ninflicted.\r\n\r\nOur next stage was to Nissaka, a pretty little town lying in a basin of\r\nhills. Beyond rose a steep ascent, which we climbed not without fatigue,\r\nto find ourselves on the top of a tableland running away to the sea on\r\nour right, while on the left hills rose ever higher and higher above the\r\nroad, being cultivated up to their summits in tiny level plots cut out\r\nof their sides. At the highest point of the road we rested at a\r\ntea-house, where a kind of soft rice cake, bedaubed with a substance\r\nresembling extract of malt, was served to us by a diminutive girl.\r\nThough fifteen years of age, and consequently nearly full grown, she did\r\nnot measure four feet in height.\r\n\r\nOn the further side of the tableland lay Kanaya, the next post-town, and\r\nbeyond that the Oi-gawa, which had to be crossed before we could gain\r\nour stopping place for the night. A hundred naked porters hurried\r\nforward to carry our palanquins and baggage to the other bank. For\r\nourselves there were a sort of square stretcher, carried on the\r\nshoulders of twelve men for greater safety, who made a point of plunging\r\ninto the deepest part of the torrent to give us a greater idea of the\r\ndifficulties they had to contend with. For the idea then entertained by\r\nevery Japanese was that the force of the stream was too great for a boat\r\nto live in it, and that a bridge was impossible. As it has since been\r\nsuccessfully bridged, the probability is that this belief was purposely\r\ninculcated on the people on the principle of _divide et impera_, and\r\nwhat more effectual means of division could be found than a river which\r\nwas not to be passed but by taking off your clothes and running the risk\r\nof drowning in it while effecting the passage, to say nothing of the\r\ninconvenience of emerging half-naked on the other side; that is to say,\r\nunless you could pay to be carried.\r\n\r\nFollowing the economical practice we had observed all along of limiting\r\nour tips to the smallest respectable sum, we threw a _bu_ to the men,\r\nwho clamoured loudly for its division, the share of each being somewhat\r\nover 2/3 of a penny. We did not get to the inn till eight o'clock. Our\r\nhost was particularly polite, and thanked us profoundly for doing him\r\nthe honour of stopping at his humble abode. We were still under the\r\ninfluence of the excitement produced by our recent adventures, so _saké_\r\nand fish were ordered in, and the liveliest of the escort were bidden to\r\nthe feast. Some one distinguished himself by adding a new verse to the\r\npopular ballad then in vogue, expressive of our contempt for the\r\n\"turnip-top\" coated retainers of the _rei-hei-shi_, which was sung over\r\nand over again to the accompaniment of a lute played by an exceedingly\r\nugly red faced damsel who waited on us.\r\n\r\nThe next day brought us to the large town of Fuchiû, formerly the\r\nresidence of Iyéyasu after his retirement from the active government of\r\nthe state early in the seventeenth century, and since re-christened\r\nShidzuoka. It is an important centre of the tea and paper trades, and at\r\nthe time we passed through was the seat of one of the principal\r\nuniversities of Japan, but greatly fallen from its ancient grandeur. On\r\nour way we had to taste various local delicacies, among which was a\r\nhorribly tenacious kind of gruel, resembling bird-lime in appearance,\r\nmade from the powdered root of the Dioscorea japonica, a species of wild\r\npotato. We found the streets so full of spectators that it became\r\nnecessary to get into our palanquins to avoid the crush of curious\r\nsightseers. The town is also noted for a variety of articles of cabinet\r\nwork and lacquered ware of the ordinary sort, and the room next to our\r\napartment had been converted into a kind of bazaar in expectation of our\r\narrival. The articles were of the class common enough at Yokohama, and\r\nnot much cheaper; in fact the prices were such as befitted the supposed\r\nexalted rank of the travellers. In those days in Japan it was a well\r\nobserved doctrine that \"noblesse oblige\" in the matter of payments.\r\n\r\nNext morning when we rose at six, we got a beautiful view of Fuji, the\r\n\"Peerless One,\" springing from the ground as it seemed almost behind the\r\ninn, and lifting its beautiful head into the pale blue sky, above\r\nhorizontal wreaths and stretches of cloud. After breakfast we paid a\r\nvisit to the \"university,\" where we found about thirty youngsters seated\r\non the floor in one room, with copies of some Chinese classic before\r\nthem, learning to read by rote from the mouths of older and more\r\nadvanced pupils. This instruction was given for about two hours each\r\nmorning, and six times a month explanations of the text were imparted by\r\nprofessors. The headmaster, who was from the Confucian College at Yedo,\r\nused to be changed annually. And this, with the addition of learning to\r\nwrite with a brush, constituted the education of a young Japanese in the\r\nolden time. The system was one that cultivated the memory, but failed\r\naltogether to appeal to the reasoning faculties. Of course all this has\r\nlong ago disappeared, and it is possible that this system of instruction\r\nis as obsolete in Japan as the dodo.\r\n\r\nThe great mountain having at last appeared on our horizon, we were to\r\nhave its company for nearly every step of the rest of the journey. Near\r\nEjiri we caught a delicious view of the summit appearing over the lower\r\nmountains on the left hand. At one o'clock we reached Okitsu, where we\r\nwere to lunch. The inn stood close to the sea shore, and possessed an\r\nupper room commanding a magnificent view, in favour of which we\r\nabandoned the dignified glories of the _jô-dan_ or dais. On the left the\r\nblue promontory of Idzu stretched away far into the ocean until it\r\nbecame almost invisible in the haze; on the right hand the low hills of\r\nKunô-zan terminating in a low spit of sand covered with irregular growth\r\nof pine trees, the famous Miyo no Matsubara of the Japanese poets. From\r\nthe back window we had a glimpse of the snowy peak of Fuji peeping over\r\nthe tops of the intervening hills, and by craning our necks out sideways\r\nthe double-topped head of the Futagoyama near Hakoné.\r\n\r\nOn leaving this spot, which we did with reluctance, we followed the base\r\nof the cliffs for two or three miles along the shore, when suddenly we\r\nturned a corner and Fuji came full in view; in front, the base of the\r\ngreat mountain was hidden by the low range which runs down into the sea\r\nnear Kambara, and a white cloud encircled its middle. Wirgman sat down\r\nto make a sketch, from which he painted a picture which is still in my\r\npossession. Next we reached Kurazawa, famous for Venus-ear (_awabi_) and\r\n_sazai_, a big whorl with a curious spiral operculum. Of course we\r\nrested here awhile to eat of the local dish, washed down with repeated\r\ncups of _saké_, in which the guard joined us. Since the affair of\r\nKakégawa we had become great friends, as men usually do who have shared\r\nthe same perils. The road followed the sea-shore here to Kambara, and\r\nwould be one of the most picturesque in Japan, but for the dirty\r\nuninteresting fishing villages which line nearly the whole of its\r\nlength.\r\n\r\nNext morning we were astir early, and crossing the low intervening\r\nhills, reached the banks of the Fuji kawa at eight o'clock. Extensive\r\npreparations had been made at the official hotel for our reception, mats\r\nlaid down to the entrance and red blankets spread on the floor of the\r\ndais. At the urgent entreaty of the innkeeper we turned in for a few\r\nminutes, and discovered that Wirgman was an ancient acquaintance of our\r\nhost, having seen him when he travelled overland from Nagasaki to Yedo\r\nin 1861 in the suite of Sir Rutherford Alcock. We were shown into the\r\nbest room with much ceremony, and when we had taken our seats on the\r\nfloor, piled-up boxes (_jû-bako_) were brought in full of chestnut meal\r\ncakes, the speciality of the village, with a bit of pickled radish on\r\nthe top. Other \"famous things\" sold here are ink stones, bits of crystal\r\nwith green streaks in them supposed by the common people to be grass,\r\nalso agates. We crossed in a boat the narrow turbulent Fuji kawa,\r\nrunning between wide beds of shingle. Nowadays you cross in the train.\r\nWe then had a view of Fuji almost rising out of the sea and drawing its\r\nskirts up gradually behind it, curious but not so beautiful as when it\r\nis partly concealed by lesser summits which afford a standard of\r\ncomparison. It looks in fact more like an exaggerated molehill than\r\nanything else.\r\n\r\nWe met on the road two little boys of twelve and fourteen years of age,\r\nwho, having begged their way as pilgrims all the way from Yedo to the\r\nsacred temples of Isé and of Kompira in Sanuki, were now on their way\r\nhome, carrying slung across their backs huge packages of temple charms\r\ndone up in oiled paper. The road was terribly sandy and hot, and passing\r\nfor the most part between the bamboo fences of cottagers' gardens, was\r\nthe reverse of picturesque.\r\n\r\nWe had intended to sleep at Hakoné, but owing to delays for sketching,\r\nto say nothing of a huge feast of broiled eels and _saké_ at\r\nKashiwabara, did not manage to get beyond Mishima, at the western foot\r\nof the hills.\r\n\r\nNext morning we started at half-past six to ascend the pass which climbs\r\nthe range of mountains by an excellent road paved with huge stones after\r\nthe manner of the Via Appia where it leaves Rome at the Forum, and lined\r\nwith huge pine trees and cryptomerias. At a tiny hamlet more than\r\nhalfway up some hunters came to present us with eggs, according to\r\nimmemorial custom. Three hours brought us to Hakoné, the little mountain\r\nvillage standing on the southern border of the lake, surrounded by steep\r\ngrassy hills. The warmth of the day tempted me to take a bath in the\r\nlake, which at first was strenuously opposed by the foreign official\r\nwith us. It appeared that no boats were allowed on the lake, nor was any\r\none permitted to swim in it, lest he should take the opportunity of\r\nswimming round at the back of the barrier gate, and so avoid the\r\nnecessity of showing his passport. With considerable trouble I persuaded\r\nthe objector to withdraw his opposition, by representing that my\r\nnatatory powers were altogether insufficient for the purpose.\r\n\r\nAfter a couple of hours spent in this charming spot, which nowadays has\r\nbecome a fashionable summer retreat of foreigners residing at Yokohama,\r\nwe resumed our journey down the eastern side of the pass, already\r\ndescribed in a previous chapter, and got to our inn at Odawara by five,\r\nlittle dreaming of what lay before me.\r\n\r\nA letter from Sir Harry Parkes was at once delivered to me urging me to\r\nhasten my return, as there were important negotiations on foot. On\r\nconferring with the leader of the escort, I learnt that by starting at\r\nonce and travelling post-haste through the night, I might get to Yedo\r\nnext morning. Eight porters in relays of four would be able to carry the\r\npalanquin at the rate of about four miles an hour. So the men were\r\nordered without delay. The Japanese on these occasions, to save\r\nthemselves from being too severely shaken, wind a broad piece of cotton\r\ncloth tightly round the waist, and tie another piece round the temples.\r\nA third is suspended from the ceiling of the palanquin, to which the\r\ntraveller clings with might and main. I had to adopt this arrangement,\r\nand in addition stuffed my palanquin full of bedding and pillows.\r\nNoguchi and two of the escort accompanied me to negotiate the changes of\r\ncoolies at the various posting stations on the way, and by seven o'clock\r\nwe were in motion. The porters maintained a constant crying \"eeya-oy,\"\r\n\"eeya-oy,\" in order to keep step with each other and render the swinging\r\nof the palanquin less unendurable. To sleep was impossible, as this\r\nnoise continued all night. When the day broke we had done twenty-six\r\nmiles, which was slower than I had expected. So we urged on the fresh\r\nmen we got here, and accomplished the remaining twenty-two miles by ten\r\no'clock. From sitting cross-legged so many hours I was almost unable to\r\nstand upright when I got to the Legation. And the vexatious part of it\r\nall was that the important conference, which I had hurried to be present\r\nat, turned out to be a mere complimentary visit of a crowd of officials\r\nfor whom anyone could easily have interpreted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XIX\r\n\r\n          SOCIAL INTERCOURSE WITH JAPANESE OFFICIALS--VISIT TO\r\n                  NIIGATA, SADO GOLD MINES, AND NANAO\r\n\r\n\r\nOUR relations with government officials suddenly from this time onward\r\nassumed a character of cordiality which formerly would have been thought\r\nimpossible. This was, of course, in consequence of very explicit\r\ninstructions given by the Tycoon to his ministers to cultivate the\r\nfriendship of the foreign missions, and especially of the British\r\nLegation, in order doubtless to counteract the intimate intercourse\r\nwhich was known to be carried on between ourselves and the retainers of\r\nSatsuma and Chôshiû. Each of the commissioners for foreign affairs in\r\nturn invited me to dine with him in Japanese fashion, and as I was\r\nextremely ignorant of Japanese etiquette, Noguchi used to accompany me\r\non these occasions to be my tutor. An exchange of presents was always an\r\nimportant part of the entertainment, and this was a very troublesome\r\nbusiness on account of the difficulty of buying anything at the foreign\r\nstores in Yokohama that was worth giving away as a specimen of English\r\nproductions. Most of these officials lived in a very modest way. The\r\nrooms in which they gave their entertainments were usually upstairs,\r\nperhaps not more than twelve feet by fifteen, but as there was no\r\nfurniture, there was plenty of space. On arriving at the house we were\r\nshown up a very narrow staircase, and through an equally narrow door.\r\nDown we plumped on our knees immediately, and bowed our heads to the\r\nmats to the host, who did the same. Then ensued a contest of politeness,\r\nour entertainer trying to get us nearer to the top of the room, and we\r\nprotesting that we were very comfortable where we were. Of course it\r\nended in my being put down in front of the recess (_tokonoma_), which is\r\nthe seat of honour, while Noguchi remained where he was, just inside the\r\ndoor. Usually I was then allowed to cross my legs in tailor fashion,\r\nowing to my joints not having yet acquired the lissomness of the\r\nJapanese. Then Noguchi with great solemnity unwrapping the present,\r\nwould slide across the floor and deposit it between the host and myself.\r\nIn Japan you don't use brown paper for parcels, but every household\r\npossesses a set of cloths of different sizes, silk or crape for the\r\nsmaller, of cotton dyed green for the larger, which fulfil the same\r\npurpose as paper. Then I pushed the present gently towards my\r\nentertainer, saying \"This is really a very shabby article, but as it is\r\na production of my contemptible country, I ...\" To which he would reply,\r\n\"Really I am quite overpowered. What a magnificent article. I am really\r\nashamed to deprive you of it.\" And then all women folk, the servants,\r\nand the children who were peeping in at the door or round the corner of\r\nthe balcony which ran along the front of the room would crane out their\r\nnecks to get a glimpse of the precious rarity from the far west. Then\r\nthe other guests, three or four in number, would begin to arrive. If\r\nthey were strangers, the following dialogue would take place. Each\r\nperson putting his hands together on the mat in front would bend over\r\nand almost touching them with his forehead, say \"I have the honour to\r\npresent myself to you for the first time. My name is so-and-so. I hope\r\nto enjoy your friendship in perpetuity.\" To which either may add that he\r\nhas often heard of the great fame of the other, and longed for an\r\nopportunity of meeting him.\r\n\r\nWhen these bowings and prostrations are over, a small apparatus for\r\nsmoking is brought in and placed before the guest, after which tea and\r\nsweetmeats are served. Perhaps an hour passes in this way, for the\r\nentertainment is provided from a restaurant, as the domestic who\r\nperforms the office of cook in a household only knows how to boil rice\r\nand make commonplace stews; and in those days at least neither clocks\r\nnor punctuality were common. If you were invited for two o'clock, you\r\nwent most often at one or three, or perhaps later. In fact, as the\r\nJapanese hour altered in length every fortnight, it was very difficult\r\nto be certain about the time of day, except at sunrise, noon, sunset and\r\nmidnight. At last you began to hear a gentle clatter of dishes below\r\nstairs; the teacups, cakes and sweetmeats were removed, and a covered\r\nlacquered basin was set before you on a square tray, with a pair of\r\nchopsticks, the ends of which were neatly wrapped in paper. At the same\r\ntime a girl put a basin half full of water down on the middle of the\r\nfloor, with a small pile of diminutive flat cups by the side. Your host\r\ntook one of these, held it out for a little of the hot _saké_, which is\r\npoured from a slender porcelain bottle, and having drunk it, slid\r\nforward to the basin to wash it. Having well shaken it, he crawled to\r\nwhere you were sitting, bowed profoundly, and presented the cup to you\r\non his crossed palms. You bowed, and taking the cup between your own two\r\nhands deposited it on the floor, after which you were bound at once to\r\npresent it to the damsel to be filled for yourself.\r\n\r\nIf your host, or one of the guests who has offered you the cup, wished\r\nto be very polite indeed, he waited before you with his hands resting on\r\nthe floor in front of him while you emptied the cup, or at least took a\r\ngood sip. When this ceremony had been gone through with all the guests,\r\nyour host lifted the cover off his soup-basin, and invited you at the\r\nsame time to follow his example. You drank a little of the soup, just\r\ndipped the end of the chopsticks into it by way of pretending to touch\r\nthe meat, and laid down the bowl again; usually you replaced the cover.\r\nA number of dishes were brought in piled up with fish-cake, white beans\r\nboiled with sugar, raw, broiled and boiled fish, perhaps some boiled\r\nfowl or roast wild duck, cut up in small pieces, and these were served\r\non small plates or saucers, and each person received a bowl containing a\r\nsort of pudding made of eggs, loach and the large seeds of the\r\nmaidenhair tree. The raw fish, which was usually either _bonito_ or\r\nsole, was sliced up very thin, and eaten with soy, raw laver (seaweed)\r\nand grated _wasabi_, which is the root of a plant belonging to the same\r\norder as the horse-radish, and resembling it in taste.\r\n\r\nTowards the end of the feast a second water _souché_ was brought in, and\r\nperhaps some broiled eels. The courses were not removed as each\r\nsucceeding one was brought in, and the plates collected on your tray and\r\nthe floor close by you till all the extent of the feast was exhibited.\r\nYou ate very little, picking here a mouthful, there a mouthful, but you\r\ndrank as much _saké_ as you could stand, and sometimes more. After two\r\nor three hours of conversation, perhaps enlivened by some music and\r\nsinging performed by professionals hired for the occasion, and you felt\r\nthat you had had enough liquor you bowed to your host, and said that you\r\nwould like some rice. This was the well-understood signal. A fresh tray\r\nwas brought in with a large lacquered bowl for rice, and a couple more\r\ncontaining soups, accompanied almost invariably by the fish of ceremony\r\ncalled sea-bream, and the bigger it was the greater the honour. You had\r\nyour bowl filled with rice, of which you were, however, not able to eat\r\nmuch, as your appetite had been nearly destroyed by the repeated\r\nlibations of warm _saké_, so after a few mouthfuls you handed the bowl\r\nto the maid, who filled it half full of very weak tea, or on very formal\r\noccasions with hot water, and thus you managed to swallow the contents,\r\naided by a piece of salted radish or vegetable marrow pickled in the\r\nlees of _saké_. That over, you carefully replaced the covers on their\r\nrespective bowls, pushed the tray a foot or two away from you, and\r\nexecuted a bow of profound gratitude to your entertainer. The feast was\r\nthen removed downstairs, where all the portable parts of it were packed\r\ninto a box of white wood-shavings and delivered to your servant, if you\r\nhad one in your train, to carry home. Freshly infused tea was brought\r\nin, after which you thanked your host for the feast, and took your\r\nleave, being accompanied to the door of the house by the whole family,\r\nto whom you made as low a bow as possible before mounting your pony or\r\nentering your palanquin.\r\n\r\nFor the next six or seven weeks we were very busy arranging with the\r\nJapanese the details of a scheme for organizing their navy, with the\r\nassistance of a body of English officers who were to be sent out from\r\nEngland, as a counterpoise to the French Military Mission, which had\r\nbeen at work since the beginning of the year, and for the establishment\r\nof a college to be superintended by a body of graduates from English\r\nUniversities. The former plan was successfully carried out, and some\r\nmonths later a mission under the command of Commander, now Admiral,\r\nRichard Tracey, arrived in Japan. The educational proposal, however,\r\ncame to nothing. Ultimately the Japanese obtained the assistance of a\r\nleading American missionary residing at Nagasaki, and the present (in\r\n1885) educational system was in fact established by teachers from the\r\nUnited States.\r\n\r\nSir Harry, as I have said before, had already visited Tsuruga, which was\r\nsuggested as a possible alternative to Niigata as the port to be opened\r\non the west coast, but before deciding this question, it was necessary\r\nto make a careful examination of Niigata itself. So in the latter part\r\nof July he started off on a voyage of inspection, taking Mitford and\r\nmyself with him. I had Ono Seigorô, one of the legation writers, and my\r\ntrusty Noguchi with me. We left Yokohama on the 23rd July in the\r\n\"Basilisk,\" commanded by Captain, afterwards Sir William, Hewett, V.C.\r\nIn less than four days we reached Hakodaté, where the usual visits were\r\nexchanged with the governor, a little dark-faced man named Koidé Yamato\r\nno Kami. A good deal was said about the coal mine at Iwanai on the west\r\ncoast of Yezo, at which a commencement of working had recently been made\r\nunder the superintendence of my friend Erasmus Gower. Admiral Keppel was\r\nalready here in the yacht \"Salamis,\" and on the 1st August we left again\r\nfor Niigata, arriving there after a prosperous voyage of thirty-six\r\nhours.\r\n\r\nFrom the sea the view of Niigata is very fine. In the background the\r\nmountains of Aidzu rise at some distance inland, stretching far away to\r\nright and left. In front lies a level plain, consisting mainly of rice\r\nfields, fringed with trees. The foreground is a sandy shore, rising into\r\nsandhills to the right of the river mouth, and at some distance to the\r\nwest the prospect terminates in the lofty peaks of Yahiko yama. I landed\r\nimmediately with Dr Wilson of the \"Basilisk,\" and the sea being quite\r\nsmooth we crossed the bar without difficulty. Inside the water is very\r\ndeep, and some eighty junks were lying there at anchor. The town is\r\nsituated a little way up the river, not quite close to the bank. We\r\nchose what seemed a convenient landing-place, and pushed ashore.\r\nImmediately a number of two-sworded officials made their appearance, and\r\nforming themselves into an escort, led the way to a Buddhist temple, the\r\nreception rooms of which had been prepared for the use of foreigners.\r\n\r\nAfter we had waited for a few minutes the governor came in; he proved to\r\nbe Shiraishi Shimôsa no Kami, an old acquaintance of mine when he held a\r\nsimilar post at Yokohama in 1864 and 1865. In those days we used often\r\nto have serious disputes about the claims of British subjects against\r\ndefaulting Japanese merchants and questions of customs' duties, but I\r\nfound him now in quite a different mood. He was very polite and cheery,\r\nand alluded with regret to the ridiculous arguments which in former days\r\nunder a different régime he had been obliged to maintain against me. Now\r\nthat the foreign ministers had visited the Tycoon at Ozaka all was to be\r\nchanged, and our intercourse was to be really friendly. He had himself\r\nreceived from Kiôto a copy of instructions to that effect. After some\r\nfurther talk about the possibility of Niigata being made an open port, I\r\narranged for him to call on Sir Harry on the following morning on board\r\nthe \"Basilisk,\" bringing all the maps in his possession, and took my\r\nleave.\r\n\r\nOn our way back to the ship we stopped at a new hotel, where we dined in\r\nJapanese fashion, and made some purchases of the curious lacquered\r\narticles called _mokusa-nuri_, which are manufactured in Aidzu, and\r\nChina grass cloth woven in the villages further inland. This was not to\r\nbe had in the shops, but was hawked about the town by people from the\r\ncountry. Here for the first time I saw the frozen snow, which in those\r\ndays was the Japanese substitute for ice, and we found it a great luxury\r\nat that season of the year. Niigata was laid out in the form of the\r\ntruncated segment of a circle, and intersected by canals, the banks of\r\nwhich were lined with willow trees, suggesting a Dutch model. The\r\ncanals, however, were narrow and dirty, and better deserving perhaps the\r\nname of ditches. At this moment the feast of Tanabata was at hand, and\r\nthe streets were crowded with little boys carrying paper lanterns of all\r\nsizes and colours, many of them adorned with clever sketches in colour\r\nrepresenting Japanese historical traditions and popular customs.\r\n\r\nOn the following day the promised interview came off on board, and we\r\nreturned the governor's visit in the afternoon at his official\r\nresidence. He had hastily had some benches constructed, which were\r\ncovered with red cloth, the best substitute procurable for\r\nleather-bottom chairs.\r\n\r\nOld Shiraishi renewed acquaintance with me some twelve years later at\r\nTôkiô, and used to give me lessons in the interpretation of the _utai_\r\nplays; his son became my librarian, and died in my house.\r\n\r\nAfter a two hours' talk we started off to inspect an island in the river\r\nwhich it was proposed should be converted to the uses of a foreign\r\nsettlement. Sir Harry, who was of an active inquisitive temperament,\r\nhere signalized himself in the eyes of the natives by scrambling up to\r\nthe top of a large shed, under which a junk was in course of\r\nconstruction, to get a view of the surrounding country, much to the\r\nhorror of Mitford and myself, who were so orientalized by this time in\r\nour notions that we longed to see our chief conduct himself with the\r\nimpassive dignity of a Japanese gentleman. This exploit being over, he\r\ndragged us all, including Hewett, about the town till half-past six, not\r\nto the improvement of the tempers of that gallant officer or of his\r\nboat's crew, who thus lost their dinner. I remained behind with Noguchi,\r\ndined again in Japanese fashion, and spent the night on shore, in the\r\nenjoyment of a few hours' perfect freedom. In fact, I did not return to\r\nthe ship till the following afternoon, and then had some difficulty in\r\ngetting off, as there was a heavy swell on the bar, though outside there\r\nwas neither wind nor rough sea.\r\n\r\nFrom Niigata we crossed over to the island of Sado, the site of gold\r\nmines that have for a long period been famous. The Japanese proverb is\r\nthat the \"soil of Sado is the most effective of love-philtres.\" We had\r\nbeen told by the governor of Niigata that there was a good port here,\r\nwhere foreign vessels could lie, when the bar at the mouth of the\r\nShinano River was too rough to cross owing to the northwest winds that\r\nprevail during the winter.\r\n\r\nA letter had been sent off from Niigata on the previous day to announce\r\nthe visit of the British Minister, and as soon as we let go our anchor\r\nsome of the local officials came off to call. The mines however lay at\r\nAikawa on the other side of the island, where the governor resided. He\r\nhad sent over his own _kago_ for Sir Harry to perform the journey in,\r\nbut the chief did not relish either the idea of locomotion after this\r\nfashion, nor yet of walking across the island and of passing the night\r\non the floor of a Japanese house in native quilts, and with nothing\r\nbetter than rice and fish to eat. So he decided to send me across in his\r\nstead, and proceeded round to Aikawa in the \"Basilisk.\" This arrangement\r\nsuited me down to the ground. It was much jollier to travel by one's\r\nself than to play second fiddle to one's chief always. The distance was\r\nabout sixteen miles to Aikawa, and the officials made me extremely\r\ncomfortable for the night.\r\n\r\nNext day Sir Harry and a large party, including some of the officers of\r\nthe \"Serpent,\" Commander Bullock and W. G. Aston our interpreter, landed\r\nat Sawané, where I went to meet them, and we walked over the hills to\r\nthe village near the mines, where I had put up. On his arrival at the\r\nhouse where I had lodged, which in fact had been prepared for his\r\nreception, one of those scenes occurred which were not infrequent in\r\nthose days, when the Japanese tried to treat foreigners with indignity,\r\nand it became necessary to resent their impertinence. At the door he was\r\nmet by one of two vice-governors, who ushered him into a side room,\r\nwhere the idea was that he should do \"ante-chamber\" till the governor\r\ndeigned to receive him. But Sir Harry was equal to the occasion, and\r\npromptly turning round without saying a word, walked out of the house. I\r\novertook him at the gate, and having found out what was the matter, was\r\non my way back to tell the alarmed officials that the governor must\r\nreceive the British Minister at the door of the house, when I met the\r\ntwo vice-governors hurrying after us with some ridiculous excuse. So we\r\nturned back, walking with immense dignity so as to give him time, and by\r\nthe time we arrived back again the old fellow made his appearance\r\nbeaming with smiles, as if nothing had happened. He was at once\r\nforgiven, and led the way into a large room where a long row of chairs\r\nextended down one side for ourselves, faced by three others for himself\r\nand the vice-governors.\r\n\r\nWe speedily became great friends and drank a quantity of _saké_\r\ntogether, Sir Harry and the governor vying with each other in the\r\nmanufacture of the most high-flown compliments. After this the whole\r\nparty adjourned to visit the gold mines, which were then, whatever they\r\nmay be now, low-roofed burrows half full of water, and those who\r\nventured in returned to the outer air again looking more like\r\nhalf-drowned rabbits than human Englishmen. I had never been able to see\r\nmuch pleasure in this sort of subterranean excursion, and carefully\r\nstayed outside. We got on board that night, and weighed anchor in order\r\nto proceed to Nanao in Noto. There a fine harbour was said to exist,\r\nwhich we thought could perhaps be substituted for Niigata.\r\n\r\nEarly on the morning of the 7th August we came in sight of the lofty\r\nmountains of Etchiû, which centre round the volcanic peak of Tatéyama,\r\nnearly 10,000 feet high, and at eleven o'clock reached the southern\r\nentrance of the harbour, which is formed by a considerable island lying\r\nopposite to a bay. The \"Serpent\" led the way, in discharge of the\r\nfunctions appertaining to her as a surveying ship, but we had to take\r\ngreat care on account of the numerous patches of shoal water, and did\r\nnot come to an anchor in front of the town till half-past twelve. Nanao,\r\nor Tokoro no kuchi, at that time containing from 8000 to 9000\r\ninhabitants, was rising into importance as a port for the few steamers\r\nbelonging to the _daimiô_ of Kaga, and was administered by a _machi\r\nbugiô_ or prefect named Abé Junjirô. He was a young man who had been to\r\nNagasaki and knew a little English, both of which facts in those days\r\ngave him a title to be considered travelled and learned, but he had no\r\nauthority to speak on behalf of his prince. We therefore waited until\r\nthe arrival of some more representative officials named Sano and Satomi,\r\nwho were expected from Kanazawa, the capital of this daimiate. They\r\nturned up on board the \"Basilisk\" on the 9th August, and sat talking, or\r\nrather being talked to, by Sir Harry for five mortal hours. The chief\r\ntopic was the question of the suitability of Nanao as a substitute for\r\nNiigata. What the Kaga people feared was that this would lead to its\r\nbeing taken away from them by the Tycoon's government, as in former\r\ntimes had happened in the case of Nagasaki and Niigata. But they did not\r\nventure to state this openly, and alleged therefore various other\r\nexcuses, such as that the inhabitants were not accustomed to see\r\nforeigners, that the majority would object on account of the general\r\nrise in prices which would follow on the exportation of produce, and the\r\n_daimiô_, however willing to see the place opened to foreign trade, must\r\nof course act in harmony with the wishes of the people.\r\n\r\nSir Harry then gave up pressing the point directly, enlarged on the\r\ninconveniences of the anchorage at Niigata, the need of a port of\r\nrefuge, and the \"fact\" that none existed nearer than Nanao. He said\r\nnothing of our having inspected Ebisu Minato in Sado with the view of\r\nusing it as an alternative anchorage to Niigata. Would the _daimiô_\r\nobject to foreign vessels anchoring at Nanao when the weather was bad at\r\nthe bar of Niigata. The reply was that for the sake of humanity and of\r\nour friendly relations he would be unable to refuse this. Well then, as\r\nships could not afford to lie a long time at Nanao doing nothing, would\r\nthere be any objection to their cargoes being landed and stored till\r\nthey could be transported to Niigata. No, probably not, in the interests\r\nof humanity. Who then, asked Sir Harry, should undertake the\r\nconstruction of the necessary warehouses? The reply was that either\r\nforeigners or the Kaga administration could do this as seemed most\r\nconvenient. Well then, supposing that the people of Nanao should wish to\r\nbuy any of the goods so stored by foreigners, would it not be a hard\r\nthing to prevent the sale? They said perhaps it might be, but to give\r\nsuch permission would lead to converting Nanao into a foreign trading\r\nport; nevertheless, if all the articles required were ordered\r\nbeforehand, and not selected from those stored with a view to their\r\ntransportation to Niigata, there could be no objection. But in actual\r\nfact, to speak frankly, they thought they could undertake the regulation\r\nof the port and the storage of goods without the assistance of the\r\nTycoon's government. The territory of Nanao had belonged to the Maeda\r\nclan from very early times; it was the only good port in the three\r\nprovinces of Kaga, Etchiû and Noto, and could ill be spared. They would\r\ndislike to share the local administration with the government, nor could\r\nthey give it up to them altogether.\r\n\r\nSir Harry expressed his concurrence in these views, and then proceeded\r\nto talk about the means of transport for himself and his party overland\r\nto Ozaka. This subject had been discussed in the legation before our\r\ndeparture from Yedo, though when the governor of Niigata had asked Sir\r\nHarry whether it was not his intention to return by land from Nanao, our\r\nvery diplomatic chief had replied that such an idea had never entered\r\nhis head. They received his suggestion with no marks of cordiality, and\r\ndrew on themselves a severe rebuke for their want of friendship towards\r\nforeigners, so different to the feelings displayed by certain other\r\nclans. This plain speaking completely spoiled their temper. They became\r\nvery sulky and silent, and alleging hunger, probably with much truth,\r\ntook their departure.\r\n\r\nAs soon as they had left the ship Sir Harry made up his mind to send\r\nMitford and myself overland to Ozaka, while he went round by way of\r\nNagasaki in the \"Basilisk.\" It was, of course, evident that we could\r\ntravel through the country in a much less formal style than would be\r\nnecessary for him, and on our part of course we were only too delighted\r\nto get the opportunity of seeing a part of the interior where foreigners\r\nhad never been before. I was therefore sent on shore to get hold of the\r\nprefect. Bullock was ordered to remain behind with the \"Serpent\" to make\r\na complete survey of the bay. The Admiral, who had arrived from Niigata\r\nthe day before us, got up steam in the \"Salamis,\" and was off at\r\nhalf-past three, the \"Basilisk\" following a couple of hours later.\r\n\r\nThe chief, who liked to keep us by him till the last moment, took us as\r\nfar as the entrance of the harbour, where we put our traps into a boat\r\nbelonging to the \"Serpent.\" But just as we were pulling away, the\r\n\"Basilisk\" got ashore in a shallow place, and they signalled to us to\r\nreturn to her. Eventually we were released from dancing attendance on\r\nhim, and reached the shore at eight o'clock in the evening.\r\n\r\nWe proceeded to a house where I had more than once passed the night, and\r\nshortly received a visit from Sano and Abé, who were to make all the\r\narrangements for our journey. Thither came also two officials of the\r\nYedo Foreign Department, who had come from Yokohama with Sir Harry, and\r\nwhom he had left behind with injunctions to facilitate the survey of the\r\nharbour by Bullock. But as soon as they heard that we were going\r\noverland, they conceived the plan of offering that one of them should\r\naccompany us, to spy upon our movements. They alleged that although\r\neverything might go well with us in the territories of the _daimiô_ of\r\nKaga, we should meet with difficulties further on. We should be unable\r\nto procure baggage and palanquin coolies; we might be attacked and\r\nkilled. They had instructions in fact to accompany us wherever we went\r\non shore, and that it was a law of Japan that foreigners must not travel\r\nwithout foreign department officials to look after them. To this I\r\nreplied with equal weight that they were bound to respect the\r\ninjunctions laid on them by Sir Harry, to whom they had been lent by the\r\nTycoon's Council. He had told them to remain at Nanao for a specific\r\npurpose, while we had positive orders from our chief not to take them.\r\nWe felt assured that the _daimiôs_ of Kaga and Echizen, which was the\r\nterritory that lay immediately beyond, would do everything to smooth our\r\nway; and as regarded the rest of the line of road, they might write to\r\nthe Tycoon's people at Kiôto to send down the necessary instructions,\r\nand even take on themselves the responsibility of transmitting the\r\norders direct to the authorities of the towns we should have to pass\r\nthrough.\r\n\r\nAs for the law they mentioned, I felt convinced that it had no\r\nexistence. At best there was only a custom to that effect, which we\r\ncould decline to abide by at our option. These considerations proved to\r\nthem that argument would not help them, so they tried to work upon my\r\nfeelings by representing that they would get into hot water with their\r\nsuperiors in Yedo if they suffered us to depart alone. But this also\r\nfailed. Finally they washed their hands of the business, and begged to\r\nbe excused from all responsibility for any difficulties we might\r\nencounter. This request was most readily granted, and they retired with\r\na secret intention of getting Bullock to dispense with their services,\r\nwhile we betook ourselves to our beds with the consciousness of a\r\nvictory achieved.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER XX\r\n\r\n                        NANAO TO OZAKA OVERLAND\r\n\r\n\r\nNEXT morning Sano and Abé presented themselves with the welcome news\r\nthat everything was ready for our journey, and made many apologies for\r\nthe inconveniences we should have to put up with. They had provided a\r\nhandsome palanquin for each of us, and ordinary ones for Noguchi and\r\nMitford's Chinese servant, the philosophic Lin-fu. A guard was furnished\r\nof twenty two-sworded men carrying long staves, under the command of an\r\nofficer named Tominaga. We got away at half-past eight. Looking out to\r\nsea, we perceived that the \"Basilisk\" had departed, and that the\r\n\"Serpent\" was lying peacefully at anchor. The foreign department\r\nofficials did not show up, and it was to be concluded that they had made\r\nup their minds to submit. So we were perfectly free, away from our\r\nchief, from Tycoon's officials, from any other Europeans, embarked on an\r\nadventure in a totally unknown part of the country, which might end\r\nanyhow for aught we cared, but at any rate was of an altogether novel\r\ncharacter.\r\n\r\nAs soon as we were clear of the town we got out and walked. It was a\r\npiping hot day. Each man of the twenty who formed the escort as he went\r\nalong fanned himself with one hand, and wiped the perspiration from his\r\nbrow with a towel carried in the other. It soon became evident that we\r\nwere to be treated with great distinction, for we had not travelled more\r\nthan an hour and a half before we were invited to rest and refresh\r\nourselves with delicious water melons and tea; nectarines were also\r\noffered, but of such fearful unripeness that we dared not make their\r\nclose acquaintance. An hour further we had again to rest. Every one was\r\nexcessively polite; the peasants whom we met were made to crouch down\r\nand take off their hats. This was much more than could have been\r\nexpected after the scolding Sir Harry had given to Sano and his\r\ncolleagues on the previous day. The road lay up a gradually narrowing\r\nvalley, cultivated principally with rape and hemp. At a quarter past one\r\nwe stopped for lunch at a clean inn where they gave us a capital meal.\r\nAfter a nap we resumed our way at three o'clock down another valley,\r\nstopped to rest at half-past four, and reached our night quarters at\r\nhalf-past six, having accomplished eighteen miles. This was the village\r\nof Shiwo, prettily situated on the banks of a tiny stream, and close to\r\nthe mouth of a valley, the view up which into the hills growing ever\r\nhigher and higher was one of the charming prospects in which Japan\r\nabounds. After the hot bath, they served an excellent dinner with many\r\npolite apologies for its badness.\r\n\r\nThe next day brought us some sixteen miles further to Tsubata, where we\r\njoined the high road which traverses the dominions of the _daimiô_ from\r\none end to the other at no great distance from the coast. Here our\r\nescort left us, and a new set of men took their place. We were now\r\npassing through a more populous part of the country, and were objects of\r\nintense curiosity to the inhabitants. At Morimoto the front rooms of the\r\nhouses on both sides of the street were filled with spectators sitting\r\nin rows three or four deep or on mats placed at the side of the roadway.\r\n\r\nShortly after leaving this place we caught a glimpse of the white castle\r\nwalls of Kanazawa peeping through the pine trees. As soon as we came in\r\nsight of the town itself we got into our palanquins, and were carried to\r\none of the first houses, where we met Satomi and another official named\r\nTsunékawa. Crowds of spectators had assembled, and some of them were so\r\neager to gratify their curiosity that they even stood in a muddy lotus\r\npond which commanded a view of the back of the house where we were. Here\r\ndelicious melons and apples were served with frozen snow from the\r\nmountains behind the town. Gold paper screens lined the walls, there\r\nwere tables piled high with fruit and cakes, and in the recess behind\r\nthe seat of honour a beautiful writing box of the finest gold lacquer,\r\nin case we wished to sit down and write letters. A most unnecessary\r\npiece of ceremonial preparation, one would say.\r\n\r\nThe officials asked us to proceed from here on foot in order that the\r\npeople might see us better, but we preferred making use of our\r\npalanquins, as we had on our travelling garments, and were somewhat\r\ndusty and way-worn. The streets were thickly lined with spectators of\r\nall ranks and ages, among whom were some very pretty girls. Another\r\ncharming resting place had been prepared for us, into which they obliged\r\nus to turn aside, although we had previously expressed our wish to go on\r\nstraight to the inn. Continuing thence along the street, thickly filled\r\nwith inquisitive but perfectly orderly townspeople, we crossed a bridge,\r\nand after turning a few times to right and left, at last reached our\r\ninn, rather tired with all the fuss and ceremony.\r\n\r\nAt the porch we were welcomed by Satomi, who had hurried on ahead to\r\nsuperintend our reception. He conducted us through several rooms into an\r\ninner room of great size, spread with a huge velvet-pile carpet and\r\nfurnished with Chinese tables and scarlet-lacquered chairs such as the\r\nhigh priests of Buddhist temples occupy on grand ceremonial occasions.\r\nThe host immediately presented himself, bowing his head to the floor as\r\nif he were saluting a pair of kings. Each servant who brought in the\r\ntobacco trays or tea bowed low to the ground, then advanced holding the\r\narticle high in both hands, deposited it on the table, and then retiring\r\nbackwards to the edge of the carpet, knocked his head on the floor again\r\nbefore withdrawing. We were conducted in turn to the bath with great\r\nceremony, and then put on our best clothes (which were neither new nor\r\ngood) to receive visitors. The first to call was a special messenger\r\nfrom the _daimiô_, to express a hope that we had not suffered from the\r\nheat, and rejoicing at our fortunate arrival. Mitford replied with great\r\ndignity that we had not felt the heat. We were deeply grateful for the\r\nhospitality and kindness shown to us, and would like to call on the\r\n_daimiô_ to thank him in person. \"My master,\" said the messenger, \"is\r\nunfortunately indisposed, otherwise he would have been delighted to make\r\nyour acquaintance.\" Mitford expressed a hope that he would soon recover.\r\nThe real truth I imagine to have been that an interview between a\r\n_daimiô_ and two foreigners would have involved far too important and\r\ncomplicated decisions on questions of etiquette for it to be lightly\r\ncontemplated. The messenger added that he had been commanded by his\r\nmaster to offer us a small entertainment, and to accompany us in\r\npartaking of it. Mitford rose to even greater heights of flowery speech\r\nthan before, and invented a message from Sir Harry Parkes (which if the\r\nchief did not actually charge us with, the omission could only be\r\nattributed to inadvertence), expressing his desire to swear eternal\r\nfriendship with the _daimiô_ and people of Kaga, which gave very great\r\nsatisfaction to the messenger and everyone else present. Doctors were\r\nalso introduced, whom the prince had deputed to attend on us in case we\r\nfelt any ill-effects from the heat.\r\n\r\nTo this exchange of compliments succeeded a feast resembling in\r\ncharacter what has already been described but far surpassing it in\r\nmagnificence and the number of courses. Observing that our Japanese\r\nentertainers were not comfortable on their chairs, we proposed to banish\r\nthe furniture and squat on the floor after the manner of the country,\r\nand thus facilitate the passing of the _saké_ cup. After a considerable\r\ntime had been passed in general conversation, and everyone's head was\r\nmore or less heated, we introduced political topics, which were\r\ndiscussed very confidentially in the presence of a crowd of people.\r\n\r\nThe structure of a Japanese house is such that no secrets can be\r\nwhispered; there is always some one listening behind a paper partition\r\nor on the other side of a screen, and if you wish to hatch a plot, your\r\nbest way is to transfer your deliberations to the middle of the garden,\r\nwhere you can keep off eavesdroppers. However, as we could not do that\r\non the present occasion, it seemed better to take all who chose it into\r\nour confidence. The gist of the conversation amounted to this--that the\r\nKaga people wished to trade with foreigners, but did not wish avowedly\r\nto make an open port of Nanao, because the Tycoon's government would\r\nthen try to deprive them of it; but they would agree to its being an\r\nanchorage for foreign vessels, ancillary to Niigata, and to goods being\r\nlanded there, in which case everything else would naturally follow. If\r\nthe Tycoon's government were to inquire what view they took of the\r\nquestion, they would reply ambiguously. Our answer was that of course we\r\ndesired to act in harmony with the wishes of the _daimiô_, and would do\r\nnothing that could possibly be prejudicial to his interests. This proved\r\nvery satisfactory to our entertainers, who declared the warm feelings of\r\nfriendship for us which animated them, and a stratagem, the details of\r\nwhich I do not recollect, was agreed upon for keeping up secret and\r\nconfidential communications with them after our return to Yedo. Both\r\nsides bound themselves to secrecy, and the party broke up.\r\n\r\nThe bedding, which was of the most magnificent description, was then\r\nbrought in, piles of soft, quilted mattresses covered with silk or\r\ncrape, and stuffed with silk wool, and a large net of silk gauze was\r\nhung up to keep off the mosquitoes. Then a freshly-infused pot of green\r\ntea, with teacups, on a small tray, and the necessary apparatus for\r\nsmoking, were gently slid under the bottom of the mosquito curtain, and\r\nthe people of the house wished us a good night's rest. In the morning\r\nthe very first thing, before we were awake, the same elements of a\r\ncomfortable existence were provided in the same unobtrusive manner.\r\n\r\nThe forenoon was spent in choosing lacquer and porcelain. On the\r\nprevious evening an arrangement had been made for our visiting the\r\nneighbouring hills, but some hitch had occurred, and we were now asked\r\nto accept instead an excursion to Kanaiwa, the port of Kanazawa. It lay\r\nat a distance of about five miles, so we started on horseback about\r\nthree o'clock. Our steeds were rather shabby-looking ponies, unshod,\r\nwith saddles in the European fashion covered with thick black paper\r\ninstead of leather, and painfully stiff bridles of badly tanned leather.\r\nNoguchi was mounted on a pony splendidly caparisoned in the native\r\nstyle, and the philosophic Lin-fu, who could not ride, was put into a\r\npalanquin. Though we had such a very short way to ride, it was supposed\r\nthat delicately nurtured persons like ourselves would feel the fatigue,\r\nand three resting places had been prepared, two on the road and one at\r\nKanaiwa itself. The so-called port proved to be an open roadstead at the\r\nmouth of an insignificant stream, quite useless except in perfectly calm\r\nweather.\r\n\r\nAt dinner that evening we had some further talk with a couple of\r\nofficials. They had come to the conclusion, after thinking over the\r\nconversation of the previous evening, that it would be their wisest\r\ncourse to admit to the Tycoon's government the probability of a certain\r\namount of trade taking place at Nanao. In that way no danger would arise\r\nof their getting into trouble for what would otherwise be smuggling. We\r\napproved of this proposal, and suggested their sending to Yedo some one\r\nauthorized to treat with the government and the foreign representatives.\r\nIn the course of conversation on the domestic politics of the country,\r\nthey said that in their opinion the Tycoon's government ought to be\r\nsupported, and not done away with altogether, as the Satsuma and Chôshiû\r\npeople, with other clans, were believed to be advocating. But at the\r\nsame time limits ought to be placed on its authority. They had read my\r\npamphlet, and entirely approved of the suggestions it contained. After\r\nthat, all one could say was that we entirely concurred in the views of\r\nthe Kaga clan. As a matter of fact, these people were rather too remote\r\nfrom the main centre of political thought to be cognisant of or\r\nsympathise with the aspirations of the southern and western clans. They\r\nlay in an isolated position on the northern coast, in a part of the\r\ncountry that had always been looked upon somewhat as the home of\r\nignorance and want of culture. They cared only for themselves. The lands\r\nheld by the _daimiô_ of Kaga were assessed at a much greater annual\r\nvalue than the fief of any other prince, which gave the clansmen an\r\nimportance in the eyes of the rest of the world with which they were\r\nthoroughly satisfied; an alteration in the political organization of the\r\ncountry could hardly benefit them, and they were at bottom disposed to\r\nbe contented with the _status quo_.\r\n\r\nThe British Legation, on the contrary, were determined that so far as\r\ntheir influence went, the Mikado should be restored to the headship of\r\nthe nation, so that our treaties might receive a sanction that no one\r\nwould venture to dispute, and for this purpose it was necessary that the\r\nconstitution of the Tycoon's government should be modified in such a\r\nmanner as to admit the principal _daimiôs_ (or clans rather) to a share\r\nin the distribution of power.\r\n\r\nOur hosts would have been contented to keep us longer, but we were due\r\nat Ozaka at a fixed date, and could not stay with them. We resumed our\r\njourney, therefore, on the morning of August 14. The landlord was very\r\nurgent with us that we should call in passing at a shop for patent\r\nmedicines kept by a relation, to lay in a stock of a preparation called\r\n\"purple snow\" (_shi-setsu_), composed chiefly of nitre and perfumed with\r\nmusk, and believed to be a remedy for most of the ills to which flesh is\r\nheir. The streets were again crowded with eager spectators. When just\r\nclear of the town we were forced to alight from our _kagos_ for a\r\nparting feast at a restaurant on a height commanding a picturesque view\r\nof the castle, which planted plentifully with trees presented a\r\npark-like aspect very unlike the grim fortresses which in Europe usually\r\ngo by the name. Here we spent an hour eating fish and drinking _saké_,\r\nand vowing eternal friendship with the Kaga clansmen, with whom previous\r\nto this visit we had had no intercourse whatever.\r\n\r\nWe lunched that day at Mattô, where I had a long talk with the mayor\r\nupon things in general, in the presence of a vast and attentive crowd,\r\nand reached Komatsu in the evening, having accomplished twenty miles.\r\nThis was very fair going, considering the numerous delays and stoppages\r\nfor refreshment. The next day we passed the boundary line between the\r\nterritories of Kanazawa and Daishôji, where the escort was changed. At\r\nthe latter town we found the streets entirely cleared, and crowds of\r\npeople quietly sitting in the front rooms of the houses, among them many\r\ndaughters of the best families in holiday garb, with wreaths of silver\r\nflowers on their heads, their faces nicely powdered with white lead, and\r\ntheir lips stained with the safflower dye which imparts such a curious\r\nmetallic lustre to the skin. Here we took a formal farewell of Okada and\r\nShimbô, two Kaga gentlemen who had accompanied us during the previous\r\ndays. Mitford's Chinese servant came in for a share in the general\r\nleave-taking, and philosophically remarked that he did not understand\r\nJapanese etiquette, which appears to consist chiefly in the performance\r\nof the _ko-t'ou_.\r\n\r\nAbout three miles further we finally quitted the domains of the Maeda\r\nfamily, and passed into the territory of Echizen. There was no guard to\r\nmeet us, only a couple of policemen, and it was proposed that we should\r\nretrace our steps to a tea-house half a mile back, to wait till an\r\nescort could be procured. To this we objected, saying that we were\r\nwilling to go on without a guard. The _rusui_ or head bailiff of the\r\n_daimiô_ of Daishôji said that it would not be correct for his men to\r\nundertake our protection beyond the limits. Finally a compromise was\r\neffected. Okada and Shimbô, who in spite of the formal parting that had\r\ntaken place at Daishôji, were still of the party, borrowed ten men from\r\nthe bailiff on the distinct understanding that they were not any longer\r\na guard, and walked on with us. Shortly afterwards we met an Echizen\r\nofficial of low rank (he was a _metsuké_ or assistant clerk), and our\r\nKaga friends took their final leave of us, not without expressing the\r\nopinion that the Echizen people showed very little courtesy in not\r\ndeputing some one of more exalted rank to offer us a welcome. But the\r\nfact was we were not welcome at all, as we speedily found, for although\r\nevery possible pains had been taken to provide us with good food and\r\nquarters, the whole Echizen clan held aloof from us. For instance at\r\nKanadzu, where we passed the night, the whole town was illuminated with\r\ncoloured lanterns, and the spectators who crowded the main street went\r\ndown on their knees in the usual respectful manner.\r\n\r\nVery beautiful guest rooms had been prepared for us at a monastery,\r\nchairs and tables had been provided, and a couple of good little boys,\r\nof preternaturally solemn demeanour, sat on the floor behind us to fan\r\naway the mosquitoes. The superior civilization and resources of the\r\ncountry, as compared with Kaga, were exhibited by the production of beer\r\nand champagne. Next day we reached Fukui, the capital of the province, a\r\ntown of about 40,000 inhabitants. Here again the streets had been\r\ncleared; spectators in their best were seated in rows in the shops, and\r\nlooked just as if they had paid for their places, like the people who go\r\nto see the Queen open Parliament. I never saw so many pretty girls\r\ntogether anywhere. White brooms and buckets of water stood before each\r\nhouse, as a sign that the road had been swept clean and the dust laid.\r\nWe were conducted to the monastery of the Hongwanji sect, a new and\r\nhandsome building, where a large room had been prepared for us, and hung\r\nwith silk crape curtains dyed with the Echizen crest. In the recess\r\nstood a beautiful vase containing a huge bouquet of lotus flowers,\r\nstanding quite six feet high. The table was loaded with piles of fruit\r\nand cakes, and the usual Japanese luncheon was served, with champagne.\r\nNo one approached us, with the exception of a young Japanese who had\r\nbeen in the service of a foreigner at Nagasaki and spoke a little\r\nEnglish; but numbers of officials, some of high rank, collected in the\r\npassages to stare at us. We took no notice of them, adopting the\r\nperfectly cold and impassive manner of Orientals on their dignity. This\r\nwas bad, but worse came behind.\r\n\r\nAlthough on our quitting Fukui, they sent men before us to sweep the\r\nroad ahead, our guards were rude, and chaffed about us among themselves.\r\nAt Fuchiû, the town where we stopped for the night, a noisy crowd\r\npursued us from the entrance of the town to our lodging, running along\r\nthe other side of the stream which lay along the middle of the street.\r\nArrived at the inn, we found the dais room shut up, and the matted\r\nfloors spread with _shibukami_, a sort of thick, tough paper in sheets,\r\nwhich is laid down when any particularly dirty household business is to\r\ntake place. It is the correlative of the dust sheets used in England to\r\ncover up furniture when a weekly cleaning takes place. We were, of\r\ncourse, indignant, but I think these, to us, offensive precautions had\r\nbeen taken in the belief that we were ignorant of Japanese manners and\r\ncustoms, and would walk in with our shoes on.\r\n\r\nThe day after this we crossed the boundary on the top of a hill called\r\nthe Tochinoki Tôgé (Horse-Chestnut Pass), where we said good-bye to the\r\nrude Echizen escort, and were taken charge of by men belonging to Ii\r\nKamon no Kami, the _daimiô_ of Hikoné. A very moderate bill was\r\npresented to us for our board, lodging and coolie hire, which we paid,\r\nand we offered payment also for the extras in the shape of beer,\r\nchampagne and fish, but could not induce the officials to accept it.\r\n\r\nIt is not very easy to explain why the Echizen people showed such an\r\nutter want of cordiality, but I think it may perhaps be attributable to\r\nthe difficult position in which the clan then stood. Its head was\r\nclosely allied to the Tycoon's family, being in fact descended from one\r\nof the sons of Iyéyasu, the founder of the Tycoonate. Although perfectly\r\nwell aware of the difficulties in which the Tycoon was involved, he was\r\nnot prepared to side with the Satsuma and Chôshiû party, which aimed at\r\nthe restoration of the Mikado, and was probably acquainted with the\r\npolicy of the British Legation, as supposed to be set forth in my\r\npamphlet. Intimacy with foreigners had never until quite lately been a\r\npart of the government programme, and the Echizen people very likely\r\nthought it wiser to hold entirely aloof from us, in spite of the recent\r\nchange of attitude on the part of the Tycoon, especially as the\r\nsouth-western _daimiôs_ had never openly adhered to the policy of\r\nfriendship with foreigners. The \"expulsion of the barbarians\" was still\r\ntheir ostensible party cry. So that on the whole I incline to the\r\nopinion that extreme caution was the keynote to the want of cordiality\r\ndisplayed by the Echizen folk.\r\n\r\nWe stopped that night at a little village among the hills called\r\nNaka-no-kawachi, where we could get nothing to eat but rice and tea. In\r\nordinary years there are no mosquitoes here, owing to its elevation, and\r\nwe had therefore considerable trouble in procuring mosquito curtains.\r\nThe general aspect of the country reminded me closely of Scawfell Pass\r\nin Cumberland. At the further foot of the hills we passed one of those\r\nbarriers, curious relics of a past full of suspicion, where no woman was\r\nallowed to pass, and where every man had to exhibit a passport. At\r\nNagahama we met an official of the Tycoon's government named Tsukahara\r\nKwanjirô (brother of Tsukahara Tajima no Kami), with eighteen of the\r\nforeign guard, who henceforward charged themselves with our protection.\r\nSir Harry Parkes had passed through here in May last in returning from\r\nhis visit to Tsuruga, and we found the people disposed to be familiar\r\nand careless of our comfort. We felt that we were now little better than\r\nprisoners; farewell all jollity and all politeness on the part of the\r\ninhabitants. We hastened on as rapidly as possible, being now as anxious\r\nto get over the rest of our journey as we had in the beginning been\r\ndisposed to loiter among a friendly population.\r\n\r\nAt Takamiya, where we lunched, we found the dais room closed against us,\r\nbut I took the innkeeper and his servants roundly to task, and made them\r\nopen it. After this, they recognized that we understood Japanese\r\netiquette, and for their previous rudeness substituted perfect courtesy.\r\nAs we were now about to quit the territory of Ii Kamon no Kami, we\r\noffered to settle our bill for lodging and coolie hire, but the official\r\nin charge refused to accept payment, alleging that he had received\r\nreiterated orders not to take anything from us. So we contented\r\nourselves with addressing to him a letter of acknowledgment, and told\r\nhim we would thank the _daimiô's_ people on our return to Yedo. The\r\nlocal escort left us at Nakajiku, the boundary, and we were consigned to\r\nthe care of the foreign guard, who concerned themselves very little on\r\nour behalf. The consequence of this was that the people crowded in upon\r\nus at every village, and were extremely rude in their behaviour. On our\r\narrival at Musa I administered a quiet blowing-up to the commander of\r\nthe guard, who promised that things should be better arranged for the\r\nmorrow.\r\n\r\nNext day we reached Kusatsu, where, to our surprise, we fell in with a\r\ncouple more Tycoon's officials, whom I knew very well, Takabataké Gorô\r\nand a young fellow named Koméda Keijirô, the latter of whom spoke\r\nEnglish remarkably well. They told us that they had come overland from\r\nYedo with Hirayama Dzusho no Kami, one of the Tycoon's second council,\r\nand had been dropped here by him to look after us. He had charged them\r\nto say to us that the temple of Ishiyama, just below the Seta Bridge,\r\nwhich had been closed to Sir Harry in May, would be shown to us, and was\r\nwell worthy of a visit. This temple in fact lay on the route which\r\nTsukahara had already persuaded us to adopt. We were to take boat at\r\nKusatsu, descend the river which flows out of the Biwa Lake as far as\r\nthe rapids, then walk for about a couple of leagues (five miles), and\r\ntake boat again to Fushimi. This, he said, was a much shorter and\r\npleasanter route than that which Wirgman and I had taken in May. We\r\ntherefore jumped at the offer made on the part of Hirayama, whom we\r\nvoted a capital fellow, and some amicable conversation followed on\r\nJapanese politics, in which they tried to persuade us that the positions\r\ntaken up by my pamphlet were all wrong, but without success.\r\n\r\nAfter they left, Noguchi came to me and said that the road over the\r\nhills to Uji, instead of being only ten or twelve miles, as had been\r\nrepresented to us, was in reality much nearer five-and-twenty, so that\r\nwe could not possibly get there by mid-day. A misgiving immediately\r\narose in my mind that there was something concealed behind all this\r\nsolicitude about our seeing temples. Probably the Tycoon's officials\r\nwanted to get us away from Otsu, which lay on the direct route, and the\r\nvicinity of Kiôto, in order to prevent trouble with the anti-Tycoon\r\nparty, such as had occurred in May when Sir Harry passed through there.\r\nI therefore despatched Noguchi to probe Tsukahara, and sent for the\r\nposting officer to inquire about the distances. What he told me only\r\nconfirmed my suspicions, which I then mentioned to Mitford. We therefore\r\nresolved to go by Otsu and to run all risks. We had invited Takabataké\r\nand the other man to dinner. Just before our guests arrived Noguchi\r\nreturned, and I imparted my suspicions to him. He thought I was wrong.\r\nAs soon as they came in, I announced to Takabataké our intention of\r\ntaking the usual route. He was greatly disconcerted, declared it would\r\nbe very inconvenient, nay impossible. I replied that we were indifferent\r\nto temples and scenery, but extremely fond of saving time in travelling;\r\nand as the road by Otsu was the shorter, we would take it. Seeing that\r\nwe were very firm in our resolve, he retired from the room, and got hold\r\nof Noguchi, whom he begged to use his influence. Noguchi thereupon\r\ncalled me outside for a private conversation, and urged me to adhere to\r\nthe original arrangement. I replied that it was useless; we wanted to go\r\nby the shorter route, and if altering the arrangements as to boats,\r\netc., cost money, we were willing to pay it. I returned to the\r\ndining-room, and my answer was communicated to Takabataké, who thereupon\r\ncalled out Koméda. Koméda came back, and begged me in turn to come out;\r\nas soon as we were alone, he said that he wished to have a friendly\r\ntalk, and confessed that the whole thing was a plant. I said that we\r\nknew it before, and had felt convinced that Tsukahara had been sent down\r\nfrom Kiôto by the Tycoon's prime minister (Itakura Iga no Kami) to\r\nhoodwink us. If they had told us the truth in the beginning, we would\r\nhave complied with their wishes; but that now it was too late to talk to\r\nus of going so far out of our way merely to oblige them. We then\r\nreturned to the dining-room again, and tried to proceed with our meal.\r\n\r\nThe three Japanese were very crestfallen, and became still more so when\r\nMitford suddenly turned to Koméda and said to him in English that if the\r\nprivate secretary (_ometsuké_) who had been sent down from Kiôto on this\r\nparticular business would address to him a letter stating explicitly the\r\nreasons why they wished us to change our route, we would fall in with\r\ntheir wishes; otherwise we would go by Otsu, even if the guard should\r\nrefuse to accompany us. After a little demur, they accepted his offer,\r\nas the easiest alternative, and Takabataké went off to prepare the\r\nletter. We had great difficulty in obtaining a document to our minds.\r\nTakabataké produced three drafts, one after the other, which had to be\r\nrejected, because it was alleged in them that we were travelling without\r\nthe permission of the government, and the phraseology was so confused\r\nthat it became impossible to make head or tail of it. At three o'clock\r\nin the morning they at last brought the fair copy of what we had\r\ninsisted on being put down in black and white, namely that great\r\ncomplications had arisen at Kiôto in the previous May on account of Sir\r\nHarry's passing through Otsu, which was only six miles from the Mikado's\r\ncapital, and begging Mitford as a favour to go by way of Uji. Great\r\nvictory for us and corresponding defeat for the Japanese officials.\r\n\r\nI had very little sleep that night, for we were on the move by a quarter\r\nto seven. We went in palanquins as far as the bridge of Séta, and\r\nembarking in a boat, proceeded down the river to Ishiyama-dera. As soon\r\nas we were sighted by the priests in charge, they ran to shut the gates\r\nin our face. So much for Hirayama's promise of admission. It was a very\r\nhot day. We left the river to ascend and descend a series of little\r\nhills for four miles, and then came out by the river again. Here we got\r\na scanty meal of rice and tea, all that was procurable in such an\r\nout-of-the-way spot. Then along the path for a mile or so by the river,\r\nwhich roared over its rocky bed between steep schistose hills, and then\r\nclimbed a very stiff ascent, trying in the extreme under the burning\r\nAugust sun. At every peasant's hut they told us that it was still four\r\nmiles to Uji. Frequently we had to stop and wash out our mouths by some\r\nscanty stream trickling from the rock. But at last we reached the\r\nsummit, and gained a magnificent view of the great plain below, in the\r\ncentre of which lies the mysterious and jealously guarded Kiôto, like a\r\nJapanese Mecca, in which it was death for the heathen foreigner to set\r\nhis foot. To the left lay Fushimi, with its network of canals and\r\nrivers, far away in front the sacred top of Atagoyama. At four o'clock\r\nwe got to Uji, hot and tired, having trudged our weary way almost\r\nunceasingly since noon. We rested for a couple of hours at a charming\r\ntea-house on the bank of the river close to the broken bridge. At six we\r\nembarked in a comfortable houseboat, and drifted rapidly down stream to\r\nFushimi, where we got a bath and dinner at the official hotel. Noguchi\r\nafterwards told me that he had overheard some men there talking about\r\nthe advisability of murdering us. However, they lacked the courage to\r\ncarry out their idea, and we got away safely at nine in a large boat. It\r\nwas too hot to sleep inside, so I lay all night on the gangway which ran\r\nalong the gunwale, overhanging the water.\r\n\r\nEarly in the morning we reached Ozaka, washed our faces in the stream,\r\ndressed, and betook ourselves to the temple we had occupied in the\r\nspring. Sir Harry turned up in the afternoon, with the news of the\r\nmurder of two sailors of H.M.S. \"Icarus\" at Nagasaki, as they were lying\r\nin a drunken sleep on the roadway in a low quarter of the town. Before\r\nthis new outrage the tale of our experiences paled altogether in\r\ninterest.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XXI\r\n\r\n                          OZAKA AND TOKUSHIMA\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE next few days were occupied almost exclusively with the question of\r\nwhat measures were to be adopted for the detection and punishment of the\r\nmurderers of the \"Icarus\" sailors at Nagasaki. Sir Harry, as was very\r\nnatural, took up the matter with great warmth, and used some extremely\r\nstrong language to the principal minister of the Tycoon, a good-natured,\r\nyet not by any means weak, old gentleman named Itakura Iga no Kami. He\r\nseemed to be old, though probably not over five-and-forty. The rumour at\r\nNagasaki had been that the perpetrators were Tosa men, and the suspicion\r\nwas strengthened by the fact that a sailing vessel and a steamer\r\nbelonging to Tosa, which were lying in the harbour, suddenly left before\r\ndawn, a few hours after the murder. It was suggested that the\r\nperpetrators had escaped in the sailing vessel, as she left an hour and\r\na half before the steamer, and that they were transferred to the latter\r\nsomewhere outside the harbour. As far as we could judge, the Tycoon's\r\ngovernment seemed to entertain the same suspicions. The Tosa men had\r\nalways had the reputation for being more savagely disposed than any\r\nother Japanese. The government promised to dismiss the two governors of\r\nNagasaki, and to send a body of 500 men from Yedo to patrol the foreign\r\nsettlement at Nagasaki to prevent anything of the kind recurring. Upon\r\nthis Sir Harry accepted an invitation to see the Tycoon, who had come\r\ndown from Kiôto to give an audience to the French Minister, M. Roches,\r\nabout the recent arrest of some native Christians at Nagasaki. Sir\r\nHarry, Mitford and I went accordingly to the castle in palanquins, as\r\nthe weather was very hot, and no good ponies could be procured. We were\r\nreceived in the private drawing-room (_shiro-in_). The Tycoon, who\r\nlooked a little worn, had with him Itakura and Hirayama; the latter was\r\na little old man of rather low origin with sharp cunning features, who\r\nhad lately been promoted. We nicknamed him the fox, and he deserved it\r\nwell.\r\n\r\nAfter an hour's talk, on indifferent matters, we were joined by Admiral\r\nKeppel and his staff. This led to some conversation on naval affairs,\r\nbut I came to the conclusion that His Highness took very little interest\r\nin the subject. After a while the Tycoon sent for Matsudaira Kansô, the\r\nex-_daimiô_ of Hizen, an oldish-looking man of forty-seven, and\r\nintroduced him to Sir Harry and the Admiral. He had a sharp countenance,\r\nand spoke in a fitful, abrupt manner, constantly winking with both eyes.\r\nHe had the reputation of being a time-server and a great intriguer, and\r\ncertainly, up to the very moment of the revolution, which took place in\r\n1868, he never allowed anyone to guess what side he would take. He sat\r\nnext to the Tycoon on his left, and the only other mark of respect,\r\nother than that due to equals, which he employed in speaking was the\r\nword \"kami,\" for \"you.\" Sir Harry endeavoured to get an invitation out\r\nof him to visit his place at Saga, but he was too wary, and merely\r\nexpressed the expectation that they might meet some day at Nagasaki; but\r\nthat never came to pass. When the Tycoon was tired of talking we\r\nadjourned to the next room, where a Japanese luncheon was served, with\r\ncold _saké_; which was a sign that no one was expected to take more than\r\nenough.\r\n\r\nEarly that morning I had received a call from Saigô Kichinosuké, and\r\nhere I insert a translation of a letter which he afterwards wrote to\r\nOkubo Ichizô giving an account of our conversation. The original was\r\nfound many years afterwards among the papers of Iwakura Jijiû, and a\r\ncopy was given to me in 1906, as I was passing through Tôkiô on my way\r\nhome from Peking, by my old friend Matsugata Masayoshi.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Copy of letter addressed by Saigô Takamori to Okubo Toshimichi.\r\n\r\n    Yesterday morning at 6 I arrived at Ozaka, and on inquiring\r\n    where was the lodging of the English, I learnt that it was at\r\n    the temple where they were in the spring; so I at once sent to\r\n    Satow to inquire at what time to-day it would be convenient for\r\n    me to call. The answer was that I should come at 7 o'clock. I\r\n    went at that hour, and found he had just woke, and I was shown\r\n    upstairs. I said that hearing of the minister's arrival at\r\n    Ozaka, I had been, as you know, sent as a special messenger to\r\n    inquire after his health. The ordinary compliments having been\r\n    offered, he said the mail to England was being despatched about\r\n    ten o'clock, and that at half-past eleven the minister was going\r\n    to the Castle. I said that I had no particular business, but had\r\n    only come to call in order to congratulate him on his arrival at\r\n    Ozaka. As he must be very busy, I would not trouble him with a\r\n    personal interview, and begged him to say so to the Minister. He\r\n    replied that the Minister particularly wished to meet me, but as\r\n    he was so much occupied he would ask to be excused that day. He\r\n    said the Minister would remain two or three days at Ozaka, and\r\n    particularly desired to meet me, and he thought he would be able\r\n    to give me an interview in two or three days. He said he would\r\n    sail from here on the 2nd of next month in order to return to\r\n    Yokohama (or probably Yedo).\r\n\r\n    When I saw Satow, he said things were exactly as before and that\r\n    there had been no change of any importance, and the position\r\n    being just as before, it was entirely different from what\r\n    Shibayama had suspected; therefore I told him that the Ozaka\r\n    Commercial Co. has, as I said to you the other day, agreed with\r\n    the French, and is planning to make great profits. [An obscure\r\n    passage follows.]\r\n\r\n    I said I should like to try to discuss the settlement of\r\n    Japanese affairs by the French, on which Satow replied that he\r\n    would very much like to argue it. I told him the French said\r\n    Japan must have a single concentrated government like all\r\n    western countries, and the _daimiôs_ must be deprived of their\r\n    power. Above all it was desirable to destroy the two provinces\r\n    of Chôshiû and Satsuma, and that it would be well to join in\r\n    subduing them. I asked what he thought of this. Satow then\r\n    answered that it might be seen from the two previous attempts at\r\n    subjugation, that a government which had not been able to beat\r\n    Chôshiû alone would certainly not be able to deprive all the\r\n    _daimiôs_ of their powers. I said: How could such weak people be\r\n    helped. He replied that not a word could be said to that, and\r\n    the argument was impossible. If such an argument were publicly\r\n    brought forward, there was no doubt that they would help the\r\n    government to destroy the _daimiôs_. It was heard that the idea\r\n    was that in two or three years' time money would be collected,\r\n    machinery be provided, French assistance be invoked and war be\r\n    begun. As the French would then send troops to give assistance,\r\n    it would be dangerous unless an opposite great Power were got to\r\n    assist. If a report were then spread that England would also\r\n    send out troops to protect, it would be impossible for French\r\n    auxiliary troops to be set in motion; he said that therefore it\r\n    was necessary to come to a thorough agreement beforehand. In the\r\n    first place the English idea was that the sovereign of Japan\r\n    should wield the governing power, and under him the _daimiôs_\r\n    should be placed, and so the establishment of the constitution\r\n    (or national polity) would be similar to the system of all other\r\n    countries. This was the first (word omitted here) thing of all.\r\n    The sovereign of England had lately sent to the _Bakufu_ a\r\n    letter addressed to the sovereign of Japan. This was a letter of\r\n    condolence on hearing of the death of the late Emperor. This was\r\n    to be delivered to the Emperor by the _Bakufu_. It would be\r\n    improper if no reply were made to it, but up to the present no\r\n    reply had been received.\r\n\r\n    Although that was what they had declared with respect to the\r\n    Emperor of Japan, at Kiôto H.M. did not take that view at all.\r\n    It was maintained that the admission of aliens into the capital\r\n    would be a defilement. As that sort of thing was undesirable, it\r\n    would be necessary that a definite form of government vis-a-vis\r\n    all countries carried on ordinary relations. If it was desired\r\n    to consult with England, he would like to be informed, and as he\r\n    was disposed to undertake the assistance asked for I replied\r\n    that we would exert ourselves for the transformation of the\r\n    Japanese government and we had no justification (?) vis-a-vis\r\n    foreigners.\r\n\r\n    The French grabbed profit at Yokohama and entered into\r\n    agreements for their own pleasure. England was a country based\r\n    on commerce, and would strenuously oppose any attempt to hinder\r\n    commerce, and was therefore extremely indignant.\r\n\r\n    The culprits who had killed two English sailors at Nagasaki were\r\n    not yet known. We had heard it was rumoured to be the act of\r\n    Nagasaki[3] men. He heard that Nagasaki was very badly spoken\r\n    of. When Satow and others travelled overland from Echizen,\r\n    Nagasaki men lay in wait for them at Fushimi. It was also said\r\n    by many that they committed acts of violence at Kiôto, and\r\n    gathered gamblers together. If it was Nagasaki men who had\r\n    killed aliens at Nagasaki, it was to be much regretted as doing\r\n    a great injury.\r\n\r\n        [3] Substituted by Saigô for Tosa.\r\n\r\n    When they came to Echizen no one came to meet them. Though local\r\n    governors came to meet them in the country, no one came to see\r\n    them at the castle-town, but they were entertained hospitably\r\n    with _saké_ and _sakana_. Satow said he could not understand\r\n    this.\r\n\r\n    The above is a summary of the important points. Satow says he\r\n    will come here to-morrow at ten o'clock, and I think there will\r\n    be more conversation. I propose to stay two or three days\r\n    longer, so please understand that. Satow's language about the\r\n    _Bakufu_ is very insulting. I will tell you all in detail.\r\n    Good-bye. 27th of 7th moon.\r\n\r\n                                              SAIGO KICHINOSUKE.\r\n    Okubo Ichizô sama.\r\n\r\n    P.S. note by penman.--This copy of the letter contains\r\n    obscurities, and some incorrect transcriptions.\r\n\r\nNext day I went to see Saigô at the Satsuma agency, in order to learn\r\nfrom him how things were going on at Kiôto. He talked a good deal of a\r\nparliament of the whole nation, to be established as a substitute for\r\nthe existing government of the Tycoon, which I found from my young\r\nfriend Matsuné was a very general idea among the anti-Tycoon party. To\r\nme it seemed a mad idea. Saigô also revealed to me a plan conceived by\r\nthe government for monopolizing all the trade of Ozaka and Hiôgo by\r\nplacing it in the hands of a guild of twenty rich native merchants,\r\nwhich was no doubt copied from the old arrangement at Canton before the\r\nopium war of 1840.\r\n\r\nThis piece of news, when it was brought to him, inflamed the chief's\r\nwrath, who immediately got hold of the prime minister and insisted upon\r\nthe scheme being abandoned. A new proclamation was issued, annulling the\r\nprevious one establishing the guild, but as it was extorted by dint of\r\ngreat diplomatic pressure, I had very little belief in its being acted\r\non. It was, and always has been, a Japanese idea to regulate commerce,\r\nboth domestic and foreign, by means of the guilds, who pay for their\r\nmonopoly, and make the most of it. Whatever may be the abstract merits\r\nof such a system, it is not altogether in accordance with western ideas,\r\nand we have never ceased to make war upon it whenever it crossed our\r\npath in eastern countries.\r\n\r\nAnother matter about which we had to speak very strongly was the wording\r\nof the Tycoon's reply to the Queen's letter, conveying the usual\r\nexpressions of condolence on the death of the late Mikado. The ministers\r\napologized very humbly for having made use of discourteous forms, and\r\npromised to take great care for the future. The style of official\r\ndocuments addressed to the British Minister was also a subject upon\r\nwhich we had never-ending disputes with the Japanese officials, and it\r\nwas only after the revolution that I succeeded in getting these things\r\ndone in proper form. Their object was always by the use of particular\r\nforms and turns of phraseology to convey to their own people the belief\r\nthat the foreign representatives were the inferiors of the Tycoon's\r\nministers; doubtless they did not in their own country hold a rank at\r\nall approaching that of the high functionaries they had to deal with,\r\nmost of whom were _daimiôs_, and it was a difficult matter, as it always\r\nhas been in every eastern country, to induce them to recognize the\r\nofficial position of a diplomatist representing his sovereign.\r\n\r\nI have said in an earlier chapter that one of my teachers at Yokohama\r\nhad been a retainer of the _daimiô_ of Awa. During the spring, when we\r\nwere first at Ozaka, there had been some talk about my going to pay the\r\n_daimiô_ a visit at his capital, which lay not far from that city, but\r\nowing to a misunderstanding it came to nothing. On the present occasion\r\nthe Awa people had sought me out again, and renewed the invitation,\r\nwhich I however persuaded them to transfer to Sir Harry and the Admiral.\r\nIt had been already agreed that the British Legation should proceed to\r\nthe province of Tosa in company with some special Commissioners of the\r\nTycoon, in order to discover, if possible, the murderers of the two\r\nsailors belonging to H.M.S. \"Icarus.\" Our wily old friend Hirayama was\r\nselected, along with a couple of other officials, for this business, and\r\nthey wished to precede us by a few days in order to make a preliminary\r\ninquiry. So when the projected visit to Awa came to the ears of the\r\nministers, they pressed Sir Harry to accept it, as Tokushima lay in the\r\ndirect route to Tosa, and also because they believed that the _daimiô_\r\nwas not a dangerous opponent, but rather inclined to be a partisan of\r\nthe Tycoon, if he took any side at all. Sir Harry was pleased, because\r\nhe liked these entertainments, and so the matter was settled to every\r\none's satisfaction. I took care to keep to myself the fact that the\r\ninvitation had really been intended for myself alone, the _daimiô_\r\nhaving heard about me from my teacher, and being curious to see the\r\nwriter of the pamphlet on \"English policy.\"\r\n\r\nSir Harry and Mitford went off in the \"Basilisk\" with Hewett, the\r\n\"Salamis\" remaining behind to pick me up on the following morning. She\r\nwas to leave at eleven, so I had to pack up overnight, and start very\r\nearly. I hurried off with the Legation writer Ono, leaving Noguchi in\r\ncharge of the baggage, and as usual he was late. I waited some time, but\r\nstill he delayed. I became impatient, and desperately started in a boat\r\nwith only the writer. Just as we were passing the proposed site of the\r\nforeign settlement, Noguchi came alongside in a tiny skiff, without the\r\nbaggage. Further down, near the mouth of the river, we changed into a\r\nlarger boat, built to cross the bar, and got on board half-an-hour late.\r\nTwo Awa officials had joined just before me, and to my great joy and\r\nrelief the baggage boat came alongside a quarter of an hour afterwards.\r\nWe weighed anchor precisely at noon, and steaming southward through the\r\nYura straits, got to the little harbour of Nei in Awa about six o'clock\r\nin the evening. The \"Basilisk\" was there already. Apparently no one\r\nawaited our arrival. Sir Harry therefore despatched me to Tokushima to\r\nfind out what sort of reception he might expect. I got into a big native\r\nsailing boat with one of the Awa officials, while the other man hastened\r\non ahead in another.\r\n\r\nThere was a fresh breeze, and we rushed along under the cliffs at a good\r\npace until we found ourselves approaching the bar at the mouth of the\r\nriver on which Tokushima is situated. It was already dark, and the\r\nbreakers extended right across the entrance. The other boat, which had\r\npreceded me, now turned back, and as she passed the people on board\r\nshouted out that the passage was no longer safe. My pilot however\r\ndisregarded the warning, and pushed boldly on. The passage was extremely\r\nnarrow, between widely extended sandbanks on either side; the huge waves\r\ntossed about the boat, big as it was, like a child's toy. At last after\r\nsome anxious minutes we got inside, and were now in comparatively smooth\r\nwater, without having shipped a drop. A great deal of apparently\r\nunmeaning shouting and hallooing took place, and our boat was allowed to\r\nsurge hither and thither, till we drifted back again to the sandbank,\r\nwhere we found the other Japanese; they had run their boat ashore in the\r\nmost reckless way, narrowly escaping a drowning in the surf.\r\n\r\nAfter mutual congratulations, we got into a houseboat and proceeded up\r\nthe river to the landing-place, where I had to wait some time till a\r\nguard of soldiers could be brought down. This gave time for a crowd of\r\nspectators to collect, in spite of the advanced hour. At last the guard\r\narrived; it consisted of cavalry, in long boots and conical hats, with\r\nwhite plumes of horsehair, commanded by a grizzled old warrior named\r\nHachisuka Mimasaka, a descendant of the robber chieftain who founded the\r\nHouse of Awa, but a retainer for all that. They escorted me in solemn\r\nprocession to a temple that had been prepared for our accommodation, by\r\nlaying down red felt carpets and furnishing it with hastily constructed\r\ntables, chairs and bedsteads. It was evident that they had expected only\r\na small party of three or four Europeans, but I explained to them that\r\nSir Harry would not land without the Admiral, and neither of them could\r\ncome on shore without the whole of his staff. So they had to make the\r\nbest of it, and greatly extend their preparations before I would\r\nacknowledge myself satisfied. They had written up our official titles\r\nover the doors of the rooms intended for us, and mine had been rendered\r\nby \"tongue-officer,\" a euphemism for interpreter; this I immediately had\r\ndone away with, and my name substituted, for in Japan the office of\r\ninterpreter at that time was looked upon as only fit for the lowest\r\nclass of domestic servants, and no one of _samurai_ rank would ever\r\ncondescend to speak a foreign language. I had often to fight pretty hard\r\nwith Japanese of rank in order to ensure being treated as something\r\nbetter than a valet or an orderly.\r\n\r\nMy good Awa friends, anxious to make me as happy as possible, had racked\r\ntheir brains in order to produce a dinner in European style, and a most\r\ndismal banquet it was; uneatable fishes in unsightly dishes, piles of\r\nunripe grapes and melons, heavy and tasteless sponge cakes, with coarse\r\nblack-handled knives and forks to eat with. A wretched being, who had\r\nbeen to the United States as a sailor and had picked up a few words of\r\nlow English, was put forward prominently to wait upon me, as if I were\r\nso ignorant of Japanese as to need an interpreter. It was explained that\r\nhe was the only person in the clan who understood European manners and\r\ncustoms. I found him disgustingly familiar, and had to address a private\r\nremonstrance to one of the officials who had come down with me, who said\r\nthat he was a privileged person \"on account of his great learning.\"\r\nNevertheless he administered a rebuke to the individual in question, who\r\nthereupon reverted to his native Japanese good manners.\r\n\r\nI had entirely lost my appetite, owing to having been without food since\r\nthe middle of the day. We proceeded to discuss various points of\r\netiquette connected with our proposed visit to the _daimiô_ at his\r\ncastle. It was the first occasion on which foreigners of rank had been\r\nreceived within the walls of a native baron's fortress. It was finally\r\ndecided that we should ride past the place where the notice to dismount\r\nstands, and get off our horses at the inner gate. The question of\r\nprecedence at table was also decided. On one side were to sit the\r\n_daimiô_, his eldest son and a _karô_ named Mori, Commander Suttie of\r\nthe \"Salamis,\" Major Crossman of the Royal Engineers, Lieutenant\r\nStephenson (flag lieutenant); on the other Sir Harry Parkes, Admiral Sir\r\nHarry Keppel, Captain Hewett, Mitford and Mr. Risk, the Admiral's\r\nsecretary; I was to sit at the head of the table between Sir Harry and\r\nthe _daimiô_. Separate and special individual presents were to be given\r\nto Sir Harry Parkes, to the Admiral and to myself, and a general present\r\nto all the others, to be divided among them as they liked. After all\r\nthese knotty points had been disposed of, at a late hour I got to bed.\r\n\r\nOn the following morning I left early and went down to the mouth of the\r\nriver to see whether it was possible to cross the bar in order to meet\r\nSir Harry, but found that it was still impassable owing to the heavy\r\nswell that continued to roll in from the open sea. After wasting a good\r\ndeal of time in this vain attempt, I returned to the town, and procured\r\nnine horses, with which I started off overland to Nei, where the ships\r\nwere lying. The road was pretty good in places, but at times very\r\nnarrow, and wound in and out among the hills. The ponies were sturdy\r\nlittle animals, and though unshod trotted over the stones without\r\nstumbling, but they had hard mouths, and would not obey the snaffle. At\r\nNei I got a small boat and went on board. From Sir Harry downwards\r\neveryone was willing to risk the ride to Tokushima, in spite of the\r\nweather. We started at four, and in a couple of hours reached the town,\r\nin a heavy storm of rain and wind. The streams, which had been quite dry\r\nwhen I passed in the middle of the day, were now so swollen that the\r\nwater came up to the ponies' girths. We were wet through. If we changed\r\nat the temple, there was the risk of getting wet again in riding to the\r\ncastle. It was arranged therefore that we should go on as we were, and\r\ndress in an ante-room. Mitford and Aston were engaged in drying their\r\nclothes. I had got into a pair of pyjamas, and could not ride in that\r\ncostume. So I tried to procure three palanquins for us, which took an\r\nunexpectedly long time to produce. Sir Harry lost his temper, and swore\r\nhe would not be kept waiting for all the d----d _daimiôs_ in Japan.\r\n\r\nNumata (my old teacher) and the other Awa people manifested the most\r\nstoical indifference to all this wrath. Mitford volunteered to go on\r\nhorseback, so they set out. Aston, as a punishment for not being ready,\r\nwas forbidden by Sir Harry to join the party, a prohibition which caused\r\nhim the intensest joy. At last my palanquin arrived, I got in, and the\r\nbearers went off at such a pace that I reached the castle at the same\r\nmoment as the others. In the dark, for it was now nine or ten o'clock,\r\nthe walls of cyclopean masonry, as we entered the gates and wound\r\nthrough the outer fortifications, seemed very imposing, though they were\r\nnot so in reality. We had to alight outside the point at which I had\r\nagreed with the officials, but luckily no one seemed to be aware of the\r\nalteration. We got into the palace and were shown into rooms where we\r\nchanged our dress; and the different garb worn by the various members of\r\nthe party was very curious, no proper uniforms or evening dress at all.\r\nI could only muster a shirt, a white coat and trousers, no waistcoat,\r\nand no cummerbund. Sir Harry was the only one who kept his shoes on, as\r\nevery one had got his feet wet in riding from Nei.\r\n\r\nEveryone being at last ready, we were ushered through a series of wide\r\npassages into the banqueting room, and were met by the prince, who\r\naccording to the agreement was clad in the ordinary costume of a\r\ngentleman, wide trousers, gown and mantle of silk. The introductions\r\nfollowed in the proper order of rank, and the prince led the way to the\r\ntables. The top one was oval, having been made months ago when it was\r\nexpected that Mitford and I would be the only guests; the others were\r\nsquare. For the prince and his son there were elaborately carved chairs\r\nof old-fashioned style, for the rest of us there were three-legged\r\nchairs with semi-circular seats, very rickety and badly balanced. We\r\nwere placed with our backs to the alcove (_tokonoma_), this being the\r\nseat of honour, on which the presents were laid out, a magnificent\r\nbronze about two feet high occupying the centre.\r\n\r\nSir Harry and the Admiral gave the prince a couple of revolvers, which\r\nseemed to afford him much pleasure, and the return presents, consisting\r\nof rolls of brocade, crape and so forth, were then announced by one of\r\nthe attendants. Sir Harry, who had by this time quite recovered his\r\nequanimity, made himself very agreeable to the prince, talking on\r\ngeneral topics, instead of dwelling on the \"relations of friendship\r\nwhich happily unite our respective countries\" and the usual diplomatic\r\ncommonplaces. The prince, Awa no Kami, to give him his proper title, was\r\na man of about forty-seven years of age, of middle height, and with a\r\nrefined countenance, slightly pock-marked; his manner abrupt and\r\nimperious, but his good humour without limits. Awaji no Kami, the son,\r\nwas about twenty-two, a little taller than his father, with a mild, fat\r\ncountenance, a gentle and subdued manner; and he exhibited great\r\ndeference towards his father.\r\n\r\nThe usual order of a Japanese dinner was reversed, the rice, soup and\r\nbaked fish being first placed on the table. When this course had been\r\nremoved, drinking commenced, a red lacquer cup being handed first to Sir\r\nHarry. I whispered to Sir Harry to call for the bowl to dip it in, and\r\nhe returned it to the prince, who then offered it to the Admiral and to\r\nCaptain Hewett, and then it travelled down the line to Stephenson, from\r\nwhom it was returned to the prince. There was a good deal of picking at\r\nthe various dishes of the banquet which was placed before us, and a\r\ngreat quantity of _saké_ was drunk. After a while a play was announced,\r\nand in order to get a better view of the acting we moved our chairs down\r\nto the other end of the room, where tables with our plates and drinking\r\ncups were placed before us. The actors were retainers of the prince\r\nwearing the long trousers belonging to the court costume, but not\r\notherwise dressed for their parts. In the first piece there was three\r\ncharacters--master, servant, and guest. The master tells the servant to\r\nimitate him in all things, which injunction he takes literally, and\r\naddresses the guest in exactly the same style as his master employs to\r\nhim; this enrages the master, who cuffs the servant, and he in turn the\r\nguest. This sort of fun continues with variations until the master's\r\npatience is quite exhausted, and he kicks the servant out of the room.\r\n\r\nThe second piece is a well-known one, entitled \"The Three Cripples.\" A\r\nrich and benevolent person advertises for cripples to enter his employ,\r\nand there enter successively a lame, a blind and a dumb man, gamblers\r\nwho having become beggars have adopted these disguises in order to\r\nimpose on the charitable. They are accepted, and having placed them in\r\ncharge of three store-houses, their employer goes out. Then the three\r\nrecognize each other as old comrades, and agree to open one of the\r\nstore-rooms, which is full of _saké_, after which they will rob the\r\nother two. However, they get so drunk that when their master returns\r\neach forgets the part he had previously played; the blind man assumes\r\ndumbness, the lame one blindness, and the dumb pretends to be deaf.\r\nTheir detection of course follows, with the natural consequences.\r\n\r\nAfter the play was over we drew round the little tables, and the _saké_\r\ncup passed freely from hand to hand; Awa no Kami vowed that the Admiral\r\nwas his father, and Sir Harry his elder brother, while Awaji no Kami\r\nexpressed himself to me in a similarly affectionate manner. It was\r\narranged that we should have a review of the troops on the following\r\nday, and about midnight the wind and rain having moderated we took our\r\nleave, getting back to our lodging at one in the morning. I found that\r\neven our servants had not been forgotten, presents having been sent to\r\neach one of them; not a single person was passed over. This was truly\r\nprincely hospitality. I forgot to mention that before we started for the\r\ncastle, a polite message of welcome was brought to Sir Harry from the\r\nprince, accompanied by a box three feet long, one deep and one wide,\r\nfull of eggs, another of the same size full of vermicelli and a basket\r\nof fish. The trouble that had been taken to make us comfortable was very\r\ngreat, even after they had heard of the increased number they would have\r\nto entertain; they had gone to work to make bedsteads and tables, and\r\neven to build bathrooms.\r\n\r\nThe morning turned out finer than could have been reasonably hoped for\r\nafter the storm of the preceding day, and after breakfast we started for\r\nthe parade ground. Our way lay through the castle, and over a\r\nconsiderable stream which washed one side of the fortress. It was a very\r\ngood ground, though rather small, but the prince explained that he could\r\nnot enlarge it without pulling down some Buddhist temples, which would\r\nshock the religious feeling of the townspeople. Some five hundred men,\r\ndivided into five bodies of varying strength, were put through their\r\ndrill. Their uniform was in imitation of European style, black trousers\r\nwith red stripes down the side, and black coats; happy the soldier who\r\ncould muster a pair of boots, the rest had only straw sandals. On their\r\nheads they had hats of papier-maché, either conical or of dish-cover\r\nshape, with two horizontal red bands. They used the English infantry\r\ndrill, with the quaint addition of a shout to indicate the discharge of\r\ntheir firearms. In the opinion of those who were competent to judge,\r\nthey acquitted themselves very creditably. We viewed the evolutions from\r\na sort of grand stand, with tables before us piled up with various\r\ndelicacies. _Saké_ of course formed part of the entertainment, and\r\nHewett was singled out by the prince as assuredly the best toper of us\r\nall, on account of his jolly red face. Everyone this morning had\r\nremarked what a capital liquor is _saké_, it leaves no bad effects\r\nbehind, from which it may be inferred that we had returned home on the\r\nprevious night in a happy frame of mind and body.\r\n\r\nAbout noon we took our leave. Sir Harry presented a ring to the young\r\nprince, and the Admiral put another on the finger of Awa no Kami, to\r\ntheir intense delight. On our way back from the drill ground we were\r\ntaken to a temple on a hill commanding an extensive view, where we were\r\nentertained with a luncheon washed down with bad champagne procured in\r\nYokohama for the occasion. The prince whispered privately into my ear\r\nthat he intended to abdicate and pay a visit to England. To Sir Harry he\r\nsaid all sorts of friendly things about the opening of Hiôgo to foreign\r\ntrade. The Admiral promised to bring the \"Ocean\" and \"Rodney\" to Nei in\r\nthe coming winter to show him what English men-of-war were like. After\r\nreturning to our lodgings we had a substantial lunch off the provisions\r\nbrought from the ships, but our entertainers were not contented till\r\nthey had made us sit down to a final feast prepared by themselves, just\r\nfor five minutes, to drink a farewell cup and receive a parting message\r\nfrom the prince. At last we got away, some on horseback, others in\r\npalanquins, and in three hours after leaving Tokushima we were safely on\r\nboard ship. Sir Harry was accompanied by four principal officials to the\r\n\"Basilisk,\" where Hewett gave them some excellent champagne, and they\r\nwent over the ship's side full of affectionate regrets at having to part\r\nfrom us. The \"Salamis\" left at once for Yokohama with the Admiral,\r\nMitford, Aston and Crossman, while we remained to pursue our voyage to\r\nTosa on the morrow in the \"Basilisk.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XXII\r\n\r\n                           TOSA AND NAGASAKI\r\n\r\n\r\nEARLY on the morning of September 3 we anchored outside the little\r\nharbour of Susaki in Tosa. Inside were lying the Tycoon's war steamer\r\n\"Eagle\" (Kaiten Maru) and a smaller one belonging to the Prince of Tosa.\r\nWe had fully expected a hostile reception, and preparations had been\r\nmade for action. Shortly afterwards Takabataké Gorô and Koméda Keijirô\r\ncame on board to say that Hirayama, the chief commissioner, was up at\r\nKôchi. Gotô Shôjirô, the leading Tosa minister, also paid us a visit,\r\nbut we told him to go away till we could get the ship inside the bay.\r\nThen arrived the other two commissioners (Togawa and an ômetsuké) to\r\ntell us that no evidence implicating any of the Tosa men had been\r\ndiscovered. The little schooner \"Nankai,\" in which the assassins were\r\nsupposed to have escaped from Nagasaki, was lying higher up the bay at\r\nUrado. Later on Gotô came on board with two other local officers. They\r\npromised to do all they could to discover the murderers, even if they\r\nshould not be Tosa men. Sir Harry, who had quite made up his mind that\r\nthe Tosa men were guilty, tried to browbeat them, adding oddly enough\r\nthat with Tosa he could have none but friendly relations; the official\r\ndiscussions must take place with the Tycoon's government. After they\r\nleft, Hirayama made his appearance; a long and stormy interview took\r\nplace, in the course of which he heard a good deal of strong language,\r\nand was told that he was of no more use than a common messenger. He\r\nrecounted to us in a plaintive manner the hardships he had undergone on\r\nthe way down and since his arrival, for the Tosa people were extremely\r\nangry at the suspicions cast on them.\r\n\r\nLater on Sir Harry sent me ashore to see Gotô, and detail to him all the\r\ncircumstances which seemed to us to be evidence against his fellow\r\nclansmen. He renewed the assurances he had given in the morning, and\r\nsaid he felt certain my writer Ono and Noguchi were neither more nor\r\nless than government spies. The next morning I saw Gotô again, who\r\nrenewed his protestations, and complained of Sir Harry's rough language\r\nand demeanour, which he felt sure would some day cause a terrible row. I\r\nwas myself rather sick of being made the intermediary of the overbearing\r\nlanguage to which the chief habitually resorted, and told Gotô to\r\nremonstrate with him, if he really thought this; as for myself, I did\r\nnot dare to hint anything of the kind to my chief. I also saw Hirayama,\r\nand arranged with him that I should be present at the examination of the\r\nofficers of the \"Nankai,\" who were to be sent down from Urado. At three\r\no'clock two small steamers arrived, yet it was seven before the Tycoon's\r\nofficials reached the \"Basilisk\" to say that everything was in\r\nreadiness. As dinner was now announced, the inquiry was put off till the\r\nnext day.\r\n\r\nOn the 5th September the examination was accordingly held in my\r\npresence. On the Japanese side the evidence went to show that the\r\n\"Nankai\" did not leave till ten p.m. on the 6th August, while Sir\r\nHarry's version was that she sailed at half-past four that morning, only\r\nan hour and a half after the schooner; and it was on this alleged fact\r\nthat the whole of the suspicion against the Tosa men was founded. (It\r\nwas proved at the end of 1868 that the murderers belonged to the\r\nChikuzen clan, which was rather an unfortunate conclusion for him.) I\r\nreported this to Sir Harry, who was of course greatly dissatisfied. Gotô\r\nafterwards came on board to see Sir Harry and there was the usual talk\r\nabout cultivating friendly relations between the English and Tosa. Sir\r\nHarry said he wished to send me as his envoy to call formally on the\r\nretired _daimiô_ of Tosa, to which Gotô replied that Sir Harry could\r\nhimself see the ex-_daimiô_, if we were on friendly terms. Otherwise, it\r\nwas useless to hold any communications even by messenger. I knew\r\nperfectly well that I could easily manage to visit Kôchi, if left to\r\nmyself, without the chief taking a roundabout way to get me there under\r\nthe pretext of a mission to the old prince.\r\n\r\nBy this time my relations with the Japanese were such that I could have\r\ngone anywhere with perfect safety. A visit from Hirayama and his\r\ncolleagues came next. The evidence taken was discussed, and Sir Harry\r\nsaid the inquiry must now be removed to Nagasaki, and that Hirayama\r\nought to proceed thither to conduct it. Hirayama objected strongly,\r\noffering to send his two fellow commissioners, but it would not do, and\r\nhe was finally forced to consent. The poor old fellow was almost at his\r\nwit's end. He became actually impertinent, and remarked that after all\r\nthis murder case concerned Englishmen alone, while he had business to\r\ntransact at Yedo which concerned all nations. I was much astonished to\r\nfind that Sir Harry did not get into a passion on being talked to in\r\nthis somewhat unceremonious way by a Japanese, but simply replied to it\r\nin a quiet argumentative tone. But a more curious thing followed.\r\n\r\nAfter dinner Gotô came on board to have a talk on politics. He spoke of\r\nhis idea of establishing a parliament, and a constitution on the English\r\nmodel, and said that Saigô entertained similar notions. That we had\r\nlearnt at Ozaka. Then followed a good deal of abuse of the Tycoon's\r\ngovernment, especially with reference to the proposed formation of a\r\nguild to control the foreign commerce of Ozaka and Hiôgo. We showed him\r\nthe proclamation we had extorted from the government, intended to annul\r\nthe previous one constituting these guilds. He replied that it was a\r\nmere blind, and I confess that I agreed with him. Sir Harry took a great\r\nfancy to him, as being one of the most intelligent Japanese we had as\r\nyet met with, and to my own mind Saigô alone was his superior by force\r\nof character. They swore eternal friendship, and Gotô promised to write\r\nonce a month to report anything that might come to light in connection\r\nwith the \"Icarus\" murder. Last of all he remonstrated with Sir Harry, at\r\nsome length and in very explicit terms, about his rough demeanour on\r\nprevious occasions, and hinted that perhaps others would not have\r\nsubmitted so quietly to such treatment. It was by no means a pleasant\r\ntask for me to put his words into English, especially as Hewett's\r\npresence rendered the rebuke all the more galling, and Sir Harry at\r\nfirst seemed inclined to resent being thus lectured by a Japanese.\r\nHowever he managed to keep his temper, so no bones were broken.\r\n\r\nPoor old Hirayama was made quite ill by the struggle he had had with the\r\nchief, but he did not venture to break his promise to proceed to\r\nNagasaki and pursue the inquiry in person. I now received detailed\r\nwritten instructions from Sir Harry to follow the old fox, as we called\r\nhim, to Nagasaki, to watch the proceedings and stimulate both the\r\nTycoon's officials and the Tosa people to leave no stone unturned in\r\ntheir search for the murderers. Sir Harry himself was obliged to return\r\nto Yedo in the \"Basilisk,\" and it was arranged that I should take a\r\npassage down to Nagasaki in a Tosa steamer, together with the\r\nincriminated officers of the \"Nankai\" and the officials named to conduct\r\nthe inquiry. I was to be clothed with authority equal to that of the\r\nconsul, but was not to interfere in any measures he might think fit to\r\ntake. Sir Harry left on the 6th September, and I transferred myself to\r\nthe Tosa steamer along with my writer and the faithful Noguchi.\r\n\r\nThere I spent the next day, after having seen the Tycoon's war steamer\r\n\"Eagle\" depart with Hirayama on board. In the middle of the night I was\r\nwoken up by a messenger from Gotô, bringing an invitation for me to go\r\nup to Kôchi and make the acquaintance of the ex-_daimiô_. They had sent\r\ndown a tugboat for me, so I went on board at once at four, after a hasty\r\nmeal of rice and tea, and falling asleep on a locker, woke up at\r\ndaylight to find myself already some way from Susaki. We did not anchor\r\nat Urado till half-past nine. The view outside of distant hills and a\r\nbelt of pine trees fringing the shore reminded me strongly of the Bay of\r\nPoint de Galle in Ceylon, where the eastern mail steamers used to call\r\nbefore the construction of the harbour at Colombo.\r\n\r\nKôchi Bay is in reality an estuary, with a very narrow outlet, much\r\nobstructed by rocks. We seemed to be running straight on to the sandy\r\nbeach, when a sudden turn to the left put our head into the river, and\r\nwe came to an anchor in fifteen feet of water inside a little cove. The\r\nriver widens considerably above this point, but is so shallow that only\r\nboats drawing less than a foot of water can go up. I was transferred to\r\na houseboat, which made very slow progress. At last, after traversing\r\ntwo or three broad lake-like reaches, we came in sight of the castle of\r\nKôchi, rendered conspicuous from a distance by its lofty donjon four\r\nstoreys high. Soon afterwards we turned up an embanked canal to the\r\nleft, and touched the shore under a large new building on the outskirts\r\nof the town. Here I was met by Gotô, who told me that the ex-_daimiô_\r\nwould shortly arrive. While waiting for his appearance I changed my\r\ndress, and was introduced to a host of Gotô's colleagues. At last the\r\nex-_daimiô_ Yôdô was announced, and I was conducted upstairs into his\r\npresence. He met me at the threshold, and saluted me by touching the\r\ntips of his toes with the tips of his fingers. I replied by a bow of\r\nexactly equal profundity. We then took our seats, he on a handsome\r\nJapanese armchair with his back to the alcove, and I on a common\r\ncane-bottomed wooden chair opposite, a little lower down to his right.\r\nGotô and some of his fellow councillors squatted on the sill dividing\r\nthe room from that next to it.\r\n\r\nHe began by saying that he had heard my name. I replied by thanking him\r\nfor according me the honour of this interview. He then renewed the\r\nassurances already given through Gotô that if the murderers were Tosa\r\nmen, they should be arrested and punished, and that even if it should\r\nappear that the guilty persons belonged to another clan, he would not\r\nrelax his efforts to trace them out. He had received a letter from the\r\nTycoon stating that he had heard there was strong evidence against Tosa,\r\nand advising him to punish the offenders. This of course he would be\r\nready to do, supposing that the murderers were men of his clan, but he\r\ndid not understand what the Tycoon meant by \"evidence.\" I replied that\r\nwe supposed the government to be in possession of proofs which they had\r\nnot disclosed, as it was not likely that they were convinced simply by\r\nwhat Sir Harry had said to them. Perhaps, I added, they threw the\r\nsuspicion on Tosa in order to get rid of an unpleasant discussion. This\r\nremark called forth from Gotô somewhat unmeasured expressions of\r\nindignation, and he announced his intention of giving the government a\r\npiece of his mind on the subject. Old Yôdô said that he had received a\r\nletter from a friend advising him to try and compromise the matter, as\r\nthe English were greatly incensed at the murder of their men, but he\r\nwould do nothing of the kind. If his people were guilty he would punish\r\nthem; he could do no more; but if they were innocent he would declare\r\ntheir innocence through thick and thin.\r\n\r\nMatsuné Dzusho (the chief man of Uwajima) had told Iyo no Kami that Sir\r\nHarry had said the Tycoon's government had assured him of Tosa's guilt.\r\nI replied again that from the language of the Tycoon's ministers we\r\ncould not help inferring that they had independent grounds for their\r\nsuspicions. Yôdô remarked that the only thing Hirayama had alleged was\r\nthe supposed transfer of men from the schooner \"Yokobuyé\" to the steamer\r\n\"Nankai,\" which had never been proved. I answered that this was all we\r\nhad to go upon, but I should consider that we had good reason to blush\r\nif after all we had said the men should turn out to belong to another\r\nclan; at present I saw no ground for supposing that we were mistaken.\r\n\r\nAn argument then ensued between Gotô and myself as to the nature of\r\nsuspiciousness in general, and what might be held to be sufficient\r\njustification for that attitude of mind; in the end he admitted that we\r\nwere entitled, by our past experience, to mistrust all Japanese _à\r\npriori_, though he maintained that in the present case the rule did not\r\napply. After this Yôdô and Gotô plied me with questions about the\r\nLuxemburg affair, the constitution and powers of parliament and the\r\nelectoral system; it was evident that the idea of a constitution\r\nresembling that of Great Britain had already taken deep root in their\r\nminds. Later on a proposition was actually made to either Mitford or\r\nmyself, I forget which, to enter the service of the Mikado and assist in\r\norganizing their parliament for them.\r\n\r\nHuge dishes of fish were now placed on the table, and waiting women,\r\n_coiffées_ in the exaggerated style of the _daimiôs'_ courts, poured out\r\nthe _saké_. While we drank and conversed, a pair of anatomical models of\r\nthe male and female human being, life size, were exhibited and taken to\r\npieces for my especial edification! Rice was afterwards served in the\r\nnext room, Yôdô excusing himself on the ground of indisposition. The\r\nfact was, he preferred to remain alone with the _saké_ bottle, of which\r\nhe was notoriously fond. I had once in my possession a scroll of Chinese\r\nverses from his brush, signed \"Drunken old man\" (_sui-ô_).\r\n\r\nBefore taking my departure, I saw him once more for a few minutes, when\r\nhe presented me with seven rolls of white crape. Under the circumstances\r\nI should have preferred to decline them, but Gotô argued that they were\r\na part of the entertainment, and I could not refuse without being\r\nungracious, almost discourteous. I therefore accepted, subject to the\r\nchief's approval, and we parted, with the same exchange of formal bows\r\nas before.\r\n\r\nYôdô was a tall man, slightly pock-marked, with bad teeth, and a hurried\r\nmanner of getting out his words. He certainly looked very ill, and\r\nover-indulgence in _saké_ would quite account for that. From some of the\r\nremarks he made, I gathered that he was free from prejudice, and not by\r\nany means conservative in his political notions. Still, it may be\r\ndoubted whether he was prepared to go the same lengths as Satsuma and\r\nChôshiû in the direction of change.\r\n\r\nIt was not considered advisable or safe for me to promenade through the\r\ntown, and I made no attempt to insist on doing the sights. As I returned\r\nback to Urado in the gondola, multitudes of people followed in small\r\nboats, anxious to get a sight of the first European that had visited\r\ntheir part of the country since the wreck of the Spanish galleon in\r\n1596, and even grappling with us in order better to satisfy their\r\ncuriosity. No order was kept, and I was easily convinced that a walk in\r\nKôchi itself might have given rise to a tumult.\r\n\r\nNext day they took me to Susaki, and put me on board the \"Shooeyleen,\"\r\nthe steamer in which we were to proceed to Nagasaki. For the past two\r\ndays I had been suffering from a whitlow on one of the fingers of the\r\nright hand, and felt utterly indifferent to all that passed around me.\r\nBad food, a dirty cabin, excessive heat, sullen fellow-voyagers were all\r\naccepted with the calmness of exhausted misery. The \"Shooeyleen's\"\r\nboilers were old, and we steamed along at the rate of two knots an hour.\r\nLuckily the weather was calm, otherwise there was every reason to think\r\nwe must have gone to the bottom. Passing through Shimonoséki, I went on\r\nshore to ask after old friends, and found Inouyé Bunda, who was a\r\nperfect sink of taciturnity. There was no appearance here of guns or\r\nmen-of-war, nothing to indicate that Chôshiû was still at war with the\r\nTycoon; but all around were signs of peace and prosperity. The Tosa\r\nofficers also landed, one and all, on some pretext or other, and the\r\nwhole day was spent at anchor. Towards evening we set forth again in the\r\nsame leisurely fashion, and reached Nagasaki on the 12th September late\r\nin the afternoon. Here I put up with Marcus Flowers, the consul. At\r\ndinner that evening I met for the first time the well-known Kido\r\nJunichirô, otherwise Katsura Kogorô, who came to the consulate together\r\nwith Itô Shunsuké, whom I had known since 1864. Katsura was remarkable\r\nfor his gentle suave manner, though under this there lay a character of\r\nthe greatest courage and determination, both military and political. We\r\nhad some talk after dinner about politics, but I think they mistrusted\r\nme. At any rate they thought it necessary to assert that their prince\r\nwas a much wronged, innocent and harmless individual, who had never\r\nentertained any schemes for overturning the Tycoon's government. But we\r\nhad long been in possession of indisputable evidence that the abolition\r\nof the Shôgunate was the cardinal point in the policy pursued by the\r\nwestern _daimiôs_ acting in concert.\r\n\r\nOn the following day Flowers and I went to meet Hirayama at the\r\ncustom-house. The two governors were also present. Though they had been\r\nseverely blamed by Sir Harry, they did not appear to be particularly\r\ndisturbed by his censures. The Tosa steamer \"Nankai\" had left, in fact\r\nshe steamed out of the harbour just after Sir Harry went off in the\r\n\"Basilisk.\" On the 19th of August, as she was about to leave for\r\nKagoshima, she was stopped, and an examination was held, which lasted\r\nthrough the night until the afternoon of the 20th, but without any\r\nevidence of complicity in the murders being elicited. The officers and\r\ncrew were then entrusted to the charge of Iwasaki Yatarô, Tosa's agent\r\n(_kiki-yaku_), who undertook to produce them whenever they should be\r\nwanted. But she sailed the same evening, in defiance of Iwasaki's\r\norders, at least so the Tosa people alleged. Nothing had been discovered\r\nwith respect to the real criminals, and, as far as we could see, the\r\ngovernors had not exerted themselves to find out the guilty persons.\r\n\r\nThe 14th I spent with Itô and Katsura at a tea-house called Tamagawa,\r\naway at the back of the town close to the stream which flows down\r\nthrough it. We had a long discussion on Japanese politics, domestic and\r\nforeign, ending with the conclusion that Europeans and Japanese would\r\nnever mix, at least not in our time. On my way back I called on Hikozô\r\n(the well-known Joseph Heco), who told me of a document, said to be\r\nsigned by Satsuma, Tosa, Geishiû, Bizen and Awa, which had been\r\npresented to the Shôgun Keiki, requiring him to resign his office and\r\nallow the government to be reconstituted.\r\n\r\nOn Sunday the 15th I lunched with Hirayama. He said that Sasaki\r\nSanshirô, the Tosa _metsuké_ (equivalent to attorney-general, but not\r\ntrained in law), was overruled by the Tosa society called the\r\n_Kai-yen-tai_, a sort of local navy league, who would not allow him to\r\ncarry out the official orders received from his prince to have search\r\nmade for the criminals. This was natural enough, as it was afterwards\r\nproved that the Tosa men were altogether innocent of the affair.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: KATSU AWA NO KAMI\r\n    Commissioner of the Navy]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: NIIRO GIÔBU, SATSUMA KARÔ]\r\n\r\nThe 16th was spent at the custom house in the examination of the men of\r\nthe \"Yokobuyé,\" a Tosa sailing-vessel. It appeared certain that the\r\n\"Nankai\" did not leave Nagasaki till the evening of the 6th August. Two\r\nof the _Kai-yen-tai_, one of whom was the captain of the \"Yokobuyé,\"\r\nwere shown to have been at a house of entertainment opposite to the spot\r\nwhere the British sailors were murdered up to midnight. This looked\r\nsuspicious, but I told the Japanese officials that if they did not\r\ndisbelieve the statements that had been made, neither did I. The Tosa\r\npeople did not want to make the \"Yokobuyé\" return, neither did the\r\ngovernment officials seem to insist on her recall. As my plan was to\r\nthrow on the government officials the responsibility of discovering the\r\nmurderers, I did not urge it, but left it to Flowers, who was associated\r\nwith me in the inquiry, to do so if he judged it necessary.\r\n\r\nIn the evening of the 18th I went to see Hirayama, and communicated to\r\nhim my suspicions regarding a young fellow of forbidding countenance,\r\nwho was with the captain of the \"Yokobuyé\" on the night of the murder at\r\nthe house of entertainment referred to. I suggested that his companion\r\nshould be sent for, and also the four men stated to have gone to Karatsu\r\n(in the north of Hizen, near the boundary of Chikuzen) in the \"Nankai,\"\r\nand to have landed there. I advised that the keeper of the house of\r\nentertainment should be examined, and asked for copies of all\r\ndepositions received, especially of the two Tosa men. What had fixed\r\nsuspicion upon men of that province in particular was their general evil\r\nreputation as being predisposed towards assassination. The depositions\r\nwere sent to us by the governors in the afternoon of the 19th, and on\r\ndiscrepancies being pointed out in those of the two Tosa men, they\r\npromised to send for one of them whose further examination appeared to\r\nbe especially desirable. The translation of the depositions occupied me\r\nfor the whole of the succeeding day. Then on the 21st I went to see\r\nNiiro Giôbu, a Satsuma _karô_, and asked him to make an inquiry about\r\nthe murder among his own people. He said this had already been done, and\r\noffered to give me a copy of the record. As he said that nothing\r\nsuspicious had been discovered, I declined his offer with thanks. But I\r\nhinted to him the possibility of the exclusion of all two-sworded men\r\nfrom the foreign settlement after dark, unless the murderers were\r\ndiscovered and delivered up by the combined clans, a measure which had\r\nbeen recommended to Flowers and myself by Sir Harry, for if the\r\ndiscovery were made by the government, it would be taken to be a proof\r\nof the complicity of his clan at least. He did not at all like this\r\nsuggestion. Then I went to Sasaki Sanshirô, with whom I had travelled\r\nfrom Tosa. He said that the governors had lent a steamer to fetch the\r\ncaptain of the \"Yokobuyé\" and another man, and complained of Hirayama's\r\nsupposition that he was lukewarm, seeing that he had given money to all\r\nthe detectives in the place, and had offered a reward of 4000 pieces of\r\nsilver (worth £450) for the discovery of the murderer or murderers.\r\n\r\nNext to Hirayama, to whom I proposed that he should order the Nagasaki\r\nrepresentatives of all the clans to examine their men as strictly as the\r\nTosa agents were doing, for as we had been ten days at work without\r\nbeing able to fix the responsibility on them, it was not unreasonable to\r\nadmit the possibility of men of some other clan being guilty. I proposed\r\nthat every two-sworded man should be called upon to give an account of\r\nhis doings on the night of the murder, and that all the houses of\r\nentertainment should show their lists of guests on that date. There was,\r\nI said, no real difficulty in discovering the perpetrators. In\r\nconsequence of all this one of the governors called the next afternoon.\r\nWe proposed to him that the two-sworded men should be excluded from the\r\nsettlement after dark, to which he added an amendment that if they had\r\nurgent business there in the evening, they should be escorted to and\r\nfro. The examination of all the clansmen and of persons who were in a\r\nhouse of entertainment close to the site of the murder was again urged\r\nby us. The governor also promised to have guard-houses erected at three\r\npoints in the foreign settlement.\r\n\r\nTwo days later the same governor called again, and promised that the\r\nprecautionary measures we had proposed to him should be taken. Nothing\r\nfurther was done until the 28th, when I attended at the custom house to\r\nhear the examination of two Tosa men who had been brought from Kôchi in\r\nthe government steamer. It led to this result, that the governors\r\ndeclared that they found nothing to incriminate any of the men who had\r\nleft Nagasaki in the \"Yokobuyé\" and \"Nankai,\" and considered the Tosa\r\npeople to be cleared of all suspicion as far as these two vessels were\r\nconcerned. We rejoined that on the contrary we entertained very strong\r\nsuspicions, not founded on any ocular testimony, but on circumstantial\r\nevidence, namely, that the murder was almost certainly committed by men\r\nin white foreign dress a little after midnight. That one of the two men\r\nwith a companion were close to the spot where the murder was committed\r\nat the very moment, and that they were dressed in that fashion, and that\r\nno one else had been shown to have been in the brothel quarter in\r\nsimilar costume. We afterwards addressed a letter to the governors\r\ndemanding the arrest of these two men on the above grounds, but we were\r\nnot sanguine of obtaining their consent, as it was evident that the\r\ngovernment officials were unable to exercise any control over the Tosa\r\npeople.\r\n\r\nVery little progress was made after this, as was natural enough, seeing\r\nthat the Tosa people were entirely innocent of any share in the murders,\r\nas was afterwards proved. On October 6 I had an opportunity of\r\nconversing amicably with the vice-governor. I said that the Tosa people\r\ntried to throw obstacles in the way of discovering the criminals,\r\ninstead of courting inquiry in accordance with Prince Yôdô's expressed\r\nwishes. That the government had lost much ground with foreigners in this\r\naffair. Firstly, the possibility of the murder being committed in such a\r\nmanner showed the incapacity of the government to maintain order, and,\r\nsecondly, it was not fitting that a body calling itself a government\r\nshould allow _daimiôs_ to enjoy such rights of extraterritoriality to\r\nthe extent that was shown by the recent examinations at the\r\ncustom-house. The vice-governor replied that he had nothing to do with\r\nthese matters, to which I rejoined that this was precisely the reason\r\nwhy I had spoken to him about them. We received a refusal to our demand\r\nfor the arrest of the two Tosa men. A few days later a drunken\r\nEnglishman was cut about the head and an American wounded slightly in\r\nthe arm by a Tosa man, who straightway gave himself up to his own\r\nauthorities, and they reported the affair. Having failed entirely in our\r\nattempts to bring the crime home to the Tosa people, Flowers and I\r\nagreed that it was useless for me to remain any longer, and accordingly\r\nI returned to Yedo, leaving about midnight of the 12th October on board\r\nH.M.S. \"Coquette,\" which had been lent by the Admiral to bring me back\r\nto Yokohama.\r\n\r\nDuring my stay at Nagasaki we heard a good deal about the discovery and\r\narrest of native Roman Catholic Christians of Urakami, a village near\r\nthe town. Niiro Giôbu of Satsuma, who came to see me on the 12th\r\nOctober, said that besides the Urakami people, some of the inhabitants\r\nof a village close by, belonging to the _daimiô_ of Omura, had been\r\nconverted, and were now in prison at Nagasaki. According to Japanese law\r\nthis was a capital offence. The Omura officials had hitherto conformed\r\nto the practice of the Nagasaki government with respect to the\r\npunishment of criminals, and desired to act accordingly in the present\r\ncase. It was, however, reported that the governors intended to pardon\r\nall those who were willing to abjure, because the number of offenders\r\nwas so large. This offended the Omura officials, who held that believing\r\nin Christianity was a very grave crime; further, that the proposal to\r\nlet such criminals off on the pretext that they were too numerous to\r\npunish was revolutionary and subversive of good government, and they\r\nwere endeavouring to induce all the _daimiôs_ of Kiûshiû to join in a\r\nrepresentation in that sense to the government at Yedo. This proposal\r\nwas of course intended as a general manifesto against the Shôgun's\r\ngovernment. I replied that he must quite well know that Christianity was\r\nnot harmful to any country by whose people it was professed, and that\r\neven a Protestant government such as that of England would not be\r\npleased to hear of Roman Catholics being persecuted on the ground of\r\ntheir religious belief, but if the only object of the remonstrance was\r\nto annoy the Shôgun's government, we should not disapprove of that by\r\nitself. On the general subject of Japanese internal politics, he said he\r\ndid not believe that civil war would break out, or at least he pretended\r\nnot to, though at the same time he acknowledged its possibility.\r\nHirayama, to whom I said good-bye on the same day, told me that all the\r\nChristians of Urakami had been forgiven on their promising \"not to do so\r\nagain,\" and that they would be permitted to believe what they liked,\r\ndoubtless on condition of their not professing their religion openly. He\r\nthought the Omura officials would also forgive their Christians. This\r\nopinion of his was, however, in contradiction to what I had heard from\r\nNiiro.\r\n\r\nMy stay at Nagasaki afforded me useful opportunities of making the\r\nacquaintance of _samurai_ of various southern clans. I have already\r\nmentioned my introduction to Kido Junichirô.\r\n\r\nThe 14th I spent almost entirely in the company of Kido and Itô. A few\r\ndays later Kido called to offer me the use of a steamer to Ozaka, if it\r\nsuited me to return to Yedo by that route, but I deferred accepting, as\r\nmy plans were not yet settled. Eventually arrangements were made for my\r\nbeing conveyed to Yokohama in one of H.M. ships, so that I was able to\r\ndecline his obliging proposal. When Itô came to say good-bye on\r\nSeptember 23, he was accompanied by a young fellow-clansman whom he\r\nwished me to take to Yedo, nominally as a pupil. This was Endo Kinsuké,\r\none of the party of five Chôshiû men to which Itô had belonged, who went\r\nsecretly to England in 1863, as already narrated. He bore the alias of\r\nYamamoto Jinsuké. Itô's pseudonym was Hayashi Uichi, and Inouyé Bunda\r\nwent by the name of Takada Harutarô. Amongst other interesting\r\ninformation given to me by Itô was that my friend Yamagata Keizô, who\r\nwas one of the Chôshiû men that had accompanied me to Yokohama in\r\nOctober 1864, had been adopted by Shishido Bizen. It was his father,\r\nYamagata Taiga, who wrote the pamphlet of which the title translated is\r\nthe equivalent of \"The present _daimiôs_ are not vassals of the prince,\"\r\n_i.e._ of the Shôgun, and not Nagai Uta, to whom it was usually\r\nattributed. Itô was a pupil of the well-known patriot Yoshida Torajirô,\r\nthe author of several books controverting the views of Yamagata and\r\nNagai. He said there were two schools of Chinese philosophy in Japan,\r\nnamely, of Teishi (Ch'êng-tzu) and Oyômei (Wang Yang-ming), of which the\r\nfirst inculcates the duty of resisting tyrants, the second that of\r\nself-reformation. Yamagata belonged to the latter, hence his arguments\r\nagainst any attempt to disturb the existing political arrangements. (But\r\nthe most widely diffused system in Japan was that of the philosopher Chu\r\nHsi.)\r\n\r\nNiiro Giôbu I saw four times. I dined with him once at a Japanese\r\nrestaurant, when he said that he knew nothing of the engagement of\r\nFrenchmen by Iwashita Sajiemon, a Satsuma man who had gone to Paris for\r\nthe exposition of 1867, and there came under the influence of the Comte\r\nde Montblanc. Directly he heard of it he wrote to Iwashita that the\r\nengagements must be cancelled, but his letter did not reach Paris in\r\ntime. I said that of course we could not object to Satsuma employing\r\nFrenchmen, but as French views of Japanese domestic politics differed so\r\nwidely from ours, and it was well understood that ours coincided to a\r\ncertain extent with those of Satsuma, it was natural to ask whether this\r\nengagement implied a change of policy on the part of the Satsuma clan.\r\nNiiro replied that such a supposition would be quite natural, but that\r\nin fact no such change had occurred. Since the time when Osumi no Kami\r\n(father of the Prince of Satsuma, and virtual ruler of the clan\r\nnotwithstanding his formal retirement from public life) had decreed the\r\nadoption of English methods, the whole province had become enthusiastic\r\nin their favour, and objected very strongly to the proposed introduction\r\nof Frenchmen. He was afraid he should have to send them home again. A\r\nfew days later Niiro dined with Russell Robertson (assistant at the\r\nconsulate) and myself at Robertson's house, when we engaged a French\r\ncook to serve the dinner. On this occasion no political conversation\r\ntook place, but he told us that Saigô was Osumi no Kami's confidential\r\nman, and Komatsu Tatéwaki one of the seven _shussei_ (administrators) of\r\nthe Satsuma clan. The prince, whose title was Shiuri no Taiyu, was 29\r\nyears of age, and his brother, Shimadzu Dzusho, 28. Altogether there\r\nwere ten brothers and sisters, besides the three girls of the late\r\nprince, Satsuma no Kami. My last talk with Niiro was on October 12, when\r\nhe gave me information about the native Christians, already recorded.\r\n\r\nLast year I had met at Robertson's house a doctor belonging to the\r\nKurumé clan, and he now came with his son to ask permission to bring\r\nsome of his fellow clansmen to call on me. This they did on the 8th\r\nOctober. Their names were Imae Sakai, said to be connected with the\r\ngovernment of the clan; Nagata Chiûhei, who was visiting Nagasaki for\r\nthe first time in his life; and Tanaka Konoyé. Originally a Kiôto\r\nclockmaker, he had developed into a skilled mechanical engineer, and had\r\nconstructed engines and boilers for a couple of Japanese steamers. After\r\ndrinking a bottle of champagne together, we sallied forth to a Japanese\r\nrestaurant, where we had a little feast in the style of the country, and\r\na great deal of political talk. They said their principal reason for\r\nobjecting to Hiôgo being opened as a port for foreign trade was that the\r\ntea consumed at Kurumé came from the provinces to the west of Hiôgo, and\r\nthey feared it would be diverted to that place for exportation. With\r\nregard to internal affairs, I said I did not see how they could be\r\nsettled without a war of some kind or other, as the _daimiôs_ could not\r\nagree among themselves. A civil war might last twenty or thirty years,\r\nand greatly impoverish the country, while it would afford an opportunity\r\nto foreign powers to appropriate bits of Japanese territory by aiding\r\none party against the other. But a foreign war, in which Kiôto became\r\nthe object of attack, would lead to the reconciliation of their internal\r\ndifferences, and when peace came to be made we could conclude treaties\r\nwith the Mikado, in which the constitutional position of the Tycoon\r\nmight be defined.\r\n\r\nNagata, who was already drunk, shouted out: \"You must not attack Kiôto,\r\nbut destroy the _Baku-fu_.\" This was the term, meaning \"military power,\"\r\nby which the adversaries of the Tycoon were in the habit of speaking of\r\nhis government. It appeared from this utterance that the men of Kurumé\r\nshared what was evidently the general feeling in the west of the\r\ncountry. Afterwards we adjourned to another restaurant, where a grand\r\nfeast was served. More of the Kurumé clan came in, and the room was\r\ngradually filled with courtesans and musicians. Most of my friends got\r\nvery drunk, so after about two hours of this festivity I left, and the\r\nparty broke up. I also had a dinner with a Tosa man named Yui, who was\r\ncaptain of the \"Yugawo.\"\r\n\r\nAnother acquaintance I made was that of Hosokawa Riônosuké, younger\r\nbrother of the Prince of Higo, who came to call on Flowers. He had a fat\r\nround face, was about 25 years of age, and intelligent. He tried to pump\r\nme about the Tosa affair but failed, and when he proceeded to talk\r\npolitics I held my tongue, for Higo was supposed not to belong to the\r\nSatsuma party. He then invited me to visit him on board his steamer and\r\nhave a long conversation, but when I went at the appointed hour on the\r\nfollowing day he was absent. However, next day two of his men called to\r\napologize for his breaking the engagement, and he also appeared in\r\nperson to tell me of the desire cherished by the Higo people to invite\r\nSir Harry Keppel, the Admiral in command of the China squadron, to some\r\npoint off their coast to display naval evolutions; for the clan having\r\nordered an iron-clad man-of-war and two smaller war steamers to be built\r\nin England, wanted to learn how they should be manoeuvred. He was at\r\ngreat pains to prove that he was on the best of terms with Kido (_alias_\r\nKatsura), and that the Hosokawa brothers loved the English more than\r\nthey did any other nation, for all their steamers, besides 16,000 rifles\r\nof different patterns, had been bought from us. I replied that their\r\ninviting the Admiral to a place off their coast and not to the castle at\r\nKumamoto, was like sending for a troupe of tumblers to perform before\r\none's house, into which one would not care to admit them. If a man were\r\nprevented from inviting a guest to his own house, it would be more\r\ncourteous to go and call on him than to ask him to come half-way, and\r\nthat Riônosuké at least ought to come to Nagasaki and visit the Admiral\r\nfirst of all. He said he intended going to Shimonoséki with one of the\r\nHigo _karô_ (councillor) to arrange an alliance between Higo and\r\nChôshiû.\r\n\r\nEndo presented himself on the 12th, but instead of coming straight to\r\nme, he sent in his card by my Aidzu retainer Noguchi, who read it and at\r\nonce discovered who he was. We embarked in the course of the evening,\r\nand steamed out of the harbour at eleven p.m. through the inland sea,\r\nand without calling anywhere, arrived at Yokohama at midnight on the\r\n16th.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XXIII\r\n\r\n                       DOWNFALL OF THE SHOGUNATE\r\n\r\n\r\nBEFORE leaving Yedo I had taken a lease of a house known as\r\n_Taka-yashiki_ (high mansion) on a bluff overlooking the bay, at a\r\nmonthly rental of 100 _ichibus_, equal to £6 13s. 4. It was the retired\r\nhome of a Japanese gentleman of rank, who had abdicated his position in\r\nfavour of his eldest son, and had bought a piece of ground to build\r\nhimself a residence after his own taste. Consequently it was one of the\r\noddest houses imaginable, consisting of a number of small rooms of\r\nvarying sizes, and the garden was laid out in little hills and\r\ngrass-plots, planted with trees and shrubs. The only flowers were those\r\nof the camellia and St John's wort bushes (Hypericum Chinense), for\r\nherbaceous borders are almost impossible to manage in Japan, owing to\r\nthe heavy summer rains, which beat down all plants that have not woody\r\nstems. The whole covered about two-thirds of an acre. There was an upper\r\nstorey, where I had my bedroom and apartments for the entertainment of\r\nJapanese guests, and three staircases provided means of escape in case\r\nof attack from the midnight murderer. Downstairs was a room for the\r\nreception of European visitors, and two waiting rooms for callers, one\r\nmore for the accommodation of my head man and my own study. This was\r\nnine feet square, with a circular window commanding a view of the sea,\r\nand a square one at the side overlooking the garden. It was fitted up\r\nwith numerous small cupboards and shelves for the accommodation of books\r\nand papers. It held a writing desk, a small table, a chair for myself\r\nand one for my Japanese teacher, and a stool for the Chinese teacher\r\nattached to the legation. There were also a large bathroom, a kitchen,\r\nand a two-storeyed building beyond where my head man lived, and where\r\nthe young Japanese to whom I intended to teach English were to be\r\nlodged. My food was entirely in the Japanese style, sent in from the\r\nwell-known house called Mansei, but I continued to drink English beer.\r\nThe household consisted of my head man (the Aidzu _samurai_, Noguchi,\r\nwho has been already mentioned), whose function was to superintend\r\neverything, pay my bills, arrange for necessary repairs, and receive\r\npersons who came on business which did not require a personal interview\r\nwith myself. Next to him came a small boy of fourteen who waited at\r\ntable and acted as valet. He was of the _samurai_ class, and so entitled\r\nto wear sword and dagger when he went abroad. Then there was a woman of\r\nabout thirty years of age, whose duty it was to sweep the floors, open\r\nthe sliding shutters in the morning and close them at night, and sew on\r\nmy buttons. As there was hardly any furniture, she had very little\r\ndusting to do. I was to engage a man to go, not run, on errands, perhaps\r\ncook the rice for the whole family, and make himself generally useful.\r\nLastly came a gatekeeper, who had also the duty of sweeping the garden,\r\nand a groom or running footman. When I went out walking or on horseback,\r\nI was accompanied by a couple of the mounted escort that had been\r\nattached to me by the Tycoon's government since my journey overland from\r\nOzaka in the earlier part of the year.\r\n\r\nThus established as a householder after my own liking, able to devote\r\nmyself to Japanese studies and to live intimately with Japanese and thus\r\nbecome acquainted with their thoughts and views, I was perfectly happy.\r\nIn my journal I find noted down a dinner on November 6 with Nakamura\r\nMatazô at the Sanku-tei near Shimbashi, with _geisha_ of course to pour\r\nout the _saké_ and entertain us with music and bright conversation, and\r\non the 7th a dinner of broiled eels and rice at the Daikokuya,\r\nReiganbashi, with Yanagawa Shunsan, a teacher at the foreign language\r\nschool (_kaiseijo_). The political ferment threw a great deal of work on\r\nme in interpreting for Sir Harry in his talks with government people,\r\nand in translating official papers from and into Japanese, and these\r\nduties often occupied me from nine o'clock in the morning till nine in\r\nthe evening, with only short intervals for meals.\r\n\r\nIn the dead of night on November 16 Ishikawa Kawachi no Kami, one of the\r\ncommissioners for foreign affairs, came to impart to Sir Harry the\r\nmomentous news that the Tycoon had resigned the direction of government\r\ninto the hands of the Mikado, and in future would simply be the\r\ninstrument for carrying out His Majesty's orders. We had heard from\r\nother sources that he had abdicated, and that the office of Shôgun would\r\ncease to exist. Already on the 14th Ogasawara Iki no Kami had told us\r\nconfidentially that the programme of the future consisted of a council\r\nof the great _daimiôs_, decision by the Tycoon subject to the approval\r\nof the Mikado.[4] The actual date of Keiki's resignation was November 8.\r\n\r\n    [4] For the detailed circumstances of this event I must refer\r\n        the reader to Chapter V. of my friend Mr. J. H. Gubbins'\r\n        valuable volume \"The Progress of Japan, 1853-1871.\"\r\n\r\nAt an interview with Sir Harry two days afterwards, Iki no Kami read out\r\na long paper explaining the causes which had led to the Tycoon's\r\ndecision to surrender the government into the hands of the Mikado. He\r\nwent into a long retrospect of affairs from the commencement of the\r\nrenewed intercourse with foreign nations. The blame was, of course,\r\nthrown on the agitators for political change. Keiki, it said, had not\r\nresigned the chieftainship of the Tokugawa clan, but had simply\r\nabolished the office of Shôgun. The new arrangement would not involve\r\nany change in the previous agreements about the opening of the new ports\r\nwhich had been entered into earlier in the year. Two of the Council of\r\nState, Nui no Kami and Hiôbu Taiyu, were off to Kiôto.\r\n\r\nKatsu Awa no Kami told us that he was afraid that the Tycoon's party\r\nwould precipitate events, and cause the outbreak of civil war. Kanéko\r\nTaisuké, a retainer of Sakai Hida no Kami, told us that the _daimiôs_\r\nwere collecting troops at Ozaka. Satsuma had 5000 men, and Chôshiû and\r\nTosa men, under the command of Môri Nagato, were also encamped there, so\r\nthat we should find ourselves in a hornets' nest when we went down to\r\nsuperintend the opening of the ports. The Tycoon had ordered 4000 or\r\n5000 men to be despatched thither. The Council of State had informed his\r\nchief and Matsudaira Hôki no Kami that in future they might be Tycoon's\r\nor Mikado's men as they liked. A secret circular had been sent round\r\namong the _hatamoto_ (retainers of the Tokugawa chief holding fiefs\r\nassessed at less than 10,000 _koku_ of rice) inciting them against\r\nKeiki, by accusing him of having poisoned the previous Shôgun Iyémochi,\r\nand calling upon the faithful to assemble at Mukôjima, a suburb of Yedo.\r\nThe _sampei_ or drilled troops were clamouring for their pay. Civil war\r\nat Kiôto was inevitable.\r\n\r\nTruly it seemed as if the end of the old régime had come.\r\n\r\nA week later Iki no Kami circulated another paper to be substituted for\r\nthe first, in which he had vented a little too much abuse of the\r\nanti-Tycoon party. Matters had quieted down very much in the interval.\r\nKanéko also came to us and confessed that there was no foundation for\r\nthe rumours he had previously reported. Last night there arrived a\r\nletter from Gotô Shôjirô, brought by Gotô Kiûjirô, one of the aliases of\r\nhim whom we afterwards knew so well as Nakai Kôzô, and a companion. They\r\nproduced a copy of the Tosa memorial of last month, advising the Tycoon\r\nto take the step he had since adopted, and proposing various reforms. Of\r\nthese the most important were the establishment of an assembly composed\r\nof two houses, the erection of schools of science and literature in the\r\nprincipal cities, and the negotiation of new treaties with foreign\r\npowers. They asked me for detailed information about parliamentary\r\npractice, which I did not possess, so I put them off by promising that\r\nthey should get it from Mitford when we went to Ozaka for the opening of\r\nthe ports. They were succeeded the following day by a messenger from\r\nYoshii Kôsuké of Satsuma, to report that all was going on well, and that\r\nthey hoped to be \"favoured with a call\" as soon as we reached Ozaka.\r\nSaigô and Komatsu had gone down to Kagoshima to fetch either Osumi no\r\nKami or Shiuri no Taiyu.\r\n\r\nWe had now become acquainted with the Satsuma agents in Yedo; the\r\n_rusui_ (as the principal representative of a _daimiô_ was called)\r\nShinosaki Hikojirô scoffed at the notion that the Tycoon had given up\r\nthe reins of government because he thought it would be better for the\r\ncountry at large to be ruled by an assembly; the fact was that he could\r\nnot help himself. Messages arrived by post from Tosa and Satsuma, the\r\n\"two or three clans acquainted with the dispositions of foreigners\"\r\nmentioned in the Mikado's most recent edict respecting foreign affairs.\r\nThis seemed to indicate a pretty strong desire to gain our support. We\r\nnow prepared to start for Ozaka. On the 27th November I went down to\r\nYokohama with my little pupil, Tetsu, dressed like a drummer-boy.\r\nMitford and I sailed on the 30th at daylight in H.M.S. \"Rattler,\"\r\nCaptain Swann. On December 2, as we were steaming up the Kii channel, we\r\nencountered a strong northwest breeze, against which the ship could only\r\ndo two knots, so deficient in boiler-power were the British men-of-war\r\nof that period. We anchored off Ozaka in the afternoon, and as no boats\r\nput off from the shore, we had to conclude that the bar was impassable.\r\nHowever, we managed to get ashore about noon, and proceeded to call on\r\nthe governors at their official residence opposite the castle. It is a\r\nremarkable proof of Mitford's linguistic powers that he was able to\r\ncarry on the conversation in Japanese entirely unaided, although he had\r\nbeen in the country no longer than twelve months.\r\n\r\nOur mission was to find quarters for the legation, and after\r\nconsultation with them we went to inspect a _yashiki_ behind the castle,\r\nwhich had been occupied in the spring by Iga no Kami, Keiki's principal\r\nminister. We arranged for its repair, and for the construction of a\r\ntemporary barrack for the mounted escort and a detachment of fifty men\r\nof the 9th regiment, who were to arrive as a guard. Everything was to be\r\nready by the 18th if possible. This peaceable and entirely commercial\r\ncity was full of two-sworded retainers of _daimiôs_. Finding that Saigô\r\nhad not yet returned from Kagoshima, and that Yoshii was in Kiôto, we\r\nwrote to the latter asking him to come down to see us, but he replied\r\nthat he was too busy, and recommended us to wait until Saigô came back.\r\nWe visited the site of the intended foreign settlement, where we found\r\nbonded warehouses, a custom-house, a guardhouse and a palisade being\r\nerected, the object of the latter being to cut off the foreign residents\r\nfrom the city. This proceeding was altogether contrary to treaty\r\nstipulations, and we lost no time in lodging a protest with the\r\ngovernors.\r\n\r\nOn December 7 we called on two of the Council of State and their\r\ncolleagues of the second council (Inaba Hiôbu Taiyu, Matsudaira Nui no\r\nKami, Nagai Hizen no Kami and Kawakatsu Bingo no Kami), who were on\r\ntheir way to Yedo, and had orders from the Tycoon to stop at Ozaka to\r\nsee us. They gave us no information worth mentioning, but asserted that\r\nhe had long ago been intending to take the step of surrendering the\r\ngovernment to the Mikado. This of course we did not believe, our view\r\nbeing that he was tired of being badgered by Satsuma, Chôshiû, Tosa and\r\nHizen, and that in order to give unity to his own party, he had resolved\r\nto call a general council, which possibly might reinstate him by a\r\nmajority of votes, and thus establish his authority more strongly than\r\never.\r\n\r\nOn December 12, having transacted all our business at Ozaka, we started\r\nin palanquins for Hiôgo. Mitford walked as far as Ama-ga-saki, which he\r\nreached in 3-3/4 hours, and I in a palanquin took half-an-hour more. By\r\nthree o'clock in the afternoon, after travelling six hours, we had got\r\nonly half-way. So we betook ourselves to Shanks' mare. Mitford's\r\nJapanese teacher Nagazawa and our escort had to trot in order to keep\r\npace with us, and we got on board the \"Rattler\" soon after six. Having\r\ndined with Captain Swann, we went ashore again, and took up our quarters\r\nfor the night at the municipal office (_sô-kwai-sho_). Next day we\r\ncalled on the newly appointed governor, Shibata Hiuga no Kami, to\r\ndiscuss various business details. He told us that there had been a week\r\nof feasting at Kôbé in honour of the anticipated opening of the port,\r\nwith processions of people dressed in red silk crape, with carts which\r\nwere supposed to be transporting earth to raise the site of the proposed\r\nforeign settlement. Its situation appeared to us entirely satisfactory.\r\nFêtes at Hiôgo itself were also projected. These we took to be marked\r\nsigns of goodwill on the part of both government and people, and to\r\npromise a great extension of friendly intercourse between Japanese and\r\nforeigners.\r\n\r\nThe same day we returned to Ozaka by boat, accompanied by Noel\r\n(afterwards Admiral Sir Gerard Noel), first lieutenant of the \"Rattler.\"\r\nThere we found the whole population occupied with festivities in honour\r\nof the approaching opening of the city to foreign trade. Crowds of\r\npeople in holiday garb, dancing and singing \"Ii ja nai ka, ii ja nai ka\"\r\n(isn't it good), houses decorated with rice-cakes in all colours,\r\noranges, little bags, straw and flowers. The dresses worn were chiefly\r\nred crape, a few blue and purple. Many of the dancers carried red\r\nlanterns on their heads. The pretext for these rejoicings was a shower\r\nof pieces of paper, bearing the names of the two gods of Isé, alleged to\r\nhave taken place recently.\r\n\r\nOn the 14th we received a visit from our Satsuma friend Yoshii. He told\r\nus that the coalition, which was determined to push matters to the last\r\nextremity in order to gain their points, consisted of Satsuma, Tosa,\r\nUwajima, Chôshiû and Geishiû. Higo and Arima were inclined to join,\r\nHizen and Chikuzen indifferent. On the whole, it might safely be said\r\nthat all the western clans were pretty much of one mind. Osumi no Kami\r\n(who suffered a good deal from _kakké_, a sort of dropsy of the legs)\r\nwas too ill to come to Kiôto, and Shiuri no Taiyu was to take his place,\r\narriving in a few days. Saedani Umétarô, a Tosa man whose acquaintance I\r\nhad made at Nagasaki, had been murdered a few days ago at his lodgings\r\nin Kiôto by three men unknown. The Tycoon had about 10,000 troops at\r\nKiôto, Satsuma and Tosa about half that number between them, part in\r\nKiôto, part in Ozaka. Other _daimiôs_, such as Geishiû, would also bring\r\nup troops. The Chôshiû question would be difficult to settle peacefully,\r\nas the Tycoon's party included a large number of men who wished to force\r\non a renewal of the war in order to effect the complete destruction of\r\nthat clan.\r\n\r\nI took occasion to say that the murder of our sailors at Nagasaki was by\r\nno means disposed of, and that one of the first demands to be laid by us\r\nbefore the new government would be for the punishment of the murderers;\r\nthat no money compensation would be accepted, and that the Japanese, if\r\nthey wished to remain on good terms with foreigners and to avoid a\r\ndisaster, had better prevent the occurrence of such incidents. Yoshii\r\nreplied that if internal affairs were not placed on a sound footing on\r\nthe present occasion, the _daimiôs_ would wreak their wrath upon\r\nforeigners, in order to provoke bad relations between the Tycoon and the\r\ntreaty powers. I responded that they would not gain their object, as we\r\ncould no longer hold the Tycoon responsible for the acts of persons over\r\nwhom he had no real control.\r\n\r\nOn the 16th I received a visit from two Uwajima men, Sutô Tajima and\r\nSaionji Yukiyé, the former a man of high rank in his clan, the other an\r\nofficial whom I had met when I was at Uwajima in the spring of the year.\r\nThey had come up to Ozaka as precursors of Daté Iyo no Kami, who was\r\nexpected to arrive early in January. They represented him as greatly\r\npleased with the existing prospect of the establishment of a parliament,\r\nregarding which the old prince had talked to me on more than one\r\noccasion. I mentioned the Nagasaki affair in similar terms to those I\r\nhad used to Yoshii, and assured them that the question of reparation was\r\nby no means abandoned, but was simply in abeyance for the present, and I\r\nexplained that we were on as good terms with Tosa as before.\r\n\r\nNo sooner had they gone than Nakai came in to say that Gotô had arrived\r\nthe previous evening, but was too busy to call on us. We offered to call\r\non him instead of his coming to us, a proposal which was joyfully\r\naccepted, and meeting Gotô in front of the Tosa _yashiki_ (agency), we\r\nturned in there with him. Our first topic was the murder of our two\r\nsailors. We said that though the particular suspicion against Tosa was\r\nremoved by the discovery that there was no foundation for the report of\r\nthe \"Yokobuyé\" and \"Nankai\" leaving the port together on the night of\r\nthe murder, the fact that our men had been killed by Japanese still\r\nremained, and that we should not rest until redress was afforded, not in\r\nthe shape of a pecuniary indemnity, which some people appeared to\r\nsuppose would satisfy the British Government, but by the punishment of\r\nthe criminals, and that we were content to wait until the establishment\r\nof the new constitution gave us an opportunity for presenting our demand\r\nwith effect. He replied that the recent murder of two of his own\r\nsubordinates inspired him with sympathy for our feelings, and that both\r\nthe ex-Prince Yôdô and he himself held that no stone should be left\r\nunturned to discover the criminals. I then asked him to take charge of a\r\ngun which I wished to present to Yôdô as a small return, though not of\r\nany great value or beauty, for his kindness to me. We then discussed the\r\nconstitution which he proposed for the new government, and particularly\r\nthe senate he desired to see established. The upshot of the conversation\r\nwas that he promised to come down from Kiôto to see the chief on his\r\narrival, and to stay a few days at Ozaka in order to learn more from\r\nMitford and myself about the English form of government. All we could do\r\non that occasion was to give him some information about the composition\r\nof the Cabinet, and the method of carrying legislation through\r\nParliament.\r\n\r\nGotô said he wanted to employ a foreigner, such as myself for instance,\r\nto collect information for him, and with whom he could consult. I\r\nreplied that I was content to serve my own government, and could not\r\ntake service under that of any other state, but that if the clan wanted\r\nthe services of an officer they should apply to the minister for the\r\nloan of one.\r\n\r\nThe idea of taking _pay_ from a Japanese, however highly placed, did not\r\nsuit me, and I was resolved, in case I quitted Her Majesty's service,\r\nnot to seek another career in Japan.\r\n\r\nThat evening we, that is, Mitford, Noel and I, devoted to a _dîner en\r\nville_ in the Japanese fashion at a sort of \"Trois frères\" called\r\nTokaku, and about half-past six we started forth. It was expected that\r\nthe streets would be full of merry-makers, and the two men of my escort\r\nwho were detailed to accompany us wished that the rest of them should be\r\nsummoned to attend us. But I threw the burden of decision on their\r\nshoulders by saying that I thought the two of them would be enough for\r\nanything, and no more was heard of that proposition. So we issued into\r\nthe streets, and dived through all sorts of back lanes to find a shorter\r\ncut, for my instinct seemed to show the road, but our escort triumphed\r\nafter all, and they brought us to the place of entertainment by what\r\nproved to be a circuitous route.\r\n\r\nSome difficulty was experienced in making our way through the crowds of\r\npeople in flaming red garments dancing and shouting the refrain _ii ja\r\nnai ka_. They were so much taken up with their dancing and\r\nlantern-carrying that we passed along almost unnoticed, but I was half\r\nafraid the escort (_betté_) would provoke a quarrel by the violent\r\nmanner in which they thrust people aside in order to make way for us; on\r\nthe contrary, the crowd did not offer any rudeness to us, and let us\r\npass without hindrance. On reaching Tokaku we found the principal rooms\r\noccupied by festival makers and the rest of the house shut up. Our\r\nmessenger had been just that instant turned away with a refusal to\r\nreceive us. While we stood there trying to persuade the people of the\r\nhouse to give us a room, a herd of young men and boys trooped in,\r\nshouting and dancing, and tossing about in their midst a palanquin\r\noccupied by a fat doll clad in the most gorgeous robes. All the feasters\r\nin the house came out to meet them, one cannot say at the doors, for in\r\nJapan there are no doors, but on the thresholds in which the sliding\r\nscreens run that divide the different parts of a house. After a violent\r\nunited dance executed by all present, the troop disappeared again. The\r\nnumber of pretty girls who appeared as dancers was much larger than\r\nprevious experience had led us to suppose Ozaka could possibly contain.\r\nWe could not prevail on the Tokaku people to take us in, but they gave\r\nus a guide to a house about \"five minutes\" walk distant. There we found\r\nthe doors locked, the explanation being that all the inmates had gone to\r\nthe dance. We began to despair of success, and contemplate the\r\npossibility of having to return to our quarters and sup on whatever cold\r\nfood \"the philosopher\" (Mitford's Chinese servant Lin-fu) could give us.\r\nLuckily however the guide, a little man on sturdy legs, said he knew of\r\na house called Shô-ô-tei (Hall of the Old Man of the Pine Tree), where\r\nwe might as well call, since it lay on our road home. So we went there,\r\nand after waiting a few minutes were shown into a very good room, where\r\nwe had our meal, waited on by the women of the house, who carried on the\r\nconversation and passed the wine cup, offices usually discharged on such\r\noccasions by _geishas_. The entire absence of fear or dislike on the\r\npart of the Ozaka women was very remarkable when compared with the cold\r\nand often hostile reception we were accustomed to meet with in Yedo.\r\nCuriosity apparently triumphed over every other feeling; and besides,\r\nthe attendants mostly had their teeth dyed black, a sign of mature age,\r\ninstead of wearing them as they are naturally, and probably felt immune\r\nfrom attempts at flirtation. We got home early, very pleased with our\r\nadventure.\r\n\r\nNoel returned next day to his ship, and we moved over from our lodgings\r\nin Tera-machi to the quarters prepared for the whole legation behind the\r\ncastle. The main building was large enough to accommodate the minister\r\nand three or four members of what he delighted to call \"the staff,\" a\r\nmilitary term picked up during his campaigns in China. The outbuildings\r\nwere given up to Mitford, the officers of the detachment from the 2/ix\r\nregiment shared a second, guests were to be put up in a third, the\r\nmounted escort in a fourth, and the fifth I reserved for myself; a\r\ntemporary shed was provided for the infantry guard.\r\n\r\nAfter settling in, we went to call on Saigô, with whom we found Iwashita\r\nSajiémon, just back from Europe, accompanied by his friend the Comte de\r\nMontblanc. The conversation turned on the murder of the two bluejackets\r\nof H.M.S. \"Icarus.\" Saigô paid me the compliment of saying that I gave\r\nlittle hits, but hard ones. Opinion seemed to be divided as to the\r\nprobability of more such murders being committed. I used to find that\r\nmen who desired the progress of Japan, and were actuated by friendly\r\nfeeling towards its people, maintained that the attacks on foreigners\r\nwould cease, but that unprejudiced observers did not give one much\r\nencouragement to leave off the practice of carrying revolvers. We gave\r\nthem clearly to understand that the \"Icarus\" affair could not be\r\ndisposed of by the payment of a sum of money by way of \"indemnity.\" They\r\nwere anxious to disprove the possibility of there having been a plot on\r\nthe part of Tosa and Satsuma men to murder Mitford and myself when we\r\npassed through Fushimi in the previous August. (Fortunately we changed\r\nour route for other reasons.) But I had no doubt myself of the fact.\r\nNoguchi had told me when we reached Ozaka that he had overheard some\r\nmen, whom he believed to be Tosa _samurai_, expressing their regret at\r\nhaving failed to carry out their project, and when I told Gotô at Susaki\r\nthat I had heard this story, he replied that being in Kiôto at the time\r\nhe too had heard such a report, and took measures to prevent the scheme,\r\nif there were one, from being carried out. Saigô tried to show that it\r\ncould not have been true, and asserted that Gotô was not then in Kiôto.\r\nWe assured him that we did not think it probable that men of either\r\nSatsuma or Tosa would desire to take the lives of foreigners, but that\r\nthe clans contained ruffians who sometimes took such ideas into their\r\nheads quite independently of their chiefs.\r\n\r\nIshikawa Kawachi no Kami, a commissioner of foreign affairs, came to see\r\nus on the 18th. He told us that no date had been fixed for the\r\nassembling of the _daimiôs_, and no one of them could be blamed if he\r\narrived at Kiôto later than the others. Even supposing that the few who\r\nwere already there, or were about to arrive, should discuss matters and\r\ncome to a decision, how could they enforce it? Objections would surely\r\nbe raised. We came to the conclusion from this conversation that civil\r\nwar was after all not unlikely to break out, and that the omission to\r\nfix a date for the assembly was part of the Tycoon's plan for\r\nembarrassing his opponents.\r\n\r\nLetters which arrived overland from Yedo on the 20th reported the\r\ngeneral impression to be that there was no more a Tycoon, and that Keiki\r\nwas nobody. So much did distance and report by word of mouth change the\r\nlook of the situation. Itô Shunsuké's opinion was that war would begin\r\nalmost immediately, with the object of depriving the Tycoon of a part of\r\nhis domains, which were far too large for the peace of the country. He\r\nhad only seven battalions of infantry in Kiôto, all reinforcements\r\nhaving been countermanded in the belief that no cause for war existed.\r\nOf course Hiôgo and Ozaka would not be the most peaceful places of\r\nresidence for foreigners if war did break out, and our Legation,\r\nsituated just at the back of the Ozaka castle, would be endangered, as\r\nthat fortress was certain to be the centre of a severe conflict in arms.\r\nHe wanted to know whether Sir Harry's arrival and the opening of Hiôgo\r\nand Ozaka to foreign trade could not be deferred, and whether Saigô had\r\nwritten to the chief to make this proposal. I said \"No, of course\"\r\n(though I did not know). Then, said he, their object must be to open\r\nthese two places, and so content foreigners, while the Japanese went on\r\nwith their plans for the reformation of the government. Some one however\r\nmust be appointed to represent Japan at Ozaka and Hiôgo. I suggested the\r\npresent governors, but he replied that they would immediately be\r\nexpelled when the crisis arrived. I rejoined that as long as the\r\ninsurgent forces did not attack the residences of foreigners, they might\r\ndo as they liked with the Tycoon, but that if they interfered with us\r\nthey would have a couple of English regiments and all the foreign\r\nmen-of-war to fight against, as well as the Tokugawa troops. Itô did not\r\nthink they would wish to do this, and promised to let me know beforehand\r\nwhen the actual day for taking action became imminent. A body of Chôshiû\r\nmen was coming up under the command of Môri Heirokurô and Fukumoto\r\nShima, Katsura (_i.e._ Kido) and Kikkawa Kemmotsu being obliged to\r\nremain at home to carry on the administration of the province.\r\n\r\nSir Harry arrived on December 24, took a look at the legation quarters,\r\nand then went back to the ship that had brought him down. There was a\r\nfine confusion all day. I received a letter from Shinosaki Yatarô\r\ncomparing the present condition of the country to an eggshell held in\r\nthe hand, and begging me to persuade Komatsu and Saigô to keep the\r\npeace. On Christmas Day Kasuya Chikugo no Kami, a commissioner of\r\nforeign affairs, called. He said that the _daimiôs_ of Hikoné, Bizen and\r\nGeishiû, all three men of importance, were in Kiôto, and he appeared to\r\nbe doubtful what was going to happen. My old friend Hayashi Kenzô, who\r\nhad made the cruise in H.M.S. \"Argus\" with me in January, called on the\r\n28th, and reported that 1500 Chôshiû men had disembarked at Nishinomiya\r\non the 23rd, under the command of Môri Takumi. He also seemed uncertain\r\nwhether there would be any fighting, but he thought that Saigô and Gotô\r\nwere trying to keep the peace. My protégé Endo naturally went off to\r\nNishinomiya to see his clansmen, and doubtless to report what he had\r\nlearned in Yedo to Môri Takumi. The latter had the reputation of being a\r\nman of capacity, which was perhaps the reason why he had retired into a\r\nprivate position (_in-kio_) early in life. On the 29th Iga no Kami came\r\nto see the chief, accompanied by Nagai Gemba no Kami, who had the credit\r\nof being almost the only adviser of the Tycoon at the moment, though of\r\ncourse Iga no Kami was admitted into their secrets. All the governors of\r\nOzaka and Hiôgo were present, and the only subjects of discussion\r\nrelated to the arrangement for opening these places to trade on January\r\n1. \"All the governors\" is the phrase, because the practice in those days\r\nwas to duplicate nearly every administrative office.\r\n\r\nNext day the two great men came again, and the Nagasaki murders were the\r\ntopic of conversation. It appeared unlikely that we should obtain any\r\nsatisfaction. It was however agreed that old Hirayama should again go to\r\nNagasaki, in spite of Gemba's efforts to get him let off this\r\ndisagreeable errand. The Foreign Office had written approving Sir\r\nHarry's action, and he seemed inclined to keep this question hanging\r\nover the Tycoon's government as a perpetual nightmare. He told them in\r\nthe strongest language that we would never desist from pressing the\r\nmatter until the murderers were seized and punished. Our callers asked a\r\ngreat number of questions about the English constitution, just as Gotô\r\nhad done, so that it appeared as if both parties were desirous of\r\ngetting our advice. Then Sir Harry told them that unless they got all\r\ntroops away from Ozaka, where they might come into collision with\r\nforeigners, he would send for a couple of regiments. I could not help\r\nfeeling that it was unfair of him to meddle in this way in Japanese\r\ndomestic affairs and thus add to the Tycoon's embarrassments, for as the\r\n_daimiôs_' forces had taken Ozaka merely as a stage towards advancing on\r\nKiôto, where else could they go except to the capital? Following on this\r\nmove, he sent me the following day to Koba Dennai, the Satsuma agent, to\r\nexplain why he wished their troops to be removed. Koba replied that\r\nthere were only two hundred and fifty, but doubtless they could be sent\r\nelsewhere, and he would write to Saigô on this point. From there I went\r\non to see a Chôshiû man named Nagamatsu Bunsuké, who had come over from\r\nNishinomiya, and was stopping with the Geishiû people. A proclamation\r\nwas out announcing that the Chôshiû forces, having been ordered to come\r\nup to the neighbourhood of the capital, were allowed to borrow the use\r\nof the Geishiû _yashiki_, and to be quartered also at the Nishi\r\nHongwanji temple. Nevertheless, they had no wish to come to Ozaka, and\r\nthought it a great piece of luck that the English Minister had proposed\r\nto the Tycoon's people what they themselves happened to desire most\r\nparticularly. I found it impossible to get any explanation from\r\nNagamatsu of the real reason for their coming.\r\n\r\nIga no Kami had told us that by a messenger who left Geishiû on the\r\n15th, instructions were sent ordering them not to come, but he went by\r\nsea, thus missing a Chôshiû messenger who arrived there by land to\r\nreport that they were starting in compliance with the orders previously\r\ngiven. (This was evidently a mere fiction.) He also said that on the\r\n20th three Chôshiû steamers full of troops put in at Mitarai in Geishiû,\r\nand asked for Geishiû officers to accompany them. This request was\r\nrefused, and they were advised to return home, which they declined to\r\ndo, alleging their prince's orders; without a recall from him they\r\nwere unable to go back to Chôshiû. This was the Geishiû story, which\r\nit was impossible to believe. I felt certain that it had been\r\nconcocted between the two clans, and was simply in accordance with the\r\ngeneral plan of campaign. That the Tycoon should have sent orders to\r\ncountermand the movements of Chôshiû troops was pretty clear proof\r\nthat when the original instructions were given (if they really were\r\ngiven), the present change of policy on the part of the government was\r\nnot contemplated--as Iki no Kami had pretended to us--but in reality had\r\nrecently been forced on them by the confederate daimiôs. It had been\r\nintended by the chief that I should go down to Nishinomiya to ascertain\r\nhow the land lay, but having learnt all that the Chôshiû man was willing\r\nto tell me, I was relieved from the necessity of undertaking a toilsome\r\njourney.\r\n\r\nThat day, the last of the year 1867, despatches arrived from the Foreign\r\nOffice sanctioning my appointment as Japanese Secretary, with a salary\r\nof £700 a year, in succession to Eusden, transferred to Hakodaté as\r\nconsul.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XXIV\r\n\r\n                      OUTBREAK OF CIVIL WAR (1868)\r\n\r\n\r\nON New Year's Day salutes were fired at Tempôzan, the fort at the mouth\r\nof the Ozaka river, and at Hiôgo, in honour of the opening of the city\r\nand the port to foreign trade. Many Japanese had been under the\r\nimpression that it had been deferred, owing to the notification about\r\nthe west coast port, _i.e._ Niigata, which they took to mean Hiôgo\r\nbecause of its situation west of Kiôto. I conceived a plan for taking\r\nthe chief up to Kiôto to mediate between the contending parties, and to\r\nprevent the Japanese from cutting each other's throats, and I proposed\r\nto go ahead of him to Fushimi in order to make the necessary\r\narrangements with Saigô and Gotô. But this ambitious scheme was\r\nfrustrated by the rapidity with which events developed at Kiôto.\r\n\r\nRumour was very busy during the next few days. First, we heard that the\r\ntwo princes of Chôshiû had been reinstated in their titles. The Tosa\r\n_in-kio_ (Yôdô) landed on the afternoon of January 1, and went up to\r\nKiôto at once without stopping at Ozaka. It was said that the Tycoon's\r\nposition was weak, for he had no support except from Aidzu and one or\r\ntwo of the smaller clans. Chôshiû's people had taken military possession\r\nof Nishinomiya, and were patrolling the surrounding country, as if\r\nafraid of being attacked. My man Noguchi told us that the Chôshiû troops\r\nhad left Nishinomiya, and marched ten miles to Koya on the road to\r\nKiôto. All the Aidzu men at Ozaka had gone up to Kiôto. The prince was\r\ndissatisfied with the Tycoon's leniency in the Chôshiû business, and\r\nintended to resign his office of guardian of the Mikado's person\r\n(_Shugo-shoku_). On the 4th January there were symptoms of a great\r\ndisturbance at Kiôto. The ministers of the other Treaty Powers came to\r\nvisit the chief and impart their views of what had passed. For the most\r\npart these were of very slight value, for they were very much in the\r\ndark as to the internal condition of Japan. Von Brandt, the Chargé\r\nd'Affaires of the North German Confederation, was so little acquainted\r\nwith the geography of the country as to confound Geishiû and Kishiû.\r\nEndo, who had come back from Nishinomiya, told me that Môri Takumi was\r\nalready at Kiôto with part of the Chôshiû force, and that another part\r\nhad occupied Fushimi in conjunction with Satsuma troops. But more\r\nsignificant than anything else was the fact that Satsuma, Geishiû and\r\nTosa were guarding the imperial palace in the place of Aidzu. There was\r\nsome talk of the Tycoon intending to come down to Ozaka, and boats were\r\nsaid to have been embargoed at Yodo to convey his drilled soldiers down\r\nthe river. That the object of the _daimiôs_ was not to fight the Tycoon,\r\nbut only to extort concessions from him. They proposed to deprive him of\r\na million _koku_ of lands as a punishment for the transgressions of the\r\nTokugawa family. It was certain, Endo said, that the Chôshiû question\r\nwas settled, and that the guards of the palace had been changed.\r\nNoguchi's story was that Aidzu, disgusted with the Tycoon, sent in his\r\nwritten resignation, but that it was intercepted by Kuwana. The Tycoon\r\nhowever had heard of Aidzu's intention, of which he informed Iga no Kami\r\ndirectly after the return of the latter from Ozaka, and sent him his\r\ndismissal. Then the three clans above-mentioned seized the environs of\r\nthe palace. The _daimiôs_ thereupon proceeded to the palace to discuss\r\nthe situation, but the Tycoon refused to attend. He would neither fight\r\nnor take any decided action; his sole aim was to arrange matters\r\npeaceably. Noguchi evidently was reflecting the war-like disposition of\r\nhis clan. Ishikawa Kawachi no Kami gave a somewhat different account,\r\nbut it was clear that up to that moment there had been no disturbance of\r\nthe peace. The _Kwambaku_ Nijô, a nephew of the Tycoon Iyénari, who died\r\nin 1841 aged 52, was said to have been dismissed, and either Konoyé or\r\nKujô appointed in his place. Chôshiû's troops had entered Kiôto on\r\nJanuary 2.\r\n\r\nOzaka was not perturbed by the events that had passed at the capital,\r\nand on the 5th I was able to give an entertainment to my Japanese escort\r\nat a restaurant in the city. We had two charming _geishas_ to attend on\r\nthe party, one looking as if she had just stepped out of a picture, the\r\nclassical contour of the face, arched nose, small full underlip, narrow\r\neyes, and a good-hearted expression of countenance. The other personally\r\nmore attractive according to western notions of beauty, but with a\r\nlittle of the devil in her eyes. Lastly, there was an old _geiko_ or\r\nmusician of six or eight and twenty, a clever woman. The streets were\r\nstill illuminated at night for the festival, and crowded with dancers.\r\n\r\nOn the 6th the mystery was cleared up by Ishikawa, who came to tell me\r\nthat on the 3rd Satsuma had proposed to abolish not only the Tycoon, but\r\nalso the _Kwambaku_, _Tensô_ and _Gisô_, the three offices intermediary\r\nbetween the Mikado and the Tycoon. The new administration would consist\r\nof _Sôsai_, which sounded like secretaries of state; _Gijô_, which he\r\nthought meant a cabinet; and thirdly _Sanyo_, resembling our\r\nunder-secretaries of state. This looked rather like what we had\r\nsuggested to Gotô as the framework of the future executive.[5] He said\r\nthat this proposal had met with great opposition from others besides the\r\n_fudai daimiôs_, who were afraid that the extremists might go further\r\nand abolish the Mikado. I endeavoured to reassure him on this point. \"It\r\nis not,\" he continued, \"a proposal which can be discussed over the\r\ntable, and fighting must decide.\" It seemed from his account that the\r\nTycoon personally did not object, but his followers objected for him,\r\nwhile he seemed willing to make every possible sacrifice in order to\r\nsecure peace.\r\n\r\n    [5] But it was not quite correct. The Sôsai were to be a\r\n        sort of partners in the office of Minister-President, as\r\n        we should call it, and Gijô were to be the heads of\r\n        administrative departments.\r\n\r\nFrom a letter of January 4 to my mother, I find that on the 1st Locock,\r\nMitford and Willis, the legation doctor, and I were to have gone over to\r\nHiôgo to dine with the Admiral, whose steam-launch was to come to Ozaka\r\nto fetch us. So we went down to the foreign settlement, and, having no\r\nother resource, got into a large Japanese boat managed by a single\r\nlittle boy with a paddle. At first we proceeded very slowly, but a\r\nsailing boat gave us a tow, after which we shoved off and had to depend\r\nagain on the small boy. It was bitterly cold, with a north-east wind. I\r\nsat in the bows, holding up a railway rug with my teeth. Two of the\r\nothers protected themselves with umbrellas, and Mitford's Chinese\r\nservant, the faithful Lin-fu, hoisted a mat on a pole. So we sailed down\r\nthe river to the port at its mouth. No signs were to be seen of the\r\nlaunch, so we tried to hire a Japanese boat to carry us across the bay,\r\nthe distance being only eleven miles and the wind fair, but one and all\r\nrefused, on account of the gale they would have to encounter in coming\r\nback. So we were compelled to put our luggage into a boat and return.\r\nThe distance from the fort to the Legation was about seven miles and a\r\nhalf, but it took us several hours, as we had to call in at the newly\r\nestablished vice-consulate in the foreign settlement. We dined all\r\ntogether at the Legation, the chief being confined to his room with a\r\nsharp attack of lumbago, which had not, however, prevented his making a\r\nformal entry into Ozaka on horseback, accompanied by the mounted escort\r\nand the guard of fifty infantry detached from one of the regiments\r\nstationed at Yokohama.\r\n\r\nBy January 7 all was over with the Tycoon. That morning Moriyama, the\r\nancient Dutch linguist who used to interpret between the foreign\r\nministers and the Rôjiû, came to communicate the news of Keiki's\r\nwithdrawal from Kiôto. At first I feigned to suppose that he was coming\r\ndown to see the French Minister. \"Not at all, he is coming here,\r\ndeprived of the office of _Shôgun_.\" He had already made up his mind to\r\ndo this four or five days before, but was persuaded to countermand the\r\norders given for his departure, whereat the commissioners for foreign\r\naffairs stationed at Ozaka had rejoiced greatly. But now the orders had\r\nbeen repeated, and would be carried out. We sauntered out to look at the\r\npreparations made for his arrival. Small bodies of drilled troops were\r\nmarching about headed by drummers, and field-pieces were placed so as to\r\nsweep the narrow streets. We saw men in all sorts of military costumes\r\nwith their heads muffled up to protect them from the cold, not\r\npresenting a very martial appearance. We went on to the restaurant on\r\nthe river bank, where in the spring we had been often entertained _à la\r\nJaponaise_, and found it full of Aidzu men, whose arms were piled\r\noutside. There was a _karô_ inside, on whom I paid a call. He ascribed\r\nthe Tycoon's withdrawal to his unwillingness to fight under the walls of\r\nthe palace, and described the leading _daimiôs_ as being at loggerheads,\r\nSatsuma desiring to carry out their plans by main force, and Tosa\r\npreferring to rely on reason; but their objects were identical. It was\r\nnot Kaga, but Tosa, that was endeavouring to negotiate an arrangement\r\nbetween Satsuma and the Tycoon. He talked a good deal about forms of\r\ngovernment, and thought that Gotô's plans would be delightful, if\r\nfeasible, but the nation was not yet ripe for fundamental changes. I\r\nagreed with him that representative government would be a curious\r\nsubstitute for the despotic form of authority that had existed hitherto.\r\nMitford and I went out again about two o'clock to have another look at\r\nthe preparations, and wandered over the Kiô-bashi bridge on to the Kiôto\r\nroad. Here it was evident that the Tycoon was expected to arrive at any\r\nmoment. There were wonderful groups of men in armour, wearing surcoats\r\nof various gay colours, armed with spears and helmets. Here we found\r\nKubota Sentarô, the commander of the Tycoon's drilled troops, with a\r\ncouple of colleagues, one of whom told Mitford in bad Japanese that they\r\nwere very brave and intended to die. I whispered to Kubota that a brave\r\nman did not retreat in this fashion. He repeated the explanation of the\r\nTycoon's objection to fighting at the steps of the throne, and perhaps\r\nendangering the person of the Mikado. I replied that he should not have\r\ngiven up the guard of the palace. Kubota alleged the Mikado's orders. I\r\nsuggested that if the Mikado ordered that there should be no fighting,\r\nthat order must be obeyed. The significant rejoinder was: \"Yes, by the\r\nTycoon, but not by his retainers.\"\r\n\r\nWe had just got to the end of the street that ran by the castle moat\r\nwhen the bugles sounded to arms, and we saw a long train of drilled\r\ntroops advancing. We stood on one side opposite to a man wearing a\r\ngorgeous red surcoat, till the troops should pass. On they went,\r\nfollowed by a herd of men in fantastic costumes (_yû-géki-tai_, \"brave\r\nfighting men\"), some wearing helmets with long wigs of black or white\r\nhair reaching half-way down their backs, others in ordinary helmets,\r\nbasin-shaped war-hats (_jin-gasa_), flat hats, armed, some with long\r\nspears, short spears, Spencer rifles, Swiss rifles, muskets, or the\r\nplain two swords. Then a silence came over the scene. Every Japanese\r\nknelt down as a group of horsemen approached. It was Keiki and his\r\ntrain. We took off our hats to fallen greatness. He was muffled in a\r\nblack hood, and wore an ordinary war-hat. What could be seen of his\r\ncountenance looked worn and sad. He did not seem to notice us. Iga no\r\nKami and Buzen no Kami, members of his council, who came next, on the\r\ncontrary nodded gaily to our salute. Aidzu and Kuwana were also there.\r\nThen followed other _yû-géki-tai_, and the procession closed with more\r\ndrilled troops. We turned round with the last of these, and hurried on\r\nto see the entrance into the castle. On the way we met the chief, who\r\nhad come out to have a look at the Tycoon, to whose downfall he had\r\ncontributed as far as lay in his power. The defiling across the bridge\r\nover the moat was an effective scheme of colour, and the procession\r\nentered by the great gate (_ôté_). Every one dismounted except the\r\nTycoon. Rain fell, in much accordance with the occasion.\r\n\r\nThe chief insisted, much against my own feeling, in sending to ask for\r\nan interview on the morrow. In the letter I sent, I spoke of Keiki as\r\nTycoon Denka (His Highness the Tycoon). The reply which came back styled\r\nhim simply Uyésama, the title borne by the head of the Tokugawa family\r\nbefore his formal recognition as Shôgun by the Mikado's Court.\r\n\r\nEndo came back with the following information. Arisugawa and Yamashina,\r\nboth princes of the blood, Ogimachi and Iwakura, court nobles, were\r\nappointed _Sôsai_; the princes of Owari, Echizen, Geishiû, Satsuma and\r\nTosa were appointed _gijô_. Ohara (a court noble) and various others\r\nwere to be _Sanyo_, besides three from each of the great clans. Satsuma\r\nin this way was represented by Iwashita, Okubo and Saigô. Those of the\r\nother clans were not known to him. The titles of the Prince of Chôshiû\r\nand his son had been restored to them. The palace was guarded by Satsuma\r\nand Geishiû, Chôshiû's troops held the city of Kiôto. A Satsuma steamer\r\nhad left for Chikuzen to bring back the five court nobles who had fled\r\nin 1864, Sanjô (afterwards prime minister for a series of years),\r\nSanjô-Nishi, Mibu, Shijô and Higashi-kuzé (subsequently minister for\r\nForeign Affairs).\r\n\r\nIt was difficult to accuse Keiki of cowardice. No one had ever yet\r\nexpressed such an opinion of him, and the probability was that he could\r\nnot put confidence in the courage of his troops. How a new government\r\nwhich did not include the Tokugawa chief could hope to succeed one did\r\nnot see. He must either join the _daimiôs_ or be destroyed. Perhaps the\r\nlatter alternative was what his adversaries designed. Keiki had declined\r\nto see the chief on the following day, and it looked as if the audience\r\nwould have to be deferred. The policy advocated in the _Sakuron_,\r\ntranslated from my articles in the \"Japan Times,\" seemed to govern the\r\nsituation. The opening of Yedo to foreign trade must evidently be\r\npostponed, as Locock had declined the responsibility of superintending\r\nthe execution of the arrangements.\r\n\r\nOn the morning of January 8 the chief became very impatient, and about\r\nnoon ordered me to prepare a note to the effect that Locock and I should\r\ngo to the castle and arrange for an audience. Its despatch was delayed\r\nby a private note from Koba Dennai asking me to name an hour for an\r\ninterview with him. At three o'clock our note was to have gone in, when\r\nin came Tsukahara and Ishikawa to inform us that the French Minister was\r\nto see the Tycoon, as we still called him, at once, and that Keiki could\r\nreceive Sir Harry to-morrow at any hour he chose to name. On hearing\r\nthat he had been outstripped by his colleague, his wrath was unbounded;\r\nhe claimed priority on the ground of superior diplomatic rank, and\r\nordered out the escort. We proceeded to the castle in pouring rain. I\r\nwas a little behind the others, and entered the audience chamber just as\r\nRoches and Sir Harry were exchanging words about what the former\r\nstigmatized as a breach of _les convénances_ in interrupting his\r\ninterview. But he got as good as he gave, and the audience then\r\nproceeded, after Aidzu and Kuwana had been presented and ordered to\r\nretire. Aidzu was a dark-complexioned man with a hooked nose, about\r\nthirty-two years old, of middle stature and thin; Kuwana an ugly young\r\nperson, apparently twenty-four years of age, pock-marked and of dwarfish\r\nproportions. The old fox Hirayama sat behind the Uyésama and took notes.\r\n Shiwoda Samurô, who spoke French well, interpreted for Roches and I for\r\nSir Harry simultaneously the words which fell from Keiki's lips. He gave\r\nbut a lame account of the events of the last few days, professing at one\r\nmoment to have withdrawn his troops from the palace in accordance with\r\nan imperial order, while refusing to recognize another such order, which\r\nhe felt was equally dictated by Satsuma. Perhaps this was natural on his\r\npart, for it abolished his office and forbade him access to the palace.\r\nHe had had it hinted to him that he should also resign his rank of\r\nNaidaijin, and offer to surrender two million _koku_ of lands; but he\r\nhad resolved not to heed the suggestion, on the ground that this\r\nproperty belonged to him apart from his office, just as much as the\r\nlands of Chôshiû, Satsuma and the other _daimiôs_ belonged to them. He\r\nappeared to feel that the _daimiôs_ had stolen a march on him by\r\npreparing their plans beforehand, instead of proceeding with the general\r\ncongress of princes at which each should be free to speak his own mind;\r\nin other words, he was vexed at having been taken in by a stratagem.\r\nThat the proposal of a congress was merely intended to throw dust in his\r\neyes was pretty evident. He explained the order for the withdrawal of\r\nthe Aidzu palace guard by saying that other _daimiôs_, amongst them\r\nSatsuma and Geishiû, held some of the gates under Aidzu, and that they\r\nintroduced certain proscribed court nobles into the precincts after the\r\n_Kwambaku_ and other dignitaries had retired for the day on the morning\r\nof January 3rd., and that at noon the same day these persons issued the\r\nproclamation setting up the new government. This he said was a\r\npreconcocted matter; they had it all ready on paper, and took these\r\nmeasures without consulting anyone. At one time he seemed to say that\r\nthe five great _daimiôs_ were divided among themselves, at another he\r\nspoke of the decrees as having been agreed to by them all beforehand.\r\nAfter finishing his account, he asked the opinion of the two ministers.\r\nBoth expressed admiration of his patriotism in surrendering power, and\r\nthe justice of his desire to settle all questions by a general congress,\r\nRoches in very flattering terms, Sir Harry more moderately, asking also\r\nsome pertinent questions, which were answered without much frankness.\r\nKeiki gave as his reason for coming down to Ozaka his fear lest a tumult\r\nshould arise in the vicinity of the palace, and his desire to appease\r\nthe indignation of his followers. It was his intention to remain at\r\nOzaka, but could not say whether the opposite party would attack him\r\nthere. To another question as to the form of government that had been\r\nset up at Kiôto, he replied that the Mikado ruled nominally, but that\r\nKiôto was occupied by a set of men who did nothing but quarrel among\r\nthemselves, anything but govern. Yet he did not appear to claim that he\r\nhimself possessed any authority, and he did not know whether the other\r\n_daimiôs_ would rally to his support. Some of those who were at Kiôto\r\nhad been disgusted at the congress not having come into existence, and\r\nhad returned to their homes; others who were confounded by the audacity\r\nof the five still remained there. Our inference, of course, was that\r\nthey were not of his party.\r\n\r\nThe Uyésama finally said he was tired, and so put an end to the\r\nconversation. One could not but pity him, so changed as he was from the\r\nproud, handsome man of last May. Now he looked thin and worn, and his\r\nvoice had a sad tone. He said he would see the ministers again in order\r\nto consult with them. The commissioners for Foreign Affairs gave us a\r\npaper announcing Keiki's resignation of the office of Shôgun, and the\r\nchange of his title back to Uyésama.\r\n\r\nIt turned out that what Koba wanted was to ask whether I could tell him\r\nwhat the Uyésama's plans were; was he returning to Yedo in order to\r\ngather his forces together, or remaining at Ozaka with the intention of\r\nundertaking a \"ruffianly\" expedition to the capital. I sent back a reply\r\nby Itô that I knew nothing of Keiki's intended movements. To suppose\r\nthat I would supply information on such points showed great simplicity.\r\n\r\nThe diplomatic body being intent on the observation of neutrality\r\nbetween the contending parties, held a meeting on the morning of January\r\n9 at the Prussian Legation to frame a declaration, and a request to be\r\ninformed where the government was being carried on. The French Minister\r\ndid his best to make the former a declaration of non-partizanship with\r\nthe _daimiôs_. Shiwoda his interpreter and I had to translate it into\r\nJapanese, which we did separately. His version was very literal, and he\r\nrendered \"divers partis\" by a term which could only be applied to\r\nconspirators. I also wished the translation to be in free Japanese, not\r\nadhering slavishly to the wording of the original, and we had a quarrel\r\nover this point. After Shiwoda left me, Ishikawa came in, to whom I\r\nshowed my version, in order that whatever were the result, no doubt\r\nshould be possible as to the attitude of the British Legation. Up to a\r\nlate hour at night nothing was settled, except that the interview with\r\nthe Uyésama, which was to have been immediate, was put off. On the\r\nfollowing morning, after the two translations had been compared, the\r\nchief suggested an alteration in the French original which removed the\r\ncause of dispute. Then Locock and I went round to the other ministers\r\nand got them to accept my translation. While we were at the French\r\nLegation Hirayama and Kawakatsu came in, and they took the paper away\r\nwith them to prepare the Uyésama's reply. A difference had arisen\r\nbetween Roches and Sir Harry as to relative precedence. The former was\r\nonly minister plenipotentiary, while our chief was envoy extraordinary\r\nand minister plenipotentiary. According to all rules he was senior, but\r\nthe other ministers held that Roches, having arrived first in Japan, had\r\nprecedence. This decision did away with Sir Harry's claim to be _doyen_,\r\nand his reason for asserting a right to have audience before any of his\r\ncolleagues. The latter pretension was, of course, one that could in no\r\ncircumstances be upheld.\r\n\r\nAt three o'clock the whole diplomatic body assembled at the castle in\r\nthe _o-shiro-jô-in_, all the other apartments being occupied by Aidzu,\r\nKuwana and Kishiû. The same ceremony was observed as at an European\r\ncourt. Behind the Uyésama stood his pages; at his left Aidzu, Kuwana,\r\nMakino Bitchiû no Kami, Matsudaira Buzen no Kami (two councillors of\r\nstate), and a noble person whom I took to be Ogaki, then Hirayama and\r\nTsukahara. On his right were a number of _ô-metsukés_. In Japan, as in\r\nChina, the left was the position of honour. Close to His Highness stood\r\nIga no Kami, on whom devolved the task of reading the translation of the\r\nDiplomatic Body's address. The reply was a very long one, spoken by the\r\nUyésama himself. He began by explaining his policy, vindicating his\r\nretirement from Kiôto, and expressing his determination to abide by the\r\ndecisions of a general council. His reply to the particular question\r\nasked by the ministers was that foreigners should not trouble themselves\r\nabout the internal affairs of Japan, and that until the form of\r\ngovernment was settled he regarded the conduct of Foreign Affairs as his\r\nown function. The commissioners for foreign affairs, who were probably\r\napprehensive that they might to-day become nonentities, were obviously\r\nrelieved. They became joyful, and somewhat triumphant. The audience was\r\nover in an hour and a half. After the delivery of his speech the Uyésama\r\nwent round the row of foreign ministers and spoke a few words to each.\r\nTo Sir Harry he said that he hoped for a continuation of his friendship,\r\nand for his assistance in organizing the Japanese navy. The chief\r\nreplied in florid style that his heart was the same as it had ever been\r\ntowards him, and that he trusted the sun shining through the windows was\r\nan omen of his future, a metaphor which I found some difficulty in\r\nputting into Japanese. However, the Uyésama pretended to take it all in.\r\nOne of the private secretaries, Tsumagi Nakadzukasa, came in the evening\r\nto assist me in translating the answer into English.\r\n\r\nFrom Kuroda Shinyémon I received the correct text of the Kiôto decrees.\r\nHe told me that the _daimiôs_ were unanimously awaiting Keiki's reply to\r\nthe demand for two million _koku_ of lands and the surrender of a step\r\nin court rank. They expected to be joined by the other western\r\n_daimiôs_, and also by the northern ones. I advised that they should not\r\nfight if they could help it, but if they judged it necessary, to do it\r\nat once. He nodded assent. It was intended that in three or four days\r\nthe _daimiôs_ would declare their intentions to the foreign ministers.\r\nIt showed, I thought, a good deal of courage on the part of a Satsuma\r\nman to come all the way past the castle sentries to our legation, and to\r\nspare him this risky proceeding I promised to go and see him at his own\r\nquarters.\r\n\r\nIshikawa brought me a document purporting to be a protest of the\r\nretainers of Awa, Hizen, Higo, Chikuzen and other great _daimiôs_\r\nagainst the violent proceedings of the Satsuma party, and insisting on\r\nthe convocation of a general council. As far as could be inferred from\r\ntheir language, it did not appear that war was contemplated by either\r\nparty. We heard that in a day or two Owari, Echizen and the court noble\r\nIwakura would come down to receive the Tokugawa answer to the demands\r\nalready mentioned. The troops of Sakai Uta no Kami of Obama in Wakasa, a\r\npowerful adherent of the Uyésama, had been sent to Nishinomiya, where\r\nthere were probably Satsuma and Chôshiû troops. Endo however was of\r\nopinion that war would certainly break out. He said that a hundred of\r\nSatsuma's people arrived from Kiôto last night to escort thither the\r\nfive court nobles who had been recalled from exile.\r\n\r\nOn the 12th I went to see Kuroda Shinyémon and Koba Dennai, and gave\r\nthem copies of the address of the foreign diplomatic representatives to\r\nthe _ci-devant_ Tycoon as well as of his reply. They acknowledged the\r\nauthenticity of the protest of Awa and the other eleven clans, and said\r\nthat there were others who had disapproved of his restoring the\r\nsovereign power to the Mikado. From this it was evident to me that the\r\nreason why the five clans were in such a hurry to act was that they\r\nwanted to carry out their plans before the others arrived. Kaga was said\r\nto have left Kiôto in order to muster his forces for the assistance of\r\nKeiki. It now became evident that the Tokugawa party were preparing for\r\nwar. Kishiû's men were at Tennôji, Sumiyoshi, and Kidzu, close to Ozaka.\r\nAidzu had occupied the castle of Yodo, a few miles south of Kiôto on the\r\ndirect road, with 500 of his own troops, and 300 of the Shinsen-gumi, a\r\nrecently raised body of Tokugawa infantry, had also proceeded thither,\r\nwhile all along the road small detachments were stationed. Owari,\r\nEchizen and Iwakura were expected on the 18th January, but it was\r\npossible that the five clans might march on Ozaka before that date.\r\n\r\nKoba Dennai invited us to the Satsuma _yashiki_ on the 14th, so Mitford\r\nand I went there, and there we met Terashima Tôzô (formerly known as\r\nMatsugi Kôan), who had arrived from Kiôto that morning. He explained\r\nthat it was thought better to delay issuing the Mikado's announcement to\r\nforeign countries of his having assumed the government until the\r\nquestion of a surrender of territory by the late Tycoon, which Owari and\r\nEchizen had undertaken to arrange, should be settled. (It must be\r\nunderstood that in conversation with Japanese this title was never\r\nemployed, as it was only invented for foreign use. Either Tokugawa, or\r\nthe _Baku-fu_, was the term we employed.) It had been originally\r\nproposed that only Aidzu and Kuwana should come down to Ozaka, in order\r\nto return by sea to their respective countries, but as they were\r\nunwilling to come alone, Keiki was allowed to accompany them. The\r\nterritory to be surrendered by him was to form the nucleus of a national\r\ntreasury, and it had been proposed by Tosa and some other clans that\r\neach _daimiô_ should sacrifice a smaller proportion for the same\r\npurpose, but Satsuma objected to this latter part of the scheme. The\r\nMikado's notification would be in archaic Japanese,[6] stating that he\r\nwas the head of the confederated _daimiôs_, that he alone was the\r\nsovereign of Japan, that the office of Shôgun was abolished, that the\r\ngovernment was entrusted to a general council of _daimiôs_ subject to\r\nhis supervision, and lastly that the treaties were to be remodelled in\r\nhis name. We quite agreed with him that to issue the announcement in the\r\npresent undecided state of affairs would be premature. A civil governor\r\nhad been appointed for Kiôto, and a night patrol to arrest marauders and\r\ndisturbers of the public peace. Of course Keiki's plan of calling a\r\ngeneral council of _daimiôs_ to deliberate on the state of the country\r\nwas put forward because he was certain of securing a majority by the aid\r\nof those of them who were his own vassals, and that he would get a vote\r\ncarried in favour of reinstating him in his previous position of\r\nauthority. This stratagem had been defeated by the bold stroke of\r\nSatsuma getting possession of the Mikado's person.\r\n\r\n    [6] This was stated in reply to a question about the court\r\n        language. When the document eventually was delivered, it\r\n        was found, as far as my memory serves me, to be framed in\r\n        classical Chinese.\r\n\r\nNext day Sir Harry paid a visit to the castle with the object of pumping\r\nthe Uyésama about his plans for the general council and the new form of\r\ngovernment, but he was anticipated by inquiries about the British\r\nConstitution, which took up all the time available, and he was only able\r\nto get in a question or two at the end. These the Uyésama adroitly\r\nparried by saying that the events he narrated on the last occasion of\r\ntheir meeting had upset all his arrangements. The escort was ordered,\r\nand we were obliged to leave. As we were going, Aidzu came up and\r\nsaluted the chief with great cordiality, who replied that he was very\r\nfond of making the acquaintance of _daimiôs_, and already knew several.\r\nHe hoped to know more of them. Could the Prince of Aidzu tell him\r\nwhether the Prince of Awa was at Kiôto or Ozaka. Aidzu replied that he\r\ndid not know. The chief rejoined that last year he had been to Awa's\r\nplace, and had been very civilly treated. This rather broad hint,\r\nhowever, produced no effect.\r\n\r\nThe same day there came to see me a young Tosa man, of Kishiû origin,\r\nnamed Mutsu Yônosuké, with whom I discussed the question of the\r\nrecognition of the Mikado's government by the foreign ministers. I\r\nexplained that it was not for the foreign representative to take the\r\nfirst step. We had received assurances from the Tokugawa chief that he\r\nwould continue to carry on the administration, and as no communication\r\nhad yet come from the Kiôto side, we had to go on holding official\r\nrelations with him. If the Kiôto government wished to assume the\r\ndirection of affairs they should inform the _Baku-fu_ that they were\r\ngoing to notify their assumption of foreign affairs to the ministers,\r\nand then invite the latter to Kiôto. This would be to all the world a\r\nclear proof of the position held by the Mikado.\r\n\r\nMutsu replied that he had not come as a messenger from Gotô, but was\r\nmerely giving his individual views. He thought a prince of the blood\r\nshould come down to Ozaka and hold an interview at the castle with the\r\nforeign representatives, at which the Tokugawa chief should attend and\r\nresign the conduct of foreign affairs, on which the prince of the blood\r\nwould deliver the Mikado's declaration of policy. Of course he would be\r\nescorted by _daimiôs_ and their troops. I warmly approved his\r\nsuggestion, and at his request promised not to divulge it to anyone.\r\n\r\nThe next day Mitford and I went again to the Satsuma _yashiki_, and\r\nfound that a list of questions to be put to us had been sent down from\r\nKiôto. We gave one answer to everything, namely, that it was only\r\nnecessary for the Mikado to invite the ministers to Kiôto, and compel\r\nthe ex-Tycoon to abandon his claim to conduct the foreign affairs of the\r\ncountry. They proposed to make Keiki withdraw his answer of the 10th. I\r\ngave them copies of Sir Harry's Note conveying the Queen's condolences\r\non the death of the late Mikado, and of Itakura's reply; but they were\r\nnot able to say whether the Note had been communicated to the court. The\r\n_daimiô_ of Higo had arrived and proceeded to Kiôto. Bizen was to\r\ngarrison Nishinomiya. The five exiled court nobles were expected to\r\narrive that evening, and would go up to Kiôto by the river.\r\n\r\nEchizen and Owari came down from Kiôto and went to the castle, as had\r\nbeen announced several days previously. The former sent a message\r\nthrough the Japanese Foreign Department to ask when his retainers might\r\ncome to see our guard go through their drill. We replied that they did\r\nnot drill. Perhaps they had heard of the mounted escort being exhibited\r\nto the Tycoon on some previous occasion. We should have preferred to\r\nhave this request made to us direct.\r\n\r\nOn the 23rd Ishikawa came to tell us that our Japanese guard was to be\r\nincreased by one hundred men in consequence of disturbances that had\r\noccurred at Yedo. On the night of the 16th, he said, some Satsuma men\r\nhad attacked the Shiba barracks of Sakai Saemon no jô, _daimiô_ of\r\nShônai in the north, but were beaten off. On the next day but one\r\nSakai's people went together with some troops which they had borrowed\r\nfrom the government, intending to demand the surrender of the men\r\nconcerned in the violence of the 16th, but before they reached the\r\nSatsuma _yashiki_ fire was opened on them with field pieces and small\r\narms, to which they replied. In the end the _yashiki_ was burnt to the\r\nground. Some of the defenders were killed, others captured, and some\r\nescaped to a Satsuma war vessel that was lying in the bay. This at once\r\nattacked a government ship, but the result of the fight was unknown. At\r\nany rate, the other _yashikis_ of Satsuma and of Shimadzu Awaji no Kami\r\nhad also been burnt. It was possible that the Satsuma people who had\r\nescaped might try to revenge themselves by creating disturbances at\r\nOzaka. Though it was not likely that they would attack the castle, it\r\nwas thought desirable as a measure of precaution to station some troops\r\nwhere we were. The chief's answer was that they must first write all\r\nthis officially to him and await his reply before sending a single man\r\nto the Legation. To alarm us still further Ishikawa told us a story of\r\nboatmen having reported that the student interpreters we had left at\r\nYedo had been fired at from the Satsuma _yashiki_ in the street called\r\nTamachi, the date of the letter which brought this news being January\r\n14th. As this was two days before the Satsuma attack on the Sakai\r\n_yashiki_, we did not give credit to his tale. What we thought was that\r\nKeiki had returned a refusal to the ultimatum of the _daimiôs_, and\r\nfeared they would attack him at Ozaka. Echizen and Owari returned to\r\nKiôto that day, but we did not hear what had been the result of their\r\nmission. On the 24th the Admiral arrived with news from Yedo confirming\r\nall that Ishikawa had reported. His account of it was that on the night\r\nof the 17th the Satsuma people had contrived to set a part of the castle\r\non fire, and carried off Tenshô-In Sama, a princess of theirs who had\r\nmarried the last Tycoon but one. Thereupon the government people\r\nattacked all the Satsuma _yashikis_ in Yedo and burnt them, and the\r\noccupants getting on board their steamer put to sea. In the meanwhile,\r\nthe \"Eagle\" and other government vessels received orders to get up steam\r\nand attack her. A sea fight ensued, which ended by the \"Eagle\" and the\r\nSatsuma steamer disappearing in the offing. The former was met by H.M.S.\r\n\"Rodney,\" the Admiral's flagship, returning next day with her fore-yard\r\ngone, and the latter was seen off Cape Oshima, south of the province of\r\nKishiû, on the 23rd. The story that our student interpreters Quin and\r\nHodges had been fired at about the 12th as they were passing in front of\r\nthe Satsuma battery in a Japanese boat was true, but no harm was done.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XXV\r\n\r\n                      HOSTILITIES BEGUN AT FUSHIMI\r\n\r\n\r\nON the evening of the 27th a great blaze was seen in the direction of\r\nKiôto. Endo said it was at Fushimi, three miles from the capital, and\r\nthat the ex-Tycoon's troops and those of Satsuma and his allies were\r\nfighting there. The government ship \"Kaiyô-maru\" with others were\r\nblockading Satsuma vessels at Hiôgo. On the preceding day a couple of\r\nbattalions had been seen parading for the march to Kiôto, and were\r\nprobably among the troops engaged at Fushimi. Report said that Keiki\r\nhimself would take the field in a few days. Willis' servant, the\r\nfaithful Sahei, who passed through Fushimi the same day, saw bodies of\r\nSatsuma men waiting about in the streets and warming themselves at\r\nfires, but he could not say for certain whether there were any other\r\nimperialists with them. A little on the nearer side of Fushimi were the\r\n_shinsen-gumi_, and behind them large bodies of infantry, all apparently\r\neager for the fray. During the succeeding night the Satsuma _yashiki_ on\r\nthe Tosa-bori canal, where we used to meet our friends, was burnt down.\r\nSome accounts said it was set on fire by the occupants before they stole\r\naway, others that the Tokugawa troops sent three or four shells into it\r\nand so caused the blaze. At any rate the Satsuma people got into boats\r\nand went down the river, pursued by the Tokugawa men, who fired at them\r\nfrom the banks, and killed two of the fugitives. Sir Harry went to call\r\non Itakura, who told us that the town of Fushimi had been set on fire by\r\nSatsuma troops, who were opposing the entry of the Uyésama's forces into\r\nKiôto. Fighting began at four o'clock, and the result was not yet known.\r\nAnother detachment marching up the Toba road, which follows the right\r\nbank of the river, fell into an ambuscade and was forced to retire. He\r\ncould not tell us when the Uyésama would start. The troops that had been\r\nopposed at Fushimi were his advanced guard, destined to occupy the\r\ncastle of Nijô in Kiôto, as he was returning there shortly, having been\r\ninvited to do so by Echizen and Owari. All the other _daimiôs_ were\r\ntired of the arrogant conduct of Satsuma. Probably it was his troops\r\nalone which had fought at Fushimi. Ishikawa gave me a copy of a letter\r\nfrom the commandant at Fushimi, who writing to Tsukahara and Buzen no\r\nKami mentioned that guns had been lent for the destruction of the\r\nSatsuma _yashiki_. It was reported that Tsukahara had disappeared, and\r\nit was conjectured that he had been shot during the imperialist attack\r\non the official residence of the governor of Fushimi, but we could not\r\nascertain that he had been seen farther on than Yodo.\r\n\r\nNext day the chief went to Itakura's house just inside the Tama-tsukuri\r\nGate near our legation, where he saw Nagai Gemba no Kami. Nagai told us\r\nthat up to last night the Tokugawa troops had been repulsed on both\r\npoints of their advance, and were going to try another road, the Takéda\r\nkaidô, further to the west. To us it appeared that they ought to have\r\ndone better, as they were 10,000 to 6000. They reported the enemy force\r\nto consist of Satsuma and Chôshiû men, assisted by _rônin_, which\r\nprobably meant the men of other clans, but the remaining _daimiôs_\r\nappeared to be preserving a neutral attitude. The Uyésama's\r\ncommander-in-chief was Takenaga Tango no Kami. The denunciation of\r\nSatsuma's crimes was carried by the advanced guard, whom Gemba no Kami\r\ndescribed as the Uyésama's \"retinue.\" He still maintained that the\r\nUyésama had not wished to have recourse to arms, but was forced into it\r\nagainst his will. Still Gemba no Kami could not give a satisfactory\r\nexplanation of the firing on the Satsuma steamer \"Lotus\" as early as the\r\nevening of January 26. The same evening reports came in that the\r\nTokugawa troops had retired 7-1/2 miles from Fushimi, and had destroyed\r\nthe bridge over the Kidzu-kawa river below Yodo, to obstruct the further\r\nadvance of the Satsuma forces. Seven boat-loads of wounded had come down\r\nthe river.\r\n\r\nFrom what we heard on the morning of the 30th, it appeared that the\r\nprospects of the Tokugawa party were not very encouraging. In the\r\nafternoon great fires were distinctly visible from the hill by the\r\ncastle, in the direction of Hirakata and Nashimoto, about half-way\r\nbetween Ozaka and Fushimi, which showed that the battle was approaching\r\nnearer. A consultation was held by the chief with the Legation staff,\r\nthe result of which was that we were to hire as many boats as possible\r\nto convey the archives to the British squadron, and when they were\r\nplaced in safety we should be able to await the development of events\r\nwith calmness. After dinner Sir Harry went to see the French Minister,\r\nand returned about half-past nine with information that a circular was\r\nto be addressed to the foreign ministers announcing that the Uyésama\r\ncould no longer defend them, and they must take their own measures for\r\nthe protection of their flags. At eleven came an official messenger with\r\nthe circular, who promised to get us as many boats as possible on the\r\nfollowing morning to move our baggage; and after packing up the archives\r\nwe went to bed. At four o'clock in the morning, Locock woke me with the\r\nnews that a note had come from the French Minister to say that the enemy\r\nwould enter the city early in the day, and that we must run off at\r\ndaylight with what we could carry. So we all got up, frightfully cold\r\nthough it was, and packed up our belongings. No boats had arrived. At\r\ndaylight my Japanese escort came to say that with the greatest\r\ndifficulty they had managed to procure one large boat; on this the\r\narchives were placed, and started off about nine. Then came Ishikawa,\r\nwho said he was powerless to help us. The imperialists had not yet\r\nappeared, but he considered it advisable for us to get off at once. So\r\nSir Harry and I went off with him to look for the porters, whom we met\r\noutside the great gate of the castle. Just at that moment we saw a\r\ncurious procession going in. It consisted of a palanquin like a\r\n_mikoshi_, one of those gods' litters carried in religious pageants, a\r\nlarge umbrella held over it and two men with lanterns on long poles in\r\nfront. Ishikawa let out that he thought it was conveying a messenger\r\nfrom the Mikado. He and I came back with the porters, and brought the\r\ngreater part of the baggage down to the bank of the stream behind the\r\nlegation, but still there were no boats. So we went off to the\r\ngovernor's residence and tried to interest the officials on our behalf.\r\nThey appeared to be in a state of extreme perturbation, and declared\r\nthat it was impossible to procure any boats. Ishikawa almost shed tears,\r\nand vowed that he would never again try to get boats and porters for the\r\nlegation; it was none of his business. We agreed therefore to deposit\r\nthe greater part of the baggage inside the castle. Luckily however this\r\nproved unnecessary, for when I returned to our quarters I found the\r\nchief radiant with joy, five boats having arrived in the interval. About\r\nten o'clock therefore we were able to make a start for the foreign\r\nsettlement, but I stayed behind with the six men of my Japanese escort,\r\ncapital fellows who had stuck to me ever since we made the journey\r\noverland from Ozaka to Yedo in 1867. I had to procure boats for my own\r\nbaggage, which by an oversight had been left behind, and to get the\r\nstores removed to the castle. However, more boats arrived than had been\r\nexpected, so I put all the baggage on board, including even a huge pot\r\nof mince-meat. Unluckily, a fine gold lacquer cabinet of Mitford's, for\r\nwhich he had recently paid 800 _ichibus_, was overlooked. About noon I\r\nstarted for the foreign settlement in great triumph. There was even a\r\nhouse-boat (_yakata-buné_). I asked a man whom I had never seen before\r\nfor whom this was intended, and was greatly flattered when he replied\r\ninnocently that it was for Satow sama. This enabled me to go down\r\ncomfortably instead of walking the whole distance. On the way we all\r\nnodded and dozed, for we had had no proper night's rest. From time to\r\ntime we were challenged by the posts on the banks, but no attempt was\r\nmade to stop us. On arriving at the settlement I found the wind was\r\nblowing too strongly from the west to allow of our passing the bar at\r\nthe mouth of the river. The chief, Locock, Willis and Wilkinson were all\r\nfast asleep. Captain Bruce, commandant of the infantry guard, and the\r\nconstable had gone off again to the Legation to endeavour to recover the\r\nremainder of our property that had been left behind, and I got\r\nLieutenant Bradshaw a boat with the same object. Towards evening they\r\nreturned. A steam launch from the squadron was lying off the settlement,\r\nand the Legation was located at the vice-consulate there. It was\r\nbitterly cold, and we were glad to get to bed, after what was a very\r\ngood dinner considering the circumstances. The other foreign\r\nrepresentatives were at Tempôzan, at the mouth of the river, in\r\nmiserable huts, and with very little to eat. We felt pity for them,\r\nmingled with pride, when we compared our situation with theirs. Rumours\r\nwere flying about among the townspeople that Keiki had been declared a\r\nrebel (_chô-téki_).\r\n\r\nAbout nine o'clock on the following morning (February 1), Locock and I\r\ntook an escort from the 2/ix detachment and went off to the castle to\r\nsee what was the state of things there. In front of it there was a great\r\ncrowd, and all the gates seemed deserted. We knocked at the governor's\r\ndoor, but got no answer, a clear sign that he and his people had taken\r\nto flight. The crowd laughed. We sent in to the castle by one of my\r\nJapanese escort to inquire who was there, and were told in reply that\r\nKeiki had departed, leaving it empty. We went on to the Legation, where\r\nwe found everything just as we had left it. We got back by noon, and as\r\nwe were at lunch there came in a detachment of thirteen Frenchmen, who\r\nin return for being stoned by the crowd had fired and killed some eight\r\nor nine people. This was looked upon as a wholesome lesson to the rabble\r\nnot to cry out abuse of foreigners, but nevertheless was much to be\r\nregretted, as it would tend to make the foreign colleagues believe Ozaka\r\nunsafe for themselves. During our walk to the castle and back we had\r\nobserved no signs of hostility, a fact which seemed to show that the\r\npopulation were able to distinguish between nationalities. The French\r\nLegation had been pillaged and the furniture smashed.\r\n\r\nAfter lunch, Sir Harry, Willis and I went down to Tempôzan, the chief to\r\ncall on his colleagues, Willis to attend to the wounds of some Aidzu men\r\nwho had been brought down from Kiôto, where they had fought against the\r\nimperialists. The colleagues were furious with Sir Harry for having been\r\nso fortunate as to save all his baggage and archives, and for having had\r\nthe pluck to remain four miles nearer the supposed danger than they had.\r\nA rather angry discussion ensued. Sir Harry declared that he would not\r\nleave Ozaka unless he was able to carry off every atom of Legation\r\nproperty, and he did not know when that might be possible. They, on the\r\ncontrary, said that having struck their flags, it was their intention to\r\nmove across to Kôbé (Hiôgo), and await the course of events. I went to\r\nmake friends with some of the Aidzu wounded, who were waiting for boats\r\nto put them on board of Tokugawa ships. They asserted that they would\r\nhave beaten the enemy if they had been properly supported, but Tôdô had\r\nturned traitor at Yamazaki (on the right bank of the river, nearly\r\nopposite Yodo), which was the most important point of the defence, and\r\nKeiki's general Takénaga had gone over to the enemy at Yodo itself.\r\nMoreover, the drilled infantry were useless; if one man ran the rest\r\nfollowed like a flock of sheep (as we should say). They estimated the\r\nSatsuma force at the low figure of 1000, but said the skirmishing of the\r\nenemy was very good, and they were armed with breech-loaders. Keiki had\r\nrun away, they knew not whither, but probably to Yedo. We found that the\r\nfort at Tempôzan, and one a little further up the river, which had\r\nhitherto been under the charge of Kôriyama (a Kiûshiû _daimiô_) had been\r\ndismantled, the guns in the former being spiked, and the ammunition\r\nembarked in the Tokugawa warship \"Kaiyô-maru,\" which left at noon. Keiki\r\nwas believed to be on board of her. Old Hirayama was in the fort at\r\nTempôzan, but studiously concealed himself. Chanoine (many years\r\nafterwards for a brief period French Minister of War) and another\r\nofficer of the French military mission had arrived the previous night\r\nfrom Yedo, but had had to leave again, greatly disappointed that they\r\nhad come too late for the fair. Obviously it had been intended that they\r\nshould act as advisers to Keiki's commander-in-chief. The town of Sakai\r\nwas reported to have been burnt, and also the houses round the\r\nNamba-bashi bridge over the Yamato-gawa, but it was not known whether by\r\naccident or intentionally. No Satsuma men had yet entered Ozaka. The\r\nFrench Minister was our authority for a story that Keiki, on finding\r\nthat the majority of the _daimiôs_ were arrayed against him, had\r\nsurrendered the castle and city of Ozaka to Echizen and Owari, because\r\nthey had been kind and polite to him when they came on their mission\r\nfrom the court! The Aidzu men were very grateful to Willis for the\r\nassistance he gave in attending their wounded, and apparently regarded\r\nthe English as the best and kindest people in the world. It was resolved\r\nby Sir Harry that he should go to Hiôgo in order to avoid a quarrel with\r\nhis colleagues, and I volunteered to remain at Ozaka with Russell\r\nRobertson as acting vice-consul, and half the guard from the 2/ix under\r\nthe command of Bruce, so that the honour of the flag might be\r\nmaintained. It was certain that Noguchi and my Japanese escort would\r\nstand by me, and we were determined to fight to the last if we should be\r\nattacked, but that I did not anticipate. I despatched the Chôshiû\r\nstudent Endo Kiôto-wards to urge that the _daimiôs_ should forthwith\r\nmake their declaration of policy to the foreign representatives, as\r\nMitford and I had given the draft of a notification to our Satsuma\r\nfriends, and there was also my private understanding with Tosa on that\r\nsubject. The Aidzu soldiers at the fort said that Satsuma men had been\r\nfound in the castle in disguise, and that there even were some amongst\r\nKeiki's drilled troops; cunning devils they must have been if all we\r\nheard was true.\r\n\r\nAccordingly on February 2, the chief went away to Hiôgo to arrange for\r\nH.M.S. \"Rattler\" to convey Locock to Yokohama, where he was to be in the\r\ncharge of the Legation, and also for his own temporary withdrawal to\r\nKôbé. About half-past eight in the morning we saw from the\r\nvice-consulate a puff of white smoke ascend in the direction of the\r\ncastle, followed by dense clouds of black smoke. The report soon spread\r\nthat the castle was on fire, and so it was in fact. After breakfast\r\nLocock and I took forty of the 2/ix guard, with Bruce and Bradshaw, and\r\nwent off to see the fire and find out whether our Legation had been\r\nburnt. We marched along the bank of the river to the Kiôbashi gate of\r\nthe castle, and turning in there, found that the granaries and the\r\n_hommaru_ (inner circle) had been set on fire, but no one could tell us\r\nby whom this had been done. The wind was blowing from the north, and\r\nsparks had spread the conflagration to some of the huts previously\r\noccupied by the drilled troops on the south side. We walked round to\r\nTama-tsukuri, where we found that the Legation buildings were being\r\nplundered by people of the lowest class. We pursued some of them, but\r\nwere not in time to put an end to the devastation. All the furniture had\r\nbeen destroyed, and the godown sacked. Unfortunately this contained\r\nMitford's beautiful _étagère_, which had no doubt been carried off.\r\nThere was an immense crowd in front of the castle, and men were pouring\r\nin and out of the gates, but they offered no opposition to us, and did\r\nnot stone us as we might have expected them to do. The mob had, of\r\ncourse, destroyed the official residence of the governors as far as was\r\npossible.\r\n\r\nWe got back to the vice-consulate about mid-day, and found there Endo,\r\nwho had already returned from his mission. He said that two or three\r\nhundred of the Chôshiû folk were already in the castle, and that an\r\nofficial had been left behind to hand the place over to Owari, but the\r\nflames broke out before the ceremony could be completed. Whether the\r\nfire was started by the rabble or by Keiki's followers he did not know.\r\nThe only imperialists who had yet arrived were Chôshiû men.\r\n\r\nAbout two o'clock we left the foreign settlement in a lifeboat with\r\nLocock and Wilkinson, who were to be embarked on board H.M.S. \"Rattler\"\r\nand proceed to Yedo. Halfway down the river we met the steam-launch,\r\nwith two other large boats, bringing the chief and Captain Stanhope of\r\nH.M.S. \"Ocean,\" who, seeing what they took to be a general conflagration\r\nof all Ozaka, had come to take us away and haul down the flag. How angry\r\nI was! We were not in the slightest danger, either of being attacked by\r\nthe victors or from the burning of the castle, and I would have answered\r\nwith my life for the safety of every person left with me. Had I not\r\nreceived repeated assurances from Satsuma, Tosa and Chôshiû that our\r\nLegation would be respected. However, there was no help for it; orders\r\nhad to be obeyed. We found great difficulty in procuring barges, and had\r\nto send the steam-launch out to seize as many as we wanted. We secured\r\nthree, into which we packed everything, including the vice-consul's\r\nfurniture; the archives and the baggage of the 2/ix having been already\r\nstarted off. Everything was got away by half-past six, and we eventually\r\ncrossed the bar in safety. The steam-launch, in which I was, grounded\r\nthree times, and finally stuck fast, but Captain Bullock of H.M.S.\r\n\"Serpent\" fetched me off in his gig. Willis, who, with the safe\r\ncontaining the Legation funds, was in a boat towed by the \"Serpent's\"\r\npinnace, did not get on board till midnight. Then she took all the\r\nbarges in tow, and steamed over to Hiôgo.\r\n\r\nNext morning we landed there, and got the baggage on shore. Most of the\r\nparty found accommodation at the consulate. I took possession of the\r\ndistrict administrator's house, which had been occupied by some\r\ncustom-house officers. The caretaker objected. I insisted however that\r\nas we had been turned out of Ozaka by the _Baku-fu_, we had the best\r\nright in the world to the abandoned accommodation of the _Baku-fu's_\r\nofficials. So I had my baggage carried in and set up house there. Our\r\nchief had quartered himself at the consulate, and the other five foreign\r\nrepresentatives, French, Dutch, American, North-German and Italian,\r\noccupied the custom-house, a large two-storeyed building in foreign\r\nstyle, which the officials would otherwise have set on fire to prevent\r\nit falling into the hands of the victors. The governor, an old\r\nacquaintance of ours named Shibata, had chartered the steamer \"Osaka\" at\r\n$500 a day (say £100) to convey himself and his staff back to Yedo,\r\nwhither he started the same afternoon.\r\n\r\nSatsuma's man Godai, I learnt, had gone to Ozaka the previous night, or\r\nearly that morning, in order to assure the chief that he might safely\r\nremain there, but of course he came too late. The next thing one heard\r\nwas that it had been intended to declare Keiki a rebel if he did not\r\nwithdraw his troops from Ozaka, Kiôto and other points between the two\r\ncities, and that Satsuma, Geishiû, Chôshiû and Tosa were charged with\r\nthe duty of using force to compel obedience if he refused to listen to\r\nthe advice offered to him by Echizen and Owari in the first place. This\r\nseemed to explain his hasty flight, but from any point of view, European\r\nas well as Japanese, it was disgraceful. After informing the diplomatic\r\nrepresentatives that he regarded himself as charged with the direction\r\nof foreign affairs, the only further intimation they received from his\r\nofficials was that he could no longer protect the Legations, but he\r\nnever so much as hinted that he was about to abscond. I was also\r\ninformed that it was intended to invite the ministers to Kiôto, and\r\nKeiki had been ordered to transmit the invitation to them, which of\r\ncourse he omitted to do. In fact the policy of the Tokugawa government\r\nfrom the very beginning of their relations with the outer world of\r\nEurope had been to keep foreigners from coming in contact with the Kiôto\r\nparty; and in this they were heartily assisted by Roches, the French\r\nMinister. I well recollect how, when we went to the castle to see Keiki\r\nafter his retirement from Kiôto, some of the commissioners for foreign\r\naffairs jeered at me, saying, \"Of course you now expect to get to Kiôto,\r\nbut don't be too sure,\" or words to that effect.\r\n\r\nA report having been circulated that somebody, either Satsuma or\r\nTokugawa people, were going to blow up the martello tower which stood at\r\nthe end of the dry river bed between Hiôgo and Kôbé, boats were sent\r\nfrom H.M.S. \"Ocean,\" the French flagship \"Laplace\" and the \"Oneida\"; the\r\ndoor was locked and the key taken away.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XXVI\r\n\r\n                            THE BIZEN AFFAIR\r\n\r\n\r\nON February 4, Bizen troops were passing through Kôbé from the early\r\nmorning, and about two o'clock in the afternoon the retinue of one of\r\ntheir _karô_ shot an American sailor who had crossed the street just in\r\nfront, which according to Japanese ideas was an insult that deserved\r\nmortal chastisement. After that they attempted the life of every\r\nforeigner whom they met, but fortunately without any serious results.\r\nWhat at a later time became the foreign settlement was then an open\r\nplain; at the upper edge of it ran the high road, and as the Bizen\r\npeople passed along they suddenly opened fire, apparently from\r\nbreech-loaders. Then every foreigner was seen scurrying across the plain\r\nfor safety. The American marines immediately started in pursuit, our\r\nguard of 2/ix was called out, and some French sailors were landed. Half\r\nof our guard under Bruce were despatched to occupy the entrance from\r\nKôbé into the foreign quarter, and the other half followed in pursuit.\r\nOn reaching the Ikuta-gawa stream-bed, at the eastern extremity of the\r\nplain, we perceived the Bizen men marching in close column about 600 or\r\n700 yards ahead, so we passed through the gap in the river bank and\r\nopened fire. There were at least half-a-dozen civilians with us, all\r\narmed with rifles, who likewise fired. Willis, Mitford and I had only\r\nour revolvers. At the first volley from our side, the enemy turned into\r\na field by the side of the road, and fired at us from below a bank. On\r\nour returning their fire, they all took to flight. We pursued them,\r\nevery now and then firing at one or other who had failed to get under\r\ncover, but finally they took to the hills and disappeared completely.\r\nSir Harry, followed by his mounted escort of ex-policemen, galloped some\r\ndistance down the road in the direction of Nishinomiya, but was unable\r\nto catch sight of the foe. If any of them had suffered from our fire, he\r\nmust have been carried off by his comrades. Willis found an old peasant\r\nwoman lying by a bank with a bullet wound through both ankles, whom he\r\nbrought back and cured of her hurt. Then we took prisoner a wretched\r\nporter, who escaped with his life by a mere miracle, for at least\r\nfifteen revolver shots were fired at him at close quarters as he rose\r\nfrom his place of concealment, without his receiving a single wound. We\r\nopened the baggage which had been dropped by the fugitives, but found\r\nnothing of value, only three small weapons, representing a cross between\r\na matchlock and a howitzer, and a few carpenters' tools. From the\r\nporter, whom we led home as our prisoner, we ascertained that the\r\ndetachment consisted of two Bizen _karô_, Ikéda Isé and Hiki Tatéwaki,\r\nwho were on their way with about 400 men to reinforce the garrison of\r\nNishinomiya, and that some of them had remained behind at Hiôgo. On\r\nreturning to the settlement we found a quantity more baggage which had\r\nbeen dropped in Kôbé by the men whom Bruce had intercepted. Sentries\r\nwere then posted along the main street of Kôbé as far as the first\r\nbarrier gate, where a strong guard was stationed with a howitzer. A line\r\nof sentries was also drawn round the north and east sides of the plain.\r\nFrom some of these, who were Americans, sailors or marines, an alarm was\r\nraised about ten o'clock. Great alacrity was displayed by the naval\r\npeople; field pieces were landed and numbers of small-arms men. After\r\nall, no enemy made his appearance to justify so great a stir being made.\r\nI proposed to Sir Harry that we should issue a manifesto declaring that\r\nif Bizen's people did not satisfactorily explain their behaviour, the\r\nforeign powers would make it a quarrel with Japan as a whole. He induced\r\nhis colleagues to agree to this, and I started our prisoner back to his\r\npeople with a copy, though I did not feel much confidence in its\r\nreaching its destination. About half-past one, a hundred Chôshiû men\r\nsent down for the protection of Kôbé and Hiôgo against Tokugawa troops\r\narrived just outside our post in the middle of the village, and were\r\nwithin an ace of being fired on by our guard. Luckily I came up at the\r\nmoment, and went to an inn at which they had billeted their rank and\r\nfile, to arrange that they should withdraw, which they did very readily.\r\n\r\nDuring the afternoon, four steamers belonging to Chikuzen, Kurumé,\r\nUwajima, and one it was thought to the Tokugawa, were seized at Kiôgo\r\nand Kôbé, to hold as a \"material guarantee.\"\r\n\r\nThe morning of February 5 brought me again an invitation from Yoshii to\r\nvisit him at Ozaka and talk over affairs, but it was impossible, for I\r\nhad too much on my hands. The \"Whampoa,\" a steamer belonging to Glover &\r\nCo., of Nagasaki, had arrived, and a rumour was invented and spread that\r\nshe was conveying 800 Satsuma troops, so I was sent off in a boat to\r\nstop their landing. There was not a single Satsuma man on board. Some\r\nmen of Awa in Shikoku had decamped in boats from Hiôgo, and our people\r\npursued them, but as they were only a few in number and very miserable\r\nin appearance, they were not molested. We then issued proclamations,\r\nwith the wording of which I was entrusted, explaining why we had seized\r\nthe steamers, a second exhorting the people to go quietly about their\r\nbusiness, and a third announcing that all unarmed persons would be\r\nallowed to pass our posts. About one o'clock a Dutchman (appropriately\r\nenough in accordance with popular notions) raised an alarm that the\r\nJapanese were advancing to the attack. The report spread as far as the\r\nquarters of the Foreign Representatives at the custom-house, where von\r\nBrandt was making a great fuss about a body of at least three hundred\r\narmed men that he asserted were menacing Kôbé from the hills close by on\r\nthe north side. I had a look at them through his glass, and certainly\r\nsaw men, but if they were armed, I was sure they were friendly Chôshiû\r\nmen. So I got leave to take Lieutenant Gurdon of H.M.S. \"Ocean\" with ten\r\nmen, and we started out to explore, and to paste up our proclamations\r\nwherever we found one of Chôshiû's. The only people on the hills turned\r\nout to be peasants. The Chôshiû troops were billeted at Shôfukuji, a\r\nlarge temple, or Buddhist monastery, about two miles away among the\r\nhills, so it was manifest that they were keeping their engagement to us.\r\nWe marched through Hiôgo, and pasted a copy of our first notification on\r\nthe door of the Bizen official hotel (_honjin_), and the whole series of\r\nfour on the house where their troops had passed the night of the 4th.\r\nHaving accomplished all this, we returned to relieve the anxiety of our\r\nfellow foreigners.\r\n\r\nJust as I got back I met Yoshii and Terashima, who had come down to have\r\na talk. The chief gave them a short interview, at which he advised them\r\nto send off at once and get the Mikado's messengers to come down with\r\ntheir notification to the Foreign Representatives. They wanted him to\r\nlet 300 Satsuma troops pass through our lines, but he refused, on the\r\nground that as we did not know anything officially from the Mikado, we\r\ncould not recognize Satsuma as acting under His Majesty's orders. So\r\nthey agreed to bring their men into Hiôgo by another route. Then I went\r\noff with them to their _honjin_ at Hiôgo, and they told me a good deal\r\nabout the course of recent events. Theirs had been a continuous course\r\nof victory from the very first, for being like \"rats in a bag,\" they had\r\nto fight hard for their lives, and were compelled to be victorious. At\r\nFushimi they had had a desperate fight, but after that they pressed on\r\nand drove the Tokugawa forces into Yodo. This place, as well as the long\r\nbridge over the river, was fired by the retreating troops. Aidzu's men\r\nfought very bravely. The plan of the _Baku-fu_ was to get the Satsuma\r\nand Chôshiû soldiers engaged with Aidzu and the _Shin-sen-gumi_ (a body\r\nof armed _samurai_ recently raised), and then to creep round to the\r\nimperialist right with the drilled infantry and seize Kiôto. Higo too\r\nwas only waiting for signs that Satsuma was getting the worst of it, in\r\norder to seize the palace, but now he was very humble. The number of\r\nSatsuma and Chôshiû men actually engaged was about 1500, the remainder\r\nbeing employed in the defence of the city. Anyhow, as the roads to be\r\nheld were very narrow, large bodies could not have been employed to any\r\nadvantage. They loaded their field-pieces with bags of bullets, which\r\ndid great execution on the enemy. About twenty Satsuma men were killed,\r\nand the entire list of casualties did not exceed 150. They took a good\r\nmany prisoners, and captured numbers of guns and small arms, etc. Tôdô's\r\ndefection was a great help to the imperialists. His men had been\r\nfighting against them, but when the Mikado's standards, the sun in gold\r\non a red ground and the moon in silver, were displayed, they lost heart\r\nand changed sides. Another of their advantages was their good\r\nskirmishing. Ninnaji no Miya, a prince of the blood, also known as Omura\r\nno gosho, was the commander-in-chief. They anticipated that all the\r\nclans as far as Hakoné would submit, and that Sendai would join them.\r\nKishiû already showed signs of a desire to come to terms, and Ogaki had\r\nsubmitted, as indeed had nearly all the other clans who had fought, with\r\nthe exception of Aidzu. They said that Iwashita, Gotô and Higashi-Kuzé,\r\nthe latter one of the five runaway court nobles, were to come down to\r\nKôbé to communicate the Mikado's proclamation to the foreign\r\nrepresentatives. It would be the desire of the new government to show\r\nperfect impartiality in its relations with foreign states, but as the\r\nEnglish had been the good friends of the Kiôto party, they would always\r\nbe regarded with particularly grateful and amicable feelings. I remained\r\nwith Yoshii and Terashima till half-past ten in the evening. They seemed\r\nto admit that we had acted within our rights in seizing the steamers,\r\nand while I was with them they wrote and despatched long letters to\r\ntheir own people at Ozaka, explaining the affair and enclosing our\r\nnotification. They also wrote up to Kiôto urging that no time should be\r\nlost in despatching the Mikado's messengers with the announcement to the\r\nforeign ministers.\r\n\r\nEarly on the morning of the 6th Satsuma troops came over from\r\nNishinomiya in large boats, and were landed at Hiôgo, in accordance with\r\nour agreement of the previous day.\r\n\r\nSome retainers of Omura in Hizen, Watanabé Noboru and Fukuzaka Kôzô,\r\ncame to inquire about our intentions with regard to their steamer which\r\nhad been seized, and was now held by the French. The steamer belonged to\r\nUwajima, and was only borrowed by Omura for this trip. So I gave them\r\ncopies of our manifesto against Bizen, and another one explaining why\r\nthe steamers were seized, and they declared themselves quite convinced\r\nthat we had acted rightly. Our bluejackets however and the Americans and\r\nFrench also, were getting us a bad name by committing all sorts of petty\r\npilfering.\r\n\r\nI went to call on Katano, commander of the Chôshiû troops, who said that\r\nthe two Bizen _karô_ had gone to Ozaka or Kiôto, he did not know which,\r\nafter the affray on the 4th, the rank and file remaining behind.\r\n\r\nIt was on February 7th that the Mikado's messenger, Higashi-Kuzé,\r\naccompanied by Iwashita, Terashima and Itô, with a small retinue,\r\narrived at Hiôgo in a little steamer belonging to Geishiû. As soon as I\r\nreceived the note informing me of this, I went over to the chief, on\r\nwhom devolved the task of seeing his colleagues, and arranging with them\r\nthe place and hour of meeting. Apparently they were greatly annoyed,\r\nespecially the French Minister, at finding themselves as it were\r\nignored, and that their English colleague had thus become the channel of\r\ncommunication between the Mikado and themselves. They tried to pump him\r\nabout the contents of the imperial message, but he did not tell them\r\neven the little he knew. It having been decided that the interview\r\nshould take place at the custom-house at noon on the following day, I\r\nwent over to Hiôgo and informed Iwashita. There had been a report that\r\n300 Bizen men had entered the town, but I could not find a trace of\r\nthem. All our marines had been withdrawn on account of the difficulty\r\nexperienced in forming mixed posts, and the Americans now had charge of\r\nthe gate in the middle of the town, so that they would henceforth be\r\nresponsible for all the petty pilfering that went on. I found them most\r\nunpleasantly strict, and because I had no pass they obliged me to go a\r\nlong way round in order to reach my destination and get back again.\r\n\r\nSo on the 8th of February the fateful communication was made by\r\nHigashi-Kuzé at the place and hour previously fixed. Higashi-Kuzé was a\r\nsmall man even for a Japanese, with sparkling eyes, irregular teeth,\r\nwhich were not yet completely freed from the black dye (_o-haguro_) worn\r\nby court nobles, and with a stutter in his speech. The document was\r\ndrawn up in classical Chinese, and might be thus translated:--\r\n\r\n    The Emperor of Japan announces to the sovereigns of all foreign\r\n    countries and to their subjects that permission has been granted\r\n    to the Shôgun Tokugawa Yoshinobu[7] to return the governing\r\n    power in accordance with his own request. We shall henceforward\r\n    exercise supreme authority in all the internal and external\r\n    affairs of the country. Consequently the title of Emperor must\r\n    be substituted for that of Tycoon, in which the treaties have\r\n    been made. Officers are being appointed by us to the conduct of\r\n    foreign affairs. It is desirable that the representatives of the\r\n    treaty powers recognize this announcement.\r\n\r\n    February 3, 1868.                       MUTSUSHITO (L.S.).\r\n\r\n        [7] Keiki, by which he was usually spoken of, is the\r\n            pronunciation of the two Chinese characters with\r\n            which his name Yoshinobu was written.\r\n\r\nThis document was very ingeniously framed. It assumed as a matter of\r\ncourse that the treaties were binding on the Mikado, and therefore only\r\nmentioned them incidentally, in saying that the Mikado's title must be\r\nsubstituted for that of Tycoon. After the translation had been made and\r\nshown to all the ministers, a fire of questions was directed against the\r\nenvoy, who answered them well. Roches asked whether the Mikado's\r\nauthority extended throughout the whole of Japan, to which he replied\r\ncoolly that the rebellion of Tokugawa prevented that from being the case\r\nat present; but it would gradually extend all over the empire. Roches'\r\ninterpreter (who was a Tokugawa man) then made a wilful mistake by\r\nrepresenting the envoy to say that \"if all the people submitted to the\r\nMikado, he would be able to govern the country,\" whereas he really said,\r\n\"the people will all submit to the Mikado as a natural consequence of\r\nhis taking the reins,\" as we ascertained on repeating the question. With\r\nregard to the Bizen affray, the Mikado's government undertook to protect\r\nthe lives and property of foreigners at Kôbé for the future, and to\r\nsatisfy the demands of the Foreign Representatives for the punishment of\r\nBizen. On these conditions, it was agreed that the marines and\r\nbluejackets should be withdrawn to the ships, and the steamers released.\r\nOzaka was not as yet perfectly quiet, but normal conditions would soon\r\nbe restored, and foreigners would be formally invited to return there.\r\nOn the part of the Mikado's government the envoy desired to know whether\r\nthe Foreign Representatives would report the announcement to their\r\ngovernments and proclaim it to their people. This was tantamount to\r\nasking for \"recognition.\" Roches became very angry, and said: \"We must\r\nnot throw ourselves upon the necks of these people,\" whereupon the\r\nItalian Comte de la Tour and the German von Brandt raised their voices\r\nagainst him, and replied that so far from doing anything of the sort we\r\nhad waited till they came to seek us (not knowing, of course, of our\r\nsecret negotiations at the Satsuma _yashiki_ in Ozaka). On this,\r\neveryone said he would report to his government, and that satisfied the\r\nenvoy. A great deal of desultory conversation went on while he was\r\nwaiting for the gunboat to convey him back to Hiôgo, but on no\r\nparticularly important topic. Itô said to me that it was all right about\r\nour going to Kiôto, that there would be no difficulty. I pretended to be\r\nindifferent, though in truth I was very eager to get a view of the city\r\nand its famous buildings, from which foreigners had been so jealously\r\nexcluded for over two centuries.\r\n\r\nNext day Higashi-Kuzé, at his own request, went to visit H.M.S. \"Ocean.\"\r\n\r\nA joint note was sent in to him demanding reparation for the Bizen\r\noffence, namely a full and ample apology and the capital punishment of\r\nthe officer who gave the order to fire. The ministers, and especially M.\r\nRoches, insisted that the fact that they were under fire increased the\r\ngravity of the offence--as if their presence there could have been known\r\nto the Bizen troops passing through on the march. Itô seemed to think\r\nthat the government would agree to make the Bizen _karô_ perform\r\n_harakiri_. He said that Chôshiû had relinquished to the Mikado the\r\nterritories he had conquered in Kokura (on the south side of the strait\r\nof Shimonoséki) and in the province of Iwami. Katsura (_i.e._ Kido) and\r\nItô wanted him to go much farther, and resign to the Mikado all his\r\nlands, retainers and other possessions, except so much as might be\r\nrequired for the support of his household. If all the _daimiôs_ would do\r\nthis, a powerful central government might be formed, which was\r\nimpossible with the existing system. Japan could not be strong as long\r\nas it was open to every _daimiô_ to withdraw his assistance at his own\r\npleasure, and each prince to drill his troops after a different fashion.\r\nIt was the story of the North German Confederation over again; the petty\r\nsovereigns must be swallowed up by some bigger one. The _daimiôs_ of\r\nMatsuyama and Takamatsu in Shikoku, who were partizans of the Tokugawa,\r\nwould be destroyed, and their territories imperialized. Tosa was charged\r\nwith the execution of this measure, having offered to undertake the\r\nduty. It was probable that Himéji, a few miles west of Hiôgo, would also\r\nbe attacked by the imperialists.\r\n\r\nA notification, signed by Iwashita, Itô and Terashima, as officers of\r\nthe Foreign Department, was placarded about the town, informing the\r\npeople that the Mikado would observe the treaties, and enjoining on them\r\nproper behaviour towards foreigners. It was given out that Roches, with\r\nhis interpreter Shiwoda, would leave that evening for Europe, Baron\r\nBrin, the secretary, remaining in charge. The official declaration made\r\nthe day before by the Kiôto envoy had quite thrown him on his beam-ends,\r\nand he could not bear to stand by and see his policy turn out a complete\r\nfailure. His intention was to proceed first to Yokohama, where I\r\nsuspected that he would try to rehabilitate his reputation as a\r\ndiplomatist by some of his artful tricks. However, he thought better of\r\nthis idea, and remained in Japan until matters shaped themselves so that\r\nhe could accept the Mikado's invitation to Kiôto, and so decently\r\nrecognize the new political arrangements. The other ministers behaved\r\nvery correctly, having very little to do but to follow Parkes' lead.\r\n\r\nThe foreign ministers had another interview on February 10 with\r\nHigashi-Kuzé, who was accompanied by Iwashita and Gotô. They told us\r\nthat Itô was to act temporarily as superintendent of customs and\r\ngovernor of the town of Kôbé. It seemed curious, we thought, that a man\r\nof certainly not very high rank should be thought fit for this double\r\npost, and that the common people should be ready to obey him, but the\r\nJapanese lower classes, as I noted in my diary, had a great appetite for\r\nbeing governed, and were ready to submit to any one who claimed\r\nauthority over them, especially if there appeared to be a military force\r\nin the background. Itô had the great recommendation in his favour that\r\nhe spoke English, a very uncommon Japanese accomplishment in those days,\r\nespecially in the case of men concerned in the political movement. It\r\nwould not be difficult, owing to the submissive habits of the people,\r\nfor foreigners to govern Japan, if they could get rid of the two-sworded\r\nclass, but the foreigners who were to do the governing should all of\r\nthem speak, read and write the Japanese language, otherwise they would\r\nmake a complete failure of their undertaking. But as the _samurai_ were\r\nexistent in large numbers, the idea was incapable of realization.\r\nLooking back now in 1919, it seems perfectly ludicrous that such a\r\nnotion should have been entertained, even as a joke, for a single\r\nmoment, by any one who understood the Japanese spirit.\r\n\r\nGotô was to proceed to Kiôto with the joint note about the Bizen\r\nbusiness, and there was every reason to expect that the court would\r\nagree to the infliction of the capital sentence, but they would probably\r\ndesire to let the _karô_ Hiki Tatéwaki perform _harakiri_ instead of\r\nhaving him decapitated. At least that was what I heard privately from my\r\nJapanese friends, who also asked that, until the question was finally\r\ndisposed of, foreigners should abstain from visiting Nishinomiya, where\r\nBizen men were stationed. Everything was now reported to be quiet at\r\nOzaka, and we looked forward to returning there in a few days.\r\n\r\nGotô Kiûjirô, as he had called himself previously, now resumed his real\r\nname of Nakai, and was attached to the Foreign Department. He was a very\r\ncheery and gay personality, always ready for any kind of fun and\r\njollity, and when an entertainment had to be got up, it was to him that\r\nits organization and conduct were entrusted. In this way he earned the\r\nnickname of _Gaimushô no taikomochi_, \"jester of the Foreign\r\nDepartment.\"\r\n\r\nOn the 11th, Higashi-Kuzé with his staff came to the consulate to talk\r\nbusiness with Sir Harry and von Brandt, a talk which lasted three hours.\r\nWe exhibited to them all the Treaties, Conventions and Agreements\r\nrespecting the opening of the ports, all of which had to be confirmed by\r\nthe chief minister for Foreign Affairs, Ninnaji no Miya, a prince of the\r\nblood, in the name of the Mikado. There was much said by way of question\r\nand answer about the recent transactions at Kiôto, which ended in their\r\npromising to furnish a detailed narrative, rebutting the statements made\r\nby Ogasawara Iki no Kami and other supporters of the former _régime_.\r\nThe general council, which Keiki complained had been violently\r\nanticipated by Satsuma, ought to have met on December 15. The western\r\n_daimiôs_ waited a considerable time after this date, but none of the\r\nothers arrived, so they were compelled to take action. The demands made\r\non the _Baku-fu_ were that, together with the governing power, they\r\nshould surrender as much territory as would suffice to maintain that\r\npower. They estimated that 2,500,000 _koku_ of lands would then be left\r\nto the Tokugawa family, besides the territories of the _fudai daimiôs_\r\nand most of the _hatamoto_. Tokugawa had declined, but offered to\r\nsurrender 800,000 _koku_ of lands, and to continue his subsidy for the\r\nsupport of the imperial establishment. When leaving Kiôto however he had\r\nagreed to make the surrender demanded of him, though this was\r\nstrenuously opposed by Aidzu and Kuwana. Then when Echizen and Owari\r\ncame down to Ozaka, they invited him back to Kiôto to conclude these\r\narrangements, but it was never intended that Aidzu and Kuwana should\r\nform the van of his retinue, and that was how it happened that fighting\r\nensued. At the date of this conversation nearly all the _daimiôs_ west\r\nof Hakoné had been reduced, or had given in their adhesion, or would\r\nsoon be compelled by force to submit to the Mikado, and thus about seven\r\nout of the eight million _koku_ of lands possessed by Tokugawa would be\r\nactually in the hands of the Mikado. If Tokugawa then submitted, he\r\nwould be left peaceably with the remainder of his possessions. It was to\r\nbe feared however that he would endeavour to regain what he had lost,\r\nand in that case the Mikado's party would destroy him. It was intended\r\nto despatch forces against him by the north-eastern road (which passes\r\nthrough the provinces of Echizen and Kaga), by the central road through\r\nShinshiû, and by the Tôkaidô. Ii Kamon no Kami of Hikoné and later\r\nadherents to the Kiôto party would be placed in the van of the imperial\r\nforces, in order that their fidelity might be tested. The _daimiôs_ of\r\nthe north had nothing to thank Tokugawa for, and there was no reason why\r\nthey should support him. Awa had submitted, and was assisting in\r\ngarrisoning Hiôgo. Prisoners taken in Kiôto during the recent fighting\r\nwould be returned to their homes on the restoration of peace, instead of\r\nbeing put to death according to the ancient Japanese custom in civil\r\nwar.\r\n\r\nWe understood that the Mikado's party intended to call upon the Foreign\r\nPowers to observe strict neutrality.\r\n\r\nA report went about that Nambu Yahachirô and Shibayama Riôsuké, old\r\nfriends of mine in the Satsuma _yashiki_ at Yedo, had been put to death,\r\nthe one by crucifixion the other by simple decapitation, and I felt that\r\nI should like to do something to avenge them, for to western minds the\r\nidea of taking the lives of prisoners was revolting.\r\n\r\nWe heard that old Matsudaira Kansô, the retired _daimiô_ of Hizen, Mr.\r\nFacing-both-ways as he was universally regarded, was expected to make\r\nhis appearance shortly at Kiôto. Also that the governors of Nagasaki had\r\ndeparted, and that the town was occupied by Satsuma, Geishiû and Tosa,\r\nHizen holding the batteries.\r\n\r\nThe mail which reached us on February 13 brought a letter from Iki no\r\nKami to Sir Harry very diplomatically framed, in which Keiki's failure\r\nto reach Kiôto was attributed entirely to the machinations of Satsuma,\r\nand a hope was expressed that a momentary success on the part of the\r\nlatter would not cause the violation of engagements of long standing. He\r\nentirely burked the question put to him by Locock, as to the course the\r\nchief should take in case the Mikado sent an envoy to the Foreign\r\nRepresentatives. The news came from home that Mukôyama,[8] had\r\ncomplained at the Foreign Office of Sir Harry having applied the title\r\nof \"Highness\" to the Tycoon instead of \"Majesty\"; to this Lord Stanley\r\nreplied that he understood there was a higher title than that of _Denka_\r\nin use in Japan, and that consequently _Denka_ could not mean \"Majesty,\"\r\nwhich was the highest designation applicable to any potentate. It was\r\nalso a noteworthy fact that in this letter of Iki no Kami _Heika_ (which\r\nis synonymous with \"Majesty\") was reserved for the Queen, _Denka_ being\r\nused of the Tycoon. As modern slang would have it, this was giving away\r\nthe whole show.\r\n\r\n    [8] Hayato no Shô, who went to Europe for the French Exhibition\r\n        of 1867.\r\n\r\nGodai and Terashima came to see me, after which they had a long talk\r\nwith the chief on political matters. They told him that in three weeks\r\nor a month's time affairs would have made sufficient progress at Kiôto\r\nto enable the government to invite the Foreign Representatives thither\r\nin order to enter on friendly relations. They also asked for the loan of\r\na surgeon to attend to their wounded at Kiôto. The chief replied that\r\nthe alleviation of suffering in the case of any human being was always a\r\npleasure, and that as the Legation doctor had looked after the wounds of\r\nAidzu men, no objection could exist to his treating the hurts of others;\r\nbut his consent would depend upon the nature of the reply the ministers\r\nreceived about the Bizen affair. The question of the Legation returning\r\nto Ozaka was mooted, and Buddhist temples were offered for our\r\naccommodation as the buildings which we had occupied behind the castle\r\nhad been too much knocked about to be fit for a residence; but this\r\nwould not matter much, as they would be occupied only temporarily. Godai\r\nand Terashima were very anxious that I, and I alone, should visit Ozaka\r\nat once. (In fact I believed I could have gone anywhere that I liked,\r\nfor instance to Kiôto the next day, by only expressing a wish.) Godai\r\nwanted to buy an English man-of-war with which to attack Yedo; it was a\r\ncurious notion that we had H.M. ships for sale. I advised them to get\r\ntheir Note demanding neutrality on the part of all Foreign Powers sent\r\nin at once, because then they could request the American Minister to\r\nprevent the \"Stonewall Jackson\" being delivered to the Tokugawa people,\r\nas well as the two iron-clads from France which were expected. Godai\r\nsaid further that Uyésugi and Sataké, two _daimiôs_ of Déwa province,\r\nhad asked to have the duty of chastising Aidzu entrusted to them, and\r\ntheir request had been granted.\r\n\r\nNext day they brought Notes from Higashi-Kuzé enclosing copy of the\r\ninstructions he had received from Daté Iyo no Kami (Uwajima) and Sanjô\r\nSanéyoshi (one of the fugitive court nobles) accepting on behalf of the\r\nMikado's government the terms of settlement of the Bizen affair laid\r\ndown by the Foreign Representatives, namely the capital punishment of\r\nthe officer who had given the order to fire on foreigners and the\r\napology. The ministers expressed themselves gratified with the\r\npromptness of the reply, which was received twenty-four hours before the\r\nexpiration of the delay accorded. They said they would wait three or\r\nfour days for the letters of apology and for the announcement of\r\ndetailed arrangements for carrying out the execution. Godai and\r\nTerashima stated that if Bizen were to refuse to surrender the officer,\r\nthe Mikado's troops would compel obedience. They also brought a Note\r\nfrom Ninnaji no Miya, ratifying the Treaties and all subsequent\r\nengagements in the name of the Mikado, and notifying his own appointment\r\nas Chief Administrator of Foreign Affairs, with Daté, Sanjô and\r\nHigashi-Kuzé as his assistants. There was also a Note demanding strict\r\nneutrality on the part of the British Government and its subjects, and a\r\nlike Note to each of the other Representatives. Facsimiles of the\r\nMikado's notification to the Treaty Powers were also handed to those of\r\nthe ministers who had not yet received it. The request for Willis to go\r\nto Kiôto to treat the wounded was repeated and granted, and a proposal\r\nmade by myself to accompany him was accepted with alacrity.\r\n\r\nNews was received that day from Nagasaki that the withdrawal of the\r\ngovernor Kawadzu Idzu no Kami had been quietly effected on the night of\r\nthe 7th, and a provisional government formed on the following day of all\r\nthe _daimiôs_' agents in the port, thirteen clans in all. The direction\r\nof local affairs had been offered by the governor to Hizen and Chikuzen,\r\nbut they declined undertaking such a responsibility without the\r\nco-operation of the other clans. All the subordinate custom-house\r\nofficials and interpreters, as well as 500 troops raised at Nagasaki for\r\ndefensive purposes, were taken over by the provisional government, so\r\nthat the business of the port had not been interrupted for a single day.\r\nA few fires broke out, but were soon extinguished.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XXVII\r\n\r\n                          FIRST VISIT TO KIOTO\r\n\r\n\r\nThe next day was taken up with our preparations for Kiôto, including the\r\npurchase of sufficient stores for a fortnight. Saionji Yukiyé of Uwajima\r\ncalled, and I offered him a passage to Ozaka in the gunboat which was to\r\nconvey Willis and myself to the starting-point of our journey. A Satsuma\r\nman named Oyama Yasuké,[9] whom I had known in Yedo, came to announce\r\nhimself as commander of our escort. That European surgical skill was\r\nvery necessary for the treatment of the wounded can be seen from the\r\nfact I find recorded in one of my letters home, that the Japanese\r\nsurgeons had sewn up all the gunshot wounds, and some of their patients\r\ndied from this cause. The prospect of visiting the city from which\r\nforeigners had been rigidly excluded ever since the ports were opened in\r\n1859 was enticing, especially as we were now being invited thither by\r\nthe very people who, we were told by the Tycoon's officials, had all\r\nalong tried to keep us out.\r\n\r\n    [9] Afterwards Field-Marshal Oyama, Commander-in-chief in\r\n        Manchuria in 1904-5 in the Russo-Japanese War.\r\n\r\nSir Harry was now in high spirits and in very good temper. We had no\r\nmore of the interviews with Japanese officials at which he used strong\r\nlanguage, and interpreting for him, which used to be a painful duty, was\r\nchanged into a labour of love. Success makes a man kind, and certainly\r\nSir Harry had been successful. By the departure of the French Minister\r\nhe became the _doyen_ of the diplomatic body, and the rest of his\r\ncolleagues followed his lead with perfect unanimity, for they had begun\r\nto see that his policy was the right one to adopt. It was his influence\r\nthat induced his colleagues to join him in issuing declarations of\r\nneutrality in the conflict between the Mikado and the Tycoon, which\r\namong other things prevented the delivery to the latter of the American\r\niron-clad ram \"Stonewall Jackson,\" bought with Japanese money. These\r\ndeclarations were subsequent to the departure of M. Roches to Yokohama,\r\nand while his secretary Baron Brin was in charge of the French Legation.\r\n\r\nWe started about nine o'clock in the morning of February 16 on board the\r\ngunboat \"Cockchafer,\" having in our train Noguchi, a boy-pupil named\r\nTetsu, one of my Japanese escort named Matsushita, and Willis' servant\r\nthe faithful Sahei. Off the Ozaka bar we found the Satsuma steamer\r\n\"Keangsoo\" and another engaged in disembarking a large body of troops.\r\nOn landing at the city we found lodgings had been taken for us at a\r\nBuddhist temple close to a burnt Satsuma _yashiki_ called Takamatsu, and\r\nno sooner had we seated ourselves than a messenger arrived, in the\r\nperson of Koba Dennai's secretary, to ask us to stop two or three days\r\nin Ozaka so that Willis might see some men who were ill of fever, and\r\nthat boats to convey us up the river were not obtainable. We replied\r\nthat Willis had not made any preparations for treating fever patients,\r\nand had brought appliances for wounds only; that we supposed boats were\r\nas numerous at Ozaka as they had been before the recent fighting\r\nup-river, and that we could not understand this delay being interposed,\r\nafter we had been so urged and hurried by Iwashita and Terashima, who\r\nhad wished us to start even a day earlier than we had found possible.\r\nSo the secretary went out, and Yasuké after him. They stayed away a\r\nwhole hour, and we came to the conclusion that the permission to bring\r\nus into Kiôto had been revoked, resolving to return to Kôbé rather than\r\nwaste our time at Ozaka. At four o'clock Oyama returned, bringing with\r\nhim an old, ugly, mis-shapen fellow named Ijichi Shôji, who appeared to\r\nbe one of the Satsuma generals. After bestowing on us a vast quantity of\r\ncomplimentary phrases, this individual brought out in a jerky St Vitus'\r\ndance sort of way the same sort of excuses as had been made by Koba's\r\nsecretary. To this we returned the same answer as before, with the\r\naddition that if they found it inconvenient to receive us in Kiôto, we\r\nwould go back at once to Kôbé. This decided attitude induced Ijichi to\r\ngive orders at once for boats to be got ready, and we then went off to\r\nsee the castle ruins. There was a notice at the front gate refusing\r\nentrance to any but Satsuma and Chôshiû men, but as we had one of the\r\nformer clan with us we found no difficulty in gaining access. Passing\r\nthrough the gate we came upon a wide scene of desolation. The\r\nwhite-plastered towers and wall of the inner moat were gone; all the\r\nbarracks and towers of the outer wall to the south likewise; only the\r\nstones of the gateway to the right remained. We passed into the\r\n_hommaru_ or keep, through the gateway constructed with huge blocks of\r\nstone, the largest measuring 42 by 16 feet and 35 by 18 feet. Nothing\r\nwas left but the masonry, giving somewhat of the look of the ancient\r\nGreek Cyclopean walls of Tiryns. The magnificent palace itself had\r\ndisappeared; all that there was to show where it had once stood was a\r\nlevel surface covered with half-calcined tiles. The way to the\r\nfoundation tower of the _tenshi_ remained clear, and we mounted to the\r\nsummit. Here in the exfoliation of the stones were traces of a former\r\nconflagration; a plaster wall built right round had escaped not only the\r\nflames, but also the explosion of the great magazine close underneath.\r\nFour doors in this wall gave on to the outer parapet, from which the\r\nview of the river, with its three great bridges, winding through the\r\ncity to the sea, and the hills on the further side of the bay surpassed\r\nanything I had ever seen. In the opposite direction the stream could be\r\ndistinguished here and there as it meandered through the fields down\r\nfrom Fushimi. The interior of the castle had been completely destroyed,\r\nwith the exception of a few rows of store-houses, which had escaped\r\nthrough being situated to windward of the flames. The three concentric\r\nwalls of masonry, including the one from which we looked, reminded one\r\nof the appearance that West's Tower of Babel would have presented if\r\nviewed from above. We sounded the well, whence is drawn the famous\r\n_ô-gon-sui_, or golden water, and found the depth to be 140 feet.\r\nIssuing again from the gate at the base of the _tenshi_, we came upon a\r\nquantity of burnt armour and helmets piled up round a store-house which\r\nthe flames had spared; some had been melted by the violent heat into an\r\nirregular mass of metal. There were also piles of thousands of matchlock\r\nbarrels, with a few rifles among them. Curious to see what had become of\r\nour temporary legation buildings, we took our way out of the ruined\r\nTamatsukuri gate. The whole place, excepting the houses that had been\r\noccupied by Mitford and myself, was level with the ground, and even they\r\nhad been gutted so completely by the rabble as to be quite beyond the\r\npossibility of repair. It was a melancholy sight.\r\n\r\nOn returning to our lodging we found Godai, who with many profuse\r\napologies conducted us to a house close by which was better fitted for\r\ninhabitation by human beings. He explained that we could not start for\r\nKiôto before the following morning. From what he said it appeared that\r\ndelay in issuing the permission from the Imperial Court for our entrance\r\ninto Kiôto was caused by Ninnaji no Miya's having unexpectedly gone\r\nthere himself, but as he, Godai, had at once despatched a messenger, the\r\npass would be received at Fushimi the next evening before our arrival\r\nthere. This arrangement being accepted by us, _saké_ and its\r\naccompaniments were ordered in, and half-a-dozen singing girls attended\r\nto help us pass away the time.\r\n\r\nFebruary 17, at ten o'clock in the morning, saw us start in a houseboat\r\nfrom the stairs below the burnt Satsuma _yashiki_. The party, seven in\r\nnumber, included our merry friend Oyama, and another officer in command\r\nof a guard for our protection. Although we had only just breakfasted,\r\n_saké_ and various dishes were soon introduced, and the entertainment\r\nwas repeated all through the day at short intervals. It was a fine\r\nmorning, and the scenery was as beautiful as on the previous occasion in\r\nMay, when Willis, Wirgman and I had made the same journey. Conversation\r\nnaturally turned for the most part on the incidents of the recent\r\nfighting. The Tokugawa forces had been pressing all day along the Toba\r\nroad until four o'clock, when they made an attempt to force the Satsuma\r\nposition. The attack was met by a steady fire from a field-piece planted\r\nin the middle of the path (for the so-called road was very little\r\nwider), and from three others in position on the left, while troops\r\nconcealed in the brushwood opened on them with musketry. This unexpected\r\nreception threw the Tokugawa men into confusion, and they retired\r\nprecipitately leaving numbers of dead and wounded on the ground. The\r\nimperialists at Fushimi, on hearing the sound of firing in the direction\r\nof Toba, from which place they were about a mile distant, attacked the\r\nTycoon's troops as they formed outside the governor's residence, and the\r\nfighting lasted till the middle of the night. The officers on the\r\nTycoon's side set the example of flight, and their men could not resist\r\nthe temptation, so that the rout became general. After Yodo was passed\r\nno more fighting occurred on the road to Ozaka. At Hirakata the drilled\r\ninfantry broke into the storehouses of the townspeople who had run away,\r\nand disguised themselves in the finest garments they could find; other\r\ntownspeople pursued the marauders and killed six of them.\r\n\r\nWe passed Hirakata at four, but did not reach our hotel at Fushimi till\r\nmidnight. Tôdô was holding his old post at Yamazaki, and Kaga occupied\r\nHashimoto. Dear old Yoshii was at our hotel to welcome us, and more\r\nrespectably dressed and shaven than I had seen him for a long time past.\r\nA fresh supply of _saké_ was produced, and we kept up the conversation\r\ntill past two in the morning. These late hours did not prevent our being\r\nready to start at ten o'clock, escorted by a company of eighty-eight\r\nmen. Large palanquins of the sort called _kiri-bô kago_, that is \"with a\r\nPaulownia-wood pole,\" used by personages of the highest rank, had been\r\nprovided for us, but Willis, who was 6 feet 3 high and big in\r\nproportion, was not able to double himself up inside, and preferred to\r\nwalk. The route lay through Fushimi for some way, issuing on to the\r\nTakéda road, fifteen feet wide, then ascended to the top of a dyke\r\nconstructed to keep the river within bounds, crossed a bridge and so\r\ninto the city of Kiôto. At a temple by the roadside we fell in with\r\nKomatsu, who had followed us from Fushimi, and by one o'clock we arrived\r\nat Sô-koku-ji, a Buddhist temple close to the Satsuma _yashiki_ at the\r\nback of the imperial palace. Shiuri no Taiyu, the Prince of Satsuma,\r\npaid us a visit of welcome, accompanied by his confidential adviser\r\nSaigô. After shaking hands with us both, he sat down in a chair placed\r\nat the end of the table by the door, while we occupied chairs behind the\r\ntable in a position of greater dignity. All his attendants squatted on\r\nthe floor. After the exchange of a few complimentary speeches he took\r\nhis leave, and we accompanied him as far as the door. The grounds of\r\nSô-koku-ji were extensive, and well planted with trees, the temple\r\nitself a fine example of wood architecture, the state apartments divided\r\noff by splendid gold paper screens decorated with landscapes in Indian\r\nink, the coffered ceilings fifteen feet above the floor. To suit the\r\nconvenience of us westerners a table and chairs had been provided, and a\r\nluxurious feast was served immediately after the prince had taken his\r\nleave. In the afternoon Willis went to look after the wounded, while I\r\ntook a walk down to the bookshops in Sanjô-dôri, accompanied by an\r\nescort. It was not until I reached this point that the populace seemed\r\nto be certain that I was a foreigner; one little boy asked whether I\r\nwere not a native of Loochoo. The Tokugawa Castle of Nijô struck me as\r\ninsignificant compared with many a fortress belonging to a small Fudai\r\n_daimiô_. It was then occupied by the troops of Owari; the _yashiki_\r\nwhich had been the head-quarters of Aidzu as military governor of Kiôto\r\nwas tenanted by a few of Tosa's troops. The men who had accompanied me\r\nabout the city took the liberty of sitting down with us to dinner, and\r\nshowed great want of good manners. It was evident that they took a\r\ndeparture from the polite social observances characteristic of the\r\nJapanese to be an evidence of what was held to be civilization, i.e. in\r\ntheir own words _hiraketa_.\r\n\r\nNext day I went to ask Saigô about the settlement of the Bizen affair.\r\nHe replied that Hiki Tatéwaki, the _karô_ who was riding in the\r\npalanquin, could not be regarded as free from blame, and that he would\r\nbe imprisoned in the charge of three clans. The officer who had been\r\nriding on horseback would be executed. The Mikado's inspectors\r\n(_kenshi_) would attend, the sentence would be pronounced, and a copy\r\nwould be furnished to the foreign Representatives. Afterwards the\r\nsentence and an account of the proceedings would be circulated\r\nthroughout the country for the information and warning of others. Saigô\r\nsaid the Mikado's government hoped to be able to keep the whole of Japan\r\nin order, so as to prevent the necessity ever arising for foreigners to\r\ntake the law into their own hands. I said that this view was shared by\r\nSir Harry; that in regard of the Bizen outrage he had felt confident\r\nthat an envoy would be sent from the Mikado, and he had therefore\r\nresisted the solicitations of those around him, who had urged that a\r\nforce should be despatched against the Bizen people at Nishinomiya; he\r\npreferred to leave the opportunity open to the Mikado. Saigô also\r\nexplained the reference in the Mikado's proclamation regarding the\r\nobservation of the treaties, to the \"reform of abuses,\" to mean that the\r\nnew government would propose a revision of those agreements. I mentioned\r\nthree points on which changes were desirable, firstly, the residence of\r\nthe foreign ministers being fixed at Yedo (for it was naturally supposed\r\nthat the government of the country would in future be conducted from\r\nKiôto); secondly, the confinement of foreigners to a radius of ten _ri_\r\n(245 miles) round treaty ports; and thirdly, the circulation of all\r\nforeign coin throughout the country. While abolishing the ten _ri_\r\nlimit, it should be made obligatory on a person travelling about the\r\ncountry to carry a passport signed either by the Minister or the Consul,\r\nand countersigned by the governor of the port from which he set out.\r\nThis last proposal was in fact one made by the Japanese themselves.\r\n\r\nIn the afternoon we went to return the call of the Prince of Satsuma. As\r\nduring his visit yesterday, he scarcely opened his lips, but Willis said\r\nthat he had treated Sir Harry in the same way when he went to Kagoshima\r\nin 1866, and that it was supposed he was advised by his councillors not\r\nto talk, lest he should make a fool of himself; a probable though not\r\nvery charitable explanation. We spent the afternoon in exploring the\r\ncity, which had been little more than half rebuilt after it was burnt in\r\n1864 in the Chôshiû attack on the Palace.\r\n\r\nNext day I went with Yoshii to call on Gotô, to whom I spoke about the\r\nBizen affair. He told me pretty much the same thing as Saigô, but less\r\ndecisively. He talked of executing the man who used his spear before the\r\nfiring began. Then he discussed the new constitution, and said he\r\ndespaired of getting a deliberative assembly, because the majority would\r\nalways be stupid and wrong-headed. I advised him to make the experiment\r\nnevertheless; if the members ran their heads against a block of stone,\r\nthey would learn reason from the blow. He seemed to favour the idea of\r\ngoverning by a _junta_ composed of the prime minister and the cleverest\r\nmen in the country, in default of one man of heroic mould, who should\r\nrule autocratically. Of course he included himself among \"the cleverest\r\nmen\" (_jinketsu_). During this part of our conversation Gotô had\r\nexcluded Yoshii, as well as Saionji of Uwajima, who happened to be\r\ncalling on him, and Yoshii expressed his annoyance to me afterwards at\r\nhaving been treated with so little confidence. I pacified him by saying\r\nthat we had been discussing the settlement of the Bizen affair. After\r\nthese two were admitted some general conversation ensued among them,\r\nfrom which I gathered that it was by no means decided as yet who was to\r\nbe what, and that the chief men of the different clans found it\r\ndifficult to manage each other, that mutual jealousy, and especially\r\njealousy of Satsuma, prevented their pulling together. I gave them a\r\nhint to use in revising the treaties, namely, the establishment of mixed\r\ncourts for trying cases between foreigners and Japanese, instead of\r\ndeciding them according to the laws of the defendant's nationality. I\r\nalso called on Katsura (Kido), but we did not meet till the next day,\r\nwhen he came to our lodging in company with a Chôshiû naval captain\r\nnamed Shinagawa, who for some time past had been living in Kiôto as a\r\nSatsuma man. Yoshii also turned up, but the conversation flagged until\r\nWillis came back from the hospital, and during lunch a heated argument\r\narose as to the best way of preventing affrays from happening between\r\nJapanese and foreigners. Katsura and I had previously agreed that the\r\nJapanese Government should discuss the procedure with the foreign\r\nrepresentatives; foreigners should be informed that to break through a\r\nprocession is an offence in Japanese eyes, and Japanese on the other\r\nhand should be taught that they must not use weapons, but simply arrest\r\noffenders and hand them over to their own authorities; further, that\r\nwhen a _daimiô's_ train was to pass along a thoroughfare, constables\r\nfrom a mixed force of westerners and Japanese should be stationed to\r\nkeep the road clear. Willis dissented from this view, and maintained\r\nthat the only way to preserve the peace between foreign rowdies and\r\nJapanese bullies was to keep them apart, and to carry the high road\r\nround at the back outside Kôbé. My argument against this, in which\r\nKatsura concurred, was that a change of road would give rise to a great\r\ndeal more ill-will between the opposite nationalities than the murder of\r\na few foreigners, and that from what we had hitherto seen in this\r\ncountry a little fighting would open the eyes of the Japanese and make\r\nus all better friends than before; in fact, we held it was better to\r\napply caustic at once than to let the disease linger on and attempt to\r\ncure each symptom as it presented itself. We did not settle the\r\nquestion, but I noted down what precedes as being a Japanese view.\r\n\r\nIn the evening I went to call on Okubo Ichizô, a Satsuma _karô_, who was\r\none of the councillors of the Home Department. Last year he and I had\r\nsent presents to each other, but had never met, so I wished to make his\r\nacquaintance. Instead of merely exchanging formalities, we had some\r\ninteresting conversation. He said that 7000 infantry were being sent\r\nforward to Hakoné, and 5000 to a pass on the Nakasendô. Satsuma and\r\nChôshiû were determined to prosecute the war, and perfect unanimity\r\nprevailed among the _sanyo_ (councillors). Even Echizen and Higo, who at\r\nfirst had been opposed to the employment of force, were now working\r\nhand-in-hand with the other clans. The _daimiô_ of Ogaki, who was a\r\ncouncillor of the Finance Department, until recently an adherent of the\r\nTokugawa, had expressed his hope that the expedition against Yedo would\r\nsoon be sent on its way. Probably the Mikado would accompany the army in\r\nperson, a step which would greatly weaken the rebels. He thought that\r\nthe return of M. Roches to France would have the effect of determining\r\nthe Tycoon to submit, as he would have no one to rely on for material\r\nassistance. If he submitted, his life might be spared, but Aidzu and\r\nKuwana must lose their heads. At Ozaka the discovery had been made of\r\nthe diary kept by a confidential adviser of Keiki's, in which the false\r\nhopes that had given rise to the expedition against Kiôto at the end of\r\nlast month were plainly expressed; the other clans were represented as\r\ngetting tired of Satsuma, and even Chôshiû to be divided into two\r\nparties, one for war the other for peace; that Gotô Shôjirô was inclined\r\ntowards making terms with the Shôgun, and that the Court desired to see\r\nhim back in Kiôto. But, said Okubo, Keiki was in too much of a hurry,\r\nand now the whole situation had completely changed; those who previously\r\nhad wavered were now convinced of the _Baku-fu's_ weakness, and were\r\neager to be first in striking a blow at the Tokugawa. At his request I\r\nexplained to him as well as I could the working of our executive\r\ngovernment in combination with the parliamentary system, the existence\r\nof political parties and the election of members of the lower house. The\r\nBizen affair he said was pretty well settled, and his account agreed in\r\nthe main with what Saigô and Gotô had told me. Next day however there\r\narrived a very peevish letter from the chief, complaining that the Bizen\r\nbusiness did not appear to be nearing a settlement, that sufficient\r\npreparations had not been made at Ozaka for the reception of the Foreign\r\nRepresentatives, that he doubted whether he would ever go there at all,\r\nand winding up by ordering Willis and myself to rejoin him by the 24th\r\nat latest. This gave me one day more at Kiôto, but it considerably upset\r\nWillis' arrangements, as he had calculated on a fortnight's stay. Okubo\r\nhaving called to return my visit, and Yoshii also, I took the\r\nopportunity of urging on them the necessity of settling Bizen at once.\r\nThey replied that they did not belong to the department concerned, but\r\nundertook to see Gotô and Higashi-Kuzé, and repeat to them what I had\r\nsaid. I had to go, but left Willis to await further orders. On the 23rd\r\nSaigô came to say good-bye to me, and present me with two large rolls of\r\nred and white crape and two of gold brocade. He said there was no\r\npossibility of my carrying back the final decision of the Bizen affair.\r\nWhen he was gone, Yoshii came in; he told me Sir Harry perfectly well\r\nunderstand the cause of the delay, and had consented to wait a week. A\r\nletter had gone from Higashi-Kuzé to him, which had probably crossed his\r\nto me. The final decision would probably be arrived at on the morrow or\r\nthe day after. Daté (Uwajima) and Gotô would go down next day to Ozaka,\r\nand Higashi-Kuzé would follow with the sentences of the Bizen men as\r\nsoon as they were made out. Both Saigô and Yoshii begged that Willis\r\nwould stay five or six days longer.\r\n\r\nThe war news was that the town and territory of Kuwana had submitted to\r\nthe imperial messenger, but the retainers replied that they could not\r\nundertake for their prince, who was in Yedo, having accompanied Keiki\r\nthither. Everyone in Kiôto hoped that the Yedo people would resist\r\ninstead of peaceably submitting, for the western men were all \"spoiling\r\nfor a fight.\"\r\n\r\nAt three o'clock in the afternoon I therefore set out alone. It took me\r\na long time to get through the city to the Gojô bridge, as I completed\r\nmy sight-seeing as I went, and I did not reach Fushimi till dark. There\r\nI found Oyama's elder brother, who was Satsuma agent (_rusui_), and from\r\nwords dropped by Notsu, the captain of my escort, I learnt that the\r\norders to march on Yedo were expected to be issued in a day or two. At\r\nnine o'clock we embarked for Ozaka in a fifty _koku_ flat-bottomed boat,\r\nlong and narrow, with a roofing of coarse straw mats supported by\r\nrafters resting on a pole laid from one end of the boat to the other,\r\nhorribly uncomfortable, and especially so when crowded. We got to our\r\ndestination at 6.30 next morning, and I crossed to Hiôgo in the gunboat.\r\nNotsu said that in the recent fighting the heads of all the wounded who\r\ncould not escape had been taken off, a proceeding hardly reconcilable\r\nwith what we had been told about the resolution to spare the lives of\r\nprisoners; unless, indeed, it was done to put them out of their pain.\r\n\r\nThe next entry in my journal is of February 29th, when Daté came over\r\nfrom Ozaka. On arriving he went to the consulate by invitation from the\r\nchief to have lunch, and began to talk about the Foreign Representatives\r\nbeing presented to the Mikado, who was to be brought down to Ozaka,\r\nperhaps by March 13. We had to stop this interesting communication in\r\norder that he might go to call on the other ministers. In the evening I\r\nwent to see him, when he told me M. Roches had asked to see Saigô,\r\nOkubo, Komatsu and Gotô, as he understood they were the leaders of the\r\nKiôto movement; this had greatly annoyed the dear old man, who resented\r\nbeing ignored in that fashion, and said he hated Roches and his\r\ninterpreter. Roches had sent to say he would call next morning, and it\r\nwas with difficulty that I persuaded him to receive the visit, instead\r\nof going on board H.M.S. \"Ocean\" on Sir Harry's invitation. Inouyé\r\nBunda, whom I saw that day, told me the French consul at Nagasaki had\r\nrefused to pay duties to the provisional government, and had threatened\r\nwar, especially against Satsuma and Chôshiû. We had a good laugh over\r\nthis exhibition of impotent wrath.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XXVIII\r\n\r\n          _Harakiri_--NEGOTIATIONS FOR AUDIENCE OF THE MIKADO\r\n                                AT KIOTO\r\n\r\n\r\nNEXT day Daté introduced to the Foreign Representatives Sawa Mondô no\r\nKami, one of the five fugitive court nobles of 1864, who was proceeding\r\nto Nagasaki as governor, together with the _daimiô_ of Omura, who was to\r\nfurnish his guard. Sawa wore rather a forbidding expression of\r\ncountenance, not to say slightly villainous, but for all that had the\r\nlook of a good companion, and a year or two later, when he was minister\r\nfor Foreign Affairs, we liked him greatly. Omura Tango no Kami, to give\r\nhim his full title, was a weak, sickly looking man, who did not utter a\r\nword during the interview, and seemed even afraid of speaking to a\r\nforeigner. Sawa's son, a dissipated-looking young man, with the white\r\ncomplexion of a woman, was also present. After the compliments were\r\nover, these three were turned out of the room, and we learnt that the\r\nBizen affair would be wound up by the decapitation of the responsible\r\nofficer. Early that morning the chief had been asking my opinion about\r\nthe advisability of granting a reprieve, or rather a mitigation of the\r\npenalty. Mitford learnt from von Brandt that the colleagues knew him to\r\nhave leanings that way, and that he was believed to have put forward\r\nPolsbroek, the Dutch Political Agent, to advocate clemency. Mitford and\r\nI had however agreed previously that lenience would be a mistake, and\r\nthat was the view I maintained in reply to Sir Harry. Daté and Sawa came\r\nto dinner that evening with the chief, an arrangement which he fancied\r\nhe had kept secret from his colleagues, but they knew of it as soon as\r\nthe invitation was accepted. Afterwards there was a long conversation\r\nwhich lasted until midnight, a principal topic being the proposed visit\r\nof the Mikado to Ozaka. Daté said the object of the excursion was to\r\nopen the mind of the young sovereign by showing him something of the\r\nouter world, and also a big English man-of-war. Of course, he added, if\r\nthe foreign diplomats were there at the time, they might be presented.\r\nParkes said the Mikado might receive the Diplomatic Body as a whole, but\r\nnot each minister separately, his object being to secure priority of\r\npresentation for himself, as he had already written home for new\r\ncredentials. Daté suggested that the capital might possibly be moved\r\nfrom its present position to Ozaka, as it was situated at a spot hemmed\r\nin by mountains, to which all supplies had to be transported by water.\r\nMy own belief was that Satsuma and Chôshiû wanted to get the person of\r\nthe Mikado into their own hands in order to make him march with the\r\narmy, and secondly to have him on the sea-coast in order to be able to\r\ncut and run whenever it might become necessary. This was confirmed by\r\nthe fact that the Mikado had issued an order announcing that he was\r\ntaking the field in person. In reply to a question as to the fate of the\r\nex-Tycoon, Daté said it would depend on circumstances, which no one\r\ncould foretell. The people of Ozaka, aware of the anti-foreign policy of\r\nthe late Mikado and the former political opinions of Chôshiû, supposed\r\nthat since the Court and Chôshiû had come into power, foreigners would\r\nbe generally obnoxious, not any longer having the Tokugawa power to\r\ndefend them; that was the reason of the populace having wrecked the\r\nvarious legations. Perhaps the Bizen people had been actuated by the\r\nsame notions. This last suggestion furnished an additional ground for\r\nour refusing to reduce the capital sentence.\r\n\r\nBy this time M. Roches had come back to Kôbé, to the great annoyance of\r\nhis colleagues, who considered that he had played a trick on them in\r\nleaving his secretary here as Chargé d' Affaires, in order that he might\r\nnot be unrepresented, and at the same time playing the part of French\r\nMinister in Yedo.\r\n\r\nIt did not cause us, that is Mitford and myself, much surprise when in\r\nthe afternoon of the next day Godai and Itô came to ask for the life of\r\nTaki Zenzaburô, the retainer of Hiki Tatéwaki, who had been condemned to\r\nperform _harakiri_ as the penalty for ordering his soldiers to fire on\r\nforeigners. A long discussion took place between the foreign ministers\r\nwhich lasted for nearly three hours, in which Sir Harry voted for\r\nclemency, but the majority were for the sentence being carried out. It\r\nwas half-past eight o'clock in the evening when Godai and Itô were\r\ncalled back into the room and told in a few words that there was no way\r\nbut to let the law take its course. So we started at nine o'clock,\r\nMitford and myself, with a single representative of each of the other\r\nlegations. We were guided to the Buddhist temple of Sei-fuku-ji at\r\nHiôgo, arriving there at a quarter to ten. Strong guards were posted in\r\nthe courtyard and in the ante-chambers. We were shown into a room, where\r\nwe had to squat on the matted floor for about three-quarters of an hour;\r\nduring this interval we were asked whether we had any questions to put\r\nto the condemned man, and also for a list of our names. At half-past ten\r\nwe were conducted into the principal hall of the temple, and asked to\r\nsit down on the right hand side of the dais in front of the altar. Then\r\nthe seven Japanese witnesses, Itô, Nakashima Sakutarô, two Satsuma\r\ncaptains of infantry, two Chôshiû captains, and a Bizen _o-metsuké_ took\r\ntheir places. After we had sat quietly thus for about ten minutes\r\nfootsteps were heard approaching along the verandah. The condemned man,\r\na tall Japanese of gentleman-like bearing and aspect, entered on the\r\nleft side, accompanied by his _kai-shaku_ or best men, and followed by\r\ntwo others, apparently holding the same office. Taki was dressed in blue\r\n_kami-shimo_ of hempen cloth; the _kai-shaku_ wore war surcoats\r\n(_jimbaori_). Coming before the Japanese witnesses they prostrated\r\nthemselves, the bow being returned, and then the same ceremony was\r\nexchanged with us. Then the condemned man was led to a red sheet of\r\nfelt-cloth laid on the dais before the altar; on this he squatted, after\r\nperforming two bows, one at a distance, the other close to the altar.\r\nWith the calmest deliberation he took his seat on the red felt, choosing\r\nthe position which would afford him the greatest convenience for falling\r\nforward. A man dressed in black with a light grey hempen mantle then\r\nbrought in the dirk wrapped in paper on a small unpainted wooden stand,\r\nand with a bow placed it in front of him. He took it up in both hands,\r\nraised it to his forehead and laid it down again with a bow. This is the\r\nordinary Japanese gesture of thankful reception of a gift. Then in a\r\ndistinct voice, very much broken, not by fear or emotion, but as it\r\nseemed reluctance to acknowledge an act of which he was\r\nashamed--declared that he alone was the person who on the fourth of\r\nFebruary had outrageously at Kôbé ordered fire to be opened on\r\nforeigners as they were trying to escape, that for having committed this\r\noffence he was going to rip up his bowels, and requested all present to\r\nbe witnesses. He next divested himself of his upper garments by\r\nwithdrawing his arms from the sleeves, the long ends of which he tucked\r\nunder his legs to prevent his body from falling backward. The body was\r\nthus quite naked to below the navel. He then took the dirk in his right\r\nhand, grasping it just close to the point, and after stroking down the\r\nfront of his chest and belly inserted the point as far down as possible\r\nand drew it across to the right side, the position of his clothes still\r\nfastened by the girth preventing our seeing the wound. Having done this\r\nhe with great deliberation bent his body forward, throwing the head back\r\nso as to render the neck a fair object for the sword. The one\r\n_kai-shaku_ who had accompanied him round the two rows of witnesses to\r\nmake his bows to them, had been crouching on his left hand a little\r\nbehind him with drawn sword poised in the air from the moment the\r\noperation commenced. He now sprang up suddenly and delivered a blow the\r\nsound of which was like thunder. The head dropped down on to the matted\r\nfloor, and the body lurching forward fell prostrate over it, the blood\r\nfrom the arteries pouring out and forming a pool. When the blood vessels\r\nhad spent themselves all was over. The little wooden stand and the dirk\r\nwere removed. Itô came forward with a bow, asking had we been witnesses;\r\nwe replied that we had. He was followed by Nakashima, who also made a\r\nbow. A few minutes elapsed, and we were asked were we ready to leave. We\r\nrose and went out, passing in front of the corpse and through the\r\nJapanese witnesses. It was twelve o'clock when we got back to the\r\nconsulate, where we found Sir Harry waiting up to receive our report.\r\n\r\nThe newspaper reports which reached England of this execution, and of\r\nthe subsequent execution by _harakiri_ of eleven Tosa men at Sakai gave\r\na very distorted view of the facts. Charles Rickerby who was the owner\r\nand editor of \"The Japan Times\" of Yokohama was responsible for the\r\nattempts to mislead public opinion in both instances. He invented an\r\naccount of the proceedings witnessed by Mitford and myself which was\r\nentirely false, and wound up by saying that it was disgraceful for\r\nChristians to have attended the execution, and that he hoped the\r\nJapanese, if they took revenge for this \"judicial murder\" would\r\nassassinate gentlemen of the foreign Legations rather than anyone else.\r\nAs for being ashamed of having been present at a _harakiri_ on the\r\nground that it was a disgusting exhibition, I was proud to feel that I\r\nhad not shrunk from witnessing a punishment which I did my best to bring\r\nabout. It was no disgusting exhibition, but a most decent and decorous\r\nceremony, and far more respectable than what our own countrymen were in\r\nthe habit of producing for the entertainment of the public in the front\r\nof Newgate prison. The countrymen of this Bizen man told us that they\r\nconsidered the sentence a just and beneficial one. As regards the case\r\nof the Tosa men at Sakai, no punishment was ever more righteously\r\ninflicted. These Japanese massacred a boat's crew of inoffensive and\r\nunarmed men, who were never alleged to have given the slightest\r\nprovocation. Twenty were condemned to death, and one could only regret\r\nthat Captain du Petit Thouars judged it necessary to stop the execution\r\nwhen eleven had suffered, for the twenty were all equally guilty, and\r\nrequiring a life for life of the eleven Frenchmen looked more like\r\nrevenge than justice.\r\n\r\nA few days afterwards all the ministers returned to Ozaka. We went over\r\non board H.M.S. \"Ocean,\" Captain Stanhope. She was an iron-clad, of 4000\r\ntons, carrying 26 muzzle-loading rifled guns of the Woolwich pattern,\r\nenough to blow any vessel on the station into tiny fragments. With us\r\nwent Daté and Polsbroek, and the transport \"Adventure\" conveyed our\r\nbaggage. Our former temporary residence having been destroyed by fire,\r\nwe were accommodated at temples in Naka-dera-machi, and were fortunate\r\nenough to light upon some of the furniture stolen by the mob after we\r\ndecamped in January. The townspeople recognized us as \"the foreigners\r\nwho ran away the other day,\" but they were very civil, and did not shout\r\nafter us as they rudely did in the last days of the ex-Tycoon's\r\noccupation of the city. From Yedo we heard reports that the feeling\r\namong Tokugawa people was that he should be compelled to perform\r\n_harakiri_ and that his principal advisers should be beheaded, in order\r\nto appease the imperialists. It was difficult not to feel a certain\r\ndegree of sympathy for him, mingled with resentment, for he had let us\r\nbelieve he would fight at Ozaka, while he had made up his mind to beat a\r\nretreat. If he had told us the truth we could have remained there\r\ntranquilly, for we were well assured of the friendliness of Satsuma and\r\nChôshiû.\r\n\r\nThe \"Ocean's\" steam launch landed us at the foreign settlement, and we\r\nmarched through the city with our guard of the 2/ix to our new quarters.\r\nThere had been a great deal of talk about the Mikado being brought down\r\nto Ozaka to see some steamers and to meet the foreign ministers, but I\r\nhoped this would not happen. If we were to have an audience of His\r\nMajesty, we ought to have it at Kiôto, otherwise the ceremony would lose\r\nhalf its significance. In the afternoon Iyo no Kami and Komatsu paid\r\nfriendly visits to Sir Harry. It was evident that we were in a fair way\r\nto regain the diplomatic ascendancy of which we had been deprived by the\r\nrecall of Sir Rutherford Alcock in 1864. When Daté and Higashi-Kuzé\r\ncalled next day on the foreign representatives they came to us last of\r\nall, which was convenient. Sir Harry spoke to them about the proposed\r\naudience of the Mikado. They acknowledged the advantages that would\r\nresult from its taking place at Kiôto instead of at Ozaka, but were\r\nevidently not prepared to promise that immediately. The American,\r\nPrussian and Italian Representatives had told Daté that they wished to\r\nleave in three days' time, thus causing some amount of consternation in\r\nthe minds of the Japanese, who desired to keep them for the audience,\r\nwhile they fully appreciated what the chief told them, namely that the\r\nthree Representatives who wanted to get away would not stop for an\r\naudience which was to be merely incidental to the Mikado's visit to some\r\nJapanese steamers. It would be unsuitable to the dignity of the\r\nRepresentatives to be presented to His Majesty while at Ozaka on a visit\r\nmade ostensibly for a different purpose. I myself greatly hoped that the\r\nway in which the chief had put the matter would induce the Japanese to\r\ninvite the ministers at once to Kiôto. That would be the consummation of\r\nthe imperialist theory and scheme. Von Brandt had said privately that he\r\nwould not accept even if asked, but publicly had said he would, while\r\nthe American Minister was apparently of the same way of thinking. Sir\r\nHarry had proposed that the Mikado should receive the whole Diplomatic\r\nBody together, on one day, and not accord separate audiences until they\r\ncould present credentials, and this suggestion had been readily adopted.\r\n\r\nOn the 7th March an important conference was held between the Foreign\r\nRepresentatives and high Japanese functionaries, Daté, Higashi-Kuzé,\r\nDaigo Dainagon a court noble appointed governor of Ozaka, and _karôs_ of\r\nOwari, Echizen, Satsuma, Chôshiû, Tosa, Geishiû, Hizen, Higo and Inshiû,\r\npractically all the great territorial nobles of the west. It is a\r\nremarkable fact that the princes of Echizen, Bizen and Inshiû, now\r\nranged among the enemies of the Tokugawa, were descended from the\r\nfounder of that house. The conference took place in the vast hall of the\r\nBuddhist temple of Nishi Hongwanji. After the Japanese Ministers had\r\nexpressed their good wishes for the extension of friendly intercourse\r\nbetween Japan and foreign countries, and declared that the _daimiôs_\r\nthere represented heartily supported the foreign policy of the Mikado,\r\ndiscussions arose about the ministers going up to Kiôto for an audience\r\nof the Mikado, about exchange of foreign coin for Japanese and the sale\r\nof land in the foreign settlements at Ozaka and Hiôgo (Kôbé). We were\r\ntold that letters were expected from Kiôto in a day or two fixing a date\r\nfor the audience, so that the ministers could go up one day, see the\r\nMikado on the next, and come down again, thus being absent only three\r\ndays from Ozaka. M. Roches was of course deadly opposed to accepting any\r\nsuch arrangement. Van Valkenburg the American, von Brandt and de la Tour\r\nthe Italian seemed unwilling to commit themselves too deeply with the\r\nimperialists. The chief tried hard to conceal his determination to\r\naccept the invitation in any case, while Polsbroek put on an appearance\r\nof indifference. Roches attempted to get an unconditional refusal\r\nconveyed to the Japanese Ministers, but was unsuccessful thanks to the\r\nwatch I kept over his interpreter Shiwoda, and finally the decision was\r\nleft to depend on the contents of the letters expected from Kiôto.\r\nYamanouchi Yôdô, the older Prince of Tosa, was reported to be very ill\r\nat Kiôto, and the services of Willis were asked for on his behalf. This\r\nrequest was readily acceded to by the chief, and Willis started the same\r\nevening accompanied by Mitford.\r\n\r\nMy personal relations with the Awa clan had long been of an intimate\r\ncharacter, and it was therefore no surprise when Hayamidzu Sukéyomon,\r\nformerly Awa agent at Yedo and now at Ozaka, came to call on me on March\r\n8, bringing a present of silk for Major Crossman in return for the\r\ntreatises on artillery which the latter had sent to Awa no Kami. It was\r\nwith great regret that I learnt from him of the death of that friendly\r\nand hospitable old gentleman on January 30th. His son and successor, who\r\nhad been kept at home till the period of mourning expired, was now\r\nexpected at Ozaka on his way to Kiôto. Hayamidzu brought a budget of\r\nYedo news which mostly proved afterwards to be little better than mere\r\ngossip, such as that Itakura was reported to have committed suicide by\r\n_harakiri_ because the other ministers of state differed from him in\r\nopinion; that the _fudai daimiôs_ and _hatamoto_ talked of compelling\r\nKeiki to disembowel himself; of cutting off the heads of Aidzu and\r\nKuwana in order that those two families might escape destruction. He had\r\nnot heard of Keiki being allowed to retire into private life (_in-kio_),\r\nand thought it absurd to suggest such a step under existing\r\ncircumstances. His conduct had been too shabby for him to become\r\nentitled to such consideration. On the 7th February Hori Kura no Kami,\r\none of the second council, had performed _harakiri_, after having vainly\r\nendeavoured to persuade Keiki to take that step, and offering to\r\naccompany him in the act. All Yedo applauded Kura no Kami and said Keiki\r\nought to follow his example. The _Baku-fu_, said my friend, had no\r\ndesire to fight. The Awa clan was now supporting the Mikado and was\r\ntaking part in the expedition to subjugate Tokugawa, and would like to\r\nmake a declaration to the foreign representatives such as was made by\r\nthe other clans on the previous day.\r\n\r\nIn the afternoon I went to Daté to inquire whether he had any news from\r\nKiôto about the invitation of the ministers. He said they would be asked\r\nto start on the 11th, but the date of the audience not having been\r\nfixed, the invitations could not be sent out. I advised him to go at\r\nonce to invite each of the ministers and to say that the day after their\r\narrival in Kiôto would be appointed for the audience, because he and\r\nHigashi-Kuzé had written asking for that arrangement to be made, and\r\ntherefore no doubt existed that it would eventually be done. So off he\r\nstarted, beginning with the French Minister, who kept him to dinner, but\r\ndeclined going to Kiôto until he could perceive actual evidence of the\r\nMikado's supremacy. He was answered that even were the _Baku-fu_ to be\r\nrestored with all its original powers, the Mikado being undoubtedly the\r\nsovereign of Japan, and the Shôgun only his vicegerent, no offence could\r\npossibly be given by being received in audience by the former. From him\r\nDaté went to the Italian, Prussian, American and Dutch Representatives.\r\nThe first three refused on the ground of pressing business at Yokohama,\r\nbut the last said he would act in the same way as the British Minister.\r\nAnd when Iyo no Kami came to our chief, he accepted the invitation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XXIX\r\n\r\n                  MASSACRE OF FRENCH SAILORS AT SAKAI\r\n\r\n\r\nUNFORTUNATELY just at this moment news was received that a boat-load of\r\nFrenchmen had been massacred by the Tosa troops at Sakai. This put an\r\nend to the conversation and to all hope of going to Kiôto for an\r\naudience. Two men were reported killed on the spot, seven missing, seven\r\nwounded, while five escaped unhurt. The account received by Daté just as\r\nhe left the French Legation was that only one had been killed. It was\r\nevident to everybody that the execution of the Bizen officer had not had\r\nthe effect of a warning. Confusion, despair; hopes dashed to the ground\r\njust on the point of fulfilment. No better accounts being given by Daté\r\nand Higashi-Kuzé on the following morning, and the missing sailors not\r\nhaving been given up, the Foreign Ministers resolved to withdraw their\r\nflags. When the two Japanese Ministers called on the French Minister to\r\nexpress their deep regret, he refused to see them, and addressed a\r\nletter to the Japanese authorities demanding the surrender of the\r\nmissing men by eight o'clock the following morning. The French, Italian,\r\nPrussian and American representatives embarked. We and the Dutch\r\npolitical agent remained on shore. But on the morning of the 10th the\r\nBritish flag was formally lowered, and Sir Harry went on board the\r\n\"Ocean,\" leaving Russell Robertson and myself at the vice-consulate,\r\nwith Lieutenant Bradshaw and six men of the 2/ix. The dead bodies of the\r\nseven missing French sailors having been found, Daté and Higashi-Kuzé\r\nwent on board the French flagship \"Vénus\" to inform M. Roches. But by\r\nsome curious blunder the boxes containing the corpses were sent first to\r\nthe British transport \"Adventure,\" where they were mistaken for cases of\r\n\"curios\" belonging to our Legation, and how the discovery was made of\r\nthe real nature of the contents I never heard, but they did not arrive\r\nat the French flagship till late in the afternoon. I saw Daté on his way\r\nback, who said he was greatly pleased with the moderation with which the\r\nFrench Minister was treating the affair. Next day Sir Harry landed, and\r\ncarried off Bradshaw and his men. He instructed me to call on Daté and\r\nsay to him that the Representatives would consult together after the\r\nfuneral as to the reparation to be demanded from the Mikado's\r\ngovernment, and that if they were unanimous the Japanese might feel\r\nassured that the demands were just. In that case the best thing they\r\ncould do would be to accept them without delay. On the other hand, if\r\nthe requirements of M. Roches exceeded the bounds of justice, the other\r\nministers would refuse to join him, and the Japanese Government could\r\nthen appeal to the French Government and those of the other Foreign\r\nPowers. In Sir Harry's own opinion a large number of the Tosa men ought\r\nto suffer death, but he did not approve of pecuniary indemnities. Having\r\ngiven me these instructions he went off to Hiôgo to attend the funeral\r\nof the murdered Frenchmen, eleven in all. Robertson and I called on Daté\r\nto deliver the chief's message, and after having executed our\r\ncommission, we went with Komatsu and Nakai to a Japanese restaurant and\r\nhad a feast in the usual style. We got home about seven o'clock, and as\r\nthe day was still young we took it into our heads to give ourselves an\r\nentertainment, and with a guide carrying a lantern went to the quarter\r\nof the town where such amusements are provided, to a house to which I\r\nknew that a foreigner had been introduced, and that by Tosa people. The\r\nmaster said he was afraid of his trade being injured if he received\r\nforeigners, but suggested our applying to the local authority for\r\npermission. While we were still in the shop a Tosa man came down from a\r\nroom upstairs, and on seeing us asked for his sword, but the people of\r\nthe house refused to give it, and led him away. It never entered my head\r\nthat the master of the house wished to get rid of us on account of his\r\nTosa guests. So we went to the municipal office, and came back again\r\nwith the desired permission, but the landlord was still not satisfied.\r\nWe were conversing with him when the same Tosa man came down sword in\r\nhand, and squatting down before us with a threatening air, demanded to\r\nknow who we were and what we were doing there. I replied that we were\r\nEnglish officers and was proceeding to explain what we wanted, but he\r\ninterrupted by fiercely questioning our right to be present. One of his\r\ncompanions roused by the disturbance came downstairs and carried him up\r\nagain, the women taking his sword and hiding it. The peaceful man then\r\ncame to us, and was offering an apology, when the madcap descended again\r\nwith a naked weapon in his hand, at least that was Robertson's\r\nimpression. His friend rushed to stop him; a struggle took place on the\r\nstairs and we bolted through the door into the street. The master of the\r\nhouse came out after us with our lantern, saying that our guide had\r\ndisappeared, and as he was not to be found, the old man had to escort us\r\nhome.\r\n\r\nMitford and Willis arrived back from Kiôto on the 12th, Sir Harry's\r\nletter giving permission for the latter to remain having crossed him on\r\nthe way. Having made arrangements for his going back again, we went on\r\nboard the \"Adventure\" to see the chief, and while we were there Daté and\r\nKomatsu arrived to tell him what the French Minister's demands were:\r\nnamely, 1st, the execution of all the men concerned in the massacre\r\n(about twenty Tosa men and twenty townspeople armed with fire-hooks,\r\nthey told us); 2nd, $150,000 for the families of the murdered men; 3rd,\r\napology of the principal minister for Foreign Affairs at Ozaka (this was\r\nYamashina no Miya, a Prince of the Blood); 4th, apology of the Tosa\r\n_daimiô_ Yamanouchi Tosa no Kami on board a French man-of-war at Susaki\r\n(the port of Tosa); 5th, the exclusion of all Tosa armed men from treaty\r\nports and cities. These had all been agreed to. We then returned ashore\r\nand started Willis on his way back to Kiôto.\r\n\r\nNext day we moved over to Hiôgo on board H.M.S. \"Adventure.\" All the\r\nForeign Representatives had addressed Notes to the Japanese Government\r\ncounselling them to comply with the French demands. Hasé Sammi, a Court\r\nNoble, arrived as an envoy from the Mikado to the French Minister\r\nbearing a message of condolence. He afterwards saw Sir Harry and\r\narranged with him that he should go to Kiôto for an audience of the\r\nMikado, as soon as this affair was disposed of. M. Roches had not fixed\r\nany date, but it was expected by the Japanese authorities that\r\neverything would be finished by the 16th. M. Roches seemed to be harping\r\non one string, that it would be regrettable if any single representative\r\nwent to Kiôto by himself, and Komatsu, who told us that he had expressed\r\nhimself to Hasé in that sense, thought that this was intended as a hit\r\nat Sir Harry. However, Polsbroek had also promised the Japanese that he\r\ntoo would go up to Kiôto as soon as satisfaction for the Tosa outrage\r\nwere afforded. Next day Daté arrived at six o'clock with Komatsu and\r\nwent on board the French flagship to deliver to Roches the Note\r\naccepting his demands. The 5th demand was understood to mean not merely\r\nthat no Tosa troops should garrison treaty ports and cities, but that no\r\nTosa _samurai_ of any class should be allowed at the treaty ports. This\r\nappeared to be too severe, and we held that it would have to be\r\nmodified. After he had finished with Roches, Daté came over to see Sir\r\nHarry and to tell him what had been arranged. Two officers and eighteen\r\nrank and file were to perform _harakiri_ at Sakai at two p.m. the next\r\nday, and Yamashina no Miya was simultaneously to call on Roches to\r\ndeliver the apology, and also invite him to Kiôto. On the day after that\r\nthe prince was to call on Sir Harry, at the same hour, on board H.M.S.\r\n\"Ocean\" at Kôbé. We were to leave Kôbé for Ozaka on the 19th, pass the\r\nnight of the 20th at Fushimi, and enter Kiôto the next day. On the 22nd\r\nwe were to receive visits, and have audience of the Emperor on the 23rd.\r\nThis was only a private and confidential arrangement with Daté, and\r\nwould only become official after Yamashina no Miya delivered the formal\r\ninvitation. In accordance with this programme the Prince, who was a\r\nfirst cousin once removed of the Mikado, and principal minister for\r\nForeign Affairs, came to Kôbé on the 18th to call on Sir Harry and\r\nPolsbroek. We learnt from him that Roches had begged off nine out of the\r\ntwenty condemned men, taking only one life for each of the murdered\r\nFrenchmen,[10] and that he had decided to go to Kiôto having heard from\r\nDaté that Sir Harry would accept the invitation. The Miya was dressed in\r\nthe same costume as the other court nobles we had seen, a purple silk\r\nrobe (_kari-ginu_) and a small black-lacquered wrinkled hat perched on\r\nthe top of the head. His age might be about fifty, and he wore a short\r\nbeard and moustache. His teeth bore marked signs of having been once\r\ndyed black. He was accompanied by Higashi-Kuzé, a son of the latter, and\r\nby Môri Heirokurô, son of Môri Awaji no Kami; this young man was to go\r\nto England with the son of Sanjô Sanéyoshi and young Nakamikado. It was\r\nexpected, they said, that the Mikado would move down to Ozaka about the\r\nend of the month, and remain there until Yedo was finished with. Keiki\r\nhad sent an apology through his relative Echizen, but it was not\r\nconsidered satisfactory, and military operations would be continued.\r\n\r\n\r\n    [10] This statement was not exact. The fact was, as we\r\n        learnt afterwards, that Captain du Petit Thouars, commanding\r\n        officer of the \"Dupleix\" to which ship the murdered sailors\r\n        belonged, who had been deputed by the French senior naval\r\n        officer to witness the execution with a party of his men,\r\n        finding that the completion of the proceedings would involve\r\n        the detention of his men on shore after dark, raised his\r\n        hand after the eleventh man had suffered. The nine whose\r\n        lives were spared were grievously hurt, we were afterwards\r\n        told, and no wonder, considering what the spirit of the\r\n        Japanese _samurai_ was. Patriotic death poems by the men who\r\n        suffered the extreme penalty were afterwards circulated\r\n        among the people. The following are prose translations of\r\n        some of these:\r\n\r\n        Though I regret not my body which becomes as dew scattered\r\n        by the wind, my country's fate weighs down my heart with\r\n        anxiety.\r\n\r\n        As I also am of the seed of the country of the gods, I\r\n        create for myself to-day a glorious subject for reflection\r\n        in the next world. The sacrifice of my life for the sake of\r\n        my country gives me a pure heart in my hour of death.\r\n\r\n        Unworthy as I am I have not wandered from the straight path\r\n        of the duty which a Japanese owes to his prince.\r\n\r\n        Though reproaches may be cast upon me, those who can fathom\r\n        the depths of a warrior's heart will appreciate my motives.\r\n\r\n        In this age, when the minds of men are darkened, I would\r\n        show the way to purity of heart.\r\n\r\n        In throwing away this life, so insignificant a possession, I\r\n        would desire to leave behind me an unsullied name.\r\n\r\n        The cherry flowers too have their seasons of blossoming and\r\n        fading. What is there for the Japanese soul to regret in\r\n        death?\r\n\r\n        Here I leave my soul and exhibit to the world the\r\n        intrepidity of a Japanese heart.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XXX\r\n\r\n                     KIOTO--AUDIENCE OF THE MIKADO\r\n\r\n\r\nON March 19 the whole legation crossed to Ozaka in H.M.S. \"Adventure.\" I\r\nleft my Japanese escort behind, as they would have been in the way at\r\nKiôto, and probably, being Tokugawa retainers, in fear of their lives\r\nthe whole time. Our party slept at the vice-consulate, and next day we\r\nrode up to Fushimi, escorted by Komatsu and a couple of Hizen officers,\r\none of whom named Nakamuta was the commander of the \"Eugénie,\" a steamer\r\nrecently acquired by Nabéshima. The party on horseback consisted of Sir\r\nHarry, Lieutenant Bradshaw and myself, with the legation mounted escort.\r\nWe went nearly the whole way at a foot's pace, the road being in fairly\r\ngood condition, but the bridges at Yodo having been burnt during the\r\nrecent fighting we had some difficulty in getting across the Kidzukawa,\r\nwhich falls into the river there. We got to Fushimi about six o'clock,\r\nand found comfortable quarters prepared for us in the guest rooms of a\r\nBuddhist monastery, where we were well looked after by some Hizen\r\nofficers. The rest of our party, together with the infantry guard of the\r\n2/ix, were to come up in boats, starting at three o'clock in the\r\nafternoon, and travelling through the night. They gradually reached\r\nFushimi next morning, and we managed to make a start about ten o'clock.\r\nThe first half of the way we were escorted by Hizen men, who were then\r\njoined by Owari troops, and here we were met by Gotô and our cheery\r\nlittle friend Nakai. The streets were crowded with spectators, who\r\nobserved perfect order. Chi-on-in, a very fine Buddhist monastery at the\r\nfoot of Higashi-yama, had been prepared for our accommodation, and\r\nguards were posted consisting of Higo, Awa and Owari troops. We found\r\nthe Owari officials who were in charge to attend to our comforts very\r\ndilatory people, and as yet quite unacquainted with foreigners and their\r\nrequirements. The apartments assigned to us were magnificently\r\ndecorated, altogether in the style of a feudal noble's palace, such as\r\nwe had seen at Tokushima the previous year. Shimadzu Osumi no Kami\r\n(father of the Prince of Satsuma) had occupied them for some time when\r\nhe first visited Kiôto. As soon as we settled in, a grand feast of many\r\ndishes in Japanese style was served up to us, but of course we had\r\nbrought our own cooks and utensils with us, for most of us were\r\nunaccustomed to Japanese food. Old Yôdô of Tosa, whom Willis had been\r\nattending, was reported to be out of danger and in a fair way of\r\nrecovery.\r\n\r\nThe 22nd March was spent by the chief in making a round of visits. It\r\ntook the Owari folk three hours to get us the necessary palanquins and\r\nbearers. We called first on Yamashina no Miya, who was very affable and\r\njolly, his dirty beard shaved off, and his teeth dyed black in correct\r\nstyle; he was dressed in the costume called _nôshi_, and wore the tiny\r\nblack lacquered hat as before. The conversation turned upon the\r\ndelightfulness of the occasion which had brought the British Minister to\r\nKiôto. Just after leaving the prince's residence we were stopped in the\r\nroad to let Ninnaji no Miya pass. He was on horseback, a stoutish,\r\nswarthy, thick-lipped young man, with his hair just beginning to sprout;\r\nfor until recently he had been in the Buddhist priesthood. Our next\r\nvisit was to Sanjô, who had had his title of Dainagon just restored to\r\nhim, a pale effeminate-looking undersized man of thirty-three years of\r\nage. He discoursed very formally on the happiness it gave to all the\r\nCourt people to see foreign ministers in Kiôto. From there we went\r\nthrough the enclosure known as the Nine Gates, past the Imperial Palace.\r\nIt was surrounded by a finely stuccoed wall four feet thick at the base,\r\nwith gates like those of a Buddhist temple, very neatly thatched with\r\nsmall shingles. Iwakura, whom we called on next, had his temporary\r\nresidence just inside and opposite the Kugé Mon gate on the west of the\r\npalace. He was a severe-looking oldish man, but frank in speech. He told\r\nthe chief it was true that the Mikado and Court Nobles had hated\r\nforeigners hitherto, and talked of \"barbarian-expelling\" (_jô-i_), while\r\nthe _Bakufu_ was all for \"opening the country.\" But now that was\r\ncompletely changed. They had specially to thank the English for having\r\nbeen the first to recognize the truth that the Mikado was the sovereign.\r\nItô told me that after we had left the house Iwakura expressed to him a\r\nfear that he might have given offence by speaking too frankly about the\r\nformer attitude of the Court towards foreigners. We then went to the\r\nHizen _yashiki_, and saw the prince, a young good-looking man of about\r\ntwenty-four years of age; he had been appointed to the department of\r\nForeign Affairs, but we would not discover that he had any great\r\naptitude for official work. Daté and Higashi-Kuzé luckily were not in\r\nwhen we called. We also visited the younger Chôshiû prince, Nagato no\r\nKami, whom we easily recognized by his likeness to the photograph taken\r\nwhen Admiral King was in Chôshiû. At the other houses we had been\r\naccommodated with chairs, but here we had to squat on the floor in\r\nJapanese fashion, and when we rose to leave it was with difficulty that\r\nwe could straighten our knee joints. We exchanged with him hearty\r\nexpressions of goodwill and congratulations on our ancient friendship.\r\nOn returning to Chi-on-in we found Daté and Gotô who had come to discuss\r\nthe details of the audience that was to take place on the morrow. They\r\nexpressed much anxiety lest the Mikado should find some difficulty in\r\nmaking his speech to the minister, as he had not up to the present ever\r\nspoken to any one but inmates of the Palace, and it was only ten days\r\nsince he had first shown his face to a _daimiô_. So we finally arranged\r\nthat His Majesty's speech should be written down, that he should try to\r\nrepeat it, and then hand the copy to Yamashina no Miya, who would read\r\nit out, and hand it to Itô for translation. The document was finally to\r\nremain in Sir Harry's possession. Then the latter would reply direct to\r\nthe Mikado through Itô acting as interpreter. The only member of the\r\nlegation staff to be admitted to the audience was Mitford, as he alone\r\nhad been presented at court in England. He was to be introduced by\r\nYamashina no Miya, and the Mikado would salute him with the word _kurô_,\r\nwhich might be freely rendered by \"Glad to see you.\" The _Shishinden_\r\nwhere the audience was to take place was, they told us, a large hall 28\r\nyards deep by 36 in length, with a floor of planking, with a dais and a\r\ncanopy for the Mikado, and another dais, rather lower, specially\r\narranged for the ministers. _Daimiôs_ who were received in audience had,\r\nwe were assured, to kneel on the bare planks. The three foreign\r\nrepresentatives, Roches, Sir Harry and Polsbroek were to assemble in one\r\nroom, and be thence conducted into the presence of the Mikado.\r\n\r\nIt was now our turn to suffer an assault at the hands of the fanatics of\r\npatriotism, from which our constant advocacy of the rights of the\r\nsovereign afforded us no protection.\r\n\r\nIt was arranged that we should start from Chi-on-in for the palace at\r\none o'clock on March 23. The procession was to be headed by the mounted\r\nescort, led by Inspector Peacock and Nakai, then Sir Harry and Gotô,\r\nmyself and Lieutenant Bradshaw, the detachment of the 2/ix, followed by\r\nWillis, J. J. Enslie, Mitford in a palanquin (being unable to ride) and\r\nfive naval officers who had come up with us. We descended the whole\r\nlength of the street called Nawaté opposite to the main gate of\r\nChi-on-in, but just as the last file of the mounted escort turned the\r\ncorner to the right, a couple of men sprang out from opposite sides of\r\nthe street, drew their swords, and attacked the men and horses, running\r\ndown the line and hacking wildly. Nakai observing what was passing\r\njumped down from his pony and engaged the fellow on the right, with whom\r\nhe had a pretty tough fight. In the struggle his feet got entangled in\r\nhis long loose trousers, and he fell on his back. His enemy tried to cut\r\noff his head, but Nakai parried the blow, receiving only a scalp wound,\r\nand pierced the man's breast with the point of his sword at the same\r\ntime. This sickened him, and as he was turning his back on Nakai he\r\nreceived a blow on the shoulder from Gotô's sword, which prostrated him\r\non the ground, and Nakai jumping up hacked off his head. In the\r\nmeanwhile the troopers on the left had turned, and some of them pursued\r\nthe other villain, who rushed down the street from which Sir Harry and I\r\nhad not yet emerged. I had only just arrived at a comprehension of what\r\nwas taking place; my presence of mind had deserted me, and as he passed\r\nmy sole idea of defence was to turn my pony's head round to ward off the\r\nblow aimed at me. It was a narrow escape, as I afterwards found, for the\r\nanimal received a slight cut on the nose, and was also wounded on the\r\nshoulder an inch of two in front of my knee. As soon as I recovered my\r\nequanimity I moved up to the head of the procession. There I saw Sir\r\nHarry Parkes, in his brilliant uniform of an Envoy and Minister calmly\r\nsitting on his horse in the middle of the cross-roads, with Inspector\r\nPeacock close by, also on horseback, and a crowd of Japanese spectators.\r\nThe Japanese infantry, 300 men of Higo, who had led our procession had\r\ndisappeared, as had also those who had originally brought up the rear.\r\nBut our Japanese grooms stuck to us with the greatest cool pluck. Behind\r\nme was the infantry guard of the 2/ix, facing to the left. Upon them he\r\nhurled himself, cutting one man over the head and inflicting a severe\r\nwound, but here his career came to an end, for one of the soldiers put\r\nout his foot and tripped him up, and others drove their bayonets into\r\nhim. Nevertheless he managed to get to the end of the line, where being\r\nstopped by Mitford's palanquin, he fled into the courtyard of a house,\r\ndropping his sword outside. Here he was found by Bradshaw, who\r\ndischarged a pistol at his head, but the bullet struck the joint of the\r\nlower jaw, and did not penetrate the bone. On this he fell down in the\r\nyard, and became nearly insensible. Our wounded were too numerous to\r\nadmit of our proceeding to court. Nine of our escort were wounded, and\r\none of the 2/ix guard, besides Nakai and Sir Harry's Japanese groom. We\r\ntherefore procured bearers for the palanquins which had been abandoned\r\nby their frightened porters, and returned to our quarters without any\r\nfurther mishap. When the wounds were examined it was found that none\r\nwere in a vital part, though there had been much loss of blood. A cut\r\ninto the knee of one man, and the almost complete severance of the wrist\r\nof another were the worst cases. It was a great piece of good fortune\r\nthat we had such an experienced surgeon as Willis with us. The captured\r\nassailant appeared to be a Buddhist priest, at least his head was\r\nshaven. Assisted by a retainer of Sanjô's we examined him. He expressed\r\ngreat penitence, and asked that his head might be cut off and exposed\r\npublicly to inform the Japanese nation of his crime. His wounds were\r\nattended to by Willis, and he was carefully deposited in the guard-room.\r\nNakai brought the head of the other man back with him, and kept it by\r\nhis side in a bucket as a trophy; it was a ghastly sight; on the left\r\nside of the skull a terrible triangular wound exposed the brain, and\r\nthere was a cut on the right jaw which apparently had been dealt by the\r\nsword of one of the escort.\r\n\r\nMy diary contains no further entry until the middle of May, and letters\r\nI wrote to my parents narrating the incidents which befel us at Kiôto\r\nhave not been preserved. A very full account of this affair, written by\r\nMitford to his father, was communicated to the \"Times,\" and the despatch\r\nof March 25 in which the chief reported the whole affair was included in\r\na volume of \"confidential print\" and has not been published. See also\r\n\"Memories\" by Lord Redesdale, ii. 449. A briefer narrative based on\r\nofficial documents is to be found in vol. II of \"The History of Japan\"\r\nby F. O. Adams. As long as we remained at Kiôto I was so busy with\r\ninterpreting between the chief and Japanese high functionaries and in\r\ntranslating documents that my journal had to be neglected, and my memory\r\nof what occurred over fifty years ago, left unrecorded at the time, is\r\nscarcely full enough to afford material for completing this chapter\r\nunaided.\r\n\r\nIt will readily be comprehended that this fanatical attack on the\r\nBritish Minister, who had proved himself a cordial friend of the\r\nimperialist party, caused a feeling of utmost consternation at the Court\r\nas soon as the news was received there about four o'clock in the\r\nafternoon. The French Minister and the Dutch Political Agent had\r\npunctually reached the Palace, where they were kept waiting for the\r\narrival of their colleague. As he failed to make his appearance their\r\nreception was hurried through, and on leaving the audience chamber they\r\nreceived the notes Sir Harry had sent off informing them of what had\r\nhappened. About six o'clock in the evening there came to him straight\r\nfrom the court Tokudaiji, Echizen Saishô, Higashi-Kuzé, Daté and the\r\nPrince of Hizen to express the deep regret of the Mikado. The minister\r\nreplied that he would leave the matter in the hands of the Mikado's\r\ngovernment. He considered that a graver outrage had been committed upon\r\nthe Mikado than upon himself, and he felt assured that the government\r\nwould know how to vindicate the honour of their sovereign. They\r\nmanifested a degree of feeling and concern which showed that\r\nremonstrance from him was not needed to make them sensible of the\r\ngravity of the offence. They reproached themselves for not having taken\r\nbetter precautions for his safety, and deplored the disgrace attaching\r\nto themselves for an outrage committed on a foreign representative\r\nspecially invited by the Mikado to Kiôto. He added that of course their\r\napologies would take a written form, but he recurred to arguments he had\r\npreviously addressed to various members of the government as to the\r\nnecessity of an enactment which should attach the penalty of an\r\nignominious death to all _samurai_ who committed murderous attacks on\r\nforeigners instead of allowing them to die with credit by their own\r\nhand; as in the case of the eleven men who were executed for the murder\r\nof the French seamen at Sakai. He urged also that the Mikado's\r\ngovernment should make known by public proclamation that His Majesty\r\nreally desired to cultivate friendly relations with foreign powers. It\r\nwas their duty to eradicate the spirit of hostility towards foreigners\r\nto which so many had fallen victims, and which was fostered by the\r\nerroneous idea entertained by a certain class that in attacking\r\nforeigners they were doing the Mikado good service. Accordingly the\r\nwritten apology was delivered next day, together with a copy of the\r\nsentence depriving the prisoner of his rank as _samurai_, and passing a\r\nsentence of decapitation on him. Sanjô, Iwakura, Tokudaiji, Higashi-Kuzé\r\nand other ministers called to offer their regrets, and promised that the\r\nproclamation should be posted on the public notice-boards which were a\r\nfeature in every town and village. They offered also in case any of our\r\nwounded should die, or be deprived of their livelihood by inability to\r\nperform their duties, to provide suitable compensation.\r\n\r\nThis affair having been satisfactorily disposed of, the chief agreed to\r\nhave an audience of the Mikado, which took place on March 26th. Of\r\ncourse we were not able to make such a show as on the 23rd, since most\r\nof the mounted escort were incapacitated by the severity of their\r\nwounds. On the other hand extraordinary precautions were taken for the\r\nsecurity of the party in passing along the streets. As had previously\r\nbeen arranged, of the legation staff only Mitford was presented. The\r\nminister and he ascended the Shishinden by steps at the north end,\r\nentered by the door on the south, and issuing from it after the audience\r\ndescended by steps at the south end. Those of us, like Willis and\r\nmyself, and the other members of our party walked through the courtyard\r\npast the hall of audience, and rejoined them as they came down again.\r\nThe Mikado was the first to speak, and his speech ran as follows:--\r\n\r\n    I hope your sovereign enjoys good health. I trust that the\r\n    intercourse between our respective countries will become more\r\n    and more friendly, and be permanently established. I regret\r\n    deeply that an unfortunate affair which took place as you were\r\n    proceeding to the palace on the 23rd instant has delayed this\r\n    ceremony. It gives me great pleasure therefore to see you here\r\n    to-day.\r\n\r\nTo this the minister made the following reply:--\r\n\r\n    Sire,\r\n\r\n    Her Majesty the Queen is in the enjoyment of good health. I\r\n    shall have great pleasure in reporting to my government Your\r\n    Majesty's inquiries and assurances of friendship. The condition\r\n    of the foreign relations of a state must ever be dependent upon\r\n    its internal stability and progress, and Your Majesty is taking\r\n    the best measures to place the foreign relations of Japan upon a\r\n    permanent footing by establishing a strong general government\r\n    throughout Your Majesty's dominions, and by adopting the system\r\n    of international law universally recognized by other states. I\r\n    am deeply sensible of the manner in which Your Majesty has been\r\n    pleased to notice the attack made upon me on the 23rd instant,\r\n    and I appreciate the exertions of Your Majesty's ministers on\r\n    that unfortunate occasion. The memory of it will be effaced by\r\n    the gracious reception which Your Majesty has given me this day.\r\n\r\nThe foreign representatives left Kiôto the following day. Saegusa\r\nShigéru, the captive of our bow and spear on the 23rd, was executed that\r\nmorning. Three supposed accomplices before the fact were sentenced to\r\nperpetual exile, but we were never convinced of their guilt. If it had\r\nbeen proved against them they ought to have suffered the same penalty,\r\nbut the chief did not care to press the point.\r\n\r\nIt was Sir Harry's wish that I should remain at Ozaka to keep up\r\ncommunication with the court, but I persuaded him to leave Mitford there\r\nfor the purpose. Two motives actuated me. I wished to get back to my\r\nnewly acquired house at Yedo, and Mitford knew much more than I did\r\nabout English parliamentary institutions, which was a subject in which\r\nthe leaders of the _samurai_ class at Kiôto, and especially Gotô\r\nShôjirô, were greatly interested. For their hope was to base the new\r\ngovernment of Japan on a representative system.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XXXI\r\n\r\n           RETURN TO YEDO AND PRESENTATION OF THE MINISTER'S\r\n                        NEW CREDENTIALS AT OZAKA\r\n\r\n\r\nON March 31 I arrived back at Yokohama with the chief, and went up to\r\nYedo on April 1 to find out what was the state of things there. I took\r\nNoguchi and my six Japanese escort men with me. The latter were lodged\r\nin a building by the gate of my house. My chief source of information\r\nwas Katsu Awa no Kami who had been the head of the Tokugawa navy. To\r\navoid exciting attention I used to visit him after dark. The van of the\r\nimperialist army had already arrived in the neighbourhood of Yedo, the\r\nadvanced posts being at Shinagawa, Shinjiku and Itabashi. Slight\r\nskirmishes with detached bodies of disbanded Yedo troops had taken place\r\non the Kôshiû and Kisô roads, which had delayed the arrival of the\r\nimperial forces for a day or two. Small parties of Satsuma and Chôshiû\r\nmen wandered about the streets of the city unmolested, and a smaller\r\nSatsuma _yashiki_, near our legation, was re-occupied on March 7 by a\r\nfew soldiers of that clan. Arisugawa no Miya, the commander-in-chief,\r\nwas reported to be still at Numadzu, half a day's journey west of the\r\ntop of the Hakoné pass. Keiki was residing in retirement at the Tokugawa\r\nmausoleum of Uyéno, straining every effort to keep his retainers in a\r\nsubmissive temper towards the Mikado, by means of notifications to the\r\npeople and a body of armed police. Already as early as March 4 a\r\nproclamation had been issued declaring that the ex-Shôgun was determined\r\nto submit to any orders which might be given to him by the Mikado, and\r\nthat no opposition was to be offered to the imperial troops. Aidzu and\r\nhis clansmen had retired to their home at Wakamatsu in Oshiû, after\r\ndismantling all the clan establishments in Yedo. Nearly all the other\r\n_daimiôs_ who had been residing in Yedo until recently had either\r\nreturned to their territories or gone to Kiôto to give in their\r\nallegiance to the Mikado. The _hatamoto_, or retainers of Tokugawa below\r\nthe rank of _daimiô_ were daily following their example. The people of\r\nthe city, ignorant of the demands about to be made on Keiki, and mindful\r\nof the misfortunes some of them had experienced when the Satsuma\r\n_yashiki_ were attacked in the previous December, were apprehensive of a\r\ngeneral conflagration. Some had removed their household property, but\r\nthe shops were still open, and the panic was by no means general. The\r\nforts in the bay of Yedo were handed over to the imperialists on April\r\n4, after the guns bearing on the city had been dismounted. This was the\r\nnews on the 8th. On the 12th I went up again for a three days' stay, and\r\nfound the city much quieter, owing to a feeling that the terms offered\r\nto Keiki would be such as he could accept. Katsu, who was now\r\ncommander-in-chief of the Tokugawa forces, told me that he and Okubo\r\nIchiô had charge of the negotiations. On the other side Saigô\r\nrepresented Arisugawa no Miya, the imperialist commander-in-chief who\r\nwas still at Sumpu. The demands made on Keiki were that he should\r\nsurrender all arms and munitions of war, all vessels of war and other\r\nsteamers, evacuate the castle of Yedo, and execute those of his officers\r\nwho had been foremost in prompting and conducting the attack on Fushimi;\r\nwhen these demands were complied with the Mikado would show clemency\r\ntowards the ex-Shôgun. The nature of the further conditions covered by\r\nthe word \"clemency\" was the subject of negotiations between Katsu and\r\nSaigô, which took place at a house in Shinagawa. Katsu was willing to\r\nagree to any arrangement that would save the life of his chief and\r\nsecure sufficient revenue to support his large body of retainers. He had\r\nhinted to Saigô that less favourable terms would be met by armed\r\nresistance. Keiki also desired to retain possession of his steamers and\r\nmunitions of war, and had addressed a petition to the Mikado on this\r\nsubject. Saigô, carrying this petition and Katsu's verbal proposals, had\r\nreturned to Sumpu to lay them before Arisugawa. From there he had\r\njourneyed to Kiôto, but was expected back on the 18th. Katsu said he was\r\nready to fight in defence of Keiki's life, and expressed his confidence\r\nin Saigô's ability to prevent a demand being made which might not only\r\nbe a disgrace to the Mikado, but prolong the civil war. He begged that\r\nSir Harry Parkes would use his influence with the Mikado's government to\r\nobviate such a disaster. This the chief did repeatedly, and in\r\nparticular when Saigô called on him at Yokohama on April 28, he urged on\r\nhim that severity towards Keiki or his supporters, especially in the way\r\nof personal punishment, would injure the reputation of the new\r\ngovernment in the opinion of European Powers. Saigô said the life of the\r\nex-Shôgun would not be demanded, and he hoped that similar leniency\r\nwould be extended to those who had instigated him to march against\r\nKiôto. Keiki was still at the monastery at Uyéno, but some of his late\r\nadvisers, whom he had ordered into strict seclusion (_kin-shin_) had\r\nsecretly fled. Amongst these Katsu mentioned Ogasawara, late chief\r\nminister for Foreign Affairs, Hirayama, whom we used to call \"the old\r\nfox,\" Tsukahara, an official whom we greatly liked, and Oguri Kôdzuké no\r\nSuké, a finance minister. The most remarkable statement Katsu made to me\r\nwas that at a conference between the ex-Shôgun's ministers and M. Roches\r\nin February the latter strongly urged resistance, and that the officers\r\nof the French Military Mission were persistent in advising the\r\nfortification of the Hakoné pass and other measures of a warlike nature.\r\nOn the whole Katsu was of opinion that he and Okubo Ichiô would be able\r\nto arrange satisfactory terms, if they could manage to escape the\r\nhot-heads of their own party who were threatening their lives.\r\n\r\nBy this time the first division of the imperialist naval force had\r\narrived to co-operate with the army which had advanced by land. There\r\nseemed to be little likelihood of fighting, but even a peaceable\r\nsettlement would be disadvantageous to the prosperity of the city. Now\r\nthat the _daimiôs_ whose wants had been supplied by the merchants and\r\nshopkeepers had left for their country homes, the population would\r\nnaturally decrease. It was a sad thing that Yedo should decline, for it\r\nwas one of the handsomest cities in the Far East. Though it contained no\r\nfine public buildings, its position on the seashore, fringed with the\r\npleasure gardens of the _daimiôs_, and the remarkable huge moats\r\nsurrounding the castle, crowned with cyclopean walls and shaded by\r\npicturesque lines of pine-tree, the numerous rural spots in the city\r\nitself, all contributed to produce an impression of greatness. It\r\ncovered a huge extent of ground, owing to the size of the castle, and\r\nthe large number of official residences, intersected by fine broad\r\nwell-gravelled streets. The commercial quarter was actually smaller than\r\nthe city of Ozaka.\r\n\r\nNewspapers, to a large extent in the nature of gazettes, had lately been\r\nstarted in Kiôto and Yedo, and contained a great number of interesting\r\npolitical documents, which I had to translate for the information of my\r\nchief. Previously we had been obliged to rely on such manuscript copies\r\nas we could obtain from our friends in _daimiôs' yashikis_, and the\r\nsupply was limited. Nor were the papers that came into our hands\r\naltogether trustworthy. There was as much forgery of memorials,\r\nmanifestoes and correspondence as in any other part of the world in a\r\ntime of political excitement. There were rumours about this time that\r\nthe capital would be transferred from Kiôto to Ozaka, an arrangement we\r\nfelt inclined to welcome, for it would have been very inconvenient to\r\nestablish the foreign legations at Kiôto, so far inland and away from\r\nour sources of supply, subject to great cold in winter and excessive\r\nheat in summer. Even at Ozaka, close to the sea, the climate was almost\r\nunbearable in July and August. But as everyone knows, Yedo was after all\r\nconstituted the centre of government, and its name changed to Tôkiô.\r\n\r\nDuring this period my time was passed half at Yedo gathering information\r\nand half at Yokohama making translations and drawing up reports. Bread\r\nand beef were unprocurable at Yedo, and I could not afford to set up a\r\ncuisine in European fashion, so while there I used to have my food\r\nbrought in from a well-reputed Japanese restaurant close by, and came to\r\nlike it quite as well as what I had been accustomed to all my life.\r\n\r\nAs early as the end of November 1867 Sir Harry had applied to Lord\r\nStanley for letters of credence to the Mikado. No time was wasted in\r\ntheir preparation and despatch, and they reached him at the end of March\r\n1868, but it was not till the middle of May that things had quieted down\r\nat Yokohama sufficiently to allow of his leaving that part of the\r\ncountry. By that time Sidney Locock and his family had left for home,\r\nand his successor Francis Ottiwell Adams had arrived. We started from\r\nYokohama in the Admiral's yacht \"Salamis\" on May 15, Sir Harry, Adams,\r\nJ. J. Quin the senior student interpreter, and myself. Next afternoon we\r\nanchored in the harbour of Oshima, between the island of that name and\r\nthe southernmost point of the province of Kii. On a neck of land there\r\nwas a small village, very dirty, stinking and labyrinthine, surrounded\r\nby prettily wooded hills, where we started several pheasants in the\r\ncourse of a walk. At dusk we weighed anchor, and reached Hiôgo at nine\r\no'clock the next morning, where we found H.M.S. \"Ocean\" and \"Zebra\"\r\nalready in harbour. We had passed H.M.S. \"Rodney,\" the flagship of\r\nAdmiral Sir Harry Keppel, on the way up the Kii channel. These ships\r\nwere assembled off Ozaka to give _éclat_ to the presentation of the\r\nfirst letter of an European sovereign to the rightful sovereign of\r\nJapan. We got to the Ozaka bar about noon, and afterwards Adams, Quin\r\nand I went ashore with the baggage. The chief did not land until the\r\n18th, when a salute was fired from the fort in his honour. We then\r\nbecame busily occupied with the arrangements for the presentation of the\r\nminister's credentials, of his staff and a large number of naval\r\nofficers. We took up our quarters at the vice-consulate for the sake of\r\nconvenience in communicating with the squadron outside the bar. The 22nd\r\nwas fixed on as the day for the ceremony. Then the credentials had to be\r\ntranslated into Japanese, and the number of officers to be presented had\r\nto be agreed upon. I had to be present, much to my annoyance, for I\r\npossessed no diplomatic uniform. The chief offered me the loan of a sort\r\nof staff jacket of blue serge fastened in front with frogs, and an old\r\npair of trousers with gold lace down the sides, but I put them away in a\r\ncupboard and went to Court in plain evening dress. As soon as Sir Harry\r\nlanded he was visited by Gotô, one of the two _samurai_ who had fought\r\nin our defence at Kiôto on the 23rd March, and by Daté. With the latter\r\nwe had a discussion about the recently published edict against\r\nChristianity; it revived the ancient prohibition, but in less stringent\r\nterms. Daté admitted that the wording was objectionable, and said that\r\nhe had caused it not to be exhibited on the public notice-boards at\r\nOzaka and Hiôgo. He had tried to get the expression (translated \"evil\"\r\nor \"pernicious\" sect) altered, but said it would be impossible to\r\nsuppress the proscription of Christianity altogether. Sir Harry\r\nresponded that religious toleration was a mark of civilization, and to\r\nus he said privately that the presentation of the Queen's letter was a\r\ngood opportunity which we ought to turn to account. Afterwards I had a\r\nlong talk with Nakai on this subject, and suggested that instead of\r\nspecifically mentioning Christianity the decree should merely forbid\r\n\"pernicious sects\" in general. It was clear that the Japanese Government\r\nwould not be induced to revoke the law completely, for that would be to\r\ngive a free hand to the Roman Catholic missionaries at Nagasaki, who had\r\nalready made themselves obnoxious by the active manner in which they had\r\ncarried on their proselytism. It was however agreed that Sir Harry\r\nshould meet Sanjô, Daté, Gotô and Kido on the following day to dispose,\r\nif possible, of this question, but Nakai warned me that not even the\r\nheads of the government (_sôsai_) could make a definite promise; they\r\nwere not absolute, as he said. So on the 19th we had a palaver at the\r\nNishi Hongwanji, at which Yamashina no Miya, the president of the\r\nForeign Board, was present, besides those already mentioned, and several\r\nmore. They defended what had been done on the ground that the hostility\r\nto Christianity was still intense, and that in popular opinion it was\r\nallied to magic or sorcery. This I knew myself to be a fact. I had once\r\nbeen asked by a Japanese to teach him \"Kiristan,\" which he believed\r\nwould enable him to discover what his wife was doing in his absence from\r\nthe house. They admitted however that an error had been committed in\r\ndescribing Christianity as a pernicious sect, and said that this wording\r\nwould be altered. To have published nothing would have been tantamount\r\nto toleration, \"silent approval\" as the Japanese expression goes, and\r\nupon this they could not venture. On the 24th Sir Harry recurred to the\r\nsubject with the same set of ministers, with whom Iwakura was joined.\r\nPerhaps it was on this occasion that a young _samurai_ of Hizen, Okuma\r\nHachitarô, whom we had not met before, assured us that he knew all about\r\nthe subject, for he had read the Bible and the \"Prairie-book.\" It\r\nappeared that he had been a pupil of Dr Verbeck, an American missionary\r\nat Nagasaki. Sir Harry gave them a copy and a Japanese version of a\r\ndespatch on this subject, which had been received from Lord Stanley. The\r\nother foreign diplomats took the same line, but their united\r\nremonstrances produced little effect, and the measure of exiling to\r\nother parts of the country some four thousand Japanese of all ages and\r\nboth sexes mostly from the village of Urakami near Nagasaki, was\r\nunflinchingly carried out.\r\n\r\nThe presentation of the minister's letters of credence took place on the\r\n22nd. Admiral Keppel landed in the morning accompanied by his\r\nflag-Captain Heneage, and Captain Stanhope of the \"Ocean\"; Commander\r\nPollard and Lieutenant Kerr in command of a gunboat; Pusey, commander of\r\nthe \"Salamis\"; his secretary William Risk, and Garnier, flag-lieutenant,\r\nand joined us at the vice-consulate. The legation party included the\r\nchief, Adams, Mitford, who had just been gazetted second secretary, and\r\nmyself. Our procession consisted of a hundred marines from H.M.S.\r\n\"Rodney\" and the same number from H.M.S. \"Ocean,\" twelve palanquins in\r\nwhich such of us rode as had legs flexible enough, four of the legation\r\nescort on foot, and two bodies of Japanese troops who preceded and\r\nfollowed us. We arrived punctually at one o'clock at the Nishi\r\nHongwanji, assigned for the performance of the ceremony. The theory of\r\nthe Mikado's presence at Ozaka was that he was at the head of the army\r\noperating from Kiôto against the rebellious Tokugawa chief at Yedo, and\r\nhe was therefore obliged to put up with such accommodation as he could\r\nfind in the Buddhist monasteries, which were not very imperial in their\r\nappointments. We were ushered into an ante-chamber which was merely a\r\npart of the hall of audience divided off by screens. Down the middle ran\r\na long table covered with cloth of gold, about the only piece of\r\nsplendour in the place; on one side of this we took our seats, the\r\nJapanese ministers for Foreign Affairs on the other. Tea, and sweetmeats\r\npiled on wooden trays were brought in for our refection, and we had to\r\nwait about half-an-hour before the chief of the ministry entered the\r\nroom and made the polite speeches necessary on such an occasion. In a\r\nfew minutes more we were informed that everything was ready, whereupon\r\nthe second and third ministers proceeded to usher us into the throne\r\nroom. This was an apartment of considerable size down each side of which\r\nthere ran a row of wooden pillars supporting the roof. On a dais at the\r\nextreme end sat the Mikado, under a canopy supported by black-lacquered\r\npoles, and with the blinds rolled up as high as was possible. We\r\nadvanced up the middle of the room in double column, the one on the\r\nright headed by the Admiral and composed of naval officers, the other\r\nheaded by the minister, and consisting of the legation staff. Everyone\r\nmade three bows, first on advancing into the middle of the room, the\r\nsecond at the foot of the dais, the third on mounting the dais, which\r\nwas large enough to afford place for us all. The Mikado rose and stood\r\nunder the canopy from the moment that we began to bow. The principal\r\nminister for Foreign Affairs and one other great personage knelt, one on\r\neach side of the throne.\r\n\r\nIn front of the throne, on each side, stood a small wooden image of a\r\nlion; these are of great antiquity and are much revered by the Japanese\r\npeople. Behind the throne a crowd of courtiers were ranged in a double\r\nrow, wearing little black paper caps and gorgeous brocade robes of\r\nvarious hues. As the Mikado stood up, the upper part of his face,\r\nincluding the eyes, became hidden from view, but I saw the whole of it\r\nwhenever he moved. His complexion was white, perhaps artificially so\r\nrendered, his mouth badly formed, what a doctor would call prognathous,\r\nbut the general contour was good. His eyebrows were shaven off, and\r\npainted in an inch higher up. His costume consisted of a long black\r\nloose cape hanging backwards, a white upper garment or mantle and\r\nvoluminous purple trousers. The proceedings were as follows: the\r\nminister stood in front of the Mikado's right, with the Legation behind\r\nhim in order of seniority, the Admiral with his personal staff and the\r\nother naval officers on the imperial left. Sir Harry then recited his\r\naddress, which he had got by heart; it seemed truly absurd when one at\r\nlast stood face to face with the recipient. Then Itô, who discharged the\r\nfunctions of interpreter on the occasion, read the translation, and we\r\nall bowed. Sir Harry stepping forward put the Queen's letter into the\r\nhand of the Mikado, who evidently felt bashful or timid, and had to be\r\nassisted by Yamashina no Miya; his part was to receive it from the\r\nMikado. Then His Majesty forgot his speech, but catching a word from the\r\npersonage on his left managed to get out the first sentence, whereupon\r\nItô read out the translation of the whole that had been prepared\r\nbeforehand. Sir Harry then introduced each of us in turn, and next the\r\nAdmiral, who presented his officers. The Mikado expressed the hope that\r\nall was well with the squadron under his command, and we retired\r\nbackwards out of the presence into the ante-chamber, bowing as we went,\r\nand congratulating ourselves that everything had passed off without a\r\nhitch. In the evening we went to dine with Daté, who gave us a banquet\r\ncooked as nearly in European fashion as he could manage. Next day we\r\ncelebrated the Queen's birthday in advance by firing salutes, and a\r\nlarge party of Japanese nobles went on board the \"Rodney\" to lunch with\r\nthe Admiral. Yamashina no Miya proposed the Queen's health, which was\r\nresponded to enthusiastically by everyone present. Many of the guests\r\nwere intelligent and well behaved, but the Prince of Chôshiû, who\r\ninsisted on my sitting next to him, behaved like a great baby, and drank\r\nmore champagne than was good for him. One felt however that Japanese\r\nprinces could not be blamed if they were weak-minded, their education\r\nbeing planned so as to produce that result. The son of the Mikado's\r\nmaternal uncle was possessed with a huge desire to see an European cat,\r\nwhile another great man wanted to get sight of a negro, and we had great\r\ndifficulty in satisfying their wishes. The principal minister for\r\nForeign Affairs, who had of course to be saluted, desired that as little\r\npowder as possible should be used, because the sound of a violent\r\nexplosion hurt his ears. One of the great attractions was the \"Rodney's\"\r\nband, which played a great deal of noisy music for the benefit of the\r\nAdmiral's guests, and the bandmaster of the \"Ocean\" gained great\r\napplause by composing a march and a Japanese national anthem, which he\r\ndedicated to the Mikado. The conference held at Ozaka on the following\r\nday (a Sunday), at which among other things the Christian question was\r\ndiscussed, lasted for six hours, and that meant six hours for me of\r\ninterpreting from English into Japanese and from Japanese into English.\r\nSo it was a certain amount of relief to me when on the 25th we\r\nreembarked on board the \"Salamis\" to return to Yokohama. The Mikado left\r\nOzaka on the 28th and returned to Kiôto, the submission of the ex-Tycoon\r\nbeing held to justify this step.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XXXII\r\n\r\n                 MISCELLANEOUS INCIDENTS--MITO POLITICS\r\n\r\n\r\nADAMS and I set up housekeeping together in the First Secretary's house\r\nat Yokohama, but I still kept on the Japanese _yashiki_ I had rented at\r\nYedo, and spent a great deal of time there watching the course of\r\nevents. From time to time I returned to Yokohama to report to my chief,\r\nor else reported to him by letter. I was very busily occupied in making\r\ntranslations from the official gazette that was now being published at\r\nKiôto and the popular newspapers that had started into existence at\r\nYedo. One of these contained documents of the highest interest, the\r\nterms communicated to Keiki on April 27, the acceptance of which by him\r\ninvolved his retirement to Mito on May 8, and the provisional\r\nrecognition of Kaménosuké (Tayasu) as the head of the Tokugawa clan. The\r\ncastle of Yedo was occupied by the imperialist forces, and the troops of\r\nSatsuma, Chôshiû and other clans moved freely about the city. On June 23\r\nI went up to Yedo for a three days' stay with Adams; I found there in\r\nthe local papers interesting communications which were probably\r\nfictitious. Thus one, said to be written by a retainer of the Miya of\r\nChi-on-in, where the British Legation had been lodged in March, who\r\nthough regarding the expulsion of foreigners as perhaps difficult of\r\nachievement, recommended that the organization of the army be diligently\r\ntaken in hand, in order that foreigners might be humbled and kept in\r\nsubjection. He also deprecated audiences being granted by the Mikado to\r\nforeign diplomatic representatives. Another such paper professed to\r\nrepresent the views of Chôshiû \"irregular troops\" and protested against\r\naudiences being granted, because such friendly treatment of foreigners\r\nwould prevent the nation from affording hearty support to the Mikado\r\nwhen the time should arrive for \"expelling the barbarian.\" When I\r\nmentioned these publications to my friend Katsu, he replied that a\r\ncouncil of court and territorial nobles (_kugé_ and _daimiôs_) was held\r\nat Kiôto about the end of May, at which the former expressed the opinion\r\nthat a favourable occasion for expelling foreigners from the country had\r\nnow presented itself; their attempt to introduce Christianity at\r\nNagasaki might be alleged as the justifying ground of the measure. That\r\nthe _daimiôs_ were silent and that the Mikado, on being referred to,\r\ntook no notice of the proposal. Katsu was not very accurately informed,\r\nbut it is a fact that on May 14 the principal members of the government\r\nand _daimiôs_ in attendance on the Mikado at Ozaka were summoned before\r\nHis Majesty at the Hongwanji, and were informed that Christianity was on\r\nthe increase at Urakami, a village near Nagasaki; he asked for their\r\nopinion as to the best way of dealing with the matter, and it was\r\nunderstood that their replies would be published in the government\r\ngazette. Daté denied to Mitford that part of the story which said that\r\nthe meeting was for the purpose of considering whether an anti-foreign\r\npolicy might not be resorted to. It was difficult for us to obtain\r\naccurate information, and probably every Japanese in the position of\r\nKatsu or Daté experienced similar difficulty. I do not think however\r\nthat these documents ever saw the light, and the suggestion is very\r\nnatural that some of them were of such a character that it was\r\nconsidered advisable to suppress them. The formal appointment of\r\nKaménosuké, a mere boy of six years of age, took place on June 19, and\r\nthe leading men of the Tokugawa clan waited on him the following morning\r\nto present their felicitations. The situation and extent of the\r\nterritory to be left to the clan had not then been determined. Katsu\r\ntold me that Sanjô, who had arrived in Yedo on the 13th, was waiting for\r\nthe reinforcements expected from the south and west before announcing a\r\ndecision on these points. He gave me such statistics about the revenue\r\nhitherto accruing to the Tycoon's government as showed, to his\r\nsatisfaction at least, that it would not be possible for the Mikado to\r\nderive any income from forfeiture of that revenue, and there was danger\r\nof his government falling to pieces for want of funds. Higashi-Kuzé, who\r\nwas then in Yedo, said to me that the revenue to be granted to the\r\nTokugawa would not be fixed until that part of the clan still in arms\r\nagainst the Mikado was entirely reduced to submission. The war was being\r\nvigorously prosecuted near Niigata in Echigo and in the neighbourhood of\r\nAidzu. I myself saw a considerable body of southern troops march into\r\nYedo on June 25, which effectually contradicted the hopes of the\r\nTokugawa people that the imperialists were weakening, and that some of\r\nthe western clans, in particular Higo, were likely to afford them\r\nsympathy, if not actual support.\r\n\r\nM. Roches finally left Yokohama on June 23, having been succeeded by M.\r\nOutrey, with the intention of visiting Ozaka and Nagasaki on his way\r\nhome. His policy had proved a complete failure, as far as supporting the\r\nShôgun against the Mikado was concerned. He had succeeded however in\r\nprocuring for French engineers the construction of the arsenal at\r\nYokosuka and the engagement of a French military mission, which were\r\ncontinued for several years after the establishment of the new\r\ngovernment.\r\n\r\nNoguchi had an elder and a younger brother, the latter of whom had\r\njoined the followers of the Tokugawa who after the withdrawal of Keiki\r\nto Mito had gathered themselves together in the mausoleum enclosure at\r\nUyéno. Thence they issued forth at night and assassinated imperialist\r\nsoldiers from time to time. At last it was decided to attack them in\r\ntheir stronghold, and early in the morning of July 4 an advance was made\r\nwhich led to the destruction by fire of a considerable part of the city\r\nlying between the outer moat and the main gate of Uyéno, and also of the\r\ngreat temple building which occupied the centre of the enclosure. The\r\nburial places of the Shôguns were not damaged. Rinôji no Miya, the\r\nimperial prince who had always resided there in the character of abbot,\r\nand whom the recalcitrant Tokugawa men talked of raising to the throne\r\nas Mikado, was carried off by the survivors at the end of the day. The\r\nfighting began at eight o'clock in the morning and was over by five\r\no'clock in the evening. During this affair I was at Yokohama, having\r\nbeen kept there since my last visit to Yedo at the end of June. At the\r\nbeginning of that month Willis and I were in Yedo together for a few\r\ndays, while he attended to wounded men of the Satsuma and other clans,\r\nsuch as Toda, Chôshiû and Bizen. The latter occupied Tôzenji, which had\r\nformerly been the British Legation, and he recorded in his report the\r\nfact of his being received and treated by the Bizen men with great\r\ncourtesy, which showed that they entertained no feelings of hostility\r\nagainst foreigners, and regarded the death of Taki Zenzaburô as a just\r\nretribution for the attack on foreigners at Kôbé in the previous\r\nFebruary. The condition of these wounded men was deplorable, for at that\r\ntime Japan had no experienced surgeons, and the treatment of gunshot\r\nwounds was of a very amateurish character. There were but few cases of\r\nsword-cuts. Subsequently some of the more urgent cases were at Willis'\r\nsuggestion sent down to Yokohama, and towards the end of July there were\r\n176 patients in the building appropriated as a military hospital. Under\r\nthe previous government it had been a school for instruction in the\r\nChinese classics. Two-thirds of the number were Satsuma men, Chôshiû and\r\nTosa soldiers together made up a fourth. About 40 had been wounded in\r\nthe recent fighting at Uyéno, the others had received their injuries in\r\nthe expeditions to the north of Yedo against Aidzu. Willis' services\r\nwere so greatly appreciated that the minister was asked in October to\r\nlend them again to the troops which had been fighting in Echigo. This\r\narrangement was facilitated by the fact that he was now vice-consul at\r\nYedo, a post which he was unable to take up because the opening of the\r\ncity to foreign residence and trade had to be deferred; and he was\r\nrelieved at Yokohama by Dr J. B. Siddall who had been appointed medical\r\nofficer to the legation early in January.\r\n\r\nOn the 29th July I went to Yedo with Adams, and spent four days in\r\nvisiting Okuma, Katsu and Komatsu, but though I must have reported to my\r\nchief the result of the conversation with these persons of importance, I\r\nhave no record, except of voluminous translations from the Japanese of\r\nanti-Christian pamphlets and political documents of all kinds. I went\r\nalone to Yedo again on August 17, and next day called on Okuma, whom I\r\nfound in bed looking very ill. From him I learnt that fighting had\r\ncommenced on the 13th at Imaichi, near Nikkô. The imperialists were\r\nvictorious and were still advancing on Aidzu, 75 miles further. A\r\nmessenger who left Echigo on the 8th reported that Niigata was still\r\nheld by Aidzu men. Subsequently to the capture of Nagaoka by the\r\nimperial troops more fighting had taken place, in which both sides lost\r\nheavily. The imperialists were holding their ground, and expected\r\nfurther reinforcements which would enable them to advance on Wakamatsu,\r\nthe capital of Aidzu, at the same time as the divisions from Shirakawa\r\nand Akita. The Prince of Hizen, Okuma's own chief, had been urged by his\r\ntroops in Shimotsuké, where Imaichi is situated, to lead them against\r\nthe enemy, but his councillors (_karô_) had dissuaded him from taking\r\nthe field. Since the beginning of the year several constitutions had\r\nbeen framed and issued one after the other, and about this time I was\r\nengaged in translating the newest edition, which bore the date of June.\r\nIt showed marked traces of American political theories, and I have\r\nlittle doubt that Okuma and his fellow-clansman Soyéjima, pupils of Dr\r\nVerbeck, had had a considerable part in framing it. \"The power and\r\nauthority of the _Daijôkan_ (_i.e._ government), threefold, legislative,\r\nexecutive and judicial,\" was the wording of one article. By another it\r\nwas provided that \"All officers shall be changed after four years'\r\nservice. They shall be appointed by a majority of votes given by ballot.\r\nWhen the first period for changing the officers of government arrives,\r\nhalf of the present staff shall be retained for an additional space of\r\ntwo years, in order that there be no interruption of the public\r\nbusiness.\" In this we seemed to hear an echo of the \"spoils system.\"\r\nOkuma explained that the \"executive\" represented the executive\r\ndepartment in the United States Constitution, \"consisting of the\r\npresident and his advisers,\" but that in fact it was the head of the\r\nShintô religion, finance, war and foreign departments. It is needless to\r\nsay that this state paper has long ago been superseded by the existing\r\nItô constitution of 1889. Then I went on to Katsu. He said that Sumpu\r\n(now called Shidzuoka) was to have been formally handed over to the\r\nTokugawa family two days previously, but as a matter of fact it had\r\nalways formed part of their possessions. He took down from a shelf a\r\nmemorandum in which he had noted down some years before the names of the\r\nablest men in different clans. Many of them were already dead. Satsuma\r\nand Chôshiû accounted for the largest number; of the Tokugawa clan there\r\nwere very few. All our friends of Satsuma, Chôshiû and Tosa were among\r\nthe number of those still living. While I was there Tsumagi Nakadzukasa,\r\nwho had given me a dinner a couple of months earlier, came in. He had\r\nreturned a few days before from Mito, where he had left Keiki, employing\r\nhis leisure in the composition of Japanese poetry, and not expecting to\r\nbe invited at present to take a share in the government. This was an\r\nabsolutely baseless notion on his part, if he in reality entertained it.\r\nHe had sent an affectionate message to Katsu, which Tsumagi appeared to\r\nbe afraid of delivering in my presence, but it proved to be nothing more\r\nthan a warning to care for his personal safety, which was said to have\r\nbeen threatened by the hot-headed younger Tokugawa men. He said that\r\nabout 500 Mito men had gone to join Aidzu. The outcome of their\r\nconversation was that there was nothing in the existing political\r\nsituation to cause them anxiety. The Tokugawa people were desirous of\r\ngetting Katsu to take office under Kaménosuké, but he was unwilling. I\r\nasked him whether he had heard of a general feeling of dislike towards\r\nthe English. That he replied was an old thing, dating from the time when\r\nSir Harry used to advise the Shôgun's ministers to refrain from\r\nattacking Chôshiû. The idea was no doubt fostered by Roches, who told\r\nthem that unless they asked the British Government to lend naval\r\ninstructors, the English would back up the _daimiôs'_ party, and the\r\nwant of confidence in British friendship was the reason why Dutchmen had\r\nbeen engaged to bring out the \"Kaiyô-maru,\" a ship of war constructed in\r\nEngland for the Prince of Higo by Glover & Co. of Nagasaki, which had\r\ncome into the possession of the Mikado's adherents. I had heard from\r\nKomatsu and Nakai that imperialist troops landed from the \"Kaiyô-maru\"\r\nat Hirakata about the 5th or 6th August had gained a victory there over\r\na mixed force of Sendai men and Tokugawa _rônin_, and this was confirmed\r\nby Tsumagi. On the 19th I walked as far as the Nihom-bashi, the bridge\r\nin the centre of the city from which all distances were measured by\r\nroad, and from there to the huge hotel at the foreign settlement\r\nconstructed under the supervision of the Tokugawa government for the\r\naccommodation of foreigners. The commercial quarter was very lively, the\r\nstreets were crowded, especially by _samurai_ belonging to the\r\nimperialist forces, but the neighbourhood of the _daimiôs' yashikis_\r\nbelow the castle was like a city of the dead. On the 20th I had a visit\r\nfrom Kawakatsu Omi, an ex-commissioner for Foreign Affairs. He said that\r\nthe Castle of Sumpu was little better than a ruin, and that there were\r\nno houses which could receive the Tokugawa retainers. He would like to\r\nbecome a retainer of the Mikado (_chô-shin_); his family was not\r\noriginally in the service of the Tokugawa family, but was of more\r\nancient descent. He would be satisfied if he was made a minister of\r\npublic instruction. Midzuno Wakasa, a former governor of Yokohama, and\r\nSugiura Takésaburô, another Tokugawa man, would probably be employed by\r\nthe imperialist government to make all the arrangements with regard to\r\nthe foreign settlement at Yedo. Mimbu Taiyu, the younger brother of\r\nKeiki, then still in France, was to be fetched home to succeed the late\r\nPrince of Mito, who had died just about the time of Keiki's retreat\r\nthither. About a hundred and thirty _hatamotos_ went up to Kiôto in\r\nFebruary and by surrendering to the Mikado, secured the possession of\r\ntheir lands. He regretted that he had lost everything through not\r\nfollowing their example. The Tokugawa family were to retain 700,000\r\n_koku_ of lands, which would enable them to keep a good many retainers,\r\nbut not all the 30,000 who had hitherto belonged to the clan as\r\n_go-ké-nin_. My own Japanese escort, who belonged to the body of\r\n_betté-gumi_ created several years before to act as guards and escorts\r\nfor the foreign legations, 300 of whom were to be kept together for that\r\npurpose, all wanted to become Mikado's men.\r\n\r\nOn the 21st Komatsu and Nakai came to call on me. They said the troops\r\nsent by way of Hirakata to Tanagura in Oshiû had been completely\r\nvictorious, and that more would speedily follow. In fact, while we were\r\ntalking, 500 Satsuma men marched past the house along the main-road by\r\nthe seashore in order to embark for the north. Kido, who had gone to\r\nKiôto to report the state of affairs at Yedo, was expected back soon.\r\nThey thought that a good deal of pressure would be necessary to induce\r\nthe very conservative Kiôto Court to bring the Mikado there. That\r\nafternoon I called on Okuma, who was still very unwell, and, like most\r\nof the Hizen people, not disposed to be communicative. From him I went\r\nto Nakai, who showed me the draft of the state paper by which Gotô\r\noverturned the late government in the previous October. It differed\r\nslightly from the published copies, in that it contained proposals for\r\nthe engagement of French and English teachers of language, to get\r\nmilitary instructors from England, and to abolish the Tycoon and reduce\r\nthe Tokugawa clan to the same level as the others. These were all struck\r\nout on reconsideration in order to avoid exciting a suspicion that Gotô\r\nand his political allies were too partial to foreigners, and provoking\r\nthe hostility of the _fudai_ and _hatamotos_. He had also the drafts of\r\na letter from Higashi-Kuzé to Sanjô, in which, among other things which\r\nstrengthened the Aidzu resistance to the imperial troops, he reported\r\nthat foreign vessels anchored at Niigata and supplied the rebels with\r\narms and ammunition; and Higashi-Kuzé said that on his informing the\r\nforeign representatives of this, they replied that they would put a stop\r\nto the practice. I pointed out to Nakai that this must be a mistake. The\r\nMinisters having issued proclamations of neutrality had nothing to do\r\nwith their enforcement, and that if the Japanese authorities wished to\r\nput an end to this traffic, they had merely to notify to the foreign\r\nrepresentatives the blockade of the port of Niigata, and that a\r\nvessel-of-war was stationed there to prevent communication with the\r\nshore. This must have appeared a very strange doctrine to him, but\r\ninternational law was a complete novelty in Japan in those days. He also\r\nshowed me the draft of Komatsu's letter to Kiôto about the treatment of\r\nthe Nagasaki Japanese Christians, embodying the arguments recently used\r\nto him by Sir Harry, and advocating the adoption of milder measures.\r\n\r\nNext day I went again to see Nakai, and found with him a very attractive\r\nSatsuma man named Inouyé Iwami, who was greatly interested in the\r\ndevelopment of the resources of the island of Yezo. He was full of\r\nschemes for its colonization from Japan, and for the introduction of the\r\nEuropean system of farming under the supervision of a German named\r\nGaertner. He said that Shimidzudani, a young Court noble of about 25,\r\nwas to be governor of Hakodaté, and that he intended to make him learn\r\nEnglish. We discussed various leading personalities with considerable\r\nfreedom--I hinted that Higashi-Kuzé, in spite of his rank, was not the\r\nbest representative man to send to Europe as Ambassador. I thought Daté\r\nor Iwakura or even Kansô of Hizen would do better. He replied that\r\nIwakura could not be spared. The most important and interesting\r\nsuggestion he made was that the Mikado must move to Yedo, and make it\r\nhis Capital, as otherwise it would not be possible to keep in order the\r\nrebellious clans of the north. Both he and Komatsu, who joined us later\r\non at a restaurant on the river, approved of what I had suggested about\r\nthe blockade of Niigata.\r\n\r\nOn the 23rd I dined with Komatsu and Nakai to meet Okubo, the Satsuma\r\nstatesman who had suggested the removal of the Capital from Kiôto to\r\nOzaka earlier in the year. I have no doubt that the final decision to\r\nmake Yedo the centre of government, and to change its name to Tôkiô or\r\nEastern Capital was largely his work. He was very taciturn by\r\ndisposition, and the only information he vouchsafed was that Daté was to\r\ngo to Sendai to endeavour to persuade the _daimiô_, who was the head of\r\nthe Daté family and all its branches, to abandon the cause of Aidzu.\r\nKomatsu talked a good deal about the English naval instructors who had\r\nbeen engaged by the previous government, whom he evidently wished to get\r\nrid of, and I encouraged him to dismiss them, for I felt it would not be\r\nfair to insist on their keeping these officers in their service during a\r\nperiod of civil war, when the British neutrality proclamation prevented\r\ntheir making use of them. Komatsu told me that their plan was to retain\r\nthe services of the commissioned officers, but to send the petty\r\nofficers and seamen back to England.\r\n\r\nAbout two months before this time some Higo men had called on me, and\r\nsaid they were going north to Tsugaru. They argued that any other system\r\nthan feudalism was impossible in Japan. Now I heard that the Higo clan\r\nhad privately sent messengers to Wakamatsu to endeavour to effect a\r\nreconciliation between Aidzu and the _daimiôs_ of the west and south,\r\nbut Aidzu replied that matters had gone too far, and the questions at\r\nissue must be decided by the sword. I thought it likely that these\r\nenvoys from Higo were the men who had been to see me, as the ideas which\r\nthey entertained seemed to be similar.\r\n\r\nThe translation of the June Constitution, which superseded one that had\r\nbeen promulgated in March, had given me a great deal of trouble. I was\r\nunable to decide upon the best name in English for the second\r\ndepartment. It might be Imperial Council, Privy Council, or Cabinet. It\r\nappeared that the officials of this department were merely secretaries\r\nto the two prime ministers, and had no real executive authority; and\r\nthat the administration was divided into this nameless department and\r\nthe other four which followed it. This was Okubo's explanation. It was,\r\nhowever, pretty evident that this constitution was not to be the final\r\none, and it seemed to me to contain in itself the elements of change.\r\nThere were so many appointments that were held by dummies of high birth,\r\nwhile the real work was done by their underlings. The ancient ranks and\r\nprecedence had been practically done away with, and I could not help\r\nthinking that the court and territorial nobles (_kugé_ and _daimiôs_)\r\nwould have to be struck out of the list of officials. There was hardly\r\none of them fit to occupy the place of head of a department, and yet\r\nthese appointments were confined to them, no commoner being eligible.\r\n\r\nThe 25th August was chiefly occupied with arrangements made with Nakai\r\nfor the opening of Yedo on October 1, by instructions from the chief,\r\nthe abolition of the absurd existing rules about passports for\r\nforeigners proceeding to Yedo, and for ordering one of the naval\r\ninstructors there to buoy the channel. The ex-Tycoon's government had\r\narranged to have a huge hotel built for the accommodation of foreign\r\nvisitors, and the owners would have liked to let it, but it seemed\r\nunlikely that any foreigner would undertake to run such an establishment\r\non his own account, and I advised that they should engage a man from\r\nYokohama to act as steward for the proprietors, make out the visitors'\r\nbills and purchase the necessary wines and provisions.\r\n\r\nIt was evident that the imperialists were gathering their forces for a\r\ncombined attack on Aidzu, and as Nakai said, if they could not crush him\r\nwith their troops they now had in the field, they never would succeed.\r\nAn American sailing barque named the \"Despatch\" was hired for $3000 to\r\ncarry men to Hirakata. On August 25 I saw 200 men march through\r\nShinagawa to embark for the north; on the 22nd a large body of Chô-shiû\r\nmen arrived, and were billetted in Sengakuji, the temple in which the 47\r\nFaithful Rônins were buried. And Nakahara Naosuké, a Satsuma man,\r\nusually believed to be their admiral, but in reality an artillery\r\nofficer, had been sent to Echigo with four companies of artillery, and\r\ngreat things were expected of him.\r\n\r\nAugust 26 I went to see Katsu, and found him greatly relieved in his\r\nmind as the result of a visit paid to him on the previous day by\r\nKomatsu. He said that the Castle of Sumpu had been handed over to the\r\nhead of the Tokugawa clan on the 18th, but that the territories assigned\r\nto him had not yet been vacated by their previous possessors, who were\r\nvery difficult to move, so that the lands at present available did not\r\nexceed 80,000 _koku_ in extent. He hoped Kaménosuké, by which he, of\r\ncourse, meant the guardians of the six-year-old child, would not go to\r\nany great expense in building or in engaging crowds of retainers. He\r\nsaid that the \"Kaiyô-maru,\" flagship of Enomoto Idzumi, who commanded\r\nthe Tokugawa fleet, was supplied with provisions by that clan. Enomoto,\r\notherwise known as E. Kamajirô, was a naval officer who had been trained\r\nin Holland.\r\n\r\nI asked him whether the son of the late Prince of Mito was dead, or\r\nwhether he was to be set aside in favour of Mimbu Taiyu. On this he gave\r\nme the following account of Mito politics, which had been a puzzle for\r\nmany years to foreign observers.\r\n\r\nNoriakira, commonly called \"the old prince of Mito,\" was the younger son\r\nof Harutoshi, and his childhood's name (_zoku-miô_) was Keisaburô. His\r\nelder brother Narinobu was the heir, and his portion as a younger\r\nbrother was only 200 _koku_. Being averse to society on account of his\r\ndeafness, he spent his time in wandering about the country and\r\nacquainting himself with its actual condition, and no doubt then formed\r\nthe habits of simplicity and frugality which distinguished him in after\r\nlife. On the death of Harutoshi, Keisaburô's elder brother succeeded\r\nhim, but dying shortly afterwards, left the prince-dom vacant. By that\r\ntime two parties had gradually formed themselves in the Mito clan, one\r\nwhich supported the ancient Kiôto policy of the author of the\r\nDainihonshi, the other which, fearing Keisaburô, had formed an alliance\r\nwith the Court of Yedo, at that time ably directed by Midzuno Echizen no\r\nKami, father of Idzumi no Kami until lately a member of the Go-rôjiû\r\n(Council of State). The latter party schemed to set aside the claims of\r\nKeisaburô in favour of an adopted heir from the then Shôgun's family. A\r\nwill of the late prince was however discovered, in which he declared his\r\ndesire that the claims of blood should be respected, and his brother\r\nKeisaburô be appointed as his successor. The will was backed up by a\r\nstrong party known as the _Tengu-ren_, and Keisaburô became prince of\r\nMito. This was in 1834 when he was about 30 years of age.\r\n\r\nThe new prince was bent on carrying out certain reforms which the\r\nluxurious habits of the age appeared to him to render necessary. With\r\nthis object he obtained a relaxation of the ancient rule which required\r\nthe head of the house of Mito to be a resident in Yedo, the more easily\r\nbecause he had rendered himself obnoxious to the Go-rôjiû by the\r\nostentatious manner in which he seemed to reprove their pomp and luxury\r\nby the simplicity of his own dress and manner of life, and retiring to\r\nhis province on the pretext that it was necessary for him to superintend\r\npersonally the government of the clan, he devoted his time to drilling\r\ntroops in the only fashion then known in Japan. Openly advocating the\r\nsupremacy of the Mikado, and non-intercourse with the western world\r\n(_Kin-ô, jô-i_), he secretly introduced into the province every Dutch\r\nscholar he could find, and made himself acquainted as far as was then\r\npossible with the resources of European science. With incredible labour\r\nhe constructed from drawings contained in old Dutch books a frigate,\r\nwhich long lay at Yokohama for the protection of foreigners, but had he\r\nbelieved been since broken up. The report of his doings having been\r\nbrought to Yedo, it was represented to the Go-rôjiû that the drilling of\r\nmen and building of warships were merely preparations for carrying out\r\nthe traditional Mito policy, and that the prince was plotting rebellion.\r\nIn 1844 he was compelled to retire into seclusion, and he was succeeded\r\nby his son, the late prince, then a mere boy.\r\n\r\nIn 1851 a Dutch man-of-war made its appearance at Nagasaki, and caused\r\nno slight consternation at Yedo. It was said that the Nagasaki Dutchmen\r\nwere becoming restive, and that the ship was merely a precursor of the\r\nEnglish, who at that time bore the detestable reputation of being a\r\nnation of pirates ready for any violence. Succeeding events proved to\r\nthe Shôgun's government that Japan was in danger of being forced into\r\nrelations with European Powers; the advent of Admiral Perry and his\r\nsquadron heightened their alarm to such a degree that they yielded to\r\nthe voice of public opinion, and inviting the old prince of Mito to Yedo\r\nadmitted him again into their councils.\r\n\r\nIn 1858 the Shôgun Iyésada died, and the old prince of Mito wished to\r\nsecure the succession to his seventh son, who having been adopted as\r\nheir to the house of Shitotsubashi was in a legitimate position to\r\nbecome the Shôgun's heir. It was at this moment that Ii Kamon no Kami\r\ncame into power, and though it is uncertain whether he had a previous\r\nunderstanding with the Ki-shiû family that they should furnish an heir,\r\nit is certain that he found them ready to comply; and his influence was\r\nstrong enough to force old Mito to retire a second time into private\r\nlife, and to order Echizen, Tosa and Uwajima, who had supported the Mito\r\nclaims, to resign their _daimiates_ to their sons. The assassination of\r\nIi Kamon no Kami a couple of years later by Mito men was the\r\nconsequence.\r\n\r\nOther influences were then at work in the west. The Kiôto policy and the\r\nexpulsion of foreigners had been warmly espoused by Satsuma and\r\nChô-shiû. Hence the bond of union between them and the _Tengu-ren_\r\nsection of the Mito men, who on hearing that civil war had broken out at\r\nKiôto, made their appearance before the castle of the prince, and\r\ndemanded that he should carry out the clan policy. This action proving\r\nunsuccessful they raised the standard of rebellion on Mount Tsukuba in\r\nHitachi, whence they were expelled by the forces of the Shôgun after\r\nsome hard fighting. Their fate among the mountains of Kaga was a\r\nwell-known tale. Takéda Kô-un-sai, who had been driven by the force of\r\ncircumstances to join them, and several hundred of his comrades were\r\nbeheaded at Tsuruga. The remainder of the _Tengu-ren_ fled to Kiôto,\r\nwhere the ex-Tycoon, at that time still bearing the name of\r\nShitotsubashi, took them into his pay. Now that the revolution of the\r\nprevious January had so completely changed the face of affairs, these\r\nmen had returned to their native province, headed by Takéda Kinjirô, a\r\ngrandson of Kô-un-sai, and their political opponents, whom they styled\r\n_Kan-tô_ (traitors), finding themselves on the losing side, and likely\r\nto be in a perilous minority, since the _Tengu-ren_ were backed up by\r\nthe imperialists, had gone off to Echigo, to the number of some five\r\nhundred. The _Tengu-ren_, out of gratitude to their former protector,\r\nhad determined to set aside the heir in favour of Mimbu Taiyu,\r\nShitotsubashi's younger brother, and had despatched agents to bring the\r\nlatter back from Paris.\r\n\r\nThat day Nagaoka, younger brother of Higo, arrived by sea with a large\r\nnumber of retainers, and on the 29th the Prince of Awa marched in in\r\ngreat pomp with about 600 men. On the 28th I had a great feast with\r\nKomatsu, Inouyé Iwami and young Matsuné of Uwajima. One of the party\r\ndrank so much _saké_ that he lay down on the floor and went to sleep. In\r\nhalf an hour's time he woke up quite sober, and was able to repeat the\r\nprocess.\r\n\r\nFrom September 8 to October 17 Adams and I were absent on a wild-goose\r\nchase after the Russians who were reported to be occupying the northern\r\ncoast of Yezo, in the course of which H.M.S. \"Rattler,\" in which we had\r\nembarked, was wrecked in Sôya Bay. But as this was not concerned with\r\nthe progress of political events in Japan, it seems unnecessary to\r\noccupy space in narrating our experiences. We were rescued by the French\r\ncorvette \"Dupleix,\" Captain du Petit Thouars.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XXXIII\r\n\r\n              CAPTURE OF WAKAMATSU AND ENTRY OF THE MIKADO\r\n                               INTO YEDO\r\n\r\n\r\nNOVEMBER 6th was celebrated with much pomp and ceremony as being the\r\nMikado's birthday. A review of the 2/x regiment was held at Yokohama to\r\nwhich Sir Harry invited Sanjô, now promoted to the rank of Udaijin. The\r\nforeign men-of-war joined with the Kanagawa fort in firing a royal\r\nsalute, which the party viewed from my upstairs verandah overlooking the\r\nbay. Besides Sanjô we had Nagaoka Riônosuké, Higashi-Kuzé and\r\nMadé-no-kôji. A luncheon at the minister's residence followed, and the\r\nswords of honour sent out from England for presentation to Gotô and\r\nNakai in recognition of their gallant conduct on the 23rd of March were\r\nhanded over. Nakai at once girt his on, and strutted about with a\r\ngold-laced cap on his head, to his own great delight and the intense\r\namusement of the rest of the company. As it happened to be the second\r\nday of the Yokohama races it was proposed that the whole party should\r\nadjourn to the race-course. Sanjô and Higashi-Kuzé, who had on white\r\n_maedaré_ and black-lacquered paper caps, declined. I rode down with\r\nMadé-no-kôji and Nagaoka, who enjoyed themselves immensely. On returning\r\nhome I took Nakai in with me and gave him tea; in exchange for this he\r\ninformed me that news had been received of the capture of the outer\r\ncastle of Wakamatsu, and that only the inner ring and citadel remained\r\nin possession of the defenders; also that the Mikado would arrive at\r\nYedo about November 27.\r\n\r\nNext day I went up to Yedo on board a Japanese steamer belonging to the\r\nYokosuka arsenal with Sanjô, Higashi-Kuzé, Nagaoka and Nakai. By a\r\nmistake of Nakai's about the hour of leaving I kept the party waiting\r\nfor me at the custom house and a mounted messenger had to be sent to\r\nfetch me. I hurried down and found them sitting quietly smoking. They\r\nprotested against my apologising. How different from some Europeans!\r\n\r\nOn the 8th Mitford and I went to call on Katsu. His wife had gone off to\r\nSumpu, but he remained to do the \"head muck-and-bottle-washing\"\r\n(_miso-zuri_) of the clan. He hoped to obtain the Shimidzu lands,\r\namounting to 110,000 _koku_, for feeding the retainers who had lost\r\ntheir lands and pay. Instead of the lands promised in Oshiû, part of\r\nMikawa and the whole of Enshiû had been conceded, but the _daimiôs_\r\nhitherto entitled had not yet given up possession. Keiki had preceded\r\nKaménosuké to Sumpu. Katsu also had a story that Brunet, one of the\r\nFrench military instructors, went off in the Kayô-maru, when the\r\nTokugawa naval squadron left the Yedo anchorage on the night of October\r\n4. We doubted this, as we knew that he had just received promotion in\r\nthe French army. Nevertheless it turned out to be a fact. He was\r\naccompanied by another officer named Caseneuve, and several other\r\nFrenchmen.\r\n\r\nWe also visited Nakai, who gave us a first-rate dinner from the hotel.\r\nHe said that the citadel of Wakamatsu was captured on October 29. He had\r\nalso received a letter from Kido placing the question of the Mikado's\r\ncoming to Yedo beyond a doubt. And as we returned to my house we found\r\nthat great preparations were already being made in anticipation of His\r\nMajesty's arrival, roads being re-made, bridges rebuilt, and ward-gates\r\nbeing constructed in side streets where they had never existed before.\r\n\r\nOne of my _betté_ Sano Ikunosuké called to present his thanks for having\r\nbeen selected by the court to remain one of the Yedo guard for\r\nforeigners; all my sixteen men had been engaged for this service. He\r\nsaid that the Shimidzu domain had been granted provisionally to the\r\nTokugawa family for the purpose mentioned by Katsu. To-day (November 9)\r\nwas the last day on which men of the Tokugawa clan could send in their\r\nnames for service under the Mikado. In some cases they would receive\r\nabout half their former revenue, but others would be better off than\r\nbefore, because their allowances, though nominally diminished, would be\r\nissued in rice instead of in money at a low fixed rate. That evening\r\nMitford and I dined with Nagaoka at the Higo _yashiki_ in Shirokané,\r\nclose by our legation, Higashi-Kuzé and Nakai being the other guests. It\r\nwas a dinner in European style served from the hotel in a picturesque\r\ntwo-storeyed house, built in the garden so as to command a view over the\r\n_nagaya_ in the direction of the bay. In the garden there were some\r\nsplendid trees and pretty shaded nooks. Hosokawa himself was there, very\r\nfat and amiable, very small eyes and a tendency to \"fly catching.\" On\r\nthe 10th I went back to Yokohama.\r\n\r\nAt an interview on November 16 between all the Foreign Representatives,\r\nHigashi-Kuzé and Térashima, the Japanese ministers stated that the\r\ncastle of Wakamatsu had surrendered on the 6th November to the imperial\r\nforces. The two princes, father and son, in robes of ceremony and\r\npreceded by a retainer carrying a large banner inscribed with the word\r\n\"surrender\" (_kô-fuku_), and followed by the garrison, likewise in robes\r\nof ceremony and with their heads shaven, came to the camp of the\r\nbesiegers and gave themselves up. The castle and all the arms it\r\ncontained were handed over, and the two princes retired into strict\r\nseclusion (_kin-shin_) at a Buddhist monastery in the town. Nakamura\r\nHanjirô, the chief of the staff (_gun-kan_) wept when he went to take\r\ndelivery of the castle and its contents. It was a pleasure to us to see\r\nhow the countenances of some of those who had to listen to the story\r\nfell, for they had counted on a desperate resistance on the part of\r\nAidzu to defeat the imperialist party and frustrate the policy of the\r\nBritish Legation. Now that this exciting episode was at an end, the\r\nspeedy submission of the other northern clans could be counted on with\r\nconfidence. The detailed report made by the Hizen clan, dated November\r\n16, published in the \"Kiôto Gazette,\" shows that the garrison included\r\n_samurai_ soldiers 764, troops of a lower class 1609, wounded 570,\r\noutlaws from other territories (_rônin_) 462; women and children 639,\r\nofficials 199, civilians 646, personal attendants of the princes 42, and\r\nporters 42. There was no record of the number of men killed in the\r\ndefence. On November 19 I went to Yedo with Captain Stanhope, Charles\r\nWirgman the artist, and Dr. Siddall, after breakfasting with Du Petit\r\nThouars on board the \"Dupleix.\" Adams and William Marshall went up by\r\nroad. On our arrival possession was at once taken of Siddall, by a\r\nJapanese doctor named Takéda Shingen, and he was carried off to the\r\nmilitary hospital established at the Tôdô _yashiki_ in the Shitaya\r\nquarter. On the 21st Adams, Mitford, Marshall and Wirgman went to the\r\nYoshiwara and had a feast in fine style at the Kimpeirô, part of which\r\nwas furnished in western style for such Japanese guests as liked it. The\r\nadmission of Europeans into that quarter of the town, from which they\r\nhad until then been jealously shut out, was hailed as the dawn of a day\r\nof friendly intercourse of the frankest character. Next evening I gave a\r\ngreat entertainment at my own house. There were three _geisha_ from\r\nShimmei-mae and two _taikomochi_ (jesters). We kept it up boisterously\r\ntill midnight. The jesters performed a foreigner and his escort arriving\r\nat the Kawasaki ferry on the way to Yedo, and meeting with the usual\r\nobstruction at the hands of the men placed there to guard the crossing.\r\nMy escort men also exhibited some comic scenes, much to their own\r\nsatisfaction and to the delight of the household, who were admitted to a\r\nroom at the top of the stairs. Letters arrived from the chief to say\r\nthat he wanted a stand erected for himself opposite to the gate of our\r\nformer legation buildings, in front of Sengakuji, for him to see the\r\nMikado pass in (he was expected to reach Yedo on the 27th), and that\r\nHigashi-Kuzé and I must go down to Yokohama on the 24th to see himself.\r\nWe wrote in reply to say that a stand was altogether an impossibility,\r\nseeing what Japanese etiquette was in such matters, and that I could not\r\nleave Siddall alone in Yedo without some one to interpret for him. So\r\nnext day Wirgman and I went over to see Siddall, and found that the Tôdô\r\n_yashiki_ had now been turned into a general hospital. Here we fell in\r\nwith old Ishigami, the Satsuma doctor who married a daughter of old\r\nFreiherr von Siebold by a Japanese mother, a very cheery person. After\r\nlunch we went with him and a crowd of other Japanese doctors to Uyéno,\r\nintending to get in and examine the scene of the fighting that took\r\nplace on July 4, but the gate was shut in our face, and though we waited\r\nand argued patiently for a whole hour with the sentries, we could not\r\nconvince them that we might safely be admitted. I think our Japanese\r\ncompanions felt even more annoyance than we did. The gateway was riddled\r\nwith bullets, and it was evident that a pretty stiff fight had taken\r\nplace there in July.\r\n\r\nWe stayed the night at the hospital, and spent a jolly evening with\r\nIshigami and another doctor named Yamashita. Next morning, in spite of\r\nthe bitter cold, we went round the wards with the doctors. All the state\r\napartments of the _daimiô's_ mansion (_go-ten_) had been converted into\r\nwards, and provided with iron bedsteads and hair mattresses. There was a\r\nvery plucky little Tosa boy, probably a drummer, who had had his foot\r\namputated. Then our attention was attracted to an aristocratic-looking\r\nlittle surgeon from Chôshiû, with his sleeves turned up like ruffles\r\nover a pair of delicate little wrists. At noon there came the two\r\nbrothers Notsu, Shichizayemon and Shichiji, who persuaded Wirgman and\r\nmyself to go to the Yoshiwara with them, instead of keeping an\r\nengagement with Nakai. Siddall compounded _mistura vini gallici_, and\r\nafter partaking of this we started on a journey of exploration. It was a\r\nterribly cold day, with a gale from the north-west coming straight down\r\nthe plain from the snowy peak of Asama-yama and other mountains of\r\nShinshiû. The Yoshiwara lay right out in the middle of the rice-fields,\r\noccupying a considerable extent of ground. It was entered through a\r\nnarrow gate at the end of a long causeway. After passing this gate, we\r\nwere introduced into the upstairs rooms of a rather shabby house,\r\nevidently much frequented by the Satsuma clan. _Geishas_ were of course\r\nsent for, and the _saké_-cup circulated merrily. Towards nightfall it\r\nwas proposed that we should visit the Kimpeirô, a hideous house\r\nfurnished in what was regarded as European style; but we stayed there\r\nonly a few minutes, and then returned to the house where we had first\r\nbeen entertained. Here we had more drinking, dancing and playing at\r\n_nanko_. In this game a wooden chopstick is broken up into six pieces,\r\nof which each player receives three. He puts in one palm as many as he\r\nthinks fit, and guesses at the total of what his hand and the hand of\r\nthe other player contain. If he guesses right, the loser has to drink,\r\nand his turn comes to give the challenge. Evidently this is the way to\r\nget speedily drunk. We stopped there till a message came from Ishigami\r\nto say that he was awaiting us at another house to drink sober again. We\r\nwent in search of him to a restaurant on the river bank, the\r\n_Yu-mei-rô_, where much singing, dancing, drinking and _nanko_ followed,\r\ntill we had had enough of it, and came home by boat to the hospital,\r\naccompanied by three of the _geishas_. Next afternoon the artist and I\r\nsaid good-bye to Siddall, and walked over to Nakai's, but not finding\r\nhim at home, we went to the hotel for refreshment, where we sat down in\r\nthe garden and found ourselves overwhelmed with melancholy at the\r\nugliness of the building. For five cups of tea and a bundle of Manila\r\ncheroots the manager charged us a dollar, to the surprise and horror of\r\nthe Japanese boy who waited on us. To him it appeared an exorbitant\r\ndemand. The cheroots were perhaps worth 20 cents, which left 16 cents\r\nfor a cup of tea. On getting home to Takanawa we found that Rickerby,\r\nthe proprietor and editor of the \"Japan Times,\" had just arrived in a\r\nboat from Yokohama to witness the ceremony of the following day.\r\n\r\nNovember 26, 1868. About ten o'clock in the morning the Mikado passed\r\ninto Yedo, having slept at Shinagawa. Mitford, the artist, Rickerby and\r\nI saw the procession from the open space recently created in front of\r\nthe new gate of what had previously been Sir Harry Parkes' diplomatic\r\nresidence, now transformed into a sort of foreign office. The display\r\ncould not be described as splendid, for the effect of what was oriental\r\nin the courtiers' costumes was marred by the horribly untidy soldiers\r\nwith unkempt hair and clothing vilely imitated from the west. The\r\nMikado's black-lacquered palanquin (_hôren_) was to us a curious\r\nnovelty. As it passed along the silence which fell upon the crowd was\r\nvery striking. Old Daté, who rode between it and the closed chair in\r\nwhich the Mikado was really seated, nodded to us in a friendly manner.\r\nRickerby wrote and published an excellent newspaper account of the whole\r\nshow a few days afterwards in the \"Japan Times.\" In the afternoon he and\r\nI walked to Kai-an-ji, a Buddhist religious house at Shinagawa,\r\ncelebrated for its very pretty plantations of maple. From there we\r\nproceeded to a house of entertainment, the Kawasaki-ya, close by, to\r\ndrink _saké_ and crack jokes with the girls about the Prince of Bizen,\r\nwho had passed the night there. The house was full of troops from the\r\nwest, but they scarcely took any notice of us, and in fact all those we\r\nmet on the road ignored us completely. It must be said that whenever I\r\nwent out into the streets of Yedo I was always accompanied by my Aidzu\r\n_samurai_ Noguchi and from four to six of my personal escort of the\r\n_betté-gumi_.\r\n\r\nOn the 28th Sir Harry and Dr. Alford the Bishop of Victoria, Hongkong,\r\ncame up to Yedo, and were entertained in European style at the new\r\nforeign office by Daté and Higashi-Kuzé. Machida and Môri, young Satsuma\r\nmen, were also of the party. Both had been in England and spoke English,\r\nthe latter, who was only about one-and-twenty, particularly well.\r\n\r\nNext day Mitford and I went to call on Nakai. We met there Machida, and\r\nYamaguchi Hanzô, a Hizen _samurai_, who brought with him a man who had\r\njust returned from Shônai. He reported that Shônai had submitted on the\r\n4th instant, and that two foreigners, one an American, the other an\r\nEnglishman, both from Hakodaté, were present as spectators. Nakai, who\r\nwas a member of the local government of the city, now called the\r\nTô-kei-fu instead of Yedo, had given in his resignation because he found\r\nthat the governor-general instead of placing confidence in himself and\r\nthe other officials, was in the habit of upsetting their arrangements on\r\nthe complaint of a few wretched tradespeople.\r\n\r\nWirgman and I went down to Yokohama on the 30th, walking as far as\r\nNamamugi-mura (where Richardson was murdered in 1862), whence we took\r\nboat across to the foreign settlement. At Kawasaki-ya in Shinagawa we\r\nfell in with Notsu Shichizayémon and Ijiû-in, with two Kurohané men and\r\none from Utsunomiya, companions on the occasion of our visit to the\r\nYoshiwara, of whom the Satsuma men were on their way home. There was a\r\nlarge consumption of _saké_ and Japanese dishes, and much Doric Japanese\r\nspoken. Further on, at Mmé-yashiki or Bai-rin, as it had now become the\r\nfashion to call this very pleasant half-way house between Yedo and the\r\nferry at Kawasaki, we found Oyama, who was like the others returning to\r\nKagoshima as the civil war was practically at an end. We drank many\r\nparting cups together, and then walked with him to his hotel at\r\nKawasaki. The road was full of homeward bound Satsuma men and Tokugawa\r\npeople going to Sumpu. A report had got about that difficulties had\r\narisen between Satsuma and Higo, and that the latter in conjunction with\r\nArima and Chikuzen were going to fall upon the great clan; that in\r\nconsequence of this the troops were rushing off as fast as possible to\r\nforestal the attack. Another rumour, much credited by the French\r\nLegation, was that Aidzu surrendered only on condition that the Satsuma\r\ntroops should be withdrawn from the east and north of the country, and\r\nthe Mikado come to Yedo. But as others besides the Satsuma fighting men\r\nwere also going home, these stories were easily discredited. On December\r\n3 I went back to Yedo, half-way in a _kago_ (common palanquin) from\r\nKanagawa, and on foot from Kawasaki. At Bai-rin I met Midzuno Chinami,\r\nhurrying back from Shimoda where he had been put ashore from H.M.S.\r\n\"Manila.\" Here was the late governor of Yokohama, who last year used to\r\nride in a state palanquin (_nagabô_), with a large cortége and preceded\r\nby running footmen crying _shitaniro_, \"down on your knees,\" now\r\ntravelling in a wretched cheap hackney _kago_, without a single\r\nretainer. For all that he seemed cheerful enough. A good deal of my time\r\nin those days was passed in the compilation of an English-Japanese\r\ndictionary of the spoken language and in reading Japanese novels. On the\r\n4th I went over to the hospital, where I found Siddall with his hands\r\nfull, wounded men from Echigo having begun to arrive. Willis had gone on\r\nfrom Echigo to Wakamatsu to look after the Aidzu wounded, of whom there\r\nwere nearly 600 in the castle when it was surrendered. My new pony\r\n\"Fushimi,\" a present from Katsu before he left Yedo, carried me\r\nsplendidly; the imperialists who crowded the streets appeared to admire\r\nwith envy a black chimney-pot hat which I was wearing. On the 5th I went\r\nthere again to pass the night, with Ishigami and Yamashita. They\r\ncomplained bitterly of one Mayéda Kiôsai, who had been appointed chief\r\nof the hospital, and said that the patients had threatened to cut his\r\nhead off because he spent his time in driving about the city in a\r\ncarriage and pair instead of attending to his duties. The reflection\r\ncame naturally that you cannot make a silk purse out of a sow's ear, or\r\ngive the standing of an European physician to a Japanese half-educated\r\napothecary.\r\n\r\nOn December 9 I went to the hotel to dine with Machida. The\r\nindispensable Nakai was there, also Okubo and Yoshii. The latter had\r\nleft Wakamatsu on December 1st. Willis was there looking after the\r\nwounded, of whom he said there were at least two thousand on the Aidzu\r\nside alone. Snow was lying deep both in Echigo and Aidzu. Shônai was\r\npacified, and the whole country might now be said to be at peace, a\r\nstate of things which of course was displeasing to anti-imperialists,\r\nwhether among diplomatists or merchants. Information had arrived that\r\nthe murderers of the two sailors of H.M.S. \"Icarus\" in August 1867 had\r\nbeen discovered; they were from Chikuzen and the party to which they\r\nbelonged was said to number nine in all. This of course would be welcome\r\nnews to the Tosa people. It was strange that retainers of Chikuzen, who\r\nentertained Admiral King so hospitably in January should have been\r\nguilty of such a wanton crime. The newly issued paper money, known as\r\n_kinsatsu_, was much discussed, and it was evidently creating a great\r\nferment among the people. Uchida, the mayor (_nanushi_) of Kanasugi, who\r\nhad been to see me a few days earlier, said that a refusal to receive\r\nthese notes in the payment of taxes was the only obstacle to their free\r\ncirculation. Nakai denied the correctness of the statement that taxes\r\nmight not be paid with them, but he thought that in the end it would be\r\nfound necessary to establish a proper banking system by giving authority\r\nto the great firm of Mitsui to issue notes against a reserve of coin or\r\nbullion. It was a matter of vital importance to the imperial government,\r\nwhich had not found any money in the Tokugawa treasury, and the Mikado\r\nhad always been kept very poorly supplied by the Shôgun's ministers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XXXIV\r\n\r\n          ENOMOTO WITH THE RUNAWAY TOKUGAWA SHIPS SEIZES YEZO\r\n\r\n\r\nON December 11 Machida came to me with a report from Hakodaté that the\r\nTokugawa pirates, as they were styled after their refusal to surrender\r\nand their exodus from Yedo Bay on October 4, had landed at that port\r\nfrom the Kaiyô-maru and her consorts. The rebels were led by a member of\r\nthe French military mission sent out in 1866 who had gone off with them\r\nwhen they left the bay, and it was very annoying for the French Legation\r\nthat this officer should have violated the neutrality proclaimed by the\r\nMinister, and have joined rebels against the authority of a sovereign\r\nwith whom France maintained friendly relations. A fight had ensued near\r\nHakodaté, in which a large number of imperialists were killed or\r\nwounded. The Yokohama foreign press however represented that the\r\nMikado's men had won the victory at a place about 15 miles from the\r\nport. According to despatches received from the consul the rebels had\r\nhad by far the best of it. The foreign residents were in a great state\r\nof alarm. The consul wrote thus: \"As the enemy approach we shall retire\r\ntowards the hill; if he comes nearer, we shall go up the hill, and\r\nshould it come to the last extremity we shall have no resource but to\r\nput our trust in an over-ruling Power.\" Nakai came on the 13th to talk\r\nabout the new paper money, and the difficulties with foreigners to which\r\nit would give rise. Tom Glover's opinion was quoted in favour of a paper\r\ncirculation, but he did not himself agree that a merchant, who was\r\nnaturally an interested party, should be regarded as an authority on\r\ncurrency. This paper money had been issued to the troops, who forced the\r\nshop-keepers and the hucksters on the high roads to accept it in\r\npayment. But this could not go on long, for the paper did not pass\r\ncurrent amongst the civilian population. We spoke about the state of\r\nforeign relations. He admitted that the old distrust of foreigners still\r\nexisted; the foreign representatives were regarded as a necessary evil,\r\nto be endured, but not to be embraced. Nothing pleased the Mikado's\r\ngovernment so much as to see the diplomatists living at Yokohama, and\r\nthe idea of asking their advice upon any matter was never entertained\r\nfor a moment. In fact the representatives were looked upon much in the\r\nsame light as the agents (_rusui_) of the _daimiôs_, _i.e._ persons sent\r\nto Japan by their respective governments to receive the Mikado's orders,\r\nwhenever occasion might arise. The representatives were themselves\r\npartly to blame for this state of things. Fine houses, comfortable\r\nliving and whole skins at Yokohama were doubtless preferable to\r\nmakeshifts and dangers at Yedo, but for all they knew or could learn of\r\npending international questions they might just as well be resident at\r\nHongkong.\r\n\r\nAnother day was spent with the mayor of Kanasugi and three or four\r\nretainers at the classical theatre Kongo-daiyu in Iigura chô, to see\r\n_Nô_ and _Kiôgen_. Minami Torajirô was also among the audience. This was\r\na young Aidzu _samurai_, who had come in the previous April to see me,\r\nwith his countryman Hirozawa, when I had a great argument with the\r\nlatter about Japanese politics and especially about the part our\r\nLegation had taken. It was the first time a foreigner had been present\r\nat this kind of theatrical performance. _Nô_ is a sort of tragedy or\r\nhistorical play, _Kiôgen_ is low comedy. There is no scenery and the\r\ncostumes are all in an ancient style. The stage is about 24 feet square,\r\nand a long passage on the left connects it with the greenroom from which\r\nthe actors make their appearance. There are 200 _Nô_, and printed books\r\nof the text, known as _utai_, could be bought for a trifling cost. They\r\nare delivered in slow recitative to the accompaniment of the music, or\r\nrather dissonance, of the fife and small drum. The orchestra, likewise\r\ndressed in antique fashion, were seated on campstools at the back of the\r\nstage. The _Kiôgen_, which pleased me most, were _Suyéhirogari_, in\r\nwhich a sort of Moses Primrose is sent to Kiôto to buy a fan, and is\r\ncheated by the merchant into paying 500 _riô_ for an umbrella, and _Oba\r\nga saké_, in which a fellow having tried in vain to persuade his aunt, a\r\nrich old curmudgeon, to give him some _saké_, puts on a devil's mask and\r\nfrightens her into submission, while he goes to get drunk at the store\r\nroom where the liquor is kept. He threatens to eat her if she looks his\r\nway; her cries,\"Oh fearful to behold; spare your retainer's life\"; her\r\nanger on discovering in the drunken and sleepy demon her rascally\r\nnephew, were infinitely diverting. The _Nô_ I could not understand until\r\nI borrowed the book from a Japanese lady in the next box, and was\r\nenabled to follow the text. This was _Hachi no ki_. Sano Genzayémon, who\r\nhas been deprived of his feudal estate, entertains a Buddhist priest at\r\nnight. Having no food to offer him nor fuel to warm the room, he cuts\r\ndown his own favourite dwarf plum, cherry and pine trees, and makes a\r\nfire of the branches. In return for this the holy man persuades the Lord\r\nof Kamakura to restore to him his forfeited lands. There were at that\r\ntime three other companies of _nô-yakusha_; Kanzé-daiyu, Kôshô-daiyu and\r\nKompara-daiyu. The audience consisted entirely of the _samurai_ class.\r\n\r\nThe two Aidzu princes were brought to the suburb of Senji on December\r\n15. Matsudaira Higo (now, like all other rebels, shorn of his title of\r\n_Kami_) was placed in the charge of Inshiû, and Wakasa in that of\r\nChikuzen. Ninnaji no Miya, the commander-in-chief of the imperialist\r\nforces engaged in Echigo and Oshiu, was expected to arrive in Yedo on\r\nthe 17th. And on or about the 16th the foreign representatives were\r\nofficially notified of the restoration of peace. The guns and stores of\r\nH.M.S. \"Rattler\" which had perforce to be left behind at Sôya when the\r\n\"Dupleix\" brought us away, had been offered to the Mikado's government\r\nand accepted by them. This was the news heard from Okubo and Yoshii,\r\nwhom I met at Nakai's on the 16th.\r\n\r\nAs a measure of protection for British and French subjects at Hakodaté\r\nthe \"Satellite\" and \"Vénus\" were despatched thither on the 14th, the\r\nformer conveying our secretary of legation Adams. His \"History of\r\nJapan,\" vol. ii., gives an account of what he saw and did there. Up to\r\nthe 5th of December however that place had not been threatened with an\r\nattack from the fugitive Tokugawa navy.\r\n\r\nMy old writing master Tédzuka, who came to call, gave me the following\r\nstatistics about his clan. The chief's name was Sengoku Sanuki no Kami,\r\nand he ruled over territories assessed at 30,000 _koku_. The actual\r\nyield to the _daimiô_ was 16,000 _koku_ of rice; of this 8000 _koku_\r\nwere accounted for by fiefs held by retainers; 4000 _koku_ were required\r\nfor the maintenance of the _daimiô's_ personal establishment, and an\r\nequal quantity went in expenses of administration. The latter included\r\nofficial salaries, cost of journeys to court at Yedo, of soldiers in the\r\nfield, arms, etc. The clan numbered no more than 60 _samurai_ families.\r\nIts constitution as regards the offices of _karô_ and _yônin_ was the\r\nsame as in the case of other clans. In accordance with orders\r\npromulgated in No. 5 of the Kiôto Gazette the old practice of hereditary\r\noffice-holding had been abolished, and a system of promotion by merit\r\nestablished in its stead. In order to carry out these new arrangements,\r\nthe hereditary fiefs of the retainers ought he thought to be equalized.\r\n\r\nWhen I went back to Yokohama on the 18th I found that news had been\r\nreceived of the capture, which I had anticipated, of Hakodaté by the\r\nrunaway Tokugawa ships, and the flight of Shimidzu-dani with all his\r\nstaff. The consul was, as one would expect, very seriously alarmed. And\r\nfrom the \"Satellite's\" expedition to the spot one could not look for any\r\nresults of importance.\r\n\r\nOn December 21 a great conference was held at the legation in Yokohama\r\nof the chief with Daté, Higashi-Kuzé, Komatsu, Kido, Machida and Ikébé\r\nGoi (of Yanagawa in Kiûshiû). The first thing they wanted was that Sir\r\nHarry would arrange to give Yamaguchi Hanzô a passage on board an\r\nEnglish man-of-war to Hakodaté, in order that he might open negotiations\r\nwith the rebel leaders. The chief seemed to me to fear that this would\r\ninvolve him too much in the opinion of the public as a partizan of the\r\nimperial government, and he advised them instead to despatch a common\r\nmessenger across the strait from Awomori bearing written offers to\r\ntreat. Seeing that they could not induce him to accede to their request,\r\nthey acquiesced in his suggestion, but in such a half-hearted manner as\r\nto make one doubt whether they would follow his advice. A great\r\ndiscussion took place on the Christian question, in which the Japanese\r\nspoke very reasonably, and Sir Harry likewise, until he unfortunately\r\nlost his temper over the arguments used by Kido, and made use of very\r\nviolent language such as I do not care to repeat. The result was that\r\nthey promised to write Notes to the Foreign Representatives announcing\r\nthe Mikado's intention of showing clemency to the converts. Next day\r\nIkébé came to me to explain the theory of the imperial paper currency,\r\nbut I did not understand much of what he said, and we wandered off into\r\nother subjects, especially Christianity. The old fellow professed to be\r\nnot only an admirer of its doctrines, but also a believer. In the\r\nafternoon the chief and I went to return Daté's call at what had\r\nformerly been the governor's official residence at Tobé, a suburb of\r\nYokohama. They had a long conversation, especially about the Christian\r\nquestion and the representative system, and Sir Harry tried to pump him\r\nabout the future capital. Would it be at Kiôto, Ozaka or Yedo (Tokei,\r\nTôkiô), for we had of course read what Okubo Ichizô had written on the\r\nsubject early in the year. The old prince gave him some very polite\r\n\"digs in the ribs\" about his violent language of the previous day,\r\nsaying that when people became animated in conversation, spectators were\r\napt to think that a dispute was going on, whereas instead of that being\r\nthe case, it was merely that the speakers were in earnest; and naturally\r\nevery man desired to express his own views. The chief replied that his\r\nanimation was caused by the extreme regret he felt at seeing the\r\nJapanese do things that were prejudicial to themselves. On this Daté\r\nobserved that it did them good now and then, to be got angry with (_hara\r\nwo tatté morau_). This set the chief \"a-thynkynge,\" and as we were\r\ndriving home he suddenly said: \"I think they would never have spoken to\r\nthe other representatives about Christianity, had it not been for the\r\nlittle piece of excitement I got up yesterday.\" I replied: \"Well, it may\r\nbe so but I think you hurt Kido's feelings; he shut up at once and\r\npreserved a marked silence.\" \"Did you think so?\" says P. \"I am sorry to\r\nthink he was offended.\" I then said: \"If you will excuse my speaking\r\nfreely, I believe that although that sort of thing may have a good\r\neffect in a particular case, it makes the Japanese dread interviews with\r\nyou.\" Upon this the chief declared that he would have Kido to breakfast\r\nthe next morning, and begged me to write him as polite a note of\r\ninvitation as possible.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XXXV\r\n\r\n                  1869--AUDIENCE OF THE MIKADO AT YEDO\r\n\r\n\r\nON January 2 I went back to Yedo (as we long continued to call the\r\nEastern capital, being, like most Englishmen, averse to innovation). The\r\ncity had been opened to foreign trade and residence on the 1st, and dear\r\nold William Willis was installed as H.M. vice-consul. He and Adams had\r\nreturned on December 29th, the one from caring for the wounded in Echigo\r\nand Aidzu, the other from Hakodaté.\r\n\r\nOn January 5 we had an audience of the Mikado. On this occasion Sir\r\nHarry asked a large number of naval and military officers, besides\r\nCaptain Stanhope, R.N., of the \"Ocean,\" and Colonel Norman, in command\r\nof the 2/ix. So the list of persons to be presented, fixed originally at\r\ntwelve, was increased to double that figure. As usual the chief had\r\nmismanaged the business, because he insisted on doing it all himself\r\ninstead of leaving details to his subordinates, and he did not even know\r\nthe names of those who were to be presented. The Squadron furnished a\r\nguard of a hundred marines. The costumes worn were very various,\r\nespecially those of the legation and consulate men. It was a terribly\r\ncold day, snow falling, which changed into sleet, and then into rain by\r\nthe time we reached the castle, and what made things worse was that we\r\nhad to ride on horseback instead of driving in carriages. The audience\r\ntook place in the palace of the Nishi-no-Maru, just inside the Sakurada\r\nGate. We were allowed to ride over the first bridge, past the usual\r\n_géba_ or notice to alight, right up to the abutments of the second\r\nbridge, where we got down. Here we were met by Machida, who conducted us\r\ninto the courtyard, from which we ascended at once into the\r\nante-chamber. The Prince of Awa, Sanjô, Higashi-Kuzé, Nakayama Dainagon\r\nand Okubo came in and exchanged the usual compliments. Then we were\r\nushered into a very dark room, where the Mikado was sitting under a\r\ncanopy rather larger than that used at Ozaka. It was so dark that we\r\ncould hardly distinguish his dress, but his face, which was whitened\r\nartificially, shone out brightly from the surrounding obscurity. The\r\nPrime Minister stood below on the right and after H.M. had uttered a few\r\nwords of inquiry about the Queen's health, and congratulated the chief\r\non continuing at Yedo as minister, read the Mikado's speech. To this Sir\r\nHarry replied very neatly. After the audience, which took up no more\r\nthan five minutes, was over we cantered back to the old Legation\r\nbuilding in Takanawa, now converted into a branch of the Japanese\r\nForeign Office, where we had great feasting beginning by an\r\nentertainment in Japanese style, very good of its kind, followed by a\r\nlate luncheon supplied from the hotel. Awa and Higashi-Kuzé presided in\r\nour room. The American Minister and the North German Chargé d'Affaires\r\nwere also present. Higashi-Kuzé proposed the health of the Queen, the\r\nPresident and the King of Prussia _en bloc_, after which we drank to the\r\nhealth of the Mikado.\r\n\r\nKatsu had come back to Yedo, and early in January was to start again for\r\nSumpu, to lay a foundation for negotiation with the Tokugawa runaway\r\nships at Hakodaté. On the 8th a review of the English troops in garrison\r\nat Yokohama was held for the entertainment of the prince of Awa, as our\r\nparticular friend, and a party of young Court nobles. These were not men\r\nof political importance, and I do not think we ever heard of them again.\r\nThe rapidity of the fire from the Snider rifles was a surprise to all\r\nthe spectators.\r\n\r\nOn the 9th the chief and I having ridden up to Yedo in the morning, he\r\nhad an important interview at Hama-goten, the sea-side palace of the\r\nShôguns, with Iwakura. Kido, Higashi-Kuzé and Machida were also present.\r\nMany compliments were offered to Sir Harry, and assurances of the\r\ngratitude which the Mikado's government felt for the hearty recognition\r\nthey had received from Great Britain. To this succeeded some\r\nconfidential conversation. It was intended that the Mikado should return\r\nto Kiôto to be married, and also for the performance of certain funeral\r\nrites in honour of his late father. When these ceremonies were completed\r\nhe would come again to his Eastern Capital to hold a great council of\r\nthe empire. The date of this was not yet fixed; it might be in the first\r\nmonth of the Japanese calendar, perhaps in the third. Sir Harry advised\r\nIwakura to notify this to all the Foreign Representatives. The question\r\nof foreign neutrality and the situation at Hakodaté were then discussed.\r\nIwakura denounced very eloquently those of the ministers who, while\r\nrecognising the Mikado as sovereign, granted the status of belligerents\r\nto the Hakodaté pirates. Sir Harry declared for himself and the French\r\nMinister, Outrey, that no neutrality existed, and that they did not\r\nrecognize Enomoto and his associates as belligerents; nor did van\r\nPolsbroek. To this Iwakura responded: \"Why does the American Minister\r\nstill allege a declaration of neutrality as the ground of his refusal to\r\nhand over the 'Stonewall Jackson' to the lawful government?\" Sir Harry\r\nreplied that the declaration in question had been of very great service\r\nto the Mikado's government, that but for its existence Enomoto would now\r\nbe in possession of the iron-clad ram, and that he himself had been\r\nmainly instrumental in procuring the signature of that document. This\r\nwas quite true. An excellent lunch was served from the hotel, and we\r\nparted from our hosts just at sundown, both parties well satisfied with\r\neach other.\r\n\r\nI went on the 10th January to visit Siddall at his hospital on the other\r\nside of the city; there I found Willis, who on the way there from\r\nTsukiji, the foreign Settlement, had been threatened by a swash-buckler.\r\nWe discussed together the means by which the Japanese government might\r\nbe induced to apply for the services of Willis for a year in order to\r\nassist them in establishing their general hospital. So we told Ishigami\r\nthat Siddall was to be recalled to the Legation, and that Higashi-Kuzé\r\nmust ask for Willis. The Mikado had presented Willis with seven rolls of\r\nbeautiful gold brocade, and Higashi-Kuzé wrote a nice letter thanking\r\nthe dear old fellow for his services to the Japanese wounded warriors.\r\n\r\nOn January 12 we heard that the \"Kaiyô-Maru\" had sailed from Hakodaté,\r\nwith her rudder lashed to her stern; her destination was supposed to be\r\nEsashi, where fighting was going on. It was believed that the pirates\r\nwere running short of money and rice. The Ainos were reported to have\r\njoined the people of Matsumae in resisting the pirates.\r\n\r\nI had some interesting conversation with Ikébé Goi, whom I went to see\r\non the 13th. At his lodgings I met a young man named Yoshida Magoichirô,\r\na councillor of the Yanagawa clan. We talked about Christianity, and\r\nIkébé cited the Sermon on the Mount as a composition that pleased him\r\nmore than anything written by Buddhist or Confucian Sages. I remarked\r\nthat the Christian religion reversed the Chinese saying: \"Do not unto\r\nothers as ye would not that others should do unto you\"; upon which he\r\nquoted the command to turn the other cheek to be smitten. After a little\r\nhe began to talk about my chief's violence in conference, and said: \"Now\r\nin his case, when he gets in a rage, so far from offering the other\r\ncheek, I feel inclined to kick him out of the room.\" Ikébé said that the\r\nMikado would leave for Kiôto about the 17th or 18th January, and that a\r\nnotification had been issued announcing his departure during the first\r\ndecade of the 12th month, to return again in the spring.\r\n\r\nOn the morning of the 15th I was summoned by the chief to Yokohama in a\r\ngreat hurry to attend a conference between Iwakura and the foreign\r\ncolleagues. I rode the 20 miles on my pony \"Fushimi,\" in two hours and a\r\nhalf without drawing bridle, and arrived at the Legation to find the\r\nconference just assembling. Iwakura addressed to the colleagues pretty\r\nmuch the same arguments as he had made use of at Hama-goten on the 9th.\r\nThey put a number of questions to him by way of reply, and at last said\r\nthey could not give answer to so important a matter as he had laid\r\nbefore them without mature consideration. Iwakura then said that he\r\nwould take the opportunity of saying a few words about the causes of the\r\nexisting political situation. The present Mikado was the descendant of\r\nsovereigns who ruled the country more than 2000 years back; the\r\nShôgunate was an institution not more than 700 years old. Still, the\r\npower had been in its hands, and it was during the continuance of its\r\nauthority that the Americans came to the country in 1853. The Shôgun's\r\npeople were sharp enough to see the necessity and advantage of entering\r\ninto relations with foreign countries, while the Mikado's Court,\r\nfollowed by the greater part of the nation, professed the anti-foreign\r\npolicy. The country thus became disturbed, and the authority of the\r\nShôgun could no longer be maintained. Then both the Mikado and the\r\nShôgun died, and the latter's successor, a man of ability, was able to\r\nsee the absolute indispensability of a government directed by the\r\nMikado. Sincerely convinced of this, he surrendered the power into the\r\nhands of the Mikado, not as a mere gift, but because it was the only way\r\nof solving the political difficulties which existed. Thereupon the\r\nMikado's government changed its policy with regard to foreigners, and\r\ndid what never could have been done under the late sovereign, that is,\r\nentered into relations with the Treaty Powers. Hitherto our relations\r\nhad been merely commercial, but the government hoped that they would\r\nimprove and become something like those which existed among European and\r\nother civilized nations. The foreign ministers replied that they would\r\nconsult together, and send him a reply without delay.\r\n\r\nSir Harry came up on the 19th from Yokohama to tell Iwakura the result\r\nof yesterday's conference of colleagues on the subject of neutrality. We\r\nwere to have met him at Hama-goten, but when we got there we found the\r\ngates shut, and since no orders had been received to admit us, we came\r\naway. As we were returning to the Legation Mori came after us in a great\r\nhurry, and begged the chief to turn back, but he refused, and said\r\nIwakura might come to see him. This message was misunderstood by Mori,\r\nand there was more delay, but at last everything was arranged, and\r\nIwakura came at half-past seven to the Legation, accompanied by\r\nHigashi-Kuzé. Iwakura had sent through Mori to ask me to come to Yedo,\r\nin order that he might speak to me personally, but I took no notice of\r\nthis request, treating it merely as an invitation to the chief, or\r\nrather as a request to me to be present on the 19th in order to perform\r\ninterpretation. He asked Sir Harry what had been the result of the\r\nconference of foreign ministers, and all he could say was that it had\r\nbeen adjourned. It appeared that the colleagues were willing to make a\r\ndeclaration that the war was over, but were not willing to give up the\r\n\"Stonewall Jackson\"; and that in order to justify her retention they\r\nwould not withdraw their notifications of neutrality. To us this\r\nappeared highly illogical. The chief, after Iwakura had repeated all his\r\narguments and had added that so far from desiring to get hold of the\r\n\"Stonewall\" in order to attack Enomoto, the Mikado's government were\r\ndetermined to offer him lenient terms, declared that in his own opinion\r\nthe war had ceased, and that the neutrality lapsed with it; and that he\r\nwas ready to state this in writing. Iwakura said that the Mikado was\r\nvery desirous of knowing the answers of the ministers, and had therefore\r\nordered him to stop behind for five days in order to try to settle this\r\nquestion and to rejoin him at Shimidzu, a port on the Tôkaidô, that he\r\nwould like to get Sir Harry's answer confidentially, so that the Mikado\r\nmight have a pleasant souvenir to carry away with him. Another thing\r\nIwakura said was that the Mikado's government had made a sufficient\r\ndisplay of power by reducing the provinces of Oshiû and Déwa in six\r\nmonths, whereas in former wars twelve years had been nothing\r\nextraordinary; that their intention was to adopt a humane line of\r\nconduct, and they had therefore ordered the two Tokugawas of Sumpu and\r\nMito to proceed against the remaining rebels, and if they succeeded in\r\narranging matters Keiki would be pardoned and restored to favour. He had\r\nhimself seen Katsu, who believed that the offer of lenient terms would\r\ninduce submission. The Mikado's government would not however consider\r\nany capitulation satisfactory that was not accompanied by a complete\r\nsurrender of arms and ships of war. If the rebels proved obstinate they\r\nmust be reduced by force. This frank statement drew out a favourable\r\nreply from Sir Harry. Iwakura also appeared to be alarmed about the\r\nattitude of Russia, and asked whether she might not possibly enter into\r\nan alliance with Enomoto. The chief thought this unlikely. The interview\r\nlasted three hours, and ended with many thanks from Iwakura and\r\napologies for having kept Sir Harry waiting at the gate of Hama-goten.\r\nThe chief on his side undertook to do everything possible to bring his\r\ncolleagues round to his view and to induce them to send in their answer\r\nby the 25th, and he engaged to publish his own reply in the \"Japan\r\nHerald\" of the same day; that would be as decisive a manifestation of\r\nhis policy as he could possibly give. I was greatly pleased myself to\r\nfind that he had now made up his mind to \"go the whole hog.\"\r\n\r\nThe Mikado passed through Takanawa about eight o'clock the following\r\nmorning, on his way back to Kiôto. His train appeared to be smaller than\r\non the occasion of his entry. News arrived from Hakodaté on January 21\r\nthat the \"Kaiyô-maru\" had got on the rocks near Esashi and was expected\r\nto stick there; her guns had been thrown overboard and buoyed.\r\n\r\nThe sentences on Aidzu and Sendai were promulgated on the 21st, with the\r\npenalties inflicted on other _daimiôs_ of the northern provinces, and a\r\nfew more who had held out to the last. The Aidzu princes were let off\r\nwith their lives, but the whole of their territories were confiscated.\r\nSendai was reduced from 625,000 to 280,000 _koku_. The reigning prince\r\nwas made to retire into private life, and was succeeded by a son of our\r\nold friend, the Daté of Uwajima.\r\n\r\nOn the 22nd a further conference of the ministers was held with\r\nreference to the question of withdrawing the declarations of neutrality,\r\nand the little Italian minister, who came up to Yedo on the 23rd,\r\nassured us that only Sir Harry and Polsbroek were willing to consent,\r\nthe others having refused. Letters however arrived from Sir Harry\r\nshowing that all the colleagues had agreed to write a _note identique_\r\nacknowledging that the war was over, but demanding a short delay in\r\norder to concert measures for the simultaneous withdrawal of their\r\nnotifications. Also a note from him instructing me to arrange an\r\ninterview with Iwakura for Adams and Montebello (Secretary of the French\r\nLegation) in order that they might hand to him the petition which the\r\nTokugawa rebels at Hakodaté had asked M. Outrey and Sir Harry to forward\r\nto the Mikado. The translation of this document was made and sent off at\r\nonce. Then, after learning from Higashi-Kuzé that 2 o'clock was fixed\r\nfor the interview, Mitford and I went off to Kido, to whom I gave a copy\r\nof the _note identique_ about neutrality. He at once pitched on the\r\n'short delay' clause as unsatisfactory, but I could only give him my\r\nopinion that this was inserted as a sort of compromise; it was better, I\r\nsaid, for the Mikado's government that all the ministers should agree to\r\nrecognise that the war was over, even with this slight drawback, than\r\nthat only two of them should have recognised the fact and the other four\r\nhave continued to declare themselves neutral. A memorandum reached us\r\nfrom Adams stating the nature of the final arrangement, and suggesting\r\nthat the government should make it generally known by publishing the\r\ncorrespondence in their official Gazette. Then I went off to\r\nHigashi-Kuzé's place, to meet Adams, Montebello and Dubousquet,[11] who\r\narrived there about a quarter past two. Proceedings began by Montebello\r\nhanding in Outrey's copy of the _note identique_; Iwakura at once\r\npointed out the sentence in the letters of the English and French\r\nministers which spoke of 'a short delay,' and asked what was its\r\nmeaning. Both Adams and Montebello replied that they had no authority to\r\nsay anything on this point, but they undertook at his request to write\r\nto their chiefs, and obtain if possible a definite date. I also\r\nwhispered to Yamaguchi Hanzô to tell Iwakura afterwards that Kido\r\nalready knew all about the compromise. The business of handing over the\r\npetition of the Tokugawa rebels was then proceeded with. Iwakura was\r\ntold that in delivering this document the ministers did not offer any\r\nopinion on its contents, and they renounced for themselves any idea of\r\nacting as mediators; but that as the Japanese Foreign Minister had\r\nexpressed to both of them his desire to learn if possible the feelings\r\nand intentions of the fugitives, they were very glad to have this\r\nopportunity of complying with his request.\r\n\r\n    [11] An officer of the French Military Mission who devoted\r\n        himself to the study of the Japanese language, and\r\n        ultimately became interpreter to the French Legation.\r\n\r\nIwakura replied that these men had now been declared to be rebels, and\r\nthe two clans of Mito and Sumpu had been ordered out against them. That\r\nthe proper course to adopt in presenting the petition which he had just\r\nread was to send it through the chiefs of those two clans. From the\r\nhasty glance he had cast over the document he could not profess to judge\r\nof its merits, but he was glad to see that the petitioners had some\r\ndesire, however slight, of returning to their allegiance. (But if he had\r\nbeen aware of the extreme bumptiousness of the letter to Parkes and\r\nOutrey in which the petitions were forwarded, he would hardly have\r\nthought so.) Still, while thanking the ministers, and appreciating the\r\ndisinterestedness of their motives, he could not consent to receive the\r\npetition through such a channel. Would the ministers mind forwarding it\r\nthrough the Tokugawa clan?\r\n\r\nAdams and Montebello declined to have any business relations with the\r\nclan, and after some urging from the French side, Iwakura said he would\r\naccept the petition temporarily and give his answer to-morrow. We then\r\nreturned home and Adams despatched a report to the chief. Next day (the\r\n25th) in the afternoon came fresh instructions. Adams was to go to\r\nIwakura, inform him of the surprise felt by both ministers at the\r\nrefusal to accept the petition, and state that the expression 'a short\r\ndelay' in the _note identique_ respecting neutrality meant what it said.\r\nAfter consultation with Montebello, it was decided to ask for an\r\ninterview with Iwakura at 10 o'clock on the morning of the 26th, and a\r\nletter to that effect was sent off to Higashi-Kuzé. Before an answer\r\ncould be received at the Legations there came a letter from Yamaguchi\r\nHanzô written by Iwakura's order, refusing to accept the petition, and\r\nsaying that as he was going down to Yokohama next day to see the\r\nrepresentatives on the subject of neutrality, he would take the\r\nopportunity of speaking to the two ministers about the other matter as\r\nwell. However Higashi-Kuzé's reply to our letter soon arrived to say\r\nthat Iwakura's departure was postponed for a day, and that he would see\r\nthe two secretaries as proposed by them.\r\n\r\nOn the 26th, as I was unwell, Mitford went in my stead to interpret for\r\nAdams. Iwakura receded from his previous attitude, and declared himself\r\nready to receive the petition from the two ministers, but that he\r\nintended to return it to the Tokugawa fugitives without taking any\r\nnotice of its contents. Further, that he was determined to demand from\r\nthe ministers the meaning of the words 'a short delay.' He also\r\naddressed a letter to the two ministers thanking them for the trouble\r\nthey had taken about the petition, which he characterized as\r\nimpertinent; it would therefore have to be returned direct. This was a\r\nslap in the face for our two chiefs, who ought never to have presented\r\nthe petition, considering the covering letters received by them, which\r\nthreatened to throw down the gauntlet to the Mikado's government if it\r\ndid not leave them in quiet possession of Yezo. But Sir Harry was drawn\r\non by the fear that Outrey would manage to get the petition accepted,\r\nand thereby win prestige; but if so, Outrey's little game was frustrated\r\nby Iwakura's good luck or perspicacity.\r\n\r\nThe following day I had to rush down to Yokohama for Iwakura's meeting\r\nwith the Foreign Representatives. He asked what they meant by 'a short\r\ntime.' They appeared to him to have had time enough already. When\r\nissuing their original notifications of neutrality they had acted\r\nimmediately on receiving the communication of the Mikado's government,\r\nand why hesitate now? The colleagues fenced a little with the question\r\nand then retired into another room to consider their answer. When they\r\nemerged they announced their readiness to issue proclamations in\r\nfourteen days' time at the furthest. With this Iwakura was forced to be\r\ncontent. But our chief had gained the battle, and was correspondingly\r\nrejoiced. Iwakura left the same afternoon in the \"Keangsoo\"[12] for the\r\nport of Toba in Shima. Higashi-Kuzé informed the ministers that Yedo was\r\nto be the capital of the country, after the Mikado's return there next\r\nJapanese New-Year, but this decision was not at present to be made\r\npublic. He displayed a map of the city and offered them the whole\r\nwaterside from the Kanasugi Bridge to the Hotel, except the Owari\r\n_yashiki_, where the Foreign Office was to be, for sites on which to\r\nbuild Legations. All but Sir Harry declared their unwillingness to\r\naccept sites; I remarked to myself that he was gradually getting out of\r\nthe bad habit of believing all the Japanese told him to be lies.\r\n\r\n    [12] Originally the flagship of Captain Sherard Osborn, when in\r\n        command of the Chinese flotilla brought out by H. N. Lay,\r\n        and afterwards bought by Satsuma.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XXXVI\r\n\r\n               LAST DAYS IN TOKIO AND DEPARTURE FOR HOME\r\n\r\n\r\nA WEEK before this Iwakura had sent me a present of a beautiful\r\nlacquered cabinet by way of thanks for the trouble he said I had taken\r\nin interpreting for him on various occasions, and on January 28th when I\r\nreturned to Yedo I found a letter from Saméshima Seizô with presents\r\nfrom the Prince of Satsuma, Okubo, Yoshii and himself. The letter said:\r\n\"Prince Satsuma wishes me to give you his thanks for your kindness and\r\nthe trouble you have hitherto taken for his sake. He presents you the\r\ntwo boxes, and the rest, though a little, Okubo, Ioxy and myself present\r\nyou merely to thank you for your kindness. We hope you will always keep\r\nthem as our memorial.\" The prince's present consisted of a silver boat\r\nin the form of a peacock (called Takara-buné, or Ship of Treasures) and\r\nthe lacquered stand, besides two rolls of white silk; Yoshii sent two\r\npieces of Kiyo-midzu porcelain, and each of the others two pieces of\r\nwhite satin brocade. The spelling Ioxy, which is in accordance with\r\nancient Portuguese orthography of Japanese names, shows that this letter\r\ncame in English.\r\n\r\nMy translation of the sentences of the northern _daimiôs_ was published\r\nin the \"Japan Herald\" of January 30. This state paper completed the\r\ndiscomfiture of the _som-bak-ka_ diplomats, the term invented by the\r\nJapanese for application to the foreign ministers who supported the\r\ncause of the Shôgunate as far as was possible for them.\r\n\r\nFebruary 11 was the Japanese New Year's Day, which I passed at Yedo.\r\nRice-cakes (_mochi_) had been prepared and decorated in proper fashion\r\nwith a Seville orange and fern, and dried fronds had also been hung up\r\nin the alcove (_toko no ma_) of my study. Silk cushions had been\r\nprovided for a guest and myself to sit on as we ate our _zôni_. This is\r\na soup in which pieces of fried _mochi_ are soaked; on the first day of\r\nthe year one is eaten, on the second two, on the third three. A New\r\nYear's drink called _toso_ was also provided; this is a sweet _saké_\r\nmingled with spices; it is drunk from porcelain cups of gradually\r\ndecreasing size, placed on a stand. Every member of the household came\r\nin turn to wish me a happy new year, and to thank me for the _O Sébo_,\r\nor presents given to them at the end of the year, proportioned to the\r\nrespective merits of the different servants. Next evening I gave an\r\nentertainment to my Japanese escort, to which the Legation writer Ono\r\nSeigórô, Mitford's teacher Nagazawa and my household were also invited.\r\nMitford and I sat on white brocade cushions at the head of the room,\r\nwith a big lacquered brazier between us; the Japanese guests were ranged\r\nalong both sides of the room and at the end. I had to apologize by way\r\nof form for sitting on a cushion, which as host I ought not to have\r\ndone, under the pretence that it made my knees sore to squat on the\r\nmats. There was a great deal of stiff conversation at first, until the\r\n_saké_ was brought, and the waiting women from the restaurant that\r\nsupplied the dinner, the _geishas_, Noguchi's wife and a very clever\r\ngirl from Yokohama made their appearance. We had comic dances, charades,\r\nsongs and the Manzai new year's dance. An immense quantity of _saké_ was\r\ndrunk, and every one departed well pleased by twelve o'clock.\r\n\r\nAlexander Siebold, who had been in France with Mimbu Taiyu, had at last\r\narrived back in Japan, releasing me from the duties that had kept me two\r\nyears longer than provided by the existing rules about leave of absence.\r\nOn February 14 he and I went to call on Katsu, who had been such a\r\nvaluable source of political information ever since the downfall of the\r\nShôgunate. Katsu thought the Tokugawa rebels at Hakodaté would give in\r\ntheir submission. At parting he gave me his _wakizashi_ (short sword),\r\nand we separated with many mutual expressions of regret. He was\r\nquartered in an outhouse at the Ki-shiû _yashiki_, where old Takénouchi,\r\na Ki-shiû retainer who had been our purveyor of news and papers current\r\namong the _daimiô yashikis_, was also living; we had to go into his\r\nrooms and drink a cup of tea; there I found the secretary of Daté Gorô,\r\na distinguished Ki-shiû official, to whom I sent my farewell\r\ncompliments. We got back to my house just in time to rush off again, to\r\na dinner at the hotel, given by Higashi-Kuzé in honour of my departure.\r\nBesides Mitford, Siebold and myself, the other guests were the Prince of\r\nBizen, the Court Noble Ohara Jijiû, Kido, Machida, Mori (afterwards\r\nknown as Mori Arinori), Kanda Kôhei a professor at the School of\r\nLanguages and editor of one of the recently established Yedo newspapers,\r\nand Tsudzuki Shôzô of Uwajima. It was a very pleasant party. Little\r\nBizen greeted me very politely, said he had heard a great deal about me,\r\nbut had not had a previous opportunity of meeting me, so had taken\r\nadvantage of this farewell entertainment to make my acquaintance. I had\r\nthe post of honour at the left of Higashi-Kuzé. After dinner they drank\r\nmy health in bumpers of champagne and wished me a pleasant voyage. Every\r\none had some commission to give me. The Japanese government wanted six\r\nexpensive gold watches and chains. Tsudzuki Shôzô, who presented me with\r\na farewell letter written in the name of old Daté, asked for a copy of\r\nHertslet's Treaties. Besides parting gifts from the Prince of Satsuma,\r\nOkubo, Yoshii and Saméshima, I received presents from Machida, my\r\nJapanese escort men, and a host of other people, including Kido. The\r\nlatter spoke to me confidentially after dinner about the advantages\r\nwhich would result to Japan from opening a port in Corea; not so much\r\nmaterial as moral, by teaching the Coreans to look abroad outside their\r\nown country. Both he and Mori talked about the native Christians and\r\nasked my advice. I counselled moderate measures, and long Notes to the\r\nForeign Ministers now and then to keep them quiet. I acknowledged the\r\ndifficulty of instilling the idea of toleration into the minds of the\r\nwhole Japanese people by Act of Parliament, and told them of the\r\ndisabilities under which Protestants had lain in Spain until recently,\r\nbut I did not see the advantage of Mori's suggestion of allotting lands\r\nin Yezo to the Christians with the free exercise of their religion.\r\nTsudzuki confided to me as a great secret the intended visit to England\r\nof a young Bizen _karô_ named Tokura. Altogether we spent a very\r\nsatisfactory evening, in spite of the long distance we had to go for our\r\ndinner.\r\n\r\nNext day I left Yedo for good. As I passed the entrance to the barracks\r\nof the Legation mounted escort of London policemen, Inspector Peacock\r\nand the men came out to wish me a pleasant journey. Noguchi, Mitford's\r\nteacher Nagazawa and four of my Japanese guard came down the road as far\r\nas Mmé-yashiki, where we had a parting cup. Higashi-Kuzé sent me a\r\ncomplimentary letter, regretting my departure, and presenting me with a\r\nbig lacquered cabinet as a mark of the Mikado's appreciation of all I\r\nhad done to smooth diplomatic relations. Kido also wrote, asking me to\r\ncommunicate to him any information about Japanese affairs that I might\r\npick up in Europe, promising to answer any letters I might send him,\r\nwishing me a fine voyage and a happy arrival in England.\r\n\r\nOn the 24th February I sailed from Yokohama in the P. and O. steamer\r\n\"Ottawa,\" 814 tons, master Edmond. Lady Parkes also was on board on her\r\nway to England, and the English community paid her the compliment of\r\nsending out a band, which played \"Home, sweet home\" as the anchor was\r\nweighed. I felt the tears come into my eyes. It would be hard to say\r\nwhether they were caused by the emotion that a much-loved piece of music\r\nalways produces, or by regret at leaving a country where I had lived so\r\nhappily for six years and a half. With me I had my faithful Aidzu\r\n_samurai_, Noguchi Tomizô.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                       GLOSSARY OF JAPANESE WORDS\r\n\r\n\r\n    akéni, a wicker trunk for luggage.\r\n\r\n    anata, you.\r\n\r\n    arimasu, is, there is.\r\n\r\n    ashigaru, common soldier in the service of a baron.\r\n\r\n    awabi, rocksucker, a species of univalve shell-fish, haliotis\r\n    japonicus, which furnishes also mother-of-pearl.\r\n\r\n\r\n    bai-shin, arrière vassal.\r\n\r\n    baku-fu, 'military power,' term applied to the _de facto_\r\n    government by its adversaries.
