GEORGE CLARK HUTTON, D.D.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis History of the Reformation has been written with the intention of\r\ndescribing a great religious movement amid its social environment. The\r\ntimes were heroic, and produced great men, with striking individualities\r\nnot easily weighed in modern balances. The age is sufficiently remote to\r\ncompel us to remember that while the morality of one century can be judged\r\nby another, the men who belong to it must be judged by the standard of\r\ntheir contemporaries, and not altogether by ours. The religious revival\r\nwas set in a framework of political, intellectual, and economic changes,\r\nand cannot be disentangled from its surroundings without danger of\r\nmutilation. All these things add to the difficulty of description.\r\n\r\nMy excuse, if excuse be needed, for venturing on the task is that the\r\nperiod is one to which I have devoted special attention for many years,\r\nand that I have read and re-read most of the original contemporary sources\r\nof information. While full use has been made of the labours of\r\npredecessors in the same field, no chapter in the volume, save that on the\r\npolitical condition of Europe, has been written without constant reference\r\nto contemporary evidence.\r\n\r\nA History of the Reformation, it appears to me, must describe five\r\ndistinct but related things—the social and religious conditions of the age\r\nout of which the great movement came; the Lutheran Reformation down to\r\n1555, when it received legal recognition; the Reformation in countries\r\nbeyond Germany which did not submit to the guidance of Luther; the issue\r\nof certain portions of the religious life of the Middle Ages in\r\nAnabaptism, Socinianism, and Anti-Trinitarianism; and, finally, the\r\nCounter-Reformation.\r\n\r\nThe second follows the first in natural succession; but the third was\r\nalmost contemporary with the second. If the Reformation won its way to\r\nlegal recognition earlier in Germany than in any other land, its\r\nbeginnings in France, England, and perhaps the Netherlands, had appeared\r\nbefore Luther had published his _Theses_. I have not found it possible to\r\ndescribe all the five in chronological order.\r\n\r\nThis volume describes the eve of the Reformation and the movement itself\r\nunder the guidance of Luther. In a second volume I hope to deal with the\r\nReformation beyond Germany, with Anabaptism, Socinianism, and kindred\r\nmatters which had their roots far back in the Middle Ages, and with the\r\nCounter-Reformation.\r\n\r\nThe first part of this volume deals with the intellectual, social, and\r\nreligious life of the age which gave birth to the Reformation. The\r\nintellectual life of the times has been frequently described, and its\r\neconomic conditions are beginning to attract attention. But few have cared\r\nto investigate popular and family religious life in the decades before the\r\ngreat revival. Yet for the history of the Reformation movement nothing can\r\nbe more important. When it is studied, it can be seen that the evangelical\r\nrevival was not a unique phenomenon, entirely unconnected with the\r\nimmediate past. There was a continuity in the religious life of the\r\nperiod. The same hymns were sung in public and in private after the\r\nReformation which had been in use before Luther raised the standard of\r\nrevolt. Many of the prayers in the Reformation liturgies came from the\r\nservice-books of the mediæval Church. Much of the family instruction in\r\nreligious matters received by the Reformers when they were children was in\r\nturn taught by them to the succeeding generation. The great Reformation\r\nhad its roots in the simple evangelical piety which had never entirely\r\ndisappeared in the mediæval Church. Luther’s teaching was recognised by\r\nthousands to be no startling novelty, but something which they had always\r\nat heart believed, though they might not have been able to formulate it.\r\nIt is true that Luther and his fellow-Reformers taught their generation\r\nthat Our Lord, Jesus Christ, filled the whole sphere of God, and that\r\nother mediators and intercessors were superfluous, and that they also\r\ndelivered it from the fear of a priestly caste; but men did not receive\r\nthat teaching as entirely new; they rather accepted it as something they\r\nhad always felt, though they had not been able to give their feelings due\r\nand complete expression. It is true that this simple piety had been set in\r\na framework of superstition, and that the Church had been generally looked\r\nupon as an institution within which priests exercised a secret science of\r\nredemption through their power over the sacraments; but the old\r\nevangelical piety existed, and its traces can be found when sought for.\r\n\r\nA portion of the chapter which describes the family and popular religious\r\nlife immediately preceding the Reformation has already appeared in the\r\n_London Quarterly Review_ for October 1903.\r\n\r\nIn describing the beginnings of the Lutheran Reformation, I have had to go\r\nover the same ground covered by my chapter on “Luther” contributed to the\r\nsecond volume of the _Cambridge Modern History_, and have found it\r\nimpossible not to repeat myself. This is specially the case with the\r\naccount given of the theory and practice of Indulgences. It ought to be\r\nsaid, however, that in view of certain strictures on the earlier work by\r\nRoman Catholic reviewers, I have gone over again the statements made about\r\nIndulgences by the great mediæval theologians of the thirteenth and\r\nfifteenth centuries, and have not been able to change the opinions\r\npreviously expressed.\r\n\r\nMy thanks are due to my colleague, Dr. Denney, and to another friend for\r\nthe care they have taken in revising the proof-sheets, and for many\r\nvaluable suggestions which have been given effect to.\r\n\r\nThomas M. Lindsay.\r\n\r\n_March, 1906._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK I. ON THE EVE OF THE REFORMATION.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter I. The Papacy.(1)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 1. Claim to Universal Supremacy.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe long struggle between the Mediæval Church and the Mediæval Empire,\r\nbetween the priest and the warrior,(2) ended, in the earlier half of the\r\nthirteenth century, in the overthrow of the Hohenstaufens, and left the\r\nPapacy sole inheritor of the claim of ancient Rome to be sovereign of the\r\ncivilised world.\r\n\r\n\r\n    _Roma caput mundi regit orbis frena rotundi._\r\n\r\n\r\nStrong and masterful Popes had for centuries insisted on exercising powers\r\nwhich, they asserted, belonged to them as the successors of St. Peter and\r\nthe representatives of Christ upon earth. Ecclesiastical jurists had\r\ntranslated their assertions into legal language, and had expressed them in\r\nprinciples borrowed from the old imperial law. Precedents, needed by the\r\nlegal mind to unite the past with the present, had been found in a series\r\nof imaginary papal judgments extending over past centuries. The forged\r\ndecretals of the pseudo-Isidor (used by Pope Nicholas I. in his letter of\r\n866 A.D. to the bishops of Gaul), of the group of canonists who supported\r\nthe pretensions of Pope Gregory VII. (1073-1085),—Anselm of Lucca,\r\nDeusdedit, Cardinal Bonzio, and Gregory of Pavia,—gave to the papal claims\r\nthe semblance of the sanction of antiquity. The Decretum of Gratian,\r\nissued in 1150 from Bologna, then the most famous Law School in Europe,\r\nincorporated all these earlier forgeries and added new ones. It displaced\r\nthe older collections of Canon Law and became the starting-point for\r\nsucceeding canonists. Its mosaic of facts and falsehoods formed the basis\r\nfor the theories of the imperial powers and of the universal jurisdiction\r\nof the Bishops of Rome.(3)\r\n\r\nThe picturesque religious background of this conception of the Church of\r\nChrist as a great temporal empire had been furnished by St. Augustine,\r\nalthough probably he would have been the first to protest against the use\r\nmade of his vision of the City of God. His unfinished masterpiece, _De\r\nCivitate Dei_, in which with a devout and glowing imagination he had\r\ncontrasted the _Civitas Terrena_, or the secular State founded on conquest\r\nand maintained by fraud and violence, with the Kingdom of God, which he\r\nidentified with the visible ecclesiastical society, had filled the\r\nimagination of all Christians in the days immediately preceding the\r\ndissolution of the Roman Empire of the West, and had contributed in a\r\nremarkable degree to the final overthrow of the last remains of a cultured\r\npaganism. It became the sketch outline which the jurists of the Roman\r\nCuria gradually filled in with details by their strictly defined and\r\nlegally expressed claim of the Roman Pontiff to a universal jurisdiction.\r\nIts living but poetically indefinite ideas were transformed into clearly\r\ndefined legal principles found ready-made in the all-embracing\r\njurisprudence of the ancient empire, and were analysed and exhibited in\r\ndefinite claims to rule and to judge in every department of human\r\nactivity. When poetic thoughts, which from their very nature stretch\r\nforward towards and melt in the infinite, are imprisoned within legal\r\nformulas and are changed into principles of practical jurisprudence, they\r\nlose all their distinctive character, and the creation which embodies them\r\nbecomes very different from what it was meant to be. The mischievous\r\nactivity of the Roman canonists actually transformed the _Civitas Dei_ of\r\nthe glorious vision of St. Augustine into that _Civitas Terrena_ which he\r\nreprobated, and the ideal Kingdom of God became a vulgar earthly monarchy,\r\nwith all the accompaniments of conquest, fraud, and violence which,\r\naccording to the great theologian of the West, naturally belonged to such\r\na society. But the glamour of the City of God long remained to dazzle the\r\neyes of gifted and pious men during the earlier Middle Ages, when they\r\ncontemplated the visible ecclesiastical empire ruled by the Bishop of\r\nRome.\r\n\r\nThe requirements of the practical religion of everyday life were also\r\nbelieved to be in the possession of this ecclesiastical monarchy to give\r\nand to withhold. For it was the almost universal belief of mediæval piety\r\nthat the mediation of a priest was essential to salvation; and the\r\npriesthood was an integral part of this monarchy, and did not exist\r\noutside its boundaries. “No good Catholic Christian doubted that in\r\nspiritual things the clergy were the divinely appointed superiors of the\r\nlaity, that this power proceeded from the right of the priests to\r\ncelebrate the sacraments, that the Pope was the real possessor of this\r\npower, and was far superior to all secular authority.”(4) In the decades\r\nimmediately preceding the Reformation, many an educated man might have\r\ndoubts about this power of the clergy over the spiritual and eternal\r\nwelfare of men and women; but when it came to the point, almost no one\r\ncould venture to say that there was nothing in it. And so long as the\r\nfeeling remained that there might be something in it, the anxieties, to\r\nsay the least, which Christian men and women could not help having when\r\nthey looked forward to an unknown future, made kings and peoples hesitate\r\nbefore they offered defiance to the Pope and the clergy. The spiritual\r\npowers which were believed to come from the exclusive possession of\r\npriesthood and sacraments went for much in increasing the authority of the\r\npapal empire and in binding it together in one compact whole.\r\n\r\nIn the earlier Middle Ages the claims of the Papacy to universal supremacy\r\nhad been urged and defended by ecclesiastical jurists alone; but in the\r\nthirteenth century theology also began to state them from its own point of\r\nview. Thomas Aquinas set himself to prove that submission to the Roman\r\nPontiff was necessary for every human being. He declared that, under the\r\nlaw of the New Testament, the king must be subject to the priest to the\r\nextent that, if kings proved to be heretics or schismatics, the Bishop of\r\nRome was entitled to deprive them of all kingly authority by releasing\r\nsubjects from their ordinary obedience.(5)\r\n\r\nThe fullest expression of this temporal and spiritual supremacy claimed by\r\nthe Bishops of Rome is to be found in Pope Innocent IV.’s _Commentary on\r\nthe Decretals_(6) (1243-1254), and in the Bull, _Unam Sanctam_, published\r\nby Pope Boniface VIII. in 1302. But succeeding Bishops of Rome in no way\r\nabated their pretensions to universal sovereignty. The same claims were\r\nmade during the Exile at Avignon and in the days of the Great Schism. They\r\nwere asserted by Pope Pius II. in his Bull, _Execrabilis et pristinis_\r\n(1459), and by Pope Leo X. on the very eve of the Reformation, in his\r\nBull, _Pastor Æternus_ (1516); while Pope Alexander VI. (Rodrigo Borgia),\r\nacting as the lord of the universe, made over the New World to Isabella of\r\nCastile and to Ferdinand of Aragon by legal deed of gift in his Bull,\r\n_Inter cætera divinæ_ (May 4th, 1493).(7)\r\n\r\nThe power claimed in these documents was a twofold supremacy, temporal and\r\nspiritual.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 2. The Temporal Supremacy.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe former, stated in its widest extent, was the right to depose kings,\r\nfree their subjects from their allegiance, and bestow their territories on\r\nanother. It could only be enforced when the Pope found a stronger\r\npotentate willing to carry out his orders, and was naturally but rarely\r\nexercised. Two instances, however, occurred not long before the\r\nReformation. George Podiebrod, the King of Bohemia, offended the Bishop of\r\nRome by insisting that the Roman See should keep the bargain made with his\r\nHussite subjects at the Council of Basel. He was summoned to Rome to be\r\ntried as a heretic by Pope Pius II. in 1464, and by Pope Paul II. in 1465,\r\nand was declared by the latter to be deposed; his subjects were released\r\nfrom their allegiance, and his kingdom was offered to Matthias Corvinus,\r\nthe King of Hungary, who gladly accepted the offer, and a protracted and\r\nbloody war was the consequence. Later still, in 1511, Pope Julius II.\r\nexcommunicated the King of Navarre, and empowered any neighbouring king to\r\nseize his dominions—an offer readily accepted by Ferdinand of Aragon.(8)\r\n\r\nIt was generally, however, in more indirect ways that this claim to\r\ntemporal supremacy, _i.e._ to direct the policy, and to be the final\r\narbiter in the actions of temporal sovereigns, made itself felt. A great\r\npotentate, placed over the loosely formed kingdoms of the Middle Ages,\r\nhesitated to provoke a contest with an authority which was able to give\r\nreligious sanction to the rebellion of powerful feudal nobles seeking a\r\nlegitimate pretext for defying him, or which could deprive his subjects of\r\nthe external consolations of religion by laying the whole or part of his\r\ndominions under an interdict. We are not to suppose that the exercise of\r\nthis claim of temporal supremacy was always an evil thing. Time after time\r\nthe actions and interference of right-minded Popes proved that the\r\ntemporal supremacy of the Bishop of Rome meant that moral considerations\r\nmust have due weight attached to them in the international affairs of\r\nEurope; and this fact, recognised and felt, accounted largely for much of\r\nthe practical acquiescence in the papal claims. But from the time when the\r\nPapacy became, on its temporal side, an Italian power, and when its\r\ninternational policy had for its chief motive to increase the political\r\nprestige of the Bishop of Rome within the Italian peninsula, the moral\r\nstandard of the papal court was hopelessly lowered, and it no longer had\r\neven the semblance of representing morality in the international affairs\r\nof Europe. The change may be roughly dated from the pontificate of Pope\r\nSixtus IV. (1471-1484), or from the birth of Luther (November 10th, 1483).\r\nThe possession of the Papacy gave this advantage to Sixtus over his\r\ncontemporaries in Italy, that he “was relieved of all ordinary\r\nconsiderations of decency, consistency, or prudence, because his position\r\nas Pope saved him from serious disaster.” The divine authority, assumed by\r\nthe Popes as the representatives of Christ upon earth, meant for Sixtus\r\nand his immediate successors that they were above the requirements of\r\ncommon morality, and had the right for themselves or for their allies to\r\nbreak the most solemn treaties when it suited their shifting policy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 3. The Spiritual Supremacy.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe ecclesiastical supremacy was gradually interpreted to mean that the\r\nBishop of Rome was the _one_ or universal bishop in whom all spiritual and\r\necclesiastical powers were summed up, and that all other members of the\r\nhierarchy were simply delegates selected by him for the purposes of\r\nadministration. On this interpretation, the Bishop of Rome was the\r\nabsolute monarch over a kingdom which was called spiritual, but which was\r\nas thoroughly material as were those of France, Spain, or England. For,\r\naccording to mediæval ideas, men were spiritual if they had taken orders,\r\nor were under monastic vows; fields, drains, and fences were spiritual\r\nthings if they were Church property; a house, a barn, or a byre was a\r\nspiritual thing, if it stood on land belonging to the Church. This papal\r\nkingdom, miscalled spiritual, lay scattered over Europe in diocesan lands,\r\nconvent estates, and parish glebes—interwoven in the web of the ordinary\r\nkingdoms and principalities of Europe. It was part of the Pope’s claim to\r\n_spiritual_ supremacy that his subjects (the clergy) owed no allegiance to\r\nthe monarch within whose territories they resided; that they lived outside\r\nthe sphere of civil legislation and taxation; and that they were under\r\nspecial laws imposed on them by their supreme spiritual ruler, and paid\r\ntaxes to him and to him alone. The claim to spiritual supremacy therefore\r\ninvolved endless interference with the rights of temporal sovereignty in\r\nevery country in Europe, and things civil and things sacred were so\r\ninextricably mixed that it is quite impossible to speak of the Reformation\r\nas a purely religious movement. It was also an endeavour to put an end to\r\nthe exemption of the Church and its possessions from all secular control,\r\nand to her constant encroachment on secular territory.\r\n\r\nTo show how this claim for spiritual supremacy trespassed continually on\r\nthe domain of secular authority and created a spirit of unrest all over\r\nEurope, we have only to look at its exercise in the matter of patronage to\r\nbenefices, to the way in which the common law of the Church interfered\r\nwith the special civil laws of European States, and to the increasing\r\nburden of papal requisitions of money.\r\n\r\nIn the case of bishops, the theory was that the dean and chapter elected,\r\nand that the bishop-elect had to be confirmed by the Pope. This procedure\r\nprovided for the selection locally of a suitable spiritual ruler, and also\r\nfor the supremacy of the head of the Church. The mediæval bishops,\r\nhowever, were temporal lords of great influence in the civil affairs of\r\nthe kingdom or principality within which their dioceses were placed, and\r\nit was naturally an object of interest to kings and princes to secure men\r\nwho would be faithful to themselves. Hence the tendency was for the civil\r\nauthorities to interfere more or less in episcopal appointments. This\r\nfrequently resulted in making these elections a matter of conflict between\r\nthe head of the Church in Rome and the head of the State in France,\r\nEngland, or Germany; in which case the rights of the dean and chapter were\r\ncommonly of small account. The contest was in the nature of things almost\r\ninevitable even when the civil and the ecclesiastical powers were actuated\r\nby the best motives, and when both sought to appoint men competent to\r\ndischarge the duties of the position with ability. But the best motives\r\nwere not always active. Diocesan rents were large, and the incomes of\r\nbishops made excellent provision for the favourite followers of kings and\r\nof Popes, and if the revenues of one see failed to express royal or papal\r\nfavour adequately, the favourite could be appointed to several sees at\r\nonce. Papal nepotism became a byword; but it ought to be remembered that\r\nkingly nepotism also existed. Pope Sixtus V. insisted on appointing a\r\nretainer of his nephew, Cardinal Giuliano della Rovere, to the see of\r\nModrus in Hungary, and after a contest of three years carried his point in\r\n1483; and Matthias Corvinus, King of Hungary, gave the archbishopric of\r\nGran to Ippolito d’Este, a youth under age, and after a two years’\r\nstruggle compelled the Pope to confirm the appointment in 1487.\r\n\r\nDuring the fourteenth century the Papacy endeavoured to obtain a more\r\ncomplete control over ecclesiastical appointments by means of the system\r\nof _Reservations_ which figures so largely in local ecclesiastical affairs\r\nto the discredit of the Papacy during the years before the Reformation.\r\nFor at least a century earlier, Popes had been accustomed to declare on\r\nvarious pretexts that certain benefices were _vacantes apud Sedem\r\nApostolicam_, which meant that the Bishop of Rome reserved the appointment\r\nfor himself. Pope John XXII. (1316-1334), founding on such previous\r\npractice, laid down a series of rules stating what benefices were to be\r\nreserved for the papal patronage. The ostensible reason for this\r\nlegislation was to prevent the growing evil of pluralities; but, as in all\r\ncases of papal lawmaking, these _Constitutiones Johanninæ_ had the effect\r\nof binding ecclesiastically all patrons but the Popes themselves. For the\r\nPopes always maintained that they alone were superior to the laws which\r\nthey made. They were _supra legem_ or _legibus absoluti_, and their\r\ndispensations could always set aside their legislation when it suited\r\ntheir purpose. Under these constitutions of Pope John XXII., when sees\r\nwere vacant owing to the invalidation of an election they were _reserved_\r\nto the Pope. Thus we find that there was a disputed election to the see of\r\nDunkeld in 1337, and after some years’ litigation at Rome the election was\r\nquashed, and Richard de Pilmor was appointed bishop _auctoritate\r\napostolica_. The see of Dunkeld was declared to be reserved to the Pope\r\nfor the appointment of the two succeeding bishops at least.(9) This system\r\nof _Reservations_ was gradually extended under the successors of Pope John\r\nXXII., and was applied to benefices of every kind all over Europe, until\r\nit would be difficult to say what piece of ecclesiastical preferment\r\nescaped the papal net. There exists in the town library in Trier a MS. of\r\nthe _Rules of the Roman Chancery_ on which someone has sketched the head\r\nof a Pope, with the legend issuing from the mouth, _Reservamus omnia_,\r\nwhich somewhat roughly represents the contents of the book. In the end,\r\nthe assertion was made that the Holy See owned all benefices, and, in the\r\nuniversal secularisation of the Church which the half century before the\r\nReformation witnessed, the very Rules of the Roman Chancery contained the\r\nlists of prices to be charged for various benefices, whether with or\r\nwithout cure of souls; and in completing the bargain the purchaser could\r\nalways procure a clause setting aside the civil rights of patrons.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, ecclesiastical preferments always implied the holders\r\nbeing liferented in lands and in monies, and the right to bestow these\r\ntemporalities was protected by the laws of most European countries. Thus\r\nthe ever-extending papal _reservations_ of benefices led to continual\r\nconflicts between the laws of the Church—in this case latterly the Rules\r\nof the Roman Chancery—and the laws of the European States. Temporal rulers\r\nsought to protect themselves and their subjects by statutes of _Præmunire_\r\nand others of a like kind,(10) or else made bargains with the Popes, which\r\ntook the form of _Concordats_, like that of Bourges (1438) and that of\r\nVienna (1448). Neither statutes nor bargains were of much avail against\r\nthe superior diplomacy of the Papacy, and the dread which its supposed\r\npossession of spiritual powers inspired in all classes of people. A\r\nConcordat was always represented by papal lawyers to be binding only so\r\nlong as the goodwill of the Pope maintained it; and there was a\r\ndeep-seated feeling throughout the peoples of Europe that the Church was,\r\nto use the language of the peasants of Germany, “the Pope’s House,” and\r\nthat he had a right to deal freely with its property. Pious and patriotic\r\nmen, like Gascoigne in England, deplored the evil effects of the papal\r\n_reservations_; but they saw no remedy unless the Almighty changed the\r\nheart of the Holy Father; and, after the failures of the Conciliar\r\nattempts at reform, a sullen hopelessness seemed to have taken possession\r\nof the minds of men, until Luther taught them that there was nothing in\r\nthe indefinable power that the Pope and the clergy claimed to possess over\r\nthe spiritual and eternal welfare of men and women.\r\n\r\nTo Pope John XXII. (1316-1334) belongs the credit or discredit of creating\r\nfor the Papacy a machinery for gathering in money for its support. His\r\nsituation rendered this almost inevitable. On his accession he found\r\nhimself with an empty treasury; he had to incur debts in order to live; he\r\nhad to provide for a costly war with the Visconti; and he had to leave\r\nmoney to enable his successors to carry out his temporal policy. Few Popes\r\nlived so plainly; his money-getting was not for personal luxury, but for\r\nthe supposed requirements of the papal policy. He was the first Pope who\r\nsystematically made the dispensation of grace, temporal and eternal, a\r\nsource of revenue. Hitherto the charges made by the papal Chancery had\r\nbeen, ostensibly at least, for actual work done—fees for clerking and\r\nregistration, and so on. John made the fees proportionate to the grace\r\ndispensed, or to the power of the recipient to pay. He and his successors\r\nmade the _Tithes_, the _Annates_, _Procurations_, Fees for the bestowment\r\nof the _Pallium_, the _Medii Fructus_, _Subsidies_, and _Dispensations_,\r\nregular sources of revenue.\r\n\r\nThe _Tithe_—a tenth of all ecclesiastical incomes for the service of the\r\nPapacy—had been levied occasionally for extraordinary purposes, such as\r\ncrusades. It was still supposed to be levied for special purposes only,\r\nbut necessary occasions became almost continuous, and the exactions were\r\nfiercely resented. When Alexander VI. levied the _Tithe_ in 1500, he was\r\nallowed to do so in England. The French clergy, however, refused to pay;\r\nthey were excommunicated; the University of Paris declared the\r\nexcommunication unlawful, and the Pope had to withdraw.\r\n\r\nThe _Annates_ were an ancient charge. From the beginning of the twelfth\r\ncentury the incoming incumbent of a benefice had to pay over his first\r\nyear’s income for local uses, such as the repairs on ecclesiastical\r\nbuildings, or as a solatium to the heirs of the deceased incumbent. From\r\nthe beginning of the thirteenth century prelates and princes were\r\nsometimes permitted by the Popes to exact it of entrants into benefices.\r\nOne of the earliest recorded instances was when the Archbishop of\r\nCanterbury was allowed to use the _Annates_ of his province for a period\r\nof seven years from 1245, for the purpose of liquidating the debts on his\r\ncathedral church. Pope John XXII. began to appropriate them for the\r\npurposes of the Papacy. His predecessor Clement V. (1305-1314) had\r\ndemanded all the _Annates_ of England and Scotland for a period of three\r\nyears from 1316. In 1316 John made a much wider demand, and in terms which\r\nshowed that he was prepared to regard the _Annates_ as a permanent tax for\r\nthe general purposes of the Papacy. It is difficult to trace the stages of\r\nthe gradual universal enforcement of this tax; but in the decades before\r\nthe Reformation it was commonly imposed, and averages had been struck as\r\nto its amount.(11) “They consisted of a portion, usually computed at\r\none-half, of the estimated revenue of all benefices worth more than 25\r\nflorins. Thus the archbishopric of Rouen was taxed at 12,000 florins, and\r\nthe little see of Grenoble at 300; the great abbacy of St. Denis at 6000,\r\nand the little St. Ciprian Poictiers at 33; while all the parish cures in\r\nFrance were uniformly rated at 24 ducats, equivalent to about 30 florins.”\r\nArchbishoprics were subject to a special tax as the price of the\r\n_Pallium_, and this was often very large.\r\n\r\nThe _Procurationes_ were the charges, commuted to money payments, which\r\nbishops and archdeacons were authorised to make for their personal\r\nexpenses while on their tours of visitation throughout their dioceses. The\r\nPopes began by demanding a share, and ended by often claiming the whole of\r\nthese sums.\r\n\r\nPope John XXII. was the first to require that the incomes of vacant\r\nbenefices (_medii fructus_) should be paid over to the papal treasury\r\nduring the vacancies. The earliest instance dates from 1331, when a demand\r\nwas made for the income of the vacant archbishopric of Gran in Hungary;\r\nand it soon became the custom to insist that the stipends of all vacant\r\nbenefices should be paid into the papal treasury.\r\n\r\nFinally, the Popes declared it to be their right to require special\r\n_subsidies_ from ecclesiastical provinces, and great pressure was put on\r\nthe people to pay these so-called free-will offerings.\r\n\r\nBesides the sums which poured into the papal treasury from these regular\r\nsources of income, irregular sources afforded still larger amounts of\r\nmoney. Countless dispensations were issued on payment of fees for all\r\nmanner of breaches of canonical and moral law—dispensations for marriages\r\nwithin the prohibited degrees, for holding pluralities, for acquiring\r\nunjust gains in trade or otherwise. This demoralising traffic made the\r\nRoman treasury the partner in all kinds of iniquitous actions, and Luther,\r\nin his address _To the Nobility of the German Nation respecting the\r\nReformation of the Christian Estate_, could fitly describe the Court of\r\nthe Roman Curia as a place “where vows were annulled, where the monk gets\r\nleave to quit his Order, where priests can enter the married life for\r\nmoney, where bastards can become legitimate, and dishonour and shame may\r\narrive at high honours; all evil repute and disgrace is knighted and\r\nennobled.” “There is,” he adds, “a buying and a selling, a changing,\r\nblustering and bargaining, cheating and lying, robbing and stealing,\r\ndebauchery and villainy, and all kinds of contempt of God that Antichrist\r\ncould not reign worse.”\r\n\r\nThe vast sums of money obtained in these ways do not represent the whole\r\nof the funds which flowed from all parts of Europe into the papal\r\ntreasury. The Roman Curia was the highest court of appeal for the whole\r\nChurch of the West. In any case this involved a large amount of law\r\nbusiness, with the inevitable legal expenses; but the Curia managed to\r\nattract to itself a large amount of business which might have been easily\r\nsettled in the episcopal or metropolitan courts. This was done in\r\npursuance of a double policy—an ecclesiastical and a financial one. The\r\nhalf century before the Reformation saw the overthrow of feudalism and the\r\nconsolidation of kingly absolutism, and something similar was to be seen\r\nin the Papacy as well as among the principalities of Europe. Just as the\r\nkingly absolutism triumphed when the hereditary feudal magnates lost their\r\npower, so papal absolutism could only become an accomplished fact when it\r\ncould trample upon an episcopate deprived of its ecclesiastical\r\nindependence and inherent powers of ruling and judging. The Episcopate was\r\nweakened in many ways,—by exempting abbacies from episcopal control, by\r\nencouraging the mendicant monks to become the rivals of the parish clergy,\r\nand so on,—but the most potent method of degrading it was by encouraging\r\npeople with ecclesiastical complaints to pass by the episcopal courts and\r\nto carry their cases directly to the Pope. Nationalities, men were told,\r\nhad no place within the Catholic Church. Rome was the common fatherland,\r\nand the Pope the universal bishop and judge ordinary. His judgment, which\r\nwas always final, could be had directly. In this way men were enticed to\r\ntake their pleas straight to the Pope. No doubt this involved sending a\r\nmessenger to Italy with a statement of the plea and a request for a\r\nhearing; but it did not necessarily involve that the trial should take\r\nplace at Rome. The central power could delegate its authority, and the\r\ntrial could take place wherever the Pope might appoint. But the conception\r\nundoubtedly did increase largely the business of the courts actually held\r\nin Rome, and caused a flow of money to the imperial city. The Popes were\r\nalso ready to lend monies to impoverished litigants, for which, of course,\r\nheavy interest was charged.\r\n\r\nThe immense amount of business which was thus directed into the papal\r\nchancery from all parts of Europe required a horde of officials, whose\r\nsalaries were provided partly from the incomes of _reserved_ benefices all\r\nover Europe, and partly from the fees and bribes of the litigants. The\r\npapal law-courts were notoriously dilatory, rapacious, and venal. Every\r\ndocument had to pass through an incredible number of hands, and pay a\r\ncorresponding number of fees; and the costs of suits, heavy enough\r\naccording to the prescribed rule of the chancery, were increased immensely\r\nbeyond the regular charges by others which did not appear on the official\r\ntables. Cases are on record where the _briefs_ obtained cost from\r\ntwenty-four to forty-one times the amount of the legitimate official\r\ncharges. The Roman Church had become a law-court, not of the most\r\nreputable kind,—an arena of rival litigants, a chancery of writers,\r\nnotaries, and tax-gatherers,—where transactions about privileges,\r\ndispensations, buying of benefices, etc., were carried on, and where\r\nsuitors went wandering with their petitions from the door of one office to\r\nanother.\r\n\r\nDuring the half century which preceded the Reformation, things went from\r\nbad to worse. The fears aroused by the attempts at a reform through\r\nGeneral Councils had died down, and the Curia had no desire to reform\r\nitself. The venality and rapacity increased when Popes began to sell\r\noffices in the papal court. Boniface IX. (1389-1404) was the first to\r\nraise money by selling these official posts to the highest bidders. “In\r\n1483, when Sixtus IV. (1471-1484) desired to redeem his tiara and jewels,\r\npledged for a loan of 100,000 ducats, he increased his secretaries from\r\nsix to twenty-four, and required each to pay 2600 florins for the office.\r\nIn 1503, to raise funds for Cæsar Borgia, Alexander VI. (1492-1503)\r\ncreated eighty new offices, and sold them for 760 ducats apiece. Julius\r\nII. formed a ‘college’ of one hundred and one scriveners of papal briefs,\r\nin return for which they paid him 74,000 ducats. Leo X. (1513-1521)\r\nappointed sixty chamberlains and a hundred and forty squires, with certain\r\nperquisites, for which the former paid him 90,000 ducats and the latter\r\n112,000. Places thus paid for were personal property, transferable on\r\nsale. Burchard tells us that in 1483 he bought the mastership of\r\nceremonies from his predecessor Patrizzi for 450 ducats, which covered all\r\nexpenses; that in 1505 he vainly offered Julius II. (1503-1513) 2000\r\nducats for a vacant scrivenership, and that soon after he bought the\r\nsuccession to an abbreviatorship for 2040.”(12) When Adrian VI.\r\n(1522-1523) honestly tried to cleanse this Augean stable, he found himself\r\nconfronted with the fact that he would have to turn men adrift who had\r\nspent their capital in buying the places which any reform must suppress.\r\n\r\nThe papal exactions needed to support this luxurious Roman Court,\r\nespecially those taken from the clergy of Europe, were so obnoxious that\r\nit was often hard to collect them, and devices were used which in the end\r\nincreased the burdens of those who were required to provide the money. The\r\npapal court made bargains with the temporal rulers to share the spoils if\r\nthey permitted the collection.(13) The Popes agreed that the kings or\r\nprinces could seize the _Tithes_ or _Annates_ for a prescribed time\r\nprovided the papal officials had their authority to collect them, as a\r\nrule, for Roman use. In the decades before the Reformation it was the\r\ncommon practice to collect these dues by means of agents, often bankers,\r\nwhose charges were enormous, amounting sometimes to fifty per cent. The\r\ncollection of such extraordinary sources of revenue as the Indulgences was\r\nmarked by even worse abuses, such as the employment of pardon-sellers, who\r\noverran Europe, and whose lies and extortions were the common theme of the\r\ndenunciations of the greatest preachers and patriots of the times.\r\n\r\nThe unreformed Papacy of the closing decades of the fifteenth and of the\r\nfirst quarter of the sixteenth century was the open sore of Europe, and\r\nthe object of execrations by almost all contemporary writers. Its abuses\r\nfound no defenders, and its partisans in attacking assailants contented\r\nthemselves with insisting upon the necessity for the spiritual supremacy\r\nof the Bishops of Rome.\r\n\r\n\r\n    “Sant Peters schifflin ist im schwangk\r\n    Ich sorge fast den untergangk,\r\n    Die wallen schlagen allsit dran,\r\n    Es würt vil sturm und plagen han.”(14)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter II. The Political Situation.(15)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 1. The small extent of Christendom.\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring the period of the Reformation a small portion of the world belonged\r\nto Christendom, and of that only a part was affected, either really or\r\nnominally, by the movement. The Christians belonging to the Greek Church\r\nwere entirely outside its influence.\r\n\r\nChristendom had shrunk greatly since the seventh century. The Saracens and\r\ntheir successors in Moslem sovereignty had overrun and conquered many\r\nlands which had formerly been inhabited by a Christian population and\r\ngoverned by Christian rulers. Palestine, Syria, Asia Minor, Egypt, and\r\nNorth Africa westwards to the Straits of Gibraltar, had once been\r\nChristian, and had been lost to Christendom during the seventh and eighth\r\ncenturies. The Moslems had invaded Europe in the West, had conquered the\r\nSpanish Peninsula, had passed the Pyrenees, and had invaded France. They\r\nwere met and defeated in a three days’ battle at Tours (732) by the Franks\r\nunder Charles the Hammer, the grandfather of Charles the Great. After they\r\nhad been thrust back beyond the Pyrenees, the Spanish Peninsula was the\r\nscene of a struggle between Moslem and Christian which lasted for more\r\nthan seven hundred years, and Spain did not become wholly Christian until\r\nthe last decade of the fifteenth century.\r\n\r\nIf the tide of Moslem conquest had been early checked in the West, in the\r\nEast it had flowed steadily if slowly. In 1338, Orchan, Sultan of the\r\nOttoman Turks, seized on Gallipoli, the fortified town which guarded the\r\neastern entrance to the Dardanelles, and the Moslems won a footing on\r\nEuropean soil. A few years later the troops of his son Murad I. had seized\r\na portion of the Balkan peninsula, and had cut off Constantinople from the\r\nrest of Christendom. A hundred years after, Constantinople (1453) had\r\nfallen, the Christian population had been slain or enslaved, the great\r\nchurch of the _Holy Wisdom_ (St. Sophia) had been made a Mohammedan\r\nmosque, and the city had become the metropolis of the wide-spreading\r\nempire of the Ottoman Turks. Servia, Bosnia, Herzogovina (the Duchy, from\r\n_Herzog_, a Duke), Greece, the Peloponnesus, Roumania, Wallachia, and\r\nMoldavia were incorporated in the Moslem Empire. Belgrade and the island\r\nof Rhodes, the two bulwarks of Christendom, had fallen. Germany was\r\nthreatened by Turkish invasions, and for years the bells tolled in\r\nhundreds of German parishes calling the people to pray against the coming\r\nof the Turk. It was not until the heroic defence of Vienna, in 1529, that\r\nthe victorious advance of the Moslem was stayed. Only the Adriatic\r\nseparated Italy from the Ottoman Empire, and the great mountain wall with\r\nthe strip of Dalmatian coast which lies at its foot was the bulwark\r\nbetween civilisation and barbarism.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 2. Consolidation.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn Western Europe, and within the limits affected directly or indirectly\r\nby the Reformation, the distinctive political characteristic of the times\r\nimmediately preceding the movement was consolidation or coalescence.\r\nFeudalism, with its liberties and its lawlessness, was disappearing, and\r\ncompact nations were being formed under monarchies which tended to become\r\nabsolute. If the Scandinavian North be excluded, five nations included\r\nalmost the whole field of Western European life, and in all of them the\r\nprinciple of consolidation is to be seen at work. In three, England,\r\nFrance, and Spain, there emerged great united kingdoms; and if in two,\r\nGermany and Italy, there was no clustering of the people round one\r\ndynasty, the same principle of coalescence showed itself in the formation\r\nof permanent States which had all the appearance of modern kingdoms.\r\n\r\nIt is important for our purpose to glance at each and show the principle\r\nat work.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 3. England.\r\n\r\n\r\nBy the time that the Duke of Richmond had ascended the English throne and\r\nruled with “politic governance” as Henry VII., the distinctively modern\r\nhistory of England had begun. Feudalism had perished on the field of the\r\nbattle of Bosworth. The visitations of the Black Death, the gigantic\r\nagricultural labour strike under Wat Tylor and priest Ball, and the\r\nconsequent transformation of peasant serfs into a free people working for\r\nwages, had created a new England ready for the changes which were to\r\nbridge the chasm between mediæval and modern history. The consolidation of\r\nthe people was favoured by the English custom that the younger sons of the\r\nnobility ranked as commoners, and that the privileges as well as the\r\nestates went to the eldest sons. This kept the various classes of the\r\npopulation from becoming stereotyped into castes, as in Germany, France,\r\nand Spain. It tended to create an ever-increasing middle class, which was\r\nnot confined to the towns, but permeated the country districts also. The\r\nyounger sons of the nobility descended into this middle class, and the\r\ntransformation of the serfs into a wage-earning class enabled some of them\r\nto rise into it. England was the first land to become a compact\r\nnationality.\r\n\r\nThe earlier portion of the reign of Henry VII. was not free from attempts\r\nwhich, if successful, would have thrown the country back into the old\r\ncondition of disintegration. Although the king claimed to unite the rival\r\nlines of York and Lancaster, the Yorkists did not cease to raise\r\ndifficulties at home which were eagerly fostered from abroad. Ireland was\r\na Yorkist stronghold, and Margaret, the dowager Duchess of Burgundy, the\r\nsister of Edward IV., exercised a sufficiently powerful influence in\r\nFlanders to make that land a centre of Yorkist intrigue.\r\n\r\nLambert Simnel, a pretender who claimed to be either the son or the nephew\r\nof Edward IV. (his account of himself varied), appeared in Ireland, and\r\nthe whole island gathered round him. He invaded England, drew to his\r\nstandard many of the old Yorkists, but was defeated at Stoke-on-Trent in\r\n1487. This was really a formidable rebellion. The rising under Perkin\r\nWarbeck, a young Burgundian from Tournay, though supported by Margaret of\r\nBurgundy and James IV. of Scotland, was more easily suppressed. A popular\r\nrevolt against severe taxation was subdued in 1497, and it may be said\r\nthat Henry’s home difficulties were all over by the year 1500. England\r\nentered the sixteenth century as a compact nation.\r\n\r\nThe foreign policy of Henry VII. was alliance with Spain and a\r\nlong-sighted attempt to secure Scotland by peaceful means. It had for\r\nconsequences two marriages which had far-reaching results. The marriage of\r\nHenry’s daughter Margaret with James IV. of Scotland led to the union of\r\nthe two crowns three generations later; and that between Katharine, the\r\nthird daughter of Ferdinand and Isabella of Spain, and the son of Henry\r\nVII. came to be the occasion, if not the cause, of the revolt of England\r\nfrom Rome. Katharine was married to Arthur, Prince of Wales, in 1501\r\n(November 14th). Prince Arthur died on January 14th, 1502. After\r\nprotracted negotiation, lengthened by the unwillingness of the Pope (Pius\r\nIII.) to grant a dispensation, Katharine was contracted to Henry, and the\r\nmarriage took place in the year of Prince Henry’s accession to the crown.\r\nKatharine and Henry were crowned together at Westminster on June 28th,\r\n1509.\r\n\r\nEngland had prospered during the reign of the first Tudor sovereign. The\r\nsteady increase in wool-growing and wool-exporting is in itself testimony\r\nto the fact that the period of internal wars had ceased, for sheep\r\nspeedily become extinct when bands of raiders disturb the country. The\r\ngrowth in the number of artisan capitalists shows that money had become\r\nthe possession of all classes in the community. The rise of the companies\r\nof merchant adventurers proves that England was taking her share in the\r\nworld-trade of the new era. English scholars like Grocyn and Linacre\r\n(tutor in Italy of Pope Leo X. and in England of the Prince of Wales) had\r\nimbibed the New Learning in Italy, and had been followed there by John\r\nColet, who caught the spirit of the Renaissance from the Italian Humanists\r\nand the fervour of a religious revival from Savonarola’s work in Florence.\r\nThe country had emerged from Mediævalism in almost everything when Henry\r\nVIII., the hope of the English Humanists and reformers, ascended the\r\nthrone in 1509.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 4. France.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf England entered on the sixteenth century as the most compact kingdom in\r\nEurope, in the sense that all classes of its society were welded together\r\nmore firmly than anywhere else, it may be said of France at the same date\r\nthat nowhere was the central authority of the sovereign more firmly\r\nestablished. Many things had worked for this state of matters. The Hundred\r\nYears’ War with England did for France what the wars against the Moors had\r\ndone for Spain. It had created a sense of nationality. It had also made\r\nnecessary national armies and the raising of national taxes. During the\r\nweary period of anarchy under Charles VI. every local and provincial\r\ninstitution of France had seemed to crumble or to display its inefficiency\r\nto help the nation in its sorest need. The one thing which was able to\r\nstand the storms and stress of the time was the kingly authority, and this\r\nin spite of the incapacity of the man who possessed it. The reign of\r\nCharles VII. had made it plain that England was not destined to remain in\r\npossession of French territory; and the succeeding reigns had seen the\r\ncentral authority slowly acquiring irresistible strength. Charles VII. by\r\nhis policy of yielding slightly to pressure and sitting still when he\r\ncould—by his inactivity, perhaps masterly,—Louis XI. by his restless,\r\nunscrupulous craft, Anne of Beaujeu (his daughter) by her clear insight\r\nand prompt decision, had not only laid the foundations, but built up and\r\nconsolidated the edifice of absolute monarchy in France. The kingly power\r\nhad subdued the great nobles and feudatories; it had to a large extent\r\nmastered the Church; it had consolidated the towns and made them props to\r\nits power; and it had made itself the direct lord of the peasants.\r\n\r\nThe work of consolidation had been as rapid as it was complete. In 1464,\r\nthree years after his succession, Louis XI. was confronted by a formidable\r\nassociation of the great feudatories of France, which called itself the\r\n_League of Public Weal_. Charles of Guyenne, the king’s brother, the Count\r\nof Charolais (known as Charles the Bold of Burgundy), the Duke of\r\nBrittany, the two great families of the Armagnacs, the elder represented\r\nby the Count of Armagnac, and the younger by the Duke of Nemours, John of\r\nAnjou, Duke of Calabria, and the Duke of Bourbon, were allied in arms\r\nagainst the king. Yet by 1465 Normandy had been wrested from the Duke of\r\nGuyenne; Guyenne itself had become the king’s in 1472; the Duke of Nemours\r\nhad been crushed and slain in 1476; the Count of Charolais, become Duke of\r\nBurgundy, had been overthrown, his power shattered, and himself slain by\r\nthe Swiss peasant confederates, and almost all his French _fiefs_ had been\r\nincorporated by 1480; and on the death of King René (1480) the provinces\r\nof Anjou and Provence had been annexed to the Crown of France. The great\r\nfeudatories were so thoroughly broken that their attempt to revolt during\r\nthe earlier years of the reign of Charles VIII. was easily frustrated by\r\nAnne of Beaujeu acting on behalf of the young king.\r\n\r\nThe efforts to secure hold on the Church date back from the days of the\r\nCouncil of Basel, when Pope Eugenius was at hopeless issue with the\r\nmajority of its members. In 1438 a deputation from the Council waited upon\r\nthe king and laid before him the conciliar plans of reform. Charles VII.\r\nsummoned an assembly of the French clergy to meet at Bourges. He was\r\npresent himself with his principal nobles; and the meeting was also\r\nattended by members of the Council and by papal delegates. There the\r\ncelebrated Pragmatic Sanction of Bourges was formally presented and agreed\r\nupon.\r\n\r\nThis Pragmatic Sanction embodied most of the cherished conciliar plans of\r\nreform. It asserted the ecclesiastical supremacy of Councils over Popes.\r\nIt demanded a meeting of a Council every ten years. It declared that the\r\nselection of the higher ecclesiastics was to be left to the Chapters and\r\nto the Convents. It denied the Pope’s general claim to the reservation of\r\nbenefices, and greatly limited its use in special cases. It did away with\r\nthe Pope’s right to act as Ordinary, and insisted that no ecclesiastical\r\ncases should be appealed to Rome without first having exhausted the lower\r\ncourts of jurisdiction. It abolished the _Annates_, with some exceptions\r\nin favour of the present Pope. It also made some attempts to provide the\r\nchurches with an educated ministry. All these declarations simply carried\r\nout the proposals of the Council of Basel; but they had an important\r\ninfluence on the position of the French clergy towards the king. The\r\nPragmatic Sanction, though issued by an assembly of the French clergy, was\r\nnevertheless a royal ordinance, and thereby gave the king indefinite\r\nrights over the Church within France. The right to elect bishops and\r\nabbots was placed in the hands of Chapters and Convents, but the king and\r\nnobles were expressly permitted to bring forward and recommend candidates,\r\nand this might easily be extended to enforcing the election of those\r\nrecommended. Indefinite rights of patronage on the part of the king and of\r\nthe nobles over benefices in France could not fail to be the result, and\r\nthe French Church could scarcely avoid assuming the appearance of a\r\nnational Church controlled by the king as the head of the State. The\r\nabolition of the Pragmatic Sanction was always a bait which the French\r\nking could dangle before the eyes of the Pope, and the promise to maintain\r\nthe Pragmatic Sanction was always a bribe to secure the support of the\r\nclergy and the _Parlements_ of France.\r\n\r\nIn 1516, Francis I. and Leo X. agreed on a Concordat, the practical effect\r\nof which was that the king received the right to nominate to almost all\r\nthe higher vacant benefices in France, while the Popes received the\r\n_Annates_. The results were not beneficial to the Church. It left the\r\nclergy a prey to papal exactions, and it compelled them to seek for\r\npromotion through subserviency to the king and the court; but it had the\r\neffect of ranging the monarch on the side of the Papacy when the\r\nReformation came.\r\n\r\nIt can scarcely be said that France was a compact nation. The nobility\r\nwere separated from the middle and lower classes by the fact that all\r\nyounger sons retained the status and privileges of nobles. In ancient\r\ntimes they had paid no share of the taxes raised for war, on the ground\r\nthat they rendered personal service, and the privilege of being free from\r\ntaxation was retained long after the services of a feudal militia had\r\ndisappeared. The nobility in France became a caste, numerous, poor in many\r\ninstances, and too proud to belittle themselves by entering any of the\r\nprofessions or engaging in commerce.\r\n\r\nLouis XI. had done his best to encourage trade, and had introduced the\r\nsilkworm industry into France. But as the whole weight of taxation fell\r\nupon the rural districts, the middle classes took refuge in the towns, and\r\nthe peasantry, between the dues they had to pay to their lords and the\r\ntaxation for the king, were in an oppressed condition. Their grievances\r\nwere set forth in the petition they addressed, in the delusive hope of\r\namelioration, to the States-General which assembled on the accession of\r\nCharles VIII. “During the past thirty-four years,” they say, “troops have\r\nbeen ever passing through France and living on the poor people. When the\r\npoor man has managed, by the sale of the coat on his back, and after hard\r\ntoil, to pay his _taille_, and hopes he may live out the year on the\r\nlittle he has left, then come fresh troops to his cottage, eating him up.\r\nIn Normandy, multitudes have died of hunger. From want of cattle, men and\r\nwomen have to yoke themselves to the carts; and others, fearing that if\r\nseen in the daytime they will be seized for not having paid their\r\n_taille_, are compelled to work at night. The king should have pity on his\r\npoor people, and relieve them from the said _tailles_ and charges.” This\r\nwas in 1483, before the Italian wars had further increased the burdens\r\nwhich the poorest class of the community had to pay.\r\n\r\nThe New Learning had begun to filter into France at a comparatively early\r\ndate. In 1458 an Italian of Greek descent had been appointed to teach\r\nGreek by the University of Paris. But that University had been for long\r\nthe centre of mediæval scholastic study, and it was not until the Italian\r\ncampaigns of Charles VIII., who was in Italy when the Renaissance was at\r\nits height, that France may be said to have welcomed the Humanist\r\nmovement. A Greek Press was established in Paris in 1507, a group of\r\nFrench Humanists entered upon the study of the authors of classical\r\nantiquity, and the new learning gradually displaced the old scholastic\r\ndisciplines. French Humanists were perhaps the earliest to make a special\r\nstudy of Roman Law, and to win distinction as eminent jurists. Francis,\r\nlike Henry VIII. of England, was welcomed on his accession as a Humanist\r\nking. Such was the condition of France in the beginning of the sixteenth\r\ncentury.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 5. Spain.\r\n\r\n\r\nSpain had for centuries been under Mohammedan domination. The Moslems had\r\noverrun almost the whole country, and throughout its most fertile\r\nprovinces the Christian peasantry lived under masters of an alien faith.\r\nAt the beginning of the tenth century the only independent Christian\r\nprincipalities were small states lying along the southern shore of the Bay\r\nof Biscay and the south-western slopes of the Pyrenees. The Gothic and\r\nVandal chiefs slowly recovered the northern districts, while the Moors\r\nretained the more fertile provinces of the south. The political conditions\r\nof the country at the close of the fifteenth century inevitably reflected\r\nthis gradual reconquest, which had brought the Christian principalities\r\ninto existence. In 1474, when Isabella (she had been married in 1469 to\r\nFerdinand, the heir to Aragon) succeeded her brother Henry IV. in the\r\nsovereignty of Castile, Spain was divided into five separate\r\nprincipalities: Castile, with Leon, containing 62 per cent.; Aragon, with\r\nValentia and Catalonia, containing 15 per cent.; Portugal, containing 20\r\nper cent.; Navarre, containing 1 per cent.; and Granada, the only\r\nremaining Moslem State, containing 2 per cent. of the entire surface of\r\nthe country.\r\n\r\nCastile had grown by almost continuous conquest of lands from the Moslems,\r\nand these additions were acquired in many ways. If they had been made in\r\nwhat may be termed a national war, the lands seized became the property of\r\nthe king, and could be retained by him or granted to his lords spiritual\r\nand temporal under varying conditions. In some cases these grants made the\r\npossessors almost independent princes. On the other hand, lands might be\r\nwrested from the aliens by private adventurers, and in such cases they\r\nremained in possession of the conquerors, who formed municipalities which\r\nhad the right of choosing and of changing their overlords, and really\r\nformed independent communities. Then there were, as was natural in a\r\nperiod of continuous warfare, waste lands. These became the property of\r\nthose who settled on them. Lastly, there were the dangerous frontier\r\nlands, which it was the policy of king or great lord who owned them to\r\npeople with settlers, who could only be induced to undertake the perilous\r\noccupation provided they received charters (_fueros_), which guaranteed\r\ntheir practical independence. In such a condition of things the central\r\nauthority could not be strong. It was further weakened by the fact that\r\nthe great feudatories claimed to have both civil administration and\r\nmilitary rule over their lands, and assumed an almost regal state.\r\nMilitary religious orders abounded, and were possessed of great wealth.\r\nTheir Grand Masters, in virtue of their office, were independent military\r\ncommanders, and had great gifts, in the shape of rich commandries, to\r\nbestow on their followers. Their power overshadowed that of the sovereign.\r\nThe great ecclesiastics, powerful feudal lords in virtue of their lands,\r\nclaimed the rights of civil administration and military rule like their\r\nlay compeers, and, being personally protected by the indefinable sanctity\r\nof the priestly character, were even more turbulent. Almost universal\r\nanarchy had prevailed during the reigns of the two weak kings who preceded\r\nIsabella on the throne of Castile, and the crown lands, the support and\r\nspecial protection of the sovereign, had been alienated by lavish gifts to\r\nthe great nobles. This was the situation which faced the young queen when\r\nshe came into her inheritance. It was aggravated by a rebellion on behalf\r\nof Juanna, the illegitimate daughter of Henry IV. The rebellion was\r\nsuccessfully crushed. The queen and her consort, who was not yet in\r\npossession of the throne of Aragon, then tried to give the land security.\r\nThe previous anarchy had produced its usual results. The country was\r\ninfested with bands of brigands, and life was not safe outside the walls\r\nof the towns. Isabella instituted, or rather revived, the Holy Brotherhood\r\n(_Hermandad_), a force of cavalry raised by the whole country (each group\r\nof one hundred houses was bound to provide one horseman). It was an army\r\nof mounted police. It had its own judges, who tried criminals on the scene\r\nof their crimes, and those convicted were punished by the troops according\r\nto the sentences pronounced. Its avowed objects were to put down all\r\ncrimes of violence committed outside the cities, and to hunt criminals who\r\nhad fled from the towns’ justice. Its judges superseded the justiciary\r\npowers of the nobles, who protested in vain. The Brotherhood did its work\r\nvery effectively, and the towns and the common people rallied round the\r\nmonarchy which had given them safety for limb and property.\r\n\r\nThe sovereigns next attacked the position of the nobles, whose mutual\r\nfeuds rendered them a comparatively easy foe to rulers who had proved\r\ntheir strength of government. The royal domains, which had been alienated\r\nduring the previous reign, were restored to the sovereign, and many of the\r\nmost abused privileges of the nobility were curtailed.\r\n\r\nOne by one the Grand Masterships of the Crusading Orders were centred in\r\nthe person of the Crown, the Pope acquiescing and granting investiture.\r\nThe Church was stripped of some of its superfluous wealth, and the civil\r\npowers of the higher ecclesiastics were abolished or curtailed. In the end\r\nit may be said that the Spanish clergy were made almost as subservient to\r\nthe sovereign as were those of France.\r\n\r\nThe pacification and consolidation of Castile was followed by the conquest\r\nof Granada. The Holy Brotherhood served the purpose of a standing army,\r\ninternal feuds among the Moors aided the Christians, and after a\r\nprotracted struggle (1481-1492) the city of Granada was taken, and the\r\nMoorish rule in the Peninsula ceased. All Spain, save Portugal and Navarre\r\n(seized by Ferdinand in 1512), was thus united under Ferdinand and\r\nIsabella, the Catholic Sovereigns as they came to be called, and the civil\r\nunity increased the desire for religious uniformity. The Jews in Spain\r\nwere numerous, wealthy, and influential. They had intermarried with many\r\nnoble families, and almost controlled the finance of the country. It was\r\nresolved to compel them to become Christians, by force if necessary. In\r\n1478 a Bull was obtained from Pope Sixtus IV. establishing the Inquisition\r\nin Spain, it being provided that the inquisitors were to be appointed by\r\nthe sovereign. The Holy Office in this way became an instrument for\r\nestablishing a civil despotism, as well as a means for repressing heresy.\r\nIt did its work with a ruthless severity hitherto unexampled. Sixtus\r\nhimself and some of his successors, moved by repeated complaints,\r\nendeavoured to restrain its savage energy; but the Inquisition was too\r\nuseful an instrument in the hands of a despotic sovereign, and the Popes\r\nwere forced to allow its proceedings, and to refuse all appeals to Rome\r\nagainst its sentences. It was put in use against the Moorish subjects of\r\nthe Catholic kings, notwithstanding the terms of the capitulation of\r\nGranada, which provided for the exercise of civil and religious liberty.\r\nThe result was that, in spite of fierce rebellions, all the Moors, save\r\nsmall groups of families under the special protection of the Crown, had\r\nbecome nominal Christians by 1502, although almost a century had to pass\r\nbefore the Inquisition had rooted out the last traces of the Moslem faith\r\nin the Spanish Peninsula.\r\n\r\nThe death of Isabella in 1504 roughly dates a formidable rising against\r\nthis process of repression and consolidation. The severities of the\r\nInquisition, the insistence of Ferdinand to govern personally the lands of\r\nhis deceased wife, and many local causes led to widespread conspiracies\r\nand revolts against his rule. The years between 1504 and 1522 were a\r\nperiod of revolutions and of lawlessness which was ended when Charles V.,\r\nthe grandson of Ferdinand and Isabella, overcame all resistance and\r\ninaugurated a reign of personal despotism which long distinguished the\r\nkingdom of Spain. Spanish troubles had something to do with preventing\r\nCharles from putting into execution in Germany, as he wished to do, the\r\nban issued at Worms against Martin Luther.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 6. Germany and Italy.\r\n\r\n\r\nGermany and Italy, in the beginning of the sixteenth century, had made\r\nalmost no progress in becoming united and compact nations. The process of\r\nnational consolidation, which was a feature of the times, displayed itself\r\nin these lands in the creation of compact principalities rather than in a\r\ngreat and effective national movement under one sovereign power. It is a\r\ncommonplace of history to say that the main reason for this was the\r\npresence within these two lands of the Pope and the Emperor, the twin\r\npowers of the earlier mediæval ideal of a dual government, at once civil\r\nand ecclesiastical. Machiavelli expressed the common idea in his clear and\r\nstrenuous fashion. He says that the Italians owe it to Rome that they are\r\ndivided into factions and not united as were Spain and France. The Pope,\r\nhe explains, who claimed temporal as well as spiritual jurisdiction,\r\nthough not strong enough to rule all Italy by himself, was powerful enough\r\nto prevent any other Italian dynasty from taking his place. Whenever he\r\nsaw any Italian power growing strong enough to have a future before it, he\r\ninvited the aid of some foreign potentate, thus making Italy a prey to\r\ncontinual invasions. The shadowy lordship of the Pope was sufficient, in\r\nthe opinion of Machiavelli, to prevent any real lordship under a native\r\ndynasty within the Italian peninsula. In Germany there was a similar\r\nimpotency. The German king was the Emperor, the mediæval head of the Holy\r\nRoman Empire, the “king of the Romans.” Some idea of what underlay the\r\nthought and its expression may be had when one reads across Albert Dürer’s\r\nportrait of Maximilian, “Imperator Cæsar Divus Maximilianus Pius Felix\r\nAugustus,” just as if he had been Trajan or Constantine. The phrase\r\ncarries us back to the times when the Teutonic tribes swept down on the\r\nRoman possessions in Western Europe and took possession of them. They were\r\nbarbarians with an unalterable reverence for the wider civilisation of the\r\ngreat Empire which they had conquered. They crept into the shell of the\r\ngreat Empire and tried to assimilate its jurisprudence and its religion.\r\nHence it came to pass, in the earlier Middle Ages, as Mr. Freeman says,\r\n“The two great powers in Western Europe were the Church and the Empire,\r\nand the centre of each, in imagination at least, was Rome. Both of these\r\nwent on through the settlements of the German nations, and both in a\r\nmanner drew new powers from the change of things. Men believed more than\r\never that Rome was the lawful and natural centre of the world. For it was\r\nheld that there were of divine right two Vicars of God upon earth, the\r\nRoman Emperor, His Vicar in temporal things, and the Roman Bishop, His\r\nVicar in spiritual things. This belief did not interfere with the\r\nexistence either of separate commonwealths, principalities, or of national\r\nChurches. But it was held that the Roman Emperor, who was the Lord of the\r\nWorld, was of right the head of all temporal States, and the Roman Bishop,\r\nthe Pope, was the head of all the Churches.” This idea was a devout\r\nimagination, and was never actually and fully expressed in fact. No\r\nEastern nation or Church ever agreed with it; and the temporal lordship of\r\nthe Emperors was never completely acknowledged even in the West. Still it\r\nruled in men’s minds with all the force of an ideal. As the modern nations\r\nof Europe came gradually into being, the real headship of the Emperor\r\nbecame more and more shadowy. But both headships could prevent the\r\nnational consolidation of the countries, Germany and Italy, in which the\r\npossessors dwelt. All this is, as has been said, a commonplace of history,\r\nand, like all commonplaces, it contains a great deal of truth. Still it\r\nmay be questioned whether the mediæval idea was solely responsible for the\r\ndisintegration of either Germany or Italy in the sixteenth century. A\r\ncareful study of the conditions of things in both countries makes us see\r\nthat many causes were at work besides the mediæval idea—conditions\r\ngeographical, social, and historical. Whatever the causes, the\r\ndisintegration of these two lands was in marked contrast to the\r\nconsolidation of the three other nations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 7. Italy.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the end of the fifteenth century, Italy contained a very great number\r\nof petty principalities and five States which might be called the great\r\npowers of Italy—Venice, Milan, and Florence in the north, Naples in the\r\nsouth, and the States of the Church in the centre. Peace was kept by a\r\ndelicate and highly artificial balance of powers. Venice was a commercial\r\nrepublic, ruled by an oligarchy of nobles. The city in the lagoons had\r\nbeen founded by trembling fugitives fleeing before Attila’s Huns, and was\r\nmore than a thousand years old. It had large territories on the mainland\r\nof Italy, and colonies extending down the east coast of the Adriatic and\r\namong the Greek islands. It had the largest revenue of all the Italian\r\nStates, but its expenses were also much the heaviest. Milan came next in\r\nwealth, with its yearly income of over 700,000 ducats. At the close of the\r\ncentury it was in the possession of the Sforza family, whose founder had\r\nbeen born a ploughman, and had risen to be a formidable commander of\r\nmercenary soldiers. It was claimed by Maximilian as a fief of the Empire,\r\nand by the Kings of France as a heritage of the Dukes of Orleans. The\r\ndisputed heritage was one of the causes of the invasion of Italy by\r\nCharles VIII. Florence, the most cultured city in Italy, was, like Venice,\r\na commercial republic; but it was a democratic republic, wherein one\r\nfamily, the Medici, had usurped almost despotic power while preserving all\r\nthe external marks of republican rule.\r\n\r\nNaples was the portion of Italy where the feudal system of the Middle Ages\r\nhad lingered longest. The old kingdom of the Two Sicilies (Naples and\r\nSicily) had, since 1458, been divided, and Sicily had been politically\r\nseparated from the mainland. The island belonged to the King of Aragon;\r\nwhile the mainland had for its ruler the illegitimate son of Alphonso of\r\nAragon, Ferdinand, or Ferrante, who proved a despotic and masterful ruler.\r\nHe had crushed his semi-independent feudal barons, had brought the towns\r\nunder his despotic rule, and was able to hand over a compact kingdom to\r\nhis son Alphonso in 1494.\r\n\r\nThe feature, however, in the political condition of Italy which\r\nillustrated best the general tendency of the age towards coalescence, was\r\nthe growth of the States of the Church. The dominions which were directly\r\nunder the temporal power of the Pope had been the most disorganised in all\r\nItaly. The vassal barons had been turbulently independent, and the Popes\r\nhad little power even within the city of Rome. The helplessness of the\r\nPopes to control their vassals perhaps reached its lowest stage in the\r\ndays of Innocent VIII. His successors Alexander VI. (Rodrigo Borgia,\r\n1492-1503), Julius II. (Cardinal della Rovere, 1503-1513), and Leo X.\r\n(Giovanni de Medici, 1513-1521), strove to create, and partly succeeded in\r\nforming, a strong central dominion, the States of the Church. The troubled\r\ntimes of the French invasions, and the continual warfare among the more\r\npowerful States of Italy, furnished them with the occasion. They pursued\r\ntheir policy with a craft which brushed aside all moral obligations, and\r\nwith a ruthlessness which hesitated at no amount of bloodshed. In their\r\nhands the Papacy appeared to be a merely temporal power, and was treated\r\nas such by contemporary politicians. It was one of the political States of\r\nItaly, and the Popes were distinguished from their contemporary Italian\r\nrulers only by the facts that their spiritual position enabled them to\r\nexercise a European influence which the others could not aspire to, and\r\nthat their sacred character placed them above the obligations of ordinary\r\nmorality in the matter of keeping solemn promises and maintaining treaty\r\nobligations made binding by the most sacred oaths. In one sense their aim\r\nwas patriotic. They were Italian princes whose aim was to create a strong\r\nItalian central power which might be able to maintain the independence of\r\nItaly against the foreigner; and in this they were partially successful,\r\nwhatever judgment may require to be passed on the means taken to attain\r\ntheir end. But the actions of the Italian prince placed the spiritual Head\r\nof the Church outside all those influences, intellectual, artistic, and\r\nreligious (the revival under Savonarola in Florence), which were working\r\nin Italy for the regeneration of European society. The Popes of the\r\nRenaissance set the example, only too faithfully followed by almost every\r\nprince of the age, of believing that political far outweighed all moral\r\nand religious motives.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 8. Germany.\r\n\r\n\r\nGermany, or the Empire, as it was called, included, in the days of the\r\nReformation, the Low Countries in the north-west and most of what are now\r\nthe Austro-Hungarian lands in the east. It was in a strange condition. On\r\nthe one hand a strong popular sentiment for unity had arisen in all the\r\nGerman-speaking portions, and on the other the country was cut into\r\nsections and slices, and was more hopelessly divided than was Italy\r\nitself.\r\n\r\nNominally the Empire was ruled over by one supreme lord, with a great\r\nfeudal assembly, the Diet, under him.\r\n\r\nThe Empire was elective, though for generations the rulers chosen had\r\nalways been the heads of the House of Hapsburg, and since 1356 the\r\nelection had been in the hands of seven prince-electors—three on the Elbe\r\nand four on the Rhine. On the Elbe were the King of Bohemia, the Elector\r\nof Saxony, and the Elector of Brandenburg; on the Rhine, the Count\r\nPalatine of the Rhine and the Archbishops of Mainz, Trier, and Köln.\r\n\r\nThis Empire, nominally one, and full of the strongest sentiments of unity,\r\nwas hopelessly divided, and—for this was the peculiarity of the\r\nsituation—all the elements making for peaceful government, which in\r\ncountries like France or England supported the central power, were on the\r\nside of disunion.\r\n\r\nA glance at the map of Germany in the times of the Reformation shows an\r\nastonishing multiplicity of separate principalities, ecclesiastical and\r\nsecular, all the more bewildering that most of them appeared to be\r\ncomposed of patches lying separate from each other. Almost every ruling\r\nprince had to cross some neighbour’s land to visit the outlying portions\r\nof his dominions. It must also be remembered that the divisions which can\r\nbe represented on a map but faintly express the real state of things. The\r\nterritories of the imperial cities—the lands outside the walls ruled by\r\nthe civic fathers—were for the most part too small to figure on any map,\r\nand for the same reason the tiny principalities of the hordes of free\r\nnobles are also invisible. So we have to imagine all those little mediæval\r\nrepublics and those infinitesimal kingdoms camped on the territories of\r\nthe great princes, and taking from them even the small amount of unity\r\nwhich the map shows.\r\n\r\nThe greater feudal States, Electoral and Ducal Saxony, Brandenburg,\r\nBavaria, the Palatinate, Hesse, and many others, had meetings of their own\r\nEstates,—Councils of subservient nobles and lawyers,—their own Supreme\r\nCourts of Justice, from which there was no appeal, their own fiscal\r\nsystem, their own finance and coinage, and largely controlled their clergy\r\nand their relations to powers outside Germany. Their princes, hampered as\r\nthey were by the great Churchmen, thwarted continually by the town\r\nrepublics, defied by the free nobles, were nevertheless actual kings, and\r\nprofited by the centralising tendencies of the times. They alone in\r\nGermany represented settled central government, and attracted to\r\nthemselves the smaller units lying outside and around them.\r\n\r\nYet with all these divisions, having their roots deep down in the past,\r\nthere was pervading all classes of society, from princes to peasants, the\r\nsentiment of a united Germany, and no lack of schemes to convert the\r\nfeeling into fact. The earliest practical attempts began with the union of\r\nGerman Churchmen at Constance and the scheme for a National Church of\r\nGermany; and the dream of ecclesiastical unity brought in its train the\r\naspiration after political oneness.\r\n\r\nThe practical means proposed to create a German national unity over lands\r\nwhich stretched from the Straits of Dover to the Vistula, and from the\r\nBaltic to the Adriatic, were the proclamation of a universal Land’s Peace,\r\nforbidding all internecine war between Germans; the establishment of a\r\nSupreme Court of Justice to decide quarrels within the Empire; a common\r\ncoinage, and a common Customs Union. To bind all more firmly together\r\nthere was needed a Common Council or governing body, which, under the\r\nEmperor, should determine the Home and Foreign Policy of the Empire. The\r\nonly authorities which could create a governmental unity of this kind were\r\nthe Emperor on the one hand and the great princes on the other, and the\r\ntwo needed to be one in mutual confidence and in intention. But that is\r\nwhat never happened, and all through the reign of Maximilian and in the\r\nearly years of Charles we find two different conceptions of what the\r\ncentral government ought to be—the one oligarchic and the other\r\nautocratic. The princes were resolved to keep their independence, and\r\ntheir plans for unity always implied a governing oligarchy with serious\r\nrestraint placed on the power of the Emperor; while the Emperors, who\r\nwould never submit to be controlled by an oligarchy of German princes, and\r\nwho found that they could not carry out their schemes for an autocratic\r\nunity, were at least able to wreck any other.\r\n\r\nThe German princes have been accused of preferring the security and\r\nenlargement of their dynastic possessions to the unity of the Empire, but\r\nit can be replied that in doing so they only followed the example set them\r\nby their Emperors. Frederick III., Maximilian, and Charles V. invariably\r\nneglected imperial interests when they clashed with the welfare of the\r\nfamily possessions of the House of Hapsburg. When Maximilian inherited the\r\nimperial Burgundian lands, a fief of the Empire, through his marriage with\r\nMary, the heiress of Charles the Bold, he treated the inheritance as part\r\nof the family estates of his House. The Tyrol was absorbed by the House of\r\nHapsburg when the Swabian League prevented Bavaria seizing it (1487). The\r\nsame fate fell on the Duchy of Austria when Vienna was recovered, and on\r\nHungary and Bohemia; and when Charles V. got hold of Würtemberg on the\r\noutlawry of Duke Ulrich, it, too, was detached from the Empire and\r\nabsorbed into the family possessions of the Hapsburgs. There was, in\r\nshort, a persistent policy pursued by three successive Emperors, of\r\ndespoiling the Empire in order to increase the family possessions of the\r\nHouse to which they belonged.\r\n\r\nThe last attempt to give a constitutional unity to the German Empire was\r\nmade at the Diet of Worms (1521)—the Diet before which Luther appeared.\r\nThere the Emperor, Charles V., agreed to accept a _Reichsregiment_, which\r\nwas in all essential points, though differing in some details, the same as\r\nhis grandfather Maximilian had proposed to the Diet of 1495. The Central\r\nCouncil was composed of a President and four members appointed by the\r\nEmperor, six Electors (the King of Bohemia being excluded), who might sit\r\nin person or by deputies, and twelve members appointed by the rest of the\r\nEstates. The cities were not represented. This _Reichsregiment_ was to\r\ngovern all German lands, including Austria and the Netherlands, but\r\nexcluding Bohemia. Switzerland, hitherto nominally within the Empire,\r\nformally withdrew and ceased to form part of Germany. The central\r\ngovernment needed funds to carry on its work, and especially to provide an\r\narmy to enforce its decisions; and various schemes for raising the money\r\nrequired were discussed at its earlier meetings. It was resolved at last\r\nto raise the necessary funds by imposing a tax of four per cent. on all\r\nimports and exports, and to establish custom-houses on all the frontiers.\r\nThe practical effect of this was to lay the whole burden of taxation upon\r\nthe mercantile classes, or, in other words, to make the cities, who were\r\nnot represented in the _Reichsregiment_, pay for the whole of the central\r\ngovernment. This _Reichsregiment_ was to be simply a board of advice,\r\nwithout any decisive control so long as the Emperor was in Germany. When\r\nhe was absent from the country it had an independent power of government.\r\nBut all important decisions had to be confirmed by the absent Emperor,\r\nwho, for his part, promised to form no foreign leagues involving Germany\r\nwithout the consent of the Council.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the _Reichsregiment_ had settled its scheme of taxation, the\r\ncities on which it was proposed to lay the whole burden of providing the\r\nfunds required very naturally objected. They met by representatives at\r\nSpeyer (1523), and sent delegates to Spain, to Valladolid, where Charles\r\nhappened to be, to protest against the scheme of taxation. They were\r\nsupported by the great German capitalists. The Emperor received them\r\ngraciously, and promised to take the government into his own hands. In\r\nthis way the last attempt to give a governmental unity to Germany was\r\ndestroyed by the joint action of the Emperor and of the cities. It is\r\nunquestionable that the Reformation under Luther did seriously assist in\r\nthe disintegration of Germany, but it must be remembered that a movement\r\ncannot become national where there is no nation, and that German\r\nnationality had been hopelessly destroyed just at the time when it was\r\nmost needed to unify and moderate the great religious impulses which were\r\nthrobbing in the hearts of its citizens.\r\n\r\nMaximilian had been elected King of the Romans in 1486, and had succeeded\r\nto the Empire on the death of his father, Frederick III., in 1493. His was\r\na strongly fascinating personality—a man full of enthusiasms, never\r\nlacking in ideas, but singularly destitute of the patient practical power\r\nto make them workable. He may almost be called a type of that Germany over\r\nwhich he was called to rule. No man was fuller of the longing for German\r\nunity as an ideal; no man did more to perpetuate the very real divisions\r\nof the land.\r\n\r\nHe was the patron of German learning and of German art, and won the\r\npraises of the German Humanists: no ruler was more celebrated in\r\ncontemporary song. He protected and supported the German towns, encouraged\r\ntheir industries, and fostered their culture. In almost everything ideal\r\nhe stood for German nationality and unity. He placed himself at the head\r\nof all those intellectual and artistic forces from which spread the\r\nthought of a united Germany for the Germans. On the other hand, his one\r\npersistent practical policy, and the only one in which he was almost\r\nuniformly successful, was to unify and consolidate the family possessions\r\nof the House of Hapsburg. In this policy he was the leader of those who\r\nbroke up Germany into an aggregate of separate and independent\r\nprincipalities. The greater German princes followed his example, and did\r\ntheir best to transform themselves into the civilised rulers of modern\r\nStates.\r\n\r\nMaximilian died somewhat unexpectedly on January 12th, 1519, and five\r\nmonths were spent in intrigues by the partisans of Francis of France and\r\nyoung Charles, King of Spain, the grandson of Maximilian. The French party\r\nbelieved that they had secured by bribery a majority of the Electors; and\r\nwhen this was whispered about, the popular feeling in favour of Charles,\r\non account of his German blood, soon began to manifest itself. It was\r\nnaturally strongest in the Rhine provinces. Papal delegates could not get\r\nthe Rhine skippers to hire boats to them for their journey, as it was\r\nbelieved that the Pope favoured the French king. The Imperial Cities\r\naccused Francis of fomenting internecine war in Germany, and displayed\r\ntheir hatred of his candidature. The very Landsknechten clamoured for the\r\ngrandson of their “Father” Maximilian. The eyes of all Germany were turned\r\nanxiously enough to the venerable town of Frankfurt-on-the-Main, where,\r\naccording to ancient usage, the Electors met to select the ruler of the\r\nHoly Roman Empire. On the 28th of June (1519) the alarm bell of the town\r\ngave the signal, and the Electors assembled in their scarlet robes of\r\nState in the dim little chapel of St. Bartholomew, where the conclave was\r\nalways held. The manifestation of popular feeling had done its work.\r\nCharles was unanimously chosen, and all Germany rejoiced,—the good\r\nburghers of Frankfurt declaring that if the Electors had chosen Francis\r\nthey would have been “playing with death.”\r\n\r\nIt was a wave of national excitement, the desire for a _German_ ruler,\r\nthat had brought about the unanimous election; and never were a people\r\nmore mistaken and, in the end, disappointed. Charles was the heir of the\r\nHouse of Hapsburg, the grandson of Maximilian, his veins full of German\r\nblood. But he was no German. Maximilian was the last of the real German\r\nHapsburgs. History scarcely shows another instance where the mother’s\r\nblood has so completely changed the character of a race. Charles was his\r\nmother’s son, and her Spanish characteristics showed themselves in him in\r\ngreater strength as the years went on. When he abdicated, he retired to\r\nend his days in a Spanish convent. It was the Spaniard, not the German,\r\nwho faced Luther at Worms.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter III. The Renaissance.(16)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 1. The Transition from the Mediæval to the Modern World.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe movement called the Renaissance, in its widest extent, may be\r\ndescribed as the transition from the mediæval to the modern world. All our\r\npresent conceptions of life and thought find their roots within this\r\nperiod.\r\n\r\nIt saw the beginnings of modern science and the application of true\r\nscientific methods to the investigation of nature. It witnessed the\r\nastronomical discoveries of Copernicus and Galileo, the foundation of\r\nanatomy under Vessalius, and the discovery of the circulation of the blood\r\nby Harvey.\r\n\r\nIt was the age of geographical explorations. The discoveries of the\r\ntelescope, the mariner’s compass, and gunpowder gave men mastery over\r\npreviously unknown natural forces, and multiplied their powers, their\r\ndaring, and their capacities for adventure. When these geographical\r\ndiscoveries had made a world-trade a possible thing, there began that\r\nchange from mediæval to modern methods in trade and commerce which lasted\r\nfrom the close of the fourteenth to the beginning of the seventeenth\r\ncentury, when the modern commercial conditions were thoroughly\r\nestablished. The transition period was marked by the widening area of\r\ntrade, which was no longer restricted to the Mediterranean, the Black and\r\nthe North Seas, to the Baltic, and to the east coasts of Africa. The rigid\r\ngroups of artisans and traders—the guild system of the Middle Ages—began\r\nto dissolve, and to leave freer space for individual and new corporate\r\neffort. Prices were gradually freed from official regulation, and became\r\nsubject to the natural effects of bargaining. Adventure companies were\r\nstarted to share in the world-trade, and a beginning was made of dealing\r\non commissions. All these changes belong to the period of transition\r\nbetween the mediæval and the modern world.\r\n\r\nIn the art of governing men the Renaissance was the age of political\r\nconcentration. In two realms—Germany and Italy—the mediæval conceptions of\r\nEmperor and Pope, world-king and world-priest, were still strong enough to\r\nprevent the union of national forces under one political head; but there,\r\nalso, the principle of coalescence may be found in partial operation,—in\r\nGermany in the formation of great independent principalities, and in Italy\r\nin the growth of the States of the Church,—and its partial failure\r\nsubjected both nationalities to foreign oppression. Everywhere there was\r\nthe attempt to assert the claims of the secular powers to emancipate\r\nthemselves from clerical tutelage and ecclesiastical usurpation. While,\r\nunderlying all, there was the beginning of the assertion of the supreme\r\nright of individual revolt against every custom, law, or theory which\r\nwould subordinate the man to the caste or class. The Swiss peasantry began\r\nit when they made pikes by tying their scythes to their alpenstocks, and,\r\nstanding shoulder to shoulder at Morgarten and Sempach, broke the fiercest\r\ncharges of mediæval knighthood. They proved that man for man the peasant\r\nwas as good as the noble, and individual manhood asserted in this rude and\r\nbodily fashion soon began to express itself mentally and morally.\r\n\r\nIn jurisprudence the Renaissance may be described as the introduction of\r\nhistorical and scientific methods, the abandonment of legal fictions based\r\nupon collections of false decretals, the recovery of the true text of the\r\nRoman code, and the substitution of civil for canon law as the basis of\r\nlegislation and government. There was a complete break with the past. The\r\nsubstitution of civil law based upon the lawbooks of Justinian for the\r\ncanon law founded upon the Decretum of Gratian, involved such a breach in\r\ncontinuity that it was the most momentous of all the changes of that\r\nperiod of transition. For law enters into every human relation, and a\r\nthorough change of legal principles must involve a revolution which is\r\nnone the less real that it works almost silently. The codes of Justinian\r\nand of Theodosius completely reversed the teachings of the canonists, and\r\nthe civilian lawyers learned to look upon the Church as only a department\r\nof the State.\r\n\r\nIn literature there was the discovery of classical manuscripts, the\r\nintroduction of the study of Greek, the perception of the beauties of\r\nlanguage in the choice and arrangement of words under the guidance of\r\nclassical models. The literary powers of modern languages were also\r\ndiscovered,—Italian, English, French, and German,—and with the discovery\r\nthe national literatures of Europe came into being.\r\n\r\nIn art a complete revolution was effected in architecture, painting, and\r\nsculpture by the recovery of ancient models and the study of the\r\nprinciples of their construction.\r\n\r\nThe manufacture of paper, the discovery of the arts of printing and\r\nengraving, multiplied the possession of the treasures of the intelligence\r\nand of artistic genius, and combined to make art and literature\r\ndemocratic. What was once confined to a favoured few became common\r\nproperty. New thoughts could act on men in masses, and began to move the\r\nmultitude. The old mediæval barriers were broken down, and men came to see\r\nthat there was more in religion than the mediæval Church had taught, more\r\nin social life than feudalism had manifested, and that knowledge was a\r\nmanifold unknown to their fathers.\r\n\r\nIf the Renaissance be the transition from the mediæval to the modern\r\nworld,—and it is scarcely possible to regard it otherwise,—then it is one\r\nof those great movements of the mind of mankind that almost defy exact\r\ndescription, and there is an elusiveness about it which confounds us when\r\nwe attempt definition. “It was the emancipation of the reason,” says\r\nSymonds, “in a race of men, intolerant of control, ready to criticise\r\ncanons of conduct, enthusiastic of antique liberty, freshly awakened to\r\nthe sense of beauty, and anxious above all things to secure for themselves\r\nfree scope in spheres outside the region of authority. Men so vigorous and\r\nindependent felt the joy of exploration. There was no problem they feared\r\nto face, no formula they were not eager to recast according to their new\r\nconceptions.”(17) It was the blossoming and fructifying of the European\r\nintellectual life; but perhaps it ought to be added that it contained a\r\nnew conception of the universe in which religion consisted less in a\r\nfeeling of dependence on God, and more in a faith on the possibilities\r\nlying in mankind.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 2. The Revival of Literature and Art.\r\n\r\n\r\nBut the Renaissance has generally a more limited meaning, and one defined\r\nby the most potent of the new forces which worked for the general\r\nintellectual regeneration. It means the revival of learning and of art\r\nconsequent on the discovery and study of the literary and artistic\r\nmasterpieces of antiquity. It is perhaps in this more limited sense that\r\nthe movement more directly prepared the way for the Reformation and what\r\nfollowed, and deserves more detailed examination. It was the discovery of\r\na lost means of culture and the consequent awakening and diffusion of a\r\nliterary, artistic, and critical spirit.\r\n\r\nA knowledge of ancient Latin literature had not entirely perished during\r\nthe earlier Middle Ages. The Benedictine monasteries had preserved\r\nclassical manuscripts—especially the monastery of Monte Cassino for the\r\nsouthern, and that of Fulda for the northern parts of Europe. These\r\nmonasteries and their sister establishments were schools of learning as\r\nwell as libraries, and we read of more than one where the study of some of\r\nthe classical authors was part of the regular training. Virgil, Horace,\r\nTerence and Martial, Livy, Suetonius and Sallust, were known and studied.\r\nGreek literature had not survived to anything like the same extent, but it\r\nhad never entirely disappeared from Southern Europe, and especially from\r\nSouthern Italy. Ever since the days of the Roman Republic in that part of\r\nthe Italian peninsula once called Magna Græcia, Greek had been the\r\nlanguage of many of the common people, as it is to this day, in districts\r\nof Calabria and of Sicily; and the teachers and students of the mediæval\r\nUniversity of Salerno had never lost their taste for its study.(18) But\r\nwith all this, the fourteenth century, and notably the age of Petrarch,\r\nsaw the beginnings of new zeal for the literature of the past, and was\r\nreally the beginning of a new era.\r\n\r\nItaly was the first land to become free from the conditions of mediæval\r\nlife, and ready to enter on the new life which was awaiting Europe. There\r\nwas an Italian language, the feeling of distinct nationality, a\r\nconsiderable advance in civilisation, an accumulation of wealth, and,\r\nduring the age of the despots, a comparative freedom from constant changes\r\nin political conditions.\r\n\r\nDante’s great poem, interweaving as it does the imagery and mysticism of\r\nGiacchino di Fiore, the deepest spiritual and moral teaching of the\r\nmediæval Church, and the insight and judgment on men and things of a great\r\npoet, was the first sign that Italy had wakened from the sleep of the\r\nMiddle Ages. Petrarch came next, the passionate student of the lives, the\r\nthoughts, and emotions of the great masters of classical Latin literature.\r\nThey were real men for him, his own Italian ancestors, and they as he had\r\nfelt the need of Hellenic culture to solace their souls, and serve for the\r\nuniversal education of the human race. Boccaccio, the third leader in the\r\nawakening, preached the joy of living, the universal capacity for\r\npleasure, and the sensuous beauty of the world. He too, like Petrarch,\r\nfelt the need of Hellenic culture. For both there was an awakening to the\r\nbeauty of literary form, and the conviction that a study of the ancient\r\nclassics would enable them to achieve it. Both valued the vision of a new\r\nconception of life derived from the perusal of the classics, freer, more\r\nenlarged and joyous, more rational than the Middle Ages had witnessed.\r\nPetrarch and Boccaccio yearned after the life thus disclosed, which gave\r\nunfettered scope to the play of the emotions, to the sense of beauty, and\r\nto the manifold activity of the human intelligence.\r\n\r\nLearned Greeks were induced to settle in Italy—men who were able to\r\ninterpret the ancient Greek poets and prose writers—Manuel Chrysoloras (at\r\nFlorence, 1397-1400), George of Trebizond, Theodore Gaza (whose Greek\r\n_Grammar_ Erasmus taught from while in England), Gemistos Plethon, a\r\ndistinguished Platonist, under whom the Christian Platonism received its\r\nimpulse, and John Argyropoulos, who was the teacher of Reuchlin. The men\r\nof the early Renaissance were their pupils.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 3. Its earlier relation to Christianity.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere was nothing hostile to Christianity or to the mediæval Church in the\r\nearlier stages of this intellectual revival, and very little of the\r\nneo-paganism which it developed afterwards. Many of the instincts of\r\nmediæval piety remained, only the objects were changed. Petrarch revered\r\nthe MS. of Homer, which he could not read, as an ancestor of his might\r\nhave venerated the scapulary of a saint.(19) The men of the early\r\nRenaissance made collections of MSS. and inscriptions, of cameos and of\r\ncoins, and worshipped them as if they had been relics. The Medicean\r\nLibrary was formed about 1450, the Vatican Library in 1453, and the age of\r\npassionate collection began.\r\n\r\nThe age of scholarship succeeded, and Italian students began to interpret\r\nthe ancient classical authors with a mysticism all their own. They sought\r\na means of reconciling Christian thought with ancient pagan philosophy,\r\nand, like Clement of Alexandria and Origen, discovered it in Platonism.\r\nPlatonic academies were founded, and Cardinal Bessarion, Marsiglio Ficino,\r\nand Pico della Mirandola became the Christian Platonists of Italy. Of\r\ncourse, in their enthusiasm they went too far. They appropriated the whole\r\nintellectual life of a pagan age, and adopted its ethical as well as its\r\nintellectual perceptions, its basis of sensuous pleasures, and its joy in\r\nsensuous living. Still their main thought was to show that Hellenism as\r\nwell as Judaism was a pathway to Christianity, and that the Sibyl as well\r\nas David was a witness for Christ.\r\n\r\nThe Papacy lent its patronage to the revival of literature and art, and\r\nput itself at the head of the movement of intellectual life. Pope Nicolas\r\nV. (1447-1455) was the first Bishop of Rome who fostered the Renaissance,\r\nand he himself may be taken as representing the sincerity, the simplicity,\r\nand the lofty intellectual and artistic aims of its earliest period.\r\nSprung from an obscure family belonging to Saranza, a small town near\r\nSpezzia, and cast on his own resources before he had fairly quitted\r\nboyhood, he had risen by his talents and his character to the highest\r\nposition in the Church. He had been private tutor, secretary, librarian,\r\nand through all a genuine lover of books. They were the only personal\r\nluxury he indulged in, and perhaps no one in his days knew more about\r\nthem. He was the confidential adviser of Lorenzo de Medici when he founded\r\nhis great library in San Marco. He himself began the Vatican Library. He\r\nhad agents who ransacked the monasteries of Europe, and he collected the\r\nliterary relics which had escaped destruction in the sack of\r\nConstantinople. Before his death his library in the Vatican contained more\r\nthan 5000 MSS. He gathered round him a band of illustrious artists and\r\nscholars. He filled Rome with skilled and artistic artisans, with\r\ndecorators, jewellers, workers in painted glass and embroidery. The famous\r\nLeo Alberti was one of his architects, and Fra Angelico one of his\r\nartists. Laurentius Valla and Poggio Bracciolini, Cardinal Bessarion and\r\nGeorge of Trebizond, were among his scholars. He directed and inspired\r\ntheir work. Valla’s critical attacks on the Donation of Constantine, and\r\non the tradition that the Twelve had dictated the Apostles’ Creed, did not\r\nshake his confidence in the scholar. The principal Greek authors were\r\ntranslated into Latin by his orders. Europe saw theology, learning, and\r\nart lending each other mutual support under the leadership of the head of\r\nthe Church. Perhaps Julius II. (1503-1513) conceived more definitely than\r\neven Nicolas had done that one duty of the head of the Church was to\r\nassume the leadership of the intellectual and artistic movement which was\r\nmaking wider the thought of Europe,—only his restless energy never\r\npermitted him leisure to give effect to his conception. “The instruction\r\nwhich Pope Julius II. gave to Michelangelo to represent him as Moses can\r\nbear but one interpretation: that Julius set himself the mission of\r\nleading forth Israel (the Church) from its state of degradation, and\r\nshowing it—though he could not grant possession—the Promised Land at least\r\nfrom afar, that blessed land which consists in the enjoyment of the\r\nhighest intellectual benefits, and the training and consecration of all\r\nthe faculties of man’s mind to union with God.”(20)\r\n\r\nThe classical revival in Italy soon exhausted itself. Its sensuous\r\nperceptions degenerated into sensuality, its instinct for the beauty of\r\nexpression into elegant trifling, and its enthusiasm for antiquity into\r\nneo-paganism. It failed almost from the first in real moral earnestness;\r\nscarcely saw, and still less understood, how to cure the deep-seated moral\r\nevils of the age.\r\n\r\nItaly had given birth to the Renaissance, but it soon spread to the more\r\nnorthern lands. Perhaps France first felt the impulse, then Germany and\r\nEngland last of all. In dealing with the Reformation, the movement in\r\nGermany is the most important.\r\n\r\nThe Germans, throughout the Middle Ages, had continuous and intimate\r\nrelations with the southern peninsula, and in the fifteenth century these\r\nwere stronger than ever. German merchants had their factories in Venice\r\nand Genoa; young German nobles destined for a legal or diplomatic career\r\nstudied law at Italian universities; students of medicine completed their\r\nstudies in the famous southern schools; and the German wandering student\r\nfrequently crossed the Alps to pick up additional knowledge. There was\r\nsuch constant scholarly intercourse between Germany and Italy, that the\r\nNew Learning could not fail to spread among the men of the north.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 4. The Brethren of the Common Lot.\r\n\r\n\r\nGermany and the Low Countries had been singularly prepared for that\r\nrevival of letters, art, and science which had come to Italy. One of the\r\ngreatest gifts bestowed by the Mystics of the fourteenth and fifteenth\r\ncenturies on their native land had been an excellent system of school\r\neducation. Gerard Groot, a disciple of the Flemish mystic Jan van\r\nRysbroeck, had, after long consultations with his Master, founded a\r\nbrotherhood called the _Brethren of the Common Life_,(21) whose aim was to\r\nbetter the religious condition of their fellow-men by the multiplication\r\nof good books and by the careful training of the young. They were to\r\nsupport themselves by copying and selling manuscripts. All the houses of\r\nthe Brethren had a large room, where a number of scribes sat at tables, a\r\nreader repeated slowly the words of the manuscript, and books were\r\nmultiplied as rapidly as was possible before the invention of printing.\r\nThey filled their own libraries with the best books of Christian and pagan\r\nantiquity. They multiplied small tracts containing the mystical and\r\npractical theology of the _Friends of God_, and sent them into circulation\r\namong the people. One of the intimate followers of Groot, Florentius\r\nRadewynsohn, proved to be a distinguished educationalist, and the schools\r\nof the Order soon became famous. The Brethren, to use the words of their\r\nfounder, employed education for the purpose of “raising spiritual pillars\r\nin the Temple of the Lord.” They insisted on a study of the Vulgate in\r\ntheir classes; they placed German translations of Christian authors in the\r\nhands of their pupils; they took pains to give them a good knowledge of\r\nLatin, and read with them selections from the best known ancient authors;\r\nthey even taught a little Greek; and their scholars learned to sing the\r\nsimpler, more evangelical Latin hymns.\r\n\r\nThe mother school was at Deventer, a town situated at the south-west\r\ncorner of the great episcopal territory of Utrecht, now the Dutch province\r\nof Ober-Yessel. It lies on the bank of that branch of the Rhine (the\r\nYessel) which flowing northwards glides past Zutphen, Deventer, Zwolle,\r\nand loses itself in the Zuyder Zee at Kampen. A large number of the more\r\ndistinguished leaders of the fifteenth century owed their early training\r\nto this great school at Deventer. During the last decades of the fifteenth\r\ncentury the headmaster was Alexander Hegius (1433-1498), who came to\r\nDeventer in 1471 and remained there until his death.(22) The school\r\nreached its height of fame under this renowned master, who gathered 2000\r\npupils around him,—among them Erasmus, Conrad Mutti (Mutianus Rufus),\r\nHermann von Busch, Johann Murmellius,—and, rejecting the older methods of\r\ngrammatical instruction, taught them to know the niceties of the Latin\r\ntongue by leading them directly to the study of the great writers of\r\nclassical antiquity. He was such an indefatigable student that he kept\r\nhimself awake during the night-watches, it is said, by holding in his\r\nhands the candle which lighted him, in order to be wakened by its fall\r\nshould slumber overtake him. The glory of Deventer perished with this\r\ngreat teacher, who to the last maintained the ancient traditions of the\r\nschool by his maxim, that learning without piety was rather a curse than a\r\nblessing.\r\n\r\nOther famous schools of the Brethren in the second half of the fifteenth\r\ncentury were Schlettstadt,(23) in Elsass, some miles from the west bank of\r\nthe Rhine, and about half-way between Strassburg and Basel; Munster on the\r\nEms, the Monasterium of the earlier Middle Ages; Emmerich, a town on the\r\nRhine near the borders of Holland, and Altmarck, in the north-west.\r\nSchlettstadt, under its master Ludwig Dringenberg, almost rivalled the\r\nfame of Deventer, and many of the members of the well-known Strassburg\r\ncircle which gathered round Jacob Wimpheling, Sebastian Brand, and the\r\nGerman Savonarola, John Geiler von Keysersberg, had been pupils in this\r\nschool. Besides these more famous establishments, the schools of the\r\nBrethren spread all over Germany. The teachers were commonly called the\r\n_Roll-Brueder_, and under this name they had a school in Magdeburg to\r\nwhich probably Luther was sent when he spent a year in that town. Their\r\nwork was so pervading and their teaching so effectual, that we are\r\ninformed by chroniclers, who had nothing to do with the Brethren, that in\r\nmany German towns, girls could be heard singing the simpler Latin hymns,\r\nand that the children of artisans could converse in Latin.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 5. German Universities, Schools, and Scholarship.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe desire for education spread all over Germany in the fifteenth century.\r\nPrinces and burghers vied with each other in erecting seats of learning.\r\nWithin one hundred and fifty years no fewer than seventeen new\r\nuniversities were founded. Prag, a Bohemian foundation, came into\r\nexistence in 1348. Then followed four German foundations, Vienna, in 1365\r\nor 1384; Heidelberg, in 1386; Köln, in 1388; and Erfurt, established by\r\nthe townspeople, in 1392. In the fifteenth century there were Leipzig, in\r\n1409; Rostock, on the shore of what was called the East Sea, almost\r\nopposite the south point of Sweden, in 1419; Cracow, a Polish foundation,\r\nin 1420; Greifswald, in 1456; Freiburg and Trier, in 1457; Basel, in 1460;\r\nIngolstadt, founded with the special intention of training students in\r\nobedience to the Pope, a task singularly well accomplished, in 1472;\r\nTübingen and Mainz, in 1477; Wittenberg, in 1502; and\r\nFrankfurt-on-the-Oder, in 1507. Marburg, the first Reformation University,\r\nwas founded in 1527.\r\n\r\nThe craving for education laid hold on the burgher class, and towns vied\r\nwith each other in providing superior schools, with teachers paid out of\r\nthe town’s revenues. Some German towns had several such foundations.\r\nBreslau, “the student’s paradise,” had seven. Nor was the education of\r\ngirls neglected. Frankfurt-on-the-Main founded a high school for girls\r\nearly in the fifteenth century, and insisted that the teachers were to be\r\nlearned ladies who were not nuns.(24) Besides the classrooms, the towns\r\nusually provided hostels, where the boys got lodging and sometimes\r\nfirewood (they were expected to obtain food by begging through the streets\r\nof the town), and frequently hospitals where the scholars could be tended\r\nin illness.(25)\r\n\r\nThese possibilities of education attracted boys from all parts of the\r\ncountry, and added a new class of vagrants to the tramps of all kinds who\r\ninfested the roads during the later Middle Ages. The wandering scholar,\r\nwith his yellow scarf, was a feature of the era, and frequently not a\r\nreputable one. He was usually introduced as a character into the\r\n_Fastnachtspiele_, or rude popular carnival comedies, and was almost\r\nalways a rogue and often a thief. Children of ten and twelve years of age\r\nleft their villages, in charge of an older student, to join some famous\r\nschool. But these older students were too often mere vagrants, with just\r\nlearning enough to impose upon the simple peasantry, to whom they sold\r\ncharms against toothache and other troubles. The young children entrusted\r\nto them by confiding parents were often treated with the greatest cruelty,\r\nemployed by them to beg or steal food, and sent round to the public-houses\r\nwith cans to beg for beer. The small unfortunates were the prisoners, the\r\nslaves, of their disreputable masters, and many of them died by the\r\nroadside. We need not wonder that Luther, with his memory full of these\r\nwandering students, in after days denounced the system by which men spent\r\nsometimes “twenty and even forty years” in a so-called student life, which\r\nwas often one of the lowest vagrancy and debauchery, and in the end knew\r\nneither German nor Latin, “to say nothing,” he adds with honest\r\nindignation, “of the shameful and vicious life by which our worthy youth\r\nhave been so grievously corrupted.” Two or three of the autobiographies of\r\nthese wandering students have survived; and two of them, those of Thomas\r\nPlatter and of Johann Butzbach, belong to Luther’s time, and give a vivid\r\npicture of their lives.(26)\r\n\r\nGermany had no lack of schools and universities, but it can scarcely be\r\nsaid that they did more than serve as a preparation for the entrance of\r\nthe Renaissance movement. During the fifteenth century all the\r\nUniversities were under the influence of the Church, and Scholasticism\r\nprescribed the methods of study. Very little of the New Learning was\r\nallowed to enter. It is true that if Köln and perhaps Ingolstadt be\r\nexcepted, the Scholastic which was taught represented what were supposed\r\nto be the more advanced opinions—those of John Duns Scotus, William of\r\nOccam, and Gabriel Biel, rather than the learning of Thomas Aquinas and\r\nother great defenders of papal traditions; but it lent itself as\r\nthoroughly as did the older Scholastic to the discussion of all kinds of\r\nverbal and logical subtleties. Knowledge of every kind was discussed under\r\nformulæ and phrases sanctioned by long scholastic use. It is impossible to\r\ndescribe the minute distinctions and the intricate reasoning based upon\r\nthem without exceeding the space at our disposal. It is enough to say that\r\nthe prevailing course of study furnished an imposing framework without\r\nmuch solid content, and provided an intellectual gymnastic without much\r\nreal knowledge. A survival can be seen in the Formal Logic still taught.\r\nThe quantity of misspent ingenuity called forth to produce the figures and\r\nmoods, and bestowed on discovering and arranging all possible moods under\r\neach figure and in providing all with mnemonic names,—_Barbara, Celarent,\r\nDarii, Ferioque prioris_, etc.,—affords some insight into the scholastic\r\nmethods in use in these universities of the fifteenth century.\r\n\r\nThen it must be remembered that the scholarship took a\r\nquasi-ecclesiastical form. The universities were all monastic\r\ninstitutions, where the teachers were professional and the students\r\namateur celibates. The scholars were gathered into hostels in which they\r\nlived with their teachers, and were taught to consider themselves very\r\nsuperior persons. The statutes of mediæval Oxford declare that God created\r\n“clerks” with gifts of intelligence denied to mere lay persons; that it\r\nbehoved “clerks” to exhibit this difference by their outward appearance;\r\nand that the university tailors, whose duty it was to make men\r\n_extrinsecus_ what God had made them _intrinsecus_, were to be reckoned as\r\nmembers of the University. Those mediæval students sometimes assumed airs\r\nwhich roused the passions of the laity, and frequently led to tremendous\r\nriots. Thus in 1513 the townsfolk of Erfurt battered in the gates of the\r\nUniversity with cannon, and after the flight of the professors and\r\nstudents destroyed almost all the archives and library. About the same\r\ntime some citizens of Vienna having jeered at the sacred student dress,\r\nthere ensued the “Latin war,” which literally devastated the town. This\r\npride of separation between “clerks” and laity culminated in the great\r\nannual procession, when the newly capped graduates, clothed in all the\r\nglory of new bachelors’ and masters’ gowns and hoods, marched through the\r\nprincipal streets of the university town, in the midst of the university\r\ndignitaries and frequently attended by the magistrates in their robes.\r\nYoung Luther confessed that when he first saw the procession at Erfurt he\r\nthought that no position on earth was more enviable than that of a newly\r\ncapped graduate.\r\n\r\nMediæval ecclesiastical tradition brooded over all departments of\r\nlearning; and the philosophy and logic, or what were supposed to be the\r\nphilosophy and logic, of Aristotle ruled that tradition. The reverence for\r\nthe name of Aristotle almost took the form of a religious fervour. In a\r\ncurious mediæval _Life of Aristotle_ the ancient pagan thinker is declared\r\nto be a forerunner of Christ. All who refused to accept his guidance were\r\nheretics, and his formal scheme of thought was supposed to justify the\r\nrefined sophisms of mediæval dialectic. His system of thought was the\r\nfortified defence which preserved the old and protected it from the\r\ninroads of the New Learning. Hence the hatred which almost all the German\r\nHumanists seem to have had for the name of Aristotle. The attitudes of the\r\npartisans of the old and of the new towards the ancient Greek thinker are\r\nrepresented in two pictures, each instinct with the feeling of the times.\r\nIn one, in the church of the Dominicans in Pisa, Aristotle is represented\r\nstanding on the right with Plato on the left of Thomas Aquinas, and rays\r\nstreaming from their opened books make a halo round the head of the great\r\nmediæval theologian and thinker. In the other, a woodcut published by Hans\r\nHolbein the younger in 1527, Aristotle with the mediæval doctors is\r\nrepresented descending into the abodes of darkness, while Jesus Christ\r\nstands in the foreground and points out the true light to a crowd of\r\npeople, among whom the artist has figured peasants with their flails.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 6. The earlier German Humanists.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen the beginnings of the New Learning made their appearance in Germany,\r\nthey did not bring with them any widespread revival of culture. There was\r\nno outburst, as in Italy, of the artistic spirit, stamping itself upon\r\nsuch arts as painting, sculpture, and architecture, which could appeal to\r\nthe whole public intelligence. The men who first felt the stirrings of the\r\nnew intellectual life were, for the most part, students who had been\r\ntrained in the more famous schools of the _Brethren of the Common Life_,\r\nall of whom had a serious aim in life. The New Learning appealed to them\r\nnot so much a means of self-culture as an instrument to reform education,\r\nto criticise antiquated methods of instruction, and, above all, to effect\r\nreforms in the Church and to purify the social life. One of the most\r\nconspicuous of such scholars was Cardinal Nicolas Cusanus(27) (1401-1464).\r\nHe was a man of singularly open mind, who, while he was saturated with the\r\nold learning, was able to appreciate the new. He had studied the classics\r\nin Italy. He was an expert mathematician and astronomer. Some have even\r\nasserted that he anticipated the discoveries of Galileo. The instruments\r\nwith which he worked, roughly made by a village tinsmith, may still be\r\nseen preserved in the Brother-house which he founded at his birthplace,\r\nCues, on the Mosel; and there, too, the sheets, covered with his long\r\ncalculations for the reform of the calendar, may still be studied.\r\n\r\nAnother scholar, sent out by the same schools, was John Wessel of\r\nGröningen (1420-1489), who wandered in search of learning from Köln to\r\nParis and from Paris to Italy. He finally settled down as a canon in the\r\nBrotherhood of Mount St. Agnes. There he gathered round him a band of\r\nyoung students, whom he encouraged to study Greek and Hebrew. He was a\r\ntheologian who delighted to criticise the current opinions on theological\r\ndoctrines. He denied that the fire of Purgatory could be material fire,\r\nand he theorised about indulgences in such a way as to be a forerunner of\r\nLuther.(28) “If I had read his books before,” said Luther, “my enemies\r\nmight have thought that Luther had borrowed everything from Wessel, so\r\ngreat is the agreement between our spirits. I feel my joy and my strength\r\nincrease, I have no doubt that I have taught aright, when I find that one\r\nwho wrote at a different time, in another clime, and with a different\r\nintention, agrees so entirely in my view and expresses it in almost the\r\nsame words.”\r\n\r\nOther like-minded scholars might be mentioned, Rudolph Agricola(29)\r\n(1442-1485), Jacob Wimpheling(30) (1450-1528), and Sebastian Brand\r\n(1457-1521), who was town-clerk of Strassburg from 1500, and the author of\r\nthe celebrated _Ship of Fools_, which was translated into many languages,\r\nand was used by his friend Geiler of Keysersberg as the text for one of\r\nhis courses of popular sermons.\r\n\r\nAll these men, and others like-minded and similarly gifted, are commonly\r\nregarded as the precursors of the German Renaissance, and are classed\r\namong the German Humanists. Yet it may be questioned whether they can be\r\ntaken as the representatives of that kind of Humanism which gathered round\r\nLuther in his student days, and of which Ulrich von Hutten, the stormy\r\npetrel of the times of the Reformation, was a notable example. Its\r\nbeginnings must be traced to other and less reputable pioneers. Numbers of\r\nyoung German students, with the talent for wandering and for supporting\r\nthemselves by begging possessed by so many of them, had tramped down to\r\nItaly, where they contrived to exist precariously while they attended,\r\nwith a genuine thirst for learning, the classes taught by Italian\r\nHumanists. There they became infected with the spirit of the Italian\r\nRenaissance, and learned also to despise the ordinary restraints of moral\r\nliving. There they imbibed a contempt for the Church and for all kinds of\r\ntheology, and acquired the genuine temperament of the later Italian\r\nHumanists, which could be irreligious without being anti-religious, simply\r\nbecause religion of any sort was something foreign to their nature.\r\n\r\nSuch a man was Peter Luders (1415-1474). He began life as an ecclesiastic,\r\nwandered down into Italy, where he devoted himself to classical studies,\r\nand where he acquired the irreligious disposition and the disregard for\r\nordinary moral living which disgraced a large part of the later Italian\r\nHumanists. While living at Padua (1444), where he acted as private tutor\r\nto some young Germans from the Palatinate, he was invited by the Elector\r\nto teach Latin in the University of Heidelberg. The older professors were\r\njealous of him: they insisted on reading and revising his introductory\r\nlecture: they refused him the use of the library; and in general made his\r\nlife a burden. He struggled on till 1460. Then he spent many years in\r\nwandering from place to place, teaching the classics privately to such\r\nscholars as he could find. He was not a man of reputable life, was greatly\r\ngiven to drink, a free liver in every way, and thoroughly irreligious,\r\nwith a strong contempt for all theology. He seems to have contrived when\r\nsober to keep his heretical opinions to himself, but to have betrayed\r\nhimself occasionally in his drinking bouts. When at Basel he was accused\r\nof denying the doctrine of Three Persons in the Godhead, and told his\r\naccusers that he would willingly confess to four if they would only let\r\nhim alone. He ended his days as a teacher of medicine in Vienna.\r\n\r\nHistory has preserved the names of several of these wandering scholars who\r\nsowed the seeds of classical studies in Germany, and there were,\r\ndoubtless, many who have been forgotten. Loose living, irreligious, their\r\none gift a genuine desire to know and impart a knowledge of the ancient\r\nclassical literature, careless how they fared provided only they could\r\nstudy and teach Latin and Greek, they were the disreputable apostles of\r\nthe New Learning, and in their careless way scattered it over the northern\r\nlands.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 7. The Humanist Circles in the Cities.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe seed-beds of the German Renaissance were at first not so much the\r\nUniversities, as associations of intimates in some of the cities. Three\r\nwere pre-eminent,—Strassburg, Augsburg, and Nürnberg,—all wealthy imperial\r\ncities, having intimate relations with the imperial court on the one hand\r\nand with Italy on the other.\r\n\r\nThe Humanist circle at Nürnberg was perhaps the most distinguished, and it\r\nstood in closer relations than any other with the coming Reformation. Its\r\nbest known member was Willibald Pirkheimer(31) (1470-1528), whose training\r\nhad been more that of a young Florentine patrician than of the son of a\r\nGerman burgher. His father, a wealthy Nürnberg merchant of great\r\nintellectual gifts and attainments, a skilled diplomatist, and a\r\nconfidential friend of the Emperor Maximilian, superintended his son’s\r\neducation. He took the boy with him on the journeys which trade or the\r\ndiplomatic business of his city compelled him to make, and initiated him\r\ninto the mysteries of commerce and of German politics. The lad was also\r\ntrained in the knightly accomplishments of horsemanship and the skilful\r\nuse of weapons. He was sent, like many a young German patrician, to Padua\r\nand Pavia (1490-1497) to study jurisprudence and the science of diplomacy,\r\nand was advised not to neglect opportunities to acquire the New Learning.\r\nWhen he returned, in his twenty-seventh year, he was appointed one of the\r\ncounsellors of the city, and was entrusted with an important share in the\r\nmanagement of its business. In this capacity it was necessary for him to\r\nmake many a journey to the Diet or to the imperial court, and he soon\r\nbecame a favourite with the Emperor Maximilian, who rejoiced in converse\r\nwith a mind as versatile as his own. No German so nearly approached the\r\nmany-sided culture of the leading Italian Humanists as did this citizen of\r\nNürnberg. On the other hand, he possessed a fund of earnestness which no\r\nItalian seems to have possessed. He was deeply anxious about reformation\r\nin Church and State, and after the Leipzig disputation had shown that\r\nLuther’s quarrel with the Pope was no mere monkish dispute, but went to\r\nthe roots of things, he was a sedate supporter of the Reformation in its\r\nearlier stages. His sisters Charitas and Clara, both learned ladies, were\r\nnuns in the Convent of St. Clara at Nürnberg. The elder, who was the\r\nabbess of her convent, has left an interesting collection of letters, from\r\nwhich it seems probable that she had great influence over her brother, and\r\nprevented him from joining the Lutheran Church after it had finally\r\nseparated from the Roman obedience.\r\n\r\nPirkheimer gave the time which was not occupied with public affairs to\r\nlearning and intercourse with scholars. His house was a palace filled with\r\nobjects of art. His library, well stocked with MSS. and books, was open to\r\nevery student who came with an introduction to its owner. At his banquets,\r\nwhich were famous, he delighted to assemble round his table the most\r\ndistinguished men of the day. He was quite at home in Greek, and made\r\ntranslations from the works of Plato, Xenophon, Plutarch, and Lucian into\r\nLatin or German. The description which he gives, in his familiar letters\r\nto his sisters and intimate friends, of his life on his brother-in-law’s\r\ncountry estate is like a picture of the habits of a Roman patrician of the\r\nfifth century in Gaul. The morning was spent in study, in reading Plato or\r\nCicero; and in the afternoon, if the gout chanced to keep him indoors, he\r\nwatched from his windows the country people in the fields, or the\r\nsportsman and the fisher at their occupations. He was fond of entertaining\r\nvisitors from the neighbourhood. Sometimes he gathered round him his upper\r\nservants or his tenants, with their wives and families. The evening was\r\nusually devoted to the study of history and archæology, in both of which\r\nhe was greatly interested. He was in the habit of sitting up late at\r\nnight, and when the sky was clear he followed the motions of the planets\r\nwith a telescope; for, like many others in that age, he had faith in\r\nastrology, and believed that he could read future events and the destinies\r\nof nations in the courses of the wandering stars.\r\n\r\nIn all those civic circles, poets and artists were found as members—Hans\r\nHolbein at Augsburg; Albert Dürer, with Hans Sebaldus Beham, at Nürnberg.\r\nThe contemporary Italian painters, when they ceased to select their\r\nsubjects from Scripture or from the Lives of the Saints, turned\r\ninstinctively to depict scenes from the ancient pagan mythology. The\r\nGerman artists strayed elsewhere. They turned for subjects to the common\r\nlife of the people. But the change was gradual. The Virgin ceased to be\r\nthe Queen of Heaven and became the purest type of homely human motherhood,\r\nand the attendant angels, sportive children plucking flowers, fondling\r\nanimals, playing with fruit. In Lucas Cranach’s “Rest on the Flight to\r\nEgypt” two cherubs have climbed a tree to rob a bird’s nest, and the\r\nparent birds are screaming at them from the branches. In one of Albert\r\nDürer’s representations of the Holy Family, the Virgin and Child are\r\nseated in the middle of a farmyard, surrounded by all kinds of rural\r\naccessories. Then German art plunged boldly into the delineation of the\r\nordinary commonplace life—knights and tournaments, merchant trains, street\r\nscenes, pictures of peasant life, and especially of peasant dances,\r\nuniversity and school scenes, pictures of the camp and of troops on the\r\nmarch. The coming revolution in religion was already proclaiming that all\r\nhuman life, even the most commonplace, could be sacred; and contemporary\r\nart discovered the picturesque in the ordinary life of the people—in the\r\ncastles of the nobles, in the markets of the cities, and in the villages\r\nof the peasants.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 8. Humanism in the Universities.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe New Learning made its way gradually into the Universities. Classical\r\nscholars were invited to lecture or settle as private teachers in\r\nuniversity towns, and the students read Cicero and Virgil, Horace and\r\nPropertius, Livy and Sallust, Plautus and Terence. One of the earliest\r\nsigns of the growing Humanist feeling appeared in changes in one of the\r\nfavourite diversions of German students. In all the mediæval Universities\r\nat carnival time the students got up and performed plays. The subjects\r\nwere almost invariably taken from the Scriptures or from the Apocrypha.\r\nChaucer says of an Oxford student, that\r\n\r\n\r\n    “Sometimes to shew his lightnesse and his mastereye\r\n    He played Herod on a gallows high.”\r\n\r\n\r\nAt the end of the fifteenth century the subjects changed, and students’\r\nplays were either reproductions from Plautus or Terence, or original\r\ncompositions representing the common life of the time.\r\n\r\nThe legal recognition of Humanism within a University commonly showed\r\nitself in the institution of a lectureship of Poetry or Oratory—for the\r\nGerman Humanists were commonly known as the “Poets.” Freiburg established\r\na chair of Poetry in 1471, and Basel in 1474; in Tübingen the stipend for\r\nan Orator was legally sanctioned in 1481, and Conrad Celtis was appointed\r\nto a chair of Poetry and Eloquence in 1492.\r\n\r\nErfurt, however, was generally regarded as the special nursery of German\r\nuniversity Humanism ever since Peter Luders had taught there in 1460. From\r\nthat date the University never lacked Humanist teachers, and a Humanist\r\ncircle had gradually grown up among the successive generations of\r\nstudents. The permanent chief of this circle was a German scholar, whose\r\nname was Conrad Mut (Mudt, Mutta, and Mutti are variations), who Latinised\r\nhis name into Mutianus, and added Rufus because he was red-haired. This\r\nMutianus Rufus was in many respects a typical German Humanist. He was born\r\nin 1472 at Homburg in Hesse, had studied at Deventer under Alexander\r\nHegius, had attended the University of Erfurt, and had then gone to Italy\r\nto study law and the New Learning. He became a Doctor of Laws of Bologna,\r\nmade friends among many of the distinguished Italian Humanists, and had\r\ngained many patrons among the cardinals in Rome. He finally settled in\r\nGotha, where he had received a canonry in the Church. He did not win any\r\ndistinction as an author, but has left behind him an interesting\r\ncollection of letters. His great delight was to gather round him promising\r\nyoung students belonging to the University of Erfurt, to superintend their\r\nreading, and to advise them in all literary matters. While in Italy he had\r\nbecome acquainted with Pico della Mirandola, and had adopted the\r\nconception of combining Platonism and Christianity in an eclectic\r\nmysticism, which was to be the esoteric Christianity for thinkers and\r\neducated men, while the popular Christianity, with its superstitions, was\r\nneeded for the common herd. Christianity, he taught, had its beginnings\r\nlong before the historical advent of our Lord. “The true Christ,” he said,\r\n“was not a man, but the Wisdom of God; He was the Son of God, and is\r\nequally imparted to the Jews, the Greeks, and the Germans.”(32) “The true\r\nChrist is not a man, but spirit and soul, which do not manifest themselves\r\nin outward appearance, and are not to be touched or seized by the\r\nhands.”(33) “The law of God,” he said in another place, “which enlightens\r\nthe soul, has two heads: to love God, and to love one’s neighbour as one’s\r\nself. This law makes us partakers of Heaven. It is a natural law; not hewn\r\nin stone, as was the law of Moses; not carved in bronze, as was that of\r\nthe Romans; not written on parchment or paper, but implanted in our hearts\r\nby the highest Teacher.” “Whoever has eaten in pious manner this memorable\r\nand saving Eucharist, has done something divine. For the true Body of\r\nChrist is peace and concord, and there is no holier Host than neighbourly\r\nlove.”(34) He refused to believe in the miraculous, and held that the\r\nScriptures were full of fables, meant, like those of Æsop, to teach moral\r\ntruths. He asserted that he had devoted himself to “God, the saints, and\r\nthe study of all antiquity”; and the result was expressed in the following\r\nquotation from a letter to Urban (1505), one of his friends and pupils at\r\nErfurt: “There is but one god and one goddess; but there are many forms\r\nand many names—Jupiter, Sol, Apollo, Moses, Christ, Luna, Ceres,\r\nProserpina, Tellus, Mary. But do not spread it abroad; we must keep\r\nsilence on these Eleusinian mysteries. In religious matters we must employ\r\nfables and enigmas as a veil. Thou who hast the grace of Jupiter, the best\r\nand greatest God, shouldst in secret despise the little gods. When I say\r\nJupiter, I mean Christ and the true God. But enough of these things, which\r\nare too high for us.”(35) Such a man looked with contempt on the Church of\r\nhis age, and lashed it with his scorn. “I do not revere the coat or the\r\nbeard of Christ; I revere the true and living God, who has neither beard\r\nnor coat.”(36) In private he denounced the fasts of the Church,\r\nconfession, and masses for the dead, and called the begging friars “cowled\r\nmonsters.” He says sarcastically of the Christianity of his times: “We\r\nmean by faith not the conformity of what we say with fact, but an opinion\r\nabout divine things founded on credulity and a persuasion which seeks\r\nafter profit. Such is its power that it is commonly believed that to us\r\nwere given the keys of the kingdom of heaven. Whoever, therefore, despises\r\nour keys, shall feel our nails and our clubs (_quisquis claves contemserit\r\nclavum et clavam sentiet_). We have taken from the breast of Serapis a\r\nmagical stamp to which Jesus of Galilee has given authority. With that\r\nfigure we put our foes to flight, we cozen money, we consecrate God, we\r\nshake hell, and we work miracles; whether we be heavenly minded or earthly\r\nminded makes no matter, provided we sit happily at the banquet of\r\nJupiter.”(37) But he did not wish to revolt from the external authority of\r\nthe Church of the day. “He is impious who wishes to know more than the\r\nChurch. We bear on our forehead,” he says, “the seal of the Cross, the\r\nstandard of our King. Let us not be deserters; let nothing base be found\r\nin our camp.”(38) The authority which the Humanists revolted against was\r\nmerely intellectual, as was the freedom they fought for. It did not belong\r\nto their mission to proclaim a spiritual freedom or to free the common man\r\nfrom his slavish fear of the mediæval priesthood; and this made an\r\nimpassable gulf between their aspirations and those of Luther and the real\r\nleaders of the Reformation movement.(39)\r\n\r\nThe Erfurt circle of Humanists had for members Heinrich Urban, to whom\r\nmany of the letters of Mutianus were addressed, Petreius Alperbach, who\r\nwon the title of “mocker of gods and men” (_derisor deorum et hominum_),\r\nJohann Jaeger of Dornheim (Crotus Rubeanus), George Burkhardt from Spalt\r\n(Spalatinus), Henry and Peter Eberach. Eoban of Hesse (Helius Eobanus\r\nHessus), the most gifted of them all, and the hardest drinker, joined the\r\ncircle in 1494.\r\n\r\nSimilar university circles were formed elsewhere: at Basel, where Heinrich\r\nLoriti from Glarus (Glareanus), and afterwards Erasmus, were the\r\nattractions; at Tübingen, where Heinrich Bebel, author of the _Facetiæ_,\r\nencouraged his younger friends to study history; and even at Köln, where\r\nHermann von Busch, a pupil of Deventer, and Ortuin Gratius, afterwards the\r\nbutt of the authors of the _Epistolæ obscurorum virorum_, were looked upon\r\nas leaders full of the New Learning.\r\n\r\nAs in Italy Popes and cardinals patronised the leaders of the Renaissance,\r\nso in Germany the Emperor and some princes gave their protection to\r\nHumanism. To German scholars, who were at the head of the new movement,\r\nMaximilian seemed to be an ideal ruler. His coffers no doubt were almost\r\nalways empty, and he had not lucrative posts at his command to bestow upon\r\nthem; the position of court poet given to Conrad Celtes and afterwards to\r\nUlrich von Hutten brought little except coronation in presence of the\r\nimperial court with a tastefully woven laurel crown;(40) but the character\r\nof Maximilian attracted peasantry and scholars alike. His romanticism, his\r\nabiding youthfulness, his amazing intellectual versatility, his\r\nknight-errantry, and his sympathy fascinated them. Maximilian lives in the\r\nfolk-song of Germany as no other ruler does. The scheme of education sung\r\nin the _Weisskunig_, and illustrated by Hans Burgmaier, entitled him to\r\nthe name “the Humanist Emperor.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 9. Reuchlin.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe German Humanists, whether belonging to the learned societies of the\r\ncities or to the groups in the Universities, were too full of\r\nindividuality to present the appearance of a body of men leagued together\r\nunder the impulse of a common aim. The Erfurt band of scholars was called\r\n“the Mutianic Host”; but the partisans of the New Learning could scarcely\r\nbe said to form a solid phalanx. Something served, however, to bring them\r\nall together. This was the persecution of Reuchlin.\r\n\r\nJohann Reuchlin (1455-1522), like Erasmus after him, was very much a man\r\nby himself. He entered history at first dramatically enough. A party of\r\nItalian Humanists had met in the house of John Argyropoulos in Rome in\r\n1483. Among them was a young unknown German, who had newly arrived with\r\nletters of introduction to the host. He had come, he explained, to study\r\nGreek. Argyropoulos gave him a Thucydides and asked him to construe a page\r\nor two into Latin. Reuchlin construed with such ease and elegance, that\r\nthe company exclaimed that Greece had flown across the Alps to settle in\r\nGermany. The young German spent some years in Italy, enjoying the\r\nfriendship of the foremost Italian scholars. He was an ardent student of\r\nthe New Learning, and on his return was the first to make Greek thoroughly\r\npopular in Germany. But he was a still more ardent student of Hebrew, and\r\nit may almost be said of him that he introduced that ancient language to\r\nthe peoples of Europe. His _De Rudimentis Hebraicis_ (1506), a grammar and\r\ndictionary in one, was the first book of its kind. His interest in the\r\nlanguage was more than that of a student. He believed that Hebrew was not\r\nonly the most ancient, but the holiest of languages. God had spoken in it.\r\nHe had revealed Himself to men not merely in the Hebrew writings of the\r\nOld Testament, but had also imparted, through angels and other divine\r\nmessengers, a hidden wisdom which has been preserved in ancient Hebrew\r\nwritings outside of the Scriptures,—a wisdom known to Adam, to Noah, and\r\nto the Patriarchs. He expounded his strange mystical theosophy in a\r\ncurious little book, _De Verbo Mirifico_ (1494), full of out-of-the-way\r\nlearning, and finding sublime mysteries in the very points of the Hebrew\r\nScriptures. Perhaps his central thought is expressed in the sentence, “God\r\nis love; man is hope; the bond between them is faith.... God and man may\r\nbe so combined in an indescribable union that the human God and the divine\r\nman may be considered as one being.”(41) The book is a _Symposium_ where\r\nSidonius, Baruch, and Capnion (Reuchlin) hold prolonged discourse with\r\neach other.\r\n\r\nReuchlin was fifty-four years of age when a controversy began which\r\ngradually divided the scholars of Germany into two camps, and banded the\r\nHumanists into one party fighting in defence of free inquiry.\r\n\r\nJohn Pfefferkorn (1469-1522), born a Jew and converted to Christianity\r\n(1505), animated with the zeal of a convert to bring the Jews wholesale to\r\nChristianity, and perhaps stimulated by the Dominicans of Köln (Cologne),\r\nwith whom he was closely associated, conceived an idea that his former\r\nco-religionists might be induced to accept Christianity if all their\r\npeculiar books, the Old Testament excepted, were confiscated. During the\r\nearlier Middle Ages the Jews had been continually persecuted, and their\r\npersecution had always been popular; but the fifteenth century had been a\r\nperiod of comparative rest for them; they had bought the imperial\r\nprotection, and their services as physicians had been gratefully\r\nrecognised in Frankfurt and many other cities.(42) Still the popular\r\nhatred against them as usurers remained, and manifested itself in every\r\ntime of social upheaval. It was always easy to arouse the slumbering\r\nantipathy.\r\n\r\nPfefferkorn had written four books against the Jews (_Judenspiegel_,\r\n_Judenbeichte_, _Osternbuch_, _Jeudenfeind_) in the years 1507-1509, in\r\nwhich he had suggested that the Jews should be forbidden to practise\r\nusury, that they should be compelled to listen to sermons, and that their\r\nHebrew books should be confiscated. He actually got a mandate from the\r\nEmperor Maximilian, probably through some corrupt secretary, empowering\r\nhim to seize upon all such books. He began his work in the Rhineland, and\r\nhad already confiscated the books of many Jews, when, in the summer of\r\n1509, he came to Reuchlin and requested his aid. The scholar not only\r\nrefused, but pointed out some irregularities in the imperial mandate. The\r\ndoubtful legality of the imperial order had also attracted the attention\r\nof Uriel, the Archbishop of Mainz, who forbade his clergy from rendering\r\nPfefferkorn any assistance.\r\n\r\nUpon this Pfefferkorn and the Dominicans again applied to the Emperor, got\r\na second mandate, then a third, which was the important one. It left the\r\nmatter in the hands of the Archbishop of Mainz, who was to collect\r\nevidence on the subject of Jewish books. He was to ask the opinions of\r\nReuchlin, of Victor von Karben (1422-1515), who had been a Jew but was\r\nthen a Christian priest, of James Hochstratten (1460-1527), a Dominican\r\nand Inquisitor to the diocese of Köln, a strong foe to Humanism, and of\r\nthe Universities of Heidelberg, Erfurt, Köln, and Mainz. They were to\r\nwrite out their opinions and send them to Pfefferkorn, who was to present\r\nthem to the Emperor. Reuchlin was accordingly asked by the Archbishop to\r\nadvise the Emperor “whether it would be praiseworthy and beneficial to our\r\nholy religion to destroy such books as the Jews used, excepting only the\r\nbooks of the Ten Commandments of Moses, the Prophets, and the Psalter of\r\nthe Old Testament?” Reuchlin’s answer was ready by November 1510. He went\r\ninto the matter very thoroughly and impartially. He divided the books of\r\nthe Jews into several classes, and gave his opinion on each. It was out of\r\nthe question to destroy the Old Testament. The Talmud was a collection of\r\nexpositions of the Jewish law at various periods; no one could express an\r\nopinion about it unless he had read it through; Reuchlin had only been\r\nable to procure portions; judging from these, it was likely that the book\r\ndid contain many things contrary to Christianity, but that was the nature\r\nof the Jewish religion which was protected by law; it did contain many\r\ngood things, and ought not to be destroyed. The Cabala was, according to\r\nReuchlin, a very precious book, which assured us as no other did of the\r\ndivinity of Christ, and ought to be carefully preserved. The Jews had\r\nvarious commentaries on the books of the Old Testament which were very\r\nuseful to enable Christian scholars to understand them rightly, and they\r\nought not to be destroyed. They had also sermons and ceremonial books\r\nbelonging to their religion which had been guaranteed by imperial law.\r\nThey had books on arts and sciences which ought to be destroyed only in so\r\nfar as they taught such forbidden arts as magic. Lastly, there were books\r\nof poetry and fables, and some of them might contain insults to Christ,\r\nthe Virgin, and the Apostles, and might deserve burning, but not without\r\ncareful and competent examination. He added that the best way to deal with\r\nthe Jews was not to burn their books, but to engage in reasonable, gentle,\r\nand kindly discussion.\r\n\r\nReuchlin’s opinion stood alone: all the other authorities suggested the\r\nburning of Jewish books, and the University of Mainz would not exempt the\r\nOld Testament until it had been shown that it had not been tampered with\r\nby Jewish zealots.\r\n\r\nThe temperate and scholarly answer of Reuchlin was made a charge against\r\nhim. The controversy which followed, and which lasted for six weary years,\r\nwas so managed by the Dominicans, that Reuchlin, a Humanist and a layman,\r\nwas made to appear as defying the theologians of the Church on a point of\r\ntheology. Like all mediæval controversies, it was conducted with great\r\nbitterness and no lack of invective, frequently coarse enough. The\r\nHumanists saw, however, that it was the case of a scholar defending\r\ngenuine scholarship against obscurantists, and, after a fruitless\r\nendeavour to get Erasmus to lead them, they joined in a common attack.\r\nArtists also lent their aid. In one contemporary engraving, Reuchlin is\r\nseated in a car decked with laurels, and is in the act of entering his\r\nnative town of Pforzheim. The Köln theologians march in chains before the\r\ncar; Pfefferkorn lies on the ground with an executioner ready to\r\ndecapitate him; citizens and their wives in gala costume await the hero,\r\nand the town’s musicians salute him with triumphant melody; while one\r\nworthy burgher manifests his sympathy by throwing a monk out of a window.\r\nThe other side of the controversy is represented by a rough woodcut, in\r\nwhich Pfefferkorn is seen breaking the chair of scholarship in which a\r\ndouble-tongued Reuchlin is sitting.(43) The most notable contribution to\r\nthe dispute, however, was the publication of the famous _Epistolæ\r\nObscurorum Virorum_, inseparably connected with the name of Ulrich von\r\nHutten.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 10. The “Epistolæ Obscurorum Virorum.”\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile the controversy was raging (1514), Reuchlin had collected a series\r\nof testimonies to his scholarship, and had published them under the title\r\nof _Letters from Eminent Men_.(44) This suggested to some young Humanist\r\nthe idea of a collection of letters in which the obscurantists could be\r\nseen exposing themselves and their unutterable folly under the parodied\r\ntitle of _Epistolæ Obscurorum Virorum_. The book bears the same relation\r\nto the scholastic disputations of the later fifteenth century that _Don\r\nQuixote_ does to the romances of mediæval chivalry. It is a farrago of\r\nquestions on grammar, etymology, graduation precedence, life in a country\r\nparsonage, and scholastic casuistry. Magister Henricus Schaffsmulius\r\nwrites from Rome that he went one Friday morning to breakfast in the Campo\r\ndei Fiori, ordered an egg, which on being opened contained a chicken.\r\n“Quick,” said his companion, “swallow it, or the landlord will charge the\r\nchicken in the bill.” He obeyed, forgetting that the day was Friday, on\r\nwhich no flesh could be eaten lawfully. In his perplexity he consulted one\r\ntheologian, who told him to keep his mind at rest, for an embryo chicken\r\nwithin an egg was like the worms or maggots in fruit and cheese, which men\r\ncan swallow without harm to their souls even in Lent. But another, equally\r\nlearned, had informed him that maggots in cheese and worms in fruit were\r\nto be classed as fish, which everyone could eat lawfully on fast days, but\r\nthat an embryo chicken was quite another thing—it was flesh. Would the\r\nlearned Magister Ortuin, who knew everything, decide for him and relieve\r\nhis burdened conscience? The writers send to their dear Magister Ortuin\r\nshort Latin poems of which they are modestly proud. They confess that\r\ntheir verses do not scan; but that matters little. The writers of secular\r\nverse must be attentive to such things; but their poems, which relate the\r\nlives and deeds of the saints, do not need such refinements. The writers\r\nconfess that at times their lives are not what they ought to be; but\r\nSolomon and Samson were not perfect; and they have too much Christian\r\nhumility to wish to excel such honoured Christian saints. The letters\r\ncontain a good deal of gossip about the wickedness of the poets\r\n(Humanists). These evil men have been speaking very disrespectfully about\r\nthe Holy Coat at Trier (Treves); they have said that the Blessed Relics of\r\nthe Three Kings at Köln are the bones of three Westphalian peasants. The\r\ncorrespondents exchange confidences about sermons they dislike. One\r\npreacher, who spoke with unseemly earnestness, had delivered a plain\r\nsermon without any learned syllogisms or intricate theological reasoning;\r\nhe had spoken simply about Christ and His salvation, and the strange thing\r\nwas that the people seemed to listen to him eagerly: such preaching ought\r\nto be forbidden. Allusions to Reuchlin and his trial are scattered all\r\nthrough the letters, and the writers reveal artlessly their hopes and\r\nfears about the result. It is possible, one laments, that the rascal may\r\nget off after all: the writer hears that worthy Inquisitor Hochstratten’s\r\nmoney is almost exhausted, and that he has scarcely enough left for the\r\nnecessary bribery at Rome; it is to be hoped that he will get a further\r\nsupply. It is quite impossible to translate the epistles and retain the\r\noriginal flavour of the language,—a mixture of ecclesiastical phrases,\r\nvernacular idioms and words, and the worst mediæval Latin. Of course, the\r\nletters contain much that is very objectionable: they attack the character\r\nof men, and even of women; but that was an ordinary feature of the\r\nHumanism of the times. They were undoubtedly successful in covering the\r\nopponents of Reuchlin with ridicule, more especially when some of the\r\nobscurantists failed to see the satire, and looked upon the letters as\r\ngenuine accounts of the views they sympathised with. Some of the mendicant\r\nfriars in England welcomed a book against Reuchlin, and a Dominican prior\r\nin Brabant bought several copies to send to his superiors.\r\n\r\nThe authorship of these famous letters is not thoroughly known; probably\r\nseveral Humanist pens were at work. It is generally admitted that they\r\ncame from the Humanist circle at Erfurt, and that the man who planned the\r\nbook and wrote most of the letters was John Jaeger of Dornheim (Crotus\r\nRubeanus). They were long ascribed to Ulrich von Hutten; some of the\r\nletters may have come from his pen—one did certainly. These _Epistolæ\r\nObscurorum Virorum_, when compared with the _Encomium Moriæ_ of Erasmus,\r\nshow how immeasurably inferior the ordinary German Humanist was to the\r\nscholar of the Low Countries.(45)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 11. Ulrich von Hutten.\r\n\r\n\r\nUlrich von Hutten,(46) the stormy petrel of the Reformation period in\r\nGermany, was a member of one of the oldest families of the Franconian\r\nnobles—a fierce, lawless, turbulent nobility. The old hot family blood\r\ncoursed through his veins, and accounts for much in his adventurous\r\ncareer. He was the eldest son, but his frail body and sickly disposition\r\nmarked him out in his father’s eyes for a clerical life. He was sent at\r\nthe age of eleven to the ancient monastery of Fulda, where his precocity\r\nin all kinds of intellectual work seemed to presage a distinguished\r\nposition if he remained true to the calling to which his father had\r\ndestined him. The boy, however, soon found that he had no vocation for the\r\nChurch, and that, while he was keenly interested in all manner of studies,\r\nhe detested the scholastic theology. He appealed to his father, told him\r\nhow he hated the thought of a clerical life, and asked him to be permitted\r\nto look forward to the career of a scholar and a man of letters. The old\r\nFranconian knight was as hard as men of his class usually were. He\r\npromised Ulrich that he could take as much time as he liked to educate\r\nhimself, but that in the end he was to enter the Church. Upon this,\r\nUlrich, an obstinate chip of an obstinate block, determined to make his\r\nescape from the monastery and follow his own life. How he managed it is\r\nunknown. He fell in with John Jaeger of Dornheim, and the two wandered,\r\nGerman student fashion, from University to University; they were at Köln\r\ntogether, then at Erfurt. The elder Hutten refused to assist his son in\r\nany way. How the young student maintained himself no one knows. He had\r\nwretched health; he was at least twice robbed and half-murdered by\r\nruffians as he tramped along the unsafe highways; but his indomitable\r\npurpose to live the life of a literary man or to die sustained him. At\r\nlast family friends patched up a half-hearted reconciliation between\r\nfather and son. They pointed out that the young man’s abilities might find\r\nscope in a diplomatic career since the Church was so distasteful to him,\r\nand the father was induced to permit him to go to Italy, provided he\r\napplied himself to the study of law. Ulrich went gladly to the land of the\r\nNew Learning, reached Pavia, struggled on to Bologna, found that he liked\r\nlaw no better than theology, and began to write. It is needless to follow\r\nhis erratic career. He succeeded frequently in getting patrons; but he was\r\nnot the man to live comfortably in dependence; he always remembered that\r\nhe was a Franconian noble; he had an irritable temper,—his wretched health\r\nfurnishing a very adequate excuse.\r\n\r\nIt is probable that his sojourn in Italy did as much for him as for\r\nLuther, though in a different way. The Reformer turned with loathing from\r\nItalian, and especially from Roman wickedness. The Humanist meditated on\r\nthe greatness of the imperial idea, now, he thought, the birthright of his\r\nGermany, which was being robbed of it by the Papacy. Henceforward he was\r\ndominated by one persistent thought.\r\n\r\nHe was a Humanist and a poet, but a man apart, marked out from among his\r\nfellows, destined to live in the memories of his nation when their names\r\nhad been forgotten. They might be better scholars, able to write a finer\r\nLatinity, and pen trifles more elegantly; but he was a man with a purpose.\r\nHis erratic and by no means pure life was ennobled by his sincere, if\r\nlimited and unpractical, patriotism. He wrought, schemed, fought,\r\nflattered, and apostrophised to create a united Germany under a reformed\r\nEmperor. Whatever hindered this was to be attacked with what weapons of\r\nsarcasm, invective, and scorn were at his command; and the _one_ enemy was\r\nthe Papacy of the close of the fifteenth century, and all that it implied.\r\nIt was the Papacy that drained Germany of gold, that kept the Emperor in\r\nthraldom, that set one portion of the land against the other, that gave\r\nthe separatist designs of the princes their promise of success. The Papacy\r\nwas his Carthage, which must be destroyed.\r\n\r\nHutten was a master of invective, fearless, critically destructive; but he\r\nhad small constructive faculty. It is not easy to discover what he meant\r\nby a reformation of the Empire—something loomed before him vague, grand, a\r\nrenewal of an imagined past. Germany might be great, it is suggested in\r\nthe _Inspicientes_ (written in 1520), if the Papacy were defied, if the\r\nprinces were kept in their proper place of subordination, if a great\r\nimperial army were created and paid out of a common imperial fund,—an army\r\nwhere the officers were the knights, and the privates a peasant infantry\r\n(_landsknechts_). It is the passion for a German Imperial Unity which we\r\nfind in all Hutten’s writings, from the early _Epistola ad Maximilianum\r\nCæsarem Italiæ fictitia_, the _Vadiscus, or the Roman Triads_, down to the\r\n_Inspicientes_—not the means whereby this is to be created. He was a born\r\nfoeman, one who loved battle for battle’s sake, who could never get enough\r\nof fighting,—a man with the blood of his Franconian ancestors coursing\r\nhotly through his veins. Like them, he loved freedom in all\r\nthings—personal, intellectual, and religious. Like them, he scorned ease\r\nand luxury, and despised the burghers, with their love of comfort and\r\nwealth. He thought much more highly of the robber-knights than of the\r\nmerchants they plundered. Germany, he believed, would come right if the\r\nmerchants and the priests could be got rid of. The robbers were even\r\nGerman patriots who intercepted the introduction of foreign merchandise,\r\nand protected the German producers in securing the profits due to them for\r\ntheir labour.\r\n\r\nHutten is usually classed as an ally of Luther’s, and from the date of the\r\nLeipzig Disputation (1519), when Luther first attacked the Roman Primacy,\r\nhe was an ardent admirer of the Reformer. But he had very little sympathy\r\nwith the deeper religious side of the Reformation movement. He regarded\r\nLuther’s protest against Indulgences in very much the same way as did Pope\r\nLeo X. It was a contemptible monkish dispute, and all sensible men, he\r\nthought, ought to delight to see monks devour one another. “I lately said\r\nto a friar, who was telling me about it,” he writes, “ ‘Devour one\r\nanother, that ye may be consumed one of another.’ It is my desire that our\r\nenemies (the monks) may live in as much discord as possible, and may be\r\nalways quarrelling among themselves.” He attached himself vehemently to\r\nLuther (and Hutten was always vehement) only when he found that the monk\r\nstood for freedom of conscience (_The Liberty of a Christian Man_) and for\r\na united Germany against Rome (_To the Christian Nobility of the German\r\nNation respecting the Reformation of the Christian Estate_). As we study\r\nhis face in the engravings which have survived, mark his hollow cheeks,\r\nhigh cheek-bones, long nose, heavy moustache, shaven chin, whiskers\r\nstraggling as if frayed by the helmet, and bold eyes, we can see the rude\r\nFranconian noble, who by some strange freak of fortune became a scholar, a\r\nHumanist, a patriot, and, in his own way, a reformer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter IV. Social Conditions.(47)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 1. Towns and Trade.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt has been already said that the times of the Renaissance were a period\r\nof transition in the social as well as in the intellectual condition of\r\nthe peoples of Europe. The economic changes were so great, that no\r\ndescription of the environment of the Reformation would be complete\r\nwithout some account of the social revolution which was slowly\r\nprogressing. It must be remembered, however, that there is some danger in\r\nmaking the merely general statements which alone are possible in this\r\nchapter. The economic forces at work were modified and changed in\r\ncountries and in districts, and during decades, by local conditions. Any\r\ngeneral description is liable to be qualified by numerous exceptions.\r\n\r\nBeneath the whole mediæval system lay the idea that the land was the only\r\neconomic basis of wealth. During the earlier Middle Ages this was largely\r\ntrue everywhere, and was specially so in Germany. Each little district\r\nproduced almost all that it needed for its own wants; and the economic\r\nvalue of the town consisted in its being a corporation of artisans\r\nexchanging the fruits of their industries for the surplus of farm produce\r\nwhich the peasants brought to their market-place. But the increasing trade\r\nof the towns, developed at first along the greater rivers, the arteries of\r\nthe countries, gradually produced another source of wealth; and this\r\ncommerce made great strides after the Crusades had opened the Eastern\r\nmarkets to European traders. Trade, commerce, and manufactures were the\r\nlife of the towns, and were rapidly increasing their importance.\r\n\r\nIn mediæval times each town was an independent economic centre, and the\r\nregulation of industry and of trade was an exclusively municipal affair.\r\nThis state of matters had changed in some countries before the time of the\r\nReformation, and statesmen had begun to recognise the importance of a\r\nnational trade, and to take steps to further it; but in Germany, chiefly\r\nowing to its hopeless divisions, the old state of matters remained, and\r\nthe municipalities continued to direct and control all commercial and\r\nindustrial affairs.\r\n\r\nThe towns had originally grown up under the protection of the Emperor, or\r\nof some great lord of the soil, or of an ecclesiastical prince or\r\nfoundation, and the early officials were the representatives of these\r\nfostering powers. The descendants of this early official class became\r\nknown as the “patricians” of the city, and they regarded all the official\r\npositions as the hereditary privileges of their class. The town population\r\nwas thoroughly organised in associations of workmen, commonly called\r\n“gilds,” which at first concerned themselves simply with the regulation\r\nand improvement of the industry carried on, and with the education and\r\nrecreations of the workers. But these “gilds” soon assumed a political\r\ncharacter. The workmen belonging to them formed the fighting force needed\r\nfor the independence and protection of the city. Each “gild” had its\r\nfighting organisation, its war banner, its armoury; and its members were\r\ntrained to the use of arms, and practised it in their hours of recreation.\r\nThe “gilds” therefore began to claim some share in the government of the\r\ntown, and in most German cities, in the decades before the Reformation,\r\nthe old aristocratic government of the “patricians” had given place to the\r\nmore democratic rule of the “gilds.” The chief offices connected with the\r\n“gilds” insensibly tended to become hereditary in a few leading families,\r\nand this created a second “patriciat,” whose control was resented by the\r\ngreat mass of the workmen. Nürnberg was one of the few great German cities\r\nwhere the old “patricians” continued to rule down to the times of the\r\nReformation.\r\n\r\nThese “gilds” were for the most part full of business energy, which showed\r\nitself in the twofold way of making such regulations as they believed\r\nwould insure good workmanship, and of securing facilities for the sale of\r\ntheir wares. All the workmen, it was believed, were interested in the\r\nproduction of good articles, and the bad workmanship of one artisan was\r\nregarded as bringing discredit upon all. Hence, as a rule, every article\r\nwas tested in private before it was exposed for public sale, and various\r\npunishments were devised to check the production of inferior goods. Thus\r\nin Bremen every badly made pair of shoes was publicly destroyed at the\r\npillory of the town. Such regulations belonged to the private\r\nadministration of the towns, and differed in different places. Indeed, the\r\nwhole municipal government of the German cities presents an endless\r\nvariety, due to the local history and other conditions affecting the\r\nindividual towns. While the production was a matter for private regulation\r\nin each centre of industry, distribution involved the towns in something\r\nlike a common policy. It demanded safe means of communication between one\r\ntown and another, between the towns and the rural districts, and safe\r\noutlets to foreign lands. It needed roads, bridges, and security of\r\ntravel. The towns banded themselves together, and made alliances with\r\npowerful feudal nobles to secure these advantages. Such was the origin of\r\nthe great Hanseatic League, which had its beginnings in Flanders, spread\r\nover North Germany, included the Scandinavian countries, and grew to be a\r\nEuropean power.(48) The less known leagues among the cities of South\r\nGermany did equally good service, and they commonly secured outlets to\r\nVenice, Florence, and Genoa, by alliances with the peasantry in whose\r\nhands were the chief passes of the Alps. All this meant an opposition\r\nbetween the burghers and the nobles—an opposition which was continuous,\r\nwhich on occasion flamed out into great wars, and which compelled the\r\ncities to maintain civic armies, composed partly of their citizens and\r\npartly of hired troops. It was reckoned that Strassburg and Augsburg\r\ntogether could send a fighting force of 40,000 men into the field.\r\n\r\nThe area of trade, though, according to modern ideas, restricted, was\r\nfairly extensive. It included all the countries in modern Europe and the\r\nadjacent seas. The sea-trade was carried on in the Mediterranean and Black\r\nSeas, in the Baltic and North Seas, and down the western coasts of France\r\nand Spain. The North Sea was the great fishing ground, and large\r\nquantities of dried fish, necessary for the due keeping of Lent, were\r\ndespatched in coasting vessels, and by the overland routes to the southern\r\ncountries of Europe. Furs, skins, and corn came from Russia and the\r\nnorthern countries. Spain, some parts of Germany, and above all England,\r\nwere the wool-exporting countries. The eastern counties of England, many\r\ntowns in Germany and France, and especially the Low Countries, were the\r\ncentres of the woollen manufactures. The north of France was the great\r\nflax-growing country. In Italy, at Barcelona in Spain, and at Lyons in\r\nFrance, silk was produced and manufactured. The spices and dried fruits of\r\nthe East, and its silks and costly brocades and feathers, came from the\r\nLevant to Venice, and were carried north through the great passes which\r\npierce the range of the Alps.\r\n\r\nCivic statesmen did their best, by mutual bargains and the establishment\r\nof factories, to protect and extend trading facilities for their townsmen.\r\nThe German merchant had his magnificent _Fondaco dei Tedeschi_ in Venice,\r\nhis factories of the Hanseatic League in London, Bruges, Bergen, and even\r\nin far-off Novgorod; and Englishmen had also their factories in foreign\r\nparts, within which they could buy and sell in peace.\r\n\r\nThe perils of the German merchant, in spite of all civic leagues, were at\r\nhome rather than abroad. His country swarmed with Free Nobles, each of\r\nwhom looked upon himself as a sovereign power, with full right to do as he\r\npleased within his own dominions, whether these were an extensive\r\nprincipality or a few hundred acres surrounding his castle. He could\r\nimpose what tolls or customs dues he pleased on the merchants whose\r\nheavily-laden waggons entered his territories. He had customary rights\r\nwhich made bad roads and the lack of bridges advantages to the lord of the\r\nsoil. If an axle or wheel broke, if a waggon upset in crossing a dangerous\r\nford, the bales thrown on the path or stranded on the banks of the stream\r\ncould be claimed by the proprietor of the land. Worse than all were the\r\nperils from the robber-knights—men who insisted on their right to make\r\nprivate war even when that took the form of highway robbery, and who\r\nlargely subsisted on the gains which came, as they said, from making their\r\n“horses bite off the purses of travellers.”\r\n\r\nIn spite of all these hindrances, a capitalist class gradually arose in\r\nGermany. Large profits, altogether apart from trade, could be made by\r\nmanaging, collecting, and forwarding the money coming from the universal\r\nsystem of Indulgences. It was in this way that the Fuggers of Augsburg\r\nfirst rose to wealth. Money soon bred money. During the greater part of\r\nthe Middle Ages there was no such thing as lending out money on interest,\r\nsave among the Italian merchants of North Italy or among the Jews. The\r\nChurch had always prohibited what it called usury. But Churchmen were the\r\nfirst to practise the sin they had condemned. The members of\r\necclesiastical corporations began to make useful advances, charging an\r\ninterest of from 7 to 12 per cent.—moderate enough for the times.\r\nGradually the custom spread among the wealthy laity, who did not confine\r\nthemselves to these reasonable profits, and we find Sebastian Brand\r\ninveighing against the “Christian Jews,” who had become worse oppressors\r\nthan the Israelite capitalists whom they copied.\r\n\r\nBut the great alteration in social conditions, following change in the\r\ndistribution of wealth, came when the age of geographical discovery had\r\nmade a world commerce a possible thing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 2. Geographical Discoveries and the beginning of a World Trade.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe fifteenth century from its beginning had seen one geographical\r\ndiscovery after another. Perhaps we may say that the sailors of Genoa had\r\nbegun the new era by reaching the Azores and Madeira. Then Dom Henrique of\r\nPortugal, Governor of Ceuta, organised voyages of trade and discovery down\r\nthe coast of Africa. Portuguese, Venetian, and Genoese captains commanded\r\nhis vessels. From 1426, expedition after expedition was sent forth, and at\r\nhis death in 1460 the coast of Africa as far as Guinea had been explored.\r\nHis work was carried on by his countrymen. The Guinea trade in slaves,\r\ngold, and ivory was established as early as 1480; the Congo was reached in\r\n1484; and Portuguese ships, under Bartholomew Diaz, rounded the Cape of\r\nGood Hope in 1486. During these later years a new motive had prompted the\r\nvoyages of exploration. The growth of the Turkish power in the east of\r\nEurope had destroyed the commercial colonies and factories on the Black\r\nSea; the fall of Constantinople had blocked the route along the valley of\r\nthe Danube; and Venice had a monopoly of the trade with Egypt and Syria,\r\nthe only remaining channels by which the merchandise from the East reached\r\nEurope. The great commercial problem of the times was how to get some hold\r\nof the direct trade with the East. It was this that inspired Bristol\r\nskippers, familiar with Iceland, with the idea that by following old Norse\r\ntraditions they might find a path by way of the North Atlantic; that sent\r\nColumbus across the Mid-Atlantic to discover the Bahamas and the continent\r\nof America; and that drove the more fortunate Portuguese round the Cape of\r\nGood Hope. Young Vasco da Gama reached the goal first, when, after\r\ndoubling the Cape, he sailed up the eastern coast of Africa, reached\r\nMombasa, and then boldly crossed the Indian Ocean to Calicut, the Indian\r\nemporium for that rich trade which all the European nations were anxious\r\nto share. The possibilities of a world commerce led to the creation of\r\ntrading companies; for a larger capital was needed than individual\r\nmerchants possessed, and the formation of these companies overshadowed,\r\ndiscredited, and finally destroyed the gild system of the mediæval trading\r\ncities. Trade and industry became capitalised to a degree previously\r\nunknown. One great family of capitalists, the Welser, had factories in\r\nRome, Milan, Genoa, and Lyons, and tapped the rich Eastern trade by their\r\nhouses in Antwerp, Lisbon, and Madeira. They even tried, unsuccessfully,\r\nto establish a German colony on the new continent—in Venezuela. Another,\r\nthe Fuggers of Augsburg, were interested in all kinds of trade, but\r\nespecially in the mining industry. It is said that the mines of Thuringia,\r\nCarinthia, and the Tyrol within Germany, and those of Hungary and Spain\r\noutside it, were almost all in their hands. The capital of the family was\r\nestimated in 1546 at sixty-three millions of gulden. This increase of\r\nwealth does not seem to have been confined to a few favourites of fortune.\r\nIt belonged to the mass of the members of the great trading companies. Von\r\nBezold instances a “certain native of Augsburg” whose investment of 500\r\ngulden in a merchant company brought him in seven years 24,500 gulden.\r\nMerchant princes confronted the princes of the State and those of the\r\nChurch, and their presence and power dislocated the old social relations.\r\nThe towns, the abodes of these rich merchants, acquired a new and powerful\r\ninfluence among the complex of national relations, until it is not too\r\nmuch to say, that if the political future of Germany was in the hands of\r\nthe secular princes, its social condition came to be dominated by the\r\nburgher class.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 3. Increase in Wealth and luxurious Living.\r\n\r\n\r\nCulture, which had long abandoned the cloisters, came to settle in the\r\ntowns. We have already seen that they were the centres of German Humanism\r\nand of the New Learning. The artists of the German Renaissance belonged to\r\nthe towns, and their principal patrons were the wealthy burghers. The rich\r\nmerchants displayed their civic patriotism in aiding to build great\r\nchurches; in erecting magnificent chambers of commerce, where merchandise\r\ncould be stored, with halls for buying and selling, and rooms where the\r\nmerchants of the town could consult about the interests of the civic\r\ntrade; in building _Artushöfe_ or assembly rooms, where the patrician\r\nburghers had their public dances, dinners, and other kinds of social\r\nentertainments; in raising great towers for the honour of the town. They\r\nbuilt magnificent private houses. Æneas Sylvius tells us that in Nürnberg\r\nhe saw many burgher houses that befitted kings, and that the King of\r\nScotland was not as nobly housed as a Nürnberg burgher of the second rank.\r\nThey filled these dwellings with gold and silver plate, and with costly\r\nVenetian glass; their furniture was adorned with delicate wood-carving;\r\ncostly tapestries, paintings, and engravings decorated the walls; and the\r\nreception-room or _stube_ was the place of greatest display. The towns in\r\nwhich all this wealth was accumulated were neither populous nor powerful.\r\nThey cannot be compared with the city republics of Italy, where the town\r\nruled over a large territory: the lands belonging to the imperial cities\r\nof Germany were comparatively of small extent. Nor could they boast of the\r\npopulation of the great cities of the Netherlands. Nürnberg, it is said,\r\nhad a population of a little over 20,000 in the middle of the fifteenth\r\ncentury. Strassburg, a somewhat smaller one. The population of\r\nFrankfurt-on-the-Main was about 10,000 in 1440.(49) The number of\r\ninhabitants had probably increased by one-half more in the decades\r\nimmediately preceding the Reformation. But all the great towns, with their\r\nelaborate fortifications, handsome buildings, and massive towers, had a\r\nvery imposing appearance in the beginning of the sixteenth century.\r\n\r\nThere was, however, another side to all this. There was very little\r\npersonal “comfort” and very little personal refinement among the rich\r\nburghers and nobles of Germany—much less than among the corresponding\r\nclasses in Italy, the Netherlands, and France. The towns were badly\r\ndrained, if drained at all; the streets were seldom paved, and mud and\r\nfilth accumulated in almost indescribable ways; the garbage was thrown out\r\nof the windows; and troops of swine were the ordinary scavengers. The\r\nincrease of wealth showed itself chiefly in all kinds of sensual living.\r\nPreachers, economists, and satirists denounce the luxury and immodesty of\r\nthe dress both of men and women, the gluttony and the drinking habits of\r\nthe rich burghers and of the nobility of Germany. We learn from Hans von\r\nSchweinichen that noblemen prided themselves on having men among their\r\nretainers who could drink all rivals beneath the table, and that noble\r\npersonages seldom met without such a drinking contest.(50) The wealthy,\r\nlearned, and artistic city of Nürnberg possessed a public waggon, which\r\nevery night was led through the streets to pick up and convey to their\r\nhomes drunken burghers found lying in the filth of the streets. The\r\n_Chronicle of the Zimmer Family_ relates that at the castle of Count\r\nAndrew of Sonnenberg, at the conclusion of a carnival dance and after the\r\nusual “sleeping drink” had been served round, one of the company went to\r\nthe kennels and carried to the ball-room buckets of scraps and slops\r\ngathered to feed the hounds, and that the lords and ladies amused\r\nthemselves by flinging the contents at each other, “to the great\r\ndetriment,” the chronicler adds, “of their clothes and of the room.”(51) A\r\nlike licence pervaded the relations between men and women, of which it\r\nwill perhaps suffice to say that the public baths, where, be it noted, the\r\nbathing was often promiscuous, were such that they served Albert Dürer and\r\nother contemporary painters the purpose of a “life school” to make\r\ndrawings of the nude.(52) The conversation and behaviour of the nobles and\r\nwealthy burghers of Germany in the decades before the Reformation\r\ndisplayed a coarseness which would now be held to disgrace the lowest\r\nclasses of the population in any country.(53)\r\n\r\nThe gradual capitalising of industry had been sapping the old “gild”\r\norganisation within the cities; the extension of commerce, and especially\r\nthe shifting of the centre of external trade from Venice to Antwerp, in\r\nconsequence of the discovery of the new route to the Eastern markets, and\r\nabove all, the growth of the great merchant companies, whose world-trade\r\nrequired enormous capital, overshadowed the “gilds” and destroyed their\r\ninfluence. The rise and power of this capitalist order severed the poor\r\nfrom the rich, and created, in a sense unknown before, a proletariat class\r\nwithin the cities, which was liable to be swollen by the influx of\r\ndiscontented and ruined peasants from the country districts. The\r\ncorruption of morals, which reached its height in the city life of the\r\nfirst quarter of the sixteenth century, intensified the growing hatred\r\nbetween the rich burgher and the poor workman. The ostentatious display of\r\nburgher wealth heightened the natural antipathy between merchant and\r\nnoble. The universal hatred of the merchant class is a pronounced feature\r\nof the times. “They increase prices, make hunger, and slay the poor folk,”\r\nwas a common saying. Men like Ulrich von Hutten were prepared to justify\r\nthe robber-knights because they attacked the merchants, who, he said, were\r\nruining Germany. Yet the merchant class increased and flourished, and with\r\nthem, the towns which they inhabited.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 4. The Condition of the Peasantry.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe condition of the peasantry in Germany has also to be described. The\r\nfolk who practise husbandry usually form the most stable element in any\r\ncommunity, but they could not avoid being touched by the economic\r\nmovements of the time. The seeds of revolution had long been sown among\r\nthe German peasantry, and peasant risings had taken place in different\r\ndistricts of south-central Europe from the middle of the fourteenth down\r\nto the opening years of the sixteenth centuries. It is difficult to\r\ndescribe accurately the state of these German peasants. The social\r\ncondition of the nobles and the burghers has had many an historian, and\r\ntheir modes of life have left abundant traces in literature and\r\narchæology; but peasant houses and implements soon perished, and the\r\nchronicles seldom refer to the world to which the “land-folk” belonged,\r\nsave when some local peasant rising or the tragedy of the Peasants’ War\r\nthrust them into history. Our main difficulty, however, does not arise so\r\nmuch from lack of descriptive material—for that can be found when\r\ndiligently sought for—as from the varying, almost contradictory statements\r\nthat are made. Some contemporary writers condescend to describe the\r\npeasant class. A large number of collections of _Weisthümer_, the\r\nconsuetudinary laws which regulated the life of the village communities,\r\nhave been recovered and carefully edited;(54) folk-songs preserve the old\r\nlife and usages; many of the _Fastnachtspiele_ or rude carnival dramas\r\ndeal with peasant scenes; and Albert Dürer and other artists of the times\r\nhave sketched over and over again the peasant, his house and cot-yard, his\r\nvillage and his daily life. We can, in part, reconstruct the old peasant\r\nlife and its surroundings. Only it must be remembered that the life varied\r\nnot only in different parts of Germany, but in the same districts and\r\ndecades under different rural proprietors; for the peasant was so\r\ndependent on his over-lord that the character of the proprietor counted\r\nfor much in the condition of the people.\r\n\r\nThe village artisan did not exist. The peasants lived by themselves apart\r\nfrom all other classes of the population. That is the universal statement.\r\nThey carried the produce of their land and their live-stock to the nearest\r\ntown, sold it in the market-place, and bought there what they needed for\r\ntheir life and work.\r\n\r\nThey dwelt in villages fortified after a fashion; for the group of houses\r\nwas surrounded sometimes by a wall, but usually by a stout fence, made\r\nwith strong stakes and interleaved branches. This was entered by a gate\r\nthat could be locked. Outside the fence, circling the whole was a deep\r\nditch crossed by a “falling door” or drawbridge. Within the fence among\r\nthe houses there was usually a small church, a public-house, a house or\r\nroom (_Spielhaus_) where the village council met and where justice was\r\ndispensed. In front stood a strong wooden stake, to which criminals were\r\ntied for punishment, and near it always the stocks, sometimes a gallows,\r\nand more rarely the pole and wheel for the barbarous mediæval punishment\r\n“breaking on the wheel.”\r\n\r\nThe houses were wooden frames filled in with sun-dried bricks, and were\r\nthatched with straw; the chimneys were of wood protected with clay. The\r\ncattle, fuel, fodder, and family were sheltered under the one large roof.\r\nThe timber for building and repairs was got from the forest under\r\nregulations set down in the _Weisthümer_, and the peasants had leave to\r\ncollect the fallen branches for firewood, the women gathering and\r\ncarrying, and the men cutting and stacking under the eaves. All breaches\r\nof the forest laws were severely punished (in some of the _Weisthümer_ the\r\nfelling of a tree without leave was punished by beheading); so was the\r\nmoving of landmarks; for wood and soil were precious.\r\n\r\nMost houses had a small fenced garden attached, in which were grown\r\ncabbages, greens, and lettuce; small onions (cibölle, _Scotticé_ syboes),\r\nparsley, and peas; poppies, garlic, and hemp; apples, plums, and, in South\r\nGermany, grapes; as well as other things whose mediæval German names are\r\nnot translatable by me. Wooden beehives were placed in the garden, and a\r\npigeon-house usually stood in the yard.\r\n\r\nThe scanty underclothing of the peasants was of wool and the outer dress\r\nof linen—the men’s, girt with a belt from which hung a sword, for they\r\nalways went armed. Their furniture consisted of a table, several\r\nthree-legged stools, and one or two chests. Rude cooking utensils hung on\r\nthe walls, and dried pork, fruits, and baskets of grain on the rafters.\r\nThe drinking-cups were of coarse clay; and we find regulations that the\r\ntable-cloth or covering ought to be washed at least once a year! Their\r\nordinary food was “some poor bread, oatmeal porridge, and cooked\r\nvegetables; and their drink, water and whey.” The live-stock included\r\nhorses, cows, goats, sheep, pigs, and hens.(55)\r\n\r\nThe villagers elected from among themselves four men, the _Bauernmeister_,\r\nwho were the Fathers of the community. They were the arbiters in disputes,\r\nsettled quarrels, and arranged for an equitable distribution of the\r\nvarious feudal assessments and services. They had no judicial or\r\nadministrative powers; these belonged to the over-lord, or a\r\nrepresentative appointed by him. This official sat in the justice room,\r\nheard cases, issued sentences, and exercised all the mediæval powers of\r\n“pit and gallows.” The whole list of mediæval punishments, ludicrous and\r\ngruesome, were at his command. It was he who ordered the scolding wife to\r\nbe carried round the church three times while her neighbours jeered; who\r\nset the unfortunate charcoal-burner, who had transgressed some forest law,\r\ninto the stocks, with his bare feet exposed to a slow fire till his soles\r\nwere thoroughly burnt; who beheaded men who cut down trees, and ordered\r\nmurderers to be broken on the wheel. He saw that the rents, paid in kind,\r\nwere duly gathered. He directed the forced services of ploughing, sowing,\r\nand harvesting the over-lord’s fields, what wood was to be hewn for the\r\ncastle, what ditches dug, and what roads repaired. He saw that the\r\npeasants drank no wine but what came from the proprietor’s vineyards, and\r\nthat they drank it in sufficient quantity; that they ground their grain at\r\nthe proprietor’s mill, and fired their bread at the estate bakehouse. He\r\nexacted the two most valuable of the moveable goods of a dead peasant—the\r\nhated “death-tax.” There was no end to his powers. Of course, according to\r\nthe _Weisthümer_, these powers were to be exercised in _customary_ ways;\r\nand in some parts of Germany the indefinite “forced services” had been\r\ncommuted to twelve days’ service in the year, and in others to the payment\r\nof a fixed rate in lieu of service.\r\n\r\nThis description of the peasant life has been taken entirely from the\r\n_Weisthümer_, and, for reasons to be seen immediately, it perhaps\r\nrepresents rather a “golden past” than the actual state of matters at the\r\nbeginning of the sixteenth century. It shows the peasants living in a\r\nstate of rude plenty, but for the endless exactions of their lords and the\r\ncontinual robberies to which they were exposed from bands of sturdy rogues\r\nwhich swarmed through the country, and from companies of soldiers, who\r\nthought nothing of carrying off the peasant’s cows, slaying his swine,\r\nmaltreating his womenkind, and even firing his house.\r\n\r\nThe peasants had their diversions, not always too seemly. On the days of\r\nChurch festivals, and they were numerous, the peasantry went to church and\r\nheard Mass in the morning, talked over the village business under the\r\nlime-trees, or in some open space near the village, and spent the\r\nafternoon in such amusements as they liked best—eating and drinking at the\r\npublic-house, and dancing on the village green. In one of his least known\r\npoems, Hans Sachs describes the scene—the girls and the pipers waiting at\r\nthe dancing-place, and the men and lads in the public-house eating calf’s\r\nhead, tripe, liver, black puddings, and roast pork, and drinking whey and\r\nthe sour country wine, until some sank under the benches; and there was\r\nsuch a jostling, scratching, shoving, bawling, and singing, that not a\r\nword could be heard. Then three young men came to the dancing-place, his\r\nsweetheart had a garland ready for one of them, and the dancing began;\r\nother couples joined, and at last sixteen pairs of feet were in motion.\r\nRough jests, gestures, and caresses went round.\r\n\r\n\r\n    “Nach dem der Messner von Hirschau,\r\n    Der tanzet mit des Pfarrhaus Frau\r\n    Von Budenheim, die hat er lieb,\r\n    Viel Scherzens am Tanz mit ihr trieb.”\r\n\r\n\r\nThe men whirled their partners off their feet and spun them round and\r\nround, or seized them by the waist and tossed them as high as they could;\r\nwhile they themselves leaped and threw out their feet in such reckless\r\nways that Hans Sachs thought they would all fall down.\r\n\r\nThe winter amusements gathered round the spinning house. For it was the\r\ncustom in most German villages for the young women to resort to a large\r\nroom in the mill, or to the village tavern, or to a neighbour’s house,\r\nwith their wool and flax, their distaffs and spindles, some of them old\r\nheirlooms and richly ornamented, to spin all evening. The lads came also\r\nto pick the fluff off the lasses’ dresses, they said; to hold the small\r\nbeaker of water into which they dipped their fingers as they span; and to\r\ncheer the spinsters with songs and recitations. After work came the\r\ndancing. On festival evenings, and especially at carnival times, the lads\r\ntreated their sweethearts to a late supper and a dance; and escorted them\r\nhome, carrying their distaffs and spindles.(56) All the old German love\r\nfolk-songs are full of allusions to this peasant courtship, and it is not\r\ntoo much to say that from the singing in the spinning house have come most\r\nof the oldest folk-songs.\r\n\r\nThese descriptions apply to the German peasants of Central and South\r\nGermany. In the north and north-east, the agricultural population, which\r\nwas for the most part of Slavonic descent, had been reduced by their\r\nconquerors to a serfdom which had no parallel in the more favoured\r\ndistricts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 5. Earlier Social Revolts.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was among the peasants of German descent that there had been risings,\r\nsuccessful and unsuccessful, for more than a century. The train for\r\nrevolution had been laid not where serfdom was at its worst, but where\r\nthere was ease enough in life to allow men to think, and where freedom was\r\nnearest in sight. It may be well to refer to the earlier peasant revolts,\r\nbefore attempting to investigate the causes of that permanent unrest which\r\nwas abundantly evident at the beginning of the sixteenth century.\r\n\r\nThe first great successful peasant rebellion was the fight for freedom\r\nmade by the people of the four forest cantons in Switzerland. The weapons\r\nwith which they overthrew the chivalry of Europe, rude pikes made by tying\r\ntheir scythes to their alpenstocks, may still be seen in the historical\r\nmuseums of Basel and Constance. They proved that man for man the peasant\r\nwas as good as the noble. The free peasant soldier had come into being.\r\nThese free peasants did not really secede from the Empire till 1499, and\r\nwere formally connected with it till 1648. The Emperor was still their\r\nover-lord. But they were his free peasants, able to form leagues for their\r\nmutual defence and for the protection of their rights. Other cantons and\r\nsome neighbouring cities joined them, and the Swiss Confederacy, with its\r\nflag, a white cross on a red ground, and its motto, “Each for all and all\r\nfor each,” became a new nation in Europe. During the next century\r\n(1424-1471) the peasants of the Rhætian Alps also won their freedom, and\r\nformed a confederacy similar to the Swiss, though separate from it. It was\r\ncalled the _Graubund_.\r\n\r\nThe example of these peasant republics, strong in the protection which\r\ntheir mountains gave them, fired the imagination of the German peasantry\r\nof the south and the south-west of the Empire, and the leaders of lost\r\npopular causes found a refuge in the Alpine valleys while they meditated\r\non fresh schemes to emancipate their followers. We have evidence of the\r\npopularity of the Swiss in the towns and country districts of Germany all\r\nthrough the fifteenth and into the sixteenth century.(57)\r\n\r\nBut while the social tumults and popular uprisings against authority,\r\nwhich are a feature of the close of the Middle Ages, are usually and\r\nrightly enough called peasant insurrections, the name tends to obscure\r\ntheir real character. They were rather the revolts of the poor against the\r\nrich, of debtors against creditors, of men who had scanty legal rights or\r\nnone at all against those who had the protection of the existing laws, and\r\nthey were joined by the poor of the towns as well as by the peasantry of\r\nthe country districts. The peasants generally began the revolt and the\r\ntownsmen followed; but this was not always the case. Sometimes the mob of\r\nthe cities rose first and the peasants joined afterwards. In many cases,\r\ntoo, the poorer nobles were in secret or open sympathy with the\r\ninsurrectionary movement. On more than one occasion they led the\r\ninsurgents and fought at their head. The union of poor nobles and peasants\r\nhad made the Bohemian revolt successful.\r\n\r\nIt must also be remembered that from the end of the fourteenth century on\r\nto the beginning of the sixteenth, however varied the cries and watchwords\r\nof the insurgents may be, one persistent note of detestation of the\r\npriests (the _pfaffen_) is always heard; and, from the way in which Jews\r\nand priests are continually linked together in one common denunciation, it\r\nmay be inferred that the hatred arose more from the intolerable pressure\r\nof clerical extortion than from any feeling of irreligion. The tithes,\r\ngreat and small, and the means taken to exact them, were a galling burden.\r\n“The priests,” says an English writer, “have their tenth part of all the\r\ncorn, meadows, pasture, grass, wood, colts, lambs, geese, and chickens.\r\nOver and besides the tenth part of every servant’s wages, wool, milk,\r\nhoney, wax, cheese, and butter; yea, and they look so narrowly after their\r\nprofits that the poor wife must be countable to them for every tenth egg,\r\nor else she getteth not her rights at Easter, and shall be taken as a\r\nheretic.” As matter of fact, many of these tithes, extorted in the name of\r\nthe Church, did not go into the pockets of the clergy at all, but were\r\nseized by the feudal superior and went to increase his revenues. Popular\r\nfeeling, however, seldom discriminates, and feudal and clerical dues were\r\nregarded as belonging to one system of intolerable oppression. Besides,\r\nthe rapacity of Churchmen went far beyond the exaction of the tithes. “I\r\nsee,” said a Spaniard, “that we can scarcely get anything from Christ’s\r\nministers but for money; at baptism money, at bishoping money, at marriage\r\nmoney, for confession money—no, not extreme unction without money! They\r\nwill ring no bells without money, no burial in the church without money;\r\nso that it seemeth that Paradise is shut up from them that have no money.\r\nThe rich is buried in the church, the poor in the churchyard. The rich man\r\nmay marry with his nearest kin, but the poor not so, albeit he be ready to\r\ndie for love of her. The rich may eat flesh in Lent, but the poor may not,\r\nalbeit fish perhaps be much dearer. The rich man may readily get large\r\nIndulgences, but the poor none, because he wanteth money to pay for\r\nthem.”(58)\r\n\r\nIn spite of this hatred of the priests, it will be found that almost every\r\ninsurrectionary movement was impregnated by some sentiment of enthusiastic\r\nreligion, with which was blended some confused dream that the kingdom of\r\nGod might be set up on earth, if only the priests were driven out of the\r\nland. This religious element drew some of its strength from the Lollard\r\nmovement in England and from the Taborite in Bohemia, but after 1476 it\r\nhad a distinctly German character. Its connection with what may almost be\r\ncalled the epidemic of pilgrimages, the strongly increased veneration for\r\nthe Blessed Virgin, and the injunctions laid upon the confederates in some\r\nof the revolutionary movements to repeat so many _Pater Nosters_ and _Ave\r\nMarias_, seem to lead to the conclusion that much of that revival of an\r\nenthusiastic and superstitious religion which marked the last half of the\r\nfifteenth century may be regarded as an attempt to create a popular\r\nreligion apart from priests and clergy of all kinds.\r\n\r\nOne of the earliest of these popular uprisings occurred at Gotha in 1391,\r\nwhen the peasantry of the neighbourhood and many of the burghers of the\r\ntown rose against the exactions of the Jews, and demanded their expulsion.\r\nIt was an insurrection of debtors against usurers, and was in the end put\r\ndown by the majority of the citizens. From this date onwards to 1470\r\nsimilar risings took place in many parts of Germany, prompted by the same\r\nor like causes—the exactions of Jews, priests, or nobles. The years\r\n1431-1432 saw a great Hussite propaganda carried on all over Europe.\r\nCountries were flooded with Hussite proclamations, and traversed by\r\nHussite emissaries. Paul Crawar was sent to Scotland, and others like him\r\nto Spain, to the Netherlands, and to East Prussia. They taught among other\r\nthings that the Old Testament law about tithes had no place within the\r\nChristian Church, and that Christian tithes were originally free-will\r\nofferings,—a statement peculiarly acceptable to the German peasantry. All\r\nGermany had learnt by this time how Bohemian peasants, trained and led by\r\nmen belonging to the lesser nobility, had routed in two memorable\r\ncampaigns the imperial armies led by the Emperor himself, and how they had\r\nbegun even to invade Germany. The chroniclers speak of the anxiety of the\r\ngoverning classes, civic and rural, when they recognised the strength of\r\nthe feelings excited by this propaganda. The Hussite doctrine of tithes\r\nappears hereafter in most of the peasant programmes.\r\n\r\nA still more powerful impulse to revolts was given by the tragic fate of\r\nCharles the Bold of Burgundy. Charles was the ideal feudal autocrat. He\r\nwas looked up to and imitated by the feudal princes of Germany in the\r\nfifteenth as was Louis XIV. by their descendants in the end of the\r\nseventeenth century. The common people regarded him as the typical feudal\r\ntyrant, and the hateful impression which his arrogance, his\r\nvindictiveness, and his oppression of the poor made upon them comes out in\r\nthe folk-songs of the period:\r\n\r\n\r\n    “Er schazt sich künig Alexander gleich;\r\n    Er wolt bezwingen alle Reich,\r\n    Das wante Got in kurzer stund.”\r\n\r\n\r\nHe even came to be considered by them as one of the Antichrists who were\r\nto appear, and for years after his death at Nancy (1477) many believed\r\nthat he was alive, expiating his sins on a prolonged pilgrimage.\r\n\r\nWhen this great potentate, who was believed to have boasted that there\r\nwere three rulers—God in heaven, Lucifer in hell, and himself on earth—was\r\ndefeated at Granson, routed at Morat, routed and slain at Nancy, and that\r\nby Swiss peasants, the exultation was immense, and it was believed that\r\nthe peasantry might inherit the earth.(59)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 6. The religious Socialism of Hans Böhm.\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring the last years of this memorable Burgundian war a strange movement\r\narose in the very centre of Germany, within the district which may be\r\nroughly defined as the triangle whose points were the towns of\r\nAschaffenburg, Würzburg, and Crailsheim, in the secluded valleys of the\r\nSpessart and the Taubergrund. A young man, Hans Böhm (Böheim, Böhaim),\r\nbelonging to the very lowest class of society, below the peasant, who\r\nwandered from one country festival or church ale to another, and played on\r\nthe small drum or on the dudelsack (rude bagpipes), or sang songs for the\r\ndancers, was suddenly awakened to a sense of spiritual things by the\r\ndiscourse of a wandering Franciscan. He was utterly uneducated. He did not\r\neven know the Creed. He had visions of the Blessed Virgin, who appeared to\r\nhim in the guise of a lady dressed in white, called him to be a preacher,\r\nand promised him further revelations, which he received from time to time.\r\nHis home was the village of Helmstadt in the Tauber valley; and the most\r\nsacred spot he knew was a chapel dedicated to the Virgin at the small\r\nvillage of Niklashausen on the Tauber. The chapel had been granted an\r\nindulgence, and was the scene of small pilgrimages. Hans Böhm appeared\r\nsuddenly on the Sunday in Mid-Lent (March 24th, 1476), solemnly burnt his\r\nrude drum and bagpipes before the crowd of people, and declared that he\r\nhad hitherto ministered to the sins and vanities of the villagers, but\r\nthat henceforth he was going to be a preacher of grace. He had been a lad\r\nof blameless life, and his character gave force to his words. He related\r\nhis visions, and the people believed him. It was a period when an epidemic\r\nof pilgrimage was sweeping over Europe, and the pilgrims spread the news\r\nof the prophet far and wide. Crowds came to hear him from the neighbouring\r\nvalleys. His fame spread to more distant parts, and chroniclers declare\r\nthat on some days he preached to audiences of from twenty to thirty\r\nthousand persons. His pulpit was a barrel set on end, or the window of a\r\nfarmhouse, or the branch of a tree. He assured his hearers that the\r\nholiest spot on earth, holier by far than Rome, was the chapel of Our Lady\r\nat Niklashausen, and that true religion consisted in doing honour to the\r\nBlessed Virgin. He denounced all priests in unmeasured terms: they were\r\nworse than Jews; they might be converted for a while, but as soon as they\r\nwent back among their fellows they were sure to become backsliders. He\r\nrailed against the Emperor: he was a miscreant, who supported the whole\r\nvile crew of princes, over-lords, tax-gatherers, and other oppressors of\r\nthe poor. He scoffed at the Pope. He denied the existence of Purgatory:\r\ngood men went directly to heaven and bad men went to hell. The day was\r\ncoming, he declared, when every prince, even the Emperor himself, must\r\nwork for his day’s wages like all poor people. He asserted that taxes of\r\nall kinds were evil, and should not be paid; that fish, game, and meadow\r\nlands were common property; that all men were brethren, and should share\r\nalike. When his sermon was finished the crowd of devotees knelt round the\r\n“holy youth,” and he, blessing them, pardoned their sins in God’s name.\r\nThen the crowd surged round him, tearing at his clothes to get some scrap\r\nof cloth to take home and worship as a relic; and the Niklashausen chapel\r\nbecame rich with the offerings of the thousands of pilgrims.\r\n\r\nThe authorities, lay and clerical, paid little attention to him at first.\r\nSome princes and some cities (Nürnberg, for example) prohibited their\r\nsubjects from going to Niklashausen; but the prophet was left untouched.\r\nHe came to believe that his words ought to be translated into actions. One\r\nSunday he asked his followers to meet him on the next Sunday, bringing\r\ntheir swords and leaving their wives and children at home. The Bishop of\r\nWürzburg, hearing this, sent a troop of thirty-four horsemen, who seized\r\nthe prophet, flung him on a horse, and carried him away to the bishop’s\r\nfortress of Frauenberg near Würzburg. His followers had permitted his\r\ncapture, and seemed dazed by it. In a day or two they recovered their\r\ncourage, and, exhorted by an old peasant who had received a vision, and\r\nheaded by four Franconian knights, they marched against Frauenberg and\r\nsurrounded it. They expected its walls to fall like those of Jericho; and\r\nwhen they were disappointed they lingered for some days, and then\r\ngradually dispersed. Hans himself, after examination, was condemned to be\r\nburnt as a heretic. He died singing a folk-hymn in praise of the Blessed\r\nVirgin.\r\n\r\nHis death did not end the faith of his followers. In spite of severe\r\nprohibitions, the pilgrimages went on and the gifts accumulated. A\r\nneighbouring knight sacked the chapel and carried away the treasure, which\r\nhe was forced to share with his neighbours. Still the pilgrimages\r\ncontinued, until at last the ecclesiastical authorities removed the priest\r\nand tore down the building, hoping thereby to destroy the movement.\r\n\r\nThe memory of Hans Böhm lived among the common people, peasants and\r\nartisans; for the lower classes of Würzburg and the neighbouring towns had\r\nbeen followers of the movement. A religious social movement, purely\r\nGerman, had come into being, and was not destined to die soon. The effects\r\nof Hans Böhm’s teaching appear in almost all subsequent peasant and\r\nartisan revolts.(60) Even Sebastian Brand takes the Niklashausen pilgrims\r\nas his type of those enthusiasts who are not contented with the\r\nrevelations of the Old and New Testaments, but must seek a special prophet\r\nof their own:\r\n\r\n\r\n    “Man weis doch aus der Schrift so viel,\r\n    Aus altem und aus neuem Bunde,\r\n    Es braucht nicht wieder neuer Kunde.\r\n    Dennoch wallfahrten sie zur Klausen\r\n    Des Sackpfeifers von Nicklashausen.”(61)\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd the Niklashausen pilgrimage was preserved in the memories of the\r\npeople by a lengthy folk-song which Liliencron has printed in his\r\ncollection.(62)\r\n\r\nFrom this time onwards there was always some tinge of religious enthusiasm\r\nin the social revolts, where peasant and poor burghers stood shoulder to\r\nshoulder against the ruling powers in country and in town.\r\n\r\nThe peasants within the lands of the Abbot of Kempten, north-east of the\r\nLake of Constance, had for two generations protested against the way in\r\nwhich the authorities were treating them (1420-1490). They rose in open\r\nrevolt in 1491-1492. It was a purely agrarian rising to begin with, caused\r\nby demands made on them by their over-lord not sanctioned by the old\r\ncustoms expressed in the _Weisthümer_; but the lower classes of the town\r\nof Kempten made common cause with the insurgents. Yet there are distinct\r\ntraces of impregnation with religious enthusiasm not unlike that which\r\ninspired the Hans Böhm movement. The rising was crushed, and the leaders\r\nwho escaped took refuge in Switzerland.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 7. Bundschuh Revolts.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the widespread social revolt which broke out in Elsass in 1493, the\r\npeasants were supported by the towns; demands were made for the abolition\r\nof the imperial and the ecclesiastical courts of justice, for the\r\nreduction of ecclesiastical property, for the plundering of Jews who had\r\nbeen fattening upon usury, and for the curbing of the power of the\r\npriests. The Germans had a proverb, “The poor man must tie his shoes with\r\nstring,” and the “tied shoe” (_Bundschuh_), the poor man’s shoe, became\r\nthe emblem of this and subsequent social revolts, while their motto was,\r\n“Only what is just before God.” This rebellion, which was prematurely\r\nbetrayed, did not lack prominent leaders. One of them was Hans Ulman, the\r\nburgomeister of Schlettstadt, who died on the scaffold affirming the\r\njustice of the demands which he and his companions had made, and\r\npredicting their future triumph.\r\n\r\nIn 1501 the peasants of Kempten and the neighbouring districts again rose\r\nin rebellion, and were again joined by the poorer townspeople. In the year\r\nfollowing, 1502, a revolt was planned having for its headquarters the\r\nvillage of Untergrombach, near Speyer; it spread into Elsass, along the\r\nNeckar and down the Rhine. The _Bundschuh_ banner was again unfurled. It\r\nwas made of blue silk, with a white cross, the emblem of Switzerland, in\r\nthe centre. It was adorned with a picture of the crucified Christ, a\r\n_Bundschuh_ on the one side, and a kneeling peasant on the other. The\r\nmotto was again, “Only what is just before God.” Every associate promised\r\nto repeat five times a day the Lord’s Prayer and the _Ave Maria_. The\r\npatron saints were declared to be the Blessed Virgin and St. John. The\r\nmovement was strongly anti-clerical. The leaders taught that there could\r\nbe no deliverance from oppression until the priests were driven from the\r\nland, and until the property of the nobles and the priests was confiscated\r\nand their power broken. Tithes, feudal exactions of all kinds, and all\r\nsocial inequalities were denounced; water, forest and pasture lands were\r\ndeclared to be the common property of all. The leaders recognised the rule\r\nof the Emperor as over-lord, but denounced all intermediate jurisdictions.\r\nThe plan was to raise the peasants and the townspeople throughout all\r\nGermany, and to call upon the Swiss to aid them in winning their\r\ndeliverance from oppression. The revolt was put down with savage cruelty;\r\nmost of the leaders were quartered. Many escaped to Switzerland, and lay\r\nhid among the Alpine valleys.\r\n\r\nOne of these was Joss Fritz, who had been a soldier (_landsknecht_)—a man\r\nwith many qualities of leadership. He had tenacity of purpose, great\r\npowers of organisation, and gifts of persuasion. He vowed to restore the\r\n_Bundschuh_ League. He remained years in hiding in Switzerland, maturing\r\nhis plans. Then he returned secretly to his own people. He seems to have\r\nsecured an appointment as forester to a nobleman whose lands lay near the\r\ntown of Freiburg in the Breisgau; and there, in the small village of\r\nLehen, he began to weave together again the broken threads of the\r\n_Bundschuh_ League. He mingled with the poorer people in the taverns, at\r\nchurch ales, on the village greens on festival days. He spoke of the\r\njustice of God and the wickedness of the world. He expounded the old\r\nprinciples of the _Bundschuh_ with some few variations. Indiscriminate\r\nhatred of priests seems to have been abandoned. Most of the village\r\npriests were peasants, and suffered, like them, from overbearing\r\nsuperiors. The parish priest of Lehen became a strong supporter of the\r\n_Bundschuh_, and told his parishioners that all its ideas could be proved\r\nfrom the word of God. Joss Fritz won over to his side the “gilds” of\r\nbeggars, strolling musicians, all kinds of vagrants who could be useful.\r\nThey carried his messages, summoned the people to his meetings in quiet\r\nspaces in the woods, and were active assistants. At these meetings Joss\r\nFritz and his lieutenant Jerome, a journeyman baker, expounded the\r\nScriptures “under the guidance of the Holy Spirit simply,” and proved all\r\nthe demands of the _Bundschuh_ from the word of God.\r\n\r\nWhen the country seemed almost ripe for the rising, Joss Fritz resolved to\r\nprepare the banner as secretly as possible. It was easy to get the blue\r\nsilk and sew the white cross on its ground; the difficulty was to find an\r\nartist sympathetic enough to paint the emblems, and courageous enough to\r\nkeep the secret. The banner was at last painted. The crucified Christ in\r\nthe centre, a peasant kneeling in prayer on the one side and the\r\n_Bundschuh_ on the other, the figures of the Virgin Mary and St. John, and\r\nthe pictures of the Pope and the Emperor. The motto, “O Lord, help the\r\nrighteous,” was added, and the banner with its striking symbolism was\r\ncomplete. The League had the old programme with some alterations:—no\r\nmasters but God, the Pope, and the Emperor, no usury, all debts to be\r\ncancelled, and the clauses mentioned above. The leaders boasted that their\r\nleague extended as far as the city of Köln (Cologne), and that the Swiss\r\nwould march at their head. But the secret leaked out before the date\r\nplanned for the general rising; and the revolt was mercilessly stamped out\r\n(1512-1513). Its leader escaped with the _Bundschuh_ banner wound round\r\nhis body under his clothes. In four years he was back again at his work\r\n(1517). In a very short time his agents, the “gild” of beggars, wandering\r\nminstrels, poor priests, pilgrims to local shrines, pardon-sellers,\r\nbegging friars, and even lepers, had leagued the peasantry and the poorer\r\nartisans in the towns in one vast conspiracy which permeated the entire\r\ndistrict between the Vosges and the Black Forest, including the whole of\r\nBaden and Elsass. The plot was again betrayed before the plans of the\r\nleaders were matured, and the partial risings were easily put down; but\r\nwhen the authorities set themselves to make careful investigations, they\r\nwere aghast at the extent of the movement. The peasants of the country\r\ndistricts and the populace of the towns had been bound together to avenge\r\ncommon wrongs. The means of secret communication had been furnished by\r\ncountry innkeepers, old _landsknechts_, pedlars, parish priests, as well\r\nas by the vagrants above mentioned; and the names of some of the\r\nsubordinate leaders—“long” John, “crooked” Peter, “old” Kuntz—show the\r\nclasses from which they were drawn. It was discovered that the populace of\r\nWeisenburg had come to an agreement with the people of Hagenau (both towns\r\nwere in Elsass) to slay the civic councillors and judges and all the\r\ninhabitants of noble descent, to refuse payment of all imperial and\r\necclesiastical dues, and that the Swiss had promised to come to their\r\nassistance.\r\n\r\nOne might almost say that between the years 1503 and 1517 the social\r\nrevolution was permanently established in the southern districts of the\r\nEmpire, from Elsass in the west to Carinthia and the Steiermarck in the\r\neast. It is needless to describe the risings in detail. They were not\r\npurely peasant rebellions, for the townspeople were almost always\r\ninvolved; but they all displayed that mingling of communist ideas and\r\nreligious enthusiasm of which the _Bundschuh_ banner had become the\r\nemblem, and which may be traced back to the movement under Hans Böhm as\r\nits German source, and perhaps to the earlier propaganda of the Hussite\r\nrevolutionaries or Taborites. The later decades of the fifteenth and the\r\nearlier years of the sixteenth century were a time of permanent social\r\nunrest.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 8. The Causes of the continuous Revolts.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf we ask why it was that the peasants, whose lot, according to the\r\ninformation given in the _Weisthümer_, could not have been such a very\r\nhard one, were so ready to rise in rebellion during the last quarter of\r\nthe fifteenth century, the answer seems to be that there must have been a\r\ngrowing change in their circumstances. Some chroniclers have described the\r\ncondition of the peasants in the end of the fifteenth and in the beginning\r\nof the sixteenth century, and they always dwell upon their misery. John\r\nBöhm, who wrote in the beginning of the sixteenth century, says that\r\n“their lot was hard and pitiable,” and calls them “slaves.”(63) Sebastian\r\nFrank (1534), Sebastian Munster (1546), H. Pantaleone (1570), an Italian\r\nwho wrote a description of Germany, all agree with Böhm. Frank adds that\r\nthe peasants hate every kind of cleric, good or bad, and that their speech\r\nis full of gibes against priests and monks; while Pantaleone observes that\r\nmany skilled workmen, artisans, artists, and men of learning have sprung\r\nfrom this despised peasant class. There must have been a great change for\r\nthe worse in the condition of the poorer dwellers both in town and in\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nSo far as the townsmen are concerned, nothing need be added to what has\r\nalready been said; but the causes of the growing depression of the\r\npeasantry were more complicated. The universal testimony of contemporaries\r\nis that the gradual introduction of Roman law brought the greatest change,\r\nby placing a means of universal oppression in the hands of the over-lords.\r\nThere is no need to suppose that the lawyers who introduced the new\r\njurisprudence meant to use it to degrade and oppress the peasant class. A\r\nslight study of the _Weisthümer_ shows how complicated and varied was this\r\nconsuetudinary law which regulated the relations between peasant and\r\nover-lord. It was natural, when great estates grew to be principalities,\r\nwhether lay or clerical, that the over-lords should seek for some\r\nprinciple of codification or reduction to uniformity. It had been the\r\ncustom for centuries to attempt to simplify the ruder and involved German\r\ncodes by bringing them into harmony with the principles of Roman law, and\r\nthis idea had received a powerful impetus from the Renaissance movement.\r\nBut when the bewildering multiplicity of customary usages which had\r\ngoverned the relations of cultivators to over-lords was simplified\r\naccording to the ideas of Roman law, the result was in the highest degree\r\ndangerous to the free peasantry of Germany. The conception of strict\r\nindividual proprietorship tended to displace the indefinite conception of\r\ncommunal proprietorship, and the peasants could only appear in the guise\r\nof tenants on long leases, or serfs who might have some personal rights\r\nbut no rights of property, or slaves who had no rights at all. The new\r\njurisprudence began by attacking the common lands, pastures, and forests.\r\nThe passion for the chase, which became the more engrossing as the right\r\nto wage private war grew more and more dangerous, led to the nobles\r\ninsisting on the individual title to all forest lands, and to the\r\npublication of such forest laws as we find made in Würtemberg, where\r\nanyone found trespassing with gun or cross-bow was liable to lose one eye.\r\nThe attempt to reduce a free peasantry in possession of communal property\r\nto tenants on long lease, then to serfs, and, lastly, to slaves, may be\r\nseen in the seventy years’ struggle between the Abbots of Kempten and\r\ntheir peasants. These spiritual lords carried on the contest with every\r\nkind of force and chicanery they could command. They enlarged illegally\r\nthe jurisdiction of their spiritual courts; they prevented the poor people\r\nwho opposed them from coming to the Lord’s Table; they actually falsified\r\ntheir title-deeds, inserting provisions which were not originally\r\ncontained in them.\r\n\r\nThe case of the Kempten lands was, no doubt, an extreme one, though it\r\ncould be matched by others. But the point to be noticed is the immense\r\nopportunities for oppression which were placed in the hands of the\r\nover-lords by the new jurisprudence, and the temptation to make use of\r\nthem when their interests seemed to require it, or when their peasantry\r\nbegan to grow refractory or became too prosperous. The economic changes\r\nwhich were at work throughout the fifteenth century gave occasion for the\r\nuse of the powers which the new jurisdiction had placed at the disposal of\r\nlandlords. The economic revolution from the first impoverished the nobles\r\nof Germany; while, in its beginnings and until after the great rise in\r\nprices, it rather helped the peasantry. They had a better market for their\r\nproduce, and they so profited by it that the burghers spoke of denying\r\nthem the right of free markets, on the ground that they had begun to usurp\r\nthe place of the merchants and were trafficking in gold by lending money\r\non interest. The competition in luxurious dress and living, which the\r\nimpoverished nobles carried on with the rich burghers, made the former\r\nstill poorer and more reckless. We read of a noble lady in Swabia who,\r\nrather than be outshone at a tournament, sold a village and all her rights\r\nover it in order to buy a blue velvet dress. The nobles, becoming poorer\r\nand poorer, saw their own peasants making money to such an extent that\r\nthey were, comparatively speaking, much better off than themselves, so\r\nthat in Westphalia it was said that a peasant could get credit more easily\r\nthan five nobles.\r\n\r\nMoreover, the peasants did not appear to be as submissive to their lords\r\nas they once had been. Nor was it to be wondered at. The creation of the\r\n_landsknechts_ had put new thoughts into their heads. The days of the old\r\nfighting chivalry were over, and the strength of armies was measured by\r\nthe number and discipline of the infantry. The victories of the Swiss over\r\nCharles the Bold had made the peasant or artisan soldier a power. Kings\r\nand princes raised standing armies, recruited from the country districts\r\nor from among the wilder and more restless of the town population. The\r\nfolk-songs are full of the doings of these plebeian soldiers. When the\r\n_landsknecht_ visited his relations in village or in town, swaggered about\r\nin his gorgeous parti-coloured clothes, his broad hat adorned with huge\r\nfeathers, his great gauntlets and his weapons; when he showed a gold chain\r\nor his ducats, or a jewel he had won as his share of the booty; when his\r\nold neighbours saw his dress and gait imitated by the young burghers,—he\r\nbecame a centre of admiration, and his relations began to hold themselves\r\nhigh on his account. They acquired a new independence of character, a new\r\nimpatience against all that prevented them from rising in the world. It\r\nhas scarcely been sufficiently noted how most of the leaders in the\r\nplebeian risings were disbanded _landsknechts_.(64)\r\n\r\nThe new jurisprudence was a very effectual instrument in the hands of an\r\nimpoverished landlord class to ease the peasant of his superfluous wealth,\r\nand to keep him in his proper place. It was used almost universally, and\r\nthe peasant rebellions were the natural consequences. But the more\r\ndetermined peasant revolts, which began with the _Bundschuh_ League, arose\r\nat a time when life was hard for peasant and artisan alike.\r\n\r\nThe last decade of the fifteenth century and the first of the sixteenth\r\ncontained a number of years in which the harvest failed almost entirely\r\nover all or in parts of Germany. They began with 1490, and in that year\r\ncontemporary writers, like Trithemius, declare that the lot of the poor\r\nwas almost unbearable. The bad harvests of 1491 and 1492 made things\r\nworse. In 1493, the year which saw the foundation of the _Bundschuh_, the\r\nstate of matters may be guessed from the fact that men came all the way\r\nfrom the Tyrol to the upper reaches of the Main, where the harvest was\r\ncomparatively good, bought barley there for five times its usual price,\r\ncarried it on pack-horses by little frequented paths to their own country,\r\nand sold it at a profit.\r\n\r\nIn 1499 the Swiss refused to submit to the imperial proposals for\r\nconsolidating the Empire. Maximilian or his government in the Tyrol\r\nresolved to punish them, and the Swabian League were to be the\r\nexecutioners. The Swiss, highly incensed, had declared that if they were\r\nforced into war it would be a war of extermination. They were as bad as\r\ntheir word. An eye-witness saw whole villages in the wasted districts\r\nforsaken by the men, and the women gathered in troops, feeding on herbs\r\nand roots, and seeing with the apathy of despair their ranks diminish clay\r\nby day.(65) The Swiss war was worse than many bad harvests for the Hegau\r\nand other districts in South Germany.\r\n\r\nIn 1500 the harvest failed over all Germany; 1501 and 1502 were years when\r\nthe crops failed in a number of districts; and in 1503 there was another\r\nuniversally bad harvest. These years of scarcity pressed most heavily on\r\nthe peasant class. In some districts of Brandenburg, peasants were found\r\nin the woods dead of starvation, with the grass which they had been trying\r\nto eat still in their mouths. Cities like Augsburg and Strassburg bought\r\ngrain, stored it in magazines, and kept the poor alive by periodical\r\ndistributions. This cycle of famine years from 1490 to 1503 was the period\r\nwhen the most determined and desperate social risings took place, and\r\nlargely explains them.(66)\r\n\r\nOur description of the social conditions existing during the period which\r\nushered in the Reformation has been confined to Germany. The great\r\nreligious movement took its origin in that land, and it is of the utmost\r\nimportance to study the environment there. But the universal economic\r\nchanges were producing social disturbances everywhere, modified in\r\nappearance and character by the special conditions of the various\r\ncountries of Europe. The popular risings in England, which began with the\r\ngigantic labour strike under Wat Tyler and priest Ball, and ended with the\r\ndisturbances during the reign of Edward VI., were the counterpart of the\r\nsocial revolt in Germany.\r\n\r\nFrom all that has been said, it will be evident that on the eve of the\r\nReformation the condition of Europe, and of Germany in particular, was one\r\nof seething discontent and full of bitter class hatreds,—the trading\r\ncompanies and the great capitalists against the “gilds,” the poorer\r\nclasses against the wealthier, and the nobles against the towns. This\r\nstate of things is abundantly reflected in the folk-songs of the period,\r\nwhich best reveal the intimate feelings of the people. For it was an age\r\nof song everywhere, and especially in Germany. Nobles and knights,\r\nburghers and peasants, _landsknechts_ and Swiss soldiers, priests and\r\nclerks, lawyers and merchants—all expressed the feelings of their class\r\nwhen they sang; and the folk-songs give us a wonderful picture of the\r\nclass hatreds which were rending asunder the old conditions of mediæval\r\nlife, and preparing the way for a new world.\r\n\r\nThis social ferment was increased by a sudden and mysterious rise in\r\nprices, affecting first the articles of foreign produce, to which the\r\nwealthier classes had become greatly addicted, and at last the ordinary\r\nnecessaries of life. The cause, it is now believed, was not the debasing\r\nof the coinage, for that affected a narrow circle only; nor was it the\r\nimportation of precious metals from America, for that came later; it was\r\nrather the increased output of the mines in Europe. Whatever the cause,\r\nthe thing was to contemporaries an irritating mystery, and each class in\r\nsociety was disposed to blame the others for it. We have thus at the\r\nbeginning of the sixteenth century a restless social condition in Germany,\r\ncaused in great measure by economic causes which no one understood, but\r\nwhose results were painfully manifest in the crowds of sturdy beggars who\r\nthronged the roads—the refuse of all classes in society, from the broken\r\nnoble and the disbanded mercenary soldier to the ruined peasant, the\r\nworkman out of employment, the begging friar, and the “wandering student.”\r\nIt was into this mass of seething discontent that the spark of religious\r\nprotest fell—the one thing needed to fire the train and kindle the social\r\nconflagration. This was the society to which Luther spoke, and its\r\ndiscontent was the sounding-board which made his words reverberate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter V. Family And Popular Religious Life in the Decades Before the\r\nReformation.(67)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 1. Devotion of Germany to the Roman Church.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe real roots of the spiritual life of Luther and of the other Reformers\r\nought to be sought for in the family and in the popular religious life of\r\nthe times. It is the duty of the historian to discover, if possible, what\r\nreligious instruction was given by parents to children in the pious homes\r\nout of which most of the Reformers came, and what religious influences\r\nconfronted and surrounded pious lads after they had left the family\r\ncircle. Few have cared to prosecute the difficult task; and it is only\r\nwithin late years that the requisite material has been accumulated. It has\r\nto be sought for in autobiographies, diaries, and private letters; in the\r\nbooks of popular devotion which the patience of ecclesiastical\r\narchæologists is exhuming and reprinting; in the references to the pious\r\nconfraternities of the later Middle Ages, and more especially to the\r\n_Kalands_ among the artisans, which appear in town chronicles, and whose\r\nconstitutions are being slowly unearthed by local historical societies; in\r\nthe police regulations of towns and country districts which aim at curbing\r\nthe power of the clergy, and in the edicts of princes attempting to\r\nenforce some of the recommendations of the Councils of Constance and\r\nBasel; in the more popular hymns of the time, and in the sermons of the\r\nmore fervent preachers; in the pilgrim songs and the pilgrim guide-books;\r\nand in a variety of other sources not commonly studied by Church\r\nhistorians.\r\n\r\nOn the surface no land seemed more devoted to the mediæval Church and to\r\nthe Pope, its head, than did Germany in the half century before the\r\nReformation. A cultivated Italian, Aleander, papal nuncio at the Diet of\r\nWorms, was astonished at the signs of disaffection he met with in\r\n1520.(68) He had visited Germany frequently, and he was intimately\r\nacquainted with many of the northern Humanists; and his opinion was that\r\ndown to 1510 (the date of his last visit) he had never been among a people\r\nso devoted to the Bishop of Rome. No nation had exhibited such signs of\r\ndelight at the ending of the Schism and the re-establishment of the “Peace\r\nof the Church.” The Italian Humanists continually express their wonder at\r\nthe strength of the religious susceptibilities of the Germans; and the\r\npapal Curia looked upon German devotion as a never-failing source of Roman\r\nrevenue. The Germans displayed an almost feverish anxiety to profit by all\r\nthe ordinary and extraordinary means of grace. They built innumerable\r\nchurches; their towns were full of conventual foundations; they bought\r\nIndulgences, went on pilgrimages, visited shrines, reverenced relics in a\r\nway that no other nation did. The piety of the Germans was proverbial.\r\n\r\nThe number of churches was enormous for the population. Almost every tiny\r\nvillage had its chapel, and every town of any size had several churches.\r\nChurch building and decoration was a feature of the age. In the town of\r\nDantzig 8 new churches had been founded or completed during the fifteenth\r\ncentury. The “holy” city of Köln (Cologne) at the close of the fifteenth\r\ncentury contained 11 great churches, 19 parish churches, 22 monasteries,\r\n12 hospitals, and 76 convents; more than a thousand Masses were said at\r\nits altars every day. It was exceptionally rich in ecclesiastical\r\nbuildings, no doubt; but the smaller town of Brunswick had 15 churches,\r\nover 20 chapels, 5 monasteries, 6 hospitals, and 12 Beguine-houses, and\r\nits great church, dedicated to St. Blasius, had 26 altars served by 60\r\necclesiastics. So it was all over Germany.\r\n\r\nBesides the large numbers of monks and nuns who peopled the innumerable\r\nmonasteries and convents, a large part of the population belonged to some\r\nsemi-ecclesiastical association. Many were tertiaries of St. Francis; many\r\nwere connected with the Beguines: Köln (Cologne) had 106 Beguine-houses;\r\nStrassburg, over 60, and Basel, over 30.\r\n\r\nThe churches and chapels, monasteries and religious houses, received all\r\nkinds of offerings from rich and poor alike. In those days of unexampled\r\nburgher prosperity and wealth, the town churches became “museums and\r\ntreasure-houses.” The windows were filled with painted glass; weapons,\r\narmour, jewels, pictures, tapestries were stored in the treasuries or\r\nadorned the walls. Ancient inventories have been preserved of some of\r\nthese ecclesiastical accumulations of wealth. In the cathedral church in\r\nBern, to take one example, the head of St. Vincentius, the patron, was\r\nadorned with a great quantity of gold, and with one jewel said to be\r\npriceless; the treasury contained 70 gold and 50 silver cups, 2 silver\r\ncoffers, and 450 costly sacramental robes decked with jewels of great\r\nvalue. The luxury, the artistic fancy, and the wealth which could minister\r\nto both, all three were characteristic of the times, were lavished by the\r\nGermans on their churches.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 2. Preaching.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, preaching took a place it had never previously held in\r\nthe mediæval Church. Some distinguished Churchmen did not hesitate to say\r\nthat it was the most important duty the priest could perform—more\r\nimportant than saying Mass. It was recognised that when the people began\r\nto read the Bible and religious books in the vernacular, it became\r\nnecessary for the priests to be able to instruct their congregations\r\nintelligently and sympathetically in sermons. Attempts were made to\r\nprovide the preachers with material for their sermon-making. The earliest\r\nwas the _Biblia Pauperum_ (the Bible for the _Pauperes Christi_, or the\r\npreaching monks), which collects on one page pictures of Bible histories\r\nfitted to explain each other, and adds short comments. Thus, on the\r\ntwenty-fifth leaf there are three pictures—in the centre the Crucifixion;\r\non the left Abraham about to slay Isaac, with the lamb in the foreground;\r\nand on the left the Brazen Serpent and the healing of the Plague. More\r\nscholarly preachers found a valuable commentary in the _Postilla_ of the\r\nlearned Franciscan Nicolas de Lyra (Lira or Lire, a village in Normandy),\r\nwho was the first real exegetical scholar, and to whom Luther was in later\r\ndays greatly indebted.(69)\r\n\r\nManuals of Pastoral Theology were also written and published for the\r\nbenefit of the parish priests,—the most famous, under the quaint title,\r\n_Dormi Secure_ (sleep in safety). It describes the more important portions\r\nof the service, and what makes a good sermon; it gives the Lessons for the\r\nSunday services, the chief articles of the Christian faith, find adds\r\ndirections for pastoral work and the cure of souls. It is somewhat\r\ndifficult to describe briefly the character of the preaching. Some of it\r\nwas very edifying and deservedly popular. The sermons of John Herolt were\r\nprinted, and attained a very wide circulation. No fewer than forty-one\r\neditions appeared. Much of the preaching was the exposition of themes\r\ntaken from the Scholastic Theology treated in the most technical way. Many\r\nof the preachers seem to have profaned their office in the search after\r\npopularity, and mingled very questionable stories and coarse jokes with\r\ntheir exhortations. The best known of the preachers who flourished at the\r\nclose of the fifteenth century was John Geiler of Keysersberg (in Elsass\r\nnear Colmar), the friend of Sebastian Brand, and a member of the Humanist\r\ncircle of Strassburg. The position he filled illustrates the eagerness of\r\nmen of the time to encourage preaching. A burgher of Strassburg, Peter\r\nSchott, left a sum of money to endow a preacher, who was to be a doctor of\r\ntheology, one who had not taken monk’s vows, and who was to preach to the\r\npeople in the vernacular; a special pulpit was erected in the Strassburg\r\nMinster for the preacher provided by this foundation, who was John Geiler.\r\nHis sermons are full of exhortations to piety and correct living. He\r\nlashed the vices and superstitions of his time. He denounced relic\r\nworship, pilgrimages, buying indulgences, and the corruptions in the\r\nmonasteries and convents. He spoke against the luxurious living of Popes\r\nand prelates, and their trafficking in the sale of benefices. He made\r\nsarcastic references to the papal decretals and to the quibblings of\r\nScholastic Theology. He paints the luxuries and vices he denounced so very\r\nclearly, that his writings are a valuable mine for the historian of\r\npopular morals. He was a stern preacher of morals, but his sermons contain\r\nvery little of the gospel message. As we read them we can understand\r\nLuther’s complaint, that while he had listened to many a sermon on the\r\nsins of the age, and to many a discourse expounding scholastic themes, he\r\nhad never heard one which declared the love of God to man in the mission\r\nand work of Jesus Christ.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 3. Church Festivals.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Church itself, recognising the fondness of the people for all kinds of\r\nscenic display, delighted to gratify the prevailing taste by magnificent\r\nprocessions, by gorgeous church ceremonial, by Passion and Miracle Plays.\r\nSuch scenes are continually described in contemporary chronicles. The\r\nprocessions were arranged for Corpus Christi Day, for Christmas, for\r\nHarvest Thanksgivings, when the civic fathers requested the clergy to pray\r\nfor rain, or when a great papal official visited the town. We hear of one\r\nat Erfurt which began at five o’clock in the morning, and, with its visits\r\nto the stations of the Cross and the services at each, did not end till\r\nnoon. The school children of the town, numbering 948, headed the\r\nprocession, then came 312 priests, then the whole University,—in all, 2141\r\npersons,—and the monks belonging to the five monasteries followed. The\r\nHoly Sacrament carried by the chief ecclesiastics, and preceded by a large\r\nnumber of gigantic candles, occupied the middle of the procession. The\r\ntown council followed, then all the townsmen, then the women and maidens.\r\nThe troop of maidens was 2316 strong. They had garlands on their heads,\r\nand their hair flowed down over their shoulders; they carried lighted\r\ncandles in their hands, and they marched modestly looking to the ground.\r\nTwo beautiful girls walked at their head with banners, followed by four\r\nwith lanterns. In the centre was the fairest, clad in black and barefoot,\r\ncarrying a large and splendid cross, and by her side one of the town\r\ncouncillors chosen for his good looks. Everything was arranged with a view\r\nto artistic effect.(70)\r\n\r\nThe Passion and Miracle Plays(71) were of great use in instructing the\r\npeople in the contents of Scripture, being almost always composed of\r\nbiblical scenes and histories. They were often very elaborate; sometimes\r\nmore than one hundred actors were needed to fill the parts; and the plays\r\nwere frequently so lengthy that they lasted for two or three days. The\r\necclesiastical managers felt that the continuous presentation of grave and\r\nlofty scenes and sentiments might weary their audiences, and they mixed\r\nthem with lighter ones, which frequently degenerated into buffoonery and\r\nworse. The sacred and severe pathos of the Passion was interlarded with\r\ncoarse jokes about the devil; and the most solemn conceptions were\r\nprofaned. These Mysteries were generally performed in the great churches,\r\nand the buildings dedicated to sacred things witnessed scenes of the\r\ncoarsest humour, to the detriment of all religious feeling. The more\r\nserious Churchmen felt the profanation, and tried to prohibit the\r\nperformance of plays interlarded with rude and indecent scenes within the\r\nchurches and churchyards. Their interference came too late; the rough\r\npopular taste demanded what it had been accustomed to; sacred histories\r\nand customs coming down from a primitive heathenism were mixed together,\r\nand the people lost the sense of sacredness which ought to attach itself\r\nto the former. The Feast of the Ass, to mention one, was supposed to\r\ncommemorate the Flight to Egypt. A beautiful girl, holding a child in her\r\nlap, was seated on an ass decked with splendid trappings of gold cloth,\r\nand was led in procession by the clergy through the principal streets of\r\nthe town to the parish church. The girl on her ass was conducted into the\r\nchurch and placed near the high altar, and the Mass and other services\r\nwere each concluded by the whole congregation braying. There is indeed an\r\nold MS. extant with a rubric which orders the priest to bray thrice on\r\nelevating the Host.(72) At other seasons of popular licence, all the parts\r\nof the church service, even the most solemn, were parodied by the profane\r\nyouth of the towns.(73)\r\n\r\nAll this, however, tells us little about the intimate religious life and\r\nfeelings of the people, which is the important matter for the study of the\r\nroots of the great ecclesiastical revolt.\r\n\r\nWhen the evidence collected from the sources is sifted, it will be found\r\nthat the religious life of the people at the close of the fifteenth and\r\nbeginning of the sixteenth centuries is full of discordant elements, and\r\nmakes what must appear to us a very incongruous mosaic. If classification\r\nbe permissible, which it scarcely is (for religious types always refuse to\r\nbe kept distinct, and always tend to run into each other), one would be\r\ndisposed to speak of the simple homely piety of the family circle—the\r\nreligion taught at the mother’s knee, the _Kinderlehre_, as Luther called\r\nit; of a certain flamboyant religion which inspired the crowds; of a calm\r\nanti-clerical religion which grew and spread silently throughout Germany;\r\nof the piety of the praying-circles, the descendants of the fourteenth\r\ncentury Mystics.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 4. The Family Religious Life.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe biographies of some of the leaders of the Reformation, when they\r\nrelate the childish reminiscences of the writers, bear unconscious witness\r\nto the kind of religion which was taught to the children in pious burgher\r\nand peasant families. We know that Luther learned the Creed, the Ten\r\nCommandments, and the Lord’s Prayer. He knew such simple evangelical hymns\r\nas “Ein kindelein so lobelich,”(74) “Nun bitten wir den heiligen Geist,”\r\nand “Crist ist erstanden.” Children were rocked to sleep while the mothers\r\nsang:\r\n\r\n\r\n    “Ach lieber Heere Jhesu Christ\r\n    Sid Du ein Kind gewesen bist,\r\n    So gib ouch disem Kindelin\r\n    Din Gnod und ouch den Segen den.\r\n        Ach Jhesu, Heere min,\r\n        Behüt diz Kindelin.\r\n\r\n    Nun sloff, nun sloff, min Kindelin,\r\n    Jhesus der sol din bülli sin,\r\n    Der well, daz dir getroume wol\r\n    Und werdest aller Tugent vol.\r\n        Ach Jhesus, Heere min,\r\n        Behüt diz Kindelin.”(75)\r\n\r\n\r\nThese songs or hymns, common before the Reformation, were sung as\r\nfrequently after the break with Rome. The continuity in the private\r\ndevotional life before and after the advent of the Reformation is a thing\r\nto be noted. Few hymns were more popular during the last decade of the\r\nfifteenth century than the “In dulci Jubilo” in which Latin and German\r\nmingled. The first and last verses were:\r\n\r\n\r\n    “In dulci jubilo,\r\n    Nun singet und seid froh!\r\n    Unsers Herzens Wonne\r\n    Leit in præsepio,\r\n    Und leuchtet als die Sonne\r\n    Matris in gremio.\r\n    Alpha es et O,\r\n    Alpha es et O!\r\n\r\n    Ubi sunt gaudia?\r\n    Nirgends mehr denn da,\r\n    Da die Engel singen\r\n    Nova cantica,\r\n    Und die Schellen klingen\r\n    In regis curia.\r\n    Eya, wär’n wir da,\r\n    Eya, wär’n wir da!”\r\n\r\n\r\nThis hymn continued to enjoy a wonderful popularity in the German\r\nProtestant churches and families until quite recently, and during the\r\ntimes of the Reformation it spread far beyond Germany.(76) In the\r\nfifteenth-century version it contained one verse in praise of the Virgin:\r\n\r\n\r\n    “Mater et filia\r\n    Du bist, Jungfraw Maria.\r\n    Wir weren all verloren\r\n    Per nostra crimina,\r\n    So hat sy uns erworben\r\n    Celorum gaudia.\r\n    Eya, wär’n wir da,\r\n    Eya, wär’n wir da!”\r\n\r\n\r\nwhich was either omitted in the post-Reformation versions, or there was\r\nsubstituted:\r\n\r\n\r\n    “O Patris charitas,\r\n    O Nati lenitas!\r\n    Wir weren all verloren\r\n    Per nostra crimina,\r\n    So hat Er uns erworben\r\n    Cœlorum gaudia.\r\n    Eya, wär’n wir da,\r\n    Eya, wär’n wir da.”(77)\r\n\r\n\r\nNor was direct simple evangelical instruction lacking. Friedrich Mecum\r\n(known better by his Latinised name of Myconius), who was born in 1491,\r\nrelates how his father, a substantial burgher belonging to Lichtenfels in\r\nUpper Franconia, instructed him in religion while he was a child. “My dear\r\nfather,” he says, “had taught me in my childhood the Ten Commandments, the\r\nLord’s Prayer, and the Creed, and constrained me to pray always. For, said\r\nhe, ‘Everything comes to us from God alone, and that _gratis_, free of\r\ncost, and He will lead us and rule us, if we only diligently pray to\r\nHim.’ ” We can trace this simple evangelical family religion away back\r\nthrough the Middle Ages. In the wonderfully interesting Chronicle of\r\nBrother Salimbene of the Franciscan Convent of Parma, which comes from the\r\nthirteenth century, we are told how many of the better-disposed burghers\r\nof the town came to the convent frequently to enjoy the religious\r\nconversation of Brother Hugh. On one occasion the conversation turned upon\r\nthe mystical theology of Abbot Giaocchino di Fiore. The burghers professed\r\nto be greatly edified, but said that they hoped that on the next evening\r\nBrother Hugh would confine himself to telling them the _simple words of\r\nJesus_.\r\n\r\nThe central thought in all evangelical religion is that the believer does\r\nnot owe his position before God, and his assurance of salvation, to the\r\ngood deeds which he really can do, but to the grace of God manifested in\r\nthe mission and the work of Christ; and the more we turn from the thought\r\nof what we can do to the thought of what God has done for us, the stronger\r\nwill be the conviction that simple trust in God is that by which the\r\npardoning grace of God is appropriated. This double conception—God’s grace\r\ncoming down upon us from above, and the believer’s trust rising from\r\nbeneath to meet and appropriate it—was never absent from the simplest\r\nreligion of the Middle Ages. It did not find articulate expression in\r\nmediæval theology, for, owing to its enforced connection with Aristotelian\r\nphilosophy, that theology was largely artificial; but the thought itself\r\nhad a continuous and constant existence in the public consciousness of\r\nChristian men and women, and appeared in sermons, prayers, and hymns, and\r\nin the other ways in which the devotional life manifested itself. It is\r\nfound in the sermons of the greatest of mediæval preachers, Bernard of\r\nClairvaux, and in the teaching of the most persuasive of religious guides,\r\nFrancis of Assisi. The one, Bernard, in spite of his theological training,\r\nwas able to rise above the thought of human merit recommending the sinner\r\nto God; and the other, Francis, who had no theological training at all,\r\ninsisted that he was fitted to lead a life of imitation simply because he\r\nhad no personal merits whatsoever, and owed everything to the marvellous\r\nmercy and grace of God given freely to him in the work of Christ. The\r\nthought that all the good we can do comes from the wisdom and mercy of\r\nGod, and that without these gifts of grace we are sinful and worthless—the\r\nfeeling that all pardon and all holy living are free gifts of God’s grace,\r\nwas the central thought round which in mediæval, as in all times, the\r\nfaith of simple and pious people twined itself. It found expression in the\r\nsimpler mediæval hymns, Latin and German. The utter need for sin-pardoning\r\ngrace is expressed and taught in the prayer of the _Canon of the Mass_. It\r\nfound its way, in spite of the theology, even into the official agenda of\r\nthe Church, where the dying are told that they must repose their\r\nconfidence upon Christ and His Passion as the sole ground of confidence in\r\ntheir salvation. If we take the fourth book of Thomas à Kempis’ _Imitatio\r\nChristi_, it is impossible to avoid seeing that his ideas about the\r\nsacrament of the Supper (in spite of the mistakes in them) kept alive in\r\nhis mind the thought of a free grace of God, and that he had a clear\r\nconception that God’s grace was freely given, and not merited by what man\r\ncan do. For the main thought with pious mediæval Christians, however it\r\nmight be overlaid with superstitious conceptions, was that they received\r\nin the sacrament a _gift_ of overwhelming greatness. Many a modern\r\nChristian seems to think that the main idea is that in this sacrament one\r\n_does_ something—makes a profession of Christianity. The old view went a\r\nlong way towards keeping people right in spite of errors, while the modern\r\nview does a great deal towards leading them wrong in spite of truth.\r\n\r\nAll these things combine to show us how there was a simple evangelical\r\nfaith among pious mediæval Christians, and that their lives were fed upon\r\nthe same divine truths which lie at the basis of Reformation theology. The\r\ntruths were all there, as poetic thoughts, as earnest supplication and\r\nconfession, in fervent preaching or in fireside teaching. When mediæval\r\nChristians knelt in prayer, stood to sing their Redeemer’s praises, spoke\r\nas a dying man to dying men, or as a mother to the children about her\r\nknees, the words and thoughts that came were what Luther and Zwingli and\r\nCalvin wove into Reformation creeds, and expanded into that experimental\r\ntheology which was characteristic of the Reformation.\r\n\r\nWhen the printing-press began in the last decades of the fifteenth century\r\nto provide little books to aid private and family devotion, it is not\r\nsurprising, after what has been said, to find how full many of them were\r\nof simple evangelical piety. Some contained the Lord’s Prayer, the Ten\r\nCommandments, the Apostles’ Creed, and occasionally a translation or\r\nparaphrase of some of the Psalms, notably the 51st Psalm. Popular\r\nreligious instructions and catechisms for family use were printed. The\r\nCatechism of Dietrich Koelde (written in 1470) says: “Man must place his\r\nfaith and hope and love on God alone, and not in any creature; he must\r\ntrust in nothing but in the work of Jesus Christ.” The\r\n_Seelenwurzgartlein_, a widely used book of devotion, instructs the\r\npenitent: “Thou must place all thy hope and trust on nothing else than on\r\nthe work and death of Jesus Christ.” The _Geistliche Streit_ of Ulrich\r\nKrafft (1503) teaches the dying man to place all his trust on the “mercy\r\nand goodness of God, and not on his own good works.” Quotations might be\r\nmultiplied, all proving the existence of a simple evangelical piety, and\r\nshowing that the home experience of Friedrich Mecum (Myconius) was shared\r\nin by thousands, and that there was a simple evangelical family religion\r\nin numberless German homes in the end of the fifteenth century.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 5. A superstitious Religion based on Fear.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen sensitive, religiously disposed boys left pious homes, they could not\r\nfail to come in contact with a very different kind of religion. Many did\r\nnot need to quit the family circle in order to meet it. Near Mansfeld,\r\nLuther’s home, were noted pilgrimage places. Pilgrims, singly or in great\r\nbands, passed to make their devotions before the wooden cross at\r\nKyffhäuser, which was supposed to effect miraculous cures. The Bruno\r\nQuertfort Chapel and the old chapel at Welfesholz were pilgrimage places.\r\nSick people were carried to spots near the cloister church at Wimmelberg,\r\nwhere they could best hear the sound of the cloister bells, which were\r\nbelieved to have a healing virtue.\r\n\r\nThe latter half of the fifteenth century witnessed a great and\r\nwidespreading religious revival, which prolonged itself into the earlier\r\ndecades of the sixteenth, though the year 1475 may perhaps be taken as its\r\nhigh-water mark. Its most characteristic feature was the impulse to make\r\npilgrimages to favoured shrines; and these pilgrimages were always\r\nconsidered to be something in the nature of satisfactions made to God for\r\nsins. With some of the earlier phenomena we have nothing here to do.\r\n\r\nThe impetus to pilgrimages given after the great Schism by the celebration\r\nin 1456 of the first Jubilee “after healing the wounds of the Church”; the\r\nrelation of these pilgrimages to the doctrines of Indulgences which,\r\nformulated by the great Schoolmen of the thirteenth century, had changed\r\nthe whole penitential system of the mediæval Church, must be passed over;\r\nthe curious socialist, anti-clerical, and yet deeply superstitious\r\nmovement led by the cowherd and village piper, Hans Böhm, has been\r\ndescribed. But one movement is so characteristic of the times, that it\r\nmust be noticed. In the years 1455-1459 all the chroniclers describe great\r\ngatherings of children from every part of Germany, from town and village,\r\nwho, with crosses and banners, went on pilgrimage to St. Michael in\r\nNormandy. The chronicler of Lübeck compares the spread of the movement to\r\nthe advance of the plague, and wonders whether the prompting arose from\r\nthe inspiration of God or from the instigation of the devil. When a band\r\nof these child-pilgrims reached a town, carrying aloft crosses and banners\r\nblazoned with a rude image of St. Michael, singing their special pilgrim\r\nsong,(78) the town’s children were impelled to join them. How this strange\r\nepidemic arose, and what put an end to it, seems altogether doubtful; but\r\nthe chronicles of almost every important town in Germany attest the facts,\r\nand the contemporary records of North France describe the bands of\r\nyouthful pilgrims who traversed the country to go to St. Michael’s Mount.\r\n\r\nDuring these last decades of the fifteenth century, a great fear seems to\r\nhave brooded over Central Europe. The countries were scourged by incessant\r\nvisits of the plague; new diseases, never before heard of, came to swell\r\nthe terror of the people. The alarm of a Turkish invasion was always\r\nbefore their eyes. Bells tolled at midday in hundreds of German parishes,\r\ncalling the parishioners together for prayer against the incoming of the\r\nTurks, and served to keep the dread always present to their minds. Mothers\r\nthreatened their disobedient children by calling on the Turk to come and\r\ntake them. It was fear that lay at the basis of this crude revival of\r\nreligion which marks the closing decades of the fifteenth century. It gave\r\nrise to an urgent restlessness. Prophecies of evil were easily believed\r\nin. Astrologers assumed a place and wielded a power which was as new as it\r\nwas strange. The credulous people welcomed all kinds of revelations and\r\nproclamations of miraculous signs. At Wilsnack, a village in one of the\r\ndivisions of Brandenburg (Priegnitz), it had been alleged since 1383 that\r\na consecrated wafer secreted the Blood of Christ. Suddenly, in 1475,\r\npeople were seized with a desire to make a pilgrimage to this shrine.\r\nSwarms of child-pilgrims again filled the roads—boys and girls, from eight\r\nto eighteen years of age, bareheaded, clad only in their shirts, shouting,\r\n“O Lord, have mercy upon us”—going to Wilsnack. Sometimes schoolmasters\r\nheaded a crowd of pilgrims; mothers deserted their younger children;\r\ncountry lads and maids left their work in the fields to join the\r\nprocessions. These pilgrims came mostly from Central Germany (1100 from\r\nEisleben alone), but the contagion spread to Austria and Hungary, and\r\ngreat bands of youthful pilgrims appeared from these countries. They\r\ntravelled without provisions, and depended on the charity of the peasants\r\nfor food. Large numbers of these child-pilgrims did not know why they had\r\njoined the throng; they had never heard of the _Bleeding Host_ towards\r\nwhich they were journeying; when asked why they had set out, they could\r\nonly answer that they could not help it, that they saw the red cross at\r\nthe head of their little band, and had to follow it. Many of them could\r\nnot speak, all went weeping and groaning, shivering as if they had a fit\r\nof ague. An unnatural strength supported them. Little boys and girls, some\r\nof them not eight years old, from a small village near Bamberg, were said\r\nto have marched, on their first setting forth, all day and the first night\r\nthe incredible distance of not less than eighty miles! Some towns tried to\r\nput a stop to these pilgrimages. Erfurt shut its gates against the\r\nyouthful companies. The pilgrimages ended as suddenly as they had\r\nbegun.(79)\r\n\r\nSucceeding years witnessed similar astonishing pilgrimages—in 1489, to the\r\n“black Mother of God” in Altötting; in 1492, to the “Holy Blood” at\r\nSternberg; in the same year, to the “pitiful Bone” at Dornach; in 1499, to\r\nthe picture of the Blessed Virgin at Grimmenthal; in 1500, to the head of\r\nSt. Anna at Düren; and in 1519, to the “Beautiful Mary” at Regensburg.\r\n\r\nApart altogether from these sporadic movements, the last decades of the\r\nfifteenth century were pre-eminently a time of pilgrimages. German princes\r\nand wealthy merchants made pilgrimages to the Holy Land, visited the\r\nsacred places there, and returned with numerous relics, which they stored\r\nin favourite churches. Frederick the Wise, the Elector of Saxony, to be\r\nknown afterwards as the protector of Luther, made such a pilgrimage, and\r\nplaced the relics he had acquired in the Castle Church (the Church of All\r\nSaints) in Wittenberg. He became an assiduous collector of relics, and had\r\ncommissioners on the Rhine, in the Netherlands, and at Venice, with orders\r\nto procure him any sacred novelties they met with for sale.(80) He\r\nprocured from the Pope an Indulgence for all who visited the collection\r\nand took part in the services of the church on All Saints’ Day; for it is\r\none of the ironies of history that the church on whose door Luther nailed\r\nhis theses against Indulgences was one of the sacred edifices on which an\r\nIndulgence had been bestowed, and that the day selected by Luther was the\r\nyearly anniversary, which drew crowds to benefit by it.(81)\r\n\r\nA pilgrimage to the Holy Land was too costly and dangerous to be indulged\r\nin by many. The richer Germans made pilgrimages to Rome, and the great\r\npilgrimage place for the middle-class or poorer Germans was Compostella in\r\nSpain. Einsiedeln, in Switzerland, also attracted yearly swarms of\r\npilgrims.\r\n\r\nGuide-books were written for the benefit of these pious travellers, and\r\ntwo of them, the most popular, have recently been reprinted. They are the\r\n_Mirabilia Romæ_ for Roman pilgrims, and the _Walfart und Strasse zu Sant\r\nJacob_ for travellers to Compostella. These little books had a wonderful\r\npopularity. The _Mirabilia Romæ_ went through nineteen Latin and at least\r\ntwelve German editions before the year 1500; it was also translated into\r\nItalian and Dutch. It describes the various shrines at Rome where pilgrims\r\nmay win special gifts of grace by visiting and worshipping at them. Who\r\ngoes to the Lateran Church and worships there has “forgiveness of all\r\nsins, both guilt and penalty.” There is “a lovely little chapel” (probably\r\nwhat is now called the Lateran Baptistry) near the Lateran, where the same\r\nprivileges may be won. The pilgrim who goes with good intention to the\r\nHigh Altar of St. Peter’s Church, “even if he has murdered his father or\r\nhis mother,” is freed from all sin, “guilt as well as penalty,” provided\r\nhe repents. The virtues of St. Croce seem to have been rated even higher.\r\nIf a man leaves his house with the intention of going to the shrine, even\r\nif he die by the way, all his sins are forgiven him; and if he visits the\r\nchurch he wins a thousand years’ relief from Purgatory.(82)\r\n\r\nCompostella in Spain was the people’s pilgrimage place. Before the\r\ninvention of printing we find traces of manuscript guides to travellers,\r\nwhich were no doubt circulated among intending pilgrims, and afterwards\r\nthe services of the printing-press were early called in to assist. In the\r\nSpanish archives at Simancas there are two single sheets, one of which\r\nstates the numerous Indulgences for the benefit of visitors at the shrine\r\nof St. James, while the other enumerates the relics which are to be seen\r\nand visited there. It mentions thirty-nine great relics—from the bones of\r\nSt. James, which lay under the great altar of the cathedral, to those of\r\nSt. Susanna, which were interred in a church outside the walls of the\r\ntown.(83) These leaflets were sold to the pilgrims, and were carried back\r\nby them to Germany, where they stimulated the zeal and devotion of those\r\nwho intended to make the pilgrimage. Our pilgrim’s guide-book, the\r\n_Walfart und Strasse zu Sant Jacob_,(84) deals almost exclusively with the\r\nroad. The author was a certain Hermann Künig of Vach, who calls himself a\r\n_Mergen-knecht_, or servant of the Virgin Mary. The well-known pilgrim\r\nsong, “Of Saint James” (_Von Sant Jacob_), told how those who reached the\r\nend of their journey got, through the intercession of St. James,\r\nforgiveness from the guilt and penalty (_von Pein und Schuldt_) of all\r\ntheir sins; it tells the pilgrims to provide themselves with two pairs of\r\nshoes, a water-bottle and spoon, a satchel and staff, a broad-brimmed hat\r\nand a cloak, both trimmed with leather in the places likeliest to be\r\nfrayed, and both needed as a protection against wind and rain and\r\nsnow.(85) It charges them to take permits from their parish priests to\r\ndispense with confession, for they were going to foreign lands where they\r\nwould not find priests who spoke German. It warns them that they might die\r\nfar from home and find a grave on the pilgrimage route. Our guide-book\r\nomits all these things. It is written by a man who has made the pilgrimage\r\non foot; who had observed minutely all the turns of the road, and could\r\nwarn fellow-pilgrims of the difficulties of the way. He gives the\r\nitinerary from town to town; where to turn to the right and where to the\r\nleft; what conspicuous buildings mark the proper path; where the traveller\r\nwill find people who are generous to poor pilgrims, and where the\r\ninhabitants are uncharitable and food and drink must be paid for; where\r\nhostels abound, and those parts of the road on which there are few, and\r\nwhere the pilgrims must buy their provisions beforehand and carry them in\r\ntheir satchels; where sick pilgrims can find hospitals on the way, and\r\nwhat treatment they may expect there;(86) at what hostels they must change\r\ntheir money into French and Spanish coin. In brief, the booklet is a\r\nmediæval “Baedeker,” compiled with German accuracy for the benefit of\r\nGerman pilgrims to the renowned shrine of St. James of Compostella. This\r\nlittle book went through several editions between 1495 and 1521, and is of\r\nitself a proof of the popularity of this pilgrimage place. In the last\r\ndecades of the fifteenth century there arose a body of men and women who\r\nmight be called professional pilgrims, and who were continually on the\r\nroad between Germany and Spain. A pilgrimage was one of the earliest\r\nso-called “satisfactions” which might be done vicariously, and the\r\nBrethren of St. James (_Jacobs-Brueder_) made the pilgrimage regularly,\r\neither on behalf of themselves or of others.\r\n\r\nMany of these pilgrims were men and women of indifferent character,(87)\r\nwho had been sent on a pilgrimage as an ecclesiastical punishment for\r\ntheir sins. The _Chronicles of the Zimmer Family_(88) gives several cases\r\nof criminals, who had committed murder or theft or other serious crimes\r\nbetween 1490 and 1520, who were sent to Santiago as a punishment. Even in\r\nthe last decades of the fifteenth century, when the greater part of the\r\npilgrims were devout in their way, it was known only too well that\r\npilgrimages were not helpful to a moral life. Stern preachers of\r\nrighteousness like Geiler of Keysersberg and Berchtold of Regensburg\r\ndenounced pilgrimages, and said that they created more sins than they\r\nyielded pardons.(89) Parish priests continually forbade their women\r\npenitents, especially if they were unmarried, from going on a pilgrimage.\r\nBut these warnings and rebukes were in vain. The prevailing terror had\r\npossessed the people, and they journeyed from shrine to shrine seeking\r\nsome relief for their stricken consciences.\r\n\r\nA marked characteristic of this revival which found such striking outcome\r\nin these pilgrimages was the thought that Jesus was to be looked upon as\r\nthe Judge who was to come to punish the wicked. His saving and\r\nintercessory work was thrust into the background. Men forgot that He was\r\nthe Saviour and the Intercessor; and as the human heart craves for someone\r\nto intercede for it, another intercessor had to be found. This gracious\r\npersonality was discovered in the Virgin Mother, who was to be entreated\r\nto intercede with her Son on behalf of poor sinning human creatures. The\r\nlast half of the fifteenth century saw a deep-seated and widely-spread\r\ncraving to cling to the protection of the Virgin Mother with a strength\r\nand intensity hitherto unknown in mediæval religion. It witnessed the\r\nfurthest advance that had yet been made towards what must be called\r\nMariolatry. This devotion expressed itself, as religious emotion\r\ncontinually does, in hymns; a very large proportion of the mediæval hymns\r\nin praise of the Virgin were written in the second half of the fifteenth\r\ncentury—the period of this strange revival based upon fear. Dread of the\r\nSon as Judge gave rise to the devotion to the Mother as the intercessor.\r\nLittle books for private and family devotion were printed, bearing such\r\ntitles as the _Pearl of the Passion_ and the _Little Gospel_, containing,\r\nwith long comments, the words of our Lord on the cross to John and to\r\nMary. She became the ideal woman, the ideal mother, the “Mother of God,”\r\nthe _mater dolorosa_, with her heart pierced by the sword, the sharer in\r\nthe redemptive sufferings of her Son, retaining her sensitive woman’s\r\nheart, ready to listen to the appeals of a suffering, sorrowful humanity.\r\nWe can see this devotion to the Virgin Mother impregnating the social\r\nrevolts from Hans Böhm to Joss Fritz. The theology of the schools followed\r\nin the wake of the popular sentiment, and the doctrine of the Immaculate\r\nConception was more strictly defined and found its most strenuous\r\nsupporters during the later decades of this fifteenth century.\r\n\r\nThe thought of motherly intercession went further; the Virgin herself had\r\nto be interceded with to induce her to plead with her Son for men sunk in\r\nsin, and _her_ mother (St. Anna) became the object of a cult which may\r\nalmost be said to be quite new. Hymns were written in her praise.(90)\r\nConfraternities, modelled on the confraternities dedicated to the Blessed\r\nVirgin, were formed in order to bring the power of the prayers of numbers\r\nto bear upon her. These confraternities spread all over Germany and beyond\r\nit.(91) It is almost possible to trace the widening area of the cult from\r\nthe chronicles of the period. The special cult of the Virgin seems to have\r\nbegun, at least in its extravagant popular form, in North France, and to\r\nhave spread from France through Germany and Spain; but so far as it can be\r\ntraced, this cult of St. Anna, “the Grandmother,” had a German origin, and\r\nthe devotion manifested itself most deeply on German soil. Even the\r\nHumanist poets sang her praises with enthusiasm, and such collectors of\r\nrelics as Frederick of Saxony and the Cardinal Archbishop of Mainz\r\nrejoiced when they were able to add a thumb of St. Anna to their store.\r\nLuther himself tells us that “St. Anna was his idol”; and Calvin speaks of\r\nhis mother’s devotion to the saint. Her name was graven on many a parish\r\nchurch bell, and every pull at the ropes and clang of the bell was\r\nsupposed to be a prayer to her to intercede. The Virgin and St. Anna\r\nbrought in their train other saints who were also believed to be the true\r\nintercessors. The three bells of the church in which Luther was baptized\r\nbore the following inscriptions carved deeply in the brass:—“God help us;\r\nMary have mercy. 1499.” “Help us Anna, also St. Peter, St. Paul. 1509.”\r\n“Help us God, Mary, Anna, St. Peter, Paul, Arnold, Stephan, Simon. 1509.”\r\nThe popular religion always represented Jesus, Mecum (Myconius) tells us,\r\nas the stern Judge who would convict and punish all those who had not\r\nsecured righteousness by the intercession of the saints or by their own\r\ngood works.\r\n\r\nThis revival of religion, crude as it was, and based on fear, had a\r\ndistinct effect for good on a portion of the clergy, and led to a great\r\nreformation of morals among those who came under its influence. The papal\r\nSchism, which had lasted till 1449, had for one of its results the\r\nweakening of all ecclesiastical discipline, and its consequences were seen\r\nin the growing immorality which pervaded all classes of the clergy. So far\r\nas one can judge, the revival of religion described above had not very\r\nmuch effect on the secular clergy. Whether we take the evidence from the\r\nchronicles of the time or from visitations of the bishops, the morals of\r\nthe parish priests were extremely low, and the private lives of the higher\r\nclergy in Germany notoriously corrupt. The occupants of episcopal sees\r\nwere for the most part the younger brothers of the great princes, and had\r\nbeen placed in the religious life for the sake of the ecclesiastical\r\nrevenues. The author of the _Chronicles of the Zimmer Family_ tells us\r\nthat at the festive gatherings which accompanied the meetings of the Diet,\r\nthe young nobles, lay and clerical, spent most of their time at dice and\r\ncards. As he passed through the halls, picking his way among groups of\r\nyoung nobles lying on the floor (for tables and chairs were rare in these\r\ndays), he continually heard the young count call out to the young bishop,\r\n“Play up, parson; it is your turn.” The same writer describes the retinue\r\nof a great prelate, who was always accompanied to the Diet by a concubine\r\ndressed in man’s clothes. Nor were the older Orders of monks, the\r\nBenedictines and their offshoots, greatly influenced by the revival. It\r\nwas different, however, with those Orders of monks who came into close\r\ncontact with the people, and caught from them the new fervour. The\r\nDominicans, the great preaching Order, were permeated by reform. The\r\nFranciscans, who had degenerated sadly from their earlier lives of\r\nself-denial, partook of a new life. Convent after convent reformed itself,\r\nand the inmates began to lead again the lives their founder had\r\ncontemplated. The fire of the revival, however, burnt brightest among the\r\nAugustinian Eremites, the Order which Luther joined, and they represented,\r\nas none of the others did, all the characteristics of the new movement.\r\n\r\nThese Augustinian Eremites had a somewhat curious history. They had\r\nnothing in common with St. Augustine save the name, and the fact that a\r\nPope had given them the rule of St. Augustine as a basis for their\r\nmonastic constitution. They had originally been hermits, living solitary\r\nlives in mountainous parts of Italy and of Germany. Many Popes had desired\r\nto bring them under conventual rule, and this was at last successfully\r\ndone. They shared as no other Order had done in the revival of the second\r\nhalf of the fifteenth century, and exhibited in their lives all its\r\nreligious characteristics. No Order of monks contained such devoted\r\nservants of the Virgin Mother. She was the patron along with St.\r\nAugustine. Her image stood in the chapter-house of every convent. The\r\ntheologians of the Augustinian Eremites vied with those of the Franciscans\r\nin spreading the doctrine of the Immaculate Conception. They did much to\r\nspread the cult of the “Blessed Anna.” They were devoted to the Papacy.\r\nOne of their learned men, John of Palz, one of the two professors of\r\ntheology in the Erfurt Convent when Luther entered it as a novice, was the\r\nmost strenuous defender of the doctrine of Attrition and of the religious\r\nvalue of Indulgences. With all this their lives were more self-denying\r\nthan those of most monks. They cultivated theological learning, and few\r\nUniversities in Germany were without an Augustinian Eremite who acted as\r\nprofessor of philosophy or of theology. They also paid great attention to\r\nthe art of preaching, and every large monastery had a special preacher who\r\nattracted crowds of the laity to the convent chapel. Their monasteries\r\nwere usually placed in large towns; and their devout lives, their\r\nlearning, and the popular gifts of their preachers, made them favourites\r\nwith the townspeople. They were the most esteemed Order in Germany.\r\n\r\nThese last decades of the fifteenth century were the days of the\r\nresuscitation of the mendicant Orders and the revival of their power over\r\nthe people. The better disposed among the princes and among the wealthier\r\nburghers invariably selected their confessors from the monks of the\r\nmendicant Orders, and especially from the Augustinian Eremites. The\r\nchapels of the Franciscans and of the Eremites were thronged, and those of\r\nthe parish clergy were deserted. The common people took for their\r\nreligious guides men who shared the new revival, and who proved their\r\nsincerity by self-denying labours. It was in vain that the Roman Curia\r\npublished regulations insisting that every parishioner must confess to the\r\npriest of the parish at least once a year, and that it explained again and\r\nagain that the personal character of the ministrant did not affect the\r\nefficacy of the sacraments administered by him. So long as poorly clad,\r\nemaciated, clean-living Franciscan or Eremite priests could be found to\r\nact as confessors, priests, or preachers, the people deserted the parish\r\nclergy, flocked to their confessionals, waited on their serving the Mass,\r\nand thronged their chapels to listen to their sermons. These decades were\r\nthe time of the last revival of the mendicant monks, who were the\r\nreligious guides in this flamboyant popular religion which is so much in\r\nevidence during our period.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 6. A non-Ecclesiastical Religion.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe third religious movement which belongs to the last decades of the\r\nfifteenth and the earlier decades of the sixteenth century was of a kind\r\nso different from, and even contrary to, what has just been described,\r\nthat it is with some surprise that the student finds he must recognise its\r\npresence alongside of the other. It was the silent spread of a quiet,\r\nsincere, but non-ecclesiastical religion. Historians usually say nothing\r\nabout this movement, and it is only a minute study of the town chronicles\r\nand of the records of provincial and municipal legislation that reveals\r\nits power and extent. It has always been recognised that Luther’s father\r\nwas a man of a deeply religious turn of mind, although he commonly\r\ndespised the clergy, and thought that most monks were rogues or fools; but\r\nwhat is not recognised is that in this he represented thousands of quiet\r\nand pious Germans in all classes of society. We find traces of the silent,\r\nwidespreading movement in the ecclesiastical legislation of German\r\nprinces, in the police regulations, and in the provisions for the support\r\nof the poor among the burghers; in the constitutions and practices of the\r\nconfraternities among the lower classes, and especially among the artisans\r\nin the towns; and in the numerous translations of the Vulgate into the\r\nvernacular.\r\n\r\nThe reforms sketched by the Councils of Constance and of Basel had been\r\nutterly neglected by the Roman Curia, and in consequence several German\r\nprinces, while they felt the hopelessness of insisting on a general\r\npurification of the Church, resolved that these reforms should be carried\r\nout within their own dominions. As early as 1446, Duke William of Saxony\r\nhad published decrees which interfered with the pretensions of the Church\r\nto be quite independent of the State. His regulations about the observance\r\nof the Sunday, his forbidding ecclesiastical courts to interfere with\r\nSaxon laymen, his stern refusal to allow any Saxon to appeal to a foreign\r\njurisdiction, were all more or less instances of the interference of the\r\nsecular power within what had been supposed to be the exclusive province\r\nof the ecclesiastical. He went much further, however. He enacted that it\r\nbelonged to the secular power to see that parish priests and their\r\nsuperiors within his dominions lived lives befitting their vocation—a\r\nconception which was entirely at variance with the ecclesiastical\r\npretensions of the Middle Ages. He also declared it to be within the\r\nprovince of the secular power to visit officially and to reform all the\r\nconvents within his dominions. So far as proofs go, it is probable that\r\nthese declarations about the rights of the civil authorities to exercise\r\ndiscipline over the parish priests and their superiors remained a dead\r\nletter. We hear of no such reformation being carried out. But the\r\nvisitation of the Saxon monasteries was put in force in spite of the\r\nprotests of the ecclesiastical powers. Andreas Proles would never have\r\nbeen able to carry out his proposals of reform in the convents of the\r\nAugustinian Eremites but for the support he received from the secular\r\nprinces against his ecclesiastical superiors in Rome. The Dukes Ernest and\r\nAlbrecht carried out Duke William’s conceptions about the relation of the\r\ncivil to the ecclesiastical authorities in their ordinances of 1483, and\r\nthe Elector Frederick the Wise was heir to this ecclesiastical policy of\r\nhis family.\r\n\r\nThe records of the Electorate of Brandenburg, investigated by Priebatsch\r\nand described by him in the _Zeitschrift für Kirchengeschichte_(92)\r\ntestify to the same ideas at work there. A pious prince like Frederick II.\r\nof Brandenburg removed unworthy Church dignitaries and reinstituted them,\r\nthus taking upon himself the oversight of the Church. Appeals to Rome were\r\nforbidden under penalties. Gradually under Frederick and his successors\r\nthere arose what was practically a national Church of Brandenburg, which\r\nwas almost completely under the control of the civil power, and almost\r\nentirely separated from Roman control.\r\n\r\nThe towns also interfered in what had hitherto been believed to be within\r\nthe exclusive domain of the ecclesiastical authorities. They recognised\r\nthe harm which the numerous Church festivals and saints’ days were doing\r\nto the people, and passed regulations about their observance, all of them\r\ntending to lessen the number of the days on which men were compelled by\r\necclesiastical law to be idle. When Luther pleaded in his _Address to the\r\nNobility of the German Nation_ for the abolition of the ecclesiastical\r\nlaws enforcing idleness on the numerous ecclesiastical holy days, he only\r\nsuggested an extension and wider application of the police regulations\r\nwhich were in force within his native district of Mansfeld.\r\n\r\nThis non-ecclesiastical feeling appears strongly in the change of view\r\nabout Christian charity which marks the close of the fifteenth century.\r\n\r\nNothing shows how the Church of the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries\r\nhad instilled the mind of Jesus into the peoples of Europe like the zeal\r\nwith which they tried to do their duty by the poor, the sick, and the\r\nhelpless. Institutions, founded by individuals or by corporations, for the\r\npurpose of housing the destitute abounded, and men and women willingly\r\ndedicated themselves to the service of the unfortunate.\r\n\r\n\r\n    “The Beguins crowned with flapping hats,\r\n    O’er long-drawn bloodless faces blank,\r\n    And gowns unwashed to wrap their lank\r\n    Lean figures,”(93)\r\n\r\n\r\nwere sisters of mercy in every mediæval town. Unfortunately the lessons of\r\nthe Church included the thought that begging was a Christian virtue; while\r\nthe idea that because charity is taught by the law of Christ, its exercise\r\nmust be everywhere superintended by ecclesiastics, was elevated to a\r\ndefinite principle of action, if not to something directly commanded by\r\nthe law of God. The Reformation protested against these two ideas, and the\r\nsilent anticipation of this protest is to be found in the\r\nnon-ecclesiastical piety of the close of the fifteenth century.\r\n\r\nThe practice of begging, its toleration and even encouragement, was almost\r\nuniversal. In some of the benevolent institutions the sick and the\r\npensioners were provided from the endowment with all the necessaries of\r\nlife, but it was generally thought becoming that they should beg them from\r\nthe charitable. The very fact of begging seemed to raise those who shared\r\nin it to the level of members of a religious association. St. Francis, the\r\n“imitator of Christ,” had taught his followers to beg, and this great\r\nexample sanctified the practice. It is true that the begging friars were\r\nalways the butt of the satirists of the close of the fifteenth century.\r\nThey delighted to portray the mendicant monk, with his sack, into which he\r\nseemed able to stuff everything: honey and spice, nutmegs, pepper, and\r\npreserved ginger, cabbage and eggs, poultry, fish, and new clothes, milk,\r\nbutter, and cheese; cheese especially, and of all kinds—ewe’s milk and\r\ngoat’s milk, hard cheese and soft cheese, large cheeses and small\r\ncheeses—were greedily demanded by these “cheese hunters,” as they were\r\nsatirically called. On their heels tramped a host of semi-ecclesiastical\r\nbeggars, all of them with professional names—men who begged for a church\r\nthat was building, or for an altar-cloth, or to hansel a young priest at\r\nhis first Mass; men who carried relics about for the charitable to\r\nkiss—some straw from the manger of Bethlehem, or a feather from the wing\r\nof the angel Gabriel; the Brethren of St. James, who performed continual\r\nand vicarious pilgrimages to Compostella, and sometimes robbed and\r\nmurdered on the road; the Brethren of St. Anthony, who had the special\r\nprivilege of wearing a cross and carrying a bell on their begging visits.\r\nThese were all ecclesiastical beggars. The ordinary beggars did their best\r\nto obtain some share of the sanctity which surrounded the profession; they\r\ncarried with them the picture of some saint, or placed the cockle-shell,\r\nthe badge of a pilgrim, in their hats, and secured a quasi-ecclesiastical\r\nstanding.(94) Luther expressed not merely his own opinion on this plague\r\nof beggars in his _Address to the Nobility of the German Nation_, but what\r\nhad been thought and partially practised by quiet laymen for several\r\ndecades. Some towns began to make regulations against promiscuous begging\r\nby able-bodied persons, provided work for them, seized their children, and\r\ntaught them trades—all of which sensible doings were against the spirit of\r\nthe mediæval Church.\r\n\r\nThe non-ecclesiastical religious feeling, however, appears much more\r\nclearly when the history of the charitable foundations is examined. The\r\ninvariable custom during the earlier Middle Ages was that charitable\r\nbequests were left to the management of the Church and the clergy. At the\r\nclose of the fifteenth century the custom began to alter. The change from\r\nclerical to lay management was at first probably due mainly to the\r\ndegeneracy of the clergy, and to the belief that the funds set apart for\r\nthe poor were not properly administered. The evidences of this are to be\r\nfound in numerous instances of the civic authorities attempting, and\r\nsuccessfully, to take the management of charitable foundations out of the\r\nhands of ecclesiastical authorities, and to vest them in lay management.\r\nBut this cannot have been the case always. We should rather say that it\r\nbegan to dawn upon men that although charity was part of the law of\r\nChrist, this did not necessarily mean that all charities must be placed\r\nunder the control of the clergy or other ecclesiastical administrators.\r\nHence we find during the later years of the fifteenth century continual\r\ninstances of bequests for the poor placed in the hands of the town council\r\nor of boards of laymen. That this was done without any animus against the\r\nChurch is proved by the fact that the same testator is found giving\r\nbenefactions to foundations which are under clerical and to others under\r\nlay management. Out of the funds thus accumulated the town councils began\r\na system of caring for the poor of the city, which consisted in giving\r\ntokens which could be exchanged for so much bread or woollen cloth, or\r\nshoes, or wood for firing, at the shops of dealers who were engaged for\r\nthe purpose. How far this new and previously unheard of lay management, in\r\nwhat had hitherto been the peculiar possession of the clergy, had spread\r\nbefore the close of the fifteenth century, it is impossible to say. No\r\narchæologist has yet made an exhaustive study of the evidence lying buried\r\nin archives of the mediæval towns of Germany; but enough has been\r\ncollected by Kriegk(95) and others to show that it had become very\r\nextensive. The laity saw that they were quite able to perform this\r\npeculiarly Christian work apart from any clerical direction.\r\n\r\nAnother interesting series of facts serves also to show the growth of a\r\nnon-ecclesiastical religious sentiment. The later decades of the fifteenth\r\ncentury saw the rise of innumerable associations, some of them definitely\r\nreligious, and all of them with a religious side, which are unlike what we\r\nmeet with earlier. They did not aim to be, like the praying circles of the\r\nMystics or of the _Gottesfreunde, ecclesiolæ in ecclesia_, strictly\r\nnon-clerical or even anti-clerical. They had no difficulty in placing\r\nthemselves under the protection of the Church, in selecting the ordinary\r\necclesiastical buildings for their special services, and in employing\r\npriests to conduct their devotions; but they were distinctively lay\r\nassociations, and lived a religious life in their own way, without any\r\nregard to the conceptions of the higher Christian life which the Church\r\nwas accustomed to present to its devout disciples. Some were associations\r\nfor prayer; others for the promotion of the “cult” of a special saint,\r\nlike the confraternities dedicated to the Virgin Mother or the\r\nassociations which spread the “cult” of the Blessed Anna; but by far the\r\nlargest number were combinations of artisans, and resembled the workmen’s\r\n“gilds” of the Roman Empire.\r\n\r\nPerhaps one of the best known of these associations formed for the purpose\r\nof encouraging prayer was the “Brotherhood of the Eleven Thousand\r\nVirgins,” commonly known under the quaint name of _St. Ursula’s Little\r\nShip_. The association was conceived by a Carthusian monk of Cologne, and\r\nit speedily became popular. Frederick the Wise was one of its patrons, his\r\nsecretary, Dr. Pfeffinger, one of its supporters; it numbered its\r\nassociates by the thousand; its praises were sung in a quaint old German\r\nhymn.(96) No money dues were exacted from its members. The only duty\r\nexacted was to pray regularly, and to learn to better one’s life through\r\nthe power of prayer. This was one type of the pious brotherhoods of the\r\nfifteenth century. It was the best known of its kind, and there were many\r\nothers. But among the brotherhoods which bear testimony to the spread of a\r\nnon-ecclesiastical piety none are more important than the confraternities\r\nwhich went by the names of _Kalands_ or _Kalandsgilden_ in North Germany\r\nand _Zechen_ in Austria. These associations were useful in a variety of\r\nways. They were unions for the practice of religion; for mutual aid in\r\ntimes of sickness; for defence in attack; and they also served the purpose\r\nof insurance societies and of burial clubs. It is with their religious\r\nside that we have here to do. It was part of the bond of association that\r\nall the brethren and sisters (for women were commonly admitted) should\r\nmeet together at stated times for a common religious service. The\r\nbrotherhood selected the church in which this was held, and so far as we\r\ncan see the chapels of the Franciscans or of the Augustinian Eremites were\r\ngenerally chosen. Sometimes an altar was relegated to their exclusive use;\r\nsometimes, if the church was a large one, a special chapel. The\r\ninteresting thing to be noticed is that the rules and the modes of\r\nconducting the religious services of the association were entirely in the\r\nhands of the brotherhood itself, and that these laymen insisted on\r\nregulating them in their own way. Luther has a very interesting sermon,\r\nentitled _Sermon upon the venerable Sacrament of the holy true Body of\r\nChrist and of the Brotherhoods_, the latter half of which is devoted to a\r\ncontrast between good brotherhoods and evil ones. Those brotherhoods are\r\nevil, says Luther, in which the religion of the brethren is expressed in\r\nhearing a Mass on one or two days of the year, while by guzzling and\r\ndrinking continually at the meetings of the brotherhood, they contrive to\r\nserve the devil the greater part of their time. A true brotherhood spreads\r\nits table for its poorer members, it aids those who are sick or infirm, it\r\nprovides marriage portions for worthy young members of the association. He\r\nends with a comparison between the true brotherhood and the Church of\r\nChrist. Theodore Kolde remarks that a careful monograph on the\r\nbrotherhoods of the end of the fifteenth century in the light of this\r\nsermon of Luther’s would afford great information about the popular\r\nreligion of the period. Unfortunately, no one has yet attempted the task,\r\nbut German archæologists are slowly preparing the way by printing, chiefly\r\nfrom MS. sources, accounts of the constitution and practices of many of\r\nthese Kalands.\r\n\r\nFrom all this it may be seen that there was in these last decades of the\r\nfifteenth and in the earlier of the sixteenth centuries the growth of what\r\nmay be called a non-ecclesiastical piety, which was quietly determined to\r\nbring within the sphere of the laity very much that had been supposed to\r\nbelong exclusively to the clergy. The _jus episcopale_ which Luther\r\nclaimed for the civil authorities in his tract on the _Liberty of the\r\nChristian Man_, had, in part at least, been claimed and exercised in\r\nseveral of the German principalities and municipalities; the practice of\r\nChristian charity and its management were being taken out of the hands of\r\nthe clergy and entrusted to the laity; and the brotherhoods were making it\r\napparent that men could mark out their religious duties in a way deemed\r\nmost suitable for themselves without asking any aid from the Church,\r\nfurther than to engage a priest whom they trusted to conduct divine\r\nservice and say the Masses they had arranged for.\r\n\r\nThe appearance of numerous translations of the Scriptures into the\r\nvernacular, unauthorised by the officials of the mediæval Church, and\r\njealously suspected by them, appears to confirm the growth and spread of\r\nthis non-ecclesiastical piety. The relation of the Church of the Middle\r\nAges, earlier and later, to vernacular translations of the Vulgate is a\r\ncomplex question. The Scriptures were always declared to be the supreme\r\nsource and authority for all questions of doctrines and morals, and in the\r\nearlier stages of the Reformation controversy the supreme authority of the\r\nHoly Scriptures was not supposed to be one of the matters in dispute\r\nbetween the contending parties. This is evident when we remember that the\r\n_Augsburg __ Confession_, unlike the later confessions of the Reformed\r\nChurches, does not contain any article affirming the supreme authority of\r\nScripture. That was not supposed to be a matter of debate. It was reserved\r\nfor the Council of Trent, for the first time, to place _traditiones sine\r\nScripto_ on the same level of authority with the Scriptures of the Old and\r\nNew Testaments. Hence, many of the small books, issued from convent\r\npresses for the instruction of the people during the decades preceding the\r\nReformation, frequently declare that the whole teaching of the Church is\r\nto be found within the books of the Holy Scriptures.\r\n\r\nIt is, of course, undoubted that the mediæval Church forbade over and over\r\nagain the reading of the Scriptures in the Vulgate and especially in the\r\nvernacular, but it may be asserted that these prohibitions were almost\r\nalways connected with attempts to suppress heretical or schismatic\r\nrevolts.(97)\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, no official encouragement of the reading of the\r\nScriptures in the vernacular by the people can be found during the whole\r\nof the Middle Ages, nor any official patronage of vernacular translations.\r\nThe utmost that was done in the way of tolerating, it can scarcely be said\r\nof encouraging, a knowledge of the vernacular Scriptures was the issue of\r\nPsalters in the vernacular, of Service-Books, and, in the fifteenth\r\ncentury, of the _Plenaria_—little books which contained translations of\r\nsome of the paragraphs of the Gospels and Epistles read in the Church\r\nservice accompanied with legends and popular tales. Translations of the\r\nScriptures were continually reprobated by Popes and primates for various\r\nreasons.(98) It is also unquestionable that a knowledge of the Scriptures\r\nin the vernacular, especially by uneducated men and women, was almost\r\nalways deemed a sign of heretical tendency. “The third cause of heresy,”\r\nsays an Austrian inquisitor, writing about the end of the thirteenth\r\ncentury, “is that they translate the Old and New Testaments into the\r\nvulgar tongue; and so they learn and teach. I have heard and seen a\r\ncertain country clown who repeated the Book of Job word for word, and\r\nseveral who knew the New Testament perfectly.”(99) A survey of the\r\nevidence seems to lead to the conclusion that the rulers of the mediæval\r\nChurch regarded a knowledge of the vernacular Scriptures with grave\r\nsuspicion, but that they did not go the length of condemning entirely\r\ntheir possession by persons esteemed trustworthy, whether clergy, monks,\r\nnuns, or distinguished laymen.\r\n\r\nYet we have in the later Middle Ages, ever since Wiclif produced his\r\nEnglish version, the gradual publication of the Scriptures in the\r\nvernaculars of Europe. This was specially so in Germany; and when the\r\ninvention of printing had made the diffusion of literature easy, it is\r\nnoteworthy that the earliest presses in Germany printed many more books\r\nfor family and private devotion, many more _Plenaria_, and many more\r\neditions of the Bible than of the classics. Twenty-two editions of the\r\nPsalter in German appeared before 1509, and twenty-five of the Gospels and\r\nEpistles before 1518. No less than fourteen (some say seventeen) versions\r\nof the whole Bible were printed in High-German and three in Low-German\r\nduring the last decades of the fifteenth and the earlier decades of the\r\nsixteenth century—all translations from the Vulgate. The first was issued\r\nby John Metzel in Strassburg in 1466. Then followed another Strassburg\r\nedition in 1470, two Augsburg editions in 1473, one in the Swiss dialect\r\nin 1474, two in Augsburg in 1477, one in Augsburg in 1480, one in Nürnberg\r\nin 1483, one in Strassburg in 1485, and editions in Augsburg in 1487,\r\n1490, 1507, and 1518. A careful comparison of these printed vernacular\r\nBibles proves that the earlier editions were independent productions; but\r\nas edition succeeded edition the text became gradually assimilated until\r\nthere came into existence a German Vulgate, which was used\r\nindiscriminately by those who adhered to the mediæval Church and those who\r\nwere dissenters from it. These German versions were largely, but by no\r\nmeans completely, displaced by Luther’s translation. The Anabaptists, for\r\nexample, retained this German Vulgate long after the publication of\r\nLuther’s version, and these pre-Reformation German Bibles were to be found\r\nin use almost two hundred years after the Reformation.(100)\r\n\r\nWhence sprang the demand for these vernacular versions of the Holy\r\nScriptures? That the leaders of the mediæval Church viewed their existence\r\nwith alarm is evident from the proclamation of the Primate of Germany,\r\nBerthold of Mainz, issued in 1486, ordering a censorship of books with\r\nspecial reference to vernacular translations of the Scriptures.(101) On\r\nthe other hand, there is no evidence that these versions were either\r\nwholly or in great part the work of enemies of the mediæval Church. The\r\nmediæval _Brethren_, as they called themselves (Waldenses, Picards,\r\nWiclifites, Hussites, etc., were names given to them very indiscriminately\r\nby the ecclesiastical authorities), had translations of the Scriptures\r\nboth in the Romance and in the Teutonic languages as early as the close of\r\nthe thirteenth century. The records of inquisitors and of councils prove\r\nit. But there is no evidence to connect any of these German versions,\r\nsave, perhaps, one at Augsburg, and that issued by the Koburgers in\r\nNürnberg, with these earlier translations. The growing spread of education\r\nin the fifteenth century, and, above all, the growth of a\r\nnon-ecclesiastical piety which claimed to examine and to judge for itself,\r\ndemanded and received these numerous versions of the Holy Scriptures in\r\nthe vulgar tongue.(102) The “common man” had the word of God in his hands,\r\ncould read, meditate, and judge for himself. The effect of the presence of\r\nthese vernacular Scriptures is apt to be exaggerated.(103) The Humanist,\r\nConrad Celtes, might threaten the priests that the Bible would soon be\r\nseen in every village tavern; but we know that in these days of early\r\nprinting a complete Bible must have been too expensive to be purchased by\r\na poor man. Still he could get the Gospels or the Epistles, or the\r\nPsalter; and there is evidence, apart from the number of editions, that\r\nthe people were buying and were studying the Scriptures. Preachers were\r\nexhorted to give the meaning of the passages of Scripture read in Church\r\nto prevent the people being confused by the different ways in which the\r\ntext was translated in the Bibles in their possession. Stories were told\r\nof peasants, like Hans Werner, who worsted their parish priests in\r\narguments drawn from Scripture. The ecclesiastical authorities were\r\nundoubtedly anxious, and their anxiety was shared by many who desired a\r\nreformation in life and manners, but dreaded any revolutionary movement.\r\nIt was right that the children should be fed with the Bread of Life, but\r\nMother Church ought to keep the bread-knife in her hands lest the children\r\ncut their fingers. Some publishers of the translations inserted prefaces\r\nsaying that the contents of the volumes should be understood in the way\r\ntaught by the Church, as was done in the _Book of the Gospels_, published\r\nat Basel in 1514. But in spite of all a lay religion had come into being,\r\nand laymen were beginning to think for themselves in matters where\r\necclesiastics had hitherto been considered the sole judges.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 7. The “Brethren.”\r\n\r\n\r\nThere was another type of religious life and pious association which\r\nexisted, and which seems in one form or other to have exercised a great\r\ninfluence among the better class of artisans, and more especially among\r\nthe printers of Augsburg, Nürnberg, and Strassburg.\r\n\r\nIt is probable that this type of piety had at least three roots.\r\n\r\n(_a_) We can trace as far back as the closing years of the thirteenth\r\ncentury, in many parts of Germany, the existence of nonconformists who, on\r\nthe testimony of inquisitors, lived pious lives, acted righteously towards\r\ntheir neighbours, and believed in all the articles of the Christian faith,\r\nbut repudiated the Roman Church and the clergy. Their persecutors gave\r\nthem a high character. “The heretics are known by their walk and\r\nconversation: they live quietly and modestly; they have no pride in dress;\r\ntheir learned men are tailors and weavers; they do not heap up riches, but\r\nare content with what is necessary; they live chastely; they are temperate\r\nin eating and drinking; they never go to taverns, nor to public dances,\r\nnor to any such vanities; they refrain from all foul language, from\r\nbackbiting, from thoughtless speech, from lying and from swearing.” The\r\nlist of objections which they had to usages of the mediæval Church are\r\nthose which would occur to any evangelical Protestant of this century.\r\nThey professed a simple evangelical creed; they offered a passive\r\nresistance to the hierarchical and priestly pretensions of the clergy;\r\nthey were careful to educate their children in schools which they\r\nsupported; they had vernacular translations of the Scriptures, and\r\ncommitted large portions to memory; they conducted their religious service\r\nin the vernacular, and it was one of the accusations made against them\r\nthat they alleged that the word of God was as profitable when read in the\r\nvernacular as when studied in Latin. It is also interesting to know that\r\nthey were accused of visiting the leper-houses to pray with the inmates,\r\nand that in some towns they had schools for the leper children.(104) They\r\ncalled themselves the _Brethren_. The societies of the _Brethren_ had\r\nnever died out. During the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries they were\r\ncontinually subject to local and somewhat spasmodic persecutions, when the\r\necclesiastical could secure the aid of the secular authorities to their\r\nschemes of repression, which was not always possible. They were strongly\r\nrepresented among the artisans in the great cities, and there are\r\ninstances when the civic authorities gave them one of the churches of the\r\ntowns for their services. The liability to intermittent persecution led to\r\nan organisation whereby the _Brethren_, who were for the time being living\r\nin peace, made arrangements to receive and support those who were able to\r\nescape from any district where the persecution raged. These societies were\r\nin correspondence with their brethren all over Europe, and were never so\r\nactive as during the last decades of the fifteenth and the first quarter\r\nof the sixteenth century.\r\n\r\n(_b_) As early as the times of Meister Eckhart (d. 1327), of his disciples\r\nTauler (d. 1361) and Suso (d 1366), of the mysterious “Friend of God in\r\nthe Oberland” and his associates (among them the Strassburg merchant\r\nRulman Merswin (d. 1382)), and of the Brussels curate John Ruysbroeck (d.\r\n1381), the leaders of the mediæval Mystics had been accustomed to gather\r\ntheir followers together into praying circles; and the custom was\r\nperpetuated long after their departure. How these pious associations\r\ncontinued to exist in the half century before the Reformation, and what\r\nforms their organisation took, it seems impossible to say with any\r\naccuracy. The school system of the _Brethren __ of the Common Lot_, which\r\nalways had an intimate connection with the _Gottesfreunde_, in all\r\nprobability served to spread the praying circles which had come down from\r\nthe earlier Mystics. It seems to have been a custom among these _Brethren\r\nof the Common Lot_ to invite their neighbours to meet in their schoolrooms\r\nor in a hall to listen to religious discourses. There they read and\r\nexpounded the New Testament in the vernacular. They also read extracts\r\nfrom books written to convey popular religious instruction. They\r\nquestioned their audience to find out how far their hearers understood\r\ntheir teaching, and endeavoured by question and answer to discover and\r\nsolve religious difficulties. These schools and teachers had extended all\r\nover Germany by the close of the fifteenth century, and their effect in\r\nquickening and keeping alive personal religion must have been great.\r\n\r\n(_c_) Then, altogether apart from the social and semi-political propaganda\r\nof the Hussites, there is evidence that ever since the circulation of the\r\nencyclic letter addressed by the Taborites in November 1431 to all\r\nChristians in all lands, and more especially since the foundation of the\r\n_Unitas Fratrum_ in 1452, there had been constant communication between\r\nBohemia and the scattered bodies of evangelical dissenters throughout\r\nGermany. Probably historians have credited the Hussites with more than\r\ntheir due influence over their German sympathisers. The latter had arrived\r\nat the conclusion that tithes ought to be looked upon as free-will\r\nofferings, that the cup should be given to the laity, etc., long before\r\nthe movements under the leadership of Wiclif and of Huss. But the\r\nknowledge that they had sympathisers and brethren beyond their own land\r\nmust have been a source of strength to the German nonconformists.\r\n\r\nOur knowledge of the times is still too obscure to warrant us in making\r\nvery definite statements about the proportionate effect of these three\r\nreligious sources of influence on the small communities of _Brethren_ or\r\nevangelical dissenters from the mediæval Church which maintained a\r\nprecarious existence at the close of the Middle Ages. There is one curious\r\nfact, however, which shows that there must have been an intimate\r\nconnection between the Waldenses of Savoy and France, the _Brethren_ of\r\nGermany, and the _Unitas Fratrum_ of Bohemia. They all used the same\r\ncatechism for the instruction of their children in divine things. So far\r\nas can be ascertained, this small catechism was first printed in 1498, and\r\neditions can be traced down to 1530. It exists in French, Italian, German,\r\nand Bohemian. The inspiration drawn from the earlier Mystics and\r\n_Gottesfreunde_ is shown by the books circulated by the _Brethren_. They\r\nmade great use of the newly discovered art of printing to spread abroad\r\nsmall mystical writings on personal religion, and translations of portions\r\nof the Holy Scriptures. They printed and circulated books which had been\r\nused in manuscript among the Mystics of the fourteenth century, such as\r\nthe celebrated _Masterbook_, single sermons by Tauler, Prayers and Rules\r\nfor holy living extracted from his writings, as well as short tracts taken\r\nfrom the later Mystics, like the _Explanation of the Ten Commandments_. It\r\nis also probable that some of the many translations of the whole or\r\nportions of the Bible which were in circulation in Germany before the days\r\nof Luther came from these praying circles. The celebrated firm of Nürnberg\r\nprinters, the Koburgers, who published so many Bibles, were the German\r\nprinters of the little catechism used by the _Brethren_; and, as has been\r\nsaid, the Anabaptists, who were the successors of these associations, did\r\nnot use Luther’s version, but a much older one which had come down to them\r\nfrom their ancestors.\r\n\r\nThe members of these praying circles welcomed the Lutheran Reformation\r\nwhen it came, but they can scarcely be said to have belonged to it. Luther\r\nhas confessed how much he owed to one of their publications, _Die deutsche\r\nTheologie_; and what helped him must have benefited others. The\r\norganisation of a Lutheran Church, based on civil divisions of the Empire,\r\ngave the signal for a thorough reorganisation of the members of these old\r\nassociations who refused to have anything to do with a State Church. They\r\nformed the best side of the very mixed and very much misunderstood\r\nmovement which later was called Anabaptism, and thus remained outside of\r\nthe two great divisions into which the Church of the Reformation\r\nseparated. This religious type existed and showed itself more especially\r\namong the artisans in the larger towns of Germany.\r\n\r\nIt must not be supposed that these four classes of religious sentiment\r\nwhich have been found existing during the later decades of the fifteenth\r\nand the early decades of the sixteenth centuries can always be clearly\r\ndistinguished from each other. Religious types cannot be kept distinct,\r\nbut continually blend with each other in the most unexpected way. Humanism\r\nand Anabaptism seem as far apart as they can possibly be; yet some of the\r\nmost noted Anabaptist leaders were distinguished members of the Erasmus\r\ncircle at Basel. Humanism and delicate clinging to the simple faith of\r\nchildhood blended in the exquisite character of Melanchthon. Luther,\r\n_after_ his stern wrestle with self-righteousness in the convent at\r\nErfurt, believed that, had his parents been dead, he could have delivered\r\ntheir souls from purgatory by his visits to the shrines of the saints at\r\nRome. The boy Mecum (Myconius) retained only so much of his father’s\r\nteaching about the _free_ Grace of God that he believed an Indulgence from\r\nTetzel would benefit him if he could obtain it without paying for it.\r\nThere is everywhere and at all times a blending of separate types of\r\nreligious faith, until a notable crisis brings men suddenly face to face\r\nwith the necessity of a choice. Such a crisis occurred during the period\r\nwe call the Reformation, with the result that the leaders in that great\r\nreligious revival found that the truest theology after all was what had\r\nexpressed itself in hymns and prayers, in revivalist sermons and in\r\nfireside teaching, and that they felt it to be their duty as theologians\r\nto give articulate dogmatic expression to what their fathers had been\r\ncontent to find inarticulately in the devotional rather than in the\r\nintellectual sphere of the mediæval religious life.\r\n\r\nSuch was the religious atmosphere into which Luther was born, and which he\r\nbreathed from his earliest days. Every element seems to have shared in\r\ncreating and shaping his religious history, and had similar effects\r\ndoubtless on his most distinguished and sympathetic followers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter VI. Humanism And Reformation.(105)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 1. Savonarola.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen the Italian Humanism seemed about to become a mere revival of ancient\r\nPaganism, with its accompaniments of a cynical sensualism on the one hand,\r\nand the blindest trust in the occult sciences on the other, a great\r\npreacher arose in Florence who recalled men to Christianity and to\r\nChristian virtue.\r\n\r\nGirolamo Savonarola was an Italian, a countryman of Giaocchino di Fiore,\r\nof Arnold of Brescia, of Francis of Assisi, of John of Parma, and, like\r\nthem, he believed himself to be favoured with visions apocalyptic and\r\nother. He belonged to a land over which, all down through the Middle Ages,\r\nhad swept popular religious revivals, sudden, consuming, and transient as\r\nprairie fires. When a boy, he had quivered at seeing the pain in the world\r\naround him; he had shuddered as he passed the great grim palaces of the\r\nItalian despots, where the banqueting hall was separated from the dungeon\r\nby a floor so thin that the groans of the prisoners mingled with the\r\ntinkle of the silver dishes and the wanton conversation of the guests. He\r\nhad been destined by his family for the medical profession, and the lad\r\nwas set to master the writings of Thomas Aquinas and the Arabian\r\ncommentaries on Aristotle—the gateway in those days to a knowledge of the\r\nart of healing. The _Summa_ of the great Schoolman entranced him, and\r\ninsensibly drew him towards theology; but outwardly he did not rebel\r\nagainst the lot in life marked out for him. A glimpse of a quiet\r\nresting-place in this world of pain and evil had come to him, but it\r\nvanished, swallowed up in the universal gloom, when Roberto Strozzi\r\nrefused to permit him to marry his daughter Laodamia. There remained only\r\nrest on God, study of His word, and such slight solace as music and\r\nsonnet-writing could bring. His devotion to Thomas Aquinas impelled him to\r\nseek within a Dominican convent that refuge which he passionately yearned\r\nfor, from a corrupt world and a corrupt Church. There he remained buried\r\nfor long years, reading and re-reading the Scriptures, poring over the\r\n_Summa_, drinking in the New Learning, almost unconsciously creating for\r\nhimself a philosophy which blended the teachings of Aquinas with the\r\nNeo-Platonism of Marsiglio Ficino and of the Academy, and planning how he\r\ncould best represent the doctrines of the Christian religion in harmony\r\nwith the natural reason of man.\r\n\r\nWhen at last he became a great preacher, able to sway heart and\r\nconscience, it should not be forgotten that he was mediæval to the core.\r\nHis doctrinal teaching was based firmly on the theology of Thomas Aquinas.\r\nHis intellectual conception of faith, his strong belief in the divine\r\npredestination and his way of expressing it, his view of Scripture as\r\npossessing manifold meanings, were all defined for him by the great\r\nDominican Schoolman. He held strongly the mediæval idea that the Church\r\nwas an external political unity, ruled by the Bishop of Rome, to whom\r\nevery human soul must be subject, and whom everyone must obey save only\r\nwhen commands were issued contrary to a plain statement of the evangelical\r\nlaw. He expounded the fulness of and the slight limitations to the\r\nauthority of the Pope exactly as Thomas and the great Schoolmen of the\r\nthirteenth century had done, though in terms very different from the\r\ncanonists of the Roman Curia at the close of the Middle Ages. Even his\r\nappreciation of the Neo-Platonist side of Humanism could be traced back to\r\nmediæval authorities; for at all times the writings of the\r\npseudo-Dionysius had been a source of inspiration to the greater\r\nSchoolmen.\r\n\r\nHis scholarship brought him into relation with the Humanist leaders in\r\nFlorence, the earnest tone of his teaching and the saintliness of his\r\ncharacter attracted them, his deep personal piety made them feel that he\r\npossessed something which they lacked; while no Neo-Platonist could be\r\nrepelled by his claim to be the recipient of visions from on high.\r\n\r\nThe celebrated Humanists of Florence became the disciples of the great\r\npreacher. Marsiglio Ficino himself, the head of the Florentine Academy,\r\nwho kept one lamp burning before the bust of Plato and another before an\r\nimage of the Virgin, was for a time completely under his spell. Young\r\nGiovanni Pico della Mirandola’s whole inner life was changed through his\r\nconversations with the Prior of San Marco. He reformed his earlier\r\ncareless habits. He burnt five books of wanton love-songs which he had\r\ncomposed before his conversion.(106) He prayed daily at fixed hours, and\r\nhe wrote earnestly to his nephew on the importance of prayer for a godly\r\nlife:\r\n\r\n\r\n    “ ‘I stir thee not,’ he says, ‘to that prayer that standeth in\r\n    many words, but to that prayer which in the secret chamber of the\r\n    mind, in the privy-closet of the soul, with every affect speaketh\r\n    to God; which in the most lightsome darkness of contemplation not\r\n    only presenteth the mind to the Father, but also uniteth it with\r\n    Him by unspeakable ways which only they know who have assayed. Nor\r\n    care I how long or how short thy prayer be; but how effectual, how\r\n    ardent, and rather interrupted and broken between with sighs, than\r\n    drawn on length with a number of words.... Let no day pass but\r\n    thou once at the leastwise present thyself to God in prayer....\r\n    What thou shalt in thy prayer ask of God, both the Holy Spirit\r\n    which prayeth for us and also thine own necessity shall every hour\r\n    put in thy mind.’ ”(107)\r\n\r\n\r\nHe studied the writings of Thomas Aquinas, which contained the favourite\r\ntheology of Savonarola, and spoke of the great Schoolman as a “pillar of\r\ntruth.”(108) He handed over the third part of his estates to his nephew,\r\nand lived plainly on what remained, that he might give largely in\r\ncharity.(109) He made Savonarola his almoner, who on his behalf gave alms\r\nto destitute people and marriage portions to poor maidens.(110) He had\r\nfrequent thoughts of entering the Dominican Order, and\r\n\r\n\r\n    “On a time as he walked with his nephew, John Francis, in a garden\r\n    at Ferrara, talking of the love of Christ, he broke out with these\r\n    words: ‘Nephew,’ said he, ‘this will I show thee; I warn thee keep\r\n    it secret; the substance I have left after certain books of mine\r\n    are finished, I intend to give out to poor folk, and, fencing\r\n    myself with the crucifix, barefoot, walking about the world, in\r\n    every town and castle I purpose to preach Christ.’ ”(111)\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is also recorded that he made a practice of scourging himself;\r\nespecially “on those days which represent unto us the Passion and Death\r\nthat Christ suffered for our sake, he beat and scourged his own flesh in\r\nremembrance of that great benefit, and for cleansing his old\r\noffences.”(112) But above all things he devoted himself to a diligent\r\nstudy of the Holy Scriptures, and commended the practice to his nephew:\r\n\r\n\r\n    “ ‘Thou mayest do nothing more pleasing to God, nothing more\r\n    profitable to thyself, than if thine hand cease not day and night\r\n    to turn and read the volumes of Holy Scripture. There lieth\r\n    privily in them a certain heavenly strength, quick and effectual,\r\n    which, with a marvellous power, transformeth and changeth the\r\n    readers’ mind into the love of God, if they be clean and lowly\r\n    entreated.’ ”(113)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe great Platonist forsook Plato for St. Paul, whom he called the\r\n“glorious Apostle.”(114) When he died he left his lands to one of the\r\nhospitals in Florence, and desired to be buried in the hood of the\r\nDominican monks and within the Convent of San Marco.\r\n\r\nAnother distinguished member of the Florentine Academy, Angelo Poliziano,\r\nwas also one of Savonarola’s converts. We find him exchanging confidences\r\nwith Pico, both declaring that love and not knowledge is the faculty by\r\nwhich we learn to know God:\r\n\r\n\r\n    “ ‘But now behold, my well-beloved Angelo,’ writes Pico, ‘what\r\n    madness holdeth us. Love God (while we be in this body) we rather\r\n    may, than either know Him, or by speech utter Him. In loving Him\r\n    also we more profit ourselves; we labour less and serve Him more.\r\n    And yet had we rather always by knowledge never find that thing we\r\n    seek, than by love possess that thing which also without love were\r\n    in vain found.’ ”(115)\r\n\r\n\r\nPoliziano, like Pico, had at one time some thoughts of joining the\r\nDominican Order. He too was buried at his own request in the cowl of the\r\nDominican monk in the Convent of San Marco.\r\n\r\nLorenzo de Medici, who during his life had made many attempts to win the\r\nsupport of Savonarola, and had always been repulsed, could not die without\r\nentreating the great preacher to visit him on his deathbed and grant him\r\nabsolution.\r\n\r\nItalian Humanism was for the moment won over to Christianity by the Prior\r\nof San Marco. Had the poets and the scholars, the politicians and the\r\necclesiastics, the State and the Church, not been so hopelessly corrupt,\r\nthere might have been a great renovation of mankind, under the leadership\r\nof men who had no desire to break the political unity of the mediæval\r\nChurch. For it can scarcely be too strongly insisted that Savonarola was\r\nno Reformation leader in the more limited sense of the phrase. The\r\nmovement he headed has much more affinity with the crude revival of\r\nreligion in Germany in the end of the fifteenth century, than with the\r\nReformation itself; and the aim of the reorganisation of the Tuscan\r\ncongregation of the Dominicans under Savonarola has an almost exact\r\nparallel in the creation of the congregation of the Augustinian Eremites\r\nunder Andreas Proles and Johann Staupitz. The whole Italian movement, as\r\nmight be expected, was conducted by men of greater intelligence and\r\nrefinement. It had therefore less sympathy than the German with\r\npilgrimages, relics, the niceties of ceremonial worship, and the cult of\r\nthe vulgarly miraculous; but it was not the less mediæval on these\r\naccounts. It was the death rather than the life and lifework of Savonarola\r\nthat was destined to have direct effect on the Reformation soon to come\r\nbeyond the Alps; for his martyrdom was a crowning evidence of the\r\nimpossibility of reforming the Church of the Middle Ages apart from the\r\nshock of a great convulsion. “Luther himself,” says Professor Villari,\r\n“could scarcely have been so successful in inaugurating his Reform, had\r\nnot the sacrifice of Savonarola given a final proof that it was hopeless\r\nto hope in the purification of Rome.”(116)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 2. John Colet.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile Savonarola was at the height of his influence in Florence, there\r\nchanced to be in Italy a young Englishman, John Colet, son of a wealthy\r\nLondon merchant who had been several times Lord Mayor. He had gone there,\r\nwe may presume, like his countrymen Grocyn and Linacre, to make himself\r\nacquainted with the New Learning at its fountainhead. There is no proof\r\nthat he went to Florence or ever saw the great Italian preacher; but no\r\nstranger could have visited Northern Italy in 1495 without hearing much of\r\nhim and of his work. Colet’s whole future life in England bears evidence\r\nthat he did receive a new impulse while he was in Italy, and that of such\r\na kind as could have come only from Savonarola. What Erasmus tells us of\r\nhis sojourn there amply confirms this. Colet gave himself up to the study\r\nof the Holy Scriptures; he read carefully those theologians of the ancient\r\nChurch specially acceptable to the Neo-Platonist Christian Humanists; he\r\nstudied the pseudo-Dionysius, Origen, and Jerome. What is more remarkable\r\nstill in a foreign Humanist come to study in Italy, he read diligently\r\nsuch English classics as he could find in order to prepare himself for the\r\nwork of preaching when he returned to England. The words of Erasmus imply\r\nthat the impulse to do all this came to him when he was in Italy, and\r\nthere was no one to impart it to him but the great Florentine.\r\n\r\nWhen Colet returned to England in 1496, he began to lecture at Oxford on\r\nthe Epistles of St. Paul. His method of exposition, familiar enough after\r\nCalvin had introduced it into the Reformed Church, was then absolutely\r\nnew, and proves that he was an original and independent thinker. His aim\r\nwas to find out the _personal_ message which the writer (St. Paul) had\r\nsent to the Christians at Rome; and this led him to seek for every trace\r\nwhich revealed the personality of the Apostle to the Gentiles. It was\r\nequally imperative to know what were the surroundings of the men to whom\r\nthe Epistle was addressed, and Colet studied Suetonius to find some\r\nindications of the environment of the Roman Christians. He had thus\r\ncompletely freed himself from the Scholastic habit of using the Scriptures\r\nas a mere collection of isolated texts to be employed in proving doctrines\r\nor moral rules constructed or imposed by the Church, and it is therefore\r\nnot surprising to find that he never lards his expositions with quotations\r\nfrom the Fathers. It is a still greater proof of his daring that he set\r\naside the allegorising methods of the Schoolmen,—methods abundantly used\r\nby Savonarola,—and that he did so in spite of his devotion to the writings\r\nof the pseudo-Dionysius. He was the first to apply the critical methods of\r\nthe New Learning to discover the exact meaning of the books of the Holy\r\nScriptures. His treatment of the Scriptures shows that however he may have\r\nbeen influenced by Savonarola and by the Christian Humanists of Italy, he\r\nhad advanced far beyond them, and had seen, what no mediæval theologian\r\nhead been able to perceive, that the Bible is a personal and not a\r\ndogmatic revelation. They were mediæval: he belongs to the Reformation\r\ncircle of thinkers. Luther, Calvin, and Colet, whatever else separates\r\nthem, have this one deeply important thought in common. Further, Colet\r\ndiscarded the mediæval conception of a mechanical inspiration of the text\r\nof Scripture, in this also agreeing with Luther and Calvin. The\r\ninspiration of the Holy Scriptures was something mysterious to him. “The\r\nSpirit seemed to him by reason of its majesty to have a peculiar method of\r\nits own, singularly, absolutely free, blowing where it lists, making\r\nprophets of whom it will, yet so that the spirit of the prophets is\r\nsubject to the prophets.”(117)\r\n\r\nColet saw clearly, and denounced the abounding evils which were ruining\r\nthe Church of his day. The Convocation of the English Church never\r\nlistened to a bolder sermon than that preached to them by the Dean of St.\r\nPaul’s in 1512—the same year that Luther addressed an assembly of clergy\r\nat Leitzkau. The two addresses should be compared. The same fundamental\r\nthought is contained in both—that every true reformation must begin with\r\nthe individual man. Colet declared that reform must begin with the\r\nbishops, and that once begun it would spread to the clergy and thence to\r\nthe laity; “for the body follows the soul; and as are the rulers in a\r\nState, such will the people be.” He urged that what was wanted was the\r\nenforcement of ecclesiastical laws which were already in existence.\r\nIgnorant and wicked men were admitted to holy orders, and there were laws\r\nprohibiting this. Simony was creeping “like a cancer through the minds of\r\npriests, so that most are not ashamed in these days to get for themselves\r\ngreat dignities by petitions and suits at court, rewards and promises”;\r\nand yet strict laws against the evil were in existence. He proceeded to\r\nenumerate the other flagrant abuses—the non-residence of clergy, the\r\nworldly pursuits and indulgences of the clergy; the scandals and vices of\r\nthe ecclesiastical law-courts; the infrequency of provincial councils to\r\ndiscuss and remedy existing evils; the wasting of the patrimony of the\r\nChurch on sumptuous buildings, on banquets, on enriching kinsfolk, or on\r\nkeeping hounds. The Church had laws against all these abuses, but they\r\nwere not enforced, and could not be until the bishops amended their ways.\r\nHis scheme of reform was to put in operation the existing regulations of\r\nCanon Law. “The diseases which are now in the Church were the same in\r\nformer ages, and there is no evil for which the holy fathers did not\r\nprovide excellent remedies; there are no crimes in prohibition of which\r\nthere are not laws in the body of Canon Law.” Such was his definite idea\r\nof reform in this famous Convocation sermon.\r\n\r\nBut he had wider views. He desired the diffusion of a sound Christian\r\neducation, and did the best that could be done by one man to promote it,\r\nby spending his private fortune in founding St. Paul’s school, which he\r\ncharacteristically left in charge of a body of laymen. He longed to see a\r\nwidespread preaching in the vernacular, and believed that the bishops\r\nshould show an example in this clerical duty. It is probable that he\r\nwished the whole service to be in the vernacular, for it was made a charge\r\nagainst him that he taught his congregation to repeat the Lord’s Prayer in\r\nEnglish. Besides, he had clearly grasped the thought, too often forgotten\r\nby theologians of all schools, that the spiritual facts and forces which\r\nlie at the roots of the Christian life are one thing, and the intellectual\r\nconceptions which men make to explain these facts and forces are another,\r\nand a much less important thing; that men are able to be Christians and to\r\nlive the Christian life because of the former and not because of the\r\nlatter. He saw that, while dogma has its place, it is at best the alliance\r\nof an immortal with a mortal, the union between that which is unchangeably\r\ndivine and the fashions of human thought which change from one age to\r\nanother. For this reason he thought little of the Scholastic Theology of\r\nhis days, with its forty-three propositions about the nature of God and\r\nits forty-five about the nature of man before and after the Fall, each of\r\nwhich had to be assented to at the risk of a charge of heresy. “Why do you\r\nextol to me such a man as Aquinas? If he had not been so very arrogant,\r\nindeed, he would not surely so rashly and proudly have taken upon himself\r\nto define all things. And unless his spirit had been somewhat worldly, he\r\nwould not surely have corrupted the whole teaching of Christ by mixing it\r\nwith his profane philosophy.” The Scholastic Theology might have been\r\nscientific in the thirteenth century, but the “scientific” is the human\r\nand changing element in dogma, and the old theology had become clearly\r\nunscientific in the sixteenth. Therefore he was accustomed to advise young\r\ntheological students to keep to the Bible and the Apostles’ Creed, and let\r\ndivines, if they liked, dispute about the rest; and he taught Erasmus to\r\nlook askance at Luther’s reconstruction of the Augustinian theology.\r\n\r\nBut no thinking man, however he may flout at philosophy and dogma, can do\r\nwithout either; and Colet was no exception to the general rule. He has\r\nplaced on record his detestation of Aquinas and his dislike of Augustine,\r\nand we may perhaps see in this a lack of sympathy with a prominent\r\ncharacteristic of the theology of Latin Christianity from Tertullian to\r\nAquinas and Occam, to say nothing of developments since the Reformation.\r\nThe great men who built up the Western Church were almost all trained\r\nRoman lawyers. Tertullian, Cyprian, Augustine, Gregory the Great (whose\r\nwritings form the bridge between the Latin Fathers and the Schoolmen) were\r\nall men whose early training had been that of a Roman lawyer,—a training\r\nwhich moulded and shaped all their thinking, whether theological or\r\necclesiastical. They instinctively regarded all questions as a great Roman\r\nlawyer would. They had the lawyer’s craving for exact definitions. They\r\nhad the lawyer’s idea that the primary duty laid upon them was to enforce\r\nobedience to authority, whether that authority expressed itself in\r\nexternal institutions or in the precise definitions of the correct ways of\r\nthinking about spiritual truths. No branch of Western Christendom has been\r\nable to free itself from the spell cast upon it by these Roman lawyers of\r\nthe early centuries of the Christian Church.\r\n\r\nIf the ideas of Christian Roman lawyers, filtering slowly down through the\r\ncenturies, had made the Bishops of Rome dream that they were the\r\nsuccessors of Augustus, at once Emperor and Pontifex Maximus, master of\r\nthe bodies and of the souls of mankind, they had also inspired the\r\ntheologians of the Mediæval Church with the conception of an intellectual\r\nimperialism, where a system of Christian thought, expressed with legal\r\nprecision, could bind into a comprehensive unity the active intelligence\r\nof mankind. Dogmas thus expressed can become the instruments of a tyranny\r\nmuch more penetrating than that of an institution, and so Colet found. In\r\nhis revolt he turned from the Latins to the Greeks, and to that thinker\r\nwho was furthest removed from the legal precision of statement which was\r\ncharacteristic of Western theology.\r\n\r\nIt is probable that his intercourse with the Christian Humanists of Italy,\r\nand his introduction to Platonists and to Neo-Platonism, made him turn to\r\nthe writings of the pseudo-Dionysius; but it is certain that he believed\r\nat first that the author of these quaint mystical tracts was the Dionysius\r\nwho was one of the converts of St. Paul at Athens, and that these writings\r\nembodied much of the teaching of the Apostle to the Gentiles, and took the\r\nreader back to the first generation of the Christian Church. After he had\r\nlearned from Grocyn that the author of the _Celestial_ and the\r\n_Terrestrial Hierarchies_ could not have been the convert of St. Paul, and\r\nthat the writings could not be earlier than the sixth century, he still\r\nregarded them as evidence of the way in which a Christian philosopher\r\ncould express the thoughts which were current in Christianity one thousand\r\nyears before Colet’s time. The writings could be used as a touchstone to\r\ntest usages and opinions prevalent at the close of the Middle Ages, when\r\nmen were still subject to the domination of the Scholastic Theology, and\r\nas justification for rejecting them.\r\n\r\nThey taught him two things which he was very willing to learn: that the\r\nhuman mind, however it may be able to feel after God, can never comprehend\r\nHim, nor imprison His character and attributes in propositions—stereotyped\r\naspects of thoughts—which can be fitted into syllogisms; and that such\r\nthings as hierarchy and sacraments are to be prized not because they are\r\nin themselves the active sources and centres of mysterious powers, but\r\nbecause they faintly symbolise the spiritual forces by which God works for\r\nthe salvation of His people. Colet applied to the study of the writings of\r\nthe pseudo-Dionysius a mind saturated with simple Christian truth gained\r\nfrom a study of the Holy Scriptures, and especially of the Epistles of St.\r\nPaul; and the very luxuriance of imagination and bewildering confusion of\r\nsymbolism in these writings, their elusiveness as opposed to the precision\r\nof Thomas Aquinas or of John Duns the Scot, enabled him the more easily to\r\nfind in them the germs of his own more definite opinions.\r\n\r\nWhen one studies the abstracts of the _Hierarchies_(118)—which Colet wrote\r\nout from memory—with the actual text of the books themselves, it is\r\nscarcely surprising to find how much there is of Colet and how little of\r\nDionysius.(119)\r\n\r\nWhile it is impossible to say how far Colet, and the Christian Humanists\r\nwho agreed with him, would have welcomed the principles of a Reformation\r\nyet to come, it can be affirmed that he held the same views on two very\r\nimportant points. He did not believe in a priesthood in the mediæval nor\r\nin the modern Roman sense of the word, and his theory of the efficacy and\r\nmeaning of the sacraments of the Christian Church was essentially\r\nProtestant.\r\n\r\nAccording to Colet, there was no such thing as a mediatorial priesthood\r\nwhose essential function it was to approach God on men’s behalf and\r\npresent their offerings to Him. The duty of the Christian priesthood was\r\nministerial; it was to declare the love and mercy of God to their\r\nfellow-men, and to strive for the purification, illumination, and\r\nsalvation of mankind by constant preaching of the truth and diffusion of\r\ngospel light, even as Christ strove. He did not believe that priests had\r\nreceived from God the power of absolving from sins. “It must be needfully\r\nremarked,” he says, “lest bishops be presumptuous, that it is not the part\r\nof men to loose the bonds of sins; nor does the power belong to them of\r\nloosing or binding anything,”—the truth Luther set forth in his Theses\r\nagainst Indulgences.\r\n\r\nColet is even more decided in his repudiation of the sacramental theories\r\nof the mediæval Church. The Eucharist is not a sacrifice, but a\r\ncommemoration of the death of our Lord, and a symbol of the union and\r\ncommunion which believers have with Him, and with their fellow-men through\r\nHim. Baptism is a ceremony which symbolises the believer’s change of heart\r\nand his vow of service to his Master, and signifies “the more excellent\r\nbaptism of the inner man”; and the duty of sponsors is to train children\r\nin the knowledge and fear of God.(120)\r\n\r\nWe are told that the Lollards delighted in Colet’s preaching; that they\r\nadvised each other to go to hear him; and that attendance at the Dean’s\r\nsermons was actually made a charge against them. Colet was no Lollard\r\nhimself; indeed, he seems to have once sat among ecclesiastical judges who\r\ncondemned Lollards to death;(121) but the preacher who taught that tithes\r\nwere voluntary offerings, who denounced the evil lives of the monks and\r\nthe secular clergy; who hated war, and did not scruple to say so; whose\r\nsermons were full of simple Bible instruction, must have recalled many\r\nmemories of the old Lollard doctrines. For Lollardy had never died out in\r\nEngland: it was active in Colet’s days, leavening the country for the\r\nReformation which was to come.\r\n\r\nNor should it be forgotten, in measuring the influence of Colet on the\r\ncoming Reformation, that Latimer was a friend of his, that William Tyndale\r\nwas one of his favourite pupils, and that he persuaded Erasmus to turn\r\nfrom purely classical studies to edit the New Testament and the early\r\nChristian Fathers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 3. Erasmus.\r\n\r\n\r\nErasmus, as has often been said, was a “man by himself;” yet he may be\r\nregarded as representing one, and perhaps the most frequent, type of\r\nChristian Humanism. His character will always be matter of controversy;\r\nand his motives may, without unfairness, be represented in an unfavourable\r\nlight,—a “great scholar but a petty-minded man,” is a verdict for which\r\nthere is abundant evidence. Such was the final judgment of his\r\ncontemporaries, mainly because he refused to take a definite side in the\r\nage when the greatest controversy which has convulsed Western Europe since\r\nthe downfall of the old Empire seemed to call on every man to range\r\nhimself with one party or other. Our modern judgment must rest on a\r\ndifferent basis. In calmer days, when the din of battle has almost died\r\naway, it is possible to recognise that to refuse to be a partisan _may_\r\nindicate greatness instead of littleness of soul, a keener vision, and a\r\ncalmer courage. We cannot judge the man as hastily as his contemporaries\r\ndid. Still there is evidence enough and to spare to back their verdict.\r\nEvery biographer has admitted that it is hopeless to look for truth in his\r\nvoluminous correspondence. His feelings, hopes, intentions, and actual\r\ncircumstances are described to different correspondents at the same time\r\nin utterly different ways. He was always writing for effect, and often for\r\neffect of a rather sordid kind. He seldom gave a definite opinion on any\r\nimportant question without attempting to qualify it in such a manner that\r\nhe might be able, if need arose, to deny that he had given it. No man knew\r\nbetter how to use “if” and “but” so as to shelter himself from all\r\nresponsibility. He had the ingenuity of the cuttle-fish to conceal himself\r\nand his real opinions, and it was commonly used to protect his own skin.\r\nAll this may be admitted; it can scarcely be denied.\r\n\r\nYet from his first visit to England (1498) down to his practical refusal\r\nof a Cardinal’s Hat from Pope Adrian VI., on condition that he would\r\nreside at Rome and assist in fighting the Reformation, Erasmus had his own\r\nconception of what a reformation of Christianity really meant, and what\r\nshare in it it was possible for him to take. It must be admitted that he\r\nheld to this idea and kept to the path he had marked out for himself with\r\na tenacity of purpose which did him honour. It was by no means always that\r\nof personal safety, still less the road to personal aggrandisement. It led\r\nhim in the end where he had never expected to stand. It made him a man\r\ndespised by both sides in the great controversy; it left him absolutely\r\nalone, friendless, and without influence. He frequently used very\r\ncontemptible means to ward off attempts to make him diverge to the right\r\nor left; he abandoned many of his earlier principles, or so modified them\r\nthat they were no longer recognisable. But he was always true to his own\r\nidea of a reformation and of his life-work as a reformer.\r\n\r\nErasmus was firmly convinced that Christianity was above all things\r\nsomething practical. It had to do with the ordinary life of mankind. It\r\nmeant love, humility, purity, reverence,—every virtue which the Saviour\r\nhad made manifest in His life on earth. This early “Christian philosophy”\r\nhad been buried out of sight under a Scholastic Theology full of\r\nsophistical subtleties, and had been lost in the mingled Judaism and\r\nPaganism of the popular religious life, with its weary ceremonies and\r\nbarbarous usages. A true reformation, he believed, was the moral\r\nrenovation of mankind, and the one need of the age was to return to that\r\nearlier purer religion based on a real inward reverence for and imitation\r\nof Christ. The man of letters, like himself, he conceived could play the\r\npart of a reformer, and that manfully, in two ways. He could try, by the\r\nuse of wit and satire, to make contemptible the follies of the Schoolmen\r\nand the vulgar travesty of religion which was in vogue among the people.\r\nHe could also bring before the eyes of all men that earlier and purer\r\nreligion which was true Christianity. He could edit the New Testament, and\r\nenable men to read the very words which Jesus spoke and Paul preached,\r\nmake them see the deeds of Jesus and hear the apostolic explanations of\r\ntheir meaning. He could say:\r\n\r\n\r\n    “Only be teachable, and you have already made much way in this\r\n    (the Christian) Philosophy. It supplies a spirit for a teacher,\r\n    imparted to none more readily than to the simple-minded. Other\r\n    philosophies, by the very difficulty of their precepts, are\r\n    removed out of the range of most minds. No age, no sex, no\r\n    condition of life is excluded from this. The sun itself is not\r\n    more common and open to all than the teaching of Christ. For I\r\n    utterly dissent from those who are unwilling that the Sacred\r\n    Scriptures should be read by the unlearned translated into their\r\n    vulgar tongue, as though Christ had taught such subtleties that\r\n    they can scarcely be understood even by a few theologians, or as\r\n    though the strength of the Christian religion consisted in men’s\r\n    ignorance of it. The mysteries of kings it may be safer to\r\n    conceal, but Christ wished His mysteries to be published as openly\r\n    as possible. I wish that even the weakest woman should read the\r\n    Gospel—should read the Epistles of Paul. And I wish these were\r\n    translated into all languages, so that they might be read and\r\n    understood, not only by Scots and Irishmen, but also by Turks and\r\n    Saracens. To make them understood is surely the first step. It may\r\n    be that they might be ridiculed by many, but some would take them\r\n    to heart. I long that the husbandman should sing portions of them\r\n    to himself as he follows the plough, that the weaver should hum\r\n    them to the tune of his shuttle, that the traveller should beguile\r\n    with their stories the tedium of his journey.”(122)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe scholar who became a reformer could further make plain, by editing and\r\npublishing the writings of the earlier Christian Fathers, what the oldest\r\nChristian Theology had been before the Schoolmen spoiled it.\r\n\r\nThe conception that a reformation of Christianity was mainly a renovation\r\nof morals, enabled the Christian Humanist to keep true to the Renaissance\r\nidea that the writers of classical antiquity were to be used to aid the\r\nwork of ameliorating the lot of mankind. The Florentine circle spoke of\r\nthe inspiration of Homer, of Plato, and of Cicero, and saw them labouring\r\nas our Lord had done to teach men how to live better lives. Pico and\r\nReuchlin had gone further afield, and had found illuminating anticipations\r\nof Christianity, in this sense and in others, among the Hebrews, the\r\nEgyptians, and perhaps the Brahmins. Erasmus was too clear-sighted to be\r\ndrawn into any alliance with Oriental mysticism or cabalistic\r\nspeculations; but he insisted on the aid which would come from the\r\nChristian reformer making full use of the ethical teaching of the wise men\r\nof Greece and Rome in his attempt to produce a moral renovation in the\r\nlives of his fellows. Socrates and Cicero, each in his own day and within\r\nhis own sphere, had striven for the same moral renovation that\r\nChristianity promised, and, in this sense at least, might be called\r\nChristians before Christ. So persuaded was Erasmus of their affinity with\r\nthe true spirit of Christianity, that he declared that Cicero had as much\r\nright to a high place in heaven as many a Christian saint, and that when\r\nhe thought of the Athenian martyr he could scarcely refrain from saying,\r\n_Sancte Socrates, Ora pro nobis_.\r\n\r\nIt must be remembered also that Erasmus had a genuine and noble horror of\r\nwar, which was by no means the mere shrinking of a man whose nerves were\r\nalways quivering. He preached peace as boldly and in as disinterested a\r\nfashion as did his friend John Colet. He could not bear the thought of a\r\nreligious war. This must not be forgotten in any estimate of his conduct\r\nand of his relation to the Reformation. No man, not even Luther, scattered\r\nthe seeds of revolution with a more reckless hand, and yet a thorough and\r\nsteadfast dislike to all movements which could be called revolutionary was\r\none of the most abiding elements in his character. He hated what he called\r\nthe “tumult.” He had an honest belief that all public evils in State and\r\nChurch must be endured until they dissolve away quietly under the\r\ninfluence of sarcasm and common sense, or until they are removed by the\r\naction of the responsible authorities. He was clear-sighted enough to see\r\nthat an open and avowed attack on the papal supremacy, or on any of the\r\nmore cherished doctrines and usages of the mediæval Church, must end in\r\nstrife and in bloodshed, and he therefore honestly believed that no such\r\nattack ought to be made.\r\n\r\nWhen all these things are kept in view, it is possible to see what\r\nconception Erasmus had about his work as a reformer, with its\r\npossibilities and its limitations. He adhered to it tenaciously all his\r\nlife. He held it in the days of his earlier comparative obscurity. He\r\nmaintained it when he had been enthroned as the prince of the realm of\r\nlearning. He clung to it in his discredited old age. No one can justify\r\nthe means he sometimes took to prevent being drawn from the path he had\r\nmarked out for himself; but there is something to be said for the man who,\r\nthrough good report and evil, stuck resolutely to his view of what a\r\nreformation ought to be, and what were the functions of a man of letters\r\nwho felt himself called to be a reformer. Had Luther been gifted with that\r\nkeen sense of prevision with which Erasmus was so fatally endowed, would\r\nhe have stood forward to attack Indulgences in the way he did? It is\r\nprobable that it would have made no difference in his action; but he did\r\nnot think so himself. He said once, “No good work comes about by our own\r\nwisdom; it begins in dire necessity. I was forced into mine; but had I\r\nknown then what I know now, ten wild horses would not have drawn me into\r\nit.” The man who leads a great movement of reform may see the distant, but\r\nhas seldom a clear vision of the nearer future. He is one who feels the\r\nslow pressure of an imperious spiritual power, who is content with one\r\nstep at a time, and who does not ask to see the whole path stretching out\r\nbefore him.\r\n\r\nErasmus lost both his parents while he was a child, and never enjoyed the\r\nadvantages of a home training. He was driven by deceit or by\r\nself-deception into a monastery when he was a lad. He escaped from the\r\nclutches of the monastic life when he was twenty years of age, broken in\r\nhealth, and having learned to know human nature on its bad side and to\r\ntrade on that knowledge. He was one of the loneliest of mortals, and\r\ntrusted in no one but himself. With one great exception, he had no\r\nfriendship which left an enduring influence on his character. From\r\nchildhood he taught himself in his own way; when he grew to manhood he\r\nplanned and schemed for himself; he steadfastly refused to be drawn into\r\nany kind of work which he did not like for its own sake; he persistently\r\nshunned every entanglement which might have controlled his action or\r\nweighted him with any responsibility. He stands almost alone among the\r\nHumanists in this. All the others were officials, or professors, or\r\nprivate teachers, or jurists, or ecclesiastics. Erasmus was nothing, and\r\nwould be nothing, but a simple man of letters.\r\n\r\nHolbein has painted him so often that his features are familiar. Every\r\nline of the clearly cut face suggests demure sarcasm—the thin lips closely\r\npressed together, the half-closed eyelids, and the keen glance of the\r\nscarcely seen blue eyes. The head is intellectual, but there is nothing\r\nmasculine about the portrait—nothing suggesting the massiveness of the\r\nlearned burgher Pirkheimer; or the jovial strength of the Humanist\r\n_landsknecht_ Eobanus Hessus; or the lean wolf-like tenacity of Hutten,\r\nthe descendant of robber-knights; or the steadfast homely courage of\r\nMartin Luther. The dainty hands, which Holbein drew so often, and the\r\ngeneral primness of his appearance, suggest a descent from a long line of\r\nmaiden aunts. The keen intelligence was enclosed in a sickly body, whose\r\nfrailty made continuous demands on the soul it imprisoned. It needed warm\r\nrooms with stoves that sent forth no smell, the best wines, an easy-going\r\nhorse, and a deft servant; and to procure all these comforts Erasmus wrote\r\nthe sturdiest of begging letters and stooped to all kinds of flatteries.\r\n\r\nThe visit which Erasmus paid to England in 1498 was the turning-point in\r\nhis life. He found himself, for the first time, among men who were his\r\nequals in learning and his superiors in many things. “When I listen to my\r\nfriend Colet,” he says, “it seems to me like listening to Plato himself.\r\nWho does not marvel at the complete mastery of the sciences in Grocyn?\r\nWhat could be keener, more profound, and more searching than the judgment\r\nof Linacre? Has Nature ever made a more gentle, a sweeter, or a happier\r\ndisposition than Thomas More’s?” He made the acquaintance of men as full\r\nof the New Learning as he was himself, who hated the Scotist theology more\r\nbitterly than he did, and who nevertheless believed in a pure, simple\r\nChristian philosophy, and were earnest Christians. They urged him to join\r\nthem in their work, and we can trace in the correspondence of Erasmus the\r\ngrowing influence of Colet. The Dean of St. Paul’s made Erasmus the\r\ndecidedly Christian Humanist he became, and impressed on him that\r\nconception of a reformation which, leaving external things very much as\r\nthey were, undertook a renovation of morals. He never lost the impress of\r\nColet’s stamp.\r\n\r\nIt would appear from one of Erasmus’ letters that Colet urged him to write\r\ncommentaries on some portions of the New Testament; but Erasmus would only\r\nwork in his own way; and it is probable that his thoughts were soon turned\r\nto preparing an edition of the New Testament in Greek. The task was long\r\nbrooded over; and he had to perfect himself in his knowledge of the\r\nlanguage.\r\n\r\nThis determination to undertake no work for which he was not supremely\r\nfitted, together with his powers of application and acquisition, gave\r\nErasmus the reputation of being a strong man. He was seen to be unlike any\r\nother Humanist, whether Italian or German. He had no desire merely to\r\nreproduce the antique, or to confine himself within the narrow circle in\r\nwhich the “Poets” of the Renaissance worked. He put ancient culture to\r\nmodern uses. Erasmus was no arm-chair student. He was one of the keenest\r\nobservers of everything human—the Lucian or the Voltaire of the sixteenth\r\ncentury. From under his half-closed eyelids his quick glance seized and\r\nretained the salient characteristics of all sorts and conditions of men\r\nand women. He described theologians, jurists and philosophers, monks and\r\nparish priests, merchants and soldiers, husbands and wives, women good and\r\nbad, dancers and diners, pilgrims, pardon-sellers, and keepers of relics;\r\nthe peasant in the field, the artisan in the workshop, and the vagrant on\r\nthe highway. He had studied all, and could describe them with a few deft\r\nphrases, as incisive as Dürer’s strokes, with an almost perfect style, and\r\nwith easy sarcasm.\r\n\r\nThis application of the New Learning to portray the common life, combined\r\nwith his profound learning, made Erasmus the idol of the young German\r\nHumanists. They said that he was more than mortal, that his judgment was\r\ninfallible, and that his work was perfect. They made pilgrimages to visit\r\nhim. An interview was an event to be talked about for years; a letter, a\r\nprecious treasure to be bequeathed as an heirloom. Some men refused to\r\nrender the universal homage accorded by scholars and statesmen, by princes\r\nlay and clerical. Luther scented Pelagian theology in his annotations; he\r\nscorned Erasmus’ wilful playing with truth; he said that the great\r\nHumanist was a mocker who poured ridicule upon everything, even on Christ\r\nand religion. There was some ground for the charge. His sarcasm was not\r\nconfined to his _Praise of Folly_ or to his _Colloquies_. It appears in\r\nalmost everything that he wrote—even in his Paraphrases of the New\r\nTestament.\r\n\r\nThat such a man should have felt himself called upon to be a reformer,\r\nthat this Saul should have appeared among the prophets, is in itself\r\ntestimony that he lived during a great religious crisis, and that the\r\nreligious question was the most important one in his days.\r\n\r\nThe principal literary works of Erasmus meant to serve the reformation he\r\ndesired to see are:—two small books, _Enchiridion militis christiani_ (_A\r\nHandbook of the Christian Soldier_, or _A Pocket Dagger for the Christian\r\nSoldier_—it may be translated either way), first printed in 1503, and\r\n_Institutio Principis Christiani_ (1518); his _Encomium Moriæ_ (_Praise of\r\nFolly_, 1511); his edition of the _New Testament_, or _Novum Instrumentum_\r\n(1516), with prefaces and paraphrases; and perhaps many of the dialogues\r\nin his _Colloquia_ (1519).\r\n\r\nErasmus himself explains that in the _Enchiridion_ he wrote to counteract\r\nthe vulgar error of those who think that religion consists in ceremonies\r\nand in more than Jewish observances, while they neglect what really\r\nbelongs to piety. The whole aim of the book is to assert the individual\r\nresponsibility of man to God apart from any intermediate human agency.\r\nErasmus ignores as completely as Luther would have done the whole mediæval\r\nthought of the mediatorial function of the Church and its priestly order.\r\nIn this respect the book is essentially Protestant and thoroughly\r\nrevolutionary. It asserts in so many words that much of the popular\r\nreligion is pure paganism:\r\n\r\n\r\n    “One worships a certain Rochus, and why? because he fancies he\r\n    will drive away the plague from his body. Another mumbles prayers\r\n    to Barbara or George, lest he fall into the hands of his enemy.\r\n    This man fasts to Apollonia to prevent the toothache. That one\r\n    gazes upon an image of the divine Job, that he may be free from\r\n    the itch.... In short, whatever our fears and our desires, we set\r\n    so many gods over them, and these are different in different\r\n    nations.... This is not far removed from the superstition of those\r\n    who used to vow tithes to Hercules in order to get rich, or a cock\r\n    to Æsculapius to recover from an illness, or who slew a bull to\r\n    Neptune for a favourable voyage. The names are changed, but the\r\n    object is the same.”(123)\r\n\r\n\r\nIn speaking of the monastic life, he says:\r\n\r\n\r\n    “ ‘Love,’ says Paul, ‘is to edify your neighbour,’ ... and if this\r\n    only were done, nothing could be more joyous or more easy than the\r\n    life of the ‘religious’; but now this life seems gloomy, full of\r\n    Jewish superstitions, not in any way free from the vices of laymen\r\n    and in some ways more corrupt. If Augustine, whom they boast of as\r\n    the founder of their order, came to life again, he would not\r\n    recognise them; he would exclaim that he had never approved of\r\n    this sort of life, but had organised a way of living according to\r\n    the rule of the Apostles, not according to the superstition of the\r\n    Jews.”(124)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe more one studies the _Praise of Folly_, the more evident it becomes\r\nthat Erasmus did not intend to write a satire on human weakness in\r\ngeneral: the book is the most severe attack on the mediæval Church that\r\nhad, up to that time, been made; and it was meant to be so. The author\r\nwanders from his main theme occasionally, but always to return to the\r\ninsane follies of the religious life sanctioned by the highest authorities\r\nof the mediæval Church. Popes, bishops, theologians, monks, and the\r\nordinary lay Christians, are all unmitigated fools in their ordinary\r\nreligious life. The style is vivid, the author has seen what he describes,\r\nand he makes his readers see it also. He writes with a mixture of light\r\nmockery and bitter earnestness. He exposes the foolish questions of the\r\ntheologians; the vices and temporal ambitions of the Popes, bishops, and\r\nmonks; the stupid trust in festivals, pilgrimages, indulgences, and\r\nrelics. The theologians, the author says, are rather dangerous people to\r\nattack, for they come down on one with their six hundred conclusions and\r\ncommand him to recant, and if he does not they declare him a heretic\r\nforthwith. The problems which interest them are:\r\n\r\n\r\n    “Whether there was any instant of time in the divine generation?\r\n    ... Could God have taken the form of a woman, a devil, an ass, a\r\n    gourd, or a stone? How the gourd could have preached, wrought\r\n    miracles, hung on the cross?”(125)\r\n\r\n\r\nHe jeers at the Popes and higher ecclesiastics:\r\n\r\n\r\n    “Those supreme Pontiffs who stand in the place of Christ, if they\r\n    should try to imitate His life, that is, His poverty, His toil,\r\n    His teaching, His cross, and His scorn of this world ... what\r\n    could be more dreadful!... We ought not to forget that such a mass\r\n    of scribes, copyists, notaries, advocates, secretaries,\r\n    mule-drivers, grooms, money-changers, procurers, and gayer persons\r\n    yet I might mention, did I not respect your ears,—that this whole\r\n    swarm which now burdens—I beg your pardon, honours—the Roman See\r\n    would be driven to starvation.”(126)\r\n\r\n\r\nAs for the monks:\r\n\r\n\r\n    “The greater part of them have such faith in their ceremonies and\r\n    human traditions, that they think one heaven is not reward enough\r\n    for such great doings.... One will show his belly stuffed with\r\n    every kind of fish; another will pour out a hundred bushels of\r\n    psalms; another will count up myriads of fasts, and make up for\r\n    them all again by almost bursting himself at a single dinner.\r\n    Another will bring forward such a heap of ceremonies that seven\r\n    ships would hardly hold them; another boast that for sixty years\r\n    he has never touched a penny except with double gloves on his\r\n    hands.... But Christ will interrupt their endless bragging, and\r\n    will demand—‘Whence this new kind of Judaism?’\r\n\r\n    “They do all things by rule, by a kind of sacred mathematics; as,\r\n    for instance, how many knots their shoes must be tied with, of\r\n    what colour everything must be, what variety in their garb, of\r\n    what material, how many straws’-breadth to their girdle, of what\r\n    form and of how many bushels’ capacity their cowl, how many\r\n    fingers broad their hair, and how many hours they sleep....”(127)\r\n\r\n\r\nHe ridicules men who go running about to Rome, Compostella, or Jerusalem,\r\nwasting on long and dangerous journeys money which might be better spent\r\nin feeding the hungry and clothing the naked. He scoffs at those who buy\r\nIndulgences, who sweetly flatter themselves with counterfeit pardons, and\r\nwho have measured off the duration of Purgatory without error, as if by a\r\nwater-clock, into ages, years, months, and days, like the multiplication\r\ntable.(128) Is it religion to believe that if any one pays a penny out of\r\nwhat he has stolen, he can have the whole slough of his life cleaned out\r\nat once, and all his perjuries, lusts, drunkennesses, all his quarrels,\r\nmurders, cheats, treacheries, falsehoods, bought off in such a way that he\r\nmay begin over again with a new circle of crimes? The reverence for relics\r\nwas perhaps never so cruelly satirised as in the Colloquy, _Peregrinatio\r\nReligionis Ergo_.\r\n\r\nIt must be remembered that this bitter satire was written some years\r\nbefore Luther began the Reformation by an attack on Indulgences. It may\r\nseem surprising how much liberty the satirist allowed himself, and how\r\nmuch was permitted to him. But Erasmus knew very well how to protect\r\nhimself. He was very careful to make no definite attack, and to make no\r\nmention of names. He was always ready to explain that he did not mean to\r\nattack the Papacy, but only bad Popes; that he had the highest respect for\r\nthe monastic life, and only satirised evil-minded monks; or that he\r\nreverenced the saints, but thought that reverence ought to be shown by\r\nimitating them in their lives of piety. He could say all this with perfect\r\ntruth. Indeed, it is likely that with all his scorn against the monks,\r\nErasmus, in his heart, believed that a devout Capuchin or Franciscan monk\r\nlived the ideal Christian life. He seems to say so in his Colloquy,\r\n_Militis et Carthusiani_. He wrote, moreover, before the dignitaries of\r\nthe mediæval Church had begun to take alarm. Liberal Churchmen who were\r\nthe patrons of the New Learning had no objection to see the vices of the\r\ntimes and the Church life of the day satirised by one who wrote such\r\nexquisite latinity. In all his more serious work Erasmus was careful to\r\nshelter himself under the protection of great ecclesiastics.\r\n\r\nErasmus was not the only scholar who had proposed to publish a correct\r\nedition of the Holy Scriptures. The great Spaniard, Cardinal Ximenes, had\r\nannounced that he meant to bring out an edition of the Holy Scriptures in\r\nwhich the text of the Vulgate would appear in parallel columns along with\r\nthe Hebrew and the Greek. The prospectus of this Complutensian Polyglot\r\nwas issued as early as 1502; the work was finished in 1517, and was\r\npublished in Spain in 1520 and in other lands in 1522. Erasmus was careful\r\nto dedicate the first edition of his _Novum Instrumentum_, (1516) to Pope\r\nLeo X., who graciously received it. He sent the second edition to the same\r\nPope in 1519, accompanied by a letter in which he says:\r\n\r\n\r\n    “I have striven with all my might to kindle men from those\r\n    chilling argumentations in which they had been so long frozen up,\r\n    to a zeal for theology which should be at once more pure and more\r\n    serious. And that this labour has so far not been in vain I\r\n    perceive from this, that certain persons are furious against me,\r\n    who cannot value anything they are unable to teach and are ashamed\r\n    to learn. But, trusting to Christ as my witness, whom my writings\r\n    above all would guard, to the judgment of your Holiness, to my own\r\n    sense of right and the approval of so many distinguished men, I\r\n    have always disregarded the yelpings of these people. Whatever\r\n    little talent I have, it has been, once for all, dedicated to\r\n    Christ: it shall serve His glory alone; it shall serve the Roman\r\n    Church, the prince of that Church, but especially your Holiness,\r\n    to whom I owe more than my whole duty.”\r\n\r\n\r\nHe dedicated the various parts of the _Paraphrases_ of the New Testament\r\nto Cardinal Campeggio, to Cardinal Wolsey, to Henry VIII., to Charles V.,\r\nand to Francis I. of France. He deliberately placed himself under the\r\nprotection of those princes, ecclesiastical and secular, who could not be\r\nsuspected of having any revolutionary designs against the existing state\r\nof things in Church or in State.\r\n\r\nIn all this he was followed for the time being by the most distinguished\r\nChristian Humanists in England, France, and Germany. They were full of the\r\nbrightest hopes. A Humanist Pope sat on the throne of St. Peter, young\r\nHumanist kings ruled France and England, the Emperor Maximilian had long\r\nbeen the patron of German Humanism, and much was expected from his\r\ngrandson Charles, the young King of Spain. Erasmus, the acknowledged\r\nprince of Christian learning, was enthusiastically supported by Colet and\r\nMore in England, by Buddæus and Lefèvre in France, by Johann Staupitz,\r\nCochlæus, Thomas Murner, Jerome Emser, Conrad Mutianus, and George\r\nSpalatin in Germany. They all believed that the golden age was\r\napproaching, when the secular princes would forbid wars, and the\r\necclesiastical lay aside their rapacity, and when both would lead the\r\npeoples of Europe in a reformation of morals and in a re-establishment of\r\npure religion. Their hopes were high that all would be effected without\r\nthe “tumult” which they all dreaded, and when the storm burst, many of\r\nthem became bitter opponents of Luther and his action. Luther found no\r\ndeadlier enemies than Thomas Murner and Jerome Emser. Others, like George\r\nSpalatin, became his warmest supporters. Erasmus maintained to the end his\r\nattitude of cautious neutrality. In a long letter to Marlianus, Bishop of\r\nTuy in Spain, he says that he does not like Luther’s writings, that he\r\nfeared from the first that they would create a “tumult,” but that he dare\r\nnot altogether oppose the reformer, “because he feared that he might be\r\nfighting against God.” The utmost that he could be brought to do after the\r\nstrongest persuasions, was to attack Luther’s Augustinian theology in his\r\n_De Libero Arbitrio_, and to insinuate a defence of the principle of\r\necclesiastical authority in the interpretation of Scripture, and a proof\r\nthat Luther had laid too much stress on the element of “grace” in human\r\nactions. He turned away from the whole movement as far as he possibly\r\ncould, protesting that for himself he would ever cling to the Roman See.\r\n\r\nThe last years of his life were spent in excessive literary work—in\r\nediting the earlier Christian Fathers; he completed his edition of Origen\r\nin 1536, the year of his death. He settled at Louvain, and found it too\r\nhotly theological for his comfort; went to Basel; wandered off to\r\nFreiburg; then went back to Basel to die. After his death he was compelled\r\nto take the side he had so long shrunk from. Pope Paul IV. classed him as\r\na notorious heretic, and placed on the first papal “Index” “all his\r\ncommentaries, notes, scholia, dialogues, letters, translations, books, and\r\nwritings, even when they contain nothing against religion or about\r\nreligion.”\r\n\r\nWe look in vain for any indication that those Christian Humanists\r\nperceived that they were actually living in a time of revolution, and were\r\nreally standing on the edge of a crater which was about to change European\r\nhistory by its eruption. Sir Thomas More’s instincts of religious life\r\nwere all mediæval. Colet had persuaded him to abandon his earlier impulse\r\nto enter a monastic order, but More wore a hair shirt next his skin till\r\nthe day of his death. Yet in his sketch of an ideal commonwealth, he\r\nexpanded St. Paul’s thought of the equality of all men before Christ into\r\nthe conception that no man was to be asked to work more than six hours a\r\nday, and showed that religious freedom could only flourish where there was\r\nnothing in the form of the mediæval Church. The lovable and pious young\r\nEnglishman never imagined that his academic dream would be translated into\r\nrude practical thoughts and ruder actions by leaders of peasant and\r\nartisan insurgents, and that his _Utopia_ (1515), within ten years after\r\nits publication, and ten years before his own death (1535), would furnish\r\ntexts for communist sermons, preached in obscure public-houses or to\r\nexcited audiences on village greens. The satirical criticisms of the\r\nhierarchy, the monastic orders, and the popular religious life, which\r\nErasmus flung broadcast so recklessly in his lighter and more serious\r\nwritings, furnished the weapons for the leaders in that “tumult” which he\r\nhad dreaded all his days; and when he complained that few seemed to care\r\nfor the picture of a truly pious life, given in his _Enchiridion_, he did\r\nnot foresee that it would become a wonderfully popular book among those\r\nwho renounced all connection with the See of Rome to which the author had\r\npromised a life-long obedience. The Christian Humanists, one and all, were\r\nstrangely blind to the signs of the times in which they lived.\r\n\r\nNo one can fail to appreciate the nobility of the purpose to work for a\r\ngreat moral renovation of mankind which the Christian Humanists ever kept\r\nbefore them, or refuse to see that they were always and everywhere\r\npreachers of righteousness. When we remember the century and a half of\r\nwars, so largely excited by ecclesiastical motives, which desolated Europe\r\nduring the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, few can withhold their\r\nsympathy from the Christian Humanist idea that the path of reformation lay\r\nthrough a great readjustment of the existing conditions of the religious\r\nlife, rather than through ecclesiastical revolution to a thorough-going\r\nreconstruction; although we may sadly recognise that the dynastic\r\nstruggles of secular princes, the rapacity and religious impotence of\r\nPopes and ecclesiastical authorities, and the imperious pressure of social\r\nand industrial discontent, made the path of peace impossible. But what\r\nmust fill us with surprise is that the Christian Humanists seemed to\r\nbelieve with a childlike innocence that the constituted authorities,\r\nsecular and ecclesiastical, would lead the way in this peaceful reform,\r\nmainly because they were tinged with Humanist culture, and were the\r\npatrons of artists and men of learning. Humanism meant to Pope Leo X. and\r\nto the young Archbishop of Mainz additional sources of enjoyment,\r\nrepresented by costly pictures, collections of MSS., and rare books, the\r\ngratification of their taste for jewels and cameos, to say nothing of less\r\nharmless indulgences, and the adulation of the circle of scholars whom\r\nthey had attracted to their courts; and it meant little more to the\r\nyounger secular princes.\r\n\r\nIt is also to be feared that the Christian Humanists had no real sense of\r\nwhat was needed for that renovation of morals, public and private, which\r\nthey ardently desired to see. Pictures of a Christian life lived according\r\nto the principles of reason, sharp polemic against the hierarchy, and\r\nbiting mockery of the stupidity of the popular religion, did not help the\r\nmasses of the people. The multitude in those early decades of the\r\nsixteenth century were scourged by constant visitations of the plague and\r\nother new and strange diseases, and they lived in perpetual dread of a\r\nTurkish invasion. The fear of death and the judgment thereafter was always\r\nbefore their eyes. What they wanted was a sense of God’s forgiveness for\r\ntheir sins, and they greedily seized on Indulgences, pilgrimages to holy\r\nplaces, and relic-worship to secure the pardon they longed for. The\r\naristocratic and intellectual reform, contemplated by the Christian\r\nHumanists, scarcely appealed to them. Their longing for a certainty of\r\nsalvation could not be satisfied with recommendations to virtuous living\r\naccording to the rules of Neo-Platonic ethics. It is pathetic to listen to\r\nthe appeals made to Erasmus for something more than he could ever give:\r\n\r\n\r\n    “ ‘Oh! Erasmus of Rotterdam, where art thou?’ said Albert Dürer.\r\n    ‘See what the unjust tyranny of earthly power, the power of\r\n    darkness, can do. Hear, thou knight of Christ! Ride forth by the\r\n    side of the Lord Christ; defend the truth, gain the martyr’s\r\n    crown! As it is, thou art but an old man. I have heard thee say\r\n    that thou hast given thyself but a couple more years of active\r\n    service; spend them, I pray, to the profit of the gospel and the\r\n    true Christian faith, and believe me the gates of Hell, the See of\r\n    Rome, as Christ has said, will not prevail against thee.’ ”(129)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Reformation needed a man who had himself felt that commanding need of\r\npardon which was sending his fellows travelling from shrine to shrine, who\r\ncould tell them in plain homely words, which the common man could\r\nunderstand, how each one of them could win that pardon for himself, who\r\ncould deliver them from the fear of the priest, and show them the way to\r\nthe peace of God. The Reformation needed Luther.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK II. THE REFORMATION.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter I. Luther to the Beginning of the Controversy About\r\nIndulgences.(130)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 1. Why Luther was successful as the Leader in a Reformation.\r\n\r\n\r\nReformation had been attempted in various ways. Learned ecclesiastical\r\nJurists had sought to bring it about in the fifteenth century by what was\r\ncalled _Conciliar Reform_. The sincerity and ability of the leaders of the\r\nmovement are unquestioned; but they had failed ignominiously, and the\r\nPapacy with all its abuses had never been so powerful ecclesiastically as\r\nwhen its superior diplomacy had vanquished the endeavour to hold it in\r\ntutelage to a council.\r\n\r\nThe Christian Humanists had made their attempt—preaching a moral\r\nrenovation and the application of the existing laws of the Church to\r\npunish ecclesiastical wrong-doers. Colet eloquently assured the Anglican\r\nConvocation that the Church possessed laws which, if only enforced,\r\ncontained provisions ample enough to curb and master the ills which all\r\nfelt to be rampant. Erasmus had held up to scorn the debased religious\r\nlife of the times, and had denounced its Judaism and Paganism. Both were\r\nmen of scholarship and genius; but they had never been able to move\r\nsociety to its depths, and awaken a new religious life, which was the one\r\nthing needful.\r\n\r\nHistory knows nothing of revivals of moral living apart from some new\r\nreligious impulse. The motive power needed has always come through leaders\r\nwho have had communion with the unseen. Humanism had supplied a\r\nsuperfluity of teachers; the times needed a prophet. They received one; a\r\nman of the people; bone of their bone, and flesh of their flesh; one who\r\nhad himself lived that popular religious life with all the thoroughness of\r\na strong, earnest nature, who had sounded all its depths and tested its\r\ncapacities, and gained in the end no relief for his burdened conscience;\r\nwho had at last found his way into the presence of God, and who knew, by\r\nhis own personal experience, that the living God was accessible to every\r\nChristian. He had won the freedom of a Christian man, and had reached\r\nthrough faith a joy in living far deeper than that which Humanism boasted.\r\nHe became a leader of men, because his joyous faith made him a hero by\r\ndelivering him from all fear of Church or of clergy—the fear which had\r\nweighed down the consciences of men for generations. Men could _see_ what\r\nfaith was when they looked at Luther.\r\n\r\nIt must never be forgotten that to his contemporaries Luther was the\r\nembodiment of personal piety. All spoke of his sensitiveness to religious\r\nimpressions of all kinds in his early years. While he was inside the\r\nconvent, whether before or after he had found deliverance for his troubles\r\nof soul, his fellows regarded him as a model of piety. In later days, when\r\nhe stood forth as a Reformer, he became such a power in the hearts of men\r\nof all sorts and ranks, because he was seen to be a thoroughly pious man.\r\nAlbert Dürer may be taken as a type. In the great painter’s diary of the\r\njourney he made with his wife and her maid Susanna to the Netherlands\r\n(1520),—a mere summary of the places he visited and the persons he saw, of\r\nwhat he paid for food and lodging and travel, of the prices he got for his\r\npictures, and what he paid for his purchases, literary and artistic,—he\r\ntells how he heard of Luther’s condemnation at Worms, of the Reformer’s\r\ndisappearance, of his supposed murder by Popish emissaries (for so the\r\nreport went through Germany), and the news compelled him to that pouring\r\nforth of prayers, of exclamations, of fervent appeals, and of bitter\r\nregrets, which fills three out of the whole forty-six pages. The Luther he\r\nalmost worships is the “pious man,” the “follower of the Lord and of the\r\ntrue Christian faith,” the “man enlightened by the Holy Spirit,” the man\r\nwho had been done to death by the Pope and the priests of his day, as the\r\nSon of God had been murdered by the priests of Jerusalem. The one thing\r\nwhich fills the great painter’s mind is the personal religious life of the\r\nman Martin Luther.(131)\r\n\r\nAnother source of Luther’s power was that he had been led step by step,\r\nand that his countrymen could follow him deliberately without being\r\nstartled by any too sudden changes. He was one of themselves; he took them\r\ninto his confidence at every stage of his public career; they knew him\r\nthoroughly. He had been a monk, and that was natural for a youth of his\r\nexemplary piety. He had lived a model monastic life; his companions and\r\nhis superiors were unwearied in commending him. He had spoken openly what\r\nalmost all good men had been feeling privately about Indulgences in plain\r\nlanguage which all could understand; and he had gradually taught himself\r\nand his countrymen, who were following his career breathlessly, that the\r\nman who trusted in God did not need to fear the censures of Pope or of the\r\nclergy. He emancipated not merely the learned and cultivated classes, but\r\nthe common people, from the fear of the Church; and this was the one thing\r\nneedful for a true reformation. So long as the people of Europe believed\r\nthat the priesthood had some mysterious powers, no matter how vague or\r\nindefinite, over the spiritual and eternal welfare of men and women,\r\nfreedom of conscience and a renovation of the public and private moral\r\nlife was impossible. The spiritual world will always have its anxieties\r\nand terrors for every Christian soul, and the greatest achievement of\r\nLuther was that by teaching and, above all, by example, he showed the\r\ncommon man that he was in God’s hands, and not dependent on the blessing\r\nor banning of a clerical caste. For Luther’s doctrine of Justification by\r\nFaith, as he himself showed in his tract on the _Liberty of a Christian\r\nMan_ (1520), was simply that there was nothing in the indefinite claim\r\nwhich the mediæval Church had always made. From the moment the common\r\npeople, simple men and women, knew and felt this, they were freed from the\r\nmysterious dread of Church and priesthood; they could look the clergy\r\nfairly in the face, and could care little for their threats. It was\r\nbecause Luther had freed himself from this dread, because the people, who\r\nknew him to be a deeply pious man, saw that he was free from it, and\r\ntherefore that they need be in no concern about it, that he became the\r\ngreat reformer and the popular leader in an age which was compelled to\r\nrevise its thoughts about spiritual things.\r\n\r\nHence it is that we may say without exaggeration that the Reformation was\r\nembodied in Martin Luther, that it lived in him as in no one else, and\r\nthat its inner religious history may be best studied in the record of his\r\nspiritual experiences and in the growth of his religious convictions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 2. Luther’s Youth and Education.\r\n\r\n\r\nMartin Luther was born in 1483 (Nov. 10th) at Eisleben, and spent his\r\nchildhood in the small mining town of Mansfeld. His father, Hans Luther,\r\nhad belonged to Möhra (Moortown), a small peasant township lying in the\r\nnorth-east corner of the Thuringian Wald, and his mother, Margarethe\r\nZiegler, had come from a burgher family in Eisenach. It was a custom among\r\nthese Thuringian peasants that only one son, and that usually the\r\nyoungest, inherited the family house and the croft. The others were sent\r\nout one by one, furnished with a small store of money from the family\r\nstrong-box, to make their way in the world. Hans Luther had determined to\r\nbecome a miner in the Mansfeld district, where the policy of the Counts of\r\nMansfeld, of building and letting out on hire small smelting furnaces,\r\nenabled thrifty and skilled workmen to rise in the world. The father soon\r\nmade his way. He leased one and then three of these furnaces. He won the\r\nrespect of his neighbours, for he became, in 1491, one of the four members\r\nof the village council, and we are told that the Counts of Mansfeld held\r\nhim in esteem.\r\n\r\nIn the earlier years, when Luther was a child, the family life was one of\r\ngrinding poverty, and Luther often recalled the hard struggles of his\r\nparents. He had often seen his mother carrying the wood for the family\r\nfire from the forest on her poor shoulders. The child grew up among the\r\nhard, grimy, coarse surroundings of the German working-class life,\r\nprotected from much that was evil by the wise severity of his parents. He\r\nimbibed its simple political and ecclesiastical ideas. He learned that the\r\nEmperor was God’s ruler on earth, who would protect poor people against\r\nthe Turk, and that the Church was the “Pope’s House,” in which the Bishop\r\nof Rome was the house-father. He was taught the Creed, the Ten\r\nCommandments, and the Lord’s Prayer. He sang such simple evangelical hymns\r\nas “Ein Kindelein so lobelich,” “Nun bitten wir den heiligen Geist,” and\r\n“Crist ist erstanden.” He was a dreamy, contemplative child; and the\r\nunseen world was never out of his thoughts. He knew that some of the\r\nminers practised sorcery in dark corners below the earth. He feared an old\r\nwoman who lived near; she was a witch, and the priest himself was afraid\r\nof her. He was taught about Hell and Purgatory and the Judgment to come.\r\nHe shivered whenever he looked at the stained-glass window in the parish\r\nchurch and saw the frowning face of Jesus, who, seated on a rainbow and\r\nwith a flaming sword in His hand, was coming to judge him, he knew not\r\nwhen. He saw the crowds of pilgrims who streamed past Mansfeld, carrying\r\ntheir crucifixes high, and chanting their pilgrim songs, going to the\r\nBruno Quertfort chapel or to the old church at Wimmelberg. He saw\r\nparalytics and maimed folk carried along the roads, going to embrace the\r\nwooden cross at Kyffhaüser, and find a miraculous cure; and sick people on\r\ntheir way to the cloister church at Wimmelberg to be cured by the sound of\r\nthe blessed bells.\r\n\r\nThe boy Luther went to the village school in Mansfeld, and endured the\r\ncruelties of a merciless pedagogue. He was sent for a year, in 1497, to a\r\nschool of the Brethren of the Common Lot in Magdeburg. Then he went to St.\r\nGeorge’s school in Eisenach, where he remained three years. He was a “poor\r\nscholar,” which meant a boy who received his lodging and education free,\r\nwas obliged to sing in the church choir, and was allowed to sing in the\r\nstreets, begging for food. The whole town was under the spell of St.\r\nElizabeth, the pious landgravine, who had given up family life and all\r\nearthly comforts to earn a mediæval saintship. It contained nine\r\nmonasteries and nunneries, many of them dating back to the days of St.\r\nElizabeth; her good deeds were emblazoned on the windows of the church in\r\nwhich Luther sang as choir-boy; he had long conversations with the monks\r\nwho belonged to her foundations. The boy was being almost insensibly\r\nattracted to that revival of the mediæval religious life which was the\r\npopular religious force of these days. He had glimpses of the old homely\r\nevangelical piety, this time accompanied by a refinement of manners Luther\r\nhad hitherto been unacquainted with, in the house of a lady who is\r\nidentified by biographers with a certain Frau Cotta. The boy enjoyed it\r\nintensely, and his naturally sunny nature expanded under its influence.\r\nBut it did not touch him religiously. He has recorded that it was with\r\nincredulous surprise that he heard his hostess say that there was nothing\r\non earth more lovely than the love of husband and wife, when it is in the\r\nfear of the Lord.\r\n\r\nAfter three years’ stay at Eisenach, Luther entered the University of\r\nErfurt (1501), then the most famous in Germany. It had been founded in\r\n1392 by the burghers of the town, who were intensely proud of their own\r\nUniversity, and especially of the fact that it had far surpassed other\r\nseats of learning which owed their origin to princes. The academic and\r\nburgher life were allied at Erfurt as they were in no other University\r\ntown. The days of graduation were always town holidays, and at the\r\ngraduation processions the officials of the city walked with the\r\nUniversity authorities. Luther tells us that when he first saw the newly\r\nmade graduates marching in their new graduation robes in the middle of the\r\nprocession, he thought that they had attained to the summit of earthly\r\nfelicity. The University of Erfurt was also strictly allied to the Church.\r\nDifferent Popes had enriched it with privileges; the Primate of Germany,\r\nthe Archbishop of Mainz, was its Chancellor: many of its professors held\r\necclesiastical prebends, or were monks; each faculty was under the\r\nprotection of a tutelary saint; the teachers had to swear to teach nothing\r\nopposed to the doctrines of the Roman Church; and special pains were taken\r\nto prevent the rise and spread of heresy.\r\n\r\nIts students were exposed to a greater variety of influences than those of\r\nany other seat of learning in Germany. Its theology represented the more\r\nmodern type of scholastic, the Scotist; its philosophy was the nominalist\r\nteaching of William of Occam, whose great disciple, Gabriel Biel (d.\r\n1495), had been one of its most celebrated professors; the system of\r\nbiblical interpretation, first introduced by Nicholas de Lyra(132) (d.\r\n1340), had been long taught at Erfurt by a succession of able masters;\r\nHumanism had won an early entrance, and in Luther’s time the Erfurt circle\r\nof “Poets” was already famous. The strongly anti-clerical teaching of John\r\nof Wessel, who had lectured in Erfurt for fifteen years (1445-1460), had\r\nleft its mark on the University, and was not forgotten. Hussite\r\npropagandists, Luther tells us, appeared from time to time, whispering\r\namong the students their strange, anti-clerical Christian socialism.\r\nWhile, as if by way of antidote, there came Papal Legates, whose\r\nmagnificence bore witness to the might of the Roman Church.\r\n\r\nLuther had been sent to Erfurt to learn Law, and the Faculty of Philosophy\r\ngave the preliminary training required. The young student worked hard at\r\nthe prescribed tasks. The Scholastic Philosophy, he said, left him little\r\ntime for classical studies, and he attended none of the Humanist lectures.\r\nHe found time, however, to read a good many Latin authors privately, and\r\nalso to learn something of Greek. Virgil and Plautus were his favourite\r\nauthors; Cicero also charmed him; he read Livy, Terence, and Horace. He\r\nseems also to have read a volume of selections from Propertius, Persius,\r\nLucretius, Tibullus, Silvius Italicus, Statius, and Claudian. But he was\r\nnever a member of the Humanist circle; he was too much in earnest about\r\nreligious questions, and of too practical a turn of mind.\r\n\r\nThe scanty accounts of Luther’s student days show that he was a\r\nhardworking, bright, sociable youth, and musical to the core. His\r\ncompanions called him “the Philosopher,” “the Musician,” and spoke of his\r\nlute-playing, of his singing, and of his ready power in debate. He took\r\nhis various degrees in unusually short time. He was Bachelor in 1502, and\r\nMaster in 1505. His father, proud of his son’s success, had sent him the\r\ncostly present of a _Corpus Juris_. He may have begun to attend the\r\nlectures in the Faculty of Law, when he suddenly plunged into the Erfurt\r\nConvent of the Augustinian Eremites.\r\n\r\nThe action was so sudden and unexpected, that contemporaries felt bound to\r\ngive all manner of explanations, and these have been woven together into\r\naccounts which are legendary.(133) Luther himself has told us that he\r\nentered the monastery because he _doubted of himself_; that in his case\r\nthe proverb was true, “Doubt makes a monk.” He also said that his resolve\r\nwas a sudden one, because he knew that his decision would grieve his\r\nfather and his mother.\r\n\r\nWhat was the doubting? We are tempted in these days to think of\r\nintellectual difficulties, and Luther’s doubting is frequently attributed\r\nto the self-questioning which his contact with Humanism at Erfurt had\r\nengendered. But this idea, if not foreign to the age, was strange to\r\nLuther. His was a simple pious nature, practical rather than speculative,\r\nsensitive and imaginative. He could play with abstract questions; but it\r\nwas pictures that compelled him to action. He has left on record a series\r\nof pictures which were making deeper and more permanent impression on him\r\nas the years passed; they go far to reveal the history of his struggles,\r\nand to tell us what the doubts were which drove him into the convent. The\r\npicture on the window in Mansfeld church of Jesus sitting on a rainbow,\r\nwith frowning countenance and drawn sword in His hand, coming to judge the\r\nwicked; the altar-piece at Magdeburg representing a great ship sailing\r\nheavenwards, no one within the ship but priests or monks, and in the sea\r\nlaymen drowning, or saved by ropes thrown to them by the priests and monks\r\nwho were safe on board; the living picture of the prince of Anhalt, who to\r\nsave his soul had become a friar, and carried the begging sack on his bent\r\nshoulders through the streets of Magdeburg; the history of St. Elizabeth\r\nblazoned on the windows of the church at Eisenach; the young Carthusian at\r\nEisenach, who the boy thought was the holiest man he had ever talked to,\r\nand who had so mortified his body that he had come to look like a very old\r\nman; the terrible deathbed scene of the Erfurt ecclesiastical dignitary, a\r\nman who held twenty-two benefices, and whom Luther had often seen riding\r\nin state in the great processions, who was known to be an evil-liver, and\r\nwho when he came to die filled the room with his frantic cries. Luther\r\ndoubted whether he could ever do what he believed had to be done by him to\r\nsave his soul if he remained in the world. That was what compelled him to\r\nbecome a monk, and bury himself in the convent. The lurid fires of Hell\r\nand the pale shades of Purgatory, which are the permanent background to\r\nDante’s Paradise, were present to Luther’s mind from childhood. Could he\r\nescape the one and gain entrance to the other if he remained in the world?\r\nHe doubted it, and entered the convent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 3. Luther in the Erfurt Convent.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was a convent of the Augustinian Eremites, perhaps the most highly\r\nesteemed of monastic orders by the common people of Germany during the\r\nearlier decades of the sixteenth century. They represented the very best\r\ntype of that superstitious mediæval revival which has been already\r\ndescribed.(134) It is a mistake to suppose that because they bore the name\r\nof Augustine, the evangelical theology of the great Western Father was\r\nknown to them. Their leading theologians belonged to another and very\r\ndifferent school. The two teachers of theology in the Erfurt convent, when\r\nLuther entered in 1505, were John Genser of Paltz, and John Nathin of\r\nNeuenkirchen. The former was widely known from his writings in favour of\r\nthe strictest form of papal absolutism, of the doctrine of _Attrition_,\r\nand of the efficacy of papal _Indulgences_. It is not probable that Luther\r\nwas one of his pupils; for he retired broken in health and burdened with\r\nold age in 1507.(135) The latter, though unknown beyond the walls of the\r\nconvent, was an able and severe master. He was an ardent admirer of\r\nGabriel Biel, of Peter d’Ailly, and of William of Occam their common\r\nmaster. He thought little of any independent study of the Holy Scriptures.\r\n“Brother Martin,” he once said to Luther, “let the Bible alone; read the\r\nold teachers; they give you the whole marrow of the Bible; reading the\r\nBible simply breeds unrest.”(136) Afterwards he commanded Luther on his\r\ncanonical obedience to refrain from Bible study.(137) It was he who made\r\nLuther read and re-read the writings of Biel, d’Ailly, and Occam, until he\r\nhad committed to memory long passages; and who taught the Reformer to\r\nconsider Occam “his dear Master.” Nathin was a determined opponent of the\r\nReformation until his death in 1529; but Luther always spoke of him with\r\nrespect, and said that he was “a Christian man in spite of his monk’s\r\ncowl.”\r\n\r\nLuther had not come to the convent to study theology; he had entered it to\r\nsave his soul. These studies were part of the convent discipline; to\r\nengage in them, part of his vow of obedience. He worked hard at them, and\r\npleased his superiors greatly; worked because he was a submissive monk.\r\nThey left a deeper impress on him than most of his biographers have cared\r\nto acknowledge. He had more of the Schoolman in him and less of the\r\nHumanist than any other of the men who stood in the first line of leaders\r\nin the Reformation movement. Some of his later doctrines, and especially\r\nhis theory of the Sacrament of the Supper, came to him from these convent\r\nstudies in d’Ailly and Occam. But in his one great quest—how to save his\r\nsoul, how to win the sense of God’s pardon—they were more a hindrance than\r\na help. His teachers might be Augustinian Eremites, but they had not the\r\nfaintest knowledge of Augustinian experimental theology. They belonged to\r\nthe most pelagianising school of mediæval Scholastic; and their last word\r\nalways was that man must work out his own salvation. Luther tried to work\r\nit out in the most approved later mediæval fashion, by the strictest\r\nasceticism. He fasted and scourged himself; he practised all the ordinary\r\nforms of maceration, and invented new ones; but all to no purpose. For\r\nwhen an awakened soul, as he said long afterwards, seeks to find rest in\r\nwork-righteousness, it stands on a foundation of loose sand which it feels\r\nrunning and travelling beneath it; and it must go from one good work to\r\nanother and to another, and so on without end. Luther was undergoing all\r\nunconsciously the experience of Augustine, and what tortured and terrified\r\nthe great African was torturing him. He had learned that man’s goodness is\r\nnot to be measured by his neighbour’s but by God’s, and that man’s sin is\r\nnot to be weighed against the sins of his neighbours, but against the\r\nrighteousness of God. His theological studies told him that God’s pardon\r\ncould be had through the Sacrament of Penance, and that the first part of\r\nthat sacrament was sorrow for sin. But then came a difficulty. The older,\r\nand surely the better theology, explained that this godly sorrow\r\n(_contritio_) must be based on love to God. Had he this love? God always\r\nappeared to him as an implacable Judge, inexorably threatening punishment\r\nfor the breaking of a law which it seemed impossible to keep. He had to\r\nconfess to himself that he sometimes almost hated this arbitrary Will\r\nwhich the nominalist Schoolmen called God. The more modern theology, that\r\ntaught by the chief convent theologian, John of Paltz, asserted that the\r\nsorrow might be based on meaner motives (_attritio_), and that this\r\nattrition was changed into contrition in the Sacrament of Penance itself.\r\nSo Luther wearied his superiors by his continual use of this sacrament.\r\nThe slightest breach of the most trifling conventual regulation was looked\r\non as a sin, and had to be confessed at once and absolution for it\r\nreceived, until the perplexed lad was ordered to cease confession until he\r\nhad committed some sin worth confessing. His brethren believed him to be a\r\nmiracle of piety. They boasted about him in their monkish fashion, and in\r\nall the monasteries around, and as far away as Grimma, the monks and nuns\r\ntalked about the young saint in the Erfurt convent. Meanwhile the “young\r\nsaint” himself lived a life of mental anguish, whispering to himself that\r\nhe was “gallows-ripe.” Writing in 1518, years after the conflict was over,\r\nLuther tells us that no pen could describe the mental anguish he\r\nendured.(138) Gleams of comfort came to him, but they were transient. The\r\nMaster of the Novices gave him salutary advice; an aged brother gave him\r\nmomentary comfort. John Staupitz, the Vicar-General of the Congregation,\r\nduring his visits to the convent was attracted by the traces of hidden\r\nconflicts and sincere endeavour of the young monk, with his high\r\ncheek-bones, emaciated frame, gleaming eyes, and looks of settled despair.\r\nHe tried to find out his difficulties. He revoked Nathin’s order that\r\nLuther should not read the Scriptures. He encouraged him to read the\r\nBible; he gave him a _Glossa Ordinaria_ or conventual ecclesiastical\r\ncommentary, where passages were explained by quotations from eminent\r\nChurch Fathers, and difficulties were got over by much pious allegorising;\r\nabove all, he urged him to become a good _localis_ and _textualis_ in the\r\nBible, _i.e._ one who, when he met with difficulties, did not content\r\nhimself with commentaries, but made collections of parallel passages for\r\nhimself, and found explanations of one in the others. Still this brought\r\nat first little help. At last Staupitz saw the young man’s real\r\ndifficulty, and gave him real and lasting assistance. He showed Luther\r\nthat he had been rightly enough contrasting man’s sin and God’s holiness,\r\nand measuring the depth of the one by the height of the other; that he had\r\nbeen following the truest instincts of the deepest piety when he had set\r\nover-against each other the righteousness of God and the sin and\r\nhelplessness of man; but that he had gone wrong when he kept these two\r\nthoughts in a _permanent_ opposition. He then explained that, according to\r\nGod’s promise, the righteousness of God might become man’s own possession\r\nin and through Christ Jesus. God had promised that man could have\r\nfellowship with Him; all fellowship is founded on personal trust; and\r\ntrust, the personal trust of the believing man on a personal God who has\r\npromised, gives man that fellowship with God through which all things that\r\nbelong to God can become his. Without this personal trust or faith, all\r\ndivine things, the Incarnation and Passion of the Saviour, the Word and\r\nthe Sacraments, however true as matters of fact, are outside man and\r\ncannot be truly possessed. But when man trusts God and His promises, and\r\nwhen the fellowship, which trust or faith always creates, is once\r\nestablished, then they can be truly possessed by the man who trusts. The\r\njust live by their faith. These thoughts, acted upon, helped Luther\r\ngradually to win his way to peace, and he told Staupitz long afterwards\r\nthat it was he who had made him see the rays of light which dispelled the\r\ndarkness of his soul.(139) In the end, the vision of the true relation of\r\nthe believing man to God came to him suddenly with all the force of a\r\npersonal revelation, and the storm-tossed soul was at rest. The sudden\r\nenlightenment, the personal revelation which was to change his whole life,\r\ncame to him when he was reading the _Epistle to the Romans_ in his cell.\r\nIt came to Paul when he was riding on the road to Damascus; to Augustine\r\nas he was lying under a fig-tree in the Milan garden; to Francis as he\r\npaced anxiously the flag-stones of the Portiuncula chapel on the plain\r\nbeneath Assisi; to Suso as he sat at table in the morning. It spoke\r\nthrough different words:—to Paul, “Why persecutest thou Me?”;(140) to\r\nAugustine, “Put ye on the Lord Jesus Christ, and make not provision for\r\nthe flesh”;(141) to Francis, “Get you no gold, nor silver, nor brass in\r\nyour purses, no wallet for your journey, neither two coats, nor shoes, nor\r\nstaff”;(142) to Suso, “My son, if thou wilt hear My words.”(143) But\r\nthough the words were different, the personal revelation, which mastered\r\nthe men, was the same: That trust in the All-merciful God, who has\r\nrevealed Himself in Jesus Christ, creates companionship with God, and that\r\nall other things are nothing in comparison with this fellowship. It was\r\nthis contact with the Unseen which fitted Luther for his task as the\r\nleader of men in an age which was longing for a revival of moral living\r\ninspired by a fresh religious impulse.(144)\r\n\r\nIt is not certain how long Luther’s protracted struggle lasted. There are\r\nindications that it went on for two years, and that he did not attain to\r\ninward peace until shortly before he was sent to Wittenberg in 1508. The\r\nintensity and sincerity of the conflict marked him for life. The\r\nconviction that he, weak and sinful as he was, nevertheless lived in\r\npersonal fellowship with the God whose love he was experiencing, became\r\nthe one fundamental fact of life on which he, a human personality, could\r\ntake his stand as on a foundation of rock; and standing on it, feeling his\r\nown strength, he could also be a source of strength to others. Everything\r\nelse, however venerable and sacred it might once have seemed, might prove\r\nuntrustworthy without hereafter disturbing Luther’s religious life,\r\nprovided only this one thing remained to him. For the moment, however,\r\nnothing seemed questionable. The inward change altered nothing external.\r\nHe still believed that the Church was the “Pope’s House”; he accepted all\r\nits usages and institutions—its Masses and its relics, its indulgences and\r\nits pilgrimages, its hierarchy and its monastic life. He was still a monk\r\nand believed in his vocation.\r\n\r\nLuther’s theological studies were continued. He devoted himself especially\r\nto Bernard, in whose sermons on the _Song of Solomon_ he found the same\r\nthoughts of the relation of the believing soul to God which had given him\r\ncomfort. He began to show himself a good man of business with an eye to\r\nthe heart of things. Staupitz and his chiefs entrusted him with some\r\ndelicate commissions on behalf of the Order, and made quiet preparations\r\nfor his advancement. In 1508 he, with a few other monks, was sent from\r\nErfurt to the smaller convent at Wittenberg, to assist the small\r\nUniversity there.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 4. Luther’s early Life in Wittenberg.\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout the beginning of the century, Frederick the Wise, Elector of Saxony\r\nand head of the Ernestine branch of his family, had resolved to establish\r\na University for his dominions. Frederick had maintained close relations\r\nwith the Augustinian Eremites ever since he had made acquaintance with\r\nthem when a schoolboy at Grimma, and the Vicar-General, John Staupitz,\r\nalong with Dr. Pollich of Mellerstadt, were his chief advisers. It might\r\nalmost be said that the new University was, from the beginning, an\r\neducational establishment belonging to the Order of monks which Luther had\r\njoined. Staupitz himself was one of the professors, and Dean of the\r\nFaculty of Theology; another Augustinian Eremite was Dean of the Faculty\r\nof Arts; the Patron Saints of the Order of the Blessed Virgin and St.\r\nAugustine were the Patron Saints of the University; St. Paul was the\r\nPatron Saint of the Faculty of Theology, and on the day of his conversion\r\nthere was a special celebration of the Mass with a sermon, at which the\r\nRector (Dr. Pollich) and the whole teaching staff were present.\r\n\r\nThe University was poorly endowed. Electoral Saxony was not a rich\r\nprincipality; some mining industry did exist in the south end, and Zwickau\r\nwas the centre of a great weaving trade; but the great proportion of the\r\ninhabitants, whether of villages or towns, subsisted on agriculture of a\r\npoor kind. There was not much money at the Electoral court. A sum got from\r\nthe sale of Indulgences some years before, which Frederick had not allowed\r\nto leave the country, served to make a beginning. The prebends attached to\r\nthe Church of All Saints (the Castle Church) supplied the salaries of some\r\nprofessors; the others were Augustinian Eremites, who gave their services\r\ngratuitously.\r\n\r\nThe town of Wittenberg was more like a large village than the capital of a\r\nprincipality. In 1513 it only contained 3000 inhabitants and 356 rateable\r\nhouses. The houses were for the most part mean wooden dwellings, roughly\r\nplastered with clay. The town lay in the very centre of Germany, but it\r\nwas far from any of the great trade routes; the inhabitants had a good\r\ndeal of Wendish blood in their veins, and were inclined to be sluggish and\r\nintemperate. The environs were not picturesque, and the surrounding\r\ncountry had a poor soil. Altogether it was scarcely the place for a\r\nUniversity. Imperial privileges were obtained from the Emperor Maximilian,\r\nand the University was opened on the 18th of October 1502.\r\n\r\nOne or two eminent teachers had been induced to come to the new\r\nUniversity. Staupitz collected promising young monks from many convents of\r\nhis Order and enrolled them as students, and the University entered 416\r\nnames on its books during its first year. This success seems to have been\r\nsomewhat artificial, for the numbers gradually declined to 56 in the\r\nsummer session of 1505. Staupitz, however, encouraged Frederick to\r\npersevere.\r\n\r\nIt was in the interests of the young University that Luther and a band of\r\nbrother monks were sent from Erfurt to the Wittenberg convent. There he\r\nwas set to teach the Dialectic and Physics of Aristotle,—a hateful\r\ntask,—but whether to the monks in the convent or in the University it is\r\nimpossible to say. All the while Staupitz urged him to study theology in\r\norder to teach it. It was then that Luther began his systematic study of\r\nAugustine. He also began to preach. His first sermons were delivered in an\r\nold chapel, 30 feet long and 20 feet wide, built of wood plastered over\r\nwith clay. He preached to the monks. Dr. Pollich, the Rector, went\r\nsometimes to hear him, and spoke to the Elector of the young monk with\r\npiercing eyes and strange fancies in his head.\r\n\r\nHis work was interrupted by a command to go to Rome on business of his\r\nOrder (autumn 1511). His selection was a great honour, and Luther felt it\r\nto be so; but it may be questioned whether he did not think more of the\r\nfact that he would visit the Holy City as a devout pilgrim, and be able to\r\navail himself of the spiritual privileges which he believed were to be\r\nfound there. When he got to the end of his journey and first caught a\r\nglimpse of the city, he raised his hands in an ecstasy, exclaiming, “I\r\ngreet thee, thou Holy Rome, thrice holy from the blood of the martyrs.”\r\n\r\nWhen his official work was done he set about seeing the Holy City with the\r\ndevotion of a pilgrim. He visited all the famous shrines, especially those\r\nto which Indulgences were attached. He listened reverently to all the\r\naccounts given of the relics which were exhibited to the pilgrims, and\r\nbelieved in all the tales told him. He thought that if his parents had\r\nbeen dead he could have assured them against Purgatory by saying Masses in\r\ncertain chapels. Only once, it is said, his soul showed revolt. He was\r\nslowly climbing on his knees the _Scala Santa_ (really a mediæval\r\nstaircase), said to have been the stone steps leading up to Pilate’s house\r\nin Jerusalem, once trodden by the feet of our Lord; when half-way up the\r\nthought came into his mind, _The just shall live by his faith_; he stood\r\nupright and walked slowly down. He saw, as thousands of pious German\r\npilgrims had done before his time, the moral corruptions which disgraced\r\nthe Holy City—infidel priests who scoffed at the sacred mysteries they\r\nperformed, and princes of the Church who lived in open sin. He saw and\r\nloathed the moral degradation, and the scenes imprinted themselves on his\r\nmemory; but his home and cloister training enabled him, for the time\r\nbeing, in spite of the loathing, to revel in the memorials of the old\r\nheroic martyrs, and to look on their relics as storehouses of divine\r\ngrace. In later days it was the memories of the vices of the Roman Court\r\nthat helped him to harden his heart against the sentiment which surrounded\r\nthe Holy City.\r\n\r\nWhen Luther returned to Wittenberg in the early summer of 1512, his\r\nVicar-General sent him to Erfurt to complete his training for the\r\ndoctorate in theology. He graduated as Doctor of the Holy Scripture, took\r\nthe Wittenberg Doctor’s oath to defend the evangelical truth vigorously\r\n(_viriliter_), was made a member of the Wittenberg Senate, and three weeks\r\nlater succeeded Staupitz as Professor of Theology.\r\n\r\nLuther was still a genuine monk, with no doubt of his vocation. He became\r\nsub-prior of the Wittenberg convent in 1512, and was made the District\r\nVicar over the eleven convents in Meissen and Thuringia in 1515. But that\r\nside of his life may be passed over. It is his theological work as\r\nprofessor in Wittenberg University that is important for his career as a\r\nreformer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 5. Luther’s early Lectures in Theology.\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom the beginning his lectures on theology differed from those ordinarily\r\ngiven, but not because he had any theological opinions at variance with\r\nthose of his old teachers at Erfurt. No one attributed any sort of\r\nheretical views to the young Wittenberg professor. His mind was intensely\r\npractical, and he believed that theology might be made useful to guide men\r\nto find the grace of God and to tell them how, having acquired through\r\ntrust a sense of fellowship with God, they could persevere in a life of\r\njoyous obedience to God and His commandments. The Scholastic theologians\r\nof Erfurt and elsewhere did not look on theology as a practical discipline\r\nof this kind. Luther thought that theology ought to discuss such matters,\r\nand he knew that his main interest in theology lay on this practical side.\r\nBesides, as he has told us, he regarded himself as specially set apart to\r\nlecture on the Holy Scriptures. So, like John Colet, he began by\r\nexpounding the Epistles of St. Paul and the Psalms.\r\n\r\nLuther never knew much Hebrew, and he used the Vulgate in his prelections.\r\nHe had a huge widely printed volume on his desk, and wrote out the heads\r\nof his lectures between the printed lines. Some of the pages still survive\r\nin the Wolfenbüttel Library, and can be studied.(145)\r\n\r\nHe made some use of the commentaries of Nicholas de Lyra, but got most\r\nassistance from passages in Augustine, Bernard, and Gerson,(146) which\r\ndealt with practical religion,(147) His lectures were experimental. He\r\nstarted with the fact of man’s sin, the possibility of reaching a sense of\r\npardon and of fellowship with God through trust in His promises. From the\r\nbeginning we find in the germ what grew to be the main thoughts in the\r\nlater Lutheran theology. Men are redeemed apart from any merits of their\r\nown; God’s grace is really His mercy revealed in the mission and work of\r\nChrist; it has to do with the forgiveness of sins, and is the fulfilment\r\nof His promises; man’s faith is trust in the historical work of Christ and\r\nin the verity of God. These thoughts were for the most part all expressed\r\nin the formal language of the Scholastic Theology of the day. They grew in\r\nclearness, and took shape in a series of propositions which formed the\r\ncommon basis of his teaching: man wins pardon through the free grace of\r\nGod: when man lays hold on God’s promise of pardon he becomes a new\r\ncreature; this sense of pardon is the beginning of a new life of\r\nsanctification; the life of faith is Christianity on its inward side; the\r\ncontrast between the law and the gospel is something fundamental: there is\r\na real distinction between the outward and visible Church and the ideal\r\nChurch, which latter is to be described by its spiritual and moral\r\nrelations to God after the manner of Augustine. All these thoughts simply\r\npushed aside the ordinary theology as taught in the schools without\r\nstaying to criticise it.\r\n\r\nIn the years 1515 and 1516, which bear traces of a more thoroughgoing\r\nstudy of Augustine and of the German mediæval Mystics, Luther began to\r\nfind that he could not express the thoughts he desired to convey in the\r\nordinary language of Scholastic Theology, and that its phrases suggested\r\nideas other than those he wished to set forth. He tried to find another\r\nset of expressions. It is characteristic of Luther’s conservatism, that in\r\ntheological phraseology, as afterwards in ecclesiastical institutions and\r\nceremonies, he preferred to retain what had been in use provided only he\r\ncould put his own evangelical meaning into it in a not too arbitrary\r\nway.(148) Having found that the Scholastic phraseology did not always suit\r\nhis purpose, he turned to the popular mystical authors, and discovered\r\nthere a rich store of phrases in which he could express his ideas of the\r\nimperfection of man towards what is good. Along with this change in\r\nlanguage, and related to it, we find evidence that Luther was beginning to\r\nthink less highly of the monastic life with its _external_ renunciations.\r\nThe thought of predestination, meaning by that not an abstract\r\nmetaphysical category, but the conception that the whole believer’s life,\r\nand what it involved, depended in the last resort on God and not on man,\r\ncame more and more into the foreground. Still there does not seem any\r\ndisposition to criticise or to repudiate the current theology of the day.\r\n\r\nThe earliest traces of _conscious_ opposition appeared about the middle of\r\n1516, and characteristically on the practical and not on the speculative\r\nside of theology. They began in a sermon on Indulgences, preached in July\r\n1516. Once begun, the breach widened until Luther could contrast “our\r\ntheology”(149) (the theology taught by Luther and his colleagues at\r\nWittenberg) with what was taught elsewhere, and notably at Erfurt. The\r\nformer represented Augustine and the Holy Scriptures, and the latter was\r\nfounded on Aristotle. In September 1517 he raised the standard of\r\ntheological revolt, and wrote directly against the “Scholastic Theology”;\r\nhe declared that it was Pelagian at heart, and buried out of sight the\r\nAugustinian doctrines of grace; he lamented the fact that it neglected to\r\nteach the supreme value of faith and of inward righteousness; that it\r\nencouraged men to seek escape from what was due for sin by means of\r\nIndulgences, instead of exhorting them to practise the inward repentance\r\nwhich belongs to every genuine Christian life.\r\n\r\nIt was at this interesting stage of his own religious development that\r\nLuther felt himself forced to oppose publicly the sale of Indulgences in\r\nGermany.\r\n\r\nBy the year 1517, Luther had become a power in Wittenberg both as a\r\npreacher and as a teacher. He had become the preacher in the town church,\r\nfrom whose pulpit he delivered many sermons every week, taking infinite\r\npains to make himself understood by the “raw Saxons.” He became a great\r\npreacher, and, like all great preachers, he denounced prevalent sins, and\r\nbewailed the low standard of morals set before the people by the higher\r\necclesiastical authorities; he said that religion was not an easy thing;\r\nthat it did not consist in the decent performance of external ceremonies;\r\nthat the sense of sin, the experience of the grace of God, and the fear of\r\nGod and the overcoming of that fear through the love of God, were all\r\ncontinuous experiences.\r\n\r\nHis exegetical lectures seemed like a rediscovery of the Holy Scriptures.\r\nGrave burghers of Wittenberg matriculated as students in order to hear\r\nthem. The fame of the lecturer spread, and students from all parts of\r\nGermany crowded to the small remote University, until the Elector became\r\nproud of his seat of learning and of the man who had made it prosper.\r\n\r\nSuch a man could not keep silent when he saw what he believed to be a\r\ngrave source of moral evil approaching the people whose souls God had\r\ngiven him in charge; and this is how Luther came to be a Reformer.\r\n\r\nUp to this time he had been an obedient monk, doing diligently the work\r\ngiven him, highly esteemed by his superiors, fulfilling the expectations\r\nof his Vicar-General, and recognised by all as a quiet and eminently pious\r\nman. He had a strong, simple character, with nothing of the quixotic about\r\nhim. Of course he saw the degradation of much of the religious life of the\r\ntimes, and had attended at least one meeting where those present discussed\r\nplans of reformation. He had then (at Leitzkau in 1512) declared that\r\nevery true reformation must begin with individual men, that it must reveal\r\nitself in a regenerate heart aflame with faith kindled by the preaching of\r\na pure gospel.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 6. The Indulgence-seller.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat drew Luther from his retirement was an Indulgence proclaimed by Pope\r\nLeo X., farmed by Albert of Brandenburg, the Archbishop of Mainz, and\r\npreached by John Tetzel, a Dominican monk, who had been commissioned by\r\nAlbert to sell for him the _Papal Letters_, as the Indulgence tickets were\r\ncalled. It had been announced that the money raised by the sales would be\r\nused to build the Basilica of St. Peter to be a tomb worthy of the great\r\nApostle, who rested, it was said, in a Roman grave.\r\n\r\nThe Indulgence-seller had usually a magnificent reception when he entered\r\na German town. Frederick Mecum (Myconius), who was an eye-witness, thus\r\ndescribes the entrance of Tetzel into the town of Annaberg in Ducal\r\nSaxony:\r\n\r\n\r\n    “When the Commissary or Indulgence-seller approached the town, the\r\n    Bull (proclaiming the Indulgence) was carried before him on a\r\n    cloth of velvet and gold, and all the priests and monks, the town\r\n    council, the schoolmasters and their scholars, and all the men and\r\n    women went out to meet him with banners and candles and songs,\r\n    forming a great procession; then all the bells ringing and all the\r\n    organs playing, they accompanied him to the principal church; a\r\n    red cross was set up in the midst of the church, and the Pope’s\r\n    banner was displayed; in short, one might think they were\r\n    receiving God Himself.”\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Commissary then preached a sermon extolling the Indulgence, declaring\r\nthat “the gate of heaven was open,” and that the sales would begin.\r\n\r\nMany German princes had no great love for the Indulgence-sellers, and\r\nFrederick, the Elector of Saxony, had prohibited Tetzel from entering his\r\nterritories. But the lands of Ernestine (Electoral) and Albertine (Ducal)\r\nSaxony were so mixed up that it was easy for the Commissary to command the\r\nwhole population of Electoral Saxony without actually crossing the\r\nfrontier. The “Red Cross” had been set up in Zerbst in Ducal Saxony a few\r\nmiles to the west, and at Jüterbogk in the territory of Magdeburg a few\r\nmiles to the east of Wittenberg, and people had gone from the town to buy\r\nthe Indulgence. Luther believed that the sales were injurious to the moral\r\nand religious life of his townsmen; the reports of the sermons and\r\naddresses of the Indulgence-seller which reached him appeared to contain\r\nwhat he believed to be both lies and blasphemies. He secured a copy of the\r\nletter of recommendation given by the Archbishop to his Commissary, and\r\nhis indignation grew stronger. Still it was only after much hesitation,\r\nafter many of his friends had urged him to interfere, and in deep distress\r\nof mind, that he resolved to protest. When he had determined to do\r\nsomething he went about the matter with a mixture of caution and courage\r\nwhich were characteristic of the man.\r\n\r\nThe Church of All Saints (the Castle Church) in Wittenberg had always been\r\nintimately connected with the University; its prebendaries were\r\nprofessors; its doors were used as a board on which to publish important\r\nacademic documents; and notices of public academic “disputations,” common\r\nenough at the time, had frequently appeared there. The day of the year\r\nwhich drew the largest concourse of townsmen and strangers to the church\r\nwas All Saints’ Day, the first of November. It was the anniversary of the\r\nconsecration of the building, and was commemorated by a prolonged series\r\nof services. The Elector Frederick was a great collector of relics, and\r\nhad stored his collection in the church.(150) He had also procured an\r\nIndulgence to benefit all who came to attend the anniversary services and\r\nlook at the relics.\r\n\r\nOn All Saints’ Day, Luther nailed his Ninety-five Theses to the door of\r\nthe church. It was a strictly academic proceeding. The Professor of\r\nTheology in Wittenberg, wishing to elucidate the truth, offered to\r\ndiscuss, either by speech or by writing, the matter of Indulgences.(151)\r\nHe put forth ninety-five propositions or heads of discussion which he\r\nproposed to maintain. Academic etiquette was strictly preserved; the\r\nsubject, judged by the numberless books which had been written on it, and\r\nthe variety of opinions expressed, was eminently suitable for debate; the\r\nTheses were offered as subjects of debate; and the author, according to\r\nthe usage of the time in such cases, was not supposed to be definitely\r\ncommitted to the opinions expressed.\r\n\r\nThe Theses, however, differed from most programmes of academic discussions\r\nin this, that everyone wanted to read them. A duplicate was made in\r\nGerman. Copies of the Latin original and the translation were sent to the\r\nUniversity printing-house, and the presses could not throw them off fast\r\nenough to meet the demand which came from all parts of Germany.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter II. From The Beginning of the Indulgence Controversy to the Diet\r\nof Worms.(152)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 1. The Theory and Practice of Indulgences in the Sixteenth Century.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe practice of _Indulgences_ pervaded the whole penitential system of the\r\nlater mediæval Church, and had done so from the beginning of the\r\nthirteenth century. Its beginnings go back a thousand years before\r\nLuther’s time.\r\n\r\nIn the ancient Church, lapse into serious sin involved separation from the\r\nChristian fellowship, and readmission to communion was only to be had by\r\npublic confession made in presence of the whole congregation, and by the\r\nmanifestation of a true repentance in performing certain\r\n_satisfactions_,(153) such as the manumission of slaves, prolonged\r\nfasting, extensive almsgiving, etc. These _satisfactions_ were the open\r\nsigns of heartfelt sorrow, and were regarded as at once well-pleasing to\r\nGod and evidence to the Christian community that the penitent had true\r\nrepentance, and might be received back again into their midst. The\r\nconfession was made to the whole congregation; the amount of\r\n_satisfaction_ deemed necessary was estimated by the congregation, and\r\nreadmission was also dependent on the will of the whole congregation. It\r\noften happened that these _satisfactions_ were mitigated or exchanged for\r\nothers. The penitent might fall sick, and the fasting which had been\r\nprescribed could not be insisted upon without danger of death; in such a\r\ncase the external sign of sorrow which had been demanded might be\r\nexchanged for another. Or it might happen that the community became\r\nconvinced of the sincerity of the repentance without insisting that the\r\nwhole of the prescribed _satisfaction_ need be performed.(154) These\r\nexchanges and mitigations of _satisfactions_ were the small beginnings of\r\nthe later system of Indulgences.\r\n\r\nIn course of time the public confession of sins made to the whole\r\ncongregation was exchanged for a private confession made to the priest,\r\nand instead of the public _satisfaction_ imposed by the whole\r\ncongregation, it was left to the priest to enjoin a _satisfaction_ or\r\nexternal sign of sorrow which he believed was appropriate to the sin\r\ncommitted and confessed. The substitution of a private confession to the\r\npriest for a public confession made to the whole congregation, enlarged\r\nthe circle of sins confessed. The _secret_ sins of the heart whose\r\npresence could be elicited by the questions of the confessor were added to\r\nthe open sins seen of men. The circle of _satisfactions_ was also widened\r\nin a corresponding fashion.\r\n\r\nWhen the imposition of _satisfactions_ was left in the hands of the\r\npriest, it was felt necessary to provide some check against the\r\narbitrariness which could not fail to result. So books were published\r\ncontaining lists of sins with the corresponding appropriate\r\n_satisfactions_ which ought to be demanded from the penitents. If it be\r\nremembered that some of the sins mentioned were very heinous (murders,\r\nincests, outrages of all kinds), it is not surprising that the appropriate\r\n_satisfactions_ or _penances_, as they came to be called, were very severe\r\nin some cases, and extended over a course of years. From the seventh\r\ncentury there arose a practice of commuting _satisfactions_ or penances. A\r\npenance of several years’ practice of fasting might be commuted into\r\nsaying so many prayers or psalms, into giving a definite amount of alms,\r\nor even into a money fine—and in this last case the analogy of the\r\n_Wehrgeld_ of the Germanic tribal codes was frequently followed.(155)\r\nThese customary commutations were frequently inserted in the\r\n_Penitentiaries_ or books of discipline. This new custom commonly took the\r\nform that the penitent, who visited a certain church on a prescribed day\r\nand gave a contribution to its funds, had the penance, which had been\r\nimposed upon him by the priest in the ordinary course of discipline,\r\nshortened by one-seventh, one-third, one-half, as the case might be. This\r\nwas in every case the commutation or relaxation of the penance or outward\r\nsign of sorrow which had been imposed according to the regulations of the\r\nChurch, laid down in the _Penitentiaries (relaxatio de injuncta\r\npœnitentia)._ This was the real origin of Indulgences, and these earliest\r\nexamples were invariably a relaxation of ecclesiastical penalties which\r\nhad been imposed according to the regular custom in cases of discipline.\r\nIt will be seen that Luther expressly excluded this kind of Indulgence\r\nfrom his attack. He declared that what the Church had a right to impose,\r\nit had a right to relax. It was at first believed that this right to relax\r\nor commute imposed penances was in the hands of the priests who had charge\r\nof the discipline of the members of the Church; but the abuses of the\r\nsystem by the priests ended by placing the power to grant Indulgences in\r\nthe hands of the bishops, and they used the money procured in building\r\nmany of the great mediæval cathedrals. Episcopal abuse of Indulgences led\r\nto their being reserved for the Popes.\r\n\r\nThree conceptions, all of which belong to the beginning of the thirteenth\r\ncentury, combined to effect a great change on this old and simple idea of\r\nIndulgences. These were—(1) the formulation of the thought of a _treasury\r\nof merits_ (_thesaurus meritorum_); (2) the change of the _institution_\r\ninto the _Sacrament_ of Penance; and (3) the distinction between\r\n_attrition_ and _contrition_ in the thought of the kind of sorrow God\r\ndemands from a real penitent.\r\n\r\nThe conception of a storehouse of merits (_thesaurus meritorum_ or\r\n_indulgentiarum_) was first formulated by Alexander of Hales(156) in the\r\nthirteenth century, and his ideas were accepted, enlarged, and made more\r\nprecise by succeeding theologians.(157) Starting with the existing\r\npractice in the Church that some penances (such as pilgrimages) might be\r\nvicariously performed, and bringing together the several thoughts that the\r\nfaithful are members of one body, that the good deeds of each of the\r\nmembers are the common property of all, and therefore that the more sinful\r\ncan benefit by the good deeds of their more saintly brethren, and that the\r\nsacrifice of Christ was sufficient to wipe out the sins of all,\r\ntheologians gradually formulated the doctrine that there was a common\r\nstorehouse which contained the good deeds of living men and women, of the\r\nsaints in heaven and the inexhaustible merits of Christ, and that all\r\nthese merits accumulated there had been placed under the charge of the\r\nPope, and could be dispensed by him to the faithful. The doctrine was not\r\nvery precisely defined by the beginning of the sixteenth century, but it\r\nwas generally believed in, taught, and accepted. It went to increase the\r\nvague sense of supernatural, spiritual powers attached to the person of\r\nthe Bishop of Rome. It had one important consequence on the doctrine of\r\nIndulgences. They might be the payment out of this treasury of an absolute\r\nequivalent for the _satisfaction_ due by the penitent for his sins; they\r\nwere no longer merely the substitution of one form of penance for another,\r\nor the relaxation of a penance enjoined.\r\n\r\nThe _institution_ of Penance contained within it the four practices of\r\n_Sorrow_ for the sins committed (_contritio_); the _Confession_ of these\r\nsins to the priest; _Satisfaction_, or the due manifestation of sorrow in\r\nthe ways prescribed by the Church through the command of the confessor;\r\nand the _Pardon_ (_absolutio_) pronounced by the priest in God’s name. The\r\npardon followed the _satisfaction_. But when the _institution_ became the\r\n_Sacrament of Penance_, the order was changed: absolution followed\r\nconfession and came before satisfaction, which it had formerly followed.\r\nSatisfaction lost its old meaning. It was no longer the outward sign of\r\nsorrow and the necessary precedent of pardon or absolution. According to\r\nthe new theory, the absolution which immediately followed confession had\r\nthe effect of removing the whole guilt of the sins confessed, and with the\r\nguilt the whole of the eternal punishment due. This cancelling of guilt\r\nand of eternal punishment did not, however, forthwith open the gates of\r\nheaven to the pardoned sinner. It was felt that the justice of God could\r\nnot permit the baptized sinner to escape from all punishment whatever.\r\nHence it was said that although eternal punishment had disappeared with\r\nthe absolution, there remained temporal punishment due for the sins, and\r\nthat heaven could not be entered until this temporal punishment had been\r\nendured.(158) Temporal punishments might be of two kinds—those endured in\r\nthis life, or those suffered in a place of punishment after death. The\r\npenance imposed by the priest, the satisfaction, now became the temporal\r\npunishment due for sins committed. If the priest had imposed the due\r\namount, and if the penitent was able to perform all that had been imposed,\r\nthe sins were expiated. But if the priest had imposed less than the\r\njustice of God actually demanded, then these temporal pains had to be\r\ncompleted in Purgatory. This gave rise to great uncertainty; for who could\r\nfeel assured that the priest had calculated rightly, and had imposed\r\nsatisfactions or temporal penalties which were of the precise amount\r\ndemanded by the justice of God? Hence the pains of Purgatory threatened\r\nevery man. It was here that the new idea of Indulgences came in to aid the\r\nfaithful by securing him against the pains of Purgatory, which were not\r\nincluded in the absolution obtained in the _Sacrament of Penance_.\r\nIndulgences in the sense of relaxations of imposed penances went into the\r\nbackground, and the really valuable Indulgence was one which, because of\r\nthe merits transferred from the storehouse of merits, was an equivalent in\r\nGod’s sight for the temporal punishments due for sins. Thus, in the\r\nopinion of Alexander of Hales, of Bonaventura,(159) and, above all, of\r\nThomas Aquinas, the real value of Indulgences was that they procured the\r\nremission of penalties due after absolution, whether these penalties were\r\npenances imposed by the priest or not; and when the uncertainty of the\r\nimposed penalties is remembered, the most valuable of all Indulgences were\r\nthose which had regard to the unimposed penalties; the priest might make a\r\nmistake, but God did not blunder.\r\n\r\nWhile Indulgences were always connected with satisfactions, and changed\r\nwith the changes in the meaning of the latter term, they were not the less\r\ninfluenced by a distinction which came to be drawn between _attrition_ and\r\n_contrition_, and by the application of the distinction to the theory of\r\nthe Sacrament of Penance. During the earlier Middle Ages and down to the\r\nthirteenth century, it was always held that _contrition_ (sorrow prompted\r\nby love) was the one thing taken into account by God in pardoning the\r\nsinner. The theologians of the thirteenth century, however, began to draw\r\na distinction between this godly sorrow and a certain amount of sorrow\r\nwhich might arise from a variety of causes of a less worthy nature, and\r\nespecially from servile fear. This was called _attrition_; and it was held\r\nthat this _attrition_, though of itself too imperfect to win the pardon of\r\nGod, might become perfected through the confession heard by the priest,\r\nand in the sacramental absolution pronounced by him. Very naturally,\r\nthough perhaps illogically, it was believed that an imperfect sorrow,\r\nthough sufficient to procure absolution, and, therefore, the blotting out\r\nof eternal punishment, merited more temporal punishment than if it had\r\nbeen sorrow of a godly sort. But it was these temporal penalties\r\n(including the pains of Purgatory) that Indulgences provided for. Hence,\r\nIndulgences appealed more strongly to the indifferent Christian, who knew\r\nthat he had sinned, and at the same time felt that his sorrow was not the\r\neffect of his love to God. He knew that his sins deserved _some_\r\npunishment. His conscience, however weak, told him that he could not sin\r\nwith perfect impunity, and that something more was needed than his\r\nperfunctory confession to a priest. He felt that he must do\r\n_something_—fast, or go on a pilgrimage, or purchase an Indulgence. It was\r\nat this point that the Church intervened to show him how his poor\r\nperformance could be transformed by the power of the Church and its\r\ntreasury of merits into something so great that the penalties of Purgatory\r\ncould be actually evaded. His cheap sorrow, his careless confession, need\r\nnot trouble him. Hence, for the ordinary indifferent Christian,\r\n_Attrition_, _Confession_, and _Indulgence_ became the three heads of the\r\nscheme of the Church for his salvation. The one thing that satisfied his\r\nconscience was the burdensome thing he had to do, and that was to procure\r\nan Indulgence—a matter made increasingly easy for him as time went on.\r\n\r\nIt must not be supposed that this doctrine of _Attrition_, and its evident\r\neffect in deadening the conscience and in lowering the standard of\r\nmorality, had the undivided support of the theologians of the later Middle\r\nAges, but it was the doctrine taught by most of the Scotist theologians,\r\nwho took the lead in theological thinking during these times. It was set\r\nforth in its most extravagant form by such a representative man as John of\r\nPaltz in Erfurt; it was preached by the pardon-sellers; it was eagerly\r\nwelcomed by _indifferent_ Christians, who desired to escape the penalties\r\nof sin without abandoning its enjoyments; it exalted the power of the\r\npriesthood; and it was specially valuable in securing good sales of\r\nIndulgences, and therefore in increasing the papal revenues. It lay at the\r\nbasis of the whole theory and practice of Indulgences, which confronted\r\nLuther when he issued his _Theses_.\r\n\r\nHistory shows us that gross abuses had always gathered round the practice\r\nof Indulgences, even in their earlier and simpler forms. The priests had\r\nabused the system, and the power of issuing Indulgences had been taken\r\nfrom them and confined to the bishops. The bishops, in turn, had abused\r\nthe privilege, and the Popes had gradually assumed that the power to grant\r\nan Indulgence belonged to the Bishop of Rome exclusively, or to those to\r\nwhom he might delegate it; and this assumption seemed both reasonable and\r\nsalutary. The power was at first sparingly used. It is true that Pope\r\nUrban II., in 1095, promised to the Crusaders an Indulgence such as had\r\nnever before been heard of—a complete remission of all imposed canonical\r\npenances; but it was not until the thirteenth and fourteen centuries that\r\nIndulgences, now doubly dangerous to the moral life from the new theories\r\nwhich had arisen, were lavished even more unsparingly than in the days\r\nwhen any bishop had power to grant them. From the beginning of the\r\nfourteenth century they were given to raise recruits for papal wars. They\r\nwere lavished on the religious Orders, either for the benefit of the\r\nmembers or for the purpose of attracting strangers and their gifts to\r\ntheir churches. They were bestowed on cathedrals and other churches, or on\r\nindividual altars in churches, and had the effect of endowments. They were\r\njoined to special collections of relics, to be earned by the faithful who\r\nvisited the shrines. They were given to hospitals, and for the upkeep of\r\nbridges and of roads. Wherever they are met with in the later Middle Ages,\r\nand it would be difficult to say where they are not to be found, they are\r\nseen to be associated with sordid money-getting, and, as Luther remarked\r\nin an early sermon on the subject, they were a very grievous instrument\r\nplaced in the hand of avarice.\r\n\r\nThe practice of granting Indulgences was universally prevalent and was\r\nuniversally accepted; but it was not easy to give an explanation of the\r\nsystem, in the sense of showing that it was an essential element in\r\nChristian discipline. No mediæval theologian attempted to do any such\r\nthing. Bonaventura and Thomas Aquinas, the two great Schoolmen who did\r\nmore than any others to provide a theological basis for the system, tell\r\nus quite frankly that it is their business to accept the fact that\r\nIndulgences do exist as part of the penitentiary discipline of the Church,\r\nand, accepting it, they thought themselves bound to construct a reasonable\r\ntheory.(160) The practice altered, and new theories were needed to explain\r\nthe variations. It is needless to say that these explanations did not\r\nalways agree; and that there were very great differences of opinion about\r\nwhat an Indulgence really effected for the man who bought it.\r\n\r\nOf all these disputed questions the most important was: Did an Indulgence\r\ngive remission for the guilt of sin, or only for certain penalties which\r\nfollowed the sinful deed? This is a question about which modern Romanists\r\nare extremely sensitive.\r\n\r\nThe universal answer given by all defenders of Indulgences who have\r\nwritten on the subject since the Council of Trent, is that guilt (_culpa_)\r\nand eternal punishment (_pœnæ eternæ_) are dealt with in the Sacrament of\r\nPenance, and that Indulgences relate only to temporal punishments,\r\nincluding under that designation the pains of Purgatory. This modern\r\nopinion is confirmed by the most eminent authorities of the mediæval\r\nChurch. It has been accepted in the description of the theory of\r\nIndulgences given above, since it has been said that the principal use of\r\nIndulgences was to secure against Purgatory. But these statements do not\r\nexhaust the question. Mediæval theology did not create Indulgences, it\r\nonly followed and tried to justify the practices of the Pope and of the\r\nRoman Curia,—a rather difficult task. The question still remains whether\r\nsome of the Papal Bulls promulgating Indulgences did not promise the\r\nremoval of guilt as well as security against temporal punishments. If\r\nthese be examined, spurious Bulls being set aside, it will be found that\r\nmany of them make no mention of the need of previous confession and of\r\npriestly absolution; that one or two expressly make mention of a remission\r\nof guilt as well as of penalty; and that many (especially those which\r\nproclaim a Jubilee Indulgence) use language which inevitably led\r\nintelligent laymen like Dante to believe that the Popes did proclaim the\r\nremission of guilt as well as of penalty. Of course, it may be said that\r\nin those days the distinction between guilt (_culpa_) and penalty (_pœna_)\r\nhad not been very exactly defined, and that the phrase _remission of sins_\r\nwas used to denote both remission of guilt and remission of penalty; still\r\nit is difficult to withstand the conclusion that, even in theory,\r\nIndulgences had been declared to be efficacious for the removal of the\r\nguilt of sin in the presence of God.\r\n\r\nThese questions of the theological meaning of an Indulgence, though\r\nnecessary to understand the whole situation, had after all little to do\r\nwith Luther’s action. He approached the whole matter from the side of the\r\npractical effect of the proclamation of an Indulgence on the minds of\r\ncommon men who knew nothing of refined theological distinctions; and the\r\nevidence that the common people did generally believe that an Indulgence\r\ndid remove the guilt of sin is overwhelming. Contemporary chroniclers are\r\nto be found who declare that Indulgences given to Crusaders remit the\r\nguilt as well as the punishment; contemporary preachers assert that\r\nplenary Indulgences remit guilt, and justify their opinion by declaring\r\nthat such Indulgences were supposed to contain within them the Sacrament\r\nof Penance. The popular guide-books written for pilgrims to Rome and\r\nCompostella spread the popular idea that Indulgences acquired by such\r\npilgrimages do remit guilt as well as penalty. The popular belief was so\r\nthoroughly acknowledged, that even Councils had to throw the blame for it\r\non the pardon-sellers, or, like the Council of Constance, impeached the\r\nPope and compelled him to confess that he had granted Indulgences for the\r\nremission of guilt as well as of penalty. This widespread popular belief\r\nof itself justified Luther in calling attention to this side of the\r\nmatter.\r\n\r\nMoreover, it is well to see what the theory of the most respected\r\ntheologians actually meant when looked at practically. Since the\r\nformulation of the Sacrament of Penance, the theory had been that all\r\nguilt of sin and all eternal punishment were remitted in the priestly\r\nabsolution which followed the confession of the penitent. The Sacrament of\r\nPenance had abolished guilt and Hell. But there remained the actual sins\r\nto be punished, because the justice of God demanded it, and this was done\r\nin the temporal pains of Purgatory. The “common man,” if he thought at all\r\nabout it, may be excused if he considered that guilt and Hell, taken away\r\nby the one hand, were restored by the other. There remained for him the\r\nsense that God’s justice demanded _some_ punishment for the sins he had\r\ncommitted; and if this was not guilt according to theological definition,\r\nit was probably all that he could attain to. He was taught and believed\r\nthat punishment awaited him for these actual sins of his; and a punishment\r\nwhich might last thousands of years in Purgatory was not very different\r\nfrom an eternal punishment in his eyes. The Indulgence came to him filled\r\nas he was with these vague thoughts, and offered him a sure way of easing\r\nhis conscience and avoiding the punishment he knew he deserved. He had\r\nonly to pay the price of a _Papal Ticket_, perform the canonical good deed\r\nrequired, whatever it might be, and he was assured that his punishment was\r\nremitted, and God’s justice satisfied. This may not involve the thought of\r\nthe remission of guilt in the theological sense of the word, but it\r\ncertainly misled the moral instincts of the “common man” about as much as\r\nif it did. It is not surprising that the common people made the\r\ntheological mistake, if mistake it was, and saw in every plenary\r\nIndulgence the promise of the remission of guilt as well as of\r\npenalty,(161) for with them remission of guilt and quieting of conscience\r\nwere one and the same thing. It was this practical moral effect of\r\nIndulgences, and not the theological explanation of the theory, which\r\nstirred Luther to make his protest.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 2. Luther’s Theses.(162)\r\n\r\n\r\nLuther’s _Theses_ are singularly unlike what might have been expected from\r\na Professor of Theology. They lack theological definition, and contain\r\nmany repetitions which might have been easily avoided. They are simply\r\nninety-five sturdy strokes struck at a great ecclesiastical abuse which\r\nwas searing the consciences of many. They look like the utterances of a\r\nman who was in close touch with the people; who had been greatly shocked\r\nat reports brought to him of what the pardon-sellers had said; who had\r\nread a good many of the theological explanations of the practice of\r\nIndulgence, and had noted down a few things which he desired to\r\ncontradict. They read as if they were meant for laymen, and were addressed\r\nto their common sense of spiritual things. They are plain and easily\r\nunderstood, and keep within the field of simple religion and plain moral\r\ntruths.\r\n\r\nThe _Theses_ appealed irresistibly to all those who had been brought up in\r\nthe simple evangelical faith which distinguished the quiet home life of so\r\nmany German families, and who had not forsaken it. They also appealed to\r\nall who had begun to adopt that secular or non-ecclesiastical piety which,\r\nwe have seen, had been spreading quietly but rapidly throughout Germany at\r\nthe close of the Middle Ages. These two forces, both religious, gathered\r\nround Luther. The effect of the _Theses_ was almost immediate: the desire\r\nto purchase Indulgences cooled, and the sales almost stopped.\r\n\r\nThe Ninety-five _Theses_ made six different assertions about Indulgences\r\nand their efficacy:\r\n\r\ni. An Indulgence is and can only be the remission of a merely\r\necclesiastical penalty; the Church can remit what the Church has imposed;\r\nit cannot remit what God has imposed.\r\n\r\nii. An Indulgence can never remit guilt; the Pope himself cannot do such a\r\nthing; God has kept that in His own hand.\r\n\r\niii. It cannot remit the divine punishment for sin; that also is in the\r\nhands of God alone.\r\n\r\niv. It can have no efficacy for souls in Purgatory; penalties imposed by\r\nthe Church can only refer to the living; death dissolves them; what the\r\nPope can do for souls in Purgatory is by prayer, not by jurisdiction or\r\nthe power of the keys.\r\n\r\nv. The Christian who has true repentance has already received pardon from\r\nGod altogether apart from an Indulgence, and does not need one; Christ\r\ndemands this true repentance from every one.\r\n\r\nvi. The Treasury of Merits has never been properly defined, it is hard to\r\nsay what it is, and it is not properly understood by the people; it cannot\r\nbe the merits of Christ and of His saints, because these act of themselves\r\nand quite apart from the intervention of the Pope; it can mean nothing\r\nmore than that the Pope, having the power of the keys, can remit\r\necclesiastical penalties imposed by the Church; the true Treasure-house of\r\nmerits is the Holy Gospel of the grace and glory of God.\r\n\r\nThe Archbishop of Mainz, finding that the publication of the _Theses_\r\ninterfered with the sale of the Indulgences, sent a copy to Rome. Pope\r\nLeo, thinking that the whole thing was a monkish quarrel, contented\r\nhimself with asking the General of the Augustinian Eremites to keep his\r\nmonks quiet. Tetzel, in conjunction with a friend, Conrad Wimpina,\r\npublished a set of counter-theses. John Mayr of Eck, professor at\r\nIngolstadt, by far the ablest opponent Luther ever had, wrote an answer to\r\nthe _Theses_ which he entitled _Obelisks_;(163) and Luther replied in a\r\ntract with the title _Asterisks_. At Rome, Silvester Mazzolini (1460-?) of\r\nPrierio, a Dominican monk, papal censor for the Roman Province and an\r\nInquisitor, was profoundly dissatisfied with the _Ninety-five Theses_, and\r\nproceeded to criticise them severely in a _Dialogue about the Power of the\r\nPope; against the Presumptuous Conclusions of Martin Luther_. The book\r\nreached Germany by the middle of January 1518. The Augustinian Eremites\r\nheld their usual annual chapter at Heidelberg in April 1518, and Luther\r\nheard his _Theses_ temperately discussed by his brother monks. He found\r\nthe opposition to his views much stronger than he had expected; but the\r\ndiscussion was fair and honest, and Luther enjoyed it after the ominous\r\nsilence kept by most of his friends, who had thought his action rash. When\r\nhe returned from Heidelberg he began a general answer to his opponents.\r\nThe book, _Resolutiones_, was probably the most carefully written of all\r\nLuther’s writings. He thought long over it, weighed every statement\r\ncarefully, and rewrote portions several times. The preface, addressed to\r\nhis Vicar-General, Staupitz, contains some interesting autobiographical\r\nmaterial; it was addressed to the Pope; it was a detailed defence of his\r\n_Theses_.(164)\r\n\r\nThe _Ninety-five Theses_ had a circulation which was, for the time,\r\nunprecedented. They were known throughout Germany in a little over a\r\nfortnight; they were read over Western Europe within four weeks “as if\r\nthey had been circulated by angelic messengers,” says Myconius\r\nenthusiastically. Luther was staggered at the way they were received; he\r\nsaid that he had not meant to determine, but to debate. The controversy\r\nthey awakened increased their popularity. In the _Theses_, and especially\r\nin the _Resolutiones_, Luther had practically discarded all the practices\r\nwhich the Pope and the Roman Curia had introduced in the matter of\r\nIndulgences from the beginning of the thirteenth century, and all the\r\ningenious explanations Scholastic theologians had brought forward to\r\njustify these practices. The readiest way to refute him was to assert the\r\npower of the Roman Bishop; and this was the line taken by his critics.\r\nTheir arguments amount to this: the power to issue an Indulgence is simply\r\na particular instance of the power of papal jurisdiction, and Indulgences\r\nare simply what the Pope proclaims them to be. Therefore, to attack\r\nIndulgences is to attack the power of the Pope, and that cannot be\r\ntolerated. The Roman Church is virtually the Universal Church, and the\r\nPope is practically the Roman Church. Hence, as the representative of the\r\nRoman Church, which in turn represents the Church Universal, the Pope,\r\nwhen he acts officially, cannot err. Official decisions are given in\r\nactions as well as in words, custom has the force of law. Therefore,\r\nwhoever objects to such a long-established system as Indulgences is a\r\nheretic, and does not deserve to be heard.(165)\r\n\r\nBut the argument which appealed most powerfully to the Roman Curia was the\r\nfact that the sales of the _Papal Tickets_ had been declining since the\r\npublication of the _Theses_. Indulgences were the source of an enormous\r\nrevenue, and anything which checked their sale would cause financial\r\nembarrassment. Pope Leo X. in his “enjoyment of the Papacy” lived\r\nlavishly. He had a huge income, much greater than that of any European\r\nmonarch, but he lived beyond it. His income amounted to between four and\r\nfive hundred thousand ducats; but he had spent seven hundred thousand on\r\nhis war about the Duchy of Urbino; the magnificent reception of his\r\nbrother Julian and his bride in Rome (1514) had cost him fifty thousand\r\nducats; and he had spent over three hundred thousand on the marriage of\r\nhis nephew Lorenzo (1518). Voices had been heard in Rome as well as in\r\nGermany protesting against this extravagance. The Pope was in desperate\r\nneed of money. It is scarcely to be wondered that Luther was summoned to\r\nRome (summons dated July 1518, and received by Luther on August 7th) to\r\nanswer for his attack on the Indulgence system. To have obeyed would have\r\nmeant death.\r\n\r\nThe peremptory summons could be construed as an affront to the University\r\nof Wittenberg, on whose boards the _Ninety-five Theses_ had been posted.\r\nLuther wrote to his friend Spalatin (George Burkhardt of Spalt,\r\n1484-1545), who was chaplain and private secretary to the Elector\r\nFrederick, suggesting that the prince ought to defend the rights of his\r\nUniversity. Spalatin wrote at once to the Elector and also to the Emperor\r\nMaximilian, and the result was that the summons to Rome was cancelled, and\r\nit was arranged that the matter was to be left in the hands of the Papal\r\nLegate in Germany, Thomas de Vio, Cardinal Cajetan(166) (1470-1553), and\r\nLuther was ordered to present himself before that official at Augsburg.\r\nThe interview (October 1518) was not very satisfactory. The cardinal\r\ndemanded that Luther should recant his heresies without any argument. When\r\npressed to say what the heresies were, he named the statement in the 58th\r\nThesis that the merits of Christ work effectually without the intervention\r\nof the Pope, and that in the _Resolutiones_ which said that the sacraments\r\nare not efficacious apart from faith in the recipient. There was some\r\ndiscussion notwithstanding the Legate’s declaration; but in the end Luther\r\nwas ordered to recant or depart. He wrote out an appeal from the Pope\r\nill-informed to the Pope well-informed, also an appeal to a General\r\nCouncil, and returned to Wittenberg.\r\n\r\nWhen Luther had posted his _Theses_ on the doors of the Church of All\r\nSaints, he had been a solitary monk with nothing but his manhood to back\r\nhim; but nine months had made a wonderful difference in the situation. He\r\nnow knew that he was a representative man, with supporters to be numbered\r\nby the thousand. His colleagues at Wittenberg were with him; his students\r\ndemonstratively loyal (they had been burning the Wimpina-Tetzel\r\ncounter-theses); his theology was spreading among all the cloisters of his\r\nOrder in Germany, and even in the Netherlands; and the rapid circulation\r\nof his _Theses_ had shown him that he had the ear of Germany. His first\r\ntask, on his return to Wittenberg, was to prepare for the press an account\r\nof his interview with Cardinal Cajetan at Augsburg, and this was published\r\nunder the title, _Acta Augustana_.\r\n\r\nLuther was at pains to take the people of Germany into his confidence; he\r\npublished an account of every important interview he had; the people were\r\nable to follow him step by step, and he was never so far in advance that\r\nthey were unable to see his footprints. The immediate effect of the _Acta\r\nAugustana_ was an immense amount of public sympathy for Luther. The\r\npeople, even the Humanists who had cared little for the controversy, saw\r\nthat an eminently pious man, an esteemed teacher who was making his\r\nobscure University famous, who had done nothing but propose a discussion\r\non the notoriously intricate question of Indulgences, was peremptorily\r\nordered to recant and remain silent. They could only infer that the\r\nItalians treated the Germans contemptuously, and wished simply to drain\r\nthe country of money to be spent in the luxuries of the papal court. The\r\nElector Frederick shared the common opinion, and was, besides, keenly\r\nalive to anything which touched his University and its prosperity. There\r\nis no evidence to show that he had much sympathy with Luther’s views. But\r\nthe University of Wittenberg, the seat of learning he had founded, so long\r\nlanguishing with a very precarious life and now flourishing, was the apple\r\nof his eye; and he resolved to defend it, and to protect the teacher who\r\nhad won renown for it.\r\n\r\nThe political situation in Germany was too delicate, and the personal\r\npolitical influence of Frederick too great, for the Pope to act rashly in\r\nany matter in which that prince took a deep interest. The country was on\r\nthe eve of an election of a King of the Romans; Maximilian was old, and an\r\nimperial election might occur at any time; and Frederick was one of the\r\nmost important factors in either case. So the Pope resolved to act\r\ncautiously. The condemnation of Luther by the Cardinal-Legate was held\r\nover, and a special papal delegate was sent down to Germany to make\r\ninquiries. Every care was taken to select a man who would be likely to be\r\nacceptable to the Elector. Charles von Miltitz, a Saxon nobleman belonging\r\nto the Meisen district, a canon of Mainz, Trier, and Meissen, a papal\r\nchamberlain, an acquaintance of Spalatin’s, the Elector’s own agent at the\r\nCourt of Rome, was sent to Germany. He took with him the “Golden Rose” as\r\na token of the Pope’s personal admiration for the Elector. He was\r\nfurnished with numerous letters from His Holiness to the Elector, to some\r\nof the Saxon councillors, to the magistrates of Wittenberg, in all of\r\nwhich Luther figured as a child of the Devil. The phrase was probably\r\nforgotten when Leo wrote to Luther some time afterwards and called him his\r\ndear son.\r\n\r\nWhen Miltitz got among German speaking people he found that the state of\r\nmatters was undreamt of at the papal court. He was a German, and knew the\r\nGermans. He could see, what the Cardinal-Legate had never perceived, that\r\nhe had to deal not with the stubbornness of a recalcitrant monk, but with\r\nthe slow movement of a nation. When he visited his friends and relations\r\nin Augsburg and Nürnberg, he found that three out of five were on Luther’s\r\nside. He came to the wise resolution that he would see both Luther and\r\nTetzel privately before producing his credentials. Tetzel he could not\r\nsee. The unhappy man wrote to Miltitz that he dared not stir from his\r\nconvent, so greatly was he in danger from the violence of the people.\r\nMiltitz met Luther in the house of Spalatin; he at once disowned the\r\nspeeches of the pardon-sellers; he let it be seen that he did not think\r\nmuch of the Cardinal-Legate’s methods of action; he so prevailed on Luther\r\nthat the latter promised to write a submissive letter to the Pope, to\r\nadvise people to reverence the Roman See, to say that Indulgences were\r\nuseful in the remission of canonical penances. Luther did all this; and if\r\nthe Roman Curia had supported Miltitz there is no saying how far the\r\nreconciliation would have gone. But the Roman Curia did not support the\r\npapal chamberlain, and Miltitz had also to reckon with John Eck, who was\r\nburning to extinguish Luther in a public discussion.\r\n\r\nThe months between his interview at Augsburg (October 1518) and the\r\nDisputation with John Eck at Leipzig (June 1519) had been spent by Luther\r\nin hard and disquieting studies. His opponents had confronted him with the\r\nPope’s absolute supremacy in all ecclesiastical matters. This was one of\r\nLuther’s oldest inherited beliefs. The Church had been for him “the Pope’s\r\nHouse,” in which the Pope was the house-father, to whom all obedience was\r\ndue. It was hard for him to think otherwise. He had been re-examining his\r\nconvictions about justifying faith and attempting to trace clearly their\r\nconsequences, and whether they did lead to his declarations about the\r\nefficacy of Indulgences. He could come to no other conclusion. It became\r\nnecessary to investigate the evidence for the papal claim to absolute\r\nauthority. He began to study the Decretals, and found, to his amazement\r\nand indignation, that they were full of frauds; and that the papal\r\nsupremacy had been forced on Germany on the strength of a collection of\r\nDecretals many of which were plainly forgeries. It is difficult to say\r\nwhether the discovery brought more joy or more grief to Luther. Under the\r\ncombined influences of historical study, of the opinions of the early\r\nChurch Fathers, and of the Holy Scriptures, one of his oldest landmarks\r\nwas crumbling to pieces. His mind was in a whirl of doubt. He was\r\nhalf-exultant and half-terrified at the result of his studies; and his\r\ncorrespondence reveals how his mood of mind changed from week to week. It\r\nwas while he was thus “on the swither,” tremulously on the balance, that\r\nJohn Eck challenged him to dispute at Leipzig on the primacy and supremacy\r\nof the Roman Pontiff. The discussion might clear the air, might make\r\nhimself see where he stood. He accepted the challenge almost feverishly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 3. The Leipzig Disputation.(167)\r\n\r\n\r\nLeipzig was an enemies’ country, and his Wittenberg friends would not\r\nallow Luther to go there unaccompanied. The young Duke Barnim, who was\r\nRector of the University of Wittenberg, accompanied Carlstadt and Luther,\r\nto give them the protection of his presence. Melanchthon, who had been a\r\nmember of the teaching staff of Wittenberg since August 1518, Justus\r\nJonas, and Nicholas Amsdorf went along with them. Two hundred Wittenberg\r\nstudents in helmets and halberts formed a guard, and walked beside the two\r\ncountry carts which carried their professors. An eye-witness of the scenes\r\nat Leipzig has left us sketches of what he saw:\r\n\r\n\r\n    “In the inns where the Wittenberg students lodged, the landlord\r\n    kept a man standing with a halbert near the table to keep the\r\n    peace while the Leipzig and the Wittenberg students disputed with\r\n    each other. I have seen the same myself in the house of\r\n    Herbipolis, a bookseller, where I went to dine ... for there was\r\n    at table a Master Baumgarten ... who was so hot against the\r\n    Wittenbergers that the host had to restrain him with a halbert to\r\n    make him keep the peace so long as the Wittenbergers were in the\r\n    house and sat and ate at the table with him.”\r\n\r\n\r\nThe University buildings at Leipzig did not contain any hall large enough\r\nfor the audience, and Duke George lent the use of his great\r\nbanqueting-room for the occasion. The discussions were preceded by a\r\nservice in the church.\r\n\r\n\r\n    “When we got to the church ... they sang a Mass with twelve voices\r\n    which had never been heard before. After Mass we went to the\r\n    Castle, where we found a great guard of burghers in their armour\r\n    with their best weapons and their banners; they were ordered to be\r\n    there twice a day, from seven to nine in the morning and from two\r\n    to five in the afternoon, to keep the peace while the Disputation\r\n    lasted.”(168)\r\n\r\n\r\nFirst, there was a Disputation between Carlstadt and Eck, and then, on the\r\nfourth of July, Eck and Luther faced each other—both sons of peasants, met\r\nto protect the old or cleave a way for the new.\r\n\r\nIt was the first time that Luther had ever met a controversialist of\r\nEuropean fame. John Eck came to Leipzig fresh from his triumphs at the\r\ngreat debates in Vienna and Bologna, and was and felt himself to be the\r\nhero of the occasion.\r\n\r\n\r\n    “He had a huge square body, a full strong voice coming from his\r\n    chest, fit for a tragic actor or a town crier, more harsh than\r\n    distinct; his mouth, eyes, and whole aspect gave one the idea of a\r\n    butcher or a soldier rather than of a theologian. He gave one the\r\n    idea of a man striving to overcome his opponent rather than of one\r\n    striving to win a victory for the truth. There was as much\r\n    sophistry as good reasoning in his arguments; he was continually\r\n    misquoting his opponents’ words or trying to give them a meaning\r\n    they were not intended to convey.”\r\n\r\n\r\n“Martin,” says the same eye-witness,\r\n\r\n\r\n    “is of middle height; his body is slender, emaciated by study and\r\n    by cares; one can count almost all the bones; he stands in the\r\n    prime of his age; his voice sounds clear and distinct ... however\r\n    hard his opponent pressed him he maintained his calmness and his\r\n    good nature, though in debate he sometimes used bitter words....\r\n    He carried a bunch of flowers in his hand, and when the discussion\r\n    became hot he looked at it and smelt it.”(169)\r\n\r\n\r\nEck’s intention was to force his opponent to make some declaration which\r\nwould justify him in charging Luther with being a partisan of the mediæval\r\nheretics, and especially of the Hussites. He continually led the debate\r\naway to the Waldensians, the followers of Wiclif, and the Bohemians. The\r\naudience swayed with a wave of excitement when Luther was gradually forced\r\nto admit that there might be some truth in some of the Hussite opinions:\r\n\r\n\r\n    “One thing I must tell which I myself heard in the Disputation,\r\n    and which took place in the presence of Duke George, who came\r\n    often to the Disputation and listened most attentively; once Dr.\r\n    Martin spoke these words to Dr. Eck when hard pressed about John\r\n    Huss: ‘Dear Doctor, the Hussite opinions are not all wrong.’\r\n    Thereupon said Duke George, so loudly that the whole audience\r\n    heard, ‘God help us, the pestilence!’ (Das walt, die Sucht), and\r\n    he wagged his head and placed his arms akimbo. That I myself heard\r\n    and saw, for I sat almost between his feet and those of Duke\r\n    Barnim of Pomerania, who was then the Rector of Wittenberg.”(170)\r\n\r\n\r\nSo far as the dialectic battle was concerned, Eck had been victorious. He\r\nhad done what he had meant to do. He had made Luther declare himself. All\r\nthat was now needed was a Papal Bull against Luther, and the world would\r\nbe rid of another pestilent heretic. He had done what the more politic\r\nMiltitz had wished to avoid. He had concentrated the attention of Germany\r\non Luther, and had made him the central figure round which all the\r\nsmouldering discontent could gather. As for Luther, he returned to\r\nWittenberg full of melancholy forebodings. They did not prevent him\r\npreparing and publishing for the German people an account of the\r\nDisputation, which was eagerly read. His arguments had been historical\r\nrather than theological. He tried to show that the acknowledgment of the\r\nsupremacy of the Bishop of Rome was barely four hundred years old in\r\nWestern Europe, and that it did not exist in the East. The Greek Church,\r\nhe said, was part of the Church of Christ, and it would have nothing to do\r\nwith the Pope; the great Councils of the Early Christian centuries knew\r\nnothing about papal supremacy. Athanasius, Basil, the Gregories, Cyprian\r\nhimself, had all taken Luther’s own position, and were heretics, according\r\nto Eck. Luther’s speeches at Leipzig laid the foundation of that modern\r\nhistorical criticism of institutions which has gone so far in our own\r\ndays.\r\n\r\nIn some respects the Leipzig Disputation was the most important point in\r\nthe career of Luther. It made him see for the first time what lay in his\r\nopposition to Indulgences. It made the people see it also. His attack was\r\nno criticism, as he had at first thought, of a mere excrescence on the\r\nmediæval ecclesiastical system. He had struck at its centre; at its ideas\r\nof a priestly mediation which denied the right of every believer to\r\nimmediate entrance into the very presence of God. It was after the\r\nDisputation at Leipzig that the younger German Humanists rallied round\r\nLuther to a man; that the burghers saw that religion and opposition to\r\npriestly tyranny were not opposite things; and that there was room for an\r\nhonest attempt to create a Germany for the Germans independent of Rome.\r\nLuther found himself a new man after Leipzig, with a new freedom and wider\r\nsympathies. His depression fled. Sermons, pamphlets, letters from his\r\ntireless pen flooded the land, and were read eagerly by all classes of the\r\npopulation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 4. The Three Treatises.(171)\r\n\r\n\r\nThree of these writings stand forth so pre-eminently that they deserve\r\nspecial notice: _The Liberty of a Christian Man_, _To the Christian\r\nNobility of the German Nation_, and _On the Babylonian Captivity of the\r\nChurch_. These three books are commonly called in Germany the _Three Great\r\nReformation Treatises_, and the title befits them well. They were all\r\nwritten during the year 1520, after three years spent in controversy, at a\r\ntime when Luther felt that he had completely broken from Rome, and when he\r\nknew that he had nothing to expect from Rome but a sentence of\r\nexcommunication. His teaching may have varied in details afterwards, but\r\nin all essential positions it remained what is to be found in these books.\r\n\r\nThe tract on _The Liberty of a Christian Man_, “a very small book so far\r\nas the paper is concerned,” said Luther, “but one containing the whole sum\r\nof the Christian life,” had a somewhat pathetic history. Miltitz, hoping\r\nagainst hope that the Pope would not push things to extremities, had asked\r\nLuther to write out a short summary of his inmost beliefs and send it to\r\nHis Holiness. Luther consented, and this little volume was the result. It\r\nhas for preface Luther’s letter to Pope Leo X., which concludes thus: “I,\r\nin my poverty, have no other present to make you, nor do you need to be\r\nenriched by anything but a spiritual gift.” It was probably the last of\r\nthe three published (Oct. 1520), but it contains the principles which\r\nunderlie the other two.\r\n\r\nThe booklet is a brief statement, free from all theological subtleties, of\r\nthe priesthood of all believers which is a consequence of the fact of\r\njustification by faith alone. Its note of warning to Rome, and its\r\neducational value for pious people in the sixteenth century, consisted in\r\nits showing that the man who fears God and trusts in Him need not fear the\r\npriests nor the Church. The first part proves that every spiritual\r\npossession which a man has or can have must be traced back to his faith;\r\nif he has faith, he has all; if he has not faith, he has nothing. It is\r\nthe possession of faith which gives liberty to a Christian man; God is\r\nwith him, who can be against him?\r\n\r\n\r\n    “Here you will ask, ‘If all who are in the Church are priests, by\r\n    what character are those whom we now call priests to be\r\n    distinguished from the laity?’ I reply, By the use of those words\r\n    _priests_, _clergy_, _spiritual person_, _ecclesiastic_, an\r\n    injustice has been done, since they have been transferred from the\r\n    remaining body of Christians to those few who are now, by a\r\n    hurtful custom, called ecclesiastics. For the Holy Scripture makes\r\n    no distinction between them, except that those who are now\r\n    boastfully called Popes, Bishops, and Lords, it calls ministers,\r\n    servants, and stewards, who are to serve the rest in the ministry\r\n    of the Word, for teaching the faith of Christ and the liberty of\r\n    believers. For though it is true that we are all equally priests,\r\n    yet cannot we, nor ought we if we could, all to minister and teach\r\n    publicly.”\r\n\r\n\r\nThe second part shows that everything that a Christian man does must come\r\nfrom his faith. It may be necessary to use all the ceremonies of divine\r\nservice which past generations have found useful to promote the religious\r\nlife; perhaps to fast and practise mortifications of the flesh; but if\r\nsuch things are to be really profitable, they must be kept in their proper\r\nplace. They are good deeds not in the sense of making a man good, but as\r\nthe signs of his faith; they are to be practised with joy because they are\r\ndone for the sake of the God who has united Himself with man through Jesus\r\nChrist.\r\n\r\nNothing that Luther has written more clearly manifests that combination of\r\nrevolutionary daring and wise conservatism which was characteristic of the\r\nman. There is no attempt to sweep away any ecclesiastical machinery,\r\nprovided only it be kept in its proper place as a means to an end. But\r\nreligious ceremonies are not an end in themselves; and if through human\r\ncorruption and neglect of the plain precepts of God’s word they hinder\r\ninstead of help the true growth of the soul, they ought to be swept away;\r\nand the fact that the soul of man needs absolutely nothing in the last\r\nresort but the word of God dwelling in him, gives men courage and calmness\r\nin demanding their reformation.\r\n\r\nLuther applied those principles to the reformation of the Church in his\r\nbook on the _Babylonian Captivity of the Church_ (Sept.-Oct. 1520). He\r\nsubjected the elaborate sacramental system of the Church to a searching\r\ncriticism, and concluded that there are only two, or perhaps three,\r\nscriptural sacraments—the Eucharist, Baptism, and Penance. He denounced\r\nthe doctrine of Transubstantiation as a “monstrous phantom” which the\r\nChurch of the first twelve centuries knew nothing about, and said that any\r\nendeavour to define the precise manner of Christ’s Presence in the\r\nsacrament is simply indecent curiosity. Perhaps the most important\r\npractical portion of the book deals with the topic of Christian marriage.\r\nIn no sphere of human life has the Roman Church done more harm by\r\ninterfering with simple scriptural directions:\r\n\r\n\r\n    “What shall we say of those impious human laws by which this\r\n    divinely appointed manner of life has been entangled and tossed up\r\n    and down? Good God! it is horrible to look upon the temerity of\r\n    the tyrants of Rome, who thus, according to their caprices, at one\r\n    time annul marriages and at another time enforce them. Is the\r\n    human race given over to their caprice for nothing but to be\r\n    mocked and abused in every way, that these men may do what they\r\n    please with it for the sake of their own fatal gains? ... And what\r\n    do they sell? The shame of men and women, a merchandise worthy of\r\n    these traffickers, who surpass all that is most sordid and most\r\n    disgusting in their avarice and impiety.”\r\n\r\n\r\nLuther points out that there is a clear scriptural law on the degrees\r\nwithin which marriage is unlawful, and says that no human regulations\r\nought to forbid marriages outside these degrees or permit them within. He\r\nalso comes to the conclusion that divorce _a mensa et thoro_ is clearly\r\npermitted in Scripture; though he says that personally he hates divorce,\r\nand “prefers bigamy to it.”\r\n\r\nThe appeal _To the Christian Nobility of the German Nation_ made the\r\ngreatest immediate impression. It was written in haste, but must have been\r\nlong thought over. Luther began the introduction on June 23rd (1520); the\r\nbook was ready by the middle of August; and by the 18th, four thousand\r\ncopies were in circulation throughout Germany, and the presses could not\r\nprint fast enough for the demand. It was a call to all Germany to unite\r\nagainst Rome.\r\n\r\nIt was nobly comprehensive: it grasped the whole situation, and summed up\r\nwith vigour and clearness all the German grievances which had hitherto\r\nbeen stated separately and weakly; it brought forward every partial\r\nproposal of reform, however incomplete, and quickened it by setting it in\r\nits proper place in one combined scheme. All the parts were welded\r\ntogether by a simple and courageous faith, and made living by the moral\r\nearnestness which pervaded the whole.\r\n\r\nLuther struck directly at the imaginary mysterious semi-supernatural power\r\nsupposed to belong to the Church and the priesthood which had held Europe\r\nin awed submission for so many centuries. Reform had been impossible, the\r\nappeal said, because the walls behind which Rome lay entrenched had been\r\nleft standing—walls of straw and paper, but in appearance formidable.\r\nThese sham fortifications are: the _Spiritual Power_ which is believed to\r\nbe superior to the temporal power of kings and princes, the conception\r\nthat _no one can interpret Scripture but the Pope_, the idea that _no one\r\ncan summon a General Council but the Bishop of Rome_. These are the\r\nthreefold lines of fortification behind which the Roman Curia has\r\nentrenched itself, and the German people has long believed that they are\r\nimpregnable. Luther sets to work to demolish them.\r\n\r\nThe Romanists assert that the Pope, bishops, priests, and monks belong to\r\nand constitute the _spiritual estate_, while princes, lords, artisans, and\r\npeasants are the _temporal estate_, which is subject to the spiritual. But\r\nthis _spiritual estate_ is a mere delusion. The real _spiritual estate_ is\r\nthe whole body of believers in Jesus Christ, and they are spiritual\r\nbecause Jesus has made all His followers priests to God and to His Christ.\r\nA cobbler belongs to the _spiritual estate_ as truly as a bishop. The\r\nclergy are distinguished from the laity not by an indelible character\r\nimposed upon them in a divine mystery called ordination, but because they\r\nhave been set apart to do a particular kind of work in the commonwealth.\r\nIf a Pope, bishop, priest, or monk neglects to do the work he is there to\r\ndo, he deserves to be punished as much as a careless mason or tailor, and\r\nis as accountable to the civil authorities. The _spiritual priesthood of\r\nall believers_, the gift of the faith which justifies, has shattered the\r\nfirst and most formidable of these papal fortifications.\r\n\r\nIt is foolish to say that the _Pope alone can interpret Scripture_. If\r\nthat were true, where is the need of Holy Scriptures at all?\r\n\r\n\r\n    “Let us burn them, and content ourselves with the unlearned\r\n    gentlemen at Rome, in whom the Holy Ghost alone dwells, who,\r\n    however, can dwell in pious souls only. If I had not read it, I\r\n    could never have believed that the devil should have put forth\r\n    such follies at Rome and find a following.”\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Holy Scripture is open to all, and can be interpreted by all true\r\nbelievers who have the mind of Christ and approach the word of God humbly\r\nseeking enlightenment.\r\n\r\nThe third wall falls with the other two. It is nonsense to say that _the\r\nPope alone can call a Council_. We are plainly taught in Scripture that if\r\nour brother offends we are to tell it to the Church; and if the Pope\r\noffends, and he often does, we can only obey Scripture by calling a\r\nCouncil. Every individual Christian has a right to do his best to have it\r\nsummoned; the temporal powers are there to enforce his wishes; Emperors\r\ncalled General Councils in the earlier ages of the Church.\r\n\r\nThe straw and paper walls having been thus cleared away, Luther proceeds\r\nto state his indictment. There is in Rome one who calls himself the Vicar\r\nof Christ, and who lives in a state of singular resemblance to our Lord\r\nand to St. Peter, His apostle. For this man wears a triple crown (a single\r\none does not content him), and keeps up such a state that he needs a\r\nlarger personal revenue than the Emperor. He has surrounding him a number\r\nof men, called cardinals, whose only apparent use is that they serve to\r\ndraw to themselves the revenues of the richest convents, endowments, and\r\nbenefices in Europe, and spend the money thus obtained in keeping up the\r\nstate of a great monarch in Rome. When it is impossible to seize the whole\r\nrevenue of an ecclesiastical benefice, the Curia joins some ten or twenty\r\ntogether, and mulcts each in a good round sum for the benefit of the\r\ncardinal. Thus the priory of Würzburg gives one thousand gulden yearly,\r\nand Bamberg, Mainz, and Trier pay their quotas. The papal court is\r\nenormous,—three thousand papal secretaries, and hangers-on innumerable;\r\nand all are waiting for German benefices, whose duties they never fulfil,\r\nas wolves wait for a flock of sheep. Germany pays more to the Curia than\r\nit gives to its own Emperor. Then look at the way Rome robs the whole\r\nGerman land. Long ago the Emperor permitted the Pope to take the half of\r\nthe first year’s income from every benefice—the _Annates_—to provide for a\r\nwar against the Turks. The money was never spent for the purpose destined;\r\nyet it has been regularly paid for a hundred years, and the Pope demands\r\nit as a regular and legitimate tax, and uses it to pay posts and offices\r\nat Rome.\r\n\r\n\r\n    “Whenever there is any pretence of fighting the Turk, they send\r\n    out commissions for collecting money, and often proclaim\r\n    Indulgences under the same pretext.... They think that we,\r\n    Germans, will always remain such great fools, and that we will go\r\n    on giving money to satisfy their unspeakable greed, though we see\r\n    plainly that neither _Annates_ nor _Indulgence-money_ nor\r\n    anything—not one farthing—goes against the Turks, but all goes\r\n    into their bottomless sack, ... and all this is done in the name\r\n    of Christ and of St. Peter.”\r\n\r\n\r\nThe chicanery used to get possession of German benefices for officials of\r\nthe Curia, the exactions on the bestowal of the _pallium_, the trafficking\r\nin exemptions and permissions to evade laws ecclesiastical and moral, are\r\nall trenchantly described. The most shameless are those connected with\r\nmarriage. The Curial Court is described as a place\r\n\r\n\r\n    “where vows are annulled; where a monk gets leave to quit his\r\n    cloister; where priests can enter the married life for money;\r\n    where bastards can become legitimate, and dishonour and shame may\r\n    arrive at high honours, and all evil repute and disgrace is\r\n    knighted and ennobled; where a marriage is suffered that is in a\r\n    forbidden degree, or has some other defect.... There is a buying\r\n    and selling, a changing, blustering, and bargaining, cheating and\r\n    lying, robbing and stealing, debauchery and villainy, and all\r\n    kinds of contempt of God, that Antichrist himself could not reign\r\n    worse.”\r\n\r\n\r\nThe plan of reform sketched includes—the complete abolition of the power\r\nof the Pope over the State; the creation of a national German Church, with\r\nan ecclesiastical Council of its own to be the final court of appeal for\r\nGermany, and to represent the German Church as the Diet did the German\r\nState; some internal religious reforms, such as the limitation of the\r\nnumber of pilgrimages, which were destroying morality and creating a\r\ndistaste for honest work; reductions in the mendicant orders and in the\r\nnumber of vagrants who thronged the roads, and were a scandal in the\r\ntowns.\r\n\r\n\r\n    “It is of much more importance to consider what is necessary for\r\n    the salvation of the common people than what St. Francis, or St.\r\n    Dominic, or St. Augustine, or any other man laid down, especially\r\n    as things have not turned out as they expected.”\r\n\r\n\r\nHe proposes the inspection of all convents and nunneries, and permission\r\ngiven to those who are dissatisfied with their monastic lives to return to\r\nthe world; the limitation of ecclesiastical holy days, which are too often\r\nnothing but scenes of drunkenness, gluttony, and debauchery; a married\r\npriesthood, and an end put to the degrading concubinage of the German\r\npriests.\r\n\r\n\r\n    “We see how the priesthood is fallen, and how many a poor priest\r\n    is encumbered with a woman and children, and burdened in his\r\n    conscience, and no one does anything to help him, though he might\r\n    very well be helped.... I will not conceal my honest counsel, nor\r\n    withhold comfort from that unhappy crowd who now live in trouble\r\n    with wife and children, and remain in shame with a heavy\r\n    conscience, hearing their wife called a priest’s harlot, and their\r\n    children bastards.... I say that these two (who are minded in\r\n    their hearts to live together in conjugal fidelity) are surely\r\n    married before God.”\r\n\r\n\r\nThe appeal concludes with some solemn words addressed to the luxury and\r\nlicensed immorality of the German towns.\r\n\r\nNone of Luther’s writings produced such an instantaneous effect as this.\r\nIt was not the first programme urging common action in the interests of a\r\nunited Germany, but it was the most complete, and was recognised to be so\r\nby all who were working for a Germany for the Germans.\r\n\r\nThe three “Reformation treatises” were the statement of Luther’s case laid\r\nbefore the people of the Fatherland, and were a very effectual antidote to\r\nthe Papal Bull excommunicating him, which was ready for publication in\r\nGermany.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 5. The Papal Bull.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Bull, _Exurge Domine_, was scarcely worthy of the occasion. The Pope\r\nseems to have left its construction in the hands of Prierias, Cajetan, and\r\nEck, and the contents seem to show that Eck had the largest share in\r\nframing it. Much of it reads like an echo of Eck’s statements at Leipzig a\r\nyear before. It began pathetically: “Arise, O Lord, plead Thine own cause;\r\nremember how the foolish man reproacheth Thee daily; the foxes are wasting\r\nThy vineyard, which Thou hast given to Thy Vicar Peter; the boar out of\r\nthe wood doth waste it, and the wild beast of the field doth devour it.”\r\nSt. Peter is invoked, and the Pope’s distress at the news of Luther’s\r\nmisdeeds is described at length. The most disturbing thing is that the\r\nerrors of the Greeks and of the Bohemians were being revived, and that in\r\nGermany, which had hitherto been so faithful to the Holy See. Then came\r\nforty-one propositions, said to be Luther’s, which are condemned as\r\n“heretical or scandalous, or false or offensive to pious ears, or seducing\r\nto simple minds, and standing in the way of the Catholic faith.”(172) All\r\nfaithful people were ordered to burn Luther’s books wherever they could\r\nfind them. Luther himself had refused to come to Rome and submit to\r\ninstruction; he had even appealed to a General Council, contrary to the\r\ndecrees of Julius II. and Pius II.; he was therefore inhibited from\r\npreaching; he and all who followed him were ordered to make public\r\nrecantation within sixty days; if they did not, they were to be treated as\r\nheretics, were to be seized and imprisoned by the magistrates, and all\r\ntowns or districts which sheltered them were to be placed under an\r\ninterdict.\r\n\r\nAmong the forty-one propositions condemned was one—that the burning of\r\nheretics was a sin against the Spirit of Christ—to which the Pope seemed\r\nto attach special significance, so often did he repeat it in letters to\r\nthe Elector Frederick and other authorities in Germany. The others may be\r\narranged in four classes—against Luther’s opinions about Indulgences; his\r\nstatements about Purgatory; his declarations that the efficacy of the\r\nsacraments depended upon the spiritual condition of those who received\r\nthem; that penance was an outward sign of sorrow, and that good works\r\n(ecclesiastical and moral) were to be regarded as the signs of faith\r\nrather than as making men actually righteous; his denial of the later\r\n_curial_ assertions of the nature of the papal monarchy over the Church.\r\nLuther’s opinions on all these points could be supported by abundant\r\ntestimony from the earlier ages of the Church, and most of his criticisms\r\nwere directed against theories which had not been introduced before the\r\nmiddle of the thirteenth century. The Bull made no attempt to argue about\r\nthe truth of the positions taken in its sentences. There was nothing done\r\nto show that Luther’s opinions were wrong. The one dominant note running\r\nall through the papal deliverance was the simple assertion of the Pope’s\r\nright to order any discussion to cease at his command.\r\n\r\nThis did not help to commend the Bull to the people of Germany, and was\r\nspecially unsuited to an age of restless mental activity. The method\r\nadopted for publishing it in Germany was still less calculated to win\r\nrespect for its decisions. The publication was entrusted to John Eck of\r\nIngolstadt, who was universally recognised as Luther’s personal enemy; and\r\nthe hitherto unheard of liberty was granted to him to insert at his\r\npleasure the names of a certain number of persons, and to summon them to\r\nappear before the Roman Curia. He showed how unfit he was for this\r\nresponsible task by inserting the names of men who had criticised or\r\nsatirised him—Adelmann, Pirkheimer, Carlstadt, and three others.(173)\r\n\r\nEck discovered that it was an easier matter to get permission from the\r\nRoman Curia to frame a Bull against the man who had stopped the sale of\r\nIndulgences, and was drying up a great source of revenue, than to publish\r\nthe Bull in Germany. It was thought at Rome that no man had more influence\r\namong the bishops and Universities, but the Curia soon learnt that it had\r\nmade a mistake. The Universities stood upon their privileges, and would\r\nhave nothing to do with John Eck. The bishops made all manner of technical\r\nobjections. Many persons affected to believe that the Bull was not\r\nauthentic; and Luther himself did not disdain to take this line in his\r\ntract, _Against the Execrable Bull of Antichrist_. Eck, who had come down\r\nto Germany inflated with vanity, found himself mocked and scorned.\r\nPirkheimer dubbed him _gehobelter Eck_, Eck with the swelled head, and the\r\nepithet stuck. Nor was the publication any easier when the pretence of\r\nunauthenticity could be maintained no longer. The University of Wittenberg\r\nrefused to publish the Bull, on the ground that the Pope would not have\r\npermitted its issue had he known the true state of matters, and they\r\nblamed Eck for misinforming His Holiness: the Council of Electoral Saxony\r\nagreed with the Senate; and their action was generally commended. Spalatin\r\nsaid that he had seen at least thirty letters from great princes and\r\nlearned men of all districts in Germany, from Pomerania to Switzerland,\r\nand from the Breisgau to Bohemia, encouraging Luther to stand firm. Eck\r\nimplored the bishops of the dioceses surrounding Wittenberg—Merseburg,\r\nMeissen, and Brandenburg—to publish the Bull. They were either unwilling\r\nor powerless.\r\n\r\nLuther had been expecting a Bull against him ever since the Leipzig\r\nDisputation. His correspondence reveals that he met it undismayed. What\r\nharm could a papal Bull do to a man whose faith had given him fellowship\r\nwith God? What truth could there be in a Bull which clearly contradicted\r\nthe Holy Scriptures? St. Paul has warned us against believing an angel\r\nfrom heaven if he uttered words different from the Scriptures, which are\r\nour strength and our consolation; why should we pin our faith to a Pope or\r\na Council? The Bull had done one thing for him, it had made him an\r\nexcommunicated man, and therefore had freed him from his monastic vows. He\r\ncould leave the convent when he liked, only he did not choose to do so.\r\nWhen he heard that his writings had been burnt as heretical by order of\r\nthe Papal Legates, he resolved to retaliate. It was no sudden decision.\r\nEleven months previously he had assured Spalatin (January 1520) that if\r\nRome condemned and burnt his writings he would condemn and burn the papal\r\nDecretal Laws. On December 10th (1520) he posted a notice inviting the\r\nWittenberg students to witness the burning of the papal Constitutions and\r\nthe books of Scholastic Theology at nine o’clock in the morning.(174) A\r\nmultitude of students, burghers, and professors met in the open space\r\noutside the Elster Gate between the walls and the river Elbe. A great\r\nbonfire had been built. An oak tree planted long ago still marks the spot.\r\nOne of the professors kindled the pile; Luther laid the books of the\r\nDecretals on the glowing mass, and they caught the flames; then amid\r\nsolemn silence he placed a copy of the Bull on the fire, saying in Latin:\r\n_As thou hast wasted with anxiety the Holy One of God, so may the eternal\r\nflames waste thee_ (_Quia tu conturbasti Sanctum Domini, ideoque te\r\nconturbet ignis eternus_). He waited till the paper was consumed, and then\r\nwith his friends and fellow-professors he went back to the town. Some\r\nhundreds of students remained standing round the fire. For a while they\r\nwere sobered by the solemnity of the occasion and sang the _Te Deum_. Then\r\na spirit of mischief seized them, and they began singing funeral dirges in\r\nhonour of the burnt Decretals. They got a peasant’s cart, fixed in it a\r\npole on which they hung a six-foot-long banner emblazoned with the Bull,\r\npiled the small cart with the books of Eck, Emser, and other Romish\r\ncontroversialists, hauled it along the streets and out through the Elster\r\nGate, and, throwing books and Bull on the glowing embers of the bonfire,\r\nthey burnt them. Sobered again, they sang the _Te Deum_ and finally\r\ndispersed.\r\n\r\nIt is scarcely possible for us in the twentieth century to imagine the\r\nthrill that went through Germany, and indeed through all Europe, when the\r\nnews sped that a poor monk had burnt the Pope’s Bull. Papal Bulls had been\r\nburnt before Luther’s days, but the burners had been for the most part\r\npowerful monarchs. This tune it was done by a monk, with nothing but his\r\ncourageous faith to back him. It meant that the individual soul had\r\ndiscovered its true value. If eras can be dated, modern history began on\r\nDecember 10th, 1520.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 6. Luther the Representative of Germany.\r\n\r\n\r\nHitherto we have followed Luther’s personal career exclusively. It may be\r\nwell to turn aside for a little to see how the sympathy of many classes of\r\nthe people was gathering round him.\r\n\r\nThe representatives of foreign States who were present at the Diet of\r\nWorms, of England, Spain, and Venice, all wrote home to their respective\r\ngovernments about the extraordinary popularity which Luther enjoyed among\r\nalmost every class of his fellow-countrymen; and, as we shall see, the\r\ndespatches of Aleander, the papal nuncio at the Diet, are full of\r\nstatements and complaints which confirm these reports. This popularity had\r\nbeen growing since 1517, and there are traces that many thoughtful men had\r\nbeen attracted to Luther some years earlier. The accounts of Luther’s\r\ninterview with Cardinal Cajetan at Augsburg, and his attitude at the\r\nLeipzig Disputation, had given a great impulse to the veneration with\r\nwhich people regarded him; but the veneration itself had been quietly\r\ngrowing, apart from any striking incidents in his career. The evidence for\r\nwhat follows has been collected chiefly from such private correspondence\r\nas has descended to us; and most stress has been laid on letters which\r\nwere not addressed to Luther, and which were never meant to be seen by\r\nhim. Men wrote to each other about him, and described the impression he\r\nwas making on themselves and on the immediate circle of their\r\nacquaintances. We learn from such letters not merely the fact of the\r\nesteem, but what were the characteristics in the man which called it\r\nforth.(175)\r\n\r\nA large part of the evidence comes from the correspondence of educated\r\nmen, who, if they were not all Humanists strictly so called, belonged to\r\nthat increasing class on whom the New Learning had made a great\r\nimpression, and had produced the characteristic habit of mind which\r\nbelonged to its possessors. The attitude and work of Erasmus had prepared\r\nthem to appreciate Luther. The monkish opponents of the great Humanist had\r\nbeen thoroughly in the right when they feared the effects of his\r\nrevolutionary ways of thinking, however they might be accompanied with\r\nappeals against all revolutionary action. He had exhibited his idea of\r\nwhat a life of personal religion ought to be in his _Enchiridion_; he had\r\nexposed the mingled Judaism and paganism of a great part of the popular\r\nreligion; he had poured scorn on the trifling subtleties of scholastic\r\ntheology, and had asked men to return to a simple “Christian Philosophy”;\r\nabove all, he had insisted that Christianity could only renew its youth by\r\ngoing back to the study of the Holy Scriptures, and especially of the New\r\nTestament; and he had aided his contemporaries to make this return by his\r\nedition of the New Testament, and by his efforts to bring within their\r\nreach the writings of the earlier Church Fathers. His Humanist followers\r\nin Germany believed that they saw in Luther a man who was doing what their\r\nleader urged all men to do. They saw in Luther an Erasmus, who was going\r\nto the root of things. He was rejecting with increasing determination the\r\nbewildering sophistries of Scholasticism, and, what was more, he was\r\nshowing how many of these had arisen by exalting the authority of the\r\npagan Aristotle over that of St. Paul and St. Augustine. He had painfully\r\nstudied these Schoolmen, and could speak with an authority on this matter;\r\nfor he was a learned theologian. The reports of his lectures, which were\r\nspreading throughout Germany, informed them that he based his teaching on\r\na simple exposition of the Holy Scriptures in the Vulgate version, which\r\nwas sanctioned by the mediæval Church. He had revolted, and was\r\nincreasingly in revolt, against those abuses in the ordinary religious\r\nlife which were encouraged from sordid motives by the Roman Curia,—abuses\r\nwhich Erasmus had pierced through and through with the light darts of his\r\nsarcasm; and Luther knew, as Erasmus did not, what he was speaking about,\r\nfor he had surrendered himself to that popular religion, and had sought in\r\nit desperately for a means of reconciliation with God without succeeding\r\nin his quest. They saw him insisting, with a strenuousness no Humanist had\r\nexhibited, on the Humanist demand that every man had a right to stand true\r\nto his own personal conscientious convictions. If some of them, like\r\nErasmus, in spite of their scorn of monkery, still believed that the\r\nhighest type of the religious life was a sincere self-sacrificing\r\nFranciscan monk, they saw their ideal in the Augustinian Eremite, whose\r\nlife had never been stained by any monkish scandal, and who had been\r\nproclaimed by his brother monks to be a model of personal holiness. They\r\nwere sure that when he pled heroically for the freedom of the religious\r\nlife, his courage, which they could not emulate, rested on a depth and\r\nstrength of personal piety which they sadly confessed they themselves did\r\nnot possess. If they complained at times that Luther spoke too strongly\r\nagainst the Pope, they admitted that he was going to the root of things in\r\nhis attack. All clear-sighted men perceived that the _one_ obstacle to\r\nreform was the theory of the papal monarchy, which had been laboriously\r\nconstructed by Italian canonists after the failure of Conciliar reform,—a\r\ntheory which defied the old mediæval ecclesiastical tradition, and\r\ncontradicted the solemn decisions of the great German Councils of\r\nConstance and Basel. Luther’s attacks on the Papacy were not stronger than\r\nthose of Gerson and d’Ailly, and his language was not more unmeasured than\r\nthat of their common master, William of Occam. There was nothing in these\r\nearly days to prevent men who were genuinely attached to the mediæval\r\nChurch, its older theology and its ancient rites, from rallying round\r\nLuther. When the marches began to be redd, and the beginnings of a\r\nProtestant Church confronted the mediæval, the situation was changed. Many\r\nwho had enthusiastically supported Luther left him.\r\n\r\nConrad Mutianus, canon of Gotha, and the veteran leader of the Erfurt\r\ncircle of Humanists, wrote admiringly of the originality of Luther’s\r\nsermons as early as 1515. He applauded the stand he took at Leipzig, and\r\nspoke of him as _Martinum, Deo devotissimum doctorem_. His followers were\r\nno longer contented with a study of the classical authors. Eobanus Hessus,\r\ncrowned “poet-king” of Germany, abandoned his _Horace_ for the\r\n_Enchiridion_ of Erasmus and the Holy Scriptures. Justus Jonas (Jodocus\r\nKoch of Nordlingen) forsook classical Greek to busy himself with the\r\nEpistles to the Corinthians. The wicked satirist, Curicius Cordus, betook\r\nhimself to the New Testament. They did this out of admiration for Erasmus,\r\n“their father in Christ.” But when Luther appeared, when they read his\r\npamphlets circulating through Germany, when they followed, step by step,\r\nhis career, they came under the influence of a new spell. The _Erasmici_,\r\nto use the phrases of the times, diminished, and the _Martiniani_\r\nincreased in numbers. One of the old Erfurt circle, Johannes Crotus\r\nRubeanus, was in Rome. His letters, passed round among his friends, made\r\nno small impression upon them. He told them that he was living in the\r\ncentre of the plague-spot of Europe. He reviled the Curia as devoid of all\r\nmoral conscience. “The Pope and his carrion-crows” were sitting content,\r\ngorged on the miseries of the Church. When Crotus received from Germany\r\ncopies of Luther’s writings, he distributed them secretly to his Italian\r\nfriends, and collected their opinions to transmit to Germany. They were\r\nall sympathetically impressed with what Luther said, but they pitied him\r\nas a man travelling along a very dangerous road; no real reform was\r\npossible without the destruction of the whole curial system, and that was\r\ntoo powerful for any man to combat. Yet Luther was a hero; he was the\r\n_Pater Patriæ_ of Germany; his countrymen ought to erect a golden statue\r\nin his honour; they wished him God-speed. When Crotus returned to Germany\r\nand got more in touch with Luther’s work, he felt more drawn to the\r\nReformer, and wrote enthusiastically to his friends that Luther was the\r\npersonal revelation of Christ in modern times. So we find these Humanists\r\ndeclaring that Luther was the St. Paul of the age, the modern Hercules,\r\nthe Achilles of the sixteenth century.\r\n\r\nNo Humanist circle gave Luther more enthusiastic support than that of\r\nNürnberg. The soil had been prepared by a few ardent admirers of Staupitz,\r\nat the head of whom was Wenceslas Link, prior of the Augustinian-Eremites\r\nin Nürnberg, and a celebrated preacher. They had learned from Staupitz\r\nthat blending of the theology of Augustine with the later German mysticism\r\nwhich was characteristic of the man, and it prepared them to appreciate\r\nthe deeper experimental teaching of Luther. Among these Nürnberg Humanists\r\nwas Christopher Scheurl, a jurist, personally acquainted with Luther and\r\nwith Eck. The shortlived friendship between the two antagonists had been\r\nbrought about by Scheurl, whose correspondence with Luther began in 1516.\r\nScheurl was convinced that Luther’s cause was the “cause of God.” He told\r\nEck this. He wrote to him (February 18th, 1519) that all the most\r\nspiritually minded clergymen that he knew were devoted to Luther; that\r\n“they flew to him in dense troops, like starlings”; that their deepest\r\nsympathies were with him; and that they confessed that their holiest\r\ndesires were prompted by his writings. Albert Dürer expressed his\r\nadmiration by painting Luther as St. John, the beloved disciple of the\r\nLord. Caspar Nützel, one of the most dignified officials of the town,\r\nthought it an honour to translate Luther’s _Ninety-five Theses_ into\r\nGerman. Lazarus Sprengel delighted to tell his friends how Luther’s tracts\r\nand sermons were bringing back to a living Christianity numbers of his\r\nacquaintances who had been perplexed and driven from the faith by the\r\ntrivialities common in ordinary sermons. Similar enthusiasm showed itself\r\nin Augsburg and other towns. After the Leipzig Disputation, the great\r\nprinter of Basel, Frobenius, became an ardent admirer of Luther; reprinted\r\nmost of his writings, and despatched them to Switzerland, France, the\r\nNetherlands, Italy, England, and Spain. He delighted to tell of the\r\nfavourable reception they met with in these foreign countries,—how they\r\nhad been welcomed by Lefèvre in France, and how the Swiss Cardinal von\r\nSitten had said that Luther deserved all honour, for he spoke the truth,\r\nwhich no special pleading of an Eck could overthrow. The distinguished\r\njurist Ulrich Zasius of Freiburg said that Luther was an “angel\r\nincarnate,” and while he deprecated his strong language against the Pope,\r\nhe called him the “Phœnix among Christian theologians,” the “flower of the\r\nChristian world,” and the “instrument of God.” Zasius was a man whose\r\nwhole religious sympathies belonged to the mediæval conception of the\r\nChurch, yet he spoke of Luther in this way.\r\n\r\nIt is perhaps difficult for us now to comprehend the state of mind which\r\nlonged for the new and yet clung to the old, which made the two Nürnberg\r\nfamilies, the Ebners and the Nützlers, season the ceremonies at their\r\nfamily gathering to celebrate their daughters taking the veil with\r\nspeeches in praise of Luther and of his writings. Yet this was the\r\ndominant note in the vast majority of the supporters of Luther in these\r\nearlier years.\r\n\r\nMen who had no great admiration for Luther personally had no wish to see\r\nhim crushed by the Roman Curia by mere weight of authority. Even Duke\r\nGeorge of Saxony, who had called Luther a pestilent fellow at the Leipzig\r\nDisputation, had been stirred into momentary admiration by the _Address to\r\nthe Christian Nobility of the German Nation_, and had no great desire to\r\npublish the Bull within his dominions; and his private secretary and\r\nchaplain, Jerome Emser, although a personal enemy who never lost an\r\nopportunity of controverting Luther, nevertheless hoped that he might be\r\nthe instrument of effecting a reformation in the Church. Jacob Wimpheling\r\nof Strassburg, a thoroughgoing mediævalist who had manifested no sympathy\r\nfor Reuchlin, and his friend Christopher of Utenheim, Bishop of Basel,\r\nhoped that the movement begun by Luther might lead to that reformation of\r\nthe Church on mediæval lines which they both earnestly desired.\r\n\r\nPerhaps no one represented better the attitude of the large majority of\r\nLuther’s supporters, in the years between 1517 and 1521, than did the\r\nPrince, who is rightly called Luther’s protector, Frederick the Elector of\r\nSaxony. It is a great though common mistake to suppose that Frederick\r\nshared those opinions of Luther which afterwards grew to be the Lutheran\r\ntheology. His brother John, and in a still higher degree his nephew John\r\nFrederick, were devoted Lutherans in the theological sense; but there is\r\nno evidence to show that Frederick ever was.\r\n\r\nFrederick never had any intimate personal relations with Luther. At\r\nSpalatin’s request, he had paid the expenses of Luther’s _promotion_ to\r\nthe degree of Doctor of the Holy Scriptures; he had, of course, acquiesced\r\nin his appointment to succeed Spalatin as Professor of Theology; and he\r\nmust have appreciated keenly the way in which Luther’s work had gradually\r\nraised the small and declining University to the position it held in 1517.\r\nA few letters were exchanged between Luther and Frederick, but there is no\r\nevidence that they ever met in conversation; nor is there any that\r\nFrederick had ever heard Luther preach. When he lay dying he asked Luther\r\nto come and see him; but the Reformer was far distant, trying to dissuade\r\nthe peasants from rising in rebellion, and when he reached the palace his\r\nold protector had breathed his last.\r\n\r\nThe Elector was a pious man according to mediæval standards. He had\r\nreceived his earliest lasting religious impressions from intercourse with\r\nAugustinian Eremite monks when he was a boy at school at Grimma, and he\r\nmaintained the closest relations with the Order all his life. He valued\r\nhighly all the external aids to a religious life which the mediæval Church\r\nhad provided. He believed in the virtue of pilgrimages and relics. He had\r\nmade a pilgrimage to the Holy Land, and had brought back a great many\r\nrelics, which he had placed in the Church of All Saints in Wittenberg, and\r\nhe had agents at Venice and other Mediterranean ports commissioned to\r\nsecure other relics for his collection. He continued to purchase them as\r\nlate as the year 1523. He believed in Indulgences of the older\r\ntype,—Indulgences which remitted in whole or in part ecclesiastically\r\nimposed _satisfactions_,—and he had procured two for use in Saxony. One\r\nserved as an endowment for the upkeep of his bridge at Torgau, and he had\r\nonce commissioned Tetzel to preach its virtues; the other was to benefit\r\npilgrims who visited and venerated his collection of relics on All Saints’\r\nDay. But it is clear that he disliked Indulgences of the kind Luther had\r\nchallenged, and had small belief in the good faith of the Roman Curia. He\r\nhad prevented money collected for one plenary Indulgence leaving the\r\ncountry, and he had forbidden Tetzel to preach the last Indulgence within\r\nhis territories. His sympathies were all with Luther on this question. He\r\nwas an esteemed patron of the pious society called _St. Ursula’s\r\nSchifflein_. He went to Mass regularly, and his attendances became\r\nfrequent when he was in a state of hesitation or perplexity. When he was\r\nat Köln (November 1520), besieged by the papal nuncios to induce him to\r\npermit the publication of the Bull against Luther within his lands,\r\nSpalatin noted that he went to Mass three times in one day. His reverence\r\nfor the Holy Scriptures must have created a bond of sympathy between\r\nLuther and himself. He talked with his private secretary about the\r\nincomparable majesty and power of the word of God, and contrasted its\r\nsublimities with the sophistries and trivialities of the theology of the\r\nday. He maintained firmly the traditional policy of his House to make the\r\ndecisions of the Councils of Constance and of Basel effective within\r\nElectoral Saxony, in spite of protests from the Curia and the higher\r\necclesiastics, and was accustomed to consider himself responsible for the\r\necclesiastical as well as for the civil good government of his lands.\r\nAleander had considered it a master-stroke of policy to procure the\r\nburning of Luther’s books at Köln while the Elector was in the city.\r\nFrederick only regarded the deed as a petty insult to himself. He was a\r\nstaunch upholder of the rights and liberties of the German nation, and\r\nremembered that by an old concordat, which every Emperor had sworn to\r\nmaintain, every German had the right to appeal to a General Council, and\r\ncould not be condemned without a fair trial; and this Bull had made\r\nLuther’s appeal to a Council one of the reasons for his condemnation. So,\r\nin spite of the “golden rose” and other blandishments, in spite of threats\r\nthat he might be included in the excommunication of his subject and that\r\nthe privileges of his University might be taken away, he stood firm, and\r\nwould not withdraw his protection from Luther. He was a pious German\r\nprince of the old-fashioned type, with no great love for Italians, and was\r\nnot going to be browbeaten by papal nuncios. His attitude towards Luther\r\nrepresents very fairly that of the great mass of the German people on the\r\neve of the Diet of Worms.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter III. The Diet Of Worms.(176)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 1. The Roman Nuncio Aleander.\r\n\r\n\r\nRome had done its utmost to get rid of Luther by ecclesiastical measures,\r\nand had failed. If he was to be overthrown, if the new religious movement\r\nand the national uprising which enclosed it were to be stifled, this could\r\nonly be done by the aid of the supreme secular authority. The Curia turned\r\nto the Emperor.\r\n\r\nMaximilian had died suddenly on the 12th of January 1519. After some\r\nmouths of intriguing, the papal diplomacy being very tortuous, his\r\ngrandson Charles, the young King of Spain, was unanimously chosen to be\r\nhis successor (June 28th, 1519). Troubles in Spain prevented him leaving\r\nthat country at once to take possession of his new dignities. He was\r\ncrowned at Aachen on the 23rd of October 1520, and opened his first German\r\nDiet on January 22nd, 1521, at Worms.\r\n\r\nThe Pope had selected two envoys to wait on the young Emperor, the\r\nProtonotary Marino Caraccioli (1469-1530), who was charged with the\r\nordinary diplomatic business, and Jerome Aleander, the Director of the\r\nVatican Library, who was appointed to secure the outlawry of Luther.\r\n\r\nThe Roman Curia had in Aleander one of the most clear-sighted, courageous,\r\nand indefatigable of diplomatists. He was an Italian, born of a burgher\r\nfamily in the little Venetian town of Motta (1480-1542), educated at Padua\r\nand Venice; he had begun life as a Humanist, had lectured on Greek with\r\ndistinction in Paris, and had been personally acquainted with many of the\r\nGerman Humanists, who could not forgive the “traitor” who had deserted\r\ntheir ranks to serve an obscurantist party. His graphic letters, full of\r\nminute details, throb with the hopes and fears of the papal diplomacy. The\r\nreader has his fingers on the pulse of those momentous mouths. The Legate\r\nwas in a land where “every stone and every tree cried out, ‘Luther.’ ”\r\nLandlords refused him lodging. He had to shiver during these winter months\r\nin an attic without a stove. The stench and dirt of the house were worse\r\nthan the cold. When he appeared on the streets he saw scowling faces,\r\nhands suddenly carried to the hilts of swords, heard curses shrieked after\r\nhim. He was struck on the breast by a Lutheran doorkeeper when he tried to\r\nget audience of the Elector of Saxony, and no one in the crowd interfered\r\nto protect him. He saw caricatures of himself hanging head downwards from\r\na gibbet. He received the old deadly German feud-letters from Ulrich von\r\nHutten, safe in the neighbouring castle of Ebernberg, about a day’s ride\r\ndistant.(177) The imperial Councillors to whom he complained had neither\r\nthe men nor the means to protect him. When he tried to publish answers to\r\nthe attacks on the Papacy which the Lutheran presses poured forth, he\r\ncould scarcely find a printer; and when he did, syndicates bought up his\r\npamphlets and destroyed them. As the weeks passed he came to understand\r\nthat there was only one man on whom he could rely—the young Emperor,\r\nbelieved by all but himself to be a puppet in the hands of his\r\nCouncillors, whom Pope Leo had called a “good child,” but whom Aleander\r\nfrom his first interview at Antwerp had felt to be endowed with “a\r\nprudence far beyond his years,” and to “have much more at the back of his\r\nhead than he carried on his face.” He also came to believe that the one\r\nman to be feared was the old Elector of Saxony, “that basilisk,” that\r\n“German fox,” that “marmot with the eyes of a dog, who glanced obliquely\r\nat his questioners.”\r\n\r\nAleander was a pure worldling, a man of indifferent morals, showing traces\r\nof cold-blooded cruelty (as when he slew five peasants for the loss of one\r\nof his dogs, or tried to get Erasmus poisoned). He believed that every man\r\nhad his price, and that low and selfish motives were alone to be reckoned\r\nwith. But he did the work of the Curia at Worms with a thoroughness which\r\nmerited the rewards he obtained afterwards.(178) He had spies\r\neverywhere—in the households of the Emperor and of the leading princes,\r\nand among the population of Worms. He had no hesitation in lying when he\r\nthought it useful for the “faith,” as he frankly relates.(179) The Curia\r\nhad laid a difficult task upon him. He was to see that Luther was put\r\nunder the ban of the Empire at once and unheard. The Bull had condemned\r\nhim: the secular power had nothing to do but execute the sentence.\r\nAleander had little difficulty in persuading the Emperor to this course\r\nwithin his hereditary dominions. An edict was issued ordering Luther’s\r\nbooks to be burnt, and the Legate had the satisfaction of presiding at\r\nseveral literary _auto-da-fés_ in Antwerp and elsewhere. He was also\r\nsuccessful with some of the ecclesiastical princes of Germany.(180) But it\r\nwas impossible to get this done at Worms. Failing this, it was Aleander’s\r\nbusiness to see that Luther’s case was kept separate from the question of\r\nGerman national grievances against the Papacy, and that, if it proved to\r\nbe impossible to prevent Luther appearing before the Diet, he was to be\r\nsummoned there simply for the purpose of making public recantation. With\r\nthe assistance of the Emperor he was largely successful.(181)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 2. The Emperor Charles V.\r\n\r\n\r\nAleander was not the real antagonist of Luther at Worms; he was not worthy\r\nof the name. The German Diet was the scene of a fight of faiths; and the\r\nman of faith on the mediæval side was the young Emperor. He represented\r\nthe believing past as Luther represented the believing future.(182) “What\r\nmy forefathers established at Constance and other Councils,” he said, “it\r\nis my privilege to uphold. A single monk, led astray by private judgment,\r\nhas set himself against the faith held by all Christians for a thousand\r\nyears and more, and impudently concludes that all Christians up till now\r\nhave erred. I have therefore resolved to stake upon this cause all my\r\ndominions, my friends, my body and my blood, my life and soul.”(183) The\r\ncrisis had not come suddenly on him. As early as May 12th, 1520, Juan\r\nManuel, his ambassador at Rome, had written to him asking him to pay some\r\nattention to “a certain Martin Luther, who belongs to the following of the\r\nElector of Saxony,” and whose preaching was causing some discontent at the\r\nRoman Curia. Manuel thought that Luther might prove useful in a diplomatic\r\ndispute with the Curia.(184) Charles had had time to think over the matter\r\nin his serious, reserved way; and this was the decision he had come to.\r\nThe declaration was all the more memorable when it is remembered that\r\nCharles owed his election to that rising feeling of nationality which\r\nsupported Luther,(185) and that he had to make sure of German assistance\r\nin his coming struggle with Francis I. A certain grim reality lurked in\r\nthe words, that he was ready to stake his dominions on the cause he\r\nadopted. There is much to be said for the opinion that “the Lutheran\r\nquestion made a man of the boy-ruler.”(186)\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, it is well to remember that the young Emperor did not\r\ntake the side of the Pope nor commit himself to the Curial ideas of the\r\nabsolute character of papal supremacy. He laid stress on the unity of the\r\nCatholic (mediæval) Church, on the continuity of its rites, and on the\r\nneed of maintaining its authority; but the seat of that authority was for\r\nhim a General Council. The declaration in no way conflicts with the\r\nchanges in imperial policy which may be traced during the opening weeks of\r\nthe Diet, nor with that future action which led to the Sack of Rome and to\r\nthe Augsburg Interim (1548). It is possible that the young ruler had read\r\nand admired Luther’s earlier writings, and that he had counted on him as\r\nan aid in bringing the Church to a better condition. It is more than\r\nprobable that he already believed that it was his duty to free the Church\r\nfrom the abuses which abounded;(187) but Luther’s fierce attack on the\r\nPope disgusted him, and a reformation which came from the people\r\nthreatened secular as well as ecclesiastical authority. He had made up his\r\nmind that Luther must be condemned, and told the German princes that he\r\nwould not change one iota of his determination. But this did not prevent\r\nhim making use of Luther to further his diplomatic dealings with the Pope\r\nand wring concessions from the Curia. For one thing, the Pope had been\r\ninterfering with the Inquisition in Spain, trying to mitigate its\r\nseverity; and Charles, like his maternal grandfather, Ferdinand of Aragon,\r\nbelieved that the Holy Office was a help in curbing the freedom-loving\r\npeople of Spain, and had no wish to see his instrument of punishment made\r\nless effectual. For another, it was evident that Francis I. was about to\r\ninvade Italy, and Charles wished the Pope to take his side. If the Pope\r\ngave way to him on both of these points, he was ready to carry out his\r\nwishes about Luther as far as that was possible.(188)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 3. In the City of Worms.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe city of Worms was crowded with men of diverse opinions and of many\r\ndifferent nationalities. The first Diet of the youthful Emperor (Charles\r\nwas barely one and twenty), from whom men of all parties expected so much,\r\nhad attracted much larger numbers than usually attended these assemblies.\r\nWeighty matters affecting all Germany were down on the _agenda_. There was\r\nthe old constitutional question of monarchy or oligarchy bequeathed from\r\nthe Diets of Maximilian; curiosity to see whether the new ruler would\r\nplace before the Estates a truly imperial policy, or whether, like his\r\npredecessors, he would subordinate national to dynastic considerations;\r\nthe deputies from the cities were eager to get some sure provisions made\r\nfor ending the private wars which disturbed trade; all classes were\r\nanxious to provide for an effective central government when the Emperor\r\nwas absent from Germany; local statesmen felt the need of putting an end\r\nto the constant disputes between the ecclesiastical and secular powers\r\nwithin Germany; but the hardest problem of all, and the one which every\r\nman was thinking, talking, disputing about, was: “To take notice of the\r\nbooks and descriptions made by Friar Martin Luther against the Court of\r\nRome.”(189) Other exciting questions were stirring the crowds met at Worms\r\nbesides those mentioned on the _agenda_ of the Diet. Men were talking\r\nabout the need of making an end of the papal exactions which were draining\r\nGermany of money, and the air was full of rumours of what Sickingen and\r\nthe knights might attempt, and whether there was going to be another\r\npeasant revolt. These questions were instinctively felt to hang together,\r\nand each had an importance because of the way in which it was connected\r\nwith the religious and social problems of the day. For the people of\r\nGermany and for the foreign representatives who were gathered together at\r\nWorms, it is unquestionable that the Lutheran movement, and how it was to\r\nbe dealt with, was the supreme problem of the moment. All these various\r\nthings combined to bring together at Worms a larger concourse of people\r\nthan had been collected in any German town since the meeting of the\r\nGeneral Council at Constance in 1414.\r\n\r\nWorms was one of the oldest towns in Germany. Its people were turbulent,\r\nasserting their rights as the inhabitants of a free imperial city, and in\r\nconstant feud with their bishop. They had endured many an interdict, were\r\nfiercely anti-clerical, and were to a man on Luther’s side. The crowded\r\nstreets were thronged with princes, their councillors and their retinues;\r\nwith high ecclesiastical dignitaries and their attendant clergy; with\r\nnobles and their “riders”; with landsknechts, artisans, and peasants.\r\nSpanish, French, and Italian merchants, on their way home-wards from the\r\nFrankfurt fair, could be seen discussing the last phase of the Lutheran\r\nquestion, and Spanish nobles and Spanish merchants more than once came to\r\nblows in the narrow thoroughfares. The foreign merchants, especially the\r\nSpaniards, all appeared to take the Lutheran side; not because they took\r\nmuch interest in doctrines, but because they felt bound to stand up for\r\nthe man who had dared to say that no one should be burned for his\r\nopinions. These Spanish merchants made themselves very prominent. They\r\njoined in syndicates with the more fervent German partisans of Luther to\r\nbuy up and destroy papal pamphlets; they bought Luther’s writings to carry\r\nhome. Aleander curses these _marrani_,(190) as he calls them, and relates\r\nthat they are getting Luther’s works translated into Spanish. It is\r\nprobable that many of them had Moorish blood in them, and knew the horrors\r\nof the Inquisition. Aleander’s spies told him that caricatures of himself\r\nand other prominent papalists were hawked about, and that pictures of\r\nLuther with the Dove hovering over his head, Luther with his head crowned\r\nwith a halo of rays, Luther and Hutten,(191) the one with a Bible and the\r\nother with a sword, were eagerly bought in the streets. These pictures\r\nwere actually sold in the courts and rooms of the episcopal palace where\r\nthe Emperor was lodged. On the steps of the churches, at the doors of\r\npublic buildings, colporteurs offered to eager buyers the tracts of Luther\r\nagainst the Pope, and the satires of Ulrich von Hutten in Latin and in\r\nGerman. On the streets and in open spaces like the Market, crowds of keen\r\ndisputants argued about the teaching of Luther, and praised him in the\r\nmost exaggerated ways.\r\n\r\nInside the Electoral College opinion was divided. The Archbishop of Köln,\r\nthe Elector of Brandenburg, and his brother the Archbishop of Mainz, were\r\nfor Luther’s condemnation, while the Elector of Saxony had great influence\r\nover the Archbishop of Trier and the Count Palatine of the Rhine. The\r\nlatter, says Aleander, scarcely opened his mouth during the year, but now\r\n“roared like ten bulls” on Luther’s behalf. Aleander had his first\r\nopportunity of addressing the Diet on February 13th. He spoke for three\r\nhours, and made a strong impression. He dwelt on Luther’s doctrinal\r\nerrors, which he said were those of the Waldenses, of Wiclif, and of the\r\nHussites. He said that Luther denied the Presence of Christ in the Holy\r\nSupper, and that he was a second Arius.(192) During the days that followed\r\nthe members of the Diet came to a common understanding. They presented a\r\nmemorial in German (February 19th) to the Emperor, in which they reminded\r\nhim that no imperial edict could be published against Luther without their\r\nconsent, and that to do so before Luther had a hearing would lead to\r\nbloodshed; they proposed that Luther should be invited to come to Worms\r\nunder a safe conduct, and in the presence of the Diet be asked whether he\r\nwas the author of the books that were attributed to him, and whether he\r\ncould clear himself of the accusation of denying fundamental articles of\r\nthe faith; that he should also be heard upon the papal claims, and the\r\nDiet would judge upon them; and, finally, they prayed the Emperor to\r\ndeliver Germany from the papal tyranny.(193) The Emperor agreed that\r\nLuther should be summoned under a safe conduct and interrogated about his\r\nbooks, and whether he had denied any fundamental doctrines. But he utterly\r\nrefused to permit any discussion on the authority of the Pope, and\r\ndeclared that he would himself communicate with His Holiness about the\r\ncomplaints of Germany.(194)\r\n\r\nThe documents in the _Reichstagsakten_ reveal not only that there was a\r\ndecided difference of opinion between the Emperor and the majority of the\r\nEstates about the way in which Luther ought to be treated, but that the\r\npolicy of the Emperor and his advisers had changed between November 1520\r\nand February 1521. Aleander had found no difficulty in persuading Charles\r\nand his Flemish councillors that, so far as the Emperor’s hereditary\r\ndominions were concerned, the only thing that the civil power had to do\r\nwas to issue an edict homologating the Papal Bull banning Luther and his\r\nadherents, and ordering his books to be burnt. This had been done in the\r\nNetherlands. They had made difficulties, however, about such summary\r\naction within the German Empire. Aleander was told that the Emperor could\r\ndo nothing until after the coronation at Aachen (October 1520);(195) and\r\nin November, much to the nuncio’s disgust, the Emperor had written to the\r\nElector of Saxony (November 28th, 1520) from Oppenheim asking him to bring\r\nLuther with him to the Diet.(196) At that time Luther had no great wish to\r\ngo to the Diet, unless it was clearly understood that he was summoned not\r\nfor the purpose of merely making a recantation, but in order that he might\r\ndefend his views with full liberty of speech. He was not going to recant,\r\nand he could say so as easily and clearly at Wittenberg as at Worms. The\r\nsituation had changed at Worms. The Emperor had come over to the nuncio’s\r\nside completely. He now saw no need for Luther’s appearance. The Diet had\r\nnothing to do but to place Luther under the ban of the Empire, because he\r\nhad been declared to be a heretic by the Roman Pontiff. Aleander claimed\r\nall the credit for this change; but it is more than probable that the\r\nexplanation lies in the shifting imperial and papal policy. In the end of\r\n1520 the policy of the Roman Curia was strongly anti-imperialist. The\r\nEmperor’s ambassador at Rome, Don Manuel, had been warning his master of\r\nthe papal intrigues against him, and suggesting that Charles might show\r\nsome favour to a “certain Martin Luther”; and this advice might easily\r\nhave inspired the letter of the 28th of November. At all events the papal\r\npolicy had been changing, and showing signs of becoming less hostile to\r\nthe Emperor. However the matter be accounted for, Aleander found that\r\nafter the Emperor’s presence within Worms it was much more easy for him to\r\npress the papal view about Luther upon Charles and his advisers.(197)\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the Germans in the Diet held stoutly to the opinion\r\nthat no countryman of theirs should be placed under the ban of the Empire\r\nwithout being heard in his defence, and that they and not the Bishop of\r\nRome were to be the judges in the matter.\r\n\r\nThe two months before Luther’s appearance saw open opposition between the\r\nEmperor and the Diet, and abundant secret intrigue—an edict proposed\r\nagainst Luther,(198) which the Diet refused to accept;(199) an edict\r\nproposed to order the burning of Luther’s books, which the Diet also\r\nobjected to;(200) this edict revised and limited to the seizure of\r\nLuther’s writings, which was also found fault with by the Diet; and,\r\nfinally, the Emperor issuing this revised edict on his own authority and\r\nwithout the consent of the Diet.(201)\r\n\r\nThe command to appear before the Diet on April 16th, 1521, and the\r\nimperial safe conduct were entrusted to the imperial herald, Caspar Strum,\r\nwho delivered them at Wittenberg on the 26th of March.(202) Luther calmly\r\nfinished some literary work, and left for the Diet on April 2nd. He\r\nbelieved that he was going to his death. “My dear brother,” he said to\r\nMelanchthon at parting, “if I do not come back, if my enemies put me to\r\ndeath, you will go on teaching and standing fast in the truth; if you\r\nlive, my death will matter little.” The journey seemed to the indignant\r\nPapists like a royal progress; crowds came to bless the man who had stood\r\nup for Germany against the Pope, and who was going to his death for his\r\ncourage; they pressed into the inns where he rested, and often found him\r\nsolacing himself with music. His lute was always comforting to him in\r\ntimes of excitement. Justus Jonas, the famous German Humanist, who had\r\nturned theologian much to Erasmus’ disgust, joined him at Erfurt. The\r\nnearer he came to Worms, the sharper became the disputes there. Friends\r\nand foes feared that his presence would prove oil thrown on the flames.\r\nThe Emperor began to wish he had not sent the summons. Messengers were\r\ndespatched secretly to Sickingen, and a pension promised to Hutten to see\r\nwhether they could not prevent Luther’s appearance.(203) Might he not take\r\nrefuge in the Ebernberg, scarcely a day’s journey from Worms? Was it not\r\npossible to arrange matters in a private conference with Glapion, the\r\nEmperor’s confessor? Bucer was sent to persuade him. The herald\r\nsignificantly called his attention to the imperial edict ordering\r\nmagistrates to seize his writings. But nothing daunted Luther. He would\r\nnot go to the Ebernberg; he could see Glapion at Worms, if the confessor\r\nwished an interview; what he had to say would be said publicly at Worms.\r\n\r\nLuther had reached Oppenheim, a town on the Rhine about fifteen miles\r\nnorth from Worms, and about twenty east from the Ebernberg, on April 14th.\r\nThere he for the last time rejected the insidious temptations of his\r\nenemies and the distracted counsels of his friends, that he should turn\r\naside and seek shelter with Francis von Sickingen. There he penned his\r\nfamous letter to Spalatin, that he would come to Worms if there were as\r\nmany devils as tiles on the house roofs to prevent him, and at the same\r\ntime asked where he was to lodge.(204)\r\n\r\nThe question was important. The Romanists had wished that Luther should be\r\nplaced under the Emperor’s charge as a prisoner of State, or else lodged\r\nin the Convent of the Augustinian Eremites, where he could be under\r\necclesiastical surveillance. But the Saxon nobles and their Elector had\r\nresolved to trust no one with the custody of their countryman. The Elector\r\nFrederick and part of his suite had found accommodation at an inn called\r\n_The Swan_, and the rest of his following were in the House of the Knights\r\nof St. John. Both houses were full; but it was arranged that Luther was to\r\nshare the room of two Saxon gentlemen, v. Hirschfeld and v. Schott, in the\r\nlatter building.(205) Next morning, Justus Jonas, who had reached Worms\r\nbefore Luther, after consultation with Luther’s friends, left the town\r\nearly on Tuesday morning (April 16th) to meet the Reformer, and tell him\r\nthe arrangements made. With him went the two gentlemen with whom Luther\r\nwas to lodge.(206) A large number of Saxon noblemen with their attendants\r\naccompanied them. When it was known that they had set out to meet Luther,\r\na great crowd of people (nearly two thousand, says Secretary Vogler), some\r\non horseback and some on foot, followed to welcome Luther, and did meet\r\nhim about two and a half miles from the town.(207)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 4. Luther in Worms.\r\n\r\n\r\nA little before eleven o’clock the watcher on tower by the Mainz Gate blew\r\nhis horn to announce that the procession was in sight, and soon afterwards\r\nLuther entered the town. The people of Worms were at their _Morgenimbiss_\r\nor _Frühmahl_, but all rushed to the windows or out into the streets to\r\nsee the arrival.(208) Caspar Sturm, the herald, rode first, accompanied by\r\nhis attendant, the square yellow banner, emblazoned with the black\r\ntwo-headed eagle, attached to his bridle arm. Then came the cart,—a\r\ngenuine Saxon _Rollwegelin_,—Luther and three companions sitting in the\r\nstraw which half filled it. The waggon had been provided by the good town\r\nof Wittenberg, which had also hired Christian Goldschmidt and his three\r\nhorses at three gulden a day.(209) Luther’s companions were his _socius\r\nitinerarius_, Brother Petzensteiner of Nürnberg;(210) his colleague\r\nNicholas Amsdorf; and a student of Wittenberg, a young Pomeranian noble,\r\nPeter Swaven, who had been one of the Wittenberg students who had\r\naccompanied Luther with halbert and helmet to the Leipzig Disputation\r\n(July 1519). Justus Jonas rode immediately behind the waggon, and then\r\nfollowed the crowd of nobles and people who had gone out to meet the\r\nReformer.\r\n\r\nAleander in his attic room heard the shouts and the trampling in the\r\nstreets, and sent out one of his people to find out the cause, guessing\r\nthat it was occasioned by Luther’s arrival. The messenger reported that\r\nthe procession had made its way through dense crowds of people, and that\r\nthe waggon had stopped at the door of the House of the Knights of St.\r\nJohn. He also informed the nuncio that Luther had got out, saying, as he\r\nlooked round with his piercing eyes, _Deus erit pro me_, and that a priest\r\nhad stepped forward, received him in his arms, then touched or kissed his\r\nrobe thrice with as much reverence as if he were handling the relics of a\r\nsaint. “They will say next,” says Aleander in his wrath, “that the\r\nscoundrel works miracles.”(211)\r\n\r\nAfter travel-stains were removed, Luther dined with ten or twelve friends.\r\nThe early afternoon brought crowds of visitors, some of whom had come\r\ngreat distances to see him. Then came long discussions about how he was to\r\nact on the morrow before the Diet. The Saxon councillors v. Feilitzsch and\r\nv. Thun were in the same house with him: the Saxon Chancellor, v. Brück,\r\nand Luther’s friend Spalatin, were at _The Swan_, a few doors away. Jerome\r\nSchurf, the Professor of Law in Wittenberg, had been summoned to Worms by\r\nthe Elector to act as Luther’s legal adviser, and had reached the town\r\nsome days before the Reformer.\r\n\r\nHow much Luther knew of the secret intrigues that had been going on at\r\nWorms about his affairs it is impossible to say. He probably was aware\r\nthat the Estates had demanded that he should have a hearing, and should be\r\nconfronted by impartial theologians, and that the complaints of the German\r\nnation against Rome should be taken up at the same time; also that the\r\nEmperor had refused to allow any theological discussion, or that the\r\ngrievances against Rome should be part of the proceedings. All that was\r\npublic property. The imperial summons and safe conduct had not treated him\r\nas a condemned heretic.(212) He had been addressed in it as _Ehrsamer_,\r\n_lieber_, _andächtiger_—terms which would not have been used to a heretic,\r\nand which were ostentatiously omitted from the safe conduct sent him by\r\nDuke George of Saxony.(213) He knew also that the Emperor had nevertheless\r\npublished an edict ordering the civil authorities to seize his books, and\r\nto prevent more from being printed, published, or sold, and that such an\r\nedict threw doubts upon the value of the safe conduct.(214) But he\r\nprobably did not know that this edict was a third draft issued by the\r\nEmperor without consulting the Diet. Nor is it likely that he knew how\r\nAleander had been working day and night to prevent his appearance at the\r\nDiet from being more than a mere formality, nor how far the nuncio had\r\nprevailed with the Emperor and with his councillors. His friends could\r\ntell him all this—though even they were not aware until next morning how\r\nresolved the Emperor was that Luther should not be permitted to make a\r\nspeech.(215) They knew enough, however, to be able to impress on Luther\r\nthat he must restrain himself, and act in such a way as to force the hands\r\nof his opponents, and gain permission to speak at length in a second\r\naudience. The Estates wished to hear him if the Emperor and his entourage\r\nhad resolved to prevent him from speaking. These consultations probably\r\nsettled the tactics which Luther followed on his first appearance before\r\nthe Diet.(216)\r\n\r\nNext morning (Wednesday, April 17th), Ulrich von Pappenheim, the marshal\r\nof ceremonies, came to Luther’s room before ten o’clock, and, greeting him\r\ncourteously and with all respect, informed him that he was to appear\r\nbefore the Emperor and the Diet that day at four o’clock, when he would be\r\ninformed why he had been summoned.(217) Immediately after the marshal had\r\nleft, there came an urgent summons from a Saxon noble, Hans von Minkwitz,\r\nwho was dying in his lodgings, that Luther would come to hear his\r\nconfession and administer the sacrament to him. Luther instantly went to\r\nsoothe and comfort the dying man, notwithstanding his own troubles.(218)\r\nWe have no information how the hours between twelve and four were spent.\r\nIt is almost certain that there must have been another consultation.\r\nSpalatin and Brück had discovered that the conduct of the audience was not\r\nto be in the hands of Glapion, the confessor of the Emperor, as they had\r\nup to that time supposed, but in those of John Eck, the Orator or Official\r\nof the Archbishop of Trier.(219) This looked badly for Luther. Eck had\r\nbeen officiously busy in burning Luther’s books at Trier; he lodged in the\r\nsame house and in the room next to the papal nuncio.(220) Aleander,\r\nindeed, boasts that Eck was entirely devoted to him, and that he had been\r\nable to draft the question which Eck put to Luther during the first\r\naudience.(221)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 5. Luther’s first Appearance before the Diet of Worms.(222)\r\n\r\n\r\nA little before four o’clock, the marshal and Caspar Sturm, the herald,\r\ncame to Luther’s lodging to escort him to the audience hall. They led the\r\nReformer into the street to conduct him to the Bishop’s Palace, where the\r\nEmperor was living along with his younger brother Ferdinand, afterwards\r\nKing of the Romans and Emperor, and where the Diet met.(223) The streets\r\nwere thronged; faces looked down from every window; men and women had\r\ncrowded the roofs to catch a glimpse of Luther as he passed. It was\r\ndifficult to force a way through the crowd, and, besides, Sturm, who was\r\nresponsible for Luther’s safety, feared that some Spaniard might deal the\r\nReformer a blow with a dagger in the crowd. So the three turned into the\r\ncourt of the Swan Hotel; from it they got into the garden of the House of\r\nthe Knights of St. John; and, as most of the courts and gardens of the\r\nhouses communicated with each other, they were able to get into the court\r\nof the Bishop’s Palace without again appearing on the street.(224)\r\n\r\nThe court of the Palace was full of people eager to see Luther, most of\r\nthem evidently friendly. It was here that old General Frundsberg, the most\r\nillustrious soldier in Germany, who was to be the conqueror in the famous\r\nfight at Pavia, clapped Luther kindly on the shoulder, and said words\r\nwhich have been variously reported. “My poor monk! my little monk! thou\r\nart on thy way to make a stand as I and many of my knights have never done\r\nin our toughest battles. If thou art sure of the justice of thy cause,\r\nthen forward in the name of God, and be of good courage: God will not\r\nforsake thee.” From out the crowd, “here and there and from every corner,\r\ncame voices saying, ‘Play the man! Fear not death; it can but slay the\r\nbody: there is a life beyond.’ ”(225) They went up the stair and entered\r\nthe audience hall, which was crammed. While the marshal and the herald\r\nforced a way for Luther, he passed an old acquaintance, the deputy from\r\nAugsburg. “Ah, Doctor Peutinger,” said Luther, “are you here too?”(226)\r\nThen he was led to where he was to stand before the Emperor; and these two\r\nlifelong opponents saw each other for the first time. “The fool entered\r\nsmiling,” says Aleander (perhaps the lingering of the smile with which he\r\nhad just greeted Dr. Peutinger): “he looked slowly round, and his face\r\nsobered.” “When he faced the Emperor,” Aleander goes on to say, “he could\r\nnot hold his head still, but moved it up and down and from side to\r\nside.”(227) All eyes were fixed on Luther, and many an account was written\r\ndescribing his appearance. “A man of middle height,” says an unsigned\r\nSpanish paper preserved in the British Museum, “with a strong face, a\r\nsturdy build of body, with eyes that scintillated and were never still. He\r\nwas clad in the robe of the Augustinian Order, but with a belt of hide,\r\nwith a large tonsure, newly shaven, and a coronal of short thick\r\nhair.”(228) All noticed his gleaming eyes; and it was remarked that when\r\nhis glance fell on an Italian, the man moved uneasily in his seat, as if\r\n“the evil eye was upon him.” Meanwhile, in the seconds before the silence\r\nwas broken, Luther was making _his_ observations. He noticed the swarthy\r\nJewish-looking face of Aleander, with its gleam of hateful triumph. “So\r\nthe Jews must have looked at Christ,” he thought.(229) He saw the young\r\nEmperor, and near him the papal nuncios and the great ecclesiastics of the\r\nEmpire. A wave of pity passed through him as he looked. “He seemed to me,”\r\nhe said, “like some poor lamb among swine and hounds.”(230) There was a\r\ntable or bench with some books upon it. When Luther’s glance fell on them,\r\nhe saw that they were his own writings, and could not help wondering how\r\nthey had got there.(231) He did not know that Aleander had been collecting\r\nthem for some weeks, and that, at command of the Emperor, he had handed\r\nthem over to John Eck, the Official of Trier, for the purposes of the\r\naudience.(232) Jerome Schurf made his way to Luther’s side, and stood\r\nready to assist in legal difficulties.\r\n\r\nThe past and the future faced each other—the young Emperor in his rich\r\nrobes of State, with his pale, vacant-looking face, but “carrying more at\r\nthe back of his head than his countenance showed,” the descendant of long\r\nlines of kings, determined to maintain the beliefs, rites, and rules of\r\nthat Mediæval Church which his ancestors had upheld; and the monk, with\r\nhis wan face seamed with the traces of spiritual conflict and victory, in\r\nthe poor dress of his Order, a peasant’s son, resolute to cleave a way for\r\nthe new faith of evangelical freedom, the spiritual birthright of all men.\r\n\r\nThe strained silence(233) was broken by the Official of Trier, a man of\r\nlofty presence, saying, in a clear, ringing voice so that all could hear\r\ndistinctly, first in Latin and then in German:\r\n\r\n\r\n    “ ‘Martin Luther, His Imperial Majesty, Sacred and Victorious\r\n    (_sacra et invicta_), on the advice of all the Estates of the Holy\r\n    Roman Empire, has ordered you to be summoned here to the throne of\r\n    His Majesty, in order that you may recant and recall, according to\r\n    the force, form, and meaning of the citation-mandate decreed\r\n    against you by His Majesty and communicated legally to you, the\r\n    books, both in Latin and in German, published by you and spread\r\n    abroad, along with their contents: Wherefore I, in the name of His\r\n    Imperial Majesty and of the Princes of the Empire, ask you: First,\r\n    Do you confess that these books exhibited in your presence (I show\r\n    him a bundle of books written in Latin and in German) and now\r\n    named one by one, which have been circulated with your name on the\r\n    title-page, are yours, and do you acknowledge them to be yours?\r\n    Secondly, Do you wish to retract and recall them and their\r\n    contents, or do you mean to adhere to them and to reassert\r\n    them?’ ”(234)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe books were not named; so Jerome Schurf called out, “Let the titles be\r\nread.”(235) Then the notary, Maximilian Siebenberger (called\r\nTransilvanus),(236) stepped forward and, taking up the books one by one,\r\nread their titles and briefly described their contents.(237) Then Luther,\r\nhaving briefly and precisely repeated the two questions put to him, said:\r\n\r\n\r\n    “ ‘To which I answer as shortly and correctly as I am able. I\r\n    cannot deny that the books named are mine, and I will never deny\r\n    any of them:(238) they are all my offspring; and I have written\r\n    some others which have not been named.(239) But as to what\r\n    follows, whether I shall reaffirm in the same terms all, or shall\r\n    retract what I may have uttered beyond the authority of\r\n    Scripture,—because the matter involves a question of faith and of\r\n    the salvation of souls, and because it concerns the Word of God,\r\n    which is the greatest thing in heaven and on earth, and which we\r\n    all must reverence,—it would be dangerous and rash in me to make\r\n    any unpremeditated declaration, because in unpremeditated speech I\r\n    might say something less than the fact and something more than the\r\n    truth; besides, I remember the saying of Christ when He declared,\r\n    “Whosoever shall deny Me before men, him will I also deny before\r\n    My Father which is in heaven, and before His angels.” For these\r\n    reasons I beg, with all respect, that your Imperial Majesty give\r\n    me time to deliberate, that I may answer the question without\r\n    injury to the Word of God and without peril to my own\r\n    soul.’ ”(240)\r\n\r\n\r\nLuther made his answer in a low voice—so low that the deputies from\r\nStrassburg, who were sitting not far from him, said that they could not\r\nhear him distinctly.(241) Many present inferred from the low voice that\r\nLuther’s spirit was broken, and that he was beginning to be afraid. But\r\nfrom what followed it is evident that Luther’s whole procedure on this\r\nfirst appearance before the Diet was intended to defeat the intrigues of\r\nAleander, which had for their aim to prevent the Reformer addressing the\r\nDiet in a long speech; and in this he succeeded, as Brück and Spalatin\r\nhoped he would.\r\n\r\nThe Estates then proceeded to deliberate on Luther’s request. Aleander\r\nsays that the Emperor called his councillors about him; that the Electors\r\ntalked with each other; and that the separate Estates deliberated\r\nseparately.(242) We are informed by the report of the Venetian ambassadors\r\nthat there was some difficulty among some of them in acceding to Luther’s\r\nrequest. But at length the Official of Trier again addressed Luther:\r\n\r\n\r\n    “ ‘Martin, you were able to know from the imperial mandate why you\r\n    were summoned here, and therefore you do not really require any\r\n    time for further deliberation, nor is there any reason why it\r\n    should be granted. Yet His Imperial Majesty, moved by his natural\r\n    clemency, grants you one day for deliberation, and you will appear\r\n    here tomorrow at the same hour,—but on the understanding that you\r\n    do not give your answer in writing, but by word of mouth.’ ”(243)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe sitting, which, so far as Luther was concerned, had occupied about an\r\nhour, was then declared to be ended, and he was conducted back to his room\r\nby the herald. There he sat down and wrote to his friend Cuspinian in\r\nVienna “from the midst of the tumult”:\r\n\r\n\r\n    “This hour I have been before the Emperor and his brother, and\r\n    have been asked whether I would recant my books. I have said that\r\n    the books were really mine, and have asked for some delay about\r\n    recantation. They have given me no longer space and time than till\r\n    to-morrow for deliberation. Christ helping me, I do not mean to\r\n    recant one jot or tittle.”(244)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 6. Luther’s Second Appearance before the Diet.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe next day, Thursday, April 18th, did not afford much time for\r\ndeliberation. Luther was besieged by visitors. Familiar friends came to\r\nsee him in the morning; German nobles thronged his hostel at midday; Bucer\r\nrode over from the Ebernberg in the afternoon with congratulations on the\r\nway that the first audience had been got through, and bringing letters\r\nfrom Ulrich von Hutten. His friends were almost astonished at his\r\ncheerfulness. “He greeted me and others,” said Dr. Peutinger, who was an\r\nearly caller, “quite cheerfully—‘Dear Doctor,’ he said, ‘how is your wife\r\nand child?’ I have never found or seen him other than the right good\r\nfellow he is.”(245) George Vogler and others had “much pious conversation”\r\nwith him, and wrote, praising his thorough heroism.(246) The German nobles\r\ngreeted Luther with a bluff heartiness—“Herr Doctor, How are you? People\r\nsay you are to be burnt; that will never do; that would ruin\r\neverything.”(247)\r\n\r\nThe marshal and the herald came for Luther a little after four o’clock,\r\nand led him by the same private devious ways to the Bishop’s Palace. The\r\ncrowds on the streets were even larger than on the day before. It was said\r\nthat more than five thousand people, Germans and foreigners, were crushed\r\ntogether in the street before the Palace. The throng was so dense that\r\nsome of the delegates, like Oelhafen from Nürnberg, could not get through\r\nit.(248) It was six o’clock before the Emperor, accompanied by the\r\nElectors and princes, entered the hall. Luther and the herald had been\r\nkept waiting in the court of the Palace for more than an hour and a half,\r\nbruised by the dense moving crowd. In the hall the throng was so great\r\nthat the princes had some difficulty in getting to their seats, and found\r\nthemselves uncomfortably crowded when they reached them.(249) Two notable\r\nmen were absent. The papal nuncios refused to be present when a heretic\r\nwas permitted to speak. Such proceedings were the merest tomfoolery\r\n(_ribaldaria_), Aleander said. When Luther reached the door, he had still\r\nto wait; the princes were occupied in reaching their places, and it was\r\nnot etiquette for him to appear until they were seated.(250) The day was\r\ndarkening, and the gloomy hall flamed with torches.(251) Observers\r\nremarked Luther’s wonderful cheerful countenance as he made his way to his\r\nplace.(252)\r\n\r\nThe Emperor had intrusted the procedure to Aleander, to his confessor\r\nGlapion, and to John Eck, who had conducted the audience on the previous\r\nday.(253) The Official was again to have the conduct of matters in his\r\nhands. As soon as Luther was in his place, Eck “rushed into words”\r\n(_prorupit in verba_)(254) He began by recapitulating what had taken place\r\nat the first audience; and in saying that Luther had asked time for\r\nconsideration, he insinuated that every Christian ought to be ready at all\r\ntimes to give a reason for the faith that is in him, much more a learned\r\ntheologian like Luther. He declared that it was now time for Luther to\r\nanswer plainly whether he adhered to the contents of the books he had\r\nacknowledged to be his, or whether he was prepared to recant them. He\r\nspoke first in Latin and then in German, and it was noticed that his\r\nspeech in Latin was very bitter.(255)\r\n\r\nThen Luther delivered his famous speech before the Diet. He had freed\r\nhimself from the web of intrigue that Aleander had been at such pains to\r\nweave round him to compel him to silence, and stood forth a free German to\r\nplead his cause before the most illustrious audience the Fatherland could\r\noffer to any of its sons.\r\n\r\nBefore him was the Emperor and his brother Ferdinand, Archduke of Austria,\r\ndestined to be King of the Romans and Emperor in days to come, and beside\r\nthem, seated, all the Electors and the great Princes of the Empire, lay\r\nand ecclesiastical, among them four Cardinals. All round him standing, for\r\nthere was no space for seats, the Counts, Free Nobles and Knights of the\r\nEmpire, and the delegates of the great cities, were closely packed\r\ntogether.(256) Ambassadors and the political agents of almost all the\r\ncountries in Europe were there to swell the crowd—ready to report the\r\nissue of this momentous day. For all believed that whatever weighty\r\nbusiness for Germany was discussed at this Diet, the question raised by\r\nLuther was one of European importance, and affected the countries which\r\nthey represented. The rumour had gone about, founded mainly on the serene\r\nappearance of Luther, that the monk was about to recant;(257) and most of\r\nthe political agents earnestly hoped it might be true. That and that only\r\nwould end, they believed, the symptoms of disquiet which the governments\r\nof every land were anxiously watching.\r\n\r\nThe diligence of Wrede has collected and printed in the\r\n_Reichstagsakten_(258) several papers, all of which profess to give\r\nLuther’s speech; but they are mere summaries, some longer and some\r\nshorter, and give no indication of the power which thrilled the audience.\r\nIts effect must be sought for in the descriptions of the hearers.\r\n\r\nThe specimens of his books which had been collected by Aleander were so\r\nrepresentative that Luther could speak of all his writings. He divided\r\nthem into three classes. He had written books for edification which he\r\ncould truly say had been approved by all men, friends and foes alike, and\r\nit was scarcely to be expected that he, the author, should be the only man\r\nto recant the contents of such writings as even the Papal Bull had\r\ncommended. In a second class of writings he had attacked the papal tyranny\r\nwhich all Germany was groaning under; to recant the contents of these\r\nbooks would be to make stronger and less endurable the monstrous evil he\r\nhad protested against; he therefore refused to recall such writings; no\r\nloyal German could do so. He had also written against individual persons\r\nwho had supported the Papacy; it was possible that he had written too\r\nstrongly in some places and against some men; he was only a man and not\r\nGod, and was liable to make mistakes; he remembered how Christ, who could\r\nnot err, had acted when He was accused, and imitating Him, he was quite\r\nready, if shown to be wrong, by evangelical or prophetic witnesses, to\r\nrenounce his errors, and if he were convinced, he assured the Emperor and\r\nprinces assembled that he would be the first to throw his books into the\r\nfire. He dwelt upon the power of the word of God which must prevail over\r\neverything, and showed that many calamities in times past had fallen upon\r\nnations who had neglected its teachings and warnings. He concluded as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n\r\n    “I do not say that there is any need for my teaching or warning\r\n    the many princes before me, but the duty I owe to _my_ Germany\r\n    will not allow me to recant. With these words I commend myself to\r\n    your most serene Majesty and to your principalities, and humbly\r\n    beg that you will not permit my accusers to triumph over me\r\n    causelessly. I have spoken (_Dixi_).”\r\n\r\n\r\nLuther had spoken in Latin; he was asked to repeat what he had said in\r\nGerman. The Hall had been packed; the torches gave forth warmth as well as\r\nlight. Luther steamed with perspiration, and looked wan and overpowered;\r\nthe heat was intense. Friends thought that the further effort would be too\r\nmuch for his strength. The Saxon councillor, Frederick von Thun,\r\nregardless of etiquette, called out loudly, “If you cannot do it you have\r\ndone enough, Herr Doctor.”(259) But Luther went on and finished his\r\naddress in German. His last words were. “Here I stand (_Hic bin Ich_).”\r\n\r\nAleander, the papal nuncio, who was not present, relates that while Luther\r\nwas speaking of the books in which he had attacked the Papacy, and was\r\nproceeding “with great venom” to denounce the Pope,(260) the Emperor\r\nordered him to pass from that subject and to proceed with his other\r\nmatters. The Emperor had certainly told the Estates that he would not\r\nallow the question of Luther’s orthodoxy and complaints against the Holy\r\nSee to be discussed together; and that lends some support to Aleander’s\r\nstatement.(261) But when it is seen that not one of the dozen deputies\r\npresent who write accounts of the scene mentions the interruption; when it\r\nis not found in the official report; when it is remembered that Charles\r\ncould not understand either German or Latin, the story of the interruption\r\nis a very unlikely one. Aleander was not remarkable for his veracity—“a\r\nman, to say the least, not bigotedly truthful (_non superstitiose verax_)”\r\nsays Erasmus;(262) and the nuncio on one occasion boasted to his masters\r\nin Rome that he could lie well when occasion required it.(263)\r\n\r\nSeveral letters descriptive of the scene, written by men who were present\r\nin the Diet, reveal the intense interest taken by the great majority of\r\nthe audience in the appearance and speech of Luther. His looks, his\r\nlanguage, the attitude in which he stood, are all described. When artists\r\nportray the scene, either on canvas or in bronze, Luther is invariably\r\nrepresented standing upright, his shoulders squared, and his head thrown\r\nback. That was not how he stood before Charles and the Diet. He was a\r\nmonk, trained in the conventional habits of monkish humility. He stood\r\nwith a stoop of the head and shoulders, with the knees slightly bent, and\r\nwithout gestures. The only trace of bodily emotion was betrayed by bending\r\nand straightening his knees.(264) He addressed the Emperor and the Estates\r\nwith all respect,—“Most serene Lord and Emperor, most illustrious Princes,\r\nmost clement Lords,”—and apologised for any lack of etiquette on the\r\nground that he was convent-bred and knew nothing of the ways of Courts;\r\nbut it was noticed by more than one observer that he did not address the\r\nspiritual princes present.(265) Many a witness describes the charm of his\r\ncheerful, modest, but undaunted bearing.(266) The Saxon official account\r\nsays, “Luther spoke simply, quietly, modestly, yet not without Christian\r\ncourage and fidelity—in such a way, too, that his enemies would have\r\ndoubtless preferred a more abject spirit and speech”; and it goes on to\r\nrelate that his adversaries had confidently counted on a recantation, and\r\nthat they were correspondingly disappointed.(267) Many expected that, as\r\nhe had never before been in such presence, the strange audience would have\r\ndisconcerted him; but, to their surprise and delight, he spoke\r\n“confidently, reasonably, and prudently, as if he were in his own\r\nlecture-room.”(268) Luther himself was surprised that the unaccustomed\r\nsurroundings affected him so little. “When it came to my turn,” he says,\r\n“I just went on.”(269) The beauty of his diction pleased his\r\naudience—“many fair and happy words,” say Dr. Peutinger and others.(270)\r\n\r\nWhen Luther had finished, the Official, mindful that it was his duty to\r\nextract from Luther a distinct recantation, addressed him in a threatening\r\nmanner (_increpabundo similis_), and told him that his answer had not been\r\nto the point. The question was that Luther, in some of his books, denied\r\ndecisions of Councils: Would he reaffirm or recant what he had said about\r\nthese decisions? the Emperor demanded a plain (_non cornutum_) answer. “If\r\nHis Imperial Majesty desires a plain answer,” said Luther, “I will give it\r\nto him, _neque cornutum neque dentatum_, and it is this: It is impossible\r\nfor me to recant unless I am proved to be in the wrong by the testimony of\r\nScripture or by evident reasoning; I cannot trust either the decisions of\r\nCouncils or of Popes, for it is plain that they have not only erred, but\r\nhave contradicted each other. My conscience is thirled to the word of God,\r\nand it is neither safe nor honest to act against one’s conscience. God\r\nhelp me! Amen!”(271)\r\n\r\nWhen he had finished, the Emperor and the princes consulted together; then\r\nat a sign from Charles,(272) the Official addressed Luther at some length.\r\nHe told him that in his speech he had abused the clemency of the Emperor,\r\nand had added to his evil deeds by attacking the Pope and Papists\r\n(_papistæ_) before the Diet. He briefly recapitulated Luther’s speech, and\r\nsaid that he had not sufficiently distinguished between his books and his\r\nopinions; there might be room for discussion had Luther brought forward\r\nanything new, but his errors were old—the errors of the Poor Men of Lyons,\r\nWiclif, of John and Jerome Huss (the learned Official gave Huss a brother\r\nunknown to history),(273) which were decided upon at the Council of\r\nConstance, where the whole German nation had been gathered together; he\r\nagain asked him to retract such opinions. To this Luther replied as\r\nbefore, that General Councils had erred, and that his conscience did not\r\nallow him to retract. By this time the torches had burnt to their sockets,\r\nand the hall was growing dark.(274) Wearied with the crowd and the heat,\r\nnumbers were preparing to leave. The Official, making a last effort,\r\ncalled out loudly, “Martin, let your conscience alone; recant your errors\r\nand you will be safe and sound; you can never show that a Council has\r\nerred.” Luther declared that Councils had erred, and that he could prove\r\nit.(275) Upon this the Emperor made a sign to end the matter.(276) The\r\nlast words Luther was heard to say were, “God come to my help” (_Got kum\r\nmir zu hilf_).(277)\r\n\r\nIt is evident from almost all the reports that from the time that Luther\r\nhad finished his great speech there was a good deal of confusion, and\r\nprobably of conversation, among the audience. All that the greater portion\r\nof those present heard was an altercation between Luther and the Official,\r\ndue, most of the Germans thought, to the overbearing conduct of Eck, and\r\nwhich the Italians and Spaniards attributed to the pertinacity of\r\nLuther.(278) “Luther asserted that Councils had erred several times, and\r\nhad given decisions against the law of God. The Official said No; Luther\r\nsaid Yes, and that he could prove it. So the matter came to an end for\r\nthat time.”(279) But all understood that there was a good deal said about\r\nthe Council of Constance.\r\n\r\nThe Emperor left his throne to go to his private rooms; the Electors and\r\nthe princes sought their hotels. A number of Spaniards, perceiving that\r\nLuther turned to leave the tribunal, broke out into hootings, and followed\r\n“the man of God with prolonged howlings.”(280) Then the Germans, nobles\r\nand delegates from the towns, ringed him round to protect him, and as they\r\npassed from the hall they all at once, and Luther in the midst of them,\r\nthrust forward arms and raised hands high above their heads, in the way\r\nthat a German knight was accustomed to do when he had unhorsed his\r\nantagonist in the tourney, or that a German landsknecht did when he had\r\nstruck a victorious blow. The Spaniards rushed to the door shouting after\r\nLuther, “To the fire with him, to the fire!”(281) The crowd on the street\r\nthought that Luther was being sent to prison, and thought of a\r\nrescue.(282) Luther calmed them by saying that the company were escorting\r\nhim home. Thus, with hands held high in stern challenge to Holy Roman\r\nEmpire and mediæval Church, they accompanied Luther to his lodging.\r\n\r\nFriends had got there before him—Spalatin, ever faithful; Oelhafen, who\r\nhad not been able to reach his place in the Diet because of the throng.\r\nLuther, with beaming face, stretched out both his hands, exclaiming, “I am\r\nthrough, I am through!”(283) In a few minutes Spalatin was called away. He\r\nsoon returned. The old Elector had summoned him only to say, “How well,\r\nfather, Dr. Luther spoke this day before the Emperor and the Estates; but\r\nhe is too bold for me.” The sturdy old German prince wrote to his brother\r\nJohn, “From what I have heard this day, I will never believe that Luther\r\nis a heretic”; and a few days later, “At this Diet, not only Annas and\r\nCaiaphas, but also Pilate and Herod, have conspired against Luther.”\r\nFrederick of Saxony was no Lutheran, like his brother John and his nephew\r\nJohn Frederick; and he was the better able to express what most German\r\nprinces were thinking about Luther and his appearance before the Diet.\r\nEven Duke George was stirred to a momentary admiration; and Duke Eric of\r\nBrunswick, who had taken the papal side, could not sit down to supper\r\nwithout sending Luther a can of Einbecker beer from his own table.(284) As\r\nfor the commonalty, there was a wild uproar in the streets of Worms that\r\nnight—men cursing the Spaniards and Italians, and praising Luther, who had\r\ncompelled the Emperor and the prelates to hear what he had to say, and who\r\nhad voiced the complaints of the Fatherland against the Roman Curia at the\r\nrisk of his life. The voice of the people found utterance in a placard,\r\nwhich next morning was seen posted up on the street corners of the town,\r\n“Woe to the land whose king is a child.” It was the beginning of the\r\ndisillusion of Germany. The people had believed that they were securing a\r\nGerman Emperor when, in a fit of enthusiasm, they had called upon the\r\nElectors to choose the grandson of Maximilian. They were beginning to find\r\nthat they had selected a Spaniard.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 7. The Conferences.\r\n\r\n\r\nNext day (April 19th) the Emperor proposed that Luther should be placed\r\nunder the ban of the Empire. The Estates were not satisfied, and insisted\r\nthat something should be done to effect a compromise. Luther had not been\r\ntreated as they had proposed in their memorandum of the 19th February. He\r\nhad been peremptorily ordered to retract. The Emperor had permitted\r\nAleander to regulate the order of procedure on the day previous (April\r\n18th), and the result had not been satisfactory. Even the Elector of\r\nBrandenburg and his brother, the hesitating Archbishop of Mainz, did not\r\nwish matters to remain as they were. They knew the feelings of the German\r\npeople, if they were ignorant of the Emperor’s diplomatic dealings with\r\nthe Pope. The Emperor gave way, but told them that he would let them hear\r\nhis own view of the matter. He produced a sheet of paper, and read a short\r\nstatement prepared by himself in the French tongue—the language with which\r\nCharles was most familiar. It was the memorable declaration of his own\r\nreligious position, which has been referred to already.(285) Aleander\r\nreports that several of the princes became pale as death when they heard\r\nit.(286) In later discussions the Emperor asserted with warmth that he\r\nwould never change one iota of his declaration.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, the Diet appointed a Commission (April 22nd) to confer with\r\nLuther, and at its head was placed the Archbishop of Trier, who was\r\nperhaps the only one among the higher ecclesiastics of Germany whom Luther\r\nthoroughly trusted. They had several meetings with the Reformer, the first\r\nbeing on the 24th of April. All the members of the Commission were\r\nsincerely anxious to arrange a compromise; but after the Emperor’s\r\ndeclaration that was impossible, as Luther himself clearly saw. No set of\r\nresolutions, however skilfully framed, could reconcile the Emperor’s\r\nbelief that a General Council was infallible and Luther’s phrase, “a\r\nconscience bound to the Holy Scriptures.” No proposals to leave the final\r\ndecision to the Emperor and the Pope, to the Emperor alone, to the Emperor\r\nand the Estates, to a future General Council (all of which were made),\r\ncould patch up a compromise between two such contradictory standpoints.\r\nCompromise must fail in a fight of faiths, and that was the nature of the\r\nopposition between Charles V. and Luther throughout their lives. What\r\ndivided them was no subordinate question about doctrine or ritual; it was\r\nfundamental, amounting to an entirely different conception of the whole\r\nround of religion. The moral authority of the individual conscience\r\nconfronted the legal authority of an ecclesiastical assembly. In after\r\ndays the monk regretted that he had not spoken out more boldly before the\r\nDiet. Shortly before his death, the Emperor expressed his regret that he\r\nhad not burned the obstinate heretic. When the Commission had failed,\r\nLuther asked leave to reveal his whole innermost thoughts to the\r\nArchbishop of Trier, under the seal of confession, and the two had a\r\nmemorable private interview. Aleander fiercely attacked the Archbishop for\r\nrefusing to disclose what passed between them; but the prelate was a\r\nGerman bishop with a conscience, and not an unscrupulous dependant on a\r\nshameless Curia. No one knew what Luther’s confession was. The Commission\r\nhad to report that its efforts had proved useless. Luther was ordered to\r\nleave Worms and return to Wittenberg, without preaching on the journey;\r\nhis safe conduct was to expire in twenty-one days after the 26th of April.\r\nAt their expiry he was liable to be seized and put to death as a pestilent\r\nheretic. There remained only to draft and publish the edict containing the\r\nban. The days passed, and it did not appear.\r\n\r\nSuddenly the startling news reached Worms that Luther had disappeared, no\r\none knew where. Aleander, as usual, had the most exact information, and\r\ngives the fullest account of the rumours which were flying about.\r\nCochlæus, who was at Frankfurt, sent him a man who had been at Eisenach,\r\nhad seen Luther’s uncle, and had been told by him about the capture. Five\r\nhorsemen had dashed at the travelling waggon, had seized Luther, and had\r\nridden off with him. Who the captors were or by whose authority they had\r\nacted, no one could tell. “Some blame me,” says Aleander, “others the\r\nArchbishop of Mainz: would God it were true!” Some thought that Sickingen\r\nhad carried him off to protect him; others, the Elector of Saxony; others,\r\nthe Count of Mansfeld. One persistent rumour declared that a personal\r\nenemy of the Elector of Saxony, one Hans Beheim, had been the captor; and\r\nthe Emperor rather believed it. On May 14th a letter reached Worms saying\r\nthat Luther’s body had been found in a silver-mine pierced with a dagger.\r\nThe news flew over Germany and beyond it that Luther had been done to\r\ndeath by emissaries of the Roman Curia; and so persistent was the belief,\r\nthat Aleander prepared to justify the deed by alleging that the Reformer\r\nhad broken the imperial safe conduct by preaching at Eisenach and by\r\naddressing a concourse of people at Frankfurt.(287) Albert Dürer, in\r\nGhent, noted down in his private diary that Luther, “the God-inspired\r\nman,” had been slain by the Pope and his priests as our Lord had been put\r\nto death by the priests in Jerusalem. “O God, if Luther is dead, who else\r\ncan expound the Holy Gospel to us!”(288) Friends wrote distracted letters\r\nto Wittenberg imploring Luther to tell them whether he was alive or\r\nimprisoned.(289) The news created the greatest consternation and\r\nindignation in Worms. The Emperor’s decision had been little liked even by\r\nthe princes most incensed against Luther. Aleander could not get even the\r\nArchbishop of Mainz to promise that he would publish it. When the\r\nCommission of the Diet had failed to effect a compromise, the doors of the\r\nRathhaus and of other public buildings in Worms had been placarded with an\r\nintimation that four hundred knights had sworn that they would not leave\r\nLuther unavenged, and the ominous words _Bundschuh_, _Bundschuh_,\r\n_Bundschuh_ had appeared on it. The Emperor had treated the matter\r\nlightly; but the German Romanist princes had been greatly alarmed.(290)\r\nThey knew, if he did not, that the union of peasants with the lower\r\nnobility had been a possible source of danger to Germany for nearly a\r\ncentury; they remembered that it was this combination which had made the\r\ngreat Bohemian rising successful. Months after the Diet had risen,\r\nRomanist partisans in Germany sent anxious communications to the Pope\r\nabout the dangers of a combination of the lesser nobility with the\r\npeasants.(291) The condition of Worms had been bad enough before, and when\r\nthe news of Luther’s murder reached the town the excitement passed all\r\nbounds. The whole of the Imperial Court was in an uproar. When Aleander\r\nwas in the royal apartments the highest nobles in Germany pressed round\r\nhim, telling him that he would be murdered even if he were “clinging to\r\nthe Emperor’s bosom.” Men crowded his room to give him information of\r\nconspiracies to slay both himself and the senior Legate Caraccioli.(292)\r\nThe excitement abated somewhat, but the wiser German princes recognised\r\nthe abiding gravity of the situation, and how little the Emperor’s\r\ndecision had done to end the Lutheran movement. The true story of Luther’s\r\ndisappearance was not known until long afterwards. After the failure of\r\nthe conferences, the Elector of Saxony summoned two of his councillors and\r\nhis chaplain and private secretary, Spalatin, and asked them to see that\r\nLuther was safely hidden until the immediate danger was past. They were to\r\ndo what they pleased and inform him of nothing. Many weeks passed before\r\nthe Elector and his brother John knew that Luther was safe, living in\r\ntheir own castle on the Wartburg. This was his “Patmos,” where he doffed\r\nhis monkish robes, let the hair grow over his tonsure, was clad as a\r\nknight, and went by the name of Junker Georg. His disappearance did not\r\nmean that he ceased to be a great leader of men; but it dates the\r\nbeginning of the national opposition to Rome.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 8. The Ban.\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter long delay, the imperial mandate against Luther was prepared. It was\r\npresented (May 25th) to an informal meeting of some members of the Diet\r\nafter the Elector of Saxony and many of Luther’s staunchest supporters had\r\nleft Worms.(293) Aleander, who had a large share in drafting it, brought\r\ntwo copies, one in Latin and the other in German, and presented them to\r\nCharles on a Sunday (May 26th) after service. The Emperor signed them\r\nbefore leaving the church. “Are you contented now?” said Charles, with a\r\nsmile to the Legate; and Aleander overflowed with thanks. Few State\r\ndocuments, won by so much struggling and scheming, have proved so futile.\r\nThe uproar in Germany at the report of Luther’s death had warned the\r\nGerman princes to be chary of putting the edict into execution.\r\n\r\nThe imperial edict against Luther threatened all his sympathisers with\r\nextermination. It practically proclaimed an Albigensian war in Germany.\r\nCharles had handed it to Aleander with a smile. Aleander despatched the\r\ndocument to Rome with an exultation which could only find due expression\r\nin a quotation from Ovid’s _Art of Love_. Pope Leo celebrated the arrival\r\nof the news by comedies and musical entertainments. But calm observers,\r\nforeigners in Germany, saw little cause for congratulation and less for\r\nmirth. Henry VIII. wrote to the Archbishop of Mainz congratulating him on\r\nthe overthrow of the “rebel against Christ”; but Wolsey’s agent at the\r\nDiet informed his master that he believed there were one hundred thousand\r\nGermans who were still ready to lay down their lives in Luther’s\r\ndefence.(294) Velasco, who had struck down the Spanish rebels in the\r\nbattle of Villalar, wrote to the Emperor that the victory was God’s\r\ngratitude for his dealings with the heretic monk; but Alfonso de Valdès,\r\nthe Emperor’s secretary, said in a letter to a Spanish correspondent:\r\n\r\n\r\n    “Here you have, as some imagine, the end of this tragedy; but I am\r\n    persuaded it is not the end, but the beginning of it. For I see\r\n    that the minds of the Germans are greatly exasperated against the\r\n    Roman See, and they do not seem to attach great importance to the\r\n    Emperor’s edicts; for since their publication, Luther’s books are\r\n    sold with impunity at every step and corner of the streets and\r\n    market-places. From this you will easily guess what will happen\r\n    when the Emperor leaves. This evil might have been cured with the\r\n    greatest advantage to the Christian commonwealth, had not the Pope\r\n    refused a General Council, had he preferred the public weal to his\r\n    own private interests. But while he insists that Luther shall be\r\n    condemned and burnt, I see the whole Christian commonwealth\r\n    hurried to destruction unless God Himself help us.”\r\n\r\n\r\nValdès, like Gattinara and other councillors of Charles, was a follower of\r\nErasmus. He lays the blame of all on the Pope. But what a disillusion this\r\nDiet of Worms ought to have been to the Erasmians! The Humanist young\r\nsovereigns and the Humanist Pope, from whom so much had been expected,\r\ncongratulating each other on Luther’s condemnation to the stake!\r\n\r\nThe foreboding of Alfonso de Valdès was amply justified. Luther’s books\r\nbecame more popular than ever, and the imperial edict did nothing to\r\nprevent their sale either within Germany or beyond it. Aleander was soon\r\nto learn this. He had retired to the Netherlands, and busied himself with\r\n_auto-da-fés_ of the prohibited writings; but he had to confess that they\r\nwere powerless to prevent the spread of Luther’s opinions, and he declared\r\nthat the only remedy would be if the Emperor seized and burnt half a dozen\r\nLutherans, and confiscated all their property.(295) The edict had been\r\npublished or repeated in lands outside Germany and in the family\r\npossessions of the House of Hapsburg. Henry VIII. ordered Luther’s books\r\nto be burnt in England;(296) the Estates of Scotland prohibited their\r\nintroduction into the realm under the severest penalties in 1525.(297) But\r\nsuch edicts were easily evaded, and the prohibited writings found their\r\nway into Spain, Italy, France, Flanders, and elsewhere, concealed in bales\r\nof merchandise. In Germany there was no need for concealment; the imperial\r\nedict was not merely disregarded, but was openly scouted. The great\r\nStrassburg publisher, Gruniger, apologised to his customers, not for\r\npublishing Luther’s books, but for sending forth a book against him; and\r\nCochlæus declared that printers gladly accepted any MS. against the\r\nPapacy, printed it _gratis_, and spent pains in issuing it with taste,\r\nwhile every defender of the established order had to pay heavily to get\r\nhis book printed, and sometimes could not secure a printer at any cost.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 9. Popular Literature.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Reformation movement may almost be said to have created the German\r\nbook trade. The earliest German printed books or rather booklets were few\r\nin number, and of no great importance—little books of private devotion, of\r\npopular medicine, herbals, almanacs, travels, or public proclamations. Up\r\nto 1518 they barely exceeded fifty a year. But in the years 1518-1523 they\r\nincreased enormously, and four-fifths of the increase were controversial\r\nwritings prompted by the national antagonism to the Roman Curia. This\r\nincrease was at first due to Luther alone;(298) but from 1521 onwards he\r\nhad disciples, fellow-workers, opponents, all using in a popular way the\r\nGerman language, the effective literary power of which had been discovered\r\nby the Reformer.(299) These writers spread the new ideas among the people,\r\nhigh and low, throughout Germany.(300)\r\n\r\nThere are few traces of combined action in the anti-Romanist writings in\r\nthe earlier stages of the controversy; it needed literary opposition to\r\ngive them a semblance of unity. Each writer looks at the general question\r\nfrom his own individual point of view. Luther is the hero with nearly all,\r\nand is spoken about in almost extravagant terms. He is the prophet of\r\nGermany, the Elias that was to come, the Angel of the Revelation “flying\r\nthrough the mid-heaven with the everlasting Gospel in his hands,” the\r\nnational champion who was brought to Worms to be silenced, and yet was\r\nheard by Emperor, princes, and papal nuncios. Some of the authors were\r\nstill inclined to make Erasmus their leader, and declared that they were\r\nfighting under the banner of that “Knight of Christ”; others looked on\r\nErasmus and Luther as fellow-workers, and one homely pamphlet compares\r\nErasmus to the miller who grinds the flour, and Luther to the baker who\r\nbakes it into bread to feed the people. Perhaps the most striking feature\r\nof the times was the appearance of numberless anonymous pamphlets,\r\npurporting to be written by the unlearned for the unlearned. They are\r\nmostly in the form of dialogues, and the scene of the conversations\r\nrecorded was often the village alehouse, where burghers, peasants,\r\nweavers, tailors, and shoemakers attack and vanquish in argument priests,\r\nmonks, and even bishops. One striking feature of this new popular\r\nliterature is the glorification of the German peasant. He is always\r\nrepresented as an upright, simple-minded, reflective, and intelligent\r\nperson skilled in Bible lore, and even in Church history, and knowing as\r\nmuch of Christian doctrine “as three priests and more.” He may be compared\r\nwith the idealised peasant of the pre-revolution literature in France,\r\nalthough he lacks the refinement, and knows nothing of high-flown moral\r\nsentiment; but he is much liker the Jak Upland or Piers Plowman of the\r\ndays of the English Lollards. Jak Upland and Hans Mattock (_Karsthans_),\r\nboth hate the clergy and abominate the monks and the begging friars, but\r\nthe German exhibits much more ferocity than the Englishman. The Lollard\r\ndescribes the fat friar of the earlier English days with his swollen\r\ndewlap wagging under his chin “like a great goose-egg,” and contrasts him\r\nwith the pale, poverty-stricken peasant and his wife, going shoeless to\r\nwork over ice-bound roads, their steps marked with the blood which oozed\r\nfrom the cut feet; the German pamphleteer pours out an endless variety of\r\nsavage nicknames—cheese-hunters, sausage-villains, begging-sacks, sourmilk\r\ncrocks, the devil’s fat pigs, etc. etc. It is interesting to note that\r\nmost of this coarse controversial literature, which appeared between 1518\r\nand 1523, came from those regions in South Germany where the social\r\nrevolution had found an almost permanent establishment from the year 1503.\r\nIt was the sign that the old spirit of communist and religious enthusiasm,\r\nwhich had shown itself spasmodically since the movement under Hans Böhm,\r\nhad never been extinguished, and it was a symptom that a peasants’ war\r\nmight not be far off. Very little was needed to kindle afresh the\r\nsmouldering hatred of the peasant against the priests. When German\r\npatriots declaimed against the exactions of the Roman Curia, the peasant\r\nthought of the great and lesser tithes, of the marriage, baptismal, and\r\nburial fees demanded from him by his own parish priest. When Reformers and\r\npopular preachers denounced the scandals and corruptions in the Church,\r\nthe peasant applied them to some drunken, evil-living, careless priest\r\nwhom he knew. It should be remembered that the character _Karsthans_ was\r\ninvented in 1520, not by a Lutheran sympathiser, but by Thomas Murner, one\r\nof Luther’s most determined opponents,(301) when he was still engaged in\r\nwriting against the clerical disorders of the times. This virulent attack\r\non priests and monks had other sources than the sympathy for Luther.(302)\r\nIt was the awakening of old memories, prompted partly by an underground\r\nceaseless Hussite propaganda, and partly, no doubt, by the new ideas so\r\nuniversally prevalent.\r\n\r\nSome of this coarse popular literature had a more direct connection with\r\nthe Lutheran movement. A booklet which appeared in 1521, entitled _The New\r\nand the Old God_, and which had an immense circulation, may be taken as an\r\nexample. Like many of its kind, it had an illustrated title-page, which\r\nwas a graphic summary of its contents. There appeared as the\r\nrepresentatives of the New God, the Pope, some Church Fathers, and beneath\r\nthem, Cajetan, Silvester Prierias, Eck, and Faber; over-against them were\r\nthe Old God as the Trinity, the four Evangelists, St. Paul with a sword,\r\nand behind him Luther. It attacked the ceremonies, the elaborate services,\r\nthe obscure doctrines which had been thrust on the Church by bloody\r\npersecutions, and had changed Christianity into Judaism, and contrasted\r\nthem with the unchanging Word of the Old God, with its simple story of\r\nsalvation and its simple doctrines of faith, hope, and love. To the same\r\nclass belong the writings of the voluminous controversialist, John Eberlin\r\nof Günzburg, whom his opponents accused of seducing whole provinces, so\r\neffective were his appeals to the “common” man. He began by a pamphlet\r\naddressed to the young Emperor, and published, either immediately before\r\nor during the earlier sitting of the Diet of Worms in 1521, a daring\r\nappeal, in which Luther and Ulrich von Hutten are called the messengers of\r\nGod to their generation. It was the first of a series of fifteen, all of\r\nwhich were in circulation before the beginning of November of the same\r\nyear.(303) They were called the “Confederates” (_Bundsgenossen_). The\r\ncontents of these and other pamphlets by Eberlin may be guessed from their\r\ntitles—_Of the forty days’ fast before Easter and others which pitifully\r\noppress Christian folk._ _An exhortation to all Christians that they take\r\npity on Nuns._ _How very dangerous it is that priests have not wives_ (the\r\nfrontispiece represents the marriage of a priest by a bishop, in the\r\nbackground the marriage of two monks, and two musicians on a raised seat).\r\n_Why there is no money in the country._ _Against the false clergy,\r\nbare-footed monks, and Franciscans_, etc., etc. He exposes as trenchantly\r\nas Luther did the systematic robbery of Germany to benefit the Roman\r\nCuria—300,000 gulden sent out of the country every year, and a million\r\nmore given to the begging friars. He wrote fiercely against the monks who\r\ntake to this life, because they were too lazy to work like honest people,\r\nand called them all sorts of nicknames—_cloister swine_, _the Devil’s\r\nlandsknechts_, etc., twenty-four thousand of them sponge on Germany and\r\nfour hundred thousand on the rest of Europe. He tells of a parish priest\r\nwho thought that he must really begin to read the Scriptures: his\r\nparishioners are reading it, the mothers to the children and the\r\nhouse-fathers to the household; they trouble him with questions taken from\r\nit, and he is often at his wit’s end to answer; he asked a friend where he\r\nought to begin, and was told that there was a good deal about priests and\r\ntheir duties in the Epistles to Timothy and Titus; he read, and was\r\nhorrified to find that bishops and priests ought to be “husbands of one\r\nwife,” etc. Eberlin had been a Franciscan monk, and was true to the\r\nrevolutionary traditions of his Order. He preached a social as well as an\r\nevangelical reformation. The Franciscan Order sent forth a good many\r\nReformers: men like Stephen Kampen, who had come to adopt views like those\r\nof Eberlin without any teaching but the leadings of his heart; or John\r\nBrissmann, a learned student of the Scholastic Theology, who like Luther\r\nhad found that it did not satisfy the yearnings of his soul; or like\r\nFrederick Mecum (Myconius), whose whole spiritual development was very\r\nsimilar to that of Luther. Pamphlets like those of Eberlin, and preaching\r\nlike that of Kampen, had doubtless some influence in causing popular\r\nrisings against the priests that were not uncommon throughout Germany in\r\n1521, after the Diet of Worms had ended its sittings—the Erfurt tumult,\r\nwhich lasted during the months of April, May, June, and July, may be\r\ninstanced as an example.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 10. The Spread of Luther’s Teaching.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt may be said that the very year in which the imperial edict against\r\nLuther was published (1521) gave evidence that a silent movement towards\r\nthe adoption of the principles for which Luther was testifying had begun\r\namong monks of almost all the different Orders. The Augustinian Eremites,\r\nLuther’s own Order, had been largely influenced by him. Whole communities,\r\nwith the prior at their head, had declared for the Reformation both in\r\nGermany and in the Low Countries. No other monastic Order was so decidedly\r\nupon the side of the Reformer, but monks of all kinds joined in preaching\r\nand teaching the new doctrines. Martin Bucer had been a Dominican, Otto\r\nBraunfells a Carthusian, Ambrose Blauer a Benedictine. The case of\r\nOecolampadius (John Hussgen (?) Hausschein) was peculiar. He had been a\r\ndistinguished Humanist, had come under serious religious impressions, and\r\nhad entered the Order of St. Bridget; but he was not long there when he\r\njoined the ranks of the Reformers, and was sheltered by Franz von\r\nSickingen in his castle at Ebernberg.(304) Urban Rhegius, John Eck’s most\r\ntrusted and most talented student at Ingolstadt, had become a Carmelite,\r\nand had quitted his monastery to preach the doctrines of Luther. John\r\nBugenhagen belonged to the Order of the Præmonstratenses. He was a learned\r\ntheologian. Luther’s struggle against Indulgences had displeased him. He\r\ngot hold of _The Babylonian Captivity of the Christian Church_, and\r\nstudied it for the purpose of refuting it. The study so changed him that\r\nhe felt that “the whole world may be wrong, but Luther is right”; he won\r\nover his prior and most of his companions, and became the Reformer of\r\nPomerania.\r\n\r\nSecular priests all over Germany declared for the new evangelical\r\ndoctrines. The Bishop of Samlund in East Prussia boldly avowed himself to\r\nbe on Luther’s side, and was careful to have the Lutheran doctrines\r\npreached throughout his diocese; and other bishops showed themselves\r\nfavourable to the new evangelical faith. Many of the most influential\r\nparish priests did the like, and their congregations followed them.\r\nSometimes the superior clergy forbade the use of the church, and the\r\npeople followed their pastor while he preached to them in the fields.\r\nSometimes (as in the case of Hermann Tast) the priest preached under the\r\nlime trees in the churchyard, and his parishioners came armed to protect\r\nhim. If priests were lacking to preach the Lutheran doctrines, laymen came\r\nforward. If they could not preach, they could sing hymns. Witness the poor\r\nweaver of Magdeburg, who took his stand near the statue of Kaiser Otto in\r\nthe market-place, and sang two of Luther’s hymns, “Aus tiefer Not schrei\r\nIch zu dir,” and “Es woll’ uns Gott gnädig sein,” while the people crowded\r\nround him on the morning of May 6th, 1524. The Burgermeister coming from\r\nearly Mass heard him, and ordered him to be imprisoned, but the crowd\r\nrescued him. Such was the beginning of the Reformation in Magdeburg.(305)\r\nWhen men dared not, women took their place. Argula Grunbach, a student of\r\nthe Scriptures and of Luther’s writings, challenged the University of\r\nIngolstadt, under the eyes of the great Dr. Eck himself, to a public\r\ndisputation upon the truth of Luther’s position.\r\n\r\nArtists lent their aid to spread the new ideas, and many cartoons made the\r\ndoctrines and the aims of the Reformers plain to the common people. These\r\npictures were sometimes used to illustrate the title-pages of the\r\ncontroversial literature, and were sometimes published as separate\r\nbroadsides. In one, Christ is portrayed standing at the _door_ of a house,\r\nwhich represents His Church. He invites the people to enter by the door;\r\nand Popes, cardinals, and monks are shown climbing the walls to get\r\nentrance in a clandestine fashion.(306) In another, entitled the _Triumph\r\nof Truth_, the common folk of a German town are represented singing songs\r\nof welcome to honour an approaching procession. Moses, the patriarchs, the\r\nprophets, and the apostles, carry on their shoulders the Ark of the Holy\r\nScriptures. Hutten comes riding on his warhorse, and to the tail of the\r\nhorse is attached a chain which encloses a crowd of ecclesiastics—an\r\narchbishop with his mitre fallen off, the Pope with his tiara in the act\r\nof tumbling and his pontifical staff broken; after them, cardinals, then\r\nmonks figured with the heads of cats, pigs, calves, etc. Then comes a\r\ntriumphal car drawn by the four living creatures, who represent the four\r\nevangelists, on one of which rides an angel. Carlstadt stands upright in\r\nthe front of the car; Luther strides alongside. In the car, Jesus sits\r\nsaying, _I am the Way, and the Truth, and the Life_. Holy martyrs follow,\r\nsinging songs of praise. German burghers are spreading their garments on\r\nthe road, and boys and girls are strewing the path with flowers.(307)\r\nPerhaps the most important work of this kind was the _Passional Christi et\r\nAntichristi_.(308) Luther planned the book, Luke Cranach designed the\r\npictures, and Melanchthon furnished the texts from Scripture and the\r\nquotations from Canon Law. It is a series of pairs of engravings\r\nrepresenting the lives of our Lord and of the Pope, so arranged that\r\nwherever the book opened two contrasting pictures could be seen at the\r\nsame time. The contrasts were such as these:—Jesus washing the disciples’\r\nfeet; the Pope holding out his toe to be kissed: Jesus healing the wounded\r\nand the sick; the Pope presiding at a tournament: Jesus bending under His\r\nCross; the Pope carried in state on men’s shoulders: Jesus driving the\r\nmoney-changers out of the Temple; the Pope and his servants turning a\r\nchurch into a market for Indulgences, and sitting surrounded with strong\r\nboxes and piles of coin. It was a “good book for the laity,” Luther said.\r\n\r\nOne of the signs of the times was the enthusiasm displayed in the imperial\r\ncities for the cause of Luther. The way had been prepared. Burgher songs\r\nhad for long described the ecclesiastical abuses, and had borne witness to\r\nthe widespread hatred of the clergy shared in by the townsfolk. Wolfgang\r\nCapito and Frederick Mecum (Myconius), both sons of burghers, inform us\r\nthat their fathers taught them when they were boys that Indulgences were\r\nnothing but a speculation on the part of cunning priests to get their\r\nhands into the pockets of simple-minded laity. Keen observers of the trend\r\nof public feeling like Wimpheling and Pirkheimer had noticed with some\r\nalarm the gradual spread of the Hussite propaganda in the towns, and had\r\nmade the fact one of their reasons for desiring and insisting on a\r\nreformation of the Church. The growing sympathy for the Hussite opinions\r\nin the cities is abundantly apparent. Some leading Reformers, Capito for\r\ninstance, told their contemporaries that they had frequently listened to\r\nHussite discourses when they were boys; and the libraries of burghers not\r\ninfrequently contained Hussite pamphlets. Men in the towns had been\r\nreading, thinking, and speaking in private to their familiar friends about\r\nthe disorders in the life and doctrine of the Church of their days, and\r\nwere eager to welcome the first symptoms of a genuine attempt at reform.\r\n\r\nThe number of editions of the German Vulgate, rude as many of these\r\nversions were, shows what a Bible-reading people the German burghers had\r\nbecome, enables us to wonder less at the way in which the controversial\r\nwriters assume that the laity knew as much of the Scriptures as the\r\nclergy, and lends credibility to contemporary assertions that women and\r\nartisans knew their Bibles better than learned men at the Universities.\r\n\r\nThese things make us understand how the townsmen were prepared to welcome\r\nLuther’s simple scriptural teaching, how his writings found such a sale\r\nall over Germany, how they could say that he taught what all men had been\r\nthinking, and said out boldly what all men had been whispering in private.\r\nThey explain how the burghers of Strassburg nailed Luther’s Ninety-five\r\nTheses to the doors of every church and parsonage in the city in 1518; how\r\nthe citizens of Constance drove away with threats the imperial messenger\r\nwho came to publish the Edict of Worms in their town; how the people of\r\nBasel applauded their pastor when he carried a copy of the Scriptures\r\ninstead of the Host in the procession on Corpus Christi Day; how the\r\nhigher clergy of Strassburg could not expel the nephew and successor of\r\nthe famed Geiler of Keysersberg although he was accused of being a\r\nfollower of Luther; and how his friend Matthew Zell, when he was\r\nprohibited from preaching in the pulpit from which Geiler had thundered,\r\nwas able to get carpenters to erect another in a corner of the great\r\ncathedral, from which he spoke to the people who crowded to hear him. When\r\nthe clergy persuaded the authorities in many towns (Goslar, Danzig, Worms,\r\netc.) to close the churches against the evangelical preachers, the\r\ntownspeople listened to their sermons in the open air; but generally from\r\nthe first the civic authorities sided with the people in welcoming a\r\npowerful evangelical preacher. Matthew Zell and, after him, Martin Bucer\r\nbecame the Reformers of Strassburg; Kettenbach and Eberlin, of Ulm;\r\nOecolampadius and Urbanus Rhegius, of Augsburg; Andrew Osiander, of\r\nNürnberg; John Brenz, of Hall, in Swabia; Theobald Pellicanus (Pellicanus,\r\n_i.e._ of Villigheim), of Nördlingen; Matthew Alber, of Reutlingen; John\r\nLachmann, of Heilbron; John Wanner, of Constance; and so on. The gilds of\r\n_Mastersingers_ welcomed the Reformation. The greatest of the civic poets,\r\nHans Sachs of Nürnberg, was a diligent collector and reader of Luther’s\r\nbooks. He published in 1523 his famous poem, “The Wittenberg Nightingale”\r\n(_Die Wittembergisch Nachtigall, Die man jetz höret überall_). The\r\nnightingale was Luther, and its song told that the moonlight with its pale\r\ndeceptive gleams and its deep shadows was passing away, and the glorious\r\nsun was rising. The author praises the utter simplicity of Luther’s\r\nscriptural teaching, and contrasts it with the quirks and subtleties of\r\nRomish doctrine. Even a peasant, he says, can understand and know that\r\nLuther’s teaching is good and sound. In a later short poem he contrasts\r\nevangelical and Romish preaching. The original edition was illustrated by\r\na woodcut showing two preachers addressing their respective audiences. The\r\none is saying, _Thus saith the Lord_; and the other, _Thus saith the\r\nPope_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 11. Andrew Bodenstein of Carlstadt.(309)\r\n\r\n\r\nEvery great movement for reform bears within it the seeds of revolution,\r\nof the “tumult,” as Erasmus called it, and Luther’s was no exception to\r\nthe general rule. Every Reformer who would carry through his reforming\r\nideas successfully has to struggle against men and circumstances making\r\nfor the “tumult,” almost as strenuously as against the abuses he seeks to\r\novercome. We have already seen how these germs of revolution abounded in\r\nGermany, and how the revolutionists naturally allied themselves with the\r\nReformer, and the cause he sought to promote.\r\n\r\nWhile Luther was hidden away in the Wartburg, the revolution seized on\r\nWittenberg. At first his absence did not seem to make any difference. The\r\nnumber of students had increased until it was over a thousand, and the\r\ntown itself surprised eye-witnesses who were acquainted with other\r\nUniversity towns in Germany. The students went about unarmed; they mostly\r\ncarried Bibles under their arms; they saluted each other as “brothers at\r\none in Christ.” No rift had yet appeared among the band of leaders,\r\nalthough his disappointment in not obtaining the Provostship of All Saints\r\nhad begun to isolate Andrew Bodenstein of Carlstadt. Unanimity did not\r\nmean dulness; Wittenberg was seething with intellectual life. Since its\r\nfoundation the University had been distinguished for weekly Public\r\nDisputations in which students and professors took part. In the earlier\r\nyears of its existence the theses discussed had been suggested by the\r\nScholastic Theology and Philosophy in vogue; but since 1518 the new\r\nquestions which were stirring Germany had been the subjects of debate, and\r\nthis had given a life and eagerness to the University exercises. When\r\nJustus Jonas came to Wittenberg from Erfurt, he wrote enthusiastically to\r\na friend about the “unbelievable wealth of spiritual interests in the\r\nlittle town of Wittenberg.” None of the professors took a keener interest\r\nin these Public Discussions than Andrew Bodenstein of Carlstadt. He had\r\nbeen a very successful teacher; had come under Luther’s magnetic\r\ninfluence; and had accepted the main ideas of the new doctrines. He had\r\nnot the full-blooded humanity of Luther, nor his sympathetic tact, nor his\r\npractical insight into how things would work. He lacked altogether\r\nLuther’s solid basis of conservative feeling, which made him know by\r\ninstinct that new ideas and new things could only flourish and grow if\r\nthey were securely rooted in what was old. It was enough for Carlstadt\r\nthat his own ideas, however hastily evolved, were clear, and his aims\r\nbeneficent, to make him eager to see them at once reduced to practice. He\r\nhad the temperament of a revolutionary rather than that of a Reformer.\r\n\r\nHe was strongly impressed with the fundamental contradictions which he\r\nbelieved to exist between the new evangelical doctrines preached by Luther\r\nand the theories and practices of the mediæval religious life and worship.\r\nThis led him to attack earnestly and bitterly monastic vows, celibacy, a\r\ndistinctive dress for the clergy, the idea of a propitiatory sacrifice in\r\nthe Mass, and the presence and use of images and pictures in the churches.\r\nHe introduced all these questions of practical interest into the\r\nUniversity weekly Public Discussions; he published theses upon them; he\r\nprinted two books—one on monastic vows and the other on the Mass—which had\r\nan extensive circulation both in German and in Latin (four editions were\r\nspeedily exhausted). The prevailing idea in all these publications,\r\nperhaps implied rather than expressed, was that the new evangelical\r\nliberty could only be exercised when everything which suggested the\r\nceremonies and usages of the mediæval religious life was swept away. His\r\nstrongest denunciations were reserved for the practice of celibacy; he\r\ndwelt on the divine institution of marriage, its moral and spiritual\r\nnecessity, and taught that the compulsory marriage of the clergy was\r\nbetter than the enforced celibacy of the mediæval Church. Zwilling, a\r\nyoung Augustinian Eremite, whose preaching gifts had been praised by\r\nLuther, went even further than Carlstadt in his fiery denunciation of the\r\nMass as an idolatrous practice.\r\n\r\nThe movement to put these exhortations in practice began first among the\r\nclergy. Two priests in parishes near Wittenberg married; several monks\r\nleft their cloisters and donned lay garments; Melanchthon and several of\r\nhis students, in semi-public fashion, communicated in both kinds in the\r\nparish church on Michaelmas Day (Sept. 29th), 1521, and his example seems\r\nto have been followed by other companies.\r\n\r\nZwilling’s fiery denunciations of the idolatry of the Mass stirred the\r\ncommonalty of the town. On Christmas Eve (Dec. 24-25), 1521, a turbulent\r\ncrowd invaded the parish church and the Church of All Saints. In the\r\nformer they broke the lamps, threatened the priests, and in mockery of the\r\nworship of praise they sang folk-songs, one of which began: “There was a\r\nmaid who lost a shoe”—so the indignant clergy complained to the\r\nElector.(310)\r\n\r\nNext day, Christmas, Carlstadt, who was archdeacon, conducted the service\r\nin All Saints’ Church. He had doffed his clerical robes, and wore the\r\nordinary dress of a layman. He preached and then dispensed the Lord’s\r\nSupper in an “evangelical fashion.” He read the usual service, but omitted\r\neverything which taught a propitiatory sacrifice; he did not elevate the\r\nHost; and he placed the Bread in the hands of every communicant, and gave\r\nthe Cup into their hands. On the following Sundays and festival days the\r\nSacrament of the Supper was dispensed in the same manner, and we are told\r\nthat “hic pæne urbs et cuncta civitas communicavit sub utraque specie.”\r\n\r\nDuring the closing days of the year 1521, so full of excitement for the\r\npeople of Wittenberg, three men, known in history as the _Zwickau\r\nProphets_, came to the town (Dec. 27th). Zwickau, lying about sixty-four\r\nmiles south of Wittenberg, was the centre of the weaving trade of Saxony,\r\nand contained a large artisan population. We have seen that movements of a\r\nreligious-communistic kind had from time to time appeared among the German\r\nartisans and peasants since 1476. Nicolaus Storch, a weaver in Zwickau,\r\nproclaimed that he had visions of the Angel Gabriel, who had revealed to\r\nhim: “Thou shalt sit with me on my throne.” He began to preach. Thomas\r\nMünzer, who had been appointed by the magistrates to be town preacher in\r\nSt. Mary’s, the principal church in Zwickau, praised his discourses,\r\ndeclaring that Storch expounded the Scriptures better than any priest.\r\nSome writers have traced the origin of this Zwickau movement to Hussite\r\nteachings. Münzer allied himself with the extreme Hussites _after_ the\r\nmovement had begun, and paid a visit to Bohemia, taking with him some of\r\nhis intimates; but our sources of information, which are scanty, do not\r\nwarrant any decided opinion about the origin of the outbreak in Zwickau.\r\nAfter some time Storch and others were forced to leave the town. Three of\r\nthem went to Wittenberg—Storch himself, the seer of heavenly visions,\r\nanother weaver, and Marcus Thomä Stubner, who had once been a pupil of\r\nMelanchthon, and was therefore able to introduce his companions to the\r\nWittenberg circle of Reformers. Their arrival and addresses increased the\r\nexcitement both in the town and in the University. Melanchthon welcomed\r\nhis old pupil, and was impressed by the presence of a certain spiritual\r\npower in Stubner and in his companions. Some of their doctrines, however,\r\nespecially their rejection of infant baptism, repelled him, and he\r\ngradually withdrew from their companionship.\r\n\r\nCarlstadt took advantage of the strong excitement in Wittenberg to press\r\non the townspeople and on the magistrates his scheme of reformation; and\r\non Jan. 24th, 1522, the authorities of the town of Wittenberg published\r\ntheir famous ordinance.\r\n\r\nThis document, the first of numerous civic and territorial attempts to\r\nexpress the new evangelical ideas in legislation, deserves careful\r\nstudy.(311) It concerns itself almost exclusively with the reform of\r\nsocial life and of public worship. It enjoins the institution of a common\r\nchest to be under the charge of two of the magistrates, two of the\r\ntownsmen, and a public notary. Into this the revenues from ecclesiastical\r\nfoundations were to be placed, the annual revenues of the guilds of\r\nworkmen, and other specified monies. Definite salaries were to be paid to\r\nthe priests, and support for the poor and for the monks was to be taken\r\nfrom this common fund. Begging, whether by ordinary beggars, monks, or\r\npoor students, was strictly prohibited. If the common chest was not able\r\nto afford sufficient for the support of the helpless and orphans, the\r\ntownsfolk had to provide what was needed. No houses of ill-fame were\r\nallowed within the town. Churches were places for preaching; the town\r\ncontained enough for the population; and the building of small chapels was\r\nprohibited. The service of the Mass was shortened, and made to express the\r\nevangelical meaning of the sacrament, and the elements were to be placed\r\nin the hands of the communicants. All this was made law within the town of\r\nWittenberg; and the reformation was to be enforced. Not content with these\r\nregulations, Carlstadt engaged in a crusade against the use of pictures\r\nand images in the churches (the regulations had permitted three altars in\r\nevery church and one picture for each altar). Everything which recalled\r\nthe older religious usages was to be done away with, and flesh was to be\r\neaten on fast days.\r\n\r\nThis excitement bred fanaticism. Voices were raised declaring that, as all\r\ntrue Christians were taught by the Spirit of God, there was no need either\r\nfor civil rulers or for carnal learning. It is believed by many that\r\nCarlstadt shared these fancies, and it has been said that in his desire to\r\n“simplify” himself, he dressed as a peasant and worked as a labourer (he\r\nhad married) on his father-in-law’s farm. It is more probable that he\r\nfound himself unable to rule the storm his hasty measures had raised, and\r\nthat he saw many things proposed with which he had no sympathy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 12. Luther back in Wittenberg.\r\n\r\n\r\nMelanchthon felt himself helpless in presence of the “tumult,” declared\r\nthat no one save Luther himself could quell the excitement, and eagerly\r\npressed his return. The revolutionary movement was extending beyond\r\nWittenberg, in other towns in Electoral Saxony such as Grimma and\r\nAltenberg. Duke George of Saxony, the strenuous defender of the old faith,\r\nhad been watching the proceedings from the beginning. As early as Nov.\r\n21st, 1521, he had written to John Duke of Saxony, the brother of the\r\nElector, warning him that, against ecclesiastical usage, the Sacrament of\r\nthe Supper was being dispensed in both kinds in Wittenberg; he had\r\ninformed him (Dec. 26th) that priests were threatened while saying the\r\nMass; he had brought the “tumultuous deeds” in Electoral Saxony before the\r\n_Reichsregiment_ in January, with the result that imperial mandates were\r\nsent to the Elector Frederick and to the Bishops of Meissen, Merseburg,\r\nand Naumburg, requiring them to take measures to end the disturbances. The\r\nElector was seriously disquieted. His anxieties were increased by a letter\r\nfrom Duke George (Feb. 2nd, 1522), declaring that Carlstadt and Zwilling\r\nwere the instigators of all the riotous proceedings. He had commissioned\r\none of his councillors, Hugold of Einsiedel, to try to put matters right;\r\nbut the result had been small. It was probably in these circumstances that\r\nhe wrote his _Instruction_ to Oswald, a burgher of Eisenach, with the\r\nintention that the contents should be communicated to Luther in the\r\nWartburg. The _Instruction_ may have been the reason why Luther suddenly\r\nleft the asylum where he had remained since his appearance at Worms by the\r\ncommand and under the protection of his prince.(312)\r\n\r\nIf this _Instruction_ did finally determine him, it was only one of many\r\nthings urging Luther to leave his solitude. He cared little for the\r\ninfluence of the Zwickau Prophets,(313) estimating them at their true\r\nvalue, but the weakness of Melanchthon, the destructive and dangerous\r\nimpetuosity of Carlstadt, the spread of the tumult beyond Wittenberg, the\r\ndetermination of Duke George to make use of these outbursts to destroy the\r\nwhole movement for reformation, and the interference of the\r\n_Reichsregiment_ with its mandates, made him feel that the decisive moment\r\nhad come when he must be again among his own people.\r\n\r\nHe started on his lonely journey, most of it through an enemy’s country,\r\ngoing by Erfurt, Jena, Borna, and Leipzig. He was dressed as “Junker\r\nGeorg,” with beard on his chin and sword by his side. At Erfurt he had a\r\ngood-humoured discussion with a priest in the inn; and Kessler, the Swiss\r\nstudent, tells how he met a stranger sitting in the parlour of the “Bear”\r\nat Jena with his hand on the hilt of his sword, and reading a small Hebrew\r\nPsalter. He got to Wittenberg on Friday, March 7th; spent that afternoon\r\nand the next day in discussing the situation with his friends Amsdorf,\r\nMelanchthon, and Jerome Schurf.(314)\r\n\r\nOn Sunday he appeared in the pulpit, and for eight successive days he\r\npreached to the people, and the plague was stayed. Many things in the\r\nmovement set agoing by Carlstadt met with his approval. He had come to\r\nbelieve in the marriage of the clergy; he disapproved strongly of private\r\nMasses; he had grave doubts on the subject of monastic vows; but he\r\ndisapproved of the violence, of the importance attached to outward\r\ndetails, and of the use of force to advance the Reformation movement:\r\n\r\n\r\n    “The Word created heaven and earth and all things; the same Word\r\n    will also create now, and not we poor sinners. _Summa summarum_, I\r\n    will preach it, I will talk about it, I will write about it, but I\r\n    will not use force or compulsion with anyone; for faith must be of\r\n    freewill and unconstrained, and must be accepted without\r\n    compulsion. To marry, to do away with images, to become monks or\r\n    nuns, or for monks and nuns to leave their convents, to eat meat\r\n    on Friday or not to eat it, and other like things—all these are\r\n    open questions, and should not be forbidden by any man. If I\r\n    employ force, what do I gain? Changes in demeanour, outward shows,\r\n    grimaces, shams, hypocrisies. But what becomes of the sincerity of\r\n    the heart, of faith, of Christian love? All is wanting where these\r\n    are lacking; and for the rest I would not give the stalk of a\r\n    pear. What we want is the heart, and to win that we must preach\r\n    the gospel. Then the word will drop into one heart to-day, and\r\n    to-morrow into another, and so will work that each will forsake\r\n    the Mass.”\r\n\r\n\r\nHe made no personal references; he blamed no individuals; and in the end\r\nhe was master of the situation.\r\n\r\nWhen he had won back Wittenberg he made a tour of those places in\r\nElectoral Saxony where the Wittenberg example had been followed. He went\r\nto Zwickau, to Altenberg, and to Grimma—preaching to thousands of people,\r\ncalming them, and bringing them back to a conservative reformation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter IV. From The Diet of Worms to the Close Of the Peasants’ War.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 1. The continued spread of Lutheran Teaching.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe imperial edict issued against Luther at the Diet of Worms could\r\nscarcely have been stronger than it was,(315) and yet, like many another\r\nedict of Emperor and Diet, it was wholly ineffective. It could only be\r\nenforced by the individual Estates, who for the most part showed great\r\nreluctance to put it into operation. It was published in the territories\r\nof Archduke Ferdinand of Austria, of the Elector of Brandenburg, of Duke\r\nGeorge of Saxony, and of the Dukes of Bavaria; but none of these princes,\r\nexcept the Archduke and Duke George, seemed to care much for the old\r\nreligion. In most of the ecclesiastical States the authorities were afraid\r\nof riots following the publication, and did nothing. Thus, in Bremen, we\r\nare told that as late as December 1522 the people had never seen the\r\nedict. The cities treated it as carelessly. The authorities in Nürnberg,\r\nUlm, Augsburg, and Strassburg posted it up publicly as an official\r\ndocument, and took no further trouble. In Strassburg the printers went on\r\nissuing Luther’s books and tracts as fast as their printing-presses could\r\nproduce them; and at Constance the populace drove the imperial\r\ncommissioners from the town when they came to publish the edict.\r\n\r\nThe action of the newly constituted _Reichsregiment_ was as indecisive.\r\nWhen the disturbances broke out at Wittenberg, under Carlstadt and the\r\nZwickau Prophets, Duke George, by playing on the fears of a spread of\r\nHussitism, could get mandates issued to the Elector of Saxony and\r\nneighbouring bishops to inquire into and crush the disorders; but after\r\nLuther’s return and the restoration of tranquillity his pleadings were\r\nineffectual. It was in vain that he insisted that Luther’s presence in\r\nWittenberg was an insult to the Empire. He was told that the\r\n_Reichsregiment_ was able to judge for itself what were insults, and that\r\nwhen they saw them they would punish. Archduke Ferdinand, the President,\r\ndoubtless sympathised with Duke George, but he was powerless; the Elector\r\nof Saxony had the greatest influence, and it was always exerted on the\r\nside of Luther.\r\n\r\nIn January 1522 a new Pope had been chosen, who took the title of Adrian\r\nVI. His election was a triumph for the party that confessed the urgent\r\nneed of reforms, and thought that they ought to be effected by the\r\nhierarchy and from within the Church. Adrian was a pious man according to\r\nhis lights, one who felt deeply the corruption which was degrading the\r\nChurch. He believed that the revolt of Luther was a punishment sent by God\r\nfor the sins of the generation. He had been the tutor of Charles V., and\r\nascended the papal throne with the determination to reform corruptions,\r\nand to begin his reforms by attacking the source of all—the Roman Curia.\r\nBut he was a Dominican monk, and had all the Dominican ideas about the\r\nneed of maintaining mediæval theology intact, and about the strict\r\nmaintenance of ecclesiastical discipline. He was as ignorant as his\r\npredecessor of the state of matters in Germany, and regarded Luther as\r\nanother Mahomet, who was seducing men from the higher Christian life by\r\npandering to their fleshly appetites.\r\n\r\nThe _Reichsregiment_ met with the Diet at Nürnberg in 1522-1523, and to\r\nthis Diet the Pope sent, as nuncio, Francesco Chieregati, Bishop of\r\nTerramo, in the kingdom of Naples. The nuncio was given lengthy\r\ninstructions, which set forth the Pope’s opinion of the corruptions in the\r\nChurch and his intention to cure them, but which demanded the delivery of\r\nLuther into the hands of the Roman Curia, and the punishment of priests,\r\nmonks, and nuns who had broken their vows of celibacy.(316) Chieregati was\r\nno sooner in Germany than he understood that it would be impossible for\r\nhim to get the Pope’s demand carried out, and he informed his master of\r\nthe state of matters. When he met the Diet and presented the papal\r\nrequests, he was practically answered that Germany had grievances against\r\nRome, and that they would need to be set right ere the Curia could expect\r\nto get its behests fulfilled. They intimated that since the Pope had\r\nadmitted the corruptions in the Church, it was scarcely to be expected\r\nthat they should blame Luther for having pointed them out. They presented\r\nthe nuncio with a list of one hundred German grievances against the Roman\r\nCuria;(317) and suggested that the most convenient way of settling them\r\nwould be for the Pope to make over immediately, for the public use of\r\nGermany, the German _annates_,(318) and that a German Council should be\r\nheld on German soil, and within one of the larger German cities.\r\n\r\nThe practical result of this fencing at the Diet of 1522, repeated in\r\n1523, was that the progress of the Lutheran movement was not checked. How\r\ndeeply the people of Germany had drunk in the teaching of Luther may be\r\nlearnt from the letters of the nuncio to the Curia, and from those of the\r\nArchduke Ferdinand to the Emperor. Both use the same expression, that\r\n“among a thousand men scarcely one could be found untainted by Lutheran\r\nteaching.”\r\n\r\nAdrian VI. died suddenly after a few months’ reign, and the next Pope,\r\nClement VII., a Medici and completely under the influence of the French\r\nking, belonged to the old unreforming party, whose only desire was to\r\nmaintain all the corrupting privileges of the Roman Curia. He selected and\r\nsent to Germany, as his nuncio, Lorenzo Campeggio, one of the ablest of\r\nItalian diplomatists, to negotiate with the _Reichsregiment_ and the Diet\r\nwhich met at Speyer in 1524.\r\n\r\nCampeggio, like his predecessor, found that the German Nation was\r\ndeterminedly hostile to Rome. When he made his official entry into\r\nAugsburg, and raised his hands to give the usual benediction to the crowds\r\nof people, they received the blessing with open derision. He was so\r\nimpressed with their attitude, that when he reached Nürnberg he doffed his\r\nofficial robes and entered the town as quietly as possible; indeed he\r\nreceived a message from the authorities asking him “to avoid making the\r\nsign of the cross, or using the benediction, seeing how matters then\r\nstood.” The presence of the Legate seemed to increase the anti-papal zeal\r\nof the people. The Pope was openly spoken of as Antichrist. Planitz, the\r\nenergetic commissary of the Elector of Saxony, reckoned that nearly four\r\nthousand people in the city partook of the Sacrament of the Supper in both\r\nkinds, and informs us that among them were members of the\r\n_Reichsregiment_, and Isabella, Queen of Sweden, the sister of the\r\nEmperor.\r\n\r\nYet the experienced Italian diplomatist thought that he could discern\r\nsigns more favourable to his master than the previous Diet had exhibited.\r\nThe _Reichsregiment_, which had hitherto shielded the Lutheran movement,\r\nhad lost the confidence of many classes of people, and was tottering to\r\nits fall. It had showed itself unable to enforce the Lands-Peace. It was\r\nthe princes who had defeated the rising of the Free Nobles under Franz von\r\nSickingen; it was the Swabian League, an association always devoted to the\r\nHouse of Austria, that had crushed the Franconian robber nobles; and both\r\nprinces and League were irritated at the attempts of the _Reichsregiment_,\r\nwhich had endeavoured to rob them of the fruits of their successes. The\r\ncities had been made to bear all the taxation needed to support the\r\ncentral government, and the system of monopolies arising from combinations\r\namong the great commercial houses had been threatened. The cities and the\r\ncapitalists had made a secret agreement with the Emperor, and von Hannart\r\nhad been sent by the Emperor from Spain to the Diet of 1524 to work along\r\nwith the towns for the overthrow of the central government. The Diet\r\nitself had passed a vote of no confidence in the government. In these\r\ntroubled waters a crafty fisher might win some success.\r\n\r\nHis success was more apparent than real. The Diet of 1524 did not\r\nabsolutely refuse to enforce the Edict of Worms against Luther and his\r\nfollowers; they promised to execute it “as well as they were able, and as\r\nfar as was possible,” and the cities had made it plain that the\r\nenforcement was impossible. They renewed their demand for a General\r\nCouncil to meet in a suitable German town to settle the affairs of the\r\nChurch in Germany, and again declared that meanwhile nothing should be\r\npreached contrary to the Word of God and the Holy Gospel. They went\r\nfurther, and practically resolved that a National Council, to deliberate\r\non the condition of the Church in Germany, should meet at Speyer in\r\nNovember and make an interim settlement of its ecclesiastical affairs, to\r\nlast until the meeting of a General Council. It is true that, owing to the\r\nexertions of the nuncio and of von Hannart, the phrase National Synod was\r\nomitted, and the meeting was to be one of the Estates of Germany at which\r\nthe councillors and learned divines of the various princes were to\r\nformulate all the disputed points, and to consider anew the grievances of\r\nthe German nation against the Papacy; but neither the nuncio nor von\r\nHannart deceived themselves as to the real meaning of the resolution. “It\r\nwill be a National Council for Germany,” said Hannart in his report.\r\nNothing could be more alarming to the Pope. There was always a possibility\r\nof managing a General Council; but a German National Synod, including a\r\nlarge number of lay representatives, meeting in a German town,\r\nforeshadowed an independent National German Church which would insist on\r\nseparation from the Roman See. The Pope wrote to Henry VIII. of England\r\nasking him to harass the German merchants; he induced the Emperor to\r\nforbid the proposed meeting of the German States; and, what was more\r\nimportant, he instructed his nuncio to take steps secretly to form a\r\nleague of German princes who were still favourable to maintaining the\r\nmediæval Church with its doctrines, ceremonies, and usages. This\r\ninaugurated the religious divisions of Germany.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 2. The beginnings of Division in Germany.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Diet of Speyer (1524) may perhaps be taken as the beginning of the\r\nseparation of Germany into two opposite camps of Protestant and Roman\r\nCatholic, although the real parting of the ways actually occurred after\r\nthe Peasants’ War. The overthrow, or at least discrediting of the\r\n_Reichsregiment_, placed the management of everything, including the\r\nsettlement of the religious question, in the hands of the princes, none of\r\nwhom, with the exception of the Elector of Saxony, cared much for the idea\r\nof nationality; while some of them, however anxious they were, or once had\r\nbeen, for ecclesiastical reforms, were genuinely afraid of the “tumult”\r\nwhich they believed might lurk behind any conspicuous changes in religious\r\nusages. Duke George of Saxony, who was keenly alive to the corruptions in\r\nthe Church, dreaded above all things the beginnings of a Hussite movement\r\nin Germany. He knew that an assiduous, penetrating, secret Hussite, or\r\nrather Taborite propaganda had been going on in Germany for long. As early\r\nas the Leipzig Disputation (1519), when John Eck had skilfully forced\r\nLuther into the avowal that he approved of some things in the Hussite\r\nrevolt, Duke George was seen to put his arms akimbo, to wag his long\r\nbeard, and was heard to ejaculate, “God help us! The plague!” A fear of\r\nHussite revolution displays itself in his correspondence, and very notably\r\nin his letters to Duke John of Saxony and to the Elector about the\r\ndisturbances in Wittenberg. It was a triumph for the Roman Curia when its\r\npartisans, from Eck onwards, were able to fix the stigma of Hussitism on\r\nthe Lutheran movement; and the career of the Zwickau Prophets,\r\nnotwithstanding their suppression by Luther, was, to many, an indication\r\nof what might lie behind the new preaching. When the Peasants’ War came in\r\n1525, many of the earlier sympathisers with Luther saw in it an indication\r\nof the dangers into which they fancied that Luther was leading Germany. It\r\nis also to be noticed that many of the Humanists now began to desert the\r\nLutheran cause; his Augustinian theology made them think that he was bent\r\non creating a new Scholastic which seemed to them almost as bad as the\r\nold, which they had been delighted to see him attack.\r\n\r\nThe Roman Curia was quick to take advantage of all these alarms. Its\r\nefforts were so successful, that it was soon able to create a Roman\r\nCatholic Party among the South German princes, and to secure its\r\nsteadfastness by promising a few concessions, and by permitting the\r\nauthorities to retain for the secular uses of their States about one-fifth\r\nof the ecclesiastical revenues in each State. The leading States in this\r\nRoman Catholic federation were Austria and Bavaria, and so long as Duke\r\nGeorge lived, Ducal Saxony in middle Germany. This naturally called forth\r\na distinctly Lutheran party, no longer national, which included the\r\nElector of Saxony, the Landgrave of Hesse, the Margraf of Brandenburg, his\r\nbrother Albert, and many others. Albert was at the head of the Teutonic\r\nOrder in East Prussia. He secularised his semi-ecclesiastical\r\nprincipality, became the first Duke of Prussia, and his State from the\r\nbeginning adopted the evangelical faith.\r\n\r\nIt was not until the Peasants’ War was over that this division was clearly\r\nmanifested. The Reformation had spread in simple natural fashion, without\r\nany attempt at concerted action, or any design to impose a new and uniform\r\norder of public worship, or to make changes in ecclesiastical government.\r\nLuther himself was not without hopes that the great ecclesiastical\r\nprincipalities might become secular lordships, that the bishops would\r\nassume the lead in ecclesiastical reform, and that there would be a great\r\nNational Church in Germany, with little external change—enough only to\r\npermit the evangelical preaching and teaching. It is true that the Emperor\r\nhad shown clearly his position by sending martyrs to the stake in the\r\nNetherlands, and that symptoms of division had begun to manifest\r\nthemselves during 1524, as we have seen. Still these things did not\r\nprevent such an experienced statesman as the Elector of Saxony from\r\nconfidently expecting a peaceful and, so far as Germany was concerned, a\r\nunanimous and hearty solution of the religious difficulties. The storm\r\nburst suddenly which was to shatter these optimistic expectations, and to\r\nchange fundamentally the whole course of the Lutheran Reformation. This\r\nwas the Peasants’ War.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 3. The Peasants’ War.(319)\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom one point of view this insurrection was simply the last, the most\r\nextensive, and the most disastrous of those revolts which, we have already\r\nseen, had been almost chronic in Germany during the later decades of the\r\nfifteenth and in the beginning of the sixteenth century. All the social\r\nand economic causes which produced them(320) were increasingly active in\r\n1524-1525. It is easy to show, as many Lutheran Church historians have\r\ndone with elaborate care, that the Reformation under Luther had nothing in\r\ncommon with the sudden and unexpected revolt,—as easy as to prove that\r\nthere was little in common between the “Spiritual Poverty” of Francis of\r\nAssisi and the vulgar communism of the _Brethren and Sisters of the Free\r\nSpirit_, between the doctrines of Wiclif and the gigantic labour strike\r\nheaded by Wat Tyler and Priest Ball, between the teaching of Huss and the\r\nextreme Taborite fanatics. But the fact remains that the voice of Luther\r\nawoke echoes whereof he never dreamt, and that its effects cannot be\r\nmeasured by some changes in doctrine, or by a reformation in\r\necclesiastical organisation. The times of the Reformation were ripe for\r\nrevolution, and the words of the bold preacher, coming when all men were\r\nrestless and most men were oppressed, appealing especially to those who\r\nfelt the burden heavy and the yoke galling, were followed by\r\nfar-resounding reverberations. Besides, Luther’s message was democratic.\r\nIt destroyed the aristocracy of the saints, it levelled the barriers\r\nbetween the layman and the priest, it taught the equality of all men\r\nbefore God, and the right of every man of faith to stand in God’s presence\r\nwhatever be his rank and condition of life. He had not confined himself to\r\npreaching a new theology. His message was eminently practical. In his\r\n_Appeal to __ the Nobility of the German Nation_, Luther had voiced all\r\nthe grievances of Germany, had touched upon almost all the open sores of\r\nthe time, and had foretold disasters not very far off.\r\n\r\nNor must it be forgotten that no great leader ever flung about wild words\r\nin such a reckless way. Luther had the gift of strong smiting phrases, of\r\nwords which seemed to cleave to the very heart of things, of images which\r\nlit up a subject with the vividness of a flash of lightning. He launched\r\ntracts and pamphlets from the press about almost everything,—written for\r\nthe most part on the spur of the moment, and when the fire burned. His\r\nwords fell into souls full of the fermenting passions of the times. They\r\ndrank in with eagerness the thoughts that all men were equal before God,\r\nand that there are divine commands about the brotherhood of mankind of\r\nmore importance than all human legislation. They refused to believe that\r\nsuch golden ideas belonged to the realm of spiritual life alone, or that\r\nthe only prescriptions which denied the rights of the common man were the\r\ndecrees of the Roman Curia. The successful revolts of the Swiss peasants,\r\nthe wonderful victories of Zisca, the people’s leader, in the near\r\nBohemian lands, were illustrations, they thought, of how Luther’s\r\nsledge-hammer words could be translated into corresponding deeds.\r\n\r\nOther teachings besides Luther’s were listened to. Many of the Humanists,\r\nprofessed disciples of Plato, expounded to friends or in their class-rooms\r\nthe communistic dreams of the _Republic_, and published _Utopias_ like the\r\nbrilliant sketch of the ideal commonwealth which came from the pen of\r\nThomas More. These speculations “of the Chair” were listened to by the\r\n“wandering students,” and were retailed, with forcible illustrations, in a\r\nway undreamt of by their scholarly authors, to audiences of artisans and\r\npeasants who were more than ready to give them unexpected\r\napplications.(321)\r\n\r\nThe influence of popular astrology must not be forgotten; for the\r\nastrologists were powerful among all classes of society, in the palaces of\r\nthe princes, in the houses of the burghers, and at the peasant market\r\ngatherings and church ales. In these days they were busy pointing out\r\nheavenly portents, and foretelling calamities and popular risings.(322)\r\n\r\nThe missionaries of the movement belonged to all sorts and conditions of\r\nmen—poor priests sympathising with the grievances of their parishioners;\r\nwandering monks who had deserted their convents, especially those\r\nbelonging to the Franciscan Order; poor students on their way from\r\nUniversity to University; artisans, travelling in German fashion from one\r\ncentre of their trade to another. They found their audiences on the\r\nvillage greens under the lime trees, or in the public-houses in the lower\r\nparts of the towns. They talked the rude language of the people, and\r\ngarnished their discourse with many a scriptural quotation. They read to\r\nexcited audiences small pamphlets and broadsides, printed in thick letters\r\non coarse paper, which discussed the burning questions of the day.\r\n\r\nThe revolt began unexpectedly, and without any pre-concerted preparation\r\nor formulation of demands, in June 1524, when a thousand peasants\r\nbelonging to the estate of Count Sigismund of Lupfen rose in rebellion\r\nagainst their lord at Stühlingen, a few miles to the north-west of\r\nSchaffhausen, and put themselves under the leadership of Hans Müller, an\r\nold landsknecht. Müller led his peasants, one of them carrying a flag\r\nblazoned with the imperial colours of red, black, and yellow, to the\r\nlittle town of Waldshut, about half-way between Schaffhausen and Basel.\r\nThe people of the town fraternised with the peasants, and the formidable\r\n“Evangelical Brotherhood” was either formed then or the roots of it were\r\nplanted. The news spread fast, east and west. The peasants of the\r\ndistricts round about the Lake of Constance—in the Allgau, the Klettgau,\r\nthe Hegau, and Villingen—rose in rebellion. The revolt spread northwards\r\ninto Lower Swabia, and the peasants of Leiphen, led by Jacob Wehe, were\r\njoined by some of the troops of Truchsess, the general of the Swabian\r\nLeague. The peasants of Salzburg, Styria, and the Tyrol rose. These three\r\neastern risings had most staying power in them. The Salzburg peasants\r\nbesieged the Cardinal Archbishop in his castle; they were not reduced till\r\nthe spring of 1526, and only after having extorted concessions from their\r\nover-lords. The Tyrolese peasants, under their wise leader, Michael\r\nGaismeyer, shut up Archduke Ferdinand in Innsbruck, and in the end gained\r\nsubstantial concessions. The rising in Styria was a very strong one; it\r\nlasted till 1526, and was eventually put down by bringing Bohemian troops\r\ninto the country. From Swabia the flames of insurrection spread into\r\nFranconia, where a portion of the insurgents were led by an escaped\r\ncriminal, the notorious Jäklein Rohrbach. It was this band which\r\nperpetrated the wanton massacre of Weinsberg, the one outstanding atrocity\r\nof the insurrection. The band and the deed were repudiated by the rest of\r\nthe insurgents. Thomas Münzer, who, banished from Zwickau and then from\r\nAlstedt, had settled in Mühlhausen, his heart aflame with the wrongs of\r\nthe commonalty, preached insurrection to the peasants in Thüringen. He\r\nissued fiery proclamations:\r\n\r\n\r\n    “Arise! Fight the battle of the Lord! On! On! On! The wicked\r\n    tremble when they hear of you. On! On! On! Be pitiless although\r\n    Esau gives you fair words (Gen. xxxiii.). Heed not the groans of\r\n    the godless; they will beg, weep, and entreat you for pity like\r\n    children. Show them no mercy, as God commanded to Moses (Deut.\r\n    vii.), and as He has revealed the same to us. Rouse up the towns\r\n    and the villages; above all, rouse the miners.... On! On! On!\r\n    while the fire is burning let not the blood cool on your swords!\r\n    Smite pinke-pank on the anvil of Nimrod! Overturn their towers to\r\n    the foundation: while one of them lives you will not be free from\r\n    the fear of man. While they reign over you it is of no use to\r\n    speak of the fear of God. On! while it is day! God is with you.”\r\n\r\n\r\nThe words were meant to rouse the miners of Mansfeld. They failed in their\r\noriginal intention, but they sent bands of armed insurgents through\r\nThüringen and the Harz, and within fourteen days about forty convents and\r\nmonasteries were destroyed, and the inmates (many of them poor women with\r\nno homes to return to) were sent adrift.\r\n\r\nThe revolt spread like a conflagration, one province catching fire from\r\nanother, until in the early spring months of 1525 almost all Germany was\r\nin uproar. The only districts which escaped were Bavaria in the south,\r\nHesse, and the north and north-east provinces. The insurgents were not\r\npeasants only. The poorer population of many of the towns fraternised with\r\nthe insurgents, and compelled the civic authorities to admit them within\r\ntheir walls.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 4. The Twelve Articles.\r\n\r\n\r\nStatements of grievances were published which, naturally, bore a strong\r\nresemblance to those issued in the earlier social uprisings. The\r\ncountrymen complained of the continuous appropriation of the woodlands by\r\nthe proprietors, and that they were not allowed to fish in the streams or\r\nto kill game in their fields. They denounced the proprietors’ practice of\r\ncompelling his peasants to do all manner of unstipulated service for him\r\nwithout payment—to repair his roads, to assist at his hunts, to draw his\r\nfish-ponds. They said that their crops were ruined by game which they were\r\nnot allowed to kill, and by hunters in pursuit of game; that the landlord\r\nled his streams across their meadow land, and deprived them of water for\r\nirrigation. They protested against arbitrary punishments, unknown to the\r\nold consuetudinary village law-courts (_Haingerichte_).\r\n\r\nThey formulated their demands for justice in various series of articles,\r\nall of which had common features, but contained some striking differences.\r\nSome dwelt more on the grievances of the peasants, others voiced the\r\ndemands of the working classes of the towns, others again contained traces\r\nof the political aspirations of the more educated leaders of the movement.\r\nAlmost all protest that they ask for nothing contrary to the requirements\r\nof just authority, whether civil or ecclesiastical, nor to the gospel of\r\nChrist. The peasants declared that each village community should be at\r\nliberty to choose its own pastor, and to dismiss him if he proved to be\r\nunsatisfactory; that while they were willing to pay the great tithes\r\n(_i.e._ a tenth of the produce of the crops), the lesser tithes (_i.e._ a\r\ntenth of the eggs, lambs, foals, etc.) should no longer be exacted; that\r\nthese great tithes should be reserved to pay the village priest’s stipend,\r\nand that what remained over should go to support the poor; that, since God\r\nhad made all men free, serfdom should be abolished; and that, while they\r\nwere willing to obey lawful authority, peasants ought not to be called on\r\nto submit to the arbitrary commands of their landlords. They insisted that\r\nthey had a right to fish in the streams (not in fish-ponds), to kill game\r\nand wild birds, for these were public property. They demanded that the\r\nwoodlands, meadows, and ploughlands which had once belonged to the village\r\ncommunity, but which had been appropriated by the landlords, should be\r\nrestored. They insisted that arbitrary services of every kind should be\r\nabolished, and that whatever services, beyond the old feudal dues, were\r\ndemanded, should be paid for in wages. They called for the abolition of\r\nthe usage whereby the landlord was permitted, in the name of death-duty,\r\nto seize on the most valuable chattel of the deceased tenant; and for the\r\ncreation of impartial courts of justice in the country districts. They\r\nconcluded by asking that all their demands should be tested by the word of\r\nGod, and that if any of them should be found to be opposed to its\r\nteaching, it should be rejected.(323)\r\n\r\nThe townspeople asked that all class privileges should be abolished in\r\ncivic and ecclesiastical appointments; that the administration of justice\r\nin the town’s courts should be improved; that the local taxation should be\r\nreadjusted; that all the inhabitants should be permitted to vote for the\r\nelection of the councillors; and that better provision should be made for\r\nthe care of the poor. Some of the more ambitious manifestoes contained\r\ndemands for a thorough reconstruction of the entire administration of the\r\nEmpire, on a scheme which involved the overthrow of all feudal courts of\r\njustice, and contemplated a series of imperial judicatories, rising from\r\nrevived Communal Courts to a central Imperial Court of Appeal for the\r\nwhole Empire. Some manifestoes demanded a unification of the coinage,\r\nweights, and measures throughout the Empire; a confiscation of\r\necclesiastical endowments for the purpose of lessening taxation, and for\r\nthe redemption of feudal dues; a uniform rate of taxes and customs duties;\r\nrestraint to be placed on the operations of the great capitalists; the\r\nregulation of commerce and trade by law; and the admission of\r\nrepresentatives from all classes in the community into the public\r\nadministration. In every case the Emperor was regarded as the Lord\r\nParamount. There were also declarations of the sovereignty of the people,\r\nmade in such a way as to suggest that the writings of Marsilius of Padua\r\nhad been studied by some of the leaders among the insurgents. The most\r\nfamous of all these declarations was the Twelve Articles. The document was\r\nadopted by delegates from several of the insurrectionary bands, which met\r\nat Memmingen in Upper Swabia, to unite upon a common basis of action. If\r\nnot actually drafted by Schappeler, a friend of Zwingli, the articles were\r\nprobably inspired by him. These Twelve Articles gave something like unity\r\nto the movement; although it must be remembered that documents bearing the\r\ntitle do not always agree. The main thought with the peasant was to secure\r\na fair share of the land, security of tenure, and diminution of feudal\r\nservitudes; and the idea of the artisan was to obtain full civic\r\nprivileges and an adequate representation of his class on the city\r\ncouncil.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 5. The Suppression of the Revolt.\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring the earlier months of 1525 the rising carried everything before it.\r\nMany of the smaller towns made common cause with the peasants; indeed, it\r\nwas feared that all the towns of Swabia might unite in supporting the\r\nmovement. Prominent nobles were forced to join the “Evangelical\r\nBrotherhood” which had been formally constituted at Memmingen (March 7th).\r\nPrinces, like the Cardinal Elector of Mainz and the Bishop of Würzburg,\r\nhad to come to terms with the insurgents. Germany had been denuded of\r\nsoldiers, drafted to take part in the Italian wars of Charles V. The\r\nruling powers engaged the insurgents in negotiations simply for the\r\npurpose of gaining time, as was afterwards seen. But the rising had no\r\nsolidity in it, nor did it produce, save in the Tyrol, any leader capable\r\nof effectually controlling his followers and of giving practical result to\r\ntheir efforts. The insurgents became demoralised after their first\r\nsuccesses, and the whole movement had begun to show signs of dissolution\r\nbefore the princes had recovered from their terror. Philip of Hesse aided\r\nthe Elector of Saxony (John, for Frederick had died during the\r\ninsurrection) to crush Münzer at Frankenhausen (May 15th, 1525), the town\r\nof Mühlhausen was taken, and deprived of its privileges as an imperial\r\ncity, and the revolt was crushed in North Germany.\r\n\r\nGeorge Truchsess, the general of the Swabian League, his army strengthened\r\nby mercenaries returning to Germany after the battle of Pavia, mastered\r\nthe bands in Swabia and in Franconia. The Elsass revolt was suppressed\r\nwith great ferocity by Duke Anthony of Lorraine. None of the German\r\nprinces showed any consideration or mercy to their revolting subjects save\r\nthe old Elector Frederick and Philip of Hesse. The former, on his\r\ndeath-bed, besought his brother to deal leniently with the misguided\r\npeople; Philip’s peasantry had fewer matters to complain of than had those\r\nof any other province, the Landgrave discussed their grievances with them,\r\nand made concessions which effectually prevented any revolt. Everywhere\r\nelse, save in the Tyrol, the revolt was crushed with merciless severity,\r\nand between 100,000 and 150,000 of the insurgents perished on the field or\r\nelsewhere. The insurrection maintained itself in the Tyrol, in Salzburg,\r\nand in Styria until the spring of 1526; in all other districts of Germany\r\nthe insurgents were crushed before the close of 1525. No attempt was made\r\nto cure the ills which led to the rising. The oppression of the peasantry\r\nwas intensified. The last vestiges of local self-government were\r\ndestroyed, and the unfortunate people were doomed for generations to exist\r\nin the lowest degradation. The year 1525 was one of the saddest in the\r\nannals of the German Fatherland.\r\n\r\nThe Peasants’ War had a profound, lasting, and disastrous effect on the\r\nReformation movement in Germany. It affected Luther personally, and that\r\nin a way which could not fail to react upon the cause which he\r\nconspicuously led. It checked the spread of the Reformation throughout the\r\nwhole of Germany. It threw the guidance of the movement into the hands of\r\nthe evangelical princes, and destroyed the hope that it might give birth\r\nto a reformed National German Church.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 6. Luther and the Peasants’ War.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe effect of the rising upon Luther’s own character and future conduct\r\nwas too important for us to entirely pass over his personal relations to\r\nthe peasants and their revolt. He was a peasant’s son. “My father, my\r\ngrandfather, my forebears, were all genuine peasants,” he was accustomed\r\nto say. He had seen and pitied the oppression of the peasant class, and\r\nhad denounced it in his own trenchant fashion. He had reproved the greed\r\nof the landlords, when he said that if the peasant’s land produced as many\r\ncoins as ears of corn, the profit would go to the landlord only. He had\r\npublicly expressed his approval of many of the proposals in the Twelve\r\nArticles long before they had been formulated and adopted at Memmingen in\r\nMarch 1525, and had advocated a return to the old communal laws or usages\r\nof Germany. He formally declared his agreement with the substance of the\r\nTwelve Articles after they had become the “charter” of the revolt. But\r\nLuther, rightly or wrongly, held that no real good could come from armed\r\ninsurrection. He believed with all the tenacity of his nature, that while\r\nthere might be two roads to reform, the way of peace, and the way of war,\r\nthe pathway of peace was the only one which would lead to lasting benefit.\r\nAfter the storm burst he risked his life over and over again in visits he\r\npaid to the disaffected districts, to warn the people of the dangers they\r\nwere running. After Münzer’s attempt to rouse the miners of Mansfeld, and\r\ncarry fire and sword into the district where his parents were living,\r\nLuther made one last attempt to bring the misguided people to a more\r\nreasonable course. He made a preaching tour through the disaffected\r\ndistricts. He went west from Eisleben to Stolberg (April 21st, 1525);\r\nthence to Nordhausen, where Münzer’s sympathisers rang the bells to drown\r\nhis voice; south to Erfurt (April 28th); north again to the fertile valley\r\nof the Golden Aue and to Wallhausen (May 1st); south again to Weimar (May\r\n3rd), where news reached him that his Elector was dying, and that he had\r\nexpressed the wish to see him,—a message which reached him too late. It\r\nwas on this journey, or shortly after his return to Wittenberg (May 6th),\r\nthat Luther wrote his vehement tract, _Against the murdering, thieving\r\nhordes of Peasants_. He wrote it while his mind was full of Münzer’s calls\r\nto slaughter, when the danger was at its height, with all the sights and\r\nsounds of destruction and turmoil in eye and ear, while it still hung in\r\nthe balance whether the insurgent bands might not carry all before them.\r\nIn this terrible pamphlet Luther hounded on the princes to crush the\r\nrising. It is this pamphlet, all extenuating circumstances being taken\r\ninto account, which must ever remain an ineffaceable stain on his noble\r\nlife and career.(324)\r\n\r\nAs for himself, the Peasants’ War imprinted in him a deep distrust of all\r\nwho had any connection with the rising. He had not forgotten Carlstadt’s\r\naction at Wittenberg in 1521-1522, and when Carlstadt was found attempting\r\nto preach the insurrection in Franconia and Swabia, Luther never forgave\r\nhim. His deep-rooted and unquenchable suspicion of Zwingli may be traced\r\nback to his discovery that friends of the Zurich Reformer had been at\r\nMemmingen, had aided the revolutionary delegates to draft the Twelve\r\nArticles, and had induced them to shelter themselves under the shield of a\r\nreligious Reformation. What is perhaps more important, the Peasants’ War\r\ngave to Luther a deep and abiding distrust of the “common man” which was\r\naltogether lacking in the earlier stages of his career, which made him\r\nprevent every effort to give anything like a democratic ecclesiastical\r\norganisation to the Evangelical Church, and which led him to bind his\r\nReformation in the chains of secular control to the extent of regarding\r\nthe secular authority as possessing a quasi-episcopal function.(325) It is\r\nprobably true that he saved the Reformation in Germany by cutting it loose\r\nfrom the revolutionary movement; but the wrench left marks on his own\r\ncharacter as well as on that of the movement he headed. Luther’s enemies\r\nwere quick to make capital out of his relations with the peasants, and\r\nEinser compared him to Pilate, who washed his hands after betraying Jesus\r\nto the Jews.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 7. Germany divided into two separate Camps.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe insurrection, altogether apart from its personal effects on Luther,\r\nhad a profound influence on the whole of the German Reformation. Some\r\nprinces who had hitherto favoured the Romanist side were confirmed in\r\ntheir opposition; others who had hesitated, definitely abandoned the cause\r\nof Reform. For both, it seemed that a social revolution of a desperate\r\nkind lay behind the Protestant Reformation. Many an innocent preacher of\r\nthe new faith perished in the disturbances—sought out and slain by the\r\nprinces as an instigator of the rebellion. Duke Anthony of Lorraine, for\r\nexample, in his suppression of the revolt in Elsass, made no concealment\r\nof his belief that evangelical preachers were the cause of the rising, and\r\nbutchered them without mercy when he could discover them. The Curia found\r\nthat the Peasants’ War was an admirable text to preach from when they\r\ninsisted that Luther was another Huss, and that the movement which he led\r\nwas a revival of the ecclesiastical and social communism of the extreme\r\nHussites (Taborites); that all who attacked the Church of Rome were\r\nengaged in attempting to destroy the bases of society. It was after the\r\nPeasants’ War that the Roman Catholic League of princes grew strong in\r\nnumbers and in cohesion.\r\n\r\nThe result of the war also showed that the one strong political element in\r\nGermany was the princedom. The _Reichsregiment_, which still preserved a\r\nprecarious existence, had shown that it had no power to cope with the\r\ndisturbances, and its attempts at mediation had been treated with\r\ncontempt. From this year, 1525, the political destiny of the land was\r\ndistinctly seen to be definitely shaping for territorial centralisation\r\nround the greater princes and nobles. It was inevitable that the\r\nconservative religious Reformation should follow the lines of political\r\ngrowth, with the result that there could not be a National Evangelical\r\nChurch of Germany. It could only find outcome in territorial Churches\r\nunder the rule and protection of those princes who from motives of\r\nreligion and conscience had adopted the principles which Luther preached.\r\n\r\nThe more radical religious movement broke up into fragments, and\r\nreappeared in the guise of the maligned and persecuted Anabaptists,—a name\r\nwhich embraced a very wide variety of religious opinions,—some of whom\r\nappropriated to themselves the aspirations of the social revolution which\r\nhad been crushed by the princes. The conservative and Lutheran Reformation\r\nfound its main elements of strength in the middle classes of Germany;\r\nwhile the Anabaptists had their largest following among the artisans and\r\nworking men of the towns.\r\n\r\nThe terrors of the time separated Germany into two hostile camps—the one\r\naccepting and the other rejecting the ecclesiastical Reformation, which\r\nceased to be a national movement in any real sense of the word.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter V. From The Diet Of Speyer, 1526, To The Religious Peace Of\r\nAugsburg, 1555.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 1. The Diet of Speyer, 1526.(326)\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen Germany emerged from the social revolution in the end of 1525, it\r\nsoon became apparent that the religious question remained unsettled, and\r\nwas dividing the country into two parties whose differences had become\r\nvisibly accentuated, and that both held as strongly as ever to their\r\ndistinctive principles. Perhaps one of the reasons for the increased\r\nstrain was the conduct of many of the Romanist princes in suppressing the\r\nrebellion. The victories of the Swabian League in South Germany were\r\neverywhere followed by religious persecution. Men were condemned to\r\nconfiscation of goods or to death, not for rebellion, for they had never\r\ntaken part in the rising, but for their confessed attachment to Lutheran\r\nteaching. The Lutheran preachers were special objects of attack. Aichili,\r\nwho acted as a provost-marshal to the Swabian League, made himself\r\nconspicuous by plundering, mulcting, and putting them to death. It is said\r\nthat he hung forty Lutheran pastors on the trees by the roadside in one\r\nsmall district. The Roman Catholic princes had banded themselves together\r\nfor mutual defence as early as July 1525. The more influential members of\r\nthis league were Duke George of Saxony, the Electors of Brandenburg and\r\nMainz, and Duke Henry of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel. Duke Henry was selected\r\nto inform the Emperor of what they had done, and to secure his sympathy\r\nand support. He told Charles V. that the league had been formed “against\r\nthe Lutherans in case they should attempt by force or cunning to gain them\r\nover to their unbelief.”\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the Protestant princes had a mutual understanding—it\r\ndoes not seem to have been a definite league—to defend one another against\r\nany attack upon their faith. The leaders were John of Saxony, Philip of\r\nHesse, Dukes Otto, Ernest, and Francis of Brunswick-Lüneberg, and the\r\nCounts of Mansfeld. Philip of Hesse was the soul of the union. They could\r\ncount on the support of many of the imperial cities, some of them, such as\r\nNürnberg, being in districts where the country lying around was ruled by\r\nRomanist princes.\r\n\r\nThe Diet, which met at Augsburg in 1525, was very thinly attended, and\r\nboth parties waited for the Diet which was to be held at Speyer in the\r\nfollowing year.\r\n\r\nThere never had been any doubt about the position and opinions of the\r\nEmperor on the religious question. He had stated them emphatically at the\r\nDiet of Worms. He had been educated in the beliefs of mediæval\r\nCatholicism: he valued the ceremonies and usages of the mediæval worship;\r\nhe understood no other ecclesiastical polity; he believed that the Bishop\r\nof Rome was the head of the Church on earth; he had consistently\r\npersecuted Protestants in his hereditary dominions from the beginning; he\r\ndesired the execution of the Edict of Worms against Luther. If he had\r\nremained in Germany, all his personal and official influence would have\r\nbeen thrown into the scale against the evangelical faith. Troubles in\r\nSpain, and the prosecution of the war against Francis of France had\r\nprevented his presence in Germany after his first brief visit. He had now\r\nconquered and taken Francis prisoner at the battle of Pavia. The terms of\r\nthe Treaty of Madrid bound Francis to assist Charles in suppressing\r\nLutheranism and other pernicious sects in Germany, and when it was signed\r\nthe Emperor seemed free to crush the German Protestants. But his very\r\nsuccess was against him; papal diplomacy wove another web around him; he\r\nwas still unable to visit the Fatherland, and the religious question had\r\nto be discussed at Speyer in his absence.\r\n\r\nWhen the Diet met, the national hostility to Rome showed no signs of\r\nabatement. The subject of German grievances against the Curia was again\r\nrevived, and it was alleged that the chief causes of the Peasants’ War\r\nwere the merciless exactions of clerical landholders. Perhaps this opinion\r\nwas justified by the fact that the condition of the peasantry on the lands\r\nof monasteries and of bishops was notoriously worse than that of those\r\nunder secular proprietors; and that, while the clerical landholders had\r\ndone little to subdue the rebels, they had been merciless after the\r\ninsurgents had been subdued. There was truth enough in the charge to make\r\nit a sufficient answer to the accusation that the social revolution had\r\nbeen the outcome of Luther’s teaching.\r\n\r\nFerdinand of Austria presided in his brother’s absence, and, acting on the\r\nEmperor’s instructions, he demanded the enforcement of the Edict of Worms\r\nand a decree of the Diet to forbid all innovations in worship and in\r\ndoctrine. He promised that if these imperial demands were granted, the\r\nEmperor would induce the Pope to call a General Council for the definite\r\nsettlement of the religious difficulties. But the Diet was not inclined to\r\nadopt the suggestions. The Emperor was at war with the Pope. Many of the\r\nclerical members felt themselves to be in a delicate position, and did not\r\nattend. The Lutheran sympathisers were in a majority, and the delegates\r\nfrom the cities insisted that it was impossible to enforce the Edict of\r\nWorms. The Committee of Princes(327) proposed to settle the religious\r\nquestion by a compromise which was almost wholly favourable to the\r\nReformation. They suggested that the marriage of priests, giving the cup\r\nto the laity, the use of German as well as Latin in the baptismal and\r\ncommunion services, should be recognised; that all private Masses should\r\nbe abolished; that the number of ecclesiastical holy days should be\r\nlargely reduced; and that in the exposition of Holy Writ the rule ought to\r\nbe that scripture should be interpreted by scripture. After a good deal of\r\nfencing, the Diet finally resolved on a deliverance which provided that\r\nthe word of God should be preached without disturbance, that indemnity\r\nshould be granted for past offences against the Edict of Worms, and that,\r\nuntil the meeting of a General Council to be held in a German city, each\r\nState should so live as it hoped to answer for its conduct to God and to\r\nthe Emperor.\r\n\r\nThe decision was a triumph for the territorial system as well as for the\r\nReformation, and foreshadowed the permanent religious peace of Augsburg\r\n(1555). It is difficult to see how either Charles or Ferdinand could have\r\naccepted it. Their acquiescence was probably due to the fact that the\r\nEmperor was then at war with the Pope (the sack of Rome under the\r\nConstable Bourbon took place on May 6th, 1527), and that the threat of a\r\nGerman ecclesiastical revolt was a good weapon to use against His\r\nHoliness. Ferdinand was negotiating for election to the crowns of Hungary\r\nand Bohemia, and dared not offend his German subjects. Both brothers\r\nlooked on any concessions to the German Lutherans as temporary compromises\r\nto be withdrawn as soon as they were able to enforce their own views.\r\n\r\nThe Protestant States and cities at once interpreted this decision of the\r\nDiet to mean that they had the legal right to organise territorial\r\nChurches and to introduce such changes into public worship as would bring\r\nit into harmony with their evangelical beliefs.(328) The latent\r\nevangelical feeling at once manifested itself. Almost all North Germany,\r\nexcept Brandenburg, Ducal Saxony, and Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel, became\r\nLutheran within three years. Still it has to be noticed that the legal\r\nrecognition was accorded to the secular authorities, and that a ruling\r\nprince, who had no very settled religious convictions, might change the\r\nreligion of his principality from political or selfish motives. It became\r\nevident in 1529 that political feeling or fear of the Emperor was much\r\nstronger than resolutions to support the evangelical Reformation.\r\n\r\nSoon after the Diet, Philip of Hesse committed a political blunder which,\r\nin the opinion of many of his evangelical friends, involved disloyalty to\r\nthe Fatherland, made them chary of associating themselves with him, and\r\ngreatly weakened the Protestant party. For most of these North German\r\nprinces, in spite of their clinging to the disruptive territorial\r\nprinciple, had a rugged conscientious patriotism which made them feel that\r\nno good German should seek the aid of France or make alliance with a\r\nCzech. Many of the Roman Catholic princes, irritated at the spread and\r\norganisation of Lutheranism which followed the decision of the Diet of\r\n1526, had been persecuting by confiscation of goods and by death their\r\nLutheran subjects. The Landgrave had married the daughter of Duke George\r\nof Saxony, and he knew that his father-in-law was continually uttering\r\nthreats against the Elector of Saxony. Brooding over these things, Philip\r\nbecame gradually convinced that the Romanist princes were planning a\r\ndeadly assault on the Lutherans, and that first the Elector and then he\r\nhimself would be attacked and their territories partitioned among the\r\nconquerors. He had no proof, but his suspicions were strong. Chance\r\nbrought him in contact with Otto von Pack, the steward of the Chancery of\r\nDucal Saxony, who, on being questioned, admitted that the suspicions of\r\nPhilip were correct, and promised to procure a copy of the treaty. Pack\r\nwas a scoundrel. No such treaty existed. He forged a document which he\r\ndeclared to be a copy of a genuine treaty, and got 4000 gulden for his\r\npains. Philip took the forgery to the Elector of Saxony and to Luther,\r\nboth of whom had no doubt of its genuine character. They both, however,\r\nrefused to agree to Philip’s plan of seeking assistance outside the\r\nEmpire. The Landgrave believed the situation too dangerous to be faced\r\npassively. He tried to secure the assistance of Francis of France and of\r\nZapolya, the determined opponent of the House of Austria in Bohemia. It\r\nwas not until he had fully committed himself that the discovery was made\r\nthat the document he had trusted in was nothing but a forgery. His hasty\r\naction in appealing to France and Bohemia to interfere in the domestic\r\nconcerns of the Empire was resented by his co-religionists. When the Diet\r\nmet at Speyer, the Lutherans were divided and discredited. On the other\r\nhand, the Pope and the Emperor were no longer at war, and the clerical\r\nmembers flocked to the Diet in large numbers.\r\n\r\nAt this memorable Diet of Speyer (1529), a compact Roman Catholic majority\r\nfaced a weak Lutheran minority. The Emperor, through his commissioners,\r\ndeclared at the outset that he abolished, “by his imperial and absolute\r\nauthority (_Machtvollkommenheit_),” the clause in the ordinance of 1526 on\r\nwhich the Lutherans had relied when they founded their territorial\r\nChurches; it had been the cause, he said, “of much ill counsel and\r\nmisunderstanding.” The majority of the Diet upheld the Emperor’s decision,\r\nand the practical effect of the ordinance which was voted was to rescind\r\nthat of 1526. It declared that the German States which had accepted the\r\nEdict of Worms should continue to do so; which meant that there was to be\r\nno toleration for Lutherans in Romanist districts. It said that in\r\ndistricts which had departed from the Edict no further innovations were to\r\nbe made, save that no one was to be prevented from hearing Mass; that\r\nsects which denied the sacrament of the true Body and Blood of Christ\r\n(Zwinglians) should no more be tolerated than Anabaptists. What was most\r\nimportant, it declared that no ecclesiastical body should be deprived of\r\nits authority or revenues. It was this last clause which destroyed all\r\npossibility of creating Lutheran Churches; for it meant that the mediæval\r\necclesiastical rule was everywhere to be restored, and with it the right\r\nof bishops to deal with all preachers within their dioceses.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 2. The Protest.(329)\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was this ordinance which called forth the celebrated PROTEST, from\r\nwhich comes the name _Protestant_. The Protest was read in the Diet on the\r\nday (April 19th, 1529) when all concessions to the Lutherans had been\r\nrefused. Ferdinand and the other imperial commissioners would not permit\r\nits publication in the “recess,” and the protesters had a legal instrument\r\ndrafted and published, in which they embodied the Protest, with all the\r\nnecessary documents annexed. The legal position taken was that the\r\nunanimous decision of one Diet (1526) could not be rescinded by a majority\r\nin a second Diet (1529). The Protesters declared that they meant to abide\r\nby the “recess” of 1526; that the “recess” of 1529 was not to be held\r\nbinding on them, because they were not consenting parties. When forced to\r\nmake their choice between obedience to God and obedience to the Emperor,\r\nthey were compelled to choose the former; and they appealed, from the\r\nwrongs done to them at the Diet, to the Emperor, to the next free General\r\nCouncil of Holy Christendom, or to an ecclesiastical congress of the\r\nGerman nation. The document was signed by the Elector John of Saxony,\r\nMargrave George of Brandenburg, Dukes Ernest and Francis of\r\nBrunswick-Lüneburg, Landgrave Philip of Hesse, and Prince Wolfgang of\r\nAnhalt. The fourteen cities which adhered were Strassburg, Nürnberg, Ulm,\r\nConstance, Lindau, Memmingen, Kempten, Nördlingen, Heilbronn, Reutlingen,\r\nIsny, St. Gallen, Wissenberg, and Windsheim. Many of these cities were\r\nZwinglian rather than Lutheran; but all united in face of the common\r\ndanger.\r\n\r\nThe Protest at Speyer embodied the principle, not a new one, that a\r\nminority of German States, when they felt themselves oppressed by a\r\nmajority, could entrench themselves behind the laws of the Empire; and the\r\nidea is seen at work onward to the Diet of 1555, when it was definitely\r\nrecognised. Such a minority, to maintain a successful defence, had to be\r\nunited and able to protect itself by force if necessary. This was at once\r\nfelt; and three days after the Protest had been read in the Diet (April,\r\n22nd), Electoral Saxony, Hesse, and the cities of Strassburg, Ulm, and\r\nNürnberg had concluded a “secret and particular treaty.” They pledged\r\nthemselves to mutual defence if attacked on account of God’s word, whether\r\nthe onslaught came from the Swabian League, from the _Reichsregiment_, or\r\nfrom the Emperor himself. Soon after the Diet, proposals were brought\r\nforward to make the compact effective and extensive,—one drafted by\r\nrepresentatives of the cities and the other by the Elector of\r\nSaxony,—which provided very thoroughly for mutual support; but neither\r\ntook into account the differences which lay behind the Protest. These\r\ndivergences were strong enough to wreck the union.\r\n\r\nThe differences which separated the German Protestants were not wholly\r\ntheological, although their doctrinal disputes were most in evidence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 3. Luther and Zwingli.\r\n\r\n\r\nA movement for reformation, which owed little or nothing to Wittenberg,\r\nhad been making rapid progress in Switzerland, and two of the strongest\r\ncantons, Zurich and Bern, had revolted from the Roman Church. Its leader,\r\nHuldreich Zwingli, was utterly unlike Luther in temperament, training, and\r\nenvironment.\r\n\r\nHe had never gone through the terrible spiritual conflicts which had\r\nmarked Luther for life, and had made him the man that he was. No deep\r\nsense of personal sin had ever haunted him, to make his early manhood a\r\nburden to him. Long after he had become known as a Reformer, he was able\r\nto combine a strong sense of moral responsibility with some laxity in\r\nprivate life. Unlike both Luther and Calvin, he was not the type of man to\r\nbe leader in a deeply spiritual revival.\r\n\r\nHe had been subjected to the influences of Humanism from his childhood.\r\nHis uncle, Bartholomew Zwingli, parish priest at Wildhaus, and the dean of\r\nWesen, under whose charge the boy was placed, had a strong sympathy for\r\nthe New Learning, and the boy imbibed it. His young intellect was fed on\r\nHomer and Pindar and Cicero; and all his life he esteemed the great pagans\r\nof antiquity as highly as he did any Christian saint. If it can be said\r\nthat he bent before the dominating influence of any one man, it was\r\nErasmus and not Luther who compelled him to admiration. He had for a\r\nteacher Thomas Wyttenbach, who was half Reformer and half disciple of\r\nErasmus; and learned from him to study the Scriptures and the writings of\r\nsuch earlier Church Fathers as Origen, Jerome, and Chrysostom. Like many\r\nanother Humanist north of the Alps, the mystical Christian Platonism of\r\nPico della Mirandola had some influence on him. He had never studied the\r\nScholastic Theology, and knew nothing of the spell it cast over men who\r\nhad been trained in it. Of all the Reformers, Luther was the least removed\r\nfrom the mediæval way of looking at religion, and Zwingli had wandered\r\nfarthest from it.\r\n\r\nHis earliest ecclesiastical surroundings were also different from\r\nLuther’s. He had never been taught in childhood to consider the Church to\r\nbe the Pope’s House, in which the Bishop of Rome was entitled to the\r\nreverence and obedience due to the house-father. In his land the people\r\nhad been long accustomed to manage their own ecclesiastical affairs. The\r\ngreater portion of Switzerland had known but little either of the benefits\r\nor disadvantages of mediæval episcopal rule. Church property paid its\r\nshare of the communal taxes, and even the monasteries and convents were\r\nliable to civil inspection. If a stray tourist at the present day wanders\r\ninto the church which is called the Cathedral in that survival of ancient\r\nmediæval republics, San Marino, he will find that the seats of the\r\n“consuls” of the little republic occupy the place where he expects to find\r\nthe bishop’s chair. The civil power asserted its supremacy over the\r\necclesiastical in most things in these small mediæval republics. The Popes\r\nneeded San Marino to be a thorn in the side of the Malatesta of Rimini,\r\nthey hired most of their soldiers from the Swiss cantons, and therefore\r\ntolerated many things which they would not have permitted elsewhere.\r\n\r\nThe social environment of the Swiss Reformer was very different from that\r\nof Luther. He was a free Swiss who had listened in childhood to tales of\r\nthe heroic fights of Morgarten, Sempach, Morat, and Nancy, and had imbibed\r\nthe hereditary hatred of the House of Hapsburg. He had no fear of the\r\n“common man,” Luther’s bugbear after the Peasants’ War. Orderly democratic\r\nlife was the air he breathed, and what reverence Luther had for the\r\nEmperor “who protected poor people against the Turk,” and for the lords of\r\nthe soil, Zwingli paid to the civic fathers elected by a popular vote.\r\nWhen the German Reformer thought of Zwingli he was always muttering what\r\nArchbishop Parker said of John Knox—“God keep us from such visitations as\r\nKnockes hath attempted in Scotland; the people to be orderers of\r\nthings!”(330)\r\n\r\nOwing doubtless to this republican training, Zwingli had none of that\r\naloofness from political affairs which was a marked characteristic of\r\nLuther. He believed that his mission had as much to do with politics as\r\nwith religion, and that religious reformation was to be worked out by\r\npolitical forces, whether in the more limited sphere of Switzerland or in\r\nlarger Germany. He had never taken a step forward until he had carried\r\nalong with him the civic authorities of Zurich. His advance had always\r\nbeen calculated. Luther’s _Theses_ (November 1517) had been the volcanic\r\noutburst of a conscience troubled by the sight of a great religious\r\nscandal, and their author had no intention of doing more than protesting\r\nagainst the one great evil; he had no idea at the time where his protest\r\nwas leading him. Zwingli’s _Theses_ (January 1523) were the carefully\r\ndrafted programme of a Reformation which he meant to accomplish by\r\ndegrees, and through the assistance of the Council of Zurich. His mind was\r\nfull of political combinations for the purpose of carrying out his plans\r\nof reformation. As early as 1524 he was in correspondence with Pirkheimer\r\nabout the possibility of a league between Nürnberg and Zurich—two powerful\r\nProtestant towns. This league did not take shape. But in 1527 a religious\r\nand political league (_das christliche Bürgerrecht_) was concluded between\r\nZurich and Constance, an imperial German town; St. Gallen joined in 1528;\r\nBiel, Mühlhausen, and Basel in 1529; even Strassburg, afraid of the\r\ngrowing power of the House of Hapsburg, was included in 1530. The feverish\r\npolitical activity of Zwingli commended him to Philip of Hesse almost as\r\nstrongly as it made him disliked, and even feared, by Ferdinand of\r\nAustria. The Elector of Saxony and Luther dreaded his influence over “the\r\nyoung man of Hesse.”\r\n\r\nMelanchthon was the first to insist on the evil influences of Zwingli’s\r\nactivity for the peace of the Empire. He persuaded himself that had the\r\nLutherans stood alone at Speyer, the Romanists would have been prepared to\r\nmake concessions which would have made the Protest needless. He returned\r\nto Wittenberg full of misgivings. The Protest might lead to a defiance of\r\nthe Emperor, and to a subversion of the Empire. Was it right for subjects\r\nto defend themselves by war against the civil power which was ordained of\r\nGod? “My conscience,” he wrote, “is disquieted because of this thing; I am\r\nhalf dead with thinking about it.”\r\n\r\nHe found Luther only too sympathetic; resolute to maintain that if the\r\nprince commanded anything which was contrary to the word of God, it was\r\nthe duty of the subject to offer what passive resistance he was able, but\r\nthat it was never right to oppose him actively by force of arms. Still\r\nless was it the duty of a Christian man to ally himself for such\r\nresistance with those who did not hold “the whole truth of God.” Luther\r\nwould therefore have nothing to do with an alliance offensive and\r\ndefensive against the Emperor with cities who shared in what he believed\r\nto be the errors of Zwingli.\r\n\r\nThis meant a great deal more than a break with the Swiss. The south German\r\ntowns of Strassburg, Memmingen, Constance, Lindau, and others were more\r\nZwinglian than Lutheran. It was not only that they were inclined to the\r\nmore radical theology of the Swiss Reformer; they found that his method of\r\norganising a reformed Church, drafted for the needs of Zurich, suited\r\ntheir municipal institutions better than the territorial organisations\r\nbeing adopted by the Lutheran Churches of North Germany. To Luther, whose\r\nviews of the place of the “common man” in the Church had been changed by\r\nthe Peasants’ War, this was of itself a danger which threatened the\r\nwelfare of the infant Churches. It made ecclesiastical government too\r\ndemocratic; and it did this in the very centres where the democracy was\r\nmost dangerous. He could not forget that the mob of these German towns had\r\ntaken part in the recently suppressed social revolution, that their\r\nworking-class population was still the recruiting ground of the Anabaptist\r\nsectaries, and that at Memmingen itself Zwinglian partisans had helped to\r\norganise the revolution, and to link it on to the religious awakening.\r\nBesides, the attraction which drew these German cities to the Swiss might\r\nlead to larger political consequences which seemed to threaten what unity\r\nremained to the German Empire. It might result in the detachment of towns\r\nfrom the German Fatherland, and in the formation of new cantons cut adrift\r\nfrom Germany to increase the strength of the Swiss Confederation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 4. The Marburg Colloquy.(331)\r\n\r\n\r\nAll these thoughts were in the minds of Luther and of his fellow\r\ntheologians, and had their weight with the Elector of Saxony, when their\r\nrefusal to join rendered the proposed defensive league impossible. No one\r\nwas more disappointed than the Landgrave of Hesse, the ablest political\r\nleader whom the German Reformation produced. He knew more about Zwingli\r\nthan his fellow princes in North Germany; he had a keen interest in\r\ntheological questions; he sympathised to some extent with the special\r\nopinions of Zwingli; and he had not the dread of democracy which possessed\r\nLuther and his Elector. He believed, rightly as events showed, that\r\ndifferences or suspected differences in theology were the strongest causes\r\nof separation; he was correct in supposing that the Lutheran divines\r\nthrough ignorance magnified those points of difference; and he hoped that\r\nif the Lutherans and the Swiss could be brought together, they would learn\r\nto know each other better. So he tried to arrange for a religious\r\nconference in his castle at Marburg. He had many a difficulty to overcome\r\nso far as the Lutherans were concerned. Neither Luther nor Melanchthon\r\ndesired to meet Zwingli. Melanchthon thought that if a conference was to\r\nbe held, it would be much better to meet Oecolampadius and perhaps some\r\nlearned Romanists. Zwingli, on the other hand, was eager to meet Luther.\r\nHe responded at once. He came, without waiting for leave to be given by\r\nthe Zurich Council, across a country full of enemies. The conference met\r\nfrom October 30th to November 5th, 1529. Luther was accompanied by\r\nMelanchthon, Justus Jonas, and Cruciger, Frederick Mecum from Gotha,\r\nOsiander from Nürnberg, Brenz from Hall, Stephan Agricola from Augsburg,\r\nand others. With Zwingli came Oecolampadius, Bucer, and Hedio from\r\nStrassburg, Rudolph Collin (who has left the fullest account of the\r\ndiscussion), two councillors from Basel and from Zurich, and Jacob Sturm\r\nfrom Strassburg. After a preliminary conference between Zwingli and\r\nMelanchthon on the one hand, and Luther and Oecolampadius on the other,\r\nthe real discussion took place in the great hall of the Castle. The\r\ntourist is still shown the exact spot where the table which separated the\r\ndisputants was placed.\r\n\r\nThis _Marburg Colloquy_, as the conference was called, had important\r\nresults for good, although it was unsuccessful in fulfilling the\r\nexpectations of the Landgrave. It showed a real and substantial harmony\r\nbetween the two sets of theologians on all points save one. Fifteen\r\ntheological articles (_The Marburg Articles_) stated the chief heads of\r\nthe Christian faith, and fourteen were signed by Luther and by Zwingli.\r\nThe one subject on which they could not come to an agreement was the\r\nrelation of the Body of Christ to the elements Bread and Wine in the\r\nSacrament of the Supper. It was scarcely to be expected that there could\r\nbe harmony on a doctrinal matter on which there had been such a long and\r\nembittered controversy.\r\n\r\nBoth theologians found in the mediæval doctrine of the Sacrament of the\r\nSupper what they believed to be an overwhelming error destructive to the\r\nspiritual life. It presupposed that a priest, in virtue of mysterious\r\npowers conferred in ordination, could give or withhold from the Christian\r\npeople the benefits conveyed in the Sacrament. It asserted that the priest\r\ncould change the elements Bread and Wine into the very Body and Blood of\r\nChrist, and that unless this change was made there was no presence of\r\nChrist in the sacrament, and no possibility of sacramental grace for the\r\ncommunicant. Luther attacked the problem as a mediæval Christian, content,\r\nif he was able to purge the ordinance of this one fault, to leave all else\r\nas he found it. Zwingli came as a Humanist, whose fundamental rule was to\r\nget beyond the mediæval theology altogether, and attempt to discover how\r\nthe earlier Church Fathers could aid him to solve the problem. This\r\ndifference in mental attitude led them to approach the subject from\r\nseparate sides; and the mediæval way of looking at the whole subject\r\nrendered difference of approach very easy. The mediæval Church had divided\r\nthe Sacrament of the Lord’s Supper into two distinct parts—the Mass and\r\nthe Eucharist.(332) The Mass was inseparably connected with the thought of\r\nthe great Sacrifice of Christ upon the Cross, and the Eucharist with the\r\nthought of the believer’s communion with the Risen Living Christ. Zwingli\r\nattacked the Romanist doctrine of the Mass, and Luther sought to give an\r\nevangelical meaning to the mediæval conception of the Eucharist. Hence the\r\ntwo Protestant antagonists were never exactly facing each other.\r\n\r\nLuther’s convent studies in D’Ailly, Biel, and their common master,\r\nWilliam of Occam, enabled him to show that there might be the presence of\r\nthe Glorified Body of Christ, extended in space, in the elements Bread and\r\nWine in a natural way, and without any priestly miracle: and that\r\nsatisfied him; it enabled him to deny the priestly miracle and keep true\r\nin the most literal way to the words of the institution, “This is My\r\nBody.”\r\n\r\nZwingli, on the other hand, insisted that the primary reference in the\r\nLord’s Supper was to the death of Christ, and that it was above all things\r\na commemorative rite. He transformed the mediæval Mass into an evangelical\r\nsacrament, by placing the idea of commemoration where the mediæval\r\ntheologian had put that of repetition, and held that the means of\r\nappropriation was faith and not eating with the mouth. This he held to be\r\na return to the belief of the early centuries, before the conception of\r\nthe sacrament had been corrupted by pagan ideas.\r\n\r\nLike Luther, he served himself heir to the work of earlier theologians;\r\nbut he did not go to Occam, Biel, or D’Ailly, as the German Reformer had\r\ndone. Erasmus, who had no liking for the priestly miracle in the Mass, and\r\ncared little for a rigid literal interpretation of the words of the\r\ninstitution, had declared that the Sacrament of the Supper was the symbol\r\nof commemoration, of a covenant with God, and of the fellowship of all\r\nbelievers in Christ, and this commended itself to Zwingli’s conception of\r\nthe social character of Christianity; but he was too much a Christian\r\ntheologian to be contented with such a vague idea of the rite. Many\r\ntheologians of the later Middle Ages, when speculation was more free than\r\nit could be after the stricter definitions of the Council of Trent, had\r\ntried to purify and spiritualise the beliefs of the Church about the\r\nmeaning of the central Christian rite. Foremost among them was John Wessel\r\n(_c._ 1420-1489), with his long and elaborate treatise, _De Sacramento\r\nEucharistiæ_. He had taught that the Lord’s Supper is the rite in which\r\nthe death of Christ is presented to and appropriated by the believer; that\r\nit is above all things a commemoration of that death and a communion or\r\nparticipation in the benefits which followed; that communion with the\r\nspiritual presence of Jesus is of far more importance than any corporeal\r\ncontact with the Body of Christ; and that this communion is shared in\r\nthrough faith. These thoughts had been taken over by Christopher Honius, a\r\ndivine of the Netherlands, who had enforced them by insisting that our\r\nLord’s discourse in the 6th chapter of St. John’s Gospel had reproved any\r\nmaterialistic conception of the Lord’s Supper; and that _therefore_ the\r\nwords of the institution must not be taken in their rigid literal meaning.\r\nHe had been the first to suggest that the word _is_ in “This is My Body”\r\nmust mean _signifies_. Wessel and Honius were the predecessors of Zwingli,\r\nand he wove their thoughts into his doctrine of the Lord’s Supper. It\r\nshould be remembered that Luther had also been acquainted with the labours\r\nof Wessel and of Honius, and that so far from attracting they had repelled\r\nhim, simply because he thought they failed to give the respect due to the\r\nliteral meaning of the words of the institution.\r\n\r\nIt must not be forgotten that Luther knew Zwingli only as in some way\r\nconnected with Andrew Bodenstein of Carlstadt. Carlstadt had professed to\r\naccept the theory of Honius about the nature of the relation of the\r\nPresence of Christ to the elements of Bread and Wine—saying that the\r\nlatter were _signs_, and nothing more, of the former. A controversy soon\r\nraged in Wittenberg to the scandal of German Protestantism. Luther\r\ninsisted more and more on the necessity of the Presence in the elements of\r\nthe Body of Christ “corporeally extended in space”; while Carlstadt denied\r\nthat Presence in any sense whatsoever. Luther insisted with all the\r\nstrength of language at his command that the literal sense of the words of\r\nthe institution must be preserved, and that the words “This is My Body”\r\nmust refer to the Bread and to the Wine; while Carlstadt thought it was\r\nmore likely that while using the words our Lord pointed to His own Body,\r\nor if not, that religious conviction compelled another interpretation than\r\nthe one on which Luther insisted.\r\n\r\nThe dust of all this controversy was in the eyes of the theologians when\r\nthey met at Marburg, and prevented them carefully examining each other’s\r\ndoctrinal position. In all essential matters Luther and Zwingli were not\r\nso far apart as each supposed the other to be. Their respective theories,\r\nput very shortly, may be thus summed up.\r\n\r\nZwingli, looking mainly at the mediæval doctrine of the Mass, taught: (1)\r\nThe Lord’s Supper is not a _repetition_ of the sacrifice of Christ on the\r\nCross, but a _commemoration_ of that sacrifice once offered up; and the\r\nelements are not a newly offered Christ, but the _signs_ of the Body and\r\nBlood of the Christ who was once for all offered on Calvary. (2) That\r\nforgiveness for sin is not won by _partaking_ in a newly offered Christ,\r\nbut by _believing_ in a Christ once offered up. (3) That the benefits of\r\nthe work of Christ are always appropriated by faith, and that the\r\natonement is so appropriated in the sacrament, whereby Christ becomes our\r\nfood; but the food, being neither carnal nor corporeal, is not\r\nappropriated by the mouth, but by faith indwelling in the soul. Therefore\r\nthere is a Real Presence of Christ in the sacrament, but it is a spiritual\r\nPresence, not a corporeal one. A real and living faith always involves the\r\nunion of the believer with Christ, and therefore the Real Presence of\r\nChrist; and the Presence of Christ, which is in every act of faith, is in\r\nthe sacrament to the faithful partaker. (4) That while the Lord’s Supper\r\nprimarily refers to the sacrifice of Christ, and while the elements, Bread\r\nand Wine, are the symbols of the crucified Body of Christ, the partaking\r\nof the elements is also a symbol and pledge of an ever-renewed living\r\nunion with the Risen Christ. (5) That as our Lord Himself has specially\r\nwarned His followers against thinking of feeding on Him in any corporeal\r\nor carnal manner (John vi.), the words of the institution cannot be taken\r\nin a strictly literal fashion, and the phrase “This is My Body” means\r\n“This signifies My Body.” The fourth position had been rather implicitly\r\nheld than explicitly stated.\r\n\r\nLuther, looking mainly at the mediæval doctrine of the Eucharist, taught:\r\n(1) That the primary use of the sacrament was to bring believing\r\ncommunicants into direct touch with the Living Risen Christ. (2) That to\r\nthis end there must be in the Bread and Wine the local Presence of the\r\nGlorified Body of Christ, which he always conceived as “body extended in\r\nspace”; the communicants, coming into touch with this Body of Christ, have\r\ncommunion with Him, such as His disciples had on earth and as His saints\r\nnow have in heaven. (3) That this local Presence of Christ does not\r\npresuppose any special priestly miracle, for, in virtue of its _ubiquity_,\r\nthe Glorified Body of Christ is _everywhere_ naturally, and therefore is\r\nin the Bread and in the Wine: this natural Presence becomes a sacramental\r\nPresence because of the promise of God attached to the reverent and\r\nbelieving partaking of the sacrament. (4) That communion with the Living\r\nRisen Christ implies the appropriation of the Death of Christ, and of the\r\nAtonement won by this death; but this last thought of Luther’s, which is\r\nZwingli’s first thought, lies implicitly in his teaching without being\r\ndwelt upon.\r\n\r\nThe two theories, so far as doctrinal teaching goes, are supplementary to\r\neach other rather than antagonists. Each has a weak point. Luther’s\r\ndepends on a questionable mediæval idea of _ubiquity_, and Zwingli’s on a\r\nsomewhat shallow exegesis. It was unfortunate, but only natural, that when\r\nthe two theological leaders were brought together at Marburg, instead of\r\nseeking the mutual points of agreement, each should attack the weak point\r\nin the other’s theory. Luther began by chalking the words _Hoc est Corpus\r\nMeum_ on the table before him, and by saying, “I take these words\r\nliterally; if anyone does not, I shall not argue but contradict”; and\r\nZwingli spent all his argumentative powers in disputing the doctrine of\r\n_ubiquity_. The long debate went circling round these two points and could\r\nnever be got away from them. Zwingli maintained that the Body of Christ\r\nwas at the Right Hand of God, and could not be present, extended in space,\r\nin the elements, which were signs representing what was absent. Luther\r\nargued that the Body of Christ was in the elements, as, to use his own\r\nillustration, the sword is present in the sheath. As a soldier could\r\npresent his sheathed sword and say, truly and literally, _This is my\r\nsword_, although nothing but the sheath was visible; so, although nothing\r\ncould be seen or felt but Bread and Wine, these elements in the Holy\r\nSupper could be literally and truly called the Body and Blood of Christ.\r\n\r\nThe substantial harmony revealed in the fourteen articles which they all\r\ncould sign showed that the Germans and the Swiss had one faith. But Luther\r\ninsisted that their difference on the Sacrament of the Supper prevented\r\nthem becoming one visible brotherhood, and the immediate purpose of the\r\nLandgrave of Hesse was not fulfilled.\r\n\r\nUndaunted by his defeat, Philip next attempted a less comprehensive union.\r\nIf Luther and Zwingli could not be included within the one brotherhood,\r\nmight not the German cities of the south and the Lutheran princes be\r\nbrought together? Another conference was arranged at Schwabach (October\r\n1529), when a series of theological articles were to be presented for\r\nagreement. Luther prepared seventeen articles to be set before the\r\nconference. They were based on the Marburg Articles; but as Luther had\r\nstated his own doctrine of the Holy Supper in its most uncompromising\r\nform, it is not to be wondered at that the delegates from the southern\r\ncities hesitated to sign. They said that the confession (for the articles\r\ntook that form) was not in conformity with the doctrines preached among\r\nthem, and that they would need to consult their fellow-citizens before\r\ncommitting them to it. Thus Philip’s attempts to unite the Protestants of\r\nGermany failed a second time, and a divided Protestantism awaited the\r\ncoming of the Emperor, who had resolved to solve the religious difficulty\r\nin person.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 5. The Emperor in Germany.\r\n\r\n\r\nCharles V. was at the zenith of his power. The sickly looking youth of\r\nWorms had become a grave man of thirty, whose nine years of unbroken\r\nsuccess had made him the most commanding figure in Europe. He had quelled\r\nthe turbulent Spaniards; he had crushed his brilliant rival of France at\r\nthe battle of Pavia; he had humbled the Pope, and had taught His Holiness\r\nin the Sack of Rome the danger of defying the Head of the Holy Roman\r\nEmpire; and he had compelled the reluctant Pontiff to invest him with the\r\nimperial crown. He had added to and consolidated the family possessions of\r\nthe House of Hapsburg, and but lately his brother Ferdinand had won, in\r\nname at least, the crowns of Bohemia and Hungary. He was now determined to\r\nvisit Germany, and by his personal presence and influence to end the\r\nreligious difficulty which was distracting that portion of his vast\r\ndominions. He also meant to secure the succession to the Empire for his\r\nbrother Ferdinand, by procuring his election as King of the Romans.\r\n\r\nCharles came from Italy over the Brenner Pass in the spring time, and was\r\nmagnificently received by the Tyrolese, eager to do all honour to the\r\ngrandson of their beloved Kaiser Max. His letters to his brother, written\r\non the stages of the journey, reveal as fully as that reserved soul could\r\nunbosom itself, his plans for the pacification of Germany. He meant to use\r\nevery persuasion possible, to make what compromises his conscience\r\npermitted (for Catholicism was a faith with Charles), to effect a peaceful\r\nsettlement. But if these failed, he was determined to crush the\r\nReformation by force. He never seems to have doubted that he would\r\nsucceed. Never a thought crossed his mind that he was about to encounter a\r\ngreat spiritual force whose depth and intensity he was unable to measure,\r\nand which was slowly creating a new world unknown to himself and to his\r\ncontemporaries. While at Innsbruck he invited the Elector of Saxony to\r\nvisit him, and was somewhat disappointed that the Lutheran prince did not\r\naccept; but this foretaste of trouble did not give him any uneasiness.\r\n\r\nThe summons to the Diet, commanding the Electors, princes, and all the\r\nEstates of the Empire to meet at Augsburg on the 8th of April 1530, had\r\nbeen issued when Charles was at Bologna. No threats marred the invitation.\r\nThe Emperor announced that he meant to leave all past errors to the\r\njudgment of the Saviour; that he wished to give a charitable hearing to\r\nevery man’s opinions, thoughts, and ideas; and that his only desire was to\r\nsecure that all might live under the one Christ, in one Commonwealth, one\r\nChurch, and one Unity.(333) He left Innsbruck on the 6th of June, and,\r\ntravelling slowly, reached the bridge on the Lech, a little distance from\r\nAugsburg, on the evening of the 15th. There he found the great princes of\r\nthe Empire, who had been waiting his arrival from two o’clock in the\r\nafternoon. They alighted to do him reverence, and he graciously dismounted\r\nalso, and greeted them with all courtesy. Charles had brought the papal\r\nnuncio, Cardinal Campeggio, in his train. Most of the Electors knelt to\r\nreceive the cardinal’s blessing; but John of Saxony stood bolt upright,\r\nand refused the proffered benediction.\r\n\r\nThe procession—one of the most gorgeous Germany had ever seen—was\r\nmarshalled for the ceremonial entry into the town. The retinues of the\r\nElectors were all in their appropriate colours and arms—Saxony, by ancient\r\nprescriptive right, leading the van. Then came the Emperor alone, a\r\nbaldachino carried over his head. He had wished the nuncio and his brother\r\nto ride beside him under the canopy; but the Germans would not suffer it;\r\nno Pope’s representative was to be permitted to ride shoulder to shoulder\r\nwith the head of the German Empire entering the most important of his\r\nimperial cities.(334)\r\n\r\nAugsburg was then at the height of its prosperity. It was the great\r\ntrading centre between Italy and the Levant and the towns of Northern\r\nEurope. It was the home of the Welsers and of the Fuggers, the great\r\ncapitalists of the later mediæval Europe. It boasted that its citizens\r\nwere the equals of princes, and that its daughters, in that age of deeply\r\nrooted class distinctions, had married into princely houses. To this day\r\nthe name of one of its streets—Philippine Welser Strasse—commemorates the\r\nwedding of an heiress of the Welsers with an archduke of Austria; and the\r\nwall decorations of the old houses attest the ancient magnificence of the\r\ncity.(335)\r\n\r\nAt the gates of the town, the clergy, singing _Advenisti __\r\ndesiderabilis_, met the procession. All, Emperor, clergy, princes, and\r\ntheir retinues, entered the cathedral. The _Te Deum_ was sung, and the\r\nEmperor received the benediction. Then the procession was re-formed, and\r\naccompanied Charles to his lodgings in the Bishop’s Palace.\r\n\r\nThere the Emperor made his first attempt on his Lutheran subjects. He\r\ninvited the Elector of Saxony, George of Brandenburg, Philip of Hesse, and\r\nFrancis of Lüneburg to accompany him to his private apartments. He told\r\nthem that he had been informed that they had brought their Lutheran\r\npreachers with them to Augsburg, and that he would expect them to keep\r\nthem silent during the sittings of the Diet. They refused. Then Charles\r\nasked them to prohibit controversial sermons. This request was also\r\nrefused. In the end Charles reminded them that his demand was strictly\r\nwithin the decision of 1526; that the Emperor was lord over the imperial\r\ncities; and he promised them that he would appoint the preachers himself,\r\nand that there would be no sermons—only the reading of Scripture without\r\ncomment. This was agreed to. He next asked them to join him in the Corpus\r\nChristi procession on the following day. They refused—Philip of Hesse with\r\narguments listened to by Ferdinand with indignation, and by Charles with\r\nindifference, probably because he did not understand German. The Emperor\r\ninsisted. Then old George of Brandenburg stood forth, and told His Majesty\r\nthat he could not, and would not obey. It was a short, rugged speech,\r\nthough eminently respectful, and ended with these words, which flew over\r\nGermany, kindling hearts as fire lights flax: “Before I would deny my God\r\nand His Evangel, I would rather kneel down here before your Majesty and\r\nhave my head struck off,”—and the old man hit the side of his neck with\r\nthe edge of his hand. Charles did not need to know German to understand.\r\n“Not head off, dear prince, not head off,” he said kindly in his\r\nFlemish-German (_Nit Kop ab, löver Först, nit Kop ab_). Charles walked in\r\nprocession through the streets of Augsburg on a blazing hot day, stooping\r\nunder a heavy purple mantle, with a superfluous candle sputtering in his\r\nhand; but the evangelical princes remained in their lodgings.(336)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 6. The Diet of Augsburg 1530.(337)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Diet was formally opened on June 20th (1530), and in the _Proposition_\r\nor Speech from the Throne it was announced that the Assembly would be\r\ninvited to discuss armament against the Turk, and that His Majesty was\r\nanxious, “by fair and gentle means,” to end the religious differences\r\nwhich were distracting Germany. The Protestants were again invited to give\r\nthe Emperor in writing their opinions and difficulties. It was resolved to\r\ntake the religious question first. On June 24th the Lutherans were ready\r\nwith their “statement of their grievances and opinions relating to the\r\nfaith.” Next day (June 25th) the Diet met in the hall of the Episcopal\r\nPalace, and what is known as the _Augsburg Confession_ was read by the\r\nSaxon Chancellor, Dr. Christian Bayer, in such a clear resonant voice that\r\nit was heard not only by the audience within the chamber, but also by the\r\ncrowd which thronged the court outside.(338) When the reading was ended,\r\nChancellor Brück handed the document and a duplicate in Latin to the\r\nEmperor. They were signed by the Elector of Saxony and his son John\r\nFrederick, by George, Margrave of Brandenburg, the Dukes Ernest and\r\nFrancis of Lüneburg, the Landgrave of Hesse, Prince Wolfgang of Anhalt,\r\nand the delegates of the cities of Nürnberg and Reutlingen. These princes\r\nknew the danger which threatened them in putting their names to the\r\nConfession. The theologians of Saxony besought their Elector to permit\r\ntheir names to stand alone; but he answered calmly, _I, too, will confess\r\nmy Christ_. He was not a brilliant man like Philip of Hesse. He was\r\nunpretentious, peace-loving, and retiring by nature—John the Steadfast,\r\nhis people called him. Recent historians have dwelt on the conciliatory\r\nattitude and judicial spirit manifested by the Emperor at this Diet, and\r\nthey are justified in doing so; but the mailed hand sometimes showed\r\nitself. Charles refused to invest John with his Electoral dignities in the\r\nusual feudal fashion, and his entourage whispered that if the Elector was\r\nnot amenable to the Emperor’s arguments, he might find the electorate\r\ntaken from him and bestowed on the kindred House of Ducal Saxony, which in\r\nthe person of Duke George so stoutly supported the old religion.(339)\r\nWhile possessing that “laudable, if crabbed constitutionalism which was\r\nthe hereditary quality of the Ernestine line of Saxony,”(340) he had a\r\ngenuine affection for the Emperor. Both recognised that this Diet of\r\nAugsburg had separated them irrevocably. “Uncle, Uncle,” said Charles to\r\nElector John at their parting interview, “I did not expect this from you.”\r\nThe Elector’s eyes filled with tears; he could not speak; he turned away\r\nin silence and left the city soon afterwards.(341)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 7. The Augsburg Confession.(342)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Augsburg Confession (_Confessio Augustana_) was what it claimed to be,\r\na statement of “opinion and grievances,” and does not pretend to be a full\r\nexposition of doctrinal tenets. The men who wrote it (Melanchthon was\r\nresponsible for the phraseology) and presented it to the Diet, claimed to\r\nbelong to the ancient and visible Catholic Church, and to believe in all\r\nthe articles of faith set forth by the Universal Church, and particularly\r\nin the _Apostles’_ and _Nicene Creeds_; but they maintained that abuses\r\nhad crept in which obscured the ancient doctrines. The Confession showed\r\nwhy they could not remain in connection with an unreformed Church. Their\r\nposition is exactly defined in the opening sentence of the second part of\r\nthe Confession. “Inasmuch as the Churches among us dissent in no articles\r\nof faith from the Holy Scriptures nor the Church Catholic, and only omit a\r\nfew of certain abuses, which are novel, and have crept in with time partly\r\nand in part have been introduced by violence, and contrary to the purport\r\nof the canons, we beg that your Imperial Majesty would clemently hear both\r\nwhat ought to be changed, and what are the reasons why people ought not to\r\nbe forced against their conscience to observe these abuses.”\r\n\r\nThe Confession is often represented as an attempt to minimise the\r\ndifferences between Lutherans and Romanists and exaggerate those between\r\nLutherans and Zwinglians, and there are some grounds for the statement.\r\nMelanchthon had come back from the Diet of Speyer (1529) convinced that if\r\nthe Lutherans had separated themselves more thoroughly from the cities of\r\nSouth Germany there would have been more chance of a working compromise,\r\nand it is only natural to expect that the idea should colour his sketch of\r\nthe Lutheran position at Augsburg. Yet in the main the assertion is wrong.\r\nThe distinctively Protestant conception of the spiritual priesthood of all\r\nbelievers inspires the whole document; and this can never be brought into\r\nreal harmony with the Romanist position and claims. It is not difficult to\r\nstate Romanist and Protestant doctrine in almost identical phrases,\r\nprovided this one great dogmatic difference be for the moment set on one\r\nside. The conferences at Regensburg in 1541 (April 27-May 22) proved as\r\nmuch. No one will believe that Calvin would be inclined to minimise the\r\ndifferences between Protestants and Romanists, yet he voluntarily signed\r\nthe Augsburg Confession, and did so, he says, in the sense in which the\r\nauthor (Melanchthon) understood it. This Augsburg Confession and Luther’s\r\nShort Catechism are the symbolical books still in use in all Lutheran\r\nchurches.\r\n\r\nThe _Augsburg Confession_ (_Confessio Augustana_) is divided into two\r\nparts, the first expressing the views held by those who signed it, and the\r\nsecond stating the errors they protested against. The form and language\r\nalike show that the authors had no intention of framing an exhaustive\r\nsyllabus of theological opinions or of imposing its articles as a\r\nchangeless system of dogmatic truth. They simply meant to express what\r\nthey united in believing. Such phrases as _our Churches teach_, _it is\r\ntaught_, _such and such opinions are falsely attributed to us_, make that\r\nplain. In the first part the authors show how much they hold in common\r\nwith the mediæval Church; how they abide by the teaching of St. Augustine,\r\nthe great theologian of the West; how they differ from more radical\r\nProtestants like the Zwinglians, and repudiate the teachings of the\r\nAnabaptists. The Lutheran doctrine of Justification by Faith is given very\r\nclearly and briefly in a section by itself, but it is continually referred\r\nto and shown to be the basis of many portions of their common system of\r\nbelief. In the second part they state what things compel them to dissent\r\nfrom the views and practices of the mediæval Church—the enforced celibacy\r\nof the clergy, the sacrificial character of the Mass, the necessity of\r\nauricular confession, monastic vows, and the confusion of spiritual and\r\nsecular authority exhibited in the German episcopate.\r\n\r\nThe origin of the document was this. When the Emperor’s proclamation\r\nsummoning the Diet reached Saxony, Chancellor Gregory Brück suggested that\r\nthe Saxon theologians should prepare a statement of their opinions which\r\nmight be presented to the Emperor if called for.(343) This was done. The\r\ntheologians went to the Schwabach Articles, and Melanchthon revised them,\r\nrestated them, and made them as inoffensive as he could. The document was\r\nmeant to give the minimum for which the Protestants contended, and\r\nMelanchthon’s conciliatory spirit shows itself throughout. It embalms at\r\nthe same time some of Luther’s trenchant phrases: “Christian perfection is\r\nthis, to fear God sincerely; and again, to conceive great faith, and to\r\ntrust assuredly that God is pacified towards us for Christ’s sake; to ask,\r\nand certainly to look for, help from God in all our affairs according to\r\nour calling; and outwardly to do good works diligently, and to attend to\r\nour vocation. In these things doth true perfection and the true worship of\r\nGod consist: it doth not consist in being unmarried, in going about\r\nbegging, nor in wearing dirty clothes.” His indifference to forms of\r\nChurch government and his readiness to conserve the old appears in the\r\nsentence: “Now our meaning is not to have rule taken from the bishops; but\r\nthis one thing only is requested at their hands, that they would suffer\r\nthe gospel to be purely taught, and that they would relax a few\r\nobservances, which cannot be observed without sin.”\r\n\r\nWhen the Romanist theologians presented their Confutation of this\r\nConfession to the Emperor, it was again left to Melanchthon to draft an\r\nanswer—the _Apology of the Augsburg Confession_. The _Apology_ is about\r\nseven times longer than the _Confession_, and is a noble and learned\r\ndocument. The Emperor refused to receive it, and Melanchthon spent a long\r\ntime over it before it was allowed to be seen.\r\n\r\nAfter taking counsel with the Romanist princes (_die Chur und Fursten so\r\nbepstisch gewesen_),(344) it was resolved to hand the Confession to a\r\ncommittee of Romanist theologians whom the cardinal nuncio(345) undertook\r\nto bring together, to examine and answer it. Among them were John Eck of\r\nIngolstadt, Faber, and Cochlæus. There was little hope of arriving at a\r\ncompromise with such champions on the papal side; and Charles was soon to\r\ndiscover that his strongest opponents in effecting a peaceful solution\r\nwere the nuncio and his committee of theologians. Five times they produced\r\na confutation, and five times the Emperor and the Diet returned their\r\nwork, asking them to redraft it in milder and in less uncompromising\r\nterms.(346) The sixth draft went far beyond the wishes of Charles, but the\r\nEmperor had to accept it and let it appear as the statement of his\r\nbeliefs. It made reconciliation hopeless.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 8. The Reformation to be crushed.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe religious difficulty had not been removed by compromise. There\r\nremained force—the other alternative foreshadowed by the Emperor. The time\r\nseemed to be opportune. Protestantism was divided, and had flaunted its\r\ndifferences in the Emperor’s presence. Philip of Hesse had signed the\r\nAugsburg Confession with hesitation, not because he did not believe its\r\nstatements, but because it seemed to shut the door on a complete union\r\namong all the parties who had joined in the Protest of 1529. The four\r\ncities of Strassburg, Constance, Lindau, and Memmingen had submitted a\r\nseparate Confession (the _Confessio Tetrapolitana_) to the Emperor; and\r\nthe Romanist theologians had written a confutation of it also. Zwingli had\r\nsent a third.\r\n\r\nLuther was not among the theologians present at the Diet of Augsburg.\r\nTechnically he was still an outlaw, for the ban of the Diet of Worms had\r\nnever been legally removed. The Elector had asked him to stay at his\r\nCastle of Coburg. There he remained, worried and anxious, chafing like a\r\ncaged eagle. He feared that Melanchthon’s conciliatory spirit might make\r\nhim barter away some indispensable parts of evangelical truth; he feared\r\nthe impetuosity of the Landgrave of Hesse and his known Zwinglian\r\nsympathies. His secretary wrote to Wittenberg that he was fretting himself\r\nill; he was longing to get back to Wittenberg, where he could at least\r\nteach his students. It was then that Catharine got their friend Lucas\r\nCranach to paint their little daughter Magdalena, just twelve months old,\r\nand sent it to her husband that he might have a small bit of home to cheer\r\nhim. Luther hung the picture up where he could always see it from his\r\nchair, and he tells us that the sweet little face looking down upon him\r\ngave him courage during his dreary months of waiting. Posts brought him\r\nnews from the Diet: that the Confession had been read to the Estates; that\r\nthe Romanists were preparing a Confutation; that their reply was ready on\r\nAugust 3rd; that Philip of Hesse had left the Diet abruptly on the 6th, to\r\nraise troops to fight the Emperor, it was reported; that Melanchthon was\r\nbeing entangled in conferences, and was giving up everything. His strong\r\nardent nature pours itself forth in his letters from Coburg (April\r\n18th-Oct. 4th)—urging his friends to tell him how matters are going;\r\nwarning Melanchthon to stand firm; taking comfort in the text, “Be ye\r\nangry, and sin not”; comparing the Diet to the rooks and the rookery in\r\nthe trees below his window.(347) It was from Coburg that he wrote his\r\ncharming letter to his small son.(348) It was there that he penned the\r\nletter of encouragement to the tried and loyal Chancellor Brück:\r\n\r\n\r\n    “I have lately seen two wonders: the first as I was looking out of\r\n    my window and saw the stars in heaven and all that beautiful vault\r\n    of God, and yet I saw no pillars on which the Master-Builder had\r\n    fixed this vault; yet the heavens fell not, and the great vault\r\n    stood fast. Now there are some who search for the pillars, and\r\n    want to touch and to grasp them; and when they cannot, they wonder\r\n    and tremble as if the heaven must certainly fall, just because\r\n    they cannot grasp its pillars. If they could only lay their hands\r\n    on them, they think that the heaven would stand firm!\r\n\r\n    “The second wonder was: I saw great clouds rolling over us with\r\n    such a ponderous weight that they seemed like a great ocean, and\r\n    yet I saw no foundation on which they rested or were based, and no\r\n    shore which bounded them; yet they fell not, but frowned on us and\r\n    flowed on. But when they had passed by, then there shone forth\r\n    both their floor and our roof, which had kept them back—a rainbow!\r\n    A frail, thin floor and roof which soon melted into the clouds,\r\n    and was more like a shadowy prism, such as we see through coloured\r\n    glass, than a strong, firm foundation, and we might well distrust\r\n    the feeble rampart which kept back that fearful weight of waters.\r\n    Yet we found that this unsubstantial prism was able to bear up the\r\n    weight of waters, and that it guarded us safely! But there are\r\n    some who look more to the thickness and massive weight of the\r\n    waters and the clouds than at this thin, light, narrow bow of\r\n    promise. They would like to feel the strength of that shadowy\r\n    vanishing arch, and because they cannot do this, they are always\r\n    fearing that the clouds will bring back the flood.”(349)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Protestants never seemed to be in a worse plight; but, as Luther\r\nwrote, the threatened troubles passed away—for this time at least.\r\n\r\nCampeggio was keen to crush the Reformation at once. His letters to the\r\nCuria insist that the policy of the strong arm is the only effectual way\r\nof dealing with the Lutheran princes. But Charles found that some of the\r\nSouth German princes who were eager that no compromise should be made with\r\nthe Lutherans, were very unwilling to coerce them by force of arms. They\r\nhad no wish to see the Emperor all-powerful in Germany. The Romanist Dukes\r\nof Bavaria (the Wittelsbachs) were as strongly anti-Hapsburg as Philip of\r\nHesse himself; and Charles had no desire to stir the anti-Hapsburg\r\nfeeling. Instead, conferences(350) were proposed to see whether some\r\nmutual understanding might not after all be reached; and the Diet was\r\ncareful to introduce laymen, in the hope that they would be less\r\nuncompromising than the Romanist theologians. The meetings ended without\r\nany definite result. The Protestant princes refused to make the needful\r\nconcessions, and Charles found his plans thwarted on every side. Whereupon\r\nthe Romanist majority of the Diet framed a “recess,” which declared that\r\nthe Protestants were to be allowed to exist unmolested until April 15th,\r\n1531; and were then to be put down by force. Meanwhile they were ordered\r\nto make no more innovations in worship or in doctrine; they were to\r\nrefrain from molesting the Romanists within their territories; and they\r\nwere to aid the Emperor and the Romanist princes in stamping out the\r\npartisans of Zwingli and the Anabaptists. This resolution gave rise to a\r\nsecond Protest, signed by the Lutheran princes and by the fourteen cities.\r\n\r\nNothing had stirred the wrath of Charles so much as the determined stand\r\ntaken by the cities. He conceived that he, the Emperor, was the supreme\r\nLord within an imperial city; and he employed persuasion and threats to\r\nmake their delegates accept the “recess.” Even Augsburg refused.\r\n\r\nHaving made their Protest, the Lutheran princes and the delegates from the\r\nprotesting towns left the Diet, careless of what the Romanist majority\r\nmight further do. In their absence an important ordinance was passed. The\r\nDiet decided that the Edict of Worms was to be executed; that the\r\necclesiastical jurisdictions were to be preserved, and all Church property\r\nto be restored; and, what was most important, that the Imperial Court of\r\nAppeals for all disputed legal cases within the Empire (the\r\n_Reichskammersgericht_) should be restored. The last provision indicated a\r\nnew way of fighting the extending Protestantism by harassing legal\r\nprosecutions, which, from the nature of the court, were always to be\r\ndecided against the dissenters from the ecclesiastical jurisdiction of the\r\nmediæval Empire.(351) All instances of seizure of ecclesiastical\r\nbenefices, all defiances of episcopal decisions, could be appealed against\r\nto this central court; and as the legal principles on which it gave its\r\ndecisions and the controlling authorities which it recognised were\r\nmediæval, the Protestants could never hope for a decision in their favour.\r\nThe Lutheran Church in Saxony, for example, with its pastors and\r\nschoolmasters, was supported by moneys taken from the old ecclesiastical\r\nfoundations. According to this decision of the Diet, every case of such\r\ntransfer of property could be appealed to this central court, which from\r\nits constitution was bound to decide against the transfer. If the\r\nProtestant princes disregarded the decisions of the central court, the\r\nEmperor was within his rights in treating them as men who had outraged the\r\nconstitution of the Empire.(352)\r\n\r\nCharles met at Augsburg the first great check in his hitherto successful\r\ncareer, but he was tenacious of purpose, and never cared to hurry matters\r\nto an irrevocable conclusion. He carefully studied the problem, and three\r\nways of dealing with the religious difficulty shaped themselves in his\r\nmind at Augsburg—by compromise, by letting the Protestants alone for a\r\nperiod longer or shorter, and by a General Council which would be free. It\r\nwould seem that at Augsburg he first seriously resolved that the condition\r\nof Europe was such that the Pope must be _compelled_ to summon a Council,\r\nand to allow it freedom of debate and action. Charles tried all three\r\nplans in Germany during the fifteen years that followed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 9. The Schmalkald League.(353)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Emperor published the decision of the Diet on the 19th of November,\r\nand the Protestants had to arrange some common plan of facing the\r\nsituation. They met, princes and delegates of cities, in the little upland\r\ntown of Schmalkalden, lying on the south-west frontier of Electoral\r\nSaxony, circled by low hills which were white with snow (December 22-31).\r\nThey had to face at once harassing litigation, and, after the 15th of\r\nApril, the threat that they would be stamped out by force of arms. Were\r\nthey still to maintain their doctrine of passive resistance? The question\r\nwas earnestly debated. Think of these earnest German princes and burghers,\r\ntheir lives and property at stake, debating this abstract question day\r\nafter day, resolute to set their own consciences right before coming to\r\nany resolution to defend themselves! The lawyers were all on the side of\r\nactive defence. The terms of the bond were drafted. The Emperor’s name was\r\ncarefully omitted; and the causes which compelled them to take action were\r\nrather alluded to vaguely than stated with precision. The Elector of\r\nSaxony, the Landgrave of Hesse, the Duke of Lüneburg, the Prince of\r\nAnhalt, the two Counts of Mansfeld, and the delegates from Magdeburg and\r\nBremen signed. Pious old George of Brandenburg was not convinced that it\r\nwas lawful to resist the Emperor; the deputies of Nürnberg had grave\r\ndoubts also. Many others who were present felt that they must have time to\r\nmake up their minds. But the league was started, and was soon to assume\r\nhuge proportions.\r\n\r\nThe confederates had confessed the new doctrines, and had published their\r\nConfession. They now resolved that they would defend themselves if\r\nattacked by litigation or otherwise. There was no attempt to exclude the\r\nSouth German cities; and Charles’ expectations that theological\r\ndifferences would prevent Protestant union within Germany were frustrated.\r\nZwingli’s heroic death at Cappel (October 11th, 1531) softened all\r\nProtestant hearts towards his followers. The South German cities followed\r\nthe lead of Bucer, who was anxious for union. Many of these towns now\r\njoined the Schmalkald League. Brunswick joined. Hamburg and Rostock in the\r\nfar north, Goslar and Göttingen in the centre, joined. Almost all North\r\nGermany and the more important imperial towns in the South were united in\r\none strong confederacy by this Schmalkald League. It became one of the\r\nEuropean Powers. Denmark wished to join. Thomas Cromwell was anxious that\r\nEngland should join. The league was necessarily anti-Hapsburg, and the\r\nEmperor had to reckon with it.\r\n\r\nIts power appeared at the Diet of Nürnberg in 1532. The dreaded day (April\r\n15th, 1531) on which the Protestants were to be reduced by fire and sword\r\npassed quietly by. Charles was surrounded with difficulties which made it\r\nimpossible for him to carry out the threats he had published on November\r\n19th, 1530. The Turks were menacing Vienna and the Duchy of Austria; the\r\nPope was ready to take advantage of any signs of imperial weakness; France\r\nwas irreconcilable; England was hostile; and the Bavarian dukes were doing\r\nwhat they could to lessen the Hapsburg power in Germany.\r\n\r\nWhen the Diet met at Nürnberg in 1532, the Emperor knew that he was unable\r\nto coerce the Lutherans, and returned to his earlier courteous way of\r\ntreating them. They were more patriotic than the German Romanists for whom\r\nhe had done so much. Luther declared roundly that the Turks must be met\r\nand driven back, and that all Germans must support the Emperor in\r\nrepelling the invasion. At the Diet a “recess” was proposed, in which the\r\nreligious truce was indefinitely extended; the processes against the\r\nProtestants in the _Reichskammersgericht_ were to be quashed, and no State\r\nwas to be proceeded against in matters arising out of religious\r\ndifferences. The Romanist members refused to accept it; the “recess” was\r\nnever published. But the Protestant States declared that they would trust\r\nin the imperial word of honour, and furnished the Emperor with troops for\r\nthe defence of Vienna, and the invasion was repelled.\r\n\r\nThe history of the struggle in Germany between the Diet of 1532 and the\r\noutbreak of war in 1546 is very intricate, and cannot be told as a simple\r\ncontest between Reformation and anti-Reformation.\r\n\r\nIn the sixteenth century, almost all thoughtful and earnest-minded men\r\ndesired a Reformation of the Church. The Roman Curia was the only opponent\r\nto all reforms of any kind. But two different ideas of what Reformation\r\nought to be, divided the men who longed for reforms. The one desired to\r\nsee the benumbed and formalist mediæval Church filled with a new religious\r\nlife, while it retained its notable characteristics of a sacerdotal\r\nministry and a visible external unity under a uniform hierarchy\r\nculminating in the Papacy. The other wished to free the human spirit from\r\nthe fetters of a merely ecclesiastical authority, and to rebuild the\r\nChurch on the principle of the spiritual priesthood of all believing men\r\nand women. In the struggle in Germany the Emperor Charles may be taken as\r\nthe embodiment of the first, as Luther represented the second. To the one\r\nit seemed essential to maintain the external unity and authority of the\r\nChurch according to the mediæval ideal; the other could content himself\r\nwith seeing the Church of the Middle Ages broken up into territorial\r\nChurches, each of which he contended was a portion of the one visible\r\nCatholic Church. Charles had no difficulty in accepting many changes in\r\ndoctrine and usages, provided a genuine and lasting compromise could be\r\narrived at which would retain all within the one ecclesiastical\r\norganisation. He consented once and again to suspend the struggle; but he\r\nwould never have made himself responsible for a permanent religious\r\nsettlement which recognised the Lutheran Churches. He had no objection to\r\na truce, but would never accept a lasting peace. If the Lutherans could\r\nnot be brought back within the mediæval Church by compromise, then he was\r\nprepared to go to all extremes to compel them to return. Of course, he was\r\nthe ruler over many lands; he was keen to extend and consolidate the\r\nfamily possessions of his House,—as keen as the most grasping of the petty\r\nterritorial princes,—and he had to be an opportunist. But he never\r\ndeviated in the main from his idea of how the religious difficulty should\r\nbe solved.\r\n\r\nBut all manner of political and personal motives were at work on both\r\nsides in Germany (as elsewhere). Philip of Hesse combined a strenuous\r\nacceptance of the principles of the Lutheran Reformation with as thorough\r\na hatred of the House of Hapsburg and of its supremacy in Germany. The\r\nDukes of Bavaria, who were the strongest partisans of the Romanist Church\r\nin Germany, were the hereditary enemies of the House of Austria. The\r\nreligious pacification of the Fatherland was made impossible to Charles,\r\nnot merely by his insistence on maintaining the conceptions of the\r\nmediæval Church, but also by open and secret reluctance to see the\r\nimperial authority increased, and by jealousies aroused by the territorial\r\naggrandisement of the House of Hapsburg. The incompatibility between the\r\naims of the Emperor and those of his indispensable ally, the Pope, added\r\nto the difficulties of the situation.\r\n\r\nIn 1534, Philip of Hesse persuaded the Schmalkald League to espouse the\r\ncause of the banished Duke of Würtemberg. His territories had been\r\nincorporated into the family possessions of the Hapsburgs, and the people\r\ngroaned under the imperial administration. The Swabian League, which had\r\nbeen the mainstay of the Imperialist and Romanist cause in South Germany,\r\nwas persuaded to remain neutral by the Dukes of Bavaria, and Philip had\r\nlittle difficulty in defeating Ferdinand, and driving the Imperialists out\r\nof the Duchy. Ulrich was restored, declared in favour of the Lutheran\r\nReformation, and Würtemberg was added to the list of Protestant States. By\r\nthe terms of the Peace of Cadan (June 1534), Ferdinand publicly engaged to\r\ncarry out Charles’ private assurance that no Protestant was to be dragged\r\nbefore the _Reichskammersgericht_ for anything connected with\r\nreligion.(354) Another important consequence followed. The Swabian League\r\nwas dissolved in 1536. This left the Schmalkald League of Protestant\r\nStates and cities the only formidable confederation in Germany.\r\n\r\nThe political union among the Protestants suggested a closer\r\napproximation. The South German pastors asked to meet Luther and discuss\r\ntheir theological differences. They met at Wittenberg, and after prolonged\r\ndiscussion it was found that all were agreed save on one small point—the\r\npresence, _extended in space_, of the Body of Christ in the elements in\r\nthe Holy Supper. It was agreed that this might be left an open question;\r\nand what was called the _Wittenberg Concord_ was signed, which united all\r\nGerman Protestants (May and June 1536).(355)\r\n\r\nThree years later (1539), Duke George of Saxony died, the most honest and\r\ndisinterested of the Romanist princes. His brother Henry, who succeeded\r\nhim, with the joyful consent of his subjects, pronounced for the\r\nEvangelical faith. Nothing would content him but that Luther should come\r\nto Leipzig to preside clerically on so auspicious an occasion. Luther\r\npreached in the great hall of the Castle, where twenty years earlier he\r\nhad confronted Eck, and had heard Duke George declare that his opinions\r\nwere pestilential.\r\n\r\nIn the same year the new Elector of Brandenburg also came over to the\r\nEvangelical side amid the rejoicings of his people; and the two great\r\nRomanist States of North Germany, Electoral Brandenburg and Ducal Saxony,\r\nbecame Protestant.\r\n\r\nThe tide flowed so strongly that the three clerical Electors, the\r\nArchbishops of Mainz, Köln, and Trier, and some of the bishops,\r\ncontemplated secularising their principalities, and becoming Protestants.\r\nThis alarmed Charles thoroughly. If the proposed secularisation took\r\nplace, there would be a large Protestant majority in the Electoral\r\nCollege, and the next Emperor would be a Protestant.\r\n\r\nCharles had been anxiously watching the gradual decadence of the power of\r\nthe Romanist princes in Germany; and reports convinced him that the\r\nadvance of the Reformation among the people was still more marked. The\r\nRoman Catholic Church seemed to be in the agonies of dissolution even in\r\nplaces where it had hitherto been strong. Breslau, once strongly Romanist,\r\nwas now almost fanatically Lutheran; in Vienna, Bishop Faber wrote, the\r\npopulation was entirely Lutheran, save himself and the Archduke. The\r\nRomanist Universities were almost devoid of students. In Bavaria, it was\r\nsaid that there were more monasteries than monks. Candidates for the\r\npriesthood had diminished in a very startling way: the nuncio Vergerio\r\nreported that he could find none in Bohemia except a few paupers who could\r\nnot pay their ordination fees.\r\n\r\nThe policy of the Pope (Paul III., 1534-1549) had disgusted the German\r\nRomanist princes. He subordinated the welfare of the Church in their\r\ndominions to his anti-Hapsburg Italian schemes, and had actually allied\r\nhimself with Francis of France, who was intriguing with the Turks, in\r\norder to thwart the Emperor! The action and speeches of Henry VIII. had\r\nbeen watched and studied by the German Romanist leaders. Could they not\r\nimitate him in Germany, and create a Nationalist Church true to mediæval\r\ndoctrine, hierarchy, and ritual, and yet independent of the Pope, who\r\ncared so little for them?\r\n\r\nAll these things made Charles and Ferdinand revise their policy. The\r\nEmperor began to consider seriously whether the way out of the religious\r\ndifficulty might not be, either to grant a prolonged truce to the\r\nLutherans (which might, though he hoped not, become permanent), or to work\r\nenergetically for the creation of a German National Church, which, by\r\nmeans of some working compromise in doctrines and ceremonies, might be\r\ncalled into existence by a German National Council assembled in defiance\r\nof the Pope.\r\n\r\nIt was with these thoughts in his mind that he sent his Chancellor Held\r\ninto Germany to strengthen the Romanist cause there. His agent soon\r\nabandoned the larger ideas of his master, if he ever comprehended them,\r\nand contented himself with announcing publicly that the private promise\r\ngiven by Charles at Nürnberg, and confirmed by Ferdinand at the Peace of\r\nCadan, was withdrawn. The lawsuits brought against the Protestants in the\r\n_Reichskammersgericht_ were not to be quashed, but were to be prosecuted\r\nto the bitter end. He also contrived at Nürnberg (June 1538) to form a\r\nleague of Romanist princes, ostensibly for defence, but really to force\r\nthe Protestants to submit to the decisions of the _Reichskammersgericht_.\r\nThese measures did not make for peace; they almost produced a civil war,\r\nwhich was only avoided by the direct interposition of the Emperor.\r\n\r\nChancellor Held was recalled, and the Emperor sent the Archbishop of Lund\r\nto find out what terms the Protestants would accept. These proved larger\r\nthan the Emperor could grant, but the result of the intercourse was that\r\nthe Protestants were granted a truce which was to last for ten years.\r\n\r\nThe proposed secularisation of the ecclesiastical Electorates made Charles\r\nsee that he dared not wait for the conclusion of this truce. He set\r\nhimself earnestly to discover whether compromises in doctrine and\r\nceremonies were not possible. Conferences were held between Lutheran and\r\nRomanist theologians and laymen, at Hagenau (June 1540), at Worms\r\n(November 1540), and at Regensburg (Ratisbon, April 1541).(356) The last\r\nwas the most important. The discussions showed that it was possible to\r\nstate Romanist and Lutheran doctrine in ambiguous propositions which could\r\nbe accepted by the theologians of both Confessions; but that there was a\r\ngreat gulf between them which the Evangelicals would never re-cross. The\r\nspiritual priesthood of all believers could never be reconciled with the\r\nspecial priesthood of the mediæval clergy. This was Charles’ last attempt\r\nat a compromise which would unite of their own free will the German\r\nLutherans with the German Romanists. He saw that the Lutherans would never\r\nreturn to the mediæval Church unless compelled by force, and it was\r\nimpossible to use force unless the Schmalkald League was broken up\r\naltogether or seamed with divisions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 10. The Bigamy of Philip of Hesse.(357)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe opportunity arrived. The triumphant Protestantism received its\r\nseverest blow in the bigamy of Philip of Hesse, which involved the\r\nreputations of Bucer, Luther, and Melanchthon, as well as of the\r\nLandgrave.\r\n\r\nPhilip had married when barely nineteen a daughter of Duke George of\r\nSaxony. Latterly, he declared that it was impossible to maintain conjugal\r\nrelations with her; that continence was impossible for him; that the\r\ncondition in which he found himself harassed his whole life, and prevented\r\nhim coming to the Lord’s Table. In a case like his, Pope Clement VII. only\r\na few years previously had permitted the husband to take a second wife,\r\nand why should not the Protestant divines permit him? He prepared a case\r\nfor himself which he submitted to the theologians, and got a reply signed\r\nby Bucer, Melanchthon, and Luther, which may be thus summarised:—\r\n\r\n\r\n    According to the original commandment of God, marriage is between\r\n    one man and one woman, and the twain shall become one flesh, and\r\n    this original precept has been confirmed by our Lord; but sin\r\n    brought it about that first Lamech, then the heathen, and then\r\n    Abraham, took more than one wife, and this was permitted by the\r\n    law. We are now living under the gospel, which does not give\r\n    prescribed rules for the regulation of the external life, and it\r\n    has not expressly prohibited bigamy. The existing law of the land\r\n    has gone back to the original requirement of God, and the plain\r\n    duty of the pastorate is to insist on that original requirement of\r\n    God, and to denounce bigamy in every way. Nevertheless the\r\n    pastorate, in individual cases of the direst need, and to prevent\r\n    worse, may sanction bigamy in a purely exceptional way; such a\r\n    bigamous marriage is a true marriage (the necessity being proved)\r\n    in the sight of God and of conscience; but it is not a true\r\n    marriage with reference to public law or custom. Therefore such a\r\n    marriage ought to be kept secret, and the dispensation which is\r\n    given for it ought to be kept under the seal of confession. If it\r\n    be made known, the dispensation becomes _eo ipso_ invalid, and the\r\n    marriage becomes mere concubinage.\r\n\r\n\r\nSuch was the strange and scandalous document to which Luther, Melanchthon,\r\nand Bucer appended their names.\r\n\r\nOf course the thing could not be kept secret, and the moral effect of the\r\nrevelation was disastrous among friends and foes. The Evangelical princes\r\nwere especially aggrieved; and it was proposed that the Landgrave should\r\nbe tried for bigamy and punished according to the laws of the Empire. When\r\nthe matter was brought before the Emperor, he decided that no marriage had\r\ntaken place, and the sole effect of the decision of the theologians was to\r\ndeceive a poor maiden.(358)\r\n\r\nPhilip, humiliated and sore, isolated from his friends, was an instrument\r\nready to the Emperor’s hand in his plan to weaken and, if possible,\r\ndestroy the Schmalkald League. The opportunity soon arrived. The father of\r\nWilliam Duke of Cleves Juliers and Berg had been elected by the Estates of\r\nGuelders to be their sovereign, in defiance of a treaty which had secured\r\nthe succession to Charles. The father died, and the son succeeded almost\r\nimmediately after the treaty had been signed. This created a powerful\r\nanti-Hapsburg State in close proximity to the Emperor’s possessions in the\r\nNetherlands. William of Cleves had married his sister Sibylla to John\r\nFrederick, the Elector of Saxony, and naturally gravitated towards the\r\nSchmalkald League. In 1541 an arrangement was come to between the Emperor\r\nand Philip, according to which Philip guaranteed to prevent the Duke of\r\nCleves from joining the League, or at least from being supported by it\r\nagainst the Emperor, and in return Philip was promised indemnity for all\r\npast deeds, and advancement in the Emperor’s service. Young Maurice of\r\nDucal Saxony, who had succeeded his father in the Duchy (August 18th,\r\n1541), and had married Philip’s daughter, also joined in this bargain. The\r\nEmperor had thus divided the great Protestant League; for the Elector of\r\nSaxony refused to desert his brother-in-law. In 1543 the Emperor fell upon\r\nthe unbefriended Duke, totally defeated him, and took Guelders from him,\r\nwhile the German Protestants, hindered by Philip, saw one of their most\r\nimportant allies overthrown. This gave rise to recriminations, which\r\neffectually weakened the Protestant cause.\r\n\r\nIn 1544, Charles concluded a peace with France (the Peace of Crépy,\r\nNovember 19th), and was free to turn his attention to affairs in Germany.\r\nHe forced the Pope in the same month to give way about a General Council,\r\nwhich was fixed to meet in March 1545. The Emperor meant this Council to\r\nbe an instrument in his hands to subdue both the Protestants and the Pope.\r\nHe meant it to reform the Church in the sense of freeing it from many of\r\nthe corruptions which had found their way into it, and especially in\r\ndiminishing the power of the Roman Curia; and in this he was supported by\r\nthe Spanish bishops and by the greater part of Latin Christendom. But the\r\nPope was the more skilful diplomatist, and out-generalled the Emperor. The\r\nCouncil was summoned to meet at Trent, a purely Italian town, though\r\nnominally within Germany. It was arranged that all its members must be\r\npresent personally and not by deputies, which meant that the Italian\r\nbishops had a permanent majority; and the choice of Dominicans and Jesuits\r\nas the leading theologians made it plain that no doctrinal concessions\r\nwould be made to the Protestants. From the first the Protestants refused\r\nto be bound in any way by its decisions, and Charles soon perceived that\r\nthe instrument he had counted on had broken in his hands. If\r\necclesiastical unity was to be maintained in Germany, it could only be by\r\nthe use of force. There is no doubt that the Emperor was loath to proceed\r\nto this last extremity; but his correspondence with his sister Mary and\r\nwith his brother Ferdinand shows that he had come to regard it as a\r\nnecessity by the middle of 1545.\r\n\r\nHis first endeavour was to break up the Protestant League, which was once\r\nmore united. He attempted again to detach Philip of Hesse, but without\r\nsuccess. He was able, however, to induce the Elector of Brandenburg and\r\nthe Margrave of Brandenburg-Culmbach and some others to remain neutral—the\r\nElector by promising in any event that the religious settlement which had\r\nbeen effected in Brandenburg (1541) should remain unaltered; and, what\r\nserved him best, he persuaded young Maurice of Ducal Saxony to become his\r\nactive ally.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 11. Maurice of Saxony.\r\n\r\n\r\nMaurice of Saxony was one of the most interesting, because one of the most\r\nperplexing personalities of his time, which was rich in interesting\r\npersonalities. He was a Protestant from conviction, and never wavered from\r\nhis faith; yet in the conflict between the Romanist Emperor and the\r\nProtestant princes he took the Emperor’s side, and contributed more than\r\nany one else to the overthrow of his fellow Protestants. His bargain with\r\nCharles was that the Electorate should be transferred from the Ernestine\r\nSaxon family to his own, the Albertine, that he should get Magdeburg and\r\nHalberstadt, and that neither he nor his people should be subject to the\r\ndecrees of the Council of Trent. Then, when he had despoiled the rival\r\nfamily of the Electorate, he planned and carried through the successful\r\nrevolt of the Protestant princes against the Emperor, and was mainly\r\ninstrumental in securing the public recognition of Lutheranism in Germany\r\nand in gaining the permanent Religious Peace of 1555.(359)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 12. Luther’s Death.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was in these months, while the alarms of war were threatening Germany,\r\nthat Luther passed away. He had been growing weaker year by year, and had\r\nnever spared himself for the cause he had at heart. One last bit of work\r\nhe thought he must do. The Counts of Mansfeld had quarrelled over some\r\ntrifling things in the division of their property, and had consented to\r\naccept Luther’s mediation. This obliged him to journey to Eisleben in\r\nbitterly cold weather (January 1546). “I would cheerfully lay down my\r\nbones in the grave if I could only reconcile my dear Lords,” he said; and\r\nthat was what was required from him. He finished the arbitration to the\r\nsatisfaction of both brothers, and received by way of fee endowments for\r\nvillage schools in the Mansfeld region. The deeds were all signed by the\r\n17th of February (1546), and Luther’s work was done at Mansfeld—and for\r\nhis generation. He became alarmingly ill that night, and died on the\r\nfollowing morning, long before dawn. “Reverend Father,” said Justus Jonas,\r\nwho was with him, “wilt thou stand by Christ and the doctrine thou hast\r\npreached?” The dying man roused himself to say “Yes.” It was his last\r\nword. Twenty minutes later he passed away with a deep sigh.\r\n\r\nLuther died in his sixty-third year—twenty-eight and a half years after he\r\nhad, greatly daring, nailed his Theses to the door of All Saints’ in\r\nWittenberg, twenty-seven after he had discovered the meaning of his Theses\r\nduring the memorable days when he faced Eck at Leipzig, and twenty-five\r\nafter he had stood before the Emperor and Diet at Worms, while all Germany\r\nhad hailed him as its champion against the Pope and the Spaniard. The\r\nyears between 1519 and 1524 were, from an external point of view, the most\r\nglorious of Luther’s life. He dominated and led his nation, and gave a\r\nunity to that distracted and divided country which it had never enjoyed\r\nuntil then. He spoke and felt like a prophet. “I have the gospel, not from\r\nmen, but from heaven through our Lord Jesus Christ, so that I might have\r\ndescribed myself and have glorified in being a minister and an\r\nevangelist.” The position had come to him in no sudden visionary way. He\r\nhad been led into it step by step, forced forward slowly by a power\r\nstronger than his own; and the knowledge had kept him humble before his\r\nGod. During these years it seemed as if his dream—an expectation shared by\r\nhis wise Elector, the most experienced statesman in Germany—of a Germany\r\nunited under one National Church, separated from the bondage of Rome,\r\nrepudiating her blasphemies, rejecting her traditions which had corrupted\r\nthe religion of the ancient and purer days, and disowning her presumptuous\r\nencroachments on the domain of the civil power ordained of God, was about\r\nto come true.\r\n\r\nThen came the disillusionment of the Peasants’ War, when the dragon’s\r\nteeth were sown broadcast over Germany, and produced their crop of gloomy\r\nsuspicions and black fears. After the insurrection had spent itself, and\r\nin spite of the almost irretrievable damage which it, and the use made of\r\nit by papal diplomatists, did to the Reformation movement, Luther regained\r\nhis serene courage, and recovered much of the ground which had been lost.\r\nBut the crushing blow had left its mark upon him. He had the same trust in\r\nGod, but much more distrust of man, fearing the “tumult,” resolute to have\r\nnothing to do with anyone who had any connection, however slight, with\r\nthose who had instigated the misguided peasants. He rallied the forces of\r\nthe Reformation, and brought them back to discipline by the faith they had\r\nin himself as their leader. His personality dominated those kinglets of\r\nGermany, possessed with as strong a sense of their dignity and autocratic\r\nrights as any Tudor or Valois, and they submitted to be led by him.\r\nElectoral Saxony, Hesse, Lüneburg, Anhalt, East Prussia, and Mansfeld, and\r\nsome score of imperial cities, had followed him loyally from the first;\r\nand as the years passed, Ducal Saxony and Würtemberg in the centre and\r\nsouth, and Brandenburg in the north, had declared themselves Protestant\r\nStates. These larger principalities brought in their train all the smaller\r\nsatellite States which clustered round them. It may be said that before\r\nLuther’s death the much larger portion of the German Empire had been won\r\nfor evangelical religion,—a territory to be roughly described as a great\r\ntriangle, whose base was the shores of the Baltic Sea from the Netherlands\r\non the west to the eastern limits of East Prussia, and whose apex was\r\nSwitzerland. Part of this land was occupied by ecclesiastical\r\nprincipalities which had remained Roman Catholic,—the districts\r\nsurrounding Köln on the west, and the territories of Paderborn, Fulda, and\r\nmany others in the centre,—but, on the other hand, many stoutly Protestant\r\ncities, like Nürnberg, Constance, and Augsburg, were planted on\r\nterritories which were outside these limits. The extent and power of this\r\nProtestant Germany was sufficient to resist any attempt on the part of the\r\nEmperor and the Catholic princes to overcome it by force of arms, provided\r\nonly its rulers remained true to each other.\r\n\r\nOver this wide extent of country Evangelical Churches had been\r\nestablished, and provisions had been made for the education of children\r\nand for the support of the poor in ordinances issued by the supreme\r\nsecular authorities who ruled over its multitudinous divisions. The Mass,\r\nwith its supposed substitutionary sacrifice and a mediatorial priesthood,\r\nhad been abolished. The German tongue had displaced mediæval Latin in\r\npublic worship, and the worshippers could take part in the services with\r\nfull understanding of the solemn acts in which they were engaged. A German\r\nBible lay on every pulpit, and the people had their copies in the pews.\r\nTranslations of the Psalms and German evangelical hymns were sung, and\r\nsermons in German were preached. Pains were taken to provide an educated\r\nevangelical ministry who would preach the gospel faithfully, and\r\nconscientiously fulfil all the duties connected with the “cure of souls.”\r\nThe ecclesiastical property of the mediæval Church was largely used for\r\nevangelical purposes. There was no mechanical uniformity in these new\r\narrangements. Luther refused to act the part of an ecclesiastical\r\nautocrat: he advised when called upon to give advice, he never commanded.\r\nNo Wittenberg “use” was to confront the Roman “use” and be the only mode\r\nof service and ecclesiastical organisation.\r\n\r\nThe movement Luther had inaugurated had gone far beyond Germany before\r\n1546. Every country in Europe had felt its pulsations. As early as 1519\r\n(April), learned men in Paris had been almost feverishly studying his\r\nwritings.(360) They were eagerly read in England before 1521.(361)\r\nAleander, writing from Worms to the Curia, complains that Spanish\r\nmerchants were getting translations of Luther’s books made for circulation\r\nin Spain.(362) They were being studied with admiration in Italy even\r\nearlier. The Scottish Parliament was vainly endeavouring to prevent their\r\nentrance into that country by 1525.(363) The Lutheran Reformation had been\r\nlegally established in Denmark, Norway, and Sweden long before Luther\r\npassed away.\r\n\r\nLuther was the one great man of his generation, standing head and\r\nshoulders above everyone else. This does not mean that he absorbed in his\r\nindividual personality everything that the age produced for the\r\nfurtherance of humanity. Many impulses for good existed in that sixteenth\r\ncentury which Luther never recognised; for an age is always richer than\r\nany one man belonging to it. He stood outside the great artistic movement.\r\nHe might have learned much from Erasmus on the one hand, and from the\r\nleaders of the Peasants’ War on the other, which remained hidden from him.\r\nHe is greatest in the one sphere of religion only—in the greatest of all\r\nspheres. His conduct towards Zwingli and the strong language he used in\r\nspeaking of opponents make our generation discover a strain of intolerance\r\nwe would fain not see in so great a man; but his contemporaries did not\r\nand could not pass the same judgment upon him. In such a divided Germany\r\nnone but a man of the widest tolerance could have held together the\r\nProtestant forces as Luther did; and we can see what he was when we\r\nremember the sad effects of the petty orthodoxies of the Amsdorfs and the\r\nOsianders who came after him.\r\n\r\nIt is the fate of most authors of revolutions to be devoured by the\r\nmovement which they have called into being. Luther occasioned the greatest\r\nrevolution which Western Europe has ever seen, and he ruled it till his\r\ndeath. History shows no kinglier man than this Thuringian miner’s son.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 13. The Religious War.(364)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe war began soon after Luther’s death. The Emperor brought into Germany\r\nhis Spanish infantry, the beginning of what was to be a curse to that\r\ncountry for many generations, and various manœuvrings and skirmishes took\r\nplace, the most important of which was Maurice of Saxony’s invasion of the\r\nElectorate. At last the Emperor met the Elector in battle at Mühlberg\r\n(April 24th, 1547), where John Frederick was completely defeated and taken\r\nprisoner. Wittenberg, stoutly defended by Sibylla, soon after surrendered.\r\nThis was the end. Philip was induced to surrender on promise of favourable\r\ntreatment, made by the Electors who had remained on the Emperor’s side.\r\nCharles refused to be bound by the promise made in his name, and the\r\nLandgrave was also held captive. All Germany, save Constance in the south\r\nand some of the Baltic lands, lay prostrate at the Emperor’s feet. It\r\nremained to be seen what use he would make of his victory.\r\n\r\nIn due time he set himself to bring about what he conceived to be a\r\nreasonable compromise which would enable all Germany to remain within one\r\nNational Church. He tried at first to induce the separate parties to work\r\nit out among themselves; and, when this was found to be hopeless, he, like\r\na second Justinian, resolved to construct a creed and to impose it by\r\nforce upon all, especially upon the Lutherans. To begin with, he had to\r\ndefy the Pope and slight the General Council for which he had been mainly\r\nresponsible. He formally demanded that the Council should return to German\r\nsoil (it had been transferred to Bologna), and, when this was refused, he\r\nprotested against its existence and, like the German Protestants he was\r\ncoercing, declared that he would not submit to its decrees. He next\r\nselected three theologians, Michael Helding, Julius von Pflug, and\r\nAgricola,—a mediævalist, an Erasmian, and a very conservative Lutheran—to\r\nconstruct what was called the _Augsburg Interim_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 14. The Augsburg Interim.(365)\r\n\r\n\r\nThis document taught the dogma of Transubstantiation, the seven\r\nSacraments, adoration of the Blessed Virgin and the Saints, retained most\r\nof the mediæval ceremonies and usages, and declared the Pope to be the\r\nHead of the Church. This was to please the Romanists. It appealed to the\r\nLutherans by adopting the doctrine of Justification by Faith in a modified\r\nform, the marriage of priests with some reservations, the use of the Cup\r\nby the laity in the Holy Supper, and by considerably modifying the\r\ndoctrine of the sacrificial character of the Mass. Of course all its\r\npropositions were ambiguous, and could be read in two ways. This was\r\nprobably the intention of the framers; if so, they were highly successful.\r\n\r\nNothing that Charles ever undertook proved such a dismal failure as this\r\npatchwork creed made from snippets from two Confessions. However lifeless\r\ncreeds may become, they all—real ones—have grown out of the living\r\nChristian experience of their framers, and have contained the very\r\nlife-blood of their hearts as well as of their brains. It is a hopeless\r\ntask to construct creeds as a tailor shapes and stitches coats.\r\n\r\nCharles, however, was proud of his creed, and did his best to enforce it.\r\nThe Diet of 1548 showed him his difficulties. The _Interim_ was accepted\r\nand proclaimed as an edict by this Diet (May 15), but only after the\r\nEmperor, very unwillingly, declared practically that it was meant for the\r\nProtestants alone. “The Emperor,” said a member of the Diet, “is fighting\r\nfor religion against the Pope, whom he acknowledges to be its head, and\r\nagainst the two parts of Christendom in Germany—the mass of the\r\nProtestants and the ecclesiastical princes.” Thus from the beginning what\r\nwas to be an instrument to unite German Christendom was transformed into a\r\n“strait-waistcoat for the Lutherans”; and this did not make it more\r\npalatable for them. At first the strong measures taken by the Emperor\r\ncompelled its nominal acceptance by many of the Protestant princes.(366)\r\nThe cities which seemed to be most refractory had their Councils purged of\r\ntheir democratic members, and their Lutheran preachers sent into\r\nbanishment—Matthew Alber from Reutlingen, Wolfgang Musculus from Augsburg,\r\nBrenz from Hall, Osiander from Nürnberg, Schnepf from Tübingen. Bucer and\r\nFagius had to flee from Strassburg and take refuge in England. The city of\r\nConstance was besieged and fell after a heroic defence; it was deprived of\r\nits privileges as an imperial city, and was added to the family\r\npossessions of the House of Austria. Its pastor, Blarer, was sent into\r\nbanishment. Four hundred Lutheran divines were driven from their homes.\r\n\r\nIf Charles, backed by his Spanish and Italian troops, could secure a\r\nnominal submission to his _Interim_, he could not coerce the people into\r\naccepting it. The churches stood empty in Augsburg, in Ulm, and in other\r\ncities. The people met it by an almost universal passive resistance—if\r\nsinging doggerel verses in mockery of the _Interim_ may be called passive.\r\nWhen the Emperor ordered Duke Christopher of Würtemberg to drive Brenz out\r\nof his refuge in his State, the Duke answered him that he could not banish\r\nhis whole population. The popular feeling, as is usual in such cases,\r\nfound vent in all manner of satirical songs, pamphlets, and even\r\ncatechisms. As in the times before the Peasants’ War, this coarse popular\r\nliterature had an immense circulation. Much of it took the form of rude\r\nbroadsides with a picture, generally satirical, at the top, and the song,\r\nsometimes with the music score, printed below.(367) Wandering preachers,\r\nwhom no amount of police supervision could check, went inveighing against\r\nthe _Interim_, distributing the rude literature through the villages and\r\namong the democracy in the towns. Soon the creed and the edict which\r\nenforced it became practically a dead letter throughout the greater part\r\nof Germany.\r\n\r\nThe presence of the Emperor’s Spanish troops on the soil of the Fatherland\r\nirritated the feelings of Germans, whether Romanists or Protestants; the\r\ninsolence and excesses of these soldiers stung the common people; and\r\ntheir employment to enforce the hated _Interim_ on the Protestants was an\r\nadditional insult. The citizens of one imperial city were told that if\r\nthey did not accept the _Interim_ they must be taught theology by Spanish\r\ntroops, and of another that they would yet learn to speak the language of\r\nSpain. While the popular odium against Charles was slowly growing in\r\nintensity, he contrived to increase it by a proposal that his son Philip\r\nshould have the imperial crown after his brother Ferdinand. Charles’ own\r\nelection had been caused by a patriotic sentiment. The people thought that\r\na German was better than a Frenchman, and they had found out too late that\r\nthey had not got a German but a Spaniard. Ferdinand had lived in Germany\r\nlong enough to know its wants, and his son Maximilian had shown that he\r\npossessed many qualities which appealed to the German character. The\r\nproposal to substitute Philip, however natural from Charles’ point of\r\nview, and consistent with his earlier idea that the House of Hapsburg\r\nshould have one head, meant to the Germans to still further “hispaniolate”\r\nGermany. This unpopularity of Charles among all ranks and classes of\r\nGermans grew rapidly between 1548 and 1552; and during the same years his\r\nforeign prestige was fast waning. He remained in Germany, with the\r\nexception of a short visit to the Netherlands; but in spite of his\r\npresence the anarchy grew worse and worse. The revolt which came might\r\nhave arisen much sooner had the Protestants been able to overcome their\r\nhatred and suspicion of Maurice of Saxony, whose co-operation was almost\r\nessential. It is unnecessary to describe the intrigues which went on\r\naround the Emperor, careless though not unforewarned.\r\n\r\nMaurice had completed his arrangements with his German allies and with\r\nFrance early in 1552. The Emperor had retired from Augsburg to Innsbruck.\r\nMaurice seized the Pass of Ehrenberg on the nights of May 18th, 19th, and\r\npressed on to Innsbruck, hoping to “run the old fox to earth.” Charles\r\nescaped by a few hours, and, accompanied by his brother Ferdinand, fled\r\nover the Brenner Pass amid a storm of snow and rain. It was the road by\r\nwhich he had entered Germany in fair spring weather when he came in 1530,\r\nin the zenith of his power, to settle, as he had confidently expected, the\r\nreligious difficulties in Germany. He reached Villach in Carinthia in\r\nsafety, and there waited the issue of events.\r\n\r\nThe German princes gathered in great numbers at Passau (Aug. 1552) to\r\ndiscuss the position and arrive at a settlement. Maurice was ostensibly\r\nthe master of the situation, for his troops and those of his wild ally\r\nAlbert Alcibiades of Brandenburg-Culmbach were in the town, and many a\r\nprince felt “as if they had a hare in their breast.” His demands for the\r\npublic good were moderate and statesmanlike. He asked for the immediate\r\nrelease of his father-in-law the Landgrave of Hesse; for a settlement of\r\nthe religious question on a basis that would be permanent, at a meeting of\r\nGerman princes fairly representative of the two parties—no Council\r\nsummoned and directed by the Pope would ever give fair-play to the\r\nProtestants, he said, nor could they expect to get it from the Diet where\r\nthe large number of ecclesiastical members gave an undue preponderance to\r\nthe Romanist side; and for a settlement of some constitutional questions.\r\nThe princes present, and with them Ferdinand, King of the Romans, were\r\ninclined to accept these demands. But when they were referred to Charles\r\nat Villach, he absolutely refused to permit the religious or the\r\nconstitutional question to be settled by any assembly but the Diet of the\r\nEmpire. Nothing would move him from his opinion, neither the entreaties of\r\nhis brother nor his own personal danger. He still counted on the divisions\r\namong the Protestants, and believed that he had only to support the “born\r\nElector” of Saxony against the one of his own creation to deprive Maurice\r\nof his strength. It may be that Maurice had his own fears, it may be that\r\nhe was glad to have the opportunity of showing that the “Spaniard” was the\r\none enemy to a lasting peace in Germany. He contented himself with the\r\nacquiescence of John Frederick in the permanent loss of the Electorate as\r\narranged at the Peace of Wittenberg (1547).\r\n\r\nCharles was then free to come back to Augsburg, where he had the petty\r\nsatisfaction of threatening the Lutheran preachers who had returned, and\r\nof again overthrowing the democratic government of the city. He then went\r\nto assume the command of the German army which was opposing the French.\r\nHis failure to take the city of Metz was followed by his practical\r\nabandonment of the direction of the affairs of Germany, which were left in\r\nthe hands of Ferdinand. The disorders of the time delayed the meeting of\r\nthe Diet until 1555 (opened Feb. 5th). The Elector and the “born Elector”\r\nof Saxony were both dead—John Frederick, worn out by misfortune and\r\nimprisonment (March 3rd, 1554), and sympathised with by friends and foes\r\nalike; and Maurice, only thirty-two years of age, killed in the moment of\r\nvictory at Sievershausen (July 9th, 1553).\r\n\r\nIt was in the summer of 1554 that the Emperor had handed over, in a\r\ncarefully limited manner, the management of German affairs to his brother\r\nFerdinand, the King of the Romans. The terms of devolution of authority\r\nimply that this was done by Charles to avoid the humiliation of being\r\npersonally responsible for acquiescence in what was to him a hateful\r\nnecessity, and the confession of failure in his management of Germany from\r\n1530. Everyone recognised that peace was necessary at almost any price,\r\nbut Ferdinand and the higher ecclesiastical princes shrunk from facing the\r\ninevitable. The King of the Romans still cherished some vague hopes of a\r\ncompromise which would preserve the unity of the mediæval German Church,\r\nand the selfish policy of many of the Protestant princes encouraged him.\r\nElector Joachim of Brandenburg wished the archbishopric of Magdeburg and\r\nthe bishopric of Halberstadt for his son Sigismund, and declared that he\r\nwould be content with the _Interim_! Christopher of Würtemberg cherished\r\nsimilar designs on ecclesiastical properties. Augustus of Saxony,\r\nMaurice’s brother and successor, wished the bishopric of Meissen. All\r\nthese designs could be more easily fulfilled if the external unity of the\r\nmediæval Church remained unbroken.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 15. Religious Peace of Augsburg.(368)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Diet had been summoned for Nov. 13th (1554), but when Ferdinand\r\nreached Augsburg about the end of the year, the Estates had not gathered.\r\nHe was able to open the Diet formally on Feb. 5th (1555), but none of the\r\nElectors, and only two of the great ecclesiastical princes, the Cardinal\r\nBishop of Augsburg and the Bishop of Eichstadt, were present in person.\r\nWhile the Diet dragged on aimlessly, the Protestant princes gathered to a\r\ngreat Council of their own at Naumburg (March 3rd, 1555) to concert a\r\ncommon policy. Among those present were the Electors of Brandenburg and\r\nSaxony, the sons of John Frederick, the ill-fated “born Elector,” and the\r\nLandgrave of Hesse—sixteen princes and a great number of magnates. After\r\nlong debates, the assembly decided (March 13th) that they would stand by\r\nthe Augsburg Confession of 1530, and that the minority would unite with\r\nthe majority in carrying out one common policy. Even “fat old Interim,” as\r\nElector Joachim of Brandenburg had been nicknamed, was compelled to\r\nsubmit; and the Protestants stood on a firm basis with a definite\r\nprogramme, and pledged to support each other.\r\n\r\nThis memorable meeting at Naumburg forced the hands of the members of the\r\nDiet. Every member, save the Cardinal Bishop of Augsburg, desired a\r\n_permanent_ settlement of the religious question, and their zeal appeared\r\nin the multiplicity of adjectives used to express the predominant\r\nthought—“_beständiger, beharrlicher, unbedingter, für und für ewig\r\nwährender_” was the phrase. The meeting at Naumburg showed them that this\r\ncould not be secured without the recognition of Lutheranism as a legal\r\nreligion within the German Empire.\r\n\r\nWhen the Protestant demands were formally placed before the Diet, they\r\nwere found to include—security under the Public Law of the Empire for all\r\nwho professed the Augsburg Confession, and for all who in future might\r\nmake the same profession; liberty to hold legally all the ecclesiastical\r\nproperty which had been or might in the future be secularised; complete\r\ntoleration for all Lutherans who were resident in Romanist States without\r\ncorresponding toleration for Romanists in Lutheran States. These demands\r\nwent much further than any which Luther himself had formulated, and really\r\napplied to Romanists some of the provisions of the “recess” of Speyer\r\n(1529) which, when applied to Lutherans, had called forth the Protest.\r\nThey were vehemently objected to by the Romanist members of the Diet; and,\r\nas both parties seemed unwilling to yield anything to the other, there was\r\nsome danger of the religious war breaking out again. The mediation of\r\nFerdinand for the Romanists and Frederick of Saxony for the Protestants\r\nbrought a compromise after months of debate. It was agreed that the\r\nLutheran religion should be legalised within the Empire, and that all\r\nLutheran princes should have full security for the practice of their\r\nfaith; that the mediæval episcopal jurisdiction should cease within their\r\nlands; and that they were to retain all ecclesiastical possessions which\r\nhad been secularised before the passing of the Treaty of Passau (1552).\r\nFuture changes of faith were to be determined by the principle _cujus\r\nregio ejus religio_. The secular territorial ruler might choose between\r\nthe Romanist or the Lutheran faith, and his decision was to bind all his\r\nsubjects. If a subject professed another religion from his prince, he was\r\nto be allowed to emigrate without molestation. These provisions were\r\nagreed upon by all, and embodied in the “recess.” Two very important\r\nmatters remained unsettled. The Romanists demanded that any ecclesiastical\r\nprince who changed his faith should thereby forfeit lands and\r\ndignities—the “ecclesiastical reservation.” This was embodied in the\r\n“recess,” but the Protestants declared that they would not be bound by it.\r\nOn the other hand, the Protestants demanded toleration for all Lutherans\r\nliving within the territories of Romanist princes. This was not embodied\r\nin the “recess,” though Ferdinand promised that he would see it carried\r\nout in practice.(369) Such was the famous Peace of Augsburg. There was no\r\nreason why it should not have come years earlier and without the wild\r\nwar-storm which preceded it, save the fact that, in an unfortunate fit of\r\nenthusiasm, the Germans had elected the young King of Spain to be their\r\nEmperor. They had chosen the grandson of the genial Maxmilian, believing\r\nhim to be a real German, and they got a man whose attitude to religion\r\n“was half-way between the genial orthodoxy of his grandfather Maxmilian\r\nand the gloomy fanaticism of his son Philip II.,” and whose “mind was\r\nalways travelling away from the former and towards the latter\r\nposition.”(370) The longer he lived the more Spanish he became, and the\r\nless capable of understanding Germany, either on its secular or religious\r\nside. His whole public life, so far as that country was concerned, was one\r\ndisastrous failure. He succeeded only when he used his imperial position\r\nto increase and consolidate the territorial possessions of the House of\r\nHapsburg; for the charge of dismembering the Empire can be brought home to\r\nCharles as effectually as to the most selfish of the princes of Germany.\r\n\r\nThe Religious Peace of Augsburg was contained in the decisions of Speyer\r\nin 1526, and it was repeated in every one of the truces which the Emperor\r\nmade with his Lutheran subjects from 1530 to 1544.(371) Had any one of\r\nthese been made permanent, the religious war, with its outcome in wild\r\nanarchy, in embittered religious antagonisms, and its seed of internecine\r\nstrife, to be reaped in the Thirty Years’ War, would never have occurred.\r\nBut Charles, whose mission, he fancied, was to preserve the unity “of the\r\nseamless robe of Christ,” as he phrased it, could only make the attempt by\r\ndrenching the fields of Germany with blood, and perpetuating and\r\naccentuating the religious antagonisms of the country which had chosen him\r\nfor its Protector.\r\n\r\nThis Religious Peace of Augsburg has been claimed, and rightly, as a\r\nvictory for religious liberty.\r\n\r\nFrom one point of view the victory was not a great one. The only\r\nConfession tolerated was the Augsburg. The Swiss Reformation and its\r\nadherents were outside the scope of the religious peace. What grew to be\r\nthe Reformed or Calvinistic Church was also outside. It was limited solely\r\nto the Lutheran, or, as it was called, the Evangelical creed. Nor was\r\nthere much gain to the personal liberty of conscience. It may be said with\r\ntruth that there was less freedom of conscience under the Lutheran\r\nterritorial system of Churches, and also under the Roman Catholic Church\r\nreorganised under the canons and decrees of Trent, than there was in the\r\nmediæval Church.\r\n\r\nThe victory lay in this, that the first blow had been struck to free\r\nmankind from the fetters of Romanist absolutism; that the first faltering\r\nstep had been taken on the road to religious liberty; and the first is\r\nvaluable not for what it is in itself, but for what it represents and for\r\nwhat comes after it. The Religious Peace of Augsburg did not concede much\r\naccording to modern standards; but it contained the potency and promise of\r\nthe future. It is always the first step which counts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter VI. The Organisation Of Lutheran Churches.(372)\r\n\r\n\r\nTwo conceptions, the second being derived from the first, lay at the basis\r\nof everything which Luther said or did about the organisation of the\r\nChristian fellowship into churches.\r\n\r\nThe primary and cardinal doctrine, which was the foundation of everything,\r\nwas the spiritual priesthood of all believers. This, he believed, implied\r\nthat preaching, dispensing the sacraments, ecclesiastical discipline, and\r\nso forth were not the exclusive possession of a special caste of men to\r\nwhom they had been committed by God, and who therefore were mediators\r\nbetween God and man. These divine duties belonged to the whole community\r\nas a fellowship of believing men and women; but as a division of labour\r\nwas necessary, and as each individual Christian cannot undertake such\r\nduties without disorder ensuing, the community must seek out and set apart\r\ncertain of its members to perform them in its name.\r\n\r\nThe second conception was that secular government is an ordinance ordained\r\nof God, and that the special rule claimed by the Roman Pontiff over things\r\nsecular and sacred was a usurpation of the powers committed by God to the\r\nsecular authority. This Luther understood to mean that the Christian\r\nmagistracy might well represent the Christian community of believers, and,\r\nin its name or associated with it, undertake the organisation and\r\nsuperintendence of the Church civic or territorial.\r\n\r\nIn his earlier writings, penned before the outbreak of the Peasants’ War,\r\nLuther dwells most on the thought of the community of believers, their\r\nrights and powers; in the later ones, when the fear of the common man had\r\ntaken possession of him, the secular authority occupies his whole field of\r\nthought. But although, before the Peasants’ War, Luther does not give such\r\na fixed place to the secular magistracy as the one source of authority or\r\nsupervision over the Church, the conception was in his mind from the\r\nfirst.\r\n\r\nAmong the various duties which belong to the company of believers, Luther\r\nselected three as the most outstanding,—those connected with the\r\npastorate, including preaching, dispensing the sacraments, and so forth;\r\nthe service of Christian charity; and the duty of seeing that the children\r\nbelonging to the community, and especially “poor, miserable, and deserted\r\nchildren,” were properly educated and trained to become useful members of\r\nthe commonwealth.\r\n\r\nIn the few instances of attempts made before the Peasants’ War to\r\nformulate those conceptions into regulations for communities organised\r\naccording to evangelical principles, we find the community and the\r\nmagistracy combining to look after the public worship, the poor, and\r\neducation. Illustrations may be seen in the Wittenberg ordinance of 1522\r\n(Carlstadt), and the ordinances of Leisnig (1523) and Magdeburg\r\n(1524).(373) All three are examples of the local authority within a small\r\ncommunity endeavouring, at the prompting of preachers and people, to\r\nexpress in definite regulations some of the demands of the new evangelical\r\nlife.\r\n\r\nLuther himself thought these earlier regulations premature, and insisted\r\nthat the Wittenberg ordinance should be cancelled. He knew that changes\r\nmust come; but he hoped to see them make their way gradually, almost\r\nimperceptibly, commending themselves to everyone without special enactment\r\nprescribed by external authority. He published suggestions for the\r\ndispensation of the Lord’s Supper and of Baptism in the churches in\r\nWittenberg as early as 1523; he collected and issued a small selection of\r\nevangelical hymns which _might_ be sung in Public Worship (1524); during\r\nthe same year he addressed the burgomasters and councillors of all German\r\ntowns on the erection and maintenance of Christian schools; and he\r\ncongratulated more than one municipality on provisions made for the care\r\nof the poor.(374) Above all, he had, while in Wartburg, completed a\r\ntranslation of the New Testament which, after revision by Melanchthon and\r\nother friends, was published in 1522 (Sept. 21st), and went through\r\nsixteen revised editions and more than fifty reimpressions before 1534.\r\nThe translation of the Old Testament was made by a band of scholars at\r\nWittenberg, published in instalments, and finally in complete form in\r\n1534.\r\n\r\nHe always cherished the hope that the evangelical faith would spread\r\nquietly all over his dear Fatherland if only room were made for the\r\npreaching of the gospel. This of itself, he thought, would in due time\r\neffect a peaceful transformation of the ecclesiastical life and worship.\r\nThe Diets of Nürnberg and Speyer had provided a field, always growing\r\nwider, for this quiet transformation. Luther was as indifferent to forms\r\nof Church government as John Wesley, and, like Wesley, every step he took\r\nin providing for a separate organisation was forced upon him as a\r\npractical necessity. To the very last he cherished the hope that there\r\nmight be no need for any great change in the external government of the\r\nChurch. The Augsburg Confession itself (1530) concludes with the words.\r\n“Our meaning is not to have rule taken from the bishops; but this one\r\nthing only is requested at their hands, that they would suffer the gospel\r\nto be purely taught, and that they would relax a few observances, which\r\ncannot be held without sin. But if they will remit none, let them look how\r\nthey will give account to God for this, that by their obstinacy they\r\nafford cause of division and schism, which it were yet fit they should aid\r\nin avoiding.”(375) It was not that he believed that the existence of the\r\nvisible Catholic Church depended on what has been ambiguously called an\r\napostolic succession of bishops, who, through gifts conferred in\r\nordination, create priests, who in turn make Christians out of natural\r\nheathen by the sacraments. He did not believe that ordination needed a\r\nbishop to confer it; he made his position clear upon this point as early\r\nas 1525, and ordination was practised without bishops from that date. But\r\nhe had no desire to make changes for the sake of change. The Danish Church\r\nis at once episcopal and Lutheran to this day.\r\n\r\nIt ought also to be remembered that Luther and all the Reformers believed\r\nand held firmly the doctrine of a visible Catholic Church of Christ, and\r\nthat the evangelical movement which they headed was the outcome of the\r\ncenturies of saintly life _within_ that visible Catholic Church. They\r\nnever for a moment supposed that in withdrawing themselves from the\r\nauthority of the Bishop of Rome they were separating themselves from the\r\nvisible Church. Nor did they imagine that in making provision, temporary\r\nor permanent, for preaching the word, the dispensation of the sacraments,\r\nthe exercise of discipline, and so forth, they were founding a new Church,\r\nor severing themselves from that visible Church within which they had been\r\nbaptized. They refused to concede the term _Catholic_ to their opponents,\r\nand in the various conferences which they had with them, the Roman\r\nCatholics were always _officially_ designated “the adherents of the old\r\nreligion,” while they were termed “the associates of the Augsburg\r\nConfession.”\r\n\r\nLuther cherished the hope, as late as 1545, that there might not need to\r\nbe a permanent change in the external form of the Church in Germany; and\r\nthis gives all the earlier schemes for the organisation of communities\r\nprofessing the evangelical faith somewhat of a makeshift and temporary\r\nappearance, which they in truth possessed.\r\n\r\nThe Diet of Speyer of 1526 gave the evangelical princes and towns the\r\nright, they believed, to reorganise public worship and ecclesiastical\r\norganisation within their dominions, and this right was largely taken\r\nadvantage of. Correspondents from all quarters asked Luther’s advice and\r\nco-operation, and we can learn from his answers that he was anxious there\r\nshould be as much local freedom as possible,—that communities should try\r\nto find out what suited them best, and that the “use” of Wittenberg should\r\nnot be held to regulate the custom of all other places.\r\n\r\nIt was less difficult for the authorities in the towns to take over the\r\ncharge of the ecclesiastical arrangements. They had during mediæval times\r\nsome experience in the matter; and city life was so compact that it was\r\neasy to regulate the ecclesiastical portion. The prevailing type exhibited\r\nin the number of “ordinances” which have come down to us, collected by\r\nRichter and Sehling, is that a superintendent, one of the city clergy, was\r\nplaced over the city churches, and that he was more or less responsible to\r\nthe city fathers for the ecclesiastical life and rule within the domains\r\nof the city.\r\n\r\nThe ecclesiastical organisation of the territories of the princes was a\r\nmuch more difficult task. Luther proposed to the Elector of Saxony that a\r\ncareful visitation of his principality should be made, district by\r\ndistrict, in order to find out the state of matters and what required to\r\nbe done.\r\n\r\nThe correspondence of Luther during the years 1525-1527 shows how urgent\r\nthe need of such a visitation appeared to him. He had been through the\r\ncountry several times. Parish priests had laid their difficulties before\r\nhim and had asked his advice. His letters describe graphically their\r\nabounding poverty, a poverty increased by the fact that the only\r\napplication of the new evangelical liberty made by many of the people was\r\nto refuse to pay all clerical dues. He came to the conclusion that the\r\n“common man” respected neither priest nor preacher, that there was no\r\necclesiastical supervision in the country districts, and no exercise of\r\nauthority to maintain even the necessary ecclesiastical buildings. He\r\nexpressed the fear that if things were allowed to go on as they were\r\ndoing, there would be soon neither priest’s house nor schools nor scholars\r\nin many a parish. The reports of the first Saxon Visitation showed that\r\nLuther had not exaggerated matters.(376) The district about Wittenberg was\r\nin much better order than the others; but in the outlying portions a very\r\nbad state of things was disclosed. In a village near Torgau the Visitors\r\ndiscovered an old priest who was hardly able to repeat the Creed or the\r\nLord’s Prayer,(377) but who was held in high esteem as an exorcist, and\r\nwho derived a good income from the exercise of his skill in combating the\r\nevil influences of witches. Priests had to be evicted for gross\r\nimmoralities. Some were tavern-keepers or practised other worldly\r\ncallings. Village schools were rarely to be found. Some of the peasants\r\ncomplained that the Lord’s Prayer was so long that they could not learn\r\nit; and in one place the Visitors found that not a single peasant knew any\r\nprayer whatsoever.\r\n\r\nThis Saxon Visitation was the model for similar ones made in almost every\r\nevangelical principality, and its reports serve to show what need there\r\nwas for inquiry and reorganisation. The lands of Electoral Saxony were\r\ndivided into four “circles,” and a commission of theologians and lawyers\r\nwas appointed to undertake the duties in each circle. The Visitation of\r\nthe one “circle” of Wittenberg, with its thirty-eight parishes, may be\r\ntaken as an example of how the work was done, and what kinds of\r\nalterations were suggested. The commissioners or Visitors were Martin\r\nLuther and Justus Jonas, theologians, with Hans Metzsch, Benedict Pauli,\r\nand Johann v. Taubenheim, jurists. They began in October 1528, and spent\r\ntwo months over their task. It was a strictly business proceeding. There\r\nis no account of either Luther or Jonas preaching while on tour. The\r\nVisitors went about their work with great energy, holding conferences with\r\nthe parish priests and with the representatives of the community. They\r\nquestioned the priests about the religious condition of the people—whether\r\nthere was any gross and open immorality, whether the people were regular\r\nin their attendance at church and in coining to the communion. They asked\r\nthe people how the priests did their work among them—in the towns their\r\nconferences were with the _Rath_, and in the country districts and\r\nvillages with the male heads of families. Their common work was to find\r\nout what was being done for the “cure of souls,” the instruction of the\r\nyouth, and the care of the poor. By “cure of souls” (_Seelsorge_) they\r\nmeant preaching, dispensation of the sacraments, catechetical instruction,\r\nand the pastoral visitation of the sick. It belonged to the theologians to\r\nestimate the capacities of the pastors, and to the jurists to estimate the\r\navailable income, to look into all legal difficulties that might arise,\r\nand especially to clear the entanglements caused by the supposed\r\njurisdiction of convents over many of the parishes.\r\n\r\nThis small district was made up of three outlying portions of the three\r\ndioceses of Brandenburg, Magdeburg, and Meissen. It had not been inspected\r\nwithin the memory of man, and the results of episcopal negligence were\r\nmanifest. At Klebitz the peasants had driven away the parish clerk and put\r\nthe village herd in his house. At Bülzig there was neither parsonage nor\r\nhouse for parish clerk, and the priest was non-resident. So at Danna;\r\nwhere the priest held a benefice at Coswig, and was, besides, a chaplain\r\nat Wittenberg, while the clerk lived at Zahna. The parsonages were all in\r\na bad state of repair, and the local authorities could not be got to do\r\nanything. Roofs were leaking, walls were crumbling, it was believed that\r\nthe next winter’s frost would bring some down bodily. At Pratau the priest\r\nhad built all himself—parsonage, out-houses, stable, and byre. All these\r\nthings were duly noted to be reported upon. As for the priests, the\r\ncomplaints made against them were very few indeed. In one case the people\r\nsaid that their priest drank, and was continually seen in the\r\npublic-house. Generally, however, the complaints, when there were any,\r\nwere that the priest was too old for his work, or was so utterly\r\nuneducated that he could do little more than mumble the Mass. There was\r\nscanty evidence that the people understood very clearly the evangelical\r\ntheology. Partaking the Lord’s Supper in both “kinds,” or in one only, was\r\nthe distinction recognised and appreciated between the new and the old\r\nteaching; and when they had the choice the people universally preferred\r\nthe new. In one case the parishioners complained that their priest\r\ninsisted on saying the Mass in Latin and not in German. In one case only\r\ndid the Visitors find any objection taken to the evangelical service. This\r\nwas at Meure, where the parish clerk’s wife was reported to be an enemy of\r\nthe new pastor because he recited the service in German. It turned out,\r\nhowever, that her real objection was that the pastor had displaced her\r\nhusband. At Bleddin the peasants told the Visitors that their pastor,\r\nChristopher Richter, was a learned and pious man, who preached regularly\r\non all the Sundays and festival days, and generally four times a week in\r\nvarious parts of the parish. It appeared, however, that their admiration\r\nfor him did not compel them to attend his ministrations with very great\r\nregularity. The energetic pastors were all young men trained at\r\nWittenberg. The older men, peasants’ sons all of them, were scarcely\r\nbetter educated than their parishioners, and were quite unable to preach\r\nto them. The Visitors found very few parishes indeed where three, four,\r\nfive or more persons were not named to them who never attended church or\r\ncame to the Lord’s Table; in some parishes men came regularly to the\r\npreaching who never would come to the Sacrament. What impressed the\r\nVisitors most was the ignorance, the besotted ignorance, of the people.\r\nThey questioned them directly; found out whether they knew the Apostles’\r\nCreed, the Ten Commandments, and the Lord’s Prayer; and then questioned\r\nthem about the meanings of the words; and the answers were disappointing.\r\n\r\nLuther came back from the Visitation in greatly depressed spirits, and\r\nexpressed his feelings in his usual energetic language. He says in his\r\nintroduction to his _Small Catechism_, a work he began as soon as he\r\nreturned from the Visitation:\r\n\r\n\r\n    “In setting forth this Catechism or Christian doctrine in such a\r\n    simple, concise, and easy form, I have been compelled and driven\r\n    by the wretched and lamentable state of affairs which I discovered\r\n    lately when I acted as a Visitor. Merciful God, what misery have I\r\n    seen, the common people knowing nothing at all of Christian\r\n    doctrine, especially in the villages! and unfortunately many\r\n    pastors are well-nigh unskilled and incapable of teaching; and\r\n    although all are called Christians and partake of the Holy\r\n    Sacrament, they know neither the Lord’s Prayer, nor the Creed, nor\r\n    the Ten Commandments, but live like poor cattle and senseless\r\n    swine, though, now that the gospel is come, they have learnt well\r\n    enough how they may abuse their liberty. Oh, ye bishops, how will\r\n    ye ever answer for it to Christ that ye have so shamefully\r\n    neglected the people, and have not attended for an instant to your\r\n    office? May all evil be averted from you! (_Das euch alles unglück\r\n    fliche_). Ye forbid the taking of the Sacrament in one kind, and\r\n    insist on your human laws, but never inquire whether they know the\r\n    Lord’s Prayer, the Belief, the Ten Commandments, or any of the\r\n    words of God. Oh, woe be upon you for evermore!”\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Visitors found that few books were to be seen in the parsonages. They\r\nrecord one notable exception, the parsonage of Schmiedeberg, where the\r\npriest had a library of twelve volumes. It could not be expected that such\r\nuneducated men could preach to much edification; and one of the\r\nrecommendations of the Visitors was that copies of Luther’s _Postils_ or\r\nshort sermons on the Lessons for the Day should be sent to all the\r\nparishes, with orders that they should be read by the pastors to their\r\ncongregations.\r\n\r\nThey did not find a trace anywhere of systematic pastoral visitation or\r\ncatechising.\r\n\r\nIn their practical suggestions for ending the priestly inefficiency, the\r\nVisitors made simple and homely arrangements. To take one example,—at\r\nLiessnitz, the aged pastor Conrad was quite unable from age and ignorance\r\nto perform his duties; but he was a good, inoffensive old man. It was\r\narranged that he was to have a coadjutor, who was to be boarded by the\r\nrich man of the parish and get the fees, while the old pastor kept the\r\nparsonage and the stipend, out of which he was to pay fourteen gulden\r\nannually to his coadjutor.\r\n\r\nThe Visitors found that schools did not exist in most of the villages, and\r\nthey were disappointed with the condition of the schools they found in the\r\nsmaller towns. It was proposed to make the parish clerks the village\r\nschoolmasters; but they were wholly incompetent, and the Visitors saw\r\nnothing for it but to suggest that the pastors must become the village\r\nschoolmasters. The parish clerks were ordered to teach the children to\r\nrepeat the _Small Catechism_ by rote, and the pastors to test them at a\r\ncatechising on Sunday afternoons. In the towns, where the churches usually\r\nhad a _cantor_ or precentor, this official was asked to train the children\r\nto sing evangelical hymns.\r\n\r\nIn their inquiries about the care of the poor, the Visitors found that\r\nthere was not much need for anything to be done in the villages; but the\r\ncase was different in the towns. They found that in most of them there\r\nexisted old foundations meant to benefit the poor, and they discovered all\r\nmanner of misuses and misappropriations of the funds. Suggestions were\r\nmade for the restoration of these funds to their destined uses.\r\n\r\nThis very condensed account of what took place in the Wittenberg “circle”\r\nshows how the work of the Visitors was done; a second and a third\r\nVisitation were needed in Electoral Saxony ere things were properly\r\narranged; but in the end good work was accomplished. The Elector refused\r\nto take any of the confiscated convent lands and possessions for civil\r\npurposes, and these, together with the Church endowments, provided\r\nstipends for the pastors, salaries for the schoolmasters, and a settled\r\nprovision for the poor.\r\n\r\nWhen the Visitation was completed and the reports presented, the Visitors\r\nwere asked to draft and issue an _Instruction_ or lengthy advice to the\r\nclergy and people of the “circle” they had inspected. This _Instruction_\r\nwas not considered a regular legal document, but its contents were\r\nexpected to be acted upon.\r\n\r\nThese Visitations and Instructions were the earliest attempts at the\r\nreorganisation of the evangelical Church in Electoral Saxony. The Visitors\r\nremained as a “primitive evangelical consistory” to supervise their\r\n“circles.”\r\n\r\nThe Saxon Visitations became a model for most of the North German\r\nevangelical territorial Churches, and the Instructions form the earliest\r\ncollection of requirements set forth for the guidance of pastors and\r\nChristian people. The directions are very minute. The pastors are told how\r\nto preach, how to conduct pastoral visitations, what sins they must\r\nspecially warn their people against, and what example they must show them.\r\nThe care of schools and of the poor was not forgotten.(378)\r\n\r\nThe fact that matrimonial cases were during the Middle Ages almost\r\ninvariably tried in ecclesiastical courts, made it necessary to provide\r\nsome legal authority to adjudicate upon such cases when the mediæval\r\nepiscopal courts had either temporarily or permanently lost their\r\nauthority. This led to a provisional arrangement for the government of the\r\nChurch in Electoral Saxony, which took a regular legal form. A pastor,\r\ncalled a superintendent, was appointed in each of the four “circles” into\r\nwhich the territory had been divided for the purpose of Visitation, to act\r\nalong with the ordinary magistracy in all ecclesiastical matters,\r\nincluding the judging in matrimonial cases.(379) This Saxon arrangement\r\nalso spread largely through the northern German evangelical States.\r\n\r\nA third Visitation of Electoral Saxony was made in 1532, and led to\r\nimportant ecclesiastical changes which formed the basis of all that came\r\nafterwards. As a result of the reports of the Visitors, of whom Justus\r\nJonas seems to have been the most energetic, the parishes were rearranged,\r\nthe incomes of parish priests readjusted, and the whole ecclesiastical\r\nrevenues of the mediæval Church within Electoral Saxony appropriated for\r\nthe threefold evangelical uses of supporting the ministry, providing for\r\nschools, and caring for the poor. The doctrine, ceremonies, and worship of\r\nthe evangelical Church were also settled on a definite basis.(380)\r\n\r\nThe Visitors pointed out that hitherto no arrangement had been made to\r\ngive the whole ecclesiastical administration one central authority. The\r\nElectoral Prince had always been regarded as the supreme ruler of the\r\nChurch within his dominions, but as he could not personally superintend\r\neverything, there was needed some supreme court which could act in all\r\necclesiastical cases as his representative or instrument. The Visitors\r\nsuggested the revival of the mediæval episcopal consistorial courts\r\nmodified to suit the new circumstances. Bishops in the mediæval sense of\r\nthe word might be and were believed to be superfluous, but their true\r\nfunction, the _jus episcopale_, the right of oversight, was indispensable.\r\nAccording to Luther’s ideas—ideas which had been gaining ground in Germany\r\nfrom the last quarter of the fifteenth century—this _jus episcopale_\r\nbelonged to the supreme secular authority. The mediæval bishop had\r\nexercised his right of oversight through a _consistorial court_ composed\r\nof theologians and canon lawyers appointed by himself. These mediæval\r\ncourts, it was suggested, might be transformed into Lutheran\r\necclesiastical courts if the prince formed a permanent council composed of\r\nlawyers and divines to act for him and in his name in all ecclesiastical\r\nmatters, including matrimonial cases. The Visitors sketched their plan; it\r\nwas submitted for revision to Luther and to Chancellor Brück, and the\r\nresult was the Wittenberg Ecclesiastical Consistory established in\r\n1542.(381) That the arrangement was still somewhat provisional appears\r\nfrom the fact that the court had not jurisdiction over the whole of the\r\nElectoral dominions, and that other two Consistories, one at Zeitz and the\r\nother at Zwickau, were established with similar powers. But the thing to\r\nbe observed is that these courts were modelled on the old mediæval\r\nconsistorial episcopal courts, and that, like them, they were composed of\r\nlawyers and of theologians. The essential difference was that these\r\nLutheran courts were appointed by and acted in the name of the supreme\r\nsecular authority. In Electoral Saxony their local bounds of jurisdiction\r\ndid not correspond to those of the mediæval courts. It was impossible that\r\nthey should. Electoral Saxony, the ordinance erecting the Consistory\r\nitself says, consisted of portions of “ten or twelve” mediæval dioceses.\r\nThe courts had different districts assigned to them; but in all other\r\nthings they reproduced the mediæval consistorial courts.\r\n\r\nThe constitutions of these courts provided for the assembling and holding\r\nof Synods to deliberate on the affairs of the Church. The General Synod\r\nconsisted of the Consistory and the superintendents of the various\r\n“circles”; and particular Synods, which had to do with the Church affairs\r\nof the “circle,” of the superintendent, and of all the clergy of the\r\n“circle.”\r\n\r\nSuch were the beginnings of the consistorial system of Church government,\r\nwhich is a distinctive mark of the Lutheran Church, and which exhibits\r\nsome of the individual traits of Luther’s personality. We can see in it\r\nhis desire to make full use of whatever portions of the mediæval Church\r\nusages could be pressed into the service of his evangelical Church; his\r\nconception that the one supreme authority on earth was that of the secular\r\ngovernment; his suspicion of the “common” man, and his resolve to prevent\r\nthe people exercising any control over the arrangements of the Church.\r\n\r\nGradually all the Lutheran Churches have adopted, in general outline at\r\nleast, this consistorial system; but it would be a mistake to think that\r\nthe Wittenberg “use” was adopted in all its details. Luther himself, as\r\nhas been said, had no desire for anything like uniformity, and there was\r\nnone in the beginning. All the schemes of ecclesiastical government\r\nproceed on the idea that the _jus episcopale_ or right of ecclesiastical\r\noversight belongs to the supreme territorial secular authority. All of\r\nthem include within the one set of ordinances, provisions for the support\r\nof the ministry, for the maintenance of schools, and for the care of the\r\npoor—the last generally expressed by regulations about the “common chest.”\r\nThe great variety of forms of ecclesiastical government drafted and\r\nadopted may be studied in Richter’s collection, which includes one hundred\r\nand seventy-two separate ecclesiastical constitutions, and which is\r\nconfessedly very imperfect. The gradual growth of the organisation finally\r\nadopted in each city and State can be traced for a portion of Germany in\r\nSehling’s unfinished work.(382)\r\n\r\nThe number of these ecclesiastical ordinances is enormous, and the\r\nquantity is to be accounted for partly by the way in which Germany was\r\nsplit up into numerous small States in the sixteenth century, and also\r\npartly by the fact that Luther pled strongly for diversity.\r\n\r\nThe ordinances were promulgated in many different ways. Most frequently,\r\nperhaps, the prince published and enacted them on his own authority like\r\nany other piece of territorial legislation. Sometimes he commissioned a\r\ncommittee acting in his name to frame and publish. In other cases they\r\nresulted from a consultation between the prince and the magistrates of one\r\nof the towns within his dominions. Sometimes they came from the councils\r\nand the pastors of the towns to which they applied. In other instances\r\nthey were issued by an evangelical bishop. And in a few cases they are\r\nsimply the regulations issued by a single pastor for his own parish, which\r\nthe secular authorities did not think of altering.\r\n\r\nAlthough they are independent one from another, they may be grouped in\r\nfamilies which resemble each other closely.(383)\r\n\r\nSome of the territories reached the consistorial system much sooner than\r\nothers. If a principality consisted in whole or in part of a secularised\r\necclesiastical State, the machinery of the consistorial court lay ready to\r\nthe hand of the prince, and was at once adapted to the use of the\r\nevangelical Church. The system was naturally slowest to develop in the\r\nimperial cities, most of which at first preferred an organisation whose\r\noutlines were borrowed from the constitution drafted by Zwingli for\r\nZurich.\r\n\r\nOnce only do we find an attempt to give an evangelical Church occupying a\r\nlarge territory a democratic constitution. It was made by Philip,\r\nLandgrave of Hesse, who was never afraid of the democracy. No German\r\nprince had so thoroughly won the confidence of his commonalty. The\r\nPeasants’ War never devastated his dominions. He did not join in the\r\nvirulent persecution of the Anabaptists which disgraced the Lutheran as\r\nwell as the Roman Catholic States during the latter half of the sixteenth\r\ncentury. It was natural that Luther’s earlier ideas about the rights of\r\nthe Christian community (_Gemeinde_) should appeal to him. In 1526 (Oct.\r\n6th), when the Diet of Speyer had permitted the organisation of\r\nevangelical Churches, Philip summoned a Synod at Homberg, and invited not\r\nmerely pastors and ecclesiastical lawyers, but representatives from the\r\nnobles and from the towns. A scheme for ecclesiastical government, which\r\nhad been drafted by Francis Lambert, formerly a Franciscan monk, was laid\r\nbefore the assembly and adopted. It was based on the idea that the word of\r\nGod is the only supreme rule to guide and govern His Church, and that\r\nCanon Law has no place whatsoever within an evangelical Church. Scripture\r\nteaches, the document explains, that it belongs to the Christian community\r\nitself to select and dismiss pastors and to exercise discipline by means\r\nof excommunication. The latter right ought to be used in a weekly meeting\r\n(on Sundays) of the congregation and pastor. For the purposes of orderly\r\nrule the Church must have office-bearers, who ought to conform as nearly\r\nas possible to those mentioned in the New Testament Scriptures. They are\r\nbishops (pastors), elders, and deacons; and the deacons are the guardians\r\nof the poor as well as ecclesiastical officials. All these office-bearers\r\nmust remember that their function is that of servants, and in no sense\r\nlordly or magisterial. They ought to be chosen by the congregation, and\r\nset apart by the laying on of hands according to apostolic practice. A\r\nbishop (pastor) must be ordained by at least three pastors, and a deacon\r\nby the pastor or by two elders. The government of the whole Church ought\r\nto be in the hands of a Synod, to consist of all the pastors and a\r\ndelegate from every parish. Such in outline was the democratic\r\necclesiastical government proposed for the territory of Hesse and accepted\r\nby the Landgrave.(384) He was persuaded, however, by Luther’s strong\r\nremonstrances to abandon it. There is no place for the democratic or\r\nrepresentative element in the organisation of the Lutheran Churches.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter VII. The Lutheran Reformation Outside Germany.(385)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe influence of Luther went far beyond Germany. It was felt in England,\r\nFrance, Scotland, Holland, Poland, and Scandinavia. England went her own\r\npeculiar way; France, Holland, and Scotland, in the end, accepted the\r\nleadership of Calvin; the Lutheran Reformation, outside Germany, was\r\nreally confined to Scandinavia alone.\r\n\r\nIn these Scandinavian lands the religious awakening was bound up with\r\npolitical and social movements more than in any other countries. The\r\nreformation in the Church was, indeed, begun by men who had studied under\r\nLuther at Wittenberg, or who had received their first promptings from his\r\nwritings; but it was carried on and brought to a successful issue by\r\nstatesmen who saw in it the means to deliver their land from political\r\nanarchy, caused by the overweening independence and turbulence of the\r\ngreat ecclesiastical lords, and who were almost compelled to look to the\r\nlarge possessions of the Church as a means to replenish their exhausted\r\ntreasuries without ruining the overburdened taxpayers.\r\n\r\nWhen Eric was crowned King of Denmark, Sweden, and Norway in 1397, the\r\nassembled nobles, representative of the three kingdoms, agreed to the\r\ncelebrated Union of Kalmar, which declared that the three lands were to be\r\nfor ever united under one sovereign. The treaty was purely dynastic, its\r\nterms were vague, and it was never very effective. Without going into\r\ndetails, it may be said that the king lived in Denmark, and ruled in the\r\ninterests of that country; that he also may be said to have ruled in\r\nNorway; but that in Sweden his authority was merely nominal, and sometimes\r\nnot even that. In Denmark itself, monarchical government was difficult.\r\nThe Scandinavian kingship was elective, and every election was an\r\nopportunity for reducing the privileges, authority, and wealth of the\r\nsovereign, and for increasing those of the nobles and of the great\r\necclesiastics, who, being privileged classes, were freed from contributing\r\nto the taxation.\r\n\r\nIn 1513, Christian II., the nephew of the Elector of Saxony, and the\r\nbrother-in-law of the Emperor Charles V. (1515), came to the throne, and\r\nhis accession marks the beginning of the new era which was to end with the\r\ntriumph of the Reformation in all three countries. Christian was a man of\r\ngreat natural abilities, with a profound sense of the miserable condition\r\nof the common people within his realms, caused by the petty tyrannies of\r\nthe nobles, ecclesiastical and secular. No reigning prince, save perhaps\r\nGeorge, Duke of Saxony, could compete with him in learning; but he was\r\ncruel, partly from nature and partly from policy. He had determined to\r\nestablish his rule over the three kingdoms whose nominal king he was, and\r\nto free the commonalty from their oppression by breaking the power of the\r\nnobles and of the great Churchmen. The task was one of extreme difficulty,\r\nand he was personally unsuccessful; but his efforts laid the foundation on\r\nwhich successors were able to build securely.\r\n\r\nHe began by conquering rebellious Sweden, and disgraced his victory by a\r\ntreacherous massacre of Swedish notables at Stockholm (1520),—a deed\r\nwhich, in the end, led to the complete separation of Sweden from Denmark.\r\nAfter having thus, as he imagined, consolidated his power, he pressed\r\nforward his schemes for reform. He took pains to encourage the trade and\r\nagriculture of Denmark; he patronised learning. He wrote to his uncle\r\n(1519), Frederick, the Elector of Saxony, to send him preachers trained by\r\nLuther; and, in response to his appeal, received first Martin Reinhard,\r\nand then Andrew Bodenstein of Carlstadt. These foreigners, who could only\r\naddress the people through interpreters, did not make much impression; but\r\nreformation was pushed forward by the king. He published, on his own\r\nauthority, two sets of laws dealing with the nobles and the Church, and\r\nsubjecting both to the sovereign. He enacted that all convents were to be\r\nunder episcopal inspection. Non-resident and unlettered clergy were\r\nlegally abolished. A species of kingly consistorial court was set up in\r\nCopenhagen, and declared to be the supreme ecclesiastical judicature for\r\nthe country; and appeals to Rome were forbidden. It can scarcely be said\r\nthat these laws were ever in operation. A revolt by the Jutlanders gave a\r\nrallying point to the disaffection caused by the proposed reforms.\r\nChristian fled from Denmark (1523), and spent the rest of his life in\r\nexile or in prison. His law-books were burnt.\r\n\r\nThe Jutlanders had called Frederick of Schleswig-Holstein, Christian’s\r\nuncle, to the throne, and he was recognised King of Denmark and of Norway\r\nin 1523. He had come to the kingdom owing to the reaction against the\r\nreforms of his nephew, but in his heart he knew that they were necessary.\r\nHe promised to protect the interests of the nobles, and to defend the\r\nChurch against the advance of Lutheran opinions; but he soon endeavoured\r\nto find a means of evading his pledges. He found it when he pitted the\r\nnobles against the higher clergy, and announced that he had never promised\r\nto support the errors of the Church of Rome. At the National Assembly\r\n(_Herredag_) at Odense he was able to get the marriage of priests\r\npermitted, and a decree that bishops were in the future to apply to the\r\nking and not to the Pope for their Pallium. The Reformation had now native\r\npreachers to support it, especially Hans Tausen, who was called the Danish\r\nLuther, and they were encouraged by the king. At the _Herredag_ at\r\nCopenhagen in 1530, twenty-one of these Lutheran preachers were summoned,\r\nat the instigation of the bishops, and formal accusations were made\r\nagainst them for preaching heresy. Tausen and his fellows produced a\r\nconfession of faith in forty-three articles, all of which he and his\r\ncompanions offered to defend. A public disputation was proposed, which did\r\nnot take place because the Romanist party refused to plead in the Danish\r\nlanguage. This refusal was interpreted by the people to mean that they\r\nwere afraid to discuss in a language which everyone understood.\r\nLutheranism made rapid progress among all classes of the population.\r\n\r\nOn Frederick’s death there was a disputed succession, which resulted in\r\ncivil war. In the end Frederick’s son ascended the throne as Christian\r\nIII., King of Denmark and Norway (1536). The king, who had been present at\r\nthe Diet of Worms, and who had learned there to esteem Luther highly, was\r\na strong Lutheran, and determined to end the authority of the Romish\r\nbishops. He proposed to his council that bishops should no longer have any\r\nshare in the government, and that their possessions should be forfeited to\r\nthe Crown. This was approved of not merely by the council, but also at a\r\nNational Assembly which met at Copenhagen (Oct. 30th, 1536), where it was\r\nfurther declared that the people desired the holy gospel to be preached,\r\nand the whole episcopal authority done away with. The king asked Luther to\r\nsend him some one to guide his people in their ecclesiastical matters.\r\nBugenhagen was despatched, came to Copenhagen (1537), and took the chief\r\necclesiastical part in crowning the king. Seven superintendents (who\r\nafterwards took the title of bishops) were appointed and consecrated. The\r\nReformation was carried out on conservative Lutheran lines, and the old\r\nritual was largely preserved. Tausen’s Confession was set aside in favour\r\nof the Augsburg Confession and Luther’s Small Catechism, and the Lutheran\r\nReformation was thoroughly and legally established.\r\n\r\nThe Reformation also became an accomplished fact in Norway and Iceland,\r\nbut its introduction into these lands was much more an act of kingly\r\nauthority.\r\n\r\nAfter the massacre of Swedish notables in Stockholm (Nov. 1520), young\r\nGustaf Ericsson, commonly known as Gustaf Vasa, from the _vasa_ or sheaf\r\nwhich was on his coat of arms, raised the standard of revolt against\r\nDenmark. He was gradually able to rally the whole of the people around\r\nhim, and the Danes were expelled from the kingdom. In 1521, Gustaf had\r\nbeen declared regent of Sweden, and in 1523 he was called by the voice of\r\nthe people to the throne. He found himself surrounded by almost\r\ninsuperable difficulties. There had been practically no settled government\r\nin Sweden for nearly a century, and every great landholder was virtually\r\nan independent sovereign. The country had been impoverished by long wars.\r\nTwo-thirds of the land was owned by the Church, and the remaining third\r\nwas almost entirely in the hands of the secular nobles. Both Church and\r\nnobles claimed exemption from taxation. The trade of the country was in\r\nthe hands of foreigners—of the Danes or of the Hanse Towns. Gustaf had\r\nborrowed money from the town of Lübeck for his work of liberation. The\r\ncity was pressing for repayment, and its commissioners followed the\r\nembarrassed monarch wherever he went. It was hopeless to expect to raise\r\nmoney by further taxation of the already depressed and impoverished\r\npeasants.\r\n\r\nIn these circumstances the king turned to the Church. He compelled the\r\nbishops to give him more than one subsidy (1522, 1523); but this was\r\ninadequate for his needs. The Church property was large, and the king\r\nplanned to overthrow the ecclesiastical aristocracy by the help of the\r\nLutheran Reformation.\r\n\r\nLutheranism had been making progress in Sweden. Two brothers, Olaus and\r\nLaurentius Petri, sons of a blacksmith at Orebro, had been sent by their\r\nfather to study in Germany. They had meant to attend the University of\r\nLeipzig; but, attracted by the growing fame of Luther, they had gone to\r\nWittenberg, and had become enthusiastic disciples of the Reformer. On\r\ntheir return to Sweden (1519) they had preached Lutheran doctrine, and had\r\nmade many converts—among others, Laurentius Andreæ, Archdeacon at\r\nStrengnäs. In spite of protests from the bishops, these three men were\r\nprotected by the king. Olaus Petri was especially active, and made long\r\npreaching tours, declaring that he taught the pure gospel which “Ansgar,\r\nthe apostle of the North, had preached seven hundred years before in\r\nSweden.”\r\n\r\nGustaf brought Olaus to Stockholm (1524), and made him town-clerk of the\r\ncity; his brother Laurentius was appointed professor of theology at\r\nUpsala; Laurentius Andrew was made Archdeacon of Upsala and Chancellor of\r\nSweden. When the bishops demanded that the Reformers should be silenced,\r\nOlaus challenged them to a public disputation. The challenge was refused;\r\nbut in 1524 a disputation was arranged in the king’s palace in Stockholm\r\nbetween Olaus and Dr. Galle, who supported the old religion. The\r\nconference, which included discussion of the doctrines of Justification by\r\nFaith, Indulgences, the Mass, Purgatory, and the Temporal Power of the\r\nPope, had the effect of strengthening the cause of the Reformation. In\r\n1525, Olaus defied the rules of the mediæval Church by publicly marrying a\r\nwife. The same year the king called for a translation of the Scriptures\r\ninto Swedish, and in 1526 Laurentius Petri published his New Testament. A\r\ntranslation of the whole Bible was edited by the same scholar, and\r\npublished 1540-1541. These translations, especially that of the New\r\nTestament, became very popular, and the people with the Scripture in their\r\nhands were able to see whether the teaching of the preachers or of the\r\nbishops was most in accordance with the Holy Scriptures.\r\n\r\nThere is no reason to believe that the king did not take the side of the\r\nLutheran Reformation from genuine conviction. He had made the acquaintance\r\nof the brothers Petri before he was called to be the deliverer of his\r\ncountry. But it is unquestionable that his financial embarrassment whetted\r\nhis zeal for the reformation of the Church in Sweden. Matters were coming\r\nto a crisis, which was reached in 1527. At the Diet in that year, the\r\nChancellor, in the name of the king, explained the need for an increased\r\nrevenue, and suggested that ecclesiastical property was the only source\r\nfrom which it could be obtained. The bishops, Johan Brask, Bishop of\r\nLinkoeping, at their head, replied that they had the Pope’s orders to\r\ndefend the property of the Church. The nobles supported them. Then Gustaf\r\npresented his ultimatum. He told the Diet plainly that they must submit to\r\nthe proposals of the Chancellor or accept his resignation, pay him for his\r\nproperty, return him the money he had spent in defence of the kingdom, and\r\npermit him to leave the country never to return. The Diet spent three days\r\nin wrangling, and then submitted to his wishes. The whole of the\r\necclesiastical property—episcopal, capitular, and monastic—which was not\r\nabsolutely needed for the support of the Church was to be placed in the\r\nhands of the king. Preachers were meanwhile to set forth the pure gospel,\r\nuntil a conference held in presence of the Diet would enable that assembly\r\nto come to a decision concerning matters of religion. The Diet went on,\r\nwithout waiting for the conference, to pass the twenty-four regulations\r\nwhich made the famous Ordinances of Vesteräs, and embodied the legal\r\nReformation. They contained provisions for secularising the ecclesiastical\r\nproperty in accordance with the previous decision of the Diet; declared\r\nthat the king had the right of vetoing the decisions of the higher\r\necclesiastics; that the appointment of the parish clergy was in the hands\r\nof the bishops, but that the king could remove them for inefficiency; that\r\nthe pure gospel was to be taught in every school; and that auricular\r\nconfession was no longer compulsory.\r\n\r\nWhile the Ordinances stripped the Swedish Church of a large amount of its\r\nproperty and made it subject to the king, they did not destroy its\r\nepiscopal organisation, nor entirely impoverish it. Most of the\r\nmonasteries were deserted when their property was taken away. The king\r\nknew that the peasantry scarcely understood the Reformed doctrines, and\r\nhad no wish to press them unduly on his people. For the same reason the\r\nold ceremonies and usages which did not flagrantly contradict the new\r\ndoctrines were suffered to remain, and given an evangelical meaning. The\r\nfirst evangelical Hymn-book was published in 1530, and the Swedish “Mass”\r\nin 1531, both drafted on Lutheran models. Laurentius Andreæ was made\r\nArchbishop of Upsala (1527), and a National Synod was held under his\r\npresidency at Orebro (1528), which guided the Reformation according to\r\nstrictly conservative Lutheran ideals. Thus before the death of Gustaf\r\nVasa, Sweden had joined the circle of Lutheran Churches, and its people\r\nwere slowly coming to understand the principles of the Reformation. The\r\nReformation was a very peaceful one. No one suffered death for his\r\nreligious opinions.\r\n\r\nThe fortunes of the Swedish Church were somewhat varied under the\r\nimmediate successors of Gustavus. His ill-fated son showed signs of\r\npreferring Calvinism, and insisted on the suppression of some of the\r\necclesiastical festivals and some of the old rites which had been\r\nretained; but these attempts ended with his reign. His brother and\r\nsuccessor, Johan III., took the opposite extreme, and coquetted long with\r\nRome, and with proposals for reunion,—proposals which had no serious\r\nresult. When Johan died in 1592, his son and successor, who had been\r\nelected King of Poland, and had become a Roman Catholic, aroused the fears\r\nof his Swedish subjects that he might go much further than his father. The\r\npeople resolved to make sure of their Protestantism before their new\r\nsovereign arrived in the country. A Synod was convened at which both lay\r\nand ecclesiastical deputies were present. The members first laid down the\r\ngeneral rule that the Holy Scriptures were their supreme doctrinal\r\nstandard, and then selected the Augsburg Confession as the Confession of\r\nthe Swedish Church. Luther’s Small Catechism, which had been removed from\r\nthe schools by King Johan III., was restored. This meeting at Upsala\r\nsettled for the future the ecclesiastical polity of Sweden. The country\r\nshowed its attachment to the stricter Lutheranism by adopting the Formula\r\nof Concord in 1664.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter VIII. The Religious Principles Inspiring The Reformation.(386)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 1. The Reformation did not take its rise from a Criticism of Doctrines.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe whole of Luther’s religious history, from his entrance into the\r\nconvent at Erfurt to the publication of the Augsburg Confession, shows\r\nthat the movement of which he was the soul and centre did not arise from\r\nany merely intellectual criticism of the doctrines of the mediæval church,\r\nand that it resulted in a great deal more than a revision or\r\nreconstruction of a system of doctrinal conceptions.(387) There is no\r\ntrace of any intellectual difficulties about doctrines or statement of\r\ndoctrines in Luther’s mind during the supreme crisis of his history. He\r\nwas driven out of the world of human life and hope, where he was well\r\nfitted to do a man’s work, by the overwhelming pressure of a great\r\npractical religious need—anxiety to save his soul. He has himself said\r\nthat the proverb that doubt makes a monk was true in his case. He doubted\r\nwhether he could save his soul in the world, and was therefore forced to\r\nleave it and enter the convent.\r\n\r\nHe had lost whatever evangelical teaching he had learnt in childhood or in\r\nFrau Cotta’s household at Eisenach. He had surrendered himself to the\r\npopular belief, fostered by the whole penitential system of the mediæval\r\nChurch, that man could and must make himself fit to receive the grace of\r\nGod which procures salvation. The self-torturing cry, “Oh, when wilt thou\r\nbecome holy and fit to obtain the grace of God?” (_O wenn will tu einmal\r\nfromm werden und genug thun du einen gnädigen Gott kriegest?_), drove him\r\ninto the convent. He believed, and the almost unanimous opinion of his age\r\nagreed with him, that there, if anywhere, he could find the peace he was\r\nseeking with such desperation.\r\n\r\nInside the convent he applied himself with all the force of a strong\r\nnature, using every means that the complicated penitential system of the\r\nChurch had provided to help him, to make himself pious and fit to be the\r\nreceptacle of the grace of God. He submitted to the orders of his\r\nsuperiors with the blind obedience which the most rigorous ecclesiastical\r\nstatutes demanded; he sought the comforting consolations which confession\r\nwas declared to give; he underwent every part of the complex system of\r\nexpiations which the mediæval Church recommended; he made full use of the\r\nsacraments, and waited in vain for the mysterious, inexplicable experience\r\nof the grace which was said to accompany and flow from them. He persevered\r\nin spite of the feeling of continuous failure. “If a monk ever reached\r\nheaven by monkery,” he has said, “I would have found my way there also;\r\nall my convent comrades will bear witness to that.”(388) He gave a still\r\nstronger proof of his loyalty to the mediæval Church and its advice to men\r\nin his mood of mind; he persevered in spite of the knowledge that his\r\ncomrades and his religious superiors believed him to be a young saint,\r\nwhile he knew that he was far otherwise, and that he was no nearer God\r\nthan he had been before he entered the monastery, or had begun his quest\r\nafter the sense of pardon of sin. The contrast between what his brethren\r\nthought he must be and what his own experience told him that he was, must\r\nhave added bitterness to the cup he had to drink during these terrible\r\nmonths in the Erfurt convent. He says himself:\r\n\r\n\r\n    “After I had made the profession, I was congratulated by the\r\n    prior, the convent, and the father-confessor, because I was now an\r\n    innocent child coming pure from baptism. Assuredly, I would\r\n    willingly have delighted in the glorious fact that I was such a\r\n    good man, who by his own deeds and without the merits of Christ’s\r\n    blood had made himself so fair and holy, and so easily too, and in\r\n    so short a time. But although I listened readily to the sweet\r\n    praise and glowing language about myself and my doings, and\r\n    allowed myself to be described as a wonder-worker, who could make\r\n    himself holy in such an easy way, and could swallow up death, and\r\n    the devil also, yet there was no power in it all to maintain me.\r\n    When even a small temptation came from sin or death I fell at\r\n    once, and found that neither baptism nor monkery could assist me;\r\n    I felt that I had long lost Christ and His baptism. I was the most\r\n    miserable man on earth; day and night there was only wailing and\r\n    despair, and no one could restrain me.”(389)\r\n\r\n\r\nHe adds that all he knew of Christ at this time was that He was “a stern\r\njudge from whom I would fain have fled and yet could not escape.”\r\n\r\nDuring these two years of anguish, Luther believed that he was battling\r\nwith himself and with his sin; he was really struggling with the religion\r\nof his times and Church. He was probing it, testing it, examining all its\r\ndepths, wrestling with all its means of grace, and finding that what were\r\nmeant to be sources of comfort and consolation were simply additional\r\nsprings of terror. He was too clear-sighted, his spiritual senses were too\r\nacute, he was too much in deadly earnest, not to see that none of these\r\naids were leading him to a solid ground of certainty on which he could\r\nbase his hopes for time and for eternity; and he was too honest with\r\nhimself to be persuaded that he was otherwise than his despair told\r\nhim.(390)\r\n\r\nAt length, guided in very faltering fashion by the Scriptures, especially\r\nby the Psalms and the Epistle to the Romans, by the Apostles’ Creed, and\r\nby fellow monks, he (to use his own words) came to see that the\r\nrighteousness of God (Rom. i. 17) is not the righteousness by which a\r\nrighteous God punishes the unrighteous and sinners, but that by which a\r\nmerciful God justifies us through faith (not _justitia, qua dens justus\r\nest et peccatores injustosque punit_, but that _qua nos deus misericors\r\njustificat per fidem_).(391) By _faith_, he says. What, then, did he mean\r\nby “faith”?\r\n\r\nHe replies:\r\n\r\n\r\n    “There are two kinds of believing: first, a believing about God\r\n    which means that I believe that what is said of God is true. This\r\n    faith is rather a form of knowledge than a faith. There is,\r\n    secondly, a believing in God which means that I put my trust in\r\n    Him, give myself up to thinking that I can have dealings with Him,\r\n    and believe without any doubt that He will be and do to me\r\n    according to the things said of Him. Such faith, _which throws\r\n    itself upon God_, whether in life or in death, alone makes a\r\n    Christian man.”(392)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe faith which he prized is that religious faculty which “throws itself\r\nupon God”; and from the first Luther recognised that faith of this kind\r\nwas a direct gift from God. Having it we have everything; without it we\r\nhave nothing. Here we find something entirely new, or at least hitherto\r\nunexpressed, so far as mediæval theology was concerned. Mediæval\r\ntheologians had recognised faith in the sense of what Luther called\r\n_frigida opinio_, and it is difficult to conceive that they did not also\r\nindirectly acknowledge that there must be something like trust or\r\n_fiducia_; but faith with them was simply one among many human efforts all\r\nequally necessary in order to see and know God. Luther recognised that\r\nthere was this kind of faith, which a man begets and brings to pass in\r\nhimself by assent to doctrines of some sort. But he did not think much of\r\nit. He calls it worthless because it gives us nothing.\r\n\r\n\r\n    “They think that faith is a thing which they may have or not have\r\n    at will, like any other natural human thing; so when they arrive\r\n    at a conclusion and say, ‘Truly the doctrine is correct, and\r\n    therefore I believe it,’ then they think that this is faith. Now,\r\n    when they see and feel that no change has been wrought in\r\n    themselves and in others, and that works do not follow, and they\r\n    remain as before in the old nature, then they think that the faith\r\n    is not good enough, but that there must be something more and\r\n    greater.”(393)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe real faith, the faith which is trust, the divine gift which impels us\r\nto throw ourselves upon God, gives us the living assurance of a living\r\nGod, who has revealed Himself, made us see His loving Fatherly heart in\r\nChrist Jesus; and that is the Christian religion in its very core and\r\ncentre. The sum of Christianity is—(1) God manifest in Christ, the God of\r\ngrace, accessible by every Christian man and woman; and (2) unwavering\r\ntrust in Him who has given Himself to us in Christ Jesus,—unwavering,\r\nbecause Christ with His work has undertaken our cause and made it His.\r\n\r\nThe God we have access to and Whom we can trust because we have thrown\r\nourselves upon Him and have found that He sustains us, is no philosophical\r\nabstraction, to be described in definitions and argued about in\r\nsyllogisms. He is seen and known, because we see and know Christ Jesus.\r\n“He that hath seen Me hath seen the Father.” For with Luther and all the\r\nReformers, Christ fills the whole sphere of God; and they do not recognise\r\nany theology which is not a Christology.\r\n\r\nThe faith which makes us throw ourselves upon God is no mood of mere\r\nmystical abandonment. It is our very life, as Luther was never tired of\r\nsaying. It is God within us, and wells forth in all kinds of activities.\r\n\r\n\r\n    “It is a living, busy, active, powerful thing, faith; it is\r\n    impossible for it not to do us good continually. It never asks\r\n    whether good works are to be done; it has done them before there\r\n    is time to ask the question, and it is always doing them.”(394)\r\n\r\n\r\nChristianity is therefore an interwoven tissue of promises and prayers of\r\nfaith. On the one side there is the Father, revealing Himself, sending\r\ndown to us His promises which are yea and amen in Christ Jesus; and on the\r\nother side there are the hearts of men ascending in faith to God,\r\nreceiving, accepting, and resting on the promises of God, and on God who\r\nalways gives Himself in His promises.\r\n\r\nThis is what came to Luther and ended his long and terrible struggle. He\r\nis unwearied in describing it. The descriptions are very varied, so far as\r\nexternal form and expression go,—now texts from the Psalms, the Prophets,\r\nor the New Testament most aptly quoted; now phrases borrowed from the\r\npicturesque language of the mediæval mystics; now sentences of striking,\r\neven rugged, originality; sometimes propositions taken from the mediæval\r\nscholastic. But whatever the words, the meaning is always the same.\r\n\r\nThis conception of what is meant by Christianity is the religious soul of\r\nthe Reformation. It contains within it all the distinctively religious\r\nprinciples which inspired it. It can scarcely be called a dogma. It is an\r\nexperience, and the phrases which set it forth are the descriptions of an\r\nexperience which a human soul has gone through. The thing itself is beyond\r\nexact definition—as all deep experiences are. It must be felt and gone\r\nthrough to be known. The Reformation started from this personal experience\r\nof the believing Christian, which it declared to be the one elemental fact\r\nin Christianity which could never be proved by argument and could never be\r\ndissolved away by speculation. It proclaimed the great truth, which had\r\nbeen universally neglected throughout the whole period of mediæval\r\ntheology by everyone except the Mystics, that in order to know God man\r\nmust be in living touch with God Himself. Therein lay its originality and\r\nits power. Luther rediscovered religion when he declared that the truly\r\nChristian man must cling directly and with a living faith to the God Who\r\nspeaks to him in Christ, saying, “I am thy salvation.” The earlier\r\nReformers never forgot this. Luther proclaimed his discovery, he never\r\nattempted to prove it by argument; it was something self-evident—seen and\r\nknown when experienced.\r\n\r\nThis is always the way with great religious pioneers and leaders. They\r\nhave all had the prophetic gift of spiritual vision, and the magnetic\r\nspeech to proclaim what they have seen, felt, and known. They have all\r\nhad, in a far-off way, the insight and manner of Jesus.\r\n\r\nWhen our Lord appeared among men claiming to be more than a wise man or a\r\nprophet, declaring that He was the Messiah, the Son of Man and the Son of\r\nGod, when He announced that all men had need of Him, and that He alone\r\ncould save and redeem, He set forth His claims in a manner unique among\r\nfounders of religions. He made them calmly and as a matter of course. He\r\nnever explained elaborately why He assumed the titles He took. He never\r\nreasoned about His position as the only Saviour. He simply announced it,\r\nletting the conviction of the truth steal almost insensibly into the minds\r\nand hearts of His followers as they saw His deeds and heard His words. He\r\nassumed that they must interpret His death in one way only. This was\r\nalways His manner. It was not His way to explain mysteries our curiosity\r\nwould fain penetrate. He quietly took for granted many things we would\r\nlike to argue about. His sayings came from One who lived in perpetual\r\ncommunion with the Unseen Father, and He uttered them quietly and\r\nassuredly, confident that they carried with them their own self-evidencing\r\npower.\r\n\r\nSo it was with St. Paul. His letters and sermons are full of arguments, no\r\ndoubt, full of pleadings and persuasion, but they all start from and rest\r\nupon his vision of the living, risen Saviour. His last word is always,\r\n“When it pleased God to reveal His Son in me”; that was the elemental fact\r\nwhich he proclaimed and which summed up everything, the personal\r\nexperience from which he started on his career as an apostle. The place of\r\nAthanasius as a great religious leader has been obscured by his position\r\nas a theologian; but when we turn to his writings, where do we find less\r\nof what is commonly called dogmatic theology? There is argument,\r\nreasoning, searching for proofs and their statement; but all that belongs\r\nto the outworks in his teaching. The central citadel is a spiritual\r\nintuition—I _know_ that _my_ Saviour is the God Who made heaven and earth.\r\nHe took his stand firmly and unflinchingly on that personal experience,\r\nand all else mattered little compared with the fundamental spiritual fact.\r\nIt was not his arguments, but his unflinching faith that convinced his\r\ngeneration.\r\n\r\nSo it was with Augustine, Bernard,(395) Francis—so it has been with every\r\ngreat religious leader of the Christian people. His strength, whether of\r\nknowledge, or conviction, or sympathy,—his driving power, if the phrase\r\nmay be used,—has always come from direct communion with the unseen, and\r\nrests upon the fact, felt and known by himself and communicated to others\r\nby a mysterious sympathy, that it has pleased God to reveal Christ in him\r\nin some way or other.\r\n\r\nSo it was with Luther and the Reformation in which he was the leader. Its\r\ndriving power was a great religious experience, old, for it has come to\r\nthe people of God in all generations, and yet new and fresh as it is the\r\nnature of all such experiences to be. He _knew_ that his life was hid with\r\nChrist in God in spite of all evil, in spite of sin and sense of guilt.\r\nHis old dread of God had vanished, and instead of it there had arisen in\r\nhis heart a love to God in answer to the love which came from the vision\r\nof the Father revealing Himself. He had experienced this, and he had\r\nproclaimed what he had gone through; and the experience and its\r\nproclamation were the foundation on which the Reformation was built. Its\r\nbeginnings were not doctrinal but experimental.\r\n\r\nDoctrines, indeed, are not the beginnings of things; they are, at the\r\nbest, storehouses of past and blessed experiences. This is true of most\r\nknowledge in all departments of research. We may recognise that there is\r\nsome practical use in the rules of logic, ancient and modern, but we know\r\nthat they are but the uncouth and inadequate symbols of the ways in which\r\nan indefinable mental tact, whose delicacy varies with the mind that uses\r\nit, perceives divergences and affinities, and weaves its web of knowledge\r\nin ways that are past finding out. We know that logical argument is a good\r\nshield but a bad sword, and that while syllogisms may silence, they seldom\r\nconvince; that persuasion arises from a subtle sympathy of soul with soul,\r\nwhich is as indefinable as the personalities which exhale it. There is\r\nalways at the basis of knowledge of men and things this delicate contact\r\nof personality with personality, whether we think of the gathering, or\r\nassorting, or exchanging the wisdom we possess. If this be true of our\r\nknowledge of common things, it is overwhelmingly so of all knowledge of\r\nGod and of things divine. We must be in touch with God to know Him in the\r\ntrue sense of knowledge. At the basis of every real advance in religion\r\nthere must be an intimate vision of God impressed upon us as a religious\r\nexperience which we know to be true because we have felt it; and what one\r\nhas, another receives by a species of spiritual contagion. The revival\r\nunder Francis of Assisi spread as it did because the fire flaming in the\r\nheart of the preacher was also kindled in the hearts of his hearers.\r\nLuther headed a Reformation because men felt and knew that he had, as he\r\nsaid, found a gracious God by trusting in the grace of God revealed to him\r\nin Christ Jesus. It was not the Augsburg Confession that made the\r\nReformation; it was the expansion of that religious experience which finds\r\nvery inadequate description in that or in any other statement of\r\ndoctrines.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 2. The universal Priesthood of Believers.\r\n\r\n\r\nLuther’s religious experience, that he, a sinner, received forgiveness by\r\nsimply throwing himself on God revealed in Christ Jesus the Saviour, came\r\nto him as an astounding revelation which was almost too great to be put\r\ninto words. He tried to express it in varying ways, all of which he felt\r\ntoo utterly inadequate to describe it. We can see how he laboured at it\r\nfrom 1512 to 1517. It lay hidden in his discourse to the assembly of\r\nclergy in the episcopal palace at Ziesar (June 5th, 1512), when he\r\ndeclared that all reform must begin in the hearts of individual men. We\r\ncan see it growing more and more articulate in his annotations, notes, and\r\nheads of lectures on the Psalms, delivered in the years 1513-1516,\r\nstruggling to free itself from the phrases of the Scholastic Theology\r\nwhich could not really express it. His private letters, in which he was\r\nless hampered by the phraseology which he still believed appropriate to\r\ntheology, are full of happier expressions.(396) _Justificatio_ is\r\n_vivificatio_, and means to redeem from sins without any merit in the\r\nperson redeemed; it takes place when sin is not imputed, but the penitents\r\nare reputed righteous. Grace is the pity (_misericordia_) of God; it\r\nmanifests itself in the remission of sins; it is the truth of God seen in\r\nthe fulfilment of His promises in the historical work of Christ; Jesus\r\nChrist Himself is grace, is the way, is life and salvation. Faith is trust\r\nin the truth of God as manifested in the life and work of Jesus Christ; it\r\nis to believe in God; it is a knowledge of the Cross of Christ; it is to\r\nunderstand that the Son of God became incarnate, was crucified, and raised\r\nagain for our salvation. The three central thoughts—_justification_,\r\n_grace_, _faith_—expressed in these inadequate phrases, are always looked\r\nupon and used to regulate that estimate of ourselves which forms the basis\r\nof piety. It is needless to trace the growing adequacy of the description.\r\nLuther at last found words to say that the central thought in Christianity\r\nis that the believer in possession of faith, which is itself the gift of\r\nGod, is able to throw himself on God in Christ Who is his salvation and\r\nWho has mirrored Himself for us in Christ Jesus. He had trod the weary\r\nround that Augustine had gone before him; he had tried _to help himself_\r\nin every possible way; he had found that with all his striving he could do\r\nnothing. Then, strange and mysterious as it was, the discovery had not\r\nbrought despair, but rejoicing and comfort; for since there was no help\r\nwhatever in man, his soul had been forced to find _all_—not part, but\r\nall—help in God. When he was able to express his experience he could say\r\nthat the faith which throws itself on God, which is God’s own gift, is the\r\ncertainty of the forgiveness of sins. It was no adherence to doctrines\r\nmore or less clearly comprehended; it was no act of initiation to be\r\nfollowed by a nearer approach to God and a larger measure of His grace; it\r\nwas the power which gives life, certainty, peace, continuous\r\nself-surrender to God as the Father, and which transforms and renews the\r\nwhole man. It was the life of the soul; it was Christianity within the\r\nbeliever—as Jesus Christ and His work is Christianity outside the\r\nbeliever.\r\n\r\nIt is manifest that as soon as this experience attained articulate\r\nstatement, it was bound to discredit much that was in mediæval theology\r\nand religious usage. Yet the striking thing about Luther was that he never\r\nsought to employ it in this way until one great abuse forced itself upon\r\nhim and compelled him to test it by this touchstone of what true\r\nChristianity was. This reserve not only shows that there was nothing\r\nrevolutionary in the character of Luther, nothing romantic or quixotic, it\r\nalso manifests the quiet greatness of the man. Nor was there anything in\r\nthe fundamental religious experience of Luther which necessarily\r\nconflicted with the contents of the old ecclesiastical doctrines, or even\r\nwith the common usages of the religious life. There was a change in the\r\nattitude towards both, and an entirely new estimate of their religious\r\nvalue, but nothing which called for their immediate criticism, still less\r\nfor their destruction. Faith, which was the Christian life, could no\r\nlonger be based upon them; they were not the essential things that they\r\nhad been supposed to be; but they might have their uses if kept in their\r\nproper places—aids to all holy living, but not that from which the life\r\nsprang. The thought that the entire sum of religion consists in\r\n“unwavering trust of the heart in Him Who has given Himself to us in\r\nChrist as our Father, personal assurance of faith, because Christ with His\r\nwork undertakes our cause,” simplified religion marvellously, and made\r\nmany things which had been regarded as essential mere outside auxiliaries.\r\nBut it did not necessarily sweep them away. Though the acceptance of\r\ncertain forms of doctrine, auricular confession, the monastic life,\r\ncommunion by the laity in one “kind” only in the Sacrament of the Supper,\r\na celibate priesthood, fasting, going on pilgrimages, not to eat meat on\r\nFriday, had nothing to do with the essentials of the Christian life; still\r\nit was not necessary to insist on eating meat on Friday, on abstaining\r\nfrom fasting, and so on. The great matter was the spirit in which such\r\nthings were performed or left undone. What the fundamental religious\r\nexperience had done was to show the liberty of the Christian man to trust\r\ncourageously in God and count all things of little moment compared with\r\nthis which was the one thing needful.\r\n\r\n\r\n    “Out of a complex system of expiations, good deeds, and\r\n    comfortings, of strict statutes and uncertain apportionments of\r\n    grace, out of magic and blind obedience, Luther led religion forth\r\n    and gave it a strenuously concentrated form. The Christian\r\n    religion is the living assurance of the living God Who has\r\n    revealed Himself and opened His heart in Christ—nothing\r\n    more.”(397)\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was a vital part of this fundamental experience that the living God Who\r\nhad manifested Himself in Christ was accessible to every Christian. To\r\nquote Harnack again:\r\n\r\n\r\n    “Rising above all anxieties and terrors, above all ascetic\r\n    devices, above all directions of theology, above all interventions\r\n    of hierarchy and Sacraments, Luther ventured to lay hold of God\r\n    Himself in Christ, and in this act of faith, which he recognised\r\n    as God’s work, his whole being obtained stability and firmness,\r\n    nay, even a personal joy and certainty, which no mediæval\r\n    Christian had ever possessed.”(398)\r\n\r\n\r\nGod Himself gave the believer the power to throw himself directly on God.\r\nBut this contradicted one of the most widely diffused and most strongly\r\nheld religious beliefs of the mediæval Church, and was bound to come in\r\ncollision with it whenever the two were confronted with each other. It was\r\nthe universal conception of mediæval piety that the mediation of a priest\r\nwas essential to salvation. Mediæval Christians believed with more or less\r\ndistinctness that the supernatural life of the soul was _created_,\r\nnourished, and perfected through the sacraments, and that the priests\r\nadministering them possessed, in virtue of their ordination, miraculous\r\npowers whereby they daily offered the true sacrifice of Jesus Christ upon\r\nthe altar, forgave the sins of men, and taught the truths of salvation\r\nwith divine authority. It was this universally accepted power of a\r\nmediatorial priesthood which had enslaved Europe, and which had rendered\r\nthe liberty of a Christian man an impossible thing. Everywhere the\r\npriesthood barred, or was supposed to be able to bar, the way to God. The\r\nChurch, which ought to have shown how God Who had revealed Himself in\r\nChrist was accessible to every believer, had surrounded the inner shrine\r\nof the sanctuary of His Presence with a triple wall of defence which\r\nprevented entrance. When man or woman felt sorrow for sin, they were\r\ninstructed to go, not to God, but to a man, often of immoral life, and\r\nconfess their sins to him because he was a priest. When they wished to\r\nhear the comforting words of pardon spoken, it was not from God, but from\r\na priest that the assurance was supposed to come. God’s grace, to help to\r\nholy living and to bring comfort in dying, was given, it was said, only\r\nthrough a series of sacraments which fenced man’s life round, and priests\r\ncould give or withhold these sacraments. Man was born again in baptism; he\r\ncame of age spiritually in confirmation; his marriage was cleansed from\r\nthe sin of lust in the sacrament of matrimony; penance brought back his\r\nspiritual life slain by deadly sin; the Eucharist gave him with his voyage\r\nvictual as he journeyed through life; and deathbed grace was imparted in\r\nextreme unction. These ceremonies were not the signs and promises of the\r\nfree grace of God, under whose wide canopy, as under that of heaven, man\r\nlived his spiritual life. They were jealously guarded doors from out of\r\nwhich grudgingly, and commonly not without fees, the priests dispensed the\r\nfree grace of God.\r\n\r\nDuring the later Middle Ages a gross abuse made the evils of this\r\nconception of a mediating priesthood emphatic. The practical evil lying in\r\nthe whole thought was not so very apparent when the matter was regarded\r\nfrom the side of giving out the grace of God; but when it came to\r\nwithholding it, then it was seen what the whole conception meant. The\r\nBishops of Rome gave the peoples of Europe many an object lesson on this.\r\nIf a town, or a district, or a whole country had offended the Pope and the\r\nCuria, it was placed under an _interdict_, and the priests were commanded\r\nto refuse the sacraments to the people. They stood between the newborn\r\nbabe and the initial grace supposed to be bestowed in baptism, and to be\r\nabsolutely withheld if baptism was not administered; between the dying man\r\nand the deathbed grace which was received in extreme unction; between\r\nyoung men and women and legal marriage blessed by God; between the people\r\nand daily worship and the bestowal of grace in the Eucharist. The God of\r\ngrace could not be approached, the blessings of pardon and strength for\r\nholy living could not be procured, because the magistrates of a town or\r\nthe king and councillors of a nation had offended the Bishop of Rome on an\r\naffair of worldly policy. The Church, _i.e._ the clergy, who were by the\r\ntheory enabled to refuse to communicate the grace of God, barred all\r\naccess to the God who had revealed Himself in Christ Jesus. The Pope by a\r\nstroke of the pen could prevent a whole nation, so it was believed, from\r\napproaching God, because he could prohibit priests from performing the\r\nusual sacramental acts which alone brought Him near. An _interdict_ meant\r\nspiritual death to the district on which it fell, and on the mediæval\r\ntheory it was more deadly to the spiritual life than the worst of plagues,\r\nthe Black Death itself, was to the body. An _interdict_ made the plainest\r\nintellect see, understand, and shudder at the awful and mysterious powers\r\nwhich a mediatorial priesthood was said to possess.\r\n\r\nThe fundamental religious experience of Luther had made him know that the\r\nFather, who has revealed Himself in His Son, is accessible to every humble\r\npenitent and faithful seeker after God. He proclaimed aloud the spiritual\r\npriesthood of all believers. He stated it with his usual graphic emphasis\r\nin that tract of his, which he always said contained the marrow of his\r\nmessage—_Concerning Christian Liberty_. He begins by an antithesis: “A\r\nChristian man is the most free lord of all, and subject to none: a\r\nChristian man is the most dutiful servant of all, and subject to\r\neveryone”; or, as St. Paul puts it, “Though I be free from all men, yet\r\nhave I made myself servant of all.” He expounds this by showing that no\r\noutward things have any influence in producing Christian righteousness or\r\nliberty; neither eating, drinking, nor anything of the kind, neither\r\nhunger nor thirst have to do with the liberty or the slavery of the soul.\r\nIt does not profit the soul to wear sacred vestments or to dwell in sacred\r\nplaces; nor does it harm the soul to be clothed in worldly raiment, and to\r\neat and drink in the ordinary fashion. The soul can do without everything\r\nexcept the word of God, and this word of God is the gospel of God\r\nconcerning His Son, incarnate, suffering, risen, and glorified through the\r\nSpirit the Sanctifier. “To preach Christ is to feed the soul, to justify\r\nit, to set it free, to save it, if it believes the preaching; for faith\r\nalone and the efficacious use of the word of God bring salvation.” It is\r\nfaith that incorporates Christ with the believer, and in this way “the\r\nsoul through faith alone, without works, is, from the word of God,\r\njustified, sanctified, endued with truth, peace, liberty, and filled full\r\nwith every good thing, and is truly made the child of God.” For faith\r\nbrings the soul and the word together, and the soul is acted upon by the\r\nword, as iron exposed to fire glows like fire because of its union with\r\nthe fire. Faith honours and reveres Him in Whom it trusts, and cleaves to\r\nHis promises, never doubting but that He overrules all for the best. Faith\r\nunites the soul to Christ, so that “Christ and the soul become one flesh.”\r\n“Thus the believing soul, by the pledge of its faith in Christ, becomes\r\nfree from all sin, fearless of death, safe from hell, and endowed with the\r\neternal righteousness, life, and salvation of its husband Christ.” This\r\ngives the liberty of the Christian man; no dangers can really harm him, no\r\nsorrows utterly overwhelm him: for he is always accompanied by the Christ\r\nto whom he is united by his faith.\r\n\r\n“Here you will ask,” says Luther, “ ‘If all who are in the Church are\r\npriests, by what character are those whom we now call priests to be\r\ndistinguished from the laity?’ I reply, By the use of these words\r\n‘priest,’ ‘clergy,’ ‘spiritual person,’ ‘ecclesiastic,’ an injustice has\r\nbeen done, since they have been transferred from the remaining body of\r\nChristians to those few who are now, by a hurtful custom, called\r\necclesiastics. For Holy Scripture makes no distinction between them,\r\nexcept that those who are now boastfully called Popes, bishops, and lords,\r\nit calls ministers, servants, and stewards, who are to serve the rest in\r\nthe ministry of the word, for teaching the faith of Christ and the liberty\r\nof believers. For though it is true that we are all equally priests, yet\r\nwe cannot, nor ought we if we could, all to minister and teach publicly.”\r\n\r\nThe first part of the treatise shows that everything which a Christian man\r\nhas goes back in the end to his faith; if he has this he has all; if he\r\nhas it not, nothing else suffices him. In the same way the second part\r\nshows that everything that a Christian man does must come from his faith.\r\nIt may be necessary to fast and keep the body under; it will be necessary\r\nto make use of all the ceremonies of divine service which have been found\r\neffectual for the spiritual education of man. The thing to remember is\r\nthat these are not good works in themselves in the sense of making a man\r\ngood; they are all rather the signs of his faith, and are to be done with\r\njoy, because they are done to the God to whom faith unites us. So\r\necclesiastical ceremonies, or what may be called the machinery of Church\r\nlife, are valuable, and indeed indispensable to the life of the soul,\r\nprovided only they are regarded in the proper way and kept in their proper\r\nplace; but they may become harmful and most destructive of the true\r\nreligious life if they are considered in any other light than that of\r\nmeans to an end. “We do not condemn works,” says Luther, “nay we attach\r\nthe highest value to them. We only condemn that opinion of works which\r\nregards them as constituting true righteousness.” They are, he explains,\r\nlike the scaffolding of a building, eminently useful so long as they\r\nassist the builder; harmful if they obstruct; and at the best of temporary\r\nvalue. They are destructive to the spiritual life when they come between\r\nthe soul and God. It follows, therefore, that if through human corruption\r\nand neglect of the plain precepts of the word of God these ecclesiastical\r\nusages hinder instead of aid the true growth of the soul, they ought to be\r\nchanged or done away with; and the fact that the soul of man, in the last\r\nresort, needs absolutely nothing but the word of God dwelling within it,\r\ngives men courage and tranquillity in demanding their reformation.\r\n\r\nIn the same way fellow-men are not to be allowed to come between God and\r\nthe human soul; and there is no need that they should. So far as spiritual\r\nposition and privileges go, the laity are on the very same level as the\r\nclergy, for laity and clergy alike have immediate access to God through\r\nfaith, and both are obliged to do what lies in them to further the advance\r\nof the kingdom of God among their fellow-men. All believing laymen “are\r\nworthy to appear before God, to pray for others, to teach each other\r\nmutually the things that are of God ... and as our heavenly Father has\r\nfreely helped us in Christ, so we ought freely to help our neighbours by\r\nour body and our works, and each should become to the other a sort of\r\nChrist, so that we may be mutually Christs, and that the same Christ may\r\nbe in all of us; that we may be truly Christians.” Luther asserted that\r\nmen and women living their lives in the family, in the workshop, in the\r\ncivic world, held their position there, not by a kind of indirect\r\npermission wrung from God out of His compassion for human frailties, but\r\nby as direct a vocation as called a man to what by mistake had been deemed\r\nthe only “religious life.” The difference between clergy and laity did not\r\nconsist in the supposed fact that the former were a spiritual order of a\r\nsuperior rank in the religious life, while the latter belonged to a lower\r\ncondition. The clergy differed from the laity simply in this, that they\r\nhad been selected to perform certain definite duties; but the function did\r\nnot make him who performed it a holier man intrinsically. If the clergy\r\nmisused their position and did not do the work they were set apart to\r\nperform, there was no reason why they should not be compelled by the laity\r\nto amend their ways. Even in the celebration of the holiest rites there\r\nwas no distinction between clergy and laity save that to prevent disorder\r\nthe former presided over the rites in which all engaged. At the Eucharist\r\n\r\n\r\n    “our priest or minister stands before the altar, having been\r\n    publicly called to his priestly function; he repeats publicly and\r\n    distinctly Christ’s words of the institution; he takes the Bread\r\n    and the Wine, and distributes it according to Christ’s words; and\r\n    we all kneel beside him and around him, men and women, young and\r\n    old, master and servant, mistress and maid, all holy priests\r\n    together, sanctified by the blood of Christ. We are there in our\r\n    priestly dignity.... We do not let the priest proclaim for himself\r\n    the ordinance of Christ; but he is the mouthpiece of us all, and\r\n    we all say it with him in our hearts with true faith in the Lamb\r\n    of God Who feeds us with His Body and Blood.”\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was this principle of the Priesthood of all Believers which delivered\r\nmen from the vague fear of the clergy, and which was a spur to incite them\r\nto undertake the reformation of the Church which was so much needed. It is\r\nthe one great religious principle which lies at the basis of the whole\r\nReformation movement. It was the rock on which all attempts at reunion\r\nwith an unreformed Christendom were wrecked. It is the one outstanding\r\ndifference between the followers of the reformed and the mediæval\r\nreligion.\r\n\r\nAlmost all the distinctive principles of the Reformation group themselves\r\nround this one thought of the Priesthood of all Believers. It is\r\nsufficient for our purpose to look at Justification by Faith, the\r\nconceptions of the Holy Scriptures, of the Person of Christ, and of the\r\nChurch.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 3. Justification by Faith.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen Luther, oppressed with a sense of sin, entered the convent, he was\r\nburdened by the ideas of traditional religion, that the penitent must\r\nprepare himself in some way so as to render himself fit to experience that\r\nsense of the grace of God which gives the certainty of pardon. It was not\r\nuntil he had thoroughly freed himself from that weight that he experienced\r\nthe sense of pardon he sought. This practical experience of his must\r\nalways be kept in view when we try to conceive what he meant by\r\nJustification by Faith.\r\n\r\nAs has been already said, Luther recognised that there were two kinds of\r\nfaith,—one which man himself begot and through which he was able to give\r\nassent to doctrines of some sort; and another which Luther vehemently\r\nasserted was the pure gift of God. The first he thought comparatively\r\nunimportant; the latter was all in all to him. Faith is always used in the\r\nlatter sense when the Reformers speak about _Justification by Faith_; and\r\nthe sharp distinction which Luther draws between the two is a very\r\nimportant element in determining what he meant when he said that we are\r\njustified by faith alone.\r\n\r\nThis faith of the highest kind, the true faith, has its beginning by God\r\nworking on us and in us. It is continually fed and kept strong by the word\r\nof God. The promise of God on God’s side and faith on man’s side are two\r\ncorrelative things; “for where there is no promise, there is no faith.”\r\nLuther brings out what this true faith is by contrasting it with the other\r\nkind of faith in two very instructive and trenchant passages:\r\n\r\n\r\n    “When faith is of the kind that God awakens and creates in the\r\n    heart, then a man trusts in Christ. He is then so securely founded\r\n    on Christ that he can hurl defiance at sin, death, hell, the\r\n    devil, and all God’s enemies. He fears no ill, however hard and\r\n    cruel it may prove to be. Such is the nature of true faith, which\r\n    is utterly different from the faith of the sophists (the\r\n    Schoolmen), Jews, and Turks. Their faith, produced by their\r\n    thoughts, simply lights upon a thing, accepts it, believes that it\r\n    is this or that. God has no dealings with such delusion; it is the\r\n    work of man, and comes from nature, from the free will of man; and\r\n    men possessing it can say, repeating what others have said: I\r\n    believe that there is a God. I believe that Christ was born, died,\r\n    rose again for me. But what the real faith is, and how powerful a\r\n    thing it is, of this they know nothing.”(399)\r\n\r\n\r\nHe says again:\r\n\r\n\r\n    “Wherefore, beware of that faith which is manufactured or\r\n    imagined; for the true faith is not the work of man, and therefore\r\n    the faith which is manufactured or imagined will not avail in\r\n    death, but will be overcome and utterly overthrown by sin, by the\r\n    devil, and by the pains of hell. The true faith is the heart’s\r\n    utter trust in Christ, and God alone awakens this in us. He who\r\n    has it is blessed, he who has it not is cursed.”(400)\r\n\r\n\r\nThis faith has an outside fact to rest upon—the historical Christ. It is\r\nneither helped nor hindered by a doctrine of the Person of Christ, nor by\r\na minute and elaborate knowledge of the details of our Lord’s earthly\r\nministry. The man who has the faith may know a great deal about the\r\ndoctrine of the Person of Christ: that will do his faith no harm but good,\r\nprovided only he does not make the mistake of thinking that doctrines\r\nabout Christ, ways by which the human understanding tries to conceive the\r\nfact, are either the fact itself or something better than the fact. He may\r\nknow a great deal about the history of Jesus, and it is well to know as\r\nmuch as possible; but the amount of knowledge scarcely affects the faith.\r\nWayfaring men, though fools, need not err in the pathway of faith.\r\n\r\nThe faith which is the gift of God makes us see the practical meaning in\r\nthe fact of the historic Christ—this, namely, that Jesus Christ is there\r\nbefore us the manifestation of the Fatherly love of God, revealing to us\r\nour own forgiveness, and with it the possibilities of the Kingdom of God\r\nand of our place therein. The fact of the historic Christ is there, seen\r\nby men in a natural way; but it is the power of God lying in the faith\r\nwhich He has given us that makes us see with full certainty the meaning of\r\nthe fact of the historic Christ for us and for our salvation. Moreover,\r\nthis vision of God in the historic Christ, which is the deepest of all\r\npersonal things, always involves something social. It brings us within the\r\nfamily of the faithful, within the Christian fellowship with its\r\nconfirming evidences of faith and love. The power of faith comes to us\r\nsingly, but seldom solitarily; the trust we have in God in Christ is\r\nfaintly mirrored in the faith we learn to have in the members of the\r\nhousehold of faith, and in their manifestations of faith and the love\r\nwhich faith begets.\r\n\r\nWhat has been called the doctrine of Justification by Faith is therefore\r\nrather the description of a religious experience within the believer; and\r\nthe meaning of the experience is simply this. The believer, who because he\r\nhas faith—the faith which is the gift of God, which is our life and which\r\nregenerates—is regenerate and a member of the Christian fellowship, and is\r\nable to do good works and actually does them, does not find his standing\r\nas a person justified in the sight of God, his righteousness, his\r\nassurance of pardon and salvation, in those good works which he really can\r\ndo, but only in the mediatorial and perfectly righteous work of Christ\r\nwhich he has learned to appropriate in faith. His good works, however\r\nreally good, are necessarily imperfect, and in this experience which we\r\ncall Justification by Faith the believer compares his own imperfect good\r\nworks with the perfect work of Christ, and recognises that his pardon and\r\nsalvation depends on that alone. This comparison quiets souls anxious\r\nabout their salvation, and soothes pious consciences; and the sense of\r\nforgiveness which comes in this way is always experienced as a revelation\r\nof wonderful love. This justification is called an act, and is contrasted\r\nwith a work; but the contrast, though true, is apt to mislead through\r\nhuman analogies which will intrude. It is an act, but an act of God; and\r\ndivine acts are never done and done with, they are always continuous.\r\nLuther rings the changes upon this. He warns us against thinking that the\r\nact of forgiveness is all done in a single moment. The priestly absolution\r\nwas the work of a moment, and had to be done over and over again; but the\r\ndivine pronouncement of pardon is continuous simply because it is God who\r\nmakes it. He says:\r\n\r\n\r\n    “For just as the sun shines and enlightens none the less brightly\r\n    when I close my eyes, so this throne of grace, this forgiveness of\r\n    sins, is always there, even though I fall. Just as I see the sun\r\n    again when I open my eyes, so I have forgiveness and the sense of\r\n    it once more when I look up and return to Christ. We are not to\r\n    measure forgiveness as narrowly as fools dream.”(401)\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the Protestant polemic with Roman Catholic doctrine, the conception of\r\nJustification by Faith is contrasted with that of Justification by Works;\r\nbut the contrast is somewhat misleading. For the word justification is\r\nused in different meanings in the two phrases. The direct counterpart in\r\nRoman Catholic usage to the Reformation thought of Justification by Faith\r\nis the absolution pronounced by a priest; and here as always the Reformer\r\nappeals from man to God. The two conceptions belong to separate spheres of\r\nthought.\r\n\r\n\r\n    “The justification of which the mediæval Christian had experience\r\n    was the descending of an outward stream of forces upon him from\r\n    the supersensible world, through the Incarnation, in the channels\r\n    of ecclesiastical institutions, priestly consecration, sacraments,\r\n    confession, and good works; it was something which came from his\r\n    connection with a supersensible organisation which surrounded him.\r\n    The justification by faith which Luther experienced within his\r\n    soul was the personal experience of the believer standing in the\r\n    continuous line of the Christian fellowship, who receives the\r\n    assurance of the grace of God in his exercise of a personal\r\n    faith,—an experience which comes from appropriating the work of\r\n    Christ which he is able to do by that faith which is the gift of\r\n    God.”(402)\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the one case, the Protestant, justification is a personal experience\r\nwhich is complete in itself, and does not depend on any external\r\nmachinery; in the other, the Mediæval, it is a prolonged action of usages,\r\nsacraments, external machinery of all kinds, which by their combined\r\neffect are supposed to change a sinner gradually into a saint, righteous\r\nin the eyes of God. With the former, it is a continuous experience; with\r\nthe latter, it cannot fail to be intermittent as the external means are\r\nactually employed or for a time laid aside.\r\n\r\nThe meaning of the Reformation doctrine of Justification by Faith may be\r\nfurther brought out by contrasting it with the theory which was taught by\r\nthat later school of Scholastic theology which was all-powerful at the\r\nbeginning of the sixteenth century. The more evangelical theory of Thomas\r\nAquinas was largely neglected, and the Nominalist Schoolmen based their\r\nexpositions of the doctrine on the teaching of John Duns Scotus.\r\n\r\nIt must be remembered that mediæval theology never repudiated the theology\r\nof Augustine, and admitted in theory at least that man’s salvation, and\r\njustification as part of it, always depended in the last resort on the\r\nprevenient grace of God; in their reverence for the teaching of Aristotle,\r\nthey believed that they had also to make room for the action of the free\r\nwill of man which they always looked on as the pure capacity of choice\r\nbetween two alternatives. John Duns Scotus got rid of a certain confusion\r\nwhich existed between the _gratia operans_ and _gratia co-operans_ of\r\nAugustine by speaking of the grace of God, which lay at the basis of man’s\r\njustification, as a _gratia habitualis_, or an operation of the grace of\r\nGod which gave to the will of man an habitual tendency to love towards God\r\nand man. He alleged that when conduct is considered, an act of the will is\r\nmore important than any habitual tendency, for it is the act which makes\r\nuse of the habit, and apart from the act, the habit is a mere inert\r\npassivity. Therefore, he held that the chief thing in meritorious conduct\r\nis not so much the habit which has been created by God’s grace, as the act\r\nof will which makes use of the habit. In this way the grace of God is\r\nlooked upon as simply the general basis of meritorious conduct, or a mere\r\n_conditio sine qua non_, and the important thing is the act of will which\r\ncan make use of the otherwise passive habit. The process of\r\njustification—and it is to be remembered that the Schoolmen invariably\r\nlooked upon justification as a process by which a sinner was gradually\r\nmade into a righteous man and thoroughly and substantially changed—may\r\ntherefore be described as an infusion of divine grace which creates a\r\nhabit of the will towards love to God and to man; this is laid hold on by\r\nacts of the will, and there result positive acts of love towards God and\r\nman which are meritorious, and which gradually change a sinner into a\r\nrighteous person. This is the theory; but the theory is changed into\r\npractice by being exhibited in the framework of the Church provided to aid\r\nmen to appropriate the grace of God which is the basis for all. The\r\nobvious and easiest way to obtain that initial grace which is the\r\nstarting-point is by the sacraments, which are said to infuse grace—the\r\ngrace which is needed to make the start on the process of justification.\r\nGrace is infused to begin with in Baptism; and it is also infused from\r\ntime to tune in the Eucharist. If a man has been baptized, he has the\r\ninitial grace to start with; and he can get additions in the Eucharist.\r\nThat, according to the theory, is all that is needed to start the will on\r\nits path of meritorious conduct. But while this exhibits the ideal process\r\nof justification according to mediæval theology, it must be remembered\r\nthat there is mortal sin—sin which slays the new life begun in baptism—and\r\nthe sacrament which renews the life slain will be practically more\r\nimportant than the sacrament which first creates it. Hence practically the\r\nwhole process of the mediæval justification is best seen in the sacrament\r\nwhich renews the life slain by deadly sins. That sacrament is Penance; and\r\nthe theory and practice of justification is best exhibited in the\r\nSacrament of Penance. The good disposition of the will towards God is seen\r\nin confession; this movement towards God is complete when confession\r\nstimulated by the priest is finished; the performance of the meritorious\r\ngood works is seen in the penitent performing the “satisfactions,” or\r\ntasks imposed by the priest, of prayer, of almsgiving, of maceration;\r\nwhile the absolution announces that the process is complete, and that the\r\nsinner has become a righteous man and is in “a state of grace.”\r\n\r\nIn opposition to all this, Luther asserted that it was possible to go\r\nthrough all that process prescribed by the mediæval Church, embodying the\r\nScholastic theory of justification, without ever having the real sense of\r\npardon, or ever being comforted by the sense of the love of God. The\r\nfaith, however, which is the gift of God makes the believer see in the\r\nChrist Who is there before him a revelation of God’s Fatherly love which\r\ngives him the sense of pardon, and at the same time excites in him the\r\ndesire to do all manner of loving service. He is like the forgiven child\r\nwho is met with tenderness when punishment was expected, and in glad\r\nwonder resolves never to be naughty again—so natural and simple is the\r\nReformation thought. That thought, however, can be put much more formally.\r\nChemnitz expresses it thus:\r\n\r\n\r\n    “The main point of controversy at present agitated between us and\r\n    the Papists relates to the good works or new obedience of the\r\n    _regenerate_. They hold that the regenerate are justified through\r\n    that renewal which the Holy Spirit works _in_ them, and by means\r\n    of the _good works which proceed_ from that renewal. They hold\r\n    that the good works of the regenerate are the things on which they\r\n    can trust, when the hard question comes to be answered, whether we\r\n    be children of God and have been accepted to everlasting life. We\r\n    hold, on the other hand, that in true repentance faith lays hold\r\n    on and appropriates to itself _Christ’s satisfaction_, and in so\r\n    doing has something which it can oppose to the law’s accusations\r\n    at the bar of God, and thus bring it to pass that we should be\r\n    declared righteous.... It is indeed true that believers have\r\n    actual righteousness through their renewal by the Holy Spirit, but\r\n    inasmuch as that righteousness is imperfect and still impure by\r\n    reason of the flesh, all men cannot stand in God’s judgment with\r\n    it, nor on its account does God pronounce us righteous.”(403)\r\n\r\n\r\nHence we may say that the difference in the two ways of looking at the\r\nmatter may be exhibited in the answer to the question, What does faith lay\r\nhold on in true repentance? The Reformation answer is—(1) not on a\r\nmechanically complete confession made to a priest, nor on a due\r\nperformance of what the priest enjoins by way of satisfaction; but (2)\r\nonly on what God in Christ has done for us, which is seen in the life,\r\ndeath, and rising again of the Saviour.\r\n\r\nThe most striking differences between the Reformation and the mediæval\r\nconception of justification are:\r\n\r\n(1) The Reformation thought always looks at the comparative _imperfection_\r\nof the works of believers, while admitting that they are good works; the\r\nmediæval theologian, even when bidding men disregard the intrinsic value\r\nof their good works, always looks at the relative _perfection_ of these\r\nworks.\r\n\r\n(2) The Reformer had a much more concrete idea of God’s grace—it was\r\nsomething special, particular, unique—because he invariably regarded the\r\nreally good works which men can do from their relative imperfection; the\r\nmediæval theologian looked at the relative perfection of good works, and\r\nso could represent them as something congruous to the grace of God which\r\nwas not sharply distinguished from them.\r\n\r\n(3) These views led Luther and the Reformers to represent faith as not\r\nmerely the receptive organ for the reception and appropriation of\r\njustification through Christ, but, and in addition, as the active\r\ninstrument in all Christian life and work—faith is our life; while the\r\nmediæval theologians never attained this view of faith.\r\n\r\n(4) The Reformer believes that the act of faith in his justification\r\nthrough Christ is the basis of the believer’s assurance of his pardon and\r\nsalvation in spite of the painful and abiding sense of sin; while the\r\nmediæval theologian held that the divine sentence of acquittal which\r\nrestored a sinner to a state of grace resulted from the joint action of\r\nthe priest and the penitent in the Sacrament of Penance, and had to be\r\nrepeated intermittently.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 4. Holy Scripture.\r\n\r\n\r\nAll the Reformers of the sixteenth century, whether Luther, Zwingli, or\r\nCalvin, believed that in the Scriptures God spoke to them in the same way\r\nas He had done in earlier days to His prophets and Apostles. They believed\r\nthat if the common people had the Scriptures in a language which they\r\ncould understand, they could hear God speaking to them directly, and could\r\ngo to Him for comfort, warning, or instruction; and their description of\r\nwhat they meant by the Holy Scriptures is simply another way of saying\r\nthat all believers can have access to the very presence of God. The\r\nScriptures were therefore for them a personal rather than a dogmatic\r\nrevelation. They record the experience of a fellowship with God enjoyed by\r\nHis saints in past ages, which may still be shared in by the faithful. In\r\nBible history as the Reformers conceived it, we hear two voices—the voice\r\nof God speaking love to man, and the voice of the renewed man answering in\r\nfaith to God. This communion is no dead thing belonging to a bygone past;\r\nit may be shared here and now.\r\n\r\nBut the Reformation conception of Scripture is continually stated in such\r\na way as to deprive it of the eminently religious aspect that it had for\r\nmen of the sixteenth century. It is continually said that the Reformers\r\nplaced the Bible, an infallible Book, over-against an infallible Church;\r\nand transferred the _same kind_ of infallibility which had been supposed\r\nto belong to the Church to this book. In mediæval times, men accepted the\r\ndecisions of Popes and Councils as the last decisive utterance on all\r\nmatters of controversy in doctrine and morals; at the Reformation, the\r\nReformers, it is said, placed the Bible where these Popes and Councils had\r\nbeen, and declared that the last and final appeal was to be made to its\r\npages. This mode of stating the question has found its most concise\r\nexpression in the saying of Chillingworth, that “the Bible and the Bible\r\nalone is the religion of Protestants.” It is quite true that the Reformers\r\ndid set the authority of the Scriptures over against that of Popes and\r\nCouncils, and that Luther declared that “the common man,” “miller’s maid,”\r\nor “boy of nine” with the Bible knew more about divine truth than the Pope\r\nwithout the Bible; but this is not the whole truth, and is therefore\r\nmisleading. For Romanists and Protestants do not mean the same thing by\r\n_Scripture_, nor do they mean the same thing by _Infallibility_, and their\r\ndifferent use of the words is a most important part of the Reformation\r\nconception of Scripture.\r\n\r\nThis difference in the meaning of _Scripture_ is partly external and\r\npartly internal; and the latter is the more important of the two.\r\n\r\nThe _Scriptures_ to which the Romanist appeals include the Apocryphal\r\nBooks of the Old Testament; and the _Scriptures_ which are authoritative\r\nare not the books of the Old and New Testament in the original tongues,\r\nbut a translation into Latin known as the Vulgate of Pope Sixtus V. They\r\nare therefore a book to a large extent different from the one to which\r\nProtestants appeal.\r\n\r\nHowever important this external difference may be, it is nothing in\r\ncomparison with the internal difference; and yet the latter is continually\r\nforgotten by Protestants as well as by Roman Catholics in their arguments.\r\n\r\nTo understand it, one must remember that every mediæval theologian\r\ndeclared that the whole doctrinal system of his Church was based upon the\r\nScriptures of the Old and New Testaments. The Reformers did nothing\r\nunusual, nothing which was in opposition to the common practice of the\r\nmediæval Church in which they had been born, educated, and lived, when\r\nthey appealed to Scripture. Luther made his appeal with the same serene\r\nunconsciousness that anyone could gainsay him, as he did when he set the\r\nbeliever’s spiritual experience of the fact that he rested on Christ alone\r\nfor salvation against the proposal to sell pardon for money. His opponents\r\nnever attempted to challenge his right to make this appeal to Scripture—at\r\nleast at first. They made the same appeal themselves; they believed that\r\nthey were able to meet Scripture with Scripture. They were confident that\r\nthe authority appealed to—Scripture—would decide against Luther. It soon\r\nbecame apparent, however, that Luther had an unexpectedly firmer grasp of\r\nScripture than they had. This did not mean that he had a better memory for\r\ntexts. It was seen that Luther somehow was able to look at and use\r\nScripture as one transparent whole; while they looked on it as a\r\ncollection of fragmentary texts. This gave him and other Reformers a skill\r\nin the use of Scripture which their opponents began to feel that they were\r\ndeficient in. They felt that if they were to meet their opponents on equal\r\nterms they too must recognise a unity in Scripture. They did so by\r\ncreating an external and arbitrary unity by means of the dogmatic\r\ntradition of the mediæval Church. Hence the decree of the Council of\r\nTrent, which manufactured an artificial unity for Scripture by placing the\r\ndogmatic tradition of the Church alongside Scripture as an equal source of\r\nauthority. The reason why the Reformers found a natural unity in the\r\nBible, and why the Romanists had to construct an artificial one, lay, as\r\nwe shall see, in their different conceptions of what was meant by saving\r\nfaith.\r\n\r\nMediæval theologians looked at the Bible as a sort of spiritual law-book,\r\na storehouse of divinely communicated knowledge of doctrinal truths and\r\nrules for moral conduct—and nothing more.\r\n\r\nThe Reformers saw in it a new home for a new life within which they could\r\nhave intimate fellowship with God Himself—not merely knowledge about God,\r\nbut actual communion with Him.\r\n\r\nThere is one great difficulty attending the mediæval conception of the\r\nScriptures, that it does not seem applicable to a large part of them.\r\nThere is abundant material provided for the construction of doctrines and\r\nmoral rules; but that is only a portion of what is contained in the\r\nScriptures. The Bible contains long lists of genealogies, chapters which\r\ncontain little else than a description of temple furniture, stories of\r\nsimple human life, and details of national history. The mediæval\r\ntheologian had either to discard altogether a large part of the Bible or\r\nto transform it somehow into doctrinal and moral teaching. The latter\r\nalternative was chosen, and the instrument of transformation was the\r\nthought of the various senses in Scripture which plays such a prominent\r\npart in every mediæval statement of the nature and uses of the revelation\r\nof God contained in the Bible.(404) No one can deny that a book, where\r\ninstruction is frequently given in parables, or by means of aphorisms and\r\nproverbial sayings, must contain many passages which have different\r\nsenses. It may be admitted, to use Origen’s illustrations, that the grain\r\nof mustard seed is, _literally_, an actual seed; _morally_, faith in the\r\nindividual believer; and, _allegorically_, the kingdom of God;(405) or,\r\nthough this is more doubtful, that the little foxes are, literally, cubs;\r\nmorally, sins in the individual heart; and, allegorically, heresies which\r\ndistract and spoil the Church.(406) But to say that every detail of\r\npersonal or national life in the Old Testament or New is merely dead\r\nhistory, of no spiritual value until it has been transformed into a\r\ndoctrinal truth or a moral rule by the application of the theory of the\r\nfourfold sense in Scripture, is to destroy the historical character of\r\nrevelation altogether, and, besides, to introduce complete uncertainty\r\nabout what any passage was really meant to declare. The use of a fourfold\r\nsense—_literal_, _moral_, _allegorical_, and _anagogic_—enables the reader\r\nto draw any meaning he pleases from any portion of Scripture.\r\n\r\nWhile mediæval theologians, by their bewildering fourfold sense, made it\r\nalmost hopeless to know precisely what the Bible actually taught, another\r\nidea of theirs made it essential to salvation that men should attain to an\r\nabsolutely correct statement of what the Scriptures did reveal about God\r\nand man and the relation between them. They held that faith—the faith\r\nwhich saves—was not trust in a person, but assent to correct propositions\r\nabout God, the universe, and the soul of man; and the saving character of\r\nthe assent depended on the correctness of the propositions assented to. It\r\nis the submission of the intellect to certain propositional statements\r\nwhich are either seen to be correct or are accepted as being so because\r\nguaranteed in some supernatural way. Infallibility is looked upon as that\r\nwhich can guarantee the perfect correctness of propositions about God and\r\nman in their relations to each other.\r\n\r\n_If_ it be necessary to employ the fourfold sense to confuse the plain\r\nmeaning of the greater portion of Scripture, and _if_ salvation depends on\r\narriving at a perfectly correct intellectual apprehension of abstract\r\ntruths contained somewhere in the Bible, then Lacordaire’s sarcastic\r\nreference to the Protestant conception of Scripture is not out of place.\r\nHe says: “What kind of a religion is that which saves men by aid of a\r\nbook? God has given the book, but He has not guaranteed your private\r\ninterpretation of it. What guarantee have you that your thoughts do not\r\nshove aside God’s ideas? The heathen carves himself a god out of wood or\r\nmarble; the Protestant carves his out of the Bible. If there be a true\r\nreligion on earth, it must be of the most _serene_ and unmistakable\r\nauthority.”(407) We need not wonder at John Nathin saying to his perplexed\r\npupil in the Erfurt Convent: “Brother Martin, let the Bible alone; read\r\nthe old teachers; reading the Bible simply breeds unrest.”(408) We can\r\nsympathise with some of the earlier printers of the German Vulgate when\r\nthey inserted in their prefaces that readers must be careful to understand\r\nthe contents of the volume in the way declared by the Church.(409) Men who\r\nwent to the Bible might go wrong, and it was spiritual death to make any\r\nmistake; but all who simply assented to the interpretation of the Bible\r\ngiven in the Church’s theology were kept right and had the true or saving\r\nfaith. Such was the mediæval idea.\r\n\r\nBut all this made it impossible to find in the Bible a means of communion\r\nwith God. Between the God Who had revealed Himself there and man, the\r\nmediæval theologian, perhaps unconsciously at first, had placed what he\r\ncalled the “Church,” but what really was the opinions of accredited\r\ntheologians confirmed by decisions of Councils or Popes. The “Church” had\r\nbarred the way of access to the mind and heart of God in the Scriptures by\r\ninterposing its authoritative method of interpretation between the\r\nbeliever and the Bible, as it had interposed the priesthood between the\r\nsinner and the redeeming Saviour.\r\n\r\nJust as the Reformers had opposed their personal experience of pardon won\r\nby throwing themselves on the mercy of God revealed in Christ to the\r\nintervention of the Church between them and God, so they controverted this\r\nidea of the Scriptures by the personal experience of what the Bible had\r\nbeen to them. They had felt and known that the personal God, Who had made\r\nthem and redeemed them, was speaking to them in this Book, and was there\r\nmaking manifest familiarly His power and His willingness to save. The\r\nspeech was sometimes obscure, but they read on and lighted on other\r\npassages which were plainer, and they made the easier explain the more\r\ndifficult. The “common” man perhaps could not understand it all, nor fit\r\nall the sayings of Scripture into a connected whole of intellectual truth;\r\nbut all, plain men and theologians alike, could hear their Father’s voice,\r\nlearn their Redeemer’s purpose, and have faith in their Lord’s promises.\r\nIt was a good thing to put text to text and build a system of Protestant\r\ndivinity to which their intellects could assent; but it was not essential.\r\nSaving faith was not intellectual assent at all. It was simple trust—the\r\ntrust of a child—in their Father’s promises, which were Yea and Amen in\r\nChrist Jesus. The one essential thing was to hear and obey the personal\r\nGod speaking to them as He had spoken all down through the ages to His\r\npeople, promising His salvation now in direct words, now in pictures of\r\nHis dealings with a favoured man or a chosen people. No detail of life was\r\ndead history; for it helped to fill the picture of communion between God\r\nand His people. The picture was itself a promise that what had been in the\r\npast would be renewed in their own experience of fellowship with a\r\ngracious God, if only they had the same faith which these saints of the\r\nOld and New Testaments enjoyed.\r\n\r\nWith these thoughts burning in their hearts, the Bible could not be to the\r\nReformers what it had been to the mediæval theologians. God was speaking\r\nto them in it as a man speaks to his fellows. The simple historical sense\r\nwas the important one in the great majority of passages. The Scripture was\r\nmore than a storehouse of doctrines and moral rules. It was over and above\r\nthe record and picture of the blessed experience which God’s saints have\r\nhad in fellowship with their covenant God since the first revelation of\r\nthe Promise. So they made haste to translate the Bible into all languages\r\nin order to place it in the hands of every man, and said that the “common\r\nman” with the Bible in his hands (with God speaking to him) could know\r\nmore about the way of salvation than Pope or Councils without the\r\nScriptures.\r\n\r\nThe change of view which separated the Reformers from mediæval theologians\r\nalmost amounted to a rediscovery of Scripture; and it was effected by\r\ntheir conception of faith. Saving faith was for them _personal trust_ in a\r\n_personal Saviour_ Who had manifested in His life and work the Fatherly\r\nmercy of God. This was not a mere theological definition; it was a\r\ndescription of an experience which they knew that they had lived. It made\r\nthem see that the word of God was a personal and not a dogmatic\r\nrevelation; that the real meaning in it was that God Himself was there\r\nbehind every word of it,—not an abstract truth, but a personal Father. On\r\nthe one side, on the divine, there was God pouring out His whole heart and\r\nrevealing the inmost treasures of His righteousness and love in Christ the\r\nIncarnate Word; on the other side, on the human, there was the believing\r\nsoul looking straight through all works and all symbols and all words to\r\nChrist Himself, united to Him by faith in the closest personal union. Such\r\na blessed experience—the feeling of direct fellowship between the believer\r\nand God Incarnate, of a communion such as exists between two loving human\r\nsouls, brought about by the twofold stream of God’s personal word coming\r\ndown, and man’s personal faith going up to God—could not fail to give an\r\nentirely new conception of Scripture. The mediæval Church looked on the\r\nJesus Christ revealed in Scripture as a Teacher sent from God; and\r\nrevelation was for them above all things an imparting of speculative\r\ntruth. To the Reformers the chief function of Scripture was to bring Jesus\r\nChrist near us; and as Jesus always fills the full sphere of God to them,\r\nthe chief end of Scripture is to bring God near _me_. It is the direct\r\nmessage of God’s love to _me_,—not doctrine, but promise (for apart from\r\npromise, as Luther said unweariedly, faith does not exist); not display of\r\nGod’s thoughts, but of God Himself as _my_ God. This manifestation of God,\r\nwhich is recorded for us in the Scriptures, took place in an historical\r\nprocess coming to its fullest and highest in the incarnation and\r\nhistorical work of Christ, and the record of the manifestation has been\r\nframed so as to include everything necessary to enable us to understand\r\nthe declaration of God’s will in its historical context and in its\r\nhistorical manifestation. “Let no pious Christian,” says Luther, “stumble\r\nat the simple word and story that meet him so often in Scripture.” These\r\nare never the dead histories of the mediæval theologian,—events which have\r\nsimply taken place and concern men no more. They tell how God dealt with\r\nHis faithful people in ages past, and they are promises of how He will act\r\ntowards us now. “Abraham’s history is precious,” he says, “because it is\r\nfilled so full of God’s Word, with which all that befell him is so adorned\r\nand so fair, and because God goes everywhere before him with His Word,\r\npromising, commanding, comforting, warning, that we may verily see that\r\nAbraham was God’s special trusty friend. Let us mirror ourselves, then, in\r\nthis holy father Abraham, who walks not in gold and velvet, but girded,\r\ncrowned, and clothed with divine light, that is, with God’s Word.” The\r\nsimplest Bible stories, even geographical and architectural details, may\r\nand do give us the sidelights necessary to complete the manifestation of\r\nGod to His people.\r\n\r\nThe question now arises, Where and in what are we to recognise the\r\ninfallibility and authoritative character of Scripture? It is manifest\r\nthat the ideas attaching to these words must change with the changed\r\nconception of the essential character of that Scripture to which they\r\nbelong. Nor can the question be discussed apart from the Reformation idea\r\nof saving faith; for the two thoughts of Scripture and saving faith always\r\ncorrespond. In mediæval theology they are always primarily intellectual\r\nand prepositional; in Reformation thinking, they are always in the first\r\ninstance experimental and personal. In describing the authoritative\r\ncharacter of Scripture, the Reformers always insisted that its recognition\r\nwas awakened in believers by that operation which they called the witness\r\nof the Holy Spirit (_Testimonium Spiritus Sancti_). Just as God Himself\r\nmakes us know and feel the sense of pardon in an inward experience by a\r\nfaith which is His own work, so they believed that by an operation of the\r\nsame Spirit, believers were enabled to recognise that God Himself is\r\nspeaking to us authoritatively in and through the words of Scripture.\r\n\r\nTheir view of what is meant by the authority and infallibility of\r\nScripture cannot be seen apart from what they taught about the relation\r\nbetween Scripture and the word of God. They have all the same general\r\nconception, however they may differ in details in their statement. If\r\nLuther, as his wont was, speaks more trenchantly, and Calvin writes with a\r\nclearer vision of the consequences which must follow from his assertions,\r\nboth have the same great thought before them.\r\n\r\nThe Reformers drew a distinction between the word of God and the Scripture\r\nwhich contains or presents that word. This distinction was real and not\r\nmerely formal; it was more than the difference between the word of God and\r\nthe word of God written; and important consequences were founded upon it.\r\nIf the use of metaphor be allowed, the word of God is to the Scripture as\r\nthe soul is to the body. Luther believed that while the word of God was\r\npresented in every part of Scripture, some portions make it much more\r\nevident. He instances the Gospel and First Epistle of St. John, the\r\nEpistles of St. Paul, especially those to the Romans, to the Galatians,\r\nand to the Ephesians, and the First Epistle of St. Peter.(410) He declares\r\nthat if Christians possessed no other books besides those, the way of\r\nsalvation would be perfectly clear. He adds elsewhere that the word of God\r\nshines forth with special clearness in the Psalms, which he called the\r\nBible within the Bible.\r\n\r\nLuther says that the word of God may be described in the phrase of St.\r\nPaul, “the Gospel of God, which He promised afore by His Prophets in the\r\nHoly Scriptures, concerning His Son, who was born of the seed of David\r\naccording to the flesh, who was declared to be the Son of God with power,\r\naccording to the spirit of holiness, by the resurrection of the\r\ndead.”(411) Calvin calls it “the spiritual teaching, the gate, as it were,\r\nby which we enter into His heavenly kingdom,” “a mirror in which faith\r\nbeholds God,” and “that wherein He utters unto us His mercy in Christ, and\r\nassureth us of His love toward us.”(412) The Scots Confession calls it the\r\nrevelation of the Promise “quhilk as it was repeated and made mair clear\r\nfrom time to time; so was it imbraced with joy, and maist constantlie\r\nreceived of al the faithful.”(413) And Zwingli declares it to be “that our\r\nLord Jesus Christ, the very Son of God, has revealed to us the will of the\r\nHeavenly Father, and, with His innocence, has redeemed us from\r\ndeath.”(414) It is the sum of God’s commands, threatenings, and promises,\r\naddressed to our faith, and above all the gospel offer of Christ to us.\r\nThis word of God need not take the form of direct exhortation; it may be\r\nrecognised in the simple histories of men or of nations recorded in the\r\nScripture.\r\n\r\nThis true and real distinction between the word of God and Scripture may\r\neasily be perverted to something which all the Reformers would have\r\nrepudiated. It must not be explained by the common mystical illustration\r\nof kernel and husk, which husk (the record) may be thrown away when the\r\nkernel (the word) has been once reached and laid hold of. Nor can it be\r\nused to mean that one part of the Bible is the word of God and that\r\nanother is not. The Reformers uniformly teach that the substance of _all_\r\nScripture is the word of God, and that what is no part of the record of\r\nthe word of God is not Scripture. Finally, the distinction between the two\r\nneed not prevent us saying that the Scripture is the word of God. Luther\r\nis very peremptory about this. He says that he is ready to discuss\r\ndifferences with any opponent who admits that the evangelical writings are\r\nthe word of God; but that if this be denied he will refuse to argue; for\r\nwhere is the good of reasoning with anyone who denies first principles?\r\n(_prima principia_)(415) Only it must be clearly understood that the\r\ncopula _is_ does not express logical identity, but some such relation as\r\ncan be more exactly rendered by _contains_, _presents_, _conveys_,\r\n_records_,—all of which phrases are used in the writings of Reformers or\r\nin the creeds of the Reformation Churches. The main thing to remember is\r\nthat the distinction is not to be made use of to deny to the substance of\r\nScripture those attributes of authority and infallibility which belong to\r\nthe word of God.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, there is a vital religious interest in the distinction.\r\nIn the first place it indicates what is meant by the infallibility of\r\nScripture, and in the second it enables us to distinguish between the\r\ndivine and the human elements in the Bible.\r\n\r\nThe authoritative character and infallibility belong really and primarily\r\nto the word of God, and only secondarily to the Scriptures,—to Scripture\r\nonly because it is the record which contains, presents, or conveys the\r\nword of God. It is this word of God, this personal manifestation to us for\r\nour salvation of God in His promises, which is authoritative and\r\ninfallible; and Scripture shares these attributes only in so far as it is\r\na vehicle of spiritual truth. It is the unanimous declaration of the\r\nReformers that Scripture is Scripture because it gives us that knowledge\r\nof God and of His will which is necessary for salvation; because it\r\npresents to the eye of faith God Himself personally manifesting Himself in\r\nChrist. It is this presentation of God Himself and of His will for our\r\nsalvation which is infallible and authoritative. But this manifestation of\r\nGod Himself is something spiritual, and is to be apprehended by a\r\nspiritual faculty which is faith, and the Reformers and the Confessions of\r\nthe Reformation do not recognise any infallibility or divine authority\r\nwhich is otherwise apprehended than by faith. If this be so, the\r\ninfallibility is of quite another kind from that described by mediæval\r\ntheologians or modern Roman Catholics, and it is also very different from\r\nwhat many modern Protestants attribute to the Scriptures when they do not\r\ndistinguish them from the word of God. With the mediæval theologian\r\ninfallibility was something which guaranteed the perfect correctness of\r\nabstract propositions; with some modern Protestants it consists in the\r\nconception that the record contains not even the smallest error in word or\r\ndescription of fact—in its inerrancy. But neither inerrancy nor the\r\ncorrectness of abstract propositions is apprehended by faith in the\r\nReformers’ sense of that word; they are matters of fact, to be accepted or\r\nrejected by the ordinary faculties of man. The infallibility and authority\r\nwhich need faith to perceive them are, and must be, something very\r\ndifferent; they produce the conviction that in the manifestation of God in\r\nHis word there lies infallible power to save. This is given, all the\r\nReformers say, by the Witness of the Spirit; “the true kirk alwaies heares\r\nand obeyis the voice of her awin spouse and pastor.”(416) Calvin discusses\r\nthe authority and credibility of Scripture in his _Institutio_, and says:\r\n“Let it be considered, then, as an undeniable truth that they who have\r\nbeen inwardly taught of the Spirit feel an entire acquiescence in the\r\nScripture, and that it is self-authenticated, carrying with it its own\r\nevidence, and ought not to be made the subject of demonstration and\r\narguments from reason; but that it obtains the credit which it deserves\r\nwith us by the testimony of the Spirit.”(417) This is a religious\r\nconception of infallibility very different from the mediæval or the modern\r\nRomanist.\r\n\r\nThe distinction between the word of God and Scripture also serves to\r\ndistinguish between the divine and the human elements in Scripture, and to\r\ngive each its proper place.\r\n\r\nInfallibility and divine authority belong to the sphere of faith and of\r\nthe witness of the Spirit, and, therefore, to that personal manifestation\r\nof God and of His will toward us which is conveyed or presented to us in\r\nevery part of Scripture. But this manifestation is given in a course of\r\nevents which are part of human history, in lives of men and peoples, in a\r\nrecord which in outward form is like other human writings. If every part\r\nof Scripture is divine, every part of it is also human. The supernatural\r\nreality is incased in human realities. To apprehend the former, faith\r\nillumined by the Holy Spirit is necessary; but it is sufficient to use the\r\nordinary methods of research to learn the credibility of the history in\r\nScripture. When the Reformers distinguished between the word of God and\r\nScripture which conveys or presents it, and when they declared that the\r\nauthority and infallibility of that word belonged to the region of faith,\r\nthey made that authority and infallibility altogether independent of\r\nquestions that might be raised about the human agencies through which the\r\nbook came into its present shape. It is not a matter belonging to the\r\nregion of faith when the books which record the word of God were written,\r\nor by whom, or in what style, or how often they were edited or re-edited.\r\nIt is not a matter for faith whether incidents happened in one country or\r\nin another; whether the account of Job be literal history, or a poem based\r\non old traditions in which the author has used the faculty of imagination\r\nto illustrate the problems of God’s providence and man’s probation;\r\nwhether genealogical tables give the names of men or of countries and\r\npeoples. All these and the like matters belong to the human side of the\r\nrecord. No special illumination of faith is needed to apprehend and\r\nunderstand them. They are matters for the ordinary faculties of man, and\r\nsubject to ordinary human investigation. Luther availed himself freely of\r\nthe liberty thus given. He never felt himself bound to accept the\r\ntraditional ideas about the extent of the canon, the authorship of the\r\nbooks of the Bible, or even about the credibility of some of the things\r\nrecorded. He said, speaking about Genesis, “What though Moses never wrote\r\nit?”(418) It was enough for him that the book was there and that he could\r\nread it. He thought that the Books of Kings were more worthy of credit\r\nthan the Books of Chronicles;(419) and he believed that the prophets had\r\nnot always given the kings of Israel the best political advice.(420)\r\n\r\nBut while the Bible is human literature, and as such may be and must be\r\nsubjected to the same tests which are applied to ordinary literature, it\r\nis the record of the revelation of God, and has been carefully guarded and\r\nprotected by God. This thought always enters into the conception which the\r\nReformers had of Scripture. They speak of the singular care and providence\r\nof God which has preserved the Scriptures in such a way that His people\r\nalways have a full and unmistakable declaration in them of His mind and\r\nwill for their salvation. This idea for ever forbids a careless or\r\nirreverent biblical criticism, sheltering itself under the liberty of\r\ndealing with the records of revelation. No one can say beforehand how much\r\nor how little of the historic record is essential to preserve the faith of\r\nthe Church; but every devout Christian desires to have it in large\r\nabundance. No one can plead the liberty which the principles of the\r\nReformers secure for dealing with the record of Scripture as a\r\njustification in taking a delight in reducing to a minimum the historical\r\nbasis of the Christian faith. Careless or irreverent handling of the text\r\nof Holy Scripture is what all the Reformers abhorred.(421)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 5. The Person of Christ.\r\n\r\n\r\n“No one can deny,” said Luther, “that we hold, believe, sing, and confess\r\nall things in correspondence with the Apostles’ Creed, the faith of the\r\nold Church, that we make nothing new therein nor add anything thereto, and\r\nin this way we belong to the old Church and are one with it.” Both the\r\nAugsburg Confession and the Schmalkald Articles begin with restating the\r\ndoctrines of the old Catholic Church as these are given in the Apostles’,\r\nNicene, and Athanasian Creeds, the two latter being always regarded by\r\nLuther as explanatory of the Apostles’ Creed. His criticism of theological\r\ndoctrines was always confined to the theories introduced by the Schoolmen,\r\nand to the perversion of the old doctrines of the Church introduced in\r\nmediæval times mainly to bring these doctrines into conformity with the\r\nprinciples of the philosophy of Aristotle. He brought two charges against\r\nthe Scholastic Theology. It was, he insisted, committed to the idea of\r\nwork-righteousness; whatever occasional protest might be made against the\r\nconception, he maintained that this thought of work-righteousness was so\r\ninterwoven with its warp and woof that the whole must be swept away ere\r\nthe old and true Christian Theology could be rediscovered. He also\r\ndeclared it was sophistry; and by that he meant that it played with the\r\noutsides of doctrine, asked and solved questions which had nothing to do\r\nwith real Christian theology, that the imposing intellectual edifice was\r\nhollow within, that its deity was not the God and Father revealed in Jesus\r\nChrist, but the unknown God, the God who could never be revealed by\r\nmetaphysics larded with detached texts of Scripture, the abstract entity\r\nof pagan philosophy. With an unerring instinct he fastened on the\r\nScholastic devotion to Aristotle as the reason why what professed to be\r\nChristian theology had been changed into something else. Scholastic\r\nPhilosophy or Theology (for the two are practically the same) defined\r\nitself as the attempt to reconcile _faith_ and _reason_, and the\r\ndefinition has been generally accepted. Verbally it is correct; really it\r\nis very misleading from the meanings attached to the words faith and\r\nreason. With the Schoolmen, faith in this contrast between faith and\r\nreason meant the sum of patristic teaching about the verities of the\r\nChristian religion extracted by the Fathers from the Holy Scriptures; and\r\nreason meant the sum of philosophical principles extracted from the\r\nwritings of ancient philosophers, and especially from Aristotle. The great\r\nSchoolmen conceived it to be their task to construct a system of Christian\r\nPhilosophy by combining patristic doctrinal conclusions with the\r\nconclusions of human reasoning which they believed to be given in their\r\nhighest form in the writings of the ancient Grecian sages. They actually\r\nused the conceptions of the Fathers as material to give body to the forms\r\nof thought found ready made for them in the speculations of Aristotle and\r\nPlato. The Christian material was moulded to fit the pagan forms, and in\r\nconsequence lost its most essentially Christian characteristics. One can\r\nsee how the most evangelical of the Schoolmen, Thomas Aquinas, tries in\r\nvain to break through the meshes of the Aristotelian net in his\r\ndiscussions on merit and satisfaction in his _Summa Theologiæ_.(422) He\r\nhad to start from the thought of God as (1) the Absolute, and (2) as the\r\n_Primum Movens_, the _Causa efficiens prima_, the _Intelligens a quo omnes\r\nres naturales ordinantur in finem_—conceptions which can never imprison\r\nwithout practically destroying the vision of the Father who has revealed\r\nHimself in the Saviour Jesus Christ. His other starting-point, that man is\r\nto be described as the possessor of free will in the Aristotelian sense of\r\nthe term, will never contain the Christian doctrine of man’s complete\r\ndependence on God in his salvation. It inevitably led to\r\nwork-righteousness. This was the “sophistry” Luther protested against and\r\nwhich he swept away.\r\n\r\nHe then claimed that he stood where the old Catholic Church had taken\r\nstand, that his theology like its was rooted in the faith of God as\r\nTrinity and in the belief in the Person of Christ, the Revealer of God.\r\nThe old theology had nothing to do with Mariolatry or saint worship; it\r\nrevered the triune God, and Jesus Christ His Son and man’s Saviour. Luther\r\ncould join hands with Athanasius across twelve centuries. He had done a\r\nwork not unlike that of the great Alexandrian. His rejection of the\r\nScholastic Aristotelianism may be compared with Athanasius’ refusal to\r\nallow the Logos theology any longer to confuse the Christian doctrines of\r\nGod and the Person of Christ. Both believed that in all thinking about God\r\nthey ought to keep their eyes fixed upon His redemptive work manifested in\r\nthe historical Christ. Athanasius, like Luther, brought theology back to\r\nreligion from “sophistry,” and had for his starting-point an inward\r\nreligious experience that his Redeemer was the God who made heaven and\r\nearth. The great leaders in the ancient Church, Luther believed, held as\r\nhe did that to have conceptions about God, to construct a real Christian\r\ntheology, it was necessary first of all to know God Himself, and that He\r\nwas only to be known through the Lord Jesus Christ. He had gone through\r\nthe same experience as they had done; he could fully sympathise with them,\r\nand could appropriate the expressions in which they had described and\r\ncrystallised what they had felt and known, and that without paying much\r\nattention to the niceties of technical language. These doctrines had not\r\nbeen dead formulas to them, but the expression of a living faith. He could\r\ntherefore take the old dogmas and make them live again in an age in which\r\nit seemed as if they had lost all their vitality.\r\n\r\n\r\n    “From the time of Athanasius,” says Harnack, “there had been no\r\n    theologian who had given so much living power for faith to the\r\n    doctrine of the Godhead of Christ as Luther did; since the time of\r\n    Cyril, no teacher had arisen in the Church for whom the mystery of\r\n    the union of the two natures in Christ was so full of comfort as\r\n    for Luther—‘I have a better provider than all angels are: he lies\r\n    in the cradle and hangs on the breast of a virgin, but sits,\r\n    nevertheless, at the right hand of the almighty father’; no mystic\r\n    philosopher of antiquity spoke with greater conviction and delight\r\n    of the sacred nourishment in the Eucharist. The German reformer\r\n    restored life to the formulas of Greek Christianity: he gave them\r\n    back to faith.”(423)\r\n\r\n\r\nBut if Luther accepted the old formulas describing the Nature of God and\r\nthe Person of Christ, he did so in a thoroughly characteristic way. He had\r\nno liking for theological technical terms, though he confessed that it was\r\nnecessary to use them. He disliked the old term _homoousios_ to describe\r\nthe relation between the Persons in the Trinity, and preferred the word\r\n“oneness”;(424) he even disliked the term Trinity, or at least its German\r\nequivalents, Dreifaltigkeit or Dreiheit—they were not good German words,\r\nhe said;(425) he called the technical terms used in the old creeds\r\n_vocabula mathematica_;(426) he was careful to avoid using them in his\r\nShort and even in his Long Catechism. But Jesus Christ was for him the\r\nmirror of the Fatherly heart of God, and therefore was God; God Himself\r\nwas the only Comforter to bring rest to the human soul, and the Holy\r\nSpirit was God; and the old creeds confessed One God, Father, Son, and\r\nHoly Ghost, and the confession contented him whatever words were used.\r\nBesides, he rejoiced to place himself side by side with the Christians of\r\nancient days, who trusted God in Christ and were free from the\r\n“sophistries” of the Schoolmen.\r\n\r\nAlthough Luther accepted, honestly and joyfully, the old theology about\r\nGod and the Person of Christ, he put a new and richer meaning into it.\r\nLuther lets us see over and over again that he believed that the only\r\nthing worth considering in theology was the divine work of Christ and the\r\nexperience that we have of it through faith. He did not believe that we\r\nhave any real knowledge of God outside these limits. Beyond them there is\r\nthe unknown God of philosophical paganism, the God whom Jews, Turks,\r\npagans, and nominal Christians ignorantly worship. In order to know God it\r\nis necessary to know Him through the Jesus Christ of history. Hence with\r\nLuther, Christ fills the whole sphere of God: “He that hath seen Me hath\r\nseen the Father,” and conversely: “He that hath not seen Me hath not seen\r\nthe Father.” The historical Jesus Christ is for Luther the revealer and\r\nthe only revealer of the Father. The revelation is given in the wonderful\r\nexperience of faith in which Jesus compels us to see God in Him—the whole\r\nof God, Who has kept nothing back which He could have given us. It is very\r\ndoubtful whether the framers of the old creeds ever grasped this thought.\r\nThe great expounder of the old theology, Augustine, certainly did not. The\r\nfailure to enter into it showed itself not merely in the doctrine of God,\r\nbut also in the theories of grace. With Luther all theology is really\r\nChristology; he knew no other God than the God Who had manifested Himself\r\nin the historical Christ, and made us see in the miracle of faith that He\r\nis our salvation. This at once simplifies all Christian theology and cuts\r\nit clearly away from that Scholastic which Luther called “sophistry.” Why\r\nneed Christians puzzle themselves over the Eternal Something which is not\r\nthe world when they have the Father? On the old theology the work of\r\nChrist was practically limited to procuring the forgiveness of sins. There\r\nit ended and other gracious operations of God began—operations of grace.\r\nSo there grew the complex system of expiations, and satisfactions, of\r\nmagical sacraments and saints’ intercessions. These were all at once swept\r\naway when the whole God was seen revealed in Christ in the vision of faith\r\nand nowhere else.\r\n\r\nLike Athanasius, Luther found his salvation in the Deity of Christ.\r\n\r\n\r\n    “We must have a Saviour Who is more than a saint or an angel; for\r\n    if He were no more, better and greater than these, there were no\r\n    helping us. But if he be God, then the treasure is so ponderous\r\n    that it outweighs and lifts away sin and death; and not only so,\r\n    but also gives eternal life. This is our Christian faith, and\r\n    therefore we rightly confess: ‘I believe in Jesus Christ His only\r\n    Son, our Lord, Who was born of Mary, suffered and died.’ By this\r\n    faith hold fast, and though heathen and heretic are ever so wise\r\n    thou shalt be blessed.”(427)\r\n\r\n\r\nHe repeats this over and over again. If we cannot say God died for us, if\r\nit was only a man who suffered on the cross, then we are lost, was\r\nLuther’s firmest conviction; and the thought of the Divinity of Christ\r\nmeant more to Luther than it did to previous theologians. The old theology\r\nhad described the two Natures in the One Person of the God-man in such a\r\nway as to suggest that the only function of the Divine was to give to the\r\nhuman work of Christ the importance necessary to effect salvation. Luther\r\nalways refused to adopt this limited way of regarding the Divinity of the\r\nSaviour. He did not refuse to adopt and use the _phraseology_ of his\r\npredecessors. Like them, he spoke of the two Natures in the One Person of\r\nChrist. But it is plain from his expositions of the Creed, and from his\r\ncriticisms of the current theological terminology, that he did not like\r\nthe expression. He thought that it suggested an idea that was wrong, and\r\nthat had to be guarded against. He says that we must beware of thinking as\r\nif the deity and humanity in Christ are so externally united that we may\r\nlook at the one apart from the other.\r\n\r\n\r\n    “This is the first principle and most excellent article how Christ\r\n    is the Father: that we are not to doubt that whatsoever the man\r\n    says and does is reckoned and must be reckoned as said and done in\r\n    heaven for all angels; in the world for all rulers; in hell for\r\n    all devils; in the heart for every evil conscience and all secret\r\n    thoughts. For if we are certain of this: that what Jesus thinks,\r\n    speaks, and wills the Father also wills, then I defy all that may\r\n    fight against me. For here in Christ have I the Father’s heart and\r\n    will.”(428)\r\n\r\n\r\nHe brings the thought of the Person of Christ into the closest relation to\r\nour personal experience. It is not simply a doctrine—an intellectual\r\nsomething outside us. It is part of that blessed experience which is\r\ncalled Justification by Faith. It is inseparably connected with the\r\nrecognition that we are not saved by means of the good deeds which we can\r\ndo, but solely by the work of Christ. It is what makes us cease all\r\nwork-righteousness and trust in God alone as He has revealed Himself in\r\nChrist. When we know and feel that it is God who is working for us, then\r\nwe instinctively cease trying to think that we can work out our own\r\nsalvation.(429) Hence the Person of Christ can never be a mere doctrine\r\nfor the true Christian to be inquired about by the intellect. It is\r\nsomething which we carry about with us as part of our lives.\r\n\r\n\r\n    “To know Christ in the true way means to know that He died for us,\r\n    that He piled our sins upon Himself, so that we hold all our own\r\n    affairs as nothing and let them all go, and cling only to the\r\n    faith that Christ has given Himself for us, and that His\r\n    sufferings and piety and virtues are all mine. When I know this I\r\n    must hold Him dear in return, for I must be loving to such a man.”\r\n\r\n\r\nHe insists on the human interest that the Man Jesus Christ has for us, and\r\ndeclares that we must take as much interest in His whole life on earth as\r\nin that of our closest friend.\r\n\r\nPerhaps it ought to be added, although what has been said implies it, that\r\nLuther always approached the Person of Christ from his mediatorial work,\r\nand not from any previously thought out ideas of what Godhead must be, and\r\nwhat manhood must be, and how they can be united. He begins with the\r\nmediatorial and saving work of Christ as that is revealed in the blessed\r\nexperience which faith, the gift of God, creates. He rises from, the\r\noffice to the Person, and does not descend from the Person to the office.\r\n“Christ is not called Christ because He has the two Natures. What does\r\nthat matter to me? He bears this glorious and comforting name because of\r\nHis Office and Work which He has undertaken.”(430) It is in this way that\r\nHe becomes the Saviour and the Redeemer.\r\n\r\nIt can scarcely be said that all the Reformers worked out the conception\r\nof the Person of Christ in the same way as Luther, although almost all\r\nthese thoughts can be found in Calvin, but the overshadowing conception is\r\nalways present to their mind—Christ fills the full sphere of God. That is\r\nthe characteristic of Reformation thought and of Reformation piety, and\r\nappears everywhere in the writings of the Reformers and in the worship and\r\nrites of the Reformed Church. To go into the matter exhaustively would\r\nnecessitate more space than can be given; but the following instances may\r\nbe taken as indicating the universal thought.\r\n\r\n1. The Reformers swept away every contemplation of intercessors who were\r\nsupposed to share with our Lord the procuring of pardon and salvation, and\r\nthey declared against all attempts to distinguish between various kinds of\r\nworship which could only lead pious souls astray from the one worship due\r\nto God in Christ. Such subtle distinctions, says Calvin, as _latria_,\r\n_doulia_, and _hyperdoulia_ are neither known nor present to the minds of\r\nthose who prostrate themselves before images until the world has become\r\nfull of idolatry as crude and plain as that of the ancient Egyptians,\r\nwhich all the prophets continuously denounced: they can only mislead, and\r\nought to be discarded. They actually suggest to worshippers to pass by\r\nJesus Christ, the only Mediator, and betake themselves to some patron who\r\nhas struck their fancy. They bring it about that the Divine Offices are\r\ndistributed among the saints as if they had been appointed colleagues to\r\nour Lord Jesus Christ; and they are made to do His work, while He Himself\r\nis kept in the background like some ordinary person in a crowd. They are\r\nresponsible for the fact that hymns are sung in public worship in which\r\nthe saints are lauded with every blessing just as if they were colleagues\r\nof God.(431)\r\n\r\nIn conformity with these thoughts, the Confessions of the Reformation all\r\nagree in reprobating prayers to the saints. The Augsburg Confession says:\r\n\r\n\r\n    “The Scripture teacheth not to invoke saints, nor to ask the help\r\n    of saints, because it propoundeth to us one Christ, the Mediator,\r\n    Propitiatory, High Priest, and Intercessor. This Christ is to be\r\n    invocated, and He hath promised that He will hear our prayers, and\r\n    liketh this worship, to wit, that He be invocated in all\r\n    afflictions. ‘If any man sin, we have an advocate with God, Jesus\r\n    Christ the righteous’ (1 John ii. 1).”(432)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Second Helvetic Confession, in its fifth chapter, entitled, _Regarding\r\nthe adoration, worship, and invocation of God through the One Mediator,\r\nJesus Christ_, lays down the rule that prayer is to be through Christ\r\nalone, and the saints and relics are not to be worshipped. And no\r\nprayer-book or liturgy in any branch of the Reformed Church contains\r\nprayers addressed to any of the saints or to the Blessed Virgin.\r\n\r\n2. The Reformers insist on the necessity of Christ and of Christ alone for\r\nall believers. Their Confessions abound in expressions which are meant to\r\nmagnify the Person and Work of Christ, and to show that He fills the whole\r\nfield of believing thought and worship. The brief Netherlands Confession\r\nof 1566 has no less than three separate sections on _Christ the only\r\nMediator and Reconciler_, on _Christ the only Teacher,_ and on _Christ the\r\nonly High Priest and Sacrifice_.(433) The _Heidelberg_ or _Palatine\r\nCatechism_ calls Christ _my faithful Saviour_, and says that we can call\r\nourselves Christians “because by faith we are members of Jesus Christ and\r\npartakers of His anointing, so that we both confess His Holy Name and\r\npresent ourselves unto Him a lively offering of thanksgiving, and in this\r\nlife may with free conscience fight against sin and Satan, and afterwards\r\npossess with Christ an everlasting kingdom over all creatures.” The Scots\r\nConfession abounds in phrases intended to honour our Lord Jesus Christ. It\r\ncalls Him _Messiah_, _Eternal Wisdom_, _Emmanuel_, _our Head_, _Our\r\nBrother_, _our Pastor and great Bishop of our souls_, the _Author of\r\nLife_, the _Lamb of God_, the _Advocate and Mediator_, and the _Only High\r\nPriest_. All the Confessions of the Churches of the Reformation contain\r\nthe same or similar expressions. The liturgies of the Churches also abound\r\nin similar terms of adoration.\r\n\r\n3. The Reformers declare that Christ is the _only_ Revealer of God. “We\r\nwould never recognise the Father’s grace and mercy,” says Luther in his\r\nLarge Catechism, “were it not for our Lord Jesus Christ, Who is the mirror\r\nof the Father’s heart.” “We are not affrayed to cal God our Father,” says\r\nthe Scots Confession, “not sa meikle because He has created us, quhilk we\r\nhave in common with the reprobate, as for that He has given us His onely\r\nSon.” The instructions issued by the Synod which met at Bern in 1532 are\r\nvery emphatic upon this thought, as may be seen from the headings of the\r\nvarious articles: (Art. 2) That the whole doctrine is the unique Christ\r\n(_Das die gantze leer der eynig Christus sye_); (Art. 3) That God is\r\nrevealed to the people in Christ alone; (Art. 5) That the gracious God is\r\nperceived through Christ alone without any mediation; (Art. 6) A Christian\r\nsermon is entirely about and from Christ. It is said under the third\r\narticle: “His Son in Whom we see the work of God and His Fatherly heart\r\ntoward us ... which is not the case where the preacher talks much about\r\nGod in the heathen manner, and does not exhibit the same God in the face\r\nof Christ.”(434) The Confessions also unite in declaring that the gift of\r\nthe Holy Spirit comes from Christ.\r\n\r\n4. The conception that Christ filled the whole sphere of God, which was\r\nfor the Reformers a fundamental and experimental fact, enabled them to\r\nconstruct a spiritual doctrine of the sacraments which they opposed to\r\nthat held in the mediæval Church. Of course, it was various theories about\r\nthe sacraments which caused the chief differences among the Reformers\r\nthemselves; but apart from all varying ideas—consubstantiation, ubiquity,\r\nsigns exhibiting and signs representing—the Reformers united on the\r\nthoughts that the efficacy in the sacraments depended entirely on the\r\npromises of Christ contained in His word, and that the virtue in the\r\nsacraments consisted in the presence of Christ to the believing\r\ncommunicant. What was received in the sacraments was not a vague,\r\nmysterious, not to say magical, grace, but Christ Jesus Himself. He gave\r\nHimself in the sacraments in whatever way His presence might be explained.\r\n\r\nThey all taught that the efficacy of the sacraments depends upon the\r\npromise of Christ contained in their institution, and they insisted that\r\nword and sacrament must always be taken together. Thus Luther points out\r\nin the _Babylonish Captivity of the Church_ that one objection to the\r\nRoman practice is that the recipients “never hear the words of the promise\r\nwhich are secretly mumbled by the priest,” and exhorts his readers never\r\nto lose sight of the all-important connection between the word of promise\r\nand the sacraments; and in his Large Catechism he declares that the\r\nsacraments include the Word. “I exhort you,” he says, “never to sunder the\r\nWord and the water, or to separate them. For where the Word is withheld we\r\nhave only such water as the maid uses to cook with.” Non-Lutheran\r\nConfessions are equally decided on the necessity of connecting the promise\r\nand the words of Christ with the sacraments. The Thirty-nine Articles\r\ndeclare that the sacraments are effectual because of “Christ’s institution\r\nand promise.” The Heidelberg or Palatine Catechism (1563) says that the\r\nsacraments “are holy and visible signs ordained of God, to the end that He\r\nmight thereby the more fully declare and seal unto us the _promise_ of the\r\nHoly Gospel.”\r\n\r\nSimilarly the Reformers unanimously declared that the virtue in the\r\nsacraments consisted in no mysterious grace, but in the fact that in them\r\nbelieving partakers met and received Christ Himself. In the articles of\r\nthe Bern Synod (1532) we are told that the sacraments are mysteries of\r\nGod, “through which from without Christ is proffered to believers.” The\r\nFirst Helvetic Confession (1536) says, concerning the Holy Supper, “we\r\nhold that in the same the Lord truly offers His Body and His Blood, that\r\nis, Himself, to His own.” The Second Helvetic Confession (1562) declares\r\nthat “the Body of Christ is in heaven at the right hand of the Father,”\r\nand enjoins communicants “to lift up their hearts and not to direct them\r\ndownwards to the bread. For as the sun, though absent from us in the\r\nheaven, is none the less efficaciously present ... so much more the Sun of\r\nrighteousness absent from us in the heavens in His Body, is present to us\r\nnot indeed corporeally, but spiritually by a life-giving activity.” The\r\nFrench Confession of 1557 says that the sacraments are pledges and seals,\r\nand adds, “Yet we hold that their substance and truth is in Jesus Christ.”\r\nSo the Scots Confession of 1560 declares that “we assuredlie beleeve that\r\nbe Baptisme we ar ingrafted in Christ Jesus to be made partakers of His\r\njustice, be quhilk our sinnes ar covered and remitted. And alswa, that in\r\nthe Supper richtlie used, Christ Jesus is so joined with us, that Hee\r\nbecummis very nurishment and fude of our saules.” In the _Manner of the\r\nAdministration of the Lord’s Supper_ the Scottish Reformation Church\r\ndirected the minister in his exhortation to say to the people: “The end of\r\nour coming to the Lord’s Table ... is to seek our life and perfection in\r\nJesus Christ, acknowledging ourselves at the same time to be children of\r\nwrath and condemnation. Let us consider then that this sacrament is a\r\nsingular medicine for all poor sick creatures, a comfortable help to weak\r\nsouls, and that our Lord requireth no other worthiness on our part, but\r\nthat we unfeignedly acknowledge our naughtiness and imperfection.”\r\n\r\nEverywhere in prayer, worship, and teaching the Reformers see Christ\r\nfilling the whole sphere of God. Jesus was God appearing in history and\r\naddressing man.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 6. The Church.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the Epistles of St. Paul, the Church of Christ stands forth as a\r\n_fellowship_ which is both divine and human. On the side of the divine it\r\nis a fellowship with Jesus, its crucified, risen, and ascended Lord; on\r\nthe human, it is a fellowship among men who stand in the same relation to\r\nJesus. This fellowship with Jesus and with the brethren is the secret of\r\nthe Church—what expresses it, what makes it different from all other\r\nfellowships. Every other characteristic which belongs to it must be\r\ncoloured by this thought of a double fellowship. It is the double relation\r\nwhich makes it difficult to construct a conception of the Church. It is\r\neasy to feel it as an experience, but it has always been found hard to\r\nexpress it in propositions.\r\n\r\nIt does not require much elaborate thinking to construct a theory of the\r\nChurch which will be true to all that is said about the fellowship on its\r\ndivine side; nor is it very difficult to think of a great visible and\r\nhistorical organisation which in some external aspects represents the\r\nChristian fellowship, provided the hidden union with Christ, so prominent\r\nin St. Paul’s descriptions, be either entirely neglected or explained in\r\nexternal and material ways. The difficulty arises when both the divine and\r\nthe human sides of the fellowship are persistently and earnestly kept in\r\nview.\r\n\r\nIt is always hard to explain the unseen by the seen, the eternal by the\r\ntemporal, and the divine by the human; and the task is almost greater than\r\nusual when the union of these two elements in the Church of Christ is the\r\ntheme of discussion. It need not surprise us, therefore, that all down\r\nthrough the Middle Ages there appear, not one, but two conceptions of the\r\nChristian Church which never harmonised. On the one side, the Church was\r\nthought of as a fellowship of God with man, depending on the inscrutable\r\npurpose of God, and independent of all visible outward organisation; on\r\nthe other, it was a great society which existed in the world of history,\r\nand was held together by visible political ties like other societies.\r\nAugustine had both conceptions, and the dialectical skill of the great\r\ntheologian of the West was unable to fuse them into one harmonious whole.\r\n\r\nThese two separate, almost mutually exclusive, ideas of what the Church of\r\nChrist was, lived side by side during the Middle Ages in the same\r\nunconnected fashion. The former, the spiritual Church with its real but\r\nunseen fellowship with Christ, was the pre-eminently religious thought. It\r\nwas the ground on which the most conspicuous mediæval piety rested. It was\r\nthe garden in which bloomed the flowers of mediæval mystical devotion. The\r\nlatter was built up by the juristic dialectic of Roman canonists into the\r\nconception that the Church was a visible hierarchical State having a\r\nstrictly monarchical constitution—its king being the Bishop of Rome, who\r\nwas the visible representative of Christ. This conception became almost\r\npurely political. It was the active force in all ecclesiastical struggles\r\nwith princes and peoples, with Reformers, and with so-called heretics and\r\nschismatics. It reduced the Church to the level of the State, and\r\ncontained little to stimulate to piety or to holy living.\r\n\r\nThe labours of the great Schoolmen of the thirteenth century did try to\r\ntransform this political Church into what might represent the double\r\nfellowship with Christ and with fellow-believers which is so prominent a\r\nthought in the New Testament. They did so by attempting to show that the\r\ngreat political Church was an enclosure containing certain indefinite\r\nmysterious powers of redemption which saved men who willingly placed\r\nthemselves within the sphere of their operation. They maintained that the\r\ncore of the hierarchical constitution of the Church was the priesthood,\r\nand that this priesthood was a species of plastic medium through which,\r\nand through which alone, God worked in dispensing, by means of the\r\nsacraments entrusted to the priesthood, His saving grace. It may be\r\nquestioned whether the thought of the Church as an institution, possessing\r\nwithin itself certain mysterious redemptive powers which are to be found\r\nnowhere else, was ever thoroughly harmonised with that which regarded it\r\nas a mass of legal statutes embodied in canon law and dominated by papal\r\nabsolutism. The two conceptions remained distinct, mutually aiding each\r\nother, but never exactly coalescing. Thus in the sixteenth century no less\r\nthan three separate ideas of the Church of Christ were present to fill the\r\nminds and imaginations of men; but the dominant idea for the practical\r\nreligious life was certainly that which represented the Church as an\r\ninstitution which, because it possessed the priesthood, was the society\r\nwithin which salvation was to be found.\r\n\r\nLuther had enjoyed to the full the benefits of this society, and had with\r\nardour and earnestness sought to make use of all its redemptive powers. He\r\nhad felt, simply because he was so honest with himself, that it had not\r\nmade him a real Christian, and that its mysterious powers had worked on\r\nhim in vain. His living Christian experience made him know and feel that\r\nwhatever the Church of Christ was, it was not a society within which\r\npriests exercised their secret science of redemption. It was and must be a\r\nfellowship of holy and Christlike people; but he felt it very difficult to\r\nexpress his experience in phrases that could satisfy him. It was hard to\r\nget rid of thoughts which he had cherished from childhood, and none of\r\nthese inherited beliefs had more power over him than the idea that the\r\nChurch, however described, was the Pope’s House in which the Bishop of\r\nRome ruled, and ought to rule, as house-father. It is interesting to study\r\nby what devious paths he arrived at a clear view of what the Church of\r\nChrist really is;(435) to notice how shreds of the old opinions which had\r\nlain dormant in his mind every now and then start afresh into life; and\r\nhow, while he had learnt to know the uselessness of many institutions of\r\nthe mediæval Church, he could not easily divest his mind of the thought\r\nthat they naturally belonged to a Church Visible. Monastic vows, the\r\ncelibacy of the clergy, fasting, the hierarchy, the supremacy of the Pope,\r\nthe power of excommunication with all its dreaded consequences, were all\r\nthe natural accompaniments of a Visible Church according to mediæval\r\nideas, and Luther relinquished them with difficulty. From the first,\r\nAugustine’s thought of the Church, which consists of the elect, helped\r\nhim; he found that Huss held the same idea, and he wrote to a friend that\r\n“we have been all Hussites without knowing it.”(436) But while Luther and\r\nall the Reformers held strongly by this conception of Augustine, it was\r\nnot of very much service in determining the conception of the Visible\r\nChurch which was the more important practically; and although the\r\ndefinition of the Catholic Church Invisible has found its way into most\r\nProtestant Confessions, and has been used by Protestants polemically, it\r\nhas always remained something of a background, making clearer the\r\nconception of the Church in general, but has been of little service in\r\ngiving clear views of what the Church Visible is. From the very first,\r\nhowever, Luther saw in a certain indefinite way that there was a real\r\nconnection between the conception of the Visible Church and the\r\nproclamation of the Word of God—a thought which was destined to grow more\r\nand more definite till it completely possessed him. As early as October\r\n1518, he could inform Cajetan that the Pope must be under the rule of the\r\nWord of God and not superior to it.(437) His discovery that the communion\r\nof the saints (_communio sanctorum_) was not necessarily a hierarchy\r\n(_ecclesia prælatorum_),(438) was made soon afterwards. After the Leipzig\r\nDisputation his views became clearer, and by 1520 they stood revealed in\r\nthe three great Reformation treatises.\r\n\r\nLuther’s doctrine of the Church is extremely simple. The Church is, as the\r\nCreed defines it to be, the _Communion of the Saints_, which has come into\r\nexistence through the proclamation of the Word of God heard and received\r\nby faith. He simplified this fundamental Christian conception in a\r\nwonderful way. The Church rests on the sure and stable foundation of the\r\nWord of God; and this Word of God is not a weary round of statutes issued\r\nblasphemously by the Bishops of Rome in God’s name. It is not the\r\ninvitations of a priesthood to come and share mysterious and indefinite\r\npowers of salvation given to them in their command over the sacraments. It\r\nis not a lengthy doctrinal system constructed out of detached texts of\r\nHoly Scripture by the application of a fourfold sense used under the\r\nguidance of a dogmatic tradition or a rule of faith. It is the substance\r\nof the Scriptures. It is the “gospel according to a pure understanding.”\r\nIt is the “promises of God”; “the testimony of Jesus, Who is the Saviour\r\nof souls”; it is the “consolations offered in Christ.” It is, as Calvin\r\nsaid, “the spiritual gate whereby we enter into God’s heavenly kingdom”;\r\nthe “mirror in which faith beholds God.” It is, according to the\r\nWestminster Confession, the sum of God’s commands, threatenings, promises,\r\nand, above all, the offer of Christ Jesus. All these things are\r\napprehended by faith. The Church comes into existence by faith responding\r\nto the proclamation of the Word of God. This is the sure and stable thing\r\nupon which the Church of Christ is founded.\r\n\r\nThe Church of Christ, therefore, is a body of which the Spirit of Jesus is\r\nthe soul. It is a company of Christlike men and women, whom the Holy\r\nSpirit has called, enlightened, and sanctified through the preaching of\r\nthe word; who are encouraged to look forward to a glorious future prepared\r\nfor the people of God; and who, meanwhile, manifest their faith in all\r\nmanner of loving services done to their fellow-believers.\r\n\r\nThe Church is therefore in some sense invisible. Its secret is its hidden\r\nfellowship with Jesus. Its roots penetrate the unseen, and draw from\r\nthence the nourishment needed to sustain its life. But it is a visible\r\nsociety, and can be seen wherever the Word of God is faithfully\r\nproclaimed, and wherever faith is manifested in testimony and in bringing\r\nforth the fruits of the Spirit.\r\n\r\nThis is the essential mode of describing the Church which has found place\r\nin the Reformation creeds. Some vary in the ways in which they express the\r\nthought; some do not sufficiently distinguish, in words at least, between\r\nwhat the Church is and what it has, between what makes its being and what\r\nis included in its well-being. But in all there are the two thoughts that\r\nthe Church is made visible by the two fundamental things—the proclamation\r\nof the word and the manifestation of faith.\r\n\r\nThis mode of describing the Church of Christ defines it by that element\r\nwhich separates it from all other forms of human association—its special\r\nrelation to the divine; and it is shown to be visible at the place where\r\nthat divine element can and does manifest itself. It defines the Church by\r\nits most essential element, and sets aside all that is accidental. It\r\nconcerns itself with what the Church is, and does not include what the\r\nChurch has. It therefore provides room for all things which belong to the\r\nwell-being of the Church—only it relegates them to their proper\r\nplace.(439)\r\n\r\nIf the proclamation of the Word of God, and the manifestation of the faith\r\nwhich answers, be the essence of the Church, all that tends to aid both is\r\nto be included in the thought. There must be a ministry of some sort in\r\nword and sacrament instituted within the Church of Christ in order to lead\r\nthe individual to faith. God has created this ministry, and all the\r\nReformed Churches were careful to declare that no one should seek entrance\r\ninto office unless he was assured that he had been called of God thereto;\r\nand as his function is to be a minister of the Church and a servant of the\r\nfaithful, no one “should publicly teach or administer the sacraments\r\nunless he be duly called (_nisi rite vocatus_).” Such a ministry has its\r\nfield simply in ministering the means of grace. “The Church of Christ,”\r\nsays Luther, “requires an honest ministry diligently and loyally\r\ninstructed in the holy Word of God after a pure Christian understanding,\r\nand without the addition of any false traditions. In and through such a\r\nministry it will be made plain what are Christ and His Evangel, how to\r\nattain to the forgiveness of sins, and the properties and power of the\r\n_keys_ in the Church.”\r\n\r\nAll this is matter of administration. Some societies of believers may have\r\ndifferent ideas about the precise form that this ministry ought to take;\r\nbut such differences, while they may lead to separate administrations, do\r\nnot imply any separation from the one Catholic Church of Christ to which\r\nthey all belong. However outwardly they differ, all retain the essential\r\nthings—the preaching and teaching of the Word of God and the due\r\nadministration of the sacraments. Some may prefer to set forth a creed of\r\none kind and others may prefer another. The French, the Scottish, and the\r\nDutch Churches had all their own creeds, and all believed each other to be\r\nparts of the same One Catholic Church of Christ.\r\n\r\n\r\n    “When we affirm,” says Calvin, “the pure ministry of the Word, and\r\n    our order in the celebration of the Sacraments, to be a sufficient\r\n    pledge and earnest that we may safely embrace the society in which\r\n    both these are found as a true Church, we carry the observation to\r\n    this point, that such a society should never be rejected as long\r\n    as it continues in these things, although it may be chargeable in\r\n    other respects with many errors.”(440)\r\n\r\n\r\nWithin this Christian fellowship, which is the Church of Christ, the sense\r\nby which we see God is awakened and our faith is nourished and quickened.\r\nThe Word of God speaks to us not merely in the public worship of the\r\nfaithful, but in and through the lives of the brethren; their deeds act on\r\nus as the simple stories of experience and providence which the Scriptures\r\ncontain. God’s Word speaks to us in a thousand ways in the lives and\r\nsympathies of the brethren. The Christian “receives the revelation of God\r\nin the living relationships of the Christian brotherhood, and its\r\nessential contents are that personal life of Jesus which is visible in the\r\ngospel and which is expounded by the lives of the redeemed.”(441)\r\n\r\n\r\n    “The Christian Church,” says Luther, “keeps all words of God in\r\n    its heart, and turns them round and round, and keeps their\r\n    connection with one another and with Scripture! Therefore, anyone\r\n    who is to find Christ must first find the Church. How could anyone\r\n    know where Christ is and faith in Him is, unless he knew where His\r\n    believers are? Whoever wishes to know something about Christ must\r\n    not trust to himself, nor by the help of his own reason build a\r\n    bridge of his own to heaven, but must go to the Church, must visit\r\n    it and make inquiry. Now the Church is not wood and stone, but the\r\n    company of people who believe in Christ.

It is perhaps worth\r\n      remarking that, according to the almost universal custom in mediæval\r\n      Germany, and in spite of ecclesiastical commands and threats, the\r\n      actual marriage ceremony consisted in the father of the bride\r\n      demanding from the young people whether they took each other for man\r\n      and wife, and in their promising themselves to each other before\r\n      witnesses. It was not until the morning after the marriage had been\r\n      consummated that the wedded pair went to church to get the priest’s\r\n      blessing on a marriage that had taken place.\r\n\r\n   56 Barack, _Zeitschrift für deutsche Culturgeschichte_, iv.

It reflects the\r\n      opinions of the time almost as faithfully as the folk-songs do, and\r\n      contains the above quoted saying of Charles; cf. pp. 61 ff.\r\n\r\n   60 The best account of this movement is to be found in an article\r\n      contributed to the _Archiv des historischen Vereins von Unterfranken\r\n      und Aschaffenburg,_ XIV. iii. 1, where Hans Böhm’s sayings have been\r\n      carefully collected.

The English word, suggesting as it does cavalry\r\n      armed with lances, is very misleading. The victories of the Swiss\r\n      peasants, and their reputation as soldiers, suggested to the Emperor\r\n      Frederick, and especially to his son, the Emperor Maximilian, the\r\n      formation of troops of infantry recruited from the peasantry and\r\n      from the lower classes of townsmen. Troops of cavalry of a like\r\n      origin were also formed, and they were called _reiters_ or\r\n      _reisiger_. These mercenaries frequently gained much money both from\r\n      pay and from plunder, and were regarded as heroes by the members of\r\n      the classes from whom they had sprung. Liliencron’s _Die\r\n      historischen Volkslieder vom 13ten bis zum 16ten Jahrhundert_\r\n      contains many folk-songs celebrating their prowess.

Mr. Seebohm seems to think that the Reformers clung to the\r\n      mediæval conception of the inspiration of Scripture. Calvin held the\r\n      same ideas as Colet, and expressed them in the same way. Cf. his\r\n      comments on Matt. xxvii. 9: “Quomodo Hieremiæ nomen obrepserit, me\r\n      nescire fateor, _nec anxie laboro_: certe Hieremiæ nomen _errore_\r\n      positum esse pro Zacharia, res ipsa ostendit”; and his comment on\r\n      Acts vii. 16: “quare his locus corrigendus est.”\r\n\r\n  118 Colet’s abstracts of the _Celestial_ and of the _Terrestrial\r\n      Hierarchies_ have been published by the Rev. J. H. Lupton (London,\r\n      1869), from the MS. at St. Paul’s School. Mr. Lupton has also\r\n      published Colet’s treatise _On the Sacraments of the Church_\r\n      (London, 1867). The best edition of the works of the\r\n      pseudo-Dionysius is that of Balthasar Corderius, S.J., published at\r\n      Venice in 1755. The actual writings of the pseudo-Dionysius are not\r\n      extensive; the editor has added translations, notes, scholia,\r\n      commentaries, etc., and his folio edition contains more than one\r\n      thousand pages.\r\n\r\n  119 “The radical conception is most often due to Dionysius; the passages\r\n      represent the effervescence produced by the Dionysian conceptions in\r\n      Colet’s mind.... The fire was indeed very much Colet’s. I find\r\n      passages which burn in Colet’s abstract, freeze in the\r\n      original.”—Seebohm, _The Oxford Reformers_, p. 76 (2nd ed., London,\r\n      1869). My knowledge of Colet’s sermons comes from the extracts in\r\n      Mr. Seebohm’s work.\r\n\r\n  120 Cf. Mr. Lupton’s translation of the _Ecclesiastical Hierarchies_, c.\r\n      ii. If it be permissible to adduce evidence from the _Utopia_ of Sir\r\n      Thomas More, the anti-sacerdotal views of the Oxford Reformers went\r\n      much further. In _Utopia_ confession was made to the head of the\r\n      family and not to the priests; women could be priests; divorce from\r\n      bed and board was permitted. Cf. the Temple Classics edition, p. 116\r\n      (divorce), p. 148 (women-priests), p. 152 (confession).\r\n\r\n  121 Seebohm, _The Oxford Reformers_, p. 221 (2nd ed. 1869).\r\n\r\n  122 Erasmus, _Opera Omnia_ (Leyden, 1703-1706), v. 140.\r\n\r\n  123 Erasmus, _Opera Omnia_ (Leyden, 1703-1706), v. 26.

Oergel has shown, from minute\r\n      researches in the university archives, that a special friend of\r\n      Luther’s, Hieronymus Pontz of Windsheim, who was working along with\r\n      him for his Magister’s degree, died suddenly of pleurisy before the\r\n      end of the examination; that a few weeks after Luther had taken his\r\n      degree, another promising student whom he knew died of the plague;\r\n      that the plague broke out again in Erfurt three months afterwards;\r\n      and that Luther entered the convent a few days after this second\r\n      appearance of the plague.—Cf. Georg Oergel, _Vom jungen Luther_\r\n      (Erfurt, 1899), pp. 35-41.\r\n\r\n  134 Cf. above, pp. 127 ff.\r\n\r\n  135 In my chapter on Luther in the _Cambridge Modern History_, ii. p.\r\n      114, where notes were not permitted, I have said with too much\r\n      abruptness that John of Paltz was “the teacher of Luther himself.”\r\n      Luther was certainly taught the theology of John of Paltz, and the\r\n      latter was residing in the monastery during two years of Luther’s\r\n      stay there; but it is more probable that Luther’s actual instructor\r\n      was Nathin.\r\n\r\n  136 In the _Tischreden_ (Preger, Leipzig, 1888), i. 27, the saying is\r\n      attributed to Bartholomæus Usingen, who is erroneously called\r\n      Luther’s teacher in the Erfurt convent. Usingen did not enter the\r\n      convent before 1512. He was a professor in the University of Erfurt,\r\n      not in the convent.\r\n\r\n  137 N. Selneccer, _Historia . . . D. M. Lutheri_: “Jussus est omissis\r\n      Sacris Bibliis ex obedientia legere scholastica et sophistica\r\n      scripta.”\r\n\r\n  138 Modern Romanists describe all this as the self-torturing of an\r\n      hysterical youth. They are surely oblivious to the fact that the\r\n      only great German mediæval Mystic who has been canonised by the\r\n      Romish Church, Henry Suso, went through a similar experience; and\r\n      that these very experiences were in both cases looked on by\r\n      contemporaries as the fruits of a more than ordinary piety.\r\n\r\n_  139 Resolutiones_, Preface.\r\n\r\n  140 Acts viii. 4.\r\n\r\n  141 Rom. xiii. 14.\r\n\r\n  142 Matt. x. 9.\r\n\r\n  143 Prov. ii. 1.\r\n\r\n  144 “If we review all the men and women of the West since Augustine’s\r\n      time, whom, for the disposition which possessed them, history has\r\n      designated as eminent Christians, we have always the same type; we\r\n      find marked conviction of sin, complete renunciation of their own\r\n      strength, and trust in grace, in the personal God who is apprehended\r\n      as the _Merciful One_ in the humility of Christ. The variations of\r\n      this frame of mind are innumerable—but the fundamental type is the\r\n      same. This frame of mind is taught in sermons and in instruction by\r\n      truly pious Romanists and by Evangelicals; in it youthful Christians\r\n      are trained, and dogmatics are constructed in harmony with it. It\r\n      has always produced so powerful an effect, even where it is only\r\n      preached as the experience of others, that he who has come in\r\n      contact with it can never forget it; it accompanies him as a pillar\r\n      of cloud by day and of fire by night; he who imagines that he has\r\n      long shaken it off, sees it rising up suddenly before him\r\n      again.”—Harnack’s _History of Dogma_, v. 74 (Eng. trans., London,\r\n      1898).\r\n\r\n  145 The Wolfenbüttel Library contains the Psalter (Vulgate) used by\r\n      Luther in lecturing on the Psalms. The book was printed at\r\n      Wittenberg in 1513 by John Gronenberg, and contains Luther’s notes\r\n      written on the margin and between the printed lines.\r\n\r\n  146 Luther’s indebtedness to Gerson (Jean Charlier, born in 1363 at\r\n      Gerson, a hamlet near Rethel in the Ardennes, believed by some to be\r\n      the author of the _De Imitatione Christi_) has not been sufficiently\r\n      noticed. It may be partially estimated by Luther’s own statement\r\n      that most experimental divines, including Augustine, when dealing\r\n      with the struggle of the awakened soul, lay most stress on that part\r\n      of the conflict which comes from temptations of the flesh; Gerson\r\n      confines himself to those which are purely spiritual. Luther, during\r\n      his soul-anguish in the convent, was a young monk who had lived a\r\n      humanly stainless life, _sans peur et sans reproche_; Augustine, a\r\n      middle-aged professor of rhetoric, had been living for years in a\r\n      state of sinful concubinage.\r\n\r\n  147 It is commonly said that Luther made use of the _mystical_ passages\r\n      found in these and other authors; but _mystical_ is a very ambiguous\r\n      word. It is continually used to express personal or individual piety\r\n      in general; or this personal religion as opposed to that religious\r\n      life which is consciously lived within the fellowship of men called\r\n      the Church, provided with the external means of grace. These are,\r\n      however, very loose uses of the word. The fundamental problem, even\r\n      in Christian Mysticism, appears to me to be how to bridge the gulf\r\n      between the creature and the Creator, while the problem in\r\n      Reformation theology is how to span the chasm between the sinful man\r\n      and the righteous God. Hence in mysticism the _tendency_ is always\r\n      to regard sin as imperfection, while in the Reformation theology sin\r\n      is always the power of evil and invariably includes the thought of\r\n      guilt. Luther was no mystic in the sense of desiring to be lost _in_\r\n      God: he wished to be saved _through_ Christ.\r\n\r\n  148 Of course, Luther’s intense individuality appeared in his language\r\n      from the first. Take as an example a note on Ps. lxxxiv. 4: “As the\r\n      meadow is to the cow, the house to the man, the nest to the bird,\r\n      the rock to the chamois, and the stream to the fish, so is the Holy\r\n      Scripture to the believing soul.”\r\n\r\n  149 The expression is interesting, because it shows that Luther’s\r\n      influence had made at least two of his colleagues change their\r\n      views. Nicholas Amsdorf and Andrew Bodenstein of Carlstadt had come\r\n      to Wittenberg to teach Scholastic Theology, and Amsdorf had made a\r\n      great name for himself as an exponent of the older type of that\r\n      theology.\r\n\r\n  150 An illustrated catalogue of Frederick’s collection of relics was\r\n      prepared by Lucas Cranach, and published under the title,\r\n      _Wittenberger Heiligthumsbuch vom Jahre 1509_.

It is found as early as the time of Tertullian\r\n      and Cyprian.\r\n\r\n  154 Tertullian was no believer in any indulgence shown to penitent\r\n      sinners, and his account of the way in which penitents appeared\r\n      before the congregation to ask for a remission or mitigation of the\r\n      ecclesiastical sentence pronounced against them is doubtless a\r\n      caricature, but it may be taken as a not unfair description of what\r\n      must have frequently taken place: “You introduce into the Church the\r\n      penitent adulterer for the purpose of melting the brotherhood by his\r\n      supplications. You lead him into the midst, clad in sackcloth,\r\n      covered with ashes, a compound of disgrace and horror. He prostrates\r\n      himself before the widows, before the elders, suing for the tears of\r\n      all; he seizes the edges of their garments, he clasps their knees,\r\n      he kisses the prints of their feet.

This called forth, towards the end of the year, _The Answer\r\n      of an Unlearned Canon_, which was generally ascribed to Bernard\r\n      Adelmann, a canon of Augsburg, but which was really written by\r\n      Oecolampadius.

But we have\r\n      another glimpse in the conversation with his sister Maria, in which\r\n      he confesses that he had come to think better of the Lutherans, for\r\n      he had learned to know that they taught nothing outside the\r\n      Apostles’ Creed.

(Berlin, 1890).\r\n\r\n  186 Armstrong, _The Emperor Charles __V._, p. 73 (London, 1902).\r\n\r\n  187 Charles V. had for his confessor Jean Glapion, who figured largely\r\n      in the preliminary scenes before Luther arrived at Worms. He had a\r\n      remarkable conversation with Dr. Brück, the Elector of Saxony’s\r\n      Chancellor, in which he professed to speak for the Emperor as well\r\n      as for himself. Luther’s earlier writings had given him great\r\n      pleasure; he believed him to be a “plant of renown,” able to produce\r\n      splendid fruit for the Church. But the book on the _Babylonian\r\n      Captivity_ had shocked him; he did not believe it to be Luther’s; it\r\n      was not in his usual style; if Luther had written it, it must have\r\n      been because he was momentarily indignant at the papal Bull, and as\r\n      it was anonymous, it could easily be repudiated; or if not\r\n      repudiated, it might be explained, and its sentences shown to be\r\n      capable of a Catholic interpretation. If this were done, and if\r\n      Luther withdrew his violent writings against the Pope, there was no\r\n      reason why an amicable arrangement should not be come to. The Papal\r\n      Bull could easily be got over, it could be withdrawn on the ground\r\n      that Luther had never had a fair trial. It was a mistake to suppose\r\n      that the Emperor was not keenly alive to the need for a reformation\r\n      of the Church; there were limits to his devotion to the Pope; the\r\n      Emperor believed that he would deserve the wrath of God if he did\r\n      not try to amend the deplorable condition of the Church of Christ.\r\n      Such was Glapion’s statement. It is a question how far he was\r\n      sincere, and how far he could speak for the Emperor. He was a friend\r\n      and admirer of Erasmus; but the Dutchman had said that no man could\r\n      conceal his own views so skilfully. The Elector heard that after\r\n      this conversation Glapion had got from Aleander 400 copies of the\r\n      Bull against Luther, and had distributed them among Franciscan\r\n      monks. This made him doubt his sincerity, and he refused to grant\r\n      him an audience. Cf. _Reichstagsakten_, ii. 477 ff.\r\n\r\n  188 A study of dates throws light on these bargainings. In Oct. 1520,\r\n      Charles issued an edict ordering the burning of Luther’s books\r\n      within his hereditary dominions. In the following weeks Aleander was\r\n      pressing Charles to make the edict universal; this was declared to\r\n      be impossible, but (Nov. 28th) Charles wrote to the Elector of\r\n      Saxony ordering him to produce Luther at Worms, and to hinder him\r\n      from writing anything more against the Pope; as it were in answer\r\n      (Dec. 12th), the Pope intimated to Charles that he had withdrawn his\r\n      briefs about the Inquisition in Spain. The Emperor reached Worms\r\n      about the middle of December. On Jan. 3rd (1521) the Pope simplified\r\n      matters for the Emperor by issuing a new Bull, _Decet Romanum_,\r\n      containing the names of Luther and Hutten; the Diet opened Jan.\r\n      28th; Aleander made his three hours’ speech against Luther on Feb.\r\n      13; Feb. 19th, the Estates resolved that Luther should appear before\r\n      them, and not for the simple purpose of recantation—he was to be\r\n      heard, and to receive a safe conduct; March 6th, the imperial\r\n      invitation and safe conduct, beginning with the words, _nobilis,\r\n      derote, nobis dilecte_; Aleander protested vehemently against this\r\n      address; the Emperor drafted a universal mandate ordering the\r\n      burning of Luther’s books; this probably was not published; it was\r\n      withdrawn in favour of a mandate ordering all Luther’s books to be\r\n      delivered up to the magistrates; this was published in Worms on\r\n      March 27th, and caused rioting; April 17th and 18th, Luther appeared\r\n      before the Diet; May 8th, Charles received the Pope’s pledge to take\r\n      his side against Francis; Diet agreed to the ban against Luther on\r\n      May 25th; Charles dated the ban May 8th.\r\n\r\n_  189 Calendar of State Papers, Henry __VIII.__ Letters and Papers,\r\n      Foreign and Domestic_ (London, 1867), III. i. p. 445.\r\n\r\n  190 Kalkoff, _Die Depeschen_, etc. p. 106.\r\n\r\n  191 This was probably the frontispiece of a small book containing four\r\n      of Hutten’s tracts, and entitled _Gespräch Büchlin: Herr Ulrichs von\r\n      Hutten.

It may be sufficient\r\n      to say that among them (twenty-five or so) were the appeal _To the\r\n      Christian Nobility of the German Nation_, the tract _On the Liberty\r\n      of a Christian Man_, _The Babylonian Captivity of the Church of\r\n      Christ_, _Against the Execrable Bull of Antichrist_, some\r\n      commentaries, and some tracts on religious subjects “not\r\n      contentious,” says the official record.\r\n\r\n  238 This was probably an answer to the suggestion made by Glapion to\r\n      Chancellor Brück, that if Luther would only deny the authorship of\r\n      the _Babylonian Captivity of the Church of Christ_, which had been\r\n      published anonymously, matters might be arranged.\r\n\r\n  239 The sentence, “And I have written some others which have not been\r\n      named,” was an aside spoken in a lower tone, but distinctly\r\n      (_Reichstagsakten_, ii. 589, 860).\r\n\r\n_  240 Reichstagsakten_, ii. 548. In Eck’s official report Luther’s answer\r\n      is given very briefly; instead of Luther’s words the Official says:\r\n      “As to the other part of the question, whether he wished to retract\r\n      their contents and to sing another tune (_palinodiam canere_), he\r\n      began to invent a chain of idle reasons (_causas nectere_) and to\r\n      seek means of escape (_diffugias quærere_)” (_Reichstagsakten_, ii.\r\n      589).\r\n\r\n_  241 Reichstagsakten_, ii. 851, 863: “Wir habent den Luther nit wol\r\n      horen reden, dann er mit niederer stim geredet” (Kolde, _Analecta_,\r\n      p. 30 n.).\r\n\r\n  242 Brieger, _Aleander_, etc. p. 146.\r\n\r\n_  243 Reichstagsakten_, ii. 549. Aleander, writing to Rome, says that the\r\n      Official went on to say in the name of the Emperor that Luther ought\r\n      to bear it in mind that he had written many things against the Pope\r\n      and the Apostolic Chair, and had scattered recklessly many heretical\r\n      statements which had caused great scandal, and which, if not\r\n      speedily ended, would kindle such a great conflagration as neither\r\n      Luther’s recantation nor the imperial power could extinguish; and\r\n      that he exhorted Luther to be mindful of this (Brieger, _Aleander_,\r\n      p. 147). In Eck’s official report these remarks are given as the\r\n      opinions of those princes who did not wish that Luther’s request\r\n      should be granted; but they must have been included in his speech,\r\n      for Peutinger confirms the nuncio’s report (_Reichstagsakten_, ii.\r\n      589 f., 866).\r\n\r\n  244 De Wette, _Dr. Martin Luthers Briefe_, i. 587.\r\n\r\n_  245 Reichstagsakten_, ii. 862.\r\n\r\n_  246 Ibid._ p. 853.\r\n\r\n_  247 Reichstagsakten_, ii. 549 n.; _Luther’s Works_ (Erlangen edition),\r\n      lxiv. 369.\r\n\r\n  248 “I was on my way to the audience to hear (Luther’s) speech, but the\r\n      throng was so dense that I could not get through” (Sixtus Oelhafen\r\n      to Hector Pömer, _Reichstagsakten_, ii. 854).\r\n\r\n_  249 Reichstagsakten_, ii. 864.\r\n\r\n  250 Walch, xv. 2301.\r\n\r\n_  251 Ibid._ p. 2233.\r\n\r\n_  252 Reichstagsakten_, ii. 853.\r\n\r\n  253 Brieger, _Aleander_, etc. p. 172.\r\n\r\n_  254 Reichstagsakten_, ii. 549.\r\n\r\n_  255 Ibid._ p. 550.\r\n\r\n  256 Myconius, _Historia Reformationis_ (Leipzig, 1718), p. 39.\r\n\r\n_  257 Reichstagsakten_, ii. 578.\r\n\r\n_  258 Ibid._ pp. 550 ff., 557 ff., 591 ff. etc.\r\n\r\n_  259 Luther’s Works_ (Erlangen edition), lxiv. 370.\r\n\r\n  260 Brieger, _Aleander_, etc. p. 152.\r\n\r\n_  261 Reichstagsakten_, ii. 530.\r\n\r\n_  262 Desiderii Erasmi Roterodami Opera Omnia_ (Leyden, 1703), iii. 1095:\r\n      “Jam audio multis persuasum, ex meis scriptis exstitisse totam hanc\r\n      Ecclesiæ procellam: cujus verissimi rumoris præcipuus auctor fuit\r\n      Hieronymus Aleander, homo, ut nihil aliud dicam, non superstitiose\r\n      verax.”\r\n\r\n  263 Brieger, _Aleander_, etc. p. 41.\r\n\r\n_  264 Reichstagsakten_, ii. 860 n.\r\n\r\n_  265 Ibid._ p. 860.\r\n\r\n_  266 Ibid._ p. 853.\r\n\r\n_  267 Ibid._ pp. 550, 551.\r\n\r\n  268 Myconius, _Historia Reformationis_, p. 39.\r\n\r\n  269 Walch, xv. 233.\r\n\r\n_  270 Reichstagsakten_, ii. 861.\r\n\r\n_  271 Reichstagsakten,_ ii. 555.\r\n\r\n_  272 Ibid._ p. 591.\r\n\r\n_  273 Ibid._ p. 861 n.\r\n\r\n  274 Cochlæus, _Commentarius_, etc. p. 34.\r\n\r\n_  275 Reichstagsakten_, ii. 556-558, 581, 582, 591-594.\r\n\r\n  276 Aleander wrote that the Emperor said that he did not wish to hear\r\n      more: _et allora fu detto per Cesar, che bastava et che non volera\r\n      più udir, ex quo questui negava li Concilii_ (Brieger, _Aleander_,\r\n      etc. p. 153).\r\n\r\n_  277 Reichstagsakten_, ii. 862 (Dr. Peutinger to the Council of\r\n      Augsburg). The famous ending: _Hie stehe ich, ich kann nicht anders\r\n      thun, Gott helfe mir, Amen_, which gives such a dramatic finish to\r\n      the whole scene, is not to be found in the very earliest records. It\r\n      first appeared in an account published in Wittenberg without date,\r\n      but which is probably very early, and also in the 1546 edition of\r\n      _Luther’s Works_, Various versions are given of the last words\r\n      Luther uttered—_Gott helf mir, Amen_, in the _Acta Wormaciæ_\r\n      (_Reichstagsakten_, ii, 557), which are believed to have been\r\n      corrected by Luther himself; _So helf mir Gott, denn kein\r\n      widerspruch kan ich nicht thun, Amen_, is given by Spalatin in his\r\n      _Annales_ (p. 41). Every description of the scene coming from\r\n      contemporary sources shows that there was a great deal of confusion;\r\n      it is most likely that in the excitement men carried away only a\r\n      general impression and not an exact recollection of the last words\r\n      of Luther. If it were not for Dr. Peutinger’s very definite\r\n      statement written almost immediately after the event, there seems to\r\n      be no reason why the dramatic ending should not have been the real\r\n      one.\r\n\r\n_  278 Reichstagsakten_, ii. 636.\r\n\r\n_  279 Ibid._ p. 862.\r\n\r\n_  280 Ibid._ p. 558.\r\n\r\n_  281 Reichstagsakten_, ii. 636.

From Luther’s Letter to the Nürnberg Council\r\n      (Enders, v. 244), it may be inferred that the first edition of each\r\n      of his writings was usually sold out in seven or eight weeks.\r\n\r\n  299 It was Luther’s appeal to the _Christian Nobility of the German\r\n      Nation_ which taught Ulrich von Hutten the powers of the German\r\n      language; Strauss, _Ulrich von Hutten, His Life and Times_ (London,\r\n      1874), p. 241.\r\n\r\n  300 A number of the more important of these controversial writings have\r\n      been reprinted under the title _Flugschriften aus der\r\n      Reformationszeit_ in the very useful series _Neudrucke deutscher\r\n      Litteraturwerke_, in the course of publication by Niemeyer of Halle;\r\n      cf. also Kuczynski, _Thesaurus libellorum historiam Reformatorum\r\n      illustrantium_ (Leipzig, 1870); O.

Sickingen is one of the speakers; the author shows an\r\n      acquaintance with Scripture and with theology which Hutten could\r\n      scarcely command; and the idea of ecclesiastical polity sketched\r\n      seems lo be taken from Marsilius of Padua.\r\n\r\n  305 Hulsse, _Die Einführung der Reformation in der Stadt Magdeburg_\r\n      (Magdeburg, 1883), p. 46.\r\n\r\n  306 The woodcut was first used to illustrate Hans Sachs’ poem, “Der gut\r\n      Hirt und der böss Hirt, Johannis am Zehenden Capitel”; and is given\r\n      in a facsimile reproduction of several of Hans Sachs’ poems, sacred\r\n      and secular, entitled _Hans Sachs im Gewande seiner Zeit_, Gotha,\r\n      1821.

In anticipation of the Diet the Emperor had\r\n      privately asked Melanchthon to give him a statement of the _minimum_\r\n      of concessions which would content the Lutherans. Melanchthon seems\r\n      to have answered (our source of information is not very definite):\r\n      the Eucharist in both kinds; marriage of priests permitted; the\r\n      omission of the canon of the Mass; concession of the Church lands\r\n      already sequestrated; and the decision of the other matters in\r\n      dispute at a free General Council. Charles had sent the document to\r\n      Rome; it had been debated at a conclave of cardinals, who had\r\n      decided that none of the demands could be granted.\r\n\r\n  346 One document says: “Es war aber zum ersten die _confutation_ wol bey\r\n      zweihundert und achtzig bletter lang gewesen, aber die key.

We read of banquets, where Lutherans and\r\n      Romanists sat side by side; of dances that went on far into the\r\n      night; of what may be called a garden party in a “fair meadow,”\r\n      where a wooden house was built for the accommodation of the ladies;\r\n      and of tournaments. At one of them, Ferdinand, the Emperor’s\r\n      brother, was thrown and his horse rolled over him; and Melanchthon\r\n      wrote to Luther that six men had been killed at one of these “gentle\r\n      and joyous” passages of arms.\r\n\r\n  351 The Romanist majority had resolved to fight the Protestant minority,\r\n      not in the battlefield, but in the law-courts—_nicht fechten sondern\r\n      rechten_, was the phrase.\r\n\r\n  352 When the religious war did begin in 1545, Charles justified the use\r\n      of force on the grounds that the Elector of Saxony and the Landgrave\r\n      of Hesse had violated the constitution of the Empire, _had\r\n      repudiated the decisions of the Reichskammersgericht_, and had\r\n      protested against the decisions of the Diet.\r\n\r\n  353 Schmidt, _Zur Geschichte des Schmalkaldischen Bundes_ (_Forsch. zur\r\n      Deutschen Geschichte_, XXV.); Zangemeister, _Die Schmalkaldischen\r\n      Artikel von 1537_ (Heidelberg, 1883); _Corpus Reformatorum_, iii.\r\n      973 ff.\r\n\r\n  354 Winckelmann, “Die Verträge von Kadan und Wien” (_Zeitschrift für\r\n      Kirchengeschichte_, xi. 212 ff.).\r\n\r\n  355 Cf.

Hessen_ (Paderborn\r\n      (1869)).\r\n\r\n  358 Luther’s action is usually attributed to his desire not to offend a\r\n      powerful Protestant leader. A careful study of the original\r\n      documents in the case—correspondence and papers—does not confirm\r\n      this view. To my mind, they show on Luther’s part a somewhat sullen\r\n      and crabbed conscientious fidelity to a conviction which he always\r\n      maintained. With all his reverence for the word of God, he could\r\n      never avoid giving a very large authority to the traditions of the\r\n      Church when they did not plainly contradict a positive and direct\r\n      divine commandment. The Church had been accustomed to say that it\r\n      possessed a dispensing power in matrimonial cases of extreme\r\n      difficulty; and, in spite of his denunciations of the dispensations\r\n      granted by the Roman Curia, Luther never denied the power. On the\r\n      contrary, he thought honestly that the Church did possess this power\r\n      of dispensation even to the length of tampering with a fundamental\r\n      law of Christian society, provided it did not contradict a\r\n      _positive_ scriptural commandment to the contrary. The crime of the\r\n      Curia, in his eyes, was not issuing dispensations in _necessary\r\n      cases_, but in giving them in cases without proved necessity, _and\r\n      for money_.\r\n\r\n  359 Ranke has an interesting study of the character of Maurice in his\r\n      _Deutsche Geschichte im Zeitalter der Reformation_, bk. ix. chap.\r\n      vi. (vol. v. pp. 161 ff. of the 6th ed., Leipzig, 1882); but perhaps\r\n      the best is given in Maurenbrecher, _Studien und Skizzen zur\r\n      Geschichte der Reformationszeit_ (Leipzig, 1874), pp. 135 ff. A\r\n      man’s deep religious convictions can tolerate strange company in\r\n      most ages, and the fact that we find Romanist champions in France\r\n      plunging into the deepest profligacy the one week and then\r\n      undergoing the agonies of repentance the next, or that Lutheran\r\n      leaders combined occasional conjugal infidelities and drinking bouts\r\n      with zeal for evangelical principles, demands deeper study in\r\n      psychology than can find expression, in the fashion of some modern\r\n      English historians, in a few cheap sneers.\r\n\r\n  360 Henninjard, _Correspondance des Reformateurs dans les pays de langue\r\n      française_ (Geneva and Paris, 1866-1897), i. 47, 48.\r\n\r\n_  361 Letters and Papers, Foreign and Domestic, of the reign of Henry\r\n      __VIII._, iii. 284.\r\n\r\n  362 Kalkoff, _Die Depeschen des Nuntius Aleander_ (Halle, 1897), p. 106.\r\n\r\n_  363 Acts of the Parliament of Scotland_ for 1525 and 1527.\r\n\r\n  364 Maurenbrecher, _Karl V. und die deutschen Protestanten 1545-1555_\r\n      (Düsseldorf, 1865): Jahn, _Geschichte des Schmalkaldischen Krieges_\r\n      (Leipzig, 1837); Lo Mang, _Die Darstcllung des Schmalkaldischen\r\n      Krieges in den Denkwürdigkeiten Karls V._ (Jena, 1890, 1899, 1900);\r\n      Brandenburg, _Moritz von Sachsen_ (Leipzig, 1898).\r\n\r\n  365 Schmidt, “Agenda and Letters relating to the _Interim_,” in\r\n      _Zeitschrift für historisch.

The Lutheran form of faith was\r\n      recognised to be a _religio licita_ (to use the old Roman phrase)\r\n      within the Holy Roman Empire, which, according to the legal ideas of\r\n      the day, included all Western Christendom; and Popes could no longer\r\n      excommunicate Protestants simply because they were Protestants,\r\n      without striking a serious blow at the constitution of the Empire.\r\n      No one perceived this sooner than the sagacious young woman who\r\n      became the first Protestant Queen of England. In the earlier and\r\n      unsettled years of her reign, Elizabeth made full use of the\r\n      protection that a profession of the Lutheran Creed gave to shield\r\n      her from excommunication. She did so when the Count de Feria, the\r\n      ambassador of Philip II., threatened her with the fate of the King\r\n      of Navarre (_Calendar of Letters and State Papers relating to\r\n      English Affairs, preserved principally in the Archives of Simancas_,\r\n      i. 61, 62); she suppressed all opinions which might be supposed to\r\n      conflict with the Lutheran Creed in the Thirty-eight Articles of\r\n      1563; she kept crosses and lights on the altar of her chapel in\r\n      Lutheran fashion. When the Pope first drafted a Bull to\r\n      excommunicate the English Queen, and submitted it to the Emperor, he\r\n      was told that it would be an act of folly to publish a document\r\n      which would invalidate the Emperor’s own election; and when\r\n      Elizabeth was finally excommunicated in 1570, the charge against her\r\n      was not being a Protestant, but sharing in “the impious mysteries of\r\n      Calvin”—the Reformed or Calvinist Churches being outside the Peace\r\n      of Augsburg.\r\n\r\n  372 SOURCES: Richter, _Die evangelischen Kirchenordnungen des\r\n      sechszehnten Jahrhunderts_ (Weimar, 1846); Sehling, _Die\r\n      evangelischen Kirchenordnungen des 16ten Jahrhunderts_ (Leipzig,\r\n      1902); Kins, “Das Stipendiumwesen in Wittenberg und Jena ... im\r\n      16ten Jahrhundert” (_Zeitschrift für historische Theologie_, xxxv.\r\n      (1865) pp. 96 ff.); G.

Where is it to be found?” Three hundred and\r\n      eleven clergymen were asked these questions, and only fifty answered\r\n      them all; out of the fifty, nineteen are noted as having answered\r\n      _mediocriter_. Eight could not answer a single one of them; and\r\n      while one knew that the number of the commandments was ten, he knew\r\n      nothing else [_English Historical Review_ for 1904 (Jan.), pp. 98\r\n      ff.].\r\n\r\n  378 Sehling, _Die evangelischen Kirchenordnungen des 16ten Jahrhunderts_\r\n      (Leipzig, 1902), I. i. 142 ff.\r\n\r\n_  379 Ibid._ I. i. 49.\r\n\r\n  380 The rites and ceremonies of worship in the Lutheran churches are\r\n      given in Daniel, _Codex Liturgicus Ecclesiæ Lutheranæ in epitomen\r\n      redactus_, which forms the second volume of his _Codex Liturgicus\r\n      Ecclesiæ Universæ_ (Leipzig, 1848).\r\n\r\n  381 The ordinance establishing the Wittenberg Consistory will be found\r\n      in Richter, _Die evangelischen Kirchenordnungen des sechszehnten\r\n      Jahrhunderts_ (Weimar, 1846), i. 367; and in Sehling, _Die\r\n      evangelischen Kirchenordnungen des 16ten Jahrhunderts_ (Leipzig,\r\n      1902), I. i. 200.

In his experimental moods, when he is the great\r\n      revivalist preacher, exhibited in his sermons on the _Song of Songs_\r\n      and elsewhere, everything that the Christian can do, say, or think,\r\n      comes from the revelation of God’s grace within the individual,\r\n      while in his more purely theological works he scarcely ever frees\r\n      himself from the entanglements of Scholastic Theology. The\r\n      doubleness in Bernard has been dwelt upon by A.

The Lutherans, always\r\n      late in discerning the true doctrinal bearings of their religious\r\n      certainties, did not deem it needful to assert dogmatically the\r\n      supreme authority of Scripture until the second generation of\r\n      Protestantism. The Schmalkald Articles and the Augsburg Confession\r\n      expressly assert that human traditions are among abuses that ought\r\n      to be done away with; but they do not condemn them as authorities\r\n      set up by their opponents in opposition to the word of God, only as\r\n      things that burden the conscience and incline men to false ways of\r\n      trying to be at peace with God (_Augsburg Confession_, as given in\r\n      Schaff, _The Creeds of the Evangelical Protestant Churches_, p. 65;\r\n      _Schmalkald Articles_, xv.). It was not until 1576, in the Torgau\r\n      Book, and in 1580 in the _Formula Concordiæ_, that they felt the\r\n      necessity of declaring dogmatically and in opposition to the Roman\r\n      Catholics that “the only standard by which all dogmas and all\r\n      teachers must be valued and judged is no other than the prophetic\r\n      and apostolic writings of the Old and of the New Testaments” (§ 1).\r\n\r\n      Zwingli, with the clearer dogmatic insight which he always showed,\r\n      felt the need of a statement about the theological place of\r\n      Scripture very early, and declared in the _First Helvetic\r\n      Confession_ (1536) that “Canonic Scripture, the word of God, given\r\n      by the Holy Spirit and set forth to the world by the prophets and\r\n      apostles, the most perfect and ancient of all philosophies, alone\r\n      contains perfectly all piety and the whole rule of life.” The\r\n      various Reformed Confessions, inspired by Calvin, followed Zwingli’s\r\n      example, and the supreme authority of Scripture was set forth in all\r\n      the symbolical books of the Reformed Churches of Switzerland,\r\n      France, England, the Netherlands, Scotland, etc.—_The Geneva\r\n      Confession_ of 1536 (Art. 1), _The Second Helvetic Confession_ of\r\n      1562 (Art. 1), _The French Confession_ of 1559 (Arts. 3-6), _The\r\n      Belgic Confession_ of 1561 (Arts. 4-7), _The Thirty-nine Articles\r\n      of_ 1563 and 1571 (Art. 6), _The Scots Confession_ of 1560 (Art.\r\n      19). It is instructive, however, to note how this is done. The key\r\n      to the central note in all these dogmatic statements is to be found\r\n      in the first and second of _The Sixty-seven Theses_ published in\r\n      1523 by Zwingli at Zurich, where it is declared that all who say\r\n      that the Evangel is of no value apart from its confirmation by the\r\n      Church err and blaspheme against God, and where the sum of the\r\n      Evangel is “that our Lord Jesus Christ, very Son of God, has\r\n      revealed to us the will of the heavenly Father, and with His\r\n      innocence has redeemed us from death and has reconciled us to God.”\r\n      The main thought, therefore, in all these Confessions is not to\r\n      assert the formal supremacy of Scripture over Tradition, but rather\r\n      to declare the supreme value of Scripture which reveals God’s good\r\n      will to us in Jesus Christ to be received by faith alone over all\r\n      human traditions which would lead us astray from God and from true\r\n      faith. The Reformers had before them not simply the theological\r\n      desire to define precisely the nature of that authority to which all\r\n      Christian teaching appeals, but the religious need to cling to the\r\n      divinely revealed way of salvation and to turn away from all human\r\n      interposition and corruption. They desire to make known that they\r\n      trust God rather than man. Hence almost all of them are careful to\r\n      express clearly the need for the Witness of the Holy Spirit.\r\n\r\n  422 Compare especially the discussions in the first part of the Second\r\n      Book of the _Summa_.\r\n\r\n  423 Harnack, _History of Dogma_, vii. 173-174.\r\n\r\n_  424 Luther’s Works_ (Erlangen edition), Latin, xxxvi. 506: “Quodsi odit\r\n      anima mea vocem homoousion, et nolim ea uti, non ero hæreticus, quis\r\n      enim me coget uti, modo rem teneam, quæ in concilio per scripturas\r\n      definita est?” It may be remarked that Athanasius himself did not\r\n      like the word that has become so associated with his name.\r\n\r\n_  425 Luther’s Works_ (2nd Erlangen edition), vi. 358: “Dreyfaltigkeit\r\n      ist ein recht böse Deutsch, denn in der Gottheit ist die höchste\r\n      Einigkeit.
