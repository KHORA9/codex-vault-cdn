J. Clarke Publishing Company\r\nMontreal Vancouver Chicago\r\n1914\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE\r\n\r\n\r\nThe history of “Montreal Under British Rule” is the “Tale of Two\r\nCities”, of a dual civilization with two main racial origins, two\r\nmentalities, two main languages, and two main religions. It is\r\nthe story of two dominant races growing up side by side under the\r\nsame flag, jealously preserving their identities, at some times\r\nmistrusting one another, but on the whole living in marvelous\r\nharmony though not always in unison, except on certain well\r\ndefined common grounds of devotion to Canada and the Empire, and\r\nof the desire of maintaining the noble traditions and the steady\r\nprogress of their city.\r\n\r\nMontreal of today is a cosmopolitan city, but it is\r\npreponderatingly French-Canadian in its population. This fact\r\nmakes it necessary to give especial attention to the history of\r\ntwo-thirds of the people. There has, therefore, been an effort in\r\nthese pages, while recognizing this, to respect the rights of the\r\nminority, and open-handed justice has been observed.\r\n\r\nThe position of a dispassionate onlooker has been taken as far\r\nas possible in the narration of the domestic struggles in the\r\nupbuilding of the city through the crucial turnstiles of Canadian\r\nhistory under British rule--the Interregnum, the establishment\r\nof civil government, the Quebec act, the Constitutional act,\r\nthe Union, and the Confederation. This attitude of equipoise,\r\nwhile disappointing to partisans, has been justified if it helps\r\nto present an unbiased account of different periods of history\r\nand serves to maintain the city’s motto of “Concordia Salus”--a\r\ndoctrine which has been upheld throughout this work. _Tout savoir\r\nc’est tout pardonner._\r\n\r\nCharles Dickens in his visit to Montreal in 1842 observed that\r\nit was a “heart-burning town.” There is no need to renew the\r\noccasion for such a title in the city of today.\r\n\r\nIt only remains to express thankful indebtedness to those, too\r\nnumerous to mention, who have assisted in the compilation of\r\ncertain information otherwise difficult of access, and also to\r\nthank a number of friends, prominent citizens of Montreal, who\r\nin connection with the movement for city improvement and the\r\ninculcation of civic pride have encouraged the author to embark\r\non the laborious but pleasant task of preparing this second\r\nvolume of the history of “Montreal Under British Rule,” as a\r\nsequel to the first volume of “Montreal Under the French Régime.”\r\n\r\n                                       WILLIAM HENRY ATHERTON.\r\n  December, 1914.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE TO THE READER\r\n\r\n\r\nIn presenting the second volume to the reader the writer would\r\nobserve that its first part deals mainly with the story of city\r\nprogress under the various changes of the political and civic\r\nconstitution, with certain chapters of supplementary annals and\r\nsidelights of general progress. The second part treats in detail,\r\nfor the sake of students and as a reference book, the special\r\nadvancement of the city through its various eras in religion,\r\neducation, culture, population, public service, hospital,\r\ncharitable, commercial, financial, transportation and city\r\nimprovement growth, and in so doing the author has desired to\r\npresent the histories of the chief associations that have in the\r\npast or in the present been mainly responsible for the upbuilding\r\nof a no mean city.\r\n\r\n                                                       W.H.A.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                            CONTENTS\r\n\r\n\r\n                             PART I\r\n\r\n                CONSTITUTIONAL AND CIVIC PROGRESS\r\n\r\n\r\n                            CHAPTER I\r\n\r\n                    THE EXODUS FROM MONTREAL\r\n\r\n                              1760\r\n\r\n          “THE OLD ORDER CHANGETH, GIVING PLACE TO NEW”\r\n\r\n  AMHERST’S LETTER REVIEWING EVENTS LEADING UP TO THE\r\n    CAPITULATION--THE SURRENDER OF ARMS--THE REVIEW OF BRITISH\r\n    TROOPS--THE DEPARTURE OF THE FRENCH TROOPS--END OF THE\r\n    PECULATORS--VAUDREUIL’S CAPITULATION CENSURED--DEPARTURE OF\r\n    THE PROVINCIAL TROOPS--ARRANGEMENTS FOR THE GOVERNMENT OF THE\r\n    COLONY--DEPARTURE OF AMHERST--THE TWO RACES LEFT BEHIND.

On the 9th the victorious Amherst wrote his official\r\naccount to the Honourable Lieutenant Governor Hamilton. The\r\ndetails therein will serve to recapitulate the history of the\r\nfinal downpour on Montreal during the days preceding its fall,\r\nwith the new era commencing, and accordingly we present it to our\r\nreaders.\r\n\r\n                                     “Camp of Montreal,\r\n                                             9th September, 1760.\r\n\r\n  Sir:\r\n\r\n  In Mine of the 26th ultimo I acquainted You with the progress of\r\n  the Army after the departure from Oswego and with the Success of\r\n  His Majesty’s Arms against Fort Levis, now Fort William Augustus,\r\n  where I remained no longer than was requisite to make Such\r\n  preparations as I Judged Essentially necessary for the passage of\r\n  the army down the River, which took me up to the 30th.\r\n\r\n  In the morning of the following day I set out and proceeded from\r\n  Station to Station to our present Ground, where we arrived on the\r\n  6th in the evening, after having in the passage sustained a loss\r\n  of Eighty-Eight men drowned,----Batteaus of Regts. seventeen of\r\n  Artillery, with Some Artillery Stores, Seventeen Whaleboats, one\r\n  Row Galley staved, Occasioned by the Violence of the Current and\r\n  the Rapids being full of broken Waves.\r\n\r\n  The Inhabitants of the Settlements I passed thro’ in my way\r\n  hither having abandoned their Houses and run into the Woods I\r\n  sent after them; Some were taken and others came of their own\r\n  Accord. I had them disarmed and Caused the oath of Allegiance to\r\n  be tendered to them, which they readily took; and I accordingly\r\n  put them in quiet possession of their Habitations, with Which\r\n  treatment they seemed no less Surprised than happy. The troops\r\n  being formed and the Light Artillery brought up, the Army lay on\r\n  their Arms till the Night of the 6th.\r\n\r\n  On the 7th, in the morning, two Officers came to an advanced post\r\n  with a Letter from the Marquis de Vaudreuil referring me to what\r\n  one of them, Colonel Bouguinville, had to say. The Conversation\r\n  ended with a Cessation of Arms till 12 o’Clock, when the\r\n  Proposals were brought in; Soon after I returned them with the\r\n  terms I was willing to grant, Which both the Marquis de Vaudreuil\r\n  and Mons. de Lévis, the French General, were very strenuous to\r\n  have softened; this Occasioned Sundry Letters to Pass between us\r\n  During the day as well as the Night (when the Army again lay on\r\n  their Arms), but as I would not on any Account deviate in the\r\n  Least from my Original Conditions and I insisted on an Immediate\r\n  and Categorical answer Mr. de Vaudreuil, soon after daybreak,\r\n  Notified to me that he had determined to Accept of them and two\r\n  Sets of them were accordingly Signed by him and me and Exchanged\r\n  Yesterday when Colonel Haldimand, with the Grenadiers and the\r\n  Light Infantry of the Army took Possession of One of the Gates of\r\n  the town and is this day to proceed in fulfilling the Articles\r\n  of the Capitulation; By which the French Troops are all to lay\r\n  down their arms; are not to serve during the Continuance of the\r\n  Present War and are to be sent back to Old France as are also\r\n  the Governors and Principal Officers of the Legislature of the\r\n  Whole Country, Which I have now the Satisfaction to inform You\r\n  is entirely Yielded to the Dominion of His Majesty. On which\r\n  Interesting and happy Event I most Sincerely Congratulate you.\r\n\r\n  Governor Murray, with the Troops from Quebec, landed below the\r\n  Town on Sunday last & Colonel Haviland with his Corps (that took\r\n  possession of the Isle aux Noix, Abandoned by the enemy on the\r\n  28th) Arrived Yesterday at the South Shore Opposite to My Camp. I\r\n  am, with great regard,\r\n\r\n                   Sir,\r\n                     Your most Obedient,\r\n                                 Humble Servant\r\n                                                     JEFF AMHERST.\r\n\r\n  The Honourable Lt. Governor Hamilton.\r\n\r\n(Endorsed by Hamilton, Camp Montreal, 7 ber, 1776. General\r\nAmherst, received by Post Tuesday, 23d September.)”[1]\r\n\r\nHaldimand, as directed by Amherst on the 9th, received the\r\nsubmission of the troops of France.\r\n\r\nIn the French camp, de Lévis reviewed his forces--2,132 of all\r\nranks. In his Journal they are thus summarized:\r\n\r\n  Officers present                                    179\r\n  Soldiers                                           1953\r\n                                                     ----\r\n                                                               2132\r\n\r\n  Officers returned to France                          46\r\n  Soldiers invalided                                  241\r\n                                                     ----\r\n                                                                287\r\n                                                               ----\r\n         Total                                                 2419\r\n  Soldiers described as absent from their regiments             927\r\n                                                               ----\r\n                                                               3346\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FORTIFICATIONS OF MONTREAL, 1760]\r\n\r\nThere on the Place d’Armes yielded up their arms, all that was\r\nleft of the brave French warriors who had no dishonour in their\r\nsubmission, surrendering only to the overwhelming superior\r\nnumbers of the English conquerors. With de Lévis was the able\r\nde Bourlamaque and the scholarly soldier de Bougainville, with\r\nDumas, Rocquemaure, Pouchot, Luc de la Corne and so many of the\r\nheroes of Ticonderoga and Carillon. There too was de Vaudreuil,\r\nthe Governor General, Commander-in-Chief, and last governor of\r\nNew France, with his brother, the last Governor of Montreal under\r\nthe Old Régime. Haviland’s entourage and the British troops\r\npresent could not but admire their late opponents.\r\n\r\nThe only jarring note of the ceremony was the absence of the\r\nFrench flags from the usual paraphernalia to be delivered up.\r\nThe omission is thus signaled by Amherst, in his official report\r\nof the submission, who after mentioning the surrender of the\r\ntwo captured British American stands of colours goes on to say\r\nthat there were no French colours forthcoming: “The Marquis de\r\nVaudreuil, generals and commanding officers of the regiment,\r\ngiving their word of honour that the battalions had not any\r\ncolours; they had brought them with them six years ago; they were\r\ntorn to pieces and finding them troublesome in this country they\r\nhad destroyed them.”\r\n\r\nThey had however been but recently destroyed, for the “Journal”\r\nof de Lévis, written by him Cæsar-like in the third person,\r\ntells how, after being unable to shake the determination of de\r\nVaudreuil to capitulate without the honours of war, de Lévis,\r\nin order to spare his troops a portion of the humiliation they\r\nwere to undergo, had ordered them to burn their colours to avoid\r\nthe hard condition of handing them over to the enemy. “_M. le\r\nChevalier de Lévis voyant avec douleur que rien ne pouvoit faire\r\nchanger la determination de M. le Marquis de Vaudreuil voulant\r\népargner aux troupes une partie de l’humiliation quelles alloient\r\nsubir, leur ordonna de brûler leurs drapeaux pour se soustraire à\r\nla dure condition de les remettre aux ennemis._”[2] (_Cf. Journal\r\ndes Campagnes du Chevalier de Lévis en Canada, 1756-1760. Edited\r\nby l’Abbé H.R. Casgrain, Montreal, C.O. Beauchemin et fils,\r\n1889._)\r\n\r\nOn the 11th Amherst turned out his whole force and received\r\nVaudreuil on parade. Between these two, friendly relations had\r\nbeen established. Place d’Armes was again a scene of colour with\r\nthe presence of the British regiments led by Murray, Haviland,\r\nBurton, Gage, Fraser the gallant Highlander, Guy Carleton, who\r\nwas to become the famous viceroy of Canada and to die Lord\r\nDorchester, Lord Howe, and the scholarly Swiss soldier Haldimand.\r\nThere were present, too, Sir William Johnston, the baronet of the\r\nMohawk Valley and leader of the six nations, Major Robert Rogers\r\nof the famous rangers,[3] with his two brothers, and others\r\nof note. No doubt de Vaudreuil’s suite was not far off with\r\nde Lévis, de Bourlamaque, de Bougainville, Dumas, Roquemaure,\r\nPouchot, Luc de la Corne, with the nefarious Intendant Bigot\r\nand all the principal officers of the colony who had been in\r\nMontreal, the headquarters of government since the fall of Quebec.\r\n\r\nDuring the three following days the town was definitely occupied\r\nby the British, and the arrangements completed for the departure\r\nof the French Regulars. The regiments of Languedoc and Berry,\r\nwith the marine corps, were embarked on the 13th; the regiments\r\nof Royal Rousillon and Guyenne on the 14th; on the 16th the\r\nregiments of La Reine and Béarn. On the 17th de Lévis, with de\r\nBourlamaque, started for Quebec; de Vaudreuil and Bigot left on\r\nthe 20th and 21st. By the 22nd every French soldier had left\r\nMontreal, except those who had married in the country and who had\r\nresolved to remain in it and transfer their allegiance to the new\r\ngovernment.[4]\r\n\r\nFate had dealt a severe blow to the brave defenders of Canada\r\nwhom we now find sailing from Montreal to France, which would\r\nappear to have abandoned them. The regulars and the colonial\r\ntroops, in spite of their jealousies and emulations, were brave\r\nmen, and duly honoured as such by the British soldiery who saw\r\nthe vessels bearing on the broad St. Lawrence so many of those\r\nwho had recently disputed the long drawn out strife for the\r\nconquest of Canada. Speaking of this, “the most picturesque\r\nand dramatic of American wars,” Parkman continues: “There is\r\nnothing more noteworthy than the skill with which the French\r\nand Canadian leaders use their advantages; the indomitable\r\nspirit with which, slighted and abandoned as they were, they\r\ngrappled with prodigious difficulties and the courage with which\r\nthey were seconded by regulars and militia alike. In spite of\r\noccasional lapses, the defence of Canada deserves a tribute of\r\nadmiration.”--(“Montcalm and Wolfe,” Vol. II, p. 382.)\r\n\r\nThe departures from Montreal and Quebec must have been indeed\r\nheart-rending. That from Montreal, since the fall of Quebec,\r\nthe home of all the high officials of the civil, religious and\r\nmilitary governments, was the most striking, as the natural\r\nleaders of the colony were mostly there. “There repassed into\r\nEurope,” says the French Canadian historian, F.X. Garneau, “about\r\n185 officers, 2,400 soldiers valid and invalid, and fully 500\r\nsailors, domestics, women and children. The smallness of this\r\nproved at once the cruel ravages of the war, the paucity of\r\nembarkations of succour sent from France, and the great numerical\r\nsuperiority of the victor. The most notable colonists at the\r\nsame time left the country. Their emigration was encouraged,\r\nthat of the Canadian officers especially, whom the conquerors\r\ndesired to be rid of and whom they eagerly stimulated to pass to\r\nFrance. Canada lost by this self-expatriation the most precious\r\nportion of its people, invaluable as its members were from their\r\nexperience, their intelligence and their knowledge of public and\r\ncommercial affairs.”[5] (Bell’s translation, Vol. II, p. 294.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SIR GUY CARLETON]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GENERAL JAMES MURRAY]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LORD JEFFREY AMHERST]\r\n\r\nThe clergy, however, solidly remained at their posts to build up\r\nthe self-esteem of the people and to rear up a loyal race. Hence\r\nthe respect and gratitude due to them by the French Canadians of\r\ntoday.\r\n\r\nYet there were many of whom the country was well rid, such as\r\nBigot, Cadet, Péan, Bréard, Varin, Le Mercier, Pénisseault,\r\nMaurin, Corpron and others, accused of the frauds and peculations\r\nthat helped to ruin Canada. A great sigh of relief might well\r\nhave escaped from the French who had been ruined by them.\r\n\r\nMost of the ships provided by the English government weathered\r\nthe November gales. The vessel L’Auguste containing Saint-Luc de\r\nla Corne, his brother, and others, after being storm-tossed and\r\nsaved from conflagration, finally drove towards the shore, struck\r\nand rolled on its side, and became wrecked on the Cap du Nord,\r\nIle Royale. La Corne, with six others, gained the shore, and he\r\nreached Quebec before the end of the winter, as his journal tells\r\nus. His name was to become familiar at Montreal under the British\r\nrégime.\r\n\r\nThe sloop Marie, which had been fitted up to receive the Marquis\r\nde Vaudreuil, his family and staff, had an early mishap between\r\nMontreal and Three Rivers, having run aground.\r\n\r\nM. de Vaudreuil and the staff of officers of the colony arrived\r\nat Brest on the English vessel L’Aventure under a flag of\r\ntruce, with 142 passengers from Canada. Thence, de Vaudreuil\r\nwrote to the minister of mariné. On December 5th the latter\r\nwrote back acknowledging this letter and that of September\r\nfrom Montreal containing the articles of capitulation, with\r\npapers relating thereto. A précis of this letter to Vaudreuil\r\nreveals that, although the king was aware of the condition of\r\nthe colony, in default of the reinforcements it was unable to\r\nreceive, yet, after the hopes the governor had given, by his\r\nletters in the month of June, of holding out some time longer,\r\nand his assurances that the last efforts would be put forth to\r\nsustain the honour of the king before yielding, His Majesty\r\ndid not expect to learn so soon of the surrender of Montreal\r\nand of the whole colony. Granting the force of all the reasons\r\nwhich led to the capitulation, the king was nevertheless\r\nconsiderably surprised, and less satisfied, at having to submit\r\nto conditions so little to his honour, especially in the face\r\nof the representations which had been made to him by M. de\r\nLévis on behalf of the military corps of the colony. The king,\r\nin reading the memorandum of these representations, which the\r\nminister was unable to avoid placing before him, saw in it that,\r\nnotwithstanding the slight hope of success, Vaudreuil was still\r\nin a condition, with the diminished resources remaining to\r\nhim, to attempt an attack or a defence that might have brought\r\nthe English to grant a capitulation that would have been more\r\nhonourable for the troops. The king left him at liberty to\r\nremain at Brest for the time, for his health. With regard to the\r\nofficers who were with him, they could retire to their families\r\nor elsewhere. It was sufficient for him to be informed of their\r\nplace of residence.--(“Canadian Archives,” Vol. III, p. 313.)\r\n\r\nNot only was Vaudreuil censured for the capitulation of\r\nMontreal, but finally he had the honour of being placed in the\r\nBastille with the peculators whom we have above mentioned.[6]\r\nHis release, however, was speedy. Whatever his gains might have\r\nbeen from trading in the early part of his career, e. g., as\r\nGovernor of Louisiana, he reached France from his government\r\nof Canada a poor man. The trial of those accused of peculation\r\nlasted from December 1, 1761, till the end of March, and on\r\nDecember 10, 1763, the president of the commission rendered his\r\nfinal decision. Vaudreuil with five more were relieved from the\r\naccusation, but he died in 1764 less from age than from sorrow.\r\n\r\n“In the course of his trial he stood by the Canadian officers,\r\nnow being slandered by Bigot. ‘Brought up in Canada myself,’\r\nsaid the late Governor General, ‘I knew them, every one, and\r\nI maintain that almost all of them are as upright as they are\r\nvalorous; in general the Canadians seem to be soldiers born; a\r\nmasculine and military training early inures them to fatigues and\r\ndangers. The annals of their expeditions, their explorations, and\r\ntheir dealings with the aborigines abound in marvelous examples\r\nof courage, activity, patience under privation, coolness in\r\nperil, and obedience to leaders during services which have cost\r\nmany of them their lives, but without slackening the ardour of\r\nthe survivors. Such officers as these, with a handful of armed\r\ninhabitants and a few savage warriors, have often disconcerted\r\nthe projects, paralyzed the preparations, ravaged the provinces,\r\nand beaten the troops of Great Britain when eight or ten times\r\nmore numerous than themselves. In a country with frontiers\r\nso vast, such qualities were priceless.’ And he finished by\r\ndeclaring that he would fail in his duty to those generous\r\nwarriors, and even to the state itself, if he did not proclaim\r\ntheir services, their merits and their innocence.”--(Bell’s\r\ntranslation of Garneau, Vol. II, p. 298.)\r\n\r\nGovernor Carleton, writing in 1767 to Lord Shelburne, confirms\r\nthis tribute. “The new subjects could send into the field about\r\neighteen thousand men well able to carry arms, of which number,\r\nabove one-half have already served with as much valour, with more\r\nzeal, and more military knowledge for America, than the regular\r\ntroops of France that were joined with them.”\r\n\r\nVaudreuil might also have paid a compliment to the brave women\r\nof New France, who, like Madeleine de Verchères and others, were\r\nready to fight with the men, and who were true women and wives.\r\n“Brave and beautiful,” George III summed them up in a compliment\r\npaid at his court in London after the conquest to Madame de Léry,\r\nthe wife of Chevalier de Léry, the engineer who repaired the\r\nfortifications of Montreal: “If all the Canadian ladies resemble\r\nyou, I have truly made a fine conquest.”\r\n\r\nIt must not be thought that the departure of the French colonial\r\nofficers was an entire abandonment of the project of regaining\r\nthe country. They were to be retained for the French service\r\nand possibly for future use in Canada.[7] They were called to\r\nTourraine and there held at the king’s pleasure under pay, to all\r\nintents and purposes officers in the French service, and liable\r\nto be sent on any service.\r\n\r\n“The British provincial troops were sent from Montreal at an\r\nearly date. The New Hampshire and Rhode Island regiments crossed\r\nthe river and proceeded to Chambly, thence went to Crown Point.\r\nThe Connecticut troops were ordered to Oswego and Fort Stanwix;\r\nthe New York and New Jersey regiments to the lately named Fort\r\nWilliam Augustus, at the head of the rapids, and to Oswegatchie\r\n(Ogdensburg). Rogers, with four hundred men, bearing letters from\r\nVaudreuil instructing the forts to be given over, was sent to\r\nDetroit, Miami, St. Joseph and Michillimackinac.[8] Moncton at\r\nthe same time received orders to forward regular troops to take\r\npermanent possession of these forts.”--(Kingsford, “History of\r\nCanada,” Vol. IV, p. 409.)\r\n\r\nThe troops that were to remain in Montreal for the winter were\r\nnow established in their quarters. The French Indians in the\r\nneighbourhood were summoned to the city and requested to bring\r\ntheir prisoners; they appeared with several men, women and\r\nchildren, and Johnston established rules and regulations for\r\ntheir future government.\r\n\r\nAmherst remained in Montreal till September 26th, when he went\r\ndown the river to Quebec. He left on October 5th and on the\r\n18th was on Lake Champlain, thence to Albany, which he left on\r\nthe 21st to arrive in New York on the 28th of October. He never\r\nvisited Canada again, but he left it, however, well organized.\r\n\r\nImmediately after the capitulation of Montreal he had occupied\r\nhimself with the establishment of a provisional military\r\ngovernment with tribunals to administer justice summarily until\r\na definite form of government should be determined. The French\r\ndivision of the province into the three administrative districts\r\nof Quebec, Three Rivers and Montreal was maintained. In a\r\ndespatch to Pitt dated October 4, 1760, from Quebec (Amériques\r\net Indes Occidentales, No. 699), Amherst renders an account of\r\nall the dispositions which he had made since the date of the\r\ncapitulation of Montreal. Although the greater part of these\r\nwere military matters, the following items concerning the civil\r\nadministration may be found:\r\n\r\nSeptember 15; I have sent officers with detachments to the\r\ndifferent villages to collect the arms and to make them take the\r\noath of allegiance.\r\n\r\nSeptember 16; I have named Colonel Burton governor of Three\r\nRivers.\r\n\r\nSeptember 17; I have given order to the militia of the town\r\n(Montreal) and of the suburbs to give up their arms and to\r\ntake the oath of allegiance next day, immediately after the\r\nembarkation of M. de Vaudreuil.\r\n\r\nSeptember 22; I have named Brigadier General Gage governor of\r\nMontreal.\r\n\r\nOn the same day he published a proclamation for the government\r\nof Three Rivers similar to the one for Montreal, dated merely\r\nSeptember, 1760 (“Amériques et Indes Occidentales”), in which\r\narrangements are made for the transaction of business and\r\namicable arrangements with the new government and the troops.\r\n\r\nThe new government was only, however, of an _ad interim_ nature,\r\nfor it was not certain that England would keep Canada. It was\r\nthis thought that reconciled the Canadians to the new situation.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the British Flag floated over Citadel Hill.\r\n\r\nThe country was now British. France had been tried in the balance\r\nand found wanting. It had lost, through its wavering policy, a\r\nfair domain and a noble people. This poignant loss was voiced by\r\nde Vaudreuil, the deposed governor general, who, in spite of his\r\nfaults, was a true Canadian and had visions of its future as one\r\nof the proudest jewels in the crown of France, for was it not La\r\nNouvelle France? On quitting his beloved country he paid it this\r\nhomage in a letter to his minister:\r\n\r\n“With these beautiful and vast countries, France loses 70,000\r\ninhabitants[9] of a rare quality; a race of people unequaled\r\nfor their docility, bravery and loyalty. The vexations they\r\nhave suffered for many years, more especially during the five\r\nyears preceding the reduction of Quebec--all without a murmur,\r\nor importuning the king for relief--sufficiently manifest their\r\nperfect submissiveness.”\r\n\r\nThe qualities, they had then, remain still the mark of those of\r\nthe same race living in Montreal of today.\r\n\r\n    “In all things we are sprung, from\r\n    Earth’s best blood, have titles manifold.”\r\n\r\nAs their predecessors took the oath of allegiance to King George\r\nII, and became good Britishers, so have their descendants\r\nremained today, in the days of George V. “What perished in\r\nthe capitulation of Montreal,” says Parkman, “was the Bourbon\r\nmonarchy and the narrow absolutism which fettered the life of\r\nNew France throughout the Old Régime. What survives today is the\r\nvigour of two races striving to make Canada strong and free and\r\nreverent of law.”\r\n\r\n\r\n                             NOTE I\r\n\r\n                   THE EXODUS AND THE REMNANT\r\n\r\nJudge Baby of Montreal, in an article in the Canadian Antiquarian\r\nand Numismatic Journal, 3d Edit., Vol. II, p. 304, has combatted\r\nvery successfully the traditional view started by Bibaud and\r\nfollowed by Garneau that after the capitulation of Montreal, and\r\nthe Treaty of Paris, 1763, the seigneurs, the men of learning,\r\nand the chief traders and others of the directing classes, left\r\nthe country. This emigration was from the town but the country\r\nplaces were untouched. He proves that a great many remained\r\noutside the civil and military party who had governed the\r\ncountry, and the soldiery who were taken officially to France;\r\nthat many of the young colonial officers who had thought to have\r\na chance to follow a career in the army or navy of France shortly\r\nreturned at the call of their fathers whose interest in their\r\nlands and whose poverty, heightened by the depreciation of the\r\npaper money, would not have induced them to begin life again in\r\nFrance; that even of those who did go to France there were very\r\nmany who returned, as they had intended; hence the recurrence\r\nof names, in the history after the cession, made familiar\r\nbefore it. The long list given by Judge Baby of Seigneurs and\r\ngentlemen proved by him to have remained, strengthens his case.\r\nAn interesting list of French-Canadians remaining in Montreal\r\nengaged in business at this time is also given by him as follows:\r\n\r\nGuy, Blondeau, Le Pellé De LaHaye, Lequindre Douville, Perthuis,\r\nNivard St. Dizier, Les freres Hervieux, Gaucher-Gamelin, Glasson,\r\nMoquin, St. Sauveur, Pothier, Lemoine de Monnière, De Martigny,\r\nDe Couagne, Desauniers, Mailhot, St. Ange-Charly, Dumas, Magnan,\r\nMitiver, L’Amy, Bruyère, Pierre Chaboillez, Fortier, Lefèbre du\r\nChouquet, Courtheau, Vallée, Cazeau, Charly, Carignan, Auger,\r\nPorlier frère, Pommereau, Larocque, Dumeriou, Roy-Portelance,\r\nDe Vienne, De Montforton, Sanguinet, Campeau, Laframboise,\r\nVauquier, Guillemain, Curot, Dufau, Campion, Lafontaine,\r\nTruillier-Lacombe, Périneault, Arillac, Léveillé, Bourassa,\r\nPillet, Hurtubise, Leduc, Monbrun, Landrieu, Mezière, Hilbert,\r\nTabeau, Sombrun, Marchesseau, Avrard, Lasselle, Dumas St.\r\nMartin, Beaubien-Desrivières, Réaume, Nolin, Cotté, St. Germain,\r\nDucalvet, L’Eschelle, Beaumont.\r\n\r\nThe Judge gives the names of many jurisconsults who remained\r\nin the country, three of whom eventually became members of\r\nthe Superior Council; also of doctors; the great majority of\r\nthe notaries remained in the country. In summing up, he finds\r\n“130 seigneurs, 100 gentry, 125 traders of mark, twenty-five\r\njurisconsults, and men of law, twenty-five to thirty doctors and\r\nsurgeons, notaries of almost the same number”--“were these not,”\r\nhe asks, “sufficient to face the political, intellectual and\r\nother needs of the population then in Quebec, Montreal and Three\r\nRivers?”\r\n\r\n\r\n                             NOTE II\r\n\r\n                POPULATION OF CANADA AT THE FALL\r\n\r\nM. de Vaudreuil’s estimate of 70,000 population has been\r\nchallenged by Dr. Kingsford (“History of Canada,” Vol. IV, p.\r\n413).\r\n\r\nAmherst before leaving Canada obtained a census of the population\r\nwhich he reported as 76,172 by parishes and districts.\r\n\r\n                         Companies  Number\r\n                            of        of      Total of\r\n                Parishes  Militia  Militia    all souls\r\n  Montreal        46        87      7,331      37,200\r\n  Three Rivers    19        19      1,105       6,388\r\n  Quebec          43        64      7,976      32,584\r\n                 ---       ---     ------      ------\r\n                 108       170     16,412      76,172\r\n\r\nThe census must have been obtained through the French and there\r\nis no ground for supposing that they would designedly furnish\r\nan incorrect statement. It does not, however, accord with the\r\nprevious or subsequent tables of population.\r\n\r\nThe population in 1736 was 39,063; 1737, 39,970; 1739, 42,701;\r\n1754, 55,009. In the fifteen years between the last two dates the\r\npopulation increased 12,003, something less than one-third. If\r\nwe apply this increase to the next six years we may be justified\r\nin estimating the increase at one-eighth, which would place\r\nthe population at 62,000. It is not provable that in these six\r\nyears of war the population could have increased upwards of\r\n20,000,--five-elevenths--nearly half of the former total. In 1761\r\nthe three governors were called upon to furnish a census of their\r\nseveral districts. The reports were:\r\n\r\n  (Gage) Montreal        24,957\r\n  (Burton) Three Rivers   6,612\r\n  (Murray) Quebec        30,211\r\n                         ------\r\n          Total of       61,780\r\n\r\n“I am inclined, therefore,” says Kingsford, “to estimate the\r\nFrench population of Canada in 1760 at 60,000 souls, the number\r\nof which hitherto has been generally accepted as correctly\r\nrepresenting it.”\r\n\r\nAt the same time Doctor Kingsford placed too much reliance on\r\nthe census of 1761. It is well known that fear of conscription\r\nand other bogies caused the census returns of French-Canadian\r\ninhabitants to be minimized for many a long day under British\r\nrule. If Amherst’s census of 76,172 is correct, as well as the\r\n61,780, that of the year 1761, then a loss of 14,392 is to be\r\naccounted for.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[1] From R.

All his\r\nordinances manifest the desire to act in accordance with justice\r\nand in harmony with the people. Montrealers recognized this and\r\nshortly after the death of George II, which took place on October\r\n25th, expressed their confidence in their rulers in an address\r\nwritten in English and French. The English version as inserted in\r\nthe New York Gazette is as follows:\r\n\r\n“To his Excellency, General Gage, governor of Montreal and its\r\ndependencies.\r\n\r\n“The address of the officers of militia and merchants of the city\r\nof Montreal.\r\n\r\n“Cruel Destiny has thus cutt short the Glorious Days of so Great\r\nand so Magnanimous a Monarch! We are come to pour out our Grief\r\nunto the paternal Bosom of Your Excellency, the Sole Tribute\r\nof Gratitude of a People who will never cease to Exalt the\r\nmildness and Moderation of their New Masters. The General who has\r\nconquered us has rather treated Us as a Father than a Vanquisher\r\nand has left us a precious Pledge[2] by name and deed of his\r\nGoodness to Us. What acknowledgements are we not beholden to make\r\nfor so many Favours? Ha! They shall be forever Engraven in our\r\nHearts in Indelible Characters. We Entreat Your Excellency to\r\ncontinue us the Honour of Your Protection. We will endeavour to\r\nDeserve it by Our Zeal and by the Earnest Prayers We shall ever\r\noffer up to the Immortal Being for Your Health and Preservation.”\r\n(Canadian Archives, A. & W., I, 96, I, page 327.)\r\n\r\nThe mildness and moderation of the “New Masters” was particularly\r\nshown by the retention of existing laws and customs. It will\r\nbe recalled that Vaudreuil, in the Articles of Capitulation\r\nhad asked that “French and Canadians should be _continued_ to\r\nbe governed according to the customs of Paris and the laws and\r\nusages established for this country and should not be subject\r\nto any other laws than those established under the French\r\ndominion.” Whereupon Amherst had replied that this had been\r\nanswered by the preceding article and especially by the reply\r\nto the last (Article 41), asking that the British government\r\nshould only require a strict neutrality of the Canadians, which\r\nsaid curtly: “They become subjects of the king”--a non-committal\r\nreply, which at first looked severe but was, as the conscientious\r\nhistorian, Jacques Viger,[3] has said, just and reasonable under\r\nthe circumstances. In the event, Amherst granted more than his\r\nanswer would suggest, for during the Interregnum, the French and\r\nBritish incomers continued to be governed according to the custom\r\nof Paris. Hence the gratitude expressed through General Gage was\r\nwell deserved.\r\n\r\nThe period of the Interregnum, now beginning (September 8, 1760,\r\nto August 10, 1764), which was to last until the promulgation of\r\nthe treaty of Paris, and the official publication by Governor\r\nGeneral Murray of his civil appointment, has been called\r\nerroneously by several French historians, “_La Regne Militaire_,”\r\na term suggestive of military despotism and summary justice.\r\nCommander Jacques Viger, M. Labrie, Judge Mondelet and others\r\nrejected this erroneous misnomer in the columns of the Journal\r\n“La Bibliotheque Canadienne,” being edited in 1827 by Bibaud,\r\nthe well known historian. For, after examining the documents\r\nof the period they came to the conclusion that the name of _La\r\nRegne Militaire_ could only be merited because, as most of the\r\nofficial men of the law having been in Government employ had left\r\nthe country and new justices had to be created who should judge\r\naccording to “_les lois, formes et usages_” of the country, the\r\ngovernment devolved perforce on the _military_ men and _of the_\r\n“_milices_,” the only educated men left besides the clergy.\r\n\r\nThis is made clear by a memoir of October 15, 1777, to the\r\nBritish government on the subject of the administration of\r\njustice, drawn up by Judges Panet, Mabane and Dunn, of whom\r\nPierre Panet had been one of the _greffiers_ at Montreal, and the\r\nothers had had close relations with the military judges. Their\r\ntestimony is therefore convincing. They state: “Though Canada\r\nwas conquered by His Majesty’s arms in the fall of 1760, the\r\nadministration in England did not interfere with the interior\r\ngovernment of it till the year 1763. It remained, during that\r\nperiod, as formerly, with three districts, under the separate\r\ncommand of military officers who established in their respective\r\ndistricts, military courts under different forms, indeed, but in\r\nwhich, _according to the policy observed in wise nations towards\r\na conquered people the laws and usages of Canada were observed in\r\nthe rules of decision_.”\r\n\r\nThe basis of the new military government was the placard issued\r\nby General Amherst from Montreal on the 22d of September, 1760,\r\nin which he announced the new order of the government for the\r\nold and new subjects, and outlined the new form of military\r\ngovernment throughout the three districts, by the appointment\r\nin each parish of the officers of the militia, the commandant\r\nof the regular troops and a third court of further appeal to\r\nthe governor, as the future demonstrators of justice, and then\r\nleft it to the local governors of the other two divisions of\r\nthe country to establish their own courts. These officers of\r\nmilitia were the most competent at the time to carry on the\r\ntraditional “custom of Paris” as they were mostly appointed from\r\nthe Seigneurs of the district and the educated class.\r\n\r\nAccordingly on October 28, 1760, General Gage issued his orders\r\nestablishing tribunals of militia officers to regulate civil\r\ndisputes among individuals and a second tribunal of appeal before\r\nthe regular military court, with a final court of appeal to\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\nThe rest of the document deals with police prohibitions to the\r\ninhabitants, not to harbour deserters or to traffic with the\r\nsoldiers for their arms, clothing, etc., or any other of their\r\naccoutrements; it orders chimneys to be swept once a month, and\r\nother precautions against fire; carpenters were to be prepared\r\nwith an adz, the inhabitants with an axe and bucket; also\r\narrangements for safety against snow from falling from houses,\r\nthe cleansing of the portions before the house and the disposal\r\nof garbage, the keeping of the roads and bridges in good order,\r\nand regulations concerning the sale of provisions brought in by\r\nthe country people, the sale to be made in the common market\r\nplace with the prohibition to town merchants to forestall the\r\ncitizens by buying up the supplies brought in. The militia\r\ncaptains being no lawyers, were only required by Amherst to\r\ndispense law and justice as best they could, being limited to\r\ncivil cases.\r\n\r\nThe ordinance of Thomas Gage, governing the administration of\r\njustice in his jurisdiction of Montreal by dividing it into\r\nfive districts with definite powers and the regulations for the\r\nupkeep of the courts therein, was dated at Montreal, October 13,\r\n1761. In each of the five districts there was to assemble on the\r\nfirst and fifteenth of each month a court of officers of the\r\n“_Milice_.” These militia courts were to be composed of not more\r\nthan seven and not less than five members, of which one should\r\nhold the rank of captain, the senior to act as president. The\r\nofficers of militia of each district were summoned to meet in\r\ntheir parishes on the 24th of October to make arrangements for\r\nthe whole of these courts and to prepare rosters of officers for\r\nduty therein.\r\n\r\nThe Town of Montreal was set apart as a judicial district of\r\nits own, with a local board of officers to administer the laws.\r\nAppeal was allowed from these courts to three boards of officers\r\nof His Majesty’s Troops, one to meet at Montreal, the other at\r\nVarennes and the third at St. Sulpice, these courts of appeal to\r\nsit on the 20th of each month. A further appeal from these courts\r\nto the governor in person was provided for.\r\n\r\nIn the event of capital crimes, officers of militia were\r\nauthorized to arrest the criminals and their accomplices and to\r\nconduct them under guard to Montreal, the militia officers to\r\nfurnish with each prisoner an account of the crime and a list of\r\nwitnesses. In civil cases involving small amounts, not exceeding\r\ntwenty _livres_ all the officers of the militia were individually\r\ngranted authority to adjudicate with an appeal to and no further\r\nthan the militia courts of the districts.\r\n\r\nProvision was made for the payment of the militia officers\r\nfor all of these duties by a scale of fees, a treasurer to be\r\nappointed for each court. The officers of militia were especially\r\nenjoined to maintain peace and order within their respective\r\ndistricts.\r\n\r\nOn October 17th the _Conseil des Capitaines de Milice de\r\nMontreal_ presented a memorial to the governor expressing their\r\nwillingness to administer justice gratuitously, as they had done\r\nin the past, but requesting as a favour from His Excellency that\r\nthey be exempted from the obligation to billet troops in their\r\ndomiciles. They requested that six cords of wood be purchased to\r\nheat the chamber in which their sittings were held and that Mr.\r\nPanet, their clerk, be compensated for his services at the rate\r\nof thirty _sols_ for each sentence. Two militia sergeants had\r\nbeen appointed to act as bailiffs and criers of the court, and\r\na tariff of fees was asked for to provide for their pay. These\r\nsergeants, it was also explained, were not only made use of in\r\nthe administration of justice but also for the district, for the\r\nsupervision of the statutory labour or _corvèe_. This memorial,\r\nwhich was signed “R. Decouange,” was approved by the governor.[4]\r\n\r\nThe inclusion of the French officers in the administration of\r\nthe affairs of the country was a wise and honest attempt on the\r\npart of the British to carry out the promise of the capitulation\r\nto retain for the present the laws and customs of the past. In\r\nchoosing the officers of the militia they were well advised,\r\nsince the commissions there were held by the Seigneurs and the\r\nother notabilities of their respective districts, men who were\r\nthe best educated and the most esteemed in the country. The\r\nchoice was politic also, for it secured the continuance of the\r\nservices of men who, under the old régime, had already been in\r\ncharge of the conduct of justice, as well as public and communal\r\naffairs. Indeed it was to them that there had been intrusted\r\nthe carrying out of the public works, such as road making and\r\nrepairs, bridge building, the regulation of statutory labor\r\nthrough corvèes, etc. In the new régime, therefore, the militia\r\nofficers were practically reinstated in their former functions.\r\n\r\nAn examination has been made by Judge Mondelet of Three Rivers,\r\nof the registers kept of the decisions of the military court of\r\nMontreal. These latter have been generally found equitable and\r\nfounded on positive law; they are legally attested to in most\r\ncases, the secretary of the council being a Frenchman skilled\r\nin the law, such as was Pierre Panet, the notary, and the\r\nminutes are all in French. The first four registers contain the\r\ntransactions of the “Chambre de Milices” presided over by the\r\ncaptains of the militia, and dealt only with civil cases. The\r\nfifth and sixth of these registers contain the criminal decisions\r\nof the court martials of the _Chambre Militaire_ of Montreal\r\nand that of St. Sulpice, as well as appeals from the “Chambre de\r\nMilices.” This court was composed only of officers of the regular\r\narmy to the number of five. In addition there was the further\r\nright of appeal to the governor. The seventh register “appeals to\r\nthe governor,” records the decisions of General Gage (page 299),\r\nand of General Burton (page 95).\r\n\r\nBy consulting the records we find that order during this period\r\nwas observed independently of the racial distinctions in the\r\ncity. We hear of, for instance, early in 1761 of the execution\r\nof a grenadier of the Forty-fourth Regiment for robbery, which\r\nis balanced by that of a French soldier, formerly of the La\r\nSalle Regiment, for the murder of a habitant at Ile Jésus, the\r\nexecution being carried out in the market place.\r\n\r\nIt will be interesting here to notice some of the court martials\r\nheld at Montreal in the years 1761 and 1762. It will be seen\r\nthat French and English, the “new” and the “old” subjects,\r\ncame equally under them, being treated with equal justice. The\r\nfollowing cases from the “Livre d’orde” reveal this.\r\n\r\nMontreal, June 3, 1761, at the court martial general,\r\nLieutenant-Colonel Grant presiding, Jean Marchand of\r\nBoucherville, was prosecuted for the murder of Joseph Carpentier,\r\na Canadian,--acquitted.\r\n\r\nTuesday, June 30, William Bewen accused of having intoxicated\r\nsoldiers and of selling rum without license, is found guilty,\r\nhaving been accessory to his associate, Isaac Lawrence, who has\r\nthe habit of selling rum to the soldiers,--condemned to receive\r\n200 stripes of the cat-o’-nine tails, and to be driven from the\r\ntown at the beat of the drum. (First of July, Isaac Lawrence\r\nsimilarly condemned.)\r\n\r\nAugust 6, Joseph Lavalleé and François Herpin, inhabitants of\r\nMontreal, prosecuted for theft,--acquitted.\r\n\r\nJoseph Burgen, one of those who came following the army, is\r\naccused and convicted for theft, and condemned to be hanged\r\nby the neck until death shall ensue. The General approved the\r\nsentence, but pardoned him on the condition that he left this\r\ngovernment without delay.\r\n\r\nAugust 13, George Skipper and Bellair, bakers, accused and\r\narraigned by Captain Disnay for having sold bread, which had not\r\nthe requisite weight,--acquitted.\r\n\r\nSeptember 19, John Charlette and one named Lameure, Canadians,\r\nare indicted for having solicited Joseph Myard, a drummer, to\r\ndesert. Charlette is acquitted and Lameure is found guilty and\r\ncondemned to receive 300 blows from the whip. He is pardoned by\r\nthe General.\r\n\r\nDecember 13, William Morris, accused of having kept a dissolute\r\nhouse, is condemned to a fine of £5.\r\n\r\nDecember 24, two Canadians prosecuted for having the property\r\nof the King in their possession. One is acquitted and the other\r\nfound guilty and condemned to receive 400 stripes of the lash.\r\nThe General approves the sentence, but reduces the lashes to\r\nfifty.\r\n\r\nFor 1762, we may choose an incident which shows the growth of the\r\ntendency towards the unpleasant relations between the Montreal\r\nEnglish merchants and the military, which afterwards had such\r\nserious results, and helped to occasion the recall of General\r\nMurray.\r\n\r\nFebruary 26, Mr. Grant and Edward Chinn, merchants, accused of\r\nhaving insulted Ensign Nott of the Fourth Battalion of the Sixth\r\nRegiment of Royal Americans, are found guilty and condemned, Mr.\r\nGrant to a fine of £30 and Mr. Chinn to a fine of £20, “which\r\nsums will be employed according to the direction of the General\r\nto the relief of the unhappy poor in Montreal.” Pardon is to be\r\nasked of Ensign Nott in the presence of the garrison of Montreal\r\nin the following terms, namely--“Ensign Nott I am very sorry for\r\nhaving been guilty of assault in your regard and very humbly ask\r\nyour pardon.” The General approved the sentence, but reduced the\r\nfine of Mr. Grant to £20. Mr. Forrest Oakes was also prosecuted\r\nfor a like offence and condemned also to ask pardon of Ensign\r\nNott, and to undergo fourteen days’ imprisonment. The General\r\nreduced the imprisonment to twenty-four hours and exempted Mr.\r\nOakes from asking pardon, because it appeared to him that the\r\ninjuries received had been reciprocal.\r\n\r\nFrom these judgments, we may see that, while the Chambre de\r\nJustice of Chambre de Milices judged purely civil affairs, all\r\ncriminal affairs, great and small, were relegated to the “Council\r\nof War,” otherwise called the “Court Martial,” which performed\r\nthe functions nowadays of the courts of Quarter Sessions and\r\ncriminal courts of King’s Bench. The “General” was the final\r\ncourt of appeal.\r\n\r\nA glance at some of the ordinances of this period will further\r\nillustrate the life of the town. On November 27 Governor Gage\r\nfound it necessary to issue ordinances against merchants,\r\nwho without permission of the governor, went to sell their\r\nmerchandise and intoxicating liquors in the country places. On\r\nthe 13th of January, 1762, there occurred a further ordinance,\r\nexplaining the former and forbidding in addition the sale of\r\nliquors to soldiers and savages, and fixing the quantity lawful\r\nto be sold to the inhabitants at one time. These merchants\r\nwere probably newcomers from the English colonies now drifting\r\ninto the city and anxious to make good quickly rather than\r\nscrupulously.\r\n\r\nOn the 12th of May regulations were issued concerning the amount\r\nof cords of wood that should be furnished to the troops.\r\n\r\nOn July 26th, Gage endeavors to arrange for the money exchange\r\nvalues. He orders that six _livres tournois_ shall be equal to\r\neight shillings, or ten _sols_ of Montreal money.\r\n\r\nOn July 31st, Gage has his mind on the repair of the\r\nfortifications, “seeing that they are falling into ruin and\r\nwishing to carry on the old regulations for the common good,\r\nfollowing in this time of uncertainty, the ancient usages, which\r\nare not opposed to the service of the king,” and therefore he\r\nordered that there shall be imposed every year commencing with\r\n1762, a sum, of which a third shall be paid by the Seminary of\r\nSt. Sulpice and the other two-thirds by the regular and secular\r\ncommunities and the inhabitants of the said Town of Montreal, for\r\nrepairs to commence in the following spring, but that the gate,\r\non which they are working, shall be made perfect this year, and\r\n“that the said imposition, for which the money shall be remitted\r\nto a person named by the Chambre of Militia of the said Montreal,\r\nshall not surpass the sum of 6,000 _livres_ each year” and shall\r\ncontinue until the entire repair of the said enclosure is made,\r\nat the end of which repairs, the present ordinance shall remain\r\nnull and void.\r\n\r\nOn August 3d, Gage seeing that different standards of weights and\r\nmeasures were being used, and to prevent frauds slipping into the\r\ncommercial life of the city, established that, in Montreal,\r\nthe English standard yard measure should be used according to the\r\nstandard to be kept by the “major of the place.” This regulation\r\nit was hoped would suit both the English and French.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: IN THE DAYS OF THE OLD REGIME St. Amable Street,\r\na narrow thoroughfare west of the lower part of Jaques Cartier\r\nSquare and near the spot where the Chateau de Vaudreuil once\r\nstood, was a fashionable quarter in the gay days before the\r\n“Capitulation.” The house marked by a projecting sign “The\r\nWoodbine” is said to have been the site of a saloon for two\r\nhundred years.]\r\n\r\nOn October 18th he has to settle the prices, which the bakers of\r\nthe town should charge for various kinds of bread.\r\n\r\nOn November 15th, foreseeing the future possibilities of Montreal\r\ntrade, Governor Gage issued an ordinance for the establishment of\r\na Customs House and he orders Thomas Lambs to be recognized as\r\nits director, and Richard Oakes as the visitor of the said Custom\r\nHouse in Montreal.\r\n\r\nThe following will interest Montreal merchants of today, being\r\nsignificant of the first loosening of restrictions upon Montreal\r\non the part of Quebec. “All ship owners and others interested in\r\ntrade are warned that all of the vessels coming from Europe or\r\nthe colonies charged on account of merchants and others, who wish\r\nto come there to do business, can follow their destinations up to\r\nthe city of Montreal without being discharged and re-charged with\r\nmerchandise at Quebec under any pretext whatever, unless they\r\nare suspected of carrying goods of contraband, in the design of\r\nmaking illicit trade.”\r\n\r\nOn the 7th of January, 1763, regulations forbidding excess speed\r\nof the carriages and horses in the streets of Montreal and\r\nsuburbs had to be laid down.\r\n\r\nOn the 4th of April Gage issued an ordinance establishing the\r\nCustom House at Montreal, with regulations to the captains\r\nof ships and officers, sailors and others to carry out the\r\nregulations issued, which show that all the paraphernalia and\r\ncustomary duty of ships reporting to the customs, avoiding\r\nsmuggling, etc., were now full of vigour. Montreal was beginning\r\nto be a port of some pretensions.\r\n\r\nAll these regulations show that the British authorities, while\r\naffirming the customs of the country and maintaining the law, as\r\nknown by the people and administered by their own men of ability\r\nand learning, the captains of the militia, of whom many were of\r\nthe noblesse, providing progressive trade regulations, required\r\nfor the development of the port and of the up-country commerce,\r\nof which the headquarters were at Montreal, were wise rulers.\r\n\r\nThe care with which the inhabitants were instructed in the\r\nknowledge of political events happening outside of their own\r\nsphere, the participation in their own judicial code by their\r\nown officers, thus beginning, as it were, to be permitted for\r\nthe first time to participate in their duty of taking part in\r\nthe government, the justice with which they were treated by the\r\nconquerors, the faithful fulfilment of dues for service received,\r\nbrought about a unity with the English soldiery and the new\r\ngovernors, that disposed the conquered people to feel little\r\nregret at the departure of the French Régime from Canada.\r\n\r\nMany there were, who were still borne up by the hope that the\r\nexpected peace would restore Canada to France, but the majority\r\nwere indifferent and if anything glad to have things remain as\r\nthey were. The position at Montreal may be summed up in the words\r\nof General Gage’s report to Amherst, dated March 20, 1762, sent\r\non to London the same year.[5]\r\n\r\n“I feel the highest satisfaction that I am able to inform you\r\nthat during my command of this government I have made it my\r\nconstant care and attention that the Canadians should be treated\r\nagreeable to His Majesty’s kind and humane intentions. No\r\ninvasion on their property or assault on their person has gone\r\nunpunished. All reproaches on their subjection by the fate of\r\narms, revilings on their customs or country and all reflections\r\non their religion, have been discountenanced and forbid. No\r\ndistinction has been made between the Briton and Canadian, but\r\nequally regarded as subjects of the same prince. The soldiers\r\nlive peaceably with the inhabitants and they reciprocally acquire\r\nan affection for each other.”\r\n\r\nThose who know the British soldier will not be surprised to hear\r\nthat in the distress that fell upon the French Canadians in 1761,\r\nmostly through the non-payment of the obligations incurred by the\r\nFrench government, for the redemption of the paper money not yet\r\nliquidated since the capitulation, the soldiers gave each one\r\na day’s provisions monthly to relieve the immediate distress.\r\nQuebec suffered most. Montreal merchants came to the rescue and\r\nswelled the general subscription lists.\r\n\r\nAs Governor Gage was on the spot, his official report may be\r\nfurther largely quoted as that of an historian of Montreal. After\r\nthe above opening remarks on the amicable relations existing\r\nbetween the French-Canadians and British, he continues: “The\r\nIndians have been treated on the same principles of humanity.\r\nThey have had immediate justice for all their wrongs and no\r\ntricks or artifices have hitherto been attempted to defraud them\r\nin their trade.”\r\n\r\nHe sends a return of the present state of the troops and\r\nartillery and a report of the fortifications. Speaking of those\r\nof Montreal he notes: “Upon a height within the city is a small\r\nsquare work of wood, completed since the capitulation, provided\r\nwith a few pieces of artillery and capable of containing seventy\r\nor eighty men.”\r\n\r\n“The soil produces all sorts of summer grains. In some parts\r\nof the government the wheat is sown in autumn. Every kind of\r\npulse and other vegetables to which I may add some fruits, viz.,\r\napples, pears, plums, melons, etc. Cider is made here, but as yet\r\nin small quantities. In general every fruit tree hardy enough to\r\nwithstand the severity of the winter will produce in the summer,\r\nwhich affords sufficient heat to bring most kinds of fruit to\r\nmaturity.”\r\n\r\nReporting as befits one stationed at the center and headquarters\r\nof the fur trade on the profits to the French king from the posts\r\nhe says, “I must conclude His Majesty gained very little from\r\nthis commerce.”\r\n\r\nHe then records what must have been of great importance to\r\nthe interests of the British merchants of Montreal desirous\r\nof up-country trade. “Immediately after we became masters of\r\nthis country all monopolies were abolished and all incumbrances\r\nupon trade were removed. The traders chose their posts without\r\nthe obligation of purchasing them and I can by no means think\r\nthe French management in giving exclusive grants of trade at\r\nparticular posts for the sake of the sale thereof or the sale\r\nof permits to trade at the free posts worthy our imitation. The\r\nIndians, of course, paid dearer for their goods and the trade in\r\ngeneral must have been injured by the monopolies.”\r\n\r\nSumming up the gain to France of Canada he says: “The only\r\nimmediate importance and advantage the French king derived from\r\nCanada was the preventing the extension of the British colonies,\r\nthe consumption of the commodities and manufactures of France\r\nand the trade of pelletry. She had no doubt views to further\r\nadvantages that the country might in time supply her with hemp,\r\ncordage, iron, masts and generally all kinds of naval stores.\r\nThe people in general seemed well enough disposed to their new\r\nmasters.\r\n\r\n“The only causes of dislike which I can discover proceed from\r\nthe fear of money, and the difference of religion. I understand\r\nCanada to be on the same footing in respect of this money as all\r\nthe French colonies and if France pays any of them I don’t see\r\nhow she can avoid paying the bills of exchange drawn from Canada\r\nin the same proportion as she pays the rest. It is the Canadians\r\nonly who would be sufferers by an exception, as Canadian bills to\r\na very large amount are in the possession of French merchants and\r\nthe rest may be sent to France and nobody be able to distinguish\r\nwhich is French and which Canadian property.”\r\n\r\nSpeaking of the second cause of dislike, the difference\r\nof religion, he says: “The people having enjoyed a free\r\nand undisturbed exercise of their religion ever since the\r\ncapitulation of their country, their fears in that particular\r\nare much abated, but there still remains a jealousy. It is to\r\nbe hoped that in time this jealousy will wear off and certainly\r\nin this, much will depend upon the clergy. Perhaps methods may\r\nbe found hereafter to supply the _curés_ of this country with\r\npriests well affected. But whilst Canada is stocked as she is\r\nnow with corps of priests detached from seminaries in France, on\r\nwhom they depend and to whom they pay obedience, it is natural to\r\nconceive that neither the priests nor those they can influence\r\nwill ever bear that love and affection to a British government\r\nwhich His Majesty’s auspicious reign would otherwise engage from\r\nthe Canadians as well as from his other subjects.”\r\n\r\nIn passing it may be noted that Gage’s fears were never realized,\r\nfor to the Canadian clergy is due the credit of having saved\r\nCanada to English rule, as will be seen afterwards. A last\r\nquotation is interesting as bearing on the question of the\r\nexodus in 1760 after the capitulation. “No persons have left\r\nthis government to go to France except those who held military\r\nand civil employment under the French king. Nor do I apprehend\r\nany emigration at the peace, being persuaded that the present\r\ninhabitants will remain under the British dominion. I perceive\r\nnone preparing to leave the government or that seem inclined to\r\ndo it unless it is a few ladies whose husbands are already in\r\nFrance, and they propose to leave the country when peace is made,\r\nif their husbands should not rather choose to return to Canada.”\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the peace was eagerly looked forward to. The\r\nproclamations of the 26th of November, given from the Palace\r\nof St. James in London, having reference to the preliminaries\r\nfor peace and the cessation of hostilities, prepared the minds\r\nof all for further intelligence. This was eventually given by\r\nThomas Gage from his Château of Montreal on the 17th of May,\r\n1763, in which the definitive treaty of peace made between their\r\nBrittannic and very Christian and Catholic majesties, signed\r\non the 6th of February, and ratified on the 10th of March, was\r\nmade known. On this occasion Gage indicated to the people the\r\nchief portions bearing upon their rights, especially that of\r\nthe exercise of their religion according to the rights of the\r\nRoman church “as far as the laws of Great Britain permit,” and\r\nsecondly that whereby the inhabitants of His Christian Majesty\r\nhad permission to leave Canada in safety and liberty, the limit\r\nfixed for this emigration being the space of eighteen months, to\r\ncount from the day of the exchange of the treaty. He communicated\r\nto the captains of his government a letter from Monseigneur de\r\nChoiseul, which had reference to the payment of debts due and\r\nrelating to the redemption of the paper money, which was still in\r\ncirculation, although the English governors sought to prohibit\r\nit. It was set forth that the Most Christian King would pay the\r\nsum due to the new subjects of Great Britain, but that the amount\r\nmust not be confounded with the money held by the French subjects.\r\n\r\nOn May 27, the governor of Montreal issued through the captains\r\nof Militia of Montreal regulations concerning the liquidation of\r\nthis paper money, directing the captains to make a declaration\r\nof the amount in their possession. They were to place the amount\r\nheld by them in the hand of Pierre Panet, _Notaire et Greffier_\r\nof Montreal, appointed for this purpose, between the first and\r\nthirtieth of June, designating the character of the notes, with\r\nthe name of the holder and other safeguards to be observed,\r\nupon which certificates of receipt would be given. Care was to\r\nbe taken that the money, which they brought, should belong to\r\nthem and that they did not lend their names to anyone. Fault\r\nin this regard would lead to prosecution for falsifying. For\r\nthis transaction a fee of five _sous_ was to be paid for every\r\nthousand _livres_ so deposited. Money was received from 7 o’clock\r\nin the morning to midday and from 2 o’clock to 5, except on\r\nSundays and holidays. This must have caused great excitement in\r\nthe city. Great care was taken to instruct the habitants of the\r\nvalue of their money and warn them against becoming the victims\r\nof speculators.[6]\r\n\r\nMeanwhile preparations were being made for the removal of General\r\nGage from the post, which he had filled with excellent judgment\r\nand with habitual prudence.\r\n\r\nOn August 5th, Gage issued some further ordinances regulating the\r\ntransport of merchandise and ammunition to the savages, seeing\r\nthat these latter had again been making incursions into the\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nOn August 18 he upheld a complaint of the established merchants\r\nagainst the peddlers who were underselling the merchants in the\r\nstreets, forbidding anyone to sell in the public places of the\r\ncity, the streets and even the squares, river banks and suburbs.\r\n\r\nOn the 16th of September he issued an ordinance concerning\r\ncertain uncultivated lands in the districts of the Government,\r\nwhich had been granted with titles of concessions “en fief” under\r\nthe former régime, and on which there had been no ground broken\r\nas yet, on account of wars or other events. Those having these\r\nshould present their credentials or applications at once, so\r\nas to have them recognized, to avoid any conflict with future\r\nconcessions.\r\n\r\nGeneral Gage left Montreal with the esteem of all. He was\r\npresented with an affectionate address by the captains of the\r\n_Chambre de Milice_, over which he had presided as the Chief\r\nJudge, and he replied to them by a letter on October 15, 1763,\r\nbegging them to accept his testimony in recognition of the\r\nservices which they had rendered to the king of the country,\r\ntrusting that they would continue the same for the public good\r\nand that their service, for which they had already required\r\nso great a reputation among their own compatriots, would not\r\nfail to draw upon them the good-will and protection of the\r\nking. Certainly Gage might safely boast, as he had done in his\r\nletter to Amherst, of the peaceful state of Montreal under his\r\ngovernment. He had helped to forge the links of intimacy that\r\nbound the _noblesse_ and the British officials, the militia and\r\nthe military officers, which made for the harmonious transition\r\nbetween the old and the new régimes. Whether or not the alliance\r\nwas an unmixed blessing is shown by subsequent events.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[1] Before leaving, General Amherst appointed military governors\r\nfor three districts. Their tenures of office were as follows:\r\nDistrict of Montreal, General Thomas Gage, September, 1760, to\r\nOctober, 1763; Colonel Ralph Burton, October, 1763, to August,\r\n1764. District of Quebec, General James Murray, September, 1760,\r\nto August, 1764. District of Three Rivers, Colonel Ralph Burton,\r\nSeptember, 1760, to May, 1762; Colonel F. Haldimand, May, 1762,\r\nto March, 1763; Colonel Ralph Burton, March, 1763, to October,\r\n1763; Colonel F. Haldimand, October, 1763, to August, 1764.\r\n\r\n[2] The French runs: “_Et nous a laissé un gage precieux_, etc.”\r\nThe word “pledge” instead of “gage” in the English translation\r\ndestroys the delicate _double entendre_ and compliment, evidently\r\nmeant in the French version.\r\n\r\n[3] The first mayor of Montreal.\r\n\r\n[4] For the above abstracts of the ordinance of October 13th and\r\nOctober 17th see “The Canadian Militia,” by Captain Ernest J.\r\nChambers, 1907.\r\n\r\n[5] This was prepared for Pitt according to the order of Lord\r\nEgremont in his dispatch to Sir Jeffrey Amherst of December\r\n12, 1761, in which the king approves of the system of military\r\ngovernment established in the districts of Quebec, Three Rivers\r\nand Montreal. He instructs Amherst to send for His Majesty’s\r\ninformation a full account of the newly acquired country. In\r\nresponse to this command communicated to Murray, Burton and Gage,\r\nreports from the latter were prepared and forwarded to Amherst.\r\nThese reports were among the documents submitted to the Board of\r\nTrade for their information in preparing a plan of government for\r\nthe territories ceded to Britain by the treaty of Paris of 1763.\r\n\r\n[6] The same arrangements were carried out at Quebec and Three\r\nRivers and Murray reported that the total amount of the paper\r\nmoney in circulation was nearly 17,000,000 of _livres_, that, in\r\nthe government of Montreal alone, being 7,980,298-8-4. Kingsford,\r\nHistory of Canada, Vol. V, page 181, remarks: “An attempt to\r\ndepreciate the value of this paper was made by the court of\r\nFrance in which it was pointed out that from the discredit to\r\nwhich it had fallen it had been purchased at 80 to 90 per cent\r\ndiscount; that it did not represent the value of what had been\r\nreceived, owing to the high price paid for the articles obtained;\r\nthat the bills of exchange of 1759 were paid in part and that\r\nbills that remained were only such as had been issued after this\r\npayment. The British reply was that the court of France, having\r\nbeen the cause of the discredit alleged had no right to profit by\r\nit, that the prices paid for supplies had been established by the\r\nintendant, that the date of the ordinances could not constitute a\r\nreason why they should not be paid, that such paper money was the\r\ncurrency of the colony issued by France, consequently the country\r\nwas responsible for it.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                           CHAPTER III\r\n\r\n                 THE DEFINITIVE TREATY OF PARIS\r\n\r\n                              1763\r\n\r\n                    THE NEW CIVIL GOVERNMENT\r\n\r\n  THE DEFINITIVE TREATY OF PEACE--SECTION RELATING TO\r\n    CANADA--CATHOLIC DISABILITIES AND THE PHRASE “AS FAR AS THE\r\n    LAWS OF GREAT BRITAIN PERMIT”--THE TREATY RECEIVED WITH DELIGHT\r\n    BY THE “OLD” SUBJECTS BUT WITH DISAPPOINTMENT BY THE “NEW”--THE\r\n    INEVITABLE STRUGGLES BEGIN, TO CULMINATE IN THE QUEBEC ACT\r\n    OF 1774--OPPOSITION AT MONTREAL, THE HEADQUARTERS OF THE\r\n    SEIGNEURS--THE NEW CIVIL GOVERNMENT IN ACTION--CIVIL COURTS AND\r\n    JUSTICES OF THE PEACE ESTABLISHED--MURRAY’S ACTION IN ALLOWING\r\n    “ALL SUBJECTS OF THE COLONY” TO BE CALLED UPON TO ACT AS JURORS\r\n    VIOLENTLY OPPOSED BY THE BRITISH PARTY AS UNCONSTITUTIONAL--THE\r\n    PROTEST OF THE QUEBEC GRAND JURY--SUBSEQUENT MODIFICATIONS\r\n    IN 1766 TO SUIT ALL PARTIES--GOVERNOR MURRAY’S COMMENT\r\n    ON MONTREAL, “EVERY INTRIGUE TO OUR DISADVANTAGE WILL BE\r\n    HATCHED THERE”--MURRAY AND THE MONTREAL MERCHANTS--A TIME OF\r\n    MISUNDERSTANDING. NOTE: LIST OF SUBSEQUENT GOVERNORS.\r\n\r\n\r\nBefore proceeding further it will be well to set before the\r\nreader some special portions of “_The definitive treaty of peace\r\nand friendship between His Britannic Majesty, the Most Christian\r\nKing, and the king of Spain, concluded at Paris the 10th day of\r\nFebruary, 1763, to which the king of Portugal acceded on the same\r\nday_.”\r\n\r\nSection IV relating to Canada was as follows:\r\n\r\n  “His Most Christian Majesty renounces all pretensions which he\r\n  has heretofore formed or might have formed to Nova Scotia or\r\n  Acadia in all its parts, and guarantees the whole of it and with\r\n  all its dependencies to the King of Great Britain. Moreover\r\n  his most Christian Majesty accedes and guarantees to his said\r\n  Britannic Majesty in full right, Canada with all its dependencies\r\n  as well as the island of Cape Breton and all the other islands\r\n  and coasts in the Gulph and river of St. Lawrence and in general\r\n  everything that depends on the said countries, lands, islands\r\n  and coasts with the sovereignty, property, possessions and all\r\n  rights acquired by treaty or otherwise, which the Most Christian\r\n  King and the crown of France have had till now over the said\r\n  countries, lands, islands, places, coasts and their inhabitants,\r\n  so that the Most Christian King cedes and makes over the whole to\r\n  the said King and to the Crown of Great Britain and that in the\r\n  most ample manner and form, without restriction and without any\r\n  liberty to depart from the said cession and guarantee under any\r\n  pretense, or to disturb Great Britain in the possessions above\r\n  mentioned.\r\n\r\n  “His Britannic Majesty on his side agrees to grant the liberty of\r\n  the Catholick religion to the inhabitants of Canada; he will in\r\n  consequence give the most precise and most effectual orders that\r\n  his new Roman Catholick subjects may profess the worship of their\r\n  religion according to the rights of the Romish church as far as\r\n  the laws of Great Britain permit. His Britannic Majesty further\r\n  agrees that the French inhabitants or others who have been\r\n  subjects of the Most Christian King in Canada may retire with all\r\n  safety and freedom whenever they shall think proper and may sell\r\n  their estates provided it be to the subjects of His Britannic\r\n  Majesty, and bring away their effects as well as their persons\r\n  without being restrained in their emigration under any pretense\r\n  whatever except that of debts or of criminal prosecutions; the\r\n  term limited for this emigration shall be fixed to the space of\r\n  eighteen months to be computed from the day of the exchange of\r\n  the ratification of the present treaty.”\r\n\r\nThe definitive treaty of Paris of February 10, 1763, proclaimed\r\nby Governor Gage in Montreal on May 17th, was received with\r\ndelight by the English merchants, for they looked forward eagerly\r\nfor the civil government to be set up in which they, but a\r\nhandful, hoped by the right of conquest to assume the high hand.\r\nThey had long chafed under what they, more than the “Canadians,”\r\nchose to call military despotism. They had looked upon the\r\namicable temporary participation of the Canadians in their own\r\ngovernment, with eyes of envy. They were of the same metal as\r\nthe British merchants of Quebec who, relying on their undoubted\r\nenergy in developing the commercial interests of the country, and\r\nin their self-satisfaction, so aggrandized their own importance\r\nthat they wished to rule solely, so that they early petitioned\r\nhis Majesty for a representative assembly in this province as in\r\nall the other provinces of His Majesty. “There are,” they said,\r\n“a sufficient number of loyal and interested Protestants outside\r\nthe military officers to form a legislative assembly, and the new\r\nsubjects of His Majesty, if he should believe it proper, could\r\nbe authorized to elect Protestants without having to take oath\r\nagainst their conscience.” (See constitutional documents, Doughty\r\n& Shortt.)\r\n\r\nThere were only about two hundred Protestants, and these not all\r\neducated or upright men, in the whole country at this time--in\r\nQuebec 144, in Montreal 56. Yet they desired to represent the\r\nwhole people and to exclude the “new subjects” from every\r\nposition of trust under the new civil government. At the time of\r\nMurray’s recall in 1766 they had reached the number of 450.\r\n\r\nThe Canadians were not prepared for the new turn of the tide. In\r\nconsequence we shall see that between 1763 and 1774 the country\r\nwas in an unsettled state, owing to the conflict inevitable\r\nbetween the two forces of the old and new régimes striving for\r\nrecognition.\r\n\r\nUnder the military law the “new subjects” had been entrusted with\r\na share in the government. The English rulers were officers and\r\ngentlemen who respected the claims of the Seigneurs as well as\r\nof the simple habitants, and moreover their religion was held in\r\nhonour. They had been led to believe that this happy state would\r\ncontinue. Gage and Murray in their report to Egremont seem to\r\nhint how they were hoodwinked. “Canadians are very ignorant and\r\nextremely tenacious of their religion. Nothing can contribute to\r\nmake them staunch subjects to His Majesty as the new government\r\ngiving them every reason to imagine no alteration is to be\r\nattempted in that point.”\r\n\r\nThus when the “new subjects” came to understand that they were\r\nonly to “profess the worship of their religion according to the\r\nrights of the Romish church _as far as the laws of Great Britain\r\npermit_,” and that that permission was to be interpreted along\r\nthe lines of the Catholic civil disabilities in England, they\r\nfelt that they were proscribed men who had been ensnared by\r\nroseate promises of a wise interpretation of British liberty to\r\nbe extended to them as new subjects.\r\n\r\nThe situation was impossible and at once there began the\r\ninevitable struggle and the long series of accommodations that\r\nwere eventually to culminate in the Quebec act of 1774, the Magna\r\nCharta of French Canadians. The significance of this act cannot\r\nbe understood unless the religious proscription in the policy of\r\nthe new government be understood. Hence the opposition among the\r\nSeigneurs in Montreal, their headquarters, was secretly fostered,\r\nwhich later alarmed Carleton so much, as we shall see. The French\r\nCanadian clergy and Seigneurs of Montreal looked upon the new\r\nchange of government as an attempt to Anglicize their religion\r\nas well as their laws. And they were not far wrong. In a letter\r\nto Governor Murray, the secretary of state, Lord Egremont, wrote\r\nfrom Whitehall on August 13, 1763, acquainting him that the King\r\nhad been graciously pleased to confer on him the civil government\r\nof Canada and making special reference to the qualification,\r\n“as far as the laws of Great Britain permit,” which laws, he\r\nexplains, prohibit absolutely all Popish hierarchy in any of\r\nthe dominions belonging to the Crown of Great Britain and can\r\nonly admit of a toleration of the exercise of that religion; this\r\nmatter was clearly understood in the negotiation of the exercise\r\nof that religion; the French ministers proposed to insert the\r\nwords _comme ci-devant_ in order that the Romish religion should\r\ncontinue to be exercised in the same manner as under their\r\ngovernment; and they did not give up their point until they were\r\nplainly told that it would be deceiving them to admit those\r\nwords, for the king had not the power to tolerate that religion\r\nin any other manner than as far as the laws of Great Britain\r\npermit. “These laws must be your guide in any disputes that may\r\narise on this subject.”\r\n\r\nThe intention was precisely to tolerate for a time the Romish\r\nreligion and gradually to supplant it. The royal instructions to\r\nGovernor Murray, given from the court of St. James by King George\r\non the 7th day of December, 1763, leave no doubt on this head.\r\nThe intention to suppress the natural growth of the Catholic\r\nchurch in Canada by crippling it forever at its fountain head by\r\ngiving no guarantee of the recognition of the Episcopal power and\r\njurisdiction, had already been foreshadowed in the two clauses\r\nsubmitted by Vaudreuil in the terms of the capitulation of\r\nMontreal.\r\n\r\n  Article XXX: “If by the treaty of peace Canada shall remain in\r\n  the power of His Britannic Majesty, His Most Christian Majesty\r\n  shall continue to name the bishop of the colony, who shall always\r\n  be of the Roman communion and under whose authority the people\r\n  shall exercise the Roman religion: ‘Refused.’”\r\n\r\n  Article XXXI: “The bishop shall, in case of need, establish new\r\n  parishes and provide for the building of his cathedral and his\r\n  Episcopal palace; and in the meantime he shall have the liberty\r\n  to dwell in towns or parishes as he shall judge proper. He shall\r\n  be at liberty to visit his diocese with the ordinary ceremonies\r\n  and exercise also the jurisdiction which his predecessor\r\n  exercised under the French dominion, save that an oath of\r\n  fidelity or a promise to do nothing contrary to His Britannic\r\n  Majesty’s service, may be required of him: ‘This article is\r\n  comprised under the foregoing.’”\r\n\r\nThe reason for this was signalized in the instructions later to\r\nMurray, Carleton and Haldimand in the clause beginning:\r\n\r\n  “And to the end that the ecclesiastical jurisdiction of the\r\n  lord bishop of London may take place in our province under your\r\n  government as conveniently as possible,” etc.\r\n\r\n  Section XXXII reads: “You are not to admit of any ecclesiastical\r\n  jurisdiction of the See of Rome or of any other foreign\r\n  jurisdiction whatsoever in the province under your government.”\r\n\r\n  Section XXXIII: “And to the end that the Church of England may\r\n  be established both in principle and practice and that the said\r\n  inhabitants may by degrees be induced to embrace the Protestant\r\n  religion and their children be brought up in the principles of\r\n  it, we do hereby declare it to be our intention when the said\r\n  province shall have been accurately surveyed and divided into\r\n  townships, districts, precincts or parishes in such manner as\r\n  shall be hereinafter directed, all possible encouragement shall\r\n  be given to the erecting of Protestant schools in the same\r\n  districts, townships and precincts by settling, appointing and\r\n  allotting proper quantities of land for that purpose and also for\r\n  a glebe and maintenance for a Protestant minister and Protestant\r\n  schoolmaster, and you are to consider and report to us by our\r\n  Commissions for Trade and Plantation by what other means the\r\n  Protestant religion may be promoted, established and encouraged\r\n  in our province under your government.”\r\n\r\nThis instruction to Murray is repeated in those to Governor\r\nCarleton, 1768, and to Governor Haldimand, 1778.\r\n\r\nLet us see how the civil government worked out. It was proclaimed\r\non April 10, 1764, the delay being caused to allow the French\r\nCanadians the eighteen months, stipulated by the treaty of Paris,\r\nin which they might leave the country. Murray had been appointed\r\ngovernor-general of the province of Quebec by the commission of\r\nNovember 21, 1763, and the instructions were dated on December\r\n7th. But Murray had not promulgated the new dignity accorded him\r\ntill on September 17th, 1764, the first great act of the new\r\nrégime being opened by his ordinance establishing civil courts.\r\nIt may be briefly stated as follows: there was to be a Superior\r\nCourt of judicature or King’s Bench, which should be held at\r\nQuebec twice a year at the Hilary term commencing on January 1st\r\nand at Trinity term on June 21st. Its president should be the\r\nchief justice of Canada. This was William Gregory. This man,\r\nwith the attorney-general, Suckling, were soon removed for\r\nincompetency. Later in 1766 a Michaelmas term was added. Montreal\r\nand Three Rivers were to have the chief justices’ court of\r\nassizes and jail delivery after Hilary once a year.\r\n\r\nStrangely enough, though not unnaturally, Murray had inserted\r\na clause in the act which was afterwards violently objected to\r\nby the English merchants as going beyond his commission, viz.,\r\nthat _all the subjects of the colony_ could be called upon\r\nwithout distinction to take their place on the jury. Murray had\r\nto explain this to the English government and accordingly with\r\nthe copy of the above act sent, he remarked to the following\r\neffect: “As there are only two hundred Protestant subjects in\r\nthe province, the greater part of which is composed of disbanded\r\nsoldiers of small fortunes and of little capacity, it is\r\nconsidered unjust to prevent the Roman Catholic new subjects from\r\ntaking part on juries, for such an exclusion would constitute\r\nthe said two hundred Protestants perpetual judges of the lives\r\nand fortunes not only of the eighty thousand new subjects but of\r\nall the military in this province. Moreover, if the Canadians\r\nare not admitted to juries many will emigrate.” Murray felt that\r\nhis position might not carry, for he adds: “This arrangement is\r\nnothing else than a temporary expedient to leave affairs in their\r\npresent state until the pleasure of His Majesty on this critical\r\nand difficult point be made known.”\r\n\r\nBesides the superior court there should be an inferior court of\r\n“Common Pleas” to settle civil cases involving sums of beyond\r\nten _louis_. Beyond twenty _louis_ there was appeal allowed to\r\nthe superior court. If desired there could be juries called in\r\nthis court. French advocates and proctors could practice in this\r\ncourt, though not in the superior court. Murray explains the\r\nliberty taken by him in allowing this: “Because we have not as\r\nyet a single English advocate or proctor understanding the French\r\nlanguage.” He also observed that the court of common pleas was\r\nestablished solely for the protection of the French Canadian.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the other two courts, Justices of the Peace were\r\nestablished at Quebec and Montreal who should hold quarter\r\nsessions. These officers of the magistracy, according to Murray’s\r\ninstructions, had to be Protestants. One justice was to have\r\njurisdiction in disputes to the value of five pounds; two were\r\nrequired for cases to the value of ten pounds. Three justices\r\nshould form a quorum to hold quarter sessions, to adjudicate in\r\ncases from ten pounds to thirty pounds. Two justices were to sit\r\nweekly in rotation in Quebec and Montreal.\r\n\r\nFinally there should be elected in every parish in the country\r\nbailiffs and sub-bailiffs. The elections were to take place\r\nevery 21st day of June and they were to enter upon their duties\r\non September 29th. “We call them bailiffs,” commenced Murray,\r\n“because the new subjects understand the word better than that of\r\nconstables.” The word constable, will, however, better explain\r\nthe nature of their multifarious duties.\r\n\r\nWe now have a view of the change in the law courts in Montreal:\r\na yearly session of the king’s court and of the court of common\r\npleas, quarter sessions held by the justices of the peace, and in\r\nthe parishes, the bailiffs or constables.\r\n\r\nHardly had the courts erected by the act of September 7th\r\nbeen held, than the grand jury of Quebec protested vehemently\r\nat the new courts and especially at the privileges given the\r\nnew subjects. Their opposition was expected by Murray for his\r\ncomment, sent with the act, ran: that some of the English\r\nmerchants residing here of whom only ten or a dozen at most\r\npossess any settled property in this province, are very\r\ndissatisfied at the privileges granted to the Canadians to act on\r\njuries; the reason of this is very evident as their influence is\r\nrestrained by the measure.\r\n\r\nBritishers on the jury who thought the favours to Catholics\r\nunconstitutional were only victims of their narrow prejudices\r\nformed by the prevailing intolerance then existing in England and\r\nits colonies. The toleration to Catholics according to the phrase\r\n“as far as the laws of Great Britain allow” was not the wide\r\nfreedom we see nowadays.\r\n\r\nA protest against allowing the latter class to practice in the\r\ncourts or to serve on juries was made early by the Protestant\r\nmembers of the grand jury of Quebec on October 16, 1764, as\r\nfollows: “That by the definitive treaty the Roman religion was\r\nonly tolerated in the province of Quebec as far as the laws of\r\nGreat Britain had met. It was and is enacted by the third act,\r\nJanuary 1st, chapter V, section 8, ‘No Papist or Popish recusant\r\nconvict shall practice the common law as a counsellor, clerk,\r\nattorney or solicitor, nor shall practice the civic law as\r\nadvocate or proctor, nor practice physick, nor be an apothecary,\r\nnor shall be a judge, minister, clerk or steward of or in any\r\ncourt, nor shall bear any office or charge as captain, master,\r\nor governor, or bear any office of charge of, or, in any ship,\r\ncastle or fortress, but be utterly disabled for the same, and\r\nevery person herein shall forfeit one hundred pounds, half to\r\nthe king and half to them that shall sue.’ We therefore believe\r\nthat the admitting of persons of Romish religion, who own the\r\nauthority, supremacy and jurisdiction of the church of Rome,\r\nas jurors is an open violation of our most sacred laws and\r\nliberties, tending to the utter subversion of the Protestant\r\nreligion and His Majesty’s power, authority, right and possession\r\nof the province to which we belong.” Later these jurors pretended\r\nthat they had never meant to exclude Catholic jurors, but only\r\nas jurors when Protestants were contestants. The above argument\r\nshows their original _intrinsigeance_.\r\n\r\nLater, in February, 1766, modifications were introduced; when\r\nthe contestants were British the jury should be British; when\r\nCanadians, Canadians; when the contestants were mixed the\r\njury should also be mixed. These conflicts were inevitable\r\nin unsettled times when two peoples were of different mental\r\noutlooks, politically, racially and religiously. The melting pot\r\nof time will solve such difficulties, when the viewpoints of both\r\nparties would be more sympathetically understood. In the meantime\r\nthe historical situation at the time was painful.\r\n\r\nGovernor Murray’s letter to the Lords of Trade, written a\r\nfew days after the presentment of the jury is a fair and\r\nstatesman-like view of the difficult period.\r\n\r\n                           “Quebec, 29th of October, 1764.\r\n\r\n“* * * Little, very little, will content the new subjects, but\r\nnothing will satisfy the licentious fanaticks trading here, but\r\nthe expulsion of the Canadians who are perhaps the bravest and\r\nbest race upon the globe, a race who, could they be indulged\r\nwith a few privileges which the laws of England deny to Roman\r\nCatholics at home, would soon get the better of every national\r\nantipathy to their conquerors and become the most faithful and\r\nmost useful set of men in this American empire.\r\n\r\n“I flatter myself there will be some remedy found out even in\r\nthe laws for the relief of this people. If so, I am positive the\r\npopular clamours in England will not prevent the humane heart\r\nof the king from following its own dictates. I am confident,\r\ntoo, my royal master will not blame the unanimous opinion of\r\nhis council here for the ordinance establishing the courts of\r\njustice, as nothing less could be done to prevent great numbers\r\nfrom emigrating directly and certain I am, unless the Canadians\r\nare admitted on juries and are allowed judges and lawyers who\r\nunderstand their language, His Majesty will lose the greatest\r\npart of this valuable people.”\r\n\r\nHis letter immediately continues with the following allusion\r\nwhich helps us to place the position of Montreal in the above\r\ngeneral constitutional crisis then affecting the colony. “I beg\r\nleave further,” says Murray, “to represent to your Lordship that\r\na lieutenant governor at Montreal is absolutely necessary. That\r\ntown is in the heart of the most populous part of the provinces.\r\nIt is surrounded by the Indian nations and is 180 miles from\r\nthe capital. It is there that the most opulent priests live and\r\nthere are settled the greatest part of the French noblesse.\r\nConsequently every intrigue to our disadvantage will be hatched\r\nthere.”\r\n\r\nA postscript to this letter to the Lords of Trade and\r\nPlantations, gives Murray’s appreciation of some of the great\r\ncommercial class: “P.S.--I have been informed that Messrs.\r\nWilliam McKenzie, Alexander McKenzie and William Grant have been\r\nsoliciting their friends in London to prevail upon Your Lordship\r\nto get them admitted into his Majesty’s council of this province.\r\nI think it my duty to acquaint Your Lordships that the first of\r\nthese men is a notorious smuggler and a turbulent man, the second\r\na weak man of little character and the third a conceited boy. In\r\nshort it will be impossible to do business with any of them.”\r\n\r\nThis postscript indicates the strain and bitter personal\r\nrelations between Murray and some of the British commercial\r\nelement in the colony, who finally succeeded in obtaining his\r\nrecall.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, Murray was not always as discreet or as just in\r\nthe consideration of his opponents, as his position justified.\r\nHe was a soldier rather than a peace maker. In addition, others\r\nbesides the British merchant did not see eye to eye with him\r\nin the interpretation of the new Treaty of Paris or in the\r\napplication of English laws in Canada.\r\n\r\nThey retorted as did the Quebec traders, that the governor “doth\r\nfrequently treat them with a rage and rudeness of language and\r\ndemeanour as dishonourable to the trust he holds of Your Majesty\r\nas painful to those who suffer from it.”\r\n\r\nIn commenting on this period, Prof. F.P. Walton, dean of the\r\nfaculty of Law at McGill University, has the following criticism\r\n(Cf. University Magazine, April, 1908):\r\n\r\nHe is speaking of the charge against Murray’s interpretation of\r\nthe new situation of the application of the new civil government.\r\n\r\n“It is probable,” he says, “that at no period in the history of\r\nCanada were legal questions so much discussed among the mass of\r\nthe population as in the first ten years of the English _régime_.\r\nThis is not surprising when we consider that the question whether\r\nthe English or the French law was in force in the Province\r\nwas one of no little difficulty. It was contended with much\r\nplausibility that Murray’s Ordinances were of no legal validity\r\nbecause, under the King’s proclamation, legislative authority\r\nin the Province was to be exercised only by the governor with\r\nthe consent of a council and assembly, and that no assembly had\r\never been summoned. This is not the place for a discussion of\r\nthis subject. I prefer the view of those who maintain that the\r\nEnglish law was introduced by the proclamation of 1763. The case\r\nof Campbell and Hall is sufficient authority for the proposition,\r\nthat the King had the power without parliament to alter the law\r\nof Quebec. It seems to me that the natural construction of the\r\nproclamation itself is, that the King intended to introduce\r\nthe English law there and then. Murray, as Masères says in his\r\nvery convincing argument, ‘meant only to erect and constitute\r\ncourts of judicature to administer a system of laws already in\r\nbeing, to wit, the laws of England.’ The whole affair was to a\r\ngreat extent a misunderstanding. The English government had no\r\nintention to force the English laws on an unwilling people. They\r\nunderstood that they were giving ‘Home Rule’ to the Province of\r\nQuebec, and expected that the Canadians would abrogate such parts\r\nof the English law as they did not consider suitable, and would\r\nre-enact the portions of the old French law which they desired to\r\nretain. They did not foresee that, owing to the impracticability\r\nof calling an assembly, the Province would be left without any\r\nauthority competent to legislate.”\r\n\r\nIt was, indeed, a time of great misunderstanding.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              NOTE\r\n\r\n                  GOVERNORS UNDER BRITISH RULE\r\n\r\nAs it may be convenient henceforth to omit mention of the advent\r\nof successive governors, this list is appended for the purpose of\r\nreference.\r\n\r\n  * (Gen.

His ordinances have nothing striking\r\nbeyond one ordering all who had gunpowder in their homes, and\r\nthere were many, to take it to the powder magazine, and another\r\nannouncing that on April 24, 1764, all who in accordance with\r\nthe definitive treaty of peace wished to leave for France must\r\nwithin three weeks send in their declarations with their exact\r\ndescriptions and the number of their household they propose to\r\ntake with them. In August, Murray reported that only 270 men,\r\nwomen and children, mostly officers and their families, left the\r\ncolony.\r\n\r\nOn August 10th military rule ended in Montreal but Burton\r\ncontinued on as military commandant.\r\n\r\nBurton resigned his governorship in July, 1764. As the position\r\nof governor was not to be continued at Montreal or Quebec, no\r\none succeeded him. He was confirmed, however, as Brigadier. Yet,\r\nalthough in command of a few troops, he refused to recognize\r\nMurray as his military superior, hence complications and\r\nconflicts arose. Murray wrote in indignation that if Burton were\r\nremoved it would be better for himself and everybody. Murray is\r\naccused by his enemies of quarreling with everybody, but it is\r\nevidently hard on a governor general to have his wings clipped\r\nby having under him in a civil capacity a commander who took his\r\norders from General Gage of New York. Where the military rights\r\nand civil duties of Burton at Montreal or of Haldimand at Three\r\nRivers and Murray at Quebec, began and ended, was a harassing\r\ndoubt to all three.\r\n\r\nOn January 11, 1764, letters patent were sent to the first\r\njustices of the peace at Montreal, including Moses Hazen, J.\r\nGrant, John Rowe, Francis McKay, Thomas Lambe, F. Knife, John\r\nBurke, Thomas Walker and others. Among these were two Swiss\r\nProtestants, Catholics being excluded from the office as yet,\r\nowing to the difficulty of their subscribing to the religious\r\ntest not being yet solved.\r\n\r\nThe first general quarter sessions of the peace was held on\r\nDecember 27, 1764, and there were present Moses Hazen, J. Dumas,\r\nF. McKay, Thomas Lambe and Francis Knife. The court adjourned.\r\nThe first case was one of battery and assault.\r\n\r\nOn August 10, 1764, military rule ceased. The new civil\r\ngovernment brought to a head much of the ill feeling existing\r\nin the city. The tables were now turned, the merchant class,\r\nalready become the magistrates, were now in the ascendant and\r\nrancours prevailed. The old-time antipathies between the soldiers\r\nand citizens at New York and Boston were being reproduced in\r\nMontreal. There were no barracks, although the troops had been\r\nthere four years. Consequently the system of billeting became\r\nnecessary and caused continual annoyance.\r\n\r\nThe famous Walker outrage grew out of one of these troubles.\r\nCaptain Fraser had billeted a Captain Payne on a French-Canadian.\r\nIn the house lodged one of the new justices of the peace who\r\nclaimed exemption for the house. In reply he was told that\r\nthe justices’ rooms were exempt but not the other rooms, and\r\non Payne’s persistence in claiming the billet, the magistrate\r\nrefused to yield his possession. The case was brought before\r\nJustice Walker, who, as a magistrate, ordered Payne to vacate the\r\nrooms and on his refusing to comply committed him to jail for\r\ncontempt. He was released on bail. Two days afterwards, on the\r\n6th of December, 1764, occurred the “Walker outrage,” which has\r\nbeen described more or less fully in various histories of Canada,\r\nsometimes incorrectly.\r\n\r\nWalker was an Englishman who had lived for many years in Boston,\r\ncoming to Montreal some time after the close of the war in 1760,\r\nwhere he engaged in trade with the upper country. He was a bold,\r\naggressive man, full of democratic notions, who set himself up as\r\nthe agent of the people, opposed the actions of Governor Murray\r\nin every way, and afterwards had endeavoured to use his influence\r\nto have Murray recalled. In many ways he showed that he was no\r\ngreat friend of the Military then established in Montreal.\r\n\r\nThe outrage on him, dated on the night of the 6th, he attributed\r\nto the Military, and was the occasion of the seizure of “John\r\nFraser, Esq.,” Deputy Grand Paymaster; “John Campbell, Esq.,” now\r\nCaptain of His Majesty’s Twenty-seventh Regiment; “Daniel Disney,\r\nEsq.,” now Captain of the Twenty-fourth Regiment; “St. Luke La\r\nCorne, Esq.,” (Knight St. Louis), “Samuel Evans,” Lieutenants\r\nin His Majesty’s Twenty-eighth Regiment, and “Joseph Howard,”\r\nMerchant, all of the City of Montreal, being to their great\r\nsurprise seized and taken out of their beds in the middle of\r\nthe night of the 18th inst., November, 1766, by “Edward William\r\nGray, Esq.,” Deputy Provost Martial in and for the district of\r\nMontreal, assisted by a party of soldiers with fixed bayonets,\r\nand by them hurried down to Quebec, where they were in close\r\ncustody on the charge of having on or about “the sixth day of\r\nDecember, 1764, feloniously and with malice forethought, and by\r\nlying in wait assaulted, wounded and cut off part of the ear\r\nof ‘Thomas Walker, Esq.,’ of Montreal in this Province, with\r\nintention in so doing to disfigure the said ‘Thomas Walker.’”\r\nThe informant was “George Magovock” late soldier in the\r\nTwenty-eighth Regiment of foot, making oath before “William Hey,”\r\nChief Justice in and for the Province of Quebec.\r\n\r\nThe Chief Justice was petitioned by the prisoners to be released\r\non bail, but apparently the influence of Walker was so great,\r\nthat this was not easy. The whole of Montreal was in a great\r\nstate of irritable excitement, a deputation of the members of the\r\nCouncil, the principal merchants of Montreal and the officers of\r\nthe Fifteenth, Twenty-seventh, Fifty-second and Royal American\r\nRegiments entreated the Chief Justice to grant the petition of\r\nthe prisoners for bail, asking him to interpose his authority and\r\nto mitigate the rigour of the law for gentlemen, “whose honors we\r\nare so well convinced, that we offer to become their bail until\r\nthe trial.”\r\n\r\nThe petition is signed by the following: Colonel Irving,\r\nA. Mabane,[1] Thomas Dunn,[1] J. Goldfrap, F. Mounier, T.\r\nMills, Members of the Council; Thomas Ainslie, Collector of\r\nthe Customs and Justice of the Peace; J. Marteilhe, J.P.; J.\r\nCollins, J.P.; C. Drummond, Comp. of the Customs; J. Porteus,\r\nCharles Grant, S. Frazer, J. Woolsey, W. Grant, G. Measam, T.\r\nScott, J. Werden, E. Gray, J. Aitken, Wm. Garett, G. Allsopp,\r\nJ. Antill, Gridley, H. Boone, J. Watmough, Samuel Jacobs, H.\r\nTaylor, F. Grant, S. Lymbery, Amiet, Perras, Dusault, Deplaine,\r\nFleurimont, Fremont, Perrault, Bousseau, Guillemain, Panet,\r\nBeaubien, Principal Merchants; La Naudiere, Crois de St.\r\nLouis; Captain Grove, Royal Artillery; Colonel Irving, Captain\r\nPrescott, Captain-Lieutenant D’Aripe, Lieutenants Mitchel,\r\nLockart, Dunn, Magra, Doctor Roberts, Fifteenth Regiment; Captain\r\nMorris, Ensign Winter, Twenty-seventh Regiment; Colonel Jones,\r\nCaptains Phillips, Williams, Addison, Davidson, Alcock, Geofrey,\r\nLieutenants Neilson, Dinsdale, Smyth, Aderly, Hamilton, Watters,\r\nHolland, Hawksley, Adjutant Splain, Ensigns Stubbs, Molesworth,\r\nFifty-second Regiment; Captains Carden, Etherington, Schloser,\r\nTucker, Burin, Rechat, Ensign McKulloch, Royal Americans.\r\n\r\nWhatever the whole hubbub was about it was evidently of such\r\nimportance that the Chief Justice did not see his way to grant\r\nthe bail, and it was not until two years later that the case came\r\nbefore the Grand Jury in Montreal. Meanwhile the city had been\r\ndivided in two factions.\r\n\r\nOn the 28th of February, the cases against all but Captain\r\nDisney were thrown out by the Grand Jury,[2] but a true bill was\r\nbrought against him. This was on a Monday. Francis Masères, who\r\nsucceeded Suckling as attorney general, prosecuted for the Crown,\r\nand Morison, Gregory and Antill defended Town Major Disney.\r\n\r\nWe may now tell the story in the words of the report of Chief\r\nJustice Hey, transmitted to London on his return to Quebec on\r\nApril 14, 1767.\r\n\r\n  “_The bill against Major Disney being returned on a Monday,\r\n  I appointed Wednesday for his trial, his Jury, after some\r\n  few challenges on both sides, was composed of very reputable\r\n  English merchants residing at Montreal, of very fair characters\r\n  & as unprejudiced as men could be who had heard so much of so\r\n  interesting a story._\r\n\r\n  “_The only evidence that affected Major Disney was that of Mr. &\r\n  Mrs. Walker & Magovock, the substance of which I will take the\r\n  liberty to state to yr. Lordship as shortly & as truly as my\r\n  notes & my memory will enable me to do, all the other witnesses\r\n  speaking to the fact as committed by somebody without any\r\n  particular knowledge of Major Disney._\r\n\r\n  “_The narrative will perhaps be less perplexed--The house opens\r\n  with two doors, one a strong one next the street, (within that a\r\n  sashed one), into the hall where the Family were at supper when\r\n  the affair began; short on the right hand at the entrance from\r\n  the street are folding doors which lead into a Parlour, at the\r\n  further end of which Fronting the Folding doors is ye door of\r\n  the bed chamber where Mr. Walker keeps his fire arms of which he\r\n  has great numbers ready loaded. In the hall almost fronting the\r\n  street doors, are 2 which lead into a kitchen & a back yeard,\r\n  through which Mrs. Walker & the rest of the family separately\r\n  made their escape very soon after the entrance of the Ruffians._\r\n\r\n  “_The account which Mr. Walker gave to the Jury upon the trial\r\n  was that on the 6th of Decr. 1764 at ½ past 8 in the evening\r\n  Mrs. Walker looked at her watch and said it was time to go to\r\n  supper--that the cloth was laid in the hall but that he not\r\n  having been very well that day she was persuading him to stay &\r\n  eat his supper in the Parlour--that they staid about 10 or 15\r\n  minutes in this and other conversation & then went into the hall\r\n  to supper--that he sat with his back to, & very near the street\r\n  door--that he had been but a very little time at supper when he\r\n  heard a rattling of the latch of the door as of Persons wanting\r\n  to come in in a hurry--that Mrs. Walker said Entre, upon which\r\n  the outward door was thrown open & thro’ the sash of the inward\r\n  one he saw a great number of People disguised in various ways,\r\n  some with little round hats others with their faces blacked,\r\n  and others with crapes over their faces--that he had time to\r\n  take so much notice of them as to distinguish 2 Persons whose\r\n  faces tho’ blacked he was sure he should know again if he saw\r\n  them--that they burst the inward door & several of them got round\r\n  to the doors leading to the Parlour as designing to cut off his\r\n  retreat into that room--that upon turning his head towards that\r\n  room he received from behind a blow which he believes was given\r\n  with a broad sword,--that he passed thro’ them into the Parlour\r\n  receiving many wounds in the passage got to the further end of\r\n  the room near the chamber door before which stood 2 men who had\r\n  got before him & prevented his entrance into it--that these 2\r\n  with others who had followed him striking and wounding all the\r\n  way, sett upon him & forced him from the door into window, the\r\n  curtains of which entangled itself round him and he believes\r\n  prevented their dashing his brains out against the wall, that he\r\n  received in the whole no less than 52 contusions besides many\r\n  cuts with sharp instruments--that he believes during the struggle\r\n  in the window he was for some little time deprived of his senses,\r\n  sunk in stupefaction or stunned by some blow, till he heard a\r\n  voice from the opposite corner of the room say ‘Let me come at\r\n  him I will dispatch the Villian with my sword’ that this roused\r\n  him and determined him to sell his life as dear as he could--that\r\n  ’till this time tho’ he had apprehended & experienced a great\r\n  deal of violence, he did not think they intended to take away his\r\n  life because he had seen Major Disney in the outer room & knowing\r\n  he had done nothing to disoblige him, he did not believe that\r\n  he would have been amongst them if they had intended to murther\r\n  him--that he broke from the persons who held him in the window &\r\n  advanced towards the Part of the room from whence the voice came\r\n  where 2 persons were standing with their swords in a position\r\n  ready for making a thrust at him, but does not know whether they\r\n  actually made a Pass at him or not, that he put by one of their\r\n  swords with his left hand upon which they both retreated into\r\n  the corner--that his Eyes at this time being full of blood, he\r\n  was not capable of distinguishing the features of a face with\r\n  great accuracy, but from the size & figure & gesture of the\r\n  person whose sword he parried & from whom he believes the words\r\n  came, he thought it to be Major Disney--that several of them then\r\n  seized him at once (one of them in particular taking him up under\r\n  the right thigh) and carried him towards the fire place with\r\n  the intention as he believed to throw him upon the fire--that\r\n  the marks of his bloody fingers were upon the jamb of the\r\n  chimney--that he turned himself from the fire with great violence\r\n  & in turning received a blow on his head which the surgeons say\r\n  must have been given with a Tomahawk--which felled him to the\r\n  ground & after that a blow upon his Loins which he feels to this\r\n  day--that then one of them sat or kneeled by him (he lying at\r\n  his length upon the floor) andeavouring as he imagined to cut\r\n  his throat--that he resisted it by inclining his head upon his\r\n  shoulders & putting his hand to the place, a finger of which was\r\n  cut to the bone--that it was a fortnight before he knew that he\r\n  had lost his ear, his opinion all along having been that in that\r\n  operation they intended to cut his throat & believed they had\r\n  done it--that one of them said the Villian is dead, another Damn\r\n  him we have done for him, and a third uttered some words but his\r\n  senses then failed him & he does not recollect what they were._\r\n\r\n  “_This was the whole of the Evidence given by him in Court in\r\n  the cross-examination great stress was laid upon his positive\r\n  manner of swearing to Major Disney in disguise upon the transient\r\n  view which by his own account he had of him, and under the\r\n  circumstances of terrour and confusion which such an appearance\r\n  must have occasioned; to which he answered that he had time\r\n  in the hall before any blow was given to take a distinct view\r\n  of him, and that he actually did do it, and tho’ it was true\r\n  he had a crape over his face, yet it was tied so close that\r\n  he discerned the features and Lineaments of it very perfectly\r\n  and that he was positive it was Mr. Disney, of his dress other\r\n  than the crape upon his face he could give no account, and then\r\n  he was questioned if he had not often declared that he knew\r\n  nobody but upon slight surprise he said that he remembered Mr.\r\n  Disney perfectly the next morning, but that he mentioned him to\r\n  nobody but Mrs. Walker, charging her at the same time to conceal\r\n  it, because he thought he had suffered by her in discretion in\r\n  mentioning the name of another Person whose influence with People\r\n  in Power had prejudiced the inquiry which was then making into\r\n  the affair._\r\n\r\n  “_Mrs. Walker confirmed all the circumstances of their manner\r\n  of coming in & swore as directly to Major Disney, that Lieut.\r\n  Hamilton (as she did for some time believe but has since had\r\n  occasion to think she was mistaken) was the first that entered\r\n  that she saw Major Disney among a Groupe of figures very\r\n  distinctly with a crape over his face and dressed in a Canadian\r\n  Cotton Night Gown._\r\n\r\n  “_Magovock went thro’ his story as contained in his affidavit\r\n  a copy of which has been transmitted to your Lordship, not\r\n  without a manifest confusion of his countenance & a trembling\r\n  in his voice common to those who have a consciousness that they\r\n  are telling untruly, & a fear of being detected--his cross\r\n  examination took a great deal of time in the course of which he\r\n  contradicted all the other witnesses & himself in circumstances\r\n  so material that I am persuaded he was not himself present at the\r\n  transaction._\r\n\r\n  “_Major Disney proved by several witnesses, Dr. Robertson,\r\n  Madam Landrief, Madam Campbell & Mrs. Howard that he spent that\r\n  afternoon from 5 till ½ past 9 when he was sent for by Genl.\r\n  Burton (he being town Major, upon the uproar that this affair had\r\n  occasioned) at the house of Dr. Robertson--it was a particular\r\n  festival with the French of whom the company was mostly composed,\r\n  that he danced ’till supper time with Madam Landrief in the midst\r\n  of which Genl. Burton’s servant came & called him out--they spoke\r\n  all very positively to his being present the whole time & the\r\n  impossibility that he could be absent for 5 minutes without their\r\n  knowing it._\r\n\r\n  “_Upon this evidence the Jury went out of Court and in about an\r\n  hour returned with their Verdict Not Guilty--In justice to them\r\n  and to Major Disney I must declare that I am perfectly satisfied\r\n  with the Verdict._\r\n\r\n  “_Mr. Walker’s violence of temper and an inclination to find\r\n  People of rank in the Army concerned in this affair, has made\r\n  him a Dupe to the artifices of a Villian whose story could not\r\n  have gained credit but in a mind that came too much prejudiced\r\n  to receive it, the unhappy consequence of it I fear will be that\r\n  by mistaking the real objects of his Resentments the public will\r\n  be disappointed in the satisfaction of seeing them brought to\r\n  justice._\r\n\r\n  “_I should inform Your Lordship that the G. Jury inflamed with\r\n  Mr. Walker’s charge against them are preparing to bring in\r\n  several actions for words and have presented both him and Mrs.\r\n  Walker for Perjury--I have endeavoured to put a stop to both and\r\n  I hope I shall succeed._\r\n\r\n                    “_I have the honour to be_\r\n                                    “_My Lord_\r\n                 “_Yr. Lordship’s most obedt & humble servant_,\r\n                                                       “_W. Hey_.”\r\n\r\nThe report of the trial was printed by Brown and Gilmour at\r\nQuebec, it being the second book that appeared in Canada. The\r\nfirst book published is generally believed to be “Catechisme du\r\nDiocese de Sens Imprimé a Quebec chez, (Brown and Gilmour).” Brown\r\nand Gilmour were the printers of the first journal “The Quebec\r\nGazette” published on June 21, 1764. It was printed with columns\r\nof English and French and was issued weekly.\r\n\r\nWalker was afterward removed on the consideration of the Council\r\nfrom the commission of the peace at Montreal because of his\r\nseditionary tendencies and of the frequent accusations of his\r\ninsolent and overbearing temper which made it impossible for\r\nhis brother magistrates to associate with him. General Murray\r\nreluctantly consented if for no other reasons than his enemies\r\nwould otherwise see vindictiveness in his actions.\r\n\r\nOn the 27th of March, 1766, Walker, who had powerful friends\r\nin England, was ordered by His Majesty to be restored to the\r\nmagistracy. On the same day an order from the privy council\r\nwas issued by the governor of Michillimackinac and Detroit to\r\ngive him effectual assistance in his business pursuits. At\r\nthe same time stringent orders were given for the discovery\r\nof the perpetrators of the outrage on him. The government\r\noffered a reward of two hundred pounds, and of a free pardon\r\nand a discharge from the army to any person informing. Montreal\r\ninhabitants offered another three hundred pounds. But there was\r\nnothing done.\r\n\r\nBetween the actual outrage and the final acquittal of Captain\r\nDisney, Walker had been a thorn in the flesh to Murray. His\r\ndismissal from the bench made him no friend of the Governor and\r\nhe boasted afterwards that he had influenced Murray’s recall.\r\n\r\nThe first news of this likely recall came in 1765; on February\r\n3d Murray wrote lamenting that Mr. Walker should have known it\r\nbefore himself.\r\n\r\nMurray’s position was an unenviable one; his sympathy with the\r\nFrench Canadians was the basis of the anger of the little knot\r\nof powerful merchants against him; he was made the scape-goat\r\nfor the difficulties arising from the bad working of the\r\nunfavorable new civil government. In addition he had troubles\r\nwith the commandants of Montreal and Three Rivers who as military\r\ncommanders had much independent authority, over which Murray had\r\nno control, much to his chagrin. The constitutional documents\r\nof this period contain the petitions signed by twenty-one of\r\nthe merchants for his recall, and that of the seigneurs for his\r\nmaintenance. Their description of those allied against Murray\r\nruns thus: “A cabal of people who have come in the train of the\r\narmy as well as clerks and agents for the London merchants.”\r\nTheir testimony to Murray is his justification. “We were suited\r\nin the government of Mr. Murray. We knew his character, we were\r\nfully satisfied with his probity and his feelings of humanity; he\r\nwas fitted to bring your new subjects to a regard for the yoke of\r\nyour kindly domination by his care to make it light.”\r\n\r\nOn April 1, 1766, Conway, secretary of the colonies, wrote\r\nto Murray requesting his immediate return. He left Quebec on\r\nJune 28th, leaving the government in the hands of the senior\r\ncouncillor, Lieut.-Col. Aemilius Irving; on the same day there\r\narrived the new bishop, M. Briand to fill the vacancy left by\r\nPontbriand, who died in Montreal before the capitulation.\r\n\r\nThe result of the Walker outbreak was that Murray’s frequent\r\nrepresentations that barracks should be built were listened to\r\nand in 1765 they were erected, but hardly so, when in February,\r\n1766, they were burned down with all the stores placed there. A\r\npublic meeting was called to appeal for shelter for the soldiers,\r\nwho were again billeted upon the inhabitants, but with the\r\npromise that by May 1, houses should be hired for them. On his\r\nreturn to London Murray in his report to Shelburne on August 20,\r\n1766, had his revenge on the New England settlers whom he calls\r\nbroadly the most immoral collection of men he had ever known, and\r\nsays:\r\n\r\n“Magistrates were made and juries composed from four hundred and\r\nfifty contemptible sutters and traders. The judge pitched upon\r\nto conciliate the minds of seventy-five thousand foreigners to\r\nthe laws and government of Great Britain was taken from a jail,\r\nentirely ignorant of law and of the language of the people.\r\n\r\n“* * * On the other hand the Canadians, accustomed to an\r\narbitrary and a sort of military government, are a frugal,\r\nindustrious and moral race of men who from the just and mild\r\ntreatment they met with from His Majesty’s military officers that\r\nruled the country for four years past until the establishment of\r\nthe civil government had greatly got the better of the natural\r\nantipathy they had of their conquerers. They consist of the\r\nnoblesse who are numerous and who pride themselves much upon\r\nthe antiquity of their families, their own military glory and\r\nthat of their ancestors. These noblesse are Seigneurs of the\r\nwhole country and though not rich are in a situation, in that\r\nplentiful part of the world where money is scarce and luxury\r\nstill unknown, to support their dignity. The inhabitants, their\r\ntenanciers, who pay only annual quit rent of about a dollar for\r\none hundred acres, are at their ease and comfortable. They have\r\nbeen accustomed to respect and obey the noblesse; their tenure\r\nbeing military they have shared with them the dangers of the\r\nfield and natural affection has been increased in proportion to\r\nthe calamities which have been common to both in the country.\r\nSo they have been taught to respect their Seigneurs and not\r\nget intoxicated with the abuse of liberty; they are shocked at\r\nthe insults which their noblesse and the king’s officers have\r\nreceived from the English traders and lawyers since the civil\r\ngovernment took place.”\r\n\r\nHe adds: “The Canadian noblesse were hated because their birth\r\nand behaviour entitled them to respect and the peasants were\r\nabhorred because they were saved from the oppression they were\r\nthreatend with.”\r\n\r\nThe letter concludes: “I glory in having been accused of war\r\nwith unfairness in protecting the king’s Canadian subjects and\r\nof doing the utmost in my power to gain to my royal master the\r\naffections of that great, hardy people whose emigration, if ever\r\nit should happen, will be an irreparable loss to this country.”\r\n\r\nThough Murray was recalled it must not be assumed that his policy\r\nof colonial government was disapproved of by the ministers for\r\nit was not until April, 1768, that he relinquished the office\r\nof governor in chief. After a time the opposition between the\r\nmilitary and the magistrates died down, but the latter now became\r\na fertile source of oppression to the civil population.\r\n\r\nLet us then turn our attention to the Montreal justices of the\r\npeace. In 1769, reports had reached the Council at Quebec as\r\nto the oppresive practices of some of the magistrates of the\r\nMontreal district, and in consequence the council addressed\r\nto many of them on July 10, 1769, a letter of remonstrance\r\napplicable to “those magistrates only who had given occasion for\r\nthe complaint.”\r\n\r\nThe circular prepared by a committee of the Council was addressed\r\n“To the Justices of the Peace active in and for the district\r\nof Montreal.” It opened with a charge that “it appears from\r\nfacts too notorious to be dispelled that His Majesty’s subjects\r\nin general, but more particularly his Canadian subjects, are\r\ndaily injured and abused to a degree they are no longer able to\r\nsupport nor public justice endure.” The chief charges were of\r\nextorting excessive fees from litigants applying freely to the\r\ncourt and that in addition a low class of bailiffs, many of them\r\nFrench Canadians, who provoked and instituted lawsuits among the\r\ninhabitants were going about with blank forms signed with the\r\njustices’ names ready to be filled up at any moment. Thus abuses\r\nwere numerous.\r\n\r\nIn August a committee of the Council sat to consider further\r\nthe state of the administration of Justice under the justices\r\nof peace. A report was prepared and was read on August 29th and\r\nSeptember 11th. It was agreed to in the Castle of St. Louis\r\nby the council on September 14th, and Acting Attorney General\r\nKneller was instructed to prepare an ordinance on the point.\r\n\r\nThe report after stating that although the original powers\r\nin matters of property given to justices of the peace by the\r\nordinance of September 14, 1764, were exceedingly grievous and\r\noppressive to the subjects, yet even so “the authority given\r\nto the Justices hath been both too largely and too confidently\r\nentrusted and requires to be retrenched if not wholly taken\r\naway.” It then notices “The Justices of Montreal have in one\r\ninstance, and probably in many others which have passed without\r\nnotice, assumed to themselves powers of a nature not fit to\r\nbe exercised by any Summary Jurisdiction, whatsoever, in\r\nconsequence of which Titles to Land have been determined and\r\npossessions disturbed in a way unknown to the laws of England and\r\ninconsistent with the solemnity and deliberation which is due to\r\nmatters of so high and important a nature. And we are not without\r\ninformation, that even where personal property only has been in\r\ndispute, one magistrate in particular under pretense that it was\r\nat the desire and request of both the contending parties has by\r\nhimself exercised a jurisdiction considerably beyond what the\r\nordinance has allowed even to three Justices in full court at\r\ntheir Quarter Sessions.\r\n\r\n“From an omission of a similar nature and for want of\r\nascertaining the manner in which their judgments were to be\r\ninforced, we find the Magistrates to have assumed another very\r\nhigh and dangerous Authority in the exercise of which Gaols are\r\nconstantly filled with numbers of unhappy objects and whole\r\nfamilies reduced to beggery and ruin.”\r\n\r\nLater the report refers to evils “which will probably always be\r\nthe case when the office of a Justice of Peace is considered as a\r\nlucrative one and must infallibly be so when it is his principal,\r\nif not, only dependence.”\r\n\r\nOne consequence of the report was the appointment in the\r\nordinance of a Court of Common Pleas to be held before judges\r\nconstantly residing in the town of Montreal. This court was\r\nnow to be independent of, and with the same powers as, that\r\nat Quebec. Hitherto the latter had held adjourned meetings on\r\ndifferent days at Montreal. The object was to give inexpensive,\r\nspeedy and expert hearing to Montrealers.\r\n\r\nThe ordinance passed in the council on February 3, 1770, was\r\ntranslated and soon appears in English and French in the\r\n“Gazette.” When it appeared in Montreal it roused strong\r\nindignation among the magistrates whose powers were now\r\ncurtailed. A memorial signed by fifty signatures only was\r\npresented on the part of “merchants and others of the city of\r\nMontreal” with twenty objections to the Ordinance. Pierre du\r\nCalvet, a French Huguenot magistrate, was one of the indignant\r\nprotestors and his usual high-flown style characterizes his\r\nmemorial. According to Sir Guy Carleton’s statement to the\r\ndeputation they had issued handbills calling a meeting of the\r\npeople to discuss grievances, they had importuned and even\r\ninsulted several French Canadians because they would not join\r\nthem. Carleton who had now succeeded Murray in the Government\r\nof Canada warned them that they were acting against their own\r\ninterests, that the firm refusal of the Canadians as well as\r\nof most of their countrymen plainly showed the opinion the\r\ngenerality of the public entertained. In his letter to Lord\r\nHillsborough of the 25th of April, 1770, Carleton, however, after\r\npointing out the evils caused by the law as administered by the\r\njustices says: “Though I have great reason to be dissatisfied\r\nwith the conduct of some of the justices there are worthy men in\r\nthe commission of the peace in both districts and particularly in\r\nthis of Quebec.” (See Brymner’s Canadian Archives Report, 1890,\r\nwhose abstract is here used.)\r\n\r\nTo the credit of the better class of Montreal merchants of this\r\nperiod we must clearly dissociate the names of men who like\r\nJames McGill and others have deserved the city’s most grateful\r\nremembrance, from the inferior “grafters,” to use a modern term,\r\nthen exploiting the people. These were disapproved of by many of\r\ntheir own race. Carleton’s report of them to Lord Hillsborough\r\ndated Quebec, 28th of March, 1770, clearly designates the\r\n“rascals” of the day. “Your Lordship has already been informed\r\nthat the Protestants who have settled, or rather sojourned here\r\nsince the conquest, are composed only of Traders, disbanded\r\nsoldiers and officers, the latter, one or two excepted, below\r\nthe Rank of Captains, of those in the Commission of the Peace\r\nsuch as prospered in business could not give up their time to\r\nsit as Judges, and when several from accidents and ill-judged\r\nundertakings became Bankrupts they naturally sought to repair\r\ntheir broken fortunes at the expense of the people; hence a\r\nvariety of schemes to increase their business and their own\r\nemoluments. Bailiffs of their own creation, mostly French\r\nsoldiers either disbanded or Deserters, dispersed through the\r\nparishes with blank citations, catching at every little feud or\r\ndissension among the people, exciting them on to their Ruin and\r\nin a manner forcing them to litigate what, if left to themselves,\r\nmight have been easily accommodated, putting them to extravagant\r\nCosts for the Recovery of very small sums; their Lands, at a\r\ntime there is the greatest scarcity of money and consequently\r\nbut few Purchasers, exposed to hasty sales for the Payment of\r\nthe most trifling debts, and the money arising from these sales\r\nconsumed in exorbitant Fees, while the Creditors reaped little\r\nbenefit from the Destruction of their unfortunate Debtors. This,\r\nMy Lords, is but a very faint sketch of the Distresses of the\r\nCanadians and the cause of much Reproach to our National Justice\r\nand the King’s Government.” (Report Canadian Archives for 1890.)\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[1] For their action in this case Carleton removed their names\r\nfrom the council.\r\n\r\n[2] List of the grand jury of the district of Montreal before\r\nwhich bills were laid against the prisoners charged with the\r\nassault on Thomas Walker:\r\n\r\n  1.

The records of\r\nthe _Chambre de Milice de Montreal_ at present at Quebec reveal\r\neven in the civil disputes during the Interregnum of 1760-63\r\na boom in trade in Montreal such as those of the past never\r\nportrayed.\r\n\r\nThe early traders have been whipped unmercifully by Murray and\r\nCarleton but there were certainly some who were recognized as\r\n“very respectable merchants.” The British merchants were first\r\nat Quebec at its fall, and soon they also followed to Montreal\r\nat the Capitulation. Many were weeded out by failure and the\r\nclimate, but the residue that remained of the class of the canny\r\nmercantile adventurers who always adorn the hour of advancing\r\ncivilization, with the addition of more solid representatives of\r\nthe large English houses, was the foundation of the enterprising\r\nmerchant class of Quebec and Montreal, but especially of the\r\nlatter centre, which quickly seized the control of the wholesale\r\nbusiness, particularly the fur trade, the traffic with the\r\nIndians and the foreign commerce. Despite the narrowness of their\r\nvision and the jealous grasping after power due to them, they\r\nconsidered, as the conquering body, this small group of men by\r\ntheir superior activity, wealth and political skill came to wield\r\ngreat influence in the city and on the country on the whole well\r\nand wisely.\r\n\r\nHitherto, we have had to point out some of the weaknesses of\r\nthose of the less honourable and unsuccessful merchant class,\r\neven of those who became magistrates. It remains now to chronicle\r\nthe action of a well meaning body of the substantial business\r\nmen at Montreal toward consolidating the constitutional system\r\nof the country and developing it along British colonial lines.\r\nTheir political foresight was ahead of their time. Yet from\r\nthe earliest days of British rule the English merchants of\r\nMontreal, together with those of Quebec, certainly kept before\r\nthemselves and the Home Government the need of a representative\r\nassembly as promised to them, such as they had been familiar\r\nwith in other British colonies in America. Unfortunately the\r\ndesire to have this manned by Protestants only was made too\r\nevident from the outset and alienated the sympathy of those of\r\nthe French Canadians otherwise becoming well disposed. Their\r\nnarrow inherited spirit of intolerance, their conception of\r\nBritish rights, for they came “bearing all the laws of England\r\non their backs,” their belief in their own capabilities, their\r\nevident business success and the large capital they invested in\r\nCanada,[1] the strong conviction of the ultimate needs of such\r\nan institution, if ever the country was to be reduced to the\r\nsame uniformity as the other colonies where British institutions\r\nflourished, blinded them to the inopportuneness of the hour for\r\nthe establishment of such an assembly. They forgot, imbued as so\r\nmany of them were with democratic and republican tendencies, that\r\nthe New British Province was not an infant colony, but one which\r\nhad been long in existence and impregnated with French feudalism.\r\n\r\nAgain the upper classes were against the assembly, and the lower\r\nnot prepared by education[2] or desire, to take their share in\r\npopular government; much less were they inclined to be permitted\r\nto vote for a class who desired openly and not very discreetly to\r\nignore the political existence of their race.\r\n\r\nStill the merchants persisted. An opportunity was given by the\r\ndeparture of Carleton, who had asked leave of absence for a few\r\nmonths to place his views directly before the government, but\r\nit was not till 1774 that he returned. During that time his\r\ndelayed presence in London was valuable for consultation in the\r\npreparation of the “Quebec Act.” Carleton left behind his first\r\ncounsellor, a Swiss Protestant, Hector Theophile Cramahé, to act\r\nfor him. Carleton departed early in August and on the 9th Cramahé\r\nissued a proclamation declaring that the command had temporarily\r\ndevolved upon him. In 1771, on July 21st, Cramahé was appointed\r\nLieutenant Governor. Shortly after Carleton’s departure Cramahé\r\nsent two petitions to him to be presented to the King’s Most\r\nExcellent Majesty.\r\n\r\nThe first was that of the Quebec and Montreal British\r\nfree-holders, merchants and traders on behalf of themselves and\r\nothers. His Majesty is reminded of his direction to governors\r\nin his Royal proclamation of the 7th of October in the third\r\nyear of his reign, that general assemblies should be called\r\nas soon as the state and circumstances thereof would admit,\r\nin such manner as is used in the provinces of America under\r\nHis Majesty’s immediate government. The arguments adduced are,\r\nthat such an assembly would strengthen the hands of government,\r\ngive encouragement and protection to agriculture and commerce,\r\nincrease the public revenue and in time would be a happy means of\r\nuniting the new subjects in a due conformity to the British laws\r\nand customs.\r\n\r\nThe memorialists represented: “That Your Majesty’s British\r\nsubjects residing in this province have set examples and given\r\nevery encouragement in their power to promote industry, are\r\nthe principal importers of British manufactures, carry on\r\nthree-fourths of the trade of this country, annually return a\r\nconsiderable revenue into Your Majesty’s exchequer in Great\r\nBritain; and though the great advantages this country is\r\nnaturally capable of, are many and obvious, for promoting the\r\ntrade and manufactures of the mother country, yet for some time\r\npast both the landed and commercial interests have been declining\r\nand if a General Assembly is not soon ordered by Your Majesty\r\nto make and enforce due obedience to laws for encouraging\r\nagriculture, regulating the trade, discouraging such importations\r\nfrom the other colonies as impoverish the Province, your\r\npetitioners have the greatest reason to apprehend their own ruin\r\nas well as that of the province in general.\r\n\r\n“That there is now a sufficient number of Your Majesty’s subjects\r\nresiding in and possessed of real property in this province and\r\nwho are otherwise qualified to be members of a General Assembly.”\r\n\r\nThis petition is signed by thirty-one of the principal merchants.\r\nIt will be noticed that there are only two of these names that\r\nappeared on the petition of 1765 for the assembly and the recall\r\nof Murray. The whole document is more dignified. The memorialists\r\nare men of great weight. Their claim as the developers of\r\ncommerce is undoubted. The only weakness lay in the concluding\r\nclause which is merely the outcome of the traditional intolerance\r\nthen in vogue but which was to be the chief cause of the delay of\r\ntheir efforts till the act of 1791 at last crowned their efforts.\r\nAmong the Montreal signatures in the above memorial are those of\r\nAlexander Henry, John Porteous, James McGill, Alexander Paterson,\r\nRichard Dobie, J. Fraser and Isaac Todd.\r\n\r\nThe above memorial was set off by that of fifty-nine “Canadian”\r\nleaders who appealed for the restoration of their customs and\r\nusages according to the laws, customs and regulations under which\r\nthey were born and which served as the basis and foundations of\r\ntheir possessions. They also ask not to be excluded from offices\r\nin the service of the king. The petition is to be presented by\r\nSir Guy Carleton. “It is to this worthy representative of Your\r\nMajesty who perfectly comprehends the ambitions of this colony\r\nand the customs of this people that we confide our most humble\r\nsupplications to be conveyed to the foot of your throne.”\r\n\r\nThe year 1773 saw great activity in the duel; the case of the\r\nold and new subjects was being argued in London. The most\r\neminent statesmen and lawyers, state officials, were studying\r\nthe numerous documents in view of the proposed Quebec act of\r\nsettlement. The merchants of Montreal and Quebec determined to\r\nmake a great effort. In the winter of 1772 Thomas Walker, of\r\nMontreal, and Zachary Macaulay, of Quebec, had already conferred\r\nin London with Masères about the prospect of an Assembly.\r\nMazères, though now a cursitor baron of the exchequer, still\r\nkept his interest in Canadian affairs as when attorney general\r\nat Quebec. There is no name more prominent among those who\r\ncontributed to the elucidation of the difficulties of this time\r\nthan this able man. His Huguenot upbringing, however, somewhat\r\nwarped his otherwise calm judgment in surveying the French\r\nCanadian position, yet his was a warning of the opportunist. “I\r\ntold them,” wrote Masères to Dartmouth on January 4, 1774, “that\r\nI thought a legislative council, consisting of only Protestants\r\nand much more numerous than the present, and made perfectly\r\nindependent of the Governor so as to be neither removable nor\r\nsuspendible by him on any pretense but only removable by the\r\nKing in council, would be a better instrument for that province\r\nthan an assembly for seven or eight years to come, and until the\r\nProtestant religion and English manners, laws and affections\r\nshall have made a little more progress there and especially an\r\nassembly unto which any Catholics shall be admitted.”\r\n\r\nThe two representatives, however, seemed to have been resolved\r\nto push for an Assembly for they were both found to be on the\r\ncommittee organized for that purpose on October 30, 1773,\r\nin Quebec at Miles Prenties’ Inn. The meeting was called by\r\nJohn McCord. The circumstances are related by Cramahé’s letter\r\nto Dartmouth of December 13th when he inclosed the final\r\npetitions sent to him by the merchants. “About six weeks or\r\ntwo months ago a Mr. McCord from the north of Ireland, who\r\nsettled here soon after the conquest, where he picked up a\r\nvery comfortable livelihood by the retailing business in which\r\nhe is a considerable dealer, the article of spiritous liquors\r\nespecially, summoned the principal inhabitants of this town that\r\nare Protestants to meet at a tavern where he proposed to them,\r\napplying for a house of assembly.”\r\n\r\nThe transactions, of the meeting called by McCord and of the\r\nsubsequent ones, were recorded and sent to Masères by Quebec\r\nand Montreal citizens. He was thought to be the right person to\r\napproach as their agent, to have their case ventilated in London.\r\nThey wrote to him on November 8, 1773, “The British inhabitants\r\nof whom we are appointed a committee are of very moderate\r\nprinciples. They wish for an assembly as they know that to be\r\nthe only sure means of conciliating the new subjects, etc.” How\r\nthe assembly is to be composed is a matter of the most serious\r\nconsideration; “They would submit that to the wisdom of His\r\nMajesty’s council.”\r\n\r\nThey had evidently become less exacting in their demands that it\r\nshould be reserved for Protestants. What they really wanted was\r\nthe Assembly.\r\n\r\nThe meeting at Miles Prenties’ in the Upper Town held on October\r\n30th resulted in a committee of eleven being formed to draw up a\r\npetition for an assembly. The following were the eleven: William\r\nGrant, John Wells, Charles Grant, Anthony Vialars, Peter Fargues,\r\nJenkin Williams, John Lees, Zachary Macaulay, Thomas Walker (of\r\nMontreal), Malcolm Fraser (secretary), John McCord (chairman). It\r\nwas resolved that a copy of the minutes be sent to the gentlemen\r\nof Montreal. At the second meeting at Prenties’, November 2d\r\n(Tuesday), it was resolved to translate the petition into French\r\nand that the principal French inhabitants be invited to meet them\r\nat Prenties’ on Thursday, November 4th. It was further resolved\r\nto send a copy of the minutes and a draft of the petition by\r\nnext post to Montreal addressed to Mr. Gray, to be communicated\r\nto the inhabitants of Montreal. On Thursday, November 4th, of\r\nthe fifteen invitations sent out only eight French gentlemen\r\nappeared. The translation of the petition was read, and the\r\nclause on the composition of the assembly according to His\r\nMajesty’s wisdom, doubtless noted. After discussion M. Decheneaux\r\nand M. Perras undertook to convene a meeting of their fellow\r\nFrench citizens at 2 o’clock on Saturday next, to interest them\r\nin furthering the petition.\r\n\r\nOn Monday, November 8th, the English committee met at Prenties’.\r\nBeing anxious to know what measures had been taken by the French\r\non Saturday, Malcolm Fraser sent a note by a bearer to M. Perras,\r\nM. Decheneaux being out of town. A brief reply was sent back\r\ndated Quebec, 8-10th November, saying that the hasty departure of\r\nthe vessels for Europe had not permitted him to reply according\r\nto his desire; “However I have seen some of my fellow citizens\r\nwho do not appear to me to be disposed to assemble as some of\r\nus could wish. ‘Le grand nombre l’emporte et le petit reduit a\r\nprendre patience.’”\r\n\r\nThe next meeting of the committee was to be called at the\r\ndiscretion of the secretary as “the business will depend on the\r\nletters to be received from Montreal.”\r\n\r\nCramahé, explaining to Dartmouth, who had succeeded Hillsborough\r\nas Colonial Secretary, the want of cooperation by the French,\r\nsays: “The Canadians, suspecting their only view was to push them\r\nforward to ask, without really intending their participation\r\nof the privilege, declined joining them here or at Montreal.”\r\nHad the petition asked for the abolition of the religious test\r\nand the inclusion of Catholics in the assembly the Canadians\r\nwould have doubtless cooperated. The petition was presented\r\non December 4, 1773; the Quebec (fifty-two) and Montreal\r\n(thirty-nine) signatures are both dated November 29th. It was\r\npresented to Cramahé as the Lieutenant Governor and he was prayed\r\nin accordance with the powers given the Governor by the Royal\r\nproclamation of 1763: “To summon and call a general assembly of\r\nthe freeholders and planters within your government in such a\r\nmanner as you in your jurisdiction shall judge most proper.” As\r\nthe words stand it may be argued that the merchants were ready\r\nto forego their Protestantism in favour of a mixed assembly, but\r\nevidently the acting Governor had his doubts. Cramahé therefore\r\nanswered cautiously, as was expected, “That the petition was\r\naltogether of too much importance for His Majesty’s Council here\r\nto advise at a time when the affairs of the province were likely\r\nto become an object of public regulation. The petition and his\r\nanswer would be transmitted to His Majesty’s Secretary of State.”\r\n\r\nThe second petition already arranged for, and containing the\r\nanswer of Cramahé, was prepared and sent to the King’s Most\r\nExcellent Majesty, praying him “to direct Your Majesty’s Governor\r\nor Commander in Chief to call a general assembly in such manner\r\nand of such constitution and form as to Your Majesty, in your\r\nRoyal wisdom, shall seem best adapted to secure its peace,\r\nwelfare and good government.” Besides the copy sent through\r\nCramahé to Dartmouth, the committee sent another to Masères to\r\nenable him to present their case and to communicate its purport\r\nto their mercantile associates in London. The signatures of the\r\nQuebec subscribers, dated December 31, 1773, numbered sixty-one,\r\nthose of Montreal dated January 10, 1774, reached eighty-one.\r\n\r\nCramahé’s comment on these signatures in his letter to Dartmouth\r\nreads: “It may not be amiss to observe that there are not above\r\nfive among the signers to the two petitions who can be properly\r\nstyled freeholders and the value of four of these freeholds\r\nis very inconsiderable. The number of those possessing houses\r\nin the towns of Quebec and Montreal, or farms in the country\r\nheld of the king for some private seigneur upon paying a yearly\r\nacknowledgment, is under thirty.”\r\n\r\nAs an offset, the memorial to the petition sent by the seigneurs\r\nand principal Catholics about February, 1774, and made in\r\nopposition to an assembly, urges the granting of their request\r\n“because we possess more than ten out of twelve of all the\r\nseigneuries of the province and almost all the lands of the other\r\ntenures or which are holden by rent service.”\r\n\r\nIn addition to the petition to the king signed by the “ancient\r\nand loyal subjects” of Quebec and Montreal, two memorials to Lord\r\nDartmouth were separately sent by the promoting committees at\r\neither place. These seemed to have been presented through Masères\r\nsince they are not indorsed, as were the petitions to the king,\r\nas received through Cramahé.\r\n\r\nThe Montreal memorial urging the furtherance of their petition\r\nis dated Montreal, January 15, 1774, and signed by a committee\r\nappointed at a general meeting of the inhabitants of Edw. W.\r\nGray, R. Huntley, Lawrence Ermatinger, Will Haywood, James\r\nMcGill, James Finlay, Edward Chinn.\r\n\r\nThe memorial included a new element, viz., “Your Lordship’s\r\nmemorialists further see with regret the great danger that\r\nchildren born of Protestant parents are in of being utterly\r\nneglected for want of a sufficient number of Protestant pastors\r\nand thereby exposed to the usual and known assiduity of the Roman\r\nCatholic clergy of different orders who are very numerous and who\r\nfor their own friends have lately established a Seminary for the\r\neducation of youths in this province, which is the more alarming\r\nas it excludes all Protestant teachers of any science whatever.”\r\nThe name of James McGill, the founder afterwards of McGill\r\nUniversity, is significant, therefore, on this petition.\r\n\r\nThe counter petition and the memorial accompanying it, signed by\r\nsixty-five of the noblesse, followed in February, 1774. Thus the\r\nduel went on. We delay recounting its outcome till the case for\r\nthe Seigneurs is more fully disclosed in the next chapter.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[1] Witness the appeal for Murray’s recall. Thomas Walker is said\r\nto have brought ten thousand pounds into the province.\r\n\r\n[2] M. Lothbiniere, the representative of the noblesse in London\r\nsaid that he doubted whether more than four or five persons in a\r\nparish could read.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                           CHAPTER VI\r\n\r\n                     THE QUEBEC ACT OF 1774\r\n\r\n            THE NOBLESSE OF THE DISTRICT OF MONTREAL\r\n\r\n  THE GRIEVANCES OF THE SEIGNEURS--MONTREAL THE\r\n    HEADQUARTERS--“EVERY INTRIGUE TO OUR DISADVANTAGE WILL BE\r\n    HATCHED THERE”--PETITIONS--CARLETON’S FEAR OF A FRENCH\r\n    INVASION--A SECRET MEETING--PROTESTS OF MAGISTRATES TODD AND\r\n    BRASHAY--PROTESTS OF CITIZENS--CARLETON’S CORRESPONDENCE FOR\r\n    AN AMENDED CONSTITUTION IN FAVOUR OF THE NOBLESSE--THE QUEBEC\r\n    ACT--ANGLICIZATION ABANDONED.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe _Noblesse_ of the district of Montreal are now to play a\r\ngreat part in the making of the constitutional history of Canada.\r\nThey had appreciated the government of Murray and had petitioned\r\nfor his continuance but in vain. At the same time while thanking\r\nthe king for the appointment of the Bishop Briand which was\r\na great concession, they asked for two favours: first, the\r\nsuppression of the Land Register, the expense of which exhausted\r\nthe colony without its drawing any profit therefrom; second,\r\nthat all the subjects of this province without any distinction\r\nof religion should be admitted to all offices without any other\r\nqualifications but those of talent and personal merit; for to\r\nbe excluded by the state from having any participation in it is\r\nnot to be a member of the state. This petition was signed by\r\nChevalier D’Ailleboust and thirty-nine other seigneurs and was\r\nendorsed as received on February 3, 1767.\r\n\r\nThe grievance of the seigneurs in the latter request was briefly\r\nthis: that though the French Canadians were not obliged by the\r\nRoyal Instructions of 1763 to take the oath of the test of\r\nallegiance, supremacy and religious abjuration, yet these oaths\r\nwere obligatory on all who would hold an appointment under\r\ngovernment such as members of the proposed assembly, civil\r\nand military officials, etc. Hence the constant effort of the\r\nnoblesse to remove this odious civil disability continued until\r\nin 1774 the act of Quebec made it disappear and saw a formula\r\nsubstituted which was acceptable to all honest and conscientious\r\n“new subjects.” The following oath, afterwards taken almost\r\ntextually by Bishop Briand, in the light of today will be seen to\r\nbe quite adequate:\r\n\r\n  “Je, A.B. promets et jure sincèrement que Je serai fidèle et\r\n  porterai vraie allégeance à Sa Majesté le roi George, que Je\r\n  le défendrai de tout mon pouvoir contre toutes conspirations\r\n  perfides et tous attentats quelconques, dirigés contre sa\r\n  personne, sa couronne et sa dignité; et que Je ferai tous mes\r\n  efforts pour découvrir et faire connaitre à Sa Majesté, ses\r\n  heretiers et successeurs, toutes trahisons et conspirations\r\n  perfides et tous attentats que Je saurai dirigés contre lui ou\r\n  chacun d’eux; et tout cela, Je le jure sans aucune équivoque\r\n  subterfuge mental ou restriction secrète, renoncant pour m’en\r\n  relever, à tous pardons et dispenses de personne ou pouvoir\r\n  quelconques.\r\n\r\n  “Ainsi que Dieu me soit en aide,”\r\n\r\nThe same form taken from the English was as follows:\r\n\r\n  “I, A.B., do sincerely promise and swear that I will be faithful\r\n  and bear true allegiance to His Majesty, King George, and that I\r\n  will defend him to the utmost of my power against all traitorous\r\n  conspiracies and attempts whatever, which shall be made against\r\n  His Person, Crown and Dignity, and that I will do my utmost\r\n  endeavor to disclose and make known to His Majesty, His Heirs or\r\n  Successors, all treasons and traitorous conspiracies and attempts\r\n  which I shall know to be against him or any of them; And all this\r\n  I do swear without any equivocation, mental evasion or secret\r\n  reservation and renouncing all pardons and dispensations from any\r\n  Person or Power whichever to the Contrary.\r\n\r\n  “So help me God.”\r\n\r\nAfter the recall of Murray the seigneurs and clergy had looked\r\nforward to the arrival of the new lieutenant governor, Sir Guy\r\nCarleton, who reached Quebec on September 23, 1766, to relieve\r\nCol. Aemiluis Irving, who had acted for nearly three months as\r\nadministrator on the departure of General Murray. He did not\r\nbecome governor-in-chief until October 25, 1769, Murray yielding\r\nup the government about April, 1768.\r\n\r\nIt may be noted that Carleton’s first message to the Council is\r\none which promulgated the doctrine Salvation through Harmony or,\r\nSafety in Concord, which under the form of “Concordia Salus” is\r\nthat now recognized as the official motto of the City of Montreal:\r\n\r\n  “Gentlemen of the Council:\r\n\r\n  “I return you Thanks for your kind and dutiful Address and for\r\n  the Respect shown to His Majesty’s Commission; I doubt not but I\r\n  shall always find your hearty Concurrence to Everything I shall\r\n  propose for the Good of His Service.\r\n\r\n  “My present Demand is that all may join to preserve good Humour\r\n  and a perfect Harmony, first among His Majesty’s natural born\r\n  Subjects, also between His Subjects by Birth and His Subjects by\r\n  Acquisition, so that no Distinction may be noted but the great\r\n  Difference between good men and bad. As the Good and Happiness\r\n  of His People is the first Object with the King, our Sovereign,\r\n  we must all know, nothing would be more acceptable to them; We\r\n  must all Feel nothing can be more agreeable to the great Laws of\r\n  Humanity.\r\n\r\n      “Quebec, 24th Sept., 1766.”\r\n\r\nThe new Governor soon found that in proportion to the arrogance\r\nof the English-speaking minority demanding an assembly in which\r\nthey would be the sole representatives, the noblesse were\r\nbecoming increasingly restless, for while accepting the English\r\ncriminal law they demanded their French civil code and customs\r\nunmodified. Carleton was inclined to accept this view, but\r\nMasères, the attorney-general, who had presented lengthy reports\r\non the situation and had pointed out his own remedies, argued\r\nthat the English law should be the basis of jurisdiction with the\r\nadmission of certain sections of Canadian law and customs which\r\nwould have been acceptable to the English inhabitants, also. He\r\nrecommended the immediate preparation of a code reviving the\r\nFrench law relating to tenure, dower and inheritance of landed\r\nproperty, and the distribution of the effects of persons who died\r\nintestate.\r\n\r\nWhat may have influenced Carleton in his willingness to concede\r\nso much to the demand of the seigneurs was the fear of the\r\nmovement spreading in Canada among the seigneurs to cast off\r\nBritish rule. His attention was drawn to Montreal as the center\r\nof the secret negotiations and dissatisfaction. General Murray\r\nin his letter of October 29, 1764, had already pointed out to\r\nthe Lords of Trade and Plantation the difficulties likely to be\r\ncreated there if the Canadians were not accepted on juries. “I\r\nbeg leave,” he says, “further to represent to Your Lordship that\r\na lieutenant-governor at Montreal is absolutely necessary; that\r\ntown is in the heart of the most populous part of the province.\r\nIt is surrounded by the Indian nations and is 180 miles from\r\nthe capital. It is there that the most opulent priests live and\r\nthere are settled the greatest part of the French noblesse,\r\nconsequently every intrigue to our disadvantage will be hatched\r\nthere.” (“Canadian Archives,” Vol. II, page 233.)\r\n\r\nOne of the causes of General Murray’s allusions to plots at\r\nMontreal at this time may have been the presence of Ensign\r\nWilliam Forsyth who had commanded an independent patrol of\r\nScotch settlers in New Hampshire during the Indian war along the\r\nborder, shortly after the session of Canada in 1763. He had been\r\nwounded and escaped to Montreal. He was related to several of\r\nthe Canadian noblesse, particularly that of the Denys family. It\r\nis suggested that on the occasion of this visit there may have\r\nbeen planted the germs of an alliance between the French noblesse\r\nand the Scotch legitimists in favour of a Stuart dynasty which\r\nafterwards ripened into a more complete understanding.\r\n\r\nOn January 7, 1763, a petition signed by ninety-five of the chief\r\ninhabitants, including Montrealers such as Guy, and Jacques\r\nHervieux, was presented to the king, protesting against the\r\nattitude of the British minority in excluding them from the law\r\ncourts and asking for a confirmation of the privileges contained\r\nin Murray’s act for French Canadians. “Who are they that wish to\r\nproscribe us? About thirty English merchants of whom fifteen at\r\nthe most are settled. Who are the proscribed? Ten thousand heads\r\nof families who breathe only submission to Your Majesty’s orders.”\r\n\r\nCan it be wondered that at Montreal, the headquarters of the\r\nseigneurs, there is much dissatisfaction? The seigneurs at this\r\ntime in petitioning the king for the maintenance of General\r\nMurray complained: “Our hopes have been destroyed by the\r\nestablishment of the civil government that had been so highly\r\nextolled; we saw rise with it cabal, trial and confusion.” This\r\nmay be taken as their prevailing attitude of mind.\r\n\r\nOn the 25th of November, 1767, Carleton wrote a remarkable letter\r\nin which, forecasting the possibility of a French war surprising\r\nthe province, he recommends “The building of a citadel within\r\nthe town of Quebec that the troops might have a fort capable of\r\nbeing defended by their numbers till succour could be sent them\r\nfrom home or from the neighbouring colonies; for should a French\r\nwar surprise the province in its present condition the Canadian\r\nofficers sent from France with troops might assemble such a body\r\nof people as will render the king’s dominion over the province\r\nvery precarious while it depends on a few troops in an extensive\r\nfort open in many places.” (“Archives,” Series Q, Vol. V, page\r\n250.)\r\n\r\nAgain Carleton, in the same letter to Shelburne, feared the\r\npossibility of former French officers, especially those who left\r\nafter the capitulation, being sent back to Canada to lead an\r\nuprising. He knew these had been encouraged to return to France\r\nand were being upkept as a separate body with pay. “For these\r\nreasons,” he says, “I imagine, an edict was published in 1672,\r\ndeclaring that, notwithstanding the low state of the king’s\r\nfinances, the salary of the captains of the colony troops of\r\nCanada should be raised from 450 _livres_, the establishment by\r\nwhich their pay was fixed at first, to 600 _livres_ a year, to\r\nbe paid quarterly, upon the footing of officers in full pay, by\r\nthe treasurer of the colonies, at the quarters assigned them by\r\nHis Majesty in Tourraine, and that such of them as did not repair\r\nthither should be struck off, the king’s intentions being that\r\nthe said officers should remain in that province until further\r\norders, and not depart from thence without a written leave from\r\nthe secretary of state for the marine department.\r\n\r\n“A few of these officers had been sent to the other colonies, but\r\nthe greater part still remained in Tourraine, and the arrears\r\ndue to those who have remained any time in this country are\r\npunctually discharged, upon their emigration, from them and\r\nobedience to the above mentioned injunction.\r\n\r\n“By the secretary of state’s letter a certain quantity of wine,\r\nduty free, is admitted to enter the towns where these Canadian\r\nofficers quarter, for their use according to their several ranks.”\r\n\r\nIn a further letter to Shelburne of December, 1767, he again\r\nclearly recognized the difficult political situation. “The most\r\nadvisable method in my opinion for removing the present as well\r\nas for preventing future evils is to repeal that ordinance\r\n(of September 17, 1764) as null and void in its own nature\r\nand for the present leave the Canadian laws almost entire;\r\nsuch alterations might be afterwards made in them as time and\r\noccurrences rendered the same advisable so as to reduce them to\r\nthat system His Majesty shall think fit, without risking the\r\ndangers of too much precipitation; or else such alterations might\r\nbe made in the old and new laws judged necessary to be inevitably\r\nintroduced and publish the whole as a Canadian code as was\r\npracticed by Edward I after the conquest of Wales.”\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the seigneurs were not idle. In 1767 there was\r\nan assembly at Montreal of the noblesse presided over by\r\nthe Chevalier D’Ailleboust and the petition was signed of\r\nremonstrance to the king, dated February 3d, already quoted,\r\nagainst discrimination against them.\r\n\r\nThis leads us to ask the question: Did the seigneurial body\r\nmeet in open or secret conclave when their interests were to be\r\nsafeguarded? Both kinds of conclaves would seem likely. It is\r\ncertain, however, that such meetings were as far as possible\r\nprevented. Garneau “Histoire du Canada,” 4th edit., (Vol. II,\r\npage 400) relates that in 1766 Hertel de Rouville in the name\r\nof the seigneurs of Montreal applied for permission for the\r\nseigneurs to meet, which was granted on condition that two of\r\nthe Supreme Council should be present with power to dissolve the\r\ngathering. When the seigneurs assembled General Burton, who had\r\nnot been warned, wrote to the magistrates who replied that all\r\nwas in order. “In any case,” replied the suspicious general, “if\r\nyou have any need of assistance I will send it you.” The meeting\r\nwas called by Hertel de Rouville “by a particular order of the\r\nGovernor and Council” who doubtless thought by conciliating the\r\nseigneurs, so far the responsible representatives of the people,\r\nthat peaceful relations could be maintained with the new subjects.\r\n\r\nA document recently unearthed by Mr. Massicotte, at the\r\nCourt House archives, reveals that on the 3d of March, 1766,\r\nthe Montreal merchants met in the house of James Crofton,\r\ninn-keeper “to protect against the meeting of the seigneurs\r\nheld in the public court house on Friday, February 21st, 1766.”\r\nTheir declaration before Edward William Gray, “Notary and\r\nTabellion Publick,”[1] protested that the seigneurs had been\r\nunconstitutionally chosen at the different parish meetings to\r\nrepresent the inhabitants of the seignories as agents “without\r\nthe knowledge or consent of the magistrates of the districts, the\r\ncommander-in-chief of His Majesty’s forces or the inhabitants\r\nof the city;” that these separate meetings not only for the\r\nentire exclusion of His Majesty’s ancient British subjects in\r\ngeneral but of the mercantile part of His Majesty’s new subjects,\r\ndid not make for unity or content. They further protested that\r\n“several of His Majesty’s British subjects who are possessed\r\nof seignories never received an order or summons to this said\r\nmeeting.” The declaration further states that upon the principal\r\nEnglish and French citizens assembling at the courthouse in\r\norder to be present at and know the cause of the public meeting\r\nthey were informed by Adam Mabane, Esq., one of His Majesty’s\r\ncouncil for the province that their presence was not necessary,\r\nas the meeting did not regard them and ordered them out. There\r\nwere two of His Majesty’s justices of the peace present, Isaac\r\nTodd and Thomas Brashay, who “the public, thinking they had been\r\ngiven sanction to it, expressed them in such a manner that they\r\nsent down their resignation to the governor.” The malcontents\r\nwithdrew under the impression that representatives for the\r\npeople were being chosen without their consent. They flattered\r\nthemselves, however, that when the house of assembly promised in\r\nHis Majesty’s proclamation should come “His Majesty’s ancient\r\nsubjects will be permitted at least to have a share in the choice\r\nof their representatives.”\r\n\r\nThe document written in English and French is signed in the\r\nformer by John Wells, R. Stenhouse, Mathew Lessey, Samuel Holmes,\r\nJohn Stenhouse, G. Young, Joseph Howard, Lawrence Ermatinger,\r\nMathew Wade, James Price, Thomas Barron, Jonas Desaulles,\r\nRichard Dobie, William Haywood, John Blake, and in the French\r\nby Jean Orilliat, Le Cavelier Pappalon, Le Prohon Dissan, Guy,\r\nAm.

The king’s old subjects in this province,\r\n  supposing them all willing, might furnish about five hundred men\r\n  able to bear arms, exclusive of his troops; that is, supposing\r\n  all the king’s troops and old subjects collected in Quebec; with\r\n  two months’ hard labor they might put the works in a tolerable\r\n  state of repair and would amount to about one-third the forces\r\n  necessary for its defense. The new subjects could send into\r\n  the field about eighteen thousand men well able to carry arms;\r\n  of which number above one-half had already served with as much\r\n  valour, with more zeal and more military knowledge for America\r\n  than the regular troops of France that were joined with them.\r\n  As the common people are greatly to be influenced by their\r\n  Seigneurs, I annex a Return[4] of the noblesse of Canada, showing\r\n  with tolerable exactness their age; rank and present place of\r\n  abode, together with such natives of France as served in the\r\n  colony troops so early in life as to give them a knowledge of the\r\n  country, an acquaintance and influence over the people equal to\r\n  natives of the same rank; from whence it appears that there are\r\n  in France and in the French service about one hundred officers,\r\n  all ready to be sent back in case of a war to a country they are\r\n  intimately acquainted with and with the assistance of some troops\r\n  to stir up a people accustomed to pay them implicit obedience.\r\n  It further shows there remain in Canada not more than seventy of\r\n  those who ever had been in the French service; not one of them\r\n  in the king’s service nor any one who from any motive whatever\r\n  is induced to support his government and dominion; gentlemen who\r\n  have lost their employment at least by becoming his subjects and\r\n  as they are not bound by any offices of trust or profit we should\r\n  only deceive ourselves by supposing they would be active in the\r\n  defense of a people that has deprived them of their honours,\r\n  privileges, profits and laws and in their stead have introduced\r\n  much expence, chicannery and confusion with a deluge of new laws\r\n  unknown and unpublished. Therefore, all circumstances considered,\r\n  while matters continue in their present state, the most we can\r\n  hope for from the gentlemen who remain in this province is a\r\n  passive neutrality on all occasions, a respectful submission to\r\n  government and deference for the king’s commission in whatever\r\n  hand it may be lodged; this they almost to a man have persevered\r\n  in since my arrival, notwithstanding much pains have been taken\r\n  to engage them in parties by a few whose duty and whose office\r\n  should have taught them better. * * *\r\n\r\n  “Having arrayed the strength of His Majesty’s old and new\r\n  subjects and shewn the great superiority of the latter, it may\r\n  not be amiss to observe there is not the least probability this\r\n  present superiority should ever be diminished. On the contrary\r\n  ’tis more than probable it will increase and strengthen daily.\r\n  The Europeans who migrate never will prefer the long inhospitable\r\n  winters of Canada to the more cheerful climates and more fruitful\r\n  soil of His Majesty’s southern provinces; the few old subjects at\r\n  present in this province have been mostly left here by accident\r\n  and are either disbanded officers, soldiers or followers of the\r\n  army, who not knowing how to dispose of themselves elsewhere,\r\n  settled where they could at the Reduction; or else they are\r\n  adventurers in trade or such as could not remain at home, who set\r\n  out to mend their fortunes at the opening of this new channel for\r\n  commerce, but experience has taught almost all of them that this\r\n  trade requires a strict frugality they are strangers to, or to\r\n  which they will not submit; so that some from more advantageous\r\n  views elsewhere, others from necessity, have already left this\r\n  province and I fear many more for the same reason will follow\r\n  their example in a few years; but while this severe climate and\r\n  the poverty of the country discourages all but the natives, its\r\n  healthfulness is such that these multiply daily so that, barring\r\n  a catastrophe shocking to think of, this country must to the end\r\n  of time be peopled by a Canadian race who already have taken\r\n  such a firm root and got to so great a height that any new stock\r\n  transplanted will be totally hid and imperceptible amongst them\r\n  except in the towns of Quebec and Montreal.”\r\n\r\nThis last consideration no doubt largely influenced Carleton in\r\nhis readiness to uphold the ancient laws and customs. He had not\r\nthe vision of an English-speaking Dominion such as that of today,\r\nof which the British merchants of Montreal and Quebec of the\r\nearly days with all their faults were laying the sure foundation\r\nby their commercial enterprise and dogged pertinacity.\r\n\r\nWriting again to Shelburne on December 24, 1767, Carleton reminds\r\nhis Lordship that the colony had submitted to His Majesty’s\r\narms on certain conditions. He doubtless had in view, good tory\r\nas he was, the objection of the noblesse to the institution\r\nof a democratic representative assembly already urged by the\r\nmerchants of Quebec and Montreal with their experience of such\r\nin the English colonies, as inimical to the established order of\r\nthings, for the system of laws so long in vogue before the act of\r\n1763 maintained the subordination between the different social\r\ndivisions from the highest to the most humble ranks and upheld\r\nthe harmony now being threatened, thus keeping this far-off\r\nprovince in its loyalty to the crown.\r\n\r\nOn January 20, 1768, he again wrote recommending the inclusion,\r\nin the Council and the army, of a number of the noblesse. By\r\nthis means he said: “We would at least succeed in dividing the\r\nCanadians and in case of war we would have a certain number on\r\nour side who would stimulate the zeal of the national troops\r\nof the king. Besides, the nobles would have reason to hope\r\nthat their children without having received their education in\r\nFrance and without serving in the French service would be able\r\nto support their families in the service of the king, their\r\nmaster, in the exercise of offices which would prevent them\r\nfrom descending to the level of the common people through the\r\ndivision and the subdivision of their lands in each generation.”\r\n(Constitutional Documents, French Edit.)\r\n\r\nOn April 12, 1788, he again champions the noblesse and even\r\nrecommends that the ceremony of seigneurial feudalism be kept\r\nup as under the ancient régime. “All lands here,” he says,\r\n“are dependent on His Majesty’s Château of St. Louis and I am\r\npersuaded that nothing can be more agreeable to the people and\r\nmore suitable to secure the allegiance of the new subjects as\r\nwell as the payment of fines, dues and rights which take the\r\nplace of quit rents in this colony as a formal requisition,\r\nenjoining all who hold their lands directly from the king to\r\nrender him _foi et homage_ in his Château of St. Louis. The oaths\r\ntaken by the vassals on this occasion are very solemn and binding\r\nand involve serious obligations; they are obliged in consequence\r\nto produce what they call here their ‘aveux et dénombrement,’\r\ni. e., an exact return of their tenants and their revenue. In\r\naddition they have to pay their dues to their sovereign and\r\nto take arms to defend him in the case of an attack on the\r\nprovince.” (Constitutional Documents, French Edit.)\r\n\r\nA letter of Carleton to Lord Hillsborough of November 20, 1768,\r\nis headed “Secret Correspondence” (“Archives,” Series Q, Vol. V,\r\npage 890).[5] It shows that others besides Murray and Carleton\r\nhad been viewing with suspicion the actions of the noblesse\r\nwho were thought to be meditating a revolt. “My Lord,” writes\r\nCarleton, “since my arrival in this province I have not been\r\nable to make any discovery that induces me to give credit to\r\nthe paper of intelligence inclosed in Your Lordship’s letter of\r\nthe 20th of May, last, nor do I think it probable the chiefs of\r\ntheir own free notion in time of peace dare assemble in numbers,\r\nconsult and resolve on a revolt; that an assembly of military men\r\nshould be so ignorant as to fancy they could defend themselves\r\nby a few fire ships only against any future attack from Great\r\nBritain after their experience in fifty-nine. Notwithstanding\r\nthis and their decent and respectful obedience to the king’s\r\ngovernment hitherto, I have not the least doubt of their secret\r\nattachment to France and think this will continue as long as they\r\nare excluded from all employment under the British government\r\nand are certain of being reinstated at least in their former\r\ncommissions under that of France by which chiefly they supported\r\nthemselves and families. When I reflect that France naturally\r\nhas the affections of all the people, that to make no mention\r\nof fees of office and of the vexations of the law, we have done\r\nnothing to gain one man in the province by making it his private\r\ninterest to remain the king’s subject, and that the interests\r\nof many would be greatly promoted by a revolution, I own my not\r\nhaving discovered a treasonable correspondence never was proof\r\nsufficient to convince me that it did not exist in some degree,\r\nbut I am inclined to think if such a message had been sent, very\r\nfew were intrusted with the secret; perhaps the court of France\r\ninformed a year past by Mons. de Chatelet that the king proposed\r\nraising such a regiment of his new subjects caused this piece\r\nof intelligence to be communicated to create a jealousy of the\r\nCanadians and prevent a measure that might fix their attachments\r\nto the British government and probably of those savages who\r\nhave always acted with them; however that may be, on receiving\r\nthis news from France last spring, most of the gentlemen in the\r\nprovince applied to me and begged to be admitted to the king’s\r\nservice, assuring me that they would take every opportunity to\r\ntestify their zeal and gratitude for so great a mark of favour\r\nand tenderness, extended not only to them but to their posterity.”\r\n\r\nThe passage following is prophetic of the active interference\r\nwhich ten years later France was to take in the American war\r\nagainst Great Britain. “When I consider further that the king’s\r\ndominion here is maintained but by a few troops necessarily\r\ndispersed without a place of security for their magazines, for\r\ntheir arms or for themselves, amidst a numerous military people,\r\nthe gentlemen all officers of experience, poor, without hopes\r\nthat they or their descendants will be admitted into the service\r\nof their present sovereign, I can have no doubt but France as\r\nsoon as determined to begin a war will attempt to regain Canada,\r\nshould it be intended only to make a diversion while it may\r\nreasonably be undertaken with a little hazzard should it fail,\r\nand where so much may be gained should it succeed. But should\r\nFrance begin a war in hopes the British colonies will push\r\nmatters to extremities, and she adopts the project of supporting\r\nthem in their independent notions, Canada, probably, will then\r\nbecome the principal scene where the fate of America may be\r\ndetermined. Affairs in this situation, Canada in the hands\r\nof France would no longer present itself as an enemy to the\r\nBritish colony but as an ally, a friend and protector of their\r\nindependency.”\r\n\r\nThe sympathy, respect and even fear of the seigneurs which\r\nCarleton evinced in his reports home largely influenced the final\r\npassage of the Quebec act. Their firmness and persistency in\r\ntheir demand for their privileges and their influence over the\r\n_habitant_ and the possibility of their allegiance being tampered\r\nwith by France made them prevail over the small but active\r\nminority of the commercial class. At this time preparations\r\nwere being made in London for the settlement of the Quebec\r\ndifficulty. Secrecy was being observed in high quarters. Lord\r\nHillsborough’s answer, January 4, 1769, to Carleton’s last is\r\nalso secret, “acknowledging your secret dispatch of November\r\n21st before His Majesty. The remarks you make upon the state and\r\ntemper of His Majesty’s new subjects will be of great utility\r\nin the consideration of the measures now under deliberation\r\nand do evince both the propriety and necessity of extending to\r\nthat grave and faithful people a reaonable participation in\r\nthose establishments which are to form the basis of the future\r\ngovernment of Quebec.” He fears, however, although he agreed with\r\nCarleton’s recommendation, that prejudice being so strong it will\r\nbe difficult to admit them to military offices.\r\n\r\nThe following summary of investigations conducted for the\r\ngovernments at this time may now be added as evidence of the\r\nmilitary strength of the party Carleton wished to conciliate.\r\n\r\n  Noblesse in the Province of Quebec:\r\n\r\n      Captains having the order of St. Louis                             9\r\n      Captains named in the order but not invested                       1\r\n      Captains who have not the order                                    4\r\n      Lieutenants having the order                                       1\r\n      Lieutenants                                                       16\r\n      Ensigns                                                            2\r\n      Officers de Reserve                                                2\r\n      Cadets                                                            23\r\n      Have never been in the service                                    44\r\n      In the upper country who have never been in the service            6\r\n                                                                      ----\r\n        Total                                                          126\r\n  (At least eighty-five of these are reported as in the Montreal district.)\r\n\r\n  Noblesse in France:\r\n\r\n    Grand Croix                                                          1\r\n    Governors, lieutenant governors, majors, aide majors,\r\n      captains and lieutenants of ships of war, having the\r\n      order of St. Louis                                                26\r\n    Aide-majors and captains not having the order                        6\r\n    Lieutenants                                                         12\r\n    Ensigns                                                             19\r\n    Canadian officers in actual service whose parents have\r\n      remained in Canada                                                15\r\n                                                                      ----\r\n      Total                                                             79\r\n\r\n  Natives of France who came over to Canada as cadets, served and\r\n  were preferred in the colony troops and were treated in France as\r\n  Canadian officers:\r\n\r\n    Captains not having the Croix of St. Louis                           7\r\n    Had the rank of captain in 1760, raised to lieutenant in\r\n      France, Knight of St. Louis                                        1\r\n    Lieutenants                                                          7\r\n    Was captain in the colony troops at Mississippi, came to Canada\r\n      in 1760 and is raised to the rank of colonel in the Spanish\r\n      service at Mississippi; Knight of St. Louis                        1\r\n    Having had civil employment                                          5\r\n    Officers of the port                                                 2\r\n                                                                      ----\r\n      Total                                                             23\r\n\r\nThe case of the seigneurs and that of the merchants was by this\r\ntime well understood in England by the colonial authorities and\r\nthe parliament. The insistent demand for an assembly had been\r\nwell presented by Masères, while the no less repeated opposition\r\nto it in the form of an amended constitution to guarantee\r\nFrench-Canadian liberties had been equally well presented by the\r\nseigneurs and their upholders. It remained for legislators to\r\nsettle which was the more opportune, the delay of the assembly or\r\nthe immediate concessions of favours to the conquered race.\r\n\r\nThe session of 1774 was drawing to a close but the culminating\r\npoint looked to with such eagerness on both sides of the\r\nAtlantic, the Quebec act, was not introduced till May 17th, when\r\nit quickly passed the three readings in the house of lords. On\r\nthe 26th it reached the second reading in the commons when the\r\nserious opposition began. The debate was continued on June 6th,\r\n7th, 8th and 19th, on which latter day the bill was carried in\r\ncommittee by eighty-three to forty. On the third reading the\r\nfinal vote was fifty-six to twenty. The House of Lords received\r\nthe bill and its amendments for further consideration on June\r\n17th and the bill was passed on June 22d. The house was prorogued.\r\n\r\nThe Quebec Act restored the French civil law _in toto_. It\r\ndeclared that Roman Catholics were to enjoy the free exercise of\r\ntheir religion, though the clergy might only levy tithes on their\r\nown subjects. It amended the oath of allegiance so as to make it\r\npossible for an honest Roman Catholic to take it.\r\n\r\nThe act was in a sense a formal renunciation of the British\r\ngovernment to Anglicize the province of Quebec.[6] It was the\r\nlogical ratification of the British government’s promises to\r\nprotect the laws and institutions of the French-Canadians. It\r\nwas also a wise move. We know the views of Murray and Carleton.\r\nGeneral Haldimand, writing in 1780, six years after it had been\r\ntried, confirms this thus: “It requires little penetration to\r\ndiscover that had the system of government solicited by the old\r\nsubjects been adopted in Canada this colony would, in 1775, have\r\nbecome one of the United States of America.”\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[1] Mr. Gray was the first English notary of Montreal, being\r\nnamed such October 7, 1765; on August 15, 1768, he became an\r\nadvocate; on the 1st of May, 1776, he succeeded Mr. Turner as\r\nsheriff. In 1784 he accepted the position of sub-director of the\r\npost in the city.\r\n\r\n[2] The above names are not given with this fullness.

On the day of the prorogation\r\nof Parliament, June 22d, the mayor of London, attended by the\r\nrecorder, several aldermen and 150 of the common council, went to\r\nSt. James with a petition to the king to withhold his assent from\r\nthe bill. The lord chamberlain receiving them, told them that\r\nit was too late, that the king was then on the point of going\r\nto parliament to give his consent to a bill agreed on by both\r\nhouses of parliament and that they must not expect an answer.\r\nAmong other objections this petition claimed: “that the Roman\r\nCatholic religion which is known to be idolatrous and bloody\r\nis established by this bill and no legal provision is made for\r\nthe free exercise of our reformed faith nor the security of our\r\nProtestant fellow subjects of the church of England in the true\r\nworship of Almighty God according to their consciences.”\r\n\r\nIn the American colonies the Quebec act largely precipitated the\r\nAmerican Revolution then being concocted. Strong protest was\r\nmade, as for example, that shown by the delegates of Philadelphia\r\non September 5, 1774, in the address to the people of England;\r\n“By another act the Dominion of Canada is to be so extended,\r\nmodeled and governed as that by being disunited from us, detached\r\nfrom our interests by civil as well as by religious prejudices,\r\nthat by their numbers, swelling with Catholic emigrants from\r\nEurope, and by their devotion to administration so friendly\r\nto their religion, they might become formidable to us, and on\r\noccasion be fit instruments in the hands of power to reduce the\r\nancient free Protestant colonies to the same state of slavery as\r\nthemselves.” Again speaking of the Quebec Act, it adds “Nor can\r\nwe suppress our astonishment that a British parliament should\r\never consent to establish in that country a religion which has\r\ndeluged your Island in blood and dispersed impiety, bigotry,\r\npersecution, murder and rebellion through every part of the\r\nworld.” The Quebec act added fuel to the fire of discontent\r\nand the people were ready for war if the Congress said so. The\r\ncongress of Philadelphia at the same time published a long,\r\nbombastic and revolutionary address signed by Henry Middleton,\r\npresident.\r\n\r\n         “To the inhabitants of the province of Quebec.”\r\n\r\n  “We do not ask you to commence hostilities against the government\r\n  of our common sovereign but we submit it to your consideration\r\n  whether it may not be expedient to you to meet together in your\r\n  several towns and districts and elect deputies who after meeting\r\n  in a provincial congress may chose delegates to represent your\r\n  province in the continental congress to be held at Philadelphia\r\n  on the 10th of May, 1775.” An unanimous vote had been resolved\r\n  “That you should be invited to accede to our federation.” It is\r\n  interesting to note that, forgetful of the previous letter to the\r\n  British parliament breathing religious intolerance just referred\r\n  to, the artful Americans now used also the following _argumentum\r\n  ad hominem_: “We are too well acquainted with the liberality of\r\n  sentiment distinguishing your nation to imagine that difference\r\n  of religion will prejudice you against a hearty amity with us.\r\n  You know that the transcendent nature of freedom, elevates those\r\n  who unite in the cause above all such low-minded infirmities.”\r\n\r\nThis was printed for wide circulation in Canada and the question\r\nof sending the delegates was eagerly discussed in Montreal’s\r\naffected circles.\r\n\r\nThe Quebec act was one of the causes of grievance which led\r\nto the American Revolution; it was one of the acts of tyranny\r\nspecified in the Declaration of Independence, “For abolishing the\r\nfree system of English law in a neighbouring province (Canada),\r\nestablishing therein an arbitrary government and enlarging\r\nits boundaries so as to render it at once an example and fit\r\ninstrument for introducing the same absolute rules into these\r\ncolonies.”\r\n\r\nBut how was the bill received in Montreal? Truth to tell,\r\nMontreal was the seat of discontent in Canada. Its infection\r\nwas carried to Quebec. Sir Guy Carleton, who shortly after the\r\npassage of the Quebec bill left England with his young wife,[1]\r\nthe Lady Maria Howard, the third daughter of Thomas, the second\r\nEarl of Effingham, to resume his office as governor general,\r\ntells how the trouble started at Montreal in his letter to\r\nDartmouth, dated Quebec, 11th of November, 1774. We are there\r\ninformed that at Quebec there were addresses of loyal acceptation\r\nof the situation. “I believe,” wrote Carleton, “that most of\r\nthem who signed this address were disposed to act up to their\r\ndeclaration, which probably would have been followed by those\r\nwho did not, if their brethren at Montreal had not adopted very\r\ndifferent measures. Whether the minds of the latter are of a more\r\nturbulent turn or that they caught the fire from some colonists\r\nsettled among them, or in reality letters were received from\r\nthe general congress, as reported, I know not; certain it is,\r\nhowever, that shortly after the said congress had published in\r\nall the American papers their approbation of the Suffolk County\r\nResolves[2] in the Massachusetts Assembly, a report was spread\r\nat Montreal that letters of importance had been received from\r\nthe general congress and all the British there flocked to the\r\ncoffee house to hear the news. Grievances were publicly talked\r\nof and various ways for obtaining redress proposed, but that the\r\ngovernment might not come to a true knowledge of their intentions\r\na meeting was appointed at the house of a person then absent,\r\nfollowed by several others at the same place and a committee of\r\nfour named, consisting of Mr. Walker, Mr. Todd, Mr. Price and\r\nMr. Blake, to take care of their interests and prepare plans of\r\nredress. Mr. Walker now takes the lead. * * * Their plans being\r\nprepared and a subscription commenced, the committee set out for\r\nQuebec, attended in form by their secretary, a nephew of Mr.\r\nWalker and by profession a lawyer.”\r\n\r\nCarleton proceeds to describe how the Montreal emissaries worked\r\nup the Quebecers[3] through several “town meetings” to join\r\nin petitions, for a repeal of the Quebec act, which were sent\r\nto “His Majesty, to the Lords spiritual and temporal, to the\r\nHonourable, the Commons.” The chief grievances were that they\r\nhad lost the protection of the English laws and had thrust on\r\nthem the laws of Canada which are ruinous to their properties\r\nas thereby they lose the invaluable privilege of trial by\r\njuries; that in matters of a criminal nature the habeas corpus\r\nact is dissolved and they are subjected to arbitrary fines and\r\nimprisonment at the will of the governor and council. Masères was\r\nentrusted with the promotion of their cause. The petitions were\r\nsigned on November 12th. In February secret agents from congress\r\nwere in Montreal to see if an aggressive policy could be safely\r\npursued.\r\n\r\nThe majority of the English population was on the side of the\r\ndiscontented provinces. The French-Canadian _habitants_ were\r\nencouraged to remain neutral, being plied with specious arguments\r\nto undermine their loyalty to the king. They were told that\r\nthey had nothing to lose from the government by this position\r\nand everything to gain from the congress faction who threatened\r\nreprisals if they became actively opposed to them. But the\r\nnoblesse, the gentry and the clergy were against the congress,\r\nfor the Quebec act had guaranteed them the securities for the\r\nrights they most valued; they knew that there was little to hope\r\nfor from the Americans. The Quebec act came into operation on\r\nMay 1st and an instance of the unsettled state of men’s minds\r\nin Montreal is remembered by the incident of the desecration of\r\nthe king’s bust on this day. It was discovered daubed with black\r\nand decorated with a necklace of potatoes, and a cross attached\r\nwith the words “voila le pape du Canada et le sot Anglais.”[4]\r\nKingsford, following Sanguinet, says that the perpetrator of\r\nthe foolish insult, for such it was intended to be, was never\r\ndiscovered. The act was regarded as insolent and disloyal and it\r\ncaused great excitement. A public meeting was called at which 100\r\nguineas were subscribed to discover the perpetrators. The company\r\nof grenadiers of the Twenty-Six made a proclamation by beat of\r\ndrum offering a reward of $200 and a free pardon excepting the\r\nperson who had disfigured it to any one giving information which\r\nwould lead to the discovery of the offenders. The principal\r\nFrench-Canadians were greatly annoyed at this proceeding, the\r\nwords being in French. It was claimed, however, that they were\r\nwritten by an English speaking revolutionist.\r\n\r\nOn April 19th the affair at Lexington, the commencement of\r\na civil revolution, took place and rapidly the news of it\r\nspread. Montreal was well posted. The leaders of the provincial\r\nsympathizers here reported to the leaders of congress the easy\r\nfall of Canada to the insurgents. Canada was more feverishly\r\ncoveted at this time than ever. In 1712 Dummers had written:\r\n“I am sure it has been the cry of the whole country ever since\r\nCanada was delivered up to the French,--Canada est delenda.” In\r\n1756 Governor Livingston of New Jersey had cried: “Canada must\r\nbe demolished--Delenda est Carthago,--or we are undone.” And now\r\nCanada was desired as the “fourteenth colony.”\r\n\r\nIn Montreal those who had received in the coffee house\r\nJohn Brown, John Adams’ ambassador, were still keeping up\r\ncommunications led by Thomas Walker, Price and others. At last\r\nthe Congressists thought the conquest was being made, relying on\r\nthe presumed neutrality of the Canadians. Ticonderoga had fallen\r\nin the beginning of May to the revolutionary party under Ethan\r\nAllen’s self-constituted forces. The road to Canada was being\r\ncleared. Benedict Arnold, sailing from Ticonderoga, had arrived\r\nunexpectedly on the morning of the 18th of May at Fort St. John’s\r\nand captured the small war sloop there and took prisoners the\r\nsergeant and ten men in charge of the military garrison. A second\r\nlanding was made by Ethan Allen and his Green Mountain Boys at\r\nSt. John’s on the 18th and 19th with a party said to be three\r\nhundred strong, as Carleton was informed at Quebec. There was\r\ngreat consternation in Montreal when the news of the seizure of\r\nTiconderoga and Crown Point and the first capture of St. John’s\r\nwas brought by Moses Hazen,[5] a merchant of Montreal now living\r\nnear St. John’s. The military was immediately put in motion by\r\nColonel Templer who dispatched Colonel Preston with a regiment of\r\none hundred men of the Twenty-sixth and this would have cut off\r\nAllen’s descent up the lake with his bateaux had not Bindon, a\r\nfriendly Montreal merchant, hurried on horseback from Longueuil\r\nto St. John’s to apprize Allen of the approach of the party from\r\nMontreal.[6]\r\n\r\nAllen before embarking gave a letter to this same Bindon\r\naddressed to one Morrison and the British merchants at Montreal,\r\nlovers of liberty, demanding a supply of provisions, ammunition\r\nand spirituous liquors which some of them were inclined enough\r\nto furnish had they not been prevented. (Carleton to Dartmouth,\r\nJune 7, 1775, from Montreal.) Bindon in returning to Montreal\r\nfell across Colonel Preston who would have detained him but\r\nhe rode off and, crossing the St. Lawrence, found his way to\r\nMontreal with his letters. On arriving he added to the excitement\r\nof Montreal--it being market day--by reporting that Preston’s\r\ndetachment had been defeated. Colonel Templer called a meeting\r\nof the citizens for 3 o’clock at the Récollet church to consider\r\nthe situation. It was numerously attended and it was resolved to\r\ntake arms for the common defense. During the proceedings Templer\r\nreceived a letter from Preston detailing Bindon’s reprehensible\r\nconduct. Bindon was himself present and turned pale as the facts\r\nwere read. The meeting was adjourned until 10 o’clock next\r\nmorning when it was held on St. Anne’s common. Templer proposed\r\nthat the inhabitants should form themselves into companies of\r\nthirty and elect their officers. Several well known citizens were\r\nchosen to make the roll of those willing to serve.[7] They were\r\nof the old Canadian families known for their loyalty. Preston’s\r\ndetachment returned to Montreal, the men greatly infuriated\r\nagainst Bindon. They had learned that it was from no fault of his\r\nthey had not been intercepted in the woods and shot down. So soon\r\nas they were dismissed for parade they went in search of him.\r\nWhen he was found the men forcibly led him to the pillory with\r\nthe intention of hanging him, but they were without a ladder and\r\nthe officers rescued Bindon before one could be obtained. But he\r\nwas arrested and carried before the magistrates, when he pleaded\r\nguilty to imprudence but protested his innocence. To save his\r\ncharacter he played the part of a loyalist and took service in\r\nthe force organized for defense. The action of the troops with\r\nregard to Bindon was the occasion of a public meeting called by\r\nthe party for congress.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile a call for volunteers was met by an insignificant\r\nenrollment of fifty Canadians who set out for St. John’s\r\nunder Lieutenant McKay, to remain there until relieved by the\r\nTwenty-sixth regiment. Carleton moved the troops from Quebec\r\nthither, also. The few troops at Three Rivers were also sent;\r\nthe garrison of Montreal as well. Carleton arrived at Montreal\r\non May 26th. He found how poorly the French-Canadians had\r\nresponded to the call to organize themselves into companies. In\r\nSt. Lawrence suburb the commissioners sent to enroll volunteers\r\nhad been met by the women with threats of stoning. The loyalty\r\nof the French-Canadians had been sorely tampered with. There is\r\nnot a family resemblance between the letters written by Carleton\r\nabout the quality of their obedience, before the Quebec act and\r\nafter. On June 7, 1775, Carleton wrote from Montreal to Dartmouth\r\ngloomily reviewing the situation and telling of the preparations\r\nfor the safety of St. John’s. “The little force we have in the\r\nProvince was immediately set in Motion and ordered to assemble\r\nat or near St. John’s; the Noblesse of this Neighbourhood were\r\ncalled upon to collect their Inhabitants in order to defend\r\nthemselves. The Savages of these parts likewise had the same\r\norders but though the Gentlemen testified great Zeal, neither\r\ntheir Entreaties or their Example could prevail upon the People;\r\na few of the Gentry consisting principally of the Youth residing\r\nin this place and its Neighbourhood, formed a small Corps of\r\nVolunteers under the Command of Mr. Samuel McKay and took post\r\nat St. John’s; the Indians showed as much Backwardness as the\r\nCanadian Peasantry. * * * Within these few Days the Canadians and\r\nIndians seemed to return a little to their senses, the Gentry\r\nand Clergy had been very useful on this occasion and shewn great\r\nFidelity and Warmth for His Majesty’s Service, but both have\r\nlost much of their influence over the People. I proposed trying\r\nto form a Militia and if their minds are favourably disposed\r\nwill raise a Battalion upon the same plan as the other Corps in\r\nAmerica, as to Numbers and Experience, and were it established\r\nI think it might turn out a great public Utility; but I have my\r\ndoubts as to whether I shall be able to succeed.\r\n\r\n“These Measures that formerly would have been extremely popular\r\nrequire at present a great Degree of Caution and Circumspection;\r\nso much have the Minds of the People been tainted by the Cabals\r\nand Intrigues, I have from time to time given to your Lordship\r\nsome information of. I am as yet uncertain whether I shall\r\nfind it advisable to proceed in the forementioned Undertaking;\r\nto defame their King and treat with Insolence and Disrespect,\r\nupon all Occasions to speak with the utmost contempt of His\r\nGovernment, to forward Sedition and applaud Rebellion, seems\r\nto be what too many of his British-American Subjects in those\r\nparts think their undoubted Right.” (Constitutional Documents,\r\n1760-1791, page 450.)\r\n\r\nOn the 9th of June, Carleton, by proclamation, authorized\r\nthe calling out of the militia throughout the whole province\r\naccording to the provisions of the old law, reinstating\r\nofficers appointed by Murray, Gage and Burton. The movement was\r\nnot popular even with the new subjects, uninfluenced by the\r\ndiscontent of the disloyalists who feared in the return of the\r\nold militia the exactions of the French régime. Chief Justice\r\nHey, then in Montreal, prevailed upon some of the dissatisfied\r\n“old” but “loyal” subjects to enroll for good example, which\r\ndone, they were joined by the French-Canadians so that a\r\nsufficient force was ready for a review before General Carleton.\r\n\r\nThe Indians of Caughnawaga at first hesitated in their loyalty,\r\nwhich had also been tampered with, but they were also brought to\r\nserve. At this time Colonel Johnson arrived in Montreal with 300\r\nIndians of the six nations; a council of 600 Indians was held\r\nand all agreed to take the field in defense, but not to commence\r\nhostilities. The congressists had endeavoured to persuade them to\r\nneutrality and the leaven was still working.\r\n\r\nJuly was drawing to a close. Carleton left Montreal by way of\r\nLongueuil to inspect the militia at Sorel and then proceeded to\r\nQuebec, where he arrived on August 2d, to make preparations for\r\nthe establishment of the new Legislative Council. This met for\r\nthe first time on August 17th but it was adjourned on September\r\n7th on account of news of the congress troops again appearing\r\non the Richelieu. The lieutenant governor, Cramahé, writing to\r\nDartmouth from Quebec on September 21st, tells the circumstances\r\nhow on the news of the rebel army approaching, Carleton set out\r\nfor Montreal in great haste; that “on the 7th inst. the Rebels\r\nlanded in the woods near St. John’s and were beat back to their\r\nBoats by a Party of Savages encamped at that Place. In this\r\nAction the Savages behaved with great Spirit and Resolution and\r\nhad they remained firm to our Interests probably the Province\r\nwould have been Saved for this Year, but finding the Canadians\r\nin General adverse to taking up Arms for the Defence of their\r\nCountry, they withdrew and made their peace. After their Defeat\r\nthe Rebels returned to the Isle aux Noix, where they continued\r\ntill lately, sending out some Parties and many Emisaries to\r\ndebauch the Minds of the Canadians and Indians.”\r\n\r\nCramahé adds that no means had been left untried to bring the\r\nCanadian peasantry to a sense of their duty and to engage them\r\nto take up arms in defense of the province but to no purpose.\r\n“The Justice must be done to the Gentry, Clergy and most of the\r\nBurgeoisie that they have shewn the Greatest Zeal and Fidelity\r\nto the King’s Service and Exerted their best Endeavours to\r\nreclaim their infatuated Countrymen. Some Troops and a Ship of\r\nWar or two would, in all likelihood, have prevented this general\r\nDefection.”[8]\r\n\r\nChief Justice Hey, writing at the end of August to the Lord\r\nChancellor, says in a postscript dated September 11th “that\r\nall there was to trust to was about five hundred men, two war\r\nboats at St. John’s and Chambly; that the situation is desperate\r\nand that Canada would shortly be in complete possession of the\r\nrebels.” In a further postscript of September 17th he adds that\r\nnot one hundred Canadians, except in the towns of Quebec and\r\nMontreal, are with the king. He holds himself ready to return,\r\nto be of more use in England. Carleton, sick at heart with\r\ndisappointment at the ingratitude of the Canadians who would\r\nnot march to defend their own country, the uncertainty of the\r\nIndians, and the disloyalty of many of the old subjects, and\r\ncrippled by an inadequate army which was nearly all enclosed in\r\nForts Chambly and St. John’s, nevertheless determined to act\r\nboldly on the defensive until General Gage should send from\r\nBoston the two regiments earnestly asked for.\r\n\r\nCanada was abandoned at this period by as criminal apathy and\r\nignorance on the part of English officials, as it had been before\r\nby the French. As Cramahé had pointed out, some troops and a ship\r\nof war or two sent from England, or from Gage in America, would\r\nhave saved Canada from the invasion of 1775.\r\n\r\nThe part that Montreal took in the defence of Canada must now\r\nbe told. When the news of the rebels advancing on to St. John’s\r\nreached Montreal, Colonel Prescott, then in command, sent an\r\norder to the parishes around the city for fifteen men of each\r\ncompany of militia to join the force at St. John’s. Though no\r\nreport came from without, the Montreal army men came forward to\r\nthe number of 120 French and Canadians under the command of de\r\nBelestre and de Longueuil, many of the volunteers being young\r\nmen of family and several being prosperous merchants, this being\r\nperhaps the first recorded separate unit composed solely of\r\nFrench-Canadians, ever raised as an arm of Imperial defence. The\r\nparty for St. John’s departed on September 7th. The loyal British\r\nvolunteers remained to perform duty in Montreal. Time will\r\ndiscover who were truly loyal and who were not.\r\n\r\nThe Imperial forces in Canada were now represented by the two\r\ncompanies in Montreal, eighty-two men at Chambly and the garrison\r\nof St. John’s, consisting of 505 men of all rank, of the Seventh\r\nRoyal Fusiliers and the Twenty-sixth Regiment, thirty of the\r\nRoyal Artillery, eight of Colonel McLean’s newly raised corps\r\nfrom Quebec and fifteen of the Royal Horse and 120 volunteers\r\nfrom Montreal--the whole making a total of 696 in the garrison,\r\nnot counting some artificers.\r\n\r\nAround St. John’s and in the district of the Richelieu the\r\ninhabitants were either neutral or, with the majority, actively\r\nespousing the congress party, some by taking to the field, others\r\nby supplying provisions, assisting in the transport of munitions\r\nof war and artillery and giving information.\r\n\r\nSurely the _morale_ of the once loyal French-Canadian _habitants_\r\nhad been undermined effectively by Walker and other malcontents\r\nand had been recently further weakened by the manifesto of\r\nGeneral Schuyler from the Isle aux Noix on September 15th to his\r\n“dear friends and compatriots, the habitants of Canada,” advising\r\nthem to join him and escape the common slavery prepared for them.\r\nMontgomery’s scouting parties, out for supplies and information,\r\ndid the rest. Of Richard Montgomery, Schuyler’s second in\r\ncommand, we shall hear more.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              NOTE\r\n\r\n                           THE MILITIA\r\n\r\nThe militia, which was called out for service in the field in\r\n1775, 1776, 1812, 1814, 1837, 1839, with the exception of a few\r\nsmall independent corps, consisted of provisionally organized\r\nunits armed and equipped from the magazines, the regular army,\r\npaid by the British government, drilled, disciplined and often\r\ncommanded by regular officers. After the denudation of Canada\r\nof the regular troops at the time of the Crimean war, it became\r\nnecessary for the colony to take more provisions for its own\r\ndefence. In 1855 the military act (18 Victoria, Chapter 77),\r\npassed by the Upper Canada, for raising and maintaining at the\r\ncolonial expense, created the nucleus of our present militia\r\nsystem. The “Trent” excitement of 1861-62 and the Fenian raids\r\nof 1867-70 further stimulated the movement. The first Dominion\r\nmilitia act (31 Victoria, Chapter 40) was passed in 1868. The\r\npresent militia act (4 Edward VII, Chapter 23) received assent on\r\nAugust 15, 1904. According to this statute the militia is divided\r\ninto active and reserve forces.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[1] Carleton was then in his fiftieth year, his wife in her\r\ntwenty-second.

Ethan Allen, of Bennington, was, as\r\nCarleton had reported, “an outlaw in the province of New York,\r\nwho had become famous by his daring capture of Ticonderoga and\r\nhad been emboldened enough by his success to persuade the New\r\nYork congress to raise a small regiment of rangers.” Thus this\r\nfreebooter, with his Green Mountain Boys, became a commissioned\r\nofficer. He got employment under Schuyler and it was Ethan\r\nAllen with John Brown, now Major, who had formerly been sent to\r\nMontreal to sound the merchants, who bore Schuyler’s manifesto\r\nfrom Isle aux Noix to the habitants of Canada. From parish\r\nto parish he hurried and his ready wit and hustling address\r\ncaptivated the peasant housewives who, being educated better than\r\ntheir husbands, read the proclamation with approval to them.\r\nHe visited the Caughnawaga Indians and played havoc with their\r\nloyalty, receiving beads and wampum from them. His reappointment\r\nwas from Montgomery, then commencing the investment of St.\r\nJohn’s, who, it is said, wanting to find employment for Allen\r\nat a distance from himself, sent him to gather up a recruit of\r\nCanadians around Chambly. According to his own account he was\r\neasily successful. Writing to Montgomery on September 20th from\r\nSt. Ours, “You may rely on it,” he says, “that I shall join you\r\nin three days with five hundred or more Canadian volunteers.\r\n* * * Those that used to be enemies to our cause come cap in\r\nhand to me; and I swear by the Lord I can raise three times the\r\nnumber of our army provided you continue the siege.” Yet, on\r\nthe night of September 23d, when he found himself at Longueuil\r\nlooking across the St. Lawrence to the city which it was his\r\nambition to capture, he had only about eighty still following.\r\nHe was returning to St. John’s next morning, and when two miles\r\nfrom Longueuil he met John Brown, now Colonel in command of a\r\nconsiderable force at La Prairie. These two, retiring to a house\r\nwith some others, conceived the plan of attacking Montreal. The\r\nplan was for Brown with two hundred followers to cross over the\r\nSt. Lawrence in canoes above the town, and Allen’s party below\r\nit; each would silently approach the gate at his end of the city;\r\nBrown’s party would give three Huzzas! Allen’s would respond and\r\nthen both would fall to.\r\n\r\nIt was a brilliant idea and elated Allen. Montreal, captured by\r\na force of two to three thousand and the easy fall of the rest\r\nof Canada had been the vision put before congress often enough.\r\n“I still maintain my views,” says Colonel Easton before the\r\ncongress of Massachusetts on June 6, 1775, “that policy demands\r\nthat the colonies advance an army of two or three thousand men\r\ninto Canada and environ Montreal. This will inevitably fix and\r\nconfirm the Canadians and Indians in our interests.” On June 13,\r\n1775, Benedict Arnold wrote to congress, sketching out a plan by\r\nwhich with an army of 2,000 men, Chambly and St. John’s should\r\nbe cut off with 700 men, 300 more should guard the boats and\r\nthe line of retreat and a grand division of 1,000 should appear\r\nbefore Montreal, whose gates on the arrival of the Americans were\r\nto be opened by friends there “in consequence of a plan for that\r\npurpose already entered into by them.”\r\n\r\nOn May 29th Allen, over confident, had written to the Continental\r\nCongress: “Provided I had but 500 men with me at St. John’s when\r\nwe took the king’s sloop, I would have advanced to Montreal.” On\r\nJune 2d he wrote to the New York congress: “I will lay my life\r\non it that with 1,500 men and a proper train of artillery I will\r\ntake Montreal,” and on July 12th to Trumbull that if his Green\r\nMountain Boys had not been formed into a battalion under certain\r\nregulations and command he would further “advance then into\r\nCanada and invest Montreal.”\r\n\r\nHere, then, was Allen to attempt to take the city of his dreams\r\nwith a smaller force than his dreams provided for! He had\r\nforgotten, perhaps, that Carleton was in that city. He was elated\r\nthat he had added about thirty English Americans to his force,\r\nbut he was sorry that Thomas Walker had been communicated with\r\nat his home in L’Assomption. Night came on. Allen’s little fleet\r\nspent all the night being driven backward and forward by the\r\ncurrents, but at last after six crossings were made to land his\r\nmen in the limited number of available boats, on the morning of\r\nthe 25th the daring invaders were all landed at Longue Pointe.\r\nBut they heard no Huzza! from Brown’s party from the other side\r\nof the city. Brown had either known better or was jealous of\r\nEthan Allen’s desire to claim the capture of Montreal, as he had\r\ndone that of Ticonderoga.\r\n\r\nLongue Pointe was not unfriendly but thought discretion better\r\nthan valour. Allen saw himself in a foolish position; his\r\nslightness of force would soon be known in Montreal through the\r\nescape from his guards of a Montrealer named Desautel going out\r\nearly to his Longue Pointe farm.\r\n\r\nMontreal was in great excitement and confusion at the news of\r\nthe presence of the notorious New Hampshire incendiary. Even\r\nsome of the officers took to the ships.[1] It was, however, only\r\nat 9 o’clock that Carleton heard the news. There was a hurry\r\nand scurry and a beating of drums and the parade ground of the\r\nChamp de Mars behind the barracks was filled with the people.\r\nCarleton briefly told the citizens of their dangers and ordered\r\nthem to join the troops at the barracks. The instinct of\r\nself-preservation in a common danger made most obey except some,\r\nchiefly American colonists, that stepped forward and turned off\r\nthe contrary way.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: COLONEL ARNOLD]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GENERAL RICHARD MONTGOMERY]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HOUSE AT THE CORNER OF NOTRE DAME AND ST. PETER\r\nSTREETS Occupied by Montgomery and the American officers during\r\nthe winter of 1775-76.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HOUSE ON THE CORNER OF RUE BONSECOURS AND ST. PAUL\r\nSTREET Occupied by government representatives from 1775 to 1791.]\r\n\r\nAt last the Montreal party was ready. They dashed through the\r\nQuebec gate, smashing the boats there to cut off the enemies\r\nretreat, and hurried up north. The fight with Allen’s men began\r\nat 2 o’clock and lasted an hour and three-quarters by the\r\nwatch. Though carefully using all natural advantages of the\r\nground, ditches and coverts chosen beforehand, Allen himself was\r\ncompelled to surrender his sword to Peter Johnson, a natural\r\nson of Sir William, “providing I can be treated with honour,”\r\nhe added. The officers received him with politeness, like\r\ngentlemen. In the fight Allen lost twelve to fifteen men, killed\r\nand wounded; some had fled, but a body of forty prisoners were\r\nmarched to the city. The defenders had lost only six to eight of\r\ntheir men, so it was a famous victory. When the prisoners were\r\nbrought before Colonel Prescott in Barrack Yard an extraordinary\r\nincident occurred, according to “Allen’s Narrative.”\r\n\r\n“Are you the Colonel Allen who took Ticonderoga?” thundered\r\nout the British soldier. “The very man,” was the reply.\r\nPrescott angrily raised his cane to strike the roughly dressed,\r\ndust-stained ranger in a short deerskin coat, breeches of\r\nsagathy, and woolen cap. “You had better not strike me, I’m not\r\nused to it,” cried the aroused prisoner, shaking his fist at the\r\nangry commander of the garrison. Prescott then turned to the\r\nhabitant prisoners and ordered a sergeant to bayonet them. Allen\r\nthen stepped between his men and the soldiers and, tearing open\r\nhis clothes and exposing his shaggy bosom, exclaimed to Prescott:\r\n“I am the one to blame. Thrust your bayonets into my breast. I am\r\nthe sole cause of their taking up arms.” A long pause. Finally\r\nmuttered Prescott, “I will not execute you now, but you shall\r\ngrace a halter at Tyburn, ---- ye!” There was no suitable prison\r\nin Montreal so Allen was put into the hold of the Gaspé in the\r\nharbour to wait until he should be shipped to England for trial.\r\n\r\nMontreal was saved for the present; and Allen’s failure, as\r\nthe governor reported it, gave a favourable turn to the minds\r\nof the people and many began now to come back to loyalty. It\r\nseems strange, the impunity with which known plotters had been\r\nhitherto treated. Carleton would now make an example. He turned\r\nhis eyes sternly upon Thomas Walker. Already Mrs. Walker had been\r\ntold that her husband must quit the country. Now an order for\r\narrest on the charge of high treason was issued. Prescott handed\r\nthe warrant to Captain Bellair. On the night of the 5th-6th of\r\nOctober in their comfortable farm house at L’Assomption they were\r\nsurprised by a posse of twenty regulars and twelve Canadians.\r\nWalker, determined to resist, shot into the crowd, who fusilladed\r\nback. At last the four corners of the house were fired. As the\r\nhouse began to burn, the smoke within almost suffocated Mrs.\r\nWalker, so that he took her to a window and held her by the\r\nshoulders while she lowered herself in her nightdress as far as\r\nshe could, clinging to the windowsill. Finally she was rescued by\r\none of the soldiers setting a ladder to the wall. The floor that\r\nWalker was standing on was in flames, and on the promise of good\r\ntreatment from the soldiers, he surrendered. Their property was\r\nplundered and destroyed and the farm house wrecked. The Walkers\r\nwere given some wraps to cover their unfinished attire and were\r\nhurried to Prescott at Montreal. Charged with rebellion, Walker\r\nwas taken to the barracks and for thirty-three days and nights\r\nhe was confined in his solitary cell on a straw pallet under\r\na heavy load of irons. Then he was taken to Lisotte’s armed\r\nschooner and buried in the hold prison, to be taken for trial\r\nover seas. It was a terrifying example to all, a leading citizen,\r\na wealthy merchant, a Montreal magistrate and a felon! Truly a\r\nwarning to traitors.\r\n\r\nUsing this as a propitious moment Carleton issued another levy\r\nof men from the militia around Montreal. That October he was\r\nso encouraged that he assembled on St. Helen’s island, facing\r\nMontreal, seven or eight hundred men, counting Indians, and later\r\non the afternoon of October 30th pushed off, accompanied by Luc\r\nla Corne and Lorimier with thirty-five or forty boats for the\r\nshore of Longueuil to bear relief to the invested fort of St.\r\nJohn’s. Alan Maclean was to go from Quebec to meet Carleton at\r\nSt. John’s. But as they approached the harbour they were met with\r\nsuch havoc by a force under Seth Warner that had been making use\r\nof Longueuil Castle and who had a four-pounder emptying grape\r\nand a goodly backing of musketry at the landing, and quickly\r\nplaying upon the astonished flotilla, so that it turned around,\r\nbearing some forty or fifty dead and as many wounded. No American\r\nreceived a scratch.\r\n\r\nThe grand stroke had failed. Maclean’s force heard the bad\r\nnews and many began to desert. It was a game of battledore and\r\nshuttlecock for the French Canadian peasantry. It was not that\r\ntheir want of loyalty was to be blamed as the practical politics\r\nof the affair. It was a war of Englishmen again Englishmen, and\r\nthey were for the winners. The loss of Chambly was the turning\r\npoint in the siege of St. John’s which had been going on since\r\nSeptember 18th. Chambly had been surrendered by Major Stafford\r\nafter a siege of one day and a half, on October 17th, a sorry\r\nevent, for it was well supplied with winter provisions and\r\nammunition. The rebels, with the aid of others, were able for\r\nsix weeks to reinforce Montgomery at St. John’s, when he would\r\nhave been forced by the approach of winter to retire. Thus on the\r\nmorning of the 3d of November, at 10 o’clock, the surrender of\r\nSt. John’s was made by Colonel Preston to Montgomery.\r\n\r\nThe fall of Montreal was now assured and with winter approaching,\r\nMontgomery secured his position at Chambly, St. John’s and the\r\nRicheleau district. At Longueuil, Warren was posted with 300 men.\r\nThe complacent Indians at Caughnawaga willingly enough received\r\nan order to remain neutral. Everything was ready for the march on\r\nMontreal and Montgomery advanced to La Prairie, there collecting\r\nall the boats and bateaux available for the transportation of the\r\ntroops across the river to the city. On the 11th of November news\r\ncame to Carleton in Montreal that Montgomery was crossing over.\r\nIt was now his policy to leave. The capture was inevitable and\r\nhe had prepared for it since the fall of St. John’s. He spiked\r\nthe guns and burned the bateaux he could not use and caused the\r\nmunitions, provisions and baggage to be loaded on the three\r\narmed sloops. About one hundred and twenty regular troops were\r\nembarked on the vessels available. In the evening at 5 o’clock\r\nCarleton went aboard. Brigadier Prescott and the military and\r\nstaff accompanied. Eleven sail went down to Quebec. At Lavaltrie,\r\ntwelve miles west of Sorel, owing to contrary winds the flotilla\r\nwas detained during the 13th and 14th of November. On the 15th\r\na written summons came from Colonel Easton calling on Carleton\r\nto capitulate. On the night of the 16th and 17th of November\r\nCarleton went on the barge of Captain Bouchette and arrived at\r\nQuebec on Sunday, November 19th, escaping the batteries erected\r\nbeyond Sorel to intercept the fleet at Lavaltrie.\r\n\r\nOn the same day this fleet was visited by Major Brown with\r\na peremptory order to surrender. Prescott saw no way out of\r\nit; he first threw the powder into the St. Lawrence and then\r\nsurrendered. The congress troops now took charge of the fleet and\r\nwith a favourable north wind convoyed the army and fleet back to\r\nMontreal. Walker, a prisoner in irons in the hold, was released\r\nas soon as possible. The fleet arrived on November 22d. The\r\nprisoners were ordered by Montgomery to parade on the river front\r\nthe following morning before the market and then lay down their\r\narms.\r\n\r\nWe must go back to the 11th of November and visit defenseless\r\nMontreal. The loyalists were sad, as having been at a funeral,\r\nin the passing away of its defenders. The discontented, now that\r\nMontreal was on the point of changing hands, openly abandoned\r\ntheir arms and threw off their disguise. That night Montgomery’s\r\nforce encamped on St. Paul’s Island. On Sunday morning, about\r\n9 o’clock, when many were going to church, news arrived that\r\nMontgomery was coming from the island to Point St. Charles and\r\na committee of twelve citizens was appointed to go to meet him.\r\nMeanwhile he had arrived and the inhabitants of the suburbs\r\nwest of the city had assured him of their neutrality. He had\r\nalso received encouraging messages from the disaffected within\r\nthe city, for Bindon, now a sentry at one of the embrasures,\r\ntraitorously allowed a partner of Price, whom we have mentioned\r\nas in league with the Boston party, and another, to communicate\r\nwith the congress party now advancing. Montgomery must have\r\nlearnt that there was a strong following in the city prepared\r\nto side with him and that those opposed to him were handicapped\r\nfor want of ammunition and provision. It was reliance on these\r\nelements within and without the city, with the knowledge that few\r\nwere willing to take up arms against him, that made it possible\r\nfor Montgomery with his slight force to capture a city of 1,200\r\ninhabitants.\r\n\r\nThe deputation meeting him was told that he gave them four\r\nhours to consider the terms on which they would accede to his\r\nauthority. Being told that he must not approach nearer the\r\ncity, he answered that it was somewhat cold weather and he\r\nimmediately sent fifty men to occupy the Récollet suburb, and\r\nbefore 4 o’clock his whole force was established there. This made\r\nan uproar in the town and the loyalists were for shooting on\r\nthem. The articles of capitulation were prepared and presented\r\nto Montgomery. “I will examine them and reply soon,” said he.\r\nThey demanded that “The religious orders should enjoy their\r\nrights and properties, that both the French and English should\r\nbe maintained in the free exercise of their religion, that trade\r\nin the interior and upper part of the provinces and beyond the\r\nseas should be uninterrupted, that passports on legitimate\r\nbusiness should be granted, that the citizens and inhabitants\r\nof Montreal should not be called upon to bear arms against the\r\nmother country, that the inhabitants of Montreal and of every\r\npart of the province, who have borne arms for the defense of the\r\nprovince then prisoners, should be released, that the courts of\r\njustice should be reestablished and the judges elected by the\r\npeople, that the inhabitants of the city should not be forced to\r\nreceive the troops, that no habitant of the country parishes and\r\nno Indians should be admitted into the city until the commandant\r\nhad taken possession of it and made provision for its safety.”\r\n\r\nThe general in reply stated first, “that owing to the city\r\nof Montreal having neither ammunition, adequate artillery,\r\ntroops nor provisions and not having it in its power to\r\nfulfill one article of the treaty, it could claim no title\r\nto its capitulation, yet the continental army had a generous\r\ndisdain of every act of oppression and violence; they are come\r\nfor the express purpose of giving liberty and security.”[2]\r\nHe accepted most of the provisions laid down. But from the\r\nunhappy differences of Great Britain and the colonies he was\r\nunable to engage that trade should be continued with the mother\r\ncountry. In acceding to the demands he made it understood that\r\nthe engagements entered upon by him would be binding on his\r\nsuccessors.\r\n\r\nNext day, the 13th of November, the congress troops, many of\r\nwhom wore the scarlet uniforms of the British troops found in\r\nthe military stores at St. John’s and Chambly, entered by the\r\nRecollet gate (at the corner of McGill and Notre Dame streets)\r\nand, receiving the keys to the storehouses of the city, marched\r\nproudly along Notre Dame Street to the barracks opposite what is\r\nnow known as Jacques Cartier Square.\r\n\r\nThe capture of Montreal was quickly made known in the American\r\nprovince. “Dispatches for His Excellency, General Washington;\r\nnews of Montreal’s quiet submission of that city to the\r\nvictorious arms of the United Colonies of America” was soon\r\nannounced in the New England Chronicle.\r\n\r\nMontgomery remained in Montreal until November 28th. News came of\r\nthe success of the detachment placed at Sorel. For, on the 22d,\r\nas already stated, the eleven vessels captured by Colonel Easton\r\nat Lavaltrie were brought into Montreal with Colonel Prescott and\r\nthe military prisoners and the released Thomas Walker. One reason\r\nfor Montgomery’s delay was due to the expectancy of the arrival\r\nof the detachments he had ordered. He now left General David\r\nWooster in command of the detachment kept behind in the city\r\nand went down the river to join Benedict Arnold, who had been\r\nunsuccessful in his attack on Quebec, and to take command of the\r\nbesieging forces. For unless Quebec were taken, Canada could not\r\nbe said to have been subdued.\r\n\r\nWooster’s first action was to disseminate Washington’s proclamation\r\nconfided to Arnold for the inhabitants of Canada. It started\r\n“Friends and Brethren.” The second paragraph runs thus: “Above all\r\nwe rejoice that our enemies have been deceived with regard to you.\r\nThey have persuaded themselves, they have even dared to say, that\r\nthe Canadians were not capable of distinguishing between the\r\nblessings of liberty and the wretchedness of slavery; that\r\ngratifying the vanity of a little circle of nobility would blind\r\nthe people of Canada. By such artifices they hoped to bind you to\r\ntheir views, but they have been deceived; they see with a chagrin\r\nequal to our joy that you are enlightened, generous and virtuous;\r\nthat you will not renounce your own rights or serve as instruments\r\nto deprive your fellow subjects of theirs. Come then, my brethren,\r\nunite with us in an undissoluble union, let us run together to the\r\nsame goal. We have taken up arms in defence of our liberty, our\r\nproperty, our wives and our children; we are determined to preserve\r\nthem or die. We look forward with pleasure to that date not far\r\nremote, we hope, when the inhabitants of America shall have one\r\nsentiment and the full enjoyment of a free government.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ENDORSEMENT ON SAMUEL ADAMS’ LETTER OF FEBRUARY\r\n21, 1775]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FROM LETTER OF APRIL 8, 1775, TO ADAMS AND HIS\r\nASSOCIATES]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SAMUEL ADAMS]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GEORGE WASHINGTON]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FROM SCHUYLER’S LETTER TO WASHINGTON]\r\n\r\nThe reference to the little circle of noblesse blinding the\r\npeople of Canada shows the line of argument which had been\r\nmaking the people, until lately so happy, now so discontented\r\nand disloyal. Will any impartial student of Canada under the\r\nFrench régime say that the Bostonians’ insinuation of oppression\r\nas being the habitual lot of the French Canadian peasants, was\r\nfounded on fact? They had succeeded so far in unsettling for\r\na time a people newly enfranchised with powers hitherto not\r\nentrusted to them, but the reaction will follow and the argument\r\nof slavery and oppression will fall on deaf ears. To the credit\r\nof the clergy, seigneurs and professional classes of this period\r\nbe it said that they saved Canada.\r\n\r\nIf the French habitant was weak in 1775, watching which way to\r\njump, he will be strong in 1812 and 1813 and the victory of\r\nChateauguay, though but a “bush fight,” will serve to consolidate\r\nthe British rule in Canada. It has been noticed that the French\r\nCanadian loyalty is of the “head” rather than of the “heart.”\r\nBut the analogy between French Canadians and Scotchmen has also\r\nbeen pointed out. The latter point with pride to Bannockburn as\r\nwell as to Waterloo. They, with the help of time, have a hearty\r\naffection for the Empire. So it is with the French Canadians in a\r\nmore and more growing manner.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[1] There must have been a miscellaneous collection of canoes,\r\nand one or two bateaux.\r\n\r\n[2] A transcript lately issued by the Canadian Antiquarian and\r\nNumismatic Society of Montreal, of the expense book of the\r\ncommissary under Arnold which has entries from February to May,\r\n1776, goes to show that, to give the invader his due, large sums\r\nof money were disbursed for beef and other supplies. During the\r\nwar bread was very dear and wheat was scarce. A brown loaf cost\r\nthirty _sols_ or 1 s. and 3 d. a pound; white, 25 _sols_, or 1 s.\r\n½ d. a pound.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                           CHAPTER IX\r\n\r\n     MONTREAL, AN AMERICAN CITY SEVEN MONTHS UNDER CONGRESS\r\n\r\n                              1776\r\n\r\n              THE CONGRESS ARMY EVACUATES MONTREAL\r\n\r\n  MONTREAL UNDER CONGRESS--GENERAL WOOSTER’S TROUBLES--MONEY AND\r\n    PROVISIONS SCARCE--MILITARY RULE--GENERAL CONFUSION--THE\r\n    CHATEAU DE RAMEZAY, AMERICAN HEADQUARTERS--THE COMMISSIONERS:\r\n    BENJAMIN FRANKLIN, SAMUEL CHASE AND CHARLES CARROL--FLEURY\r\n    MESPLET, THE PRINTER--THE FAILURE OF THE COMMISSIONERS--NEWS\r\n    OF THE FLIGHT FROM QUEBEC--MONTREAL A STORMY SEA--THE\r\n    COMMISSIONERS FLY--THE WALKERS ALSO--THE EVACUATION BY THE\r\n    CONGRESS TROOPS--NOTES: I. PRINCIPAL REBELS WHO FLED; II.\r\n    DESCRIPTION OF DRESS OF AMERICAN RIFLES.\r\n\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the efforts of Montgomery and Arnold with a force\r\nof about one thousand, five hundred men, among whom were the\r\nCanadians under Major Duggin, formerly a Quebec barber, were\r\nengaged in besieging Quebec, a more difficult task than they\r\nexpected. On the last day of 1775 Montgomery met his death.\r\nArnold was wounded in the foot and many of the congress soldiers\r\nhad caught the smallpox. Still the siege went on, although under\r\ngreat depression. The death of Montgomery had placed General\r\nWooster in command of the province till the appointment of\r\nGeneral Charles Lee in February. “For God’s sake,” wrote Arnold\r\nto Wooster at Montreal on December 31st, “order as many men as\r\nyou can possibly spare consistent with the safety of Montreal.”\r\n\r\nBut Wooster had his own troubles. The Canadians around him could\r\nnot be relied on. Besides he had no cash. Price, of Montreal,\r\nwho had enticed the Americans over, had enabled them to subsist\r\nas an army, having already advanced about £20,000; but now he\r\nwas “almost out of that article himself,” and could find no one\r\nin the city willing to lend. (Price to General Schuyler, January\r\n5th.) Wooster, therefore, looked upon Montreal as the place to be\r\nreserved for a retreat. “I shall not be able to spare any men to\r\nreinforce Colonel Arnold,” he wrote to Schuyler on January 5th.\r\n“What they will do at Quebec for want of money God only knows,\r\nbut none can be spared from Montreal.” Yet in the last week of\r\nJanuary Wooster had been enabled to send about one hundred and\r\ntwenty from Montreal.\r\n\r\nDuring February Wooster’s letters from Montreal were gloomy:\r\n“Our flour is nearly expended, we have not more than enough for\r\nthe army for one week; we can purchase no provisions or wood\r\nor pay for the transporting of anything without hard cash. Our\r\ncredit sinks daily. All the provisions and wood that we want for\r\nthe army for two or three weeks to come must be purchased and\r\ntransported to camp by the middle of March. There will be no\r\npassing for a month or six weeks; these things must be provided\r\nimmediately, or the consequences will be dreadful.”\r\n\r\nIn Montreal, Wooster found other trouble. The clergy were in\r\nfavour of the British régime. On January 6th, writing to Warner,\r\nthe commandant wrote: “The clergy refuse absolution to all who\r\nhave shown themselves our friends and preach damnation to all\r\nthose who will not take up arms against us.” Then there was\r\nnothing but paper money, which had little value, seeing that\r\nit might never be redeemed. At Quebec and Montreal men were\r\nforced to serve congress, even when legally freed. Quarrels\r\nbetween the military authorities such as that between Schuyler\r\nand Wooster were not edifying to the Canadians, used to harmony\r\nin government. A mutiny arose among the soldiers who refused to\r\ngo to serve at Quebec. Six ring leaders were flogged. On the\r\n14th of January an ordinance of General Wooster appeared at the\r\nchurch doors forbidding anyone speaking against congress under\r\npenalty of being sent out of the province. It is to be owned\r\nthat orders were given for the soldiers to live peacefully and\r\nhonestly with their Canadian brethren, but in spite of this,\r\nthere were many individual abuses, at least. The people began to\r\nfeel that the strangers who came to them as suppliants to succour\r\nthem, ruled them with military law at times despotic. General\r\nLee gave an order to General Wooster which made the Montreal\r\nmerchants consider their trade injured; he was told “to suffer\r\nthe merchants of Montreal not to send any of their woolen cloths\r\nout of the town.”\r\n\r\nThe loyalists were named _tories_ and Wooster became convinced\r\n“of the great necessity of sending many of their leaders out\r\nof the province,” and he would have sent Hertel de Rouville,\r\nthe Sulpician Montgolfier, and many others out of the way, and\r\nit is said no less than forty sleds of indignant tories made\r\nthe journey to Albany.[1] Carleton, be it remembered, took a\r\nlong time before he requested Walker to leave the country. When\r\nexpostulated with by a number of citizens Wooster answered: “I\r\nregard the whole of you as enemies and rascals.” He was unwise\r\nenough to have the churches shut up on Christmas eve. Altogether\r\nthe reports, sent to Schuyler and others, indicated that there\r\nwas great confusion in Montreal and Canada. Soon it began to\r\nappear as if nothing but terror was keeping the Canadians. A\r\nplot was laid as early as January to overcome the garrison of\r\nMontreal.[2] Secretly many were combining under the royal flag.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FROM THE COMMISSIONERS’ LETTER TO CONGRESS, MAY 1,\r\n1776]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FROM THOMAS WALKER’S LETTER TO ADAMS, MAY 30, 1776]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: POSTSCRIPT OF ARNOLD’S LETTER TO CLINTON, MAY 12,\r\n1776]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FROM CARLETON’S LETTER TO GERMAIN, MAY 25, 1776]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FROM MONTGOMERY’S LETTER TO MONTREAL, NOVEMBER 12,\r\n1775]\r\n\r\nMeanwhile at Quebec, Carleton pursued Fabian tactics and would\r\nnot venture out into the open. He had seen this mistake made\r\nby Wolfe, and he had not been his quarter-master-general for\r\nnothing, so he waited for the ships from England to come, as\r\nindeed they did, at last, on May 6th, the Surprise leading,\r\nfollowed by the Isis and the Martin. The flight of the Americans\r\nto Montreal soon began.\r\n\r\nAt Montreal exciting circumstances had occurred at the American\r\nheadquarters, the Château de Ramezay, which had been that of\r\nGage, Burton and other British commandants since it had ceased\r\nbeing the seat of the East India Fur Company under the French\r\nregime.\r\n\r\nOn April 26th its doors had opened to General John Thomas on\r\nhis arrival to take command of the army before Quebec, and\r\nits council chamber had been the scene of hasty conference\r\nwith Arnold and other gentlemen. It was now to receive the\r\ncommissioners from congress, long asked for by Montgomery and\r\nSchuyler, but only named and appointed on the 15th of February\r\nby the resolution “that a committee of three (two of whom to be\r\nmembers of congress) to be appointed to proceed to Canada, there\r\nto pursue such instructions as shall be given them by congress.”\r\nThe instructions given later directed the commissioners to\r\nrepresent to the Canadians in the strongest terms that it was\r\nthe earnest desire of congress to adopt them as a side colony\r\nunder the protection of the Union and to urge them to take a part\r\nin the contest then on, that the people should be guaranteed\r\n“the free and undisturbed exercise of their religion,” that the\r\nclergy should have the full, perfect and peaceable possession\r\nand enjoyment of all their estates and the entire ecclesiastical\r\nadministration beyond an assurance of full religious liberty\r\nand civil privileges to every sect of Christians should be\r\nleft in the hands of the good people of that province and such\r\nlegislature as they should constitute. The commissioners started\r\nfrom New York on April 2d. They were men of mark--the great\r\nBenjamin Franklin, Samuel Chase of Maryland, and Charles Carroll,\r\nof Carrollton, described by John Adams as a “gentleman of\r\nindependent fortune, perhaps the largest in America, one hundred\r\nand fifty or two hundred thousand pounds sterling, educated in\r\nsome university in France, though a native of America, of great\r\nabilities and learning, complete master of the French language,\r\na professor of the Roman Catholic religion, yet a warm, a firm,\r\na zealous supporter of the rights of America in whose cause he\r\nhas hazarded his all.” With the commissioners was adjoined John\r\nCarroll, the brother of Charles. He was a clever ecclesiastic,\r\nbecome through the suppression of the Society of Jesus, an\r\nex-Jesuit who was afterwards to become the first archbishop\r\nof Baltimore. Much reliance was placed on his intermediary\r\novertures to the Canadian clergy. On their arrival at St. John’s\r\nthe commissioners felt their first check. They had carried no\r\nhard cash with them. They were brought up at once against the\r\nfundamental difficulty. In their letter to congress on May 1st\r\nthe commissioners wrote, “It is impossible to give you a just\r\nidea of the lowness of continental credit here from the want\r\nof hard money and the prejudice it is to our affairs. Not the\r\nmost trifling service can be purchased without an appearance\r\nof instant pay in silver or gold. The express we sent from St.\r\nJohn’s to inform the general of our arrival there and to request\r\ncarriages for La Prairie, had to wait at the ferry till a friend,\r\npassing, changed a dollar for us into silver.” This friend, a\r\nMr. McCartney, had also to pay for the calèches for La Prairie or\r\nthey would have had to remain stranded.\r\n\r\nThey reached Montreal on April 27th and were received by Arnold\r\nwith some ostentation at the Château, where guests among the\r\nFrench ladies were invited to meet them. That night after supper\r\nthe commissioners lodged in Thomas Walker’s house.\r\n\r\nWalker’s house was that originally built by Bécancourt, which\r\nbecame the depôt of the Compagnie des Indes. It passed finally\r\ninto the McGill family. It stood immediately west of the Château\r\nde Ramezay. It was demolished in 1903.\r\n\r\nWith the commissioners there came about the same time the French\r\nprinter, Fleury Mesplet. He was brought, along with his printing\r\npress, to spread campaign literature for the congress. His press\r\nwas soon installed in the basement of the Château. It had been\r\nhis press in Philadelphia from which the original proclamation\r\nof 1775 to the Canadians originated. He became the first printer\r\nof Montreal. The first book published by him is supposed to be\r\n“Réglement de la Confrèrie de l’Adoration Perpetuelle du Saint\r\nSacrément et de la Bonne Mort, chez F. Mesplet et C. Berger,\r\n1776.”[3] Another book bearing the same date, 1776, and published\r\nby Mesplet at Montreal, is “Jonathan et David, ou le Triomphe de\r\nL’Amitié,” tragedie en trois actes, representèe par les ecoliers\r\nde Montréal, a Montréal chez Fleury Mesplet et C. Berger,\r\nImprimeurs et Libraires, 1776.\r\n\r\nJohn Carroll early began to get in touch with the clergy, but he\r\nfound an impenetrable barrier--the clergy had nothing to gain\r\nby swerving from their allegiance to England. What more than\r\nthe Quebec act could the provincials give them? They feared\r\nthe intolerance of the Americans. Had they not seen Wooster’s\r\nconduct? They were now offering religious freedom, but the clergy\r\ncould not forget the letter addressed by congress to the British\r\npeople in 1774, after the Quebec act, containing this significant\r\nsentence: “Nor can we suppress our astonishment that a British\r\nparliament should ever consent to establish in that country a\r\nreligion that has deluged your island in blood and dispersed\r\nimpiety, bigotry, persecution, murder and rebellion through every\r\npart of the world.”\r\n\r\nThe political arguments of the commissioners were of no avail,\r\neither. The great Continental Congress was there before their\r\neyes, and the great Continental Congress was bankrupt. The paper\r\nmoney was discredited. Not all Charles Carrol’s wealth was of\r\navail, unless it were in hard cash. An urgent request was sent to\r\nPhiladelphia to send £20,000 in specie. Only one-twelfth of this\r\ncould be promised.\r\n\r\nThere were other grievances, but most were from the non-payment\r\nof money lent or furnished for supplies. On the commissioners\r\nfell the superintendence of the army. This was no easy task, as\r\nprovisions were giving out. Smallpox was breaking out among the\r\nsoldiers. The commissioners were not trained to rule the army\r\nand in the confused state of affairs they recognized the failure\r\nof their mission. In their letter of May 17th to congress they\r\nsaid: “The possession of this country must finally be settled\r\nby the sword. We think our stay here no longer of service to the\r\npublick * * * and we await with impatience the further orders of\r\nthe congress.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FROM FRANKLIN’S LETTER TO CHASE AND CARROLL]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FROM CHASE AND CARROLL’S LETTER TO THOMAS]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: JOHN CARROLL]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FRANKLIN MEMORIAL TABLET (ENGLAND)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CHARLES CARROLL]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LETTER FROM CHASE AND CARROLL TO GENERAL WOOSTER]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CARROLL’S REPORT ON MRS. WALKER’S CONDUCT]\r\n\r\nThe commissioners in their first report from Montreal blamed\r\nWooster and declared him totally unfit for his command; the state\r\nof Canada was desperate; everything was in confusion, there was\r\nno discipline, the army unpaid, credit exhausted. “Such is our\r\nextreme want of flour that we were obliged yesterday to seize\r\nby force sixteen barrels to supply the garrison with bread. We\r\ncannot find words to describe our miserable condition.”\r\n\r\nTo crown the difficulty of the commissioners, the news of the\r\nQuebec disaster and flight reached their ears on the 9th of May.\r\n“Every military plan and hope staggered under the shock. Montreal\r\nbecame a stormy sea.” Dreading that one of the British frigates,\r\nwhich were ascending the river but with an unfavourable wind,\r\nwould run up and cut them off, the commissioners began to prepare\r\nto leave the city.\r\n\r\nThe state of Montreal after the news of Quebec, is well described\r\nby Justin H. Smith in “Our Fight for the Fourteenth Colony,”\r\n(Vol. II, page 374): “Montreal is listening eagerly for his drum\r\n(Captain Young’s of St. Anne’s Fort).” Hazen had declared a month\r\nbefore, “There is nothing but plotting and preparations making\r\nagainst us throughout the whole district.” When it was proposed\r\nto abandon the town after the news of the flight from Quebec\r\narrived, Arnold feared the people would attack his departing\r\ntroops. On all sides the tories whom Ripley had found very plenty\r\nin March but mostly living like woodchucks underground, were now\r\nshowing noses and even feet. The commissioners, getting daily\r\nintimations of plots hatching and insurrections intended, had\r\nabandoned perforce the rôle of dispensing pure liberty, filled\r\nthe jails with malcontents and sent others into the exile they\r\nhad lately protested against, but these measures did not reach\r\nthe seat of the trouble. Night after night a rising was talked of\r\nand expected; Lieutenant Colonel Vose would go round the barrack,\r\nwaken the men coming down with smallpox and make them dress\r\nthemselves and load their guns. “If they do take us it shall not\r\nbe for nothing,” he quietly said.\r\n\r\nOn the morning of May 17th Benjamin Franklin left, accompanied by\r\nMrs. Walker and Mrs. Price.[4] Next day he was joined by Father\r\nCarroll and the party ascended Lake Champlain for New York.\r\nWalker joined them later and both were left at Albany, “civilly\r\nbut coldly.” So he passes out of the history of Montreal.\r\n\r\nThe other commissioners, Carroll and Chase, left Montreal on May\r\n29th for Chambly for a council of war; on the 31st they left St.\r\nJohn’s; on the 2d of June they left for Crown Point, a distance\r\nof 106 miles. Thus ended their unsuccessful mission.\r\n\r\nHow finally the congress troops were driven out of the country,\r\nhow the additional reinforcements arrived at Quebec on June 1st\r\nunder Burgoyne, is Canadian history beyond that of Montreal.\r\nSuffice it to say that by June 17th things had become so hot in\r\nMontreal for Arnold who saw that the junction of the Canadas with\r\nthe colonies was now at an end, that the evacuation commenced on\r\nthis day. In two hours, the sick, the baggage and the garrison,\r\nreduced by this time to 300 men, embarked on eleven bateaux and\r\nin two hours more a procession of carts, escorted by the troops,\r\nset out from Longueuil for La Prairie.[5]\r\n\r\nWilkinson, who was Arnold’s aide-de-camp in Montreal, has placed\r\nit on record “that among the property on the bateaux was the\r\nmerchandise obtained by Arnold in Montreal. It was transferred\r\nto Albany and sold for Arnold’s benefit.” “This transaction is\r\nnotorious,” says Wilkinson (Volume I, page 58), “and excited\r\ndiscontent and clamour in the army; yet it produced no regular\r\ninquiry, although it hurt him in the esteem of every man of\r\nhonour and determined me to leave his family on the first proper\r\noccasion.”\r\n\r\n\r\n                             NOTE I\r\n\r\n                    PRINCIPAL REBELS WHO FLED\r\n\r\nThat those of the French Canadians of the better class who sided\r\nwith the Bostonians were very few is evinced by a list sent by\r\nCarleton to Lord George Germain on May 9, 1777. There is only one\r\nFrench name mentioned and that is Pelissier, of Three Rivers,\r\nwho was a Frenchman from France. The list is referred to in\r\na postscript by Carleton as follows: “Enclosed your Lordship\r\nwill receive a list of principal leaders of sedition here. We\r\nhave still too many remaining amongst us that have the same\r\ninclination, though they at present act with more caution and so\r\nmuch subtlety as to avoid the punishment they justly deserve.”\r\nThe enclosure is headed “List of the principal persons settled in\r\nthe province who very zealously served the rebels in the winter\r\nof 1775-1776 and fled upon their leaving it, the place they were\r\nsettled at, and the country are natives of as England, Scotland,\r\nIreland, America or France.”\r\n\r\nAt Quebec two Englishmen, two Scotchmen and seven Americans are\r\nnamed.

His underdress, by\r\nno means in a military style, was covered by a deep ash-coloured\r\nhunting shirt,--leggings and moccasins, if the latter could be\r\nprocured. It was a silly fashion of those times for riflemen\r\nto ape the manners of the savages. The Canadians who first\r\nsaw these (men) emerge from the woods said they were vêtus en\r\ntoile--‘clothed in linen.’ The word ‘toile’ was changed to\r\n‘tôle,’ iron plated. By a mistake of a single word the fears of\r\nthe people were greatly increased, for the news spread that the\r\nmysterious army that descended from the wilderness was clad in\r\nsheet-iron.\r\n\r\n“The flag used by what was called the Continental troops, of\r\nwhich the force led into Canada by Arnold and Montgomery was a\r\npart, was of plain crimson, and perhaps sometimes it may have\r\nhad a border of black. On the 1st of January, 1776, the army was\r\norganized and the new flag then adopted was first unfurled at\r\nCambridge at the headquarters of General Washington, the present\r\nresidence of the poet Longfellow.\r\n\r\n“That flag was made up of thirteen stripes, seven red and six\r\nwhite, but the Union was the Union of the British flag of that\r\nday, blue bearing the Cross of St. Andrew combined with the Cross\r\nof St. George and a diagonal red cross for Ireland. This design\r\nwas used by the American army till after the 14th of June, 1777,\r\nwhen Congress ordered that the Union should be changed, the Union\r\nof the English flag removed and in its place there should be a\r\nsimple blue field with thirteen white stars, representing the\r\nthirteen colonies declared to be states.\r\n\r\n“Since then there has been no change in the flag, except that a\r\nstar is added as each new state is admitted.”\r\n\r\n                                              W.C. HOWELLS.[6]\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[1] Among those banished by Wooster was St. Luc de la Corne. He\r\nhad been well treated under the British régime and was one of the\r\nfirst legislative council formed by Carleton. He is reported to\r\nhave been a trimmer during the late troubles.\r\n\r\n[2] One advantage in holding Montreal was that British supplies\r\nand presents for the savages could not reach the interior that\r\nway. Yet the Americans had little means of supplying the Indian\r\ntrade. To meet the difficulty, the commissioners, desirous of\r\nbeing on good terms with the Indians up country, offered early\r\non their arrival, passports to all traders who would enter\r\ninto certain engagements to do nothing in the upper country\r\nprejudicial to the continental interests.\r\n\r\n[3] The first book published in Canada is believed to be\r\n“Catéchisme du Diocèse de Sens Imprimé a Quebec, chez Brown et\r\nGilmour, 1765.” The latter were the proprietors of the Quebec\r\nGazette, the first journal, established on June 21, 1764. The\r\nGazette Littéraire appeared in French, June 3, 1778, and in\r\nFrench and English.\r\n\r\n[4] Mrs. Price, according to Franklin’s letter to the\r\ncommissioners, had three wagon-loads of baggage with her. The\r\nWalkers “took such liberties in taunting at our conduct in Canada\r\nthat it almost came to a quarrel. I think they both have an\r\nexcellent talent in making themselves enemies and I believe even\r\nhere they will never be long without them.” (Franklin’s Works,\r\nVol. VIII, pp. 182-3.)\r\n\r\n[5] On July 4, 1776, the American Congress adopted the\r\nDeclaration of Independence and in 1781, on July 9th, the\r\nArticles of Confederation were ratified.\r\n\r\n[6] Cf.

On June 28th Carleton held a meeting in the Jesuit\r\nchurch of about three hundred Iroquois who offered their\r\nservices. The Caughnawagas, of whom some were present, were\r\nblamed for their neutrality during the war. An arrangement was\r\nentered into for the services of the Iroquois for a year. As the\r\nceremony ended the braves passed by Carleton, each one giving\r\nhim his hand. On July 18th Carleton, still in Montreal, received\r\na deputation of about one hundred and eighty Indians from the\r\nwest offering their active service to their great father, the\r\nking of England, and to their father Carleton. They were received\r\ngraciously and sent away happy.\r\n\r\nBefore leaving, Carleton issued commissions for the creation of\r\njudges in the districts of Montreal and Quebec; a court of appeal\r\nwas established and judges were given authority to examine into,\r\nand report on, the damages suffered during the invasion of the\r\nCongress troops.\r\n\r\nOn the 20th of July 4 the governor returned to Quebec to\r\nreestablish the courts of justice and to restore the legislative\r\ncouncil to its functions. Mr. Fraser, who had been judge of the\r\nCourt of Common Pleas at Montreal since 1764 was at this time a\r\nprisoner among the rebels. In the meantime Carleton, unable to\r\nget on with Lord St. Germain, the secretary in England, resigned\r\nhis position on June 27th, but he did not leave the country till\r\nJune 27th of the following year, 1777, when he was replaced by\r\nHaldimand.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Congress still eyed Canada with longing. On the 4th of\r\nJuly the eleventh article of “confederation and perpetual union”\r\nprovided that Canadas acceding to the confederation and joining\r\nin the measures of the Union “shall be admitted into and entitled\r\nto all the advantages of this union, but no other colony shall be\r\nadmitted to the same unless such admission shall be agreed to by\r\nnine states.” In 1793 another bill was introduced into the United\r\nStates Congress for the admission of Canada, as one or more of\r\nthe United States, whenever asked with the consent of Great\r\nBritain.\r\n\r\nDuring the year 1777 young Marquis de Lafayette, who had joined\r\nthe continental army and had become a major general, backed by\r\nSilas Deane, Major General Horatio Gates and those who thought\r\nthey could use him as a Frenchman to promote the political views\r\nof the congress in Canada, was appointed with an independent\r\ncommand to make an inroad into Canada, Montreal being his\r\nobjective. He was to prevail upon the people to confederate with\r\nthe States, but there was not wanting opposition to ruin the\r\nCanada expedition lest it should ruin Congress, among these being\r\nGouverneur Morris and Arnold. Finally the mortified Lafayette\r\nwas recalled to the “grand army.” But those who promoted him\r\non the grounds of using him and the affection of the French in\r\nCanada for France, as a lever in the present situation were soon\r\nrejoiced with an alliance with France. Lafayette’s projected\r\ndescent on Montreal had come to naught, but what could be\r\nexpected now that the news of an alliance between France and\r\nAmerica became known? The symptoms became evident of universal\r\nunrest. Montreal, already in ferment, was further disturbed in\r\nNovember by a proclamation to the Canadians which was spread\r\nbroadcast through the parishes and seems to have unsettled many\r\nof the best minds as well as those of the hitherto disaffected,\r\nbut who were settling down to loyalty again. It came from the\r\nComte d’Estaing, who had sailed from Toulon in May, 1778, in\r\ncommand of a French fleet of twelve ships of the line and six\r\nfrigates, to throw in their lot with the Americans. It was a\r\nmove long thought of secretly, perhaps long previously nurtured\r\nin the circle of the seigneurs around Montreal. The longings\r\nfor the old régime, it had been thought, had died down. The\r\nnew appeal carried weight not for any love for Congress or\r\nsense of injustice or tyranny evoked on the part of the English\r\ngovernment, but from the powerful reminiscences it awoke. It is\r\nsaid that even the clergy wavered.\r\n\r\nThe proclamation was dated from the “Languedoc in the harbour of\r\nBoston, October 28, 1778.” It opened with the statement that the\r\nundersigned was authorized by His Majesty to offer assistance to\r\nall who were born to taste the sweets of his government. “You\r\nwere born French. There is no other house so august as that of\r\nHenry IV, under which the French can be happy and serve with\r\ndelight.” He did not need to appeal to the companions in arms of\r\nM. le Marquis de Lévis, to those who had seen the brave Montcalm\r\nfall in their defence. “Could such fight against their kinsmen?\r\nAt their names alone the arms should fall from their hands.” The\r\npriests were promised particular protection and consideration\r\nagainst temporal interests. He then argued that it were better\r\nfor a vast monarchy having the same religion, the same customs\r\nand the same language to unite for commerce and wealth with their\r\npowerful neighbours of the United States than with strangers\r\nof another hemisphere who as jealous despots would doubtless,\r\nsooner or later, treat them as a conquered race. “I will not\r\nsuggest to a whole people when it is gaining the right to think\r\nand act, and understand its interest, that to link itself with\r\nthe United States is to seek its happiness; but I will declare,\r\nas formally I do in the name of His Majesty who authorized and\r\ncommanded me so to act, that all the former subjects of North\r\nAmerica who will no longer recognize the supremacy of England may\r\ncount on His Majesty’s protection and support.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DECLARATION ADRESSÉE AU NOM DU ROI A TOUS LES\r\nANCIENS FRANCOIS DE L’AMÉRIQUE SEPTENTRIONALE.

Cette Guerre à été\r\ndéclarée par le message du mois de Mars dernier, par l’Acte le\r\nplus authentique de la Souveraineté ADDRESS TO THE ANCIENT FRENCH\r\nOF NORTH AMERICA]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WILLIAM PITT]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MARQUIS DE LAFAYETTE]\r\n\r\nThis proclamation which said ten words for France and one for\r\nCongress, did not please even the leaders of the Revolution.\r\nWashington viewed it with suspicion for he suspected it meant\r\neventual separation with the advantage all for the French. In\r\nCanada it was most successful. It played adroitly upon the hopes,\r\nambitions, pride, vanity, race instincts and dearest memories, so\r\nthat Haldimand noted in 1779 “a very visible alteration amongst\r\nall ranks of men.” This alteration continued for some time for\r\nHaldimand wrote later: “I have for many months observed in the\r\nCanadian gentry expectations of a revolution.”\r\n\r\nThe war of 1775 had delayed the putting into force of the Quebec\r\nact of 1774. In 1777 the work of readjustment took place. But\r\non the 2d of April, 1778, the merchants of Quebec and Montreal,\r\nthrough a committee of them then in London, returned to the\r\ncharge of petitioning Lord George Germain for the repeal of\r\nthe Quebec act. They again demanded trial by juries and the\r\ncommercial laws of England. They claimed that the Quebec act\r\nreintroduced the feudal system and in consequence the system\r\nof forced corvées and other compulsory services without any\r\nemoluments whatever during the war; hence discontent and\r\ndissatisfaction with His Majesty’s government had crept up. For\r\nthese reasons the memorialists “humbly entreat Your Lordship to\r\ntake into consideration the dangerous and confused situation\r\nof this colony and grant us your Patronage and assistance in\r\nendeavoring to obtain a repeal of the Quebec Act, the source\r\nof these Grievances, and an establishment in its stead of a\r\nfree Government by an assembly or Representation of the People\r\nagreeable to His Majesty’s Royal Promise contained in the\r\nproclamation made in the year 1763.”\r\n\r\nHaldimand in 1780, after an experience of upwards of two years in\r\nthe country, wrote to Germain a direct negative. “It Requires\r\nbut Little Penetration to Discover that had the System of\r\nGovernment Solicited by the Old subjects been adopted in Canada\r\nthis colony would in 1775 have become one of the United States\r\nof America. * * * On the other hand the Quebec Act alone has\r\nprevented, or can in any Degree prevent, the Emissaries of France\r\nfrom succeeding in their Efforts to withdraw the Canadian Clergy\r\nand Noblesse from their allegiance to the Crown of Great Britain.\r\nFor this reason among many others this is not the time for\r\ninnovations and it cannot be Sufficiently inculcated on the part\r\nof Government that the Quebec Act is a Sacred Charter granted by\r\nthe king and Parliament to the Canadians as a Security for their\r\nReligion, Laws and property. * * * The clamour about the trial by\r\njuries and Civil Causes is calculated for the Meridian in London;\r\nin Canada Moderate and upright Men are convinced of the abuses\r\nto which that institution is liable in a Small Community where\r\nthe jurors may be all Traders and very frequently either directly\r\nor indirectly connected with the Parties. * * * Be assured, My\r\nLord, that however good the institution of Juries may be found\r\nin England, the People of this Country have a great aversion to\r\nthem.”\r\n\r\nOn September 2d the definitive treaty of peace and friendship\r\nbetween His Britannic Majesty and the United States of America\r\nwas signed at Paris. As soon as this was known the British\r\npopulation at Montreal with that of Quebec again began agitating\r\nfor a change in the constitution. Their numerical strength was\r\nlittle, but their activity great. Four years later Mr. Hugh\r\nFinlay, postmaster general and member of the council, writing on\r\nOctober 2, 1784, to Sir Evan Nepean criticizing the agitation for\r\nan assembly says: “The advocates for a House of Assembly in this\r\nProvince take it for granted that the people in general wish to\r\nbe represented; but that is only a guess for I will venture to\r\naffirm that not a Canadian landowner in fifty ever once thought\r\non the Subject and were it proposed to him he would readily\r\ndeclare his incapacity to Judge of the Matter. Although the\r\nCanadian Peasants are far from being a stupid race they are at\r\npresent an ignorant people from want of instruction; not a man in\r\n500 among them can read. The Females in this Country have a great\r\nadvantage over the males in point of Education. * * * Before we\r\nthink of a house of Assembly for this country let us lay the\r\nFoundation for useful Knowledge to fit the people to Judge of\r\ntheir Situation and deliberate for the future wellbeing of the\r\nProvince. The first step towards this desirable End is to have\r\na free School in every Parish. Let the schoolmasters be English\r\nif we would make Englishmen of the Canadians; let the Masters be\r\nRoman Catholic if it is necessary, for perhaps the people at the\r\ninstigation of their Priests would not put their children under\r\nthe tuition of a Protestant.”\r\n\r\nThe English population of Quebec and Montreal did not think\r\nwith Finlay, for two days later, on November 24th, at Quebec,\r\nthey presented a petition for a House of Assembly outlining a\r\ndefinite plan which they had never done before, having always\r\nleft it to his Majesty’s pleasure. It was the most numerously\r\nsigned document as yet appearing, bearing over two hundred and\r\nthirty-three Quebec names, with, about eighteen of Three Rivers\r\nand two hundred-forty-six in Montreal.\r\n\r\nOn November 30th, a counter meeting was held in a convent of\r\nthe Recollects and the objections of the French Canadians to\r\nthe petition above were registered, at the same time an address\r\nwas drawn up to the king briefly stating that the House of\r\nAssembly “is not the unanimous wish nor the general Desire of\r\nyour Canadian People who through Poverty and the misfortunes of\r\na recent war of which this colony has been the Theatre are not\r\nin condition to bear the Taxes which must necessarily ensue and\r\nthat in many respects the petition for it appears contrary to and\r\ninconsistent with the wellbeing of the New Catholic Subjects of\r\nYour Majesty.” On the 25th of February next, 1785, the seigneurs\r\nand leading men were authorized at meetings held in the parishes\r\nto sign a petition against any change as advocated by the\r\npetition of 1784.\r\n\r\nWhile the constitutional struggle is going on and preparations\r\nare being made for the drafting of some inevitable amendments\r\nto the Quebec act, we may now turn to an important move being\r\nagitated to promote a larger sense of civic progress and\r\nmunicipal freedom. The history of the future municipality of\r\nMontreal may now be said to be in its conceptional stage.\r\n\r\nIn November of 1786 the merchants and citizens of Montreal,\r\nQuebec and Three Rivers were taken into consideration by a\r\ncommittee of the Council of Legislature who asked them to give\r\ntheir views on the state of the external and internal commerce\r\nand the police of the province. The Montreal names given in the\r\ninvitation are: Neven Sylvestre, E.W. Gray, St. George Dupré,\r\nJames McGill, Pierre Guy, James Finlay, J.S. Goddard, Pierre\r\nMessiere, Pierre Fortier, Hertel de Rouville, John Campbell,\r\nEdward Southouse, Alexander Fraser, Jacques Le Moyne, Benj.\r\nFrobisher, Stephen de Lancey, Esq., and Messrs. Jacob Jordan,\r\nIsaac Todd, Forsyth J. Blondeau, P. Perinault, Richard Dobie,\r\nF. Chaboillez, McBeth and William Pollard, merchants. These\r\nwho appreciated the courtesy of being taken into consideration\r\nthought it their duty to “call in and collect the general voice\r\nof our citizens without delay.” “The report of the Merchants\r\nof Montreal by their Committee to the Honorable Committee of\r\nCouncil on Commercial Affairs and Police” subsequently appeared\r\ndated Montreal, 23d January, 1787, and contained observations\r\non various points: e. g., “the establishment of a chamber of\r\ncommerce duly incorporated.”\r\n\r\nThis had been already promoted in Quebec ten years previously\r\nand a plan presented on April 3, 1777. The object of this Quebec\r\nplan, according to Shortt and Doughty (Constitutional Documents)\r\nwas to avoid bringing commercial matters into the regular courts\r\nwhere under the Quebec act the French and not the English civil\r\nlaw was made the basis of decision. The virtual effect of this\r\nplan, had it been authorized, would have been to set up a\r\nlegislative, executive and judicial system within the Province\r\nto govern the trade relations of the members of the Chamber;\r\nand this in time must have involved the trade of others dealing\r\nwith them. The observation of the Montreal committee on this is:\r\n“However beneficial to Trade and Commerce, Institutions of this\r\nnature be considered, yet we are of opinion that the same would\r\nprove ineffectual and inexpedient at this time; considering the\r\nconnection that subsists more or less among the Trading People of\r\nthis Place.” Observations were also returned on “Holding tenures\r\nand the abolition of Circuits,” “The present establishment of\r\nAppeals in Commercial Causes,” “The establishment of a Court of\r\nChancery” on “a register of all deeds,” on a “Bankrupt Law,” and\r\non the subject of Police in city administration in general.\r\n\r\nThere also were a number of important observations made of a\r\nhistorical value. The first to be quoted heralds the idea of a\r\ncharter of corporation for Montreal. The question had also been\r\nput for Quebec: “Whether or not we should apply for a charter,\r\nincorporating a select number of citizens on some good and\r\nImproved Plan with Powers to make By-laws, deeds, Civil and\r\nCriminal Causes under certain restrictions, whether under the\r\nstile and Title of Recorder, Mayor, Aldermen and Common Council\r\nof the City and County of Quebec and the Precincts and Liberties\r\nthereof or under any other Denomination,”--and similarly for\r\na like charter for Montreal. The observation of the Montreal\r\nCommittee was as follows:\r\n\r\n“The bad state of the Police of this Town calls loudly for Reform\r\nand tho’ Government in its Wisdom has attended thereto by the\r\nAppointment of an Inspector of Police, yet we are sorry that the\r\nAppointment has in no wise proven adequate to the Intent, and\r\nby Experience we find that the exertions of the Magistrates are\r\nnot sufficient to remedy the Evil complained of. We beg leave\r\nto point out as the only remedy that can be applied with Effect\r\nthe incorporating by Charter, of a select number of the Citizens\r\nof Montreal on a good and approved Plan with such Powers and\r\nprivileges as are usually granted to Corporations for the purpose\r\nof Police only. And we further beg to request that in case the\r\nHonorable Council should approve of this move and Government\r\ninclined to grant the same, That it be recommended to His\r\nExcellency, Lord Dorchester, to bestow on the Corporations such\r\nlots of Ground and Houses, the Property of the Crown, within the\r\nTown and Suburbs of Montreal as Government has no present use for\r\nin order to the same being applied towards the Erecting Schools,\r\nworkhouses and other Establishments of Public Utility.”\r\n\r\nOther observations followed on the necessity of regulations to\r\nreduce the number of liquor licenses for public houses, and for\r\nthe avoidance of fires, to enact that no wooden fence or building\r\nof wood of what description soever be erected in the town of\r\nMontreal in future under a severe penalty.\r\n\r\nBut the idea of a Municipal Corporation though now sown was not\r\nto fructify till many years later. In the meantime the civic\r\ngovernment by justices of the peace or magistrates obtained as\r\nbefore.\r\n\r\nWe must now return to the final stages of the Constitutional\r\nstruggle for an Assembly. An important factor has now entered\r\ninto the political aspect of the province, namely the advent of\r\nthe United Empire Loyalists, now beginning to leave the United\r\nStates for a wider freedom to settle on the lands above Montreal,\r\nas were also the disbanded troops, a move which did much more\r\nthan anything else to promote the movement for an assembly, and\r\nto point the direction in which the amendments to the Quebec act\r\nmust follow.\r\n\r\nOn April 11, 1786, Sir John Johnson, then in London, presented a\r\npetition from the officers of the disbanded troops praying for a\r\nchange in the tenure of land. They prayed for the establishment\r\nof a district from Point au Baudet upwards, distinct from the\r\nprovince of Quebec, in which they prayed that “the blessings of\r\nthe British laws and of the British government and an exemption\r\nfrom the French tenures,” might be extended to them. There is no\r\ndoubt, as Lord Dorchester[2] remarked in his letter of June 13,\r\n1787, that the English party had gained strength by the arrival\r\nof the loyalists and the desire for an Assembly would no doubt\r\nincrease.\r\n\r\nAt this time the movement for dividing the country into an upper\r\nand lower province began. It was thought premature by Dorchester.\r\nBut the act of 1791 thought otherwise. By February 9, 1789,\r\naccording to the letter of Hugh Finlay, “the great question\r\nwhether a House of Assembly would contribute to the welfare of\r\nthis Province in its present state has been so fully discussed\r\nthat the subject is entirely exhausted; both old and New Subjects\r\nhere who have openly declared their sentiments now Composedly\r\nawait the decision of the British Parliament with respect to\r\nCanadian affairs.”\r\n\r\nIn the Montreal district the seigneurs held their old position\r\nwhile the merchants never budged from their original demand in\r\ngeneral for an assembly though their plans had been greatly\r\nmodified. The next two years were spent in preparing drafts\r\nfor the Constitutional act which was passed in 1791 under the\r\ntitle of “An act to repeal certain Parts of an Act” passed in\r\nthe Fourteenth Year of His Majesty’s Reign entitled “an Act\r\nfor making more effectual Provision for the Government of the\r\nProvince of Quebec in North America and to make further Provision\r\nfor the Government of the said Province.”\r\n\r\nOwing to the uncertainty of the maintenance of peace with Spain\r\nin 1789, the Canada act was not introduced into parliament until\r\n1790. On the 7th of March, 1791, Pitt introduced the bill to\r\ndivide Canada into two provinces. The bill became a law on the\r\n14th of May, 1791. It divided Canada into two parts, Lower and\r\nUpper; each province was to have an executive council appointed\r\nby the crown, Lower Canada to have no less than fifteen members\r\nand Upper Canada no fewer than seven; each was to have a\r\nlegislative assembly, the members for Lower Canada to be no less\r\nthan fifty and those for Upper Canada to be no less than sixteen.\r\n\r\nThe long struggle of the Merchants of Montreal for an assembly\r\nwas at last ended.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              NOTE\r\n\r\n MONTREAL NAMES ATTACHED TO THE PETITION FOR AN ASSEMBLY.

We get an idea of\r\nthe national origins or religion of some of the early settlers\r\nfrom the censuses prepared by government for jury service.\r\nIn the last of 1765 there are 136 Protestant names and their\r\nbirthplace, former occupation and present calling are given. Of\r\nthese thirty-seven were from Ireland (mostly soldiers who became\r\ninn-keepers), thirty from England, twenty-six from Scotland,\r\nthirteen from New England, sixteen from Germany, six from\r\nSwitzerland and one each from France, Canada, Lapland, Italy and\r\nGuernsey. The origin of three is undetermined.\r\n\r\nThe earliest merchants, as we have seen, were scored by Murray\r\nand afterwards by Carleton. The records of the “military courts”\r\nfrom 1760 to 1763 show that there was some cause for it. Yet it\r\nis pleasing to hear Murray writing as early as December, 1760,\r\nconfess as follows: “I flatter myself you will pardon the liberty\r\nI take in troubling you with the enclosed (petition); it regards\r\na set of men who have been very serviceable to His Majesty’s\r\ntroops, who have run many risks and who have been induced to pour\r\nin their merchandise here for a laudable prospect of promoting\r\ntrade at the invitation of Mr. Amherst, the commander in chief.”\r\n\r\nHoward, Chinn and Bostwick was probably the first British firm\r\nin Montreal. Chinn became the deputy provost marshal and got\r\nthe licenses from Quebec; he also himself traded up country.\r\nJoseph Howard shortly severed his connection with the firm and\r\nestablished himself successfully on St. Paul street. William\r\nBostwick was a hatter but, hats not being in much demand, he\r\njoined the Indian trade.\r\n\r\nJew merchants early settled here; the earliest firm was probably\r\nthat of the Levy Brothers, Solomon, Eleazer, Gershom and Simon.\r\nGershom came with the soldiers, Eleazer in 1763, and the other\r\ntwo were already settled here by this date. The firm of Ezekiel\r\nSolomon & Company was established in 1764. Tobias Isenhout was\r\na German sutler who prospered in the Indian trade, but was\r\nmurdered in 1771 or 1772 on a business trip by Michel Dué, his\r\nFrench clerk, who was subsequently hanged under the mutiny act.\r\nThe Honourable Conrad Gugy, a Swiss, settled in the Montreal\r\ndistrict and became a legislative councillor. He died in April,\r\n1786, and was buried in the Dorchester street cemetery. Lawrence\r\nErmantinger arrived in 1762 and became a prosperous merchant.\r\nHis name appears on many of the petitions sent from Montreal.\r\nBenjamin Price was another legislative councillor, coming to\r\nCanada in 1762 and died in 1768. James Price, of Price & Haywood,\r\nwas from New England, as was his partner. James Price it was who\r\nabetted Ethan Allen in his march on Montreal. The name of Thomas\r\nWalker, another merchant, enters largely into Montreal history,\r\nas we have seen. James Finlay came to Montreal in 1762; he was\r\nthe first of the Englishmen to reach the upper Saskatchewan,\r\nwintering at Nipawi House in 1771-2. He was one of those who\r\nestablished the first Protestant school in the city; one of the\r\nfounders of the first Presbyterian church and one of the signers\r\nof the capitulation to Montgomery in 1775. Alexander Henry came\r\nto Montreal with the troops and became a great explorer in\r\nthe Indian trade. One of his spells up country lasted fifteen\r\nyears. He was one of the founders of the North West Company. In\r\n1796 he retired from the Indian trade and lived to the age of\r\neighty-four, dying in Montreal on April 4, 1824. The prosperous\r\ncity merchants, McGill Brothers, John, James and Andrew, were\r\nall settled by 1774. The firm of McTavish, Frobisher & Company\r\nstands out as the actual founders of the North West Company, the\r\nrivals of the Great Company. Of the Frobisher Brothers, Benjamin\r\nseems to have settled first, before 1765. He died in 1787; Joseph\r\nretired from business in 1798; Thomas died ten years earlier at\r\nthe age of forty-four. Simon McTavish came after the others.\r\n\r\nThe professions were not well represented by the English at\r\nthis time. Dr. Daniel Robertson, a retired lieutenant from the\r\nforty-second regiment, practiced medicine in the city after the\r\nconquest and there was a Doctor Huntly. Edward Antill was the\r\nonly English lawyer, moving here from New England in 1770. The\r\nfirst Protestant school master was an Irishman, John Pullman,\r\nbrought from New York in 1773. The first Protestant divine was a\r\nSwiss, the Reverend Dr. Chatrand Delisle, who came in 1766. In\r\nstriking contrast with latter-day practice, this clergyman’s name\r\nheads the list of the supporters of practically all applicants\r\nfor liquor licenses in the city in his time.\r\n\r\nThe traders who left Montreal for the distant posts had no\r\nlicense office in the city. Recourse had to be made to Quebec,\r\nand the delay was annoying, although, no doubt, Edward Chinn,\r\nwho was the deputy provost marshal, did his best for his fellow\r\nMontreal merchants. The value of the cargoes taken on the\r\nup-country ventures averaged about five hundred pounds, and their\r\ndestinations, recorded on the passes, were mostly Oswegatchie,\r\nLaBarge, Niagara, Detroit, Michillimackinac and the Grand\r\nPortage on Lake Superior. The canoe men were voyageurs from\r\nMontreal and the district.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE HON. JAMES McGILL A prosperous Montreal\r\nmerchant, the founder of McGill University. He was born in\r\nGlasgow, October 6, 1744, and died at Montreal, December 18,\r\n1813.]\r\n\r\nThe following gives some idea of their ventures:\r\n\r\nMonday, April 26, 1771, pass for Edward Chinn’s men--seven\r\nmen--£550 merchandise, ten fusils, 500 pounds gunpowder, 350\r\npounds shot and ball.\r\n\r\nNo. 10--Ezekial Solomon (April 10, 1772)--two canoes to\r\nMichillimackinac, value £800; twenty men (La Prairie); 1,400\r\npounds shot and ball.\r\n\r\nNo. 21--Benj. and Jos. Frobisher--3 canoes for Grand Portage;\r\nmerchandise £2,000, fusils 96, powder, 2,000 pounds, shot, etc.,\r\n1,300 pounds; liquor, 260 gals.; men, 28.\r\n\r\nNo. 10--Jas. and John McGill (March 10, 1773)--3 canoes; value\r\nabout £1,500; 48 guns, etc.; 23 men.\r\n\r\nNo. 65--James Morrison--1 small bateau, Niagara (July 17,\r\n1775)--4 men; 22 bales mdse.; 1 quarter cask wine; 1 bbl. loaf\r\nsugar; 1 bbl. coffee; 1 bbl. salt; 1 bbl. tea; 1 nest brass\r\nkettles.\r\n\r\nIn the beginning the merchants themselves would join the party;\r\nlater, becoming richer, they entrusted it to an agent. On the\r\nreturn they brought down the pelts to Montreal, whence they were\r\ntransferred by river sloops to Quebec for London, with which\r\nthere was a close connection. The “Mdse.” carried was for Indian\r\ntrade and contained scalping knives, hatchets, paints, blankets,\r\nhosiery, beads, etc.\r\n\r\nWe have spoken of the Montreal merchants after the capitulation\r\nof the city engaging in the fur trade.[1] As early as 1765 yearly\r\nattempts were made by the first adventurers to trade with the\r\nnorthwest beyond Michillimackinac, but with little success. In\r\n1768 other adventurers joined, but in 1769 Benjamin and Joseph\r\nFrobisher formed a connection with Messrs. Todd and McGill.\r\nGradually others were added. At first their canoes had difficulty\r\nin getting beyond Lake La Pluye, for the natives plundered their\r\ngoods, but later they reached Lake Bourbon. This encouraged the\r\ntraders to persevere and by 1774 new ports were discovered,\r\nhitherto unknown to the French. New adventurers followed in\r\ntheir wake, independently, and, without regard to the management\r\nof the Indians and the common good of the trade, soon caused\r\ndisorder, so that many of the substantial traders retired, there\r\nonly remaining at the latter end of 1782 twelve who persevered.\r\nThese, convinced by long experience of the advantage that would\r\narise from a general connection, not only calculated to secure\r\nand promote their mutual interests but also to guard against any\r\nencroachments of the United States on the line of boundary as\r\nceded them by treaty from Lake Superior to Lake du Bois, entered\r\nupon and concluded articles of agreement under the title of the\r\nNorth West Company, dividing it into sixteen shares. These were\r\narranged as follows: Todd & McGill, two shares; Benjamin and\r\nJoseph Frobisher, two shares; McGill & Paterson, two shares;\r\nMcTavish & Company, two shares; Holmes & Grant, two shares;\r\nWalker & Company, two shares; McBeath & Company, two shares;\r\nRoss & Company, one share; Oakes & Company, one share. The above\r\nseemed to have been bound together about 1779, but the North\r\nWest Company, as such, seems to date from about 1782 and for a\r\n“term of five years” as first promoted. (Benjamin Frobisher to\r\nDoctor McBane, April 1, 1784.)\r\n\r\nThe story of the North West Company founded at Montreal must now\r\nbe told. The war of 1775-6 had sadly interfered with the trade of\r\nMontreal with the Indians up country. Haldimand set to work to\r\nhelp the traders to rebuild it. A report of April 24, 1780, of\r\nCharles Grant, one of the members of the North West Company, to\r\nHaldimand, reveals the enterprise of the founders of Montreal’s\r\ncommercial prosperity, thus, that “at all times the trades of\r\nthe upper countries had been considered the staple trade in this\r\nProvince but of late years it has been greatly increased, in\r\nso much that it may be reckoned one year with another to have\r\nproduced an annual return to Great Britain in Furrs to the amount\r\nof £200,000 sterling, which is an object deserving of all the\r\nencouragement and protection which Government can with propriety\r\ngive to that trade. The Indian Trade by every communication is\r\ncarried on at a great expense, labour and risk of both men and\r\nproperty; every year furnishes instances of the loss of men and\r\ngoods by accident and otherwise; indeed few of them are able\r\nto purchase with ready money such goods as they want for their\r\ntrade. They are consequently indebted from year to year until a\r\nreturn is made in Furrs to the merchants of Quebec and Montreal\r\nwho are importers of goods from England and furnish them on\r\ncredit. In this manner the Upper Country Trade is chiefly carried\r\non by men of low circumstances, destitute of every means to pay\r\ntheir debts when their trade fails; and if it should be under\r\ngreat restraints or obstructed a few years the consequences will\r\nprove ruinous to the commercial party of this Province and very\r\nhurtful to the merchants of London, shippers of goods to this\r\ncountry, besides the loss of so valuable branch of trade in\r\nGreat Britain. In these troublesome times the least stop to the\r\nIndian Trade might be very productive of very bad effects, even\r\namong the savages who are at present our friends or neuter, who\r\non seeing no supply of goods would immediately change sides and\r\njoin the enemies of the Government under pretense that the rebels\r\nhad got the better of us and that we had not it in our power to\r\nsupply them any more. All the property in the Upper Countries\r\nin such a case would become an easy prey to their resentment;\r\nand the lives of all of His Majesty’s Subjects doing business in\r\nthese Countries at the time of a rupture of this nature might\r\nprobably fall a sacrifice to the fury and rage of disappointed,\r\nuncivilized barbarians.”\r\n\r\nHe then gives an insight into the value of each canoe load: “I am\r\ninformed that of late years, from ninety to one hundred canoes\r\nhave annually been employed in the Indian Trade from Montreal\r\nby the communications of the Great River to Michillimackinac,\r\nLakes Huron and Michigan, LaBarge, and the North West. * * * In\r\nthis I shall insert the average value of a canoe load of goods\r\nat the time of departure from Montreal, Michillimackinac and\r\nat the Grand Portage. * * * A canoe load of goods is reckoned\r\nat Montreal worth in dry goods to the amount of £300, first\r\nsterling cost in England, with fifty per cent charges thereon\r\nmakes £150; besides that every canoe carries about 200 gallons\r\nof rum and wine which I suppose worth £50 more, so that every\r\ncanoe on departure from that place may be said worth £500,\r\ncurrency of this Province. The charges of all sorts included\r\ntogether from Montreal to Michillimackinac, £160, and from\r\nthence to the Grand Portage, £90; so it appears that each canoe\r\nat Michillimackinac is worth £660, currency; every canoe is\r\nnavigated by eight men for the purpose of transporting the goods\r\nonly and when men go up to winter they commonly carry ten.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: From a sketch by R.G. Mathews, Esq. FIRST\r\nRESIDENCE AND STORE OF THE HON. JAMES McGILL]\r\n\r\nThe report ends with an appeal for the early issue of passes.\r\nFor “last year the passes were given out so late that it was\r\nimpossible to forward goods to the places of destination,\r\nespecially in the North West. Considering the great number of\r\npeople in this province immediately interested in the Indian\r\nTrade it is hardly possible to suppose but there may be among\r\nthem some disaffected men, but the major part of them I sincerely\r\nbelieve are sure friends to Government and it would be hard the\r\nwhole community should suffer for the sake of a few bad men since\r\nregulations and laws are or may be made sufficiently severe to\r\nprevent in a great measure, or altogether, every effort that\r\nmay be made to convey goods to the enemy and if any person,\r\nwhatever, should attempt to ignore or violate such regulations\r\nas are made for the safety of the whole, the law ought to be put\r\ninto execution against him with the utmost rigour on conviction\r\nof guilt and the offender never should be forgiven offences\r\ncommitted against the publick in general.” From which we may\r\nlearn that our justly honoured pioneer Montreal merchants were\r\nlaw-abiding citizens and were not among the rebels of 1775-6.\r\n\r\nThis letter was followed by a memorial from the North West\r\ntraders on May 11, 1780, asking for no let or hindrance to the\r\ndeparture of the canoes. The additional names of Adam Lymburner\r\nand J. Porteous appear adjoined to this.\r\n\r\nOn October 4, 1784, Benjamin and Joseph Frobisher, the directors\r\nof the North West Company, memorialized General Haldimand,\r\npraying him to recommend to His Majesty’s ministers to grant to\r\nthe North West Company an exclusive privilege of trade from Lake\r\nSuperior to that country for ten years only as a reward “for\r\ndiscovering a new passage to the River Ouinipigue and thereby\r\neffectively securing to this Province the Furr trade to the\r\nNorth West. And in consideration, also, of exploring at their\r\nown expense between the latitudes of 55 and 65, all that Tract\r\nof Country west of Hudson’s Bay to the North Pacific Ocean and\r\ncommunicating to Government such surveys and other information\r\nrespecting that Country as it may be in their power to obtain.”\r\n\r\nMr. Peter Pond, one of the company, in memorializing Governor\r\nHamilton on the 18th of April in the following year, begs him to\r\nrecommend the memorial, already mentioned, of the Frobishers “as\r\na plan which will be productive of Great National advantages” and\r\nthe ten years’ exclusive monopoly as “only a reward for the toil\r\nand expense of such an arduous and public Spirited Enterprise.”\r\n\r\nThis company gained in strength. While its headquarters were in\r\nMontreal, it had “wintering” partners in the interior posts.\r\nFort William became the meeting ground of the partners who were\r\nmerchant princes of the period for the annual meetings which are\r\ndescribed by Washington Irving in “Astoria” as marked with great\r\nsplendour. It provided serious competition for the Hudson’s Bay\r\nCompany. The policy of the latter had been only to trade in the\r\nwinter with the natives, thus making a close season in summer.\r\nTheir posts were at first all on the coast, but the competition\r\nforced them also to seek interior quarters. The contributions\r\nto our geographical knowledge provided by the earlier explorers\r\nof the first North West Company include the first overland\r\njourney to the Pacific Ocean made by Sir Alexander Mackenzie in\r\n1793 and his previous descent in 1789 from Lake Athabasca to the\r\nArctic Ocean by the Mackenzie River, called after this explorer,\r\nfrom Montreal. The discovery of the Peace River must also be\r\nattributed to him.\r\n\r\nIn 1798, troubles arising among the partners, the seceding\r\nparty formed a rival firm popularly known as the “X.Y.” from\r\nthose initials following the W. in N.W. Company.[2] Jealous\r\nand rancourous friction arose again and the two companies were\r\namalgamated in 1804 into one firm called the North West Company.\r\nIt became a powerful body, purely Canadian and with exclusive\r\nprivileges. Sir Alexander Mackenzie was its moving spirit and his\r\ncousin Roderick became one of the chief agents.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the great North West Company by 1806 had spread over\r\nthe continent from the Great Lakes to the remote side of the\r\nRocky Mountains and had established a trading post at Columbia\r\nRiver. By 1812 it had fifty agents, seventy interpreters and\r\nover one thousand one hundred voyageurs. Thus when the partners,\r\nmostly Scotchmen, met at Fort William they were surrounded by\r\nretainers and they acted like barons of old, the story of their\r\nfeasting and lavishness lighting up the tale of the otherwise\r\ndreary days--the old north west days--and when they met at\r\ntheir famous Beaver Club in Montreal they added considerable\r\nmagnificence to the social life of the city.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile another rival to the North West Company was arising in\r\nthe person of the founder of the Astor family. John Jacob Astor,\r\nborn in the honest little village of Waldorf, near Heidelberg,\r\non the banks of the Rhine, arrived in America in a ship bound\r\nfor Baltimore in the month of January, 1783. In 1784 he settled\r\nin New York and soon turned his attention exclusively to the fur\r\ntrade. The peltry trade not being regularly organized in the\r\nUnited States, he determined to go to Canada, the seat of the\r\nmain supply. Accordingly he made annual visits to Montreal and\r\nthence shipped furs to London, as trade was not allowed otherwise\r\nthan directly with the old country.\r\n\r\nIn 1794 or 1795 a treaty with Great Britain lifted the trade\r\nrestrictions and a direct commercial intercourse was established\r\nwith the United States. Mr. Astor then made a contract with the\r\nNorth West Company and he was now enabled to ship furs direct\r\nfrom Montreal to the United States for the home supply. In 1809\r\nhe obtained a charter from the legislature of New York state\r\nincorporating a company under the name of “The American Fur\r\nCompany.” In 1811 he bought out the Anglo-Canadian Company,\r\nthe “Mackinaw,” whose headquarters were at Michillimackinac,\r\nand merging it into the American Fur Company, called it the\r\n“South West Company,” or the “Pacific Fur Company,” as it\r\nafterwards became known. He associated with himself, as his\r\nagents several of those who had hitherto served the North West\r\nCompany of Montreal, among these being Alexander McKay, who\r\nhad accompanied Sir Alexander Mackenzie in 1789 and 1793, Duncan\r\nMcDougal and Donald Mackenzie. He planned headquarters at the\r\nnorth of the Columbia River. Accordingly the expedition was sent\r\nout in duplicate to the mouth of the Columbia River, one-half\r\ngoing on a six-months’ voyage around Cape Horn in a sailing\r\nvessel, the Iroquois, the other marching overland or canoeing\r\non lakes and rivers in eighteen months from Montreal via the\r\nMississippi and the Missouri, to the mouth of the Columbia River.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ERECTED 1759 John Jacob Astor, the founder of the\r\nAstor fortunes, is said to have lived in this building, on the\r\nsouthwest corner of Vaudreuil and Ste. Therese streets, still\r\nstanding, and stored here Canadian beaver, racoon and muskrat\r\nskins, Canadian coatings, etc., all of which he sold in 1789 at\r\nNo. 81 Queen Street, New York.]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: OLD ST. GABRIEL CHURCH ON ST. GABRIEL STREET\r\nErected in 1792, standing till recently. The first “Scotch”\r\nChurch in the Province. Its chief supporters were the Scotch\r\nfur-traders of the North-West Company. The bell in the steeple\r\nof this church is said to have been “the first Protestant bell\r\nsounded in Canada.”]\r\n\r\nThe voyageurs he got at Montreal in July, 1810, were not of\r\nthe best, for the old rival North West Company had secretly\r\ninterdicted the prime hands from engaging in the new service. It\r\nwas not long after the party left Lachine for St. Anne’s that the\r\n“recruits enlisted at Montreal were fit to vie with the rugged\r\nregiment of Falstaff; some were able-bodied but inexpert; others\r\nwere expert but lazy; while a third class were expert but totally\r\nworn, being brokendown veterans incapable of toil.” (“Astoria,”\r\nby Washington Irving, Chapter XII.)\r\n\r\nThese two parties together founded “Astoria” at the mouth of the\r\nColumbia. But most of Astor’s employees were British subjects\r\nderived from men of the North West and Mackinaw Companies, and\r\nwhen the 1812 War broke out between the United States and Great\r\nBritain a British warship came up the Pacific coast and promptly\r\nturned it into “Fort George.” Forthwith the North West Company\r\nbought up the derelict property of Mr. Astor’s company. British\r\nemployees and a few Americans in the concern retreated inland and\r\nafter almost incredible suffering from the attacks of unfriendly\r\nIndians succeeded in reaching the Mississippi.” (“Pioneers in\r\nCanada,” by Sir Harry Johnston.)\r\n\r\nBut the most powerful rival of the North West Company was to be\r\nfound in the person of Lord Selkirk, who had bought two-fifths\r\nof the stock of the Hudson’s Bay Company. In May, 1811, he\r\nprevailed on the directors to grant him 160,000 square miles of\r\nterritory in fee simple on condition he should establish a colony\r\nand furnish from the settlers men required by the company at a\r\ncertain rate. In 1811 ninety persons, mostly Highland cotters\r\nfrom Sutherlandshire, with some emigrants from the west of\r\nIreland, reached Hudson’s Bay, sent by Selkirk. Others followed\r\nin subsequent years. This may be regarded as the beginning of the\r\nNorth West Red River settlement. Its history was one of bitter\r\nrivalry for the Montreal company. This was felt all the more\r\nsince Lord Selkirk, being a Douglas and a Scot, had after the\r\nfailure of this first settlement in Canada at Buldoon received\r\nmuch hospitality and attention at Montreal from the Scottish\r\nmerchants of the company, who had given him so much inside\r\ninformation on the subject of the fur trade industry that he\r\nhad turned his thoughts to the Hudson’s Bay Company and become\r\nfor many years the most determined opponent of his hosts. This\r\nopposition, to the extent of bloodshed, did not cease till the\r\nunion of the two bodies as the reestablished Hudson’s Bay Company\r\nin 1821.\r\n\r\nBut the competition with Selkirk’s Hudson’s Bay party had\r\nbrought sorry losses to both; no dividends were able to be paid\r\nby the North West and there was a loss of men on either side\r\nin the sanguinary incursions into one another’s territories.\r\nThe amalgamation of 1821 was therefore not too soon. The union\r\nwas followed by the gift of the government to the impoverished\r\ncompanies of the exclusive trade of the territory which, under\r\nthe names of the Hudson’s Bay and North West territories,\r\nextended from Labrador to the Pacific and from Red River to\r\nthe Arctic Ocean. The Hudson’s Bay Company, as the amalgamated\r\ncompany was called, held Rupert’s Land by perpetual charter and\r\nthe rest of the territory, including Vancouver Island, granted to\r\nit in 1848 by special license till 1859, maintaining under its\r\nsupreme rule about four million square miles. In 1860 it employed\r\nfive surgeons, eighty-seven clerks, sixty-seven postmasters,\r\n1,200 permanent servants and 500 voyageurs, making with temporary\r\nemployees about three thousand men on its payroll, while about\r\none hundred thousand Indians were actively engaged in supplying\r\nit with furs. Its profits were enormous, being from May 31,\r\n1852, to May 31, 1862, an annual average of £81,000 on a paid-up\r\ncapital of £400,000. In 1863 the company was reorganized with a\r\ncapital of £2,000,000, with Sir Edmund Head as governor. After\r\nconfederation the northwestern territories and Manitoba were\r\njoined to the Dominion on the indemnification of £3,000,000. This\r\nwill be told in its place. Henceforth the old company, no longer\r\na feudal government, is to play its part as one of the mercantile\r\nbodies of Canada, but one which still has a great civilizing\r\npower in the northern wilds of Canada.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         THE BEAVER CLUB\r\n\r\n  “The members of the famous Beaver Club, constituted perhaps\r\n  the most picturesque and magnificent aristocracy that has ever\r\n  dominated the life of any young community on this continent, with\r\n  the possible exception of the tobacco lords of Virginia. The\r\n  majority of them were adventurous Scotsmen, but they included\r\n  French-Canadians, Englishmen and a few Irishmen, and were\r\n  thoroughly cosmopolitan by taste and associations.”\r\n\r\nThe Beaver Club was instituted at Montreal in the year 1785,\r\nby the merchants then carrying on the Indian trade of Canada.\r\nOriginally the club consisted of but nineteen members, all\r\nvoyageurs, having wintered in the Indian Country, and having been\r\nin the trade from their youth. Subsequently the membership was\r\nextended to fifty-five, with ten Honorary Members.\r\n\r\nOn the first Wednesday in December of each year, the social\r\ngatherings were inaugurated by a dinner at which all members\r\nresiding in the town were expected to be present.\r\n\r\nThe club assumed powers which would, in the present day, be\r\nstrongly resisted; among the most notable of them was the rule,\r\nthat “no member shall have a party at his house on club days, nor\r\naccept invitations; but if in town, must attend, except prevented\r\nby indisposition.”\r\n\r\nThe meetings were held fortnightly from December to April and\r\nthere was, in addition, a summer club for the captains of the fur\r\nvessels, who, in some instances, were honorary members.\r\n\r\nThe object of the meetings (as set forth in the rules) was “to\r\nbring together, at stated periods, during the winter season,\r\na set of men highly respectable in society, who had passed\r\ntheir best days in a savage country and had encountered the\r\ndifficulties and dangers incident to a pursuit of the fur trade\r\nof Canada.”\r\n\r\nThe members recounted the perils they had passed through and\r\nafter passing around the Indian emblem of peace (the calumet),\r\nthe officer appointed for the purpose, made a suitable harangue.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[1] The effect of the conquest on the fur trade in the Northwest,\r\naccording to Mr. Beckles Wilson, “The Great Company,” was that\r\nfor awhile the Indians and the _voyageurs_ and _coureurs de bois_\r\nawaited patiently for the French traders. Many of the French thus\r\ncut off intermarried with the Indians and virtually lived as such.\r\n\r\n[2] The new North West Company were composed of Gregory and\r\nMcLeod, now independent. It was first called the “little\r\nCompany,” or the “Potties,” an American corruption of the French\r\n“Les Petit.” Later it developed into the X.Y. Company, or Sir\r\nAlexander Mackenzie’s Company. Alexander Mackenzie and his\r\ncousin, Roderick Mackenzie, became the chief agents of the new\r\ncompany. (Alexander Mackenzie was knighted in 1799.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                           CHAPTER XII\r\n\r\n                  FRENCH REVOLUTIONARY DESIGNS\r\n\r\n                 MONTREAL THE SEAT OF JACOBINISM\r\n\r\n  THE ASSEMBLY AT LAST--MONTREAL REPRESENTATIVES--FRENCH AND\r\n    ENGLISH USED--THE FRENCH REVOLUTION--MUTINY AT QUEBEC--THE\r\n    DUKE OF KENT--INVASION FEARED FROM FRANCE--MONTREAL\r\n    DISAFFECTED--ATTORNEY GENERAL MONK’S REPORT--THE FRENCH\r\n    SEDITIONARY PAMPHLETS--PANEGYRIC ON BISHOP BRIAND--MONTREAL\r\n    ARRESTS--ATTORNEY GENERAL SEWELL’S REPORT--M’LEAN--ROGER’S\r\n    SOCIETY--JEROME BONAPARTE EXPECTED.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe persistence of the English merchants had at last secured\r\nconstitutional government with an assembly. It was inaugurated\r\nby the lieutenant-governor, Sir Alured Clarke, in the absence of\r\nLord Dorchester in England, the day of its coming into effect\r\nbeing December 26, 1791. The division of the province into\r\ntwenty-one counties with four town buroughs was made later in\r\n1792, viz., Gaspé, Cornwallis, Devon, Hertford, Dorchester,\r\nBuckinghamshire, Richelieu, Bedford, Surry (sic), Kent,\r\nHuntingdon, York, Montreal, Northumberland, Orleans, Effingham,\r\nLeinster, Warwick, St. Maurice, Hampshire and Quebec. Each county\r\nreturned two members except Gaspé, Bedford and New Orleans,\r\nreturning one each. Quebec and Montreal were to return four each,\r\nThree Rivers two and William Henry (Sorel) one; in all fifty\r\nmembers.\r\n\r\nThe house met on December 17, 1792, there being about sixteen\r\nmembers of British origin, a proportion more or less maintained\r\nfor forty-six years. The Catholic members, objecting to take the\r\noath prescribed by the act of 1791, were allowed by Sir Alured\r\nClarke to take that of the act of 1774. The meeting was held in\r\nthe Bishop’s palace of Quebec hired by government and altered and\r\nrepaired at a cost of £428. Chief Justice Smith was nominated\r\nspeaker of the legislative council, the fifteen (legal number)\r\nmembers being J.G. Chaussegros de Léry, Hugh Finlay, Picotté de\r\nBelestre, Thomas Dunn, Paul Roc de St. Ours, Edward Harrison,\r\nFrançois Baby, John Collins, Joseph de Longueuil, Charles de la\r\nNaudière, George Pownal, R.A. de Boucherville, John Fraser, and\r\nSir Henry Caldwell, Receiver General, subsequently named.\r\n\r\nThe assembly met to chose a speaker. Mr. Joseph Antoine Panet,\r\na lawyer of eminence in Quebec, was appointed. Montreal was\r\nrepresented in the west ward by James McGill and J.B. Durocher\r\nand in the east ward by Joseph Frobisher and John Richardson, the\r\ncounty being represented by James Walker and Mr. Joseph Papineau.\r\nFrench and English were both used from the beginning, being\r\naccepted as a matter of course without any formal resolution.[1]\r\nThe first formal vote on the subject was taken a year later, on\r\nDecember 27, 1792, when the following motion was proposed by Mr.\r\nGrant, who accepted an amendment by Mr. Papineau “that it be an\r\ninstruction of the committee of the whole house charged with the\r\ncorrectness of the minutes (or journals) that the digest they may\r\nprepare as the journal of the house from the commencement to the\r\ntime of reference shall be in the English or French language, as\r\nit may have been entered in the original minutes without drawing\r\ninto precedent for the future.”\r\n\r\nNumber 9 of the rules for conducting the business of the assembly\r\nran:\r\n\r\n  “No motion shall be debated or put unless the same be in writing\r\n  and seconded. When a motion is seconded it shall be read in\r\n  English and French by the speaker if he is master of both\r\n  languages. If not, the speaker shall read in either of the two\r\n  languages most familiar to him and the reading in the other\r\n  language shall be at the table by the clerk or his deputy before\r\n  the debate.”\r\n\r\nOn the method of keeping the journals:\r\n\r\n  “Resolved, that this house shall keep its journal in two\r\n  registers, in one of which the proceedings of the house and the\r\n  motion shall be wrote in the French language, with a translation\r\n  of the motions originally made in the English language; and in\r\n  the other shall be entered the proceedings of the house and the\r\n  motions in the English language with a translation of the motions\r\n  originally made in the French language.”\r\n\r\nFinally it was resolved that the rules for introduction of bills\r\nshould be as follows:\r\n\r\n  “The bills relative to the criminal laws of England enforced\r\n  in this province and to the rights of the Protestant clergy as\r\n  specified in the act of the thirty-first year of His Majesty,\r\n  Chapter 31, shall be introduced in the English language; and the\r\n  bills relative to the laws, customs, usages and civil rights of\r\n  this province shall be introduced in the French language in order\r\n  to preserve the unity of the texts.”\r\n\r\nOn the 9th of May, 1793, Sir Alured Clarke in his speech from\r\nthe throne was forced to make allusions to the first French\r\nrevolution, which had been already four years in progress before\r\nthe opening of the assembly of Lower Canada in December, 1792.\r\nThe Bastille had fallen on June 17, 1789. “At the first meeting\r\nof the legislature I congratulated you,” he said, “upon the\r\nflattering prospects which opened to your view and upon the\r\nflourishing and tranquil state of the British empire, then at\r\npeace with all the world; since that period, I am sorry to find,\r\nits tranquility has been disturbed by the unjustifiable and\r\nunprecedented conduct of the persons exercising the supreme power\r\nin France, who, after deluging their own country with the blood\r\nof their own fellow citizens and embruing their hands in that\r\nof their sovereign, have forced His Majesty and the surrounding\r\nnations of Europe in a contest which involves the first interests\r\nof society.”\r\n\r\nThe king of France had been executed on January 21st and war with\r\nGreat Britain had been declared on February 1st, although Great\r\nBritain had made every effort to avoid hostility. Washington\r\nhad issued the proclamation of neutrality on April 22d, warning\r\nAmericans of the penalties incurred by its infraction. The\r\nrevolted provinces had first shown great sympathy with the French\r\nrevolutionists. On the news of the evacuation of the allied\r\nforces which began on September 20, 1793, all New England seems\r\nto have lost its head: McMaster in his “History of the People\r\nof the United States” (Vol. II, page 13-14) says: “Both men and\r\nwomen seemed for a time to have put away their wits and gone\r\nmad with republicanism. Their dress, their speech, their daily\r\nconduct were all regulated on strict republican principles.\r\nThere must be a flaming liberty cap in every house. There must\r\nbe a cockade in every hat, there must be no more use of the old\r\ntitles, Sir and Mr. and Dr. and Rev., etc.”\r\n\r\nBut later when the excesses of the Revolution began to be known\r\nexcitement somewhat cooled. It was no pleasure, consequently,\r\nto Washington to hear on the day of the proclamation of\r\nneutrality that Genet, sent as minister by the French republic,\r\nhad arrived at Charleston. Genet was well received on his way\r\nto Philadelphia, but was chilled by the reception given by\r\nWashington and left in a rage. (Archives Report, 1891, Douglas\r\nBrymner.)\r\n\r\nLower Canada was not uninfluenced by all this. Genet’s agents,\r\nor those of his successor, Fauchet, for Genet was superseded in\r\nFebruary, 1794, had succeeded in creating a disaffected spirit\r\namong people. At Quebec there was an open manifestation of\r\nsedition on the parade. Kingsford tells how Prince Edward (Duke\r\nof Kent)[2] was in command of the Seventh Fusileers at Quebec\r\nwhen a threatened mutiny was suppressed. Several were charged on\r\na plot to seize the Prince, the general and the officers. One\r\nman was sentenced to be shot, but at the Prince’s interception\r\nwas spared. Three men were severally sentenced to 500, 700 and\r\n400 lashes, one being a sergeant. The details cannot be traced.\r\n(Kingsford, Vol. VII, page 383.)\r\n\r\nA descent on Canada by way of St. John’s and Lake Champlain\r\nwas reported to be meditated by congress. In April, 1794, the\r\nauthorities of Vermont had, as reported to Lord Dorchester, made\r\nan offer to Congress to undertake the conquest of Canada without\r\nassistance from the federal government, provided the troops were\r\nallowed to plunder the inhabitants, and in order to facilitate\r\ncommunications with the seditious of Montreal, Mason lodges were\r\ninstituted in Vermont under pretended charters from lodges in\r\nMontreal.\r\n\r\nOn September 23d Dorchester arrived in Quebec; shortly Sir\r\nAlured Clarke returned to England. The second parliament was\r\nopened on November 11th. In January M. Chartier de Lothbinière\r\nsucceeded M. Panet as speaker, the latter having been made judge\r\nof Common Pleas. At the end of November, 1793, Dorchester issued\r\nproclamations to take means against the French emissaries in the\r\ncountry. In May, 1794, orders were issued for the embodiment\r\nof 2,000 militia to be ready for service. The extent of the\r\npoisonous and seditious influences at work is shown by the fact\r\nthat out of the 7,000 men fit for service in forty-two parishes\r\nonly 900 men obeyed the law. Lord Dorchester attributed this\r\nunwillingness to serve as due more to long absence from military\r\nduty than disloyalty. The habitants were, however, dissatisfied,\r\nfor though the hand of the government was easy they claimed to\r\nbe oppressed by the expenses of the law and to be unprotected\r\nagainst the exactions of their seigneurs as they had been under\r\nthe French intendants. (Dorchester to Dundas, May 24, 1794.)\r\n\r\nThe district of Montreal was reported to be universally\r\ndisaffected, though the British subjects were loyal and well\r\ndisposed. The militia law was opposed. At Côte de Neiges a party\r\nof habitants had become possessed of arms and were determined to\r\ndefend themselves if attacked. As said, information was received\r\nthat a Freemasons’ lodge had been established at Montreal in\r\nconnection with a lodge in Vermont for the sole purpose of\r\ncarrying out a traitorous correspondence with the disaffected. On\r\nall sides it was reported that the French were coming to seize\r\nCanada.\r\n\r\nAttorney General Monk, writing from Quebec to Dundas on May\r\n3, 1794, gives an alarming picture of the spread of French\r\nrevolutionary principles becoming general. He states that\r\nthreats were used by disaffected new subjects against the\r\nloyal new subjects; that it was astonishing to find the same\r\nsavagery exhibited here as in France, in so short a period for\r\ncorruption; that blood alliances did not check the menaces upon\r\nthe non-compliant peasants of burning their houses, of death,\r\nemboweling, decapitation and carrying their heads on poles; that\r\nreligion was being thrown aside. The intrigues had been traced\r\nto Genet and the French consuls; that correspondence had been\r\ncarried on between the disaffected Canadians of the United States\r\nand Canada, and that French emissaries had been sent to prepare\r\nthe people to follow the example of France.\r\n\r\nA pamphlet, extracts from which have been preserved, was\r\ncirculated in January, 1794, under the title of “les Français\r\nLibres a Leurs frères les Canadiens.” This pamphlet deserves the\r\nextracts extant being made known as indicating a picture of the\r\nfeelings of the seditionary party. They are to be found in French\r\nin the Canadian Government Archives, Q 62, page 224.\r\n\r\nThe object was to encourage the Canadians “to emulate the\r\nexample of the people of America and of France. Break then,\r\nwith a government which degenerates from day to day, and which\r\nhas become the most cruel enemy of the liberty of the people.\r\nEverywhere are found traces of the despotism, the avidity, the\r\ncruelties of the king of England. It is time to overthrow a\r\nthrone which has been seated so long on hypocrisy and imposture.\r\nIn no way fear George III with his soldiers, too small in number\r\nto successfully oppose your valour. The moment is favourable\r\nand insurrection is for you the holiest of duties. Remember\r\nthat being born French you will always be envied and persecuted\r\nby the kings of England and that this title will be more than\r\never today a reason for exclusion from all offices. Also what\r\nadvantages have you drawn from the constitution which has been\r\ngiven you since your representatives have been assembled? Have\r\nthey presented you with a single good law? Have they corrected\r\nany abuse? Have they had the power to free your commerce\r\nfrom its shackles? No! And why not? Because all the means of\r\ncorruption have been secretly and publicly employed to make\r\nthe balance weigh in favour of the English. They have dared to\r\nimpose an odious veto which the king of England has reserved\r\nonly to prevent the destruction of abuses and to paralyze all\r\nyour movements; here is the present which the vile stipendaries\r\nhave dared to offer you as a monument of the beneficence of the\r\nEnglish government. Canadians, arm yourselves. Call to your\r\nassistance your friends, the Indians; count on the help of your\r\nneighbours and on that of Frenchmen.”\r\n\r\nA resumé is given of the advantages that Canadians will obtain in\r\nthrowing over the English domination.\r\n\r\n  1. Canada will be a free and independent state.\r\n\r\n  2. It can form alliances with France and the United States.\r\n\r\n  3. The Canadians will choose their own government; they will\r\n  themselves name the members of the legislative body and the\r\n  executive power.\r\n\r\n  4. The veto will be abolished.\r\n\r\n  5. All persons who have obtained the right of citizenship in\r\n  Canada can be named for all offices.\r\n\r\n  6. The Corvées will be abolished.\r\n\r\n  7. Commerce will enjoy a more extensive liberty.\r\n\r\n  8. There will be no longer any privileged company for the fur\r\n  trade. The new government will encourage this trade.\r\n\r\n  9. The seigneurial _droits_ will be abolished. The _lods et\r\n  ventes_, the millrights, the tolls, the lumber reservations, work\r\n  for the service of the seigneur, etc., will be equally abolished.\r\n\r\n  10. Hereditary titles will be also abolished. There will be no\r\n  lords, seigneurs or nobles.\r\n\r\n  11. All cults will be free. Catholic priests named by the\r\n  people as in the primitive church will enjoy a treatment\r\n  analogous to their ability.\r\n\r\n  12. Schools will be established in the parishes and towns;\r\n  there will be printing offices; institutions for the high\r\n  sciences; medicine and mathematics. Interpreters will be trained\r\n  who, known for their good morals, will be encouraged to civilize\r\n  the savage nations and by this means to extend the trade with\r\n  them.\r\n\r\nIn spite of these inflammatory circulars, and outside those\r\nimmediately disaffected, the majority of the Canadians were in\r\ngood disposition with the government. They would have resisted\r\nan American invasion without hesitation. When their own people\r\ntampered with them and offered to regain Canada to the French\r\nit is only natural that many should have been unsettled.\r\nBut it must clearly be understood that the reports of the\r\nFrench emissaries being in the country were not the dreams of\r\nvisionaries. It was expected in many quarters that Napoleon, the\r\nFirst Consul, would have redemanded Canada at the general treaty\r\nof peace. Canada was desired for the French “as an outlet for\r\nFrench products and for the means of speculation to an infinite\r\nnumber of Frenchmen who have no resources in their own country.”\r\nThe last quotation occurs in a letter dated January 12, 1803,\r\nfrom France by an ex-Canadian, Mr. Imbert, to a brother of Judge\r\nPanet.\r\n\r\nYet a panegyric on the occasion of the death of Bishop Briand\r\nin 1794 reveals a change of opinion undergoing at this period\r\nwith regard to the relations of the English and the French.\r\n“Ah!” cried the preacher, “how the perspective of our future\r\nformerly spread out bitterness in all Christian families! Each\r\none mourned his unhappy plight and was afflicted not to be able\r\nto leave a country where the kingdom of God seemed about to be\r\nforever destroyed. No one could be persuaded that our conquerors,\r\nstrangers to our soil, to our language, our law, our customs, our\r\nworship, could ever be able to give back to Canada what it had\r\njust lost in the change of masters. Generous nation! which has\r\nmade us see with so much evidence how this prejudgment was false;\r\nindustrious nation! which has made riches sprout forth which the\r\nbosom of this land enclosed; beneficent nation! which daily gives\r\nto Canada new proofs of your liberality; No! no! you are not our\r\nenemies, nor those of our properties which your laws protect,\r\nnor those of our religion, which you respect. Pardon this first\r\nmistrust in a people which had not yet the honour of knowing you.”\r\n\r\nAt Montreal some important arrests were made; one, Duclos,\r\nan active agent of the United States who had moved among the\r\npeople confidently foretelling the invasion of the French, and\r\na traitor named Costello, who was proved to have been diligent\r\nin circulating the incendiary pamphlets in French. To meet this\r\ndisaffection Constitutional Associations were formed in Montreal\r\nand Quebec of the leading French Canadian and British loyalists.\r\nGradually the sedition died down. But during the great fear of a\r\nFrench invasion there had been no little doubt and uncertainty\r\namong the mercantile classes as to the fate of the vessels that\r\nmight be dispatched with cargoes on the St. Lawrence. Jay’s\r\ntreaty, 19th of November, 1794, with Great Britain, for the\r\namicable adjustment of all differences between it and the United\r\nStates, was a potent factor in making for peace. It was finally\r\nagreed to in the senate of the United States in 1795, although\r\nthe sympathizers of the French fought it determinedly.\r\n\r\nIn April, 1796, Dorchester, who had sent in his resignation,\r\nreceived official information that Gen. Robert Prescott\r\nhad been appointed lieutenant governor of Lower Canada and\r\ncommander-in-chief in North America. Prescott arrived at Quebec\r\non the 18th of June and Dorchester sailed in July, being wrecked\r\non the island of Anticosti, but, being taken off by a ship of\r\nwar, reached his destination in safety. On the 18th of June,\r\n1796, Sir Robert Prescott, Lord Dorchester’s successor, did\r\nnot find matters in the province in a satisfactory state. The\r\nFrench republican designs on Canada were still represented in the\r\nMontreal district by many sympathizers. Riots were caused and the\r\nmagistrates of Montreal seemed to have acted weakly, if not with\r\nconnivance, so that a new commission of the peace was issued with\r\nseveral names omitted. The ostensible cause was opposition to the\r\nexecution of the Road Bill, but in reality it was a disaffection\r\nstirred up by emissaries from the French republic, then in the\r\nprovince.\r\n\r\nAttorney General Sewell had been sent to Montreal to get\r\ninformation and he reported the above to the executive council at\r\nQuebec on Sunday, October 30, 1796, on the authority of Messrs.\r\nde Lothbinière, McGill, Richardson, Murray, Papineau and others.\r\nHe reported: “That a pamphlet of most seditious tendencies,\r\nsigned by Adet, the embassador from the French republic to the\r\nUnited States, was now in circulation in the district. That\r\nthis pamphlet bore the arms of the French republic and was\r\naddressed to the Canadians assuring them that France, having now\r\nconquered Spain, Austria and Italy, had determined to subdue\r\nGreat Britain and meant to begin with her colonies; that she\r\nthought it her duty in the first instance to turn her attention\r\nto the Canadians, to relieve them from the slavery under which\r\nthey groaned, and was taking steps for that purpose; that it\r\npointed out the supposed advantages which the republican form\r\nof government possessed over the British and concluded that\r\nin a short time there would only be heard the cry of ‘Vive la\r\nRepublique!’ from Canada to Paris.” The attorney-general added\r\nthat he had heard at Montreal that the French republic intended\r\nto raise troops in Canada and had actually sent four officers’\r\ncommissions into the country. This brought a proclamation from\r\nLieutenant-Governor Prescott, commander-in-chief, ordering the\r\narrest of seditious persons, especially “certain foreigners being\r\nalien enemies who are lurking and lying concealed in various\r\nparts of the province.” This proclamation was ordered to be\r\npublished for three successive weeks in the Quebec Gazette and\r\nMontreal papers in both languages, and also copies to be printed\r\nto be affixed to the church doors in the province. During the\r\nrest of the year various people were examined in Montreal, which\r\nrevealed the existence of a widespread revolt organized by\r\nagitators.\r\n\r\nOn May 17th at the recent assizes for the district of Quebec and\r\nMontreal a number had been arrested and tried. Attorney-General\r\nSewell in his report to Prescott on May 12, 1797, mentions among\r\nthe several indictments preferred the following:\r\n\r\n  “High Treason: Inciting persons to assemble in a riotous manner\r\n  for the purpose of opposing the execution of the Road Act;\r\n  Conspiracy to prevent the market of Montreal being supplied with\r\n  Provisions until the inhabitants of that city should unite with\r\n  those of the Country in their opposition to the Road Act.\r\n\r\n  “Assault on a Constable in the execution of his office under the\r\n  Road Act.\r\n\r\n  “Riot and assault on a justice of the peace in the execution of\r\n  his Office.\r\n\r\n  “Riots, assaults on and false Imprisonment of different overseers\r\n  of the High Roads.\r\n\r\n  “Riots and Rescue of Persons apprehended for the offence last\r\n  above mentioned from the hands of the sheriff’s officers. Assault\r\n  on the sheriff of Montreal in the execution of his Office and\r\n  Rescue of a Prisoner from his custody for an offence against\r\n  Government.\r\n\r\n  “Seditious Conversation and Libels on the House of Assembly.\r\n\r\n  “The number of Persons indicted in Montreal for the above\r\n  offences amounted in all to nineteen, of which four for High\r\n  Treason have not yet been tried. Thirteen were tried and of that\r\n  number eleven were convicted and received Judgment. The remaining\r\n  Two absconded.\r\n\r\n  “The number of persons indicted at Quebec for the above offences\r\n  amounted to twenty-four, of which twenty-three were convicted and\r\n  received punishment.”\r\n\r\nIt is needless to review these cases. As, however, the name of\r\nMcLean stands out in this sedition, he must be noticed. This man\r\nwas not arrested till May 10, 1797, although information of his\r\nseditionary mission work on the borders of Canada and the United\r\nStates was in the hands of the authorities in December, 1796. On\r\nJuly 7th he was tried and found guilty and executed on the 21st.\r\nOn various occasions he had been known to be in Montreal planting\r\nsedition. He was in close touch with Ira Allen, of Vermont, who\r\nhad been on board the “Olive Branch” from Ostend with 20,000\r\nstand of arms. He tried to explain that these were purchased\r\nfor the Vermont militia. But there is no doubt that they were\r\nfurnished by the Directory in Paris for the army of the Lower\r\nCanadians in an expedition in which McLean was to be interested.\r\nAmong McLean’s papers was found one from Adet confirming this.\r\n\r\nThe attempts of the French on Canada already mentioned under the\r\ndates of 1796 and 1797 seemed never to have entirely relaxed. In\r\n1801 Lieutenant-Governor Milnes became warned that persons were\r\nplotting for the subversion of Canada and that a society of “a\r\nparcel of Americans” had been formed in Montreal, proceeding on\r\nthe principles of Jacobinism and Illuminism, having one Rogers\r\nas leader, it being supposed that he was the only one who knew\r\nthe real objects of the society, which had increased from six\r\nto sixty-one members. Six were arrested and held for trial but\r\nRogers escaped. Attorney-General Sewell made a report of his\r\ninvestigation. Rogers was a New England schoolmaster who had\r\nsettled a short time before at Carillon, forty miles west of\r\nMontreal. The society formed by him was composed “of sundry\r\nindividuals of desperate fortunes,” and among them were many of\r\nthe persons concerned in McLane’s (sic) conspiracy, particularly\r\nIra Allen and Stephen Thorn, who were lately arrived from France.\r\nThe pretext on which Rogers founded his society was to search for\r\ntreasure. The depositions accompanying Sewell’s report implicate\r\nIra Allen and his Vermont marauders as bent on plundering Canada.\r\nIn this regard Montreal was especially aimed at. The trouble died\r\ndown somewhat in 1802 when peace with France was proclaimed,\r\nbut on June 1, 1803, long before any steps could be taken after\r\nthe declaration of war again, French emissaries were in the\r\nprovince sapping the loyalty, some of them being in Montreal.\r\nAgain, this was no visionary conception, but a reality. A keen\r\nlookout was maintained on strangers. Mr. Richardson, a magistrate\r\nof Montreal, was appointed secret agent. One of those to be\r\nwatched was Jerome Bonaparte, the brother of the First Consul\r\nof France. His description is as follows, as sent by Barclay\r\nfrom New York, 2d December, 1803, to Milnes: “Jerome Bonaparte\r\nappears about twenty-one years of age, five feet, six or seven\r\ninches high, slender make, sallow complexion, sharp and prominent\r\nchin, cropped dark hair, short, but he sometimes adds a queue\r\nand is powdered; dark eyes.” Jerome had arrived at New York\r\nabout November 20th and was reported to be making, via Albany,\r\nfor Lake Champlain, where there was “a Frenchman named Rous, who\r\nis notorious for assisting deserters. McLean, hung for treason,\r\nis particularly intimate with Rous.” Richardson came to terms\r\nwith this Rous, whom he employed as a spy. The attempt on Canada\r\nby the French was temporarily abandoned, the reason, given by\r\nPichon, Chargé d’affaires at Washington, being that Great Britain\r\nwas too powerful by sea.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[1] One of the first statutes was an act to prevent gun powder\r\ndrawn in ships and other vessels into the harbour of Montreal and\r\nto guard against the careless transportation of the same into the\r\npowder magazines.\r\n\r\n[2] He landed at Quebec in August, 1791, and left Canada in\r\n1794. On the 13th of September, in passing through Montreal, he\r\nreceived a complimentary address. He went up country probably\r\nas far as Niagara, returning through Montreal in September of\r\n1792. On December 6, 1793, Chief Justice Smith died at Quebec.\r\nHis remains were interred on December 8th, and were attended to\r\nthe grave by H.R.H. Prince Edward.--(Quebec Gazette, Thursday,\r\nDecember 12, 1793.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                          CHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\n                  THE AMERICAN INVASION OF 1812\r\n\r\n                    MONTREAL AND CHATEAUGUAY\r\n\r\n                     FRENCH CANADIAN LOYALTY\r\n\r\n  THE CAUSES OF THE WAR OF 1812--THE CHESAPEAKE--JOHN HENRY--HOW\r\n    THE NEWS OF INVASION WAS RECEIVED IN MONTREAL--THE\r\n    MOBILIZATION--GENERAL HULL--THE MONTREAL MILITIA--FRENCH AND\r\n    ENGLISH ENLIST--MONTREAL THE OBJECTIVE--OFFICIAL ACCOUNT OF\r\n    THE BATTLE OF CHATEAUGUAY--COLONEL DE SALABERRY--RETURN OF\r\n    WOUNDED--THE EXPLANATION OF THE FEW BRITISH KILLED.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe loyalty of the British and French Canadians was again to be\r\ntested during the American war of 1812, which involved Canada in\r\nwar as a dependency of England.\r\n\r\nIts causes were as follows: In 1806, on November 1st, Napoleon\r\nissued his “Berlin decree” declaring a blockade on the entire\r\nBritish coast, and let loose French privateers against her\r\nshipping and that of neutral nations trading with her. Great\r\nBritain retaliated by the celebrated “orders in council which\r\ndeclared all traffic with France contraband and the vessels\r\nprosecuting it with their cargoes, liable to seizure.”[1] By both\r\nof these the United States was injured in its carrying trade.\r\nCongress, therefore, in the following year superceded President\r\nJefferson’s contra-embargo on all shipping, domestic and foreign,\r\nin the harbours of the United States, by a “non-intercourse\r\nact” prohibiting all commerce with either belligerent till the\r\n“obnoxious decree” or “orders” were removed.\r\n\r\nAnother cause conspired to fan the war feeling to a flame. Great\r\nBritain, pressed by the difficulty of manning her immense fleets,\r\nasserted the “right of search” of American vessels for deserters\r\nfrom her navy. The United States frigate “Chesapeake” resisted\r\nthis right, sanctioned by international law, but was compelled by\r\na broadside from H.M. Ship Leopard (June, 1807) to submit. The\r\nBritish government disavowed the violence of this act and offered\r\nreparation. But the democratic party was clamorous for war and\r\neager to seduce from their allegiance and annex to the United\r\nStates, the provinces of British North America.\r\n\r\nA further cause exasperating the United States, was the\r\npublication of the secret correspondence of a Captain Henry,\r\nan adventurer, sent by Sir James Craig, Governor General of\r\nCanada, in 1809 to ascertain the state of feeling in New England\r\ntowards Great Britain. Henry reported a disposition to secede\r\nfrom the Union and subsequently offered his correspondence to\r\nthe American government, demanding therefor the exorbitant sum\r\nof $50,000, which he received from the secret service fund.\r\nHis information was authentic but unimportant and the British\r\ngovernment repudiated his agency, but the war party in Congress\r\nwas implacable.\r\n\r\nThis John Henry had lived as a boy in Montreal, after which he\r\ncrossed the border. In 1807 he applied through merchants in\r\nMontreal for the office of puisné judge in Upper Canada, it\r\nappearing that he had obtained the favour of the merchants of\r\nMontreal by defending their conduct in a party newspaper. His\r\ncorrespondence (1808-9) with Sir J. Craig while on his mission,\r\nreveals that for some time in April, 1808, Henry was in Montreal.\r\n\r\nOn June 18, 1812, James Madison, the president, and Congress\r\napproved the “act declaring war between the United Kingdom of\r\nGreat Britain and Ireland and the dependencies thereof and the\r\nUnited States of America and their territories.” This news,\r\nsent by an express of the North West Company, did not reach the\r\ngovernor, Sir John Prevost, till July 7th. It had, however, been\r\nsent by private means to General Brock in Upper Canada about June\r\n26th by the Hon. John Richardson of Montreal, though others say\r\nby John Jacob Astor, who had extensive fur interests in Canada.\r\n\r\nHow the news of the war was received in Montreal has been\r\npublished recently in the Huntingdon “Gleaner” (under the\r\neditorship of Mr. Robert Sellar). The late Mr. Lewis MacKay of\r\nHuntingdon, then twenty-one years of age, there relates what\r\nhe saw as an eye witness. “I recollect very well the day when\r\nword reached Montreal that the American government had declared\r\nwar against Britain. It caused great dejection, for the general\r\nbelief was that the Americans would come at once and take Canada.\r\nAt night especially, there was great alarm. Everything in the\r\nshape of a man was pressed into service. If dogs could have\r\ncarried firelocks they would have been taken. I saw at the sentry\r\nposts mere boys too weak to carry their guns which they rested\r\nagainst their bases.”\r\n\r\nQuickly the militia and military were organized. Colonel Baynes,\r\nadjutant general, writing to Brock from Quebec on July 3d, says:\r\n“The flank companies here are on the march and 2,000 militia will\r\nform a chain of posts from St. John’s to La Prairie. The town\r\nmilitia of Montreal and Quebec to the number of 3,000 from each\r\ncity have volunteered, and are being embodied and drilled, and\r\nwill take their part in garrison duty to relieve the troops. The\r\nproclamation for declaring martial law is prepared and will be\r\nspeedily issued. All aliens will be required to take the oath of\r\nallegiance or immediately quit the Province.”\r\n\r\nWriting from Montreal on August 17th, Sir George Prevost wrote to\r\nLord Bathurst, secretary of war: “A part of the Forty-ninth\r\nRegiment has already proceeded from Montreal to Kingston and\r\nhas been followed by the remainder of the Newfoundland Regiment\r\nof some picked Veterans; the other companies of the Forty-ninth\r\nRegiment will proceed to the same destination as soon as\r\nsufficient number of bateaux can be collected. * * * From\r\nKingston to Montreal the Frontier line appears at present secure.\r\n* * * The Eighth or King’s Regiment has arrived this M(ornin)g\r\nfrom Quebec to relieve the Forty-ninth Regiment. This fine and\r\neffective Regt. of the Eighth, together with a Chain of Troops\r\nestablished in the vicinity of this place, consisting of regular\r\nand militia Forces, the whole amounting to near four thousand,\r\nfive hundred men, effectually serve to keep in check the enemy\r\nin this quarter where alone they are in any strength and to\r\nprevent any Attempt to carry on a Predatory Warfare against this\r\nflourishing portion of Lower Canada.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MONTREAL IN 1810 A view of the city of Montreal\r\nand the river St. Lawrence from the mountain, by E. Walsh,\r\nForty-ninth Regiment, 1810.]\r\n\r\nBrock made preparations to meet the American general, William\r\nHull, who was early in July descending on Canada from Detroit. He\r\nhad soon to return in hot haste and on August 16th surrendered\r\nDetroit to Sir Isaac Brock.[2] Brock paroled many of the\r\nprisoners but the rest he sent to Montreal on their way to Quebec\r\nfor embarkation. The Montreal Herald of Tuesday, September 12,\r\n1812, facetiously describes their entry thus:\r\n\r\n“Montreal, September 12th.\r\n\r\n“Last Sunday evening the inhabitants of this city were gratified\r\nwith an exhibition equally novel and interesting. That General\r\nHull should have entered our city so soon at the head of his\r\ntroops rather exceeded our expectations. We were, however, happy\r\nto see him and received him with all the honours due to his rank\r\nand importance as a public character. The following particulars\r\nrelative to his journey and reception at Montreal may not be\r\nuninteresting to our readers.\r\n\r\n“General Hull and suite, accompanied by about twenty-five\r\nofficers and three hundred and fifty soldiers, left Kingston\r\nunder an escort of 130 men commanded by Major Heathcote of the\r\nNewfoundland Regiment. At Cornwall the escort was met by Captain\r\nGray of the quartermaster general’s department who took charge\r\nof the prisoners of war and from thence proceeded with them to\r\nLachine, where they arrived about 2 o’clock on Sunday afternoon.\r\nAt Lachine Captains Richardson and Ogilvie, with their companies\r\nof Montreal militia and a company of the King’s, commanded by\r\nCaptain Blackmore formed the escort till they were met by Colonel\r\nAuldjo with the remainder of the flank companies of the militia,\r\nupon which Captain Blackmore’s Company fell out and presented\r\narms as the general passed with the others, and then returned\r\nto Lachine, leaving the prisoners to be guarded by the Montreal\r\nmilitia alone.” Then follows the order of march in procession\r\ninto the town through the illuminated streets to the Château de\r\nRamezay:\r\n\r\n“When they arrived at the governor’s house the general was\r\nconducted in and presented to his Excellency, Sir George Prevost.\r\nHe was received with the greatest politeness and invited to take\r\nup his residence there during his stay in Montreal. The officers\r\nwere quartered in Holmes Hotel and the soldiers were marched to\r\nQuebec Gate Barracks. The general appears to be about sixty years\r\nof age and bears his misfortune with a degree of resignation that\r\nbut few men in similar circumstances are fitted with.”\r\n\r\nGeneral Hull was exchanged for thirty British soldiers taken by\r\nthe Americans. The rest of the prisoners proceeded to Quebec.[3]\r\n\r\nMontrealers were elated at Hull’s capture, but they knew well\r\nthat revenge was being prepared. Montreal was still the objective\r\nof the congress army as of old. Their secretary of state had said\r\nthat “Montreal was the apple of his eye. Why waste men and money\r\nupon distant frontiers? Strike at their vitals, then you will\r\nparalyze their extremities. Capture Montreal and you will starve\r\nde Rottenburg and Proctor. In Montreal your troops will find\r\nwinter quarters and an English Christmas.”\r\n\r\nThe Montreal militia, therefore, had to keep up their drill in\r\nearnest. On November 19th there was a call to arms on a report\r\nthe city was to be attacked. The militia left the city to meet\r\nthe foe, but on November 28th returned from “their pleasure trip”\r\nunscathed, for either the enemy had disappeared or it was a false\r\nalarm.\r\n\r\nBut it was not only volunteers for the militia that were being\r\nrequired. Men were wanted for the front. Lewis MacKay describes\r\nhow Colonel McDonell (or Macdonnell) of Glengarry (who was\r\nafterwards mortally wounded and whose remains were buried beside\r\nthose of Brock) came to Montreal to enlist men for his regiment.\r\n“The men he brought with him were mostly from Glengarry. As I\r\nspoke Gaelic I got amongst them. I enlisted with them, but on\r\nexamination was rejected because I was not up to the standard in\r\nheight. I was transferred to the Voltigeurs. There was nothing\r\ndoing in Montreal but raising troops of cavalry and regiments,\r\nand they took everybody that offered, almost. The bounty was\r\n$100, but the pay was very small. There were French among the\r\nGlengarries and there were old country men in the Voltigeurs.\r\n* * * Among others in Montreal was Captain Coleman of the Eighth\r\nDragoons. He got liberty to raise a troop for himself. He was\r\nrich and bought horses with his own money and men were keen\r\nto enlist with him. Wanting me as his body servant he got me\r\ntransferred from the Voltigeurs. When he had got his complement\r\nof men the government did the rest, giving uniforms, saddles,\r\narms, etc. The troop got the name of the ‘French Troop’ and were\r\nordered to Upper Canada.”\r\n\r\nThe enthusiastic readiness of the French Canadians to protect\r\ntheir country and the _camaraderie_ with which the different\r\nsubjects, old and new, now joined side by side, are also\r\nevidenced in glancing at the lists of militia records of the\r\ntimes. A picture is preserved by Dunlop of the good times of\r\nthe two corps “formed of the gentlemen of Montreal,” of whom\r\nhe says, “that if their discipline was commendable their\r\ncommissariat was beyond all praise. Long lines of carts were to\r\nbe seen bearing in casks and hampers of the choicest wines, to\r\nsay nothing of the venison, turkeys, hams and all other esculents\r\nnecessary to recruit their strength under the fatigues of war.\r\nWith them the Indian found a profitable market for his game, and\r\nthe fisherman for his fish. There can be little doubt that a\r\ngourmand would greatly prefer the comfort of dining with a mess\r\nof privates of these distinguished corps to the honour and glory\r\nof being half starved (of which he ran no small risk) at the\r\ntable of the Governor-General himself.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LETTER OF DE LORIMIER (1812) A call to arms]\r\n\r\nWhile, therefore, the struggle was in the Upper Province, the\r\nattack on Montreal was, however, reserved for the next year\r\nand the Montreal militia, with men like Lieut. Col. Charles\r\nde Salaberry, Lieutenant McDonell, Captains Jean Baptiste and\r\nJucherau Duchesnay, Daly and Ferguson, Bruyère and la Motte,\r\nwith adjutants O’Sullivan and Hedder--all to be mentioned in\r\ndespatches--were to give the Americans no cause to doubt either\r\nBritish or French Canadian loyalty to the British flag.\r\n\r\nThe chance came to save Montreal in 1813, on October 21st, when\r\nthe militia battalions of Montreal and the district took the\r\nfield at Chateauguay to prevent the advance on the city by the\r\nAmerican army under General Hampton. It was a glorious victory\r\nfor the militia.\r\n\r\nThe attack on Montreal was planned by Major-General Wilkinson,\r\nwho had arrived about the end of August, 1813, in Sacketts\r\nHarbour to take charge of the troops of the North American\r\nfrontier. There in his council of officers it was determined: “To\r\nrendezvous the whole of the troops on the lake in the vicinity[4]\r\nand in cooperation with our squadron to make a bold feint upon\r\nKingston; step down the St. Lawrence; lock up the enemy in our\r\nrear to starve or surrender; or oblige him to follow us without\r\nartillery, baggage or provisions, or eventually to lay down his\r\narms; to sweep the St. Lawrence of armed craft; and in concert\r\nwith the division of Major-General Hampton to take Montreal.”[5]\r\n\r\nMontreal was therefore the main object of attack. “Montreal is\r\nthe safer and greater object,” wrote Armstrong to the Secretary\r\nof War, fearing hard blows at Kingston, the weaker place, “and\r\nyou will find there a small force to encounter.” Montreal offered\r\nno terrors for there were “no fortifications at that city, or\r\nin advance of it,” and only “200 sailors and 400 marines with\r\nthe militia, number unknown,” but there were, to be sure, “2,500\r\nregular troops expected daily from Quebec.”\r\n\r\nYet the American force which made its way under Major-General\r\nHampton from Burlington was a powerful army. It arrived on\r\nOctober 8th at Chateauguay Four Corners, a small settlement\r\ndistant five miles from the national boundary, about forty-six\r\nfrom Montreal, and about forty-five from the proposed junction of\r\nHampton’s force with Major-General Wilkinson’s.\r\n\r\nWilliam James, who published in London in 1818, “a full and\r\ncorrect account of the military occurrences of the late war\r\nbetween Great Britain and the United States of America,” says\r\nof General Hampton’s force, now prepared against Montreal, that\r\nit “has been stated at 7,000 infantry and 200 cavalry,” but we\r\nhave no American authority for supposing that the latter exceeded\r\n180 or the former 5,520, making a total of 5,700 men accompanied\r\nby ten pieces of cannon. This army, except the small militia\r\nforce attached to it, was the same that, with General Dearborn at\r\nits head, paraded across the line and back to Plattsburg in the\r\nautumn of 1812. During the twelve months that had since elapsed,\r\nthe men had been drilled under an officer, Major-General Izard,\r\nwho had served one or two campaigns in the French army. Troops\r\nwere all in uniform, well clothed and equipped; in short, General\r\nHampton commanded, if not the most numerous, certainly the most\r\neffective regular army which the United States were able to send\r\ninto the field during the war.\r\n\r\nAt Montreal there was bustle and stir in getting the additional\r\nforces out which were to join Lieutenant-Colonel Salaberry of\r\nthe Canadian Fencibles, who commenced operations to check the\r\nAmerican advance as soon as he had learned that the Americans\r\nhad crossed the lines. But the whole of the force that went to\r\nmeet Hampton between October 21st and 29th was only about eight\r\nhundred rank and file, with 172 Indians under Captain Lamotte at\r\nthe settlements of Chateauguay. The battle of Chateauguay and its\r\nresults may now be told by Sir George Prevost in his dispatch\r\nfrom Montreal to Earl Bathurst.\r\n\r\n                    “Headquarters, Montreal, October 30, 1813.\r\n\r\n  “My Lord:\r\n\r\n  “On the 8th instant I had the honour to report to Your Lordship\r\n  that Major-General Hampton had occupied with a considerable force\r\n  of regulars and militia a portion of the Chateauguay River,\r\n  near the settlement of the Four Corners. Early on the 21st the\r\n  American army crossed the line of separation between Lower Canada\r\n  and the United States, surprised the small party of Indian\r\n  warriors and drove in a picket of sedentary militia posted at the\r\n  junction of the Outard and Chateauguay Rivers, where it encamped,\r\n  and proceeded in establishing a road of communication with its\r\n  last position for the purpose of bringing forward its artillery.\r\n  Major-General Hampton having completed his arrangements on the\r\n  24th, commenced on the following day his operations against my\r\n  advanced posts. At about 11 o’clock in the forenoon of the 26th\r\n  his cavalry and light troops were discovered advancing on both\r\n  banks of the Chateauguay by a detachment covering a working\r\n  party of habitants employed in felling timber for the purpose\r\n  of constructing _abattis_.[6] Lieutenant-Colonel de Saluberry\r\n  (sic), who had the command of the advanced piquets composed of\r\n  the light infantry company of the Canadian Fencibles and two\r\n  companies of Voltigeurs on the north side of the river, made so\r\n  excellent a disposition of his little band that he checked the\r\n  advance of the enemy’s principal column led by Major-General\r\n  Hampton in person and accompanied by Brigadier-General Izard;\r\n  while the American Light Brigade under Colonel McCarty was in\r\n  like manner repulsed in its progress on the south side of the\r\n  river by the spirited advance of the right flank company of the\r\n  Third Battalion of the embodied militia under Captain Daly,\r\n  supported by Captain Bruyer’s Company of Chateauguay Chasseurs;\r\n  Captains Daly and Bruyers being both wounded and their companies\r\n  having sustained some loss, their position was immediately\r\n  taken up by a flank company of the first battalion of embodied\r\n  militia; the enemy rallied and repeatedly returned to the attack,\r\n  which terminated only with the day in his complete disgrace and\r\n  defeat; being foiled at all points by a handful of men who, by\r\n  their determined bravery, maintained their position and screened\r\n  from insult the working parties who continued their labours\r\n  unconcerned. Having fortunately arrived at the scene of action\r\n  shortly after its commencement, I witnessed the conduct of the\r\n  troops on this glorious occasion, and it was a great satisfaction\r\n  to me to render on the spot that praise which had become so\r\n  justly their due. I thanked Major-General De Watteville for the\r\n  wise measures taken by him for the defense of this position and\r\n  lieutenant-Colonel de Saluberry for the judgment displayed by him\r\n  in the choice of his ground and the bravery and skill with which\r\n  he maintained it; I acknowledged the highest praise to belong to\r\n  the officers and men engaged that morning for their gallantry\r\n  and readiness, and I called upon all the troops in advance as\r\n  well for a continuance of that zeal, steadiness and discipline as\r\n  for that patient endurance of hardship and privations which they\r\n  hitherto evinced; and I particularly noticed the able support\r\n  lieutenant-Colonel de Saluberry received from Captain Ferguson in\r\n  command of the Canadian Fencibles and from Capt. J.B. Duchesnay\r\n  and Capt. J. Duchesnay and adjutant Hedder, of the Voltigeurs,\r\n  and also from adjutant O’Sullivan of the sedentary militia and\r\n  from Captain La Motte, belonging to the Indian warriors.\r\n\r\n  “Almost the whole of the British troops being pushed forward for\r\n  the defence of Upper Canada, that of the lower province must\r\n  depend in a great degree on the valour and continued exertion\r\n  of its incorporated battalions and its sedentary militia until\r\n  the Seventieth Regiment and the two battalions of marines daily\r\n  expected should arrive.\r\n\r\n  “It is therefore highly satisfactory to state to Your Lordship\r\n  that there appears a determination among all classes of His\r\n  Majesty’s Canadian subjects to persevere in a loyal and\r\n  honourable line of conduct. By a report of the prisoners taken\r\n  from the enemy in the affair on the Chateauguay, the American\r\n  force is stated at 7,000 infantry and 200 cavalry, with 10 field\r\n  pieces. The British advanced force actually engaged did not\r\n  exceed 300. The enemy suffered severely from our fire and from\r\n  their own; some detached corps in the woods fired on each other.\r\n\r\n  “I have the honour to transmit to your Lordship a return of\r\n  the killed and wounded on the 26th. I avail myself of this\r\n  opportunity to solicit from his royal highness, the prince\r\n  regent, as a mark of his gracious approbation of the conduct of\r\n  the embodied battalions of the Canadian Militia five pair of\r\n  colours for the first, second, third, fourth and fifth battalions.\r\n\r\n              “I have the honour to be, etc.,\r\n                                                “GEORGE PREVOST.\r\n\r\n“Return of killed, wounded and missing of his Majesty’s forces in\r\nthe action of the enemy in the advance on Chateauguay on the 26th\r\nof October, 1813.\r\n\r\n  “Canadian fencible infantry, light Company; three rank and file\r\n    killed; one sergeant, three rank and file wounded.\r\n\r\n  “Third battalion embodied militia, flank company; two rank and\r\n    file killed; one captain, six rank and file wounded; four rank\r\n    and file missing.\r\n\r\n  “Chateauguay Chasseurs; one captain wounded.\r\n\r\n  “Total: Five rank and file killed, two captains, one sergeant,\r\n    thirteen rank and file wounded; four rank and file missing.\r\n\r\n  “Names of officers wounded: Third battalion embodied\r\n    militia--Captain Daly twice wounded, severely. Chateauguay\r\n    Chasseurs: Captain Bruyers, slightly.\r\n\r\n                           “EDWARD BAYNES, Adjutant-General.\r\n\r\n  Right Hon. Earl Bathurst.”\r\n\r\nThe slight number of the British forces opposed to the Americans\r\ncould hardly be believed after the disorganization of the\r\nlatter. When Captain Debartzch of the militia was sent to the\r\nheadquarters of General Hampton with a flag and announced the\r\nnumber of the opposing force, Hampton, scarcely able to keep his\r\ntemper, insisted that the British force amounted to 7,000 men for\r\nhe asked, “What, then, made the woods ring with rifles?”\r\n\r\nThis incident must be told. In the early course of the fight the\r\nAmericans opened a spirited fight upon the Canadians and drove\r\nthe skirmishers stationed near the left behind the front edge\r\nof the _abattis_. “The Americans,” says William James, already\r\nquoted, “Although they did not occupy one foot of the abattis nor\r\nlieutenant-colonel de Saluberry retire one inch from the ground\r\non which he had been standing, celebrated this partial retiring\r\nas a retreat. They were not a little surprised, however, to hear\r\ntheir Huzzas repeated by the Canadians, accompanied by a noise\r\nten times more terrific than even ‘Colonel Boerstler’s stentorian\r\nvoice.’ By way of animating his little band when thus momentarily\r\npressed, colonel de Saluberry ordered his bugle men to sound the\r\nadvance. This was heard by lieutenant-colonel McDonell, who,\r\nthinking that the colonel was in want of support, caused his\r\nown bugler to answer, and immediately advanced with two of his\r\ncompanies. He at the same time sent ten or twelve bugle men into\r\nthe adjoining woods with orders to separate and blow with all\r\ntheir might. This little _ruse de guerre_ led the Americans to\r\nbelieve that they had more thousands than hundreds to contend\r\nwith and deterred them from even attempting to penetrate the\r\n_abattis_. They contented themselves with a long shot warfare in\r\nwhich, from the nature of the defences, they were almost the only\r\nsufferers.”\r\n\r\nThe Americans, after bungling the battle, delayed at Four\r\nCorners, but on November 11th Hampton, feeling himself unsafe,\r\nbroke up his encampment and retreated to Plattsburg.\r\n\r\nChateauguay had served Montreal well and the tide of war again\r\nrolled away from its gates.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[1] Cf. Withrow “History of Canada,” pp. 301-302.\r\n\r\n[2] William Hull was born in Derby, Connecticut, on June 24,\r\n1753. He graduated with honors from Yale at the age of nineteen,\r\nstudied law and was admitted to practice. He allied himself with\r\nthe Revolutionary party and obtained a commission from Congress\r\neventually rising to the rank of a colonel. At the conclusion\r\nof peace he held a judicial office in Massachusetts and served\r\nfor eight years as a senator. In 1805 he was appointed the first\r\ngovernor of the territory of Michigan and was commissioned a\r\nbrigadier general in the army of the United States on April 8,\r\n1812. He was court-martialed for his surrender of Detroit in 1814\r\nand after a trial of three months he was ordered to be shot,\r\nbut President Madison remitted his sentence in consideration of\r\nhis services in the Revolutionary war. His name was, however,\r\ndropped from the army lists. He died at Newton, Massachusetts, in\r\nNovember, 1825.\r\n\r\n[3] Their arrival at Quebec is thus described by A.W. Cochran,\r\nassistant civil secretary to the governor general in a letter\r\nto his mother: “Both men and officers are a shabby looking set\r\nas ever you set your eyes on, and reminded me of Falstaff’s men\r\nvery forcibly. Some of the officers talked very big and assured\r\nus that before long there would be 100,000 men in Canada and\r\nthat they soon would have Quebec from us.” Later on, writing to\r\nhis father from Montreal on October 10th he further expresses\r\nhis views on the Americans: “The Americans, I think, bid fair\r\nto rival and surpass the French in gasconading as well as in\r\neverything that is dishonorable, base and contemptible. * * *\r\nYankees cannot tell a plain story like other folks; they cannot\r\nhelp ‘immersing the wig in the ocean’ as Sterne says of the\r\nFrenchmen.”\r\n\r\n[4] The spot chosen was Grenadier Island, eighteen miles from\r\nSacketts Harbour.\r\n\r\n[5] “Wilkinson’s Memoirs,” Vol. III, Appendix No. 1.\r\n\r\n[6] Abattis.

His previous address\r\nto the public announced that the subscription was to be two and\r\na half Spanish dollars per annum. Subscribers would pay one\r\nSpanish dollar for every advertisement inserted in the said paper\r\nduring three weeks successively, non-subscribers one and one-half\r\nSpanish dollars, and the paper was to be a quarter sheet. The\r\nfirst number was rather literary than commercial. Advertisements\r\ncame with the second number. Jean Bernard exhorts the public not\r\nto throw their wood-fuel ashes away. He would buy them at ten\r\ncoppers a bushel. In number four occurs the advertisement: “Ran\r\naway on the 14th instant, a slave belonging to the widow Dufy\r\nDesaulnier, aged about thirty-five years, dressed in striped\r\ncalico, of medium height and tolerable stoutness. Whoever will\r\nbring her back will receive a reward of $6, and will be repaid\r\nany costs that may be proved to have been incurred in finding\r\nher.”\r\n\r\nThe Gazette du Commerce did not realize its name for some time,\r\nthere being in the small community a dearth of such, as Mesplet\r\ndeplored in the first paragraph of No. 1. Very little political\r\nnews ever filtered through the Gazette, but the arrival and\r\ndeparture of governors was safe; consequently he printed the\r\naddress of Colonel Sevestre commanding the militia at Montreal\r\nto Sir Guy Carleton, who finished his term of office in July,\r\n1778; and the reply commending the virtues and experience of his\r\nsuccessor, General Haldimand.\r\n\r\nThe issue of August 12, 1778, records the latter’s visit thus:\r\n\r\n“On the 8th instant at 6 P.M. General Haldimand made his entrance\r\ninto the town amid discharges of artillery from the citadel\r\nand the vessels in the harbour. The English merchants were in\r\nthe front, followed by the Canadian Militia and the regulars,\r\nthe whole forming a line from the Quebec gate to the Company’s\r\nhouse, where His Excellency now resides. A band of 600 Indians,\r\nwith Messrs. St. Luc de la Corne and Campbell, their officers\r\nand interpreters at the head, came out of the town and welcomed\r\nthe new Governor with cries which proclaimed the joy they felt\r\nat his arrival. The citizens of the two nations proved their\r\ngratification by their enthusiasm and cheerful countenances.”\r\n\r\nThe next number does not appear, apparently being suppressed by\r\nthe new Governor, but in the succeeding week it again was issued\r\nthrough the good graces of certain leading citizens who had\r\nprocured him this liberty. He promises gratitude to the Governor\r\nand the succeeding numbers are strictly literary subjects, such\r\nas discussions on the opinions of Voltaire and the utility of the\r\nestablishment of an Academy of Science.\r\n\r\nIn April, 1779, Mesplet invited criticism on a recent judicial\r\ndecision, for which he was summoned to court and reprimanded\r\nagainst any repetition of the offence. But he was recalcitrant\r\nand in the fall he was arrested and taken to Quebec, the paper\r\nbeing suspended apparently till 1785.\r\n\r\nBy 1788 Mesplet’s paper was enlarged from quarter to foolscap\r\nfour pages, printed in double columns in French and English. It\r\nseems to have become more of a newspaper and news a month old was\r\nserved up to eager Montrealers. In 1789 there was still little\r\ncommercial news, but there was a “Poet’s Corner” and several\r\npoems of Robert Burns, then rising to fame, are honoured there.\r\nIn this year political discussion, a subject in the early days\r\ntabooed, appears in the Gazette. A correspondent discussing the\r\nburning question of a House of Assembly sums up thus:\r\n\r\n“We are all Canadians and subjects of Great Britain. The\r\ndistinction of old and new subjects ought to have been done away\r\nwith long since. The prosperity of this country must depend on\r\nthe unanimity that prevails amongst us. I am of the opinion that\r\nmuch good may be derived from a House of Assembly. Yet I fear\r\nthe consequent evils, one of which is taxing a country unable to\r\nsupport the dignity of a House. The peasantry would not easily\r\ndigest what that House of Assembly might impose and few, if any,\r\nof their class would be able to share in the legislation. It\r\nwill, therefore, be the policy of Government to procrastinate\r\nthis event until the province is really and fully Anglified,\r\nwhen, perhaps, a House of Assembly may be better known and\r\nreceived with the united voice of approbation.”\r\n\r\nUp to this year the paper was published by F. Mesplet, 40 Notre\r\nDame Street. In 1795 it passed into the hands of Thomas A. Turner\r\nand was issued from an office on the corner of Notre Dame Street\r\nand St. Jean Baptiste. By 1804 it had passed over to E. Edward,\r\n135 St. Paul Street.\r\n\r\nThe date of November 10, 1804, records the movement for the first\r\ntheatre in Montreal.\r\n\r\n“Mr. Ormsby from the Theatre Royal, Edinburgh, respectfully\r\ninforms the ladies and gentlemen of Montreal that he intends,\r\nwith their approbation, establishing a company of comedians\r\nin Canada, to perform in Montreal and Quebec alternately. The\r\ntheatre in this city is fitted up in that large and commodious\r\nhouse next door to the Post Office, where will be presented on\r\nMonday evening, 19th inst., a comedy in five acts called ‘The\r\nBusy Body,’ to which will be added the much admired farce called\r\n‘The Sultan.’\r\n\r\n“N.B. Particulars in advertisement for the evening: Boxes, 5s;\r\ngallery, 2s. 6d. Tickets to be had at Mr. Hamilton’s Tavern, the\r\nMontreal Hotel and at the theatre where places for the boxes may\r\nbe taken.”\r\n\r\nThe news of the death and victory of Lord Nelson at Trafalgar\r\non October 21, 1805, reached Montreal in the winter of 1805-6\r\nand was the occasion of great activity among the inhabitants, so\r\nthat immediately a subscription was taken up to raise their first\r\nmonument. A committee was appointed and these in conjunction with\r\nSix Alexander Mackenzie, Thomas Forsyth and John Gillespie, then\r\nin London, took steps to raise it. The Governor-General, Sir J.\r\nCraig, having given the magistrates a piece of ground for general\r\nimprovement, these granted a portion of it, at the upper end of\r\nthe new market place, as a site for the intended column. The\r\nfoundation stone was laid on August 17, 1809, and the monument\r\nwas built of grey compact limestone of the district.\r\n\r\nThe four panel ornaments were of artificial stone invented by\r\nCoade & Seeley, of London. The battle of the Nile is represented\r\non the north side. That on the east represents the interview\r\nbetween Lord Nelson and the Prince Regent of Denmark on the\r\nlanding of Lord Nelson after the engagement off Copenhagen.\r\nThe panel on the south side facing the river commemorates the\r\nbattle of Trafalgar. The west side has the neatest panel, being\r\nornamented with cannon, anchors and other appropriate naval\r\ntrophies with a circular wreath surrounding the whole inscription:\r\n\r\n                          In Memory of\r\n      The Right Honorable Vice-Admiral Lord Viscount Nelson\r\n                         Duke of Bronté\r\n    Who terminated his career of Naval glory in the memorable\r\n                       Battle of Trafalgar\r\n                  On the 21st of October, 1805,\r\n                   After inculcating by Signal\r\n                         This Sentiment\r\n              Never to be forgotten by his Country,\r\n          “ENGLAND EXPECTS EVERY MAN WILL DO HIS DUTY.”\r\n            This monumental column was erected by the\r\n                     Inhabitants of Montreal\r\n                        In the year 1808.\r\n\r\nThe expense of this column when complete with the iron railing\r\nwas £1,300. In the first cut stone at the east corner of the\r\nbase, a plate of lead was deposited bearing the following\r\ninscription:\r\n\r\n“In memory of the Right Honourable Admiral Lord Viscount Nelson,\r\nDuke of Bronté, who terminated his career of naval glory on the\r\n21st of October, 1805, this monumental pillar was erected by a\r\nsubscription of the inhabitants of Montreal, whereof the Hon. Sir\r\nJohn Johnston, Knight and Baronet, the Hon. James Monk, Chief\r\nJustice of Montreal, John Richardson, John Ogilvie and Louis\r\nChaboillez, Esquires, were a committee appointed for carrying it\r\ninto execution, and the same was erected under the direction of\r\nWilliam Gilmore, stone cutter and mason, from designs obtained\r\nfrom Mitchell, an architect in London.--17th August, 1809.”\r\n\r\nReturning to the Gazette, a sidelight of 1806 thrown by an\r\nadvertisement of William Gilmore, dated 7th June, reveals to us\r\nthe apprenticeship system as then in vogue. It may seem to some\r\nan industrial tyranny.\r\n\r\n“Ran away from the subscriber: Alexander Thompson, an indentured\r\napprentice, about 22 years of age, 5 ft. 5 in. in height, red\r\ncurly hair and bandy legs. All persons are hereby forbid hiring\r\nhim under penalty of law. Any person who will bring him back\r\nshall receive three pence reward, no charges paid.”\r\n\r\nThus far the Gazette. The history of the Gazette of today, its\r\nsuccessor, may be found in “Montreal, the Commercial Metropolis\r\nof Canada,” 1907.\r\n\r\nLet us now present a side light of about this period.\r\n\r\nAt this time the Montreal Hotel was one of the chief hotels and\r\nit was kept by a Mr. Dillon who had some reputation as a water\r\ncolourist of local scenes.\r\n\r\nJohn Lambert, who visited the United States and Canada in 1806,\r\n1807 and 1808, has the following picture: “The only open place\r\nor square in the town,” he says in his account of Montreal,\r\n“except the two markets, under the French Government was the\r\nplace where the garrison troops were paraded. The French Catholic\r\nchurch occupies the whole of the east side of this square; and\r\non the south side, adjoining some private houses, is a very good\r\ntavern, called the Montreal Hotel, kept by Mr. Dillon. During my\r\nstay in this city I lodged at his house and found it superior\r\nto any in Canada; everything in it is neat, cleanly and well\r\nconducted.” From his characterization of the landlord, one is\r\nsomewhat disappointed that he does not mention his artistic\r\ngift. “The old gentleman,” he says, “came out in the retinue of\r\nLord Dorchester; he is a very ingenious character.” But then,\r\ninstead of commending his water colors, as one would naturally\r\nexpect, Lambert concludes his notice of Dillon in these words:\r\n“and fond of expressing his attachment to his King and country\r\nby illuminations and firing his pedereroes off in the square.”\r\nLambert also refers to the new parade ground. “At the back of\r\nthe town, just behind the new courthouse, is the parade ground\r\nwhere the troops are exercised.” And, after some further words of\r\ndescription, he proceeds to suggest a truly attractive picture\r\nof suburban Montreal in the early nineteenth century. “Here,” he\r\nsays, “the inhabitants walk of an evening and enjoy a beautiful\r\nview of the suburbs of St. Lawrence and St. Antoine, and the\r\nnumerous gardens, orchards and plantations of the gentry, adorned\r\nwith neat and handsome dwelling houses.” These, with green fields\r\ninterspersed, lead up to the mountain from which the island and\r\nthe city have taken the name of Montreal.\r\n\r\nWe will now turn to a new literary venture.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: About 1875 NELSON’S MONUMENT The building on\r\nthe left is the house originally built in 1720 by Baron de\r\nBecancourt. It became the store of the Campagnie des Indes,\r\nwhich in the French times answered to the Hudson’s Bay Company.\r\nThis was also the residence of the Hon. James McGill, founder of\r\nMcGill University. It was demolished in 1903.]\r\n\r\nAfter the Gazette there came the “Canadian Courant” founded\r\nat Montreal in 1807 by Nahum Mower, a native of Worcester,\r\nMassachusetts. There came with him Stephen Mills, who was born\r\nin Rozalton, Vermont. The latter remained at Montreal till 1810,\r\nwhen he went to Kingston, where he founded the Kingston Gazette.\r\nHe became a minister in 1835. These two New Englanders placed a\r\ndistinctly American stamp on the new paper. The name “Canadian”\r\nwas revolutionary to the old British colonists, but it pleased\r\nthe French. The “Courant” lasted until between 1835 and 1840.\r\nThat it should have continued its existence so long, looked on\r\nwith suspicion by the chief English residents as democratic\r\nand revolutionary, would suggest that it was subsidized either\r\nby American merchants, for the trade relations now between\r\nthe two countries were becoming intimate and profitable, or\r\nby the government of the United States, who, baulked in their\r\nrevolutionary designs hitherto, were still desirous of seducing\r\nthe neighbouring “Fourteenth” colony from its allegiance.\r\n\r\nNahum Mower left in 1829, and in his valedictory he claims to\r\nhave made good his pledge in the first number that he “should\r\nmake it his duty to become a good subject and endeavour others\r\nto continue so.” He worshiped, till 1813, when he sold his pew,\r\nin St. Gabriel’s Church, the only non-Anglican church then\r\nin existence, and the temporary home of all English-speaking\r\nnon-conformists. Still he was accused of undue intimacy with the\r\nenemies of the British Connexion in Canada, especially during the\r\ntroublous times of 1812 and the years of apprehension after.\r\n\r\nThe Canadian Courant had an early rival in the Montreal Herald,\r\nwhich published its first number on Saturday, October 19, 1811.\r\nIts first printer and founder was a young Scotchman, William\r\nGray, of Huntly, Aberdeenshire, born on August 12, 1789. He\r\narrived in Montreal in June, 1811. In 1812, May 25th, he was\r\nmarried to Agnes Smith, of Aberdeen, by the Reverend Mr.\r\nSomerville. William Gray, as surmised by Doctor Campbell in his\r\n“History of St. Gabriel’s Church,” seems to have been related in\r\nsome degree of cousinship to Alexander Skakel, the most noted of\r\nthe Montreal early British schoolmasters. He died at the early\r\nage of thirty-three, on February 28, 1822, having caught a cold\r\non a journey in a Durham boat on his way from Toronto to attend\r\nto his business affairs, on hearing that in his absence his\r\noffice had been mobbed by a crowd of French-Canadians, displeased\r\nwith the tone of some of his articles. This young editor has left\r\nbehind him a record of personal probity, good discernment and\r\nstrong personal courage. His task in 1811 was no easy one--to\r\nestablish an independent and unsubsidized paper in a small town.\r\n\r\nThe files of the early Herald give a contemporary picture of\r\nlife of the community. Canada then had about four hundred\r\nthousand inhabitants, of whom most were in the Lower province;\r\nabout four thousand five hundred regular British troops were\r\nmostly stationed there, also. Upper Canada consisted of only a\r\nfew settlements, scattered here and there on the highways. Fur\r\ntrading was the basic industry of the colony and its headquarters\r\nwas at Montreal, the home and storage centre of the wealthy fur\r\ntraders of the Beaver Hall Club. Agriculture was neglected till\r\nafter the War of 1812, when it became realized that farming\r\nshould be the staple industry of the colony. Unskilled labour\r\nwas then performed by French Canadians, for there was yet no\r\nBritish immigrant labouring class. The skilled artisans came\r\nmostly from across the border, but the lesser storekeepers and\r\nmerchants, chiefly Scotch, with an admixture of English and\r\nYankees, were beginning to build up the permanent commerce of the\r\ncity that was not always to be exclusively that of the fur trade.\r\nAmong the business men then building up Montreal trade who were\r\nalready well established before the war of 1812 were Alexander\r\nHenry, auctioneer; Benaiah Gibb, merchant; John Dillon, lumber\r\nmerchant; James Brown, book-seller and owner of the Gazette;\r\nPeter McCutcheon, merchant; James and Andrew McGill, Forsyth,\r\nRichardson & Company, Maitland, Garden & Auldjo, Woolrich &\r\nCooper, John Shuter, Samuel Gerrard, John Molson & Son, brewers\r\nand steamboat proprietors; Daniel Arnoldi, surgeon, and others.\r\n\r\nThe first home of the Herald, as far as ascertainable, was the\r\n23 St. Paul Street given in Doige’s Directory of Montreal in\r\n1819, the first systematic list of Montreal addresses. There\r\nis no proof of its having moved from elsewhere since 1811. On\r\neither side of it were two taverns, the Montreal Academy, a\r\nfamous school kept by William Ryan, the residence of Joseph\r\nPapineau, eminent notary and public notary and father of the\r\nfamous Louis Joseph, who was to become the “patriot” leader, and\r\na small bookshop kept by a J. Russell. Near at hand, following\r\nDoige’s numbering, was the commissariat office and the residence\r\nof Colonel McKey, of the Indian Department, while a few doors\r\naway was the house of Peter McCutcheon, the famous merchant who\r\nafterward took the name of McGill. The “Canadian Courant” was\r\nestablished at 92 St. Paul Street, barely thirty doors from the\r\nHerald, and shared its premises with Daniel Campbell, a grocer.\r\nWilliam Gray lived above his printing premises, as did his editor\r\nin 1819, Doctor Christie, and probably the latter’s predecessor,\r\nMungo Kay, who was a Montreal merchant before he took to the\r\njournalist’s pen. At that date, and indeed for many long years,\r\nmost of the storekeepers on St. Paul Street lived over their\r\nplaces of business. St. Paul Street was then the chief retail\r\nstreet; it ran the southern length of the town from the eastern\r\nfortifications of the Quebec suburbs to the western ones, ending\r\nat the present McGill Street. At either end there was a generous\r\nsupply of taverns to meet the needs of those coming in from the\r\ncountry. In between them was a close succession of groceries,\r\ntailor shops, dry goods houses, hardware stores, druggists,\r\nbootmakers, glaziers, plumbers and the like. The Gazette at this\r\nperiod had its home on St. François Xavier Street.\r\n\r\nThe newspapers of the period received an addition by the advent\r\nof the first French-Canadian paper issued in Montreal, the\r\n“Spectateur.” They frequently had “brushes” with one another. In\r\n1814, on July 2, a writer for the Herald, probably Mungo Kay,\r\naddressed an ode to a French-Canadian writer in the Spectator\r\nwhom he calls “a certain gros bourgeois” and rallying him\r\nconcerning a story, evidently known, of his efforts to cozen a\r\ncertain negro:\r\n\r\n    See, wrapt in whirlwinds, from his stand\r\n    On leathern wings he takes his flight,\r\n    And on fell Mungo, with unequal hand\r\n    Sped rancorous the rodures of the night;\r\n    In deeds of darkness are their chief delight.\r\n    And see, advancing ’thwart the storm\r\n    Deception with his blotted form;\r\n    Who tried the sable African to charm,\r\n    But failed in his attempt to make him green,\r\n    Albeit he the Justice did alarm,\r\n    Who quaked with fear that he ’mong Truth’s friends should be seen.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE PRESS BUILDINGS: The Herald]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE PRESS BUILDINGS: La Presse]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE PRESS BUILDINGS: The Star]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE PRESS BUILDINGS: La Patrie]\r\n\r\nNext week another satiric poem was addressed to certain\r\n“Spectators” who had two urns.\r\n\r\n    “One flows for B. and M----r warm with praise,\r\n      And one for M----o bitter gall displays.”\r\n\r\nFor B. read Brown (John), the owner of the Gazette; for M----r,\r\nMower (Nahum), the proprietor of the Courant; and M----o for\r\nMungo Kay. Mungo Kay is credited by the Gazette in an obituary\r\nnotice of him in 1813 on his death on September 18th, as having\r\nas editor for nearly seven years justified his choice of motto:\r\n“Aninos Novitate Tenebo”--“I will hold attention by means of\r\nnovelty.” This was not meant to be satire but a tribute to his\r\nefforts to obtain the earliest intelligence. The Herald early\r\nbegan its “extra special additions.” In 1812, before it had been\r\na year in existence, the Quebec Gazette reprinted such a special\r\nedition with the following acknowledgment:\r\n\r\n“We beg the editors of the Herald to accept our thanks for their\r\nattention in transmitting the intelligence of the surrender of\r\nGeneral Hull. This is not the first time that the public has been\r\nindebted to them for early intelligence.”\r\n\r\nNews in those days was hard to obtain, but even if a month late\r\nit was read with avidity, for the Napoleonic wars, involving the\r\npeace and security of the mother country and their own colony,\r\nwhich became involved in all British quarrels, found a passionate\r\nsource of interest in the truly colonial loyalists of Montreal,\r\nwho were surrounded by ill-wishers, secret or open, on all\r\nsides. It is amusing, however, to read the account of the Battle\r\nof Waterloo under the single line caption “Highly Interesting\r\nIntelligence,” the art of display headlines not then having\r\nbecome so pronounced.\r\n\r\nThe news of the victory of Waterloo reached Montreal in July,\r\n1815. Montreal in its joy bethought itself of the widows\r\nand children of those who fell in the fateful battle and in\r\nconsequence of a meeting called in the courthouse an amount of\r\n£2,717 16s 8d was soon raised, which was later added to largely.\r\n\r\nOf local or colonial news, there being little or none, there was\r\nscant supply. But after 1815 the Montreal papers begin to have\r\ncriticisms on matters nearer home. A class of writers now arose,\r\nespecially in the Herald, the most daring unofficial paper of the\r\nperiod, who dealt ably and trenchantly on questions of policy\r\nand administration in Canada. These were written mostly under\r\nmythological pseudonyms to avoid personal responsibility and\r\nattack. This continued for many years. The anonymity of many has\r\nnot yet been disclosed in literature, although there must have\r\nbeen many at Montreal to whom the real authorship was an open\r\nsecret. “Nerva,” who wrote in the Herald much to inflame public\r\nopinion, has been disclosed later by the Montreal Gazette in an\r\nobituary notice, to have been the Hon. Samuel Gale, afterwards a\r\nfamous justice of the superior court. Others, like “Aristides,”\r\nan early critic of the House of Assembly; “A true Jacobin,”\r\na violent satirist of abuses in the police administration;\r\n“Observer,” complaining of extortion and sale of justice by\r\npolice court officials; “Alfred,” with his suggestion that a\r\nstrip of land ten miles wide should be laid and kept absolutely\r\nwaste along the American frontiers as the only real safeguard\r\nagainst renewed invasion after the peace of 1814 (this same\r\nwriter also protests earnestly against the insidious effects\r\nof Webster’s republican spelling book); “Veritas,” with his\r\ncrushing exposure of the incapacity of Sir George Prevost--these\r\ncontributed letters, together with outspoken editorial utterances\r\nwritten by Gray or Skakel, causing a fluttering in the dovecots\r\nof officialdom.\r\n\r\nIn 1815 bills of indictment were found against the editor and\r\nprinter of the Herald for libel on the commander in chief, but as\r\nSir George Prevost was recalled the case never came to trial.\r\n\r\nThe earliest extant copy known of the Herald is dated March 2,\r\n1812. It was a paper 13 inches by 20½ inches, and contained\r\nfour pages of four columns, which latter, in 1814, was changed\r\nto five. It started with a circulation of 170 subscribers, 150\r\nbeing Montrealers. On its third anniversary the statement was\r\ngiven in the paper that the “weekly distribution rather exceeds\r\none thousand impressions.” The price was $4.00 per annum. In\r\nAugust a larger sheet appeared, 15 inches wide by 21½ inches\r\ndeep, and was divided into five columns, the editor calling\r\nhis paper “a quarter larger than our former or any other paper\r\npublished in North America,” and adding “The Herald has more\r\ncirculation, probably by some hundred, than any other paper in\r\nCanada.” The enlargement of the sheet, which was followed by\r\nfrequent supplementary sheets on a Wednesday, indicate the growth\r\nof advertising and commercial correspondence, and the immense\r\nincrease of commerce after the peace. Indeed, at the time an\r\nattempt was made to establish a fourth Montreal paper, “The\r\nSun.” Its promoters were Lane, a printer on St. Paul Street, and\r\nBowman, a stationer on St. François Xavier Street. It only lasted\r\na few issues.\r\n\r\nAnti-American animadversions, however, still survived. The\r\ndemocratic leaders of the time were accused of being supplied\r\nwith Yankee money and Yankee ideals. Samuel Sherwood, an American\r\nby birth and an early leader for popular government, was accused\r\nby the Herald of having given traitorous support and advice to\r\nthe Americans during the War of 1812 and of keeping the “Sun” and\r\nthe Canadian Courant supplied with “Jacobin” information from\r\nAmerican sources.\r\n\r\nA picture of the pigmy city of the period, written in 1870 by\r\nMr. T.S. Brown in a small, forgotten pamphlet entitled “Montreal\r\nFifty Years Ago”, may fitly help to illustrate this period:\r\n\r\n  “On the 28th of May, 1818, I first landed at Montreal. On my left\r\n  was a dirty creek running down inside of a warehouse, being the\r\n  outlet of a ditch, now tunnelled, that then, as a part of the old\r\n  fortifications, ran around the city, westerly from the Champ de\r\n  Mars through Craig street, with dilapidated banks, the receptacle\r\n  of all sorts of filth. Above and below there was a revetment of\r\n  a few hundred feet; except this, the beach and river bank were\r\n  in their natural state. Just above the Grey Nunnery there was a\r\n  cottage with a garden running down to the river, and adjoining\r\n  this a ship yard where vessels continued to be built for some\r\n  years later. Further on, the place of the Lachine Canal was a\r\n  common with three windmills and the graves of three soldiers shot\r\n  for desertion. The Island Wharf was then a little island, far off\r\n  and alone.\r\n\r\n  “The city gates and fortifications, such as they were, had\r\n  been removed some time previous. A remnant of walls remained\r\n  at the corner of McGill and Commissioners streets, and between\r\n  Bonsecours street and Dalhousie Square there was a mound of earth\r\n  55 feet high, called the ‘citadel.’ The old rampart on Great St.\r\n  James street had been levelled, but there was no building on the\r\n  west side between St. François Xavier and McGill streets. The\r\n  northern portion had been a cemetery and an old powder magazine\r\n  still stood in the middle of the street.... I came into the city\r\n  through a narrow passage leading to the Custom House Square, then\r\n  the ‘Old Market,’ a low, wooden shed-like building; and along\r\n  the south side of the square was a row of old women seated at\r\n  tables with eatables for sale. Capital street was a succession\r\n  of drinking houses carrying on an active business from morning\r\n  until night.... The largest was that of Thomas l’Italien (Thomas\r\n  Delvecchio), facing the Market with a clock, on which small\r\n  figures came out to strike the hours, to the continued wonderment\r\n  of all, and next came Les trois Rois, of Joseph Donegani. This\r\n  was the center of trade. A new market of similar construction\r\n  had been erected on the present Jacques Cartier Square, running\r\n  from Nelson’s monument (opposite to which was the guard house,\r\n  jail, pillory and courthouse) to St. Paul street, but it was not\r\n  liked. Everybody crowded to the little space of the Old Market\r\n  and habitant vehicles so filled St. Paul street in each direction\r\n  that constables were often sent to drive them down to the new\r\n  market....\r\n\r\n  “Along the beach were moored several small ships and brigs,\r\n  constituting the spring fleet.... The city was bounded by the\r\n  river on the east, by Bonsecours street and the Citadel on\r\n  the north, Craig street on the west, and McGill street on the\r\n  south; within which limits all the ‘respectable’ people with few\r\n  exceptions resided. The population in it was nearly as great as\r\n  today--the upper part of nearly every store being occupied as a\r\n  dwelling. All the houses in Notre Dame street were dwellings--in\r\n  its whole length there were but two shops and three auction\r\n  rooms. The cross streets’ buildings were nearly all dwellings\r\n  and commercial business was almost confined to St. Paul street.\r\n  Wholesale stores, except the establishment of Gillespie, Moffat\r\n  & Company, were small indeed compared to the growth of after\r\n  years.... There were numerous shops for country trade, all doors\r\n  and no windows, always open winter and summer, with a goodly\r\n  portion of the stock displayed outside, where salesmen without\r\n  number were stationed to accost and bring in customers, who were\r\n  often dragged forcibly....\r\n\r\n  “Nunneries occupied more space than now--the Hotel Dieu making\r\n  an ugly break in St. Paul street. Of churches there were few....\r\n  The city was composed of one and two story houses, very few of\r\n  three stories, built, with very few exceptions, of rubble stone,\r\n  plastered over. All the stores and many of the houses had iron\r\n  doors and shutters; many buildings had vaulted cellars and many\r\n  had the garret floored with heavy logs, covered with several\r\n  inches of earth, and flat paving stones, with a stone staircase\r\n  outside, so that a roof might burn without doing other damage....\r\n\r\n  “Four streets leading to the country--St. Mary’s, St. Laurent,\r\n  St. Joseph and St. Antoine--were bordered by houses, mostly of\r\n  wood--one story, but intervening streets were short and vacant\r\n  ground extensive. Log fences divided fields on the west of Craig\r\n  street as far as Beaver Hall Hill, which was a grassy lawn with\r\n  a long, one-story wooden building across the summit and a garden\r\n  behind. All to the west of this was open fields where now stands\r\n  the city of our richest people....\r\n\r\n  “Village primitiveness had not disappeared in Montreal fifty\r\n  years ago. Old men sat out on the doorsteps to gossip with\r\n  passing friends and often the family would be found there of an\r\n  evening. In the suburbs neighbours would collect for a dance in\r\n  the largest house and any respectable passer-by was welcomed if\r\n  he chose to step in.... Business relations were more intimate\r\n  between French and English fifty years ago than now, and I think\r\n  there was more kindly feeling.... But social relations were much\r\n  as they are now, the races keeping separate in their charities,\r\n  their amusements and their gatherings. The English were more\r\n  dominant--they were more generally the employers, the French the\r\n  employed.”\r\n\r\nNovember of 1819 was marked by an alarming natural phenomenon.\r\nOn Sunday the 9th a dense black rain descended, depositing a\r\nsubstance which to the eye and taste resembled common soot. On\r\nthe following Tuesday, after a dark morning of gloom, with the\r\nsun clouds at times greenish black, pitch black, dingy orange\r\ncolour and blood red, so that some thought that the history of\r\nPompeii or Herculaneum was to be repeated, and feared that Mount\r\nRoyal, reported already to be the extinct crater of a volcano,\r\nwas again in activity. At 3 o’clock in the afternoon rain fell\r\nagain of the same sooty character mid fearful lightning and\r\nthunder. At 4 o’clock the summit of the steeple of Notre Dame\r\nChurch was struck with lightning. The tocsin sounded a fire\r\nalarm; the steeple was on fire. The people gathered on Place\r\nd’Armes and before the conflagration was extinguished, the great\r\ncross fell with a crash, breaking into many pieces. The rain had\r\ndeposited greater quantities of the sooty substance than on the\r\nSunday preceding and “as it flowed through the streets it carried\r\non its surface a dense foam resembling soapsuds. The evening\r\nagain became darker and thus ended a day which may be classed\r\namong the _dies atri_ of Montreal.”\r\n\r\nAt this time there was a certain official society life in the\r\ncity which was fostered by the young military officers from the\r\nold country, to whom, apart from their extravagances, the colony\r\nis largely indebted for its heritage of culture, literature\r\nand art. The religious situation was filled by three Catholic\r\nchurches, the Notre Dame parish church, built in 1672; the\r\nBonsecours Chapel, rebuilt in 1771, and the “Recollets,” built\r\nin 1695, and loaned at different periods to the Anglicans and\r\nPresbyterians till they had their own temples. There were two\r\nProtestant churches, the Anglican Christ Church, which was the\r\nold disused Jesuit church till 1803, but which was now in its\r\nown edifice on Notre Dame Street in 1814, and the Presbyterian\r\nor Scotch chapel on St. Gabriel’s Street, built in 1792. The\r\nreligious horizon was not clear. The Catholics and Presbyterians,\r\nor non-Conformist group, both had grudges against the Anglicans,\r\narising from the question of the clergy reserves by which,\r\naccording to the Constitutional Act of 1791, the Anglicans were\r\nthe established church and reserves of land were provided for\r\ntheir growth and expansion to the exclusion of other Protestant\r\ndenominations, who resented this privilege in a new country,\r\nespecially by the “Church of Scotland,” who claimed equal rights\r\nto establishment, and the Catholics who had become civilly\r\ncrippled and disestablished since the conquest, when they came\r\nunder the same condition of the civil disabilities meted out to\r\nthe Catholics in the old country.\r\n\r\nThe government officials and most of the British military\r\nofficers therefore attended the Anglican services, while the\r\nfur lords and the traders, those of St. Gabriel’s church. The\r\nnewspapers took sides. The Gazette followed the government\r\nparty, while the Courant and the Herald voiced the views of\r\nthe dissentients. In 1825 the Herald was bought by Archibald\r\nFerguson, a rich merchant of Montreal, for the express purpose\r\nof upholding the rights of the Presbyterian church to a share in\r\nthe clergy reserves, on the ground that the Scottish Church in\r\nCanada should be considered as much an established church as that\r\nof the Anglicans. Eventually it gradually came to be recognized\r\nin the courts that there were three “established” churches in\r\nCanada, the Anglicans, the Scottish and the Catholics.[1] But\r\nthe increasing number of non-conformist bodies arising could\r\nnot brook this, and so the old opposition against the “clergy\r\nreserves” was renewed and it was not till 1854 that this long\r\nburning question was settled by total diversion of the reserves\r\nfrom all religious purposes.\r\n\r\nWe may now return to the story of the Constitutional struggles\r\nagain about to commence and in which Montreal was to take a\r\nleading part.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[1] The historical development of the churches of Montreal is\r\nspecially treated in the second part of this volume.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                           CHAPTER XV\r\n\r\n                    BUREAURACY vs. DEMOCRACY\r\n\r\n                THE PROPOSED UNION OF THE CANADAS\r\n\r\n  REPRESENTATIVE GOVERNMENT--MUNICIPAL AFFAIRS--FRENCH-CANADIANS\r\n    AIM TO STRENGTHEN THEIR POLITICAL POWER--THE “COLONIAL” OFFICE\r\n    AND THE BUREAUCRATIC CLASS VERSUS THE DEMOCRATIC REPRESENTATIVE\r\n    ASSEMBLY--L.

In Lower Canada the bureaucratic\r\nparty opposed the French-Canadians and many of those of British\r\norigin. Furthermore there was added the development of a race\r\nenmity which ended so disastrously in the uprising of the\r\n“patriots” in 1837. The political situation was tense for half a\r\ncentury. The fight for mastery was between the legislative and\r\nexecutive council appointed by the Governor, and the legislative\r\nassemblies elected by the people.\r\n\r\nMontreal felt the strain keenly. Viewed municipally its affairs\r\nwere regulated from Quebec. The Parliament there exercising\r\nsimilar powers to those of our municipal council of today, but\r\ngreater. The justices of the peace nominated by the executive\r\ncouncil of the Province were but the executive arm carrying out\r\nthe will of Quebec.\r\n\r\nThe constitutional struggles of this period so affected the life\r\nof Montreal, that to preserve a true picture we must still study\r\ntheir history. Passion always showed itself there more than\r\nelsewhere.\r\n\r\nThe war with the United States being over, the prevailing\r\nsentiment of all parties was one of loyalty to Great Britain. To\r\nnone was this more attributable than to the French-Canadians,\r\nfor they saw that an alliance with the States would swamp them\r\npolitically and subvert their religion. They turned their\r\nattention to securing a strong hold on the management of\r\ngovernment with the intention of strengthening the position\r\ngranted them by the Quebec and Constitutional acts in the\r\nretainment of their laws, institutions and customs. They were\r\nlearning self-government. They were beginning to demand a form\r\nof responsible government. Not, indeed, as it was afterwards\r\nunderstood, for it took the form only of desiring an elective\r\ncouncil, one that, being outside crown nomination, would give\r\nthem real power to control revenues. This the Governors, acting\r\nunder instructions from the Colonial Office, were not prepared to\r\ngrant. Canada was to be ruled as a colony from Downing Street. It\r\nwas in _statu pupillari_.\r\n\r\nThe history of the next twenty-five years and more reveals the\r\nefforts of the two classes; on the one hand, of the Governors,\r\nthe legislative council, the office holders under government,\r\nBritish and French-Canadians and the wealthier British merchants,\r\nwhose interests lay in being in combination with the governing\r\nclasses; and on the other, the majority of the people feeling\r\ntheir power, using their new freedom and striving democratically\r\nto make their numerical superiority give them the dominance they\r\nthought their right. Add to this the natural tendency of any\r\ndemocratic assembly to assert itself and to claim the fullest of\r\npowers for itself. Hence the House of Assembly, reflecting the\r\npeople, is seen to be in constant opposition to the executive\r\ncouncil, sometimes extravagantly asserting itself and running\r\nto extremes. Thus attacked, the bureaucratic party grew nearer\r\ntogether. Hence two spirits of suspicion and race enmity were\r\nbeing formed. All this was reflected in the life of the people\r\nand nowhere more strongly than in Montreal.\r\n\r\nIt would be tedious to follow the various sessions of Parliament,\r\neven to watch the Montreal county and town representatives such\r\nas the members for Montreal West, L.J. Papineau, the son of\r\nJoseph Papineau, now being in the ascendant and the incarnation\r\nof the most advanced Canadian pretensions, and Mr. Richardson,\r\na Montreal merchant, a member of the council of legislature\r\nwho represented the British minority, strongly siding with the\r\ngovernment. The tension existing between the two parties was\r\nvoiced by Mr. Richardson in 1821, when he exclaimed: “How can\r\nwe (the legislative council) rescind our resolutions when there\r\nis a secret committee sitting in the House of Assembly which\r\nis, perhaps, deliberating on the appointment of the governor of\r\ntheir choice and on the removal of the person now in the castle,\r\nand putting their own in his place. The committee even sits\r\nwithout the knowledge of several members of the house of which\r\nthere is no example in England except in the times of Charles\r\nI. The committee is, perhaps, a committee of public safety.”\r\n(“Christie,” Vol. II, page 72.)\r\n\r\nThe words produced a hurricane. The assembly passed resolutions\r\ncalling for Mr. Richardson’s removal from all posts of honour.\r\nThe adverse state of feeling may be best described by the passion\r\naroused over a supposed act for the union of the two provinces in\r\n1822, when the legislatures were to be united under the name of\r\n“the legislative council and assembly of the Canadas.” The bill\r\nwas introduced in the English parliament by Sir Wilmot Horton,\r\nUnder Secretary of State of the Colonies. It was opposed by Sir\r\nJames McIntosh and others on the ground that Canada had not been\r\nmade aware of the contemplated changes, which was very true.\r\nConsequently the bill was delayed.\r\n\r\nIn November Lower and Upper Canada were preparing their petitions\r\nfor and against the proposed union, both French and English names\r\nbeing attached to the petition. Quebec was against it; Montreal\r\ndistrict was divided. The French constitutional committee also\r\nrefuted it. The names of those present embrace the Honourables:\r\nL.J. Papineau (chairman); Chs. de St. Ours, M.L. C.; L.R.C. de\r\nLéry, M.L.C.; P.D. Debartzch, M.L.C.; Chs. de Salaberry, C.K. and\r\nM.L.C.; and Messrs. Louis Guy, Frs. Derivières, D.B. Viger, M.P.\r\nP., J. Bouthillier, J. Bedard, J.R. Roland, H. Cuvillier, M.P.P.,\r\nH. Henry, M.P.P., F.A. Quesnel, M.P.P., Louis Bourdage, M.P.P.,\r\nF.A. Larocque, J. Quesnel, and R.J. Kimber. Eventually L.J.\r\nPapineau and Mr. John Neilson were chosen to proceed to England\r\nto represent the non-union case. Lower Canada as such prepared\r\na petition against the union. It is claimed to have been signed\r\nby 60,000 by signature or by a mark. The Montreal bulky petition\r\nof twenty-nine pages in favour of the union from His Majesty’s\r\n“dutiful and loyal subjects of British birth and descent,\r\ninhabitants of the city and county of Montreal” bore 1,452\r\nsignatures and the date, December, 1822. The committee in charge\r\nof forwarding the petition was: John Richardson (chairman);\r\nC. W. Grant; J. Stuart; S. Gerrard; George Garden; Fred’k W.\r\nErmatinger; Samuel Gale; G. Moffatt; John Molson; John Fleming.\r\nMr. Stuart was chosen to present the case for union in England.\r\n\r\nThe petition represented that the division of the Province of\r\nQuebec into two provinces has been prolific of evil; that it\r\nhas resulted in that the English population of Lower Canada has\r\nbeen rendered inefficient from the comparative smallness of\r\ntheir numbers since the whole power of the representative branch\r\nof the government had been given to the French-Canadians, so\r\nthat of fifty members who represent Lower Canada only ten are\r\nEnglish; that the assembly may indeed be said to be exclusively\r\nin possession of the uneducated peasantry of the country,\r\nunder the management and control of a few of their countrymen\r\nwhose personal importance, in opposition to the interests of\r\nthe country at large, depend on the continuance of the present\r\nvicious system; that the speaker elected by the assembly was\r\nnever of English origin “although if regard had been had to\r\nability, knowledge and other qualifications, a preference must\r\nhave been given to persons of that description;” that the\r\nFrench-Canadian population hitherto unused to political power\r\nhad not used it with moderation, so that British emigration had\r\nbeen prevented; that the advancement of the colony was paralyzed;\r\nagriculture and “all commercial enterprise and improvement have\r\nbeen crippled and obstructed and the country remains with all\r\nthe foreign characteristics which it possessed at the time of\r\nthe conquest; that is, in all particulars French. The division\r\ninto two provinces would result in Upper Canada availing itself\r\nof the advantages offered to trade with American seaports\r\nthrough the new canal system being elaborated by the state of\r\nNew York. Secondly it has resulted in the continual disputes\r\nbetween Upper and Lower Canada respecting revenues from import\r\nduties, which can only be settled by the union of the provinces\r\nunder one legislature. The petition refers to the desire of the\r\nFrench to establish a separate nation under the nature of the\r\n“Nation Canadienne.” The petitioners in conclusion beg leave to\r\n“specify succinctly the benefits to be expected from a Union of\r\nthe Provinces. By this measure the political evils complained\r\nof in both Provinces would be removed. The French population\r\nin Lower Canada, now divided from their fellow subjects by\r\ntheir national peculiarities and prejudices and with an evident\r\ndisposition under the present system to become a separate people,\r\nwould be gradually assimilated to the British population of\r\nboth Provinces; and with it moulded into one people of British\r\ncharacter and with British feelings. All opposition of interest\r\nand cause of difference between the Provinces would be forever\r\nextinguished: an efficient Legislature, capable of conciliating\r\nthe interests of the Colony with those of the Mother Colony, and\r\nproviding for the security and advancing the agricultural and\r\ncommercial prosperity of the country, would be established, by\r\nmeans of which the international improvement of both Provinces\r\nwould not only be rapidly promoted with the consequent benefits\r\nthereto arising from Great Britain, but the strength and capacity\r\nto resist foreign oppression be greatly increased: the tie of\r\nconnection between the Colony and the Parent State would be\r\nstrengthened and confirmed and a lasting dependence of the\r\nCanadas on the latter be ensured, to the mutual advantage of\r\nboth.”\r\n\r\nHaving given the British view of the situation it would only be\r\njust to give that of the other side. Analysis of their various\r\npetitions shows that they relied mainly on the wisdom of the\r\nGovernment in its past enactments which had been successful so\r\nthat the country was progressing in agriculture and commerce\r\nin spite of great obstacles. The differences that had arisen\r\nbetween Upper and Lower Canada relative to revenues were not in\r\nconsequence of the division of the two provinces but of temporary\r\ncauses which could easily be removed by the acts of the executive\r\nlegislature. The Union of the Provinces would only resuscitate\r\ndissension resulting from differences of language, religion,\r\nlaws and other local interests. The new bill was directed\r\nagainst the dearest interests of nine-tenths of the population\r\nof this province. Allusion was made to the injustice of the new\r\nbill which would make English the language of debate, would\r\nexclude many from being elected to the Assembly and would give\r\nhumiliating preference to the members of the Assembly from Upper\r\nCanada by affording the minority an equal representation with\r\nthose of the Lower Province, whose population was five times as\r\nnumerous.\r\n\r\nIt may be well here to allow the criticisms of Mr. L.J. Papineau\r\nto supply an element underlying the opposition of the opponents\r\nof the bill. In a letter to Mr. R.J. Wilmot, M.P., 23 Montague\r\nSquare, London, Mr. Papineau alluding, doubtless, to the Montreal\r\npro-union petition of which he had known, and speaking for\r\nhis committee, wishes to dispel the odious aspersions on the\r\ngreat body of the people in this province, contained in several\r\ncommunications intended for England: “such as assertions that\r\nthe opposition, manifested in this province on the part of the\r\npopulation so stigmatized, is the effect of prejudices alone;\r\nalluding to their supposed attachment for France and French\r\nprinciples; calling them foreigners (foreigners in their own\r\nland!). The bill in question, say these friends of the union,\r\nbeing so well calculated to Anglify the country which is to be\r\nultimately peopled by the British race. * * * The preposterous\r\ncalumny against the Canadians of French origin as to their\r\nsupposed attachment for France requires no further answer than\r\nthat which is derived from their uniform conduct during the wars\r\nand the loyalty evinced by them on every occasion. They are not\r\nforeigners in this, the land of their birth; they claim rights\r\nas British subjects in common with every other subject of His\r\nMajesty in these colonies. By what they call Anglifying the\r\ncountry is meant the depriving the great majority of the people\r\nof this province of all that is dear to men, their laws, usages,\r\ninstitutions and religion. An insignificant minority wish for\r\na change and are desirous of ruling against every principle of\r\njustice by destroying what they call Canadian influence, that is\r\nto say, the influence of the majority of men entitled to the same\r\nrights as themselves, of the great mass of the natives. * * * Great\r\nBritain wants no other Anglifying in this country than that which\r\nis to be found in the loyalty and affection of the inhabitants,\r\nno other British race than that of natural born subjects, loyal\r\nand affectionate.”\r\n\r\nThe opinion of the legislative council of Lower Canada is finally\r\nto be recorded. In its petition it gives its fixed and determined\r\nopinion that the union of the two legislatures in one would only\r\ntend directly to enfeeble and embarrass His Majesty’s government\r\nand finally to create discontent in the minds of His Majesty’s\r\nfaithful subjects in this colony. Upper Canada was quite\r\nsatisfied with the existing conditions. The chief agitators,\r\ntherefore, for the bill were to be found in Montreal and with\r\nthem sided the Eastern Townships.\r\n\r\nThe bill for the union was withdrawn. When it was brought up\r\nlater it was more wisely thought out. It did not tread on\r\nestablished prejudices and rights and it brought with it the\r\npanacea of true responsible government. But at the present date\r\nthis was not fully seen. The great objective was to become\r\nindependent of the colonial office by a representative and\r\nelective legislative council. It was hoped thus to control all\r\nexpenditures. Hence the members of the lower assembly, not\r\ncontent with the exercise of mere municipal legislation, were\r\never asserting their rights in the latter regard and the Colonial\r\nOffice as often, checking their aspirations.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             NOTE I\r\n\r\n      NAMES OF JUSTICES OF PEACE OF MONTREAL FROM 1796-1833\r\n\r\n  James McGill\r\n  John McKindlay\r\n  St. George Dupré\r\n  Charles Blake\r\n  Louis Porlier\r\n  Thomas McCord\r\n  Pierre Vallèe\r\n  John Lilly\r\n  Robert Cruickshank\r\n  Patrick Murray\r\n  John McGill\r\n  James Finlay\r\n  Neveu Sylvestre\r\n  Alexander Henry\r\n  Gabriel Franchere\r\n  James Walker\r\n  James Alexander Grant\r\n  Joseph Frobisher\r\n  John Richardson\r\n  Isaac Winslow Clarke\r\n  Alexander Auldjo\r\n  William Maitland\r\n  James Hughes\r\n  Simon McTavish\r\n  James Dunlop\r\n  Thomas Forsyth\r\n  John Lees\r\n  Louis Chaboillez\r\n  Jean P.

The act was challenged\r\nin the house of Quebec, but to no avail. In 1824 the president of\r\nthe United States claimed the free navigation of the St. Lawrence\r\nto the ocean. This was objected to by the legislative council as\r\npernicious to the interests of British trade and the merchants\r\nof Montreal in a petition of February 20, 1826, combatted the\r\nadmission of the claim.\r\n\r\nThe constitutional record of the next few years of Montreal\r\nshows the growth of contention between the English and French\r\npopulation. In 1828 this came temporarily to a head in the\r\npetition and counter petition for the recall of Lord Dalhousie,\r\nthe Governor General. Messrs. Denis B. Viger and Cuvillier were\r\nthe bearers of a petition from Montreal. Lord Dalhousie was in\r\nconsequence appointed commander in chief in India. At a banquet\r\nheld in Montreal on June 7, 1828, with the Hon. John Richardson\r\nin the chair, a farewell was given to Lord Dalhousie prior to his\r\nleaving Canada, approving of his just government.\r\n\r\nIn 1831 a movement began to be advocated, especially in Upper\r\nCanada, that the island of Montreal should be separated from the\r\nLower province and added to the Upper, so that this might have\r\na seaport of its own, with power to regulate the duty on the\r\nimports without interference from Quebec. It was argued that in a\r\nfew years the Upper province would be in advance of Lower Canada\r\nin agriculture and population. The movement found favour among\r\nthe British party in Montreal but was strongly resented by those\r\nof French-Canadian birth. The house in session in 1832 rejected\r\nit as a premeditated and unprovoked spoilation in violation of\r\nthe Capitulation treaty. This year, Montreal was incorporated as\r\na city with a charter. (William V, Cap. 39.)\r\n\r\nIt was a charge against the legislative council that it consisted\r\nlargely of officials holding their places at the pleasure of the\r\ncrown and therefore irresponsible to the people and subversive\r\nof its interests. A view of the position of the legislative\r\ncouncil may be seen from the returns that Gov. Gen. Sir James\r\nKempt (1828-1830) was requested to furnish to the colonial\r\noffice. These showed that the legislative council consisted of\r\ntwenty-three members, twelve of whom held office under the crown,\r\nsixteen were Protestants and seven Roman Catholics. The executive\r\ncouncil consisted of nine members, only one being unconnected\r\nwith government, and all were Protestants with one exception.\r\n\r\nIn order to gain confidence and to remove the suspicion that the\r\nlegislative council was under the influence of local government\r\nand guided in its proceedings by the will of the Governor, which\r\nhe alleged to be an absolute misrepresentation, Sir James advised\r\nthat one or two of the most important of the assemblymen should\r\nbe advanced to the legislature.\r\n\r\nLord Aylmer, who succeeded Sir James Kempt, in a private letter\r\nto Mr. Hay said, on the other hand, that the impression on\r\nthe public mind was that a sinister influence was continually\r\noperating on the governor, who was being swayed to a very great\r\nextent by the executive council; although this was not the case,\r\nhe thought the public should be satisfied on that head. But he\r\nagreed that Mr. Papineau and Mr. Neilson should be advanced. He\r\ndisapproved of Mr. Papineau’s public conduct and language, though\r\nhe esteemed his private character. “There is,” he wrote to Mr.\r\nHay, “one consideration which, more than any other, renders it\r\ndesirable, in my view of the matter, to make choice of these\r\ngentlemen. A very general opinion prevails in this country that\r\nthe person at the head of the government is always more or less\r\ninfluenced by the executive council which, whether justly or\r\notherwise, I will not take it upon myself to say, is not held in\r\ngeneral estimation, and it appears to me that the introduction\r\nof two gentlemen enjoying like Mr. Papineau and Neilson the\r\nconfidence of the public, into that body and, as it were, behind\r\nthe scenes, would go far towards removing the opinion alluded to,\r\nand which I can positively state, as far as regards myself, is\r\nwholly without foundation.”[1]\r\n\r\nIn 1832 a vacancy occurred in the west ward of Montreal by\r\nthe resignation of Mr. Fisher. As it reflects the turbulent\r\nconflicts that had been going on so long in the House at Quebec\r\nand indicates the high pitch of excitement to which minds were\r\nthen brought, a lengthy notice is not out of place. It also\r\nforeshadowed the violent scenes of 1837. The candidates were\r\nMr. Stanley Bagg, a representative of one of the oldest British\r\nfirms in Montreal who shared in the views of British party, and\r\nDoctor Tracy, an Irishman attached to the “Vindicator” which had\r\nespoused the extreme views of the assembly; indeed, he had been\r\nrecently imprisoned for his censures on the legislative council.\r\nThe contest was very close and lasted for some days. On May\r\n21st, when Doctor Tracy was a few votes ahead, there was every\r\nappearance of a riot around the polls. The Fifteenth Regiment\r\nwas called out, the riot act was read but the tumult continued.\r\nThe account given by Kingsford’s History of Canada, Volume IX,\r\npp. 481-99, tells graphically what follows. As the poll was\r\nbeing closed the partisans of Tracy, headed by himself, rushed\r\nagainst those of the opposite side. The troops were now ordered\r\nto advance and reached the old Montreal Bank, the site of the\r\npresent postoffice. The troops were received with volley after\r\nvolley of stone. Colonel McIntosh called to the mob to cease\r\nthis aggressiveness, or he would give orders to fire. The troops\r\ncontinued to advance up St. James Street, giving opportunity for\r\nthe mob to retire. The stones continued to be thrown. A second\r\nhalt was made. The crowd, now composed almost entirely of Tracy’s\r\nsupporters, had greatly increased. The attack upon the military\r\ncontinued. Again Colonel McIntosh threatened to give the order\r\nto fire. According to the evidence of the lieutenant present,\r\nMr. W. Dawson, from whose testimony this narrative is taken,\r\nseveral men in the ranks were severely hurt by these missiles.\r\nThe colonel was struck, as was the subaltern. Colonel McIntosh,\r\nstill hesitating to act, again warned his assailants. It was\r\nall in vain. To judge by the testimony given at the inquest the\r\nmob evidently believed that the military would not dare to act.\r\nThey were cruelly mistaken. The first platoon of sixteen men\r\nwere ordered to fire; three of the crowd fell dead, two were\r\nwounded. In a few seconds the street was cleared. * * * It was\r\nthe first event of this character in Canada and caused a great\r\nsensation. From the violence shown it was dreaded that the riot\r\nmight continue. The consequence was that a detachment with some\r\nfield pieces was stationed at the Place d’Armes. During the night\r\npickets paraded the streets. The _Minerve_ in its continuation\r\nof abuse described the event as the massacre of peaceable,\r\nunarmed citizens, and that in order to make the military forget\r\ntheir crime they had been abundantly supplied with rum. * * *\r\nNo arrests were made. * * * The coroner’s inquest was held. Mr.\r\nPapineau attended every day.[2] * * * Nine witnesses testified\r\nthat the soldiers fired upon the people as they were dispersing\r\nafter the close of the poll. Three witnesses described the act as\r\nthe consequence of the riot. No verdict was given.[3] * * * The\r\ncoroner, nevertheless, issued warrants for the arrest of McIntosh\r\nand Temple. They were immediately bailed to the amount of £1,000.\r\nThe proceedings of the coroner were set aside as illegal, but the\r\nmatter did not stop here. These officers were again arrested and\r\nsubjected to much annoyance. Finally, in September, the grand\r\njury returned the indictment with “no bill.” The same result was\r\nobtained in the case of the magistrates, Messrs. Robertson and\r\nLukin, indicted on a similar criminal charge as having given\r\norders to the troops.\r\n\r\nThe action of the military was approved by the grand jury, and\r\nby the commander in chief, the latter being further commended by\r\nLord Fitzroy Somerset through Lord Aylmer, the governor general.\r\nAn address of sympathetic citizens was presented to the two\r\nofficers. La Minerve on the 24th of May, 1832, however, was\r\nimplacable. “It is difficult,” it says, “not to be convinced\r\nthat there was a desire to make a general massacre. It is\r\nclearly proved that the faction hostile to the Canadians has\r\nbeen preparing for this atrocity for a long time. The party\r\nthat we have opposed for thirty years desired today to shoot\r\nus down. * * * They also wished to shoot Mr. Tracy. * * * Mr.\r\nBagg’s partisans laughingly approached the corpses and saw with\r\nfierce joy the Canadian blood flowing down the street. They have\r\nbeen seen shaking hands congratulatingly and regretting that the\r\nnumber of the dead was not greater. * * * Let us never forget the\r\nmassacre of our brethren. * * * Let the names of the wrongdoers\r\nwho have planned, advised and executed this crime be inscribed in\r\nour annals handed down to infamy and execration.”[4] (History of\r\nCanada, page 109.)\r\n\r\nThe funeral of the three Canadians was attended by about five\r\nthousand persons and following the bodies were Mr. Papineau, the\r\nspeaker of the assembly, the leader of the French-Canadian party\r\nand his chief supporters.\r\n\r\nFrom this date the tone of the newspapers Le Spectateur at Quebec\r\nand La Minerve at Montreal is noticeably inflammatory in the\r\ndemand for the redress of their grievances. On the other hand,\r\nthe English papers representing the British party, especially\r\nthe Gazette and Herald of Montreal, dealt no uncertain blows\r\nin return and Mr. Papineau fared ill. He was looked upon as a\r\ndemagogue inciting dissension and making political capital from\r\nthe late misfortune of May 21st.\r\n\r\nThe memory of the riot was not allowed to die down in the\r\nneighbourhood of Montreal and elsewhere. At Longueuil on June\r\n11th a resolution, provoked by the affair of May 21st, set\r\nforth that “the British government deceived by men who are our\r\nenvenomed enemies, are following in a line of conduct leading\r\nto our destruction and slavery; that the fate of the Acadians\r\nis being prepared for us, that the neglect of the frequent\r\ndemands of our rights on the part of England had tended to break\r\nthe contract between her and us.” In these and other meetings\r\nthere was generally a protest against granting to capitalists\r\nindependently of the colonial legislature a large portion of the\r\nuncultivated lands of the crown. This was aimed at members of the\r\nBritish party.\r\n\r\nAnother protest was at immigration from Great Britain. The\r\nparishes were being inoculated with discontent. This last was\r\nemphasized at this period especially, as in 1832 Canada was\r\nsuffering from cholera; from June 9th to September 30th, the\r\nnumber described as having died being 3,292. It was at this date\r\nthat Gross Ile, thirty miles below Quebec, was established by\r\nthe provincial executive as a quarantine station on the warning\r\nfrom the home government, having itself suffered its ravages\r\nin the winter of 1831-2. The disease was thought to have been\r\nbrought early in June by the “Carrick” with emigrants from Dublin\r\ncontaining 133 passengers, of whom fifty-nine had died on the\r\nvoyage. The malady is supposed to have quickly spread from the\r\nemigrants to others through Quebec and Montreal. Apparently\r\nthe disease did not spread in Upper Canada to any extent. The\r\nboards of health lately established did all they could, by the\r\nestablishment of hospitals, to stay the disease. The Montreal\r\nboard of health reported on the 26th day of June that there had\r\nbeen from the 10th to the 25th of June inclusive 3,384 cases and\r\n947 deaths. The Fifteenth Regiment suffered severely. But at the\r\nend of June the disease was abating. A correspondent writing from\r\nMontreal on the 25th of June said that the printers, like others,\r\nhad deserted their work a fortnight before, but at the date he\r\nwrote activity was resumed, the stores were again opened and the\r\nmarkets better supplied. On the 6th of July Lord Aylmer wrote:\r\n“The panic in the public mind is rapidly subsiding and the people\r\nare returning to their ordinary occupations, which at one period\r\nof the prevalence of the disease were almost entirely abandoned.”\r\nThe arrival of emigrants during 1831 and 1832 had been numerous.\r\nThe official returns for 1831 and 1832 give the numbers as being\r\n48,973 and 49,281.\r\n\r\nAt Montreal the seriousness of the political and social situation\r\nand the menaces that were looming to the peace and to the\r\nsecurity of life and property, was not blinked. Moderate men of\r\nboth parties already heard the rumblings of the revolt of 1837.\r\nA meeting was held at the British American Hotel on the 4th of\r\nNovember with 500 persons present. Mr. Horatio Gates, a prominent\r\nmerchant, was in the chair and many other important men discussed\r\nthe situation earnestly. A committee was formed to draft the\r\npetition, to the throne, based on the resolutions of the meeting.\r\nThe names reveal the inclusion of weighty French-Canadians: “J.C.\r\nGrant, Hypolite Guy, Alex Buchanan, Jules Quesnel, George Auldjo,\r\nTurton Penn, Pierre Bibaud, Dr. W. Caldwell, Dr. B. Rollin,\r\nAugustin Perreault, T.B. Anderson, Felix Souligny, Joseph Masson,\r\nand J.T. Barrett.”\r\n\r\nBriefly the resolutions expressed confidence in the present\r\nsystem of government, desiring no change in the system of\r\nthe legislative council which was an essential product of\r\nthe legislature; it was stated that the political excitement\r\nof disaffected persons was creating a want of confidence in\r\nthe security of property and had embarrassed all commercial\r\nrelations, and it was felt now a boundened duty “to declare their\r\nunalterable attachment to the government, etc.”\r\n\r\nThis action at Montreal was offset by a petition from Montreal\r\nconsidered in the session, praying for constitutional changes; it\r\ndemanded an elective government in every department; it protested\r\nagainst any system of emigration which, while being beneficial\r\nto the Upper Province was not so to the Lower. It assailed the\r\nofficials for the proceedings consequent upon the riot of May\r\n21st at Montreal. Mr. Leslie, a British merchant of Montreal and\r\nextreme supporter of Mr. Papineau, moved the inquiry into the\r\naffairs of the 21st. On this occasion Mr. Andrew Stewart threw\r\nit into the face of Mr. Papineau that he was creating national\r\ndistinctions, that he had given rise to the consternation\r\nwhich he felt, when he should have shown moderation. During\r\nthis session Mr. Neilson also took a decided stand against Mr.\r\nPapineau, the first step towards a break in their political\r\nrelationship. The discussion on the events of May 21, 1832, was\r\ndeferred to next session. The house was prorogued on April 3,\r\n1833.\r\n\r\nThis year, 1833, was remarkable as that of coming into effect\r\nof the municipal act of Montreal and Quebec, a forward movement\r\ntreated of elsewhere. During the session of 1834 the famous\r\nNinety-two Resolutions introduced by Mr. Bibaud kept up the\r\nagitation for change and redress. In 1834 Mr. Roebuck, who had\r\nleft Canada in 1825 and had, as member for Bath, moved in April,\r\n1834, in the house of parliament in London for the appointment\r\nof a committee to enquire into the means of remedying the evils\r\nin the government of Upper and Lower Canada, took a step which\r\nlargely fanned the fire of discontent in Montreal. Addressing\r\nthe united and permanent committee of the reform party of\r\nMontreal in favour of self-government as then meditated through a\r\nrepresentative elective legislative council, he advised them to\r\nresist the parliament of Great Britain. He advocated peaceable\r\nmethods before taking to arms. But they had to fight sooner than\r\nlose all hope of self-government.\r\n\r\nThis infused, if possible, more vigour to the pens of the\r\nwriters in La Minerve and the Vindicator, of which Doctor\r\nO’Callaghan was editor.[5] Violent attacks on the government\r\nwere renewed. French-Canadians were urged to organize for the\r\nrevolutionary movement. The moderate French-Canadians were\r\nfearful of the outcome. The British party, in self-defence,\r\nprepared a petition, and a deputation to Quebec to Lord Aylmer\r\nwith an address conceived in opposition to the spirit of the\r\nNinety-two Resolutions. On August 24th Mr. Hume presented Mr.\r\nBibaud’s Ninety-two Resolutions to the imperial parliament signed\r\nby 18,083 persons. On the 24th of September the supporters of\r\nthe Ninety-two Resolutions met and supported resolutions on the\r\nsame lines. Among those present was Girod as a delegate from\r\nVerchères; he was a strong adherent of Papineau and later, in\r\n1838, was one of the leaders in the insurrection of St. Eustace.\r\n\r\nIn October and November the elections took place. In the west\r\nward of Montreal Papineau and Dr. Robert Nelson were declared\r\nelected by the returning officer Lusignan before the legal time\r\nfor the close of the polls had arrived. A protest was made by Mr.\r\nWalker and Mr. Donnellan, the opposing candidates, without avail.\r\nA few days later Mr. Papineau issued a fiery philippic--a common\r\ncustom of his--against the Governor General with the effect when\r\nLord Aylmer visited Montreal later, La Minerve and the Vindicator\r\nappeared with their columns in mourning. In Quebec the new city\r\ncouncil had the insolence to pass a vote not to pay the “visite\r\nde cérémonie” to Lord Aylmer on New Year’s Day.\r\n\r\nDuring November Constitutional Associations were formed in\r\nMontreal and Quebec by the British party who now feared a\r\nseparation with the mother country. At Montreal an address was\r\nprepared as a result of a public meeting on November 22d to men\r\nof “British and Irish descent.” It was signed by John Molson,\r\nJr., and was directed to their fellow countrymen of the Province\r\nof British America for their oppressed brethren of Montreal, and\r\nsolicited their “attention to a brief and temperate exposition\r\nof our principles and grievances.” It is a lengthy statement\r\ncontaining about three thousand words, though not so long as\r\nthe grievances of the Ninety-two Resolutions, which occupied\r\ntwenty-five pages of the journals of the house in 1834. As we\r\nhave not reproduced the latter neither do we those of the British\r\nparty, though a perusal of each would give a vivid picture of\r\nthe seriousness of the situation and the tension on both sides.\r\nIt was the conflict of two mentalities become, for the time,\r\nhopelessly irreconcilable and highly inflamed by the vision\r\nof their real or imaginary grievances and injustices. It was\r\ncommercial progress and British expansion versus a conservative\r\nagriculturalism and a “nation Canadienne” for Lower Canada.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Drawn by John Murray. ABOUT 1845 St. James Street,\r\nWest. The Bank of Montreal on the right]\r\n\r\nIn February of 1835 the new parliament met. Its proceedings are\r\nmore marked with the signs of the anarchy so soon to become a\r\nthing of fact. In answer to the Governor’s address there was\r\ndemanded in the name “of the great body of the people without\r\ndistinction, the introduction of the elective principles for\r\nthe legislative council.” A petition was also prepared for the\r\nking, in which it was claimed that the people at large “fully\r\nparticipated in the opinions of the majority of the house.”\r\nThe real proportion of the constituencies for and against the\r\nNinety-two Resolutions was less than three to one,[6] the country\r\nparishes largely contributing to this result. The house was\r\nprorogued on March 18th, having sat only twenty-five days.\r\n\r\nScenting trouble, the “constitutional associations” of Quebec and\r\nMontreal prepared to meet emergencies. Branches were multiplied\r\nin other places when possible. Circulars to public bodies and\r\nprominent men over Canada were diffused. The interest and aid of\r\nthe United States were canvassed. The statement of grievances\r\nfrom Montreal signed by John Molson was a dangerous precedent.\r\nLeading men in London were approached. To meet the activity of\r\nMr. Roebuck, who had recently been appointed an agent for the\r\nreform party, Mr. Neilson was sent to present a petition to the\r\nking from Quebec, and Mr. William Walker that of Montreal. They\r\nleft _via_ New York in April. Mr. Roebuck presented the counter\r\npetition of the House of Assembly to the House of Commons on\r\nMarch 9, 1835. That from Montreal was presented by Mr. Stuart on\r\nMarch 16th.\r\n\r\nThe Canadian difficulties were now so notorious that the king\r\ndetermined to send an extraordinary commissioner. Lord Gosford\r\nwas finally appointed and with him were associated Sir Charles\r\nGrey and Sir George Gibbs. These arrived at Quebec on August 23d.\r\nOn September 17th Lord Aylmer with his family left for England.\r\nHis term of office had been stormy but while vituperation fell\r\nupon him on one hand, he was otherwise sustained by the strong\r\nminority. Lord Gosford came with a policy of conciliation openly\r\nmanifested and openly rejected. He met his parliament within\r\ntwo months after his arrival. His opening speech as governor\r\ngeneral, the longest on record on such an occasion, was delivered\r\non October 27, 1835. He unfolded his theory of conciliation\r\nand promises of redresses of grievances. The house, however,\r\nwas tuned up only for extremes and showed no readiness for\r\ncompromise. This lesson has been since well learned, experience\r\nof the failure of any other course having been abundant. The\r\nconcluding words of Lord Gosford’s speech are noteworthy and\r\nimpressive. “To the Canadians, both of French and British\r\norigin, and every class and description, I would say, consider\r\nthe blessings you might enjoy and the favoured situation in\r\nwhich but for your own dissensions you would find yourselves\r\nto be placed. The offsprings of the two foremost nations of\r\nmankind, you hold a vast and beautiful country, a fertile soil,\r\na healthy climate and the noblest river in the world makes your\r\nmost remote city a port for the ships of the sea. Your revenue is\r\ntriple the amount of your expenditure for the ordinary purposes\r\nof government. You have no direct taxes, no public debt, no poor\r\nwho require any aid more than the natural impulses of charity.\r\nIf you extend your views beyond the land in which you dwell you\r\nfind that you are joint inheritors of the splendid patrimony of\r\nthe British empire which constitutes you in the best sense of\r\nthe term citizens of the world and gives you a home on every\r\ncontinent and in every ocean on the globe. There are two paths\r\nopen to you. By the one you will advance to the enjoyment of all\r\nthe advantages which lie in prospect before you. By the other\r\nI will say no more than you will stop short of these, and will\r\nengage yourselves and those who have no other object than your\r\nprosperity in darker and more difficult courses.”\r\n\r\nThe existence of the Commission was studiously ignored by the\r\nAssembly. But on the 6th of November an amendment to the draft\r\nin answer to the address was moved, approving of the appointment\r\nof the commission as a proof of the wisdom and magnanimity with\r\n“which the grievances of the province had been listened to,\r\nand now confidently hope that the results of its labours will\r\nbe satisfactory to all classes.”[7] Mr. Papineau vehemently\r\nattacked the motion. The commissioners were without legal or\r\nconstitutional power. Their report, favourable or not, was\r\nimmaterial. The motion was voted down by forty-five to eight. The\r\ngovernor general’s position as such was, however, recognized.\r\n\r\nThe “Constitutional” associations of Montreal and Quebec,\r\ncomposed of those who held substantially by the existing\r\nconstitution with certain reforms dictated by expediency, were\r\nmeanwhile viewing with dissatisfaction the intransigeant attitude\r\nof the majority of the house. At Montreal it was proposed by the\r\nBritish population to raise a volunteer corps of 800 strong.\r\nA memorial was sent at the close of December to the Governor\r\nGeneral asking for official sanction for the enrollment and\r\noffering its services to the Government. It was not granted\r\non the grounds that no rights were in danger and that the\r\nenrollment would endanger public tranquillity. The organization\r\nwas proceeded with. Lord Gosford issued a proclamation declaring\r\nit illegal and unconstitutional. The corps was dissolved and in\r\nnotifying Lord Gosford he was informed that “As committee men\r\nof the British Rifle Corps we must express to Your Excellency\r\nour regrets that the day has arrived when, in a colony conquered\r\nby British arms, a body of loyal subjects has been treated as\r\ntraitors by a British Governor General for no other crime than\r\nthat of rousing themselves to protect their persons and property\r\nand to assist in maintaining the rights and privileges granted\r\nthem by the constitution.”\r\n\r\nIn addition a meeting was called and a memorial sent to Lord\r\nGosford justifying their conduct on the grounds that the\r\nconstitution was endangered. They would always be ready to\r\ndefend British institutions.[8] It is said that the Doric Club,\r\na more or less secret society of Britishers, now dated its\r\nformation.\r\n\r\nThe policy of conciliation was meeting a rebuff on both sides.\r\nThe Montreal “Vindicator” later even spoke of “the treacherous\r\nadministration of Lord Gosford.”\r\n\r\nOn the 21st of March, 1836, the parliament was prorogued. There\r\nwas the same stubborn determination of the majority of the\r\nassembly to assert itself to overrule the existing constitution\r\nand thus control the situation on the lines of the Ninety-Two\r\nResolutions so as to make government impossible. It met again on\r\nSeptember 22d. No bills were passed; two were introduced, one\r\nfor the appointment of an agent in London, another to amend the\r\nImperial act of 1791 (an unconstitutional proceeding beyond the\r\npowers of the assembly), with a view of establishing an elective\r\nlegislative assembly directly responsible to the representatives\r\nof the people. This appeal for “responsible” government as it\r\nwas then vaguely conceived, was always steadfastly pursued as\r\nthe basic reform needed to solve all the other grievances under\r\nwhich the province was suffering. The aim was self-government and\r\nthe abolition of the bureaucracy and privileged class incidental\r\non an appointed legislative council chosen by the Crown. After a\r\nshort session of thirteen days in all, the house was prorogued on\r\nOctober 4th. The parliament of Lower Canada met again on August\r\n18, 1837, but as its members would not transact any business at\r\nall, it was prorogued on August 20th, never to meet again.\r\n\r\nThe annual meeting of the Montreal Constitutional Association\r\nmet in December, 1835. Ward committees were appointed. Among\r\nthe principles to be advocated was the abolition of the feudal\r\ntenure, the continued improvement of the harbour of Montreal\r\nand of the canal communications. In February, 1836, Sir John\r\nColborne was relieved of his position as Lieutenant Governor\r\nof Upper Canada. Before embarking for England he was appointed\r\nCommander-in-Chief of the forces in both provinces. On July 1st\r\nhe issued a general order from Montreal on the assumption of\r\ncommand. In June a movement of a “Constitutional” committee was\r\nafoot in Montreal for the recall of Lord Gosford. It dropped,\r\nhowever, on opposition from the Quebec Constitutional party.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[1] “Canadian Archives,” Q. 197, p. 78; see report by Dr. Brymner\r\nfor 1899.\r\n\r\n[2] The Quebec Gazette justified Mr. Papineau’s being present as\r\nhe was acting in his profession as an advocate.\r\n\r\n[3] These were French Canadians.\r\n\r\n[4] Bibaud, “History of Canada,” Vol. III, p. 109.\r\n\r\n[5] Dr. O’Callaghan was subsequently returned to the house of\r\nassembly in the new parliament of 1835 as the representative\r\nof Yamaska. There he was unknown but Mr. Papineau’s influence\r\ncarried the seat. In the subsequent parliament he became a\r\nstaunch lieutenant of his leader.\r\n\r\n[6] Mr. Jacques Viger, the first mayor of Montreal and also\r\na conscientious historian and archaeologist, made a concise\r\nstatement of the political strength of the opposing parties in\r\nthe counties, towns and boroughs as recorded in the votes at\r\nthe last election for and against the spirit of the Ninety-Two\r\nResolutions on which the election turned.\r\n\r\n                 For                 Against                Not Voting\r\n\r\n              361,801½               115,838                 35,619½\r\n\r\n  Quebec        7,120½ (i.e. ¼)       20,148½ (i.e. ¾)\r\n\r\n  Montreal     13,714  (i.e. ½)        6,254  (i.e. ¼)\r\n\r\nOne-fourth did not vote, owing to the vacancy in the seat of one\r\nof the representatives.

They were eventually doubtless useful to Lord Dunham\r\nin the preparation of his report. The commissioners considered\r\nan elective legislative council undesirable but they formulated\r\na system of representative government on lines which we now\r\nunderstand. While granting the government of internal affairs it\r\nstrove to preserve the unity of empire.\r\n\r\n[8] In the Imperial parliament in 1837 Mr. Robinson quoted La\r\nMinerve of Montreal, which stated that immediate separation\r\nfrom England was the only means of preserving French Canadian\r\nnationality.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                          CHAPTER XVII\r\n\r\n               MONTREAL IN THE THROES OF CIVIL WAR\r\n\r\n                            1837-1838\r\n\r\n  THE LEGISLATIVE COUNCIL TO REMAIN CROWN-APPOINTED--THE SIGNAL FOR\r\n    REVOLT--FIRST INSURRECTIONARY MEETING AT ST.

On March 6th, Lord\r\nJohn Russell introduced ten resolutions, which passed. The fourth\r\nstated that it was inadvisable to make the legislative council\r\nof Canada an elective body, but that measures should be taken\r\nto secure for it a greater degree of public confidence, and\r\nthe fifth, that while expedient to improve the composition of\r\nthe executive council, it was inadvisable to subject it to the\r\nresponsibility demanded by the house of assembly.\r\n\r\nThe news was received with welcome by the British constitutional\r\nparty who had clung tenaciously to the crown-appointed executive\r\nas their only hope of adequate representation in the government\r\nof the province. To the national party it came as a signal for\r\nrevolt. On May 7th, the first insurrectionary meeting was held\r\nat St. Ours, Dr. Wolfred Nelson having a large share in its\r\nconvention. Mr. L.J. Papineau was acclaimed as an O’Connell,\r\na man called by God as the regenerator of his nation. Other\r\nmeetings now began in the parishes of the Montreal district\r\nand Mr. Papineau left his home in Montreal for his mission of\r\nagitation.\r\n\r\nOn July 6th the constitutional party held a meeting in the\r\nPlace d’Armes. On the motion of the Hon. Peter McGill, the Hon.\r\nGeorge Moffatt took the chair. Messrs. Quesnel and de Bleury\r\nwere elected vice presidents. Among the resolutions proposed\r\nwere those of the necessity of the connections with the mother\r\ncountry for the prosperity and advancement of the colony and the\r\nnecessity of resisting any attempts at dismemberment. A similar\r\nmeeting was held at Quebec on July 31st, on which day the news of\r\nthe death of William IV reached Canada. On August 1st Victoria\r\nwas proclaimed Queen of British North America.\r\n\r\nThe country districts outside of Montreal were fomenting\r\nrevolt. At St. Eustache and St. Benoit “anti-coercion” meetings\r\nwere held, as well as at Napierville, seven miles west of the\r\nRichelieu. On August 18th the last parliament of Lower Canada was\r\ncalled but was prorogued on the members refusing to legislate\r\nbecause of want of confidence in the Imperial government in\r\nLondon through its failure to grant their demands. Forty years\r\nlater the House of Assembly was reestablished as that of the\r\nProvince of Quebec. The proceedings of the last assembly\r\nwere regarded by the constitutional association as a virtual\r\nannihilation of the constitution and an address was issued on\r\nSeptember 4th to this effect and signed by the Hon. Peter McGill\r\nand Mr. Badgley as secretary. This address given in full in the\r\nMontreal Gazette on the 9th of September advocates the union of\r\nthe legislatures of the two provinces as affording a solution by\r\ngiving a fair share of proportional representation to the British\r\npopulation.\r\n\r\nOn the 5th of September the new society “Les Fils de Liberté”\r\nheld a meeting in Montreal. The members were to meet as a\r\nmilitary corps with arms for the purpose of being drilled\r\nas if under sanction of the government. Its motto was to be\r\n“En Avant!” On October 1st it published a manifesto of which\r\ncertain paragraphs clearly disclose its seditionary purpose.\r\n“The authority of a parent state over a colony can only exist\r\nduring the pleasure of the colonists; for the country, being\r\nestablished and settled by them, belongs to them by right and\r\nmay be separated from all foreign connection, whenever the\r\ninconveniences, resulting from an executive power residing abroad\r\nand ceasing to harmonize with the local legislature, makes such a\r\nstep necessary to the inhabitants for the pursuit of happiness.”\r\nAgain: “The separation as commenced between parties which will\r\nnever be cemented but which will go on increasing until one of\r\nthose sudden, those unforeseen events that attend the march\r\nof time, affords us a fit opportunity for assuming our rank\r\namong the independent sovereignties of America. Two splendid\r\nopportunities have been lost. Let us not be unprepared for the\r\nthird.”\r\n\r\nWriting on October 6th Sir John Colborne, an old Peninsular\r\nveteran who had fought at Waterloo and was now the commander\r\nin chief of the forces, says: “The game which Mr. Papineau is\r\nplaying cannot be mistaken and we must be prepared to expect that\r\nif four hundred or five hundred persons be allowed to parade the\r\nstreets of Montreal at night, singing revolutionary songs, the\r\nexcited parties will come in collision.” On the 7th of October\r\nthe offer of a British rifle corps in Montreal was again politely\r\ndeclined. Yet those of British, Irish and United States origin\r\nwere facing the inevitable conflict foreseen by them.\r\n\r\nIt soon came. On October 23d a meeting took place at St. Charles\r\non the Richelieu. Dr. Wolfred Nelson took the chair. Mr.\r\nPapineau, Thomas Storrow Brown, L.M. Viger, Lacoste, Coté, Girod,\r\nand others, being present among the speakers. It was a fine\r\nday and the militia were there. Flags in abundance streamed out\r\nwith inscriptions such as “Long live Papineau and the elective\r\nsystem!” “Down with Debartzch!”[1] “Independence, Lord of the\r\nEagle Heart and Lion Eye!” “The Canadians know how to die but\r\nnot to surrender!” “Papineau and the Majority of the House of\r\nAssembly!” “An elective council, a _sine qua non_ of liberty: I\r\nwill conquer or die for her!” A death’s head and cross-bones with\r\nthe words “Legislative Council.” (See Montreal Gazette, Tuesday,\r\n31st October, 1837.)\r\n\r\nIt is said that on this occasion Papineau, fearing the excitement\r\nprevalent, counseled moderation, but Wolfred Nelson rejoined:\r\n“Well, I differ from Mr. Papineau. I think the time has come to\r\nmelt our spoons and make balls of them.” A wooden pillar with a\r\ncap of liberty was erected with an inscription in French that\r\nwas dedicated to Papineau by his grateful brother patriots of\r\n1837. Lengthy resolutions were passed of no uncertain seditionary\r\ntendency. The British soldiers were encouraged to desert and\r\nassistance was promised. On the same day a great meeting of\r\nconstitutionalists was held in Montreal with Peter McGill in the\r\nchair; 7,000 persons were said to be present. The note struck\r\nwas the need of organization in anticipation of crimes now\r\nthreatening civil life. On this occasion the Irish, abhorring\r\nattempts to connect them with the rebellious party, declared\r\ntheir readiness to repel by force, if necessary, the enemies of\r\nthe constitution.\r\n\r\nNext day, October 24th, Monseigneur Lartigue, who had become the\r\nfirst Catholic bishop of Montreal on September 8, 1835, issued a\r\nmandement taking the view that revolt to constituted authorities\r\nwas against the doctrine of the Catholic church. It condemned the\r\nproceedings of the revolutionary leaders at public meetings. He\r\nbade the faithful not to be seduced, and called upon the country\r\nto reflect on the horrors of civil war. On November 6th what Sir\r\nJohn Colborne had feared, took place. The Doric Club, a kind\r\nof secret society recently founded and joined by a number of\r\nthe British and Irish young men, met the “Fils de Liberté.” It\r\nhad been reported that the “Fils de Liberté” were to proceed in\r\nprocession and to hold a demonstration in the Place d’Armes and\r\nthere plant a tree of liberty. A proclamation was issued calling\r\nupon all to refrain from the procession. About 2 o’clock the\r\n“Fils de Liberté” began to muster at Bonacina’s Tavern at the\r\ncorner of St. James and McGill streets, opposite the American\r\nchurch which then stood there. A party of “loyalists” watching\r\nthe proceedings provoked the “Fils de Liberté” to chase them\r\nup St. James street, breaking the windows of the loyalists’\r\nhouses, among them being that of Doctor Robertson. The members\r\nof the Doric Club now came to the rescue, changing the face of\r\naffairs and driving the opponents “pell mell” down St. Lawrence\r\nMain Street in confusion until they were dispersed. In the early\r\ncourse of the fracas “Gen.” Thomas Storrow Brown, a leader, or at\r\nleast a sympathizer of the “Fils de Liberté,” received an injury\r\nwhich resulted in the loss of an eye.\r\n\r\nThe riot act was read in the afternoon and the First Royals and\r\nthe artillery, with some field guns, marched through the streets\r\nheaded by two French-Canadian magistrates, Mr. Desrivières and\r\nMr. John Donegani. The loyalists marched to Bonsecours Street and\r\nwere, with difficulty, restrained from attacking Mr. Papineau’s\r\nhouse. The office of the Vindicator on St. Lambert’s Hill, near\r\nFortification Lane, was gutted, type, presses, paper, etc., being\r\nthrown into the street.\r\n\r\nThis paper in the reform and malcontent interest had made\r\nitself particularly obnoxious to the constitutionalists. Such\r\nincitements as the following had been appearing in its columns:\r\n“Henceforth there must be no peace in the province, no quarter\r\nfor the plunderers. Agitate! Agitate!! Agitate!!! Destroy the\r\nrevenues; denounce the oppressors. Everything is lawful when\r\nthe fundamental liberties are endangered. The guards die,\r\nthey never surrender.” During that night the main guard was\r\nstrengthened; pickets were placed on St. Lawrence Main, Place\r\nd’Armes and in the Quebec suburbs. The Montreal Royal Artillery\r\npatroled the streets and Griffintown was paraded by a body of\r\nindependent mechanics. On November 9th Sir John made Montreal his\r\nheadquarters and his firm conduct gave confidence in contrast\r\nwith the dilatory methods of Lord Gosford. Soon Montreal began\r\nto receive fugitives from the parishes, many of these being\r\nmagistrates and militia officers and others under government who\r\nhad been forced by threats to resign.\r\n\r\nOn the 12th of November a proclamation was issued against\r\nmeetings for military drills. All public assemblies and\r\nprocessions were forbidden. Volunteer corps of riflemen,\r\nartillery and cavalry were now raised under the authority of the\r\nGovernment. A new commission of the peace was issued for the\r\nMontreal district. Sixty-one of the former had been struck off.\r\n\r\nOn November 16th[2] warrants were issued for the arrest of\r\ntwenty-six insurgents, among them being Mr. Papineau, Doctor\r\nO’Callaghan, Mr. Thomas Storrow Brown and the accredited leaders\r\nof the “Fils de Liberté.” The principal leaders escaped, Mr.\r\nPapineau flying to Doctor Nelson at St. Denis.\r\n\r\nOn the same day Lieutenant Ermatinger with a party of eighteen of\r\nthe Montreal cavalry was sent to St. John’s to arrest three who\r\nhad been instrumental in forcing the resignation of government\r\nofficials. They were returning with the prisoners when they were\r\nsurprised at Longueuil by a rescue party of two or three hundred\r\nand after some heavy firing the assailants departed with the\r\nrescued prisoners. This victory organized by Mr. Bonaventure\r\nViger and others, gave courage to the insurrectionists and was\r\nthe commencement of hostilities. To counteract the dangers\r\narising from the éclat of the release, an address to the parishes\r\nwas issued and signed by thirteen French-Canadian magistrates of\r\nMontreal, D.B. Viger, Pierre de Rocheblave, Louis Guy, Edouard M.\r\nLeprohon, Etienne Guy, P.R. Leclerc, W.B. Donegani, Charles J.\r\nRodier, Alexis Laframbroise, Jules Quesnel, Felix Souligny, P.J.\r\nLaCroix, and N.G. Barron, counseling submission to law and order.\r\n“Those who urge you to these excesses,” it said, “are not your\r\ntrue friends. They have already abandoned you and will abandon\r\nyou in a moment of danger, whilst we, who recall you to the paths\r\nof peace, believe ourselves to be the most devoted servants of\r\nthe country.”\r\n\r\nThe insurrection feared was likely to be confined to the counties\r\nbordering on the Richelieu and to the county of Two Mountains\r\nnorth of Montreal. Consequently detachments of military were sent\r\nfrom Montreal to the disaffected districts, such as St. Denis\r\nand St. Charles. At St. Denis on November 23d Colonel Gore’s\r\ndetachment besieged Madame St. Germain’s storehouse, whither Dr.\r\nWolfred Nelson had retreated with a number of men and from which\r\nPapineau had already fled early in the day. Gore left behind him\r\nthirteen of the defenders killed, and of his own, six dead, five\r\nwounded, and a spiked howitzer. On the morning of November 23d\r\nthe tragedy of the death of Lieutenant Weir of the Thirty-second\r\nregiment took place. He had been sent with dispatches and was\r\ncaptured by Doctor Nelson’s patrol. He was given to a Captain\r\nJalibert to be taken in a wagon to St. Charles. On the way\r\nthither Weir attempted to escape. It was alleged that he was\r\nbrutally cut down. The autopsy disclosed many sword wounds and\r\npistol shots. His body was found in the Richelieu weighted down\r\nwith stones, lying on its face in two feet of water. On December\r\n8th it was buried with much solemnity. In 1839 Jalibert was tried\r\nfor murder but was acquitted.\r\n\r\nAt St. Charles the insurgents were under the leadership of\r\nThomas Storrow Brown who, from being in the iron retail trade in\r\nMontreal, now became “General” in the absence of the accredited\r\nleaders. He had lost an eye in the riot of November 6th and was\r\nlooked upon as a patriot. At St. Charles the curé, M. Blanchet,\r\nlent his support to the insurgents, one of the few examples\r\nof the clergy meddling in this trying time. The other was M.\r\nChartier of St. Eustache, who was afterward interdicted by Mgr.\r\nBourget for his conduct. The engagement at St. Charles took place\r\non November 24th. Of Colonel Wetherall’s detachment, the official\r\nreport gives one sergeant, two rank and file killed, eighteen\r\nwounded, ten seriously. It is difficult to chronicle the returns\r\nof the insurgents. One statement is that 152 of the insurgents\r\nwere killed and 300 wounded. The tradition in the village today\r\nis that forty-two were left on the field and a great many\r\nwounded. It is certain that thirty prisoners were received in\r\nMontreal.\r\n\r\nIn the north of Montreal the insurrection broke down after the\r\nnews of St. Charles, so that even at St. Eustache the opposition\r\noffered by Amery Girod and Doctor Chenier collapsed on December\r\n14th, though it is said not without the loss of seventy killed.\r\nThe loss of military is reported as one private killed, one\r\ncorporal and seven privates wounded. Sir John Colborne had been\r\nin charge of the column. This returned to Montreal on the 16th\r\nwith 106 prisoners from the insurrectionary district, including\r\nSt. Eustache. The Abbé Chartier escaped to the States; Amery\r\nGirod fled but on the fourth day of his flight he blew his brains\r\nout to avoid falling into the hands of the police. Doctor Chenier\r\nfell pierced with a ball as he was escaping from the window of\r\nthe parish church.\r\n\r\nOn the 29th of November a proclamation had been issued offering\r\n£500 for the apprehension, among others, of Dr. Wolfred Nelson,\r\nThomas Storrow Brown, Doctor O’Callaghan, Doctor Coté and\r\nDrolet of St. Marie. On December 1st a proclamation offered\r\n£1,000 for the arrest of Mr. Papineau. Mr. Papineau and his\r\nfaithful companion, Doctor O’Callaghan, had fled together from\r\nSt. Denis to St. Hyacinthe and after the news of the disaster\r\nat St. Charles they made for Swanston in Vermont. Afterwards\r\nhe spent some years in Paris. Doctor O’Callaghan never returned\r\nto Montreal, although permitted with Wolfred Nelson and Thomas\r\nStorrow Brown by the _nolle sequi_ of 1843, secured through\r\nMr. Hippolyte Lafontaine, attorney general under the Union. He\r\nbecame distinguished at New York as a peaceful translator and\r\neditor of the documentary history of New York. Dr. Wolfred Nelson\r\nescaped in the direction of the United States, but was captured\r\non December 12th, worn out with hunger and cold, and was taken\r\nback prisoner to Montreal. His courage and uprightness, however,\r\nentitled him to the respectful treatment he was there accorded.\r\nOn December 5th martial law was proclaimed and the banks conveyed\r\ntheir “specie” to the citadel. On January 8, 1838, Mgr. Lartigue\r\nissued a second mandement in which he blamed those who turned a\r\ndeaf ear to the clergy, who had warned them against the danger\r\nof listening to the “coryphèes d’une faction” with whom they had\r\nbecome infatuated.\r\n\r\nOn February 20th a day of thansgiving was held for the\r\ntermination of rebellion and the renewal of peace. This day\r\nalso marked the handing over of the administration of Lord\r\nGosford to Sir John Colborne, who entered on his authority on\r\nthe 27th. In the meantime, in London, it had been determined to\r\nsend Lord Durham as special commissioner. The act suspending\r\nthe constitution of Canada reached Canada in February and\r\nwas proclaimed on the 20th of March. A special council[3] of\r\nthe legislature was appointed and gazetted on April 5th with\r\na summons to meet on the 18th. This provisional council was\r\nafterwards dissolved by Lord Durham on his arrival.\r\n\r\nAbout the beginning of March an abortive attempt to arouse\r\ninsurgents was made under Robert Nelson, brother of Wolfred, and\r\nDoctor Coté, on the frontier, who were both arrested and handed\r\nto the civil power. Six hundred “patriots” surrendered on this\r\noccasion to General Wool of the United States army. At this time\r\na fatuous declaration of the independence of Canada appeared in\r\nthe Montreal papers signed by Robert Nelson, _president_, by\r\norder of the Provincial Government: the proclamation accompanying\r\nit was also signed by Nelson as Commander-in-Chief.\r\n\r\nAbout the end of April the Glengarry and Lancaster Regiments\r\nmarched through Montreal on their way home, their presence being\r\nno longer required, owing to the proclamation of the termination\r\nof martial law on April 27th.\r\n\r\nOn May 29th Lord Durham arrived with his large staff. One of his\r\nearly acts was to issue on the 28th of June an amnesty to all\r\nwho had engaged in the late insurrection on giving security for\r\ntheir good behaviour applicable to those in custody or who had\r\nfled. There was an exception made for eight who were to be\r\nsent without trial to the convict station of Bermuda. These were\r\nDr. Wolfred Nelson, R.S.M. Bouchette, Bonaventure Viger, Simeon\r\nMarchesseault, Godda, Dr. L.H. Masson, Gauvin, and Desirivières.\r\nDeath penalties were to be awarded to L.J. Papineau, Doctor\r\nO’Sullivan, Thomas S. Brown, John Brown (father and son), George\r\nEtienne Cartier and others if they should return of their own\r\naccord. This was afterward annulled. On the 7th of July, Durham\r\nleft Quebec for Montreal and the west. In Montreal he was well\r\nreceived. His stay in the country as a commissioner was, however,\r\nvery short. For on September 25th, as the Imperial government\r\ndisallowed these ordinances, Durham notified his resignation\r\nto the British government, remaining at his post till November\r\n1st, when he sailed for Quebec.[4] Sir John Colborne assumed the\r\nadministration on this day. On the 16th of January, 1839, he\r\nbecame governor general.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LORD DURHAM]\r\n\r\nThe second insurrection opened on November 4th, when Robert\r\nNelson entered Napierville to declare himself President of the\r\nRepublic of Canada. During the summer Nelson, Coté, Mailhot and\r\nothers of the refugees on the Vermont and New York frontiers had\r\nbeen organizing the insurrection among the _habitants_ of the\r\ncounties of the Richelieu extending west to Beauharnois. The\r\ndistrict of the Two Mountains did not rise this time.\r\n\r\nSir John Colborne was at Sorel when he heard of the Richelieu\r\ngatherings. Posting to Montreal he proclaimed martial law and by\r\nthe 7th and 8th of November the military was dispatched from the\r\ncity under Sir James Macdonell. The campaign was over by November\r\n10th, when the resistance at Beauharnois was suppressed. Yet but\r\nfor the decisive action of Colborne it might have been serious.\r\nSir John wrote that no fewer than thirteen thousand habitants\r\nhad assembled between the 3d and 8th of November expecting to be\r\nfurnished arms by their Vermont and New York sympathizers.\r\n\r\nIf the second insurrection was of less importance its reprisals\r\nwere more serious. The first rebellion had passed without the\r\njudicial shedding of any blood and with a generous amnesty. On\r\nthe second revolt it was thought necessary by Sir John Colborne\r\nto put the fear of the law into all further harbourers of\r\ntreason. A special court martial was constituted in Montreal, and\r\nmany suspects were imprisoned. In Montreal 679 had been arrested\r\nin December, and in January following 129 more. Sir Hippolyte\r\nLafontaine was one, but he was released on December 13th. Mr.\r\nD.B. Viger refused to give a security for his good conduct and\r\nhe was kept prisoner until he was specially and unconditionally\r\nreleased by Governor General Lord Sydenham. Those arrested\r\nelsewhere were few. Of those convicted and sentenced to death,\r\ntwenty-seven were pardoned on security of good behaviour. Four\r\nwere bound not to come within a stated distance of the frontier.\r\nOf the prisoners tried in Montreal, sixty-eight were embarked\r\nat Quebec on the transport “Buffalo” for New South Wales,\r\naccompanied by eighty-three from Upper Canada. Later, within five\r\nyears, they returned, pardoned, to the Province.\r\n\r\nIn September, 1839, the trial of Jalibert and others for\r\nthe murder of Lieutenant Weir took place, and the prisoners\r\nwere released. The grand jury found true bills against Louis\r\nJoseph Papineau, Thomas Storrow Brown, Robert Nelson and E.B.\r\nO’Callaghan. The political executions which took place in\r\nMontreal as the aftermath of the January insurrection were twelve\r\nin number. Six were convicted as murderers and five zealous\r\ninsurgents of 1838. The last was a foreign adventurer. The\r\nexecutions were as follows:\r\n\r\nFriday, December 21, 1839: Joseph Narcisse Cardinal, a notary\r\nand member of the Assembly for Beauharnois. Joseph Duquette, a\r\nyoung man who had followed his leader, Cardinal, in the attack of\r\nCaughnawaga.\r\n\r\nEighteenth of January, 1839: Pierre Theophile Decoigne, notary of\r\nNapierville, a leader in the insurrection of January, 1838, at\r\nNapierville. Joseph Jacques Robert, a farmer and leader. François\r\nXavier Hamelin, a lieutenant of Robert; Ambroise Sanguinet, a\r\ncaptain; Charles Sanguinet, his brother, a lieutenant; who all\r\nfour had been engaged in the murder, in 1838, of one, Walker,\r\nliving at La Tortue, seven miles from La Prairie.\r\n\r\nFifteenth of February, 1839: Pierre René Narbonne, a house\r\npainter, present at Napierville. Marie Thomas, Chevalier de\r\nLorimier, a lawyer, who had been prominent in the insurrection\r\nand had been engaged in the seizure of the “Lord Brougham”;\r\nFrançois Nicholas and Amable Daunais, both acquitted of murder of\r\nChartrand in 1837, but retaken on the occasion of their presence\r\nin the engagement of Odelltown, and Charles Hinderlang, taken at\r\nOdelltown, a foreign adventurer.\r\n\r\nOn the eve of their execution[5] the five last named were allowed\r\nto give a supper to their “compatriotes” imprisoned with them.\r\nIt was a sorry repast. The Chevalier de Lorimier is reported to\r\nhave said on this occasion: “Can my country ever forget that we\r\ndie for her upon the scaffold? We have lived as patriots--as\r\npatriots let us die. Down with the tyrants! Their reign is over!”\r\nNext day, as Hindelang was approaching the gallows, de Lorimier\r\ncalled to him: “Courage, mon ami! the end is near!” “Death is\r\nnothing to a Frenchman,” was the reply. On his arrival at the\r\nscaffold Hindelang addressed the crowd. “On this scaffold, raised\r\nby English hands, I declare that I die with the conviction of\r\nhaving done my duty. The sentence which condemns me is unjust,\r\nbut I willingly forgive my judges. The cause for which I die is\r\nnoble and great. I am proud of it and I fear not to die. The\r\nblood shed will be redeemed by blood. Let the blameworthy bear\r\nthe responsibility. Canadians! In bidding you adieu I bequeath to\r\nyou the device of France! ‘Vive liberté.’” Nicholas also made a\r\nshort address: “I have only one regret,” he said, “and that is,\r\nto die before seeing my country free, but Providence will end\r\nby having pity on it, for there is no country in the world more\r\nbadly governed.” The Chevalier de Lorimier was the last to suffer\r\nthe extreme penalty. When he was cut down, a brief letter was\r\nfound on his breast addressed to his wife and children. It ended,\r\n“Adieu, my tender wife, once more adieu! Live and be happy.\r\n(Signed) Your unhappy husband, Chevalier de Lorimier.”[6]\r\n\r\nAmong the prominent Montrealers arrested in 1838 and 1839 the\r\nfollowing names are found: Louis H. Lafontaine, Denis B. Viger,\r\nCharles Mondelet, François Desrivières, advocates; L.J. Harkins,\r\nD. Chopin, Aug. Racicot, George Dillon, Henry Badeau, Louis\r\nCoursolles, F. Pigeon, Cyrille David, François Blanchard, Louis\r\nMorin, William Brown, T. Willing, J.A. Labadie, J.B. Choquette,\r\nDerome P. de Boucherville, J. Donegani, M. de Marchand, Felix\r\nGoulet, Avila Weilbrenner, Richard Dillon, H. Hamelin, J.B.\r\nHoulée, A. Dupère, M. Bourbonnière, Samuel Newcombe, Pierre\r\nLussier, François Lauzon, Luc Dufresne, E.A. Dubois, Bouthillier,\r\nJohn Fullum, François Contant, François St. Marie, E. Hauschman,\r\nJ.E. Coderre, P. Coté, Jérémie Hippolyte, Jérémie Barrette,\r\nLeandre Ducharme, John McDonald, J. Berthelet, A. Perrault, E.R.\r\nFabre, G.J. Vallée, Jean Dubrec, A.B. Lesperance, Jean Leclaire,\r\nChevalier de Lorimier, François Cinq Mars, J.P.B. Belleville,\r\nS. Reeves, J.S. Ney Smith, Celestin Beausoleil, Louis Dubois,\r\nJérémie Longpré, etc.\r\n\r\nIt is a significant commentary on the sad troubles of 1837-8\r\nthat the names of several prominent British Montrealers are\r\nto be found as actively sympathizing with the insurgents.\r\nThe fact, too, that the “Vindicator,” conducted by Doctor\r\nO’Callaghan, could find sufficient English readers to support\r\nit, is another indication of a wider sympathy than usually\r\nrecognized. A man like Dr. Wolfred Nelson who had lived with\r\nthe French habitants at St. Denis, spoke their language and\r\nunderstood their grievances, a man of uprightness, sincerity\r\nand disinterestedness, would never have resisted authority and\r\nrisked his reputation and fortune unless the irksomeness of\r\nthe situation had become intolerable.[7] Writing from jail at\r\nMontreal on the 18th of June, 1838, to Lord Durham, he said on\r\nbehalf of his fellow prisoners: “We rebelled neither against\r\nHer Majesty’s person nor her government, but against colonial\r\nmisgovernment. * * * We remonstrated; we were derided. The press\r\nassailed us with calumny and contumely; invective was exhausted;\r\nwe were goaded on to madness and were compelled to show we had\r\nthe spirit of resistance to repel injuries or to be deemed a\r\ncaptive, degraded and recreant people. We took up arms not to\r\nattack others but to defend ourselves.”\r\n\r\nHis imprisonment and his loss of fortune effected his health,\r\nbut without repining he boldly played the game of life. In 1843\r\na “nolle sequi” allowed him to return to practice medicine in\r\nMontreal. He was shortly elected to the Assembly under the Union.\r\nHe became twice mayor of his native city. He was one of the first\r\nharbour commissioners and became the inspector of prisons. In\r\nsiding with the insurgents he was no hair-brained enthusiast or\r\nadventurer and he died without the stain of reproach--an honoured\r\ncitizen.\r\n\r\nIt has been felt necessary to delay long on this unpleasant part\r\nof civic history because it exemplifies the evil of different\r\nraces living together with mistrust and misunderstanding of one\r\nanother. If they would but strive to see each other’s viewpoints\r\nand would read each other’s history there would be an end of\r\nracial prejudices.\r\n\r\n“Tout savoir, c’est tout pardonner.” May the mutual\r\nmisunderstanding of 1837-8 never occur again. “Concordia Salus,”\r\nthe motto chosen by Jacques Viger, the first mayor of Montreal,\r\nfor the city arms, should never be forgotten.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[1] Mr. Debartzch, of St. Charles, a legislative councillor, had\r\ntill this date been a strenuous upholder of Mr. Papineau. The\r\nturn of events seemed to him to be unconstitutional and he became\r\nopposed to the new insurrectionary methods. He was now accounted\r\na traitor. He escaped to Montreal with his family.\r\n\r\n[2] On November 16th Mr. Turton Penn, one of the justices of\r\nthe peace, signed the order for the imprisonment of Charles A.\r\nLeblanc (afterwards sheriff), Jean Dubrec, Amable Simard, Georges\r\nde Boucherville, Andre Ouimet and François Tavernier accused of\r\nhigh treason on November 17th, Jean François Bossé Lionnais, and\r\non the 18th Louis Michel Viger (Beau Viger), the president of the\r\nrecently founded Banque du Peuple and father of D.B. Viger were\r\nimprisoned; on the 21st Michel Vincent, and on the 26th, Narcisse\r\nLamothe suffered the same fate.\r\n\r\n[3] The following constituted the first special council,\r\nDistrict of Quebec: The Honorable C.E.C. de Léry (Quebec); the\r\nHonorable James Stuart (Quebec); John Wilson, Esq., and William\r\nWalker, Esq. (Quebec); Amable Dionne, Esq. (Kamouraska); Charles\r\nCasgrain, Esq. (Rivière Oulle); the Honorable R.P. de Sales de la\r\nTerrière (Eboulements), District of Montreal: The Honorable T.\r\nPothier; P. McGill; P. de Rocheblave (Montreal); Samuel Gerrard,\r\nEsq.; Jules Quesnel, Esq.; W.P. Christie, Esq.; Turton Penn,\r\nEsq.; and John Molson, Esq. (Montreal); the Honorable J. Cuthbert\r\n(Berthier); the Honorable B. Joliette (St. Paul Lavaltrie);\r\nJoseph E. Fairbault, Esq. (L’Assomption); Paul H. Knowlton,\r\nEsq. (Brome); Icabod Smith, Esq. (Stanstead). District of Three\r\nRivers: Joseph Dionne, Esq. (St. Pierre les Becquets); Etienne\r\nMayrand, Esq. (Rivière du Loup).\r\n\r\n[4] Lord Durham did not live to see the eventual success of the\r\nUnion recommended by his famous report. Prematurely worn out, he\r\ndied at Cowes on the 28th of July, 1840.\r\n\r\n[5] See “Histoire Populaire de Montreal,” p. 357. LeBlond Brumath.\r\n\r\n[6] See “Histoire Populaire de Montreal,” p. 357. LeBlond Brumath.\r\n\r\n[7] Writing a reminiscence of Montreal from 1818 to 1868. Mr.\r\nThomas Storrow Brown has the following allusion to 1837-8:\r\n“Mixing much with these French Canadians, I became interested\r\nin the cause. I thought the stipulation of the capitulation had\r\nnot been fulfilled to a ceded people and when grown to manhood\r\na sense of justice, that generous inheritance from a British\r\nancestry, urged me to a knight errancy in their battle that\r\nterminated in the overthrow of my own fortunes and that after\r\nyears of hard struggle to regain a lost position, all for no\r\nthanks or even recognition of service.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                          CHAPTER XVIII\r\n\r\n                    PROCLAMATION OF THE UNION\r\n\r\n                              1841\r\n\r\n                    HOME RULE FOR THE COLONY\r\n\r\n  THE DURHAM REPORT--THE RESOLUTIONS AT THE CHATEAU DE\r\n    RAMEZAY--LORD SYDENHAM--THE PROCLAMATION OF UNION AT\r\n    MONTREAL--RESPONSIBLE GOVERNMENT AT LAST.\r\n\r\n\r\nDurham was wisely lenient with the political prisoners waiting\r\nfor trial at Montreal, but his injudicious step in securing\r\nconfessions, through an intermediary, from Doctor Nelson and\r\nhis companions--by inducing them to place themselves at his\r\ndiscretion, and then his condemnation of them without trial to\r\nbe transported to Bermuda, forbidding them to return under pain\r\nof high treason, and his extraordinary ordinance declaring that\r\nPapineau and the fifteen others who had escaped and had neither\r\nconfessed nor been found guilty should suffer death if they\r\nreturned to Lower Canada--was held in the English parliament,\r\non the initiative of his enemy, Lord Brougham, to be utterly\r\nsubversive of the principles of English colonial law. Accordingly\r\nhis ordinance was disallowed; hence his resignation and return\r\nto England. He died about eighteen months later, a broken man.\r\nBut he did much for Canada and his famous report stands out a\r\nmasterpiece of statesmanship. It is to the credit of Adam Thom,\r\nof Montreal, to have been associated in its compilation as\r\nDurham’s secretary for the purpose.\r\n\r\nThis report of Durham has had far reaching effect. It was\r\nbased on a study of the situation. He found an acute political\r\nassociation as follows:\r\n\r\nThe Assembly complained that the constitutional government\r\ngiven them in 1791 was a mockery. They could elect members but\r\nmembers who had no control, who might fret and fume and froth\r\nbut could not appoint a single crown servant. In name it was a\r\nrepresentative body, French, Catholic and popularly elected.\r\nThe legislative council was all powerful, its members nominated\r\nby the government, and holding their offices permanently, but\r\nBritish, Protestant and exclusive, and above all the clatter\r\nwas the Executive Council and the governor, who were dependent\r\nhand and foot on Downing Street officialdom and from it received\r\ninstructions, so that the few ruled the many, independently of\r\nthe council’s representation of the latter. Thus a race war had\r\ndeveloped, the majority, French, savagely demanding their rights\r\nof popular representation and the minority, British, desirous of\r\nkeeping the upper hand. Thus the French Assembly developed into\r\na permanent opposition to everything British till it flamed out\r\ninto recourse to arms when British and French paired off into\r\ndistinct camps.\r\n\r\n“I expected,” says Durham in his report, “to find a contest\r\nbetween a government and a people. I found two nations warring\r\nin the bosom of a single state. I found a struggle not of\r\nprinciples but of races.” Hence his grand solution was “home\r\nrule” for the colony and the abolition of the Downing Street\r\nrestrictive régime of red tape. He was accused by the British of\r\ndeserting his own side; he pleased the French-Canadians by this\r\nabove recommendation but bitterly disappointed them by making\r\nresponsible government dependent on the Union of the Canadas,\r\nfor it was feared by this Union with Protestant Ontario their\r\nnational existence was jeopardized. But this was precisely what\r\nDurham wanted, trusting in the inevitable growth of immigration:\r\n“I have little doubt,” he says, “that the French, when once\r\nplaced in a majority by the legitimate course of events and the\r\nworking of natural causes in a minority, would abandon their vain\r\nhopes of nationality.”\r\n\r\nDurham looked forward to the time when British North America\r\nshould have one parliament only. Thus he foresaw confederation.\r\n\r\nLord Durham’s masterly and statesmanlike report was presented\r\nto the Imperial parliament on January 31, 1839. It advocated\r\nthe repeal of the Constitutional Act of 1791, which divided the\r\ntwo provinces and so created two distinct nationalities, and\r\nit recommended the legislative Union of the Canadas. The bill\r\nproposed for this effect by Lord John Russell was postponed\r\ntill next year. Another bill, however, passed to continue the\r\nlegislative council in their especial powers till 1842. Canada\r\nwas still, therefore, without a constitution.\r\n\r\nThe new governor general to succeed Sir John Colborne, who had\r\nbeen invested with the Grand Cross of the Bath for his services,\r\narrived at Quebec on October 17th. He was Mr. Charles Poulett\r\nThomson, who had been president of the Board of Trade in England.\r\nHe entered on his office on October 19th. He left for Montreal in\r\nOctober to meet the legislative council, now established there.\r\n\r\nThe news of the proposed union was grateful, especially at\r\nMontreal, to the British merchant class, who foresaw commercial\r\nexpansion and progress. At Quebec there was some dissension,\r\nsince the meeting place of the projected union parliament was\r\nlikely to be at Montreal, and thus Quebec would lose its ancient\r\nprestige. The measure was not as yet looked on with full favour\r\nby the French-Canadians in general, as it seemed to them to be\r\na scheme to weaken the influence of their political life and to\r\nbe destructive of their national aspirations. On the 11th of\r\nNovember the legislative council of Lower Canada met and on the\r\n16th six resolutions were passed at the Château de Ramezay.\r\n\r\nFirst: The Union was affirmed to be an indispensable and urgent\r\nnecessity. Second: that the determination to reunite the\r\nProvinces received ready acquiescence. Third: that suitable\r\ncivil lists should be provided securing the independence of the\r\njudges and maintaining the executive in its functions. Fourth:\r\nthat the proportion of debt of Upper Canada contracted for the\r\nimprovement of internal communication should be charged to the\r\nrevenue of both provinces; the outlay for defraying expenses of\r\na local character not to be included. Fifth: that the adjustment\r\nand settlement of the terms of Union should be submitted to the\r\nwisdom and justice of the Imperial parliament. Sixth: that a\r\npermanent legislature composed of the people of both Provinces\r\nshould be convened as soon as possible.\r\n\r\nThe resolutions were carried with three dissenters, Messrs.\r\nCuthbert (Berthier), Neilson (Quebec) and Quesnel (Montreal),\r\nthe members of the council supporting the union being Chief\r\nJustice Stuart, Pothier, de Léry and Walker (Quebec), McGill,\r\nde Rocheblave, Gerrard, Christie, Molson, Moffatt (Montreal),\r\nHarwood and Hale (Sherbrooke).\r\n\r\nThe majority of the legislative assembly being ready for the\r\nunion of the provinces, which was an equivalent to yielding\r\nto responsible government power they had held so long and\r\narbitrarily, must be noted as significant of the trend of\r\nopinion. Some ordinances were passed: first, continuing until\r\nJune, 1840, the power to retain arms and gunpowder; second,\r\ncontinuing the ordinance relating to persons charged with high\r\ntreason; third, incorporating the Ecclesiastics of Montreal in\r\nthe fief and seignories of St. Sulpice and of Two Mountains--the\r\nconclusion of many years’ negotiations.\r\n\r\nOn November 18th Mr. Paulett Thomson wrote from Montreal to\r\nLord John Russell to urge the speedy adoption of the Union by\r\nparliament. He wrote: “All parties look with extreme satisfaction\r\non the present state of government. * * * The suspension of\r\nall constitutional rights affords to reckless and unprincipled\r\nagitators a constant topic of excitement. * * * All parties,\r\ntherefore, without an exception, demand a change. On the nature\r\nof that change there undoubtedly exists some difference of\r\nopinion. The large majority, however, of those whose opinions I\r\nhave had the opportunity of learning, both of British and French\r\norigin, and of those, too, whose character and station enable\r\nthem to the greatest authority, advocate warmly the establishment\r\nof the union and that upon terms of perfect fairness, not merely\r\nto the two provinces but to the two races within the provinces.”\r\nMr. Thomson then left for the Upper Province, arriving at Toronto\r\non November 21st.\r\n\r\nThe union bill of Lord John Russell received the royal sanction\r\non July 23, 1840, but it did not take effect till February 10,\r\n1841. On this day the union was solemnly established at Montreal.\r\nMr. Paulett Thomson now became Lord Sydenham of York and Toronto\r\nin recognition of his part in the union. He took the oath of\r\noffice as governor-general in 1840.\r\n\r\nFebruary 10, 1841, Lord Sydenham issued a proclamation uniting\r\nUpper and Lower Canada into the province of Canada.\r\n\r\n“The choice of this date,” says Kingsford, “was because it was\r\non this day that the Imperial parliament assented to the act\r\nwhich had suspended the constitution of Lower Canada three years\r\npreviously, and it was thought an act of wisdom to re-establish\r\non the anniversary of this extreme measure constitutional\r\nliberty, which effectively terminated it. It was also the date of\r\nthe conclusion of the treaty of 1763, which ceded Canada to the\r\nBritish crown, and it was likewise the marriage day of the Queen.\r\n\r\n“On that day, in Montreal, in the presence of all the dignitaries\r\nof the church and of civil life, of the commander of the forces,\r\nof officers commanding regiments, and all who could be collected\r\nof the principal citizens, the oath was taken and the two\r\nprovinces were established as the province of Canada.\r\n\r\n“Lord Sydenham issued a proclamation on this occasion, in which\r\nhe urged the inhabitants to be united in sentiment as in name\r\nand reminded them that they were ‘a part of the mighty empire\r\nof England, protected by her arms, assisted by her treasury,\r\nadmitted to all the benefits of trade as her citizens, their\r\nfreedom guaranteed by her laws, and their rights supported by the\r\nsympathy of their fellow-subjects there.’”\r\n\r\nLord Sydenham lived to call the first session of the United\r\nProvince, which met at Kingston on June 14th, when Mr. Cuvillier\r\nwas elected speaker, and on July 15th His Excellency gave the\r\nspeech from the throne, but he was a sick man and he never lived\r\nto the close of the session. The prorogation of the legislature\r\nhad been appointed for September 15th. It was deferred till\r\nSeptember 17th to allow him to be present, since on September\r\n4th he had met an accident horse-riding (taken for his health)\r\nin the neighbourhood of Kingston. He died on September 19th.\r\n“The Success of the Union,” as Kingsford[1] remarks, in the last\r\nchapter of his “History of Canada,” “is Lord Sydenham’s epitaph.”\r\n\r\nResponsible government was at last attained. The union so\r\nardently denied by the British party and needlessly feared by the\r\nother was to bring progress and prosperity to both. The Union was\r\nnot a perfect measure, but it redressed many grievances and made\r\nfor a more united people.\r\n\r\n“The act provided for a legislative council of not less than\r\ntwenty members for a legislative assembly in which each section\r\nof the united province would be represented by an equal number\r\nof members--that is to say, forty-two for each, or eighty-four\r\nin all. The speaker of the council was appointed by the crown\r\nand ten members, including the speaker, constituted a quorum. A\r\nmajority of voices was to decide and in case of an equality of\r\nvotes the speaker had a casting vote. A legislative counsellor\r\nwould vacate his seat by continuous absence from two consecutive\r\nsessions. The number of representatives allotted to each province\r\ncould not be changed except with the concurrence of two-thirds\r\nof the members of each house. The quorum of the assembly was\r\nto be twenty, including the speaker. The speaker was elected\r\nby the majority and was to have a casting vote in case of the\r\nvotes being equal on a question. No person could be elected\r\nto the assembly unless he possessed a free-hold of land and\r\ntenements to the value of £500 sterling over and above all debts\r\nand mortgages. The English language alone was to be used in\r\nlegislative records. A session of the legislature should be held\r\nat least every year and each legislative assembly was to have\r\na duration of four years unless sooner divided.” (Bourinot’s\r\n“Constitution of Canada,” page 35.)\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[1] Mr. Kingsford published, after twelve years of labour the\r\nlast of his ten volumes of the “History of Canada,” in 1898.\r\nThe preface was signed “Ottawa, 24th of May, 1898.” He died on\r\nSeptember 29, 1898. His work is that of a conscientious historian\r\nand the facts he has marshalled together are invaluable to\r\nstudents.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                           CHAPTER XIX\r\n\r\n             RESPONSIBLE GOVERNMENT UNDER THE UNION\r\n\r\n  KINGSTON THE SEAT OF GOVERNMENT--THE RACE CRY\r\n    RESUSCITATED--LAFONTAINE--RESPONSIBLE GOVERNMENT--MONTREAL\r\n    ELECTIONS--RESTRICTION REMOVED ON FRENCH LANGUAGE IN\r\n    PARLIAMENT--FREE TRADE MOVEMENT--FINANCIAL DEPRESSION--GEORGE\r\n    ETIENNE CARTIER--REBELLION LOSSES BILL--THE BURNING OF THE\r\n    PARLIAMENT HOUSE--THE MONTREAL MOVEMENT FOR ANNEXATION\r\n    WITH THE STATES--“CLEAR GRITS” AND THE “PARTI ROUGE”--THE\r\n    RAILWAY AND SHIPPING ERA--THE GAVAZZI RIOT--THE RECIPROCITY\r\n    TREATY--EXIT THE OLD TORYISM--CLERGY RESERVES AND SEIGNEURIAL\r\n    TENURE ACTS--THE MILITIA ACT--MONTREALERS ON THE ELECTED\r\n    COUNCIL--THE _Année Terribe_ OF 1857--THOMAS D’ARCY MC\r\n    GEE--QUEBEC TEMPORARY SEAT OF GOVERNMENT--PROTECTION FOR HOME\r\n    INDUSTRIES--CONFEDERATION BROACHED IN MONTREAL--THE TRENT\r\n    AFFAIR--ST.

This was\r\nnaturally regarded jealously by Montreal and Quebec. The Montreal\r\nelections resulted in the sending thither of Mr. Benjamin Holmes\r\nand the Hon. George Moffatt to represent the city at the first\r\nsession, which opened for the dispatch of business on the 14th\r\nof June, 1841. Mr. D.B. Viger was elected for the Richelieu\r\ndistrict. Another well known at Montreal, one who had there\r\nconducted the “Minerve,” Mr. Augustus Norbert Morin, sat for\r\nNicolet.\r\n\r\nThe language of the house was English. This, together with the\r\nabsence of any French name from the new cabinet ministry was a\r\nnatural grievance which was seized upon by a part of the French\r\npress and race hatred seemed in danger of being renewed. The\r\nfollowing extract from a British Montreal paper of the day\r\nadverts to this:\r\n\r\n   “It is but a few weeks since the olive branch has been frankly\r\n  and honorably extended, since several English journals earnestly\r\n  advocated an oblivion of the past and a reconciliation of the\r\n  future. We must own that, however much we respect the attempt,\r\n  we never anticipated that it would be successful, and we daily\r\n  find in the pages of the Canadien, the French Gazette, the Aurora\r\n  and the other small fry, the proof of our prognostication. It\r\n  is the truth, a truth boldly and continually proclaimed by the\r\n  above mentioned public journals printed in the French language,\r\n  that the Canadian leaders and all who aspire to lead this\r\n  class of the population, now, as heretofore, must base their\r\n  only pretentions to popular support on their utter and entire\r\n  abhorrence of everything that is English. The word ‘anti-British’\r\n  is the type of their political existence, the only true passports\r\n  to the affections of a French constituency. They hate us not\r\n  because we are unionists or anti-unionists, whigs, tories,\r\n  radicals or conservatives, but because we are British. They hate\r\n  us not because we are Catholics, Protestants, Presbyterians or\r\n  Methodists, but because we are British. They hate us because\r\n  we speak English, because we love English laws, because we\r\n  admire English constitutions, because we would introduce English\r\n  improvements, because we have given them two or three good\r\n  English drubbings and are ready to give them again if provoked.\r\n  First they hate the Briton, secondly the American and lastly\r\n  their seigneurs and clergy are included in the same category, and\r\n  if they could only accomplish what they never will, get rid of\r\n  the Briton, they would be rapidly ‘used up’ by the Americans, who\r\n  would rob their seigneurs, discard their priests and improve the\r\n  ‘nation Canadienne’ off the face of the earth.”\r\n\r\nIt is pleasing to find that our newspapers of today do not\r\nreflect a like jarring exchange of bitterness. Montreal has\r\nlearned that its “salvation lies in harmony,” according to the\r\ncity’s motto, “Concordia Salus.”\r\n\r\nThe session passed without any hitch. The Union act had stood\r\nits test. The advent of Sir Charles Bagot as governor-general\r\nwith his policy of reconciliation saw M. Joseph Remi Vallières\r\nappointed chief justice of the district of Montreal and Dr.\r\nJean Baptiste Meilleur the superintendent of public instruction\r\nfor Lower Canada. When parliament met on September 8, 1842,\r\nMontreal looked with interest for the development likely to\r\nfollow on the entrance into the House of Mr. Louis Hippolyte\r\nLafontaine, an able lawyer who had practiced at Montreal and\r\nwho was known to be a born leader of men and to have succeeded\r\nto the position of M. Papineau in popular estimation. His short\r\nimprisonment as a rebel in 1838 added to his prestige. He was an\r\nold parliamentarian, having been in 1830, when only twenty-three\r\nyears of age, elected to the assembly of Lower Canada. On October\r\n12th the reconstructed government[1] saw the Hon. L.H. Lafontaine\r\nas attorney-general for Lower Canada (his friend, the Hon. Robert\r\nBaldwin, held the same office for Upper Canada) and the Hon. A.N.\r\nMorin, commissioner of crown lands. These appointments made the\r\nUnion more palatable to French-Canadians and it began to appear\r\nthat out of evil good was to come.\r\n\r\nDuring the next session of 1843 question of the future location\r\nof the parliament was settled by the choice of Montreal, on the\r\nmotion of Mr. Baldwin, seconded by Mr. Lafontaine.\r\n\r\nThe full signification of the term “Responsible Government” now\r\nbegan to be tested. The new governor, Sir Charles Metcalfe, who\r\nhad been sworn in on March 29, 1843, had come from Bengal with\r\nIndian ideas of dictatorship and he acted now independently of\r\nhis ministers, making appointments without consultation with\r\nthem, so that nine out of ten of the ministers resigned on\r\nNovember 26th on the ground that by the system of responsible\r\ngovernment adopted in the resolutions of the house in September,\r\n1841, to carry on a government the ministry must not only have\r\nthe confidence of the house and through it of the people, but\r\nalso of the head of the government. For nine months, therefore,\r\nthe country was without a ministry, Sir Charles Metcalfe being\r\nunable to construct one.\r\n\r\nAt this point Mr. D.B. Viger came into prominence as a supporter of\r\nthe governor and it was his efforts to win over the French-Canadians.\r\nAccordingly he visited Montreal and Lower Canada to be followed\r\nby Mr. Draper, but Lafontaine’s hold was too great. The hold-up\r\nof government created much anxiety, and trade and industry were\r\naffected. After great efforts a partial ministry was formed, the\r\npost of attorney-general for Lower Canada being accepted by Mr.\r\nJames Smith, of Montreal, Mr. Denis Benjamin Papineau, a brother\r\nof Louis Joseph, becoming commissioner of lands. Other offices\r\nwere filled but the completion of the names was left until after\r\nthe election.\r\n\r\nThese were held over the country mid scenes of riot and even\r\nbloodshed. At no place was the party strife more keenly shown\r\nthan at Montreal. By an election scheme it is said, to the\r\nsurprise of the opposition who ought to have commanded a\r\nmajority, the Hon. George Moffatt and Charles Clement Sabrevois\r\nde Bleury, supporters of the newly formed ministry, were elected\r\nagainst Mr. Lewis Thomas Drummond, a lawyer of Irish Catholic\r\norigin, afterwards a well known judge, and Doctor Beaubien. Mr.\r\nDrummond was returned, however, for Port Neuf. Among the new\r\nmembers of other constituencies Dr. Wolfred Nelson was returned\r\nfor Richelieu against D.B. Viger, the president of the new\r\ncouncil, who found a seat, however, elsewhere. John Alexander\r\nMacdonald was returned for Kingston as a supporter of the\r\ngovernment. The new government entered into power with a small\r\nmajority. Early in 1844 the government moved from Kingston to\r\nMontreal and Monklands became the home of the governor-general.\r\nOn July 1st the Parliament met in Montreal, being dissolved on\r\nSeptember 23d.\r\n\r\nOn November 12th the general elections began, the like of which\r\nhad never been seen in Canada. The voting in these times was\r\nopen, lasting for days. Citizens were keen politicians; axe\r\nhandles were in readiness; heads were broken and the “claret”\r\nflowed. Party spirit ran high and men were kept drunk in the\r\ntaverns so as not to allow them to reach the polls. In this\r\nelection at Montreal, Drummond was opposed to Molson, who was\r\nbeaten. On November 28th parliament met and was prorogued on\r\nMarch 29th of the following year.\r\n\r\nThe removal of the restrictions on the French language in\r\nparliament took place on January 31, 1845. Mr. Lafontaine had\r\ndesired to make the motion, but his plan, having become known to\r\nthe new government, desirous of furthering a popular move, he was\r\nanticipated by Mr. D.B. Papineau, seconded by the Hon. George\r\nMoffatt of Montreal.\r\n\r\nIn 1846 the merchants of Montreal held meetings to protest\r\nagainst the Free Trade movement, then being promoted in England\r\nby Cobden. On January 30, 1847, Lord Elgin, the successor of\r\nSir Charles Metcalfe, proceeded from Monklands, the home of the\r\ngovernor-general of Montreal, to be sworn in at Government House.\r\nOn May 31st Mr. Peter McGill became speaker of the legislative\r\ncouncil, with a seat in the cabinet of the reconstructed cabinet,\r\nknown as the Sherwood-Daly ministry. Mr. D.B. Papineau was the\r\nonly French-Canadian in it. Parliamentary life this year was\r\naffected by the evils of the “ship fever” brought over by the\r\nIrish emigrants who had made their exodus after the failure of\r\nthe potato crop. The opposition made political capital out of the\r\nevent by making the government responsible for the emigration\r\nlaws of the country.\r\n\r\nOn Friday, the 25th of February, 1848, the new parliament was\r\nheld at Montreal. Messrs. L.H. Lafontaine and Benjamin Holmes\r\nwere returned for the city. On the occasion Mr. L.J. Papineau,\r\nwho had been in pleasant exile so long in Paris, although he\r\ncould have returned in 1843, found himself elected in the Union\r\nparliament. He was little changed, but his star had waned, while\r\nthat of Lafontaine was in the ascendant. On March 10th Mr.\r\nLafontaine accepted office as Premier and attorney-general and\r\nwith his friend Baldwin formed the Lafontaine-Baldwin ministry.\r\nDuring this year the Canadian merchants suffered great commercial\r\ndepression, owing to the working out of the free trade act of\r\n1846. “Three-fourths of the merchants were bankrupt and real\r\nestate was practically unmarketable.”\r\n\r\nThe session of 1849 saw the advent into political life of George\r\nEtienne Cartier, the erstwhile rebel. He was born in Verchères\r\ncounty, at St. Antoine, but was educated at the college of St.\r\nSulpice at Montreal. His early law studies were in the office of\r\nM. Edouard Rodier and he was called to the bar and began practice\r\nin Montreal in 1835. He came early under the magnetic influence\r\nof Mr. Papineau and we find him a member of the “Fils de Liberté”\r\nand engaged in the fight under Doctor Nelson at St. Denis, thence\r\nflying as a proscribed man to the States. He quietly returned\r\nlater, when the embargo was raised, and settled down again to\r\npractice law at Montreal, but still keeping his attention on\r\npolitics.\r\n\r\nAn important bill came up this session entitled “an act to\r\nprovide for the indemnification of parties in Lower Canada whose\r\nproperty was destroyed during the rebellion in the years 1837 and\r\n1838.” It was called the Rebellion Losses Bill. It would seem\r\nrather belatedly brought in but it had been promised in some\r\nform during the past ten years as a means of indemnifying those\r\nwho had suffered from the very great destruction of property\r\nduring that agitated period. In 1845 the rebellion losses\r\ncommittee first sat. On April 18th the commissioners reported\r\nthat they recognized 2,276 claims, amounting in the aggregate\r\nto £241,965, and were of the opinion that £100,000 would be\r\nsufficient to pay all real losses. On January 18, 1849, Mr.\r\nLafontaine moved the belated bill. It made provision for the\r\nappointment of five commissioners to carry out the act and a sum\r\nof £100,000 was appropriated to pay the claims. Those, however,\r\nwho had been convicted of treason during the rebellion and who\r\nhad been sent to Bermuda, were excepted from claiming any share\r\nin the grant. This, it will be seen, allowed “rebels” who had\r\nnot been convicted, an equal right to compensation with the\r\n“loyalists.” Consequently a storm broke out in parliament and\r\nin the country, but especially in Montreal. Various pamphlets\r\nappeared in Montreal at this time, indicating opposition, such\r\nas that entitled “The Question Answered; Did the Ministry intend\r\nto pay Rebels? Montreal, 1849,” supposed to have been written by\r\nthe Hon. Alexander Morris, then a law student, and a young tory\r\njournalist, Hugh E. Montgomerie. Yet the government was right in\r\ntheir inclusion of “rebels” for it would have been very unwise at\r\nthat period to reopen the question as to who had been rebels and\r\nwho had not. Besides the amnesty granted long since had plastered\r\nover all differences.\r\n\r\nYet, within and without Parliament the opposition was loud,\r\nfierce and tumultuous. The bill, however, passed the third\r\nreading in both houses. For some time previously petitions\r\nfrom the tories of the opposition body had been pouring in to\r\nLord Elgin, praying that the bill should either be reserved\r\nfor Imperial sanction, or that parliament should be dissolved.\r\nLord Elgin, who personally did not approve of the diversion\r\nof so much public money from more useful objects, feeling,\r\nhowever, that while no imperial interests were at stake, that the\r\nprinciple of responsible government was assented to the bill when\r\nit had passed both houses. This he did on Wednesday afternoon,\r\nthe 25th of April, 1849. On this occasion the galleries of the\r\nhouse were packed with “loyalist” opponents to the bill, and a\r\ntumult immediately arose which was continued as the crowd went\r\nout down the stairs to await Lord Elgin’s departure. When the\r\ngovernor-general, having finished his business, reached the front\r\ndoor, a hostile crowd had gathered and the fury of the opponents\r\nto the bill visited itself on him in oppobrious epithets. Groans,\r\nhisses, mud and addled eggs brought for the purpose were hurled\r\nat him. Some say also stones were added and in the midst of this\r\nhostile demonstration he drove off to Monklands, surrounded by\r\nthe military, by a long detour east and round the mountain to his\r\nhome. Three days afterwards at a special meeting of the Scotch\r\nNational Association, the “St. Andrew’s Society,” a resolution\r\nwas passed, erasing his name as a patron and an honorary member\r\nof that body.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: AUGUSTIN-NORBERT MORIN]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GEORGE ETIENNE CARTIER]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ROBERT BALDWIN]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LOUIS-JOSEPH PAPINEAU]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SIR LOUIS-HIPPOLYTE LAFONTAINE]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A.A. DORION]\r\n\r\nThat night about 8 o’clock the parliament buildings were\r\nburned by an angry mob. It was not unpremeditated, for the day\r\npreviously even some of the soldiers were warned to shut their\r\neyes next day if anything happened, and many did. After the\r\nsigning of the bill a meeting was held on Champ de Mars as the\r\nresult of printed notices, at which inflammatory speeches were\r\nmade. One of the leaders was a Fred Perry, who lived to be sorry\r\nfor his deed. “We are not in ’37,” he cried. “If you are men\r\nfollow me to the parliament house!” and he drove in a buggy,\r\nsurrounded by a sympathetic crowd, some carrying lighted torches\r\nand crying, “To the parliament house.” The parliament building\r\nwhich had been built as St. Ann’s market and leased to the\r\ngovernment, was a two-story building, the bottom floor of which\r\nwas remodeled to contain the government offices, while upstairs,\r\nat the head of a broad staircase, leading off a wide passage,\r\nwere two halls, one that of the legislative assembly, a room 342\r\nby 50 feet, and the other of the legislative council. Meanwhile\r\nthe house of assembly was discussing the judicature bill, and\r\nit was warned by the noise of the advancing mob. When the crowd\r\nreached the building, at a given signal stones crashed through\r\nthe windows like hail. A rush was made by some of the crowd into\r\nthe assembly hall from which the members had retreated. One of\r\nthe mob named Courtney sat boldly in the Speaker’s chair and\r\nmuttered threats about dissolving the parliament. The work of\r\ndemolition was begun, sticks being thrown at the glass globes on\r\nthe gaseliers that were out of reach. Then there was raised the\r\ncry of “fire!” The gas pipes in the building had been cut and\r\na light applied. An explosion followed and a blinding sheet of\r\nflame lit up the scene. Then ensued a mad rush of the members\r\nand their friends and enemies to get out of the building. The\r\nmob made no attempt to save it. The fire engines were only used\r\nupon the surrounding property and an eye witness relates that\r\nthe soldiers who were ordered to fire on the mob discharged\r\ntheir shots in the air. In half an hour the whole building was\r\nwrapped in one sheet of flame. The valuable library containing\r\nthe archives and records of the colony was destroyed. In the\r\nbeginning of the incendiarism lighted torches thrown through the\r\nwindow began the sad work of destruction. Little was saved but\r\nthe mace and the picture of Queen Victoria with the gilt crown\r\nsurmounting it. A newspaper account of two days later stated\r\nin effect “that the Queen’s picture was carried away by four\r\nscoundrels.” These have lately been identified as Colonel Wiley,\r\nformerly chief of police, a Scotchman of the name of McGillivray,\r\nfrom the eastern townships, an employee of the parliament, the\r\nuncle of Mr. Todd, of the Library of Parliament, and Mr. Sanford\r\nFleming (afterwards Sir).\r\n\r\nThe latter in reply to the historian, Henry J. Morgan, wrote in\r\n1901:\r\n\r\n“Having spent a number of days previously in examining rare\r\nbooks, I felt I should try to save some of them. I gained an\r\nentrance but the fire had taken possession of the library and\r\nI could do nothing. Turning to the legislative hall I saw the\r\nQueen’s picture. With three other men (then) unknown to me I\r\nmade an effort to save it, but it was no easy matter. It was in\r\na massive gilt frame, firmly bolted to the wall. We at last put\r\nour shoulders underneath and raised the whole, little by little,\r\nallowing it to fall down each time. This was repeated many times\r\ntill at last the fastenings gave way and all came down. We laid\r\nit on its face and, not being able to carry very easily the heavy\r\nframe, removed the canvas on its stretching frame and the four of\r\nus carried it out in a horizontal position, a shoulder under each\r\ncorner. With difficulty we got it downstairs on account of the\r\nflames passing overhead, but each stooped and covered the picture\r\nto prevent it getting scorched and thus got it to the open door.\r\nHaving done so, I left it to be taken to a place of safety by\r\nothers, some of whom were connected with the House. I thought\r\nI would return to the chamber to try to save something else,\r\nbut I saw nothing of much value which I could myself remove. I\r\ndid, however, carry out the gilded crown which had been over the\r\npicture, carrying it to Mack’s Hotel, where I was stopping, and\r\nafterwards took it with me in a tea chest to Toronto, where it\r\nremained in my possession for some years. What afterwards became\r\nof it I am not aware.” The picture of Queen Victoria is in the\r\nHouse of Commons at Ottawa.\r\n\r\nThe most unpopular man of the hour after Lord Elgin was Mr. L.H.\r\nLafontaine, who was in charge of the bill. His stables were burnt\r\nand his house ransacked. There were no proceedings taken against\r\nthe rioters and incendiarists, this being an evident sign that\r\nmany of those in power secretly sympathized with the movement.\r\nThe house of Mr. Hays, on Dalhousie Square, was leased for a\r\ntemporary parliament house, but shortly afterwards government\r\nmoved to Toronto and Montreal lost its position as the political\r\ncapital of Canada.\r\n\r\nIn August, 1849, the British American League was formed in\r\nMontreal with branches at Toronton, Kingston and elsewhere\r\nin Upper Canada. It had various aims--the chief planks being\r\nopposition to the existing government, a return to a protective\r\npolicy, the election of members of the legislative council, and\r\nmost important of all, a general union of the British North\r\nAmerican provinces. A meeting was held in Kingston towards the\r\nend of July. Among the chief speakers were George Moffatt and\r\nHugh E. Montgomerie, of Montreal, John A. Macdonald, of Kingston,\r\nalso spoke. The League did not hold together, but the extreme\r\nparty soon banded together and in consequence during the month\r\nof October a manifesto “to the people of Canada,” advocating the\r\nannexation of Canada to the United States, appeared in Montreal,\r\nsigned by many leading citizens, including the Torrances,\r\nthe Redpaths, the Molsons, the Workmans, the Dorions, Luther\r\nHamilton Holton, Benjamin Holmes, David Lewis Macpherson,\r\nJacob de Witt, Edward Goff Penny, D. Lorn Macdougall and John\r\nRoss--325 signatures in all. L.J. Papineau threw in his weight\r\nto the movement. Among the subscribers to the manifesto were\r\njustices of the peace, officers of the militia, Queen’s counsels\r\nand others holding commissions at the pleasure of the crown.\r\nMen of different political parties forgot their differences\r\nto promote the scheme. The ebullition was the outcome of the\r\ncommercial depression and unpromising outlook then prevailing.\r\nThe manifesto, after pointing out the deplorable state of the\r\ncountry, proceeded to suggest the remedies: the revival of\r\nprotection in the markets of the United Kingdom; the protection\r\nof home manufactures; a federal union of the British American\r\ncolonies as a federal republic and reciprocal free trade with\r\nthe United States. But the most sweeping remedy of all was the\r\nlast one suggested, namely, a “friendly and peaceful separation\r\nfrom British connection; a union upon equitable terms with the\r\ngreat North American Confederacy of Sovereign States,” in brief,\r\n_annexation_.[2] The movement was known in England and the\r\nMorning Advertiser of London of the period said in comment that\r\nEngland would be no loser were the Canadas to carry their threat\r\nof annexation into effect; indeed, England would gain.\r\n\r\n“The result,” it says, “of careful examination of the Canadian\r\nconnection in all its aspects, is, that so far from England being\r\na sufferer from the renunciation of their allegiance to the\r\nBritish Crown on the part of the Canadas, she would be an actual\r\ngainer. It is a well ascertained fact that the expenses of the\r\nconnection have more than counterbalanced its advantages. The\r\nmaintenance of that part of our colonial possessions subjects\r\nus to a yearly expenditure of £800,000 hard cash. Will any one\r\ntell us that the Canadas confer on us benefits at all equivalent\r\nto this? It may, indeed, be debated whether our exports to the\r\nCanadas would not be as great as they have been at any former\r\nperiod. At any rate we speak advisedly when we say that this\r\ncountry would be no loser by the secession of the Canadas. That\r\nis certainly the conclusion at which ministers have arrived after\r\nthe most able and careful consideration. On that conclusion they\r\nhave determined to act. When the session meets we shall see the\r\nfact brought fully before the public, with the ground on which\r\nthe cabinet has come to the conclusion at which it arrived.”\r\n\r\nSuch a statement, from a responsible English journal, sounds\r\nstrangely to us even today--but it is of value in reminding us\r\nthat at that time Britain was spending some four millions of\r\ndollars annually on the Canadas. Four years later, in 1854, the\r\nannexation movement received its quietus at the hands of Lord\r\nElgin, when he secured the passage of the Reciprocity Treaty.\r\n\r\nAs there was no very general support in Canada, the movement\r\nsoon collapsed. It was begotten of temporary gloom and despair.\r\nAnnexation was thought by serious and well meaning men to be\r\nthe necessary remedy--if it could come peaceably. Hence it was\r\nnot rebellion. The annexation movement was communicated to the\r\nUpper Province, but it never had as great a hold anywhere as in\r\nMontreal. There was little aftermath beyond the cancelling of the\r\ncommissions of those who held them at pleasure, a course deemed\r\nnecessary as a protest by the governor general, Lord Elgin.\r\n\r\nIn the beginning of November of this year, 1849, the government\r\noffices were removed to Toronto. In the early part of 1850\r\na party known as the “Clear grits,” composed of the more\r\nprogressive of the reform party in Upper Canada, and dissatisfied\r\nwith the slowness of ministry, elaborated a programme which,\r\namong other heads, advocated, first, the complete application\r\nof the elective principle from the highest to the lowest\r\nmember of the government, and, secondly, universal suffrage. A\r\ncorresponding but more radical movement was organized at Montreal\r\nfor Lower Canada by L.J. Papineau, under the title of “La Parti\r\nRouge.” Its members were mostly young French-Canadians, although\r\na number of British radicals were with them, such as L.H.\r\nHolton, and others. The “Parti Rouge” pronounced in favour of\r\nthe repeal of the Union, of a republican form of government and\r\nof annexation to the States. “La Parti Rouge,” says La Minerve,\r\nthe organ of the “bleus,” “has been formed at Montreal under\r\nthe auspices of Mr. Papineau in hatred of English institutions,\r\nof our constitution, declared to be vicious, and above all, of\r\nresponsible government which is regarded as a takein, with ideas\r\nof innovation in religion and in politics, accompanied by a\r\nprofound hatred for the clergy and with the very formal and very\r\npronounced intention of annexing Canada to the United States.” By\r\nthe end of the year the prospects of trade had so brightened that\r\nwith this annexation and other desperate remedies were forgotten.\r\nIn October the first provincial exhibition of agricultural and\r\nindustrial products was held at Montreal.\r\n\r\nDuring the session of 1851, the legislation for railways was of\r\nprimary importance to Montreal; if it was to keep its place as\r\nthe center of transportation by land as it had been by water it\r\nwould now enter into its new railroad era forced by the competing\r\nenterprises of the adjoining republics. In October the great\r\nLafontaine-Baldwin ministry resigned. Mr. Lafontaine resumed his\r\nlaw practice at Montreal. In the month of August, 1853, he became\r\nchief justice of Lower Canada and held that position to his\r\ndeath, February 26, 1864. Ten years previously, in 1854, he was\r\ncreated a baronet. Sir L. Hippolyte Lafontaine’s name and fame\r\nstand high in the remembrance of Montreal.\r\n\r\nOn the 6th of November the existing parliament was dissolved. In\r\nthe following elections Mr. John Young was returned from Montreal\r\nand was given a place in the Hincks-Morin cabinet as commissioner\r\nof public works. Mr. Papineau was defeated in Montreal, but found\r\na seat for the county of Two Mountains. In the early part of 1852\r\nMr. Hincks visited England and arranged for the capitalizing\r\nof the Grand Trunk Railway to proceed westward from Montreal.\r\nConsequently during the fourth parliament’s first session at\r\nQuebec, which opened on August 19th, conspicuous among the acts\r\npassed was one to incorporate the Grand Trunk Railway. Other\r\nacts interesting to Montrealers were the municipal loan fund act\r\nto enable municipalities to borrow money on the credit of the\r\nprovince for local improvement, an act for the establishment\r\nof a trans-Atlantic line of steamers and the appropriating of\r\n£19,000 sterling per annum for the purpose. The contract was\r\nsecured by McKean, McLarty & Company, of Liverpool, and steamers\r\nbegan to run during the following spring. Two years later the\r\ncontract was annulled and an arrangement was made with Messrs.\r\nEdmonstone, Allan & Company, of Montreal. The small fleet of\r\nthe last named company has since developed into the well known\r\nAllan line of trans-Atlantic steamships. On October 23d Mr.\r\nCharles Wilson, mayor of Montreal, was added to the legislative\r\ncouncil. Before the session ended there occurred the famous\r\nGavazzi riots in Quebec and Montreal, the latter place especially\r\nmaintaining its reputation for mob violence. As the government\r\nwas afterwards attacked for delay in ordering an unavoidable\r\nand searching investigation into the perpetrators of the fatal\r\ndisaster at Montreal the story may be told here rather than in\r\nthe ecclesiastical history of the city. During the spring of\r\n1853 Alessandro Gavazzi, an ex-monk, had been giving a course\r\nof lectures in the States, mostly against Romanism. He had\r\npreviously been received with success in England. Posing as an\r\nItalian patriot of liberty, with the reputation for impassioned\r\nand eloquent oratory and the added piquancy of being an\r\nex-priest, he had attracted elsewhere a favourable hearing. But\r\non his entrance to Lower Canada, at Quebec, he received a check\r\non June 6th when delivering a lecture on the Inquisition in the\r\nFree Church on St. Ursule Street. A scene of disorder occurred in\r\nthe church. The lecturer was attacked in the pulpit, and though\r\nhe defended himself right valiantly with a stool, knocking down\r\nsome sixteen of his assailants, he was overmastered and thrown on\r\nto the heads of the people below. Confusion reigned. The military\r\nwere providentially soon on the scene and quiet obtained. The\r\nproceedings were sufficient to warrant an informal discussion\r\nin the House next day. On the night of the 9th of June Gavazzi\r\nwas in Montreal, lecturing in Zion Church on the Haymarket\r\nsquare, now Victoria Square. Without, to prevent a recurrence of\r\nthe Quebec assault, a posse of police was placed opposite the\r\nchurch, another in the Square and a small body of military, hard\r\nby, in concealment. These were the “Cameronians” but recently\r\narrived in the city. There was an attempt of a body of Catholic\r\nIrishmen to break a way into the church, but they were repulsed.\r\nOn retreating the second time a shot was fired by one of the\r\nintruders who was immediately shot down by a Protestant. Other\r\nshots followed. Confusion reigned. The lecture was hurriedly\r\nconcluded and the people made for home. On the church being\r\nattacked the Gavazzi called for three cheers for the Queen and\r\ncongratulated his hearers on freedom of speech being maintained.\r\nOn their way through the streets shots were fired at them by the\r\nmilitary. Who gave the order to fire has never been discovered.\r\nThe mayor, the Hon. Charles Wilson, who had read the riot act,\r\nwas accused and denied it. So also did Colonel Hogarth, of the\r\nTwenty-sixth Cameronian Rifles, also accused. It is said that the\r\nsoldiers fired, at the order of some one in the crowd, but over\r\nthe heads of the people, so that those making their way up Beaver\r\nHall Hill received the shots. The Cameronians were very unpopular\r\nfor a time. About forty were killed or wounded, of whom many were\r\ninjured by stones and other missiles. Two women were struck down\r\nand almost trampled to death. The scene was one of frenzied riot,\r\nheightened by the screams of women. Gavazzi made his way between\r\ntwo clergymen to St. James street, narrowly escaping with his\r\nlife. He afterwards escaped from St. Lawrence Hall in an inclosed\r\ncab to the wharf, where the Iron Duke took him to La Prairie.\r\nThus his career ended in Canada. On June 26th an investigation\r\nwas held into the causes of the riot, but nothing was the\r\noutcome and there were no apprehensions, at which there was much\r\ndisapproval, as it was thought the affair was being hushed up\r\nas a political move. It is for this reason that the story has\r\nbeen inserted in this portion. The occasion was made an occasion\r\nof _odium theologicum_. At that time the St. Patrick’s Society,\r\nfounded in 1834, was composed of Irishmen of different religions,\r\nbut as Mr. Hincks and the mayor, the Hon. Charles Wilson, were\r\nboth prominent members, Mr. Hincks was accused of being under the\r\ninfluence of the Roman Catholic majority for political purposes.\r\nMr. Drummond, the attorney-general for Lower Canada, being a\r\nCatholic, was also accused in being dilatory in bringing the\r\nrioters to justice.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: L.H. HOLTON]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SIR FRANCIS HINCKS]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: D’ARCY McGEE]\r\n\r\nParliament adjourned on the 14th of June. It did not meet again\r\ntill June 13, 1854, just a day within the limit allowed by the\r\nthirty-first clause of the Union act. The chief reason for this\r\nwas the absence of the governor and the premier in England and at\r\nWashington, at which latter place, on June 15th, the treaty of\r\nreciprocity was signed between the United States and Canada. The\r\nparliament was dissolved in view of the general elections to come\r\nin July and August, when the attitude of the people on the two\r\ngreat questions so long postponed, the clergy reserves and the\r\nseigneurial tenure was to be taken as an index of confidence and\r\ntrust in the government. Mr. L.H. Holton and Mr. (afterwards Sir)\r\nA.A. Dorion, the leader of the “Parti Rouge,” since Mr. Papineau\r\ndid not seek reelection, were returned for Montreal. The country\r\nas a whole had pronounced in favour of the abolition of the\r\nseigneurial tenure and the secularization of the clergy reserves.\r\nThe parliament met on the 5th of September. The rejection of the\r\nministerial candidate, George Etienne Cartier, for speaker in the\r\nassembly, in favour of Mr. Sicotte, indicated to Mr. Hincks and\r\nMr. Morin that they could not carry on the administration against\r\nthe combined opposition of the conservative, clear grits and the\r\n“Parti Rouge.” This was confirmed on September 7th when, on a\r\nquestion of privilege, the opposition carried it. On September\r\n8th the resignation of the Hincks-Morin ministry was accepted\r\nby Lord Elgin. The government fell without dishonour. It had\r\nobtained the imperial acts enabling the Canadian parliament to\r\ndeal with the clergy reserves and the application of the elective\r\nprinciple to the legislative council. It had completed the\r\nreciprocity treaty with the States and had inaugurated the era of\r\nCanadian railway. Montreal largely shared in the prosperity which\r\nprevailed in its term. The task of forming a new ministry was\r\nentrusted by Lord Elgin to Sir Allan MacNab. With the concurrence\r\nof Mr. Morin, Sir Allan effected a coalition between his own\r\nconservative following and the late liberal government resulting\r\nin the liberal-conservative alliance as the only method possible\r\nof obtaining a majority in the assembly capable of conducting\r\nthe administration in accordance with the now accepted principle\r\nof responsible government. The death knell of the old toryism\r\nhad been sounded. It also marked the virtual extinction of the\r\nBritish party in Lower Canada as a separate political body. Since\r\nthat date there may be traced the growth of a more united policy\r\nin Montreal in the common welfare.\r\n\r\nA bill giving effect to the reciprocity treaty with the United\r\nStates was introduced by attorney-general (East), Hon. L.T.\r\nDrummond. The long delayed bill for secularizing the clergy\r\nreserves was introduced by Attorney-General (West), Hon. John A.\r\nMacdonald, and that abolishing the seigneurial tenure originally\r\nintroduced by Mr. L.T. Drummond became law. By the former not\r\nonly the Anglican establishment, but all churches were deprived\r\nof any participation in the funds accruing from the reserved\r\nlands granted for the support of the Anglican communion since the\r\ncommencement of the British régime, a privilege that had been\r\nall along keenly contested by other denominations. It was now\r\nenacted that all proceeds arising from the sale of these lands\r\nshould be placed into the hands of the receiver-general, by whom,\r\nafter expenses were paid, they were to be apportioned equally\r\namong the several county and city municipalities in proportion to\r\npopulation.\r\n\r\nThe Seigneurial Tenure Act while abolishing the system of\r\nfeudal rights and duties so long prevailing in Lower Canada,\r\nauthorized the governor to provide commissioners to appropriate\r\nindemnifications for the despoiled seigneurs. Thus the two great\r\nquestions which had long been exercising Montreal politicians\r\nwere at last solved. Parliament was prorogued on the 18th of\r\nDecember and Lord Elgin concluded his office as governor-general\r\nwith credit and honour.\r\n\r\nParliament opened on February 23, 1855. It was marked by the\r\nretirement of Mr. Morin from the ministry. The McNab-Taché\r\nadministration was therefore formed. The Crimean war was now on,\r\nand as it became necessary to remove the Imperial Troops from\r\nCanada “a militia act was passed, which was the first step toward\r\nthe modern organization of a regular volunteer force in Canada.”\r\n\r\nThe fifth parliament was opened at Toronto on the 15th of\r\nFebruary, 1856. On Her Majesty’s birthday, May 24th, through the\r\nresignation of Sir Allan McNab, the Taché-Macdonald ministry\r\nassumed the reins, in which John A. Macdonald held the whip hand.\r\nIn this session the postponed elective legislative council act\r\nwas passed for which imperial authority had already been given.\r\nWhile those already in the legislative council were to retain\r\ntheir seats for life, every future member was to be elected\r\nby the people for a term of eight years. This continued till\r\nconfederation, in 1867, when the system of appointment for life\r\nwas reverted to. The Montreal members in the legislative council\r\nfor 1856 were the Honourables Peter McGill, William Morris, Adam\r\nFerrie, James Ferrier, Denis B. Viger, James Leslie, Frederic\r\nA. Quesnel, Joseph Bourret and Charles Wilson. This year the\r\nstringency in the money market was felt as the result of the\r\nCrimean war.\r\n\r\nThe year of 1857 is spoken of as _l’année terrible_. The toll of\r\ndeath was exacted as the price of advancing civilization. Near\r\nHamilton seventy lives were lost by a train crashing through a\r\nbridge spanning the Desjardins canal. The steamer Montreal which\r\nplied between Montreal and Quebec, was burned so rapidly near\r\nCape Rouge that about two hundred and fifty emigrants lost their\r\nlives. The harvest was a failure. By the beginning of winter\r\ntrade had become almost stagnant. Mercantile disaster which was\r\nto last for a long time stared the wholesale and retail merchants\r\nin the face. Mercantile credit collapsed and every industry was\r\ncrippled. Agriculture also shared in the general paralysis. The\r\ncause of this disastrous state was the public extravagance in\r\nthat era of public works and railway development. The whirlwind\r\nwas being reaped. During the year the Taché-Macdonald government\r\nhad sat continuously from February 26th to June 10th. The\r\npremier, Colonel Taché, resigned on November 25th and thereupon\r\nthe Hon. John A. Macdonald and the Hon. George Etienne Cartier\r\nformed their administration. At the general elections held in\r\nconsequence at Montreal, Mr. A.A. Dorion, leader of the “Rouge\r\nParty,” was one of the few of his party returned, but Mr. Holton\r\nwas defeated by the new attorney-general.\r\n\r\nA new member for the city was the brilliant young Irishman,\r\nThomas D’Arcy McGee, who had only been a year in Canada. He\r\nwas, however, well known in the United States as a powerful\r\njournalist and public speaker imbued with Irish-American\r\nideas. He was born in Carlingford, County Louth, in Ireland,\r\nin 1825. In his seventeenth year he went to the States and\r\nbegan journalism. In 1845 he undertook the editorship of the\r\n“Freeman’s Journal” in Dublin. Becoming identified with the\r\nNew Ireland party and involved with Charles Gavan Duffy in the\r\nSmith-O’Brien’s insurrection, he escaped to New York, where he\r\nstarted the “New York Nation,” which was suppressed by Bishop\r\nHughes for the attacks on the Irish hierarchy. At Boston he\r\nfounded the “American Celt” and continued it at Buffalo for\r\nfive years. Gradually he became reconciled to the hierarchy\r\nand received their support, so that his paper was the exponent\r\nin America of Irish Catholic opinions. In 1857 he accepted an\r\ninvitation from the Irish party in Montreal to settle here. After\r\nhaving fulfilled the necessary period of “domicile” he was soon\r\nnominated for parliament, as we have seen.\r\n\r\nThe new parliament assembled on February 25th. It had become\r\nknown after the election that Her Majesty had fixed upon Ottawa\r\nas the permanent seat of government. Parliament had ratified the\r\nchoice and a sum of money had been appropriated for the erection\r\nof buildings. But there was serious opposition in many quarters.\r\nIt broke out in the House on July 28th, when Mr. Dunkin moved\r\nan address to the Queen, praying Her Majesty to reconsider the\r\ndecision and have Montreal named instead of Ottawa. Mr. Brown\r\nmoved for an amendment for delay in the erection of buildings and\r\nthe removal of government offices to Ottawa, and Mr. Piché moved\r\nas a further amendment that “in the opinion of this house Ottawa\r\nought not to be the permanent government for the province.” The\r\namendment was carried, supported by the opposition, and being\r\nconsidered by the minority equivalent to a vote of censure on Her\r\nMajesty, the government resigned on the following day. Mr. George\r\nBrown was put in charge of forming a ministry which was announced\r\non Monday, August 2d. At once a vote of want of confidence in\r\nthe new Brown-Dorion government, moved by Mr. Hector Langevin,\r\nwas passed in the Assembly and in the Upper House. On Wednesday\r\nafternoon after having been in office for forty-eight hours\r\nand without having initiated a single act, parliamentary or\r\nadministrative, the short-lived administration was forced to\r\nresign. On August 6th George Cartier becoming prime minister, the\r\nCartier-Macdonald ministry virtually resumed the situation of the\r\nMacdonald-Cartier government of a few days ago. The portfolios,\r\nhowever, were exchanged and thus, by making use of a statute\r\nof 1857 there was avoided the necessity of the ministers going\r\nto the people for reelection. This was known as the “Double\r\nShuffle.” The reconstructed government found themselves with a\r\nstrong majority. During the session of this year the question of\r\n“protection to home industries,” a live subject at Montreal, came\r\nup for legislation and was followed by the protective tariff of\r\nthe following year.\r\n\r\nThe government offices having been removed from Toronto,\r\nparliament met at Quebec on January 29th, for the government\r\noffices were not removed to Ottawa till 1865, where the first\r\nsession was held in 1866. During this year the principle of\r\nConfederation began to be broached tentatively but surely, by the\r\nopposition party led by Mr. George Brown. A reform convention in\r\nToronto held in November drew up a series of resolutions which,\r\nwhen compared with the British North American act of 1867, show\r\na clear family likeness. At Montreal similar meetings were held\r\nunder the auspices of Messrs. Dorion, Drummond, McGee and others\r\nfor the same purpose of approving a federal union, but as yet the\r\nmovement was weak in Lower Canada.\r\n\r\nThe sixth parliament met at Quebec for its fourth and last\r\nsession on the 16th of March, 1861. By a proclamation of the\r\ngovernor-general on the 10th of June it came to an end.\r\n\r\nOn the 8th of November there occurred in mid-ocean, during\r\nthe Civil war in the States between the North and South, the\r\n“Trent Incident,” which caused a commotion at Montreal and\r\nthroughout Canada. The British Mail steamer Trent had on board\r\nthe Confederate envoys, Messrs. Mason and Slidell, when they were\r\nforcibly taken prisoners by Captain Wilkes of the United States\r\nsloop of war San Jacinto. War looked inevitable and the Canadian\r\nVolunteers were augmented, drilled and ready for war. Regular\r\nmilitary troops arrived also from England. The first day of the\r\nnew year, 1862, saw the envoys delivered back to England and the\r\ndanger of war was over. One result of the “Trent” affair was a\r\ngreat deepening of the Canadian sympathy, especially at Montreal,\r\nwith the southern Confederacy.\r\n\r\nIn 1862 the Cartier-Macdonald government fell, on the occasion of\r\ntheir “Militia Bill,” on May 21st, and on the 24th the Macdonald\r\n(J.S.)-Sicotte ministry was sworn in, being succeeded on May 26,\r\n1863, by the Macdonald (J.S.)-Dorion combination, which only\r\nlasted till the 2d of March, 1864, when the Taché-Macdonald\r\n(J.A.) again came into power. It was agreed upon, that the\r\ngovernment should be pledged to introduce the federal principle\r\ninto Canada and to aim at a confederation in which all British\r\nAmerica should be “united under a general legislature based upon\r\nthe federal principle.”\r\n\r\nThe idea of confederation as a remedy for government ills had\r\noccupied attention at intervals with increasing acuteness even\r\nbefore the Union of 1841. It had not been confined to Upper and\r\nLower Canada, for Nova Scotia, New Brunswick and Prince Edward\r\nIsland had long discussed the idea of a union among themselves.\r\nVarious political dreamers had forecasted it, no doubt following\r\nthe lead of the United States. A meeting for the purpose being\r\ncalled at Charlottetown, Prince Edward Island, the coalition\r\ngovernment of Canada sent eight ministers[3] to confer with\r\ntheir representatives on the merits of a larger scheme of union\r\nbetween all the provinces with the result that by agreement a\r\nfurther convention was to be held at Quebec on a day named by\r\nthe governor general. His excellency fixed upon October 10th and\r\nnotified the respective lieutenant governors of Nova Scotia, New\r\nBrunswick, Prince Edward Island and Newfoundland. The result was\r\nthe pledge to promote the projected confederation.\r\n\r\nDuring the fall of this year, 1864, Montreal was the scene of\r\nthe St. Alban’s Raid prosecutions. As already said, Canada and\r\nMontreal especially had sympathized with the Southerners. Many\r\nrefugees had found a home here. Canada being so close to the\r\nfrontier was, therefore, frequently used as the basis of southern\r\nplots. In the summer two vessels plying on Lake Erie and Lake\r\nOntario, belonging to American merchants, had been seized and\r\npartially plundered by the southern refugees. In September St.\r\nAlbans, a little town in Vermont, on the frontier, was raided by\r\ntwenty-three southerners from Canada under the command of Bennett\r\nH. Young, an ex-Confederate soldier, who escaped to Canada on\r\ncaptured horses with $223,000 booty, after having plundered\r\nthree local banks and shot one of the cashiers. Their excuse\r\nwas that they were representatives of the Confederate States of\r\nAmerica and they were there to retaliate the outrages committed\r\nby General Sherman. In November the trial of the captured rioters\r\ntook place at Montreal and on March 30th they were discharged.\r\n\r\nParliament met on the 19th of January. It was prorogued on\r\nthe 18th of March. During the following month four of the\r\nadministration, J.A. Macdonald, Cartier, Brown and Galt,\r\nproceeded to England to discuss with the imperial government\r\nthe scheme of confederation. The delegates returned in time for\r\nthe opening of the last session of the Canadian legislature at\r\nQuebec on the 8th of August. The premier, Sir E.P. Taché, had\r\ndied full of honours on the 30th of July. He was succeeded by Sir\r\nN.F. Belleau. During this session the bill was passed to carry\r\nout the recommendation of the commissioners appointed in 1857\r\n“to reduce into one code to be called the civil code of Lower\r\nCanada those provisions of the laws of Lower Canada which relate\r\nto civil matters and are of a general and permanent character.”\r\nAttorney-General Cartier who had introduced the bill appointing\r\nthe commission in 1857 had the satisfaction of seeing its labours\r\nadopted in 1865. The code came into operation in 1866. This was\r\nwelcomed by the jurists of Montreal and Quebec, as it simplified\r\nthe law, reducing order out of chaos; the abolition of the\r\nseigneurial tenure act of 1854 had rendered the codification very\r\nnecessary. Parliament closed on the 18th of September. The public\r\noffices were removed to Ottawa during the autumn, but for a time\r\nthe cabinet meetings were held at Montreal.\r\n\r\nIn the beginning of 1866 a delegation was sent by the government\r\nto Washington to obtain a renewal of the reciprocity treaty\r\nwhich came to an end this year. The mission was a failure. St.\r\nPatrick’s day, March 17th, was looked forward to in Canada by\r\nmore than those of Irish nationality. For although during the\r\nyear 1865 rumours had gone around that the Fenian Brotherhood of\r\nthe States, organized about this time with a branch in Ireland\r\nto liberate Ireland, had determined to invade Canada as a base\r\nof their operations against England, they were not taken very\r\nseriously. But in 1866 the announcement of combined movements\r\nupon Canada to commence on St. Patrick’s day forced serious\r\npreparation for their reception and caused great anxiety over the\r\ncountry and much recruiting in volunteer circles. St. Patrick’s\r\nday passed and nothing happened. Beginning, however, in April\r\nand gaining strength in May and June, the filibustering Fenians\r\nmassed their forces at various points, such as that marked by the\r\nraid under O’Neill upon the Niagara frontier in June, that of\r\nOgdensburg, menacing a march upon Ottawa, and that at St. Albans\r\non the Vermont frontier, where 1,800 men had collected on June\r\n7th to pass over into Canada. In Montreal doubtless they hoped\r\nto find some sympathizers. None of these movements met eventual\r\nsuccess and quiet was successfully maintained on the frontier by\r\nboth governments. But these were the occasion of military ardour,\r\nshown by the enrollments of the militia and of general patriotism.\r\n\r\nThe parliament met at Ottawa on the 8th of June in the midst\r\nof the Fenian excitement. The address of His Excellency, the\r\ngovernor general, forecasted the hope that the next time\r\nparliament met at Ottawa it would be under the confederation\r\nof Province. It lasted to the 15th of August. About three months\r\nlater a joint delegation of the representatives of Canada, Nova\r\nScotia, and New Brunswick met on December 4th in London at the\r\nWestminster Palace Hotel and a conference was held. Prince Edward\r\nIsland and Newfoundland had seceded from the project. The upshot\r\nof the negotiations was such that on the 22d of May, 1867, the\r\nConfederation Act, technically known as “the British North\r\nAmerican Act, 1867,” was proclaimed at Windsor Castle by Her\r\nMajesty, Queen Victoria, appointing the 1st of July following as\r\nthe date upon which it should come into force. This act joined\r\nCanada (Upper and Lower), Nova Scotia and New Brunswick into\r\none Dominion, under the name of CANADA. There should be one\r\nfederal parliament, consisting of the Queen, represented by the\r\ngovernor general, an _upper house_ consisting of seventy-two\r\n_life_ members appointed by the Crown, and a House of Commons\r\n_elected_ on the principle of representation by population. Its\r\njurisdiction was to affect matters concerning the Dominion at\r\nlarge. Each of the four provinces of Quebec, Ontario, Nova Scotia\r\nand New Brunswick was to have a provincial legislature to manage\r\nits internal affairs. Each was to have a lieutenant governor. In\r\nOntario the legislature consisted only of a house of assembly. In\r\nthe other three provinces a council was added.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CONFEDERATION SISTERS Arranged from studies of the\r\nCartier monument (G.W. Hill) being erected in 1914]\r\n\r\nIn the following year the northwest territories were added to the\r\nDominion, in 1870 Manitoba, in 1871 British Columbia, and in 1873\r\nPrince Edward Island, and in 1905 the new provinces of Alberta\r\nand Saskatchewan were established. Since confederation the\r\nhistory of Canada has been one of continued commercial and social\r\ndevelopment. The British North American act was the Magna Charta\r\nof Canadian nationhood.\r\n\r\nMontreal is proud of the share it took in the promotion of\r\nConfederation.\r\n\r\n       LEGISLATIVE ASSEMBLY FOR MONTREAL DISTRICT FROM THE\r\n         CONSTITUTIONAL ACT, 1791 TO CONFEDERATION, 1867\r\n\r\n                             MEMBERS\r\n\r\n  Montreal (County)--\r\n\r\n    Papineau, Joseph                       July 10, 1792, to May 31, 1796\r\n    Walker, James                          July 10, 1792, to May 31, 1796\r\n    Ducharme, Jean-Marie                   July 20, 1796, to June 4, 1800\r\n    Guy, Et.

As\r\nearly as 1786, on the invitation of the Superior Council, they\r\nhad reported in favour of the incorporation by charter of a\r\nmunicipality, but notwithstanding, the system of government by\r\njustices of the peace was continued. At a meeting of October\r\n23, 1821, the citizens again agitated for a charter. In 1828\r\na great meeting was held on December 6th and resolutions were\r\npassed to the effect that in the flourishing state of the\r\ngrowth of population and the progress of trade the government\r\nby magistrates was not sufficient to provide for municipal\r\nadvance in the future; that among the evils due to insufficient\r\npowers granted to the magistrates was the inefficiency of police\r\nregulations and the want of an efficient system of bookkeeping\r\nin the appropriation of the revenues of the town; the deplorable\r\nstate for many years of the water front and the lands adjoining\r\nthe “little river,” which by their unhealthy condition, had\r\nbecome dangerous to the well being of the great part of the\r\nsurrounding population; the lack of means and authority for\r\nundertaking and executing a preconceived and general plan of\r\nimprovement, it being left to the individual to put obstacles\r\nto the proper growth of the town which narrowness of view and\r\nself-interest might suggest to the delay in growth and the\r\nincrease of avoidable expenses. The citizens concluded by\r\ndemanding from the legislature the incorporation of the town. The\r\ncommittee formed to present the petition was as follows: For the\r\ntown, J.B. Rolland, P. McGill, J. Quesnell and A. Laframbroise;\r\nfor the districts of St. Antoine, St. Ann and the Recollets,\r\nJohn Fry, Father Desautels, John Torrance, Charles de Lorimier,\r\nC. Wagner and H. Corse; for St. Lawrence, C.S. Delorme, A.\r\nTullock (Père), A. Tullock (Fils), John Baptiste Castonguay,\r\nB. Hall and Louis de Chantal; for the Quebec and St. Louis\r\ndistricts, John Richelieu, Louis Parthenais, Francis Derome and\r\nC.S. Rodier.\r\n\r\nIn 1830 the harbour commission was appointed as a partial remedy.\r\n\r\nIn 1831 the first act incorporating the city of Montreal was\r\npresented on March 31st for the sanction of His Majesty,\r\nwhich was given on April 12, 1832, its publication being by\r\nproclamation of the governor general on June 5th following. On\r\nthe 18th of July, 1833, the city council unanimously adopted\r\nthe seal of the arms of the city, the Beaver,[1] the Rose, the\r\nShamrock and the Thistle, and its motto, “Concordia Salus.”\r\nBy this act under the name of “The Corporation of the City of\r\nMontreal” the city was divided into eight wards, East, West, St.\r\nAnn, St. Joseph, St. Antoine, St. Lawrence, St. Louis and St.\r\nMary. Each was to elect two councillors with certain financial\r\nqualifications, and these sixteen were to elect from their number\r\none to act as mayor to whom a salary not exceeding four hundred\r\ndollars should be granted. The right of citizenship was to be\r\naccorded to every man attaining the age of twenty-one years and\r\npossessing real estate in the limits of the city and having\r\nresided therein for twelve months prior to the election. Every\r\nelector became a member of the corporation. The corporation\r\nacquired powers to borrow, acquire and possess property, to take\r\naction at law, to be in turn liable to legal prosecution and\r\nto have a seal. The other powers granted them were similar to\r\nthose exercised hitherto by the justices of the peace for the\r\ngovernment and maintenance of the city. The act was not to remain\r\nin force after May 1, 1836.\r\n\r\nOn the first Monday in May, 1833, the justices of the peace met\r\nto appoint the first Monday of June as the day of election of\r\nthe councillors. These, when elected, met on June 5th in the\r\ncourthouse for the first séance. Jacques Viger, who acted as\r\nsecretary, was elected the first mayor, the councillors being\r\nJohn Donegani, William Forbes, Joseph Gauvin, Alexander Lusignan,\r\nJohn McDonell, Robert Nelson, C.S. Rodier, Joseph Roy, John\r\nTorrance, Augustin Tullock, John Turney, Guillaume J. Vallée,\r\nFrançois Dérome, Mahum Hall, Julien Perrault, and Turton Penn.\r\nThe secretary appointed was Francis Auger. On the first Monday\r\nof June, each year, half of the council had to be replaced or\r\nre-elected. The charter required that each regulation of the\r\ncouncil before taking effect should be submitted for approbation\r\nto the court of King’s Bench after having been published in the\r\nnewspapers and by town criers.\r\n\r\nThis charter remained in force till May 1, 1836, when for\r\nunaccountable reasons its renewal was refused, and the justices\r\nof the peace again ruled the city till August, 1840. These,\r\nfollowing the official lists, were: Denis B. Viger, Peter\r\nMcGill, Pierre de Rocheblave, William Robertson, Lawrence Kidd,\r\nJames Miller, Austin Cuvillier, James Quesnel, Adam L. McNiver,\r\nJoseph Shuter, William Hall, Jos. Ant. Gagnon, Daniel Arnoldi,\r\nE.M. Leprohon, George S. Holt, Joseph T. Barrett, Jacob DeWitt,\r\nPierre Lukin, Turton Penn, Thomas Cringan, Joseph Masson, Henry\r\nCorse, John Molson, Sidney Bellingham, James Browne, Pierre E.\r\nLeclere, John Donegani, Guillaume J. Vallée, Charles Lamontagne,\r\nHenri Desrivières, Theophile Dufort, Benjamin Hart, James McGill\r\nDesrivières, Charles S. Rodier, John Jones, Charles Tate, Hugh E.\r\nBarron, Alexis Laframboise, J. Bte. Castonguay, Patrice Lacombe,\r\nOlivier Berthelet, Paul Jos. LaCroix, Thomas B. Wragg, M.J.\r\nHayes, Etienne Guy, Logan Fuller, François P. Bruneau, Pierre\r\nLouis Panet, Hugh Brodie, Joseph Baby, Alexander Buchanan, John\r\nDyke and William Evans. The clerks of the justices were Delisle\r\nand Delisle, then Delisle and Brehaut.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SEAL OF THE CITY OF MONTREAL]\r\n\r\nDuring this period Lord Durham arrived and his report\r\nanimadverting on the absence of municipal government in Montreal\r\nand Quebec, doubtless caused the reintroduction of the municipal\r\ncouncil under the name of the mayor, the aldermen and the\r\ncitizens of the city of Montreal. The governor, Mr. C. Poulett\r\nThomson (afterwards Lord Sydenham) was authorized to name the\r\nfirst council for the first term to end on December 2, 1842. His\r\nchoice was as follows: Mayor, the Hon. Peter McGill; councillors,\r\nJules Quesnel, Adam Ferrier, C.S. Rodier, J.G. McKenzie, C.S.\r\nDe Bleury, J.M. Tobin, Olivier Berthelet, F. Bruneau, Hippolyte\r\nGuy, John Donegani, Charles Tate, J.W. Dunscomb, Thomas Philipps,\r\nColin Campbell, Stanley Bagg, Archibald Hume, D. Handside and\r\nWilliam Molson. On September 12, J.P. Sexton was appointed city\r\nclerk and remained in office till 1858.\r\n\r\nIn 1843 the second council was elected by the people from six\r\nwards only, viz., East, Center, West, Queen, St. Lawrence and St.\r\nMary. These councillors, two for each ward, elected the mayor\r\nfrom among themselves, as well as six other citizens under the\r\ntitle of aldermen who all composed the council as follows: Mayor,\r\nJoseph Bourret; aldermen, Joseph Masson, Benjamin Holmes, William\r\nMolson, Joseph Roy, Joseph Redpath, C.S. De Bleury; councillors,\r\nJames Ferrier, Pierre Jodoin, Peter Dunn, William Lunn, William\r\nWatson, Olivier Frechette, Pierre Beaubien, P.A. Gagnon, François\r\nTrudeau, François Perrin, and John Mathewson. The six wards into\r\nwhich the city was divided were: East, Center, West, Queen, St.\r\nLawrence and St. Mary. In 1845 the city was divided into nine\r\nwards, the city wards being East, Center and West and having each\r\nthree representatives in the council, the other six, called the\r\nsuburban wards, only having two councillors each. Thus the whole\r\ncouncil had twenty-one members.\r\n\r\nThis system obtained till 1852,[2] when by the statute Victoria,\r\n14, 15, chapter 128, passed in 1851, the election of the mayor\r\npassed from the council to the people at large. The first thus\r\nelected was the Hon. Charles Wilson. The number of the aldermen\r\nwas raised to nine and each of the suburban wards received the\r\nsame rights as the city wards to three representatives. This\r\nbrought the council up to twenty-seven members. The statute of\r\n1851 only imposed four quarterly sessions of the council, but the\r\nmayor had the right, however, to call special meetings. As an\r\ninstance of the parochial measures then engaging the thoughts of\r\nour municipal rulers, we may quote the following relating to the\r\nbreaking of a monopoly:\r\n\r\n“Mayor Wolfred Nelson, in his address to the Council in 1854,\r\nafter alluding to the pestilence which had visited the city and\r\nthe poverty which followed, said: ‘The misery in which we have\r\nbeen involved would have been immeasurably greater had not the\r\nCouncil adopted energetic measures having the effect of breaking\r\ndown a cursed monopoly--that of firewood--by purchasing several\r\nhundred cords of firewood and selling it in small lots at cost\r\nprice; as well as of arresting the most extraordinary practice\r\nof converting our greatest thoroughfares, the wharves, into wood\r\nyards by speculators and monopolists, who prevented the purchase\r\nof wood in small quantities from the boats. The adoption of\r\nthese measures in one week reduced the price of fuel over one\r\nquarter, at a period when it had been boasted that it would be\r\nworth ten or twelve dollars a cord during the winter. Instead of\r\nthis exhorbitant rate the best wood can now be obtained for $6 a\r\ncord.’”\r\n\r\nIn 1859 Charles Glackmeyer was appointed city clerk and remained\r\nin office till 1892, when he was succeeded by L.O. David till\r\ntoday.\r\n\r\nIn 1874 (Victoria 37, Chapter 41) the charter was amended and\r\nthe name of the corporation was changed to that of “The City of\r\nMontreal.” The distinction between aldermen and councillors was\r\nabolished, the title for all being that of aldermen, who were all\r\nelected by the people.\r\n\r\nThe history of Greater Montreal now begins in the annexation of\r\nthe rural municipalities. In 1883 the new Hochelaga ward added\r\nthree aldermen; in 1886 that of St. Jean Baptiste three others;\r\nin 1887 St. Gabriel ward also added three.\r\n\r\nCommenting on the state of civic politics under this charter a\r\ncontemporary has the following chatty appreciation:[3]\r\n\r\n  “For many years the English-speaking element had dominated in\r\n  civic affairs by virtue of a very small majority in the City\r\n  Council, and there was just a little tendency among the city\r\n  fathers forming that majority, not only to dominate but to\r\n  domineer. They were not disposed to be unjust to the citizens\r\n  who formed the majority of the electorate, but they showed a\r\n  lack of tact amounting at times to a want of delicacy in dealing\r\n  with and speaking of the diverse elements of the population.\r\n  The French-Canadians had the good sense to elect their ablest\r\n  men. To be quite frank there was a long period during which the\r\n  English-speaking people seemed to think that almost anybody was\r\n  good enough to make an alderman. The result was inevitable.\r\n  Each ward was represented by three aldermen, one retiring each\r\n  year and the English-speaking majority in the Center Ward was\r\n  in 1880 only a little one. It took just three years of good\r\n  electioneering work to replace three English-speaking aldermen\r\n  by three French-Canadians. The latter element now dominated the\r\n  Council and to prevent accident Hochelaga was annexed in 1883.\r\n  This not only brought in three more French-Canadian aldermen on\r\n  December 1, 1883, but it brought in Raymond Préfontaine, who was\r\n  a host in himself, and who almost immediately became the ruling\r\n  spirit in civic affairs. Of course, most of the English-speaking\r\n  aldermen did not take kindly to the new régime and Raymond\r\n  Préfontaine got his full share of their hot shot and it hurt\r\n  him as much as water hurts a duck’s back. The attitude of most\r\n  of the English journalists (including the writer) must have\r\n  been consoling to the Council minority, on account of the sweet\r\n  sympathy expressed. ‘The Honest Minority,’ the ‘Noble Thirteen,’\r\n  the ‘Faithful Anti-Monopolists’ were among the compliments\r\n  lavished by a discriminating press; and were taken not only\r\n  seriously but appreciatively by the recipients, some of whom were\r\n  in the habit of discussing on the floor of the Council their\r\n  own sterling qualities with a frankness which left nothing to\r\n  be desired. One of the noblest Romans of them all could seldom\r\n  speak of his own honesty (and he had no false delicacy about\r\n  introducing the subject), without shedding tears and sobbing.\r\n  Strangers might have imagined he was crying over his lost\r\n  opportunities, but he wasn’t; it was just his way.\r\n\r\n  “Time is apt to and ought to modify our judgments of our\r\n  fellowmen. Let it be said for Raymond Préfontaine by one who\r\n  generally disagreed with his plans and disapproved of his public\r\n  actions that among his qualities were some decidedly good\r\n  ones. He was a man of his word and a man of ideas and infinite\r\n  resource. He was the first public man to set about systematic\r\n  modernizing and development of Montreal. When he talked about\r\n  electric cars and electric lighting, he was laughed to scorn by\r\n  the ‘Noble Minority’ in the Council and the rest of the nobility\r\n  outside the Council. He went in for street widening and permanent\r\n  paving (no doubt at an expensive rate) and he added to the size\r\n  of the debt as well as to the size of the city. He was, in fact,\r\n  Montreal’s Baron Haussmann. The Baron was ‘fired’ by the Olivier\r\n  government for his financial extravagance; he only borrowed a\r\n  hundred million dollars, from 1865 to 1869; but he made the\r\n  modern Paris.\r\n\r\n  “The Noble Thirteen and their admirers, like the coloured troops\r\n  in the American Civil war fought nobly against Mr. Préfontaine’s\r\n  schemes and predicted unmerciful disaster if the City Passenger\r\n  Railway were electrified. To the plea that electric railways\r\n  were a success elsewhere the opposition replied triumphantly and\r\n  without fear of contradiction ‘but New York isn’t Montreal’--and\r\n  neither Alderman Préfontaine nor any of his followers ever dared\r\n  to take up the challenge and prove that New York was Montreal.\r\n\r\n  “Then the Noble Thirteen had its own troubles. One, at least,\r\n  lost his patent of nobility by voting wrong on the gas question;\r\n  another was laid out on the City Passenger Railway Monopoly; a\r\n  third was promoted to the retired list because his popularity\r\n  threatened to make him a dangerous rival to another nobleman in\r\n  a parliamentary election. Strenuous opponents of ‘monopoly’ in\r\n  street railways became first lukewarm, then indifferent, then\r\n  apologetic, and finally strenuous supporters of Monopoly with\r\n  the biggest ‘M’ in the printer’s upper case. Most of the Noble\r\n  Thirteen have gone to a better world, which is a good thing for\r\n  them, because if they were still in the Council, they would miss\r\n  the old admiration dreadfully.”\r\n\r\nThe city charter was recast in 1898 and the work was confided to\r\nthe mayor, Raymond Préfontaine, Aldermen Rainville, Beausoleil,\r\nMartineau, Laporte, McBride, Ames and Archambault, aided by the\r\ncity law officers and the heads of departments. This commission\r\nrevised and examined clause by clause the preliminary draft\r\nprepared by Messrs. Choquette and Weir, appointed revising\r\nadvocates in conjunction with the city clerk and the city\r\nattorneys. The new charter, a progressive document, was\r\nsanctioned on the 10th of March, 1899. By it Montreal was divided\r\ninto seventeen wards called respectively East, Center, West, St.\r\nAnn, St. Antoine South, St. Antoine West, St. Antoine East, St.\r\nLawrence, St. Louis, St. James South, St. James North, St. Mary\r\nWest, St. Mary East, Hochelaga, St. Jean Baptiste, St. Gabriel\r\nand St. Denis. In 1903 Duvernay Ward was formed with a part of\r\nSt. Jean Baptiste Ward. Among the clauses of this charter was one\r\ngiving power to the council to extend the limits of the city and\r\nto annex municipalities. The elections now began to take place\r\nevery two years instead of annually. The mayor’s qualifications\r\nrequired that he should possess real estate in the city under his\r\nown name to the value of $10,000. His yearly salary was not to\r\nexceed four thousand dollars. The property qualification for an\r\nalderman was fixed at $2,000 and his yearly indemnity at $600,\r\nwith an additional sum of $200 for every chairman of a permanent\r\ncommittee. These permanent committees were appointed at the\r\nfirst monthly meeting in February for the year and apportioned\r\nthe general superintendents and administration of the various\r\ncity departments among themselves. These were supplemented by an\r\noccasional special committee. The council assembled once a month,\r\non the second Monday, but the mayor could convoke a special\r\nmeeting on notice given to each alderman. Five members of the\r\ncouncil could also call a special meeting. The mayor could only\r\ncast his vote when there was an equality of votes.\r\n\r\nThe fault of the civic administration under this charter was\r\nin the ever-growing abuses arising from the system of standing\r\ncommittees of aldermen conflicting with one another, delaying\r\nthe course of business. Towards its close corruption and\r\ninefficiency were rampant under the monopoly of a few who became\r\nstigmatized in the mouths of the citizens as the “23.” In 1909 a\r\nroyal commission was appointed to examine into the malversations\r\nunder the late administration. On December 12, 1909, Mr. Justice\r\nCannon presented his report, in which he named twenty-three of\r\nthe aldermen as guilty of malpractices. Twenty-two of these were\r\nnot returned in the subsequent elections. The following general\r\nconclusion may be taken as a summary of his recommendations and\r\nfindings:\r\n\r\n1. The administration of the affairs of the city of Montreal\r\nby its Council has, since 1892, been saturated with corruption\r\narising especially from the patronage plague.\r\n\r\n2. The majority of the aldermen have administered the committees\r\nand the council in such a manner as to favor the private\r\ninterests of their relatives and friends, to whom contracts\r\nand positions were distributed to the detriment of the general\r\ninterests of the city and of the taxpayers.\r\n\r\n3. As a result of this administration, the annual revenue of\r\n$5,000,000 has been spent as follows: 25 per cent in bribes and\r\nmalversation of all kinds; as for the balance, the greater part\r\nhas been employed in works of which the permanence has very often\r\nbeen ephemeral.\r\n\r\n6. As for the division and the representation of the city by\r\nwards, all agree in condemning this system, which gave rise\r\nto patronage and to its abuses. I recommend to the citizens\r\nof Montreal, after a serious study of this question, to\r\nadopt another system creating a council composed of aldermen\r\nrepresenting the entire city and working in unity for its growth\r\nand prosperity.\r\n\r\n7. The council of today is composed of groups and coteries\r\nstruggling one with another with such bitterness that they\r\nnecessarily lose sight of the high interests of the community.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile many of the prominent citizens, about 1908, began to\r\nprepare for a charter reform. In 1909 the “Citizens’ Association”\r\nwas formed for governmental reform. Its president was an\r\nex-mayor, Mr. Hormisdas Laporte, and the honorary treasurer\r\nwas Mr. James Morgan, a prominent merchant and a good citizen,\r\nwho personally contributed to the funds of the campaign, begun\r\nthen and carried on for some years, very substantial sums\r\nof money and its other adherents, men of solid and approved\r\ncitizenship. The object of the charter reformers was to remedy\r\nthe prevalent abuses by a reduction of the number of aldermen\r\nto one representative to each ward, making thirty-one in the\r\ncouncil, and by a curtailment of their powers, reducing them to\r\na purely legislative body, with no executive power in financial\r\nmatters. This latter function was to be held by a body of four\r\ncommissioners or “controllers” and the mayor elected from the\r\ncity at large. It was hoped that by this adaptation of the\r\n“commission” form of government, then obtaining great prominence\r\nin muncipal literature in the United States, where the method was\r\nbeing practiced, that the waste of civic energy, time and money\r\nwould be best secured by a small executive board elected by the\r\npeople at large and uninfluenced by ward politics. The charter\r\nfor the Board of Control, (9 Edw. Chap. 82) of 1909, at the\r\nrequest of Farquhar Robertson, Charles Chaput, Victor Morin, S.D.\r\nVallières and others, was accordingly secured from the provincial\r\ngovernment after a plebiscite had been previously taken in favour\r\nof this great radical change of government, the most important\r\nsince the original municipal charter in 1831. The new form had\r\nalready been foreseen by Mayor Wilson Smith in his valedictory\r\naddress in 1896. He said:\r\n\r\n“The question has been frequently discussed, both in the Council\r\nand outside of it, as to whether the aldermen should be paid\r\nfor their services. I have to acknowledge that one result of my\r\nexperience has been to change my mind on this subject. I am now\r\ndecidedly of the opinion that not only should the aldermen be\r\nremunerated for their services, but that they should be relieved,\r\nas far as possible, of attending to purely administrative duties.\r\nAnd it is worthy of serious consideration whether it would not be\r\nin the best interests of the city to appoint paid Commissioners\r\nto superintend all details, in connection with the civic\r\nadministration. These Commissioners might have associated with\r\nthem the heads of the departments, with the Mayor as chairman,\r\nwho might form an Advisory Board, and submit all matters to the\r\nCity Council, which would act as a legislative body, but their\r\nrecommendations should be subject to a veto of a two-thirds vote\r\nof the Council. The Commissioners might be three in number, one\r\nof whom could be elected by the rate-payers generally, one by\r\nthe real estate owners, and one by a two-thirds vote of the City\r\nCouncil; said Commissioners to be under the control of the City\r\nCouncil, and subject to dismissal for cause, by a two-thirds vote\r\nof the Council.”\r\n\r\nIn virtue of the recent change in the charter, the new Board of\r\nControl was invested with the following powers:\r\n\r\n1. To prepare the annual budget and to submit it to the council;\r\n\r\n2. To recommend every expense, no expense or matter referring to\r\ncity finances being able to be adopted unless recommended by the\r\ncontrollers;\r\n\r\n3. The council on the report of the controllers to be charged with\r\nthe granting of franchises and privileges by regulation, resolutions,\r\ncontracts, by the issue of debentures and contraction of loans;\r\n\r\n4. The controllers were further to prepare contracts and plans,\r\nto ask for tenders, to decide all formalities relating to the\r\nlatter, to receive and to open such;\r\n\r\n5. To inspect or oversee public works;\r\n\r\n6. To employ the money voted by the council for the purpose\r\ndesigned;\r\n\r\n7. To nominate and suspend all employees, except those nominated\r\nby the council whose nomination, suspension and dismissal should\r\nbe made by the council on the recommendation of the controllers;\r\n\r\n8. No report or recommendation made by the controllers to be\r\nexecuted without the acceptation of the majority of the council;\r\n\r\n9. No amendment to a report or recommendation of the controllers\r\nto be made without the approbation of two-thirds of the members\r\nof the council present at the meeting.\r\n\r\nThe work now to be given to the Board of Control was that\r\nhitherto done by eleven committees of the aldermen of seven\r\nmembers in each.\r\n\r\nThe Citizens’ Association undertaking the campaign for good\r\ngovernment and the conduct of the forthcoming elections formed\r\nup in the middle of 1909, and was hailed by all good citizens,\r\nreceiving the support of all public and volunteer associations\r\nhaving a civic tendency. About this time an important association\r\nwas formally inaugurated on April 12, 1909, by His Excellency\r\nEarl Grey entitled the “City Improvement League,” and lent its\r\naid in the campaign of education on good government and civic\r\nprogress. Other societies also cooperated. The women associations\r\nunder the local Council of Women on the English-speaking side,\r\nand La Fédération Nationale St. Jean Baptiste on the French,\r\nentered more largely than ever before into the movement for civic\r\nprogress and influenced the women voters for clean government.\r\nThe choice of the people for the new officers was made on\r\nFebruary 1, 1910, when the “whole slate for the board” prepared\r\nby the Citizens’ Association was unanimously adopted at the\r\npolls as follows: Mayor, J.J. Guerin, M.D.; controllers, E.P.\r\nLachapelle, M.D., president of the Provincial Board of Health;\r\nL.N. Dupuis, merchant; Joseph Ainey, labour candidate; and F.L.\r\nWanklyn, a civil engineer and former manager of the Montreal\r\nStreet Railway. (The latter resigned in the fall of 1911 and\r\nwas succeeded by the election in the spring of 1912 of Mr. C.H.\r\nGodfrey.) The thirty-one wards were represented as follows:\r\n\r\n  East                      L.A. Lapointe\r\n  Centre                    J.Z. Resther\r\n  West                      S.J. Carter *\r\n  St. Ann                   T. O’Connell *\r\n  St. Joseph                U.H. Dandurand\r\n  St. Andrew                Joseph Ward *\r\n  St. George                Leslie H.

Garceau, M.D.\r\n  St. Jean Baptiste         Noé Leclaire\r\n  St. Gabriel               Patrick Monahan *\r\n  St. Denis                 Ernest D. Tétreau\r\n  Duvernay                  Ludger Clément\r\n  St. Henry                 O. Letourneau, M.D.\r\n  St. Cunegonde             N. Lapointe\r\n  Mount Royal               A.E. Prud’homme, N.P.\r\n  De Lorimier               George Mayrand, N.P.\r\n  Laurier                   N. Turcot\r\n  Notre Dame de Graces      George Marcil\r\n  St. Paul                  M. Judge\r\n  Ahuntsic                  T. Bastien\r\n  Emard                     J.U. Emard, K.C.\r\n  Longue Pointe             E. Larivière\r\n  Bordeaux                  E. Lussier\r\n  Cote des Neiges           A.S. Deguire\r\n  Rosemount                 J.N. Drummond *\r\n\r\n  * English-Speaking.\r\n\r\nThe consequent dispatch in city business, the improvement in\r\npublic works, the strengthening of heads of departments in the\r\ncity hall, hitherto hampered by aldermanic interference, and the\r\nabolition of patronage secured universal approbation of the new\r\nform of civic government. After awhile the spirit of opposition\r\namong a certain number of the aldermen began to jeopardize the\r\nearly universal acceptance of the board of control system.\r\nAgain the Citizens’ Association, with its backing, had to seek\r\nto strengthen the hands of the Board of Control. The following\r\nextracts from the Secretary of the Board of Trade’s annual report\r\n(Mr. George Hadrill) will indicate the new phase:\r\n\r\n“In 1908, it being evident that the City Council, while\r\ncomprising some good and capable men, was sadly misgoverning this\r\ncity, your Council, with representatives of other organizations,\r\nendeavoured to secure such amendment of the City Charter as\r\nwould provide for a reduction in the number of Aldermen and for\r\nthe election of a Board of Commissioners. This effort resulted\r\nsuccessfully in 1909, but unfortunately the amendments to the\r\nCharter submitted by the Citizens Committee were so changed\r\nin their passage through the Legislature that the Board of\r\nCommissioners did not possess the full powers it was intended to\r\ngive them, and the result has been that, while the Commissioners\r\nhave done much for the City, many of their plans for its\r\nadvantage have been frustrated by the City Council and hence the\r\nhope for improvement in the condition of the City has been only\r\npartially realized. Your Council, therefore, in October last,\r\njoined with the following other organizations in an endeavour\r\nto secure such further amendments to the City Charter as would\r\ngive the Board of Commissioners all executive powers, leaving\r\nwith the City Council the general legislative powers and the\r\nmaking of by-laws: Montreal Trades and Labour Council, Canadian\r\nManufacturers’ Association, La Chambre de Commerce, Montreal\r\nCitizens’ Association, Association Immobilière Montréal, Montreal\r\nBusiness Men’s League.\r\n\r\nThe substance of these amendments was as follows:\r\n\r\n“That the Commissioners shall prepare the annual budget and the\r\nsupplementary budget, and submit each to the City Council, which\r\nshall have the power to amend them by a two-thirds majority, or\r\nto reject them by a majority.\r\n\r\n“That in the event of the budget not being adopted, amended or\r\nrejected within a certain period, it would be considered adopted.\r\n\r\n“That once the budget is adopted, with or without amendment, the\r\nentire control of the expenditure, within the limits prescribed\r\nby the budget, would be left to the Board of Commissioners.\r\n\r\n“That the Board of Commissioners shall have the appointment,\r\nsuspension, dismissal and full control in all respects of all\r\nemployees, including the heads of departments.\r\n\r\n“That the initiative as to loans and franchises shall be with the\r\nBoard of Commissioners, subject to approval by the City Council,\r\nwho could amend or reject by a two-thirds majority.\r\n\r\n“That the general legislative power and the making of by-laws\r\nshall be with the City Council, but the Board of Commissioners\r\nshall have all executive powers.\r\n\r\n“That if any change in the composition of the City Council is\r\ndecided upon, it would best be obtained by dividing the city into\r\nfive wards (each to elect three aldermen), such division to be\r\nmade equitably in proportion to population, assessed value and\r\npossible growth.\r\n\r\n“Amendments to the City Charter Bill, based upon the foregoing,\r\nwere presented to the Private Bills Committee at Quebec by the\r\nCitizens Association, the Board of Trade and other leading\r\nassociations resulted in their adoption, with a slight change\r\nand thus the Board of Commissioners is now in possession of the\r\npowers necessary for the proper discharge of its duties.”\r\n\r\nIt is to be noted that, by a strange oversight of the framers\r\nof the amended charter, the following important clause in the\r\noriginal charter for the Board of Control was omitted: “To make\r\nall recommendations involving the expenditure of money. No\r\nrecommendation involving the expenditure of money, and affecting\r\nin any manner whatever the finances of the city shall be adopted\r\nby the Council without it having been previously submitted to the\r\nBoard of Commissioners and approved by them.” There was, however,\r\nadded the power to conclude without tender, urgent purchase of\r\nmaterials not exceeding the value of $2,500.\r\n\r\nThe elections of 1912, in which the four controllers, who had\r\ncompleted their term of four years, did not compete, resulted\r\nin the election of Mr. L.A. Lavallée, K.C., as the next mayor.\r\nAmong the new aldermen elected were several of those who had\r\nbeen scored in Judge Cannon’s report, so short-lived is a city’s\r\nremembrance. During the next two years the position of the Board\r\nof Control was further jeopardized by organized opposition from\r\nthe part of the council, but the evident value of the system\r\nstill retained the favour of the people.\r\n\r\nIn preparation for the campaign of 1914 the chief civic bodies of\r\nthe city called together by the Citizens Association sought to\r\ndiminish the number of the aldermen further by a redistribution\r\nof the city into five districts with three aldermen to each,\r\nwith the object of the abolition of the small ward system\r\nas such. An amendment to the charter was prepared for five\r\ndistricts with three aldermen to each, and presented to the\r\nlegislative committee of the Provincial Government at Quebec.\r\nIts delegation obtained a lukewarm reception as its opponents,\r\nwithin the Council, fearing to be reduced in number in the\r\ncity hall, had forestalled the deputation by previous action.\r\nIn addition it was thought that the redistribution demanded\r\nwas premature. The “status quo” therefore remained, and at the\r\nmunicipal elections of 1914 the organized reaction against\r\nthe Citizens Association leading the reform party was very\r\nclearly marked in the results of the poll. An attempt was made\r\nto vilify the Citizens Association for its efforts to provide\r\na harmonious “slate” representative of the different elements\r\nin the city; disorganization and want of cohesion reigned among\r\nthose otherwise interested in good government, and the unwritten\r\nlaw which should have offered the mayoralty this year to an\r\nEnglish-speaking citizen was broken.\r\n\r\nThis election was the most important of recent years, the\r\npositions of mayor, four controllers and thirty-two aldermen\r\nbeing vacant. The mayor elected was the Mr. Médéric Martin, the\r\ncontrollers being Mr. Joseph Ainey, E. Napoléon Hébert, Thomas\r\nCoté and Duncan McDonald. The personnel of the Council was\r\nlikewise overwhelmingly French Canadian.\r\n\r\nThis Government is now under trial. Let us repeat the city’s\r\nmotto “Concordia Salus.”\r\n\r\nThere are not wanting signs in forecast that the reduction of the\r\nnumber of wards will take place on the lines above indicated.\r\nMontreal civic students of this period, seeing the growth of the\r\nGreater Montreal, are groping towards some coherent system, which\r\nwill eventually embrace the whole island while securing the local\r\ngovernment of its various subdistricts or municipality. Another\r\nmovement of the future connected with the foregoing will be a\r\nlarger measure of Civic Home Rule, than is at present allowed by\r\nthe Province of Quebec.\r\n\r\nThe system of the financial government of the city by the Board\r\nof Control is not, however, universally approved of, especially\r\nby the aldermen. The fault lies in the manner of election of\r\nthe mayor, aldermen and the controllers, all being elected by\r\nthe people on a Democratic basis of public favour; hence there\r\nis likelihood of temporary popularity rather than special\r\nprofessional ability being the criterion in the selection of\r\ncontrollers and the mayor, who is, by his office, chairman of\r\ntheir board.\r\n\r\nThere are, therefore, at present several theories under\r\ndiscussion which will influence a further change of the latest\r\ncharter amendments.\r\n\r\nAmong these are the following:\r\n\r\n(1) The appointment by the Provincial Legislature of a Board\r\nof Control. This militates against the upholders of Civic Home\r\nRule and is a partial recurrence to the old system of Justices\r\nof the Peace, appointed by Government before the erection of the\r\nmunicipality.\r\n\r\n(2) The removal of the Board of Control and the restitution\r\nof the standing committees as hitherto. This has not proved\r\nsuccessful in the past.\r\n\r\n(3) The aldermen to be elected by the city at large through five\r\nor six great divisions.\r\n\r\n(4) The election of the councillors by the city at large with the\r\nestablishment of a permanent “Board of Works” with at least a\r\nfair proportion of professional men, such as engineers, who shall\r\nbe appointed by the people for a long term of usefulness so as\r\nto encourage the best men to devote a life service in the city’s\r\nemploy.\r\n\r\n(5) The mayor to be elected by the people but not to sit as\r\nchairman of the Board of Control. This Board to be elected only\r\nby the votes of the electors entered as “proprietors” on the\r\nvoters list. Thus, with property qualifications for controllers\r\nadded perhaps, a more judicious choice could be made. The\r\nelection of alderman to be as before or by larger divisions.\r\n\r\nOf these modifications the last compromise has more weight.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             NOTE 1\r\n\r\n                       MAYORS OF MONTREAL\r\n\r\n  Term.

Therefore, origins and seeds are\r\nonly indicated, of many movements which have since grown to great\r\nproportions. These latter, such as primary, secondary, technical,\r\nand university education, the public services of fire, water,\r\nlighting, health, law and order; the commencements of commercial\r\nand financial bodies; the growth of the municipal life, as such;\r\nthe development and modernization of the harbour and of our\r\npublic places; the progress of general city improvement; the\r\ndevelopment of our transportation system by canal, river and\r\nroads by rail and by carriage; the charitable, the religious,\r\nthe national, the literary, the intellectual and the artistic\r\ninstitutions of the city, etc., are left for special historical\r\ntreatment in the second part of this volume.\r\n\r\nIn this place the general social aspect of the life of the city\r\nis chronologically treated, with partial reference at times to\r\nthe above as they make their first bow to the public under the\r\nUnion. A similar foreword might preface a subsequent chapter of\r\nannals of social life under the Confederation.\r\n\r\nThe picture presented by Montreal at the beginning of the\r\nUnion was one of hopeful promise. The bill, when understood,\r\nwas acceptable to most, and it soon became seen, that with\r\nresponsible government,--though a daring experiment,--in working\r\norder, peace and prosperity would be assured. The re-birth of\r\nmunicipal life insured by the new charter was also gratifying.\r\nThe mayor and corporation and the institution of the recorder’s\r\ncourt gave a dignity soothing to civic “amour propre.” City\r\ndevelopment in municipal functions, in the public services and\r\nphysical embellishments, began to be marked. Trade began to raise\r\nits head, for Montreal was becoming recognized as the commercial\r\nmetropolis of Canada. The meeting of April 6, 1841, to organize\r\nthe new board of trade, was a significant fact of the period\r\nof progress now anticipated. The improvement in the harbour\r\nfacilities, of the water transportation system, and the advent of\r\nthe railway era soon to be celebrated, also marked the beginning\r\nof a new period of progress.\r\n\r\nThe city, too, was coming to be recognized as an embryonic\r\ncosmopolis. It was already beginning to have a mixed population.\r\nSir Richard Bonnycastle, who visited Montreal in the year before\r\nthe Union, has described this in “The Canadas in 1841” (Volume\r\nI, pp. 76-77). “In this city, one is amused by seeing the never\r\nchanging lineaments of the long _queue_, the _bonnet rouge_ and\r\nthe incessant garrulity of Jean Baptiste, mingling with the\r\nsober demeanour, the equally unchanging feature and the national\r\nplaid of the Highlander, while the untutored sons of labour,\r\nfrom the green isle of the ocean, are here as thoughtless, as\r\nragged and as numerous as at Quebec. Amongst all these the shrewd\r\nand calculating citizen from the neighbouring republic drives\r\nhis hard bargain with all his wonted zeal and industry, amid\r\nthe fumes of Jamaica and gin sling. These remarks apply to the\r\nstreets only. In the counting houses, although the races remain\r\nthe same, the advantages of situation and of education make the\r\nsame differences as in other countries. I cannot, however, help\r\nthinking that the descendant of the Gaul has not gained by being\r\ntransplanted; and the vastly absurd notions which a few turbulent\r\nspirits have of late engendered and endeavoured to instil into\r\nthe unsophisticated and naturally good mind of the Canadian,\r\ntilling the soil, have tended to restrict the exercise of that\r\ninborn urbanity and suavity which are the Frenchman’s proudest\r\nboast after those of ‘_l’amour et la gloire_.’”\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of this period great ideas are reflected in the\r\nnewspapers, such as the Herald and the Times.\r\n\r\nThe deepening of Lake St. Peter was a burning theme at the time;\r\nand there is abundant editorial comment in the connection.\r\n\r\n  “The governor-general has sanctioned the immediate deepening of\r\n  Lake St. Peter,” says the editor; “but it appears that there\r\n  was great difficulty in getting the proper dredging machines\r\n  manufactured.”\r\n\r\n  “We have other resources at our command,” exclaimed the editor;\r\n  “and the manufacturers of New York or Great Britain would gladly\r\n  accept orders to any extent. The aid of steam, all powerful\r\n  steam, must be invoked. We have no hesitation in saying that the\r\n  expenditure of £100,000, if that sum would suffice to deepen Lake\r\n  St. Peter, would be submitted to with perfect prudence.\r\n\r\n  “Few will be dogmatical enough to deny that when the navigation\r\n  is free, ships descending the river may avoid the use of steam\r\n  tugs; and if we calculate the saving thus effected upon 200\r\n  vessels annually at £30 each, the amount thus realized would\r\n  suffice to pay the interest on a loan at 6 per cent.\r\n\r\n  “A brisk, fair, and continuous breeze would ensure the speedy,\r\n  safe and cheap progress of ships up the St. Lawrence, and augment\r\n  the extent of our commercial marine.”\r\n\r\nReferring, in another part of the paper, to the actual\r\ncommencement of the work of deepening Lake St. Peter, which only\r\ngave eleven feet of water, the Times says:\r\n\r\n  “Improvements thus disseminating the germs of future wealth and\r\n  prosperity command the applause of every colonist. The spirit of\r\n  patriotism must be dormant, indeed, in the breasts of those who\r\n  would thwart the efforts of a governor, who has thus identified\r\n  himself with the system of internal navigation.\r\n\r\n  “The repose of the colony has been too long disturbed by those\r\n  theoretical revolutions which sprang from the fluctuating\r\n  councils of the late Viceroy. A healthier tone of feeling has\r\n  been produced; and the practical labours of Sir Charles Bagot bid\r\n  fair to soothe the asperities of political warfare. Under his\r\n  auspices the deepening of Lake St. Peter has been commenced and\r\n  ere his departure, we trust the undertaking will be brought to\r\n  maturity.”\r\n\r\nSince then something in the neighborhood of $20,000,000 have been\r\nspent between the work of deepening and lighting and buoying\r\nthe channel, and the extension and improvement of the port of\r\nMontreal.\r\n\r\nThe editors of these days had to burn the midnight oil or tallow\r\ncandle, for then gas was not general. As for matches, the old\r\ntinder chips dipped in sulphur ind ignited by use of the flint\r\nstill prevailed. The rich used wax candles or lamps, but the poor\r\nmade their own “dips,” or for the nonce, even small improvised\r\nlamps out of spoons filled with oil. Tallow candle moulds were\r\nthe prized possession of many poor houses before the manufactured\r\ncandles became cheap on the market. When coal oil came, it was\r\nlooked on as a miracle.\r\n\r\nThe town was inadequately provided with water works, as it was\r\nnot till 1845 that the municipality took over the old-fashioned\r\nplant in Montreal, and the old puncheons, driven by horses still\r\nwent from door to door distributing the water taken from the\r\nriver.\r\n\r\nPlace d’Armes was still a poor straggling square, though it was\r\nfaced by the handsome new Notre Dame Church, opened in 1829. At\r\nthis time there still stood the bell tower of the old Parish\r\nChurch, standing solitary like a lighthouse till 1843. Crossing\r\nthe square the genteel folk, the wives of doctors, lawyers, and\r\nmerchants, would come from their residences on St. James and\r\nCraig streets to the Bonsecours Market, not ashamed to carry\r\ntheir baskets. There the “habitants” from the country could be\r\nseen dressed in blue or gray homespun cloth suits, with their\r\npicturesque, heavy knitted sashes and wearing the tuque and\r\nmoccasins in winter.\r\n\r\nFor as yet, the city was in truth of small size. A four-paged,\r\ndemi-zinc copy of the Times and Commercial Advertiser, the first\r\ndaily to be printed in Montreal, of the issue of March 3, 1842,\r\ngives a glimpse of this. An advertisement announces that a\r\nthree-storey stone house at the head of Coté Street, “enjoys a\r\ncommanding situation in a most quiet and healthy part of Montreal\r\nand which nevertheless is within five minutes walk of the\r\nbusiness part of the city.” Splendid dwelling houses are for rent\r\non Great St. James Street suitable for genteel families.\r\n\r\nYet life was intense and earnest and the bases of many of the\r\npresent educational, philanthropic and artistic associations were\r\nbeing laid. This same number of the Times mentions that the\r\n\r\n  “The Montreal Provident and Savings Bank, which has just been\r\n  projected, under the patronage of the governor-general, and which\r\n  is to receive deposits of from one shilling and upwards, is a\r\n  patriotic institution, as the directors and all concerned have\r\n  only the advantage of the entire community at heart, receiving\r\n  nothing for their services, and desiring, chiefly, to extend,\r\n  by this means, the basis of social order and morality, and\r\n  religion. For these reasons the directors respectfully entreat\r\n  the ministers of religion, masters employing numerous bodies\r\n  of workmen, and all having influence, to exert the same; and\r\n  by the sanction of their names, and the moral weight of their\r\n  advice, to induce the numerous classes, for whose use it is\r\n  chiefly intended, to avail themselves of the benefits which the\r\n  institution holds out for their acceptance.”\r\n\r\nLiving was cheap and quite a good deal could be bought with\r\nbut a little money. Money, however, was scarce and wages were\r\nsmall. Twenty-five cents would buy a pair of chickens, 15 cents\r\na pound of butter, 10 cents a dozen eggs and 5 cents a pound of\r\nbeef. A man would work for 50 cents a day and walk many miles to\r\nhis job. A mechanic who got $1, earned good wages. Clothing was\r\nexpensive, and consequently simplicity ruled. Yet furs were cheap\r\nin comparison with the present date. Ladies would wear very large\r\nmuffs, capable of holding in their mysterious interiors a week’s\r\nsupply of groceries. Long boas were worn twice wound around the\r\nneck, and reaching to the toes. The dresses of the middle class\r\nof women and girls were for the most part print, with thick\r\nhomespun for winter wear. Boys would go to the few schools in the\r\ntown in “moleskins” as woolen was expensive. They would often\r\ncome home on a rainy afternoon with their moleskin trousers\r\nshrunk up to their knees.\r\n\r\nThe houses of the ordinary working class were built for the most\r\npart of wood and consisted of one storey and a garret. Rents ran\r\nfrom about two dollars to four dollars a month.\r\n\r\nIn 1843 a dispensary which is still flourishing today was started\r\nand came as a great supplementary aid to the hospitals of the\r\ncity. This was the Montreal Dispensary with which so many of our\r\nbest citizens have been connected.\r\n\r\nThe memory of Rasco’s suggests that of the famous “Dolly,”\r\nJ.H. Isaacson, who came out from England as a waiter here in\r\n1838, but afterwards started for himself in a restaurant on St.\r\nFrançois Xavier Street overlooking the Garden of the Seminary.\r\nHe later moved to St. James Street, close to St. Lawrence Hall,\r\na famous hostelry of this period, built in 1851, on the site\r\nwhere the Royal Bank now stands. His chop house became famous\r\nas “Dolly’s” from the original “Dolly’s” in London. Dolly, a\r\nlittle typical old John Bull of a Boniface, with shining face\r\nbeaming benevolence, with a ready fund of repartee and trenchant\r\ncriticism, and resplendent in velvet coat, knee breeches and\r\nirreproachable calves, white silk stockings and silver buckles on\r\nhis shoes, was in great favour with the military.\r\n\r\nThe social life of the period found one of its highest points\r\nof reflex in Rasco’s Hotel, on Bonsecours Street, which still\r\nstands, though with diminished glory. But when it was opened on\r\nMay 1, 1836, it was, during the Union, the resort of the fine\r\npeople of the time. It had the politicians gathered together\r\nduring the rebellion of 1837 and it was for long the home for\r\nbanquets. It expressed the social life of the time. The garrison\r\nofficers knew it well. Distinguished strangers put up there\r\nas did Charles Dickens, who arrived from Niagara Falls in the\r\nspring of 1842. As private theatricals were then the rage, and\r\nwere greatly promoted by the officers to while away the time,\r\nthe histrionic ability of the great novelist was called into\r\nrequisition at the first Theatre Royal, standing nearly opposite\r\nuntil it was pulled down to make room for the Bonsecours Market.\r\n\r\nIn one of the author’s letters from Montreal quoted in Forster’s\r\n“Life of Charles Dickens,” he says: “The theatricals, I think\r\nI told you I had been invited to play with the officers of the\r\nColdstream Guards here, are ‘A Roland for an Oliver,’ ‘Two\r\nO’Clock in the Morning,’ and either ‘The Young Widow,’ or ‘Deaf\r\nas a Post,’ Ladies (unprofessional) are going to play for the\r\nfirst time.”\r\n\r\nHis last letter, dated from Rasco’s Hotel, Montreal, Canada, 26th\r\nof May, 1842, described the private theatricals and inclosed a\r\nbill of the play:\r\n\r\n“The play came off last night, the audience, between five and\r\nsix hundred strong, were invited as to a party, a regular table\r\nwith refreshments being spread in the lobby and saloon. We had\r\nthe band of the 23d (one of the finest in the service) in the\r\norchestra; the theatre was lighted with gas, the scenery was\r\nexcellent and the properties were all brought from the private\r\nhouses. Sir Charles Bagot, Sir Richard Jackson and their staffs\r\nwere present, and as the military portion of the audience were\r\nall in uniform it was really a splendid scene.\r\n\r\n“I really believe I was really funny; at least, I know that I\r\nlaughed heartily myself and made the part a character such as you\r\nand I know very well--a mixture of F. Harley Yates, Keeley and\r\n‘Jerry Sneak.’ It went with a vim all the way through; and as I\r\nam closing, they have told me that I was so well made up that Sir\r\nCharles Bagot, who sat in the stage box, had no idea who played\r\n‘Mr. Snobbington’ until the piece was over. * * *\r\n\r\n“All the ladies were capital and we had no wait or hitch for\r\nan instant.

He notes\r\nthe modernizing spirit even of that day. “There is a very large\r\ncathedral here, recently erected with two small spires, of\r\nwhich one is as yet unfinished. In the open space in front of\r\nthis edifice stands a solitary, grim-looking square brick tower\r\nwhich has a quaint and remarkable appearance and which the\r\nwiseacres of this place have consequently determined to pull down\r\nimmediately.” This the vandals did in 1843.\r\n\r\nWalking along the quays he admired “the granite quays” which are\r\nremarkable for their beauty, solidity and extent. Referring to\r\nhis walk here and his interest in the immigrants, he says: “In\r\nthe spring time of the year vast numbers of emigrants who have\r\nnewly arrived from England or from Ireland pass between Quebec\r\nand Montreal on their way to the back woods and new settlements\r\nof Canada. If it be an entertaining lounge, as I have found it,\r\nto take a morning stroll upon the quays of Montreal and see the\r\ngroups in hundreds on the public wharfs about their chests and\r\nboxes, it is matter of deep interest to be their fellow passenger\r\non one of these steamboats and, mingling with the concourse, see\r\nand hear them unobserved.”\r\n\r\nThen follows a characteristic digression of the Master’s\r\nsympathetic pleading for the poor.\r\n\r\nAt the above meeting places the events of the day would have\r\nbeen discussed by the gossips, such as the marriage of Queen\r\nVictoria on February 10, 1840, the shooting at of the young\r\nQueen Victoria and Prince Albert on June 10, 1841, Her Majesty’s\r\ncoronation of June 28th, the birth of Albert Edward, Prince of\r\nWales, on November 9th, and the progress of preparations for the\r\nunion proclaimed on February 10th in Montreal by Lord Sydenham.\r\nMunicipal politics would have become an absorbing topic of\r\nconversation on January 1, 1842, when the municipal act went\r\ninto force. On March 11th when the Montreal Board of Trade was\r\nincorporated, and on July 9th when the Shamrock was lost in\r\nthe St. Lawrence, with its many immigrants there was plenty to\r\ndiscuss. Montreal, in 1843, talked of the birth of Princess Alice\r\non April 25th, the visit to Montreal of the new governor general,\r\nLord Metcalfe, on June 12th, while the “Nolle Sequi” against\r\nWolfred Nelson, Dr. E.B. O’Callaghan and T.S. Brown renewed the\r\npainful memories of the revolt of 1837. This year the scientists\r\nand educationalists rejoiced at the Museum of Geological Survey\r\nthen opened in the city. And again when, in 1844, the Mercantile\r\nLibrary Association purchased the Montreal Library and the\r\nInstitut Canadien was formed.\r\n\r\nGreat interest prevailed in political circles when the seat of\r\ngovernment was removed to Montreal on March 5th of this year, and\r\nthe House met on July 1st.\r\n\r\nOn November 12th, such an election was held that many of the\r\noldest inhabitants remember it still. It was the days of open\r\nvoting and sometimes lasted for weeks. Axe handles were used,\r\nheads were broken, the “claret” flowed, and the opposing\r\nparties used to keep men drunk in the taverns so that the\r\nother side could not get their men to the polls. Such scenes\r\nwere long repeated, notably in the “Barney” Devlin and D’Arcy\r\nMcGee election contests. The fight on this occasion was between\r\nDrummond and Molson. Drummond was Irish and it was recalled that\r\nhe had been the defending lawyer for the rebels in 1837. The\r\nFrench-Canadians, therefore, rallied to his support and Molson\r\nwas beaten. Parliament met on November 28th.\r\n\r\nOn March 27, 1845, Parliament was prorogued and on July 1st\r\nthe new governor, Lord Cathcart, arrived. This year various\r\neducational movements were furthered. Bishop’s College,\r\nLennoxville, was opened and the Mechanics’ Institute, so long\r\nin existence as an educational force, was incorporated. In\r\nDecember, John Dougall issued his specimen Witness and the first\r\nweekly Witness was published on January 5, 1846. Meanwhile the\r\ncommission appointed in 1845 to investigate the rebellion losses\r\nindemnities was sitting and on April 18, 1846, it presented\r\nits report that the sum of £100,000 would be sufficient to\r\npay all real losses. Already bitter feeling was being aroused\r\namong the English on this point. But the railway era, then\r\ncommencing, diverted some attention from their grievances. In\r\nJune, James Ferrier and others sought a charter for a railway\r\nfrom Kingston to Prescott and John A. Macdonald, then beginning\r\nhis parliamentary career, and others, sought one from Montreal to\r\nKingston, John Molson and others demanding one from St. Johns to\r\nthe international boundary. On August 10th, on the Champ de Mars,\r\na gathering of 2,000 Montrealers resolved to have a railway to\r\nthe sea. Men were seeing visions and the Hon. John Young wrote\r\nthis year to the Economist, advocating a bridge across the St.\r\nLawrence. His dream was to come true.\r\n\r\nThe year 1847 saw the line from Montreal to Lachine opened.\r\nOtherwise the year was one of disaster--that of the ship fever.\r\nIn this year 100,000 emigrants, mostly from Ireland, escaping the\r\nscourge of typhus fever and famine, came to Canada, but being\r\nexposed to ship fever nearly 10,000 became its victims; hundreds\r\nand hundreds died. The quarantine station of Grosse Isle was the\r\nmost pestilential spot in the country. Every ship that could be\r\nchartered, good, bad and indifferent, was engaged in transporting\r\nemigrants. They were all slow-going vessels. Through want of\r\nsufficient room, neglect of ventilation, need of eatable food and\r\ncleanliness, the worst form of typhus soon appeared. “On the 8th\r\nday of May,” says Maguire’s “Irish in America,” “on the arrival\r\nof the ‘Urania’ from Cork, with several hundred immigrants on\r\nboard, a large proportion of them sick and dying of the ship\r\nfever, it was put into quarantine at Grosse Isle, thirty miles\r\nbelow Quebec. This was the first of the plague-smitten ships from\r\nIreland which that year sailed up the St. Lawrence. But before\r\nthe first week of June as many as eighty-four ships of various\r\ntonnage were driven in by easterly gales. Of all the vessels\r\nthere was not one free from the taint of malignant typhus, the\r\noffspring of famine and of the foul ship-hold.”\r\n\r\nMontreal suffered terribly, also. There the Government caused to\r\nbe erected three sheds of provisory hospitals from 100 to 150\r\nfeet in length and from 40 to 50 feet in width on the river banks\r\nat Point St. Charles. Soon eleven sheds had to be erected to\r\nreceive the sick. In June, the city was in consternation and many\r\nfled to the country. But there were many who did noble service.\r\nThe governor general, Lord Elgin, who had made his first coming\r\nto Montreal on January 29th, visited the sheds; the mayor, John\r\nE. Mills, also made frequent visits and in November his assiduous\r\ndevotion brought him low in death, a martyr to civic duty. The\r\nclergy, the doctors and the women of the city, Catholic and\r\nProtestants, were heroic in their services. The priests hurried\r\ndown to the sick who were mostly Catholics, but only a few,\r\ntwo Sulpicians and a Jesuit, du Ranquet, could speak English\r\nadequately. In this extremity the rector of the Jesuits, who had\r\nreturned to the city since 1842, sent to Fordham University,\r\nand two priests, Fathers du Merle and Michael Driscoll, were\r\nsent to assist Father du Ranquet, who was the first of the\r\nMontreal priests on the ground. This devoted man found the sick\r\nor dead lying in rows stretched on the bare ground, and there he\r\nministered till 3 o’clock in the morning.\r\n\r\nConditions were soon improved by the municipal authorities.\r\nWooden bunks were built to hold two patients; there were no\r\nmattresses but only straw strewn under them. Oftentimes the\r\nliving lay side by side with the dead. To add to the horror, the\r\nletters of this period tell us that “after a few weeks’ service\r\nthese wooden structures contained colonies of bugs in every\r\ncranny; the wool, the cotton, the wood were black with them.\r\nDouble the number of nurses and servants would not have sufficed\r\nto keep this monstrous hospital clean.”\r\n\r\nThings were better when the tents to be given to those who,\r\nunable to find shelter in the sheds, were placed on the banks\r\nof the St. Lawrence with a blanket over them, under the trees.\r\nFortunately it was summertime.\r\n\r\nBishop Bourget called upon the nuns to act as nurses. The\r\nProvidence Sisters were the first approached, on June 24th. Each\r\none answered simply, “I am ready.” Next morning twelve of these\r\nbrave women were driven in carriages to the sheds. There they\r\nfound hundreds of the sick crouched upon straw, wrestling in the\r\nagony of death; little children weeping in the arms of their\r\ndead mothers; women, themselves stricken, seeking for a beloved\r\nhusband, amid a doleful chaos of suffering and evil odours. Other\r\nnuns were called out; even the enclosed Sisters of the Hôtel Dieu\r\nwere allowed to leave their cloisters for the sad work of tending\r\nthe dying and burying the dead in their hastily constructed, rude\r\ncoffins of planks. Fifty or sixty died each day and their bodies,\r\nawaiting burial, were placed in an immense charnel house erected\r\non the river banks. In this were some that were buried alive.\r\nMany of the orphans were adopted in the city or cared for by the\r\nnuns. For this the Irish population of Montreal love the city\r\nwith a personal love.\r\n\r\nNot only did the mayor die, but numerous others, physicians,\r\nclergy and nurses, and the police officers of the city.\r\n\r\nThe events of 1848 include the flooding, on January 15th, of\r\nWellington and Commissioners streets, and the run on the Savings\r\nBank of the city on July 15th, which was shortly followed by a\r\nre-deposit. Educationalists will note the opening of the Jesuits’\r\nCollege on September 20th in the improvised school at the corner\r\nof Alexander and Dorchester streets.\r\n\r\nThe year 1849 was one of political turmoil already recorded,\r\ncentering around the rebellion losses bill and resulting in the\r\nburning of the Parliament house and the removal of the seat of\r\ngovernment from the city, a loss to its social life.\r\n\r\nAn aspect of the burning of the Parliament house was that, with\r\nthe political rancour there was mixed, in certain misguided\r\nquarters, a fanatical religious frenzy. It was planned to burn\r\nthe “Grey Nuns,” near at hand, as well as the Jesuits’ residence\r\nand St. Patrick’s Church. The menaces came to nothing, owing\r\nto the guards of Irish watchers. Yet at the time, according to\r\na letter written from Montreal in August, 1849, by the Jesuit\r\nFather Havequez to a friend in France, the Grey Nuns hard by were\r\nlikely to become a prey to the fire “had not the brave Irish run\r\nto the rescue and succeeded, after extraordinary efforts, in\r\nmastering the flames.”\r\n\r\nThe imposing public ceremony this year was the funeral, in the\r\nmilitary cemetery on Papineau Road, of Sir Benjamin D’Urban, from\r\nwhom Durban, in South Africa, bears its name, the charger of the\r\ndeceased soldier being led through the streets in the procession\r\nby the groom, carrying the reversed boots of this companion of\r\nWellington. It was long a remembered incident.\r\n\r\nThe next year, 1850, saw the first meeting of the Mount Royal\r\nCemetery Company for the burial of non-Catholics and the\r\nconsecration of the Rev. Francis Fulford in Westminster Abbey as\r\nthe first Bishop of Montreal, both signs of the growth of the\r\nEnglish-speaking population.\r\n\r\nThis year there was a great charity ball and it is interesting\r\nto note that among the subscribers to this ball were the Earl\r\nand Countess of Errol; Sir George and Lady Simpson (who lived\r\nat Lachine in a big stone mansion, standing on the present site\r\nof the Lachine Convent); the Chief Justice and Madame Rolland,\r\nSir James and Lady Alexander, Colonel and Mrs. Dyley, Honorable\r\nMr. and Mrs. Moffatt, Honorable Mr. Justice and Madame Mondelet,\r\nHonorable Mr. and Mrs. Drummond, Madame Rochblave, Mr. and Mrs.\r\nJohn Molson, the Commissary General and Mrs. Filder, Honorable\r\nMr. and Madame Rolland, Mr. and Madame de Beaujeau, Honorable\r\nMr. Justice and Mrs. Smith, Mr. Sheriff and Mrs. Coffin, Mr. and\r\nMrs. Ogilvy Moffatt, Captain and Mrs. Claremont, Major and Mrs.\r\nMacDougall, Lieut.-Col. Sir Howard Dalrymple, Honorable McCall,\r\nMajor Chester, Major Colley, Mr. and Mrs. Collingwood, Mr. Arthur\r\nMondelet, Mr. Arthur Lamothe and many others.\r\n\r\nThe band of the Nineteenth Regiment also attended by kind\r\npermission of Lieutenant-Colonel Hay.\r\n\r\nThe Grand Trunk was formed in 1851. The name of the incorporators\r\nwhich follow are also those of familiar families in the city of\r\ntoday: Thomas Allan Stayber, William Collins Meredith, Sir George\r\nSimpson, William Macdonald, David Davidson, J.G. McTavish, N.\r\nFinlayson, John Rawand, Edward B. Wilgress, John Boston, Theodore\r\nHart, T. McCullough, John Matthewson, John M. Tobin, E.H. Mount,\r\nWilkinson John Torrance, Isaac Gibb, Donald P. Ross, Robert\r\nMorris, James Henderson, Aaron H. David, John Ostell, J.H. Birss,\r\nWilliam Lunn, Dougall Stewart, C. Wilgress, William Molson, W.S.\r\nMcFarlane, A. Dow, John Lavanston, Peter McKenzie, D. McKenzie,\r\nJohn McKenzie, Hector McKenzie, William Foster Coffin, Hon. James\r\nFerrier, William Molson, George Crawford, Duncan Finlayson,\r\nJohn Silveright, John Ballenden, Allen Macdonnell, Samuel Gall,\r\nBenjamin Hart, John Carter, Andrew Cowan, Walter Benny, John\r\nH.

Watson, and William Cunningham.\r\n\r\nEducational movement also began to gain strength in 1851. The\r\nCollege Ste. Marie on Bleury Street the Young Men’s Christian\r\nAssociation and the new Theatre Royal were opened, while this\r\nyear the first external signs of the modern movement for woman’s\r\nemancipation was strikingly illustrated in July in the streets\r\nof Montreal by the appearance for the first time of the “bloomer\r\ncostume,” made famous at the time by the cartoons of Punch.\r\n\r\nTimes of commercial prosperity seemed now promised.\r\n\r\nThe next year, 1852, McGill received its new lease of life,\r\nobtaining its new charter, and from this date its success was\r\nassured.\r\n\r\nThe great fire of 1852 started on July 8th; it is said to have\r\nburnt 11,000 houses, while thousands were rendered homeless.\r\nMoney, however, was not scarce, for this year in December £5,000\r\nwas raised by merchants for a Merchants’ Exchange. Another\r\nfinancial sidelight is that in October of this year the Bank\r\nof Montreal issued its first notes like those of the Bank of\r\nEngland, the denominations being water-marked.\r\n\r\nThe Gavazzi riot, already described, with the investigations into\r\nits cause, was the social excitement for the year 1853, as well\r\nas the preparations for the Atlantic service between Montreal and\r\nEngland, secured by the first charter of May 23d.\r\n\r\nOn July 22d Pier No. 1 of the Victoria Bridge was begun, and on\r\nAugust 24th Lake St. Peter was deepened four feet, two inches.\r\nOn July 20th of the next year, 1854, the first stone of the\r\nVictoria Bridge was laid and on August 2d the first cofferdam was\r\nready for masonry. On October 11th the St. Lawrence and Atlantic\r\nRailway was opened from Longueuil to Richmond. These facts\r\nillustrate the early movement of the era of progress by land and\r\nwater, then beginning.\r\n\r\nAmong other events of this year it was announced that accounts\r\ncould be kept from September 1st to the end of the year, either\r\nin pounds, shillings, or pence, or in dollars and cents, the\r\ndecimal currency being expected to be generally in use by\r\nJanuary 1st following. Money order offices were first opened on\r\nDecember 1st; reciprocity was established between Canada and\r\nthe United States; the seigneurial tenure was abolished and the\r\nsecularization of clergy reserves was brought about.\r\n\r\nThe year 1854 was memorable as that of the Crimean War, when the\r\nEnglish and French were allied against the Russians. In 1914\r\nall three are allied against a common foe. The social life was\r\ninvaded by the spirit of patriotism. An appropriation of £20,000\r\nsterling was made by the Canadian Government “in favour of the\r\nwidows and orphans of England and France.” It was the gift of\r\nthe people of both French and English descent and the Emperor of\r\nthe French, in acknowledging the gift, commented on the union of\r\nraces it implied. A patriotic fund was organized in Montreal by\r\nconcerts and other forms of charity as in 1914.\r\n\r\nThe year 1854 is also sadly memorable by the Asiatic cholera\r\nwhich carried off 1,186 persons.\r\n\r\nAfter the commercial depression of 1854, due to the Crimean War,\r\nthe spring of 1855 saw brighter prosperity.\r\n\r\nThe annals of this year record as signs of general progress the\r\nfirst issue, in February, of money orders in Canada, the coming\r\ninto force of the reciprocity act with the United States, the\r\nestablishment by the H. & A. Allan Company of the Montreal Ocean\r\nSteamship Company with four steamers fortnightly, the completion\r\nof the general postoffice, the new building of the Mechanics’\r\nInstitute, the incorporation of Molson’s bank, and the opening of\r\na new industry through the completion of Redpath’s sugar refinery.\r\n\r\nIn March the Industrial Exhibition, promoted to select articles\r\nto be sent to the coming Paris Exhibition was formally opened by\r\nthe governor general, Sir Edmund Head, who made his first visit\r\nto Montreal on this occasion.\r\n\r\nOn July 27th the first French ship to sail the St. Lawrence\r\nsince the conquest reached Montreal under Commander de Belvèze.\r\nThe object was to obtain information to extend the commercial\r\nrelations between Canada and France. The occasion, coming so\r\nsoon after the fall of Sebastopol, was one of great public\r\ndemonstration, illuminations and torchlight processions, the like\r\nof which the city had never yet beheld. The arrival of Admiral\r\nBelvèze’s warship, with dinners and receptions, especially among\r\nthe French citizens, also made 1855 a memorable social year.\r\n\r\nIn 1856 Montreal was filled with preparations for the great Paris\r\nExhibition and Alfred Perry was voted £500 to represent Montreal.\r\nIt is remembered that at this exhibition he had a fire fighting\r\ninvention on show which was lucky enough to be in readiness to\r\nstop a conflagration in the exhibition, a fact largely noticed\r\nin the continental papers and illustrated journals. A balloon\r\nascension on September 16th in Griffintown, in the “Canada,” is\r\nseriously chronicled by the annalists as a striking novelty of\r\nthe year.\r\n\r\nOn June 11, 1856, thirty-five lives were lost in the Grand Trunk\r\nferry boat to Longueuil by the explosion of the boiler, through\r\nthe carelessness of the engineer. The burning of the steamer\r\nMontreal off Quebec on June 27, 1857, which was carrying to\r\nMontreal about five hundred emigrants who had just arrived from\r\nthe John McKenzie, caused great excitement in the city and was\r\nthe occasion of much hospitality. As the immigrants it carried\r\nwere mostly Scotch, the activities of St. Andrew’s National\r\nSociety were largely engaged.\r\n\r\nOn June 18, 1856, the Thirty-ninth Regiment which had fought in\r\nthe Crimea reached Montreal transported by the John Munn and\r\nQuebec. A civic dinner closed the day in the City Concert Hall\r\nwith covers laid for 1,200 guests.\r\n\r\nThe 12th and 13th of November saw the city again en fète to\r\ncelebrate the opening of the Grand Trunk between Toronto and\r\nMontreal, which terminated on the 12th in a banquet at Point St.\r\nCharles with 4,000 present. The evening of the 13th closed with a\r\npromenade through the brilliantly illuminated city with the roar\r\nof cannon at intervals and a great ball.\r\n\r\nOn November 5th a violent hurricane swept over Montreal and on\r\nDecember 10th Christ Church Cathedral was burnt down.\r\n\r\nThis year the additions and new works of Montreal waterworks were\r\nbeing made ready for use.\r\n\r\nThe cause of science received a great impetus in the city by the\r\nconvention which started on Wednesday, August 12, 1857, of the\r\nAmerican Association for the Advancement of Science, and was\r\ncontinued for a week, during which the University of McGill,\r\nthe Natural History Society and other learned organizations\r\nentertained their distinguished guests. In September of the same\r\nyear the Agricultural and Industrial Exhibition was successfully\r\nheld.\r\n\r\nOn September 7th 500 of the Thirty-ninth Regiment left Montreal\r\nfor active service, for this was the year of the Indian mutiny.\r\n\r\nEducational circles remember the year of the meeting in Montreal\r\nof the American Association for the Advancement of Learning\r\nand as the opening of the Jacques Cartier and the McGill\r\nNormal schools for teachers. This was practically the earliest\r\nconverging point of the two boards of school commissioners in the\r\nbuilding up of their educational system.\r\n\r\nJanuary 1, 1858, marks the supplanting of the L.S.D. system by\r\nthe decimal coinage; January 5th, the purchase of the Montreal\r\nand Bytown (Ottawa) Railway for £5,300 by Mr. (afterward Sir\r\nJohn) J.J.C. Abbott.\r\n\r\nOn February 26th, Griffintown was flooded and beds stood three\r\nfeet in water, being one of the annual spring floods.\r\n\r\nThe martial enthusiasm of the citizens was evoked in the city in\r\nthe early part of 1858 by the Indian mutiny, when the Imperial\r\nGovernment accepted the offer of a regiment to be raised in\r\nCanada for service abroad under the title of the “One Hundredth\r\nPrince of Wales Royal Canadian Regiment.” The recruiting\r\nsergeant, with his flying ribbons, fife and drum band and his cry\r\nof “Come, boys, and join the war,” was a novelty then. Montreal\r\ncontributed for the first overseas contingent 110 young men, who\r\ndrilled with the detachment of 500 men on St. Helen’s Island\r\nprevious to being embarked for England in July following. This\r\nwas the first contingent raised for the front, but it did not\r\nget as far as India, doing duty at Malta and Gibraltar. None the\r\nless, as the old ballad says, “Their will was good to do the\r\ndeed, that is if they’d have let ’em, with a ‘Re fol de roy,\r\netc.’”\r\n\r\nOn September 1st the laying of the first Atlantic telegraph cable\r\nwas celebrated in the city by trades, military and torchlight\r\nprocessions, the latter being two miles long on the average of\r\nsix abreast. A bonfire on the mountain signalized this occasion.\r\n\r\nNext year, 1859, the Prince of Wales presented the One Hundredth\r\nRegiment with its colours at Shorncliffe.\r\n\r\nOn December 12th, the Victoria Bridge was at last opened and on\r\nthe 17th the first passenger train went through. It was called\r\nthe “Victoria” after the revered Queen of that name and it was\r\nhoped to have had Her Majesty formally open it.\r\n\r\nBefore leaving the construction works the men engaged placed the\r\ngreat boulder over the resting place of the many victims of the\r\nship fever of 1847. The words of a Montreal lady, Mrs. Leprohon,\r\ncommemorate the event thus:\r\n\r\n    “Long since forgotten, here they rest,\r\n    Sons of a distant shore\r\n    The epoch of their short career\r\n    These footprints on life’s sand,\r\n    But this stone will tell through many a year\r\n    They died on our shores and slumber here.”\r\n\r\nThis year Mr. Charles S. Rodier was mayor. A picture worth\r\npreserving has lately been given of the city hall life of that\r\ntime. The city was then very small and the questions were\r\ncomparatively parochial and the revenue was negligible in\r\ncomparison with today’s, yet the meetings were very important\r\nand very dignified and probably more eloquence flowed than now.\r\nThe English were then predominant and Mr. Rodden was the leader\r\nof the council. The mayor, Mr. Rodier, was, as a contemporary\r\nhas recently described him, “a man of much eccentricity, but a\r\nman also of education and ability. He was what you might call\r\nan aesthete--well groomed, neat, and polished, to the finger\r\nnails; always with his frock coat and silk hat; always ready to\r\nmake a sweeping bow; always on the watch to assist a lady from\r\nher carriage--a lady who might be shopping on Notre Dame Street,\r\nwhich was the great retail street of the city in my young days.\r\nIt didn’t matter that His Worship was not always acquainted with\r\nthe ladies; he was naturally a gallant and, anyway, there was\r\nless formality in those days than now.”\r\n\r\nAs he was the first mayor to receive royalty this description\r\nwill serve as an introduction. Mr. Rodier’s home was at the\r\ncorner of Guy and St. Antoine streets and was afterward purchased\r\nby the Dominion Immigration Agency for its offices.\r\n\r\nThe next great social event was the reception of Albert Edward,\r\nPrince of Wales, afterwards Edward VII, the Peacemaker, and the\r\npreparation of the exhibition which was to be opened by him,\r\nboth in connection with the formal opening of the great Victoria\r\nBridge, marking the era of railways now prevailing.\r\n\r\nIn preparation for this event the Board of Arts and Manufactures,\r\nin March, 1860, decided upon and took immediate steps for the\r\nerection of a Crystal Palace for a permanent exhibition on\r\nland purchased by them on Peel Street, above St. Catherine\r\nStreet. On Tuesday, May 22d, a public meeting was held to form\r\nthe “reception committee fund.” A programme of festivities\r\nand functions was drawn up in June. Triumphal arches and\r\nilluminations were prepared, the house of the Hon. John Rose,\r\nafterward owned by the Ogilvie family, was decorated for the stay\r\nof the young prince therein and on Friday, August 24th, the royal\r\nvisitor, described as a Prince of Romance, under the escort of\r\nthe austere Duke of Newcastle, arrived by river from Quebec in a\r\nperfect deluge of rain. But he did not land till next day and all\r\nwent well. The mayor, Mr. Rodier, the council, magistrates, the\r\nclergy, the heads of national and other societies with regalia,\r\nreceived him under a superb pavilion. Then followed the great\r\nprocession, headed by the Caughnawaga Indians in full native\r\ncostume. The scene was wild, with church bells ringing and the\r\nshouting of enthusiasm and loyalty. All the society of Canada\r\nhad come to the city to be present. The royal party visited the\r\nCrystal Palace, where an address was presented by the governor\r\ngeneral, Sir E.W. Head, and the Prince declared the Palace open.\r\n\r\nIn the afternoon took place the ceremony of the laying of the\r\nlast stone by the Prince of the Victoria Bridge. The royal\r\nparty entered the car of state and proceeded to the centre of\r\nthe bridge and the Prince drove in the last--a silver--rivet.\r\nThe party then proceeded to the other side of the river, where\r\nMr. Blackwell, in the name of the Grand Trunk, presented the\r\nPrince with a gold medal, executed by Wyon, commemorative of\r\nthe occasion, the suite receiving similar ones, but in silver.\r\nThe royal car then returned to the city. A great lunch took\r\nplace and the city and the harbour were given over that evening\r\nto wonderful illuminations, when the Prince rode through the\r\nstreets. On Sunday the Prince and royal party attended divine\r\nservice at the recently rebuilt Christ Church Cathedral on St.\r\nCatherine Street and were received at the door by Sir Fenwick\r\nWilliams and Sir A. Milne. Bishop Fulford officiated and Reverend\r\nMr. Wood read the sermon. In commemoration of this visit His\r\nRoyal Highness presented to the Cathedral a magnificent Bible\r\nwith an autograph inscription.\r\n\r\nIn the evening the Montreal Oratorio Society of 400 voices\r\nperformed a grand cantata especially written by a Mr. Semper and\r\ncomposed by M. Sabatier, in commemoration of the royal visit. On\r\nthis occasion Marie Louise Lajeunesse, afterward Madame Albani,\r\nsang. She was then unknown, although she had made her debut as\r\na piano player at the Mechanics’ Institute about 1854, when but\r\nseven years of age.\r\n\r\nThe great ball, at which the young Prince danced with the ladies\r\nof the charmed circle chosen by the committee of reception,\r\ntook place later in the completed Crystal Palace, a building of\r\ncolossal dimensions for the time, being nearly three hundred feet\r\nin diameter. It was then thought to be in the fields.\r\n\r\nA recent reminiscence of the time describes the scene:\r\n\r\n  “But the grand ball in Montreal was the climax of the Prince’s\r\n  visit. A special pavilion had been built for the occasion, and\r\n  here the élite of the city, the province, the whole country it\r\n  might be said, had assembled. The Prince with his suite appeared\r\n  about ten o’clock and opened the ball. The Duke of Newcastle\r\n  presented the Hon. Mrs. Young, and the ball was opened by the\r\n  Prince dancing with that lady. He had on his right the Hon. Mr.\r\n  Cartier with Mrs. Dumas, on his left Major Teesdale and Miss\r\n  Rodgers. On the Prince’s right were Governor Bruce and Mrs.\r\n  Denny, Captain Connolly, and Miss Penn; and on his left the Earl\r\n  of Mulgrave, and Miss de Lisle, and Captain De Winton and Miss\r\n  Tyre. His Royal Highness danced incessantly from half-past four\r\n  in the morning, with a large number of ladies, most of whom are\r\n  dead and gone.\r\n\r\n  “Among the ladies who had the honour of dancing with the Prince\r\n  were Miss de Lisle, Miss Tyre, Mrs. F. Brown, Miss Leach, Miss\r\n  Fisher, of Halifax, Mrs. Sicotte, Miss de Rocheblave, Mrs. C.\r\n  Freer, Miss Laura Johnson, Miss Belson, Miss Napier, Miss King,\r\n  Mrs. Forsythe, Miss Sophia Stewart, the Hon. Mrs. J.S. Macdonald,\r\n  Miss Servorte, Lady Milne, Mrs. King, Miss E. Smith.\r\n\r\n  Although all the ladies, or most of them, are dead, they have\r\n  relatives who might be interested in recalling the brilliant\r\n  scene, which was witnessed at the famous ball, which was\r\n  described with great particularity, even by the United States\r\n  press, which sent over many representatives.”\r\n\r\nOn Wednesday morning there was a review at Logan’s Farm,\r\nnow Lafontaine Park, the property of Sir William Logan, the\r\ngeologist, who was knighted about 1856, and the Prince appeared\r\nin his uniform as colonel of the One Hundred Prince of Wales\r\nRoyal Canadian Regiment. In the evening the firemen had a\r\ntorchlight procession, each fire fighter carrying a torch or\r\nRoman candle. On Thursday night the “peoples’ ball” took place\r\nin the new ballroom, with the Prince present. That night the\r\nfoot of the mountain was illuminated with fireworks. Next day\r\nthe royal party proceeded to Ottawa. The visit to Montreal was\r\na great success. Its cost to the citizens’ reception committee\r\nwas $43,031, not including the decorations of public buildings\r\nwhich cannot have been less than ten to twenty thousand dollars\r\nmore. One of the permanent mementos of the visit is the name of\r\nVictoria Square, which a by-law of the city changed from its\r\nformer title of Haymarket and Commissioners Square.\r\n\r\nOne of the acts of the young Edward, the Peacemaker, was on this\r\noccasion of his visit, to establish uniformity and harmony in\r\nthe various companies comprising the Prince of Wales Regiment,\r\nwhich had heretofore turned out on parade in different facings\r\nand different racial emblems according to the company. This had\r\nalways been provocative of rivalry, but henceforth uniformity\r\nruled.\r\n\r\nTwo events of artistic and literary interest marked this period.\r\nOn the 23d of April the Art Association of Montreal was formed\r\nand on August 13th the first number of the Daily Witness appeared.\r\n\r\nThe year 1861 stands out preeminently in the military history of\r\nthe city, for it was that of the Civil War between the northern\r\nand the southern states of the adjoining republic, and Montreal\r\nreflected the general turmoil. The Civil War began on January\r\n9th, when the Southern Confederacy fired into the Federal steamer\r\nStar of the West. It was early feared that there might be war\r\nbetween Great Britain and the United States and the North British\r\ntroops were ordered to Canada in January. Meanwhile, in January,\r\nthe city was excited over the case of a fugitive slave named\r\nAnderson charged with murder, whose extradition was demanded.\r\nA meeting was held and addressed by Messrs. Dorion, Drummond,\r\nHolton, Benjamin Holmes and John Dougall, Dr. W.H. Hingston and\r\nthe Rev. Messrs. W. Bond and Cordner, opposing surrender. In\r\nFebruary it was decided that Anderson was not to be delivered\r\nwithout instructions from England. Finally he reached England in\r\nJune.\r\n\r\nMontreal sympathies were with the Southerners, but as yet\r\naccording to instructions from Queen Victoria on May 13th, strict\r\nneutrality was to be observed. The position became, however,\r\nacute after November 8th, when Captain Wilkes, of the United\r\nStates warship San Jacinto, took from the British mailship Trent\r\nthe Confederates John Slidell and John G. Mason, Confederate\r\ncommissioners to the Imperial Government. On the refusal of the\r\nAmerican Government to hand them over, war was anticipated and\r\nthere was extreme tension. Six steamers were chartered to bring\r\ntroops to Canada. Reinforcements of regulars were sent from\r\nEngland and in Montreal, space being inadequate to receive them,\r\nthe Molson College on St. Mary Street, the Collège de Montreal\r\non College Street and the stores at the northeast corner of St.\r\nSulpice and Notre Dame streets, then recently erected on the\r\nsite of the property of Hôtel Dieu, which had been also recently\r\ntransferred to Pine Avenue, were leased and known as Victoria\r\nBarracks. Canada was prepared to share the troubles of the Empire\r\nshould war break out, and in consequence Montreal saw a hurrying\r\nto and fro of citizen soldiers. Recruiting in every arm of the\r\nservice and drilling went on everywhere. “Stand to your arms,”\r\n“Defense not defiance” and such mottoes are to be found in\r\nnewspapers of the period, in the exercise of their duty of making\r\npublic opinion.\r\n\r\nFor two weeks the tension was great in the city. One of the\r\nsoldiers has recently given his reminiscences of this time as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n  “We marched to Molson’s College in the east end. Yes, it was\r\n  called a college then, and had originally been built for some\r\n  educational purpose. It was at the back of St. Thomas’ Church, or\r\n  rather, this church, at the time, formed part of the building.\r\n  Back of this again, and close to the river, was Molson’s\r\n  Terrace, which is a pretty tawdry place today but which, when\r\n  I was stationed in the city with my regiment, was most select.\r\n  Why, the Molson’s themselves lived in the Terrace--that is, the\r\n  founders of the brewery and of the college. The houses were then\r\n  considered elegant, and that part of the city had a reputation\r\n  which it does not now possess.\r\n\r\n  “At the time I am speaking of, the total military strength of\r\n  Montreal was considerable. There was the First Battalion of\r\n  the Sixteenth Bedfordshire Regiment, to which I belonged. The\r\n  Forty-seventh Lancashire; the Fourth Battalion; Sixtieth Rifles,\r\n  which latter was quartered in the College Street Barracks; the\r\n  Second Battalion of the Guards; the Second Battalion of the\r\n  Scotch Fusiliers; three field batteries of Artillery, which later\r\n  were stationed at the Quebec Gate Barracks where the Dalhousie\r\n  Square depot is now, and the Forty-seventh Regiment.\r\n\r\n  “This Quebec Gate Barracks had two entrances--one on Water Street\r\n  for the men, and one on Notre Dame Street for the officers. In\r\n  that same barracks were two companies of the Royal Engineers. The\r\n  commissariat and two troops of the Military Train were stationed\r\n  at Hochelaga.\r\n\r\n  “The city was full of troops at the time. There was every belief\r\n  that we would speedily be at war with the North, but the ill\r\n  feeling passed over. Nothing happened. We remained, and lived the\r\n  lives of soldiers. We had good times; we had no care; we had our\r\n  beer; we had a brisk time in Montreal.”\r\n\r\nHis recollection of the officers is as follows:\r\n\r\n  “At that time the sons of noblemen thought it an honour to\r\n  belong to the army, and the officers in Montreal were, for the\r\n  most part, highly connected. Now the commission is obtained by\r\n  competitive examination; but the old soldiers like to be under\r\n  gentlemen born. Some of the officers stayed at the Donegana\r\n  Hotel, and many of them messed in the building opposite Dalhousie\r\n  Square, where the band played in the evening; but the bulk of the\r\n  higher officers put up at the St. Lawrence Hall. The officer of\r\n  the day, and the subaltern of the day, always lived in Molson’s\r\n  Terrace, to be near the scene of their duties.\r\n\r\n  “Several of the officers, I remember, put up at the Cosmopolitan\r\n  Hotel, which stood on the present site of the New York Life\r\n  Building. Opposite Molson’s brewery was the regimental hospital,\r\n  while the Garrison Hospital was on Water Street. Each regiment\r\n  had its own hospital.”[1]\r\n\r\nAt the time the hero of Kars, Lieut.-Gen. Sir William Fenwick\r\nWilliams, Bart., K.C.B.; commander of the forces in British North\r\nAmerica; Lord Paulet, in charge of the Guards; Sir William Muir,\r\nchief medical officer of the forces; Major Penn, of Crimean fame,\r\nin command of the gallant Grey Battery; Colonel Peacock, of the\r\nSixteenth Bedfordshire; and others, were among the officers then\r\nin Montreal.\r\n\r\nIn its midst news came of the death of Queen Victoria’s husband,\r\nthe Prince Consort. A loyal city sent its message of condolence\r\nto their beloved Queen. But on the release of Slidell and Mason\r\nthe war alarms were over. This good news came on December 28th,\r\nand on Sunday the continuance of peace between the Empire and the\r\nUnited States was devoutly and thankfully blessed. The outburst\r\nof militarism served to keep the companies as already organized\r\non a permanent basis. On January 1st, Slidell and Mason were\r\nreleased by the United States, but on January 4th Victoria Bridge\r\nhad still to be guarded for fear of destruction by marauders from\r\nacross the boundary.\r\n\r\n“The alarm, which soon subsided, was really the birth of modern\r\nmilitia movement in Canada. I remember well,” says Lieut.-Col.\r\nRobert Gardner, in a reminiscence, “the excitement that ruled\r\neverywhere. I can recollect the time when the business men and\r\nmerchants of Montreal were all imbued with the necessity of\r\ndefending their country. So enthusiastic were they that drilling\r\nwas going on practically all the time. Everyone expected war, and\r\npatriotic feelings ran high. Business men would slip out in the\r\nmorning and put in an hour at drill, another drill would be held\r\nafter lunch, and more in the evening. It was that war scare of\r\n1861-2 which really showed the necessity of a defensive force,\r\nand proved the forerunner of our militia system of today.”\r\n\r\nDuring the war there were, however, merry times at the hotels and\r\nat Dolly’s restaurant. A reminiscence relates:\r\n\r\n  “That was a merry time in Montreal. The Americans had plenty of\r\n  money, and were not afraid to spend it. The officers, too, were\r\n  well supplied, and they, too, were prodigal with it. St. James\r\n  Street was always busy, what with the soldiers and officers,\r\n  the Southerners, the local military, the excitement attending\r\n  the events of the war, and which were reflected in the city\r\n  in the matter of sentiment, as well as the matter of money. I\r\n  recollect very well that the feeling of our people was in favour\r\n  of the South in the struggle. As time went on, the conviction\r\n  gained ground that the South would be defeated; but the general\r\n  feeling was in its favour. This made life for the Southerners\r\n  very pleasant. They fraternized with the people; they spent their\r\n  money; they made life merry in and about the old St. Lawrence\r\n  Hall.”\r\n\r\nGreenbacks, however, were looked askance at till the fortunes of\r\nwar were with the North, so that silver was in demand. The Civil\r\nWar meant good times for Canada for the farmers’ produce and\r\nstock were readily bought by the United States.\r\n\r\nThe military troops in town came in for a great recognition on\r\nthe 6th, 7th and 8th of May, 1862, when they were feasted in\r\nsections on these days. It is recorded that among the items for\r\nthe festivities there were ordered 3,200 pounds of sandwiches,\r\n5,000 tarts, 3,700 pounds of cake, 50 barrels of fruit, besides\r\nan abundant supply of tea and coffee, the entertainments being on\r\nstrictly temperance principles.\r\n\r\nMontreal’s generosity was also that year shown to the destitute\r\noperatives in the manufacturing districts of England, when in\r\nconsequence of a meeting in the Merchants’ Exchange $30,000 was\r\nsubscribed for their relief.\r\n\r\nThe Civil War over, the arts of peace were resumed. The Montreal\r\nStreet Railway, started in the year previous, was making its\r\nhumble beginnings with its few horse-drawn cars. On April 2d\r\nthere was a municipal by-law to establish the fire brigade. On\r\nMay 20th, the Montreal waterworks were enlarged and improved as\r\na result of the dearth of water at this time which had caused\r\nthe ancient custom of providing water in puncheons again to be\r\nresorted to.\r\n\r\nThis year the Numismatic and Antiquarian Society was founded and\r\nthe Corn Exchange organized, being incorporated the next year,\r\nwhen eight floating elevators were proudly said to be discharging\r\nhourly 24,000 bushels.\r\n\r\n1863 saw the fire alarm established on January 19th, indicating\r\nthe progress of our fire service.\r\n\r\nOn July 15th, the Corvette Oernen, the first Norwegian vessel\r\nto visit the St. Lawrence, sailed up to Montreal and civic\r\nhospitality was again displayed as previously to the French\r\nvessel.\r\n\r\nThe Provincial Exhibition, held on the 9th of September of this\r\nyear, was superior to any other. A grand rifle tournament was\r\nopened by Sir William Fenwick Williams and lasted over ten days.\r\n\r\nOn April 21, 1864, there appeared a published letter of D’Arcy\r\nMcGee, the Irish poet, litterateur and politician, in which he\r\nsaid: “Even the threat of assassination covertly conveyed and\r\nso eminently in keeping with the entire humbug has no terrors\r\nfor me. I trust I shall outlive these threats,” indicates that\r\nthere was a ring of organized Fenianism in the city in sympathy\r\nwith the movement now looming large in the United States. About\r\nthis time he exposed the dangers and sophisms of those seducing\r\nthe young Irish of the city and moreover told some of his young,\r\nhotheaded auditors at several meetings, then and subsequently,\r\nthat he held in his pocket evidence enough to hang some of them.\r\n“I ask you,” he said, “to frown upon this thing. I ask you to\r\nhave nothing to do with it. I tell you that I know many of the\r\nmen who are associated with Fenianism. And I say this, that if\r\nthey do not separate themselves from the organization, I will\r\ndenounce them to the Government. Come out from among them. The\r\norganization will bring you to ruin. There are some who think\r\nthey are secure; that they can go on and that they cannot be\r\nfound out. I tell you I know such, and will denounce them if they\r\ndo not mend their ways.”\r\n\r\nAt this time McGee was told that his days were numbered. Thus\r\ncoming events cast their shadows before. But Confederation was in\r\nthe air and its discussion was uppermost.\r\n\r\nThe Shakespeare centenary of 1864 was brilliantly celebrated\r\nat Montreal in April at the Crystal Palace. But sad news fell\r\nupon the city when, on June 29th, a train of eleven cars, having\r\naboard 354 German emigrants leaving St. Hilaire for Montreal,\r\nwas precipitated through an open drawbridge into the river at\r\nBeloeil. Ninety were killed and a very large number were drowned.\r\nThe hospitable city opened its hospitals and public institutions\r\nfor the sufferers and the bodies of the dead were brought to the\r\ncity and buried in the Protestant cemeteries.\r\n\r\nIn September, 1864, the city saw the departure of six companies\r\nof the Scotch Fusileers and other military.\r\n\r\nIn November there was excitement in the city over the St. Alban’s\r\nraiders who had been captured and brought to the city for\r\nexamination. On the 19th of October some southern raiders from\r\nCanada had made a descent on the St. Alban’s bank, compelling\r\nMr. Sowles, the cashier, to surrender the bank’s money, and\r\nafter intimidating the citizens, saying that “we represent the\r\nConfederate States of America and we come here to retaliate\r\noutrages committed by General Sherman,” they had returned to\r\nCanada on captured horses.\r\n\r\nOn March 30th of the next year, the St. Alban raiders were\r\ndischarged. On this occasion Mr. Bernard Devlin had an opportunity\r\nof airing his forensic eloquence, being employed to defend certain\r\nof the prisoners. It is said that the motive behind the raid was\r\nto make a diversion in favour of the South by means of the raid\r\nwhich was to bring Federal troops from southern points to defend\r\nthe invaded territory of the North.\r\n\r\nThe year 1865, which opened with the usual spring floods in\r\nApril, was otherwise an interesting and exciting time to the\r\nmerchants of the town, for Mr. Adams, the American minister\r\nin London, gave the requisite notice to terminate reciprocity\r\nbetween the United States and Canada on March 17, 1866. In\r\nJuly there was a convention at Detroit, from the 11th to the\r\n14th, which promoted the forming of a new reciprocity treaty.\r\nAt this several Montrealers attended, but only to give desired\r\ninformation. In September there was a delegation to Montreal to\r\nform an International Board of Trade. This year the Board of\r\nTrade Building, erected in 1855, was burnt down.\r\n\r\nThe following resolution, passed unanimously on April 19th by\r\nthe city council, on the motion of Alderman Grenier, seconded\r\nby Alderman Rodden, on the occasion of the assassination of the\r\nPresident of the United States, shows the gloom and commiseration\r\nof the city which went into mourning on the day of the funeral:\r\n\r\n“Resolved, That in respect to the memory of the late President\r\nof the United States and sympathy with the people in the great\r\ncalamity which has befallen them, and also as an expression of\r\nthe regret and horror felt at the crime perpetrated upon the\r\nperson of President Lincoln, this council do now adjourn.”\r\n\r\nThis allows us to cast a glance at our peaceful municipal life.\r\nOne[2] who knew it well has recently recorded his reminiscences:\r\n\r\n  “Citizens criticized the council then as they do today and on\r\n  one particular occasion they manifested their disapprobation on\r\n  some burning question by gathering in front of the council room,\r\n  and, after due oratory from their leader, sent a volley of stones\r\n  through the windows, to show the depth of their feelings. This\r\n  stirred up the members most effectively, and if the celerity\r\n  with which they jumped from one place to another, to avoid the\r\n  ‘arguments’ was any indication of the attention they would\r\n  give to the cause in question, it would not have remained long\r\n  unattended to.\r\n\r\n  “One member, however, more courageous than the others, kept his\r\n  seat with contemptuous indifference until he saw a missile coming\r\n  direct for his desk, when he cleverly caught it in his hands,\r\n  and called on the mayor to maintain order. His Worship looked\r\n  unutterable things, and told Darcy to do it. The latter, however,\r\n  disappeared, and was not seen more that night. It was suspected\r\n  he went over to the enemy, and when he told me next morning\r\n  that it was ‘the best bit of fun he had seen for many a day,’ I\r\n  thought there was ground for the suspicion.\r\n\r\n  “But criticisms of the council were not confined to\r\n  demonstrations of this kind. The press was not backward in saying\r\n  what it thought, although in a more refined and cultured way. One\r\n  editor, for instance, gave a free notice of a meeting of council\r\n  in the following words, in large type:\r\n\r\n  “‘The Municipal Banditti meet in their den at the City Hall at 8\r\n  o’clock this evening.’\r\n\r\n  “We were more deliberate in those days than at the present. We\r\n  were deliberate in all things. We did not hurry away the snow as\r\n  we do now. We thought it cheaper to let the sun do that. Now in\r\n  this advanced age we think nothing of spending $10,000 to beat\r\n  the sun by twenty-four hours; but speed is everything today. At\r\n  the time of speaking our whole revenue was not one-fourth of the\r\n  interest on our debt today.\r\n\r\n  “I have enumerated the personnel to show the speed of time, for\r\n  at the present time not one of those mentioned, except myself,\r\n  remain. They have all passed to the ‘majority.’\r\n\r\n  “Prominently among the aldermen of that period were Ferdinand\r\n  David, and William Rodden; the former as chairman of the roads\r\n  committee, may be regarded as having been the father of our\r\n  expropriation system, and the latter, as chairman of finance, was\r\n  regarded as the father of our 7 per cent consolidation. Were both\r\n  these men alive today they would be appalled at the outcome of\r\n  their pet schemes. In those days we spoke with bated breath of\r\n  $100,000, now we play with the millions as a very little thing.\r\n  Then our 6 per cent securities sold at a heavy discount, since\r\n  then our 3 per cent securities have sold over par.\r\n\r\n  “An orator about this time, haranguing the taxpayers from the\r\n  steps of the Nelson Monument, assured them that if they should\r\n  elect him as their representative, he would reduce their taxes\r\n  150 per cent. Poor fellow, he meant well, but he was allowed to\r\n  sink, with his invaluable arithmetical genius, into oblivion,\r\n  while the other one, who was able to rouse another mob, occupies\r\n  a seat on the king’s bench. This shows that it is better to break\r\n  people’s windows than to abolish their taxes and give them a 50\r\n  per cent bonus beside. O, tempora, O, mores.”\r\n\r\nThis year (1865) Sir John Michel was sworn in as administrator\r\nof the governor general, then absent in England. As he took up\r\nhis residence in the city and during his administration the\r\nexecutive council met here twice in each month, this event may be\r\nchronicled in the series of social events.\r\n\r\nThe peaceful progress of the inhabitants was again thrown into\r\nconfusion and the military spirit reincarnated when news came the\r\nlatter part of this year, 1865, that the threatened invasion of\r\nCanada by the Irish Fenian Brotherhood, led by “General” O’Neil,\r\nwere at last becoming actual. They made use of the ill-feeling\r\naroused between the United States and Britain by an element\r\ndiscontented through hard times, to strike a long premeditated\r\nblow. The first Fenian invasion eventually came to nothing at all\r\nof importance, but it was a great scare. Montreal was on the _qui\r\nvive_ for a while, fearing the invasion, for the supineness of\r\nthe American Government in allowing the invasion to be planned\r\nand provided for by filibusters, gave an unpleasant impression,\r\nsuggesting that there might, possibly, be serious consequence if\r\na strong front were not presented to the audacious attempt. The\r\nfeeling, too, at the time, was not too friendly to Canada, which,\r\nwith Great Britain, was supposed to sympathize with the South\r\nduring the Civil War.\r\n\r\nOn Monday, March 13, 1866, a company of the Prince of Wales\r\nregiment and a battery of artillery were reviewed at 5 P.M. and\r\nby 9 P.M. were sent to the threatened frontier. A patriotic\r\n“relief” fund was started on March 26th. On June 2d, on account\r\nof news arriving on June 1st, the Fenians being already at Fort\r\nErie, a further detachment of four more companies were sent to\r\nthe west, viz., Nos. 3 and 8 batteries of the Brigade of the\r\nMontreal Garrison Artillery, under Captains Brown and Hobbes; a\r\ncompany of Prince of Wales Rifles, under Captain Bond; Victoria\r\nRifles, under Captain Bacon; Royal Light Infantry, under Capt.\r\nK. Campbell; and the Chasseurs Canadiens, under Captain Labelle,\r\nwho all left by special train for Point St. Charles for St. Johns\r\nand Isle aux Noix. The same evening a strong reinforcement of\r\nregulars left for the same stations, and on the 4th, several\r\nadditional companies of volunteers were dispatched to Hemingford\r\nand other places along the frontier. Among those going to the\r\nfront were the famous “Barney” Devlin, the great criminal lawyer\r\nand the political opponent of D’Arcy McGee, and the Rev. Father\r\nJames Hogan of St. Patrick’s, who acted as chaplain.\r\n\r\nThe chief fight in Lower Canada was at Pigeon Hill, in the\r\nTownship of St. Armand, adjoining the State of Vermont, which was\r\nattacked by the Fenians on June 17th, but from which, after a\r\nbrief skirmish, they retired, not without several of their party\r\nbeing secured as prisoners by the “Montreal Guides,” and being\r\nbrought, a sorry and ragged crowd, to the city gaol.\r\n\r\nOn June 18th, the volunteer companies returned, being welcomed\r\nenthusiastically by their fellow citizens, and June 23d was\r\nobserved as a day of general rejoicing and inspection. The mayor,\r\non behalf of the civic authorities, tendered an address to the\r\ntroops, offering sincere expressions of gratitude and thanks\r\nfor their devotion, loyalty and courage in the late emergency,\r\nand bidding them a hearty welcome back to the city and to\r\ntheir happy homes and beloved and expectant families. This was\r\nresponded to by Major-General Lindsay.\r\n\r\nThe loyalty of all sections of the community had again been\r\nproved against a common enemy. Every section had answered\r\nthe call to arms, for Fenianism, after all, had few weighty\r\nsupporters in Montreal.\r\n\r\nThe military enthusiasm, however, evoked by the late events had\r\nan immediate effect in determining the city council and other\r\nauthorities already considering the point, to open a drill hall\r\ncapable of meeting the increased demands, and in May, 1867, the\r\ncontract for the armory on Craig Street, opposite the Champ de\r\nMars, was given to Foster & Roy.\r\n\r\nThe confederation of the provinces was now in the air. It was\r\nnot universally understood at the time and it was feared, and\r\nsomewhat actively combatted, especially by the group of young\r\nFrench-Canadians opposed to Cartier in their new journal the\r\nUnion Nationale, as likely to absorb them so that they might lose\r\ntheir political identity.\r\n\r\nConfederation was, however, to mark a great period of progress\r\nand to see Montreal emerge from provincial citydom to the\r\ngreat metropolis of today. Before passing to the story of its\r\nachievement, a glance back will show that Montreal was a very\r\nquiet place under the Union. Yet it produced strong-minded and\r\nable men, even if the racial, religious and political rancours\r\nof a “heart burning town” showed themselves in no equivocal\r\ncolours. The foundations of our present artistic, literary,\r\nreligious, charitable and financial associations were also\r\nalready being well laid. The life was simple; there was not much\r\nsociety but great heartiness. There were no millionaires, but the\r\npeople spent freely. Public amusements were fewer, but private\r\nhospitality greater. The city hall was decorous, there were no\r\nemoluments for service, and the best men of the time thought it\r\nan honour to represent their wards.\r\n\r\nInto the simplicity of the life there entered the society\r\ncentering around the military. At the close of the Union there\r\nwere about a hundred officers generally stationed here, many\r\nof them distinguished men of high rank and fame. There were\r\noften four or five regiments in the town, and the soldiery\r\nfraternized with the citizens. Pranks there were, the ringing of\r\nbells, the wrenching off of knockers and signs, and more serious\r\npeccadillos, but the indulgent public was not censorious. The\r\nofficers gave many parties, balls, receptions, dances and hunts,\r\nall of which the prominent citizens participated in and returned.\r\nThere were not highly organized kennel or hunt clubs, but they\r\nranged the country far and wide. The officers were good judges of\r\nhorse flesh as were the humbler citizens and Tattersalls, on St.\r\nJames Street, opposite the present Star offices, was a busy place\r\nfor such. It was no infrequent sight to see the horses being\r\ntrotted up and down past Dolly’s, St. Lawrence Hall and Banque\r\ndu Peuple for inspection along the street which is today’s busy\r\nfinancial thoroughfare, lined with banks and insurance buildings.\r\n\r\nThe ordinary people participated indirectly in the gaiety of the\r\nmilitary régime through the brisk, lively trade with the officers\r\nand soldiery, who spent freely.\r\n\r\nThe life, colour, and zest they gave were also a free\r\nentertainment. Not only were the streets bright with the uniforms\r\nof the soldiers and gay with the sound of fife, drum and brass,\r\nbut the people would make their way to the Champ de Mars during\r\nthe day to see the evolutions of the military, where the firing\r\nof the cannon frightened the timid boys and girls, or in the\r\nearly evening the young folk would stroll sweethearting to\r\nDalhousie Square (now the Viger Station tracks) to hear the\r\nregimental bands in Barrack Square, and the boys and girls, now\r\nno way shy, would peep in at the mysteries of the officers’ mess,\r\nwhich was in plain view. The music would last for hours and the\r\nsquare would resound with laughter till the sun-down gun from St.\r\nHelen’s Island proclaimed the time for early bed.\r\n\r\nArt, literature and music were cultivated by associations at the\r\ntime and to these the military officers contributed no little\r\ninitiative. The scholastic system of the two boards of school\r\ncommissioners was being solidified and Montreal at the end of\r\nthe Union was progressing substantially, but not so dramatically\r\nor so visibly as after the next few decades when bustle began to\r\nrule. Life was then more leisurely, more reposeful and at least\r\nquite as happy and more contented.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[1] Reminiscences of Private Fitzgerald, who came out with the\r\nSixteenth Bedfordshire Regiment in 1861.

This has been brought about by its\r\ngeographical situation and its public men. From the first the\r\ncity has been favored in its sons--men who have controlled the\r\ndestinies of the growing country, and who in turn have been\r\ninfluenced by their closer environments. This is seen in the\r\nconstitutional acts of both the Province and the Dominion, for\r\npractically most public events, particularly since Confederation,\r\nhave been shaped to meet the requirements of the commercial\r\nmetropolis.\r\n\r\nConfederation had its opponents, particularly amongst the younger\r\nmembers of the “parti rouge” or democratic party, who in Lower\r\nCanada, but now the Province of Quebec, had been waiting for an\r\nopportunity to break the power of Sir George Etienne Cartier,\r\nthe great French Canadian leader in the confederation movement,\r\nso that in the elections called for to ratify the British North\r\nAmerica Act, they determined, in spite of the advice to the\r\ncontrary, of their brilliant leader (Dorion), to give Cartier\r\nthe fight of his life. The new Federal government realized that\r\nthe permanency of the constitution depended largely on the\r\nattitude of Quebec and much anxiety was felt as to the results of\r\nthe elections which were to be held in the autumn of 1867--the\r\nBritish North America Act having come into force on July 1st.\r\n\r\nCartier particularly realized the crisis, and put his whole\r\nenergy into the fight. He personally contested Montreal East,\r\nnow St. James Division, having as opponent Médéric Lanctot,\r\na popular labour leader. Every division in the Province was\r\ncontested, but thanks to the strong stand made by the Roman\r\nCatholic[1] church in approving Confederation, the party headed\r\nby Cartier, who beat his opponent, won and the new constitution\r\nwas confirmed in the Province of Quebec forty-three out of\r\nsixty-five seats. In Ontario the government won sixty-eight\r\nout of eighty-five seats and in New Brunswick twelve out of\r\nfifteen seats, but in Nova Scotia, owing to the opposition of\r\nJoseph Howe, only one government supporter, Charles Tupper, was\r\nreturned. On the whole, Confederation was confirmed by the people.\r\n\r\nPractically this most momentous election--upon which depended the\r\nfuture of Canada’s national life--was decided in Montreal, for\r\nhad Cartier failed in winning his own seat, the impetus given to\r\nthe “parti rouge” would have been strong enough to have wrecked\r\nthe government and consequently the British North America Act.\r\nThe Provincial legislature returns showed a similar result, the\r\nfirst provincial premier being that brilliant Montreal writer and\r\norator, the Hon. P.J.O. Chauveau, who held office until 1873, his\r\ntwo immediate successors in the premiership being Montrealers\r\nalso, the Hon. G. Ouimet and Sir Charles E.B. de Boucherville.\r\nThe last named is still living, in the best of health, though in\r\nhis ninety-fourth year, and enjoying the dual offices of Senator\r\nfor Canada, and member of the Legislative Council of Quebec. Sir\r\nCharles is the last of the dual office men.\r\n\r\nDuring the adjourned session of the first Dominion parliament\r\nwhich had met in Ottawa in March, 1868, the Hon. Thomas D’Arcy\r\nMcGee, who represented Montreal West, was assassinated just\r\noutside his Ottawa lodging. There is no doubt that this dastardly\r\noutrage was the consequence of Mr. McGee’s condemnation of the\r\nFenian movement against Canada, and though one man, Whelan, an\r\nex-soldier and tailor, suffered the extreme penalty for being the\r\ninstrument, the real miscreants got away. The murder of D’Arcy\r\nMcGee robbed this country of one of her best sons. Brilliant\r\nand large minded he had risen to cabinet rank before he was\r\nthirty-eight years of age and in the last government under the\r\nUnion he held the port-folio of Agriculture. Always a believer\r\nin the closest union between the component parts of British\r\nNorth America, he was an eloquent advocate for Confederation and\r\non the formation by Sir J.A. Macdonald of the first Dominion\r\ngovernment (1868) McGee’s eminent services gave him every right\r\nto be included, but his sense of loyalty made him stand aside so\r\nas to allow Sir John to form his cabinet on territorial lines.\r\nThis great man, whose remains rest in Cote de Neiges Cemetery, is\r\nstill--forty-six years after his death--the outstanding figure of\r\nIrish Canadianism--an example in broad mindedness and patriotism.\r\n\r\nAnother Father of Confederation was the Hon. A.T. Galt, whose\r\nrepresentation of Sherbrooke, P.Q., and his years of residence\r\nhere, made him a local figure. Mr. Galt’s great financial\r\nability was very helpful in making equitable arrangements in the\r\nconsolidation of the Dominion. To commemorate the consummation\r\nof confederation the Hon. J.A. Macdonald received the honour of\r\nKnight Commander of the Bath, while his co-workers, including\r\nCartier and Galt, received companionships of the Bath. The title\r\nwas refused by both Cartier and Galt for the reason that being\r\nrepresentatives of Lower Canada they could not accept a lesser\r\ntitle than Sir John Macdonald. The difficulty was overcome by a\r\nbaronetcy conferred on Cartier and a K.C.M.G. on Galt.\r\n\r\nIn 1868 Cartier and William McDougall went to England on\r\nbehalf of the Canadian government to negotiate the transfer of\r\nthe Western territories from the Hudson’s Bay Company to the\r\nDominion. The Hudson’s Bay Company asked the sum of $5,000,000\r\nfor the cession of its rights but had to be satisfied with\r\n$1,500,000 and a reservation of one-twentieth of the fertile\r\nbelt. But a new difficulty had arisen in the transfer--in the\r\nterritory itself--for in 1870 the half-breed settlers, who\r\nhad the distinctive title of the “Metis,” feeling that they\r\nand their holdings had not been affected--stopped the new\r\nlieutenant-governor, the Hon. William McDougall at the border,\r\nand under Louis Riel the first North West rebellion was started,\r\nsoon, however, to be broken. It was in this rebellion that\r\nthe late Lord Strathcona, as chief officer of the Hudson’s\r\nBay Company, was first brought into the public limelight. Mr.\r\nDonald Smith, as he was then known, and whose headquarters were\r\nat Montreal, was asked to go to Fort Garry (now Winnipeg) with\r\nCol. de Salaberry and Abbé Thibault with the object of pacifying\r\nthe settlers, but the mission failed. On the breakdown of the\r\nrebellion Donald Smith administered the affairs of the territory\r\nuntil the arrival of Lieutenant-Governor Archibald.\r\n\r\nAround this time (1870) the home government withdrew the Imperial\r\ntroops from Canada--with the exception of a garrison left at\r\nHalifax--which was a blow to the social life of the commercial\r\nmetropolis. The officers of the local garrison with their bright\r\nuniforms and gentlemanly manners and their cultivated entourage\r\nhad been an acquisition to Montreal society, literary, social and\r\nartistic.\r\n\r\nThe material building up of Canada, and particularly Montreal,\r\nhas been made possible by the splendid transportation facilities,\r\nboth by stream, canal and rail, engineered by the big men of the\r\ntime. During the ’70s and ’80s Montreal was well represented by\r\nnames like Cartier, Dorion, and Sir John Rose, who though in\r\nseparate political camps fought hard together for the Grand Trunk\r\nin parliament, and won.\r\n\r\nCartier in introducing the Victoria Bridge Bill met much\r\nopposition; the principal objection being that it would take\r\nthe trade out of the country. His reply, which proved correct,\r\nwas that the bridge would bring trade into the country. In the\r\nagitation for the Intercolonial Railway with its terminus at\r\nMontreal, Cartier was the leader. He was also the introducer into\r\nthe parliament of 1872 of the first Canadian Pacific Bill. Both\r\nof these undertakings were urged as the best and most practical\r\nmeans of consolidating the new Dominion.\r\n\r\nOne cannot leave railway legislation without referring to what\r\nis known as the Canadian Pacific scandals, though Sir Charles\r\nTupper in his “Reminiscences of Sixty Years” writes of it as the\r\n“Canadian Pacific Slanders,” because two of the principal actors\r\nwere Montrealers and the place, Montreal. The bare facts are: Two\r\ncompanies, one of which was under the control of Sir Hugh Allan\r\nof Montreal, had competed for the construction of the railroad,\r\nthe bill for which the Government, through Cartier, had passed in\r\nparliament. Owing to disputes an effort was made to amalgamate\r\nthe companies but without avail, so that Sir Hugh formed a new\r\ncompany under the title of the Canadian Pacific Railway Company.\r\nThis Company obtained a charter on February 19, 1873, to build\r\nthe railway, and it was in connection with the granting of this\r\ncharter that in the following April a Mr. L.A. Huntingdon charged\r\nthe government with making a corrupt bargain with Sir Hugh Allan;\r\nin other words, that the Montreal promoter and his company had\r\nadvanced large sums of money to the Conservative fund to secure\r\nthe returns of candidates favourable to their obtaining the\r\ncharter. The receiving of the money was neither contradicted\r\nby the government nor the contractors, and on behalf of the\r\ngovernment it was offered as an extenuating circumstance that it\r\nwas only in accordance with the “invariable custom,” and before\r\na Royal Commission the ministers denied any corrupt bargain\r\nhaving been made. But the whole country was up in arms, and Sir\r\nJohn Macdonald, seeing inevitable defeat for his government,\r\nplaced his resignation in the hands of the Governor-General.\r\nIn the elections which followed, the new government, under the\r\nleadership of the new premier, the Hon. Alexander McKenzie, was\r\nsustained by a large majority.\r\n\r\nWhen in 1870 the Fenians for the second time under “General”\r\nO’Neill made a raid into Canada, crossing the border at Trout\r\nLake in the Eastern Townships, a flutter was caused at Montreal,\r\nbut the “general” was soon routed by a small contingent made up\r\nlargely by volunteers from Montreal.\r\n\r\nOwing to a depression in trade, which set in about the fall of\r\n1873 and which gradually grew worse in centres like Montreal\r\nas the years rolled by, Sir John A. Macdonald’s appeal to the\r\ncountry that it should protect its own industries by placing\r\nheavy duties against goods imported from other countries, met\r\nwith success and he was returned at the elections of 1878 by a\r\nlarge majority. This became known as the “National Policy” and\r\nthough immediate prosperity was the outcome, there is no doubt\r\nthat the same policy has made possible the formation of trusts,\r\nwhich in this country go under the name of mergers.\r\n\r\nThe next constitutional act of importance that affected Montreal\r\nwas the passing of an act which relieved the elections from the\r\nold time voting. On May 26, 1876, a Federal bill was passed\r\nintroducing the vote by ballot, simultaneous elections, the\r\nabolition of property qualifications for members of the House of\r\nCommons and making stringent enactments against corrupt practices\r\nat elections.\r\n\r\nThe Canada Temperance Bill of 1878 (usually called the Scott Act)\r\nwas the result of a great temperance movement that spread over\r\nthe whole of Canada and has been the foundation in Montreal of\r\nscores of temperance societies. Practically all the churches have\r\njoined in lessening the drink evil and on the same platforms will\r\nbe found the Roman Catholic and Anglican bishops of Montreal, as\r\nwell as the ministers of other denominations. Montreal is a much\r\nmore temperate city today than it was thirty years ago, in spite\r\nof a rapidly growing cosmopolitan population.\r\n\r\nAbout this time (1878) there occurred in Montreal the Orange\r\nriots, which resulted in the death of one of the citizens named\r\nHackett by shooting, an event of no importance, though magnified\r\nby certain writers.\r\n\r\nIn 1885 occurred the second North West rebellion. This was felt\r\nvery deeply in Montreal for the reason that, the insurgents\r\nbeing French half-breeds, charges of disloyalty were made\r\nagainst the whole French speaking people. To show its sense of\r\nloyalty Montreal despatched a large contingent to the scene of\r\nthe disturbance, including the French-Canadian regiment--The\r\nMount Royal Rifles, now known as the Sixty-fifth Regiment. This\r\nregiment did some remarkable work, marching as many as forty-five\r\nmiles a day through brush and muskeg and arriving in time to take\r\npart in the routing out at Frog Lake of Big Bear, the Cree Chief\r\nwho was supporting Riel, the rebel leader. The spirit of loyalty\r\nunderlying this splendid achievement was sufficient evidence of\r\nthe patriotism of French Canadianism, even to satisfy the most\r\nrabid of partisans.\r\n\r\nThe execution of Riel, which took place in Regina in the\r\nlatter part of the year, again raised the racial cry and many\r\ndemonstrations were held in Montreal by both French and English\r\npartisans. To exaggerate the feeling of bitterness, about\r\nthis time small-pox had broken out and the heads of the local\r\nindustries having insisted on vaccination and the bulk of the\r\nemployees being French Canadian, the cry was raised that the\r\nemployers were interfering with the work of Providence.\r\n\r\nMontreal has not been directly affected by what is commonly known\r\nas the “school question,” that has at different times raised so\r\nmuch bitterness in other parts of Canada, particularly in New\r\nBrunswick and Manitoba, but because the majority of its citizens\r\nare Roman Catholics, and the fact of its own separate school\r\nsystem working satisfactorily, the local political parties have\r\nalways taken a keen interest in the school problem in the other\r\nprovinces, and every government when dealing with it has to\r\ntake Montreal sentiment into account. This Cartier found to his\r\ncost in the 1872 elections, when, because his government sided,\r\nthough only on legal grounds, with the New Brunswick Provincial\r\ngovernment in its determination not to have separate schools,\r\nhe lost his seat to Mr. L.A. Jetté, who afterwards became\r\nLieutenant-Governor of the Province. Again because in Manitoba\r\nin 1890 the provincial legislature, by adopting nonsectarian\r\nschools, had in the minds of Roman Catholics broken the clause of\r\nthe Manitoba Act of 1870, which secured to the religious minority\r\nthe right in respect to denominational schools, much bitterness\r\nwas caused in Montreal. To this vexed question a settlement was\r\nbrought about in 1896 by the Laurier government, by which the\r\nManitoba Government while adhering to the principle of a national\r\nschool system under provincial control, agreed to make provision\r\nfor religious teaching during certain school hours.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1888 two Montrealers of cabinet rank died, Sir John\r\nRose, a former cabinet member, and Hon. Thomas White, M.P.,\r\nMinister of the Interior.\r\n\r\nMontreal in 1891 was particularly honoured in one of its citizens\r\nin the person of Hon. J.J.C. Abbott, who had twice been mayor,\r\nbecoming Premier of Canada on the death of Sir John A. Macdonald,\r\nthough he only held office for little more than a year, resigning\r\nNovember, 1892, on account of ill-health. In this year also died\r\nSir A.A. Dorion, Chief Justice of Queen’s Bench, Montreal, who\r\nhad been a big factor in the public life of Canada. As leader of\r\nthe Liberals, or “patri rouge,” he was Sir G.E. Cartier’s chief\r\nopponent, and on the formation of the Liberal Government of 1873,\r\nhe was appointed Minister of Justice, which office he resigned on\r\nJune 1, 1874, to become Chief Justice of Montreal.\r\n\r\nOn August 15, 1893, the Behring Sea Tribunal of Arbitration, of\r\nwhich Canada’s Prime Minister was a member, gave the decision\r\nthat the Behring Sea was to be kept open and that seals be\r\nprotected. At a banquet given in his honour by the citizens\r\nof Montreal, the Premier in a great speech explained Canada’s\r\nadvantage by the arbitration.\r\n\r\nIn 1895 a treaty was made between this country and France which\r\nlargely affected the trade of Montreal, because of the impetus\r\ngiven by the agreement to the importation of wines.\r\n\r\nWhen the Liberals came into power in 1896, very largely on a\r\nFree Trade policy, it was found inexpedient by the government\r\nto change the general tariff of the country, but it made a\r\ncompromise in 1899 by giving a preferential tariff of 25% to\r\nBritish made goods, which in 1901 was increased to 33⅓%. This was\r\na popular move and no doubt, together with the wave of prosperity\r\nwhich spread itself over the country and in which Montreal\r\nlargely participated, did much to keep the Liberals in power for\r\nfifteen years.\r\n\r\nIn 1898 the Boer war broke out, when the country as a whole\r\ndemanded that the Federal government on behalf of Canada should\r\ntake its share of the burden, although there was a certain\r\ncontra agitation amongst a section of French Canadians, led by\r\nthe eloquent and versatile grandson of Louis Joseph Papineau M.\r\nHenri Bourassa, who afterwards became the Chief of the young\r\nNationalist Party.\r\n\r\nIn October of 1899, Mr. Bourassa gave up his seat for St.\r\nHyacinthe in the Federal House in order to vindicate his position\r\non the constitutional aspect of the participation of Canada in\r\nthe South African war, contending that such participation, as\r\ncontemplated and organized by the British Government and its\r\nrepresentative in Canada, meant a deep change in our relations\r\nwith Great Britain upon which the people of Canada should be\r\nthoroughly enlightened and directly consulted. In January of the\r\nfollowing year he was returned by acclamation.\r\n\r\nThough the attitude taken by Mr. Bourassa was mostly academic\r\nyet, like his renewal in 1914 of a similar obstructional and\r\ndialectical position, not always understood by the general public\r\nespecially in time of war, it helped to encourage demonstrations\r\nof loyalty and patriotism throughout the Dominion, which forced\r\nthe government to raise an expeditionary force. The first\r\ncontingent embarked for the Transvaal October 30, 1899. At\r\nthe beginning of the following year, Lord Strathcona equipped\r\na mounted infantry regiment of 500, which became famous as\r\n“Strathcona’s Horse.” This body was despatched to South Africa\r\nwith the second contingent. The Canadian regiments throughout\r\nthe war did splendid service, particularly at Paardeburg, when\r\nthe Boer general Cronje was completely surrounded and defeated.\r\nMontreal itself contributed largely to the contingent which\r\nrepresented Canada.\r\n\r\nIn 1902 the Nationalist League was organized by Mr. J.T. Olivar\r\nAsselin, who became president of the Montreal branch and Mr.\r\nHenri Bourassa became recognized as the outstanding leader. The\r\nNationaliste was founded as the party organ in 1904 by its editor\r\nMr. Asselin who, on its lapse, became a writer on the Devoir\r\nfounded by Mr. Henri Bourassa.\r\n\r\nA political event of far reaching importance took place in\r\n1910 when the Hon. William Fielding and the late Hon. William\r\nPatterson on behalf of the Canadian Government signed an\r\nagreement with the government of the United States by which\r\ncertain goods, principally food-stuffs, were to pass from one\r\ncountry to the other free of duty. Since 1866 the United States\r\nhad steadily refused all offers to negotiate for reciprocal\r\nrelations, but in the spring of 1910 they veered around and sent\r\nplenipotentiaries to Ottawa. The Dominion Government received\r\nthem courteously and sent Messrs. Fielding and Patterson to\r\nWashington to carry on the negotiations, which resulted in what\r\nbecame known as the “Reciprocity Pact.” But in submitting the\r\nagreement to the country for ratification in the election of 1911\r\nthe government was badly defeated. It should be stated though\r\nthat the main issue itself throughout the country, and especially\r\nin Montreal, had become involved, from a question originally of\r\npurely commercial reciprocity, into one also of fear of danger\r\nof annexation to the United States. This was sufficient to bring\r\nout the latent patriotism of the electors, who gave a very\r\ndecided answer to those across the line who had any belief in the\r\nAmerican slogan that reciprocity was to be but the first step\r\nto annexation. The Montreal election returns showed this very\r\nstrongly, not in the change of representatives, for there was\r\nnone, but in the comparison of the votes. In the country parts of\r\nthe Province the Navy Bill of 1910, which was unpopular with the\r\nFrench Canadians, gave an opportunity to the Nationalists, who\r\nby joining forces with the opposition were enabled to reduce the\r\nFederal Government’s majority sufficiently to cause its downfall.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE STRATHCONA HORSE (From the plaque on the\r\nStrathcona Monument, Dominion Square)]\r\n\r\nThe defeat of the Federal Government ended the lengthy\r\npremiership of Sir Wilfrid Laurier, one of the Empire’s great\r\nstatesmen. Sir Wilfrid has many associations with Montreal and\r\nmany of his triumphs, national as well as political, have taken\r\nplace in the city. The new government in 1911 introduced a bill\r\ninto Parliament giving a contribution of $35,000,000 to the\r\nBritish admiralty to represent Canada’s naval contribution to the\r\nEmpire. The bill passed the Commons but failed in the Senate.\r\nIt was in connection with this naval contribution that the late\r\nHon. F.D. Monk, the member for the Jacques Cartier division of\r\nthe city, and one of Montreal’s brightest and most upright minds,\r\nresigned from the government, his reason being that a plebiscite\r\nof the people should have been made on the naval question. His\r\ndeath following hard upon his departure from politics made the\r\nlatter the more deplored.\r\n\r\nOf importance to the Port of Montreal is the West Indian\r\ncommercial agreement made in 1913 between Canada and the British\r\nWest Indies. By this reciprocal pact Canada secured a new market\r\non advantageous terms, and the principal factor in bringing it\r\nabout was the Canadian West Indian League with its headquarters\r\nin Montreal.\r\n\r\nAs in Federal politics, so also in the life of the Provincial\r\nparliament, Montreal has also been a large factor, the principal\r\nreason being that it supplies the biggest share of the income of\r\nthe Province, and also because the city’s representatives have\r\nusually been leaders of thought and probity. Practically all the\r\npremiers, from confederation to the present holder of the office,\r\nhave been either citizens of Montreal or largely connected with\r\nthe city. In the first legislative assembly of 1867 Montreal had\r\nfour members; they being Sir George E. Cartier, Edward Cartier,\r\nhis brother, and law partner, and who Sir George always said\r\nwas the legal brains of the firm; A.W. Ogilvie, a prominent\r\nmember of one of Montreal’s best known families; and the Hon.\r\nLouis Beaubien, who became Commissioner of Agriculture in the de\r\nBoucherville and Flinn administrations. Since that time Montreal\r\nhas been represented at Quebec by such men as the Hon. L.O.\r\nTaillon (1875-1887) who became Premier in 1887, and afterwards\r\njoined the Federal government as Postmaster General; to-day\r\nhe is Postmaster of Montreal; Hon. James McShane (1878-1891),\r\nwho became in turn Provincial Minister of Public Works, Mayor\r\nof Montreal and Harbour Master of the Port; Hon. L.O. David\r\n(1886-1890), now Senator of Canada and City Clerk of Montreal;\r\nDr. G. A. Lacombe (1897-1908), the author of the famous Lacombe\r\nLaw of 1906, by which a debtor upon being too hard pressed by his\r\ncreditors could come under the protection of the courts without\r\nany extra cost to himself; Sir Lomer Gouin, the present Premier,\r\nwho first entered the legislature as member for St. James in\r\n1897; Henri Bourassa (1908-1909); D.J. Decarie (1897-1904),\r\nand his son, the Hon. Jérémie Decarie, Provincial Secretary,\r\nwho succeeded his father in the latter year; Hon. Dr. J.J.E.\r\nGuerin (1895-1904), Cabinet minister and Mayor of Montreal;\r\nRobert Bickerdike (1897-1900), the present federal member for\r\nSt. Lawrence division of the city; the Hon. H.B. Rainville and\r\nthe two George Washington Stephens--father and son--the one\r\nrepresenting Montreal Centre from 1881 to 1886 and the other the\r\nSt. Lawrence division, 1904 to 1908, being afterwards Chairman of\r\nthe Harbour Commission.\r\n\r\nThe work of the Provincial legislature being largely of a\r\nconstructive nature, such as the raising of taxes for the\r\nbuilding of roads and the conserving of its vast resources, its\r\nprincipal effect on the city of Montreal itself is the oversight\r\nof the legislative work of the city council, and if acceptable\r\nto make it legal by passing it in the form of amendments to the\r\ncity charter. In this respect a very important amendment to\r\nthe charter was made in 1910 as a result of the report of the\r\nCannon inquiry, which condemned the city administration of the\r\nperiod. Under the amendment the Council is cut in half by each\r\nward having one instead of two representatives, and its work is\r\nof a legislative nature only, leaving the administration subject\r\nto the ratification of the council, in the hands of a board of\r\ncontrol composed of four members, who with the mayor is elected\r\nby the city as a whole.\r\n\r\nFor a long time there has been a strong feeling that Montreal\r\nshould have more freedom and a large measure of Home Rule in its\r\nlocal affairs, some even going so far as to urge that the island\r\nof Montreal should be a separate Province. At present, there is\r\ncertainly a groping toward some such autonomy.\r\n\r\n\r\n      MONTREAL REPRESENTATIVES IN THE SENATE OF CANADA FROM\r\n                          CONFEDERATION\r\n\r\n  The Honourable:\r\n    Jacques Bureau\r\n    Louis Renaud\r\n    John Hamilton\r\n    James Ferrier\r\n    Thomas Ryan\r\n    F.X.A.

The curious reader is warned to pursue\r\nthe history of the main movements indicated, in the second part\r\nof special history.\r\n\r\nConfederation was received with mixed feelings. There were\r\nmany of the _parti national_ who thought that Confederation\r\ncame too soon, that it had been hurried through without the\r\npeople thoroughly being instructed in the details and without\r\ntheir being consulted, and that the French Canadians would be\r\npolitically annihilated, a foreboding never realized. It was\r\nindeed the quietus to the _parti national_, who had opposed it\r\nin their newspaper, the Union Nationale, established in 1865 by\r\nMédéric Lanctot, which represented the views of the young blood\r\nopposed to Cartier, such as Messrs. Joseph Loranger, Doutre,\r\nDorion, Judge Delorimier, Lanctot, Labelle, Laflamme and L.O.\r\nDavid, then a brilliant writer on its staff. But in 1867 on the\r\nadvent of Confederation agitation ceased and the inevitable was\r\naccepted with growing satisfaction. The country, however, was at\r\nthe time in a bad state, suffering from the abrogation of the\r\nreciprocity treaty in 1866.\r\n\r\nThe year 1868 marks an important event in the French Canadian\r\nlife of the city, for it saw the Papal Zouaves leave Montreal on\r\nFebruary 7th, to fight in Italy against Garibaldi who wished to\r\ncurtail the temporal sovereignty of the papal throne. On February\r\n15th the roof of St. Patrick’s Hall, the home of St. Patrick’s\r\nNational Society, at the south end of Craig Street, fell in. In\r\nMarch the first 3-cent letter stamp was issued in Canada, and on\r\nApril 1st the first postoffice savings banks were opened. This\r\nsame month saw the assassination of D’Arcy McGee at Ottawa. His\r\nfuneral took place in Montreal on April 13th and was a great\r\npublic testimonial to his citizenship and to his devotion to his\r\nadopted country.\r\n\r\nEighteen hundred and sixty-nine is remembered as the year the\r\npresent Governor General, H.R.H., the Duke of Connaught, then the\r\nyoung Prince Arthur, a bright, frolicsome, light-hearted boy,\r\nfirst came to the city, in August, to join his regiment, the\r\nFirst Battalion of the Rifle Brigade. Rosemount, at the head of\r\nSimpson Street, a house which was occupied by Sir John Rose, and\r\nafterwards owned by the Ogilvie family, was set aside for him,\r\nunder the tutelage of Lord Elphinstone. His advent added to the\r\nmilitary and social gaiety of the small city. Among the brilliant\r\nofficers then in the city was Col. Garnett Wolseley, then known\r\nonly as a gallant officer who had served in the Crimea, who had\r\nnow gone on the Red River expedition to the Northwest to quiet\r\nthe first Riel rebellion, which occurred about this time, and who\r\nlived, at this period, at 172 Havelock Terrace, Mountain Street,\r\nabove the Canadian Pacific Railway bridge. Another was General\r\nWindham, who was buried in this city on February 12, 1870.\r\n\r\nOne of the acts of the young Prince was to open the Caledonia\r\nskating rink on December 15th. A photograph of this represents\r\nthe Prince surrounded by such men as David Brown, A. McGibbon,\r\nF. Gardner, Colonel Lord Russell, Mr. Hugh Allan, Mr. Andrew\r\nAllan, Colonel Dyde, H. Hutchinson, the architect, and the Rev.\r\nDr. Robert Campbell. During his stay the Prince also opened the\r\nRoyal Arthur School on Workman Street, and conferred in the St.\r\nPatrick’s Hall the order of St. Michael and St. George on Mr.\r\nA.T. Galt,--a striking and unusual ceremony in those days.\r\n\r\nThe Sixth Art Exhibition was held in Montreal the next year on\r\nMarch 8th and Prince Arthur was present.\r\n\r\nThe young Prince had more functions for he was soon to accompany\r\nhis regiment in repelling the second Fenian raid.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, about April 10, 1870, an intimation having been\r\nreceived by the Dominion Government, from the British Minister\r\nat Washington, of an intended Fenian raid into Canada, several\r\nfrontier corps were ordered to hold themselves in readiness for\r\nimmediate action. There was great military enthusiasm in the\r\ncity and by the end of the week all the battalions so ordered\r\nwere under arms. From Montreal, on the Monday following the\r\nreceipt of this information, Muir’s troop of cavalry was ordered\r\nout and they arrived at Huntingdon on Tuesday afternoon, whither\r\nalso went Prince Arthur. Colonel Chamberlain had already gone\r\nto Missisquoi to bring out the force under his command, whilst\r\na large force of the volunteers in Montreal was collected under\r\nLieutenant-Colonel Fletcher, the entire force being under Colonel\r\nLowry.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FUNERAL OF THOMAS D’ARCY McGEE]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FUNERAL OF THE LATE T.L. HACKETT AS SEEN COMING\r\nDOWN ST. JAMES STREET]\r\n\r\nThe volunteer movement received an impetus and recruiting was\r\nlively. During the following week the streets of Montreal\r\nappeared gay with marching troops and sounds of martial music\r\nfrom the many bands which were moving to and from the execution\r\nof their military duties, now vividly recalled by the citizens of\r\nthat time who have lived to see the great call to arms of 1914.\r\n\r\nThe day after the Queen’s Birthday, May 25th, the band of 200\r\nof these, misguided Fenians, under command of “General” O’Neil,\r\ncrossed the frontier and entered Canada, trying to effect a\r\nlodgment at Pigeon Hill. A finely equipped little army of itself\r\nin the shape of the Prince Consort’s Own Rifles (Regulars), 700\r\nstrong under command of Lord A. Russell and accompanied by our\r\npresent Governor-General, then Prince Arthur, went by special\r\ntrain to St. Johns, where the volunteers had preceded them.\r\n\r\nGeneral Lindsay assumed command of the whole. The only fighting\r\nthat occurred was at Cook’s Corners, where the whole of the\r\nCanadian troops did not exceed seventy men, though ample reserves\r\nwere in waiting at points near at hand. The actual fighting was\r\nof no importance; it was a flash in the pan that made a great\r\nscare.\r\n\r\nOn May 26th President Grant issued a proclamation against Fenian\r\nraids into Canada and on May 30th in Montreal the mayor thanked\r\nthe volunteers for their services. Little had had to be done but\r\nit was serious work mobilizing and there was much activity over\r\nthe city in preparation.\r\n\r\nSeveral other events are to be recorded for this year, the\r\nappearance of the Tyne Crew and the meeting to form the Dominion\r\nBoard of Trade. The Frazer Institute was incorporated in 1870 and\r\nopened to the public in 1885 after a long delay from litigious\r\nactions. This year the “silver” nuisance was lessened by the\r\nexport of $4,000,000 at a cost of $140,000, through the adoption\r\nof the plan of Sir Francis Hincks and Mr. William Weir, afterward\r\npresident of the Ville Marie Bank.\r\n\r\nIn 1871 the first post cards issued by the Dominion postoffice\r\nwere welcomed in the city. In this year the fuller organization\r\nof the Canadian Pacific Railway, organized by Montreal men, took\r\nplace and the preliminary surveys were made for which Parliament\r\nhad in 1870 appropriated $250,000.\r\n\r\nOn February 27, 1872, loyal Montreal observed the day as one of\r\nthanksgiving for the recovery of the Prince of Wales. On April\r\n27th the intense interest of Montrealers in the new railway\r\nculminated in the voting on the million dollar railway subsidy.\r\nOctober 2d of this year saw St. Patrick’s Hall burned down; a\r\nrun on the City and District Bank on the 7th, which was stopped\r\nby a citizen’s large deposit and by the timely advice of the\r\nRev. Father Dowd, the pastor of St. Patrick’s parish; and on the\r\n17th the city cars, then horse drawn, were stopped, owing to the\r\nanimals suffering from the epizooty. This year was marked by the\r\nestablishment of the first cotton mill at Hochelaga.\r\n\r\nThe memorable events of 1873 include the obtaining of the charter\r\nof the Canadian Pacific Railway, the public funeral in Montreal,\r\non June 13th, of Sir George Etienne Cartier, who died in London\r\non May 20th at the age of fifty-nine years, the unveiling of the\r\nstatue of Queen Victoria by Lord Dufferin and the opening of the\r\nWesleyan Theological College and the new Y.M.C.A. building.\r\n\r\nIn 1874 the manifesto of the Canada First party was issued on\r\nJanuary 6th, preceding the general elections of January 29th.\r\n\r\nIn March the Queen’s Hall, the home of concerts and theatrical\r\nentertainments, was burnt down.\r\n\r\nIn September, 1875, the reinterment of Guibord in the Catholic\r\ncemetery took place under military escort.\r\n\r\nOn May 26th an act was passed that introduced vote by ballot,\r\nsimultaneous elections, the abolition of property qualifications\r\nfor members of the House of Commons and stringent enactments\r\nagainst corrupt practices at elections. On June 6, 1876, the\r\nEmperor and Empress of Brazil were entertained in this city.\r\n\r\nThis year was chiefly noticeable for trade depression and the\r\nnumber of business failures. This was in consequence of the bad\r\ntimes begun in 1874. On August 14th a great mass meeting was\r\ncalled to consider the Montreal taxes. The country was in a poor\r\nstate after the abrogation of the reciprocity treaty with the\r\nUnited States and was suffering from the reaction after the Civil\r\nwar.\r\n\r\nIn 1875 the Mechanics Bank and the Banque Jacques Cartier\r\nsuspended payment. The industries were very few and could not\r\ncompete with those of the States, and agriculture was feeble.\r\nThere were heavy duties to pay for the many goods coming from\r\nthe States. There was little population and many crossed the\r\nborder line. Work was scarce; there was great distress. People\r\nwere starving and free public soup kitchens were established for\r\npoor relief by the charitable agencies. Funds were too low for\r\nmore liberal treatment. Politicians placed the blame on the free\r\ntrade policy of Mr. McKenzie’s party then in power. This was\r\nopposed to the genius and the needs of a young country feeling\r\nits industrial way. While the Americans had a duty at that time\r\nof twenty to seventy per cent the Canadians for purely revenue\r\npurposes had only something like fifteen per cent, and nothing\r\nfor protection. The occasion was one that demanded practical\r\nrelief and not finely strung political theories, built on the\r\nexperience of the custom prevailing in England. But nothing was\r\ndone so that the people became hopeless and gloomy and there was\r\na project about this time, as already recorded, for annexation,\r\nencouraged by the American party in Montreal for business reasons.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the city saw, in June and July, of 1878, the Orange\r\ntroubles and the shooting of Hackett, a state of excitement no\r\ndoubt caused by the general unsettled state of affairs. The\r\ngreat hope of this time was the national policy which Sir John\r\nA. Macdonald began to make public. The effect was magical at\r\nthe start. In March, 1878, he expressed his opinion that to\r\nbe prosperous Canada must adopt a “national policy” for the\r\nprotection of home industries. It had to be fought out at the\r\npolls. There was now hope in every breast. Financial men began\r\nto look out for sites upon which to build mills and factories,\r\nthe sugar refineries were reopened, the people took heart and\r\nwhen the policy carried at the polls in September by a tremendous\r\nmajority and was ratified by a formal vote in the house, and when\r\nthe national policy was introduced March 14, 1879, going into\r\neffect next day, it was felt that Montreal and Canada were saved.\r\nIt was the remembrance of this that caused the older men to vote\r\nagainst reciprocity when before the public in 1911.\r\n\r\nA social event of this year was the investiture by the Marquis of\r\nLorne, Governor-General of Canada, authorized by Her Majesty, of\r\nthe six knights of the most distinguished Order of St. Michael\r\nand St. Gregory.\r\n\r\nOn January 1, 1880, the South Eastern Railway began the\r\nconstruction of a railway across the ice from the north side of\r\nthe river to the station between Bellerive Park and Longueuil\r\nFerry, across to Longueuil. The contractors were Auguste Laberge\r\n& Son, who had built the city hall, its promoters being Mr.\r\nSénecal, A.B. Foster, Judge Mousseau, J.B. Renaud and others. On\r\nthe 29th of January loaded cars were drawn across to Montreal.\r\nNext day an engine of 50,000 pounds avoirdupois crossed from\r\nMontreal. On March 15th horses replaced the engines; on March\r\n31st twenty cars were on the ice railway, when it began to be\r\nfound insecure so that the rails were removed from the ice on\r\nApril 1st.\r\n\r\nIn September the Governor General visited the exhibition at\r\nMontreal, when 50,000 persons were present.\r\n\r\nOn October 1st the contract was signed for the Canadian Pacific\r\nRailway, but at midnight on December 10th it was placed before\r\nthe House. On February 16th of the next year the company received\r\nits letters patent and on May 2d broke the first ground for the\r\ngreat transcontinental railway.\r\n\r\nOn December 23d of this year Sarah Bernhardt made her first\r\nappearance here.\r\n\r\nOn January 5th, 1881, the South Eastern Railway laid a railway\r\nagain across the ice but it was shortly abandoned on the loss of\r\nan engine by the freight train breaking through, without the loss\r\nof life.\r\n\r\nThe next year, 1882, was one of intellectual progress in the city\r\nfor this year, on May 25th, the Royal Society of Montreal was\r\nformed with Sir William Dawson, principal of McGill, as president.\r\n\r\nOn August 21st there were the meetings of the Forestry and\r\nAgricultural congresses and on August 23d the American\r\nAssociation for the Advancement of Learning again chose the city\r\nfor its convention after twenty-four years’ absence.\r\n\r\nThe first Montreal Winter Carnival was held in January, 1883,\r\nand was the outgrowth of a suggestion by Mr. R.D. McGibbon, an\r\nadvocate of the city. One of the great features was the ice\r\npalace, which was erected in Dominion Square, a mediaeval castle\r\nof transparent crystal. The attack of 2,000 snowshoers, and the\r\ndefence by the volunteers, was a great scene amid the detonation\r\nof bombshells and the interchange of pyrotechnic missles till\r\nat last the castle capitulated. After this an immense line of\r\nshowshoers, each bearing aloft a blazing torch, scaled the\r\nmountain in a seemingly endless trail of fire. This has been\r\nrepeated at more or less regular intervals but the fear that the\r\nice palace would harm prospective immigrants through unnecessary\r\nfear of our bright, brisk and invigorating winter has caused the\r\ncarnival pageant to fall into desuetude. Yet the carnival is but\r\na development of the old frost fairs on the Thames, that most\r\nknown being on the occasion of the visit of Charles II and the\r\nRoyal Family to the Frost Fair of 1684, when the printers made a\r\nsouvenir as follows:\r\n\r\n             Charles,   King       Mary,   Duchess\r\n             James,     Duke       Anne,   Princess\r\n             Katherine, Queen      George, Prince\r\n                         Hans in Kilder\r\n      London, printed by J. Croome on the ice on the River\r\n                    Thames, Jan. 31st, 1684.\r\n\r\nThe month of June, 1884, was the scene of great festivity among\r\nthe French-Canadian population on the occasion of the fiftieth\r\nanniversary of the foundation of the parent society of St.\r\nJean Baptiste Association of Montreal, being taken to hold a\r\nnational congress of French-Canadians from June 24th to the 28th,\r\nto inaugurate the placing of the first stone of the Edifice\r\nNationale, which afterwards became the “Monument National.”\r\nOutside of the literary, artistic and other intellectual sessions\r\nof the congress there were public sports, balloon ascensions and\r\namusements, and a great procession of all the societies of St.\r\nJean Baptiste in Canada and the United States, when a magnificent\r\narray of allegorical cars representing the chief features of\r\nCanadian history passed through the principal streets of the city.\r\n\r\nIn addition there was a grand historical cavalcade representing\r\nSt. Louis, King of France, receiving the oriflamme of St. Denis\r\nand departing for the Seventh Crusade. The dresses for this\r\ndignified cavalcade cost about ten thousand dollars and the whole\r\nspectacle was one that far surpassed any similar dramatic pageant\r\nthat had preceded it or has followed since in Canada.\r\n\r\nOn January 1, 1884, the River St. Lawrence again notably flooded\r\nthe lower part of Montreal as was usual in the spring.\r\n\r\nOn July 4, 1884, Louis Riel arrived at Duck Lake and began to\r\ninflame the discontent in the half-breeds and Indians, who feared\r\ndispossession of their lands by the incoming settlers and the\r\nencroachment of the iron road of the Canadian Pacific Railroad.\r\nThis, together with the Soudan war then in progress, produced a\r\nrevival of the military spirit so that in the following year,\r\n1885, Montreal sent the Sixty-fifth Regiment to suppress the\r\nrebellion.\r\n\r\nThe Montreal contingent returned home at a critical juncture\r\nand was employed to quell the anti-vaccination riots of 1885.\r\nAt this time a virulent epidemic of smallpox had broken out in\r\nthe city and a compulsory vaccination act had been passed which\r\nwas resented by a great portion of the people, many complaining\r\nthat the vaccine used had poisoned them, while others complained\r\non sentimental and medical grounds. It was a time of terror.\r\nMobs attacked the houses and even the persons of Larocque, Drs.\r\nE. Persillier-Lachapelle, J.W. Mount, Hingston, and others, who\r\nwere before the public as the chief promoters of the vaccination\r\nmovement. Meanwhile the doctors appointed for each district had\r\ntheir stations and went from door to door to vaccinate, while the\r\nhouses could be seen with their isolation papers posted on them\r\nand with guards around and the yellow ambulances plying through\r\nthe streets, taking away the affected sick or the dead.\r\n\r\nThe friends of many of the victims refused to allow the patients\r\nto be removed to the Exhibition grounds where a temporary\r\nhospital had been arranged. All the local troops were called out.\r\nThe cavalry was there, too. A tremendous mob assembled at Mount\r\nRoyal and attacked it with stones. Many of the men received cuts\r\nin the face. When the mob was at its worst, it was discovered\r\nthat there was no magistrate to read the riot act, and no\r\nammunition for the rifles, in case the rifles had to be used.\r\nHowever, the cavalry rode through the crowds. A better feeling\r\nfinally prevailed, so that the patients were peaceably allowed to\r\nbe taken to the public hospital.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WINTER SPORTS IN MONTREAL: Skiing]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WINTER SPORTS IN MONTREAL: Snow shoeing]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WINTER SPORTS IN MONTREAL: The Ice Palace]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WINTER SPORTS IN MONTREAL: Hockey match at\r\nVictoria Rink]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WINTER SPORTS IN MONTREAL: Toboggan slide on\r\nMount Royal]\r\n\r\nThe epidemic had important results in the effect it had on the\r\nmodernizing and reconstruction of the medical bureau of the city\r\nhall.\r\n\r\nThe Montreal annals of 1886 for January 2d recall the meetings\r\nof the famous evangelist, D.L. Moody. In the same month Sir John\r\nA. MacDonald, while in England, defended French-Canadian loyalty\r\nand affirmed at the same time that 40,000 of the best soldiers in\r\nCanada were ready to leave to defend Imperial interests in Burmah\r\nor Turkestan.\r\n\r\nThis year was signalized by Montreal’s worst inundation, so\r\nthat on April 17th from the foot of Beaver Hall Hill there was\r\na 5 cent ferry by boat and carts to St. James Street. The flood\r\nabated on April 20th, after having been five feet, ten inches\r\nabove the revetment wall. A similar flood occurred next year and\r\na delegation went to Ottawa to arrange with the Government for\r\nadequate protection. In consequence the following year a wooden\r\nembankment, filled with cement, was built and pumping stations\r\nwere erected to protect Montreal from further inundations. This\r\nrevetment wall, however, gave place to the present one of stone.\r\n\r\nOn the 28th of June the first passenger train to the Pacific left\r\nthe city, reaching Vancouver on July 4th, a distance of 2,906\r\nmiles having been covered in 140 hours.\r\n\r\nOn May 12, 1888, the Quebec Parliament passed the Jesuits’\r\nestates bill.\r\n\r\nOn September 3d the first labour day was celebrated in the city,\r\n5,000 taking part in the procession.\r\n\r\nDuring the next year, 1889, the Jesuits’ bill was contested by\r\nthe Equal Rights party; finally the Quebec Legislature paid\r\nthe Jesuits $400,000 which was further divided among Catholic\r\neducational bodies and an additional sum of $60,000 was turned\r\nover to the Protestant Board of Education.\r\n\r\nThe year 1890 opened with la grippe which was then prevalent in\r\nthe United States, Canada and Europe.\r\n\r\nOn May 6th the lunatic asylum at Longue Pointe was burnt down\r\nwith the loss of seventy lives, owing to the incendiarism of a\r\npatient.\r\n\r\nThis year saw the reception of the Comte de Paris and his son.\r\nThe reception tendered them was a brilliant affair. Not only\r\nthe French population but the English also received them most\r\nroyally, although a counter demonstration was started by a few\r\nrevolutionary spirits, but they had no following and their\r\nefforts came to nothing.\r\n\r\nThe annals of 1891 recall the arrival in the city, on August\r\n21st, of the Continental Guards from New Orleans.\r\n\r\nOn September 8th there was the first electrical convention and\r\nthis was followed on September 18th by the Montreal Exhibition,\r\nwhich took place on the former Guilbeault’s zoological and\r\npleasure grounds above Mount Royal Avenue, these having been\r\nmoved from the first location on Sherbrooke Street, the\r\nattendance at the exhibition being 50,000, surpassing those of\r\n1880, 1881, 1883 and 1884.\r\n\r\nLovers of the antiquities of the city will note the date of\r\nOctober 21st, as that of the historic tablets being unveiled\r\nunder the auspices of the Numismatic and Antiquarian Society\r\nof Montreal, the movement having been promoted by Messrs. W.D.\r\nLighthall with the aid of A.U. Beaudry, Gerald Hart and others of\r\na subsequent committee.\r\n\r\nThe fifth jubilee of the founding of Montreal occurred in 1892.\r\nAs early as April 17, 1888, a resolution was passed by the above\r\nassociation to celebrate it by an international exhibition\r\nin 1892. In October of 1888, Mr. Roswell Corse Lyman, one of\r\nits members, wrote a pamphlet “Shall we have a World’s Fair\r\nin Montreal in 1892 to celebrate the two hundred and fiftieth\r\nanniversary of the founding of Ville Marie?” It never eventuated\r\nin this city, but Montreal can rightly claim that through this\r\npamphlet and the Montreal initiation the wonderful Chicago\r\nWorld’s Fair of 1893 had its origin.\r\n\r\nIn April many Jewish families left Montreal to colonize the\r\nNorthwest.\r\n\r\nApril of 1893 opened with three incendiary fires and on April 3d\r\nBonsecours Market was partially burnt with a loss of $20,000,\r\nwithout insurance. On May 18th the cornerstone of the new Board\r\nof Trade Building was laid by Sir Donald Smith, who humorously\r\nremarked that he had come down from Ottawa as a common labourer,\r\nbut that his brother member of Parliament, Mr. J.J. Curran,\r\nafterward the Hon. Mr. Justice Curran, had come to make a\r\nspeech. On May 28th the will of Mr. J.W. Tempest was published,\r\nbequeathing the Art Association of Montreal about $80,000. One of\r\nthe first benefactors to this had been Mr. Benajah Gibb, a former\r\ncitizen.\r\n\r\nAt the second congress of the Chambers of Commerce of the Empire,\r\nheld in London from June 28th to July 1st, the Montreal Board\r\nof Trade was represented by Mr. Donald A. Smith and Mr. Peter\r\nRedpath.\r\n\r\nOn July 5th, Sir William Dawson welcomed the Teachers’\r\nAssociation to the city.\r\n\r\nThis year the street railway of Montreal was electrified and city\r\nplanners saw the beginning of the present leap in the growth of\r\nMontreal through its suburbs following on the annexations which\r\nbegan in 1883.\r\n\r\nOn July 19th the city granted a thirty years’ franchise to the\r\nStreet Railway Company.\r\n\r\nIn 1893 the progress of McGill University since 1852 was made\r\nmanifest. University life was enlivened in this city on January\r\n20th, when the students of the universities of Vermont and\r\nMcGill held a joint concert in the city. At this time McGill\r\nhad sixty-six professors. In April the chairs of pathology and\r\nhygiene were founded by the chancellor, Sir Donald A. Smith.\r\nMcGill was benefited this year by the addition of the engineering\r\nand physics building, the gift of (Sir) William C. Macdonald, by\r\nthe workshops, the gift of Thomas Workman, the library, by Peter\r\nRedpath, and the new Aberdeen medal, given by the new Governor\r\nGeneral, Lord Aberdeen. But in the midst of the triumphs of this\r\nyear, McGill regretfully received the resignation of Sir William\r\nDawson, whom it had received as its principal in 1852, the year\r\nof its second lease of life.\r\n\r\nOn February 23d the International Mining Association met in\r\nMontreal.\r\n\r\nOn April 24, 1893, the interest of Montrealers in Imperial\r\npolitics was manifested by the telegram of St. Patrick’s Society\r\nto the Canadian statesman, the Hon. E.S. Blake, a member of\r\nParliament for an English constituency, to congratulate Mr.\r\nGladstone and himself on the second reading of the Home Rule bill.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A GROUP OF MONTREAL RESIDENCES]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Residence of Sir William C. Van Horne]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Residence of the Hon. Dr. James J. Guerin,\r\nEx-Mayor of Montreal]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: “Ravenscrag,” residence of Sir Hugh Montagu Allan]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Montreal residence of Lord Strathcona and Mount\r\nRoyal]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Residence of the late Hon. Sir William Hales\r\nHingston]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Residence of the late Charles M. Hays, Esq.]\r\n\r\nOn May 1st there was held the first meeting of the Corn Exchange\r\nin its newly erected building. On the 23d Montreal was visited\r\nby the tornado which passed over the province, but without much\r\ninjury or death.\r\n\r\nOn June 8th, Villa Maria, belonging to the “Congregation”\r\nSisters, one of the largest educational structures on the\r\nAmerican continent, was destroyed by fire.\r\n\r\nOn June 19th the three caravels, intended as the facsimiles of\r\nthe ships of Columbus, were at Montreal on their way to the\r\nWorld’s Fair at Chicago. In the summer of 1914 one of them, the\r\nSanta Maria, reappeared at Montreal on a long tour in preparation\r\nfor the Panama Exhibition at San Francisco in 1915.\r\n\r\nThe harbour also saw in July the arrival of the warship Etna.\r\nJuly witnessed a great convention of many thousands of an\r\nunsectarian body named the Christian Endeavourers. This year\r\nthe railways of Montreal were flourishing and the fact that\r\n132 trains were daily entering by the Canadian Pacific and\r\nGrand Trunk railways show the steady growth of the population\r\nand commerce. The earnings of the Canadian Pacific Railway had\r\nincreased by almost five million dollars since 1887.\r\n\r\nOn October 30th the city mourned the loss by death of a great\r\nMontrealer, the late Sir John Joseph Caldwell Abbott, K. C, M.G.,\r\na former mayor of the city and a prime minister of Canada. His\r\nburial took place on November 2d and his remains were followed\r\nby his successor, Sir John Thompson, and by many hundreds of the\r\nleaders of Canada.\r\n\r\nThe most important event closing the year of 1893 was the\r\ninauguration of the Royal Victoria Hospital in honour of Her\r\nMajesty, Queen Victoria.\r\n\r\nOn November 27th, Montreal experienced a shock of earthquake\r\nwhich was felt over Canada with no loss of life and little of\r\nproperty.\r\n\r\nIn 1894, Sir William Van Horne, the president of the Canadian\r\nPacific Railway, and one of its pioneers, was knighted.\r\n\r\nThis year closed on December 31st with one of the greatest\r\nwindstorms ever recorded in the history of Montreal, the velocity\r\nof the wind reaching eighty miles per hour, so that much damage\r\nwas done.\r\n\r\nIn 1894, the first attempt towards a public portrait gallery,\r\na museum of antiquities and the securing of the Château de\r\nRamezay as its permanent home originated with the members of the\r\nAntiquarian Society of Montreal, the idea of the picture gallery\r\narising with Mr. de Léry MacDonald, that of saving the Château\r\nfrom passing into private hands, with Mr. Roswell Lyman, and\r\nthe employment of it as a public historical museum by Mr. W.D.\r\nLighthall, which was promoted by a petition to the mayor and\r\naldermen organized by Mr. R.W. McLachlan and others and signed\r\nby about three thousand principal citizens. The agitation was\r\nsuccessful and the first reception was given in the Château de\r\nRamezay on November 11, 1897.\r\n\r\nThe next year, 1895, was marked with the inauguration of other\r\npublic movements. On June 6th the statue of Sir John A. MacDonald\r\nwas unveiled in Dominion Square by Sir Donald A. Smith and the\r\nMaisonneuve monument by Phillipe Hébert was unveiled on the\r\nPlace d’Armes on Monday, July 1st, by the Hon. J.A. Chapleau,\r\nlieutenant governor of the Province of Quebec, the president of\r\nthe committee being M.S. Pagnuelo and the secretary being the\r\nVicomte H. de la Barthe. This was followed on October 8th by the\r\ninauguration of the new edifice of the Montreal branch of Laval\r\nUniversity, but recently established in the city.\r\n\r\nIn 1896, Sir Donald A. Smith, later Lord Strathcona, was\r\nappointed High Commissioner for Canada. Another prominent\r\nMontreal citizen, Mr. Charles M. Hays, was appointed general\r\nmanager of the Grand Trunk Railway.\r\n\r\nAmong the notable city events of 1897 were the meeting, in\r\nMontreal, of the Behring Sea Commissioners on June 16th, the\r\ncelebration of the first day of Queen Victoria’s Diamond Jubilee,\r\nthe consecration on June 30th of His Grace, Archbishop Bruchesi,\r\nby the Apostolic delegate, Mgr. Merry del Val, and the great\r\nmeeting of the British Medical Society on August 31st.\r\n\r\nIn 1898 the public benefactions of a notable citizen, Sir William\r\nC. MacDonald, were rewarded by a knighthood.\r\n\r\nJanuary 1, 1899, is memorable as the day when the reduction of\r\nthe 3 cent postage stamp to 2 cents came into force.\r\n\r\nThis year also marked the progress of the movement for the\r\nhigher education of women by the opening of the Royal Victoria\r\nCollege for Women, being endowed with a gift of $1,000,000 by the\r\nchancellor of the University of McGill, Lord Strathcona.\r\n\r\nThis year being that of the beginning of the Boer war, Montreal\r\nagain shared in the Imperial burden by providing a considerable\r\npart of the Canadian contingents for service in South Africa,\r\nit being represented in the first contingent by Company E,\r\nwhich sailed on October 30, 1899, and more largely in the\r\nsecond contingent which departed on January 4, 1900. The famous\r\nStrathcona Horse of three squadrons with 597 of all ranks sailed\r\non March 1, 1900. During the progress of the war the citizens\r\nwere actively engaged in promoting the patriotic fund and in\r\nworks of providing comforts for the soldiers and those left\r\nbehind by them.\r\n\r\nDuring the course of 1900 the statue of Queen Victoria by\r\nPrincess Louise was unveiled by the Governor General, Lord Minto.\r\n\r\nThe year 1901 was ushered in by the disastrous fire which\r\ndestroyed the Board of Trade and many other commercial buildings\r\non St. Paul Street to the extent of $2,500,000 loss. The new\r\nbuilding was raised on the same site and was taken possession of\r\non May 1, 1903.\r\n\r\nOn September 18, 1902, Montreal was honoured by the royal\r\nvisit of the Duke and Duchess of Cornwall, who are now happily\r\nreigning as King George V and Queen Mary. The loyalty of the\r\ncity was manifested as on previous royal visits, the city being\r\nmagnificently decorated and illuminated.\r\n\r\nThe growing importance of Montreal as a factor in Imperial\r\ncommerce was demonstrated in the following year, 1903, when the\r\nChambers of Commerce of the Empire met in the city.\r\n\r\nThe destruction by fire of the Mount Royal Club, frequented by\r\nthe wealthiest and most important citizens, taking place this\r\nyear is another sidelight calling attention to the growth of\r\nclub life since the old Beaver Club days. Other clubs had, in\r\nthe meantime, been established in great numbers to cope with the\r\ngrowth of its needs.\r\n\r\nIn 1905 the first turbine steamers to cross the Atlantic, the\r\nVirginian and Victorian, of the Allan Line, were placed on the\r\nSt. Lawrence route, a fact showing that navigation methods at\r\nMontreal have always kept abreast with the times. This same year\r\nthe value of new buildings erected was $5,590,698.\r\n\r\nThe year 1904 opened with a terrible conflagration at St.\r\nCunégonde on January 18th.\r\n\r\nOn June 4th, Lord Dundonald, on military service in Canada, made\r\nhis famous arraignment at the Windsor Hotel of his government,\r\nfor which he was recalled on June 14th. The harbour this year\r\nshowed the prevalent great commercial development when an\r\nelevator capable of holding 1,000,000 bushels was erected. On the\r\n22d of August the Manufacturers’ Association held a great banquet\r\nat the Windsor Hotel. In November, Patti made her last appearance\r\nin the city to be followed on January 5, 1905, by Rejanne, both\r\nof these latter appearances chronicling the position of Montreal\r\nas a musical and dramatic centre. Since then great singers, such\r\nas Calvé, Albani, Caruso and others have each triumphed here, as\r\nhave the leading instrumental artists.\r\n\r\nThe Russo-Japanese war was the occasion of a subscription for\r\na Japanese loan being started on March 31st. On August 22d\r\nRoyalty again visited Montreal in the person of Prince Louis of\r\nBattenberg.\r\n\r\nIn 1906 the Labour party in Montreal elected a labour\r\nrepresentative, M. Alphonse Verville, for Maisonneuve. This year\r\nSt. Helen’s Island was secured for the people of Montreal by a\r\npurchase by the city from the Federal Government for $200,000.\r\n\r\nIn this year the advent of the automobile era is recorded at\r\nMontreal by the first fatality occurring, on August 11th, in the\r\ndeath of one named Toutant.\r\n\r\nIn 1907 the early months saw the burning of the Protestant school\r\nat Hochelaga and the civil engineering and medical buildings of\r\nMcGill University. On April 1st the old Theatre Royal, which had\r\nfallen from the high palmy days into flagrant spectacles of a low\r\nclass of vaudeville, was interdicted by the Archbishop Bruchesi\r\nand its final doom occurred a few years later.\r\n\r\nThe Bremen, one of the first German cruisers to visit this port,\r\narrived on August 25, 1907. A significant sidelight of a phase\r\nof the continued growth of Montreal is the signing, on November\r\n7th, of the contract for the building of the new city prison at\r\nBordeaux. This year the temperance movement was greatly forwarded\r\nby the foundation of the Anti-Alcoolique League on December 29th.\r\n\r\nInternational trade expansion was demonstrated in Montreal on\r\nFebruary 5th, when the Marconi commercial telegraph service was\r\ninstalled.\r\n\r\nThe eclipse of the sun of 1908 was visible at Montreal on July\r\n22d.\r\n\r\nIn 1909 a great accident took place in the Windsor Station by\r\na train running off the tracks causing damage to the extent of\r\n$200,000, but with the loss, however, of only four lives.\r\n\r\nThe shipping in the port this year was increased by the advent\r\nof the White Star Liners, S.S. Laurentic on May 7th, and S.S.\r\nMegantic on June 27th. On the 27th of August the steamship\r\nPrescott was burnt in the harbour. The “Back to Montreal”\r\nmovement recalled citizens to their homes for the week beginning\r\nSeptember 13th, while the following day saw the closing of the\r\ncivic investigation into aldermanic scandals at the city hall to\r\nbe followed by the “Cannon Report.”\r\n\r\nOn September 23d the Witness Building was gutted by fire. In\r\nOctober the Royal Edward Tuberculosis Institute, the first of\r\nits kind in Canada, was opened by telegraph from England by His\r\nMajesty, King Edward, who gave the name to the building. The last\r\nday of the year ended with a gas explosion at Viger Station with\r\nthe loss of thirty-eight lives.\r\n\r\nThe year 1910 is memorable for the triumph of civic reform and\r\nthe establishment of the Board of Control, owing to a change in\r\nthe city charter, as the outcome of the referendum to the people\r\nin 1909, to stop which an aldermanic delegation to the Provincial\r\nLegislature had been fruitless.\r\n\r\nIn the year in question the electors were asked to vote on these\r\ntwo vital questions:\r\n\r\nDo you approve of the creation of a Board of Control?\r\n\r\nDo you approve of one alderman a ward instead of two?\r\n\r\nThe answer given to both of the queries was overwhelmingly in the\r\naffirmative. The following figures prove this beyond the question\r\nof a doubt:\r\n\r\n           SUMMARY OF THE VOTE\r\n\r\n                                   Votes.\r\n\r\n  For reduction of aldermen        19,585\r\n  Against reduction                 1,640\r\n                                   ------\r\n      Majority in favor            17,945\r\n\r\n  For Board of Control             18,528\r\n  Against Board of Control          2,413\r\n                                   ------\r\n      Majority in favor            16,115\r\n\r\nThere was not a single ward, throughout the city, which did not\r\nfavour the proposed changes and no less than 34 per cent of the\r\nentire vote was polled on this memorable occasion.\r\n\r\nOn May 6th, His Majesty, King Edward, died and loyal Montreal\r\ngrieved as a city with majestic and magnificent emblems of\r\nsorrow over all the public buildings. On the occasion of the\r\nroyal funeral in Westminster Abbey the city was represented\r\nby His Worship the mayor, Dr. J.J. Guerin. In preparation for\r\nthis event the high commissioner of Canada, Lord Strathcona, in\r\nLondon, protested against the inferior position given to the\r\nrepresentatives of autonomous colonies of the Empire and his\r\ntimely intervention was generously acted upon.\r\n\r\nThe Montreal trade fleet again was reinforced in 1910 by the\r\nadvent on May 11th of the Royal Edward from Bristol, the first\r\nof the Canadian Northern Railway steamers. On the 28th, of the\r\nsame month, transportation was effected by the inauguration of\r\nthe electric tramway between Longueuil and McGill streets via the\r\nVictoria Bridge.\r\n\r\nIn June the Herald Building, facing Victoria Square was destroyed\r\nby fire with the loss of thirty-three lives. During this month\r\nM. de Lesseps, of aviation fame, was received in the city hall,\r\nwhile on November 27th the city was visited by the Marquis de\r\nMontcalm, a name honoured in the city from the general who made\r\nMontreal his headquarters under the French régime.\r\n\r\nIn October a flight, however, has to be recorded--that of the\r\nplausible financial gambler, Sheldon, who had ruined many widows\r\namong his dupes. He was, however, captured in the following year\r\nand sentenced to five years’ imprisonment.\r\n\r\nBut the Eucharistic Congress of 1910, held in Montreal, at the\r\nchoice of the Catholic world, was an event before which all\r\nothers of a social character have paled during recent years.\r\nIt was prepared for long in advance as a great civic occasion,\r\nirrespective of its denominational character. The railway and\r\nsteamship companies, the civic authorities and public bodies\r\nfitly put forth all their strength to make Montreal realize its\r\nnow acknowledged position as a world city, which its choice\r\nconnoted.\r\n\r\n  All was in readiness when Cardinal Vincenzo Vannutelli, at\r\n  the end of August, came to Quebec on the Empress of Britain,\r\n  to represent His Holiness, Pius X. There in the old City of\r\n  Champlain the eminent visitor was honourably and worthily\r\n  entertained. After this the Government tugboat, the Lady Grey,\r\n  and the Government steamboat Montmagny, with prominent members\r\n  of the legislature and leading citizens, accompanied by other\r\n  vessels, eighty yachts, motor boats, etc., went down to meet the\r\n  delegate on the way up the river. Meanwhile great crowds were\r\n  gathered to receive the party on the wharf, but the flotilla\r\n  entered the port on Saturday afternoon, September 3d, in a\r\n  downpour of torrential rain. At the foot of McGill Street, on\r\n  the wharf, a splendid kiosk, topped with a handsome cupola,\r\n  was crowded with the civic functionaries, who shortly left on\r\n  receiving the Cardinal and the whole party were forced to adjourn\r\n  to the city hall, where the ceremony of further reception by the\r\n  mayor, Dr. James J. Guerin, was more worthily and comfortably\r\n  performed. The rain, however, had not prevented the ringing\r\n  of church bells and the shrill whistling of half a hundred\r\n  steamships and numerous factories and the crowds of the expectant\r\n  citizens from voicing a welcome. From the city hall, the Papal\r\n  representative proceeded to the residence of Archbishop Bruchesi,\r\n  who had organized the congress, to be held in Montreal, the first\r\n  place in the new world to be so honoured by this national event,\r\n  a sign of the growing recognition of the place of Montreal in the\r\n  cities of the world. The Archbishop’s house was to be the home of\r\n  the Minister for the week.\r\n\r\n  On Tuesday evening the formal opening of the congress took\r\n  place in St. James’ Church on Dominion Square, amid picturesque\r\n  religious ceremonies and brilliant ecclesiastical functions that\r\n  surpassed anything previous on this continent. The delegate\r\n  opened his remarks by a recognition of the enthusiastic reception\r\n  given him by the provincial and municipal authorities, as well as\r\n  by all classes. Archbishop Bruchesi, in his address of welcome,\r\n  recognized the kindly feelings which other creeds had manifested\r\n  towards the congress, how many prominent non-Catholic citizens,\r\n  such as Lord Strathcona, had given their help in various\r\n  practical ways in demonstrations of a high spiritual belief\r\n  in the Unseen which the congress portended for all. Various\r\n  telegrams were sent to Pius X at Rome and to George V in London\r\n  expressing gratitude for the recent modification made by him in\r\n  the form of the royal declaration which had continued till then\r\n  to contain obsolete and obnoxious discriminations against a loyal\r\n  part of his subjects.\r\n\r\n  It may also be noted here that at the luncheon given that day\r\n  at the Windsor Hotel by Sir Lomer Gouin, prime minister of the\r\n  Province of Quebec, the Cardinal, proposing the health of the\r\n  King, congratulated the Canadians on the liberty that had been\r\n  assured them under the British King who had shown how he could\r\n  respect the legitimate susceptibilities of his Roman Catholic\r\n  subjects throughout the Empire.\r\n\r\n  In the evening of this day, September 7th, the representative of\r\n  the Federal Government, the Hon. Charles Murphy, Secretary of\r\n  State of Canada, gave his official reception, which was attended\r\n  by the largest throng of citizens that ever had entered this\r\n  hotel. That night, midnight high mass was celebrated at the Notre\r\n  Dame Church, which commenced when the great bell in the west\r\n  tower, weighing 24,600 pounds, pealed out the hour of midnight,\r\n  and the files of thousands of the representatives of the secular\r\n  clergy and of the religious orders, and the laity, with prelates\r\n  of a dozen different nations, assisted at a memorable occasion.\r\n\r\n  The practical work of the congress began on Thursday, September\r\n  8th. There were thirteen sessions held in the various large halls\r\n  of the city, and in addition there were three general meetings\r\n  held, two at Notre Dame Church and one in the Arena, at which\r\n  three the Cardinal Legate presided. On two successive evenings,\r\n  September 8th and 9th, 15,000 people crowded into the great\r\n  entrance of Notre Dame to hear the most distinguished French and\r\n  English speakers of the congress. Among those who spoke were His\r\n  Eminence, Cardinal Logue, Primate of Armagh, Ireland; Archbishop\r\n  Bourne, of Westminster, England; Archbishop Ireland, of St.\r\n  Paul, Minnesota; Monsignor Heylen, of Namur; Monsignor Touchet,\r\n  of Orleans; Monsignor Rumeau, of Angers; Hon. Judge O’Sullivan,\r\n  of New York; Sir Wilfrid Laurier, Sir Lomer Gouin, the Hon.\r\n  Thomas Chapais, and the Hon. C.J. Doherty, Henri Bourassa and\r\n  J.M. Tellier, members of the federal and provincial governments\r\n  of Canada. The sacred edifice, capable of seating 15,000, was\r\n  crammed to the utmost, hundreds upon hundreds standing for two or\r\n  three hours.\r\n\r\n  The enthusiasm was intense and the sacred edifice rang with\r\n  unwonted applause. The sanctuary and the stalls were filled\r\n  with brilliant ecclesiastical costumes and gay uniforms and\r\n  the church was a mass of colour. Perhaps the most electrical\r\n  moment of the evening was after the plea of the Archbishop of\r\n  Westminster advocating, before this vast audience which was for\r\n  the most part composed of French-Canadians of the Province of\r\n  Quebec, a more general adoption of the English language to meet\r\n  the changing conditions of Greater Canada, when Henri Bourassa,\r\n  who had already been appointed to speak at this point, took the\r\n  psychological opportunity of the occasion so temptingly offered\r\n  him, to voice the aroused thoughts of his compatriots to whom\r\n  their language, religion and racial traditions seemed inseparably\r\n  bound. His words were punctuated with thundering applause and the\r\n  waving of hats and hands amid a scence of vibrant national and\r\n  religious feeling, the while the people hung upon the word of\r\n  the speaker, who for the nonce was but the mouth-piece of their\r\n  individual thoughts made a scene which the writer will never\r\n  forget as an instance of a clever orator speaking under the best\r\n  and most popular surroundings.\r\n\r\n  The third meeting, at the Arena, was composed of about eight\r\n  thousand young men who were addressed by the Cardinal,\r\n  Archbishhop Langevin, of Manitoba, and by Mr. Henri Bourassa on\r\n  “Noble Ideals and Inspirations.” Both speakers urged them to hold\r\n  to their traditions and national rights. There was plenty of room\r\n  for English and French in Canada. Both could work out a noble\r\n  destiny in this young and growing country.\r\n\r\n  Another, but one of the most appealing spectacles of the\r\n  congress, was the procession of 30,000 school children who,\r\n  wearing picturesque dresses and bearing emblems and banners,\r\n  passed constantly before the Legate who was seated on the steps\r\n  of St. James’ Cathedral and received their individual courtesy,\r\n  the while he bestowed his blessing amid the thousands of\r\n  spectators assembled around Dominion Square, the whole making a\r\n  magnificent and unusual sight lasting for three hours, during\r\n  which time all traffic in the neighbourhood was absolutely\r\n  blocked.\r\n\r\n  The historic Mount Royal has witnessed many picturesque scenes\r\n  but none more so than the great open air mass celebrated on\r\n  Saturday, September 10th, at the foot of the mountain on the\r\n  great open space below Mount Royal Avenue, where a superb and\r\n  ornate altar, open to the winds of heaven, had been placed.\r\n  Around it were 100 bishops, 2,000 priests in their picturesque\r\n  costumes, and 200,000 of the faithful. A choir of 1,000 voices\r\n  responded to the chaunts of the celebrant, Monsignor Farley,\r\n  Archbishop of New York. Monsignor O’Connell, of Boston, and a\r\n  Dominican priest, Father Hage, preached to all who could hear\r\n  their voices. During the solemn celebration the Cardinal Legate\r\n  arrived at St. Patrick’s Church, where another function was\r\n  being held, and on his way to the altar he had to walk over a\r\n  path carpeted with flowers, and there pausing, he bestowed his\r\n  blessing on the kneeling multitude.\r\n\r\n  The supreme moment of the congress was to come in the great\r\n  procession the following day. For weeks the long route from the\r\n  Church of Notre Dame to the foot of Mount Royal, where stood the\r\n  altar already described, had been given over to architects and\r\n  workmen; tall handsome arches, things of beauty, had been raised\r\n  here and there along the route, one of them being made of wheaten\r\n  sheaves sent from the Western Canadian prairies. Thousands of\r\n  Venetian columns, obelisks, pedestals and flag poles lined the\r\n  streets; flags of all nations and innumerable electrical signs\r\n  adorned the housefronts.\r\n\r\n  The forenoon of Sunday was spent in completing the details of\r\n  the procession and precisely at 1 o’clock files of men, six\r\n  abreast, began to move past the doors of Notre Dame and, like\r\n  the corps of an immense army, then swung into the route of the\r\n  procession. Long before the route had been densely thronged, and\r\n  the mountain slopes thickly covered with expectant onlookers, for\r\n  the various railways centering in Montreal had reduced their\r\n  passenger rates in every direction within a radius of hundreds\r\n  of miles and trains laden with humanity had followed each other\r\n  at close intervals and unloaded their thousands all day Saturday\r\n  and during the early hours of Sunday. It is estimated by the\r\n  railway authorities that 200,000 strangers entered Montreal in\r\n  twenty-four hours to witness the procession. For hours before it\r\n  began the whole route was lined with people patiently waiting,\r\n  while at the foot of the mountain near the altar of repose at\r\n  least 75,000 had gathered, 20,000 of whom had been there from\r\n  early morning. It was an extraordinary spectacle to look from the\r\n  top of the mountain and see the mass of human beings moving in\r\n  every direction over the immense sward, all eventually turning\r\n  towards the handsome repository with its overtopping dome, the\r\n  whole a design of great architectural beauty. Downtown at 1\r\n  o’clock began the greatest demonstration of any kind, civic or\r\n  religious, that Canada ever witnessed. During four hours and a\r\n  half, between fifty and sixty thousand men marched silently and\r\n  prayerfully between at least half a million spectators lining\r\n  the route. The demonstration was international in its widest\r\n  extent. Citizens of the United States and Canada, together\r\n  with Lithuanians, Chinese, Syrians, Iroquois Indians in their\r\n  tribal costumes and feathers, Italians, Poles and a dozen other\r\n  nationalities besides, carrying their distinctive banners and\r\n  religious emblems, marched in one solid phalanx and in perfect\r\n  order.\r\n\r\n  But the most imposing spectacle of all was that following the\r\n  lay sections at 4 o’clock, when 1,000 choir boys, clothed in red\r\n  cassocks and surplices, followed by the Christian Brotherhoods,\r\n  hundreds of seminarians and the various religious orders of\r\n  the city took their place in the great procession; then came\r\n  2,000 priests in sacerdotal vestments, followed in order of\r\n  precedence by 100 bishops and archbishops, in cope and mitre. In\r\n  the rear of the papal officers and chamberlains came the huge\r\n  golden baldachino under which walked the tall majestic figure of\r\n  Cardinal Vannutelli, carrying the Sacred Host and accompanied\r\n  on both sides by ecclesiastical guards of honour and soldiers,\r\n  with children busily swinging censers and strewing flowers in\r\n  his path, the while the dense multitude, irrespective of creed,\r\n  bowed in the reverential awe of the moment. Behind the baldachino\r\n  walked Cardinals Logue and Gibbons, the prime minister of Canada,\r\n  Sir Wilfrid Laurier, the speaker of the House of Commons, members\r\n  of the federal and provincial governments, members of the\r\n  legislative council, the mayor of Montreal, the chief justice\r\n  and judges of the Superior Court of Canada, all in their robes\r\n  of office, members of the city council and a long line of men\r\n  belonging to the liberal professions. When these last bands\r\n  accompanying the Legate arrived it was already growing dusk and\r\n  the electric lights on the waiting altar glowed in the gloom. A\r\n  thousand voices entoned the Tantum Ergo, the Cardinal ascended\r\n  the steps, took the remonstrance containing the Sacred Host\r\n  and, raising it aloft over the 200,000 men, women and children\r\n  kneeling on the grass, gave the benediction of the congress.\r\n\r\n  The congress was over. Lights went out and the bishops and their\r\n  attendant clergy retired to the neighbouring convent of the Hôtel\r\n  Dieu to doff their robes, marching down Pine Avenue chanting\r\n  the Gregorian “Te Deum,” which sounded like the war song of the\r\n  priests, and gradually the vast multitude dispersed to their\r\n  homes.\r\n\r\nThe events of the succeeding year of 1911 recall the general\r\nfederal elections on July 11th on the question of a renewal of\r\nreciprocity with the United States when, as has been said, it was\r\nrejected by an overwhelming majority of the electorate, notably\r\nin Montreal.\r\n\r\nHarbour development was signalized this year by the signing of\r\nthe contract with the Canadian Vickers Company for the new dry\r\ndocks at the east end, and on October 4th in fitting recognition\r\nto a great harbour builder, the monument of the Hon. John\r\nYoung was unveiled on the water front by Earl Grey. Meanwhile\r\nthe general city development and expansion had been steadily\r\nincreasing since the annexations of 1883. Its population and\r\nreligions were becoming increasingly cosmopolitan and domestic\r\ntroubles among the Mohammedans of the city on July 10th\r\nsufficiently indicate this.\r\n\r\nThe year 1912 is memorable at Montreal through the sorrow caused\r\nin the city by the loss of the White liner S.S. Titanic, a\r\nhuge vessel with a displacement of 60,000 tons, which struck\r\na submerged iceberg off Cape Race on April 14th with the loss\r\nof 1,600 souls on board. While the whole world thrilled with\r\nhorror at the new revelation of the dangers of the sea to modern\r\nleviathans, Montreal had its particular grief in the loss of some\r\nof its respected citizens, Charles M. Hays, president of the\r\nGrand Trunk Railway system, Markland Molson, Thornton Davidson,\r\nVivian Payne, Q. Baxter, R.J. Levy, Mr. and Mrs. H. Allison and\r\ndaughter, and Albert Malette.\r\n\r\nThe churches of the city universally mourned this world-wide\r\ndisaster at the services of April 21st.\r\n\r\nThe month of October is memorable as the occasion of the great\r\neducational Child Welfare Exhibition held for a fortnight under\r\nthe auspices of the humanitarian societies of the city in the\r\nCraig Street Drill Hall, and drawing immense crowds.\r\n\r\nThe year 1913 was remarkable for the extraordinary activity in\r\nbuilding operations. As elsewhere related in the special chapter\r\non City Improvement, Montreal gave more evidences of being a\r\nmodern New York rather than the Ville Marie of old. It may be\r\ncalled the year of the great real estate boom.\r\n\r\nBut the last weeks of this year will stand out in civic history\r\nas a serious warning of the possibility of a city being deprived\r\nof its water supply for a long period with the additional terror\r\nof fire and disease. For 193 hours, beginning with Christmas\r\nnight, the greater part of Montreal was deprived of water by the\r\nbreaking of the concrete conduit at Lachine. Its story is told\r\nelsewhere.\r\n\r\nThe year 1914 has been one of the greatest gloom. Shortly before\r\n3 o’clock early in the morning of May 29th the disquieting news\r\nwas flashed from Quebec to Commander J.T. Walsh, superintendent\r\nof the Canadian Pacific Steamship Company, that about 2:30\r\no’clock its greatest steamer, the Empress of Ireland, had been\r\nstruck about thirty miles east of Farther Point, but without\r\nfurther information. Shortly another report told that it had\r\nbeen struck by the Storstad, a Norwegian collier bound for\r\nMontreal, and was sinking rapidly in sight of Rimouski. At first\r\nthe news was not credited as possible, but it was too true. The\r\nship sank almost immediately, being struck in the bowels and\r\nfilling straightway with water. Montrealers felt the disaster\r\nmost keenly, as its sister ships have their headquarters here and\r\nits officers were men personally known on the St. Lawrence and\r\nthe Montreal route. Of the total 1,367 souls on board, 959 lives\r\nwere lost and less than four hundred saved. The disaster was\r\nfaced with courage and sympathetic humanitarianism by the many\r\nofficers of the company who journeyed down to Quebec and spared\r\nno effort by night or day to make the tragedy less painful to the\r\nrelatives of the survivors. The sailor institutions of Montreal\r\non this occasion were glad to cooperate with those of Quebec and\r\nsupervised the sad task of identifying the drowned and burying\r\nthe bodies of the sailors as they were rescued from the waters\r\nor the shores of Rimouski and taken to the mournful morgues at\r\nQuebec.\r\n\r\nTowards the end of July, 1914, war was declared between Austria\r\nand Servia. This involved Germany on the side of Austria, and\r\nRussia and France on the side of Servia, and on August 30th\r\nGreat Britain because of Germany breaking the neutrality of\r\nBelgium, entered what was to be the most devastating war in\r\nthe history of nations. Canada at once declared her loyalty to\r\nthe Motherland in a very practical way. The Federal government\r\npresented 3,000,000 bags of flour and raised a contingent of\r\n33,000 of her best men. The Provinces vied with each other in\r\ncontributing huge quantities of wheat, flour, apples, and in\r\nthe case of the Province of Quebec, 2,000,000 pounds of cheese.\r\nA National Patriotic Fund was started with branches in every\r\nmunicipality throughout the Dominion--Montreal’s contribution\r\ntotalling $2,000,000, in addition to which a Montreal citizen, A.\r\nHamilton Gault, gave $500,000 to raise a regiment to be composed\r\nof veterans. This regiment of 1,000 picked men was named after\r\nthe daughter of the Governor-General, the Duke of Connaught,\r\nthe “Princess Patricia Light Infantry” and joined the first\r\ncontingent, which left Canada on October 2nd, in thirty-one\r\ntransports, principally vessels trading to Montreal, and under\r\neleven convoys. This armada, which was the largest that ever\r\nsailed the Atlantic seas, reached Plymouth, October 16th, and\r\nthe contingent was immediately entrained to Salisbury Plain to\r\ncomplete its training. Montreal contributed 3,200 men towards\r\nthis first contingent. Their arrival in England was the occasion\r\nof much popular satisfaction at this great spectacle of Imperial\r\nunion.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HOMES OF PROMINENT MONTREAL CITIZENS]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: “Rokeby,” the residence of A.

The spontaneity of the Canadian\r\npeople in rising to their privileges as British citizens has\r\nnever been so pronounced. Every man and every woman in the\r\nDominion, irrespective of national origin, wanted to do something\r\nto aid the Motherland. And Montreal was in the van.\r\n\r\nImmediately the first contingent embarked the government decided\r\non raising a second and recruiting started afresh. While the\r\nFrench-Canadians of the country had contributed 2,146 to the\r\nfirst contingent, being the more notable contribution of Canadian\r\nborn subjects, the majority of the volunteers were those who were\r\nBritish born. But now the French-Canadians of the city determined\r\nto raise a regiment composed entirely of their compatriots to\r\nbe called “Le Régiment Royal Canadien” and over three thousand\r\nmen applied for admission. The Irish-Canadians, too, raised a\r\nregiment for home defense named the “Fifty-fifth Irish Canadian\r\nRangers” with the Minister of Justice, the Hon. Charles J.\r\nDoherty, as Honorary Lieutenant Colonel. The neighbouring city of\r\nWestmount, under the direction of the mayor and council, raised\r\nthe “Westmount Rifles” and even the suburban town of Outremont\r\nraised an artillery battery of 105 men. A number of prominent\r\ncitizens of Montreal, on the initiative of Mr. J.N. Greenshields,\r\nK.C., equipped and are sustaining a “Home Guard” of 3,000 at\r\ntheir own expense. Towards the Patriotic Fund the local councils\r\ncontributed as follows: Montreal, $150,000; Westmount, $5,000;\r\nOutremont, $5,000; Maisonneuve, $2,000; Verdun, $3,000; and the\r\nsmaller municipalities lesser but proportionate amounts. These\r\nfunds are being augumented daily.\r\n\r\nThe war affected Montreal in another way, industrially and\r\nfinancially. On the declaration of war the banks called in\r\ntheir loans and though the government came to their aid in the\r\nnegotiation of their collateral the fact of the stoppage of\r\ncapital from Great Britain disorganized the industrial machinery\r\nof the country and thousands were thrown out of employment.\r\nIn addition to this the forcible internment of the Germans\r\nand Austrians, of which 3,400 were in Montreal alone, caused\r\nmuch anxiety to the authorities, for none would employ them.\r\nA delegation from Montreal waited upon the acting premier,\r\nSir George Foster, November 2d, asking for the cooperation of\r\nthe Government in alleviating the general distress. This Sir\r\nGeorge promised as far as the interned enemies were concerned,\r\nbut thought each municipality should take the responsibility of\r\nlooking after its own unemployed.\r\n\r\nMontreal at this period was like a huge garrison town. Recruits,\r\nwith and without uniforms, university professors and students,\r\nrich and poor alike, were being drilled in every open space\r\nand many public and private halls. For barracks the dismantled\r\nProtestant High School on Peel Street and other buildings were\r\nused for the young men of the second contingent.\r\n\r\nNot only were the canals, bridges, wharves and public buildings\r\npatrolled by soldiers in uniform, since the first news of the\r\noutbreak of the war, but the streets of Montreal and the suburbs\r\nhave been the constant scenes of much militarism. A lasting\r\nmemory will survive in numerous streets and avenues, either\r\nbeing opened or bearing names already employed elsewhere, being\r\nappointed henceforth to bear the names of generals and towns\r\nconnected with the war, such as Joffre, Pau, Liège, Namur and\r\nAisne.\r\n\r\nAbout the city committees of devoted women of all national\r\norigins and of all the numerous charitable associations, were\r\npatriotically visiting the wives and dependents of volunteers\r\nfor the front and administering the allowances granted by the\r\nPatriotic Fund, the headquarters of which were in the new\r\nDrummond Building at the corner of St. Catherine and Peel\r\nstreets. And in this central room a busy committee was engaged\r\nall day on the careful systematic organization of the relief\r\nfund. Over the city in church, school, club and private rooms,\r\ngroups were busily knitting and sewing and fashioning all sorts\r\nof comforts and necessities for those who had heard the call to\r\nfight for the maintenance of the Empire. The city has become a\r\nbusy loom of patriotic charity.\r\n\r\nAll honour to the loyal women of Montreal in this moment of the\r\nworld’s greatest war.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CANADIAN AID FOR BELGIAN SUFFERERS]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUNDER ENGLISH RULE\r\n\r\n\r\nPART II\r\n\r\nSPECIAL PROGRESS\r\n\r\n\r\n  CHAPTER\r\n\r\n  XXIV     THE CATHOLIC CHURCH.\r\n  XXV      OTHER RELIGIOUS DENOMINATIONS.\r\n  XXVI     SCHOOL SYSTEM OF MONTREAL BEFORE THE CESSION.\r\n  XXVII    SCHOOL SYSTEM OF MONTREAL AFTER THE UNION.\r\n  XXVIII   UNIVERSITY DEVELOPMENT.\r\n  XXIX     LITERATURE--DRAMA--MUSIC--ART.\r\n  XXX      NATIONAL SOCIETIES AND POPULATION.\r\n  XXXI     FIRE, LIGHTING, WATER.\r\n  XXXII    LAW AND ORDER.\r\n  XXXIII   HOSPITALS.\r\n  XXXIV    SOCIOLOGICAL MOVEMENTS.\r\n  XXXV     BEFORE THE UNION.\r\n  XXXVI    SINCE THE UNION.\r\n  XXXVII   BANKING AND INSURANCE.\r\n  XXXVIII  SHIPPING: EARLY AND MODERN.\r\n  XXXIX    THE PORT AND HARBOUR.\r\n  XL       RAILROADS.\r\n  XLI      POST ROADS AND STREET RAILWAY.\r\n  XLII     FROM THE CESSION.\r\n  XLIII    UNDER THE UNION.\r\n  XLIV     SINCE CONFEDERATION.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                          CHAPTER XXIV\r\n\r\n                     RELIGIOUS DENOMINATIONS\r\n\r\n\r\n                                I\r\n\r\n                       THE CATHOLIC CHURCH\r\n\r\n  EARLY CHAPELS AND CHURCHES--THE FIRST PARISH CHURCH--OTHER\r\n    CHURCHES STANDING AT THE FALL OF MONTREAL--NOTRE DAME DE\r\n    VICTOIRE--NOTRE DAME DE PITIE--THE “RECOLLET”--THE PRESENT\r\n    NOTRE DAME CHURCH--ERECTION AND OPENING--THE “OLD AND\r\n    NEW”--THE TOWERS AND BELLS--THE ECCLESIASTICAL DIOCESE OF\r\n    QUEBEC--THE BISHOPS OF MONTREAL--THE DIVISION OF THE CITY\r\n    INTO PARISHES--THE CHURCHES AND “RELIGIOUS”--ENGLISH-SPEAKING\r\n    CATHOLICS--ST.

NOTE: THE\r\n    “RELIGIOUS” COMMUNITIES OF MEN AND WOMEN.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe history of the Catholic Church in Montreal is largely that of\r\nits churches and its religious orders or congregations.\r\n\r\nIts history commences with the date of the first mass on the\r\ncommon on September 8, 1642, in the open air, the day of the\r\narrival of M. de Maisonneuve and the first colonists, though\r\nmass had already been said on the island as far back as 1615 in\r\nChamplain’s presence at the Rivière des Prairies, by the first\r\nRecollect fathers, Joseph le Caron and Denis Jamay.\r\n\r\nFrom 1642 to 1657 the Jesuit missionaries served the small group\r\nof colonists, at which dates these were succeeded by the priests\r\nof the congregation of St. Sulpice, founded in Paris by M. Jean\r\nJacques Olier, at Vaugirard in January, 1649, a main purpose of\r\nwhich was to supply priests for the mission founded at Montreal\r\nby the Compagnie de Notre Dame de Montréal.\r\n\r\nThe first chapel “of the fort” was one of bark, which was\r\nsucceeded shortly by a frame building which served adequately\r\ntill 1656. In this year a new chapel building in wood was\r\nadjoined to the Hotel Dieu at the corner of St. Paul and St.\r\nJoseph (St. Sulpice) and served as the church of St. Joseph for\r\nthe hospital and the citizens till 1678 on the completion of the\r\nfirst parish church of Notre Dame, begun in 1672.\r\n\r\nThis church was regarded as a wondrous monument in its time, and\r\nas it was standing at the time of the fall of Montreal, and was\r\nnot entirely demolished till 1843, its history forms part of\r\nthat of Montreal under British rule, serving to connect the two\r\nregimes.\r\n\r\nIt stood on the top of St. Sulpice Street, then St. Joseph, and\r\nits front was placed on the axis of Notre Dame Street and Place\r\nd’Armes, in front of the site of the modern Notre Dame church.\r\nIt was raised by subscriptions assisted by the Gentlemen of the\r\nSeminary.\r\n\r\nThe original church begun in 1672 was gradually enlarged. From\r\n1720 to 1724 there were discussions among the _Marguilliers_\r\nor church wardens on the building of an imposing bell tower\r\ncapable of holding four bells, as well as on the construction of\r\na portail as an imposing entrance facade to the church. In 1722\r\ndiscussions arose as to whether it should be placed southeast or\r\nnorthwest of the church. The new tower on the northwest was built\r\nabout 1725. This served as a belfry for various bells cast in\r\nMontreal till that named Thomas Marguerite came from London in\r\n1773, being one of the old ones recast, and was blessed on July\r\n4th by M. Montgolfier, superior of the seminary. It received its\r\nname after Thomas Dufy Desaulniers and Marguerite, probably the\r\nname of Madame Le Moyne, the other godparent. The belfry proper\r\nwas erected in 1777, the iron cross surmounting it in 1778, the\r\ncopper gilt cock bought in London being placed in 1782.\r\n\r\nBefore relating the history of the Notre Dame church of today\r\nit will be proper to account for the other churches of Montreal\r\nerected before the capitulation in 1760, and bridging over the\r\ntwo periods of rule.\r\n\r\nThe Church of Notre Dame de Bonsecours was not standing on the\r\narrival of the British. The first church of this name was built\r\nin wood by Marguerite Bourgeoys, the first stone being laid\r\nin 1657 by the famous Jesuit missionary among the Onondagas,\r\nFather Simon Le Moyne, the building being finished in 1659. The\r\nsecond building, also erected by Marguerite Bourgeoys, was the\r\nfirst stone church in Montreal. It was given to the Fabrique in\r\n1678. It was reduced to ashes in the fire of 1754 and the third\r\nchurch was built between 1771 and 1773. In 1847-48 the church was\r\ndecorated and on October 6, 1840, there was held a procession of\r\nthe boats on the river and there took place, with Bishop Bourget\r\npresiding, the solemn translation of the new statue of Our Lady\r\nof Bonsecours specially destined for voyagers and sailors and\r\nplaced on the exterior to dominate the port. It had been known\r\nas the Sailors’ Chapel, being on the quay. It was remodeled\r\nin 1889, according to critics, at the expense of many of its\r\nBreton-like attractive features. On the apse of the chapel is a\r\ncolossal statue of the Blessed Virgin with outstretched arms to\r\nprotect the sea-going vessels and sailors. On the roof is another\r\nchapel, a facsimile of the Holy House of Loretto. The church\r\nitself possesses a miraculous statue of Our Lady. The sanctuary\r\nis all marble, there are handsome stained glass windows and many\r\nhistoric pictures and votive offerings.\r\n\r\nUntil recently there stood off Notre Dame Street at the\r\nnorthwest entrance to the garden of the “Congregation” the\r\nquaint and picturesque church of Notre Dame de Pitié. Its\r\noriginal predecessor was commenced in 1693 and finished in\r\n1695, principally through the benefactions of the recluse,\r\nJeanne LeBer, daughter of the famous merchant, Jacques LeBer,\r\nwho dwelt for twenty years (from 1694 to her death in 1714) in\r\na little cell behind the altar. After the cession it was burnt\r\ndown on April 11, 1768, and was rebuilt many years afterwards,\r\nthe first mass being said in 1786. In 1856 this church of the\r\n“Congregation” (60 feet ×30) was demolished to make room for the\r\nNotre Dame de Pitié (108 feet ×46). This was built to receive\r\na wooden, miraculous statue of Notre Dame de Pitié, which\r\noriginally was placed in the Church of St. Didier in Avignon,\r\nFrance, in the fourteenth century. In 1789 this church was\r\ndemolished during the French revolution and the statue came into\r\nthe possession of a Madame Paladére, who gave it to the clergy.\r\nIn 1852 it came into the hands of the Rev. M. Fabris, who, at\r\nthe request of the Abbé Faillon, the historian, gave it to the\r\nCongregation at Montreal. It reached Montreal on July 1, 1855,\r\nand, pending the completion of the Church of Notre Dame de Pitié,\r\nwas kept in the convent hard by, its solemn transference to the\r\nchurch, by Bishop Bourget, taking place on August 15, 1860. In\r\n1912 it was demolished to make room for the projected extension\r\nof St. Lawrence Main Street to the wharves, at which time the\r\nadjoining historic convent of the Congregation nuns also suffered\r\nthe same fate.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: NOTRE DAME DE PITIE (REAR VIEW)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: NOTRE DAME DE PITIE CHURCH (Demolished)]\r\n\r\nIn 1718 there was built near the church of Notre Dame de Pitié,\r\nand on the grounds of the Congregation, the chapel of Notre\r\nDame de la Victoire. This was erected by the ladies of a pious\r\nsodality entitled Les Demoiselles de la Congregation Externe, in\r\naccordance with a vow made by them in 1711 on the occasion of the\r\nsafety of Canada by the destruction of the fleet of Sir Hovenden\r\nWalker. It was burnt down on April 11, 1768, at the same time\r\nas the Mother House but rebuilt the same year. It was finally\r\ndemolished in 1900. Other chapels connecting the old with the new\r\nMontreal were the Convent Chapel of the Charron Brothers, which\r\nbecame that of the Grey Nuns Hospital, and the Convent Chapel of\r\nthe Hotel Dieu, on St. Paul Street. Their history is coincident\r\nwith that of the buildings described elsewhere.\r\n\r\nTwo other churches built in the French régime were still standing\r\nat the capitulation during the early British period, the Jesuits’\r\nchurch, which was commenced in 1692 and finished in 1694, being\r\nrebuilt and enlarged in 1742. After the capitulation of Montreal\r\nand the subsequent suppression of the Society of Jesuits, it\r\nbecame through the favour of the government the church of the\r\nAnglicans till 1803, when it was burnt down in the great fire of\r\nthat year. The other church bridging over the two periods was\r\nthat of the Recollects, which was built and finished between 1693\r\nand 1700. There was also the Recollect Chapel, for towards 1709\r\nthere took place the blessing of M. de Belmont and the placing\r\nof the first stone of the Recollect Chapel by M. le Baron de\r\nLongueuil, major governor of Montreal. In the early days of the\r\nBritish rule the Recollects lent their church or chapel to the\r\nAnglicans and Presbyterians for service;\r\n\r\nTheir original grounds extended on the north from Notre Dame west\r\nto Lemoine Street on the south, and from McGill Street on the\r\nwest to St. Peter Street on the east.\r\n\r\nThe “Récollet” began to fall on evil times, for before 1818 the\r\nRecollect property had passed into the hands of the Hon. Charles\r\nWilliam Grant; the church, the house and part of the convent was\r\npurchased by the Fabrique of Notre Dame on August 28, 1818, from\r\nhim. Collections were then taken up for its repairs, which were\r\nundertaken next year, according to the plan of M. Delorme in\r\norder to fit it for divine service. In 1822 the Rev. John Richard\r\n(or Richards) Jackson was permitted to occupy the lower part of\r\nthe house by putting a schoolmaster there for the children of the\r\nIrish immigrants then beginning to arrive. About 1830 it became\r\nthe recognized chapel for the Irish immigrants and at this time\r\nit became considerably improved by the gift of the portail of\r\nthe old Notre Dame. On March 9, 1867, the church on the corner\r\nof Récollet and Notre Dame streets with its land was sold to\r\nMessrs. Lewis, Kay & Company for the sum of $85,000, or $4.00 a\r\nfoot, and was demolished. The successors of the Recollects, the\r\nFranciscans, O.F.M. (Order of Friars Minor) returned to the city\r\nand established themselves on Dorchester Street West about 1900.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    NOTRE DAME PARISH CHURCH\r\n\r\nWe may now trace the history of the present Notre Dame parish\r\nchurch. By 1757 the parish church begun in 1672 being already\r\ntoo small, it was determined to buy land to build one 300 feet\r\nin length, and by 1823 land was bought for this purpose and the\r\nchurch commenced this year. This included the land on Place\r\nd’Armes on which there was the public library in Montreal. This\r\neventually was not built on for the war ending in the cession\r\ntook place. The Place d’Armes property bought, according to the\r\ndescription made in 1824 by Roy Portelance, Toussaint Peltier,\r\npère, and Charles Coté, père, was “L’Emplacement, situé sur\r\nla place d’armes contenait 180 pds de front sur 94 pds de\r\nprofondeur, tenant pardevant a la place d’armes derrière à la\r\nruelle des fortifications, d’un coté au Sieur Dillon et de\r\nl’autre coté au Docteur Leodel; sur lequel etaint construits une\r\nmaison en pierre à deux etages converte en ferblanc de 60 pds de\r\nfront sur 62 pds de profondeur, et autres bâtiments en bois.”\r\n\r\nThe Place d’Armes commenced in the middle of Great St. James\r\nStreet and occupied the position now filled by the Bank of\r\nMontreal and the Royal Trust Building. It was thought then--in\r\n1757--proper to build here and to transfer the Place d’Armes to\r\nsome other position, the ground in front of the Jesuit residence\r\nbeing thought suitable. Subscriptions began in 1823 for the\r\nnew church by a minute of the church warden on July 20th. The\r\nbuilding committee appointed was M. le Curé; Le Saulnier,\r\npresident; M.M. Louis Guy, J.P. Leprohon, F.A. Larocque, N.B.\r\nDoucet, T. Bouthillier and A. Laframboise, to whom later were\r\nadded M. Olivier Berthelet in place of M. Doucet, and the\r\nfollowing new church wardens, viz., M.M.C.S. Delorme, Pierre\r\nPomminville, Pascal Comte, Jules Quesnel, Joseph Chevalier and\r\nPascal Persillier-LaChapelle. Messrs. Francis Desrivieres and P.\r\nde Rocheblave (Marguilliers) were named treasurers in February,\r\n1824.\r\n\r\nThe land bought for the new church included the houses and\r\ngrounds of Messrs. Gerrard, Starnes, the estate, Perrault and\r\nFisher, situated on St. Joseph Street (St. Sulpice), and also\r\nthat proposed to be ceded to the Fabrique by the Gentlemen of\r\nthe Seminary. The value of the land was estimated at £24,000.\r\nOn October 5th the blessing of the cross marking the site was\r\nconducted by Mgr. B.C. Panet, coadjutor bishop of Quebec. In\r\nSeptember, 1824, the first stone was blessed by M. Roux, superior\r\nof the seminary. The following minute tells of the blessing of\r\nthe new church. “1829, June 7. Pentecost Day, at seven o’clock in\r\nthe morning. The new parish church has been blessed according to\r\nthe usage and custom of Holy Church under the invocation of the\r\nHoly Name of Mary by Messire Jean Henry Auguste Roux, superior\r\nof the seminary, curé of the parish and vicar general of the\r\ndiocese, in presence of the undersigned priests and of several\r\nchurch wardens and other parishioners:\r\n\r\n“Roux, Vic. Gen., Malard, ptre., Sattin, ptre., Sauvage,\r\nptre., Richard, ptre., F. ant. LaRocque, T. Bouthillier, P. de\r\nRocheblave, P. Jos. Lacroix, Joseph Masson, O. Berthelet, Alexis\r\nLaframboise, Jules Quesnel, F. Souligny, Pierre Baudry, N.B.\r\nDoucet.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BONSECOURS CHURCH]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BONSECOURS CHURCH AT AN EARLY PERIOD]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BONSECOURS CHURCH WITH ITS BARNACLES, SHORTLY\r\nBEFORE ITS RECONSTRUCTION]\r\n\r\nThe first mass said in the new parish church was by the Rev. Mr.\r\nRichards-Jackson, an English convert who died at Montreal of\r\ntyphus on July 21, 1849, beloved by the Irish population. The\r\ncelebration of the formal opening took place on July 15th when\r\nHigh Mass was sung by Mgr. J.J. Lartigue, bishop of Telmesse, and\r\nthe first sermon delivered by M.J.V. Quiblier. A distinguished\r\ncongregation was present, including the administrator of the\r\nprovince of Lower Canada, Sir James Kempt, his suite and the\r\nrepresentatives of the different corporations of the city.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the old church of 1672 stood in front of the new one\r\nbut not for long. The bodies of the dead were reverently removed\r\nto the vaults under the new church. On June 6, 1830, it was\r\nresolved by the Fabrique to give the Irish of the city, for the\r\nenlargement of the Récollet Church in which they now worshiped,\r\nthe cut stone of the _portail_ in front of the old church,\r\ntogether with other church objects from within. Then the church\r\nwas demolished in August, 1830, but the belfry tower stood till\r\n1843, a curious old-time relic blocking the passage on Notre\r\nDame Street. The four bells were taken down on August 23d and\r\nthe old tower pulled down on August 24th, about 4:30 P.M. Two of\r\nthe bells, one of them the Charlotte, cast in Canada in 1774 and\r\nweighing, without the hammer, 2,167 pounds, were given later to\r\nSt. Patrick’s Church. The architect of the new parish church died\r\non January 30th, of the same year. He was a Mr. James O’Donnell,\r\na native of Wexford, in Ireland. At his request his remains were\r\nburied in the new church.\r\n\r\nThe towers of the new church were not constructed till later.\r\nThat on the Epistle side (west) called the Tower of Perseverence,\r\nwas constructed in 1841 and blessed by the Bishop of Nancy, in\r\nNovember of the same year. That on the Gospel side (east), the\r\nTower of Temperance, was not finished till 1842. Each tower is\r\n227 feet high. The ten bells in the Tower of Temperance arrived\r\nat Montreal on May 24, 1843, and were blessed on June 29th by\r\nBishop Bourget. They were cast in London by Mears & Company and\r\nwere sounded for the first time on June 19th, at midday, from\r\ntheir position in the eastern tower. The history of the bells is\r\nas follows:\r\n\r\n        Name.                      Pounds.            Donor.\r\n\r\n   1. Maria Victoria                6,041     The Seminary.\r\n   2.

Augustinus                      897     Auguste Perrault.\r\n\r\nThe first Gros Bourdon, cast in February, 1843, weighing 16,352\r\npounds and the largest bell on the continent, arrived from Mears\r\n& Company, London, in October, 1843, the gift of merchants,\r\nartisans and farmers. It was broken in the month of May, 1845,\r\nand was sent to England to be recast. The second Gros Bourdon\r\nweighed 24,780 pounds. It arrived in 1847 an was solemnly blessed\r\nunder the name of Jean Baptiste on June 18, 1848. The ascent\r\ncommenced at 3:30 P.M., June 21st, and about 7:30 P.M. it was\r\ninstalled in its present position in the western tower.\r\n\r\nThe organ of the parish church, constructed in 1857 by Mr. S.\r\nWarren, was inaugurated in its unfinished condition on June 24,\r\n1858.\r\n\r\nThe church may be described as follows: “There are two immense\r\narcades (60 feet high) with three niches containing the statues\r\nof the Blessed Virgin, St. Joseph and St. John the Baptist,\r\npatrons of the City and of the Lower Province. A flight of stairs\r\nor an elevator leads to the summit whence a splendid view may\r\nbe obtained over the City and the St. Lawrence. The interior\r\n(including the sanctuary) is 255 feet long by 134 feet wide and\r\n80 feet high. Two galleries extend 25 feet over the lower side\r\naisles. The architect was instructed to plan a building with a\r\nseating capacity of 10,000 persons. The idea was to enable the\r\ncongregation to follow the sacred functions and to hear the\r\npreacher without too much of an exertion. Notre Dame complies\r\nwith this twofold condition. Beauty had to be sacrificed to\r\npractical use, and still the wealth of materials, the profusion\r\nof paintings and decorations throughout, the numerous statues and\r\nespecially its imposing and well proportioned dimensions leave\r\na deep and lasting impression on the visitor. There are nine\r\nchapels and altars in the body of the church. At the right: The\r\nchapels of the Holy Face; Our Lady of Perpetual Help with a copy\r\nof the Byzantine Virgin which is venerated in Rome; Saint Amable,\r\nSt. Joseph’s, and, at the foot of the aisle, the Blessed Virgin’s\r\nchapel, with a painting by Del Sarto. On the tabernacle door is\r\na fine painting of ‘The Virgin and Child’ by Fra Angelico. The\r\ncross and candlesticks on this altar were manufactured at Paris\r\nand are of most exquisite workmanship. On the outer wall of the\r\nsanctuary is a good copy of Mignard’s: ‘Saint Ignatius writing\r\nthe constitutions of his Order.’ The altar of the Sacred Heart is\r\non the other side of the sanctuary. To the right of this altar,\r\nwhich, by the way, is an artistic gem, may be seen a noteworthy\r\nold painting: ‘The Presentation in the Temple.’ Down the aisle,\r\nother altars may be seen; St. Ann’s (Painting by Carnevalli),\r\nthe Souls in Purgatory and St. Roch’s. The pulpit is almost on a\r\nlevel with the gallery. On its sounding board are several fine\r\nstatues and below the statues of two of the Prophets, the work\r\nof P. Herbert, one of America’s most renowned sculptors. The\r\nsanctuary is raised five steps above the nave and separated by\r\nthe chancel-rail. The latter is of most precious wood and so\r\nare the chancel-seats and the monumental reredos. On the first\r\npillar to the right just outside the chancel, under a gilt dome,\r\nis a white marble statue of the Madonna. It is the work of a\r\nBavarian artist and displays remarkable skill. Pius IX, who\r\nprized it highly, presented it to the Rector of Notre Dame, Abbe\r\nRousselot. At the other extremity of the railing is a second\r\ndome surmounting a bronze facsimile of the statue of St. Peter,\r\nin St. Peter’s, Rome. The high altar is ornamented with numerous\r\nsculptures of rare design and workmanship. ‘The Last Supper,’ in\r\nbas-relief, is most artistic, and so are the ‘Choirs of Angels’\r\nat each side of the tabernacle. The sanctuary is illuminated on\r\nfestal days with myriads of electric lights which produce\r\na dazzling effect. The organ is one of the most powerful in\r\nAmerica. It was manufactured by Casavant Bros., St. Hyacinthe.\r\n\r\n“Behind the sanctuary is a richly adorned chapel of Our Lady of\r\nthe Sacred Heart. Its paintings are inestimable in value and\r\nthe work of Canadian artists. Over the main door is a copy of\r\nRaphael’s: ‘Discussion on the Blessed Eucharist,’ by Larose.\r\nFrom left to right: ‘Paradise Lost,’ ‘The Sybil of Tibur,’\r\n‘The Annunciation,’ by Larose; ‘The Visitation,’ by Gill; ‘The\r\nAdoration of the Magi,’ by Saint Charles; ‘The Virgin of the\r\nApocalypse,’ ‘The Transfiguration’ (above the high altar),\r\n‘Christ the Consoler,’ by Franchere; ‘Dollard and his Sixteen\r\nCompanions,’ ‘The First Mass in Montreal,’ by Saint Charles; ‘The\r\nRock of Horeb,’ by Franchère; ‘The Wedding of Cana,’ by Beau; and\r\n‘The Multiplication of the Loaves,’ by Franchère. The parochial\r\nsodalities meet in this chapel, but more especially so, the male\r\nand female members of the Association of Perpetual Adoration. In\r\nthe treasury may be seen gorgeous costly church-ornaments and\r\nvestments, precious reliquaries, chalices, ciboriums of gold and\r\nsilver, the embroidery work of Jeanne LeBer, a massive monstrance\r\nand the artistically arranged hangings or draperies of the grand\r\ndais which is used once a year for the solemn procession of the\r\nBlessed Sacrament through the streets of the City.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: NOTRE DAME CHURCH]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SACRED HEART CHAPEL]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: INTERIOR OF NOTRE DAME]\r\n\r\n\r\n                   THE ECCLESIASTICAL DIOCESE\r\n\r\nMontreal was ecclesiastically in the jurisdiction of the diocese\r\nof Quebec till 1836. At the fall of Montreal there was no bishop,\r\nthe occupant of the see, Henri Marie Dubreuil de Pontbriand,\r\nhaving died on June 1, 1760. His successors in the see of Quebec\r\nwere:\r\n\r\nJean Olivier Briand, named January 21, 1766, consecrated March\r\n16, 1766, resigned June 29, 1784, died November 25, 1784;\r\nLouis-Philippe Mariauchau d’Esglis, consecrated July 12, 1772,\r\nbishop of Quebec November 29, 1774, died June 4, 1788; Jean\r\nFrançois Hubert, consecrated November 29, 1786, bishop of Quebec\r\nJune 12, 1788, resigned September 1, 1797, died October, 1797;\r\nPierre Denaut, born at Montreal July 20, 1743, consecrated June\r\n29, 1789, bishop of Quebec, September 1, 1797, died January 17,\r\n1806; Joseph Octave Plessis, born at Montreal, March 3, 1763,\r\nconsecrated January 25, 1801, bishop of Quebec, January 17, 1806,\r\narchbishop in 1819, died December 4, 1825; Bernard Claude Panet,\r\nbishop-archbishop of Quebec December 4, 1825, died February 14,\r\n1833; Joseph Signay, consecrated May 20, 1827, bishop of Quebec\r\nFebruary 14, 1833, archbishop Metropolitan July 13, 1844, died\r\nOctober 3, 1850.\r\n\r\nThe first bishop of Montreal was Mgr. Jean Jacques Lartigue, who\r\nwas born in Montreal on June 20, 1777, was elected titular bishop\r\nof Telmesse on February 1, 1820, and consecrated on January 21,\r\n1821. He was elected bishop of the new diocese of Montreal on\r\nMay 13, 1836, and enthroned on September 8th following. He died\r\nin the Hotel Dieu on April 30, 1849, before, therefore, the\r\nincorporation of the diocese on May 30, 1849. His successor to\r\nthe see was Mgr. Ignace Bourget, born at Pointe Lévis on October\r\n30, 1799. He was elected titular of Telmesse and coadjutor of\r\nMontreal “cum futura successione” on March 10, 1837, and was\r\nconsecrated on July 25th following. He became bishop of Montreal\r\non April 19, 1840, and resigned on May 11, 1876, but was named\r\ntitular archbishop of Marianopolis in the month of July. He\r\ndied at Sault au Récollet June 8, 1885. His coadjutor bishop had\r\nbeen Mgr. J.C. Prince from 1845 and Mgr. Joseph Larocque from\r\n1852. His Grace, Mgr. Edouard Charles Fabre, born at Montreal\r\non February 28, 1827, succeeded him as bishop of Montreal on\r\nMay 11, 1876, and took possession of the seat on September 19th\r\nfollowing. He had been previously elected titular bishop of\r\nGratianopolis and coadjutor “cum futura successione” of Montreal\r\non April 1, 1873, being consecrated in the Church of the Gésu\r\non May 1st following. In 1886, on June 8th, Mgr. Fabre became\r\nelected the first archbishop of Montreal, receiving the pallium\r\non July 27th of the same year. His death occurred on December\r\n30, 1896. The present occupant of the see is His Grace, Mgr.\r\nPaul Bruchesi, who was born at Montreal on October 29, 1855,\r\nwas elected Archbishop on June 25, 1897, and consecrated in the\r\nCathedral church on August 8th of the same year. Two years later,\r\non August 8th, he received the pallium.\r\n\r\nThere are two auxiliary bishops: Mgr. Francois Theophile Zotique\r\nRacicot, born at Sault au Récollet on October 13, 1845, and\r\nelected bishop of Poglia and coadjutor of Montreal on January 14,\r\n1905, and consecrated on the following May 3d; and Mgr.

Bruchesi on June 28,\r\n1912, being consecrated on August 24th of the same year.\r\n\r\nUntil 1866 Notre Dame was the only parish church. From that date\r\nother parishes began to be canonically erected as such. The\r\nparish churches of Montreal in the year 1913 were as follows,\r\nwith the dates of foundation, but not of canonical erection.\r\nThose various and numerous semi-public chapels, oratories, or\r\nchurches, attached to the religious congregations not recognized\r\nas parish churches, are not included:\r\n\r\nNotre Dame (first church, begun 1672, canonically erected 1678),\r\nsecond, formally opened, 1829; Saint Jacques (first church,\r\n1822-1825), (second, 1857), (third, 1860), constituted the second\r\nparish church in 1866; Saint Enfant Jesus, founded in 1849,\r\nerected canonically in 1867; Sacré Coeur de Jesus, 1874, 835\r\nOntario Street, East: Très Saint Nom de Jésus de Maisonneuve,\r\n1888; Très Saint Rédempteur, 1913, Hochelaga; Immaculée\r\nConception, 1884; Nativité de la B.V.M. d’Hochelaga, 1875; Notre\r\nDame de Carmel, 1905, Italian; Notre Dame du Bon Conseil, 1881,\r\n724 Craig Street, East; Notre Dame Della Difesa, 1910, Italian;\r\nNotre Dame de Grâce, 1867; Notre Dame des Neiges, 1901; Notre\r\nDame de Perpétuel Secours, 1906; Notre Dame de Saint Rosaire\r\nde Villeray, 1898; Notre Dame de Sept.

JEAN-JACQUES LARTIQUE First bishop of\r\nMontreal, 1777-1840]\r\n\r\nIn addition there are missions to Chinese (numbering 200),\r\nLithuanians (1,000), Poles (1,500), Ruthenians (5,000), Syrians\r\n(3 rites), Pure Syrians, Syro-Maronites and Syro-Melchites\r\n(1,000).\r\n\r\nIt would require a volume to give the history of all these\r\nparishes or of their many beautiful churches, but we may\r\nchoose the following for historical reasons, viz.: the present\r\nCathedral of St. James, the seat of the Archbishop of Montreal;\r\nthe Church of St. James, the second parish and the site of the\r\nfirst Cathedral; the Chapel of Our Lady of Lourdes, as a type of\r\nseveral of the non-parish chapels in the city; the Gésu and St.\r\nPeter’s, as an example of public churches conducted by religious\r\npriests; and, as the English-speaking Catholic community is\r\nan entity of its own, St. Patrick’s church and others will be\r\ntreated as affording an opportunity of reviewing the religious\r\nhistory of the Irish in the city.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       ST. JAMES CATHEDRAL\r\n\r\nThe Cathedral, one of the largest temples on the continent, is\r\nadmirably situated on Dominion Square, and its location adds to\r\nthe majestic loftiness of its monumental cupola. It is one third\r\nthe size and an adapted replica of St. Peter’s, Rome. When Mgr.\r\nLartigue became Bishop of Telmesse (1821) with jurisdiction over\r\nthe Church in Montreal, his residence was at the Seminary of\r\nSt. Sulpice, and Notre Dame was to all intents and purposes the\r\ncathedral church of Montreal. He realized the disadvantages of\r\nthe situation and took up his quarters at the Hôtel Dieu. Its\r\nmodest chapel became the temporary Cathedral. In 1825, the people\r\npetitioned the Bishop to sanction the erection of a Cathedral and\r\na residence in keeping with his exalted dignity. Their request\r\nwas granted and a site chosen at the corner of St. Catherine and\r\nSt. Denis streets, where St. James church stands today. The new\r\nCathedral was dedicated by Bishop Lartigue, in 1825. His house\r\nwas a very plain building. An episcopal residence soon replaced\r\nit, and was considered one of the finest structures in Montreal.\r\nUnfortunately, in 1852, the fire which consumed a great part\r\nof the City reduced the Cathedral and the residence to ashes.\r\nMgr. Bourget, his successor, lived at St. Joseph’s Home, and\r\nthe humble chapel of the Providence Asylum became the fourth\r\nCathedral. The present site was then chosen. A modest brick\r\nchapel was erected by the side of the episcopal residence which\r\nfor over forty years has been the home of the Bishops of Montreal\r\nand of their assistants in the administration of diocesan\r\naffairs.\r\n\r\nJuly 25th, 1857, a cross was planted to mark the site of the\r\nfuture Cathedral. Mgr. Bourget, conceived the bold idea of\r\nerecting a duplicate of St. Peter’s Rome, to symbolize the\r\nunion of the Church in Canada with the See of Peter, and he\r\ninstructed Victor Bourgeault, the architect, to prepare his\r\nplans accordingly. The cornerstone was solemnly laid August 28,\r\n1870. In 1878, the walls were raised to the height of thirty\r\nfeet. The columns to support the dome were built as high as\r\nforty feet, and the other columns of the nave were elevated to\r\nthe same height. The front of the portico was completed as far\r\nas the spandrel of the first arch, but the outer dome was left\r\nunfinished. In 1885, Archbishop Fabre, his successor, resumed\r\noperations which had been suspended for seven years. In 1894, the\r\nCathedral was opened for worship. In 1886, the dome was finished,\r\na noble adornment and a salient feature in the architecture of\r\nMontreal. The cross, of gilded iron, is eighteen feet in length,\r\nweighing sixteen hundred pounds, and was placed in position\r\nduring August of the same year. Over the portico are thirteen\r\nbronze statues, donations of various parishes of the Diocese.\r\nThey are the statues of St. James, St. Joseph, St. Anthony of\r\nPadua, St. Francis of Assisi, St. Vincent of Paul, St. John, St.\r\nPaul, St. Thomas Aquinas, St. Patrick, St. Charles Borromeo, St.\r\nJohn the Baptist, St. Hyacinth and St. Ignatius. The interior\r\nis very imposing, with its rich white and gold decorations. The\r\ngraceful lines of its arches, the symmetry of its pillars and the\r\nsimplicity of its appointments inspire a sense of due reverence\r\nand devotion. Under the dome there is a faithful reproduction\r\nof Bernini’s baldachino. It was made at Rome by Victor Vincent\r\nand donated to the Cathedral by the Seminary of St. Sulpice. It\r\ncost about twelve thousand dollars. The main altar is under the\r\nbaldachino. Like the chancel-rail it is of marble and onyx. At\r\nthe Gospel side set against one of the pillars supporting the\r\ndome is the archiepiscopal throne finely sculptured and inlaid\r\nwith ivory. Several interesting paintings recalling historical\r\nfacts and events connected with the foundation and establishment\r\nof Montreal adorn the arcades of the transepts and the lower\r\nwalls. With one exception they are from the brush of G. Delfosse,\r\na gifted artist of Montreal, and under each is an inscription\r\nexplaining the different subjects. “The First Mass in Montreal”\r\nwas painted by Laurent, a French painter, and was presented to\r\nArchbishop Bruchesi by the Government of the French Republic.\r\nThe most interesting chapel is the “Papal Zouaves.” There is an\r\nexquisite painting over the altar of “Our Saviour revealing to\r\nBlessed Margaret Mary the treasures of His Sacred Heart.” The\r\nnames of the 507 Knights, who took part in the nineteenth century\r\ncrusade, are inscribed in letters of gold on four large marble\r\ntablets. In the chapel are the Regiment’s military colors; a\r\npainting of St. Gregory the Great, a gift of Pope Pius IX, to\r\nthe Union Allet; a silver statuette, a gift of General Charette;\r\na copy of “St. John the Baptist,” the original of which hangs\r\nin the Zouaves headquarters at Rome; a silver vessel used as a\r\nsanctuary lamp, a facsimile of the votive offering which the\r\nZouaves made to the Shrine of Notre Dame de Bonsecours.\r\n\r\nAt the north entrance is a fine bronze statue to the memory of\r\nBishop Bourget. Adjoining the vestry and communicating with it is\r\n“The Bishop’s Palace,” a palace in name only. In the near future\r\nthis huge brick building will be replaced by an edifice worthy\r\nthe Diocese.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PRESENTATION OF PLANS OF ST. JAMES CATHEDRAL]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: INTERIOR OF ST. JAMES CATHEDRAL]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ST. JAMES CATHEDRAL]\r\n\r\n\r\n                            ST. JAMES\r\n\r\n             (St. Catherine and St. Denis Streets.)\r\n\r\nIn 1822-25 the first church of St. James (St. Jacques le Majeur)\r\nwas built by Mgr. Lartigue, who became the first bishop of\r\nMontreal on January 21, 1821. He was a sulpician and lived until\r\n1849. This church served as the Cathedral until 1852 when it was\r\ndestroyed by the terrible fire which consumed a great portion\r\nof the City. Bishop Bourget, his successor, definitely left the\r\nneighbourhood of St. James and took up his quarters on Mount\r\nSt. Joseph. In 1855, the Priests of the Seminary were placed in\r\ncharge of the parish. The church was scarcely built in 1857 when\r\nit was destroyed by another fire. As the walls were uninjured\r\nthe damage was easily repaired, and, in 1860, the new church was\r\nopened to the public. It is Gothic in style and the interior\r\nconsists of three naves. It has the form of an irregular cross.\r\nThe pulpit is a handsome design with its statues and turrets. In\r\nthe transept are four paintings, the work of E. Cabane, a French\r\nartist: “Our Lady of the Rosary,” “The Education of the Virgin,”\r\n“The Death of St. Joseph,” and “The Holy Family.” The steeple is\r\nthe bequest of the city and contains a very fine chime of bells.\r\nThe entrance on St. Catherine Street is a splendid piece of\r\narchitectural work and looks spacious in its framework of trees\r\nand terraces.\r\n\r\nWhen the parishes were created in 1866 to supplement the Parish\r\nof Notre Dame, mother to the sole parish church, St. James became\r\nthe second parish church.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       OUR LADY OF LOURDES\r\n\r\n                     (St. Catherine Street)\r\n\r\nClose by the Church of St. James is the chapel of Our Lady of\r\nLourdes dedicated to the Immaculate Virgin of Massabielle. It is\r\na charming specimen of Canadian religious art. It was built under\r\nthe supervision of the late Father Lenoir, with the generous\r\ncooperation of the Seminary of St. Sulpice and the Catholics\r\nof the City. The style of architecture is Byzantine and in art\r\nit is of the Renaissance order. The gallery is divided by an\r\nexquisitely beautiful rose-window. A nicely gilt statue of the\r\nBlessed Virgin has been placed on the dome and the crown of\r\nstars on its head is brilliantly lighted up at night by means\r\nof an ingenious electrical device. The alternate layers of\r\nwhite marble and grey stone give the front an attractive look.\r\nThe central dome, thirty-five feet in diameter and 120 feet in\r\nheight, looks down upon the nave and transept. There are two\r\nchapels in the church. One is in the basement and is a good\r\nreproduction of the Grotto of Lourdes, with an altar where Mass\r\nmay be celebrated. The upper chapel is very richly decorated. Mr.\r\nN. Bourassa, the artist, has embodied in a series of beautiful\r\ntableaux the arguments of Catholic belief in the dogma of the\r\nImmaculate Conception of the Blessed Virgin. Among the subjects\r\ntreated, there is a fine scroll above the high altar, at the\r\nfirst arch, representing “The Annunciation;” there are also two\r\ntableaux in the arcades at each side of the altar: “The Crowning\r\nof the Virgin,” and “The Assumption;” the large compositions of\r\nthe transept: “The Adoration of the Magi” and “The Visit of\r\nSt. Elizabeth;” finally, “The Proclamation of the Dogma of the\r\nImmaculate Conception,” which takes up the whole interior of the\r\ndome.\r\n\r\nMass is celebrated and a sermon preached in this chapel every\r\nSunday of the academic year for the benefit of the students of\r\nLaval University.\r\n\r\nThis chapel is the meeting place of four sodalities of men,\r\nwomen, and young men and young women.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       RELIGIOUS CHURCHES\r\n\r\n                            THE GESU\r\n\r\nThe Gésu is the successor in order of time of the church built\r\nin 1692 on the site of the present courthouse and city hall.\r\nThis was burned in 1803. The Jesuits had left the colony after\r\nthe capitulation and their property was held by the government,\r\nbut in 1842 they were invited to return by Mgr. Bourget and in\r\nconsequence there arrived soon the Fathers Pierre Chazelle, Felix\r\nMartin, Remi Tellier, Paul Luiset, Joseph Hanipaux and Dominique\r\nDuranquet. Several undertook the charge of the curé of La Prairie\r\nand others were employed at the bishop’s house. In 1843 a\r\nnovitiate for future members was opened on July 31st in a little\r\nhouse adjoining the church at La Prairie and on September 9th it\r\nwas transferred for five years to a house loaned by Lieut.-Col.\r\nC.S. Rodier, who became mayor in 1858.\r\n\r\nIn 1845 a public meeting invited the Jesuits to build a residence\r\nand college in the city and in 1846 the present lands on Bleury\r\nStreet were sold at a very liberal price by Mr. John Donegani.\r\nBut owing to the typhus epidemic intervening in 1847-48 the\r\nbuilding was delayed. In the meantime the Fathers worked in\r\nthe fever sheds for the suffering Irish with six fathers who\r\ncame from New York and afterwards founded with the Seminary the\r\nfirst residence of St. Patricks, then situated at Nos. 57-59 St.\r\nAlexander Street. In 1850 the first stone of their college of\r\nSte. Marie was laid and on July 31, 1851, the college, with its\r\npublic chapel attached, was blessed. In 1851 their noviceship\r\nwas transferred hither and on August 5, 1853, it was again\r\ntransplanted to its present position at Sault au Recollet,\r\noutside the city.\r\n\r\nIn 1863, on October 22, M. Olivier Berthelet made a gift of an\r\narpent and a half (for which he had paid $20,000) for a church\r\nto be built after the model of the Gésu in Rome. The work was\r\ncommenced in the following year.\r\n\r\nThe Gésu, as it became to be called, is one of the finest\r\nspecimens of its kind. It is 194 feet long, 96 feet wide, the\r\ntransept 144 feet, and the nave 95 feet high. The style of\r\narchitecture, Renaissance and Florentine, is fascinating and\r\ngives the church an aspect of elegance and comfort. It is not\r\nunlike the Gesu at Rome in its appointments. Its collection of\r\nfine paintings and tableaux deserves a special mention. They\r\nimitate or complete the plastic work of the sacred edifice. They\r\nare, for the most part, copies of masterpieces of the modern\r\nGerman School and are the work of Mr. Miller. Among its many rich\r\nchapels, one in particular attracts the attention of the visitor,\r\non account of an old statue it possesses. It is under the gallery\r\nto the right of the main altar and is known as the Chapel of\r\nOur Lady of Liesse. A reliquary over the tabernacle contains\r\nthe ashes of the statue of Our Lady of Liesse, which was burned\r\nduring the French Revolution. Two large tableaux which are on\r\neither side of the sanctuary represent St. Aloysius and St.\r\nStanislaus Kostka in the attitude of receiving Holy Communion,\r\nthe former from the hands of St. Charles Borromeo and the latter\r\nfrom an Angel. There are two smaller paintings over the altars\r\nof the Blessed Virgin and St. Joseph: “The Holy Family” and “The\r\nFlight into Egypt.” These remarkable paintings are from the\r\nstudio of Cagliardi Bros., Rome.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           ST. PETER’S\r\n\r\nMontreal is the headquarters of several religious orders of men.\r\nBesides the Jesuits there are numerous others who are devoted\r\neither to the ministry or education, or to both. One of the first\r\ncommunities to be invited were the Oblates of Mary Immaculate,\r\nan order founded at Aix in Provence on January 25, 1816, by Mgr.\r\nde Mazenod, bishop of Marseilles. In 1841 four Oblates reached\r\nMontreal, Fathers Honorat (Superior), Telmont, Baudrand and\r\nLagier. Their settlement was first at St. Hilaire de Rouville,\r\nthen at Longueuil. In 1848 a provisory chapel in wood was built\r\nin the Faubourg de Quebec (Quebec Suburbs). In 1851 the first\r\nstone of the new church of St. Peter, on the same spot, on\r\nVisitation Street, was laid. From this first home there went\r\nforth the first missionaries of the modern Canadian Northwest.\r\nTo this order the Rev. Albert Lacombe, the northwest missionary,\r\nbecame early attached.\r\n\r\nSt. Peter’s has three naves of equal height. The sanctuary is\r\nlighted by large arched, stained-glass windows, which produce a\r\nmagnificent effect. The white marble altar is surmounted by a\r\nturreted reredos and is shown to advantage by numberless electric\r\nbulbs most ingeniously adapted. St. Peter’s is one of the best\r\nproportioned churches of the City. The stained-glass windows of\r\nthe sanctuary and side aisles are most attractive. They are from\r\nthe factory of Champigneulle of Bar-le-Duc, France. The Sacred\r\nHeart altar is a rare work of art with its handsome candlesticks\r\nand its tabernacle door of gilded bronze.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    ENGLISH CATHOLIC CHURCHES\r\n\r\n                          ST. PATRICK’S\r\n\r\nEspecial notice should be given to the origin of the\r\nEnglish-speaking Catholics of the city. Although before 1800\r\na few Irish immigrants sought a home in the city, the history\r\nproper of the Irish population of Montreal starts in 1817, when\r\na Sulpician, the Rev. Father Richards-Jackson, commonly known\r\nas Rev. M. Richards, discovered a little band of worshipers\r\nfrom the Emerald Isle, driven thence by poverty and privation,\r\ngathering at Bonsecours church. A directory of 1819 only reveals\r\nabout thirty presumably Irish names.[2] In 1820 the number was\r\nstill so small that a visitor to Bonsecours Church stated that\r\n“he could have covered with a good-sized parlour carpet all the\r\nIrish Catholics worshipping there on Sundays.” Yet the number of\r\nIrish orphans were so great that by 1823 the “Salle des Petites\r\nIrlandaises” was opened in the Grey Nuns’ hospital and supported\r\nby the Gentlemen of the Seminary. Soon the complement of forty\r\nwas reached. But by 1831, with the increase of immigration, the\r\nold “Récollet” church on Notre Dame Street, being considerably\r\nenlarged, was reopened for the use of the Irish Catholics of the\r\ncenter and western portions of the city, those of the eastern\r\nsection still remaining attached to Notre Dame de Bonsecours.\r\nThe Rev. Patrick Phelan, afterwards bishop, was the first Irish\r\npastor. The Irish soldiers of the garrison met principally at the\r\nnew Notre Dame church opened in 1829. Soon the “Récollet” became\r\ninadequate. On Sundays it was so overcrowded with devout Irish\r\nthat the overflow knelt in the rain or the sunshine on Notre Dame\r\nStreet or Dollard Lane. This was to be remedied by the steps\r\ntaken on May 20, 1843, to purchase land for a church to be named\r\nSt. Patrick’s, the present area of St. Patrick’s Church and the\r\nSt. Bridget’s Home being secured by the Fabrique of Notre Dame\r\nfrom the Rocheblave family for £5,000. On the 26th of September\r\nthe cornerstones were blessed by Bishop Bourget. They were seven\r\nin number and were laid by the following: First, by Bishop\r\nBourget; second, by the mayor; third, by the speaker of the\r\nassembly; fourth, by the chief justice; fifth, by the president\r\nof the Irish Temperance Association; sixth, by the president of\r\nSt. Patrick’s Society; seventh, by the president of the Hibernian\r\nBenevolent Society.\r\n\r\nOn the 17th of March, St. Patrick’s Day, 1847, the church of St.\r\nPatrick’s was dedicated. The first patron of St. Patrick’s was\r\nthe Rev. J.J. Connolly, who had succeeded Father Phelan at the\r\n“Recollet” when the latter had been consecrated coadjutor bishop\r\nof Kingston in 1843.\r\n\r\nFather Connolly nobly served the typhus-stricken emigrants in\r\n1847 for a period of six weeks or more, consigning to the silent\r\ngrave more than fifty adult persons a day. At this time Father\r\nRichards and Father Morgan died martyrs of charity. In this\r\nministration, therefore, the Seminary called in the services of\r\nfive Jesuit Fathers who laboured at St. Patricks for some years\r\ntill the Seminary was able to provide its own members. The Rev.\r\nJ.J. Connolly left St. Patricks in 1860 for Boston, where he died\r\nthree years later, on the 16th of September, 1863, at the age\r\nof forty-seven years. He was succeeded by Father Dowd, who had\r\nbeen transferred with Rev. Father O’Brien, McCullough and others\r\nfor service here from Ireland about 1848 at the request of M.\r\nQuiblier, superior of the Seminary.\r\n\r\nIn 1887, on the occasion of Father Dowd’s celebration of his\r\nfiftieth year of priesthood, the occasion was taken by every\r\nsection of the community to testify its appreciation of his work\r\nas the pastor of St. Patrick’s and as a good citizen.\r\n\r\nHe commenced the St. Patrick’s Orphan Asylum, opened in November,\r\n1851. In 1863 he established St. Bridget’s Home for the Old and\r\nInfirm and the Night Refuge for the Destitute, and in 1866-7\r\nerected the building on Lagauchetière Street for a home and\r\nrefuge. In 1872 he established the St. Patrick’s School for Girls\r\non St. Alexander Street. In 1877 he organized the great Irish\r\nCanadian pilgrimage to Rome.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FRANCISCAN CHURCH]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: NOTRE DAME DE LOURDES CHURCH]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE JESUITS CHURCH AND ST. MARY’S COLLEGE]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ST. PATRICK’S CHURCH]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ST. JACQUES CHURCH]\r\n\r\nThe position of St. Patrick’s as a national church for the Irish\r\nwas jeopardized in 1866, when the dismemberment of the ancient\r\nparish of Notre Dame was proclaimed. St. Patrick’s would have\r\nbecome in the new division a general district, one for use by\r\nFrench-Canadians, but on the representations of Father Dowd to\r\nthe Holy See, the national privileges were confirmed to the\r\nchurch. Each succeeding pastor of St. Patrick’s has done much to\r\nthe beautifying of this church, one of the purest specimens of\r\nthe Gothic style in Canada. Its outside dimensions are: Length,\r\n233 feet; width, 105 feet; inside height from floor to ceiling,\r\n85 feet. The steeple is 228 feet high. The work of renovation\r\nof the interior of St. Patrick’s was carried out in 1893 under\r\nthe late Father Quinlivan, S.S. pastor. Under the present\r\npastor, the Rev. Gerald McShane, S.S., the parish has seen great\r\nimprovements, notably those at the Eucharistic Congress of 1910\r\nwhen the grounds adjoining the church and partially occupied\r\nhitherto by St. Bridget’s Orphanage were tastefully laid out\r\nas a semi-public garden. At this same time there took place\r\nthe development of the chimes of St. Patrick’s. The following\r\nreproduction of the inscriptions on the memorial tables placed in\r\nthe church tells its story:\r\n\r\n                 AS A PERPETUAL MEMORIAL OF THE\r\n             XXI INTERNATIONAL EUCHARISTIC CONGRESS,\r\n               AT MONTREAL, SEPT 7-11, A.D. 1910,\r\n     AND IN LASTING REMEMBRANCE OF THE SOLEMN CONGRESS MASS\r\n           AND THE PRESENCE OF THE CARDINAL LEGATE IN\r\n          SAINT PATRICK’S CHURCH, SEPT. 10, WAS ERECTED\r\n                        A CHIME OF BELLS,\r\n  BLESSED WITH IMPOSING LITURGICAL RITES, MAY 15, 1910, BY THE\r\n                  MOST REVEREND PAUL BRUCHESI,\r\n                     ARCHBISHOP OF MONTREAL.\r\n\r\n      “Ring out, sweet chime, from Gothic tower!\r\n        “A people’s faith thy belfry knells;\r\n      “At Matins, Lauds, and Vesper Hour,\r\n        “Peal forth our joy, sweet Congress Bells.”\r\n\r\n\r\n            TO COMMEMORATE THE RESTORATION AND SOLEMN\r\n                DEDICATION OF THE HISTORIC BELL,\r\n                           CHARLOTTE,\r\n          CAST IN WHITECHAPEL FOUNDRY, LONDON, ENGLAND,\r\n                           A.D. 1774;\r\n          FIRST PLACED IN NOTRE DAME, AND PRESENTED TO\r\n                    ST.

The Celtic Cross\r\npredominates in the decorations of the arches and walls. There\r\nare some fine paintings in the sanctuary and on the side walls.\r\n“The Annunciation” and the “Death of St. Joseph” are very fine.\r\nUnder St. Joseph’s altar is a life-sized figure of the Apostle\r\nof Ireland, attired in the pontifical vestments of the sixth\r\ncentury. The paintings of the Way of the Cross are works of art.\r\nThe stained-glass windows are admirable. A series of painted\r\npanels ornaments the upper part of the wainscoting. The oak\r\nconfessionals and pews are pretty in design. The harmonious\r\ncombination is pleasing to the eye and gives the interior a\r\npicturesqueness of original conception.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            ST. ANN’S\r\n\r\nSt. Ann’s Parish, the fifth in point of age and the second Irish\r\nparish of Montreal, was founded by the Sulpician Fathers. In\r\nearly days, mass was celebrated in a brick house which is still\r\nstanding and used as a tenement on the corner of Ottawa and\r\nMurray streets. The present church was commenced in 1851, the\r\nblessing and laying of the foundation stone being on August 3d\r\nand the opening on December 8, 1854. The Redemptorist Fathers\r\ntook charge in 1884. The church which was found too small for the\r\ncongregation was lengthened thirty-two feet and a tower added to\r\nthe extension. In the tower is a fine chime of bells. Besides\r\nparochial work, the Fathers give missions throughout Canada and\r\nthe United States. The origin of the name of St. Ann’s dates back\r\nto 1698, when Pierre Le Ber, brother of the recluse, built a\r\nchapel at Point St. Charles to St. Anne. The first mass was said\r\non November 12, 1698.\r\n\r\nThe ruins of the chapel were still to be seen in 1823.\r\n\r\nThe subsequent English-speaking Catholic churches that followed\r\nSt. Patrick’s were founded in the following order:\r\n\r\n1854, St. Ann’s, 32 Basin Street, served by the Redemptorist\r\nFathers since 1884; 1875, St. Gabriel’s; 1884, St. Anthony’s;\r\n1889, St. Mary (Our Lady of Good Counsel); 1902, St. Michael’s;\r\n1903, St. Agnes’; 1908, St. Aloysius’; 1908, St. Thomas Aquinas’;\r\n1912, St. Dominic’s; 1913, St. Willibrod’s.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              NOTE\r\n\r\n                      RELIGIOUS COMMUNITIES\r\n\r\nBesides the Diocesan clergy composed of “Secular” priests, an\r\nessential feature of Catholicism in Montreal is the number of\r\n“Religious” orders or “Congregations” of men and women, Montreal\r\nbeing in many cases, especially of women organizations, the\r\nscene of the foundation and mother-house of numerous branch\r\nestablishments in various parts of the American continent.\r\n\r\nThe following lists will, therefore, be of value.

This\r\ndocument appears to be issued by the “Society for Propagating\r\nthe Gospel” on England. After the peace of 1762 it was thought\r\nadvisable by the English government to send some French\r\nProtestant clergymen who could minister to French Protestants,\r\nwhose number were greatly exaggerated. Accordingly, while M. de\r\nMontmolten was sent to Quebec and M. Veyssiere to Three Rivers,\r\nM. De Lisle came to Montreal. There was, of course, no church as\r\nthe account proceeds to say:\r\n\r\n“The minister at Montreal (who is also chaplain for the garrison)\r\nwhen he does officiate it is in the chapel of the Recollects\r\nConvent on Sunday mornings only and on Christmas day and Good\r\nFriday.” Again, “there is not a single Protestant church in the\r\nwhole province. The greater part of the inhabitants of Montreal\r\nare Presbyterians of the church of Scotland. These being weary of\r\nattending a minister (M. de Lisle) whom they did not understand\r\nand for other reasons, have established a Presbyterian minister\r\nand subscribed liberally to his support. His name is Bethune and\r\nhe was late chaplain of the Eighty-fourth Regiment, and while Mr.\r\nStuart assisted Mr. de Lisle (which he did for a short time) he\r\nused constantly to attend the service of our church.”\r\n\r\nEven on the arrival of the first Protestant bishop for the\r\ncountry, Doctor Mountain, who was made Bishop of Quebec about\r\n1793, there were but nine Protestant clergymen in Canada. In the\r\nfirst years the duty was performed by the military and naval\r\nchaplains. In 1766 the Rev. D.C. De Lisle, a Swiss Protestant,\r\nwas appointed rector of Montreal; hitherto, as said, he had acted\r\nas chaplain for the regiment. A minister was appointed for Three\r\nRivers in 1768 and one for Sorel in 1783. In 1784 the Loyalists,\r\nestablishing themselves in the north of the St. Lawrence and\r\nfounding the Modern Ontario, chaplains were appointed for New\r\nOswegatchie (Prescott), New Johnstone (Cornwall), and Kingston\r\n(Cataraqui).\r\n\r\nThe first Episcopal visitation of an Anglican prelate took place\r\nin Canada in 1787, Dr. Inglis, the first bishop of Nova Scotia,\r\nand then the only bishop in Canada, being appointed on August\r\n12, 1787. He arrived at Quebec on June 11th. After a fortnight’s\r\nvisitation he ascended the river, visiting Three Rivers, Sorel\r\nand Montreal. At Montreal he found that a part of the Récollect\r\nChurch was kindly loaned at certain hours for the Protestant\r\nservices. The city Protestants urged the Bishop to obtain\r\npermission from the government for the Jesuits church, now in its\r\nhands, the order being suppressed and the church falling into\r\ndisrepair. The Governor, Lord Dorchester, agreed to place the\r\nbuilding in good repair, but the interior of the pews were to be\r\nfitted up by the congregation. He proposed that the church be\r\ncalled Christ Church. We may call this the establishment of the\r\nChurch of England in Montreal.\r\n\r\nChrist Church was opened for service on December 20, 1789, when\r\nthe sermon was preached by Mr. De Lisle. Mr. De Lisle died\r\nin 1794, being succeeded by the Rev. James Tunstall, who was\r\nfollowed in 1801 by the Reverend Dr. Mountain, brother of the\r\nRev. Jacob Mountain, who had been appointed in 1793 to the new\r\nAnglican see of Quebec. In June, 1803, the church was destroyed\r\nby fire. A building committee was appointed, consisting of Doctor\r\nMountain, the Hon. James McGill, George Ogden and the Messrs.\r\nRoss, Gray, Frobisher and Sewell. The site of the old French\r\nprison (about where No. 23 Notre Dame Street, West, now stands)\r\nwas granted by the government. The cornerstone was laid in 1805.\r\nMeanwhile the Scotch Presbyterian Church of St. Gabriel’s, which\r\nhad been erected since 1792, was loaned for services. On the 9th\r\nof October, 1814, after much delay, the new Christ Church was\r\nopened and dedicated. Doctor Mountain died in 1816 and the Rev.\r\nJohn Leeds succeeded. On his resignation in 1818 the Rev. John\r\nBethune was presented by the king as rector under letters patent,\r\nwhich created a rectory and defined the limits of the parish.\r\nThus Christ Church became the Anglican Mother Church of the city.\r\n\r\nIn 1850 Montreal was made a diocesan see and the Rev. Francis\r\nFulford was appointed by letters patent the first bishop, and\r\nChrist Church was named his cathedral. These two seats of letters\r\npatent were the beginning of a long dispute as to the limitations\r\nof authority within the cathedral. Bishop Fulford was enthroned\r\nin Christ Church on September 15th of that year. In 1853 Doctor\r\nBethune became the first dean of Montreal. In 1856, on the night\r\nof December 10th, the first cathedral was totally destroyed by\r\nfire; the tablets to the memory of the Hon. John Richardson,\r\nnow in the east transept of the present edifice, and the copy\r\nof Leonardo da Vinci’s Last Supper, now hung on the south wall,\r\nbeing among the few objects saved. A new building committee,\r\nof which the Hon. George Moffatt and Chief Justice McCord were\r\nleading members, then set to work. The present site of the\r\ncathedral was chosen, in spite of those who thought it was too\r\nfar from the city, and in 1859, on November 27th, the beautiful\r\nGothic cathedral, one of the most handsome of its kind on the\r\ncontinent, was opened for worship. In the interval, Gosford\r\nStreet church was appropriated for worship under the name of\r\nSt. John’s Chapel. In 1867 the Cathedral was consecrated by the\r\nMetropolitan Bishop Fulford. The rectory house was completed in\r\n1877. In 1901 the cathedral act was promoted defining the rights\r\nof the rector, the bishop, the archbishop and the primate within\r\nthe cathedral, and the duties of the cathedral chapter. The\r\nfollowing is a list of the rectors of Christ Church and Christ\r\nChurch Cathedral: 1789, Rev. D.C. De Lisle; 1791, Rev. James\r\nTunstall; 1801, Rev. Dr. Mountain; 1815, Rev. John Leeds; 1818,\r\nRev. John Bethune, afterwards dean; 1872, Rev. Maurice Baldwin,\r\nafterwards dean of Montreal and subsequently bishop of Huron;\r\n1884, Rev. J.G. Norton, subsequently archdeacon of Montreal;\r\nvicars in charge of the parish, 1902, Rev. F.J. Steen; 1903, Rev.\r\nHerbert Symonds.\r\n\r\nThe Anglican Bishopric of Montreal has its origin as follows:\r\n\r\nIn 1787 His Majesty, George III, had created Nova Scotia into\r\nan Episcopal see, the bishop of the diocese being also granted\r\njurisdiction, spiritual and ecclesiastical, over the province of\r\nQuebec as it then existed. In 1793 the bishopric of Quebec was\r\ncreated and curtailed the jurisdiction of Nova Scotia. The first\r\nbishop was the Rev. Dr. Jacob Mountain who was succeeded on his\r\ndeath, in 1826, by Bishop Stewart, a younger son of the Earl\r\nof Galloway, and when he died, in 1837, Dr. George Jehoshaphat\r\nMountain took charge of the extensive diocese. Dr. G.J. Mountain\r\nhad been appointed to assist the bishop of Quebec under the title\r\nof Bishop of Montreal, but he had no separate jurisdiction nor\r\nwas any see erected at Montreal. This was divided in 1839 by the\r\ncreation of a diocese of Toronto, in 1845 by that of Fredericton\r\nand by that of Montreal in 1850. The bishops of the diocese of\r\nMontreal from this date are: Francis Fulford, September 15, 1850,\r\nto September 9, 1868; Ashton Oxenden, August 31, 1869, to May 7,\r\n1878; William Bennett Bond, January 25, 1879, to October 9, 1906;\r\nJames Carmichael, November 4, 1906, to September 21, 1908; John\r\nFarthing, consecrated January 6, 1909.\r\n\r\nOf the earliest Anglican churches of the city, the Gosford\r\nStreet Church, now no longer existent, served as a temporary\r\nplace of worship for the Christ Church Cathedral congregation\r\nbetween 1856 and 1859 after the fire on Notre Dame Street and\r\nsaw many vicissitudes. It was purchased by Trinity Church\r\nCongregation in 1860 and used for worship till 1865. It then\r\nafterwards became the Dominion Theatre. Here Miss Emma Lajeunes\r\nof Chambly, afterwards famous as Madame Albani, made a debut\r\nas a plain piano player, for as yet she had not discovered the\r\npowers of her beautiful voice. In 1871 it was changed to “Debars\r\nOpera.” The Cercle Jacques Cartier, a dramatic organization of\r\nFrench-Canadian amateurs, who were the pioneers of the French\r\ntheatre in America, presented a number of plays there. In\r\n1889, the building passed into the hands of Mgr. Bourget, who\r\nplaced the property at the disposition of the Union Allet, an\r\norganization of Canadian Zouaves, who had fought for the temporal\r\npower of Pius IX. It then became a vinegar factory, and when\r\ndemolished was a carriage depot, and the site has now become, in\r\n1914, that of the City Hall Annex.\r\n\r\nThe original Trinity Church was built in 1840 on St. Paul Street,\r\nimmediately opposite the center of Bonsecours Market, at the\r\npersonal expense of Major William Plenderleath Christie, a son\r\nof General Christie of the “Royal Americans,” subsequently\r\ndesignated the Sixtieth Rifles. It was built on a lot 75 feet 6\r\ninches, more or less, in front, by 174 feet, more or less, in\r\ndepth. This church and its successor are proud of the military\r\nassociations surrounding it. The edifice is described as an\r\nelegant structure, built in the Gothic style, 75 feet long by\r\n44 wide. The first incumbent of the church was the Rev. Mark\r\nWilloughby. In 1860 the congregation of Trinity purchased the\r\nGosford Street Church, lately used by the Congregation of Christ\r\nChurch, under the title of St. John’s Chapel, and worshipped\r\nthere for five years. The old building on St. Paul Street\r\nwas torn down and the lot sold. In 1864 the Trinity Church\r\ncongregation secured the present site of the church at the\r\nnorthwest corner of Viger Square and St. Denis Street. The corner\r\nstone was laid on Thursday, June 23, 1864, by the Lord Bishop\r\nMetropolitan, Bishop Fulford. It was opened for public worship\r\nSeptember 17, 1865. It was consecrated on January 13, 1908, by\r\nBishop Farthing, being his first official act.\r\n\r\nThe predecessor of St. George’s Church was opened as a\r\nproprietary chapel on St. Joseph Street on June 30, 1843, with\r\nSt. George’s Society present in force. The present St. George’s\r\nChurch was built in 1870 at the corner of the streets then named\r\nSt. François de Sales and St. Janvier (now facing Dominion\r\nSquare). It was opened on October 9th of the same year.\r\n\r\nSt. Stephen’s Church on Dalhousie Street, Griffintown, was\r\nconsumed by the great fire of 1850. St. Luke’s Church, at the\r\ncorner of Champlain Street and Dorchester Street, East, was\r\nopened in 1854 and enlarged in 1864. The church of St. James,\r\nthe Apostle, had its foundation stone laid on July 4, 1853. Its\r\ncongregation was formed partly of that originally belonging to\r\nSt. Stephen’s church. St. John, the Evangelist, on Ontario and\r\nSt. Urbain streets, was built in 1860 and opened in 1861. St.\r\nThomas Church, corner of Sherbrooke, East, and Delorme Avenue,\r\nsucceeded the former church of the same name on Notre Dame and\r\nwas conducted by a clergyman of the Countess of Huntingdon’s\r\nConnexion, but opened for the regular Anglican clergy in 1866.\r\nSt. Mary’s Church (Hochelaga) dates from 1828, when a stone\r\nchurch was erected on Marlborough Street on a lot presented by a\r\nfarmer to the Rev. John Bethune, then rector of Christ Church.\r\nShortly after 1851 the church was closed, but was reopened in\r\n1861. In 1889 it was torn down and in 1891 the present church on\r\nthe corner of Préfontaine and Rouville streets was built. In the\r\nmeantime the congregation worshipped in a building at 321 Notre\r\nDame Street.\r\n\r\nOther Anglican churches are: St. Stephen’s Church, Weredale\r\nPark; St. Edward’s Church, corner of St. Paul and the Haymarket;\r\nSt. Martin’s Church, corner of St. Urbain and Prince Arthur\r\nstreets; St. Jude’s Church, corner of Coursol and Vinet streets;\r\nAll Saints Church, corner of St. Denis and Marie Anne streets,\r\nEast; St. Simon’s Church, corner of Courcelles Street and Notre\r\nDame Street. West: Eglise du Rédempteur, corner Sherbrooke and\r\nCartier streets; Grace Church, 715 Wellington Street; Church\r\nof the Advent, corner of Wood Avenue and Western Avenue,\r\nWestmount; Church of the Redeemer; St. Clement’s Belcher\r\nMemorial Church, Gordon Avenue and Wellington Street, Verdun;\r\nthe Bishop Carmichael Memorial Church, corner of St. Zotique and\r\nChateaubriand streets; Church of the Good Shepherd, corner of\r\nClaremont and Sherbrooke Street; St. Cyprian’s Church, corner Pie\r\nIX Avenue and Adam Street, Maisonneauve; St. Augustine’s Church,\r\ncorner of Dandereau Street and Fourth Avenue, Westmount; St.\r\nMargaret’s Church, Longue Pointe Ward.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CHRIST CHURCH CATHEDRAL]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ST. ANDREWS CHURCH]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SPANISH AND PORTUGESE JEWISH SYNAGOGUE]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: OLIVET BAPTIST CHURCH]\r\n\r\nThe Anglican Missions are as follows: St. Thomas Mission, held in\r\nDelorme schoolroom; St. Cuthbert’s Mission, corner of Beaumont\r\nand King Edward Boulevard; St. Hilda’s Mission, Marquette Street;\r\nSt. Aidan’s Mission, Hamilton Avenue.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          PRESBYTERIANS\r\n\r\nPresbyterianism, according to the Rev. Dr. Robert Campbell,\r\nin his history of St. Gabriel’s Street Church, started in\r\nMontreal in a room in St. Lawrence Suburbs on March 12, 1786,\r\nwhen the meeting for the organization of the first Presbyterian\r\ncongregation took place. Most of those present were Scotch\r\nsoldiers of the old Seventy-Eighth, or Fraser Highlanders, who\r\nhad fought the campaign leading to the conquest of Canada at the\r\ncapitulation of Montreal in 1760. After the peace of 1763 a large\r\nproportion of the Highlanders elected to stay in the country,\r\nmany settling round Montreal and its district. When the North\r\nWest Company was organized these men were of the same metal as\r\nthat adventurous Gaelic band, and of the men now gathered, some\r\n“as youths had been actually engaged in the fight at Culloden\r\nin 1745, while several were the children or the descendants of\r\nthose brave men who had stood on the side of ‘Prince Charlie’\r\non that fated field.” The organizer was the Rev. John Bethune,\r\nan ex-chaplain of the Eighty-Fourth Regiment who, however, left\r\nMontreal in 1787. His son, the Rev. John Bethune, an Anglican,\r\nbecame afterwards famous as the first principal of McGill\r\nUniversity, from 1835 to 1852.\r\n\r\nFrom May, 1787, till 1790 there exists no records of services\r\nheld according to Presbyterian forms. They seem as said to have\r\nfollowed those of the “Rector of the Parish of Montreal and\r\nChaplain of the Garrison,” the Rev. David Chatbrand De Lisle,\r\na Swiss who spoke English indifferently. The first regular\r\nPresbyterian minister was the Rev. John Young, from Schenectady,\r\nwho was a stormy petrel, but he did good work for eleven years at\r\nMontreal. It was he who organized the erection of St. Gabriel’s\r\nStreet Church, the first regular Protestant Church in Old\r\nCanada, prior to 1867, for that chapel erected at Berthier six\r\nyears earlier by James Cuthbert, seigneur of Berthier, a Scotch\r\nPresbyterian, is claimed to have been only in the nature of a\r\nprivate domestic chapel attached to his seigneurial manor. In the\r\ninterval between 1786 and 1792, occasional services were held in\r\nthe government property known as the old Jesuit Church, which was\r\nalso being shared by the Anglicans prior to the erection of the\r\nfirst Christ Church.\r\n\r\nThe land was bought on St. Gabriel Street on April 2, 1792.\r\nUntil the church was built the Récollet Fathers allowed the\r\nuse of their church to the “Society of Presbyterians,” also\r\nfor occasional services. The fathers refused any remuneration,\r\nbut were induced to accept a present of two hogsheads of\r\nSpanish wine, containing sixty-odd gallons, each, and a box of\r\ncandles, amounting in all to £14-2-4. The “Scotch Church,” “the\r\nProtestant Presbyterian Church” or “the Presbyterian Church of\r\nMontreal,” as it was variously called at the time, was built in\r\n1792, Messrs. Telfer and McIntosh executing the mason work and\r\nMr. Joseph Perrault the carpentry work.\r\n\r\nThe Rev. Mr. Young’s committee were elected on May 8, 1791, to\r\narrange the “temporals” of the congregation, and were mostly good\r\nScotch traders, viz.: Messrs. Richard Dobie, Alex. Henry, Adam\r\nScott, William Stewart, Alex. Fisher, John Lilly, William Hunter,\r\nDuncan Fisher, William England, Alex. Hannah, Peter McFarlane,\r\nGeorge Kay, John Robb, Thomas Baker, John Empey, John Russell. Of\r\nthese nine were to be sufficient to form a quorum.\r\n\r\nThe list of subscribers to the church building fund reveals the\r\nnames of most of the principal merchants at this time, as well as\r\nthose of the “Gentlemen of the North West,” so that St. Gabriel’s\r\nwas a weighty congregation. But although Protestants, the\r\nworshippers were not all Scotch or Presbyterians. Doctor Campbell\r\npoints out John Gregory, Joseph Frobisher, Benaiah Gibb, Thomas\r\nBaker, John Molson, James Woolrich, J.A. Gray, Thomas Busby, R.\r\nBrooks and John Gray, as Englishmen; Sir John Johnson, Andrew\r\nTodd, Thomas Sullivan, Isaac Todd and John Neagles, Irishmen;\r\nJohn J. Deihl and Andrew Winclefoss, Germans; J.H. Germain and\r\nFrançois Deslard, Frenchmen; Hannah Empey and Peter Pangman, New\r\nEngland Loyalists, the others being Scots either by birth or\r\ndescent, some Highlanders, others Lowlanders.\r\n\r\nA portion separated from the Mother Church and formed a\r\ncongregation for themselves on St. Peter Street in 1804, building\r\na church in 1807 opposite to St. Sacrament Street. This was\r\ncontinued by St. Andrew’s (Beaver Hall Hill) Church, opened in\r\n1851. It was then thought to be a long way from the city. It was\r\nburnt down in 1869, but was shortly afterwards restored to the\r\noriginal plan.\r\n\r\nThe next off-shoot from St. Gabriel’s was the predecessor of the\r\npresent church of St. Paul, erected in 1834 in St. Helen Street,\r\nat the corner of Récollet Street, which in 1867 was sold and\r\ntaken down, and a new church built on the corner of Dorchester\r\nStreet and St. Geneviève Street. During the interval the\r\ncongregation worshipped in the Belmont Street Normal School below.\r\n\r\nThe above scissions had been merely local and physical. But the\r\ngreatest crisis in the history of the old church of St. Gabriel\r\nwas caused by the great constitutional Free Church controversy,\r\nbeing agitatedly carried on in the parent church of Scotland\r\nand necessarily duplicated in the loyal colonial presbytery of\r\nMontreal. So that from 1830 bitter and personal rancours cleft\r\nthe community.\r\n\r\nThe crisis was brought about by the Rev. Henry Esson, of St.\r\nGabriel’s Street Church, who seceded about 1844 from the Synod\r\nof Canada in connection with the church of Scotland. The\r\nmembers who desired to remain with St. Gabriel’s still clave\r\nto the old ways and claimed the Church property, but did not\r\ngain possession of it till 1864, but those who followed the\r\nRev. Henry Esson, being the majority--claimed and occupied the\r\ntemporals on the ground that St. Gabriel’s had never been held\r\nin connection with the Established Church of Scotland. But this\r\ncontention finally failed, for in 1864 St. Gabriel’s reverted to\r\nthe Church of Scotland on the decision of Government. At this\r\ntime of the scission of 1843-4 the “Free Church Committee,”\r\nwhich had been formed in the city from different Presbyterian\r\nchurches, consisted of John Redpath, chairman: James R. Orr,\r\nDavid and Archibald Ferguson, A. McGown, James Morrison, William\r\nHutchison, Alexander Fraser, Donald Fraser, Evander McIvor,\r\nWilliam Bethune and William McIntosh. The object was to form a\r\nchurch in connection with the Free Church of Scotland.\r\n\r\nWriting in 1893, Mr. John Sterling, an adherent of the Free Kirk\r\nmovement, speaks of the memorable conflict in the Established\r\nChurch of Scotland, or the non-intrusion question and its\r\nrelation to the movement in Montreal which resulted in the Coté\r\nStreet Free Church.\r\n\r\n  This conflict lasted for about ten years, and culminated in the\r\n  disruption of the church, on the 18th day of May, 1843, when 474\r\n  of its ministers and missionaries, for conscience sake, severed\r\n  their connection with it, and constituted themselves into a body\r\n  called the “Free Church of Scotland,” giving up their churches,\r\n  their manses, their livings, and risking every worldly prospect,\r\n  going forth with their wives and families, not knowing what might\r\n  befall them, but with a clear conscience, trusting in God for the\r\n  future, whatever it might be--one of the noblest sacrifices for\r\n  principle that the world has ever seen.\r\n\r\n  During all the time of the conflict, many of the members of\r\n  the Presbyterian churches of this city, in connection with the\r\n  Established Church of Scotland, strongly sympathized with the\r\n  non-intrusion movement, and on the disruption taking place,\r\n  considered it their duty to manifest their sympathy with the\r\n  Free Church principles. At that time (1843-44) there were five\r\n  Presbyterian Churches in this city, viz.: St. Gabriel’s Street\r\n  Church, St. Andrew’s Church, St. Paul’s Church, Lagauchetiere\r\n  Street Church, and the American Presbyterian Church, the first\r\n  three of which were in connection with the Established Church of\r\n  Scotland. The first concerted movement in this direction took\r\n  place on the 10th day of January, 1844, when twelve ardent and\r\n  good men, who might well be called the twelve apostles of the\r\n  Free Church in Canada, met together and called themselves the\r\n  Free Church Committee, others joining them afterwards, their\r\n  object being to extend and propagate Free Church principles. The\r\n  ultimate result of the work of this committee was that in May,\r\n  1845, a new Presbyterian congregation was formed in Montreal,\r\n  which worshipped for a time in a wooden building on Lagauchetiere\r\n  Street, near the head of Cote Street, which had been hastily\r\n  and cheaply erected, being only intended to accommodate the\r\n  congregation temporarily, until the projected new church to be\r\n  built on Cote Street should be ready for occupation.\r\n\r\n  At this time (1845) this locality was most respectable and quite\r\n  uptown, and the new church which was proposed to be erected\r\n  there, turned out to be the largest and finest Presbyterian\r\n  church building of its day in the city. It was opened for public\r\n  worship on Sabbath, the 16th day of May, 1848, and the name\r\n  chosen for it was the “Free Church, Coté Street.”\r\n\r\n  The population of the city had increased threefold, and the\r\n  character of the locality by 1877 had entirely changed. The\r\n  Protestant part of the population had mostly removed westwards to\r\n  an inconvenient distance from the church, and the remnant were\r\n  gradually moving away in the same direction, and the consequent\r\n  dropping off of families and members, who were joining churches\r\n  much more convenient to their dwellings, made the absolute\r\n  necessity of the removing the church building westwards, quite\r\n  apparent.\r\n\r\n  Consequently it was then decided to build uptown and the Crescent\r\n  Street Presbyterian Church was commenced early in the fall of\r\n  1876, the corner-stone being laid on May 5, 1877, and the church\r\n  being opened for service on March 10, 1878.\r\n\r\nBeside the Coté Street secession from St. Gabriel’s which is\r\nnow continued by the Crescent Street Church, the Knox Church\r\norganization is now to be described: The free church movement in\r\nCanada ended in a secession, not a disruption. Accordingly after\r\nthe dispute relating to the temporals of St. Gabriel’s Street\r\nChurch the seceding body in 1864 agreed to retire and formed\r\nthe session of Knox church. This held its last meeting in St.\r\nGabriel’s Street Church on July 31, 1865, and the last meeting of\r\nthe Knox congregation for worship there was on October 31, 1865.\r\nThe Knox Church at the corner of Mansfield and Dorchester Street\r\nwas opened for divine service December 3, 1865. According to the\r\nReverend Doctor Campbell this church represents _de facto_, but\r\nnot _de jure_, the original congregation established in 1786.\r\n\r\nThe St. Gabriel’s Street Church was sold to the Government in\r\n1886 and the congregation migrated to the New St. Gabriel’s\r\nChurch on St. Catherine Street opposite the present St. James\r\nMethodist Church. This was demolished in 1909. St. Gabriel’s\r\nlegitimate successor is the First Presbyterian Church at the\r\ncorner of Prince Arthur and Mance streets.\r\n\r\nIntervening between the Presbyterian Church of Scotland and\r\nthe Free Kirk Secession, there remains to be chronicled the\r\nsettlement of the American Presbyterian church in Montreal which\r\narose originally through the secession from St. Gabriel’s Street\r\nChurch in 1803, and later through a succession from Mr. Easton’s\r\nchurch on St. Peter Street which by a change of name in 1824\r\nbecame the first St. Andrew’s Church.\r\n\r\nThe American Presbyterian Church was the result of the minority\r\nof Mr. Easton’s church on St. Peter Street becoming offended\r\nat the resolution of the majority to procure a minister of the\r\nEstablished Church of Scotland, withdrawing from what henceforth\r\nbecame St. Andrew’s Church, so that a new congregation was formed\r\non December 15, 1822. This organized the first church at the\r\ncorner of St. James Street and Victoria Square, which was opened\r\non December 1, 1826. It was called “American” because it was\r\nrecognized by the Presbytery of New York, as under its care on\r\nMarch 23, 1823; otherwise it was Canadian in the composition of\r\nits membership. The second church, that of today, on Dorchester\r\nStreet, was opened on June 24, 1866.\r\n\r\nIt is not necessary to pursue further the story of the various\r\noff-shoots of the Presbyterian churches. Suffice it to say that\r\nin June, 1875, in Montreal the Presbyterian church of Canada, in\r\nconnection with the Church of Scotland, the Canada Presbyterian\r\nChurch of the Lower provinces, the Presbyterian Church of the\r\nMaritime provinces, in connection with the Church of Scotland,\r\nunited and became the General Assembly of the Presbyterian\r\nChurch in Canada. The St. Andrew’s Church remained, however, in\r\nconnection with the Church of Scotland.\r\n\r\nThe Presbyterian churches in the city today are: St. Andrew’s\r\nChurch (Church of Scotland), Beaver Hall Hill; St. Paul’s Church,\r\ncorner of Dorchester West and St. Monique Street; the American\r\nPresbyterian Church, corner of Dorchester and Drummond streets;\r\nKnox Church, Dorchester Street, West, corner of Mansfield\r\nStreet; St. John’s Church (French Presbyterian), St. Catherine\r\nand Cadieux streets; St. Mathew’s Church, corner of Bourgeoys\r\nand Wellington streets; Calvin Presbyterian Church, 946 Notre\r\nDame West; First Presbyterian Church, corner of Prince Arthur\r\nand St. Lawrence Boulevard; Erskine Church, Sherbrooke Street,\r\nWest, corner of Ontario Avenue; Crescent Street Presbyterian\r\nChurch, corner of Dorchester Street, West and Crescent Street;\r\nStanley Street Church, 96 Stanley Street, near Windsor Hotel;\r\nSt. Mark’s Presbyterian Church, William and Dalhousie streets;\r\nTaylor Church, Papineau Avenue and Logan Street; St. Giles\r\nPresbyterian Church, St. Denis, corner of St. Joseph Boulevard;\r\nVictoria Church, corner of Conway and Menai streets; Westminster\r\nPresbyterian Church, Atwater Avenue, Westmount; Montreal West\r\nPresbyterian Church; Melville Presbyterian Church, Elgin Avenue,\r\nWestmount Park; St. Andrew’s Presbyterian Church, Stanton Street\r\nand Coté St. Antoine Road; Maisonneuve Presbyterian Church,\r\ncorner of Letourneux Avenue and Adam Street, Maisonneuve; Salem\r\nWelsh Presbyterian Church, Alexandra Rooms, 314 St. Catherine,\r\nWest; Fairmount Presbyterian Church, corner of Masson and\r\nPapineau streets; McVicar Memorial Church, St. Viateur Avenue,\r\nWest, corner of Hutchinson Street; Verdun Presbyterian Church, 47\r\nRoss Street, Verdun.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: AMERICAN PRESBYTERIAN CHURCH]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: EMANUEL CONGREGATIONAL CHURCH]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ST. JAMES METHODIST CHURCH]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ST. GEORGE’S CHURCH (EPISCOPAL)]\r\n\r\nPresbyterian missions are: Nazareth Street Mission, corner of\r\nWellington and Nazareth streets; St. Paul’s Mission, 184 St.\r\nCharles Street.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         THE METHODISTS\r\n\r\nThe first chapel of the Wesleyan Methodists, opened in 1809, was\r\nsituated on St. Joseph Street, afterwards called St. Sulpice. In\r\n1821 the Congregation moved to the corner of St. François Xavier\r\nand St. James streets, when the old chapel became the first\r\npublic newsroom of Montreal. In 1845 the Great St. James Street\r\nMethodist Church was erected with an entrance on St. James Street\r\nand two on Fortification Lane. This church was burnt down. In\r\nthe meantime a Methodist church had been erected in Griffintown,\r\ncalled the Ottawa Street Church, on Wellington Street, close\r\nto where Duke Street now stands. This was also burnt down and\r\nit was replaced in 1846 by the church on the corner of St.\r\nAnn and Ottawa streets. In 1845 another church was opened on\r\nLagauchetière Street, at the corner of Durham Street. In 1857, in\r\nAugust, the new Connexion Methodist Salem Chapel on Panet Street\r\nwas opened, followed on September 26, 1858, by Ebenezer Chapel,\r\non Dupré Street. In 1864, there was a movement, for expansion\r\namong the Wesleyan Methodist body, which had for its result the\r\nSherbrooke Street Church, corner of St. Charles Borromee and\r\nSherbrooke Street, West, of which the foundation stone was laid\r\non July 5, 1864, and the opening occurred on May 21, 1865. The\r\nfoundation stone of the Dorchester Street Church, corner of\r\nWindsor Street and the Point St. Charles Church on Wellington\r\nStreet, were laid on Saturday, October 1, 1864. The Centenary\r\nMethodist Church was built in 1865 at the corner of Wellington\r\nStreet and was rebuilt in 1891 at the corner of Charron and\r\nWellington streets.\r\n\r\nThe other Methodist churches in the city are, St. James Methodist\r\nChurch (St. Catherine Street, corner of St. Alexander Street);\r\nMountain Street Methodist Church (corner of Mountain and Torrance\r\nStreet); Douglas Methodist Church (corner of Chomedy and St.\r\nCatherine Street, West); Dominion Square Methodist Church\r\n(Dorchester Street, corner of Windsor); West End Methodist Church\r\n(corner of Canning and Coursel Street); East End Methodist\r\nChurch (corner Cartier and DeMartigny streets); Fairmount Avenue\r\nMethodist Church (corner of Hutchison Street and Fairmount\r\nAvenue, West); Marlborough Street Methodist Church; Mount Royal\r\nAvenue Methodist Church; Ebenezer Methodist Church (corner of St.\r\nAntoine and Convent streets); Westmount Methodist Church (corner\r\nof Lansdowne Avenue and Western Avenue); Verdun Methodist Church\r\n(86 Gordon Avenue, Verdun); Huntley Street Methodist Church\r\n(Huntley Street near St. Zotique Street); First French Methodist\r\nChurch (services held in the lecture room of St. James Methodist\r\nChurch); and Eglise Méthodiste Française (De Lisle Street).\r\n\r\nIn giving the above list of churches it has not been thought\r\nnecessary to pursue the later history of their separate cessions,\r\nor off-shoots from the parent churches. It is sufficient to note\r\nthat on August 29, 1883, at Belleville, Ontario, the Methodist\r\nChurch of Canada, the Methodist Episcopal Church in Canada, the\r\nProtestant Methodist Church in Canada and the Bible Christian\r\nchurch of Canada, united and became the Methodist Church of\r\nCanada.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        BAPTIST CHURCHES\r\n\r\nAs early as 1820,[1] a number of Baptists in the city met in the\r\nparlour of the residence of Mr. Ebenezer Muir “for the worship of\r\nGod and mutual edification” each Lord’s day for ten consecutive\r\nyears. In 1830, they invited the Rev. John Gilmour of Aberdeen,\r\nScotland, to come to Canada and lead the little flock into larger\r\nfields.\r\n\r\nOn the 12th day of September of the same year, two days after\r\nlanding, Mr. Gilmour, missionary of God, preached his first\r\nsermon to his new charge in this new land in what was then known\r\nas the Bruce Schoolroom on McGill Street.\r\n\r\nThis little band opened their new chapel, situated on St. Helen\r\nStreet and completed at the cost of £935-0-1 of which £572-10-9\r\nwere paid before its opening, leaving a debt of £362-9-4 due to\r\ntwo of their own members, John Fry and Ebenezer Muir, in equal\r\nparts of £181-4-8 each. On the 13th day of November, 1831, the\r\nFirst Baptist Church was regularly organized in this building\r\nwith twenty-five constituent members. A marble tablet placed on\r\nthe wall of Gault Bros’ wholesale establishment on St. Helen\r\nStreet bears the following inscription:--\r\n\r\n                           Here Stood\r\n              The First Baptist Chapel of Montreal,\r\n                              1831.\r\n                 The Rev. John Gilmour, Pastor.\r\n                        Abandoned, 1860.\r\n\r\nImmediately underneath this tablet there is another which\r\nillustrates the spirit of Christian enterprise and helpfulness\r\nthat characterized this mother church in her early days, as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n                           This Tablet\r\n        Commemorates the Organization on this Site of the\r\n             First Young Men’s Christian Association\r\n                   on the American Continent.\r\n                         November, 1851,\r\n       Erected on the Occasion of the Jubilee Celebration,\r\n                          June 8, 1901.\r\n\r\nIt may not be very widely known that the first Young Men’s\r\nChristian Association on this continent was organized by a member\r\nof the First Baptist Church, Mr. T.J. Claxton, in the First\r\nBaptist Church and especially for the young men who were members\r\nof this church and their Christian associates in the city.\r\n\r\nThe period from Mr. Gilmour’s resignation in 1835 to the building\r\nof the Beaver Hall Hill Chapel, was one of trial and testing\r\nbut finally of establishment and triumph. The following are the\r\nnames of the pastors who served the church during this time,\r\nwith the dates on which they took charge:--Rev. Newton Bosworth,\r\nSeptember 29, 1835; Rev. John Hatch Waldon, September 19, 1837;\r\nRev. Beniah Hoe, September 18, 1839; Rev. John Girdwood, June\r\n21, 1841; Rev. Thomas Spalding, April 19, 1851; Rev. Phaucellus\r\nChurch, January 5, 1853; Rev. James Lillie, D.D., November 29,\r\n1853; Rev. J.N. Williams, April 20, 1856; Rev. John Goadby, D.D.,\r\nMay 1, 1859--nine pastors in twenty-six years, or an average of a\r\nlittle less than three years each, indicating an unsettled period\r\nin the history of the church, yet one that laid solid foundation\r\nfor future work.\r\n\r\nWith the advent of Doctor Goadby, May 1, 1859, the church entered\r\nupon a second stage or epoch in her history which we can properly\r\ndesignate the growing and multiplying period.\r\n\r\nThe church, under the leadership of Doctor Goadby, with a\r\nmembership of 160, decided to build a house of worship in a\r\nmore residential and convenient location than St. Helen Street\r\nwas. With this end in view a site was secured at the corner of\r\nBeaver Hall Hill and Lagauchetiere Street on which a beautiful\r\nand up-to-date church home, with excellent equipment for\r\nSunday-school work and other departments of Christian activity,\r\nwas erected at the cost of $25,000. This was opened in January,\r\n1862, and sold in 1878 to the Reformed Episcopal Church. On\r\nthe twenty-seventh day of March, 1863, the Rev. John Alexander\r\naccepted the pastorate of this church. During his incumbency\r\nthe church entered upon a period of uninterrupted prosperity;\r\nconstant accessions were made to its membership.\r\n\r\nIn 1864 a mission was started in the East end of the city in\r\nthe lecture room of the German Lutheran Church on St. Dominique\r\nStreet, with a Sunday-school of twenty-eight scholars and eight\r\nteachers. Shortly after the starting of this school a Thursday\r\nevening prayer meeting and a Sunday evening service were\r\ncommenced. These, after the lapse of some time, outgrew their\r\naccommodation and in 1868 Mr. T.J. Claxton and other members of\r\nthe church erected a commodious building on the corner of St.\r\nCatherine and St. Justin streets, afterwards known as Russell\r\nHall, for the accommodation of this mission. This building was\r\ncalled Russell Hall in honor of Major General Russell of the\r\nBritish Army, a loyal Baptist, who at the time resided in this\r\ncity and who in every possible way supported the work of this\r\nmission.\r\n\r\nRussell Hall Sunday-school, under the leadership of Mr. T.J.\r\nClaxton, was for some years, from the numerical standpoint at\r\nleast, one of the most successful in connection with the Baptist\r\ndenomination, the enrollment reaching 600 and the average\r\nattendance 500. On September 3, 1869, through the advice of a\r\nlarge council called for the purpose, this mission was organized\r\ninto a regular Baptist church of which Rev. Robert Cade, ordained\r\nby the same council, was chosen pastor.\r\n\r\nIn 1875 building on St. Catherine Street, at present occupied by\r\nthe First Baptist Church, was erected as the house of worship\r\nfor the St. Catherine Street Church, at the cost of about\r\n$60,000, in which they continued to worship in their separate\r\ncapacity for three years. During the period between 1869 and\r\n1878 the following were the pastors:--Rev. Robert Cade, 1869-70;\r\nRev. J. Denovan, afterwards Doctor Denovan, 1870-77; Rev. J.L.\r\nCampbell, now Doctor Campbell of the First Church, Cambridge,\r\nMassachusetts, 1877-78; during his pastorate the union between\r\nthe St. Catherine Street and First Churches was consummated.\r\n\r\nGoing back now to the point, in 1864, at which we diverged from\r\nthe history of the First Baptist Church, in tracing the story of\r\nRussell Hall Mission and St. Catherine Street Church, we find\r\nthat after the lapse of about two years, in 1866, another mission\r\nwas started at Point St. Charles which shortly afterwards was\r\norganized into an independent church that gave great promise of\r\nusefulness in that interesting community, with Rev. Thomas Gale\r\nas its pastor. Mr. T.J. Claxton of the First Church erected a\r\nbuilding for the accommodation of the Point St. Charles interest.\r\nWe find, however, that this church disbanded, the cause for\r\nwhich, owing to lack of information, we are unable to state nor\r\nare we able to say what disposition was made of the building nor\r\nwith what church did the remnant of the membership unite.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1875 eighty-five members withdrew from the First\r\nChurch in order to organize the Olivet Baptist Church. In after\r\nyears many other members withdrew and united with this church.\r\nWhile the First Church and its affiliated institutions suffered\r\ngreatly by this movement yet the after history of both the First\r\nand Olivet Churches clearly shows that no single Baptist church\r\ncould, in the City of Montreal, be as strong and influential as\r\nthe two have been and are now.\r\n\r\nIn 1878 the First Baptist Church worshipping in the house of\r\nBeaver Hall Hill and the St. Catherine Street Church worshipping\r\nin the building on the corner of St. Catherine and City\r\nCouncillor streets united, this united body to be known as the\r\nFirst Baptist Church, making the house on St. Catherine Street,\r\nin which they now worship, their church home. The house on Beaver\r\nHall Hill was at that time sold to the Reformed Episcopal church\r\nfor the sum of $25,000. The Rev. J.L. Campbell, pastor of the St.\r\nCatherine Street Church, retiring, the Rev. A.H. Munroe, pastor\r\nof the First Church continued to shepherd the united flock.\r\n\r\nDuring this interesting section of the growing and multiplying\r\nperiod of the church’s history, lying between the erection of the\r\nBeaver Hall Hill house of worship and the union of the First and\r\nSt. Catherine Street Churches, the following were the pastors of\r\nthe First Church:--Rev. John Goadby, D.D., May 1, 1859; Rev. John\r\nAlexander, March 27, 1863; Rev. William Cheetham, 1870; Rev. A.H.\r\nMunroe, 1876.\r\n\r\nBetween the years 1881 and 1886 two missions were started by\r\nindividual members of the church, one at Cote St. Louis and the\r\nother at St. Louis de Mile End, both of which continued for some\r\ntime and gave promise of considerable success. Owing, however, to\r\nthe lack of helpers, the former was by the discouraged workers\r\nhanded over to Canon Evans of the Anglican Church who had a\r\nmission in that neighborhood, and so has become the nucleus\r\nof that which is now All Saints’ Church; and the latter was\r\nclosed because the workers united with the band that withdrew to\r\norganize Grace Baptist Church.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1888 the Gain Street Church was started as another\r\nmission and Sunday-school in the East End of the city to which in\r\n1897 a number of members were dismissed to organize it into an\r\nindependent church.\r\n\r\nIn 1890, during the months of March and April, thirty-four\r\nmembers of the First Baptist Church were dismissed in order\r\nto organize with the St. Louis de Mile End workers, the Grace\r\nBaptist Church, now known as the Westmount Baptist Church. In\r\n1902 the First Church assumed charge of the North Baptist Mission\r\non St. Urbain Street and Duluth Avenue. About this time another\r\nmission was started on Berri Street, not under the auspices\r\nof this church, but successfully carried on by one of its\r\ndeacons--Mr. John Ede, who had associated with him a number of\r\nthe members of this church and other workers.\r\n\r\nMore recently the North Mission property was sold to the\r\nProtestant school commissioners. On the completion of the\r\nTemple Baptist Church (corner of Park and Laurier avenues) the\r\nBerri Street Mission lapsed and its workers returned to the\r\nFirst Baptist Church or to the Temple Church, the Rev. Mr. Ede\r\nafterwards being called to the Tabernacle Church. The latest\r\nchurch added is the Verdun Baptist Church on Rockland Avenue.\r\nMention must be made of the French Baptist Church L’Oratoire at\r\n14 Mance Street, above Sherbrooke Street.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      CONGREGATIONAL CHURCH\r\n\r\nOrganized Canadian Congregationalism began in Montreal in 1829\r\nwhen the Canada Education and Home Missionary Society was founded\r\nin Montreal with Mr. Henry Wilkes, then a young man in business,\r\nas its first secretary. This society was designed to support\r\npioneer Presbyterian, Baptist or Congregational ministers. There\r\nhad been, however, previous sporadic and unorganized attempts\r\nat church establishment in upper Canada. One such was that\r\nfounded in 1817 by a Congregational minister, the Rev. Joseph\r\nSilcox, bearing the extraordinary title of “The Congregational\r\nPresbyterian Prince of Peace Society.” Mr. Wilkes went to\r\nScotland shortly after the formation of the Montreal society\r\nand while a church student in Glasgow induced some ministers,\r\namong them the Rev. Richard Miles, to come to Canada. The Rev.\r\nRichard Miles came to Montreal in 1831, while Rev. Adam Lillie\r\nwent to Brantford in 1833. The visit of the Reverend Doctors Reed\r\nand Matheson, delegates from England to the American churches\r\nin 1834, who also made a trip through Canada, led the foreign\r\nmissionary society to send out some missionaries here, and in\r\n1836, under Mr. Wilkes’ leadership, the Colonial Missonary\r\nSociety, still the foster mother of Canadian Congregationalism,\r\nwas organized in Montreal. The Rev. Mr. Wilkes became the agent\r\nin Montreal and the Rev. Mr. Roaf in Toronto.\r\n\r\nThe first Congregational Church was opened for service on St.\r\nMaurice Street on the second Sabbath of February, 1833. This\r\nwas sold and in 1846 Zion Church was erected. The third church\r\ndates to 1868 and was erected at the corner of Amherst and Craig\r\nstreets. Other churches of a later date are Calvary Church (302\r\nGuy Street), Emanuel Church (Drummond Street, near Sherbrooke\r\nStreet, West), Zion Congregational Church, Point St. Charles (185\r\nCongregation Street), Bethlehem Congregational Church, corner of\r\nWestern Avenue and Clark Avenue.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            UNITARIAN\r\n\r\nThe history of the Unitarian movement in Montreal dates from the\r\nyear 1832, when on the 29th of July the Rev. David Hughes of\r\nEngland preached in the Union School Room at the corner of St.\r\nSacrament and St. Nicholas streets the first Unitarian sermon\r\never delivered, it is believed, anywhere in Canada. This was the\r\nyear in which Montreal was devastated by the Asiatic cholera,\r\n1,900 persons dying in four months, out of a population of\r\nlittle more than thirty thousand. Mr. Hughes was one of these\r\nvictims of the plague, but the work which he had inaugurated\r\nsurvived him. A small band of Unitarian believers secured a place\r\nto hold services in a building which was known on account of its\r\nlocation as St. Joseph Street Chapel. Here the Rev. Mr. Angier,\r\nan American minister, took charge of the services, and a Sunday\r\nSchool was inaugurated by Mr. Benjamin Workman. A movement was\r\nbegun by the infant society to acquire land, and erect a church,\r\nbut the times were unpropitious. A return of the cholera in 1834,\r\ntogether with the subsequent depression of business and the\r\npolitical disturbances which culminated in the Riel Rebellion\r\nof 1837, caused so much discouragement that interest flagged,\r\nand for a while even the regular services were discontinued.\r\nOccasional meetings were, however, held until, in 1841, the\r\nmovement was definitely renewed under the inspiration chiefly of\r\na few devoted women, prominent among whom were Mrs. Cushing and\r\nMrs. Hedge, whose conviction that the time had come for a new\r\nand more vigorous Unitarian propaganda was shared by a group of\r\nmen whose names have been synonymous with good citizenship and\r\nphilanthropy in Montreal during more than one generation. Mr.\r\nJohn Frothingham, Mr. Benjamin Workman, Mr. Luther Holton, Mr.\r\nWilliam Molson, and Doctor Cushing, were actively interested in\r\nthe formation of the second Unitarian congregation of Montreal,\r\nand their efforts were stimulated by the eloquent preaching of\r\nan English minister, the Rev. Mr. Giles, who for several months\r\nconducted services in a small building situated at the corner\r\nof Fortification Lane and Haymarket Square. Subsequently an\r\ninvitation was extended by this small company of worshippers to\r\nthe Rev. John Cordner, of Belfast, Ireland, to become their first\r\nsettled pastor. Mr. Cordner, who preached his first sermon in\r\nMontreal in November, 1843, had been ordained by the Remonstrant\r\nSynod of Ulster, and his congregation remained for several years\r\nin official relation with the Irish Synod. In 1858 this alliance\r\nwas dissolved, and the Montreal Church united in fellowship with\r\nits nearest neighbor, the American Unitarian Association, having\r\nheadquarters in Boston, Massachusetts. During its early years\r\nof struggle financial aid, as well as friendly interest and the\r\nservice of visiting ministers, had been given by this Association\r\nto the Montreal congregation, and it was with their assistance\r\nthat, in 1844, a piece of land was purchased and a church\r\nbuilding erected on Beaver Hall Hill on a site once occupied by\r\nthe old Frobisher mansion, historically connected with the early\r\ndevelopment of the fur-trade in Canada, and with the pioneer days\r\nof the North West Company. In the following year the Unitarian\r\ncongregation received legal status by Act of Parliament, and its\r\nministers were authorized to keep record of civil acts required\r\nof all settled pastors under the laws of the Province. By 1857\r\nthe congregation had outgrown its first building, and a new\r\nplace of worship was erected which, with its simple dignified\r\narchitecture, and beautiful spire, remained for fifty years a\r\nwell-known landmark of the city, under the name at this time\r\nadopted, the Church of the Messiah.\r\n\r\nIn 1869 this building was seriously damaged by fire, and during\r\nthe time when it was undergoing repairs its congregation\r\nworshiped in the hall of the St. Patrick’s Association in\r\nresponse to the generous invitation of the Rev. Father Dowd.\r\n\r\nTowards the end of his long pastorate of thirty-six years Doctor\r\nCordner was assisted, first by the Rev. Edward Hayward for a\r\nperiod of one year, and afterwards, by the Rev. J.B. Green,\r\nduring three years. In 1879 when Doctor Cordner’s advancing years\r\nmade it desirable for him to retire from the active duties of\r\nthe ministry he was succeeded by the Rev. William S. Barnes, of\r\nBoston.\r\n\r\nLike his predecessor Mr. Barnes enjoyed a long pastorate, serving\r\nhis congregation faithfully for thirty years. Of each of these\r\nministers it may truly be said that he gained a unique place in\r\nthe affection of his congregation, combined with one of honor\r\nand respect from the community at large. Each was distinguished\r\nby a life of constant devotion to the service of his ideals, and\r\nthe duties of his pastorate, by unusual intellectual gifts, and\r\nby great pulpit eloquence. The University of McGill recognized\r\nthe ability and public services of both ministers by awarding to\r\nthem the degree of LL. D. The story of the growth and unification\r\nof the Church of the Messiah is largely the story of the devoted\r\nlives of the two ministers who occupied its pulpit for a combined\r\nperiod of nearly seventy years.\r\n\r\nIn 1905 the congregation decided that, owing to the movement\r\nof the population uptown, and away from the old-time centers,\r\nthe situation of its place of worship had become inconveniently\r\nremote, and the property was therefore sold, and a new church\r\nbuilding erected at the corner of Sherbrooke West and Simpson\r\nstreets. The new building, considered to be architecturally one\r\nof the most successful erections of the city, owes much of its\r\nharmony of design and execution to the artistic taste and culture\r\nof Dr. Barnes, who felt its erection to be the culmination of his\r\nlife-work.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        HEBREW SYNAGOGUES\r\n\r\nJewish settlers arrived in Canada towards the close of the period\r\nof French rule. Among the officers and soldiers who fought in the\r\narmies of Amherst and Wolfe were a number of men of the Hebrew\r\nrace who did their modest share towards assisting in the conquest\r\nof the country and making it a part of the British Empire. When\r\nthey became sufficiently numerous to establish their first\r\nJewish congregation in Montreal, Canada, in 1768, they followed\r\nthe ritual of the Spanish and Portuguese or Sephardic Jews.\r\nThis congregation took the name of the Spanish and Portuguese\r\nJews, “Shearith Israel,” and the Congregation has continued ever\r\nsince in existence, being one of the most ancient of the Jewish\r\ncongregations in America. It at present worships on Stanley\r\nStreet above St. Catherine. The first place of worship was in a\r\nroom or hall on St. James Street, but in 1777 there was built\r\nthe first regular synagogue building on a lot of land belonging\r\nto David David, son of Lazarus David, the first Jewish settler\r\nin this city. The building was described as a low walled edifice\r\nof stone with a red roof and high white-washed wall enclosing\r\nit. It stood on Notre Dame Street at the junction of St. James\r\nStreet adjoining the present Court House and had an entrance on\r\neither side. Shortly after the erection of this synagogue the\r\nCongregation bought its first lot of land for a cemetery on St.\r\nJanvier Street near what is now known as Dominion Square.\r\n\r\nThe first synagogue built near the Court House had to be\r\nabandoned on account of the land on which it was built reverting\r\nto the David family after the death of David David, and after\r\nworshipping temporarily at the south-west corner of St. Helen and\r\nRecollet streets, the second synagogue building of the Spanish\r\nand Portuguese Congregation was erected on Chenneville Street in\r\n1835 and completed in 1838. It was a small but dignified stone\r\nbuilding with a Doric portico and quasi-Egyptian interior. The\r\nwork was mainly carried out under the direction of Moses J. Hays,\r\na son of Andrew Hays, one of the earliest Jewish colonists, and\r\nhe was at that time a trustee of the Congregation.\r\n\r\nWhen the Spanish and Portuguese Synagogue was founded its first\r\nrabbi was the Rev. Jacob Raphael Cohen, who came to Montreal in\r\n1778, and held office for a number of years. He was succeeded by\r\nM. Levy, and after him came Isaac Valentine. Rev. David Piza was\r\nappointed minister of the Congregation in 1840 and held office\r\nfor six years, when he returned to London and became one of the\r\nministers of the Sephardic congregation there.\r\n\r\nIn 1846 the Rev. Abraham de Sola, LL. D., of London, England,\r\nwas elected rabbi and arrived in Canada early in the following\r\nyear. Dr. Abraham de Sola belonged to a family that had long\r\nbeen prominent in the annals of the Jewish people in Spain and\r\nafterwards in Holland and in England. His mother was of the\r\nequally distinguished Meldola family. For over thirty-five years\r\nhe remained the spiritual chief of the Sephardic Jews in this\r\ncountry. He died in 1882 and was succeeded by his eldest son,\r\nRev. Meldola de Sola.\r\n\r\nIn 1890 the Spanish and Portuguese Jewish Congregation removed to\r\na new synagogue building which they had erected on Stanley Street\r\nabove St. Catherine. The corner stone had been laid three years\r\npreviously. Its architectural features are interesting as being a\r\nconscientious attempt to carry out a pseudo Judeo-Egyptian style\r\nwith considerable success. Its design was due to Mr. Clarence I.\r\nde Sola, one of the sons of Dr. Abraham de Sola, who directed\r\nits erection and who had much to do with the carrying out of the\r\nundertaking.\r\n\r\nIn the same year the Spanish and Portuguese Jews obtained a new\r\nact of incorporation from the Provincial Parliament, its earlier\r\nact of incorporation proving now inadequate to the needs of the\r\ngrowing body.\r\n\r\nUp to the year 1846 the Spanish and Portuguese Congregation,\r\n“Shearith Israel” had remained the only Jewish Congregation in\r\nMontreal, but during that year a number of recently arrived\r\nGerman and Polish Jews established a second synagogue, and in\r\nconsequence of this a joint act of Parliament had been secured\r\nfor the two congregations. The second congregation, however,\r\nexisted only for a very short time, as its members were very\r\nfew in number so that they disbanded and joined the original\r\nSpanish and Portuguese Congregation. In 1857-58, however, a\r\nnumber of new arrivals of Jews from Poland, availing themselves\r\nof the act of incorporation that had been obtained by their\r\npredecessors, organized in 1858, what is now known as the\r\nCongregation of German and Polish Jews, “Shaar Hashamoyim.” They\r\ngathered regularly for worship about 1860 and erected their\r\nfirst synagogue on St. Constant Street, now known as Cadieux\r\nStreet. Among the founders of the congregation were A. Hoffmann,\r\nM.A. Olandorff, Edward Hymes and Lewis Anthony and were shortly\r\nafterwards joined by David Moss, Edward Moss, Lawrence Moss and\r\nSolomon Silvermann. The members of the Moss family were long\r\namong the most prominent of the leaders in this synagogue and\r\nwere active here in Jewish communal affairs for two generations.\r\nAmong those of the younger generation of this family were Samuel\r\nD. Moss, Hyman D. Moss and John Moss, who all in turn held office\r\nin “Shaar Hashamoyim.” Among others who occupied the office\r\nof president of this congregation were Lyon Silverman, Moses\r\nVineberg and D.A. Ansell. In 1887 the congregation built a new\r\nsynagogue in McGill College Avenue. During recent years it has\r\ngrown immensely in membership. This has been notably the case\r\nunder the administration of its late president, Mr. Lazarus\r\nCohen, as well as during the administration of his son, Mr. Lyon\r\nCohen, both of whom have been very active and capable workers\r\nin the Jewish community of to-day. So well, indeed, have these\r\nmen and their associates managed the affairs of the Congregation\r\nthat they have already acquired land near Atwater Avenue and\r\nSt. Luke Street to put up a much larger synagogue to meet the\r\ndemands of its ever-growing membership. The first regular rabbi\r\nof Congregation “Shaar Hashamoyim” was the Rev. Mr. Foss and\r\namong his successors were the Rev. I.M. Cohen, Rev. E.M. Myers,\r\nRev. L. Friedlander, Rev. Isador Myers and the Rev. B. Kaplan.\r\nThe present incumbent of the office is the Rev. Dr. Hermann\r\nAbramowitz.\r\n\r\nUp to the year 1881 the Jewish population of Montreal was not\r\nlarge, and the membership of the two congregations which then\r\nexisted was, in consequence, limited; but the terrible outbreak\r\nof persecution of Jews in Russia in 1881 and the recurrence of\r\nthese outbreaks periodically in the following decades resulted\r\nin immense numbers of Jews immigrating from Russia to Canada and\r\nother countries. As a result the Jewish population of Montreal\r\nincreased by tens of thousands in a very short time, and it is\r\nestimated that to-day there are in this city alone fully 60,000\r\nJews. One of the results was the formation of a large number\r\nof new Jewish congregations and the erection of quite a number\r\nof commodious synagogues. Among these are the Congregation of\r\n“B’Nai Jacob,” which erected a new building on the site of the\r\nold one in Cadieux Street. Among its founders were L. Aaronson\r\nand L. Lazarus. The Roumanian Jews formed the Congregation “Beth\r\nDavid,” and purchased the Chenneville Street building from its\r\nformer occupants after they had altered it considerably. Shortly\r\nafterwards the Congregation “Chevra Kadisha” was formed, and they\r\nerected their present handsome building on St. Urbain Street,\r\nwhile the Austrian Jews erected a large synagogue on Milton\r\nStreet. The building of new synagogues has continued apace,\r\nand the formation of new congregations of Hebrews is a common\r\noccurrence.\r\n\r\nAll the congregations referred to above follow the customs of\r\ntraditional or orthodox Judaism, but in 1882 a small number of\r\ngentlemen who favored the principles of American Reform Judaism\r\nmet in the old Lindsay Building on St. Catherine Street to form\r\na “Reform” congregation, and thus was founded what is now known\r\nas Congregation Temple Emanuel. They held their first services in\r\nthe autumn of 1882 and obtained an act of incorporation in March,\r\n1883. Among the founders of this congregation were B.A. Boas, B.\r\nKortosk, Leopold Isaacs, L. Abrahams, E. Lichtenhein, S. Fishel,\r\nand A. Goldstein. They were soon afterwards joined by Samuel\r\nDavis, who for a number of years held office as president and who\r\nwas a popular member of the reform community. They first rented\r\na building but afterwards erected a temple on Stanley Street,\r\nin the rear of the Windsor Hotel. On September 17, 1911, they\r\ndedicated their new temple building on Sherbrooke Street, West,\r\nnear Westmount. This Congregation is up to the present the only\r\none following the Reform ritual in Canada, and although they form\r\nbut a small minority of the total community, they have adhered to\r\ntheir views in a typical manner. Their present president is Mr.\r\nMaxwell Goldstein, K.C. Their first minister was the Rev. Samuel\r\nMarks, who was followed among others by the Rev. H. Veld, and\r\nRev. Isaac Landman. Their present rabbi is the Rev. Nathan Gordon.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       THE SALVATION ARMY\r\n\r\nThe religious work of the Salvation Army began in Montreal on the\r\n13th of November, 1884, with the following as the first corps\r\nof officers: Commissioner T.B. Combs, territorial commander,\r\nin charge of the work throughout Canada; Staff Commander\r\nMadden, divisional commander; Captain and Mrs. “Happy Bill”\r\nCooper, corps officers; assisted by Lieutenant Eva Lewis. It\r\nmet initial difficulties, principally in the injunction that\r\nforbade the holding of meetings unless they kept moving, which\r\nwas circumvented by moving around in a circle at the same spot, a\r\nnecessity which was finally allowed to drop.\r\n\r\nThe first corps held its meetings for the first two years in\r\nWebber’s Hall, which stood on the site of the present Canadian\r\nNorthern Steamship Company’s building on Dollard Lane and St.\r\nJames Street. Next the Mechanic’s Hall, on St. James and St.\r\nPeter streets was used as a meeting place for six months. The\r\nnext location was the basement of Leggett’s boot and shoe factory\r\nat the corner of Craig and Victoria streets, where the present\r\nGreenshield’s building stands, until the St. Alexander Street\r\nbuilding was erected.\r\n\r\nThis was the citadel and training home for officers and the main\r\ncorps of the army. The fine structure on University Street, the\r\ndivisional headquarters, was erected in 1903, and the building\r\non St. Alexander Street was altered entirely to become the\r\npresent “Metropole” for social relief work. The University Street\r\nbuilding, in addition to serving as the divisional headquarters\r\nof the Army also houses the finance and immigration departments\r\nand is the home of Corps No. 1, and includes the Young Women’s\r\nLodge.\r\n\r\nFollowing the opening of the work by Corps No. 1, Corps No. 2 was\r\norganized in Point St. Charles on March 15, 1885.\r\n\r\nCorps No. 3, the French Corps, opened its work on the 9th of\r\nDecember, 1887, in a little store on St. Lawrence Main and St.\r\nViateur streets. French-speaking officers, brought over from\r\nParis, organized the work and still continue in charge of its\r\naffairs. This little home was at first the scene of much turmoil,\r\nmany serious fights occurring in which chairs and other weapons\r\nwere freely used, but out of this grew, with the passing of the\r\nyears, the present strong, harmonious body.\r\n\r\nOn the 30th of June, 1890, Corps No. 4 was formed in the East\r\nEnd, and on April 5, 1905, Corps No. 5 on St. Alexander Street,\r\nwhich is the Men’s Social Corps. Corps No. 6, the most recent to\r\nbe organized, began its work on June 25, 1914, in Verdun.\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to account fully for the origin of other\r\nreligious bodies in the city. The German Lutherans established\r\ntheir church in 1858 on St. Dominique Street, immediately in the\r\nrear of St. Lawrence market. It is now occupied by the “Temple\r\nof Labour.” The Swedenborgians were established on Dorchester\r\nStreet, corner of Hanover, in 1862. The Assembly of Christians,\r\nat the corner of St. George Street and Fortification Lane, about\r\nthe same period. The French Evangelical Church, on Craig Street,\r\nwas established in 1864. Lovell’s directory of today gives the\r\nlocation of the following churches: Christian Science--First\r\nChurch of Christ Scientist--41 and 43 Closse Street, Western\r\nSquare: New Jerusalem Church, corner of Dorchester West and\r\nHanover Street; Lutheran Churches--St. John’s Church (German\r\nLutheran), corner of Mance and Prince Arthur Street; Church\r\nof the Redeemer (Evangelical Lutheran), 365 Mountain Street;\r\nCatholic Apostolic Church, 314 St. Catherine Street, West; Church\r\nof Christ (Disciples), 109 Fairmount, corner of Mance Street;\r\nSeventh Day Adventist Church, corner of Villeneuve, West, and\r\nHutchison streets; Montreal Chinese Mission (Protestant), 336\r\nLagauchitiere Street, West; Undenominational Mission (City),\r\n294-296 Cadieux Street; Desrivières Street Mission; Italian\r\nMethodist Mission, corner of Dorchester Street, West, and St.\r\nUrbain.

NOTE:\r\n    THE JESUITS’ ESTATES.\r\n\r\n\r\nUnder the English Rule the system of primary education carried on\r\nby the Sulpicians for boys and Marguerite Bourgeoys’ congregation\r\nfor girls was continued as before the session. That for boys\r\nbegan when the Sulpician Souart, the first schoolmaster of\r\nMontreal, commenced his school teaching about 1669, after he had\r\nfinished the first term as superior of the seminary.\r\n\r\nThe earliest new movement for boys after the English possession\r\nwas made as follows:\r\n\r\nIn 1773 the stables and poultry house of the old Château de\r\nVaudreuil became a school for little boys for elementary\r\neducation, and from this date the château became known as the\r\nCollège de St. Raphael, the successor of the Pétit Seminaire\r\nestablished in 1767 by M. Curatteau in his presbytery at Longue\r\nPointe.\r\n\r\nIn 1776 the Collège de St. Raphael was formerly inaugurated for\r\nthe purpose of higher education, but it continued its elementary\r\nclasses or petites écoles.\r\n\r\nOn October 11, 1790, in answer to a request of Lord Dorchester\r\nof the sixth of the same month, a catalogue of the professors of\r\nthe College of Montreal for 1790 was sent with some remarks on\r\nthe college and on the schools. The latter are as follows: “The\r\nschools which the ecclesiastics of the Seminary of Montreal keep\r\nare nearly as old as the establishment of the town. They teach\r\nonly reading and writing in Latin and in French. The Seminary\r\nundertakes all the expense, furnishes the wood and the books,\r\npays the masters’ board and lodges them. These schools are\r\ndivided into ‘grandes’ and ‘petites.’ The petites écoles are for\r\nchildren who are only beginning to learn to read. The grandes\r\nécoles are for those who commence already to know how to read and\r\nwho are learning to write. The parents who are able, pay five\r\nshillings a year for each scholar. The poor pay nothing at all.”\r\n\r\nThe first English schoolmaster in Montreal would seem to\r\nbe a John Pullman, who came from New York in 1773 by the\r\nrecommendation of the Rev. Dr. Ogilvie to try to establish a\r\nschool in Montreal in consequence of an application to him from\r\ngentlemen of that city. He worked under a committee. This above\r\ninformation is told in the memorial of 1779, in which he applied\r\nfor a license of Protestant schoolmaster similar to the position\r\nthat Tanswell then possessed in Quebec. His recommendation\r\nwas signed by the leading men of Montreal. But his scholars\r\ndwindling through competition, doubtless, his poverty forced him\r\nto apply, in 1782, for any small employment as a clerk and for\r\na subscription to a work he had prepared, the short title of\r\nwhich was “Cash Clerks’ Assistant.” Finlay Fisher opened a school\r\nabout 1778 which he said was well attended and flourishing. The\r\nRev. Mr. John Stuart opened an academy for youth in Montreal in\r\n1781. Mr. Stuart was born in the province of Virginia in 1736 or\r\n1740, was ordained in England, returning in 1770 to Philadelphia,\r\nwhence he went as a missionary to the Mohawk valley. On the\r\noutbreak of the American revolution he had been made a prisoner\r\nfor his loyalty. He seems to have escaped and made his way to\r\nMontreal. He prepared his advertisement and sent it to Governor\r\nHaldimand, who offered to give him every encouragement and\r\nappropriated to the undertaking part of the bounty allowed\r\nby government, adding “Your advertisement will be published\r\ntomorrow, but I directed the words ‘principally intended for the\r\nchildren of Protestants’ to be left out as it is a distinction\r\nwhich could not fail to create jealousies at all times improper\r\nbut more particularly so at present.” His Excellency desired that\r\nall classes should be received. Mr. Stuart in complying said that\r\nhe had already admitted any persons that offered, Protestants,\r\nCatholics, Jews, etc.\r\n\r\nIt was difficult to get schoolmasters in the early days. Mr.\r\nStuart’s assistant was a Mr. Christie. He was incapable of\r\nteaching even the lowest branches of arithmetic and language.\r\nMr. Stuart on November 27, 1782, reported in all simplicity\r\nto Haldimand: “I could have dispensed with his ignorance of\r\nthe English language and faulty accent, but when I found him\r\nunacquainted with the rules of common arithmetic and often\r\nobliged to apply to me (in presence of the pupils) for the\r\nsolution of the most simple question, I could no longer doubt\r\nof his inefficiency.” A new assistant was engaged and shortly\r\nafterward Christie left the province. Finlay Fisher in 1783 in\r\nhis memorial applied for Christie’s salary, £25 a year, to be\r\nadded to his own; he did not receive it, however, till May 1,\r\n1786, when it came due for the first time for the preceding six\r\nmonths. Mr. Stuart’s last salary at Montreal was for the six\r\nmonths between November 1, 1785, to April 30, 1786. He then went\r\nto Kingston on which his gaze had been fixed for some time. He\r\nbecame the first Anglican clergyman there. In 1789 he established\r\na classical school there, the first school of the kind in Upper\r\nCanada.\r\n\r\nAn early report issued in England before 1790 by the “Society for\r\nthe Propagation,” speaking of the early struggles, mentions that\r\n“there is not a single Protestant church in the whole province.\r\n* * * There are two schools, to each of which a salary of £100\r\na year is allotted by the government, the one at Quebec and the\r\nother at Montreal. The schoolmaster’s name at Quebec is Tanswell.\r\nThe Rev. Mr. Stuart had the school at Montreal for a short time\r\n(after his flight from Fort Hunter, where he was a missionary)\r\nuntil, about two years ago, the government thought proper to take\r\nhalf his salary away and divide it between a Mr. Fisher and Mr.\r\nChristie, both Presbyterians. * * * But besides the division of\r\nthe salary there is neither a schoolhouse nor land appropriated\r\nnor trustees appointed, nor any regularities made respecting the\r\napplication of the £100 salary. The inhabitants are opulent and\r\ngenerous and only want a proper person to place and establish\r\na seminary. In that case the income cannot fail of being\r\nconsiderable. The prices for tuition have been for Latin, half a\r\nguinea, for English and arithmetic, $2 per month. There is not an\r\nEnglish school in the place.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: STUDIES FROM THE CARTIER MONUMENT: Law]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: STUDIES FROM THE CARTIER MONUMENT: Education]\r\n\r\nIn 1790, however, a memorandum was made of the ecclesiastical and\r\neducational aspects of the country which gives us an insight into\r\nthe growing life of the English colony in Canada and Montreal,\r\noccasioned, no doubt, by the influx of the United Empire\r\nLoyalists migrating into the country:\r\n\r\n\r\n                        PROTESTANT CLERGY\r\n\r\n                   Episcopal or English Church\r\n\r\n                                                             Salaries.\r\n  M. de Lisle, Montreal                                       £ 200\r\n  Tunstall                                                      100\r\n  De Montmolten, Quebec                                         200\r\n  Toosey                                                        200\r\n  Veyssiere, Three Rivers                                       200\r\n  Doty, William Henry                                           100\r\n  Stuart, Kingston                                              100\r\n  Bryan, Cornwall                                                50\r\n  Langhorn, near Kingston (missionary from ye society for\r\n    propagating ye gospel with £50 and from government £100)    150\r\n\r\n                       Church of Scotland\r\n\r\n  Messrs.

For this funds were badly needed.\r\n\r\nIn pursuing the history of the educational movement in which\r\nMontreal shares, notice must be now taken of the Jesuit estates,\r\nfor upon the funds accruing from these, an early movement\r\nstarted to rear the means of an educational system in Canada.\r\nAfter the suppression of the Society of Jesus in 1774 in Canada\r\nthese estates had been promised to Lord Amherst as a recognition\r\nof his services. This met with consistent opposition, and a\r\ncontra-movement arose to secure the estates as a means of rearing\r\nup a public educational system. A petition of November 19, 1787,\r\nwas signed at Quebec by 195 inhabitants transmitting a “case” in\r\nwhich it was claimed that “as Canadians and citizens they had a\r\nright therein by title, and law, the College of Quebec having\r\nbeen founded for their education. It is their patrimony which\r\nthey have cleared and cultivated. Even as subjects they have a\r\nright to public education which exists in every government.” The\r\n“case” insists that the Jesuits were only the rectors, professors\r\nand managers: that the Hundred Associates and others had founded\r\nthe colleges for educational purposes. The petitioners demand\r\nthat the troops then using the college as a barracks should\r\nbe dislodged and pray the government “to restore the antient\r\nprofessors of the college or to name others and regulate the\r\nrecompense due to their talents and attentions.” It is but\r\njust to note that the Jesuits never ceded their claims to the\r\ncomplete possession of their estates, nor recognized a mere\r\ntrusteeship.\r\n\r\nA similar petition to that of 1787 was addressed by the\r\ninhabitants of Montreal in 1793, and again in 1800, praying that\r\non reversion of the Jesuit estates the revenue should be diverted\r\nto the education of youth. Three Rivers similarly protested\r\nagainst the policy of the Amherst grant. At the first legislative\r\nassembly a recommendation was made for the divergence of the\r\nJesuit funds to popular education. Thus Amherst’s patent was\r\nnot signed. The death of Perè Casot, the last surviving Jesuit\r\nof the old régime, occurring in 1801, the governor claimed the\r\nestates for the crown, which hitherto had been administered by\r\nthe Society. A majority in the house preferred that they should\r\nbe devoted to educational purposes and demanded the titles. But\r\nit was not till 1831 that they were finally ceded, with the\r\nexception of the Jesuit College at Quebec which became converted\r\ninto a barracks. Meanwhile the Anglican bishop of the diocese and\r\nother English leaders, especially the merchants, deploring the\r\nlack of educational facilities, agitated for a _general_ school\r\nsystem, one of the arguments being the usefulness this would have\r\nof encouraging the English language through the province. At\r\nthis time three classes of schools were in contemplation: parish\r\nschools (elementary), grammar schools and superior seminaries\r\nor universities, schools on the line of Westminster, Winchester\r\nand Eton. With regard to a university the committee of the\r\nexecutive council thought it premature to formulate any plan, but\r\nrecommended that an appropriation should be made to cover any\r\nplan that might be adopted.\r\n\r\nThe future of education was reported on in answer to the\r\nfollowing questions: “The establishing of schools and seminaries\r\nfor the education of youth from those funds now unemployed\r\nas well in England as in this province and particularly a\r\nrespectable college in this city with able professors and\r\nerecting free schools at convenient distances throughout this\r\nextensive province for the purpose of opening and enlarging the\r\nhuman mind, conciliating the affections of all His Majesty’s\r\nsubjects and having a tendency to render this a happy and\r\nflourishing province.” Observation: “There remains for us to\r\nadvert to a subject which we consider as the surest and best\r\nmeans of obtaining a cheerful and dutiful obedience to the\r\nlaws and government from subjects in general, and that is by\r\nestablishing throughout the province at proper distances public\r\nschools for the education of youth. We hardly know of a single\r\nschool in any country part of the district for teaching boys\r\nand it is to the zeal of the few sisters of the congregation\r\nthat we are indebted for all the little which is taught to\r\ngirls throughout the country. The captains of militia who are\r\nfrequently called upon to enforce law and order are so illiterate\r\nthat not one in three can write or even read. The consequence is\r\nconfusion and disorder and frequent suits and complaints between\r\nthem and the militiamen.” They then suggest that for funds the\r\nestates of the Jesuits, which they understood likely to revert to\r\nthe crown, could be conveniently applied for the purpose; that\r\nalso, owing to the separation of the American states, there might\r\nbe some unappropriated funds in England which could be applied\r\nfor. The report reverts to the former petition of 1785 for a\r\nhouse of assembly, suggesting this as the only way to promote the\r\nwelfare of the province as a British colony. In 1793, therefore,\r\na further recommendation was made to the legislative assembly\r\nwhich presented an address to the governor urging upon the crown\r\nthe propriety of devoting the Jesuit estates for educational\r\npurposes. No answer having been given, another on the same\r\nsubject was presented to the governor in 1800.\r\n\r\nIn reply to this the governor, in a speech to the legislature,\r\nintimated the intention of the government “to set apart a portion\r\nof the crown domain instead for the establishment of a competent\r\nnumber of free schools for the instruction of their children\r\nin the first rudiments of useful learning and in the English\r\ntongue; and also as occasion may require for foundations of a\r\nmore enlarged and comprehensive nature.” In 1801, therefore,\r\nan act entitled “an act for the establishment of free schools\r\nand the advancement of learning in the province” was passed by\r\nthe provincial legislature to give effect to these promises. It\r\nprovided also for “the establishment of a Royal Institution for\r\nthe Advancement of Learning.” To this corporation was entrusted\r\nthe entire management of all schools and institutions of royal\r\nfoundation in the province as well as the administration of all\r\nestates and property appropriated to these schools.\r\n\r\nThis act remained practically a dead letter, since no grants\r\nwere ever made. What rendered the scheme a failure was the\r\nadditional reason of its unpopularity with the majority. Of the\r\neighteen trustees of the Royal Institution, four only were Roman\r\nCatholics; and of the fourteen Protestants, three were prominent\r\nofficials in Upper Canada. The teachers, too, were principally\r\nfrom Britain, unacquainted with the French language and generally\r\nignorant of the habits of the people.\r\n\r\nIn 1818 in order to give practical effect to the act of 1801 all\r\nthe government schools then receiving government aid were placed\r\nunder the Royal Institution. The question of representative\r\ntrusteeship was made more simple and more equitable, but the\r\nProtestant Lord Bishop of Quebec was named principal. This again\r\nkept the Catholics from participating, the movement being still\r\nlooked upon as Protestant and Anglicizing. So that Lord Dalhousie\r\nwrote from Quebec on the 10th of June, 1821, to Lord Bathurst,\r\nasking that His Majesty would sanction the establishment\r\nof a Catholic institution precisely similar to that of the\r\nProtestants for the government of their schools. “The Catholic\r\nreligion in this province,” he said, “is certainly the most sure\r\ndefense yet against our neighbours and every fair encouragement\r\nshould be given to it in promoting education and learning. One\r\ngreat objection complained of is the being subjected to the\r\nsuperintendence of the Royal Institution, of which the Protestant\r\nbishop is president. That objection is natural in a country where\r\nthe Catholic religion prevails as to numbers and is guarded by\r\nministers always watchful and perhaps jealous of the Protestant\r\nchurch.”\r\n\r\nThe Royal Institution was never popular because of its want of\r\nsympathy with the people whom it wished to benefit. It cannot be\r\nsaid to have been a success, owing to the peculiar denominational\r\nconstitution of its charter and the apathy in its own council.\r\nStill it pointed the way to a general scheme of public education\r\nwhich afterwards bore fruit. Its greatest success is in the\r\npresent day McGill University, whose official title is still the\r\n“Royal Institution for the Advancement of Learning.”\r\n\r\nVarious attempts were made by the legislature to introduce a more\r\npopular system of management in the schools. In 1824, on the\r\nelaborate report of a special committee of the province which\r\nrepresented that in many parishes not more than five or six of\r\nthe inhabitants could write; that generally not above one-fourth\r\nof the entire population could read and that not above one-tenth\r\nof the entire population could write, a counterpoise measure\r\nto the royal institution was passed for the Catholics entitled\r\nthe “Fabrique act” by which the Fabriques or corporations of\r\nthe parish churches consisting of the curé and church wardens\r\nas school commissioners, could hold and acquire property, etc.,\r\nto found and carry on elementary schools, one for every one\r\nhundred families. One of the great reasons for the failure of\r\neducational legislation down to 1836 was the want of permanency\r\nabout it all. Another was the jobbery of politicians in a time\r\nof seething turmoil. Arthur Buller, commissioner, appointed by\r\nLord Durham in 1838, reports clearly on this. “In short, the\r\nmoment that they found that their educational provisions could be\r\nturned to political account, from that moment those provisions\r\nwere formed with a view to promote party rather than education.\r\nThis was their essential fault. This, it was, that pervaded and\r\ncontaminated the whole system and paralyzed all good that was\r\notherwise in it.” There were about one thousand, six hundred\r\nschools in Canada and these had to be closed.\r\n\r\nIt is now in place to review the state of education in Montreal\r\nunder the Royal Institution. When finally funds were forthcoming\r\nthey were supplied by an annual vote of the provincial parliament\r\nof £2,000, but under an authority from Lord Bathurst, dated\r\nJanuary 24, 1817, a grant was made from the revenues of the\r\nJesuit estate confined to the grammar schools of Quebec and\r\nMontreal. The latter received £200 a year with £52 a year for\r\nthe rent of the schoolhouse. By the rules of the foundation\r\ntwenty free scholars were to be admitted. At this date there were\r\nfifteen all told who paid for their education as day scholars.\r\nThe terms for instruction in the higher education were £10 a year\r\nand £8 for the lower.\r\n\r\nThere were also two elementary schools at Montreal which received\r\nappropriations from the government, viz., the British and\r\nCanadian schools (£300) and the National free school (£200). With\r\nregard to the schools under the institution a memorandum of Sir\r\nJohn Kempt states that “by a return made in the year 1818 the\r\nnumber of schools in this province was stated to be thirty-seven\r\nattended by only 1,048 scholars and maintained at an expense to\r\nthe public of £1,883 10 strg.”\r\n\r\nIn 1829 he also states the number of schools up to July 1st\r\nas seventy-eight and the number of scholars 3,772. Up to this\r\ndate Catholics had no connection with the institution. In Lord\r\nAylmer’s report of 1832 the schools under the royal institution\r\nof which the names are given as well as those of the teachers and\r\ntheir salaries, number seventy. The schools of Montreal given\r\namong the list of “society or private” institutions receiving\r\noccasional aid from public funds are given thus:\r\n\r\n  Place.             Establishment.

The Royal Grammar school was founded in Montreal\r\nin 1816, with Mr. Alexander Skakel, M.A., who came out from\r\nEngland as head master. A writer in the Montreal Daily Herald of\r\nSaturday, March 15, 1913, writes:\r\n\r\n“This may be said to have been the first ambitious attempt to put\r\nProtestant education in Montreal on a substantial and efficient\r\nfooting. Mr. Skakel came out under, as he was wont to say, the\r\npleasing illusion that the new world would offer him prospects\r\ndenied him in the old. He was disillusionized, for the colony was\r\nnot only young and raw, but the political and social conditions\r\nof the time were anything but congenial, while the emoluments\r\nwere slender, and the life, generally, wholly different to that\r\nto which he had been accustomed. However, Mr. Skakel--whose\r\nportrait hangs in the High School--did not complain, but went\r\nstraight on, developing the school which met, first of all, in\r\nthe old Belmont Park building, and afterwards in the Fraser\r\nbuilding at the corner of Dorchester Street and Union Avenue.”\r\n\r\nMr. Skakel was succeeded by the Rev. John Leeds and the Rev.\r\nGeorge Simpson. The Royal grammar school was merged with the\r\nhigh school shortly after the organization of the latter in\r\n1845. The Lancaster School took its name from Messrs. Lancaster\r\nand Bell, who came out from England, having been instrumental\r\nin establishing popular schools there, and they interested\r\nthemselves in the formation of the British Canadian school. The\r\nearly days of education were those of sacrifice for the teachers,\r\nill paid, with inadequate teaching facilities, both in materials\r\nand buildings, overwork, and for the treasury which had to depend\r\non voluntary gifts and collecting cards. Things are better now,\r\nbut one wonders whether the teaching profession will ever come to\r\nits own.\r\n\r\nThe National School was founded in 1816 under the auspices of\r\nthe Montreal district committee of the Society for Promoting\r\nChristian Knowledge. In 1839 the number of boys was 36 French and\r\n120 English, and of girls 20 French and 84 English.\r\n\r\nThe British and Canadian School Society, which was opened in\r\na building belonging formerly to the Montreal Hospital, was\r\ninstituted on the 21st of September, 1822, to maintain on\r\nan extensive scale a school to promote the education of the\r\nlabouring classes, and secondly, as a model school to train up\r\nteachers under Mr. Lancaster and a committee of gentlemen for\r\nfuture schools to follow the British system. It was meant to be\r\nundenominational. Its early success enabled it to build by funds\r\nfrom voluntary sources and from the provincial government a more\r\ncommodious schoolhouse on Lagauchetière Street, the foundation\r\nbeing laid on the 17th of October, 1826. It was designed to\r\nschool 414 boys and 232 girls. In 1826 the number of attendance\r\nwas:\r\n\r\n                       Boys  Girls\r\n  Roman Catholics       97    38\r\n  Episcopal Church      27     9\r\n  Presbyterian          42    21\r\n  Methodists            30    11\r\n                      ----   ----\r\n                       196    79\r\n      Total, 275.\r\n\r\nThis school lapsed in 1837, the year of the rebellion, which\r\nproved so fatal to education. There were 1,600 schools in the\r\nprovince, teaching 40,000 children, and these had to be closed.\r\nThe Brothers of the Christian Schools made their entry into\r\nMontreal in 1837. Their important work, of which humble seeds\r\nwere now laid, developed greatly under the Union, its story being\r\ntherefore left to a later chapter.\r\n\r\nA summary of the schools of 1839 is presented by Bosworth\r\nin “Hochelaga Depicta.” Besides the “New College” or “pétit\r\nseminaire,” there were “several respectable academies in the\r\ncity, as the Royal Grammar School in Little St. James Street,\r\nconducted by A. Skakel, Esq.; the Rev. Dr. Black’s, adjoining\r\nSt. Paul Church; Rev. J. Ramsay’s, Main Street, St. Lawrence\r\nsuburbs; Messrs. Howden & Taggart’s, Craig Street; Mr. Workman’s,\r\nin Hospital Street; and Mr. Bruce’s, in McGill Street. There are\r\nalso young ladies’ schools of high reputation, as Miss Easton’s,\r\nin Bonaventure Street; Miss Felton’s, in St. Gabriel Street; and\r\nMrs. Fitzgerald’s, in Notre Dame Street. The total number of\r\nschools it would be impossible to assign. A few years since two\r\ngentlemen of the city made personal inquiry throughout the place\r\nwith a view to determining the point. They found fifty-nine of\r\ndifferent classes, but it is probable not only that some were\r\noverlooked, but that the number is greater now than it was then.\r\nThere was also much private tuition in the families of the more\r\nwealthy inhabitants.”\r\n\r\nThe writer probably includes in the fifty-nine or more among\r\nthe unnamed schools those of the Catholics, which were under\r\nthe auspices of the Sulpicians, the teaching orders of the\r\nCongregational Nuns and the Brothers of the Christian Schools,\r\nand those conducted by lay people. A review of the schools for\r\nCatholics up to the Union may be now presented.\r\n\r\nThe early movement under the Sulpicians up to 1790 has already\r\nbeen stated. About 1796, as the city was beginning to expand,\r\nM. Roux, the superior of the seminary, opened a new school for\r\nchildren in the St. Lawrence district under the control of a\r\nlayman. Later he established other schools at Bonsecours, St.\r\nLawrence, St. Antoine, St. Mary (or the Faubourg de Quebec), and\r\nSt. Joseph, all these schools with the exception of the seminary\r\nreceiving children of both sexes. M. Quiblier, succeeding M.\r\nRoux, determined to erect separate schools or boys and girls,\r\nthe latter to be under the direction of the Congregation Nuns.\r\nThese, therefore, opened successively a great number of classes,\r\nthree at the Faubourg, St. Lawrence; six at that of Quebec\r\n(St. Mary’s), two of which were for the Irish; three classes at\r\nSt. Antoine, and three at St. Joseph, and two classes at the\r\nRecollects for the Irish.\r\n\r\nThe Seminary provided the schools, their furniture and upkeep,\r\nand undertook to convey the nuns to and fro morning and evening.\r\nAbout fifteen hundred children were instructed and educated\r\ngratuitously in these schools. In addition the Congregation\r\nmaintained in its own motherhouse, the pensionat, composed of\r\nsix classes; the “great school,” with its three classes; and the\r\n“small school,” with two.[2] What he had done for the education\r\nof the girls M. Quiblier would do for the boys, and it is due to\r\nhim that he succeeded in bringing the Brothers of the Christian\r\nSchools to Montreal in 1837. A tribute paid by the Hon. Jacques\r\nViger to M. Quiblier and the Sulpicians may be quoted from a\r\nPrécis Historique which he composed. “Sur les petites écoles\r\nde la paroisse de Montréal pour les garçons.” “Should the time\r\ncome,” he says, “when the Gentlemen of the Seminary might have no\r\nother right to public recognition than that of having constantly\r\nexercised their generous zeal for education undying blessings\r\nshould be their desert; and if M. Quiblier had no other title of\r\nglory beyond that of having surpassed his predecessors in that\r\nrespect that title would be fine enough. * * * Such are, among\r\nthe other good works of the house of St. Sulpice, those which it\r\nhas never ceased to lavish on the progress of education in a town\r\nof which it can, with good cause, be called the foundress and the\r\nmother.”\r\n\r\nMr. Huguet-Latour, in his “Annuaire de Ville Marie,” notes some\r\nof the schools of this period as follows. It is interesting as\r\nshowing the part then being played by the laity:\r\n\r\n“On May 1, 1813, a school was founded for young girls by Mrs.\r\nRichard O’Keefe.\r\n\r\n“About 1819 a school was founded by a Mr. Ryan in the house of\r\nthe ‘Recollets.’\r\n\r\n“In 1825 a school for boys was established by Mgr. Lartigue, on\r\nOctober 1st, on the ground floor of his Episcopal residence at\r\nSt. James Church, and another for girls, on January 3, 1827,\r\nunder the direction of his secretary, afterwards Bishop Bourget,\r\nin a house hired for the purpose. In 1828 the sewing classes\r\nbegan in this school under the direction of the ‘Association\r\nBienveillante des Dames de St. Jacques.’ These lasted till 1853.\r\nIn 1831 these ladies, while still maintaining the supervision,\r\nhired a mistress to teach the school. On October 1st of the same\r\nyear, Mgr. Lartigue opened a school for English boys, in the\r\nbasement of the Sacristy of his cathedral.\r\n\r\n“In 1830 a third class for boys was added. The first schoolhouse\r\nof St. James (75 by 40 feet, with three stories) was built in\r\n1831 on land given by Mgr. Lartigue in 1831. Thither the various\r\nclasses connected with St. James were transferred in 1831 and\r\n1832. This school suffered, with the Cathedral, destruction in\r\nthe great fire of July 8, 1852. The school, which commenced in\r\n1825 with sixty children, had reached 400.\r\n\r\n“On July 7, 1834, a school was founded at No. 31 Beaudry Street\r\nby Mr. Joseph Bourgoin.”\r\n\r\nAs a summary of the general outlook on Canadian education in the\r\nProvince of Quebec[3] at the time of the rebellion we may use\r\nLord Durham’s own summing up in his famous report in preparation\r\nfor the Union. “The bulk of the population is composed of the\r\nhard-working yeomanry of the country district commonly called\r\nhabitants. * * * It is impossible to exaggerate the want of\r\neducation among them; no means of instruction have been provided\r\nfor them and they are almost universally destitute of the\r\nqualifications even of reading and writing. * * * The common\r\nassertion that all classes of Canadians are equally ignorant is\r\nperfectly erroneous; for I know of no people among whom a larger\r\nprovision exists for the higher kinds of elementary education\r\nor among whom such education is really extended to a larger\r\nproportion of the population. The piety and benevolence of the\r\nearly possessors of the country founded in the seminaries that\r\nexist in the different parts of the province, institutions of\r\nwhich the funds have long been directed to the promotion of\r\neducation. Seminaries and colleges have been by these bodies\r\nestablished in the cities and in other central points. The\r\neducation given in these establishments greatly resembles the\r\nkind given in the English public schools, though it is more\r\nvaried. It is entirely in the hands of the Catholic clergy. The\r\nnumber of pupils in this establishment was estimated altogether\r\nat 1,000 and they turn out as far as I could ascertain between\r\ntwo and three hundred young men thus educted.”\r\n\r\nThus at the time of the rebellion of 1837, at least in the towns\r\nsuch as Montreal, the outlook on education was not so depressing\r\nas it is generally painted.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              NOTE\r\n\r\nThe long drawn out question of the Jesuits’ estates was settled\r\nin 1888. Its history may now be recapituated. After the\r\nsuppresssion of the society in 1773, the government waited until\r\nthe death, in 1801, of Father Casot, the last Canadian Jesuit\r\nto claim them. Amherst had been promised them, but the public\r\nsentiment was against this, and they were demanded for the cause\r\nof public education. The Jesuits meanwhile always maintained that\r\nthere was an implicit contract on the part of the government to\r\nrestore them. Up to 1888 the yearly revenues accruing had become\r\nvery great. In 1800 these reached the sum of $7,800; in 1812 that\r\nof more than $9,000; in 1822, $6,000; in 1831, $15,000; in 1840,\r\n$27,000; in 1852, $45,000; during the other years more or less\r\nconsiderable sums. The total is about $960,000. If there is added\r\nto that the use of the lands of Champ de Mars, the courthouse and\r\nthe city hall, and the land of the college at Quebec, it will be\r\nseen that the amount reached nearly two million dollars’ revenue.\r\nThe value of the estates themselves resulting from the donations\r\nmade by the kings of France and rich individuals was about four\r\nto five millions. Evidently all this could not all be returned.\r\nIt became a question of indemnity. In 1874 the Jesuits demanded\r\nsuch. Father Braun composed a memorial to Rome on the point,\r\nand Father Chazaux, then superior, addressed a request to the\r\ngovernment in the name of the Holy See which had consented to the\r\ndemand for the indemnity.\r\n\r\nThere was delay until May 12, 1887, when the Quebec government\r\nincorporated the Society of Jesus, and on July 12, 1888, passed\r\nthe Jesuit estates bill, partially compensating the Society of\r\nJesus for their loss. On March 3d of the following year the\r\nCommons sustained the act respecting the Jesuit estates by a vote\r\nof 188 to 13. On June 11th the Equal Rights party formed up to\r\nprotest. On June 19th the Presbyterian Assembly denounced the act\r\nof incorporation of the Jesuits and the Jesuits estate act, and\r\nthe Anglican Synod did the same this month. In July a general\r\nmeeting in Queen’s Hall in Montreal also protested.\r\n\r\nA petition was at this time presented to the Governor-General,\r\nLord Stanley, requesting the disallowance of the act of March 3,\r\n1888, and in answer, on August 2d, he replied that the adverse\r\nadvice of his ministers, which he deemed sound, bound him to\r\nuphold it.\r\n\r\nOn November 5, 1889, the Hon. Honoré Mercier, the premier of the\r\nprovince of Quebec, paid to the Jesuits the sum of $400,000, of\r\nwhich $60,000 was turned over at once to the Protestant Board of\r\nSchool Commissioners for the province. The balance did not go\r\nsolely to the Jesuits, for Rome decided that of this the claims\r\nfor a share made by other Catholic-teaching bodies should be\r\nmaintained, so that eventually the Society of Jesus received\r\nbarely one-third of the indemnity. It is now clearly recognized\r\nthat an elemental act of justice was at last completed.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[1] See Haldimand’s remarks, Chapter X, Part 1.\r\n\r\n[2] “Mémoires particuliers pour servir a l’histoire de l’eglise\r\nde L’Amerique du Nord,” Tome 2 (vie de la Sœur Bourgeoys).\r\n\r\n[3] The census of 1911 revealed the interesting fact, that in\r\nview of some popular impressions erroneously entertained the\r\ngreatest proportion of children attending school for over six\r\nmonths in the year was noted in Quebec. It was 76.47 per cent.,\r\nand compares with 74.43 per cent. in Ontario, which comes next in\r\norder.

In 1841\r\nthe first parliament of United Canada passed an act embodying\r\nmany of Buller’s suggestions, providing for the establishment\r\nand maintenance of public education. An ex-officio chief\r\nsuperintendent of education was appointed for the united province\r\nwith working superintendents for its eastern and western\r\nsections. The executive educational officer, therefore, for lower\r\nCanada, was the Hon. Dr. J.B. Meilleur, an active educationalist\r\nand a former member of the legislature, who had been the\r\nprincipal author of the projected school act of 1836.\r\n\r\nIn 1843 the school act of 1841 was repealed as far as Upper\r\nCanada was concerned and in 1845 as far as it applied to Lower\r\nCanada. This was on account of the working experience gained by\r\nthe two superintendents. In 1846 the office of the ex-officio\r\nchief superintendent was abolished and each of the eastern and\r\nwestern executive officers now administered the school law which\r\nwas adopted by the act of 1846 to suit the needs of each section\r\nof the United Province. A very important principle--that of local\r\ntaxation for the support of education--introduced with success in\r\nUpper Canada--was substituted for that of voluntary contributions\r\nas an experiment. This was repealed in 1849, owing to strong\r\nopposition, and local assessment was rendered permissive, not\r\ncompulsory as before, and the system of voluntary contribution\r\nrestored.\r\n\r\nThe year 1846 marks the origin of the modern Protestant and\r\nCatholic school commissioners of the city of Montreal appointed\r\nby the provincial parliament (9 Victoria, Cap. 27).\r\n\r\n\r\n                      THE PROTESTANT BOARD\r\n\r\nThe Protestant Board at its inception was not incorporated by act\r\nof parliament and had little recognized status. It had no funds\r\nto administer except a small grant from the city council. It had\r\nno school buildings to superintend. The early practice was to\r\nsubsidize the existing schools. But the idea of the board grew.\r\nIt received doles occasionally from the city council and it made\r\nheadway. Its first school was the Ann Street School, established\r\nin a rented building, in 1850. It was afterward named the\r\n“William Lunn” after the first secretary-treasurer of the board,\r\nan ardent educationalist and one of the founders of the British\r\nand Canadian School.\r\n\r\nThe first meeting of the board of commissioners under the act\r\nof 1846 was held on December 10, 1846. Its commissioners up to\r\n1868-69 were:\r\n\r\nRev. Charles Bancroft, chairman, 1846 to 1848; Rev. Caleb Strong,\r\n1846 to ----; Rev. J.M. Cramp, 1846 to----; Mr. William Lunn,\r\nwho acted as secretary-treasurer from 1846 to 1871; Mr. Andrew\r\nWatson, 1846 to----; Mr. John Dougall, 1846 to----; Reverend Dr.\r\nFalloon, chairman, February, 1848, to October, 1848; Reverend\r\nDr. McGill, chairman, October, 1848 to 1856; Ven. Arch-deacon\r\nGilson, 1854 to 1856, chairman, 1856 to 1861; Rev. William\r\nSnodgrass, chairman, 1861 to 1865; Mr. Kemp,---- to 1865; Rev.\r\nJohn Jenkins, D.D., chairman, 1865 to 1868; chairman, February,\r\n1868, to February, 1869; Rev. D.H. MacVicar, D.D., LL. D., 1865\r\nto February, 1869; Hon. James Ferrier, senator, 1865 to February,\r\n1869; Mr. Hector Munro, 1865 to February, 1869.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       THE CATHOLIC BOARD\r\n\r\nThe Catholic board, also appointed in 1846, had similar\r\ndifficulties. The organization of the schools was small. The work\r\ndone was sincere, but woefully limited. The schools were small\r\nand not modern in structure and character. The teachers were few\r\nand sadly handicapped in every way, for at that time the chief\r\nthought was how to struggle along in a material way. The cause\r\nof Catholic education was greatly helped at this period by the\r\nadvent of the Christian Brothers in 1837, the Brothers of St.\r\nJoseph in 1841, and the religious bodies of women, including the\r\nLadies of the Sacred Heart in 1842, the Sisters of Providence in\r\n1844, the Ladies of St. Croix in 1847, and others, such as the\r\nSisters of the Holy Name of Jesus, the Sisters of Charity, etc.\r\n\r\nThe Catholic school commissioners from 1846 to 1868 were:\r\n\r\nVery Rev. A.F. Truteau, V.G., canon, 1846-1848; Rev. Francis A.U.\r\nde Charbonnel, P.S.S. (late bishop of Toronto), 1846-1848; Albert\r\nFurniss, 1846-1849; P.S. Letourneux, 1846-1849; Pierre Beaubien,\r\nphysician, 1846-1849; J.U. Beaubry, advocate (later judge of\r\nsupreme court), 1848-1862; Rev. A. Pinxsonnault (late bishop\r\nof London), 1848-1850, 1851-1853; Rev. F.R. Mercier, canon,\r\n1848-1849; Rev. J.H. Prevost, P.S.S., pastor of Notre Dame,\r\n1849-1864; A.M. Delisle, 1849-1852; W.C.F. Coffin, prothonotary,\r\n1849-1851; André Ouimet, advocate, 1849-1851; Rev. E.C. Fabre\r\n(afterwards archbishop of Montreal), 1850-1851, 1861-1865;\r\nG. d’Eschambault, physician, 1851-1856; P. Garnot, professor,\r\n1857-1861; Very Rev. H. Moreau, V.G., canon, 1853-1861; J.F.\r\nPelletier, advocate, 1853-1854; Louis Giard, physician,\r\n1855-1857, 1858-1860, 1861-1868; C.S. Cherrier, advocate,\r\n1857-1859; Gedeon Ouimet (afterward superintendent of public\r\ninstruction), 1859-1861; H. Kavanagh, inspector of customs,\r\n1860-1868; Edward Murphy, merchant (later senator), 1861-1865,\r\n1869-1880; Alfred Larocque, 1862-1865; Rev. A. Giband, P.S.S.,\r\n1864-1866; Rev. P.L. Leblanc, canon, 1865-1876; Louis Belanger,\r\nadvocate (later judge supreme court), 1865-1874; P.S. Murphy\r\n(later member of the council of public instruction), 1865-1884;\r\nRev. V. Rousselot, P.S.S., pastor of Notre Dame, 1866-1886;\r\nE.H. Trudel, physician, 1868-1869; Francis Cassidy, advocate,\r\n1868-1869.\r\n\r\n\r\n                  THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE BOARDS\r\n\r\nFrom 1846 to 1869 the school commissioners were appointed by the\r\ncorporation of Montreal to hold office for two years. Since 1869\r\nthree are appointed by the provincial government and three by the\r\ncorporation for three years.\r\n\r\nIn 1856 two bills, regarding higher and elementary education,\r\nbecame law on the report of Doctor Meilleur. They provided, among\r\nother things, for the distribution, through the superintendent\r\nof education and on his report, of the Lower Canada superior\r\neducation fund among the various universities, colleges,\r\nacademies, and model schools; for the establishment of three\r\nmodel schools instead of one; the appointment of a council of\r\npublic instruction for Lower Canada; the publication of journals\r\nof education in English and French and the creation, as in Upper\r\nCanada, of a superannuated common school teachers’ fund.\r\n\r\nIn 1857 the long delayed establishment by government of normal\r\nschools at length took place. On the 2d of March the Jacques\r\nCartier and the McGill Normal Schools[1] were inaugurated with\r\nfitting ceremonies at Montreal, to be followed in May by the\r\nLaval Normal School at Quebec. The Protestant Normal School at\r\nMontreal was established in the Belmont Street School until the\r\nMacdonald College Normal School was opened. Several private\r\nattempts to provide normal schools had been made, however, before\r\nthis date. In 1854 a model school was opened on Bonaventure\r\nStreet (St. James), maintained by the Colonial Church and School\r\nSociety as one of a group of Protestant schools throughout the\r\nDominion. This society (formerly the “Church Colonial Society”\r\nand the “Newfoundland School Society”), in connection with the\r\nChurch of England, originated in London in 1823; it extended to\r\nCanada in 1838. In January, 1851, the two societies were united\r\nand became the “Colonial Church and School Society.” In May,\r\n1861, it became the “Continental Church and School Society.” In\r\n1863, 105 schools had been established, or at one time aided, by\r\nthis society.\r\n\r\nThe school laws relating to the city of Montreal were amended by\r\nthe act of 1868-69, and the present system firmly established\r\nby charters of incorporation being granted to both Protestant\r\nand Catholic boards to the effect that the Roman Catholic and\r\nProtestant boards of school commissioners of the city of Montreal\r\nhave always been and now are bodies politic and corporate, and\r\nas such have always enjoyed and now enjoy all the rights and\r\nprivileges of corporation under the respective names of “the\r\nRoman Catholic board of school commissioners of the city of\r\nMontreal” and the “Protestant board of school commissioners of\r\nthe city of Montreal,” as the case may be. The commissioners\r\nwere to have a right to hold real estate to any amount. The\r\nannual revenue to be paid by the government was to be according\r\nto the relative proportion of the Roman Catholic and Protestant\r\npopulations in the city. In addition there was to be a special\r\ncity school tax collected by the city so that the corporation\r\nshould pay for division among both boards, a tax assessable on\r\nreal estate payable by the proprietors equal to a stated per\r\ncent on the dollar.[2] The proprietors were placed under four\r\npanels, Roman Catholics, Protestants, neutral school tax from\r\ncorporations or incorporated companies, or of those that have not\r\ndeclared in writing their desires to be inscribed on panels 1 or\r\n2, and owners of real estate exempted from taxation. The neutral\r\ntax to be paid by corporations in proportion to the value of the\r\nproperty inscribed on panel 3 was to be divided between the Roman\r\nCatholic and Protestant boards according to the relative ratio\r\nof the Roman Catholic and Protestant population in the city, and\r\nthe remainder in the relative ratio of the value of the property\r\ninscribed on panels 1 and 2 respectively. Jews[3] were empowered\r\nto inscribe on either of panels 1 or 2. Further source of revenue\r\nmight come from additional amounts granted by the corporation of\r\nthe city or from monthly school fees according to the nature of\r\nthe schools, elementary, normal or academic, and from the issue\r\nof debentures, bonds, etc.\r\n\r\nSince the passing of this act the progress in education has been\r\nvery great, the number and dignity of the school buildings being\r\nmarked.\r\n\r\nGradually most of the private schools came under the various\r\ncommissions.\r\n\r\nIn 1870 the “old” Protestant high school came under the new\r\nboard. Its history as the fostering ground of so many prominent\r\ncitizens deserves special mention. The school opened September\r\n25, 1843, with sixty-five pupils, in the Bigham building on St.\r\nDenis Street, near Notre Dame Street. It was founded about 1843,\r\nand shortly after its organization the Royal Grammar School was\r\nmerged into it. The next home was in the semi-ecclesiastical\r\nbuildings on Belmont Street, the cornerstone of this erection\r\nhaving been laid by Lord Metcalfe Governor-General, on July 11,\r\n1845, after the act of incorporation in the same year.[4] Shortly\r\nbefore 1857 the high school was transferred to the premises now\r\nused by the Fraser Library and Institute. Its first principal\r\nwas the Rev. George Foster Simpson. On his resignation Reverend\r\nDr. Howe succeeded in 1848, and on his retirement in 1891 he was\r\nfollowed by the Rev. Dr. Elson S. Rexford, to be succeeded in\r\n1904 by the present principal, Mr. Wellington Dixon.\r\n\r\n“This school was in many respects,” said one who remembers it\r\nwell, “a worthy example of this type. The masters whom I recall\r\nwere the rector, Dr. H. Aspinwall Howe, brisk, alert, competent,\r\nself-possessed, showing many of the qualities of an English\r\nparsonage and of an Irish breeding; Mr. Rodger, stern, just,\r\na Scotchman of serious type, an aquamarine set in steel, was\r\nhighly regarded by his pupils for his unswerving uprightness;\r\nMr. Gibson, tall, spare, peering, of classical proclivities;\r\nMr. (later Doctor) Murray, a short, rotund Englishman, whose\r\nstrong point was not discipline and whose pupils in their noisy\r\nacclamation wore with their heels a long, deep trench in front\r\nof their recitation form; Mr. Tronteau, instructor in French,\r\nwho lacked that final something which commands the respect of\r\nBritish boys. Disciplinary trouble caused his retirement shortly\r\nafterward.” Other contemporaries and pupils of Doctor Murray\r\nremember him as a most lovable man, a lover of his kind, a\r\ndeep scholar, a thinker with a brilliant pen and a high poetic\r\nand critical faculty. Another teacher closely connected with\r\nDoctor Howe was Dr. S.P. Robins, who became one of the foremost\r\neducationalists in Canada. The old high school, the scholarly\r\ngentlemen who taught this and its other memories are regarded\r\nwith veneration by the Protestant grandfathers of Montreal of\r\ntoday who gathered there their love of culture and their upright\r\nprinciples under its successive roofs.\r\n\r\nThe next location of the high school was on Peel Street. It was\r\nhanded over to the school commissioners in 1870.[5]\r\n\r\nIn 1890 it was destroyed by the act of foolish boy incendiaries.\r\nBut a more commodious building was erected on the same site and\r\ncontinued its progressive work till 1914, when it was sold. In\r\nthe meantime the new high school, a handsome building, being\r\nprepared on University Street, above Sherbrooke Street, was\r\nopened on September 8, 1914, to receive its new generation.\r\n\r\nThe past commissioners under the act of 1868-69 are as follows:\r\n\r\nRev.

The above are only those schools\r\ncontrolled by the “Montreal Catholic school board” which is no\r\nlonger an exact expression.\r\n\r\nFor it must be understood that while from a municipal point of\r\nview, the City of Montreal has grown by successive annexations\r\nwhich have considerably enlarged its territory and the number of\r\nits inhabitants, nevertheless the Catholic School Board has not\r\nenlarged its domain. Its jurisdiction is exercised only within\r\nthe limits of the old city before annexations. The towns and\r\nvillages lately annexed have preserved their school autonomy, so\r\nthat what with the towns or villages annexed for municipal, but\r\nnot for school purposes, and those not in any way annexed, there\r\nare altogether about thirty-two different school boards in what\r\nis considered the metropolis of Montreal.\r\n\r\nThere are now more pupils in the many schools of the territory\r\noutside the scope of the Central Commission than are under its\r\nregulation. This should be carefully understood, else the\r\nabove list would indeed look small for so large a Catholic city.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE OLD “BLACK” NUNNERY The northeast portion of\r\nthe garden of the convent of the “Congregation de Notre Dame,”\r\nfounded by Marguerite Bourgeoys in 1659. The present buildings\r\nare those of the third convent, the previous two having been\r\nburned. The projected extension of St. Lawrence Boulevard to\r\nthe harbor necessitates the demolition of the convent and the\r\nadjoining church of Notre Dame de Pitie.]\r\n\r\n\r\n        WOMEN TEACHING ORGANIZATIONS--THE “CONGREGATION”\r\n\r\nThe chief women organizations at present cooperating with the\r\nCatholic school commission have an interesting history. The early\r\nhistory of the pioneering work for education in Montreal by the\r\nCongregation Nuns has been told in the first volume. To resume in\r\nbrief, on November 25, 1657, Marguerite Bourgeoys, with Madame\r\nMarguerite Pacaud, opened the first school proper, in Montreal\r\nin a stable (36 by 18 feet) given by M. de Maisonneuve, facing\r\nthe Hôtel Diéu on St. Paul Street. In 1666 a boarding school\r\nfor young girls was opened by her. In 1670, the stable being\r\ninsufficient, a large house in stone was built. In 1683 the house\r\nwas burnt down and two of her community, Géneviève Durosoy and\r\nMarguerite Soumillard perished. The Congregation immediately\r\ncommenced, with only 40 sols, to build their house in the “haut\r\nville,” on ground donated to them adjoining the Hôtel Diéu. This\r\nwas the site on which the subsequent convent additions were built\r\nand which has recently, in 1912, been purchased by the city for\r\nthe elongation of St. Lawrence Boulevard. In 1713 the northeast\r\nwing of the convent was commenced for a “pensionnat” which\r\nreceived a foundation of 13,000 _livres_ from Jeanne Le Ber, the\r\nrecluse of Notre Dame de Pitié church, erected since 1693 in the\r\nconvent grounds. The revenue from this sum was to educate and\r\nboard gratuitously seven young girls. In 1768, on April 11th, a\r\nsecond fire destroyed all the buildings of the convent. In 1823\r\nthe Sisters added to their establishment a three-story building.\r\nWhen the great movement for popular education was promoted in\r\n1833 by M. Quiblier, superior of the Seminary, some of the\r\nSisters left their convent to open extern free day schools,\r\nfirst, Externat Ste. Marie, opened September 21, 1833, on Craig\r\nand Visitation streets, and, second, Externat St. Laurent, 324\r\nSt. Catherine Street, to be followed, in successive years till\r\ntoday, by other “externats,” a course which has entitled them to\r\nmuch public recognition. In 1845 the nuns adjoined the annex to\r\nthe _pensionnat_--a building 300 by 57 feet, erected on St. Jean\r\nBaptiste Street. In 1854 a second _pensionnat_ was added, called\r\n“Villa Maria” by the purchase of Monklands, a residence southwest\r\nof Mountain, the original home of the “Monk” family, which became\r\nthe official residence of the governor general. It was there that\r\nLord Elgin retired after signing the rebellion losses bill. In\r\n1860 the original pensionnat, dating from 1666, was removed from\r\nthe old site to Mount St. Mary, to the building used as the St.\r\nPatrick’s Hospital for the Irish from 1852 to 1860, and before\r\nthat as a Baptist college.\r\n\r\nIn 1880 the mother house and the novitiate were transferred\r\nto the western slope of Mount Royal, near Villa Maria. The\r\nhandsome new building was burnt to the ground on June 8, 1893.\r\nThe community returned to their old home on St. Jean Baptiste\r\nStreet, which in the meantime had been used as the normal school\r\nentrusted to the nuns, since 1898, for the education of female\r\nbodies for the Province. But a new mother house was preparing;\r\nwhich they entered in July, 1908. It is an immense building, one\r\nof the largest in the world devoted to religious purposes. It is\r\nbuilt in the Romanesque style. This building is the home of the\r\ncollege for the higher education of women in affiliation with\r\nLaval University.\r\n\r\nThe Normal School for girls to be trained for Catholic teachers\r\nfor the Province of Quebec has been connected with their\r\norganization since its foundation, on September 14, 1898.\r\n\r\n\r\n           SISTERS OF THE HOLY NAMES OF JESUS AND MARY\r\n\r\nThe institution of the Sisters of the Holy Names of Jesus and\r\nMary is a Montreal foundation which has spread over Canada,\r\nOregon, California, and many parts of the United States. It\r\nhad for its foundress Mlles. Eulalie Durocher (afterwards, in\r\nreligion, Mother Maria Rose), Melodie Dufresne and Henriette\r\nCéré, who began their work of teaching the young in October,\r\n1843, in a modest house in Longueuil. In 1844 it was formed into\r\na religious community and the Sisters took possession of their\r\nconvent there. On December 8th the foundresses took their first\r\nreligious vows and on August 15, 1846, their final vows. The work\r\nof teaching may be said to be definitely founded in 1845. It has\r\nsteadily progressed. The Sisters have about 27,470 children who\r\nattended school under their charge in 1913. They have fifty-six\r\nestablishments and direct twenty-five parochial schools in Canada\r\nalone.\r\n\r\nIts principal schools are the Hochelaga Convent and the imposing\r\nconvent at Outremont, on St. Catherine Road.\r\n\r\nOn the Eastern slope of Mount Royal, built on one of the\r\nchoicest sites of Montreal, is the Outremont boarding-school. A\r\nmagnificent panorama of the surrounding country may be seen from\r\nthe upper steps of the Convent. The immense cutstone building, of\r\nmodern architecture, is surrounded by verdant lawns and gravel\r\nwalks, whereon the pupils may indulge in all the pastimes of\r\nconvent life. The course of studies is the same as at Hochelaga,\r\nalthough the appointments may be more modern. A beautiful white\r\nchapel, with its marble altars, burnished brass communion-table\r\nand stained glass windows, is worthy of attention. A museum is\r\nlocated in the dome which overtops the building.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    SISTERS OF THE HOLY CROSS\r\n\r\nAnother body cooperating with the Catholic School Commission,\r\nis that of the Congregation of the Sisters of the Holy Cross,\r\nfounded in 1841, at Mans, France, by Father Anthony Moreau and\r\nMother Mary of the Seven Dolors, née Leocadie Gascoin. In May,\r\n1847, at the formal request of Rev. J.B. Saint Germain, Pastor\r\nof St. Laurent, Bishop Bourget, on his return from Europe,\r\nbrought three nuns from this recently organized institute to\r\nestablish a branch in Canada. Its beginnings were very humble\r\nand, perhaps on account of its distance from the mother-house, it\r\nmade little progress during the first thirty-five years of its\r\nexistence. After this ordeal, it suddenly underwent a wonderful\r\ntransformation and now numbers 623 members, 530 professed and\r\n98 novices, and owns 40 prosperous houses situated in three\r\nprovinces, wherein upwards of 14,000 children are educated. The\r\nConvent still occupies its original site, but has undergone so\r\nmany improvements that it is now as fine and massive a structure\r\nas any of the more modern buildings. The boarding-school,\r\nattached to the mother-house and novitiate, Notre Dame Des\r\nAnges, offers every facility for the physical and intellectual\r\ndevelopment of youth. The course comprises a term of nine\r\nyears. There are 250 pupils under tuition. The house confers\r\ndiplomas on such as graduate with honors. Its fine museum is\r\nnoted for its rare collections and for their intelligent and\r\nscientific classification; its physical-culture class caters to\r\nthe requirements of modern ideas; its vast library contains 4,500\r\nvolumes, the best works of French and English authors.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HIGHER EDUCATION FOR WOMEN: Royal Victoria College]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HIGHER EDUCATION FOR WOMEN: Mother House of the\r\nCongregation De Notre Dame]\r\n\r\n\r\nSt. Basil’s Boarding School was erected in 1895, and opened the\r\nfollowing year under the supervision of the Sisters of the Holy\r\nCross. More than 350 pupils take the full English and French\r\ncourse, and are eventually awarded the diploma of the house,\r\nor the academic, if they pass the examination of the Board of\r\nCatholic Examiners of the Province of Quebec.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       SISTERS OF ST. ANNE\r\n\r\nThe Sisters of St. Anne is another teaching congregation\r\nassisting the Catholic School Commission. It was founded at\r\nVaudreuil in 1850 by Miss Esther Lureau dit Blondin. The order\r\nnow extends over four provinces of which two are in Canada,\r\nwith 54 houses of which 21 are at the diocese of Montreal.\r\nThe convent at Lachine, formerly the residence of Sir George\r\nSimpson, governor of the Hudson’s Bay Company, is their chief\r\nestablishment in Montreal; another is the large boarding-house at\r\nSt. Henri.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       OTHER CONGREGATIONS\r\n\r\nAmong the congregations not primarily teaching organizations, but\r\ncharitable institutions with schools attached to the Board, the\r\nSisters of Providence conducting the schools of the orphanage of\r\nSt. Alexis founded in 1864, and schools of St. Vincent de Paul,\r\nand of the Jardin de L’Enfance founded in 1881. This congregation\r\naccepts a subsidy from the School Commission. It also teaches the\r\nSchool of the Deaf Mutes, but not under the Commission as in the\r\nother case.\r\n\r\nThe Grey Nuns also receive subsidies under the Commission for\r\ntheir instruction in the classes of l’Asyle Bethlehem on Richmond\r\nSquare, founded by the Hon. C.S. Rodier and “Nazareth” Asylum on\r\nSt. Catherine Street, founded in 1860, for the blind. The history\r\nof these organizations will be found in another section.\r\n\r\n\r\n                  MEN’S TEACHING ORGANIZATIONS\r\n\r\nThe coming of the Brothers of the Christian Schools to Montreal\r\nin 1837 must be chronicled at some length since the modern\r\nCatholic primary educational system for the boys of the city\r\nhas been so largely under their hands. The first project of the\r\nestablishment in Canada of the “Christian” Brothers, as they are\r\nnow popularly called, dates back as far as the year before the\r\ndeath of the founder of the institute, St. Jean Baptiste de la\r\nSalle, 1718, but negotiations were broken off. In 1733 Brothers\r\nDenis and Pacificus were sent to Montreal to study the situation,\r\nbut with no results. Nearly a century later, in 1830, the\r\nsuperior of the seminary and vicar general of the diocese, Abbé\r\nQuiblier, made overtures to Brother Anacletus, who then governed\r\nthe institute, for a settlement for the brothers to teach the\r\nboys whose education had never been so systematically organized\r\nas that of the girls. Numbers being small, it was not till 1837,\r\non November 7th, that three brothers, the first to visit America,\r\narrived at the seminary, where they were entertained as guests\r\nfor six months, till they were installed in their first novitiate\r\non St. Francois Xavier Street, the gift of the Sulpicians, in a\r\nhouse adjoining the school. On December 23, 1837, they commenced\r\ntheir classes in the seminary building. Two classes were\r\nimmediately filled, to be quickly succeeded by a third.\r\n\r\nAs the scholars grew M. Quiblier acquired for the brothers an\r\nold country house of one of the governors of Montreal in Coté\r\nStreet, which formed a second novitiate and a temporary school.\r\nIn 1840 there was added, parallel to the novitiate, a new school\r\n(St. Lawrence) built in stone and in 1841 there were in the two\r\nschools eight classes with 860 scholars who were visited by a\r\nLord Sydenham. In 1842 the brothers began to wear the three\r\ncornered caps of their congregation, now so familiar on the\r\nstreets in Montreal. Up to this they had not been permitted\r\nthis privilege. The prejudice against the body of religious not\r\npriests wearing a religious habit will be remembered by those\r\nfamiliar with the history of the Charron Brothers before the\r\nEnglish regime.\r\n\r\nFurther French classes were opened by them. In 1843 two special\r\nclasses for the Irish children were begun in the old convent\r\nof the Récollets. In 1843, also, the Brothers were invited to\r\nQuebec and later to other places in Canada and in America.\r\nAgain Montreal is seen as the distributing point of influence\r\nthrough education. A French-Canadian journal has said: “Ce grain\r\nde senevé, jeté sur les rives du St. Laurent a donné naissance\r\nà un arbre magnifique dort les rameaux bienfaisants ombrageat\r\nles principaux centres du Canada et des Etats Unis.” The\r\nnumerous homes of education of this body and the lists of their\r\neducational output of school text-books deserve a more prolonged\r\nstudy than space permits here. The Brothers have done for the\r\nboys the work that the Congregation of Marguerite Bourgeoys has\r\ndone for the girls. At present, around Montreal alone, these have\r\nover twenty communities presiding over colleges or schools.\r\n\r\nBesides their many elementary schools, the Brothers of the\r\nChristian Schools have the large “Collège de Mont St. Louis”\r\non Sherbrooke Street, which being divided into three courses,\r\nelementary, commercial and scientific, prepares its pupils for\r\nthe polytechnical schools and the different university courses.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       OTHER ORGANIZATIONS\r\n\r\nOf the male teaching religious organizations acting under the\r\nCommission there are the “Sacred Heart,” the “Marist,” the St.\r\nGabriel, and the “Presentation” Brothers, and the Brothers of the\r\nChristian Schools.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         --LAY TEACHERS\r\n\r\nA third class of those cooperating with the board are the\r\nlayteachers. The early teachers especially are deserving of\r\nevery praise for their efforts to meet the call for education.\r\nWe have already indicated the names of some of those who taught\r\nschool before the Union, a partial list of others who worked for\r\nthe most part independently of any support chiefly during the\r\nfirst School Act between 1846 and 1868 may be a fitting tribute.\r\nThe dates subjoined give the official opening of school, the\r\nname being the principal.

These are supplied by private\r\ncitizens or corporate bodies; among them may be mentioned: Miss\r\nEdgar’s School, 507 Guy Street; Lower Canada College, Notre Dame\r\nde Grâce; the Catholic High School (Presentation Brothers),\r\nDurocher Street; Lyola College, Drummond Street; St. Marie’s\r\nCollege, Bleury Street; the Convent of the Ladies of the Sacred\r\nHeart, St. Alexander Street and Sault au Récollet; St. Laurent’s\r\nCollege (Holy Cross Brothers); Mort St. Louis College (Christian\r\nBrothers), Sherbrooke Street; and the academies for advanced\r\neducation in connection with the different teaching Brotherhoods\r\nand Sisterhoods.\r\n\r\nThere are also many business schools.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             NOTE II\r\n\r\n   TECHNICAL, COMMERCIAL AND VOCATIONAL EDUCATION IN MONTREAL\r\n\r\nThe earliest attempt at technical education before the\r\ncapitulation of 1760 will be found in Vol. I, Under The French\r\nRégime. The modern movement remains to be chronicled.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                I\r\n\r\n               THE BOARD OF ARTS AND MANUFACTURES\r\n\r\nIn 1859 the Board of Arts and Manufactures of Lower Canada\r\nestablished a central school at Montreal.\r\n\r\nIn 1872, the Council of Arts and Manufactures made an attempt\r\nto put technical education on its feet. Hitherto the progress\r\nof industry had not been sufficiently perceived. The growth\r\nof manufactures following upon the National policy made the\r\nexperiment more necessary. The early equipment was meager, the\r\nmeans small, and there were but few classes and few pupils.\r\nStill steady progress was made. In 1898 Mr. Thomas Gauthier\r\nbecame president and long steps in advance were made. There are\r\nnow nearly three thousand pupils over the Province of Quebec,\r\nin Montreal, Quebec, St. Hyacinthe, Sherbrooke, Three Rivers,\r\nSt. Jean, Lachine, Valleyfield, Sorel, Fraserville, Charny, St.\r\nRomuald, and Chicoutimi.\r\n\r\nIn Montreal alone there are over one thousand five hundred and\r\nten pupils in four schools, of which the Monument National is the\r\nmost important.\r\n\r\n\r\n              COMMERCIAL AND TECHNICAL HIGH SCHOOL\r\n\r\nTechnical night schools are also provided at the Commercial and\r\nTechnical High School, the successor of the Montreal Senior\r\nSchool. This latter school was organized by the Protestant Board\r\nof School Commissioners in September, 1877, to accommodate the\r\nclasses of what was then known as the second senior grade of\r\nthe public elementary schools. For a year the school met in a\r\nbuilding on Ontario Street, between Bleury and Mance streets,\r\nand in 1878 was transferred to the old high school building at\r\nthe corner of Dorchester and University streets, now the Fraser\r\nInstitute, and in 1883 to the building on Burnside Place between\r\nMetcalfe and Peel streets.\r\n\r\nIn 1906 the course of study of the Montreal Senior School was\r\nrevised, its name changed to the Commercial and Technical High\r\nSchool, and the school moved to its new building at 53 Sherbrooke\r\nStreet West.\r\n\r\nThe former principals of the Montreal Senior School have been:\r\nF.S. Haight, M.A., 1877-1883; Alexander Pearson, 1883-1884; J.\r\nMacKercher, M.A., LL. D., 1884-1906.\r\n\r\nSince becoming the Commercial and Technical High School they\r\nhave been: J. MacKercher, M.A., LL. D., 1906-1914; E. Montgomery\r\nCampbell, B.A., 1914.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    MONTREAL TECHNICAL SCHOOL\r\n\r\nIn 1911 the “Ecole Technique,” or the Montreal Technical School,\r\nmaintained partly by the provincial and municipal governments by\r\na contribution of $40,000, each, opened its courses in September.\r\nIts buildings, covering a space of 150,000 square feet, are on\r\nSherbrooke Street, facing St. Famille Street. It is claimed with\r\njustice that it is equipped as well as any technical building of\r\nmodern times. It is undenominational and it has also a French and\r\nan English side. There is in addition a further training school\r\nin the applied sciences, the “Polytechnique,” founded in 1874,\r\nwhich, having become affiliated, 1887, with Laval University is\r\ndescribed elsewhere.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HAUTES ETUDES COMMERCIALES]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MONTREAL TECHNICAL SCHOOL]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: COMMERCIAL AND TECHNICAL HIGH SCHOOL]\r\n\r\n\r\n                               II\r\n\r\n              ECOLE DES HAUTES ETUDES COMMERCIALES\r\n\r\nA further school of a university character, but not affiliated\r\nwith Laval or McGill universities, is the “Ecole des Hautes\r\nEtudes Commerciales.” It was established in 1910, being opened\r\non October 4th of that year, in its imposing buildings on Place\r\nViger under the protection of the government of the province by\r\nthe Premier, Sir Lomer Gouin, the first stone having been placed\r\nin October, 1908. The building cost $100,000 and was erected by\r\nMM. Gauthier and Daoust.\r\n\r\nThe object was to give a university college course in commerce\r\nleading up to a doctorate in commercial science such as is\r\ngiven in Europe under the title of “Ecoles des Hautes Etudes\r\nCommerciales,” the English translation of which is a misnomer, as\r\nit leaves the impression of the college being a mere “business\r\nschool.” It is distinctly a forward movement for Canada. The\r\ntuition extends over a period of three years and includes\r\ninstruction in general commercial affairs, banking, stock\r\nexchange and insurance business, and in the third year industrial\r\nand maritime business. There are numerous laboratories in which\r\nthe chemistry of fabrics and other forms of analyses are taught.\r\n\r\nThe first board of administration was composed of: Isaie\r\nPrefontaine, president; Honoré Mercier, M.P.P.; J. Contant;\r\nH. Gervais, M.P.; C.F. Smith; and A.J. de Bray, the latter\r\nbeing the principal.

There was no provision specially\r\nmade for their education in the earlier education acts, but\r\nthey were admitted into the schools of either the Protestant or\r\nthe Catholic panels without question, so long as they remained\r\nfew in number. When, however, the Jewish children began to form\r\na very large percentage of those attending the public schools\r\ndifficulties arose, owing to the claim being made that the\r\ntaxes were not sufficient to cover the expense entailed. The\r\nproblem gave rise to considerable agitation, but eventually the\r\ndifficulty was overcome by an act passed through the Quebec\r\nLegislature in 1903 by which the rights of Jewish children to\r\neducation in public schools on exactly the same footing as\r\nthe children of Catholic and Protestant fellow-citizens were\r\nrecognized, and for educational purposes the Jewish taxpayers\r\nwere joined to the taxpayers of the Protestant panel, and all\r\nschools under this panel opened to them. These rights were\r\nsecured largely through the work of the Jewish Educational Rights\r\nMovement Committee, which included a large number of the leading\r\nJewish citizens of Montreal and which intrusted the legislative\r\nwork to Mr. S.W. Jacobs, K. C, and Mr. Maxwell Goldstein, K. C.\r\n\r\nEducation in the Hebrew language and literature, as well as\r\nreligious education, is attended to by special schools organized\r\nby the Jews of Montreal. The most important body for the study of\r\nthese branches is the Talmud Torah Association, which supports a\r\nvery large and important school.\r\n\r\n[4] The Royal Grammer School was merged into the High School\r\nabout this time. Its master, Mr. Skakel, died in 1848.\r\n\r\n[5] The first chairman of the High School under the newly\r\ncreated Board of Commissioners was Rev. John Jenkins. The\r\nsecretary-treasurer was Mr. William Lunn. The commissioners were\r\nRev. Canon Bancroft, Rev. Professor MacVicar, the Hon. James\r\nFerrier, Mr. Alderman Thomson. Mr. W.C. Baynes was the secretary.\r\nThe head-masters were Professor Howe, Mr. D. Rodgers, Mr. S.P.\r\nRobins; assistant masters, Mr. George Murray, Mr. J. Green, Prof.\r\nDarey, Mr. J.

Its founder,\r\nMr. James McGill, who was one of the apostles of higher education\r\nin Canada, was born on October 6, 1744, at Glasgow, Scotland. He\r\ncame to Montreal before the American Revolution with his brother\r\nAndrew, and became connected with the North West Company. He\r\nmarried Madame Desrivières, the widow of a French-Canadian. As a\r\ncitizen his name stands well, having represented the west ward\r\nin the assembly and having been appointed also a member of the\r\nlegislative council. At the outbreak of the War of 1812, he was a\r\nmilitia colonel and then, an old man, was made brigadier general.\r\nBy his will of January 8, 1811, Mr. James McGill, not having any\r\nchildren, had bequeathed his landed estate, consisting of about\r\nforty-six acres, on Burnside and University streets, to the value\r\nthen of £10,000,[1] and a like sum of money, for a university,\r\nbut although the college bearing his name was incorporated by a\r\nroyal charter in the year 1821, the bequest could not be used,\r\nits validity being disputed by his relatives.\r\n\r\nThe object of the gift was to found an Anglican college in a\r\nfuture provincial university, the erection of which had already\r\nbeen promised by the British government. Indeed, the citizens\r\nwere led to believe that such a university was to be established\r\nby George III and endowed with Crown lands.\r\n\r\nThe four trustees appointed under the will were directed to\r\nconvey the property of the bequest to the “Royal Institution\r\nfor the Advancement of Learning.” The conditions upon which the\r\nproperty was to be transferred were that the Royal Institution\r\nwould, within ten years after the testator’s decease, erect and\r\nestablish on his estate on Burnside and University streets, a\r\ncollege for the purpose of education and the advancement of\r\nlearning in this province and that the college, or one of the\r\ncolleges in the university, if established, should be named and\r\nperpetually be known and distinguished by the appellation of\r\n“McGill College.” Owing to persistent opposition by the leaders\r\nof one section of the people to any system of governmental\r\neducation and to the refusal by the legislature to make the\r\ngrants of land and money which had been promised, the proposed\r\nestablishment of a provincial university by the British\r\ngovernment was abandoned.\r\n\r\nIn so far as the McGill College was concerned, however, the Royal\r\nInstitution at once took action by applying for a royal charter.\r\nSuch was granted in 1821 and the Royal Institution prepared to\r\ntake possession of the estate. But owing to protracted litigation\r\nthis was not surrendered to them till 1829, when the work of\r\nteaching was begun in the incipient arts course and the faculty\r\nof medicine. That of medicine, however, had been in existence\r\nfive years previously as a teaching body under the name of the\r\nMontreal Medical Institution, with power to admit to practice but\r\nnot to confer degrees.\r\n\r\nSince this body afterwards became the medical faculty of McGill\r\nand saved the projected university from dying of inanition\r\nit is entitled to special recognition. Its origin is closely\r\nconnected with the founding of the general hospital. When this\r\ngreat charity was accomplished the attending medical staff was\r\ncomposed of the most prominent and ablest men in the city,\r\nDrs. W. Robertson, W. Caldwell, A.F. Holmes, J. Stephenson and\r\nH.P. Loedel. On October 20, 1822, these men met together “for\r\nthe purpose of taking into consideration the expediency of\r\nestablishing a medical school in this city,” and it was resolved\r\n“that the considerations which seemed to warrant so desirable an\r\nobject should be drawn out and laid before the next meeting of\r\nthe Board, to be held on the 27th of the same month, and that\r\nDrs. Stephenson and Holmes be appointed a committee for the said\r\npurpose.” Thus was started the first Canadian medical school,\r\nwhich afterwards, as we shall see, became the medical faculty of\r\nMcGill University. The school was called the “Montreal Medical\r\nInstitution,” and received the approval of Lord Dalhousie, the\r\nGovernor-in-Chief of Lower Canada, and he appointed the members\r\nof the Institution a Board of Examiners for the district of\r\nMontreal. Formerly these examinations had been conducted by a\r\nboard of army medical officers, appointed by the Governor.\r\n\r\nThe first course of lectures was given in 1824, in a small wooden\r\nhouse in Place d’Armes, the site of which is now occupied by\r\nthe Bank of Montreal. Twenty-five students attended the first\r\nsession, and for some years there was no increase in the number.\r\n\r\nThe following is the advertisement of the lectures:\r\n\r\nAnatomy and Physiology, J. Stephenson, M.D.; Chemistry and\r\nPharmacy, A.F. Holmes, M.D.; Practice of Physic, W. Caldwell,\r\nM.D.; Midwifery and Diseases of Women, W. Robertson, Esq.;\r\nMateria Medica, H.P. Loedel, Esq.;[2] Surgery, J. Stephenson,\r\nM.D. In the course of the summer, 1825: Botany, A. F. Holmes.\r\n\r\nThe leading spirits of the school were Stephenson and Holmes,\r\nboth Canadians, Stephenson by birth and Holmes by adoption, for\r\nhe arrived in the country when only four years of age. They\r\nboth received their preliminary education here and then went to\r\nEdinburgh, where they took their doctor’s degree. The Montreal\r\nMedical Institution, which afterwards became the Medical faculty\r\nof McGill University, was modelled on the lines of the Edinburgh\r\nUniversity, and to this day the McGill Medical faculty bears the\r\nmarks of its relationship to the Alma Mater of its founders.\r\n\r\nFor four years the Medical Institution continued its work, when,\r\nin 1828, to prevent the lapse of the McGill bequest to the\r\nresiduary legatees, the Montreal Medical Institution became the\r\nFaculty of Medicine of McGill University in this wise.\r\n\r\nOwing, as said, to litigation the Royal Institution could\r\nnot get possession of Mr. McGill’s’ bequest until 1829. Also\r\nit was a condition of the gift that lectures should be given\r\nwithin a certain number of years or the bequest would lapse\r\nand the property revert to the Desrivières family. Only one\r\nyear remained, and no arrangement having been made for the\r\nestablishment of a faculty of arts, in fact, no money being\r\navailable for that purpose, the Montreal Medical Institution was\r\nconstituted a faculty of the University and this was chiefly\r\naccomplished by the exertions of Doctor Stephenson, to whom the\r\nUniversity, in a large measure, owes the preservation of the\r\nbequest of the Hon. James McGill.\r\n\r\nThe governors of the Royal Institution held a meeting 29th\r\nJanuary, 1829, with the members of the medical school, and the\r\nfollowing minute occurs:\r\n\r\nAfter public business was over, the governors of the Corporation\r\nheld an interview with the members of the Medical Institution\r\n(Drs. Caldwell, Stephenson, Robertson, and Holmes), who had been\r\nrequested to attend a meeting for that purpose. Owing to this\r\ninterview it was resolved by the governors of the Corporation\r\nthat the members of the Montreal Medical Institution be engrafted\r\nin the College as its Medical faculty, it being understood and\r\nagreed upon between the contracting parties that, until the\r\npowers of the charter would be altered, one of their number only\r\nshould be university professor and the others lecturers. That\r\nthey should immediately enter upon the duties of their respective\r\noffices, all of which arrangements were agreed to. The first\r\nsession of the new Medical Faculty of McGill College was held in\r\n1829, with thirty-five students on the register. Thus the Medical\r\nsaved McGill University.\r\n\r\nThe staff of the university in 1829 was: Divinity, Rev. J.G.\r\nMountain, D.D. (Cambridge), principal; moral philosophy and\r\nlearned languages, Rev. J.L. Mills, D.D. (Oxford); history and\r\ncivil law, Rev. J. Strachan, D.D. (Aberdeen); mathematics and\r\nnatural philosophy, Rev. J. Wilson, A.N. (Oxford). The staff of\r\nthe Montreal Medical Institution, now become the Medical Faculty,\r\nin 1829 was: Lecturers, A.F. Holmes, M.D.; W. Caldwell, M.D.; J.\r\nStephenson, M.D.; and W. Robertson, M.D.\r\n\r\nAfter 1829 McGill College, rich in a charter, but poor in\r\nstudents and educational facilities, struggled on, unsupported\r\nby government amidst political rancour, financial embarrassment,\r\nand internal administrative difficulties, and almost extinct as\r\na body with university pretensions with the exception of its\r\nmedical and its art faculty, the latter being erected as such in\r\n1843 under the Rev. Dr. John Bethune, so long Rector of Montreal,\r\nthen acting as principal, till a number of citizens came to its\r\nsupport.\r\n\r\nDoctor Bethune’s dual position of principal and Rector of\r\nMontreal was not a happy one, especially in 1845, when he was\r\nin front of a movement to affix to the University a distinctly\r\nAnglican denominational stamp. The appointment of the principal\r\nwas consequently disallowed upon the advice of Mr. Gladstone.\r\nAn extract from his letter to Earl Cathcart is of interest and\r\nshows how desperate were its straits to merit such a complicated\r\nutterance:\r\n\r\n“Into the various and somewhat complicated charges which have\r\nbeen brought against Doctor Bethune, in his capacity as principal\r\nof the College, I do not find it necessary to enter; nor do I\r\nwish to state at the present moment any decided opinion as to\r\nthe extent to which the present condition of the Institution\r\nis, owing to the character and position of its principal. My\r\ndecisions are founded upon reasons which are not open to dispute:\r\nthe first, the weight of the Bishop’s authority together with\r\nyour own, independently of any reference to that of the Board\r\nof Visitors, which may be considered to be to some extent, at\r\nthis moment in dispute; next, the fact that Doctor Bethune did\r\nnot himself receive an university education, which I must hold\r\nto be, unless under circumstances of the rarest occurrence,\r\nan indispensable requisite of such a position as he occupies.\r\nTo these I am disposed to add, although I express the opinion\r\nwithout having had the advantage of learning what may be the view\r\nof the Lord Bishop in this particular, that I cannot think it\r\nexpedient that the offices of principal and professor of divinity\r\nin McGill College should be combined with that of Rector of\r\nMontreal. This circumstance is not much adverted to in the papers\r\nbefore me; but I am strongly impressed that the incongruity\r\nof this junction of important collegiate appointments with a\r\nno less important pastoral charge in the same person; either\r\nthe former or the latter of which, especially considering the\r\nlarge population of the town of Montreal, I must, as at present\r\nadvised, hold to be enough to occupy his individual attention.”\r\n\r\nIn 1851 its total income was only £540 per annum and even with\r\nthe small staff employed, the expenditure was £742, consequently\r\na large debt accumulated. A committee of Montreal merchants arose\r\nand relieved the stringency, an example which has never failed\r\nto be followed with like success in succeeding crises of its\r\ngrowth.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: McGILL UNIVERSITY BUILDINGS]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Engineering Building]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Medical Building]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Art Building]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Mining and Chemistry Building]\r\n\r\nIn 1852 an amended and favourable charter was secured. Its new\r\nera of progress was assured in 1855 by the advent of Dr. William\r\nDawson as the new principal, invited by the Hon. John Day,\r\nthe president of the board of governors, and backed up by the\r\npersonal solicitation of Sir Edward Head, the governor-general.\r\nHe was a young man, having been born at Pictou, Nova Scotia, on\r\nOctober 13, 1820. His studies were commenced at Pictou College\r\nand continued at the University of Edinburgh. In 1850 he was\r\nappointed superintendent of education for Nova Scotia and became\r\nsoon distinguished as a geologist and educationalist. On his\r\nappointment to McGill he found the little, feeble, struggling\r\ncollege with about eighty students, with two faculties, those of\r\narts and medicine, and the nucleus of a faculty of law begun in\r\n1853. The School of Medicine of this period sent out, however,\r\nsuch men as Duncan McCallum, George E. Fenwick, Robert Palmer\r\nHoward, William Wright, Sir James Grant, Robert Clark, and Sir\r\nWilliam Hingston of a later period.\r\n\r\nDr. Dawson has described his first impressions, which were\r\nanything but agreeable, in the following words: “Materially, the\r\nUniversity was represented by two blocks of unfinished and partly\r\nruined buildings, standing amid a wilderness of excavators and\r\nmasons’ rubbish; overgrown with weeds and bushes. The grounds\r\nwere unfenced, and pastured at will by herds of cattle, which,\r\nnot only cropped the grass, but browsed in the shrubs, leaving\r\nunhurt only one great elm, which still stands as the founder’s\r\ntree, and a few old oak and butternut trees, most of which have\r\nhad to give place to our new buildings. The only access from\r\nthe town was by a circuitous and ungraded car track, almost\r\nimpassable at night. The buildings had been abandoned by the new\r\nboard, and the classes of the Faculty of Arts were held in the\r\nupper story of a brick building in the town, the lowest part\r\nof which was occupied by the High School. I had been promised\r\na residence, and this I found was to be a portion of one of\r\nthe detached buildings aforesaid, the present eastern wing. It\r\nhad been imperfectly furnished, was destitute of nearly every\r\nrequisite of civilized life, and in front of it was a bank of\r\nrubbish and loose stone with a swamp below, while the interior\r\nwas in an indescribable state of dust and disrepair. Still, the\r\ngovernors had done the best they could in the circumstances.”\r\n\r\nIn 1892, when Sir William Dawson retired, he left it a university\r\nof the world, with about one thousand students and almost\r\neighty professors and lecturers. He added the faculties of\r\napplied science, which, though instituted in 1870, was regularly\r\norganized in 1878, comparative medicine and veterinary science.\r\nAs far back as 1870 he began to plan for the higher education\r\nof women, founding the Ladies’ Educational Association and the\r\nGirls’ High School. In 1883 he opened the Donalda department in\r\nthe faculty of arts, which after his resignation, developed into\r\nthe Royal Victoria College. During his régime the university\r\nbuildings began to appear on the campus, then a bare, almost\r\ntreeless, weedy, partly swampy field, bearing but small likeness\r\nto the present noble campus with its imposing piles of buildings\r\nand its fine avenue of Canadian trees.\r\n\r\nThe course in law begun in connection with the faculty of arts\r\nwas made a separate faculty in 1853. The course of applied\r\nscience was organized in 1856 in connection with the faculty of\r\narts. It did not become a special faculty till 1893. In 1855 two\r\ndetached stone erections, an arts building with a residence for\r\nthe principal about sixty feet to the east, stood there alone.\r\nThe medical building, in existence before the university was\r\nestablished in 1829, still stood downtown, its first location,\r\nthe original home of the Montreal Medical Institute, being No.\r\n22 St. James Street, within reasonable distance of the General\r\nHospital on Dorchester Street, with which its staff were closely\r\nconnected as its earliest physicians. Subsequently it moved to\r\nthe corner of Craig Street and St. George and again to Coté\r\nStreet. Shortly after 1855 the west wing of the present arts\r\nbuilding was added by Mr. William Molson for the purposes of a\r\nlibrary and convocation hall, and in the course of a few years\r\nboth these wings (the Molson Hall on the west and the principal’s\r\nresidence on the east) were joined to the center block. The\r\nwest wing was used as a university museum and the east for the\r\nchemical and natural science rooms and laboratories. All four\r\nparts are now devoted to entirely different uses. The Molson Hall\r\nserves chiefly as an examination room for arts students (having\r\nlong ago proved wholly inadequate for meetings of convocation),\r\nand when the Peter Redpath Library was erected in 1893 the\r\nlibrary portion of it became available for class-rooms. Both\r\nwings, with a story added, now contain only the regular lecture\r\nrooms of the Faculty of Arts and the principal’s residence serves\r\nseveral purposes--for the offices of the administration, the\r\nZoological department and the Faculty of Law.\r\n\r\nIt was not until 1872 that a medical building was provided on\r\nthe University campus. This building was enlarged in 1885 and\r\nagain in 1895--this time chiefly through the generosity of the\r\nlate Mr. John H.R. Molson. Further enlargement was found to be\r\nnecessary within two or three years afterward, and in 1895,\r\nthrough the bounty of Lord Strathcona, who remained during his\r\nlife, the mainstay of the Medical Faculty financially, extensions\r\nand alterations were made, at a cost of at least one hundred\r\nthousand dollars. The Faculty were thus enabled to provide for\r\nthe increasing demands upon them. The fire of 1907 destroyed the\r\noriginal building. The newer portion was, however, saved and\r\nthe work of the departments of medical chemistry, physiology\r\nand histology are still being carried on therein. To complete\r\nthe story of the Faculty it must be added that the fire was\r\nnot after all the worst thing that could have happened, for it\r\nnecessitated the erection of a new building. This has been placed\r\nat the corner of University Street and Pine Avenue (some distance\r\nnorth of the old site), on ground donated by Lord Strathcona, who\r\nalso generously contributed over half a million dollars towards\r\nits erection and equipment. It is one of the finest and most\r\nup-to-date structures for the purpose of medical education on the\r\ncontinent.\r\n\r\nIn 1905 the medical faculty of Bishop’s College, Lennoxville,\r\nestablished in 1871 by Drs. Charles Smallwood, A.D. David, Sir\r\nW.H. Hingston, E.H. Trenholme and Francis W. Trenholme, was\r\nabsorbed into that of McGill.\r\n\r\nBeyond the eminent men already mentioned McGill Medical Faculty\r\nhas had associated with it as professors men of wide European\r\nreputation, honoured by other universities. Among them have\r\nbeen Drs. Racey, Archibald Hall, O.T. Bruneau, S.E. Sewell,\r\nMacCallum, Fraser, Sutherland, Drake A. Hall, I. Crawford,\r\nWilliam Fraser, W.E. Scott, William Wright, Robert MacDonnell,\r\nRobert Palmer Howard, George Ross, George E. Fenwick, T.A.\r\nStarkey, Sir William Osler, W. Gardner, Sir T.G. Roddick, G.P.\r\nGirdwood, A.D. Blackader, H.A. La Fleur, H.S. Berkett, George\r\nArmstrong, F.E. Fenley, C.S. Martin, F.J. Shepherd, dean, and\r\nJ.G. Adami, Strathcona professor of bacteriology, the holder of\r\nthe Fothergill medal in 1914.\r\n\r\nThe third building on the campus, in what may be called the Greek\r\nstyle, was added in 1882--the Peter Redpath Museum. In 1889 a\r\nbequest of $57,137 by Thomas Workman enabled the Thomas Workman\r\nmechanical shops to be undertaken. In 1892 there followed the\r\nfirst Macdonald engineering building, with its annex, the Thomas\r\nWorkman shops, the Macdonald physics building and the Peter\r\nRedpath library building for the university library which had\r\nalready been organized in 1857.\r\n\r\nThe Faculty of Applied Science is perhaps the most striking\r\nexample of growth in connection with the University. Organized\r\nfirst as a department of the Faculty of Arts in 1856, it\r\ndeveloped rapidly, not however, “coming into its kingdom” until\r\nit was provided with a home of its own in 1893 by Sir William\r\nMacdonald, that most generous friend of scientific education in\r\nCanada. At that date there were 165 students in the Faculty,\r\ntoday there were 612 before the war of 1914 affected the\r\nattendance. The progress within the last few years under the able\r\nadministration of Dean Adams has been especially marked, the\r\nnumber of students having increased since his appointment, six\r\nyears ago, by 40 per cent.\r\n\r\nAs an expert in geology Dr. Frank D. Adams has an international\r\nreputation.\r\n\r\nIn 1895 Dr. William Peterson, who had recently resigned the post\r\nof principal of the University of Dundee, succeeded Sir William\r\nDawson and has maintained the high intellectual and material\r\nideals of his predecessor, while he has brought the university\r\nto be well esteemed among the universities of the world. The\r\nmaterial progress of the university has continued. Six new\r\nbuildings have been added to the above group, the Chemistry and\r\nMining Building in 1898, the Conservatorium of Music in 1904,\r\nStrathcona Hall, the home of the McGill Y.M. C.A. (strictly\r\nspeaking, however, not a University building) in 1905, the\r\nMcGill Union in 1906, and the New Medical Building in 1911. In\r\nthis list no account is taken of the imposing pile of buildings\r\nerected by Sir William Macdonald at Ste. Anne de Bellevue for\r\nthe purposes of education in agriculture and domestic science\r\nand for the training of teachers. The original property there\r\ncomprises 560 acres and the probable cost was two millions of\r\ndollars. Since then 228 acres were added in 1913 by the same\r\nbenefactor. Nor is account taken of the addition to the campus of\r\nthe Joseph property, the gift of Sir William Macdonald, at a cost\r\nof $142,500, nor of that other notable addition, forming indeed a\r\nnew campus of about twenty-five acres in extent (the Molson and\r\nLaw Properties), which Sir William conveyed to the University\r\nin 1911, having purchased it for this purpose for no less a sum\r\nthan one million dollars. This magnificent donation insures the\r\nfuture of the University, providing as it does for the greatest\r\npossible expansion. It is even now being converted into a site\r\nfor a gymnasium and a second campus.\r\n\r\nTo resume, in 1893 there were but five faculties; today,\r\nin reality, there are eight, a Faculty of Agriculture, a\r\nDepartment of Music, a Dental Department and a Graduate School\r\nhaving been established in the interval, whilst on the other\r\nhand, one--the Faculty of Comparative Medicine and Veterinary\r\nScience, established in 1889, as the result of the amalgamation\r\nof the Montreal Veterinary College, founded in 1866--has been\r\ndiscontinued since 1903, but it is likely to be resurrected in\r\nconnection with the Faculty of Agriculture at Macdonald College\r\nwithin a year or two. In 1893 the different Faculties were\r\nalmost separate entities, bound to the University by a slender\r\ncord, indeed. The Faculty of Medicine was almost an independent\r\ninstitution, so was the Faculty of Veterinary Science and to a\r\nless degree also the Faculty of Law.\r\n\r\nThe faculty of agriculture mentioned, at St. Anne de Bellevue,\r\ndates from 1907. The department of music, as conducted in the\r\nconservatorium of music, was established in 1904. The Graduate\r\nschool for advanced students was established in 1906. In 1907 a\r\ncourse in military science, a school of commerce, and several\r\nsummer schools were added, and several extension courses have\r\nbeen added, notably in political economy, commercial law and\r\naccountancy.\r\n\r\nThe Donalda movement for higher education of women, which,\r\nas stated, was promoted by Sir William Dawson, was furthered\r\nby the chancellor, Lord Strathcona, who made it possible to\r\nestablish, in 1884, courses leading to a degree, and to whose\r\nfurther generosity it was that the Royal Victoria College was\r\nopened in 1899, being founded and endowed by him at the cost of\r\n$1,000,000. His object was to establish an institution which\r\nshould afford the opportunity of residence and college life to\r\nwomen students of McGill University, working in accordance with\r\nthe system previously organized in a special course in arts, but\r\nunder greatly improved conditions. By his recent death McGill\r\nUniversity has lost a great patron.\r\n\r\nThere is no theological faculty as such, though four of\r\nthe leading Protestant denominations, the Presbyterian and\r\nCongregationalists on the one hand, and the Episcopalians and\r\nWesleyans on the other, are affiliated in the arts course. A\r\nfurther movement among these four bodies in cooperation within\r\nthe last year or two has resulted in a Union Theological College.\r\n\r\nMcGill University has a great influence on the life of the city.\r\nIts professors keep in touch with civic affairs. In consequence\r\nthe relations of town and gown are amicable. The merchants are\r\nproud of the city’s world-famous university and generally came\r\nforward to relieve it in its growing pains.\r\n\r\nThe following table of 1913 shows its growth:\r\n\r\n\r\n                M’GILL UNIVERSITY (FOUNDED 1821)\r\n\r\nChancellor--The Right Hon.

Ever since their foundation these Colleges have\r\ntaken advantage of the classes in the University for training\r\ntheir students in the Arts subjects required of candidates for\r\nthe Ministry, and the results have been so satisfactory as to\r\nencourage the idea of extending the sphere of cooperation.\r\n\r\nEarly in the year 1912 careful investigation was made by\r\nrepresentatives of the four Colleges into the requirements of\r\ntheir several Theological Curricula, with a view to ascertaining\r\nwhat subjects, if any, could be taken in common classes. As\r\nthe result of prolonged consideration and negotiations, it was\r\nunanimously agreed that a large portion of the work which had\r\nhitherto been done separately by each of the Colleges could be\r\ntaken profitably in joint classes, without prejudice to the\r\nprinciples of the Communions represented and with increased\r\nefficiency in the work.\r\n\r\nThe authorities of the four Colleges accordingly offered for\r\nthe Session 1912-1913 a series of Inter-Collegiate Lecture\r\nCourses, from which each College might select according to the\r\nrequirements of its own curriculum. The cooperative plan, which\r\nwas inaugurated in October, 1912, with lectures and addresses by\r\nthe Rt. Rev. Dr. Boyd Carpenter, formerly Bishop of Ripon, and\r\nDr. Robert E. Speer, of New York, has been abundantly justified\r\nby the results.\r\n\r\nDuring the second session of 1913-1914 an effort was made to\r\nobtain funds with which to carry on the work of cooperation.\r\nThis effort was met by a generous response on the part of those\r\nsympathetic with the scheme. More than five hundred thousand\r\ndollars has been subscribed. With part of this sum the Board\r\nof Governors purpose to erect a central building where all\r\ninter-collegiate lectures will be given and where a well-equipped\r\nlibrary will be available to all students in Theology.\r\n\r\nThe advantages of affiliation with a great institution of\r\nContinental reputation such as McGill University are obvious.\r\nIn the first place, a College is able to devote practically its\r\nwhole income to strictly theological work, thus assuring the\r\nefficiency and thoroughness of the course. Secondly, the immense\r\nresources and the high educational standard of a University\r\nsuch as McGill afford theological students a liberal education\r\nthat could hardly be looked for under other circumstances. In\r\nthe third place, the broadening influence of life in so large a\r\nUniversity world, and contact with men of such widely different\r\nviews, aims, and pursuits are of inestimable advantage to every\r\nstudent, and to none more than to the student in theology.\r\nAffiliation also gives the Colleges representation on the\r\nCorporation of McGill, and consequently a voice and influence in\r\nUniversity affairs.\r\n\r\nThe following Act of Incorporation was also secured from the\r\nProvincial Legislature:\r\n\r\nAn Act to incorporate “The Joint Board of the Theological\r\nColleges affiliated with McGill University.”\r\n\r\n  Whereas the voluntary association known as “The Joint Board of\r\n  the Theological Colleges affiliated with McGill University” and\r\n  “The Board of Cooperation of the Theological Colleges affiliated\r\n  with McGill University” have, by their petition, represented as\r\n  follows:\r\n\r\n  That the theological colleges affiliated with McGill University\r\n  have found it advantageous to cooperate for the training of\r\n  students for the Christian ministry, and have actually so\r\n  cooperated for some time with success; that in consequence,\r\n  considerable sums of money have been subscribed by friends of\r\n  the movement for the purpose of furnishing means and equipment;\r\n  that a temporary joint board of managers (to-wit the petitioners)\r\n  representing each of the colleges concerned, has been in\r\n  existence for some time, engaged in organizing the work of this\r\n  cooperation; said joint board being composed as follows:\r\n\r\n  The Reverend Principal Hill, D.D., Rev. Hugh Pedley, D.D.,\r\n  Charles Gurd, Esq., Alexander M. Murphy, Esq., William D.\r\n  Lighthall, Esq., K.C., Thomas B.

Principal John Scrimger.\r\n\r\n  Secretary: Rev. Professor D.J. Fraser.\r\n\r\n\r\n              THE CONGREGATIONAL COLLEGE OF CANADA.\r\n\r\nThe Congressional College of Canada dates its history from a\r\nclass of four students who studied under Rev. Adam Lillie, at\r\nDundas, Ontario, in 1839. Mr. Lillie was educated in Glasgow\r\nUniversity. He went to India under the London Missionary\r\nSociety, but the climate did not permit him to stay. Returning\r\nto Scotland, he was persuaded by Doctor Wilkes to come to Canada\r\nand organized the Church in Brantford. He soon removed to Dundas\r\nand began the instruction of young men for the ministry at the\r\nurgency of Rev. John Roaf, on behalf of the Colonial Missionary\r\nSociety. From the beginning until 1869, Adam Lillie was the\r\npresiding genius, with Doctor Wickson as his strong co-laborer.\r\nThus, Congregational Christians were the first Protestants in\r\nCanada to make regular provision for education of the ministry.\r\n\r\nIn 1840, this gathering of students was moved to Toronto, and\r\ncalled “The Congregational Academy.” This was an historic name,\r\ncoming from the time when “Dissenters,” in the seventeenth\r\ncentury in England, were under the ban and their ministers\r\nforbidden to come within five miles of any town, or to teach any\r\npublic or private school. But many of these men were eminent\r\nscholars who braved the harsh law, and taught youth. When the\r\ntimes of toleration came these groups grew into “academies.”\r\n\r\nIn 1842, a similar institution was opened in Montreal through\r\nthe pressure of Rev. Henry Wilkes, of Zion Church. Rev. J.J.\r\nCarruthers, of the universities of St. Andrews and Edinburgh,\r\nwas brought out to conduct the Theological, Biblical, and\r\nClassical courses. This was done with the sanction and help of\r\nthe Colonial Missionary Society. But funds fell short, and it was\r\ndecided in 1845 to unite the Montreal and Toronto Congregational\r\nInstitutions. This was done, and the name “Congregational\r\nTheological Institute” was chosen, and its control was changed\r\nfrom the Unions to the subscribers.\r\n\r\nIn 1848, a Congregational institution was opened in Liverpool,\r\nNova Scotia, the result of a bequest of Mr. James Gorham, and was\r\ncalled Gorham College. But the building was burned in 1854, and\r\nthe Maritime Churches were unable to maintain it more than three\r\nyears. Its good-will and its library were given to the Toronto\r\nInstitute. Another advantage accrued to the common cause by\r\nleading to the use of the name “College,” and making it possible\r\nto adopt the comprehensive title “Congregational College of\r\nBritish North America,” in 1860. And still greater was the fact\r\nthat Prof. George Cornish, who had come from English colleges\r\nto teach in the Gorham College, became professor of Greek in\r\nMcGill, and was ready to teach in this college if it should go to\r\nMontreal.\r\n\r\nIn Toronto the preparatory courses were taken with much\r\ndifficulty in King’s College. This was established in 1842, and\r\nwas under strong Anglican control perpetuating the old country\r\nattitude toward Free Churches. In 1849 this College became\r\nthe University of Toronto, with a broader foundation. But no\r\naffiliation was offered, and interest in the College was growing\r\nless with consequent decrease of funds.\r\n\r\nStronger supporters were coming forward in Montreal, affiliation\r\ncould be secured with McGill, Professor Cornish would be a great\r\nhelp, and church life in Montreal was vigorous and united. “The\r\nmovement for removal was prompted by western men and largely\r\ncarried by them. Montreal did not propose or vote for it,” says\r\nDoctor Marling. After the final discussion by the corporation\r\nof subscribers in Brantford in 1864, the vote for removal was\r\nunanimous.\r\n\r\nIn 1864, the session opened in the rooms of Zion Church, on\r\nBeaver Hall Hill, and the first Act of Incorporation was secured\r\nfrom the Dominion Parliament. Then, from 1880 to 1884, the\r\nlibrary and recitation rooms were in Emmanuel Church. On coming\r\nto Montreal the College was admitted to affiliation with McGill,\r\nthe first of the Theological Colleges to enjoy that privilege.\r\n\r\nA great loss was suffered in the death of Doctor Lillie in 1869.\r\nA memorial fund of $1,000 was raised, which was the nucleus of\r\nthe Endowment Fund. Doctor Wilkes was chosen Principal and gave\r\nhis great energy and business skill and his influence among the\r\nBritish churches to the College.\r\n\r\nIn 1884, certain friends, chiefly in Montreal, generously erected\r\nand presented to the College the building on McTavish Street,\r\nwhich it now occupies, together with the ground on which the\r\nPrincipal’s residence was afterward built. At that time an\r\namendment to the Act of Incorporation changed the name to “The\r\nCongregational College of Canada.”\r\n\r\nThe Colonial Missionary Society of England was a large factor\r\nin beginning the work of the College, and has stood by it in\r\nall times of distress with generous financial aid. It will ever\r\nremain first on the roll of the benefactors. Mr. and Mrs. S.H.C.\r\nMiner have been the largest donors to the Endowment Fund and to\r\ncurrent expenses. The Endowment Fund now stands at $110,000.\r\n\r\nThe Principals have been as follows:\r\n\r\nRev. Adam Lillie, D.D., 1839-69; Rev. Henry Wilkes, D.D., LL. D.,\r\n1870-83; Rev. John Frederick Stevenson, LL. B., D.D., 1883-86;\r\nRev. William M. Barbour, D.D., 1887-97; Rev. Joseph Henry George,\r\nPh. D., D.D., 1898-1901; Rev. Edward Munson Hill, M.A., D.D.,\r\n1901-.\r\n\r\nThe Professors and Lecturers have been:\r\n\r\nRev. J.J. Carruthers, D.D., 1842-45; Rev. Arthur Wickson, LL. D.,\r\n1850-62; Rev. Henry Wilkes, D.D., LL. D., 1841-86; Rev. George\r\nCornish, M.A., LL. D., 1864-91; Rev. Charles Chapman, M.A., LL.\r\nD., 1871-76; Rev. Archibald Duff, Jr., M.A., 1875-76; Rev. K.M.\r\nFenwick, 1872-84; Rev. J. F, Stevenson, LL. B., D.D., 1877-86;\r\nRev. Edward Munson Hill, M.A., 1883; Rev. John Burton, B.D.,\r\n1883-88; Rev. S.N. Jackson, M.D., 1884-93; Rev. W.H. Warriner,\r\nM.A., D.D., 1886; Rev. E.C. Evans, D.D., 1898-1900; Rev. D.S.\r\nHamilton, B.A., 1899-1901; Rev. Harlan Creelman, B.D., Ph. D.,\r\n1899-1908; Rev. Eugene W. Lyman, B.A., B.D., 1904-05; Rev.\r\nHerbert A. Youtz, B.D., Ph. D., 1905-08; Rev. E. Albert Cook, Ph.\r\nD., 1908-.\r\n\r\nThe office of Chairman of the Board was created in 1864, the\r\nincumbents of that office since that date having been:\r\n\r\nRev. Henry Wilkes, D.D., 1864-71; Rev. Charles Chapman, M.A.,\r\nLL. D., 1871-76; Rev. J.F. Stevenson, LL. B., D.D., 1876-83;\r\nGeorge Hague, Esq., 1883-91; Rev. George Cornish, M.A., LL.

John Roaf, 1839-55; Mr. Patrick Freeland, 1855-64; Mr. T.M.\r\nTaylor, 1864-66; Mr. J.P. Clarke, 1866-73; Mr. R.C. Jamieson,\r\n1873-88; Mr. C.R. Black, 1889-92; Mr. T. Moodie, 1892-.\r\n\r\nThe Secretaries have been:\r\n\r\nRev. T. Machin, 1841-45; Mr. R. Beekman, 1845-48; Rev. Edward\r\nEbbs, 1848-50, Joint Secretary, 1854-5, 1857-58; Mr. Patrick\r\nFreeland, 1850-55; Rev. F.H. Marling, 1855-64; Rev. George\r\nCornish, LL. D., 1864-91; Prof. W.H. Warriner, D.D., 1891-98;\r\nRev. E. Munson Hill, M.A., 1899-1902; Mr. A. McA. Murphy, 1903-.\r\n\r\n\r\n              MONTREAL DIOCESAN THEOLOGICAL COLLEGE\r\n\r\nThis College was founded in the year 1873, by the late Rt. Rev.\r\nAshton Oxenden, D.D., then Bishop of Montreal and Metropolitan\r\nof Canada. He makes the following reference to it in his\r\nautobiography:\r\n\r\n  “I, at length, felt justified in taking a step for the good\r\n  of my own Diocese. I decided on establishing a Theological\r\n  College in Montreal, for the training of our candidates for\r\n  Holy Orders. With this view, I procured from England, the aid\r\n  of a first-rate man, Mr. Lobley, a late Fellow of Trinity\r\n  College, Cambridge, who undertook the office of Principal. He\r\n  was a good and able man, and, in the face of many difficulties\r\n  which he fearlessly surmounted, he started the College, which\r\n  has now become a prominent and useful feature in the Diocese.\r\n  On his subsequent promotion to the Principalship of Bishop’s\r\n  College, Lennoxville, he was succeeded by Doctor Henderson, under\r\n  whose steady and unflagging superintendence the College still\r\n  flourishes.”--(Extract from “History of My Life,” 1891.)\r\n\r\nThe step was forced upon Bishop Oxenden by the rapid growth of\r\nthe Church in the Diocese, and the impossibility of securing\r\nin any other way a satisfactory supply of clergy to meet the\r\nincreasing needs of his Diocese.\r\n\r\nThe work of the College began in the Library of the Synod Hall,\r\nand was carried on there for eight years, when a more suitable\r\nbuilding was provided by the munificence of the late A.F. Gault,\r\nwho purchased the property, 896 Dorchester Street, now occupied\r\nby the Young Women’s Christian Association, at a cost of $23,000,\r\nand presented it to the College in trust.\r\n\r\nThere the work was continued under much more favorable\r\nconditions, as a permanent home was provided for both Principal\r\nand Students. Additional funds were raised which secured the\r\nappointment of a resident Tutor to assist the Principal, and\r\nprovided remuneration for different clergy of the city who\r\nlectured regularly in the College. Among the first lecturers were\r\nthe late Most Rev. W.B. Bond, Archbishop of Montreal; the late\r\nRt. Rev. James Carmichael, D.D., Coadjutor Bishop of Montreal;\r\nthe late Rt. Rev. E. Sullivan, D.D., formerly Bishop of Algoma,\r\nand afterwards Rector of St. James Cathedral, Toronto; the late\r\nRt. Rev. Maurice S. Baldwin, D.D., Bishop of Huron; Rt. Rev. J.P.\r\nDu Moulin, D.D., Bishop of Niagara.\r\n\r\nWhile its internal growth was thus satisfactory, the position of\r\nthe College as a Church institution was more clearly defined,\r\nand its relations with the educational world were extended. In\r\n1879, an act of incorporation was obtained from the Legislature\r\nof Quebec, and in 1880, it was affiliated with the University of\r\nMcGill College.\r\n\r\nIn 1891, by the Canon relating to Degrees in Divinity, the\r\nDiocesan Theological College, with the five other theological\r\ncolleges of this ecclesiastical province, was duly recognized by\r\nthe Provincial Synod of Canada, and entitled to representation on\r\nthe Board of Examiners for degrees in Divinity.\r\n\r\nIn 1895, owing to the increasing influence and needs of the\r\nCollege, the late A.F. Gault announced his intention of\r\npresenting a more suitable building and of adding to the\r\nendowment of the College. The “Holland” property on University\r\nStreet was purchased for that purpose, and a very handsome and\r\ncommodious building erected. The building, which is in the\r\ncollegiate gothic style, includes a semi-detached residence\r\nfor the Principal, a chapel with a seating capacity for fifty\r\nstudents, a convocation hall capable of holding 500 persons,\r\ncommodious lecture rooms, dining room, library, gymnasium and\r\naccommodation for about thirty-five resident students. The whole\r\nwas also magnificently furnished by the same generous donor, and\r\nthe sum of $50,000 was added to the endowment.\r\n\r\nThe buildings and additional endowment were formally handed over\r\nto the Bishop of the Diocese on the occasion of the opening\r\nof the College, on October 21, 1906, in the presence of His\r\nGrace the Primate of all Canada, and a number of other bishops,\r\nclergy, and visitors, and these were given in perpetuity without\r\nconditions of any kind in trust to the Bishop of Montreal and his\r\nsuccessors.\r\n\r\nWhile the College was originally founded for, and has always\r\nserved to supply the needs of the Diocese, which has a first\r\nclaim upon it, its name Diocesan is not to be interpreted in a\r\nstrictly local sense. The aim of the College is to furnish a\r\nsupply of capable men, primarily for the Diocese of Montreal,\r\nthen for the wider field of the whole Dominion, and in some\r\ndegree also for the boundless field beyond--the harvest field of\r\nthe world.\r\n\r\nThe present principal, the Rev. Elson I. Rexford, M.A., LL. D.,\r\nD.C.L., was appointed in 1903.\r\n\r\n\r\n               THE PRESBYTERIAN COLLEGE, MONTREAL\r\n\r\nThe Presbyterian College, Montreal, is an institution solely\r\nfor the training of ministers. Its establishment was authorized\r\nby the Synod of the Canada Presbyterian Church in 1864, at the\r\nrequest of a number of ministers and prominent laymen in the city\r\nof Montreal, with a special view to supplying the pressing needs\r\nof the congregations and missions in the valleys of the Ottawa\r\nand Lower St. Lawrence, for which it was found difficult to\r\nsecure a sufficiency of trained men. A charter of incorporation\r\nwas obtained in 1865, but work was actually begun only in\r\nOctober, 1867, when classes were opened in the Lecture Hall of\r\nErskine Church, under the instruction of the Rev. Wm. Gregg, of\r\nToronto, and of Rev. Wm. Aitken, of Smith’s Falls, as lecturers\r\nfor the session. In 1868 the Rev. D.H. MacVicar was appointed\r\nsole professor of Divinity. On the addition of other members to\r\nthe permanent staff, he was made Principal, and occupied this\r\nposition until his death in 1902. The Rev. Dr. Robert Campbell\r\nexercised the function till the appointment of the present\r\nprincipal, the Rev. John Scrimger, appointed in 1904.\r\n\r\nThe first building for the use of the College was erected in\r\n1873, on a site immediately adjoining the grounds of McGill\r\nUniversity. This building soon became insufficient, and in 1882\r\nit was greatly enlarged through the liberality of Mr. David\r\nMorrice, the Chairman of the Board of Management.\r\n\r\nThe College is controlled entirely by the Presbyterian Church in\r\nCanada, the General Assembly appointing its Board of Management\r\nand Senate each year, as well as filling all vacancies on the\r\nstaff. For educational purposes it is affiliated to McGill\r\nUniversity, and maintains the closest relations with that\r\ninstitution. The students receive practically all their literary\r\ntraining in the University classes.\r\n\r\n\r\n                THE WESLEYAN THEOLOGICAL COLLEGE\r\n\r\nThis institution was founded in the year 1872, by the Wesleyan\r\nMethodist Church of Canada, for the training of candidates for\r\nthe Ministry, and began its educational work, September 29,\r\n1873. In 1879, by direction of the General Conference of the\r\nMethodist Church of Canada, an act of Incorporation was obtained\r\nfrom the Legislature of the Province of Quebec, and the College\r\nwas affiliated to McGill University. At the Union, in 1883,\r\nof the several Methodist bodies in Canada, constituting “The\r\nMethodist Church,” it was recognized as having the same relation\r\nwhich it previously held as one of the Connexional Educational\r\nInstitutions of the Church. In 1887 the Charter was so amended\r\nby the Legislature of the Province of Quebec as to give to the\r\nInstitution the power to confer degrees in Divinity.\r\n\r\nThe present buildings, which were erected in 1914, on the site\r\nformerly occupied in part by the old building were formally\r\nopened on Saturday, October 3, 1914, and are situated on\r\nUniversity Street, near Mount Royal, at the eastern entrance to\r\nthe University grounds and accommodate about one hundred students.\r\n\r\nRev. George Douglas, D.D., LL. D., the first Principal, held\r\nthat position for twenty-one years, and the late Reverend Doctor\r\nShaw was connected with the Institution, first as Professor and\r\nafterwards as Principal, from its foundation till 1910.\r\n\r\nThe present Principal, Rev. James Smyth, B.A., LL. D., of\r\nBelfast, Ireland, was appointed in 1911.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               II\r\n\r\n                        LAVAL UNIVERSITY\r\n\r\nWhile the history of the University of McGill is largely\r\nthat of a small germinal University gradually developing the\r\npotentialities of its charter, that of the University of Laval\r\nat Montreal is one of a gradual evolution from the preexisting\r\nembryonic schools of arts, philosophy, theology, law and\r\nmedicine which arose in due course, as the higher education of\r\nCatholics, principally of the French Canadian population, became\r\ngradually organized. In due course all these elements, when well\r\nadvanced, were absorbed into the university proper when founded\r\nin 1876. Its story, therefore, involves the description of the\r\ncomponent parts of its constitution, and the first dates of\r\ninterest connected with the foundation of the predecessors are\r\nthose of the present “Montreal College.”\r\n\r\nThe “Collège de Montreal,” which would seem to be the logical\r\ncontinuation of the _écoles de Latin_ in existence up to the\r\ncapitulation, and had supplemented the _petits écoles_ started\r\nearly in 1657, after the arrival of the Sulpicians, was founded\r\nabout 1767 in the presbytery of the Curé of Longue Pointe by\r\nM.J. Baptiste Curatteau de Blaisérie, a Sulpician priest. He had\r\na decided taste for education and the direction of youth. To\r\nprovide the beginning of a classical education for pious citizens\r\nand for the needs of the future aspirants of the clergy he had\r\nadded an annex to his presbytery, and rapidly a small boarding\r\nschool arose which became known as the “_Petit Séminaire_” or\r\n“_Collège_.” He was assisted in his work by two ecclesiastical\r\nstudents, Mm. J.B. Dumouchel and J.B. Huet d’Alude.\r\n\r\nThe success attending this venture encouraged the citizens to\r\nestablish a regular college at Montreal similar to that at\r\nQuebec. Accordingly the church wardens of Notre Dame came to\r\nthe assistance of M. Curatteau to place him in charge of an\r\nestablishment at the Château Vaudreuil, the palace of the late\r\ngovernor general, then for sale, buying it, and thus, in 1773,\r\nthe College of St. Raphael was installed on October 1st. The\r\ncollege started with about fifty-two _pensionnaires_ and a like\r\nnumber of _externes_. The prize list of 1774, proclaimed in\r\nLatin, reveals six classes, the highest of which was called the\r\n“Schola Humanitatis.”\r\n\r\nThe memory prize of this class was awarded to Franciscus Papineau\r\nand Petrus Amabilis de Bonne de Missede, the future Judge of\r\nCommon Pleas (_Ex aequo_), while the first prize for French into\r\nLatin fell to F. Papineau and the second to Ludovicus Bonnet.\r\nIn 1789 at the term composition proclaimed in January we find\r\nthe highest class named Rhetoric, the first boy called the\r\n“Imperator” being Joannes Baptista Curot. Benjamin Dys Viger\r\ncomes second as “Cæsar,” and Ambrosius Sanguinet as “Consul.” In\r\nScholâ Tertia the Imperator is Jacobus Lartigue, the future first\r\nbishop of Montreal.\r\n\r\nM. Curatteau died in Montreal on February 11, 1790, at the age\r\nof sixty years. His will of January 29, 1774, leaves all his\r\nproperty to the college and should it fail, his estate should be\r\nrevertible, two-thirds to the General Hospital and a third to\r\nthe Hôtel Dieu. He was succeeded as principal in 1790 by M.J.B.\r\nMarchand, a priest, with seven other professors, of whom five\r\nwere ecclesiastics, one a layman and the seventh a priest. M.\r\nIgnace Leclerc, the professor of the philosophy class, started\r\nhis course this year. The terms about this time were for the\r\n“_pensionnaires_” £14-11-8, and for the externes one guinea for\r\nentrance and nothing more. The catalogue of students for 1790\r\nreveals there were about ninety scholars, the ages varying from\r\ntwenty-one, in Philosophy (although one there is twenty-nine)\r\nto eight, in the lowest class, with one of six years of age.\r\nThere do not appear many English names.[3] In the last class,\r\nhowever, there are some beginning to enter, viz., Jean O’Sullivan\r\n(aged nine years) and Nicholas Hamilton (aged eight years).\r\nIn the prize list of 1792 there is a “Patricius Smith” who\r\nreceives honourable mention for arithmetic. An English class\r\nfor French students was begun in 1789. This dual instruction was\r\nthen apparently developed in the colony. In later years it has\r\nsomewhat lapsed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LAVAL UNIVERSITY]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MONTREAL COLLEGE]\r\n\r\nThree years after its inauguration the Collége de St. Raphaël in\r\n1773 staged a tragedy in three acts, presented by its scholars.\r\nIt was printed in 1776, “Chez Fleury Mesplet et Ch. Berger,\r\nImprimeurs et Libraires” and was entitled “Jonathan et David, ou\r\nLe Triomphe de L’Amitié.” Declamations, little pieces, lyrical or\r\ntragical, formal compliments to the students or the professors\r\nused to take place at the end of the distribution of prizes or on\r\nthe _jour de fête_ of the principal.\r\n\r\nM. Montgolfier wrote on August 25, 1778, to Bishop Briand\r\nacquainting him that “His Excellency, Sir Frederick Haldimand,\r\nhad been present at the little tragedy of the Sacrifice of\r\nAbraham at the completion of the classes; at the end of the\r\ndistribution of prizes he has given much praise to this\r\nestablishment and, having learnt from me that this house has no\r\nfixed revenue he sent me next day a present of 100 guineas for\r\nthe college and at the same time, 50 guineas for the Hospital\r\nGeneral ‘for the work of the foundlings there.’”\r\n\r\nIn the great fire of 1803, the Collége of St. Raphaël was\r\ndestroyed in June 6th. It was rebuilt in 1804, at the expense of\r\nthe Seminary of St. Sulpice, on College Street, not far from the\r\n“little river” and was opened on October, 1804, under the name of\r\nthe “_Collège or the Petit Séminaire de Montréal_.” The seminary\r\nremained on College Street till it was transferred to a portion\r\nof the fine establishment of the Grand Seminary which was built\r\nbetween 1854-1857 by the Seminary at the old Mountain Fort or the\r\n“Fort des Messieurs,” being opened the 18th of January, 1862. The\r\nold college was rented to the British government for a barracks\r\nfor the soldiers who entered the city on December, 1861. The\r\nCollège de Montréal has remained on its present site ever since.\r\n\r\nThe school of theology was founded in 1825 by Mgr. Lartigue in\r\nhis Episcopal residence at St. James church on St. Denis Street.\r\nIn 1840 it was transferred, having about fifteen students, to the\r\nCollège de Montréal on College Street and took the name of the\r\n“_Grand Séminaire_.” In 1857 it was again transferred, to the\r\npresent site at the old “_Fort des Messieurs_,” the new building\r\nbeing commenced on September 8, 1854, and blessed on September 8,\r\n1857. The superiors of the Grand Séminaire since its foundation\r\nhave been:\r\n\r\nPierre Louis Billaudèle, 1840-1846; Joseph Alexandre Baile,\r\n1846-1866; Jean Baptiste Benoit Larue, 1866-1871; Jules Claude\r\nDelavigne, 1871-1872; Frederic Louis Colin, 1872-1881; Isaie\r\nMarie Charles Lecoq, 1881-1903; Ferdinand Louis Lelandais, 1903.\r\n\r\nThe Collège de Ste. Marie is the successor of the attempt made\r\nin 1694 to establish a classical college in Montreal. After the\r\nreturn of the Jesuits to Montreal on May 31, 1842, an early\r\ninvitation came from the citizens to commence a college. On\r\nAugust 20, 1846, land was bought at a very favourable price from\r\nM. John Donegani, but before the work was in hand the typhus\r\noutbreak intervened. It was not till September 20, 1848, that\r\nthe school was opened with thirteen pupils in two classes in a\r\ntemporary frame building still standing at the corner of St.\r\nAlexander and Dorchester streets. In May, 1850, the building of\r\nthe college was renewed and on July 31st the finished college was\r\nblessed by Bishop Bourget with the public chapel attached. The\r\nGésu was not built till 1864. The classes to be given were the\r\nusual classical course to be followed by a philosophical course.\r\n\r\nIn 1889 Loyola College was founded as an offshoot of the Collège\r\nSte. Marie, to conduct classical and philosophical courses in\r\nEnglish. Its first home was at the southeast corner of St.\r\nCatherine and Bleury streets. Fire compelled these premises to\r\nbe vacated and in 1898 it was transferred to 68 Drummond Street,\r\nhitherto known as Doctor Tucker’s School. In 1914 a large college\r\nat Notre Dame de Grace is being built to be the future home of\r\nthe Loyola college.\r\n\r\nThe next educational venture was the foundation of the Ecole de\r\nMédicine et de Chirurgie, founded in 1843 and incorporated in\r\nMarch, 1845.\r\n\r\nThis was followed by the foundation of a school of law on May 1,\r\n1851. It was named the Ecole de Droit and was conducted under the\r\ndeanship of the M. Maximilien Bibaud, LL. D., doctor in civil and\r\ncanon law, the classes being held at the Collège de Ste. Marie.\r\n\r\nIn 1876 the Seminary of Philosophy had become a separate body\r\nfrom the Grand Seminary of Theology, but into which the students\r\ngraduated after three years of scholastic philosophy. The\r\nsuperiors of the Seminaire de Philosophie have been:\r\n\r\nIsaie Marie Charles Lecoq, 1876-1880; Jules Claude Delavigne,\r\n1880-1900; Louis Marie Lepoupon, 1900.\r\n\r\nThese elements as chronologically stated were then ready to be\r\ncorrelated into a university as a branch of the Laval University\r\nalready established at Quebec since 1852. In 1876 in consequence\r\nof the petition of Mgr. Bourget, then bishop of Montreal, the\r\nSacred Congregation of Propaganda ordered its establishment at\r\nMontreal. It was recognized by the civil law of the province of\r\nQuebec in 1881.\r\n\r\nIn 1878 the schools of law and theology already described as\r\nexisting were inaugurated, to be followed in 1879 by that of\r\nmedicine also already organized. In 1887 the faculty of arts was\r\nadded.\r\n\r\nThe Apostolic Constitution “Jam dudum” of Leo XIII, of February\r\n2, 1889, obtained through M. Colin, the superior of the seminary\r\nof St. Sulpice, and Archbishop Fabre, gave the administrative\r\nbody at Montreal its practical autonomy under a vice rector,\r\nwhile still requiring its degrees to be conferred through the\r\ncouncil of the University of Laval at Quebec.\r\n\r\nThe inauguration of the university buildings on St. Denis Street\r\ntook place on October 8, 1895.\r\n\r\nThe main building of the university, which was largely raised\r\nthrough the generosity of the Sulpicians, who have always\r\npatronized forward movements in education, may be described as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\nThe style of architecture of the building is a modern\r\nadaptation of the Renaissance. It has been devised for the use\r\nof two faculties for the present, with room for the general\r\nadministration. The cellar contains, as is usual in such\r\nstructures, all the necessary appliances, and in the most\r\nrecent and approved styles, for steam-heating, electric and\r\ngas-lighting. The ground floor is occupied by lecture rooms,\r\nmuseums of anatomy and the library of the School of Comparative\r\nMedicine and Veterinary Science, and it has also large recreation\r\nand club rooms, a large and commodious reading room for students,\r\nand the janitor’s quarters. The first floor is devoted to the\r\nLaw Faculty, the reception parlors, the rector’s apartments, and\r\na suite of study rooms for the professors. There are on this\r\nfloor two amphitheatres, with a capacity of two hundred to three\r\nhundred seats respectively, for the use of the Law Faculty. The\r\nPeristyle, which is an imposing feature of the exterior, leads\r\nto this story. The second floor is entirely occupied by the\r\nFaculty of Medicine, and contains a general professor’s parlour,\r\nlaboratories and lecture rooms, also a library, and quarters\r\nfor the treasurer and secretary of the Faculty. The finest\r\nrooms are perhaps a large laboratory of histology, perfectly\r\nlighted, and provided with modern apparatus for the practical\r\nteaching of normal and morbid histology. The amphitheatre of\r\nthe primary course, can accommodate 300 students. It can be put\r\ninto direct connection with the laboratory of chemistry. The\r\namphitheatre for the final course accommodates 400 students.\r\nThe Promotion Hall (third story) has a seating capacity of\r\nnearly two thousand and has been much used of late for public\r\nlectures. It is profusely lighted by electricity, and the day\r\nlight is also abundant. Its acoustic and visual qualities are\r\nperfect. The proscenium is so constructed that it can be used\r\nfor concerts and other spectacular performances by the students.\r\nSix large rooms, averaging 35 × 50 feet, are reserved for\r\nmuseums and for collections of documents. The amphitheatre of\r\nanatomy, accommodating 300 students, is in the last story and\r\nin connection with the dissecting room, which is very spacious.\r\nThe disposal of the rooms, stairways, elevator, lavatories, and,\r\nother necessary conveniences is very good, and there is not a\r\nsingle room in the whole building which is not well-lighted. The\r\narchitecture of the interior is very simple, but quite effective,\r\nespecially that of the Promotion Hall.\r\n\r\nThere are affiliated with it several colleges and schools: the\r\nEcole Polytechnique, l’Ecole de Medicine, Comparee et de Science\r\nvétérinaire de Montreal, l’Ecole de Chirurgie Dentaire, l’Ecole\r\nde Pharmacie Laval, l’Institut Agricole d’Oka, l’Institut des\r\nFrères Maristes et l’Institut des Frères de l’Instruction\r\nChrétienne, l’Institut des Frères de Sainte-Croix, the arts and\r\nphilosophical courses at St. Marys, Loyola and other classical\r\ncolleges and seminaries, as well as the College of Higher\r\nEducation for Young Women, conducted in French and English at the\r\nMother House of the Congregation on Sherbrooke Street.\r\n\r\nThe faculty of theology is constituted by the Grand Seminary\r\nwhich was established in 1840. Its courses last for three years\r\nand three months with a further six months for those preparing\r\nfor the doctorate. A great number of the students who come from\r\nall quarters to this faculty, after having taken their courses\r\nat Montreal proceed to Rome to the now famous Canadian College,\r\nwhich is an offshoot of the Grand Seminaire of Montreal, being\r\nfounded in 1888 through the labours of M. Colin, who was superior\r\nof the Sulpicians at Montreal from 1881 to 1902. In connection\r\nwith this latter faculty may be mentioned the Seminary of\r\nPhilosophy which has been a separate body since 1876.\r\n\r\nWhile the medical faculty of McGill saved the fortunes of that\r\nuniversity from extinction, it is to the credit of the pioneers\r\nof the medical faculty of the Montreal branch of Laval University\r\nthat the university movement received its inception. Before its\r\nestablishment a body of the medical men who had retired from\r\ntheir connection with the medical faculty of the University of\r\nCoburg agitated for the foundation of an independent university\r\nin the city. Among these were Dr. Rottot, Brosseau, La Marche\r\nand E. Persillier-Lachapelle, who acted as the secretary. On\r\napproaching the gentlemen of the seminary it was pointed out\r\nthat it would be unwise and also against prearranged conditions\r\nto establish a rival university to that of Laval at Quebec, but\r\nthat a branch was possible. This solved the difficulty and the\r\nnecessary steps were taken. The first medical faculty of Laval\r\nat Montreal, soon to be formed, was composed of Dr. Rottot as\r\ndean, with Drs. E. Persillier-Lachapelle, La Marche, Brosseau,\r\nDesrosiers, Berthelot, Fafard, Filiatrault, Duval, Foucher,\r\nBienvenu and others.\r\n\r\nAmong the first members of the faculty of law was Mr. C.S.\r\nCherrier, Hon. J.P.O. Chauveau, Sir Louis Jetté, Sir Alexander\r\nLacoste, Judge Alphonse Ouimet and Sir H. Archambault.\r\n\r\nThe dean of the faculty of Science and Belles Lettres was the\r\nAbbé Colin.\r\n\r\nThe faculty of medicine is a continuation of the L’Ecole de\r\nMedicine et de Chirurgie de Montreal (the Alma Mater of our older\r\nMontreal physicians) founded in 1843 and incorporated in 1845,\r\naffiliated at first to the Victoria University of Coburg, in\r\nOntario, and from which it received its degrees up to 1890. At\r\nthis time the above medical school received a modified charter\r\nfrom the government of Quebec and was allied to the faculty of\r\nmedicine of the University of Laval, with which it forms today\r\none body.\r\n\r\nThe faculty of Medicine is installed with that of Law in the main\r\nbuilding on St. Denis Street. There are large lecture halls and\r\nsectional libraries. The Faculty of Medicine has an addition,\r\na dissecting hall and laboratories for chemistry, histology,\r\nbacteriology, therapeutical electricity, etc.\r\n\r\nThe faculty of arts has not yet reached its fullest development.\r\nAs scientific and literary instruction which form the ordinary\r\ncourses of this faculty in English universities is carried out by\r\nthe classical colleges and petit seminaires, affiliated to Laval\r\nUniversity, in which students may obtain the degrees of Bachelor\r\nof Letters, of science and of arts, it is unnecessary for the\r\nuniversity itself to undertake full instruction of this nature.\r\n\r\nThree courses are, however, given in the faculty. The first,\r\nthat of French literature, founded in 1898 by the late M. l’Abbé\r\nColin, superior of the seminary of St. Sulpice, in Montreal, is\r\nentrusted to a Fellow of the University of Paris. The second\r\ncourse is upon public ecclesiastical law and the third is upon\r\naesthetics and the history of art. The other professors, whether\r\necclesiastics or laymen, of the faculty of arts, conduct the\r\nregular courses in the colleges affiliated with the university,\r\nin addition to which they occasionally give public lectures in\r\nthe university itself. The library of the faculty contributes\r\ngenerously to the intellectual development of the students and\r\nthe public in general. Large annual expenditures secure for it\r\nthe best current publications. The higher education of women is\r\nencouraged by this faculty through the “Ecole d’Enseignement\r\nSupérieur pourlles Jeunes Filles” which has its courses in the\r\nhandsome college on Sherbrooke Street in the Mother House of the\r\nCongregation of Notre Dame, founded by Marguerite Bourgeoys, the\r\nfirst teacher in Montreal. It was opened on October 8, 1908,\r\nunder the presidency of the vice rector of Laval University.\r\nThe following sections are taught in French and in English\r\nby university professors and the ladies of the Congregation:\r\nletters, science, arts, commerce and domestic economy. These lead\r\nup to a degree in the faculty of arts. Already this school for\r\nthe higher education of women has shown very substantial results.\r\n\r\nAnother arm of the faculty of arts has been established in\r\ncertain congregations of brothers where a university course has\r\nbeen organized modeled on the French system of modern secondary\r\neducation. The Marist Brothers were the first congregation\r\naffiliated on December 15, 1909, being followed later by the\r\nBrothers of Christian Instruction of Montreal and the Brothers\r\nof the Cross of Jesus of the diocese of Rimouski. In 1912, the\r\nsame privilege was granted to the Brothers of Holy-Cross.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SCHOOLS AFFILIATED WITH LAVAL UNIVERSITY: School\r\nof Dentistry]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SCHOOLS AFFILIATED WITH LAVAL UNIVERSITY:\r\nAgricultural School at Oka]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SCHOOLS AFFILIATED WITH LAVAL UNIVERSITY:\r\nPolytechnic School]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SCHOOLS AFFILIATED WITH LAVAL UNIVERSITY: School\r\nof Theology]\r\n\r\nThe school of Dental Surgery, which is a continuation of the\r\nFrench section of the Dentistry College of the province of\r\nQuebec, founded in 1894, was affiliated to the university of\r\nLaval in February, 1904, and obtained its civil status from\r\nthe legislature in May of the same year. This school, which is\r\nintended primarily for young French Canadians, was rendered\r\nnecessary by the rapid progress which has been made latterly in\r\ndental surgery. It started relying solely on its own resources\r\nand upon the devotion of its professors. It has grown rapidly and\r\nits courses annually attract a certain number of students from\r\nEurope. Instruction covers a period of four years and leads to\r\nthe degree of Doctor of Dental Surgery. The theoretical courses,\r\nclinics and demonstrations are given in the spacious buildings\r\nopened on St. Hubert Street in 1913. In it are also magnificent\r\noperating rooms with dental chairs and thoroughly equipped\r\nlaboratories. The infirmary in the same building is open every\r\nday from 9 A.M. till noon, and in it those who cannot afford to\r\npay the full fee are treated by competent practitioners at rates\r\nmerely sufficient to reimburse the institution for the cost of\r\nmaterial supplied.\r\n\r\nThe Laval School of Pharmacy, incorporated by a special act\r\nof the legislature of Quebec, adopted on March 9, 1906, was\r\naffiliated to the university in the same year, on May 11th.\r\nIt aims to give instruction in and to promote all branches\r\nof pharmaceutical science. The school is entitled to grant\r\nuniversity degrees. The courses are given in the university\r\nbuildings and last from the beginning of October to the\r\nbeginning of April. What corresponds in American universities\r\nto the faculty of applied science is conducted by the “Ecole\r\nPolytechnique” which was founded in 1874. A department of\r\narchitecture was added in 1908. This school has been annexed\r\nto the faculty of arts since 1887. It has been generously\r\nsubsidized by the provincial government and the principal\r\nrailway companies. It prepares students for the several branches\r\nof civil and industrial engineering, such as public roads,\r\nrailways, mechanical and mining engineering, bridge-building\r\nand metal construction. The Polytechnic is housed on St. Denis\r\nStreet in large buildings suited to its special needs, in which\r\nan equipment admirably adapted to scientific training, both\r\ntheoretical and practical, places it in the front rank of similar\r\ninstitutions.\r\n\r\nThe School of Comparative Medicine and Veterinary Science which\r\nwas installed in 1913 in a handsome building on De Montigny\r\nStreet has existed since 1886. Although affiliated with the\r\nuniversity it is under the control and subject to the inspection\r\nof the minister of agriculture of the Quebec government, from\r\nwhich it receives a subsidy. The courses extend over three years\r\nand lead to a doctorate. It includes numerous clinics, which are\r\nheld at the infirmary of the school. The school possesses fine\r\nlecture rooms, an interesting pathological museum, a laboratory\r\nof bacteriology, a laboratory of chemistry and other departments.\r\nThe number of students who are almost all from the province of\r\nQuebec is as yet small, but it is increasing inasmuch as farmers\r\nare beginning to understand the value of the services which well\r\ntrained veterinary surgeons can render them.\r\n\r\nThe science of agriculture is provided by the university through\r\nthe Agricultural Institute at Oka, which was affiliated to Laval\r\nUniversity on March 26, 1908. It had, however, been in existence\r\nfor several years, its regular activities dating from March 8,\r\n1893, when it was opened by the Trappist Fathers of Notre Dame\r\ndu Lac at the request, and with the liberal support, of the\r\nprovincial government. Under the more modest name of the School\r\nof Agriculture it had been increasingly successful until, during\r\nthe winter of 1907, it was completely reorganized, its equipment\r\nwas modernized and improved and its courses of study extended.\r\nIn addition to a preparatory course lasting for one year the\r\nInstitute offers a three-years’ course leading to academic\r\ndegrees. Special instruction, which includes several partial\r\ncourses, has also been arranged for in favour of persons who are\r\nprevented from taking the full regular courses. The Institute\r\nis liberally provided with books, museums and laboratories. The\r\ngrounds cover an area of 1,800 acres and are situated about\r\nthirty miles from Montreal on the Lake of the Two Mountains.\r\n\r\nAll the faculties and schools above mentioned enjoy great\r\nliberty of initiative and action in everything which concerns\r\ntheir regular internal regulations and their courses of study.\r\nThe archibishop of Montreal in his quality as vice-chancellor,\r\ncontrols the appointment and removal of professors and exercises\r\ngeneral supervision in matters of doctrine and discipline. He\r\nis ex-officio president of the administrative board, which\r\nholds the university properties and directs its finances. The\r\nsuffragan bishops of the ecclesiastical province of Montreal,\r\nrepresentatives and affiliated seminaries of the same province,\r\nrepresentatives of faculties and of graduates, also have a seat\r\nin this body, which, as a general rule, acts through the board of\r\ngovernors, composed of eminent financiers and professional men. A\r\nvice rector, chosen by the bishops of the province of Montreal,\r\nrepresents the university’s council, the administrative board\r\nand the board of governors in matters of discipline and general\r\nadministration.

THE LIBRARY MOVEMENT\r\n\r\nIn 1773 the Sulpicians of Montréal opened the Collège de St.\r\nRaphael to teach the youth of the city, and its curriculum made\r\na feature of Belles Lettres. From those graduating from this\r\nschool sprang the societies and the great library associated with\r\nthe name of the Seminary of St. Sulpice. There had been small\r\nlibraries here and there but this first great French library was\r\nformed in July, 1844, by the two congregations or sodalities\r\nof men and women attached to Notre Dame parish, offering their\r\nlibraries, one of 600 and the other of 700 volumes, to form the\r\nnucleus of a larger library. This was supplemented by 800 books\r\nfrom the Séminaire St. Sulpice and some good books from other\r\nsources, making a total of 2,200. The new library was called\r\n“L’Oeuvre des bons livres de Ville-Marie” and was conducted\r\nalong the same lines as, and affiliated with, the famous library\r\nat Bordeaux, France, which had been started about twenty years\r\nbefore. This library was formally opened in September, 1845,\r\nby M. Bourget, bishop of Montreal, when 200 more volumes were\r\nadded. The books were first housed in a building on Place d’Armes\r\nbelonging to the seminary, then afterwards in a building on\r\nSt. Sulpice Street loaned by the Hôtel Dieu Nuns and thence,\r\nin 1860, it was moved to a house at 197 Notre Dame Street, the\r\nbuilding being that of the Cabinet de Lecture paroissial, then\r\ncompleted and finally to its present home recently erected as the\r\nBibliotheque St. Sulpice at 340 Denis Street.\r\n\r\nEarly after the housing of the Cabinet de Lecture in 1860 a\r\nlecture bureau was incorporated in connection with the library\r\nand under the direction of the superior of the seminary. This\r\nbureau published the principal papers in a monthly journal.\r\n\r\nThe first mention of an English library was in 1796 when the\r\n“Montreal Library” was incorporated as a joint stock association\r\nof 120 shares at $50 per share. The library had no permanent home\r\nuntil 1821 when the upper part of the old Wesleyan Chapel on\r\nSt. Sulpice Street was taken, where for the next sixteen years\r\nit served the English speaking population. In 1837 new quarters\r\nwere found in the Natural History Society, then on Little St.\r\nJames Street. In 1844 the Montreal Library was purchased by the\r\nMercantile Library Association which had been established three\r\nyears earlier by a number of merchants, the number of books of\r\nthe amalgamated library at this date being about 4,000. For many\r\nyears the Mercantile Association, at its headquarters at the\r\ncorner of Bonaventure and St. Joseph streets, was the meeting\r\nplace of the élite of the city. With new associations and clubs\r\ncoming into existence the popularity of the Mercantile waned\r\nuntil the library was handed over to the Fraser Institute,\r\nincorporated in 1870 by the Hon. J.J.C. Abbott, F.W. Torrance,\r\nT. Workman, A. Molson and P. Redpath, which is the only public\r\nlibrary, besides the small Civic Library, in Montreal, with its\r\nvaluable Gagnon collection of Canadiana. Both libraries are very\r\npopular and considering their limitations are doing useful work.\r\nIn addition might be mentioned the other valuable libraries\r\nfrequented by scholars and students, such as the Redpath\r\nLibrary, built and given by Mr. Peter Redpath in 1893 to McGill\r\nUniversity, the library belonging to Laval University, the Ecole\r\nNormale, the Bibliotheque St. Sulpice, under the auspices of\r\nthe Sulpicians, and the semi-public collections attached to the\r\nmany churches, colleges, schools and institutions, literary and\r\nsocial, scattered throughout the city and suburban municipalities\r\nsuch as the model one at Westmount.\r\n\r\nThere are some public libraries in the adjoining municipalities,\r\nthat at Westmount being a model one.\r\n\r\nThus Montreal is not so badly off in regard to the number of its\r\nbooks, even in comparison to its large population. But what is\r\ncertainly wanted in some centralizing system by which they can\r\nbe utilized through the cataloguing, interchange and circulation\r\nof the volumes. The city council is contemplating building a\r\nlarge central building to house many of the smaller libraries,\r\nwhich will again popularize the reading of good literature by\r\nthe masses, which for some time has fallen into disuse. But the\r\nfirst step to be taken should be the harmonizing, if possible, of\r\nthe existing library systems in the city through an intellectual\r\ncentral library organization bureau being formed. Such is more\r\nimmediately needed then a central library building to house books.\r\n\r\nThe early history of the Fraser Library is one of litigation.\r\nMr. Hugh Fraser, an unmarried man, but with several brothers and\r\nsisters, about six months before his death, in 1870, conceived\r\nthe idea of an institute in the interests of literature, science\r\nand art,--“of a free public library, museum and gallery to be\r\nopen to all honest and respectable persons whomsoever, of every\r\nrank in life without distinction and without fee or reward of any\r\nkind.”\r\n\r\nHis will, dated April 23, 1870, after making bequests to the\r\namount of $20,000 to his relatives and settling an annuity\r\nof £5,000 on a brother for the life of himself and his wife,\r\nbequeathed the bulk of his property to establish in Montreal the\r\n“Fraser Institute.” He named as his trustees the Hon. J.J.C.\r\nAbbott and Judge Torrance and authorized these to procure an act\r\nof incorporation to carry out his ideas. On May 15, 1870, he\r\ndied. The executors immediately took possession of the estate and\r\ncommenced the administration.\r\n\r\nBut on June 15th the heirs commenced an action to set aside the\r\nbequest as contrary to the laws of mortmain--which finally was\r\ncarried to the privy council in England, who rendered their\r\ndecision on the validity of the bequest on November 26, 1874.\r\nArrangements were then made to carry out the intentions of the\r\ndonor, but in 1875 an attempt was made by a bill in the Quebec\r\nLegislature to be allowed to bring the action up again, on the\r\nground that the privy council had erred in the interpretation of\r\nthe law. This failing, a second attempt was made on January 5,\r\n1876, on the ground that the testator of the will was _non compos\r\nmentis_ at the time of execution. This also failed. Until 1883\r\nfurther litigations embarrassing to the governors were carried\r\non, when at last they were able to take some steps.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, in 1882, the property lately used as the high school\r\nwas offered for sale by the school commissioners. This was a\r\ndesirable opportunity for establishing the Fraser Institute\r\nby way of a free library and the Hon. J.J.C. Abbott bought\r\nthe property for $30,000. Arrangements for taking over and\r\nshelving two libraries of about 15,000 volumes, the Mercantile\r\nLibrary Association and the Institut Canadien, were made through\r\nMessrs. Frederick Mathews, Theodore Lyman and Joseph Doutre\r\nand there were added valuable engravings from France, the gift\r\nof Prince Jerome Bonaparte. It was hoped to include as part\r\nof the institute the museum of the Natural History Society.\r\nThe Free Library, then a novelty in Canada, was opened to the\r\npublic on October 5, 1885, when the Honorable Mr. Abbott, as\r\ntrustee, explained the long delay, owing to the above mentioned\r\nlitigations. Among the other speakers hailing the new movement\r\nwere: the Honorable Mr. Justice Torrance, Mr. Thomas Workman,\r\nSir William Dawson, Mr. Justice Jetté, Mr. Justice Mathieu, Mr.\r\nHugh McLennan, Mr. Justice Mackay, Principal McVicar, Reverend\r\nMr. Larose, a former director of the Institut Canadien, Professor\r\nCoussirat, Mr. Henry Lyman and Lieutenant-Colonel Lyman, as a\r\nmember of the Mercantile Library. The mayor, M. Henri Beaugrand,\r\nhimself a littérateur, fitly declared the library open to the\r\npublic.\r\n\r\nAs a library the Fraser Institute has fulfilled a popular\r\nservice. It has a very valuable collection of French books, in\r\naddition to the original nucleus of the French library, and\r\nhas rare volumes of English, French, Latin, etc. It has also\r\na very valuable collection of “Canadiana.” The library made\r\ngreat progress during the presidency of Mr. McLennan, which has\r\ncontinued during that of Mr. Joseph Rielle. Up to 1901 it had\r\nincreased from 40,000 to 70,000 volumes. The first librarian was\r\nMr. Boodle, and since 1901 Mr. P.B. de Crèvecoeur has served in\r\nthat capacity.\r\n\r\nThe Fraser Free Library during its long and useful career has not\r\nyet realized the desire of the founder and the first governors\r\nto become also a “museum and gallery, to be open to all honest\r\nand respectable persons.” Certainly such is needed in the city\r\nnow. The future of the institute if it follows out its original\r\nintention, is still before it, with the help of a generous public.\r\n\r\n\r\n               II. LITERARY AND LEARNED SOCIETIES\r\n\r\nOne of the earliest learned societies is the Natural History\r\nSociety which was founded in 1827 and the difficulty of its\r\nfounders in bringing it about is best shown in the following\r\nextract taken from the first annual report, 1828:\r\n\r\n  “It is now only twelve months since a few gentlemen, who\r\n  casually, met together, proposed the establishment of this\r\n  society. They were not unaware of the difficulties they would\r\n  have to encounter. In all communities such as this where wealth\r\n  is comparatively little, where no opulent endowments take off\r\n  the necessity of attention to securing a livelihood, and where\r\n  as a consequence, the attention is directed into other channels,\r\n  very different from those of scientific research, not many can\r\n  be expected to join in assisting this society by their personal\r\n  exertions, however pleased they might be to see it arise.\r\n\r\n  “Anticipating therefore, but a small list of members, and where\r\n  also that at different times associations have been founded\r\n  for literary purposes, which have gradually been dissolved,\r\n  the founders of this society saw the necessity of a bond of\r\n  union, independent of this personal characteristic of the\r\n  first members. As a visible sign of the existence and utility\r\n  of the institution, and around which the members might at all\r\n  times rally, with a view there to afford this bond, to prevent\r\n  this tendency to devolution, the proposers of this Natural\r\n  History Society resolved to found a museum, an institution\r\n  which experience has proved to have great power in calling\r\n  the attention to scientific pursuits and the wants of which\r\n  was firstly felt by several members, who looked back upon the\r\n  various causes which in their younger days retarded their own\r\n  improvement. But the new collections of the productions of nature\r\n  would leave the design of the society imperfect without the\r\n  possession of books, that treat of such subjects. One without the\r\n  other would leave the work half done, but both connected give the\r\n  greatest facilities for instruction which can be afforded. In\r\n  addition therefore to the possession of a museum, it was one of\r\n  the first objects of the society to secure a library of books on\r\n  science in general. On these principles and with these views the\r\n  Natural History Society was founded.”\r\n\r\nThis body holds a bequest, though slight, for providing\r\nannually a lecture course for the public. It is known as the\r\nSomerville Foundation. This unique distinction is credited to the\r\nassociation, but it is also a sad commentary on the dearth of\r\nprovision for the general education of the public.\r\n\r\nThe institution is still with us and after having fulfilled a\r\nvaluable and no mean role in the past, may rise to the larger\r\ndemands and opportunities that the larger city which, at present,\r\nstill has no other museum of its kind, now offers to it to embark\r\non a larger venture than of old.\r\n\r\nOne of the earliest and more important factors in the\r\nintellectual life of the city and in the creation of a real\r\nlove for the best in the existence of the working man has been\r\nthe Mechanic’s Institute which was founded in November, 1828,\r\nby a body of earnest men, who felt that the worker should have\r\na chance to educate himself not only in science, but in art\r\nand literature. The first meetings were held in the house of\r\nthe Reverend Mr. Esson, who with Judge Gugy, L.J. Papineau and\r\nJohn Molson formed the executive. In its early years, not much\r\nprogress was made, but on its incorporation in 1845 new life was\r\nput into the work. Seven years afterwards land was secured on St.\r\nJames Street for a permanent building which was opened in 1855.\r\nIn 1862 the building was enlarged by the addition of a large hall\r\nto hold 800 people. For twenty-five years the institute was the\r\nprincipal hall for meetings until the city spread more north when\r\nit was divided into offices. Today its reading room and library\r\nare but very little used in comparison with the past.\r\n\r\nIn 1857 the Hon. P.J.O. Chauneau, LL. D., the provincial minister\r\nof public works, who took a keen interest in educational affairs,\r\nfounded the “Conferences des Instituteurs de L’Ecole Normale\r\nJacques-Cartier,” and in October of the same year a literary\r\nsociety, under the patronage of the Séminaire St. Sulpice was\r\nfounded under the title of “Cercle Littéraire” by Joseph Royal.\r\n\r\nLa Société Historique de Montreal, was founded in 1857, but was\r\nnot definitely organized until 1858, under the presidency of\r\nCommander Jacques Viger, being incorporated by an act of the\r\nLegislature in 1859. The headquarters of this society had always\r\nbeen held in the Ecole Normale Jacques Cartier. This society has\r\npublished important _memoires_ relative to the history of Canada,\r\nand possesses valuable manuscripts which for want of funds it is\r\nunable at present to publish. It was on its initiative that in\r\n1894 the monolith near Place Royale, formerly Pointe a Callières\r\nwas erected to commemorate the precise spot of the landing of the\r\nfirst colonists in 1642. Its presidents have been as follows:\r\nCommander Jacques Viger, April 11, 1858; M. L’Abbe H.A. Verreau,\r\nJanuary 14, 1859; M. Judge George Baby, May 18, 1904; M. Judge\r\nL.W. Sicotte, January 23, 1909; M. L’Abbe N. Dubois, May 6, 1912.\r\n\r\nOn May 3, 1858, the Institut Canadien-Francais came into\r\nexistence, having as secretary L.O. David, now Senator David,\r\nhistorian and litterateur. The society which had its home on\r\nLittle St. James Street was very active and many of its members\r\noccupied in after life responsible public positions. It began\r\nwell with bright, eager students, but finally fell on evil days\r\nwhen owing to a tendency to liberalism it came under the ban of\r\nBishop Bourget so that many of its members left and formed the\r\nSocieté des Artisans Français-Canadiens and the Union Nationale.\r\nAbout the same time two others were formed, active literary\r\nbodies of today, the Cercle Littéraire de Ville Marie (1857)\r\nunder the auspices of the Sulpicians, and the Union Catholique\r\n(1858) under the auspices of the Jesuits.\r\n\r\nThe Institut Canadien Library, which afterwards was held by the\r\nClub Canadien in trust, was finally transferred by arrangement to\r\nthe Fraser Institute in 1885.\r\n\r\nThe suppression of the Institut Canadien is remembered by the\r\nGuibord case. M. Guibord, one of the condemned members, though\r\nnot mentioned by name, after his death was refused burial in the\r\nCatholic cemetery, although he had owned a burial plot there.\r\nAn action which finally was taken to the privy council by his\r\nwidow was settled in her favour and the body was transferred\r\nfrom the Mount Royal Protestant Cemetery to that of Cote des\r\nNeiges. Fearing an _émeute_ the police and military were present,\r\nbut owing to the discretion of the mayor, Dr. William Hingston,\r\nnothing serious happened. A large boulder, unnamed, marks the\r\nspot of burial. Later the ground was deconsecrated and the\r\nwording of the law was changed so that burial in the Catholic\r\ncemetery may not take place, even with the prior possession of\r\nland, without the consent of the Catholic authorities.\r\n\r\nThe name of the Antiquarian and Numismatic Society is closely\r\nassociated with the old Château de Ramezay, for it was through\r\nthe initiative, beginning in 1894, of its members that the\r\nChâteau became, in 1897, its museum and consequently was saved\r\nfrom the hand of the vandal. The society was, however, first\r\nformed in 1862 by the juncture of two little groups, one French\r\nand one English, of numismatists who used to meet at the members’\r\nhomes to study the finds and histories of old coins and medals.\r\nRecognizing that the study of numismatics was largely connected\r\nwith the broader subject of antiquities, it was decided to change\r\nthe name of the society to the “Numismatic and Antiquarian\r\nSociety of Montreal.” In 1912 a new charter under the title of\r\n“The Antiquarian and Numismatic Society of Montreal” was granted.\r\nSome of the earliest members were A.J. Boucher, Stanley Bagg,\r\nJames Ferrier, L.A. Huguet-Latour, James Rattray, Dr. Hector\r\nPelletier, Daniel Rose, J.E. Guilbault, Lavens Mathewson, J.L.\r\nBronsdon, and since the society has included amongst its members\r\na number of historical authorities of distinction, such as\r\nWilliam Kingsford, William McLennan, Alfred Sandham, Dr. Samuel\r\nDawson, Gerald Hart, Judge Baby, Sir James Lemoine, Henry Mott,\r\nHon. P.J.O. Chauveau, M. l’Abbé Verreau, Judge L.W. Sicotte,\r\nSenator Edward Murphy, P.S. Murphy, I.B. Learmont, H.H. Lyman,\r\nHenry J. Tiffin, and M. l’Abbé N. Dubois; and such numismatic\r\nor antiquarian authorities as E.Z. Massicotte, P.O. Tremblay,\r\nR.W. McLachlan and W.D. Lighthall. The society, through its\r\njournal “The Canadian Antiquarian and Numismatic Journal,” which\r\nwas first published in 1872 and which, notwithstanding several\r\ninterruptions, has now reached its twenty-seventh volume, has\r\ngathered together and conserved for future generations invaluable\r\nrecords of Canadian history, while in its museum at the Château\r\nde Ramezay it has a collection of old portraits, antiquities,\r\ndocuments and books vying, according to Mr. J. Ross Robertson,\r\nwith the richest of its kind on the continent of America. Amongst\r\nthe contributors to its journal might be noted, in addition to\r\nthose mentioned, such authorities as Henry Mott, Samuel Baylis,\r\nits present editor, Lapalice, Victor Morin, Thomas O’Leary, and\r\nothers. Two very active members of the society have been De Léry\r\nMacdonald, whose extensive acquaintance with French-Canadian\r\nportraits and genealogy gave him the idea of the portrait gallery\r\nwhich is now part of the society’s collection, and Roswell Corse\r\nLyman, who did so much in the saving of the Château. The present\r\npresident, to whom is due the idea of the Château becoming the\r\nhome of the museum, is Mr. W.D. Lighthall.\r\n\r\nAbout 1892 a strong school of French litterateurs, still\r\nexisting, sprang up with the Ecole Littéraire, which held its\r\nmeetings in the Château de Ramezay. This produced a number of the\r\nbest poets of the time, including Charles Gill, Jean Charbonneau,\r\nDoucet, A. Lozeau, Albert Ferland, Demers, Gonzalve Desaulniers\r\nand others. It published in 1900 the Soirées de Château de\r\nRamezay, which was much praised in Europe and received special\r\nencomium from Ab der Halsen, a distinguished Alsatian critic.\r\n\r\nAmongst the present English literary and debating societies, St.\r\nJames’ Literary Society stands out because of the high standard\r\nof the papers and features given each session by the most able\r\nmen in the city and Canada.\r\n\r\nThe society, which had its inception in the autumn of 1898, began\r\nwith a gathering of twelve men, who met more or less casually\r\nfor mutual intercourse and improvement in connection with St.\r\nJames’ Church. As the society grew in numbers it was felt that a\r\ndefinite constitution should be drawn up and it became henceforth\r\none of acknowledged force in the literary life of the city. Its\r\nmotto _Permitte lucem_ and its emblem the “Lamp of Literature”\r\nindicate its mission. The original name has been retained, but\r\nits membership is broadened for general acceptance. The addresses\r\ngiven during the season are kept on record for reference and\r\nperhaps for future publication.\r\n\r\nIts presidents have been: Rev. C.G. Rollit, 1898-99-1900; J.H.\r\nShaw, 1900-01; John Barrett, 1901-02; W.C. Wonham, 1902-03;\r\nF.W. Hibbard, K.C., 1903-04; J.S. Archibald, 1904-05; M. McD.\r\nDuff, 1905-06; Rev. H. Symonds, D.D., 1906-07; Maxwell Murdock,\r\n1907-08; W.T. Castle, 1908-09; E.G. Place, 1909-10; J. Armitage\r\nEwing, K. C, 1910-11; George Hale, M.D., 1911-12; H.A. Jones,\r\n1912-13; James G. Gray, 1913-14; J.H. Shaw, 1914-15.\r\n\r\nAn interesting and flourishing literary society with a very\r\nlarge active membership is the Dickens Fellowship, which was\r\nestablished in 1909 as a branch of the parent English society of\r\nthe same name, its object being to study the works and the social\r\nlessons of Charles Dickens and to apply his teachings as far as\r\npossible.\r\n\r\nIts presidents have been: J. Portcous Arnold, 1909-10; J.A.\r\nHuchinson, M.D., 1911; W.H. Atherton, Ph. D., 1912-13; W. Godbee\r\nBrown, 1914.\r\n\r\nAt intervals there have been societies for special literary\r\npurposes, such as Shakespeare, Browning and Burns societies. Of\r\nthese one of the most prominent was the Burns Society, which was\r\nstarted about 1857 and only lapsed recently.\r\n\r\nSocieties along national lines have been formed of late years.\r\nThe first established in Montreal is the Alliance Française,\r\nbeing a branch of L’Alliance Française established in France\r\nin 1883. This latter was approved by an act of the minister\r\nof the interior on January 14, 1884, and was recognized as an\r\nestablishment of practical utility by a decree of the republic on\r\nOctober 23, 1886. The end which the Alliance proposes to itself\r\nis two-fold: (1) in the French colonies and protectorates to make\r\nthe language known and loved by the conquered people, to use it\r\nfor social and commercial purposes and to induce colonists to go\r\nfrom France to a country where French is spoken; (2) elsewhere\r\nto maintain relations, (a) with the French-speaking settlers\r\nor groups away among strangers by encouraging them to maintain\r\nthe cult of their national tongue, and (b) with friends of the\r\nFrench language and literature whatever their nationality, race\r\nor creed, so as to draw closer the bonds of a literary and moral\r\nsympathy which unites France to other peoples and to second in\r\nthe East, or in countries still uncivilized, French missionaries\r\nof every denomination, and French lay teachers for the foundation\r\nand maintenance of schools, teaching the French language. A\r\npropaganda is carried out for this purpose with the result that\r\nthere has been formed more than four hundred and fifty committees\r\nin France and other lands.\r\n\r\nAmong other general literary and debating societies of men\r\nof today are the “Nomads,” and those in connection with the\r\nuniversities and colleges, the Y.M. C.A. and other organizations\r\nof a religious, fraternal or social character.\r\n\r\nLiterature is similarly carried on in women circles; the Montreal\r\nWomen’s Club, founded in 1893, being the most representative.\r\n\r\nThe club or society broadest in its conception in the topics\r\ndealt with and in the cosmopolitan character of its speakers\r\nat its weekly lunch is the Canadian Club, which was originally\r\norganized in the city of Hamilton, Ontario, in 1892 with the\r\nobject “To foster patriotism by encouraging the study of the\r\nInstitutions, Arts, Literature, and Resources of Canada and by\r\nendeavouring to unite Canadians in such work for the welfare and\r\nprogress of the Dominion.”\r\n\r\nThe Montreal branch, which was organized in 1905, has now a\r\nmembership of about two thousand, comprising representatives of\r\nevery race living in the city. Practically every person of note\r\nwho has visited Montreal since its incorporation has addressed\r\nthe club, including prominent men such as Jerome K. Jerome who\r\ndelivered the first address in 1905, Booker T. Washington, the\r\nwell known leader of the American negroes; W.T. Stead, the great\r\nEnglish journalist; Rudyard Kipling, the poet, who gave an\r\naddress on “Journalism and Literature”; Rt. Hon. James Bryce, the\r\nEnglish historian, man of letters and statesman; Lord Milner,\r\nthe great pro-consul; Lord Grey; Lord Balfour of Burleigh,\r\nchairman of the commission on Canadian-West Indian reciprocity;\r\nLord Northcliffe, the principal owner of the London Times and\r\nDaily Mail; Hon. C.J. Bonaparte, member of President Roosevelt’s\r\ncabinet and direct descendant of the great Napoleon; Sir Andrew\r\nFraser, one of India’s public servants; Consul Nakamura of Japan;\r\nCommissioner Coombs of the Salvation Army; and the Hon. W.J.\r\nBryan, American silver-tongued orator and secretary of state of\r\nthe United States, etc.\r\n\r\nThe Canadian speakers have included Sir Robert Borden, prime\r\nminister; Sir George Foster; Hon. Rodolphe Lemieux; Dr. W.T.\r\nGrenfell, the missionary of the Labrador coast; Captain Bernier,\r\nthe French-Canadian explorer; President Falconer of Toronto\r\nUniversity; Armand Lavergne, a strong advocate of French-Canadian\r\nnationalism; the local speakers including Henri Bourassa, Doctor\r\nMacphail, the writer; Sir Alexander Lacoste; Doctor Colby;\r\nPrincipal Peterson of McGill University; Hon. J.I. Tarte of\r\nLa Patrie; Hon. L.O. David; Prof. Stephen Leacock; and Judge\r\nChoquet, who spoke on the Juvenile Court in Montreal.\r\n\r\nAs the Canadian clubs were originally designed for men, the women\r\nof Montreal, in 1907, determined to organize a “Women’s Canadian\r\nClub.” This has proved successful, the subjects treated being\r\nspecially applicable to the women and the idea had spread to\r\nthirteen other Canadian cities.\r\n\r\nThere is no doubt but that the idea of Canadian clubs has been\r\nwonderfully successful, for they have given the busy business\r\nmen one day in each week to enjoy lunch at a reasonable price\r\nand then listen for twenty or thirty minutes to the best man\r\nwho happened to be in the city at that moment or to have been\r\nspecially invited for the purpose. It has brought its members\r\ninto personal touch with the great leaders of thought and those\r\nwho control the destinies of the British Empire, and because of\r\nits national character it has been a large factor in breaking\r\ndown class and racial prejudices that have too often been a\r\njarring note in the progress of Montreal.\r\n\r\n\r\n                   III. ARTISTIC ASSOCIATIONS\r\n\r\nA great influence in the intellectual and artistic life of the\r\nCity of Montreal has been gradually brought about by the church\r\namongst the French section, and amongst the English by little\r\ncoteries of friends meeting first at private houses and as the\r\ncircles became larger, in more public places. In this way the\r\nCultural Associations of Montreal arose.\r\n\r\nIn a number of the societies, such as the Antiquarian and\r\nNumismatic Society, the two races have been brought together,\r\nbut generally speaking each race has developed mentally and\r\nsocially along its own lines, insufficiently co-mingling even on\r\nintellectual and artistic grounds.\r\n\r\nBut while there is no amalgamation of the two races there is\r\ngreat respect and harmony, mutual admiration, imitation and\r\nassimilation, unless this state is upset by self-interested\r\ndemagogues, and it is in this tacit understanding that they\r\nhave built up side by side many French and English libraries,\r\nand literary, artistic and musical societies, the influence of\r\nwhich has considerably raised the mental standard of Canada’s\r\ncommercial metropolis. While, however, there is to be deplored\r\na certain weakness through the want of concentration, yet it is\r\nsomewhat productive of a healthy rivalry and a varied viewpoint.\r\nMore fusion, however, would be mutually advantageous, to gain the\r\nfullest advantage from the juxtaposition of the heritors of two\r\ngreat racial civilizations in one city.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               ART\r\n\r\nArt in Montreal can be divided into four periods, each having\r\nits own influence, not only on the people of the time and on\r\nthe private collections, but on the work of local artists, many\r\nof whom, until late years, were never able to study the great\r\ncollections of Europe. The first period might be termed the\r\nchurch influence, for during the earliest part of the French\r\nrégime the Jesuit records indicate the fact that a number of\r\nthe earliest missionaries, men of learning and culture, did not\r\nneglect art or music in bringing their Indian neophytes under the\r\nspell of Christianity. Several of the Montreal Jesuits were no\r\nmean artists or musicians. The members of the earliest religious\r\ncorporations also brought out works of art in furniture and\r\naltar ornaments. Thus in the Catholic churches of the provinces\r\nthere are many fine pieces of decoration which were designed in\r\nEurope of the sixteenth century. Later when the French became\r\nmore settled in New France, the officers, both military and\r\ncivil, brought out their families, who in addition to bringing\r\nout the family paintings and decorations introduced the culture\r\nof old France. In addition art began to be taught in the earliest\r\ntechnical schools, one of which, the classes of the Fréres\r\nCharron of Montreal followed somewhat the example of the first\r\ntechnical school established by Bishop Laval outside Quebec. This\r\nmight be termed the second period. The third began soon after the\r\nconquest, 1670, when, with the arrival of British officers and\r\nofficials, British art was introduced, not in specimens alone,\r\nfor it was found that amongst the officers of the engineers\r\nand artillery there were a number of good artists who soon\r\nmixed with the local art lovers. Thus they helped in forming in\r\n1847 an art society under the name of the “Montreal Society of\r\nArtists” which gave a modest exhibition to initiate the “Montreal\r\nGallery of Pictures.” The second exhibition was held in 1857 in\r\nthe Bonaventure Hall under the auspices and direction of the\r\nMercantile Library Association. The artists represented at this\r\nexhibition were Cooper, David Cox, Kneller, Guido, Jan, Steen,\r\nReynolds, Raphael, Vinci, Rubens, Van Dyke, Titian, Lawrence and\r\nWatteau. This being from local collections shows something of the\r\nlove of good pictures by the wealthy Montrealers of that day even\r\nif only copies of these masters were available.\r\n\r\nThe fourth period is now with us.\r\n\r\nThe Society of Artists in 1860 believing that the time had come\r\nfor broadening its sphere of usefulness invited lovers of art\r\nas well as artists to join them and “The Art Association of\r\nMontreal” thus became formed. The act to incorporate this new\r\nventure was assented to on April 23, 1860, at the request of\r\nthe Rt. Rev. Francis Fulford, Lord Bishop of Montreal, the Rev.\r\nWilliam T. Leach, William H.A. Davies, Thomas D. King, Esquires,\r\nand others. Five years afterwards the association formed itself\r\ninto an Art Union, and in the same year published a catalogue\r\nwith articles on Oil Painting, Water Colours and Engraving, by\r\nF.T. Palgrave, reduced from the art catalogue of the great London\r\nExhibition of 1862. The principal feature of the exhibition held\r\nin 1867 was a number of water colours by the Montreal Sketching\r\nClub, including two by Alfred Rimmer who afterwards made a\r\nreputation by his beautiful book illustrations of English country\r\nlife. In the following year the Society of Canadian Artists held\r\nits first exhibition in the Gallery of the Art Association,\r\nthen in a large room at the Mercantile Library Building. The\r\nseventh exhibition of the association in 1872 was also held\r\nin the same building, while in 1878 the eighth was held in the\r\nWindsor Hotel. By the magnificent gift of Benaiah Gibb the Art\r\nAssociation was enabled to have its own building on Phillip’s\r\nSquare. On the completion of the building in 1879 an exhibition\r\nwas held to celebrate the opening. Mr. Gibb’s munificence gave\r\na great impetus to art in Montreal both then and when he died\r\nin the following year, bequeathing his valuable collection,\r\nconsisting of seventy-two pictures and four bronzes to the Art\r\nAssociation in trust for the citizens of Montreal. In the earlier\r\npart of the same year (1880) a loan collection of oil paintings\r\nhad been held including two sketches by H.R.H. Princess Louise,\r\nwife of the governor general who had opened the art gallery. The\r\nJ.W. Tempest bequest in 1892 of $80,000 has also been one of\r\nthe God-sends to the association. He also left a very valuable\r\ncollection of pictures containing some very fine work.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ART GALLERY]\r\n\r\nThe first black and white exhibition was held in 1881, and\r\nincluded the work of Durer, Bartolozzi, S.W. Reynolds, Charles\r\nTurner and J.M. Turner. At this exhibition a paper was read by\r\nMr. McLennan on “Engraving” which was illustrated by woodcuts\r\nand specimens of engraving on metal, and in the same year a\r\ncollection was held of the works of Canadian artists.\r\n\r\nSince that time all kinds of exhibitions have been held in the\r\ngalleries of the Art Association, each one growing more popular\r\nas the public taste in art has increased. So much so that the\r\nassociation, finding the quarters on Phillip’s Square too small\r\nto meet the increased attendances, determined to sell the\r\nbuilding which had been the home of art for so many years and,\r\nwith the proceeds together with the result of a special campaign\r\nwhich netted over two hundred and sixty thousand dollars, to\r\nbuild an art gallery worthy of the great City of Montreal. Such\r\nis the present beautiful Art Gallery Building on Sherbrooke\r\nStreet, opened by H.R.H., the Duke of Connaught on December 9,\r\n1912. Its architects were Edward and William S. Maxwell of this\r\ncity.\r\n\r\nThe late Mr. James Ross, besides contributing $125,000 during\r\nhis life time, bequeathed $100,000 to the association and the\r\nlate Mr. Learmont and his sister bequeathed between them their\r\nsplendid collection of paintings and china. The president of the\r\nArt Association is Mr. H.V. Meredith, president of the Bank of\r\nMontreal, and the membership is around two thousand; the curator\r\nand secretary being Mr. J.B. Abbott, son of the late Sir John\r\nAbbott, prime minister of Canada.\r\n\r\nThe permanent collection of the new art gallery consists of\r\n626 pieces, including oil paintings, watercolours, etchings,\r\nstatuary, casts and bronzes, with the Learmont collection, the\r\ndonation of rare china and pottery consisting of 170 pieces, and\r\na number of pictures filling one of the rooms, among which are\r\nworks by Turner, Swan, Gainsborough and Reynolds. Among the other\r\nartists represented in the gallery, are Bougeaureau, Constant,\r\nCorot, Diaz of Peña, Goya, Henner, Monticelli, Millet, Pasini,\r\nRaeburn, Soest, Tholen, Treyon, Van Goyen, Van de Velde, Van\r\nDyck, Whistler and Wilkie. There are also copies after Sarto,\r\nTitian and Salvator Rosa; bronzes by Clesinger, Guillemin, Rodin\r\nand Tout Mackenzie, and statuary by Benzoni, Bosio, Hébert and\r\nRomanelli. The library of the association has, through the\r\ngenerosity of its members, become one of the most complete\r\ncollections of reference books on art in Canada.\r\n\r\nIt has been said that Montreal has some of the finest private\r\ncollections of masters on this continent and that if all were on\r\nexhibition under one roof, the artistic wealth of the community\r\nwould be found to be very considerable.\r\n\r\nAmong the notable collections of private citizens, the possession\r\nof the following, among others, may be ascribed to the possession\r\nof: The late _Lord Strathcona_: works by Turner, Henner, Jules\r\nBréton, etc.; _Sir William Van Horne_: Monticelli, Rousseau,\r\nDaubigny, Corot, Delacroix, Rubens, Turner, Cuyp, Ruysdal,\r\nRaeburn, as well as examples by the advanced modern painters of\r\nthe French post impressionist school; _Lady Drummond_: Reynolds,\r\nFranz Hals, Rosetti, Turner, Ruysdal, Troyon, Daubigny, Duprès,\r\nPeter de Hooge, etc.; _R. B. Angus_: Gainsborough, Romney,\r\nRembrandt, Dagnan-Bouveret, Swan, Reynolds, Monticelli, Ruysdal,\r\nHoppner, Aumier; the _late James Ross_: Rembrandt, Corot, Troyon,\r\nMillet, Fortuny, Teniers, Turner, Cuyp, Joseph Israels, Romney,\r\nFranz Hals; _E.B. Greenshields_: Turner, Ryder, etc., and a\r\nnumber of the modern Dutch school including Joseph Israels,\r\nJacob, William and Maris; Mauve, Weissenbruch, etc.\r\n\r\nAll the owners mentioned above, as well as many others with\r\nsmaller collections, have been very generous subscribers to the\r\nart gallery, both in pictures and money.\r\n\r\nA special branch of the association is the art school under the\r\ndirection of Mr. William Brymner, president of the Royal Canadian\r\nAcademy, who has associated with him Maurice Cullen, R.C.A.,\r\nand Miss Alberta Cleland. In addition might be added the series\r\nof lectures that are given each season by specialists on the\r\ndifferent branches of art. Outside the convents, the principal\r\nschool of art attended by French pupils is the School of Arts and\r\nManufactures which is held in the Monument National. This school\r\nwas founded by the Abbé Chabert in 1860, who at one time had been\r\na successful professor of arts at the Ottawa College. He made the\r\nschool one of the best in Canada and many well known artists of\r\ntoday received their first instruction in this school.\r\n\r\nComing to the personnel of art, Montreal has in Louis Philippe\r\nHébert one who takes a high place among Canadian sculptors. His\r\nwork, many examples of which are on the public squares of the\r\ncity, is equally a monument to his genius as to those whom he\r\nportrayed in bronze and stone. When the honour of C.M.G. was\r\nconferred upon him by King Edward in 1903 it was felt that the\r\nrepresentative of Canadian art was well chosen. Another fine\r\nCanadian artist who has for many years made Montreal his home\r\nis Mr. Robert Harris, also a C.M.G., a former president of the\r\nR.C.A. Among other Montreal artists are Napoleon Bourassa,\r\ndecorator and architect of the Church of Notre Dame de Lourdes\r\nand others; George William Hill, the designer and sculptor of the\r\nCartier memorial and many other monuments.\r\n\r\nAmong other artistic associations is the Woman’s Art Society,\r\nwhich was founded in 1893 to encourage art amongst its members\r\nand to assist kindred societies. Thus it presented a scholarship\r\nto the Art Association for competition in the schools, and\r\ncooperates with the Canadian Handicrafts Guild, which was\r\nestablished in 1906 to encourage, retain, revive and develop\r\nhandicrafts and home art industries throughout the Dominion.\r\nThis guild with headquarters in Montreal, has as patrons T.R.H.\r\nthe Duke and Duchess of Connaught with a large general committee\r\nand honorary council of men and women who give their time\r\nungrudgingly in the interests of homely crafts which are in these\r\ndays of materialism and utilitarism in danger of extinction.\r\n\r\nThe Château de Ramezay, as the home of the Antiquarian Society,\r\nhas many historical records of the art of the past, the chief\r\nfeatures being in the Elgin room, where are many historical\r\nportraits and relics, including the bell of Louisburg and the\r\n“Montreal” Room, where a valuable series of historical maps and\r\npictures of the city is preserved; while the council chamber, the\r\nsalon, the parloir, the vaults, the kitchen, and the bakery are\r\nall reminiscent of the early days of the city.\r\n\r\nThere is also the valuable private collection of Mr. R. McCord at\r\nTemplegrove, known as McCord’s National Museum. It is to be hoped\r\nthat such collections will be gradually acquired for the public.\r\n\r\nThe Royal Academy of Arts, of which the director of the school\r\nattached to the Art Association is president, has an exhibition\r\nof paintings every four years in Montreal.\r\n\r\nWe may here mention the Royal Society of Canada, which has a\r\nliterary and scientific, as well as an artistic, scope and which\r\nheld its meetings in Montreal this year (1914), being largely\r\nassociated with the city because of its first meeting in 1882\r\ntaking place here and the first executive being principally\r\nresidents of Montreal. Its first president was the late Sir\r\nWilliam Dawson of McGill, and the first vice president the Hon.\r\nDr. P.J.O. Chauveau, LL. D., and amongst the charter members\r\nappear the names of N. Bourassa, Louis Frechette, LL. D., John\r\nL’Esperance, John Reade, J. Clark Murray, Sir A.B. Routhier and\r\nother Montrealers. This year’s president is Dr. Adams of McGill.\r\n\r\nIn reviewing this chapter one would say that the City of\r\nMontreal since it became the home of civilization has had great\r\nopportunities to enrich itself artistically and mentally,\r\nbecause of the environments of romance that surround it and the\r\natmosphere of cultured men and women, who in each generation\r\nhave breathed its air. The citizens are essentially lovers of\r\neverything that will raise the standard of intellectual living,\r\nbut the temptation to the present generation to pursue more\r\nseriously material success, has detracted somewhat from the\r\nclaims of literature and art as a valuable possession and a title\r\nto distinction. Art, literature and culture have too few patrons\r\nto endow struggling works which, if fostered, would be a lasting\r\nmemorial and satisfaction to their donors and benefactors. Yet\r\nthis failing is but temporary for with the passing away of the\r\nfalse opulence begotten of real estate booms and financial\r\nspeculations, the people will come back to their real love, and\r\nart and literature with the love of the true, the good, and the\r\nbeautiful in life, will take their proper place in the composite\r\nlife of Montreal.\r\n\r\nFor the sake of recording the names of those who have left a\r\nreputation as artists at Montreal and Quebec the following notes\r\nmay be preserved:\r\n\r\nPère André Pierron, S.J., before 1673; Frère Luc, a Récollet;\r\nPère Pommier, about the same time; Pierre Leber; Jean Antoine\r\nCréque, born 1749, died 1780; * De Beaucourt, born about 1735;\r\n* Louis Dulogpré, worked in Montreal and Quebec from about\r\n1790-1830; * William Van Moll Berczy, painted in Montreal from\r\nabout 1800-1818;---- Audy, from about 1804-1830; Joseph Legare,\r\nborn 1795, was working in 1826; * Antoine Plamandon, born about\r\n1800, lived nearly through the century; * Cornelius Kreighoff,\r\nborn 1814, died 1872; James Duncan, born 1806, died 1881; *\r\nWilliam Sawyer, born 1820, died 1889; * Théophile Hamel, born\r\n1814, died 1870; * Adolphe Vogt, born 1842, died 1870; * Allan\r\nEdson, born 1846, died 1888; * Wyatt Eaton, born 1849, died 1896;\r\n* O.

Morrice, born 1864;\r\n(Clarence) Gagnon; F. St. Charles; J.C. Franchere; Charles Gill;\r\nWilliam Hope; John Hammond; Horne Russell; Laura Muntz; G.\r\nDelfosse. There are also many other artists in Montreal, but the\r\nabove are certainly all names which are well known to art lovers\r\nhere and have been for some time identified with the art we have\r\nof the city.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            THE DRAMA\r\n\r\nAmateur theatricals have been in vogue in Montreal for many\r\nyears. Among the officers of the garrison under the French\r\nrégime, doubtless and certainly among the young scholars taught\r\nby the “Congregation” and the Sulpicians, whose students of the\r\nCollege de Montréal performed early in the British Rule the play\r\n“David and Jonathan or The Triumph of Friendship.”\r\n\r\nHowever the drama proper in Montreal dates especially from\r\n1804, when a Mr. Ormsby, from the Theatre Royal, Edinborough,\r\nestablished a company of comedians to perform a play in five\r\nacts called “The Busy Body” and a farce entitled “The Sultan.” A\r\nbuilding next to the old postoffice was fitted up and the charges\r\nwere: boxes, 5s. and gallery, 2s. 6d. Circuses came and went, a\r\nnotable one taking place in 1812. In the early ’40s there was\r\nstill standing the Theatre Royal, built in 1825 and situated\r\nopposite Rasco’s Hotel on Bonsecours Street, then the great hotel\r\nof the city and it was in this house that Charles Dickens acted\r\nduring his visit in 1842. The second Theatre Royal, in Coté\r\nStreet was opened in 1850, and which after a long, splendid and\r\neventful career, closed its doors ignominiously in 1913. One of\r\nits early lessees was J.W. Buckland, who engaged a good stock\r\ncompany, which gave such plays as “Peg Woffington,” “Rob Roy” and\r\n“The Cricket on the Hearth.” This theatre in its palmiest days\r\nenjoyed the patronage of the élite and military of the city and\r\nwhen any stars visited Montreal, such as Jenny Lind, Patti and\r\nKean, the Theatre Royal was the scene of their triumphs.[1]\r\n\r\nThe present City Hall Annex on Gosford Street is built on the\r\nsite of the old Dominion Theatre, which up to 1864 had been an\r\nAnglican church, then a vinegar factory, before being turned\r\ninto what the proprietors claimed to be the largest and most\r\nup-to-date theatre in the city. But it did not have a very long\r\nlife. One of the first plays to be given on its stage was the\r\n“Commune,” a sensational melodrama of the French Commune. Kate\r\nQuinton, who in her day had somewhat of a reputation, was the\r\nstar of the play. After one year of melodrama the proprietors\r\ntried vaudeville, principally using local talent. It was at this\r\ntheatre that Madame Albani, then Miss Emma Lejeunesse of Chambly,\r\nwhose father was a music teacher, made one of her earliest\r\nappearances as a pianist. In those early days the great singer\r\ndid not know that she possessed the wonderful voice which has\r\nsince entranced the world with its beauty. In 1871 the Dominion\r\nchanged the character of its bill of fare again, this time to\r\nopera, under the name of Debar’s Opera House, though dramatic\r\nplays were given at times as a change. It was at this theatre\r\nthat L. Guyon, in 1878, tried his prentice hand as a dramatist\r\nin the play “Le Secret de la Roche Noire.” The following year\r\nanother play from his pen was produced “La Fleur de Lys.” The\r\nplays were staged by the local Cercle Dramatique Jacques Cartier.\r\nThis society continued to produce plays until 1889 when the\r\ntheatre, which had been its home was sold. Since that date many\r\nFrench Canadian dramatic societies, such as those at the Theâtre\r\nNational Français and the Theâtre des Nouveautés, have come into\r\nbeing most of them being very successful, indeed it has been said\r\nby the critics that the standing of these amateur productions is\r\noften higher than that of visiting professional companies.\r\n\r\nAs the residential part of the city spread northwards the Queen’s\r\nHall appeared on St. Catherine Street, between University and\r\nVictoria streets, being burnt down in 1874, about which time a\r\nnew theatre was built called “The Academy of Music,” on Victoria\r\nStreet, which in a short time took the place of the Theatre\r\nRoyal as the fashionable place of amusement. On its stage many\r\nfamous actors have appeared--Irving, Terry, Bancroft, Wyndham,\r\nToole--etc. In time “His Majesty’s Theatre” became the leading\r\nEnglish theatre and about the same time the “Français” was\r\nopened, first for the production of French plays and afterward\r\nfor melodrama, as well as a number of small French theatres.\r\nThe position of the English theatres in 1908 stood as follows:\r\nleading theatre, “His Majesty’s”; for musical comedy, “Academy of\r\nMusic”; for melodrama, the “Français”; for burlesque, the “Royal”\r\nand the “Theatre Royal.” The “Princess” for general purposes\r\nfollowed immediately.\r\n\r\nUntil recently, with an occasional visit by an English company,\r\nmost of the plays put on the Montreal boards were by companies\r\nfrom the United States, but during the last four years England’s\r\nbest companies have visited Montreal, including Marie Tempest,\r\nSir Beerbohm Tree, Sir Forbes Robertson, Sir Charles Wyndham,\r\nHorniman Players, Charles Harvey, etc. To-day there are catering\r\nto the English public, two first class theatres (“His Majesty’s”\r\nand “Princess”), one vaudeville (“Orpheum”), one burlesque\r\n(“Gaiety”), and 200 moving picture theatres, headed by the\r\n“Imperial,” which holds about 2,500 people.\r\n\r\nThere are a number of small French theatres, one or two\r\nrunning stock, but most of them are the home of amateur\r\ndramatic companies, and consequently circumscribed in doing\r\nreally ambitious work, but as already stated, very creditable\r\nperformances are to be seen at these theatres. Sarah Bernhardt,\r\nthe great French actress, has played in Montreal several times\r\nand her art has always been equally acceptable to English\r\nand French, thus drawing full houses in the largest theatre\r\navailable. Of late years the “Arena,” a skating rink, has been\r\nthe scene of the greatest gatherings for concerts, horse shows\r\nand motor shows.\r\n\r\nThe Monument National has been the scene of many ambitious and\r\nsuccessful French dramas and comedies. There also are given, from\r\ntime to time, good dramas in Hebrew by competent artists and\r\nthese plays, mostly of a serious nature, are much appreciated by\r\nthe Jewish residents of Montreal.\r\n\r\nAmong the amateur dramatic societies there is La Section\r\nLittéraire et Dramatique du Cercle Jeanne D’Arc, while many of\r\nthe churches, colleges and schools have their own societies,\r\nthe best known of which, that attached to Trinity Church, which\r\nunder the well known Montreal actor, W.A. Tremayne, gives, during\r\nthe season, a production of a very high order each month. The\r\nDickens’ Fellowship also gives each season representations of the\r\ndramatized works of the great master.\r\n\r\nThe amateur drama has not fared ill in Montreal. It was in\r\nMontreal that the great Canadian actress, Margaret Anglin,\r\nreceived her education in a convent of this city; other artists\r\neducated here being Maxine Elliot, Gertrude Elliot, the wife of\r\nSir Forbes Robertson; Miss Marie Tempest, and Madame Donalda, the\r\nCanadian singer.\r\n\r\nAs a sign of the interest being awakened in the drama in\r\nMontreal, it is pleasing to record the birth, during the last two\r\nyears, of the Drama League for the purposes of promoting the true\r\ninterests of the theatre and the cultivation of a right drama in\r\nthe city.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              MUSIC\r\n\r\nMusic naturally came into this country with the French, who are\r\nessentially musical, for the church encouraged this trait by\r\naffording many occasions for the best music. Good voices were\r\neasily procurable and every encouragement was also given to\r\norchestral music, both in the churches and in the home. From\r\nthis there spread out the desire for musical associations. Among\r\nmodern societies that of the Société de Ste. Cécile was founded\r\nby A.J. Boucher on November 11, 1860, and there followed in\r\n1861 the Société Musicale des Montaguards Canadiens founded by\r\nFrançois Benoit. The English also did not neglect musical culture\r\nand about this time the “Amateur Musical League of Montreal” was\r\nfounded by a Mr. Torrington who was organist of the St. James\r\nMethodist Church.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the most noted musical organization which Montreal has\r\never possessed was the Mendelssohn Choir, a private society\r\ninitiated in 1884 by the late Mr. Joseph Gould, who during its\r\nwhole musical life of thirty years, acted as its sole business\r\nmanager and conductor. The Choir was composed of picked voices,\r\nto the number, in its later years, of about one hundred and\r\ntwenty-five. Its _forte_ lay in its remarkable unaccompanied\r\npart-singing which was compared by competent judges with the best\r\nperformances of Henry Leslie’s choir in London, in those days,\r\nperhaps the most famous body of its kind in the world.\r\n\r\nThe first Mendelssohn Choir concerts were given in Mr. Gould’s\r\npiano warerooms on St. James’ Street, admission being exclusively\r\nby invitation. After a few years, subscribing annual members were\r\nreceived, in addition to the active members. The concerts thus\r\nbecame, and thereafter continued to be, subscription concerts;\r\nand were given in the principal public halls, the Mechanics’\r\nHall, the Queen’s Hall, and others being successively used.\r\nMany of the most celebrated artists, both instrumentalists\r\nand vocalists, who have visited Montreal, were introduced to\r\nthe public at Mendelssohn Choir concerts, although the chief\r\nattraction always continued to be the singing of the Choir\r\nitself, whose reputation gradually extended throughout Canada to\r\nthe United States and even to Europe.\r\n\r\nIn 1894 Mr. Gould, owing chiefly to failing health, resigned his\r\nposition as conductor and director, and the Choir, unwilling to\r\nsing under any other leader, voluntarily disbanded.\r\n\r\nTwo other contemporary musical societies at this period have\r\nalso left a void in the city. The Handel and Hayden Society and\r\nthe Philharmonic, the former being led by Professor Rayner, and\r\nthe latter organization as notable as the Mendelssohn Choir,\r\nby Professor Couture. The rôle of the Philharmonic, however,\r\nwas oratorio with orchestral accompaniment. The first steps for\r\norganization were taken in 1877 by three concerts given under\r\nthe name of the Montreal Musical Festival held in the Victoria\r\nSkating Rink. The object was to produce in Montreal two of the\r\ngrand musical productions with first class soloists, choir and\r\norchestra, after the manner of the great English festivals.\r\n\r\nThe name of the “Montreal Philharmonic” appeared on December\r\n17, 1877, on the first programme of the new combination, at\r\nthe concert held in the Academy of Music, then new. Its first\r\npresident and conductor was Dr. McLagan, who was followed in 1879\r\nby Mr. F.E. Lucy-Barnes, and by Mr. Couture, who undertook his\r\nfirst concert on December 9, 1880, and who directed his large\r\nchoirs, averaging two hundred and fifty voices, till the lapse\r\nof the Philharmonic in 1899. From its inception most of the\r\ngreat oratorios including the works of Wagner were excellently\r\nrendered, supplemented by the Boston Symphony Orchestra and\r\nothers of a continental reputation. The soloists were the best\r\navailable artists before the public on the continent, including\r\nEmma Thursby, Max Heinrich, Prehn, W. Ludwig, W.H. Regia, Emma\r\nJuch, Martens, Conrad Behrens, Emma Poole King, Frangcon Davies,\r\nIrene Devny, Etalka Gerster and others, the work of inviting\r\nthese falling for the last eleven years on the secretary, Mr.\r\nArthur H. Browning. The presidents of the association have been\r\nMessrs. Arthur W. Perkins, Hector McKenzie, Angus W. Hooper and\r\nCharles Cassels.\r\n\r\nSince the cessation of these associations, which fell because\r\nof insufficient support and suitable concert halls, nothing has\r\nreplaced them adequately. The most notable body of today is the\r\n“Chorale St. Louis de France,” attached to the church of that\r\nname. Other churches produce oratorios but without the same\r\nresources as the combinations of the past. Although in the more\r\nmodern city the great European and American soloists are brought\r\nthere is not the same degree of musical education for the people\r\nas in the more quiet and studious times of a quarter of a century\r\nago.\r\n\r\nMiller’s Band, attached to the British regiments stationed in\r\nMontreal, was a most popular musical institution for many years.\r\nIt played often at the Viger Gardens and was instrumental in\r\ncreating a taste for good music among the residents of the city.\r\nThe band remained here until the military left in the fall of\r\n1869, returning to England with the regiments. After it left,\r\nthings were somewhat dull in Montreal until a number of the Grand\r\nTrunk employees organized a band made up of the musicians of the\r\ndisbanded regiments who preferred to stay in Montreal rather than\r\ngo back to England. The conductor was a man named Zeiglar. Early\r\nin the ’70s the Boston Symphony Orchestra began to come and small\r\nopera troupes of Italian singers about the same time who gave\r\nconcerts in the Mechanics’ Hall. Christine Neilson was heard in\r\nthe Victoria Skating Rink.\r\n\r\nIn 1871, a season of grand opera was given in Montreal by Sig.\r\nEnrico Corana, the company including the following stars: Madame\r\nElena Corani, Madle, Caterani Lami, Sigs. Pietro Baccei, G.\r\nReina, G. Pauliny, Nicolini and Nicolao. The operas included\r\nDonizetti’s Lucretia Borgia and Flotow’s Martha, but it was not\r\nuntil about four years ago that a full season was given in the\r\ncity by the Montreal Grand Opera Company which, after running two\r\nseasons, was disbanded because of the great financial deficit. It\r\nwas found that to make grand opera pay in Montreal a much larger\r\ntheatre was required to hold a sufficiently big audience to pay\r\nfor the elaborate production required today. Practically every\r\nmodern musical genius of the world has visited Montreal and since\r\norchestral music has taken hold of the public, both New York and\r\nBoston having sent their best organizations to the city.\r\n\r\nThe bands attached to the four local regiments and the St.\r\nLouis Cadets are well trained musicians who periodically, but\r\nnot often, give concerts in the parks of the city. A number of\r\nprivate bands, both orchestral and military are also doing good\r\nwork.\r\n\r\nEducationally Montreal has made great advances in music during\r\nthis last ten years. McGill University has added to its\r\ncurriculum courses in instrumental and vocal music through its\r\nConservatorium of Music, under the directorship of Doctor Perrin\r\n(late organist of Canterbury Cathedral, England) and gives\r\ndegrees to its successful pupils, and both the Royal Academy of\r\nMusic and the London College of Music have branches in the city.\r\n\r\nBut for a large city, where there is as much instrumental talent,\r\nthere is a singular lack of orchestral entertainment for the\r\npublic. The appetite for culture grows on what it feeds; the food\r\nbeing scanty the growth is small.\r\n\r\n\r\n                 NEWSPAPERS--MONTREAL HISTORIES\r\n\r\nThe newspapers and periodicals of a city being among the chief\r\nmeans of popular education and also a running historical\r\ncommentary of the times, a brief synopsis of the present\r\nsituation may now be given:\r\n\r\nAt present there are the following newspapers:\r\n\r\n\r\n                             ENGLISH\r\n\r\nThe Gazette, originally published by Fleury Mesplet in French\r\non June 3, 1778, under the title of “Gazette der Commerce et\r\nLittéraire.”\r\n\r\n(The Quebec Gazette appeared in French and English from June\r\n21, 1764, to October 30, 1874.) The Gazette in Montreal quickly\r\nbecame English. Curiously enough there have been others of the\r\nsame name. There was the Montreal Gazette, started on August\r\n3, 1795, published by Edwards in both languages, till 1801.\r\nAnother of the same name appeared in 1796, by Joseph Roy, but its\r\nexistence was short.\r\n\r\nThe Montreal Herald was founded on October 19, 1811, and was\r\nprinted by William Gray.\r\n\r\nThe Montreal Evening Star was founded as a daily in 1869 by (Sir)\r\nHugh Graham. (The Weekly Star also appears.)\r\n\r\nThe Weekly Witness (the sequent of the Montreal Witness) was\r\nestablished as a weekly in 1846 and as a daily in 1860.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MONUMENT TO JACQUES CARTIER, DISCOVERER OF\r\nMONTREAL, ERECTED AT ST. HENRI, MONTREAL]\r\n\r\nThe Weekly Standard appeared first September 23, 1905.\r\n\r\nThe Daily Mail, published by the Daily Mail Publishing Company,\r\nappeared on October 5, 1913.\r\n\r\nThe Evening News, published by the News Publishing Company at\r\nMontreal (M.E. Nichols and B.A. Macnab editors and managers),\r\nappeared on May 27, 1914.\r\n\r\nBeck’s Weekly, published by Edward Beck, appeared March 21, 1914.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             FRENCH\r\n\r\nLa Patrie was founded on February 24, 1879.\r\n\r\nLa Presse was founded by T. Berthiaume in 1884. (A paper of the\r\nsame name appeared with one issue only in the previous year, on\r\nMay 1st.)\r\n\r\nLe Canada was founded in April, 1903.\r\n\r\nLe Devoir, founded by Henri Bourassa, appeared first on January\r\n11, 1910. There are also the following weeklies: Le Pays, Le\r\nBullétin, Le Canard (illustrated), La Croix, L’Opinion, Le Prix\r\nCourant and Le Samedi.\r\n\r\nThere are other racial papers, the Jewish Chronicle in English\r\nand Der Adler (The Eagle) in Yiddish, and two Italian papers.\r\nCommercial Montreal has a daily newspaper under the name of the\r\nJournal of Commerce, an amalgamation of the Journal of Commerce,\r\nestablished in 1852, the Shareholder, established in 1856, and\r\nthe following weeklies: The Financial Times; Trade Bulletin,\r\n1882; Le Moniteur de Commerce, 1880.\r\n\r\nThere are also published in the city a number of educational,\r\ntechnical, religious and trade periodicals, and the following\r\nmonthlies: the Canada West Indian Magazine, the Canadian\r\nMunicipal Journal, La Revue Populaire, La Revue Canadienne, etc.\r\n\r\nIt would be a fascinating study to pursue the history of defunct\r\nnewspapers, but, since up to 1904 Dr. Dionne made his abstract of\r\nthe names and numbers of 800 newspapers, journals, etc., printed\r\nat one time or another in French in the Province of Quebec,\r\nand 681 in English, of both of which so many have appeared at\r\nMontreal, the treatment to be given would outrun this present\r\npurpose. The same is to be said of the history of publications of\r\na general character which in 1906 amounted to 2,921 in English\r\nand 3,092 in French, registered and published in the Province of\r\nQuebec.\r\n\r\nMontreal has taken a great part as the publication centre of the\r\nabove. As, however, the treatment adopted has been the record\r\nof institutions rather than personal works, the appreciation of\r\nMontreal writers in French and English is here foregone. A note\r\nmay be placed on our historians.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       MONTREAL HISTORIES\r\n\r\nThe literature of Montreal begins with Jacques Cartier,[2] who\r\nwrote a full description of his visit to Hochelaga in 1535 and\r\ndescribed the people there. The next writer was Samuel de\r\nChamplain in the beginning of the seventeenth century, who made\r\nhis map of the island and described his trading post at Place\r\nRoyale. After the foundation of Montreal in 1642 the Jesuits in\r\ntheir “Relations” have given us sidelights of its progress and\r\nafter the coming of the Sulpicians in 1657 and Dollier de Casson,\r\nthe soldier Sulpician, wrote the first “Histoire de Montreal.”\r\nAnother contemporary Sulpician of Montreal, the Abbé de Belmont,\r\nwrote a history of Canada. The Jesuit Charlevoix, who wrote his\r\nhistory of Canada later, at the end of the first quarter of the\r\neighteenth century, penned much of his work at Montreal. Peter\r\nKalm, the Swiss traveller, has left us a valuable picture of\r\n1749. Later writers who have contributed to our knowledge of\r\nMontreal are Montcalm and De Levis, the soldiers who had their\r\nheadquarters in this city and whose letters and journals contain\r\nmuch history leading to the fall of Montreal in 1760.\r\n\r\nUnder the English rule the French writers, who have contributed\r\nto our knowledge of the history of Montreal have been the\r\nfollowing: The Montreal historian, Michel Bibaud, who in 1837\r\npublished the first volume of his “Histoire du Canada Sous\r\nla Domination Française.” Jacques Viger, the first Mayor of\r\nMontreal, began publishing his various archaeological and\r\nhistorical studies of the city about 1840. Between 1852 and 1865\r\nthe Abbé Fallon published the lives of Marguerite Bourgeoys,\r\nJeanne Mance and Madame d’Youville, and his lengthy work of\r\nthe “Histoire de La Colonie Française,” which only went as far\r\nas 1672 but contains valuable Montreal history. The same is to\r\nbe said of the history of F.X. Garneau, who, however, is to\r\nbe more closely connected with Quebec. The Montreal Societe\r\nHistorique and the Numismatic and Antiquarian Society have\r\neach produced writers already named who have surveyed Montreal\r\nunder the historical or archaeological aspect. The “Annuaire de\r\nVille Marie,” by Huguet-Latour, is one of such contributions. A\r\n“Histoire Populaire de Montreal” was published by M. le Bloud\r\nBrumath in 1890.\r\n\r\nWith reference to English historians of Montreal outside the\r\nfugitive references in works by Heriot, Weld, Lambert and\r\nothers, no important specific history of the city appeared\r\nuntil “Hochelaga Depicta” by Newton Bosworth in 1839, followed\r\nin 1870 by Alfred Sandham’s “Ville Marie, Past and Present,”\r\nwhich later was succeeded by the Rev. J. Bosworth’s Studies of\r\nMontreal, the History of Montreal (in 1875), that of the prisons\r\n(1886), and others later. In 1887 the Rev. Robert Campbell, D.D.,\r\npublished his History of St. Gabriel Street Church, which was\r\na valuable contribution to the “Scotch” history of the city.\r\n“Lights and Shrines” and “Montreal after 250 Years,” appeared by\r\nW.D. Lighthall in 1892 to celebrate the two hundred and fiftieth\r\nanniversary of the foundation of the city. Terrill’s “Chronology\r\nof Montreal and Canada” appeared in 1893. Of late years there\r\nhave also been several sketches and semi-advertising ventures\r\nof a historical nature. In addition there have been numerous\r\ngazeteers and studies, in French and English, of Montreal\r\npersonages, the last to appear being that of the History and\r\nTimes of George Etienne Cartier by John Boyd.\r\n\r\nThe occasion of the international war of 1914 affords a suitable\r\nopportunity for the publication of the present work, to fill in\r\nthe gaps left by earlier works on Montreal.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[1] One of the best known of Montreal dramatic writers was\r\nCharles Heavysege whose dramas of Saul, Count Felipo and Jeptha’s\r\nDaughter, published in the early ’60s, gave him an international\r\nreputation.\r\n\r\n[2] See the History of Montreal, Volume I Under the French\r\nRegime.

About 1834 the peculiar political crisis through\r\nwhich the country was passing turned the thoughts of the racial\r\nleaders of the various component parts of the city towards\r\nself-preservation. Politically there were the two camps, the\r\nAnglo-Saxon Community and the Franco-Canadians. Already there was\r\nin existence for the Anglo-Canadian party the “Constitutional\r\nAssociation,” but this was not felt to be adequate without the\r\nadditional strength of strictly national societies on patriotic\r\nlines. Hence the St. George’s, St. Patrick’s, St. Andrew’s\r\nand the German Societies were formed almost simultaneously.\r\nRacially the motive of self-preservation was stimulated by the\r\nnecessity of meeting the needs of the now increasing flow of\r\nimmigrants from their respective fatherlands, who looked for\r\nsome institution to give them a welcoming hand on reaching the\r\ncity. The association of St. Jean Baptiste representing French\r\nCanadian interests had the same dual object, fraternity and\r\nbenevolence, and the charters of all resemble one another very\r\nmuch in this last respect. Latterly other associations have been\r\nformed and cooperate in the welfare of the city. All of these\r\nassociations representing the diverse sections of the community,\r\nare in harmony with one another and preserve the principles of\r\n“Concordia Salus.”\r\n\r\n\r\n                    ST. JEAN BAPTISTE SOCIETY\r\n\r\nThe basis of the association of St. Jean Baptiste was laid by\r\nLudger Duvernay on June 24, 1834, in the critical period when\r\nthe seeds were being sown to fructify in the years of rebellion\r\nof 1837-38. The date named was the occasion of a banquet which\r\nwas held in Mr. John McDonnell’s garden on St. Antoine Street,\r\nunder the chairmanship of the Hon. Jacques Viger, then mayor\r\nof Montreal. The basis of a French Canadian National Society\r\nwas then laid. The ends of the society were to unite all French\r\nCanadians for fraternal purposes, for union, and for the\r\npromotion of the national and industrial interests of all French\r\nCanadians and the members of the Association in particular. The\r\nannual subscriptions were to be employed in works of beneficence,\r\nassisting members affected by adversity or sickness, and burying\r\nthose who died in poverty.\r\n\r\nThe sorrows of 1837 suspended the annual celebration of the\r\nnational fête and, owing to the exile of M. Ludger Duvernay\r\nand several of the others who had been proscribed, the work of\r\nreorganization did not recommence until the former’s return\r\nin 1842. On June 9, 1843, the first general assembly met\r\nfor reorganization in a hall in St. Ann’s market, under the\r\nchairmanship of the Hon. D.B. Viger, with George Etienne Cartier\r\nas secretary.\r\n\r\nThe city was divided into four sections for the operation of\r\ntheir works of beneficence. Each section was to have, subject\r\nto annual elections, three vice presidents, a treasurer, two\r\nsecretaries and four teachers. In addition the association was to\r\nhave the following officers elected annually: A president, four\r\nvice presidents, a treasurer, four secretaries, four teachers and\r\na “commissaire ordinateur.” The minutes of this meeting of 1843\r\nreveal the following elections:\r\n\r\n  1. Section de La Ville (embracing the limits of the city as then\r\n     known).\r\n       President: The Hon. D.B. Viger.\r\n       Vice Presidents: Joseph Roy, E.R. Fabre, James McGill\r\n         Desrivières, Jean Bruneau.\r\n       General Treasurer: Joseph Boulanger.\r\n       Secretaries: Joseph Belle, L.O. Lamoureux, M. Martel C. Roy.\r\n       Commissaire Ordonnateur: General manager, Ludger Duvernay.\r\n\r\n  2. Section St. Antoine (comprising St. Ann, St. Joseph and St.\r\n     Antoine suburbs and the adjoining districts).\r\n       Vice Presidents: John Donegani, E.M. Leprohon, O. Frechette.\r\n       Treasurer: Damase Masson.\r\n       Secretary: Agapit Morin.\r\n\r\n  3. Section St. Laurent (comprising the St. Lawrence suburb and\r\n     adjoining district).\r\n       Vice Presidents: Augustin Perrault, Joseph Vallée, Fleury\r\n         St. Jean.\r\n       Treasurer: Meneclier de Monochon.\r\n       Secretaries: A. Gauthier, M. Pommainville.\r\n\r\n  4. Ste. Marie (comprising the St. Louis and Quebec suburbs and\r\n     the adjoining districts).\r\n       Vice Presidents: L.M. Viger, Joseph Grenier, Pierre Damour.\r\n       Treasurer: Louis Boyer.\r\n       Secretaries: J.P.A. Poitras, C.A. Leblanc.\r\n\r\nIn addition a general committee was appointed for the association\r\nof the following: Joseph Bourret, C.S. Cherrier, B.H. LeMoyne,\r\nA.M. Deslisle, Jacques Viger, P. Beaubien, C.S. Rodier, G.E.\r\nCartier, J.D. Bernard, John Jordan, P. Lacombe, François Perrin,\r\nO. Berthelet, J.G. Barthe, A. Laframboise, John McDonnell, Louis\r\nComte, J.A. Berthelet, N. Dumas, J.A. Labadie, P. Jodoin, R.\r\nTrudeau, J.L. Beaudry, Hubert Lepage.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE OLD BANK OF MONTREAL. AFTERWARDS THE BANQUE\r\nDU PEUPLE. The above picture was taken in 1872 by W. Raphael and\r\nrepresents a St. Jean Baptiste procession. The “Flaxman” bas\r\nreliefs on the exterior are now inserted in the portion of the\r\npresent General Post Office, which marks the old site of the\r\nabove bank.]\r\n\r\nOn the 24th of June of the following year, 1844, the feast of St.\r\nJean Baptiste, the national fête, was celebrated in the manner\r\nnow customary, a solemn high mass at Notre Dame Parish Church was\r\nfollowed by an imposing procession and succeeded by patriotic\r\ndiscourses on love of country and brotherhood. The association\r\nhas continued with success to the present day.[1]\r\n\r\nSome of the developments of the association may be recorded.\r\n\r\nIn 1873 Mr. L.O. David took the lead in inviting the French\r\nNational Societies of Canada and the United States to join that\r\nof the St. Jean Baptiste Society at Montreal on the 24th of\r\nJune of 1874 in a striking demonstration. This was realized. It\r\nwas the occasion of many fruitful ideas for further development\r\nwhich were to bear fruit in time. Thus when there was question\r\nin 1884 of celebrating the fiftieth anniversary, Mr. L.O.\r\nDavid proposed the foundation of a national headquarters for\r\nFrench-Canadians. As a result land was bought for the purpose\r\nat the corner of Craig and Gosford streets, and the celebration\r\nof the 24th of June, 1884, included the laying of a foundation\r\nstone of the new building. Financial difficulties delayed further\r\nprogress, but in 1886 Dr. E.P. Lachapelle, the president, took\r\nup the project anew. In the following year Mr. L.O. David, who\r\nwas a member of the legislative assembly at Quebec, obtained a\r\nnew charter and prevailed upon the Mercier government to give\r\n$10,000 for the construction of the building. Further money was\r\nraised by bazaars, concerts and by shares, till the money reached\r\nthe round sum of $50,000. In 1890 the land on the present site\r\nof the “Monument National” was purchased on St. Lawrence Main\r\nStreet. The foundations of the edifice were laid in the spring\r\nof 1901 and the work was completed in 1903. The name desired by\r\nits founders was the “Académie Nationale,” but popular desire\r\ncentered on “Monument National” as the name which best expressed\r\nthe demonstration of the sentiment of French-Canadian patriotism\r\nunderlying the movement. Before completion, the cost of the\r\nbuilding, apart from the purchase money for the site, rose to\r\n$200,000. The resources of the financial committee and of the\r\ntwo treasurers of the association, MM. A.S. Hamelin and J.C.\r\nBeauchamp, were highly taxed for a long period. It will be seen\r\nthat in the early conception of the functions of the association\r\npopular education held a foremost part, hence the constitutions\r\nprovided for “Precépteurs.” The first move, therefore, was to\r\nestablish the public free courses in instruction which are\r\nmaintained today with such efficiency of development.\r\n\r\nThe following courses were first instituted: Mines and\r\nmetallurgy; industrial mechanics; architecture and building;\r\nelectricity; universal history; commerce; elocution; agriculture\r\nand colonization; and Grammaire Parlée. A dramatic section to\r\npromote a taste for the purity of French was early added and\r\nunder the name of “Soirée de famille” represented most of the\r\nmasterpieces of the French drama. These are now discontinued,\r\nthe movement being taken up elsewhere, but the courses have been\r\ncontinually improved and modernized to meet the requirements\r\nof the hour. The association has pioneered many progressive\r\neducational movements.\r\n\r\nAt present it is concentrating its attention on the amelioration\r\nof the social conditions of the French-Canadian population. In\r\n1912 it played a leading part in the organization of the very\r\nsuccessful Child Welfare exhibition, the first of its kind in\r\nCanada. The seal of the association “Rendre le peuple meilleur”\r\nindicates its national scope. The chief philanthropic work of\r\na national description, founded by the association about 1899,\r\nhas been the “Caisse Nationale d’Economie,” by which, through\r\nthe means of an annual subscription and slight monthly payments,\r\na system of old-age pensions or funds to meet emergencies of\r\ndisablement has been elaborated and has proved wonderfully\r\nsuccessful under the management of Mr. Arthur Gagnon.\r\n\r\nOutside the material and intellectual functions indicated, the\r\naim of the association has always been the preservation of the\r\nFrench-Canadian spirit. An extract from a speech delivered on\r\nthe occasion of a St. Jean Baptiste day celebration about 1901,\r\nby the Hon. Israël Tarte, then minister of public works, will\r\nindicate this: “This manifestation,” he said, “of our patriotism\r\ncannot surely cause umbrage to our fellow citizens of diverse\r\nnational origin surrounding us. Moreover our enemies are becoming\r\nscarcer. Today the assimilation of races is out of the question.\r\nNo one any longer dreams of it, for the assimilation would\r\ndeprive the country of a stimulus of the first importance, an\r\ninteresting characteristic. It would cause the healthy (_bien\r\nentendu_) rivalry to disappear between the two races in the\r\ndomain of study, the arts, commerce, industry and all that\r\nappertains to the intellectual and material advancement of our\r\nbeautiful country. I am a partisan of the union of hearts and\r\nminds for the development of our Canadian, fatherland. Whatever\r\nthe language we speak, whatever the altar we kneel at in prayer\r\nand adoration to God, we ought all to practice the cult of\r\ncountry. The English represent the genius of commerce, the art\r\nof making a fortune, the distinctive characteristics of the\r\nAnglo-Saxon race. We, on this continent, represent some of the\r\nvirtues which have distinguished the French race from all time,\r\ngenerosity, the love of _belles lettres_ and of good taste and\r\nGallic gaiety and enthusiasm which are the heritage of France and\r\nhave been the inspiring cause of so many noble actions inscribed\r\nin the annals of history.” In conclusion he said: “I know no\r\ncountry more beautiful than our own; I know no happier people in\r\nthe world than the French-Canadians: remain such! Let us proclaim\r\nit on high, for our race is the equal of any at present existing\r\nunder the sun. There is my last word.”\r\n\r\nThe original charter has been modified.\r\n\r\nIn 1903, on St. Jean Baptiste day, a national religious banner\r\nwas adopted, recalling the memories of Carillon. It has a blue\r\nbackground, _fleurdelisé_, and bearing a large white cross with\r\nthe emblem of the Sacred Heart in the middle of maple leaves.\r\nThis was prepared by the Rev. E. Filiatrault and adopted by\r\nmany of St. Jean Baptiste Association. It was a protest against\r\nthose who, while desiring a flag to recall their French origin\r\nand their national sentiments, had used the tri-colored flag\r\nof modern France _faute de mieux_, although the ideas conveyed\r\nby it did not represent the ancient regime under which the\r\nFrench-Canadians had sprung. The _fleur de lys_ of the past\r\nrepresents the sentiment of their descendants today, rather than\r\ndoes the modern tri-color.\r\n\r\nThe list of presidents contains many distinguished names.\r\n\r\n  1834      Jacques Viger\r\n  1843-44   Hon.

GEORGE’S NATIONAL SOCIETY\r\n\r\nSt. George’s National Society became such in 1834. But previously\r\nEnglishmen good and true had rallied together on St. George’s day\r\nyears before. The following account of a celebration in 1821 will\r\ntherefore be interesting:\r\n\r\n“Monday last being the day consecrated to the titular Saint\r\nof old England, and, what bestows on it nearly as great a\r\ndistinction, being that appointed for the celebration of our\r\nmost gracious Sovereign’s Nativity, a royal salute was at one\r\no’clock fired on the Champ de Mars by the troops in Garrison, and\r\na holiday was observed at both the Banks. (_Montreal Bank_, and\r\n_Bank of Canada_.)\r\n\r\n“In the evening, natives of the Mistress of the Ocean joined at\r\nthe Neptune Inn, when the evening was passed in social festivity\r\nin the expression of the loyal sentiments stamped in the bosom of\r\nevery Briton, in toasts to the prosperity of the British Empire,\r\nand to the happiness of the illustrious family at its head.\r\n\r\n“The dinner given at the Neptune Inn, kept by Geo. Casser,\r\nsituate at the corner of St. Joseph Street, (_now St. Sulpice_)\r\nopposite the Montreal Steamboat landing place, was an excellent\r\none provided for the occasion, to which the Sons of St. George,\r\nin large numbers, sat down precisely at 5 o’clock p. m.\r\n\r\n“The utmost harmony and decorum prevailed throughout. A\r\ntransparent painting ‘Combating the Dragon,’ done by Mr. Thomas\r\nHoney, was among the most conspicuous decorations of the room.\r\nIn the course of the evening, when the circling glass had\r\nexcited a high degree of hilarity, the gaiety of the moment was\r\nincreased by a few well-selected songs accompanied by appropriate\r\nand patriotic toasts, among which the following few were given\r\nand received with enthusiasm:--The King, God bless him; Queen\r\nCaroline; The Duke of York and the Royal Family; England and the\r\nDay we celebrate; Our worthy Governor, the Earl of Dalhousie;\r\nSir Peregrine Maitland and our Sister Province (_Upper Canada_);\r\nLady Dalhousie and the Canadian Fair; may the Rose, Thistle and\r\nShamrock ever entwine; the Duke of Wellington and the Army of\r\nGreat Britain; Capt. Byner and our Navy; Trade and prosperity\r\nto the Canadas; Colonel De Salaberry and the surviving heroes\r\nof Chateauguay; Colonel Burer and the Garrison of Montreal; May\r\nthe seeds of dissention never find growth in the soil of Great\r\nBritain; the immortal memory of Nelson (in silence); Colonel\r\nMorrison and the surviving heroes of Chrysler’s farm; Captain\r\nBroke and the surviving tars of the ‘Shannon’; the liberal heart\r\nthat gives, and the tender heart that forgives; may the sins of\r\nour forefathers descend upon our foes; firmness in the Senate,\r\nvalour in the field and fortitude on the waves; The Constitution\r\nof Great Britain--a pattern to the world.\r\n\r\n“At a late hour the company separated, highly gratified with\r\ntheir entertainment.”\r\n\r\nAlthough therefore Britishers had naturally, since the beginning\r\nof the English régime often combined, the St. George’s National\r\nSociety as such was also born at a time when racial feeling ran\r\nhigh, and preceded the rebellion of 1837, being founded in 1834.\r\nIts first quarterly meeting was held on January 10, 1835, with\r\na membership of forty-eight. On the cover of its first printed\r\nconstitution and by-laws it is stated that the society was\r\norganized in the city of Montreal for the purpose of relieving\r\nbrethren in distress, and in the introduction thereto feelings\r\nare expressed which indicate that the founders were indeed\r\nanimated by the keenest sympathies and sincerest desires to aid\r\nunfortunate English people in the city at the time, expressing\r\nsentiments of intense patriotism. In an original introduction,\r\ndated December 19, 1834, it can be seen that its intention was to\r\nuphold in Canada a union of Britons to cherish in the descendants\r\nof Englishmen, Scotchmen and Irishmen born in the colony their\r\nveneration for everything British and their attachment for\r\nBritish laws and British rule and of holding out the hand of\r\nwelcome and of brotherly love and charity to those numerous\r\nand frequently distressed countrymen whom the pressure of a\r\nsuperabundant population is annually forcing to emigrate to this\r\ndistant land.\r\n\r\nA pamphlet published in 1855 gives a list of the earliest\r\nofficers at the foundation of St. George’s Society as follows:\r\nPresident, Hon. George Moffatt; first vice president, George\r\nGregory, Esq.; second vice president, John Molson, Jr., Esq.;\r\ntreasurer, Frederick Griffin; secretary, Samuel Tubby; assistant\r\nsecretary, Arthur C.

By\r\n1856 it had a membership of 147 and in the year of incorporation,\r\n1861, it was increased to 170. During the presidency of Mr. John\r\nLeeming, 1867-8-9, the home on St. Antoine Street was built at\r\na cost of $14,000. The Society has steadily kept to its purpose\r\nas a national society and has treated the immigration question\r\ntheoretically and practically during its long career having\r\ndemonstrated beyond dispute that the society has lived up to its\r\noriginal principles. In 19--the Society purchased a new home\r\non Lagauchetière and Cathedral streets to meet the increasing\r\ndemands on its charitable usefulness. It has two days in the year\r\nespecially observed, that of Christmas eve, when a distribution\r\nof good things for the poor takes place, and that of April\r\n23d, the feast of St. George, when conviviality reigns at the\r\nannual banquet to which the official representative of the other\r\nNational Societies is invited.\r\n\r\nThe following gentlemen have served as president for the Society\r\nsince its formation:\r\n\r\n  1834-35-36-37  The Hon.

They early formed their Scotch\r\nchurch on St. Gabriel’s Street and were a distinct national\r\nfactor in the community, as the lists of names of the North West\r\nCompany will attest, but their National Association, St. Andrew’s\r\nSociety, arose thus:\r\n\r\nOn Monday, December 1, 1834, upwards of one hundred leading\r\nScotchmen met at the Albion Hotel in the rear of the theatre\r\nto celebrate St. Andrew’s day, the ecclesiastical feast having\r\nbeen celebrated on the Sabbath previously. During the dinner, in\r\nconsequence of strong national feeling, it was resolved to form a\r\nnational society for fraternity and benevolence. The stewards of\r\nthis meeting met on January 17th and a sub-committee of Messrs.\r\nAdam Ferrie, William Ritchie, William Edmonstone, Archibald Hume,\r\nRobert Armour, Jr., and William Wilson, Jr., was appointed to\r\ndraw up a constitution. That of St. Andrew’s Society of New York\r\nbecame the model. A general gathering of the Scotch of the town\r\nwas then called to attend a meeting in the North West building on\r\nSt. Gabriel Street on the 6th of February, 1835. The chair was\r\ntaken by the Hon. Peter McGill and a constitution was adopted. On\r\nMarch 9th a meeting was held in Mr. John Fisher’s premises on St.\r\nPaul Street, when the following office bearers were elected to\r\nserve till November 30, 1835: President, Hon. Peter McGill; first\r\nvice president, Adam Ferrie; second vice president, John Boston;\r\ntreasurer, Charles Tait; secretary, William Edmonstone; chairman\r\ncommittee of management, J. Redpath.\r\n\r\nThe members in the first year numbered nearly three hundred.\r\nOne of the first public acts of the association was to accept\r\nthe invitation of the German Society to march in procession\r\nwith them, and St. George’s and St. Patrick’s societies, to\r\nthe Protestant Episcopal church on August 3d, it being “their\r\nanniversary.”\r\n\r\nAt this time an arrangement was entered into by these four\r\nnational societies for a general procession on each national\r\nfestival day. At the anniversary meeting of November 30th, held\r\nin the morning, the Earl of Selkirk was, at his own request,\r\nproposed and elected a life member. The society, followed by the\r\nother national societies, then marched to St. Gabriel’s Church,\r\nwhere the sermon was preached by the Reverend Mr. Esson. In the\r\nevening the banquet took place at Rasco’s Hotel, when 150 members\r\nand guests dined together. The annual dinner and the public\r\nprocession of November 30, 1837, were omitted, this being the\r\nyear of the civil rebellion of which the first act took place\r\non November 6th, in the collision of “Fils de la Liberté” and\r\nthe British residents of Montreal. The members of St. Andrew’s\r\nSociety being all Loyalists, were immediately put under arms and\r\nperformed military duty. At the magistrates’ request that the\r\nusual procession should be omitted in the disturbed portion of\r\nthe country and in the excited state of the public mind, this was\r\ndone, but it was hoped to hold the annual dinner. This was also\r\nfound impossible, since on account of the regular military being\r\nwithdrawn from the city, most of the members were on guard. About\r\nthirty, however, made arrangements for supper, at Orr’s Hotel,\r\nwhich took place.\r\n\r\nAlthough another rebellion broke out on November 3, 1838, much\r\nless danger was anticipated, so the anniversary festival was\r\nobserved, both with a procession and the annual dinner, but\r\nafter the commencement of the rebellion of 1837 the custom of\r\nthe national association of joining in each other’s anniversary\r\nprocessions was discontinued.\r\n\r\nAt the quarterly meeting of February, 1839, the Right Reverend\r\nMr. McDonnell, Roman Catholic bishop of Kingston, was elected an\r\nhonorary member.\r\n\r\nIn 1841, the first opportunity was offered of assisting destitute\r\nScotchmen, outside the city. In September an application from Mr.\r\nMorris, president of the emigrant association of the district\r\nof St. Francis, applied for pecuniary aid for a body of 229\r\nutterly destitute immigrants recently arrived from the island of\r\nLewis (Scotland). A collection of £234 14s. 6d. was accordingly\r\nforwarded. The following year relief was granted to the Rev.\r\nJohn Taylor of Lachine to assist the Scotch immigrants who\r\nsurvived the very sad accident on Lake St. Louis when a small\r\nhigh pressure steamer, called the “Shamrock,” having burst her\r\nboiler shortly after leaving Lachine, sank almost immediately on\r\naccount of the force of the steam which blew the bow completely\r\nout of the boat. Another opportunity for developing their\r\ncharitable work was afforded in 1846 when, owing to the severity\r\nof this winter, a special collection was taken up to relieve\r\nthe necessities of the poor. The Society identified itself with\r\npublic movements thus:\r\n\r\nOn the 8th of August it took part on the Champ de Mars in the\r\ncelebration of the opening of the Atlantic Railway, and in 1847\r\nthe Society joined the other national societies in a procession\r\nin honour of the entry of the Earl of Elgin into Montreal as\r\ngovernor-general on the 29th of January.\r\n\r\nThe relations of St. Andrew’s with others of diverse national\r\norigin have always been cordial.\r\n\r\nOn the 11th of February resolutions were passed to open a\r\nsubscription for the destitute inhabitants of the Highlands\r\nof Scotland, while another read “that this meeting deeply\r\nsympathizes with the distress caused by famine in Ireland as\r\nwell as that affecting their own native land, and are ready to\r\nadmit that next to the claims of their own countrymen the poor\r\nof Ireland have the greatest right to consideration, yet in the\r\nbelief that more money will be raised by two separate committees\r\nthan by a united one, as proposed, they recommend that this\r\njunction be not entered into.”\r\n\r\nAt the annual banquet held at Donegana’s Hotel, among the guests\r\nwere the Hon. A.N. Morin, president of St. Jean Baptiste’s\r\nAssociation, His Worship, the Mayor, the Hon. Messrs. Molson and\r\nBadgeley, both past presidents of St. George’s Society, thus\r\nshowing that the racial hatchet was being buried.\r\n\r\nThe following record throws an interesting sidelight on the\r\npolitical state of the country and the keen interest which public\r\nevents evoked: In 1849, at a special meeting held April 28th,\r\nthree days after the signing of the Rebellion Losses bill by Lord\r\nElgin, under the presidency of Mr. Hugh Allan with seventy-one\r\nmembers present, Mr. Andrew McGill moved the following resolution\r\nwhich, having been seconded by Mr. Robert Esdaile, was put to the\r\nmeeting from the chair and unanimously adopted:\r\n\r\n“Resolved, That the Earl of Elgin, having so conducted himself\r\nas to insult and outrage the feelings of every British subject\r\nin Canada, and to disgrace the Scottish name, this society with\r\nthe deepest regret considers him unworthy to continue longer its\r\npatron and that he be, therefore, from henceforth, removed from\r\nthat office.”\r\n\r\nJohn Boston, Esq., having entered the room and finding that the\r\nprevious resolution had been carried, left the meeting. Mr.\r\nJohn Auld, seconded by Mr. George Macrae, moved the following\r\nresolution which was unanimously adopted:\r\n\r\n“Resolved, That the name of the Earl of Elgin be erased from the\r\nlist of honorary members of St. Andrew’s Society.”\r\n\r\nMr. E.P. Taylor, seconded by Mr. John Armour, submitted the\r\nfollowing resolution, which was also unanimously adopted:\r\n\r\n“Resolved, That the secretary be instructed to intimate the above\r\nresolutions to his Lordship.”\r\n\r\nIn preparation for the annual banquet of 1850 the office\r\nbearers resolved by a majority to omit from the list of toasts\r\n“the governor general.” In consequence as the presence of the\r\nband of the Twentieth Regiment had been previously sanctioned\r\nfor the occasion, its commander, Lieut.-Col. Frederick Horn,\r\ncountermanded the permission. At a subsequent meeting of office\r\nbearers it was resolved to place on the programme the toast of\r\nthe governor general, though the services of the band were not\r\nrequired. This year the annual banquet was held at Corse’s Hotel\r\non St. James Street, the governor general’s toast being received\r\nwith groans, hisses, reversing of glasses and other marks of\r\ndisapprobation. In 1851 a significant resolution proposed by Mr.\r\nEdmonstone and seconded by Mr. Alexander reads: “That those who\r\nhad left the society from conscientious scruples and who might\r\nwish to join again be readmitted without entrance fee.” This was\r\ncarried unanimously.\r\n\r\nNot only politics but religious matters were serious matters at\r\nthis period.\r\n\r\nA more pleasing incident is the following:\r\n\r\nAt a special meeting called on November 15, 1852, to consider\r\nwhat part the society should take in the approaching funeral\r\nsolemnities of the late Duke of Wellington, it was unanimously\r\nresolved:\r\n\r\n“That the St. Andrew’s Society as a society do proceed, with\r\ntheir banners and badges, with their brethren of St. George’s\r\nSociety to the Cathedral.”\r\n\r\nIn November, 1854, during the Crimean war, the Society raised\r\na subscription for the widows and orphans of those “who may\r\nfall during the present war.” Out of sympathy the annual social\r\ngathering was omitted, the amount to be devoted to the patriotic\r\nfund. This reached the sum of £305 15s. 2d. (equal to £372 0s.\r\n1d. currency).\r\n\r\nThe history of St. Andrew’s Home is now to be told.\r\n\r\nOn April 24, 1857, a committee reported that the experiment of\r\nmaintaining a home for emigrants and other homeless Scots had\r\nbeen successfully tried for six months in Hermine Street, a\r\nhouse having been rented for the purpose. The lease of a house\r\nwas taken on St. George Street for seven years. This home was\r\nopened on June 11th, Mr. Norman Macdonald being appointed the\r\nfirst superintendent. In the same month, the new St. Andrew’s\r\nHome received seventy-six of the survivors of the steamer\r\n“Montreal,” burned at the water’s edge opposite Cape Rouge on the\r\nway from Quebec, out of whose 450 passengers 320 were Scotch. A\r\nsubscription was raised by the committee of £1,182 5s. 11d. The\r\ndisaster caused deepest sympathy and cooperation in Montreal’s\r\never charitable circles. It was one of the disasters of this\r\nterrible year of 1857. The social event of the year was omitted\r\nand the money devoted to the enlargement of the home.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile other Scotch societies were growing up. On September 1,\r\n1858, the mayor having requested the different national societies\r\nin the city to join a procession to commemorate the successful\r\nlaying of the Atlantic telegraph cable, the Society marched to\r\nthe Champ de Mars, accompanied by the Caledonians and Thistle\r\nsocieties, which had grown up of recent years. The “Burns”\r\nSociety being then organized, it was agreed that the St. Andrew’s\r\nSociety should cooperate with it in the celebration of Burns’\r\ncentenary.\r\n\r\nThe next events chronologically are:\r\n\r\nIn 1859 the Society assisted the people of the townships of\r\nBruce and Kinloss, C.W., distressed by the failure of their\r\ncrops. On August 25, 1860, the society joined in the procession\r\nin honour of H.R.H. the Prince of Wales, on the occasion of his\r\narrival in Montreal. A committee of ladies was appointed on\r\nNovember 16, 1861, to cooperate with the charitable committee\r\nin the management of St. Andrew’s Home. The Hon. Mrs. Rollo was\r\nappointed its president. On December 1, 1862, the thanks of\r\nthe committee were given to Miss Edmonstone, of Scotland, for\r\ntwenty-five years’ supply of heather on St. Andrew’s day. On\r\nSeptember 22, 1863, the secretary was instructed to subscribe\r\n$25 to the funds of the House of Industry and Refuge, so as\r\nto secure for St. Andrew’s Society the privilege of electing\r\na representative in this governorship. Mr. J.C. Becket was so\r\nchosen. A committee was held on January 18, 1864, to confer with\r\nthe St. George’s and the Irish Protestant Benevolent Societies\r\nregarding a proposal to establish a United Protestant Immigration\r\nHome. In April, 1866, $2,000 having been subscribed for a St.\r\nAndrew’s Home on Dorchester Street, arrangements were made for\r\ncompleting the deed.\r\n\r\nSt. Andrew’s Society has wide sympathies, as the following will\r\nshow:\r\n\r\nIn April, 1868, at a special general meeting, the following\r\nresolutions, moved by T.K. Ramsay, seconded by Andrew Wilson,\r\nwere passed:\r\n\r\n“That the members of St. Andrew’s Society of Montreal have\r\nlearned with deep regret of the death of Hon. Thomas D’Arcy McGee\r\nby assassination.”\r\n\r\nMoved by Mr. McKay, seconded by A. McGibbon:\r\n\r\n“That the St. Andrew’s Society, feeling their deep obligation\r\nto the late T.D. McGee for his many acts of kindness, deem the\r\npresent a suitable occasion to acknowledge the same, as well\r\nas their utter abhorrence of the dastardly deed by which the\r\nDominion and the world have lost one of our most enlightened\r\nphilanthropic and able statesmen, our national and benevolent\r\nsocieties a liberal contributor and a respected family its loving\r\nand affectionate head, desire to mingle their sympathy with\r\nthe entire Dominion who mourn his death, and would offer the\r\nwidow and bereaved family cordial and deep sympathy for their\r\nirreparable loss.”\r\n\r\nMoved by Mr. McLennan, seconded by Mr. Burnett:\r\n\r\n“That in order to show the appreciation of this society of\r\nMr. McGee’s worth as a public man and a statesman, and their\r\ngratitude for the sympathy and assistance he extended to it on so\r\nmany occasions, it was resolved that this society do attend his\r\nfuneral in a body, wearing suitable mourning badges.”\r\n\r\nIn May, 1869, on the occasion of the departure from the city\r\nof the Seventy-eighth Highlanders, an address was presented\r\nto Lieutenant Colonel Mackenzie and his men. The St. Andrew’s\r\nSociety and the Caledonia Society, the latter having since its\r\nformation about 1855 been closely connected with the National\r\nSociety, sent addresses to England on the happy marriage of\r\nPrincess Louise Caroline Alberta with the Marquis of Lorne. On\r\nthe occasion of the destruction of St. Patrick’s Hall by fire\r\na resolution was passed on November 7th, sympathizing with St.\r\nPatrick’s Society.\r\n\r\nIn February, 1873, funeral of Sir George Etienne Cartier was\r\nattended by the body as a National Society. On November 2, 1876,\r\na resolution was passed “that the annual procession on St.\r\nAndrew’s day be discontinued.”\r\n\r\nThe history of “St. Andrew’s Ball” may now be told:\r\n\r\nIn 1878 the presence of the new governor general, the son of\r\nMacCallain More, His Excellency, the Marquis of Lorne, and his\r\nroyal consort, Princess Louise, was the occasion of a brilliant\r\nball on St. Andrew’s day in the Windsor Hotel. As the annual St.\r\nAndrew’s ball has become one of the great social events of the\r\ncity we may chronicle that the first quadrille was formed as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n  His Excellency and Lady Macdonald,\r\n  Lieutenant-Colonel Stevenson and H.R.H. the Princess,\r\n  Captain Charter, A.D.C., and Lady Sophia MacNamara,\r\n  Hon. T. Harbord, A.D.C., and Hon. Mrs. Moreton,\r\n  Colonel McNeil and Miss Dow,\r\n  Hon. M. Moreton and Miss Gordon,\r\n  Mr. Hector Mackenzie and Mrs. Daglish,\r\n  Mr. McCrae, Q.C., and Mrs. Hickson,\r\n  Mr. J. Johnson and Mrs. Ewing,\r\n  Hugh McKay and Mrs. Rose.\r\n\r\nThe Scotch reel was then danced by His Excellency and Miss\r\nOgilvie and afterwards with Miss McGibbon, while the Princess\r\ndanced the reel with Mr. Ewan McLennan, the president. The ladies\r\nwho had the honor of dancing with His Excellency were: Lady\r\nMacdonald, Miss Ogilvie, Miss Allan, Miss Greenshields, Miss\r\nCampbell, Miss McFarlane, Miss Robertson and Miss McGibbon.\r\n\r\nIn 1881 the Society adopted a revised constitution. In 1883\r\nan address was presented to His Excellency, the Marquis of\r\nLansdowne, Governor-General, on his first visit to Montreal.\r\nThe year 1887 saw the completion of the purchase of the Gould\r\nproperty on Mountain Street from the Canadian Pacific Railway\r\nCompany for $22,500, as the site of the new St. Andrew’s Home.\r\nThe same year an address was presented for the Society to Queen\r\nVictoria on her Jubilee by the Reverend Dr. Barclay, who had the\r\nhonour to be commanded to preach at Balmoral on June 12th. As Her\r\nMajesty was ill the petition was presented through the ordinary\r\nofficial channel. On September 28, 1893, an address of welcome\r\nwas presented to the governor general, Lord Aberdeen, and Lady\r\nAberdeen on the occasion of their first visit to the city. St.\r\nAndrew’s day, 1895, saw a return after twelve years to the\r\nbanquet instead of the annual ball. In 1896 McDonald Campbell,\r\nthe chairman of the charitable committee, died, having been\r\npreceded in 1895 by the decease of his wife. For over a quarter\r\nof a century these two had faithfully managed the “Home.” The\r\nannual ball was revived in 1896.\r\n\r\nThe death of Queen Victoria in January, 1901, caused the loyal\r\nScots of Montreal to send a resolution of sympathy to His\r\nMajesty, Edward VII. On the occasion of the official visit of\r\ntheir Royal Highnesses the Duke and Duchess of Cornwall to\r\nthe city in the fall of the same year, the Society erected a\r\ngrandstand and a triumphal arch in the Scottish baronial style.\r\nIn June, 1902, an address was forwarded to King Edward on the\r\noccasion of his coronation. At the annual ball the governor\r\ngeneral, Lord Minto, and the Countess of Minto were present.\r\n\r\nDuring the last decade the Society has continued to carry on its\r\nvarious works and public functions so happily inaugurated as\r\ndescribed.\r\n\r\nThe past presidents of St. Andrew’s Society have been:\r\n\r\n  1835-41    Hon. Peter McGill\r\n  1841-43    Sheriff John Boston\r\n  1844-45    Hon. Peter McGill\r\n  1846       Hon. William Morris\r\n  1847       Hon.

John Rose (afterwards Sir John Rose, Bart.)\r\n  1855-56    William Murray\r\n  1857-58    Alexander Morris\r\n  1859-60    John Greenshields\r\n  1861       David Brown\r\n  1862-63    Hon.

Ogilvie, M.P.P.\r\n  1871-72    Alexander McGibbon\r\n  1873-74    Sir Alexander T. Galt\r\n  1875       David Mackay\r\n  1876-77    Ewan McLennan\r\n  1879       Lieut.-Col. A.A.

Ogilvie\r\n  1885-86    Hugh McLennan\r\n  1887-88    R.B. Angus\r\n  1889-90    Sir Donald A. Smith (afterwards Lord Strathcona\r\n                and Mount Royal, G.C.M.G.)\r\n  1891-92    Duncan McIntyre\r\n  1893-94    Hon. Robert Mackay\r\n  1895-96    Donald Macmaster, K.C. (M.P. England)\r\n  1897-98    Hugh Paton\r\n  1899-1900  James Stewart, M.P.\r\n  1901-02    A.F. Riddell\r\n  1903       Principal William Peterson, C.M.G.\r\n  1904-06    W.M. Ramsay\r\n  1907-08    Charles Cassils\r\n  1909-10    Lieut.-Col. Robert Gardner\r\n  1911-12    Sir Hugh Montagu Allan, C.V.O.\r\n  1913       Farquhar Robertson (present president)\r\n\r\n\r\n                      ST. PATRICK’S SOCIETY\r\n\r\nSt. Patrick’s Society was originally organized in 1834 as a\r\nsociety for benevolent and national purposes and included\r\nIrishmen of all religious denominations. At the time of its\r\nformation Irishmen were beginning to be a force in the community\r\nand the mention of the names of J. Holmes, William Workman, and\r\nSir Francis Hincks bears this out.\r\n\r\nThe records of the transactions of this period until 1856 and\r\nlong after are not to be found, but other information of the year\r\n1856 is ample and enables us to trace the separation of the joint\r\nassociation into two, the St. Patrick’s Society of today and the\r\nIrish Protestant Benevolent Association.\r\n\r\nThe events leading to the reorganization of St. Patrick’s Society\r\nare as follows:\r\n\r\nOn February 12, 1856, a special meeting of the Society was held\r\nat St. Patrick’s Hall to consider the propriety of dissolving\r\nthe Society. This was to allow an amalgamation of the Catholic\r\nportion of the original St. Patrick’s Society with the Catholic\r\nHibernian Association, thus forming a new St. Patrick’s Society\r\nand to allow the Protestant members of the original St. Patrick’s\r\nto form one of their own which, in fact, they did, now known\r\nas the Irish Protestant Benevolent Society. After a series of\r\nresolutions in which there was recognition paid to the fact\r\nthat the St. Patrick’s Society of Montreal, since it foundation\r\nin 1834, had carried out its prime objects according to its\r\nconstitution, and recognizing that there was a move to allow\r\nthe formation of other societies which would “embrace elements”\r\nnow divided and in which jealous feelings would be extinguished\r\namidst conflicting opinions and opposing parties among the Irish\r\ninhabitants of this city, it was moved by Mr. James Flynn and\r\nseconded by John McCloskey, that consequently this society do now\r\ndecide to dissolve unequivocally and unreservedly and that on\r\nthe termination of the proceedings this Society do adjourn _sine\r\ndie_. The motion so moved was carried; and an acknowledgement\r\nmade of the services of W.P. Bartley, Esq., for his conduct as\r\npresident during the last two years.\r\n\r\nShowing how easy was transition from one side to the other, it\r\nwas moved by James Donnelly and Francis Dolan, recommending “that\r\nthe paying members of this Society be admitted into the new\r\norganization without initiation fees,” and the resolution further\r\nexpressed a hope that from the dissolution of the present may\r\nspring the germ of life of another organization on such a basis\r\nthat sectional and petty rivalries may be merged.\r\n\r\nIt is pleasing to note that ever since the separation of St.\r\nPatrick’s Society into the two component parts, St. Patrick’s\r\nSociety and the Irish Benevolent Society, there has never been\r\nany rift.\r\n\r\nThe first officers after reorganization in 1856 were: Henry\r\nHoward, president; Hon. Marcus Doherty, first vice president;\r\nThomas McGrath, second vice president; James E. Mullins,\r\ntreasurer; James Daly, corresponding secretary; Thomas C.\r\nCollins, recording secretary; W. Wallace O’Brien, assistant\r\nrecording secretary; John McDonald, chief marshal; Rev. J.J.\r\nConnolly, P.P., chaplain.\r\n\r\nThe early minutes of St. Patrick’s Society having been burnt\r\nin the fires of St. Patrick’s Hall in 1872 we find from other\r\nsources that the new St. Patrick’s Society held its first soirée\r\nat the latter end of 1856 with the National Benevolent Societies\r\npresent; it was followed by dancing to an advanced hour. The\r\npresident was then Doctor Howard.\r\n\r\nA meeting was held, February 8, 1857, in the Bishop’s Chapel\r\nof the Catholic citizens with the Catholic societies present,\r\nwhen it was moved by Doctor Howard, president of St. Patrick’s\r\nSociety, and seconded by Mr. John Kelly, to the effect that “in\r\norder that the new cathedral may be a monument worthy of the size\r\nand wealth of this extensive diocese it should be built so as\r\nto meet not only the wants of the diocese, but those which may\r\narise in the future from the rapid and constant increase of the\r\npopulation, both of the city and rural districts.”\r\n\r\nOn March 17, 1857, at John O’Meara’s Hotel, the first anniversary\r\ndinner was held. Presidents of numerous national societies and\r\nrepresentatives of the city press were guests. The Hon. Mr.\r\nMarcus Doherty was in the chair. The following toasts were\r\nproposed: “The Day and All Who Honour It,” “The Pope,” “The\r\nQueen,” “The Emperor of France,” “The President of the United\r\nStates,” “The Preacher of the Day,” “The Army and Navy, as\r\nComposed of Saxon and Celt,” “Irishmen at Home and Abroad,” “The\r\nMemory of Father Matthew,” “The Memory of O’Connell,” “The Mayor\r\nand Corporations,” “The National Association,” “The Press,”\r\nand finally “The Ladies.” Between the toast to the President\r\nof the United States and the Preacher of the Day the health\r\nof the Governor General was proposed and drunk by some of the\r\nparty present, the “Orange” governor, Sir Edward Head, not being\r\npopular.\r\n\r\nThese were days of bitter animosities which a wiser generation\r\nhas drowned.\r\n\r\nOn June 14, 1857, at the Corpus Christi procession, citizens,\r\nsoldiers of Captains Devlin’s, Bartley’s, Bell’s and Latour’s\r\nVolunteer Montreal Rifles Companies, marched with St. Patrick’s\r\nSociety and St. Jean Baptiste Society.\r\n\r\nThis was opposed by the Montreal Witness, but answered by the\r\nTrue Witness that it was the custom enjoyed by the French\r\nsubjects and its legality had been formally recognized by the\r\nBritish government, which till a few years ago furnished in the\r\npersons of its soldiers a Guard of Honour for the procession.\r\nThis is interesting in view of the recent attempt at disallowing\r\nthe Sixty-fifth Regiment of Militia from continuing the\r\ntime-honoured custom.\r\n\r\nOn December 1, 1857, a public meeting of Irish Catholics was held\r\nfor the election of an Irish representative, being the first\r\nmovement for such. Doctor Howard took the chair. Marcus Doherty,\r\nEsq., barrister, moved that the Irish, according to the last\r\ncensus, were entitled to name one of the three members allowed by\r\nlaw to represent this city in parliament. He was seconded by P.\r\nRonayne. Barney Devlin, Esq., barrister, moved “as the unanimous\r\nsense of this meeting Thomas D’Arcy McGee, Esq., be requested\r\nto allow himself to be put in nomination as our candidate for\r\nMontreal in the approaching contest.” Seconded by Mr. Lanigan.\r\nMr. McGee who had been brought to the city some time before for\r\nthis purpose and had fulfilled the conditions of domicile was\r\nthen brought into the room and introduced to the chairman as “our\r\ncandidate.” Mr. McGee responded with wit and humour and sagacity\r\nand was most vociferously cheered. A resolution was moved by\r\nMr. James Sadlier to form a committee to work the wards for the\r\nelection, which was seconded by Mr. Henry Kavanagh. Mr. Henry\r\nKavanagh was next called to the chair and a vote of thanks was\r\nmoved to Doctor Howard for his able conduct therein. Seconded by\r\nMr. McGee. The meeting then separated. “On reaching the street\r\nthey made the welkin ring three times three cheers for ‘our\r\ncandidate.’” Mr. McGee as told elsewhere was elected.\r\n\r\nIn later contests he was to be opposed by his proposer, Mr.\r\nDevlin, the lively remembrances of which still live.\r\n\r\nThe True Witness on June 12, 1857, announced an emigrant agency\r\nfor St. Patrick’s Society opened at 35 Common Street under\r\nDoctor McKeon. This work had interested the Society for many\r\nyears. Hence it is also that it took great interest in the\r\nestablishment of St. Bridget’s Home and St. Patrick’s Orphanage\r\nand other similar charities.\r\n\r\nThe meeting place of St. Patrick’s Society, according to an\r\nadvertisement of September 18, 1857, was the new hall on Place\r\nd’Armes Hill. The next move was to a hall over Donnelly and\r\nO’Brien’s store at the corner of McGill and Recollet streets,\r\nwith the entrance on Recollet (N). This meeting was on May 3,\r\n1858.\r\n\r\nThe next meeting place was a room in Bonaventure Hall, built at\r\nthe northwest corner of St. James Street and Victoria Square,\r\nfacing the Square. When this building was remodeled under the\r\nname of St. James Hotel[2] the Society remained there.\r\n\r\nThe Coffee House at the northeast corner of Craig and St.\r\nAlexander streets was then the meeting place until the new St.\r\nPatrick’s Hall was erected at the corner of Craig and McGill\r\nstreets, facing Victoria Square and bounded on the north by\r\nFortification Lane. It was a large and handsome building. The\r\nfoundation stone was laid on March 18, 1867, and in it was placed\r\na plate[3] recording the event as follows:\r\n\r\n  The Revd. P. Dowd, chief pastor of St. Patrick’s Church, on the\r\n  18th of March, 1867, in the 30th year of the reign of her Most\r\n  Gracious Majesty,\r\n\r\n                         Queen Victoria.\r\n\r\n  The Rt. Hon. Charles Stanley Viscount Monck, Baron Monck\r\n  of Balling Trimmon, Governor-General of British America,\r\n  Lieutenant-General Sir J. Michel, Bart., K.C.B., Commander of the\r\n  Forces. Administrator of the Government of Canada, Henry Starns,\r\n  commissioner of Montreal.\r\n\r\n  DIRECTORS (Ab Initio)\r\n\r\n  Bernard Devlin, Hon. T.D. McGee, Hon. Thos. Ryan, W.H. Hingston,\r\n  M.D., M.P. Ryan, Edward Murphy, J.W. McGovern, Luke Moore, C.J.\r\n  Cusack, Neil Shannon, J.W. Hopkins, architect, Howley & Sheriden,\r\n  builders, E.J. Gilbert, iron founder, etc.\r\n\r\n  “Then praise to the Highest, in the Height and in the Depth be\r\n  Praised.”\r\n\r\nThis fine building met with disaster, its roof fell in shortly\r\nafterward and finally it was burned down on October 2, 1872,\r\nafter which the affairs of St. Patrick’s Hall Association were\r\nwound up and left the stockholders with 55% of their shares. In\r\n1863 it was incorporated, its charter in part running as follows:\r\n\r\n   “WHEREAS, Thomas McKenna, Edw. McKeown, Dennis Downey, Wm.\r\n   P. McGuire, J.J. Curran, Patrick O’Meara, M. Cuddihy, Daniel\r\n   Lyons, P. Jordan, John H. Duggan, F.B. McNamee, O.J. Devlin,\r\n   A. Brogan, Richard McShane, P. Mullin, J.E. Mullin, B. Devlin,\r\n   Wm. Mansfield, M. Doherty and others have by their petition to\r\n   the legislature represented that the Society of which they are\r\n   members, known as the ‘St. Patrick’s Society of Montreal,’ has\r\n   for many years been organized for benevolent and other purposes,\r\n   and\r\n\r\n   “WHEREAS, They have prayed by the said petition that for the\r\n   better attainment of the object of the said Society it may\r\n   be invested with corporate powers, and by reason of the good\r\n   effected by the said Society it is expedient to grant the prayer\r\n   of the said petition;\r\n\r\n   “THEREFORE Her Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the\r\n   legislative council and assembly of Canada, enact as follows:”\r\n\r\nSince this time St. Patrick’s Society has carried on its good\r\nwork, but it has never had a permanent building of its own. It\r\nhas continued its interest in Irish charities, caring for orphans\r\nand immigrants. It has watched over the fortunes of Irishmen\r\nin civic, provincial and federal life and has always promoted\r\nHome Rule for Ireland. On April 24, 1893, St. Patrick’s Society\r\ntelegraphed, through the Hon. Edward Blake, then a member of\r\nthe English Parliament, congratulations to Mr. William Ewart\r\nGladstone and himself on the second reading of the bill. Of\r\nrecent years its activities in this line of similar promotion\r\nof their national cause have been great. Their annual dinner\r\non St. Patrick’s day has seen the presence of some of the most\r\ndistinguished Irish orators from Ireland and the American\r\nContinent.\r\n\r\nThe past presidents of the Society have been:\r\n\r\n  1856-57           Henry Howard, M.D.\r\n  1858-59           Hon. Marcus Doherty, J.S.C.\r\n  1860-61           Hon. Edward Murphy\r\n  1862-63           James A. Sadlier\r\n  1864              Thos.

Kennedy\r\n\r\n\r\n               IRISH PROTESTANT BENEVOLENT SOCIETY\r\n\r\nThe Irish Protestant Benevolent Society of Montreal was formed\r\nin 1856, after having separated from the joint St. Patrick’s\r\nSociety. In that year an act of incorporation was granted, on\r\nMarch 18th, on the petition of a certain number of petitioners\r\n“and others of Irish birth or extraction, residents of Montreal\r\n(who) have maintained by voluntary contributions a certain\r\ncharitable association whereof they are members, for the relief\r\nof distressed immigrants and others from Ireland or of Irish\r\ndescent, under the name of the Irish Protestant Benevolent\r\nSociety of Montreal.”\r\n\r\nThe incorporators’ names appended are James L. Mathewson,\r\nWilliam A. Merry, W.H. Gault, Hugh Mathewson, George Horne,\r\nGeorge Armstrong, William Rodden, Richard Holland, J.J. Arnton,\r\nCampbell Bryson, William Clendenning, George S. Scott, Robert\r\nMiller, William Middleton, James Parker, Richard Thomas, W.S.\r\nDavenport, Howard Ransom, John Shinnick, Thomas Workman, William\r\nMcWalters, the Rev. John Cordner, the Rev. John Irwin, Dr.\r\nRobert L. Macdonell, Dr. John Reddy, Dr. William P. Howard,\r\netc. The Society was instituted to advance the welfare of\r\nIrish Protestants in Canada, to afford advice, information\r\nand assistance to those immigrating hither, to promote their\r\nsettlement within the province, to protect their widows and\r\norphans and to afford pecuniary aid to those in need.\r\n\r\nA great work has been the maintenance of the Irish Protestant\r\nBenevolent Home in Belmont Park. Its activities along Irish\r\npatriotic lines have also been similar to those of St. Patrick’s\r\nSociety.\r\n\r\nThe presidents of the Society since its formation have been as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n  1856         *Benjamin Workman, M.D.\r\n  1857-59      *Hugh Mathewson\r\n  1859-61      *R.D.

Gilday, M.D.\r\n\r\n  * Deceased.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       THE GERMAN SOCIETY\r\n\r\nOf the other societies the German Society is the oldest, being\r\ncontemporaneous in its birth with the former. A consultation\r\nof the lists of citizens at this early period will show that\r\nthe German community then had some very notable names among its\r\nmembers.\r\n\r\nThe German Society was started in April, 1835, for the purpose\r\nof assisting poor German immigrants, without regard to creed,\r\nin order to prevent them from being a charge to the community;\r\nit has also often assisted Austrian, Swiss, Russian and other\r\nimmigrants of German descent. It is a purely benevolent\r\nassociation, being supported entirely by voluntary contributions.\r\n\r\nIts presidents since 1835 have been:\r\n\r\n  1835-39         Louis Gugy\r\n  1839-49         Dr. Daniel Arnoldi\r\n  1849-55         Heinrich Meyer\r\n  1855-58         Ernst Idler\r\n  1859-60         Gottlieb Reinhardt\r\n  1860-65         Gerhard Lomer\r\n  1865-66         Heinrich Drescher\r\n  1866-67, 70-73  Emanuel Häusgen\r\n  1867-70         Wilhelm Wagner\r\n  1873-77, 81-93  Wilhelm C. Munderloh\r\n  1877-81         Freidrich Geriken\r\n  1893            Eugen von Rappard\r\n  1893            *Edward Schultze\r\n\r\n  * Still in office.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    ST. DAVID’S WELSH SOCIETY\r\n\r\nIt was about the years 1884-5, that the first society to weld\r\ntogether the various members of the Welsh Colony of Montreal was\r\nestablished, and the moving spirit in this matter, was the late\r\nMr. Jabez Jones, a native of Mold, Flintshire, North Wales, an\r\nenergetic and enterprising organizer.\r\n\r\nThe society was called the “Welsh Union of Montreal.” Its first\r\npresident was the late Mr. John Lewis, surveyor of customs, for\r\nthe port of Montreal. He continued to fill the office until his\r\ndeath, and, with his distinguished and delightful personality and\r\nsupport, helped materially to make it a success.\r\n\r\nThe first vice-president, was the late Mr. Thomas Harries, who at\r\nthe time was the senior commercial traveller in Canada, a man of\r\nstrong convictions and noble character.\r\n\r\nThe nature of the Society in its early years was largely\r\nreligious and most of its gatherings were held on Sundays. Its\r\nrooms were in the old Y.M.C.A. Building on Victoria Square.\r\nThis edifice was considered one of the landmarks both for\r\narchitectural beauty and position among the great buildings of\r\nthe city in those days. The Society justified its existence\r\nin many ways, and proved a necessary and helpful anchorage,\r\nparticularly in bringing together the sons and daughters of\r\nWales, more especially at such times as the Patron’s Saint Day,\r\nan event of importance, and a day dear to the Welshman’s heart,\r\nall over the world, known as “St. David’s Day,” always held on\r\nthe first day of March; the time of the “Congresses of Bards and\r\nContests of Minstrels,” and the feast day of one of the guardians\r\nof the nation’s ideals and inspirer of its genius.\r\n\r\nHowever, the element of decay entered into the vitals of the old\r\nSociety and it ceased to exist for some time.\r\n\r\nAbout twelve years ago, the present Welsh Society was founded,\r\nknown as the “St. David’s Welsh Society.” It was incorporated in\r\n1910 on a far broader basis than the old Society. Its aims are,\r\nthe bringing together of men and women of Welsh parentage or\r\nassociated by marriage with Welsh people, to create an interest\r\nin the study of Welsh music, literature, folklore, poetry and all\r\nsubjects of interest to the race and a culture of a true Canadian\r\nnationality among the descendants of this ancient and historic\r\npeople.\r\n\r\nThe honorary president since its inception, with the exception of\r\none year, is Mr. Lansing Lewis, D.C.L., a son of the president of\r\nthe old Welsh Union, the exception being the year the late Mr.\r\nSamuel Carsley held the office.\r\n\r\nThe first president was Mr. Richard Roberts, L. Mus., the first\r\nvice president, Mr. James Kirkham (Iago Tegai), the latter, in\r\nconsort with Mr. Evan Jones and Mr. Jos. Jenkins, B.A., being\r\namong the most important moving spirits in the organization of\r\nthe Society.\r\n\r\nThe following gentlemen filled the position of president:\r\n\r\nMr. Evan Jones, Mr. Jos. Jenkins, B.A., B.C.L., Mr. M.E.\r\nPritchard, Mr. W.G. Bithell, and the present holder of the\r\nposition is Mr. Wm. Evans, merchant.\r\n\r\nThe Welsh people are renowned for their intense patriotism and\r\nloyalty, and by training and temperament make good citizens,\r\ninvariably lending their influence and support to every effort to\r\nadvance the interests of the cities and towns wherein they may\r\nchance to reside and it is estimated that there are in Montreal,\r\nat the present time, from one to two thousand Welsh people.\r\nSome of them are large employers of Canadian labor, and the\r\nmajority of them are interested in the manifold forces at work\r\nof beautifying and making known the varied advantages, present\r\nand prospective of this regal and beautiful metropolis of the\r\nDominion of Canada.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    THE NEWFOUNDLAND SOCIETY\r\n\r\nThe youngest National Society formed on lines similar to the\r\nforegoing was founded in September, 1911.\r\n\r\nIts presidents have been as follows:\r\n\r\n  1911-12 F.M. Renouf\r\n  1913    C.A. Peters, M.D.\r\n  1914    W.A. Gaden\r\n\r\nThe object of the Society was to encourage Newfoundlanders\r\nwho were migrating to other lands to settle in Canada under\r\nthe British flag and to welcome them when in the city with\r\ninformation to enable them to succeed here.\r\n\r\nA great opportunity offered itself to the members in 1914, when\r\non the occasion of the great Newfoundland sealing disaster in\r\nMarch of that year, it organized a relief fund in the city\r\nand realized a sum of $13,000, which was forwarded to the\r\nNewfoundland Government.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      THE ZIONIST MOVEMENT\r\n\r\nThe Jewish community, whose earliest settlers and prominent\r\ncitizens will be noticed elsewhere, has not been regarded as\r\npossessing a national society as such, although the Baron de\r\nHirsch Institute, now long founded, has been the centre of\r\ncharitable activities for Jewish immigrants. Of late years,\r\nhowever, there has arisen a movement which may have a place here.\r\n\r\nMontreal is the head centre of the Zionist Movement in the\r\nDominion, and the executive offices of the Federation of Zionist\r\nSocieties of Canada are situated in this city. No Jewish body in\r\nthis country counts as large a membership or is as thoroughly\r\nrepresentative of the entire Jewish population of Canada as\r\nthe Zionist Movement, for it has its branches in every city,\r\ntown and village from the Atlantic to the Pacific. The first\r\nZionist society was founded in Montreal in January, 1898. Among\r\nits founders were Clarence I. de Sola, Rev. A. Ashinsky, H.\r\nBernstein, L. Aronson, Lazarus Cohen, Jacob Cohen, Leon Goldman,\r\nJ.S. Leo, Rev. Meldola de Sola, Dr. D.A. Hart and Moses Shapiro.\r\nFrom small beginnings this movement, having for its object the\r\nre-establishment of the Hebrew nation in Palestine, spread with\r\nphenomenal rapidity, and within one year from its foundation\r\nso numerous had the branches become that they were formed into\r\na federation under a central federal executive. This was in\r\nDecember, 1899. The enormous strides which the organization has\r\nmade is shown in its ever-increasing revenue and membership from\r\nyear to year. Its conventions have become one of the striking\r\nevents of Jewish communal life in this country. At the eleventh\r\nconvention, held in Toronto in December, 1910, the Canadian\r\nZionist Federation started the undertaking of establishing a\r\nJewish agricultural colony in Palestine with funds entirely\r\ncontributed by members of the movement in Canada. This enterprise\r\nwas carried through so successfully that at the thirteenth\r\nconvention, held in Montreal in 1913, the president was able to\r\nannounce that the establishment of the first colony had been\r\ncompleted and the work of establishing a second colony was\r\nbegun. This convention was also rendered noteworthy by President\r\nde Sola’s plea for the restoration of the Jewish Sanhedrin in\r\nPalestine, a plea which attracted world-wide notice and received\r\nthe approval of many of the leading Jews throughout the world.\r\nThe present executive of the Zionist Federation counts among\r\nits officers some of the most capable and active workers in the\r\nJewish community of Canada. To mention them all would entail the\r\ngiving of a long list, but among the Montrealers, in addition to\r\nthose already mentioned above, are A. Levin, who is treasurer; M.\r\nMarkus, Rev. Nathan Gordon, Rev. H. Abramowitz, Joseph Fineberg,\r\nL. Heillig, Mrs. Clarence de Sola, Mrs. J.S. Leo, and H. Lang.\r\n\r\n  The first Jew known to have settled in Montreal was Lazarus\r\n  David, who came to this city in 1759. He was connected with the\r\n  army, but on the close of the war settled in Montreal and became\r\n  an extensive owner of real estate. He was a man of public spirit\r\n  who took a prominent part in civic affairs in those early days.\r\n  He was born in Swansea, Wales, in 1734 and his name appears in\r\n  a list of residents published in Montreal in 1763. He continued\r\n  to play a prominent part, in what was then but a little town,\r\n  until his death on the 22d of October, 1776, and the headstone\r\n  which marks the place of his interment is still to be seen in\r\n  the cemetery of the Spanish and Portuguese Jews on Mount Royal.\r\n  Very shortly after the arrival of Lazarus David there also\r\n  came to Montreal Uriah Judah and other members of the Judah\r\n  family, Emanuel de Cordova, Hananiel Garcia, Isaac Miranda,\r\n  Judah Elvada, Uriel Moresco, Abraham Franks, Simon Levy, Levy\r\n  Solomons and Fernandez da Fonseca. They were joined by another\r\n  band of settlers, among whom were included Abram Franks, David\r\n  Salesby Franks, Isaac Miranda, Jacob de Maurera, Andrew Hays,\r\n  Levy Solomons and Joseph Bindona. De Cordova, Garcia and Miranda\r\n  held military offices. Nearly all of these men belonged to\r\n  distinguished families of Jews who had come to America originally\r\n  from Spain and Portugal and known among the Hebrews as Sephardin\r\n  and were members of the first Jewish Synagogue.\r\n\r\n  Although the members of this congregation were in those days but\r\n  small in number, they produced a remarkably large number of men\r\n  who took a very prominent part in public affairs. At the time\r\n  that Lazarus David was settling in Montreal there had arrived in\r\n  Canada Commissary General Aaron Hart, who was on the staff of\r\n  General Amherst’s invading army and who took an important part\r\n  in the operations which led to the British Conquest. He was born\r\n  in London in 1724 and had married a member of the Judah family,\r\n  and after serving under Amherst he afterwards joined the troops\r\n  under General Haldimand, stationed at Three Rivers, and when that\r\n  city fell into the hands of the British he took up his residence\r\n  there. After the war he was created seigneur of Bécancour for his\r\n  services, and became the owner of six other seigneuries. Another\r\n  man of prominence was David Salesby Franks. He and his father,\r\n  Abraham Franks, first appear as residents of Quebec in 1767 and\r\n  afterwards they settled in Montreal. David Salesby Franks was\r\n  president of the Spanish and Portuguese Synagogue previous to\r\n  1775. He agitated for the establishment of a House of Assembly\r\n  and the establishment of representative government in Canada.\r\n  Business affairs, however, drew him to Philadelphia and New York\r\n  and when the American Revolutionary War broke out he espoused the\r\n  cause of the American colonists and became major of a regiment.\r\n  In May, 1778, he became aide-de-camp to Major Benedict Arnold.\r\n  When in 1780 the affair of West Point occurred and Arnold fled\r\n  to escape punishment for his treason to the Revolutionary cause,\r\n  Major Franks was arrested on suspicion and courtmartialed, but\r\n  was honourably acquitted and was afterwards placed on the staff\r\n  of George Washington, under whom he fought during the rest of\r\n  the war. He played a prominent part in the negotiations for\r\n  peace between the American colonists and Great Britain and was\r\n  sent on a mission in this connection to Europe in 1781, and in\r\n  1784 he was again sent to Europe by the United States Congress\r\n  with the triplicate copies for the ratification of the definite\r\n  treaty of peace. He assisted Benjamin Franklin and Mr. Jay in\r\n  these negotiations. He was afterwards appointed American consul\r\n  at Marseilles and he was one of the commissioners of the American\r\n  Government who negotiated a treaty of peace and commerce with\r\n  Morocco in 1787. He was one of the marshals who inaugurated\r\n  George Washington as first President of the United States.\r\n  There were other members of the Franks family who remained in\r\n  Montreal and who fought on the side of the British against the\r\n  American colonists. A sister of David Salesby Franks married the\r\n  Levy Solomons who is mentioned above and who was at that time\r\n  president of the Montreal Jewish Congregation “Shearith Israel.”\r\n  One of their daughters, Rachel Solomon, became the wife of Henry\r\n  Joseph, who in his day was one of the most prominent Jews in\r\n  Canada. Henry Joseph was born in England in the latter part of\r\n  the eighteenth century. He was nephew of Commissary General Aaron\r\n  Hart and came to Canada when but a youth and entered the army,\r\n  being attached to the troops that formed the garrison of Fort\r\n  William Henry at the mouth of the Richelieu River. He afterwards\r\n  became interested in the Northwest Trading Company and eventually\r\n  retired from the army to develop trade from Hudson’s Bay to\r\n  Quebec and Montreal. His headquarters were for a long while at\r\n  Berthier, but he perceived even in that early day that Montreal\r\n  was destined to become a place of importance, and he removed\r\n  his home to this city in his latter days. It is claimed that\r\n  he was the actual founder of Canada’s merchant marine service,\r\n  for he was the owner of a line of ships that were the first to\r\n  be registered as Canadian vessels engaged exclusively in direct\r\n  traffic between Canada and England. He rejoined the army when\r\n  the War of 1812-14 broke out between England and the United\r\n  States and fought for the British crown in many engagements.\r\n  Associated with him as a Hudson’s Bay trader was Jacob Franks, a\r\n  member of the family above mentioned, who had married a sister of\r\n  Mrs. Henry Joseph and who was also noted as a very enterprising\r\n  northwest and Hudson’s Bay trader. He was the founder of Green\r\n  Bay, Wisconsin, and Jacob Astor was originally employed by him\r\n  there. Another very influential member of the early Jewish\r\n  community in this city was David David, the eldest son of Lazarus\r\n  David. He was born in Montreal in 1764 and took a prominent part\r\n  in almost everything which affected the interests of Montreal in\r\n  his day. Possessed of considerable wealth he employed his means\r\n  in works of benevolence, and his generous assistance to the early\r\n  philanthropic societies of Montreal is on record. He was either\r\n  president or director of a number of institutions. It was due\r\n  largely to his initiative that the Bank of Montreal was founded\r\n  in 1817, and he was elected a director on its first regular\r\n  board on the 27th of February, 1818, and continued to hold this\r\n  office until his death in 1824. He was also president of the\r\n  Spanish and Portuguese Synagogue in Montreal for many years.\r\n\r\n  In addition to members of the David and Joseph families already\r\n  mentioned, who fought for the British flag in the War of 1812-14,\r\n  the names of a number of other Hebrew citizens are to be found\r\n  also participating on the British side in that struggle, and\r\n  there was also a large number of Canadian Jews who fought on the\r\n  loyalist side in the rebellion of 1837-38, notably Colonel David,\r\n  Aaron Philip Hart, Jacob Henry Joseph and several members of the\r\n  Hays family.\r\n\r\n  The exact legal status of the Jews in Canada was not made very\r\n  clear at an early date by any definite enactments, and for long\r\n  they labored under the disability of not having the right of\r\n  sitting in Parliament. This question was brought to a definite\r\n  test by the election in 1807 of Mr. Ezekiel Hart, second son of\r\n  Commissariat General Hart, as member of the Legislative Assembly\r\n  for Three Rivers. When he entered the House he was required\r\n  to take the oath in the usual form “on the true faith of a\r\n  Christian” and upon his declining to do this on account of his\r\n  Jewish faith the majority of the members objected to his taking\r\n  his seat and declared the seat vacant. Appealing again to his\r\n  constituents he was once more elected by a heavy majority, but\r\n  again the House refused to permit him to take his seat, and after\r\n  a stormy session a bill was pushed through to its second reading\r\n  to disqualify Jews from being eligible to sit as members of the\r\n  House of Assembly. This aroused the indignation of Sir James\r\n  Craig, who was then governor, and he angrily dissolved the House\r\n  and prevented the bill from passing. After a long struggle an act\r\n  was introduced and passed in 1831 by which Jews were accorded\r\n  the fullest civil rights in Canada and were placed upon an equal\r\n  footing with all other citizens of the land. Ezekiel Hart was\r\n  deservedly popular and it is stated that the opposition which\r\n  was shown to his taking his seat was due more to the political\r\n  partisanship of his political opponents than to any real feeling\r\n  of religious intolerance. It is worthy of note that Canada\r\n  extended full political rights to the Jews more than a quarter of\r\n  a century earlier than the mother country.\r\n\r\n  Of the later Hebrews may be mentioned Moses J. Hays, who was one\r\n  of the most active men engaged in municipal affairs in Montreal\r\n  in the early part of the nineteenth century, and to his energy\r\n  the city was indebted for many civic improvements. It was he who\r\n  established the first Montreal waterworks. He also reorganized\r\n  Montreal’s police force, of which he was the chief commissioner,\r\n  and he was the builder of the Hays House, the leading hotel of\r\n  Montreal in its day, situated on what was then known as Dalhousie\r\n  Square, but which has since been swept away to make room for the\r\n  Place Viger entrance of the Canadian Pacific Railway.\r\n\r\n  Abraham de Sola, the rabbi attached to the Shearith Israel\r\n  Congregation, was recognized as in the first rank of Jewish\r\n  leaders in the cabinet. He was elected in 1848 professor\r\n  of Semitic literature and oriental languages of the McGill\r\n  University.\r\n\r\n  During the period of Doctor De Sola’s administration the Spanish\r\n  and Portuguese Jewish Congregation of the Shearith Israel\r\n  Synagogue, formed by the first Jew settlers in 1768, counted\r\n  among its members a number of men who were very prominent in\r\n  Montreal’s social, intellectual and commercial life. Amongst\r\n  these was Dr. A.H. David, a grandson of Lazarus David, who,\r\n  besides being a prominent physician, was dean of the medical\r\n  faculty of Bishop’s College. Samuel Benjamin, Goodman Benjamin\r\n  and William Benjamin were three brothers who were all very well\r\n  known in Montreal between the ’40s and ’60s in the past century.\r\n  Samuel Benjamin took a very prominent part in civic affairs and\r\n  was for a long while member of the city council, being the first\r\n  Israelite to attain that position in Montreal. Four sons of\r\n  Henry Joseph, Jacob Henry, Abraham, Jesse and Gershom, were all\r\n  prominent. Probably there was no citizen of Montreal better known\r\n  in his day and associated with more of our public activities than\r\n  Jesse Joseph. He was either president or director of over fifteen\r\n  different companies or institutions.\r\n\r\n  Another member of the Congregation of Shearith Israel was Isidor\r\n  Ascher, who earned a respectable reputation as a poet. He was the\r\n  author of “Voices from the Hearth” which Longfellow so highly\r\n  commended, and of a number of other works, both in verse and\r\n  in prose. His father, G.I. Ascher, was long a patriarchial and\r\n  familiar figure in Montreal life in the nineteenth century, for\r\n  he reached the venerable age of ninety-six years. Alexander\r\n  Levy, Jacob Levy, Samuel Israel Rubenstein, Edward Cohen and\r\n  Lewis A. Hart were well-known officers of the congregation in\r\n  more recent years. The last mentioned was for some years lecturer\r\n  on notarial practice at McGill University.\r\n\r\n  Dr. Abraham de Sola died in 1882, and was succeeded by his eldest\r\n  son, Meldola de Sola.\r\n\r\n  The Jews have always shown an interest in both civic and national\r\n  politics, and at the present moment there are two Jewish citizens\r\n  who are members of the city council.\r\n\r\n\r\n              OTHER NATIONAL ORIGINS OF THE PEOPLE\r\n\r\nThe foregoing do not exhaust the list of Societies for national\r\nand racial conservation. There are others such as the “Société\r\nSuisse de Montréal,” “The Scandinavian National Society,” “The\r\nJersey (Channel Island) Society of Canada” and others. Suffice it\r\nto say that Montreal is now veritably cosmopolitan as the census\r\nof 1911 will demonstrate.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       CENSUS OF MONTREAL\r\n\r\n ORIGINS OF THE PEOPLE BY SUB-DISTRICTS OF THE CITY OF MONTREAL\r\n                            FOR 1911\r\n\r\n  LEGEND:\r\n\r\n  British\r\n    E = English;\r\n    I = Irish;\r\n    S = Scotch;\r\n    O = Other.\r\n\r\n  Fr. = French\r\n  Ge. = German\r\n  A-H. = Austro-Hungarian\r\n  Be. = Belgian\r\n  BR. = Bulgarian and Rumanian\r\n  Ch. = Chinese\r\n\r\n   Districts and                   British\r\n      Sub-districts          /--------^----------\\\r\n                              En.

There is in\r\nthe McGill University Library bound up with sermons and essays,\r\nthe first being an essay concerning the human rational soul, a\r\nrare pamphlet bearing the title, “The case of the Canadians of\r\nMontreal, distressed by fire.” There is no date of publication or\r\npublisher’s name. It is marked “Second Edition” and a postscript\r\nin it shows that this second edition was printed after March\r\n20, 1766; probably in London. The second page has the following\r\nsub-title:\r\n\r\n                            “Motives\r\n                              for a\r\n                          Subscription\r\n             Towards the relief of the sufferers at\r\n                       Montreal in Canada\r\n\r\n“by a dreadful fire on the 18th of May, 1765, in which 108 houses\r\n          (containing 125 families, chiefly Canadians)\r\n     were destroyed; and the greater part of the inhabitants\r\n     exposed to all the miseries attending such misfortunes.\r\n            The whole loss in buildings, merchandise,\r\n                      furniture and apparel\r\n                   amounted to £87,580 8. 10d.\r\n          sterling; no part of which could be insured.”\r\n\r\nUnderneath there is a wood cut of Canada kneeling before\r\nBritannia pointing with her left hand to the burning blocks and\r\nappealing for relief. Underneath are the words: MONTREAL MAY\r\nMDCCLXV. By consulting the concluding pages of “The case for the\r\nCanadians” we see that the pamphlet is the appeal of a committee\r\nof trustees in London “who meet at the New York Coffee House\r\nevery Thursday at 11 o’clock and will be glad to be favored\r\nwith the assistance of any subscriber.” The treasurer was John\r\nThornton, Esq., and there were twenty-three members, of whom\r\nEdward Green, secretary, concludes the list. There follows a list\r\nof firms of merchants and others in the city to the number of\r\ntwenty who would take subscriptions.\r\n\r\nThe motives as eloquently expressed in the opening part of the\r\nappeal are firstly those of common humanity; secondly, the\r\n“Canadians are our fellow subjects.” “The consideration of\r\ndistance ought to make no difference in the minds of a people\r\nwhose EMPIRE is extended to so many places over the earth.”\r\n“There are other weighty considerations: much the greater part\r\nof these sufferers are _strangers_ who, to use the language of\r\nliberty, the fortune of war has put under _our_ protection;\r\nand those who have not seen them may form some idea of them\r\nby report. They are _stout_, _comely_ and _intrepid_, of a\r\nvigilant, laborious, and _obedient_ disposition. They have given\r\nproof of their discernment as well as of the _necessity_ of\r\ntheir situation by the preference they have shown to _British\r\nSovereignty_ when they were at their liberty to have gone to\r\n_Old France_, and though military government, which took place,\r\nis seldom the most favourable to a commercial people, they had\r\nreason to be sensible of the advantageous change. There is now\r\na form of _Civil Oeconomy_: if it is duly administered and not\r\ntinctured with military power it will be the most grateful to\r\na brave and intelligent people. It is our wisdom and our duty\r\nto show them in every instance that we are as willing to be\r\n_Their_ friends as _They can be Ours_, and let us endeavour to\r\nsecure their fidelity to the crown of the realm by engaging their\r\n_Hearts_ as well as their _tongues_. They profess allegiance\r\nto the _King_, let us engage them by every tye to render that\r\nallegiance inviolable.”\r\n\r\nThe details of the disaster are then given. The concluding words\r\nof the appeal, after an allusion to the “Most Awful Gratitude”\r\nto “_Divine Providence_” which has blessed His Majesty’s arms\r\nand given him “the possession of the country of which the city\r\nin question is in several respects the principal” are: “In\r\nthese several views we present the cause of the sufferers in\r\n_Montreal_. It is meant that no circumstance which religion,\r\nhumanity or True Policy can suggest shall be omitted. Thus\r\nshall we conciliate their minds to the British Government and\r\nrender the oeconomy of it in that quarter of the world so much\r\nthe _safer_. In proportion to the encouragement afforded by the\r\npromotion of useful industry and labour it is to be presumed\r\ntheir attachment to their country will increase by such means\r\nwe shall also show them that _Our Protestantism_ inspirs the\r\nmost essential part of Christianity: We shall show them that the\r\n_British_ nation is not more to be dreaded for their _valor_\r\nand _intrepidity_ than beloved, for the exercise of the _social\r\nvirtues_; and these qualities, displayed on this occasion, will\r\nin their natural tendency promote that harmony on which the\r\nprosperity of the state depends. Thus shall we behold commerce\r\nand navigation, _Fixed on the securest basis_; benevolence\r\ncherished; the hearts of all the subjects of the _British Empire_\r\nunited by a concordance of sentiment; a just discernment of\r\nwhat is right and fit for the common good; and a resolution to\r\nadhere to such right. And being thus bound by a sincere and\r\nmutual affection, even the most adverse events may in the issue\r\ncontribute to give permanancy to the state and uninterrupted\r\nhappiness to the _King_ and his people.”\r\n\r\nThis committee by March 20, 1766, had collected £1,818 16s 8d, of\r\nwhich His Majesty contributed £500. The “case of the Canadians”\r\nis worth quoting further, since it gives a picture of the city\r\nat this period from an English point of view. “Montreal contains\r\nabout seven thousand inhabitants. It is here that the French\r\nCanadians were most desirous of retreating when they had acquired\r\na subsistence; the adjacent country where they had many seats and\r\nfarms on the banks of the river being delightfully pleasant and\r\nthe climate more agreeable than at Quebec.” It was computed that\r\none-fourth of the city was consumed and about one-third part in\r\nvalue. The loss sustained by the “dreadful fire” was carefully\r\nattested by His Excellency, the Honourable James Murray.

It broke\r\nout at the roof and in an instant the whole was in a flame which\r\ncommunicated to the neighboring houses on both sides of St.\r\nFrancis Street. The confusion and distress of the inhabitants\r\nis not to be exprest. Many of them were in the country and\r\nthose who were present had not any time to save any part of\r\ntheir merchandize or household goods. Others lost all, even to\r\ntheir books, papers, plate, money. This misfortune has fallen\r\non the richest and most trading part of the city, where the\r\nbuildings were the best and most filled with merchandize. But\r\nthe far greater part of the sufferers have now only the cloths\r\non their backs. Many who had the fortune to save the few goods\r\nout of their houses and lay them on rafts or by the riverside\r\nlost them again, either by the flames or theft. The fire was\r\nstopt by uncovering Mons. Landrieve’s house, one end of the\r\nhospital and two small houses between Mons. St. Germain’s and\r\nthe corner opposite Mons. Reaume’s. The wind, which, when the\r\nfire began, was at N.N.W., turned suddenly to N.E. which, with\r\nthese precautions and the united efforts of the soldiers and the\r\ninhabitants, saved the rest of the town. For, had it gone up that\r\nstreet which leads to the parish church or fired the hospital\r\n_des Soeurs_ it would have been difficult, if not impossible, to\r\nhave saved any part of the town. There are 110 principal houses\r\nburnt.”\r\n\r\nFrom footnotes we learn that though the houses destroyed were\r\nmade of limestone they were either covered with shingles\r\nmade of white cedar in the manner of tyle or with boards;\r\nand they had not at this time any fire engines. Last summer\r\ntwo of these useful machines were sent over to them. It must\r\nalso be considered that the houses were inclosed within the\r\nfortifications and some so near that one of the city gates\r\nwas burnt as well as the General Hospital without the gates.\r\nA postscript of 11th of February, 1766, adds: “It should be\r\nobserved that the rooms of their houses at Montreal are floored\r\nwith clay and stones laid on them in order to prevent fire;\r\nbut as the French in Europe are much behind us in the mechanic\r\narts which contribute to the safety and convenience of life\r\nthey are still more so in their colonies; to which cause we may\r\nattribute these Canadians having been without fire engines on\r\nthis occasion. This misfortune will be remedied hereafter and it\r\nmay be hoped every other conveniency will be introduced among\r\nthem and especially the conveyance of water to reservoirs which\r\nis much wanted there. This defect, indeed, is the more pardonable\r\nwhen it is considered that in so vast and opulent a city as\r\nLondon it is but the other day it was attended by very fatal\r\nconsequences.” “It is hoped,” concludes the postscript, “every\r\nexpedient that reason and experience can suggest will hereafter\r\nbe brought into use now that they have such able instructors as\r\nourselves.”\r\n\r\nThen, various devices for roofing and covering the houses are\r\nsuggested. “Iron plate coverings are certainly the best as\r\npracticed in Sweden and in Russia. Two layers of brown paper dipt\r\nin hot tar placed over the wooden roof and under layers of iron\r\nplates will probably answer better. Some of the persons now going\r\nto Canada intend to try if slate will not stand the frost.”\r\n\r\nThe practical genius of the English was to be devoted to Montreal\r\nand Canada. Thus during the early part of British rule, as\r\nin that of the recent French régime, Montreal being built so\r\nlargely of wood, was in constant danger of fire. The English\r\ngovernors early saw this and some of Gage’s earliest acts were\r\nto fight this peril. Another fire in 1768 destroyed more than\r\na hundred houses. In 1777 an act was promulgated by Governor\r\nCarleton providing for the appointment of an inspector to prevent\r\naccidents by fire in each of the towns of Quebec, Montreal and\r\nThree Rivers. The inspectors were to see that the chimneys were\r\nswept once a month and each tenant was obliged to take certain\r\nprecautions against fire under penalty of a fine. Under the\r\nFrench régime regulations were issued that buckets of water\r\nshould be kept in readiness and should be carried to the scene\r\nof fire when the signal was given. The carpenters were to carry\r\ntheir axes.\r\n\r\nEarly after the conquest “Fire Club No. 1” was formed by a body\r\nof fifteen merchants apparently for mutual self protection. Fires\r\nwere still constant, some of them threatening the very existence\r\nof the city.\r\n\r\nOn the 6th of June, 1803, a destructive fire took place in\r\nMontreal. It broke out in the house of a man named Chevalier in\r\nSt. Lawrence Main Street on the northeast side towards the upper\r\nend. As the wind was high and variable, the outhouses on both\r\nsides of the street soon took fire. At a quarter to four the roof\r\nof the jail was burning, soon followed by the English church on\r\nthe northeast and the Roman Catholic chapel on the southwest\r\nside. These, to use the words of the reports by the magistrate\r\nwere “instantaneously consumed.” It was with difficulty the\r\ncourthouse was saved. Besides the jail and two church buildings\r\nthe old church of the Jesuits, the Roman Catholic College (St.\r\nRaphael) and eleven houses were burnt in the lower part of the\r\ntown. About 10 o’clock at night the fire was under control at\r\nthe house adjoining that occupied by Mr. Justice Ogden. In the\r\nsuburbs, where it originated, the fire was extinguished by\r\nsunset, after destroying thirteen houses besides outhouses,\r\nstables, etc.\r\n\r\nOther fires followed during the summer of so alarming a character\r\nthat it seemed evident they did not arise from accident, but from\r\ndesign, and a reward of £500 was offered for the apprehension of\r\nthe offenders. With the exception of the first, which took place\r\nin June, these fires broke out during the first week in August\r\nand the magistrates offered a reward of £250, making with that\r\noffered by the governor £750 for the detection of the criminal.\r\nThe succession of fires is thus reported. On Monday, August 1st,\r\na little after 1 o’clock in the morning, fire broke out and\r\nconsumed two houses; on Tuesday morning, at 6 o’clock, a stable\r\nwas discovered to be on fire but was pulled down and the fire\r\nextinguished; on Wednesday several houses were burnt, one man\r\nkilled and a number more or less seriously wounded; on Friday\r\nother fires broke out entirely destroying a number of houses, and\r\nit was with difficulty the lower part of the town was saved from\r\na serious conflagration. Patrols were established and precautions\r\ntaken to guard against the repetition of the fires.[1]\r\n\r\nIn 1824 a volunteer fire association of 100 was formed under\r\nM. Antoine Lepage, assisted by Doctor Berthelet, with its\r\nstation near Notre Dame Church. In 1825 the Property Protection\r\nFire Company was organized by Captain John Lukin. On the 7th\r\nof September, 1825, a fire broke out in an outhouse belonging\r\nto a cooper of the name of Dumaine, situated in the rear of a\r\nhouse forming the corner of St. Mary and Campeau streets. Over\r\neighty dwellings and outhouses were consumed. Had it not been\r\nthat there was no wind during the time and that the services of\r\nthe Seventieth Regiment were at hand the fire might have been\r\nextremely disastrous to the town.\r\n\r\nThe new municipal fathers took early steps by a regulation of the\r\n3d of June, 1841, to create a fire department. It was to consist\r\nof an inspector, superintendent, a chief engineer, a captain\r\nand a lieutenant for each company of firemen. When the Oregon\r\nboundary dispute with the slogan of its agitators “Fifty-four\r\nforty or fight,” was creating anti-British feeling in 1846, the\r\nMontreal fire brigade was formed into a battalion of militia\r\nunder the command of the mayor, the Honourable James Ferrier,\r\nMr. John Fletcher, afterwards Lieutenant-Colonel Fletcher, being\r\nappointed adjutant. The battalion drilled, but without arms, in\r\nthe market hall for several years, even after the excitement\r\nof the Oregon incident had died away. On the breaking out of\r\nthe Crimean war, Captain Fletcher offered authoritatively the\r\nservices of 100 men of the Montreal fire brigade as volunteers\r\nfor the war and received the thanks of the secretary of war for\r\ntheir patriotism.\r\n\r\nThe voluntary system of firemen continued to the 30th of April,\r\n1863, when the last companies, then ten, received their last\r\npayment. On the 1st of May, 1863, the system of the telegraph\r\nalarm was introduced as well as No. 1 fire station at the corner\r\nof Chenneville and Craig streets. The new firemen, to the number\r\nof thirty, with salaries varying from the equivalent of two\r\nhundred and forty dollars to three hundred and sixty-five dollars\r\na year, were supplemented by a certain number of volunteers with\r\nan honorarium of about twenty dollars annually until 1867. Until\r\n1868 the duties included the watering of the streets. Hand pumps\r\nwere then in vogue, the steam pump not being used until 1871.\r\n\r\nIn 1863, therefore, the fire department was more fully organized\r\nand has developed to its present efficiency.\r\n\r\nUnder a by-law passed May 10, 1865, the fire department was\r\nreorganized in two sections; the “City Fire Police,” consisting\r\nof a chief engineer, an assistant engineer, a hosewasher and\r\ncleaner, eight guardians, eight assistant guardians, and eight\r\ndrivers, with eight stations; and the “City Fire Company,”\r\ncomposed of such members of the former fire department as chose\r\nto offer their services, not to exceed thirty-six in number, with\r\nthe right to enroll eighteen supernumerary members to supply\r\nthe places of absentees. They were to be under the immediate\r\ncommand of a captain and two lieutenants. The fire department\r\nhad to operate the fire engines, hose, hooks and ladders, axes,\r\netc., and the city fire company was for the purpose of operating\r\nfire engines, working hose, placing ladders and any other duty\r\nrequired of them in aid to the fire police. The members enjoyed\r\nall the privileges and immunities of firemen; the thirty-six\r\nmen had salaries of $20.00 a year, subject to draw-back for\r\nnonattendance and the Supernumerary members were entitled to pay\r\nonly when supplying the place of absentee members. The captain\r\nwas paid $50.00 a year and the lieutenants got $40.00 each. The\r\nmembers of the city fire police got salaries ranging from $800.00\r\na year for the chief engineer, down to $240.00 a year for the\r\ndrivers.\r\n\r\nThe day’s work for the fire police was divided into four watches\r\nof six hours each and it was provided that “when not on watch\r\nor engaged in street-watering as is hereafter provided, the\r\nguardians and drivers may be absent for meals, and if married,\r\nfor the purpose of attending to their families; but with the\r\nexception of the first, leave of absence shall first be obtained.”\r\n\r\nIn 1910 the fire brigade consisted of 1 chief, 1 deputy chief,\r\n6 district chiefs, 29 captains, 38 lieutenants, 19 engineers,\r\n100 first class firemen at $800 a year, 103 second class firemen\r\nat $725, 26 third class firemen at $675, and 100 fourth class\r\nfiremen at $625, and 27 other members with various duties.\r\n\r\nThe apparatus was composed of 90 pieces, including 29 hose\r\nwagons, 2 Siamese wagons, 6 aerial ladder trucks, 16 hook and\r\nladder trucks, 3 salvage wagons, 2 water towers, 2 chemical\r\nengines, 1 hose and chemical wagon, 6 coal wagons, 1 automobile\r\nand 9 buggies for officers. The brigade was called out 2,143\r\ntimes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MONTREAL’S AUTOMOBILE FIRE-FIGHTING APPARATUS]\r\n\r\nDuring the last two years automobiles for the various officers\r\nhave increased in number. In the summer of 1912 an automobile\r\nfire hose apparatus was ordered for No. 20 station and two\r\nautomobile tractors, one for the aerial ladder truck and\r\nthe other for the 1200 steam fire engine. These proving\r\nsuccessful, on the recommendation of the fire chief the Board of\r\nCommissioners ordered three more of the latter in December, 1913,\r\nand a large order was placed for more at the beginning of 1914,\r\nso that now twelve motor power apparatuses are employed with more\r\nto follow. The day of the horse seems to be doomed for the city\r\nfire stations as too slow.\r\n\r\nThe fire chiefs of Montreal since 1863 have been:\r\n\r\n  Alexander Bertram    1863-1873\r\n  William Patton       1873-1888\r\n  Zephyrin Benoit      1888-1908\r\n  J. Tremblay          1909-\r\n\r\n\r\n                        FIGHTING DARKNESS\r\n\r\nThe lighting of Montreal dates from 1815. Up to this no public\r\nprovision had been made. Darkness is the friend of vice, and\r\nburglaries were numerous. In November, 1815, through the\r\nexertions of Mr. Samuel Dawson and others, that portion of\r\nSt. Paul Street west of the old market (now Place Royale) was\r\nhandsomely lighted by twenty-two oil lamps fixed at a distance\r\nof fifty-four feet from each other, each costing when ready\r\nfor use $7.00 each. The east side of St. Paul Street raised a\r\nsubscription “not to be outshown by their neighbours!” Notre Dame\r\nshortly followed the “bright example set.” This activity led on\r\nthe citizens to petition parliament to provide night watches and\r\nstreet lamps for the town. In April, 1818, an act was passed\r\nproviding for this. The number of men appointed was twenty-four,\r\ntheir duties being to attend to the trimming and lighting of the\r\nlamps and to act as guardians of the city. They used to call out\r\nthe hours of the night, such as “Past 12 o’clock and a starlit\r\nnight” through the drowsy streets. Within the homes the humble\r\ncandle was still used and each household had its implements to\r\nmake these simple dips or rush lights. Afterwards ready-made\r\ncandles from England were sold. When candles were first\r\nintroduced they were thought miraculous, but there are still\r\nsome living in Montreal who remember how, in their youth, before\r\ncandles, grease or oil would be put in a spoon, and carried\r\nthrough the house at night to light the way from room to room.\r\nLucifer matches of the modern type were a wonder. The flint was\r\nused with tinders half a century ago.\r\n\r\nThe first gas works were built in 1836 at the Cross, then about\r\none mile from the city, and some shops were lighted on the 23d of\r\nNovember, 1837. The proprietors were incorporated by an act of\r\nthe provincial legislature in April, 1836. Mr. Armstrong was the\r\nproprietor and Mr. E.A. Furness was the principal stockholder and\r\nmanager. The city was dilatory in making use of their services.\r\n\r\nThe New City Gas Company was established in 1847. In 1848 it was\r\nable to announce to its patrons that it had reduced the charge\r\nper 1,000 cubic feet from 25 shillings to 12 shillings, 6 pence.\r\nThis is a far cry to the present rate. The New City Gas Company\r\nchanged its name in 1879 to the Montreal Gas Company which was\r\namalgamated in the Montreal Light, Heat and Power Company in 1901.\r\n\r\nThe origin of the lighting of Montreal by electricity may be\r\nbriefly told. In 1878 Mr. J.I. Craig, of Montreal, returning from\r\nthe Paris exhibition, determined to work out some experiments\r\nin electric lighting following on demonstrations seen in Paris.\r\nAccordingly he built himself Gramme bipolars, four polar machines\r\nand a Gramme alternation to supply current for Gablacoff candles.\r\nIn 1879 he was allowed to give a demonstration by fixing up\r\nlamps on Bonaventure Street (now St. James), between Seigneurs\r\nand Guy streets. Another exhibition was given facing the Champ\r\nde Mars, having its generators in the building of the “Le Monde”\r\nnewspaper, and his lamps on that now occupied by the “Chambre\r\nde Commerce” on St. Gabriel Street. At the midnight mass on\r\nChristmas eve, 1879, at St. Joseph’s Church, Richmond Street, he\r\ngave an illustration of its services in interior illumination.\r\nIn 1882 a company called the “Phoenix” was formed to promote the\r\ncommercial utility of Mr. Craig’s inventions, which consisted\r\nof dynamos, arc lamps and storage batteries. In the same year\r\nthe harbour commissioners purchased a Brush generator with arc\r\nlights and were thus the first to adopt the new light. In 1884\r\nthe firm of Thompson & Houston, which became the Royal Electric\r\nCompany, secured the contract to light some of the streets,\r\ncommencing with St. James. In 1885 the Phoenix Company going\r\ninto liquidation, the estate was purchased by Mr. J.I. Craig,\r\nwho put up several plants in the province of Quebec and between\r\n1887 and 1890 secured the contracts for St. Henri, St. Cunégonde\r\nand Coté St. Antoine. The first alternating current in the city\r\nwas installed in 1890 by the Royal Electric Company. In 1895\r\nthe Royal Electric was merged with the Montreal Gas Company\r\nand the St. Lawrence Electric Company which was exploiting\r\na hydro-electric plant at Chambly. Later the Lachine Rapids\r\nHydraulic & Land Company, the Provincial Light, Heat & Power\r\nCompany, the Standard Light, Heat & Power Company, the Citizens\r\nLight, Heat & Power Company and the Temple Electric Company were\r\nalso added. The whole combination is now known as the Montreal\r\nLight, Heat & Power Company of today, which has its head offices\r\nat the Power Building on Craig Street.\r\n\r\nAnother body entitled the “Montreal Public Service Company,”\r\na merger, which obtained its charter about 1912, controls the\r\nCanadian Light, Heat & Power, the Montreal Electric, the Saraguay\r\nand the Dominion Central Electric Company. The offices of this\r\nsecond corporation are in the Eastern Townships Building. Between\r\nthese two companies Montreal is lighted in 1914.\r\n\r\nWe may add the following notes of the origin of our electric\r\nfire alarm, telephone service and other electric developments in\r\nMontreal:\r\n\r\nThe first telegraph wire connecting Quebec and Montreal was\r\ninstalled in 1847. But the first wire strung in the Dominion was\r\nput up in the same year by the Toronto, Hamilton, Niagara and St.\r\nCatherine’s Telegraph Company. The Montreal Telegraph Company\r\nwas organized in 1846, and was incorporated by a special act\r\nof the legislature of Canada in 1847, and first opened between\r\nQuebec and Toronto. A message from Toronto to Montreal cost\r\n3s. 9d., in Halifax currency, for ten words. The Montreal fire\r\nalarm telegraph, with which is connected the police telegraph\r\nand the telegraph in connection with the water department,\r\nwas built by Messrs. J.F. Kennard & Company, of Boston. The work\r\nwas commenced on the 2d of September and completed on the 26th\r\nof December, 1862, at a cost of $20,000. This line went into\r\noperation on the 19th of January, 1863, and “entered on its\r\nduties by striking the hour of 12 noon,” as is announced in a\r\nhandbook issued in 1863 by the London & Liverpool Fire & Light\r\nInsurance Company. Electricity was first used as a motive power\r\nin Canada in 1883, when a short piece of track was laid on the\r\ngrounds of the Toronto Industrial Exhibition. The first practical\r\nroad was laid in 1884. In 1885 the track was lengthened and the\r\noverhead wire and trolley arm used. The possibility of combating\r\nthe snow was demonstrated successfully in 1891 by the Ottawa\r\nElectric Railway Company. Montreal followed in 1892, when the\r\ncity passenger rails were electrified. Quebec followed in 1897.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE POWER HOUSE]\r\n\r\n\r\n                         FIGHTING FLOODS\r\n\r\nFloods in the early days of Maisonneuve had threatened the\r\nold stockade fort and till modern days the lower part of the\r\ncity has constantly been inundated. On Thursday, the 14th of\r\nJanuary, 1848, the waters of the St. Lawrence rose for three\r\ndays and flooded, to a depth of from two to six feet, the\r\nlower part of the city, Griffintown and the emigrant sheds at\r\nPoint St. Charles, where the sick from the fever were lying.\r\nIn February, 1857, Griffintown was the scene of another and\r\nsimilar inundation. The lower part was like a series of canals\r\nand communication between the houses was by small boats. More\r\nimportant was the inundation of 1861 when the flood extended\r\nover one-fourth of the city. Griffintown was again submerged.\r\nThe trains from the west and from Lachine were unable to enter\r\nthe city and passengers had to find their way to the city by\r\nSherbrooke Street. “The extent of the inundation,” says Sandham,\r\n“may be conceived from the fact that the river rose about\r\ntwenty-four feet above its average level. The whole of St. Paul\r\nStreet and up McGill Street to St. Maurice Street, and from\r\nthence to the limits of the city was entirely submerged and boats\r\nascended McGill Street as far as St. Paul Street. To add to\r\nthe suffering of the people the thermometer sank rapidly and a\r\nviolent and bitter snowstorm set in on Tuesday, April 15th, and\r\ncontinued to rage with great fury all night.” Another flood in\r\nthe lower town, second only to that of 1861, occurred in April,\r\n1865. The damage done was not so great owing to the gradual rise\r\nof the waters, the inhabitants being able to remove their effects.\r\n\r\nIn the flood of April 17th, 18th and 19th, 1886, it inundated\r\nnearly one-half of what then constituted Montreal. The “Witness”\r\nof the above dates contained a long account of the flood.\r\n\r\nAccording to this, the conditions became really serious on Sunday\r\nmorning, April 18, while the people were at church. A big ice\r\nshove occurred in the river, and ice was soon piled up twenty or\r\nthirty feet high on St. Helen’s Island. * * * But there was yet\r\nno break in the Longueuil and Hochelaga ice, and the crushing,\r\ngrumbling ice in the channel commenced to pack more thickly and\r\nto rear pyramids more profusely than before. At the last the mass\r\nstopped moving altogether.\r\n\r\nWhen the water rushed backward, finding no sufficient outlet in\r\nthe channel, Chaboillez Square, St. James Street West, Craig\r\nStreet to Chenneville Street, and then to Cote Street, all were\r\nsoon covered, and those who had gone from the lower levels to\r\nuptown churches, or who had come down to churches on St. James\r\nStreet, and elsewhere, found that they had to make a detour as\r\nfar east as St. Urbain and St. Charles Borromee streets, in order\r\nto get past the flood. Higher it slowly came up, and was into\r\nSt. Urbain Street. It was also a few inches deep in St. Germain\r\nStreet. And the cellars were full almost from one end to the\r\nother of Craig Street.\r\n\r\nAt Victoria Square, several teamsters with express wagons\r\ncommenced a ferry service which was of great value to themselves\r\nand the public, for they charged 5, and in some cases 10 cents,\r\nto carry one across “the raging Victoria Canal.”\r\n\r\nThe eastern limit of the flood was just beyond Bonsecours Market,\r\nand Vitre Street was the farthest north. At Bonsecours Market the\r\ndealers could not get into their cellars at all.\r\n\r\nAt Jacques Cartier Square, the water was nearly to the corner\r\nof St. Paul Street, and the lamp posts at the corner of\r\nJacques Cartier Square stood about half out of the water. The\r\nwater washed through the pillar letter box at the corner of\r\nCommissioners Street. St. Paul Street west from Custom House\r\nSquare was flooded. It was partly up St. Nicholas and St.\r\nFrançois Xavier, but had not reached St. Sacrament.\r\n\r\nTurning down St. Peter, pedestrians were brought to a sudden halt\r\njust north of Lemoine Street. The wrecking in the warehouses\r\nalong Lemoine Street was described as “disheartening and the\r\ndestruction appalling.”\r\n\r\nOn McGill Street, the wide space permitted any amount of boating,\r\nand skiffs and rafts were plying in all directions. McGill, above\r\nLemoine, was entirely under water.\r\n\r\n“A walk to Victoria Square opened the vista of St. James Street\r\nWest, which street, from St. Michael Lane West, was a sheet of\r\nwater as far as the eye could reach, the cars on the sidings at\r\nthe Bonaventure station standing in the flood.”\r\n\r\nThe City Passenger Railway had ceased to be able to get through\r\nto St. Alexander Street, and were almost cut off from proceeding\r\nup Bleury. Later on the Bleury Street route was also impassable,\r\nthe water flowing up Craig to the foot of Place d’Armes Hill.\r\n\r\nThe fires of the Montreal Gas Company’s works on Ottawa Street\r\nwere extinguished by water, and consequently the supply was cut\r\noff from the whole of the lower portion of the city. Fortunately\r\nthe company had another plant at Hochelaga which was not flooded.\r\n\r\nOn the south shore fields of ice swept over the country, knocking\r\ndown fences, barns, and portions of dwelling houses. Some of the\r\ninhabitants who had spent fifty or sixty years in St. Lambert\r\nsaid they had never seen the water reach the height it did this\r\ntime. At Longueuil the fine old Catholic church had four feet of\r\nwater in it and nearly the whole village was more or less under\r\nwater.\r\n\r\nThe following is a record made at the time by the city surveyor\r\nof the highest level reached by the water at the lowest points on\r\nvarious streets.\r\n\r\n                                       Feet.

In 1888 an embankment was made to prevent floods,\r\nsince when there has not been much trouble.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE FLOOD OF 1886]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ICE SHOVES]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE WATER FAMINE]\r\n\r\n\r\n                        FIGHTING DROUGHT\r\n\r\nFloods are bad but droughts are an evil, also, which a city has\r\nto forestall. How this has been done may be exemplified by the\r\nstory of the city’s waterworks. As this has been recently told\r\nagain by Mr. F. Clifford Smith, we shall largely follow his\r\nexcellent resumé prepared for the City Council last year.\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of the present century, when Montreal was a\r\ntown of about nine thousand inhabitants, who lived mainly within\r\nthe old fortifications, or, in other words, within the area\r\nbounded by the sites of McGill Street, Fortification Lane, Berri\r\nStreet and the St. Lawrence, the only means provided by the\r\nmunicipality for the supply of water consisted of public pumps\r\nat Place d’Armes, the Market Place (now Place Royale), Notre\r\nDame Street near the Courthouse, St. Jean Baptiste near St. Paul\r\nStreet, and a couple of other points. For the rest the citizens\r\nsupplied themselves with water from private wells and cisterns,\r\nand by watering carts from the St. Lawrence, and the creeks, the\r\nprincipal of which was the Petite Rivière which ran where Craig\r\nStreet now is. The pedding of water in big puncheons was a common\r\nand quaint custom of these early days. The water cart would be\r\ndriven into the river and filled. The poor women washed their\r\nlinen on the banks.\r\n\r\nIn 1800, after considerable talk about forming a waterworks,\r\nan act was passed incorporating Joseph Frobisher (one of the\r\nfounders of the Northwest Trading Company and builder of Beaver\r\nHall) and his associates[2] under the title of the Company of\r\nProprietors of the Montreal Waterworks. The capital invested was\r\n£6,000 with power to increase to £48,000. An exclusive franchise\r\nwas given for fifty years. The system decided upon was that\r\nof gravitation. Water was obtained from a pond in the rear of\r\nthe present Cote des Neiges village, and was brought to the\r\ncity through wooden pipes laid around the southern slope of the\r\nmountain, via Monklands and Cote St. Antoine Road, to cisterns\r\nwhich were placed one on the corner of Guy and Dorchester\r\nstreets, and the other on Notre Dame Street, just west of\r\nDalhousie Square.\r\n\r\nThe company’s trouble soon began. The supply, which was from\r\na well, was most precarious, while the frequent bursting of\r\nthe wooden pipes finally resulted in the enterprise becoming a\r\nfailure.\r\n\r\nIn 1816, the waterworks, and unexpired franchise of thirty-five\r\nyears, were offered for sale; and in the year 1819 they were\r\npurchased by a new company under the management of Mr. Thomas\r\nPorteous for £5,000. This company abandoned the gravitation\r\nsupply from the spring and instituted a steam pumping plant,\r\nthe engines, of course, being very primitive. The supply was\r\ngot from the St. Lawrence in the near vicinity of the city.\r\nInstead of wooden pipes, four-inch iron pipes were substituted,\r\nand wooden cisterns were then erected on Notre Dame Street east\r\nof Bonsecours Street. The cisterns were found to be very weak\r\nand were finally replaced with other wooden cisterns, but they\r\nwere lined with lead. The capacity of the cisterns was 240,000\r\ngallons. The pumping engine was placed on the west corner of\r\nWater and Friponne streets. The amount expended by Mr. Porteous\r\nwas about forty thousand[3] pounds. The four-inch pipes put down\r\nsoon proved insufficient; other troubles ensuing, this company\r\nalso sold out. The plant was advertised for sale and was bought\r\nin by Mr. J. Haynes for $60,000. Mr. Haynes quickly floated a new\r\ncompany which replaced the small pipes in the streets by pipes\r\nof ten inches diameter and installed a more powerful engine. In\r\n1843 two engines were at work with a pumping capacity of 93,000\r\ngallons. By this time there were laid in the streets fourteen\r\nmiles of pipes.\r\n\r\nIn 1843 also the first agitation was started for the city to own\r\nthe waterworks. It was kept up till 1845, when the municipality\r\nmade an offer of £50,000 for the plant, which was accepted.\r\n\r\n\r\n                   HISTORY UNDER CIVIC CONTROL\r\n\r\nIn 1847, two years after the civic authorities of Montreal had\r\ntaken over the primitive plant, the water committee made a report\r\nto the city council suggesting that a premium be offered for the\r\nbest plan to force water from the St. Lawrence into a reservoir\r\non the mountain. The idea was to get water power from the Lachine\r\nCanal. The suggestion was deemed impracticable and not acted upon.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1849 the city constructed a reservoir on what now is\r\nSt. Louis Square. Its height was 130 feet above the St. Lawrence\r\nand its cost was £3,000. By the year 1850 the corporation had\r\nlaid nineteen miles of iron pipe and six miles of lead pipes. The\r\nreservoir had a capacity of 3,000,000 gallons.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1852, the year of the great fire when much of the\r\nwaterworks system had been destroyed, the services of Mr. Thomas\r\nC. Keefer were procured by the city to draft a plan whereby\r\nthe city could get an entirely new water supply. The plan he\r\nproposed was adopted and has practically been in operation up to\r\nthe present, when it is being drastically changed. The system\r\nconsisted in an open canal having the entrance about a mile and\r\na half above the Lachine Rapids. The canal, or aqueduct, which\r\nwas four and three-quarters miles long, ended at a building\r\ncalled the Wheel House. This building contained two vertical\r\nhydraulic wheels operating a set of six pumps having a capacity\r\nof 4,000,000 gallons a day. The water was raised through a main\r\nof twenty-four-inch diameter, and ended at a reservoir where the\r\npresent McTavish reservoir stands. The construction of these\r\nworks lasted until 1856 and cost $280,236.53. The elevation\r\nof the aqueduct was thirty-seven feet above the level of the\r\nharbour. The dimensions of the aqueduct were forty feet wide at\r\nthe water surface and eight feet deep. The canal furnished more\r\nthan sufficient power to develop 300 horsepower, and to raise\r\n200 feet above the level of the water, in the harbor, 5,000,000\r\nimperial gallons of water, being at the rate of forty imperial\r\ngallons per capita. The hydraulic motive power was utilized by\r\ntwo breast wheels working six pumps. The old works were, of\r\ncourse, abandoned, and the pumping engines and reservoir on Notre\r\nDame Street, with their sites, were sold for the very modest sum\r\nof $23,320. The whole new system had been well devised and the\r\nsupply of water, indeed, was sufficient for a population twice as\r\nlarge as it was then; but troubles soon cropped up. Owing to the\r\nblocking up of the ice in the aqueduct, the formation of frasil\r\nand the annoyance caused by the backing up of water in the Little\r\nSt. Pierre River, the supply in winter frequently only averaged\r\nthree million gallons. The channel of the Little River St. Pierre\r\nwas deepened in 1857 and 1858, but not sufficiently to get rid\r\nof the back water in question. In the winter of 1863 a tailrace\r\nwas cut to the river which greatly ameliorated conditions. In\r\n1862 and 1863, owing to increased population and ice blocks at\r\nthe entrance of the intake, again the supply of water became\r\nso uncertain that the ancient custom of supplying water in\r\npuncheons had to be resorted to. This state of things naturally\r\ncaused a great deal of trouble and annoyance, to say nothing\r\nof the additional expense to the city. In 1866 the consumption\r\nhad actually reached 5,000,000 gallons a day, with the result\r\nthat the supply was once more quite inadequate. In this year the\r\nsuperintendent of the water department made a strong plea for\r\nthe purchase of steam engines; he held it was the only way that\r\nthe water famines, through which the city was passing, could\r\nbe prevented. Had there been a sufficient head of water in the\r\naqueduct to get enough power, the plea for steam would not have\r\nbeen made, owing to its very heavy cost.\r\n\r\nIt was in 1868 that the first steam engine was installed, and\r\nsome relief was experienced.\r\n\r\nLittle by little other steam pumps were added, but so steady was\r\nthe growth of population that there were constant fears of a\r\nshortage of water.\r\n\r\n\r\n                 CONSTRUCTION OF THE RESERVOIRS\r\n\r\nThe pressure on the pipes having been constantly unsatisfactory,\r\nand owing to the city expanding towards the higher levels, the\r\nconstruction of the present reservoirs had been decided upon.\r\nThe reservoir, called the McTavish reservoir, is of oblong shape\r\nwith semi-circular ends, and so placed in the mountain slope that\r\nthe surface of the rock is about level with the water surface on\r\none side, and with its bottom on the other. The natural rock\r\nwas used as a wall on the upper side, but on the lower side the\r\nwater is maintained by a masonry wall which is solidly banked.\r\nThe reservoir was divided transversely into two equal parts by a\r\nmasonry wall, and when first completed contained thirteen and a\r\nhalf million gallons. Later on extensive enlargements were made,\r\nuntil today its capacity is 37,000,000 gallons. Its elevation\r\nwhen full is 204 feet above the harbour. The entire cost of the\r\nreservoir is about one million dollars. Under the gatehouse,\r\nwhich stands on the reservoir wall, is a well or distributing\r\nchamber. Into the bottom of this well the main pipes from the\r\npumps are led, and opposite to them is a separate passage to\r\neach division of the reservoir. The pipes and passages are all\r\ncontrolled by gates, and by their means the water is turned\r\noff and on each division or main pipe, as may be desired. The\r\nwater from the pumps at the Wheel House does not go first to the\r\nreservoir and thence to the city; the reservoir merely takes the\r\noverflow water from the pumps at the Wheel House and stores it\r\nfor further use. In other words, it is a safety supply which the\r\ncity can depend upon in the event of sudden breakdown of pumps.\r\nBut the big reservoir, even when full, could not supply the city\r\nnow for two days.\r\n\r\nWhat is termed the High Level reservoir is considerably farther\r\nup the mountain than the McTavish reservoir. It was found\r\nnecessary to construct this in order to supply the district\r\nabove Sherbrooke Street; as the McTavish reservoir was at such\r\nan altitude that it could not give the required pressure for the\r\nmore elevated districts of the city. The High Level reservoir\r\ndraws its supply from the McTavish reservoir. Its pumping station\r\nis at the McTavish, and it is equipped with one 5,000,000 and\r\none 2,000,000 gallon pump. At the pumping station at the Wheel\r\nHouse there are six steam pumps. The High Level reservoir is 212\r\nfeet higher than the McTavish, or 413 feet above the harbour. Its\r\ncapacity is one and three-quarter million of gallons. Like the\r\nMcTavish it is built in the solid rock and is a most substantial\r\nstructure.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      PUMPING PLANT IN 1912\r\n\r\nAs it is now the city’s intent to do all of the pumping by\r\nhydro-electric power, it will be of interest to note, especially\r\nfor the future, what is the steam pumping plant of today.\r\n\r\nThe plant situated at the low level pumping station, Point St.\r\nCharles, is here seen:\r\n\r\n  Engine No. 1, erected in 1886, ten million gallons, high duty,\r\n  Worthington.\r\n\r\n  Engine No. 2, erected in 1894, ten million gallons, high duty,\r\n  Worthington.\r\n\r\n  Engine No. 3, erected in 1895, eight million gallons, low duty,\r\n  Worthington.\r\n\r\n  Engine No. 4, erected in 1905, twelve million gallons, high duty,\r\n  Worthington.\r\n\r\n  Engine No. 5, erected in 1909, twelve million gallons, turbine\r\n  with Bellis-Marcum engine.\r\n\r\n  Engine No. 6, erected in 1912, twelve million gallons, turbine\r\n  with Bellis-Marcum engine.\r\n\r\nThe plant at the High Level reservoir is as follows:\r\n\r\n  McTavish St. engine No. 1, erected in 1889, three million\r\n  gallons, Gilbert steam pump.\r\n\r\n  McTavish St. engine No. 2, erected in 1906, five million gallons,\r\n  Electric turbine.\r\n\r\n  Papineau St. engine No. 1, erected in 1911, six million gallons,\r\n  Electric turbine.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ANCIENT AQUEDUCT]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SHOPS OF ANCIENT AQUEDUCT]\r\n\r\nThe story of the water supply would be inadequate without an\r\naccount of the great drought that fell upon the city in the last\r\nweeks of 1913, caused by a break in the concrete conduit which\r\noccurred after dark on Christmas night. For 193 hours the city\r\nwas without an adequate water supply. It was in great alarm lest\r\na typhoid epidemic or fires should start. Luckily fires were\r\nfew, but one on St. Louis Square occurred when the want of water\r\ncaused a whole block to be burned down. The city authorities had\r\nwater carried round in the water carts and distributed to the\r\npeople, who besides this scanty service had to melt the snow,\r\nthen abundant, for culinary purposes. The danger of typhoid was\r\naverted by careful attention of the people to the directions of\r\nthe city health officers and other physicians. The event caused\r\ngreat excitement and much criticism. As a warning note of the\r\ndangers that may befall a modern city, the following adapted\r\naccount, published at the time, is chronicled here.[4]\r\n\r\n  Montreal’s 193-hour water famine, it is hoped, has passed and\r\n  gone, but that a city of its size should be so absolutely thrown\r\n  out of gear by the bursting of a single water conduit was such a\r\n  shock to the citizens, that they will want the facts of the case\r\n  to go down to posterity engraved in tables of stone--or concrete.\r\n\r\n  Shortly after dark on the evening of December 25th, a break\r\n  nearly sixty feet long appeared in the water supply conduit at\r\n  a point directly behind the Protestant Hospital for the Insane,\r\n  on La Salle road. It was claimed the cause of the breakage was\r\n  the digging away of the earth surrounding the conduit on the\r\n  one side, adjacent to the old aqueduct, and the piling of it up\r\n  on the other side, in connection with the widening of the old\r\n  channel.\r\n\r\n  It is stated that the pipe was thus caused to sag, crack and\r\n  eventually under the water pressure to break.\r\n\r\n  The rush of water carried away most of the earth left between\r\n  the conduit and the aqueduct, and it was into the latter,\r\n  fortunately, that the water flowed. If there can be a fortunate\r\n  side to the accident, it is that it occurred where it did, within\r\n  a couple of rods of the shack used by the construction company,\r\n  whose men were at work on the aqueduct, and where there was a\r\n  telephone, which greatly facilitated the ordering of supplies and\r\n  men.\r\n\r\n  By early morning on the 26th, a steel pipe, of six sections, and\r\n  slightly smaller in diameter than the conduit, had been ordered,\r\n  and Controller Godfrey had appeared on the scene, from which he\r\n  was thereafter never absent for more than a few hours.\r\n\r\n  But before the pipe could be placed, all the earth on the top of,\r\n  and to the north of the pipe had to be removed, and the remaining\r\n  and unbroken sides of the conduit demolished. While this work was\r\n  in progress, sections of the steel tube began to arrive and were\r\n  bolted together, so as to be ready to be swung into position as\r\n  soon as the place was cleared.\r\n\r\n  In the clearing operations, the engineers were also lucky, owing\r\n  to the close proximity of one of the Cooke Company’s derrick\r\n  steam shovels, which not only did the hard work of clearing the\r\n  ground expeditiously, but later supplied hot water for mixing the\r\n  cement, and steam to keep it warm while drying.\r\n\r\n  With Controller Godfrey either at work or bustling up the makers\r\n  of the steel tube, and City Engineer George Janin, and Waterworks\r\n  Engineer Lesage, continually at the scene of operations, by\r\n  Monday, December 29th, the background was cleared and the steel\r\n  pipe nearly completed.\r\n\r\n  By Tuesday, the latter had been swung into place, concrete had\r\n  been run in to fill the joints and workmen had been lowered into\r\n  the conduit, with buckets of blazing tar, to seal them inside.\r\n\r\n  On Wednesday, the 31st, at 4.45 A.M., the water was let into the\r\n  conduit and the pumps were started. They ran a few minutes when\r\n  the engineers were compelled to close them down because there\r\n  was not a sufficient depth of water in the conduit for them to\r\n  operate successfully. It was then found that the water had blown\r\n  out some of the filling of concrete, wood and tar, near the top\r\n  of the steel tube, and that a large leak had been formed which\r\n  would keep the city waterless over New Year’s Day.\r\n\r\n  Meanwhile various serious fires had occurred in the city, in\r\n  spite of the extra precautions taken by the fire commissioners\r\n  and the police, and Chief Tremblay of the fire department is\r\n  reported to have demanded at the City Hall that he be given\r\n  water, and to have stated that there was but enough water\r\n  remaining in the reservoirs for one big fire.\r\n\r\n  At the same time a number of foolish rumours gained credence,\r\n  such as that should the water not be forthcoming from the conduit\r\n  at once, the dam which holds the River St. Lawrence out from the\r\n  old aqueduct would be dynamited, and an even more destructive\r\n  rumor that the said dam was about to burst at any minute. Had\r\n  either of these eventualities occurred, as various engineers\r\n  pointed out, the whole of Point St. Charles would have been\r\n  flooded.\r\n\r\n  On Wednesday afternoon, about 4 o’clock, hot concrete was run\r\n  into the joints at both ends of the steel tube, and it was\r\n  announced that after allowing four hours for pouring and fifteen\r\n  hours for drying, the water would be let into the conduit and all\r\n  would be well.\r\n\r\n  Thursday, however, still saw the engineers waiting all day for\r\n  the concrete to set, while a pipe from the derrick up on the\r\n  embankment above discharged steam into a canvas outer covering to\r\n  the joint, and through a man-hole in the tube into the interior\r\n  of the conduit.\r\n\r\n  On Friday morning, the eighth day from the break, Controller\r\n  Godfrey, City Engineers Janin and Lesage, Engineer Herlihy, of\r\n  the Cooke Construction Company, and J.E. Jamieson, of grain\r\n  elevator fame, who had also been called in by the city for\r\n  consultation, made an inspection of the repairs, and were at\r\n  first inclined to the belief that all was well, and, in fact,\r\n  issued a statement that water should be in the city by noon or 1\r\n  o’clock.\r\n\r\n  But a close internal examination revealed the fact that the\r\n  concrete was yet not dry, so in order to prevent the waste of\r\n  more time waiting for it, it was decided to cover it with oakum\r\n  and pitch, and then to erect a wooden bulkhead or flange around\r\n  the end of the steel tube inside the conduit to prevent the water\r\n  from getting at the concrete with any force. It was here that the\r\n  advantage of the telephone so near the work was evidenced, for a\r\n  very short time only elapsed between the ordering of the oakum\r\n  and its delivery.\r\n\r\n  The process of covering the soft concrete with its protection and\r\n  erecting the bulkhead occupied most of Friday, and it was with\r\n  some degree of fear and trembling that the engineers in charge\r\n  ordered the water turned on at the intake at 6.45 P.M. This was\r\n  done very, very gently, and so prepared were those responsible\r\n  for another breakdown that it was definitely stated that should\r\n  it occur, the pipe would be opened and the water allowed to flow\r\n  into the old aqueduct.\r\n\r\n  However, all went well, and the first water reached the pumping\r\n  station at Point St. Charles at a few minutes past 8 P.M. Within\r\n  half an hour the first pump was started up, and at 9.50 the\r\n  pressure was reported to be seventy pounds. By 11 o’clock the\r\n  water was up to the Milton Street level, and three-quarters of an\r\n  hour after 6, seven of the pumps were hard at work, and pumping\r\n  at the rate of 56,000,000 gallons a day. Before breakfast on\r\n  Saturday morning the McTavish reservoir was full, and every house\r\n  had its full complement of water.\r\n\r\n  During the period of stress, there is not a doubt everyone\r\n  connected with the repair work, and, for that matter, all those\r\n  engaged in supplying the water to householders from sleighs,\r\n  worked to their utmost capacity, in spite of considerable\r\n  external difficulties.\r\n\r\n  At present Montreal’s city waterworks are supplied by a\r\n  very-much-criticised concrete conduit, with a 60-foot length of\r\n  steel tube of a considerably smaller diameter let into it where\r\n  the break occurred. But at the time of writing, at least, the\r\n  city has got water.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[1] The Précis in Doctor Brymner’s Archivist’s report for 1892\r\nhas been used above.\r\n\r\n[2] These were John Gray, Daniel Sutherland, Thomas Schieffelin\r\nand Stephen Sewell.\r\n\r\n[3] Writing in 1839, the author of “Hochelaga Depicta” says,\r\n“Montreal is better supplied with water than any other city on\r\nthis continent with the exception of Philadelphia.”\r\n\r\n[4] Montreal Daily Star, January 5, 1914.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                          CHAPTER XXXII\r\n\r\n                          LAW AND ORDER\r\n\r\n        JAILS--POLICE SERVICES--COURTHOUSE--LAW OFFICERS\r\n\r\n  EARLY PUNISHMENTS--FIRST CASES OF THE MAGISTRATES--GEORGE THE\r\n    “NAGRE”--“EXECUTION FOR MURDER”--OTHER CRIMES PUNISHED BY\r\n    DEATH--SOLDIER DESERTIONS--A PUBLIC EXECUTION--THE JAILS--THE\r\n    JAIL TAX TROUBLES--OBNOXIOUS TOASTS--THE NEW JAIL OF 1836--ITS\r\n    POPULATIONS--THE NEW BORDEAUX PRISON--OTHER SUPPLEMENTARY\r\n    PRISONS--THE EARLY POLICING OF MONTREAL--THE LOCAL POLICE\r\n    FORCE OF 1815--THE POLICE FORCE AFTER THE REBELLION OF\r\n    1837-1838--POLICE CHIEFS--MODERN LAW COURTS AND JUDGES--THE\r\n    HISTORY OF THE BAR--THE BAR ASSOCIATIONS OF MONTREAL--THE\r\n    RECORDERS--THE ARCHIVES.\r\n\r\n  SUPPLEMENT--THE JUDGES OF THE HIGHER COURTS FROM 1764 TO\r\n    1914--THE SHERIFFS OF MONTREAL--THE PROTHONOTARIES--THE\r\n    COURTHOUSE SITES--THE BATONNIERS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe early execution of the law in Montreal under British rule has\r\nbeen indicated in the chapters on the military government which\r\nlasted until 1764, when the magistrates or justices of the peace\r\nruled the city till nearly up to the Union. Their first case was\r\none of battery and assault.\r\n\r\nAt the May meeting of 1765 the first felony case was adjudicated.\r\nA man and his wife and a negro had been stealing. The sentence\r\nof “William and Elinor March and George, the Nagre” is thus\r\nrecorded: “They are to go back to the place of their confinement,\r\nthe said William to be stripped to the waist and Elinor March to\r\nhave her back only stripped, and the said George the Nagre and\r\neach tyed to the carttail and beginning at the jail or prison\r\nbetween the hours of 8 and 9 o’clock in the forenoon on Friday\r\nnext, are to proceed along around by the Intendant’s and then go\r\nto Market Place and round by St. Francis Street and through the\r\nParade to place begun at, during which round they are to receive\r\ntwenty-five stripes each on the naked back, besides twenty-five\r\neach on the naked back when at the market place.”\r\n\r\nNext month “George, the Nagre,” was up again for stealing two\r\npieces of silk ribbon, the justices being John Dumas, Daniel\r\nRobertson and Isaac Todd. He was sentenced again to be flogged\r\nwith a cat of nine tails on his march around at the carttail six\r\ntimes with ten stripes each.\r\n\r\nAt the sitting of the court for August 2, 1765, a French woman\r\nnamed Margaret Tourangeau was “Set for an hour in the stocks for\r\nstealing a piece of camblet.”\r\n\r\n“It is remarkable,” quotes Borthwick (History and Gazetteer,\r\npage 17), “that in the records of courts of sessions for years\r\nafter the conquest of the country as natural there are very few\r\nFrench names before the magistrates for those crimes for which\r\npunishment by whipping, the stocks or the pillory or branding\r\non the hand was meted out. This shows how thoroughly they\r\nobeyed their curés to respect the laws and be faithful to their\r\nallegiance.”\r\n\r\nIn the Court of King’s Bench, September, 1781, is recorded the\r\nfirst murderer to be hanged in the history of this Province since\r\nthe cession, William Blunt.\r\n\r\nBeing placed in the stocks with a paper label on the breast and\r\n“burning in the hand” were common forms of punishment during this\r\nperiod.\r\n\r\nThe latter punishment was thus inflicted: The prisoner was\r\nbrought from the gaol into the courtroom, and made firm by an\r\niron hand at the back of the dock, the palm part of his own hand\r\nbeing opened tightly. The red hot iron, sometimes ending either\r\nin a crown or some other device, was held ready by the common\r\nhangman, and the punishment was inflicted in the center of the\r\npalm. The instrument being ready, the prisoner is informed that\r\nthe moment it touches his flesh he can repeat as fast as he can\r\nthese words in French, “Vive le Roi” three times, and at the end\r\nof the third repetition, the punishment would cease, or the words\r\n“God Save the King” if he were an English prisoner.\r\n\r\nEven in this short time the hot iron has hissed into the flesh,\r\nand made such a mark that all the waters of the St. Lawrence\r\ncould not efface it. (Cf. Borthwick’s Gazetteer.)\r\n\r\nThe Montreal prisons of the past, especially before 1840, saw\r\nmany sad men who were condemned to death for crimes not so\r\npunished today, as a glance at some of the principal events\r\nrecorded in the Court of King’s and Queen’s Bench from 1812 to\r\n1838 will show.\r\n\r\nCases of executions for (1) stealing, larceny, shop lifting,\r\nburglary, 20; (2) horsestealing, 10; (3) rape, 3; (4) highway\r\nrobbery, 1; (5) sacrilege, 1; (6) forgery, 1.\r\n\r\nAfter 1821, although the records give the sentence of hanging for\r\nthe above crimes, we find that although it is often executed, yet\r\nthere is frequent mention of “pardoned by the king,” “respited,”\r\n“transported (so many) years in prison,” “pillory,” and “lashes.”\r\nOne burglar sentenced to be hanged is respited and sent for\r\nfive years to Quebec! It is strange to find cases of murder and\r\nmanslaughter punished thus: “Murder, to be burned in the hand;”\r\n“drowning a man, six months in jail and to be burned in the hand\r\nin open court.” One of those executed in 1813 for stealing a cow\r\nwas B. Clement, a boy of thirteen and a half years of age.\r\n\r\nIn 1818, March term, L. Bourguignon, convicted of grand larceny\r\nand condemned to be hanged, “prays for the benefit of the\r\nclergy,” which being granted by the court, he is sentenced to\r\ntwo-years’ House of Correction.\r\n\r\nDesertion or attempt at desertion among the soldiers stationed\r\nin the Montreal district was not uncommon in 1838, after the\r\nfirst curl revolt of 1837. Transportation for a term of fourteen,\r\ntwenty-one years, or “for the period of his natural life” was the\r\nsentence meted out to the “felon” who was marked with a D for\r\ndeserter. A few records of deserting will suffice:\r\n\r\nFifteenth of May, 1838: Fourteen soldiers, deserters, under\r\nsentence of transportation, sent to Mr. Waud, Jailor, under\r\ncharge of officer of Thirty-fourth Regiment.\r\n\r\nEleventh July: Three soldiers sentenced to fourteen, twenty-one,\r\nand twenty-one years’ transportation by G.A. Wetherall,\r\ncommanding officer of the Second Battalion, “The Royal.” Three\r\nfor a term of “natural life”--the Seventy-first Regiment.\r\n\r\nFifth of August: Five soldiers of the Seventy-first Regiment,\r\nfourteen years.\r\n\r\nThird of September: Two of the Fifteenth Regiment, fourteen and\r\nseven years. Three of the Seventy-first Regiment, fourteen years\r\nand all marked D.\r\n\r\nIn May, 1839, no less than twenty-four soldiers were committed\r\nat one time for desertion, by order of the town major; five were\r\ndischarged, the remainder were transported. These belonged to the\r\nEighty-fifth and Thirty-second Regiments.\r\n\r\nIt is not our purpose to record the gruesome punishments further.\r\nThere are, however, living with us those who have heard from\r\ntheir fathers the days in the ’20s when hangings were conducted\r\nin public in the yard of the old jail close to the Champ de Mars.\r\nThe following description is from a lady eyewitness still living\r\nin 1914:\r\n\r\n“You know, Mr. Robert Watson, a flour inspector, and a fine\r\ngentleman, was shot dead in his own house by a man whose name I\r\ncannot recall. That was, I think, in the twenties. The man was\r\narrested, tried and found guilty on circumstantial evidence,\r\nwhich was principally the fact that his boots corresponded to the\r\nfootmarks found in the snow leading to Mr. Watson’s residence. At\r\nthe same time there was a French-Canadian tried and sentenced to\r\ndeath for forgery, and sheep stealing, which were then capital\r\noffenses. I determined to see the hangings. I know you will think\r\nme queer, but I had a desire to go. Hangings were then conducted\r\nin public. I remember the crowd in the jail yard as well as\r\nif it was yesterday--men and women and girls like myself. The\r\nauthorities had allowed as many as the yard would hold, but there\r\nwere hundreds outside who could see nearly as well.\r\n\r\n“The Irishman asked for three cheers for the Irish, and said,\r\n‘Take off your hats for the Irishman.’ The people did as he\r\nasked. The Frenchman said he had sold his body to the students,\r\nand that he was ready to die like a man. He asked the women to\r\ncome up that he might pull their ears off, for when he began to\r\nsteal his mother never corrected him, and therefore he was on the\r\nscaffold. Then I fainted, the first and only time in my life. I\r\nwas sorry I went.”\r\n\r\n\r\n                              JAILS\r\n\r\nThe jail[1] used in the latter part of French régime and the\r\nearly portion of English rule was situated on the site formerly\r\nknown as the Crystal Block (now represented by the second\r\nbuilding northwest of St. Lawrence Street), on Notre Dame Street.\r\nOn the occupation of the British, the Jesuits’ residence, on\r\nNotre Dame Street, on the site facing what is now Jacques\r\nCartier Square, was confiscated and in 1773 used as a jail as\r\nwell as a courthouse. Not being designed for a jail, it is not\r\nsurprising that the grand jury at the Court of King’s Bench\r\nheld on the 2d of September, 1782, presented in their statement\r\nthat the jail “is very insufficient for the purpose of a civil\r\nprison, is in a ruinous condition and is becoming a nuisance to\r\nthe public and dangerous to the health and lives as well of the\r\npersons confined therein as others, his Majesty’s subjects. That\r\nit is insufficient for the purposes of a civil prison will appear\r\non considering that there are but three small apartments into\r\nwhich are put prisoners of both sexes, and every denomination,\r\nwhether for debt, breaches of the peace or the most flagrant\r\ncrimes, and on the representation of the sheriff of the district\r\nto their honours, the judges of the court of common pleas, on\r\nthe insufficiency of the prison, they have thought proper to\r\norder that executions should not issue against the persons of\r\ndebtors who, by the laws of the Province, may become subject to\r\nimprisonment.”\r\n\r\nIn 1787 a committee of the legislative council was appointed by\r\nLord Dorchester to investigate into the past administration of\r\njustice in the Province of Quebec. A committee of merchants of\r\nMontreal in a report to this commission, dated the 23d of June,\r\n1787, stated in Article 8: “The want of a proper jail for the\r\ndistrict has long been complained of, and at divers times has\r\nbeen represented by different grand juries, as well as at the\r\ncourts of oyer and terminer and in the inferior courts of quarter\r\nsessions; but hitherto no remedy has been applied. The house\r\nwhich at present serves for a jail consists of four very small\r\nrooms in which are frequently confined promiscuously persons of\r\ndifferent sexes and for very different degrees of crime. The\r\nunfortunate debtor cannot have a room to himself, nor can the\r\nmalefactor, when preparing for the other world, be accommodated\r\nwith a place of retirement to deprecate the wrath of the offended\r\nDeity. The insufficiency of the jail, in point of security,\r\noccasions a guard of soldiers to be kept in the lower part of\r\nit and even with that precaution many atrocious offenders have\r\nescaped, insomuch that the sheriff of the district has refused to\r\nconfine debtors, unless the prosecutor offer to take upon himself\r\nthe risk of an escape. The situation of this insufficient jail\r\nheightens the sufferings of the persons whom the law dooms to\r\nimprisonment, offends every passerby in the warm season and is a\r\nnuisance to the neighbourhood.”\r\n\r\nThe fire in 1803, which swept this portion of the city, partially\r\ndestroyed the jail, and pending repairs a building was leased for\r\na temporary jail. Still procrastination prevailed.\r\n\r\nIn 1804 the grand jury of Montreal made another presentment\r\nstating: “that the present gaol is only the ruins of the former\r\none, which was burned, repaired and patched up in such a manner\r\nthat the prisoners are sheltered from the inclemency of the\r\nweather, but by no means prevented from going out whenever they\r\nfeel so inclined.” A report of the sheriff, Gray, shows that\r\nthe same building had existed under the French rule, that it\r\nhad then, as subsequently, suffered from fire and that although\r\nrecently the sum of £615 had been expended on repairs it was\r\nstill inadequate for the security of prisoners.\r\n\r\nIn 1805 an act was passed in the house of assembly by which\r\ncommissioners were appointed to have a jail erected in Montreal\r\nand Quebec, the cost to be restricted to £9,000 currency in each\r\ncase. It was high time. The act of 1805 was the result of these\r\nrepresentations.\r\n\r\nBut a discussion arose at once concerning the ways and means of\r\nraising the funds. The bill as prepared embodied a proposal for\r\nthe raising of funds through a tax on imports.[2] The merchants\r\nopposed this as directed against commerce and urged a land tax\r\nwhich the landholders in turn combatted. Petitions were sent by\r\nthe merchants against the bill and they asked to plead at the\r\nbar of the house. This was refused and the bill in its original\r\nform passed the upper house unanimously. The bill became law.\r\nThe merchants trading from London also intervened in a memorial\r\nprotesting against the import tax. Altogether there was a\r\nstrenuous fight. The feelings at Montreal rose high.\r\n\r\nThe Montreal Gazette of the period reported a meeting at Dillon’s\r\ntavern, Mr. Isaac Todd, a principal merchant, took the chair at a\r\ndinner and among others certain toasts were proposed which were\r\nthought by some members of the legislature to reflect on them,\r\nscandalously and libellously, and Mr. Todd and the printer of\r\nthe Gazette were declared by the session of 1806 to have been\r\nguilty of a high breach of the privileges of the house. The\r\nsergeant-at-arms on attempting to make an arrest in Montreal\r\nfound both of them absent, and the matter dropped. Some of the\r\nobnoxious toasts were as follows:\r\n\r\n“Our representatives in the provincial parliament, who proposed\r\na constitutional and proper mode of taxation for building gaols,\r\nand who opposed a tax on commerce for that purpose as contrary to\r\nthe sound practice of the parent state;”\r\n\r\n“May our representatives be actuated by a patriotic spirit for\r\nthe good of the Province as dependent on the British Empire and\r\nbe divested of local prejudices;”\r\n\r\n“May the city of Montreal be enabled to support a new paper,\r\nthough deprived of its natural and useful advantages, apparently\r\nfor the benefit of an _individual_” (sic);\r\n\r\n“May the commercial interest of this Province have its\r\ndue influence on the administration of its government.”\r\n(Christie--“History of Canada,” p. 239.)\r\n\r\nThe next jail was finally built in 1808 adjoining the east side\r\nof the courthouse erected in 1800, but becoming too small a more\r\nsuitable one was commenced in 1831 at the foot of St. Mary’s\r\ncurrent on ground purchased from the heirs of Sir John Johnson.\r\nIt was not taken possession of by the sheriff till 1836. It\r\nwas not built on hygienic or practical lines and in 1852 the\r\nnortheast wing had to be demolished. It soon became very much\r\noccupied by the rebels and political prisoners of 1837 and\r\n1838.[3]\r\n\r\nThe former prison was occupied as a house of industry from 1836\r\nto 1838, when it became the government barracks. In the summer\r\nof 1849 the old jail built like the courthouse on the site of\r\nthe Jesuits’ estate was pulled down. The cornerstone was found\r\nwith two plates, the first recording the laying of the foundation\r\nstone of the Jesuit residence in 1742 by M. Normand, superior\r\nof the seminary, and the other recording that of the prison by\r\nPeter Panet, Isaac Ogden, “_honorabiles judices_,” and Joseph\r\nFrobisher, _armiger_.\r\n\r\nIn 1870, the prison, opened in 1836, was already being found too\r\nsmall and its overcrowded state had been frequently protested\r\nagainst by many grand juries. The theoretic capacity for this\r\nprison was 225 persons. It managed to hold 552 at one time.\r\nIn 1876 the women prisoners were removed. It continued to be\r\nused for its original purpose till lately when the new prison\r\nat Bordeaux was opened in 1912, the last contingent being\r\ntransferred from the old prison in August, 1913.\r\n\r\nThe following is a table of the population of the prisoners in\r\nthe old prison:\r\n\r\n  1836 Men and women      162\r\n  1846 Men and women    1,275\r\n  1856 Men and women    1,792\r\n  1866 Men and women    4,410\r\n  1876 Men and women    3,969\r\n  1886 Men only         2,156\r\n  1896 Men only         4,132\r\n  1906 Men only         3,130\r\n  1908 Men only         4,854\r\n  1909 Men only         4,287\r\n  1910 Men only         4,702\r\n  1911 Men only         5,344\r\n\r\nIn November, 1912, the transmigration to Bordeaux began and the\r\ncongestion was relieved. The site of the new prison comprises a\r\nsuperficies of twenty arpents, and the buildings are eminently\r\nwell fitted for their purpose, hygienic and spacious, with none\r\nof the faults so bitterly deplored in the old jails.\r\n\r\nThe supplementary prisons, in 1914, are the women’s jail at\r\nFullum Street, established about 1876, under the “Good Shepherd”\r\ncommunity, which has sections for Catholics and Protestants\r\n(four non-Catholics), the detention house for juvenile delinquents,\r\nin connection with the Juvenile Court, erected by the Juvenile\r\nDelinquent act of 1910, established March 12, 1912, the reformatory\r\nschool at De Montigny Street undertaken by Brothers of St. Vincent\r\nde Paul, the boys’ farm reformatory at Shawbridge for Protestants,\r\nthat for Catholic girls at the House of the “Good Shepherd” on\r\nSherbrooke Street, and another for Protestants, commenced at St.\r\nLambert’s about 1912. There is also for long terms of two years\r\nand over a large penitentiary under the Federal Government at St.\r\nVincent de Paul.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        THE POLICE FORCES\r\n\r\nThe policing or the control of law and order in general\r\nof Montreal dates back to the 27th of January, 1663, when\r\nMaisonneuve founded a voluntary association under the name of\r\nthe “Police de la Sainte Famille de Jésus, Marie and Joseph,”\r\nwhich was divided into twenty companies of seven men each. In\r\n1667 Maisonneuve organized a more formal police force under the\r\ndirection of five important citizens who also acted as justices\r\nof the peace. In the early times it was also customary to\r\nchoose two or more citizens in each district of the town to act\r\nas constables.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE OLD JAIL]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PRISON AT BORDEAUX]\r\n\r\nIn 1815 the legislature authorized the organization of a local\r\npolice force. It was composed of twenty-five to thirty men who\r\ncarried a long baton painted blue, a lantern at their girdle, and\r\na bell to summon assistance. At night the watchmen called out\r\nthe hour and other, cheerful news such as “All’s well--past 1\r\no’clock and a starlit night.” When lamps were introduced it was\r\ntheir business to light them. They had multifarious duties, such\r\nas looking after the health regulations, the removal of snow,\r\nthe quelling of riots, especially at elections, when frequently\r\nthe military had to be called out to assist them. Even then a\r\npoliceman’s lot was not a happy one, being also very inadequately\r\nremunerated.\r\n\r\nAfter the troubles of 1837-8 the special council of the\r\nlegislature of Lower Canada passed an ordinance to authorize the\r\ngovernor to name an inspector or a superintendent of police for\r\nthe city of Montreal. This superintendent was similar in power to\r\na justice of the peace. He had, in addition, the charge of the\r\ncomposition and the control of the police force, subject to the\r\nprovincial secretary. The force consisted of thirty constables,\r\npaid by the government. They were supplemented by a special force\r\nfrom the police appointed by the governor and paid by the harbour\r\ncommissioners. That the new police was badly needed, a picture\r\nfrom “Hochelaga Depicta,” written in 1839, makes clear. “The\r\npassions drawn forth by the rebellion have disturbed the repose\r\nof many, and military habits and pursuits have not only diverted\r\nthem from their regular course of action, but have introduced\r\na martial and unsettled spirit which has operated unfavourably\r\nupon a large portion of the community. It is to be regretted that\r\nmany of the regular troops are from time to time seen reeling in\r\nthe streets, to the interruption of that good order which their\r\nservices are so efficient in promoting; and that intemperance\r\nhas increased among the volunteers since they received pay.”\r\n(“Hochelaga Depicta,” p. 212.)\r\n\r\nThe police force was organized in consequence of an ordinance\r\nissued during the administration of the Earl of Durham on the\r\n28th of June, 1838. It consisted of 102 privates, four mounted\r\npatrols, six sergeants and six corporals under the command of\r\nfour officers, viz., Capt. Alexander Comeau and Lieutenant Worth\r\nfor Division A, and Capt. William Brown and Lieut. William\r\nSuter for Division B. The expenses were borne by the civil home\r\ngovernment and amounted “to at least six thousand pounds per\r\nannum.” (Cf. “Hochelaga Depicta.” 181.)\r\n\r\nAfter the rebellion in the early days of Queen Victoria’s reign\r\nthe office of superintendent was abolished and a “Fire Society”\r\nwas established by the special council, with power to create a\r\nbody of officers of the peace. The name suggests that protection\r\nagainst fire was more important those days than against other\r\nevils. The force consisted then of 102 men, four mounted patrols,\r\nsix sergeants, six corporals under the command of four officers.\r\nThe government supported this expense, which amounted annually\r\nto about six thousand pounds. In 1851, after the burning of the\r\nparliament house and the Gavazzi riots, the powers of the Fire\r\nSociety passed into operation under the municipal authorities.\r\nThe constables were increased to 100. The chief of police was\r\nMr. Hayes. The central station was in the basement of Bonsecours\r\nMarket and another post was the corner of Craig and Bleury\r\nstreets. The police had not an enviable reputation. The pay was\r\nonly 50 cents a day. Often recruits for the service were obtained\r\nfrom the prisoners. Drunkenness was charged to them so that a\r\nfine of 5 shillings was imposed on all who sold intoxicating\r\nliquors to any of the force.\r\n\r\nIn 1861 Guillaume Lamothe became chief of police and after\r\nsome years’ agitation he succeeded in obtaining $1.00 a day\r\npay for his men. Mr. Lamothe, alarmed at the growth of houses\r\nof prostitution at this period, suggested in his annual report\r\nof 1863 the license of a certain number so as to regulate the\r\nevil.[4] The recorder, De Montigny, supported this, but on the\r\nprotest of the religious authorities of the town the innovation\r\nwas discountenanced.\r\n\r\nIn 1870 the military were removed from the garrison and the\r\nrecords show an improvement in the morality of the town.\r\n\r\nSince 1850 the chiefs of police have been: H. Jérémie, 1850;\r\nThomas McGrath, 1851; E.O. Ermatinger, 1854; J.N. Hayes, 1854;\r\nGuillaume Lamothe, 1861; P.W.L. Penton, 1865; H. Paradis, 1879;\r\nG.A. Hughes, 1888; D. Legault, 1901; O. Campeau (November), 1905.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    THE COURTS AND COURTHOUSE\r\n\r\nThe establishment of the higher courts has been treated in the\r\nchapters dealing with the constitutional growth of the city. It\r\nremains to indicate the present system as in vogue. Lawsuits in\r\npurely civil matters involving less than one hundred dollars and\r\nin which no future rights are involved, are settled by one of\r\nthe three judges of the circuit court or in a few cases of minor\r\nimportance by one of the City Recorders. The city recordership\r\nis an office peculiar to the Province of Quebec. It is attached\r\nto the City Hall and deals with minor offenses enforcing a part\r\nof the criminal law, enforcing payment of city licenses and is\r\na court of appeal for assessment charges, actions for wages and\r\ncivil cases not exceeding one hundred dollars, and minor cases\r\nof non-support and the duties of a domestic relations court. All\r\ncases dealing with children under sixteen years of age have been\r\nrelegated to the recently established juvenile court.\r\n\r\nCases of litigation involving $100 or over are decided by one\r\nof the judges of the superior court, from whose decision an\r\nappeal may be made either to the court of review, which is\r\npractically the first court of appeal (composed of three judges\r\nof the superior court, other than the judge rendering the first\r\ndecision), or to the court of king’s bench, consisting of five\r\njudges. There are now six judges of king’s bench, sixteen of the\r\nsuperior court, and four of the circuit court for the district\r\nof Montreal, which comprises the island of Montreal and the\r\ncounties of Laval, Soulanges, La Prairie, Chambly and Verchères.\r\nThe court of king’s bench is composed of six judges, one of whom\r\nis the chief justice of the Province of Quebec and five of whom\r\nhear appeals in civil and criminal matters for the Province for\r\ntwo weeks every month in the cities of Montreal and Quebec,\r\nalternately. They also preside over the sittings of the criminal\r\ncourt for the cities of Montreal and Quebec. Of late years the\r\nsalaries of the judges of the king’s bench for Montreal and\r\nQuebec are $8,000 for the chief justice and puisné judges at\r\n$7,000; those of the superior court, $8,000 for the chief justice\r\nand $7,000 each for the puisné judges, with a rider restricting\r\nall judges to the exclusive practice of their profession as\r\njudges. This limitation causes retirements after a number of\r\nyears for more remunerative posts. The bench is not a body\r\ncorporate, while the bar is. The first legislation was in 1785\r\n(25 George III, C. 4), regarding the appointment of advocates,\r\nattorneys, solicitors and notaries.\r\n\r\nThe first attempt of the bar of Montreal to acquire corporate\r\nexistence goes back to 1828, when on March 27th the members of\r\nthe bar, under the auspices of the court of king’s bench, then\r\ncomposed of Chief Justice Reid and of Justices A.F. Uniacke,\r\nGeorge Pyke and L.C. Foucher, organized themselves into a library\r\nassociation, the first board of management being composed of\r\nMessrs. Stephen Sewell, Joseph Bedard, Frederick Griffin, and\r\nAlexander Buchanan.\r\n\r\nThe association had a social circle as a scientific side and\r\npartook of the nature of a club. The admission fee was $200 and\r\nthe annual subscription was $5.00. It appears to have flourished.\r\n\r\nThe next legislative provision enacted regarding the bar was the\r\nenactment of 1836 (6 William IV, C. 10) regulating that those who\r\nhad followed a regular higher course of letters and had served\r\ntheir clerkship in a law firm were fit to be admitted to practice\r\nat the bar. The bar association of Montreal was incorporated\r\nin 1840 and the bar of Lower Canada in 1849. The title of\r\n_batonnier_ was given officially by act of 1849 to the president\r\nof the corporation. It comes from days as far back as 1342, when\r\nthe president of the Sodality of Lawyers carried a bâton, the\r\nemblem of St. Nicholas, their patron.\r\n\r\nThe act to incorporate the bar of Lower Canada was the gradual\r\ndissolution of the Library Association so that about a quarter\r\nof a century ago the library began to be considered by comity\r\nthe property of the bar. Since 1898 the Junior Bar Association\r\nhas been formed for the purpose of mutual information, interest\r\nand friendly relations with similar bodies abroad. About 1907\r\nthe Montreal Bar Association was founded “for the purpose\r\nof promoting the interest of the bar and of facilitating\r\nprofessional labours and of fostering friendly relations among\r\nits members.”\r\n\r\n\r\n                         THE COURTHOUSES\r\n\r\nThe courthouse used after the conquest was held in the Jesuit\r\nresidence confiscated by the government. On the 3d of January,\r\n1799, the sum of £5,000 was appropriated by the parliament for\r\nthe erection of a new courthouse and at the same time the ground\r\nwas granted by the government without any pecuniary indemnity. It\r\nwas built in 1800 at the cost of $25,000 upon part of the site\r\noccupied partially before by the chapel and residence of the\r\nJesuits. It contained many large halls and six fine vaults in\r\nwhich the notarial deeds and registers of births, marriages and\r\ndeaths were stored. In 1803 at the east end of this courthouse\r\nthere was built a prison which was partially demolished in 1849.\r\n\r\nIn 1844 the old courthouse was burnt. Until the present\r\ncourthouse was built the courts were held partially in the prison\r\nadjoining the Château de Ramezay. The present courthouse was\r\nopened for business in 1856 on the site of the old courthouse\r\nand the prison. What was left of the latter was demolished in\r\n1860 and a square was made between the garden of the government\r\nfronting the Château de Ramezay and on this place between the\r\nChamp de Mars and Notre Dame Street there was placed a fountain\r\nwith the statue of Neptune, since removed to Park Mance.\r\n\r\nIn the present courthouse there are kept the judiciary archives\r\nof the district of Montreal, which are certainly the richest of\r\nany district in the Dominion because nothing has been destroyed,\r\nso that all the notarial deeds and official papers from the times\r\nof Maisonneuve to our day are available. These archives occupy\r\na space on the basement floor of the courthouse of nearly three\r\nhundred by one hundred and twenty-five feet and also nearly half\r\nof the ground floor. Under the French régime the archives were\r\nunder the care of the governor and the seigneurs of the island.\r\nAfterwards they were at the old French courthouse at the corner\r\nof St. Francis Xavier and Notre Dame streets and they followed\r\nthe subsequent fortunes of the courthouse transmigrations. When\r\nthe courthouse was burnt in 1844 the only documents destroyed\r\nwere a part of the criminal court record. No systematic indexing\r\nand classification of the documents were undertaken before Doctor\r\nLemieux was named sheriff in 1910. As this office in Montreal\r\nembraces the administration and supervision of the courthouse\r\nand prison, it was to this sheriff’s zeal that in 1911, after\r\nmany demands, he succeeded in having a staff named under Mr. E.Z.\r\nMassicotte as the first archivist to put the archives department\r\non an efficient modern basis. This was done, comparing favourably\r\nwith the best kept contemporary archives in America. This was\r\nattested to by the visitors of the Great American Bar Congress\r\nheld in Montreal in 1913. While the archives in the courthouse\r\nrepresent the collection of all documents relating to the city\r\nanterior to the period of English rule and of all the judiciary\r\ncourts of the Montreal district since, including the preservation\r\nof the births, marriages, deaths and notarial deeds, there has\r\nlately been established in the city hall a municipal bureau\r\nof Archives under Mr. Beaudry, which preserves all documents\r\nconcerning the government of the city under the system of the\r\nJustices of the Peace and the modern municipal corporation of\r\nMontreal. The historians of the future will bless both these\r\nforward movements of recent years.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE OLD COURTHOUSE]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: COURTHOUSE AT MONTREAL]\r\n\r\n                           SUPPLEMENT\r\n\r\n        JUDGES OF THE COURT OF KINGS BENCH, LOWER CANADA\r\n\r\n  Date.

Those\r\nfor the sick have an interesting history, which may be told best\r\nin chronological order:\r\n\r\n\r\n                         THE HOTEL DIEU\r\n\r\nThe early history of the first hospital in Montreal has been told\r\nin the first volume. To recapitulate its history to the beginning\r\nof the English régime. It started on the first day of the\r\nfoundation of Montreal, May 17, 1642, when Jeanne Mance arrived\r\nwith the express purpose of founding a hospital, being helped\r\nthereto by funds provided by Madame de Bullion. Her first home\r\nadjoined to the château, shortly built in the fort inclosure, and\r\nthat little home, the Hôtel Dieu, built of logs, in 1644, at what\r\nis the North East corner of St. Paul Street, became the first\r\nof the infirmaries directed by her alone for seventeen years.\r\nThe Hôtel Dieu was not, however, completely founded until the\r\narrival, in October, 1659, of the three Hospitalier Sisters of\r\nSt. Joseph from La Flèche in Anjou, sent to her by M. Jerome de\r\nla Dauversière. These were Judith Moreau de Brésoles, Catherine\r\nMacé and Marie Maillet. This body had been established by de\r\nla Dauversière and Mlle. de la Ferré in 1642 for Montreal, and\r\nnow when the hour had arrived its representatives were received\r\nin the first Hôtel Dieu, the wooden building twenty-five feet\r\nsquare, which lasted fifty years on St. Paul Street. In 1666\r\nLouis XIV confirmed the establishment of the Hôtel Dieu by\r\nletters patent. In 1695 the Hôtel Dieu was razed to the ground by\r\nfire and the remains of Jeanne Mance consumed, but the hospital\r\nwas rebuilt on the same site. Fires again in 1721 and 1734\r\nattacked it. Still it rose from its ruins. In 1760, owing to the\r\nscarcity of barracks, Amherst’s troops took possession of the\r\nwest chapel, which had been commenced in 1656 and had served till\r\n1678 as the only place of worship for citizens and sick alike.\r\nIt was dismantled and turned into a stable. Years afterward the\r\nsister procureur of the Hôtel Dieu, came across the account of\r\nthe bill for the unpaid damages and sent it to Queen Victoria who\r\npromptly sent a check for the amount due. In 1852 the Hôtel Dieu\r\nestablished, in the college built originally by the Baptists and\r\nbought for $16,020.00, the branch hospital of St. Patrick’s on\r\nGuy Street, for the principal purpose of providing the Irish and\r\nEnglish Catholic population with English-speaking physicians and\r\nsisters.\r\n\r\nThe first physicians were Doctor David, Doctor Howard and Dr.\r\n(Sir William) W.H. Hingston. The work was discontinued about\r\n1860, when preparations were being made to open the present Hôtel\r\nDieu on Pine Avenue, and the building was opened on September 8,\r\n1860, by the Congregation Nuns as a convent school under the name\r\nof the “Pensionnat du Mont St. Marie.”\r\n\r\nOn account of the disasters from fires the statistics of the\r\nHôtel Dieu for the first century of its work are incomplete, but\r\nfrom 1760 to 1860 the exact number of cases of invalids admitted\r\nis 82,121. By 1909, when the 250th anniversary of the arrival of\r\nthe three Hospitaliers was celebrated, the number had mounted to\r\n119,352. In 1861 the Hôtel Dieu made its first great change, when\r\nit was transported from the corner of St. Paul and St. Sulpice\r\nStreet to its present location, Mont St. Famille on Pine Avenue.\r\nWhen it is remembered that the nuns are an inclosed order and\r\nnever leave their cloister or their grounds, to leave the old\r\nHôtel Dieu on St. Paul Street was like tearing themselves from\r\ntheir home to journey to a far-off land. Their consolation was to\r\ntake with them the remains of their sisters, buried there during\r\nthe preceding 200 years. The stones of the old chapel on St.\r\nJoseph (afterwards St. Sulpice Street) and St. Paul Street, were\r\ntaken to erect a little chapel dedicated to St. Joseph in the\r\nnew convent grounds. Since 1845 eight independent off-shoots of\r\nthe Hôtel Dieu have risen to carry on the work started in 1659,\r\nviz., at Kingston, Tracadie, Chatham, Madawaska, Campbellton,\r\nArthabaska, Windsor and Winooski. From the house of Kingston the\r\nHôtel Dieus of Cornwall and Chicago have sprung.\r\n\r\nSince the transition from St. Paul Street the Hôtel Dieu has\r\nbecome more and more of the nature of a public hospital, fully\r\nequipped and of the modern type. From 1857 to 1874 the Hospital\r\nprovided a home for old people of both sexes to the number\r\nof thirty-seven to forty a year. This was then left to other\r\nreligious bodies established for the purpose.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ANCIENT HOTEL-DIEU UP TO 1821 (ST. PAUL ST.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HOTEL-DIEU IN 1861]\r\n\r\nThe care of young orphans was not relinquished till 1890. Ninety\r\nto one hundred of these have been cared for annually. Outside\r\ntheir patients the nuns now only continue the maintenance of\r\nseventeen scholars who act as sanctuary boys in the services of\r\nthe chapel. Their functions are entirely occupied now with the\r\ncare of their sick. The next hospital in chronological order\r\nwould be the “Hôpital Général” originally founded by the Charron\r\nNères and reformed in 1747 by Madame d’Youville. But as this\r\ninstitution, still existing, is rather an asylum for the aged as\r\nwell as an institution for foundlings with the baby hospital work\r\nin connection, it will be treated elsewhere.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      THE GENERAL HOSPITAL\r\n\r\nThe General Hospital, the first general hospital under British\r\nrule, has, for many years, been perhaps the most popular of\r\nMontreal’s numerous charities. It owed its inception to the\r\ninspiration of Montreal ladies.\r\n\r\nIn the first annual report, it is stated that the increase of\r\npopulation and the great influx of emigrants from the United\r\nKingdom, rendered the Hôtel Dieu inadequate for the care of\r\nthe indigent sick, and further it was desirable to accommodate\r\npatients suffering from contagious diseases.\r\n\r\nIts history is as follows:\r\n\r\nAbout 1815 a band of ladies combined under the name of the\r\n“Ladies Benevolent Society” to meet the cases of destitute\r\nimmigrants occurring. By 1818 a fund of £1,200 was raised. A\r\nsmall house, thenceforth called the “House of Recovery,” was\r\nhired. This with its four rooms was attended by Doctor Blackwood,\r\na young retired army surgeon, with the assistance of others.\r\nVery soon a large house was secured on Craig Street, fitted\r\nup with three wards and made capable of receiving twenty-four\r\npatients. The movement now became popular. A public meeting was\r\ncalled. The idea of a “General Hospital” took hold. The medical\r\ndepartment was first under the control of four professional men\r\nin connection with the “Montréal Medical Institution,” which\r\nafterwards became the first medical faculty of McGill University.\r\n\r\nOn May 1, 1819, the patients were removed from the “House of\r\nRecovery” to the new building, which now assumed the name of\r\nthe Montreal General Hospital. About this time a site used as a\r\nnursery, on Dorchester Street, was up for sale. This lot then\r\n“in the suburbs, was chosen for its proximity to the town, and\r\nthe salubrity of the situation.” In view of erecting a hospital\r\nthereon it was purchased on the joint credit of the Hon. J.\r\nRichardson, the Honorable Mr. McGillivray and Mr. S. Gerrard. A\r\ncontract was signed for the new hospital early in January, 1821.\r\nThe Hon. J. Richardson, Rev. J. (Dean) Bethune, Doctor Robertson,\r\nJohn Molson, D. Ross, John Fry and A. Skakel, Esqs., were\r\nappointed a committee to superintend the work.\r\n\r\nThe corner-stone of the building was laid with Masonic ceremonies\r\non the 6th of June, 1821, and the building was opened for the\r\nreception of patients on the 1st of May, 1822, the cost of the\r\nerection being £4,556 currency. This building, which is now\r\nrepresented by the entrance hall and rooms above, was designed to\r\naccommodate seventy-two patients.\r\n\r\nThe subsequent history consists chiefly in the addition of block\r\nafter block of buildings to the original small stone central\r\nedifice, each addition being named after a generous donor or\r\nhonoured citizen.\r\n\r\nOn the death of the Hon. John Richardson, the first president,\r\nit was resolved to perpetuate his name and connection with\r\nthe Hospital by the addition of a wing to be named after him.\r\nA generous response was made by the public, and in 1832 the\r\nbuilding attached to the east end of the original structure was\r\nopened for the reception of patients.\r\n\r\nIn 1848 the widow of Chief Justice Reid signified her intention\r\nof adding a wing corresponding with the first, to be named after\r\nher deceased husband.\r\n\r\nSpecial provision was made for the treatment of children by the\r\nerection of the Morland wing, in rear of the Reid wing. This\r\nbuilding was added in memory of Mr. Thomas Morland, an active\r\nmember of the Committee of Management, and was opened in 1874. It\r\ncontained rooms afterwards utilized for outdoor patients, private\r\nwards, and accommodation for servants, which was subsequently\r\ntransformed to a female ward.\r\n\r\nIn accordance with the views of the founders of the Hospital,\r\naccommodation was long provided for patients suffering from\r\ninfectious fevers. Cases of smallpox, typhus, scarlatina,\r\ndiphtheria and measles, were for years accommodated in the\r\ncentral building or its wings. During the great epidemic of\r\ntyphus or as it was better known, ship fever, brought to the\r\ncountry chiefly by Irish immigrants, the Hospital capacity was\r\ntaxed to its utmost, and temporary sheds had to be erected for\r\nthe accommodation of the sufferers. In the years 1831-32, 1832-33\r\nand 1847-48, 5,631 patients were admitted of whom 3,458 suffered\r\nfrom fever. Doctor Howard, in his report, states that over half\r\nthe fever patients were cases of typhus.\r\n\r\nSmallpox again, which in former years was very prevalent in\r\nMontreal, was treated in special wards of the Hospital. Owing\r\nto the disease spreading to other patients a brick building\r\nafterwards used as a kitchen and laundry, was constructed in the\r\nrear of the Richardson wing. Half the cost of this structure\r\nwas generously donated by Mr. Wm. Molson; the building was\r\nused for infectious cases up to 1894. At that time, after many\r\napplications and much pressure from the governors, the city\r\nundertook to subscribe $6,000 annually to the Hospital to defray\r\nthe expense of providing for infectious disease. Two houses were\r\nutilized for a year in the neighbourhood, and the department was\r\nthen moved to the Civic Hospital, on Moreau Street. Half this\r\nbuilding is controlled by the General Hospital and is supported\r\nfinancially by the city.\r\n\r\nTwo surgical pavilions and a large operating theatre were opened\r\nfor use in December, 1892. Mr. George Stephen, afterwards Lord\r\nMount Stephen, one of the generous donors of the Royal Victoria\r\nHospital, contributed $50,000 in memory of the late Dr. G.W.\r\nCampbell, formerly dean of McGill Medical Faculty, and a bequest\r\nfrom Mr. David Greenshields of $40,000 was also utilised in\r\nadding these wings. From that time accommodation for surgical\r\ncases has been excellent. The old part of the Hospital was,\r\nhowever, in a very unsatisfactory state. The wards were small and\r\nthe building antiquated. Lack of funds only had long prevented a\r\nradical change being made in this block. The president, Mr. F.\r\nWolferstan Thomas, set himself the task of collecting funds to\r\nrenovate this part of the building and to render it in keeping\r\nwith the surgical side. As the outcome of his untiring work in\r\naid of the Hospital $100,000 was collected. The interior of the\r\nold building was pulled down and it was skillfully remodelled,\r\nunder the direction of Mr. A.T. Taylor, for the accommodation of\r\nmedical, gynæcological and ophthalmic patients, the old operating\r\nroom being retained as a medical lecture, and gynæcological\r\noperating theatre.\r\n\r\nIt was evidently the intention of the founders of the Hospital\r\nto provide for proper nursing so far as was possible, before\r\nthe advent of Florence Nightingale. We read in the first annual\r\nreport, among other rules, that the nurse, on admission of a\r\npatient, “shall immediately wash his or her face and hands, neck\r\nand arms, feet and legs, with tepid water; she shall give him or\r\nher (if he or she have none) an hospital shirt and night-cap.”\r\nAgain they are instructed to keep themselves clean and decently\r\nclothed, and to be diligent in complying with the orders of\r\nthe medical officers, surgeon and matron. Surely we have here\r\ninculcated two important duties of the modern nurse, cleanliness\r\nand obedience.\r\n\r\nIn 1890 the present successful school of nurses was established\r\nand in 1897 the Jubilee Nursing Home on the hospital grounds was\r\nbeing erected, while in 1913 a large annex was added to meet the\r\ngrowing demands of the population on the charity of the Hospital.\r\n\r\n\r\n                     THE NOTRE DAME HOSPITAL\r\n\r\nThis institution is situated n Notre Dame Street, near the\r\neastern Canadian Pacific Railway station, in a populous\r\ncommercial and manufacturing centre, and in close proximity to\r\nthe harbour.\r\n\r\nIt was founded in 1880. The branch of the Laval Medical Faculty,\r\nestablished in Montreal in 1877, had no hospital, its professors\r\nand students being excluded from the Hôtel Dieu, on account of\r\nthe difficulties that had arisen between the Faculty and the\r\nMontreal School of Medicine and Surgery, the latter holding the\r\nHôtel Dieu. Knowing that a hospital was greatly needed in the\r\ncommercial and manufacturing part of the city, and would afford\r\nabundant clinical material, the professors undertook to found\r\nNotre Dame Hospital.\r\n\r\nDr. E. Persillier-Lachapelle, taking the lead, obtained the\r\nco-operation of the Rev. Victor Rousselot, of the Seminary of St.\r\nSulpice, who assumed half the financial responsibility of the\r\nenterprise, the professors taking the other half.\r\n\r\nThe co-operation of the Sisters of Charity (Grey Nuns) was next\r\nobtained to care for the sick and see to the internal economy of\r\nthe Hospital.\r\n\r\nThe old Donegani Hotel was rented, and the contracts for\r\nrepairing, renovating and furnishing the building granted; and\r\non the 1st of July, 1880, the Hospital, with fifty beds, was\r\ninaugurated. In 1881 it was incorporated, the corporation being\r\nunder the direction of a Medical Board, a Board of Governors and\r\na Board of Management. Later on the Hospital became possessor\r\nof the Donegana Hotel and the adjoining estates on each side,\r\nand gradually completed the important repairs and renovations\r\nrequisite to adapt those buildings to the needs of the\r\ninstitution.\r\n\r\nIts presidents were successively: Hon. L.J. Forget, Hon. J.R.\r\nThibaudeau, Mr. C.P. Hébert, and Hon. L.O. Loranger.\r\n\r\nThe first superntendent and adviser of the Hospital was Dr.\r\nE.P. Lachapelle, who filled the position for many years, being\r\nsucceeded by Dr. L. de Lothbinière Harwood.\r\n\r\nThe citizens of Montreal and the public generally have always\r\ncontributed liberally to the maintenance of the institution.\r\nThe ladies of Montreal, fully interested in the good work to be\r\ndone, founded an association--The Lady Patronesses of Notre Dame\r\nHospital--to co-operate more effectively with the directors.\r\n\r\nThe Hospital to-day contains 150 beds, the greater number of\r\nwhich are devoted to the poor and unfortunate sick of all races\r\nand creeds.\r\n\r\nBesides the wards there is an outdoor department, comprising\r\ndispensaries for general medicine, surgery, eye, nose, throat and\r\near diseases, diseases of women, diseases of the skin, diseases\r\nof children and nervous diseases.\r\n\r\nIn the Hospital proper, there are men’s and women’s wards for\r\nsurgery, medicine, ophthalmology and gynæcology. There is a\r\npathological laboratory in the hospital as well as an electrical\r\nand radiological one. An ambulance service does active work,\r\nsuccouring the sick and injured, and providing the Hospital with\r\nabundant clinical cases. The whole of this varied and practical\r\nclinical material is classified and utilized by the Faculty for\r\nthe graded and thorough instruction of its students. The medical\r\nservice is directed by a bureau of thirty-two physicians. The\r\nGrey Nuns are in charge of the hospital nursing department. The\r\nhospital has now an annex being constructed on Sherbrooke Street,\r\nfacing Park Lafontaine. By its side is the hospital of St. Paul\r\nfor contagious diseases.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        WESTERN HOSPITAL\r\n\r\nThis hospital was first projected in 1871, the year in which\r\nthe Medical Faculty[1] of Bishops College was established. For\r\nsome time previously the want of a hospital in the West End had\r\nbeen felt and spoken of, but further than this no action was\r\ntaken. When Bishops Medical Faculty was in its inception, it was\r\nfeared they might not get full facilities for their students in\r\nthe existing hospitals. Circumstances which occurred seemed to\r\nindicate that this would be realized. As a result a friend of\r\nBishops College, Major Mills, offered to give $12,000 to build\r\na western hospital. This donation was put in writing by Doctor\r\nWilkins, then in Bishops, and signed by Major Mills, and an\r\nactive canvass commenced. In a short time $30,000 was subscribed,\r\nthe charter for incorporation was assented to on January 20,\r\n1874, the present site purchased, and on the 29th June, 1876, the\r\nfoundation stone of the first building was laid with appropriate\r\nceremony. It is not required to notice the vicissitudes, which\r\nthe building met with, beyond stating that for several years it\r\nremained unfinished. When at last completed, the Western Hospital\r\nCorporation was not in position to commence hospital work. It\r\nwas leased, in 1884, by the Women’s Hospital, the charter of\r\nwhich was owned by the Medical Faculty of Bishops and opened for\r\nhospital work, there being two departments--a Gynæcological and\r\na Maternity. A most successful work was done by this hospital\r\nwhen, in 1895, the marked growth of the city westward seemed to\r\nindicate that the time had arrived for putting the building to\r\nits original purpose, that of a general hospital. The lease with\r\nthe Women’s Hospital was therefore cancelled by mutual consent,\r\nand in the fall of 1895, the Western Hospital, as a general\r\nhospital, began its active work. The ground owned by the Hospital\r\nCorporation is nearly three acres in extent, and is bounded by\r\nfour streets, one being an avenue of over one hundred feet wide.\r\nThis avenue leads directly to many of the large manufactories in\r\nthe West End, and they furnish the Hospital with a large amount\r\nof its surgical work.\r\n\r\nIn 1907 the charter was altered and the new building was erected,\r\nthe old one becoming the nurse’s home. The late Mr. Peter Lyale\r\nwas the president at the time, having been in that office from\r\n1906 to his death in 1912. He was succeeded by Mr. D. Lorne\r\nMcGibbon.\r\n\r\n\r\n                   THE ROYAL VICTORIA HOSPITAL\r\n\r\nThe Royal Victoria Hospital received its name in commemoration of\r\nthe jubilee of Queen Victoria in 1887, in memory of which it was\r\nfounded in that year.\r\n\r\nOn the 2d of December, 1893, His Excellency the Governor General\r\nassisted at the inauguration of the new hospital, which was\r\ndevoted, by Lord Mount Stephen and Sir Donald Smith, K.C.M.G.,\r\netc., to the cure of the sick, of whatever race or creed, to\r\nthe training of nurses, and to the furtherance of science. The\r\nbuilding is erected within a lot of eighteen acres, purchased\r\nby the founders for $90,000, to which another five acres, held\r\nunder long lease from the city, make a convenient addition. It\r\nstands on part of the Mountain Park and faces on Pine Avenue and\r\nUniversity Street.\r\n\r\nThe style of architecture is Scottish baronial, to which\r\nthe limestone of Montreal is well suited. The facade of the\r\nadministration block is after the style of F’yvie Castle,\r\nin Aberdeenshire. Over the main arch of the doorway are the\r\nmonograms of Lord Mount Stephen and Sir Donald Smith. On the\r\nwestern gable of the central block appear the coat of arms of\r\nLord Mount Stephen with his motto “Lippen,” an old Scotch word,\r\nmeaning to attend. Sir Donald’s coat of arms is on the eastern\r\ngable, and bears the motto “Perseverance.” Both of these mottoes\r\nare admirable motives to inspire service in the cause of the\r\nsick. The building, begun in 1891, has employed 600 workmen and\r\ncost nearly eight hundred thousand dollars. To construction,\r\nfurnishing and maintenance, the founders have devoted nearly\r\none million five hundred thousand dollars. Designed by H. Saxon\r\nSnell, an English architect of eminence, whose specialty is\r\nhospitals, the structure combines, with peculiarities of its own,\r\nthe best characteristics of Mr. Snell’s previous efforts.\r\n\r\nThe act of incorporation, passed in 1890, provides for fifteen\r\ngovernors, of whom seven shall be the mayor of Montreal,\r\npresident of the Board of Trade, president of the Canadian\r\nPacific Railway, president of the Bank of Montreal, the chief\r\nofficer of the Grand Trunk Railway resident at Montreal, and the\r\nprincipal and dean of the faculty of McGill College.\r\n\r\nThe other governors, expressly named in the act, were Sir Donald\r\nSmith (afterwards Lord Strathcona), Lord Mount Stephen, Alexander\r\nG. Patterson, W.J. Buchanan, Andrew Robertson and Thomas\r\nDavidson, Esquires.\r\n\r\nThe act provided for branch convalescent hospitals at Banff, N.W.\r\nTerritories, and at Caledonia Springs.\r\n\r\nAssociates are constituted by paying $1,000 and $20, or more\r\nannually, or $5,000 in all.\r\n\r\nIn an address read by R.B. Angus, chairman of the board, to\r\nHis Excellency, the Governor General was informed that he was\r\nex-officio a visitor of the institution, and would always be\r\nwelcome.\r\n\r\nReplying, His Excellency declared that, out of consideration for\r\nSir Donald Smith, whom he had with difficulty induced to attend,\r\nhe would substitute, for praise of the founders, congratulations\r\nof all concerned upon the happy conclusion of this magnificent\r\nact of practical philanthropy and of Christian benevolence.\r\n\r\nHe announced that R.B. Angus, Esq., successor of the late Sir\r\nJohn Abbott as chairman of the board, had promised $25,000\r\ntowards the support of the institution, and hoped that the\r\nexample would be followed in sums large and small.\r\n\r\nWishing the founders long life, to witness the happiness which\r\nthey have prepared, the Governor General called for and lead\r\nthree cheers for the founders and three for Her Majesty.\r\n\r\nThe Hospital consists of three really separate buildings,\r\nconnected together by stone bridges. Viewed from the front on\r\nPine Avenue, the hospital appears to form three sides of a\r\nsquare, but it is in reality H-shaped. The central part is the\r\nadministration block, while the two wings contain the wards and\r\naccessory rooms, the theatres and chemical laboratory, etc.\r\n\r\nRegardless of expense, the best surgical inventions and\r\nappliances have been collected from the chief seats of medical\r\nscience on two continents. Not only are the physicians, surgeons\r\nand nurses elegantly housed, but even the servants are to be\r\nenvied their comfortable quarters. A training school for nurses\r\nis attached to the hospital.\r\n\r\nA fine bust of Her Majesty, in prominent position, reminds\r\nvisitors that the inception of this admirable institution\r\ncelebrates, in the name, and with the approval, of Her Majesty,\r\nthe fiftieth anniversary of her coming to the throne.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    THE HOMŒOPATHIC HOSPITAL\r\n\r\nThe first records of Homœopathy in this city are contained in\r\na pamphlet by Dr. John Wanless, published in 1864, giving the\r\nsubstance of a series of letters which had appeared in attempted\r\nrefutation of Homœopathy, and the doctor’s replies thereto as\r\nthey were printed in the Montreal “Transcript” of the time.\r\n\r\nIn his pamphlet the author mentions Doctor Rosenstein as one\r\nof our first Homœopaths, and relates in detail the treatment\r\nwhich that practitioner received while trying to conduct an\r\nexperimental case in the Montreal General Hospital. Dr. Arthur\r\nFisher was a contemporary.\r\n\r\nOn the 28th of June, 1863, Messrs. Thomas McGinn, F.E. Grafton,\r\nJames Baylis, James A. Mathewson, James Muir, E.L. Ransom, D.A.\r\nAnsell, Fleck, and McCready, met in the Mechanics’ Hall and made\r\nthe first attempt to organize Homœopathy in Montreal.\r\n\r\nA dispensary was established, which from unexplained causes was\r\ndiscontinued after two years of apparent prosperity.\r\n\r\nNew names of adherents appear from time to time, among them\r\nHon. James Ferrier, G.A. Holland, Hon. L.S. Huntingdon, George\r\nWashington Stephens, James Stewart, John S. McLachlan, Charles\r\nAlexander, D. Drysdale, E. Lusher and Henry Lyman.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ROYAL VICTORIA HOSPITAL]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MONTREAL GENERAL HOSPITAL]\r\n\r\nOn March 18, 1865, Messrs. James A. Mathewson, James Baylis,\r\nGeorge A. Holland, James Muir, Thomas McGinn, John Wanless, M.D.,\r\nand Francis E. Grafton, obtained from the Legislative Council and\r\nAssembly of Canada a charter incorporating themselves and their\r\nsuccessors under the name and title of “The Montreal Homœopathic\r\nAssociation,” with power to establish in Montreal a Dispensary\r\nand a Hospital, to establish a College and appoint professors\r\nto teach the principles and practice of medicine according to\r\nthe doctrines of Homœopathy, and to grant licenses to practice\r\nmedicine according to these doctrines within the Province of\r\nLower Canada. This charter was further amended, and the powers\r\namplified by the Legislative Council and Assembly of Canada,\r\nSeptember 14, 1865, and the Quebec Legislature on March 30, 1883.\r\nOwing to a limited clientéle and paucity of resources, little was\r\ndone for many years beyond the _pro forma_ requirements of the\r\ncharter, and the very important powers granted thereunder lay\r\ndormant, though carefully nursed and guarded by the old stalwarts\r\nof those pioneer days. In 1893 the Association took a new lease\r\nof life, and from that day on the story of Homœopathy has been\r\none of brilliant achievement and ever-widening influence. The\r\nAssociation has recently established a public free dispensary\r\nat the corner of St. Antoine and Inspector streets, and its\r\nhoped-for career of usefulness will be watched with interest.\r\n\r\nIn March, 1893, a petition to the Governors of the newly\r\ninaugurated Royal Victoria Hospital, asking for a Homœopathic\r\nward, was circulated, and within two months thirteen feet of\r\nnames of prominent citizens favouring Homœopathy were obtained.\r\n\r\nOn May 18, 1893, a deputation consisting of Doctor Wanless,\r\nReverend Dr. Barbour, Reverend Dr. Ross, Dr. H.M. Patton, Messrs.\r\nSamuel Bell, James Baylis, John Torrance, James A. Gillespie,\r\nJames Ferrier, F.E. Grafton, Charles Alexander and E.G. O’Connor\r\nmet the Governors of the Royal Victoria Hospital in the board\r\nroom of the Bank of Montreal, and presented the petition. It\r\nwas courteously received, and compliance therewith promised,\r\nif possible. On January 5, 1894, a formal reply was received,\r\nstating that the petition could not be granted. On November 13,\r\n1893, a similar request to the Montreal General Hospital was also\r\nrefused.\r\n\r\nIn 1893 negotiations for special accommodation in existing\r\nhospitals having failed, and the demand for Homœopathic Hospital\r\nfacilities having become urgent, the board decided to take\r\nthe important step permitted in its charter, and to acquire a\r\nhospital under its own control.\r\n\r\nThe property, No. 44 McGill College Avenue, consisting of a\r\nfour-story brick building and 3,300 square feet of land, was\r\npurchased for $8,000, and in July, 1894, the deeds were signed\r\nfor the Association by Mr. Charles Alexander, president, and Dr.\r\nH.M. Patton, the secretary. During the summer of 1894 the repairs\r\ncommittee, with energy and excellent taste, transformed the old\r\nresidence into one of the most attractive and complete of small\r\nhospitals.\r\n\r\nOn October 2, 1894, the Hospital was formally opened, the Lord\r\nBishop of Montreal and other representative clergymen conducting\r\nan imposing inaugural ceremony in the presence of a large number\r\nof prominent citizens; thus was launched into benevolent\r\nactivity the first Homœopathic Hospital in the Province of\r\nQuebec, under the following management:\r\n\r\nThe first hospital officials, 1894, were: President, Samuel Bell;\r\nvice president, Mr. Charles Morton; treasurer, Joseph Gould;\r\nsecretary, Dr. W.G. Nichol.\r\n\r\nThe committee of management was composed of Lady Van Horne, Mrs.\r\nHector Mackenzie, Mrs. W.B. Lindsay, Mrs. Henry Thomas, Mrs. T.\r\n(Dr.) Nichol, Mrs. Roswell Fisher, Miss Ames, Dr. John Wanless,\r\nDr. H.M. Patton, James Baylis; Miss M.E. Baylis, secretary of\r\ncommittee.\r\n\r\nThe medical superintendent was Dr. H.M. Patton and the lady\r\nsuperintendent, Miss Thompson.\r\n\r\nThe consulting staff consisted of Dr. Arthur Fisher, Dr. George\r\nLogan, Doctor McLaren, and Dr. George Gale, while the attending\r\nphysicians were Doctors Wanless, W.G. Nichol, Griffith, and T.\r\nScott Nichol.\r\n\r\nThe attending surgeon was Dr. H.M. Patton.\r\n\r\nThe first year’s work showed 158 patients occupying its beds, 135\r\nof whom were public, and twenty-three private patients. The death\r\nrate for the year is given as 2.5.\r\n\r\nA new wing was soon required, while the maternity annex and\r\nnurses’ home was next added by the Woman’s Auxiliary.\r\n\r\nOnce more the devoted ladies of the Woman’s Auxiliary nobly\r\nresponded to the growing demands of pressing hospital needs,\r\nwhich included provision for laundry work under their own\r\nsupervision, better accommodation for their admirable little band\r\nof pupil nurses, and the inauguration of a much-needed maternity\r\nfor ladies desiring private hospital accommodation. The adjoining\r\nhouse, No. 46 McGill College Avenue, was leased from Mr. W.L.\r\nMaltby on a long term, Miss Annie Moodie becoming personally\r\nresponsible for the rent. The basement was fitted up as a\r\nlaundry. The first floor given over to the nurses as a dormitory,\r\nwith sitting-room and locker accommodation. The bath-room was\r\nremodelled and refitted, and four dainty, private wards equipped\r\nand furnished for maternity patients. The whole Annex was handed\r\nover complete to the Hospital management, practically free of\r\ndebt, on August 6, 1899.\r\n\r\nThe year 1900 is noteworthy from the fact of the Woman’s\r\nAuxiliary relinquishing all share and responsibility for Hospital\r\n_management_, which hitherto had been jointly controlled by the\r\ncommittee and the auxiliary. The Committee of Management was\r\nrecast and consolidated, and large responsibility put upon the\r\nchairman, Mr. S.M. Baylis being the incumbent of the office at\r\nthat time.\r\n\r\nIn 1904, after careful deliberation, the Homœopathic Association,\r\nunder whose charter of 1865 and amending acts the Hospital\r\nhad been instituted and maintained, formally authorized the\r\napplication for a special charter, and agreed to transfer all\r\nreal property, equipment, securities and effects hitherto held\r\nunder its title, and acquired for the use and benefit of the\r\nHospital, to the new corporation, on consideration of the latter\r\nassuming all annuity and other obligations attaching thereto. In\r\nMay, 1904, the Quebec Legislature passed an act incorporating\r\n“The Homœopathic Hospital of Montreal,” the following gentlemen\r\nand their successors being constituted a body politic under that\r\nname and title: James A. Mathewson, Francis E. Grafton, Charles\r\nAlexander, Samuel Bell, John T. Hagar, Louis Barbeau, Roswell\r\nC. Fisher, Edward G. O’Connor, Samuel M. Baylis, Thomas J.\r\nDawson, Edward M. Morgan, M.D., Hugh M. Patton, M.D., Arthur D.\r\nPatton, M.D., Alexander R. Griffith, M.D., Arthur Fisher, M.D.,\r\nJohn W. Hughes and George Durnford.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: INSANE ASYLUM AT LONGUE POINT]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HOMEOPATHIC HOSPITAL]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WESTERN HOSPITAL]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PROTESTANT INSANE ASYLUM AT VERDUN]\r\n\r\nThe Jubilee Endowment was inaugurated in 1897, in commemoration\r\nof the jubilee of beloved Queen Victoria, by the donation of\r\n$10,000 by the late Alexander Clerk, and since augmented by\r\nbequests from the late James Baylis, and other sources, to the\r\ncapital sum of $10,871.61.\r\n\r\nThe Phillips’ Training School for Nurses was founded\r\ncontemporaneously with the establishment of the Hospital, and\r\nso named in honour of the first benefactress, Mrs. Georgina D.\r\nPhillips; the school has done good work in training and launching\r\nin professional careers so many graduates.\r\n\r\nThe College of Homœopathic Physicians and Surgeons of Montreal is\r\noperated under the charter granted to the Homœopathic Association\r\nin the Act of 1865, and amending acts. Since the relinquishment\r\nto the new incorporation of its hospital work, the College is\r\nnow the main care of the Association. Applicants for its valued\r\nlicense must be graduates of an approved Medical College, and\r\nmust pass the critical examination of its licensing board in the\r\nspecial field of Homœopathic therapeutics.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    HOSPITALS FOR THE INSANE\r\n\r\n                 St. Jean de Dieu, Longue Pointe\r\n\r\nThe care of the insane was first entrusted as a special\r\ndepartment in this city to the Grey Nuns in 1793. The work was\r\nrelinquished by them in 1844.\r\n\r\nThe modern work is now undertaken for the Montreal district and\r\nthe Province of Quebec by the Sisters of Providence at Longue\r\nPointe and the Protestant Insane Asylum at Verdun. The history of\r\neach is interesting.\r\n\r\nThe care of the insane was undertaken by the Providence Nuns\r\non the proposition of the Quebec government to them in 1873.\r\nIn 1889, Mother Theresa of Jesus visited the principal insane\r\nasylums of Europe and America. She declared that the method of\r\ndividing the asylum into annexed pavilions should be adopted\r\nin the classification of various cerebral diseases, which was\r\naccordingly done. At present, two rows of pavilions cover five\r\nacres of land. Nine acres will be required to complete the Asylum\r\nand the other detached dwellings which have been erected on\r\nthe 500-acre farm. On the first storey is an electric tramway\r\nwhich operates over its 3,000-foot corridor, and is for the use\r\nof the personnel of the Asylum. A railroad, 15,000 feet long,\r\nowned by the Community, is used for transportation of goods,\r\ncoal, wood, lumber, etc., from the quays on the St. Lawrence to\r\nthe main building. The institution was visited by a disastrous\r\nfire in 1890. Nevertheless, the Asylum prospered, and today it\r\ncompares favorably with similar asylums, either in America or\r\nEurope. Twelve thousand seven hundred and eighty patients have\r\nbeen admitted from the day it was formally opened. The medical\r\nstaff is composed of three house and three visiting physicians,\r\nthree inspectors, appointed by the Government, and a medical\r\nsuperintendent.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             VERDUN\r\n\r\nThe movement for a separate Protestant Insane Asylum originated\r\nwith Mr. Alfred Perry in 1880, who called a public meeting for\r\nthe purpose of promoting it. It was not upheld that year but,\r\nhaving called a second meeting on February 21, 1881, a resolution\r\nproposed by Mr. Henry Lyman and seconded by the Reverend Dr.\r\nSullivan was carried unanimously after considerable discussion:\r\n“That it is expedient and extremely requisite that steps should\r\nnow be taken looking to the establishment of a Protestant Insane\r\nAsylum in the Province of Quebec.”\r\n\r\nOn June 30, 1881, there was passed a bill entitled “An Act to\r\nIncorporate the Protestant Hospital for the Insane.” Mr. Morrice\r\ngenerously defrayed all expenses connected with the securing of\r\nthis charter.\r\n\r\nThe Rt. Rev. William B. Bond, LL. D., Lord Bishop of the Diocese\r\nof Montreal; John Jenkins, D.D., LL. D.; Gavin Lang; George\r\nDouglas, LL. D.; George H. Wells; Henry Wilkes, D.D.; A.H. Munro;\r\nW.S. Barnes; William A. Hall, M.D.; Sir Hugh Allan; Andrew Allan;\r\nGeorge Macrae, Q.C.; Charles Alexander; Henry Lyman; M.H. Gault,\r\nM.P.; Thomas White, M.P.; Peter Redpath; Adam Darling; Hugh\r\nMcLellan; James Coristine; S.H. May; T. James Claxton; James\r\nJohnston; Alex McGibbon; Alfred Perry; Leo H. Davidson, and such\r\nother persons, donors or subscribers, as might be or become\r\nassociated with them and their successors, by this act were\r\nconstituted a body corporate to found a Protestant institution\r\nfor the care, maintenance and cure of the insane of the several\r\nProtestant denominations in the Province of Quebec.\r\n\r\nIn accordance with the provision of the act, and pursuant to\r\na notice published in the “Herald” and “Gazette,” as required\r\nby law, a meeting of those interested was held in the Y.M.C.A.\r\nrooms, on December 20, 1881, Mr. Morrice presiding. At the\r\nrequest of the chairman, Doctor Davidson explained the act\r\nof incorporation, and advised that a board of twenty-four\r\ngovernors should be elected by subscribers of $10 each, who thus\r\nconstituted themselves members of the corporation, this step\r\nbeing necessary to preserve the charter. The majority of those\r\npresent having paid the required sum, a vote was taken by ballot,\r\nand the following gentlemen elected to the Board of Governors:\r\nMr. D. Morrice; Mr. M.H. Gault, M.P.; Rev. Gavin Lang; Dr. F.W.\r\nCampbell; Dr. J.C. Cameron; Mr. Charles Alexander; Mr. Henry\r\nLyman; Reverend Dr. Sullivan; Dr. William Osler; Mr. Alfred\r\nPerry; Mr. L.H. Davidson; Rev. William Hall; Mr. T.J. Claxton;\r\nMr. Thomas White, M.P.; Rev. A.B. Mackay; His Lordship Bishop\r\nBond; Rev. G.H. Wells; Mr. Warden King; Canon Baldwin; Mr. George\r\nMacrae, Q. C; Mr. Peter Redpath; Mr. Adam Darling; Mr. Hugh\r\nMcLennan; and Mr. A.A. Ayer.\r\n\r\nIt was not till 1887 that a site was determined upon for the\r\nprojected asylum. Subscriptions, however, had been obtained which\r\namounted at the end of 1887 to a total of $68,139.82, which\r\nincludes a gift from the Provincial Government of $7,812.29.\r\n\r\nAt a meeting of governors held April 14, 1887, it was finally\r\nresolved to purchase a portion of the Hadley farm, which had been\r\nselected by the site committee in the spring of 1886, for the\r\nsum of $18,000. Situated in the Municipality of Verdun (whence\r\nthe name Verdun Hospital by which the institution is often\r\ndesignated) just at the foot of the Lachine Rapids, the location\r\nchosen was an admirable and extremely picturesque one. The\r\nmountain rising behind crowned with green woods, its lower slopes\r\ndotted with villas, the mighty St. Lawrence, with its timbered\r\nislands, stretching in front; and the dancing rapids, with their\r\nmusical roar, in such close proximity, made a prospect of scenic\r\nbeauty difficult to surpass.\r\n\r\nBy the spring of 1890, the administration building and west\r\nwing were completed, the first patient being received on July\r\n15, 1890, and before the end of the year there had been 139\r\nadmissions. The first medical superintendent was Dr. T.J.W.\r\nBurgess, who has held the post ever since.\r\n\r\nA new wing was added in 1894. On January 24, 1895, the\r\ninstitution was honoured by a visit from their Excellencies, the\r\nGovernor General Lord Aberdeen and the Countess of Aberdeen.\r\n\r\nBy 1896 the “Annex” for imbecile and violent patients was begun\r\nin the spring and completed in the autumn. The summer of 1897\r\nsaw its opening and the erection of an infirmary. On September\r\n11th, the asylum was visited by the psychological section of the\r\nBritish Medical Association that gathered in Montreal on the\r\noccasion of the first meeting of the society outside the British\r\nIsles.\r\n\r\nIn 1898 the pathological laboratory, donated by Mr. G.B. Burland,\r\nwas installed under the direction of Dr. Andrew McPhail. The\r\n“East” house in contradistinction to the Annex or “West” house\r\nwas completed and opened. This summer the asylum was visited by\r\nthe Medico-Psychological Association, the oldest of American\r\nMedical societies then holding its fifty-eighth annual meeting in\r\nMontreal.\r\n\r\nIn 1907 the Hadley farm of sixty acres adjoining the hospital\r\nwas purchased and donated at the cost of $42,000 by a Canadian\r\ngentleman, Dr. James Douglas, of New York. In the same year the\r\naddition of a power house and other lighting and water supply\r\nimprovements cost the establishment about one hundred and\r\ntwenty-five thousand dollars.\r\n\r\nIn 1909 a new annex, known as the North West House, was opened\r\non September 16th. The capacity of the buildings in 1910 was\r\nfor a population of 680. The institution at the end of its\r\ntwenty-first year had 366 cases, of which nearly forty per cent\r\nhave been discharged as cured. The asylum which has acted for the\r\nProtestants of the Province has certainly a good record to show.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       THE CIVIC HOSPITALS\r\n\r\nAfter the great epidemic of smallpox in 1885, when the sick were\r\nisolated or treated in temporary buildings, erected on the old\r\nexhibition grounds, the City Council on January 13, 1886, named a\r\ncommission to choose a site for the erection of a civic smallpox\r\nhospital. In consequence of which, on May 25, 1886, the city\r\nbought the Robert property situated in the Hochelaga Ward, north\r\nof Moreau Street. This hospital was demolished and reconstructed\r\nin 1912. It is administered by the hygiene department of the City\r\nHall for smallpox cases.\r\n\r\nThe steps leading to their erection follow:\r\n\r\nUntil 1904 there had been only the Civic Hospital on Moreau\r\nStreet for contagious diseases--a totally inadequate provision in\r\na large city. In 1901, on January 23d, the city council received\r\nan offer by Sister Filiatrault, superior general of the Grey\r\nNuns, offering to contribute $50,000 for a contagious disease\r\nhospital for Catholics on the condition that the city should\r\ncontribute a like amount with an annual subvertion of $10,000. A\r\nweek later the Montreal General Hospital and the Royal Victoria\r\nHospital made a similar offer for the general population.\r\n\r\nThis being accepted, the Catholic hospital, St. Paul’s, at 656\r\nMaisonneuve Street, was in operation by 1904 under the direction\r\nof the Notre Dame Hospital, but the Alexandra Hospital, owing\r\nto several hitches, was not opened till July 9, 1906, its\r\nincorporation being granted in 1903 to James Crathern, Richard B.\r\nAngus and Charles F. Smith.\r\n\r\nThe hospital is erected at the foot of Charron Street and the\r\nriver bounds it on the south and east.\r\n\r\nIn 1906 Sir William Macdonald purchased and presented to the\r\nhospital the triangular piece of land between it and the river\r\nto the east, at a cost of $7,141.35. In 1908 the late Sir R.G.\r\nReid built and equipped a very necessary observatory pavilion\r\nat the cost of $12,568.82. A nurses’ home is at present being\r\nerected to the west of the administration building, of fireproof\r\nconstruction, at a cost of about $56,000, including equipment,\r\nwhich will bring the total expense of the hospital building up to\r\n$360,000. The patients admitted from January 1, 1913, to December\r\n31, 1913, numbered 1,036.\r\n\r\nThe Hôpital St. Paul, a section of Notre Dame Hospital, receives\r\nCatholic and the Alexandra Hospital, Protestant patients. The\r\ncity pays each one of these institutions annually $35,000 for\r\nthirty-five beds a day, and $1.00 a day in addition for each\r\npatient above the contracted number.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    TUBERCULOSIS DISPENSARIES\r\n\r\n                   The Royal Edward Institute\r\n\r\nIn this city it is not quite twelve years ago since the first\r\norganized effort against the ravages of the “white plague”\r\nwas initiated by the formation of the Montreal League for the\r\nPrevention of Tuberculosis. At a meeting held in the Art Gallery\r\non November 29th, 1902, under the auspices of the Governor\r\nGeneral, Lord Minto, resolutions were passed calling for combined\r\neffort on the part of the government, the city authorities, and\r\npublic-spirited citizens to relieve the miseries associated with\r\nthis infection and to check its spread. A committee was appointed\r\nat that time, but not until June, 1903, was work actually\r\ncommenced in a small room in Bleury Street.\r\n\r\nThe establishment of a sanatorium in the near neighbourhood\r\nfor the treatment of incipient cases, and of a hospital for\r\nthe treatment of the more advanced and hopeless cases, was at\r\nfirst proposed; but after consideration it was felt that the\r\nexpense of maintaining institutions sufficiently large to cope\r\nwith the requirements of the city would involve an expense\r\nfar beyond what the community could be reasonably expected at\r\nthat time to contribute, so a beginning of work was made by\r\nthe establishment of a dispensary, November 1, 1904, and the\r\nemployment of what has been termed the dispensary method for\r\nreaching the tuberculous poor. It is a method which has been\r\ngradually developed in Edinburgh under the guidance of Dr. R.W.\r\nPhillip, and in France by Calmette, and which has been adopted\r\nwith much success in Philadelphia. The method emphasizes the\r\nimportance of disseminating a practical knowledge regarding the\r\nspread, development, and course of the disease among the poor,\r\nand is based upon two facts; first, that it is not necessary for\r\npatients in the early stages of tuberculosis to leave their\r\nhomes to be healed, and, second, that patients can be educated\r\nso to comport themselves as to be of little danger to those\r\naround them. Montreal is one of the first pioneers in purely\r\ntuberculosis clinical institutions, the first established by\r\nDoctor Phillip in Edinburgh in 1887, being followed in 1903 by\r\nCalmette in Lille, and by New York and Montreal in 1904. Making\r\nuse of this plan it has been the aim of the executive board\r\nnot only to attend to the wants of such cases as may apply to\r\nthe dispensary, but to co-operate with the medical profession\r\nthroughout the city, both in hospital and private practice. All\r\nphysicians are invited to report to a central station cases of\r\ntuberculosis occurring in their practice which cannot be fully\r\ntreated by them. These cases are tabulated and arranged according\r\nto the district in which they live; each patient is visited\r\nat his home by an inspector or nurse; full instructions, both\r\nwritten and verbal, are given regarding the mode of life to be\r\nfollowed to secure the greatest advantage to the patient and the\r\ngreatest security to those around him.\r\n\r\nAn interesting exhibition dealing with all phases of the crusade\r\nwas organized in October, 1908, and was visited by over 50,000\r\npersons, including the older children attending the public\r\nschools. Addresses were given by eminent speakers and an attempt\r\nwas made to reach all clasess of our citizens and interest them\r\nin the measures necessary to ensure health, and check the spread\r\nof this infection. This movement in public education has led the\r\nway to subsequent health exhibitions in the city, notably the\r\nChild Welfare Exhibition of 1912.\r\n\r\nLater an appeal was made to the Lieutenant-Governor-in-Council to\r\nappoint a Royal Commission to inquire into the conditions in this\r\nprovince favouring the spread of tuberculosis and to ascertain\r\nthe best methods of checking it.\r\n\r\nWith the growing work of the League, the urgent need of more\r\nroom to meet the necessities of its dispensary work, and the\r\ndesirability of a large central station, where a resident staff\r\nof nurses could be continually in attendance, was forced upon\r\nthe executive. At this juncture, a philanthropic citizen, the\r\nlate Lieut.-Col. Jeffrey H. Burland, came forward with his very\r\ngenerous offer of $50,000 from his sisters and himself as a\r\ncontribution in memory of their father and mother, to be applied\r\ntowards the purchase and equipment of a suitable building, on\r\nthe condition that the general public would contribute an equal\r\namount to serve as an endowment sufficient to cover the annual\r\nexpenses connected with the maintenance of its efficiency. This\r\ncondition has unfortunately not yet been fulfilled; as only\r\n$36,000 has been subscribed, nevertheless, Colonel Burland\r\nimpressed with the urgency of the League’s need acquired in May,\r\n1909, the very central and commodious detached building, No. 47\r\nBelmont Park. This with much judgment and care he had altered\r\nand enlarged to suit the possible requirements of the dispensary\r\nwork for many years to come, and to serve as the headquarters of\r\nthe League’s work in Montreal. No dispensary building like this\r\none with its bright sun parlours and large roof garden exists\r\nanywhere; and it is hoped that its advantages may not only prove\r\nto have much practical benefit for the consumptive patient, but\r\nalso have an educational value for the general public.\r\n\r\nThe whole equipment has been very carefully studied and all\r\nthe arrangements made with the view of securing the greatest\r\nefficiency at the minimum of running expense.\r\n\r\nBy gracious permission of King Edward VII the organization became\r\nknown as the Royal Edward Institute.\r\n\r\nIts work is one that Montreal has become proud of.\r\n\r\n\r\n                     THE BRUCHESI INSTITUTE\r\n\r\nThe Bruchesi Institute is the tuberculosis hospital and\r\ndispensary under French-speaking direction for patients of all\r\nraces and religions. It started humbly when at the request of Dr.\r\nEugène Grenier, granted on October 10th, 1910, the Sisters of\r\nProvidence Asylum, 369 St. Catherine Street, put aside a couple\r\nof rooms for an anti-tuberculosis clinic. Dr. P.E. Bousquet\r\nundertook the treatment of the superior respiratory tract, Dr.\r\nB.E. Bourgeois that of surgical tuberculosis, and Doctor Grenier,\r\nassisted by Drs. J.A. Jarry and Louis Verchelden, that of\r\npulmonary tuberculosis.\r\n\r\nThe first board of administration was completed on March 9, 1911,\r\nas follows: honorary president, the Rt. Rev. Paul Bruchesi,\r\nArchbishop of Montreal; president, J. Auguste Richard; vice\r\npresident, Abbé Tranchemontagne; treasurer, U.H. Dandurand;\r\nsecretary, Dr. Eugène Grenier; directors, Canon Adam, T. Bastien\r\nand Dr. E. Dubé, who greatly promoted its formation. The same\r\nnames appear in the act of incorporation of the Bruchesi\r\nInstitute, November 10, 1911. A medical board was also formed\r\nat the period, Dr. E. Dubé being elected president, Dr. Eugène\r\nGrenier, secretary, the latter being succeeded by Dr. Gustave\r\nArchambault.\r\n\r\nThe dispensary opened on February 27, 1911. On July 24, 1912,\r\nthis was moved to 340 St. Hubert Street, where the Sisters\r\nof Providence placed at its disposition many large rooms. In\r\nthese new quarters the institute has eleven beds for private\r\ntuberculosis persons; 316 have been received and treated in these\r\nprivate rooms from August 18, 1912, to October 31, 1914.\r\n\r\nEducational courses for public instruction through lectures and\r\na press campaign, and a post-graduate course for physicians\r\nwere in operation by July 15, 1913, the opening lectures of the\r\npost-graduate course of 1914 being given by Prof. S.A. Knopp, of\r\nNew York. Thirteen physicians have already followed these special\r\ncourses on “early diagnosis and treatment of tuberculosis.”\r\n\r\nWith the aid of the Sisters of Providence the Bruchesi Institute\r\nopened in 1911 a preventorium at Beloeil, but the lack of\r\nfinancial support on the part of Montreal and the province caused\r\nthe institute to discontinue this branch of its work, after\r\none year. The Bruchesi Institute receives from the Sisters of\r\nProvidence the use of the building it occupies, including heating\r\nand cleaning, the services of six sister-nurses, etc. It also\r\nreceives the services of thirty-two attending physicians, from\r\nthe City of Montreal $3,000, and from the Province of Quebec\r\n$3,000, and material financial aid from the public. The institute\r\nis affiliated to “The Canadian Association for the Prevention of\r\nTuberculosis.”\r\n\r\n\r\n                       THE GRACE DART HOME\r\n\r\nA supplementary aid for tuberculosis patients is supplied by\r\nthe Grace Dart Home, which was started about eight years ago\r\nas a private institution by Mr. Henry J. Dart in memory of his\r\ndaughter, Grace Dart. Friends became interested and a provincial\r\ncharter of incorporation was obtained. About two years ago the\r\nformer house of Sir Francis Hincks on St. Antoine Street was\r\npurchased and extensions made so that between thirty and forty\r\npatients are provided for.\r\n\r\n\r\n       CIVIC ASSISTANCE TO THE ANTI-TUBERCULOSIS MOVEMENT\r\n\r\nThe city has come to the relief of the tuberculosis movement. Its\r\nassistance of recent years is as follows:\r\n\r\nAmount paid for the maintenance of tuberculous patients in 1913,\r\n$6,276.45. In 1912 the amount was $6,147.55.\r\n\r\nThe amount voted in 1913 for the treatment of cases of\r\ntuberculosis amounted to $14,300.00, and the same was apportioned\r\nas follows:\r\n\r\nHospital for incurables, $7,500.00; Royal Edward Institute,\r\n$3,300.00; Grace Dart Home, $500.00; Bruchesi Institute,\r\n$3,000.00. In 1912 it was $13,300.00 and in 1911, $11,300.00.\r\n\r\nSupplementing the hospitals are the dispensaries connected\r\nwith the convents and the milk stations. One of the oldest now\r\nexisting is the Montreal Dispensary, established in 1853, the\r\nDispensaire of the Sisters of Providence being opened on June 1,\r\n1863.\r\n\r\n\r\n                THE CHILDREN’S MEMORIAL HOSPITAL\r\n\r\nOf recent years the special hospital treatment of children has\r\nbeen marked. The greatest development in infant care is to\r\nbe dated to the rise of the Children’s Memorial Hospital on\r\nPine Avenue. Not only is this institution to be credited with\r\nefficiency in its general treatment of infants, but it especially\r\ndeserves the credit of being the pioneer in Canada of special\r\nclinical treatment and the special vocational education for\r\ncrippled and deformed children in the school latterly erected\r\non its grounds and completed in September, 1914. This will be\r\ntreated later.\r\n\r\nThe first meeting of the committee for the founding of the\r\nChildren’s Memorial Hospital, of Montreal, was held on November\r\n25, 1902. Nearly a year went by, however, before the committee\r\ndeemed it advisable, or even practical, to make tangible\r\nadvancement in this great undertaking.\r\n\r\nNovember, 1903, marks a memorable epoch in the history of the\r\nchild cripples throughout Canada, for it was then--nearly a year\r\nafter their first meeting--that the committee procured temporary\r\nquarters in the private dwelling, 500 Guy Street, where they\r\npractically launched their noble enterprise, thus bringing\r\ninto being one of Canada’s greatest and long-felt needs, an\r\ninstitution especially adapted for the treatment of deformities\r\nof children and of the many diseases accruing from these\r\ndeformities.\r\n\r\nTo those temporary quarters children were brought from the East\r\nand West, from the North and South of the Dominion to receive\r\nsurgical and medical treatment. In that small building, though\r\nthe accommodations were woefully limited, many and remarkable\r\ncures have been effected.\r\n\r\nThe Children’s Memorial Hospital of today was opened April 6,\r\n1909, its beautiful location and handsome and well equipped\r\nbuildings making it a credit to the city and to the Dominion.\r\n\r\nFrom an institution, pitifully hampered at its beginning and\r\nduring the first five years of its existence, has evolved one\r\nresplendent in its environments of sunshine and mountain air;\r\nof foliage, flowers and birds. It occupies one of the most\r\ndelightful sites in or around the beautiful city of Montreal.\r\nSituated on the upper slope of Cedar Avenue with the greater\r\nheight of Mount Royal for its background, the blue waters of the\r\ngrand St. Lawrence stretching before it, the busy city almost\r\nencircling it, the Children’s Memorial Hospital of Montreal\r\nstands, not merely an ornament to our city, but a benefit to\r\nor land. Its wards, sun-parlors, operating rooms, out-door\r\ndepartment, nurses’ apartments, dining room, kitchens, corridors,\r\npassages--all bear evidence of the great work carried on in the\r\ninstitution.\r\n\r\nIt is a general hospital for all children’s diseases, with the\r\nexception of those that are contagious, with wards for boys,\r\ngirls and infants, and there is surgical and medical treatment.\r\nThe officers from the inception have been: Sir Melbourne Tait,\r\npresident; Sir H. Graham, first vice president; Mr. G.H.\r\nSmithers, second vice president and honorary treasurer; Dr. A.\r\nMcKenzie Forbes, third vice president and honorary secretary; Dr.\r\nH.B. Cushing, fourth vice president and recording secretary; and\r\nMr. George J. Foster, honorary solicitor.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    THE HOPITAL STE. JUSTINE\r\n\r\nThe Hôpital Ste. Justine, which is a corresponding institution\r\nto the last named, was established as a hospital and dispensary\r\nfor children in November, 1907, at No. 740 St. Denis Street, in\r\na house loaned at a nominal price by Mr. Damien Rolland. The\r\nnext spring it was removed to 820 Delorimier Avenue. Meantime,\r\nas the work was of great importance, steps were taken to rear a\r\nworthy building which saw its first stone solemnly blessed on\r\nSt. Denis Street in April, 1914. The building was opened in May,\r\n1914, and towards the end of June the patients were transferred\r\nfrom Delorimier Avenue. The formal blessing of the Hospital by\r\nArchbishop Bruchesi took place in November.\r\n\r\nThe hospital is well equipped with departments for general\r\nmedicine, surgery, diseases of the eye and skin diseases. For\r\nthe last three years the religious sisters, “Les Filles de\r\nla Sagesse,” have directed the internal arrangements and the\r\nnursing department. In connection with the hospital there is a\r\nschool of nurses for children’s diseases and the hospital is the\r\nonly body in the Dominion empowered to grant diplomas for such.\r\nArrangements are being made to connect the hospital with the\r\nUniversity of Laval as the children’s clinic.\r\n\r\nThe board of directors is composed of a committee of ladies and\r\nmedical men, the names of those applying for the charter being:\r\nMesdames Raoul Dandurand, Lady Lacoste, J.R. Thibaudeau, F.L.\r\nBeique, A.A. Thibaudeau, F. D. Monk, D. Rolland, L. Beaubien,\r\nF.X. Choquet, Jules Hamel, A. Berthiaume, F. Bruneau, J.A.\r\nLeblanc, Gérin Normand, R. Masson, Henri Gerin-Lajoie, L. de G.\r\nBeaubien, Mademoiselles Euphrosine Rolland, May Boyer, Blanche\r\nLareau and Thais Lacoste, and the following doctors: Joseph G.\r\nDubé, Zephyrin Lachapelle, R.G. Hervieux, Louis Joseph Gatelien\r\nCleroux, Telesphore Parizeau, Seraphin Boucher, Joseph Charles\r\nBourgoin, Benjamin Georges Bourgeois, Zephir Rheaume, Irma\r\nLevasseur, Edouard Etienne Laurent and Raoul Masson.\r\n\r\n\r\n               OTHER HOSPITAL ADJUNCT ASSOCIATIONS\r\n\r\nAmong the other supplemental hospitals in the city are: The\r\nSamaritan Hospital for Women, the Montreal Foundling and Baby\r\nHospital, the foundling department of the Grey Nuns, the Montreal\r\nMaternity Hospital, the Hôpital de la Miséricorde, the Women’s\r\nHospital, the St. Margaret’s Home, the various dispensaries, the\r\nAssociation for Affording First Aid, the Pure Milk Depots or\r\n_gouttes de lait_, the Créches, etc.\r\n\r\nNursing work in the homes of the people is carried on mostly by\r\nthe Victorian order of Nurses and the Soeurs de l’Esperance.\r\n\r\nSeveral of these will be treated in the section on General\r\nHumanitarian work, or in other places.\r\n\r\n\r\n                     THE MONTREAL DISPENSARY\r\n\r\nThe Montreal Dispensary deserves special notice as it dates its\r\nfoundation to 1853. Its work has been progressively useful.\r\n\r\nDuring the past twelve months the total number of applications\r\nfor advice and treatment made to the medical staff of the\r\ndispensary by the sick poor of the city was 23,240.\r\n\r\nThese were classified as to their religions as follows: Roman\r\nCatholics, 10,808; Protestants, 10,329; other creeds (mostly\r\nJews), 2,103.\r\n\r\nThis total may be again subdivided under the different\r\ndepartments in which these patients were treated, viz.: General\r\ndepartment (medical), 7,250; general department (surgical),\r\n1,170; department for diseases of eye, 1,768; department for\r\ndiseases of women, 1,404; department for diseases of ear, nose\r\nand throat, 1,521; department for diseases of the skin, 1,989;\r\ndepartment for diseases of children, 7,334; department for\r\ndiseases of tuberculosis, 804.\r\n\r\nA careful consideration of the above figures will impress one\r\nwith the fact that an institution which supplies free advice and\r\ntreatment to such numbers of poor people must of necessity be\r\ndoing a good work.\r\n\r\n\r\n                 THE MONTREAL MATERNITY HOSPITAL\r\n\r\nThe Montreal Maternity Hospital was established in 1843, with\r\nforty-three patients, the first physician being Dr. Michael\r\nMcCulloch and its first directress Mrs. W. Lunn. It was\r\nincorporated in 1853. In 1913 its patients numbered 1,293. The\r\nhospital provides a training school in obstetrics for McGill\r\nUniversity medical course and for nurses for the English\r\nhospitals. Among the directresses succeeding have been: 1844-55,\r\nMrs. W. Lunn; 1855-66, Mrs. D. Ross; 1866-75, Mrs. J. Molson;\r\n1875-82, Mrs. R. MacDonnell; 1882-85, Mrs. McCulloch; 1885-87,\r\nMrs. W. Gardner; 1887-88, Mrs. MacDonnell; 1888-89-91-93,\r\nMrs. W. Gardner; 1893-95, Mrs. W.R. Miller; 1895-96, Mrs.\r\nLabatt; 1896-97, Mrs. R. MacDonnell; 1897-98, Mrs. W.R. Miller;\r\n1908-1913, Mrs. R.W. Reford; 1914, Mrs. J.L. Cains.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           INCURABLES\r\n\r\nThere is also a Home for Incurables at Notre Dame de Gràce. In\r\n1898 several young ladies of the city inaugurated the work. Their\r\nefforts elicited universal admiration, receiving especially the\r\nassistance of Archbishop Bruchesi. In 1904 the former Monastery\r\nof the Precious Blood was fitted up in the Hospital by its\r\nnew possessors, the Sisters of Providence. From the date of\r\nestablishment over two thousand persons have been cared for.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       ST. MARGARET’S HOME\r\n\r\nAnother subsidiary hospital adjunct is the St. Margaret’s\r\nHome for Incurables, under an Anglican sisterhood, which\r\nwas incorporated in 1890, although its foundation occurred\r\nseveral years previous to that date. The head home is at\r\nGrinstead, England, and its American headquarters are at\r\nBoston, Massachusetts. The work of the home was originally of\r\na charitable nature and it has continued such in part to the\r\npresent time, caring for about twelve free patients continuously.\r\nHowever, it has taken on more of the nature of an hospital\r\nfor chronic incurables, and as such deserves mention in this\r\ndepartment.\r\n\r\nThe pressing need for a convalescent home for Montrealers has\r\nbeen met to some extent for about forty years by the Convalescent\r\nHome at Murray Bay, situated at the Lower St. Lawrence. It\r\nmay, however, be ranked as a city charity for it is directed\r\nand supported by Montrealers, its present president being\r\nMr. Sergeant P. Stearns, and the admission of patients being\r\nregulated by the Charity Organization Society of Montreal. Last\r\nyear, 1913, the home received 121 cases, 13 from Quebec, 2 from\r\nMurray Bay and the remainder from Montreal.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       CONVALESCENT HOMES\r\n\r\nThe latest addition to the hospital service of the city is the\r\ncare of convalescents overflowing from the busy hospital wards.\r\nThis has been found an important need and has only been met\r\nspasmodically till the present year, when the Loyola Convalescent\r\nHome to receive patients of all denominations was formally opened\r\non April 25th, at 26 Overdale Avenue, under the auspices of the\r\n“Ladies of Loyola Club.”\r\n\r\n\r\n                              NOTE\r\n\r\n                         MEDICAL BODIES\r\n\r\n             THE MONTREAL MEDICO-CHIRURGICAL SOCIETY\r\n\r\nOn Saturday, September 23, 1843, nineteen medical men met at the\r\nhouse of Dr. James Crawford, on Little St. James Street, and\r\nresolved to found a society “for the purpose of communicating\r\ntogether on subjects connected with their profession.” The\r\nfounders were:\r\n\r\nA.F. Holmes, O.F. Bruneau, J.B.C. Trestler, Archibald Hall, Henry\r\nMount, William McNider, J.G. Bibaud, James Crawford, George W.\r\nCampbell, C.S. Sewell, William Sutherland, Francis Badgley,\r\nArthur Fisher, David D. Logan, William Fraser, C.A. Campbell, M.\r\nMcCulloch, F.C.T. Arnoldi, Peter Munro.\r\n\r\nThe name chosen for the society was “The Medico-Chirurgical\r\nSociety of Montreal,” and at a meeting held the following week,\r\na code of by-laws was adopted providing for the holding of\r\nfortnightly meetings from the first of October until the first of\r\nMay, and for monthly meetings during the rest of the year.\r\n\r\nThe officers consisted of a secretary-treasurer--Dr. Francis\r\nBadgley for the first year--and a committee of management of\r\nthree, elected annually. The members, in the order in which\r\ntheir names appeared on the roll, presided at the meetings and\r\nthe president for the evening was also expected to provide the\r\nprincipal part of the programme.\r\n\r\nIn July, 1845, the constitution was altered to provide for a\r\npresident, two vice presidents, secretary-treasurer, and a\r\ncommittee of management of three, and in August, Dr. A.F. Holmes\r\nwas elected the first president. During the autumn of the same\r\nyear an attempt was made to form an association of all the\r\nlicensed practitioners of the provinces of Canada, and delegates\r\nfrom Toronto, Niagara, Quebec, Three Rivers and Montreal, met in\r\nMontreal, but failed to come to any agreement.\r\n\r\nA tariff of professional charges was adopted by the society in\r\nFebruary, 1846. All patients were divided into two classes and\r\nthe twenty-four hours were divided into three portions. Day\r\nvisits, 7 A.M. to 8 P.M.; evening visits, 8 P.M. to 10 P.M.;\r\nnight visits, 10 P.M. to 7 A.M.\r\n\r\nIn March, 1852, the meetings ceased to be held, but from what\r\ncause is not now evidenced by the minutes.\r\n\r\nThirteen years later an attempt was made to carry on the\r\nsociety, and a meeting of thirty French and English medical\r\nmen organized themselves into a society bearing the old name.\r\nDr. G.W. Campbell, dean of the faculty of medicine of McGill\r\nUniversity, was elected president. Two vice presidents, one\r\nFrench and one English, were appointed, and two secretaries, who\r\nkept the minutes, French and English, on opposite pages of the\r\nminute book, a system which evidently did not prove successful,\r\nthe society lasting less than two years on this basis. Dr. W. H.\r\nHingston was president during the second year.\r\n\r\nFour years later, on November 5, 1870, the old society was again\r\nreorganized with twenty-five members; Dr. G.W. Campbell was again\r\nchosen president and Dr. T.G. Roddick secretary-treasurer, a\r\nposition which he held for five years. Meetings were held every\r\nalternate Saturday in the Natural History Society’s rooms.\r\n\r\nFrom the date of the second reorganization the society has\r\ngrown rapidly and has now become established on a firm footing\r\nfinancially, and exercises an ever increasing influence on all\r\nmatters, pertaining to medical science. The fiftieth anniversary\r\nof its foundation was celebrated by a banquet at the Windsor\r\nHotel, on November 23, 1893. The meetings of this society are at\r\npresent held at 112 Mansfield Street.\r\n\r\n\r\n                 LA SOCIETE MEDICALE DE MONTREAL\r\n\r\nThe present association for the French-speaking medical men in\r\nthe city is represented by “La Société Médicale de Montréal” and\r\nwas established in 1900 under this name by the adoption of its\r\nstatutes on June 19th. It had existed, however, since 1875 as\r\nthe “Comité d’Etude.” Its meetings are held at Laval University\r\nand there are 200 members at present who meet twice a month. Its\r\nprincipal officers have been Doctors Hervieux, Demers, Benoit,\r\nDubé, Boucher, Marien, Foucher, A. Lesage, Boulet, Parizeau, P.\r\nMercier and J. Décarie. Its present president is Dr. A.D. Aubry\r\nand the secretary, G. Wilfred Derome.\r\n\r\n\r\n             THE COLLEGE OF PHYSICIANS AND SURGEONS\r\n                            (QUEBEC)\r\n\r\nThe College of Physicians and Surgeons is the corporate name of\r\nall the registered practitioners of the province, each one of\r\nwhom is styled a member.\r\n\r\nIts headquarters are at Montreal and its affairs are conducted\r\nby a board of governors, forty-one in number, elected for four\r\nyears; thirteen from the district of Quebec, sixteen from the\r\ndistrict of Montreal, six from the district of Three Rivers, and\r\nsix from the district of St. Francis.\r\n\r\nOf these forty-five, six are to be collegiate members: two from\r\nLaval University, at Quebec, two from Laval University, at\r\nMontreal, and two from McGill University.\r\n\r\nThis board of governors of the college is known as the Provincial\r\nMedical Board, and meets twice a year to perform its functions.\r\n\r\nThis board has the power to regulate the study of medicine, by\r\nmaking rules regarding the preliminary qualifications, duration\r\nof study, and curriculum.\r\n\r\nIt appoints every third year four persons actually engaged in\r\neducation in the province as matriculation examiners, and persons\r\ndesiring the license must qualify before these examiners before\r\nentering upon their professional studies.\r\n\r\nBy an amendment passed in 1890, holders of a degree of B.A.,\r\nB.S.C., or B.L., conferred by any Canadian or British university,\r\nare exempt from passing the preliminary examination.\r\n\r\nAs regards the professional requirements for the license,\r\nholders of a degree in medicine from Laval University, McGill\r\nUniversity, and the Montreal School of Medicine, are entitled to\r\nthe license by virtue of such degrees, without examination. The\r\nsame privilege is granted to registered practitioners of Great\r\nBritain, under the Imperial Medical Act of 1886. Other than the\r\ngraduates so mentioned, all candidates for the license, must pass\r\nan examination before the board.\r\n\r\nThe Provincial Medical Board also has power to fix the tariff of\r\nfees for professional services, and such tariff must have the\r\napproval of the lieutenant-governor in council, and be published\r\nin the Official Gazette six months before it becomes law.\r\n\r\nNo person may practise the profession of medicine in the province\r\nwho is not a member of the college, and he is liable to fine, and\r\neven imprisonment, for repeated offence. If guilty of felony, his\r\nname is removed from the register, and cannot again be registered.\r\n\r\n\r\n          THE BOARD OF HEALTH OF THE PROVINCE OF QUEBEC\r\n\r\nThe Board of Health of the Province of Quebec has its seat in the\r\nCity of Montreal. The board was appointed in August, 1887, under\r\nthe authority of an act passed by the Legislature in 1886, the\r\nyear following the very severe epidemic of small-pox in Montreal.\r\n\r\nUnder the authority of the Quebec Public Health Act, the board\r\nhas made and enforces through all the municipalities of the\r\nprovince by-laws relating to the prevention and limitation of\r\ninfectious diseases, the improvement of sanitation, the removal\r\nof nuisances, the wholesomeness of food, the sanitary conditions\r\nof habitations and factories, etc. Since 1894, no system of\r\nwaterworks and no sewerage system can be established without the\r\nboard having approved the plans thereof and this is also the case\r\nfor projected cemeteries. In 1893, the Legislature enacted the\r\nlaw of statistics by which the data contained in the registers\r\nof the civil status are made available to the board and this was\r\nthe origin of its division of vital statistics. In 1893, the\r\nboard established a bacteriological and chemical laboratory where\r\nrural municipalities can have their analyses made free of cost,\r\nas well as physicians the bacteriological diagnosis. In 1909, the\r\nboard organized a special division of sanitary-engineering for\r\nthe efficient betterment of the sanitation of water supplies and\r\nsewerage systems. In 1910, the board requested the Government to\r\nassent to the division of the province in ten sanitary districts\r\nunder “whole time” inspectors who possessed a diploma in public\r\nhealth. The delay in securing these sanitarians was the cause\r\nthat this district service could only be organized in the year\r\n1912.\r\n\r\nThe board has jurisdiction over the whole 1,164 municipalities\r\nthe province contains. It has power to require the organization\r\nof a local board of health in every municipality. Municipal\r\ncouncils are bound to execute all by-laws enacted by the\r\nprovincial board and whenever the latter find them too lax, it\r\nmay directly itself execute the by-laws at the expense of the\r\nmunicipalities in fault.\r\n\r\nThe board is composed at present (1914) of ten members, one of\r\nwhom is made president. The other officers are: the executive\r\nsecretary, the chief inspector of health, the recorder of vital\r\nstatistics, the bacteriologist, the chemist, the sanitary\r\nengineer and seven district inspectors. The president is Dr. E.\r\nPersillier-Lachapelle, and the secretary, Dr. E. Elzear Pelletier.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    THE CITY BOARD OF HEALTH\r\n\r\nThe Bureau of Health of Montreal came into effect through a\r\nby-law passed in the city council on the 10th of May, 1865.\r\nSubsequently, ten years later, this by-law was replaced by\r\nanother, No. 105, passed in 1876, under which the board now\r\noperates.\r\n\r\nThe board has jurisdiction over all matters of public health\r\nand is composed of the following sub-departments: contagious\r\ndiseases; medical inspection of schools: sanitary inspection;\r\nfood inspection; inspection of milk and dairy farms; statistics;\r\nmunicipal laboratories; the municipal medical service. The\r\nsanitary inspection department covers the general sanitation of\r\nthe dwellings, outhouses, lanes, etc.\r\n\r\nThe first health officer was Dr. Larocque, who served for about\r\ntwenty years, and was succeeded by Dr. Louis Laberge, who filled\r\nthe office for nearly thirty years. The present officer is Dr. S.\r\nBoucher, who was appointed December 1, 1913.\r\n\r\nThe by-law governing the bureau calls for a board to consist of\r\nthe mayor, nine aldermen of the city and nine citizens outside\r\nof the city council. This, however, has not been carried into\r\neffect. The board now consists of nine members, including the\r\nmayor and the health officer. The board is appointed by the city\r\ncouncil each year, in March, and the present board consists of\r\nMayor Martin, Alderman Letourneau, M.D., chairman; Alderman\r\nDubeau, Alderman Denis, M.D., Alderman Dubois, M.D., Alderman\r\nO’Connell, Alderman Blumenthal, Alderman Turcot, and the medical\r\nhealth officer, Dr. S. Boucher.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[1] The medical faculty of Bishop’s College has been abandoned\r\nsince 1905.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                          CHAPTER XXXIV\r\n\r\n                     SOCIOLOGICAL MOVEMENTS\r\n\r\n\r\n                                I\r\n\r\n            CARE OF THE AGED, FOUNDLINGS AND INFANTS\r\n\r\n  GREY NUNS--PROTESTANT ORPHAN ASYLUM--SISTERS OF PROVIDENCE--THE\r\n    CHOLERA EPIDEMIC OF 1832--L’ASILE DE MONTREAL--MONTREAL\r\n    LADIES BENEVOLENT SOCIETY--THE SHIP FEVER OF 1847--ST.\r\n    PATRICK’S ORPHANAGE--HERVEY INSTITUTE--PROTESTANT\r\n    INFANTS’ HOME--PROTESTANT INDUSTRIAL ROOMS--MONTREAL DAY\r\n    NURSERY--L’ASSISTANCE PUBLIQUE--OTHER INSTITUTIONS.\r\n\r\nA city’s life is not fully told unless the record of its\r\ncharitable, philanthropic and sociological progress is at least\r\nindicated. That of Montreal will be found to be full, inspiring\r\nand satisfactory. The following record is a study of movements\r\nand origins rather. It is not a directory. Nor is it in any\r\nway meant to be a comparative appreciation of the work done\r\nby the various societies or institutions mentioned. Its scope\r\nis historical. Innumerable obstacles stand in the way of the\r\npreparation of such a chapter as that now offered, but it should\r\nnevertheless be attempted if only to gather together as many as\r\npossible of the early links of the many excellent social works\r\nof the city and to bind them to those larger ones which have\r\nbeen forged by the present day busy workers who in their active\r\npresent are working busily and wholeheartedly for the growing\r\nneeds of the hour and have not, through one cause or another,\r\nthe historical means of surveying the early humble beginnings of\r\nworks with which they or others have linked their names and their\r\nself-sacrificing endeavours.\r\n\r\nThe first pioneer social movements of Montreal under British\r\nrule were those embracing the care of the aged and that of\r\nfoundlings and abandoned children. These were found together\r\nunder one roof but in different departments in the Hôpital\r\nGénéral of the “Grey Nuns” or the “Sisters of Charity” according\r\nto their official title. At the time of the capitulation the\r\nabove, with the Hôtel Dieu, founded on May 17, 1642, since the\r\nearly days of the colony, sufficed for the charitable needs of\r\nthe small community; for although the “Congregation” established\r\nin 1657 by Marguerite Bourgeoys, had cared for many orphans and\r\nthus in some sense might be said to have been the forerunner\r\nof the modern orphanages of the city and had shared in other\r\nsocial experiments, its work must be considered to have become\r\nspecifically educational. Again although the Hôtel Dieu also\r\nstill maintained, as it did until recent years, a number of\r\naged persons and orphans, its special function had been mostly\r\nexercised as a hospital for the sick. Its history having been\r\nalready told, that of the Grey Nunnery is now in place as the\r\npeculiar pioneering institution for the aged, orphans and general\r\ncharity under British rule.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          THE GREY NUNS\r\n\r\nOn taking possession of the Hôpital Général from the Charron\r\nFrères, in 1747, Madame d’Youville and her companions devoted\r\nthemselves to works of charity of every kind, receiving into the\r\ninstitution all classes of unfortunates without distinction of\r\nage or sex, never refusing any. During several years the Sisters\r\ncared for fallen women and had rooms for twelve. In 1756 a ward\r\nwas opened to receive English soldiers, sick and wounded, who\r\nhad been taken prisoners at Oswego under Shirley and Pepperel\r\nand others during the “Seven Years’ War” before the capitulation\r\nof Montreal. On September 7, 1760, the hospital being mistaken\r\nby the English as an outwork of defence, was about to be reduced\r\nby the cannon when a soldier ran to the general and on his knees\r\nimplored him to save the hospital where he and his companions\r\nhad been tended in the “Salle des Anglais.” The result was that\r\nthe officers went in and were hospitably received by Madame\r\nd’Youville with biscuits and wine.\r\n\r\nAfter the capitulation the hospital, as well as those of other\r\ncommunities in the town, suffered by the depreciation of paper\r\nmoney, receiving a very small percentage of its worth from the\r\nFrench government, thereby losing more than a hundred thousand\r\nfrancs.\r\n\r\nThe work of caring for abandoned children began on November 16,\r\n1754, but was not developed till shortly after the conquest in\r\n1760, when Madame d’Youville one day found the body of a little\r\nchild frozen in the ice with the dagger still in its throat and\r\nits little hands raised as in supplication for justice. This\r\nincident with others caused her to develop this work which was\r\nthen first undertaken systematically on this continent. Funds,\r\nhowever, were wanting. Under the old régime certain moneys had\r\nbeen appropriated for “enfants trouvés,” foundlings. The new\r\nmilitary government, approached by Madame d’Youville and the\r\nRev. M. Montgolfier, the brother of the inventor of the balloon,\r\nand the superior of the Seminary, could only procure a sum of\r\n288 francs. On September 13, 1771, Madame d’Youville approached\r\nthe sympathetic Governor Carleton, but with no good results.\r\nYet, in spite of the extreme poverty of the sisterhood the work\r\ncontinued, supported by their needlework. Another contributing\r\ncause for their poverty was the loss of their hospital in the\r\ngreat fire of May 18, 1765, which devastated the lower part\r\nof the town. This was more disastrous to them than the fire\r\nof 1745, for it reduced their home to ashes. The children and\r\nthe aged poor were about to be transferred to the barns of the\r\nfarm belonging to the Grey Nuns at Point St. Charles when M.\r\nMontgolfier came with an invitation from the nuns of the Hôtel\r\nDieu offering their hospitality. As, however, the number was too\r\nconsiderable, the nuns of the “Congregation” shared the problem\r\nof housing them. Not losing heart, Madame d’Youville dared, on\r\nthe 9th of June following, to begin rebuilding, relying on the\r\nsum of 6,000 francs contributed by the Montreal faithful and the\r\nIndians of the settlements of Caughnawaga and the Lake of Two\r\nMountains.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE GREY NUNNERY OF TODAY]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE OLD “GREY” NUNNERY As it looked from McGill\r\nStreet in the late ’60s before the new building was erected on\r\nDorchester Street. This site was that of the original General\r\nHospital, founded by M. Charron in 1692, and transferred to\r\nMadame D’Youville in 1747. A portion of these buildings still\r\nremains in 1912, being employed as warehouses. The new Custom\r\nHouse is to be built on this spot.]\r\n\r\nBut the Seminary came to her aid with a loan of 15,000 francs.\r\nBy order of M. Montgolfier the workmen laboured constantly, even\r\non Sundays, so that by September 23d the part for the aged men\r\nwas ready. The Sisters entered their convent on December 5th\r\nand the poor women on Christmas Day. The rest of the buildings\r\nwere not finished till 1767, the church being blessed on August\r\n30th. Though housed, money was very scarce; yet Madame d’Youville\r\nhad dared even nineteen days after the fire of 1765 to complete\r\na contract already arranged since August 25, 1764, for the\r\nacquistion of the seigneury of Chateauguay, originally accorded\r\nin 1673 by Frontenac to M. Lemoyne of Longueuil, and then\r\nbelonging to the family of Robutel de Lanouë. The development\r\nof this farm, which scarcely gave any revenue, was the object\r\nof the zealous solicitude of Madame d’Youville and now is the\r\nsanitarium and country house of the Grey Nuns for their different\r\nfoundations. The property of Point St. Charles was afterward\r\nbuilt upon for a country house for the children and the aged\r\npoor. It was burnt down in 1842 but re-erected in the following\r\nyear. The death of this “mulier fortis” occurred at 8:30 P.M. on\r\nDecember 23, 1771, at the age of seventy years after a life full\r\nof fatigues, privations and sacrifices. The work undertaken by\r\nher devoted followers has spread from Montreal far and wide. On\r\nOctober 7, 1871, the Mother House was removed from its oldtime\r\nposition “down town” to the block bounded by Guy Street, St.\r\nCatherine Street, Fort Street and Dorchester Street. The old\r\nbuildings were converted by merchants into warehouses, part of\r\nwhich are still standing. The new custom house, being erected in\r\n1914, marks the site of the southwest corner of their estate.\r\n\r\nThe following resumé of the work of the Grey Nuns is interesting:\r\n\r\n  In 1801, at the request of the government officials, the insane\r\n  were admitted and a special annex built. Previous to this, the\r\n  sisters had already received twenty-three such patients and until\r\n  this work was discontinued in 1839, the number received was 114.\r\n\r\n  In 1823, the community undertook the care of Irish orphan girls.\r\n\r\n  In 1846, at the request of the priests of the Seminary, a\r\n  “dispensary” for the poor was opened and a system of house to\r\n  house visitation was established.\r\n\r\n  In 1847, the sisters nursed the poor Irish immigrants stricken\r\n  with typhus fever.\r\n\r\n  In the same year a temporary “home” was opened for the women left\r\n  without resources after this terrible plague epidemic.\r\n\r\n  In 1849, at the request of the mayor of Montreal, the sisters\r\n  undertook the nursing of the cholera victims in the “sheds”\r\n  constructed for the typhus patients.\r\n\r\n  In 1851, St. Patrick’s Orphan Asylum was opened and the Grey Nuns\r\n  took charge.\r\n\r\n  In 1858, the first “kindergarten” conducted by the Grey Nuns in\r\n  Montreal was founded on Bonaventure Street by the Rev. Father\r\n  Rousselot, a Sulpician. It was known as Salle d’ Asile St.\r\n  Joseph, but was ultimately closed, because its proximity to the\r\n  railroad made it dangerous for the small children who came there\r\n  to school.\r\n\r\n  In 1861, the Nazareth Asylum for the Blind on St. Catherine\r\n  Street was opened.\r\n\r\n  In 1885, during an epidemic of small pox, forty Grey Nuns devoted\r\n  themselves to the care of the victims in their homes and in the\r\n  hospitals.\r\n\r\n  Since the days of their foundress, the Sisters each year have\r\n  provided for a certain number of poor students who board in the\r\n  establishment.\r\n\r\n  In the Mother House, on Guy Street, at present, the Grey Nuns\r\n  care for foundlings, orphan boys and girls, poor and aged men and\r\n  women, besides having an industrial school for young girls.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         THE FOUNDLINGS\r\n\r\n  The number of foundlings received annually is between four\r\n  hundred and fifty and five hundred. Since the founding, 37,168\r\n  infants have been admitted.\r\n\r\n  The number of children averages between one hundred and one\r\n  hundred and twenty. There are at present in the nursery 126.\r\n  The children who survive, when not kept in the nursery, are\r\n  either placed out to board or adopted by good families. In 1911,\r\n  fifty-five were adopted.\r\n\r\n  When about three years of age, the little children leave the\r\n  nursery and are placed with the orphans. These foundlings come\r\n  from all directions and belong to all nationalities.\r\n\r\n  A course of lectures has been opened at the nursery for the\r\n  training of children’s maids.\r\n\r\n                           THE ORPHANS\r\n\r\n  There are in the Grey Nunnery 300 orphans, of which 170 are boys\r\n  from three years to twelve years of age, and 130 girls from three\r\n  years to eighteen or twenty years of age.\r\n\r\n  Since 1748, when the first orphan girl was received, there have\r\n  been admitted 5,788 orphans, 2,875 boys and 2,913 girls.\r\n\r\n  From 1823 to 1873, these children were almost exclusively of\r\n  Irish origin. Since the latter date, the majority are from\r\n  Montreal, though some few are from the suburbs. Almost all are\r\n  French-Canadians, there being a few English speaking children and\r\n  some Indians. The greater number are received gratuitiously, very\r\n  few being able to pay their board.\r\n\r\n  At the age of twelve, the boys who are not claimed by relatives,\r\n  are placed at the orphanages of Montfort or of St. Arsène, or\r\n  adopted by respectable families.\r\n\r\n  The girls on leaving the orphanage enter the industrial school,\r\n  where they are taught domestic economy.\r\n\r\n  Those who have relatives wishing to claim them can leave. The\r\n  others are adopted by good families or placed out to earn their\r\n  living.\r\n\r\n                      THE INDUSTRIAL SCHOOL\r\n\r\n  The industrial school was opened in 1908. Since then 297 pupils\r\n  have been received, 270 of these being Canadians, 19 English and\r\n  8 Indians. There are at present 60 pupils in this department.\r\n\r\n  These young girls are employed in the different departments and\r\n  work rooms of the house.\r\n\r\n  In the sewing room they are taught sewing and mending as well as\r\n  knitting, embroidery, etc. In the kitchen, laundry, book bindery,\r\n  printing office and pharmacy, they are trained to become useful\r\n  members of society.\r\n\r\n  Several hours are also spent each day in the schoolroom.\r\n\r\n                       THE AGED AND INFIRM\r\n\r\n  There are 195 aged poor and infirm at present at the Mother\r\n  House, 95 men and 100 women.\r\n\r\n  Since the founding of the institution in 1747, 6,250 aged poor\r\n  and infirm have been received, of whom 2,952 were men and 3,298\r\n  women.\r\n\r\n  These comprise cripples of all kinds, and persons afflicted\r\n  with epilepsy or cancer. The number of the latter cases has\r\n  considerably diminished since the opening of the Hospital for\r\n  Incurables in Montreal.\r\n\r\n  Until 1910 the only grant from the provincial or municipal\r\n  authorities was $105.00, but the provincial government now grants\r\n  for the different works of charity an annual appropriation of\r\n  $2,905.00, in which is included the $105.00 for the nursery, the\r\n  expenses of which amount to $25,000.00 annually.\r\n\r\n  In 1910 and in 1911, the City of Montreal allowed $1,000.00\r\n  to the institution. In 1912, this allowance was increased to\r\n  $1,200.00. The balance of $98,550.00, which is the amount of\r\n  the annual expense for the support of the 660 inmates, must be\r\n  provided by the community. The average cost per capita is 41\r\n  cents a day.\r\n\r\n  Although there is no dispensary at the Grey Nunnery for outside\r\n  poor, these are continually assisted in many ways. Thus in 1911,\r\n  1,200 meals were given, and 300 persons were assisted materially.\r\n\r\n  Besides the Mother House, the Grey Nuns have in Montreal:\r\n\r\n  Three hospitals with training-schools: Notre Dame Hospital, St.\r\n  Paul’s Hospital, and the Ophthalmic Institute.\r\n\r\n  Four kindergartens: Nazareth, Bethlehem, St. Henry’s, and Ste.\r\n  Cunegonde’s.\r\n\r\n  Five orphanages: St. Patrick’s, St. Henry’s, Ste. Cunegonde’s,\r\n  Bethlehem, and St. Louis’.\r\n\r\n  One institution for the education of blind pupils.\r\n\r\n  Two homes for working girls: “Youville” and “Killarney.”\r\n\r\n  Three homes for the aged poor: St. Bridget’s, Ste. Cunégonde’s,\r\n  and St. Anthony’s.\r\n\r\n  One industrial school: St. Joseph’s.\r\n\r\n  In Canada, outside the City of Montreal they have:\r\n\r\n  One school at Côte-des-Neiges, one at Chateauguay, and one at St.\r\n  Benoit, with a home for infirm and aged women.\r\n\r\n  Four homes: in Varennes, Beauharnois, Chambly and Longueuil,\r\n  for aged and infirm women and orphans. A few lady boarders are\r\n  received in these homes to help support the works of charity. The\r\n  sisters visit the sick.\r\n\r\n  One hospital at St. John’s, with a home for old men and women;\r\n  also, a kindergarten.\r\n\r\n  In Western Canada, the Grey Nuns direct twenty-five\r\n  establishments, and in the United States, fourteen.\r\n\r\n\r\n                  THE PROTESTANT ORPHAN ASYLUM\r\n\r\nThe next movement for orphan children was on the part of the\r\nEnglish ladies who formed before 1822 a Female Benevolent\r\nSociety. This was followed by the “Protestant Orphan Asylum,”\r\nthe connecting link being provided as follows by the following\r\nextract from the original minutes.[1]\r\n\r\n“Upon the dissolution of the Female Benevolent Society in\r\nFebruary, 1822, the officers and members of that institution\r\nconsigned their orphan proteges and their flourishing little\r\nschool to the care and maintenance of the Protestant churches of\r\nthe city. The rector of the English Episcopal and the ministers\r\nof two Presbyterian churches accepted the charge.”\r\n\r\nFounded therefore in 1822, without endowment the Protestant\r\nOrphan Asylum trusted entirely to the generosity of interested\r\nfriends. The clergy of the city undertook to preach charity\r\nsermons for its benefit, and a substantial sum was thus raised.\r\nThe constitution of the new charity was framed by the Rev. John\r\nBethune, D.D., Dean of Montreal, and the Rev. Henry Esson, D.D.,\r\nPastor of St. Gabriel’s Presbyterian Church.\r\n\r\nThe first building occupied as an asylum (in 1833) was situated\r\nin St. Louis Street. The expenditure in this year was £211 10s\r\n4d. In 1838 removal was made to more commodious premises in St.\r\nAntoine Street, the expenditure that year being £248 4s 5d.\r\n\r\nIn 1848 the annual reports were first published, and in the\r\nspring of the same year the foundations of a new home were laid,\r\non land generously donated by Judge Smith on St. Catherine Street\r\nwhere Holland’s store now stands. This was sufficiently finished\r\nto permit the taking possession thereof June 4, 1849. The present\r\nbuilding at 93 Côte des Neiges Road, was completed and occupied\r\n1895.\r\n\r\nIt is interesting to compare the small beginnings of the earlier\r\nyears with present conditions. For instance, in 1833, as\r\npreviously stated, there was no endowment, and the expenditure\r\nfor the year was £211 10s 4d, about $846. In 1911 the market\r\nvalue of its endowment fund amounted to $178,962, yielding a\r\nrevenue of $9,143.50, and this with the annual subscriptions\r\nprovided for the year, $10,109.80.\r\n\r\nIn the annual report for the year 1859 attention is called to\r\nthe remarkable sanitary fact that out of upwards of six hundred\r\nchildren received into the home since its foundation, only\r\nforty-seven had died, notwithstanding the epidemic of cholera and\r\ntyphus fever, at different times prevalent. And it may be added\r\nthat this record has been maintained, and even surpassed, in the\r\nyears that have followed.\r\n\r\n\r\n             THE MONTREAL LADIES’ BENEVOLENT SOCIETY\r\n\r\nOn the occasion of the epidemic of cholera in 1832 there arose\r\na corresponding effort among the English Protestant ladies. The\r\nMontreal Ladies’ Benevolent Society was then founded “for the\r\npurpose of affording relief and support to destitute women and\r\nchildren” and the work which its founders inaugurated eighty-two\r\nyears ago has been carried on ever since. The Society was\r\nincorporated in 1841.\r\n\r\nThe list of its presidents previous to 1849 was destroyed by\r\nfire. Since 1849 the following ladies have served it as president:\r\n\r\n  1849--Mrs. Renaud.\r\n  1850--Mrs. Davidson.\r\n  1853--Mrs. Tulford.\r\n  1855--Mrs. Geddes.\r\n  1873--Mrs. Mackenzie.\r\n  1875--Mrs. Molson.\r\n  1876--Mrs. Vanneck.\r\n  1877--Mrs. Wheeler.\r\n  1882--Lady Galt.\r\n  1883--Mrs. Cramp.\r\n  1889--Mrs. Edwyn Evans.\r\n  1890--Mrs. Cramp.\r\n  1896--Mrs. John G. Savage.\r\n  1907--Mrs. Lachlan Gibb.\r\n  1910--Mrs. Alister Mitchell.\r\n  Honorary President--Countess Grey.\r\n\r\nMany names prominent in social and philanthropic work in Montreal\r\nduring that period are to be found on the roll of its past and\r\npresent committees.\r\n\r\nThe original building still stands with the added wings on\r\nOntario, formerly Berthelet, Street.\r\n\r\nThere are seven old women and ninety-eight children in the\r\nhome--fifty-two boys and forty-six girls between the ages of\r\nsix and fourteen years. Every effort is made to start these\r\nchildren suitably in life. But unfortunately, when they reach a\r\nwage-earning age, they are frequently taken away by their parents\r\nor nearest relatives, who up to this period have, more often than\r\nnot, ignored their existence--whereas if the children were only\r\nleft long enough in the home, they could receive special and\r\nindividual instruction and better positions could be found for\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nFifty-five destitute children and children of delinquent parents\r\nhave for many years been sent in through the city for whom the\r\ncity pays $7 per month for girls and $8 per month for boys. The\r\ncost of each child averages $13.75 per month.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    THE SISTERS OF PROVIDENCE\r\n\r\nThe succeeding movement in the charity for the aged, orphans\r\nand the poor was that started in 1828 by another Montreal lady,\r\nMadame Gamelin, who founded the “Sisters of Providence,” a\r\nreligious congregation, in 1843, the Asile de la Providence\r\nhaving been incorporated on September 11, 1841, and being erected\r\ncanonically in 1844.\r\n\r\nBy 1905 the congregation had spread over eighteen dioceses and\r\nhad seventy-seven houses. In 1913 it had ninety-seven houses. Its\r\nfoundress, Marie Emmeline Eugene Tavernier, was born on February\r\n19, 1800. On June 4, 1823, she was married to Jean Baptiste\r\nGamelin, a man of fifty, described in the marrage register as a\r\n“burgher,” the appellation then given to a proprietor living on\r\nhis income. Three children were born of the union. Two died three\r\nmonths after birth. In 1827 Mr. Gamelin died and the following\r\nyear the third child also. The widow’s heart now turned to the\r\naged and poor. On March 4, 1828, she opened a modest refuge on\r\nthe ground floor of a small parochial school, directed by the\r\nSisters of the Congregation of Notre Dame, situated on the corner\r\nof St. Lawrence and St. Catherine streets. The first beneficiary\r\nwas a widow named St. Onge, 102 years old. The refuge was shortly\r\nremoved to two houses rented on St. Philippe Street with her\r\ncharges, which soon reached the number of thirty, not always\r\nover-grateful.\r\n\r\nAbout this time Madame Gamelin formed a society of lady\r\nauxiliaries, Mesdames François Tavernier, E.R. Fabre, Maurice\r\nNolan, Augustine Tullock, R. St. Jean, Paul Joseph LaCroix,\r\nJoseph Gauvin, Simon Dalorme and Julien Tavernier. This society,\r\nfounded on December 13, 1827, and organized on December 18th\r\nof the same year, still exists as the “Society of the Ladies\r\nof Charity.” Each of these agreed to pay a monthly board for\r\none poor woman. During the cholera outbreak of 1832-1834\r\nMadame Gamelin did not spare herself in visiting the sick. The\r\n“yellow” house was secured for the growing needs of the refuge\r\nby M. Olivier Berthelet, whose name is linked with Montreal’s\r\ncharities. It was a modest frame building, two stories in\r\nheight, standing on St. Catherine and Hubert streets. During the\r\npolitical troubles of 1837-38 there commenced the work, still\r\npursued by her followers, of visiting the Montreal jails. Writing\r\nin his “Patriots of 1837-38” Mr. L.O. David, afterwards city\r\nclerk of Montreal, and a senator, said: “There are two names in\r\nparticular deserving of special mention and which the prisoners\r\nhave never forgotten, Madame Gamelin, who later became the\r\nfoundress of the Providence, and Madame Gauvin, mother of Doctor\r\nGauvin, who himself took part in the events of 1837.” In 1841\r\nMadame Gamelin’s asylum obtained civil incorporation through a\r\nmeasure, introduced by the Hon. D. Viger and the Hon. J. Quesnel,\r\nunder the name of “Corporation for Aged and Infirm Women of\r\nMontreal.”\r\n\r\nIn 1841 the work was so well founded that to secure its\r\npermanency as a constituted diocesan charity the ladies\r\nassociated with it, under the beautiful name of the Ladies of\r\nProvidence, determined to give it over to the Daughters of\r\nCharity of St. Vincent de Paul, then lately visited in Paris\r\nby Bishop Bourget. A new building was forthwith determined on\r\nto receive them, and for the funds for this, the first bazaar\r\nrecorded in Montreal was organized, in Rasco’s Hotel on St.\r\nPaul Street, on May 15, 16, 1842, and netted 500 louis. The\r\ndirectresses were Mesdames Gamelin, Gauvin, St. Jean, Fabre,\r\nLevesque, Boyer, Moreau and Lafontaine. Other sums were raised\r\nand the corner stone of the house opposite the “yellow” house\r\nwas blessed on May 10, 1842. About the middle of June, 1842,\r\nBishop Bourget gave Madame Gamelin and the Ladies of Providence a\r\nrule modelled upon that which St. Vincent de Paul had drawn up\r\nfor a society of ladies in Paris who had consecrated themselves\r\nto the work. The Daughters of St. Vincent de Paul did not come,\r\nafter all, and Bishop Bourget determined to create a diocesan\r\norder of the Sisters of Charity of Providence. On March 25,\r\n1843, the first clothing took place of the first six postulants\r\nin the “yellow” house, who were to obey Madame Gamelin as their\r\nsuperior. As yet she was not herself a religious, but on July\r\n8th, on one of the postulant’s returning to the world, Madame\r\nGamelin determined to take her place and she was accepted by the\r\nBishop as one of the new order of the Sisters of Providence, one\r\nof whose early works was to carry on the work of the care of the\r\naged and infirm already begun by Madame Gamelin in 1827. In 1860\r\nher institute established an asylum for “abandoned” children,\r\nFrench Canadian and Irish, which was opened on September 25th.\r\n\r\nThe work for the insane at Longue Pointe, begun in 1849, is told\r\nelsewhere.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       L’ASILE DE MONTREAL\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the year of the cholera, 1832, had seen the birth,\r\non July 18, of the “L’Asile de Mountréal pour les orphelins\r\nCatholiques Romains” or “Les Orphelins des Récollets,” so called\r\nbecause these orphans were first cared for in the convent\r\nof the Récollets. The asylum received its incorporation in\r\nSeptember, 1841. The work was promoted by a Sulpician, the\r\nRev. P. Phelan, and a widow, Madame Gabriel Cotté, who became\r\nits foundress and received her helpers from among the “Ladies\r\nof Charity.” Among the Ladies of Charity under whose auspices\r\nthe new work was placed and still continues, were those of the\r\nbest society of Montreal. The first president was Madame Marie\r\nCharles Joseph LeMoyne, Baroness de Longueuil, the wife of\r\nCaptain David Alexander Grant, of the Ninety-fourth Regiment,\r\nwho died on February 25, 1841. The vice presidents were Madame\r\nde Lothbinidère and Madame de Beaujeu. On the death of the\r\nBaroness de Longueuil she was succeeded as president by Madame\r\nBerthelet, Madame D.B. Viger, Madame C.S. Cherrier and Madame\r\nT. Bouthillier. Under the board of directors the asylum was\r\nconducted successively by Madame Chalifoux and Madamoiselle\r\nMorin. The present president is Madame J.O. Gravel and the vice\r\npresident is Madame Rosaire Thibaudeau, niece of the esteemed\r\nfoundress, Madame Cotté.\r\n\r\nThe institution has remained under lay control, although since\r\n1889 the Grey Nuns have been invited to undertake the internal\r\nmanagement. Madame Cotté was its first treasurer, being succeeded\r\nby her daughter, Madame Quesnel, who supported the work till her\r\ndeath. The foundress, Madame Cotté, endowed the work with a gift\r\nof land, that named “Pres de Ville,” on Lagauchetière Street, and\r\nwith a legacy in money. Her heirs exchanged the original land\r\nfor that on St. Catherine Street on which the institution stands\r\ntoday, a part of which was built by the legacies in money left by\r\nMadame Cotté and Madame Quesnel.\r\n\r\nIn 1913 the orphanage and grounds were sold and a spacious\r\nproperty bought for the new orphanage site at Notre Dame de\r\nGrâces. The new buildings have been commenced but have been\r\ninterrupted by the European war of 1914.\r\n\r\nThe dire year of 1847, that of typhus fever, saw great activity\r\namong all these French and English institutions for charitable\r\nworks. As the incoming immigrants were mostly Catholics the\r\nactivities of the Catholic institutions of the period may\r\nnaturally be recalled. The “Providence Sisters,” lately erected\r\nas a religious congregation, were called by Bishop Bourget to\r\nsecond the Grey Nuns, the Nuns of the Congregation and the Nuns\r\nof the Hôtel Dieu at the fever-stricken sheds at Point St.\r\nCharles. The work of caring for the 600 or more orphans of the\r\nemigrants was confided to the Sisters of Providence in the two\r\nprovisory hospitals. The religious of the Good Shepherd, who\r\nhad been called to Montreal in 1844, finally took charge of the\r\ngirls, and Madame Gamelin’s “Providence” Sisters took the boys\r\nto Mrs. Nolan’s house on St. Catherine Street. Bishop Bourget’s\r\npastoral letter of 1848 describing the transference of the\r\nchildren through the street states: “The spectacle of hundreds of\r\nchildren famishing with hunger, covered with rags and in danger\r\nof succumbing to the attacks of that terrible disease which had\r\ndeprived them of their parents was so poignant that it can never\r\nbe forgotten.” Twenty-seven of the “Providence” Sisters were\r\nstricken with the plague and three died, and similar disaster\r\nbefell other charitable “Congregations” or lay associations of\r\nall sections.\r\n\r\nOn the 1st of October the orphans were removed from their\r\ntemporary home in Mrs. Nolan’s house to the former convent of\r\nthe Good Shepherd, situated on Beaudry Street, then Black Horse\r\nStreet, the new Hospice of St. Jerome Emilianus. From the 11th\r\nof July Mother Gamelin had received 650 orphans. Of that number\r\n332 died and 188 were placed out or adopted. In the month of\r\nMarch, 1848, 130 remained in addition to 99 who stayed in the\r\nsheds at Point St. Charles. An appeal at this time was made by\r\nBishop Bourget and colleges, convents and lay people responded\r\nin adopting the children. Sixty remained with the Sisters of\r\nProvidence and were distributed among the different houses or\r\napprenticed to trades. “In adopting these poor children,” says\r\nthe same pastoral, “they will become our companions in faith,\r\ngood priests, fervent religious, excellent citizens,” as, indeed,\r\nthey did.\r\n\r\n\r\n                   THE ST. PATRICK’S ORPHANAGE\r\n\r\nThis leads up naturally to the history of the Irish Catholic\r\ncharities, and of the St. Patrick’s Orphanage, in particular.\r\n\r\nBefore 1800 few Irish reached the city, yet they came early in\r\nthe nineteenth century, so that by 1823 the number of orphan\r\nchildren of Irish parentage was such that M. Roux, the superior\r\nof the Sulpicians, arranged with the Grey Nuns[2] to receive the\r\nfirst five of forty children in the “Salle des petites orphelines\r\nIrlandaises” which was opened February 14, 1823. Until 1886 the\r\nSulpicians unostentatiously supported no less than 848 little\r\nIrish orphans.\r\n\r\nIn the fall of the year of “Black ’47” the Rev. M. Pinsonneault\r\nrented a house on Colborne Street of fifteen apartments, in which\r\nhe lodged fifty families of those who, though destitute, had\r\nescaped the terrible ship fever. This was known as the “House.”\r\nMrs. Brown, a good Catholic Irishwoman, undertook to teach the\r\nchildren and M. Pinsonneault founded a band of ladies for the\r\npurposes of organizing bazaars for the support of the struggling\r\ninstitution which was even vilified in the press. The “Ladies of\r\nCharity” were organized in 1849 as a permanent body to assume the\r\nupkeep of the work and to collect subscriptions.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile during the visitation of 1847 it was rendered necessary\r\nfor 650 little Irish orphans to be taken from the pest sheds of\r\nPoint St. Charles and taken care of, as is told elsewhere, by\r\nthe religious daughters of Mother Gamelin, the foundress of the\r\nSisters of Providence.\r\n\r\nOn June 20, 1848, Father Dowd had arrived and, being appointed\r\nin September almoner of the poor, he became superior of the\r\nHouse. He quickly determined that a new asylum was needed. This\r\nwas secured in a small house on Craig Street, opposite the Champ\r\nde Mars, generously loaned by M. Augustin Perreault, who added\r\nnumerous other benevolent gifts and services. In October, 1849,\r\nthe asylum was opened and Mrs. Brown was joined by Mrs. McMahon,\r\nbetter known as Mrs. “Mack.” A fire on June 9, 1850, nearly\r\nthreatened the existence of the new house.\r\n\r\nAbout 1850 a parishioner of St. Patrick’s church, M. Bartholomew\r\nO’Brien, bequeathed a sum of £1,000 for an orphan asylum. Father\r\nDowd formed a building committee of Messrs. Charles T. Palgrave,\r\nFrancis McDonnell, Charles Curran, P. O’Meara, P. Lawlor, J.\r\nMcGovern, Patrick Brennan, Thomas O’Brien, Patrick Lynch and\r\nMathew Ryan. The latter acted as secretary till February, 1850,\r\nwhen he was succeeded by Mr. Thomas Bell. A lot of ground, 100\r\nfeet by 10 in front on Dorchester Street, with 120 feet of rear,\r\nwas given, in trust for the building of an Irish orphan asylum by\r\nthe Fabrique of the parish of Montreal.\r\n\r\nOn November 21, 1851, the unfinished house was entered by the\r\norphans, two or three planks laid against the principal entrance\r\nbeing the only door. The formal blessing of the building by the\r\nbishop took place on February 2, 1852. In this same year the\r\ntreasurer, Mr. T.C. Palgrave, received a grant of £500 from the\r\nprovincial parliament. The act of incorporation received the\r\nroyal assent on May 30, 1855. In 1859 Father Dowd resigned his\r\ndirectorship, leaving a balance to the poor of $157.39. He was\r\nsucceeded by the Rev. Michael O’Brien, who afterwards became the\r\nfirst superior of St. Ann’s church. In 1861 Mr. Edward Murphy,\r\nafterwards senator, joined the board of trustees, becoming\r\nsecretary in the place of Mr. Bell.\r\n\r\nHis Excellency, Viscount Monck, governor-general, visited the\r\norphan asylum on July 3, 1862, when an address was read by Mr.\r\nThomas Ryan, afterwards senator. On the death of Mr. Bell, in\r\n1864, Mr. John Fitzpatrick became a trustee. Dying in the same\r\nyear, he made the orphanage his residuary legatee.\r\n\r\nThrough the efforts of the indefatigable Father O’Brien there\r\nwas acquired the property on Lagauchetière Street, where the\r\nSt. Bridget’s Refuge was afterwards built, the act of the\r\ntransference by the corporation of the asylum to the refuge by\r\nresolution being dated June 24, 1866. In 1859 it was proposed\r\nto build St. Bridget’s church for the Irish in the Quebec\r\nsuburbs and money was collected, but, as the bishop could not\r\nbe prevailed upon to permit its creation, at a meeting of\r\nsubscribers held on March 9, 1867, it was resolved unanimously\r\non the motion of Mr. B. Devlin, and seconded by Mr. M.P. Ryan,\r\nthat the money collected (about $8,000) by Fathers O’Brien\r\nand O’Farrell (afterwards bishop of Trenton) be appropriated\r\nas follows: “one-half to the Montreal St. Patrick’s Orphan\r\nAsylum and the other half to the Rev. Father O’Farrell and\r\nhis successors for Irish Catholic charities in the St. Ann’s\r\nsuburbs, the whole to be invested by them in stock in the new St.\r\nPatrick’s Hall, now in course of erection.”\r\n\r\nThe history of the ill-starred St. Patrick’s Hall, a magnificent\r\nstructure, a credit to the Irish people of the city, tells of\r\ntwo disasters, in the last of which it perished by fire. The\r\nassociation determined to wind up its affairs, which resulted in\r\nthe stockholders receiving 55% for their investment, the asylum\r\nbeing, therefore, a considerable loser.\r\n\r\nOn the death of the Rev. Michael O’Brien in 1870 Father Dowd\r\nwas again appointed director by the bishop. In 1877 there was\r\nterminated a long dispute which was settled in the ecclesiastical\r\ncourt, resulting in the non-divergence of the funds, originally\r\ncollected for St. Bridget’s church and given with the consent\r\nof the subscribers, half to the orphan asylum and half to the\r\nFabrique of St. Marys, who claimed the original gift for the\r\nSt. Bridget’s church, when permission to build this had been at\r\nlast granted by the bishop in 1873. The case for the asylum in\r\ncivil law was entrusted by the trustees to Mr. J.J. Curran, Q.C.,\r\nM.P., afterwards the Hon. Justice Curran, his view in favour of\r\nthe asylum being endorsed by Mr. Lacoste, Q.C., afterwards Sir\r\nAlexander Lacoste, chief justice, K.B.\r\n\r\nIn January, 1873, Lord Dufferin, the distinguished Irish governor\r\ngeneral, visited the asylum. On January 30, 1874, Sister Forbes,\r\nwho since 1853 had succeeded Sister Reed as superioress of the\r\nasylum, celebrated her “golden wedding” as a nun. Mother Forbes\r\ndied three years later, on March 28, 1877, after her twenty-third\r\nyear in the superiority of the asylum, to the great grief of the\r\nIrish population.\r\n\r\nThe last of the original trustees died on May 26, 1889, the\r\nHon. Thomas Ryan, senator for the Victoria division of the\r\nprovince. On the 26th of December, 1889, the following gentlemen\r\nwere trustees, Edward Murphy, J.S. Mullin, W.H. Hingston, Owen\r\nMcGarvey, James O’Brien, John B. Murphy, Patrick Kennedy,\r\nHon. Judge Doherty, James McCready, J.J. Curran, Q.C., M.P.\r\nIn December, 1891, Father Dowd died. He was held in greatest\r\nrespect by all denominations in the city. The flag on the city\r\nhall was placed at half mast and the funeral was a public\r\ndemonstration. He was succeeded by Father Quinlivan, who had\r\nassisted him for some time before his death. In 1892 the Hon.\r\nSenator Murphy died. His name deserves to be remembered among the\r\ngreat philanthropists of the city. His memory is perpetuated in\r\nthe “Edward Murphy School” and the Edward Murphy medal given by\r\nthe Catholic School Commissioners. In 1902 the trustees of the\r\norphanage were Hon. Sir William Hingston, Hon. Marcus Doherty,\r\nHon. J.J. Curran, J.S.C., Mr. Michael Burke, Mr. Patrick Mullin,\r\nHon. James O’Brien, Mr. J.C. Collins, Mr. C.A. McDonnell and Mr.\r\nP. McCrory.\r\n\r\nIn 1909 the orphanage, being declared unsafe, was removed to\r\nthe new asylum built under the direction of Mr. W.E. Doran,\r\narchitect, of gray stone, fireproof and three stories in height,\r\non St. Catherine Road, Outremont. The estate is a valuable farm\r\nof forty-five acres, with its own orchards and vegetable gardens.\r\nIts internal direction is still under the Grey Nuns. Its trustees\r\nat the time of the change were the Rev. Gerald McShane, pastor of\r\nSt. Patrick’s church, the Hon. C.J. Doherty, Messrs. M. Burke, P.\r\nMullin, C.F. Smith, C.A. McDonnell, P. McCrory, J.A. Macdonald,\r\nM.D., who has also given his services free for thirty years,\r\nand Donald Hingston, M.D. At present Messrs. A.J. Trihey, H.J.\r\nMcKeon, T.W. McNulty, W.J. Rafferty, have joined the board since\r\nthe deaths of Messrs. M. Burke, C.F. Smith, C.A. McDonnell and P.\r\nMullin.\r\n\r\nThe names of Dr. H. Schmidt, Dr. Henry Howard, Dr. J.A.\r\nMacdonald, Dr. Thomas J. Curran, should be remembered in\r\nconnection with the medical care of the orphans.\r\n\r\nThe great burden of sustaining the funds of the institution\r\nfell during many years on the “Ladies of Charity.” The first\r\nannual bazaar was held in 1849 under their auspices. The first\r\npresident was Mrs. Charles Wilson, the wife of the Hon. Charles\r\nWilson, mayor of the city. In 1850 she was succeeded by Madame\r\nVallières de St. Réal, the wife of the well known judge. This\r\nIrish lady remained president till 1861. Mrs. O’Meara succeeded\r\nbut died in 1862, when Madame Vallières was recalled till 1866,\r\nwhen she was made honorary life president. Mrs. M.P. Ryan\r\nbecame president till 1882, when with Mrs. Campion she became\r\nhonorary life president. Mrs. Brennan took office in 1882, and\r\nMrs. Edward Murphy in 1883, remaining till 1900. In 1900 the\r\nfollowing ladies were installed in office: Mrs. M.P. Ryan, Mrs.\r\nCampion and Mrs. E. Murphy, honorary life presidents; Mrs. E.C.\r\nMonk, president; Mrs. E.C. Amos, vice president; Mrs. D. Boud,\r\nsecond vice president; Mrs. Loye, third vice president; Mrs.\r\nWhitney, secretary. Of late years this organization has not been\r\ncalled upon for the same active services for the orphanage, but\r\ntheir members individually have been foremost in other growing\r\nEnglish-speaking Catholic charities.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      THE HERVEY INSTITUTE\r\n\r\nAmong non-Catholic charitable works called forth at the time of\r\nthe ship fever was the Hervey Institute, founded in 1847.\r\n\r\nIts first home was on St. Antoine Street; two small houses\r\nfollowed. Then the Home found itself at 215 Mountain Street,\r\nin 1875. The new Home, opened by their Excellencies, Earl and\r\nCountess Grey, on December 16, 1908, is situated at the corner of\r\nWindsor and Claremont avenues, Westmount.\r\n\r\nLike most similar organizations the Hervey Institute rose from\r\nhumble beginnings, little idea being in the minds of the group of\r\nladies who began the work of the magnitude of the scale of future\r\nundertakings. It now has accommodation for eighty-five persons.\r\n\r\nMiss Hervey, for whom the Home is named, was born in 1807 and\r\ncame to this city from Scotland in 1846. The following year she\r\nstarted the home in a small way, calling it an industrial home.\r\nShe was led to do this by the extreme need for such among the\r\npoor--for at that time there was little organized relief among\r\nthe Protestants other than that given by the churches--and the\r\nmother left with her small children to support, owing to the\r\ndeath of the father, was in a sad plight. Miss Hervey and her\r\nassociates gathered these children together, taught them to sew\r\nand also the elementary subjects of education as well as the\r\nperformance of domestic duties.\r\n\r\nAmong well known names connected with the Home in those days were\r\nMrs. John Stirling, Mrs. John Redpath, Mrs. Neil MacIntosh, Mrs.\r\nJohn McDougall, Mrs. Hannibal Whitney, Mrs. John Lovell--the last\r\nmentioned still showing an active interest in the Home--Mrs.\r\n(Doctor) Scott, another member of the original committee, worked\r\nunceasingly to accomplish a piece of work desired by Miss Hervey,\r\nthat of a separate Home for the tiny children and young babies,\r\nas it was found impossible to continue the reception of children\r\nof all ages. Thus the Protestant Infants’ Home was established,\r\nas an offshoot in 1870, by this same untiring worker, Miss Hervey.\r\n\r\nThe following ladies have been the presidents of the institution:\r\n\r\n  1847-75      Miss Hervey\r\n  1875-78      Mrs. H.L. Routh\r\n  1878-81      Mrs. J. Ross\r\n  1881-82      Mrs. James Tasker\r\n  1882-86      Mrs. J.H. Moody\r\n  1886-92      Mrs. Alex Murray\r\n  1892-96      Mrs. Langlois\r\n  1896-1904    Mrs. G. Summer\r\n  1904         Mrs. J. Henderson\r\n\r\nThe Home was incorporated in 1875 when Mrs. J. Routh was\r\npresident, other signers of the charter were: Mrs. Holmes and\r\nMrs. M.L. Clarke, the last mentioned being at present on the\r\ncommittee of management. The original intention of caring for,\r\nteaching, and training in domestic duties half orphan girls,\r\nhas been carried on, but more than that, the special provision\r\nmade for boys in the comparatively new Home on Windsor Avenue,\r\nWestmount, shows the result of many anxious thoughts directed to\r\nthe problem of the growing boy without a home. Boys as well as\r\ngirls are now trained for their work in the world; boys are kept\r\nuntil fourteen years of age, girls until sixteen.\r\n\r\nIn receiving girls and boys into the Home, the idea is to keep\r\nfamily life as nearly normal as possible, so the mother or father\r\nmay place their children in the same home knowing they are at\r\nschool and may play together.\r\n\r\nHalf-orphan children, between the ages of five and fourteen, are\r\nreceived, qualified teachers are in attendance, one children’s\r\ntrained nurse and other nurses and over all a superintendent.\r\n\r\nThe parent pays whatever possible; all other cost of maintenance\r\nis met by the voluntary subscriptions.\r\n\r\nA development of late years has been the purchase of a summer\r\nhome at Morin Heights in the Laurentian Mountains, in healthy and\r\nbeautiful surroundings. It is owing to this annex, to which the\r\nchildren have been sent for two months for nine years, that the\r\ndirectors owe the wonderful record of no annual drug account over\r\n$25.00. This for a home of seventy-five children is a record, as\r\nis the fact there have been but four deaths in the sixty-eight\r\nyears in which the Home has been in operation.\r\n\r\nSince the inception in 1847 many hundreds have passed through the\r\nHome and have made successes. The girls have become efficient\r\nnurses and teachers and the boys successful business men, while\r\ntwo of the more recent inmates are doing their duty by their King\r\nand Country in the Canadian overseas contingent.\r\n\r\n\r\n                  THE PROTESTANT INFANTS’ HOME\r\n\r\nAs mentioned, it was through the energy of Miss Hervey and Miss\r\nScott that the Protestant Infants’ Home was established on\r\nApril 30, 1870, the by-laws being adopted on that date and the\r\nconstitution in May following. The first home of Miss Hervey’s\r\nInstitute was on St. Antoine Street. It was destined to receive\r\nunmarried mothers, together with their babies from the Maternity\r\nHospital as well as destitute children and even those paid for.\r\nThe age for children admitted is between fourteen days and five\r\nyears.\r\n\r\nAmong the first directors were Mesdames Henry Baylis, J.M.\r\nGibson, G. Ferrier, F. Henshaw, B. Christie, T. Campbell, J.\r\nAlexander, I. Harper, G. Brown, C. Hart, G. Aitken, Aikman, W.H.\r\nClare, Godfrey G. Shaw, C. Pelton, Scott, Wilk, and C. Brown.\r\n\r\nThe home was transferred from St. Antoine Street to different\r\nplaces and is now located on Queen Mary’s Road.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    THE MONTREAL DAY NURSERY\r\n\r\nThis was followed on the English side by the Montreal Day\r\nNursery, located at 50 Belmont Park, which was started in 1888\r\nand incorporated in 1900.\r\n\r\nThe object of the Day Nursery is to take care of the children of\r\nwomen who, for various reasons, are obliged to work by the day to\r\nsupport their families. The Nursery is open every week day from\r\n7 A.M. to 7 P.M. Children from three weeks to twelve years of\r\nage are admitted by the day. They are fed, kept clean, medically\r\ntreated, and, when necessary, clothed. The younger children\r\nare under the supervision of a resident governess, the older\r\nones are sent to the Belmont Street and St. Patrick’s schools.\r\nThe Nursery is non-sectarian, there are no restrictions as to\r\ncreed, nationality or colour, and it is supported by voluntary\r\ncontributions.\r\n\r\nWhen the Nursery was first opened about ten children were taken\r\ncare of daily. The increase in numbers has been steady until now\r\nthere are from ninety-five to one hundred and ten cared for,\r\ndivided as follows: Infants, twenty; runabouts, between two and\r\nfour, forty; and about fifty between the ages of four and twelve.\r\nA charge of ten cents is exacted for one child, and five cents\r\nmore for each additional child from the same family.\r\n\r\nThe Montreal Foundling and Baby Hospital was started in 1891 and\r\nhas admirably carried out its title.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      L’ASSISTANCE PUBLIQUE\r\n\r\nA modern form of charity for the old and sick and for children\r\nwas founded on October 30, 1903, by MM. L.H. Lesvesque, Joseph\r\nHoostetter, A. Rivet, Ludger Gravel, G. L’Archevesque, Leo\r\nFournier, Charlemagne Rodier, Dr. E. H. Desjardins, under the\r\nname of L’Assistance Publique, situated on 338-340 Lagauchetière\r\nStreet. Its incorporation is dated January 28, 1907. Its\r\nobject is the protection, housing, boarding and clothing,\r\ntemporarily as long as the board shall see fit, of children,\r\nwomen, old people, the sick and other afflicted persons (with\r\nthe exception of those suffering from incurable or contagious\r\ndiseases). It aims at finding employment, or placing those in\r\ntheir charge into suitable charitable institutions. The work\r\nis restricted to citizens of Montreal, of all nationalities.\r\nThe work has progressed so that it became necessary to build a\r\nlarge wing, which was inaugurated on February 5, 1911. It has\r\nfour dormitories, an infirmary and three refectories. Over one\r\nhundred and five aged and poor persons dwell permanently in\r\nthe hospital. The institution does not lodge casuals, this work\r\nbeing abandoned on the erection of the Meurling Institute in\r\n1913, but it serves dinners to needy unemployed. The society is\r\nadministrated by lay people, of whom the present officers are:\r\nMM. Joseph Lamoureux, president; A.A. Labresque, vice president;\r\nTrefflé Bastien, treasurer; and A. Godin, secretary. The internal\r\nmanagement of the home for ten years has been in the hands of\r\nMlle. Morache.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              NOTE\r\n\r\nThe foregoing are types of the leading philanthropic institutions\r\nconcerned in the movement for the care of the aged, orphans and\r\nchildren.

VINCENT DE PAUL SOCIETY--THE\r\n    OLD BREWERY MISSION--THE SALVATION ARMY SOCIAL WORK--THE CHARITY\r\n    ORGANIZATION SOCIETY--THE MEURLING MUNICIPAL REFUGE--OTHER RELIEF\r\n    AGENCIES.\r\n\r\n\r\n                 THE PROTESTANT HOME OF INDUSTRY\r\n\r\nThe beginning of the nineteenth century marked a decided growth\r\nin the English population and there can now be seen its efforts\r\nto organize its relief work. The present chapter will also\r\nindicate the progress of the movement towards organized charity.\r\n\r\nIn 1818, an act was passed forming a corporation of the “Wardens\r\nof the House of Industry at Montreal.” This was in order to\r\ncarry out the wish of a John Conrad Marsteller, who in 1808 had\r\nleft two stone houses and other buildings on St. Mary Street for\r\nthe erection of a House of Industry, but the amount not being\r\nsufficient, there was delay till the act of 1818 created the\r\n“wardens” or overseers and visitors of the poor. No regular steps\r\nseem to have been taken for the appointment of these wardens till\r\nApril 2, 1827, when a commission, signed by the Governor General,\r\nEarl Dalhousie, appointed as wardens of the House of Industry,\r\nFrançois Desrivières, Saveuse de Beaujeu, Samuel Gerard, Jean\r\nBouthillier, Horatio Gates, Rèné Kimber, Henry McKenzie and James\r\nKimber.\r\n\r\nIn 1863 an act of incorporation was granted for a “Protestant\r\nHouse of Industry.” A building site was secured at the corner\r\nof Dorchester and Bleury streets, for which the proprietor,\r\nMr. John Donegani, was paid £3,750. Upon this property a large\r\nbrick building was erected, three stories in height with a\r\nhigh basement. It became the center of sociological activity.\r\n“During the year 1865,” says Mr. Sandham, the historian, “the\r\nmissionaries of the different religious societies formed\r\nthemselves into a City Missionary Relief Society and were\r\nliberally aided by the citizens in carrying on their work. The\r\nfollowing year it was thought advisable that all assistance\r\nshould flow out through one channel and accordingly a United\r\nBoard of Outdoor Relief was formed in connection with the\r\ninstitution.” This institution is still in operation in the city.\r\n\r\n\r\n                   ST. VINCENT DE PAUL SOCIETY\r\n\r\nSt. Vincent de Paul Society, to which no work of charity is\r\nforeign, started poor visiting and relief in Montreal in 1848.\r\nThe parent body was originally formed in Paris in May, 1833, by\r\neight students under the direction of M. Bailly, the general\r\ncouncil being established at Paris in 1840, and the particular\r\ncouncil of Montreal being founded on March 18, 1848. The city\r\nis now divided into the central, northern, eastern and western\r\nparticular councils with local parish conferences to each. In\r\nDecember, 1914, these were more than fifty-four.\r\n\r\n\r\n                     THE OLD BREWERY MISSION\r\n\r\nAn English exponent of a further phase of the relief movement is\r\nthe Old Brewery Mission, which was established in 1890 under the\r\nfollowing circumstances:\r\n\r\nAbout the middle of the winter of 1890 there were many suffering\r\nfrom cold and hunger through lack of work. A suggestion came\r\nthat much good might be done could a soup-kitchen be opened\r\nto furnish cheap and nourishing food to the needy. A suitable\r\nplace was found in an old house on Dalhousie Street. There were\r\ntwo rooms. The back one was used as a kitchen--the one in front\r\nas a reading-room. It was furnished with benches and tables on\r\nwhich were magazines. A grate-fire made the place homelike and\r\ncheerful. Young ladies voluntarily served the soup. As the place\r\nbegan to get crowded, it was thought best to have short addresses\r\ndelivered to the men. The work was so satisfactory and evidently\r\nso badly needed that when the old house was torn down in the\r\nspring, larger quarters were found in an old brewery (hence the\r\npresent name) on College Street. After this the work so grew\r\nthat a missionary was engaged and regular evangelistic services\r\nwere held. But there was so many disadvantages about this place,\r\nand the locality was found so unsuitable, that another site\r\nwas chosen--a shop on St. James Street, near Inspector Street.\r\nAbout this time the movement was started to put up the present\r\nbuilding, where for fourteen years the work has flourished.\r\n\r\n\r\n                 THE SALVATION ARMY SOCIAL WORK\r\n\r\nIn 1884 the Salvation Army came to Montreal and its method of\r\norganized charity work has been one of gain to the city.\r\n\r\nEarly in its life the rescue work for men was instituted, as\r\nhas been recorded. That for women and girls was also early\r\ninaugurated and this latter has since remained one of the\r\nimportant branches of the Army’s activities. Today the Young\r\nWomen’s lodge receives young women and girls who are employed,\r\nfurnishing pleasant rooms and good board at a nominal rate and at\r\nthe same time a safe and congenial home.\r\n\r\nIn addition to this work the Army opened up, on the 1st of\r\nFebruary, 1899, at 398 St. Antoine Street, a Working Women’s\r\nHome, where floor scrubbers, window cleaners, etc., are furnished\r\nroom and board within their means and also employment when\r\nneeded. During the last year 11,494 beds were occupied in this\r\ndepartment and positions were found for 3,860 women.\r\n\r\nWith the erection of the Metropole, about 1903, the training\r\ncollege was removed to Toronto and this building became the home\r\nfor the Social Corps for men. Board and lodgings are furnished at\r\na small price to those able to pay and employment is found for\r\nthose in need thereof.\r\n\r\nThe Industrial Home for men is located on Chatham Street, and\r\nhere, if employment is not found for applicants within a week,\r\nthey are put to work for the Army until permanent employment is\r\nsecured. At this place there is a store, with departments for\r\nfurniture repairing, shoe repairing, tailoring and paper sorting.\r\nThe men are put to work at repairing furniture and shoes which\r\nare secured by the workers of the Army from all over the city,\r\nand these repaired articles are sold at the store at very low\r\nprices, the sale taking place about noon of each day. There, poor\r\npeople, who are reluctant to ask for charity, are allowed to\r\npay a very small price for furniture, clothes, shoes, etc., and\r\nthereby retain their independence. The material sold is fashioned\r\nfrom donations taken from all over the city and waste matter\r\ngenerally. In this way the aim of the Army is accomplished,\r\nto bring the waste matter of the city and the “down-and-outs”\r\ntogether, thus utilizing the one and saving the other with\r\nabsolutely no cost to the city. The Industrial Home, through this\r\nmeans and through the sale of waste paper, which, when sorted,\r\nthey are able to dispose of to the very best advantage and\r\ncommand the best price, is practically self-supporting, and the\r\nmen are not only given board and lodging while waiting to find\r\npermanent employment, but also are paid a sum of money for their\r\nservices, which they are advised to save up as a reserve capital\r\nupon which to start in their new line of work when secured.\r\n\r\nThe Army has recently purchased a lot at 520 Outremont Avenue,\r\nupon which it is planned to build a large building for hospital\r\npurposes.\r\n\r\n\r\n                THE CHARITY ORGANIZATION SOCIETY\r\n\r\nThe advent of the most modern form of organized charity work\r\nin Montreal dates from 1894, for in that year the Charity\r\nOrganization Society really came into being, though it did not\r\ncome officially into the name until 1900. The incorporators of\r\nthe Society were George Hague, Lady Drummond, Charles F. Smith,\r\nEmanuel P. Lachapelle, Harry Bovey, Louis J. Forget, Herbert\r\nB. Ames, Frank J. Hart, Mrs. Margaret Thibeaudeau, Sir William\r\nHingston, Lady Margaret Hingston, Joseph B. Learmont, Mrs.\r\nCharlotte Learmont, John C. Reid, Frederick L. Beique, John Cox,\r\nMrs. Caroline O. Cox, R. Wilson Smith, J. Damien Rolland, Robert\r\nCraig, Miss Helen Reid, Jeffrey H. Burland, Trefflé Berthiaume,\r\nDaniel F. Hamilton and Alphonse Turcotte.\r\n\r\nIts work began in the former year when the Local Council of\r\nWomen took up the question of organized charity relief work.\r\nIt collected and studied trunks full of information about it,\r\nmastered its principles and details, went about explaining it,\r\ndrew up a constitution and was ready. Then, in conjunction with\r\na number of influential men, it called a public meeting in the\r\nold Board of Trade hall, in December, 1899. Lady Minto came from\r\nOttawa to be present. The hall was packed, and there and then,\r\nwith much enthusiasm, the resolution was taken and the Charity\r\nOrganization Society shortly opened its doors at 98 Bleury\r\nStreet. There it remained for some twelve years, till last May it\r\nopened its new office at 70 Mance Street. Its first secretary,\r\nMr. Francis McLean, guided it with wisdom and discretion through\r\nthose first critical years. Then came the late Mr. Richard Lane,\r\nwho won for it wide recognition and sympathy, through his unusual\r\ngifts and personality. At his death he was succeeded, about 1911,\r\nby Mr. Rufus Smith.\r\n\r\nThe work as developed by this association, in league with others\r\nof the same world-wide reputation for scientific efficiency in\r\nrelief management, is an important factor in civic sociology.\r\nThe society is very fortunate in having among its directors many\r\nof the original incorporators, who are all connected with divers\r\nother charities in this city, so that this central board has\r\nfar-reaching influence as a bureau of exchange in the solution of\r\nrelief problems.\r\n\r\n\r\n                  THE MEURLING MUNICIPAL REFUGE\r\n\r\nThe latest relief movement in Montreal is the Meurling Municipal\r\nRefuge, installed by the municipality. Its establishment was\r\nbrought about through a windfall in the form of a donation by a\r\nformer Montreal citizen, Mr. Gustave Meurling, who died recently\r\nin France.\r\n\r\nOn the 19th of May, 1913, the contract was awarded for the\r\nerection of the Meurling Municipal Refuge to Mr. Théodore Lessard\r\nfor the price of $116,000. The total cost of the Refuge amounted\r\nto $180,000. The city received from the Gustave Meurling estate,\r\nafter deducting all expenses, $72,429.19, so that the city’s\r\nshare amounts to $107,770.81.\r\n\r\nThe building, although it is simple and without luxury, is quite\r\nsolid and safe. It is entirely fire-proof. In order to reduce to\r\na minimum the cost of maintenance, the inside facing of all the\r\noutside walls and of all the divisions other than those which\r\nare glazed has been made of pressed brick. The foundation walls\r\nare of stone concrete. The floors, which are all of concrete\r\nfinished with cement, have a slight slope, which permits of their\r\nbeing thoroughly washed. A steam and hot water heating system\r\nruns through the whole of the building. The tank is provided with\r\na heater for summer. Improved appliances (among others three\r\nfumigators of the most modern type) have been installed in the\r\nlaundry.\r\n\r\nThe walls have been constructed sufficiently thick to support the\r\nadditional stones which may hereafter be erected. The Meurling\r\nMunicipal Refuge is now, in 1914, in full operation.\r\n\r\nThe following table shows the number of destitute persons who\r\nhave been harboured gratuitously in the police stations and night\r\nrefuges since 1901:\r\n\r\n  1901      55,125\r\n  1902      50,207\r\n  1903      46,685\r\n  1904      61,400\r\n  1905      65,184\r\n  1906      62,228\r\n  1907      59,713\r\n  1908      78,548\r\n  1909      59,097\r\n  1910      58,726\r\n  1911      76,334\r\n  1912      82,731\r\n  1913      90,076\r\n  or 7,345 more than in 1912.\r\n\r\nAs will be seen by these figures, the establishment of a\r\nmunicipal refuge could no longer be delayed. The Meurling\r\ninstitution is undoubtedly of great service to the homeless poor.\r\n\r\nAmong other relief bodies are:\r\n\r\nRefuge de Nuit (Ouimet); Refuge Français, 71 Viger Avenue; Refuge\r\nof the “Union Nationale Française,” founded October 20, 1886, by\r\nM. Victor Ollivon.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               III\r\n\r\n               SICK VISITATION AND NURSING BODIES\r\n\r\n  GREY NUNS--SISTERS OF PROVIDENCE--OTHER BODIES--THE VICTORIAN\r\n                         ORDER OF NURSES\r\n\r\n\r\n                            GREY NUNS\r\n\r\nThe visitation of the sick in their homes has always been one of\r\nthe forms of charity in this city. As a more pronounced movement\r\nthe Grey Nuns took up domiciliary visits on October 23, 1848.\r\nAmong the works of the Grey Nuns for 1863 Jacques Viger, in his\r\n“Servantes de Dieu in Canada,” has the following:\r\n\r\n  Number of the poor helped in their homes        1,418\r\n  Number of house visits                          4,943\r\n  Number of night attendances among the sick        300\r\n\r\n\r\n                      SISTERS OF PROVIDENCE\r\n\r\nThe Sisters of Providence who were engaged in the same work\r\naccording to the Annuaire de Ville Marie of Huguet-Latour, in\r\n1863, were thus active:\r\n\r\n  Number of poor and sick visited in 1863         13,243\r\n  Night attendances                                  622\r\n  Assisted at death                                  136-758\r\n\r\nThus the work was carried on by the early religious communities\r\nand their work is now supplemented by other new congregations,\r\nnotably by the Sœurs del ’Esperance, on Sherbrooke Street, who\r\nmake this work a specialty, and by the Tertiaries (lay) of St.\r\nFrançois, and others. The work has also been carried on by groups\r\nof ladies connected with the Protestant churches and as well by\r\nnursing bodies organized of late years.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the modern organized nursing system, reference has\r\nbeen made to the training of nurses for hospital work. There are\r\nschools attached to each of the great hospitals. There are now,\r\nhowever, several bodies who are trained to work in the homes\r\nof the people, such as the Canadian Order of Nurses, Phillip’s\r\nSchool for Nurses and the Victorian Order of Nurses. The latter\r\nmovement being the latest development and one that has reached\r\nDominion prominence, deserves especial historical recognition.\r\n\r\n\r\n                  THE VICTORIAN ORDER OF NURSES\r\n\r\nThe Victorian Order of Nurses was inaugurated in 1897 as the\r\nMemorial of Queen Victoria’s Jubilee in Canada. The suggestion\r\nthat this should be the Canadian Memorial came from the National\r\nCouncil of Women of Canada, of which Her Excellency, the Countess\r\nof Aberdeen, was then the presidential head. In 1896 the urgent\r\nneed of medical aid and trained nursing in the northwest\r\nterritories and outlying districts of Canada had been brought\r\nhome to the council through its affiliated societies in the\r\nCanadian west. A scheme was thought out and laid before the prime\r\nminister and other members of the government and at a public\r\nmeeting at Ottawa in 1897 a resolution in its favour was moved by\r\nthe Hon. Wilfrid Laurier, seconded by the Hon. Clifford Sifton,\r\nminister of the interior, and carried unanimously.\r\n\r\nAfter consultation with some of the leading doctors, public\r\nmeetings were held in Ottawa, Montreal and Toronto, and\r\nrepresentative committees were formed in these and other cities\r\nfor the promotion of the scheme. On the advice of the friends of\r\nthe movement in Montreal it was decided that only fully trained\r\nhospital nurses, holding a diploma from a recognized hospital\r\nschool, after training in maternity and district work, should be\r\nadmitted into the order. Very strict rules were made forbidding\r\nthe nurses to go to cases where no doctor was in attendance,\r\nplacing the nurse in all cases under the control of the doctor\r\nand limiting the nurse’s attendance on the patient to visits of\r\nshort duration, thus safeguarding the interests of the ordinary\r\nprofessional nurse.\r\n\r\nIt was agreed to administer the order through a central board\r\nand local boards of management who would supervise the nurses’\r\nwork and be responsible for their salaries, board and lodging.\r\nIt was hoped that enough money would be collected for the\r\npermanent endowment of the order for work in all parts of\r\nCanada, but, owing mainly to the strong opposition of the large\r\nmajority of medical men who misunderstood the objects of the\r\norder and pronounced against it, public opinion was adversely\r\naffected and only a tithe of the money required was collected\r\nand that mainly for local purposes. So many new facts, however,\r\nhad been brought to light emphasizing the great need for such\r\na nursing order throughout Canada that it was decided to make\r\na start with the money in hand and four training centres,\r\nnamely, Montreal, Toronto, Ottawa and Halifax, were established\r\nunder district superintendents with a New Brunswick lady, Miss\r\nCharlotte Macleod, of the Waltham Training School, as chief lady\r\nsuperintendent.\r\n\r\nMeantime a constitution and by-laws had been drawn up and an\r\napplication made to Her Majesty for a royal charter for the\r\nnew order, which was duly granted in 1898. By the end of the\r\nfollowing year there were eighteen Victorian Order districts\r\nthroughout the country with thirty nurses. Today in Montreal\r\nalone we have ten districts, with seventy-one Victorian Order\r\nnurses, while in Canada generally there are two hundred and\r\nthirty-two. Cottage hospitals have been started all through the\r\ncountry districts and in addition to these there are small\r\ncentres with two nurses who attend patients scattered over a wide\r\narea and also receive emergency cases at the homes.\r\n\r\nAs the aim and object of the order became better understood the\r\nopposition on the part of the doctors and nurses changed into\r\ncordial sympathy and co-operation and the Victorian Order have\r\nnow no better friends than the medical and nursing professions.\r\nSo happily inaugurated with Lady Aberdeen as its first president,\r\nthe order has always enjoyed the warm support of the successive\r\ngovernors general of Canada and their consorts. Lady Minto’s\r\nexertions secured the money for the Cottage Hospital fund, Lady\r\nGrey raised the necessary funds for the country nursing centres,\r\nand it was owing to the interest and energy of H.R.H., the\r\nDuchess of Connaught, that a large sum of money was collected\r\nlast year for the central fund. The Victorian Order has been\r\nfortunate in attracting to its service devoted women to whose\r\nsingleness of purpose no less than to their highly trained\r\nintelligence must be ascribed its marvellous growth and success.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               IV\r\n\r\n                MOVEMENTS FOR THE “UNFORTUNATES”\r\n\r\n  FALLEN WOMEN--LA MISERICORDE--THE SHELTERING HOME--GIRL\r\n    DELINQUENTS--THE “GOOD SHEPHERD”--THE GIRLS’ COTTAGE INDUSTRIAL\r\n    SCHOOL--BOY DELINQUENTS--ECOLE DE REFORME--SHAWBRIDGE\r\n    BOYS’ FARM--THE JUVENILE COURT--THE CHILDREN’S AID\r\n    SOCIETY--THE MONTREAL SOCIETY FOR THE PROTECTION OF WOMEN AND\r\n    CHILDREN--CANADIAN SOCIETY FOR THE PREVENTION OF CRUELTY TO\r\n    ANIMALS. NOTE: COURT COMMITTALS.\r\n\r\nThe care of fallen women was early tentatively engaged in by\r\nMadame d’Youville before British rule. Doubtless this was also\r\ndesultorily undertaken at a later period by her companions and\r\nother religious communities of women, but it was not specifically\r\nand regularly undertaken as a special work until Madame Jetté\r\nfounded her work which is perpetuated in the Hôpital de la\r\nMiséricorde.\r\n\r\n\r\n                  THE HOPITAL DE LA MISERICORDE\r\n\r\nThe Hôpital La Miséricorde owes its origin to Mgr. Ignace\r\nBourget, to whom so many of the Catholic works of charity and\r\neducation of the city owe their inspiration and encouragement\r\nduring his thirty-six years in the episcopate, from 1840 to 1876.\r\nHis name is written in indelible characters in this city. In\r\nthe year 1845, after having long thought of means of founding\r\nsome establishment for fallen girls he called to his aid a\r\npious widow, Madame Jetté, who had been engaged in much private\r\ncharity in helping unfortunate girls, and invited her to found a\r\ncommunity to perpetuate the good already commenced by her. The\r\nfirst home, opened with one “penitent,” was called the Hospice\r\nSte. Pélagie, a garret reached by a ladder above a dilapidated\r\nwooden building on St. Simon Street, in the tenement now numbered\r\n208 St. George Street. Her family thought her demented and said\r\nthat she was disgracing them, and there were not wanting the\r\ncriticisms and sarcasm of the cynics. Madame Jetté was joined\r\non July 20th by another devoted widow, Madame Raymond, who had\r\nworked towards the founding of the Good Shepherd Institution in\r\nMontreal. A more comfortable building was shortly secured on\r\nWolfe Street (now numbered 207 and 209). More penitents were able\r\nto be received.\r\n\r\nBy 1846 there were five workers and in July, 1846, Bishop Bourget\r\ngave a “rule” to the Congregation de Sainte Pélagie. On April\r\n26, 1847, they moved into another house at the corner of St.\r\nCatherine and St. André Street, today a common restaurant. On\r\nJanuary 16, 1848, the little group of women was erected into\r\na canonical body under the title of “Sœurs de Miséricorde”\r\n(Sisters of Mercy). Madame Jetté, the foundress, became Sister\r\nde la Nativité and Madame Galipeau, Sister St. Jeanne Chantal,\r\nwas appointed superior. In 1848 the number of penitents reached\r\neighty-seven and in 1851 it increased to ninety-seven. During the\r\nfirst six years the institution saved the lives of 390 new born\r\ninfants. In 1851 the community moved to the corner of Campeau and\r\nLagauchetière streets, the site where the present mother house\r\nnow stands. New buildings were ready in October, 1854. By 1862\r\nfurther ground had been purchased to extend to St. Hubert Street.\r\nOn April 5, 1864, the foundress, Mother de la Nativité, died.\r\n\r\nBut the work progressed. At the end of 1872 there were fifty-six\r\nprofessed sister, ten novices, 323 penitents were received and\r\nthere were 230 births in the hospital. In 1876 the west wing was\r\ncompleted. On April 26, 1887, the present maternity hospital,\r\nfronting St. Hubert Street, was dedicated. Up to 1889 the\r\nchildren born in the hospital had been transferred to the Grey\r\nNuns. These Sisters now found themselves in this year unable to\r\naccept the children and the infant asylum in the rear of the\r\nMother House was consequently built and entered into about 1898.\r\nAt present the children born in the hospital are kept there until\r\nthree months old, when they are sent to the country crèche at\r\nSault au Récollet. At this establishment they are taken care of\r\nuntil six years of age, when they are placed, if possible, with\r\nresponsible parties.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       THE SHELTERING HOME\r\n\r\nThe next important development for fallen women was the founding\r\nof the Sheltering Home by Protestants.\r\n\r\nLate in the ’50s, perhaps about 1858, work was instituted in\r\nMontreal by some of the officers of the regiments stationed\r\nhere and by prominent men of the city, for fallen girls, mostly\r\nmaternity cases, one of the leaders of this movement being T.M.\r\nTaylor. This home was called the “Magdalene” and continued for\r\na number of years, disbanding, however, after the regiments\r\nleft Montreal. On the 2d of March, 1868, the home on Seigneurs\r\nStreet, a direct outgrowth of the previous disbanded Magdalene,\r\nwas established for the reception of destitute and fallen girls.\r\nMajor General Russell and Captain Malan were among the principal\r\npromoters and Mrs. T.M. Taylor and T.J. Claxton were trustees.\r\nThis was called the “Female Home Society.” Mr. and Mrs. Taylor\r\nhad general charge of the work, the former being president.\r\n\r\nIn 1878 Miss Barber, who had been closely connected with the\r\nwork, was asked by the matron of the jail to visit a woman who,\r\nin company with her husband, had been imprisoned for theft. Miss\r\nBarber tried to find a home or place of employment for the\r\nwoman, but was not successful, and finally she took her to the\r\n“Female Home” which, though crowded at the time, made a place\r\nfor her. This incident brought to Miss Barber’s notice the need\r\nof a shelter for released prisoners, and at once she began a\r\ndepartment of work in connection with the Home to cover that\r\nneed. In May, 1885, owing to lack of funds, the board of trustees\r\nbelieved it necessary to close the Home, but Miss Barber, knowing\r\nthe value of the work being done, begged for its continuance,\r\nstating that if they would give her the house and one year in\r\nwhich to continue it, she would take full charge and raise the\r\nfunds to carry on the work for that length of time. This was\r\npermitted, and during the year 1885 she was responsible for the\r\nmoney.\r\n\r\nAt the end of that time when a meeting was held and her report\r\ngiven, she stated that the Home was too far from the centre of\r\nthe city, where most of her work lay, and she asked the board\r\nto sell the property on Seigneurs Street and with the money\r\nthus acquired purchase another nearer the centre of the city.\r\nIn 1885 Mrs. Frost became secretary of the Society, with Miss\r\nBarber continuing as its manager. The old property was sold for\r\n$9,000 and after all outstanding debts were paid, there was\r\ngiven over about $800 to Miss Barber and invested $8,000, the\r\ninterest from which was to be used in carrying on the work.\r\nTwo adjoining houses, in order to classify the inmates, were\r\ntaken on Dorchester Street. The advisory board, chosen by Miss\r\nBarber, consisted of Mrs. M.H. Gault, Mrs. A.F. Gault, Mrs.\r\nS. Finley, Mrs. Aiken, Mrs. H. Botterell and Mrs. E. Frost,\r\nsecretary-treasurer. By 1891 it was proved that the Home was in a\r\ngood locality for the furtherance of its work, but as the street\r\nwas to be widened about that time, the buildings were to be sold\r\nand it was again necessary to search for a home. The present\r\nlocation on St. Urbain Street was found and as the house was for\r\nrent Miss Barber called the old original trustees together and,\r\nmaking her report, placed the matter before them. It was decided\r\nto turn over the $8,000 invested to Miss Barber, with which she\r\npurchased the permanent home on St. Urbain Street. The house was\r\nremodelled and work has been carried on ever since.\r\n\r\nThe classes of inmates who are assisted are as follows:\r\n\r\n1. Discharged prisoners and those whom the Recorder wishes to be\r\nplaced in a home rather than imprisoned.\r\n\r\n2. Inebriates, many of whom apply for shelter while others are\r\nplaced by friends.\r\n\r\n3. Girls from the streets and houses of infamy.\r\n\r\n4. Maternity cases, many of whom are more sinned against than\r\nsinning.\r\n\r\n5. What is called the “floating” class--patients discharged from\r\nhospitals before strong enough to work; the weak in body and\r\nmind; incompetent, idle girls, who, not vicious, would, however,\r\nif allowed, sink to the abandoned class.\r\n\r\nThe Sheltering Home was incorporated on the 29th of September,\r\n1898, the incorporators being Mrs. Sarah Hibbard, Mrs. Enoch\r\nFrost, Mrs. John Murray Smith, Mrs. Ebenezer E. Shelton, Mrs.\r\nMatthew Hamilton Gault, Mrs. Robert Ward Shepherd, Mrs. George\r\nB. Burland, Mrs. James Day, Mrs. Joseph Savage, John Dillon,\r\nHerbert B. Ames, Seth P. Leet, Walter Drake, Samuel Finley, Hugh\r\nMcLennan, Albert A. Ayer, Charles Alexander and George Hague.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        GIRL DELINQUENTS\r\n\r\nThe work for girl delinquents was taken up by the Good Shepherd\r\nNuns in 1870.\r\n\r\nThe Community of the Congregation of Our Lady of Charity of\r\nthe Good Shepherd in Montreal is an offshoot of the original\r\nbody founded in Caen, Normandy, in 1641, by Jean Eudes, founder\r\nof the Eudistes Fathers. June 11, 1844, marks the arrival of\r\nthe four first sisters in Montreal from Angers, Mesdames Marie\r\nFisson, Eliza Chaffaux, Alice Ward and Andrews. Their first\r\nhome was on Brock Street in the Quebec suburbs. On July 25th\r\nthey took possession of a fine stone convent of four stories\r\nbuilt on ground given by Madame D. B. Viger. Their work was: (1)\r\nreceive women penitents, (2) Magdalens from the first class, who,\r\nhowever, may never join the order itself, and (3) the education\r\nof young girls. The work of the Magdalens began in 1864 and that\r\nof the preservation of the “penitents” began in 1847.\r\n\r\nThe work of the reformation of young Catholic girl delinquents\r\nwas inaugurated on May 3, 1870, with twenty subjects. These now\r\nare sent by the court or placed by their parents under a useful\r\ntraining in industrial works. In 1893 the industrial school was\r\ntransferred to Laval des Rapids, near Montreal. In addition to\r\nthe above work these Sisters have the direction of the female\r\njail on Fullum Street.\r\n\r\n\r\n              THE GIRLS’ COTTAGE INDUSTRIAL SCHOOL\r\n\r\nA recent effort by Montreal ladies to supply the need for the\r\nspecial treatment of young girl delinquents between the ages\r\nof twelve and sixteen, otherwise than in the Female Jail,\r\nhitherto their only harbour, was crystalized in the opening,\r\nin September, 1911, of a Girls’ “Cottage” Industrial School at\r\nOutremont, which, however, was shortly removed to Front Street,\r\nSt. Lambert’s, in healthy and pleasant surroundings. It was\r\nincorporated by government in 1913. The work is carried on in\r\nconnection with the juvenile court, but it is also open to\r\nfriendless and destitute girls, being supported by voluntary\r\nsubscriptions, and some government assistance. It has been\r\nplaced under government inspection. Very useful lessons have\r\nbeen the outcome of this experiment. It has been shown that most\r\nof those “committed” by the law are the victims of the _moron_\r\ntype of mental defectiveness and retarded intelligence and that\r\nothers are the victims of a carelessly trained childhood and\r\nvicious environment. It has been found that the best method to\r\nrehabilitate these cases is by building up their health and by\r\nconcentrating at present the educational part of their training\r\nupon domestic lines, to make them good housewives and able to\r\nsupport themselves hereafter. The “Cottage” system with its\r\npossibilities of homelike and industrial training is claimed to\r\neffect better cures than the cold and formal methods of the usual\r\ngovernment reformatory. The presidents of the school have been:\r\n1911, Mrs. F.H. Waycott; 1912, Mrs. J. Macnaughton; 1913-14, Miss\r\nBeatrice Hickson.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         BOY DELINQUENTS\r\n\r\nModern reformatory work for boys began in Montreal in 1865. In\r\n1858 a reformatory school for juvenile criminals was established\r\nat Isle aux Noix, near the frontier and at the head of the\r\nRichelieu river. Being an old military post it was again deemed\r\nnecessary to occupy it and the reformatory was removed to St.\r\nVincent de Paul, near Montreal, in 1861. In 1863 there were about\r\nfifty inmates in the institution.\r\n\r\nThe name of M. Berthelet and the Brothers of St. Vincent de Paul\r\nnow became connected with this work. The latter Congregation\r\nwas founded in Belgium, in 1807, by Rev. P. Priest, a Canon of\r\nthe Diocese of Ghent, shortly after the French revolution, to\r\ncare for the sick and poor, the aged and orphans left destitute\r\nthrough the expulsion of the religious orders.\r\n\r\nCanada heard of their eminent services abroad. At the time,\r\nthere was in Montreal a gentleman, named Berthelet, and relief\r\nof the poor seemed to be the goal of his ambition. In fact, M.\r\nBerthelet’s happiness consisted in relieving their wants. He,\r\ntoo, heard of the Brothers’ good work, and he begged Bishop\r\nBourget to invite them out to Canada. They accepted the kind\r\ninvitation and accepted the charge of a home for old people and\r\nneglected children of the city, at the Asile St. Antoine provided\r\nby M. Berthelet on Labelle Street. Four Brothers of Charity of\r\nSt. Vincent de Paul arrived on February 22, 1865, but moved to\r\na larger home on Dorchester Street, opposite the Convent of La\r\nMiséricorde, on May 10, 1865. From there they moved to the new\r\nhome built by M. Berthelet on Mignonne Street, now De Montigny,\r\ntaking possession of it on February 19, 1868. The same work was\r\ncontinued but with doubtful success, till it found its present\r\nvocation as an industrial school, in 1873.\r\n\r\nIn 1870, the Government of the Province of Quebec had founded a\r\nreformatory for youthful delinquents and incorrigible children.\r\nRecognizing that happier results would be obtained, if it was\r\nunder the supervision of a religious body, familiar with the\r\nwork, the Government made overtures to the superior of the\r\nBrothers, but it was only in 1872 that matters were definitely\r\narranged to the satisfaction of both parties. The Brothers\r\nhave been in charge ever since. The reformatory is a blessing\r\nin disguise for many a family and for the community at large.\r\nHundreds of its inmates are today honorable and law-abiding\r\ncitizens with trades in their possession or equipped for a\r\nlivelihood. They would have always been so had their parents or\r\nguardians done their duty by them and given them the example of\r\nan industrious, sober, honest and Christ-like life.\r\n\r\nThe four Brothers have now grown to 150. In addition, since 1874\r\nthey have founded off shoots of their Community in Canada and the\r\nUnited States.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      SHAWBRIDGE BOYS’ FARM\r\n\r\nReformation work for non-Catholic boys is conducted at Shawbridge\r\nin the Laurentian Mountains.\r\n\r\nAs told elsewhere the “Boys’ Farm and Training School” at\r\nShawbridge owes its first active steps to the farm committee of\r\n1906 of the “Corporation of the Boys’ Home,” and its immediate\r\ninception to the board of nine directors of the “Boys’ Farm and\r\nTraining School,” chosen out of the board of fifteen governors of\r\nthe “Boys’ Home” in accordance with the reconstituted amendments\r\ngranted in March, 1909, to the original charter, these amendments\r\nhaving been prepared by Mr. J.S. Buchan, K.C., to provide for\r\nthe twin corporations of the Boys’ Home and the Boys’ Farm, the\r\nlatter, however, being a distinct but subsidiary corporation.\r\nThe first board of directors of the Boys’ Farm were J.R. Dougall,\r\nRev. Dr. Eagan Hill, J.C. Holden, S.M. Baylis, C.S.J. Phillips,\r\nJ.S. Buchan, K.C., F. Hague, F.S. Todd and G.W. Stephens. This\r\nboard elected as their officers the following: President, J.S.\r\nBuchan, K.C.; vice president, S.M. Baylis; honorary secretary,\r\nF. Hague; honorary treasurer, C.S.J. Phillips. Mr. J.R. Dougall\r\nshortly became president on the resignation of Mr. Buchan. The\r\nreformatory is conducted on the cottage system, the prison\r\natmosphere being carefully eliminated, so that it is rather a\r\ncountry farm home school than anything else, although the pupils\r\nare those committed thither by the courts of justice. Everything\r\nat the farm makes for health, virtue and hope, and is a good\r\ndemonstration of the modern view of juvenile reformation.\r\n\r\n\r\n  THE JUVENILE COURT AND THE CHILDREN’S AID SOCIETY OF MONTREAL\r\n\r\nThe Juvenile Court, which of recent years has been established\r\nto treat younger delinquents than those already mentioned, was\r\nlargely the effort of the promotion of the Children’s Aid Society\r\nof Montreal.\r\n\r\nThis association developed out of a movement inaugurated by\r\nthe Montreal Women’s Club, which, in 1905, formed a committee\r\nhaving as its object the establishment of reforms in the methods\r\nthen in use in dealing with the children of the city who had\r\noffended against the law. The members of the club had become\r\nconvinced from personal observation during the course of their\r\ncharitable work that, not only was juvenile crime increasing to\r\nan alarming extent in Montreal, but also that the existing legal\r\nmachinery was very badly adapted to cope with the situation.\r\nThe “Juvenile Court” committee, therefore, began by collecting\r\ninformation regarding the methods in use in children’s courts and\r\nthe probation system in various cities of the American continent\r\nand Europe, and interviewed many public men in Montreal in\r\nthe interests of reform. Of these the first to offer definite\r\nencouragement and assurance of personal support was Judge F.X.\r\nChoquet, who, in an interview with some members of the committee\r\non the 28th February, 1907, expressed his opinion that complete\r\nreformation of the law respecting juvenile offenders was urgently\r\nneeded, and that a juvenile court with a special magistrate and\r\nofficials was over-due in Montreal, in order that children’s\r\ncases might be promptly and efficiently dealt with, the\r\ncircumstances and family history of the cases being investigated\r\nbefore sentence should be pronounced. It was recommended to\r\nthe committee as their first step that a petition should be\r\nframed and sent to the Minister of Justice asking for a new law\r\nregulating the treatment of children’s cases before the courts.\r\n\r\nAnother public official to whom credit must be accorded for\r\nencouragement given in the initial stages of this reform is\r\nGovernor Vallée of the Montreal jail, who stated as the result\r\nof personal experience that the greatest wrong was being done to\r\nthe youth of the city by the system then in vogue; that he was\r\nfamiliar with the juvenile court methods, and heartily in favour\r\nof their introduction in Montreal.\r\n\r\nA petition was prepared and was subsequently sent to the\r\ndifferent branches of the Legislature bearing the signatures of\r\nover five thousand citizens. Public interest was increased in the\r\nmovement by an address given by Mr. W.L. Scott, president of the\r\nChildren’s Aid Society of Ottawa, before the Montreal Women’s\r\nClub, in the autumn of 1907, on juvenile courts and probation\r\nofficers, and as a result of this address the club undertook to\r\ndefray the cost of supporting a probation officer, for a time,\r\nprovided the magistrates would sanction the innovation. Approval\r\nand promise of co-operation having been obtained from Judge\r\nChoquet, Mr. Recorder Weir, and Mr. Recorder Dupuis, a French\r\nlady, Mlle. Maria Clément, was engaged to fill the position.\r\n\r\nIt was now thought that the growth and prospects of the movement\r\nwarranted the formation of a Children’s Aid Society, and the\r\nfirst meeting of ladies and gentlemen to form the executive\r\nboard of such an association was assembled at the residence of\r\nSenator and Mme. Beïque on Sherbrooke Street, February 1, 1908,\r\nwith Judge Eugène Lafontaine in the chair. Although the probation\r\nofficer had only been at work during a few weeks it was stated at\r\nthis meeting that her services had already proved of much value.\r\nJudge Choquet explained the purposes and need of the proposed\r\nsociety, whose officers were elected as follows: President, Judge\r\nF.X. Choquet; vice presidents, Mme. Beïque, Mme. Choquet, Judge\r\nLafontaine, Miss Ferguson, president of the Montreal Women’s\r\nClub, Reverend Dr. Symonds, Mrs. Waycott, Mr. J.M. Wilson;\r\nsecretaries, Mrs. Weller, Dr. St. Jacques; treasurer, Mr. F.\r\nBeïque.\r\n\r\nBy kind permission of the Protestant Board of School\r\nCommissioners, the meetings of the council of the Children’s\r\nAid Society were subsequently held in the board room of the\r\nProtestant High School on Peel Street.\r\n\r\nThe members of the juvenile court committee of the Women’s Club\r\nwere incorporated with the council of the new society, and\r\nsubsequently, until the official organization of the juvenile\r\ncourt, held meetings twice a month with the probation officer at\r\nthe home of Mme. Beïque in order to assist with the probation\r\nwork.\r\n\r\nIn June, 1908, the Juvenile Delinquents Act was passed by the\r\nDominion Parliament, and at the meeting of the Children’s Aid\r\nSociety in September of that year a letter was read from Mr.\r\nW.L. Scott, one of the original framers of the bill, in which\r\nhe stated that, “the success of the Juvenile Delinquents Bill\r\nhas been due in great measure to your Society, and particularly\r\nto your having secured the interest of Senator Beïque and Mr.\r\nBickerdike.”\r\n\r\nThe Society next exerted its effort towards having the act\r\nproclaimed by the Provincial Parliament as a preliminary to\r\nits being put into force in the province. To this end a public\r\nmeeting was arranged, which was addressed by the Chief Justice,\r\nSir Charles Fitzpatrick, and by Mr. J.J. Kelso, the originator of\r\nthe juvenile court system in Toronto.\r\n\r\nDuring the following year the Society continued to co-operate\r\nwith the probation work, and endeavoured to effect regulation of\r\nnewspaper selling on the streets by small children and girls, and\r\nto secure suppression of the deleterious features of the moving\r\npicture shows, which were just beginning to overrun the city.\r\n\r\nIn 1910, the Juvenile Delinquents’ Act was formally proclaimed\r\nby the provincial authorities, and arrangements as to division\r\nof expenses, etc., having been adjusted between the province and\r\nthe municipality, a house at No. 209 Champ de Mars Street, was\r\nacquired and fitted up by the city for use as a detention home,\r\nthe formal opening taking place on the 22d March, 1912.\r\n\r\nIn accordance with the provisions of the Juvenile Delinquents Act\r\ntwo Juvenile Court committees were appointed from the membership\r\nof the Children’s Aid Society, consisting of the following\r\npersons:\r\n\r\nFor the Catholic Juvenile Court Committee:--Madame Beïque, Lady\r\nHingston, Mesdames Crevier, Moreau, Ethier, Miss Quigley, Miss\r\nMurphy, Mlle. Marie Mignault, Rev. Canon Gauthier.\r\n\r\nFor the Protestant Juvenile Court Committee:--Rev. F.R. Griffin,\r\nReverend Doctor Symonds, Messrs. Owen Dawson, K.J. Hollingshead,\r\nLyon Cohen, Maxwell Goldstein, Mesdames F.H. Waycott, H.W.\r\nWeller, W.S. Maxwell.\r\n\r\nThe society sent in a unanimous request to the provincial\r\nauthorities for the appointment of Judge F.X. Choquet as judge\r\nof the Juvenile Court, for Mr. O.C. Dawson as clerk, and for the\r\nretention of acting probation officers, Mlle. Clément, and Mrs.\r\nHenderson, in a permanent capacity, and all of these appointments\r\nwere made, as asked for.\r\n\r\nIn 1912 the Children’s Aid Society cooperated with the executive\r\nof the Child Welfare Exhibit by taking charge of the subsection\r\nof that exhibit dealing with delinquent and dependent children.\r\n\r\n\r\n    MONTREAL SOCIETY FOR THE PROTECTION OF WOMEN AND CHILDREN\r\n\r\nAn association which has done very effective work since 1882\r\namong the sufferers at the hands of the delinquent classes is\r\nthe Montreal Society for the Protection of Women and Children.\r\nIts work is largely preventative and has succeeded in the\r\nprotection of women and children from every kind of wrong, abuse\r\nand cruelty, arising from nonsupport, wife beating, desertion,\r\nassaults, child cruelty and miscellaneous causes. The society\r\nhas steadily pursued the aim of reform regarding prison labour\r\nwages in favour of those who suffer from the incarceration of the\r\ndelinquent husband, the breadwinner.\r\n\r\n\r\n  THE CANADIAN SOCIETY FOR THE PREVENTION OF CRUELTY TO ANIMALS\r\n\r\nThe following movement may be chronicled sufficiently\r\nappropriately here among the charities for unfortunates:\r\n\r\nThe Canadian Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals was\r\nincorporated in 1868, its charter being granted at the request of\r\nThomas Workman, M.P., H.J. Joseph, Henry Bulmer, T.J. Claxton,\r\nE.A. Prentice, H.L. Boulter, J.J.C. Abbott, James Ferrier, Jr.,\r\nR. Mowat, A.M. Foster, T. Mackenzie, George Stephens, James\r\nHutton, G.W. Weaver, Jesse Joseph and others.\r\n\r\nIn 1898 a woman’s auxiliary was formed with Mrs. W.R. Miller as\r\nits first president.\r\n\r\nThe above association was the first in Canada. It is the head\r\noffice of the Province of Quebec, having several branches in\r\nother towns. For the first twenty years progress was slow, but in\r\n1913, as many as six thousand cases came to the association.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        COURT COMMITTALS\r\n\r\nThe statistics for the year 1913 regarding the children committed\r\nto industrial schools by the City of Montreal is as follows:\r\n\r\n    Number of applications                           1,227\r\n\r\n  These applications were accepted or refused as follows:\r\n    Committals accepted                                330\r\n    Committals refused                                 216\r\n    Recommittals accepted                              397\r\n    Recommittals refused                                53\r\n    Committals accepted by the Government                4\r\n    Recommittals accepted by the Government              5\r\n    Applications discontinued                          100\r\n    Applications for release                           126\r\n\r\n  Children in industrial schools[A] on the 31st of December, 1912:\r\n    At the expense of the city                         747\r\n    Half at the expense of the Government               68\r\n                                                     -----\r\n       Total                                           815\r\n  Committed during the year 1913:--\r\n    At the expense of the city                         330\r\n    Half at the expense of the Government                4\r\n\r\n  Recommitted during the year 1913:--\r\n    At the expense of the city                         397\r\n    Half at the expense of the Government                5\r\n                                                     -----\r\n       Total                                           736\r\n                                                     -----\r\n       Grand total                                   1,551\r\n  Released, discharged, etc., during the year 1913:--\r\n    At the expense of the city                         732\r\n    Half at the expense of the Government               13\r\n                                                     -----\r\n       Total                                           745\r\n  In industrial schools on the 31st December, 1913:--\r\n    At the expense of the city                         752\r\n    Half at the expense of the government               54\r\n                                                     -----\r\n       Total                                           806\r\n\r\n  [A] It is now desired to change the charter so that Reformatory\r\n  schools should be renamed Industrial schools and former\r\n  Industrial schools be renamed Trades and Labour schools.\r\n\r\nOf the 806 Montreal children confined in the industrial schools\r\non the 31st of December, 1913, 463 were Catholic boys committed\r\nto the Montfort Orphanage, 422 at the expense of the city and\r\n41 at the joint expense of the city and Government, 290 were\r\nCatholic girls confided to the care of the Good Shepherd Nuns,\r\n277 at the expense of the city and 13 at the joint expense of the\r\ncity and Government, and 53 were Protestant children (33 boys and\r\n20 girls) placed in the Ladies’ Benevolent Institution, Berthelet\r\nStreet, Montreal.\r\n\r\n  Number of boys                                     496\r\n  Number of girls                                    310\r\n\r\nThe expenditure in connection with the maintenance of uncared\r\nfor juveniles amounted to $69,450.15 in 1913, or an increase of\r\n$2,582.49 as compared with 1912.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                V\r\n\r\n             VOCATIONAL TRAINING FOR THE HANDICAPPED\r\n\r\n  DEAF MUTES: BOYS (CLERICS OF ST. VIATEUR)--GIRLS (SISTERS OF\r\n    PROVIDENCE)--THE MACKAY INSTITUTE FOR PROTESTANT DEAF MUTES AND\r\n    BLIND--THE INSTITUT DES AVEUGLES--MONTREAL ASSOCIATION FOR THE\r\n    BLIND--SCHOOL FOR CRIPPLES (CHILDREN’S MEMORIAL HOSPITAL).\r\n\r\nIn a separate chapter we have treated of education only in the\r\nold sense of the term, vocational training as such also being\r\ntreated in the notice on the technical schools of the city. The\r\norigins of that for physically handicapped children, the deaf,\r\nthe blind and the crippled, have now to be recorded. There is\r\nas yet no provision for the mentally handicapped in the city or\r\nprovince though the subject is being at present promoted. This\r\nsection is, therefore, placed here rather than in the educational\r\nchapter since the institutions it deals with are as yet conducted\r\non sociological and volunteer lines rather than as an established\r\npart of the recognized educational systems of the city.\r\n\r\nThere are at present in Canada seven institutions for deaf mutes.\r\n\r\n1. The Catholic Institution of “Sourds Muets,” deaf mutes, boys,\r\nfounded in 1848 and now conducted under the direction of the\r\nClerics of St. Viateur at 1941 St. Dominique Street, Montreal. 2.\r\nThe Catholic Institution of “Sourdes Muettes,” girl deaf mutes,\r\nfounded in 1851 under the direction of the Sisters of Providence,\r\n595 St. Denis Street, Montreal. 3. The Mackay Institute, for\r\ngirls and boys, founded in 1870. 4. The Institution at Halifax,\r\nNova Scotia, founded in 1857. 5. That at Belleville, founded in\r\n1858. 6. Winnipeg, in 1888. 7. St. John, New Brunswick, in 1903.\r\n\r\n\r\n            THE CATHOLIC INSTITUTE FOR DEAF-MUTE BOYS\r\n\r\nMontreal, therefore, might claim at present the lead in this\r\ngreat educational work. Quebec, however, opened a school for deaf\r\nmutes in 1831 under Mr. Macdonald, a lawyer who had studied at\r\nHartford, Connecticut, under the direction of M. Laurent Clerc,\r\na pupil of the Abbé Sicard, who had learnt under the famous\r\nAbbé de l’Epée. In 1817 Laurent Clerc came to Hartford to found\r\nunder M.H. Gallaudet, the first institution for deaf mutes on\r\nthe American continent. The school established by Macdonald\r\nwas unfortunately closed in 1836, owing to the withdrawal of\r\nsubsidy by government. The Abbé Prince, afterwards bishop of St.\r\nHyacinthe, endeavoured to support a school under the direction\r\nof the young Caron, a pupil of Macdonald, but through want of\r\nfunds it closed in 1840. Later the Abbé Lagorce, of St. Charles\r\non the Richelieu, attempted to teach the deaf mutes of his\r\nparish by pictures. In 1848 he was invited by Bishop Bourget to\r\nestablish a school for deaf mutes at Hochelaga, in the hospice\r\nof St. Jérome-Emilien (the old house of the Good Shepherd) on\r\nBrock Street in the Quebec suburbs. He was assisted by a young\r\nman named Reeves, a deaf mute and a pupil of Caron. The school\r\nwas afterwards transferred to a house on Dufresne Street, given\r\nby M. Dufresne. In May, 1850, it was transferred to a building\r\non Coteau St. Louis (Mile End) on a piece of land given by\r\nDr. P. Beaubien. It was closed temporarily in May, 1851, on\r\naccount of a visit made by the Abbé Lagorce to France for the\r\npurpose of study. He returned to Canada in October, 1852, and\r\nwas installed at Joliette. In 1853 he returned to the house at\r\nCoteau St. Louis. There he remained till January, 1856, when he\r\nrelinquished his work in favour of Brother J.M. Young, a cleric\r\nof St. Viateur. The latter, himself a deaf mute, had been invited\r\nby Bishop Bourget on his return from Rome in 1854, when he found\r\nM. Young a professor at the Forestier Institute in Lyons. M.\r\nYoung entered the novitiate of the Clercs de St. Viateur at\r\nVourles on the 15th of October, 1854, and after pronouncing his\r\nvows on October 21, 1855, embarked for Montreal, arriving in\r\nDecember. In view of his advent the classes had not recommenced\r\nin September but were again opened January 7, 1856. After the\r\nvacation of 1856, the establishment was removed to Chambly but,\r\nnot succeeding, it was definitely reinstated in Coteau St. Louis\r\nafter the vacation of 1857. Meanwhile, in 1856 Brother Young was\r\njoined by Father Bélanger. To him are due the many important\r\ndevelopments, such as the opening in 1865 of the first workshops\r\nfor printing, binding and shoemaking. In 1878 he added two\r\nstores to the principal house and in 1881 joined the workshops\r\nto it by a viaduct. In 1870, after a year’s study in Europe, he\r\nintroduced teaching by words and again in 1880 the purely oral\r\nmethod. In 1883 he was forced to take a rest till 1895, but in\r\n1900, he definitely retired, being succeeded by the Rev. Father\r\nCadieux, of the Clerics of St. Viateur. The establishment gives a\r\ncomplete education to the pupils in its vast halls and workshops,\r\nwhere, besides printing, binding and shoemaking, other trades\r\nare taught, such as tailoring, sadlering, joinery, wheelwright’s\r\nwork, painting, blacksmithing, etc. English Catholic children are\r\nalso admitted.\r\n\r\n\r\n             THE CATHOLIC SCHOOL FOR DEAF-MUTE GIRLS\r\n\r\nThe next school, for girl deaf mutes, was established in 1851\r\nat the time when that for boys was in a precarious condition.\r\nIts home was first at Longue Pointe and it was opened, under\r\nthe auspices of Mother Gamelin, the foundress of the Sisters of\r\nProvidence, by Sister Marie de Bonsecours (Albina Gadbois) on\r\nFebruary 19th, with two pupils. The work for the unfortunate\r\nchildren was not then understood in Canada, being even thought\r\nuseless. In 1852 there were four pupils, in 1857, thirty-two.\r\nThe school which had then become too small was transferred to\r\nthe hospice St. Joseph in Montreal. In 1864, the institution was\r\ndefinitely established upon its present site on St. Denis Street.\r\nIts first buildings have been gradually enlarged. The first\r\nteachers studied for a year at Joliette under the Abbé Lagorce.\r\nIn 1853 they went to New York to study under the celebrated Isaac\r\nPeet, director of the Institute for Deaf Mutes in New York.\r\nTwo years later they returned thither for further instruction.\r\nIn 1870 they went to Europe to familiarize themselves in the\r\noral method, but it was not till 1879 that the intuitive pure\r\noral method, replacing signs and imitation, was applied in\r\nits entirety. In this they were greatly assisted by the Abbé\r\nTrepanier, honorary canon of the Cathedral of Montreal, who was\r\nfor eighteen years attached to the institution of the deaf mutes\r\non St. Denis Street. In 1912 the establishment numbered 260 girl\r\npupils and fifty-four religious.\r\n\r\n\r\n THE MACKAY INSTITUTION FOR PROTESTANT DEAF-MUTES AND THE BLIND\r\n\r\nPrior to the establishment of the institution known as the Mackay\r\nInstitution for Protestant Deaf Mutes and the Blind, there was\r\nno school among the Protestant community for the unfortunates\r\nwho might be either blind or deaf. During the year 1868 the\r\nsubject was being agitated and on the 7th of January, 1869, a\r\npublic meeting of those interested in this work was held and the\r\nfollowing prominent citizens formed themselves into a society to\r\nestablish an institution for Protestant deaf mutes and the blind\r\nin the Province of Quebec, then better known as Lower Canada:\r\n\r\nMr. Charles Alexander, Thomas Cramp, Frederick Mackenzie, Thomas\r\nWorkman, John Dougall of the Montreal Witness, William Lunn,\r\nG. Moffatt, J.A. Mathewson, J.H.R. Molson, Hon. J.J.C. Abbott,\r\nEdward Carter, Q.C., P.D. Browne, John Leeming, W.H. Benyon, J.F.\r\nBarnard, S.J. Lyman; and the following ladies:\r\n\r\nMesdames Andrew Allan, R. Redpath, J.W. Dawson, Major, Bond,\r\nCramp, Fleet, Moffatt, Brydges, Brown and Workman.\r\n\r\nThe following officers were elected: Mr. Charles Alexander,\r\npresident; Thomas Cramp, vice president; Frederick Mackenzie,\r\nsecretary-treasurer; Thomas Widd, principal; Mrs. Widd, matron.\r\n\r\nOn the 19th of January, 1869, another meeting was held at\r\nwhich it was announced that the sum of nearly $6,000 had been\r\nsubscribed, and more promised. The members worked vigorously to\r\nraise sufficient funds.\r\n\r\nThe work of the honorable secretary-treasurer was no sinecure.\r\nHe sent out hundreds of circulars to ministers in all parts of\r\nthe province to obtain the names, age, sex and circumstances\r\nof all Protestant deaf mutes in the province. On the 26th of\r\nJanuary, 250 circulars to Protestant ministers had brought only\r\n23 replies, reporting 5 deaf mutes and 5 blind.\r\n\r\nOn the 10th of March, 112 replies had been received, reporting 38\r\ndeaf mutes, 8 of school age, and 34 blind, of whom only 5 were\r\nof school age. On April 30th, 210 replies had been received,\r\nreporting 57 deaf mutes, 35 males and 22 females; eligible for\r\nschool, 8 males and 5 females.\r\n\r\nOn the 4th of May, another meeting of the committee was held\r\nand it was decided that Mr. Widd should look out for a suitable\r\nhouse and grounds to open school for September. A house and ample\r\ngrounds were found in Côte St. Antoine at an annual rental of\r\n$400 with an option to purchase in five years for $8,000. The\r\nhouse contained accommodation for about twenty pupils but very\r\nscant provision for teachers.\r\n\r\nThe doors were opened on the 15th of September, 1870, and 11\r\npupils admitted, 9 boys and 2 girls. Six paid full fees of $90\r\nfor the scholastic year and 5 were free. The number in attendance\r\nwas later increased to 16; 13 boys and 3 girls, one of the latter\r\nbeing deaf, dumb and blind.\r\n\r\nThe institution had a hard struggle for existence for many years,\r\nespecially about 1876, which was a year of great financial\r\ndepression; but with the help of kind friends it was kept open\r\nand attracted the attention of the late Mr. Joseph Mackay, who\r\nfinally bought a piece of ground in Notre Dame de Grâce and\r\nerected thereon a handsome building capable of accommodating\r\nabout eighty pupils and their teachers, and the name was then\r\nchanged to the “Mackay Institution for Protestant Deaf Mutes and\r\nthe Blind.”\r\n\r\nMr. Widd retired from the principalship about 1882 and was\r\nsucceeded by Miss Harriet E. McGann as superintendent, who later\r\nmarried a most talented teacher, Mr. John I. Ashcroft, and after\r\nhis death carried the superintendentship alone to the present\r\ndate.\r\n\r\nThere are now about seventy pupils of whom eleven are in the\r\nblind class. The subjects taught the blind are the ordinary\r\nEnglish branches, music, typewriting, raffia work, knitting,\r\nplain sewing, chair caning and piano tuning. For the deaf the\r\nMasterson method is used in the kindergarten classes, dressmaking\r\nand domestic economy, besides the ordinary public school course.\r\nIn the industrial department the boys acquire a good knowledge\r\nof carpentry, wood carving, cabinet making, shoemaking and chair\r\ncaning.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    THE INSTITUT DES AVEUGLES\r\n\r\nThe “Institut des Aveugles,” or the Institute for the Blind,\r\nat “Nazareth,” St. Catherine Street, the first established\r\nin Canada, was founded in Montreal in 1860 by the Rev. V.B.\r\nRousselot, a Sulpician, who sacrificed his private fortune for\r\nthe work of his predeliction. The course given aims at providing\r\na classical and religious education and follows the practical\r\nmethods adopted in Paris at the Institution National for the\r\nyoung blind. Music is especially cultivated. In 1892 the Grey\r\nSisters, who have charge of the institution, added an Institut\r\nOpthalmique. Eye diseases are also treated at the Hôtel Dieu and\r\nNotre Dame Hospital.\r\n\r\n\r\n             THE MONTREAL ASSOCIATION FOR THE BLIND\r\n\r\nThe latest development is now being enterprised by the\r\nnon-Catholics under the foregoing name.\r\n\r\nIn response to a circular letter sent out by a blind citizen,\r\nMr. P.E. Layton, inviting personal friends and others to meet at\r\nhis residence on Tuesday evening, April 21, 1908, about fifteen\r\nblind men and their friends responded. The meeting having been\r\narranged by Mr. Layton, it was unanimously agreed that he should\r\ntake the chair. In a few well-considered words the chairman set\r\nforth what he considered to be a pressing need in our community,\r\nthe establishment of an association to promote the interests of\r\nthe English-speaking blind in the Province of Quebec. He was\r\nof the opinion that an up-to-date school for the blind was an\r\nurgent necessity and that in connection with this, workshops\r\nfor blind adults should be established so that the non-seeing\r\nmight by instruction and training become self-supporting. In\r\nthe discussion which followed it was unanimously decided that\r\nsuch an association should be formed, having the aforesaid\r\nobjects as its ultimate aim. The officers of the society were\r\nthen elected as follows: Dr. A. Fisher, honorary president; Mr.\r\nC.W. Lindsay, president; Mr. W. Stewart, vice president; Mr.\r\nP.E. Layton, treasurer; and Mr. S. Fraser, secretary. The above\r\nofficers, with the addition of Messrs. H. Baker and T. Stewart,\r\nformed an executive committee of management. At a subsequent\r\nmeeting Messrs. A. Ross and I. Mullhollin were added to this\r\ncommittee. By the end of the first year $12,608.48 had been\r\nrealized from subscriptions.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MONTREAL SCHOOL FOR THE BLIND]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MONTREAL DEAF AND DUMB INSTITUTE]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: NAZARETH ASYLUM FOR THE BLIND]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MACKAY INSTITUTION FOR THE PROTESTANT DEAF-MUTES\r\nAND THE BLIND]\r\n\r\nA library of books in the raised type has been established. A\r\nworkshop for the training of blind adults in broom-making was\r\nopened on December 1, 1908.\r\n\r\nOn June 4, 1910, an act to incorporate “The Montreal Association\r\nfor the Blind” was passed by the provincial legislature. The\r\nprincipal incorporators were Sir Edward Clouston, Baronet; Sir\r\nThomas Shaughnessy, K.C.V.O.; Sir Melbourne Tait; Sir William\r\nMacdonald; Sir Hugh Graham; W.M. Aitken; George Smithers; Charles\r\nW. Lindsay; Philip E. Layton; H.F. Armstrong; E.B. Busteed, K.C.;\r\nSeptimus Fraser, and other persons.\r\n\r\nDuring the next four years Mr. and Mrs. Layton were actively\r\nengaged as treasurer and secretary of the society in collecting\r\nfunds for the erection of a school for the English-speaking blind\r\nand a sum sufficient for the purpose was raised. A piece of land\r\n8½ acres in extent was purchased at Sherbrooke Street, at the\r\ncorner of Notre Dame de Grâce, in 1910, and in 1912 the school\r\nwas built and opened for the admission of pupils in October of\r\nthat year. It was almost entirely furnished by donations of\r\nfriends. The official opening by the Premier of the Province, Sir\r\nLomer Gouin, took place in October, 1913. Thirty-two pupils have\r\nbeen enrolled since that date. Funds have been raised during the\r\npresent year, 1914, for the erection on the school grounds of an\r\nindustrial home for the adult blind, and the building is now in\r\nprogress and will be ready for occupation on March 1, 1915. This\r\nbuilding will accommodate about twenty-five to thirty adults.\r\nVarious trades will be taught and the boarding accommodations\r\nwill be a great boon to the sightless workmen.\r\n\r\n\r\n                     THE SCHOOL FOR CRIPPLES\r\n                 (Children’s Memorial Hospital)\r\n\r\nThe Montreal movement for a school for cripples is of especial\r\nsociological interest as a further instance of the trend of\r\nmodern educational impulse.\r\n\r\nLess than a year after the founding of the Children’s Memorial\r\nHospital, in 1904, the members of the committee of that\r\ninstitution realized the dire ignorance of most of the little\r\npatients who were brought to the hospital for treatment, some\r\nhaving never attended school, others having attended school\r\nduring but short and broken periods of their young lives.\r\n\r\nA school was shortly organized in connection with the hospital\r\nfor the young patients in the temporary quarters, 500 Guy Street.\r\nThe scholars studied reading, writing, spelling, arithmetic,\r\ngrammar and geography; in one or two instances shorthand,\r\ntypewriting and music have been commenced. Some of these pupils\r\ncould sew, knit, crochet embroidery and make bead chains.\r\n\r\nThe aim of the committee of the Children’s Memorial Hospital\r\nafter the removal of the patients in 1909 to the new hospital\r\nhas been to have a separate school building on its grounds on\r\nCedar Avenue, which school would be not only the school for the\r\nresident patients but also the school to which the crippled and\r\ndeformed children of Montreal and the surrounding vicinities\r\nwould be brought every morning in special conveyances, and there\r\nreceive instruction which would fit them to become independent\r\nand useful citizens as they grew to manhood and womanhood. The\r\nchildren would receive their mid-day lunch at the school and\r\nlater in the afternoon be conveyed to their respective homes.\r\n\r\nThe first step taken was in approaching the Protestant School\r\nCommissioners, who gave permission for a collection to be taken\r\nby children in their schools for the School for Cripples.\r\n\r\nThe second step was that of forming a committee and having\r\ncollecting cards printed. After the gracious permission was\r\naccorded by the Protestant School Board of Montreal, and that of\r\nWestmount, upwards of twenty thousand of these collecting cards\r\nwere distributed to the scholars attending the schools under the\r\ncontrol of these respective boards. The school inspectors of the\r\nProvince of Quebec rendered valuable assistance, also supplying\r\nlists with the names of the schools and the teachers under their\r\ninspectorates. These schools were supplied with collecting cards\r\nalso, together with a number of private schools and academies\r\nin Montreal and the surrounding districts. As a result of the\r\nefforts of the school children of the province and the kind\r\nsupervision of the principals and teachers, a very large sum was\r\ncollected.\r\n\r\nThe committee for the organization of the School for Cripples\r\nheld its first meeting in February, 1910. At the last meeting\r\nwhich was held in May, a deputation, composed of the following\r\nmembers of the committee: Mr. C.J. Binmore, Mr. W.D. Lighthall,\r\nHis Honor Mr. Recorder Weir, D.C.L., Doctor Rexford,--was\r\nappointed to attend a meeting of the committee of the Children’s\r\nMemorial Hospital, which was held the week after. At this meeting\r\nthe following report, read by Mr. C.J. Binmore, recommended that\r\nprovision should be made for three distinct divisions of children.\r\n\r\n1. The inmates of the hospital who are able to go from the wards\r\nto the class-rooms.\r\n\r\n2. The pupils who may be brought daily to the school from their\r\nhomes.\r\n\r\n3. The children resident in the hospital who are either\r\ntemporarily or permanently unable to leave their cots.\r\n\r\nThe school has at last, in September, 1914, been completed in the\r\ngrounds of the Children’s Memorial Hospital at the foot of the\r\nhill adjoining Cedar Avenue, and is ready for formal opening. It\r\nwill have two departments, one for the hospital crippled children\r\nand the other for the same unfortunate class from the city. It\r\nwill be taught on the same efficient lines as those employed in\r\nthe city schools. But special vocational training will be added\r\nto equip the handicapped children for the battle of life.\r\n\r\nThe board of management, separate from that of the hospital, is\r\nas follows: President, McKenzie Forbes, M.D.; vice president,\r\nRev. Herbert Symonds, D.D.; Mr. C.J. Binmore, treasurer; Miss\r\nSarah Tyndale, and Mr. W.D. Lighthall, K.C., honorary solicitor.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               VI\r\n\r\n                        IMMIGRATION WORK\r\n\r\n  EARLY ACTIVITIES--YEAR OF CHOLERA--DOMINION AGENCY--THE WOMEN’S\r\n    NATIONAL IMMIGRATION SOCIETY--CATHOLIC IMMIGRATION HOME.\r\n\r\nWriting in 1839 Mr. Newton Bosworth, in “Hochelaga Depicta,”\r\nsays that “the citizens of Montreal are distinguished by one\r\nfeature which is highly honourable to them, standing out as\r\nit does in pleasing and strong relief--and that is a habit\r\nof active benevolence. Perhaps there is no place where in\r\nproportion to the number and wealth of the inhabitants more has\r\nbeen done to relieve the wretched and support the weak by deeds\r\nof real charity than in this city--and this not by thoughtless\r\nand indiscriminate profusion, but in the exercise of cautious\r\nand painstaking administration.” As an illustration of this\r\nfact he quotes, “On the authority of Nathaniel Gould, Esq.,\r\nLondon, a warm and steady friend to Canada, that the Montreal\r\nEmigrant Society during the past year (1832) forwarded to\r\ntheir destination, or otherwise relieved, 10,744 of these poor\r\ncreatures at an expense of £2,126 11s 4d. Too much praise cannot\r\nbe bestowed on the exertions of those pure philanthropists, who\r\nduring a season of much distress and danger gave up their time,\r\nmoney and health to so worthy a purpose.” The last quoted writer\r\nis speaking of the year of the cholera epidemic of 1832.\r\n\r\n\r\n                 THE DOMINION IMMIGRATION AGENCY\r\n\r\nBut immigration from the institutional point of view may be\r\ndated at about 1834, when the national societies, as recorded\r\nelsewhere, arose to safeguard the interests of their own country\r\npeople coming to the city. These societies either had houses such\r\nas the St. Andrew’s Home or St. George’s Home to receive them, or\r\nthey did it by providing them lodging and care otherwise.\r\n\r\nThe Dominion Government has long had its immigration agency in\r\nthe city. Its home is now at 150 St. Antoine Street, where the\r\nnew building with its detention hospital was publicly opened on\r\nMay 1, 1914. Its previous locations were 306 St. Antoine Street,\r\nthe late one, the former residence of a former mayor, C.S.\r\nRodier; then 219 Cathedral Street; before that 183 Common Street;\r\n517 St. James Street; then at a point opposite the Grand Trunk\r\nStation (St. Bonaventure) and at Point St. Charles, etc. The\r\npresent agent, Mr. John Hoolahan, was appointed in 1893 and he\r\nwas preceded by Mr. Daly, father and son.\r\n\r\n\r\n            THE WOMEN’S NATIONAL IMMIGRATION SOCIETY\r\n\r\nAn important philanthropic movement was started in 1882 under\r\nthe title of the Women’s Protective Society, which was changed\r\nsome years later to its present name, “The Women’s National\r\nImmigration Society.” Its first president was Mrs. Gillespie, who\r\nwas succeeded at her death in 1913 by Mrs. H. Vincent Meridith.\r\nAs Montreal is a port of importance, the sociological value of\r\nthe movement is apparent.\r\n\r\nAs Montreal is a port of importance the sociological value of\r\nthis movement is apparent.\r\n\r\nThe home of the society situated at 87 Osborne Street is\r\nrecognized as a government receiving home for the Dominion of\r\nCanada, where all newly arrived women immigrants are given\r\ntwenty-four hours free board and lodging. It has no business\r\nconnection with any employment agency in Great Britain or Canada.\r\n\r\nThe object of the society is the receiving and protecting\r\nof newly arrived immigrant women irrespective of creed or\r\nnationality. Should they remain in Montreal they can board in the\r\nhome at a low charge and assistance is given to them in every way\r\npossible to obtain employment. If they are going further afield\r\nhelp is given them in preparing for their journey and they are\r\nseen safely onto the trains.\r\n\r\nFrom the foundation of the society in 1882 to December, 1913,\r\n11,366 newly arrived immigrants have been registered on the\r\nbooks. In the first two years of the society’s existence those\r\nregistered totaled 459, as compared with the figures for the last\r\ntwo years, 1,697. A comparison of these figures will show how\r\ngreatly the work has increased.\r\n\r\nAn outstanding feature of the work is the receiving and assisting\r\nof large parties of immigrants brought out under the auspices\r\nof the “British Women’s Emigration Society” of London, England.\r\nThese parties traveling under the care of experienced matrons\r\nhave been coming to the home for the past twenty-four years and\r\nhave grown rapidly of late years both in frequency of arrival and\r\nnumbers. At the present time they usually consist of from forty\r\nto fifty persons, though on one day of August, 1912, a party\r\nof over ninety was received and catered for at the home, while\r\nwaiting for trains for different points in the country.\r\n\r\nIndividual passengers are met by request at the steamers and\r\ntrains and assisted with their arrangements for their further\r\njourneys. These form a very large class annually and as they\r\nusually prefer to go forward with as little delay as possible\r\nthey are generally taken direct to the stations and are thus not\r\nincluded in the above totals which only cover those newly arrived\r\nimmigrants registered at the home.\r\n\r\n\r\n                  THE CATHOLIC IMMIGRATION HOME\r\n\r\nA similar work to that of the last named association is now being\r\nperformed by the Catholic Immigration Home at 450 Lagauchetière\r\nStreet.\r\n\r\nOn April 10, 1913, their property was purchased, but numerous\r\nalterations had to be made to make it suitable for immigration\r\nwork.\r\n\r\nThe Home has become very popular with the young women, strangers\r\nin a strange land, who look upon it as their home where they are\r\nwell looked after by a competent matron.\r\n\r\nOn Saturday, June 28, 1913, the Home was officially opened for\r\nthe reception of the immigrants. Among those present were the\r\nfollowing: His Grace the Archbishop of Montreal; Hon. J.J.\r\nGuerin, John Hoolihan, dominion immigration agent; E. Marquette,\r\nprovincial immigration agent; Denis Tansey, M.L. A.; Mr. E.\r\nDufault, deputy minister of colonization, Quebec Government; J.B.\r\nLambkin, dominion agent for the suppression of white slavery;\r\nW.G. Kennedy, president of St. Patrick’s Society; J.L.D. Mason,\r\nM.D.\r\n\r\nRepresentatives of the Home meet the incoming steamers and\r\ntrains, and assist the immigrants, both male and female, arriving\r\nin the city. The young women are protected at the Home, and saved\r\nfrom the evil of white slavery while employment is secured for\r\nthem. It is managed by a board of life governors with a chaplain,\r\nthe Rev. F.J. Singleton of St. Patrick’s Church. It has a matron\r\nand staff for the internal government.\r\n\r\nAmong other immigration activities may be mentioned the National\r\nSocieties, Union Nationale Francaise de Montreal, St. Anthony’s\r\nVilla.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               VII\r\n\r\n                 HUMANITARIAN MOVEMENTS FOR BOYS\r\n\r\n      THE BOYS’ HOME--THE PATRONAGE DE ST. JOSEPH--THE BOY\r\n           SCOUTS--PARKS AND PLAY GROUNDS ASSOCIATION.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         THE BOYS’ HOME.\r\n\r\nAmong the striking developments of humanitarian efforts for boys\r\nthere are several which stand out conspicuously.\r\n\r\nThe Boys’ Home of Montreal is a logical and lineal descendant of\r\nthe “Infant School Association,” which established a schoolhouse\r\non Barre Street in 1868 in connection with Zion Congregational\r\nChurch, Mr. Charles Alexander, James Baylis, J. Dougall, Fred\r\nPerry and others being associated with the work.\r\n\r\nOn the Protestant School Commissioners taking up infant teaching,\r\nas the charter of the above association permitted other\r\ncharitable work, by a resolution of May 5, 1870, in the Mechanics\r\nHall, it was utilized for the promotion of work for waifs and\r\nstrays, and in 1871 the association changed its name to the Boys’\r\nHome of Montreal and established itself in the building erected\r\nby Mr. Charles Alexander, on Mountain Street, known as the\r\nShaftesbury Hall, after the model of the Lord Shaftesbury homes\r\nin England. The work commenced on February 1, 1871, with twelve\r\nboys, to whom were added six others next day. They were street\r\nboys of all religions and each boy paid ten cents for supper,\r\nbed and breakfast. These were a rough lot and it caused Mr. John\r\nRitchie, the first superintendent, some trouble to handle them.\r\nStill the work progressed. Mr. and Mrs. J.R. Dick took charge of\r\nthe boys about 1882 and have continued in this work till today.\r\nThe growth of this home from such humble beginnings is best told\r\nby its buildings. In 1886 the present centre building, costing\r\n$13,000, was built; in 1893 the north building for educational\r\npurposes; and in 1904 the new Alexander wing, costing $30,000,\r\nincluding gymnasium, swimming bath, etc., replaced the old\r\nShaftesbury Hall. The work has overflowed so that the home was\r\ninstrumental in fathering the Shawbridge Boys’ Farm. This had\r\nlong been projected through the efforts of Mr. Alexander, the\r\npresident, who had desired to accomplish some betterment of the\r\nmiserable conditions, officially acknowledged, attaching to the\r\ncare and reform of the Protestant juvenile delinquent in the\r\nSherbrooke reformatory, which was nothing more than a part of\r\nthe Sherbrooke jail. As early as 1902 the matter was brought\r\nbefore the board by Mr. J. R. Dick. In 1906 it was again urged\r\nthat the Boys’ Home board was the right corporation to bring\r\nabout the reform so long required, through the establishment of\r\nan industrial farm, which eventually opened its doors to the\r\nfourteen boys from Sherbrooke Reformatory on March 31, 1909, the\r\ncontract with the government having been concluded on March 8,\r\n1909. The first immediate step, however, was taken in 1906 by the\r\ncorporation of the Boys’ Home through its farm committee under\r\nMr. J.S. Buchan, with Messrs. S.M. Bayliss, Frederick Hague and\r\nC.S.J. Phillipps. In 1907 the Goodfellow Farm of 300 acres and\r\ncattle was purchased at Shawbridge, forty miles from the city\r\non the Nominique Division of the Canadian Pacific Railway. It\r\nhas a station also on the Canadian Northern Quebec Railway, the\r\nfarm being conveniently situated about a mile from the city.\r\nIts grounds were laid out under the direction of Professor\r\nNobbs and Mr. F. Todd, with Mr. Cecil Burgess as the building\r\narchitect. A simple inauguration was held in December, when\r\nthe work was commenced. Mr. G.W. Mathews, late of the Kibble\r\nInstitute, Paisley, Scotland, arrived in March, 1908, to take\r\nthe position of superintendent on May 1st, when the farm came\r\ninto the possession of the corporation. The formal opening of the\r\nBoys’ Farm took place on October 26, 1908. Its subsequent history\r\nbelongs to the section on “Reformation.” The Boys’ Home, which\r\nstill retains its original character, has merited the good will\r\nof the citizens. Since 1868 it has had only two presidents, Mr.\r\nCharles Alexander, who died on November 6, 1905, and Mr. J.E.\r\nDougall, his successor.\r\n\r\n\r\n                     PATRONAGE DE ST. JOSEPH\r\n\r\nAlthough there are numberless forms of charity among the\r\nFrench-speaking population it was not till 1892 that young orphan\r\nboys of the apprentice class were specially catered for, when, on\r\nSeptember 8th, the Patronage de St. Joseph was opened for such\r\nat the southeast corner of Dorchester Street and St. Charles\r\nBorromeo. The idea was conceived by the conference St. Laurent\r\nof the Society of St. Vincent de Paul, under the direction\r\nof its president, M. Sénécal, and its chaplain, the Rev. M.\r\nHébert. Shortly after six months the location was removed by an\r\noffer of land from the Seminary of St. Sulpice to the corner of\r\nLagauchetière and St. George streets. The new dwelling was even\r\nstill too small for the growing number of apprentices and through\r\nthe generous assistance of M. Froidevaux great enlargements were\r\nadded within four months to the first building. Two years later,\r\nin 1895, a third building was commenced, but was not utilized\r\ntill May, 1897, by the act of the Rev. M. Colin, superior of the\r\nSeminary, who has made it possible by furnishing the necessary\r\nfunds.\r\n\r\nThe work has given asylum since its twenty-two years of existence\r\nto more than fifteen hundred young boys learning their trades,\r\neither in the Brothers’ workshops or in the town, returning to\r\nthe Patronage at night. At present ninety apprentices are housed\r\nand only inadequate means prevents more from being served.\r\n\r\nOther activities for boys beyond these two representative\r\ninstitutions are connected with the churches and social works\r\nof the city with numerous clubs for mental, moral and physical\r\nuplift.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         THE BOY SCOUTS\r\n\r\nThe scout movement, founded in England by Lieut.-Gen. Sir Robert\r\nS.S. Baden-Powell, for building boys into strong, virile manhood,\r\nis really organized clubdom for boys, bringing to them physical,\r\nmoral and intellectual training. It was intended at first by the\r\nfounder to be used by existing boys’ organizations, such as the\r\nY.M.C.A., Boys’ Brigade, School and Cadet Corps, but it grew\r\nbeyond those bounds.\r\n\r\nThe first permanent work in connection with the Boy Scout\r\norganization in Montreal was undertaken by Mr. Nigel Young\r\nduring the winter and summer of 1910. On September 2, 1910,\r\nLieut.-Gen. Sir R.S.S. Baden-Powell, the Chief Scout and founder\r\nof the movement, visited Montreal and addressed a meeting of\r\nthe citizens in the arena with the mayor, Doctor Guerin, in the\r\nchair. On the following day he reviewed the troop of the city\r\nand addressed the scoutmasters. The Chief Scout was accompanied\r\nby Lieutenant-Colonel Burland, who had the previous day been\r\nappointed commissioner for the Province of Quebec.\r\n\r\nIn July, 1912, eleven scouts and three scoutmasters were present\r\nat the rally and review held by His Majesty at Windsor during the\r\ncoronation events. The whole Canadian contingent, numbering in\r\nall 136, was commanded by Lieut.-Col. Minden Cole, chairman of\r\nthe Montreal council.\r\n\r\nIn the autumn of 1911 Mr. David Evans was appointed assistant\r\ncommissioner and secretary for the province, since which time two\r\nothers have held that office, Mr. Russell Patterson, in 1912-13,\r\nand Mr. Lordly, in 1914.\r\n\r\nDuring the winter of 1911, through the efforts of the late\r\nLieutenant-Colonel Whitehead, honorary treasurer of the Montreal\r\nScout Council, a tract of land 300 acres in extent, with two fine\r\nlakes, was purchased in the Laurentian Mountains for a permanent\r\ncamping ground for the scouts of the province. This has been\r\nimproved and a new up-to-date men’s hall has been erected. A full\r\nequipment of tents, boats, etc., was supplied to accommodate 175\r\nscouts at one time.\r\n\r\nIn September, 1914, Lieut.-Col. J. Burland resigned the\r\ncommissionership of the province and his place has been taken\r\nby Lieutenant-Colonel Starke, appointed by H.R.H. the Duke of\r\nConnaught, chief scout for Canada.\r\n\r\nAt the present time there are in Montreal 12 local associations,\r\n54 scout troops, 53 scoutmasters, 49 assistant scoutmasters,\r\n1,423 scouts, 23 king scouts, and 3 silver cross scouts.\r\n\r\n\r\n               PARKS AND PLAY GROUNDS ASSOCIATION\r\n\r\nA most important factor in the life of a city is the provision\r\nof open spaces and breathing places for the working classes,\r\nand especially for the children. In the winter of 1895-6 a few\r\nladies founded the Parks’ Protective Association. Its first\r\nexecutive committee was: Mrs. N. Peterson, president; Mrs. Hugh\r\nGraham, Mrs. N.V. Meredith, Mrs. Frank Redpath, Mrs. John Cox,\r\nMrs. Charles Hope, Mrs. F. Walton, Mrs. Kenneth Macpherson, Mrs.\r\nCharles Whitehead and Miss Edith Watt, honorary secretary. In\r\nApril, 1900, its scope was enlarged by a larger association being\r\nformed, with men admitted to committee work, to carry on its\r\nwork under the title of the “Parks and Playgrounds Association.”\r\nA special object of the new association is to promote public\r\nplaygrounds for the children and urge the city authorities to do\r\nthis. The association was incorporated in 1904. Its presidents\r\nhave been: Sir William Hingston, Sir George Drummond and Sir\r\nAlexander Lacoste. It has fostered a growing sentiment in favour\r\nof public playgrounds and in 1913 it had seven of these under\r\nproper supervision. Admirable modern playing apparatus has been\r\ninstalled during the last two years. The movement has public\r\nfavour and the association’s slogan of 1912 for “$1,000,000 for\r\nplaygrounds” as the extent of a grant desired from the city\r\nhall, has had the result of urging the city to purchase a great\r\nquantity of land for definite further playground expansion. The\r\ncity has now also undertaken the care and management of its\r\nown public playground property and the association at present\r\nconfines itself to its own playgrounds at Hibernia Road, and\r\ntwo others. Its record is very creditable as a voluntary public\r\nservice.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              VIII\r\n\r\n                       HEBREW SOCIAL WORKS\r\n\r\nBARON DE HIRSCH INSTITUTE--LADIES’ BENEVOLENT ASSOCIATIONS--OTHER\r\n                           SOCIETIES.\r\n\r\nThe social work of the Hebrew as such may be treated separately\r\nas an indication of social endeavour on racial lines.\r\n\r\nThe philanthropic institutions of the Hebrews of Montreal have\r\nbecome numerous. The most important one is the “Baron de Hirsch\r\nInstitute,” which was founded in 1863 under the name of “The\r\nYoung Men’s Hebrew Benevolent Society.” When afterwards the late\r\nBaron de Hirsch sent them large sums as a fund for assisting in\r\nthe onerous work which had fallen on this society through the\r\nlarge influx of Jews from Eastern Europe in the ’80s they changed\r\nthe name to “Baron de Hirsch Institute and Hebrew Benevolent\r\nSociety.” Among its founders were Lawrence L. Levy, who was its\r\nfirst president, Isidor Ascher, Tucker David, Charles Levy,\r\nLawrence Cohen, M. Gutman, Moise Schwob and S.E. Moss. Among its\r\npresidents have been Jacob L. Samuel, Lyon Silverman, Jacob G.\r\nAscher, Lewis A. Hart, N. Friedman, Harris Vineberg, David A.\r\nAnsell, Mortimer Davis, Lyon Cohen and Samuel W. Jacobs, K.C.\r\nMr. Ansell held office for fourteen years. It was during his\r\nadministration that the large building on Bleury Street, now\r\noccupied by the institute was acquired. He was a very active\r\nworker in the cause of education and his name will always be\r\nespecially identified with that branch of the work of the Baron\r\nde Hirsch Institute. He also was Consul General for Mexico. Each\r\nof the above-mentioned presidents in turn did yeoman service for\r\nthe advancement of the institute, which has grown in importance\r\nfrom year to year.\r\n\r\nThe Ladies’ Hebrew Benevolent Society, founded in 1877, is\r\nthe oldest and most important of the Hebrew women’s charity\r\norganizations. The Hebrew Free Loan Society, which was founded\r\nsome years ago, largely through the efforts of Z. Fineberg,\r\ndoes splendid work in making loans to those requiring aid who\r\nrefuse to take charity and who pay back the loans thus made\r\nas their condition improves. The Herzl Free Dispensary, the\r\nHebrew Sheltering Home, the Hebrew Sick Benefit Association, the\r\nHebrew Young Ladies’ Sewing Society all do noble work in their\r\nseparate branches, and there are a large number of other equally\r\nmeritorious Hebrew organizations doing work in every field of\r\nphilanthropy.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               IX\r\n\r\n                      COOPERATIVE MOVEMENTS\r\n\r\n  WOMEN’S WORK--THE MONTREAL WOMEN’S CLUB--THE LOCAL COUNCIL\r\n    OF WOMEN--LA FEDERATION NATIONALE--THE MONTREAL SUFFRAGE\r\n    ASSOCIATION--THE CITY IMPROVEMENT LEAGUE--THE CITIZENS’\r\n    ASSOCIATION--THE CHILD WELFARE EXHIBITION--ITS LESSONS--THE MILK\r\n    STATION MOVEMENT.\r\n\r\nUp to 1892 charitable and social work was conducted busily and\r\nself-sacrificingly, but often without sufficient inter-relation\r\nbetween the workers of the various institutions and bodies and\r\nchurches. Accordingly the movements for cooperation which now\r\nbegan mark the beginning of a most fruitful epoch. The first\r\nsigns of the new period were manifested by the foundation of the\r\nMontreal Women’s Club in 1892 and that of the local Council of\r\nWomen in 1893, to be followed by La Fédération Nationale in 1907.\r\n\r\nLengthy notices are given of the women’s movements, for\r\nhistorically the period we are now in is peculiarly theirs. It is\r\nalso indirectly a summing up of the very large part played by the\r\nwomen of Montreal in the charitable and humanitarian work of this\r\ncity, as this chapter amply testifies.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    THE MONTREAL WOMEN’S CLUB\r\n\r\nThe Montreal Women’s Club was founded by Mrs. Robert Reid,\r\nDecember 7, 1892--the object of the club being to promote\r\nagreeable and useful relations between women of artistic,\r\nliterary, scientific and philanthropic tastes. The legal\r\nincorporation of this club was secured on April 4, 1893. The\r\nweekly programme, at first used as a means of personal culture,\r\nsoon became an important factor in the life of its members,\r\nrevealing to them abuses to be abolished or reforms to be\r\ninstituted. To-day, like so many modern clubs of women originally\r\nof a literary origin, this club also is trying to assist in\r\nsolving some of the many complex problems which affect childhood\r\nand womanhood, as regards industrial, educational, economic,\r\ncivic and home conditions. The necessities soon arose for\r\nspecialized efforts, hence the formation of the many standing\r\ncommittees, the success of whose work has brought credit to the\r\nclub and much benefit to Montreal, through reforms promoted or\r\nactually initiated through the committees attached to departments\r\nbearing on “Home and Education,” “Social Science” and “Art and\r\nLiterature.”\r\n\r\nThe first Social Science Committee, Medical Inspection of Schools\r\n(1902), laboured for four years, educating public opinion, and\r\ninfluencing other organizations whose consent was necessary\r\nbefore a system of medical inspection could be established.\r\n\r\nThe Hygiene Committee provides educative reports and\r\nrecommendations along civic and natural lines of hygienic\r\nconditions.\r\n\r\nThe Moral and Social Reform Committee (1909) has given educative\r\nreports on the moral problem. This committee has been acquiring\r\ninformation, distributing literature, and through the publicity\r\nof the press seeking to make the public realize conditions as\r\nthey are to-day in Montreal, caused by the influx of foreigners,\r\novercrowding of tenements, poor wages, and lack of compulsory\r\neducation.\r\n\r\nThe Forestry Committee (1908)--now Conservation--shows that the\r\nclub has a national outlook.\r\n\r\nThe Juvenile Court Committee (1904) began its work by directing\r\nthe movement in Montreal to assist in securing the passage of the\r\nDominion Act, which established children’s courts (passed June,\r\n1908). With the financial support of the club, this committee was\r\nthe nucleus of the Children’s Aid Society of Montreal, formed\r\nin February, 1908. Subsequently when the Provincial Legislature\r\nadopted the Dominion Act, the City of Montreal agreed to its\r\nprovisions, and then purchased and furnished the necessary\r\ndetention home.\r\n\r\nThe Child Labour Committee (1906) took a very important part in\r\nthe Child Welfare Exhibit of 1912.\r\n\r\nThe Civics Committee (1906) secured the placing of\r\n“anti-spitting” notices on street corners, and during 1912-1913\r\nworked to secure the abolishment of the smoke nuisance, as well\r\nas for the suppression of noises caused by milk and coal carts,\r\nand by defective car wheels.\r\n\r\nThe efforts of The Industrial Committee (1906) were principally\r\ndirected to the continuance of the work of the Mary Laura\r\nFerguson Girls’ Club.\r\n\r\nThe establishment in the city of a Consumers’ League has been\r\npromoted through this committee.\r\n\r\nIt also organizes lectures on its main subjects of intellectual\r\nand artistic culture. On the social side it has committees of\r\ncourtesy, library and hospitality. In general it cooperates with\r\nall civic movements to make Montreal a better place in which to\r\nlive.\r\n\r\nThe gifts to philanthropic work included grants to the relief\r\nfunds of the Royal Edward Institute and the Victorian Order of\r\nNurses.\r\n\r\nThe club is affiliated with the Local Council of Women, the Civic\r\nImprovement League and the General Federation of Women’s Clubs,\r\nand is represented by delegates to the Parks and Playgrounds\r\nAssociation, and to the Child Welfare Moving Pictures Committee.\r\n\r\nThe club, this year attained its majority and celebrated\r\nthe auspicious occasion by the usual Charter Day luncheon,\r\nentertaining as guests, the distinguished women of the National\r\nCouncil, in convention here. The felicitations and congratulations\r\nreceived, prove that the work, worth and earnest endeavours of\r\nthe club have richly justified its existence.\r\n\r\nThe presidents of the club have been:\r\n\r\n  Mrs. Robert Reid              1892-02\r\n  Miss Eglaugh                  1902-03\r\n  Mrs. F.H. Waycott             1903-06\r\n  Miss Mary Ferguson            1906-09\r\n  Mrs. Alfred Ross Grafton      1909-11\r\n  Mrs. Ninian C. Smillie        1911-13\r\n  Madame Héliodore Fortier      1913--\r\n\r\n\r\n               THE MONTREAL LOCAL COUNCIL OF WOMEN\r\n\r\nThe Local Council of Women was organized as a component part\r\nof the National Council of Women, which was founded by Lady\r\nAberdeen, the wife of the Governor-General of the time. As the\r\naims of the Montreal Local Council of Women are modelled on\r\nthose of the National Council, the following preamble to the\r\nconstitution of the latter will illustrate the spirit of the\r\nlocal phase of the same movement:\r\n\r\n“We, Women of Canada, sincerely believing that the best good of\r\nour homes and nation will be advanced by our own greater unity\r\nof thought, sympathy and purpose, and that an organized movement\r\nof women will best conserve the highest good of the Family and\r\nthe State, do hereby band ourselves together to further the\r\napplication of the Golden Rule to society, custom and law.”\r\n\r\nThe general policy is thus stated:\r\n\r\n“This Council is organized in the interest of no one propaganda,\r\nand has no power over the organizations which constitute it,\r\nbeyond that of suggestion and sympathy; therefore, no Society\r\nvoting to enter this Council shall render itself liable to\r\nbe interfered with in respect to its complete organic unity,\r\nindependence or methods of work, or be committed to any principle\r\nor method of any other Society, or to any act or utterance of\r\nthe Council itself, beyond compliance with the terms of this\r\nConstitution.”\r\n\r\nIn 1893 the Local Council of Women of Montreal was founded on\r\na similar basis in relation to the many separate associations,\r\nwhich, in its turn it should hope to draw together.\r\n\r\nIt is therefore an organization which aims to secure the united\r\naction, of both men and women and all existing organizations\r\nof women, into closer relations through organized effort. Each\r\nsociety entering the Local Council preserves its own independence\r\nin aim or method, and is not committed to any principle or method\r\nof any other society in the council, the object of which is to\r\nserve as a medium of communication and a means of prosecuting any\r\nwork of common interest.\r\n\r\nBelieving, therefore, that the more intimate knowledge of one\r\nanother’s work would result in larger mutual sympathy and greater\r\nunity of thought, and therefore in more effective action,\r\nthe various women’s associations interested in philanthropy,\r\nreligion, education, literature, art and social reform thus\r\nformed a local council, its date of organization being November\r\n30, 1893. Thirty societies united at first, the majority of which\r\nstill adhere. There are now fifty societies affiliated with the\r\nlocal council. The first president was Lady Drummond, who is\r\nstill active in the work of the body. The first board consisted\r\nof the following officers, in addition to the president: Madame\r\nThibaudeau, vice president; ex-officio vice president, president\r\nof all affiliated societies; Miss Fairley, late principal of\r\nTrafalgar Institute, corresponding secretary; Mrs. Clarke Murray,\r\nrecording secretary; Mrs. Carus Wilson, associate secretary; and\r\nMrs. Wurtele, treasurer. Subsequent presidents have been Mrs.\r\nJohn Cox (deceased), Mrs. Bovey, Miss Carrie M. Derick and Dr.\r\nRitchie England, now presiding.\r\n\r\nAmong those who served either on the presidential board or as\r\nofficers for many years after the establishment of the local\r\ncouncil were: Mrs. H.C. Scott, who was early elected secretary\r\nand served for several years; Mrs. William MacNaughton, Mrs.\r\nRobert Reed, Mrs. Learmont, Mrs. John Cox, Mrs. Frank Redpath,\r\nMme. Gérin-LaJoie, Mme. Beïgue, Mme. Dandurand, Mrs. Warwick\r\nChipman and Mrs. John Savage. Mrs. William MacNaughton, Mrs.\r\nPlumptre, Mrs. Walton and Miss Helen Reed served as chairman of\r\nthe presidential board when this body conducted affairs instead\r\nof a president. The following names have also appeared on the\r\nroll of officers during the early years, for long or short terms:\r\nLady Hingston, Mrs. A.D. Durnford, Mrs. E. McNutt, Mrs. F.\r\nMcLennan, Mrs. E. Hanson, Mrs. Gillespie, Mrs. John McDougall,\r\nMiss Galt, Mrs. Hugh Allan, Mrs. Wolferston Thomas, Mrs. J.F.\r\nStevenson, Mrs. DeSola and Mrs. Leo.\r\n\r\nThe present officers are: Dr. Ritchie England, president; Mrs.\r\nWarwick Chipman, Mrs. N.C. Smillie and Mrs. J. Henderson, vice\r\npresidents; Mrs. Walter Lyman, corresponding secretary; Miss\r\nEleanor Tatley, recording secretary; and Mrs. A.K. Fiske,\r\ntreasurer.\r\n\r\nIndividual local members represent the local council of Montreal\r\nin the National Assembly on committees such as laws for the\r\nbetter protection of women and children, the custodial care\r\nof feeble-minded women, work for dependent classes, finance,\r\nimmigration, press, vacation schools and supervised play grounds,\r\nthe equal moral standard and the prevention of traffic in women,\r\non peace and arbitration, on public health, on education,\r\ncovering problems of childhood.\r\n\r\nIt may be mentioned that the National Council was federated to\r\nthe International Council in 1897. The value of this threefold\r\nrelation established by so many women’s societies of Montreal\r\nmakes their work likely to be very universally useful, for many\r\nquestions suggested first at international or national meetings\r\nhave been taken up locally and _vice versa_.\r\n\r\nThe publication of the many phases of the work that the Local\r\nCouncil of Women and the affiliated societies have enterprised\r\nin the civic life of Montreal, especially in the last twenty-one\r\nyears, would fill many pages, but as there is no doubt that\r\nin the story of Montreal the action of women in every sphere\r\nof civic activity has done much for the uplift of the people,\r\ncredit and notice must be given to this very important outlook\r\non Montreal’s growth. Some of the particular activities of the\r\ncouncil, therefore, may be recorded.\r\n\r\nIts patriotic efforts have been of a two-fold nature, racial and\r\nimperial. Work for peace and arbitration was begun in 1894, and\r\nhas continued as part of the work of the National Council. During\r\nthe Boer War it gave aid to the volunteers and their families,\r\nand during the present war of 1914 it has worked in connection\r\nwith the Canadian Patriotic Fund, the Canadian Women’s Fund, the\r\nRed Cross Society and work for unemployed.\r\n\r\nIt has worked to obtain reports, and has recommended local\r\naction, in regard to hygiene, education, labour, laws affecting\r\nwomen and children, the equal moral standard and prevention of\r\ntraffic in women.\r\n\r\nSince 1894 the council has promoted progressive reform in\r\nnursing facilities leading up to the establishment of the\r\nVictorian Order of Nurses. It has engaged actively in the crusade\r\nagainst infantile mortality and that which led to the Pure Milk\r\nLeague, out of which grew the movement for milk stations, which\r\nfinally received subsidies from the city. It engaged in the\r\npreliminary anti-tuberculosis movements which finally ended in\r\nthe establishment of the Royal Edward Institute in 1909, and\r\nsubsequent institutions.\r\n\r\nThe local council has dealt in all matters which affect civic\r\nlife, even in municipal government. It has entered into various\r\ndepartments of civic government, such as public baths, clean\r\nstreets, eradication of the smoke nuisance, inspection of\r\nschools, the civic hospital for contagious diseases, etc.\r\n\r\nOne of the first committees established to obtain the appointment\r\nof women on the school boards was that of the council, but this\r\nplan never reached fruition. Many investigations and petitions\r\nwere made by the council regarding training of teachers, the\r\nfurther extension of domestic science and manual training, school\r\nhours, home lessons, etc., and reports on these subjects were\r\ncarefully made out and submitted. The Home Reading Union was\r\nestablished by the council and for some years was carried on as a\r\npart of this body.\r\n\r\nThe Aberdeen Association, to supply literature to people living\r\nfar from larger centres, had its inception through the council,\r\nwhich has worked efficiently for the promotion of art, music and\r\nliterature. It was instrumental in introducing band concerts in\r\nthe public squares, has succeeded in obtaining public days at\r\nthe Art Gallery, and has cooperated with the Natural History\r\nSociety in matters of hygienic education.\r\n\r\nThe local council has done much to encourage Canadian\r\nhandicrafts, having started through the attempt to help the\r\nDoukhabours. This work then passed from the council’s committee\r\nto the Women’s Art Society, and is now carried on by the Canadian\r\nHandicraft Guild, established for this purpose.\r\n\r\nIn 1896 a committee of the local council began to hold lectures\r\non sex hygiene and advocated the suppression of impure literature,\r\nwhich work they still continue very effectively.\r\n\r\nThe Social Study Club, established between 1898 and 1902, which\r\nled up to the formation of the University Settlement, owes its\r\nexistence to the Local Council, and as early as 1894 the latter\r\nbody was considering the question of industrial education.\r\nInvestigations into industrial conditions were made and reports\r\npresented to the Royal Commission. Laws affecting women and\r\nchildren, and labour conditions, have been promoted so that women\r\nfactory inspectors and the amended shop act were obtained, and\r\nmany other ameliorations for the women workers.\r\n\r\nIt has made careful study of the questions relating to special\r\ntreatment of mentally defective children and the segregation of\r\nfeeble-minded women of child-bearing age, while the matter of\r\nsegregation of male defectives has also been considered.\r\n\r\nThe education of mentally defective children in the province\r\nhas been studied and recommendations given to the provincial\r\ngovernment, while another important matter which it has\r\nendeavoured to promote is compulsory education. Great interest\r\nhas been taken in the recreational and social side of education,\r\nnotably in the supervision of play grounds. At a meeting held\r\nunder the auspices of the local council an outgrowth was the\r\nresolution to form a larger movement which developed from the\r\nalready existing Parks Protective Association into a Parks and\r\nPlaygrounds Association, as the new organization became in name,\r\nhaving the addition of women on its board.\r\n\r\nAmong other social reforms the council has secured the\r\nregistration of births since 1899. Various jail and reformatory\r\nameliorations, such as police matrons and assistance for\r\ndischarged prisoners, have been accomplished, and the movement\r\npromoted which, through the efforts of the Montreal Women’s Club,\r\nled to the formation of the Children’s Aid Society, the chief\r\nresult of which has been the establishment of the Juvenile Court.\r\nThe preliminary agitation which ended in the formation of the\r\nCharity Organization Society was conducted by the local council,\r\nseven members of its executive becoming members of the first\r\nboard of directors of the Charity Organization Society.\r\n\r\nThe cause of temperance has received careful attention from the\r\ncouncil, in conjunction with the Fédération Nationale, so that\r\n70,000 signatures were signed in favour of an amendment to the\r\nlicense law, the suggestion being adopted by Government.\r\n\r\nNotably, since 1910, the local council with the Fédération\r\nNationale and other women’s societies have cooperated with the\r\nCitizens’ Association and other bodies working for municipal\r\nreform. A large proportion of the 8,000 women voters of the city\r\nregistered at the polls, showing the success of the new movement,\r\nwhich has been continued to 1914.\r\n\r\nIn 1912 the Child Welfare Exhibition found the local council from\r\nthe first one of the coordinate cooperating societies organizing\r\nand carrying out the exhibition. In this the women’s societies\r\nof Montreal, French and English, took charge of the sections\r\nrelating to their special aptitudes and previous experience. The\r\ncouncil were represented on the executive and beyond special\r\nwork in the exhibition, undertook the charge of the “Explainers”\r\ncommittee in English and Yiddish.\r\n\r\nIn aid of the combined women’s charities of Montreal the Local\r\nCouncil has cooperated with the Fédération Nationale in holding\r\ntwo successful tag days.\r\n\r\nThe council has also taken interest in the subject of immigration\r\nand suggested useful ameliorations.\r\n\r\nThe latest movement has been the promotion of the movement which\r\nled to the formation of the Montreal Suffrage Exhibition early in\r\nthe same year.\r\n\r\nThe first concrete formation of the movement for women suffrage\r\nthrough the peaceful means of an educational campaign, took\r\nplace on April 24, 1913, when at a meeting in the Stevenson\r\nHall the officers for the Montreal Suffrage Association were\r\nelected as follows: President, Prof. Carrie M. Derick; vice\r\npresidents, Dean Walton, Mrs. C.B. Gordon, Reverend Dr. Symonds;\r\ncorresponding secretary, Mrs. Oliver Smith; recording secretary,\r\nMrs. John Scott; treasurer, Mrs. George Lyman; convenors of\r\ncommittees--legislative, Mr. C.M. Holt, K.C.; press, Mrs. F.\r\nMinden Cole; literature, Mrs. H.W. Weller; with an executive of\r\nMrs. Walter Lyman, Miss Cartwright, Mrs. Alister Mitchell, Doctor\r\nGuthrie, Mrs. Macnaughton, Reverend Mr. Dickie, Mrs. Fenwick\r\nWilliams, Mrs. Hayter Reed and Mrs. Rufus Smith.\r\n\r\nAmong the first to respond to the war call in the last days of\r\nAugust, 1914, was the Local Council of Women, which summoned its\r\nworkers of the affiliated societies from their vacation homes to\r\nform together for the organization of the relief committees taken\r\nup in connection with the general patriotic fund of the Dominion.\r\n\r\n\r\n                     LA FEDERATION NATIONALE\r\n\r\nA second council of French-speaking women has since adopted\r\nsimilar methods for combined action in social work.\r\n\r\nLa Fédération Nationale St. Jean Baptiste is the name which\r\na section of the ladies already connected with the St. Jean\r\nBaptiste Association took in 1907 with the idea of federating a\r\nnumber of existent women associations among the French-Canadians\r\nwhich arose in the winter of 1906-7 to meet various social\r\nproblems peculiarly affecting women. While leaving to each\r\nassociation its own autonomy, a central board of delegates from\r\neach organization was formed with its central office in the\r\nMonument National. The association obtained a special charter\r\nin 1912 (3 George V) with a special seal “Vers La Justice par\r\nla Charité.” It still works, however, in union with the Men’s\r\nAssociation of St. Jean Baptiste. This union has been productive\r\nof great value for the life of the French-Canadian women in\r\nMontreal. It has made them study the principal obstacles to\r\nsocial, moral and intellectual progress in the various classes\r\nand callings in woman’s sphere.\r\n\r\nThe works undertaken by committees from the associations\r\nfederated, such as those of the office employèes, shop workers,\r\ntelephone operators, factory workers, the teachers and others,\r\nare divided into three classes, charitable, economical and\r\neducational. The _charitable_ works are those which had the\r\nrelief and aid of the neighbor as their goal, and thus their\r\ncommittees are engaged on church, hospital and social betterment\r\nbodies. The _economical_ are those which develop the women’s\r\ninterest in bettering their material conditions, while the\r\n_educational_ are those which aim at the uplift and development\r\nof the individual. The movement is sanely progressive. It has\r\neffected many reforms in social conditions; it has attacked the\r\nevil of alcoholism and it has opposed movements destructive\r\nof the home life; while it has fostered all it builds up its\r\nwell-being. In the great Child Welfare Exhibition of Montreal in\r\n1912 it played a conspicuous part. Imitating other modern women’s\r\nmovements it has held its congresses at regular intervals and it\r\nhas gathered around the movement a body of writers and social\r\nexperts well able to be of great value to the development of\r\nFrench-Canadian womanhood. The transactions of its congresses are\r\nprinted, as well as those of its various committees in the annual\r\nreports of the works of the federated association.\r\n\r\nIt has an official organ called “La Bonne Parole,” issued\r\nmonthly, which began in February, 1913. Among its chief writers\r\nis Madame Gérin Lajoie, its editor, and one of the most vigorous\r\norganizers of the fédération acting as its first secretary, with\r\nMadame Beïque as its first president. Madame Gérin Lajoie is now\r\nits president. The administration of the association is conducted\r\nby an executive committee with an inner “bureau de direction.”\r\nThe executive includes the delegates of the various associations\r\nwho elect the board of directors who control the organization.\r\nThe following list of officers published in the report of 1911\r\nmay be reproduced as showing the constitution and personnel of\r\nthis modern woman’s movement:\r\n\r\n    _Déléguées des œuvres fédérées_:\r\n\r\n  _Dames patronnesses de l’Hôpital Notre-Dame_: Mme Fitzpatrick,\r\n    Mme D. Rolland.\r\n  _Dames patronnesses des Sourdes Muettes_: Mme Globensky, Mme O.\r\n    Rolland.\r\n  _Dames patronnesses de la Crêche de la Miséricorde_: Mme J.L.\r\n    Archambault, Mme Hénault.\r\n  _Dames patronnesses de Nazareth_: Mme Vaillancourt, Mme L.D.\r\n    Mignault.\r\n  _Dames patronnesses de l’Hôpital Ste-Justine_: Mme L. de G.\r\n    Beaubien, Mlle Rolland.\r\n  _Dames de charité de l’Hospice St.-Vincent de Paul_: Mlle\r\n    Renauld, Mme Giroux.\r\n  _Dames de l’Assistance Publique_: Mme Tessier, Mme Lamoureux.\r\n  _Le Foyer_: Mlle Bonneville, Mlle Frappier.\r\n  _Association des Institutrices_: Mlle Bibaud, Mlle Bélanger.\r\n  _Patronage d’Youville_: Mlle Auclair, Mlle Vaillancourt.\r\n  _Section française, société Aberdeen_: Mme Terroux, Mlle\r\n    Desjardins.\r\n  _Association des Employées de manufacture_: Mlle Robert, Mlle\r\n    Vauthier.\r\n  _Ass. des Employées de magasins_: Mlle Marin, Mlle Simoneau.\r\n  _Ass. des Employées de Bureau_: Mlle Joubert, Mlle Godbout.\r\n  _Ass. des Employées de téléphone_: Mlle Longtin, Mlle Meunier.\r\n  _Cercle des demoiselles de St. Pierre_: Mlle L. Bélanger, Mlle N.\r\n    Paquette.\r\n  _Les écoles ménagères_: Mme Mackay, Mlle Anctil.\r\n  _Association Artistique_: Mlle Idola St-Jean, Mme Baril.\r\n  _Cercle Notre-Dame_: Mlle M. Gérin-Lajoie, Mlle LeMoyne.\r\n  _Cour de l’Immaculée Conception_: Mme H. Papineau, Mme Lacombe.\r\n  _Les Aides Ménagères_: Mlle Leblanc, Mme Brossard.\r\n\r\n\r\n                   THE CITY IMPROVEMENT LEAGUE\r\n\r\nWe have recorded movements of concentrated efforts through the\r\ncooperation of women associations; the year 1909 saw similar\r\nefforts mostly by men, viz., the organization of the City\r\nImprovement League and the Citizens’ Association. Both arose\r\nthrough dissatisfaction among the citizens with the municipal\r\ngovernment, the former endeavouring to assist in promoting better\r\nhygienic, æsthetic and civic progress.\r\n\r\nThe City Improvement League of Montreal was founded on March\r\n9, 1909, at a meeting held in the medico-chirurgical rooms.\r\nIt grew directly out of the success of the anti-tuberculosis\r\ncrusade held in the city shortly before, and its object, in the\r\nwords of its original constitution, was “to unite the efforts\r\nof all who are trying to improve and to cultivate the spirit of\r\nright citizenship in order to make Montreal clean, healthful and\r\nbeautiful.”\r\n\r\nThe league was designed to effect this, by becoming a central\r\nclearing house and bureau of intercommunication for existing\r\ncity betterment societies, or for individual citizens anxious to\r\nassist the city, so that by economizing energy, time, money, by\r\nfederation, by surveying the whole field of municipal activities,\r\nby the prevention of overlapping and by filling up of gaps and\r\nby judicious dovetailing of effort, a central and solid unifying\r\norganization might be found to put the force of all the societies\r\nbehind any particular one or individual cause, and thus to make\r\nthe strongest possible appeal when needed to the authorities and\r\nto public opinion.\r\n\r\nThe league was formally inaugurated at the Board of Trade\r\nassembly rooms on April 12th, being presided over by His\r\nExcellency the Governor-General.\r\n\r\nThe audience and the speakers were widely representative of\r\ncosmopolitan city life. All present hailed the new movement as\r\nlikely to be of permanent value in uplifting the city which had\r\nlong been suffering from a lowness of civic probity in high\r\nplaces, consequent upon a supine apathy and neglect of civic\r\npride in the people generally, so that many scandals flourished\r\nopenly unchallenged and unchecked.\r\n\r\nThe league seemed to provide the antidote for the hour by an\r\nappeal for the increased cultivation of an enlightened civic\r\nconsciousness of responsibility in the citizens, and met with an\r\nimmediate and warm welcome, notably in the press.\r\n\r\nThe league has since promoted and carried out useful reforms.\r\nIts especial successes have been the establishment of the\r\nMetropolitan Parks Commission, and the initiation and the call of\r\nthe Child Welfare Exhibition, which came from the league, which,\r\non January 27, 1910, discussed the matter, at the suggestion of\r\nMrs. J.B. Learmont, and by resolution encouraged the secretary to\r\nproceed to New York to visit the first Child Welfare Exhibition\r\nthen being held there, and to report concerning the possibility\r\nof some adaptable form for the conditions in Montreal. On\r\nFebruary 17th, on a favorable demonstration of its feasibility,\r\nthe secretary was thereupon empowered to call a meeting of the\r\nbetterment associations for the city. On May 24th a meeting of\r\ndelegates of sixty societies approved the holding of a Child\r\nWelfare Exhibition in the course of 1912. A joint meeting was\r\nheld on April 25th of English and French-speaking organizations,\r\ncalled in the rooms of the St. Jean Baptiste Association, when\r\nDr. J.G. Adami, Mr. Olivar Asselin and Dr. W.H. Atherton were\r\nappointed to draw up a scheme to suit the English and French\r\ncommunities of Montreal. This was placed before the latter on May\r\n16th in the Monument Nationale. The scheme was adopted and the\r\npatrons, honorary presidents and vice presidents and the active\r\nexecutive board were elected.\r\n\r\nFinally the Child Welfare Exhibition was carried out in October,\r\n1912, by the special cooperation of coordinate associations of\r\nwomen, notably those of the Local Council of Women, La Fédération\r\nNationale and the many associations affiliated with each of these.\r\n\r\nThe League has led the van in the city planning and better\r\nhousing movements for the working classes and as an offshoot the\r\nGreater Montreal City Planning and Housing Association arose\r\nin 1912 to further promote these desired reforms. It initiated\r\nthe City Cleaning Day adopted by the municipality in 1911 and\r\n1912 and with the Montreal Publicity Association organized\r\nthe larger “Clean-up Week” of 1913. The league has cooperated\r\nwith many business, national, civic and women’s societies for\r\nmunicipal reform and general city progress, and has largely\r\nhelped to develop the sense of combined citizenship in common\r\ncauses throughout the various sections of the cosmopolitan city\r\nof today, and to foster a common civic pride. The league has had\r\na wide outlook and has worked for a league of city improvement\r\nassociations of Canada. At the International City Planning\r\nCongress, held in Toronto in 1914, it advocated the establishment\r\nof a Dominion town planning and housing bureau, which has already\r\nbeen partially established. Among its officers have been, since\r\n1909: President, J. G, Adami, M.D., D. Sc.; vice presidents,\r\nMrs. J.B. Learmont, Madame Archer, Madame Beïque, Prof. Leigh\r\nR. Gregor, Hon. J.J. Guerin, M.D., Messrs. U.H. Dandurand, J.V.\r\nDesaulniers, Farquhar Robertson; honorary secretaries, Prof. J.A.\r\nDale, M.A., Messrs. Olivar Asselin, A. Lesage, M.D., J.U. Emard,\r\nK.C., C.H. Gould; honorary treasurers, Farquhar Robertson, J.F.\r\nBoulais, N.P., and the executive secretary, W.H. Atherton, Ph. D.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    THE CITIZENS’ ASSOCIATION\r\n\r\nThe “Citizens’ Association,” which was organized in 1909 by the\r\nbest and most representative citizens of Montreal, was a sequent\r\nof the various other associations then either existent, moribund\r\nor actually dead, among business men in the past whose aims were\r\nto seek charter reform for better municipal government. It arose\r\nout of the dissatisfactory state of municipal politics at this\r\ndate.\r\n\r\nIts lines are along those of civic vigilance and it aims at\r\nthe suppression of attempts at corruption or malversation at\r\nthe city hall by watching the conduct of those responsible and\r\nby seeing to it that future candidates coming up for municipal\r\nelection should be honest and respected citizens. Its earliest\r\nwork was the promotion of the amended charter which established\r\nthe Board of Control system and of securing a “clean slate” at\r\nthe election of 1910, as already told. It has also promoted\r\nreforms for the better regulation of public utilities and for\r\nbetter city management and administrative progress. It has\r\nendeavoured to act as a clearing house for other associations\r\nhaving a civic political tendency. In 1913, it sought to promote\r\na simplification of the ward system and at the beginning of 1914\r\nto secure a good representative slate in the municipal elections,\r\nbut without the dramatic success of 1910. The career of such an\r\norganization is necessarily chequered, but good men stand by\r\norganized effort for the public good. While its activities should\r\nprimarily be placed in the constitutional or municipal sections\r\nof this history, yet as sociological progress depends so much on\r\ngood municipal government, it deserves record here as an adjunct\r\nof the bodies enumerated.\r\n\r\nOne gratifying aspect of the movements of late years has been the\r\ngrowth of the spirit of civic cooperation through the central\r\nrepresentative associations of a now complex city life.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    CHILD WELFARE EXHIBITION\r\n\r\nReferences have been made to the great Child Welfare Exhibition\r\nof 1912. This took place in the Drill Hall on Craig Street,\r\nopposite the Champ de Mars, on October 8th and lasted for a\r\nfortnight. It was the work of all the social workers acting for\r\ntheir institutions of every class--national or religious--in the\r\ncity. The movement arose out of a desire to combat, by a dramatic\r\nobject lesson, the evils of infantile mortality, then becoming\r\nto be realized more and more in an ever-growing and congested\r\ncity. But the welfare of the older child or the young person\r\nunder tutelage was also illustrated by charts and lectures and\r\nliving demonstrations of what was being done along progressive\r\neducational lines at home as well as abroad. It was practically\r\nan exhibition of modern social endeavour centering around the\r\nhome of the children, in their city environment. While it was\r\nmodelled on a similar exhibition in New York in 1910, it had a\r\npeculiar Montreal aspect, as it was conducted largely on local\r\nlines and embraced the phases of local endeavour. It had lessons,\r\nhowever, for the Dominion, in bringing to the attention the need\r\nof regard for human conservation as well as that of our forest\r\nand animal resources. The municipal, provincial and federal\r\ngovernments by gifts of $5,000 each, assisted local subscribers\r\nin the organization of the exhibition so that it was able to be\r\nthrown open to the public for a fortnight free of charge, with\r\nthe result that as a public educative movement it surpassed\r\nanything previously attempted, at least, in Canada. Thousands\r\nof parents crowded the immense hall and annexes daily, as well\r\nas large numbers of civic officials, teachers, medical and\r\nprofessional men, clergymen and religious men and women in their\r\nhabits. It has been the most notable public exhibition in the\r\nhistory of the city and was marked by the spirit of universal\r\ncooperation in a degree very gratifying to the promoters.\r\n\r\nThe exhibition paved the way to the immediate success of many\r\nforward movements already existing, notably those for better\r\nlibrary and playground accommodations for the city, and the\r\nestablishment of milk stations or gouttes de lait. As this latter\r\nwas among the primary by-products of the main thesis of the\r\nexhibition which sought to lessen the dangers of infantile life,\r\nproductive of infantile mortality, this may be now specially\r\nnoticed. In 1913, from May 11th to the 13th, there was held the\r\nfirst convention of the French “Gouttes de lait,” which outlined\r\nhygienic ameliorations through organized educational campaigns\r\nthat will be of great future value to the virility of our\r\npeople. Similar movements were initiated or continued among the\r\nEnglish-speaking sections.\r\n\r\nTo mark its approbation of the movement the municipal authorities\r\nlargely came to the rescue by subsidizing the efforts of the\r\nsocial organizations of the city.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      MILK STATION MOVEMENT\r\n\r\nThe following table of results obtained at\r\neach (subsidized) milk depot in 1913 may fitly sum up this notice:\r\n\r\n                                                   Average     Consulta-\r\n     Milk Depots                Infants   Deaths  death rate     tions\r\n\r\n  M.L.C. of Women                 466        10       2%         3,222\r\n  St. Peter Parish                230        11       5%           252\r\n  St. Joseph Parish               204        11       5%         2,041\r\n  Mothers’ Clinic                 161         4       3%        13,320\r\n  St. Arsène Parish               153        18      12%         1,440\r\n  St Cunégonde Parish             150         5       3%           480\r\n  St. Justine Hospital            147         8       5%         5,816\r\n  St. Henry St. Zotique Parishes  146        12       8%           285\r\n  St. Enfant-Jésus Parish         123         8       6½%          539\r\n  St. Brigide Parish              112        12      10%           481\r\n  St. Edouard Parish              109         4       4%           608\r\n  Iverley Settlement              102         9       9%           462\r\n  St. Clothilde Parish             85         8       9%           166\r\n  St. Jean-Baptiste Parish         80         8      10%           452\r\n  Mtl.

Father” Osgoode, a\r\nrepresentative of the American Seamen’s Friends’ Society, who had\r\nassociated with him, among others, Mr. J.A. Mathewson and Mr.\r\nJ.T. Dutton, started the work in a little building called “The\r\nBethel,” situated at the entrance to the canal at the foot of\r\nMcGill Street.\r\n\r\nFather Osgoode dying in 1850, the work was continued by the\r\nRev. Samuel Massey and the Y.M.C.A., until in 1862 the Montreal\r\nSailors’ Institute was organized with Mr. Hugh Allan as\r\npresident. Among the founders were Messrs. J.P. Clarke, P.S.\r\nRoss, Charles Alexander, John Ritchie and others. Rooms were\r\nengaged on McGill Street and Mr. David Linton was installed as\r\nsuperintendent. These rooms served the purposes of the institute\r\nonly for a few years when larger premises were secured on St.\r\nPaul Street, where the institute was housed until 1875.\r\n\r\nIn 1869 the Montreal Sailors’ Institute was incorporated by\r\nspecial act of the Quebec Legislature, with the following\r\nofficers: President, Mr. Andrew Allan; vice presidents, Messrs.\r\nGeorge Moffatt and John McLennan; treasurer, Mr. John Rankin;\r\nsecretary, Mr. P.S. Ross; and a board of management of twenty\r\ngentlemen, prominent in shipping circles.\r\n\r\nThe rooms on McGill Street having been outgrown, in 1875 the two\r\nupper flats of Boyer’s Block, corner of Commissioners Street and\r\nCustom House Square, were rented and Mr. John Ritchie engaged as\r\nmanager.\r\n\r\nUpon the death of Mr. Ritchie in 1888, Mr. J. Ritchie Bell was\r\nappointed manager. The need of a building suitably situated\r\nand specially adapted for the purposes of the work had been\r\nconstantly kept in mind from the beginning and many attempts\r\nhad been made to secure such. In 1897 this was accomplished.\r\nThe institute purchased the “Montreal House” an hotel which had\r\nbeen famous in the early days. This was rebuilt and in May,\r\n1898, the institute moved into its own home. Continued growth\r\nof the shipping of the port made it necessary to enlarge the\r\npremises. This was done in 1907 when the adjoining property\r\nwas purchased and the accommodation doubled, so that today the\r\nSailors’ Institute has a building in which to carry on its work,\r\nconveniently situated on the water front, with an equipment which\r\ncompares favourably with that of most of the great seaports of\r\nthe world.\r\n\r\n\r\n                   THE CATHOLIC SAILORS’ CLUB\r\n\r\nThe second activity for seamen is that carried on by the Catholic\r\nSailors’ Club at 51 Common Street, a large building at the corner\r\nof St. Peter and Common streets. Its first home was in a humble\r\ngarret at 300 St. Paul Street, close to the wharf. Its inception\r\nin 1893 was due to a Men’s Catholic Truth Society, formed by the\r\nRev. E.J. Devine, S.J., in 1892. These, notably a Mr. J.J. Walsh,\r\nMr. J.A. Feeley and Mr. H.C. Codd, approached Lady Hingston\r\nand Miss A.T. Sadlier and a joint association of ladies and\r\ngentlemen resulted for work for Catholic seamen. Lady Hingston\r\nbecame from the first the president of the ladies’ committee. In\r\n1897 the Catholic Truth Society board had retired and the annual\r\nreport gives the following officers for the club: President,\r\nLady Hingston; vice president, Mrs. F.B. McNamee; second vice\r\npresident, Mr. J.P.B. Casgrain; secretary-treasurer, Mrs. S.R.\r\nThomson. In 1896, the present building was purchased and the\r\nmortgage paid in 1913. In 1900, the club was incorporated and two\r\nboards were again instituted, the ladies board, continuing with\r\nLady Hingston as president till today, and Mr. F.B. McNamee as\r\npresident of the general board.\r\n\r\nThe presidents have been as follows:\r\n\r\n  1900      Mr. F.B. McNamee\r\n  1901      Mr. Patrick Wright\r\n  1902      Mr. F.B. McNamee\r\n  1907      Mr. Felix Casey\r\n  1909      Mr. Charles F. Smith\r\n  1911      Commander J.T. Walsh, R.N.R.\r\n\r\nIn 1908, Mr. W.H. Atherton, Ph. D., entered into the life of the\r\nclub as its first manager. The chaplains of the club have been\r\ndistinguished Jesuits, among whom the present one, the Rev. E.J.\r\nDevine, has served three terms of varying lengths.\r\n\r\nThe club has had among its advisory board many prominent Catholic\r\ncitizens and of the board of life governors, besides those\r\nmentioned, there are several who have been with the club from the\r\ninception, including the honorary treasurer, Mr. Bernard McNally;\r\nthe honorary secretary, Mr. Arthur Phelan; Dr. F.J. Hackett, vice\r\npresident, and the following ladies actively interested in the\r\ninternal management: Lady Hingston, Mrs. Robert Archer, Mrs. J.B.\r\nCasgrain, Mrs. J. Cochrane, Miss K. Coleman, Mrs. P.S. Doyle,\r\nMrs. Charles F. Smith, Mrs. F.B. McNamee, Miss L. O’Connell, Mrs.\r\nW.J. Tabb, Mrs. S.R. Thomson, and Mrs. J.T. Walsh.\r\n\r\n\r\n                   THE SOLDIERS’ WIVES’ LEAGUE\r\n\r\nOn the outbreak of the Boer War in 1899, Lady Hutton founded the\r\nfirst branch of the Soldiers’ Wives’ League in Montreal, assisted\r\nby a small group of Montreal women. So urgent was the need of\r\nsuch an organization that it rapidly spread throughout all the\r\nmilitary districts in Canada.\r\n\r\nThe aim of the league as defined in the constitution is “to bring\r\nthe wives and relatives of all soldiers, whether of officers,\r\nnon-commissioned officers or men of the staff, permanent corps\r\nand active militia of Canada, into closer touch and sympathy with\r\none another so that whether in sickness or in health they may be\r\nable mutually to aid and assist one another and their families in\r\ntimes of difficulty, trouble or distress.”\r\n\r\nIt will readily be seen that at the present time there is\r\npressing need for the active work of the league. The military\r\nauthorities at Ottawa have always recognized the standing of the\r\nSoldiers’ Wives’ League. At the time of the Boer War the funds\r\nraised for the soldiers’ families were distributed in Montreal\r\nthrough the league by voluntary workers to the satisfaction of\r\nall concerned. At the military conference in Ottawa two years\r\nago, the Montreal league was invited to send representatives.\r\n\r\nIn 1914, the league is repeating its useful services.\r\n\r\nThe present officers of the league are: Honorary president, Mrs.\r\nDenison; president, Mrs. Busteed; recording secretary, Mrs.\r\nWoodburn; corresponding secretary, Mrs. Minden Cole; treasurer,\r\nMme. Ostell. Executives: Mrs. J.G. Ross, Mrs. Gibsone, Mrs.\r\nFages, Mrs. Stewart, Mrs. Anderson, Mme. LeDuc, Mrs. Molson\r\nCrawford, Mrs. Gunn, Mrs. Carson, Mrs. Cooper, Mrs. Sadler, Mrs.\r\nBridges, Mrs. Lacey Johnson, Mrs. Creelman, Mme. Labelle, Mme.\r\ndes Trois Maisons, and Mrs. Kippen.\r\n\r\nThere is also a Westmount branch of the League.\r\n\r\n\r\n                   THE DAUGHTERS OF THE EMPIRE\r\n\r\nThe Daughters of the Empire and the Children of the Empire, a\r\njunior branch, was formed in Montreal February 10, 1900, by\r\nMrs. Clark Murray, with the motto “Pro regina et patria.” Its\r\nobject was to stimulate and give expression to the sentiment of\r\npatriotism which bound the women of the Empire around the throne\r\nand person of their gracious and beloved sovereign. It was also\r\nto provide an efficient organization by which prompt and united\r\naction might be taken by the women of the Empire when such action\r\nwas deemed necessary. It was promoted vigorously in Australia,\r\nSouth Africa, India, England and Scotland, and is now all over\r\nCanada as a great activity of chapter work. The movement is very\r\nwarm in Canada. Toronto has become the head office. A journal\r\nentitled “Echoes” chronicles the doings of the chapters. There is\r\na municipal chapter for each large town and a provincial chapter\r\nin the capital of each province, and individual chapters adopt\r\npatriotic names chosen from events in the history of the Empire.\r\nImperial education in the schools, stimulated by prizes given\r\nfor essays on imperial subjects, is one form of carrying out the\r\nobject of this association. The occasion of the present war is\r\njust one of those special emergencies foreseen for the activity\r\nof the chapters of the Daughters of the Empire and they are\r\nbusily engaged in all the charitable works required in connection\r\nwith the patriotic movement for the welfare of the soldiers and\r\ntheir families.\r\n\r\n\r\n THE “LAST POST” IMPERIAL NAVAL AND MILITARY CONTINGENCY FUND\r\n\r\nIn 1909, an association, sadly unique in the British Empire, was\r\nfounded in Montreal under the name of the “Last Post” Imperial\r\nNaval and Military Contingency Fund under the viceregal patronage\r\nof Earl Grey. Its main object is to give honorable burial to any\r\nsoldier or sailor who has served under the colours in the regular\r\nor auxiliary forces and has fallen into destitution in the\r\nProvince of Quebec. It is also empowered to extend its operations\r\nto other parts. It is a voluntary association unsupported as yet\r\nby an Imperial grant or patriotic fund. When the association\r\nwas formed, it received letters of commendation from the\r\nchief military authorities of the Empire, who were deeply in\r\nsympathy with the patriotic movement, which is an obvious need\r\nas a tribute of gratitude to the Empire’s defenders and at the\r\nsame time they expressed surprise that it has been overlooked\r\nin the economy of the Imperial services. The first trustees of\r\nthe fund were: Brig.-Gen. L. Buchan, C.V.O., C.M.G.; Commander\r\nJ.T. Walsh, R.N.R., and the Rev. Canon Almond, who was also the\r\nfirst chairman. The first treasurer was Mr. Lucien C. Vallée and\r\nMr. Arthur H.D. Hair, its secretary, was the original promoter.\r\nAmong its vice presidents have been Col. C.E. Paterson and W.H.\r\nAtherton. Since its inception men who possessed medals gained in\r\nmost of the campaigns of modern times have been interred with\r\nmilitary honours in the Protestant and Catholic cemeteries of the\r\ncity, through the auspices of the Fund.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               XI\r\n\r\n                      TEMPERANCE MOVEMENTS\r\n\r\n  SOCIETY FOR “PROMOTION OF TEMPERANCE”--THE YOUNG MEN’S TEMPERANCE\r\n    SOCIETY--MONTREAL TEMPERANCE SOCIETY--ST. PATRICK’S TOTAL\r\n    ABSTINENCE SOCIETY--THE SOCIETE DE TEMPERANCE DU DIOCESE DE\r\n    MONTREAL--OTHER SOCIETIES.\r\n\r\nThe author of “Hochelaga Depicta,” writing in 1839, describes the\r\ntemperance movement of his date, as follows:\r\n\r\n“The increasing prevalence of drunkenness, and the awful\r\nconsequences thence arising, have induced a general desire among\r\nthe sober and virtuous part of the community to stay the progress\r\nof so fearful an evil. Temperance societies have been formed,\r\nwith this express view, both in Europe and America, and have been\r\nproductive of the happiest effects. Thousands of drunkards have\r\nbeen reclaimed from their destructive habits.”\r\n\r\nA society for the “Promotion of Temperance” was formed in this\r\ncity on the 9th of June, 1828, at the suggestion of the Rev.\r\nJ.S. Christmas; the declaration was against the use of distilled\r\nspirits only.\r\n\r\nThe Young Men’s Temperance Society was formed on the 29th\r\nNovember, 1831. The two were afterwards united.\r\n\r\nOn the 27th of February, 1834, an executive committee was\r\nappointed by a convention then held, which continued to act\r\ntill the formation of the Montreal Society for the Promotion of\r\nTemperance on the 22d of October, 1835.\r\n\r\nThis society had the two pledges of abstinence from ardent\r\nspirits, and total abstinence from all intoxicating liquors. On\r\nthe 1st of September, 1837, the society was remodelled on the\r\ntotal abstinence principle alone under the name of the Montreal\r\nTemperance Society.\r\n\r\nSt. Patrick’s Total Abstinence Society was established on the 23d\r\nof February, 1840, by the Rev. Patrick Phelan and organized on\r\nthe 12th of February, 1854, by the Rev. J.F. Connolly.\r\n\r\nThe Société de Temperance du Diocése de Montreal was established\r\nin the city on January 5, 1841, by His Grace, the Bishop of\r\nNancy, and canonically erected by Mgr. Ignatius Bourget on\r\nJanuary 25, 1842, when the patronal name of St. Jean Baptiste\r\nwas given it. This society was established in various sectional\r\nbranches.\r\n\r\nOther movements have followed and Montreal has profited by\r\nthem. Among the present societies working in the city today\r\nare: Missionaries of Temperance, La Ligue, Anti-Alcoolique de\r\nMontreal, the Temperance Committee of La Fédération Nationale St.\r\nJean Baptiste, the Dominion Alliance (Montreal branch), Catholic\r\nTotal Abstinence Union (Canadian), St. Ann’s Total Abstinence and\r\nBenevolent Society, St. Ann’s Juvenile Temperance Society, St.\r\nGabriel’s, St Patrick’s, organized in 1854, St. Aloysius Society,\r\nSociété de Temperance de l’Eglise de St. Pierre and the society\r\norganized by the Franciscan Fathers, etc.\r\n\r\nThe city has houses for inebriates as follows:\r\n\r\nHouse of Good Shepherd, 64 Sherbrooke Street (women), and St.\r\nBenoit Joseph Asylum (men).\r\n\r\n\r\n                               XII\r\n\r\n           THE IMPROVEMENT OF THE CONDITION OF WORKERS\r\n\r\n  EARLY ASSOCIATIONS OF WORKERS--PROTESTANT INDUSTRIAL ROOMS--THE\r\n    LABOUR MOVEMENT--THE Y.M.C.A.--THE Y.W.C.A.--LE FOYER--THE\r\n    CATHOLIC GIRLS’ CLUB, ETC.\r\n\r\n\r\n                 EARLY ASSOCIATIONS FOR WORKERS\r\n\r\nThis chapter will record those movements which have tended to\r\nsafeguard the varied economical and educational interests of the\r\nworking classes. By consulting Mr. Huguet-Latour’s “Annuaire\r\nde Ville Marie” records of early bodies of a mutual benefit\r\nassociation character among French-Canadians will be found as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\nIn 1848, the Société St. Blandine was founded for domestic\r\nservant girls.\r\n\r\nThen came the era of mutual benefit associations for working\r\npeople, viz.: “Union St. Joseph,” founded March 22, 1852, by\r\nLouis Leclaire, and incorporated July 11, 1856.\r\n\r\nSociété de St. François Xavier, founded in 1853, by Rev. E.\r\nPicard, a Sulpician, and incorporated May 13, 1863.\r\n\r\nSociété Bienveillante de Notre Dame de Sécours, founded July 1,\r\n1853, and incorporated May 30, 1855.\r\n\r\nSociété Canadienne des Carpentiers et Menuisiers, founded\r\nDecember 6, 1853, by Antoine Mayer, George Rivet and Edouard F.\r\nDuncan. Incorporated July 24, 1858.\r\n\r\nAssociation St. Antoine, founded May 2, 1856, by Rev. E. Picard,\r\na Sulpician, and incorporated April 10, 1861.\r\n\r\nUnion St. Pierre, founded April 19, 1859.\r\n\r\nUnion St. Jean Baptiste, founded May 18, 1861, by P. Cerat, A.\r\nNormandin, F.X. Caron and Charles Bourque. Incorporated May 5,\r\n1863.\r\n\r\nUnion St. Louis (Coteau St. Louis), founded March 24, 1862, by\r\nIgnace Boucher and Dominique Dupré (fils).\r\n\r\nSt. Patrick’s Benevolent Society, founded on September 7, 1862,\r\nby Mr. Thomas Brennan, and incorporated on May 5, 1863.\r\n\r\nAssociation de Bienveillance de Bouchers Canadiens-Francais,\r\nfounded June 2, 1863.\r\n\r\nUnion St. Jacques, founded March 1, 1863.\r\n\r\nCaisse de la Section St. Joseph de la Société de Tempérance,\r\nfounded September 6, 1863.\r\n\r\nThe following provident movements for inculcating prevision and\r\nthrift may be recorded as follows:\r\n\r\nCaisse d’Economie des Instituteurs, December 22, 1856.\r\n\r\nCaisse d’Epargnes des Petites Servants de Pauvres (a lay\r\nassociation), founded February 6, 1859, by Rev. E. Picard.\r\n\r\nCaisse d’Economie de la Congrégation St. Michel, founded March 6,\r\n1859.\r\n\r\nOf late years there has been founded in the Province of Quebec\r\nthe Caisse Populaire, of which the Children’s Savings Banks in\r\nthe Immaculate Conception and the Infant Jesus parishes, and that\r\nof the general _caisse_ in the Immaculate Conception and St.\r\nEusebe parishes are examples.\r\n\r\nThe numerous modern institutions of mutual assurance, public\r\nemployment agencies and the helping associations for servants\r\nand workers which have arisen of late years need not be treated\r\nhistorically.\r\n\r\n\r\n                 THE PROTESTANT INDUSTRIAL ROOMS\r\n\r\nOne of the best principles in all social amelioration in the\r\ncondition of workers is to help the poor to help themselves. As\r\nan instance of this the history of the movement of the Protestant\r\nIndustrial Rooms of Montreal, which is now more than half a\r\ncentury old, is rightly in place here. Sixty years ago Miss\r\nHervey, who founded the Hervey Institute, did a wise and kind\r\nact when she opened a “Repository” for giving out to deserving\r\nfemales the surplus work of families, so creating the “Protestant\r\nIndustrial Rooms” of Montreal, which has grown up observing the\r\nsame fundamental principles. The first start was made in 1862 in\r\nthe rooms of the Hervey Institute, then on Lagauchetière Street,\r\nand shortly a transfer was made to St. Antoine Street, then one\r\nof the principal streets. In 1864 the Home of Industry and Refuge\r\nwas built on Dorchester Street and the governors invited the\r\nladies to take up quarters there. Until 1900 the kind offer was\r\naccepted. The work of providing sewing work to be done at home\r\nby poor but respectable women is now carried on at 57 Metcalfe\r\nStreet.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       THE LABOUR MOVEMENT\r\n\r\nFrench-Canadians began to learn the use of trade unions before\r\n1836, when they had commenced to migrate to New England\r\ncountries. In this year the first union was founded in Quebec,\r\nknown as the Association Typographique de Quebec. About the\r\nsame time there was founded at Montreal, the Shoemakers’ Union\r\nwhich was followed, in 1844, by the Stone Cutters’ Association.\r\nLittle by little the work of organization developed and became so\r\ngeneral that, at the time the movement of the Knights of Labour\r\narose, numerous lodges in the cities of Montreal and Quebec were\r\nformed. But, in 1886, the order of the Knights of Labour were\r\ntaken to task by the majority of the clergy with the result that\r\nall the lodges were broken up within a short time.\r\n\r\nOn the ruins of the Knights of Labour there arose the\r\nInternational Union of Cigar Makers, which concentrated for\r\na certain time all the strength of the international labour\r\nmovement and was the first one to inaugurate the celebration of\r\nLabour Day in Montreal.\r\n\r\nThen it was the turn of the Typographical Union, No. 145, made\r\nup exclusively of French-speaking members, and the Montreal\r\nTypographical Union, No. 176, followed by the Carpenters’ Union,\r\nwhich has developed to such an extent that, today in Montreal,\r\nit has seven locals and about three thousand members. Local No.\r\n134 of this union is made up exclusively of French-speaking\r\nworkmen and comprises about two thousand three hundred members.\r\nAn impetus had been given, and the international labour movement\r\nis still powerful. Today there are 194 international unions in\r\nthe Province of Quebec with a membership of over forty thousand\r\nmembers, of which 109 locals, comprising over thirty thousand\r\nmembers, are in Montreal. The proportion of French-speaking\r\nmembers belonging to these unions is:\r\n\r\nBuilding trades, 75 per cent; boot and shoe industry, 90 per\r\ncent; cigar and printing trades, 90 per cent; metallurgy,\r\nmachinists, etc., 25 per cent; railway employees, 50 per cent;\r\nmusicians and others, 80 per cent.\r\n\r\nAs an example of what can be accomplished by political action\r\ncombined with trade unionism, it may be pointed out to the credit\r\nof the workingmen of the City of Montreal, that it is the only\r\ncity throughout the whole Dominion which found a way of electing\r\none of its own labour members to the House of Parliament, Mr.\r\nAlphonse Verville, who was returned in 1906 by a strong majority,\r\nbeing reelected twice since by a still larger majority.\r\n\r\nIn the City of Montreal, another worker, Joseph Ainey, was\r\nelected as city commissioner by a majority of 8,000 votes over\r\nand above that of the second commissioner elected in the City of\r\nMontreal.\r\n\r\nIt is well to place a record here of the average annual salary of\r\nvarious classes of wage-earners in Montreal at present:\r\n\r\n  Bricklayers               $800.00\r\n  Carpenters                 700.00\r\n  Plumbers                   750.00\r\n  Plasterer                  750.00\r\n  Stone Cutters              800.00\r\n  Granite Cutters            800.00\r\n  Painters                   700.00\r\n  Electricians               700.00\r\n  Structural Iron Workers    600.00\r\n  Building Laborers          500.00\r\n  Brass Workers              750.00\r\n  Moulders                   750.00\r\n  Machinists                 750.00\r\n  Blacksmiths                750.00\r\n  Typos                      900.00\r\n  Pressmen                   800.00\r\n  Bookbinders                750.00\r\n  Stereotypers               650.00\r\n  Cigarmakers                750.00\r\n  Shoemakers                 650.00\r\n  Musicians                  800.00\r\n  Butchers                   650.00\r\n  Barbers                    600.00\r\n  Tailors                    600.00\r\n  Weavers                    600.00\r\n  Laundry Workers            500.00\r\n\r\nA central executive entitled “The Trades and Labour Council”\r\nhas done very effective work in harmonizing difficulties and in\r\npromoting useful legislation for the working classes.\r\n\r\n\r\n              THE YOUNG MEN’S CHRISTIAN ASSOCIATION\r\n\r\n[3] The development of the modern moral and intellectual\r\nassistance for the worker may now be instanced. The work of the\r\nY.M.C.A., now so largely developed on the American continent,\r\nowes its origin to Montreal. Its history is briefly thus. It\r\nwas in the Baptist Church on St. Helen’s Street, in the ’50s,\r\nthat the beginnings of the association took form. The official\r\ndate given on a tablet placed on the Gault Building on St. Helen\r\nStreet places the date as November, 1851.\r\n\r\nAmong those present were Messrs. F.E. Grafton, T. James Claxton,\r\nW.H. Milne, F.H. Marling, and John Holland. Mr. Marling, who was\r\na student in the Congregational College, was chairman of the\r\nmeeting. A canvass was made of the churches and encouragement\r\nobtained for the project. One of the planks in the constitution\r\nwas that the association would never admit any intermeddling with\r\nthose matters of faith and polity on which the Protestant church\r\nmay differ.\r\n\r\nThere was a general committee appointed and this body rented the\r\nOdd Fellows’ Hall on St. James Street. In 1851, the Rev. Donald\r\nFraser, the pastor of Coté Street Presbyterian Church, delivered\r\nthe inaugural lecture.\r\n\r\nThe young association had much difficulty to realize growth, but\r\na city missionary was appointed to give his whole time to the\r\nwork of obtaining support, and of familiarizing the churches and\r\nthe people generally with the objects of the work.\r\n\r\nMr. John Holland, one of the original members, moved to Toronto\r\nin 1853, and was instrumental in forming the first association in\r\nthat city.\r\n\r\nThere was a confederation of all the associations on this\r\ncontinent in 1855, and to this the local association gave its\r\nadhesion. All the European associations met this same year at\r\nParis, and reached what was known as the “Paris basis,” to which\r\nthe local association also gave its adhesion.\r\n\r\nIn 1856 the Confederated Association met in Montreal, and\r\nadopted the basis of union. Montreal was, therefore, not only\r\nthe birthplace of the organization on the continent, but at the\r\nmeeting in the city the basis of union was adopted, which has\r\nsince bound all the associations on this continent together.\r\n\r\nThe Montreal association moved to 205 Notre Dame Street, where\r\nits membership reached 205. Some of the names of the then members\r\nhave an interest for the present generation of Montrealers. Men\r\nlike Charles Alexander, James Baylis, George S. Bransh, T. James\r\nClaxton, J.P. Cleghorn, George Childs, W. Cooper, David Bentley,\r\nRobert Gardner, F.E. Grafton, E.K. Greene, Alexander Harte, W.R.\r\nHibbard, Robert Irwin, F.W. Kay, Joseph Learmount, S.H. Burnett,\r\nThomas Leeming, John Louson, Theodore Lyman, A. McGibbon, Samuel\r\nMassey, G. May, John Murphy, William Muir, A.A. Stevenson, Robert\r\nDow, Henry Drummond, Kenneth Campbell, Henry Morton, J. Tees, J.\r\nHolland, P.L. Ross, H.A. Nelson, Alfred Savage, John Torrance,\r\nJoseph Rielle, John Dougall, John Lewis, R.C. Jamieson, and many\r\nothers.\r\n\r\nIn 1857 the slavery question in the United States became acute,\r\nand was felt its influence here. It was the slavery question\r\nwhich was the cause of the Montreal association withdrawing\r\nfrom the confederation. A resolution was passed declaring that\r\nslave holders were ineligible for membership. The international\r\nconvention was to be held in Richmond. The Montreal association\r\nwas asked to vote on the question. It resolved that as southern\r\nassociations which rejected men of color, were connected with the\r\nconfederation, the Montreal association resigned its connection\r\nwith the same. This slavery question created much feeling at the\r\ntime. Many outside associations followed the Montreal example.\r\n\r\nIn 1858 the association removed to 90 McGill Street. It was in\r\nthis year that the late Sir William Dawson connected himself with\r\nthe work, remaining with it till his death. It was the habit,\r\nlong before the erection of the present Sailors’ Institute, to\r\nvisit all the ships coming into port and talk to the sailors who\r\nwere given suitable literature.\r\n\r\nThe fortunes of the association were at a low ebb in 1862, and,\r\nin fact, there was talk of disbanding. A meeting for that purpose\r\nwas called; but the result was a determination to prosecute the\r\nwork with more energy than ever. Rooms were secured over the Bank\r\nof Upper Canada, then on St. James Street. The association began\r\nto flourish. A fire broke out in the building, and in 1863 a new\r\nsuite of rooms was secured adjoining the postoffice. Each year\r\nonward showed from this point increased success.\r\n\r\nThe city was properly classified; the bands of workers increased.\r\nMr. Alfred Sandham was secured as general secretary, and remained\r\nin the position till 1876, when he was succeeded by Mr. Budge.\r\n\r\nIn 1867 the association removed to the Bible House at the corner\r\nof Craig and Alexander streets. In this year, the twelfth\r\ninternational convention was held in the city. This convention\r\nrepresented 106 associations and 597 delegates. Major-General\r\nRussell, commander of the British forces, and Sir Henry Havelock\r\nwere among the speakers on the important occasion. Occurring at\r\nthe close of the Civil War, the meetings were remarkable for the\r\ninterest and fervour, for the slaves had been freed, at fearful\r\ncost, and it was a sight to see the delegation of colored men who\r\nwere, for the first time, received as accredited delegates.\r\n\r\nThe idea of the association was to have its own building, and\r\ngreat efforts were made in this connection. It was in 1870 that\r\nsteps were taken to secure the property at the corner of Craig\r\nand Radegonde streets. The cornerstone was laid in 1872 by Mr.\r\nJ.T. Claxton. Revs. G.C. Wells, Doctor Burns and Doctor Wilkes,\r\nwere among the speakers. Comfortably installed in their new\r\nbuilding, the work progressed. It had been in seven different\r\nbuildings since its inception. It now owned its own premises.\r\nMr. Budge began his work in 1874 as general secretary. The total\r\nmembership was in this year 1,360.\r\n\r\nIt was the late Mr. Moody who decided upon the present site\r\nof the association. The work had become too large for the\r\naccommodation on Victoria Square. The population had greatly\r\nincreased. The membership felt this increase. Enlarged interests\r\nhad been cared for; and the training and education of boys had\r\nbeen undertaken. Mr. Moody had been in the city and held a most\r\nsuccessful series of meetings in what was known as the old\r\nCrystal Rink on the corner of Metcalfe and Dorchester streets\r\nfacing Dominion Square. There was doubt as to the location of the\r\nnew association building. He was asked for his opinion. “Why not\r\nbuild it on the site of the Crystal Rink?” he said. His counsel\r\nprevailed, and in 1888 the deed was signed, which transferred the\r\nsite of the present building to the association.\r\n\r\nHere the work grew marvellously. It has branched out in many\r\nimportant directions. It has supported men in India; it has sent\r\nout men to South Africa during the Boer war; it has added to its\r\nmembership and activities and its recent triumph, when it raised\r\nover $200,000 for the further extension of the work in the new\r\nand enlarged building, is within recent memory.\r\n\r\nThe new home on Drummond Street was entered on August 1, 1912,\r\nand was formally opened in September.\r\n\r\nFrom the little Baptist Church on St. Helen Street to the\r\npalatial home of the association is a long step, but it is an\r\nanswer to the demand for this sort of service on behalf of the\r\nyoung in our city.\r\n\r\n\r\n        THE MONTREAL YOUNG WOMEN’S CHRISTIAN ASSOCIATION\r\n\r\nThe Montreal Young Women’s Christian Association was organized\r\nand incorporated in 1874 under the presidency of Mrs. P.D. Brown,\r\nits central idea being that of helpfulness--physical, moral, and\r\nspiritual--for industrial women.\r\n\r\nIts first purpose was to provide a boarding home which should be\r\nin no sense a charity, where young business women and students\r\nmight find a safe home free from the numerous temptations which\r\nbeset the young woman in the city. This part of the work has only\r\nbeen limited by the size of the building; today about eighty-five\r\nyoung women are housed in the association building, and fifty\r\nin an annex which was opened in 1908. Early in 1914 another\r\nbuilding, to accommodate fifty more, was opened.\r\n\r\nIts second purpose was to provide an employment bureau where\r\nsuitable work was found for the stranger.\r\n\r\nSome of the activities of the association may now be mentioned.\r\n\r\nIn 1880, the necessity for a diet kitchen was felt, and in the\r\nbasement of the American Presbyterian Church, under the wing of\r\nthe Young Women’s Christian Association, one was opened. Here\r\nthe ladies themselves prepared suitable articles for diet for\r\ninvalids, the food dispensed only to applicants provided with a\r\ncard from clergy or the medical profession. In a few years this\r\nwork became so necessary that it separated from the Young Women’s\r\nChristian Association and carried on its good work alone.\r\n\r\nThe Montreal Day Nursery, or crèche, was begun by the Young\r\nWomen’s Christian Association in 1888, but like the Montreal Diet\r\nDispensary it outgrew its sponsors and branched out for itself,\r\nand has long been one of the most popular of Montreal’s charities.\r\n\r\nThe Helping Hand sewing school was opened in 1875, its object\r\nbeing to teach the children of the poor to sew.\r\n\r\nIn 1894, the first school for cookery in Montreal was opened\r\nby the Young Women’s Christian Association, its object being\r\nto teach the poorer classes habits of thrift and economy. This\r\ncontinued for many years, or until the normal and technical\r\nschools took up the work.\r\n\r\nThus the Young Women’s Christian Association has been the pioneer\r\nin many of the flourishing charitable and philanthropic works of\r\nMontreal.\r\n\r\nEducational classes have been a large factor in Young Women’s\r\nChristian Association work, classes being held nightly in\r\ndressmaking, millinery, shorthand, first aid to injured, French,\r\nbookkeeping, and elementary subjects.\r\n\r\nThe first Montreal Young Women’s Christian Association work\r\nbegan at 47 Metcalfe Street. Three moves were made as the work\r\ndeveloped, until in 1897 the present building was bought, but\r\neven then the opportunity for progressive movement has been\r\nhampered by the limited space. Plans for a larger and more modern\r\nbuilding are under consideration.\r\n\r\nIn addition there is the Fairmount Branch Y.W.C.A. and those\r\nbranches at 323 Mackey Street and 25 St. Famille Street.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            LE FOYER\r\n\r\nAn important work for French business girls on the same lines\r\nas the Young Women’s Christian Association is conducted by “Le\r\nFoyer,” which was established in March, 1903, under the direction\r\nof the Curé of St. Jacques, on St. Denis Street--M. Henri\r\nGauthier. The first house of the society was at 207 Champ de Mars\r\nand its first directress was Mlle. Marie Imbleau. As the work\r\nprogressed a branch house was instituted at 14 Osborne Street,\r\nthe first directress of which was Miss Gabrielle Taschereau.\r\nLater a second branch house was opened at 55 St. Denis Street\r\nunder the direction of Mlle. Leona Bonneville. In addition\r\nthere is a country house at Ste. Adèle, which receives during\r\nthe summer months thirty-five boarders a week. The organization\r\nhas a central office at 60 Notre Dame Street and its government\r\nis under a committee of lay people of whom Mlle. Emma Beaudoin\r\nis the present president. Each of the three houses has its own\r\nsecretary. There are 800 meals served daily in the three houses,\r\nwith about five hundred at the chief house on Champ de Mars,\r\nwhile there are 125 regular boarders besides transients. The\r\npension is $2.50 a week. The activities include the _Bureau\r\nd’emplacement_ in which situations are arranged for, and the\r\n_Bureau d’enseignement_, which provides for culture and education\r\nthrough lectures, classes, etc. There are also social, musical,\r\ndomestic science and other clubs in connection with this varied\r\nwork.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    THE CATHOLIC GIRLS’ CLUB\r\n\r\nA work which is conducted on somewhat similar lines to the Young\r\nWomen’s Christian Association is the Catholic Girls’ Club.\r\n\r\nOn March 20, 1911, Lady Hingston called together a number of\r\nladies from the various English-speaking parishes and invited\r\ntheir cooperation in forming a Catholic Girls’ Club. The idea was\r\nenthusiastically received, a committee was promptly formed and,\r\nwith Lady Hingston as president, the scheme was fairly launched.\r\nA house, 63 Victoria Street, was rented for a year and thanks to\r\nan efficient committee, was furnished and ready for occupation in\r\nan incredibly short space of time.\r\n\r\nEarly in June the rooms were formally opened by His Grace,\r\nArchbishop Bruchesi, under the name of the “Catholic Girls’\r\nClub,” while the opening for the members took place on June 6th.\r\n\r\nA large and successful bazaar, under the convenership of Mrs.\r\nCornwallis Monk, was held in October, 1911, the proceeds of which\r\nenabled the committee to arrange for the purchase of the present\r\nhandsome club house, 311 Mackay Street, and to make the first\r\nnecessary payments.\r\n\r\nAmong other agencies for business girls may be mentioned “Ave\r\nMarie,” La Providence, Maison St. Nom de Marie, Patronage\r\nd’Youville and the business organizations under affiliation\r\nwith La Fédération St. Jean Baptiste. There are many also among\r\nthe non-Catholic population, the branches of the Young Women’s\r\nChristian Association, and the like.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              XIII\r\n\r\n                     RECENT SOCIAL MOVEMENTS\r\n\r\n  NEIGHBOURLY CHARITIES--THE KING’S DAUGHTERS--THE UNIVERSITY\r\n    AND IVERLEY SETTLEMENTS--THE SETTLEMENT IDEA--SOCIAL STUDY\r\n    ORGANIZATIONS--THE CANADIAN SOCIETY FOR THE PREVENTION OF CRUELTY\r\n    TO ANIMALS.\r\n\r\n“Neighbourly” charities in Montreal flourish in many a corner too\r\nnumerous to individualize. Of late both in the French, or English\r\nand foreign sections of the city, Free Air and Summer Vacation\r\ncommittees, and others such as the “Holiday” Home, the various\r\ncrèches and relief associations and churches, do their utmost\r\nto give rest and holidays to poor mothers and children. Other\r\nbodies assist in sewing and making garments for them such as the\r\n“Needlework Guild,” and the sewing circles of the various church\r\nclubs. Then there are associations with a wide scope which are\r\nready to take up the social work most needed for the hour, such\r\nas the Victorian Sunshine Society, which originated at Westmount,\r\nand many others.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      THE KING’S DAUGHTERS\r\n\r\nOne of the latter societies is the “King’s Daughters,” an\r\ninternational association founded in 1886 and established in\r\nMontreal in 1888 by the Ready Circle in connection with the\r\nAmerican Presbyterian Church. This work is now carried on by\r\nthe crèche on Côte des Neiges Road opposite the old entrance to\r\nthe Mountain Park. The primary aim of the King’s Daughters is\r\nto deepen the spiritual life and to engage in social works. The\r\ncrèche is one form of such and since its establishment in 1908,\r\nfirst at Outremont then at Côte des Neiges and now at the above\r\nplace it receives poor families with their children during three\r\nmonths of summer for daily rest, fresh air and relaxation, even\r\npaying their transportation thither.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    THE UNIVERSITY SETTLEMENT\r\n\r\nThe “settlement” or “neighbourhood” movement which culminated\r\nin the formation of the University Settlement House at 159\r\nDorchester Street West in May, 1910, when two of the organizing\r\ncommittee, Mrs. W.P. Hodges and Mrs. D. McIntosh set to work\r\ncleaning up the little tenement and founded the nucleus of a\r\nsettlement round the classes of the McGill Neighbourhood Club,\r\nmay be traced to an earlier move originating with social workers\r\nin connection with McGill University. The following synopsis will\r\nshow in brief the progress accomplished from 1889 to 1913:\r\n\r\n1889--The Mu Iota Society was formed by the women graduates of\r\nMcGill University.\r\n\r\n1890--Its name changed to Alumnæ Society.\r\n\r\nMay, 1891--Girls’ Club and lunch room was opened by the Alumnæ\r\nSociety at 47 Jurors Street.\r\n\r\nMay, 1894--Girls’ Club was moved to 84 Bleury Street.

Eighty-two boys and\r\ngirls of King’s Club were present.\r\n\r\n1907-8--Rooms taken for the King’s Club at 308 Lagauchetière\r\nStreet West.\r\n\r\nOctober, 1908--Workers’ Committee formed into “The McGill\r\nUniversity Neighbourhood Club” as part of the Alumnæ Society.\r\n\r\nJanuary, 1909--McGill Y.M.C.A. formally joins in the work of\r\nNeighbourhood Club.\r\n\r\nFall, 1909-Spring, 1910--The use of the Belmont School granted by\r\nthe Protestant Board of School Commissioners.\r\n\r\nJanuary, 1910--Settlement Committee formed by the Alumnæ and\r\nMcGill University Neighbourhood Club.\r\n\r\nFebruary 8, 1910--Lecture by Miss Sadie American on\r\n“Settlements,” given under the auspices of the Montreal Local\r\nCouncil of Women in the interests of the Neighbourhood Club.

The use of Dufferin School\r\ngymnasium again granted by the Protestant Board of School\r\nCommissioners. The first president was Prof. J.A. Dale of McGill\r\nUniversity.\r\n\r\nOctober, 1910--Annex of rooms at 189 Dorchester Street West,\r\nmade necessary. Becomes headquarters for Scouts, library, and\r\nkindergarten.\r\n\r\nDecember, 1910--First salaried headworker engaged.\r\n\r\nJanuary, 1911--Use of two rooms in St. John’s Parish House,\r\nOntario Street West, given by Rev.

Duke of\r\nConnaught in a handsomely remodeled bottling factory at 179\r\nDorchester Street West.\r\n\r\n\r\n                     THE IVERLEY SETTLEMENT\r\n\r\nThe Iverley Settlement followed in September, 1911, through the\r\ninstrumentality of Mrs. Ivan Wotherspoon and her friends, the\r\norganizing committee meeting on June 4th preceding.\r\n\r\nA house was taken on September 13th with the approval of\r\nJudge Archer and Mr. Eugene Lafleur, K.C., who from the first\r\nhave evinced their entire sympathy with the work, and active\r\npreparations were made for its development. From the moment the\r\nIverley was ready, children and their parents flocked in, thus\r\nshowing the value even of the settlement idea as a powerful\r\nmodern force for social betterment. Other settlements of a more\r\nparochial or church affiliation have since adopted the movement.\r\n\r\nThe settlement idea has been productive of imitation or a\r\nreadjustment of other forms of charitable endeavours so long\r\nemployed in connection with the many churches, religious and\r\nother institutions of the city.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          SOCIAL STUDY\r\n\r\nThe social movements just recorded also have succeeded in\r\nbringing social students together. Cooperation between the\r\nEnglish and French associations began about 1910 to be more\r\nfrequent in social enterprises. Intercommunication by lectures\r\nand round table conferences, the interchange of literature and\r\nintercourse with expert sociologists from England, the United\r\nStates and the continent, have had a very broadening effect on\r\nour sociological life. A school of social study and publication\r\nstarted up in the French educational circles about 1912 under\r\nthe title of L’école Sociale Populaire, the English Catholics\r\nhaving previously, about 1911, started a Social Study Guild. In\r\nconnection with the leading social organizations, a Social Study\r\nClub was also founded about 1912 for discussion among experts\r\nof problems of sociology. All these forces having influence in\r\nhigh civic circles, Montreal received at this period a stimulus\r\nin social reform which has been distinctly a phase of our present\r\ncivic life.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               XIV\r\n\r\n                       MUNICIPAL CHARITIES\r\n\r\nThe action of the city as such has been partially noticed also\r\nin other social works. Its Department of Assistance Municipal,\r\norganized about 1904, dispenses the city’s charities regarding\r\nthe reformatories and industrial schools; the insane, of whom\r\nin 1913 it supported 242 at St. Jean de Dieu and 98 at Verdun\r\ninsane asylums; the incurables, of whom 43 were kept in 1913 at\r\nNotre Dame de Grace Hospital for Incurables and the Grey Nuns;\r\ntuberculosis patients, for whom in 1913 the sum of $14,300 was\r\napportioned as follows:\r\n\r\n  Hôpital des Incurables      $7,500.00\r\n  Royal Edward Institute       3,300.00\r\n  Grace Dart Home                500.00\r\n  Bruchesi Institute           3,000.00\r\n\r\nThe department deports from the city for causes of misbehaviour,\r\nillness or insanity. In 1913 448 cases were deported to England,\r\nIreland, Scotland, Jamaica, Judea, Egypt, Russia, United States,\r\nAustria, Guadeloupe, France, Italy, Normay, Germany, Australia,\r\nSwitzerland, Greece and Belgium.\r\n\r\nTwo hundred destitute persons were repatriated in 1913, or\r\nfifty-eight more than in 1912.\r\n\r\nRelief is given to homeless poor and unemployed, which was larger\r\nin 1913 owing to the economic crisis prevailing over Canada and\r\nto the fact that in the fall many immigrants flocked from the\r\nharvest fields in the West to the city, and also because there\r\nwas an extraordinary influx of foreigners whose cheap labour\r\ncaused the discharge of others of British origin. The number of\r\ncases dealt with in 1913 by the city apart from the ordinary\r\nregular volunteer charities, was 648 (or 105 per cent more than\r\nin 1912).\r\n\r\nThese 648 cases reported to the city department and handled\r\nby the Charity Organization Society for it, were dealt with\r\nas follows: 181 were temporarily relieved, 79 repatriated, 43\r\ncommitted to the “Assistance Publique,” 10 committed to various\r\ninstitutions, 9 committed to the Hôtel-Dieu, 6 given with\r\nemployment, 6 deported, 5 confined in the Notre-Dame Hospital, 5\r\nreferred to the Society for the Protection of Women and Children,\r\n5 given legal advice, 5 referred to the Municipal Labor Bureau, 4\r\ncommitted to the Hospital for Incurables, 4 referred to the Baron\r\nde Hirsch Institute, 4 placed in the Royal Victoria Hospital,\r\n3 referred to the “Union Nationale Française,” 3 placed in the\r\nProtestant House of Industry, 3 placed in the General Hospital, 2\r\nreferred to the Old Brewery Mission, 2 placed in the Institution\r\nof the Grey Nuns, 2 placed in the St. Bridget’s Home, 2 referred\r\nto the Salvation Army, 2 referred to the St. Vincent de Paul\r\nSociety, 1 was placed in the Bruchesi Institute, 1 placed in\r\nthe Maternity, 1 referred to the Montreal Ladies’ Benevolent\r\nSociety, 1 placed in the St. Henry Asylum, 1 placed in the\r\nYouville Patronage, 1 placed in the Nazareth Asylum, 1 placed in\r\nthe Sheltering Home, 1 placed in the St. Benoit Asylum, 1 placed\r\nin the St. Paul Hospital, 1 referred to the Belgian Society, 165\r\nwere refused relief and 88 did not report.\r\n\r\nThe city in 1913 made grants to the charitable institutions and\r\npublic bodies of Montreal to the amount of $105,996.00. The city,\r\nhowever, remits a great amount of the assessment of charitable\r\ninstitutions.\r\n\r\nThe value of the properties belonging to charitable institutions\r\nand exempted from taxation, in 1913, was $23,131,660.00.\r\n\r\nThe assessment of 1 per cent therefore represents $231,316.60.\r\n\r\nThe City of Montreal paid, in 1913, for the relief of destitute\r\npersons a sum of $497,712.35, as follows:\r\n\r\n  Remittance of assessments                        $231,316.60\r\n  Grants                                            105,996.00\r\n  Maintenance of insane                              83,249.60\r\n  Maintenance of children in industrial schools      69,450.15\r\n  Miscellaneous                                       7,700.00\r\n                                                    -----------\r\n     Total                                         $497,712.35\r\n\r\n  Or $53,809.94 more than in 1912.\r\n\r\n  In 1912                                          $443,902.41\r\n  In 1911                                           356,758.00\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[1] Quoted from “Hochelaga Depicta.”\r\n\r\n[2] The Sulpicians and the Grey Nuns early commenced their\r\nconnection with Irish orphans. In 1758, M. de Lavalinière, a\r\nSulpician, succeeded by his entreaties and promises in rescuing\r\nan Irish child of the name of O’Flaherty from the hands of fierce\r\nIndians. She was but a few months old and was already tied to\r\nthe stake to be burned alive with her mother when the generous\r\nliberator came to the rescue. Madame d’Youville voluntarily\r\nconsented to take charge of her, and the child became a Grey Nun.\r\n\r\n[3] Cf. the reminiscences of a leading citizen given in the\r\nMontreal Star of January 2, 1912.

After the American war of 1775, business began to\r\nflourish. One of the earliest of the firms of this period was the\r\ntailor business founded by Benaiah Gibb, whose son, also Benaiah,\r\nbecame a benefactor to the Art Association of Montreal. Benaiah\r\nGibb, who came in 1774, at the age of twenty years, succeeded to\r\na Mr. McFarlain. In 1782 there came Mr. John Molson, who started\r\na brewery in the east end, and in 1809 pioneered the steamship\r\nlines of Canada. About 1800 was established the retail drug firm\r\nof (George) Wadsworth & (Lewis) Lyman. This became a wholesale\r\nbusiness, also, in 1829, and today the Lyman Drug Company is\r\nthe direct lineal descendant. The great Montreal Ogilvie flour\r\nmilling business was begun in 1801 by Mr. Ogilvie at Jacques\r\nCartier near Quebec. Shortly afterwards, perceiving that Montreal\r\nwas to rise superior in the commercial world, he erected a mill\r\non the Lachine Rapids. The Glenora Mills on the Lachine Canal\r\nwere erected in 1852 by his grandsons, A.W., John and W.W.\r\nOgilvie. The Ogilvie mills have since spread over the Dominion.\r\n\r\nThere were far-seeing men, at the beginning of the nineteenth\r\ncentury. A few years after its opening a visiting traveler had\r\nthe following prophetic view of Montreal as the emporium of the\r\nnorthern world:\r\n\r\n“The City is that subdivision which is enclosed by the ancient\r\nfortifications, the ramparts, fosse and glacis of which are\r\nsuffered to go to decay. Its form is that of a trapezium, or\r\nquadrilateral figure whose sides are unequal. It is situated on\r\nan incline plane, gently descending towards the eastern branch of\r\nthe St. Lawrence River, in whose ample bosom the Island itself,\r\nwith all its villages, gentlemen’s seats, and cultivated farms,\r\nreposes. The following was the population about this time:\r\n\r\n                          Houses.  Males.  Females.\r\n  City of Montreal         485     1,541    1,642\r\n  St. Lawrence suburbs     514     1,292    1,488\r\n  St. Antoine do.          144       348      346\r\n  Recollet do.             187       552      620\r\n  Quebec do.      256      783       784\r\n  Grey Nunnery do.           1        38       94\r\n\r\n“The return of men able to bear arms give an aggregate of 3,392;\r\nbut as little or no attention is given to their exercises and\r\ndiscipline, even that number is contemptible in the estimation\r\nof a military man, who in war justly considers an undisciplined\r\nmob as an encumbrance rather than help. Should Montreal ever\r\nbe attacked it can only be defended by British troops. Without\r\nthese the inhabitants would not be likely to irritate a powerful\r\nassailant by ineffectual resistance. As a military position, the\r\nplace would not be worth a contest, as it would remain no longer\r\nin the hands of the garrison than they would keep possession\r\nof the high level ground that commands the city. But its local\r\nadvantages for commercial purposes and manufactures are so great\r\nand various that it will inevitably become the Emporium of the\r\nNorthern World.\r\n\r\n“At the head of ship navigation, on the waters of the majestic\r\nSt. Lawrence, like the heart in the human body, it will be the\r\ngrand reservoir into which all the streams connected with that\r\nimmense river must pour their contents. The inhabitants bordering\r\non these waters on the lakes in the northern part of Vermont and\r\nwestern part of New York must necessarily make it the depot for\r\nwhatever articles of export their labours may produce, and take\r\nin return whatever merchandise they consume.\r\n\r\n“Those countries, particularly New York and Vermont, are\r\npopulating so fast that the commerce of Montreal must increase\r\nrapidly unless the mechants’ inattention to their own interests\r\nshould neglect to import goods in such quantity and variety\r\nas will render it unnecessary for the country traders to have\r\nrecourse to the markets of New York and Boston. At present the\r\ncommerce of Montreal is principally confined to the fur trade,\r\nand collateral relations, under the direction of a company of\r\nwealthy, independent, enterprising merchants, whose immense\r\ncapital and judicious arrangements have set at defiance every\r\nkind of competition. But the other mercantile departments remain\r\nunoccupied, and men of industry and property might, with a well\r\ngrounded prospect of success, establish houses for conducting\r\nthose branches of commerce which are less expensive, troublesome\r\nand hazardous than the fur trade.”\r\n\r\nIn 1802 an act (George III, 1802, Cap. V) provided for the\r\napplication of £1,200 currency to enable the inhabitants to\r\n“enter on the culture of hemp with facility and advantage.” The\r\nhemp was to be used for cordage for the Royal Navy. Committees\r\nwere formed at Quebec and Montreal. The following advertisement\r\nappeared in the official gazette in English and French: “Notice\r\nis hereby given to persons inclined to raise hemp that seed\r\nwill be delivered gratis at Quebec and Montreal to such persons\r\nas will engage to sow the same, not exceeding two and one-half\r\nbushels to one person, and that nine pence per pound will be\r\npaid for clean hemp of the growth of Lower Canada equal to\r\nsamples of Russian clean hemp to be seen at Quebec and Montreal,\r\nand delivered on or before the 30th of September, 1803, and\r\n12 shillings and 6 pence per bushel for good ripe hemp seed\r\ndelivered on or before the 1st of January, 1803.” Premiums were\r\noffered to societies and in 1804 Mr. Isaac Winslow Clarke,\r\nchairman of the Montreal committee, received the gold medal\r\nfrom the Society of Arts for hemp grown in Lower Canada. Great\r\ninterest was sustained for a time, but it was found useless to\r\ncompete with Russia. Sir Joseph Banks, the president of the\r\nRoyal Society, in reply to a reference from the Board of Trade,\r\nconcluded that the exportation of hemp from Russia could not\r\nbe stopped, that no matter at how low a price the British or\r\ncolonial producer offered it, Russian hemp would still be lower.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the principal retail businesses, the butchers, the\r\nbakers, the candlestick makers, and the rest, were growing in\r\nimportance in their shops on St. Paul Street over which they\r\nand their families lived. The historian, Heriot, says of these\r\nin 1805: “The habitations of the principal merchants are neat\r\nand commodious and their storehouses are spacious and secured\r\nagainst loss from fire, being covered with sheet iron or tin.”\r\nSpeaking of the markets he also says: “The markets of Montreal\r\nare more abundantly supplied than those of Quebec, and articles\r\nare sold at more reasonable prices, especially in winter, when\r\nthe inhabitants of the United States who reside on the borders\r\nof Canada bring for sale a part of the produce of their farms.\r\nQuantities of fish are likewise conveyed thither in sleighs from\r\nBoston.”\r\n\r\nAt this time there were 142 slaves in the Montreal district,\r\nalthough their importation had been forbidden in Canada since\r\n1793, and their perpetuation in Lower Canada was disfavoured by\r\nthe bill of 1799, in which year there was a petition of Montreal\r\ncitizens to secure master’s rights over them. In the first\r\nissue of the Montreal Gazette of June 3, 1778, the following\r\nadvertisement appeared: “Ran away on the 14th inst., a slave\r\nbelonging to the widow Dufy Desaulniers, aged about thirty-five\r\nyears, dressed in striped calico of the ordinary cut, of\r\ntolerable stoutness. Whoever will bring her back will receive a\r\nreward of $6.00 and will be repaid any costs that may be proved\r\nto have been incurred in finding her.”\r\n\r\nIn 1807 with the growing trade an act was passed for a new market\r\nhouse in Montreal. The year 1808 marks the advent of a second\r\nbrewery firm, that of Dow & Dunn, with D. & D. on their bottles\r\nof beer and whiskey. The first brewery was at La Prairie and the\r\nliquor was shipped across the river. The business was started\r\nby Mr. Dow who shortly took Mr. J. Dunn into partnership. Its\r\nlineage is Dow, Dunn, White, Harris, Scott, Hooper, and it is now\r\nmerged, about 1911, into the National Breweries Company, into\r\nwhich the Molson firm never entered.\r\n\r\nIn 1809 Mr. John Frothingham founded the firm now known as\r\nFrothingham & Workman. The factory was at Côte St. Paul and\r\nwas the pioneer business to introduce the ax and tool industry\r\ngenerally into Canada. An interesting relic retained by the firm\r\nis an invoice for shelf hardware imported from England in the\r\nspring of 1815 and contains this note at the bottom: “The premium\r\non insurance has risen since the reappearance of Bonaparte and\r\nthe above is the best terms we could obtain.” The reappearance\r\nwas due to Napoleon’s escape from Elba. In 1850 William Workman\r\nwas admitted to the firm. He was the well known alderman, mayor,\r\nmember of parliament--a good citizen. In 1809 the prospects of\r\ntrade were heightened by Molson’s introduction of steamships\r\nin Canada. A third brewery was started in 1811 by Mr. Thomas\r\nA. Dawes. It was located at Lachine, probably for two reasons,\r\nthe water supply and the opportunity to supply the northwestern\r\nexpeditions into the fur lands directed by Sir George Simpson,\r\nthe governor of the Hudson’s Bay Company, whose headquarters\r\nwere at Lachine. The Dawes firm also lately became merged in the\r\nNational Breweries Company.\r\n\r\nA faded ledger of 1815, begun by Joseph Beckett & Company on\r\nSt. Paul Street, marks the foundation of a Montreal drug firm\r\nalmost a century old which, through Beckett & Company, Carter\r\n& McDonald, John Carter & Company, John Birks & Company, John\r\nCarter & Company, Carter, Kerry & Company, Kerry Brothers &\r\nCompany, Weston & Company, leads to the National Drug Company.\r\nThe ledger above mentioned is historically interesting, as it\r\nreveals some of the names of the leaders of social life in the\r\nearly days of the nineteenth century. A study of it reveals the\r\nfollowing facts:\r\n\r\nFirst of all there are the Earl and Countess of Selkirk--regular\r\ncustomers of the firm, buying powders and pomades and perfume,\r\nattar of roses, and the like, as becomes extreme delicacy, high\r\nposition and a super-refinement, not forgotten in a raw community.\r\n\r\nWe have Colonels and Captains and Lieutenants, who were in\r\nabundant evidence in the life of the city at the time; medical\r\nmen; esquires by the score--all in account with Mr. Beckett for\r\nprescriptions and toilet articles, and delicate perfumes and\r\naromatic waters and powders and lip salve and pomades to give\r\nthe skin a satin appearance, and other mysteries of the feminine\r\ntoilet--for the account is a family one, in each case.\r\n\r\nWe have General Proctor, Captain Thomas, Captain Barnes,\r\nCaptain Despard, Colonel Dechambault, Major Courtenay, Captain\r\nCastle, the Hon. Judge Monk, the Hon. William McGillivray, the\r\nHon. Judge Sewell, Major McGregor, Captain Weeks--but, really\r\nthe military march through the pages, as thick as “autumnal\r\nleaves in Vallombrosa.” As for the medical men, their name is\r\nlegion--Doctors Andrews, Arnoldi, Bender, Badgely, Brown, Dillon,\r\nDavis, Cazieu (Chateauguay), Emerson, Ferris, Forsyth, Grassett,\r\nIrving, Kennedy, Kimber, Lee, Morris, McLeod, McGale, Osborne,\r\nNelson, Sleigh, Seilby, Stansfield--and many more. Evidently the\r\npeople did not suffer for lack of medical advice a century ago in\r\nMontreal.\r\n\r\nThe doctors are down, of course, for the ingredients with which\r\nthey compounded their own prescriptions, which was the general\r\npractice of the time.\r\n\r\nWe see that Mr. William Gray, founder of The Herald, had an\r\naccount with Mr. Beckett, while John Kyte, Esq., is indebted\r\nin the sum of £6 8s for a new green coat, and £1 5s for a new\r\nwaistcoat. This might seem incongruous, as drugs and dry goods\r\ndo not mix too well; but in another page we notice that a member\r\nof General Proctor’s household has had a tooth extracted in the\r\nestablishment--thus testifying to the eclectic nature of the\r\nbusiness in that early day, when the departmental store had yet\r\nto be evolved.\r\n\r\nThe Hudson’s Bay Company has an account. The Orkney family got\r\ntheir perfumes and toilet articles from the firm. The Orkney\r\nfamily had a large property facing on St. Catherine Street before\r\nthe latter was homologated--property which extended below Beaver\r\nHall Hill. Many will remember the family mansion, standing\r\nin off the street, near Phillips Square--a big, old-fashioned\r\nresidence in the colonial style, with ample grounds.\r\n\r\nThese itemized accounts touch life in an intimate and\r\nconfidential way. That this ledger should have been preserved\r\nall these years in such good condition, each page telling its\r\nown story of status and pride and mode of living--is remarkable.\r\nIt is also interesting to note the copies of letters which\r\nMr. Beckett transferred to the pages of the ledger from time\r\nto time--letters of business, but showing a perfection of\r\nchirography which would be the despair of the slap-dash writer\r\nof the present day--delicate, spiderylike copperplate, with\r\ndelectable involutions, hinting leisure, and the aesthetic sense.\r\nBy comparison, the horror of the typewriter is intolerable. The\r\nledger is regarded as an heirloom to be carefully preserved by\r\nthe National Drug Company, whose offices are now on St. Gabriel\r\nStreet, though the original firm of Dr. Beckett a century ago,\r\nwas on St. Paul Street.\r\n\r\nBusiness was growing in 1815 and St. Paul Street was flourishing.\r\nIn November of that year, through the exertions of Mr. Samuel\r\nDawson, part of St. Paul Street was lighted by twenty-two lamps,\r\ncosting $7.00 each. Business commenced to pick up after this.\r\n\r\nIn 1816 the principal wholesale firms doing business in Montreal\r\nwere: McGillivray, Thain & Co., otherwise called the “Northwest\r\nCompany;” Forsythe, Richardson & Co., who were agents of the East\r\nIndia Company; Maitlands, Garden & Auldjo; Gerrard, Gillespie,\r\nMoffatt & Co., then agents of the Phoenix Fire Insurance Company,\r\nof London; H. Gates & Co.; Allison, Turner & Co.; Desrivières,\r\nBlackwood & Co.; Blackwood, La Rogue & Co.; Robinson, Masson &\r\nCo.; Hector Russell & Co., also retailing fancy dress goods--the\r\ngreat retail dry goods house of that time; Miller, Parlane &\r\nCo., James Miller left the firm in 1819 and engaged exclusively\r\nin shipbuilding, and was one of the founders of the Allan line\r\nof steamships; James McDougall & Co., merchants and brokers;\r\nHart, Logan & Co.; George Platt & Co., hardware; J. and J.M.\r\nFrothingham, hardware; J.T. Barrett, hardware; Jacob DeWitt,\r\nhardware; Lewis Lyman, druggist, founder of the house of Lyman’s\r\nSons & Co.; Day, Gelston & Co., druggists, Mr. Day being the\r\nfather of the late Judge Day; Wadsworth & Nichols, druggists;\r\nThomas Torrance and John Torrance, both wholesale and retail\r\ngrocers; Bowman & Smith, grocers; Zabdiel Thayer, crockery;\r\nToussaint Peltier, grain merchant; Felix Souligny, do.; McNider,\r\nAird & White, auctioneers; M.C. Culliver & Co., do.; and Bridge &\r\nPenn, ditto.\r\n\r\nMost of these firms did what was then considered a very large\r\nbusiness and many of the men composing them were reputed to be\r\nwealthy. The possession of $25,000 in those days made a rich man,\r\nand $100,000 a very wealthy man.\r\n\r\nThe business needs required a bank and the Montreal Bank was\r\nstarted in 1817 without a charter. This was secured in 1822. Its\r\nstory is told elsewhere.\r\n\r\nIn 1820 John D. Ward built the Eagle foundry on Queen Street and\r\nwith his brothers, Lebbeus and Samuel, provided engines for many\r\nsteamboats on the St. Lawrence. The successor of the firm was\r\nGeorge Brush. In 1821 Sherman & Co. formed a sculptory business.\r\nIts successors were Hyatt & Co., James Mavor and Robert Reid.\r\n\r\nThe first meeting of the committee of trade on April 23, 1822,\r\nindicates another link in the chain of progress of mercantile\r\nsolidarity. This was to become the parent of the present Board of\r\nTrade.\r\n\r\nThe earliest boot and shoe factory was established on St. Paul\r\nStreet in 1824 by Alexander Bell, the founder of the J.T. Bell\r\nCompany of today. Among the first important industries of\r\nMontreal also must be mentioned the hemp factory, established\r\nin 1825 and owned by Mr. J.A. Converse. The Mussen grocery firm\r\nopened in the spring of 1827 with a store in Mrs. Ousteroute’s\r\nbuilding on the south side of St. Paul Street facing Vaudreuil\r\nLane. In 1837 his third location at the corner of Notre Dame\r\nand St. Gabriel streets marks a historic move and one thought\r\ndaring. Hitherto trade had centered on St. Paul and Commissioners\r\nstreets, between Custom House Square and Bonsecours Street, while\r\nNotre Dame, Little and Great St. James, Craig and intersecting\r\nstreets were the residential part of the city. His example was\r\nsuccessful and Notre Dame Street then became the principal retail\r\nstreet of the time. Birks’ famous chemist’s store was opened by\r\nDr. F. Fraser in 1828, to be succeeded by R.W. Rexford and by Mr.\r\nR. Birks in 1846. His famous store was first near the old Albion\r\nHotel from which the stage coaches started, and afterwards at\r\nthe corner of Recollet and McGill streets, and has only recently\r\nbeen demolished to make room for the McGill building. In 1829 the\r\nwholesale dry goods importing firm of J.G. McKenzie & Co. was\r\nfounded, though a legitimate successor of one of the business\r\nventures of Horatio Gates, a merchant of great renown, and one of\r\nthe incorporators of the Bank of Montreal. This year also saw the\r\nbirth of Morton Phillips & Co., a firm of stationers.\r\n\r\nWith the date of 1829 we may associate a note on the Montreal\r\nlines of stages which were conducted as follows: “between\r\nMontreal and Prescott, every week day except Saturday, proprietors\r\nH. Dickerson & Company, St. Paul Street; between Quebec and\r\nMontreal, every week day except Saturday, proprietors H. Dickerson\r\n& Company, of St. Paul Street, and John Cody, Quebec; between\r\nMontreal and Bytown (Ottawa), twice a week, Tuesday and Friday\r\nmorning, proprietor E. Cushing, Haymarket, Montreal; between\r\nMontreal and Albany, twice a week, proprietor, E. Cushing; between\r\nMontreal and Albany, thrice a week, proprietor, John Esinhart &\r\nCompany (St. John).”\r\n\r\nThe railway era started in 1831, when the charter for the first\r\nrailway in Canada between La Prairie and St. John was granted.\r\nAll this was to mean great extension to Montreal business. To\r\nthe date of 1833 is to be attributed the original foundation of\r\nKenneth, Campbell & Co., wholesale druggists, through D. Michael\r\nMcCulloch, Alexander Urquhart, Dr. William McDonald, John Birks\r\n(for Carter, Kerry & Co.), and Johnson & Beers, passing to\r\nKenneth Campbell in 1850.\r\n\r\nAt this time the grocery business of Hudon Hebert, established\r\non St. Paul Street near Jacques Cartier Square since 1839, and\r\nthat of Chaput, Fils, on Youville Place in 1842, mark early\r\nFrench-Canadian enterprise.\r\n\r\nMcGill Street before the ’40s was considered in the country, when\r\nSamuel Mathewson started his present grocery business there. For\r\na long time the street as it grew up was a frowsy affair, till\r\nthe Grand Trunk offices set the way to higher ideals. The street\r\nhas begun its transformation period during the last four years.\r\nMathewson & Co. was established by Samuel Mathewson on May 1,\r\n1834, on St. Paul Street. In 1840 he moved to McGill Street and\r\nwas thought to be moving into the country.\r\n\r\nIt has been found difficult to trace the history of the chief\r\nFrench-Canadian firms. The advent of the Banque du Peuple\r\noriginally established in 1835 as a private bank under the\r\ntitle of Viger, DeWitt & Cie, shows that this portion of the\r\npopulation was becoming financially stronger. In 1843 the Banque\r\ndu Peuple as such was started. The petitioners for incorporation\r\nwere Messrs. Louis Viger, Jacob DeWitt, John Donegani, Pierre\r\nBeaubien, Augustin Tulloch, Hosea Baillou Smith, Ronald Trudeau\r\nand Pierre Jodoin, Esquires, of Montreal; Alexis Sauvageau,\r\nEsquire, of La Prairie; Timothée Franchère, Esquire, of St.\r\nMathias; Joseph Frederick Allard, Esquire, of Chambly; and Alexis\r\nMontmarquet, Esquire, of Carillon. It will be noted that we have\r\nnot treated of the banks and insurance businesses which are so\r\nclosely connected with the commercial growth of the city. These\r\nare treated separately in another place.\r\n\r\nThe state of commerce about this time will appear from the\r\nfollowing scale of vessels and their tonnage, which arrived at\r\nMontreal:\r\n\r\n            No. of\r\n  Date.     Vessels.   Tonnage.\r\n  1832       117       27,713\r\n  1833       137       30,864\r\n  1834        89       20,105\r\n  1835       108       22,729\r\n  1836        93       22,133\r\n  1837        91       22,668\r\n  1838        63       15,750\r\n\r\nOf these vessels and their cargoes, by far the greater part were\r\nfrom England and Scotland. A few came every year from Halifax and\r\nother British ports in North America and sometimes cargoes of\r\ngrain, etc., from other ports in Europe.\r\n\r\nThe state of the store fronts of this period immediately\r\npreceding the Union will afford a picture of the commercial\r\nstreets of the city.\r\n\r\nIn 1839 Mr. H. Greig wrote in his History of Montreal: “Both\r\nin Quebec and Montreal the windows in many of the old stores\r\nand shops are small, not larger than those of ordinary dwelling\r\nhouses, very little calculated for display and not giving\r\nindications of the extensive depositories of goods that may be\r\nfound within.\r\n\r\n“A very great number of the recent shops are elegantly, and some\r\nof them splendidly, fitted up. Perhaps there is in scarcely any\r\npart of the commercial world, either in Europe or America, a more\r\nsuperb or exquisitely finished room, for its size, than the shop\r\nof Mr. McDonald, at the corner of Place d’Armes and Notre Dame\r\nStreet.”\r\n\r\nIf Mr. Greig were only privileged to take a walk along St.\r\nCatherine Street now!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                          CHAPTER XXXVI\r\n\r\n               COMMERCIAL HISTORY SINCE THE UNION\r\n\r\n         THE RISE OF MODERN MANUFACTURES AND INDUSTRIES\r\n\r\n  MONTREAL CENTER OF CANADIAN TRADE--LORD ELGIN’S OPINION OF THE\r\n    CANADA CORN ACT--TRADE DEPRESSION BEGINNING IN 1847--SUGAR\r\n    AND FLOUR INDUSTRIES--THE PANIC OF 1860--A PROSPEROUS\r\n    DECADE--ANOTHER DEPRESSION--THE NATIONAL POLICY--PROSPERITY\r\n    AGAIN IN THE EIGHTIES--ST.

NOTES: PRESIDENTS OF THE BOARD OF TRADE--CENSUS\r\n    (1912) OF MONTREAL MANUFACTURES.\r\n\r\n\r\nTrade at the time of the Union centered at Montreal. Quebec had\r\nbeen left behind. The Canada corn act brought in by Lord Stanley,\r\nthe colonial secretary in Robert Peel’s cabinet, while it\r\ncheapened corn in England stimulated business in Canada, for the\r\nact lowered the duty on Canadian wheat and flour to one shilling\r\nin the quarter upon the condition that Canada should impose\r\na duty of three shillings upon United States wheat. Montreal\r\nbecame the center of its distribution. This success was dashed to\r\ndisappointment by Peel’s bill of 1846, described by Lord Elgin in\r\nwriting to a friend shortly after, as drawing “the whole of the\r\nproduce down the New York channels of communication, destroying\r\nthe revenue which Canada expected to derive from canal duties\r\nand ruining at once mill owners, forwarders and merchants. The\r\nconsequence is that private property is unsalable in Canada;\r\nnot a shilling can be raised on the credit of the province.” To\r\ncrown the disasters in 1847 there was the ship fever in the city.\r\nIn 1848 the depression was continued, followed next year by the\r\nriots over the rebellion losses bill, so that many were ready\r\nin the same year for the annexation to the United States as a\r\ndesperate remedy.\r\n\r\nThe year 1850 was not commercially satisfactory, but remains\r\nbright in the annals of trade on account of a most successful\r\nfair opened in Bonsecours Hall, October 17th, and attended by\r\nfrom 20,000 to 30,000 people. This fair was held in order to\r\nprepare for the great International Exhibition in London in the\r\nfollowing year, and resulted in 200 packages being sent forward,\r\nby which the attention of Great Britain was called to Canada\r\nin a most practical manner. The war between Great Britain\r\nand Russia in 1854, while improving the demand for cereals,\r\ninjuriously affected commerce in Montreal through stringent\r\nEuropean money markets, etc., while American tourists, upon whom\r\nthe retail trader then as now relied for no small portion of his\r\nsummer trade, were deterred from visiting the city through the\r\nprevalence of cholera. This, coupled with the unusually late\r\narrival of the spring importations, resulted in leaving large\r\nstocks on hand.\r\n\r\nIn 1854 the Canada Sugar Refinery business was established by Mr.\r\nJohn Redpath. The late Sir George Drummond was early connected\r\nwith it as general manager.\r\n\r\nAn improvement in business characterized the following year,\r\nwhile the city was thronged in March with visitors to a fair\r\nheld in anticipation of the Paris Exhibition, and which was very\r\nsuccessful. In the same year Montreal was visited by Admiral\r\nBetveze to arrange for closer trade relations between Canada\r\nand France. The reciprocity treaty also of 1855, followed by\r\nthe American Civil war, led to increased activity of trade in\r\nMontreal, her citizens, as well as those of other Canadian\r\ncities, supplying many of the needs of the army of 1,000,000\r\ntaken from pen and plough in those days of trial.\r\n\r\nIn 1858 a torchlight procession of about twenty thousand souls\r\n(including spectators), a general illumination and a military\r\nparade, expressed the jubilation of Montreal over the successful\r\nlaying of the first Atlantic cable. The procession, composed of\r\ntradesmen and handicraftsmen, was a mile long and marched six\r\nabreast.\r\n\r\nIn 1859 the Victoria Tubular bridge was opened, but just before\r\nits completion in 1860, commercial panic struck the country, with\r\ndisastrous effects.\r\n\r\nThe greatest disasters were those in the United States, where\r\nevery bank but one suspended payment; but the calamity was\r\nsympathetically reflected in the Dominion.\r\n\r\nThe Bank of Montreal remained firm, thanks to Mr. Davidson, the\r\ncashier, who carried the Montreal merchants through that black\r\ntime. It may be said that Mr. Davidson founded a school of\r\nbanking.\r\n\r\nManufacturing made great progress in the ’60s, owing to the Civil\r\nwar in the United States taking millions of men from the ordinary\r\nactivities of the country to the battlefields, thus stimulating\r\nCanadians to manufacture sufficient to supply the resultant\r\ndemand.\r\n\r\nIn the decade from 1860 to 1870, the investment in Montreal\r\nindustries leaped from $800,000 to $11,000,000. Just about then,\r\nhowever, a period of depression set in, due to a variety of\r\ncauses.\r\n\r\nChief among these were the inevitable slackening in Canadian\r\noutputs due to production being resumed in the United States,\r\nand the general stress caused by the financial losses incurred\r\nthrough wars both on this continent and in Europe. During this\r\nperiod the manufacturers of Montreal suffered possibly more than\r\nany other body; for the great population and easier developed\r\nnatural resources of the United States, with other contributing\r\nfactors, enabled nearly all lines of goods to be produced there\r\nat a lower cost; and with his goods barred from the States\r\nby high tariffs and his home market thrown open to American\r\nfactories, the Montreal manufacturer suffered from his nearness\r\nto the American border, suffered, perhaps, more acutely than\r\nother Canadians. With the inauguration of the National Policy in\r\n1879 conditions changed materially, and the beginning of 1880\r\nfound business booming again. Meanwhile St. James Street had\r\nbecome the chief business street. Morgan’s Colonial House was at\r\nthe northeast corner abutting Victoria Square. When the head of\r\nthe firm took an idea to open on St. Catherine Street, as yet an\r\nunimportant business thoroughfare, in the present location, it\r\nwas a dangerous move according to the wiseacres, but instantly\r\njustified, being followed by other great departmental stores,\r\nsuch as Murphy’s, Hamilton’s and the rest. Substantial and steady\r\nprogress was made in the ensuing twenty years, the products of\r\nthe various factories doubling in value in each decade. Then came\r\nthe remarkable development of the city, beginning about 1898, and\r\nin the ten years from 1900 to 1910 the production increased from\r\nabout eighty-five million dollars to two hundred millions.\r\n\r\nThe origin of some further of our chief industries may now be\r\nrecorded.\r\n\r\nThe cotton industry originated in the old Hudon Mill at\r\nHochelaga, which was started in 1874. When founded there were\r\nemployed at this mill some three hundred hands, and the buildings\r\nand plant were quite small. As the mill stands today, the ground\r\ncovered is about four times that originally built upon and the\r\nnumber of men employed is upwards of eleven hundred.\r\n\r\nThe four other cotton mills of Montreal, all of which are under\r\nthe ownership or control of the Dominion Textile Company, provide\r\nemployment for between five thousand and six thousand persons\r\nin this city and must therefore be accounted amongst its very\r\ngreatest industries. Some idea of the magnitude of the industry\r\nmay be formed from the fact that the capitalization amounts to\r\n$13,500,000, including bonds. It may be noted in passing that the\r\nDominion Textile Company, the chief offices of which are in this\r\ncity, controls many other mills, some of them at considerable\r\ndistances from Montreal.\r\n\r\nPrior to 1883 there were no metal bridges manufactured in\r\nMontreal or vicinity and practically no structural steel work for\r\nbuildings.\r\n\r\nSince 1883, bridge and structural steel manufacture has developed\r\ngreatly in Montreal. And there are now three large concerns\r\nengaged in this line of business: the Dominion Bridge Company,\r\nLimited, the National Bridge Company, Limited, and the Phoenix\r\nBridge and Iron Works.\r\n\r\nIt is estimated that the combined output of these companies for\r\n1912 was between seventy-five thousand and eighty thousand tons\r\nof bridge and building work, having a value of about four million\r\nand a half dollars.\r\n\r\nIt is also estimated that the number of hands employed in the\r\nshops and offices of these companies is about eighteen hundred,\r\nwith a pay roll of about a million and a quarter dollars.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       NATURAL ADVANTAGES\r\n\r\nOf the great variety of natural advantages for manufacturing\r\npossessed by Montreal, it would be difficult to say which is the\r\nmost important. With cheap transportation, it can assemble raw\r\nmaterial and ship finished product with far greater facility\r\nthan any other city on the American continent. Other cities\r\nhave possibly equally good railway facilities, others have lake\r\ntransportation; and other manufacturing cities, but not many, are\r\nocean ports. No other city on the continent, however, combines\r\nall three advantages.\r\n\r\nCoupled with these, Montreal has an important and rapidly\r\nexpanding tributary territory in the Dominion, for products of\r\nits factories find their way all over Canada; it has a large\r\nclass of skilled labor to draw on; and it commands cheaper power.\r\nEvery requisite for successful manufacturing is found here. The\r\ncheapness with which power can be secured is a very important\r\nfactor and with the development of important hydro-electric\r\nproperties in the immediate vicinity industrial power costs\r\nare likely to be materially reduced in the near future. With\r\nboth ocean and lake navigation at its disposal, Montreal taps\r\nboth the Nova Scotia and the American coalfields and thus has\r\nunlimited supplies of fuel to draw on, which can be delivered\r\nhere at a very low cost. Some of the largest ocean-going bulk\r\ncargo carriers in the world are running between the St. Lawrence\r\nports and the Sydneys, freighting coal here at the lowest figures\r\nachieved anywhere for ocean transportation.\r\n\r\nAs far back as 1859 Sir William Dawson, the principal of McGill\r\nUniversity, referred to Montreal’s position for commerce in words\r\nas apropos today as they were then:\r\n\r\n“In its situation at the confluence of the two greatest rivers,\r\nthe St. Lawrence and Ottawa; opposite the great natural highway\r\nof the Hudson and Champlain valley; at the point where the St.\r\nLawrence ceases to be navigable for ocean ships, and where the\r\ngreat river, for the last time in its course to the sea, affords\r\na gigantic water power; at the meeting point of the two races\r\nthat divide Canada, and in the center of a fertile plain nearly\r\nas large as all England: in these we recognize a guarantee\r\nfor the future greatness of Montreal, not based on the frail\r\ntenure of human legislation, but in the unchanging decrees of\r\nthe Eternal, as stamped on the world he has made. We know from\r\nthe study of these indications that were Canada to be again a\r\nwilderness, and were a second Cartier to explore it he might\r\nwander over all the great regions of Canada and the West, and,\r\nreturning to our mountain ridge, call it again Mount Royal, and\r\nsay that to this point the wealth and trade of Canada must turn.”\r\n\r\nAt this time of writing the industries have grown so numerous\r\nthat the chronological method of relating their rise is\r\nimpossible. We shall present a brief indicaton of their number\r\nand scope besides adding in tabulated form various statistical\r\nfacts which will sum up the variety of the industries engaging\r\nattention in Montreal in 1912. Probably the most important\r\nindustry of the city is the manufacture of clothing, both custom\r\nand factory. Nearly ten per cent of the factory workers of the\r\ncity are engaged in this trade and they furnish two-thirds of the\r\nannual Canadian production.\r\n\r\nBut apart from this industry, manufacuring in Montreal covers\r\na very wide range, embracing the chief Canadian car and engine\r\nmanufactories, structural works, cotton factories, sugar\r\nrefineries, rubber manufactories, rolling mills, cement works,\r\nand leather manufactories. In extent and value of output it\r\neasily heads the list of Canadian cities, having double the\r\noutput of its two nearest competitors, Toronto and Hamilton.\r\nThe extent to which manufacturing is carried on is strikingly\r\nshown by the per capita valuation of its product, which is $360\r\nannually.\r\n\r\nTobacco is a principal single industry, while boots and shoes\r\ncome next in importance. As to textiles, cotton takes the first\r\nplace. Among food products, slaughtering and meat packing rank\r\nwith flour, the largest flour mill in the British Empire being\r\nsituated in Montreal. Of the miscellaneous industries, electric\r\nlight and power and electrical apparatus and supplies are the\r\nchief.\r\n\r\nImmediately outside of Montreal is a large business in iron\r\nand steel products. Among the largest are the Dominion Bridge\r\nCompany’s works at Lachine and the Montreal Locomotive Works and\r\nthe Structural Steel Company’s works at Longue Pointe. Again, in\r\nMontreal are to be found the great car and repair shops of the\r\ntwo chief railways: the Canadian Pacific Railway and the Grand\r\nTrunk Railway System.\r\n\r\nThe city is also the center of several industries, which though\r\nnot actually situated in Montreal, are yet managed from it. The\r\npulp industry is an example, yet there is not actually a single\r\npulp mill in Montreal.\r\n\r\nIn the president’s address to the Canadian Manufacturers\r\nAssociation in September, 1912, it was pointed out that in\r\nthe ten-year period Canadian exports showed an increase of\r\n$110,000,000, while manufactured articles showed an increase of\r\n$683,000,000. Probably no other country in the world can show\r\nsuch a satisfactory record as this. And when it is considered\r\nthat more than one-sixth of all the manufactures in the Dominion\r\ncome from Montreal, the part which the city has taken in this\r\ngreat industrial evolution will be appreciated.\r\n\r\nMontreal is most favourably situated with regard to obtaining\r\ncheap power. Canada is essentially a land of rivers and lakes,\r\nand her water-power is undoubtedly her greatest asset. In 1911\r\nthe total electrical energy developed from Canada’s water-power\r\nwas 1,016,521 horse-power, of which the province of Quebec\r\ndeveloped 300,153 horse-power. At twenty-two tons of coal per\r\nhorse-power per annum, this is the equivalent of about six and\r\none-half million tons of coal. Eighty per cent of the power used\r\nin the province of Quebec is water-power.\r\n\r\nThe wood pulp and paper industry have contributed very largely to\r\nthe development of this kind of industry, but other industries\r\nhave taken advantage of it, such as lumber mills, textile mills\r\nand rubber factories.\r\n\r\nThe following companies supply power in Montreal:\r\n\r\n1. The Montreal Light, Heat and Power Company, Limited, act as\r\ndistributing agents in the City of Montreal for the Shawinigan\r\nWater and Power Company, whose plant is situated at Shawinigan\r\nFalls, on the St. Maurice River, eighty-four miles from Montreal.\r\nThere is a fall of 135 feet, and 107,000 horse-power has been\r\ndeveloped. The electricity is transmitted to Montreal and the\r\nEastern Townships; a large portion supplying the asbestos mines\r\nwith power. Thirty thousand horse-power is used in Shawinigan\r\nitself for the production of aluminum and carbide.\r\n\r\nThe company also obtains power from Chambly on the Richelieu\r\nRiver, and from the Lachine Rapids and the Soulange Canal.\r\n\r\n2. The Montreal Public Service Corporation act as distributing\r\nagents in the City of Montreal for the Canadian Light and\r\nPower Company, which has a plant at St. Timothée, where 30,000\r\nhorse-power has been developed. Electrical and other power is\r\nalso obtained from the Lachine Canal, where there is a total fall\r\nof thirty-five feet, to the extent of 4,642 horse-power. This is\r\nused for flour mills, rolling mills, and many others.\r\n\r\nThere are, in addition, one or two other power plants in process\r\nof development.\r\n\r\nThe manufactures carried on in Montreal are very varied, but of\r\nthese we cannot speak in detail.[1]\r\n\r\n\r\n                 OFFICIAL BUSINESS ASSOCIATIONS\r\n\r\nBefore closing this chapter showing the rise of many of the\r\nindividual conmercial enterprises of our merchants we must refer\r\nto them again in a collective fashion. We have already indicated\r\ntheir combined effort in securing advanced governmental and\r\nmunicipal action. This has been carried on by the great official\r\nbodies or associations of commercial men organized during the\r\nlast few decades of the commercial expansion of the city. The\r\nfirst of such organizations to arise was the Committee of Trade.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       COMMITTEE OF TRADE\r\n\r\n                             (1822)\r\n\r\nEarly in the last century, the merchants of Montreal realized\r\nthat a country’s trade and progress are to be measured by its\r\ntransportation facilities, and that until these are secured,\r\nthere can be little advance. Accordingly, when on July 19,\r\n1821, the first sod of the Lachine Canal was turned by one of\r\ntheir number, the Hon. John Richardson, a vista of a future\r\ninland waterway system and consequent commercial progress was\r\nunfolded. Individual action had prevailed so far, but now the\r\nvalue of union among the merchants was seized upon. A few months\r\nlater, on April 11, 1822, the Hon. John Richardson presided at\r\na preliminary meeting held in the Exchange on St. Joseph Street\r\n(St. Sulpice) of merchants and others interested in commerce,\r\nwhich gave birth to the “Committee of Trade.”\r\n\r\nAt this meeting a resolution was adopted stating “that\r\nthe ruinous consequences now apprehended from the growing\r\nembarrassments of Canadian commerce can no longer be averted or\r\neven delayed by the solitary exertions of individuals or by the\r\noccasional hasty and inadequate deliberations of public meetings,\r\nand that the present alarming crisis demands the establishment\r\nof a standing committee of merchants to be authorized by their\r\nconstituents to watch over the general interests of the trade of\r\nthe country.”\r\n\r\nThe subscription of the members of this organization was placed\r\nat three guineas per annum, and the original subscribers numbered\r\nfifty-four, who elected the following thirteen gentlemen as the\r\nfirst committee of trade: Horatio Gates, George Auldjo, George\r\nMoffatt, Henry McKenzie, Campbell Sweeney, John Forsyth, Peter\r\nMcGill, F.A. Larocque, John Fleming, Samuel Gerrard, Thomas\r\nBlackwood, Charles L. Ogden, James Leslie. This committee began\r\nits operations in a very humble way, for at its second meeting\r\nMr. Auldjo was authorized to finish the proposed agreement\r\nwith Mr. A.L. Macnider for a room for the accommodation of the\r\ncommittee, including fuel and attendance at the rate of thirty\r\npounds per annum. The population of Montreal at this time was\r\n18,767, increasing to 27,997 by 1831.\r\n\r\nFrom the records we possess of this Committee of Trade, it\r\nis clear that Montreal recognized early its vocation as the\r\ncommercial metropolis of Canada, for its rules “authorized\r\nand required the Committee to make to His Majesty and the\r\nLegislature of the United Kingdom, and others in authority, such\r\nrepresentations on Trade matters as might be deemed advisable in\r\nthe defence of such suits as involved the General Trade of the\r\ncountry.”\r\n\r\nThe securing of the construction of the Lachine Canal warranted\r\nthis assumption of authority by the merchants of Montreal, who\r\nwere not unopposed in Upper Canada through mistaken motives of\r\njealousy. The Committee of Trade foreseeing that Montreal was\r\nto become the commercial port of Canada, set to work at once to\r\nencourage large vessels to come to the St. Lawrence. In 1825,\r\nit made strong efforts to induce the Government to deepen the\r\nchannel in Lake St. Peter so that “vessels of nearly 250 tons\r\nburthen, might reach Montreal fully laden during the whole\r\nseason.” It is a far cry from such vessels to the magnificent\r\nsteamers which now perform the service between Great Britain and\r\nMontreal, some of which are nearly fifteen thousand tons.\r\n\r\nSteadily the Committee of Trade began to prepare for the future\r\ndestiny of the port. One of its number, the Hon. James Leslie,\r\npresented in Parliament a petition praying for aid to deepen the\r\nchannel to sixteen feet. In spite of the cholera outbreaks of\r\n1832 and 1834 and the rebellion of 1837 and 1838, the Committee\r\nof Trade went on, until 1839, effecting further improvements.\r\n\r\n\r\n                   THE MONTREAL BOARD OF TRADE\r\n\r\n                             (1842)\r\n\r\nIn April, 1840, when the Union was in the air, at a meeting\r\nunder the chairmanship of the Hon. Peter McGill, the more active\r\nmembers of this committee took steps to reorganize as a Board of\r\nTrade, an act of incorporation being procured in 1841, but as in\r\nthose days all important bills were “reserved,” it was not till\r\nMarch 2, 1842, that the Royal assent was signed by proclamation\r\nand the present Board of Trade came into existence, the number of\r\noriginal members being 106. On April 1st of that year the first\r\nmeeting of the newly incorporated board was held, at which Mr.\r\nJ.T. Brondgeest was elected chairman; Mr. Thomas Cringan, vice\r\npresident; and Mr. J.W. Dunscomb, treasurer.\r\n\r\nThe board under its new name, pursued the same policy as\r\nhitherto. Realizing the value of Montreal’s water position, that\r\nall trade had to follow the waterways and that all the waters of\r\nthe West flowed past Montreal, the merchant members of the board\r\nsecured the fastest ships to Montreal and early controlled the\r\nimport trade. The Lachine Canal had been opened in 1825 and in\r\nthe first decade of the new board they had the satisfaction of\r\nseeing the whole magnificent St. Lawrence system of inland water\r\ncommunication fully opened up through the foresight and initial\r\npush of Montreal merchants.\r\n\r\nIn 1853 the first ocean steamer, the Genova, arrived, the new\r\nchannel having been deepened to fifteen feet two inches and later\r\nto sixteen feet six inches. But in 1854 and 1855 this prosperity\r\nexperienced a check, for during those years no ocean vessel\r\nreached Montreal; its rival, New York, with its navigation open\r\nall the year, had greater attractions for shipping. Trade became\r\nalarmingly bad, but the Montreal merchants were not supine,\r\nthey rose to the occasion and determined to deepen the channel\r\nto twenty feet, and (in 1856) the Allan Brothers came to the\r\nrescue, establishing the Montreal Ocean Steamship Company, which\r\ncommenced a fortnightly service with four steamers. Since then\r\nthe shipping trade has prospered continuously. The Board of Trade\r\nhas continuously urged and secured improvements along the St.\r\nLawrence route, the channel depth having been gradually increased\r\nto thirty feet and a further increase to thirty-five feet has\r\nbeen promised by the Dominion Government.\r\n\r\nA few other activities of the board, which are synonymous with\r\nthose of the representative merchants of the city, may be here\r\nmentioned in connection with the port. The office of port warden\r\nwas established through the board and its work of overseeing\r\nthe loading of vessels sailing from this port has entirely\r\nprevented the sad loss of life and property which at one time\r\nso frequently resulted from the faulty loading of cargo. The\r\nquestion of harbour improvement and development has always\r\nreceived the earnest attention of the board and the council’s\r\nrepresentations to the Government in 1906, urging that instead of\r\neleven commissioners there should be three, were instrumental in\r\nsecuring such reduction. The result of the work of the smaller\r\nboard has exceeded all expectations. The Board of Trade for many\r\nyears agitated for the relief of the Harbour Commissioners from\r\nthe cost of the channel through Lake St. Peter on the ground\r\nthat it was a national work for the national waterway, and\r\nthis agitation resulted successfully, for in 1888 the Dominion\r\nGovernment assumed the debt, which action relieved the Harbour\r\nCommissioners from the burdensome charge for interest on such\r\nexpense. Similarly the board has succeeded in its efforts to\r\ninduce the Dominion Government to free the canals from tolls. But\r\nwhile so much improvement has been obtained, there is at present\r\none most urgent need, viz.: the establishment on the St. Lawrence\r\nof the dry dock now constructed in which the largest vessels\r\ntrading on our river can be repaired in case of emergency.\r\n\r\nMontreal has yet to become a free port. The Board of Trade hopes\r\nthat its ceaseless representations to the Government on this\r\nmatter will ultimately be successful.\r\n\r\nIt would be interesting similarly to trace the efforts of members\r\nof the Board of Trade and other Montreal merchants towards the\r\nprovision of the great railways emanating from our city as their\r\ncenter. Space limit will only allow us to indicate, that when\r\nshortly before the canal system was perfected it began to be\r\nseen that the waterways would not be sufficient to accommodate\r\nthe ever growing trade of Canada, Montreal men faced the railway\r\ntransportation problem and greatly contributed to its present\r\nsuccess. In this they were largely helped by the Grand Trunk\r\nRailway which, originally backed by English money, made splendid\r\nsacrifices for Canada. The Grand Trunk Railway has not always\r\nreceived its just need of appreciation, but it is now a great\r\nnational institution stretching its arms across the Dominion and\r\nreceiving its just reward. The enterprise of Montreal merchants,\r\nis, however, mostly to be discerned in that wonderful system\r\nof railroads, with its headquarters in Montreal--the Canadian\r\nPacific Railway, which, conceived by Canadian brains, was started\r\nby Montreal men and carried out by Canadian executive force and\r\ncapital. Men of wonderful courage, skill and judgment, prominent\r\nmembers of the Montreal Board of Trade, concluded a contract\r\nwith the Government in 1880 to complete the whole road by May 1,\r\n1891. On the 28th of June, 1886, the first through train to the\r\nPacific Coast left Montreal for the Pacific terminus, Vancouver.\r\nOn the first board of directors (1880) of the Canadian Pacific\r\nRailway Company we find the names of Mr. George Stephen (now Lord\r\nMount Stephen), president; Mr. Donald A. Smith (Lord Strathcona),\r\nvice president; Messrs. R.B. Angus, Duncan McIntyre, and C.B.\r\nRose; leading members of the Board of Trade.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the water transportation of the Dominion the\r\nGeorgian Bay Canal prospect has been for some years the object of\r\nthe Board of Trade and on March 14, 1912, a large deputation of\r\nboards of trade and municipal councils urged upon the Dominion\r\nGovernment an immediate commencement of work upon the Georgian\r\nBay Canal.\r\n\r\nThe Premier promised his earnest consideration of the great\r\nquestion involved but said that the Government must have time for\r\na full investigation.\r\n\r\nIn the spring of 1914 an immense delegation organized by the\r\nChambre de Commerce of Montréal also approached the Government to\r\nthe same effect.\r\n\r\nAll praise to the merchants of the Board of Trade, who by their\r\nundaunted push, character and political foresight have written\r\ntheir names in the history of the development of Canada, and have\r\nbound the Mother Country, through Montreal, by bands of steel\r\nand water to the extreme ends of the Dominion. Their influence\r\nextends even further, for it is a matter of record that the\r\ncongresses of the chambers of commerce of the Empire are the\r\nresult of a suggestion made by the Council of the Board. The\r\nlast congress was held in September, 1909, in Sydney, Australia,\r\nwhere the board was represented by Mr. H.B. Ames, M.P., and its\r\nsecretary, Mr. George Hadrill. Nothing but good for Empire trade\r\ncan come of such conventions.\r\n\r\nAgain the Board of Trade looks far and wide. Apart from its\r\npresent trade working relations between South Africa and Mexico\r\nit is looking for a larger and most interesting exchange of\r\nbusiness, for a year ago an Imperial Royal Commission sat in the\r\nboard’s rooms taking evidence regarding the trade between Canada\r\nand the West Indies.\r\n\r\nBy its internal constitution, as we have noticed, the Board of\r\nTrade is ever on the alert watching Dominion, Provincial and\r\nCivic legislation.\r\n\r\nIn the municipal life of the city it has urged improvements in\r\nthe fire service, the water supply, the lighting service and the\r\nbetterment of streets and interested itself in various other\r\nspheres of municipal government reform, among them the securing\r\nof the great modern amendment of the city charter which has\r\nnecessitated the reduction of the number of aldermen to one for\r\neach ward, and the creation of a board of five commissioners for\r\nthe disbursement of money, the awarding of contracts and the\r\npurchase of material.\r\n\r\nIt would be tedious to enumerate further the home activities of\r\nthe Board of Trade, but this feature should not be omitted, viz.:\r\nthat its work has made this city a manufacturing center of ever\r\nincreasing possibilities. Montreal, as a manufacturing center, is\r\nhardly sufficiently advertised; Montreal should be made known not\r\nonly as a gateway for export and import transportation, but also\r\nas the busy center of headquarters of numerous and constantly\r\ngrowing industries of its own. It is a distributing source of\r\ncheap power, light and heat. All that goes towards the making of\r\na great and successful commercial metropolis has been planned\r\nby the merchants of modern Montreal, whose predecessors began\r\nhumbly in 1822, and ever conscious of the future destiny of\r\ntheir city, were always led by visions of its future greatness as\r\nthe commercial metropolis of Canada.\r\n\r\nIt has made representations to the Dominion and Provincial\r\ngovernments on the subject of industrial and technical education\r\nfor the workers and has taken a lofty and ideal stand in more\r\nrecent philanthropical and civic betterment schemes.\r\n\r\nThe Board since 1893 has occupied quarters in its own building,\r\nthough the first building was destroyed by fire on the 23d of\r\nJanuary, 1901. The present building which was entered into in\r\nMay, 1903, while built on the same site and on a similar plan\r\nto the first, is of fireproof construction and, like the former\r\nbuilding, faces on four streets. The board occupies the greater\r\nportion of the fourth floor, its premises consisting of a\r\nhandsome exchange hall, branch association room, reading room,\r\nsecretary’s office, council chamber and committee room. It has a\r\nmembership of 1,400 and there are daily gatherings of various of\r\nits affiliated commercial associations.\r\n\r\nIn addition to being the center of the commercial life of\r\nMontreal, the building has been the locale of several important\r\nsocial functions, the most notable being its inauguration of the\r\nevening of 17th August, 1903, by the Rt. Hon. Lord Strathcona\r\nand Mount Royal, G.C.M.G., which was attended by the members of\r\nthe board and the delegates to the Fifth Congress of Chambers of\r\nCommerce of the Empire (which was held in Montreal that year) and\r\nthe president of the congress, the Rt. Hon. Lord Brassey, K.C.B.;\r\nthe reception of Their Excellencies the Rt. Hon. Earl Grey,\r\nG.C.M.G., and the Countess Grey on the evening of the 24th of\r\nJanuary, 1905, to welcome them on their arrival in this country,\r\nwhich, attended by over twelve hundred guests, was pronounced one\r\nof the most brilliant social functions in the history of the city.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       CHAMBRE DE COMMERCE\r\n\r\n                             (1887)\r\n\r\nThe next great commercial association was the “Chambre de\r\nCommerce,” of French business men. Up to 1886 the Board of\r\nTrade had been alone, though with individual French citizens,\r\nas at present, among its members, but in this year Mr. J.X.\r\nPerrault, not without opposition even among his compatriots,\r\ntook the initiative of forming a second board to group together\r\nFrench-speaking citizens. An act of incorporation was applied\r\nfor from the government at Ottawa and was granted on January 1,\r\n1887. On February 2, 1887, the first reunion of French business\r\nrepresentatives took place under the chairmanship of Mr. Jacques\r\nGrenier, the mayor of the city, and then president of “La Banque\r\ndu Peuple,” in the offices of G.W. Parent, at the corner of St.\r\nLambert and St. James streets. Its few hundreds of members have\r\nnow surpassed a thousand. Its activities are similar to those\r\nof the Board of Trade with which there is mutual cooperation in\r\npoints of common, civic, provincial and federal import. It has\r\ntaken a great interest in the future commercial education of the\r\nmerchant by promoting the “Ecole des Hautes Etudes Commerciales”\r\nrecently erected.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MONTREAL STOCK EXCHANGE BUILDING]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MONTREAL BOARD OF TRADE BUILDING]\r\n\r\n\r\n            CHAMBRE DE COMMERCE FRANCAISE DE MONTREAL\r\n\r\nThere is also at present the “Chambre de Commerce Française de\r\nMontreal” for the promotion of trade by merchants of France\r\nsettled here. It was originally proposed at a meeting in Montreal\r\nof French traders on May 27, 1886, by M.G. Dubail, the Consul\r\nGeneral of France, and on June 26th of that year the projected\r\nconstitution was received for approval. Since then its purpose\r\nof intercommunication and trade relations with France have been\r\nsustained under its presidents.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          OTHER BODIES\r\n\r\nThere is also a Federation of the Chambers of Commerce of the\r\nProvince of Quebec with its offices in this city and among the\r\nmany mercantile bodies now promoting the trade and industries of\r\nMontreal may be mentioned the Montreal branch of the “Canadian\r\nManufacturers’ Association,” the “Montreal Stock Exchange,” the\r\n“Montreal Mining Exchange,” the “Canadian Mining Institute,”\r\nthe “Builders’ Exchange,” the “Corn Exchange Association,” the\r\n“Montreal Business Men’s League,” the “Association Immobiliére\r\nof Montreal,” the “Milk Shippers’ Association,” the “Wholesale\r\nGrocers’ Guild,” the “Wholesale Dry Goods Association,” the\r\n“Metal and Hardware Association,” the “Wholesale Hardware\r\nLeague,” the “Montreal Lumber Association,” the “Montreal Produce\r\nMerchants’ Association,” the “Retail Merchants’ Association of\r\nCanada,” with its office of the Provincial Board for the Province\r\nof Quebec at Montreal, the Province of Quebec Association\r\nof Architects, the “Licensed Victuallers’ Association,” the\r\n“Federation of Licensed Wine and Spirit Dealers of the Province\r\nof Quebec,” the “Dominion Association of Chartered Accounts,”\r\nthe “Canadian Bankers’ Association,” with numerous other trade\r\norganizations, all cooperating and making for the commercial\r\ngrowth of Montreal and Canada.[2] To all these may be applied in\r\ntheir degree the words of tribute spoken at the Board of Trade\r\nbuilding in 1908 by the Governor General Earl Grey:\r\n\r\n  “I am glad to be able to stand here as the representative of\r\n  the King and to signify by my acceptance of your hospitality\r\n  His Majesty’s appreciation of the benefits you, the Montreal\r\n  Board of Trade, have conferred by your energy, by your spirited\r\n  enterprise, and by your imperial aspirations, not only on the\r\n  Province of Quebec and the Dominion, but upon the population of\r\n  the United Kingdom of the whole British Empire. * * * Thanks to\r\n  the brains, energy and public spirit with which your board have\r\n  met the requirements of a trade which is being borne in ever\r\n  increasing volume to your doors, over the continuous bands of\r\n  steel and mighty waterways which you have harnessed to your city,\r\n  the doors of the great treasure house of the West, containing\r\n  illimitable riches, have been unlocked for the benefit of\r\n  impoverished mankind.\r\n\r\n  “I am aware that the proud consciousness of your past\r\n  achievements has not made you indifferent to future improvements\r\n  and that you are still busily engaged in honourable emulation\r\n  of your predecessors, in promoting plans which will increase\r\n  the Commercial strength and prosperity of Montreal and further\r\n  advance the general welfare of the Dominion.”\r\n\r\n\r\n            CHAIRMEN OF COMMITTEE OF TRADE, MONTREAL\r\n\r\n From Its Inception in 1822 to 1841 When It Was Changed into the\r\n                     Montreal Board of Trade\r\n\r\n  1822-25      Thomas Blackwood\r\n  1825-33      George Auldjo\r\n  1833-34      James Miller\r\n  1834-35      T.M.

BANKING\r\n\r\n      THE RISE AND DEVELOPMENT OF THE BANKS OF MONTREAL[1]\r\n\r\nAs Montreal has been for many years the financial center of the\r\ncountry, a considerable part of Canada’s banking history is\r\ncontained in the story of the formation and growth of the city’s\r\nrepresentative banks.\r\n\r\nIt is well known that there was no joint stock bank existent in\r\nBritish North America one hundred years ago.\r\n\r\nThe first attempt was not made in Canada until 1792 when, after\r\nthe conclusion of the Revolutionary war, Montreal’s commercial\r\nimportance was increased through the settlement of the United\r\nEmpire Loyalists in Upper Canada.\r\n\r\nUntil the Loyalists came, there were only a few scattered\r\nmilitary posts in Upper Canada. The new settlers began to clear\r\nthe land and grow crops. Then, as now, the greater part of the\r\nproduce exported by the provinces was sent to England; and the\r\ngreater part of the imports came from the American colonies. The\r\nimports came by the Lake Champlain routes. So Montreal handled\r\nthe inceased exports and imports caused by the settling of the\r\nWestern province.\r\n\r\nIn connection with this trade, and with the other business of the\r\ncity, banking operations were required. These were transacted by\r\nthe English merchants. They took money on deposit, made advances,\r\nand issued due bills which served as currency.\r\n\r\nAll the writers dealing with this period of Montreal’s history\r\nlay much stress on the troubles caused by the lack of circulating\r\nmedium. It should be remembered that the habitants in Lower\r\nCanada had suffered great losses from the issues of paper money\r\nduring the French régime. Their experience with this paper money\r\ncaused them to hoard gold and silver and to distrust paper\r\npromises to pay. Their attitude towards the first bank notes is\r\nsaid to have had a considerable influence in making the banks\r\nhold strong reserves against issues of notes. The currency of the\r\ncountry then consisted largely of French, Spanish and Portuguese\r\ngold coins.\r\n\r\nIn his “Early History of Canadian Banking,” Professor Shortt\r\nhas shown that banking in Canada represented the development\r\nof ideas emanating from Alexander Hamilton, the great American\r\nstatesman. In 1791 the first Bank of the United States was\r\nformed, on a plan constructed by Hamilton. This bank performed\r\nvery valuable services for the young Republic; and it contributed\r\nmost importantly to the development of industry and trade. But it\r\nwas a private concern; and in its work of caring for the business\r\nof the country, it committed the crime of earning satisfactory\r\nprofits for its proprietors. Even in that early day “the people”\r\nexhibited a strong propensity for putting out of business any\r\npublic corporation which had the temerity to earn good profits in\r\nserving them. In the case of the Bank of the United States, its\r\nend was probably hastened by the fact that the greater part of\r\nits capital stock had been purchased by investors in England. At\r\nany rate, in 1811, after twenty years of operation, its affairs\r\nwere liquidated.\r\n\r\nIn 1792, the year after the Bank of the United States was formed,\r\nan attempt was made to launch the “Canada Banking Company,” which\r\nwas to receive deposits, issue notes, discount bills and keep\r\ncash accounts with customers. Professor Shortt says the idea of\r\nthe bank is supposed to have been originated and worked up by\r\nMontreal merchants. The official notice in the Quebec Gazette\r\nis signed by Phyn, Ellice & Inglis, a London firm, and by Todd,\r\nMcGill & Company, and Forsyth, Richardson & Company--Montreal\r\nmerchants, who were customers of the London firm. The Canada\r\nBanking Company was to have its head office in Montreal and\r\nbranches at Quebec and other places. The two Montreal firms here\r\nreferred to had a large share of the trade with the Upper Canada\r\nsettlers.\r\n\r\nThis scheme fell through. Mr. James Stevenson says in his work\r\nthat the promoters succeeded in forming a private bank of\r\ndeposit; and in Sir Edmund Walker’s book it is stated that the\r\ncompany did issue notes, but they doubtless had a very limited\r\nuse.\r\n\r\nUpon the failure of this project, the Montreal merchants\r\nproceeded to develop and extend the business of private banking\r\ncarried on by them in connection with wholesale trade. They gave\r\ncredit for supplies, issued due bills, accepted orders drawn by\r\none party on another, etc.\r\n\r\nIn 1808, while the first Bank of the United States was still\r\nin active business, steps were taken to organize the “Canada\r\nBank.” A bill was introduced in the Legislature providing for a\r\ncapital of £250,000 currency ($1,000,000), the shares being of\r\nthe denomination of £25 currency ($100). This bank was promoted\r\nby a combination of citizens of Montreal and Quebec. It was to\r\nhave twenty-four directors, twelve from Montreal and twelve from\r\nQuebec. Although the Legislature rejected this bill, it was\r\nprinted at the time of introduction. Professor Shortt states that\r\nhe had the opportunity of examining it and comparing it with the\r\ncharter of the Bank of the United States.\r\n\r\n“Allowing,” he says, “for the necessary changes required to adapt\r\nthe American charter to Canadian conditions, the bill reproduces\r\nin a very literal manner every essential feature of the American\r\nAct.” The bank provided for in the bill was naturally on a\r\nsmaller scale than that of the United States. Then he gives in\r\nparallel columns the full number of articles, sixteen in each\r\ncase, applying to the Canadian bank and the American bank. On\r\nperusing them it is quite easy to see that the idea or plan was\r\ntaken bodily from the United States and changed only so much as\r\nto make it applicable to Canada’s position.\r\n\r\nThis new banking scheme formed the subject of much discussion,\r\nin the Legislature and outside of it, for several years. The big\r\nmerchants of Montreal and Quebec had not abandoned their plan,\r\nand were no doubt working for its accomplishment when in 1812\r\nwar broke out between the United States and Great Britain. The\r\nwar served to put an end for the time to the projects for a new\r\nbank. The various writers dealing with this stage of Canada’s\r\nhistory appear to agree in their statements that the maintenance\r\nof considerable bodies of British troops in Canada served to make\r\nbusiness prosperous for the producers and merchants. The troops\r\nconsumed large quantities of produce, which was purchased by\r\nthe Home Government at famine prices. Consequently, exports of\r\nproduce tended to decline. One authority says that about the only\r\nexports passing down the St. Lawrence at this time were bills of\r\nexchange.\r\n\r\nDuring the war the currency troubles were largely removed, too,\r\nthrough the issue of the army bills. These bills were issued at\r\nfirst in denominations of $25 and upwards bearing interest and in\r\nthe denomination of $4 not bearing interest. Afterwards bills of\r\nthe denominations of one, two, three, five, eight, ten, twelve,\r\nsixteen and twenty dollars were added to the non-interest bearing\r\nissues. The large interest-bearing bills could be converted into\r\nsmall bills not bearing interest; and the small bills could be\r\nconverted into large bills subject to interest. The rate of\r\ninterest was 4 pence per £100 per day. Bills were redeemed at\r\nthe option of the commander in cash or bills on London at thirty\r\ndays’ sight at the current rate of exchange.\r\n\r\nWhile these army bills were in circulation there was plenty of\r\ncurrency available for carrying on the country’s business. The\r\ntotal outstanding on March 27th, 1815, was £1,249,996. After the\r\nclose of the war, the issues were rapidly redeemed. A year later,\r\nin April, the outstandings had been reduced to £197,974. At the\r\nend of 1820, all bills had been retired. Their cancellation\r\nbrought back the currency troubles in an aggravated form; and\r\nthe merchants and citizens redoubled their efforts to secure\r\nauthorization of a bank which would transact, deposit exchange,\r\nand discount business, and issue notes to serve as circulating\r\nmedium.\r\n\r\nEven before the army bills were withdrawn and cancelled, the\r\nagitation for a bank was renewed. Early in 1815 a motion was\r\nintroduced in the Lower Canada Legislature to resolve the House\r\ninto a committee of the whole to consider the establishment of a\r\nbank. This came to nothing. At the next session sundry Montreal\r\nmerchants petitioned for incorporation as a bank. The dissolution\r\nof the House on 28th February, 1816, put an end to the bill which\r\nwas framed to give effect to this plan. It was put in again when\r\nthe new House assembled; but before it could be passed the House\r\nwas prorogued. Then, to quote Professor Shortt, “The merchants\r\nof Montreal, who had been chiefly interested in the attempts to\r\nget a bank charter, feeling, no doubt, that the sympathy of the\r\nbusiness community was with them, and that it would be a pity\r\nto lose another year with no more certainty of success, * * *\r\ndecided to start the bank _without a charter_. Accordingly, on\r\nMay 19, 1817, the articles of association of the Montreal Bank\r\nwere adopted, and the corporation proceeded to organize.”\r\n\r\nThe founders of the bank had their articles of association\r\npublished in The Montreal Herald, May 22, 1817. Our authority\r\nstates that he was not able to discover any copy of The Herald\r\nfor that date. But he found that the Quebec Gazette, exactly one\r\nweek later, on May 29th, copied from The Herald an editorial item\r\ncommenting on the new enterprise thus:\r\n\r\n  “In the first page of this paper the articles of the Montreal\r\n  Bank Association are laid before the public. Such an\r\n  establishment has always been a favorite with this journal,\r\n  and we cannot but congratulate the community on the prospect\r\n  of a wonderful change for the better in the agricultural and\r\n  mercantile pursuits of this province. The articles of this most\r\n  laudable association, so far as we are enabled to judge from\r\n  practical experience in our younger years, and from much reading,\r\n  are drawn up with great judgment and wisdom, and seem extremely\r\n  well calculated for our local position. We forbear making any\r\n  remarks on the subject for the present, further than that we wish\r\n  the establishment the utmost success in all its bearings.”\r\n\r\nThese original articles of the Montreal Bank, according to\r\nevidence collected by Professor Shortt, were without doubt\r\nadapted from the proposed charter for the Canada Bank, drawn up\r\nin 1808; and as we have already seen, the articles of the Canada\r\nBank were almost literally copied from the charter of the first\r\nBank of the United States. Just a few months before the Montreal\r\nBank articles were signed--in January, 1817--the second Bank of\r\nthe United States was organized. If more evidence is required to\r\ndemonstrate that our banking system was originally founded on\r\nthe United States model as then existing, it is supplied in the\r\nstatement that one of the officers of the newly created Montreal\r\nBank was sent to New York to study the methods of the American\r\ninstitution, and that one of the first officers of the Montreal\r\nBank was an American experienced in United States banking.\r\n\r\nThe names of the first officers are given as follows: President,\r\nJohn Gray; cashier, Robert Griffin; accountant, H. Dupuy; first\r\nteller, Mr. Stone.\r\n\r\nThe directors, appointed the first year after organization,\r\nwere: John Gray, George Garden, John Forsyth, Horatio Gates,\r\nJames Leslie, George Moffat, F. W. Ermatinger, David David,\r\nAustin Cuvillier, John McTavish, George Platt, Hiram Nichols, and\r\nCharles Bancroft.\r\n\r\nThe Montreal bank directors and officials continued to press for\r\nincorporation. They did not, however, finally secure it until\r\nMay 18, 1822, when the Royal assent was given to the bill passed\r\nby the Legislature for the purpose.\r\n\r\nThe following resumé of its history may be given:\r\n\r\nThe Bank of Montreal opened for business on Monday, 3rd November,\r\n1817, in premises in a building belonging to the Armour estate,\r\nsituated on St. Paul Street, between St. Nicholas and St.\r\nFrancois Xavier streets, with a paid-up capital of $350,000.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1819 the capital was increased to $650,000, and in\r\nthe following year to $750,000. In 1829 the capital was $850,000;\r\nin 1841, $2,000,000; in 1845, $3,000,000; in 1855, $4,000,000; in\r\n1860, $6,000,000; in 1873, $12,000,000; in 1903, $14,000,000; in\r\n1905, $14,400,000; in 1912, $16,000,000.\r\n\r\nIn the first full year (1819) of the bank’s operation, a dividend\r\nwas paid at the rate of 8 per cent per annum, and since then\r\n(with the exception of the years 1827 and 1828, when the bank did\r\nnot pay any dividend), the annual dividends have ranged from six\r\nper cent to sixteen per cent (or say, a dividend of 12 per cent,\r\nwith a bonus of 4 per cent), according to the earnings. But of\r\nlate years 10 per cent per annum has been the rate paid, with a\r\nbonus of 1 per cent in April, 1912.\r\n\r\nAfter 8 per cent had been paid as dividend in 1819, a balance\r\nof $4,168 remained on hand, and was laid aside as a _rest_.\r\nFrom that date of small beginnings the rest has steadily grown.\r\nIn 1825 it was $30,780, going down to $12,064 in the following\r\nyear, and then up again to $107,084 two years later; in 1830 it\r\nstood at $31,360. Five years later it stood at $80,660, reaching\r\n$197,828 in 1837; in 1840 it showed $89,480; in 1850, $120,192;\r\nin 1860, $740,000; in 1870, $3,000,000; in 1880, $5,000,000; in\r\n1883, $5,750,000; in 1884, $6,000,000; in 1900, $7,000,000; in\r\n1908 $12,000,000; and now it stands at $16,000,000, and there are\r\nadditional undivided profits amounting to $696,463.27.\r\n\r\nIn 1903 the Bank of Montreal purchased the assets and business of\r\nthe Exchange Bank of Yarmouth. In 1905 it acquired the People’s\r\nBank of Halifax, in the same way, and in 1907 the People’s Bank\r\nof New Brunswick at Fredericton was also acquired in this way by\r\nthe Bank of Montreal.\r\n\r\nIn 1906 the Ontario Bank having intimated that it was in\r\ndifficulties and would have to suspend, the Bank of Montreal\r\nassumed all its liabilities, and it was subsequently liquidated\r\nwithout loss.\r\n\r\nIn 1863 the Bank of Montreal was appointed Banker in Canada for\r\nthe Canadian Government, and on 1st January, 1893, Mr. E.S.\r\nClouston being general manager at the time, the bank became their\r\nfinancial agent in Great Britain, also.\r\n\r\nOn 4th December, 1911, Sir Edward Clouston resigned the position\r\nof general manager and was succeeded by Mr. H.V. Meredith.\r\n\r\nOther banks followed the establishment of the Montreal Bank.\r\n\r\nNext year, 1818, a company of Quebec merchants organized the\r\nQuebec Bank. On March 17th the articles were ratified and on\r\nthe 18th the books were opened for subscriptions to the stock.\r\nOn September 16, 1822, the Royal assent was given to the bill\r\nincorporating this second bank. Less than two months after the\r\nQuebec Bank’s articles were signed a company of “speculative\r\nAmericans attracted to Canada by the prosperity of the war\r\nperiod,” entered into articles of association under the name\r\nof Bank of Canada. This bank was formed in Montreal to compete\r\nwith the Montreal Bank. It started with a capital of £300,000 as\r\nagainst the Montreal Bank’s capital of £250,000 and the Quebec\r\nBank’s capital of £150,000. Royal assent was given to its bill of\r\nincorporation on September 16, 1822, the same day as the Quebec\r\nBank’s bill was signed.\r\n\r\nThe charters of these two banks followed the lines of the charter\r\nof the Montreal Bank. The Bank of Canada passed out of existence\r\nin a few years.\r\n\r\nThese were the first three chartered banks to be started in\r\nBritish North America. Upper Canada was not far behind in the\r\nmatter of organizing a bank. The Bank of Upper Canada got\r\nits charter in 1821. In 1820, the Bank of New Brunswick was\r\nincorporated; in 1825 the Halifax Banking Company started as a\r\nprivate bank; in 1832 the Bank of Nova Scotia was chartered. Soon\r\nseveral other banks were started in Upper and Lower Canada and in\r\nthe Maritime Provinces.[2]\r\n\r\nIn 1837 the banks experienced very stormy weather. There was a\r\ngreat panic in the United States followed by general suspension\r\nof specie payments. Also business in Canada was completely\r\ndisorganized by the rebellion. In May, 1837, the Lower Canada\r\nbanks suspended specie payments. In the Upper Province the banks\r\ncontinued to meet their liabilities in specie until March of the\r\nnext year. Specie payments were resumed in the United States and\r\nin Lower Canada in June, 1838; but in November another outbreak\r\nin the Lower Province necessitated a second suspension. Finally,\r\npayments were resumed in Lower Canada in June, 1839, and in Upper\r\nCanada four months later. That represents the last occasion on\r\nwhich the Canadian banks have suspended specie payments. For\r\nseventy-three years they have stood up, in fair weather and foul,\r\nmeeting all demands in specie or its equivalent. The American\r\nbanks have suspended generally on four or five occasions since\r\n1837.\r\n\r\nOf the banks now having head offices in Montreal the Bank of\r\nBritish North America is the next to appear on the scene.\r\nThis institution was formed in 1836 by “British capitalists\r\ninterested in the prosperity and commerce of the North American\r\ncolonies,” to quote from “The Canadian Banking System,” by R.M.\r\nBreckenridge. The nominal capital was £1,000,000 sterling; and\r\n£690,000 of the capital paid up and utilized in the business of\r\nthe bank in America. The connections of the British Bank were\r\nin both Upper and Lower Canada, New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, and\r\nNewfoundland. The bank was obliged to procure legislation from\r\neach province or colony. This legislation or authorization was\r\nsecured in 1837 and 1838.\r\n\r\nDoctor Breckenridge mentions that the Nova Scotia Act recites\r\nthat the bank had introduced into that province the system of\r\ncash credits and of allowing interest on deposits, usually\r\nknown as the Scotch system of banking. As it was difficult to\r\noperate the bank under authority of so many different provincial\r\nstatutes, the directors secured a Royal Charter in 1840. In\r\ngranting it, the British Government stipulated that the capital\r\nof £1,000,000 should be fully paid up and that no notes under\r\none pound currency should be issued. This charter also limited\r\nthe liability of the stockholders to the amount of their\r\nsubscriptions. The Bank of British North America thus had a wider\r\nterritorial scope than any of the other banks in Canada. It\r\ngradually increased its power and influence; and in 1867, when\r\nthe Commercial Bank was about to fail, we find that the Bank\r\nof Montreal and the British were regarded as the two big,\r\nstrong banks of the metropolis, able to bolster up the crippled\r\ninstitution if they found it advisable to put forth their\r\nstrength.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SPECIMENS OF MONTREAL’S BANKS]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Bank of Toronto]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Canadian Bank of Commerce]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Bank of Montreal]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Bank of British North America]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Molson’s Bank]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Eastern Townships Bank]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: La Banque Nationale]\r\n\r\nThe next bank appearing on the list with head office in Montreal\r\nis the Molsons. This charter was granted in 1855. The original\r\ncapital was £250,000, authorized, of which £50,000 were to be\r\npaid in before the bank should begin business; and the whole\r\namount was to be paid up in five years. The author of “The\r\nCanadian Banking System” says the Molsons, the Zimmerman Bank,\r\nthe Niagara District, and the Eastern Townships came into the\r\nfield “when the tide of sudden and remarkable prosperity which\r\nfollowed the Reciprocity Treaty of 1854 was beginning.”\r\n\r\nThe Molsons was one of the few banks to take advantage of the\r\nfamous “Act to establish Freedom of Banking,” passed in 1850\r\nby the Legislature of the Province of Canada. Banks taking\r\nadvantage of this act were required to deposit with the receiver\r\ngeneral provincial securities for not less than £25,000 currency,\r\npar value, as security for the redemption of their notes. The\r\nreceiver general would then deliver to the bank an amount of\r\nregistered notes equal to the amount of debenture lodged. The\r\nnotes were marked “Secured by provincial securities deposited\r\nwith the Receiver General.” This represented an attempt to\r\nintroduce to this country the system of bond secured currency\r\nwhich had then been taken up in the United States. The Canadian\r\nGovernment’s action in this matter was prompted in part by the\r\ndesire to improve the market for its issues of debentures.\r\nAt that time the Government resorted to various devices for\r\nconverting the resources of the banks to its own uses.\r\n\r\nThe Bank of British North America also took advantage of the\r\nprovisions of the Free Banking Act as regards note issue. It is\r\nunderstood that the British did so in order to obtain the right\r\nto issue small notes.\r\n\r\nThe charter of the Merchants Bank of Canada was obtained in 1861;\r\nand it began on 9th May, 1864, with a capital of $100,000, Hugh\r\nAllan being the founder and first president. This bank operated\r\nas a local Montreal institution for the first four years, and in\r\n1868 it expanded into an important branch bank through acquiring\r\nthe estate of the Commercial Bank, which failed in 1867, the\r\nfailure following closely after the closing of the Bank of Upper\r\nCanada. The bank thereby acquired a valuable connection in\r\nOntario and placed itself in position to develop with the growth\r\nof that great province.\r\n\r\nIt is interesting to note that between 1867 and 1873 there was\r\nstrong competition in the matter of increasing paid-up capital\r\namong the larger banks. The Bank of Montreal, the Canadian Bank\r\nof Commerce (which had recently been organized in Toronto) and\r\nthe Merchants were particularly active in calling up new stock.\r\n\r\nThe bank return for 30th June, 1867, at Confederation, showed\r\ntwenty-eight banks in existence with total assets of $80,772,834.\r\nAnd at the end of June, 1873, there were thirty-three banks, with\r\nassets of $168,519,746.\r\n\r\nAmong the existing at present Montreal institutions the Banque\r\nProvinciale ranks next to the Merchants in point of age, taking\r\ninto account the fact that it is the successor to Banque Jacques\r\nCartier. The Jacques Cartier was chartered in 1861, the same year\r\nas the Merchants.\r\n\r\nThen comes the Royal Bank--its head office in\r\nMontreal--qualifying it for recognition as a Montreal\r\ninstitution. The great business now controlled by the Royal\r\nBank of Canada had its beginning in Halifax in 1864. According\r\nto the “Historical Sketch” of this bank, by J. Castell Hopkins,\r\na co-partnership institution called the Merchants Bank was\r\nestablished that year with J.W. Merkel as president and George\r\nMaclean as cashier. In 1869 it was transformed into a joint stock\r\ninstitution, and received a charter under the name Merchants Bank\r\nof Halifax. The capital was $300,000, the reserve fund $20,000,\r\nand total assets $729,163. In 1887 the bank opened a branch in\r\nMontreal, Mr. Edson L. Pease as manager. Since then the bank’s\r\nbusiness in this city has rapidly increased. In 1901 the bank’s\r\nname was changed to Royal Bank of Canada, as the business had\r\nassumed nation-wide proportions. And on March 2, 1907, the head\r\noffice was transferred from Halifax to Montreal. Mr. Pease had\r\nassumed the general management in 1900, and the establishment of\r\nthe general manager’s office in Montreal dates from that year.\r\n\r\nLa Banque d’Hochelaga was organized by French-Canadian\r\ncapitalists, and received its charter in 1873.\r\n\r\nThe story of Montreal’s banking institutions would be incomplete\r\nwithout a reference to the Montreal City and District Savings\r\nBank. Although it does not belong to the list of chartered banks,\r\nthe City and District, in the sixty-eight years of its existence,\r\nhas taken a prominent and very useful part in the financial life\r\nof the metropolitan city. It now has fourteen branches in Greater\r\nMontreal; and its total resources are well above the thirty\r\nmillion dollar mark.\r\n\r\nAlso it should be remembered that various other banks, having\r\nhead offices in other cities, have taken a very important part\r\nin the work of developing Montreal on the financial side. This\r\nis shown by the record of branch offices operated in the city.\r\nAccording to Houston’s Bank Directory for December, 1914, the\r\nbanks with head offices in Montreal, and other banks, had branch\r\noffices in the city as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n               BANKS WITH HEAD OFFICES IN MONTREAL\r\n\r\n                                            Offices.\r\n  Banque d’Hochelaga (1874)                    28\r\n  Bank of Montreal (1817)                      17\r\n  Royal Bank of Canada (1869)                  21\r\n  Molsons Bank (1855)                          10\r\n  Montreal City and District (1846)            15\r\n  La Banque Provinciale (1900)                 12\r\n  Merchants Bank of Canada (1864)               8\r\n  Bank of British North America (1836)          3\r\n                                              ---\r\n  Total                                       114\r\n\r\n\r\n                BANKS WITH HEAD OFFICES ELSEWHERE\r\n\r\n                                            Offices.\r\n  Standard (1873)                               1\r\n  Bank of Toronto (1855)                        8\r\n  Canadian Bank of Commerce                     7\r\n  Dominion Bank                                 4\r\n  Quebec Bank (1818)                            5\r\n  Bank of Ottawa                                2\r\n  Imperial Bank of Canada                       2\r\n  Union Bank of Canada (1865)                   5\r\n  Banque Nationale (1860)                       1\r\n  Bank of Nova Scotia                           3\r\n  Sterling Bank of Canada                       1\r\n  Home Bank                                     6\r\n                                              ---\r\n  Total                                        45\r\n\r\nThe Bank of New Brunswick, established in 1820, the oldest of\r\nthe list, existed until 1913 when it was merged with the Bank of\r\nNova Scotia. The Canadian Bank of Commerce is the most important,\r\nthe total of its resources having risen to an equality with the\r\nresources of the Bank of Montreal, and the number of its branches\r\nbeing considerably greater than the number of Bank of Montreal\r\nbranches. The Commerce was incorporated originally as the Bank\r\nof Canada in 1858. From the beginning of Canadian banking,\r\nuntil a comparatively recent period, the Bank of Montreal\r\noccupied a dominating position in regard to the other banks. At\r\nConfederation the Bank of Montreal had roundly one-fourth of the\r\ntotal capital of the banks, and more than one-fourth of the total\r\nassets.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    GROWTH THROUGH ABSORPTION\r\n\r\nLargely by means of amalgamations, the Commerce and the Royal\r\nhave improved their positions relative to the Bank of Montreal.\r\nThe growth of these two banks has been phenomenal. Thus, taking\r\nthe Commerce, the total assets in 1870 were $7,844,681; in\r\n1880 they were $21,435,711; in 1890, $22,596,520; in 1900,\r\n$42,822,799; and in 1912 (September 30th), $242,172,114. Since\r\nthe beginning of the twentieth century the resources have\r\nincreased nearly six fold. In that period it has absorbed the\r\nBank of British Columbia, the Halifax Banking Company, the\r\nMerchants Bank of Prince Edward Island, and the Eastern Townships\r\nBank.\r\n\r\nThe Royal Bank’s phenomenal growth also dates from the end of\r\nthe nineteenth century. As late as 1898 its total assets were\r\nbut $12,681,664; in 1910 they were $92,510,346; and in 1912\r\n(September 30th), they amount to $172,908,661. In the list of\r\nbanks absorbed by the Royal are Banco de Oriente, Santiago, Cuba;\r\nBanco del Comercio, Havana, Union Bank of Halifax, and Traders\r\nBank of Canada.\r\n\r\nThe Bank of Montreal, too, has absorbed several other banks; but\r\nit can be said that it has not augmented its resources in that\r\nmanner to such an extent as its rivals have. In recent years its\r\nabsorptions began with the taking over of the Exchange Bank of\r\nYarmouth in 1903. Afterwards the People’s Bank of Halifax and\r\nthe People’s Bank of New Brunswick were absorbed on successive\r\noccasions. And, of course, the Bank of Montreal acquired a\r\nconsiderable portion of the Ontario Bank’s business through its\r\naction in assuming the liabilities of that institution.\r\n\r\nIn order to show the recent progress of the Canadian banking\r\ninstitutions now in existence, the following table is given,\r\ncomparing them in respect of total assets as at September 30,\r\n1912,[3] and December 31, 1890. The banks are given in order\r\naccording to amount of paid-up capital as at the end of 1890:\r\n\r\n     Bank.            December 31, 1890.

Although Montreal can claim\r\nonly about one-third of these institutions as her own, in the\r\nsense that they have head office in Montreal, yet it is the case\r\nthat the financial development of the city has been promoted by\r\nthe growth of practically all of the banks.\r\n\r\nProbably there is no other country in the world able to show\r\nsuch a record of advancement. In the case of eighteen banks with\r\nresources in 1890 of $215,221,000, the increase has amounted to\r\n$1,225,000,000, or nearly six hundred per cent, in less than\r\ntwenty-two years. Counting in the new banks it can be said that\r\nthe resources at present are seven times the resources possessed\r\nin 1890 by the eighteen banks appearing in the first list.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         BANK CLEARINGS\r\n\r\nThe statistics of bank clearings at the principal centers also\r\nserve to illustrate the financial growth of Montreal and of\r\nCanada. In 1892 there were clearing houses in operation at four\r\ncities--Montreal, Toronto, Halifax and Hamilton. The total\r\nof exchanges for each city in the year ending August, 1893,\r\nwas: Montreal, $602,180,723; Toronto (exclusive of the Bank of\r\nToronto), $326,009,971; Halifax, $59,835,278; and Hamilton,\r\n$38,871,401. The grand total was therefore $1,026,897,373.\r\nMontreal thus had about sixty per cent of the total.\r\n\r\nThe following table shows how the clearing system of the city and\r\nof the country has developed:\r\n\r\n                                  Year Ending\r\n     Clearings.

In ratio of increase the Western cities\r\nfar surpass the Eastern cities. Winnipeg, Vancouver, Calgary\r\nand Edmonton are rushing to the front. Of course, the growth\r\nof the clearings of these secondary centers serves to swell\r\nthe clearings at Montreal and Toronto. Ultimate settlement of\r\ndifferences or balances at the smaller places is made by putting\r\nthrough drafts on the greater centers.\r\n\r\nMontreal stands well up in the list of North American cities in\r\nthe matter of bank clearings, her position being from seventh\r\nto ninth. But, when the clearings of a Canadian city are\r\ncompared with the clearings of a United States city, it should\r\nbe remembered that the existence of the branch system in Canada\r\nhas a tendency, in some respects, to make our figures appear\r\nless. For example, the cheques and items drawn on or payable at\r\nthe Bank of Montreal, Montreal, which the other branches of the\r\nBank of Montreal receive each day, do not figure in the daily\r\nclearings. Each institution clears within itself every day a very\r\nlarge aggregate of transactions.\r\n\r\nThe banks of Canada originating from Montreal now have an\r\ninternational reputation. The greatest financial institutions\r\nand the most famous financiers of Europe and America regard\r\nour leading banks as worthy of their respect. Our banks have\r\nestablished their branches in the United States, Mexico, the West\r\nIndies, Newfoundland, and in England and France; and they do\r\nuseful work in all those countries.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          II. INSURANCE\r\n\r\n                             A. FIRE\r\n\r\nThe Phœnix Fire Company, established in Montreal in 1804, was not\r\nonly the first insurance company in Canada, but it was the first\r\ninsurance corporation to leave England in search of business.\r\nIt was founded by a company of merchants to insure their sugar\r\nwarehouses, and being an innovation, most business houses in\r\nEngland up till then having been composed of partnerships, it\r\nwas severely frowned upon by the “experts.” Seeing that many\r\nBritish firms were desirous of insuring their Canadian property\r\nit decided to establish its office here the better to be able to\r\nhandle such policies. It soon found that there was a good field\r\nfor its activities outside of English owned buildings and its\r\nCanadian office was a flourishing adjunct by the time 1811 was\r\nreached. It was destined to have the field all to itself until\r\n1818, either because it had firmly entrenched itself during this\r\ntime or because Montreal and Canada in those days offered a very\r\nunattractive sphere from an insurance point of view. The Phœnix\r\nin those early days won for itself a splendid reputation and\r\ngrew to be recognized in the light of a bounteous institution by\r\nthe people of Eastern Canada, and today it successfully holds\r\nits own against its younger rivals in the city, while in the\r\ncountry districts, where tradition probably counts for more,\r\nit is a household word and people insure with it for the not\r\ninadequate reason that their fathers and grandfathers did. The\r\nPhœnix Company not only introduced fire insurance to the rank and\r\nfile among our Canadian people, but it encouraged the formation\r\nof fire fighting forces, itself donating engines, the city of\r\nMontreal being a recipient of one of these machines, which put\r\nit in possession of probably the first piece of fire fighting\r\napparatus it ever owned.\r\n\r\nIn 1818 the Phœnix monopoly in Canada was challenged at Quebec\r\nby the Quebec Fire Insurance Company, which was established in\r\nthat year in the Ancient Capital, its formation being the first\r\npractical effort on the part of Canadians to get a share of the\r\nlucrative business which must have been obtainable at that time\r\nfor a corporation operating “on the ground floor” as it were. The\r\nsecond insurance office to be established in Montreal itself was\r\nthe result of the enterprise of the Ætna Fire Insurance Company,\r\na concern which had been constituted in Hartford, Connecticut,\r\nthat birthplace of so many great fire and life institutions, in\r\n1819.\r\n\r\nThese three companies seem to have practically parcelled up the\r\nbusiness of Eastern Canada among themselves until the ’50s, their\r\nonly rivals being several local mutual associations, brought into\r\nexistence probably by Montrealers anxious to secure some of the\r\nwealth that was pouring into the coffers of the Phœnix, Quebec,\r\nand Ætna, but which were doomed shortly to meet a disastrous\r\nfate. In Upper Canada the British America, a Canadian enterprise,\r\nand a branch of the Hartford, had begun operations, the former in\r\n1833 and the latter in 1836.\r\n\r\nThe epochal decades of the ’50s and ’60s saw a tremendous\r\nimpetus given to the fire insurance business in Montreal,\r\nseven great companies commencing careers which have continued\r\nwith uninterrupted success till the present day. In 1851 the\r\nRoyal, the famous English Company, established itself here, as\r\ndid the Liverpool and London and Globe, another great British\r\ncorporation, while the Mutual Fire Insurance Company of the City\r\nof Montreal was inaugurated in 1859. This last-named concern\r\nchanged its title to the Montreal Canada Insurance Company in\r\n1904 and took out a Dominion license, having operated under its\r\nLower Canada charter until that date.\r\n\r\nIn 1854 came a tremendous test for all the companies doing\r\nbusiness here--the big fire which practically wiped out the whole\r\nof the east end of the city. The mutual fire associations, which\r\nhad been eking out a more or less haphazard existence, were\r\nunable to meet the claims made upon them as a result of this\r\nfire and consequently died ingloriously, much to the advantage\r\nof the Phœnix and the Ætna, which settled every claim promptly,\r\nand liberally. The Royal, and the Liverpool and London and Globe\r\nwere also called upon to pay a share of the losses of this\r\ngreat conflagration, which they did at once, though of course,\r\ntheir liability was very small compared to that of the older\r\nestablished companies.\r\n\r\nThe growth of Montreal’s trade and the increase of her population\r\nduring the next decade are reflected in the eagerness with which\r\nBritish houses, which had hitherto done their Canadian business\r\nfrom home, decided to operate from this end. In 1862 the North\r\nBritish and Mercantile Company and the London Assurance opened\r\nhead offices for Canada here, to be followed in 1863 by the\r\nCommercial Union, in 1867 by the Northern Assurance, and in 1868\r\nby the Guardian.\r\n\r\nThe coterie of fire insurance companies then in existence seems\r\nto have been capable of absorbing all the new business that could\r\nbe written quite easily because for fourteen years no other\r\nconcern thought it advisable to enter the Canadian field. It was\r\nin 1882 that the next office was to be inaugurated, that of the\r\nScottish Union and National, the Caledonian opening up here in\r\n1883, while in 1886 another Canadian enterprise, the Manitoba\r\nAssurance, was founded here, its policies being guaranteed by the\r\nLiverpool and London and Globe.\r\n\r\nAfter this the colony of insurance headquarters here was swollen\r\nat regular and short intervals as will be seen from the following\r\nlist of newcomers between 1886 and 1911 (the nationality of the\r\ncompanies being given in parentheses):\r\n\r\nAtlas (British), 1887; Insurance Company of America (United\r\nStates), 1889; Phœnix of Hartford (United States), 1890; Queen\r\n(United States), 1891; Alliance (British), 1892; Law Union and\r\nRock (British), 1899; Ottawa Assurance (Canadian), 1899; Home\r\n(United States), 1902; German American (United States), 1904; St.\r\nPaul Fire and Marine (United States), 1907; Yorkshire (British),\r\n1907; Provincial (British), 1910; Royal Exchange (British), 1910;\r\nContinental Life (United States), 1910; Underwriters at American\r\nLloyds (United States), 1910; and Union of Paris (French), 1911.\r\nSince 1912 three or four small fire companies have retired, but\r\nto offset this, others, to the number of six or eight, have\r\nentered the field.\r\n\r\nA statistical table prepared in 1912 to show Montreal’s\r\npredominant position in fire insurance underwriting in the\r\nDominion and its long lead on Toronto, which is the second city\r\nin Canada in this connection, follows:\r\n\r\n                        Gross\r\n                      Premiums.

LIFE\r\n\r\nThe development of the life insurance business of Canada began in\r\n1846 by the establishment in Montreal of offices by the Scottish\r\nAmicable and Scottish Provident Companies. After doing a fine\r\nbusiness these two corporations relinquished their right to do\r\nnew business in the year 1878. In the meantime, in 1847, the\r\nStandard Life Assurance Company, a Scottish institution, had\r\nentered the Canadian field, operating from a head office in this\r\ncity, the Royal and Liverpool and London and Globe inaugurating\r\nlife departments at the same time as they began to write fire\r\ninsurance from their Montreal office in 1851. In 1857 the ranks\r\nof life companies here were augmented by the appearance on the\r\nscene of the Life Association of Scotland, though this concern\r\nhas written no new business since 1878.\r\n\r\nThe period between 1860 and 1911 is punctuated at intervals with\r\nthe advent of new life corporations in Canada, Montreal being\r\nselected as headquarters for most of them. In 1862 came the North\r\nBritish and Mercantile, and a year later the Commercial Union and\r\nLondon and Lancashire Life.\r\n\r\nEighteen sixty-five may be considered as a banner year for purely\r\nCanadian life insurance underwriting, for the Sun Life, that\r\nsplendid monument to the genius of a number of Montreal men, was\r\nfounded in this year. The same year witnessed the arrival of\r\nthe Hartford Company of Connecticut in this city, this concern\r\nbeing followed the next year by the Ætna and Phœnix Mutual Life\r\ncompanies, and in 1868 by the Connecticut, these three last-named\r\ncorporations also having their headquarters in Hartford. The\r\nPhœnix Mutual and Connecticut relinquished their licenses as far\r\nas new business was concerned in 1878.\r\n\r\nThe Equitable, having its head office in New York City, and the\r\nUnion Mutual of Portland, Maine, also broke ice here in 1868, the\r\nNorth Western Mutual of Milwaukee coming in 1871 and deciding to\r\ndo more new business in 1878. In 1887 the Germania of New York\r\nState, and the New York Life were attracted to Canada and to\r\nMontreal.\r\n\r\nAfter this there was a lull in the formation of new businesses\r\nuntil 1907, when the Prudential Life Insurance Company of Canada\r\nwas constituted, this company afterwards changing its title and\r\nselecting that of the Security Life. In 1908 the Prudential Life\r\nof the United States began to cater for Canadian business from\r\nheadquarters here and in branches elsewhere.\r\n\r\nThe Phœnix, the doyen of fire insurance companies in Canada,\r\ndecided to branch out into life, and launched a department to\r\ndeal with this phase of underwriting in 1910. In this year the\r\nTravellers, a strong Canadian enterprise, was formed. Several\r\nothers not mentioned also intervened.\r\n\r\nSince the above there has been no retirements in life insurance,\r\nbut four or five new companies have been added.\r\n\r\nThe following table indicates that Montreal holds the lead in\r\nlife insurance activity in the Dominion in the same way that it\r\ndoes in the sister sphere of fire:\r\n\r\n                           Gross        Paid      Total\r\n                          Premiums.

They follow:\r\n\r\n  Fire, 17 companies.\r\n  Life, 17 companies.\r\n  Miscellaneous, 21 companies.\r\n\r\nIn the whole of the Dominion the totals for these sections in\r\n1911 were as follows:\r\n\r\n  Fire, 62 companies.\r\n  Life, 49 companies.\r\n  Miscellaneous, 51 companies.\r\n\r\nSix Montreal and three Toronto life companies no longer take new\r\nbusiness.\r\n\r\nAs against the one small branch office of the Phœnix in 1804,\r\nin 1911 Montreal could boast of possessing 141 offices devoted\r\nexclusively to the handling of insurance in one form or another,\r\nand eighty-three agents. No reliable and exact estimate of the\r\nactual number of people who are employed here by insurance firms\r\nand companies is obtainable, but it is safe to put it up in the\r\nthousands.\r\n\r\nIn fire insurance Montreal has been made the headquarters of many\r\nof those great British corporations who occupy an impregnable\r\nposition in the world in fire underwriting, a number of American\r\ncompanies also handling their Canadian connection from this\r\npoint. Several enterprises with a Canadian backing also operate\r\nfrom here, while every fire insurance concern in the Dominion of\r\nany importance is represented in Montreal by agents of influence\r\nor by special managers and staffs.\r\n\r\nCanada has very largely assumed control of its own life insurance\r\nbusiness, and Montreal financiers have always been to the front\r\nin developing this phase of underwriting. Those British and\r\nAmerican corporations which have selected this city as a starting\r\npoint for their Canadian ventures are among the most powerful in\r\nthe world, and have materially assisted in placing Montreal in\r\nthe first place among Canadian cities in the business done in\r\nlife insurance.\r\n\r\nMontreal can also show that it has always lead in that section\r\nof insurance enterprise covered by the term “miscellaneous” and\r\nwhich includes the writing of policies on automobiles, accidents,\r\nemployer’s liability, plate glass, steam boilers, burglary,\r\nsickness, inland transit, sprinkler leakage, titles, live stock,\r\nhail, weather and tornado, etc.\r\n\r\nTo-day the bulked insurance business of Montreal institutions is\r\nprobably the greatest of any one city in the world by reason of\r\nthe fact that most of those influential enterprises which are\r\nsplit up and divided among a number of cities in Great Britain\r\nand the United States have concentrated their head offices for\r\nCanada in this city.\r\n\r\nIt is safe to say that next to the great banking and railway\r\nbusiness done by local institutions more money is handled by the\r\ninsurance companies than by any other group of enterprises.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[1] An article by H.M.P.

PETER--JACQUES CARTIER’S\r\n    DIFFICULTIES--THE GRADUAL DEEPENING OF THE CHANNEL--THE LACHINE\r\n    CANAL IN 1700--ITS FURTHER HISTORY--MONTREAL THE HEAD OF THE\r\n    CANAL SYSTEM OF CANADA.\r\n\r\nFrom a very early age of improvement in the art of navigation\r\nit must have become evident that water carriage was that which\r\npresented the cheapest and most easy mode of transporting\r\nmerchandise from place to place. Accordingly, with some\r\nexceptions, such as occur to all rules, we find that great cities\r\nhave always arisen either upon convenient ports of the sea, or\r\nupon large navigable rivers and inland waters.\r\n\r\nSuch being the case, it is no wonder that the spot on which\r\nMontreal now stands was early chosen for the foundation of a\r\ncommercial city.\r\n\r\nIt is true that the commerce of Canada in the early days was not\r\nsuch as to employ many hands.\r\n\r\nPeltry was for a long period the only traffic to which importance\r\nwas attached, and the cargoes of a few canoes, rich though they\r\nwere in value, required little labour for their transfer to the\r\nhold of the European merchantman, and the market was managed by a\r\nvery few agents of the great houses in France.\r\n\r\nWhile furs were the only exports, the bateau was suited to\r\nthe trade in both directions; but when agricultural exports\r\ncommenced, grain was first sent down before 1800 on the rafts and\r\nin scows or “arks” which were broken up and sold as lumber in\r\nMontreal. Merchandise was at that time carted to Lachine, whence\r\nthe bateaux and Durham boats took their departure (in “brigades”\r\nof five or more boats that their united crews might help one\r\nanother at the rapids) and sailed through Lake St. Louis.\r\n\r\nStill, such as the trade was, Montreal presented a most favorable\r\nsite for carrying it on. Never was a place for shipment and\r\ntranshipment more plainly indicated by natural laws.\r\n\r\nFor hence, more or less, navigable water courses spread out like\r\na fan over hundreds of thousands of miles in the interior, and\r\npermitted the canoe of the Indian trader to penetrate in all\r\ndirections, while on the other hand, a broad and safe river led\r\nto the great ocean.\r\n\r\nWhen the labours of the voyageur and native hunter gave way\r\nbefore the steady toil of the agricultural settler, the\r\nadvantages which had first prompted the selection of Montreal\r\nwere by no means diminished. The articles of export had changed,\r\nbut those by which they were followed could only reach Europe by\r\nwater and could be sent only thence by the same means.\r\n\r\nThe St. Lawrence, however, with all its acknowledged capacity,\r\nwas not without its drawbacks. Foremost was the long winter which\r\nsealed its waters during six months of the year, and next were\r\nthe dangers of navigation of nearly nine hundred miles to the\r\nsea. The first could not be overcome, but the enterprise of the\r\npeople has, to a great extent, done away with the other.\r\n\r\nIn years gone by, when, for instance, Jacques Cartier visited\r\nthe town then upon the site of Montreal, he was compelled by\r\nthe shallowness of the river to abandon his larger vessel and\r\napproach the town by means of his pinnace.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1805 the Trinity House was established by act of\r\nParliament, with important powers relative to the navigation of\r\nthe St. Lawrence.\r\n\r\nThe principal difficulty met with was at Lake St. Peter, over\r\nwhich (prior to 1851) only vessels of 250 tons could pass and\r\ncome up to the wharves of Montreal. As early as 1831, the\r\nattention of the Legislature was directed to the matter. For\r\nten years it was discussed and in 1841 the Board of Works was\r\nauthorized by act to commence operations. At that time there were\r\nonly eleven feet at low water on the lake.\r\n\r\nUp to 1846, some $400,000 had been expended without important\r\nresults. In June, 1851, the Harbour Commissioners, under the\r\nimpulse of Hon. John Young, began dredging, and in November of\r\nthe same year it was deemed a wonderful advance when the City\r\nof Manchester passed down the river, drawing fourteen feet. In\r\n1853 the depth was increased to sixteen feet two inches, and the\r\nbreadth of the channel to 150 feet. Every year saw improvements\r\nmade and by 1869 vessels drawing twenty feet could make the\r\npassage in safety, while today the channel will permit navigation\r\nby vessels drawing thirty feet.\r\n\r\nThis deepening of the channel accompanied and caused a vast\r\nexpansion of the shipping of the city, made more important by\r\nthe establishment of steam navigation. The commerce of Montreal\r\nin the future will always be in direct proportion to the future\r\ndepth of the channel.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          LACHINE CANAL\r\n\r\nBefore the construction of canals the great inland waters were\r\nof but little value to commerce, the only means of reaching them\r\nbeing by the bark canoe or bateau of the voyageur.\r\n\r\nMany still living recollect how Sir George Simpson, Governor of\r\nthe Hudson’s Bay Company, made his annual canoe journeys from\r\nMontreal to the Red River country. Having “sung at St. Ann’s\r\ntheir parting hymn,” the flotilla of canoes ascended the Ottawa,\r\nbreasted the rapids, and after many weary days, by river, lake\r\nand portage, reached Lake Huron and the Sault Ste. Marie, thence\r\nalong the north shore of Lake Superior to Fort William and the\r\nGrand Portage and by Rainy Lake and Lake of the Woods to Fort\r\nGarry.\r\n\r\nWith the self-possession of an emperor he was borne through the\r\nwilderness, and is said to have made the canoe journey to the Red\r\nRiver forty times.\r\n\r\nFor his distinguished management of the Hudson’s Bay Company’s\r\naffairs and for his services to the trade of Canada, Governor\r\nSimpson was knighted. He died in 1860, a man who would have been\r\nof mark anywhere.\r\n\r\nThe Lachine Canal, therefore, is to be closely connected with the\r\nhistory of transportation, seeing that it was the initial stage\r\nof the journey from Montreal, northward.\r\n\r\nThe credit of being the pioneer of the first Lachine Canal is\r\nto be given to the Sulpician Dollier de Casson who, in 1700,\r\nundertook to deepen the Little St. Pierre River and to make it\r\nnavigable for canoes through Lake St. Pierre between Montreal and\r\nLachine and thence to open a cut from the lake to a point on the\r\nSt. Lawrence above the worst part of the rapids.\r\n\r\nThe engineer was Gédéon de Catalogne between whom and Dollier de\r\nCasson a notorial contract was made for the excavation of canal\r\ntwenty-four arpents (about one mile) in length, twelve feet wide\r\nat the surface of the ground and of varying width at the bottom,\r\naccording to the depth of the cutting.\r\n\r\nThe water flowing through the canal was to be at least eighteen\r\ninches deep at the lowest water in the St. Lawrence.\r\n\r\nThe work was begun in 1700. It was apparently never fully\r\ncompleted, though it is very likely that the imperfect channel\r\ncould be used by canoes, for Upper Canada, during the period of\r\nhigh water.\r\n\r\nAbout the year 1780 certain short cuttings with locks available\r\nfor canoes and bateaux were made at few points on the St.\r\nLawrence where the rapids were wholly impassable.\r\n\r\nAs early as the 1795-6 session of the Provincial Parliament,\r\na bill was introduced for the construction of a canal and a\r\nturnpike to Lachine by the Hon. John Richardson.\r\n\r\nIn 1804 was completed a channel three feet in depth along the\r\nshore line of the Lachine Rapids, connecting with short canals\r\nat the Cascades, Split Rock, and Coteau du Lac, which were\r\nprovided with locks eighty-eight feet long and sixteen feet wide,\r\nadmitting of the passage of “Durham boats.”\r\n\r\nIn 1805 the first attempt was made to improve the Lachine rapids.\r\nThe sum of $4,000 was voted to be expended in removing any\r\nobstacles to navigation.\r\n\r\nIt is scarcely necessary to add that the attempt proved futile.\r\nIt had, however, the advantage of making perfectly plain that the\r\nonly means of overcoming these rapids was by the construction of\r\nthe Lachine canal.\r\n\r\nThe necessity of such a work, owing to increased intercourse with\r\nUpper Canada, was obtaining more general recognition; but some\r\nfew years were to elapse before definite steps were taken to\r\ncarry the project into effect.\r\n\r\nThe proceedings of 1805 are worthy of record, as the first\r\npractical attempt at any improvement of the navigation at this\r\nspot.\r\n\r\nThe history of the modern Lachine Canal begins in 1815 when an\r\nappropriation of £25,000 was voted for its construction, but no\r\nsteps were taken until 1819 when a joint stock company was formed\r\nwith a capital of $600,000. Surveys were made and the design\r\nperfected by 1821 when the government took it up as a provincial\r\nundertaking.\r\n\r\nThe work was commenced July 17, 1821, and was completed in 1825\r\nat a cost of $438,404. The first sod was turned by the Hon. John\r\nRichardson.\r\n\r\nIt had seven locks, each 100 feet long, 20 feet wide and with 4½\r\nfeet of water on the sills, but it was inadequate for the wants\r\nof the trade as may be gathered from the following notice from\r\nthe Quebec Gazette of the 3d November, 1831:\r\n\r\n“Public notice is hereby given that the undersigned, and others,\r\nwill apply to the Legislature of this Province as its ensuing\r\nsession for the privilege to form a Joint Stock Company for the\r\npurpose of making a Canal, Locks, and Basins, in such places as\r\nthey may find necessary for a useful navigation from the Lake\r\nof the Two Mountains to the waters of Lachine, and from thence\r\nto the foot of the current St. Mary, with a branch to the port\r\nof Montreal should they think fit, of dimensions not less than\r\nwill admit the passage of such vessels as can pass through the\r\nlocks of the Rideau Canal, and to acquire lands for basins and\r\nwater privileges as may be wanted by the said Company for the\r\nNavigation and the use of the waters thereof.\r\n\r\n      Horatio Gates\r\n      Dr. Arnoldi\r\n      Thomas Phillips\r\n      Andrew White\r\n      Peter McGill\r\n      Joseph Masson\r\n      Jules Quesnel\r\n      J. Bouthillier\r\n      Frs. Ant. La Rocque\r\n      Jos. Logan\r\n  Montreal, 1 October, 1831.”\r\n\r\nThe enlargement was not, however, undertaken until 1843.\r\n\r\nIn 1843-49 it became a “Ship Canal” with five locks, each\r\n200 feet long, 45 feet wide, and nine feet of water, costing\r\n$2,149,128.\r\n\r\nThe enlargement, commenced in 1875, cost $6,500,000 and by this\r\nthe locks were increased to 270 feet in length and 14 feet depth\r\nof water throughout the canal.\r\n\r\nThe Lachine Canal movement also included that for overcoming\r\nthe rapids of the Cedars, the Cascades and the Coteau. These\r\nwere completed in 1871. Since Montreal gave the impulse a canal\r\nsystem has been instituted, so that from Belle Isle at the mouth\r\nof the St. Lawrence via Montreal there is a water communication\r\nby navigable rivers and great lakes to Port Arthur at the head\r\nof Lake Superior, a distance of 2,200 miles, Duluth 2,343, and\r\nChicago 2,272. The number of locks passed from Montreal to Port\r\nArthur is forty-nine.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               II\r\n\r\n              THE DEVELOPMENT OF MONTREAL SHIPPING\r\n\r\n                       A--SAILING VESSELS\r\n\r\nBIRCH BARK CANOE--BATEAU--DURHAM BOAT--SHIPBUILDING IN MONTREAL.\r\n\r\n                        B--STEAM VESSELS\r\n\r\n  JOHN MOLSON’S ACCOMMODATION, 1809--PASSENGER FARES BETWEEN\r\n    MONTREAL AND QUEBEC--PASSAGE DESCRIBED--THE TORRANCES--INLAND\r\n    NAVIGATION--THE RICHELIEU AND ONTARIO COMPANY--THE FIRST UPPER\r\n    DECK STEAMER TO SHOOT THE LACHINE RAPIDS.\r\n\r\n                       C--ATLANTIC LINERS\r\n\r\n  THE ROYAL WILLIAM FIRST OCEAN STEAMER AND PIONEER OF THE\r\n    OCEAN LINERS--ITS CONNECTION WITH MONTREAL--MAIL SERVICE TO\r\n    MONTREAL--THE GENOVA--ARRIVAL IN MONTREAL IN 1853--DINNER TO\r\n    CAPTAIN PATON--THE CRIMEAN WAR--THE MONTREAL OCEAN STEAMSHIP\r\n    COMPANY--THE FIRST CANADIAN ATLANTIC SHIP COMPANY--THE ALLAN\r\n    LINE--EARLY BOATS--MAIL CARRIERS--1861 DISASTERS--SUBSEQUENT\r\n    SUCCESS--THE PRESENT MONTREAL ALLAN SERVICE--THE CANADIAN PACIFIC\r\n    RAILWAY STEAMSHIP LINES--OTHER LINES--THE SHIPPING AND THE WAR OF\r\n    1914--THE GREAT ARMADA.\r\n\r\nThe early navigation apart from the few small sailing vessels\r\nthat would come up from Quebec was confined in great part to the\r\nbirch bark canoe, than which nothing yet has been found more\r\nsuccessful for primitive transportation. These were supplanted\r\nlater by the bateau. In 1679 La Salle, whom Montreal may claim\r\nas one of its earliest citizens, launched the Griffin above\r\nNiagara Falls in which he sailed to Lake Michigan, but previous\r\nto 1790 little else but the bateau or open boat was constructed.\r\nThe bateau which supplemented the birch bark canoe was a large,\r\nflat-bottomed skiff, sharp at both ends, about forty feet long\r\nand six to eight feet wide in the middle, and capable of carrying\r\nabout five tons. It was provided with masts and lug sails,\r\nwith about fifteen feet hoist, an anchor, four oars and six\r\nsetting-poles shod with iron and a crew of four men and a pilot.\r\nWith forty barrels of flour on board it drew only twenty inches\r\nof water. This was a very safe and adaptable vessel.\r\n\r\nThe Durham boat, an improvement on the bateau, was introduced\r\nby the Americans after the War of 1812. They were flat-bottomed\r\nbarges with keel and center board and with rounded bows, eighty\r\nto ninety feet long and nine to ten feet beam, with a capacity of\r\nabout ten times that of a bateau down stream, but in consequence\r\nof the rapids and want of back freight they brought up on an\r\naverage only about eight tons.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       A--SAILING VESSELS\r\n\r\nThe first ships built in Montreal were those constructed by Mr.\r\nDavid Munn, who commenced his operations about the year 1806.\r\n\r\nTwo or three years later he entered into partnership with Mr.\r\nRobert Hunter; the vessels they built were generally from 200 to\r\n350 tons burthen; one, the Earl of Buckinghamshire, was 600 tons.\r\n\r\nJ. Storrow & Co. built two vessels in 1808 and 1809.\r\n\r\nJames Dunlop, in the three following years, built several of 330\r\nto 350 tons burthen each.\r\n\r\nJames E. Campbell, M’Kenzie and Bethune, and James Millar & Co.\r\nalso built a number of vessels generally of about this same\r\ntonnage.\r\n\r\nThere were built in the Province in 1825, 61 vessels; in 1826, 59\r\nvessels; in 1827, 35 vessels; in 1828, 30 vessels, and in 1831,\r\nonly 9 vessels.\r\n\r\nThe Canada Ship Building Company from London began to build in\r\n1828, but finished only two vessels.\r\n\r\nIn 1829 Shay and Merritt took possession of the yard and that\r\nyear built the steamboat British America, 170 feet long, 30-foot\r\nbeam, for John Torrance & Co. as a trader between Montreal and\r\nQuebec; in 1830 the steamer John Bull, 182 feet long, 32-foot\r\nbeam, for John Molson & Co. as a trader between Montreal and\r\nQuebec; the same year the steamboat St. George, 160 feet long,\r\n26-foot beam, for John Torrance & Co.; in 1831 the steamboat\r\nCanada, 175 feet long, 26-foot beam; also the steamboat Eagle\r\nfor Mr. James Greenfield, 140 feet long, 24-foot beam, and the\r\nsteamer Canadian Patriot, 130 feet long, 24-foot beam, for a\r\njoint stock company.\r\n\r\nIn 1833 they built the steamboat Britannia, 130 feet long,\r\n24-foot beam, for John Torrance & Co.; in the same year the\r\nVarennes, 140 feet long, 23-foot beam, for Rasco & Co.; also the\r\nsteamer Montreal, 96 feet long, 18-foot beam, for James Wait.\r\n\r\nIn 1834 was built the ship Toronto of 345 tons for Captain\r\nCollinson, running between this port and London; also the\r\nBrilliant and Thalia, each 472 tons, for James Millar & Co., sent\r\nhome for the Baltic trade.\r\n\r\nIn 1835 the ship Dougles, 348 tons, was built for Captain Douglas\r\nand in 1836 the bark Glasgow, 347 tons, and the bark Thistle, 260\r\ntons, were built for Millar, Edmonstone & Co., and sent home for\r\nWest India trade.\r\n\r\nIn 1837, the bark John Knox, 347 tons, and in 1838, the ship\r\nGypsey, 572 tons, for the same company.\r\n\r\nThe same year--1838--the bark Colburne, 340 tons, and the brig\r\nWetherall, 252 tons, were built for Captain Collinson.\r\n\r\nThe situation of these shipbuilding yards was very favourable,\r\nas the timber was hauled in at once from the St. Lawrence. The\r\nlength of the yard was 200 feet and all conveniences then known\r\nwere at hand for facilitating and completing the work in the most\r\nperfect manner.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        B--STEAM VESSELS\r\n\r\nTo a citizen of Montreal belongs the honour of launching the\r\nsecond steam vessel which navigated the waters of America, and\r\nthe first on the river St. Lawrence.\r\n\r\nIn 1809 Hon. John Molson launched the Accommodation, a steam\r\nvessel of eighty-five feet length.\r\n\r\nWhen eighteen years of age he had come to Montreal in 1782 and\r\nthere he built the brewery. It was from the river bank at the\r\nback of his brewery that he launched his first vessel broadside\r\ninto the river. The early history of steam navigation should\r\nalways remember Molson’s name.\r\n\r\nThe inventor of the application of steam to a marine engine was\r\nWilliam Symington who first constructed, in 1788, a vessel on\r\nLake Delawater, Dumfrieshire. In 1801-2 he completed a tow-boat\r\non the Forth and Clyde canal called the Lady Charlotte of Dundas.\r\n\r\nRobert Fulton obtained drawings of the machinery and constructed\r\nhis Clermont, the machinery being made by Boulton & Watts of\r\nBirmingham, England. The Clermont navigated the Hudson River in\r\n1807.\r\n\r\nJohn Molson now began to equip his Accommodation, fitting it with\r\nengines, also by Boulton & Watts, and launching it in November,\r\n1809. Though it caused him a loss of £3,000 he persevered and his\r\nventure was followed by the Swiftsure in 1811; Lady Sherbrooke,\r\nthe Car of Commerce, and other vessels. These steamboats were a\r\npowerful factor during the War of 1812 in forwarding troops and\r\nsupplies up the St. Lawrence to Montreal. Mr. Molson died in 1836\r\nin his seventy-third year.\r\n\r\nThe first trip, November 3, 1809, of the Accommodation was thus\r\ndescribed by a contemporary writer:\r\n\r\n“The Accommodation shot out into the current and after a voyage\r\nof some sixty-six hours, of which some thirty hours were spent\r\nat anchor in Lake St. Peter, reached Quebec. As might have been\r\nexpected, this vessel created a great deal of excitement, and\r\nthe Quebec Mercury chronicles its arrival thus: ‘On Saturday\r\nmorning at 8 o’clock, arrived here from Montreal the steamboat\r\nAccommodation with ten passengers. This is the first vessel of\r\nthe kind that ever appeared in this harbour.\r\n\r\n“‘She is continually crowded with visitants. She left Montreal\r\nWednesday at 2 o’clock, so that her passage was sixty-six hours,\r\nthirty of which she was at anchor.\r\n\r\n“‘She arrived at Three Rivers in twenty-four hours.\r\n\r\n“‘She has at present berths for twenty passengers, which next\r\nyear will be considerably augmented.\r\n\r\n“‘_No wind or tide can stop her._\r\n\r\n“‘She has seventy-five feet keel and eighty-five feet deck. The\r\nprice for a passage up is nine dollars and eight down, the vessel\r\nsupplying provisions.\r\n\r\n“‘The real advantage attending a vessel so constructed is that a\r\npassage may be calculated on to a degree of certainty in point of\r\ntime, which cannot be the case with any vessel propelled by sail\r\nonly.\r\n\r\n“‘The steamboat receives her impulse from an open double spoked,\r\nperpendicular wheel on each side, without any circular band or\r\nrim.\r\n\r\n“‘To the end of each double spoke is fixed a square board that\r\nenters the water, and a rotary motion of the wheel acts like a\r\npaddle.\r\n\r\n“‘The wheels are kept in motion by steam operating within the\r\nvessel.\r\n\r\n“‘A mast is to be fixed on her for the purpose of using a sail\r\nwhen the wind is favourable, which will occasionally accelerate\r\nher headway.’”\r\n\r\nThe first steamboat advertisement we quote from the Canadian\r\nCourant:\r\n\r\n\r\n                         “THE STEAM BOAT\r\n\r\nwill leave Montreal tomorrow at 9 o’clock precisely for Quebec.\r\nThose wanting to take a passage will make choice of their Birth\r\n(sic) and pay their Passage money before 8 o’clock tomorrow\r\nmorning, that a proper supply of fresh Provision may be provided.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         FARES TO QUEBEC\r\n\r\n  For Passenger             £2--10s--0d\r\n  Child under 11            £1--5s-- 0d\r\n  Servant with birth        £1--13s--4d\r\n  Servant without birth     £1--5s-- 0d\r\n\r\nN.B.--60 lbs. weight will be allowed for each full Passenger, and\r\nso in proportion. Way Passengers are to pay 1s per league and if\r\na meal occurs in the going, not less fifteen leagues, will be\r\ngratis, if less will be charged Two Shillings and Six-pence each\r\nmeal.\r\n\r\n    Montreal, 4th June, 1810.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Accommodation was the first steamer on the river between\r\nMontreal and Quebec. She made her first trip from Montreal\r\nNovember 3, 1809. The Swiftsure followed in 1811, the Car of\r\nCommerce, the Caledonia and others came later, but these early\r\nsteamers landed their passengers and freight at Molson’s wharf\r\nat the foot of the current, and these which first ascended the\r\ncurrent did so with the aid of oxen or horses.\r\n\r\nThe Hercules (a tow-boat) was the first vessel with steam power\r\nand without other aid to ascend St. Mary’s current, with the ship\r\nMargaret in ballast in tow, during the season of navigation in\r\n1824.\r\n\r\nThe well known writer M. de Gaspé, says of traveling between\r\nMontreal and Quebec at this period, 1818:\r\n\r\n“This reminds me of a first voyage from Quebec to Montreal by\r\nsteamer. It was in October of 1818, at 11 o’clock in the evening,\r\nwhen the Caledonia, in which I had taken passage, left the\r\nQueen’s wharf.\r\n\r\n“Between 7 and 8 o’clock on the following morning my companion,\r\nthe late Robert Christie, opened the windows of his stateroom and\r\ncalled out, ‘We are going famously.’\r\n\r\n“We were really progressing well, for we were opposite Pointe\r\nAux-Trembles: aided by a strong wind we had made seven leagues in\r\nnine hours.\r\n\r\n“We arrived at the foot of the current below Montreal on the\r\nthird day, congratulating ourselves on the rapidity of steamer\r\ntrips, nor did we feel humiliated in the absence of favourable\r\nwinds, which did not last more than twenty-four hours, to have\r\nrecourse to the united strength of forty-two oxen to assist us in\r\nascending the current.\r\n\r\n“I acknowledge that the Caledonia deserved to be ranked as a\r\nfirst class steamer of that time, and it was with regret that we\r\nbade adieu to it, after the pleasant time we had on board.”\r\n\r\nAmong the names of those who were chiefly connected with the\r\nintroduction and development of steam navigation in the Province\r\nof Quebec may be mentioned, besides the Hon. John Molson, the\r\nfather of the steamboat enterprise in Canada, those of Messrs.\r\nJohn and David Torrance, who, in 1826, placed the steamboat\r\nHercules on the Montreal-Quebec route, and who were also the\r\nfirst in Canada to branch out into direct trade with the East\r\nIndies and China; and George Bush, in 1834 manager of the Ottawa\r\nand Rideau Forwarding Company, and after 1840 the sole proprietor\r\nof the Eagle Foundry in Montreal.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE EVOLUTION OF THE STEAMSHIP]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Early steam vessel with auxiliary sails]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Allan liner “Alsatian”]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Old style sailing vessel]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Montreal harbor in 1872]\r\n\r\n\r\n                        INLAND NAVIGATION\r\n\r\nThe Canada Steam Ship Lines, Ltd., succeeding the Richelieu and\r\nOntario Navigation Company, had its inception in 1845 when the\r\nRichelieu, a small boat of 125 tons, commanded by M. Sincennes\r\nwho formed the Company, was put on its route between Montreal and\r\nChambly for the transportation of freight and passengers.\r\n\r\nAs this venture proved a success, the Jacques Cartier was built\r\nthree years later and ran between Montreal and Berthier.\r\n\r\nIn 1855 the Company added two greatly improved boats, the\r\nVictoria and Napoleon, 350 tons each, to ply between Montreal\r\nand Quebec. As a result of the keen competition thus produced\r\nthe Torrance Company, which had, prior to this, controlled the\r\nentire traffic of the route, in 1858 sold their boat, the Quebec,\r\nfor $30,000 to the Richelieu Company, which by this time had a\r\ncapital of upwards of $125,000. During 1860-61 two additional\r\nboats, the Columbia and the Europa, were added and the capital of\r\nthe Company considerably added to.\r\n\r\nDuring 1862 the Company was increased by the fusion of\r\nTerrebonne, and l’Assomption and Lake St. Peter Lines with the\r\nRichelieu Company.\r\n\r\nIn 1861 the Montreal, costing $12,000, was placed on the line; in\r\n1863 the Francois Yamaska was added, and in 1864 the Quebec was\r\nconstructed at a cost of $172,000.\r\n\r\nIn 1875 the company line was further enlarged by the taking\r\nover of the line of boats running from Montreal to Toronto and\r\nHamilton.\r\n\r\nThis amalgamation took the name of the Richelieu and Ontario\r\nNavigation Company and had a capital of $1,500,000 and eight\r\nsteamboats. Four more were soon added, the Athenian and\r\nAbyssinian in 1876, the Cultivateur in 1880, and the St. Francis\r\nin 1883.\r\n\r\nFrom 1876 to 1882 the late Sir Hugh Allan was president of the\r\ncompany, succeeded by L.A. Senecal, who died in 1887.\r\n\r\nIn 1895 Louis J. Forget became president of the company.\r\n\r\nJune 21, 1898, the company launched at Toronto, The Toronto, a\r\nhandsome new steel steamer, costing about $250,000. In 1913 the\r\nRichelieu and Ontario became the Canada Steamship Lines Company,\r\nwhich amalgamation controls most of the freight and passenger\r\nboats operating in Canadian waters between the Gulf and the Great\r\nLakes, except the Sincennes, McNaughton Line, which controls the\r\ntowing in the district of Montreal, the Montreal Transportation\r\nCompany, the Hall Forwarding Company and several smaller inland\r\nlines.\r\n\r\nThe Steamer Ontario, Captain Hilliard, was the first upper-deck\r\nsteamer to descend Lachine Rapids, August 19, 1840. Her name was\r\nafterward changed to the Lord Sydenham.\r\n\r\nIt is not recorded that more than one steamer ever succeeded in\r\nascending the rapids of the St. Lawrence River. In November,\r\n1838, the little Dolphin, after four weeks of incessant toil,\r\nwas towed up the Long Sault rapids with the aid of twenty oxen,\r\nbesides horses, capstans and men, added to the working of her\r\nengine--the first and probably the last steamer that will ever\r\naccomplish the feat.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       C--ATLANTIC LINERS\r\n\r\nMontreal can claim some share in the success of the first ship\r\nthat ever crossed the Atlantic under steam. The Royal William was\r\nbuilt in the yards of Campbell and Black in Quebec in 1830-1, the\r\ndesigner being Mr. John Gondie.\r\n\r\nThe ship was launched in the spring of 1831 and towed to Montreal\r\nto receive her machinery, and on being fitted out for sea her\r\nfirst voyage was to Halifax, thence to Boston, being the first\r\nBritish steamer to arrive at that port.\r\n\r\nHer dimensions were: Length, 176 feet; hold, 17 feet, 9 inches;\r\nbreadth outside, 44 feet; breadth between paddle boxes, 28 feet.\r\nShe had three masts, schooner rigged; builders’ measurement,\r\n1,370 tons; with accommodations for sixty passengers. She left\r\nQuebec for London on August 5, 1833, via Picton, Nova Scotia.\r\nThence her voyage was twenty-five days.\r\n\r\nTen days after her arrival she was chartered by the Portuguese\r\nGovernment to enter the service of Dom Pedro. In 1834 she was\r\nsold to the Spanish Government and was converted into a war\r\nsteamer under the name of the Ysabel Segunda and was employed\r\nagainst Don Carlos.\r\n\r\nShe was undoubtedly the pioneer of the great Atlantic liners.\r\n\r\nThe connection of Montreal and the Atlantic Service is now to be\r\ntold.\r\n\r\nThe origin of the Montreal steamboat mail service is indicated\r\nfrom an article by Thomas C. Keeffer, civil engineer, 1863. “On\r\nthe 13th of August, 1852, a contract was entered into between\r\nthe Commissions of Works of Canada and Messrs. McKean, McLarty &\r\nCompany, a Liverpool firm, for a term of seven years, by which a\r\nline of screw steamers of not less than 1,200 tons, carpenter’s\r\nmeasurements, 300 horsepower and capable of carrying 1,000 tons\r\nof cargo, besides coal, for twenty-two days, were to commence\r\nrunning between Liverpool, Quebec and Montreal in the spring\r\nof 1853, one every fortnight during the season of navigation,\r\nand to Portland once a month; the outward passage not to exceed\r\nfourteen days and the homeward passage thirteen days. The maximum\r\nrate of freight to be charged was 60 shillings per ton. Fourteen\r\ntrips were to be made from Liverpool to the St. Lawrence and\r\nback, for which at least five steamers were to be provided; and\r\nfive trips to Portland and back, for which three steamers were\r\nrequired. The vessels were all to be ready and to commence their\r\nfortnightly service on or before the 1st of May, 1854, and a\r\nsufficient number to be ready and to commence the monthly trips\r\nin the spring of 1853. The price to be paid by the province was\r\nfor fourteen fortnightly trips to the St. Lawrence, £1,238--1--11\r\nsterling. The Grand Trunk Railway was to pay £388--6--8 sterling\r\nfor each monthly trip to Portland. In October, 1852, Messrs.\r\nMcKean, McLarty & Company formed a provisional company under\r\nthe title of the Liverpool & North American Screw Steamship\r\nCompany, and petitioned the Board of Trade for a Royal Charter\r\nwith limited liabilities. In this they were vigorously and\r\nsuccessfully opposed by the Cunard Steamship Company (already\r\nmagnificently subsidized by the British government) and generally\r\nby ship owners not protected by a limited liability, and were\r\ncompelled to attempt the formation of their company under a\r\nCanadian charter.\r\n\r\n“Under this contract the Genova, a small steamer of 700 tons and\r\n160 horsepower, was sent out in 1853, the first trans-Atlantic\r\nsteamer which entered the St. Lawrence proper.”\r\n\r\nIt reached Montreal carrying the royal mail on Friday, May\r\n13, 1853, amidst great rejoicing. She was an iron boat from\r\nLiverpool, commanded by Captain Paton.\r\n\r\nOn the evening of her arrival a dinner was given in the Donegani\r\nHotel, the following being the text of the address presented to\r\nCapt. Walter Paton, who with Mayor Wilson and the others sat at\r\nthe banquet:\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“Captain Paton, Sir.--Your arrival in the Port of Montreal in\r\ncharge of the Genova, the pioneer steamer of the Ocean Line, is\r\nan event of too much importance to Canada to be allowed to pass\r\nwithout notice.\r\n\r\n“To mark the sense which the City Council entertains of this very\r\ngratifying token of our Country’s advance, I have been instructed\r\nto welcome you with heartfelt congratulations, and to offer you\r\nthe hospitalities of the City.\r\n\r\n“It is now happily beginning to be understood that the highways\r\nwhich nature has provided for access to the interior Countries,\r\nare usually the shortest and most practicable, and a single\r\nglance at the Map of North America, should convince the most\r\nskeptical that the St. Lawrence, with its chain of lakes, is the\r\ntrue channel for the commerce of the Great West. To divert into\r\nother outlets the products of the vast granaries which skirt our\r\nwaters for thousands of miles, has employed the talents, energies\r\nand resources of our great rival and neighbour, and not without\r\nsuccess.\r\n\r\n“The time, however, is fast approaching when the tide of trade\r\nand travel will take its proper and destined course. Canada\r\nbegins to feel its strength and to value its advantages. Its\r\npupillage has not been altogether misspent. Arrived at the\r\nmaturity which demands self-reliance it is ready to take\r\nits place, as a full grown worker, and little doubt need be\r\nentertained of the vigour which it is prepared to bring to the\r\ntask. What the future of Canada will be, the largest minds have\r\nnot adequately conceived. A knowledge of its unbounded resources,\r\nthe tithe of which has not been developed--an appreciation of its\r\nsalubrious climate, and the essentially liberal character of its\r\ninstitutions offer guarantees to the emigrant for the successful\r\npursuit of competency and happiness which no other country can\r\nexceed.\r\n\r\n“The disturbance of our waters by your gallant vessel is one\r\nof those strong pulsations which indicate the high health of\r\nCanada. And the time cannot be very distant when this pulse will\r\nbeat--not once in the month, but with greatly increased power and\r\nfrequency. Nevertheless, Dear Sir, The Genova and Captain Paton\r\nwill ever be associated in the history of a note-worthy era; and\r\nwhen the first Steamer of the ocean line is referred to, these\r\nnames will stir up the most pleasurable reminiscences. Again,\r\nthen, we hail your advent among us; and we may express the hope\r\nthat your connexion with this enterprize will be sufficiently\r\nprolonged to place you in competition with other rivalries in the\r\nsame honourable strife.”\r\n\r\nThe Genova was followed by the Lady Eglinton, 600 tons and 160\r\nhorsepower, and the Sarah Sands, 1,200 tons and 150 horsepower.\r\nBut these boats only made five trips in 1853. The average voyage\r\nwas fourteen to twenty-two days, home twelve to eighteen days;\r\nand 80 shillings freight instead of 60 shillings was charged. In\r\nconsequence of this total failure on the part of the contractors\r\nthe government of Canada annulled the contract.\r\n\r\nThe Crimean war of 1854 now broke out and no doubt the vessels\r\nwere needed for military transport purposes, so that no new\r\ncontract was made with the firm. This was the great opportunity\r\nwhich was seized upon by the Allan Company, so that on September\r\n28, 1855, a new contract was entered into with Hugh Allan, of\r\nMontreal, to commence in April, 1856, and to give the same time\r\nand number of trips as before, but with vessels not less than\r\n350 horsepower. The subsidy was £24,000 sterling per annum, and\r\na penalty of £1,000 for every trip lost was provided for, the\r\ndeduction of a pro rata amount of the subsidy. The contract\r\nwas terminable by the contractors at the end of any year by\r\ngiving six months previous notice. Although the line was not\r\nremunerative in its first season, 1856, the contract was\r\nfulfilled in the most satisfactory manner, the outward passage\r\nbeing under thirteen days and the home work a little over eleven\r\ndays. The Montreal Ocean Steamship Company was, therefore, the\r\nfirst “Canadian Atlantic steamship company.”\r\n\r\nBut it must not be imagined that this was a brand new firm. It\r\nhad been long connected with the Montreal shipping ventures. The\r\nAllan line dates back to 1822. In that year Capt. Alexander Allan\r\nsailed to the St. Lawrence from Glasgow in the brig Jean--not\r\none-fiftieth of the tonnage of the liners of today, but the first\r\nof the fleet, withal. Captain Alexander was succeeded by his five\r\nsons, Captain Bryce commanding some of the earlier ships.\r\n\r\nHugh Allan arrived as a boy in Montreal, sailing from Greenock\r\nin Scotland with his father on the brig Favorite. We can imagine\r\nthe scene of landing from the state of the development of the\r\nport at that time. Hugh went into business as a bookkeeper to\r\nWilliam Kent & Company, but in 1831 he entered the office of\r\nMessrs. William Edmonstone & Company, ship agents and ship\r\nbuilders. Andrew, his brother, joined him later and they both\r\nmarried sisters, daughters of R. John Smith, a wealthy importer.\r\nThese two brothers represented the Allan line in Montreal, while\r\nGlasgow and Liverpool were served by the three other sons.\r\nMeanwhile the Allan fleet, especially since 1834, had been\r\ngrowing with such ships as the clippers Glennifer, Abeona, the\r\nCorinthian, and their first steamship Sardinian, of which Captain\r\nDutton, a religious-minded but capable seaman, known as “Holy\r\nJoe,” was the commander, afterwards becoming the commodore of the\r\nfleet.\r\n\r\n\r\n               THE ALLAN LINE ROYAL MAIL STEAMERS\r\n\r\nThe firm now owned a fleet of fast sailing vessels of about three\r\nhundred and fifty tons register--full-rigged ships which, with\r\nice-blocks round their bows, pushed their way through the ice, so\r\nthat sometimes they would arrive in port on the 15th of April. In\r\n1853 Mr. Hugh Allan, who was a man of great tenacity of purpose,\r\nand at the same time of remarkable foresight, saw that the time\r\nhad come for the building of iron ships for the St. Lawrence\r\ntrade. Besides, there was the consideration that they would run\r\nto Portland in the winter time, and connect with Montreal by\r\nrail. He enlisted the support of several wealthy men, including\r\nMr. William Dow and Mr. Robert Anderson, of Montreal, and formed\r\nthe Montreal Ocean Steamship Company. The Canadian and Indian\r\nwere the first two boats built by the company.\r\n\r\nThe boats cost about two hundred and fifty thousand dollars each\r\nand had a speed of eleven knots.\r\n\r\nThey were wonders at the time and made a great impression, as\r\nthe people had not been accustomed to see iron ships. Thus it\r\nhappened that when about this time the Crimean war broke out,\r\nand the government was at its wit’s end to provide transports,\r\nthe Allans went into the business, and while the war lasted made\r\nlarge profits.\r\n\r\nThe Canadian Government now made a contract with Mr. Hugh Allan\r\nfor carrying the mails, paying an annual subsidy of $120,000 per\r\nannum. The Anglo-Saxon, a new boat, ran from Quebec to Liverpool\r\nin nine days on one occasion. This was thought to be wonderful,\r\nas the people had been accustomed to a voyage of forty days on\r\nthe old sailing vessels. At that time the ships got 30 cents per\r\nbushel for carrying grain. Contrast this with the 2 cents of\r\ntoday, or the carrying of grain for nothing, as is done by New\r\nYork shipping at certain periods of the year, in order to get\r\nballast on an outgoing trip.\r\n\r\nThe requirements of the service in 1858 demanded more\r\naccommodation, and the Allan brothers determined on a weekly\r\nservice.\r\n\r\nLarger and faster boats were introduced. The government paid\r\nsubsidies to the new service totalling $416,000 per annum. Year\r\nby year the Allans launched new boats, always bigger and faster,\r\nthough speed was never the chief consideration with the company.\r\n\r\nIn 1861 they had a fleet of over twenty vessels; but a sinister\r\nfortune befell the company in the first ten years of its\r\nexistence. Eight ships were lost in as many years.\r\n\r\nIn 1857 the Canadian, in 1859 the Indian, in 1860 the Hungarian\r\nand the second Canadian, and the North Briton in 1861, and later\r\nthe Anglo-Saxon, the Norwegian and the Bohemian--all became total\r\nwrecks. The river was badly lighted. The tides did not run true.\r\nThe pilots were incompetent. The compass deviated, owing to some\r\nstrange local attraction due, it was said, to mineral deposits\r\nin the gulf. Anyway, disaster followed disaster, and, as was\r\nsaid at the time, any other man than Mr. Allan would have given\r\nup in despair. But that gentleman had something of the firmness\r\nof his native granite in his composition, and he never wavered.\r\nDifficulties in time were overcome; the Allans began to prosper\r\nand from this on their boats were singularly free from accidents.\r\n\r\nTo show, however, how little even the most perspicacious can see\r\nin advance of their time, it may be stated that at the banquet\r\nwhich the citizens tendered Mr. Hugh Allan in 1850, he said that\r\nships of 1,700 tons were the most suitable for the Montreal\r\ntrade. He lived to see his boats grow to 5,500 tons.\r\n\r\nThe line prospered; the number of boats was constantly increased\r\nto meet the need; the Northwest was opened up; and the Allan\r\nboats brought in many thousands of immigrants. In addition the\r\ncompany branched out to South America.\r\n\r\nThe building of the Parisian in 1881 was supposed to be about the\r\nlast word in shipbuilding. She was far in advance of anything\r\nto be seen on the route. Today she is, by comparison with the\r\nleviathans of the route, almost as antique as the old Favorite\r\nwas when steamships came in.\r\n\r\nIn 1887, the Canadian Government decided to subsidize a line of\r\nfast steamships. They asked for twenty knots an hour and that\r\nthe vessels should call at a French port. The Allans held that\r\nthe first demand was impracticable, owing to the fact that high\r\nspeed would be dangerous because of the fogs in the gulf; while,\r\nas to the second, it was deemed to be out of the question. The\r\nGovernment played with a tender from another firm, Anderson,\r\nAnderson & Co., of London, which, however, did not make good;\r\nand the fast Atlantic service, in spite of much discussion and\r\ntentative efforts on the part of the Government and the shipping\r\npeople, has never come to anything to this day. The C.P.R.\r\noffered to build a fast service; but the terms were deemed by the\r\ngovernment to be too onerous.\r\n\r\nThe line increased, however, in ships, in business done, in\r\nreputation, both from our own and the American ports.\r\n\r\nMr. Hugh Allan was knighted in 1870. In 1877 he determined to\r\nassociate his name with the C.P.R. enterprise. He, in fact,\r\nformed the first syndicate to build it. The fall of the Macdonald\r\nGovernment defeated his plan.\r\n\r\nHe succumbed to an attack of gout in 1882, at the age of\r\nseventy-two years. His remains were brought out to Canada in one\r\nof his own ships, and laid to rest in Mount Royal Cemetery.\r\n\r\nAlexander Allan died at Glasgow in 1892, leaving a fortune of\r\nthree million dollars. Andrew, so well remembered by Montrealers\r\nfor his public spirit, his identification with good works, his\r\n“canny” Scotch caution, compatible, at the same time, with an\r\nenterprise and boldness in the conduct of his business, died in\r\nMontreal in the ’90s.\r\n\r\nThe business today is carried on by Mr. Hugh A. Allan, chairman,\r\nresident in London, and Mr. Andrew A. Allan, vice chairman,\r\nresident in Montreal.\r\n\r\nThe firm has broadened out in many important ways. It was the\r\nfirst to introduce turbines on the St. Lawrence, and it is still\r\naugmenting the fleet.\r\n\r\nOf the Allan fleet, the steamers on the Montreal-Quebec-Liverpool\r\nservice making the port of Montreal are: Tunisian, 10,576.38\r\ntons; Victorian, 10,629.09 tons; and Virginian, 10,569.62 tons.\r\n\r\nThe steamers on the Montreal and Glasgow line are: Corsican,\r\n11,436 tons; Grampian, 10,900 tons; Scandinavian and Hesperian,\r\n12,100 and 10,900 tons, respectively.\r\n\r\nThose in the Montreal and London service are: Ionian, 8,267.61\r\ntons; Sicilian, 6,229.49 tons; Scotian, 10,490 tons; Corinthian,\r\n6,229.49 tons; and Tunisian, 10,576.38 tons.\r\n\r\nThose in the Montreal and Havre service are: Ionian, 8,267.61\r\ntons; Scotian, Corinthian, Sicilian, 6,229.49 tons; and Tunisian,\r\n10,576.38 tons.\r\n\r\nThe year 1914 also saw the introduction to the Liverpool service\r\nof the Allan Line the new steamers Alsatian and Calgarian,\r\nquadruple screw turbine steamers, ships of 18,000 tons, 21\r\nknots speed, the largest, fastest and most luxuriously equipped\r\nsteamers on the St. Lawrence route.\r\n\r\nAmong the great mercantile fleets of the world no house flag is\r\nbetter known than the red pennant and tri-color of the Allan\r\nLine and none represents to the ocean voyager a greater degree of\r\nsafety and comfort.\r\n\r\nTo the Allan Liner Corsican, Capt. John Hall, belongs the honour\r\nof being the first ocean liner to make the port of Montreal in\r\n1914, arriving here at 12:30 p. m., Wednesday, April 29th.\r\n\r\nFollowing the time honoured custom Captain Hall was presented by\r\nthe Harbour Commissioners with a gold headed cane and a silk hat.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          OTHER FLEETS\r\n\r\nAnother great fleet connected closely with Montreal is that of\r\nthe Canadian Pacific Railway steamship service. The history of\r\nthe inception and development of the railway is told elsewhere.\r\n\r\nThe history of the Canadian Pacific Railway Company, as steamship\r\nowners, dates back for more than a quarter of a century, for it\r\nwas early in 1883 that the company contracted on the Clyde for\r\nthe construction of three steel screw steamships for service on\r\nthe Great Lakes. In 1887 a trans-Pacific service was established,\r\nand in 1889 a car ferry service was put into commission\r\nbetween Windsor, Ontario, and Detroit, Michigan. In 1896 the\r\nC.P.R. bought the Kootenay Navigation Company, and in 1903 was\r\nestablished the British Columbia Coast service. In 1903 also the\r\nAtlantic service was established, and all these services have\r\nbeen extended until as it may be said it is possible to take a\r\ntrip completely around the world on a C.P.R. ticket and never\r\nleave a C.P.R. boat or train.\r\n\r\nIt has also a trans-Pacific and a Mediterranean fleet. The\r\nCanadian Pacific railway steamship service also operates three\r\nfreight boats between Montreal and Avonmouth Dock in summer and\r\nfrom Halifax in winter. In 1906 the Empress of Ireland, which met\r\ndisaster in May, 1914, and the Empress of Britain were put on the\r\nQuebec route.\r\n\r\nThe Elder Dempster line established the South African line in\r\n1902 and in 1905 established the service to Cuba and Mexico.\r\n\r\nThe White Star Dominion established a weekly service in 1909\r\nbetween Liverpool, Quebec and Montreal and the great liners, the\r\nLaurentic and Megantic, appeared at Montreal in the early summer\r\nof that year.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the Thomson & Donaldson lines had long been connected\r\nwith the port under the agency of the Reford Company, so long\r\nconnected with commercial and shipping interests of the port. The\r\nFurness Withy Company, which has its agency here, also have been\r\ntrading for some time between Montreal and Manchester, and the\r\neast coast of England.\r\n\r\nAnother fleet closely connected with Montreal is the Royal Line,\r\nowned and operated by the Canadian Northern Railway Company since\r\n1912, between Montreal and Bristol.\r\n\r\nFor various reasons the Royal Line did not wish to run to\r\nLiverpool, which was already overcrowded with Canadian shipping.\r\nSo they ran to Avonmouth dock instead, and opened up an entirely\r\nnew artery of traffic to the Canadian ports. Before the\r\ninauguration of the Royal Line, no passenger ships of importance\r\nran to Bristol, and naturally the securing of the Royal Line\r\nservice was made an occasion of much rejoicing.\r\n\r\nThe Royal George and the Royal Edward began their trips in 1912.\r\nThese are the only Canadian registered ocean liners. The other\r\nfleets entering the Port are connected with agencies elsewhere\r\nand only enter into the history of the Port inasmuch as they\r\ncontribute largely to its success as a mercantile center.\r\n\r\nThese include the White Star-Dominion, Canada, the Cunard,\r\nthe Monson and Donaldson lines, which the Reford Company so\r\nlong connected with the commercial circles of the city, the\r\nFurness-Withby lines to Manchester, the Elder-Dempster Dominion\r\nlines.\r\n\r\nToday ten big ocean steamship lines now run passenger vessels to\r\nthe port of Montreal, and many smaller lines of coastwise and\r\ntramp traffic swarm the port during the shipping season which\r\nopens in May and closes in November.\r\n\r\nDuring the season of 1912 the Allan Line alone carried 87,159\r\npassengers into and out of Montreal, while the C.P.R., White\r\nStar, Donaldson, Thompson, Cunard, Royal, Elder-Dempster, Canada,\r\nCanadian Northern Railway and Dominion Line boats carried\r\npassengers in proportion.\r\n\r\nDuring the same season the Custom House in the port collected\r\n$15,508,124.53 in duties on foreign made goods imported here.\r\nThese figures take no account of exported goods, goods made in\r\nCanada, or the tremendous grain business which is done each fall,\r\nand to a lesser degree throughout the season. In 1912 125,000\r\ntons of coal were brought into the port of Montreal from the\r\nmines at Glace Bay alone, and 736 ocean-going vessels entered\r\nthe port during the season, showing a total tonnage of 2,403,924\r\ntons, and in wharfage dues, $461,396.43.\r\n\r\nDuring the last two years the Port of Montreal has seen the\r\nadvent of the Cunard Line, originally founded by Mr. S. Cunard of\r\nHalifax, who had the first contract with the British government\r\nfor a fortnightly mail service in 1850 from Halifax to Liverpool\r\nand Boston.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                          CHAPTER XXXIX\r\n\r\n                         TRANSPORTATION\r\n\r\n                                I\r\n\r\n  THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE PORT OF MONTREAL--HERIOT’S DESCRIPTION\r\n    IN 1815--T.S.

At\r\nthe breaking up of the river, the buildings of the town, which\r\nare situated nearest the bank, are sometimes subject to damage by\r\nthe accumulating of ice, impelled by the rapidity of the current.”\r\n\r\nA description of three years later is to be found in a rare\r\npamphlet entitled,\r\n\r\n           THE HARBOUR OF MONTREAL IN 1818 AND IN 1872\r\n\r\n                          By T.S. Brown\r\n\r\nI came to Montreal on the 28th day of May, 1818, in a Bateau from\r\nLa Prairie--no steamer had made the trip at the time--and landed\r\non a sloping, rough beach, exactly where the pier next below the\r\nCustom House runs out to the Island wharf and St. Lambert Ferry.\r\nWhat is now the Island wharf was then a rocky Island separated\r\nfrom the main land by a Channel about one hundred feet wide.\r\n\r\nOn my left was a small brook called the “Creek,” being the\r\ndischarge of a wide open ditch that ran from the Champ de Mars,\r\nthrough Craig Street, round to Inspector Street and then down\r\nCommissioners Street to a stone bridge, crossing at the bottom\r\nof St. Francis Xavier Street. From this till near the river it\r\nran between the wall of a rough stone building, on the site\r\nof the present Custom House, and another wall that supported\r\nCommissioners Street.\r\n\r\nAbove the brook a low narrow wooden wharf ran to Port Street,\r\nCommon Street being supported by a wooden revetment, with gaps\r\nfor sloping roadway to the river.\r\n\r\nAll beyond Port Street was the natural Bank, the same as in the\r\nfront of country villages, except a small wharf opposite the\r\nnorth end of Youville Street, at which point, then called Pointe\r\nà Blondeau, there was a cottage, with garden in front, running\r\ndown to the water.\r\n\r\nHere, too, was a shipyard and the east wall of the Grey Nunnery.\r\nFurther on, all was vacant, except some buildings at the corner\r\nof Grey Nun Street, and beyond here open fields, running up to\r\nPoint St. Charles, with three windmills, the graves of three\r\nsoldiers, shot for desertion, and the Nuns buildings at Point St.\r\nCharles, since used for offices, while Victoria bridge was in\r\ncourse of construction.\r\n\r\nThe Lachine Canal had not been commenced, and distances appeared\r\nso much farther than now, that the river front was divided into\r\n“Pointe à Callière,” “Pointe à Blondeau,” “Windmill Point,” and\r\n“Point St. Charles.”\r\n\r\nDirectly before me was a sloping beach running up to an opening\r\nor street between low houses, forming the east side.\r\n\r\nOn the square, now occupied by the old Custom House, and then by\r\nthe “old Market,” so much frequented by Country people, that they\r\nblockaded the approaches, and had sometimes to be driven away by\r\nconstables to the “new market,” then built on Jacques Cartier\r\nSquare.\r\n\r\nOn my right the natural beach continued down to Hochelaga, or\r\n“the Cross” as it was then called. A wooden revetment held up\r\nCommissioner Street and St. Sulpice Street and thence downward\r\nthere was nothing but the natural bank, on which weeds grew\r\nprofusely. There may have been something more opposite the\r\nBarracks.\r\n\r\nThe buildings fronting on the river were mostly old, low and\r\ndilapidated. A good part of the space was occupied by walls and\r\nmean outbuildings of the houses fronting on St. Paul Street. The\r\nnew buildings were the three-story brick stores just above St.\r\nDiziers Lane, and a three-story store just below.\r\n\r\nThe “spring fleet” mostly in port (a part may have arrived a few\r\ndays later), consisted of, I think, half a dozen brigs of from\r\none hundred and eighty to two hundred and fifty tons burthen,\r\nmoored to the muddy beach; below them were some “Durham boats,”\r\nwhich we should now call small barges, navigators to Upper\r\nCanada, carrying a very large fore and aft sail and top sail.\r\nWind then had to do what is now done by steam. Below these,\r\nopposite the present Jacques Cartier Square, were moored many\r\nrafts--mostly of firewood.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE HARBOR OF MONTREAL]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: General view of sheds]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Grain Elevator No. 2. First entire concrete\r\nelevator in the world. Capacity 2,622,000 bushels]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: King Edward Pier. Vessels loading and unloading\r\ngrain]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Duke of Connaught Pier and Floating Dry Dock.\r\nCapacity 25,000 tons]\r\n\r\nThere were no steamboats, except those running to Quebec, clumsy\r\nthings, with bluff bows, built on the model of sailing vessels,\r\nrigged with bowsprit, high mast and square sail; the deck flush,\r\nand cabins all below.\r\n\r\nTheir steam power was so small that they could not get fifty\r\nmiles from Quebec unless they left with the tide; and oxen were\r\nfrequently used in assisting them up the current, below the city.\r\nAll the structure on the deck of the largest, called the “Car of\r\nCommerce,” was a square house over the stairway, which may still\r\nbe seen, converted into a summer house, with gallery surrounding,\r\nat St. Catherines, that all may notice on the right side of the\r\nroad, when riding round the mountain.\r\n\r\nThere were no tow boats then. Vessels from sea had to make their\r\nway to Montreal by wind which often took a month or more, the\r\nworst being the last mile where I have seen oxen used on a tow\r\nline, as otherwise the light winds would be insufficient to\r\nenable them to overcome the force of the strong current.\r\n\r\nThe “ship” of the period was the Everetta from London, which\r\narrived some days after, and summer goods were advertised about\r\nthe middle of June, there being no way of getting Spring and\r\nSummer “fashions” earlier, so that our ladies were always one\r\nyear behind the age.\r\n\r\nI have in my possession a bill of lading of goods by this ship,\r\ndated 25th of March, 1800. She brought the supplies to the\r\n“Northwest Company,” which then carried on the great Indian\r\nTrade, from Montreal, by canoes, up to Lake Superior, and onwards.\r\n\r\nThe Ship remained moored at the foot of St. Sulpice Street all\r\nsummer, till the canoes returned with the year’s catch of furs,\r\nand carried them to England.\r\n\r\nA traveller quoted by Mr. Sandham in “Ville Marie” as visiting\r\nthe city in 1819 thus describes the activity of the water side:\r\n\r\n“We crossed the river in a canoe hollowed out of a single log,\r\nand on landing we climbed a steep and slippery bank, and found\r\nourselves in one of the principal streets of the city.”\r\n\r\n“In the morning” continues the account “we witnessed a scene of\r\nconsiderable activity, caused by the carts and horses which are\r\ndriven into the river as far as possible to obtain wood, etc,\r\nfrom the boats, and as they go out so far, the body of the cart\r\nis sometimes out of water and the larger sticks are drawn out\r\nwith a rope.”\r\n\r\nIt would be hard to imagine a more hopeless outlook than existed\r\nin the Harbour of Montreal, as indicated on Bouchette’s plan of\r\n1824. The first Lachine Canal was only completed in 1825, having\r\na depth over the sills of 4½ feet, and is not shown on that plan.\r\n\r\nTwo stone windmills marked the progress of industrial development\r\nto the westward of what is now McGill Street. They were situated\r\non top of the open beach.\r\n\r\nThe Grand Trunk Railway Company’s elevator now stands on the site\r\nof the water front of 1824.\r\n\r\nA small wharf 200 feet long existed, providing a depth of water\r\nof 9 feet, in the position of the flood wall opposite the present\r\nHarbour Commissioners’ office.\r\n\r\nAnother irregular wharf known as Berthelette’s Wharf existed\r\nbetween the Harbour Commissioners’ office and the Custom House.\r\n\r\nFrom the Little River, now the Custom House, downward, the beach\r\nwas unimproved except by the construction of sloping roadways\r\ndown to the water.\r\n\r\nShallow water, even points of exposed rocks, existed two-thirds\r\nof the distance across to St. Helen’s Island, in the early days\r\nbefore the Moffatt’s Island Wharf was built.\r\n\r\nThe size and type of the vessels trading to Montreal may be\r\nimagined from the fact that Lake St. Peter limited the draft to\r\n11 feet, and even that depth was not available at any of the\r\nwharves in the Harbour.\r\n\r\nThe shipping trade of a whole season, eighty years ago, could\r\nhave been carried in one or two of the modern ships which now\r\nfrequent the port.\r\n\r\nSloping roadways down to the water where the river was so low\r\nas to permit of rocks showing above the current, a long stretch\r\nof beach where the children of those days romped and played,\r\nand the poorer women washed the linen using the big stones as\r\nwashing boards, a long unbroken line of trees and shrubberies\r\npast Maisonneuve, where now the Harbour Commissioners’ powerful\r\nlocomotives transport merchandise from vessels of 15,000 tons\r\nregister to the various railway terminals, these were the\r\nfeatures of the Port of Montreal long before Confederation had\r\never been dreamed of. In those days inland navigation commenced\r\nat Lachine. Goods for Upper Canada were carted to Lachine and\r\nfrom there taken up the Haldimand Canals in bateaux about\r\nthirty-five feet long and 5½ feet beam, built of the type of a\r\nmodern raft boat with pointed bow and stern.\r\n\r\nFrom 1824 to 1892 the development of the port progressed but\r\nslowly. Still, in the early days the development of the harbour\r\nwas a very live question and it was on the 8th of May, 1830, that\r\nGeorge Moffatt, Jules Quesnel and Capt. Robert S. Piper, R.E.,\r\nwere appointed commissioners under the Great Seal of the Province\r\nof Lower Canada and signed by His Excellency the Governor at the\r\nCastle of St. Louis; for the purpose of carrying into effect an\r\nAct of the Provincial Legislature, 10 and 11, Geo. IV., Cap. 28:\r\n“An Act to provide for the Improvement and Enlargement of the\r\nHarbour of Montreal.”\r\n\r\nThe first works undertaken were for the construction of wharves,\r\nramps, slips for Durham boats, a revetment wall and a bridge to\r\nOyster Island, which was to be the principal wharf.\r\n\r\nIn their first annual report the commissioners, who were called\r\nthe Corporation of the Trinity Board of Montreal until 1855 when\r\nan act was passed changing the name to the Harbour Commissioners\r\nof Montreal and increasing the number of commissioners from\r\nthree to five, stated that they confidently anticipated that the\r\nwharves undertaken, when completed, would be superior to any\r\nworks of the kind in the Province, and would enable the City of\r\nMontreal to be advantageously contrasted with any other in North\r\nAmerica for beauty, solidity and convenience of approach by\r\nwater, and the present Harbour of Montreal rather justifies the\r\nmodest boast of the commissioners of eighty years ago.\r\n\r\nWriting in 1839, before the improvements had been made in the\r\nharbour by the commissioners, Mr. Newton Bosworth in “Hochelaga\r\nDepicta” quotes a New York traveller, who, on landing from\r\na bateau which brought him from La Prairie, thus afterwards\r\nexpressed himself:\r\n\r\n“The approach to Montreal conveyed no prepossessing idea of the\r\nenterprise of its municipality; ships, brigs and steamboats lay\r\non the margin of the river at the foot of the hill, no long line\r\nof wharves, built of the substantial free stone of which there is\r\nan abundance in the very harbour affording security to vessels\r\nand profit to owners; the commercial haven looked as ragged and\r\nas muddy as the shores of Nieu Nederlandt when the Guede Vrow\r\nfirst made her appearance off the battery.”\r\n\r\n“Now,” remarks Mr. Bosworth in 1839, commenting on this “if\r\nhe were to repeat his visit he would be constrained to make a\r\ndifferent report, and find himself able to step ashore without\r\nmore trouble than in walking across a room.”\r\n\r\nThe appropriation for the first three years amounted to $4,000,\r\nwhile at present the Harbour Commissioners have undertaken a\r\nseries of improvements which are soon to be completed at an\r\napproximate cost of $6,000,000.\r\n\r\nDuring the past ten years no less than thirty-eight million\r\ndollars has been expended to improve the local harbour and ship\r\nchannel, nearly one-half of which immense sum has gone towards\r\nthe establishment of harbour and terminal improvements.\r\n\r\nMillions of dollars have been spent on lighthouses, light ships,\r\nsubmarine bell stations, whistling buoys, the dredging of the\r\nmain ship channel from 27½ to 30 feet at low water, its widening\r\nand straightening have been carried out at a cost of $14,000,000,\r\nthe reorganization of the pilotage system has cost $140,000,\r\nthe establishment of fifteen land telephone stations between\r\nQuebec and Montreal has involved the expenditure of $150,000,\r\nwhile hundreds of thousands of dollars have been spent for other\r\nimportant projects.\r\n\r\nSince 1830 some of the best Engineers in Canada, the United\r\nStates and Great Britain, have from time to time been called upon\r\nto investigate and submit plans for improvements.\r\n\r\nMessrs. Gzowsky, Keefer, Forsythe, Trautwine, Legge, Nish, and\r\nSlippell all submitted plans up to 1873.\r\n\r\nA picture of the results of the improvements during the\r\nintervening period is to be found in Mr. T.S. Brown’s retrospect,\r\nalready quoted.\r\n\r\n“I visited it (the harbour)” says the same writer, “at the end of\r\nfifty-four years, on the 28th of May, 1872. And what did I see?[1]\r\n\r\n“A canal of the largest dimensions coming in at Windmill Point,\r\nand the old fields converted into basins, filled with steamers,\r\nschooners and barges, one side fringed by manufactories, and the\r\nother by lofty warehouses, and platforms filled with merchandise.\r\n\r\n“From ‘Pointe à Blondeau,’ or Grey Nun Street, to the Barracks,\r\nthere is a high stone revetment wall, supporting Commissioners\r\nStreet, with Ramps at convenient distances, leading to a broad\r\nplatform or wharf running down to below the barracks and\r\nDalhousie Square, along which is a track for Railway Cars, and\r\nfrom which project many piers, one connecting with the Island\r\nbefore mentioned, and others lower down, extending further out.\r\n\r\n“This platform or line wharf, and the piers, are covered and\r\nfilled with merchandise, of all discriptions, in bars, bundles,\r\ncasks, cases, boxes and bales, a part being covered with\r\ntemporary sheds.\r\n\r\n“The quantity and weight is so immense that one wonders where it\r\ncomes from, and where it goes to, but the immense mass extending\r\nalong Harbour and Canal for a mile, is but a small portion of\r\nwhat is passing into or through the port, for while countless\r\ncarts and cars, are daily removing from one side, steamers and\r\nships fill up every space by discharging on the other, with steam\r\npower and regiments of laborers. The taking in of the cargo is\r\ngoing on at the same time and elevators alongside the ships are\r\ntaking from propellors alongside from the west and far west\r\nthousands of bushels of grain. Instead of the half a dozen brigs\r\nof 1818, with an aggregate tonnage of twelve to fifteen hundred\r\ntons discharging slowly with skids on a rough beach, there lays\r\none steamer that will measure more than the whole put together.\r\n\r\n“In all there is in port, stretched along the wharves and piers\r\nfrom Grey Nun Street to below the Barracks, 21 Ocean Steamers,\r\n22,612 tons; 20 Ships, 17,710 tons; 22 Barques, 12,409 tons; 3\r\nBrigs, 760 tons; 4 Brigantines and Schooners, 278 tons, in all 70\r\nVessels with an aggregate tonnage of 53,769 tons.\r\n\r\n“The shore (I have often seen it bare), below the foot of St.\r\nSulpice Street has been dredged and wharfed to accommodate ships\r\ndrawing twenty feet of water. A Quebec Steamer, not stumpy,\r\nlow and flush deck, but long, built on a skiff model, with two\r\nstories of staterooms raised above the deck, is at a pier at\r\nthe bottom of Jacques Cartier Square, stretching out beyond the\r\nlimits of the old firewood rafts, brought down by farmers from\r\nChateaguay and neighbouring regions, to be sold in June, when\r\nthey were impatient to get home, for $2.00 a cord.\r\n\r\n“Directly below is a fleet of ‘Market Boats,’ really elegant\r\nsteamers, of modern build, that navigate to all ports down to\r\n‘Three Rivers.’\r\n\r\n“Mixed with these are a fleet of ‘Wood Barges,’ rigged on the\r\nprinciple of a ‘Chinese Junk’ (which some of them resemble on a\r\nsmall scale), with a very high mast, and very long square-sail\r\nyards.\r\n\r\n“These bring up firewood, hay, grain, lumber, etc., from below, a\r\ntrade little dreamed of in old times.\r\n\r\n“Further down are piles of boards, planks, and other lumber, and\r\nships being loaded with it for the South Atlantic, or perhaps\r\nPacific, and work is in progress for continuing the wharves to\r\nHochelaga where I have seen many ships launched.\r\n\r\n“Where stood the ‘Mansion House’ (in 1818 our great hotel), a\r\nformer residence of Sir John Johnson, and dwelling houses with\r\nsmall gardens, there is now the Bonsecour Market. The old walls\r\nand sheds, along the ‘front’ to ‘Pointe à Calliêre,’ are replaced\r\nby tall warehouses. An elegant Custom House on the Pointe\r\nreplaces an old potash store. Other warehouses are built on the\r\nold ship yard, and the Grey Nuns having removed to their new\r\nestablishment on Guy Street, their buildings are disappearing,\r\nSt. Peter Street being continued to the harbour by cutting\r\ndirectly through their old church.\r\n\r\n“Such was the aspect of the harbour of Montreal in 1818, and\r\nsuch it is today (1872) and I sincerely hope this article may be\r\npreserved to be republished half a century hence, accompanied by\r\na description of the harbour as it then was.”\r\n\r\nTo continue the story of the developments of the harbour for the\r\ngreater part of fifty years. In 1875 Mr. Robert Bruce Bell, Major\r\nGeneral Newton and Mr. Sanford Fleming drew up a report and plan\r\nfor the improvement of the Habour. Mr. John Kennedy, for so many\r\nyears Chief Engineer of the Harbour Commissioners, has not only\r\ndesigned but carried out many of the improvements now existing.\r\n\r\nTen years ago there was no Alexandra Basin or wharf to speak of,\r\nthere was no level harbour front, no permanent sheds, over a\r\ndozen of which have only been finished within the past four years.\r\n\r\nMagnificent concrete wharves with corrugated iron sheds built on\r\nsolid concrete foundations have been built opposite the plants of\r\nsome of Montreal’s largest industries.\r\n\r\nThe Harbour Commissioners’ tracks pass behind the sheds affording\r\ndirect communication all over the harbour, while excellent\r\nwharfage facilities permit of the circulation of any amount of\r\ntraffic.\r\n\r\nThe greatest addition to the port in recent years, however,\r\nand urged by the Montreal Board of Trade since 1887, has been\r\nthe huge floating dock, the “Duke of Connaught,” which was\r\nsuccessfully towed across the Atlantic in the fall of 1912.\r\nIt was dedicated by H.R.H., the Governor General on 18th of\r\nNovember, 1912.\r\n\r\nH.R.H. the Governor General in replying to the Commissioners’\r\naddress well said that “by the arrival and installation of this\r\ngreat floating dock, the great reproach against the St. Lawrence\r\ntrade route has been removed, and the largest vessels can now run\r\nup to Montreal, secure in the consciousness of entering a port\r\nwhich is in possession of a competent modern equipment for repair\r\nand examination.”\r\n\r\nThe dock is capable[2] of accommodating vessels of Olympic size\r\nor larger and necessitates the employment of a staff of 500 men,\r\nthe majority of them skilled workmen. The dock can accommodate\r\nthirty vessels at present operating on the St. Lawrence route\r\nwhich are too wide of beam to be taken into any existing dock\r\nbetween here and Halifax, 1,000 miles away.\r\n\r\nA ship building plant which is to be operated in connection with\r\nthe dock is to give employment to about two thousand men.\r\n\r\nThe type of Port of Montreal is a combination of a protected\r\ntidal basin, riverside quays and pier jetties.\r\n\r\nThere is no rise and fall of tide, but the river level fluctuates\r\nto an extent of about 12 feet from high water in the spring to\r\nlow water in the autumn.\r\n\r\nDuring the winter, due to ice shoves, the water occasionally\r\nrises to an extreme of 28 feet above the low water level. An\r\nartificial embarkment, parallel to the shore, about one and\r\none-third miles long, protects the whole of the upper part of\r\nthe harbour, including the entrance to the Lachine Canal, from\r\nnot only the currents of the river but from ice shoves. This\r\nconstitutes the protected tidal basin in which the water rises\r\nand falls with the river level.\r\n\r\nIt has not been necessary to purchase any land above the high\r\nwater mark on the beach, as all piers and wharves have been made\r\nartificially by building out into the shallow water and the\r\nberths formed by dredging.\r\n\r\nFrom the entrance to the protected basin for about two and\r\none-half miles downstream, to Hochelaga, the river channel is\r\ntoo much contracted to permit of the construction of piers or\r\njetties, and this part of the harbour is developed as riverside\r\nquays, sufficient width for harbour purposes being obtained by\r\nbuilding the quay-walls in deep water and filling in the area\r\nbehind to give a width from 100 to 250 feet. Below Hochelaga,\r\nwhere the river section is larger, piers have been built out into\r\nthe river, inclined so as to give an easy angle of approach from\r\nthe ship channel.\r\n\r\nThe success of the port is due primarily to its early\r\ndevelopment, before any of the water front had been alienated\r\nfrom the crown, and to its geographical, physical and trade\r\nsituation.\r\n\r\nNo rights or franchises stand in the way of further extensions,\r\nand the sentiment of the country is in favour of a continuance\r\nof the policy of retaining the whole harbour area in the public\r\ninterests.\r\n\r\nThe facility of approach both by ocean vessels, inland vessels\r\nand railways to a convenient point of transfer makes Montreal\r\nalmost unique, there being nothing in the way of close connection\r\nfor traffic from all points, and almost in the heart of a large\r\nand growing city.\r\n\r\nMontreal Harbour is also the terminus of the St. Lawrence Canal\r\nSystem, which affords navigation between Montreal and Lake\r\nErie, a distance of 300 miles, for vessels of 14 feet draft\r\nand a carrying capacity of 2,500 tons. From Lake Erie to this\r\nhead of Lake Superior vessels are able to navigate with a draft\r\nof 20 feet and a carrying capacity of 10,000 tons. The inland\r\nnavigation centering in Montreal therefore commences either by\r\nthe all lake route of 1,600 miles and vessels of 14 feet draft,\r\nor by the lake-and-rail routes, using the 10,000 ton boats to\r\nGeorgian Bay ports or Port Colborne, and connecting with Montreal\r\neither by short-haul rail route or the St. Lawrence canals.\r\n\r\nThe following figures give the total trade in the Harbour from\r\n1901 to 1914:\r\n\r\n           Sea-going Vessels     Inland Vessels.\r\n            Arrived in Port.\r\n                     Total                Total\r\n            Number   Tonnage     Number   Tonnage\r\n  1912       736    2,403,924    12,586   4,649,767\r\n  1900       726    1,393,886     8,310   1,659,616\r\n\r\n             Total Trade\r\n  1911      $201,066,256\r\n  1901      $121,292,349\r\n  1914      $251,873,912\r\n\r\nAbout two-thirds of the grain comes to Montreal in steamers\r\ncarrying 2,500 tons on the 14 foot draft. These vessels cannot\r\nafford to wait, but must be unloaded at once if they are to be\r\nattracted to Montreal. The rest of the grain coming from the\r\nGeorgian Bay ports by rail must also be unloaded quickly, as\r\nduring the grain rush there is a constant railway car shortage.\r\nThe storage and rapid handling of grain has thus become, in the\r\nlast few years, a new factor in the problem of harbour economy.\r\nThere are three modern grain elevators at present in the harbour\r\nand none of the older type. Of the modern elevators, one belongs\r\nto the Grand Trunk Railway. It had a capacity of 1,000,000\r\nbushels, but has been enlarged to a capacity of 2,100,000. The\r\nothers belong to the Harbour Commissioners. No. 1 in 1915 will\r\nbe capable of storing 4,000,000 bushels; while No. 2, recently\r\nerected opposite Bonsecours Market, has a capacity of 2,600,000,\r\nand can handle 1,000,000 bushels a day. It is entirely built of\r\nreinforced concrete, and is the largest of this kind in the world.\r\n\r\nIt is easy to see that Montreal Harbour, being the farthest\r\ninland ocean port of the Northern Continent and also the terminus\r\nof the inland Canadian canal and railway routes, is an important\r\nfactor in the grain carrying trade of the Northern part of the\r\nContinent.\r\n\r\nIn 1914 about two million dollars have been expended by the\r\nHarbour Commission in dredging, renovating piers and wharves,\r\nbuilding new sheds and wharves, and other work incidental to the\r\nfive-year program of development undertaken by them at a total\r\ncost of $15,000,000. All this work has been under the direction\r\nof Mr. W.G. Ross, chairman, Mr. Farquhar Robertson, and Colonel\r\nA.E. Labelle, commissioners.\r\n\r\nThe great desire is now to lengthen the shipping season.\r\nProfessor Barnes, of McGill University, has made the study of\r\nice his specialty and he is at present carrying on experiments\r\nfor the Canadian government. He is of the opinion that winter\r\nnavigation is a possibility. At present the government has, on\r\nthe St. Lawrence, two ice-breakers, which extend the time of\r\nnavigation by a few days. The ice difficulty arises where the\r\nriver widens into a lake, as at Lake St. Peter. Ice forms on the\r\nsides of the lake and is blown into the current. When the banks\r\nagain converge, this ice jams, soon forming a solid ice-bridge.\r\nThe ice-shoves which occur in the spring are caused in the same\r\nway. The solution of the problem is to have ice-breakers always\r\nsuitably situated to break these bridges as soon as they form.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               II\r\n\r\n                      HARBOUR COMMISSIONERS\r\n\r\nThe following is a list of the Boards of Harbour Commissioners\r\nthat have executed the duties of the Trust from 1830 up to the\r\npresent time showing the interest represented by each member:--\r\n\r\n* Indicates the President of the Board.\r\n\r\n  (_c_) Indicates the representative of the Corn Exchange.\r\n  (_t_) Indicates the representative of the Montreal Board of Trade.\r\n  (_m_) Indicates the representative of the City of Montreal.\r\n  (_s_) Indicates the representative of the Shipping interest.\r\n  (_c de c_) Indicates the representative of the Chambre de Commerce.\r\n\r\nThe members not indicated as representatives of the Corn\r\nExchange, Board of Trade, City of Montreal, Chambre de Commerce\r\nor Shipping interest have been appointed by the Government of\r\ntheir time.

In 1836 the building now used by\r\nthe Inland Revenue on Place Royale was commenced and opened for\r\nthe customs office in 1845. It is of the Tuscan order and was\r\ndesigned by Mr. Ostell.\r\n\r\nIn 1790 in the fall the merchants of Montreal presented a\r\nmemorial desiring the establishment of a custom house separate\r\nfrom that of Quebec on two grounds: (1) the necessity of having\r\nthe goods landed at Quebec; (2) the want of authority in the\r\nsurveyor of the ports to grant certificates for the exportation\r\nof pot and pearl ashes. This was strenuously objected to by the\r\nnaval officers, on the ground that were the prayer answered the\r\npassage between Quebec and Montreal would be taken advantage of\r\nby the country merchants, shop keepers, publicans, etc., to carry\r\non an illicit trade “to the injury of the revenue and the fur\r\ntraders.” The complaints in the memorial state that the landing\r\nat Quebec of cargoes for Montreal “must be attended with very\r\nheavy expense for agents, wharfage and labourers, besides the\r\nwaste that will happen on cargoes of liquor by landing. What\r\nis of still greater consequence, is the loss of time which may\r\narise, it being well known that the delay of a few hours waiting\r\nfor a clearance upwards has occasioned vessels to be many weeks\r\nin performing a voyage of sixty leagues.” This is, of course,\r\nan allusion to the sailing vessels then solely used. These\r\ninconveniences were removed and the application was not repeated.\r\nA further memorial, dated from Montreal the 21st of October,\r\n1799, represents that certain modifications are all that are\r\nrequired and that “a separate and independent custom house may\r\nintroduce intricacies, difficulties, delays and expense beyond\r\nwhat at present exists and can be foreseen and if so render the\r\nmeans of redress extremely tedious, not to say impracticable.”\r\nThe names attached to the memorial are Isaac Todd, Forsyth,\r\nRichardson & Company, Auldjo, Maitland & Co.; Leith, Jameson &\r\nCompany; John Gray; Samuel David; James and Andrew McGill; David\r\nDavid; McTavish, Frobisher & Company; J. Laing; Parker, Gerard &\r\nOgilvie; Richard Dobie.\r\n\r\nThe introduction of steam vessels made new regulations necessary.\r\nIn 1831 vessels coming to Montreal continued to report at\r\nQuebec. In consequence of remonstrances the superintendent of\r\ncustoms residing at Montreal was authorized by a provisional\r\nact to collect the provincial revenues there, but this was only\r\na partial relief, as the crown duties had still to be settled\r\nfor at Quebec, to the great loss of merchants, shippers and\r\nconsignees. The Committee of Trade of Montreal represented in\r\ntheir memorial of 1831 that the navigation of the St. Lawrence\r\nbetween Quebec and Montreal was rendered speedy and certain by\r\nthe employment of steam towboats, but the necessity of entering\r\nthe vessels at the Quebec custom house caused a delay of one day\r\nand sometimes two days in unloading. The burdens laid upon the\r\nshipping coming to Montreal, the memorial states to have been\r\nexceptional for that city, no other instance being known of a\r\nmerchant being compelled to pay duties on his importations at a\r\ndistance of 180 miles from the port of discharge, the expense\r\nand inconvenience thence arising being equivalent to an extra\r\ntax. The memorial reveals the difference of the two ports today.\r\nIt states that the vessels resorting to Montreal bore a small\r\nproportion to those entering Quebec, but the memorials already\r\nanticipated that by improvements in the river, vessels from\r\nsea would land at Montreal the whole of the goods for its own\r\ndistrict, Upper Canada and the adjoining frontier of the United\r\nStates.\r\n\r\nThe first Custom House building situated at Place Royale was\r\nbegun in 1836 and finished in 1838. Montreal, accordingly\r\nobtained its own completed Custom House in 1838. In 1870 the\r\nGovernment purchased from the Royal Insurance Company the present\r\nCustom House building at 1 Common Street. A newly erected Custom\r\nHouse is now (1914) in course of completion on Youville Square.\r\n\r\nThe Collectors of Customs at the Port of Montreal have been:\r\n\r\nWm. Hall, from 1838 to 1849: Tancrède Bouthillier, from July,\r\n1850, to November, 1863; Benj. Holmes, from December, 1863, to\r\nMay, 1865; John Lewis, acting, from May, 1865, to September,\r\n1866; A.M. Delisle, from September, 1866, to October, 1873; W.B.\r\nSimpson, from November, 1873, to June, 1882; M.P. Ryan, from\r\nJuly, 1882, to January, 1893; W.J. O’Hara, acting, from January,\r\n1893, to December, 1895; R.S. White, from January, 1896.\r\n\r\nMontreal became a port of entry in 1842.\r\n\r\n\r\n                 THE MONTREAL PILOTAGE AUTHORITY\r\n\r\nIn the early part of the eighteenth century an official knowing\r\nthe navigation of the St. Lawrence boarded the king’s ships and\r\nbrought them to Quebec, and in 1731 the first official pilot\r\nwas appointed, and sent each season thereafter to Isle Verte, to\r\nawait ships arrivals. This appears to have been the beginning of\r\nthe St. Lawrence Pilotage.\r\n\r\nAfter the British occupation, and during the term of General\r\nMurray’s governorship, in 1762, an order was issued requiring a\r\nnumber of pilots to be stationed early in each season at Bic, and\r\nto remain until the middle of October, also a further number at\r\nIsle aux Coudres. No person was to act as a pilot, unless he had\r\npassed a satisfactory examination, and had a certificate signed\r\nby the governor.\r\n\r\nIn 1805 there was passed an act entitled “An Act for the better\r\nregulation of pilots and shipping in the Port of Quebec, and\r\nin the harbours of Quebec and Montreal and for improving the\r\nnavigation of the River St. Lawrence, and for establishing a fund\r\nfor decayed pilots, their wives and children.”\r\n\r\nThis was the beginning of the Trinity House of Quebec and its\r\njurisdiction then included the harbour of Montreal. Further acts\r\nwere passed in 1807, 1811, 1812, 1822 and 1834, amending and\r\nextending the provisions of the preceding acts. By an act passed\r\nin 1832, a separate Trinity House was constituted for Montreal.\r\nThis arrangement continued until the passing of the act in 1873,\r\nwhich made the Harbour Commissioners of Montreal the authority.\r\nThey continued to be the authority till the passing of the Act\r\nof 1903, when the Minister of Marine and Fisheries became the\r\nauthority, which he still continues to be.\r\n\r\n\r\n                THE SHIPPING FEDERATION OF CANADA\r\n\r\nMontreal is the headquarters of the Shipping Federation of\r\nCanada. In 1903 in order to amalgamate those interested in\r\nthe shipping business of Canada a charter of incorporation\r\n(3 Edward, VII Chap.), was granted to “Hugh Andrew Allan,\r\nrepresenting the firm of H. & A. Allan; John Russell Binning,\r\nrepresenting Furness, Withy & Company, Limited; James Thom,\r\nrepresenting the Hamburg-American Packet Company; William I.\r\nGear, representing the Robert Reford Company, Limited; Frank A.\r\nRouth, representing the firm of F.A. Routh & Company; David W.\r\nCampbell, representing the Elder-Dempster Company, Limited; James\r\nGordon Brock, representing J.G. Brock & Company; Charles McLean;\r\nMcLean, Kennedy & Company; and John Torrence, representing the\r\nDominion Line of Steamships; and the Leyland Line of Steamships\r\nrespectively, and such others as hereafter become members of the\r\nassociation.”\r\n\r\n\r\n                       IMPORTS AND EXPORTS\r\n\r\nStatistics of Imports and Exports since Montreal was made a Port\r\nof Entry in 1842:\r\n\r\nIn its fiftieth annual report the Montreal Board of Trade in 1892\r\npresented tables of statistics showing as nearly as possible the\r\ndevelopment of trade in Montreal since 1842, when this city was\r\nmade a port of entry.\r\n\r\nThe accompanying figures portraying conditions every ten years,\r\nwere taken from that report and give an excellent summary.\r\n\r\nPrior to 1850 the government did not publish blue book\r\ninformation of trade conditions, and the statistics referring\r\nto trade before that time were obtained from various sources.\r\nWhat early figures were obtained are accurate so far as could\r\nbe determined, but there are unavoidable gaps where information\r\ncould not be secured.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        EXCISE DEPARTMENT\r\n\r\nPrevious to the confederation of the provinces, the excise\r\nduties, the canal tolls and the harbor dues were collected under\r\nthe management of the Customs Department. The revenues from the\r\nother public works were collected either by the Department of\r\nPublic Works or by the Crown Lands Department and the issue of\r\nbill stamps was managed by a Board of Stamps and Excise.\r\n\r\n  By the act constituting the Department of Inland Revenue, it was\r\n  enacted that the Department should have the control and management\r\n\r\n  1. Of the collections of all duties of excise.\r\n\r\n  2. Of the collections of all stamp duties and the preparation and\r\n  issue of stamps and stamped paper, except postage stamps.\r\n\r\n  3. Of Internal taxes.\r\n\r\n  4. Of Standard weights and measures.\r\n\r\n  5. Of the administration of the laws affecting the culling and\r\n  measuring of timber and the collection of slidage and boomage\r\n  dues.\r\n\r\n  6. The collection of bridges and ferry tolls and rents.\r\n\r\n  These conditions have at different dates been changed until now.\r\n\r\n  The Inland Revenue consists of Excise, Weights and Measures, Gas\r\n  and Electric Light, and Food Inspections.\r\n\r\n  Excise is the branch which supervises and collects the duties\r\n  from distilleries, malthouses, breweries, tobacco factories,\r\n  cigar factories, bonding warehouses, compounders, bonded\r\n  factories for the manufacture in bond of vinegar, acetic acid,\r\n  perfumes, pharmaceutical preparations, soaps, fulminates, malt\r\n  cereals, etc.\r\n\r\n  The Inland Revenue is divided into two services: the Inside and\r\n  the Outside.\r\n\r\n  The Inside comprises all officials in the Department at Ottawa.\r\n\r\n  The Outside comprises all the rest of the staff, the officials\r\n  who actually assess and collect the revenues and duties.\r\n\r\n  The Excise, Montreal, is officered by sixty-two men--forty-six of\r\n  whom are permanently appointed, the rest, sixteen, are temporary\r\n  employees.\r\n\r\n  There are licensed, in Montreal: One distillery, four malthouses,\r\n  sixteen breweries, forty-one cigar factories, one acetic acid\r\n  factory, five perfumes, six pharmaceutical preparations, fourteen\r\n  bonded warehouses, twenty-one chemical stills and one wood\r\n  alcohol manufacturer.\r\n\r\n  The Weights and Measures Inspection are responsible for the\r\n  verification of all weights and measures used in trade.\r\n\r\n  Gas Inspection has charge of the inspection of all meters used by\r\n  consumers of gas and the illuminating power and purity of gas.\r\n\r\n  Food Inspection deals with the purity of alimentary substances.\r\n\r\n  As a collecting office, the Inland Revenue, Montreal, is second\r\n  only to the Customs, and collects nearly one-half of all the\r\n  excise revenue of Canada.\r\n\r\n  The officers named by the British Government and who remained\r\n  in office at Confederation were R. Bellemare, Inspector; P.\r\n  Durnford, Collector, assisted by a staff of fourteen officers.\r\n\r\nThe first excise office was situated on St. James Street, on part\r\nof the site now occupied by “La Presse Building”; in 1871, it was\r\nmoved to the present location, at No. 412 St. Paul Street, (the\r\nsite of the first public square in Montreal).\r\n\r\nThe steady increase in collections of the Inland Revenue duties\r\nis one of the best indications of the growth of Montreal.\r\n\r\n\r\n  TABLE OF THE TRADE OF THE PORT OF MONTREAL FROM 1882 TO 1912\r\n\r\n                Sea-going

It is of the\r\ndouble-sided self-docking type, on the principle known as the\r\n“bolted sectional.” It consists of a pontoon or lifting portion\r\nof the dock, and two parallel side walls, built on to and forming\r\npart of the same, and the whole length is divided into three\r\ncomplete and separate sections, which, when bolted together, form\r\nthe complete dock. These sections are so arranged that when the\r\ndock is separated into its three parts, any two of them can dock\r\nthe remaining third between them. For this purpose each section\r\nis fitted with its own independent pumping machinery, so that it\r\ncan also act as an independent unit.\r\n\r\nThe general dimensions of the dock are as follows:--\r\n\r\n                                                  Ft.

At present a gigantic million dollar ice breaker,\r\nthe second in the world, is being built by this firm for the\r\nDominion government to be launched in 1915. In addition a bucket\r\ndredge costing $835,000 has been ordered by the Government for\r\ndelivery in June, 1916.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                           CHAPTER XL\r\n\r\n                     TRANSPORTATION BY RAIL\r\n\r\n\r\n                               IV\r\n\r\n               MONTREAL AND THE RAILWAYS OF CANADA\r\n\r\n  MONTREAL THE CENTRE OF RAILWAY COMMUNICATION--THE FIRST\r\n    RAILWAY--THE SNAKE RAIL AND THE “KITTEN”--“THE CHAMPLAIN AND\r\n    THE ST.

OTHER SYSTEMS--THE “INTERCOLONIAL”--THE CANADIAN NORTHERN AND\r\n    ITS MOUNTAIN TUNNEL.\r\n\r\nNight and day from January 1st to December 31st, year in and year\r\nout, the heavily loaded passenger and freight trains pass into\r\nand out of the railway terminals of Montreal, bearing to their\r\nvarious destinations millions of human beings and thousands of\r\ntons of freight.\r\n\r\nAltogether eight important railways have entrance to Montreal at\r\nthe time of writing, while yet another transcontinental line, the\r\nCanadian Northern, is planning a new and imposing terminal in\r\nconnection with the tunnelling of Mount Royal, which is the most\r\nimportant engineering undertaking in Montreal projected since\r\nthe construction of the Victoria tubular bridge. At the present\r\ntime the Canadian Pacific, the Grand Trunk, the Intercolonial,\r\nthe Canadian Northern, the New York Central, the Rutland, the\r\nDelaware & Hudson, and the Central Vermont railroads are all\r\nrunning trains directly into Montreal. The railway freight yards\r\nare crowded with cars bearing the initials of practically every\r\nroad of any importance on the continent.\r\n\r\nThis huge business in carrying, of such vital importance to the\r\ncity of Montreal, yet so little appreciated, because of our\r\nfamiliarity with it, is less than a century old, for the success\r\nof the locomotive was not admitted until the opening of the\r\nLiverpool & Manchester Railway in 1830. On the news of this\r\nthe first railway in Canada, the Champlain & St. Lawrence, was\r\nchartered in 1831 to run from La Prairie to St. Johns, P.Q., and\r\nopened for traffic with horses in 1836 and first worked by the\r\nlocomotives in 1837. Its length was only sixteen miles.\r\n\r\nThe rails were of wood with flat bars of iron spiked on them, and\r\nfrom the tendency of this class of rail to curl or bend upwards\r\nas the wheels passed over it, it became known as the snake rail.\r\nThe first locomotive used on the line was sent from Europe,\r\naccompanied by an engineer, who for some unexplained reason had\r\nit caged up and secreted from the public eye.\r\n\r\nThe trial trip was made by moonlight in the presence of a\r\nfew interested parties and it is not described as a success.\r\nSeveral attempts were made to get the “Kitten,” for such was\r\nthe nick-name applied to this pioneer locomotive, to run to St.\r\nJohns, but in vain: the engine proved refractory and horses were\r\nsubstituted for it.\r\n\r\nIt is related that a practical engineer being called in from\r\n“the States,” the engine which was thought to be hopelessly\r\nunmanageable, was pronounced in good order, requiring only plenty\r\nof wood and water. This opinion proved correct, for after a\r\nlittle practice the extraordinary rate of speed of twenty miles\r\nper hour was obtained. It was a “strap” rail until 1847 when the\r\nheavy T-iron was laid.\r\n\r\nThe Champlain & St. Lawrence Railway, thus inaugurated the\r\nrailway era of Canada in the year 1832, and the line continued\r\nto be operated as a separate and distinct organization for\r\njust forty years. In 1872 it was made a part of the Grand\r\nTrunk Railway, and it is operated as a part of the Grand Trunk\r\norganization at the present time.\r\n\r\nThe Atlantic & St. Lawrence Railroad followed the Champlain\r\n& St. Lawrence. Although not a Canadian railroad, this line\r\nhad a tremendous influence on the development of the country,\r\nsince it gave the Canadian people access for the first time to\r\nan all-the-year-round port. Halifax and St. John were yet mere\r\nvillages without any rail communication with the industrial\r\nheart of the country, separated from it by that vast stretch\r\nof then undeveloped and almost unexplored country which we now\r\nrecognize as lower Quebec and upper New Brunswick. The Atlantic\r\n& St. Lawrence line gave access to the port of Portland, running\r\nfrom that city through a thriving agricultural country to Norton\r\nMills, Vermont, just on the Canadian border. Norton Mills and\r\nLa Prairie, now merely villages without any special importance,\r\nwere at this period in Canada’s growth railway terminals of\r\nconsequence.\r\n\r\nThe Atlantic & St. Lawrence road was built with a purpose. It\r\nwas chartered in 1845, and long before it was completed, in\r\n1852, to be exact, the Grand Trunk Railway of Canada was granted\r\na charter by the Provinces of Upper and Lower Canada, which,\r\nwith subsequent additions, provided for the construction of the\r\npresent Grand Trunk line between Riviere du Loup, Quebec, and\r\nSarnia, Ontario.\r\n\r\nThe Atlantic & St. Lawrence Railroad was completed about 1860,\r\nand was at once leased for a period of 999 years to the Grand\r\nTrunk Railway. This gave the Canadian people unbroken stretches\r\nof railroad from Portland, Maine, and from Riviere du Loup to\r\nMontreal, and on this foundation the present huge transportation\r\nbusiness of this city has been erected. The people of Canada\r\nrecognized the importance of this development by grants of cash\r\nand mail subsidies to the line.\r\n\r\nIn point of age, therefore, the Grand Trunk Railway claims\r\npriority over all the Canadian railways now existing, and the\r\nroad may be said to be the pioneer railway of Canada.\r\n\r\n\r\n                     THE GRAND TRUNK RAILWAY\r\n\r\nThe first meeting of the Grand Trunk Railway Company of Canada\r\nwas held in the City of Quebec on Monday, July 11, 1853. The Hon.\r\nJohn Ross was appointed president of the road; Benjamin Holmes\r\nwas made vice president, while Sir C.P. Roney became managing\r\ndirector and secretary-treasurer.\r\n\r\nThe following is a list of the presidents and general managers of\r\nthe road, with their dates of service:\r\n\r\n      Presidents.

Seargeant                              1891-1896\r\n  Chas. M. Hays                               1896-1901\r\n  Geo. B. Reeve                               1901-\r\n  Chas. M. Hays (Vice Pres. and Gen. Mgr.)    1902-1912\r\n\r\n  (Since January 1, 1910, Mr. Alfred W. Smithers has been Chairman\r\n  of the Board of Directors in London, England--a new departure in\r\n  the organization.)\r\n\r\nIn order to gain insight into the conditions under which the\r\nrailway was operating, Sir Henry Tyler, who later became\r\npresident of the road, paid an official visit to the Dominion in\r\n1867 under instructions from the Board of Directors. Sir Henry’s\r\nreport gives some interesting information about the road as it\r\nthen existed.\r\n\r\nHe found that the Grand Trunk at that time comprised a total length\r\nof 1,377 miles. In addition to the water routes hereinbefore\r\nmentioned, the chief competitor in Canada of the company was the\r\nGreat Western Railway Company, extending from Niagara Falls to\r\nSarnia, Ontario, and to Detroit, Michigan. As a result of this\r\ncompetition Sir Henry reported (1867) that the rates for freight\r\nservice averaged 0.92 of a cent per ton per mile--flour being\r\ncarried between Montreal and Toronto as low as a cent per ton per\r\nmile. The average rate on the Grand Trunk System for the year 1910\r\nwas 0.69 of a cent per ton per mile.\r\n\r\nThe average number of freight cars to a train was then reported\r\nas 15.5; the average net load of each train as 150 tons.\r\n\r\nThe records for 1910 show an average of 26.6 freight cars per\r\ntrain and the average weight of “revenue” freight carried, per\r\ntrain, was 299 net tons.\r\n\r\nThe original gauge of the Grand Trunk was five feet six inches,\r\nexcept that portion between Port Huron and Detroit, where the\r\n“narrow gauge” of four feet eight and one-half inches was used.\r\nSir Henry’s report recommended the adoption of the wider gauge\r\nfor the whole of the road, bringing it into conformity with the\r\nother lines on the continent.\r\n\r\nThe year of Sir Henry’s visit was also the year of Confederation,\r\nand this change, which had so tremendous an effect upon Canada’s\r\nhistory, had also an important bearing upon the history of the\r\nGrand Trunk Railway. The new Dominion Government, being desirous\r\nof opening up the country purchased on the 17th of July, 1879,\r\nthat portion of the Grand Trunk road which lies between Riviere\r\ndu Loup and Point Levis, with the object of making it a portion\r\nof the new Government road, which subsequently became the\r\nIntercolonial Railway.\r\n\r\nWith the proceeds of this sale the Grand Trunk agreed to\r\nconstruct a line between Port Huron, Michigan, and Chicago. The\r\nInternational Bridge Company undertook another great engineering\r\nfeat in 1857, in the building of the Niagara River Bridge,\r\nbetween Fort Erie and Buffalo. This bridge was completed in 1873,\r\nand entirely rebuilt to accommodate the heavier traffic in 1900.\r\nThe two systems of railways, the Grand Trunk and Great Western,\r\nwere amalgamated into the present system under agreement dated\r\nAugust 12, 1882.\r\n\r\nThe directors started out in 1889 to make the Grand Trunk the\r\nlongest double tracked system on this continent, and the line is\r\nnow double tracked from St. Rosalie, a point thirty-eight miles\r\neast of Montreal and St. Johns, twenty-seven miles south, to\r\nChicago, an unbroken double tracked run of 907 miles. With other\r\ndouble tracked lines connecting principal cities the Grand Trunk\r\nis now in possession of 1,037 miles of duplicate tracks.\r\n\r\nThe Grand Trunk owns and controls ten grain elevators in various\r\nparts of the Dominion and the United States, having a total\r\ncapacity of 20,000,000 bushels of grain. The latest of these, an\r\nelevator with a capacity of 5,500,000 bushels, is located at Fort\r\nWilliam, and was built in connection with the Grand Trunk Pacific\r\nRailway.\r\n\r\nThe four principal bridges owned by the Company, the Victoria\r\nBridge, the Coteau Landing Bridge, the steel arch bridge across\r\nNiagara Gorge, and the International Bridge across the Niagara\r\nRiver, have a total length of 16,653 feet, and the railway owns\r\nother bridges in different parts of the continent, which have a\r\ntotal of 18.43 miles.\r\n\r\nRecent improvements and developments of the line in the city and\r\ndistrict of Montreal include the erection of the magnificent new\r\noffices on McGill Street and the promotion, in connection with\r\nthe Jacques Cartier Union Railway, of a belt line around the\r\ncity. Also, in 1892, the company secured control of the Canadian\r\nExpress Company, which now operates over all the Grand Trunk and\r\nconnecting lines from Montreal.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: INITIALS OF SIR GEORGE SIMPSON AND HIS INDIAN\r\nGUIDE FOUND NEAR BANFF IN 1913 The date, 1841, indicates that the\r\ninitials were evidently carved at the time Sir George was making\r\nthe original survey of the Canadian Pacific Railroad through the\r\nmountains.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIRST TRAIN IN CANADA Laprairie, P.Q.--St. Johns,\r\nP.Q. 1836]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GRAND TRUNK LOCOMOTIVE BUILT IN G.T.R.

One of these is located at Southwalk,\r\nabout two miles east of the passenger station at St. Lambert,\r\nand the other is at Turcot, in Notre Dame de Grace Ward of the\r\nCity of Montreal. At St. Lambert there is an aggregate of about\r\ntwenty-seven miles of new sidings, and at Turcot, twenty-two\r\nmiles of new tracks have been laid down.\r\n\r\nIt is an interesting feature of these yards that no shunting or\r\nswitching movements is done on the main lines.\r\n\r\nSo far this chapter has dealt exclusively with the Grand Trunk\r\nRailway System proper, and no mention has been made of that\r\nmomentous period of the railway history of the Dominion in\r\nwhich we now live and which followed the agreement entered into\r\nbetween the Grand Trunk Railway and the Dominion Government.\r\nThis agreement provided for the construction of a railroad clear\r\nacross Canada, from Moncton, New Brunswick to Prince Rupert,\r\nBritish Columbia, wholly within Canadian territory. The project\r\nwas conceived by the late President Chas. M. Hays, of Montreal,\r\nwho was one of the victims of the Steamship Titanic disaster.\r\n\r\nThe new line, known as the Grand Trunk Pacific Railway, is now\r\npractically complete and is already operating over the major\r\nportion of its road, there being a fine passenger and freight\r\nservice between Ft. William, Ontario, and Prince Rupert, British\r\nColumbia. Its construction marks the most important development\r\nof the Grand Trunk, since the amalgamation with the Great Western\r\nRailway of Canada, and it is expected to make the Pioneer Railway\r\nof Canada one of the greatest forces in the development of the\r\ncountry, the uniting of East with West into one huge harmonious\r\nwhole.\r\n\r\nThe Grand Trunk Pacific Railway was incorporated October 24,\r\n1903, following the contract entered into between the G.T.R. and\r\nthe Dominion Government, on July 29th of the same year, providing\r\nfor the construction of the line as a joint government and Grand\r\nTrunk enterprise.\r\n\r\nRoughly the terms under which this huge work is being carried out\r\nare as follows: The railway is divided into two sections, Eastern\r\nand Western. The Western Division, extending from Winnipeg to\r\nPrince Rupert, is subdivided into the Prairie and Mountain\r\nsections, and the entire line has been constructed by the Grand\r\nTrunk Pacific Railway Company.\r\n\r\nThe Eastern Division, 1,804 miles in length, is being\r\nconstructed by the Canadian Government, under supervision of the\r\nCommissioners of the Transcontinental Railway. It links Moncton\r\nwith Winnipeg, and thus gives the company a clear coast to coast\r\nline. Upon the completion of the work, the Government leases the\r\nEastern Section to the Grand Trunk Pacific Railway for a period\r\nof fifty years, on the following terms:\r\n\r\nFor the first seven years of the said term, the Company\r\nshall operate the same subject only to payment of “Working\r\nExpenditures;” for the next succeeding forty-three years the\r\ncompany shall pay annually to the government, by way of rental, a\r\nsum equal to 3 per cent per annum upon the cost of construction\r\nof the said division, provided that if, in any one or more of\r\nthe first three years of the said period of forty-three years\r\nthe net earnings of the said division, over and above “Working\r\nExpenditure” shall not amount to 3 per cent of the cost of\r\nconstruction, the difference between the net earnings and\r\nthe rental shall not be payable by the company, but shall be\r\ncapitalized and form part of the cost of construction, upon the\r\nwhole amount of which cost a rental is required to be paid at the\r\nrate aforesaid after the first ten years of the said lease, and\r\nduring the remainder of the said term.\r\n\r\nAll the branch lines of the Eastern Division will be constructed\r\nby and at the cost of the company.\r\n\r\nThe company is responsible for the construction of all lines\r\nwest of Winnipeg, the Government guaranteeing the principal and\r\ninterest of three-quarters of the cost of the main line from\r\nWinnipeg to the Pacific Coast terminus at Prince Rupert, B.C.,\r\nfor fifty years, but with the limitation that such three-quarters\r\nof the cost shall not exceed thirteen thousand dollars per mile\r\non the Prairie Section--with no limitation, however, in regard to\r\nthe cost of the Mountain Section. The Grand Trunk Railway Company\r\nof Canada has guaranteed the principal and interest for fifty\r\nyears of the balance required to complete the main line of the\r\nWestern Division.\r\n\r\nThe line has created a new seaport on the Pacific, which will\r\ngive a further impetus to our already immense trade with Japan\r\nand the other commercial countries of the Orient, as well as\r\nopening a fresh route to Australasia which cannot but help bind\r\nin closer union the British Dominions of Australia and New\r\nZealand, already closely related to us by the splendid sentiment\r\nof Empire. It opens up splendid new wheat fields in the Prairie\r\nProvinces of Manitoba, Saskatchewan and Alberta, and taps also\r\nimmensely valuable coal and agricultural areas in British\r\nColumbia. Through its branches it reaches the already created\r\nindustrial and commercial centres of the great West, while its\r\nfleet of steamships links Prince Rupert with the other Pacific\r\nCoast ports, both on the Canadian and the United States shores.\r\nWith the example of the growth of the Western United States since\r\nadequate rail facilities were provided for their cities and towns\r\nbefore us, it is difficult indeed to see how the Grand Trunk\r\nPacific Railway can fail to establish itself as a dominant factor\r\nin the growth of Western Canada, a growth which at this view it\r\nis impossible to estimate and which only time can show.\r\n\r\nBefore passing from the history of the Grand Trunk Railway, a\r\nplace must be given to the record of the great engineering feat\r\nin transportation effected by them. Previous to the building of\r\nthe first tubular Victoria bridge erected by this company over\r\nthe St. Lawrence at Montreal, the only communication with the\r\nGrand Trunk lines hitherto, was by ferry to Longueuil, then the\r\nterminus. Passengers and freight were carried on barges across\r\nthe St. Lawrence. In winter sleighs were used across the ice. In\r\na period of one to three weeks in the spring this crossing was\r\neither abandoned or very dangerous in the break up of the ice.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      THE VICTORIA BRIDGES\r\n\r\nAs early as 1847 the Hon. John Young had desired to erect a\r\nbridge. In 1851 he used the opinion and report of Mr. Thomas C.\r\nKeefer, a Canadian, on the practicability of building a bridge\r\nover the St. Lawrence in the position eventually chosen and based\r\non the findings of his report.[1]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GRAND TRUNK STATION]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GRAND TRUNK OFFICES]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLACE VIGER STATION]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PROPOSED MONTREAL TERMINAL OF CANADIAN NORTHERN]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WINDSOR STREET STATION]\r\n\r\nIn 1852 Mr. A.M. Ross, C.E., the engineer of the Victoria Bridge,\r\ncame to Canada on behalf of English capitalists. He was met at\r\nQuebec by Sir John Young who took him to Montreal to inspect the\r\nlocality for a bridge. Mr. Ross suggested an iron tubular bridge,\r\ntook soundings and plans of the bridge as designed by him and\r\nreturned in the fall.\r\n\r\nMr. Robert Stephenson, the consulting engineer, and a son of\r\nGeorge Stephenson, the great railway pioneer, came to Montreal in\r\n1853 and at a complimentary dinner, he said:\r\n\r\n“I cannot sit down without referring to the all-important subject\r\nof a bridge over your magnificent river. Abundance of information\r\nwas brought over to me in England by my esteemed friend, Ross,\r\nduring the last visit he paid to that country so that I was able\r\nto get a good notion of what the bridge was to be before I came\r\nout here.\r\n\r\n“I had been here twenty-five years before and the St. Lawrence\r\nseemed to be like the sea, and I certainly never thought of\r\nbridging it.” On the same occasion he said: “I assure you I\r\nappreciate your kindness most amply and one of the proudest days\r\nof my life will be that when I am called upon to confer with\r\nthe engineers of the Grand Trunk Railway on bridging the St.\r\nLawrence.”\r\n\r\nThe stone for the first pier of the Victoria Bridge was laid on\r\nJuly 22, 1854, by Sir. C.P. Roney, the first secretary of the\r\nGrand Trunk, along with Vice President Benjamin Holmes, Mr. James\r\nHodge, the builder, Mr. A.M. Ross, C.E., the engineer, and other\r\ngentlemen who were also joined by Lady Roney, Mrs. Hodge and Mrs.\r\nMaitland, each taking the trowel and assisting in preparing the\r\nmortar board for the first stone in the first pier in the great\r\nconstruction. Of the enormous difficulties in building it and the\r\ndanger by accidents, a dozen at least having been killed, we say\r\nnothing beyond that the contractors had to contend with a rapid\r\nstream two miles broad and with enormous shoves of ice.\r\n\r\nOne of those employed on the construction says: “There were\r\nhundreds of men employed--many of them being Indians. The latter\r\nmanned the rafts that brought the timber down from Nun’s Island,\r\nalthough, of course, it came from the west, at the first go-off.\r\nWe got our timber from the west and our stone from Pointe Claire.\r\n\r\n“The first year’s work was entirely swept away. We had made good\r\nprogress with the under work and the crib work.\r\n\r\n“Hundreds of men had worked all spring, summer and fall. The\r\nwork was well advanced and the contractors were congratulating\r\nthemselves that they would be able to fulfill their contract\r\non time; but the ice came down in the winter with a rush and\r\ncarried everything before it--crib work, material, coffer\r\ndams--everything that had been done or set up. The loss was\r\ngreat, but the loss of time was the most important.\r\n\r\n“That necessitated another year in the duration of the contract.\r\nThe latter called for completion in five years. It was now seen\r\nthat six would be required. But nobody could be blamed, and the\r\ncontractors set to work with a will, and did the work over again.”\r\n\r\nThe first crossing was made on November 24, 1859, when the first\r\nto cross were Vice President Holmes, Hon. George Etienne Cartier,\r\nJames Hodges, A. M. Ross, Walter Shanly, Messrs. Gzowski,\r\nMacpherson, Forsyth, Captain Rhodes and others. The last stone\r\nwas laid and the last rivet driven on August 25, 1860, by the\r\nyoung Prince of Wales, afterward King Edward VII. On the occasion\r\na grand banquet was held near the bridge, at which addresses were\r\ngiven by the Prince, the Duke of Newcastle, Mr. A.M. Ross, Mr.\r\nHodges and others. To commemorate the event Mr. Blackwell had a\r\nmedal prepared by the chief engineer of Her Majesty’s seals, a\r\ngold one of which was presented to the Prince and a bronze one to\r\neach of the officers of the Grand Trunk Railway.\r\n\r\nIt bears a fine impression in relief of the Prince as he then\r\nwas, and the words, “Welcome Albert Edward, Prince of Wales.\r\nVisited Canada and inaugurated the Victoria Bridge, 1860.”\r\n\r\nThe first train with passengers traversed the bridge December 17,\r\n1859.\r\n\r\nThis structure was 9,184 feet long, of twenty-three spans of 242\r\nfeet and one in the center of 330 feet.\r\n\r\nSir George Etienne Cartier, before being knighted, was asked by\r\nQueen Victoria at Windsor, “Mr. Cartier, I hear that the Bridge\r\nat Montreal is a very fine structure. How many feet is it from\r\nshore to shore?”\r\n\r\nThe reply was pleasing to Her Majesty. “When we Canadians build\r\na bridge and dedicate it to Your Majesty we measure it, not in\r\nfeet, but in miles!”\r\n\r\nThe difficulties connected with the building of the bridge\r\nwere greater than they would be today. The facilities and the\r\nmachinery necessary were comparatively crude and inadequate. The\r\nbridge itself was in the nature of an experiment; nor was it\r\ndesigned in the original plan, for a tubular bridge. The plans\r\nwere altered several times during the progress of the work. It\r\nneeded the genius of George Stephenson, which had to be invoked,\r\nto make the plan realizable.\r\n\r\nBut when the bridge was completed, it was almost instantly seen\r\nwhat a boon it was to the whole country. Trade began to pick up.\r\nPopulation increased. The Grand Trunk was extended. Towns began\r\nto grow, and this great enterprise, brought to a successful\r\nconclusion, encouraged other enterprises to follow.\r\n\r\nIt may be said that the building of the bridge brought out the\r\nfirst of the British immigrants. Here and there, there might\r\nhave been a few, but the bridge opened up such possibilities\r\nof expansion as encouraged people to come out, and especially\r\nskilled men, who began to settle in the neighborhood of Point St.\r\nCharles, forming the nucleus of that population which, today,\r\npreserves the sturdy characteristics of the men who founded what\r\nwas then a distinct colony. The building of the bridge meant\r\nthe extension of the Grand Trunk shops, the giving of increased\r\nemployment, and the setting up of a big town on the other side of\r\nthe canal.\r\n\r\nBefore many years the growth of traffic called for the\r\nreplacement of this dark tubular bridge by the present openwork\r\nsteel bridge, with double tracks, carriage ways and foot walks\r\nwhich now stand on the piers which held the old bridge. The Royal\r\nVictoria Jubilee Bridge was opened for traffic on December 13,\r\n1908.\r\n\r\nThe chief engineer of this bridge was Mr. Joseph Hobson, now\r\nconsulting engineer of the Grand Trunk Railway System. The\r\ncontractors were the Detroit Bridge and Iron Company for the\r\nwhole of the superstructure and for the construction of\r\nnineteen spans of it, including the center one. The remaining six\r\nspans were constructed by the Dominion Bridge Company of Montreal.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: VICTORIA JUBILEE BRIDGE, MONTREAL Opened for\r\ntraffic December 13th, 1898]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CANADIAN PACIFIC RAILROAD BRIDGE AT LACHINE]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: VICTORIA TUBULAR BRIDGE, MONTREAL Opened for\r\ntraffic by H.R.H. the Prince of Wales, August 25th, 1860]\r\n\r\nThe masonry required for the enlargement of the abutments and\r\npiers was built by Mr. William Gibson.\r\n\r\nThe work was commenced in October, 1897, by the erection of the\r\nspan on the west end, the structure being built completely around\r\nthe tube of the old bridge, the latter being cleverly utilized as\r\na roadway. Traffic never ceased except for twenty hours during\r\nthe whole construction, the longest delay being two hours. The\r\nold bridge weighed 9,044 tons, the new 20,000 tons. The width of\r\nthe old bridge was sixteen feet, the new one sixty-six feet eight\r\ninches. The height of the former superstructure was eighteen\r\nfeet, that of the new superstructure over all is from forty to\r\nsixty feet. The new bridge ranks among the foremost constructions\r\nof present engineering progress.\r\n\r\nOn October 16, 1901, the son of Edward VII, the Duke of York, and\r\nCornwall, now George V, visited the bridge with the Duchess, now\r\nhis Queen.\r\n\r\nThough the Grand Trunk Railway is the pioneer railroad of\r\nCanada, it was greatly assisted by English capitalists, although\r\nMontrealers played a prominent part.\r\n\r\n\r\n                  THE CANADIAN PACIFIC RAILWAY\r\n\r\nThe history and development of the Canadian Pacific Railway\r\nshows, however, a still closer connection with Montreal. The\r\ngreat line was born in this city, reared through an infancy of\r\ntremendous difficulties here, and has always, and probably will\r\nalways, have its headquarters in this city. Though four of the\r\noriginal syndicate, J.S. Kennedy, of New York; J.J. Hill, of St.\r\nPaul; Morton Rose and Company, of New York, and Kohn Reinach,\r\nof Paris, were not citizens, yet the four others were good\r\nMontrealers, Lord Strathcona, then plain Donald A. Smith, Lord\r\nMount Stephen, then George Stephen, Duncan McIntyre, and R.B.\r\nAngus, who, as faithful guardians, risked their very financial\r\nexistence that it should become a strong, self-supporting\r\ninstitution, able to stand on its own legs. That their belief in\r\nthe future of this splendidly virile institution was justified,\r\neveryone now realizes, but it is nevertheless a fact that the\r\ngeneral opinion of some of the wisest of Canada’s wise men at\r\nthe time of its commencement was that the C.P.R. would never be\r\nfinished, or if it should crawl through its first few years of\r\nexistence, it would never earn sufficient net profits to pay its\r\nbills for axle grease.\r\n\r\nBorn in the midst of political turmoil, pulled through a puling\r\nand precarious infancy only by tremendous personal sacrifice\r\non the part of those responsible for its existence, this\r\norganization is now one of the leading corporations of the entire\r\nworld, its ramifications reaching clear around the globe and its\r\nannual income counted in figures which stagger the mind of the\r\naverage man.\r\n\r\nThe C.P.R. owes its tremendous success to the imagination of its\r\nsponsors, and to nothing else. When it was brought into being,\r\nthe developed portion of Canada was well served by the Grand\r\nTrunk Railway and its connecting lines. There was no room for\r\nanother railway among the established markets of what is now\r\ncalled Eastern Canada. But the men who created the C.P.R. out\r\nof their hopes and their belief in the future of the country,\r\nlooked beyond the East. Between Ontario and the Pacific Coast,\r\naccording to popular superstition at that time there lay nothing\r\nbut trackless, ice bound wastes, of no value to man or beast,\r\nand cut off from the balmy climate of British Columbia by the\r\nimpenetrable fastnesses of the Rocky Mountains. The original\r\nsyndicate and their executive led by William Van Horne, the great\r\nconstructive railroad genius of the nineteenth century, thought\r\ndifferently. For one thing they had already had experience of the\r\npossibilities of the Western United States, because of certain\r\nrailroad transactions conducted by them in that territory, and\r\nthey believed that the possibilities of Western Canada were every\r\nbit as great. Neither ridicule nor abuse could shake them from\r\ntheir determination, and they literally rammed their convictions\r\ndown the throat of an only half willing Dominion Government, to\r\nwhat end we all know.\r\n\r\nThe project of a line connecting the railway system of\r\nCanada with the seaboard of British Columbia was one of the\r\nchief inducements held out to that province to enter into\r\nConfederation. At several periods between Confederation and the\r\nyear 1880 the Dominion Government had before it very strong\r\nschemes for the construction of a transcontinental line, but none\r\nof them proved effective until what was known as the Canadian\r\nPacific Syndicate finally entered into a definite contract in\r\n1880 for the construction of the road. The financial arrangements\r\nwere largely in the hands of the Montrealers already mentioned,\r\nGeorge Stephen, Donald A. Smith, R.B. Angus, and Duncan McIntyre.\r\n\r\nAs the Macdonald Government allied itself with the C.P.R.\r\nproposals, the railroad was for some time classed by the public\r\nas a Tory organization, but for the last twenty years the C.P.R.\r\nhas held itself aloof from all party politics. In the early days,\r\nhowever, it was not surprising that opponents were vehement in\r\nopposition. They condemned the scheme unsparingly, declaring\r\nthat it would never pay expenses. Their predictions of ruin and\r\ndisaster and the pessimistic attitude of influential parties\r\nin England, no doubt, led the Canadian Government to grant a\r\nlarger aid to the enterprise in order to increase the chances\r\nof ultimate success. The company was incorporated in 1881. Its\r\nendowment consisted of 25,000,000 acres of land in western\r\nCanada and $25,000,000 in cash. It was also presented with some\r\n700 miles of railway, which the Government had constructed at a\r\ncost of $35,000,000. The railway mileage taken over represented\r\nless than one-fourth of the amount necessary to connect Montreal\r\nand Vancouver. The cash subsidy of $25,000,000 represented\r\nconsiderably more than a cash subsidy of that amount would\r\nrepresent today, for thirty years ago a dollar in cash had a much\r\nlarger purchasing power. With reference to the land grant, it can\r\nsafely be said that, when the company was formed in 1881, few\r\nrealized its value.\r\n\r\nThe names of two men must be connected with the successful\r\nfortunes of the company, William Van Horne, who was elected\r\ngeneral manager, and Thomas Shaughnessy, appointed purchasing\r\nagent. Their humble offices were first in the Imperial Building,\r\non St. James Street, opposite Place d’Armes Square. The general\r\noffices were next removed to Victoria Square, to the old Albert\r\nBuilding. Things did not progress in the early stages, but fine\r\noptimism marked these men.\r\n\r\nAt one of the early annual meetings there was great\r\nconsternation. The small stockholders were alarmed and Mr. Donald\r\nMcMaster spoke out indignantly for them. Then up rose Sir Donald\r\nSmith and said:\r\n\r\n“Gentlemen: I would be a richer man today if I had never touched\r\nor seen the C P.R.; but I am not going to go back on it now. On\r\nthe contrary, my faith, which has never wavered, is stronger than\r\never. I fully and unwaveringly believe in the C.P.R. I believe\r\nin its future. I believe that in a very short time, it will be\r\nthe greatest earner in the Dominion of Canada. Mark my words.\r\nRetain your holdings. Do not give way to depression. The moment\r\nis unpropitious, owing to the general depression; but the clouds\r\nwill lift; and you will be thankful, in the course of a year or\r\nso, that you held on to your stock.”\r\n\r\nThe bad times passed, the corporation turned the corner, the\r\nearnings increased. Lord Mount Stephen retired, Sir William Van\r\nHorne became president, Sir Thomas Shaughnessy became first\r\nassistant, then general manager, and finally president. David\r\nMcNicoll moved up from assistant passenger agent to general\r\npassenger agent until he became manager and vice president.\r\n\r\nOne remarkable feature of the history of the C.P.R. is that no\r\none of the men who financed the road in the beginning, has made\r\nanything like a big fortune out of it, in spite of the tremendous\r\nsuccess which has crowned the undertaking. Lord Mount Stephen\r\nsold the three or four thousand shares he held in the company\r\nwhen he retired in 1885, at fifty-three. Lord Strathcona, of\r\ncourse, retained his connection with the line, and drew his\r\ndividends on the five thousand shares he held, but he did not\r\nmake what might be even considered a reasonable return for the\r\nstaking of his financial existence, and the same thing applies to\r\nother men who have directed the affairs of the company from time\r\nto time.\r\n\r\nAt the time of the incorporation of the road in 1881 the capital\r\nwas $5,000,000. Today it is $200,000,000 and every cent of it\r\nneeded to provide for the development of the corporation. In 1882\r\ntwo stock issues totalling $60,000,000 worth of stock were made,\r\nto complete the road. Three years later, on November 7, 1885,\r\nLord Strathcona drove the last spike and the road was officially\r\nopened, and its splendid history began.\r\n\r\nIn 1886 the gross earnings of the road were $8,368,493. In 1911\r\nthe gross earnings were $104,167,808, crossing the hundred\r\nmillion mark for the first time in the road’s history. This\r\ngrowth has continued in corresponding ratio, though partially\r\neffected by the international war of 1914.\r\n\r\nIn 1886 the mileage controlled by the C.P. R, was 4,315 miles.\r\nIts rolling stock in its principal divisions in 1886, was\r\ntotalled as follows:\r\n\r\nLocomotives, 336; freight cars, 7,835; no steamships.\r\n\r\nIn 1914, the line owned rolling stock as follows:\r\n\r\nLocomotives, 2,248; freight cars, 88,000; first and second class\r\npassenger cars, baggage cars and colonist sleeping cars, 2,174;\r\nsleepers, dining and cafe cars, 502; conductors’ vans, 1,427;\r\nwork cars, shovels, etc., 5,850.\r\n\r\nThe total mileage owned and controlled by the line, up to June\r\n30, 1914, was 18,050 miles, and the passenger cars could move\r\nsimultaneously 165,000 people.\r\n\r\nIn the course of its development, the C.P.R. has been extremely\r\nfortunate in being able to secure for its directorate men of\r\nbroad vision. Thus it is that this railroad which is more than\r\na railroad, and this corporation which is in operation an\r\nEmpire Builder of the truest type, has found occasion in the\r\ncourse of its existence to put its energy to work in directions\r\nwhich the average railroad never dreams of. The scope of a\r\ngreat transcontinental railroad is wide enough in ordinary\r\ncircumstances, but the policy of the C.P.R. has been to extend\r\nits activities in every direction where it appeared that the\r\ninterests of the Dominion, which are indissolubly united with\r\nthe interests of the road, might be advanced. In pursuance of\r\nthis plan we get its immigration and land development policy,\r\nwhich is unique on the Continent.\r\n\r\nOne of the first notable efforts of the road in this direction\r\nwas its aid to the cattle ranching industry in Alberta. By means\r\nof low rates and the special facilities offered by the line\r\nto cattle ranchers the great beef industry which founded the\r\nprosperity of Alberta was nurtured and developed until it grew to\r\nbe a feature of Canada in the minds of uninitiated Old Country\r\npeople, and to the regular impression of snow and Indians which\r\nprevailed in the average Englishman’s mind in the ’80s, was added\r\nthe romantic idea of cowboys. After cattle, came wheat and here\r\nagain the railroad aided the farmers in all possible directions,\r\nrealizing that in the prosperity of the inhabitants of the\r\nterritory which it served, lay its own future greatness.\r\n\r\nIn a thousand and one ways the great railroad has advanced\r\nthe various interests of the West. Its splendid immigration\r\norganization has seconded the efforts of the Dominion Bureau in\r\nLondon. Each year at harvest time it transports tens of thousands\r\nof labourers from Eastern Canada to the West to help harvest its\r\ncrops, and as an instance of the lengths to which the road is\r\nprepared to go in order to advance the interests of the great\r\ncommunity from which it draws the greater part of its wealth,\r\nthere may be taken the case of the Winnipeg water scheme.\r\n\r\nSome years ago the City of Winnipeg desired to install an\r\nexpensive plant to improve its water supply. The undertaking was\r\na huge one, planned to meet the needs of the rapidly growing\r\ncity for many years to come and the cost was heavy. The C.P.R.\r\ndonated $200,000 to help defray the expenses, and Winnipeg was\r\nduly provided with a water supply which cannot be bettered on the\r\nContinent.\r\n\r\nThe Company’s various interests, outside of its straight railroad\r\nwork, would make by themselves a huge undertaking for any\r\nordinary commercial organization. It owns coal, copper, lead, and\r\ngold mines, big smelting plants in British Columbia and enough\r\ntimber limits to make any lumber company in the Dominion envious.\r\nThe hotel section of the Company’s operations, originally planned\r\nto provide accommodation for passengers where such accommodation\r\ndid not exist, have extended until they are a material factor in\r\nthe Company’s wealth.\r\n\r\nThe Company’s tremendous land holdings in the West are regarded\r\nby many financial experts as its most powerful asset. When these\r\ngrants were made, or at least such of them as were made to the\r\nCompany in return for its services in opening up what was then\r\nregarded as a barren and trackless waste, it is not likely that\r\nanyone, not even excepting the directors themselves, realized\r\nthe value of the grants. Since the original grants were made\r\nother valuable and extensive land areas have been acquired\r\nthrough the purchase of other railways which owned land grants.\r\nAltogether the Company now owns over seven million acres of land\r\nin Manitoba, Alberta and Saskatchewan and nearly four and a half\r\nmillion acres in British Columbia. These lands have steadily\r\nincreased in value as the railroad itself developed the country.\r\nIn 1905 the sales were 509,386 acres at an average of $4.80 per\r\nacre. In 1909 the sales of these same lands were 306,083 acres\r\nat an average of $10.96. In 1910 the inrush of settlers from the\r\nUnited States and Great Britain served to increase the demand for\r\nthe C.P.R. lands and 829,609 acres of the unimproved lands sold\r\nat $12.78 per acre along with 145,421 acres of irrigated lands\r\nat $26.59 per acre. And in 1911, the sales of unimproved land\r\nwere 631,777 acres at the average of $14.11; and of irrigated\r\nlands 19,097 acres were sold at the very satisfactory average\r\nof $33.63 per acre. This progressive rise in value is most\r\nimpressive. Every year without exception shows an increase,\r\nand in some years the increase is considerable. It is to be\r\nremembered, too, that when the company sells a parcel of land\r\nto a good farmer-settler it is just beginning its profitable\r\nrelations with him. For he will in all probability be a heavy\r\nshipper of grain outward over its lines in future years, and he\r\nwill occasion the shipment of much merchandise inward as well.\r\n\r\nThe latest and perhaps the greatest work which the C.P.R.\r\nhas undertaken in connection with its land holdings, is its\r\nirrigation scheme, which has transformed nearly one and a half\r\nmillion acres of barren land into fertile farm country, at an\r\noutlay of over $15,000,000. The rounding out of the irrigation\r\nscheme involves the bringing of the best class of farmers from\r\nthe United Kingdom or the United States and planting them in\r\nthe Canadian West, on farms which are “ready made” for them.\r\nDemonstration farms are provided to show the best methods of\r\nworking the land, and everything possible is done to ensure the\r\nsuccess of the newcomers’ enterprise. In this manner and by the\r\nsale of similar farms to residents of the United States desirous\r\nof settling in Canada, the C.P.R. in its latest undertaking\r\nis perhaps doing more than ever before to provide Canada with\r\nher most pressing need, sturdy self-reliant citizens, and so\r\nfurthering the cause of Imperial unity which has been the\r\nguiding spirit of this splendid enterprise ever since those four\r\nMontrealers dreamed their dream of a new Empire plucked from the\r\nbarren expanse of the Last Great West.\r\n\r\nOf the C.P.R. steamship line we speak in its proper place. For\r\nthe C.P.R. railroad and its attendant enterprises on land, there\r\nappears to be an almost limitless future. A rough estimate of\r\nthe value of its railroad, shipping and hotel systems would not\r\nbe far wrong if placed at $885,000,000. What the C.P.R. will\r\nbe doing this time ten years from now, who shall say? With the\r\ninspiration of so glorious a past behind them, who can set a\r\nlimit on the possibilities which will open up for the new rulers\r\nof the road’s destinies? The All Red Line so greatly discussed\r\nsome years ago as a government project already exists in the\r\nC.P.R. It is possible to board a C.P.R. train at Windsor Street\r\nand to circle the globe, never leaving the sphere of influence\r\nof this tremendous organization. A splendid result surely to\r\nbe attained by the little quartette of dreamers whose idea of\r\na railroad line of Atlantic to Pacific met with so scornful a\r\nreception when it was first mooted a bare forty years ago.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    THE INTERCOLONIAL RAILWAY\r\n\r\nThe Intercolonial Railway, which runs from Montreal to Halifax,\r\nand the two Sydneys, claims the distinction of being a successful\r\ngovernment-owned railroad.\r\n\r\nIt was originally the North American and European Railroad,\r\nwhich was taken over by the government over half a century ago.\r\nThere were at that time only about fifty miles of railway. This\r\nhas been added to from time to time, until the road is now a\r\nvery considerable one in size and importance. It travels through\r\nsome of the finest scenery in Canada, and does a heavy tourist\r\nbusiness, the sporting country it touches being famous the world\r\nover. It is connected with all the big Atlantic seaports, and has\r\ngrain elevators at St. John, N.B.\r\n\r\nThe actual trackage owned by the Intercolonial extends westward\r\nonly as far as St. Rosalie Junction. From there to Montreal the\r\ntrains have running rights over the Grand Trunk tracks.\r\n\r\nThe Intercolonial is of importance to Montreal in supplying the\r\nmeans of communication to Halifax during the season of closed\r\nnavigation.\r\n\r\n\r\n                  THE CANADIAN NORTHERN RAILWAY\r\n\r\nThe Canadian Northern first reached Montreal under the name of\r\nthe Great Northern Railway of Canada. Its history of the few\r\nyears preceding is full of interest. Its success has been due to\r\nthe financial and business ability of two Canadians, Sir William\r\nMackenzie and Sir Donald Mann.\r\n\r\nWhat is now the Canadian Northern Railway had its inception in\r\nDecember, 1906, when the Lake Manitoba Railway and Canal Company\r\nbuilt one hundred miles of track between Gladstone and Dauphin,\r\nManitoba, and ran trains over it. The line was a success from its\r\ninception, and next year Mackenzie and Mann, famous partners,\r\nbuilt under the name of the Manitoba and South Eastern Railway, a\r\nline out of Winnipeg running in the direction of Lake Superior.\r\nThe purchase of the Port Arthur, Duluth & Western line completed\r\nthe entrance into Port Arthur. The lines of the Northern Pacific\r\nRailway in Manitoba were taken over by the Manitoba Government\r\nand leased to the Canadian Northern for a period of 999 years,\r\nwhich gave them terminal facilities in Winnipeg and connections\r\nto the International Boundary. In 1901, the company which\r\nstarted with one hundred miles of track and a payroll of $650 a\r\nmonth found itself owning and operating 1,200 miles of line and\r\ncarrying 12,000,000 bushels of grain to the head of navigation at\r\nPort Arthur. Extensions to Edmonton and through the valley of the\r\nSaskatchewan were planned and the whole huge enterprise bloomed\r\nforth one fine morning as the Canadian Northern Railway.\r\n\r\nThe rapid expansion of this comparatively insignificant railway\r\ninto a force to be reckoned with when discussing the growth of\r\nWestern Canada in the short space of five years made even the\r\noptimistic Westerners sit up and take notice, but the activities\r\nof the two Scotch Ontarians did not stop here. By 1905 the new\r\nline had reached Edmonton, having built four bridges across\r\nthe Saskatchewan River to get there, while in the same year\r\nPrince Albert was reached by way of the Swan River and Carrot\r\nRiver valleys. On the way across, the C.N.R. made a city out\r\nof Edmonton. When the line was first projected the town had\r\nsomething like 3,000 people. Today it has 45,000 and is still\r\ngrowing.\r\n\r\nSaskatoon, Regina and Calgary quickly linked into the chain\r\nuntil the Canadian Northern line west of the Great Lakes had a\r\ntotal mileage of 5,000 miles. Construction joining Vancouver\r\nwith Edmonton is now being pushed rapidly to completion through\r\nthe Yellowhead Pass, and the Thompson and Fraser River valleys\r\nand will be open for traffic in 1915. Construction is also going\r\non in Ontario which will link Montreal and Ottawa together in\r\na direct line with Port Arthur and the West, the line between\r\nToronto and Ottawa having been opened in January, 1914, making a\r\ntotal mileage of 7,800 for the system at the end of 1914.\r\n\r\nThe history of the Canadian Northern’s activities in Montreal,\r\nstill fresh in the minds of our readers, gives a fair index of\r\nthe spirit in which this line is conducted and managed. The\r\nC.N.R. desired an entrance to Montreal for its main line. It\r\nwas vital that the terminal should be central. Accordingly, the\r\nproperty on Lagauchetiere Street was purchased and a freight\r\nterminal at the Haymarket.\r\n\r\nSo when it was pointed out that Mount Royal stood serene between\r\nthe C.N. R. line and the C.N.R. terminal, the answer came back:\r\n“Run a tunnel through it.” And accordingly, the Montreal Tunnel\r\nis now being bored.\r\n\r\nTypical also of the whole enterprise is the creation of the new\r\nmodel city of Mount Royal. Obviously a lot of open farm land at\r\nthe northern entrance to the tunnel promised no profit for the\r\nC.N.R. So they bought the land and sold it again in building\r\nlots, and just as soon as the first electrical locomotive\r\npulls the first C.N.R. passenger train through the Mount Royal\r\ntunnel there will be a new suburb--residences, and shops, and\r\npostoffice--all complete ready to feed business into this train\r\nand into the thousands which will follow. Of the Canadian\r\nNorthern steamships mention is made elsewhere.\r\n\r\nThe other railways mentioned as coming into Montreal, do so\r\non running rights with one or other of the above mentioned\r\nrailroads.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[1] Mr. Keefer’s name has not been sufficiently connected with\r\nthose of Ross and Stephenson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                           CHAPTER XLI\r\n\r\n                     TRANSPORTATION BY ROAD\r\n\r\n\r\n                                I\r\n\r\n        THE ANCIENT AND MODERN POSTAL SERVICE OF MONTREAL\r\n\r\n  ANCIENT ROADS--THE “GRAND VOYER”--GOOD ROADS MOVEMENT--THE\r\n    EVOLUTION OF ROADS--“POST” MASTERS RECOGNIZED IN\r\n    1780--THE EARLY POSTAL SYSTEM OF MONTREAL AND BENJAMIN\r\n    FRANKLIN--BURLINGTON THE TERMINUS--EARLY LETTER RATES--MAIL\r\n    ADVERTISEMENTS--THE QUEBEC TO MONTREAL POSTAL SERVICE--EARLY\r\n    POSTOFFICE IN MONTREAL--OCEAN AND RAILWAY MAIL SERVICE--THE\r\n    PRESENT POSTOFFICE--ITS HISTORICAL TABLETS BY FLAXMAN--THE\r\n    DEVELOPMENT OF THE POSTAL SYSTEM--THE POSTMASTERS OF MONTREAL.\r\n\r\nThe question of the transportation of the mails and the origin of\r\nthe Montreal postal services makes some prefatory remarks on the\r\nroad system necessary. The early roads were under the Grand Voyer\r\nof the province, a sort of surveyor general who had deputies\r\n“sous voyers” and surveyors under him. The roads were divided\r\ninto three classes: (1) _Chemins Royaux_--post roads or “front”\r\nroads, the soil of which belonged to the crown; these generally\r\ntraversed the “front” of the seignories. (2) _Chemins de Ceinture\r\net de Traverse_--or back roads, the soil of which belonged to\r\nthe seigneurs. These ran in the rear and parallel with the royal\r\nroads. (3) _Chemins de Sortie et de Communications_--called also\r\n“_routes_” and by-roads. These were crown roads connecting those\r\nin front and rear, also banal roads which were those leading to\r\nthe seigneury mill.\r\n\r\nThe office of Grand Voyer was held as early as 1669 by Sieur de\r\nBécanour. It had almost despotic power. This continued until\r\n1832, when his powers were transferred to the road commissioners.\r\nIn 1841 the roads came under the municipality. The condition of\r\nthe early roads to Montreal and in Canada were deplorable, and\r\nCarleton was compelled to enforce the “individual responsibility”\r\nof proprietors and tenants to keep the post roads in repair.\r\nThese roads were thirty feet wide and the cross roads maintained\r\nby joint labor were twenty feet wide. It was not until Sydenham’s\r\ntime that much improvement was effected, owing to the passive\r\nresistance of the French-Canadian to enforced labour. By 1850\r\ngood roads ran over the Province in all directions. Not all of\r\nthem were well made, but most of them were useable for stage\r\ntraffic which had greatly increased.\r\n\r\nThe evolution of the Canadian roads (1) the bridle road, (2) the\r\nwinter road, (3) the corduroy road, (4) the common or graded\r\nroads, (5) the turnpike, macadam, gravel and plank is as follows:\r\n\r\nThe bridle roads were made solely for the use of horsemen, before\r\ncarriages had been introduced into the more unsettled parts of\r\nthe country. By their aid the people found their way to religious\r\nceremonies and transported their grain on pack horses to the\r\nneighbouring villages. They were made simply by clearing away\r\nthe branches and trunks of trees so as to allow a horse to pass\r\nthrough the bush.\r\n\r\nThe winter roads were very important. The Canadian winter\r\nwith its snow and frost was a blessing to the farmer, giving\r\nhim a firm, smooth road over which heavy loads could be drawn\r\nwith ease. Most of the heavy freight was not moved until the\r\nwinter unless the water routes were accessible. It was in the\r\ncold weather that the lumbermen and builders transported their\r\nsupplies and the farmer carried his crops to market.\r\n\r\nThe “corduroy” roads were made by placing tree trunks side by\r\nside and consequently could be constructed only where there was\r\nan abundance of timber. As these trees decayed with time and\r\nmoisture the roads required constant repair and a great amount\r\nof valuable timber was wasted. It was not an uncommon thing for\r\none of these roads to be destroyed in a single season by frost.\r\nIn many places they actually delayed progress, as they were\r\nused as an excuse for delaying the construction of more durable\r\nhighways. At their best they were rough, very slow and damaging\r\nto vehicles, “any attempt at speed being checked by immediate\r\nsymptoms of approaching dissolution in the vehicle.” The effect\r\non the driver and his passengers appears to have been equally\r\ndisastrous, the “poor human frame being jolted to pieces.”\r\n\r\nThe common or graded roads were marked out by fences in the more\r\nsettled and open districts, and in the woods by wide clearings.\r\nThey were properly drained and bridged and an attempt was made to\r\nreduce steep hills. Although they did not possess an artificial\r\nroad-bed, they were very serviceable except for the heaviest\r\ntraffic. Their construction was expensive, however, as they were\r\nlaid out in straight and direct lines with the idea of overcoming\r\nrather than going around obstacles in their path.\r\n\r\nIn the more settled parts of Canada the construction of the\r\nturnpike with its artificial road-bed began with the opening of\r\nthe nineteenth century. The materials composing the road-bed\r\nvaried. Gravel was used where convenient. In many districts\r\nplank roads were used after the Union, but unless they rested\r\non a bed of sand were a failure owing to the expense of the\r\nfrequent necessary renewals. The most satisfactory road-bed was\r\nof macadam, although in many places Canadian traffic was not\r\nheavy enough thoroughly to consolidate the materials used in its\r\nconstruction. The best roads of this kind were those outside\r\nof Montreal and Quebec. In Upper Canada the turnpikes were\r\ncontrolled by joint stock companies in the main and were kept in\r\na miserable condition.\r\n\r\nBefore the War of 1812 the four principal roads in the provinces\r\nfollowed the routes taken later by the railways. The first,\r\nconnecting Lower Canada with the Maritime Provinces, began at\r\nPoint Levis, running thence to Temiscouata, whence it ran to\r\nFredericton which it connected with St. John, terminating at\r\nHalifax, after traversing a total distance of 718 miles.\r\n\r\nThe second road followed the route taken later by the Grand Trunk\r\nand Great Western Railways, running from Quebec via Montreal,\r\nCoteau-du-lac and Cornwall, to Kingston and thence to York. From\r\nYork it ran to Michillimackinac by way of Fort Erie and Detroit,\r\na total distance of 1,107 miles.\r\n\r\nThe purpose of the third road, which ran from Montreal to the\r\ninternational boundary line en route to Boston, was later\r\naccomplished by the St. Lawrence and Atlantic Railway. The\r\nother road twenty-eight miles long connected La Prairie wtih\r\nIsle-aux-Noix.\r\n\r\nOn these roads the conveyances were the calèche and the post\r\nchaise. The charge was high, varying from six and one-half cents\r\nupward per mile. The first stages in Upper Canada, running\r\nbetween Queenstown and Fort Erie, charged four cents per mile.\r\nThe original rate from Kingston to York by stage was $18.00\r\nmore than the present return first class fare from Montreal to\r\nToronto. The fare between York and Niagara was $5.00. On the\r\nroads near Montreal and Quebec moderate rates were charged and a\r\nconsiderable traffic maintained. In the Upper Province however\r\nthe roads were controlled by Companies who not only charged\r\nexcessive tolls but kept the roads in poor condition.\r\n\r\n_Maitres de Poste_, or postmasters, were first recognized by law\r\nin 1780 and some half a dozen ordinances and acts were passed in\r\ntheir favour or to control them between that date and 1819, when\r\ntheir privilege ceased. The distance between Montreal commonly\r\ncalled sixty leagues was divided into twenty-four stages. The\r\n“Maitres de Poste” were obliged to keep four _calèches_ and four\r\n_carioles_. They had the exclusive right of passenger traffic by\r\nland, charging twenty to twenty-five cents per league--twelve to\r\nfifteen dollars the journey between Quebec and Montreal. Benjamin\r\nFranklin when deputy postmaster general of North America in\r\n1766 stated before a committee of the house of commons that the\r\nonly post road then in Canada was between Montreal and Quebec.\r\nThe origin of the postal system of Montreal dates from 1763 and\r\nis due to the enterprise of Benjamin Franklin, who was then\r\nholding an important position in the postal department of the\r\nAmerican colonies. Franklin, on hearing that the treaty of Paris\r\nhad definitely made Canada a sister colony, without waiting for\r\nofficial sanction hurried thither although a man of fifty-seven\r\nyears of age, not fearing the hardships of the wild journey. In\r\nhis diary he records that in the spring of 1763 he set out on a\r\ntour of inspection of the northern districts under his control\r\nand did not stop until he visited Quebec and Montreal where he\r\nopened postoffices and arranged for a weekly courier between\r\nthese towns and New York. His prompt action was afterwards\r\nappreciated by the postmaster general of England.\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to locate the position of the “village”\r\npostoffice established by Franklin. The postal communication thus\r\ncommenced between Canada and the American colonies continued\r\nexcept for a break during the war of 1775 till the colonies had\r\nobtained their independence. In November, 1783, a few months\r\nafter the treaty of peace, mails were restored between England\r\nand Canada through the medium of the new postal office at\r\nBurlington. This latter now became the terminus of the Canadian\r\ncourier service. In 1792 the first postal convention between\r\nCanada and the United States benefited Montreal, although it was\r\nstipulated that the transmission of letters should be by United\r\nStates fast mail packets and land service by Burlington.\r\n\r\nLetters were carried by the packets at four cents from Great\r\nBritain to New York, then twenty cents added for the journey\r\nto Burlington, with the further charge of twenty cents on to\r\nQuebec and twenty cents more was demanded for the further journey\r\nthrough Canada. A letter would then have cost Montrealers about\r\nforty-four cents and that only if it consisted of a single sheet\r\nof paper and weighed less than an ounce. Above that, the price\r\nwas quadrupled. A letter that today cost two cents[1] from\r\nLiverpool then cost about a dollar and sixty-four cents. But if\r\nthe British postal service had been used a letter under one ounce\r\nwould have cost ninety-two cents and above the ounce $3.64.\r\n\r\nAn advertisement was put in the Montreal papers in 1797 on the\r\n18th of June. “A mail for the upper countries, comprehending\r\nNiagara and Detroit will be closed at the office on May 30th\r\nat 4 o’clock in the evening to be forwarded from Montreal by\r\nthe annual winter express on Thursday, 3d February next.” In\r\n1809 an advertisement of this year states, “A passenger may go\r\nfrom Boston to Montreal, a distance of 312 miles, in four days\r\nand a half. This line is furnished with the new and convenient\r\nstages, good horses and careful drivers.” But the irregularity\r\nand slowness of the service in Canada itself called forth loud\r\nprotests from many merchants who were forced to employ private\r\nrunners to carry their mail. In 1811 Mr. George Heriot, then\r\nPost-Master General, investigated these complaints and his report\r\nis descriptive of local conditions:--“The mail is carried from\r\nNew Brunswick and vice versa by two couriers, one setting out\r\nfrom Quebec and the other from Fredericton once a month in winter\r\nand once a fortnight in summer. The distance is 361 miles; the\r\ncost of conveying the mails £240. There is one courier once a\r\nweek between Fredericton and St. John, N.B., eighty-two miles at\r\na cost of £91.5s. There are two packets weekly across the Bay of\r\nFundy between St. John and Digby, 36½ miles at £350. There is one\r\ncourier twice a week between Digby and Annapolis, twenty miles,\r\nand one courier between Annapolis and Halifax once a week, 133½\r\nmiles. From the commencement of the present year a communication\r\nby post has been opened from Montreal to Kingston. The courier\r\ngoes once a fortnight and has a salary of £100. A post to York\r\nis proposed for six months or during the close of navigation.\r\nThe post between Quebec and Montreal is despatched twice a week\r\nfrom each of those towns. Eight pence is charged for postage on\r\na single letter from Quebec to Montreal. There are on the road\r\nbetween Quebec and Montreal about twenty-seven persons whose\r\nhouses are seven or eight miles distant from each other and who\r\nkeep four or five horses each, not of the best description, and\r\nsmall vehicles with two wheels of a homely and rude construction\r\nhung upon bands of leather or thongs of unmanufactured bull’s\r\nhide by way of springs. They will with much difficulty contain\r\ntwo persons in front of which a man or boy is placed to guide the\r\nhorse. The rate at which they go when the roads are favourable\r\nis not much more than six miles an hour. The roads are generally\r\nin a very bad state as no proper measures are taken for their\r\nrepair.”\r\n\r\nThe mail system of that time was a part of the English postal\r\nservice and the province had no voice in the matter. About\r\n1815-1816 according to Borthwick, “The Montreal postoffice was\r\na room about twelve feet square in St. Sulpice Street near St.\r\nPaul. There were no letter boxes; it was all ‘general delivery’\r\nin its crudest form. The few letters laid scattered on a table\r\nand had all to be looked at at each application at the door. Very\r\nfew letters came or went. The mail to Upper Canada was weekly\r\nand the seven days’ collection could be contained in one small\r\nmailbag. That to Quebec was oftener and larger. The English mail\r\ncarried in sailing vessels arrived during the summer at periods\r\nof from a month and a half to three months apart. In winter it\r\ncame by New York and was longer on the way. Postage was very\r\ndear, about 9d. to Quebec and 5d. to St. Johns, 1s. 6d. to\r\nwestern parts of Canada and 1s. 6d. to lower provinces.\r\n\r\n“In 1820 there appeared in the various newspapers an official\r\nadvertisement signed by a member of the English postal service\r\ngiving a list of reduced rates between Canada and many foreign\r\ncountries. The postage on a letter to the various countries\r\nof western Europe varying from 3s. 10d. to 4s. 4d. There were\r\nno money letters for indeed there was no money in the form\r\nconvenient for sending thus. A recipient of a letter paid all\r\nthe postage except in cases when it crossed the United States\r\nboundary, when the sender paid as far as the line. There was much\r\nprivate mail carrying, both for pay and free. Anyone traveling\r\nto the United States or Upper Canada was expected to fill half\r\nhis baggage with letters and various articles to persons there.”\r\nAbout 1840 the postoffice at Montreal was at the southwest corner\r\nof St. James street and St. Lambert’s Hill.\r\n\r\nMontreal and Quebec geographically being some hundreds of miles\r\nnearer European ports than New York and Boston, Canadians began\r\non the success of the steam navigation to desire to handle their\r\nown mails directly, and on the foundation of the Allan Line\r\nin 1856 this was put to practice by fortnightly trips until\r\n1859. In 1859 the Allan Line contracted for a weekly mail to\r\nand from Montreal and Quebec in the summer and Portland, Maine,\r\nin the winter. Thus began the ocean mail service to us, now so\r\nlargely developed. The opening of the railway era also assisted\r\nthe postal facilities. The next location of the postoffice at\r\nMontreal was the building constructed in Place d’Armes on the\r\nsite of the present Banque Provinciale. It was followed by a new\r\nlocation on the southwest corner of St. Francois Xavier and St.\r\nJames streets, to be followed in 1876 by the present imposing\r\nedifice on the corner of St. Francois Xavier and St. James\r\nstreets, with the equally large annex erected later and situated\r\non Craig and St. Francois Xavier streets. The Montreal postoffice\r\nis of proportionate size and efficiency to that of any of the\r\ngreat cities of the world.\r\n\r\nThe site of the present postoffice is historic and the following\r\ntablet has been recently placed to explain the four artistic bas\r\nreliefs on the exterior which commemorate it.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          JOHN FLAXMAN\r\n\r\n  Author of these bas reliefs and GREATEST OF BRITISH SCULPTORS was\r\n  born at York, England, July 6th, 1755. Designed the classical\r\n  groups on wedgewood-ware. Made a great reputation in Italy.\r\n  Was the first professor of sculpture at the Royal Academy.\r\n  Executed the monuments of Burns, Kemble, Mansfield and Paoli\r\n  in Westminster Abbey, Sir Joshua Reynolds in St. Paul’s, and\r\n  illustrations of ancient Greek poets. He was elected a Royal\r\n  Academician in 1800, and died December the 7th, 1826.\r\n\r\n  These bas reliefs were part of the facade of the building erected\r\n  on this site for the Bank of Montreal in 1821; later on occupied\r\n  by La Banque du Peuple from 1846 until 1873 and also of that now\r\n  occupied by the General Post Office since 1876.\r\n\r\n  The subjects of the bas reliefs are:--\r\n\r\n  AGRICULTURE,                   MANUFACTURERS,\r\n  ARTS,                          COMMERCE.\r\n\r\nThe Montreal postoffice has had under its control for many years\r\nsubsidiary district postoffices as the growth of population\r\ndemanded them. In 1900 there were only twenty sub-offices. Today\r\nthere are ninety-four stations. Its growth can be seen from a few\r\nfacts.\r\n\r\nCity Mail: In 1900 there were only 180 letter boxes and ten for\r\nnewspapers. In 1910 they amounted to 350 and 142 respectively. In\r\n1914 there are 562 letter boxes and 235 news boxes.\r\n\r\nEnglish and foreign mail: In 1900 the English mailbags received\r\nvia New York were from thirty-three to forty-three. In 1910\r\nthe number was increased from seventy-five to one hundred. The\r\nCanadian steamers bring in at present from 200 to 235 bags. The\r\nCompagnie Generale Trans-Atlantique, which brought in ten to\r\nfifteen bags now brings forty to sixty. The German line adds\r\nseventy to eighty, and there are in addition thirty from other\r\nsources.\r\n\r\nThe directors or postmasters of Montreal have been:\r\n\r\n  1. 1763-1810      Edward William Gray. He combined the offices of\r\n                      sheriff and postmaster.\r\n  2. 1810-1816      F.W. Ermatinger, merchant of Montreal.\r\n  3. 1816-1827      James Williams.\r\n  4. 1827-1840      Andrew Porteous, dismissed by Lord Sydenham for\r\n                      delaying his Excellency’s courier.\r\n  5. 1841-1855      James Porteous.\r\n  6. 1855-1861      Jean Baptiste Meilleur.\r\n  7. 1861-1874      G.S. Freer.\r\n  8. 1874-1891      G. Lamothe.\r\n  9. 1891-1899      Arthur Dansereau.\r\n  10. 1899-1904     Cleophas Beausoleil.\r\n  11. 1904-1911     Henry S. Harwood, ex-M.P. for Vaudreuil.\r\n  12. 1911-         Hon. L.O. Taillon, Ex-Premier Province of\r\n                      Quebec, and for a time postmaster general of\r\n                      Canada.

In\r\n1861, Montreal had a population of but 91,000 and with its\r\nsuburbs 101,439. It was practically the ancient Montreal,\r\nwhich had scarcely outgrown the days when it was a fortified\r\ncity crowded within walls to resist the incursions of hostile\r\nIroquois. The city was bounded on the north by the old creek at\r\nCraig Street, and did not extend west of Victoria Square.\r\n\r\nToday Montreal with its suburbs has a population of approximately\r\n600,000, while the streets which marked its limits fifty years\r\nago are the centre of the downtown business district. Thus within\r\na scant half century the population of Montreal has much more\r\nthan multiplied five times over, its street mileage has increased\r\nin even greater proportion, while practically the whole city has\r\nbeen remodeled and modernized.\r\n\r\nThey were men of courage and far-sighted ideas who in 1861\r\ndecided that the time had come when Montreal needed a street\r\nrailway. The population was small, business was a mere fraction\r\nof that transacted today, and as forbidding as could be found in\r\nany city in the world.\r\n\r\nBut these difficulties did not discourage the founders of the\r\nMontreal Street Railway, who had ample belief in the future\r\ndevelopment of the city, and its consequent opportunities for\r\nstreet railway work. They builded more wisely than they knew\r\nhowever, and could William Molson, John Ostell, William Dow,\r\nJohnston Thompson and William Macdonald, the original directors\r\nof the company, return to Montreal, attend a meeting of directors\r\nat the board room in the Company’s handsome building on Craig\r\nStreet, and then make a tour of the city in one of their\r\nmagnificent modern electric cars, they would probably be lost\r\nin wonder and admiration. The company they founded used horses.\r\nStables were its power stations, and in winter the service was\r\nkept up by sleighs, and in the late fall and early spring by\r\nomnibuses. They started with six miles of track, eight cars,\r\na few horses and one stable. To-day they would return to an\r\nelectric system with hundreds of miles of track extending all\r\nover the city and suburbs, huge power stations, an army of\r\nuniformed, well paid and cared for employes, and many hundreds of\r\ncars which are not merely modern, but so far in advance of the\r\ntimes that the greatest cities of the United States and the world\r\nare paying tribute by the adoption of the same style of cars for\r\ntheir service.[2]\r\n\r\nThe Montreal Street Railway was born with little ceremony, or\r\nanything else to mark the beginning of a new epoch for Montreal\r\nwhen, on May 18th, 1861, the Provincial Legislature adopted a law\r\nincorporating the Montreal City Passenger Railway Company “for\r\nthe purpose of constructing and operating street railways in the\r\nCity and Parish of Montreal.” The provisional directors named\r\nin the act of incorporation were William Molson, John Ostell,\r\nWilliam Dow, Johnston Thompson, William Macdonald, John Carter,\r\nHon. Thos. Ryan and William E. Phillips. All these have long\r\nsince passed away, although they lived to see the riper fruition\r\nof the works they planned.\r\n\r\nOn August 9th of the same year a meeting of the subscribers\r\nwas held at the “Mechanics’ Hall,” at which the following were\r\npresent:--\r\n\r\nWilliam Molson, Thomas Molson, Hon. Judge Gale, Hon. L.H. Molson,\r\nWilliam Macdonald, E.M. Hopkins, William McLaren, Charles Garth,\r\nJ.H. Springle, G. Weaver, William Dow and John Ostell. At this\r\nmeeting J.H. Springle was appointed the first secretary of the\r\nCompany.\r\n\r\nOn August 17th, another meeting was held, at which Alex. Easton\r\nwas awarded the contract for building the first section of road,\r\ncomprising six miles of single track, and an equipment of eight\r\npassenger cars, a stable and car shed. This may be called the\r\nfirst attempt at modernizing Montreal.\r\n\r\nWork was started in September, ground being broken on the 18th,\r\nfor the line from St. Mary Street, near the Quebec toll gate, and\r\nconsiderable progress made. The arrangement was that Mr. Easton\r\nshould build the line and operate it for a time under lease. By\r\nNovember 27th, 1861, part of the line was sufficiently advanced\r\nto be opened. The road met with immediate success, and was well\r\npatronized, although the service, naturally, was slow and the\r\ncars infrequent.\r\n\r\nMatters having progressed thus far a meeting of the directors\r\nwas held on November 5th, 1861, when the Company’s stock books\r\nwere ordered closed, 2,500 shares having been subscribed for at\r\n$50 a share, representing a capital of $125,000. Another meeting\r\nwas held on the next day, when the following were appointed\r\ndirectors: Thomas Morland, E.M. Hopkins, G.W. Weaver, E.S. Freer\r\nand John Ostell. Thomas Morland was elected president.\r\n\r\nIn the following year construction work was continued, and by\r\nJune 10th, 1862, a line had been completed from Place D’Armes on\r\nNotre Dame Street westward, connecting with St. Joseph Street.\r\nThis was equipped with three horse cars.\r\n\r\nOn this same day the Company declared its first dividend, at the\r\nencouraging rate of 12% per annum for the first year.\r\n\r\nOn July 4th, 1862, the Company terminated the lease with the\r\ncontractor, and took over the actual operation of the road, with\r\nconsiderable profit, the earnings far exceeding the lease price.\r\n\r\nAt this time the head office of the Company was in a small\r\nbuilding at the corner of Craig and Place d’Armes, owned by Rev.\r\nMr. Toupin, but in 1863 the Company moved to Hochelaga. But\r\nshortly afterwards the head office of the Company was again at\r\nPlace d’Armes Hill and Craig Street and remained there until 1894\r\nwhen the present Street Railway Chambers were erected. Thus it\r\nmay be said that the head office of the Company has been situated\r\nat the corner of Place d’Armes Hill and Craig Street since the\r\nincorporation of the Company. The terminus of the line was then\r\nHochelaga and the Company spent $300 on an omnibus to connect the\r\ncars with the convent. The service in the city was, of course,\r\nonly a day one, and the cars were pretty far apart. But even then\r\nthe demands of the service on Craig and St. Antoine streets was\r\nsuch that improvements to the tracks were needed so as to permit\r\nof a more frequent service on these streets.\r\n\r\nThe advantage of the car line was so much appreciated by the\r\npublic that in this year, 1863, the Company applied to the city\r\nfor power to build lines on the following streets:--\r\n\r\nCommencing at Papineau Avenue, along St. Catherine to Mountain\r\nStreet with a line in St. Lawrence Street to the Toll Gate\r\nto connect with that now constructed on Craig Street, also\r\ncommencing at St. Joseph Street along McGill Street to Wellington,\r\nto the Bridge and possibly to Point St. Charles.\r\n\r\nDuring 1863 the Company carried 1,066,845 passengers, scarcely 1\r\nper cent of the number carried to-day. It was regarded, however,\r\nas an excellent showing, and the Company started to build six\r\nmiles more track, along Wellington, St. Catherine and St.\r\nLawrence streets. The contract for this work was let to Messrs.\r\nPlunkett and Brady.\r\n\r\nBy May 1864 the St. Catherine line was finished, and opened,\r\nwhile eleven additional cars had to be placed on the Notre Dame\r\nStreet route. Even the track difficulties were felt, and the line\r\non McGill Street had to be renewed.\r\n\r\nBy the end of 1864 St. Catherine, St. Lawrence and Wellington\r\nstreet lines, comprising 5¾ miles, had been opened, and all\r\nproved revenue producers except the last. During that year\r\n1,485,725 passengers had been carried, an increase of about a\r\nhalf a million for the year. In view of the progress made it was\r\ndecided to issue more stock at par to the old shareholders. At\r\nthis time the capital stock of the Company was $200,000.\r\n\r\nThe winter service was being kept up by sleighs, the tracks and\r\nappliances preventing the cars from running. The Company had\r\neight sleighs at this time, with five more being built. There\r\nwere no heating appliances, and in order to keep the passengers\r\nwarm each sleigh was provided with about a foot of pea straw, in\r\nwhich the people buried their cold feet.\r\n\r\nDuring the early days the cars were run in a rather\r\nhappy-go-lucky fashion. Time was of little object. The cars would\r\nstop anywhere to take up passengers, and if one wanted to get\r\noff and talk to a friend or do a little shopping, the obliging\r\nconductors would wait and give their horses a rest. But the\r\ndemands of business were getting too much for this, and in June,\r\n1865, the board decided that in future the cars should not be\r\nstopped to allow passengers to go into stores and make purchases\r\nand return again, because this kept other passengers waiting.\r\n\r\nIt was found that the wages paid were too high, and in August,\r\n1865, conductors were reduced from $30 to $25 a month. The\r\nconductors petitioned for a return to their old pay of $1 a\r\nday, but this was refused, and the Directors reduced the pay of\r\ndrivers from $25 to $20 a month. At this time Mr. J.H.R. Molson\r\nfound he had not time to attend to his duties as vice-president,\r\nand resigned.\r\n\r\nIn 1870 the Company celebrated its tenth birthday by issuing\r\n$10,000 of new stock pro rata to the old shareholders, and in\r\n1873 $200,000 more was allotted at par.\r\n\r\nFor many years matters went along smoothly and quietly until the\r\ntwenty-sixth annual meeting, in 1886, when an event occurred\r\nwhich subsequently meant a good deal for the Company, although\r\nlittle noticed at the time. This was the election of the present\r\npresident, Hon. L.J. Forget, as a director. The board of\r\ndirectors was as follows:--\r\n\r\nJesse Joseph, president; Alex. Murray, vice-president, Dr. W.H.\r\nHingston, Hugh McLennan, and L.J. Forget.\r\n\r\nDuring all this time the mileage of the Company had not increased\r\nvery greatly, only amounting to 12½ miles by 1892, although St.\r\nDenis Street had been double tracked in 1891. At this time the\r\nCompany was operating eighty-two regular sleighs during the\r\nwinter season.\r\n\r\nThe year, 1892, however, marked the most important period in\r\nthe Company’s history, the beginning of the electric era,\r\nwhich has produced such wonderful results in the past two\r\ndecades.[3] It was not without violent opposition that the\r\nsubject was discussed. Several directors supported by many of\r\nthe shareholders declared that the thing was impossible and\r\nwould ruin the Company, and some of the directors even went to\r\nthe length of resigning rather than countenance such a project.\r\nSo if the first directors of the Company, in 1861, were men of\r\ncourage and enterprise, how much more so were those who backed up\r\nthe change to electricity in face of the great cost and doubtful\r\noutcome.\r\n\r\nAt the adjourned special meeting of Tuesday, May 17th, 1892,\r\nthere being present Mr. H. McLennan, vice-president; Dr. W.H.\r\nHingston and L.J. Forget, a tender for electric car service was\r\nsubmitted and considered clause by clause and finally approved\r\nof and adopted and ordered to be transmitted to the city clerk,\r\ntogether with the sum of $25,000.00 deposit.\r\n\r\nThe city accepted the Company’s terms, and the work of\r\nelectrifying the service was started without delay.\r\n\r\nThe president and directors at this period were--\r\n\r\nJesse Joseph, president; Hugh McLennan, vice-president; L.J.\r\nForget, H.A. Everett, Dr. W.H. Hingston, and associated with them\r\nin the enterprise was William Mackenzie, of Toronto.\r\n\r\nThe conversion of the system into one operated by electricity\r\nwas commenced in 1892, and the work was especially interesting\r\nin this city, owing to the climatic difficulties to be overcome.\r\nMeteorological records had shown that the average snowfall for\r\neach of the sixteen winters from 1875 to 1891 was 118 inches; the\r\ngreatest fall of 173 inches, or over 14 feet, taking place in the\r\nwinter of 1886-7.\r\n\r\nAnother exceptional difficulty was that of grades. For instance\r\nAmherst Street rises 50 feet in a distance of 800 feet; St. Denis\r\nStreet rises 47 feet in a distance of 700 feet; St. Lawrence\r\nStreet rises 68 feet in a distance of 1,500 feet; Beaver Hall\r\nHill, 60 feet in a distance of 900 feet; and Windsor Street, 70\r\nfeet in a distance of 1,500 feet; while on Guy Street and Cote\r\ndes Neiges Hill there is a rise of 350 feet in a distance of\r\n5,150 feet, with a maximum grade of 11 per cent for about 100\r\nfeet.\r\n\r\nBefore the introduction of electricity, the negotiation of some\r\nof these grades was almost a cruelty to animals, while upon other\r\nroutes now readily, safely and quickly traversed, the old horse\r\ncar service would have been an impossibility.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE EVOLUTION OF THE STREET CAR]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: “Round-the-Mountain” sight-seeing car]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Sleigh used in winter--Horse car period]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: “Pay as You Enter” car now in use]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Ordinary horse car in use prior to 1892]\r\n\r\nThe progress under the electric regime was immediate and\r\nwonderful, and the business of the Company grew in such manner as\r\nto enforce frequent increases in its capital, while dividends at\r\nthe rate of 8% per annum were paid.\r\n\r\nBy 1895 the capital stock of the Company had increased to\r\n$4,000,000, with bonds of $973,333.33. In 1897 it was increased\r\nto $5,000,000, and in that year Mr. G.C. Cunningham resigned\r\nas director, manager and chief engineer. Later Mr. R.B. Angus\r\nreplaced him as a director and Mr. F.L. Wanklyn as manager and\r\nchief engineer.\r\n\r\nIn 1901 the Company purchased all the bonds and a majority of the\r\nstock of the Montreal Park and Island Railway Company. In the\r\nsame year the Company secured franchises from the towns of St.\r\nLouis and St. Paul, both now part of Montreal.\r\n\r\nIn the following year the Company issued $1,500,000 4½% bonds to\r\npay for the Park and Island Railway. The capital at this time was\r\n$6,000,000, and no less than fourteen miles of new track were\r\nbuilt and put into operation.\r\n\r\nIn 1903 another $1,000,000 of stock was issued.\r\n\r\nMr. James Ross resigned as vice-president and managing director,\r\nduring this year, and was replaced by Mr. F.L. Wanklyn, later in\r\nthat year Mr. Wanklyn resigned and Mr. K.W. Blackwell was elected\r\nvice-president, and Mr. W.G. Ross managing director. Mr. Duncan\r\nMcDonald was appointed manager and Mr. Patrick Dubee secretary.\r\nThe Company, pursuing its policy of rapid extension, secured a\r\nfranchise in Delorimier (now part of Montreal), and an extension\r\nof their Westmount franchise. Also through another subsidiary\r\ncompany, the Suburban Tramway and Power Company, now The Public\r\nService Corporation, they secured a franchise to Longue Pointe\r\nand the Village of Beaurivage.\r\n\r\nIn the following year, the Company secured an extension of the\r\nMaisonneuve franchise, and bought considerable property on St.\r\nDenis Street for building purposes.\r\n\r\nIn 1906, the Company entered into an agreement for the purchase\r\nof the stock and bonds of the Montreal Terminal Company, and\r\nalso secured a franchise in Outremont, for the further extension\r\nof its system into the suburbs. By this time the capital stock\r\nhad grown to $7,000,000. The purchase of the Montreal Terminal\r\nCompany was concluded in the following year, while considerable\r\nadditions and extensions were made, and to meet the increased\r\ndemands the capital stock was increased to $9,000,000.\r\n\r\nThe Park and Island Company also secured a franchise in Notre\r\nDame de Grâce, and started an extension of the Sault-au-Recollet\r\nline to opposite St. Vincent de Paul. The Cartierville line was\r\nalso double tracked to the bridge.\r\n\r\nIn 1908 $292,000 debenture bonds were redeemed, and £460,000\r\n($2,238,666.67) debenture bonds, and another $1,000,000 of stock,\r\nwere issued, bringing its capital up to $10,000,000 stock and\r\n$4,420,000 bonds where it stands today.\r\n\r\nIn 1910 the Company was capitalized at $10,000,000 stock\r\nand $4,420,000 bonds, operated over 144 miles of track, and\r\ncontrolled and operated subsidiary companies with some eighty-six\r\nmiles of track, a total of 230 miles. On March 24, 1911, an\r\nact to incorporate the Montreal Tramways Company saw a new\r\ndevelopment, the incorporators of the charter being, E.A. Robert\r\n(president), J.W. McConnell (vice president), F. Howard Wilson\r\n(vice president), Hon. J. M. Wilson, Wm. C. Finley, J.M.\r\nMcIntyre, Geo. G. Foster, K.C., D.L. McGibbon and N. Curry.\r\n\r\nAs an indication of the growth of the passenger service the\r\naccount for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1914, gave the gross\r\nearnings as $7,147,804.19, the operating expenses, $4,206,114.57\r\nand the net earnings as $2,936,689.62 while the total number\r\nof passengers carried, including “transfers” was 58,120,066.\r\nSuch a story of rapid progress in the face of natural and other\r\nobstacles is one of which both the Company and the city may\r\nreasonably feel proud.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[1] The two-cent rate of the United States was introduced into\r\nCanada in 1899.\r\n\r\n[2] The “pay as you enter” cars originated in Montreal on the\r\ninvention of Mr. Duncan McDonald, of the Montreal Street Railway\r\nCompany.\r\n\r\n[3] The rapid growth of the city in population dates from 1891.\r\n1861, City and suburbs, 101,439; 1872, 155,865; 1881, 178,237;\r\n1891, 261,302; 1901, 376,402; 1910, 600,000.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                          CHAPTER XLII\r\n\r\n                            1760-1841\r\n\r\n                CITY IMPROVEMENT FROM THE CESSION\r\n\r\n                   UNDER JUSTICES OF THE PEACE\r\n\r\n  EARLY STREET REGULATIONS--A PICTURE OF MONTREAL HOUSES IN\r\n    1795--FURTHER STREETS OPENED--A “CITY PLAN” MOVEMENT IN\r\n    1799--HOUSES AT THE BEGINNING OF THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY--MAP\r\n    OF 1801--CITY WALLS TO BE DEMOLISHED--CITADEL HILL\r\n    REMOVED--FURTHER IMPROVEMENTS--ROAD COMMISSIONERS--PICTURE\r\n    OF 1819--IMPROVEMENTS DURING THE TRANSITIONAL PERIOD OF THE\r\n    JUSTICES AND THE MUNICIPALITY--PICTURE OF 1839 BY BOSWORTH.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn view of chronicling the efforts of the past, since the\r\nCession, to make the city comfortable for the dweller and\r\nattractive to the visitor, the reader is now offered the\r\nfollowing notes:\r\n\r\nIn 1676 an ordinance provided that each tenant should pave up to\r\nthe middle of the road, every street passing by his home, but\r\nthis was scarcely attended to and at the time of the British\r\nrégime these regulations were in desuetude.\r\n\r\nThe earliest ordinances governing city improvement have already\r\nbeen mentioned in the ordinances of Governors Gage and Burton.\r\nThose following on the great fire of 1765 have also been treated\r\nelsewhere.\r\n\r\nIn the letter of an English traveller, dated March 22, 1795,\r\noccurs the following reference to Montreal: “Montreal is not\r\nequal in size to Quebec, but has considerably the advantage\r\nin point of cleanliness. On the whole Montreal has more the\r\nappearance of a middle sized country town in England than any\r\nplace I saw in America. The principal streets are flagged.\r\nThe houses are built of stone, on the French plan, with this\r\nexception that they are in general, much lower and present a\r\ngreater appearance of neatness than French houses usually do.\r\n* * * The amusements of Montreal are exactly similar to those\r\nof Quebec. In winter, all is dance and festivity. * * * I have\r\nseen few places where a veteran officer of moderate income might\r\nentrench himself for life better than at Montreal.” (Canadian\r\nAntiquarian and Numismatic Journal, Vol. IX.)\r\n\r\nIn order to provide for a uniformity in the planning of the\r\nstreets to meet the growth of the city and the suburbs the\r\nlegislature by an act of 1799 (36 George IV, Cap. 5) authorized\r\nthe appointment of a surveyor “who should draw plans of the city\r\nand land adjacent and that commodious streets should be opened\r\nand ground reserved for public squares.” At the same time an act\r\nwas passed for the repairing and the changing of the roads and\r\nbridges of the country. Montreal was affected by this and was\r\ntaxed accordingly.\r\n\r\n“The houses at the beginning of this century,” says Mr. P.S.\r\nMurphy, writing in 1879, “were generally of ‘rubble masonry,’ or\r\nof wood, one or two stories high--the former with iron shutters.\r\nSome houses on St. Paul Street were two or three stories high,\r\nof Ashlar masonry. The buildings in the old city proper were\r\ngenerally of stone.”\r\n\r\nAt this period Simon McTavish’s castle was standing. He had died\r\nin 1805 and left it unfinished. There it stood deserted on the\r\nsite now covered partially by the Allan property till the latter\r\npart of December, 1860--the abode of ghosts according to the\r\ncredulous.\r\n\r\nIn 1800 Beaver Hall, the mansion of Joseph Frobisher, one of the\r\nfounders of the North West Company, was built. It was then far in\r\nthe country. Being of wood it was burned down in 1845.\r\n\r\nA badly preserved map of the city of this period (1801), made by\r\nLouis Charland, inspector of roads, reveals that certain streets’\r\nnames were applied to localities since renamed. St. Marie was\r\nthat given to the present Sherbrooke Street; St. James to St.\r\nCatherine; Dorchester to St. Jean Baptiste. The present names\r\nbegin to appear in the map of 1825 by John Adams.\r\n\r\nIn 1800 an engineer was named by the legislature with a salary\r\nof £200 a year to direct the opening of new streets, and with\r\njurisdiction beyond the city limits. The new engineer set to\r\nwork to pave St. Paul and Notre Dame streets and then to open\r\nup others under the direction of the magistrates. In 1815 the\r\nroad across the property of Etienne Guy was opened. In 1817 the\r\nopening was legalized of King, Queen, Prince, George, Nazareth\r\nand St. Gabriel streets. St. Paul Street was extended to McGill\r\nStreet and St. Maurice Street was opened. In 1818 St. Helen,\r\nLemoine and Dubord were opened. At the same time the construction\r\nof the fashionable esplanade of the period, the Champ de Mars,\r\nwas begun and the demolition of the citadel erected under the\r\nFrench régime allowed Notre Dame Street later to be extended to\r\nSt. Mary Street.\r\n\r\nIn 1802 His Majesty assented to the last reserved acts regarding\r\nthe removal of the walls around the city of Montreal. In 1801\r\na bill for the removal of walls was passed by the legislature,\r\nwith some amendments, but reserved by Sir Robert Milnes in case\r\nany further consideration from a military point of view might\r\nbe thought necessary. On the 10th of June, 1803, a proclamation\r\nwas issued giving effect to the reserved bills. Thus at last the\r\nfortifications were to be demolished! They had been threatened\r\nmany years previously. Mr. Brymner (Archives Report for 1892)\r\ntells the story. “So far back as 1791 General Mann, then a\r\ncaptain of the Royal Engineers, reported that, while in the\r\ninfant state of the colony the works around Montreal were\r\nuseful as a protection against the Indians, they were no longer\r\nrequired for that purpose and that their ruinous condition made\r\nthem rather a nuisance than a benefit. Part of the materials of\r\nthe walls, he recommended, should be preserved, the rest to be\r\nused by filling up the ditch or for any other purpose in the\r\nreforming of the town. Citadel Hill, he considered, should be\r\nlevelled and barracks built on part of it, or by levelling the\r\nhill to any easy slope Notre Dame Street might be opened to the\r\nQuebec suburbs, forming a good entrance and a great improvement\r\nto the town. The cross streets should lead to the mountain and\r\na road be preserved along the front of the river, which in time\r\nwould form a fine quay or promenade. * * * In July, 1793, Mr.\r\nDundas approved of the removal of the walls, but directed Lord\r\nDorchester to ascertain whether the owners of the adjoining\r\nproperty had or had not the right, as they maintained, to have\r\ntheir property extended on the removal. In 1797 Prescott,\r\nlieutenant governor, informed the legislature that the petition\r\nfor the extension of the property consequent on the removal\r\nof the walls desired the assembly to take measures to prevent\r\nlitigation between owners, past and present, and stated that\r\nthe officer commanding the Royal Engineers would be directed to\r\nmake a plan of the town and fortifications, which should show\r\nthe reserves proposed to be made for the use of the crown.” In\r\nNovember, 1797, the colonial secretary wrote that the bill had\r\nbeen received and would be returned with such directions as might\r\nbe necessary, which were sent in August, 1798. The rest of the\r\nhistory has been told above.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: NOTRE DAME STREET IN 1803 The portal of the First\r\nParish Church is seen blocking the street. It was necessary to\r\ngo around the church to continue along Notre Dame to the Quebec\r\nGate. The gable of the Seminary is seen on St. Francis Xavier\r\nStreet. Between it and the portal is the cemetery gate.]\r\n\r\n“From authentic sources,” says Sandham in his History of\r\nMontreal, Past and Present, “we learn that between the years of\r\n1805 and 1816 there were sixty-four stone houses erected within\r\nthe old gates. At the latter date there were forty-five wooden\r\nhouses, of which four were erected by government during the\r\nAmerican war. In 1814 seven stone and four wooden houses were\r\nbuilt; in 1815 twenty-three of stone and twenty-one of wood;\r\nand in 1816 sixty stone and wooden houses were in the course of\r\nerection.”\r\n\r\nIn the meantime the city was developing its approaches[1] and\r\nspecial commissions were appointed. An old almanack printed at\r\nQuebec in 1815 mentions: “Trustees for improving, ordering and\r\nkeeping in repair the road from the city of Montreal to Lachine\r\nthrough the wood.” (Honourable James McGill, Honourable John\r\nRichardson, Joseph Papineau, Isaac W. Clark, Louis Gugy and Jean\r\nMarie Mondelet.) The commissioners for the removal of the old\r\nwalls of Montreal were J. McGill, J. Richardson, Jean Mondelet\r\nand L. Chaboillez. (Lachennais Bridge, Canadian Numismatic and\r\nAntiquarian Journal, Series N, Vol. I, pg. 881.)\r\n\r\nA traveler visiting the city in 1819 describes the houses\r\nand streets thus: “The first impression of the city is very\r\npleasing. In its turrets and steeples glittering with tin; in its\r\nthickly built streets stretching about one-and-a-half miles along\r\nthe river and rising gently from it; in its environs ornamented\r\nwith country houses and green fields; in the noble expanse of\r\nthe St. Lawrence sprinkled with islands; in its foaming and\r\nnoisy rapid and in the bold ridge of the mountain, which forms a\r\nback-ground to the city; we recognize all the features necessary\r\nto a rich and magnificent landscape and perceive among these\r\nindications decisive proofs of a growing inland emporium. The\r\nstreets of the city are narrow except some of the new ones. The\r\nprincipal ones are St. Paul, which is the bustling business\r\nstreet, near the river, and Notre Dame, on higher ground, more\r\nquiet, more genteel and better built. The latter street is\r\ntwenty-five feet wide and three-quarters of a mile long. Many of\r\nthe houses are constructed of rough stone coarsely pointed or\r\ndaubed with mortar and have certainly an unsightly appearance.\r\nMany of the stores and dwellings have iron plate doors and window\r\nshutters, fortified by iron frames, as a precaution against fire\r\nas well as robbery. An act of ’59, (George IV Cap. 8), obliges\r\nhouseholders of Montreal whose houses have wooden roofs to\r\nwhitewash or to paint them every two years.”\r\n\r\nPrevious to 1827 St. Paul, St. Francois Xavier, St. Sacrement,\r\nNotre Dame and others of our present business streets contained\r\nthe private residences of many of our first citizens where\r\nstores and warehouses are now only to be seen. Not half a dozen\r\nof our merchants and prominent men lived out of the old city\r\nproper, viz. from McGill Street to Dalhousie Street and back to\r\nCraig Street, which was its northern boundary. At that time and\r\neven later St. James Street and its seven galleries, a terrace\r\nof one-story buildings, were the fashionable rendezvous of the\r\nmilitary. The windows of the stores were little larger than those\r\nof the ordinary houses, but in 1839 more modern display windows\r\nwere beginning to appear. The iron shutters for protection which\r\nare still to be seen on some of the old houses even in 1914, were\r\nthen giving place to more elegant ones of wood. Puddles were\r\nallowed to remain in the street. The roads were very dusty in\r\nthe dry weather and very muddy in the wet. To remedy the former\r\nsprinkling carts were recommended and for the latter wood paving.\r\nThe streets were still badly lighted for although the old oil\r\nlamps were being superseded by gas, the city was not generally\r\nlighted.\r\n\r\nDuring all this period under the justices of the peace, it may\r\nbe remarked, that they had the power to make certain assessment\r\nfor defraying the necessary expenses of the city and to enact and\r\nenforce such by-laws for its regulation as were not inconsistent\r\nwith the statutes of the realm.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        MONTREAL IN 1839\r\n\r\nWriting in 1839 in “Hochelaga Depicta,” Mr. Newton Bosworth gives\r\nmany interesting side lights of the civic improvement of the time\r\npreceding the municipality.\r\n\r\n“An act passed the Provincial Legislature in 1832, forming\r\nMontreal into a Corporation and transferring the authority for\r\nthe Magistrates to the corporate body; but in 1836, the Act of\r\nIncorporation having expired, the Government again passed into\r\nthe hands of the Justices of the Peace.\r\n\r\n“The city is represented in the Provincial Parliament by four\r\nMembers, the East and West Wards into which it is divided,\r\nreturning two each. The period of service in the House of\r\nAssembly is four years.\r\n\r\n“Under the Corporation the city and suburbs were distributed into\r\neight wards, for the more convenient arrangement and dispatch\r\nof business. These are East and West Wards, the Wards of St.\r\nAnn, St. Joseph, St. Antoine, St. Lawrence, St. Louis, and St.\r\nMary. Another division of the city may be called the Military,\r\naccording to which the battalions of militia, which are six in\r\nnumber, are collected from the portion of the city or suburbs in\r\nwhich they reside.”\r\n\r\nSpeaking of the appearance of the town in 1839, Bosworth remarks:\r\n\r\n“Montreal, the second city in political dignity, but the first\r\nin magnitude and commercial importance, in British America, is\r\nsituated in Latitude 45° 31' North, and Longitude 73° 34' West.\r\nIncluding the suburbs it covers about 1,020 acres, although\r\nwithin the fortifications the area did not much exceed 100 acres.\r\nIts local advantages for the purposes of trade, giving it a\r\ndecided superiority over every other place in the Province,\r\nand its climate, though severe, is more genial than that of\r\nQuebec. On approaching it either on the river from below, or in\r\ndescending from La Prairie, the tall and elegant steeple of the\r\nEnglish Church, the massive grandeur of the French Cathedral,\r\nthe spires of other churches and chapels, the spreading mass of\r\nhabitations in the suburbs, and the well built and lofty stores\r\nin Commissioner Street, the stranger will be impressed with a\r\nvery favourable idea of the city he is about to enter. If the\r\nentrance be by the Lachine road, a fine view of the city is\r\npresented just before descending the hill near the Tanneries, or\r\nthe village of St. Henry; and another on coming along the road\r\nfrom Mile-end, north west of the city. * * * In the commencement\r\nof towns and villages, when no specific plan has been previously\r\narranged, houses and other buildings will be erected where land\r\ncan be obtained or convenience may dictate, without much regard\r\nto regularity or order; and hence in towns of any considerable\r\nstanding, we generally find that the earliest streets are crooked\r\nand irregular. This may be seen in St. Paul Street in this city,\r\nwhich by its contiguity to the river, presents great facilities\r\nfor trade, and, with the space between it and the wharf, would be\r\noccupied in preference by men of business.\r\n\r\n“It contains many excellent houses, which would be seen to more\r\nadvantage, had the street been wider. It reminds one of some of\r\nthe central streets in London, but without their fog and smoke.\r\nFrom St. Paul Street, downwards to the river, was formerly called\r\nthe lower town, and the rest of the city the upper; but though\r\nin some of the cross streets there is an evident rising in the\r\nground, in others it is scarcely perceptible. The principal\r\nstreets are airy, and the new ones particularly of a commodious\r\nwidth; some of them running the whole length of the town, nearly\r\nparallel to the river, are intersected by others generally at\r\nright angles.\r\n\r\n“An Englishman when he enters the city, and in his perambulations\r\nthrough nearly the extent of it, is struck with the French names\r\nby which nearly the whole formerly, and the greater part now, of\r\nthe streets are distinguished; the names of Catholic Saints, or\r\neminent Frenchmen, will meet his eye in abundance.\r\n\r\n“The Rue Notre Dame, extending from the Quebec to the Recollet\r\nSuburbs, is 1,344 yards in length and thirty feet broad. It is\r\nin general a handsome street, and contains many of the public\r\nbuildings. St. James Street, Craig Street and McGill Street, are\r\nof still greater width, and when the yet empty spaces in each\r\nare filled up with elegant houses, they will be ornaments to\r\nthe town. * * * The spirit of local improvement has long been\r\nin active and efficient operation and betrays no symptoms of\r\nlangour or decline. Beside a multitude of new and elegant houses\r\nin almost every part of the city and suburbs, large spaces and\r\nseveral streets have been considerably improved.\r\n\r\n“The covering of the creek, or rather ditch, an offensive and\r\ndangerous nuisance, in Craig Street; the levelling of McGill\r\nStreet; the improvements in Dalhousie Place, in the French\r\nSquare, and Notre Dame Street, and of that part of St. Ann\r\nSuburbs called Griffin Town, by which a large portion of swampy\r\nland has been raised and made available for building, may be\r\nadduced as specimens. The recent houses are almost universally\r\nbuilt of the grayish limestone which the vicinity of the mountain\r\naffords in abundance; the fronts of the same material, hewn and\r\nsquared; even the new stores and warehouses are finished in the\r\nsame manner.\r\n\r\n“Many of the houses are large, handsome, and in modern style, and\r\nsome of them display great taste in design.\r\n\r\n“The best houses and most of the churches are covered with plates\r\nof tin, a far better material for this purpose than the wooden\r\nshingles which are frequently used. In comparing the climate with\r\nthat of Quebec, it may be observed that in general the winter is\r\nshorter in Montreal and the cold not so intense.\r\n\r\n“In the latter city also the snow is seldom so deep, or remains\r\nso long, as in Quebec.\r\n\r\n“The favourable situation of Montreal enables her to command\r\nthe trade of a considerable portion of the lower Province, and\r\nthe greater part of the upper. Her position, indeed, is such as\r\nalways to ensure a profitable connection with every part of the\r\ncontinent where business is to be done.\r\n\r\n“By some persons it has been thought, however favourable the\r\nsituation of Montreal is at present, it would have been better\r\nhad the city been founded a little lower down the river, so\r\nthat the difficulty of ascending the current of St. Mary might\r\nhave been avoided. The aid of steam navigation, however, by\r\nwhich ships of all burdens may easily be towed up to the city,\r\nrenders this a consideration of much less importance than it was\r\nformerly.\r\n\r\n“The civil government of Montreal is administered by Justices of\r\nthe Peace, who are appointed by the Governor of the Province.\r\nThey are at present forty-six in number, and have the power to\r\nmake certain assessments for defraying the necessary expenses of\r\nthe city and to enact and enforce such by-laws for its regulation\r\nand advantage as are not inconsistent with the statutes of the\r\nrealm. For a short period the municipal affairs of the city were\r\nmanaged by a Mayor and Common Council.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: VIEW OF THE CHAMP DE MARS, MONTREAL, 1830]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: From a sketch taken by John Murray and engraved by\r\nBourne ABOUT 1845 Notre Dame Street, looking east from St. John\r\nStreet.

The date of this\r\nfirst market goes back as far as 1680. Under the English régime\r\nwith the growth of the city the provision of further markets was\r\nfurther foreseen. The second market, between Notre Dame Street\r\nand St. Paul Street, was placed on the site originally occupied\r\nby the Château de Vaudreuil, which became the Collège de St.\r\nRaphaël, burnt in the great fire of 1803. An ordinance of 1807[1]\r\n(47 George III, Chap. VII) gave authority to borrow to the amount\r\nof £2,500 for construction of the market, which, however, was\r\ndelayed for a time. In 1821 a new wing was added. The building\r\nwas in wood and was demolished to be replaced by the Bonsecours\r\nMarket in 1843, and its site, the Jacques Cartier Square of\r\ntoday, served for a public place.\r\n\r\nThe “new” market, Bonsecours, was established under the\r\nregulation of the city council of 1841 (May 22d). It was designed\r\nalso to be the seat of the Council. It is in the Grecian Doric\r\nstyle of architecture. Its site is partially that of the\r\nintendant’s palace and that of the house of Sir John Johnson,\r\ncommander of the Indians in the American Revolution, and son of\r\nSir William Johnson, the Indian warrior. In 1845 the market at\r\nSt. Lawrence and St. Dominique streets was also built. Other\r\nmarkets have followed in the following order:\r\n\r\n  1830--The first St. Ann’s Market owed its origin to the\r\n        initiative of some private citizens who furnished the\r\n        capital to the amount of nearly fifteen thousand pounds.\r\n        It was afterwards leased to the government and became the\r\n        house of parliament.\r\n\r\n  1830--About 1830 the market of Près de Ville on the north of Coté\r\n        Street, near Chenneville and Vitré streets, was erected,\r\n        but abolished in 1839.\r\n\r\n  1840--Viger, in St. James ward, bounded by Campeau, Craig, Dubord\r\n        and St. Hubert; constructed in 1861; demolished in 1893.\r\n\r\n  1845--Papineau Market, on Papineau Road, between Craig and\r\n        Lagauchetière; reconstructed in 1855; demolished in 1890.\r\n\r\n  1851--St. Ann’s Market, built on the site of the old parliament\r\n        house, burnt down in 1849, in the rebel losses riots. It\r\n        was demolished in 1900. Its site is now preserved by the\r\n        gardens of Youville Square.\r\n\r\n  1860--St. Gabriel, bounded by Centre Street, Richmond, Richardson\r\n        and Montmorency streets; abolished in 1900.\r\n\r\n  1865--St. Antoine, bounded by St. James, Mountain, Aqueduct and\r\n        Adeline streets.\r\n\r\n  1865--The Haymarket, bounded by St. Paul, Inspector, William\r\n        streets and Nolan Park.\r\n\r\n  1870--St. Jean Baptiste, bounded by St. Lawrence, Rachel, St.\r\n        Dominique and Market streets.\r\n\r\n  1871--St. James, bounded by Ontario, Amherst, Wolfe and Houle.\r\n\r\n  1885--Cattle Market (East), at the head of Frontenac Street.\r\n\r\n  1885--Cattle Market (West), originally situated at St. Henri and\r\n        removed in 1902 to St. Etienne Street (Point St. Charles).\r\n\r\n  1890--Weighing Station (Papineau), corner of Craig and Notre Dame\r\n        streets.\r\n\r\n  1890--Weighing Station (St. Denis), corner of Carrière and Berri\r\n        streets.\r\n\r\n  1890--Weighing Station (Hochelaga), on Desery Street between\r\n        St. Catherine and Notre Dame Street. (In 1896 this became\r\n        a fire station and later a repairing shop for fire\r\n        appliances.)\r\n\r\nIn 1810 the regulations enforced by the magistrates concerning\r\ntrade were reunited and sanctioned by the court of king’s\r\nbench. It is there decreed, among other things, that leathers,\r\nshoes, fish, meat, sugar, tobacco, cloths brought in by the\r\n“cultivateurs” should only be sold at certain places in the town\r\nunder penalty of 5 shillings. The sale of fruit and vegetables\r\nwas permitted on the streets. Other merchandise was forbidden\r\nto be sold on the street in order to prevent the obstruction\r\nof passage and the sale of them by auction which was reserved\r\nfor market days. The slaughtering of animals was forbidden and\r\nthere are other regulations pertaining to the cleanliness of the\r\nstreets. That part of the water front from the northeast limit of\r\nthe Montreal bridge to about opposite St. Victor Street, near the\r\nchurch of Bonsecours was declared the port for building and fire\r\nwood, with the exception of 100 feet reserved at the entrance of\r\nthe new market for the bateaux, chaloupes, barges, and canoes\r\nbringing provisions to the markets.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GROUP FROM THE KING EDWARD MONUMENT]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: L.P. Hébert EDWARD THE PEACEMAKER Erected 1914]\r\n\r\n\r\n                          PUBLIC PLACES\r\n\r\nThe movement for public squares was encouraged by His Excellency,\r\nGovernor Lord Dalhousie, in 1821, when he gave the piece of\r\nground on which Citadel Hill had so long stood, with its powder\r\nmagazine. It was called Dalhousie Square. It is now covered by\r\nthe Viger station tracks. The earth from the citadel was carted\r\nto the Champ de Mars to increase its size and to build it up.\r\n\r\nThe municipality, after the reestablishment of the corporation\r\nin 1840, turned its attention to the acquisition of more public\r\nplaces to meet the growth in population. The following is the\r\nhistory of the present parks or squares under the régime of the\r\ncorporation of Montreal:\r\n\r\nCustom House Square, now called Place Royale, the original Place\r\nd’Armes, Market Place and meeting ground of Montreal, was bought\r\nfrom Mr. William Dow on the 4th of April, 1845, at the price of\r\n$2,400.\r\n\r\nJacques Cartier Square, between Notre Dame and St. Paul streets,\r\noriginally given to the city by virtue of an act of 1808 for\r\nthe establishment of a market which was built and afterwards\r\nwas taken down when Bonsecours Market was completed, was first\r\nused for its present purpose about 1845. The Nelson Monument was\r\nerected on this square in 1809.\r\n\r\nPlace d’Armes Square, opposite the Notre Dame Cathedral, had\r\nalways been used as a public place from the early days of\r\nthe French régime. In 1836 it was purchased by the city from\r\nthe Gentlemen of the Seminary. In 1845 the city inclosed it\r\nand leveled the ground and paved the street around it. It\r\nhas undergone several changes. The Maisonneuve Monument by\r\nPhilippe Hébert was placed in the centre on June 24, 1895, and\r\nthe railings have been removed and the whole square cemented\r\nduring the last three or four years. This monument was erected\r\nto celebrate the two hundred and fiftieth anniversary of the\r\nfounding of the city by Paul de Chomedey de Maisonneuve. On\r\nthe question of a statue being raised, a delegation from the\r\nNumismatic and Antiquarian Society, consisting of de Léry\r\nMacdonald, W.D. Lighthall, D.J. Beaudry and the Vicomte H. de la\r\nBarthe, presented to Mayor James McShane on April 23, 1891, a\r\ndetailed scheme of placques and bas-reliefs for a great monument.\r\nThis was ratified by the council. The Maisonneuve Committee,\r\npresided over by Judge Pagnuelo, eventually adopted with slight\r\nmodifications, the scheme of designs suggested by the above\r\nArchaeological Society.\r\n\r\nChamp de Mars belongs to the Imperial government for military\r\nparades. It was originally but a small piece of ground situated\r\nin one of the bastions of the old town walls; when these were\r\npulled down it was enlarged. In 1839 it formed a space of 227 by\r\n114 yards and was one of the fashionable promenades. The parapet\r\nstone railing overlooking Craig Street was erected in 1913.\r\n\r\nVictoria Square was bought in 1841 to increase the Haymarket then\r\nheld there. It was then called Commissioner’s Square. It received\r\nits present name in 1860 on the occasion of the visit of Prince\r\nAlbert Edward (Edward VII). The southern portion situated between\r\nCraig and St. James streets belonged to the city since 1825,\r\nexcept the strip on the west side, which was expropriated in 1888.\r\n\r\nPhillips Square and Beaver Hall Square were ceded to the town in\r\n1842 by Mr. Alfred Phillips. In September of 1914, the Statue of\r\nKing Edward the Peacemaker, designed by Philippe Hébert, was\r\nunveiled by his brother, the Governor General of Canada, H.R.H.\r\nthe Duke of Connaught.\r\n\r\nViger Garden, or Viger Square, was ceded to the city gratuitously\r\nin 1844 by Jacques Viger and P. LaCroix. It has been added to\r\nsince. The site of this garden was originally a swamp or marsh\r\nand on an old map of 1758 it is marked as such. A portion of the\r\nsquare was used as a cattle market for many years. For years\r\nafter its establishment as a public garden it was the principal\r\nsquare of the city where people congregated to hear the military\r\nbands two or three evenings every week.\r\n\r\nRichmond Square has belonged to the city since 1844.\r\n\r\nParthenais Square was established in 1845 on a portion of ground\r\nbelonging to the city. It was added to in 1858 by a piece\r\npurchased by Mr. McGill.\r\n\r\nPapineau Square, established before 1845, was at first called\r\nQueen’s Square. Its new name was given by the council in 1890.\r\n\r\nLafontaine Park was bought by the Federal government on October\r\n29, 1845, from Mr. James Logan, a merchant who had it from his\r\nfather. This land was made part of the property commonly called\r\nPapineau or Monarch Farm. This property, owned by the federal\r\ngovernment with the exception of a little strip, bounded by\r\nRachel and Lafontaine Park, and a piece situated in the east of\r\nthe Jacques Cartier Normal School has been left to the city for\r\nninety-nine years on certain conditions for $1.00 a year. One of\r\nthese is that the government can end the loan at any time, and\r\nanother is the right to reserve for military purposes that part\r\nof the park situated to the north of Sherbrooke Street and to the\r\neast of Panet Street. The city conservatories originally erected\r\non Viger Garden in 1865 were reconstructed on Lafontaine Park in\r\n1889.\r\n\r\nWellington Square was bought from the Gentlemen of the Seminary\r\nin 1856.\r\n\r\nSt. Gabriel Square was bought in 1862, but its history as a\r\npublic garden does not begin till 1893.\r\n\r\nWestern Square was bought as a public park from the gentlemen of\r\nthe Seminary on December 31, 1870.\r\n\r\nCherrier Square, known under the name of St. Jean Baptiste\r\nSquare, was acquired in 1870 and became a public park in 1875.\r\n\r\nDufferin Square, which had been a Protestant cemetery since 1799,\r\nwas expropriated as a public park in 1871.\r\n\r\nMount Royal Park, the property of several owners, was originally\r\nexpropriated at a cost of $1,000,000 in 1872. In 1875 Mr.\r\nFrederick Law Olmsted, a landscape architect from the United\r\nStates, was entrusted with the preparation of a general plan for\r\nMount Royal.\r\n\r\nFletcher’s Field, attached to this site, also dates its history\r\nto this period.\r\n\r\nDominion Square, hitherto the Catholic cemetery, was similarly\r\nexpropriated in 1873.\r\n\r\nSt. Helen’s Island, in the St. Lawrence, and so named after his\r\nwife, Helène Bouillé, by Samuel Champlain, was established as a\r\npublic park in 1874. Its extent is 128 acres.\r\n\r\nBellerive Square, established in 1880, became the property of the\r\ncity definitely in 1893.\r\n\r\nSt. James Square, up to 1886 part of the St. James Market, became\r\na public place in this year.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LAFONTAINE PARK]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ST. LOUIS SQUARE]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DOMINION SQUARE]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: VIGER SQUARE]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLACE D’ARMES]\r\n\r\nNolan Square (Haymarket Square) was established as a park in\r\n1896 on a part of the second Haymarket. This land was originally\r\nbought from the seminary in 1865.\r\n\r\nGallery Square was established as a public place in 1898.\r\n\r\nYouville Square, so called from Madame d’Youville, who founded\r\nthe Grey Nun’s Hospital originally adjacent, was transformed into\r\na public space on the site of the old parliament building and\r\nafterwards St. Ann’s Market.\r\n\r\nIn 1913 parks were ceded to the city at Rosemount, Longue Pointe,\r\nand in 1914 in the St. Marys, Hochelaga, St. Denis, Notre Dame de\r\nGrâces, and Bordeaux Wards.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           CEMETERIES\r\n\r\nIn the first volume the origin of the earliest cemeteries of Montreal\r\nhas been traced. To resume; the first cemetery was established in\r\n1643 at the southeast corner of the fort inclosure, known later as\r\n“Pointe a Callières,” today commemorated by a tablet on the present\r\ncustom house building. The second was established in 1654 in the\r\nvicinity of the grounds of the Hôtel Dieu on St. Joseph Street\r\n(afterwards St. Sulpice Street), and was called the “Hospital\r\nCemetery.” It occupied part of the ground occupied by the Place\r\nd’Armes and the present Notre Dame Cathedral. There was a mortuary\r\nchapel to receive the bodies which stood on the present site of the\r\nBank of Montreal, and although the hospital cemetery had ceased to\r\nbe in use in 1799 the chapel was not destroyed till 1816, when it\r\nwas given over by the Fabrique of Notre Dame to the commissioners\r\nof fortifications of the city for the enlargement of St. James\r\nStreet. Meanwhile a subsidiary cemetery, the third, was acquired\r\nabout 1749 “on a site belonging to Mr. Robert near the powder\r\nmagazine, containing about a quarter of an arpent in superfices.”\r\nIt was granted at the request of the curé and the church warden of\r\nNotre Dame by the Marquis de la Galissonière, governor, and François\r\nBigot, the intendant, as follows:\r\n\r\n“Vue la requête, nous autorisons le curé et les marguilliers de\r\nla paroisse de cette ville (Montréal) à faire l’acquisition des\r\nterrains ci-dessous désignés pour servir à inhumer les pauvres de\r\nla dite paroisse.\r\n\r\n                                  “(Signé) LA GALISSONIERE\r\n                                              BIGOT.”\r\n\r\nBy 1751 it was resolved to inclose it with a stone wall and\r\nto build a mortuary to house the bodies during the winter.\r\nIn 1799 the hospital cemeteries and the powder magazine were\r\ndiscontinued. At this period the grand juries, recognizing that\r\nthese cemeteries so near to the dwellings were unhealthy and a\r\nmenace to the public health, addressed a report to the Procurator\r\nGeneral Sewell asking for their removal. The latter approached\r\nthe Fabrique and it was resolved to seek for other lands. An old\r\nplan of the powder magazine cemetery shows that it ran from St.\r\nPeter Street, taking in a portion of St. James Street, and the\r\nblock of buildings occupied by the Canada Life Building and the\r\nCanadian Bank of Commerce and terminating in Fortification Lane\r\nat the city wall.[2] This cemetery was that used by Protestants\r\nand Catholics alike. Historically it may be called the first\r\ncemetery for Protestants.\r\n\r\nAt this same period there was already a Jewish cemetery in a lot\r\non St. Janvier Street, near the present Dominion Square. The\r\ndeed of sale was signed by the congregation of “Shearith Israel”\r\nin 1775, and the first interment was that of Lazarus David on\r\nOctober 22, 1776.[3] This was the first Jewish cemetery on the\r\nAmerican continent.\r\n\r\nThe more remote site chosen for the next cemetery was that\r\nbelonging to Pierre Guy in Coteau St. Louis and the St. Antoine\r\nsuburbs, and covered four arpents. St. Anthony cemetery, as\r\nit was called, occupied a part of Dominion Square of today.\r\nAn increase of ground was subsequently added on the part now\r\noccupied by the Archbishop’s Cathedral. This cemetery was used\r\ntill 1854, when again its nearness to dwellings caused its\r\nremoval to the slopes of Mount Royal.\r\n\r\nFor long the Protestant community had been desirous of its\r\nown exclusive burial ground. In 1799 a meeting was held in\r\nthe courthouse on the 21st of June, when for the purpose\r\nof purchasing a piece of ground on Dorchester Street for a\r\nProtestant burying ground, Messrs. Edward W. Gray, Isaac W.\r\nClarke, Arthur Davidson, John Russell, and William Hunter were\r\nchosen trustees. On the 15th of June, 1811, an order was issued\r\nfor all bodies to be removed from the old cemetery before the\r\n7th of July. In 1824 a considerable addition to the cemetery\r\nwas made. The site is preserved today as Dufferin Square. It\r\ncontinued to serve its purpose as the “old” Protestant cemetery\r\ntill about 1847. Many prominent Englishmen were buried here, such\r\nas the Hon. James McGill, whose body was afterward transferred to\r\nMcGill College grounds. In 1871 it was expropriated as a public\r\nplace.\r\n\r\nThe transition of the Protestant cemetery from Dorchester Street\r\nto Mount Royal may be now briefly told. Somewhere about 1845 or\r\n1846 it was felt that the Dorchester Street burying ground was\r\nbecoming overcrowded and a body known as the Montreal Cemetery\r\nCompany incorporated with a charter granted in 1847 obtained\r\nsome land at the top of Coté des Neiges Hill on property\r\nbelonging to a Mr. Furness. A few burials only took place here\r\nas circumstances rendered it unsuitable. The project was then\r\nabandoned, and public meetings were held to obtain a more\r\nappropriate site. The Montreal Cemetery Company was succeeded\r\nby another incorporated by 16 Victoria, Cap. 56 (1852) under\r\nthe name of the Mount Royal Cemetery Company. This company of\r\nstockholders has developed a beautiful mountain cemetery so that\r\nit may be considered one of the parks of Montreal and its garden\r\nof sleep.\r\n\r\nThe first interment in the Mount Royal Cemetery was that of the\r\nReverend Mr. Squires, who died of cholera in 1852. Since 1910 an\r\nadditional cemetery has been added in connection with the Mount\r\nRoyal Cemetery Company, situated at Hawthornedale on the road to\r\nBout de l’Ile.\r\n\r\nThe purchase of Mount Royal cemetery for the various Protestant\r\ndenominations of Montreal was followed, by that of Notre Dame\r\ndes Neiges adjoining, by the Catholic community. A committee\r\nof five appointed on July 17, 1853, to find a suitable location\r\nfor a cemetery reported to the Fabrique of Notre Dame Cathedral\r\non July 31st the desirability of acquiring 115 arpents of land\r\non Coté des Neiges Road belonging to Dr. Pierre Beaubien at\r\nthe price of £3,000. This land was bought, but the project of\r\nfinally settling it as a cemetery was not executed till the\r\nnext year, since in the meantime a counter proposition had been\r\ngratuitously offered by the Sulpicians at Coté St. Luc. The\r\noriginal recommendation, however, being ratified, work was begun\r\nand the cemetery was opened to the public in 1855. The cemetery\r\nwas enlarged in 1865, 1872, 1907 and 1909, and now covers\r\nover four hundred arpents of land.[4] It is being constantly\r\nbeautified, adding a beautiful garden to the adjoining mountain\r\npark. The name of Notre Dame des Neiges was chosen in remembrance\r\nof the little chapel built on the Mountain Mission under that\r\ntitle to be a souvenir of the placing of the great cross which\r\nMaisonneuve planted in 1643 on the day of the Epiphany, but which\r\nthe Iroqouis afterward destroyed. There is no doubt that this\r\nname for the chapel was chosen by Marguerite Bourgeoys, who had a\r\nspecial veneration for the shrine of that name in France. Three\r\nof her Iroquois maidens were called by her Marie des Neiges. The\r\nneighbourhood has borne the name of Coté des Neiges for the same\r\nsentimental reasons, it being said that several of the first\r\nfarmers settling there came from the district of the same French\r\nshrine.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ENTRANCE TO MOUNT ROYAL CEMETERY (PROTESTANT)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ENTRANCE TO COTE-DES-NEIGES CEMETERY (CATHOLIC)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE “CALVARY” IN COTE-DES-NEIGES CEMETERY]\r\n\r\nThe oldest Protestant cemetery in the city still existing is that\r\non Papineau Road, where in 1816 land was purchased at a cost of\r\n£500 and was known as the “new” burial grounds. A portion of the\r\nlatter, known as the military burial grounds, still exists as\r\nsuch and, owing to the efforts of the “Last Post” Association,\r\nthe federal government has lately renovated it with needful\r\nrepairs. Here there are several interesting monuments, among them\r\nbeing that of Sir Benjamin D’Urban, the first governor of Natal,\r\nwho was sent out here to take command of the troops when the\r\nfriction caused by the Oregon question threatened to bring on a\r\nwar between Great Britain and our neighbours to the south.\r\n\r\nThere is also a military burial ground at St. Helen’s Island.\r\nIt was discontinued in 1825. It is said to have been used for a\r\nhundred years and to contain between one thousand five hundred\r\nto two thousand remains. A further burial ground is preserved in\r\nmemory by the great boulder of Point Charles at the north end\r\nof the Victoria Jubilee bridge, where the fever-stricken Irish\r\nemigrants were hurriedly buried in 1847.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       OTHER IMPROVEMENTS\r\n\r\nBeyond the establishment of the public places and cemeteries\r\nduring this period other civic improvements have to be accredited\r\nto this period before Confederation.\r\n\r\nIn 1852 the laws against wooden buildings were enforced. At this\r\ntime St. Lawrence Main Street was the fashionable boulevard for\r\nthe French citizens.\r\n\r\nA review of the year 1856 says: “There has been an intense\r\nenergy manifested during the year and is still visible. The\r\nbusiness streets are being paved in the most substantial manner;\r\nthe avenues to the city and the roads in the outskirts are graded\r\nand macadamized; handsome fountains have been erected, trees\r\nare being planted out, rows of dwelling houses of elegant and\r\nsubstantial descriptions are going up in various quarters; a\r\nnumber of stores and warehouses of the largest, most substantial\r\nand at the same time most elegant kind are approaching completion.\r\nThe great wharf for ocean steamships is finished as are the railway\r\nbuildings at Point St. Charles. Labourers, mechanics, manufacturers\r\nand merchants--in a word all classes are at work with all their\r\nmight and the results make their appearance with almost magical\r\ncelerity. Nor in all this material advancement are the pulpit, the\r\npress, the college, or the school neglected.”\r\n\r\nThe year 1864 marked great building operations. No less than\r\nseven church edifices were commenced, viz., Trinity church on\r\nViger Square; the Church of the Gesu, Bleury Street; three\r\nWesleyan churches; the American Presbyterian church; Knox church\r\non Dorchester Street, and Erskine church on St. Catherine Street.\r\nThe Protestant House of Industry and Refuge, Dorchester Street,\r\nand the Molson Bank, St. James Street, complete the list of\r\npublic buildings, while in addition to these 1,019 dwelling\r\nhouses were erected.\r\n\r\nThe extension of Notre Dame from Dalhousie Square to McGill\r\nStreet was made from 1864 to 1868. Ontario Street was opened\r\nin 1864 and at the same time St. Catherine Street was extended\r\nbetween St. George and St. Lawrence streets.\r\n\r\n\r\n                PUBLIC PLACES, SQUARES AND PARKS\r\n\r\n  Wards.

A PLAN FOR “GREATER MONTREAL”--THE\r\n    HISTORY OF THE PRESENT MOVEMENT.\r\n\r\n\r\nA traveler who visited the city in the year 1868 gives a\r\ncriticism which reminds us that Montreal was now assuming\r\nmetropolitan proportions: “I was much struck by the continued\r\nrapid growth of this now great northern city. But as it is almost\r\nwholly of stone in the business portions and along the extensive\r\nand massive quays which line the banks of the river, Montreal\r\nmakes a dignified, indeed, an imposing effect. The beholder for\r\nthe first time, unless marvelously well up in his geography, is\r\nsurprised to find so large and so complete a city. To stand at a\r\nstreet corner for a moment is to see pass by the Indian woman,\r\nwrapped in her heavy blanket; the French habitant; Scotch, Irish\r\nand English residents; and emigrants of all social conditions,\r\nthe “American” from the United States; officers of the British\r\narmy in their different uniforms; Catholic priests in their\r\nrobes; Sisters of Charity; crowds of neat-looking soldiers; and\r\nthe burly policemen clad in a dark blue military uniform. The\r\nbuildings everywhere in course of erection would dignify any\r\ncity. There are none in the United States which present finer\r\nspecimens of street architecture than are found, not isolated\r\nhere and there, but in long blocks and throughout the entire\r\ncity.”\r\n\r\nSpeaking of the buildings of this period, Sandham in his Ville\r\nMarie Past and Present, remarks: “A striking feature in the\r\nprogress of the city was the number of buildings erected for\r\neducational and charitable purposes. Indeed, each year seemed to\r\nhave a peculiarity in the character of its new buildings. In 1868\r\nthe tendency was in favour of dwelling houses; the year before it\r\nwas stores; and before that again the erection of churches and\r\nreligious edifices appeared mostly to employ the energies and\r\nsurplus capital of the citizens.\r\n\r\n“The year 1869 was marked by efforts in an educational direction.\r\nThe Gentlemen of the Seminary nearly doubled the previously large\r\naccommodation at the college above Sherbrooke Street. The Roman\r\nCatholic bishop put up a large schoolhouse in Lagauchetière\r\nStreet and the Catholic school commissioners erected a schoolhouse\r\non Ontario Street and another in Fullum Street. They also erected a\r\nvery spacious school on Alexander Street opposite St. Patrick’s\r\nchurch. A very large stone structure was erected on Visitation\r\nStreet by the St. Vincent de Paul Society for educational and\r\ncharitable uses. The extensive asylum or infant school in St.\r\nCatherine Street, near Bleury, had its size doubled, a neat chapel\r\nbeing added. The St. George’s (Episcopal) church was also commenced.”\r\n\r\nThe extension of the city toward the suburbs was being\r\nfacilitated by the city railway commenced in the fall of 1861.\r\n“It is difficult,” says Sandham, writing in 1869, “to mark the\r\ndistinction between the city and the villages of the outlying\r\nmunicipalities. It is apparent that these villages must\r\neventually form part of the city and it would be advantageous if\r\nsome preparatory arrangement were to be made for assimilating the\r\nbuilding and sanitary laws of the municipalities to those of the\r\ncity.” A remark equally pertinent today when having annexed many\r\nof these “villages” we are looking forward to do the same to many\r\nmore till the city embraces the island of Montreal.\r\n\r\nIn 1867 paving and wood was adopted for Jacques Cartier Square,\r\nbut stone was adopted for the rest. The year of 1875 saw great\r\nprogress in paving, the expense of the outlay being not less than\r\n$431,090. The side paths in blue stone on St. Denis, Sherbrooke,\r\nUnion, St. Catherine and Dorchester are of this date. This period\r\nof city improvement culminated in the homologated plan of the\r\ncity still in use. The sanitary state of the city at this time\r\nwas deplorable and Dr. William Hingston, afterwards knighted,\r\nwas elected mayor for its amelioration. The construction of the\r\nchief collecting sewer on Craig Street, begun at this time,\r\nwas finished in 1878. The year 1887 saw also a regular system\r\nestablished for the removal of rubbish. All these ameliorations\r\nreduced the mortality rate very much.\r\n\r\nIn 1883 there began a series of modern suburban annexation which\r\nhas given the name of the “Greater Montreal” to our enlarging\r\ncity.\r\n\r\nIn 1883 the superficies of Montreal proper was 3,958 acres.\r\nIts population was, according to the census of 1881, 155,238\r\nsouls. Since the annexations began in 1883 there have been added\r\nup to 1910 21,767 acres. On the 4th of June, 1910, the total\r\nsuperficies of the city was 25,747.75 acres, about 40.23 square\r\nmiles, and the population was 455,000 souls. At this time the\r\nfollowing municipalities were still outside the city:\r\n\r\n  Maisonneuve            22,500 Population\r\n  Westmount              14,000 Population\r\n  Verdun                 10,500 Population\r\n  Outremont               3,000 Population\r\n  Lachine                11,000 Population\r\n  Summerlea                 500 Population\r\n  Ville St Pierre         2,000 Population\r\n  Montreal West             900 Population\r\n  St. Anne de Bellevue    2,000 Population\r\n\r\nIt is expected that Greater Montreal will include these.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE LOOKOUT AND SOME OF THE DRIVEWAYS IN MOUNT\r\nROYAL PARK]\r\n\r\nThe subjoined table of annexations since 1883 deserves to be\r\nrecorded:\r\n\r\n                           Date of           Area        Population\r\n                           annexation.

To illustrate the next\r\nperiod of fifty years of Greater Montreal the following official\r\naccount of the year 1898 is useful as a brief summary of city\r\nimprovements:\r\n\r\nHis Worship Mayor Préfontaine, wishing to give in his inaugural\r\naddress, in 1898, an idea of the progress made by Montreal,\r\nduring the past fifteen years, submitted the following figures:\r\n\r\n“The taxable property, in 1884, was $73,584,644; in 1897, the\r\nsame had reached $141,790,205; increase, $68,205,561.\r\n\r\n“The value of the property exempted from taxation in 1884 was\r\n$15,324,084; in 1897, it had reached $36,023,295; increase,\r\n$20,697,211.\r\n\r\n“In 1884, we had 133 miles of streets opened; in 1897, we had 178\r\nmiles. Increase, 45 miles.\r\n\r\n“In 1884, we had less than one-half mile of paved streets; we now\r\nhave 26½ miles.\r\n\r\n“The territory of Montreal in 1884 was 3,788 square acres; in\r\n1897, it was 6,547 square acres; increase, 2,761 square acres.\r\n\r\n“In 1884 we had about 75 miles of brick sewers; we now have 104\r\nmiles; increase, 29 miles.\r\n\r\n“The population increased during the same period of time, from\r\n172,000 to 250,000, taking the lowest estimate of the present\r\npopulation; increase, about 78,000.”\r\n\r\nFrom 1898 to 1910 the same corresponding increase of growth was\r\nmarked.\r\n\r\nAnother epoch started with the later date on the advent of the\r\nBoard of Control.\r\n\r\n\r\n         CIVIC IMPROVEMENT UNDER THE “BOARD OF CONTROL”\r\n\r\nAmong some of the outstanding civic works undertaken under the\r\ncontrol régime may be chronicled the following, as recorded in\r\nthe official reports:\r\n\r\n\r\n                       THE MEURLING REFUGE\r\n\r\nIn 1911, Mr. Gustave Meurling died at Menton, France, bequeating\r\nall his property to the City of Montreal.\r\n\r\nFollowing the correspondence between the late Mr. Meurling’s\r\nattorneys and Doctor J.J. Guerin, Mayor at the time, the\r\nConsulting City Attorney was instructed to take the necessary\r\nmeans to put the City in possession of the bequest.\r\n\r\nTo carry out the wishes of this generous benefactor, the\r\nCommissioners decided to build a refuge for the poor and\r\nhomeless, giving it his name.\r\n\r\nOn the 29th of July, 1912, a report was made to Council to\r\npurchase a property on Champ de Mars Street and to erect thereon\r\na refuge to be known as “The Meurling Municipal Refuge.” This\r\nreport was adopted by the Council on the 1st of August, 1912. An\r\narchitect was engaged to prepare the plans and specifications and\r\nthe refuge was in full operation in March, 1914. It is thoroughly\r\nequipped with the most modern appliances.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       MUNICIPAL ARCHIVES\r\n\r\nThe Commissioners decided to create a new department to be known\r\nas the Municipal Archives Department.\r\n\r\nThis action was deemed necessary, preventing the loss of\r\ndocuments, and the worry and loss of time spent in searching for\r\nthem. All documents will be in charge of one official who\r\nwill be the head of this Department. This Department came into\r\nexistence and the head official appointed in 1913.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MAP BY WARDS OF MONTREAL]\r\n\r\n\r\n                          CHAMP DE MARS\r\n\r\nIn 1911, the Board of Commissioners had plans and specifications\r\nprepared and the necessary funds were voted by Council for\r\nimprovements to the Champ de Mars.\r\n\r\nThe tenders received for this work exceeded the estimates\r\nprepared by the Public Works Department to such an extent that\r\nthe Commissioners decided that it would not be in the City’s\r\ninterest to award the contract.\r\n\r\nThe Chief Engineer was thereupon instructed to have new plans and\r\nspecifications prepared; these being prepared by Mr. F.J. Todd,\r\nArchitect. Tenders were called for and on the 10th of June, 1912,\r\nCouncil awarded the contract.\r\n\r\nThe Champ de Mars improvements, including the change of grade and\r\npaving of St. Gabriel Street, were completed during the course of\r\nthe year 1913.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         CITY HALL ANNEX\r\n\r\nIn 1910, the attention of the Commissioners was called to the\r\ncongestion existing in the offices of the Police Department,\r\nMunicipal Assistance Department, etc., and finally, in 1911, they\r\ndecided that the efficient administration of those departments\r\nrequired that they should occupy more spacious quarters.\r\n\r\nConsequently, they reported to Council for funds to purchase\r\na property on Gosford Street, between Champ de Mars and\r\nSt. Louis streets, for the site of a new building for this\r\npurpose. The report was adopted by the Council and the sum of\r\n$10,000 was voted for the preparation of the necessary plans\r\nand specifications for the erection of this building, as well\r\nas for repairs to the City Hall. Messrs. Marchand & Haskell,\r\narchitects, were engaged for this work. Tenders were called for\r\nthe construction of this building and on the 4th of June, 1912,\r\non report of the Commissioners, Council awarded the contract to\r\nMessrs. Peter Lyall & Sons. The building was ready for occupation\r\nearly in 1914.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         EXPROPRIATIONS\r\n\r\nDuring the last three years, 1910-13, many streets have been\r\nopened, widened or continued. A new system of expropriation\r\nhas been adopted since 1910 by the City. When a street is to\r\nbe widened or a new street opened up, the City is empowered to\r\npurchase the whole of a property to be expropriated, if it thinks\r\nfit, and then resell the residue. In most cases the City is\r\nreimbursed the whole of the expropriation, and in others a fair\r\nprofit is made, as for instance, in the case of opening up St.\r\nLawrence Boulevard to the River front.\r\n\r\nFor the opening of St. Lawrence Boulevard, the City purchased,\r\nfrom the Sisters of the Congregation of Notre-Dame,[1] the whole\r\nof their property for the sum of $617,350.00, at the rate of\r\n$7.34 per foot; from the McArthur Estate, the whole of their\r\nproperty for the sum of $51,050.00, at the rate of $5.03 per\r\nfoot; from the Masson Estate, a part of their property for\r\nthe sum of $22,170.00 at the rate of $6.00 per foot; the sale\r\nexpenses, etc., amounted to the sum of $7,933.08, making a total\r\nexpenditure of $698,503.08.\r\n\r\nThe City then resold a part of the Sisters’ property for\r\n$694,184.74; a part of the McArthur Estate property for\r\n$27,005.40; the sale of the building materials brought $1,936.00;\r\nthe whole proceeds of the resale amounted to $723,126.07; the\r\nCity thus realizing a net profit of $24,622.00 on the whole\r\ntransaction.\r\n\r\nTaking the prices paid by the City, as a basis, to arrive at the\r\nwhole cost of this transaction, we have part of the Sister’s\r\nproperty (36,740.2 square feet) used for the Boulevard at $7.34\r\nper foot, making a total amount of $269,677.06; part of the\r\nproperty of the Masson Estate (3,695 square feet) at $6.00 per\r\nfoot, making a total amount of $22,170.00; part of the property\r\nof the McArthur Estate (8,475 square feet) at $5.03 per foot,\r\namounting to $42,659.53; the cost of the St. Lawrence Boulevard\r\nthus amounting to the sum of $334,502.59. By adding to this\r\nsum the above mentioned amount of $24,622.99, we see that\r\nthe opening of St. Lawrence Boulevard, which was a matter of\r\npublic convenience, not only cost the City nothing, but by this\r\ntransaction, reaped a benefit of the value of $359,125.58.\r\n\r\nThese facts go to prove that while in some cases the City is\r\nobliged to purchase, in a limited time, a certain designated\r\nproperty and to pay a seemingly high price, yet in other cases\r\nwith the new system of expropriations, the City is enabled not\r\nonly to have improvements made that cost nothing, but also to\r\nmake a good profit on its investment. This method was considered\r\nby the Cities of the United States a progressive movement.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             TUNNELS\r\n\r\nIn 1913 the St. Lawrence Street tunnel, which was begun by Ville\r\nSt. Louis, was completed and open to traffic.\r\n\r\nThe Commissioners have also under consideration the building of\r\ntunnels on St. Hubert and on Wellington Streets, and the widening\r\nof the Ontario Street tunnel, and to the widening of the St.\r\nDenis Street tunnel.\r\n\r\nThe expropriation of the land necessary for the construction of\r\nPark Avenue tunnel is now going on and as soon as the proceedings\r\nare finished, means will be taken so that this tunnel be\r\nconstructed without delay.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        FILTRATION WORKS\r\n\r\nAt present in accordance with the endorsation of a scheme\r\npresented for the improved state of the city’s future water\r\nsupply there is being constructed a large filtration plant which\r\npromises Montreal the finest water supply on the continent.\r\n\r\nThe site of filtration plant will be mostly in the town of\r\nVerdun adjoining the low level pumping station, and will occupy\r\nan area of about eighty-five acres. After being conveyed to\r\nthe filtration pumping station the water will be lifted to\r\nthe prefilters, then flow by gravity to the final filters to\r\nthe filtered water reservoir, and will finally reach a new\r\nhydro-electric pumping station, and from there it will be pumped\r\nup to the reservoirs on Mount Royal and distributed through the\r\ncity.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: KEY MAP. SHOWING LOCATION OF FILTRATION WORKS At\r\npresent in accordance with the indorsement of a scheme presented\r\nfor the improved state of the city’s future water supply there is\r\nbeing constructed a large filtration plan which promises Montreal\r\nthe finest water supply on the continent.]\r\n\r\n\r\n                THE BOULEVARDS ALONG THE AQUEDUCT\r\n\r\nIncidentally the aqueduct is being broadened and a series of\r\nboulevards are being constructed on its banks. As this enterprise\r\nwas an outcome of the city planning movement, which has favorably\r\nmarked the last few years of civic improvement, it may be\r\nrecorded.\r\n\r\nOn the 26th May, 1913, the City Council adopted the following\r\nreport of the Board of Commissioners:--\r\n\r\n1. That the principle of establishing boulevards along the canal\r\nof the Aqueduct, according to the plans prepared by the City\r\nEngineers, be adopted by Council, a duplicate of these plans to\r\nbe deposited with the City Clerk.\r\n\r\n2. That the offers of ceding the land gratuitously for these\r\nboulevards be accepted on the following conditions:--\r\n\r\n(a) The work of planing and levelling the boulevards will be\r\ncarried on as the work on the canal progresses, the City shall\r\nnot be bound to open the proposed boulevards to traffic until the\r\nwork on the canal is completed.\r\n\r\n(b) The City shall, if possible, compel the contractors throwing\r\nup earth along the banks of the canal, to give the streets\r\nconnecting with the boulevards a grade of not more than 6% from\r\nthe line dividing the boulevards from the adjoining properties.\r\nProprietors adjoining the boulevards shall have the exclusive\r\nprivilege of having the material from the excavations deposited\r\non their land in the way they may determine, provided, however,\r\nsuch material is not needed by the City.\r\n\r\nThat all properties which will not have been ceded on the above\r\nmentioned conditions within a delay of three months from the\r\n1st of June, 1913, be expropriated according to the terms of\r\nthe law 3 Geo. V., Chap. 54, Section 20, and that the cost of\r\nsaid expropriation be borne exclusively by the proprietors of\r\nland bordering the proposed boulevards, according to a roll made\r\nand prepared according to the prescriptions of Art. 450 of the\r\nCharter of the City of Montreal.\r\n\r\nThat in case of there being any doubt of the power of the City\r\nto give effect to the above mentioned recommendation, the\r\nLegislation Committee and the City Attorneys be requested to\r\nobtain from the Legislature any legislation necessary for the\r\naccomplishment of this undertaking.\r\n\r\nThat the City obtain from the Legislature:\r\n\r\n1. Exemption from all taxes whether municipal, school, general\r\nor special which might be imposed upon the land forming part\r\nof the boulevards or of the Aqueduct and situated in other\r\nmunicipalities, without prejudice, however, to the rights of the\r\nTown of Verdun, in virtue of the Statute 1 Geo. V., 2nd Session,\r\nChap. 60, Section 2, concerning the commutation of taxes on\r\nimmovables owned by the City of Montreal in the Town of Verdun.\r\n\r\n2. Authorization to apply to all proprietors of lots fronting on\r\nthe proposed boulevards, the decrees of its Charter and of its\r\nBy-laws relating to building, sewers, sidewalks and pavements, as\r\nwell as by-laws relating to police and the maintenance of streets.\r\n\r\nThe opening of these boulevards is one of the greatest\r\nimprovements that Montreal has made for years, and once they are\r\ncompleted, our City will be in a position to compare favourably\r\nwith the most beautiful cities of America, in so far as its parks\r\nand boulevards are concerned.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           CONCLUSION\r\n\r\n               THE LAST PHASE OF CITY DEVELOPMENT\r\n\r\nIn order to preserve the continuity of the historical pictures of\r\nthe physical growth of this city from 1898 to 1914, the following\r\npicture summing up the confusing changes going on during the\r\ngreater part of the last two decades of commercial activity, may\r\nserve as a review.\r\n\r\nThe city is now undergoing a reconstruction and remodeling that\r\nis confusing even to its middle aged citizens, who were born in\r\nthe old humdrum city. Landmarks are disappearing; the buildings\r\nin the older part of the city and even parts of the new are\r\nbeing replaced with wondrous celerity, baffling the mind of\r\none not a statistician. It is the age of the house-wrecker and\r\nsteam-rivetter. Montreal is being modernized--becoming a second\r\nNew York--but in spite of all, manages to preserve its unique,\r\npsychological and historical characteristics. Commenting on the\r\nchanges, now undergoing in 1914, a writer in one of our daily\r\njournals (the Montreal Star of April 11, 1914, from which the\r\nfollowing is adopted) describes the present period as the era of\r\nthe house-wrecker and steam-welder.\r\n\r\nThis is a substantial description of the optimistic state of the\r\ncity shortly before the war of 1914.\r\n\r\n\r\n                 THE BOOM BEFORE THE WAR OF 1914\r\n\r\nThe dust of the house-wrecker, followed by the chatter of the\r\nsteam-rivetter marks more than the mere replacement of building\r\nby building, it marks the gradual alteration of the very face of\r\nthe city--and the house-wrecker and the steam-rivetter are abroad\r\nin the land six days in the week and fifty-two weeks in the year.\r\n\r\nThe truth of the matter is that plan and excavate and build as\r\nwe can, we cannot keep abreast of our requirements. What seems\r\nenormous to-day, fit to withstand the demands of the next half\r\ncentury, is almost to-morrow found inadequate. In New York they\r\nare tearing down buildings erected but a few years ago, of modern\r\nconstruction, and climbing up nineteen or twenty stories into\r\nthe air, because they do not pay, replacing them with the aid of\r\nnight and day shifts by buildings which shoot upwards for forty\r\nstories. In a lesser degree that is what is happening here.\r\n\r\nLet us take a few concrete instances of what has happened within\r\nthe memory of hundreds, if not of thousands, of Montrealers,\r\nusing St. James Street as an illustration.\r\n\r\nThe site of the new Bank of Commerce offices on St. James Street\r\ngives a good instance of the steady advance in the principal\r\ndown-town street of Montreal. Where the great stone pillars\r\nrear their bulk to-day, a church once stood, the St. James\r\nMethodist Church. A congregation, receding before the steady\r\nadvance of commerce, drove the church uptown, where the Allan\r\nprivate residence on St. Catherine and St. Alexander streets,\r\nwas purchased, and the down-town church went the way of all old\r\nbuildings. On its site rose the Temple Building, considered at\r\nthe time to be adequate to meet all needs for many years. This\r\nwas in the late ’80s, and the Temple Building lasted only till\r\n1909, when it, although it still served a useful purpose, made\r\nway for the huge building now on the site. Where the London,\r\nLancashire and Globe Building now stands, there stood a huddle of\r\nsmall shops and cottages built in the ’70s. These gave way to the\r\nBarron Block, which was a four-story brick affair, considered at\r\nthe time to be the last word in office architecture. The Barron\r\nBlock went up in flames eventually, but it was doomed anyway, and\r\nfor the same cause that spelled the end of the Temple Building\r\nacross and down the street; the space was needed. Freeman’s\r\nrestaurant, a name associated with Montreal for many years, also\r\nlocated at this spot, suffered demolition about the same time,\r\nbut sprung up again a few doors away.\r\n\r\nThe “Star” needed a permanent and adequate office on St. James\r\nStreet, and to make way for it a famous old commercial house\r\nstepped aside, J. and W. Hilton, furniture makers. A little\r\nlater and almost next door an even greater transformation was\r\ngoing on when the Dominion Express Building sprung into the\r\nair, shouldering the historic old St. Lawrence Hall back on\r\nto Craig Street. St. Lawrence Hall had for many years allowed\r\nthe C.P.R. a corner of its space on the ground floor, together\r\nwith a drug store of immemorial antiquity. Now, the ten-story\r\nDominion Express stands as a monument to what commerce and\r\nindustry demand. Across the street its bigger neighbour, the\r\nTransportation Building marks the spot where a three-story\r\nbuilding once sheltered Picken, the broker; the R. & O. and\r\nseveral other tenants. The new Bank of British North America, one\r\nof the finest bank buildings in Montreal, is another illustration\r\nof what is continually happening, the steady inroad of the big\r\nbuilding upon the small. Next to the present Transportation\r\nBuilding to the west stood at one time the Montreal Post Office,\r\nbefore the present one was erected; it too has undergone many\r\ninterior changes and exterior enlargements.\r\n\r\nThe Royal Trust Building has replaced the Imperial Insurance\r\nBuilding. The Credit Foncier Building stands where a ramshackle\r\ncollection of little buildings once stood on Little St. James\r\nStreet and St. Lambert’s Hill. The courthouse annex has succeeded\r\nSt. Gabriel Presbyterian church. During the last twenty years\r\nCraig Street has suffered less changes, the Montreal Light, Heat\r\nand Power Building, one of the biggest in its class in Canada,\r\nand the new Herald Building, being the only two outstanding\r\nstructures which have gone up.\r\n\r\nIn Victoria Square, the changes have been numerous, the Eastern\r\nTownships Bank Building replacing the original Morgan store,\r\nas perhaps the most notable. McGill Street has changed since\r\nthose disturbed days of flood when skiffs could be rowed across\r\nYouville Square. The McGill Building, the Shaughnessy Building,\r\nthe Dominion Express Building, and the huge head offices of the\r\nGrand Trunk have all grown up within the memory of young men, and\r\nthe completion of the new Customs House below Youville Square\r\nbids fair to transform the lower end of McGill Street completely.\r\n\r\nIt is, of course, impossible even to enumerate the buildings\r\nwhich have gone up north of Craig Street within the last two\r\ndecades. St. Alexander Street is a good illustration of what\r\nis happening from day to day. No less than three huge office\r\nbuildings have gone up on this short street in as many years, and\r\napparently the end is not yet.\r\n\r\nRip Van Winkle is reported to have found many changes after his\r\ntwenty year siesta. The Montrealer who has come to the years of\r\ndiscretion can share in Rip’s sensations of astonishment if he\r\nonly stops to think what is going on, methaphorically speaking,\r\nunder his nose. All he has to do is to imitate Rip, wake up,\r\nand realize that his city has changed during every one of the\r\nyears when he has been too busy to note. And, incidentally, he\r\nwill realize that these changes will become more instead of less\r\nfrequent, in the years to come.\r\n\r\nAnother account summarizing the changes occurring in 1913-1914 is\r\nas follows:\r\n\r\nOn St. James Street and Notre Dame there have cropped up in the\r\nbusiness section of La Sauvegarde, opposite the Court House,\r\nthe Lewis Building on St. Francis Xavier; the Versailles, on\r\nSt. James Street, near Place d’Armes; the Bank of British North\r\nAmerica Building; and the Reford Building on Hospital Street,\r\nthe latter a small four-story structure of unusually fine\r\nfinish. Other big downtown buildings are the Shaughnessy, on\r\nMcGill Street, and the McGill, at the corner of Notre Dame and\r\nMcGill streets--all but the one in the ten storey class, and all\r\ncompleted within the last year.\r\n\r\nThe present shows the great advance in growth of uptown\r\nstructures.\r\n\r\nThat big buildings soon will be common uptown has been shown by\r\nthe coming into being of three that have been erected almost\r\nsimultaneously,--the Drummond, at the corner of Peel and St.\r\nCatherine streets; the Guarantee Building on the Beaver Hall\r\nHill; and the Dandurand, the first ten storey building east\r\nof the Main Street and North of Craig, at the corner of St.\r\nCatherine Street and St. Denis Boulevard. Accommodation has been\r\nbooked heavily in all three, and already there are projects for\r\nmore to be erected in the course of the next year. The Scroggie\r\nBuilding, erected by the Peter Lyall Company, who have built most\r\nof the “big stuff” in Montreal, including the Transportation\r\nand Express on St. James Street, constitutes something of a\r\nrecord--ground was broken in December, 1912, and the place was\r\noccupied by November 1, 1913. The area covered by the structure\r\nis 127 feet by 345.\r\n\r\nAnother large structure, that has gone up quietly with little\r\ninterference with traffic and public convenience, is the\r\nten-storey addition to the Power Building on Craig Street--work\r\nwas begun in June and already the lower storeys are occupied\r\nby some of the office staff. One of the more remarkable of the\r\nnewer buildings is the Southam Press Building, the novel front of\r\nwhich attracts the eye of many a traveller in Bleury Street. Four\r\nstately female figures support the front, which is frescoed with\r\nsmall colored lizards and snakes.\r\n\r\nThe ground floor has an area of 4,525 square feet.\r\n\r\nThe new Montreal High School in University Street, which covers\r\nabout five acres of ground, and which has been in construction\r\nfor more than a year, will be vacated by the builders in about\r\ntwo months. The new Sun Life Building on Dominion Square, which,\r\nthe Company claims will have cost when finished upward of one\r\nand a quarter million dollars, has already been fitted with its\r\nskeleton of steelwork, and will be nearly completed by the end of\r\nthe summer. Another large building on which a great deal of work\r\nremains to be done is the new custom house building on McGill\r\nStreet, which will not be finished for two years, the object\r\nbeing to allow of the proper “seasoning” of the main structure,\r\nand the settling of the foundations. Considering the extent of\r\nbuilding operation in the city, there are comparatively few\r\naccidents, the death list being proportionately smaller than that\r\nof New York, where every skyscraper exacts its toll of several\r\ndeaths before completion.\r\n\r\nThe growth of the city of recent years has been so rapid and\r\ngreat that it can be best gauged about 1913 by the testimony of\r\na Montrealer, Mr. Donald McMaster, who had been absent for a few\r\nyears:\r\n\r\n“As I came up the river last night on the boat, I was astounded\r\nby what I saw in the way of industrial development in the East\r\nEnd of the city.\r\n\r\n“Belching chimneys, great mills and factories, the glow of\r\nfurnaces, the signs of an eager and aggressive industrialism. And\r\nthen today when I went westward and saw what was being done there\r\nin the way of expansion in the building up of the environs of the\r\ncity, in the multiplicity of machine and car shops, along the\r\nLachine canal, I said to myself that such growth surpassed that\r\nof London or Paris proportionately to population.\r\n\r\n“Why, you will have a million, not in a decade, but in a lustrum.\r\nYou don’t see all this growth as a stranger sees it. I am not\r\na stranger, of course; but I have been absent. I tell you I am\r\namazed at what I see, and proud of old Montreal.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: TYPES OF MODERN ARCHITECTURE IN MONTREAL]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Canadian Life Assurance

To take the naked figures\r\nof the census would be utterly misleading, for they do not\r\ninclude even the whole of the area within the city’s limits. That\r\nis to say, between the taking of the census and the publication\r\nof the results, Montreal had annexed a number of large towns\r\ncontiguous to it. But this is not the only respect in which\r\nthe relation of Montreal to the census is unique. It contains,\r\nwithin the city’s limits, or bounded by the city on more than\r\none side, but under distinct municipal government, three other\r\ncities--Westmount, Maisonneuve and Outremont It also possesses\r\nsuburbs, such as Lachine, which are merely manufacturing outposts\r\nof the city proper, and others, such as Longueuil, St. Lambert\r\nand Montreal West, which are in effect the city’s dormitories.\r\n\r\nIn figures given below, therefore, are included the population\r\nof these and other suburbs which are to all intents and purposes\r\npart of Montreal. They are part of the communal life, and the\r\nonly respect in which their people differ from those of Montreal\r\nis that they have distinct municipal administrations.\r\n\r\nIf we were to take the figures of the 1911 census, Montreal’s\r\npopulation would stand at 466,197, whereas the population of the\r\nmetropolitan community, as given by the census, is 590,919. Here\r\nare the figures in substantiation of this claim:\r\n\r\n  Montreal               466,197\r\n  St. Cunégonde           11,172\r\n  St. Henry               30,337\r\n  Westmount               14,327\r\n  Lachine                 10,778\r\n  Longueuil                4,016\r\n  St. Lambert              3,350\r\n  Montreal South             790\r\n  Montreal West              703\r\n  St. Laurent              3,502\r\n  Outremont                4,745\r\n  Cote des Neiges          2,447\r\n  Notre Dame de Grâce      5,217\r\n  Verdun                  11,627\r\n  Longue Pointe            3,037\r\n  Maisonneuve             18,674\r\n                         -------\r\n                         590,919\r\n\r\nNo one who knows the relation of these towns to Montreal will\r\ndeny the justice of grouping them as integral parts of this\r\ncommunity.\r\n\r\nIt must be remembered that these figures, first published a year\r\nago, are the result of a census taken in June, 1911. During\r\nthe decennial period 1900-1910, the city proper increased in\r\npopulation an average of 19,000 yearly. The increase during\r\nthe latter years of the period was much greater than at its\r\nbeginning, and it is a matter of common knowledge that it is the\r\nsuburbs which of late years have shown the fastest growth. From\r\nthese facts as a basis, it can be argued with every probability\r\nof accuracy that this community has grown since the census was\r\ntaken, by at least 35,000 people, making the total population at\r\nthis time not less than 625,000.\r\n\r\nOf the seventeen cities mentioned in the foregoing table Montreal\r\nstood sixteenth in 1900, Newark only being below her. Now,\r\nassuming that the population of Greater Montreal is 625,000, she\r\njumps to sixth place, taking rank above all except New York,\r\nChicago, Philadelphia, St. Louis and Boston. In justice to the\r\ncities she has passed in the race, it must be acknowledged\r\nthat they have doubtless also added to their population since\r\nthe census was taken, but it will hardly be claimed that the\r\nleader among them, Cleveland, has jumped from 560,663, its\r\ncensus standing, to the 625,000 of Montreal. If it be urged that\r\nperhaps some of the cities which Montreal has passed should also\r\nbe credited with the population of their suburbs, the answer\r\nis that neither Cleveland, Baltimore, Pittsburg, nor Detroit,\r\npossesses as many or as large suburbs as does Montreal. Boston is\r\na striking exception to this rule, and if the community of which\r\nit is the nucleus was included in computation, the result would\r\nprobably raise Boston to fourth place among the cities.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MONTREAL OF TO-DAY]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Royal Victoria Hospital]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Windsor Hotel]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Transportation Building, 1912]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Modern Montreal from the Mountain]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: McGill University Grounds]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The City Hall and Jacques Cartier Square]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Chateau de Ramsay, 1912; built in 1705]\r\n\r\n\r\n                                V\r\n\r\n                    MONTREAL AND WORLD CITIES\r\n\r\nBut there is still another interesting comparison to be made--how\r\ndoes Montreal stand among the cities of the world?

In 1901 she stood ninety-fifth in the same list.\r\nThis position, however, is not as conclusively Montreal’s due as\r\nis her rank in the table of North American cities, for the reason\r\nthat it is not possible to speak with exactitude regarding the\r\nactual size of the cities below Montreal when their suburbs are\r\nincluded. Manchester, so considered, is no doubt much larger.\r\nHowever, the position accorded the city cannot be far wrong, and\r\nthere is no gainsaying the fact that Montreal has grown in ten\r\nyears from the ninety-fifth place among the cities of the world\r\nto a place in the first thirty or forty.\r\n\r\nThere is good reason for believing that Montreal is now the\r\nlargest city in the self-governing Dominions of the Empire.\r\nOnly London, Glasgow, Liverpool and Manchester, in the British\r\nIsles, can claim to exceed her in population. If we exclude\r\nfrom the calculation the densely populated cities of the East,\r\nand Occidental cities, she will rank among the first twenty.\r\nAnd is there a city, among those which now surpass her in\r\npopulation, which is showing as large a percentage of growth? As\r\nthe metropolitan city of a virgin half-continent, towards which\r\nthe tide of immigration is yearly rushing with greater force,\r\nMontreal is growing with Canada’s growth, and every man who is\r\nconvinced of the tremendous development Canada will witness\r\nwithin the next decade must realize that this development will\r\nmean that Montreal must move, in that time, close to the million\r\nmark.\r\n\r\nIn 1901 Montreal had a population of 267,000. Her suburbs then\r\nwere small, but supposing we put them at 33,000, and call the\r\ngreater city 300,000. If today this greater city is 625,000 the\r\ngrowth in eleven years has been 325,000, or about 30,000 per\r\nyear. Is it unreasonable to assume that in nine years’ time we\r\nwill have a million souls on this island?\r\n\r\nThe following computation also will be interesting in later years\r\nas a specimen of current speculations and prophecies in 1914 of\r\nMontreal’s growth:\r\n\r\n“At this rate,” says a contemporary writer, “the city’s\r\npopulation will be considerably over the million mark in 1919.\r\nBy 1931, two years would be quite sufficient to add to the\r\npopulation of the spreading city, more people than are at present\r\nliving in both the city and suburbs. If the present rate of\r\nincrease should remain constant, twenty-six years from today\r\nwould see a city containing a greater population than the whole\r\nof the Dominion of Canada can boast of today, and with seven\r\nand three-quarter millions of people, exclusive of suburbs,\r\nconsiderably larger than the London of the present time. A trip\r\nfurther in the future is too dizzy for the brain of any but the\r\ntrained mathematician, but the array of figures are sufficient\r\nto show that within the life-time of the present citizens the\r\ncity on the shores of the St. Lawrence is likely to stand in the\r\nfore-front of the leading centers of the world. Of course, it is\r\nonly natural to expect that the increase will not be maintained\r\nat the present rate, but the addition of growing suburbs will\r\nlikely prevent any considerable decrease in the rate of advance.”\r\n\r\nBefore concluding these statistical pictures we may sum up the\r\nvital figures of the metropolis:\r\n\r\n\r\n                               VII\r\n\r\n                  THE

     A CITY PLAN FOR GREATER MONTREAL\r\n\r\nSeeing the future growth of the city, a movement was started\r\nin 1909 by the City Improvement League, an association of good\r\ncitizens, desirous of the best for their city. The report of its\r\nsecretary for 1912, states the progress of the city plan movement\r\nas follows:\r\n\r\nThe City Improvement League has, from its commencement,\r\nconsistently promoted the movement for a preconceived city plan\r\nto be adopted for the future expansion of Montreal. Its City\r\nPlanning Committee, backed by the cooperation of the great\r\ncommercial and philanthropic bodies of the city, has been\r\nrecognized as the exponent of the wishes of our best citizens,\r\nhaving already two years ago secured the appointment of a\r\nMetropolitan Parks Commission, whose duty it was to study the\r\nneeds of the city for such a plan.\r\n\r\nThis Commission, after a careful study, reported to the\r\nGovernment on January 5, 1911, on the very urgent necessity of\r\nthe city immediately undertaking some action in city planning,\r\nand it recommended the establishment of a permanent Metropolitan\r\nParks Commission, to carry on the work already initiated by the\r\npresent temporary use. The Commission presented a report drawn\r\nup for them by Mr. F.M. Olmstead, on subjects dealing with the\r\nselection of lands for parks and playgrounds, and with the\r\nlocation of boulevards and other main lines of urban and suburban\r\ntransportation, as necessary preliminaries in the formation of a\r\ncity plan for Montreal. In addition, the Commission presented a\r\ndraft bill for an act to establish a permanent Metropolitan Parks\r\nCommission.\r\n\r\nA bill based on the above draft was presented in March at the\r\nfollowing session of the Provincial Parliament, but was not\r\npassed, being held over for the next year. In the meantime, the\r\ntemporary Commission having presented its report, for which it\r\nwas appointed, automatically expired. The efforts of the League,\r\nto overcome the difficulties in the way of the bill, have since\r\noccupied a great part of the last year’s work.\r\n\r\nApart from meetings, and consultations of experts of a technical\r\nnature, every occasion was used to keep up public interest in the\r\ndemand for a permanent commission.\r\n\r\nIn October the Fourth General Assembly of the Royal Architectural\r\nSociety of Canada was held in Montreal, and on October 2d, at a\r\nspecial meeting of the delegates of this convention, and a large\r\nand representative gathering of citizens called together by the\r\nCity Improvement League, to discuss the town planning situation,\r\nthe following resolutions were carried:\r\n\r\n“That this assembly of the Royal Architectural Institute of\r\nCanada earnestly desires to urge upon the several Provincial\r\nGovernments, the necessity of providing without delay, parks and\r\nplaygrounds and housing commissions for each large city under\r\ntheir jurisdiction, especially with the object of preventing\r\nexcessive mortality, and making better provisions for the health,\r\ncomfort and recreation of the masses.\r\n\r\n“That the Government of the Province of Quebec is especially\r\nurged to appoint a permanent Metropolitan Parks Commission with\r\nexecutive powers.”\r\n\r\nIn December the Public Health Association of Canada called its\r\nfirst convention, it being held in Montreal. A very valuable\r\nsession on city planning, which was well attended by members of\r\nthe League, provided much stimulating thought to Canadian public\r\nhealth officers and city planners.\r\n\r\nA resolution to the following effect was proposed by Mr.\r\nH. Bragg, and seconded by Dr. Adami, president of the City\r\nImprovement League, viz., that this convention should recommend\r\nthat Provincial legislatures should create Park Commissions, to\r\nregulate the growth of towns and cities, and to control their\r\nhousing conditions, with powers of city planning and housing to\r\nextend even to suburban areas.\r\n\r\nThe matter was debated and finally left over to the Executive\r\nCommittee of the Canadian Public Health Association, which next\r\nday passed the following modified resolution:\r\n\r\nMoved by Doctor Bryce (Ottawa), and seconded by Doctor Sheriff\r\n(Ottawa), “that this association deems it worthy of urgent\r\nnecessity that Provincial legislatures pass Acts making provision\r\nwhereby urban municipalities can make house planning and land\r\npurchase schemes, whose operation may include suburban areas.”\r\n\r\nDuring the year public bodies interested in the bill renewed\r\ntheir resolutions in its favour. Thus, for instance, at the\r\nannual meeting of the Board of Trade, it was resolved on the\r\nmotion of Mr. R.W. Reford, seconded by Mr. Armand Chaput, “That\r\nthe Montreal Board of Trade, which since February, 1910, has\r\nadvocated the creation of a Metropolitan Parks Commission for the\r\nIsland of Montreal, now notes with gratification that the Quebec\r\nLegislature is considering the appointment of such a commission\r\nand the board, in annual general meeting assembled, hereby\r\nprays that Legislature to adopt, during the present Session,\r\nlegislation to that end.”\r\n\r\nThe above resolutions are quoted as indicative of the general\r\ntrend of expert thought, which has helped to form public opinion\r\nin the city, in favour of a Metropolitan Parks Commission.\r\n\r\nDuring the last two years every draft bill that has been drawn up\r\nfor the above movement has always had conjoined with it clauses\r\nof a “housing” aspect, since city planning and the comfort of\r\nthe working classes should never be separated. Consequently, the\r\nLeague has constantly promoted the study of city housing and\r\nadvocated schemes for garden cities and for model workingmen’s\r\ndwellings, side by side with those for more parks, playgrounds\r\nand open spaces, as desired by all town planners.\r\n\r\nThe following associations lent valuable cooperation: The Board\r\nof Trade and La Chambre de Commerce, The Canadian Manufacturers’\r\nAssociation, The Architects’ Association of the Province of\r\nQuebec, The Trades and Labor Council, The Parks and Playgrounds\r\nAssociation, The Citizens’ Association, The Canadian Club, The\r\nLocal Council of Women, The Montreal Women’s Club, The Fédération\r\nNationale, The Association St. Jean Baptiste, The Children’s Aid\r\nSociety.\r\n\r\nTo Mr. W.D. Lighthall, K.C., Convenor of the City Planning\r\nCommittee, and to its members, was due a large measure of the\r\nsuccess of the bill. Among these may be mentioned J. George\r\nAdami, M.D.; Sir William Van Horne, E.P. Lachapelle, M.D.;\r\nJ.L. Perron, K.C.; Hon. J.J. Guerin, M.D.; Controller Ainey,\r\nSir Alexander Lacoste, L.A. Lavallee, K.C.; J.I. Finnie, M.D.,\r\nM.L.A.; W.S. Maxwell, J.R. Gardiner, F.G. Todd, W. Rutherford,\r\nProf. J.A. Dale, J.V. Desaulniers, Farquhar Robertson, Olivar\r\nAsselin, Leslie H. Boyd, K.C.; William Lyall, the late Professor\r\nGregor, W. Johnson, H. Bragg, Dr. W.H. Atherton, secretary, and\r\nothers.\r\n\r\nLater an association entitled the Greater Montreal Housing and\r\nPlanning Association was formed to assist in carrying on the\r\nabove movement.\r\n\r\nThe plan movement has made uncertain progress, but still it is\r\nappreciable, especially as having overcome initial difficulties\r\nand in promoting preparatory measures and amelioration, leading\r\ntoward the desired goal.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[1] This expropriation caused the demolition of the old historic\r\nChapel of Notre Dame de Pitié. There were many who were grieved\r\nat this act of vandalism.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTranscriber’s note:\r\n\r\nFootnotes cited in tables were moved to the end of the table,\r\neven if the table spans multiple pages and the original footnote\r\nwas therefore in the middle of the table. All other footnotes\r\nwere moved to the end of their respective chapters.\r\n\r\nIllustrations in the original were presented on special plate\r\npages, followed by a blank facing page. The illustration pages\r\nwere numbered while the blank facing pages were not. These pages\r\nusually split a paragraph and sometimes even a word. Where they\r\nsplit a paragraph, they have been moved to follow the paragraph.\r\n\r\nTables too wide to display well on a screen have been divided\r\ninto multiple tables with repeated row labels. Lists displayed in\r\nmultiple columns simply to better use space now appear as single\r\nvertical column.\r\n\r\nThis work contains a very large number of deviations from\r\naccepted spellings, common diacritical markings, capitalization\r\nand punctuation rules, even for the period of the book. It is\r\nimpossible, in the majority of the cases, to determine which of\r\nthese deviations were desired by the author, which deviations\r\nreflect referenced or cited material, and which were printing\r\nerrors. They have therefore not been changed, with the exception\r\nof obvious punctuation printing errors, and the items below:\r\n\r\n35,00 changed to 35,000 on page 666.\r\n\r\n1911 changed to 1811 on page 127.\r\n\r\n926,34.46 changed to 92,634.46 on page 193.\r\n\r\n1910 changed to 1913 in the table heading on page 606.\r\n\r\nRepeated sentence removed from page 493. (As Montreal is a\r\nport of importance the sociological value of this movement is\r\napparent.)",
