A street ballad-singer, with a basket of ballads in slips, and\r\nsurrounded by her family of children, has thrown a wandering Hebrew\r\ninto a fit of pious ecstasy by the strains of her squalling voice,\r\nhelped out by the shrill accompaniments supplied by those of her\r\nchildren.\r\n\r\n_1800._ _Desire_, No. 7.

The old bachelor is also of a\r\nflinty aspect, his hands are clasped, thumbs pressed together, and head\r\nand eyes uplifted in pious abstraction and contemplation.\r\n\r\n_February 14, 1800._ _Beef à la Mode._ Published by R. Ackermann,\r\n101 Strand. Etched by Rowlandson (companion to _Collar'd Pork_).--A\r\nveritable bovine specimen, a fine Alderney, dressed out in the reigning\r\nmode. The fore part in female guise, on the head a gigantic hat of\r\nthe cart-wheel order, straw trimmed and garnished, huge ear-rings,\r\nthe extensive muslin 'choker,' a miniature of a bull round the cow's\r\nneck, ladies' buckled shoes, and ribboned sandles on the fore legs,\r\nand maccaroni's hessians and tassels on the hind ones; a lady's shawl\r\nthrown over the shoulders, according to the fashionable costume worn at\r\nthe end of the eighteenth century.\r\n\r\n_March 6, 1800._ _Dr. Botherum, the Mountebank._--From the bustle and\r\nlife visible on all sides it would seem that the period is fair-time,\r\nwhen the rustics and agricultural population of the vicinity in\r\ngeneral flock into the town, holiday-making. A travelling mountebank\r\nhas established his theatre in the market place; the person of the\r\ningenious charlatan is decked out in a fine court dress, with bag\r\nwig, powder, sword, and laced hat complete, the better to excite\r\nthe respect of his audience; he is holding forth on the marvellous\r\nproperties ascribed to the nostrums which he is seeking to palm off on\r\nthe simple villagers as wonder-working elixirs; while his attendants,\r\nMerry Andrew and Jack Pudding, are going through their share of the\r\nperformance. One branch of the mountebank physician's profession was\r\nthe drawing of teeth; an unfortunate sufferer is submitting himself to\r\nthe hands of the empiric's assistant. The rural audience is stolidly\r\ncontemplating the antics of the party, without being particularly\r\nmoved by Dr. Botherum's imposing eloquence, these vagabond scamps\r\nbeing frequently clever rogues, blessed with an inexhaustible fund\r\nof bewildering oratory, and witty repartee at glib command. Leaving\r\nthe quack, we find plentiful and suggestive materials to employ the\r\nhumourist's skilful graver scattered around. In the centre, a scene\r\nof jealousy is displayed; the beguilements of a portly butcher are\r\nprevailing against the assumed privileges of a slip-shod tailor, who is\r\nseemingly tempted to have recourse to his sheers, to cut the amorous\r\nentanglement summarily asunder. On the left, the promiscuous and greedy\r\nfeeding associated with 'fairings,' is going busily forward, and on the\r\nopposite side are exhibited all the drolleries which can be got out\r\nof a Jew pedlar, his pack, the diversified actions of customers he is\r\ntrying to tempt with his wares, and the bargains for finery into which\r\nthe fair and softer sex are vainly trying to beguile the cunning Hebrew\r\non their own accounts.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DR. BOTHERUM, THE MOUNTEBANK.]\r\n\r\nIt seems probable that Rowlandson in his print of _Doctor Botherum_\r\nmay have had a certain Doctor Bossy in his eye, a German practitioner\r\nof considerable skill, who enjoyed a comfortable private practice,\r\nsaid to have been the last of the respectable charlatans who exhibited\r\nin the British metropolis. This benevolent empiric, as Angelo informs\r\nus, dispensed medicines and practised the healing art, publicly and\r\ngratuitously on a stage, his booth being erected weekly in the midst\r\nof Covent-Garden Market, where the mountebank, handsomely dressed and\r\nwearing a gold-laced cocked hat, arrived in his chariot with a liveried\r\nservant behind.\r\n\r\nAccording to the old custom, the itinerant quack doctor, with his\r\nattendant gang, was as constant a visitor at every market-place as the\r\npedlar with his pack.\r\n\r\n_March 12, 1800._ _Humbugging, or Raising the Devil._ Published by\r\nR. Ackermann, 101 Strand.--A credulous personage, who, judging from\r\nhis costume, is in a fair position in life, has called to consult a\r\nnecromancer. The enchanter has a venerable beard, and a divining rod;\r\naccording to usage, he has made a circle of skulls, toads, and other\r\ninviting objects, in the centre of which, through a stage trap, he\r\nis raising the 'very deil,' and has conjured up a pantomimic demon,\r\nhorned, winged, and grotesquely arranged, holding in one hand a\r\ngore-stained dagger, and a goblet of suppositious blood in the other.\r\nThe knees of the befooled spectator are trembling beneath him; his\r\nback is turned to a curtain which conceals a fair enchantress, who is\r\nassisting the invocation, and giving a practical turn to the delusion\r\nby removing a well-filled pocket-book from the coat-tail of the simple\r\nvictim. In the background is the traditional whiskered cat, and the\r\nfolio of cabalistic signs; a stuffed crocodile is suspended from the\r\nroof.\r\n\r\n_March 12, 1800._ _Hocus Pocus, or Searching for the Philosopher's\r\nStone._ Rowlandson del. and sculp. Published by R. Ackermann, 101\r\nStrand.--Companion plate to 'Humbugging, or raising the Devil.' The\r\nartist introduces us to the laboratory of a so-called alchemist. A\r\nroguish Jew and his familiar are busily engaged in the transmutation of\r\nmetals; the servant, with a pair of long-nozzled bellows, is engaged\r\nin kindling the furnace, in which is a crucible; various retorts,\r\nalembics, and other paraphernalia of the 'black arts,' are scattered\r\nabout, as well as a formula for 'changing lead into gold;' although\r\nthe alchemists at best could only contrive to accomplish the reverse\r\ntransmutation. Suggestive prints are hung on the walls of this chamber\r\nof mystery, such as the portrait of the notorious 'Count Cagliostro,\r\ndiscoverer of the Philosopher's Stone,' and the figure of the spurious\r\n'Bottle Conjurer.'\r\n\r\nA military officer, in the next apartment, is turning his opportunities\r\nto more practical advantage by embracing, with a certain display of\r\nardour, a pretty maiden--who is nothing loth,--the daughter, it\r\nappears, of the philosophically minded investigator.\r\n\r\n_April 1, 1800._ _A Ghost in the Wine Cellar._ Published by T.\r\nRowlandson, 1 James's Street, Adelphi.\r\n\r\n_April, 1800._ _Caricature Medallions for Screens._ Published by R.\r\nAckermann, Strand.\r\n\r\n_April 20, 1800._ _Hearts for the year 1800._ Woodward inv., Rowlandson\r\nsculp.

Her\r\nold-maidish tastes are indicated by the nature of her pets; a monkey,\r\nseated in the embrasure of the window, is scratching his ear; he is\r\nsupported on the opposite side by a parrot, which is screaming with the\r\nfull force of its lungs.\r\n\r\n_June 26, 1800._ _A Sulky._ Companion Print to _A Silly_.

His fair companion, an elegant\r\nyoung damsel, is dressed in readiness to make her escape into more\r\nagreeable society; she is fuming with impatience, but dares not\r\nventure to move for fear of arousing the attention of her besotted\r\njailer. Her situation is more tantalising from the circumstance that\r\nthe maid-servant has brought in a billet-doux from a handsome youth,\r\nher admirer, who, all impatience, is looking over the shoulders of his\r\nmessenger.\r\n\r\n_July 25, 1800._ _Collar'd Pork._ Companion to _Beef à la Mode_ (see\r\np. 3).

The fashionable part of society\r\nhave, for once, found congenial allies in the wits. The papers which\r\ndoubtless obtained the most popular reception in their day, since\r\nthey laughed at the simple citizens 'on pleasure bent,' and held up\r\ntheir relaxations to a ridicule which was often neither subtle nor\r\npolished, were the essays in the _Spectator_, _Tatler_, _Guardian_,\r\n_Humourist_, _&c._, which made fun of the countrified loungings of\r\nthe Londoners. The squibs, in the shape of poetical broadsheets\r\nand songs of the Stuart era, against sylvan aspirations, were but\r\nre-echoed by the bright and cultivated humourists who flourished when\r\n'Anna ruled the realm.' Sturdy Hogarth, with his pictures, brought\r\nthe commonplace pleasures--although he was addicted to them with no\r\nhalf-spirit himself--of his neighbours into ludicrous prominence. The\r\n_Connoisseur_, _World_, _Mirror_, _Adventurer_, _Observer_, _Lounger_,\r\n_Looker-on_, and even Johnson's _Rambler_, are particularly caustic on\r\nthe comic side of humanity, as seen in their out-of-door pastimes. As\r\nto the days of transition, when the early Georgian generation was being\r\nrapidly submerged and effaced by the tide of progression, both writers\r\nand caricaturists combined to satirise cockney jauntings unmercifully.\r\nGillray, Rowlandson, Collings, Boyle, Bunbury, Deighton, Woodward,\r\nNixon, Newton, and a swarm of amateur followers, were always ready\r\nto make fun of suburban excursions; such productions were certain to\r\nobtain fame for the designers, and a ready patronage at the hands of a\r\npublic which encouraged similar everyday irony.\r\n\r\nIt seems, however, now the suburbs have disappeared, where tea-gardens\r\nwere once abundant--to which, armed with lanterns and in groups, for\r\nbetter security against the knights of the road, footpads, and similar\r\ndangers which were then rife, our forefathers repaired with light\r\nhearts, released from the culture of Mammon and money-grubbing--that\r\nwe have lost a great deal which modern improvements are powerless to\r\nrestore.\r\n\r\nA little generation back there were still relics of past pleasure\r\nhaunts, a Sluice House, a Hornsey Wood House, and numberless similar\r\nresorts for the dwellers in Babylon, who sighed to turn, for a brief\r\nafternoon of diversion, their respectable backs on groves of brick,\r\nand to regale their pastoral-longing eyes with a semblance of the\r\ncountry. Now the monster metropolis, with unsparing strides, has\r\nfinally absorbed such patches of verdure, as made homely retreats on\r\nred-letter holidays; and life is considerably restricted, as regards\r\nthe variety which an hour's jaunt could introduce into the prosaic\r\ncurrent of yearly existence, as far as the boundaries of the giant city\r\nare concerned.\r\n\r\nA great deal could be written on the defunct pleasure-gardens which\r\nonce enlivened the outskirts; but their glories are departed, or\r\nat best preserved in the satires, literary and artistic, which\r\ncontemporary humourists levelled at the Georgic-loving citizens who\r\nfrequented them. Such a suburban retreat, with the motley crowds\r\nwho disported themselves thereat, is graphically reproduced in\r\nRowlandson's plate of _Summer Amusement_. Much of the delight was\r\nprosaic and toilsome; but, seemingly, good fun was to be had, and\r\npeople could lay aside their conventional rigidity for once and\r\nawhile, when fine weather and the pleasant season tempted them to\r\nstray, and leave the everlasting counting-house at home, for a game\r\nat bowls and a little wholesome relaxation. The various groups found\r\nin the picture are well conceived. Two games are proceeding, into\r\nwhich cits, of various degrees, are throwing their entire energies.\r\nThe whimsical accompaniments connected with 'taking tea in the arbour'\r\nare faithfully seized. The soberer elders are crowding the hospitable\r\n'house of call.' Round the foremost table is gathered a convivial\r\nparty; the worthy souls are draining a parting bowl, before commencing\r\ntheir return journey, for which the lantern is set on the ground in\r\nprudent preparation. A little toasting is going on at the next table,\r\nand beyond that an arcadian flirtation is in progress, with various\r\nincidents transpiring around, such as the observant philosopher might\r\nhave noted in 1800, without travelling very far out of his way.\r\n\r\n_August 30, 1800._ _Gratification of the Senses à la mode\r\nFrançaise._--(Seeing, Tasting, Hearing, Smelling, Feeling.)\r\n\r\n_October 1._ _The Newspaper._ G.

The plate is delicately etched.\r\nYorick is seated beside the pretty milliner; the complaisant husband\r\nis bowing, grimacing, and attitudinising. A poodle is on a settee. Two\r\nblocks, hat and cap moulds, are, with bandboxes, robes, &c., scattered\r\naround. Outside is seen a glimpse of the quaint antiquated French\r\nstreet life, such as might be encountered by the sentimental traveller\r\nbefore the Revolution:--priests, monks, portresses, &c., with images of\r\nsaints at the street corners.\r\n\r\nOn August 15, 1800, Mr. Ackermann issued at his Repository of\r\nArts, 101 Strand, a series of six plates designed and etched in\r\nRowlandson's boldest and most spirited style; and finished and\r\ncoloured in almost exact imitation of the original drawings. Each\r\nplate contains three large distinct heads, festooned with attributes\r\npeculiar to the respective designs. It is not very clear whether\r\nthese symbolical groupings, which are superior in execution to the\r\naverage of Rowlandson's published works, were devised to be cut up\r\nfor scrap-books, screens, or wall borderings; but they have become\r\nremarkably scarce since the date of publication, and sets of these\r\ntypical heads (eighteen in all) are rarely met with at the present date.\r\n\r\n_Philosophorum._--The head of the philosopher closely resembles the\r\nconventional portrait accorded to Father Time, horn spectacles,\r\nforelock, grey beard and all. The globe, a sextant, mariner's compass,\r\nchart, telescope, dividers, bells, squares, thermometers, &c., make up\r\nthe symbolical garland which depends from the ears of this emblem of\r\nknowledge.\r\n\r\n_Fancynina._--This figure is borne out by one of the artist's\r\nfavourite types of female beauty, a well-featured, handsomely made and\r\nlanguishing-looking young lady, wearing a modish hat, all feathered,\r\nbeaded, and flowered. The portrait of _Fancynina_ is festooned\r\nwith such emblems of feminine frivolity as French rouge, Court\r\nsticking-plaister (for patches), ottar of roses, watches and trinkets,\r\nminiatures of admirers, an opera glass, a black domino or half-mask, a\r\nhuge muff, parasol, fan, &c.\r\n\r\n_Epicurum._--An old gourmand in a red nightcap, whose flushed and\r\nblossoming countenance appears through a goodly string of sausages;\r\na gridiron, a basting ladle, a cucumber, and other indications of\r\ncreature comforts complete the emblems of this figure.\r\n\r\n_Penserosa._--The head of a tragic performer, modelled on that of\r\none of the Gorgones is used to illustrate this figure. The Medusa\r\nhead is entwined with serpents, and wreathed below with a festoon of\r\nbays, beneath which hang the dagger and bowl, and the manuscript of\r\n_Penserosa's_ tragic part.\r\n\r\n_Tally ho! rum!_--The head of a Nimrod, backed with a huntsman's cap,\r\nis the sign-piece of this figure; a _corne de chasse_ is hung round\r\nthe sportsman's neck, and on it are spurs, horseshoes, whips, a gun,\r\npowder-flask, and game bag; a fox's head completes the group of emblems\r\ndistinctive of _Tally ho! rum!_\r\n\r\n_Allegoria._--The head of a rubicund, but young and well-featured,\r\nBacchus does duty for _Allegoria_; heavy clusters of vine-leaves, and\r\nbunches of purple grapes and tendrils crown and surround the bucolic\r\ndivinity; below is a Silenus mask; bacchanalian flutes, and pipes of\r\nPan, complete the insignia.\r\n\r\n_Physicorum._--The face of a lean, high-dried, and sharp-featured\r\ndoctor, with a high, white wig, and a profusion of horsehair curls,\r\nfigures forth _Physicorum_ with proper character; festoons of bottles\r\nof medicine, soporific, strengthening, emollient, purging and\r\nsleeping draughts in all varieties, boxes of pills, ointments, drops,\r\nprescriptive puffs, quackeries, and the inevitable syringe and clyster\r\npipe, make up the attributes of the physician.\r\n\r\n_Nunina._--The head of a rosy-cheeked and buxom Nun, her eyes devoutly\r\nraised to realms above. Beneath the portrait the crowned and ghastly\r\nskull of King Death, a book of devotions, a _flagellum_ for discipline,\r\na crucifix, hour-glass and rosary, and other pious symbols are\r\ndisplayed.\r\n\r\n_Publicorum._--The face of a fat and rubicund-visaged landlord does\r\nduty as the emblem of _Publicorum_; as may be supposed, the symbols of\r\nthis personage consist mainly of convivial attributes--tobacco-boxes,\r\npipes, bottles of rum, brandy, and rack; a tankard, limes, lemons, a\r\npunchbowl, ladle, &c.\r\n\r\n_Funeralorum._--The head of a professional mourner, with long\r\ncrape streamers round his hat, and a mourning cloak. _Funeralorum_\r\nis surrounded by such cheerful attributes as funeral sermons,\r\nadvertisements of interments, and invitations to the same, burial fees,\r\ntitles, last wills and testaments, hatchments, Yorick's skull, an\r\nhour-glass, and a sexton's pick and spade.\r\n\r\n_Virginia._--The head of a soured and malignant-looking old maid,\r\nwhose favourite parrot is screaming in her ear. The vixenish face is\r\nfestooned with suppositious attributes of old spinsterhood--a group\r\nof boxes of snuff, corn-plaisters, padlocks, pincushions, cats-meat,\r\nanonymous letters, drops for the colic; while a bag for 'winnings at\r\n_quadrille_' is displayed on the _Scandalous Magazine_, beside which\r\nare perched two spitting and caterwauling old tom-cats.\r\n\r\n_Hazardorum._--The head given as representative of _Hazardorum_ wears\r\na very disconsolate and downcast look; fortune has not favoured the\r\ngambler, as is figuratively evinced by a purse turned upside down, from\r\nwhich the contents are escaping, mortgage-deeds, annuity bonds, _Hoyle\r\non Chances_, a betting book, a game cock, rackets, dice and a dice-box.\r\n_The Racing Calendar_, playing cards, billiard cues, a loaded pistol,\r\nand other suggestive emblems supply the features of _Hazardorum_.\r\n\r\n_Battlcorum._--The head of a fierce-looking warrior, with plumed hat,\r\nsets forth _Battlcorum_; warlike attributes surround the stern hero,\r\nwhose face is grim as war itself. Chain-shot, pistols, shot-belts, a\r\ncartouche box, bayonet, sword, gun, drum. &c., help out the martial\r\nfigure and assist its due signification.\r\n\r\n_Billingsgatina_ displays the face of a buxom young fish-girl,\r\ntopped with a sailor's straw hat, and surrounded by evidences\r\nof her fishy profession: strings of eels, lobsters, crabs, cod,\r\noysters, and fish-baskets are introduced to support the character of\r\n_Billingsgatina_.\r\n\r\n_Trafficorum_ is represented by a long-haired, hook-nosed, shrewd-eyed\r\nJew pedlar, wearing an unkempt beard; round his neck hangs the\r\nsuggestive hawker's box, with the multifarious contents of the pack\r\ndisplayed; scissors, tape, ribands, spectacles, purses, razors, combs,\r\nknives, forks and spoons, watches, trinkets, necklaces, ear-rings,\r\nbuckles, and an infinity of similar articles, disclose the identity of\r\n_Trafficorum_.\r\n\r\n_Barberorum._--The head of a French hair-dresser does duty for this\r\nfigure; a comb is stuck in the lengthy locks, and a white apron is\r\npinned under the shaven chin. Implements properly pertaining to the\r\nbarber's calling are introduced to form a trophy; a string of wigs of\r\nall colours and shapes, a block, powder-bags, curling-irons, tongs,\r\ncombs, scissors, tooth brushes, razors and Packwood's strops, flasks\r\nof scent, eau de Luce, lotions, boxes of pommades, rouge, &c., furnish\r\nforth emblemata of the hair-dressing _Barberorum_.\r\n\r\n_Flora_ is represented by a sweetly innocent flower-seller, whose soft\r\nand winning face appears above clusters of roses, lilies, tulips,\r\nbluebells, and other flowers, while beneath the attributes of _Flora_\r\nare completed by a basket of fruits and vegetables.\r\n\r\n_Lawyerorum_ very significantly closes the series of emblematical\r\nheads. The counsel is a hard-featured, sharp, close, shrewd, and\r\nlong-headed looking individual, attired in his horsehair wig, and\r\nfestooned around with the sweets of his profession--_Affidavits_,\r\n_Subpoenæ_, _Perjuries_, _Bankrupts enlarged_, '_Wills made on the\r\nshortest notice_,' _Writs of Error_, _Clausum Friget_, _Bills of\r\nCosts_, _Declarations_, _Actions between John Doe and Richard Roe_,\r\n_Warrants for assaults_, _Habeas Corpus_, _Suits in Chancery_, _Lists\r\nof Informations_, _Quirks_, _Quibbles_, _Briefs_, _Title-deeds_,\r\n_Statutes at large_, bags of _causes_, ponderous legal volumes; the\r\nemblemata are significantly supported by a well-filled brief bag,\r\nplethoric with 'cash received on clients' accounts, not paid over.'\r\n\r\n1800. _A Peep into Bethlehem._\r\n\r\n    Ah! then dismounted from his spavin'd hack,\r\n    To Bethlehem's walls, with Burke, I saw him borne,\r\n    There the straight waistcoat close embrac'd his back:\r\n    While Peggy's wreath of straw did either brow adorn,\r\n    And there they sit, two grinners, _vis-a-vis_;\r\n    He writing Grub Street verse, Burke ranting rhapsody.\r\n        _Vide Melancholy Catastrophe_, _by_ PETER FIG, Esq.\r\n\r\nThe bard Peter Pindar is leaning his elbows on a sheet of verses lately\r\ncommenced, 'An Ode to Paine,' his poems the 'Lousiad,' 'Pension,' 'Ode\r\nupon Ode,' &c., are scattered on the ground. Burke, with a shaven\r\nhead, and wearing a rosary round his neck, is declaiming impassioned\r\neloquence, while his foot is trampling upon two volumes, the 'Rights of\r\nMan,' and 'Common Sense,' with Peter Pindar's 'Ode upon Ode.'\r\n\r\n1800 (?). _Country Characters.

The publican is drinking in true old-fashioned\r\nlandlordlike style with the squire, a Tony Lumkin of a landed\r\nproprietor; mine host wears a red nightcap, and clean white sleeves,\r\napron, and stockings. Tony Lumkin has been trying to palm off an old\r\nstory on his friend, but the landlord's experience is too much for him.\r\n'Come, squire,' he cries, 'that won't do; that's Joe Miller, I'm sure,\r\npage 490.'\r\n\r\n_Country Characters.

'They\r\nwrite from Amsterdam,' reads the preoccupied barber; while the\r\ngentleman in the seat of torture, writhing with pain and apprehension,\r\nvehemently shouts: 'Halloh! you sir,--what, are you going to cut my\r\nnose off?'\r\n\r\nThe remainder of the series does not require a more particular\r\ndescription.\r\n\r\n1800 (?). _Country Characters.

The head\r\nof the house is an ill-favoured person, of advanced age and wearing\r\na tremendous wig. Before him is a leg of mutton, and, knife and fork\r\nin hand, he is considering the joint with the eye of disfavour. 'It's\r\nred!' he grumbles, 'not fit to eat!--these are the blessed effects\r\nof boiling mutton in a cloth!' His wife is regarding the dinner with\r\nconsternation; one son is opening his eyes, and 'making a mouth'\r\napprehensive of losing his dinner; another youth bears a look of\r\nabsolute dejection; the family circle is completed by the addition of a\r\nqueer poodle, seated on his hind legs, and wearing a disappointed look,\r\nlike the rest of the diners. An appropriate pair of figures, _Peace_\r\nand _Concord_, are hung on the wall by way of pictures.\r\n\r\n1800. _Matrimonial Comforts._ No. 2, _Late Hours_. Woodward del. Etched\r\nby Rowlandson.

Ackermann, 101 Strand.--A\r\nvenerable and somewhat decrepit spouse has been for a 'constitutional.'\r\nOn his return he is gratified with the discovery of a very interesting\r\ndomestic tableau: his young and pretty wife is fast asleep on the\r\nknee of a dashing officer, who, seated on the family sofa, is also\r\nslumbering blissfully, with one arm round the waist of the faithless\r\nwife, while his hand is clasping that of the lady, one of whose arms\r\ntenderly encircles the neck of her martial admirer. The rash intruder\r\non this scene, with good reason, is much shocked at the situation, and\r\nis exclaiming in dismay, 'My wife! as sure as I am a haberdasher.'\r\n\r\n1800. _Matrimonial Comforts._ No. 5, _Killing with Kindness_. Woodward\r\ndel. Etched by Rowlandson. Published by R. Ackermann, 101 Strand.--The\r\nvictim to ill-directed matrimonial attentions is a stout countrified\r\nold gentleman; he is seated in his arm-chair, very much at the mercy\r\nof two fair and youthful tormentors, whose exertions on his behalf\r\nare probably _not_ disinterested. The wife, a very stylish damsel,\r\nseemingly young enough to be the daughter of her embarrassed spouse, is\r\nleaning on his chair and pressing him to partake of a dish of fruit,\r\nand insisting, 'You must have some apricots, my love!' while her\r\nsister, patting the husband affectionately on the shoulder, is forcing\r\na bunch of grapes into his mouth, which he has incautiously opened, to\r\nexpress his dissent: 'Just take these grapes, brother-in-law, you never\r\neat finer!' The old gentleman, who shrewdly values this devotion at its\r\nworth, is crying: 'I wo'nt eat anything more, I tell you--I shall be\r\nchoked--got an eye to the estate, I suppose!'\r\n\r\n1800. _Matrimonial Comforts._ No. 6, _A Fashionable Suit_. Woodward\r\ndel. Etched by Rowlandson. Published by R.

The victim\r\nis contemplating his uncomfortable suit in a looking-glass held by\r\nthe tailor, who is dismayed at the indignant protest of his client:\r\n'Why, you have put me a hump upon each shoulder, and here's a pair of\r\nDutchman's breeches that would hold provision for a marching regiment;\r\nwell, I tell you what, Master Tailor, d---- me if I would go to our\r\nclub such a figure for fifty pounds!' The snip is assuring him in\r\nreply: 'Made entirely to your lady's orders, your Honour, I assure\r\nyou she said now you was married you should look like the rest of the\r\nworld.'\r\n\r\n1800. _Matrimonial Comforts._ No. 7, _Washing Day_.

The clock points to 'five\r\no'clock in the morning,' and the husband, night-cap on head, and his\r\nface bearing an expression of injured martyrdom, has clasped his hands\r\nin despair of obtaining rest from the energetic denunciations of his\r\nwife, who, leaning over him in a commanding attitude, is pouring forth\r\nher 'Caudle-like' remonstrances over the prostrate sufferer: 'Yes, you\r\nbase man, you; don't you eat, drink, and sleep comfortably at home? and\r\nstill you must be jaunting abroad every night. I'll find out all your\r\nintrigues, you may depend on it.'\r\n\r\n1800 (?). _Preparation for the Academy, Old Joseph Nollekens and\r\nhis Venus._--John Thomas Smith, many years Keeper of the prints and\r\ndrawings in the British Museum, and better known by his works on\r\nmetropolitan antiquities, to which he furnished etchings, as well as\r\narchæological researches, has left us one of the chattiest and most\r\neccentric biographies to be found in the annals of literature--the\r\n_Life of the Sculptor Nollekens_, whose pupil he was. Much as we are\r\nindebted to 'Antiquity Smith' for the whimsical anecdotes he has\r\nimported into his unequivocally entertaining pair of volumes, which\r\ntouch freely upon contemporary men and things under their most familiar\r\nand every-day aspect, we cannot fail to feel a passing regret that\r\nthe versatile keeper has forgotten to make any anecdotal mention of\r\nhis friend Rowlandson, with whom he was on terms of cordiality. The\r\ncaricaturist had presented, at times, some of his most interesting\r\ndrawings to 'his old friend John Thomas Smith,' as he has taken care\r\nto inscribe on the margins, with his autograph; the best of these\r\nis possibly, _Drawing from the Life-School at the Royal Academy_--a\r\nsubject upon which both the humourists were well informed, since they\r\nhad worked there as students, and were more or less acquainted with\r\nall the artists of the day, and, moreover, it being impossible to\r\noverlook such points, with their keen sense of the eccentric; they had\r\nnoted--the one with his pencil, and the other with his pen--all the\r\nstriking peculiarities, personal or professional, of their numerous\r\nassociates. The latest portrait the present writer has seen of our\r\nartist is one drawn with a pen in outline and tinted with Indian ink\r\nby the worthy keeper, one day when the caricaturist was visiting the\r\nPrint Room of the British Museum, Rowlandson being, at that time, well\r\nadvanced in years. The sketch is that of a large and decisive-looking\r\nelderly gentleman, with a bald head, firmly-cut features, and wearing\r\nbig old-fashioned spectacles; this portrait was taken while the subject\r\nwas stooping to examine a drawing. Beneath it John Thomas Smith has\r\ninscribed the particulars under which he came to draw the portrait of\r\n'his old friend.'\r\n\r\nThe grave omission with which we have to charge Nollekens' biographer,\r\nusually so amazingly fertile in individualistic traits of everyone he\r\nknew--and he seems to have been fairly acquainted with, or to have\r\nsomething amusing to impart about, nearly everybody of any note--in\r\nrespect to the caricaturist, of whom his writings make no sort of\r\nmention, is the more to be regretted, since it was probably a sly hint\r\nimparted by 'Antiquity Smith' which produced the picture of the gifted\r\nold miser at work on one of his cherished subjects--a whimsical study,\r\ndoubtless founded on a special visit of observation, instituted, with\r\nNollekens' old pupil, for the very purpose. As regards the sculptor's\r\nportrait, which is seemingly caricatured, John Thomas Smith comes in\r\nas aptly with his description[1] as if the two sittings had taken\r\nplace simultaneously, and the biographer and artist had worked _en\r\ncollaboration_:--'His figure was short, his head big, and it appeared\r\nmuch increased by a large-crowned hat, of which he was very fond. His\r\nneck was short, his shoulders narrow, his body too large, particularly\r\nin the front lower part; he was bow-legged and hook-nosed; indeed,\r\nhis leg was somewhat like his nose, which resembled the rudder of an\r\nAntwerp packet-boat; his lips were rather thin, but between his brows\r\nthere was great evidence of study.'\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PREPARATIONS FOR THE ACADEMY. OLD JOSEPH NOLLEKENS AND\r\nHIS VENUS.]\r\n\r\nAs to 'his Venuses' Mrs. Nollekens invariably continued to express\r\nthe most derogatory opinions, since she regarded his fair models\r\nas 'abandoned huzzies, with whom she had no patience,' regarding\r\nher eccentric spouse as quite on their level, for she cherished the\r\nextraordinary conviction that after his marriage he ought to have\r\n'dispensed with such people.' While Mrs. Nollekens was unduly mindful\r\nof her husband's favourite models, it seems these ladies, under altered\r\ncircumstances, occasionally amused themselves by reminding the sculptor\r\nof their former acquaintance, on which pleasant fact his biographer\r\ndoes not fail to enlarge, in more than one instance:--\r\n\r\n'Our sculptor would sometimes amuse himself, on a summer's evening,\r\nby standing with his arms behind him at the yard-gate, which opened\r\ninto Titchfield Street. During one of these indulgences, as a lady was\r\npassing, most elegantly dressed, attended by a strapping footman in\r\nsilver-laced livery, with a tall gilt-headed cane, she nodded to him,\r\nand, smiling, asked him if he did not know her. On his reply that he\r\ndid not recollect her, \"What, sir!\" exclaimed she, \"do you forget Miss\r\nColeman, who brought a letter to you from Charles Townley, to compare\r\nlimbs with your Venus? Why, I have been with you twenty times in that\r\nlittle room, to stand for your Venus.\" \"Oh! _lawk-a-daisy_, so you\r\nhave!\" answered Nollekens. \"Why, what a fine woman you're grown! Come,\r\nwalk in, and I'll show you your figure--I have done it in marble.\"\r\nAfter desiring the man to stop at the gate she went in with him; and\r\nupon seeing Mrs. Nollekens at the parlour-window, who was pretending\r\nto talk to and feed her sister's bullfinch, but who had been informed\r\nby the vigilant Bronze (the eccentric maid-servant of this odd pair)\r\nof what had been going on at the gate, she went up to her and said,\r\n\"Madam, I have to thank----.\" Mrs. Nollekens then elevated herself on\r\nher toes, and, with a lisping palpitation, began to address the lady.\r\n\"Oh, dear,\" observed Miss Coleman, \"and you don't know me! You have\r\ngiven me many a basin of broth in the depth of winter, when I used\r\nto stand for Venus.\" Mrs. Nollekens, not knowing what to think of\r\nJoseph, shook her head at him as she slammed the window, at the same\r\ntime exclaiming, \"Oh, fie! Mr. Nollekens! Fie! fie!\" Bronze assured me\r\nthat when her master went into the front parlour he had a pretty warm\r\nreception. \"What!\" said her mistress, \"to know such wretches after you\r\nhave done with them in your studio!\"'\r\n\r\nIn Rowlandson's picture the sculptor is actually at work on a Venus and\r\nCupid; one of his most successful models.[2]\r\n\r\n1800. _Rainbow Tavern, in Fleet Street, in 1800._\r\n\r\n1800. _Remarks on a Tour to North and South Wales in the year 1797_,\r\nby Henry Wigstead, with plates from Rowlandson, Pugh, Howitt, &c.\r\n(Aquatinted by J.

Flesh is scarce\r\never tasted by them; and, except when visitors leave behind remnants of\r\nwine, ale, &c., milk is the principal beverage that passes their lips.\r\nThey are remarkably observant of any decorations worn by ladies, such\r\nas beads, laces, and feathers, which strengthened my opinion of their\r\nsimilitude with the Otaheiteans, &c.

The national Irish saint, whose beard gives him the expression\r\nof a Jew, is crying, ''Pon my conscience I don't know what you call it,\r\nbut the deuce of anything like a Union do I see, except their horns\r\nbeing fastened together.'

His face expresses a profoundly\r\nbaffled emotion, which is portrayed with a masterly hand. He is musing,\r\nin abject despair, over a chance lost, a bargain missed, a gain which\r\nhas slipped through his prehensile fingers. Some Antonio of our modern\r\nVenice founded on the shores of the Thames has escaped his toils; some\r\npoint of law, a flaw in the indentures, mayhap, has been turned to\r\naccount by a later 'Daniel come to judgment--a wise young judge,' to\r\nwhom the disconcerted Hebrew is finally loth to offer his gratitude.

Ackermann, 101 Strand.--We are not prepared with any special\r\nparticulars as to the foundation of this convivial club; but we\r\nmay record a solitary gratuitous observation, that in spite of the\r\nmelancholy and frequent carpings, on puritanical grounds, which are\r\nnow in fashion, over the growing degeneracy of the times in which we\r\nlive--the sanctimonious being given to assert that each succeeding\r\ngeneration inveterately surpasses the excesses of its predecessors--in\r\nthe instances of drinking and gaming our ancestors went to extremes\r\nbeside which our modern dissipations, in their wildest excesses, fall\r\ninto paltry insignificance. The clubs of the past, in the item of\r\niniquity, although the institution was in its infancy, surpassed those\r\nof the present day in such a degree that our 'fastest' haunts appear\r\nprudish by comparison.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE BRILLIANTS.]\r\n\r\nAs to _The Brilliants_, we do not accept the scene, in its literal\r\nsense, as a faithful transcript of current amusements as practised at\r\nthe commencement of the century; but, allowing for the exaggeration\r\nof burlesque, we are far from denying that it is founded on actual\r\nobservation, in an age notoriously given to conviviality, which was\r\ncarried, in all phases of society, beyond the bounds of discretion,\r\nand, in some instances, to a decree incredible in our times. Their\r\nRoyal Highnesses the Princes of the Blood, their Graces the Dukes,\r\nthe proverbially drunken Lords, the Right Honourable Ministers of\r\nState, Honourable Members of every political shade, and gallant and\r\nlearned gentlemen of the various services and professions, were, with\r\nthe rest of the community, without mentioning notorious and personal\r\ninstances, under no restraint of decorum in regard to inebriety; and,\r\nif we may trust their own chroniclers, exhibited themselves without\r\nreserve as frequently drunk as sober. If, in our charitable concessions\r\nto the failings of our ancestors, we assume that our artist has\r\nexercised undue licence in the representation of their failings, from\r\nthe president of _The Brilliants_ downwards, we must further take 'a\r\ngrain of salt' to qualify our belief in the fidelity with which he has\r\ntransmitted us the 'club rules.' It is impossible that any convivialist\r\ncould continue to be 'brilliant' after his senses were diluted by the\r\namount of fluid prescribed as a qualification for membership; the light\r\nthat was in him must be effectally extinguished by the vinous drenching\r\nthat was _de rigueur_:--\r\n\r\n                'RULES TO BE OBSERVED IN THIS SOCIETY.\r\n\r\n    '1st. That each member shall fill a half-pint bumper to the first\r\n    toast.\r\n    '2nd. That after twenty-four bumper toasts are gone round every\r\n    member may fill as he pleases.\r\n    '3rd. That any member refusing to comply with the above regulations\r\n    to be fined, _i.e._ compelled to swallow a bumper of salt and\r\n    water.'\r\n\r\n_January 15, 1801._ _Undertakers Regaling._ John Nixon, Esq., del.,\r\nRowlandson sculp. Published by R. Ackermann, 101 Strand.--This large\r\nplate, which is designed with a due appreciation of grim humour and\r\ntipsy jocularity, introduces the traditional relaxations of the funeral\r\nfurnishers, whose jollifications are supposed to offer the most ghastly\r\ncontrast to their sober professional duties. On a convenient plot of\r\ngrass mutes, wandsmen, hearse-drivers, and all the other melancholy\r\nfunctionaries of the last rites of unconscious humanity, are picnicking\r\nwith a true zest and appreciation of rural freedom. A substantial\r\npie, and other suggestive 'funeral baked meats,' are being disposed\r\nof to the best advantage; but, excellent trenchermen though the\r\nundertakers may prove themselves, their main distinction must rest on\r\ntheir bibulous qualities; the members of the fraternity are applying\r\nthemselves with hearty goodwill to the fluids, far on the road to\r\nbecoming 'glorious,' while some of the party have already reached their\r\ncongenial stage 'of half seas over.' These festivities, of course, take\r\nplace in the vicinity of a 'house of call for funerals,' at the sign\r\nof 'The Owl,' in the neighbourhood of a burial-ground, the hospitable\r\nhostelry being kept by 'Robert Death,' whose inn is a resting-place\r\nfor all returning hearses on that particular road. Groups of gentlemen\r\nengaged in the 'black business' are seated at tables, enjoying their\r\nlong clay pipes, or otherwise diverting themselves with romping and\r\nhorse-play; the members of another party, preparing to resume their\r\nroute back to the metropolis, are on the roof of their hearse, their\r\nlegs hanging over the side with pastoral-like simplicity, smoking their\r\n'church-wardens' and hobnobbing their pewter quart pots with true\r\nbacchanalian appreciation of the enjoyments of the hour. The results\r\nof too indiscriminate indulgence are noticeable in the dangerous\r\nsituation of those coaches which are attempting to 'homeward wend their\r\nmelancholy way,' and are being overturned in the process by their tipsy\r\ndrivers.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SYMPTOMS OF SANCTITY.]\r\n\r\n_January 20, 1801._ _Symptoms of Sanctity._ Published by S. W. Fores,\r\n50 Piccadilly.--This subject--which, to say the least of it, is\r\nsuggestively bold, though by no means, in our opinion, coming under the\r\nenumeration of 'risky _equivoque_'--might be fittingly described as\r\nSuperstition and Sensuality; the pious belief, amounting to fanaticism,\r\nof the conventual 'Sister' contrasting strongly with the licentious\r\nimpiety of the gross priest.\r\n\r\n_January 30, 1801._ _Single Combat, in Moorfields, or Magnanimous Paul\r\nO! Challenging All O!_ Published by R. Ackermann, 101 Strand.--The ring\r\nis formed in Moorfields, crowds of spectators are gathered around,\r\nthe curious have climbed up every available point of sight, and\r\nobservers are scrambling over the roofs. 'Magnanimous Paul O!' the mad\r\nEmperor, is represented as a Russian bear; his sword is tempered 'à la\r\nSuwarrow,' and his shield is inscribed 'Swallow all O!' The British\r\nchampion, Pitt, encased in a demi-suit of mail, is jauntily meeting\r\nhis adversery; the Minister's sword is tempered 'à la Nelson,' and\r\nthe names of his redoubtable admirals, Howe, Duncan, Nelson, Jervis,\r\nand Parker, are the safeguards of his buckler. A Russian general, who\r\nis acting as his master's squire, is reading Paul's extraordinary\r\ncartel: 'Be it known to all men, that my master, the most magnanimous,\r\nmost puissant, most powerful, and most wonderful Great Bear of the\r\nNorth, being in his sound and sober senses, challenges the whole world\r\nto single combat, and commences his first trial of skill here, in\r\nMoorfields, after which it is his intention to pursue his travels, and\r\nvisit every Court in Europe, Asia, Africa, and America.'\r\n\r\nThe Emperor Paul, who had acquired almost universal popularity at the\r\ncommencement of his reign by putting himself at the head of the allied\r\narmies which were opposing the victorious career of Napoleon, now\r\nastonished his admirers in England by a complete change of policy. He\r\nproclaimed himself Grand Master of Malta, which had been conquered by\r\nus in 1800. The British Government refused to recognise his authority;\r\nthe Emperor in revenge laid an embargo upon all British ships in\r\nRussian ports, and succeeded in inducing the Danish, Swedish, and\r\nPrussian Courts to enter into a convention to protect their commerce\r\nagainst the encroachments of the English. Gillray has drawn the\r\nill-favoured and mad sovereign, under the title '_Mens turpe, corpore\r\nturpi_,' trampling on the treaty of alliance into which he had entered\r\nin concert with Austria and England.\r\n\r\nSome two months after the issue of this caricature the wayward tyranny\r\nof the Emperor, who gave unmistakable evidence of mental aberration,\r\nbecame insupportable, and he was requested to abdicate. Paul\r\nobstinately clung to absolute power, but in spite of his precautions\r\na conspiracy was organised by his disgusted nobles, his palace was\r\nentered, and he was strangled with his own military scarf, which, by\r\nthe way, the satirists always drew of extravagant dimencions well\r\nsuited for such a purpose.\r\n\r\nIt will be remembered that Paul's career was an unfortunate one, and\r\nthe vicissitudes of his youth may have disordered his faculties. On\r\nhis birth his father, Peter the Third, issued a ukase denying the\r\nlegitimacy of his son's paternity: on the publication of this statement\r\nthe Empress put her husband to death. Paul's earlier years were\r\nharassed by trouble, and the last act of his mother was a fruitless\r\neffort to exclude him from the succession. His reign commenced\r\nauspiciously; acts of clemency and munificence distinguished his\r\ngovernment; as the head of the alliance against France he was looked\r\nupon as the legitimate champion of monarchy. After sharing the defeats\r\nsustained by the allied armies his views underwent a remarkable change.\r\nBuonaparte, with his matchless discrimination, contrived to flatter the\r\nEmperor's vanity, and, among other strokes of policy, returned all the\r\nRussian prisoners, well-armed and newly-clad. Paul now entered into\r\na defensive alliance with France to drive the English out of India;\r\nand, to destroy our maritime supremacy, he established the Northern\r\nConfederation for the suppression of British commerce.\r\n\r\nThe caricature _Single Combat in Moorfields_ is founded on an\r\nextraordinary proceeding, which filled Europe with astonishment at\r\nits unequalled eccentricity. The Emperor published an advertisement\r\nin the _Court Gazette_ of St. Petersburg, stating, to the amazement\r\nof the world, that, as 'the Powers could not agree among themselves,\r\nhe intended to point out a spot, to which all the other sovereigns\r\nwere invited to repair, TO FIGHT IN SINGLE COMBAT, bringing with\r\nthem, as seconds and esquires, their most enlightened ministers and\r\nablest generals.' His subjects were continually annoyed by acts of\r\nminor and fantastic oppression--such as an edict against 'round hats\r\nand pantaloons,' which he forbade any person to wear in his empire.\r\nHe enforced the revival of hair-powder and pigtails, and issued a\r\nproclamation to compel all persons whom he encountered in the street to\r\nleave their carriages and prostrate themselves before him. No one was\r\nsafe from his paroxysms. The carriage of the British Ambassador passed\r\nthe Imperial Palace at a pace which the Emperor chose to consider\r\ndisrespectful; he immediately ordered the coachman to be beaten, the\r\nhorses to be beaten, and the carriage to be beaten. The Ambassador in\r\nreturn resented these indignities by discharging his servants, ordering\r\nhis horses to be shot, and his carriage to be thrown into the Neva. An\r\ninsane autocrat was found to be a formidable calamity.\r\n\r\nThe favourable reception accorded to _Country Characters_, _Matrimonial\r\nComforts_, &c., induced Woodward to design further successions of\r\nsubjects, enlisting the assistance of Rowlandson to carry out his\r\nideas. In 1801, the year following, appeared a series of broadsides,\r\n_Prayers_ and _Journals_; each sheet contained a coloured illustration,\r\ndesigned by Woodward and etched by Rowlandson; the space below the\r\ndesign was filled up with descriptive matter from Woodward's pen, that\r\nworthy being given to the cultivation of the various Muses in turn.\r\nThe letterpress, which occupied the larger half of these broadsides,\r\nwas printed by E. Spragg, 27 Bow Street, Covent Garden; and the series\r\nwas published by R. Ackermann, 101 Strand. Our readers will be able to\r\nform an impression of these compositions from the occasional extracts\r\nwe offer; these _Prayers_, _Journals_, &c., are not of sufficient\r\nconsequence to warrant us in offering repetitions at length.\r\n\r\n_February 10, 1801._ _The Old Maid's Prayer._ (Addressed to Diana.)\r\nDesigned by Woodward.

Published\r\nby R. Ackermann.--The devotions of Old Avarice, which are necessarily\r\nvery profound and earnest, are offered appropriately at the feet of\r\nhis divinity, 'Plutus, God of Riches'; the temple of wealth is not\r\nexteriorly sumptuous; the carpet is a rag; a strong-box, a broken\r\nchair, and a rushlight make up the sordid furniture. The miser is\r\nconfessing that he possesses nine houses, estates in Essex, mortgages\r\nin Hertford, large landed speculations in Russell Square and the\r\nneighbourhood, reversions of estates, trading ventures, 'Mermaid'\r\nsloop, funded property, Government securities, &c., &c.; he is\r\nbeseeching an increase of his means, success to his investments, and a\r\nrise in the 'Stocks.'\r\n\r\n_June 4, 1801._ _The Widow's Prayer._--A widow, still young and\r\nblooming, is shown kneeling before the empty chair of the late\r\nlamented partner of her joys; the bereaved lady is looking forward\r\nto consolation; her supplications are offered to Hymen for a fourth\r\nspouse, and she is praying, that should the new husband who is to\r\nfollow be as unfortunate as his predecessors, the number of happy men\r\nmay be extended to seven; or more if need be.\r\n\r\n_June 25, 1801._ _The Maid of Allwork's Prayer._--The picture at the\r\nhead of this invocation represents a neat and pretty young housemaid;\r\nshe is offering up her petitions to the household gods who preside over\r\ncleanliness and good management. The desires of her heart are that a\r\nhandsome fellow-servant may gain the humble worshipper and lead her\r\ninto the _frying-pan_ of matrimony. Let these but be her _wages_ and\r\nshe will submit cheerfully to her labours, nor ever breathe a sigh for\r\ngreater liberty than to _make her bed_ in peace and sleep contented.\r\n\r\n_July 30, 1801._ _The Apothecary's Prayer_ is appropriately offered to\r\nEsculapius, and is truly professional in spirit, since the aspirations\r\nof the little knight of the pestle are turned to the increase of\r\nfevers, catarrhs, gout, cramp, agues, and infirmities in general, for\r\nthe special advantage of his slack professional prospects and the good\r\nof his generous ally the undertaker, who is in need of the apothecary's\r\nfriendly co-operation, the demand for funerals having fallen off of\r\nlate.\r\n\r\n_July 30, 1801._ _The Quack Doctor's Prayer_ is addressed, over a chest\r\nof patent quack medicines, to the illustrious shade of the renowned\r\nDoctor Rock. The empiric candidly confesses that his miraculous\r\n_Cure-all-able Vegetable Drops_, _Never Infailibus Infallibus_,\r\nsupposed to issue from the laboratory of Esculapius himself, are\r\nnothing more than a decoction of beetroot, lump-sugar, spring-water,\r\ncognac brandy, and Hollands gin. The Quack Doctor prays that his\r\ncarriages and equipages, his town and country residences, and all\r\nother good things of life, may be continued to reward his impudent\r\ncharlatanism.\r\n\r\n_August 1, 1801._ _The Stockjobber's Prayer_ is prayed by the pious\r\nspeculator, bank-book in hand, and is offered to the adorable and\r\nancient Lady of Threadneedle Street. The wishes of the stockjobber\r\nrefer to 'rises in the Funds' and 'undertakings in the _Alley_,' and\r\nconclude with a pious hope that he may never have the misfortune to\r\n'_waddle out_ a poor and neglected lame duck.'\r\n\r\n_August 1, 1801._ _The Female Gambler's Prayer_ commences with an\r\ninvocation: 'Enchanting Pharaoh, thee I address with a heart teeming\r\nwith gratitude for all the favours showered on thy ardent worshipper.\r\nThy name, O mighty Pharaoh, is derived from the Hebrew, literally\r\nto _make bare_, and well thou knowest I delight to make bare, even\r\nto the last feather, the pigeon that flies to my midnight orgies.'\r\nThe petition concludes with an entreaty that the Right Honourable\r\nFraternity of Gamblers may be protected from the strictures of Lord\r\nKenyon (who had commenced a crusade against fashionable gamblers, and\r\nhad especially made attacks on those ladies of rank who encouraged\r\ntables in their houses), and their persons preserved from all the dire\r\nhorrors of the stocks and pillory, with which this inflexible judge had\r\nthreatened the incorrigible, if any person could be found to bring them\r\nwithin his jurisdiction.\r\n\r\n_August 10, 1801._ _The Actress's Prayer._--'Hear me, Dramatic Sisters,\r\ngay Thalia and sublime Melpomene; be guardians to your supplicant and\r\naid her in her profession.... I pray thee, should I ever reach the\r\nboards of a London theatre, may my terms be as enormous as my abilities\r\nare conspicuous, and finally my labours be crowned with the _coronet_\r\nof honour, and that I may become a convert to domestic happiness.'\r\n\r\n_August 10, 1801._ _The Jockey's Prayer_ is put up to Nimrod. The\r\naspirations of the hero of the turf tend to a wife--'a pretty well-bred\r\nfilly, one that would come easily to collar, prance to the Circus of\r\nHymen, and run with her owner the generous race of mutual affection.'\r\n\r\n_September 5, 1801._ _The Cook's Prayer._--The fat mistress of the\r\nspit has gone down on her knees before the roaring fire, beside which\r\nare the preparations for dinner. Her prayer is addressed to all the\r\ngods and goddesses whose celestial appetites are not too refined to\r\nrelish the good things of this world. She beseeches their influence to\r\ncontinue her a twelvemonth longer in the service of Alderman Gobble,\r\nand then, with the little perquisites she has hashed together, she may\r\nbe able to enter on a certain eating-house in Pye Corner, which she\r\nhas longed for these three years. She concludes by entreating that the\r\nbosom of John the Coachman may be moved to become her partner in the\r\nconcern.\r\n\r\n_September 12, 1801._ _The Sailor's Prayer._--'O mighty Neptune! hear\r\nan honest British Tar; thou knowest I trouble not thy godship every\r\nday, and I therefore pray thee to grant my prayer, for I love not long\r\npalavering and that there, d'ye see ... Worthy Master Neptune! send us\r\na good prize, I beseech thee, and be not sparing in brandy and tobacco.\r\nGive us also a few chests of the Don's dollars, for Mounseer hasn't got\r\nnone--no more than there is in your three-pronged boat-hook.'\r\n\r\n_September 20, 1801._ _The Publican's Prayer._--'Holy Silenus, father\r\nof all-inspiring Bacchus, continue, I beseech you, the custom of the\r\noriginal Golden Lion, and inspire me, its landlord, with becoming\r\ngratitude for all thy favours. Grant me success, I pray thee, with the\r\nrich widow of the adjoining street, whom thou knowest I adore; send\r\nthat she may frequently look into the bar, till in time she becomes\r\nits fixed ornament. Grant but this addition to my stock in trade, and\r\nI have nothing to ask thee for but plenty of smuggled spirits and\r\nprotection from the exciseman.'\r\n\r\n_September 20, 1801._ _Poll of Portsmouth's Prayer_ is addressed\r\nto Thetis. The supplications of this damsel, who is gaily attired\r\nin bright colours, and ornamented with numerous coral necklaces,\r\nbracelets, watches, seals, lockets, and trinkets, gifts from tars at\r\nsea, are directed to prayers for the safe and speedy return of her\r\nnumerous generous admirers, then on board their ships.\r\n\r\n1801. _The Lottery Office Keeper's Prayer._--This invocation is offered\r\nby a prosperous-looking individual to Dame Fortune, whose portrait\r\nforms the signboard of his establishment, 'Peter Puff's Lucky Lottery\r\nOffice.' He prays the blindfold goddess to grant insurance to his\r\nschemes, so that they may turn up prizes, and prevent his looking\r\nblank when bowing at the altar of his divinity. 'And lastly, I pray\r\nthee, with the indulgent aid of mighty superiferous Somnus, to cause\r\nall old women and children to dream incessantly on the advantages\r\ngained by venturing in the lottery; so shall the nocturnal visions of\r\nold chairs and tables be converted into lucky numbers, and thy humble\r\npetitioner benefited thereby.'\r\n\r\n_March 18, 1801._ _The Union Head-dress._ Published by R.\r\nAckermann, 101 Strand.--A pair of busts, the fancy portraits of two\r\nhighly-caricatured individuals, whose faces wear a most dejected\r\nexpression, from whose respective foreheads branch a pair of\r\nwell-defined horns.--'This style of decoration represents \"The Union\r\nHead-dress,\" successively worn by many respectable citizens since the\r\ndays of Noah; for its simplicity and elegance it cannot be too much\r\nadmired. Respectfully dedicated to the fashion-mongers of 1801.' The\r\nsatire of this print, which appears somewhat coarse and uncalled-for,\r\nis levelled at the fashion, which raged contemporaneously with its\r\npublication, for embodying in the reigning mode any event which\r\nhappened to be stirring, no matter its frivolity or gravity, as the\r\ncase might be. The accomplishment of the union between England and\r\nIreland was seized by the milliners and fashion-mongers as the excuse\r\nfor a thousand extravagances in head-dresses, combining supposititious\r\nemblems of the twin kingdoms with allusions to their happy conjunction.\r\n\r\n_April 2, 1801._ No. 1, _Taste_.

The establishment of Mrs. Woods\r\nis evidently the rock a-head which threatens the venerable senator;\r\nMrs. Woods, the lady abbess, is, with one of her decoying nymphs,\r\nstanding at the door of her mansion; two more syrens are beckoning the\r\npasser-by from a window, and various houris appear above, all issuing\r\ntheir invitations to the M.P., an individual of consideration. The\r\namorous character of the vicinity is indicated by the circumstances\r\nsurrounding a coach, which is driving by. The coachman has a pretty\r\ngirl on his box, and while he is publicly saluting her cheek, his fare,\r\nan officer, is kissing a fair companion in the vehicle, and two street\r\nArabs, a boy and a girl, are stealing a ride on the back, and they too\r\nare indulging in a loving embrace, disregarding the insecurity of their\r\nsituation.\r\n\r\n1801.

A working tailor, who is snapping his shears at his\r\nadversary, in the excitement of the cause, and dressed as he has left\r\nhis shop-board, is the plaintiff; the defendant has brought a pair of\r\nnether garments into court as evidence; he is resolutely endeavouring\r\nto support his case, while the small clothes in question are held out\r\nat the end of his cane for the investigation of the obviously reluctant\r\njudge, who does not appear to relish the too familiar vicinity of such\r\nunusual testimony.\r\n\r\n_June 15, 1802._ _A Parish Officer's Journal._ Woodward del.,\r\nRowlandson sculp.

Fores, 50 Piccadilly.--A 'fine lady,' presumably an _Anonyma_\r\nof the period, finds herself in the fastness of a spunging house;\r\nshe is made as welcome as circumstances will permit; a bottle of\r\nwine, the refreshment customary, is ordered, and the stern hearts of\r\nthe sheriff's men are appealed to, while bail is sent for. It was a\r\nwell-known practice at the beginning of the century, and earlier,\r\nto pay some obscure individual a trifling fee to become security on\r\nemergencies. Similar fictitious householders were always in attendance,\r\nand producible from the bar-rooms in the neighbourhood. In the present\r\ncase a professional limb, of the Hebrew persuasion, is presented,\r\ndecently made up for the occasion, to tender himself as bondsman for\r\nthe lady's due appearance. It is evident, however, that a suspicious\r\nrecognition is taking place; 'Harry Holdfast, Officer to the Four\r\nCounties,' or his deputy, does not, judging from his expression, seem\r\nto approve of the surety, and the Jew looks somewhat disconcerted\r\nunder his inspection. The tears of the unfortunate captive, and\r\nthe plausible reassurances--as to the respectability of the bail\r\noffered--of her chaperone, or duenna, are powerless to move the stoic\r\nbreast of the experienced catchpole.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SLYBOOTS.]\r\n\r\n_July 1, 1802._ _Slyboots._ Published by S.

The tailor, with his\r\nmeasure round his neck, is snipping his shears viciously above the head\r\nof a blushing maiden, who is covered with becoming confusion at her\r\ndetection. The figure of a sturdy apprentice, seen disappearing in the\r\nrear, is sufficient to account for the _contre-temps_.\r\n\r\n_July 18, 1802._ _The Corporal in Good Quarters._ Published by S.\r\nHowitt, Panton Street, Haymarket.--The marvellous influence of a red\r\ncoat is the subject of the present sketch. Who can resist a dashing\r\nyoung soldier? The rustic beauty seems unequivocally smitten, and does\r\nnot disguise the compromising fact that 'she dotes on the military.'\r\nThe gallant son of Mars has been quartered on a prosperous farmer, who\r\nloves good cheer and brave company; the corporal is made welcome at bed\r\nand board, and the best in the house is prepared for his delectation.\r\nThe venerable Hawbuck does not, however, seem pleased with the way his\r\nguest is carrying on with his buxom daughter, who is but too clearly\r\nsmitten with the soldier's charming freedoms and his fine feathers;\r\nit is more than the parent bargained for, and even his dog is looking\r\non with astonishment. But the scandalised parent and the young rustic\r\nlounging in the doorway, possibly an acknowledged sweetheart, are at\r\na discount; their authority is likely to be set at defiance. As for\r\nthe disconcerted swain whose dejected air and attitude express the\r\nprofundity of his despair, he will probably do something desperate;\r\nin dudgeon at his blighted hopes he may very likely fall under the\r\nbeguiling corporal's spell, offer himself as a recruit, be 'listed,\r\nand thenceforth forsake the plough-tail to follow the drum; a lasting\r\ntext against one of the many evils consequent upon the maintenance of a\r\nstanding army.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE CORPORAL IN GOOD QUARTERS.]\r\n\r\n_August 30, 1802._ _A Musical Family._ Published by R.

The\r\npersonal belongings of the deceased--her watch, little articles\r\nof jewellery, and plate--have evidently been ransacked by this\r\naffectionate pair of unaffected and disinterested mourners. An open\r\nbook displays this familiar quotation, bearing somewhat disrespectful\r\napplication to the case of the departed:--\r\n\r\n    A smoky house and a scolding wife\r\n    Are the plagues of man's life.\r\n    Oh, what pleasure will abound\r\n    When my wife is laid in ground!\r\n\r\n_November 20, 1802._ _Doctor Convex and Lady Concave._ Published by R.\r\nAckermann.\r\n\r\n1802. _Hunt the Slipper, Pic-Nic Revels._ Rowlandson del. and publisher.\r\n\r\nMen are but children of a larger growth.--SHAKESPEARE.\r\n\r\nThe chairs have been cleared out of a large apartment, and a party of\r\nfull-grown men and women, some of whom have long passed maturity, are\r\nseated on the floor for a game at 'high jinks.' Bowls of punch, bottles\r\nof wine, and abundant refreshments of a strong nature, are put on the\r\nground behind, within easy reach of the revellers, who are in the full\r\nenjoyment of a boisterous game of 'hunt the slipper.' The party is made\r\nup of an abundance of pretty rosy damsels, blooming, blushing, and\r\nsmiling, such as Rowlandson with his etching needle or his reed pen\r\ncould produce at will, and in every degree of perfection; corpulent\r\nmatrons, dowagers, and gothic old maids are likewise plentiful. There\r\nis a gentleman to every lady, and the whole scene is a very animated\r\none; while the fun is apparently appreciated by the performers, who are\r\nentering into the spirit of the diversion.

The\r\nscene represents the interior of _a Bagnio_, '_Hot and Cold Baths_,\r\n_cupping_, _sweating_, &c., &c.' From the picture it would seem\r\nthat the bath-attendants of the period, who administered the rough\r\ntowellings and flesh brushings, which are indicated in the plate,\r\nwere not of the sex one generally expects to find discharging these\r\nfunctions in our own day. In the case of _The Diver_ no very glaring\r\nimpropriety is suggested--the individual in question is like a ball of\r\nflesh; the image, on an exaggerated scale, of the Chinese joss-figures,\r\nand literally perfectly spherical; his quaint image is reflected in the\r\nwater as he plunges forward in a sort of cricket-ball bound; a print of\r\nNarcissus gazing on his form in the fountain, suspended on the wall,\r\nsuggests a sufficiently striking contrast.\r\n\r\n_April 12, 1803._ _Ducking a Scold._\r\n\r\n_May 1, 1803._ _John Bull Listening to the Quarrels of State Affairs._\r\n(Treaty of Amiens.)

'Mon grand Maître, bid a you read dat, Monsieur.' John\r\nBull replies: 'Um, let your Grand Master read that, Mounseer':--'John\r\nBull does not rightly understand the Chief Consul's lingo, but supposes\r\nhe means something about invasion; therefore the said John Bull deems\r\nit necessary to observe that if his consular Highness dares attempt\r\nto invade any ladies or gentlemen on his coast, he'll be damned if he\r\ndon't sink him!'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1804.\r\n\r\n\r\n_January 1, 1804._ _Diana in the Straw, or a Treat for Quornites._\r\nPublished by S. W. Fores.\r\n\r\n_January 2, 1804._ _A French Ordinary._ (Originally published in\r\n1801.) S. W. Fores, 50 Piccadilly.--The attractions of a cheap French\r\ntable d'hôte are ludicrously set forth; while the ravenous diners are\r\nrepresented making the best use of their opportunities within the\r\n_salle à manger_, the delicate character of the attendance and the\r\nculinary department are slyly hinted. We are admitted to the secrets\r\nof _la cuisine Française_, as they have seemingly been revealed to\r\nthe caricaturist. The slovenly old cook is emptying the morsels left\r\nfrom the plates of the customers, into the capacious _pot-au-feu_, to\r\nreappear dished up for succeeding _convives_. A lean cat is seated in\r\nthe frying pan, probably in course of fattening for the spit; as to the\r\nlarder, the main provisions consist of dead cats and frogs; it was an\r\naccepted axiom that all the _Jean Crapauds_, as our Gallic neighbours\r\nwere playfully christened by John Bull, lived more or less on frogs.\r\nRowlandson, as we have shown, had French relatives, and had studied\r\nin Paris and spoke the language with fluency; while those travellers\r\nwho were familiar with native habits, from travelling abroad, stoutly\r\nmaintained that such were the staples of the national food, being\r\nconvinced of the truth of the formula, as asserted by the waggish Peter\r\nPindar--'I've liv'd among them and have eat their frogs!'\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A FRENCH ORDINARY.]\r\n\r\n_June 8, 1804._ _Light Volunteers on a March._ Published by R.\r\nAckermann.\r\n\r\n_June 8, 1804._ _Light Infantry Volunteers on a March._ Published by\r\nAckermann.\r\n\r\n_July 31, 1804._ _The Imperial Coronation._ Published by R.\r\nAckermann.--The platform which has been erected for this celebration is\r\nmore suggestive of an execution than a coronation; a body of the old\r\nGuards, in their bear-skin caps, surround the raised space. The Pope\r\nis present in full canonicals, to perform the ceremony in person. A\r\ngallows has been considerately provided, in order to lower the imperial\r\ncrown on to the brows of the future wearer more conveniently. On\r\nthe gallows is painted, 'Patrick Death, Gibbet-maker to his Imperial\r\nMajesty the Emperor of all the Gulls.' The Pope, who holds the string,\r\nwhich works over a pulley, and suspends the Crown, is crying somewhat\r\nirreverently: 'In a little while you shall see him, and in a little\r\nwhile you shall not see him.' The weight of the diadem is too much for\r\nthe wearer and his new throne, the planks of the platform are broken\r\nthrough, and the future emperor is sinking beneath, while calling to\r\nhis confederate Talleyrand, 'My dear Talleyrand, save me! my throne is\r\ngiving way. I am afraid the foundation is rotten, and wants a cursed\r\ndeal of mending!' His prime minister is much concerned, 'Ah, master,\r\nthe crown is too heavy for you!'\r\n\r\nAnother pillar of the Church is pointing out that the Corsican has\r\nnot acted with his usual cunning, 'You forgot your old Uncle, the\r\nnew bishop--if you had made me Pope I should have let the crown down\r\neasier!' The ceremony is parodied in the background, monkeys taking the\r\nplace of the actual performers, only in this case the imperial ape is\r\nseated in state, with sceptre and orb, in greater security.\r\n\r\n1804. _Theatrical Leap-frog._ Published by Ackermann, Strand.--The\r\nyoung Roscius, as an infant prodigy, is flying over the back of Kemble,\r\nboth the performers being dressed in the habit then customary for\r\nHamlet--'Alas!' cries Kemble, 'is it come to this? Ah, woe is me!\r\nseeing what I have seen, seeing what I see! O Roscius!'\r\n\r\n_December, 1804._ _Melpomene in the Dumps, or Child's Play defended by\r\nTheatrical Monarchs._ Published by Ackermann, Strand.--Mrs. Siddons in\r\ntragic swathings, one arm resting on a table, her other hand extended\r\nin an interlocutory attitude, while her foot is resting on a stool; on\r\nthe table are books--_Salary Benefits_, _The Rights of Woman_, and _The\r\nDuty of Man_. On the wall is hung Bunbury's _Propagation of a Lie_.\r\nJohn Philip Kemble is resting his hand on her shoulder, and another\r\ngentleman, hat in hand, is pointing with his finger to a shorter\r\nfigure, probably intended for the person of Colonel Topham, Editor of\r\n_The World_, '_More Soldier than Scholar!_'\r\n\r\n                        THE DEBATE OR ARGUMENT.\r\n\r\n     _Melpomene._ And pray, Mr. Monarch, how long am I to be confined\r\n     to this _box fever_, or nervous rheumatism in my loins? A pretty\r\n     business you have made of this season; what between your _Blind\r\n     Bargain_ and _Infant Roscius_, you think to send me to the ground;\r\n     but let me caution you, that 'if once I do but stir or lift this\r\n     arm, the best of you shall sink in my rebuke. Give me to know how\r\n     this foul rout began, who set it on, and he that is approved in\r\n     the offence, though he hath twinned with me, _both at a birth_\r\n     shall lose me.'\r\n\r\n     _First Monarch._ [Probably intended to designate Sheridan.] Why\r\n     really, Madam, all I can say in my defence or that of my _Infant_\r\n     is this, that if John Bull chooses to feed on slink calf, instead\r\n     of substantial roast beef, _yet consents to pay for the roast_,\r\n     it is not for me to complain; but, Madam, should there be a fault\r\n     laid at my charge, let me tell you it is not entirely mine; your\r\n     brother here, beside me, has had _his share_ in it, and between\r\n     friends, I must observe, that you have had your day; and if a\r\n     good salary during this _Infant fever_ and frigid weather cannot\r\n     encourage you to wear flannel, gird up your loins, and rest\r\n     contented on your arm (I mean arms). I will be bound to say, you\r\n     are not the woman I took you for; and rather than _be subject_ to\r\n     such complaints while I _reign_ 'King of shreds and patches,' I\r\n     would forego the advantages of government, and 'live on scraps at\r\n     proud men's surly doors.'\r\n\r\n     _Second Monarch._ [John Philip Kemble, otherwise familiarly\r\n     designated _Black Jack_.] Sister, be of comfort, our friend speaks\r\n     home; you may relish him more in the soldier than the scholar, but\r\n     though his oratory is bad, his _argumentum argentum_ is good; his\r\n     voice like mine is husky; but his _silver_ tones are delightful.\r\n     It is true we have both had our day; 'our May of life is gone;\r\n     'tis fallen into the sear, the yellow leaf, and that which should\r\n     accompany old age' _we have got_. 'The world's a stage, and all\r\n     the men and women merely players.' Public taste is similar, it\r\n     is now in second childishness; and when mere oblivion takes\r\n     place, then you shall make a sally, and should the Town require a\r\n     _filip_,[4] I will be at your elbow.\r\n\r\n_December 14, 1804._ _The Death of Madame République._--The moribund\r\nRépublique is stretched on her death-bed, the tricolour cockade is\r\nworn on the side of her nightcap; by the side are bottles of _Purging\r\nMixture_ and _Laudanum_. _Vive la Liberté_ and _Vive la République_\r\nare put out of sight; the Abbé Sièyes, as doctor, is holding the new\r\nEmperor, an infant in long clothes, the crown is on his head, a sceptre\r\nand orb are in either hand. John Bull, spectacles on nose, and with his\r\nhand in his waistcoat pocket, has stepped in; he is much astonished at\r\nthe change of affairs: 'Pray Mr. Abbé Sièyes, what was the cause of the\r\npoor Lady's death? She seemed at one time in a tolerable thriving way.'\r\n'She died in childbed, Mr. Bull, after giving birth to this little\r\nEmperor!'\r\n\r\n1804. _A New French Phantasmagoria._ (The date 1805 in one\r\ncorner.)--Napoleon Buonaparte, with the Imperial crown, sceptre,\r\norb, and robes of state, is holding out his hand, with impertinent\r\ncondescension, crying, 'What! my old friend, Mr. Bull, don't you know\r\nme?' John Bull is dressed in sailor fashion, as the 'champion of the\r\nseas;' there is an air of satirical quizzing about his features,\r\nand, in order that he may be able to distinguish his transmogrified\r\nacquaintance, he has mounted a pair of huge magnifiers, 'Bless me,\r\nwhat comes here, it's time to put on my large spectacles, and tuck up\r\nmy trousers! Why, surely, it can't be?--it is Boney too, for all that;\r\nwhy, what game be'est thee at now? Acting a play mayhap? What hast thee\r\ngot on thy head there? Always at some new freak or other.'\r\n\r\n1804. _A Compendious Treatise of Modern Education_, in which the\r\nfollowing interesting subjects are liberally discussed: The Nursery,\r\nPrivate Schools, Public Schools, Universities, Gallantry, Duelling,\r\nGaming, and Suicide; to which are added coloured designs, both\r\ncharacteristic and illustrative.

The house of a quack practitioner in 'Rotten Row,' one Dr.\r\nHumbug, at the sign of the Golden Pestle of Hippocrates, who advertises\r\n'advice gratis' on his front door, is the scene of a general muster\r\nof the inquisitors and collectors of taxes. _Window Tax_, _Income_,\r\n_Property_, _House_, _Servants_, _Horses_, _Dogs_, _&c._, are among the\r\nrequisitions to be levied. _The Budget opened, or how to raise the wind\r\nfor the year 1805_ explains these visitations. The quack and his wife\r\nare declining to admit their duns; they are surveying the besieging\r\nparty from an upper window, and the _goodwill_ of their house is,\r\naccording to a placard, _to be disposed of_. The prospect of 'Houses to\r\nLet' and of windows 'Blocked up' shows that taxation was pressing with\r\nover-severity, and had, in reality, been carried beyond a joke.\r\n\r\n_February 25, 1805._ _The Famous Coal Heaver, Black Charley, looking\r\ninto the Mouth of the Wonderful Coal Pit._ Published by Ackermann.\r\nDescribed by an English Yeoman.

The\r\nabbot of St. Stephen's, with mitre and crozier, ensconced in his niche,\r\nis in consternation at the work going on. The horses are all standing\r\nwith their heads turned to their stalls, and their hoofs to the\r\npurifier. Dundas (Lord Melville) is kicking with energy, crying 'What\r\nthe Deel is the man aboot?' Wilberforce's 'Broom for the suppression\r\nof Vice' is between his legs, and before him is a huge private chest\r\nfor stray provender, with money bags outside. Trotter stands next; he\r\ncries, 'Attack the Gallopers! I am only a poor Trotter.' Pitt, a very\r\nbony steed, is crying, 'I am afraid we shall all be drenched in turn;'\r\nand a crowd of others are thrown into confusion at their prospects,\r\nsaying, 'Who could have expected this?'

Rowlandson, 1 James Street, Adelphi.\r\nRepublished July 14, 1812.--The features of a sudden rise in life form\r\nhumorous materials in the hands of the caricaturist. The lately created\r\nnobleman, a coarse and common clothier, is swaggering in all his new\r\nfinery, to give his past associates a taste of his new-found honours.\r\nHis showy court dress is assumed with awkward pretension; he wears a\r\nribbon and star and a dress sword; none of these decorations harmonise\r\nwith the wearer, who is so evidently out of place in his fine feathers,\r\nthat the journeymen tailors and cobblers, his neighbours and recent\r\ncomrades, are jeering at his burlesque dignity; his lady dressed in\r\nunbecoming finery, and carrying a large plume of feathers on her head,\r\nlooks no less 'out of character' than does her tailoring spouse. The\r\nshop, over which appears, _Stitchall, Whitechapel, Breeches cleaned and\r\nrepaired_, once the pride of the pair, is now closed. A placard states:\r\n'The goodwill of this shop to be sold, removed to Grosvenor Square;'\r\nwhile an old Jewess, part of the establishment, probably the ancestress\r\nof one of the pair, is trying her hardest, on the top of some steps, to\r\nwipe out the offensive name of the ex-proprietor.\r\n\r\n_July 14, 1805._ _Antiquarians à la Grecque._ Published by R.\r\nAckermann.\r\n\r\n_October 1, 1805._ _The Departure from the Coast, or the end of\r\nthe Farce of Invasion._ Published by Ackermann.--On the heights of\r\nthe English coast stands the British Lion, contemptuously pouring\r\na broadside into the retreating invader; the British cruisers are\r\nsweeping the seas. The Emperor, seated on a donkey, is limping off,\r\nto the delight of some French monkeys. The national prototype's\r\ncontributions, in the shape of a shower of shot, have capsized the\r\niron crown of Milan. 'Bless me, what a shower! I shall be wet through\r\nbefore I reach the Rhine.' The Emperor and his steed are overloaded\r\nwith sacks of _Excuses for non-performance_. _The Boulogne Encampment_\r\nand _The Army of England_ fill his pockets, while files of soldiers are\r\nindicated above.\r\n\r\n_October 2, 1805._ _John Bull at the Opera._ Published by T.\r\nRowlandson.--It is a matter of no surprise to find Rowlandson, who,\r\nin spite of his acquaintance with the Continent, was as thoroughly\r\nconfirmed a John Bull as his illustrious predecessor Hogarth,\r\nridiculing the tastes of the fashionable public, who patronised and\r\npetted exotic artists, to the neglect of native talent. Like the rest\r\nof the caricaturists, he traded on the national spirit, and held up\r\nforeigners to contempt and ridicule; with a happy faculty for seizing\r\ntheir grotesque points, their loose ways of life, and their love of\r\nfinery and display, which has not, we will venture to believe, been\r\nexcelled in any day. It is natural the school-fellow, fellow-student\r\nat the Academy, and familiar intimate through life, of such a talented\r\nEnglish performer as Bannister, should have resented the artificial\r\ntaste which heaped wealth on comparatively obscure aliens, with whose\r\nart plain John Bull could have slight sympathy, while the most rarely\r\ngifted of his countrymen were left to struggle through life without a\r\ndue acknowledgment, in a pecuniary sense, proportioned to the extent of\r\ntheir merits, as contrasted with the abilities of their foreign rivals,\r\nand the fabulous salaries they received. The designer has accordingly\r\ndisplayed the signor from a whimsical point of view; the face of the\r\nperformer is suggestive of that of the good-looking youth, the leading\r\nfigure in the eccentric humours of an _Italian Family_ (1792); it was\r\nprobably a portrait recognisable at the period. Certainly John Bull, in\r\nthe artist's view, does not appear much at home at the Italian Opera;\r\nthe spectators are divided between gigglers and gapers, and on the\r\nwhole it is doubtful if their imported entertainer affords his audience\r\nthe unequivocal enjoyment they would have been able to secure at the\r\nhands of 'honest Jack Bannister,' and native performers of his stamp.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: JOHN BULL AT THE ITALIAN OPERA.]\r\n\r\n_October 30, 1805._ _Raising the Wind._\r\n\r\n_November 13, 1805._ _Napoleon Buonaparte in a Fever, on Receiving the\r\nextraordinary Gazette of Nelson's Victory over the Combined Fleets._\r\nPublished by Ackermann.--The Emperor, in his huge cocked hat, is\r\nseriously indisposed, after reading the extraordinary gazette: '19\r\nsail of the line taken by Lord Nelson.'

According to the notice-board,\r\nthere seems no reason to question this being a 'finishing school'\r\nin the fullest acceptation of the expression. 'The young ideas' are\r\nshooting in a precocious fashion which is setting the restraint of the\r\ngovernesses at defiance. Certain well-favoured young house painters\r\nare inciting the mischievous hoydens to disregard the injunctions of\r\ntheir preceptresses. A daring scamp is stealing a kiss from a buxom\r\nbelle, over the eaves of the adjoining house, and three terrible young\r\nflirts are exchanging pleasantries with a youth on a ladder, who is\r\nstopping the torrent of menace, poured forth by the mistress, by\r\nbedaubing his whitewash brush in the learned features of the infuriated\r\nold lady. It is evidently early morning, before the customary studies\r\nhave commenced.\r\n\r\n1805. _Glowworms._ (See July, 1812.)\r\n\r\n1805. _Muckworms._\r\n\r\n1805.

It is not easy to conceive a much more\r\ntremendous figure than he now exhibited. He had on, as we have said,\r\na light coloured coat, covered with streams of blood. His face, which\r\nmissed that very blood, as well as twenty ounces more drawn from him by\r\nthe surgeon, was pallid. Round his head was a quantity of bandages, not\r\nunlike a turban. In the right hand he carried a sword, and in the left\r\na candle. So that the bloody Banquo was not worthy to be compared to\r\nhim. In fact, I believe a more dreadful apparition was never raised in\r\na churchyard, nor in the imagination of any good people met in a winter\r\nevening over a Christmas fire in Somersetshire.\r\n\r\n'When the sentinel first saw our hero approach, his hair began gently\r\nto lift up his grenadier cap, and in the same instant his knees fell to\r\nblows with each other. Presently his whole body was seized with worse\r\nthan an ague fit. He then fired his piece, and fell flat on his face.\r\n\r\n'Whether fear or courage was the occasion of his firing, or whether he\r\ntook aim at the object of his terror, I cannot say. If he did, however,\r\nhe had the good fortune to miss his man.\r\n\r\n'Jones seeing the fellow fall, guessed the cause of his fright, at\r\nwhich he could not forbear smiling, not in the least reflecting on the\r\ndanger from which he had just escaped. He then passed by the fellow,\r\nwho still continued in the posture in which he fell.... The report of\r\nthe firelock alarmed the whole house....\r\n\r\n'Before Jones could reach the door of his chamber, the hall where the\r\nsentinel had been posted was half full of people, some in their shirts,\r\nand others not half dressed, all very earnestly inquiring of each other\r\nwhat was the matter.\r\n\r\n'The soldier was now found lying in the same place and posture in which\r\nwe just now left him. Several immediately applied themselves to raise\r\nhim, and some concluded him dead; but they presently saw their mistake,\r\nfor he not only struggled with those who laid their hands on him, but\r\nfell a roaring like a bull. In reality he imagined so many spirits or\r\ndevils were handling him; for his imagination, being possessed with the\r\nhorror of an apparition, converted every object he saw or felt into\r\nnothing but ghosts and spectres.\r\n\r\n'At length he was overpowered by numbers, and got upon his legs; when\r\ncandles being brought, and seeing two or three of his comrades present,\r\nhe came a little to himself; but when they asked him what was the\r\nmatter, he answered, \"I am a dead man, that's all; I am a dead man; I\r\ncan't recover it; I have seen him.\"'\r\n\r\n'\"What hast thou seen, Jack?\" says one of the soldiers. \"Why, I have\r\nseen the young volunteer that was killed yesterday.\"'\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE SENTINEL MISTAKES TOM JONES FOR AN APPARITION.]\r\n\r\nIllustrations to Fielding's _Tom Jones_ (See 1791). 1791-93.

Above the balustrade stands the guilty\r\ndamsel, who has had sufficient warning, as her lover, carrying his\r\ngarments in his hand, for expedition, is making his way from the\r\nniece's room under the cover of an ambuscade; while the lady is leaning\r\nover the staircase railings, with an air of startled innocence assumed\r\nto carry off the _contretemps_.\r\n\r\n_May, 1806_. _Recruiting on a Broad-Bottom'd Principle._ Published by\r\nT. Blacklock, 92 Royal Exchange.--Grenville, Fox, and their colleagues,\r\nare out on a recruiting expedition, to enlist volunteers for their new\r\nservice. Lord Grenville, as the recruiting sergeant, is haranguing\r\nthe bystanders; his followers are rather of the tatterdemalion order:\r\nthey wear the red caps of Liberty, and the revolutionary cockades,\r\nthey are out-at-elbows and shoeless. Sheridan is waving the colours\r\ninscribed 'God save the King! No Jacobins!' Fox is drummer, Lord\r\nDerby is fifer; 'Now my brave fellows, now is the time to make your\r\nfortunes and show your loyalty, all on a Broad-Bottom'd principle: we\r\ndon't value _candle-ends_ and _cheese-parings_, not we!

A dog, the _Member for Barkshire_ according to his\r\ncollar, is bow-wowing the sergeant's address; one of the audience, with\r\na paper, _Bed of Roses_ (to which the ministerial condition had been\r\nlikened by Lord Castlereagh), in his pocket, is half decided to join\r\ntheir standard: 'I don't like a bed of Down, I would rather it was a\r\n_Bed of Roses_: however I have a great mind to enter notwithstanding,\r\nthere is nothing like having two strings to one's bow.'\r\n\r\nGeorge the Third is peeping through his spyglass; he is not very clear\r\nas to the actual motives of the party: 'What, what! my sergeant and\r\ndrummer beating up for volunteers; that's right, that's right, get as\r\nmany as you can!'\r\n\r\n_May 4, 1806._ _Daniel Lambert, the wonderful great Pumpkin of Little\r\nBritain._ Published by R. Ackermann, 101 Strand.--The famous Leicester\r\ngiant, or rather fat man, Daniel Lambert, was the object of fashionable\r\ncuriosity at this date. The worthy and good-natured-looking monster's\r\nfigure is set forth at full, and justice is done to his corpulence. A\r\ntailor and his journeyman are between them vainly trying to stretch\r\ntheir measuring tape round the colossal girth; a fairly conditioned\r\nman-cook has just brought in a noble rib of beef for the regalement of\r\nthe giant. Three modishly dressed persons of quality, who have come to\r\nadmire the huge proportions of Daniel Lambert, are contrasting their\r\nown meagre condition of genteel slimness with his excessive plumpness.\r\nA notice sets forth, 'Agricultural society for the improvement of fat\r\ncattle. Leicestershire Ram'; and a placard advertises, 'The powers of\r\nRoast Beef, or the Leicestershire Apollo, now in full bloom; no blemish\r\nwhatever on any part of his body. Thirty-six years of age.

Rowlandson, 1 James Street, Adelphi.--The unpopular increase\r\nof Taxation, levied under the Broad-bottom'd auspices, was severely\r\ndealt with by the satirists. In the present version, the Ministers\r\nare represented as the crew of a diving-barge, _The Experiment_. Fox\r\nis the diver, and a noble wreck, the 'Constitution cutter, John Bull\r\ncommander,' has gone down to the bottom of the 'Ocean of Taxation.' Her\r\ncommander is done for; amidst the spoils of the shipwreck, the Diver\r\n(Fox) is securing certain weighty additions to his treasury: pig-iron,\r\nBeer Tax, and heavy chests, '10 per cent.' are among the spoils. A rope\r\nis secured to the ponderous Property Tax; Fox is giving the word to\r\n'Haul up;' Petty, Sheridan and others are hauling away at the ropes;\r\ntheir lighter is nearly filled with the precious wreckage they have\r\nbeen able to secure.\r\n\r\n_June 20, 1806._ _The Acquittal, or upsetting the Porter Pot._\r\nPublished by T. Rowlandson, 1 James Street, Adelphi.--Lord Melville and\r\nhis counsel are exulting over the results of his acquittal by his peers\r\nof the charge of investing the public funds for his personal advantage,\r\nas far as the interest was concerned, a perquisite previously allowed\r\nto the Treasurer of the Navy. When Lord Melville, then Henry Dundas,\r\nfilled the post of Treasurer to the Navy, he brought in an act for\r\nthe better regulation of that office, making such employment of the\r\nfunds in hand a misdemeanour; Whitbread, (at the head of the advanced\r\nLiberals, or 'Radical Reformers,' who began to make his party dreaded\r\nas formidable opponents of the old-fashioned Whig section, from which\r\nhis supporters had receded), and Wilberforce, as the enemy of all\r\ncorruptions, were the principal movers of Melville's impeachment, for\r\nthe alleged breach of his own act.\r\n\r\nThe two Scots, Melville and Trotter, who are dressed in Highland\r\ngarb, are embracing fraternally; at the same time, Melville is giving\r\na sly backward kick to a huge pewter pot, bearing the face of the\r\ndisconcerted mover of the charges. _Whitbread's Entire Butt_ is knocked\r\nover, its contents _Impeachments_, _High Crimes_, _Misdemeanours_,\r\nand _Peculation_, are flowing away unheeded; 'What is life without a\r\nfriend?' cries the ex-Minister on his acquittal; his counsel, Trotter,\r\nis assuring his relieved patron, 'I'll _trot_ for you! I'll gallop for\r\nyou all over the globe. O happy day for Scotland! and see how pleased\r\nJohn Bull looks--ah Johnny, Johnny, this is indeed a glorious triumph.'\r\nBut Mr. Bull declines to be soft-sawdered: his face is wearing anything\r\nbut a satisfied expression; he significantly keeps his hands in his\r\npockets, and is grumbling, 'I say nothing,' as if he could say a great\r\ndeal if he were disposed to express his honest opinion of the entire\r\ntransaction.\r\n\r\n_July 21, 1806._ _Experiments at Dover, or Master Charleys Magic\r\nLantern._ Published by T. Rowlandson, 1 James Street, Adelphi.--The\r\nrepeated delays to the preliminaries for peace, and the various\r\nmanoeuvres of Buonaparte's government, which protracted the issue of\r\nFox's policy, led to a feeling out-of-doors that the Minister was not\r\ndealing straightforwardly with the public; that dissimulation was\r\nthrown into their eyes like dust; and that the Whig chief was deluding\r\nhis followers for some reasons of his own; meanwhile the Corsican\r\nEmperor was carrying forward plans for fresh aggressions unchecked.\r\n\r\nFox, in the print, has settled himself comfortably at Dover; with a\r\nmagic lantern to work his delusions, he is throwing painted images\r\nacross the Channel, which are reflected on the cliffs of Calais.\r\nThe figure of Napoleon is seen sounding a news-horn, announcing\r\n'Preliminaries of Peace'; Fox's slide contains other views, which have\r\nto follow, for the further perplexity of the honest spectator: 'More\r\ndespatches,' 'Messenger to Paris,' 'Messenger from Boulogne,' &c. The\r\nShowman is trying to reassure his friend, 'There, Master Bull, what\r\ndo you think of that? I told you I would surprise you--\"Preliminaries\r\nof Peace,\" 'Huzza!' John Bull, who is standing unconvinced behind\r\nFox's chair, replies: 'Yes, yes, it be all very foine, if it be true.\r\nBut I can't forget that d----d Omnium last week; they be always one\r\nway or other in contradictions! I will tell thee what, Charley, since\r\nthee hast become a great man, I think in my heart thee beest always\r\nconjuring.'\r\n\r\n_June, 1806._ _Butterfly Hunting._ Published by Wm. Holland, 11\r\nCockspur Street.--A collision between the pursuits of rival enthusiasts\r\nis pictured under the title of 'Butterfly Hunting.' Nothing can\r\nstop the fervour of the butterfly collectors in their chase of the\r\nsportive prey, wantonly flitting all over the flower-beds, and leading\r\nthe excited entomologists a pretty dance, carrying destruction to\r\nthe parterres, and ruination to the tulips, of which the proprietor\r\nof the house and grounds is, it appears, a passionate fancier. The\r\nhavoc, which is spreading over the beds of his favourites, is reducing\r\nhim to frenzy; as he is awakened from his rest, and surveys from his\r\nbedroom-window the field of action, the only wonder is, if he has a\r\nloaded gun ready at hand, that he is not tempted to salute the reckless\r\nspoilers with a volley.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BUTTERFLY-HUNTING.]\r\n\r\n1806. _A Prize Fight._\r\n\r\n1806 (?). _Anything will do for an Officer._--The caricature of a\r\npigmy and misshapen sample of humanity, dressed as an officer, with an\r\nenormous cocked hat, worn on one side of his battered and lined old\r\nface; a long pigtail projects over his high shoulders; he swaggers with\r\none hand on his hip, and the other on the head of a tasseled cane,\r\nwhich is nearly as tall as the hero himself; his shrunken spindle\r\nlegs are thrust into huge boots, and his tremendous sword, which is\r\nlonger than the wearer, is trailing on the ground. The argument is not\r\ncomplimentary to commanders in general: 'Some school-boys, who were\r\nplaying at soldiers, found one of their number so ill-made and so\r\nundersized that he would have disfigured the whole body if put into\r\nthe ranks. \"What shall we do with him?\" asked one, \"Do with him?\" says\r\nanother, \"why make an officer of him!\"'\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A PRIZE FIGHT.]\r\n\r\n1806. _View of the Interior of Simon Ward, alias St. Brewer's Church,\r\nCornwall._--A quaint delineation of a church-interior during service;\r\nthe pastor, who is somewhat of the Dr. Syntax type, is holding forth.\r\nThere is a squire's pew, a rosy, sleepy clerk, a large leavening\r\nof fat slumberers (among the rest the sexton and pew-opener), a\r\ncrowded gallery, worshippers both devout and careless, gazers through\r\ncuriosity, and the usual elements which made up a grotesque-looking\r\ncountry congregation at the end of the last century.\r\n\r\n1806. _A Monkey Merchant._\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTE:\r\n\r\n[5] The advice offered in the concluding line of Daniel Lambert's\r\nadvertisement must, however, be followed with certain reserve. The\r\nLeicester giant's premature end is hardly an encouragement to would-be\r\nimitators. After his first visit to London, in 1806, Daniel Lambert\r\nreturned to his native place; the year following he repeated his visit,\r\nbut feeling oppressed by the atmosphere of the metropolis, he made\r\na tour through the principal provincial cities and towns, where he\r\nproved a great source of attraction. We are told 'his diet was plain,\r\nand the quantity moderate, and for many years he never drank anything\r\nstronger than water. His countenance was manly and intelligent; he\r\npossessed great information, much ready politeness, and conversed with\r\nease and facility. He had a powerful and melodious tenor voice, and his\r\narticulation was perfectly clear and unembarrassed.... Lambert had,\r\nhowever, for some time shown dropsical symptoms. In June, 1809, he was\r\nweighed at Huntingdon, and, by the Caledonian balance, was found to\r\nbe 52 stone 11 lb.; 10 stone 4 lb. heavier than Bright, the miller of\r\nMaiden, who only lived to the age of thirty.'\r\n\r\nA few days after this last weight was taken, on June 20, Lambert\r\narrived from Huntingdon at the Wagon and Horses Inn, St. Martin's,\r\nStamford, where preparations were made to receive company the next day\r\nand during the Stamford races. He was announced for exhibition; he\r\ngave his orders cheerfully, without any presentiment that they were\r\nto be his last. He was then in bed, only fatigued from his journey,\r\nbut anxious to see company early in the morning. Before nine o'clock,\r\nhowever, the day following, he was a corpse! He died in his apartment\r\non the ground-floor of the inn, for he had long been incapable of\r\nwalking up stairs. As may be supposed from his immense bulk and weight,\r\nhis interment was an arduous labour. His age was thirty-nine. At the\r\nWagon and Horses Inn were preserved two suits of Lambert's clothes;\r\nseven ordinary-sized men were repeatedly enclosed within his waistcoat,\r\nwithout breaking a stitch or straining a button.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1807.\r\n\r\n\r\n_February 1, 1807._ _Miseries of London.

The captain is mounted on a spirited charger; he is\r\nlosing his seat; several whips and his sabre have fallen, and the rider\r\nis holding on precariously by his horse's mane. Professor Gambado's\r\nfamous tract, _Hints to Bad Horsemen_, is thrown on the ground. The\r\nmembers of the troop, galloping in the rear, are enjoying their\r\nleader's mishap, and saying, 'Our young whip is not an old jockey.' The\r\ncaptain cries, 'March! trot! canter! charge! halt, halt, halt! I mean;'\r\nwhile candid confessions burst forth spontaneously from the trumpet at\r\nhis side. 'Avarice, vanity! oh what a ninny I was to throw myself off!\r\nthey're laughing at me!' while hypocrisy, ingratitude, double-dealing,\r\nfalse friendship, malice, &c., are trumpeted forth.\r\n\r\nIn the second plate the rider has come to grief; the horse is prancing\r\ngaily, relieved of his rider; the animal is addressing a parting remark\r\nto the discharged captain: 'You seem more frightened than hurt. You\r\nhave been taught the value of whips more than the use of them.'\r\n\r\nA hussar has recovered the trumpet; he stoops over to the fallen\r\ncaptain, who is rubbing the seat of his injuries: 'I hope your honour\r\nis not hurt,' to which the fallen leader replies, 'I am not hurt, upon\r\nmy honour!' The troopers are riding gaily on, exclaiming, 'Why, our\r\ncaptain needn't a fallen!'\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MISERIES OF LONDON.]\r\n\r\n_February 15, 1807._ _Miseries of Travelling; an Overloaded Coach._\r\nPublished by R.

Rowlandson, 1\r\nJames Street, Adelphi.--\r\n\r\n    To see them rattle, howl, and tear,\r\n    By Jove, 'twould make a parson swear,\r\n\r\nA subject of wanton destruction, which forms a fitting companion to\r\nthe invasion of the tulip-fancier's flower-beds by irrepressible\r\nbutterfly-collectors, was published the year following, as _The Enraged\r\nVicar_. In this case the horticultural tastes of the reverend gentleman\r\nhave led him to turn the grounds of the vicarage into a picture of\r\nthe most unvarying precision: clipped hedges, chopped borders of box,\r\nwith yew-trees and evergreens, carved into wonderful imitations of\r\nimpossible objects, form the passion of his heart. A hunted fox is\r\ndarting through these wonderful works of art; the hounds are breaking\r\nover everything, and the whole field of fox-hunters are riding through\r\nthe Vicar's boundaries, and pounding their horses over his cherished\r\nmonstrosities. Judging from the frantic state of the dignitary, the\r\nreverse of benedictions seem likely to be invoked upon the heads of the\r\nintruders, who are wrecking the results of any amount of misdirected\r\npatience 'in less than no time.'\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE ENRAGED VICAR.]\r\n\r\n_April 18, 1807._ _All the Talents._ Published by Stockdale, Pall Mall.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ALL THE TALENTS.]\r\n\r\n       Monstrum horrendum, informe, ingens, cui lumen ademptum.\r\n\r\nThe complex nature of the famous Broad-Bottom Administration, known\r\nas 'All the Talents,' is set forth in an allegorical representation,\r\nwhich is supposed to include the several qualifications of the vaunted\r\n_illuminés_. It may be remembered that this Ministry, which came into\r\npower under Liberal and popular auspices, retired on the rejection of\r\ntheir favourite measure, Catholic Emancipation, which they were pledged\r\nto introduce. The King, and his friends, the remnant of the Pittites,\r\nmade a desperate stand against this measure, and the consequence of its\r\ndefeat was the immediate withdrawal of 'All the Talents' from office.\r\nAs embodied by Rowlandson's pencil, the combination of heterogeneous\r\nelements produced a curious monster: the wig of a learned judge is worn\r\non the head of a spectacled ape, with an episcopal mitre and a Catholic\r\ncrosier; a lawyer's bands, a laced coat, and ragged breeches; wearing\r\none shoe, and a French jackboot; and dancing upon a funeral pyre of\r\npapers, the results of the Administration, its endless negotiations\r\nwith France, and its sinecures and patronages, which are blazing away.\r\nThe creature's right foot is discharging a musket, to represent the\r\n'Army,' which is producing certain mischief in the rear, and bringing\r\ntwo heavy folios, _Magna Charta_ and the _Coronation Oath_ upon the\r\nhead of the dangerous animal. The left hand, holding a pen upside-down,\r\nis supposed to be compounding new financial projects, in a ledger laid\r\nover a music book, 'Country dances,' an allusion to the alleged dancing\r\nproclivities of Lord Henry Petty, the Broad-Bottomite Chancellor of the\r\nExchequer.\r\n\r\nThe smoke, from the pipe of this _lusus Naturæ_, is obscuring the\r\nportrait of William Pitt. The end of 'All the Talents,' who sacrificed\r\ntheir influence from conscientious motives, and whose upright\r\nprinciples were beyond suspicion, was a great source of triumph to\r\ntheir opponents, who signalised their retirement with a volley of\r\nsatirical effusions. The 'Interment of the Broad-Bottomite Ministry'\r\nproduced a shower of political squibs and caricatures; and among the\r\nbest verses on the occasion, appeared the following mocking epitaph,\r\nwhich has been attributed to the gifted pen of Canning, who came into\r\noffice on the dismissal of 'All the Talents.'\r\n\r\n    When the Broad-Bottomed junto, all nonsense and strife,\r\n    Resigned, with a groan, its political life;\r\n    When converted to Rome, and of honesty tired,\r\n    It to Satan gave back what himself had inspired;\r\n\r\n    The Demon of Faction, that over them hung,\r\n    In accents of anguish their epitaph sung;\r\n    While Pride and Venality joined in the stave,\r\n    And canting Democracy wept on the grave.\r\n\r\n    Here lies, in the tomb that we hollowed for Pitt,\r\n    The conscience of Grenville, of Temple the wit;\r\n    Of Sidmouth the firmness, the temper of Grey,\r\n    And Treasurer Sheridan's promise to pay.\r\n\r\n    Here Petty's finance, from the evils to come,\r\n    With Fitzpatrick's sobriety creeps to the tomb;\r\n    And Chancellor Ego, now left in the lurch,\r\n    Neither laughs at the law nor cuts jokes at the Church.\r\n\r\n    Then huzza for the party that here's laid to rest--\r\n    'All the Talents,' but self-praising blockheads at best:\r\n    Though they sleep in oblivion, they've died with the hope,\r\n    At the last day of freedom, to rise with the Pope.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A NINCOMPOOP, OR HEN-PECKED HUSBAND.]\r\n\r\n_April 24, 1807._ _A Nincompoop, or Hen-peck'd Husband._ Published by\r\nT.

A buxom city wife is sailing along with an air like a tragedy\r\nqueen, fanning herself as she walks. Her better half, a miserable\r\nbeing reduced to abject servitude, is bearing a bundle, a shawl, a\r\npair of pattens, and an umbrella, objects to serve in the train of his\r\nmistress's grandeur; the poor 'nincompoop' is vainly turning his eyes\r\nup Heavenwards: no miracle is vouchsafed to free him from his bondage.\r\nOther stout promenaders are bursting with indignation at the weakness\r\nof this lord of creation, while they walk in the other extreme, and\r\nleave their better halves to drag along both children and baggage in\r\ntheir wake. Certain tired pedestrians are enjoying the reward of their\r\nexertions, while partaking of cool pipes and tankards, at the '_Old\r\nSwan Inn, Ordinary on Sundays_,' whither the parties have evidently\r\nproceeded to dine.\r\n\r\n_April 26, 1807._ _John Rosedale, Mariner._ _Exhibitor at the Hall of\r\nGreenwich Hospital._ Etched and published by T.

A powdered,\r\npig-tailed, and lace-ruffled dandy has sought concealment amidst the\r\nsacks of grain; his head appears over the barrier in sheer dismay,\r\nfor a determined farm help, probably the legitimate swain of the\r\nindignant damsel, armed with a formidable pitchfork, is making reckless\r\nefforts to impale the trespasser; his fury is slightly restrained by\r\nthe stalwart exertions of the lady, who has buried her fingers in the\r\nvillage Othello's shock head of hair; at his feet is a scroll with the\r\nquotation 'I smell a rat, dead for a ducat.' A bill, pinned on the\r\nwall, sets forth 'Rats, pole cats, and all sorts of vermin effectively\r\ndestroyed.'\r\n\r\n_May 17, 1807._ _The Old Man of the Sea, sticking to the Shoulders\r\nof Sindbad the Sailor._ Vide _The Arabian Nights Entertainments_.\r\nPublished by T.

In the distance is shown the baronet's\r\nmansion, _Independence and a comfortable home_. From an upper window a\r\nlady is waving back the traveller, who does not relish turning his back\r\non this prospect to encounter the _Ministerial Shoals_ and _Treasury\r\nRocks_ which are opposed to his progress on the other side. Horne Tooke\r\nis urging on the career of his _protégé_: 'Persevere! persevere! you\r\nare the only man to get through.' Burdett's confidence is wavering:\r\n'This old man will be the end of me at last; what a miry place he has\r\nbrought me into!'\r\n\r\n_May 25, 1807._ _A White Sergeant giving the Word of Command: 'Why\r\ndon't you come to bed, you drunken sot?'_ Published by R.

When his body was recovered from the\r\nriver an inquest was duly held to determine the cause of his end,\r\nduring which the subject of the deliberation revived, and appeared as a\r\nwitness; but his testimony being declined, on the ground of his recent\r\ndecease, the jury appealed to the doctor, who swore that, as Delaney\r\nwas 'something alive,' it 'must be his ghost. So they sent out of hand\r\nfor the clergy to lay him, but Pat laid the clergy, and then ran away.'\r\n\r\n_June 18, 1807._ _A View on the Banks of the Thames._ (No. 177.)\r\nPublished by T. Tegg.

'There\r\nye are, my bonny lads, mak the best o' your way, the door is open,\r\nand leave a Scotsman alaine to stick in a place gin he once gains an\r\nentrance.'

In the picture the quack has just\r\nadministered his _Pillula Memoria_ and _Anti Fibbibus_; the incautious\r\nwould-be waggish student is very uncomfortable, and declares he has\r\ntaken _Asafoetida_. 'You speak the truth,' says the doctor, 'you are\r\nperfectly cured; and as to your memory, that cure follows of course,\r\nfor I am sure you will never forget the medicine!'\r\n\r\n_July 10, 1807._ _The Double Disaster, or New Cure for Love._\r\nRowlandson del. et sculp. Published by T. Tegg, 111 Cheapside.--This\r\nsketch, which is characterised by the artist's usual spirit when\r\ndealing with kindred subjects, represents the situation of a rustic\r\nswain, whose philanderings have landed him in the midst of the\r\nperplexities of a double dilemma. It is seemingly 'washing day,' and\r\nthe gallant intruder has effected his admission to court the graces\r\nof a pretty maiden, who is thrown into consternation at the risk to\r\nwhich her suitor, by an awkward _contretemps_, is suddenly exposed. The\r\npair have evidently been disturbed at the moment the lady was engaged\r\nin drawing a mug of ale for the refreshment of her admirer; in the\r\nconfusion, the tap of the beer barrel is still left running, and all\r\nthe maid's solicitude is centred in the position of her swain, who has\r\nincautiously taken refuge in the copper. A very disagreeable-looking\r\nold beldame is kindling a blazing fire in the stove, while a buxom\r\nwench is working away at the pump, which is pouring gallons of water\r\ninto the unlucky Lothario's place of concealment. The youth is\r\nhesitating midway between the ordeals of fire or water, and he is\r\nstruggling to effect his escape from both, at the risk of exposure and\r\nits consequences.\r\n\r\n_July 14, 1807._ _Easter Hunt._ _Clearing a Fence._ (_Easter Monday, or\r\nthe Cockney Hunt._)\r\n\r\n1807. _Miseries of the Country._ 'While on a visit to the hundreds of\r\nEssex, being under the necessity of getting dead drunk every day to\r\nsave your life.'\r\n\r\n              Et propter vitam vivendi perdere causas....\r\n\r\nThe hundreds of Essex, it appears from the print, which represents a\r\nbacchanalian sporting revel, were doubtless attractive to fox-hunters;\r\nbut the hospitalities exercised therein were rather excessive. The\r\nusual accompaniments of a drunken bout of the period are set forth\r\nwith Rowlandson's graphic skill; an old toper is draining a punch-bowl\r\nand capsizing himself simultaneously; an ambitious young reveller is\r\ntipsily trying to mount the table, and over-balancing himself in the\r\nattempt; a stout divine is indisposed in a corner; heavy drinkers laid\r\nlow are on the floor, whence they are dragged off by their heels, and\r\ncarried to bed in an incapable and collapsed condition. Furniture is\r\nknocked over, and chimney ornaments sent to grief. It is an anniversary\r\nmeeting of choice spirits.\r\n\r\n_October 5, 1807._ _A Mistake at Newmarket, or Sport and Piety._\r\nWoodward del., Rowlandson sculp. Published by T.

'Pray, young man,' she enquires of a smart young\r\njockey, 'are there any _meetings_ in this town?' To which the jockey\r\nreplies, 'Yes, ma'am, two a year--Spring and October!'\r\n\r\n1807(?) _Englishman at Paris._ H. Bunbury invt., Rowlandson sculp.--Our\r\nold friend John Bull is shown, with his travelling accompaniments,\r\nphilosophically pursuing his quiet way in the land of the 'Monsieurs.'\r\nHe is the centre of curiosity, though, according to the artist's\r\npicture, he is the least remarkable object in the group. A corpulent\r\nfriar is observing the well-rounded person of the stranger with an\r\nappreciative eye; while a lean cook, in wooden shoes, is staring with\r\nastonishment at the goodly proportions of the Englishman. A French\r\n_petit-maître_ is driving a ramshackle contrivance, and his queerly\r\nclad servant is perched on the springs behind. A female luggage porter\r\nis plodding along, and an adventitious shower, directed from a balcony\r\nabove, is descending on the umbrella of a dandified pedestrian,\r\ndaintily mincing along on tiptoe, who, at first glance, might be taken\r\nfor a live Marquis, if, on inspection, his apron and the professional\r\nimplements peeping out of his coat-tail, did not proclaim him a barber.\r\nJohn Bull's substantially built dog is eyeing a sniffing French hound\r\nwith threatening suspicion.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ENGLISHMAN AT PARIS.]\r\n\r\n1807(?) _Symptoms of Restiveness._ H. Bunbury del., Rowlandson\r\nsculp.--Henry Bunbury, it will be observed, was remarkably fond of\r\ndrawing disasters in the saddle; his brother, the respected Sir Charles\r\nBunbury, was, for many years, president of the Jockey Club, in which\r\ndifficult position he rigorously upheld the integrity of the turf; and\r\nthere is no doubt that the originator of 'Geoffrey Gambado, Esq.,' and\r\nof those invaluable precepts on equitation published and illustrated as\r\nalleged by the eminent _Riding Master of the Horse and Grand Equerry\r\nto the Doge of Venice_ (about the only potentate who could not find\r\na turnpike-road within his capital), must have had 'a good eye for a\r\nhorse.'\r\n\r\nThe Symptoms of Restiveness are of a somewhat marked and unmistakable\r\ncharacter: while one sportsman's steed is kneeling down on his\r\nforelegs, and turning the huntsman heels over head, another cavalier's\r\nanimal is standing rigidly on his forelegs, and perseveringly\r\nattempting to dislodge his mount by kicking out wildly behind. A\r\nthird rider is no less fortunate in his hack, which has 'no mouth,'\r\nand is moreover a 'bolter'; the animal is steadily plunging through\r\neverything in its way, apparently unconscious of the desperate efforts\r\nhis master is making to hold him in. An old woman, with her barrow\r\nand its contents, are tumbled over, without attracting the attention\r\nof the wrong-headed brute, whose mind is absorbed in his own private\r\nspeculations.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SYMPTOMS OF RESTIVENESS.]\r\n\r\n1807 (?) _A Calf's Pluck._ Designed by H.

As it appears that this gentleman is inclined to be\r\nless respectable than his venerated calling should suggest, it is\r\nless scandalising to observe that various practical jokes of a rough\r\ncharacter are besetting his path; consequently, it is highly probable\r\nthat he will receive an active moral lesson before he reaches his\r\nchamber.\r\n\r\n_November 9, 1807._ _Thomas Simmons, drawn from Life by Mr. Angelo._\r\nPublished by T. Rowlandson, 1 James Street, Adelphi. 'The horrid and\r\ninhuman murderer of Mrs. Hammerstone and Mrs. Warner at the house of\r\nMr. Boreham, a Quaker at Hoddesdon, in Herts, on Tuesday evening,\r\nOctober 20, 1807.'--The barbarous murderer does not rejoice in a\r\nvery formidable exterior. His weakly person has been sketched by the\r\nhand of Henry Angelo, the well-known fencing-master, a firm friend\r\nof Rowlandson through life. His amusing _Memoirs_ have supplied us\r\nwith many circumstances relating to the caricaturist. It appears that\r\nAngelo, Bannister, and Rowlandson were schoolfellows at an early period\r\nof life, and they were all as youths excessively fond of their pencils;\r\nalthough it was reserved for Rowlandson alone to attain proficiency in\r\nthe fine arts. Angelo, like George Selwyn, Colonel Hanger, and some\r\nfew notorieties, was fond of attending executions, visiting jails,\r\nand similar lugubrious exhibitions. Among his visits to prisons he\r\nencountered some curious characters. Thomas Simmons, the subject of\r\nthe present plate, was one of the unfortunates with whom he became\r\nacquainted on one of these eccentric excursions.\r\n\r\nFrom the sketch, Thomas Simmons appears a mere dwarf of a man, a\r\nharmless-looking and apparently half-witted individual, realising the\r\ntraditional idea of _Simple Simon_. This murderer has heavy manacles\r\nround his puny limbs. Groups of miserable prisoners, and hard-featured\r\njailors are in the rear, and the heavy iron doors of Newgate afford an\r\nappropriate background.\r\n\r\n_November 10, 1807._ _Directions to Footmen._ Rowlandson del. Published\r\nby T. Tegg, 111 Cheapside (273).--'Take off the largest dishes, and\r\nset them on with one hand, to show the ladies your vigour and strength\r\nof back, but always do it between two ladies, that if the dish happens\r\nto slip, the soup or sauce may fall on their clothes, and not daub the\r\nfloor; by this practice, two of our brethren, my worthy friends, got\r\nconsiderable fortunes.'--A stalwart awkward-looking yokel, in a showy\r\nlivery, is carrying out these useful directions to the letter. While\r\ngrinning at his horrified mistress, he is upsetting a tureen held\r\nloosely in his right hand, over a handsome damsel, and is flooding the\r\ntable-cloth, to the horror of the company, and the delight of a poodle,\r\nwhich is revelling in the stream. In the clumsy footman's left hand is\r\nheld a dish, from which he is calmly allowing the joint, gravy, &c.,\r\nto glide over the back of another dog who is less pleased than his\r\ncompanion.\r\n\r\n_November 10, 1807._ _John Bull making Observations on the Coast._\r\nWoodward del., Rowlandson sculp.

The empiric wears his learned robes and fur\r\ncap; in the centre of a magic circle stands the pretended enchanter's\r\nassistant, dressed in a bullock's hide, with the horns and tail left\r\non, to personate the Father of Evil; a butcher, in his working dress,\r\nhas called to consult the oracle concerning a missing sheep; he has\r\nbrought his bull-dog with him, unobserved by the demonstrator, and\r\nthe animal, true to his instincts, has pinned the mock demon-bull by\r\nthe nose; 'the pretended devil roar'd most tremendously; but the dog\r\nkept a firm hold. The conjurer, rising in a passion, exclaimed, \"You\r\nscoundrel, take off your dog!\" The butcher, however, perceiving the\r\ncheat, cried out, \"Not I, doctor, I know he is of as good a breed as\r\never bolted, so let 'em fight fair; if you are not afraid of your\r\ndevil, I am not afraid of my dog; so dog against devil for what sum you\r\nplease!\"' The fictitious demon is in bad case.\r\n\r\n1807 (?). _More Miseries, or the Bottom of Mr. Figg's Old Whiskey\r\nbroke through._--A serio-comic scene that befel the 'grocer's wife at\r\nNorwich, owing to the bottom of Mr. Figg's whiskey breaking through.'\r\nThe flooring of a vehicle something like a phaeton has proved too\r\nslight for a ponderous occupant: the lady's ample proportions are\r\nframed in the chaise, to the alarm of her husband, who is seizing the\r\nprancing horse.

These were the individuals who formed that celebrated\r\nfamily of painters. The father of Ludovico Caracci was a butcher\r\n(_era macelago_), and the father of Annibale and Augustino a tailor.\r\nAnnibale resolved to mortify the pride of Ludovico, who despised him\r\non account of his frequently reminding him of their low origin. He\r\ntherefore privately painted the portraits of the Caracci, as large as\r\nlife, in a butcher's shop, and showed his picture for the first time to\r\nLudovico, when in company with Cardinal Farnese. It is now in the Guise\r\ncollection, at Christ Church College, Oxford. Annibale is the butcher\r\nweighing the meat, which a soldier (Ludovico) is purchasing. Augustino\r\nstands near them. Antonio is lifting down a carcase, which conceals his\r\ndeformity; and the old woman represents their mother. General Guise is\r\nsaid to have given 1,100_l._ for this picture, which was purchased for\r\nhim at Venice. Talking of Oxford, did you ever see this collection? If\r\nthe old General Guise had no more taste for fighting than for painting,\r\nI would have met him and his legions with wooden cannon. Yet I have\r\nheard certain _bigwigs_ of the University crack up the Guise Gallery!\r\nThey are nice social fellows at Christ Church for all this, and men of\r\ntaste; a conversation on painting is brought to table in hall there,\r\nlike the wine--devilishly well iced.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1808.\r\n\r\nSOCIAL AND GENERAL CARICATURES.\r\n\r\n\r\n_January, 1808._ _The Discovery._\r\n\r\n_January, 1808._ _Wild Irish, or Paddy from Cork with his Coat Buttoned\r\nBehind._\r\n\r\n_February 16, 1808._ _Scenes at Brighton, or the Miseries of Human\r\nLife._\r\n\r\n_Plate 3._ 'A Blackleg detected secreting cards &c., after drawing upon\r\nyour purse on former occasions, is the properest of men to run the\r\ngauntlet, as he but too often produces substantial Miseries for Human\r\nLife.'\r\n\r\n_Plate 4._ 'Suffering under the last symptoms of a dangerous malady,\r\nyou naturally hope relief from medical skill and practice; but flying\r\nperiwigs, brandished canes, and clysters, the fear of random cuffs,\r\n&c., intrude and produce a climax in the Miseries of Human Life.'\r\n\r\n_March 1, 1808._ _Miseries of High Life._--'Briskly stooping to pick\r\nup a lady's fan, at the same moment when two other gentlemen are doing\r\nthe same thing, and so making a cannon with your head against both of\r\ntheirs, and this without being the happy man after all.'\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MISERIES OF HIGH LIFE.]\r\n\r\n_March 1, 1808._ _The Green Dragon._ Rowlandson del. Published by R.\r\nAckermann, 101 Strand.--A clerical-looking and corpulent reprobate is\r\nreceiving the upbraidings of his infuriated spouse, to whom the artist\r\nhas playfully given some resemblance to a veritable dragon, with teeth,\r\nclaws, and venom. The position of affairs is further explained by a\r\nspirited representation of 'Socrates and Zantippe,' which hangs on\r\nthe wall. A pretty servant-maid, who is making a somewhat hasty exit,\r\nis supposed to have aroused the jealousy of the virago, whose vials\r\nof wrath have brought her stout helpmate to a state of stupefaction\r\nand terror. The picture is accompanied by the lines of Gay, from the\r\n_Beggars' Opera_:--\r\n\r\n    With rage I redden like scarlet, that my dear inconstant varlet,\r\n    Stark blind to my charms, is lost in the arms of that jilt,\r\n        that inveigling harlot!\r\n\r\n_March 1, 1808._ _Description of a Boxing Match._ June 9, 1806.\r\nPublished by T.

Rowlandson, 1 James\r\nStreet, Adelphi.--The progress of the regiment is much impeded by\r\ncamp-followers. A stream happening to cross the route, the marching\r\nparty are wading through; the soldiers bearing in addition to their\r\nknapsack the fairer burden of a wife, and in some cases two infants,\r\nwith kettles, gridirons, and other culinary appliances, the latter\r\nswinging on the end of their muskets. The officer commanding the party\r\nhas the advantage of securing a mount on the plump shoulders of a\r\npretty damsel, whose skirts are tucked up as a preparation towards\r\nwading across the water, with the feathered hero on her back.\r\n\r\n_May 12, 1808._ _The Consultation, or Last Hope._ Published by R.\r\nAckermann, 101 Strand.--'So when the Doctors shake their heads, and bid\r\ntheir patient think of Heaven--all's over, good night!'\r\n\r\nFrom the picture, which rejoices in this comforting quotation, we judge\r\nthe unfortunate invalid, introduced by the artist as the principal\r\nfigure in this humorous plate, is in a bad case; his suffering face\r\nexpresses all the forlorn terrors of his extreme situation, which seems\r\ntolerably hopeless, since he is attended by no less than ten learned\r\npractitioners, and a sick-nurse; it is hard if among them they cannot\r\nsettle their patient's condition. The ten are by no means troubling\r\nthemselves about their client all at once: it is sufficient that a\r\nbrace of the brethren are feeling each a pulse, which operation does\r\nnot seem to afford them much enlightenment, since one is consulting\r\nhis chronometer, and the other is seeking inspiration from the head\r\nof his gold-topped stick. Their colleagues are more agreeably engaged\r\nin fortifying themselves for their arduous professional duties by\r\nattending manfully to the refreshment department. The gouty patient\r\nhas evidently been a man of substance; over his mantel hangs a map of\r\n'Rotten Boroughs,--Camelford, Devon, &c.'\r\n\r\n_May 21, 1808._ _Volunteer Wit, or not Enough for a Prime._ Woodward\r\ndel., Rowlandson sculp. Published by T.

A challenge is given from the\r\nchair: 'Come, gentlemen-volunteers, to the right and left--Charge if\r\nyou please to the King!' The vice-chair is winning the sympathies of\r\nthe rest, and extracting a grin all round, by standing up, spectacles\r\non nose, and responding: 'I should be very happy to obey your orders,\r\nColonel, but really your glasses are so small, that, dash me if there's\r\nenough for a prime!' The Colonel's miserly disposition is hinted by the\r\nvarious papers thrown about, on the 'Current prices of Port wine,' and\r\nsuch maxims as 'A penny saved is twopence got'; with a statement pinned\r\nto the wall, 'How to get rich,' 'Pinch, squeeze, gripe, snatch, &c.'\r\n\r\n1808 (?). _The Anatomy of Melancholy._ ''Tis a misery to be born,\r\na pain to live, a trouble to die.'--A mixed scene of suffering and\r\nindifference. Propped up in a pillowed arm-chair, before the fire, is\r\na melancholy invalid, old, decrepit, and ill-favoured. By his side is\r\na list of 'Remedies against discontents,' 'Cure of jealousy,' &c.; on\r\nthe mantel is an array of doctor's bottles, and a hatchment,--_groans,\r\ngriefs, sadness_,--forms a cheerful adornment for the chimneypiece.\r\n\r\nBehind the sufferer, whose last hour, it seems, is approaching--since\r\nDeath has thrust his head, arm, and hour-glass through a window above\r\nhis head--is seated a blooming young damsel, decked out in all the\r\nattractiveness of an evening toilette; planted at a table by her\r\nside is a dandified admirer; before them a dessert is arranged, and\r\ndecanters of wine are ready to hand. The nonchalant pair are pledging\r\none another amorously in bumpers, while the spirit of the founder of\r\nthe feast is departing. A painting of Democritus, his face wearing an\r\nexpression of grief on one side, and laughter on the other, explains\r\nthe transitory nature of sorrow, and the key of the situation is\r\nfurther offered by certain lines inscribed on a paper under the lady's\r\nhand: 'Come what may, the cat will mew, the dog will have his day.'\r\n\r\n_May 21, 1808._ _The Mother's Hope._ Woodward del., Rowlandson sculp.\r\nPublished by T.

The\r\nyoung rebel is dancing about in a fine rage, scattering his playthings,\r\nand 'making a bobbery' which is setting the entire house by the ears.\r\nThe screams of the intractable elder are imitated by an infant in arms,\r\nand a canary is adding its shrill pipings to the general squall, after\r\nthe nature of little warblers.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE MOTHER'S HOPE.]\r\n\r\nThe wilful child is making a general statement of refractory\r\nresolutions:--'I don't like dolls--I don't like canary birds--I hate\r\nbattledore and shuttlecock--I like drums and trumpets--I won't go to\r\nschool--I will stay at home--I will have my own way in everything!'\r\nThe horrified grandmother is growing prophetic on the strength of this\r\nirreconcilable prodigy: 'Bless the Baby--what an aspiring spirit--if he\r\ngoes on in this way he will be a second Buonaparte!'\r\n\r\n_June 4, 1808._ _The Sweet Little Girl that I Love._ Woodward del.,\r\nRowlandson sculp.

The\r\npicture is designed as a parody upon the lines:--\r\n\r\n    My friends all declare that my time is misspent,\r\n      While in rural contentment I rove:\r\n    I ask no more wealth than Dame Fortune has sent,\r\n      And the sweet little girl that I love.\r\n    The rose on her cheek's my delight:\r\n    She's soft as the down--the down of the dove.\r\n      No lily was ever so fair\r\n    As the sweet little girl that I love.\r\n\r\n_June 4, 1808._ _Odd Fellows from Downing Street, complaining to John\r\nBull._ Woodward del., Rowlandson sculp. Published by T. Tegg, 111\r\nCheapside (168).--John Bull, in his best clothes, and standing in\r\nthe vicinity of the Treasury, is receiving a deputation, the members\r\nof which, as far as appearance goes, are singularly fitted for the\r\norder of Odd-fellows. The object of their interview is simply an\r\nappeal to the sympathies of the National Prototype: 'You must know,\r\nMr. Bull, we are a society of Odd Fellows who had a Lodge in Downing\r\nStreet, and were robb'd of our cash and accounts, notwithstanding we\r\nmet at the King's Head, and so near the Treasury too! Is not it very\r\nhard? However, we have left Downing Street entirely.' John Bull, who,\r\nwith his hand beneath his coat-tails, is ruminating over other more\r\nweighty matters applying to his own case, and peering through his huge\r\nspectacles, returns in reply: 'All I have to say, my good friends, is\r\nthis--I am very sorry for you, but I must own I am of opinion if some\r\nmore _Odd Fellows_ in Downing Street were to quit their situations it\r\nwould be very much to my advantage!'\r\n\r\n_June 20, 1808._ _A Snug Cabin, or Port Admiral._ Published by R.\r\nAckermann, 101 Strand.--Very different cheer to the _Volunteer Prime_,\r\nis found on board the ship of the port-admiral. That worthy personage\r\nis drawn entertaining his naval colleagues, admirals, commodores,\r\nand captains, in his state cabin, with the best of cheer; baskets of\r\nprime vintage from the Isles of the Madeira, are ready to the nimble\r\nsteward's hand, and the goodly flasks are uncorked in a twinkling.\r\nThe jorums on the mahogany are capacious, and the glasses, which are\r\nfreely emptied, would serve as goblets for more than half-pint bumpers;\r\nhowever, in spite of the hilarity, and the liberal circulation of\r\nthe decanters, decorum is preserved, and the naval commanders are\r\ncomporting themselves like 'fine old English gentlemen,' while the\r\ntoast goes round:--\r\n\r\n    Come Hurricane,\r\n    Drink your Wine.\r\n    Here's to the wind that blows,\r\n    The ship that goes,\r\n    And the lass that loves a sailor.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A SNUG CABIN, OR PORT ADMIRAL.]\r\n\r\n_June 30, 1808._ _Accommodation, or Lodgings to Let at Portsmouth._\r\nPublished by T. Tegg. (219.)--Certain smartly-rigged tars have\r\njust come on shore, evidently after a handsome haul in the way of\r\nprize-money, as the spruceness of their turn-out evinces. A highly\r\npresentable 'salt' has his wife in tow; the lady has evidently taken a\r\nshare of his good fortune, being dressed in the height of the fashion,\r\nwith ear-rings, necklets, and chains, heavy enough for cables, to\r\nwhich are suspended miniatures, seals, and watches. The happy pair are\r\nevidently about to set up housekeeping, and an advertisement-board has\r\njust arrested their attention, conveying the information, 'Lodgings for\r\nSingle Men and their Wives,' with an invitation to ring the bell. 'Why,\r\nNan,' exclaims the tar to his partner, 'this is the very berth we have\r\nbeen so long looking after!'\r\n\r\n_June 30, 1808._ _The Welsh Sailor's Mistake, or Tars in Conversation._\r\nWoodward del., Rowlandson sculp.

Groups of sailors are seated on\r\nthe forecastle, some perched on coils of rope, others on sea chests;\r\na British tar, on a barrel, with a canister of 'real Oronooko' by\r\nhis side, is spinning a yarn to his messmates; he has arrived at the\r\nexciting incident of his narrative:--'and so then, do you see, David,\r\nwe sprung a leak!' when his Welsh messmate, who cannot resist this\r\nallusion to a reputed national delicacy, rather irrationally interrupts\r\nhim: 'Cot pless us--and save us--did you? and a ferry coot fetchitable\r\nit is; I should have liked to have had a pit with you.'\r\n\r\n_October 25, 1808._ _A Bill of Fare for Bond Street Epicures._ Woodward\r\ndel., engraved by T.

The comforting assurance given by the practitioner\r\nto his patients is, it appears, totally without foundation; all\r\nhis clients, judging from their condition, being in a fair way to\r\nsupplement the Bills of Mortality.\r\n\r\n_November 1, 1808._ _The Last Shift._ Published by Reeve and Jones, 7\r\nVere Street.--Interior of a pawnbroker's shop; two St. Giles's demireps\r\nare shown in the act of raising a loan to replenish their gin bottle,\r\nat the expense of their wardrobe.\r\n\r\n_November 1, 1808._ _Breaking Cover._ Published by Reeve and Jones, 7\r\nVere Street.--A fox-hunting party is passing through a village; one of\r\nthe Nimrods has seemingly formed an attachment for a fair neighbour:\r\nstanding on the back and saddle of his horse, he has contrived to raise\r\nhimself to the level of the lady's casement, and she is leaning out of\r\nwindow, and rewarding his gallantry with a tender embrace; meanwhile\r\nher husband in his nightcap, opening the shutter below, is securing a\r\nprospect of the proceeding, which has thrown an expression of idiotic\r\nconsternation over his simple features.\r\n\r\n_November 1, 1808._ _Get Money._--One of a series engraved in rough\r\nfacsimile of Rowlandson's original drawings, and bearing an imitation\r\nof his autograph in the corner; published by Reeve and Jones, 7 Vere\r\nStreet.\r\n\r\nBelow the print appear the following lines:--\r\n\r\n    Get Money, Money still,\r\n    And then let Virtue follow if she will.\r\n\r\nThree conventional types of Israelites are indicated standing in Duke's\r\nPlace, the resort of Jewish clothesmen, eagerly canvassing the above\r\ndoctrine, and carrying out its first injunction.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DOCTOR GALLIPOT.]\r\n\r\n_November 1, 1808._ _Doctor Gallipot placing his Fortune at the feet of\r\nhis Mistress._ Published by Reeve and Jones, 7 Vere Street.\r\n\r\n                       Throw physic to the dogs.\r\n\r\nDoctor Gallipot, a brandy-faced empiric, who is dressed in the height\r\nof the 'Frenchified' fashion, the better to support his quackeries, is\r\nlaying the implements of his profession, as his fortune, at the feet\r\nof a slightly theatrical looking lady, whose figure is delineated with\r\nRowlandson's accustomed grace and spirit.\r\n\r\n_November 1, 1808._ _Rum Characters in a Shrubbery._ Published by Reeve\r\nand Jones, 7 Vere Street.--Four demireps, of dissipated appearance and\r\nvaried characteristics, are regaling themselves on Booth's gin at a\r\npublic bar or _Rum Shrubbery_.\r\n\r\n_About 1808._ _Bartholomew's Fair._ Nixon del., Rowlandson sculp.--The\r\nfun of the Fair is represented in full swing, and the humours of the\r\nscenes displayed on all sides are seized and hit off with the usual\r\nfelicity of both artists. Judging from the caricature, the abolition of\r\nfairs in the City must have been a boon to public order and morality.\r\nThe noise, disorder, and misrule of the festivity are taking place\r\noutside the hospital. Boat-swings are revolving, a few of the swings\r\nare getting into difficulties, upsetting, or the bottoms coming out,\r\nwhile some of the swingers find themselves indisposed from the motion.\r\nThere are wandering sellers of sweets, pastry, and such things as were\r\ndevoured at _fairings_, boys with links, for it is late, and dusk;\r\nbooths for refreshments, where customers are eating hot cakes cooked\r\non the spot. There are drinking stalls where tipplers are taking too\r\nmuch; as is illustrated in the person of a reveller who, finding\r\nhimself overcome with liquor, has laid down in the gutter to take a\r\nlittle rest, an opportunity not lost sight of by the light-fingered\r\ngentry who have come for business; the toper's watch, purse, hat, and\r\nother portable property are swiftly transferred. There are booths for\r\ndancing, and there are merrymakers who are managing to dance outside;\r\nthere are revolving wheel-swings and merry-go-rounds; there is a crowd\r\nof very miscellaneous merry-making company, and parties of jolly\r\nsailors arriving outside coaches. The harmony of the proceedings is\r\nvaried by several rows; and, in more than one spot, rings are formed\r\nfor fair fighting, and both men and women are exhibiting their prowess\r\nin the boxing line, or exchanging buffets and scratches. The signs\r\nand booths of famous showmen, once the splendours of by-gone fairs,\r\nare disposed around; among the spectacles which invited those of our\r\nforefathers who 'went to see the shows,' we may notice that Rowlandson\r\nhas introduced Miles' Menagerie, Saunder's Tragic Theatre, Gingle's\r\nGrand Medley, Miss Biffin, Polito's Grand Collection, Punch, &c.\r\n\r\n\r\nROWLANDSON'S CARICATURES AGAINST BUONAPARTE.\r\n\r\nAs we have already seen, Rowlandson's pencil and graver were enlisted\r\nagainst the Corsican; it would seem that the artist's anti-Napoleonic\r\nproclivities ran strongly from this period until the downfall of the\r\nEmperor; or else--which is the more reasonable solution--English\r\nprejudices against the man whose almost frantic antagonism to this\r\ncountry is now forgiven, if not well-nigh forgotten, demanded an\r\nunlimited supply of pictorial satires to stimulate the national hatred,\r\na state of things which pleased both the publishers and the public,\r\nand kept the caricaturist occupied, although it is to be regretted that\r\nthese somewhat imaginative scenes of horror employed his ready skill\r\nto the exclusion of those representations of social manners, and the\r\nobservances of the world around him, whose eccentricities he might have\r\nsketched from the life--scenes drawn from a quaint and picturesque\r\ngeneration of which his earlier career has left us such lively\r\npictures, works which alone render his name worthy of his reputation,\r\nand which form in themselves an inexhaustible and valuable legacy to\r\nhis followers.\r\n\r\n_July 8, 1808._ _The Corsican Tiger at Bay._ Published by R. Ackermann,\r\n101 Strand.--The mighty disturber of the peace of Europe is figured\r\nunder the form of a savage tiger, with his natural head, and on which\r\nhe wears the enormous military cocked hat with its long plume--most\r\nindispensable accessories in all the caricaturist's portraits of the\r\ngreat 'little Corsican.' The tiger's claws are rending four 'Royal\r\nGreyhounds,' which are quite at the mercy of the ferocious conqueror;\r\nbut a larger and stronger pack of 'Patriotic Greyhounds' are giving\r\ntongue, and a fierce charge is being made by some very determined\r\nand mischievous-looking hounds who are rushing up to the attack. The\r\n_Dutch Frog_, isolated on his own little mudheap, is promising to\r\njoin the fray: 'It will be my turn to have a slap at him next.' The\r\n_Russian Bear_ and the _Austrian Eagle_, are kept in secure bondage by\r\nheavy fetters, but the triple-headed bird of prey is looking forward\r\nto a fresh onslaught, and prompting his fellow-captive: 'Now _Brother\r\nBruin_, is the time to break our chains.'\r\n\r\nJohn Bull, on his own island shores, has come out in the character of a\r\nsportsman; he is pointing his piece at the tiger brought to bay, and is\r\nsinging nursery rhymes for the general encouragement:--\r\n\r\n                        There was a little man,\r\n                       And he had a little gun,\r\n                  And his bullets were made of lead:\r\n               D--- me, but we'll manage him amongst us!\r\n\r\n_July 10, 1808._ _Billingsgate at Bayonne, or the Imperial Dinner._\r\nPublished by R. Ackermann, 101 Strand.--The members of the Royal\r\nfamily of Spain, decoyed to Bayonne, are sitting down to a very\r\nunruly repast, the entire company being at loggerheads. The Queen\r\nhas risen from table, and in true fishfag style she is raving at her\r\nson Ferdinand, who is confronting her: 'Now, you villain, I'll tell\r\nyou to your face--and before my dear friend Boney--you are no child\r\nof the King's--so you may shut up.' At this famous interview the\r\nOueen of Spain, it may be remembered, after upbraiding Ferdinand for\r\nhis usurpation, actually declared him illegitimate. This argument,\r\naccording to the print, does not demolish her opponent, who is\r\nreplying: 'Madam, I know all your tricks, and all the tricks of your\r\nPrince of Peace.' The Infants of Spain are encouraging the last\r\nspeaker: 'Brother, don't mind her, we, the Infants, acknowledge you;'\r\na terrific personage, with the emblem of a Royal crown on the back\r\nof his seat, is banging down his fist and demanding: 'Am not I the\r\ngreat Zavallos? will you be silent?' Those on the opposite side are\r\nmore tranquilly disposed; Charles, who had abdicated by Buonaparte's\r\ncompulsion in favour of his son Ferdinand, is crying: 'I wish they\r\nwould let a poor old King play quietly on his fiddle!' while one of\r\nthe diners is actually paying attention to his meal, and wishing\r\n'they would leave him at peace.' Little Buonaparte in the uniform of\r\na general, as he is usually represented, has risen from a high-raised\r\nthrone, erected in accordance with his imperial state, at the head of\r\nthe table; he is affecting to be in a passion at the general discord\r\nwhich he had ingeniously contrived to foster and bring about: 'I'll\r\ntell you what, if you make such a riot at my table, I'll be d----d if I\r\ndon't send you to the Round House!'\r\n\r\n_July 12, 1808._ _The Corsican Spider in his Web._ Woodward del.,\r\nRowlandson sculp. Published by T. Tegg, 111 Cheapside.--The formidable\r\nEmperor is represented in a highly successful character as an overgrown\r\nspider; his body is formed of 'unbounded Ambition,' which is topped\r\nwith his own head, he enjoys an amazing capacity for swallowing the\r\nsurrounding insects, which seem unable to resist being drawn into his\r\ntoils. The voracious Corsican Spider in the centre of his wide-spread\r\nweb, is swallowing down a brace of _Spanish Flies_. 'Small Flies\r\nInnumerable' are entrapped in strings, and even the largest specimens\r\nseem powerless to disentangle themselves; the Austrian, Dutch,\r\nPortuguese, Hanoverian, Etrurian, Prussian, Hamburg, Italian, and\r\nVenetian Flies are all more or less effectually secured; the 'Pope Fly'\r\nis half entrapped, and is expressing a fear of being dragged in. The\r\n'Russian Fly,' of more hostile disposition, has caught his feet in the\r\nsnare: 'I declare I was half in the web before I made the discovery.'\r\nThe 'Turkish Fly' is at present free, but its security is uncertain;\r\n'I am afraid it will be my turn next.' Stout John Bull is figured as\r\nthe 'British Fly'; he is observing the wiles of the 'Corsican Spider'\r\nwithout any anxiety on his own account: 'Ay, you may look, master\r\nSpider, but I am not to be caught in your web!'\r\n\r\n_July 12, 1808._ _The Corsican Nurse soothing the Infants of Spain._\r\nWoodward del., Rowlandson sculp. Published by T. Tegg, 111 Cheapside.\r\n(245.)--Buonaparte is acting as nurse to the rival Spanish claimants,\r\nstill clad in his uniform and boots, with the indispensable cocked hat\r\nof Brobdingnagian proportions; the Emperor is lulling the entire royal\r\nfamily to sleep: with one foot he is rocking the 'Imperial Cradle,'\r\nwhich contains 'The good old King and his amiable Consort,' while\r\nDon Carlos, in swaddling clothes, with a padlock round his neck, is\r\nslumbering upon one of the Corsican's knees; upon the fellow is held\r\nAntonio under similar conditions, while the arch-deceiver is rocking\r\na duplicate Imperial Cradle containing the unconscious 'Prince of\r\nAsturias,' with his other foot.\r\n\r\n_July 22, 1808._ _The Beast as described in the Revelations (Chap.\r\n13), resembling Napoleon Buonaparte._ Designed by G. Sauler Farnham.\r\nPublished by R. Ackermann, 101 Strand.--The Beast, which has sprung\r\nfrom Corsica, is drawn with seven heads; the names of Austria, Naples,\r\nHolland, Denmark, Prussia, and Russia are on the respective crowns; the\r\nseventh head, which is of course that of Napoleon, is severed from the\r\ntrunk, while vomiting forth flames. The distance shows cities on fire,\r\nwhere the beast has wrought destruction; on his body are the figures\r\n666, the total of the numerals found in the name of Napoleon Buonaparte\r\nadded together, taking _a_ as one, _i_ as ten, _t_ as a hundred, and so\r\non.\r\n\r\nSpain is represented as the champion who has had the courage to make a\r\nstand against the monster. The patriot has crippled the destroyer; the\r\nhero is armed with a sabre of _True Spanish Toledo_, and is crying,\r\n'True patriotism shall thus subdue the monstrous beast, and quell\r\nthe rage of war.' His shield is _Catalonia_, a mitre, _St. Peter's,\r\nRome_, is his helmet; _Spanish Patriotism_ has struck the decisive blow\r\nfrom his right arm, _Asturias_; his sword-belt is _Madrid_; his legs\r\n_Cordova_; and with his foot, _Cadiz_, he is strangling a serpent. The\r\nfleet of Admiral Purvis is seen on the seas; Hope, with her anchor, is\r\nstooping to catch the crowns of France, Spain, and Portugal, which have\r\nbeen shaken from the brow of the smitten beast.\r\n\r\n_August 18, 1808._ _From the Desk to the Throne._ _A New Quick Step by\r\nJoseph Buonaparte._ _The Bass by Messrs. Nappy and Tally._ Designed\r\nby G. Sauler Farnham. Published by R. Ackermann, 101 Strand.--This\r\ncaricature was issued to burlesque the astonishing elevation of Joseph\r\nBuonaparte to the throne of Spain, of which, through his brother's\r\ningenuity, he secured a brief and by no means tranquil possession.\r\n\r\nOn Napoleon's coronation, his brothers had been created princes, and\r\nJoseph had been made King of Naples before the Spanish intrigue.\r\nThe caricaturist's version, though striking, is not literally true.\r\nAccording to the print Joseph Buonaparte has one foot resting on the\r\nrail of the desk at which he lately occupied a seat, with the other\r\nhe is endeavouring to touch Madrid on the map of Spain and Portugal.\r\nHis pen has fallen from his ear, and he is straining to clutch the\r\nroyal regalia of Spain which is above his head. From a paper pinned\r\nto the wall we are informed this remarkable promotion is taking its\r\nrise from the office of a 'public notary, Bayonne.' His fellow-clerks,\r\npausing with their quills uplifted, to marvel at this sudden flight of\r\nambition, are making various pertinent observations: 'What a prodigious\r\nstep for a notary's clerk!' One clerk is exclaiming, 'Why, Joseph,\r\nwhither art thou going?'--'Whither?' replies the elevated clerk,\r\n'Whither, but to fill my high destiny, and, like my noble brother, sway\r\nthe sceptre of another!' His colleagues are adding as riders, 'He must\r\nneeds go whom the devil drives, and should it cost his neck!'\r\n\r\n    But proverbs tell of many slips\r\n    Between the tankard and the lips,\r\n    And really I am apt to give\r\n    The proverb credit as I live!\r\n\r\n_August 21, 1808._ _King Joe's Retreat from Madrid._ Woodward del.,\r\nRowlandson sculp. Published by T. Tegg, 111 Cheapside.--The occupancy\r\nof the Spanish throne has not proved, if we may trust the print, a\r\nprofitable sinecure of long duration. King Joseph is rushing away from\r\nhis new dignity as fast as his legs will carry him; the crown has\r\nslipped off in the flight; the fugitive's invincible standards and the\r\n'Legions of Honour' are in tatters, but the hands of the Frenchmen are\r\nnot empty; king, officers, and troops are all loaded with bags of plate\r\nand bullion. The Spanish soldiers are up in arms; their priests are\r\nencouraging the pursuers, who are firing a volley into the midst of the\r\nscared invaders, while crying 'Stop thieves! stop thieves! they have\r\nstolen the plate from the palace.' Joseph's fears are too much for his\r\nself-command; he is appealing to his great little brother, 'Why don't\r\nyou stop? the Philistines are pursuing us.' Napoleon is replying from\r\nhis carriage, which is tearing away up hill as fast as his coachman can\r\nurge the horses, 'I can't, brother Joe, I am in a great hurry myself.'\r\n\r\n_August 27, 1808._ _King Joe on his Spanish Donkey._ Woodward del.,\r\nRowlandson sculp. Published by T. Tegg, 111 Cheapside.--King Joe,\r\nthe new sovereign, is finding his seat anything but easy, and even\r\nhis military saddle has proved a failure; the animal he has had the\r\ntemerity to mount has become ungovernable; the usurper is losing\r\nhis seat; the crown is flying one way, the sceptre another: 'Bless\r\nme, what a restive animal this is! I thought he would have been as\r\ngentle as a French pony, and was as easily managed as an Italian\r\ngreyhound!' The Spanish donkey is neighing at a pack of 'Saddle-bags\r\nfor the Spaniards,' and his heels are kicking to the winds the various\r\nproclamations, 'All found with arms to be shot!' 'No liberty to a\r\nSpaniard!' 'The road to fortune!' 'Joseph, King of Spain!' 'French\r\nnews!' 'No quarter!' Thumbscrews for the rebels!'\r\n\r\n_September 12, 1808._ _A Spanish Passport to France._ Woodward del.,\r\nRowlandson sculp. Published by R. Ackermann, 101 Strand.--A Spanish\r\ndon, dressed in all his ancient splendour, with a huge sombrero hat\r\nand feathers, a long Toledo rapier, and wearing his fierce moustachios\r\nturned up to his eyes, is kicking the French invader to France:\r\n'_Va-t'en, Coquin_.' The usurper, whose courage has disappeared, is\r\nsneaking off in undissembled terror; he is receiving the indignities\r\ninflicted by the don with abject servility: '_Votre très humble\r\nserviteur, monsieur_.'\r\n\r\n_September 12, 1808._ _The Political Butcher, or Spain cutting up\r\nBuonaparte, for the benefit of her neighbours._ Published by R.\r\nAckermann, 101 Strand.--The Spanish don has put on a butcher's apron\r\nand sleeves; the body of the late 'disturber of the peace of Europe' is\r\nextended on his dissecting board, and the operator is cutting up the\r\nCorsican with professional zeal. The Spaniard is holding up his enemy's\r\nhead, and encouraging the other powers, who have come to take a share\r\nin the dismemberment of the Corsican, 'Now, my little fellows, here are\r\nbones for you all to pick. The meat, being just killed, may be somewhat\r\ntoughish, but I'll warrant it fresh and high-flavoured. True Corsican\r\nveal, I assure you, you see the head!' The Imperial double-headed eagle\r\nof Austria, is swooping over this morsel: 'I have long wished to strike\r\nmy talons into that diabolical headpiece, and now I hope to do it\r\neffectually!' The Prussian eagle is crippled: 'Oh! the delicious morsel\r\nfor an eagle to pick, but my clipt wings cannot bear me so high. Cruel\r\nBoney! why cut them so short?'\r\n\r\nThe Italian greyhound is practising a new concerto called, 'If you\r\nwill not when you may, when you will it shall be nay.--The harmony by\r\nSpain and Portugal.' The Danish dog is picking all the flesh left on\r\nthe arm: 'The nearer the bone the sweeter the meat; but,' alluding to\r\nthe presence of England, 'the nearer that Bull, the less I can eat.'\r\nThe British bull-dog, who has been enjoying portions of the joints, has\r\nstarted up: 'I should like to have the picking of that head, for I dare\r\nsay it is hare-brained!' The Russian bear is indulging in the luxury of\r\nlicking the Napoleonic boots, and he is beginning to long for a taste:\r\n'This licking gives me a mortal inclination to pick a bone, as well as\r\nthe rest. But Turkey's a fine garden, and would be a vast acquisition.'\r\nSweden, a white-coated dog, is giving good counsel to her neighbour:\r\n'Yes, but a bird in the hand is worth two in the bush!'\r\n\r\nThe Dutch frog is seated on a cask of Hollands, beside a barrel of\r\n'somniferous cordial' for King Louis; he is smoking a reflective pipe\r\nover his prospects. 'If I were sure matters are as they appear I should\r\nlike to pick a bone, it is true; but wisdom bids us doubt, and prudence\r\ncondemns precipitation, so I'll e'en take another whiff!'\r\n\r\nIn the slaughter-house at the rear are shown the carcases of Murat,\r\nDupont, Junot, and others, suspended by the heels.\r\n\r\n_September 15, 1808._ _The Fox and the Grapes._ Woodward del.,\r\nRowlandson sculp. Published by R. Ackermann, 101 Strand.--The Corsican\r\nfox, who is still at large, has turned his tail on certain rich\r\nvines heavy with ripe Spanish grapes, which are growing beside fine\r\nprolific Portuguese plum-trees. The fox, who bears Napoleon's head,\r\nwith his inevitable huge cocked hat, is speciously trying to convince\r\nthe Gallic cock that the fruit, which he cannot reach, is not worth\r\ngathering, 'Believe me, my dear doodle-do, you would not like them. I\r\nfound them so sour that I absolutely could not touch them!' This excuse\r\nis not satisfactory to the hearer, 'But, my good friend, you promised\r\nto bring me home some Spanish grapes and Portugal plums; where are\r\nthey?'\r\n\r\n_September 17, 1808._ _Prophecy Explained._ '_And there are seven\r\nkings, five are fallen, and one is, and the other is not yet come, and\r\nwhen he cometh he must continue but a short space._ Revelation, chap.\r\n17, v. 10.'--The fulfilment of prophecy is pictorially set forth with\r\na completeness which must have been felt eminently satisfactory: the\r\nfive kings that have fallen, the crowned monarchs of Prussia, Bavaria,\r\nHolland, Saxony, and Wurtemberg, are all tumbling about in the 'Slough\r\nof Disgrace and Ridicule.' The one that is, is of course 'King Nap.'\r\nThe little Emperor, in all his imperial state, robes, crown, orb and\r\nsceptre, is still left standing, but his face wears an apprehensive\r\nexpression, as he is gazing on the fate of the one that 'continued but\r\na short space'--'King Joe,' to wit, who is driven beyond the Pyrenean\r\nMountains in a state of consternation, while a fair goddess, the figure\r\nof Spanish liberty, floating on the clouds, is depriving the usurper of\r\nthe Spanish crown.\r\n\r\n_September 20, 1808._ _Napoleon the Little in a Rage with his Great\r\nFrench Eagle._ Published by R. Ackermann, 101 Strand.--Napoleon, in\r\nhis general's uniform, with his sword drawn, and bristling with rage\r\nup to the tip of his preposterous feather, is menacing his huge French\r\neagle, which is much larger than himself; the Imperial crown is on the\r\nbird's head, and one of his legs is tied up--the results of damages\r\nsustained in the recent flight from Spain. It will be remembered that\r\nJoseph Buonaparte evacuated Spain August 1808. Napoleon is furiously\r\nrating his fugitive slave, 'Confusion and destruction! what is this I\r\nsee? Did I not command you not to return till you had spread your wing\r\nof victory over the whole Spanish nation?'--'Ay, it's fine talking,\r\nNap, but if you had been there, you would not much have liked it; the\r\nSpanish cormorants pursued me in such a manner that they not only\r\ndisabled one of my legs, but set me a moulting in such a terrible way\r\nthat I wonder I had not lost every feather; besides it got so hot I\r\ncould not bear it any longer!'\r\n\r\n_September 24, 1808._ _A Hard Passage, or Boney Playing Base on the\r\nContinent._ The design suggested by G.

Ackermann, 101 Strand.--Buonaparte, with a drum for a seat, and\r\nstanding on the map of the Continent, with his foot placed on Spain\r\nand Portugal, is trying to scrape through a difficult piece of music,\r\n_Conquest of Spain and Portugal_; the music book is open on a desk\r\nbefore him. 'Plague take it, I never met with so difficult a _passage_\r\nbefore. But if I can once get over the _flats_ we shall do pretty well,\r\nfor you see the key will then change to B sharp.' The Russian bear,\r\nwith a muzzle on his jaws, is trying to accompany his leader: 'Why,\r\nthat is natural enough, brother Boney, though this French horn of yours\r\nseems rather out of order, I think!'\r\n\r\n_September 25, 1808._ _King Joe & Co., Making the Most of their Time\r\nprevious to Quitting Madrid._ Published by T.

The\r\nwardrobe, carriages, and plunder from Madrid were retaken by the\r\nBritish army. The numerous carriages, of all descriptions, and tumbrils\r\nso completely blocked the road, and filled the contiguous fields,\r\nit was difficult to pass. The carriages were completely loaded with\r\nbaggage, and the miserable animals pushed into deep and wet ditches.\r\nThe four-wheeled tumbrils were loaded with ammunition and money; the\r\nsoldiers got thousands of dollars and doubloons; it is said that one\r\nman alone secured doubloons to the value of 8,000_l._ The entire\r\nplunder, baggage, money, artillery, and the supplies of the French army\r\nwere taken, carriages, animals, and a great many ladies. Joe always\r\ntravelled with a suite of the latter, generally beautiful women. It is\r\nsaid there were ten ladies of his private family with him; those were\r\nall taken; it is said he only escaped with the clothes on his back,\r\nhaving lost his hat. By way of replenishing his goods and chattels\r\nhe actually stole the linen, plate, and clothes from every place he\r\nstopped at, until he reached the French frontier.'\r\n\r\n_September 29, 1808._ _Nap and his Partner Joe._ Published by T.

Being recommended to a dealer\r\nin Moorfields (who, I think, is no honester than he ought to be), I\r\nwent to him and desired to look into his stable, and so he took me in,\r\nwith a long whip in his hand, which, he said, was to wake the horses\r\nthat might perhaps be asleep, as they were but just arrived from a long\r\njourney, coming fresh from the breeders in the North. There were some\r\nfine-looking geldings, I thought, and I pitched upon one that I thought\r\nwould suit me, and so he was saddled, and I desired the dealer to mount\r\nhim, and he did, and a very fine figure the gelding cut; and so the\r\npeople in the street said, and a decent man in a scratch-wig said the\r\nman who rode him knew how to make the most of him, and so I bought him.\r\nBut he goes in a different manner with me, for instead of his capering\r\nlike a trooper he hangs down his head and tail, and neither whip nor\r\nspur can get him out of a snail's gallop. And I want to know whether by\r\nlaw I must keep him, as he is certainly not the horse I took him for,\r\nand therefore I ought to have my money again.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HOW TO MAKE THE MOST OF A HORSE.]\r\n\r\n'\"The limner in our lane was with me when I bought him, and has taken a\r\npicture of him as he was with the dealer on his back, and another as he\r\nnow goes with me upon his back, by which you will see the difference,\r\nand judge how better to advise me upon it.\r\n\r\n                                      '\"I am, Sir, your humble servant,\r\n                                                      '\"TOBIAS HIGGINS.\r\n                                           '\"Lavender Row, Shoreditch.\"\r\n\r\n                        '_Mr. Gambado's Reply._\r\n\r\n'\"Sir--Upon a strict examination of the two pictures by the limner in\r\nyour lane, I am clear you are in possession of the identical horse\r\nyou intended to purchase, although he does not exhibit quite so much\r\nagility under you, or make so tearing a figure as when mounted by Mr.\r\n----, who I am well acquainted with, and who, you may depend, is as\r\nhonest a man as any that deals in horseflesh.\r\n\r\n'\"You could have no right to return the horse if he went no better than\r\none with his legs tied.

Relying, however, sir, as I do, on your philanthropy\r\n(I should more properly say Phillipigy) and that zeal in the cause\r\nwhich has so long characterised you, I make no doubt but the small\r\ndifficulties I now labour under will be soon surmounted.\r\n\r\n'\"You must know, sir, I am very fond of hunting, and live in as fine a\r\nscenting country as any in the kingdom. The soil is pretty stiff, the\r\nleaps large and frequent, and a great deal of timber to get over. Now,\r\nsir, my brown horse is a very capital hunter, and though he is slow,\r\nand I cannot absolutely ride over the hounds (indeed the country is so\r\nenclosed that I do not see so much of them as I could wish), yet in\r\nthe end he generally brings me in before the huntsman goes home with\r\nthe dogs. So thus far I have no reason to complain. Now, sir, my brown\r\nhorse is a noble leaper, and never gave me a fall in his life that way,\r\nbut he has got an awkward trick (though he clears everything with his\r\nfore-legs in capital style) of leaving the other two on the wrong side\r\nof the fence, and if the gate or stile happens to be in a sound state,\r\nit is a work of time and trouble to get his hind-legs over. He clears a\r\nditch finely indeed with two feet, but the others constantly fall in;\r\nthat gives me a strange pain in my back like what is commonly called\r\nlumbago, and unless you kindly stand my friend, and instruct me how I\r\nam to bring these hind-legs after me, I fear I shall never get rid of\r\nit. If you please, sir, you may ride him a-hunting yourself any day you\r\nwill please to appoint, and you shall be heartily welcome. You will\r\nthen be better enabled to give me your advice; you can't have a proper\r\nconception of the jerks he will give you without trying him.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HOW TO DO THINGS BY HALVES.]\r\n\r\n                                         '\"I am, Sir, with due respect,\r\n                                            '\"Your very humble servant,\r\n                                                 '\"NIC.

Here, sir, is a horse that lifts up his hind-legs\r\nwithout moving his fore ones, and just the reverse, as I may say, of\r\nyours, and perhaps the hint may be acceptable. Suppose, then, when\r\nyour horse has flown over a gate or a stile in his old way, with his\r\nfore-legs only, you were to dismount and clap your whip or stick\r\nproperly under his tail and then mount again, the putting him in a\r\nlittle motion will set him on his kicking principles in a hurry, and\r\nit's ten to one but, by this means, you get his hind-legs to follow the\r\nothers. You will be able, perhaps, to extricate your stick from its\r\nplace of confinement when you are up and over (if you are not down),\r\nbut should you not it is but sixpence gone. I send you this as a mere\r\nsurmise; perhaps it may answer, perhaps not.\r\n\r\n'\"I beg to thank you for your offer, which is a very kind one, but I\r\nbeg to be excused accepting it; all my ambition being to add to the\r\ntheory with as little practice as possible.\r\n\r\n                            '\"I am, Rev.

But so it\r\nhappened. The old mare, that I could never get to go above three miles\r\nan hour, as soon as ever I was up, set off, and the devil couldn't stop\r\nher till she got home--ten miles in about fifty-eight minutes. I'm in a\r\nheat yet. But I have found out her motive, and now the public may make\r\nuse of it. I had bought a couple of lobsters to carry home, had their\r\nclaws tied up, and put one into each of my great-coat pockets. Well,\r\nthe old gentleman in my right pocket (a cunning one, I warrant him)\r\nsomehow or other contrived to disengage his hands, and no doubt soon\r\napplied them to the old mare's side, and, I imagine, had got fast hold\r\nof a rib by the time I reached the first mile-stone, for she was mad, I\r\nthought, and my hat and wig were gone in a twinkle. However, when I got\r\noff, and had taken a little breath, I went into the kitchen to unload,\r\nbut missed one of my lobsters; so I ran back into the stable, and there\r\nwas the hero hanging at the old mare's side; she'd had enough of it,\r\nand so stood quiet.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HOW TO MAKE THE MARE TO GO.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HOW TO PREVENT A HORSE SLIPPING HIS GIRTHS.]\r\n\r\n'\"I thought myself bound to inform you of this, hoping it would prove a\r\ngreat national discovery. I mean to keep lobsters on purpose, for it's\r\ncheaper than buying a horse instead of my old mare; and I can go faster\r\nwith one of them in my pocket than I could post. When my boys come home\r\nfrom school, to hunt in the forest, I mean to treat each of them with a\r\ncray-fish for his pony, and then, I think, we shall head the field.\r\n\r\n                                     '\"I am, sir, yours, ever in haste,\r\n                                                       '\"PETER PUFFIN.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE APOTHEOSIS OF GEOFFREY GAMBADO, ESQ.]\r\n\r\n'_Letter to_ MR. G. GAMBADO, _editor of various learned performances_.\r\n\r\n'\"SIR,--You have no doubt heard of a description of Natural\r\nPhilosophers, called Pigeon Fanciers, who breed the bird of that name,\r\nand all its varieties. I was once, sir, a member of this community,\r\ntill growing tired of punters, tumblers, nuns, croppers, runts, &c.,\r\n&c., I was resolved to enlarge my ideas, by extending my researches\r\nand abandoning the biped, to obtain a closer acquaintance with the\r\nquadruped. I became a horse-fancier. Being fond of riding, and daily\r\nobserving, in my airings to Brentford, a great variety of horses, and a\r\nstill greater variety in their motions, I, some years since, set about\r\nmaking a collection of such as were singular and eccentric in their\r\nshapes and actions, and I flatter myself no private museum can boast\r\nof a more admirable variety than I have possessed.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n'\"As amongst pigeons, so amongst horses, there are tumblers. The feat\r\nis, however, performed differently, and varies considerably in its\r\neffect on the performers. As the pigeon executes this without anything\r\non its back, so the horse seldom achieves it without somebody upon his.\r\nTo the latter, therefore, we must give the greatest share of merit,\r\nwho ventures to perform upon a hard road what the other does only in\r\nthe air, without even a cloud to brush against. The one preferring, it\r\nseems, the Milky, and the other the Highway.\r\n\r\n'\"Among horses, I have never discovered a pouter; but I have had a\r\nfine puffer. The noise he made, however, and particularly when at his\r\nbusiness, was not pleasant; and I let a neighbour have him cheap,\r\nwho had a good three-stall museum, and a very heavy vehicle to draw;\r\nso that in all weathers he might enjoy the entertainment of his very\r\nextraordinary qualifications.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE TUMBLER, OR ITS AFFINITIES.]\r\n\r\n'\"It is well known that there is a horse that is called a carrier, so\r\nthere is a pigeon likewise. But as it may not be known to every one, I\r\nmust inform you that from very long observation, I find the pigeon is\r\nthe most expeditious of the two.\r\n\r\n                                 '\"I am, sir, your very humble servant,\r\n                                                       '\"BENJ. BUFFON.\"\r\n\r\n                     'ADVICE TO WOULD-BE HORSEMEN.\r\n\r\n'I have given you the hints contained in my previous letters supposing\r\nyou are at home enough on horseback to ride out alone, and may possibly\r\nbe tempted to travel the road, as either the lucre of gain, or the\r\n_universal passion_, as a celebrated author calls the love of fame, may\r\nsend you forth.\r\n\r\n'Let me entreat you to examine your tackling well at setting out,\r\nparticularly from an inn and after dinner. See that your girths are\r\ntight; many a good fall have I got by not attending to this. Ostlers\r\nare too apt to be careless, and ought never to be paid till we see\r\nthem the next time.[7] An instance of a singular nature occurred at\r\nHuntingdon a few years since to the Rev. D. B., of Jesus College,\r\nin Cambridge, which has given a discovery to the world (productive,\r\nindeed, of a paper war), but which may turn out beneficial to mankind,\r\nas it proves 3 to be equal to 4.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HOW TO RIDE A HORSE UPON THREE LEGS.]\r\n\r\n'The Doctor dined at the \"Crown\"; it was dusk when he set out\r\nnorthwards. I myself saw 3_s._ charged in his bill for wine; this\r\naccounts for his want of observation. As for the ostler's, I must\r\nattribute it to his having been paid beforehand. The Doctor went off\r\nat a spurt pretty much in the manner I have recommended, and having\r\ngot clear of the pavement he wished to (what is called) mend his pace;\r\nbut his horse was obdurate, and all his influence could not prevail.\r\nThe Doctor fancied at times he went oddly, and therefore brought to at\r\nAlconbury, five miles from Huntingdon, and alighted for an examination,\r\nwhen he discovered that the ostler, through inattention, had buckled up\r\none of the horse's hind-legs in the surcingle; and to this alone he had\r\nto attribute his hobbling way of going.\r\n\r\n'There was an ostler[8] at Barnet who was a moralist, possibly this at\r\nHuntingdon was an experimental philosopher, and thought an old member\r\nof the University the most proper subject to put his experiment in\r\nexecution. It certainly answered as far as five miles; but how it would\r\nsucceed in bringing horses of different forms together over Newmarket,\r\nI am not competent to determine. It seems as if one might work a lame\r\nhorse thus and keep his unsound leg quiet. If this experiment has been\r\nrepeated it has been in private, for I have not heard of it; and I much\r\nquestion if it would ever be generally adopted. When I say _generally_,\r\nno reflection upon general officers. A timid major, however, might keep\r\nhis horse in due subjection on a review day by this method.\r\n\r\n                                                     'GEOFFREY GAMBADO.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DR.

I'd\r\nnothing for't but to hold fast round his neck, and to squeeze me elbows\r\nin to keep the stays safe; and egad, off we set, and never stopt till\r\nI got to the bottom. He never moved a leg didn't my horse, but slided\r\npromiscuously, as I may say, till he oversate somebody on the road; I\r\nwas too flurrisome to see who: and the first body I see'd it was a poor\r\nman axing charity in a hat.

Rowlandson, and\r\npublished by R. Ackermann, 101 Strand.--Frontispiece: The title in a\r\nframe; below it a gouty old miser, wrapped in flannel, is being dragged\r\noff in his chair by Death, in spite of his crutch and his struggles to\r\nget back to his riches, spread in the strong box, over which he has\r\nlost all control; his heirs in the meantime are helping themselves,\r\nmaking light of his hoarded savings, and taunting the impotent\r\nmoney-grubber, who has accumulated riches for them to fling away.\r\n\r\n_Miseries of Human Life._--Introductory dialogue: 'Sickness befriends\r\ntemperance by the simplicity of diet which it introduces; it wards off\r\nthe varied injuries of the open air by requiring the party to inhale\r\na thousand times over, the cherishing, equable, and safely treasured\r\natmosphere of a chamber.'\r\n\r\nThe picture treats all these fanciful advantages from a burlesque\r\npoint of view: a sufferer is on his pallet surrounded by all the\r\ninconveniences of washing, cooking, and other domestic arrangements,\r\nlimited to _one apartment_, to serve him as 'kitchen, parlour, and\r\nbed-room, and all.'\r\n\r\n_Miseries of the Country._--Following on horseback a slow cart, through\r\nan endless narrow lane, at sunset, when you are already too late, and\r\nwant all the help of your own eyes, as well as your horse's feet to\r\ncarry you safe through the rest of your unknown way.\r\n\r\n_More Miseries._--'Being overpersuaded to stand up in a country dance,\r\nwhen you know, or, what is equally bad, conceive that a bear would\r\neclipse you in grace and agility.' (_April 1, 1807._)\r\n\r\n_Fabricious's Description of the Poets._ Vide 'Gil Blas.'--'People\r\nthink that we often dine with Democritus, and there they are mistaken.\r\nThere is not one of my fraternity, not even excepting the makers of\r\nAlmanacs, who is not welcome to some good table. As for my own part,\r\nthere are two families where I am received with pleasure. I have two\r\ncovers laid for me every day, one at the house of a fat director of the\r\nfarms, to whom I have dedicated a romance, and the other at the house\r\nof a rich citizen, who has the disease of being thought to entertain\r\nwits every day at his table; luckily he is not very delicate in his\r\nchoice, and the city furnishes him with great plenty.' (1807.)\r\n\r\n_Miseries of Human Life._--Struggling through the curse of trying to\r\ndisentangle your hair, when by poking curiously about on board of ship\r\nit has become clammed and matted with pitch or tar, far beyond all the\r\npowers of the comb. (1807.)\r\n\r\n_More Miseries._--Having so flaccid a cheek that the parish barber, who\r\nshaves you, is obliged to introduce his thumb into your mouth to give\r\nit a proper projection, cutting his thumb in this position with the\r\nrazor. (1807.)\r\n\r\n_Miseries of Social Life._--Escorting four or five country cousins,\r\non their first importation into London from the _Terra Incognita_ of\r\nEngland, to the lions, the waxworks, the monuments, &c. &c.\r\n\r\n_Miseries Miscellaneous._--Stepping out of a boat at low water on a\r\nslippery causeway, upon a stone which slides under you, and you descend\r\nin the mud up to the chin. (1807.)\r\n\r\n_A Stag at Bay, or Conjugal Felicity._ _A Romance._--A matrimonial\r\ndispute; the wife is attacking her spouse incontinently, and he is\r\nprotecting himself, and keeping the aggressor at arm's length with a\r\ndirty mop.\r\n\r\n_The Shaver and the Shavee._ H. Bunbury del., Rowlandson sc.\r\n\r\n_Showing off._--A pair of horsemen are endeavouring to put on\r\na sportsmanlike appearance, which is somewhat disturbed by the\r\nrestiveness of their steeds; one rider is slipping off, and the other,\r\nwhile his horse is going down on his knees in a reverential posture, is\r\nflung over the animal's head.\r\n\r\n_The Production of a Post-House._--The stable-door of a post-house is\r\nopened, and a sorry broken-kneed ramshackle horse is trotted out, to\r\nthe amusement of the people standing about, and to the horror of a\r\ngentleman who has evidently come for a mount.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms of Choking._--A corpulent individual has suddenly left the\r\ndinner-table, under an impulse to choke; the rest of the company are\r\nthrown into such alarm at his critical situation, that the table-cloth,\r\nsoup-turreens, wine, decanters, plates, glasses, and all the service\r\nare dragged on to the floor in universal destruction. (1806.)\r\n\r\n_The Enraged Vicar._--A smaller version of this subject (see March 1,\r\n1807).\r\n\r\n    To see them rattle, howl, and tear,\r\n    By Jove, 'twould make a parson swear.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms of Restiveness._--The restiveness referred to appears to be\r\nnothing more than a tendency to rest in one spot; a sailor, probably\r\nat Portsmouth, from the view of the sea and shipping, is mounted on\r\na steed which he is vainly belabouring with a cudgel, while an old\r\nhag is banging away at the poor brute with a long and heavy broom,\r\nto the delight of a convivial party, assembled to drink outside a\r\npublic-house, within view of the dilemma. (1808.)\r\n\r\n_Pall Mall._\r\n\r\n    O bear me to the paths of fair Pall Mall,\r\n    Safe are thy pavements, grateful is thy smell;\r\n    At distance rolls along the gilded coach,\r\n    Nor sturdy carmen on thy walks encroach. (1807.)\r\n\r\n_Miseries of Public Places._--After the play, on a raw, wet night, with\r\na party of ladies, fretting and freezing in the outer lobbies and at\r\nthe street-doors of the theatre, among chairmen, barrow-women, yelling\r\nlinkboys, and other human refuse, in endless attempts to find out your\r\nservant or carriage, which, when found out at last, cannot be drawn up\r\nnearer than a furlong from the door. (_January 1, 1807._)\r\n\r\n_Miseries Miscellaneous._--The necessity of sending a verbal message\r\nof the utmost consequence by an ass, who, you plainly perceive, will\r\nforget (or rather has already forgotten) every word you have been\r\nsaying. (_January 1, 1807._)\r\n\r\n_Miseries of Reading and Writing._--As you are writing drowsily by\r\nthe fire, on rousing and recollecting yourself, find your guardian in\r\npossession of your secret thoughts, which he never ceases to upbraid\r\nyou with. (_January 1, 1807._)\r\n\r\n_Miseries Personal._--When in the gout receiving the ruinous salutation\r\nof a muscular friend (a sea captain), who, seizing your hand in the\r\nfirst transports of a sudden meeting, affectionately crumbles your\r\nchalky knuckles with the gripe of a grasping-iron, and then further\r\nconfirms his regard for you by greeting your tenderest toe with the\r\nstamp of a charger. (_January 1, 1807._)\r\n\r\n_Miseries of the Country._--While you are out with a walking party,\r\nafter heavy rains, one shoe suddenly sucked off by the boggy clay,\r\nand then, in making a long and desperate stretch (which fails), with\r\nthe hope of recovering it, the other is left in the same predicament.\r\nThe second stage of ruin is that of standing, or rather tottering in\r\nblank despair, with both bare feet planted ankle-deep in the quagmire.\r\n(_January 1, 1806._)\r\n\r\n_Miseries of London._--Chasing your hat (just blown off in a high wind)\r\nthrough a muddy street--a fresh gust always whisking it away at the\r\nmoment of seizing it; when you have at last caught it deliberately\r\nputting it on, with all its sins upon your head, amidst the jeers of\r\nthe populace. (_January 1, 1807._)\r\n\r\n_Miseries of Travelling._ '_O Miserabile mihi._' Published by T.\r\nRowlandson, Adelphi.--A restive horse in a gig backing into the\r\nwindows of a potter's shop; alarmed at the terrific crash, you become\r\npanic-struck, with the perspiration starting from every pore. (_April\r\n12, 1807._)\r\n\r\n_Miseries of Travelling._--Being mounted on a beast who, as soon as you\r\nhave watered him on the road, proceeds very coolly to repose himself in\r\nthe middle of the pond, without taking you at all into his counsel or\r\npaying the slightest attention to your remonstrances. (1807.)\r\n\r\n_Miseries of Social Life._--Sitting for hours before a smoky chimney,\r\nlike a Hottentot in a kraal; then, just as your sufferings seem at last\r\nto be at an end, puff, puff, whiff, whiff, again, far more furious than\r\never. Add to this a scolding wife. (_January 1, 1807._)\r\n\r\n_Miseries of Social Life._--Walking in a wind that cuts to the bone,\r\nwith a narrating companion, whose mind and body cannot move at the\r\nsame time; or, in other words, who, as he gets on with his stories,\r\nthinks it necessary, at every other sentence, to stand stock-still,\r\nface about, and make you do the same; then, totally regardless of your\r\nshivering impatience to push on, refuses to stir an inch till the whole\r\nof his endless thread is fairly wound out. 'Dixit et adversi stetit\r\nora.' (1807.)\r\n\r\n_Miseries of the Country._--Losing your way on foot at night in a storm\r\nof wind and rain, and this immediately after leaving a merry fireside.\r\n(1806.)\r\n\r\n_More Miseries._--Being nervous and cross-examined by Mr. Garrow (in a\r\nLaw Court). (_April 1, 1807._)\r\n\r\n_More Miseries._--Endeavouring to make violent love under the table and\r\npressing the wrong foot. (_April 1, 1807._)\r\n\r\n_More Miseries._--Sitting on a chair which a servant has fractured and\r\nput together the preceding morning, and upon attempting to lean back\r\nfalling to the ground before a large party; a country servant bursting\r\ninto a roar of laughter. (_April 1, 1807._)\r\n\r\n_More Miseries._--Being obliged to kiss a remarkably plain woman at\r\nforfeits, when you engaged in the pastime only with the hope of being\r\nable to salute a lovely young lady, to whom you are particularly\r\nattached. (_April 1, 1807._)\r\n\r\n_Miseries of Travelling._--Starting for a long ride, on a dinner\r\nengagement, without a great-coat, in a mist, a mizzle, a drizzle, a\r\nrain, a torrent. On arriving at the house at last, completely drenched,\r\nyou have to beg the favour of making yourself look like a full or empty\r\nsack, by wearing your host's clothes, he being either a dwarf or a\r\ngiant, and you the contrary. (_January 1, 1807._)\r\n\r\n_Miseries of Games, Sports, &c._--In skating, slipping in such a manner\r\nthat your legs start off in this unaccommodating posture; from which,\r\nhowever, you are soon relieved by tumbling forwards on your nose, or\r\nbackwards on your skull. Also learning to cut the outside edge on\r\nskates that have no edge to cut with--ice very rugged. (_January 1,\r\n1807._)\r\n\r\n_More Miseries._--In the country, going to a party to dinner, getting\r\nvery tipsy, quitting the house in a dark night, and getting upon your\r\nhorse with your face towards the tail, and wondering during the few\r\nminutes that you are able to keep your seat, amidst the jeers of your\r\ncompanions, what freak can have entered the brain of the beast to go\r\nbackwards. (_April 1, 1807._)\r\n\r\n_Miseries of the Table._--Inviting a friend, whom you know to be\r\nparticularly fond of the dish, to partake of a fine hare, haunch, &c.,\r\nwhich you have endeavoured to keep exactly to the critical moment, but\r\nwhich is no sooner brought in than the whole party, with one nose,\r\norder it to be taken out. (1807.)\r\n\r\n_More Miseries._--At an inn, going into a bed too short, with a wooden\r\nleg, which you were too fatigued to unstrap, drawing up the living one,\r\ngoing to sleep with the other sticking out at the bottom, which, when\r\nthe chambermaid comes in for the candle, she conceives to be the handle\r\nof the warming-pan, which she has carelessly left in the bed. (_April\r\n1, 1807._)\r\n\r\n_More Miseries._--Sending a challenge, requesting a timid friend to\r\nattend you to the field, who, you think, will not fail to acquaint the\r\nmagistrate of it; going with honour to the appointed spot, anxiously\r\nlooking back at every step to see if the Bow Street officers are\r\ncoming, without seeing a soul but your antagonist and the seconds.\r\n(_April 1, 1807._)\r\n\r\n_Miseries Domestic._--Squatting plump on an unsuspected cat in your\r\nchair. (_January 1, 1807._)\r\n\r\n_More Miseries._--Being persuaded to put your finger into the cage\r\nof a parrot and to rub its poll, upon an assurance, from its doating\r\nmistress, that it is the most gentle bird in the universe, suddenly\r\nfeeling the sanguinary effects of its beak. (_April 1, 1807._)\r\n\r\n_More Miseries._--Having a newly-rolled gravel walk, finding some\r\nfriends whom you had asked to dine with you amusing themselves before\r\ndinner by drawing each other in your child's chaise, which disastrously\r\nstood at the bottom of the garden, within sight; seeing the narrow\r\nwheels cut up the walk most unmercifully, and being deterred by a false\r\nnotion of politeness from giving them a hint to desist. (_April 1,\r\n1807._)\r\n\r\n_Cold Broth and Calamity._--A smaller edition of this subject, the\r\ndisasters of various parties on the ice, but treated with perfect\r\noriginality as regards the various incidents.\r\n\r\n_Miseries Domestic._--Waking in the middle of the night in a state\r\nof raging thirst, eagerly blundering to the washing-stand, and there\r\nfinding the broad-mouthed pitcher, which you lift to your lips, so\r\nfull that, besides amply satisfying your thirst, it keeps cooling your\r\nheated body, and purifying your linen with the overplus. (_1806._)\r\n\r\n_Miseries of the Country._ Published by T. Rowlandson,\r\nAdelphi.--Passing the worst part of a rainy winter in a country so\r\ninveterately miry as to imprison you within your own premises; so that\r\nby way of exercise, and to keep yourself alive, you take to rolling\r\nyour gravel walks (though already quite smooth), cutting wood (though\r\nyou have more logs than enough), working the dumb-bells, or such other\r\nirrational exercise. (_April 12, 1807._)\r\n\r\n_Miseries of the Country._--While deeply, delightfully, and, as you\r\nhope, safely engaged at home in the morning, after peremptory orders\r\nof denial to all comers whomsoever, to be suddenly surprised, through\r\nthe treachery or folly of your servant, by an inroad from a party of\r\nthe starched, stupid, cold, idle natives of a country town, who lay a\r\nformal siege (by sap) to your leisure. (_1807._)\r\n\r\n_Miseries of London._--Being a compulsory spectator and auditor of a\r\nbrawling and scratching match between two drunken drabs, in consequence\r\nof the sudden influx of company, by whom you are hemmed in a hundred\r\nyards deep in every direction, leaving you no chance of escape till the\r\ndifference of sentiment between the ladies is adjusted. Where you stand\r\nyou are (that is, I was) closely bounded in front by a barrow of cat's\r\nmeat, the unutterable contents of which employ your eyes and nose,\r\nwhile your ear is no less fully engaged by the Tartarean yell of its\r\ndriver. (_1807._)\r\n\r\n_Miseries of Travelling._--On packing up your clothes for a journey,\r\nbecause your servant is a fool, the burning fever into which you are\r\nthrown when, after all your standing, stamping, kneeling, tugging, and\r\nkicking, the lid of your trunk refuses to approach within a yard of the\r\nlock. (_1807._)\r\n\r\n_More Miseries._ Published by R. Ackermann.--Being pinned up to a door,\r\nround the neck, by the horns of an enraged overdriven ox.

ACKERMANN, REPOSITORY OF ARTS, 101 STRAND.\r\n\r\nWith reference to the illustrations, which form the principal feature\r\nof this work, we borrow a paragraph from the 'Introduction':--\r\n\r\n'The great objection that men fond of the fine arts have hitherto made\r\nto engravings on architectural subjects has been that the buildings and\r\nfigures have almost invariably been designed by the same artists. In\r\nconsequence of this the figures have been generally neglected, or are\r\nof a very inferior cast, and totally unconnected with the other part\r\nof the print; so that we may sometimes see men and women in English\r\ndresses delineated in an English view of an Italian palace, and Spanish\r\ngrandees in long cloaks and ladies in veils seated in one of our own\r\ncathedrals.\r\n\r\n    The dress, we know, is neither new nor rare;\r\n    But how the powers came it there?\r\n\r\n'To remove these glaring incongruities from the publication, a strict\r\nattention has been paid, not only to the country of the figures\r\nintroduced in the different buildings, but to the general air and\r\npeculiar carriage, habits, &c., of such characters as are likely to\r\nmake up the majority in particular places.\r\n\r\n'The architectural part of the subjects that are contained in this work\r\nwill be delineated, with the utmost precision and care, by Mr. Pugin,\r\nwhose uncommon accuracy and elegant taste have been displayed in former\r\nproductions. With respect to the figures, they are from the pencil of\r\nMr. Rowlandson, with whose professional talents the public are already\r\nso well acquainted that it is not necessary to expatiate on them here.\r\nAs the following list comprises almost every variety of character that\r\nis found in this great metropolis, there will be ample scope for the\r\nexertion of his abilities; and it will be found that his powers are not\r\nconfined to the ludicrous, but that he can vary with his subject, and,\r\nwherever it is necessary, descend\r\n\r\n    From grave to gay, from lively to severe.'\r\n\r\nRowlandson and Pugin del. et sc.\r\n\r\n  1.

Woodward, Esq.\r\n(author of 'Eccentric Excursions'). Rowlandson, sc. 12mo. London.\r\nPrinted for Thomas Tegg.\r\n\r\n    I will be more jealous of thee than a Barbary cock-pigeon over his\r\n      hen;\r\n              More clamorous than a parrot against rain;\r\n              More new-fangled than an ape;\r\n    And more giddy in my desires than a monkey.--SHAKESPEARE.\r\n\r\nFolding frontispiece.--A Savoyard with a barrel-organ and a troupe\r\nof dancing dogs; a Frenchman with a dancing bear; a showman dragging\r\nabout a dromedary, with a monkey perched on its hump, and pulling\r\nthe animal's ears. A bird made to fire off a gun, in the rear of a\r\nhalf-starved individual who is lost in hungry longing outside the\r\nwindow of an eating-house; while the proprietor is taunting the\r\nfamished gazer with a huge round of beef. A cat is torturing a mouse.\r\nA woman is eavesdropping. Another cat is getting a bird out of a cage.\r\nA woman is emptying a vessel over the heads of a crowd gathered round\r\na tussle. A cat is launched in the air on bladders. A pair of ruffians\r\nare racing on donkeys, and flogging the beasts unmercifully. All these\r\nepisodes set forth various phases of the fine art of Tormenting.\r\n\r\n1. A old vixen is tormenting a pretty maid, who is in tears: 'Don't\r\ncry, child. You cannot help being handsome; but I assure you I have\r\noften wept from my dreadful apprehensions for you, lest you should come\r\nto walk London streets!'\r\n\r\n2. A family scene.\r\n\r\n  Train up a child in the way it should go,\r\n  and when he is old he will not depart from it.\r\n                                        SOLOMON.\r\n\r\nTwo children have strung up a pair of kittens by their tails; the\r\ntabbies are clawing one another in the air. Two boys have tied a\r\nsaucepan to the tail of a frightened dog, and a little girl is singeing\r\na cat's whiskers with a brand from the fire. The father is smoking his\r\npipe and declaring, 'Dear little innocents, how prettily they amuse\r\nthemselves!' while the mother is made to say, 'I love to see children\r\nemployed!'\r\n\r\n3. A husband, with literary tastes, is vainly trying to interest his\r\nlady in his reading: 'Now, my dear, now for the passage; I am sure\r\nit will delight you. Shakespeare, \"Tempest,\" act the fifth. \"The\r\ncloud-capt towers, the gorgeous palaces----\"' The wife is bouncing up\r\nto the bell, although there is a blazing fire, interrupting the reading\r\nwith, 'I wonder the girl don't bring the coals, one might as well sit\r\nin an ice house, but I was born to be tormented!'\r\n\r\n4. An old curmudgeon is seated in his armchair, a decanter of wine\r\nbefore him, with a chart of the gold mines of Peru and Mexico at his\r\nback; a young gentleman, who has been unfortunate, is standing before\r\nhim in an attitude of despondency, little encouraged by the friendly\r\nadvice of the hunks whose assistance he has vainly implored: 'Ah,\r\nmy young friend, I told you what it would all come to, but you have\r\nbrought it all on yourself. I'll not ask you to sit down, because you\r\nseem in a hurry; however, I'll give you my advice: as you say you are\r\nnot worth a guinea, I'd advise you to quit London, and purchase a small\r\nestate in the country!'\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[7] A learned dancing-master in the University of Oxford, who taught\r\npoliteness also, and published a book upon that subject, fixed the\r\nsame period for passing a stile in some cases that is here judiciously\r\nrecommended for the payment of an ostler. His precept was that a\r\nwell-bred man meeting another on the opposite side of a stile ought on\r\nno account to be persuaded to go over first. The name of this ingenious\r\nauthor was Towle. Had two zealous pupils of his school met each other\r\nat a stile, it is supposed they must have concluded their lives on the\r\npremises.\r\n\r\n[8] James Ripley, many years ostler at the \"Red Lion,\" who published a\r\nvolume of letters.\r\n\r\n[9] George Stevens, the originator of the 'Lecture on Heads,' was a\r\nvery indifferent actor, but a man of humorous parts, and in himself\r\nwas considered, by his contemporaries, most entertaining company. The\r\nidea of the lecture was given him by a country carpenter, who made the\r\ncharacter-blocks which formed the subjects of illustration. It proved\r\nan extraordinary success in the hands of the originator. He carried\r\nit about England, through the States of America, and, on his return,\r\nto Ireland; and managed to net some ten thousand pounds by this lucky\r\nventure. After he retired more than one actor attempted it, with poor\r\nresults. Lewis was the most successful of Stevens's imitators, and he\r\nhad made such arrangements with the author as entitled the latter to a\r\nroyalty for the use of his 'Lecture on Heads.' It probably derived its\r\nprincipal charm from the style of its delivery. Read in cold blood, its\r\nbrilliancy and point are by no means startling.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1809.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Discovery._ Etched by Rowlandson, 1798. Republished, Jan. 1808-9.\r\n\r\n_January 15, 1809._ _The Head of the Family in Good Humour._ Published\r\nby Tegg, Woodward del., Rowlandson sc.--John Bull, a very giant among\r\na race of pigmies, is surrounded by the heads of the different states,\r\nwho are all hurling out threats against his chances of peace. Napoleon\r\nis thundering for _Ships, Colonies, and Commerce_. The Muscovite\r\nis denouncing: 'Russian vengeance attend John Bull.' Holland is\r\nblustering: 'I'll eternally smoke him.' Tom Paine is offering this\r\nwarning: 'Let him tremble at the name of America.' The other potentates\r\nare following up these threats with valedictions of their own:\r\n'Beware of Prussia;' 'Austria will never pardon him;' 'Spanish fury\r\novertake him;' and 'Let him beware of Denmark.' John Bull is smiling\r\ngood-naturedly at all these empty vapourings: 'Don't make such a riot,\r\nyou little noisy brats, all your bustle to me is no more than a storm\r\nin a teacup!'\r\n\r\n_January 15, 1809._ _The Old Woman's Complaint, or the Greek Alphabet._\r\nPublished by T. Tegg, 111 Cheapside.--An old country dame has called\r\nupon a pedagogue, with a fanciful grievance, to make respectful\r\ncomplaints against the dominie's scholars, who, cap in hand, and\r\nsatchel on back, are making their entrance into the learned presence,\r\nbehind their accuser. The schoolmaster, who wears a red night-cap, and\r\nslippers, is made to say: 'Good woman, you are always making complaints\r\nagainst my scholars; what have they done to offend you now?' 'Please\r\nyour honour's worship, they followed me up and down, and said one to\r\nanother, _at her, beat her, damn her, pelt her!_ and a great deal more\r\nthat I do not recollect.' The young pupils are explaining the old\r\nlady's misconception: 'Indeed, sir, we were only repeating our Greek\r\nalphabet, in order to get it quite perfect; what the old woman heard\r\nwas only _Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Delta_, and so on to the conclusion!'\r\n\r\n_February 1, 1809._ _A Traveller refreshed in a Stagnant Pool, after\r\nthe Fatigues of a Dusty Day's Journey._ Published by R.

Tegg, 67 Cheapside.--A trim nymph, very\r\nfashionably dressed, is starting on her travels from an hotel,\r\nsituated, as we recognise, from the notice on the wall, near Portsmouth\r\nDock. The figure of the promenader is drawn with care, and is perfectly\r\nin Rowlandson's most telling manner; behind the curled, feathered,\r\nand blooming damsel, is an ancient and colossal harridan, bedizened\r\nwith showy finery, who is supposed to have launched the fair charmer.\r\nCharacteristic glimpses of Portsmouth are given in the background of\r\nthe picture.\r\n\r\n_March 20, 1809._ _A Mad Dog in a Coffee House._ Published by T.\r\nRowlandson, 1 James Street, Adelphi.--The advent of a nondescript\r\nanimal, supposititiously assumed to be a ferocious mad dog, has\r\nproduced the utmost terror and confusion amongst the grave frequenters\r\nof a mercantile coffee-house, somewhat after the model of _Garraway's_.\r\nAll the city brokers, and pillars of 'change found therein, are scared\r\nout of their sober senses; some, like the little Jew in the corner, are\r\nparalysed with fear; others are trying to creep under the tables; a few\r\nare seeking escape by the door, which they are effectually blocking;\r\nand groups of affrighted fugitives are endeavouring to gain the refuge\r\nof the staircase. A select knot have made for the bar, and are flinging\r\nthemselves _pell-mell_ over the counter; the chimney, and similar\r\nplaces of refuge, are eagerly sought; tables are mounted; comfortable\r\ncitizens are thrown on their backs, like turtles, and trodden on, while\r\nthe pressure of viler bodies above is expressing a stream of specie\r\nfrom the well-filled pockets of the overthrown. A cat, her tail swollen\r\nto abnormal proportions, is making a frantic rush into the midst of\r\nthe cowering poltroons under the table. Rowlandson generally manages\r\nto introduce certain advertisements appropriate to his subjects, and\r\na notice stuck on the wall of the coffee-house conveys the following\r\npiece of shipping intelligence: _For the Brazils, 'The Cerberus,'\r\nCaptain Pointer. Burden 300 tons. Laying off Barking Creek. Enquire of\r\nBenjamin Bell, Barge Yard, Broker_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A MAD DOG IN A COFFEE HOUSE.]\r\n\r\n1809. _Disappointed Epicures._ Another version of _A Mad Dog in a\r\nDining-room_.--In this case the dog has run between the legs of a\r\nman bringing in a dish of cutlets, which bestrew the carpet; his\r\ndownfall has in turn overset another retainer, whose soup tureen has\r\ncome to grief; the butler, more engaged in watching the calamities\r\nof his fellows, has allowed the 'spruce beer' to escape in a shower\r\nof froth all over the place. The scene is well worked out; over the\r\ndoor of the dining-room is a picture representing a party of corpulent\r\nfriars seated round a refectory board. The faces of the party--it is a\r\nbachelor-dinner in this instance--express more annoyance than alarm;\r\nthey are dejected at the prospect of a curtailed repast.\r\n\r\n1809. _A Mad Dog in a Dining-room, or Disappointed Epicures._--This\r\nprint, which has never before been engraved in its present form, is a\r\nliteral reproduction of the original study; one of the collection of\r\ndrawings by Rowlandson in the possession of the present writer. The\r\npicture tells its own story so graphically, that it is unnecessary to\r\nattempt any fuller elucidation of the subject.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A MAD DOG IN A DINING-ROOM.]\r\n\r\n_April 21, 1809._ _The Comforts of Matrimony. A Good Toast._ Published\r\nby Reeve and Jones.--The picture represents a scene of domestic\r\nfelicity of the most touching completeness. The husband is browning\r\na muffin for tea; his wife's arm is wound round his neck during this\r\ndelicate operation; his children are enjoying their peaceful meal; an\r\ninfant is tranquilly slumbering in the cradle; and a cat, surrounded by\r\nher family of kittens, carries out the unity of the subject. Another of\r\nthe series partly published in 1808, in which a rude facsimile of the\r\noriginal drawings has been attempted, without much success.\r\n\r\n_The Tables Turned. Miseries of Wedlock._ A pendant to the\r\npreceding.--The domestic horizon is clouded by storms. The late happy\r\npair are only kept from demolishing each other by the table placed\r\nbetween them, which is being wrecked in the struggle. The wife, in a\r\nfury, is holding on to her husband's hair with all her force, while\r\nhe has a firm grasp of his unfortunate spouse's head, at which he is\r\naiming a pewter-pot; children, chairs, crockery, cutlery, and food,\r\nare alike devoted to destruction; the infants are frantic, and general\r\nmisery prevails. The execution of these subjects is commonplace, and\r\nthe engraver has not done justice to the originals.\r\n\r\n_April 29, 1809._ _Oh! you're a Devil. Get along, do!_ Published by\r\nReeve and Jones, 7 Vere Street, New Bond Street.--A dashing young\r\nofficer, a gallant adventurer, probably crippled with debts, and with\r\nnothing but his commission to support his extravagances, is laying\r\nardent siege to the ordinary person of a rich dowager, fat, _not_ fair,\r\nand decidedly forty; indeed, the lady is more than old enough to be the\r\nmother of her insidious admirer, who is probably looking forward to\r\nthe possession of the foolish inamorata's fortune to 'whitewash' his\r\nliabilities, and exchange him from one slavery to another; preferring\r\nthe fetters of Hymen to the captivity of a debtor's prison. The lady,\r\na vain piece of antiquated and frivolous vulgarity, is loaded with\r\nmassive jewellery, which her hopeful lover no doubt looks forward\r\nto melting for his own purposes, after he has staked the relict's\r\nmoney-bags on the gambling-table; her feathers are profuse, and she\r\nwears a boa of an extinct kind, famous in the annals of contemporary\r\nfashions, known as a _rattle-snake_.[10]\r\n\r\n_June 20, 1809._ _A Tit-bit for a Strong Stomach._\r\n\r\n_July 31, 1809._ _The Huntsman Rising.

YOU'RE A DEVIL. GET ALONG, DO!]\r\n\r\nGeorge the Third's darling son, the favourite Frederick, on whom he\r\ndoted, and who was so popular out of doors that he was hailed as 'the\r\nsoldier's friend'--a compliment which no soldier would be likely to\r\nutter concerning a commander who had not taken the right method to\r\nrender himself the object of general affection--began to attract\r\nunenviable notoriety at the beginning of 1809. On January 27 Colonel\r\nWardle charged the Duke with corrupt administration of the Half-Pay\r\nFund, the sole control of this provision having been vested in the\r\nCommander-in-Chief.\r\n\r\nThe produce of the fund arose from the sale of commissions fallen in\r\nby the death or dismissal of officers in the army, and amounts thus\r\nrealised were applied to the purchase of commissions for meritorious\r\nofficers, and other beneficial purposes.\r\n\r\nColonel Wardle stated he should prove that the Duke of York had a\r\nmistress, Mrs. Clarke, living in great splendour in Gloucester Place,\r\nfrom 1803 to 1806. This lady had a scale of prices for the sale of\r\ncommissions, and he would lay before the House Mrs. Clarke's prices and\r\nthe Regulation prices.\r\n\r\n                 Mrs. Clarke's    Regulation\r\n                    Prices.

He then made\r\na statement of a list of sales effected by her, the sums paid, the\r\nnames and ranks of the officers, a list of exchanges, &c.\r\n\r\nHer patronage, it was stated, extended also to ecclesiastics. He moved\r\nfor a Committee of the whole House to investigate the subject. The\r\nmotion was agreed to, and the witnesses were ordered to be summoned.\r\n\r\nOn February 1, Mrs. Clarke stood at the bar of the House--a lovely\r\nThaïs, eminently self-possessed, armed with ready wit, and with charms\r\nof person and address which dazzled the gravest members. She contrived\r\nto turn all questions put to her with the object of giving annoyance,\r\nor for her degradation, into the means of exposing the Duke of York,\r\nwho, it appears, had withdrawn his 'protection,' stipulating to pay her\r\nan annuity of 400_l._ per annum, which had been suffered to fall into\r\narrears, and her applications for payment had been met with threats of\r\nthe 'pillory' and the 'Bastille.'\r\n\r\nWilberforce, who, as we have seen, had been active in bringing\r\nforward the impeachment of Lord Melville, for corruption in his\r\noffice, when at the Admiralty, as far as misappropriation of the Navy\r\nFund was concerned; and Whitbread, who, as a leader of the Radical\r\nReformers, was foremost in exposing state intrigues and corruptions at\r\nCourt--were active in bringing forward and proving the case against the\r\nCommander-in-Chief.\r\n\r\nWilberforce has made the following entry in his diary, touching the\r\ninvestigation before the Parliamentary Committee: 'This melancholy\r\nbusiness will do irreparable mischief to public morals, by accustoming\r\nthe public to hear without emotion shameless violations of decency. The\r\nHouse examining Mrs. Clarke for two hours, cross-examining her in the\r\nOld Bailey way, she, elegantly dressed, consummately impudent and very\r\nclever, got clearly the better of the tussle.'\r\n\r\nTwo officers who endeavoured to shield their chief during the\r\ninvestigation by giving evidence contrary to the truth, were committed\r\nto Newgate for equivocation.\r\n\r\nAfter an examination which lasted some while, during which facts\r\ndamaging to both sides were elicited, while Mrs. Clarke's allegations\r\nremained unshaken in the main, Colonel Wardle summed up the evidence,\r\nand concluded by moving 'that the Duke of York had been guilty of\r\ncorrupt practices and connivance. He accordingly prayed for his\r\ndismissal from the command of the army.'\r\n\r\nMr. Banks moved an amendment acquitting the Duke of York of personal\r\ncorruption, but petitioning the King to remove him for gross\r\nirregularities and negligence.\r\n\r\nMr. Percival moved and carried a resolution absolving the Duke of all\r\npersonal corruption or criminal connivance.\r\n\r\nIt was evident that the resignation of the Commander-in-Chief would\r\nalone stop further proceedings. Wilberforce and his party succeeded in\r\nforcing him to retire from the command of the army, and the inquiry was\r\ndropped.\r\n\r\nSir David Dundas succeeded the Duke of York, and after holding the\r\nappointment for two years, resigned, and the Duke was reinstated.\r\n\r\nMrs. Clarke was not appeased by the results of the parliamentary\r\ninvestigation, which had, in fact, effected nothing for her, and\r\nall for others. These disgraceful exposures would have been escaped\r\nif the Duke had paid her annuity. Her motives in the matter were of\r\ncourse entirely personal; the public were on her side, and she made\r\nthe notoriety serve her purpose. She announced a _Memoir of her Life_,\r\nand of her transactions with the Duke of York, accompanied by a series\r\nof his letters; these latter would have been eagerly read, the fervid\r\nspecimens which came out in the course of the investigation were\r\nrepublished, versified, and circulated in various forms, to the delight\r\nof the public. The consequences, and the ridicule apprehended from\r\nthis exposure, effected the purpose which a mere regard for good faith\r\ncould not accomplish: negotiations were opened for the suppression\r\nand destruction of these memoirs, which were said to be actually in\r\nprint. An indemnity of 7,000_l._ is believed to have secured Mrs.\r\nClarke's silence, and the annuity of 400_l._ was guaranteed her for\r\nlife. This outline of the facts will be found substantially followed\r\nby the caricaturist's series, although the details differ in certain\r\nrespects from over-colouring inseparable from satirical versions. Mrs.\r\nClarke[12] stated that she had been under the protection of the Duke of\r\nYork since the years 1802 or 1803, but her establishment in Gloucester\r\nPlace did not commence till 1804; it consisted of two carriages, eight\r\nhorses, nine men servants, &c., to defray the expenses of which the\r\nDuke allowed her 2,000_l._ per annum, to be paid monthly. That she\r\nhad also a small establishment at Weybridge; the house belonged to\r\nHis Royal Highness. That the sums she received from the Duke were\r\nbarely adequate to pay the servants their wages and liveries; and\r\nwhen she informed him of it, he replied that 'if she were clever, she\r\nwould not ask him for money.' That the applications for her interest\r\nin military promotions were very numerous; she mentioned them to His\r\nRoyal Highness, who told her which were likely to be successful. At one\r\nperiod she had a long list of applicants, procured either by Captain\r\nSandon or Mr. Donovan, which she gave his Royal Highness, who said\r\nhe would procure the appointments by degrees; she stated to him at\r\nthe same time the sums which she should receive for her interest in\r\nprocuring them; that the appointment of Mr. Dowler to the Commissariat\r\nwas through the influence of the Duke of York, who knew that she was to\r\nreceive 1,000_l._ for it. That two applications were made through the\r\nmedium of Mr. Donovan, for promotions in the Church, one for a deanery,\r\nthe other a bishopric; and Dr. O'Meara, who expected one of them,\r\napplied to her for a letter of introduction to His Royal Highness. That\r\nthe Duke was fully acquainted with the extent of her establishment as\r\nhe visited her every day; paid some incidental debts which she had\r\nincurred; but, at the time of separation, had not made any advances of\r\ncash for three months, and, in consequence, left her involved more than\r\n2,000_l._ in debt. She resided in Gloucester Place about three years.\r\n\r\nMrs. Clarke also stated that she obtained for Major Shaw the\r\nappointment of Deputy Barrack-Master-General of the Cape of Good Hope,\r\nfor which he was to pay her 1,000_l._; she, however, only received\r\n500_l._, and, on complaining to His Royal Highness, he warned her to\r\nbe more careful, and not to suffer herself to be duped again, adding\r\nthat he would put Major Shaw on half-pay. Major Shaw sent her several\r\nletters in consequence, complaining of being put upon half-pay, but she\r\npaid no attention to them.\r\n\r\nMrs. Clarke also stated that she had in her service as footman, a young\r\nman, named Samuel Carter; he lived with her about twelve months, and\r\nwas in the habit of attending upon her when in company with the Duke of\r\nYork. She at length obtained for him a commission in the 16th Foot, by\r\napplying to the Duke, who conversed with him on the occasion. At the\r\ntime of the investigation he was a staff officer in the West Indies.\r\nCarter was recommended to her by Captain Sutton, and was indebted to\r\nher alone for his commission.\r\n\r\nIt appeared from later disclosures that this Carter, who was by\r\nno means a person without education, was the natural son of the\r\ndeceased Captain Sutton, a most meritorious officer, and a personal\r\nfriend of the Prince's, and that his son's appointment was an act of\r\nwell-deserved benevolence. Carter's age at the date of his appointment\r\nwas, according to Mrs. Clarke's account, about eighteen, but on account\r\nof his short stature he looked a mere boy.\r\n\r\nMrs. Clarke was asked whether she intended to abide by the statement\r\nof her having pinned up at the head of the bed a list of the friends\r\nwhom she wished to be promoted, and which list the Duke of York took\r\naway? She answered affirmatively, and said that His Royal Highness\r\ntook it down the second morning, drew up the curtain, and read it. She\r\nafterwards saw it in His Royal Highness's pocket-book, with scratches\r\nthrough several of the names of those who had been promoted.\r\n\r\nMiss Mary Ann Taylor, who was in the habit of visiting Mrs. Clarke,\r\nwhen she was under the Duke's protection, very frequently, stated that\r\nshe heard the Duke of York speak to Mrs. Clarke about Colonel French's\r\nlevy, and that what passed, as nearly as she could recollect, was as\r\nfollows. 'I am continually worried by Colonel French. He worries me\r\ncontinually about the levy business, and is always wanting something\r\nmore in his own favour.' Turning then to Mrs. Clarke (Miss T. thinks),\r\nhe said, 'How does he behave to you, darling?' or some such kind words\r\nas he was wont to use. Mrs. Clarke replied, 'Middling; not very well;'\r\non which the Duke said, 'Master French must mind what he is about, or I\r\nshall cut him up and his levy too!'[13]\r\n\r\nLarge sums, it is certain, had been supplied by the Duke to his\r\nmistress--upwards of 5,000_l._ in notes, and in payments to tradesmen\r\nfor wine, furniture, and a variety of articles, to the amount, in the\r\nwhole, of between 16,000_l._ and 17,000_l._, and all within the space\r\nof little more than two years. The extent of Mrs. Clarke's debts was\r\nlikewise to be considered.[14]\r\n\r\n_Mrs. Clarke's Memoirs._--Mrs. Clarke called on Sir Richard Phillips\r\nfor the purpose of making some arrangement respecting the publication\r\nof her _Memoirs_; this offer was declined for several reasons of a\r\nprivate and political nature: the unqualified reproaches to which\r\nSir Richard Phillips had lately been exposed had probably taught him\r\nsome lessons of reserve, or at least he did not choose to expose\r\nhimself to public notice as the publisher of a work which was likely\r\nto create much political interest, at least while the novelty of the\r\nthing lasted. Though this gentleman declined to become the purchaser\r\nof Mrs. Clarke's MS., he promised to recommend her to a publisher, who\r\nwould treat her justly and liberally. At the same time, Sir Richard\r\ntold Mrs. Clarke he conceived if she could obtain the arrears of her\r\nannuity from the Duke, and a legal settlement for the payment of it\r\nin future, together with the payment of all debts contracted during\r\nher late connection with His Royal Highness, it would better answer\r\nher purpose to suppress the publication altogether. To this reasonable\r\nproposition Mrs. Clarke consented; negotiations were opened with the\r\nCommander-in-Chief's advisers, and a projected plan of accommodation\r\nmade known. This was followed by a string of propositions on the other\r\nside, which were drawn up, and assented to by Mrs. Clarke, and the\r\nfamous threatened _Memoirs_ of this lady, 'written by herself,' were\r\nconsigned to the flames on the premises of Mr. Gillet, the printer, of\r\nSalisbury Square.\r\n\r\nEighteen thousand copies, with the perusal of which the country was to\r\nhave been indulged, were actually destroyed, and the entire publication\r\nwas effectually suppressed. Besides destroying the _Memoirs_ Mrs.\r\nClarke gave up ninety private letters, containing, it is said,\r\nanecdotes of illustrious and noble personages, of the most curious\r\ndescription.\r\n\r\n_April 29._--'Mrs. Clarke's _Memoirs_ are said to have been suppressed,\r\nin consequence of her receiving 7,000_l._ down, and an annuity of\r\n400_l._ for her own life, and an annuity of 200_l._ each for her\r\nrespective daughters, with a promise that her son shall be provided\r\nfor. The printer of the work has also received 500_l._ of the\r\nindemnification money.'[15]\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to discriminate between the alleged motives of Colonel\r\nWardle's action and his real object; public spirit was the mainspring\r\nwhich directed the mover of the investigation, if we may trust his own\r\naccount, and for awhile the populace seems to have been of the same\r\nopinion, as addresses of thanks from various corporations acknowledged\r\nhis patriotism. Somewhat later his disinterestedness began to be\r\nquestioned; then the ugly evidence of the house at Westbourne Place\r\nwas found difficult to argue away.[16] The absence of Major Dodd and\r\nMr. Glennie at the action--where their presence was of the utmost\r\nimportance--brought against the Colonel by one Wright, an upholsterer,\r\nto recover the expenses of furnishing this house, looked suspicious;\r\nthe evidence was against the plaintiff, and Wardle was cast in the\r\nsuit, and had to pay 2,000_l._ and costs.\r\n\r\nIn the course of the trial it began to be hinted that the chief\r\ninstigator of these proceedings was no less than a royal Duke, the\r\nbrother of the Commander-in-Chief.\r\n\r\nIt seems tolerably clear, on sifting the motives of the several actors\r\nand puppets in this matter, who had personally nothing to gain by the\r\nDuke's dismissal, and who were obviously, with one or two exceptions,\r\ncorrupt agents in the first instance by their own confessions, and\r\ntherefore likely to be actuated by no higher principles in the\r\nproceedings at issue, that they were (involuntarily in some cases)\r\nexposing their own misdeeds to forward the purpose of a greater\r\npersonage, who did not appear, but to whose influence and purse they\r\nlooked for their reward.\r\n\r\nMrs. Clarke was, as everyone recognised, acting from the common\r\nimpulse of personal aggrandisement, and she frankly acknowledged her\r\nprinciples. The year following the investigation, and the destruction\r\nof her _Memoirs_, she thought proper to revenge the want of faith\r\nwhich, according to her account, had characterised the proceedings of\r\nthe 'conspirators' in her own case, by exposing the true intentions\r\nof the Duke's assailants; her motives, as she admitted, were in this\r\nsecond exposure prompted by the same interested spirit which had\r\nactuated the previous prosecution of her late friend and protector.\r\n\r\nAccording to her account Colonel Wardle was simply a tool in the hands\r\nof the Duke of Kent; his allies were Major Dodd and Mr. Glennie, the\r\nformer being the Duke of Kent's secretary--who engaged himself without\r\nscruple to forward the projects of his employer. According to all\r\naccounts Colonel Wardle had bribed the assistance of an ambitious\r\nwoman who fancied herself aggrieved, and who was, above all, amenable\r\nto sordid incentives: the Duke had left her in debt, had broken his\r\nword in more than one instance, and had used threats of the pillory\r\nand the Bastille in reply to her applications; she was tired of living\r\nin obscure retirement, and was irritated by the menaces of creditors,\r\nwhose demands she had no means of satisfying. The chief temptation held\r\nout to her was, however, a promise that she should once more enjoy\r\nthat command of ease, and power of shining in the world of fashion,\r\nwhich had been Mrs. Clarke's weakness through life. The arrears she\r\nclaimed were to be made up, her debts were to be paid, the allowance\r\nshe sought from the Duke of York (400_l_. per annum), was to be\r\ndoubled by his brother; she was to have a carriage and four, with a\r\nresidence and state in proportion; and she was to exercise her own\r\ntaste in furnishing a house with the elegance and splendour which had\r\nmarked her late establishment at Gloucester Place. To do the lady\r\njustice, she hesitated before inflicting the grave injuries which\r\nmust attend the public exposure of her whilom benefactor, although\r\nshe was by no means habitually given to sentimentality. She wrote to\r\nthe Commander-in-Chief, asked for the allowance which, as she avowed,\r\nshe had done nothing to forfeit, and at the same time mentioned the\r\novertures which two factions were making her: one party for political\r\npurposes--the Radical Reformers to wit, headed by Sir Francis Burdett\r\n(who she declared had proposed to treat for the papers and letters in\r\nher possession, some sixty of which, as she informed the Duke, were\r\nin his own handwriting); the other influence brought to bear on her\r\nwas of a more subtle and covert description, and she went so far as to\r\nindicate the disastrous consequences to himself which would inevitably\r\nfollow if she lent herself to the schemes of his personal antagonists.\r\n\r\nThe Duke of York remained obdurate, and thus played into the hands\r\nof his personal and political enemies. Colonel Wardle seized the\r\nopportunity. He gave Mrs. Clarke 100_l_. for present necessities, to\r\ninduce reliance in those liberal promises which were later repudiated.\r\nThe lady's natural sagacity, and her experience of life, furnished\r\nher with strategic abilities almost equal to the combined talents of\r\nthe respective factions between which she found herself; and on the\r\nstrength of the assistance which she finally consented to afford to\r\nColonel Wardle and his supporters through Major Dodd--who, though\r\nless seen, was the more active agent in organising the attack on the\r\nCommander-in-Chief--she secured the house in Westbourne Place as an\r\nearnest of the benefits she was to receive hereafter, and succeeded\r\nin making Colonel Wardle become security for the furniture. In her\r\ndisappointment it must have proved at least somewhat of a consolation\r\nto have out-manoeuvred the Colonel; who, for his reward, reaped in\r\nthe end the obloquy attending exposure and ridicule instead of the\r\nglorification which at first appeared likely to crown his exertions.\r\nThus the combination was successfully set in motion, and, in spite of\r\nall its discordant elements, compelled to work with something like\r\nconsistent unison, or its individual members were left to take the\r\nconsequences of any attempted retrogression, as in the instances of\r\nCaptain Sandon (Mrs. Clarke's ally), on the one hand, and General\r\nClavering,[17] whose sympathies were with his chief, on the other. The\r\nopponents of the Duke of York were thus prepared to open the campaign\r\nin the manner we have seen.\r\n\r\nIn 1810 Mrs. Clarke took up her pen to endeavour to prove that the Duke\r\nof York's fall was actually brought about by the successful ingenuity\r\nand masterly tactics of his brother the Duke of Kent. In a pamphlet\r\nentitled _The Rival Princes_ she argued there was feud between the two\r\nDukes, a fact which was sufficiently accepted out of doors, before\r\nthe appearance of her publication, and that of the refutation which\r\nfollowed it under the title of _The Rival Dukes_. It will be remembered\r\nthat early in 1802 the Duke of Kent obtained the governorship of\r\nGibraltar, and that when possessed of the supreme command he determined\r\nto introduce all the rigour of German discipline, in accordance with\r\nthe school in which he had received his military education. His efforts\r\nto remodel the existing regulations, and to substitute a system of\r\nseverer subordination and rigid restraint, were not attended with\r\nauspicious results; on the contrary, a mutiny took place, December 24,\r\n1803, in which, it is said, the Governor's life was actually aimed\r\nat. On this occasion several officers distinguished themselves by\r\ntheir zeal and activity; while the timely arrival of a detachment of\r\nartillery under Captain Dodd, not only endeared that officer to his\r\nroyal highness through the remainder of his life, but contributed not\r\na little to restore order in the garrison. The Duke of Kent was soon\r\nafter recalled, and although he requested that the Commander-in-Chief\r\nshould hold a court-martial on his conduct, the Duke of York declined\r\nto sanction the proceedings--Mrs. Clarke alleged out of fraternal\r\nkindness, as he declared to her, that if he had acceded to his\r\nbrother's wishes, the Duke of Kent would certainly have been dismissed,\r\nwhich would have resulted in the loss of his emoluments, and this would\r\nhave occasioned a reduction of some 2,000_l._ per annum in his income,\r\nat a time too when he was in sufficiently straitened circumstances.\r\n\r\nFrom the date of his return his royal highness remained unemployed, and\r\nall efforts to obtain a restoration to his governorship, or attain any\r\ncommand in the army, proved unavailing, although he had received the\r\nbaton of a field-marshal in 1805.\r\n\r\nBetween the Commander-in-Chief and his brother a jealousy had for\r\nsome time subsisted, and Mrs. Clarke did not hesitate to state that\r\nthe intrigue to which she had been induced to lend herself as the\r\nmost conspicuous figure, was prompted by a desire on the part of the\r\nprincipal agitator--who remained discreetly in the background--to\r\nhumiliate the Duke of York, in the expectation that the office of\r\nCommander-in-Chief, vacated by his brother's dismissal, would descend\r\non himself in the natural order of things: an expectation which was\r\nnot realised. One wild surmise attributed to 'the party' the belief\r\nthat the Duke of York, smarting under his disgrace, would commit\r\nsuicide, and thus afford the Duke of Kent a chance of being appointed\r\nhis successor, as in the event of his brother's decease, there seems\r\nlittle doubt that the Duke of Kent, in spite of certain prejudices\r\nagainst which he struggled through his prematurely closed life, would\r\nhave filled the office, almost by family right. The character of the\r\nDuke of Kent has been dispassionately reviewed since that date, and\r\nthe calumnies of his detractors disallowed; beyond a natural leaning\r\nto discipline pushed to severity, through the fruits of his training,\r\nit is clear that his disposition was remarkably free from the guilty\r\npersonal weaknesses which marked his age, and from those unrestrained\r\nself-indulgences which disfigured many of the brightest luminaries of\r\nthe last century in nearly every phase of society.\r\n\r\nIt will perhaps be interesting, after having thus attempted to trace\r\nthe involutions of this complicated and scandalous intrigue, which,\r\nhowever, belongs to history, to add a word on the ultimate careers of\r\nthe principal actors. Mrs. Clarke chiefly spent her later years in\r\nParis, where it is understood she died, leaving a fortune amounting to\r\nsome thousands of pounds. It is a redeeming point in her character,\r\nthat when a certain nobleman (best known by the fictitious title of\r\nthe 'Marquis of Steyne,' under which he figures in a famous novel,\r\nperhaps the finest in the world), presuming on the reputation of\r\nthe mother, made princely overtures, with the object of converting\r\none of her daughters--who, we are informed, were unusually handsome\r\nyoung ladies--into his mistress, the proposal was treated with the\r\nindignation its nature merited.\r\n\r\nMr. Clarke, who was by no means the sinner, according to another\r\naccount which has reached us, that his detractors have painted, became\r\nfor a time, as we learn, a Brother of the Charter House. He lived to a\r\nvery venerable age; and he, too, from the circumstances of his family,\r\nwas able to leave some property at his decease.\r\n\r\nThe majority of caricatures published by Rowlandson in 1809 relate,\r\nas we have already said, to the Clarke Scandal. The exposures which\r\nattended this connection, and the action taken by the members of the\r\nOpposition in consequence of the disclosures of abuses of influence\r\nwhich came out in course of the investigation, occasioned the Duke\r\nof York to resign his office as head of the army, a temporary\r\nconcession rendered unavoidable, it appeared, under the circumstances.\r\nThe satirical prints put forth to hold up to ridicule the various\r\ncompromising revelations which marked the progress of the Parliamentary\r\nexamination of witnesses formed a series by themselves. Thomas Tegg who\r\nissued the greater part of these plates, thought proper to bring out a\r\nfrontispiece or title-page to the collection, which our artist etched,\r\nfor the purpose, on March 27, 1809. The design of this introductory\r\nprint is arranged as a screen, on which is the lettering: '_Tegg's\r\ncomplete Collection of Caricatures relative to Mrs. Clarke, and the\r\ncircumstances arising from the Investigation of the Conduct of His\r\nRoyal Highness the Duke of York before the House of Commons,_ 1809--'\r\n\r\n    OUT OF EVIL COMETH GOOD--\r\n    Learn to be wise from others' harm,\r\n    And thou shalt do full well.\r\n\r\nOn the ground is a book open at the Commandment, 'Thou shalt not\r\ncommit adultery,' and beside lie the Duke's letters to his lady-love,\r\nbeginning, 'My darling, dearest dear,' &c. Mrs. Clarke and Colonel\r\nWardle, the pair made most conspicuous during the enquiry, are\r\nstanding on pedestals, placed at either extremity, and drawing back\r\nthe curtains. The mitre and crozier of the Duke, as Prince Bishop\r\nof Osnaburgh, crossed by his long sword and the military cocked-hat\r\nappertaining to his official position, as Commander-in-Chief of the\r\narmy, form an appropriate trophy, arranged above the proscenium.\r\n\r\n_February 15, 1809._ _Dissolution of Partnership, or the Industrious\r\nMrs. Clarke Winding up her Accounts._ Published by T. Tegg,\r\nCheapside.--Above the heads of the principal performers in this scene\r\nis engraved the well-known quotation from Gay's 'Beggar's Opera':--\r\n\r\n    'Tis woman that seduces all mankind;\r\n      By her we first are taught the wheedling arts;\r\n    Her very eyes can cheat when most she's kind.\r\n      She tricks us of our money with our hearts:\r\n    For her, like wolves, by night we rove for prey,\r\n      And practise every fraud to bribe her charms;\r\n    For suits of love, like law, are won by pay,\r\n      And beauty must be fee'd into our arms.\r\n\r\nMrs. Clarke is seated on a 'rickety chair,' with a 'Morocco bottom;' at\r\nher feet are the tender epistles of her admirer: 'My love, my life, I\r\ncannot exist without you;' 'My admirable angel;' 'My dear pretty little\r\ndarling,' &c.; the lady is holding her lap for a bag of gold (800_l._)\r\nwhich a stout old party is handing her in exchange for her good\r\noffices, relative to the promotion of a scarecrow in military uniform,\r\nprobably his son, seated in an 'easy chair,' with a paper at his feet\r\ninscribed likewise from Gay's 'Newgate Pastoral':--\r\n\r\n    'Tis so pat to all the tribe,\r\n    Each cries, 'That was levelled at me!'\r\n\r\nMrs. Clarke's boudoir is indicated behind; the portrait of 'Frederick'\r\nis hanging therein, and below it is pinned a 'list of candidates\r\nfor promotion.

Published by T. Tegg, Cheapside.--The interest of this frail\r\ndispenser of patronage was not confined to the army, it was extended\r\nto the Church. In the course of the disclosures it was shown that a\r\ncertain Doctor O'Meara had secured, through her offices, and for a\r\nconsideration, the privilege of preaching before Royalty--an equivocal\r\nroad to preferment, on the nature of which the caricaturists were\r\nespecially playful, as succeeding prints will elucidate. Mrs. Clarke is\r\nseen, standing in semi-royal state, under a canopy, and holding a levee\r\nof interested applicants: military officers, of various grades, are\r\nbowing before the fair patroness; a Church dignitary, openly provided\r\nwith the needful (800_l._ in a money-bag), and 'cits' who are willing\r\nto treat for the advantage of having their sons converted into officers\r\nand gentlemen. Mrs. Clarke is candidly rehearsing the terms on which\r\nbusiness may be transacted at her establishment; the conditions are\r\nsufficiently plausible:--\r\n\r\n    Ye Captains and ye Colonels--ye Parsons wanting place,\r\n    Advice I'll give you gratis, and think upon your case.\r\n    If there is possibility for you I'll raise the dust;\r\n    But then you must excuse me--if I serve myself the first.\r\n\r\n_February 20, 1809._ _The Ambassador of Morocco on a Special\r\nEmbassy._--In such delicate transactions as Mrs. Clarke carried on at\r\nGloucester Place, where the Duke had set up an elegant establishment\r\nfor her use, the intermediary of third parties was essential. Among the\r\naccommodating persons whose names were brought to light in the course\r\nof the proceedings, as acting in the capacity of 'go-betweens,' was a\r\ncertain 'Emperor of Morocco,' as he was styled in the correspondence,\r\nbut who, in sober reality, was a ladies' shoemaker, one Taylor, of Bond\r\nStreet.\r\n\r\nThe print represents this mysterious plenipotentiary, with private\r\ncorrespondence in his hand, hurrying up to Mrs. Clarke's handsomely\r\nfurnished mansion; the lady, who is at the open window on the look-out\r\nfor her envoy, is crying, 'Open the door, John; here comes the\r\nAmbassador. Now for the dear delightful answer.' John Bull, with his\r\ndog by his side, who has apparently formed a suspicion of the Emperor's\r\nerrand, is enquiring, 'I say, Master Shoemaker, where be you going in\r\nsuch a woundy hurry?' To which the bustling confidential agent replies,\r\n'Don't speak to me, fellow; you should never pry into State affairs.'\r\n\r\n_February 24, 1809._ _Days of Prosperity in Gloucester Place, or a\r\nKept Mistress in High Feather._ Published by T. Tegg.--'Money was\r\nexpended upon her footmen, chariots, musicians, singers, players,\r\ndancers, parasites, pimps, and bawds. But in the end the money of the\r\npeople.'--_Vide_ Cobbett, _Annual Register_. A scene of coarse and\r\nindiscriminate revelry is represented proceeding in Mrs. Clarke's\r\ndrawing-room; a round table is covered with wines, spirits, punchbowls,\r\nand, among the rich dessert dishes, is a gigantic golden bowl, the\r\nthankoffering of a Bishop. The diversions of the company assembled have\r\npassed the bounds of innocent recreation; fiddlers and singers are\r\nrolling on the floor, wine and punch are recklessly thrown about the\r\nplace, and altogether the spectacle is not of an improving character. A\r\ntroop of flunkeys, in expensive liveries, are helping themselves from\r\nthe decanters and laughing at the tipsy antics of the company.\r\n\r\n_February 26, 1809._ _All for Love. A Scene at Weymouth._--The\r\nDuke's most affectionate epistles were dated from Weymouth, and the\r\ncaricaturist has drawn the stout commander seated at table there,\r\npen in hand, filled with rapture at the prospect of returning to his\r\nDelilah: 'To-morrow I inspect my regiment, and then for my dearest,\r\ndearest, dearest love!' Unfinished love-letters are scattered around:\r\n'Oh, love is the cause of my folly!' 'My amiable girl!' 'My dearest\r\ndear, I hope to be in your arms,' &c. The Duke's black footboy, who is\r\nstanding staring in amazement at the rhapsodising hero his master, is\r\ninclined to moralise over the Duke's follies: 'Bless my massa! what be\r\nthe matter with him? Him in love, I fear. Sambo once be in love with\r\nbad woman, but him repent!' On the same plate is a second subject,\r\nentitled--\r\n\r\n_February 26, 1809._ _An Unexpected Meeting._--An elderly officer is\r\namazed at running across the figure of Mrs. Clarke's footboy, strutting\r\nin his uniform as bold as the best. 'Can I believe my eyes? Why, this\r\nis the little footboy who waited on us at the house of a lady of a\r\ncertain description!' The promoted favourite is highly indignant at\r\nthis allusion to the past: 'I beg, sir, you will not come for to go to\r\naffront a gemman!'\r\n\r\n_February 26, 1809._ _The Bishop and his Clarke._ Published by T. Tegg,\r\n111 Cheapside.--The reverend Bishop of Osnabrück has laid aside his\r\ncrozier and mitre and assumed the nightcap of domestic retirement. By\r\nhis side is the notorious Clarke, who is reminding her companion of\r\ncertain promises: 'Only remember the promotions I mentioned; I have\r\npinned up the _list_ at the head of the bed.' To which the Duke of York\r\nis tenderly responding, 'Ask anything in reason, and you shall have it,\r\nmy dearest love!' The list of promotions includes 'A Bishopric for Dr.\r\nO'Leary,' 'A Commissariat for Dicky Dowlas,' and other items, down to a\r\npost for the lady's footboy. It was stated by Mrs. Clarke, during the\r\nproceedings, that the Duke had assured her 'that as his favourite she\r\nhad far more influence than the Oueen.'\r\n\r\n_February 27, 1809._ _A Pilgrimage from Surrey to Gloucester Place, or\r\nthe Bishop in an Ecstasy._ Published by T. Tegg.--The Duke of York,\r\narrayed in his canonicals as Prince Bishop of Osnabrück, has turned his\r\nback on his mansion and on his wife; he has travelled a long stride\r\nupon the 'road to destruction' and passed the 'stumbling-block' on his\r\npath. He is trampling under foot 'Thoughts on Connubial Happiness' and\r\nthe Commandments, and is just turning the corner of Gloucester Place,\r\nsaying, 'Now for a meeting with my dearest dear.' Mrs. Clarke and a\r\nfemale friend are looking out of window, and signalling the Duke's\r\narrival. Various placards are pasted on the house of his mistress: 'To\r\nall.--Journeymen Taylors wanted,' 'Man traps are placed every night on\r\nthese premises,' 'Diamonds by Mrs. Clarke, Lapidary to His Highness;'\r\n'Agency Office; business transacted on moderate terms;' 'This evening\r\nwill be performed \"Duke and no Duke,\" by His Majesty's servants,' &c.\r\n\r\n_February 29, 1809._ _The York_[18] _Magician Transforming a Footboy\r\ninto a Captain._ Published by T. Tegg.--The Commander-in-Chief has\r\nassumed the white beard, fur cap, and robes of a magician; he is waving\r\na magic wand, 'Petticoat Influence,' over Mrs. Clarke's late footboy,\r\nwho is rising transformed into a captain, and filled with astonishment\r\nat the rapidity of the performance. The Duke is made to say, 'By the\r\nmystery of my art, no more be a footboy, but rise a captain!'\r\n\r\n_March 2, 1809._ _A Parliamentary Toast._ Published by T. Tegg.--A\r\ncompany, consisting principally of army officers, have been dining; the\r\nwine is on the table. 'Come, Jack, favour with a toast.' The chairman\r\nis standing on his legs to do honour to his toast: 'Here is the lady\r\nthat can raise five hundred!' Another gallant gentleman is anxiously\r\nenquiring of his neighbour, 'How much did you give to be gazetted?' The\r\nanswer, given with a disconsolate air, is, 'Five hundred hard cash!' A\r\nlistener is remarking, 'I did not think it would have been done up so\r\nsoon. I had promised at least a dozen promotions!'\r\n\r\n_March 4, 1809._ _Chelsea Parade, or a Croaking Member Surveying the\r\nInside, Outside, and Backside of Mrs. Clarke's Premises._ Published\r\nby T. Tegg.--The front door of Mrs. Clarke's establishment, 'Warren\r\nStreet.' The door is inscribed, 'Knock, and you shall enter.' A\r\nnotice-board, hung out sign-fashion, bears the quotation: 'All the\r\nworld's a stage, and men and women merely players. Some play the\r\nupper, some the under part, but chief play that most foreign to their\r\nheart.' Colonel Wardle, wrapped in his military cloak, and indicating\r\ndiscretion, with his finger on his lips, is handing a bag of money to\r\na waiting-maid and saying, 'You understand me,' to which the favourite\r\nis replying with an assurance 'that the Colonel's business shall be\r\nattended to.' Mrs. Clarke, leaning out of window, is overlooking her\r\nvisitor and crying, 'Though not in love, enter quick, my guardian\r\nangel, my sweet Widdle-Waddle.' Mr. Croker, ensconced in 'Prospect\r\nPlace,' opposite, as the 'croaking member,' spyglass in hand, is\r\nsurveying the position of affairs from an attic marked, 'Peeping Tom's\r\nObservatory;' he is exclaiming, 'Oh, the devil choke her! he's Waddling\r\nin, as I'm a prying Croaker.' A discomfited group of ex-favourites\r\nare hurrying off as quickly as possible. The Duke of York, with mitre\r\nand crozier, a cope worn over his uniform, and bearing a label on his\r\nstole: 'Men have their entrances and their exits,' cries, 'To part\r\nwith my dear, and not allow four hundred a year.' His lawyer, Adam,\r\nby his side, cries, 'Alas, alas! all flesh is grass--so said Adam,\r\nmy forefather;' and Doctor O'Meara, bringing up the rear, in great\r\ntribulation, is moaning, 'O me, Leary! O me, Leary! who once made\r\nRoyalty melt into tears--am now become a sniveller.'\r\n\r\n_March 5, 1809._ _The Road to Preferment--through Clarke's Passage._\r\nPublished by T. Tegg.--Mrs. Clarke, wearing a general's uniform above\r\nher skirts, is standing at the entrance to a wide thoroughfare, marked\r\n'Clarke's Passage.' There is a stampede to gain admission--officers,\r\ndandies, old fogeys, parsons with money-bags, fathers and sons--the\r\nhalt and the lame, the gouty and disabled, are all flocking in crowds,\r\nready to pay for the accommodation,--but in vain. The arbitress of\r\npromotions and easy advancements is declaring, 'Gentlemen, it is no\r\nuse to rush on in this manner; the principal places have been disposed\r\nof these three weeks; and I assure you at present there is not even\r\nstanding room.'\r\n\r\n_March 5, 1809._ _The York March._ Published by T. Tegg.--The stout\r\nDuke of York has turned his sturdy back on his fair enslaver,\r\ndeclaring, 'If I must march, I must; however, I shall leave my\r\nBaggage behind me!' The principal cause of the exposure may be laid\r\nto the Duke's account. He declined, as has been mentioned, to keep\r\nhis word in respect to an allowance of four hundred a year, which,\r\nthere appears no doubt, he had promised to make the lady, if her\r\nconduct, after his desertion, was such as to merit his approval. Mrs.\r\nClarke, who is dressed precisely as she appeared at the bar of the\r\nHouse of Commons,[19] is thus reproaching the York deserter: 'O you\r\ngay deceiver, to leave a poor woman without _protection_!' The storm\r\nwhich was raised during the enquiry into the abuses of privilege in\r\nthe administration of the army and Half-Pay Fund, and threatened to\r\ndeprive the Duke of his office as Commander-in-Chief, only hardened\r\nhis resolution to do nothing for this Ariadne, who, however, to do her\r\njustice, showed herself well able to defend her own interests, and to\r\npay back her defamers in their own coin.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE YORK MARCH.]\r\n\r\n_March 7, 1809._ _The Triumvirate of Gloucester Place, or the Clarke,\r\nthe Soldier, and the Taylor._ Published by T. Tegg.\r\n\r\n    John Gilpin said, 'Of womankind\r\n      I only love but one,\r\n    And thou art she, my dearest dear;\r\n      Therefore it shall be done.'--_Vide_ 'John Gilpin.'\r\n\r\n--The Duke of York is seated at table, on which is wine and dessert,\r\nplaced between Mrs. Mary Ann Clarke and her friend and _confidante_,\r\nMiss Taylor. The Duke's favourite is holding out her 'List of\r\nPromotions,' entered upon a tremendous roll of papers, which seems\r\nto be endless. 'I have a small list of promotions which I wish to\r\nbe filled up immediately, my dearest!' To which modest request this\r\nweak-minded Samson is readily giving his assent: 'It shall be done, my\r\ndarling!'\r\n\r\n_March 8, 1809._ _A Scene from the Tragedy of 'Cato.'_ Published by\r\nT. Tegg.--Two Britons are meeting, wearing the most solemn aspect,\r\nindicating occurrences of portentous gravity. One of the pair is a\r\ncobbler, above whose stall is the figure of an anchor and the words,\r\n'Hope--Insurance Office.' His friend is reciting with terrific\r\nintensity these lines:--\r\n\r\n    The dawn is overcast--the morning lours,\r\n    And heavily in clouds brings in the day--\r\n    Big with the fate of York and Mrs. Clarke.\r\n\r\n_March 8, 1809._ _Yorkshire Hieroglyphics._ Plate 1. Published by T.\r\nTegg.--The hieroglyphics are not very difficult to decipher, and when\r\ntranscribed prove nothing more than a compromising letter, which was\r\nproduced in the House of Commons, incautiously sent by the amorous\r\nCommander-in-Chief to his lady-love five years previously:--\r\n\r\n           _The Duke of York's first letter to Mrs. Clarke._\r\n\r\n                                             'Weymouth, August 4, 1804.\r\n\r\n'My dear little Angel,--How can I sufficiently express to my sweetest,\r\nmy darling love, the delight which her dear, her pretty letter gave\r\nme, or how do justice to the emotion it excited? Millions and millions\r\nof thanks for it, my angel, and be assured that my heart is wholly\r\nsensible of your affection, and that upon it alone its whole happiness\r\ndepends.\r\n\r\n'I am, however, quite hurt that my love did not go to the Lewes Races;\r\nhow kind of her to think of me on that occasion! but I trust she knows\r\nme too well not to be convinced that I cannot bear the idea of adding\r\nto those sacrifices which I am but too sensible that she has made to me.\r\n\r\n'News my angel cannot expect from me from hence; though the life led\r\nhere, at least in the family I am in, is very hurrying, there is a\r\nsameness in it which affords little subject for a letter; except Lord\r\nChesterfield's family, there is not a single person besides ourselves\r\nI know. Last night we were at the play, which went off better than the\r\nfirst night.\r\n\r\n'Dr. O'Meara called upon me yesterday morning, and delivered me your\r\nletter; he wishes much to preach before Royalty, and if I can put him\r\nin the way of it I will.\r\n\r\n'What a time it appears to me already, my darling, since we parted; how\r\nimpatiently I look forward to next Wednesday se'night!\r\n\r\n'God bless you, my own dear, dear love!

A man is planted before the door holding a notice-board,\r\nwarning the passers-by to 'beware of bad houses and naughty women;'\r\na couple of watchmen, with their lanterns slung on the ends of long\r\npoles, are throwing a good light on the nature of the case. A clergyman\r\nand an officer, who were evidently coming direct to the establishment\r\non private ends, are, by this publicity, warned out of danger before\r\ntheir intention is disclosed to the public.\r\n\r\n_March 11, 1809._ _Yorkshire Hieroglyphics._ Plate 2.

Every day, every hour convinces me, more\r\nand more, that my whole happiness depends upon you alone. What a time\r\nit appears to be since we parted, and with what impatience do I look\r\nforward to the day after to-morrow; there are still, however, two whole\r\nnights before I clasp my darling in my arms.\r\n\r\n'How happy am I to learn that you are better; I still, however, will\r\nnot give up my hopes of the cause of your feeling uncomfortable.\r\n\r\n'Clavering is mistaken, my angel, in thinking that any new regiments\r\nare to be raised; it is not intended, only second battalions to the\r\nexisting corps; you had better, therefore, tell him so, and that you\r\nwere sure that there would be no use in applying for him.\r\n\r\n'Ten thousand thanks, my love, for the handkerchiefs, which are\r\ndelightful; and I need not, I trust, assure you of the pleasure I feel\r\nin wearing them, and thinking of the dear hands which made them for me.\r\n\r\n'Nothing could be more satisfactory than the tour I have made, and the\r\nstate in which I have found everything. The whole of the day before\r\nyesterday was employed in visiting the works at Dover, reviewing the\r\ntroops there, and examining the coast as far as this place. From\r\nFolkestone I had a very good view of those of the French Camp.\r\n\r\n'Yesterday I first reviewed the Camp here, and afterwards the 14th\r\nLight Dragoons, who are certainly in very fine order; and from thence\r\nproceeded to Brabourne Lees, to see four regiments of Militia; which\r\naltogether took me up near thirteen hours.\r\n\r\n'I am now setting off immediately to ride along the coast to Hastings,\r\nreviewing the different corps as I pass, which will take me at least as\r\nlong.\r\n\r\n'Adieu, therefore, my sweetest and dearest love, till the day after\r\nto-morrow, and be assured that to my last hour I shall ever remain\r\nyour's and your's alone.'\r\n\r\n[Addressed 'George Farquhar, Esq., 18 Gloucester Place, Portman\r\nSquare.'

Tegg,\r\nCheapside.--Mrs. Clarke's house at the corner of Gloucester Place\r\nis again the subject of caricature. The figure of the Duke of York,\r\nin his uniform, with his back to the spectator, and his face to the\r\nwall, is placed on a pedestal for disposal. A placard, posted on the\r\nhouse, announces: 'The statue on the outside having been thoroughly\r\nrepaired and whitewashed, is to be sold by private contract. For\r\nfurther particulars enquire within.' A bill-poster is sticking up the\r\nfollowing notice on behalf of the publisher: 'Caricature Warehouse, 111\r\nCheapside. A new caricature on Mrs. Clarke every day.'\r\n\r\n_March 13, 1809._ _A General Discharge, or the Darling Angel's\r\nFinishing Stroke._ Published by T. Tegg.--Mrs. Clarke has been making\r\npretty havoc among the branches of the service. She has drummed out\r\na number of officers to the tune of the 'Rogue's March;' discomfited\r\ngenerals and prelates, who, since their intrigues are unmasked, are\r\ndoing their best to get out of range. As to the 'Darling Angel's'\r\nredoubtable opponent, the Commander-in-Chief, he has laid down his\r\ncocked-hat and sword, and, on his knees, is trying to mitigate the\r\nexcess of mischief which his discarded lady-love is in a position\r\nto wreak; he is crying in despair: 'Alas, alas! for ever ruined and\r\nundone; see, see, she has spiked my Great Gun!' Mrs. Clarke, who is\r\nputting the finishing stroke to this destructive operation, is offering\r\na parting word of gratuitous advice to the now repentant Commander: 'A\r\nwise general should make good his retreat.'\r\n\r\n_March 15, 1809._ _The Champion of Oakhampton Attacking the Hydra of\r\nGloucester Place._ '_Bellua Multorum es Capitum._' Vide _Horace_. The\r\nChampion is clad in a complete suit of mail, and he is valorously\r\nrushing up to the mouth of the cavern, whence the Hydra is breaking\r\nforth; it must be confessed that the Champion seems a little staggered\r\nat the front displayed by the many-headed monster; the foremost and\r\nmost overgrown head is that of the Commander-in-Chief, begirt with the\r\n_Collar of Corruption_. The other heads are described by their collars:\r\nDowler, Sandon, Dr. O'Meara, Dr. Donovan, Mrs. Clarke, and Master\r\nCarter.\r\n\r\n_March 17, 1809._ _The Parson and the Clarke._ Published by T.\r\nTegg.--Dr. O'Meara is favoured with a private interview, of a strictly\r\nbusiness-like character, by Mrs. Clarke. The ambitious divine is\r\nthrowing up his head in such raptures that he has jerked off his\r\nlearned wig: 'Oh how I should like to preach before Royalty!' The fair\r\ndispenser of patronage, with a long roll of 'Army preferments' and a\r\nshorter list of 'Church preferments' before her, is putting the case in\r\na matter-of-fact way: 'Only pay the Clarke's fees, and the business is\r\ndone.'\r\n\r\n    So great on the Church were O'Meara's designs\r\n      That he prov'd too ambitious a spark;\r\n    But where is the wonder, ye learned divines,\r\n      That the _parson_ should follow the _Clarke_?\r\n\r\n_March 19, 1809._ _Samson Asleep on the Lap of Delilah._ Published\r\nby T. Tegg.--The Duke of York is following the example of the famous\r\nslayer of Philistines. He is sunk in slumber, with his head on the\r\nlap of his treacherous Delilah; a pile of love-letters, addressed to\r\nhis 'dearest dear,' are sufficiently indicative of his infatuation.\r\nMrs. Clarke, who is represented in the print as a by no means\r\nrepulsive-looking temptress, has taken advantage of the hero's\r\nunconsciousness to chop off his full pigtail, and she is holding up the\r\nsevered caudal appendage, as an encouragement to the enemies of the\r\nhelpless Commander-in-Chief to take advantage of their opportunity:\r\n'Gentlemen, you may now take him with safety, his strength is gone; I\r\nhave cut off his regulation tail, and there is no danger!'\r\n\r\n_March 24, 1809._ _The Resignation, or John Bull overwhelmed with\r\nGrief._ Published by T.

A portion of the King's\r\nfigure is concealed; the Duke of York has laid his _Resignation_,\r\ntogether with his coat, sword, and cocked-hat, at the paternal feet,\r\nand, kneeling in his denuded state, he is quoting the words of the\r\nparable of the Prodigal Son: 'Father, I have sinned before thee, and\r\nI am no longer worthy to be called thy son.' The monarch, who seems\r\ndeeply affected by the spectacle of his favourite son's abasement,\r\nis returning: 'Very naughty boy! very naughty boy indeed! However, I\r\nforgive you; but don't do so any more.'\r\n\r\n_March 29, 1809._ _Mrs. Clarke's Last Effort._ Published by T.\r\nTegg.--The delicate investigation being concluded, the fair mover,\r\nMrs. Clarke, was, as the satirists suggested, left without occupation;\r\nand Rowlandson has accordingly represented that she might employ her\r\ntalents to advantage in opening an inn a little way out of town; she\r\nis pictured as the landlady of _Clarke & Co's Original Tavern, from\r\nthe York Hotel, London_. Members of the Army, the Church, a Quaker,\r\nand others are hurrying up to extend their patronage to the new\r\nestablishment. Mrs. Clarke, bent on hospitable intents, is encouraging\r\nher old friends to return and rally round: 'Come forward, gentlemen;\r\nyou'll all be welcome. Every little helps':--\r\n\r\n    Your rhino rattle--come--\r\n    Men and cattle--come--\r\n        All to Mrs. Clarke O\r\n    Of trouble and monies\r\n    I'll ease you, my Honies,\r\n        And leave you in the dark O.\r\n\r\n_March 30, 1809._ _The York Dilly, or the Triumph of Innocence._\r\nPublished by T.

The national prototype, as the paying patron\r\nof the performance, is in the stage box, clapping his hands with\r\nenthusiasm, and shouting, 'Bravo, bravo!' Mrs. Clarke, as the leading\r\nactress, is standing in front of the line of players, dressed in\r\nsemi-martial fashion, with a military hat on her head, epaulettes, a\r\ngorget, a laced coat, and a crimson sash. She is speaking the farewell\r\naddress, which is as follows:--'Ladies and Gentlemen,--Having done our\r\nduty as far as we were called upon, we most humbly take our leave of a\r\ngenerous audience; not, like the generality of actors, wishing for a\r\nrepetition of the performance, but, on the contrary, that it may never\r\nagain be repeated. As to our friend Mr. Tegg, we hope that the graphic\r\nillustrations of this drama, which he and his performers have brought\r\nforward, may meet with that encouragement which is never denied to the\r\neffusions of whim and humour by a loyal and liberal British public; but\r\nI particularly request that, while you acquit the Bishop, you will be\r\nmerciful to his Clarke.'\r\n\r\n_April 4, 1809._ _Original Plan for a Popular Monument, to be erected\r\nin Gloucester Place._ Published by T. Tegg.--The contributaries to this\r\nmonument of turpitude are grouped together to form a memorial suited\r\nto the occasion. The foundation-stone is a huge block, labelled 'York\r\nFolly,' supported on one side by the Episcopal mitre and crozier of the\r\nRight Rev. Bishop of Osnabrück, with a scroll of 'The New Morality.'\r\nThe accessories on the other side are the cocked-hat, sword, and tender\r\nlove-letters of the ex-Commander-in-Chief. A block of 'Cracked Portland\r\nStone,' and a third slab of 'Folkestone of the first quality,' refer\r\nto the agitations raised by the Duke of Portland and Lord Folkestone;\r\nthe more spirited elements are ranged above this foundation, in the\r\nform of a barrel of 'Whitbread's Entire,' 'Burdett's Stingo,' and\r\n'Wardle's British Spirit,' these gentlemen having been the most active\r\nin enforcing the Duke's resignation. 'Romilly Freestone' supports a\r\npair of medallions representing the two officers consigned to Newgate\r\nfor prevarication--'Sandon' and 'Clavering's Dumps.' _Mrs. Clarke's\r\nPyramid_, a golden cone, caps the edifice reared on corruption.\r\n\r\n_April 5, 1809._ _A York Address to the Whale Caught lately off\r\nGravesend._ Published by T. Tegg.--The Duke of York, in his\r\nregimentals, has gone down on his knees to the latest wonder of the\r\nhour, and is beseeching the popular arrival to divert the minds of\r\nan excitement-loving public from his own particular case: 'O mighty\r\nmonster of the deep, continue to attract the attention of John Bull,\r\nbend his mind solely towards thee, for in that is my only hope;\r\nfascinated by thy powerful attractions, he may perhaps forget the\r\nhonour of a Prince.'\r\n\r\n_April 10, 1809._ _The Flower of the City._--The figure of Alderman\r\nFlower is represented in the centre of a huge sunflower blowing on a\r\nstem, 'Weak Stock,' planted in a pot of 'Rank Butter,' and elevated\r\non two cheeses, marked 'Mouldy and Rotten.' A sinister blast from a\r\ndiabolical agent is withering the plant, and the leaves are falling;\r\nthey are labelled with various uncomplimentary sentences, suggesting\r\nall kinds of vices, belonging to the parent shoot. Below this\r\nunflattering tribute to the Alderman is inscribed the following parody\r\nof verses:--\r\n\r\n    The Flow'r of the City, so gaudy and fine,\r\n    'Midst proud ones the proudest, was erst known to shine.\r\n    It spread its gay leaves and it show'd its rich clothes,\r\n    And to all (less in consequence) turn'd up its nose!\r\n    Till a blight, a sad blight, from a Democrat wind\r\n    Struck the sensitive plant, both before and behind.\r\n    It felt the keen blast! All its arrogance fled,\r\n    And the Flow'r of the City hung, hung down its head.\r\n\r\n    The Flow'r of the City, thus doom'd to despair,\r\n    Droops, pines, and with wailing impregnates the air!\r\n    Tells its pride and its folly (the cause of its grief),\r\n    While the tears of repentance encumber each leaf!\r\n    But vain are its tears, or the fate it bemoans,\r\n    The world, the base world, gives but hisses and groans!\r\n    For ever! for ever! its proud hopes are fled,\r\n    And the Flow'r of the City hangs, hangs down its head.\r\n\r\n_April 10, 1809._ _The Modern Babel, or Giants Crushed by a Weight\r\nof Evidence._ Published by T. Tegg.--The unfortunate Duke of York,\r\nwith his Counsel and learned supporters, are crushed down under the\r\nweight of a compound structure which has been imposed upon their heads\r\nand shoulders. The bulkiest mass is the _Evidence of Mrs. Clarke_;\r\n_Miss Taylor's Evidence_ is next in consequence, and the pyramidal\r\nslabs decrease upwards: _Sly hits from Sandon and Clavering_; _Home\r\nStrokes from Dowling_; _Mrs. Hovendon's Evidence_; _Mrs. Tavery, Doctor\r\nO'Meara, Master Carter_, &c. The person of Mrs. Clarke, posed in a\r\ntriumphant attitude, is the figure which completes this superstructure\r\nof folly.\r\n\r\n_April 18, 1809._ _The Sick Lion and the Asses._ Published by T.\r\nTegg.--The Duke of York's head is placed on the shoulders of the\r\ndisabled forest king, a pair of asses are showing their heels to the\r\nroyal beast. 'What a _Cur it is_!' and 'Every man has his _Price_,'\r\nwritten on their collars, proclaim the identity of these animals.\r\nAnother ass, of deeper cunning, forbears to take advantage of the\r\nprostrate lion, from far-seeing motives: 'Pshaw, pshaw! don't be\r\nafraid, I shall not kick, you may depend upon me--you may be of service\r\nto me hereafter!'\r\n\r\nThe apologue is said to be 'taken from Mr. Waithman's speech at the\r\nCommon Hall:' 'When the royal beast was sick to death, and unable to\r\ndefend himself, the minor beasts he had injured came to revile him with\r\ntheir wrongs; but when the dull asses came to fling their heels at\r\nhim the royal animal exclaimed: \"Injuries from others I can bear with\r\nresignation, but to bear insult from such vile animals as asses is to\r\ndie a hundred deaths!\"'\r\n\r\n_April 21, 1809._ _Burning the Books._ Published by T. Tegg.--As we\r\nhave traced in the summary of the diversified proceedings in the Clarke\r\nScandal, the friends of the Duke of York were glad, as a last resource,\r\nto make terms with the enemy; and the conditions under which Mrs.\r\nClarke's silence was purchased being published abroad (considering the\r\npublicity of the circumstances attending the _Investigation_, the terms\r\nof surrender could not be disguised), the satirists made merry over\r\nthis fresh instance of tergiversation.\r\n\r\nThe edition of Mrs. Clarke's memoirs, the bombshell which threatened\r\nthe aristocratic peace of mind, was purchased for a certain sum. In\r\nthe print of 'Burning the Books' the heroine of the scandal is holding\r\nup the terms of surrender: '10,000_l._, debts paid, 600_l._ per annum,\r\n&c. &c.' The heroine of the memoirs is directing the destruction of\r\nher eagerly-expected volumes, containing hundreds of letters from\r\npersons of quality, including the correspondence (supposed to have\r\nbeen destroyed) of the Duke of York. The lady is zealous enough in the\r\ninterests of her profitable clients: 'Burn away! I would burn half\r\nthe universe for the money. You may preserve a copy or two for Doctor\r\nO'Meara and a few private friends. Now for my Brimstone carriage!' The\r\nprinter's men are carrying piles of the offending work, and committing\r\nthe edition to the flames. An acknowledgment from the publisher is\r\non the writing-table: 'Received for paper and printing, and also for\r\ndestroying this,' &c. The figure of the Duke of York is shown, slily\r\npeeping from behind a curtain; the Commander, lately resigned, is\r\nevidently delighted at the course things are taking, and is crying,\r\n'This will do!' Many of the letters, as Mrs. Clarke declared,\r\nreflected in disrespectful terms on the heir to the throne and others\r\nof his royal brothers.\r\n\r\n_April 22, 1809._ _A Piece-Offering._ Published by T. Tegg.--Mrs.\r\nClarke, in all her extensive finery, is sacrificing her memoirs,\r\n_Life of Mrs. Clarke_, the Duke's ardent love-letters, and all the\r\ndisagreeable evidences supposed to have remained in her possession, at\r\nthe _Altar of Repentance_. The figure of the Commander is rising in\r\neffigy above the flames, in the centre of a brilliant sun; his face\r\nis turned to the authoress of the pyre with a satisfied smile. The\r\nhigh-priestess of the sacrifice is gratefully addressing the mollified\r\ndivinity: 'Thus perish all that gives my darling pain!'\r\n\r\n_May 24, 1809._ _The Quaker and the Clarke._ Published by T. Tegg.--A\r\nsedate Quaker, in a suit of modest brown, has turned his back on\r\nthe beguiling enchantress, fair authoress of so much mischief, and\r\nis hurrying away from her entreaties 'to tarry a while,' declaring:\r\n'Woman, avaunt! I am not to be tempted; and be it known also I am a\r\nmarried man,' &c.\r\n\r\n_May 28, 1809._ _John Bull and the Genius of Corruption._ Published\r\nby T. Tegg (94).--The national prototype has been haranguing on the\r\nextinction of abuses with a compound symbolical monster, who is\r\nstanding in the way of progress and healthy legislation. Mr. Bull's\r\ncorrupt opponent is making the Jesuitical concession: 'What you say\r\nabout Reform, Johnny, is very true, but this is not the time for it!'\r\nJohn Bull, who has no opinion of the obstructive party, is retorting,\r\n'No, nor it never will be while such a monster as you remains in\r\nexistence!'\r\n\r\nThe monster, who is evidently a difficult customer to deal with, wears\r\na defensive cap of _Professions and Promises_; he has 'an eye to\r\n_Interest_,' a _Mouth of Guile_, and a nose to _Scent for Interest_; he\r\nwears the _Collar of Corruption_, has _Wings of Speculation_, _Arms of\r\nPower_, and _Hands of Extortion_, and is further provided with bags of\r\ngold for the purpose of bribery, _Deep Pockets of Perquisites_, _Legs\r\nof Luxury_, and he is propped on _Feet of Connivance_.\r\n\r\n_June 12, 1809._ _Boney's Broken Bridge._--The Austrian army is drawn\r\nup in security on one side of the river Danube; Buonaparte, in a fine\r\nrage with his discomfited generals, and his disappointed legions,\r\nare arrayed on the other bank, powerless to disturb their exulting\r\nadversaries. The Emperor is pointing to the remains of his famous\r\nbridge, and furiously demanding, in reply to the Austrian taunts: 'Ah,\r\nwho is it that dares contradict me? I say it was some floating timber\r\nand the high swell of the river that caused the shocking accident!' An\r\nimpolitic old general, bowing low, and in consternation at the news\r\nhe is obliged to impart, is replying: 'With all due deference to your\r\nlittle Majesty, it was the Austrian fire-boats that destroyed the\r\nbridge.' The Archduke's troops are chanting a new edition of an old\r\nnursery rhyme:--\r\n\r\n    Boney's bridge is broken down,\r\n      Dance over the Lady Lee;\r\n    Boney's bridge is broken down\r\n      By an Archduke--ee.\r\n\r\n_July 9, 1809._ _Hell Broke Loose, or the Devil to Pay among the\r\n'Darling Angels.'_ Published by T. Tegg.--The dark fiend is standing at\r\nthe gates of the infernal regions, scourge in hand; he is dressed in\r\nthe wig and robes of a judge, and poised on a slab, setting forth the\r\nwell-recognised axiom: _Two of a trade can never agree_. The diabolical\r\npersonage is holding the balance between the two principal actors in\r\nthe late proceedings. It will be remembered that a misunderstanding\r\noccurred between the chief conspirators. Soon after the conclusion of\r\nthe investigation in the House of Commons, Colonel Wardle and Mrs.\r\nClarke began to exchange mutual recriminations, and the public were\r\ngratified with fresh scandalous revelations; the champion of impartial\r\njustice began to lose his strangely-earned popularity. Colonel\r\nWardle is plunged into the scale of _Patriotism_, with an infernal\r\nimp to weigh him down; the gold box, in which the freedoms of more\r\nthan one town were offered to the enemy of corruption, and the York\r\n_impeachment papers_ are thrown into the scale to make weight. Mrs.\r\nClarke is balanced against her late coadjutor in the scale of _Virtue_.\r\n'Love-letters, Mr. Wright's bill, Doctor Donovan's bill,' &c., are\r\nadded to weigh against the Colonel's testimonials.\r\n\r\n_July, 1809._ _The Tables are Turned. How are the Mighty Fallen!_--The\r\npublic were treated with the spectacle of the patriotic champion sued\r\nin a law court for the furniture of Mrs. Clarke's house at Westbourne\r\nPlace, which had been taken on his guarantee and recommendation. The\r\nCourt gave judgment against the crestfallen Colonel, who had denied\r\nhis liability, and he was adjudged to pay the heavy expenses incurred\r\nin the new establishment and the incidental costs of the process. In\r\nRowlandson's view of the situation Mrs. Clarke is seen mounted on her\r\nasinine ex-supporter; the head of the steed bears a face suggestively\r\nresembling the countenance of the patriot; a 'Turkey carpet' furnishes\r\na saddle; the motto _England expects every man to do his duty_ is\r\nwritten on the bridle; 'Wright, the upholsterer's bill' is tied to\r\nthe animal's tail; the lady is whipping up her reluctant supporter\r\nwith a birch labelled 'Private promises.' The ass is scattering the\r\nchairs, tables, mirrors, fenders, and other objects particularised on\r\n'the bill' which gave the Colonel so much irritation; the flattering\r\npresentations, addresses, gold boxes, 'Thanks to my ass,' 'Lies against\r\nthe Duke of York,' 'Thanks to a Welch Billy Goat,' 'From the City of\r\nLondon,' 'Thanks and freedom in a gold box,' and other complimentary\r\ntestimonials, are scattered on the ground. The dashing rider is making\r\nan exhibition of her skilful management of the donkey tribe:--\r\n\r\n    I've a fine stud of Asses as ever was seen;\r\n    This is one of the number from Westbourne Green.\r\n      Gee up, Neddy, come up, Neddy, &c.,\r\n      What do you think of my Neddy and me?\r\n\r\n_July 14, 1809._ _More of the Clarke, or Fresh Accusations._ Published\r\nby T. Tegg.--Colonel Wardle is exposed to the public in a humiliating\r\nposition; his former mob-popularity is reversed, and their admiration\r\nis changed to ridicule. The scene is supposed to take place in front\r\nof the mansion in Westbourne Place, before which is assembled a crowd\r\nof jeering spectators. Mrs. Clarke, unabashed, as in the previous\r\ndisclosures, is frankly denouncing her ex-colleague, and pointing to\r\nthe luxurious fittings of her bedroom. She is unmasking the scandalised\r\nchampion to his late friends the mob: 'And Clarke said unto Felix, Thou\r\nart the man;--behold the furniture! and Felix trembled.' The Colonel,\r\nwhose reputation did not improve as the innuendoes of his new opponents\r\nbecame more daring, with clasped hands and his knees knocking together,\r\nis servilely trying to reinstate his lost reputation: 'Good people of\r\nthe United Kingdom, suspend your judgment for the present, till I get\r\nthis woman placed in the pillory. I never did anything naughty no more\r\nthan the child unborn. It was all for the good of my country, I assure\r\nyou. I am as firm a patriot as ever purchased a convex mirror or a red\r\nTurkey carpet.'\r\n\r\n_July 16, 1809._ _The Plot Thickens, or Diamond Cut Diamond._ Published\r\nby T. Tegg.--Mrs. Clarke is still in the thick of her complications.\r\nShe is standing, unmoved, in the centre of the picture. Colonel Wardle,\r\nwho soon fell out with his ally when pushed to fulfil her conditions,\r\nis declaring for vengeance: 'I intend to commence an action against\r\nher for obtaining money under false pretences in the case of French's\r\nlevy. I'll teach her to send gentlemen to Newgate.' Another individual,\r\ndressed as a civilian, recommends: 'Leave her to me; I'll touch her\r\nup in the furniture business!' Mrs. Clarke, with her hands on her\r\nlips, is replying: 'I don't care a fig for any of you; and as to you,\r\nMr. Furnituremonger, I'll be beforehand with you.' A stout gentleman\r\nbehind the fair _intriguante_ cries, 'That's a good girl, follow him\r\nup; I'll back you; I'll let him know whose _Wright_ and whose _Wrong_.\r\nIf I don't enter an action against him I'm no upholsterer.' A young\r\nbarrister, holding a voluminous brief, is smiling with satisfaction at\r\nthe prospect of litigation, and encouraging both sides: 'That's right,\r\nmy good friends; it's all for the _Best_!'\r\n\r\n_July 18, 1809._ _Amusement for the Recess, or the Devil to Pay amongst\r\nthe Furniture._ Published by T. Tegg.--Colonel Wardle is represented,\r\nin an infuriated state, wreaking vengeance on the offensive furniture,\r\nwhich had caused the destruction of his popularity and his reputation;\r\nthe lately immaculate champion is armed with a bludgeon; he is\r\ntrampling under foot 'An Essay on Keeping Bad Company,' and breaking\r\nup the elegant belongings of the establishment, for the privilege of\r\nsupplying which he had been compelled to pay a sufficiently heavy\r\npenalty; he is made to exclaim: 'D---- the furniture, d---- the convex\r\nmirrors and red Turkey carpets; d---- Westbourne Place and everything\r\nthat belongs to it.' Mrs. Clarke is rather entertained than dismayed\r\nat this spirit of wanton destructiveness: 'Deary, those little gusts\r\nof Welsh passion become you extremely; the exercise will do you good;\r\nbesides, it will increase your popularity!'\r\n\r\n_July 30, 1809._ _The Bill of Wright's, or the Patriot Alarmed._\r\nPublished by T. Tegg.--The upholsterer has waited on Colonel Wardle\r\nand unrolled his long bill: 'Gullem Waddle, Esq., to Wright. Red\r\nTurkey carpet, convex mirror, chandeliers, sideboards, bed furniture,\r\nchairs and tables, vases and cellarets, Egyptian furniture, _sofa à la\r\nClarke_,' and other weighty items. 'Mr. Gullem Waddle, I have brought\r\nyou in a small bill for goods delivered for the Cleopatra of Westbourne\r\nPlace; and, as you are a true patriot, you can have no possible\r\nobjection to the Bill of Wright's.' The dismayed Colonel, keeping his\r\nhands in his pockets, is making a counter-proposal: 'What do you talk\r\nabout patriotism? I tell you I have left off practice. D---- the Bill\r\nof Wright's! It is all a mistake about Westbourne Place; you should\r\nhave taken it to Gloucester Place--there you would be sure to have had\r\nyour money!'\r\n\r\n_August 1, 1809._ _The Mistake._ Published by T.

A certain amount of care is bestowed on the execution\r\nof this plate. The marvels of the age in which the caricature was\r\npublished have not, in most cases, become monotonously plentiful in\r\nour own day. As set down by the satirist the ten wonders were the\r\ndiscoveries of 'A modest woman of quality; a primitive Bishop; a real\r\nmaid of five-and-thirty; an exciseman with a conscience; an author with\r\na second suit of clothes (this fictitious person has been represented\r\nin a most jubilant fashion); a great man of common sense; a woman who\r\nhas continued three months a widow; a theatrical hero of modesty and\r\neconomy; a complete honest attorney;' and, lastly, 'a man of talents,\r\nwit, and learning possessed of a thousand a year.'\r\n\r\nOn the close of the Clarke Scandal, which had fitly served the purpose\r\nof the satirist, our caricaturist resumed his series of attacks upon\r\nthe more memorable 'disturber of the peace of Europe.'\r\n\r\n_August 28, 1809._ _The Rising Sun, or a View of the Continent._\r\nPublished by R. Ackermann.--Buonaparte is surrounded by the Continental\r\nPowers; his present occupation is to lull and rock to slumber, in a\r\ncradle, the Russian Bear, muzzled with French promises, and tempted\r\nwith 'Turkey wheat.' The Corsican is figuratively and literally sitting\r\non thorns; the sun of Spain and Portugal is arising on the meridian\r\nwith threatening import. Sweden has taken the part of watchguard of\r\nFreedom, and is raising the cap of liberty; a Swedish huzzar is making\r\na desperate sabre-cut at the too successful general, and sounding a\r\nwarning note to the betrayed Muscovite: 'Awake, thou sluggard, ere the\r\nfatal blow is struck, and thou and thine execrable ally sunk to eternal\r\noblivion.' The Emperor is disturbed by the new light: 'This rising sun\r\nhas set me upon thorns.' The Dutchman, with a broken sceptre, is sunk\r\nin a besotted sleep on a cask of 'genuine hollands,' and leaning the\r\nweight of his fat person on his ally, who finds the weight a trifle\r\ncrushing. Poland is represented as a shadow; the Prussian eagle is\r\ntrussed; and the King, with straw in his hair, and confined in a\r\nstrait-waistcoat, is singing mad ditties. Denmark is snuffed out under\r\nan extinguisher; but the Austrian Emperor is once more taking heart\r\nand advancing to the attack, sabre in hand, with dangerous intentions:\r\n'Tyrant, I defy thee and thy cursed crew!'\r\n\r\n_September 3, 1809._ _The Pope's Excommunication of Buonaparte, or\r\nNapoleon brought to his last stool._ Published by T.

The head of the Church is propped up on 'French\r\ncrutches,' and his triple crown is split asunder; he is declaring: 'He\r\nhas cracked my crown, overturned my temporal dignities; but I am so\r\ntrammelled in these crutches that I cannot follow him as I would wish;\r\nhowever, my good Lord Cardinals, read him the excommunication--it will\r\nmake him tremble on his throne.' The Cardinals proceed to rehearse\r\nthe contents of the comminatory scroll; the Emperor, who is holding\r\nan 'Essay on the Church of Rome,' amongst other waste papers, is\r\nreturning, unmoved: 'Mercy on me! I never heard anything half so\r\ndreadful.

Tegg.--The artist has furnished the heading\r\nfor a parody setting forth the adventures of the gallant Curtis,\r\nAlderman and Commodore, with the expedition which was sent to assist\r\nour allies the Dutch against the French. Curtis is seated in his\r\narmchair in the cabin of his yacht, a great gold challenge cup, _Speedy\r\nand Soon_, in his grasp, with a turtle laid on its back by his side.\r\nA party of English officers belonging to the expedition have come\r\non board, and they are making free with his good things; wine and\r\npunch are flowing lavishly. According to the song-writer's version\r\nthese gallant warriors, having boarded the Commodore's yacht and made\r\nsad havoc with all his provisions, succeeded, after a three days'\r\ndevastation, in eating and drinking all the plentiful supplies laid in\r\nby poor Curtis, until at last he began to dread that they might take\r\nit into their heads to eat him too. Although the worthy cit set out\r\nenthusiastically and filled with valour, his return was somewhat less\r\nheroic:--\r\n\r\n    From Ramsgate we set sail for Flushing,\r\n      To aid our friends the Mynheers;\r\n    And for the Scheld our fleet was pushing,\r\n      Resolved to trounce the d----d Monsieurs!\r\n\r\nSlightly discomfited, the Commodore sounds a retreat:--\r\n\r\n    Now farewell all my hopes of glory,\r\n      Scheld's muddy flood and isles adieu;\r\n    I'll lead the van with the first story,\r\n      And tell the Cockneys something new.\r\n    I'll talk of batteries, bloody sieges,\r\n      Of fizzing bombshells, towns on fire,\r\n    Till my tale the whole town obliges\r\n      My deeds and courage to admire.\r\n\r\n_September 14, 1809._ _A Design for a Monument to be erected in\r\ncommemoration of the glorious and never-to-be-forgotten Grand\r\nExpedition, so ably planned and executed in the year 1809._ Published\r\nby T.

Tegg.--This cartoon, in\r\nsix compartments, is aimed at Kemble's new house, which, from certain\r\narrangements of the boxes, and other innovations, became the cause of\r\nconsiderable turbulence--\r\n\r\n    These are the Boxes let to the great\r\n    That visit the House that Jack built.\r\n\r\nThe curtain of the theatre bears the advertisement: 'Grand theatrical\r\nBagnio, fitted up in the Italian style;' 'Lodgings to let for\r\nthe season, or a single night;' 'Roomy pit for parsons, poets,\r\nPresbyterians, Quakers, grumblers,' &c.; 'Boxes for the Cyprian corps,\r\nwith snug lobby to ditto;' 'Private accommodations for the Members of\r\nboth Houses of Parliament;' '_Boudoirs pour la Noblesse_;' 'Rabbit\r\nhutches, seven shillings each;' 'Humbug gallery, _two shillings_;'\r\nand, chief cause of dissatisfaction, 'Pigeon-holes for the swinish\r\nmultitude':--\r\n\r\n    These are the pigeon-holes over the Boxes,\r\n    Let to the great that visit the House that Jack built.\r\n    This is the Cat engaged to squall to the poor in the\r\n        pidgeon-holes over the Boxes, let to the great\r\n        that visit the House that Jack built.\r\n\r\nMadame Catalini is endeavouring to sing; but the audience, armed with\r\nrattles, post-horns, and other noisy instruments, are raising a regular\r\nuproar:--\r\n\r\n    This is John Bull with a bugle-horn,\r\n    That hissed the Cat engaged to squall to the poor, &c.\r\n    This is the Thief-taker,[21] shaven and shorn,\r\n    That took up John Bull, with his bugle-horn, &c.--\r\n\r\nThe rioters are having a regular stand-up fight outside the theatre, as\r\nwell as within.

The preparations are being completed,\r\nthe workmen are putting the finishing strokes in readiness for\r\nopening. Under the union-jack is _Perceval, Eldon & Co.'s Pic Nic\r\nEntertainments; any port in a storm_. Under 'false colours' is Don\r\nJohn's booth, announcing, _Set a beggar on horseback, he'll ride to the\r\ndevil_, with the _Row, or a fig for John Bull_. Mr. Canning's Booth\r\nadvertises _The Double Dealer_, with _The Duellist_. Lord Mulgrave\r\noffers _A Chapter of Accidents_, with _'Tis well 'tis no Worse_.

Under a huge cocked-hat, as a sign, is General Chatham's\r\nbooth, 'Just arrived from Flushing.' A comedy called _Delays and\r\nBlunders_, to which will be added _He will be a Soldier_, is the bill\r\noffered from Holland.

Rowlandson, 1 James\r\nStreet, Adelphi:--\r\n\r\n    O woe is me, 't have seen what I have seen;\r\n    Seeing what I see!--SHAKESPEARE.\r\n\r\nThe artist has given a view of the 'pigeon-holes' at Drury Lane, as the\r\nnew gallery in 'the house that Jack built' was derisively christened;\r\nthe present plate offers a burlesque representation of the refined\r\nparts of the house, taken possession of by a company more miscellaneous\r\nthan select. The 'rabbit-hutches,' at seven shillings, are given up\r\nto owls and deaf people; a narrow row below, in which the space is so\r\nconfined that it is impossible for the spectators to stand upright, is\r\nheld by Irish cabmen, roughs smoking long clay pipes, &c.; below these,\r\nin the _boudoirs pour la noblesse_, we find the servants of the great,\r\ndramdrinking, hobanobbing, and flirting. The occupants of the rest of\r\nthe private boxes are of a ruffianly type; big sticks and publican's\r\npewter measures are noticeable, besides gentlemen with damaged optics,\r\nand without coats; a great dog, ladies from St. Giles's, and similarly\r\ndistinguished members of society. A scene of quarrelling, practical\r\njoking, and general uproar is proceeding below.\r\n\r\n_December 23, 1809._ _A Peep at the Gas Lights in Pall Mall._\r\nWoodward del., Rowlandson sc.--The sketch represents a view of the\r\nfirst thoroughfare where gas was employed to illuminate the streets.\r\nMr. Ackermann, the publisher, was one of the earliest to light his\r\nRepository with gas, which he manufactured for the purpose, and was at\r\nconsiderable expense in providing apparatus and making experiments in\r\nimproving the process. The sightseers are lost in wonder and admiration\r\nat the novelty of finding gas burning in the streets; the lamps are\r\narranged in branches of three. A gentleman of fashion is endeavouring\r\nto explain the science of gas-making to an elegant creature on his arm:\r\n'The coals being steamed, produce tar or paint for the outside of\r\nhouses; the smoke passing through water is deprived of substance, and\r\nburns as you see.' An Irish visitor, who has, uninvited, been attending\r\nto this lucid explanation, is bursting out with 'Arrah, honey, if this\r\nman brings fire through water we shall soon have the Thames and the\r\nLiffey burnt down, and all the pretty little herrings and whales burnt\r\nto cinders!' Amongst other wondergazers is a country farmer, who is\r\nexclaiming, 'Wauns, what a main pretty light it be! we have nothing\r\nlike it in our country.' A Quaker, his companion, is responding, 'Ay,\r\nfriend, but it is all vanity; what is this to the inward light?' The\r\nmore disreputable members of the community are reflecting that the new\r\nlight will expose their depravities and put a stop to their commerce.\r\n\r\n_December, 1809._ _Joint Stock Street._ Woodward del., Rowlandson\r\nfecit. Published by T. Tegg (174).--From this satire it seems that a\r\ncompany-mania must have raged in 1809, suggestive, in its extravagance,\r\nof the days of the South Sea Bubble. In front of the _Hospital for\r\nIncurables_ is a blank wall, covered with advertisements of various\r\njoint-stock enterprises, which are attracting the attention of the\r\nspeculative. There is a _Doctors' Company_, offering incalculable\r\nadvantages: 'No charge for emetics, &c.; patent coffins provided on the\r\nshortest notice; no surgeons admitted.' '_A Company of Menders_, open\r\nto both sexes; wives to mend their husbands, husbands to mend their\r\nwives, and most particularly, everybody to mend themselves.' _Company\r\nof White-washers. N.B. No lawyers admitted. More advantages; a new\r\nCabbage and Potatoe Company, warranted genuine; no cooking required,\r\nsaves time and trouble._ At the corner of Bubble Alley is the following\r\ntempting notice: _Peter Puff, manufacturer of deal boards without\r\nknots, from genuine sawdust, &c._ And outside a miserable hovel is the\r\nadvertisement of _Tim Slashem, barber, and perriwig maker, who has a\r\ncompany in formation of mowers of beards by a new machine, to shave\r\nsixty men in a minute, to comb, oil, and powder their wigs in the\r\nbargain_.\r\n\r\n_December 24, 1809._ _The Bull and Mouth._ Woodward del., Rowlandson\r\nsc. Published by T. Tegg (290).--A corpulent gentleman, wearing a\r\ndressing-gown and nightcap, is yawning and stretching in his armchair.\r\nHis huge head and gaping jaws would furnish forth excellently well a\r\nsign for the _Bull and Mouth_. By his side stands a handsome and highly\r\ndeveloped lady, who is taking advantage of the sleepiness of her rude\r\nmonster to slip a _billet-doux_ into the hand of a military officer,\r\nwho is waiting in the rear.\r\n\r\n1809. _A Glee. How shall we Mortals Spend our Hours? In Love! in War!\r\nin Drinking!_ Published by T. Tegg.--Three figures, represented as\r\nseated at table, with all the appointments and accessories incidental\r\nto the brewing of punch, carry out the spirit of the quotation. The\r\nlover, a smart young buck, in top-boots, is rapturously clasping his\r\nhands, after a toast, in inward contemplation of the perfections of\r\nhis mistress. An old Commodore illustrates the idea of a life spent in\r\nwarfare--although minus an eye and a leg, he is tough and hearty, and\r\nis seemingly content with his pipe and bowl. The brutalising results of\r\nhours devoted to mere bestial intoxication are realised in the person\r\nof a slovenly and imbecile sot.\r\n\r\n1809. _Rowlandson's Sketches from Nature._ Drawn and etched by\r\nRowlandson.

In saying this she disengaged her\r\nhand with a look which I thought a sufficient commentary upon the text.\r\n\r\nThe triumphs of a true feminine heart are short upon these\r\ndiscomfitures. In a very few seconds she laid her hand upon the cuff of\r\nmy coat, in order to finish her reply.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI fear, in this interval, I must have made some slight efforts towards\r\na closer compression of her hand, from a subtle sensation I felt in the\r\npalm of my own--not as if she was going to withdraw hers, but as if she\r\nthought about it--and I had infallibly lost it a second time, had not\r\ninstinct more than reason directed me to the last resource in these\r\ndangers--to hold it loosely, and in a manner as if I was every moment\r\ngoing to release it of myself; so she let it continue, till Monsieur\r\nDessein returned with the key; and in the meantime I set myself to\r\nconsider how I should undo the ill impressions which the poor monk's\r\nstory, in case he had told it her, must have planted in her breast\r\nagainst me.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: YORICK AND FATHER LORENZO.]\r\n\r\n_The Snuffbox._--The good old monk was within six paces of us, as the\r\nidea of them crossed my mind, and was advancing towards us a little\r\nout of the line, as if uncertain whether he should break in upon us or\r\nno. He stopped, however, as soon as he came up to us, with a world of\r\nfrankness; and having a horn snuffbox in his hand, he presented it,\r\nopen, to me. 'You shall taste mine,' said I, pulling out my box (which\r\nwas a small tortoiseshell one), and putting it into his hand. ''Tis\r\nmost excellent,' said the monk. 'Then do me the favour,' I replied,\r\n'to accept of the box and all; and, when you take a pinch out of it,\r\nsometimes recollect it was the peace offering of a man who once used\r\nyou unkindly, but not from his heart.'\r\n\r\nThe poor monk blushed as red as scarlet. '_Mon Dieu!_' said he,\r\npressing his hands together, 'you never used me unkindly.' 'I should\r\nthink,' said the lady, 'he is not likely.' I blushed in my turn, but\r\nfrom what movements I leave to the few who feel to analyse. 'Excuse\r\nme, madame,' replied I, 'I treated him most unkindly, and from no\r\nprovocations.' ''Tis impossible,' said the lady. 'My God!' cried the\r\nmonk, with a warmth of asseveration which seemed not to belong to him,\r\n'the fault was in me, and in the indiscretion of my zeal.' The lady\r\nopposed it, and I joined with her in maintaining it was impossible that\r\na spirit so regulated as his could give offence to any.\r\n\r\nI knew not that contention could be rendered so sweet and pleasurable a\r\nthing to the nerves as I then felt it. We remained silent, without any\r\nsensations of that foolish pain which takes place when in such a circle\r\nyou look for ten minutes in one another's faces without saying a word.\r\nWhilst this lasted, the monk rubbed his horn box upon the sleeve of his\r\ntunic; and as soon as it had acquired a little air of brightness by\r\nthe friction, he made a low bow and said 'twas too late to say whether\r\nit was the weakness or goodness of our tempers which had involved us\r\nin this contest; but be it as it would, he begged we might exchange\r\nboxes. In saying this he presented his to me with one hand as he took\r\nmine from me in the other, and having kissed it, with a stream of good\r\nnature in his eyes, he put it into his bosom--and took his leave.\r\n\r\nI guard this box, as I would the instrumental parts of my religion,\r\nto help my mind on to something better: in truth, I seldom go abroad\r\nwithout it; and oft and many a time have I called up by it the\r\ncourteous spirit of its owner to regulate my own, in the jostlings of\r\nthe world: they had found full employment for his, as I learnt from\r\nhis story, till about the forty-fifth year of his age, when, upon\r\nsome military services ill requited, and meeting at the same time a\r\ndisappointment in the tenderest of passions, he abandoned the sword and\r\nthe sex together, and took sanctuary, not so much in his convent as in\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\nI feel a damp upon my spirits as I am going to add, that in my last\r\nreturn through Calais, upon enquiring after Father Lorenzo, I heard he\r\nhad been dead near three months, and was buried, not in his convent,\r\nbut, according to his desire, in a little cemetery belonging to it,\r\nabout two leagues off. I had a strong desire to see where they had\r\nlaid him--when, upon pulling out his little horn box, as I sat by his\r\ngrave, and plucking up a nettle or two at the head of it, which had no\r\nbusiness to grow there, they all struck together so forcibly upon my\r\naffections, that I burst into a flood of tears. But I am as weak as a\r\nwoman; and I beg the world not to smile, but pity me.\r\n\r\nMONTRIUL.\r\n\r\n_The Bidet._--When all is ready, and every article is disputed and paid\r\nfor in the inn, unless you are a little soured by the adventure, there\r\nis always a matter to compound at the door, before you can get into\r\nyour chaise; and that is with the sons and daughters of poverty, who\r\nsurround you. Let no man say, 'Let them go to the devil'--'tis a cruel\r\njourney to send a few miserables, and they have had sufferings enow\r\nwithout it. I always find it better to take a few sous out in my hand;\r\nand I would counsel every gentle traveller to do so likewise: he need\r\nnot be so exact in setting down his motives for giving them--they will\r\nbe registered elsewhere.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHaving settled all these small matters, I got into my postchaise with\r\nmore ease than ever I got into a postchaise in my life; and La Fleur\r\nhaving got one large jack-boot on the far side of a little _bidet_\r\n(post-horse), and another on this (for I count nothing of his legs), he\r\ncantered away before me, as happy and as perpendicular as a prince.\r\n\r\nBut what is happiness! What is grandeur in this painted scene of life!\r\nA dead ass, before we had got a league, put a stop to La Fleur's\r\ncareer--his _bidet_ would not pass it; a contention arose betwixt them,\r\nand the poor fellow was kicked out of his jack-boots the very first\r\nkick.\r\n\r\nLa Fleur bore his fall like a French Christian, saying neither more or\r\nless upon it than _Diable!_ so presently got up and came to the charge\r\nagain--then this way--then that way: and, in short, every way but by\r\nthe dead ass. La Fleur insisted upon the thing--and the _bidet_ threw\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n'What's the matter, La Fleur,' said I, 'with this _bidet_ of thine?'\r\n'_Monsieur_,' said he, '_c'est un cheval le plus opiniatre du monde_.'\r\n'Nay, if he is a conceited beast, he must go his own way,' replied I.\r\nSo La Fleur got off him, and giving him a good sound lash, the _bidet_\r\ntook me at my word, and away he scampered back to Montriul. '_Peste!_'\r\nsaid La Fleur.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Le Diable!_ which is the first and positive degree, is generally used\r\nfor ordinary emotions of the mind, where small things only fall out\r\ncontrary to your expectation, such as--the throwing one's doublets--La\r\nFleur's being kicked off his horse, and so forth--cuckoldom, for the\r\nsame reason, is always--_Le Diable!_\r\n\r\nBut in cases where the cast has something provoking in it, as in that\r\nof the _bidet's_ running away after--and leaving La Fleur aground in\r\njack-boots--'tis the second degree. 'Tis then _Peste!_\r\n\r\nAs there was no hunting down a frightened horse in jack-boots, there\r\nremained no alternative but taking La Fleur either behind the chaise or\r\ninto it.\r\n\r\nI preferred the latter, and in half an hour we got to the post-house at\r\nNamport.\r\n\r\nNAMPORT.\r\n\r\n_The Dead Ass._--'And this,' said he, putting the remains of a crust\r\ninto his wallet, 'and this should have been thy portion,' said he,\r\n'had'st thou been alive to have shared it with me.' I thought by the\r\naccent it had been an apostrophe to his child; but it was to his ass,\r\nand to the very ass we had seen dead in the road, which had occasioned\r\nLa Fleur's misadventure. The man seemed to lament it much; and it\r\ninstantly brought into my mind Sancho's lamentation for his; but he did\r\nit with more true touches of nature.\r\n\r\nThe mourner was sitting upon a stone bench at the door, with the\r\nass's pannel and its bridle on one side, which he took up from time\r\nto time--then laid them down--looked at them, and shook his head. He\r\nthen took his crust of bread out of his wallet again, as if to eat it;\r\nheld it some time in his hand, then laid it upon the bit of his ass's\r\nbridle--looked wistfully at the little arrangement he had made, and\r\nthen gave a sigh.\r\n\r\nThe simplicity of his grief drew numbers about him, and La Fleur among\r\nthe rest, whilst the horses were getting ready; as I continued sitting\r\nin the postchaise, I could see and hear over their heads.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LA FLEUR AND THE DEAD ASS.]\r\n\r\nHe said he had come last from Spain, where he had been from the\r\nfarthest borders of Franconia, and had got so far on his return home,\r\nwhen his ass died. Everyone seemed desirous to know what business could\r\nhave taken so old and poor a man so far a journey from his own home.\r\n\r\nIt had pleased heaven, he said, to bless him with three sons, the\r\nfinest lads in Germany; but having, in one week, lost two of them by\r\nthe smallpox, and the youngest falling ill of the distemper, he was\r\nafraid of being bereft of them all; and made a vow, if heaven would\r\nnot take him from him also, he would go, in gratitude, to St. Jago, in\r\nSpain.\r\n\r\nWhen the mourner got thus far in his story he stopped to pay Nature her\r\ntribute, and wept bitterly.\r\n\r\nHe said heaven had accepted the conditions, and that he had set out\r\nfrom his cottage with this poor creature, who had been a patient\r\npartner of his journey--that it had eat the same bread with him all\r\nthe way and was unto him as a friend. Everybody who stood about heard\r\nthe poor fellow with concern. La Fleur offered him money. The mourner\r\nsaid he did not want it--it was not the value of the ass, but the loss\r\nof him. The ass, he said, he was assured loved him--and upon this told\r\nthem a long story of mischance upon their passage over the Pyrenean\r\nmountains, which had separated them from each other three days: during\r\nwhich time the ass had sought him as much as he had sought the ass, and\r\nthat they had neither scarce eat or drank till they met.\r\n\r\n'Thou hast one comfort, friend,' said I, 'at least in the loss of thy\r\npoor beast: I am sure thou hast been a merciful master to him.' 'Alas!'\r\nsaid the mourner, 'I thought so when he was alive, but now he is dead\r\nI think otherwise. I fear the weight of myself and my afflictions\r\ntogether have been too much for him--they have shortened the poor\r\ncreature's days, and I fear I have them to answer for.' 'Shame on the\r\nworld!' said I to myself, 'did we love each other as this poor soul but\r\nloved his ass, 'twould be something.'\r\n\r\n1809. _Butler's Hudibras_, in three parts, written in the time of the\r\nlate wars, corrected and amended, with large annotations and preface,\r\nby Zachary Grey, LL.D.

Burdett, Duke\r\nof York, Colonel Wardle, &c. 2 vols., 12mo.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[10] Mary Moser, the lively lady Royal Academician, and famous\r\nflower-painter, writing to Mrs. Lloyd, the first wife of the gentleman\r\nshe subsequently honoured with her hand, conveys the following account\r\nof the reigning mode in town, to her friend in the country: 'Come to\r\nLondon and admire our plumes; we sweep the sky! a duchess wears six\r\nfeathers, a lady four, and every milk-maid one at each corner of her\r\ncap! Your mamma desired me to inquire the name of something she had\r\nseen in the windows in Tavistock Street; it seems _she_ was afraid to\r\nask; but _I_ took courage, and they told me they were _rattle-snake\r\ntippets_; however, notwithstanding their frightful name, they are not\r\nunlike a _beaufong_, only the quills are made stiff, and springy in the\r\nstarching. Fashion is grown a monster! pray tell your operator that\r\nyour hair must measure just three quarters of a yard from the extremity\r\nof one wing to the other.'\r\n\r\n[11] 'Eighteen years before the date of the investigation (February\r\n1809), Mrs. Clarke, then being about fourteen years of age, resided\r\nwith her mother and step-father in Black Raven Passage, Cursitor\r\nStreet. She was a very pretty, sprightly, gaily-disposed girl, being\r\nvery fond of showing herself, and attracting attention. At this time\r\nMr. Joseph Clarke, son of a respectable builder on Snow Hill (his\r\nfather was the \"great contractor\" of his day, and a _man reputed to\r\nbe enormously rich_) became enamoured of Miss Thompson, who readily\r\nreceived his addresses. She eloped with him, and they lived together\r\nabout three years, when he married her. She conducted herself with\r\npropriety, and they lived together decently several years; in the\r\ncourse of which she bore him several children, four of whom are\r\nalive.'--_Gentleman's Magazine_, February, 1809.\r\n\r\n[12] The name of Mrs. Clarke's father was Thompson, and he, it appears,\r\nwas a master printer of some respectability, residing in Bowl and\r\nPin Alley, near White's Alley, Chancery Lane, where Miss Thompson\r\nwas ushered into the world, as Sterne has it, with 'squalls of\r\ndisapprobation at the journey she was compelled to perform.'\r\n\r\nUpon the death of Mr. Thompson, his widow married a Mr. Farquhar,\r\nwho was engaged as a compositor in the printing house of Mr. Hughes.\r\nMiss Thompson was occasionally employed in reading copy to the person\r\nengaged as corrector of the press, in which situation she soon\r\nattracted the notice of the son of the overseer, who, recognising\r\nher abilities, had her placed at a boarding school at Ham, where the\r\nyoung lady, whose 'capacity for elegant improvements' was, if we\r\ntrust her biographers, of an advanced order, soon acquired ornamental\r\naccomplishments; and, from the natural quickness of her parts, she\r\nreturned, after an absence of two years, so completely altered in her\r\nideas that she thought proper to despise and treat with coldness the\r\nattentions of Mr. Day, the well-meaning young gentleman who had been at\r\nthe charge of finishing her education, it is said, with the view to a\r\nfuture union with this sprightly and promising female prodigy.\r\n\r\nHer biographers have hinted at least one flirtation, possibly of a\r\nharmless description, before she arrived at the age of seventeen, when\r\nshe threw in her future with Mr. Joseph Clarke, the hopeful son of a\r\nwealthy builder and contractor in Snow Hill. After a union of many\r\nyears, during which she had experienced various vicissitudes, we find\r\nthat the misconduct of her husband, who seems, on the whole--from\r\nthe accounts of some of his contemporaries--to have done his best to\r\ndeserve the treatment he received, although there are two sides to\r\nthis story, determined the fascinating Mary Ann to trust to her own\r\nresources for support.\r\n\r\nDuring her tenure of the 'neutral territory,' the name of more than one\r\ngentleman of gallant reputation and of rank was coupled with her own;\r\nbut passing over the list of her admirers, we must mention a certain\r\nMr. Dowler (whose name occurred frequently during the investigation),\r\nwho seems to have had more faithful regard for the lady than her\r\nother doubtful lights of love. Mrs. Clarke further became ambitious\r\nof shining on a larger scale, and she had the honour of appearing on\r\nthe boards of the Haymarket Theatre in the character of Portia. Great\r\npraise was awarded her performance; her natural abilities, with a\r\ncertain vivacity, added to a well modulated voice and graceful action,\r\nwere sufficient to qualify her for a successful actress; but she\r\nfelt that her proper stage was the world, and she merely secured her\r\nintroduction to the histrionic profession as an experiment towards\r\npromoting the foundation of her future fortunes, and her object in\r\nthis regard seems to have been secured and her plans were successfully\r\nrealised.\r\n\r\n[13] _Minutes of Evidence_; and _Annual Register_, 1809.\r\n\r\n[14] Mr. Burton's defence. _Minutes of Evidence._\r\n\r\n[15] _Gentleman's Magazine._\r\n\r\n[16] Colonel Wardle had promised, or clearly given it to be understood\r\nby Mrs. Clarke, that he would furnish a house for her at Westbourne\r\nPlace, in part payment for her services in the prosecution of the Duke\r\nof York. Colonel Wardle, afterwards finding it convenient to deny\r\nthat he had come under any such obligation, was sued at law by an\r\nupholsterer who had furnished the house; and, on the evidence of Mrs.\r\nClarke and the upholsterer's brother, obliged to pay about 2000_l._,\r\nwith costs. The day after judgment was given in this cause, Colonel\r\nWardle published, in several newspapers, a note addressed to the people\r\nof the three kingdoms, declaring before God and his country that a\r\nverdict had been obtained against him only through perjury. During the\r\nprogress of the trial, the colonel had written to his men of law again\r\nand again, desiring that Major Dodd, Mr. James Glennie, heretofore of\r\nthe corps of engineers, and other respectable witnesses, should be\r\nexamined; but the lawyers thought this unnecessary. The evidence of\r\nMrs. Clarke, and of the brother of the upholsterer, on oath, would be\r\noverthrown by that of the respectable witnesses whom he had to bring\r\nforward on a second trial for which he had made application. But if so,\r\nwhat is to be thought of the evidence of Mrs. Clarke against the Duke\r\nof York?--_Annual Register_, 1809.\r\n\r\n[17] March 23, 1809.--The Speaker put the question: 'That it is the\r\nopinion of this House that General Clavering in the said evidence is\r\nguilty of prevarication,' which was agreed to without a division; and\r\nGeneral Clavering was ordered to be forthwith taken into the custody of\r\nthe Serjeant-at-Arms.\r\n\r\nMarch 24.--The Serjeant-at-Arms, having reported that General Clavering\r\nwas in custody, Mr. W. Wynne moved, 'That, for his prevarication before\r\nthe Committee of the whole House, General Clavering be now committed to\r\nNewgate, and the speaker do issue his warrant accordingly;' which was\r\nagreed to.\r\n\r\nMarch 27.--Mr. Fane presented a petition from Captain Sandon, which,\r\nafter stating his services in the army for upwards of thirty years in\r\nvarious parts of the globe, concludes with apologising for his conduct\r\nat the Bar of that House, by attributing it to the hardships he had\r\nrecently undergone in Spain, combined with an injury sustained on the\r\nbrain some time since, and the novelty of his situation when called on\r\nto give evidence.\r\n\r\nMarch 28.--On the motion of Mr. Fane, Captain Huxley Sandon was called\r\nto the Bar; and, after a very impressive reprimand from Mr. Speaker,\r\nwas ordered to be discharged out of custody on paying the fees.\r\n\r\n[18] Sometimes the word 'York' is erased from the plate 'Transforming a\r\nFootboy into a Captain.'\r\n\r\n[19] During the Parliamentary enquiry Mrs. Clarke appeared at the Bar\r\nof the House dressed in a pelisse and skirt of light blue silk, trimmed\r\nwith white fur, with a white muff, and wearing a hat and veil of white,\r\nthe latter turned up to show her face. Her features are described as\r\nmore pleasing than handsome, according to recognised standards of\r\nregular types of countenance. Her complexion was remarkably clear and\r\nanimated; and her eyes, which were blue, were large and full of light\r\nand vivacity. She was somewhat small in stature, her figure was well\r\nturned; and as her arms were much admired for their shapely form, she\r\nwas partial to attitudes which showed them off to advantage.\r\n\r\n[20] The Duke of York was reinstated in the office of\r\nCommander-in-Chief, May 26, 1811.\r\n\r\n[21] Townshend, the Bow Street Runner.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1810.\r\n\r\n\r\n_March 30, 1810._ _The Winding up of the Medical Report of the\r\nWalcheren Expedition._--The members of the Medical Board are standing\r\nin the stocks; on the green, in front of the sign of _The Goose_,\r\nwhich is surrounded with stores for the Walcheren Expedition, are\r\nlaid the bodies of various sufferers, 'sent home for inspection.' The\r\nnature of the stores is somewhat exceptional. A case of champagne,\r\nmarked 'Chelsea Hospital,' innumerable barrels of port and claret,\r\nmarked 'T.K., for the hospital and for home consumption.' Barrels of\r\nporter, bales of cobwebs, and oak bark, 'charms for the cure of agues,'\r\ntincture of arsenic, and bottles of gin.\r\n\r\n_April 12, 1810._ _Libel Hunters on the Look-out, or Daily Examiners\r\nof the Liberty of the Press._ Published by T. Tegg (4).--A committee\r\nof the _Rotten Borough Society, established in 1810_ (Gibery Vixe,\r\npresident; Leatherbreech, vice), is met to consider the licence of\r\nthe press, to bring all their faculties to bear for the detection of\r\nany lurking evidences of libel or treason. The President is reading\r\naloud, with the assistance of a magnifying glass to enlarge any\r\nsuspicious paragraphs; the members of the committee are all on the\r\n_qui vive_ to note any libellous allusions. Cobbett's _Register_ is\r\nunder examination, _Magna Charta_ is trodden under foot, and the _Bill\r\nof Rights_ is thrown on one side. From the papers pasted as memoranda\r\non the wall we are informed that 'Sir Francis Burdett is committed to\r\nthe Tower;' that '_The Morning Chronicle_ knows no bounds and must be\r\nchecked;' that 'Enquiries into the expedition to Walcheren be voted\r\ntreasonable;' 'That the _Statesman_ must beware,' and 'A watchful eye\r\nbe kept on the _Examiner_;' A 'Black list of those who vote in the\r\nminority,' &c.; 'A view of the Tower,' and 'Instructions to the Keeper\r\nof Newgate,' are among the notices put up for attention.\r\n\r\n_April 20, 1810._ _A New Tap Wanted._ Published by T.

One of\r\nthe beefeaters is enjoying the spectacle, crying, 'Bless him, I say;\r\nhe's a rum un.' Over the portcullis of the Tower gate is an escutcheon\r\nrepresenting the 'British Lion roused.' On one side of the postern is\r\nan apposite quotation from Shakespeare:--\r\n\r\n                            This dear, dear land--\r\n    Dear for her reputation through the world--\r\n    Is now leas'd out ...\r\n    Like to a tenement, or pelting farm;\r\n    England, bound in with the triumphant sea,\r\n    Whose rocky shore beats back the envious siege\r\n    Of watery Neptune, is now bound in with shame,\r\n    With inky blots, and rotten parchment bonds.'--_Richard II._\r\n\r\nAn extract from the Liberal Baronet's own speech is posted on the other\r\nside:--\r\n\r\n  From this foul and traitorous traffic our Boroughmonger Sovereigns\r\n  derive an immense revenue, cruelly wrung from the hard hand of\r\n  honest labour. I do, however, now entertain an ardent hope that\r\n  this degraded and degrading system, to which all our difficulties,\r\n  grievances, and dangers are owing, will at length give way to the\r\n  moderate but determined perseverance of a whole united people.--SIR\r\n  FRANCIS BURDETT.\r\n\r\nOne of the boroughmongering crew is already demolished; by his side,\r\non the ground, are two money-bags, 'Rapine,' and 'Drainings from the\r\nhard hand of the industrious poor.' Of the twin wretches who are being\r\nstrangled without mercy at the hands of Sir Francis Burdett one has\r\nin his pocket 'Barrow (borough?), in Cornwall, bought and sold; apply\r\nto----;' two money-bags, 'Extortion money,' and 'Bribery and Corruption\r\nbag,' are dropping from his hands; while in the pocket of the other\r\nnefarious agent may be seen 'Rotten borough to be disposed of.'\r\n\r\n_May 1, 1810._ _Views of the Colleges.

The watermen are\r\npulling a skiff to the stairs; at the same moment a breeze is blowing\r\noff a parson's wig and hat, and carrying away his fair companion's\r\nparasol, bonnet, &c. The landing steps show a succession of disasters,\r\nan ascending flight of hats, caps, and wigs, of which the astonished\r\nwearers are suddenly denuded.\r\n\r\n_May 15, 1810._ _Three Weeks after Marriage, or the Great Little\r\nEmperor Playing at Bo-peep._ Tegg's caricatures (16).--The new Empress\r\nis in a fierce passion, wreaking her vengeance on all around;\r\nTalleyrand is levelled with the floor by a blow from the sceptre;\r\nhe is crying, 'Be Gar, she will give us all de finishing stroke.' A\r\nmarshal is seeking refuge behind the curtains and declaring: 'Marbleu,\r\nvat a crown-cracker she be!' The little Emperor is dodging behind an\r\narmchair, beseeching his stricken prime minister, 'Tally, Tally,' to\r\n'rise and rally.' The Empress is threatening to hurl the Imperial\r\ncrown at her intimidated lord and master, protesting, 'By the Head\r\nof Jove, I hate him worse than famine or disease. Perish his family!\r\nlet inveterate hate commence between our houses from this moment, and\r\nmeeting, never let them bloodless part.' The coronation throne has the\r\ncrown knocked off; and, kicked on the floor by this untamable Austrian,\r\nare all the conquered diadems of Europe, including the Pope's tiara and\r\nthe iron crown of Italy.\r\n\r\n_May 15. 1810._ _A Bonnet Shop._ Rowlandson del. Tegg's collection\r\n(17).--This plate is best described from the advertisement of the\r\nproprietress, displayed on her premises, for the manufacture of the\r\nstraw bonnets and hats which were the _mode_ at the beginning of the\r\ncentury: 'Miss Flimsey's fashionable warehouse; the greatest variety of\r\nstraw hats and bonnets made up in the most elegant taste. A large stock\r\nof Spanish, Flemish, Provincial, Gipsy, Cottage, Woodland, &c., &c.,\r\nadapted to show every feature to advantage.'\r\n\r\nAn old fright is trying on an unbecoming straw-bonnet at a mirror,\r\nwhile a handsome saleswoman is puffing her wares. A number of pretty\r\napprentices are trimming hats, and an antiquated quiz, with his\r\nspyglass, is poking his head through the window, and saluting the bevy\r\nof beauties with a satyr-like grin.\r\n\r\n'_Miseries à la Mode._--The being over-persuaded by a canting\r\nshopwoman, in endeavouring to puff off a stale article, that it is the\r\nmost becoming and suitable to your style of features; but on consulting\r\nyour friends and acquaintance they pronounce it the most frightful,\r\nhideous, and unfashionably formed thing--that would disgrace Cranbourne\r\nAlley.'\r\n\r\n_May 20, 1810._ _Peter Plumb's Diary._ Published by T. Tegg (18).--The\r\npicture represents the drawing-room of a 'warm citizen,' evidently\r\n'worth a plum.' The corpulent master of the house and the no less\r\nwell-favoured partner of his bosom are seated before a capital fire;\r\nthe comfortable couple have drunk their port and supped their punch,\r\nof which a capacious bowl is ready to hand on a table between them;\r\nthe host has smoked a whiff of 'Turkey' and then dropped off to sleep\r\nin his armchair; his wife has followed his example; and a fat poodle,\r\nsnugly laid on a soft cushion before the fender, is dozing luxuriously;\r\nthe motto of the house is written over the mantel: 'Eating, drinking,\r\nand sleeping, with the generality of people, form the three important\r\narticles of life.' The blooming daughter, a melting young damsel,\r\nhas her own creed on the subject. An opportunity is offered for a\r\nlittle flirtation; a gallant and good-looking young buck is saluting\r\nher with a tender embrace; the pair have sat down to perform _duetto\r\nprestissimo_, but the swain's flute is discarded, and the fair pianist\r\nis negligently touching the keyboard to a lively air, _Lucy's Delight_,\r\nwhile the flirtation is proceeding undisturbed by the presence of the\r\nslumbering parents.\r\n\r\nPeter Plumb is a desirable father-in-law, and his commercial interests\r\nare set forth in 'a view of Wapping Docks,' and a plan, suspended on\r\nrollers, for the 'new improvement of the Cattle Market in Smithfield.'\r\n\r\nThe existence of the sleeper would appear an easy one; witness the\r\nextract from _Peter Plumb's Diary_. This honest man being of greater\r\nconsequence in his own thoughts than 'in the eye of the world,' had for\r\nsome years past kept a journal of his life. _Videlicet_, the following\r\nexciting example:--\r\n\r\n'_Monday._--Eight o'clock: I put on my clothes, washed hands and face.\r\nNine o'clock: Tied my knee-strings, put on my double-soled shoes,\r\ntook a walk to Islington. One o'clock: Took a luncheon. Between two\r\nand three returned. Dined on a knuckle of veal and bacon. Three: Nap\r\nas usual. Four to six: Walked in the fields. Wind S.S.E. From six to\r\nten: Went to the club; was half-an-hour before anybody else came. Ten\r\nat night: Went to bed. Slept without waking till nine next morning.\r\nTuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday: Little or no\r\nvariation.'\r\n\r\n_May 30, 1810._ _A Table d'Hôte, or French Ordinary in Paris._\r\n(20).--The _Table d'Hôte_ is an appropriate companion to the _Paris\r\nDiligence_. The travellers have duly reached the capital, and a scene\r\nof Parisian life is shown on their arrival in the French metropolis.\r\nThe _salle à manger_, where the ordinary is held, is a handsome\r\napartment, decorated in showy taste with enrichments in plaster,\r\ncanopies, curtains, mirrors, &c. The repast is in active course, and\r\nits humours are improved on with an observant eye. The company is\r\ndiversified; there are _bourgeois_ and their wives, _petits-maîtres_,\r\nmarquises, fat friars, and ladies of various degrees, all complaisance\r\nand graciousness. A Savoyard, with a hurdy-gurdy, and her daughter,\r\nwith a triangle, are 'discoursing sweet sounds' to enliven the repast.\r\nA dog is taught to beg for food. The manners of the feeders are of\r\ndifferent shades. Pledging toasts, flirtations, and small gallantries\r\nanimate the severer business of the hour. Several whimsical accidents\r\nare introduced, results of awkward or inattentive service on the part\r\nof waiters; one grave citizen is receiving a scalding _bouillon_ in his\r\neye, while a _bouilli_ is simultaneously poured over a bowing dandy; a\r\nglass of wine is capsized into a lady's plate while her attention is\r\ndiverted; and a piggish priest, whose soup is suffered to stream down\r\nthe corners of his fat jowl, has his shaven pate saluted by a cascade\r\nfrom a bottle tilted up by a heedless fair _domestique_, whose regards\r\nare engaged by the pleasantries of an amorous old fogey by her side,\r\nwith whom she is exchanging jocularities.\r\n\r\n1810 (?). _Paris Diligence._ Rowlandson del. et sculp. Published by T.\r\nTegg.--This print is one of a class somewhat superior to the average\r\nseries published in Cheapside. The scene is a favourite one with the\r\nartist, and his early experiences in France here serve him in valuable\r\nstead. It is in pictures of Continental life, before the aspects of the\r\nquaint and picturesque surroundings were entirely transmogrified by the\r\nFrench Revolution, that we recognise Rowlandson at his best. The value\r\nof these sketches is perhaps greater than of any other works his facile\r\nhand has bequeathed us, and the interest of these subjects is found to\r\nappeal to a larger circle of admirers.\r\n\r\nThe _diligence_ is starting from a massively built and handsome\r\ninnyard, the sign of the _Coq en Pâte_. The 'machine' is a cumbersome\r\nvehicle, clumsy and heavy to an incredible degree. It is drawn--at no\r\nrapid pace, it is certain--by four strong, long, ill-favoured steeds,\r\nharnessed with ropes to the Noah's Ark-like contrivance, and ridden\r\nby two postilions, who are cracking their long thonged whips without\r\nproducing much acceleration of speed in the toiling team. The timber of\r\nthe diligence would be heavy for a gun-carriage, and the construction\r\nof the entire concern is perfectly primitive. A huge basket in front,\r\nabout the size of a porter's lodge, is presumably the 'luggage boot;'\r\nbelow this are two small and heavy wheels, while at the other end\r\nof the machine are two enormous hind-wheels. The elongated body of\r\nthe vehicle seems also to be made of rough basket-work. Through the\r\nunglazed spaces for windows are seen the occupants, who are travelling\r\nPariswards: an assortment of corpulent and shaven monks, peasant\r\nwomen, and an old veteran with a formidable pigtail; a fashionable\r\nlady in feathers is ogling a beau wearing a powdered wig and enormous\r\n_solitaire_. The roof itself is also loaded; another fat friar, with\r\nshaven poll, is reading his book, over which is peeping a _débonnaire_\r\ndamsel of redundant charms, who is flirting a gigantic fan; an officer,\r\nwith an enormous cocked-hat and a massive club, has his hands in a muff\r\nof pantomimic magnitude; by his side is a lively _grisette_, with a\r\nparasol; another officer is reclining behind.\r\n\r\nThe _diligence_ is attended by the usual mendicants, vociferously\r\nappealing for alms. The background is a quaint French town of some\r\nimportance; a jack-booted rider is clattering along in the rear of\r\na travelling-carriage, which is posting to the capital, driven by a\r\npostilion. Down the street is shown a procession of well-fed friars;\r\nand a party of devout nuns are striking attitudes at the foot of a\r\ncarved figure. The whole picture recalls the precise aspect France wore\r\nat the time Sterne made his famous 'Sentimental Journey,' and the scene\r\nmight well be a chapter from that picturesque pilgrimage.\r\n\r\n_June 4, 1810._ _Love and Dust._ Published by T.

Tegg. Tegg's caricatures (22).--The artist has drawn\r\nthe fight, judging from the appearance offered by the opponents, during\r\nthe first round, while all was cool and scientific. The champions,\r\nstripped to the waist, are sparring round one another on guard; their\r\nseconds are eagerly following up the principals; the two bottle-holders\r\nare seated on the grass. The spectators, a very orderly company,\r\naccording to the picture, are arranged on the grass in a wide circle,\r\nwhile beyond the amateurs on foot is a ring of vehicles, on the roofs\r\nof which are perched the more fashionable portion of the patrons of the\r\nRing, amongst whom are seen some of the softer sex.\r\n\r\n'The concourse of people exceeded anything we have ever witnessed. The\r\nspectators were computed at ten thousand. At one o'clock the champions\r\nentered the ring, and Sam had for his second Harry Lee, whilst Joe Ward\r\nofficiated for Medley. After a severe and bloody contest of forty-nine\r\nrounds victory was decided in favour of Sam.'\r\n\r\n_August 8, 1810._ _Smuggling Out, or Starting from Gretna Green._\r\nRowlandson del. Schultz scul. Published by R. Ackermann, 101 Strand.--A\r\ngallant officer is assisting a pretty and precocious boarding-school\r\nmiss to elope from a balcony window; a post-chaise is waiting in\r\nreadiness to carry the fugitives 'across the Border,' and a servant\r\nin attendance has secured the damsel's personal belongings in a\r\nportmanteau on his shoulders.\r\n\r\n_August 8, 1810._ _Smuggling In, or a College Trick._--The picture\r\nrepresents the corner of a college quadrangle. Three festive and\r\nmischievously disposed collegians appear at the window of their rooms;\r\nwith the contrivance of a sling and a stout rope they are managing to\r\ndraw up, clandestinely, as they fondly imagine, a pretty, modish, and,\r\nwe fear, wanton maiden, who is not in the least terrified or abashed\r\nat her situation, but is entering into the spirit of the adventure.\r\nA frowning proctor, who is scandalised at these reprehensible\r\nirregularities, is standing in an angle, half-concealed in the shadow,\r\nscowling at the party, and waiting to dart out and surprise the\r\nviolators of the academical proprieties at the critical moment for\r\ntheir detection.\r\n\r\n_September 8, 1810._ _Procession of the Cod Company from St. Giles's to\r\nBillingsgate._ Published by T. Tegg (11).--A view of old Billingsgate,\r\noverlooking the river, with the fish being landed from the crowds of\r\nsmacks at the old covered jetty, since swept away. The pilgrimage\r\nof the sturdy members of _The Cod Company_, we presume, is made to\r\nthe craft on the river to take in cargoes of fish. The procession\r\nis composed of corpulent old Irish women, of colossal breadth and\r\nstrength, all balancing their fish-baskets on their heads, some smoking\r\ntheir cherished clay pipes, and carrying their stoutly developed arms\r\ncrossed, akimbo, or on their hips, after their individual proclivities.\r\n\r\n_September 25, 1810._ _Rigging out a Smuggler._ Published by T. Tegg\r\n(8).--A party of sailors in a cabin are fitting out a handsome young\r\ncreature to 'run the gauntlet' of the Custom-house officers, or rather\r\nto go on shore, with as full a cargo of excisable articles as they\r\ncan secure round her person. Huge pockets of 'old Japan china, tea,\r\ngum,' &c. are disposed round her waist, together with a small keg of\r\n'coniac,' and a flagon of otto of roses. Chests of Congou and Souchon\r\nand flasks of arrack are standings about.\r\n\r\n_September 30, 1810._ _Dramatic Demireps at their Morning Rehearsal._\r\nPublished by T. Tegg (10).--The intention of this burlesque is a\r\npun on _dram-atic_; the theatrical demireps being very ungallantly\r\ndisplayed in the Hundreds of Drury, inhabiting an attic, and indulging\r\nin matutinal potations of gin. The surroundings do not give a very\r\ncultivated idea of the actresses or their belongings. _The Chapter of\r\nAccidents_ seems to be the piece in rehearsal. The toilettes of the\r\nfair performers are shockingly neglected. Over the mantelpiece are\r\nvarious professional announcements 'for the benefit of the Theatrical\r\nFund,' &c. By the side of an '_À la mode_ beef jug' is a melon marked\r\n'Ripe--rotten,' and other ironical allusions to current scandals and\r\npersonages then well recognised are posted on the walls, as sketches\r\nfor portraits: _Peg and the Duke_, _Bald as a Coote_, _Little Darby O!\r\nEver Craving_, and _Old Q._, and various innuendoes hardly flattering\r\nto the originals indicated.\r\n\r\n_October 5, 1810._ _Sports of a Country Fair._ Part the First.\r\nPublished by T. Tegg.--The bustling picture of a country fair in full\r\noperation. In the rear are swings, booths, and theatrical shows. In the\r\nforeground is shown a cart overset; a man is holding on to the head of\r\nthe horse, which in rearing has snapped his girths and tilted the cart\r\non end, while the late occupants are thrown down in motley confusion,\r\nsprawling on the turf, pommelling, kicking, shrieking, and throwing up\r\ntheir limbs, while eager groups of spectators are hurrying up to enjoy\r\nthe disaster.\r\n\r\n_October 5, 1810._ _Sports of a Country Fair._ Part the Second.--A\r\nnearer view of the same fair: the thick of the crowd; stick-throwing\r\nfor snuffboxes, oyster-opening, pocket-picking, and a round-about\r\nswing; one of the boats is giving way, and a fair swinger and her swain\r\nare falling through. There is an inn where cordials are supplied,\r\nthrough the windows of which various scenes of love-making are visible.\r\nIn the distance may be seen Polito's stage-booths, horse-racing, and\r\nother diversions.\r\n\r\n_October, 1810._ _Sports of a Country Fair._ Part the Third.\r\nPublished by T. Tegg.--The interior of another booth-theatre; the\r\nplay is interrupted; the only performer on the stage is thrown into\r\nconsternation, and the whole of the audience are dispersing in terror\r\nat an unexpected intruder. A royal Bengal tiger has made his escape\r\nfrom an adjoining show, and is bounding through the canvas walls of\r\nthe theatrical booth, threatening to descend plump into the auditorium.\r\nThe effect on the frightened playgoers may be well imagined. Some are\r\nprostrate with terror; one man is down on his knees and cannot move\r\nfor fright; ladies are fainting; husbands are manfully endeavouring\r\nto carry off their wives out of the way of the terrible visitor, and\r\neverything is turned topsy-turvy.\r\n\r\n1810. _Sports of a Country Fair._--The sport in this case is\r\naccidental, and the amusement verges on peril of a terrible character.\r\nA temporary theatre, _Cockburn's Company_, is on fire, and the\r\nspectators are escaping as best they may. The entrance is from a\r\nbalcony reached by a flight of steps, and the frightened spectators are\r\npouring out of the building, which is burning furiously, and throwing\r\nthemselves pellmell down the steps, at the bottom of which they are\r\nsprawling, kicking, and plunging in fright and confusion. Certain buxom\r\ndamsels are climbing over the balustrade and dropping from the balcony,\r\nwith the musicians, into the arms of those below. A bill on the booth\r\nannounces the _Last Night, Pizarro_ and _Don Juan, A Shower of Real\r\nFire_, and _A View of the Infernal Regions_. Crowds are scudding\r\naway in the distance, and the other attractions of the fair are at a\r\nstandstill.\r\n\r\n_October 25, 1810._ _An Old Ewe Drest Lamb Fashion._ Published by T.\r\nTegg. A deceptive old tabby, clad in a juvenile style, is dashing\r\nalong in a high poke-bonnet; three or four Don Juans of eccentric\r\nexterior are hurrying after her to tender their attentions, an act of\r\ngallantry they are likely to regret on closer inspection. The quotation\r\noffered as _A Misery of Human Life_ runs thus: 'Walking fast and far to\r\novertake a woman from whose shape and air as viewed _en derrière_ you\r\nhave decided that her face is angelic, till, on eagerly turning round\r\nas you pass her, you are petrified by a Gorgon.'\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SPITFIRES.]\r\n\r\n_October 25, 1810._ _Spitfires._ Published by T.

A fire is roaring up the kitchen\r\ngrate, and a fat old cook, slumbering in an armchair drawn up to the\r\nkitchen table, has her feet resting on the chimneypiece, and a glass\r\nof 'cherry bounce' held in her chubby hand, to refresh her after\r\nthe exertions of the day. A younger and proportionately comely and\r\ncomfortable-looking kitchen-maid is also stealing 'forty winks,' with\r\nher head resting against the chimneypiece; while a fat black footman,\r\nwho completes this evidently easy-going household, is indulging in the\r\nluxury of repose and pillowing his slumbering woolly pate on the ample\r\nshoulders of his shapely neighbour.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A HIT AT BACKGAMMON.]\r\n\r\n_November 19, 1810._ _A Hit at Backgammon._ Published by T.

On the armchair of the ghastly sufferer leans a\r\npretty buxom girl in the flush of womanhood, who is wavering between\r\ngrief and rapture--tears for her departing relative and regard for\r\nthe caresses of the practitioner, who is dismissing his patient and\r\ncourting a bride at the same moment. While one hand of the perfidious\r\nDoctor is carelessly holding the pulse of the sinking woman his arm\r\nis thrown round the neck of the blooming maiden, his fat features are\r\nexpressive of maudlin tenderness, and his eyes are turned upwards in\r\nawkward admiration.\r\n\r\n_November 20, 1810._ _Bath Races._ Published by T.

The city of Bath is slightly\r\nindicated in the rear.\r\n\r\n_November 30, 1810._ _Doctor Drainbarrel conveyed Home in a\r\nWheelbarrow, in order to take his Trial for Neglect of Family Duty._\r\nPublished by T.

Tegg\r\n(24).--The Corporal has incautiously been paying a secret visit to a\r\nfine, plump and well-favoured damsel, on whose affections, it would\r\nseem, the man of war has no legitimate claim. The lady is snugly\r\ndisposing her lover in a strong-box, with iron clamps, probably the\r\nsea-chest of the lawful proprietor of the chamber. Before closing\r\nthe lid on the captive swain the buxom maid, at whose waist hangs\r\nthe key of the chest, is favouring the suitor with a parting kiss.\r\nAn old 'salt,' his few remaining hairs bristling with indignation\r\nand resentment, is looking in at the window and surveying the entire\r\ntransaction before making his entrance on the scene. That the Corporal\r\nhas fairly got into the 'wrong box' is further hinted by a trap at his\r\nside, in which an unfortunate rat is securely imprisoned.\r\n\r\n1810. _The Harmonic Society. 'The Assemblies of women are too\r\nfrequently marked by malice to each other, and slander of the absent;\r\nthe meetings of men by noise, inebriety, and wrangling.'_--A companion\r\nscene to _The Breaking up of a Blue Stocking Club_ (March 1, 1815).\r\nThe direst disorder, according to the plate, is proceeding around on\r\nall sides: the conflict of fists, aided by such aggressive articles\r\nas bottles, the fireirons, and any offensive weapon that may come to\r\nhand, is raging free and furious. The president of this _harmonic\r\nmeeting_ is very naturally employing his hammer to bring the turbulent\r\nto order, by using it as an instrument to knock down his opponents.\r\nWigs are sent flying 'through space,' chairs are wrecked; decanters,\r\nspirit-bottles, punchbowls, and such frail objects as tumblers,\r\nrummers, and wine-glasses, are involved in universal destruction.\r\nOne elated youthful hero has jumped on the table in a tipsy frolic;\r\nhe is promoting the further confusion which darkness will entail by\r\ndeliberately smashing up the candles, and battering the sconces of the\r\nchandelier with the assistance of a punch-ladle.\r\n\r\n1810. _The Sign of the Four Alls._--The four personages who constitute\r\nthis famous view of the relative estates of the realm stand under\r\nniches; the head of the State is the first represented; and next, of\r\ncourse, is the Church; then the powers militant; and lastly, as a sort\r\nof necessary evil, the commonalty--perhaps better kept out of sight\r\naltogether, since the presence of the representative of this portion\r\nof the empire is not acknowledged by the other three, his pastors\r\nand masters. Number one, George the Third; the King in this case is\r\nrepresented strutting in awful but somewhat awkward majesty. To quote a\r\nnational but lowly authority, Giles Grinagain:--\r\n\r\n    What! he the King? Why, that chap there?\r\n    Why, I saw a king at Bartholomew Fair\r\n    More like a king than that chap there!\r\n\r\nThe Bishop, a snug ecclesiastic, a remnant possibly of the bad old\r\nschool of the Clarke preferments, all wig, lawn sleeves, mitre, and\r\ncrozier, is raising his fat hands with sanctimonious import--'I pray\r\nfor all.' As to the soldier, the military officer drawn by Rowlandson\r\nrather reminds one of Colonel Wardle, whose person the caricaturist had\r\nmade a little too familiar--'I fight for all;' and lastly comes John\r\nBull, under his agricultural aspect, a simple farmer, with his smock,\r\nhay-fork, and dog, and, what is more to the purpose, his bag of 'hard\r\nearnings' in his hand, on the strength of which he is admitted to join\r\nthe quartette--on sufferance, it is palpable--'I pay for all!'[22]\r\n\r\n1810 (?). _The Rabbit Merchant._ Published by T. Tegg (25).--The view\r\nof a country street; a rabbit seller, with a selection of his stock\r\non his pole, is offering a choice to an old dame, who is somewhat\r\nhypercritical, and is employing a test which the rabbit merchant\r\nconsiders excessive and uncalled for; he is represented as offering\r\n'the retort courteous' in justification of his goods.\r\n\r\n1810 (?). _A Sale of English Beauties in the East Indies._--Although,\r\nas we have noticed, Rowlandson's work was stamped by the strongest\r\noriginality, he, like other etchers of caricatures, often executed\r\nthe ideas or worked out the first impressions of less experienced\r\ndraughtsmen; however, unlike most engravers, he has left, in his\r\nnumerous plates after Wigstead, Woodward, Bunbury, Nixon, Newton,\r\n&c. (in all cases the name of the originator is given), but slight\r\ntraces of the defects and shortcomings of the amateur artists whose\r\nsketches he has put into circulation, the major part of the engravings\r\nbearing unmistakable and easily recognised evidence of Rowlandson's\r\nindividuality. In the case of the present caricature he has, in some\r\ndegree, departed from this practice, probably at the desire of the\r\npublisher of the print, and has gone to Gillray's large and spirited\r\nplate entitled _A Sale of English Beauties in the East Indies_ for\r\nthe materials of his version of the same subject. It is noticeable,\r\nhowever, that while he has, in a free-handed manner, preserved the\r\nchief points and indeed most of the figures of the original (published\r\nMarch 16, 1786), he has forborne to put his own name to the copy.\r\nIt is probable that the original version was, at the date of the\r\nsmaller copy, in demand and difficult to purchase, and, to satisfy the\r\nrequirements of both publishers and public, Rowlandson has etched this\r\nsecond edition of his friend's plate, Gillray having unhappily lost his\r\nreason at the date of the republication.\r\n\r\nThe scene is supposed to be drawn from one of the landing-places in the\r\nEast Indies. A merchantman has arrived with a cargo which has proved\r\na source of excitement and attraction to residents of all classes.\r\nThe fair sex being in great apparent request, a shipload of English\r\nbeauties on arriving in the East would naturally produce commotion and\r\ncompetition among natives and foreigners alike. A dapper auctioneer\r\nis mounted on a bale of books lately arrived, a similar package forms\r\nhis desk, and he is knocking down a very attractive article, which\r\nseems likely to bring a handsome figure. A fine tall beauty is under\r\nthe scrutiny of a rich Nabob; a young officer is trying to win her\r\near, and an envoy from the Government, with instructions in his pocket\r\nfrom the Governor-General, is calculating the lady's height with his\r\nwalking-stick held as a measure. Similar incidents are represented\r\naround; the Rajahs are inspecting the latest importations with true\r\nmerchant-like caution; sundry bargains have already been secured,\r\nand in the scales is shown a method of approximating valuations; a\r\nwell-favoured arrival of the florid and fully developed type is set\r\nagainst a corresponding weight of 'lacs of rupees.' In the background\r\nis pictured a large warehouse for 'unsaleable goods from Europe--to be\r\nreturned by the next ship'--and several damsels are in great distress\r\nat being forced to take refuge within this unpopular establishment.\r\n\r\n1810. _A Parody on Milton._ Published by T.

The ancient dotard is making a parody on the quotation: 'On\r\nshe came--such as I saw her in my dream. _Grease_ was in all her\r\nsteps--Geneva in her hand; and every gesture reeling ripe for fun!'\r\n\r\n_Circa 1810._ _Cries of London._ Thirty plates.\r\n\r\n1810.

'In Holland, in the seventeenth century, it was used, but\r\nthe king was left out, and a lawyer added. Each person said exactly the\r\nsame as our signboards, but the farmer answered:--\r\n\r\n    You may fight, you may pray, you may plead,\r\n    But I am the farmer who lays the eggs--\r\n\r\n_i.e._ finds the money.\r\n\r\n'This enumeration of the various performances coupled with the word\r\n_all_ has been used in numerous different epigrams; an address to James\r\nthe First, in the Ashmolean MSS., No. 1730, has:-\r\n\r\n    _The Lords_ craveth all,\r\n    _The Queene_ granteth all,\r\n    _The Ladies_ of honour ruleth all,\r\n    _The Lord-Keeper_ sealed all,\r\n    _The Intelligencer_ marred all,\r\n    _The Parliament_ pass'd all,\r\n    _He that is gone_ opposed himself to all,\r\n    _The Bishops_ soothed all,\r\n    _The Judges_ pardoned all,\r\n    _The Lords_ buy, Rome spoil'd all,\r\n    Now, _Good King_, mend all,\r\n    Or else _The Devil_ will have all.\r\n\r\n'This again seems to have been imitated from a similar description of\r\nthe state of Spain in Greene's _Spanish Masquerade_, 1589:--\r\n\r\n    _The Cardinals_ solicit all,\r\n    _The King_ grauntes all,\r\n    _The Nobles_ confirm all,\r\n    _The Pope_ determines all,\r\n    _The Clergie_ disposeth all,\r\n    _The Duke of Medina_ hopes for all,\r\n    _Alonzo_ receives all,\r\n    _The Indians_ minister all,\r\n    _The Soldiers_ eat all,\r\n    _The People_ paie all,\r\n    _The Monks and Friars_ consume all,\r\n    And _the Devil_ at length will carry away all.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1811.\r\n\r\n\r\n_January 18, 1811._ _College Pranks, or Crabbed Fellows Taught to\r\nCaper on the Slack Rope._ Published by T.

Published\r\nby T. Tegg (54).--The interior of a parish church. Of the occupants of\r\na family-pew in the foreground the elders are sleeping, while a fair\r\nyoung worshipper's thoughts are evidently wandering; the attentions of\r\none or two buckish youths, seated in the vicinity, seem to be centred\r\non the lady; the clerk is snoring at his desk, regardless of the podgy\r\nand somewhat excited preacher over his head, who is quite absorbed in\r\nhis sermon, which does not seem to interest anyone but the deliverer.\r\n\r\n_February 12, 1811._ _A Midwife going to a Labour._ Tegg's Caricatures\r\n(55).--The stout old nurse, a body of balloon-like expansiveness, is\r\nhurrying off, summoned to her duties, at an unearthly hour of the\r\nmorning. Her head-gear is flowing about in the wind, her hood and cape\r\nare caught by the gale; a lantern is held in one hand, a brandy-bottle\r\nand a bundle, containing her luggage, are cuddled up in the other, and\r\nshe is mounted on pattens. The night-watchman is dozing in his box, and\r\na shivering chimney-sweeping lad is crouching along to his early toil,\r\nwith brushes and bags.\r\n\r\n_February 16, 1811._ _The Gig-Shop, or Kicking up a Breeze at Nell\r\nHamilton's Hop._ Published by T. Tegg.--According to the picture of\r\nthis place of 'fast' resort, dancing has given way to much rougher\r\ndiversions, and, although the musicians are in their gallery,\r\nplaying away as if the scene below was the regular thing, the place\r\nappropriated for the dance is given up to a _mill_ conducted on\r\nstrikingly professional principles; one of the combatants has 'peeled'\r\nin recognised style, and his opponent has stripped to his shirt;\r\nthe backers and seconders of the fisticuffing bucks (who are freely\r\nbesprinkled with the ruby fluid) are members of the fair sex; in fact,\r\nladies seem in the ascendant at this entertainment. A ring of delighted\r\nspectators are enjoying the fight and the fun from the benches, while\r\nother gentlemen are prudently engaged in restraining their fair\r\npartners from getting mixed up in the squabble which is raging fast\r\nand furious, thick and general, behind the two 'milling' gentlemen;\r\nladies using their fists manfully, kicking, tearing hair, and throwing\r\nthemselves into desperate warfare with terrific confusion and effect.\r\nIn the foreground a fair nymph of interesting but dishevelled\r\nappearance, probably the _friend_ of one of the combatants, is falling\r\ninto a fainting fit, from which the attentions of those who surround\r\nher seem inadequate to restore her to consciousness.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PIGEON-HOLE.]\r\n\r\n_February 20, 1811._ _Pigeon Hole, a Covent Garden Contrivance to Coop\r\nthe Gods._ Published by T. Tegg (57).--The miseries consequent on heat\r\nand crowding in a restricted space, as displayed in the Pigeon Hole\r\nGalleries of John Kemble's newly-constructed Drury Lane Theatre, gave\r\nrise to the present caricature, which is further explained under the\r\nhead of _This is the House that Jack Built_ (Sept. 27, 1809), and _The\r\nBoxes_ (Dec. 12, 1809). General dissatisfaction was expressed by all\r\nbut the privileged subscribers; the lessee's treatment of the humble\r\nsupporters of the drama, the frequenters of the gallery, gave special\r\noffence; and the illiberality of the management which provided such\r\ndisgraceful accommodation for its patrons was resented by the unruly\r\nproceedings known as the _O. P. Riots_, which marked the public sense\r\nof the transaction.\r\n\r\n_February 26, 1811._ _A French Dentist Showing a Specimen of his\r\nArtificial Teeth and False Palates._ Published by T. Tegg (58).--It\r\nis not easy to determine whether this caricature was intended solely\r\nas a satire or as an advertisement for some dental professor who was\r\nestablished here at the time. In Rowlandson's day, however, false\r\nteeth were sufficient novelties to be welcome subjects for ridicule.\r\nAn overgrown and exuberantly corpulent female is serving as a sample\r\nof the Frenchman's skill; her widely distended mouth is liberally\r\ndisplaying a wonderful set of masticators. The professor is the typical\r\nforeigner of the period, wearing hair-powder, a bag-wig, and earrings.\r\nAn old beau, looking through a quizzing-glass, is admiring the prospect\r\nof securing a decent set of teeth, his own gums exhibiting a very\r\nragged and defective regiment. An advertisement in the rear sets forth:\r\n'_Mineral Teeth._--Monsieur De Charmant, from Paris, engages to affix\r\nfrom one tooth to a whole set, without pain. Monsieur D. can also affix\r\nan artificial palate or a glass eye in a manner peculiar to himself; he\r\nalso distils, &c., &c.'\r\n\r\n_March, 1811._ _Bacon-faced Fellows of Brazen-Nose Broke Loose._\r\nPublished by T. Tegg (59).--The persons of learned members of the\r\nUniversities were not treated with a sparing hand by the satirist.\r\nRowlandson has introduced various incidents of college life into his\r\ncaricatures; but, throughout the series, the waggishly-inclined artist\r\ndoes not, we are afraid, exhibit any particular respect for _Alma\r\nMater_. The Fellows of Brasenose are drawn, with unusual unction,\r\nissuing from their Hall and through the archways of the Colleges,\r\ndressed in their academic guise, and pouring forth like a sable stream\r\nof erudition. The various expressions and attitudes of the 'big-wigs'\r\nare vastly well hit off; their diversified peculiarities of face or\r\nmotion are full of comicality. These grave sons of the Church are\r\nnot free from gallant considerations--a buxom wench, with a basket\r\nof fruit slung round her shapely neck, is the centre of attraction;\r\nthe 'Bacon-faced Fellows' are crowded around, bargaining for her ware\r\nand leering at the seller with undisguised and clumsy admiration. A\r\nreflection is cast on the _Vice_-Chancellor, who is vainly endeavouring\r\nto steal into his apartments without being detected by the rest of the\r\nsly grinning Fellows, with a weighty folio under his arm, and followed\r\nby an engaging young fruiteress, a lump of rustic innocence, bearing\r\nher baskets, for better selection from the contents, to the seclusion\r\nof the Vice's study.\r\n\r\n_March 10, 1811._ _She Stoops to Conquer._ Published by T. Tegg\r\n(61).--The central room of a prison. Various strong doors and\r\niron-grated windows open on the chamber. Bolts, padlocks, and strings\r\nof fetters indicate the nature of the security. Behind a grating is\r\nseen a prisoner, on whose behalf a buxom damsel is supposed to 'stoop\r\nto conquer,' since by dint of a plentiful repast, renewed strong\r\npotations, and those tender cajoleries which are believed to be the\r\nspecial weapons of the fair, the lady is evidently endeavouring to\r\ngain possession of the precious keys which will enable her to set her\r\nimprisoned swain at liberty.\r\n\r\n_March 12, 1811._ _The Anatomist._ Published by T. Tegg (60).--The\r\nmeaning of this print is not very obvious. It may be assumed that\r\nDr. Sawbones has secured a new subject; but whether an admirer of\r\nthe anatomist's lady has had himself conveyed into her presence by\r\nsimulating death, or changing places with the 'subject,' does not\r\nappear. However, the critical situation of the lively gentleman on\r\ntrestles does not seem conducive to a tranquil frame of mind; the\r\noperator is deliberately getting out his saws, knives, scissors, and\r\nother repellent anatomical instruments in a business-like spirit,\r\nfor he has, according to an announcement, to deliver _A Course of\r\nAnatomical Lectures, accompanied with Dissections_, and he is in want\r\nof a subject for demonstration. The lady, filled with the direst\r\napprehensions, is trying to impress on the anatomist the remarkable and\r\nunusual fact that the dead man has returned to life.\r\n\r\n_March 16, 1811._ _Sailors on Horseback._ Published by T. Tegg\r\n(62).--This print is one of the numerous instances of subjects designed\r\nby amateurs and given to Rowlandson to engrave, and, in most respects,\r\nto put into shape. According to the humours of this print four sailors,\r\nmounted on horseback, are going off on an equestrian cruise by the\r\nseashore. The British Tar most at his ease has been lashed with strong\r\ncables to the back of his steed beyond a chance of drifting loose:\r\n'Here I come, my hearties, right and tight--smart sailing; but never\r\nmind that--I can't be cast away, for my commander, Heavens bless him,\r\nhas lashed me to the deck with some tough old cables!' His neighbour,\r\nwho has a restive horse, requests, 'Keep more to the starboard, and be\r\nd---- to you; don't you see how you make my vessel run ahead!' A third,\r\nriding behind, is mounted on an animal who is taking into his head to\r\nlaunch out in the rear: 'D---- me, how she heaves; why, this is worse\r\nthan a jolly-boat in the Bay of Biscay!' A comrade, having had a spill,\r\nhas been left on the road, and is in danger of being run over: 'Mind\r\nwhat you are at, messmates, for I am upset, and the frigate I came on\r\nboard of has been under way without me this half-hour.'\r\n\r\n_March 28, 1811._ _Kitty Careless in Quod, or Waiting for Jew Bail._\r\nPublished by T. Tegg (65).--A dashing young lady of fashion, who has\r\nevidently been running ahead of the constable, is 'laid by the heels'\r\nin a spunging-house; the apartment in which she is lodged belongs,\r\nit appears from a printed notice on the wall, to _MacNab, Sheriff's\r\nOfficer for the County of Middlesex--genteel accommodation for ladies\r\nand gentlemen_. Heavy locks and bolts to the door, and massive bars\r\nto the window, indicate the security of Kitty's keeping. The fair\r\ncaptive does not seem depressed by her confinement: seated before a\r\nglowing fire, her legs crossed in easy indifference, the prisoner is\r\ndrinking bumpers of port wine with her captors; a spectacle by no means\r\nunusual in the days of this publication, when the extravagances of\r\npeople of fashion were constantly leading them to the confinement of a\r\nspunging-house.\r\n\r\n_April 1, 1811._ _Pastime in Portugal, or a Visit to the Nunneries._\r\nPublished by T. Tegg (64).--The principal figure in this picture is\r\nthat of a young officer belonging to the British army opposed to the\r\nFrench legions on the Peninsula; in company with a Portuguese don he\r\nhas come to visit one of the nunneries which were sufficiently abundant\r\nin the country; three well-favoured members of the sisterhood and a\r\nsour-looking old harridan, by way of duenna, have come to the 'grill,'\r\nor large grated window, which was employed to cut off the 'cloistered\r\nones' from the rest of the world. We are able to gather from the\r\nillustrations of the period that travellers were accustomed to make\r\nvisits to nunneries, where they purchased objects manufactured by the\r\ninmates, who were regarded by our countrymen as a kind of show; the\r\nvisitors, however, were always restricted to the outside of the grating\r\nwhich separated the sisterhood from more intimate association with\r\na wicked world. In Rowlandson's sketch the pretty nuns are offering\r\nsilk purses, of their own knitting, to their dashing visitor, whose\r\nattention is more exclusively occupied by the very decided personal\r\nattractions of the fair recluses.\r\n\r\n_April 5, 1811._ _The Last Drop._ Published by T. Rowlandson, 1 James\r\nStreet, Adelphi.--A short and corpulent _bon-vivant_, not unlike a\r\nballoon in figure, whose waistband has been abnormally distended by\r\nthe bibulous propensities of the owner, is standing on tiptoe tilting\r\nup to his eager lips a huge punchbowl, too well filled to be lifted\r\nbodily; he is transferring the contents to his own inside with much\r\ngusto. While the veteran and inordinate toper is greedily engulfing\r\nhis last bumping measure he is too busily engaged in the important\r\nwork in hand to notice that _Death_, in his bony personality as a\r\nghastly skeleton, is helping to raise the finishing bowl, while the\r\nfatal dart is poised over his head, ready for the stroke which will\r\nfollow this last potation before the tippler has time to recover his\r\nbreath. The stout gentleman has evidently enjoyed a lengthy innings,\r\nand, from the instances scattered about him, he has made the most of\r\nhis opportunities; he is surrounded by the remnants of the good and bad\r\nthings with which he has made away--barrels of stout, bottles of port,\r\npuncheons of _usquebaugh_, and spirits of all sorts; in fact, a very\r\ncellar of the strong drinks which in his day have fallen to the share\r\nof the departing toper.\r\n\r\n_April 9, 1811._ _Boney the Second, or the Little Baboon Created to\r\nDevour French Monkeys._ Published by T. Tegg.--'Boneyparte,' in his\r\ngeneral's uniform, is seated before the fire, making caudle--of French\r\nblood--for the infant prince; a row of sovereign-crowns, wrested from\r\nthe wearers, are ranged on the mantelpiece. Napoleon's heir, the\r\nminiature of his sire, with the addition of a monkey's tail, is tearing\r\nand clawing at his parent, and is held on a cushion placed outside the\r\nImperial cradle, which is inscribed _Devil's Darling_. Napoleon is\r\nharanguing in his usual grandiose style: 'Rejoice, ye Frenchmen; the\r\nfruits of my labour has produced a little image of myself. I shall,\r\nfor the love I owe your country, instil in my noble offspring the same\r\nprinciples of lying, thieving, treachery, letchery, murder, and all\r\nother foul deeds, for which I am now worshipped and adored!' The Pope\r\nis kneeling by his side, and pronouncing by way of a benediction over\r\nthe infant:--\r\n\r\n    The owl shriek'd at thy birth, an evil sight;\r\n    The night-crow cry'd, foreboding luckless time;\r\n    Dogs howl'd, and hideous tempests shook down trees;\r\n    The raven rock'd her on the chimney-top,\r\n    And chattering pies in dismal discord sung.\r\n\r\n_April 10, 1811._ _A Picture of Misery._ Published by T. Tegg\r\n(70).--The bare and chilling chamber is occupied by a leaden-hued and\r\nsordid-looking miser, opposite to whom is seated an individual of\r\nstarved aspect; a pinched and shrivelled old beldame is seen at the\r\ndoor. A table of interest is the only literature the room can boast.\r\nThe miser is crouching before the grate, and snuffing out the single\r\ncandle for economy. Above the usurer hangs his own portrait; he is\r\npainted congenially occupied in weighing guineas; a list of securities,\r\n'Stock Ex., Bank Stock, 3 per Cents., Imperial, Omnium, South Sea,\r\nExchequer, Lottery,' &c., recalls sweet reflections. Below are the\r\nlines:--\r\n\r\n    Iron was his chest, iron was his door;\r\n    His hand was iron, and his heart was more.\r\n\r\n_April 12, 1811._ _Puss in Boots, or General Junot taken by Surprise._\r\nRowlandson del. Published by T. Tegg (71).--A dashing young damsel has\r\nsecured the jack-boots, cocked-hat, and long sword of General Junot,\r\nand is assuming valiant airs, dressed in these borrowed plumes, and\r\nthreatening the French commander--who is helpless and in bed--with his\r\nown weapons.\r\n\r\n_April 14, 1811._ _Nursing the Spawn of a Tyrant, or Frenchmen Sick\r\nof the Breed._ Published by T. Tegg.--The Empress of the French is\r\nin consternation at the precocious fury of her progeny, who, with an\r\norb in one hand and a dagger in the other, is threatening destruction\r\naround; while the Emperor is listening behind a curtain; the pope and\r\nother Roman-Catholic hierarchs are offering 'composing draughts,' and\r\nsuggesting to send the infantine monster to his supposed diabolical\r\n'grandpapa' as quickly as possible. The Empress is thus proclaiming the\r\nterrors of her situation: 'There's no condition sure so curst as mine!\r\nDay and night to dandle such a dragon--the little angry cur snarls\r\nwhile it feeds; see how the blood is settled in his scarecrow face;\r\nwhat brutal mischief sits upon his brow. Rage and vengeance sparkle in\r\nhis cheeks; the very spawn and spit of its tyrant father. Nay, now I\r\nlook again, he is the very picture of his grandfather, _the Devil_!'\r\n\r\n_April 20, 1811._ _The Enraged Son of Mars and the Timid Tonsor._\r\nPublished by T. Tegg (67).--The picture represents the interior of a\r\nbarber's shop, a favourite subject with the caricaturists. A stout\r\ncustomer is expressing slaughterous intentions; a choleric old boy,\r\nprobably an officer of the Militia, with the shaving-cloth round\r\nhis short neck, is vowing vengeance on the head of the frightened\r\nbarber, who has been so _maladroit_ as to carve a tolerable gash in\r\nthe veteran's round cheek. The tonsor's wife, who is also engaged\r\nin the business, is, while holding the soap-bowl and lather, thrown\r\ninto consternation at the uproar raised by the damaged client. An\r\nassistant, who is employed in cutting the hair of another customer,\r\nis equally distracted, and, in his trepidation, is threatening the\r\nears of his unconscious subject. The barber's monkey--for barbers have\r\nin all time enjoyed the credit of being fanciers of live stock--is\r\nlathering his head at a toilette-table, in imitation of the actions\r\nof a venerable personage who has just had his head shaved. Various\r\nblocks, with their attendant wigs, are ranged round the shelves of the\r\nshop, telling of the day when a gentleman's head of hair was sent out\r\nto be dressed, while he kept a change of wigs for convenience-sake;\r\nhere we find parsons' blocks, clerks' blocks, doctors' blocks, lawyers'\r\nblocks, and other professional 'caxons,' the heads of the learned\r\nbeing distinguished by their respective wigs. Various sketches appear\r\non the walls, the subjects being selected with a view to their trade\r\nappositeness. One picture represents the fate of Absalom, delivered to\r\ndestruction by his luxuriant locks: 'O Absalom, my son, my son! hadst\r\nthou wore a wig this ne'er had happened,' &c., &c.\r\n\r\n_April 24, 1811._ _Rural Sports. Cat in a Bowl._ No. 1.--The pastimes\r\nof our forefathers, before the establishment of Humane Societies\r\nfor the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, were too frequently of a\r\nbarbarous description, and the cruelties then tolerated for mere sport\r\nwere undoubtedly most reprehensible. The caricaturist has contrived\r\nto surround these wanton displays with an air of hilarity, and the\r\nspectacle of a 'cat in a bowl,' apart from the brutality of the fun, is\r\nnot without its whimsical attractions. A favourite cat, the property\r\nof a distracted spinster, has been launched upon the water in a bowl,\r\nwhich is shown spinning round with the current, to the terror of\r\nthe involuntary voyager, whose dread of immersion combined with her\r\nexertions to escape from this embarrassing situation, which threatens\r\nto capsize the treacherous craft at every turn, seem to afford the\r\nfrivolous audience unqualified amusement. A lad is seated on the bank,\r\nwith a girl by his side--probably the authors of the mischief--holding\r\na barking dog, ready to attack the frightened creature if she comes too\r\nnear the shore. Parties taking the air in chaises, and promenaders, the\r\nloiterers from the alehouse, pipe in hand, and various rustic groups\r\ngathered round the brink, are intensely diverted at the scene. Not so\r\nthe owner of the cat; the horrified old maid, rendered desperate by the\r\nprecarious situation of her pet, is pulling up her skirts and plunging\r\nforward in a vain endeavour to reach the slippery bowl, which is out\r\nof her reach; while a second old lady is doing her best to assist\r\nher friend. A little further down the bank the artist has introduced\r\nanother reckless episode; a pair of horses are running away with a\r\ntandem, which is being overturned, and the driver and a stout female by\r\nhis side are just on the point of being tumbled out without ceremony.\r\n\r\n_May 1, 1811._ _A Dog Fight._--There is a note on the proof impression\r\nof this plate in the writer's collection, to the effect that the\r\nprint was never published. The spectacle represented is remarkably\r\nanimated; the various incidents of the brutal exhibition are seized\r\nwith a masterly hand; the enthusiasm and excitement of the audience\r\nare done full justice to. Drinking, betting, squabbling, an irregular\r\nscrimmage, picking of pockets, and similar humours are treated with due\r\nappreciation. The backers of the losing dog are thrown into dismay, as\r\ntheir faces sufficiently indicate; while the satisfaction which fills\r\nthe supporters of the winning side is well expressed. The spirit of\r\nthe picture is much increased by the introduction of numerous dogs,\r\nferocious-looking 'varmints,' struggling to join the fray, and only\r\nheld back from the stage of conflict by the most desperate exertions\r\non the part of their owners; these combatively-minded animals are\r\nprobably the heroes of coming tournays. The scene of this cruel sport,\r\nsince made unlawful, is probably the 'Westminster pit,'[23] where\r\nsuch spectacles were constantly held, and attended by persons of rank\r\nand fashion, as well as by the dregs of the sporting and dog-fancying\r\nfraternities, whose presence, as shown in the study, is tolerably\r\nmarked.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A DOG FIGHT.]\r\n\r\n_May 1, 1811._ _Touch for Touch, or a Female Physician in Full\r\nPractice._--The figure of the fair practitioner is highly spirited,--a\r\nhandsome young female, whose person is set off with all the allurements\r\nof fine clothes, well-dressed hair, and waving plumes. A decrepit and\r\ntoothless patient is evidently grateful to the doctress; he is filling\r\nthe hand of the distinguished physician with gold-pieces before she\r\nleaves the apartment, or more properly consulting-room, which is\r\nfurther set off with a picture of Danae collecting a shower of gold.\r\n\r\n_May 4, 1811._ _Who's Mistress Now?_ Republished.

The proprietor has returned\r\nwith provisions for a merry-making; a porter bearing on his head a\r\nbasket containing geese, fowls, fish, and fruit, with a flask of wine\r\nin his hand. The old curmudgeon's crutch is leaning against the door,\r\nand he is fumbling over the immense padlock, quite unconscious that a\r\nsmart young officer, who has placed a ladder against the window of his\r\nlovely inamorata's apartment, is helping the captive bird to freedom\r\nfrom the clutches of her jealous jailer.\r\n\r\n_August 30, 1811._ _Masquerading._ Published by T.

Prominent among the maskers is a\r\nlady-magician, with her divining-wand and a book of the 'black art,'\r\nconfronting a nondescript necromancer and his zany. There is a\r\nnobleman wearing horns as a becoming decoration for his head; and our\r\nold friend Punchinello, with a guitar, putting himself into grotesque\r\ncontortions. There is a composite personage, a kind of _Janus_, an\r\nestablished feature in old _bal masqués_, one side male and the other\r\nfemale. There is a Folly, a councillor, and the usual attendance of\r\ndominos, masquers, and characters, whose disguises are of a speculative\r\ndescription.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MASQUERADING.]\r\n\r\n_September, 1811._ _Accommodation Ladder._ Published by T.

For his\r\naccommodation, that he may be able to reach her countenance within\r\nhailing distance, the lady, who is more than twice the height of her\r\nadmirer, is holding a ladder ready for his ascent.

A comely young female, seated\r\nin an armchair at the window, is pointing out the phenomenon to the\r\ngazer; meanwhile a youthful gallant, on his knees beside the lady, is\r\nsqueezing her hand, tenderly pressing her foot, and otherwise striving\r\nto enlist her interest by a demonstrative display of affection.\r\n\r\n_September 25, 1811._ _Life and Death of the Race Horse._ Published\r\nby T. Tegg (90).--This print is divided into six stages. The first\r\nrepresents the foal by the side of his dam; in the second he is\r\npictured as a racer on the course in all the pride of strength and\r\nbeauty, blood and limb. In the third stage he has come down to a\r\nhunter; from thence, with old age fast approaching, he is used to run\r\nin a postchaise. In the fifth plate we find the whilom racehorse grown\r\naged and broken down, and condemned to end his wretched days belaboured\r\nas a pack-horse. In the last stage the racehorse's career is brought\r\ndown to his death, and a huntsman has purchased his carcass to feed his\r\npack.\r\n\r\n_September 29, 1811._ _Rural Sports.

It lasted\r\nnineteen minutes and ten seconds, and was decisive in favour of Cribb._\r\nRowlandson del. Published by T. Tegg.--The point from which the picture\r\nis taken affords a good view of the combat, which is about concluded.\r\nCribb, a massively-built boxer, is dealing the black champion such a\r\nfelling blow as, judging from the dismay expressed in the faces of\r\nthe two supporters of Molineaux, one of whom is also a man of colour,\r\nwill leave the victory in the hands of the striker, whose backer\r\nand bottle-holder are in raptures. Round the raised platform which\r\nconstitutes the ring is gathered a very animated throng, amidst which\r\nthe artist has depicted the various popular incidents of pushing,\r\nstruggling, climbing on shoulders, quarrelling, picking pockets,\r\ncheering, and resenting the encroachments of men on horseback. A\r\nprize-fight would seem to have been an institution in fashion at the\r\nbeginning of the century; the streams of vehicles, coaches, tandems,\r\ncurricles, and every contrivance 'on wheels' which surround the stage\r\nand line the background give the scene the appearance of a Derby\r\ncourse. The presence of the fair sex, who seem to appreciate the\r\nperformance, keeps up the animation of the picture.\r\n\r\n_October 1, 1811._ _Rural Sports. Smock Racing._ Published by T.

Various\r\nloving couples are disporting themselves on benches and at round-tables\r\nby the alehouse door. The village cobblers, blacksmiths, tailors,\r\nbutchers, &c., are neglecting their trades to follow the game; their\r\ninjured wives have come to reduce the careless husbands to a proper\r\nsense of their duties. One shrewish spouse, leaning over the paling, is\r\nflourishing a broom with a force of arms that threatens to astonish her\r\ngood man, whose attention is occupied in the game. Over the head of the\r\nvictim is a board, _Washing and mangling done here_.

A group of\r\nwicked old roysterers are delighted with the prospect of the swinging\r\nhoyden--their pipes and bowls are neglected in their rapturous\r\nattention to the evolutions of the fair occupant of the swing, and\r\ntheir indignant wives are vainly endeavouring to recall them to a sense\r\nof propriety.\r\n\r\n1811. _Twelfth Night Characters_, in twenty-four figures, by T.\r\nRowlandson.\r\n\r\n_October, 1811._ _Rural Sports, or a Cricket Match Extraordinary._\r\nPublished by T. Tegg (96).--On Wednesday, Oct. 3, 1811, a cricket\r\nmatch took place at Balls Pond, Newington. The players on both sides\r\nwere women--11 Hampshire against 11 Surrey. The match was made between\r\ntwo noblemen amateurs of the respective counties for 500 guineas\r\na side. The performers in the contest were of all ages and sizes.\r\nSuch a subject in the hands of Rowlandson afforded almost unbounded\r\nopportunities for the exercise of his grotesque talents and his command\r\nof figure-drawing. The scene is a busy one, as may be conceived; a\r\ncertain artistic freedom has been assumed, and there is a liberal\r\ndisplay of limbs in all directions, the skirts of the cricketers being\r\ntucked up for convenience of motion; the performers, however, seem\r\nto enter into the contest with spirit, if not skill. Balls Pond, as\r\nseen in the engraving, is a fair open country, without a trace of a\r\nsolitary habitation. A spacious tent, in the background, is erected\r\nfor the _Jolly Cricketers_, wherein the noble patrons of the sport are\r\nfortifying the players with huge bowls of punch, restoratives which do\r\nnot appear to promote the most orderly proceedings.\r\n\r\n  1811 (?). _The Jockey Club, or Newmarket Meeting_ (111)\r\n           (Betting Room).\r\n\r\n  1811 (?). _The Sagacious Buck, or Effects of Waterproof._\r\n\r\n  1811 (?). _Richmond Hill._ After H.

A dashing captain, dressed in his regimentals, as was\r\nthen the everyday fashion in the King's service, is placing a ring\r\non the finger of a comely maiden of tender years, who is smiling and\r\nblushing. The postilion who has driven the runaway pair to this stolen\r\nmatch is standing, cap in hand, grinning at the ceremonial.

In the foreground is shown the mishap of the\r\nballoon-hunters; a stout old gentleman is endeavouring to drag his\r\nvehicle up hill; his horse is shying and kicking; a dog is barking at\r\nthe animal's head, the shafts are snapped, and the trap is kicked over;\r\nthree fair riders are thrown out in picturesque confusion on the turf,\r\nand scattered with bottles and a bundle.\r\n\r\n_November 25, 1811._ _English Manner and French Prudence; or French\r\nDragoons brought to a check by a Belvoir Leap.

A tutor, or proctor, dodging round\r\n'the quad,' is horrified at the scandalous licence; a sturdy infant is\r\ncarried in one of the pails, the other is filled with cream, and offers\r\na rare opportunity for plunder, of which a passing dog is not slow to\r\navail himself--raised on his hind legs he is lapping up the welcome\r\nfluid at his leisure.\r\n\r\n1811. _Royal Academy, Somerset House, London._ Rowlandson fecit.--The\r\nmembers, who are studying from the nude, are all well advanced in\r\nyears.

It will be remembered that Sir William Chambers, the\r\narchitect, whose masterpiece was decidedly Somerset House, was a member\r\nof the Royal Academy, and held the office of Treasurer to that body.\r\nIt was somewhat the fashion of the wits to laugh at the architect,\r\nwho, as a foreigner, had received an amount of royal patronage which\r\ncreated certain jealousies in the minds of his English rivals, who\r\nwere less favoured with the smiles of princes. Chambers' extravagant\r\nconceptions, the various novel designs he published, and particularly\r\nhis marked taste for so-called Oriental gardening and the introduction\r\nof buildings after the Chinese fashion, exposed the project to an\r\nordeal of the severest criticism and sarcasm. George the Third employed\r\nSir William Chambers to lay out and adorn the Royal gardens at Kew,\r\nwhen the eminent Swede took advantage of the occasion to carry out the\r\ntaste he had acquired in China[24]--an indulgence which subjected the\r\narchitect to numerous well-merited satires. The famous 'Heroic Epistle\r\nto Sir William Chambers' was provoked on this occasion.\r\n\r\nPeter Pindar, according to his custom, found various faults with the\r\nnew pile of buildings in the Strand, and their shortcomings were\r\npointed out with his habitual archness.\r\n\r\nThe scene of disaster and tumultuous medley which Rowlandson has\r\nventured to introduce as attendant incidents of the Royal Academy\r\nstaircase must have assisted, in some degree, to make this portion of\r\nthe building a laughing-stock with the more frivolous portion of the\r\nfrequenters.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: EXHIBITION 'STARE' CASE.]\r\n\r\nThe Editor acknowledges the situation is treated with a licence\r\nwhich, perhaps, may be held to verge on the inadmissible. It has been\r\nsufficiently difficult, in selecting these illustrations, to keep\r\nwithin the restrictions marked out by modern decorum, too chaste\r\nto endorse the broad jocularity which passed current half a century\r\nback. The mirth imported into _Somerset House_ is not, however, of a\r\nlicentious description; if the subject is treated with more freedom\r\nthan is desirable, according to the juster ideas of our generation, at\r\nleast its humours are innoxious and, we trust, guiltless of offence.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE MANAGER'S LAST KICK.]\r\n\r\nIt is obvious that, in an instance like the present, the task becomes\r\none of extreme delicacy; it is impossible to translate the caprices\r\nof the artist by any method short of the etching-needle; the mixed\r\ndescription of the spectacle and the spirit of the _contretemps_ defy\r\na mere verbal rendering; and the caricature is too excellent in other\r\nrespects to be passed over in the present collection, which professes\r\nto give a general view of the artist's cleverest and most familiarly\r\nknown examples. While avoiding instances the morality of which is\r\nabsolutely questionable, it is evident that it would be impossible\r\nto treat of the actual history, let alone the novels and caricatures\r\nof our forefathers, or to venture on the merest enquiry into their\r\nfamiliar life, abroad or at home, unless we put prudery a little on one\r\nside.\r\n\r\n1811. _The Manager's Last Kick, or a New Way to Pay Old Debts._\r\nPublished by T. Tegg (117).--An episode in theatrical management is\r\nmade the subject of the present caricature. As is well known, pecuniary\r\ncomplications were occasionally attendant evils of carrying on\r\ntheatrical enterprises, especially some half a century ago. Sheridan's\r\nmonetary difficulties were notorious, and although the holders of\r\nwrits had recourse to expedients without end to serve the slippery\r\nmanager of Drury Lane, it is just to add that 'Sherry's' ingenuity was\r\nfrequently equal to the emergency. During a rehearsal at Drury Lane a\r\nSheriff's officer by some subterfuge gained admittance to the stage,\r\nand presented the manager with his objectionable scrip of parchment.\r\nSheridan was by no means disconcerted, but made the process-server at\r\nhome, asking his advice on various points; and finally, as the story\r\ngoes, having thrown the man off his guard, he induced him to mount to\r\nthe front of the house to give his opinion on the sounding properties\r\nof the building. 'Can you hear me?' asked Sheridan. 'Perfectly,'\r\nreplied the man. 'Then,' said Sheridan, 'you had better lose no time in\r\ncoming down again, and catch me if you can, for I'm off!' And before\r\nthe disconcerted bailiff could find his way back to the stage his\r\ncharge had succeeded in making good his retreat.\r\n\r\nIn _The Manager's Last Kick, or a New Way to Pay Old Debts_, the same\r\nprinciple is involved; in this case, however, just as the _red tail_\r\nwrit is being served on the manager, a stage trap-door is suddenly let\r\ndown, and the objectionable visitor is whisked off the scene. The wily\r\nlessee is bowing his fallen enemy out of sight with mock respect: 'Good\r\nmorning, Mr. Catchpole; you'll find more of your tribe when you get to\r\nthe bottom!'\r\n\r\n_No Date._ (1811?). _Preparing to Start._ Published by T.

'What\r\nsituation in my family would you wish to undertake, young woman?'\r\nenquires the lady of the house. 'Ma'am,' replies the unsophisticated\r\nmaiden, 'I should like to be under your man-cook by way of\r\nimprovement.' This _naïf_ remark is misconstrued, to the manifest\r\ndelight of the fat _chef_, who is rolling about and rubbing his round\r\nsides with amusement.\r\n\r\n1811 (?). _Anglers of 1611._ Designed by H.

Maudlin, her mother, a quaint old dame, is discoursing\r\nwisdom. Piscator is, with folded arms, leaning on his fishing-rod; at\r\nhis feet are two fine trout. Peter is whipping a stream in the rear.\r\nThe scenery is pretty, and the figures are neatly and expressively\r\nfilled in. The design, which is by Bunbury, it is easy to recognise has\r\ngained considerable force from the spirited execution his contemporary\r\nhas brought to bear on the etching.

The student has\r\nevidently been to a masquerade overnight; portions of the dress of a\r\nGrand Turk are scattered about; moreover a lady is in his chambers,\r\nwho is performing her toilette at a gilt mirror standing on his\r\nbreakfast-table. The Templar, semi-clad, is sleepily trying to look\r\nthrough a bundle of briefs and law papers.\r\n\r\n1811. _A Family Piece. (The Portrait Painter.)_ Designed by H. Bunbury,\r\nengraved by T. Rowlandson.\r\n\r\n1811. _A Barber's Shop._ H. Bunbury del., Rowlandson sculp.--Two\r\ncustomers, already polished off, are putting on their cravats at the\r\nglass, and a stout old gentleman is in a shaving-chair having his\r\nhair dressed. A brace of dogs are quarrelling over a wig, which they\r\nare worrying like a rat and pulling different ways. A client is being\r\nlathered and is under operation, while a gentleman, who has been\r\nshaved, is wiping off the remains of the soapsuds. This design, one of\r\nthe latest due to the hand of the gifted Henry Bunbury,[25] was also\r\nengraved on a larger scale by James Gillray: it was the last plate upon\r\nwhich he was able to work, and it proceeded but slowly, being touched\r\nin rare lucid intervals as his increasing madness permitted.\r\n\r\nThe etching, as executed by Gillray, bears the date 1811 in one corner,\r\nand to this is added the date of its deferred publication, May 15,\r\n1818. The title given on the folio engraving is _Interior of a Barber's\r\nShop in Assize Time_. The great caricaturist carried this plate, _the\r\nlast work on copper by the hand of Gillray_, as notified upon the\r\nprint, so far as his intermittent returns of reason would allow him.\r\nAs Gillray died June 1, 1815, when the plate was evidently unfinished,\r\nthis is probably one of the caricaturist's coppers which, as we have\r\nalready related, were handed to George Cruikshank, another departed\r\nworthy, to complete. The unexpected death of the veteran has prevented\r\nthe writer verifying this circumstance, although it is probably one of\r\nthe plates--probably the most important as to size--which Cruikshank\r\nheld in recollection when he informed the writer he considered that\r\nthe most flattering testimonial which had been paid him in his long\r\nlife was being selected, while a young man, to complete the engravings\r\nGillray had left unfinished under the painful circumstances of his\r\nmental aberration, as already detailed. (See _The Works of James\r\nGillray, the Caricaturist, with the Story of his Life and Times_, page\r\n19, Introduction; and, further, the reduced engraving, from this plate\r\n(1811), page 370, the _Works_).\r\n\r\n1811 (?). _Modern Antiques._--The cabinet of an antiquarian, richly\r\nfilled with supposititious relics of the past. On a shelf is a row\r\nof Etruscan vases; bacchic masks and terminal gods are ranged on the\r\nwalls; the chief features of the collection are a gathering of Egyptian\r\ndeities and some magnificent sarcophagi. The satire, in some degree,\r\nseems to hint at Sir William Hamilton (then deceased) and the fair Emma.\r\n\r\nAn old antiquary, decrepit and bent, is peering at the shapely\r\nproportions of an Egyptian figure bearing a close resemblance to life.\r\nThe chief incident of the picture is centred in a mummy's coffin,\r\ntenanted for the time, like a sentry-box, by a gallant young officer,\r\nwho is embraced, behind the lid of his temporary resting-place, by a\r\nlady, who, like all the beauties designed by the artist, is represented\r\nof fine proportions and somewhat free graces. The _inamorata_ has\r\nthrown down a work which she has evidently studied to some purpose,\r\n_Loves of the Gods--embellished with cuts_, and she is taking the\r\nopportunity to make a practical application of her readings.\r\n\r\n1811. _Munchausen at Walcheren._ Plates by Rowlandson.\r\n\r\n1811. _Chesterfield Burlesqued._ Published by T.

The\r\npoint of view is supposed to be taken from the junction of Petticoat\r\nLane with Smock Alley.

The novice is evidently well\r\nadvanced on the downward route, and has fallen among experienced\r\nprofessors of the plucking process. A gaily-dressed lady by his side,\r\na 'decoy duck,' of captivating exterior, is beguiling the senses of\r\nthe self-satisfied dupe with various familiarities; while a smug stout\r\nperson, dressed like a parson, is discreetly keeping up the spirit of\r\nthe affair by filling the glasses and manufacturing fresh supplies of\r\npunch, which the 'spooney' is imbibing freely and without regard to\r\nthe consequences. A pile of gold and notes has been laid on the table\r\nby this very innocent pigeon, and opposite to him sits the crafty and\r\naccomplished 'rook'--a captain, from his 'keeping'--who, by a skilful\r\nmanipulation of the cards, assisted by the carelessness of the simple\r\nyoung _roué_, bids fair to succeed in leaving the pigeon 'without a\r\nfeather to fly with;' the plunder to be apportioned amongst the hopeful\r\ntriumvirate in whose company the youth has the misfortune to find\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\n_March 1, 1812._ _Catching an Elephant._ Published by T.

Rowlandson, 1 James\r\nStreet, Adelphi.--Four learned Doctors, dressed in their clerical\r\nvestments, are keeping in their own fashion a day set apart by the\r\nChurch for general mortification. The portly four are seated at a\r\nwell-furnished board, and trains of servants are, with respectful\r\nattention, bringing in fresh supplies--poultry, dainty meats, and other\r\ndelicacies. The well-stocked collegiate cellars have been laid under\r\ncontribution; bottles of choice vintage are standing in wine-coolers\r\nand in promising rows on the floor, beside a liberal jorum of punch in\r\na _Bowl for a Bishop_. The nature of the private meditations of these\r\nepicurean worthies is thus made manifest, while the order of the repast\r\nis further set forth in a lengthy _bill of fare_ irreverently written\r\non a _New Form of Prayer for the Fast Day_, by way of _menu_. The\r\nwalls are suggestively hung with _Lists of the Great Tithes_ and such\r\ncongenial paintings as _A Bench of Bishops_, represented regaling at a\r\nroystering banquet, _Susannah and the Elders_, _Brasenose College_, &c.\r\n\r\n_March 25, 1812._ _Sea Stores._--A bevy of females consisting of a\r\nnegress and other beauties from the purlieus of the port, 'waiting for\r\nJack,' are sportively accosted by a dapper young midshipman who has\r\nbeen sent on shore to procure supplies for his ship, which is lying\r\noff.

Music, painting, sculpture,\r\nliterature, chemistry, and other arts and sciences seem to have\r\noccupied his attention by turns, and instruments suggestive of the\r\nrespective pursuits are muddled up with domestic details incidental to\r\nthe confinement of a wife and family to one solitary chamber, together\r\nwith the utensils of cookery, besides the food itself. The genius\r\nhas left his rest under the impulse of an inspiration; he has an old\r\nnightcap worn over his wig, and is still in his night-shirt, with\r\ndown-at-heel slipper on one foot, and a ragged stocking on the other.\r\nHe is seated, in an attitude expressive of sudden exaltation before\r\nan easel which bears the canvas he is filling out with rapid energy;\r\nhis left hand grasps a pen, and a black cat in demanding attention has\r\nfixed her claws in his unclad limbs; but the artist is so absorbed in\r\nhis subject as to be unconscious of pain; miscellaneous litter, a bust,\r\na palette, and a sheaf of brushes, paint-pots, a still and furnace,\r\nbooks, scales, syringes, a fiddle, and a post horn are scattered\r\nbehind the easel. The female companion of this genius is tranquilly\r\nsleeping in an easy attitude through all the confusion; on the table\r\nby the bedstead (on which her husband's garments are displayed) is\r\na coffee-pot and some suggestions of breakfast; an unclad infant is\r\nleaning over the table, and pouring gin into a wineglass. Another\r\nsemiclad child is seated on a tub before a blazing fire, amusing\r\nherself with the bellows, and is in danger from a steaming kettle and\r\na red-hot poker. Food, knives, forks, plates, and a pewter quart-pot\r\nare at the artist's feet; he has just kicked over a large porringer of\r\nmilk, and is heedless of the mischief. Lamps, caudle-boats, strings of\r\ncandles, and bunches of onions are the decorations of the chimneypiece;\r\nragged clothes and unmended stockings are hanging over a rope stretched\r\nacross the chamber; on the wall is hung a smart three-cornered hat and\r\na sword by the side of pictures of 'Aerostation' and the portraits of a\r\nballet-dancer and 'Peter Tester.'\r\n\r\nRowlandson has put his own name to the print as the 'inventor;' the\r\nsatire is very unsparing, and the squalor he has attributed to his\r\nprofessional brother is of the direst and most ludicrous description,\r\nbut the figure of the painter is marked with vigorous characteristics,\r\nand the outline of the face which he has bestowed on his erratic\r\ngenius, designedly or not, bears a suggestive resemblance to his own\r\nstrongly-defined features.\r\n\r\n_April 4, 1812._ _In the Dog Days._ Published by T.

The experienced mariner is declaring, 'Why, d'ye see, I am\r\nan old seaman, and not easily imposed upon. I say that can't be my\r\nson Jack's child. Why, he has not been married but three months, and\r\nduring that time he has been at sea--the thing is impossible!

Tegg (171).--Six subjects, illustrating the\r\nresults of the advance of genteel ideas and the introduction of a\r\nnew-fashioned system of refining on everything. A ragged match-seller\r\nis elevated into a 'timber merchant.' A postman becomes a 'man of\r\nletters.' A gardener is raised to a 'Master of the Mint.' A Jew hawker,\r\nwho cries, 'Any old clothes to shell?' is changed to a 'merchant\r\ntailor.' A sexton, pressing down the mould on a grave, is translated\r\ninto 'a banker;' and a poulterer easily becomes a 'Turkey merchant.'\r\n\r\n1812. _Bitter Fare, or Sweeps Regaling._--As in the preceding\r\ncaricature the date of this plate has been altered; it was probably\r\npublished in 1802, and re-issued later, a common occurrence with\r\nRowlandson's prints. _Bitter Fare, or Sweeps Regaling_, was, it seems\r\nlikely, designed as a companion to _Love and Dust_ (1792, &c.), and\r\nit partakes of the same ragged inspiration. In the hovel tenanted\r\nby the somewhat undesirable 'Chummey family' smoke is the prevalent\r\nelement; the sooty company, sufficiently black and begrimed in\r\ntheir own persons, seem perfectly in their element before a smoking\r\nfireplace--as they are reposing luxuriously on sacks of soot. The heads\r\nof the family are amiably sharing their enjoyments, drinking beer\r\nfrom a pewter measure, and smoking long clay pipes; the sweeper lads,\r\nbut for a coat of soot comparatively unclad, are revelling amidst the\r\ncinders on the hearth, divided between the congenial relaxations of\r\neating porridge and tormenting an unfortunate cat. Brushes, shovels,\r\nand the professional belongings of chimney-sweeping are scattered\r\nabout; the only article of fancy admitted into the establishment is a\r\nblackbird, which is possibly present on the ground that its hue offers\r\na resemblance to the general complexion.\r\n\r\n_October 12, 1812._ _Raising the Wind._ Published by T. Rowlandson, 1\r\nJames Street, Adelphi.\r\n\r\n    When noblemen have lost racehorse, and all their rhino spent,\r\n    Then little Isaac draws the bond and lends for cent. per cent.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: RAISING THE WIND.]\r\n\r\nRowlandson's print introduces the nobleman at the precise moment his\r\naffairs need 'patching up,' for 'mended' he never can be after he\r\nhas put himself into the spider-like clutches of plausible Isaac and\r\nhis 'friend in the City.' The 'little Jew broker' has brought a rich\r\nusurer of his tribe, and between them his lordship's career of folly\r\nwill be swiftly run. All the ready-money is gone, and the racing stud\r\nhas followed it; but the 'road to ruin' is only just opening up. The\r\nspendthrift is a comparative beginner; the next step is raising money\r\non his _title deeds_, which are undergoing inspection under the\r\nvulture-like eye of the scrivener, who, it appears, lends money on good\r\nsecurity and traffics in annuities and jointures.\r\n\r\nThe borrower is evidently accustomed to take life easily, he is putting\r\nhimself into the claws of the Israelites, and is otherwise 'going to\r\nthe bad' with perfect good humour and in a sociable frame of mind, not\r\nunlike the way of proceeding practised by the heroes of Sheridan's\r\ncomedies; indeed, there is a great deal of the _Charles Surface_\r\nelement in the composition.\r\n\r\nThe pictures which fill young Hopeful's walls tell his story after the\r\nHogarthian method. There are portraits of the relatives who have left\r\ntheir savings and estates to the present careless holder: Sir Matthew\r\nMite, a miser; Lady Crane; and Sir Peter Plumb--all persons of a 'warm'\r\ndisposition as to wealth. There is a 'view of the Yorkshire estate;'\r\nthen there is 'The Prodigal Son,' which may be held to apply to the\r\nheir, whose ways of making the money fly are further illustrated by\r\nsuch pictures as a 'Hazard Table,' 'A game fighting-cock,' a racehorse,\r\n'Sancho,' on the course; and a blood mare, 'Diana,' and foal; the\r\nbreeding and running of racehorses being considered then, as now, among\r\nthe most expeditious routes to insolvency.\r\n\r\n_November 30, 1812._ _Christmas Gambols._ Published by T. Rowlandson, 1\r\nJames Street, Adelphi.--The festivities represented, which partake of\r\nthe free and frolicsome description, are taking place in the servants'\r\nhall. Full drinking has been the order of the evening; the master's\r\ncellar and the servants' heads have both been lightened simultaneously,\r\nand the results are displaying themselves under the mistletoe and in\r\nhorseplay. A footman and a parlour-maid are rolling over one another\r\nindiscriminately on the hearthrug amidst the fragments of crockery\r\ndemolished in their downfall. A sturdy black footman is lifting a fat\r\nwench in his arms for a chaste salute. Practical joking is the order of\r\nthe evening; the fat cook has been toppled back in her armchair, and is\r\nvainly flourishing her basting-ladle to drive off her assailant, while\r\nher feet are in the air; and the butler, as author of the mischief,\r\nis making the best use of his opportunities, while another couple are\r\nexchanging kisses with evident goodwill.\r\n\r\n1812. _The Successful Fortune-hunter (Bath Crescent), or Captain\r\nShelalee leading Miss Marrowfat to the Temple of Hymen._--In the\r\ndistance are indicated the regular frequenters of Bath, sufferers from\r\ngout on crutches, and invalids in wheeled-chairs. A dashing Irish\r\nadventurer, one of the bold fortune-hunters--notorieties from the\r\nSister Isle in Rowlandson's day--is leading captive the wealth and\r\nperson of a somewhat vulgar and stumpy heiress, whose figure is loaded\r\nwith jewellery fashioned on a scale of oppressive magnitude.\r\n\r\n1812. _Hackney Assembly. 'The Graces, the Graces, remember the\r\nGraces!'_ From erasures in the date of this plate it seems probable\r\nthat it was originally issued ten years earlier. As the title\r\nindicates, this sketch is a broad burlesque of the deportment displayed\r\nby the frequenters of a suburban ball-room. The awkward and ungainly\r\ncarriage of all the figures is amusingly exaggerated. A master of\r\nthe ceremonies, the expression of whose features is complicated by\r\na decided squint, is briskly performing the rites of his office and\r\nintroducing a cobby little gentleman as a partner to an angular and\r\nmisshapen spinster, who, in consulting _the graces_, has thrown her\r\nGothic frame into an absurdly constrained and affected posture.\r\n\r\n1812. _The Learned Scotchman, or Magistrate's Mistake._ Woodward del.,\r\nRowlandson sculp. Published by T. Tegg (150).--A Scotchman is led\r\nbefore a country justice, charged with drunkenness; the magistrate's\r\nwife is seated by the side of her lord, and is much shocked at the\r\nlearned Caledonian's defence; bowing low, bonnet in hand, the Scot is\r\nthrowing himself on the clemency of the court: 'I own, your honour, I\r\nwas a little inebriated, but your worship knows _Nemo mortalium omnibus\r\nhooris saupit_.' 'What's that you say, fellow,' retorts the magistrate,\r\n'about a sawpit?--a very improper place to go with such company. I\r\nwonder you are not ashamed to mention such a thing, and before my wife\r\ntoo. But, however, as it is your first offence, I will discharge you\r\nthis time; but never come here with such a story again!'\r\n\r\n1812 (?). _Preaching to some Purpose._--An open-air meeting of rustic\r\nworshippers. Great astonishment is pictured on the upturned faces of\r\nthe expectant congregation. The preacher is raised on an extemporised\r\npulpit; he is clad in black, but in the rear of his nether garment\r\nappears a formidable rent, which his hand is not sufficiently broad\r\nto conceal. He is earnestly addressing his perplexed hearers to the\r\nfollowing purpose: 'Dearly beloved, before I begin my discourse, I\r\nhave three things to inform you of. The first thing I know, and you do\r\nnot know. The next thing you know, and I do not know,--and the third\r\nthing none of us know, viz., in my way here to preach, crossing Farmer\r\nHobson's stile, I tore my breeches,--the extent of the rent I know, and\r\nyou do not know. Secondly, what you are willing to subscribe to get\r\nthem repaired you know, and I do not know. And lastly, what Tim Snip,\r\nthe tailor, will charge for the job, _that none of us know_!'\r\n\r\n1812 (?). _New Invented Elastic Breeches._ H. Nixon invt., T.\r\nRowlandson sculp.--Two tailors are using considerable manual force\r\ntrying to pull a customer into a pair of close-spring breeches. The\r\nscene is taking place on the premises of the inventor and manufacturer\r\nof the patent articles in question.\r\n\r\n_No date._ 1812 (?). _A Visit to the Doctor._ Woodward del., Rowlandson\r\nfecit. Published by T. Tegg.--The consulting-room of a learned\r\nphysician; an imposing bookcase fills the background. The doctor's\r\nman has just shown up a comfortable-looking couple, who have called\r\nfor the benefit of the physician's advice--the practitioner is one of\r\nthe old school--full-bottomed wig, powder, and pigtail, a learnedly\r\nlong-skirted square-cut suit, lace frill and ruffles, huge spectacles,\r\nand a professional gold-headed cane held up to the nose; he is standing\r\non the hearthrug, warming his learned back at the fireplace; above the\r\nmantelpiece is a bust of Galen. The patients, who are evidently robust\r\ncountry folks, thus set forth their case:--'Do you see, Doctor, my dame\r\nand I be come to ax your advice--we both of us eat well, and drink\r\nwell, and sleep well,--yet still we be somehow queerish!' The Doctor is\r\nequal to the emergency and prepared to alter all this promptly. 'You\r\neat well, you drink well, and you sleep well,--very good. You were\r\nperfectly right in coming to me, for depend upon it I will give you\r\nsomething that shall do away with all these things!'\r\n\r\n1812 (?). _Puff Paste._--A fat cook is rolling out pudding paste;\r\naround her board are spread _codling tarts, apple dumplings, and batter\r\npuddings_; a footman is embracing her ample shoulders, and familiarly\r\npatting her under the chin.\r\n\r\n1812. _Mock Turtle_ pictures a pair of elderly suitors cooing over a\r\nbowl of mock turtle soup; a pair of real turtledoves, perched on a\r\nbranch, are introduced to carry out the allusion.\r\n\r\n1812. _Off She Goes._ Rowlandson fecit. Published by T. Tegg.--An\r\nelopement unexpectedly accelerated. A rope-ladder has enabled\r\na stout abductor to assist the flight of a somewhat mature and\r\nremarkably corpulent lady from the window of her chamber. A rung of\r\nthe rope-ladder has given way with the weight; at the moment a male\r\nrelation, nightcap on head, is discovering the flight and throwing a\r\nlight on the subject with a chamber candle which he is holding out of\r\nthe bedroom window. The partner of the elopement is an officer; he is\r\nprecipitated on to his back, and forms a convenient cushion to receive\r\nthe lady's fall, which is complete and overwhelming. A postchaise,\r\nprepared for the flight, is seen in the distance; the postilion is\r\nenjoying the spectacle of his employer's downfall; and the moon,\r\npeeping over a cloud, is represented with a broad grin on its face at\r\nthe expense of these disconcerted 'fly-by-nights.'\r\n\r\n1812. _English Exhibitions in Paris, or French People astonished at our\r\nimprovements in the Breed of Fat Cattle._\r\n\r\n1812. _A Cat in Pattens._ Rowlandson invt.--Though thoroughly in\r\nRowlandson's characteristic manner the scene is somewhat suggestive\r\nof Hogarth's plate of 'Morning,' 'Times of the Day,' in which the\r\nportrait of Miss Bridget Allworthy is exhibited, the introduction of\r\nwhose burlesqued resemblance is said to have cost the painter the\r\nloss of a legacy. An old maid whose countenance certainly bears a\r\nclose resemblance to that of a cat, is shuffling along in the breeze\r\non pattens; she has a boa and an enormous muff; before her trots a\r\nFrench poodle, clipped fantastically to resemble a parody of a lion;\r\nbehind her shivers a black page, in a tight gaudy uniform; under his\r\narm is his mistress's umbrella, and he holds before him a bundle of\r\ncat's meat. A half-naked and ruffianly beggar is trying to excite the\r\nbenevolence of this shrewish _Cat in Pattens_.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n                           PETTICOAT LOOSE.\r\n\r\n                  _A FRAGMENTARY TALE OF THE CASTLE._\r\n\r\n                WITH FOUR PLATES ETCHED BY ROWLANDSON.\r\n\r\n      London: J. J. Stockdale, 41 Pall Mall, Feb. 12, 1812. 4to.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe argument upon which the story is founded is set forth in the\r\nfollowing 'advertisement':--\r\n\r\n_'Dublin Castle. The Adventure of the Under Petticoat at the Castle\r\nDrawing Room. \"Honi soit qui mal y pense.\"_ All the world has been\r\namused with the singular disaster that befel a lady on Thursday night\r\nlast at the _Viceregal Palace_, by the loss of her under petticoat,\r\nwhich, from the pressure of the crowd, unfortunately slipped down\r\nthrough the capacious encumbrance of her hoop, and was soon trampled on\r\nthe floor--though likely to become as renowned as Penelope's web: for\r\nthe lady to whom it belonged lost by night the comfort and protection\r\nthat was her security by day. One of the young pages (who are always\r\npeeping and bustling on such occasions) first made the discovery. The\r\ntrophy was soon displayed in order to find out the fair owner; which,\r\nhowever, still remains a secret, except to the person immediately\r\nconcerned. But, like the shield of Achilles, the little petticoat soon\r\nbecame the subject of admiration and contention.\r\n\r\n'At the first impression the master of the ceremonies claimed the\r\nprize, as his official perquisite, alleging it was dropped in the\r\n_Presence Chamber_. But the Chamberlain insisted the drawing-room was\r\nhis _champ d'or_, and every windfall on such occasions his exclusive\r\nproperty. That as a true knight he must take up the gauntlet thus\r\nthrown down by a lady.\r\n\r\n'The household troops, particularly the young _aides-de-camp_,\r\nstruggled through the crowd to see the cause of such bustle; and having\r\nsatisfied their curiosity, whispered one another, and, in their usual\r\nway, set up a great titter. The chaplain in waiting had his eye upon\r\nthe petticoat, and said he thought in decorum it ought to be deposited\r\namong the _new antiquities_ in Bedford Chapel.\r\n\r\n'The Duke, with his usual good humour, liberality, and regard for\r\nthe fair creation, decided the contest by saying that it should be\r\nsuspended as a banner round the temple of love and beauty; and that as\r\nEdward the Third constituted the Order of the Garter from a similar\r\naccident at the British Court, he would solicit the Prince Regent, in\r\nthe true spirit of chivalry, to establish and become _Sovereign of the\r\nOrder of the Petticoat_ in Ireland, in commemoration of the pleasant\r\nadventure,' &c.\r\n\r\nPlate 1. _Capture of the Petticoat._ February 12, 1812.\r\n\r\nPlate 2. _Breakfast Room at an Inn._ February 12, 1812.\r\n\r\nPlate 3. _College Green before the Union._ February 12, 1812.--A scene\r\nof state, bustle, and prosperity.\r\n\r\nPlate 4. _College Green after the Union._ February 12,\r\n1812.--Shabbiness, poverty, and beggary have sole possession of the\r\nscene.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nVIEWS IN CORNWALL.\r\n\r\n_April 10, 1812._ _View of a Farm House at Hengar, Cornwall._ Published\r\nby T.

Five editions were issued between 1812 and\r\n1813.\r\n\r\nThe work was described as _The Tour of Doctor Syntax in Search of the\r\nPicturesque_. A Poem. With new plates.\r\n\r\nThe old subjects, it appears, were re-engraved by Rowlandson's hand,\r\nwith but slight variations from the originals. The outlines are\r\nsomewhat less bold, and three new subjects are added; one being the\r\nfrontispiece, which represents the worthy Doctor at his desk, seated\r\nin his armchair, in deep cogitation, touching his forehead as the idea\r\nof his famous _Picturesque Tour_ suggests itself to his brain. The\r\nwindow of his study is opened, that he may contemplate the exterior\r\nprospect at his ease, while a sketch, by his own hand, in India-ink,\r\nis displayed before him. Various papers and books are scattered about,\r\nwith sundry objects which indicate his versatile accomplishments--a\r\nfiddle hung on the wall, books of travel, sheets of the Doctor's\r\noriginal treatise--_Every Man his own Farrier_--with a goodly jar of\r\n_cherry bounce_ to rejoice the learned man's spirits.\r\n\r\nOn the titlepage is engraved a quaint vignette of architectural relics,\r\nruins, a castle, &c., the detached monuments being disposed so as to\r\nform the word _Picturesque_.\r\n\r\nThe third addition is plate 27, in the body of the Tour, introducing\r\n_The Doctor's Dream_ (in his patron's library) _of the Battle of the\r\nBooks_, which was not included in the work on its original publication.\r\n\r\nThis edition is preceded by an Introduction, which in some degree\r\nexplains the relative positions--as far as the preparation of the\r\nwork was concerned--of the artist and William Combe, the author, who\r\nthus sets the matter before his public: 'The following poem, if it\r\nmay be allowed to deserve the name, was written under circumstances\r\nwhose peculiarity may be thought to justify a communication of them. I\r\nundertook to give metrical illustrations of the prints with which Mr.\r\nAckermann decorated the _Poetical Magazine_, a work published by him\r\nin monthly numbers, for the reception of original compositions. Many\r\nof these engravings were miscellaneous, and those (which were, indeed,\r\nthe far greater part of them) whose description was submitted to such\r\na muse as mine represented views of interesting objects and beautiful\r\nscenery, or were occasional decorations appropriate to the work. Those\r\ndesigns, to which this volume is so greatly indebted, I was informed,\r\nwould follow in a _series_, and it was proposed to me to shape out a\r\nstory from them. An etching, or a drawing, was accordingly sent to me\r\nevery month, and I composed a certain proportion of verse, in which,\r\nof course, the subject of the design was included; the rest depended\r\non what my imagination could furnish. When the first print was sent\r\nto me I did not know what would be the subject of the second; and in\r\nthis manner, in a great measure, the artist continued designing, and I\r\ncontinued writing, every month for two years, till a work containing\r\nnear ten thousand lines was produced; the artist and the writer having\r\nno personal communication with or knowledge of each other....\r\n\r\n'Mr. Ackermann has his reasons for risking a republication of it in\r\nits present form; and I now feel more than common solicitude that it\r\nshould answer his expectations.... _The Battle of the Books_ was an\r\nafter-thought, and forms the novelty of this volume.\r\n\r\n                          Liberius si\r\n    Dixero quid, si forte jocosius; hoc mihi juris,\r\n    Cum veniâ dabis.--HOR. _S._ lib. i. v. 103.\r\n\r\n'I have only to add, that though, on a first view of some of the\r\nprints, it may appear as if the clerical character were treated with\r\nlevity, I am confident in announcing a very opposite impression from a\r\nperusal of the work.'\r\n\r\nThe origin of _Doctor Syntax_ is ascribed, with characteristic\r\npartiality, to John Bannister, the comedian, by his biographer, John\r\nAdolphus.\r\n\r\n'Of another graphic series, which owed its existence almost entirely\r\nto the invention of Bannister, I have the following account:--Dining\r\nat a tavern, with him and a third person, Rowlandson was asked, \"What\r\nare you about, Rolly?\" \"Why, nothing in particular,\" he said. \"I think\r\nmy inventive faculty has been very sluggish of late; I wish one of you\r\nwould give me a hint.\" Being asked of what kind, he answered, \"I feel\r\nin a humour to sketch a series where the object may be made ridiculous\r\nwithout much thinking. I have been making a tour in Cornwall and\r\nDevonshire with a friend, who, as I have made sketches on the coast\r\nfor him, wishes me to introduce adventures at inns, and other comic\r\nincidents, in which he was the principal party. But what can I do for\r\nsuch a hero?--a walking turtle--a gentleman weighing four-and-twenty\r\nstone--for such scenes he is quite out of the question. I want one of a\r\ntotally different description.\" And he named a celebrated tourist, who\r\nby a recent publication had given much celebrity to the Lakes.\r\n\r\n'\"I have it!\" said Bannister. \"You must fancy a skin-and-bone hero, a\r\npedantic old prig, in a shovel-hat, with a pony, sketching-stools, and\r\nrattletraps, and place him in such scrapes as travellers frequently\r\nmeet with--hedge alehouses, second and third rate inns, thieves,\r\ngibbets, mad bulls, and the like. Come!\" he proceeded, warming with\r\nthe subject, \"give us a sheet of paper, and we'll strike out a few\r\nhints.\" The paper was produced, Bannister gave his ideas, Rowlandson\r\nadopted them, Combe explained them in a well-written poem; and to\r\nthis conversation and to the lively invention of Bannister the public\r\nis indebted for a highly favoured publication, _The Tour of Doctor\r\nSyntax_.'\r\n\r\nIt is by no means improbable that Bannister's suggestion had something\r\nto do with the eccentric personality of the hero of the _Picturesque\r\nTours_; but the author of the _Memoir of John Bannister_ assumes too\r\nmuch when he records that the ideas for the adventures of Doctor Syntax\r\nwere struck out at a sitting and in the easy fashion he has described;\r\nit is known that the original designs were furnished at the rate of\r\nthree a month, and that their invention was spread over the entire\r\nperiod of the publication.\r\n\r\nThe popularity enjoyed by this Tour was manifested in the number\r\nof editions sold; it was further pirated and imitated in various\r\nforms. A German edition was published in Berlin in 1822; the poem\r\nwas translated under the title of _Die Reise des Doktor Syntax um\r\ndas Malerische aufzusuchen. Ein Gedicht frei aus dem Englischen ins\r\nDeutsche übertragen. Lithogr. v. F. E. Rademacher._ The illustrations\r\nwere copied in outline on stone, either with a fine point or a pen; the\r\nlines are wire-like and give neither fullness nor effect; the pictures\r\nare also coloured in a feeble and powerless style, and the whole is a\r\nvery poor rendering, as far as the artist's work is concerned.\r\n\r\nA French edition, freely translated by M. Gandais, appeared in Paris,\r\nwith twenty-six engravings--rendered with considerable ability by\r\nMalapeau (lith. de G. Engelmann)--drawn on stone with care and spirit\r\nin lithographic chalk; these illustrations, printed in a warm tint, and\r\ncoloured by hand, will compare fairly with even Rowlandson's original\r\netchings. We give the title of this edition:--_Le Don Quichotte\r\nRomantique, ou Voyage du Docteur Syntaxe à la recherche du Pittoresque\r\net du Romantique; Poême en XX chants, traduit librement de l'Anglais\r\npar M. Gandais, et orné de 26 gravures par Malapeau. À Paris chez\r\nl'auteur, rue du Faubourg Saint Denis 45, et Pélicier libraire, cour du\r\nPalais Royal._ 1821. The author's advertisement, as written by Combe,\r\nis carefully and literally rendered, and the translator has added a\r\nslight _avertissement_ of his own, briefly alluding to the reputation\r\nenjoyed in England by the original engravings and the descriptive\r\nverses which accompany them, and setting forth the circumstances of his\r\nown version, &c.\r\n\r\nNumerous imitations, less legitimate than the foreign translations\r\nalluded to, also appeared in this country, such as _The Tour of Doctor\r\nSyntax through London_; _Doctor Syntax in Paris, in Search of the\r\nGrotesque_; _Doctor Prosody_; _Sentimental Tour through Margate and\r\nHastings by Doctor Comparative, Junr._; and _Doctor Syntax's Life of\r\nNapoleon_, which is possibly due to Combe's pen, and derives a strong\r\nadditional interest from the illustrations, which are fair examples\r\nof George Cruikshank's handiwork. A parody, in verse, entitled _The\r\nAdventures of Doctor Comicus, by a modern Syntax_, was also issued,\r\nwith coloured imitations of Rowlandson's designs.\r\n\r\nThe success which had attended the first _Tour of Doctor Syntax_\r\nwas so flattering and remunerative that the publisher and his able\r\ncollaborateurs, the artist and author, projected a second series,\r\nentitled _Doctor Syntax in Search of Consolation_--for the loss of that\r\ntermagant spouse who figures in the original _Tour_, and is decently\r\nburied, in the first cantos of the new adventures, to give the hero a\r\nfitting cause for pursuing his eccentric travels. The renewal of Dr.\r\nSyntax's journeys, which appeared in monthly parts, was completed in\r\n1820, when it was republished by Mr. Ackermann, uniform with the first\r\nvolume; it was less successful than its predecessor, but it ran through\r\nseveral editions.\r\n\r\nThe plates, which were contributed by Rowlandson, much on his old\r\nprinciple, were as follows:--\r\n\r\n    Frontispiece.--Doctor Syntax and his Counterpart.\r\n    Doctor Syntax lamenting the loss of his Wife.\r\n      \"       \"   at the Funeral of his Wife.\r\n      \"       \"   setting out on his Second Tour.\r\n      \"       \"   and the Gypsies.\r\n      \"       \"   loses his Wig.\r\n    The visit of Doctor Syntax to Widow Hopeful, at York.\r\n    Doctor Syntax amused with Pat in the Pond.\r\n      \"       \"   in the Glass House.\r\n      \"       \"   visits Eaton Hall, Cheshire.\r\n      \"       \"   making his Will.\r\n      \"       \"   in a Court of Justice.\r\n      \"       \"   present at a Coffee-house Quarrel at Bath.\r\n      \"       \"   and the superannuated Fox-hunter.\r\n      \"       \"   with the Skimmington Riders.\r\n      \"       \"   and the Bees.\r\n      \"       \"   visits a Boarding School for Young Ladies.\r\n      \"       \"   making a Discovery.\r\n      \"       \"   Painting a Portrait.\r\n      \"       \"   Marriage of Doctor Dicky Bend.\r\n      \"       \"   at an Auction.\r\n      \"       \"   and the Bookseller.\r\n      \"       \"   at Freemasons' Hall.\r\n    Miss Worthy's Marriage--Doctor Syntax in the chair.\r\n\r\nA third and final Tour, ending with the hero's funeral, concludes the\r\npoem. The last volume, which had appeared, like its predecessors,\r\nin monthly parts, was put forth in its collected form in 1821; and,\r\nsimilar to the first and second series, with which it was afterwards\r\nre-issued, it received sufficient patronage to carry it through several\r\neditions, although neither the Second nor Third Tours were reckoned so\r\nsuccessful as the original series.\r\n\r\nThe _Third Tour of Doctor Syntax--in Search of a Wife_ appeared with\r\nthe following 'Preface,' from the pen of the veteran Combe, who, for\r\nhis private reasons, preferred to continue anonymous throughout.\r\n\r\n'This prolonged work is, at length, brought to a close. It has grown to\r\nthis size under rare and continuing marks of public favour; while the\r\nsame mode of composition has been employed in the last as in the former\r\nvolumes. They are all equally indebted to Mr. Rowlandson's talents.\r\n\r\n'It may, perhaps, be considered as presumptuous in me, and at my age,\r\nto sport even with my own dowdy Muse, but, from the extensive patronage\r\nwhich Doctor Syntax has received, it may be presumed that, more or\r\nless, he has continued to amuse: And I, surely, have no reason to be\r\ndissatisfied, when Time points at my eightieth year, that I can still\r\nafford some pleasure to those who are disposed to be pleased.\r\n\r\n                                                          'THE AUTHOR.'\r\n\r\nThe illustrations to the third volume, which are quite equal both in\r\nspirit, invention, and execution to those designs which suggested the\r\nframework of the first and second Tours, are as follows:--\r\n\r\n    Frontispiece.--Doctor Syntax setting out in search of a Wife.\r\n    Vignette, on Titlepage.--Doctor Syntax assisting at an Instrumental\r\n      Trio.\r\n    Doctor Syntax Soliloquising.\r\n      \"       \"   turned Nurse.\r\n    The Banns forbidden.\r\n    Doctor Syntax with a Blue Stocking Beauty.\r\n    The Cellar Quartetto.\r\n    Doctor Syntax Presenting a Floral Offering.\r\n    The Billiard Table.\r\n    Misfortune at Tulip Hall.\r\n    The Harvest Home.\r\n    The Garden Trio.\r\n    Doctor Syntax at a Card Party.\r\n      \"      \"    Star-gazing.\r\n      \"      \"    in the wrong Lodging-House.\r\n      \"      \"    received by the Maid instead of the Mistress.\r\n    The Artist's Room.\r\n    Death of Punch.\r\n    The Advertisement for a Wife.\r\n    Doctor Syntax and the Foundling.\r\n    The result of Purchasing a Blind Horse.\r\n    A Noble Hunting Party.\r\n    Introduction to Courtship.\r\n    Doctor Syntax in Danger.\r\n    The Funeral of Doctor Syntax.\r\n\r\nThe popularity which attended the three Tours in the form of their\r\noriginal publication induced Mr. Ackermann to issue a fresh edition\r\nin 1823. The three volumes were printed in 16mo, instead of royal\r\n8vo, and the plates were re-engraved, one-third of the original size.\r\nThis pocket edition, containing all the illustrations, in a reduced\r\nform, was published at the moderate price, considering the plates were\r\ncoloured by hand, of seven shillings a volume; the former series having\r\nbeen produced at one guinea per volume.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1813.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BACHELOR'S FARE--BREAD AND CHEESE AND KISSES.]\r\n\r\n_February 10, 1813._ _Bachelor's Fare--Bread and Cheese and Kisses._\r\nPublished by T.

It is also instructive\r\nto observe that the former is now placed in a situation in which\r\nall Europe _may see through him_. The emblem, too, of the circle of\r\ndazzling light from mere _vapour_, which is so _soon extinguished_, has\r\na good moral effect; and as the gas represents the dying flame, so does\r\nthe drum, on which he is seated, typify the hollow and noisy nature of\r\nthe falling usurper.'\r\n\r\nThe above description of the subject appeared in the _Sun_ of Saturday,\r\nNovember 6, 1813. These printed comments arose from the picture itself\r\nhaving been transparent, and from a circle which surmounted the same,\r\nindicative of the strength and brotherly union of the Allies, composed\r\nof gas of brilliant brightness. (See January 1, 1814.)\r\n\r\n_November 22, 1813._ _The Norwich Bull Feast, or Glory and Gluttony._\r\nPublished by T. Tegg (232).--The success gained by the allied armies\r\nover Napoleon and his forces, and the series of French disasters\r\nwhich had culminated at Leipzig, gave rise to rejoicings all over the\r\ncountry, in celebration of the supposed final downfall of the Corsican\r\nEmperor, the traditional enemy of England, as the people had been\r\ntaught to consider him. Norwich, according to the print, is the scene\r\nof disorderly revelry. A huge bullock has been roasted whole in the\r\nmarket-place, and the carcase is being cut up and distributed in the\r\nstreets; the unruly mob fighting over the morsels and wrenching the\r\nbones from those who are ravenously picking them; scuffles, struggles,\r\nscrimmages, and savage onslaughts are the order of the day. At the\r\nsame time a puncheon of beer or spirits is broached for gratuitous\r\ndistribution, and a pretty spectacle of misrule is the consequence.\r\nThe fair sex are represented as the chief competitors for the drink;\r\npails, cans, and jugs are eagerly filled, and as greedily emptied;\r\nthe contents being poured down the throats of the holders or down\r\nthose of their friends, who are opening their mouths to receive the\r\nliquor, which is gushing forth in streams. The incidents surrounding\r\nthe liquor-cart are, if possible, more disreputable and degrading than\r\nthose transpiring on all sides of the trestles on which the ox is being\r\ndismembered by a pair of butcher's men, armed with a chopper and a\r\nhuge carver. Some of the female patriots are reduced to insensibility,\r\nand efforts are being made to revive one poor creature, who is lying\r\nunconscious in the midst of the struggling mass, either overpowered\r\nby the potency of the drink or smothered by the pressure; buckets\r\nof the fluid are being emptied over the prostrate sufferer by tipsy\r\nSamaritans, without alleviating her condition.\r\n\r\nThe town of Norwich is given up to the gala; flags are flying,\r\nand illuminations and fireworks render the sight more animated. A\r\ntumultuous procession is struggling along, bearing guns, pikes, &c.,\r\nand carrying the effigy of Buonaparte to be gibbeted or burnt at a\r\nbonfire. Flags head the mob, inscribed _Downfall of the Tyrant_; _Peace\r\nand Plenty_, &c.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A LONG PULL, A STRONG PULL, AND A PULL ALL TOGETHER.]\r\n\r\n_November 25, 1813._ _A Long Pull, a Strong Pull, and a Pull All\r\ntogether._ Published by T. Tegg (233).--The end of 1813 promised to\r\nwitness the downfall of the great 'little Boney;' one misfortune\r\nfollowed another; ally after ally abandoned the conqueror, who in the\r\nhour of victory had behaved magnanimously to the subjugated States,\r\nand they in return deserted their new friend when disasters were\r\npressing on him--a sure proof of the danger of confiding in alliances\r\nextracted at the point of the sword or made in bad faith on grounds\r\nof desperate expediency. As we have seen, the blow came from the\r\nNorth: the treachery of Bernadotte, King of Sweden, a man who owed\r\nhis elevation to the Emperor, pointed the way to prostrate Europe to\r\nfree herself from the ambitious thraldom of Napoleon; the Russian Bear\r\nbroke his false slumbers, the Austrian and Prussian Eagles escaped\r\nfrom their chains, Spain was cleared of the invaders, and lastly the\r\nKingdom of Holland revolted in the rear of the disabled Corsican. The\r\nking, Napoleon's brother, Louis, whom he had imposed on this kingdom,\r\nhad voluntarily abdicated the crown in favour of his son, a minor, in\r\n1810. The subject is treated allegorically by Rowlandson. _The Sun of\r\nTyranny_ is setting on the deep; the fleets of the allies are riding on\r\nthe seas, which are once more free, and the Dutch are helping to push\r\noff the Texel fleet to join the common cause. As the Allies marched\r\nagainst France after Napoleon's defeat at Leipzig, a combined force\r\nwas sent against Holland, which had been incorporated with the French\r\nEmpire in 1810, and placed under the constitution of Jan. 1, 1811, the\r\nseventeen provinces of the Netherlands being united under the dominion\r\nof France. The Prussian and Russian forces, under General Bülow, were\r\njoined by a detachment from England under General Graham; the old\r\nOrange party once more came into activity, and on November 30, 1813,\r\nthe hereditary Stadtholder arrived at the Hague. The caricaturist has\r\nsimplified his view of the situation by ignoring the change of affairs\r\nthat had intervened since 1810, when the Duke of Piacenza became the\r\nEmperor's representative in Amsterdam until 1811, when the State was\r\nmerged into the French Empire. The artist has assumed that the kingdom\r\nhad remained as administered at the resignation of Louis, July 1, 1810;\r\nand accordingly the abdicated monarch, without his crown, is pictured\r\ndancing about in a distracted state on the soil of Holland, deploring:\r\n'Oh! Brother Nap, Brother Nap, we shan't be left with half a crown\r\na-piece!' Napoleon is represented, according to the usual fashion of\r\nthe satirists, flying about in an ungovernable frenzy as he views the\r\nreceding fleet and recognises the revolt of the Netherlanders: 'Oh!\r\nBrother Joe, I'm all fire; my passion eats me up! Such unlooked-for\r\nstorms of ills fall on me! It beats down all my cunning; I cannot\r\nbear it! My ears are filled with noise, my eyes grow dim, and feeble\r\nshakings seize every limb!'\r\n\r\nThe _Long Pull, Strong Pull, and a Pull all together_ is taking place\r\non the mainland. The weight and persevering force of John Bull is\r\ntelling on the towing-line; the Don Spaniard is hand-over-hand with the\r\nnational prototype, a condition of things marvellously altered since\r\nthe days of the caricature. A Russian, in furs, is the next in energy;\r\nan Austrian huzzar has the rope well over his shoulder; a Prussian and\r\nothers are throwing their exertions into the haul; and all is moving as\r\nmerrily as could be desired.\r\n\r\n_November 27, 1813._ _The Corsican Toad under a Harrow._ Published by\r\nR. Ackermann, 101 Strand.--The Corsican, who is represented as both\r\nprematurely aged and haggard, is sprawled, spread-eaglewise, on the\r\nground; upon him is a formidable harrow, which is kept in its place by\r\nthe obese figure of a traditional Hollander, who is leisurely smoking,\r\nwith his hands in his pockets and an Orange favour in his hat, in\r\nphilosophic indifference to the situation and sufferings of the victim,\r\nwho is exclaiming, 'Oh! this heavy Dutchman! Oh! had I not enough to\r\nbear before!!!'\r\n\r\nA Cossack is goading on the prostrate leader of the French with his\r\nlance; and a bird of prey is swooping down, attracted by the smell of\r\ncarrion. The harrow is in vigorous hands, representatives of Austria,\r\nPrussia, and other German Powers; Spaniards, Portuguese, and a British\r\ntar are tugging away with hearty good-will.\r\n\r\n_November 27, 1813._ _The Execution of two celebrated Enemies of Old\r\nEngland, and their Dying Speeches, November 5th, 1813._ Published by\r\nR. Ackermann, 101 Strand.--The effigy of Guy Faux, with his lantern,\r\nis suspended by a rope round his neck to a gallows, and facing him, on\r\nanother gallows, is the figure of the Emperor Napoleon, in his uniform\r\nas general of the French army. A bonfire is blazing up bravely, and a\r\nparty of schoolboys and villagers are the delighted spectators. A note\r\ninforms us that the scene is not an imaginary one, but is a faithful\r\nrepresentation of a 'bonfire at Thorpe Hall, near Louth, Lincolnshire,\r\non 5th November, 1813, given by the Rev. W. C---- to the boys belonging\r\nto the seminary at Louth, in consequence of the arrival of news of the\r\ndecisive defeat of Napoleon Buonaparte by the Allies, at 11 o'clock\r\nP.M. on the 4th, and Louth bells ringing all night.'\r\n\r\n    _Guy Faux's Dying Speech._\r\n\r\n    I, Guy Faux, meditating\r\n    my country's ruin by the\r\n    clandestine and diabolical\r\n    means of Gunpowder Plot, was\r\n    most fortunately discovered\r\n    and brought to condign\r\n    punishment by Old England,\r\n    and here I bewail my fate.\r\n\r\n    _Napoleon Buonaparte's Dying Speech._\r\n\r\n    I, Napoleon Buonaparte, flattered by all the French\r\n    nation that I was invincible, have most cruelly and most\r\n    childishly attempted the subjugation of the world. I have\r\n    lost my fleets, I have lost the largest and finest armies ever\r\n    heard of, and I am now become the indignation of the\r\n    world and the scorn and sport of boys. Had I not spurned\r\n    the firm wisdom of the Right Hon. William Pitt, I might\r\n    have secured an honourable peace, I might have governed\r\n    the greatest nation; but, alas! my ambition has deceived\r\n    me, and Pitt's plans have ruined me.\r\n\r\n_November 29, 1813._ _Dutch Nightmare, or the Fraternal Hug Returned\r\nwith a Dutch Squeeze._ Published by R. Ackermann.--The great Emperor is\r\nstretched, sleepless, on his imperial state bed, with the diadem above\r\nand a row of captive crowns embroidered round the canopy, the fasces\r\nof Roman lictors at the feet, and the furniture powdered with golden\r\neagles and fleur-de-lis. This luxurious couch is not to be coveted,\r\nsince tranquil rest is out of the question. The Emperor is writhing\r\nin agony, saddled with a nightmare which is not to be dislodged.\r\nThe Hollanders at this time contrived to shake themselves free from\r\ntheir fraternal friends the French, who had laid their country under\r\ncontributions until the disciples of freedom prayed to be delivered\r\nfrom their tutors. The example of Holland and the victories ending\r\nwith the triumph at Leipzig gained by the Allies, and especially the\r\nsuccesses secured under Wellington, re-encouraged the subjugated and\r\nprostrate Powers to look forward to the recovery of their freedom,\r\nand to take their revenge on the little conqueror. A stout Dutchman,\r\ndressed in his national costume, and wearing the Orange cockade, is,\r\naccording to the picture, returning the lesson in fraternity which had\r\ncost him dear at the hands of the French, by showing his instructor the\r\nvigour of a hearty Dutch squeeze. This heavy incubus, with his hands\r\nin his pockets, is smoking his pipe, and puffing the distasteful fumes\r\nfull into the face of the powerless and disgusted Corsican, and crying,\r\n'Orange Boven!'\r\n\r\n_November 30, 1813._ _Plump to the Devil we boldly Kicked both Nap and\r\nhis Partner Joe._ Published by T. Tegg (234).--The heavy Hollander,\r\nstill sporting his Orange colours, is finally roused to dispose of the\r\nintruders by the most summary and quickest method possible; with his\r\npipe in one hand and a squab bottle of Schiedam, or Dutch courage, held\r\nlike a mallet in the other, Mynheer is giving Nap a taste of Dutch\r\nweight; one vigorous kick has propelled the little Corsican high into\r\nthe air and plump into the arms of the Father of Evil, who is emerging\r\nfrom his 'Brimstone Lake' to make sure of his friend. In the distance\r\nanother Dutchman, provided with a pitchfork, is prodding Napoleon's\r\nbrother Louis--who had been created King of Holland--towards the same\r\nrefuge for the destitute; the usurper's crown being left behind in the\r\nflight.\r\n\r\n_December 4, 1813._ _The Corsican Munchausen--humming the Lads\r\nof Paris._ Published by R. Ackermann, 101 Strand.--The Emperor,\r\nwith all the bombast, bravado, and speciousness of which he had an\r\nexcellent command, has summoned a meeting of his faithful subjects and\r\nsupporters--who, judging from the expression of their faces, appear\r\nbut an unwilling and disaffected audience--in order to present his\r\ninfant son to the people. The scion of the great captain is dressed\r\nin a miniature uniform, with a long sabre trailing on the ground,\r\nand a gold stick, which he is trying to fancy is a riding-horse. The\r\nImperial throne, the back of which bears a Medusa's head and a globe of\r\nthe world, is capsized by Munchausen's manoeuvrings. The Corsican is\r\nvapouring on a grand scale, trying ineffectually to raise the ardour of\r\nhis dupes: 'Did I not swear I would destroy Austria? Did I not swear\r\nI would destroy Prussia? Did I not leave the Russians 1,200 pieces of\r\ncannon to build a monument of the victory of Moscow? Did I not lead\r\n498,000 men to gather fresh laurels in Russia? Did I not burn Moscow,\r\nand leave 400,000 brave soldiers to perish in the snow, for the good\r\nof the French nation? Did I not swear I would destroy Sweden? Did I\r\nnot swear I would have colonies and commerce? Did I not build more\r\nships than you could find sailors for? Did I not burn all the British\r\nproduce, bought and paid for by my faithful merchants, before their\r\nfaces, for the good of them and of my good people of Paris? Have I not\r\ncalled my troops from Holland, that they might not winter in that foggy\r\nclimate? Have I not called my troops from Spain and Portugal, to the\r\nruin of the English? Did I not change my religion and turn Turk, for\r\nthe good of the French nation? Have I not blown up the corporal for\r\nblowing up the bridge? Have I not robbed the churches of twenty flags\r\nto send to my Empress, for the loss of my own flags and eagles? And\r\nnow, for the good of my Empire, behold, O ye Lads of Paris! I have put\r\nthe King of Rome in breeches!!!'\r\n\r\n_December 6, 1813._ _Funking the Corsican._ Published by R.\r\nAckermann.--The situation of the Emperor, as pictured by Rowlandson, is\r\nbecoming critical; he is elevated on a cask of 'real Hollands Geneva,'\r\non the top of which he is dancing about in exasperation, unable to\r\nassist himself, and surrounded by his enemies, who are all putting the\r\ngreat conqueror to his wits' end and revenging themselves by smoking\r\nout the Corsican; each of the representatives of the rebellious States\r\nand Powers being armed with a pipe, and pouring volumes of the fumes\r\nround the person of the tortured general; Spain, Portugal, Hanover; the\r\nCossack, the Pole, Austria, Sweden, Bavaria, and Prussia, seated on a\r\ncannon, are all assisting; the King of Würtemburg is provided with a\r\nflask of 'Würtemburg drops;' John Bull has his foaming jug of 'brown\r\nstout;' while the Dutch Mynheer, seated on a cask of Dutch herrings,\r\nwith his tobacco-pouch and twists of pigtail, is drawing a flagon of\r\nGeneva to drink success to his Serene Highness, sending out a volume\r\nof tobacco-fumes, which are completing the irritation of the badgered\r\nCorsican, who is kicking off the head of the Hollands cask, into which\r\nhe will evidently plump head over ears--\r\n\r\n           The fly that sips treacle is lost in the sweets.\r\n\r\nBefore disappearing condign vengeance is threatened on the heads of his\r\nenemies: 'Oh! you base traitors and deserters! Eleven hundred thousand\r\nLads of Paris shall roast every one of you alive, as soon as they can\r\ncatch you!'\r\n\r\n_December 10, 1813._ _The Mock Phoenix!!! or a vain attempt to rise\r\nagain._ Published by R.

Flames are issuing from the\r\nfurnace, and, in spite of the exertions of the stokers, the figure of\r\nthe Emperor is seen dwarfed, but still intact, in the thick of the\r\nfire, but whether he will rise seems doubtful; his diadem is in full\r\nblaze, while the orb and sceptre are snatched away by certain diabolic\r\nclaws, and the phoenix process threatens to prove a signal failure.\r\nSerpents are crawling out of the mouth of the furnace; showers of\r\nsnakes, dragons, devils, and all kinds of monsters, kin of the phoenix,\r\nare hovering amidst the smoke, and making hostile demonstrations\r\nagainst the declining conqueror.\r\n\r\n_December 12, 1813._ _Friends and Foes--up he Goes--Sending the\r\nCorsican Munchausen to St. Cloud._ Published by R. Ackermann.--The\r\nEmperor is left, unsupported, in the hands of his enemies, now turned\r\ninto tormentors: he is thrown into a blanket and tossed up into the\r\nair, and is suffering worse discomforts than did Sancho Panza under\r\na similar infliction; crown, sceptre, and sword are shaken off. '_O\r\nmisericorde!_' cries the flying Munchausen as he is sent up to the\r\nclouds. John Bull (whose wig and hat have been thrown aside), the\r\nDutch Mynheer, and Spanish Don are performing wonders with their side\r\nof the blanket; then come the Cossack, the Pope, the Pole, the Prince\r\nImperial of Austria, the Emperors of Russia and Austria, and the Kings\r\nof Prussia, Hanover, and Würtemburg, who are all lending a hand to\r\ntorment the Corsican.\r\n\r\n_December 14, 1813._ _Political Chemists and German Retorts, or\r\nDissolving the Rhenish Confederacy._ Published by R. Ackermann.--A\r\ndelicate operation, which has engaged the attention of all the leading\r\nPowers of Europe, is supposed to be proceeding. The colossal power\r\nof the Corsican is undergoing transmutation, and the conqueror is\r\ngradually being resolved into his original elements. A _German Stove_\r\nsupplies the furnace, and the fuel is recruited from John Bull's _Coal\r\nTub_; that patriotic person is assisting the process as one of the\r\nleading experimental chemists; _Dutch bellows_ are furnishing various\r\npowerful blasts; the _Spanish Don_ is pounding some effectually\r\nirresistible chemicals in his famous mortar, _Saragossa_. The Corsican\r\nhas been forced into a receiver; Bernadotte is pouring in a portion of\r\n_sulphate of Swedish iron_ before the cover is fixed on; the Emperor,\r\nwho has been reduced to mere pigmy proportions, is praying for time:\r\n'Oh, spare me till the King of Rome is ripe for mischief yet to come!'\r\nIn various retorts are seen the several elements which entered into\r\nthe Imperial analysis, now resolved apart--_Intrigue and Villany_,\r\n_Ambition and Folly_, _Gasconade and Lies_, _Arrogance and Atrocity_,\r\n_Fire and Sword_, _Murder and Plunder_. All the leading States of\r\nEurope are engaged in the operation; the King of Würtemburg is giving\r\nhis instructions; Prussia, Austria, Hesse, &c., are all interested\r\nin the success of the operation. The Pope has contributed two potent\r\nagents, _Fulminating powder_, and _Drops from the vial of wrath_.\r\nRussia, Poland, the Emperor of Austria, &c., are seated, as chemists,\r\nat a table dividing out the agents selected to dissolve the structure\r\nraised by Napoleon. From certain tracts at the Cossack's feet we learn\r\nthat the 'liberty of Germany' and the 'downfall of Boney' are settled\r\nprojects; while the name of Napoleon, as protector of the Rhenish\r\nconfederacy, is crossed out, and that of 'Francis, Emperor of Austria,\r\nrestored 1813,' is substituted in its old ascendency.\r\n\r\n_Napoléon le Grand. Inventée par Dubois; Alex. Tardieu effigiem del.\r\nDeposée à la Bibliothèque Impériale._--A parody of the French plate of\r\nNapoleon's apotheosis--\r\n\r\n    Astre brillant, immense, il éclaire, il féconde,\r\n    Et seul fait, à son gré, tous les destins du monde.-VIGÉE.\r\n\r\nThe head of Napoleon appears as the centre of the constellation, _Polar\r\nStar_, elevated, in this case, like that of a traitor, on a pole, and\r\nsurrounded by entwined and hissing serpents. Above is the face of\r\nSatan, wearing a crown of _Damnation_, supported by two escutcheons,\r\nmarked _Heart of Tyrant_, and _Vulture_, with scourges and pronged\r\nforks. The pole is elevated on the great globe; in either corner\r\nis a French eagle; above the Imperial ensigns are pikes, axes, and\r\nstandards, 'flags manufactured for the Empress,' &c.\r\n\r\nThe lustre of the constellation, Napoleon, is likely to suffer an\r\neclipse from the sudden descent of a Dutch comet--a philosophic\r\nHollander, seated astride on a barrel of Hollands Schiedam, the\r\ncontents of which he is ignominiously discharging over the head of\r\nthe solitary star of the firmament. The golden rays with which the\r\n_astre brillant_ is illuminating the universe owe their source to the\r\nfollowing luminous achievements:--\r\n\r\n    Assisting in the assassination of Louis the Sixteenth, my\r\n      Benefactor.\r\n    Murdering the citizens of Paris under Robespierre.\r\n    Murdering the citizens of Toulon.\r\n    Insulting the Pope, robbing and plundering the churches, &c., &c.\r\n    Poisoning my own sick soldiers at the hospital at Jaffa.\r\n    Murdering the Duke d'Angouléme.\r\n    Treacherously betraying the King of Spain and his family.\r\n    Murdering the inhabitants of Madrid in cold blood.\r\n    Murdering Captain Wright in the Temple, at Paris.\r\n    Marrying two wives and intriguing with the daughter of one of them.\r\n    The murder of Palm, of Hofer, &c., &c.\r\n    Leading 500,000 Frenchmen to perish in Russia by the severity of\r\n      the season 1812.\r\n    Losing another similar army the following year in Germany, 1813.\r\n    Writing lying bulletins.\r\n    Losing all the colonies, commerce, and shipping.\r\n    And for all these brilliant exploits I am now to be sent headlong to\r\n      the Devil.\r\n\r\n_December 25, 1813._ _Mock Auction, or Boney Selling Stolen Goods._\r\nPublished by R. Ackermann, 101 Strand.--Napoleon is pictured, before\r\nhis reverses became of a decided character, contemplating realising\r\nthe conquests he had in hand, with a possible view of retiring from\r\nthe trade. The Emperor has a sale-pulpit, and is himself officiating\r\nas auctioneer; the lot which is being offered is the crown of Spain;\r\nan old general is holding up the diadem, and the auctioneer, impatient\r\nat the indifference of the purchasers, is crying, 'What! no bidding\r\nfor the crown of Spain? Then take the other crowns and lump them\r\ninto one lot'--referring to a pile of diadems, the crowns of Russia,\r\nAustria, Prussia, the Papal tiara, &c., thrown into a corner, with\r\nbundles of standards, 'lots of useless eagles,' &c. Lot 2, 'Twenty\r\nflags, the property of the Empress,' 'Kingdom of Prussia,' 'Kingdom of\r\nWestphalia,' 'Saxony,' 'United Provinces,' &c. The Empress is standing\r\nbehind her husband, with the infant prince in her arms. Napoleon's\r\nheir is dressed in a uniform like his father's; his face is that of a\r\nmonkey. 'I suppose daddy will put us up for sale?' he is represented as\r\nsaying to the Empress.\r\n\r\nThe Mock Auction has drawn plenty of company together. The Dutchman\r\nis smoking his pipe with his accustomed philosophy; a British tar is\r\npatting him on the back, as his very cordial ally, and ridiculing\r\nthe Corsican's failure. The King of Würtemburg, Russia pictured as a\r\nCossack, Austria as a huzzar, Prussia, Bavaria, and other Powers are\r\npresent. The Spanish Don is making light of Buonaparte's pretence of\r\noffering his crown for sale; 'That a crown!' he is shouting. 'It's not\r\nworth half a crown!'\r\n\r\n_December 30, 1813._ _How to Vault in the Saddle, or a new-invented\r\nPatent Crane for the Accommodation of Rheumatic Rectors._ Rowlandson\r\ndelin. and publisher.--The incident depicted is taking place at the\r\ndoor of the rectory, beside the church porch, where a crane has been\r\nerected for the accommodation of the gouty and unwieldy divine. Two\r\nfrisky and solidly-built damsels are hauling away at a rope, to\r\nwhich a sling is attached. The corpulent rector is swinging in mid\r\nair, preparatory to being lowered into the saddle; in his pocket is\r\nshown a discourse on the apposite text--'_He that humbleth himself\r\nshall be exalted_.' A grinning groom is holding the head of a\r\nhigh-cruppered horse; the minister's steed is a curiously constructed\r\ninstance of equine anatomy, fondly reviving the image of the faithful\r\n_Grizzle_, rendered memorable as the _Rosinante_ of Doctor Syntax,\r\nthe long-enduring companion of his famous _Tour in Search of the\r\nPicturesque_.\r\n\r\n1813 (?). _Witches in a Hayloft._ Woodward delin., Rowlandson\r\nsculp.

The\r\nhumility of the sectarian has proved too deep for the inquisitors,\r\nwhose exactions he is evading. The chairman is indignantly remarking,\r\n'What an impertinent fellow to keep on his hat before such a dignified\r\nassembly!' Cries one of the examiners, 'None of your _thees_ and\r\n_thous_ here, sir--come to the point--we know you have evaded certain\r\nduties.' 'Pray, sir, do you know what we sit here for?' pertinently\r\ndemands another commissioner; to which the Quaker, with clasped hands,\r\nand rocking himself, like _Mawworm_, on his toes, responds, 'Verily I\r\ndo--some sit here for five hundred, others for a thousand; and moreover\r\nI have heard it reported that some sit here for two thousand pounds per\r\nannum!'\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DR.

An undertaker, in\r\nprofessional weeds, is coming in at the door, with his crape-bound\r\nmute's wand in his hand, and a coffin strapped on his shoulder. The\r\nghostly personification of Death, as a skeleton, holding up his\r\nhour-glass, is pointing his dart through the latticed window. Below the\r\nchair of the smug slumbering practitioner appears a paper bearing the\r\nwell-known lines:--\r\n\r\n    I purge, I bleeds, I sweats 'em;\r\n    Then, if they die, I lets 'em!\r\n\r\n1813. _The Cobbler's Cure for a Scolding Wife._ Published by T.

Ackermann.--In two compartments: _Napoleon\r\nbefore his Slaves_, and _Napoleon before his Conquerors_. The first\r\nview represents the Senate; the Emperor is standing on his throne,\r\nwhich is propped upon the crowns of conquered kingdoms; his dark\r\nfriend, the Devil, is leaning over the back of the Imperial chair and\r\nprompting the specious harangue which Napoleon is addressing to the\r\nsenators, who do not seem to be much interested in the proclamation,\r\nand, on the whole, according to the artist's showing, look very like\r\na body of imbeciles. _Extracts from Buonaparte's Speech. Sunday,\r\nDecember 19, 1813._--'Senators, Councillors of State, Deputies from the\r\nDepartments to the Legislative Body,--Splendid victories have raised\r\nthe glory of the French arms during this campaign. In these weighty\r\ncircumstances it was my first thought to call you all around me. I have\r\nnever been seduced by prosperity; I have conceived and executed great\r\ndesigns for the prosperity and the happiness of the world. As a monarch\r\nand a father, I feel that peace adds to the security of thrones and\r\nthat of families. I have accepted proposals and the preliminaries. It\r\nis necessary to recruit my armies by numerous levies, and an increase\r\nof taxes becomes indispensable. I am satisfied with the sentiments of\r\nmy people of Italy, Denmark, Naples, America, and the nineteen Swiss\r\nCantons, and have acknowledged the laws which England has in vain\r\nsought, during four centuries, to impose on France. I have ordered\r\ndischarges of artillery on my coming and leaving you.'\r\n\r\nThe other side of the picture displays the fallen Emperor under an\r\nentirely opposite aspect; this time he has to confront his enemies,\r\nand a totally changed demeanour is adopted. The Corsican is on his\r\nknees; before him is his sword, a pile of standards, and the diadems\r\nhe had abstracted from numerous crowned heads; the crown of France he\r\nhas tucked under his arm; all the rest he is offering to restore to\r\nhis enemies, the rightful owners, who have mustered in force and are\r\ncompletely masters of the situation. The attitudes of the Allies are\r\nexpressive of their indignation at 'Boney's' shameful avowals; while\r\nTalleyrand, on his lame leg, in the greatest trepidation at the dangers\r\nwhich face him, is offering to swear to the truth of the damaging\r\nadmissions which his master has found it expedient to make, since\r\nfalsehood will not serve him in this quarter.\r\n\r\n'Gentlemen, Emperors, Rhenish Confederations, &c., &c., &c.,--Behold\r\nbefore you a fallen impostor, who has for many years been drunk and\r\nintoxicated with ambition, arrogance, and insolence; who has deceived,\r\ncheated, and tricked you on many occasions; who has foolishly and\r\nwickedly lost, within a twelvemonth, a million of brave but deluded\r\nFrenchmen; who has conceived the great and diabolical design of\r\nenslaving the world, and has lost all his friends except Yankee\r\nMaddison. Now, gentlemen, to make amends for my sins, I solicit your\r\npardon and ask for peace on your own terms, gentlemen, and I will\r\nstrictly adhere to it till.... You may take all those crowns back\r\nagain, except the one belonging to the Bourbons. My Empress sends you\r\nalso back the twenty flags I found in some of the churches, in the\r\ncourse of my flight from Leipzig. As for the story, gentlemen, of the\r\ncorporal and the blowing up of the bridge, you must know 'twas mere\r\nhumbug to gull the lads of Paris.'\r\n\r\n_January 1, 1814._ _Death and Buonaparte._ Published at Ackermann's\r\nRepository.--The Corsican, who had faced and conquered Fate on so\r\nmany fields of battle, is at length confronted with the grim foe\r\nunder circumstances which lend additional terrors to his proximity.\r\nThe reverses which overtook the conqueror at Leipzig are already\r\nthreatening the downfall of that intrepid will and shaking a\r\nself-possession hitherto imperturbable.\r\n\r\nRowlandson has taken advantage of the thickening disasters, which\r\nhad then commenced to check the prowess of the Emperor's armies, to\r\nrepresent the Corsican in a fit of despondency, forlorn and abstracted,\r\nseated on a drum in an attitude of dejection, with his head between\r\nhis hands, staring in the face of the King of Terrors, of whose close\r\ncompany he is seemingly too self-occupied to take much heed. The grim\r\ndestroyer, as the skeleton Death, is watching the baffled general\r\nface to face, assuming a parody of his attitude, and seated on a gun,\r\nwith a broken eagle standard at his bony feet. The Russian, Austrian,\r\nPrussian, Bavarian, and other allied armies are streaming along in\r\nunbroken hosts, scattering the dismayed legions of France, and making\r\nhavoc amidst the ranks of the discouraged Grand Army, which is melting\r\naway before the combined forces.\r\n\r\n_The transparency exhibited at Ackermann's Repository_ (See Nov. 5,\r\n1813) _on the occasion of the illuminations for the victory of Leipzig_.\r\n\r\n_January, 1814._ _Madame Véry, Restaurateur, Palais Royal, Paris._ T.\r\nN. del., Rowlandson sculp.

The room presents an overwhelming glare of\r\ndecoration. The priestess, or rather the divinity, of this luxurious\r\ntemple is unrivalled among these places of public entertainment for the\r\ncharms of her person, the splendour of her dress, and the elegance of\r\nher manners. The elevated seat which she occupies was once the throne\r\nof the Viceroy of Italy, and was purchased by the proprietor of the\r\ncoffee-house for the exorbitant sum of twelve thousand livres.'\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LA BELLE LIMONADIÈRE.]\r\n\r\n_January 30, 1814._ _Quarter Day, or Clearing the Premises,\r\nwithout consulting your Landlord._ Published by T.

Ackermann, Strand.--The Emperor Napoleon, dressed in the simple\r\nand familiar habit by which his figure is best recognised, the little\r\ncocked hat, the green coat, buttoned across the chest, the white\r\nwaistcoat and breeches, is tearing his hardest towards 'Maynz' and\r\nthe Rhine; a frightened hare, suggestive of the Imperial courage,\r\nis scampering before him and marking the way. The 'little Corporal'\r\ncarries, instead of a walking-stick, the effigy of the great Emperor\r\nof Germany, _Carolus Magnus_, at the head of a pole. On his back is a\r\npack, from which the various collections he had previously gathered are\r\nsuffered to escape: Italy, Holland, Switzerland, Rheinland, Hanstat\r\nDépartement, Poland; paper prints of soldiers, _Alte Garde_ and _Junge\r\nGarde_--are blowing away and being left behind in the flight.\r\n\r\n_March 12, 1814._ _The Devil's Darling._ Published by R.\r\nAckermann.--The Dark Fiend in person, drawn on a tremendous scale, with\r\nhis claws, horns, hoofs, tail, and terror-striking accessories, is\r\nseated on his sulphurous floor, cradling and dandling his pet progeny,\r\n'_Little Boney_;' the figure of the Corsican is wrapped up like a\r\nmummy in swaddling-clothes, bound round with tricolor ribands; the\r\nface is alone exposed; and his Infernal Majesty is contemplating the\r\ncalm, thoughtful, wax mask-like countenance of his reputed vicegerent\r\non earth with earnest attention; his own features are wearing an\r\nexpression which is at least threatening; the Legion of Honour,\r\ninstituted by the Emperor, is held out by the apocryphal fiend as a\r\nbauble to tempt the spoiled child in his lap.\r\n\r\n_April 9, 1814._ _Blucher the Brave extracting the Groan of Abdication\r\nfrom the Corsican Bloodhound._ Published by T. Tegg (322).--The\r\nCorsican has been run down; the sturdy figure of the indomitable\r\nGeneral Blucher is shown acting as his executioner. Having come up\r\nwith the enemy and beaten him, the general is shaking the bloodhound\r\nout of his trappings; sword, diadem, and habit are cast aside, and the\r\ncreature is swinging in the Prussian's iron grasp, a mere frightened\r\ncur, with nothing of the dreaded 'Boney' left but his head. A boat\r\nis on the shore, and the fugitive, _Brother Joe_, the rejected\r\n'intrusive King' of Spain, in mortal terror is running his hardest to\r\nembark for the Island of Elba; the boatman is loading in the future\r\nprovision, £20,000 a year, the income decreed the Corsican for his new\r\nstate. Besides the deportation of the Buonapartes another scene is\r\ntranspiring: Louis the Eighteenth, a portly and good-natured-looking\r\nsovereign, is received with acclamations from all sides, while his\r\nfriends the Allies discreetly remain in the rear; the white flag of\r\nthe Bourbons, with its _fleur de lis_, is waving over the restored\r\ndescendant of St. Louis; the monarch's legitimate crown is restored,\r\nand the figure of Peace personified is adding a laurel wreath;\r\nChurchmen and some of 'Nap's' old servants are offering their homage,\r\nand the wily Talleyrand has apparently 'ratted' judiciously at the\r\ncritical moment, as the change of masters has not displaced the\r\nveteran diplomatist, and he is waiting on the King with a new 'list of\r\nministers for your Majesty's approval.'\r\n\r\n_April 12, 1814._ _Coming in at the Death of the Corsican Fox. Scene\r\nthe Last._ Published by R. Ackermann.--Neither the subject nor\r\nits title are altogether original, as, some six years previously,\r\nRowlandson's contemporary, James Gillray, had chosen to illustrate\r\nthe reverses which had attended the French arms in Spain by a similar\r\ncartoon, in which George the Third appeared as the huntsman, holding\r\nout the carcass of the Corsican fox. Both conceptions, in these\r\ninstances, as subsequent events proved, were somewhat premature as far\r\nas the conclusiveness of the performance was concerned.\r\n\r\nPrince Blucher, the valiant old trooper, has taken the lead of the\r\nfield; he has dismounted from his horse, whose bridle he is holding\r\nin his left hand, while his right is locked round the throat of the\r\nFox, who is struggling and clawing vainly to get free; 'Boney's' face\r\nis turning the pallid hue of deadly fear in sight of the eager pack\r\nof hounds, which are showing their teeth and leaping forward to rend\r\nthe vermin to fragments; the dogs are of good strain; on their collars\r\nmay be read the names of those generals who finally outwitted the\r\nCorsican--Wellington, Swartzenberg, Kutusoff, Platoff, Crown Prince,\r\nYork, &c., &c. The allied Emperors and Kings are riding down to be 'in\r\nat the death,' and in the distance are seen burning towns, which have\r\nbeen recently devastated by the ravages of the Corsican in his career\r\nof ambition.\r\n\r\n_April 12, 1814._ _Bloody Boney, the Carcass Butcher, left off Trade\r\nand Retiring to Scarecrow Island._ Published by T. Tegg (323).--The\r\nexiled general is reduced from his state; he is meanly travelling\r\nElbawards, and has reached the seashore, whence he is to embark for\r\nhis island residence. A gibbet by the way, with a rope in readiness,\r\nis serving as a fingerpost to point the road; vultures, which fly\r\nround this suggestive object, express a desire to pick the bones\r\nof the retiring 'carcass butcher.' All the splendours of 'Boney's'\r\nsurroundings are stripped bare; he is riding on a rough-coated donkey,\r\nand wearing a 'fool's cap' in place of a crown; his only provision is\r\na bag of brown bread; his consort, loose and ragged, is seated at the\r\ncrupper on the same beast, which is being unmercifully flogged with\r\na stick labelled '_Bâton Marcéchal_;' 'Boney' is lost in terror; his\r\njuvenile heir, lately made King of Rome, is preceding the _cortége_,\r\nmounted on a 'Corsican dog.'\r\n\r\nA French postilion, of the old school, is jumping about for joy, in\r\nhis huge bucket-like jack-boots, flourishing his whip, and rejoicing\r\nto see the backs of the usurping Corsican and his party: 'Be gar, you\r\n_coquin_, now I shall drive my old friends and _bonnes_ customers _de_\r\nEnglish. _Vive le Roi et la Poste Royale!_'\r\n\r\n_April 15, 1814._ _The Rogue's March._ Published by T.

A scorpion, 'Execration,' is\r\nfastening on to 'Boney's' person; and another reptile, 'Detestation,'\r\nis spitting venom at his less conspicuous relative. The exiled\r\nconvicts are being conducted past a file of Prussian Guards, and the\r\ndrums are beating the 'Rogue's March.' Their leader, Blucher, bears\r\na long quarter-master's staff, with a proclamation setting forth:\r\n'Napoleon, late Emperor of the French, King of Italy, Protector of the\r\nConfederation of the Rhine; Grand Arbiter of the Fate of Nations, &c.,\r\n&c., &c., but now, by the permission of the Allied Sovereigns, exile in\r\nthe Isle of Elba, an outcast from society, a fugitive, a vagabond. Yet\r\nthis is the conceited mortal who said, \"I have never been seduced by\r\nprosperity; adversity will not be able to overcome me!\"'\r\n\r\nA contrast to the crestfallen Bonapartes is offered in the restored\r\nBourbons. A flagpole is set up, and the old royal standards are\r\nunfurled: 'Rejoice, O ye Kings! _Vive le Roi!_' The sovereigns of\r\nEurope once more enjoy the opportunity of wearing their crowns in\r\npeace; and the allied monarchs are shown, in their royal robes, with\r\nall their splendours restored, dancing hand-in-hand in a ring round\r\ntheir combined escutcheons: 'Now we are met, a jolly set, in spite of\r\nwind or weather!'\r\n\r\n_April 17, 1814._ _The Affectionate Farewell, or Kick for Kick._\r\nPublished by R. Ackermann.--Buonaparte is being driven from France;\r\nit is clear that his presence there, after the settlement of his\r\nabdication, was a source of embarrassment while waiting for an\r\nopportunity to sail for his new island kingdom. The late Imperial\r\nChancellor is the most eager to be rid of his disgraced master; the\r\n'minister of expediency' is menacing the flying enemy; in one hand he\r\nholds the deed of expatriation, 'Abdication, or the last dying speech\r\nof a murderer--who is to be delivered into the hands of the Devil\r\nthe first fair wind.' 'Tally' is attacking his ancient confederate\r\n'Boney' with his club-foot and his crutch simultaneously: '_Va t'en\r\ncoquin._ I'll crack your crown, you pitiful vagabond;' to which the\r\nflying exile, with his hat held in hand as a mark of respect to his new\r\nmaster, is responding with humility: '_Votre très humble serviteur,\r\nMonsieur Tally_.' A gibbet, with its noose ready, is pointing to the\r\n'Isle of Elba.' Seen in the distance is the 'Boney' family, there\r\nreceiving the elevation which they have merited, all the members being\r\ncollectively exalted on a gallows. The victims of 'Boney's' successive\r\ncampaigns and actions without cessation, invalids whose limbs have been\r\nlost in his wars, are rushing up as fast as their maimed condition\r\nwill permit, flourishing their crutches and unstrapping their wooden\r\nlegs, as offensive weapons wherewith to avenge their injuries, crying:\r\n'Bone him, my tight little Tally;' while an invalid with one arm is\r\nwaiting for the flying general at the place of embarkation: 'What! let\r\nhim sneak off without a mark or a scratch? No, no, I'll darken his\r\ndaylights for him!'\r\n\r\n_April 20, 1814._ _A Delicate Finish to a French Usurper._ Published by\r\nJ.

The crown and sceptre of tyranny and all the 'Corsican's'\r\nconquests, Portugal, Vienna, Poland, Milan, Spain, Rome, Moscow,\r\nHolland, Switzerland, Vienna, Saxony, Florence, Dantzig, &c., have\r\nbeen disgorged. The figure of Father Time has winged his way to reckon\r\nwith the usurper; his hourglass is held aloft, and with a golden\r\nextinguisher Time is about to snuff Boney out. Wellington, the Emperor\r\nAlexander of Russia, the Emperor of Austria, and the Crown Prince are\r\nin attendance to see the last of their troublesome enemy. France is\r\nonce more freed, joyful and smiling; the labours of agriculture are\r\nresumed, and three symbolical nymphs are executing a joyful dance\r\nappropriate for the occasion, and supporting the arms of the restored\r\nBourbons.\r\n\r\n_April 25, 1814._ _Nap Dreading his doleful Doom, or his grand entry\r\ninto the Isle of Elba._ Published by T. Tegg (328).--The general\r\nhas arrived in his island kingdom, according to the satirist; the\r\nship which conveyed the abdicated monarch is riding in the bay;\r\nBoney's luggage has just been set on the shore by a smaller craft; a\r\nsingle guard, one of the Mamelukes, is sitting disconsolately by the\r\ndiminished effects of his master. The somewhat squalid inhabitants,\r\nNap's future subjects, are crowding down the rocks with vulgar\r\ncuriosity, pressing onwards through a narrow pass leading to the\r\nshore; they seem inclined to ridicule the deserted state of their\r\ndistinguished guest, who is plunged into dejection at his prospects.\r\n\r\n    Woe is me, seeing what I have seen,\r\n    And seeing what I see!\r\n\r\nA coarse stout female is patting the exile familiarly on the back and\r\noffering him her pipe by way of hospitality: 'Come, cheer up, my little\r\nNicky; I'll be your Empress!'\r\n\r\n_May 1, 1814._ _The Tyrant of the Continent is Fallen; Europe is\r\nFree; England Rejoices._ Published by R. Ackermann, 101 Strand.--The\r\n'Corsican' is exposed to a worse fate than fell to Belshazzar; his\r\nconquests are taken from him, the throne of state is overset, the\r\nImperial purple is stripped from his shoulders, the diadem and sceptre\r\nhave fallen; the sovereignties, crowns, and dignities which were his\r\nplaythings are swept away; the once almost master of the world is now\r\nin a desperate strait; his person is seized by the Father of Evil,\r\nwho is claiming his due; the presence of the Foul Fiend has disturbed\r\nNapoleon less than the hand of Fate: 'Empire and victory be all\r\nforsaken to plagues, poverty, disgrace, and shame. Strip me of all my\r\ndignities and crowns. Take oh take your sceptres back. Spare me but\r\nlife!' An arm of vengeance, appearing from the clouds, has effectually\r\nparalysed the faculties of the conscience-smitten conqueror; a flaming\r\nsword is hanging over his devoted head, and a voice of terror is\r\nproclaiming retribution:--\r\n\r\n    Thou'rt doom'd to pains at which the damn'd will tremble,\r\n    And take their own for joys.\r\n\r\n_May 1, 1814._ _Boney turned Moralist._ Published by R.

This view is, like most of the deductions of\r\nsatirists, rather beyond the strict veracity of the case. Bonaparte\r\nshowed himself during his stay in Elba, as it will be remembered, both\r\nactive and cheerful-minded; and it is recorded that he would discuss\r\nwith the visitors--who flocked to his miniature kingdom from motives\r\nof curiosity--his present condition and his past state with pleasant\r\nhumour and even jocularity.\r\n\r\n3. _What I ought to be--hung for a fool._--The figure of Napoleon, with\r\nan ass's ears added, is suspended on a gallows.\r\n\r\n_May 1, 1814._ _Irish Jaunting Car._--Hull, Esq., del. Etched by T.\r\nRowlandson. Published by T. Rowlandson, 1 James Street, Adelphi.\r\n\r\n_May 8, 1814._ _Peace and Plenty._ Published by T. Tegg (324).--The\r\nartist's view of the situation, with the smiling prospect of peace\r\nas set forth in 1814, was somewhat premature, as the more desperate\r\nevents of the year following amply confirmed; but, with a general\r\nconcord prevailing amongst the Allies, with the restless 'disturber of\r\nthe peace of Europe' safely dismissed to the Island of Elba, there\r\nto amuse his giant ambition by administering affairs in his miniature\r\nkingdom, the old monarchy being comfortably restored to France for an\r\ninterval, it was generally concluded that the world would once more be\r\nsuffered to move along pacifically, and that a new era of plenty and\r\ncommercial prosperity was reopening.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PEACE AND PLENTY.]\r\n\r\n_Peace and Plenty_ are represented much as such things look on the\r\neve of a congress of military powers, _Peace_ meaning the forces held\r\nin readiness, and _Plenty_, in this case, referring principally to\r\nthe war-chest, a plentiful supply of artillery, powder, shell and\r\nshot, and other offensive materials. The scene is fixed on one of the\r\nfortifications which had been set up to protect the security of our\r\ncoasts; the cliffs of 'old England' bristle with Martello towers and\r\nisland defences. A drummer is sleeping tranquilly, with his arm and\r\nhead resting on his instrument, and a pile of cannon balls by his side;\r\nthere are great guns of brass and iron, with a mortar and shells, ready\r\nfor use, while sentries are on the look-out, and the soldiers are fully\r\nequipped. The British standard is flying, and an air of gallantry is\r\nintroduced by the presence of certain buxom females, who are exciting\r\nthe admiration of the soldiers of the garrison gathered around the\r\nDulcineas and ogling and flirting with the skittish fair, whose ample\r\nproportions are such as to win the hearts and turn the heads of these\r\n'sons of Mars,' released for a while from 'war's alarms,' of which the\r\nwarriors were becoming reasonably tired after so many years of hard and\r\ncomparatively profitless campaigning.\r\n\r\n_May 15, 1814._ _Macassar Oil: an oily puff for soft heads._--It is\r\nrather a question whether subjects similar to the present, in which\r\nsome popular nostrum was held up to ridicule, were wholly playful or in\r\npart executed to order--a skilful method of indirect puffing much and\r\ningeniously practised in the magazines and other channels of the day.\r\nThe wondrous fluid Macassar is seen in application. A stout old party\r\nhas laid off his fool's cap and is seated in an armchair, undergoing\r\na trial of the efficacy of the oil: the perfectly bald head of the\r\nsubject is a good field for its employment, and the operator--who, by\r\nsome inconsistency characteristic of vendors of hair restoratives, is\r\nquite bereft of hair himself--is sleepily pouring oil from a flask\r\nover the broad surface beneath him. A lady has apparently been making\r\na trial of the process, and on consulting the looking-glass she seems\r\namazed to find a bushy head of hair pushing itself straight upwards\r\nwith amazing vigour. Round the apartment are files of bottles, 'wig\r\noil, one guinea per bottle,' and notices, 'Wonderful discovery: carroty\r\nor grey whiskers changed to black, brown, or blue, &c.'\r\n\r\n_June 14, 1814._ _Miseries of London, or a Surly Hackney Coachman._\r\n\r\n_June 20, 1814._ _Rural Sports, or a Pleasant Way of Making Hay._\r\nPublished by T.

Nothing could be more animated than the picture, which has an\r\nair of truth, nor could the scene be represented with fuller character,\r\nall its grotesque features being brought forward with ready fun. The\r\nlanding-place is bustling with business; small craft of all sorts are\r\npulling off to the ships; luggage, spirit-casks, and packages are\r\nbeing wheeled or shouldered off for debarkation. A couple of sailors,\r\nwith hands across to form a sedan, are carrying a stout lady of fashion\r\ndown to a lighter. Jack on shore and Jack taking his chest seawards are\r\nelbowing busy stevadores. A commander, his lady, and a porter bearing\r\nhis sea-trunk, are in the centre of the crowd; a wooden-legged fiddler\r\nis tipping a stave for 'Poll and her partner Joe,' and a frolicsome\r\ntar is giving a parting salute with more ardour than propriety. On one\r\nside is the respectable element--the admirals, captains, and other\r\nnaval officers, and their families, who are parting from wife and\r\nchildren with a tender embrace at the door of the Ship Tavern; and\r\nmany a gallant naval hero is draining his last bowl of punch on shore.\r\nOn the opposite side such rougher contrasts are exhibited as common\r\nsailors, lodging houses, outfitting emporiums, cast clothes marts,\r\nand ship-store shops, _Moses Levy--Money Lent_, and similar tempting\r\nemporiums, where customers are inspecting second-hand apparel. Such a\r\nspectacle would not be complete, according to the taste of the times or\r\nthe actualities of the case, without some sort of uproariousness, and\r\nso we are treated to the sight of a young lady carted off helplessly\r\ninebriated, a friendly companion supporting her shoulders, and an\r\nhonest blue-jacket bearing her legs unceremoniously slung over his\r\nback. Another bacchanalian incident is rendered on the left, where a\r\ngrinning sailor, half-seas over, who is at least better-tempered in\r\nhis cups than George Cruikshank would have condescended to draw him\r\nin his teetotal days, is sprawling on the road by his broken pipe and\r\noverbalancing a florid and equally tipsy Venus, his lady-love, who is\r\nin some degree the reason of the Jack Tar's degradation.\r\n\r\n_September 15, 1814._ _The Three Principal Requisites to form a Man of\r\nFashion: Dress like a coachman; study boxing and bull-baiting; speak\r\nthe slang language fluently._\r\n\r\n_September 15, 1814._ _The Four Seasons of Love._ Rowlandson del.\r\nPublished by T.

To which appeal\r\nthe melting and buxom widow responds: 'You enchanting devil, I do not\r\nknow what to say to you; however, Mr. Thimble, that mole between your\r\neyebrows puts me so much in mind of my poor dear departed husband that\r\nI think I can't refuse you.'\r\n\r\n_Summer._--The wedded pair are enjoying a suburban excursion. The\r\nsmartened tailor is smiling on his wife and declaring: 'O thou wert\r\nborn to please me, my life, my only dear!' The lady, who is advancing\r\nin life, replies: 'Ay, now you look a little stylish; you are a\r\ncharming man. Who would not be married!'\r\n\r\n_Autumn_ sets in more stormily; the lady, developing into a virago,\r\nis accusing her husband of receiving letters of a tender nature; the\r\ntailor, in reply, is making a counter-charge, relative to 'Mr. Dip, the\r\ndyer, and gallivanting to White Conduit House.'\r\n\r\n_Winter_ sees the late couple seated at either side of a lawyer's\r\ntable; the man of law is reading the articles of separation, to the\r\ndelight of the Thimbles. Mrs. Tabitha declares she never felt so\r\ncomfortable in all her life; and Jerry Thimble is exclaiming: 'O\r\nblessed day!

Tegg\r\n(341).--Rowlandson availed himself of the novel religious fever which\r\nhad its rise in the fictitious revelations of the so-called Prophetess,\r\nJoanna Southcott, to ridicule both the believers in latter day miracles\r\nand the members of the Establishment conjointly. One specimen of the\r\ncaricatures produced on this occasion will suffice. Joanna Southcott\r\nand one of her champions are making a terrific charge on the flying\r\npillars of the Episcopacy. The Bishops are endeavouring to kick against\r\nthe onslaught, and, with mitre, wig, and crozier, are defying their\r\nchastisers; but their courage is feeble, their ranks are breaking, and\r\nthey are running off discomfited to save themselves from the coming\r\nwrath, without taking any heed of the overthrown. The Prophetess,\r\nwearing her famous seal round her neck, and clad in _Elijah's mantle_,\r\nis lustily wielding a birch rod; she has caught a fugitive Archbishop\r\nby the foot, and he is vainly struggling to escape corporal correction.\r\nThe 'Third Book of Wonders' is open at her feet. Her exertions are\r\nsupported by a certain Rev. Roger Towzer, who is chastising the\r\ndisorganised heads of the Established Church with his _Flail_; certain\r\nsupernatural creatures, with flaming torches and stings and claws, are\r\nharassing the runaways. The Prophetess is very earnest in the work:\r\n'Lay it on, hip and thigh, brave Towzer; smite the unbelievers. I\r\nput no more trust in Bishops as men than I do in their chariots and\r\nhorses, but my trust is in the Lord of Hosts.' Her reverend follower\r\nis bruising away vigorously: 'I'll well dust their woolsacks and make\r\nthem drunk in my fury.

The game in view, a military buck, is 'run\r\nto ground' in a summer-house, on the opposite side of the water, where,\r\nin spite of a warning-board about _Man-traps_, he is visibly poaching\r\non the hunter's preserves.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1815.\r\n\r\n\r\n_January 1, 1815._ _Female Politicians._ Published by T.

'Oh, the wretch!' cries\r\nan old maid. A less antiquated lady is giving her fair neighbour the\r\ncomforting assurance, 'It's very true, ma'am: it's only a word and a\r\nblow with him; your honour or your property.' 'Well, ma'am,' declares\r\na buxom creature, 'if he should come here, at all events I'll take\r\ncare of my property.' To which a budding maiden is adding, 'So will I,\r\nmamma.'\r\n\r\n_March 1, 1815._ _Breaking up of the Blue Stocking Club._ Published\r\nby T. Tegg (343).--The dissolution of this assembly is marked by a\r\ncertain amount of animosity and fury. The learned ladies are engaging\r\nin pairs, and the subject under discussion is handled with more zeal\r\nthan discretion, the arguments employed being chiefly forcible. The\r\n_Blue Stockings_ are sadly mauled; garments and hair are alike torn\r\nand dishevelled. The table, the tea equipage, and the president's\r\narmchair have all come to grief; one fair and fierce debater is trying\r\nto impress her opponent with the kettle-stand, another has floored her\r\nadversary, and is pouring forth the boiling contents of the urn over a\r\nprostrate foe. Nails, fists, and feet are alike set to work; but the\r\nfavourite method of attack seems to be a firm purchase of the enemy's\r\ntresses. Cats are leaping about in dismay, and the whole tableau is one\r\nof unrestrained ferocity and recklessness.\r\n\r\n_March 1, 1815._ _Defrauding the Customs, or Shipping Goods not\r\nFairly Entered._ Rowlandson del. Published by T. Tegg (344).--A scene\r\nof violence, since a pair of strapping damsels, the pride of their\r\nfriends, are being carried off bodily, whether they will or no, by two\r\nnaval officers, whose sailors are waiting by the shore, with a boat\r\nput to sea in readiness to bear them, and their abducted charges, off\r\nto a ship which is seen at a distance. These unprincipled marauders\r\nhave made an attack, in broad daylight, on the two biggest and most\r\nhandsome scholars of _Mrs. Crostich's boarding-school for young\r\nladies_, while the remainder of the tender flock are taking their walks\r\nabroad, with the dame at their head. But neither the vigorous efforts\r\nof the schoolmistress, nor the exertions of an old gentleman, who has\r\nbeen knocked over in the escape, and is sprawling powerless like a\r\nturtle, nor the efforts of a dog which is worrying the retreat of the\r\nfugitives, seem likely to hinder the accomplishment of their flight or\r\nto prevent the successful completion of their lawless designs.\r\n\r\n_March 1, 1815._ _Hodge's Explanation of a Hundred Magistrates._\r\nPublished by T. Tegg (347).--Hodge, 'a poor honest country lout, not\r\noverstocked with learning,' has been brought before the bench on some\r\ncharge or another. The smock-frocked rustic, cap in hand, is scratching\r\nhis tow-like locks and questioning the fairness of the tribunal. 'How,'\r\ncries the chairman, energetically thumping away at the table in his\r\nindignation, 'how dare you, fellow, say it is unfair to bring you\r\nbefore one hundred magistrates, when you see there are but three of\r\nus?' In reply to which Hodge is posing his interrogator: 'Why, please\r\nyour worship, you mun know when I went to school they taught I that a\r\none and two noughts stood for a hundred; so, do you see, your worship\r\nbe one, and the other two be cyphers!'\r\n\r\n_March 1, 1815._ _Sailors Drinking the Tunbridge Waters._ Published\r\nby T. Tegg (242).--The artist has sketched the old drinking-well at\r\nTunbridge; a body of sailors, true British tars, find themselves, by\r\nsome queer chance, which is totally unexplained, at the well-known\r\nwatering-place, and, what is more mysterious, these sons of Neptune are\r\nin close proximity to the Springs. A comely, well-favoured, and smartly\r\nattired young damsel, the ministering nymph of the fountain--which,\r\nin this instance, it must be confessed, closely resembles a pump--is\r\npresenting a tumbler of the fluid, drawn by her own fair hands, to a\r\nsturdy ancient coxswain, impressing on the weather-beaten salt, 'Be\r\nassured it is an excellent beverage for gentlemen who have been a long\r\ntime at sea.' The ancient mariner, in recalling the effects which the\r\nwaters had on 'our Poll,' and remembering his own personal interior\r\nsufferings in the Mediterranean, is reluctant to rush into unknown\r\ndangers: 'Why, lookee, ma'am, I don't wish to be unpolite, but, if your\r\nladyship's honour pleases, I'd rather hang fire a bit.' Another hardy\r\ntar is grappling with the distasteful difficulty and making frightful\r\nattempts to swallow the contents of his tumbler; but a good proportion\r\nof the water is spilt on the ground, while he is pronouncing the stuff\r\n'Dashed queer tipple, to be sure!' Another smart sailor has his tumbler\r\nall safe in his keeping; but he is bribing a diminutive native, who\r\nis complacently staring at the prospective drinker, to run and fetch\r\nsomething to qualify the cup. 'Hark'ee, young two-shoes, go and get me\r\na pint of half-and-half and a squeeze of lemon, for darn me if I could\r\ndrink it neat if I was never to weigh anchor again.'\r\n\r\n_March 13, 1815._ _A Lamentable Case of a Juryman._ Published by T.\r\nTegg (Nos. 220 and 347).\r\n\r\n_April 7, 1815._ _The Flight of Buonaparte from Hell-Bay._ Published\r\nby R. Ackermann.--We find the anticipations offered in the caricatures\r\nof the previous year completely upset by Napoleon's unexpected return.\r\nThe method of the Corsican's evasion is treated figuratively; in place\r\nof the Isle of Elba he is supposed to have escaped from the clutches of\r\nthe evil one and out of the depths of the infernal regions. The foul\r\nfiend, _Old Scratch_, is represented in person, amusing himself by\r\nletting his captive loose to work fresh mischief in the world above.\r\nA diabolic armchair of serpents is planted beside the fiery lake, and\r\nfor pastime Satan is toying with a pipe and blowing air-bubbles, while\r\nan attendant imp is holding a saucer of suds. The Corsican has been\r\nmounted on a bubble blown by the tempter, and then sent careering back\r\nto earth; hissing dragons, and serpents of supernatural species, are\r\nhissing forth flames and blasts of fury, which are serving as winds to\r\nwaft the bubble upwards, while the sulphurous fumes are inspiring the\r\nrider with a frantic thirst for vengeance.\r\n\r\n_April 8, 1815._ _Hell Hounds Rallying round the Idol of France._\r\nPublished by R. Ackermann.--The enthusiasm with which the return of\r\n'Boney' was hailed, from his landing in France till his arrival in\r\nthe capital, and the devoted reception he encountered from his old\r\nfollowers, are made the subjects of more than one travesty. In the\r\npresent case the head and bust of the Emperor, on a colossal scale--his\r\nthroat encircled by a hangman's noose--is elevated on an immense\r\npyramid of human heads, his decapitated victims; a brace of demons are\r\nflying through the air to encircle the brow of this apostle of freedom\r\nwith a crown of blazing pitch. A ring of excited demons, with horns,\r\nclaws, hoofs, and tails, but bearing the heads and faces of Napoleon's\r\nsupporters, are dancing in triumph round the idol they have replaced.\r\nFrom labels attached to the ropes which surround the throttles of these\r\nenthusiastic Bonapartists we discover the so-called 'Hell Hounds' to\r\nbe Marshals Ney, Lefebre, Davoust, Vandamme, Savery, Caulincourt, with\r\nFouché, and others. The old slaughters have recommenced; towns are\r\ncommitted to the flames, English goods are once more destroyed, and\r\nheaped around are soldiers, some dead and others wounded, to serve the\r\ncause of a rapacious ambition which had drained the blood of France for\r\nyears.\r\n\r\n1815. _Vive le Roi! Vive l'Empereur! Vive le Diable! French Constancy\r\nand French Integrity._--As might have been foreseen, Napoleon's old\r\nascendency over the French army asserted itself more strongly than\r\never; the intermediate state of things and the humiliations to which\r\nthe country was unavoidably forced to submit during the process of\r\nrestoring the stolen property and possessions to the rightful owners\r\nhad increased the national animosity with which the troops and the\r\npeople continued to regard the foreign invaders, friends, allies, and\r\nupholders of _Louis le Desiré_. The more martial spirits, wearied of a\r\nrestoration with which France felt no sympathy, began to languish for\r\nthe presence of their great captain, under whose military empire their\r\nlaurels had been won. The fickleness and instability of the Gallic\r\nrace are set forth in the present caricature. A trooper has abjured\r\nhis allegiance to the Bourbons, and is hailing his Corporal with a\r\npinch from his snuffbox; his hat is still garnished with the white\r\ncockade, _Vive le Roi!_ above it is a red one, _Vive le Diable!_ and,\r\non the other side, the famous tricolor, and _Vive l'Empereur!_ _French\r\nConstancy_ is illustrated in these interchanged emblems. _French\r\nStability_ appears figuratively likened to the sails of a windmill; as\r\nto _French Integrity_, the emblems of a monkey and cat, kissing and\r\nfondling, pictorially sets forth the 'union between the National Guard\r\nand the troops of the line.'\r\n\r\n_April 12, 1815._ _Scene in a New Pantomime, to be performed at the\r\nTheatre Royal, Paris. With entire new music, dances, dresses, scenery,\r\nmachinery, &c., &c. The principal characters to be supported by most of\r\nthe great potentates in Europe. Harlequin by Monsieur Napoleon; Clown\r\nby King of Wirtemberg; Pantaloon, Emperor of Austria. To conclude with\r\na comic song, to be sung by the Pope, and a grand chorus by the Crowned\r\nHeads. Vivant Rex et Regina._ Published by R. Ackermann.--The wonderful\r\nexhibition is taking place in the state rooms of the Tuileries. The\r\ngreat throne is empty, and the sceptre and crown are temporarily laid\r\non the steps waiting for their owner. _Presto!_ and in flies Harlequin\r\nBonaparte, pursued at once by all the Powers of Europe, tumbling over\r\none another in confusion, but all armed and aiming at the nimble\r\nsprite, who had given them so much trouble to capture and secure, and\r\nwho is once more to be chased, caught, and bound down again. Clown\r\nWirtemberg is letting off a brace of pistols; Dutch Mynheer and a\r\nPrussian grenadier are discharging their blunderbusses; Austria, as\r\nPantaloon, is too startled to be effective; the Cossack is giving\r\nthe fugitive a prod with his long lance; the King of Spain has drawn\r\nthe sword and aimed such a blow that it has capsized the swordsman\r\nand shaken off his crown; the Pope is armed with an axe; and all the\r\nother potentates are crowding in, an irregular mob. The portrait of\r\nthe Empress, as Columbine, is being taken off the walls. As to the\r\nHarlequin, his eye looks dangerous; a dagger is held in either hand-he\r\nevidently means mischief; one tiger-like spring, and he has eluded\r\nall his pursuers, and the blows they are intending for him recoil on\r\nthemselves. The portrait of Louis the Eighteenth is in the pathway\r\nfor which he is making, and the nimble Corsican, in his character of\r\nHarlequin, is jumping clean through the huge paunch of the tranquil\r\nBourbon and regaining the security of his old strongholds.\r\n\r\n_April 16, 1815._ _The Corsican and his Blood Hounds at the Window of\r\nthe Tuileries, looking over Paris._ Published by R. Ackermann.--Boney,\r\non his arrival in Paris, proceeded to his old quarters in the\r\nTuileries, whence Louis the Eighteenth had but just departed.\r\nNapoleon, in spite of his fatigue--for he had barely rested since\r\nhis landing--sat up all night, concerting fresh measures with his\r\nsupporters; and in the morning he held a grand review in the Champ de\r\nMars, where his presence excited the most frantic demonstrations of\r\nfidelity. France showed herself intoxicated with joy at the chance\r\nof receiving back a leader with whom she had, inconsistently enough,\r\nparted without expressing much emotion or regret, except so far as\r\nthe Emperor's more immediate personal adherents were concerned. In\r\nthe picture we have the streets of Paris represented as being filled\r\nwith a surging multitude of enthusiasts, while standards, eagles, and\r\nheads of enemies are held up on pikes, by the wilder fanatics, as signs\r\nof encouragement. _Death_ and the _Devil_ are tempting the Corsican\r\nfrom the balcony of the Tuileries; in 'return for more horrors,' and\r\nin exchange for 'death and destruction,' all that he sees is offered\r\nthe conqueror. The bony skeleton is pointing out the bargain with his\r\ndart; but Time's hourglass is standing unperceived at Napoleon's side\r\nand the sand is running forth. The figure of the Devil is resting his\r\narms fraternally on the shoulders of Boney and Marshal Ney and drawing\r\nthem into an ill-starred embrace. The other marshals and adherents are\r\nin the rear; but a marked expression of apprehension is shown on the\r\nfaces of the entire party, with the exception of the two supernatural\r\nvisitors, who are grinning at the anticipation of fresh iniquities\r\nand increasing deadly horrors, with which they entertain the certain\r\nprospect of being gratified by their pet _protégé_.\r\n\r\n_May 10, 1815._ _The Carter and the Gipsies._ Published by T. Tegg.\r\n\r\n1815. _R. Ackermann's Transparency on the Victory of Waterloo._--The\r\nloyal supporters of the Government and that indomitable British nation\r\nwhich had declared '_no surrender_ to the Corsican,' and, either in\r\nvictory or defeat, had persevered, while their allies were conquered\r\nand their subsidies wasted, were rewarded for the 'outpouring of\r\nblood and treasure abroad' and the hard times and anxieties at home\r\nby finding that at last, after Waterloo, their enemy was at their\r\nmercy. Rejoicings, fireworks, and illuminations became the order of the\r\nday; and our artist, who had traced the varying career of the dreaded\r\nbugbear Boney, now lent his assistance to commemorate his downfall. In\r\nRowlandson's simple allegory Buonaparte, on his white Arab charger,\r\nis riding his hardest away from the British pursuit; he has lost his\r\nsword, and his crown is shaken off. Wellington, with his sword ready to\r\nsmite, is rapidly coming up with the fugitive, whose flight, however,\r\nis unexpectedly brought to an end by finding old Blucher, on his sturdy\r\ncharger, drawn up across the very path he is taking. The redoubtable\r\nveteran is discharging a huge blunderbuss full in the face of the\r\ncommon enemy. Incidents in the pursuit of the routed French legions are\r\nslightly indicated in the background, and a flight of certain gilded\r\nbirds are scurrying out of the dangerous vicinity.\r\n\r\n_July 28, 1815._ _Boney's Trial, Sentence, and Dying Speech, or\r\nEurope's Injuries Revenged._--Napoleon is arraigned, as a criminal at\r\nthe bar, before the Court of Europe and a crowded tribunal; the seat of\r\nchief judge is occupied by Prince Blucher, and the assembled potentates\r\nare seated on the bench, wearing their recovered crowns, which the\r\nprisoner, in his various triumphs, had so often caused to tremble and,\r\nin some cases, had carried off completely. The kings, it is true, do\r\nnot make an imposing spectacle; with the exception of the Emperor\r\nAlexander, who is seated beside the Prince Regent, they still seem to\r\nlook upon the lately dreaded foe with trepidation. The occupants of the\r\ncourt and the lawyers are regarding the criminal under sentence with\r\nabhorrence; a _posse_ of tipstaves are drawn up below the prisoner's\r\nbar; and Napoleon, who is trying to move the compassion of his hearers\r\nby hypocritical humility, has a friend at his back, who is ready to\r\nseize his bond--the Black Fiend is his unseen attendant prompter in\r\nperson. Old Blucher, clad in his field-marshal's uniform, with the\r\naddition of a judge's wig, is standing up, and, with emphatic gestures,\r\nis pointing to the act of accusation set forth at length on a screen\r\nin the court: 'Napoleon Bonaparte, the first and last by the wrath\r\nof Heaven, ex-Emperor of the Jacobins, and Head-Runner of Runaways,\r\nstands indicted: 1. For the murder of Captain Wright in the Temple, at\r\nParis. 2. For the murder of the Duke D'Enghien, Pichegru, and Georges.\r\n3. For the murder of Palm, Hofer, &c., &c. 4. For the murder of the\r\ntwelve inhabitants of Moscow. 5. For innumerable robberies committed\r\non all nations in Christendom and elsewhere. 6. For bigamy; and lastly\r\nfor returning from transportation and setting the world in an uproar.'\r\nThe inflexible judge is hurling forth his condemnation: 'You, Nap\r\nBonaparte, being found guilty of all these crimes, it is fallen to my\r\nlot to pronounce sentence of death on you. You are to be hung by the\r\nneck for one hour till you are _dead, dead, dead_, and your body to\r\nbe chained to a millstone and sunk in the sea at Torbay.' The fallen\r\nEmperor is naturally much moved at this final judgment, and he is\r\ninterceding for a respite: 'Oh, cruel Blucher! oh, cruel Wellington!\r\nit is you that have brought me to this end. Oh, magnanimous Emperors,\r\nKings, and Princes, intercede for me and spare my life, and give me\r\ntime to atone for all my sins. My son, Napoleon the Second, will reward\r\nyou for mercy shown me!'\r\n\r\n_November, 1815._ _Transparency Exhibited at R. Ackermann's, in the\r\nStrand, on November 27, 1815, the day on which the General Peace was\r\ncelebrated in London._--As all England was exerting itself to display\r\nits loyalty and the universal delight occasioned by the conclusion\r\nof the Continental wars, Rowlandson contributed a characteristic\r\ncartoon, which appeared, like its predecessors, outside the Repository\r\nof Arts, allegorically commemorating the downfall of 'Boney' and the\r\nsecond restoration of the legitimate reigning house. The design of\r\nthis transparency was arranged in the form of a monument, capped by a\r\nthrone; at the base is a trophy; the Prince of Wales's plume is waving\r\nabove two gilt tablets, inscribed with the names of the two victorious\r\ngenerals, Wellington and Blucher, and surrounded by pieces of\r\ndismounted artillery and groups of standards, with the Union Jack and\r\nthe Russian and Prussian flags in front. Above this group is a base,\r\ninscribed, 'Peace throughout Europe,' with a tablet, '_Charlemagne,\r\nNassau, Capet, Bourbon_,' and two wreaths, dedicated to '_Humanity_'\r\nand '_Justice_.' Upon this platform a canopy is raised aloft, festooned\r\nabove the throne of St. Louis, with the restored crown; a serpent,\r\nemblematic of eternity, and the three doves; the front of the seat is\r\nsupported by bundles of fasces, with double axes, and classic wreaths\r\nand lyres. A flight of steps mounts up to the throne on either side.\r\nOn the right is Wellington, supporting Louis XVIII., restored to his\r\nrights; his train are following the ascent of their sovereign, and the\r\nfigure of _Justice_ is floating on the clouds above the monarch's head.\r\n_Fame_ is blowing her trumpet on the other side; while Bonaparte and\r\nhis baffled supporters are effecting a rapid descent by the left-hand\r\nstaircase; Blucher, standing on the top step, is making their defeat\r\nsecure by a discharge from his huge blunderbuss. Bodies of the Allied\r\ntroops are drawn up at the base; on the right a group of Cossacks, with\r\nPrussian and English cavalry; on the left is a gathering of the various\r\nfoot-soldiers. A sturdy Highlander is putting the finishing stroke to\r\na discomfited plotting Bonapartist with his bayonet, and summarily\r\nstamping out Imperialist intriguers.\r\n\r\n_July 14, 1815._ _Easter Monday, or the Cockney Hunt._--Designed,\r\netched, and published by T. Rowlandson, 1 James Street, Adelphi. In\r\nclearing a gate, after the hounds, a little antiquated sportsman has\r\nmissed his seat and is going over his horse's ears; behind him is a\r\ndashing Diana, who is spurring her horse over the palings of a park in\r\ngallant style.\r\n\r\n_November 16, 1815._ _My Ass._ Designed and etched by T. Rowlandson.\r\nWritten by Mr. J. Tedir. Published by I. Sidebotham, 96 Strand.--The\r\nadventures of a hawker of vegetables and her faithful donkey, depicted\r\nin a series of six cuts, illustrating the invaluable qualities of the\r\nquadruped. The composition commences thus:--\r\n\r\n    Who followed me through street and lane,\r\n    In spite of hurricane and rain;\r\n    While I my daily bread did gain?\r\n                                  My Ass.\r\n\r\nThe other verses being in the same strain.\r\n\r\n1815. _Measuring Substitutes for the Army of Reserve._--In 1815, owing\r\nto the French wars, soldiers were necessarily at a premium; and, from\r\nan advertisement in the justices' room, where the substitutes are being\r\nmeasured, we learn that the bounty was fixed at 30_l._ per man. Those\r\ngreat functionaries, a country justice and his clerk, appear seated\r\nin state, to warrant the proceedings. A commanding officer and his\r\nsergeant are labouring prodigiously, for the needs of the service, to\r\nforce certain stunted and misshapen rustics, who have been enlisted to\r\nserve their country, up to the military standard. Further relays of\r\nungainly 'chawbacons' are waiting their turn without.\r\n\r\n1815. _A Journeyman Tailor._--A half-clad slave of the thimble is shown\r\nsquatting on his board in a squalid hovel; his half-starved 'helper'\r\nis seated by his side; both are pressing garments with hot irons, and\r\na rough and ragged urchin is heating a further supply of the article\r\nknown as 'a tailor's goose' at the grate; while a street hawker, a\r\nblowsy Hibernian, is screaming her wares (cucumbers and cabbages) in\r\nat the doorway. This picture bears some resemblance to a caricature\r\npublished by Rowlandson in 1823, under the title _Hot Goose, Cabbage,\r\nand Cucumbers_.\r\n\r\n1815. _Neighbours._ Published by T. Tegg (235).--The wooden casements\r\nof two windows, which turn on one post connecting the houses, are\r\nthrown back, and simultaneously a neat-looking young farmer and\r\na well-favoured young damsel are stooping forward and their lips\r\nmeeting in a cheerful salute, to the horror and scandal of two elderly\r\nwitnesses, who are expressing their reprobation at the openness of the\r\nproceeding. The young swain at the same moment is trying to hang up a\r\ncage, which appropriately contains a pair of cooing doves.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: AN EATING-HOUSE.]\r\n\r\n1815 (?). _An Eating-house._\r\n\r\n1815 (_about_). _Banditti._--The occupants of the house attacked,\r\nconfined to the female members, are sleeping, without suspicion of\r\nthe danger which is to surprise them. A band of ill-favoured and\r\nrepulsive-featured freebooters, provided with a miscellaneous armoury\r\nof slaughterous-looking weapons, are stealing in on deadly mischief\r\nbent. The scene is dramatic.\r\n\r\n1815. _Virtue in Danger._\r\n\r\n    Careful observers, studious of the town,\r\n    Shun the misfortunes that disgrace the clown.--GAY'S _Trivia_.\r\n\r\nAn old boy who has ventured unprotected--beyond the guardianship of\r\nan umbrella which bears a family resemblance to the holder--amidst\r\nthe dangers of the wicked town, is forcibly taken possession of by\r\ntwo shameless nymphs; one is stealing his money, while the other is\r\nhelping herself to his watch. The elderly and corpulent stranger is too\r\nastonished at this barefaced iniquity to offer the feeblest resistance.\r\nThe night watchman is going his rounds, and enjoying a laugh at the\r\nexpense of the victim; this trustworthy guardian of the streets is\r\ntoo evidently a confederate of the predative fair, and is personally\r\ninterested in the plunder.\r\n\r\n1815 (?). _An Unexpected Return, or a Snip in Danger._\r\n\r\n1815 (?). _A Musical Doctor and his Scholars._\r\n\r\n1815 (?). _Slap-bang Shop._--The interior of an eating-house in the\r\ncity. A tall, well-formed, and comely waitress is bringing in the\r\ndinner of a wicked old reprobate, who is leering his admiration of her\r\npersonal attractions. All the venerable sinners, amateurs of female\r\nloveliness, shown taking their meals in the various boxes, are turning\r\ntheir heads to gloat over the charms of this favoured handmaiden, who\r\nis followed by a 'help' carrying pots of beer for the various customers.\r\n\r\n1815. _Jack Tar admiring the Female Sex._\r\n\r\n1815. _Accidents will Happen._--This, and the following subjects, to\r\nthe number of half-a-dozen, are selected from prints in some degree\r\npirated from Rowlandson, and, although bearing his name in the corner,\r\nin many instances the incidents of well-known caricatures have been\r\naltered, and prints have been issued, engraved in an inferior style, as\r\nnew caricatures. The principal of these adaptations, or poor renderings\r\nof drawings, were published by Marks. _Accidents will Happen_\r\nintroduces a cellar incident. A maid has begun to descend the stairs to\r\ndraw some beer, and has come to grief, probably from fright, as files\r\nof scared rats are scampering away, and a cat is tearing up the wall,\r\nwhile a mischievous monkey has broken loose from his chain. The shock\r\nhas caused the damsel to lose her balance, her pitcher is broken, and\r\nshe is sprawling in an attitude which has astonished her master, who,\r\ncandle in hand, is coming down the winding stairs of the cellar to\r\nsurvey the scene of the disaster.\r\n\r\n1815. _Sympathy._--This emotion is rendered in the feelings of a stern\r\nfunctionary, evoked in favour of a lady in Bridewell, who is being led\r\nout of the cells by the warder to be flogged, a punishment which, it\r\nwould seem, had not been abolished in Rowlandson's day. The eye of the\r\ncoarse and elephantine jailer is gloating over the fair back of the\r\nunfortunate criminal, laid bare for the application of the cat.\r\n\r\n1815. _Despatch, or Jack preparing for Sea._--Jack Tar is making the\r\nmost of his opportunities on shore; he is surrounded by the delights\r\nwhich constitute the sailor's elysium; punch and grog galore, a brace\r\nof fiddlers, and a bevy of beauties, florid Pollies of Portsmouth,\r\ntowards whom he is making tipsy demonstrations of affection. In those\r\ndays, when prize-money fell in golden showers, the valiant sea-dogs\r\nwho defended our shores, and made John Bull's name redoubtable on\r\nthe ocean, were able to command, in their short intervals on shore,\r\nluxuries after their own hearts, for which, after the dangers and\r\nhardships of active service, they threw away their 'yellow boys' with\r\nthe recklessness which characterised their habits, and proved a rich\r\nharvest to the plunderers who were on the watch for seamen just 'paid\r\noff.'\r\n\r\n1815. _Deadly Lively._--The coarse humours of a spirit-cellar are\r\nserved up with a tragic accompaniment. A young female is stretched\r\nincapable and asleep, sunk in all the degradation of dead drunkenness.\r\nA man who is no longer master of himself is raising his tumbler,\r\nwith a tipsy desire to have it replenished. The apparition of King\r\nDeath, bony, frightful, and sinister, is grinning over the back of\r\nthe soddened tippler's chair, recruiting his legions from a fruitful\r\nsource; he is supplying the rummer of the drunken wretch from his own\r\nvial, little more fatal than the fluid which is debasing and deadening\r\nits victims around. A stout woman, also sinking into tipsy apathy,\r\nis roused by the shock of finding the king of terrors added to the\r\ncompany; she is thrown off her balance with a start, and, falling\r\nbackwards on the stone floor of the vault, she will probably break her\r\nneck--as the artist's intention seems to hint--and furnish Death with\r\nanother customer.\r\n\r\n1815. _The Fort._\r\n\r\n1815.

A board\r\nabove the head of the engrosser proclaimed his calling: '_Qui si fanno\r\nmemoriali, lettere, ed altre scritture, nel ottimo stilo moderno._'\r\n(Here are drawn up memorials, letters, and other writings, in the best\r\nmodern style.) Ever eager to seize any opportunity of observing the\r\nmanners and national character of a people whom I have every reason to\r\nthink better of than some of our superficial magpie-tourists, I pressed\r\nforward to obtain a nearer view of the transactions of this universal\r\nsecretary, when my companion, Don Michele, pulling me back by the skirt\r\nof my coat, begged I would not demean myself by thus mixing with the\r\nvulgar.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n'The composer of letters was just receiving from an elderly woman\r\nthe sum of six _grani_ (about threepence) for an epistle he had\r\nindited to her son at _Bari_; after which a farmer, next in rotation,\r\nwas admitted into presence. His business appeared to be on secret\r\nservice, for the corresponding oracle politely requested some of the\r\nmore curious auditors to step a little aside. At first, indeed, the\r\nfarmer's instructions were conveyed in a whisper; but as a Neapolitan\r\nloves dearly to talk as loud as his lungs will let him, and to\r\naccompany his sermocinations with the most expressive gestures, it\r\nsoon became less difficult to discover that the subject under present\r\nconsideration was a horse which had been sold to a cavalry officer,\r\nand for which a balance was still owing; the prompt payment whereof\r\nwas to be peremptorily insisted on by a respectful dun. As soon as a\r\nperiod was happily brought to paper, it was read over to the listening\r\nclodhopper, who, in a manner, beat time to the emphatic and rhythmical\r\nreading of the professor by periodical nods of the head, and at\r\nthe end of the sentence expressed his astonishment at the sagacity\r\nwith which his obscure ideas had been caught up and classified.\r\nThis literary production, owing probably to the importance of the\r\nsubject, was disposed of for the valuable consideration of eight\r\n_grani_ (fourpence), paper included; and its possessor, with inward\r\nsatisfaction, left the oracular tripod, in order to make room for a\r\nTurkish captain of a _polacca_, whose literary necessities consisted in\r\na memorial claiming the restitution of some goods illegally seized....\r\nWhen the document was ready for signature, _Ibrahim Reis_, who could\r\nneither read nor write, was desired to make his _cross_ at foot, which\r\nhe refused with religious abhorrence; but, dipping his little finger\r\ninto the inkstand, imprinted on the paper a correct facsimile of the\r\ntortuous furrows of his cuticle by way of signet. To my great surprise,\r\nthis state paper was valued at no more than one carlin (fivepence),\r\nalthough engrossed on a folio page and decorated with some fancifully\r\nflourished initials.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE LETTER-WRITER.]\r\n\r\n'The Turk no sooner discharged his literary debt than a well-dressed\r\nyoung lass gained his place. (This interview is pictured forth in the\r\nartist's illustration.) The despatch, however, which was to be written\r\nfor her, must have been on secret and confidential service, for the\r\ninstructions she gave to the engrosser were communicated in so low a\r\nwhisper that, from my observatory, the scene appeared one of purely\r\npantomimical action. When I relate that the time employed by this\r\nuniversal author in the production of the farmer's dun and the Turk's\r\nmemorial did not exceed half an hour, and that the contents, although\r\nsomewhat fustian, were very much to the purpose, you will agree with me\r\nthat Signor Bucatelli possessed talents far above his station. Indeed,\r\nDon Matteo assured me that he was as good a poet as an epistolary\r\nwriter, and that his sonnets on any particular occasion, such as for a\r\nwedding, a birthday, &c., may be obtained on the shortest notice, and\r\nat equally reasonable rates; in short, that he could wield his pen on\r\nany subject whatsoever.\r\n\r\n'To a publisher in England a man like Signor Bucatelli would be an\r\ninvaluable treasure, a host within himself, by the versatility of\r\nhis genius and the despatch of his literary labours: his charges of\r\n_authorship_, as you have seen, are consonant with the modesty of\r\ntrue genius. His elevated style of writing (truly _nel ottimo stilo\r\nmoderno_) would soon render him a most popular author with us. I\r\nwas just going to step down to give him the substance of a poetical\r\nepistle as a specimen of his abilities, when a little girl brought\r\nhim a small dish of stewed Windsor beans, a large raw cucumber, and a\r\ncrust of bread. This frugal fare, and a glass of iced water from the\r\nneighbouring stall, well calculated to preserve his intellectual powers\r\nunclogged, Don Matteo informed me, was the whole of his dinner; which,\r\ntogether with a cigar by way of dessert, interrupted his official\r\nduties for about half an hour, after which, if matters of pressing\r\nservice remained to be despatched, he would resume his quill, and\r\nsuspend his _siesta_, or afternoon nap, to a late hour of the day.'\r\n\r\n_Don Luigi's Ball._--Before leaving his apartments on the _Infrescata_\r\nthe writer was anxious, as a slight return for the kindness of his host\r\nand the hospitalities he had received in Naples, to give a dance to a\r\nfew friends of his own and of his entertainer, his host and friend Don\r\nMichele undertaking the entire responsibilities of inviting the guests,\r\nordering refreshments, decorating the chambers, and other preliminaries.\r\n\r\n'\"First, as to the company,\" reports the Don, \"there will be ten\r\ncouples, besides our family and odd ones, if they all come, of which\r\nthere is little doubt; and what is more, _gente di garbo_ (people of\r\nquality), such as you might suppose my friends to be. Three or four\r\nwill come in their own carriages; and some of the lasses will show you\r\nwhat is called dancing at Naples. Care, too, has been taken that they\r\nshould not want for good music; you will have, Signor Don Luigi, the\r\nfirst oboe of St. Carlo, two excellent violins, a flute, tenor, and\r\nvioloncel; my son will play the tambarine.\"\r\n\r\n'\"Six musicians, Don Michele, for this little dance! Why, that's out of\r\nall reason. Half the number----\"\r\n\r\n'\"Are _hired_; and the others, gentlemen high in the profession, who\r\nfor _my_ sake have promised to assist as friends at your party. Money,\r\nof course, is out of the question. You see, good sir, Don Michele\r\ncan command a thing or two. As many more would have come if I had\r\nasked them, but these will be sufficient to begin the evening with a\r\nlittle concert; my friend will give you a concerto on the oboe; one\r\nof the ladies will sing a _scena_ from an opera, to which we may add\r\na duet or two; and at ten o'clock the dance shall begin. As to the\r\nrefreshments, I have almost run my legs off to get you the rum (the\r\nladies were to be treated with ice punch, as a rarity). Seventy ices\r\nare ordered, cakes and sweetmeats as you desired, and a friend of mine\r\nwill lend us a dozen of wall chandeliers.\" These lights, connected\r\nwith festoons of artificial flowers, and a number of pots of flowers\r\nexhaling their fragrance over the rooms, gave the place an elegant\r\nappearance.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DON LUIGI'S BALL.]\r\n\r\n'The musicians arrived in good time, and the company dropped in\r\nfast after eight o'clock. To receive such a number of strange faces\r\nappropriately was a most irksome task,' continues the writer; 'but it\r\nwas alleviated by the sight of many a good-looking young lass, and two\r\nor three real beauties, and one especially, Donna Carlina. My English\r\nfriends from the city, and the lieutenant and doctor from the frigate,\r\nlikewise made their appearance in due time; and healthily as their\r\ncountenances shone forth, and well-dressed as they were, they greatly\r\neclipsed my Neapolitan bucks, and found much grace among the ladies. I\r\ncould not help remarking the contrast of manners between two Christian\r\ncountries. In a more northern latitude, persons coming to the party of\r\na perfect stranger would have conducted themselves with that cautious,\r\nanti-social reserve which some people call good manners; some of the\r\nladies would have sat down on their chairs as prim and as stiff as\r\nso many hop-poles, cast down their modest looks until spoken to by\r\ncharity, and then rebuffed a second attempt by a monosyllabic reply,\r\na \"Yes, sir,\" an \"Indeed, sir?\" a \"You are very good, sir,\" &c. Now I\r\nwill just tell you how matters went on in the _Infrescata_. Monstrous\r\nbows and introductory compliments: this over, all these people seemed\r\nas though they had been twenty times in my company.' The Don describes\r\nthe improvised introductory concert, at which nearly all the company\r\nassisted, the Neapolitans having a natural taste for melody, and most\r\nof them being fair musicians; the entertainer next gave orders to\r\nprepare for the dance, and to hand refreshments in the interval.\r\n\r\n'My punch,' he continues, 'found much favour with all present, the\r\nladies not excepted, who emptied their glasses as rapidly as if it had\r\nbeen lemonade. Although not dancing, I was fully employed in another\r\nway. With all our windows open, the strains of my numerous orchestra\r\npropagated their sound over the whole neighbourhood, some of whose\r\ninhabitants, impelled by the attraction of sweet sounds, could not\r\nresist favouring me with their company. The circumstance of their not\r\nbeing invited to the feast appeared to them a mere trifle not worthy\r\nof their attention; and an extraordinary celerity in decorating their\r\nexterior (which is all the essential part of a Neapolitan's full\r\ndress), would soon enable them to appear in company with Neapolitan\r\ndecency. To my great surprise, therefore, Don Michele and I had to\r\nreceive, from time to time, an influx of these unbidden guests, who in\r\nmost submissive language begged a thousand pardons for their freedom\r\nand intrusion. As Don Michele, my master of the ceremonies, seemed to\r\nknow them all, and, moreover, as I could neither help their coming,\r\nnor, when once arrived, turn them out, I thought it best to put a good\r\nface on the matter, and receive every one, especially the ladies, with\r\na hearty welcome (as pictured forth in the plate), assigning them\r\nplaces in the adjoining room, where I contrived to form another set of\r\ndances; for the number of these parasitical guests soon grew nearly\r\nequal to that of my standard company. As my company were now capering\r\naway in two of my apartments, I blush to confess that my resolution\r\nto keep my toes in a state of quiet quiescence was shaken at last. I\r\ncould have withstood the pressing solicitations of half-a-dozen of\r\nthese exhilarated damsels, but for the irresistible temptation of their\r\nanimated example, and of the excellent music. Fancy the loving smiles,\r\nthe glistening eyes, the seducing attitudes of these pretty Neapolitan\r\nbacchantes, and then ask your conscience how long any Christian, were\r\nhe even a Quaker or Moravian, could have stood proof against such\r\nattraction? The worst of the thing was, that having once broken my\r\nvow by dancing with Miss Carlina, a kind of rivalry ensued among the\r\nother ladies, most of whom now laid a successive claim to be led down a\r\ncountry dance by _il Signor Colonello_.\r\n\r\n'In the course of these pedestrian evolutions I thought I observed\r\nin several of my fair partners, cheerful as they had been before,\r\nan unusual and extraordinary access of spirits and gaiety; which,\r\nwith every allowance for the southern latitude and the ice punch (now\r\nadministered to them the more frugally by reason of the unlooked-for\r\nincrease in my numbers), I was at a loss to account for, till I saw\r\nmy man Benedetto whisper something into Don Michele's ear, which the\r\nlatter telegraphed into mine.\r\n\r\n'But before I let you into this secret it is proper that, like a\r\nskilful general, I should in my report give a correct description of\r\nthe localities of the field of battle. The kitchen belonging to my\r\napartments is on the same floor with them, and in this particular the\r\nNeapolitan system of domestic architecture is not different from what\r\nyou may have observed in a set of chambers, or in many old-fashioned\r\nmansions in England. Right opposite to the entrance of this kitchen\r\nof mine there is an elevated shelf, on which stand (I had better\r\nsay _stood_) my three wine-bottles, of immense calibre; the first\r\n(having been emptied since my stay in the _Infrescata_) then, and now,\r\ncontaining from six to eight gallons of excellent atmospheric air (such\r\nas you breathe at this altitude); the second, of similar dimensions,\r\nabout half full of delicious old _Pozzuoli_ wine; and the third,\r\nnot less in size, brim-full of the like grape-juice, with its fluid\r\noil-bung floating at the top.\r\n\r\n'No sooner did one of the damsels espy the forbidden shelf than the\r\nassault thereon was a settled matter: _veni, vidi, bibi_, was the\r\nword; and my delicious _Pozzuoli_ wine fell an easy prey to their\r\nsacrilegious hands and palate. _Implentur veteris Bacchi_, or, in plain\r\nEnglish, mesdames tippled till they had their fill, and what they left\r\nwas very nearly finished by four or five half-starved footmen and\r\nother hall rabble in attendance on their worthy masters; for when Don\r\nMichele went into the kitchen he found but a small remnant in one of\r\nthe bottles, which he secured in his own room.\r\n\r\n'Inspired with the juice and further excited by the agitation of\r\ndancing, most of my fair guests became still more exhilarated; some\r\ngrew ecstatically merry, and a few scarcely manageable. Surrounded\r\nby these voluptuous \"bacchæ,\" I feared the fate of Orpheus. Their\r\nfrolics, however, I must say to their credit, were chiefly levelled\r\nat Don Michele, probably because he had spoiled the continuation of\r\ntheir sport. The poor man had now to suffer all sorts of mischief for\r\nrefusing to join in their revels, till at last, for the sake of peace,\r\nhe consented to dance _one_ minuet, and no more. All was hushed in\r\nan instant, when he placed himself with his fortunate partner in the\r\nmiddle of the room, as stiff as buckram and as serious as if he were\r\noccupied with the solution of an algebraic problem. But no sooner had\r\nhe performed the first step or two, than, in turning his body with\r\ngrave elegance on the pivot of his toe, a pair of white silk garters\r\nwere seen gracefully dangling down his back, and describing, at every\r\nturn of his automaton body, a variety of flowing irregular curves\r\nin the circumambient air. The merriment which this unusual sight\r\noccasioned, was in vain attempted to be stifled in a muttered titter;\r\nit soon burst out with increased violence, his wife not excepted,\r\nwho heartily joined the general laugh, but informed her better half\r\nof the cause of the satisfaction he gave the company. When I learned\r\nthe extent of the spoliation committed upon my bin, I did not so\r\nmuch regret the actual loss I thereby sustained, as apprehend some\r\nunpleasant scenes of interruption to our festivity and mirth from the\r\nexcessive indulgence in the forbidden juice. However, whether it was\r\nowing to the excellence of the vintage, or to strength of constitution\r\nin the fair partakers, only one casualty occurred.\r\n\r\n'The dawn of morn was the signal for the gradual separation of the\r\ncompany, from all of whom, whether of the establishment or extra\r\nguests, I had received in the course of the evening the most pressing\r\nrequests to make their house my own; and to their credit I must say\r\nthat, as far as I have yet had time or inclination to try the sincerity\r\nof their invitations, I have had no cause to regret my complaisance.\r\n\r\n'When I relate that five leaden ice-moulds and eight of the\r\nconfectioner's pewter spoons were missing, you will scarcely suppose\r\nthat any of the good things, such as cakes, sweetmeats, &c., were\r\nsuffered to remain on the sideboard at the departure of my guests.\r\nWhether this practice not to \"leave a wreck behind\" is as general\r\nhere as in Malta, I am unable to decide. At the latter place, let the\r\nprovision be ever so abundant, what the stomach cannot compass the\r\npockets are sure to hold, and in stuffing those no great nicety is\r\nobserved; so the article is portable at all, it finds its way into one\r\nor the other of the pedestrian saddle-bags as by instinct. I have been\r\nassured by one of our officers that, at a great fête which General Fox\r\nrecently gave at Malta, one of the inhabitants (of sufficient rank to\r\nbe of the party) very dexterously, and, as he fancied, unobserved,\r\nslipped a small pullet, wrapt in his pocket-handkerchief, into one of\r\nhis side receptacles. Unfortunately, an officer near him, seeing the\r\nsleight-of-hand transaction, poured a dose of parsley and butter after\r\nit, saying very coolly, \"Allow me, sir, to help you to a little sauce\r\nat the same time.\"'\r\n\r\n1815. _The Dance of Death._ With illustrations, 2 vols., royal 8vo.\r\nPublished by R.

Ackermann, 101\r\nStrand.--Bullock's museum of natural curiosities was the receptacle for\r\nmost of the novelties introduced to the British public at the close\r\nof the eighteenth and the beginning of the nineteenth centuries. It\r\nwas here that the sight-seer might view the Laplanders with their deer\r\nand sledges, the Hottentot Venus, the Polish dwarf, the Irish giant,\r\nand other marvels for the curious which happened to hit the capricious\r\ntaste of the hour. It seems that the relics of the first Napoleon, made\r\nfamiliar enough to our generation at Madame Tussaud's Baker Street\r\nMuseum, were the chief attractions held out by the earlier Bullock in\r\n1816. The central point of the collection is the Emperor's travelling\r\ncarriage; ladies are swarming and climbing over the vehicle, being\r\npushed, dragged, and lifted into the inside, on to the driving-box,\r\nover the roof, into the boot behind, on the wheels, and, in fact,\r\nwherever a foothold can be secured. There is an animated attendance\r\nof visitors; the fair sex are particularly distinguishing themselves.\r\nOther personal relics of the Corsican are spread about, much as we\r\nsee them in our day; the bust of the exile is placed by the side of a\r\nmonkey, an illustration of the prejudice in which Napoleon was held\r\nat that period, which, by the way, is not unnatural, considering the\r\nexertions which the European bugbear had employed to ruin English\r\ncommerce and to alienate our possessions abroad.\r\n\r\n1816. _Bullock's London Museum, Piccadilly._[26]--'Mr. Bullock, having\r\npurchased Bonaparte's carriage of Major von Keller, has here exhibited\r\nit. It was taken by him at the entrance of the small town of Jenappe,\r\nat eleven o'clock on the night of June 18, 1815. A full account of the\r\ncarriage and its ingenious contents is to be found in the _Repository\r\nof Arts_ for February 1816.'\r\n\r\n_March 31, 1816._ _The Attempt to Wash the Blackamoor White. In the\r\nWhitehall, City of Laputa._--There is no publisher's name on this\r\nplate, and the explanation of the subject, a military scandal, is not\r\nso clear as could be desired. An officer, dressed as a hussar, is\r\nstanding in the centre, while being submitted to the whitewashing\r\nprocess; he wears no sword, and is holding a written defence in one\r\nhand. Above his head appears an arm, also belonging to an officer,\r\nwhich is menacing the hussar, who is appealing to his friends: 'O save\r\nmy honour. Rub away, my friend, rub it _home_. O, 'tis the phantom of\r\na horrid dream.' Another officer, from his uniform apparently in the\r\nGuards, is treading on a written 'oath,' and, with a pail of whitewash,\r\nis doing his best for the so-called 'Blackamoor,' declaring, 'We'll\r\nsay nothing about your honour!' Another friend, in a Highland uniform,\r\nevidently a person of rank, since he wears a red riband, and has a star\r\non his breast, is trying to obliterate the mark of a kick, which has\r\nleft an ugly outline of a foot on the white pantaloons of the injured\r\nindividual, but the impression is ineradicable: 'Deel o' me saul, mon,\r\nbut the stain of the foot will ne'er come oot.'\r\n\r\n1816 (?) _Bostonian Electors of Lancashire._ Published by W. Holland.\r\n\r\n1816. _Lady Hamilton at Home, or a Neapolitan Ambassador._--The outline\r\nof this subject, which is not without its interest as a contemporary\r\nsketch of a celebrated trio, is from an original drawing in the\r\ncollection of the present writer. There seems some discrepancy about\r\nthe date, since Sir William Hamilton died in 1803, and the sketch\r\nevidently belongs to the latter period of the ambassador's life. Sir\r\nWilliam Hamilton, whose collection of antiques formed a valuable\r\naddition to the national collection in the British Museum, was, it\r\nwill be remembered, successful in rendering such services to Admiral\r\nNelson, by his influence with the court of Naples, where he resided\r\nas British ambassador, that our naval hero was enabled to refit and\r\nvictual his fleet entirely, without losing the time which would have\r\nbeen sacrificed in returning to England, and thus contributed in a\r\nmarked degree to assist Nelson in surprising the French fleet in\r\nAboukir Bay, resulting in the famous victory of the Nile, which first\r\nchecked the tide of Napoleon's career, crippled the power of France,\r\nand finally compelled the armies of the Republic to withdraw from\r\nEgypt. Lady Hamilton's exertions with the Queen of Naples, over whom\r\nshe had gained considerable ascendency, were not without their national\r\nimportance, although her services were entirely ignored in the lady's\r\nlast days, at a time when the Government left her without that future\r\nprovision which Nelson, in falling fighting in his country's cause,\r\nand bequeathing her claims as a legacy to the nation, imagined he was\r\nsecuring for the support of his friend, who, it is reported, died in\r\nabject poverty, if she did not perish of actual want, as it has been\r\nhinted. In Rowlandson's drawing, Lady Hamilton, in classic garb, is\r\nwatering a plant placed in a classic vase; ancient busts, candelabra,\r\nand urns are standing about; the furniture, implements, and accessories\r\nare all fashioned after the antique. The caricaturist has taken certain\r\nfreedoms with the person of the Neapolitan ambassador, and Sir William\r\nis travestied as a stout personage, suffering from the gout. Another\r\nfemale figure, also draped after the antique, is touching a lyre, and\r\nchanting certain ditties of her own composition; this lady represents\r\nMiss Cornelia Knight (an authoress of some repute in her day, whose\r\nsmall notoriety rests on her _Continuation of Rasselas_, and her\r\n_Private Life of the Romans_)[27] who travelled in the suite of the\r\nambassador with his lady.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LADY HAMILTON AT HOME.]\r\n\r\nA familiar description of Lady Hamilton and her party occurs in a diary\r\nby Mrs. Colonel St. George, written during her sojourn among the German\r\ncourts, 1799 and 1800, and privately printed. The traveller happened to\r\nbe stopping in Dresden in October 1800, when Lord Nelson, Sir William\r\nHamilton, Lady Hamilton, her mother Mrs. Cadogan, and the poetess\r\narrived, and were received by Mr. Elliot, the English ambassador.\r\n\r\nThe portrait of Lady Hamilton is firmly drawn. Mrs. St. George thus\r\ndescribes the famous 'Emma,' of whose features so many admirable\r\npaintings exist limned by the hand of Romney. 'Her figure is colossal,\r\nbut, excepting her feet, well shaped. Her bones are large, and she\r\nis exceedingly _embonpoint_. She resembles the bust of Ariadne: the\r\nshape of all her features is fine, as is the form of her head, and\r\nparticularly her ears; her teeth are a little irregular, but tolerably\r\nwhite; her eyes light blue, with a brown spot in one, which, though\r\na defect, takes nothing away from their beauty and expression. Her\r\neyebrows and hair are dark, and her complexion coarse. Her expression\r\nis strongly marked, variable, and interesting; her movements in common\r\nlife ungraceful; her voice loud yet not disagreeable. Sir William is\r\nold, infirm, all admiration of his wife, and never spoke to-day but to\r\napplaud her. Miss Cornelia Knight seems the decided flatterer of the\r\ntwo, and never opens her mouth but to show forth their praise; and Mrs.\r\nCadogan, Lady Hamilton's mother, is what one might expect. After dinner\r\nwe had several songs in honour of Lord Nelson, written by Miss Knight,\r\nand sung by Lady Hamilton. She puffs the incense full in his face, but\r\nhe receives it with pleasure, and sniffs it up very cordially.\r\n\r\n'_October 7._--Breakfasted with Lady Hamilton, and saw her represent\r\nin succession the best statues and paintings extant. She assumes their\r\nattitude, expression, and drapery, with great facility, swiftness, and\r\naccuracy. Several Indian shawls, a chair, some antique vases, a wreath\r\nof roses, a tamborine, and a few children are her whole apparatus. She\r\nstands at one end of the room with a strong light on her left, and\r\nevery other window closed. Her hair is short, dressed like an antique,\r\nand her gown a simple calico chemise, very easy, with loose sleeves to\r\nthe wrists. She disposes of the shawls so as to form Grecian, Turkish,\r\nand other drapery, as well as a variety of turbans. Her arrangement\r\nof the turbans is absolutely sleight-of-hand, she does it so quickly,\r\nso easily, and so well. It is a beautiful performance, amusing to the\r\nmost ignorant, and highly interesting to the lovers of art. The chief\r\nof her imitations are from the antique. Each representation lasts about\r\nten minutes. It is remarkable that, coarse and ungraceful in common\r\nlife, she becomes highly graceful, and even beautiful, during this\r\nperformance. After showing her attitudes, she sang, and I accompanied.\r\nHer voice is good and very strong, but she is frequently out of tune;\r\nher expression strongly marked and various; but she has no flexibility,\r\nand no sweetness. She acts her songs.'\r\n\r\n1816. _Adventures of Johnny Newcome._ Republished.

Ackermann's,\r\n101 Strand.--A selection from Rowlandson's famous illustrations to\r\nthe _Dance of Death_; an ingenious series, quite suited, in spite\r\nof the grimness of the performance, to the artist's humour. The\r\npublication secured great praise during the designer's lifetime; in\r\npoint of execution the set leaves nothing to be desired; in regard\r\nto picturesque action and easy grouping, the illustrations will bear\r\ncomparison with any of the artist's works. As in the well-known series\r\nby Holbein, Della Bella, &c., Death appears at the most unexpected\r\nand inopportune moments, with that stern and ghastly reminder of the\r\nfutility of human pleasures, successes, and pursuits, of which the most\r\nplayful satirists have never been able to lose sight.\r\n\r\nDeath, in Rowlandson's series, displays his acknowledged ubiquity;\r\nhe knocks without ceremony at everyone's portal, and none can deny\r\nhim admission. Both artist and author seem to have appreciated the\r\nresources of their subject so thoroughly, and have worked out its\r\ngrotesque spirit with such appropriateness, that the _Dance of Death_\r\nmust remain a fitting monument of their genius. A large circulation\r\ncould hardly be anticipated for a work conceived in this realistically\r\nfearful vein. Rowlandson has drawn the various episodes which his\r\ninvention suggested with a completeness of detail rarely found in\r\nhis later designs, and the plates are executed with the fulness and\r\nattention of finished drawings; the figures are delineated with power\r\nand spirit, and the backgrounds are most delicate and suggestive.\r\nThe impressions are also coloured by hand with a judicious eye to\r\neffect and harmony. Combe has worked with a vigour worthy of the\r\noccasion; and for wit, point, and felicity we are inclined to believe\r\nthe versification to the _Dance of Death_ surpasses all his other\r\ncontributions to literature in this branch. The entire series may be\r\naccepted as a work of higher character, in all respects, than its\r\npopular predecessors, the better recognised _Tours of Doctor Syntax_;\r\nand it is superior, beyond comparison, to the works which followed it.\r\n\r\n    THE ENGLISH DANCE OF DEATH.\r\n\r\n    FROM THE DESIGNS OF THOMAS ROWLANDSON.\r\n\r\n    _With Metrical Illustrations by the Author of 'Doctor Syntax.'_\r\n\r\n    LONDON: PUBLISHED AT R. ACKERMANN'S REPOSITORY OF ARTS.\r\n\r\n    Pallida Mors æquo pulsat pede pauperum tabernas\r\n      Regúmque turres.--Hor. lib. i. od. 4.\r\n\r\n      With equal pace, impartial Fate\r\n    Knocks at the palace, as the Cottage Gate.\r\n\r\nThis series was begun in 1814, and finished in 1816; being issued from\r\nthe Repository of Arts in monthly parts, like the _Tour of Doctor\r\nSyntax_ and successive works.\r\n\r\nThe circumstances of its publication are set forth by 'the anonymous\r\nauthor' (William Combe) in one of his brief explanatory 'introductions.'\r\n\r\n'_The Dance of Death_ is a subject so well known to have employed the\r\ntalents of distinguished painters in the age of superstition, that\r\nlittle is required to recall it to the recollection of the antiquary,\r\nthe lover of the arts, and the artist.\r\n\r\n'Holbein is more particularly recorded as having employed his pencil\r\nupon a work of this kind; but, without entering into a detail of those\r\nmasters who have treated the subject of the _Dance of Death_, the\r\npresent object is merely to attract the public attention to the subject\r\nitself. Few remains are now visible of the original paintings which\r\nrepresented it, but they have been perpetuated by the more durable\r\nskill of the engraver, and the volumes which contain them in the\r\nlatter form are to be found on the shelves of the learned and curious\r\ncollector. The subject is the same in them all, but varied according to\r\nthe fancy of the painters, or perhaps from local circumstances attached\r\nto the places which they were respectively intended to decorate. The\r\npredominant feature is, without exception, the representation of one\r\nor more skeletons, sometimes indeed in grotesque attitudes, and with\r\nrather a comic effect, conducting persons of all ranks, conditions, and\r\nages to the tomb.\r\n\r\n'Mr. Rowlandson had contemplated the subject with the view of applying\r\nit exclusively to the manners, customs, and character of this country.\r\nHis pencil has accordingly produced the designs, which, in the\r\norder they were delivered to me, I have accompanied with metrical\r\nillustrations, a mode of proceeding which has been sanctioned by the\r\nsuccess of our joint labours in the _Tour of Doctor Syntax_. The\r\nfirst volume, therefore, of the English _Dance of Death_, which has\r\nappeared in twelve successive numbers, is now presented to the public\r\nin a collected form. The second volume will follow in the same mode\r\nof publication. Though the name and tenour of the work is borrowed,\r\nit may, perhaps, be allowed some claim to local and characteristic\r\noriginality. The most serious subject attached to our nature is,\r\nindeed, presented with a degree of familiar pleasantry which is not\r\ncommon to it. But in this particular the example of the painters who\r\nfirst suggested and propagated the idea has been followed, and no other\r\nvivacity has been displayed in these pages than has been found on the\r\nwalls of edifices dedicated to religion, and was thus represented\r\nin the cloisters of St. Paul's, before the sacrilegious pride of\r\nthe Protector Somerset caused the dilapidation of that appendage\r\nto the metropolitan church of the kingdom. But I am not afraid of\r\nbeing accused by reflecting minds of having introduced an unbecoming\r\nlevity into the following pages, for that writer may surely claim the\r\napprobation of the grave and the good who familiarises the mind with\r\nDeath by connecting it in any way with the various situations and\r\ncircumstances of life.\r\n\r\n                                                          'THE AUTHOR.'\r\n\r\nThe _Frontispiece_ represents the grim form of the spectral foe, his\r\nskeleton frame calmly seated on the globe, his grim jaw resting on his\r\narm, and his elbow on his knees; at his feet is the hourglass he has\r\nborrowed from Time; he wears the crown, which indicates his universal\r\nsovereignty, and in his grasp is the dart which must touch all humanity\r\nin turn, and speed them hence. A pipe and tabor are suspended overhead,\r\nand bats are flitting above. Round the effigy of destruction are\r\nstrewn the means wherewith his ends are wrought. A portly register,\r\n'_Death's Dance_,' is open; beside it are the symbolical instruments\r\nof his decrees--pistols, bullets, daggers, guns, dice, cards, the\r\nexecutioner's axe, a barrel of gunpowder, compounds, drugs, opium,\r\narsenic, mercury, and the various fatal agencies arrayed against the\r\nnatural preservation of life.\r\n\r\nA vignette on the engraved _Title-page_ further elucidates the uses of\r\nDeath's pipe and tabor. The grim King is enjoying himself in his own\r\nfashion, dancing his rattling bones right merrily to his own music,\r\nwhich he is congenially piping forth in a cemetery; while the fatal\r\nhourglass and dart are laid aside upon the slab of a grave. Death's\r\ngrim legions, the skeleton messengers of his decrees, are dancing\r\nfantastic figures with fiendish gaiety among the tombstones, performing\r\nghastly quadrilles sufficient to scare an involuntary beholder out of\r\nhis senses.\r\n\r\nPlate 1. _Time and Death._\r\n\r\n    Time and Death their thoughts impart,\r\n    On works of Learning and of Art.\r\n\r\nThe first scene, which we presume is simply introductory, and that\r\nDeath and his comrade, old Time, have dropped in unprofessionally or as\r\ncritics, represents two youthful students of the past. The apartment\r\nis surrounded with shelves, loaded with piles of busts and figures\r\nof the illustrious dead, the effigies of renowned poets, generals,\r\nphilosophers, statesmen, and all classes of the community, from the\r\nearliest times, being presented indiscriminately. From these memorials\r\nthe artist is sketching the portrait of a departed worthy. A literary\r\ngentleman, of a somewhat conventional type, with an open collar, a\r\nflowing dressing-gown, slippers, and general easy looseness of attire,\r\nhaving papers before him, and various manuscripts and ponderous volumes\r\nscattered around, is about, with a flourish of his quill, to record his\r\nimpressions of the past; old Father Time, with his bald crown, and grey\r\nbeard and spectacles on nose, is leaning on his scythe; while the grim\r\nKing of Terrors is grinning by his side, curiously peering over the\r\nshoulders of the unconscious workers, and suggesting--\r\n\r\n    The time-worn burden of the song\r\n    That Life is short--but Art is long.\r\n\r\nPlate 2. _The Antiquarian and Death._\r\n\r\n    Fungus, at length, contrives to get\r\n    Death's Dart into his Cabinet.\r\n\r\nThe second plate introduces us to the apartment of an elderly\r\nantiquary, who, nightcap on head, is propped up on his couch, with\r\nlearned tomes littered around him, trying to peer into the pages,\r\nwith the light of a candle held in a gilt sconce. The chamber of the\r\ninvalid is surrounded by trophies and relics, and apparatus implying a\r\ndiversity of tastes, and the means of humouring them. Suits of armour,\r\nsuits of costume, weapons, busts, ancient plate, musical instruments,\r\nvases, urns, idols, &c., are mixed up with sketches, folios of\r\nprints, palettes, books, architectural instruments, mortars, retorts,\r\nchemicals, and other appliances. A bull-dog is chasing rats, which\r\nare invading these richly lumbered domains. Wine, and a flask of vain\r\n'elixir,' are at the antiquary's elbow; but his candle is flickering,\r\nand he is already sinking into stupefaction, while the grim King of\r\nTerrors,--to the horrent affright of a cat perched on the invalid's\r\nbed,--has stealthily stolen into the chamber; and the last unique\r\ncuriosity, '_Death's dart_,' is about to become the property of the\r\nsemi-conscious collector.\r\n\r\nPlate 3. _The Last Chase._\r\n\r\n    Such mortal sport the chase attends.\r\n    At Break-neck Hill the hunting ends.\r\n\r\nThe chase is a stag, the dogs have just run the noble beast down; the\r\nhunters are making alarming efforts to come in 'at the death,' and\r\naccordingly they are piloted by the grim hunter in person, mounted on a\r\nskeleton steed, over the edge of a cliff which they perceive too late.\r\nThe frightened horses rear and plunge, and dash themselves and their\r\nriders headlong to destruction.\r\n\r\n    DEATH follow'd on his courser pale,\r\n    Up the steep hill, or through the dale:\r\n    But, 'till the fatal hour drew nigh,\r\n    He veil'd himself from ev'ry eye.\r\n    'Twas then his horrid shape appear'd,\r\n    And his shrill voice the hunters heard:\r\n    With his fell dart he points the way,\r\n    Til' astonish'd hunters all obey;\r\n    Nor can they stop the courser's speed,\r\n    Nor can they shun the deadly deed;\r\n    But follow with impetuous force,\r\n    The potent phantom's mortal course,\r\n    Down the steep cliff--the Chase is o'er--\r\n    The hunters fall--to rise no more!\r\n\r\n           *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    Still fate pursues--still mortals fly,\r\n    The chase continues till they die.\r\n    Howe'er they live, where'er they fall,\r\n    DEATH--MIGHTY HUNTER--earths them all!\r\n\r\nPlate 4. _The Statesman._\r\n\r\n    Not all the statesman's power, or art,\r\n    Can turn aside Death's certain dart.\r\n\r\nDeath, according to another picture, has asserted his supremacy in the\r\npresence of that very exalted personage, a statesman--whose table,\r\ncovered with deeds and bags of money, and whose office, attended by\r\nnumerous suitors, bearing heavy contributions, seem to indicate that\r\nthe owner has not failed to provide for himself. The portrait of Midas\r\ntops the book-case. A footman is pouring out a glass of wine for\r\nthe great man's refreshment, when the Universal Ruler, the 'King of\r\nTerrors,' who in this instance, out of respect possibly to the object\r\nof his call, has assumed his crown--is peering forth on the pair from\r\nbehind a screen; the ghastly summons has driven the colour from the\r\ncheeks of his victim, and drawn the power from his limbs.\r\n\r\nPlate 5. _Tom Higgins._\r\n\r\n    His blood is stopp'd in ev'ry vein,\r\n    He ne'er will eat or drink again.\r\n\r\nThe story of Tom Higgins is instructive. He began life as a\r\nbricklayer's lad, rose gradually, by care and industry, to a position\r\nof influence, and then turned his means to account.\r\n\r\n    A more important line he sought;\r\n    Houses he jointly built, and bought;\r\n    Nay, he had somehow learn'd to waste\r\n    The gay man's wealth in works of taste.\r\n\r\nAfter a life devoted to various building schemes and other\r\nspeculations, whereby Tom Higgins has grown into a man of great estate,\r\nhe is persuaded to become a squire, and to retire to the country,\r\nwhere his new position and state of being fail to afford him the\r\ngratification he had anticipated, and he sighs for the simple joys\r\nof his early days. Coombe's easy verses best describe the artist's\r\npicture, in which the end of wealth and consequence is graphically set\r\nforth, when Death finally drops in and discovers a passive and not\r\nunwilling victim in Tom Higgins.\r\n\r\n    At length, wheel'd forth in easy chair,\r\n    His sole delight was to repair\r\n    To a small, shaded inn, that stood\r\n    Contiguous to the turnpike-road:\r\n    There he could eat, and drink, and smoke,\r\n    And with the merry curate joke:\r\n    For though so chang'd in form and feature,\r\n    He still retain'd his pleasant nature:\r\n    And, as he took his brimming glass,\r\n    Was pleas'd to see the coaches pass:\r\n    Nor did he hesitate to own\r\n    He envied those who went to town,\r\n    And long'd to be at Islington.\r\n    'Nay, there I'll go once more,' he said,\r\n    'But that won't be till I am dead:\r\n    For wheresoe'er fat Tom shall die,\r\n    At Islington his bones shall lie.\r\n    There, where, when I was young and poor,\r\n    I smok'd my pipe at ale-house door;\r\n    And now, nor can I Fortune blame,\r\n    When old and rich, I do the same;\r\n    And all the good that pass'd between,\r\n    Will be as if it ne'er had been.\r\n    But still, I trust, whene'er it ends,\r\n    Death and Tom Higgins will be friends.'\r\n    He spoke, and straight a gentle sleep\r\n    Did o'er his yielding senses creep.\r\n    The pipe's last ling'ring whiff was o'er,\r\n    The hand could hold the tube no more;\r\n    It fell, unheeded, on the floor.\r\n    Death then appear'd, with gentle tread;\r\n    Just show'd his dart, and whisp'ring said,\r\n    'Spirits, to your protection take him:\r\n    For nothing in this world can wake him.'\r\n\r\nPlate 6. _The Shipwreck._\r\n\r\n    The dangers of the ocean o'er\r\n    Death wrecks the sailors on the shore.\r\n\r\nThe good ship is sunk in the deep; all is lost; a few fragments\r\nof a longboat are thrown upon the beach; the coast is rocky and\r\ninaccessible; two exhausted and starving mariners, the remnant of the\r\ncrew, are the sole survivors, and they have only escaped the dangers\r\nof the deep to face a more lingering fate from exposure and want. They\r\nare cast down without strength to assist themselves, or encouragement\r\nto prolong their miserable existence. Seated on a rock before them,\r\nconfronting their blank, hopeless, starved faces, sits the grim foe,\r\nfrom whose clutches by sea they have barely escaped. Death in this case\r\nis merciful, for he is welcomed as the deliverer. Cries Joe:\r\n\r\n    'Come, Death, and ease me of my pain,\r\n    Oh plunge me in the stormy main:\r\n    Hear my last prayer, and be my friend:\r\n    Thus let my life and suff'rings end!'\r\n        He spoke; and lo! before him sat\r\n    The summon'd messenger of fate.\r\n    'Ah! thou art there (the seaman said),\r\n    I know thee well--but who's afraid?\r\n    I fear'd thee not, when, at my gun,\r\n    I've seen the mischief thou hast done!\r\n    Upon the deck, from helm to prow,\r\n    Nor, old one, do I fear thee now;\r\n    But yield me in thy friendly power,\r\n    And welcome this my final hour.'\r\n        Death wav'd his arm:--with furious shock,\r\n    The billows dash'd against the rock!\r\n    Then, with returning force, they bore\r\n    The helpless victims from the shore:\r\n    There sinking, 'neath the foaming wave--\r\n    The sailors found--the SAILOR'S GRAVE.\r\n\r\nPlate 7. _The Virago._\r\n\r\n    Her tongue and temper to subdue\r\n    Can only be performed by you.\r\n\r\nDeath is shown, in another plate, as the advocate of peace. It is\r\nnight, and roysterers are staggering home, assisted by friends, or\r\nplundered by the harpies of darkness, according to their fortune. The\r\nwatch is calling the hour, when good souls should sleep in peace. A\r\nfury of an old wife, kicking, fuming, and tearing, is considerately\r\ntaken in hand by Death, the most effective tranquillising agent; her\r\nhusband is bowing and lighting his reviling spouse, and her trusty\r\nkeeper, to the door, while she is vainly screaming for the assistance\r\nof the watch. Her departure is viewed with rejoicing.\r\n\r\n    Her husband follow'd to the gate\r\n    Submissive to the will of fate.\r\n    'Farewell (he cried), my dearest dear!\r\n    As I no more shall see you here,\r\n    To my fond wish it may be given\r\n    That we may meet again in Heaven;\r\n    And since your daily clamours cease,\r\n    On earth I hope to live in peace.\r\n    Death, far away, my cares has carried.\r\n    _Molly,--to-morrow we'll be married!_'\r\n\r\nPlate 8. _The Glutton._\r\n\r\n    What, do these sav'ry meats delight you?\r\n    Begone, and stay till I invite you.\r\n\r\nA well-to-do gourmand has taken his place at a plentifully supplied\r\ntable, whereon is spread all kinds of fare; attendants are ministering\r\nto his wants, and a handsome and elegantly dressed female is at his\r\nside; the arch-jester, Death, has suddenly dropped into a vacant\r\narm-chair at the festive board; joints are scattered, plates are thrown\r\ndown, the founder of the feast is starting forward in consternation;\r\na male cook, and serving maids, bringing in fresh dishes, are losing\r\ntheir grasp of delicacies which will never, as it now appears, regale\r\nthe gluttony of their master. The foot of the ghastly skeleton has\r\ntouched an over-fed spaniel, and the dog lies stiff. Death is politely\r\nhanding forth his hourglass like a goblet, wherein to pledge his host,\r\nand enjoying a cruel pleasantry at the expense of the master of the\r\nhouse.\r\n\r\n    When the knight thought 'twere best be civil,\r\n    And hold a candle to the devil,\r\n    'Do lay that ugly dart aside;\r\n    A knife and fork shall be supplied;\r\n    Come, change your glass for one of mine,\r\n    That shall appear brimfull of wine;\r\n    Perhaps you're hungry, and may feel\r\n    A hankering to make a meal,\r\n    So without compliment or words,\r\n    Partake of what the house affords.'\r\n    'Avaunt,' cried Death, 'no more ado;\r\n    I'm come to make a _meal_ of _you_!'\r\n\r\nPlate 9. _The Recruit._\r\n\r\n    I list you, and you'll soon be found\r\n    One of my regiment under ground.\r\n\r\nA party of farm labourers, wearing bunches of ribands in their caps,\r\nare being recruited for the wars; they are led by a drummer, with\r\nwhose steps they are clumsily attempting to keep time. One fine, tall,\r\nhealthy-looking young fellow is taking leave of his sweetheart;\r\nhis father, mother, and the rest of his family and friends, grouped\r\naround--down to a grotesque-looking dog--are plunged into grief at his\r\ndeparture. Death, who is wearing a plumed hat, a jaunty cloak, and\r\nwho carries his dart like a halbert, is clutching the shoulder of the\r\nrecruit, and hurrying forward his legions; the universal captain is\r\nreminding his followers of the everlasting burden--_Death_ and _Glory_.\r\n\r\nPlate 10. _The Maiden Ladies._\r\n\r\n    Be not alarm'd, I'm only come\r\n    To choose a wife, and light her home.\r\n\r\nDeath, with an air of awful gallantry, wearing a gay cap, rakishly set\r\non one side of his grim bare skull, with his dart put up guitar-wise,\r\nand laying a bony hand on the part of his structure where his heart\r\nshould be, has arrived, unannounced, with a lantern to offer the\r\ncourtesies of his escort to a large gathering of elderly spinsters--a\r\n'tabby party' of weird and wizened-looking ancient anatomies--who are\r\nmet for the joint distractions of scandal and gambling. The cards,\r\nthe stakes, and the play-table are capsized; a fat footman is gazing\r\nwith wonder at the guest last arrived, but the old maids are sensible\r\nof the nature of his attentions, and they are fluttering about in\r\nconsternation and terror, as to whose turn has come. Death, it seems,\r\nis making a jest of offering what these frozen old maids have lacked\r\nthrough life--a husband.\r\n\r\n    'Tis Fate commands, and I with pride,\r\n    Embrace Miss _Mustard_ as my bride.\r\n    A well-appointed hearse-and-four,\r\n    Attends her pleasure at the door.\r\n    The marriage ceremonies wait\r\n    Her presence at the churchyard gate:\r\n    My lantern shines with nuptial light;\r\n    The bells in muffled peal invite;\r\n    And she shall be--_A bride to-night_.\r\n\r\nPlate 11. _The Quack Doctor._\r\n\r\n    I have a secret art to cure\r\n    Each malady which men endure.\r\n\r\nApothecaries' Hall, it might reasonably be hinted by the satirists,\r\nwas a likely spot for Death's visitations. In Rowlandson's print we\r\nfind the grim foe in the full exercise of his privileges, pounding away\r\nwith fatal energy. An apothecary is dispensing various noxious drugs\r\nto a considerable crowd of patients, who are disfigured by various\r\nsufferings. They will not be kept waiting long apparently, for behind a\r\ncurtain, Death, grinning at himself with a satisfied air in a mirror,\r\nand surrounded by the seeds of mortality, is grinding slow poisons with\r\na will; the motive power of the situation; as an able assistant to the\r\nquacks, whose master he knows himself to be.\r\n\r\nPlate 12. _The Sot._\r\n\r\n    Drunk and alive, the man was thine,\r\n    But dead and drunk, why--he is mine.\r\n\r\nVeteran topers are soaking at the sign of _The Goat_ on the village\r\ngreen; they are bloated and gouty, but convivial and careless. The\r\nlandlord is looking somewhat horrified to find one of his best and most\r\nunwieldy customers carried off by his enraged and scolding wife, for\r\nwhose assistance Death has himself brought a wheelbarrow in which to\r\ncart away her incapable spouse, and in reply to the railings of the\r\nvixen the grim death's-head is comically wagging his nether jaw, and\r\nlogically stating his just claim to this burden of well-saturated clay.\r\n\r\nPlate 13. _The Honeymoon._\r\n\r\n    When the old fool has drunk his wine\r\n    And gone to rest,--I will be thine.\r\n\r\nA wealthy old dotard, already half in the grave, has committed the\r\nlast supreme folly of decrepitude, and married a young, beautiful,\r\nand blooming maid, whose troth and affections are plighted in advance\r\nto a more suitable but less prosperous suitor. The artist has drawn\r\nthe enjoyments of the honeymoon; the imbecile and antiquated 'happy\r\nman,' nightcap on head, is plunged in an invalid chair; a well-stuffed\r\ncushion gives ease to his gouty extremities; a table at his side\r\nis spread with a costly dessert service. The palsied hands of the\r\nvenerable idiot are vainly striving to steady a goblet for a bumper;\r\nthe eager toper does not distinguish the hand which is filling his last\r\nglass. The grim skeleton, Death, stooping over a screen, is supplying\r\nthe final dose from his own fatal decanter. The blushing fair, who has\r\nbeen trying to soothe the gouty torments of her superannuated spouse\r\nwith music and poetry, is awakened to the sound of a window opening at\r\nher back, her name is pronounced; 'tis the gallant and dashing young\r\nofficer, the man of her choice. Nothing abashed, and without disturbing\r\nher attitude beside the invalid, or turning her head, her rounded arm\r\nand taper hand are leant over the casement by way of encouragement to\r\nher lover, who is availing himself of the opportunity and is embracing\r\nher fingers.\r\n\r\n    Think me not false, for I am true:\r\n    Nay, frown not--yes,--to Love and you.\r\n    Reason and int'rest told me both,\r\n    To this old man to plight my troth.\r\n    I had but little--you had less;\r\n    No brilliant view of happiness:\r\n    And though, within the lowest cot,\r\n    I would have shar'd your humble lot,\r\n    Yet, when the means I could possess\r\n    Which would our future union bless,\r\n    I gave my hand, th' allotted price,\r\n    And made myself the sacrifice.\r\n    When I was to the altar led,\r\n    Age and decrepitude to wed,\r\n    The old man's wealth seduc'd me there,\r\n    Which gen'rous Hymen bid me share;\r\n    And all, within a month or two,\r\n    I hope, brave boy, to give to you.\r\n    Behold, and see the stroke of Fate\r\n    Suspended o'er my palsied mate:\r\n    For Death, who fills his goblet high,\r\n    Tells him to drink it, and to die.\r\n    And now, my Henry dear, depart\r\n    With this assurance from my heart.\r\n    I married him, by Heaven, 'tis true,\r\n    With all his riches in my view,\r\n    TO SEE HIM DIE--AND MARRY YOU.\r\n\r\nPlate 14. _The Fox Hunter Unkennelled._\r\n\r\n    Yes, Nimrod, you may look aghast.\r\n    I have unkennel'd you at last.\r\n\r\nA party of fox-hunters, getting ready to start for the chase, are\r\nrefreshing themselves from substantial joints, and potent stirrup-cups.\r\nDeath, the grim hunter, uninvited and unannounced, has joined the\r\nparty, to the consternation of both men and dogs; one disconcerted\r\nNimrod, in palsied affright, has vainly sought concealment under the\r\ntable; Death, with true sportsman's instinct, is raising the cloth, and\r\nsimultaneously striking the refugee, 'run to cover,' with his weapon.\r\n\r\n    While Jack, as quick as he was able,\r\n    Sunk, slyly, underneath the table.\r\n    The phantom drew the drap'ry back,\r\n    And, in a trice, unkennell'd Jack:\r\n    When, after crying Tally-ho!--\r\n    He pois'd his dart and gave the blow:\r\n    Then told his friends to shove Jack Rover\r\n    Into the hearse which he leap'd over.\r\n\r\nOne or two prints of the series are not treated from a grotesquely\r\nhorrible point of view.\r\n\r\nPlate 15. _The Good Man, Death, and the Doctor._\r\n\r\n    No scene so blest in virtue's eyes,\r\n    As when the man of virtue dies.\r\n\r\nIn this picture the artist has been at the pains to illustrate,\r\nwithout travesty, the end of a good man, stretched stiff on his last\r\ncouch. By the side of his bed kneel various members of his family,\r\nplunged into the deepest affliction; at the head of the bed stands\r\na benevolent-visaged pastor of the church, who has evidently just\r\nadministered the last consolations of religion to the departed. The\r\nburlesque element, which does not interfere with the main group of the\r\nsketch, is settled on the action of Death, who, emblematic as usual, is\r\nthrusting before him an evil-looking and overfed quackish practitioner,\r\nthe extortionate physician, who has boldly declared 'he has no time\r\nfor praying, but demands his honorarium.' The arch foe has fixed his\r\nunrelaxing grip upon the shoulder of Doctor Bolus, who it may be\r\npresumed has received his last fee.\r\n\r\nPlate 16. _Death and the Portrait._\r\n\r\n    Nature and Truth are not at strife,\r\n    Death draws his pictures after life.\r\n\r\nA gouty and decrepit corpulent sitter is propped up by cushions and\r\npillows in an arm-chair placed on a raised stage in a painter's studio.\r\nFrom the canvas it appears that the original of this last act of vanity\r\nis a judge. The sitter has evidently reached a state of dotage, and\r\nthe artist has left his slumbering subject to enjoy a more congenial\r\noccupation; he is showing a blushing young damsel, who has accompanied\r\nthe gout-ridden old judge, certain designs, groups of cupids, and the\r\nyoung couple have seemingly established a very agreeable understanding.\r\nDeath has fantastically perched himself in the artist's seat, and\r\nhaving assumed his brush and palette, is putting the finishing touches\r\nboth to portrait and sitter.\r\n\r\n    The painter brings the promis'd aid,\r\n    And views the change that has been made.\r\n    He sees the picture's altered state,\r\n    And owns the master-hand of Fate.\r\n    'But, why,' he cries, 'should artists grieve\r\n    When models die,--if _pictures_ live?'\r\n\r\nPlate 17. _The Genealogist._\r\n\r\n    On that illumin'd roll of fame\r\n    Death waits to write your lordship's name.\r\n\r\nIn the escutcheon-panelled ancestral hall of the peer, surrounded by\r\nthe evidences of antiquity and wealthy ease, the sepulchral visitor,\r\nunbidden, lays down his hourglass, and is shown displaying to the\r\naffrighted gaze of a fashionably apparelled old couple, the family\r\ngenealogical table which he has taken the liberty of unrolling for an\r\nunexpected addition he is about to make.\r\n\r\n    On that illumined roll of fame\r\n    Death waits to write your lordship's name.\r\n    Whether from Priam you descend,\r\n    Or your dad cried--_Old chairs to mend_,\r\n    When you are summon'd to your end,\r\n    You will not shun the fatal blow;\r\n    And sure you're old enough to know,\r\n    That though each varying pedigree\r\n    Begins with _Time_, it ends with _me_!\r\n\r\nPlate 18. _The Catchpole._\r\n\r\n    The catchpole need not fear a jail,\r\n    The undertaker is his bail.\r\n\r\nA bailiff is serving a writ outside the Debtors' Prison, the barred\r\nwindows of which are filled with the faces of persons captured by one\r\n_Catchpole, Sheriff's Officer_. The unfortunate prisoners, crowded\r\nbehind the bars of their jail, are enjoying a grim instance of\r\nretributive justice. While the bailiff is startling his victim with\r\nhis unexpected capture-bespeaking tap, Death, dart in hand, is lightly\r\nperforming the same ceremony for the stalwart sheriffs officer, who is\r\nsummoned in his turn, and conclusively.\r\n\r\n    Thus, as he told his stern command,\r\n    A grisly spectre's fleshless hand\r\n    His shoulder touch'd. It chill'd his blood,\r\n    And at the sight he trembling stood.\r\n    'You long have ow'd,' the Phantom said,\r\n    'What now must instantly be paid.'\r\n    'O give me time!' 'Thou caitiff dun,\r\n    You know full well you gave _him_ none.\r\n    Your life's the debt that I am suing;\r\n    'Tis the last process, Master Bruin.'\r\n    'I'll put in bail above.' 'No, no:\r\n    OLD NICK shall be your BAIL BELOW.'\r\n\r\nPlate 19. _The Insurance Office._\r\n\r\n    Insure his life, but to your sorrow\r\n    You'll pay a good round sum to-morrow.\r\n\r\nA country squire, in the prime of life, has married a young bride; he\r\nis persuaded by his frugal spouse to insure his life as a provision for\r\nher maintenance, from prudential reasons. As the young wife sensibly\r\nstates the case:--\r\n\r\n    Nature, in all her freaks and fun,\r\n    Has never given us a son;\r\n    And there's no jointure, sir, for me\r\n    Without that same contingency.\r\n    For your estate's so bound and tied,\r\n    So settled and transmogrified,\r\n    (A thing one scarcely can believe)\r\n    You've not a thousand pounds to leave.\r\n\r\nThe artist has represented the couple arrived in town, and visiting\r\nthe insurance office, the 'Globe,' or 'Pelican;' the actuary, the\r\nsecretary, and the doctor are there to pass the customer's life, and\r\nDeath--spectacles on nose and dart in hand--is also one of the party;\r\nunperceived, he is stooping down behind the seemingly robust applicant,\r\nand gloating over the mischievous prank he has in contemplation.\r\n\r\n    To this the doctor sage agreed,\r\n    The office then was duly fee'd,\r\n    And sign'd and seal'd each formal deed.\r\n    Now Death, who sometimes loves to wait\r\n    At an insurance office gate,\r\n    To baffle the accountant's skill\r\n    And mock the calculating quill,\r\n    Had just prepar'd his cunning dart\r\n    To pierce _Ned Freeman's_ tranquil heart:\r\n    But lest the stroke should cause dispute,\r\n    And lawyers conjure up a suit,\r\n    Death was determined to delay\r\n    _Ned's_ exit to a future day;\r\n    And the dull moment to amuse,\r\n    He turn'd and kill'd a pair of Jews.\r\n    Thus was the husband's life insur'd,\r\n    And the wife's future wealth secur'd.\r\n    But _Death_ had not forgot his fiat,\r\n    So bid a fever set him quiet;\r\n    And ere, alas, ten days were past,\r\n    Honest Ned Freeman breath'd his last.\r\n    The doctor call'd to certify\r\n    His glowing health now saw him die.\r\n    Thus she who lately came to town\r\n    With not a doit that was her own,\r\n    Weeping attends her husband's hearse,\r\n    With many a thousand in her purse,\r\n    And proves that she's of wives the best\r\n    Who knows her _real interest_.\r\n\r\nPlate 20. _The Schoolmaster._\r\n\r\n    Death with his dart proceeds to flog\r\n    Th' astonished, flogging pedagogue.\r\n\r\nThe learned schoolmaster, whose years have reached a respectable\r\nlongevity, is surprised in the midst of his tasks, while training\r\nthe minds of the youths around him, to discover the grim skeleton\r\nDeath, _mors pulsat_, concerning whose approach he is well stored\r\nwith classic instances, seated astride of the terrestrial globe, to\r\nthe consternation of the scared and flying scholars. The well-read\r\npedagogue is inclined to give his visitor a lesson from Horace in good\r\nmanners.\r\n\r\n    That he at least should knock, and wait\r\n    Till some one opes th' unwilling gate.\r\n\r\nTo which Death retorts in reply:--\r\n\r\n    Doctor, this dart will neither speak\r\n    In Hebrew, Latin, or in Greek,\r\n    But has a certain language known\r\n    In ev'ry age as in our own.\r\n\r\nThe pale spectre proceeds to remind his charge of the prolonged\r\nallowance of life which has been allotted to the pedagogue, although\r\nhe finds his years have proved too short to allow him to complete the\r\nlegacy of learning it was his fond ambition to leave behind him.\r\n\r\nThe doctor, who seems a kindly preceptor, and one whose self-composure\r\nit is difficult to disturb, while resigning his mind to his own fate,\r\nis interceding for his pupils.\r\n\r\n    'But you'll at least these urchins spare,\r\n    They are my last, my only care.'\r\n    'I'll hurt them not, I'll only scare 'em:\r\n    So die, and _Mors est finis rerum_,\r\n    Which, for your scholars, I'll translate,\r\n    Death strikes the learn'd, the little, and the great!'\r\n\r\nPlate 21. _The Coquette._\r\n\r\n    I'll lead you to the splendid crowd:\r\n    But your next dress will be a shroud.\r\n\r\nA dashing belle, of majestic presence--according to Rowlandson's\r\ndesign--is standing before a toilette table which is elegantly fitted;\r\nher costume is just completed, and her tire-woman is holding a light\r\nwrapper, when, in spite of the exertions made by a duenna to restrain\r\nhis brusque invasion, an unexpected intruder is gliding into the\r\nhandsome chamber. Bowing with the extreme of mock politeness, Death\r\nhas come as cavalier to escort the lady, who was preparing for a\r\nmasquerade; his hourglass and dart are slung by his side, he sports a\r\nfashionable powdered wig, with a solitaire, a red coat, a cocked hat,\r\ndandified pumps, and a frill, which he is fingering with the air of a\r\n_petit maître_. According to Coombe's verses, we learn that Flavia, a\r\nyoung lady of _ton_, whose sister is but recently dead, cannot resist\r\nthe temptation to cast off her mourning for one evening, and apparel\r\nherself as the 'Queen of Beauty,' to appear at midnight at Lady Mary's\r\nball.\r\n\r\n    But, as her lovely form receiv'd\r\n    The robe which Fashion's hand had weav'd,\r\n    A shape appear'd of such a mien\r\n    As Flavia's eyes had never seen.\r\n    'How dare you enter here,' she said,\r\n    'And what's this saucy masquerade?\r\n    Who are you? Betty, ring the bell.'\r\n    The Shape replied--''Twill be your knell.\r\n    I'll save you from the swelt'ring crowd,\r\n    Form'd by the vain, the gay, the proud,\r\n    For which your tawdry mind prepares\r\n    Its fruitless, its coquettish airs.\r\n    Lady, you now must quit your home\r\n    For the cool grotto of a tomb.\r\n    Be not dismay'd; my gallant dart\r\n    Will ease the flutt'rings of your heart.'\r\n    He grinn'd a smile; the jav'lin flies,\r\n    When Betty screams--and Flavia dies!\r\n\r\nPlate 22. _Time, Death, and Goody Barton. A Causette._\r\n\r\n    On with your dead, and I'll contrive\r\n    To bury this old fool alive.\r\n\r\nOld Time, armed with his scythe, is driving his mortuary cart through\r\na village; the horse is a mere skeleton, but the vehicle is heavily\r\nloaded, humanity is heaped up like carcases of no account, in fact\r\nthe melancholy receptacle is as full as it will hold, and the wheel\r\nis passing over the neck of a frightened cur. Death is acting as\r\ncollector, and has picked up one of the plagues of the village, a\r\ntroublesome old man, who is kicking, fighting, and protesting against\r\nthe violent illegality of Death's treatment in throwing his lot amongst\r\nthe defunct. Stern Time, on the box, is turning round to remonstrate\r\nwith his assistant.\r\n\r\n    _Time._\r\n\r\n    While he shows that living face,\r\n    With me he cannot have a place.\r\n\r\n    _Death._\r\n\r\n    'Tis true the fellow makes a riot:\r\n    There's one jerk more--and now he's quiet.\r\n\r\nA young wife, who has a soldier-lad in attendance waiting for the shoes\r\nof her old husband, is dragging forth an ancient cripple, and pushing\r\nhim on against his will:--\r\n\r\n    _Death._\r\n\r\n    My goody, 'tis too late to-day,\r\n    Time's moving on, and will not stay;\r\n    But be at rest and save your sorrow,\r\n    The cart will call again to-morrow.\r\n\r\nPlate 23. _The Undertaker and the Quack._\r\n\r\n    The doctor's sick'ning toil to close,\r\n    'Recipe coffin' is the dose.\r\n\r\nA prosperous quack practitioner, meditating over his specific\r\n_sovereign pill to cure all ills_, is riding gravely through the\r\nstreets of a picturesque country town. As his hack is passing\r\nScrewtight the undertaker's window, that worthy is thrown into\r\nconsternation, for he recognises, immovably perched behind the\r\ncogitating empiric, the figure of a grim rider with whose presence he\r\nis too professionally familiar to be deceived.\r\n\r\n    And leaping on the doctor's hack,\r\n    Sat close and snugly at his back;\r\n    And as they reach'd Ned Screwtight's door,\r\n    Death sneez'd--and Nostrum was no more.\r\n\r\nThe undertaker is plunged into sincere mourning for the loss of his\r\ngreat patron; his less far-seeing wife declares he ought to rejoice at\r\nhis good fortune, since there's the job of burying the deceased doctor.\r\n\r\n    Screwtight hung down his head and sigh'd:\r\n    'You foolish woman,' he replied,\r\n    'Old Nostrum there stretch'd on the ground\r\n    Was the best friend I ever found.\r\n    The good man lies upon his back,\r\n    And trade will now be very slack.\r\n    How shall we undertakers thrive,\r\n    With doctors who keep folks alive?\r\n    You talk of jobs; I swear 'tis true,\r\n    I'd sooner do the job for you.\r\n    We've cause to grieve, say what you will,\r\n    For when quacks die, they cease to kill.'\r\n\r\nPlate 24. _The Masquerade._\r\n\r\n    Such is the power and such the strife\r\n    That ends the masquerade of life.\r\n\r\nA masked ball is represented at its height, gaily attended, and held in\r\nthe Pantheon or some similar building. A dance is proceeding; the most\r\ndiversified scenes meet the eye on all sides, and Rowlandson has given\r\nfull play to his humorous inventive faculties. In the front of the\r\npicture the crowd of merrymakers, all unthinking and unprepared, are\r\nhorrified to discover a new turn abruptly given to the travesty; the\r\ntall figure of Death has suddenly cast away his disguising domino, and\r\nholding aside a demoniac mask, is revealing to the terrified spectators\r\nthe actual figure of the skeleton-destroyer, armed with his dart, and\r\nin grim earnest to strike. Harlequins, nuns, monks, devils, Turks,\r\ntoxopholites, bacchantes, jockeys, Punch, Falstaff, Jupiter, Ophelia,\r\nFriar Tuck, watchmen, magicians, fair enchantresses and Circassians,\r\narchbishops, Roman heroes, and Grand Signiors--characters in vogue in\r\nRowlandson's day--are thrown down pell-mell and trampling one over\r\nthe other in their eagerness to get as far away as possible from this\r\nunwelcome and awful addition to the excitement of the revelry; this\r\nghastly joker who with unequivocal reality is threatening to extinguish\r\ntheir gaieties for ever.\r\n\r\nPlate 25. _The Deathblow_.\r\n\r\n    How vain are all your triumphs past,\r\n    For this set-to will be your last.\r\n\r\nTwo prize-fighters have met on Epsom Downs to decide the championship\r\nof the 'Ring,' with umpires, bottle-holders, and all the paraphernalia\r\nof the 'fancy.' In the artist's picture one of the combatants has\r\nreceived a fatal blow, and he is stretched lifeless on the turf. The\r\ngrim figure of Death, the bony personification which permeates the\r\nseries, has suddenly joined the sport, and he is squaring up to the\r\nscared victor in a scientific and confident attitude; the horrified\r\nchampion is unconsciously raising his strong arms to guard himself\r\nagainst this new opponent, though justly disinclined to continue such\r\nan unequal contest. Impressed by the fatal ending of the man he has\r\nbeaten the winner has conscientiously registered a vow, on the spur of\r\nthe moment, 'to never fight again.'\r\n\r\n    But Death appear'd! Once more, my friend,\r\n    Yes, one round more, and all will end.\r\n\r\nThe crowds of fashionable and sporting spectators are all dispersing at\r\nthe top of their speed, running and driving away from this unexpected\r\nopponent, and turning their backs on this involuntary renewal of their\r\nfavourite diversion.\r\n\r\n    Confusion reign'd throughout the scene,\r\n    And the crowds hurried from the Green.\r\n    The roads were quickly covered o'er\r\n    With chaise and pair and chaise and four,\r\n    While curricles and gigs display\r\n    The rapid fury of their way,\r\n    And many a downfall grac'd the day.\r\n    As _Playgame_ claim'd a flying bet,\r\n    His new-built tilb'ry was o'erset:\r\n    Lord Gammon's barouche met its fate\r\n    In contact with a turnpike-gate;\r\n    And _Ned Fly's_ gig, that hurried after,\r\n    Was plung'd into a pond of water.\r\n    But, would it not be vain to tell\r\n    The various chances that befel\r\n    Horsemen and footmen who that day\r\n    From _Death's_ dread challenge ran away?\r\n    For when th' affrighted crowd was gone,\r\n    And DEATH and HARRY were alone,\r\n    The spectre hasten'd to propose\r\n    That they should forthwith come to blows;\r\n    But Harry thought it right to say,\r\n    'As no one's here to see fair play,\r\n    I'll try your strength another day.\r\n    Besides, I know not how you're made,\r\n    I look for substance, you're a Shade,\r\n    A bag of bones; for aught I know,\r\n    Old _Broughton_, from the shades below:\r\n    And though alive I should not dread\r\n    His power, I war not with the dead.'\r\n    Thus keeping well his guard he spoke,\r\n    When grinning Death put in a stroke\r\n    Which did the short-liv'd round decide,\r\n    And _Sheffield Harry_, in his pride,\r\n    Was laid by _Tom from London's_ side.\r\n\r\nPlate 26. _The Vision of Skulls. (In the Catacombs.)_\r\n\r\n    As it appears, though dead so long,\r\n    Each skull is found to have a tongue.\r\n\r\nA party of the fashionably curious are carrying their taste for\r\nsight-seeing down into the catacombs, and the fragments of decaying\r\nhumanity are lighted up for their ghastly entertainment. In the\r\ninstance designed by Rowlandson the visitors are lost in horror at\r\nthe spectacle of the grinning human skulls arranged in trim arcades;\r\nthey do not notice the person of their conductor, who is more fearful\r\nto look upon than the relics around. Death himself, dart in hand, is\r\ncondescending to act as showman to the gallery of his own furnishing;\r\nthe torch he holds is whirled aloft in his grisly left arm, in an\r\ninstant it will be flung into a well of water, which the holiday-makers\r\nhave not distinguished; darkness must succeed, and many of the\r\nspectators may follow the flambeau or lose their way in terror-striking\r\nand fearful labyrinths which extend for leagues under the city.\r\n\r\nPlate 27. _The Porter's Chair._\r\n\r\n    What watchful care the portal keeps!\r\n    A porter he who never sleeps.\r\n\r\nSeated snugly in the hall-porter's easy-chair before the handsome\r\nmantel and cheerful fire in the marble-paved hall of a nobleman's\r\nmansion, with its statues and embellishments telling of ease, taste,\r\nand profusion, is our old friend the grim hero of the series. He is\r\nwaiting quite tranquilly, impatience is foreign to his impassive\r\ntemperament; his hourglass is on the ground at his side; his\r\ndart is held negligently, but in readiness; a nocturnal bird is\r\nhovering suggestively over his fleshless head; he has supplanted the\r\nnight-porter, and is probably sitting there attending the return of the\r\nunprepared owner of these rich surroundings. Some sound has alarmed the\r\nservants; the butler has stolen down in his nightcap, armed with sword\r\nand pistol; he is collapsed with terror, and his defences are dropping\r\nfrom his hand on making the discovery that Death has established\r\nhimself in the hall; and the fat cook, who is also paralysed with\r\nhorror, has taken a false step, and is falling giddily down the\r\nstaircase, whence her head will come in violent contact with the marble\r\nfloor; and Death without turning in his seat may confidently count upon\r\none victim in advance.\r\n\r\n    For at the time Death's pleas'd to come,\r\n    We all of us must be at home.\r\n\r\nPlate 28. _The Pantomime._\r\n\r\n    Behold the signal of Old Time,\r\n    That bids you close your pantomime.\r\n\r\nA pantomimic scene is transpiring; according to the artist's picture,\r\nit is the very last place where Death's ghastly impersonation could\r\nbe considered a diverting addition to the company. The background\r\nrepresents the sea-shore; Columbine, supported on the arm of Harlequin,\r\nis pirouetting and posturing in amorous poses; the other personages\r\nof the mimic theatre are thrown into actions which are entirely\r\nunpremeditated, while their countenances wear expressions which supply\r\nghastly contrasts to their motley. Death once more has intruded his\r\nbony person on the stage, the inevitable dart is held slily behind him,\r\nand in the painted and terror-stricken faces of Pierrot and Pantaloon\r\nthe tale-telling hourglass is held up, the sand has run through, and\r\nthe mummers must away hence. The stage wizard is stretched at length on\r\nhis back, and his wonder-working magic sword is mere lath and tinsel\r\nbefore the weapon of this grim supernatural actor, who has come,\r\nunengaged, to give a new turn to the show.\r\n\r\n    Thus may Death's image aid delight,\r\n    'Mid the gay scen'ry of the night:\r\n    But in the pantomime of years,\r\n    'Tis serious all when Death appears.\r\n    For then no grin can Pierrot save;\r\n    He finds the trap a real grave;\r\n    Old Pantaloon, with all his care,\r\n    Will cease to be an actor there;\r\n    _Lun's_ magic sword, with all its art,\r\n    Must yield to Fate's resistless dart,\r\n    And when life's closing scene is o'er,\r\n    The curtain falls to rise no more.\r\n\r\nPlate 29. _The Horse Race._\r\n\r\n    This is a very break-neck heat;\r\n    And, squire jockey, you are beat.\r\n\r\nThe artist has pictured a race-course; in the distance the grand stand,\r\na group of tents, and crowds of equestrians and equipages may be\r\ndistinguished. A file of race-horses, with their jockeys and trainers,\r\nare being walked up to the starting point. A crowd of mounted 'sporting\r\ngents,' the _élite_ of the patrons of the turf, are assembled round the\r\n'betting post,' shouting the odds and eagerly making their engagements\r\nbefore the approaching start. Nearer the spectator is displayed some\r\nof the fun of the course, which never failed to strike Rowlandson's\r\neye. An old dame has a table and an arrow, at which sundry juvenile\r\nrustics are gambling for cakes, and a Jew pedlar is tossing with two\r\nsportive urchins for nuts. The _Dead Heat_ referred to in Coombe's\r\nlines is shown in the person of an anxious country squire, who, afraid\r\nof arriving at the betting post too late to speculate, is pushing his\r\nhorse along madly to arrive in time, without noticing a skeleton steed,\r\nneck and neck with his own, whose jockey is the inevitable skeleton,\r\n_Mors_, wearing a gay cap and feather, and turning his dart to account\r\nas a riding-whip.\r\n\r\n    Now Jack was making to the post,\r\n    The busy scene of won and lost,\r\n    When to all those he saw around,\r\n    He cried, 'I offer fifty pound,\r\n    That to yon gambling place I get\r\n    Before you all.' Death took the bet.\r\n    The squire's mare was _Merry Joan_,\r\n    And Death rode _Scrambling Skeleton_.\r\n    They started, nor much time was lost\r\n    Before they reach'd the gambling host:\r\n    But ere they reach'd the betting pole,\r\n    Which was the terminating goal,\r\n    O'er a blind fiddler _Joan_ came down,\r\n    With fatal force poor Jack was thrown,\r\n    When a stone on the verdure laid\r\n    Prov'd harder than the rider's head.\r\n    Death way'd aloft his dart and fled.\r\n\r\nPlate 30. _The Dram-Shop._\r\n\r\n    Some find their death by sword and bullet,\r\n    And some by fluids down the gullet.\r\n\r\nDeath is discovered nefariously at work adulterating the spirit-casks\r\nwith vitriol and aquafortis.\r\n\r\nPlate 31. _The Gaming-Table._\r\n\r\n    Whene'er Death plays, he's sure to win!\r\n    He'll take each knowing gamester in.\r\n\r\nDeath, the successful player, is shown stripping the table of the\r\nstakes and breaking the bank by force.\r\n\r\n    But Death, who, as he roams about,\r\n    May find the _Gaming Table_ out;\r\n\r\n           *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    He enters; when the fearful shout\r\n    Echoes around of 'turn him out.'\r\n    'No,' he replies, 'that gold is mine:\r\n    Gamester, that gold you must resign.\r\n    Now life's the main,' the spectre cries:\r\n    He throws, and lo! the gamester dies.\r\n\r\nPlate 32. _The Battle._\r\n\r\n    Such is, alas, the common story\r\n    Of blood and wounds, of death and glory.\r\n\r\nDeath is engaged in serving a battery which is sweeping all before it.\r\n\r\nPlate 33. _The Wedding._\r\n\r\n    Plutus commands, and to the arms\r\n    Of doting age she yields her charms.\r\n\r\nDeath, with a wig, bands, and gown, is within the altar railings\r\nperforming the marriage service with an air of mocking reverence; the\r\nactors in the marriage ceremony do not appear to have recognised the\r\ndread personage who is tying the nuptial knot, to be instantly cut\r\nasunder by the end of the effete bridegroom.\r\n\r\nPlate 34. _The Skaters._\r\n\r\n    On the frail ice, the whirring skate\r\n    Becomes an instrument of fate.\r\n\r\nThe scene represents one of the parks, the waters are frozen over and\r\ncrowded with pleasure-seekers of both sexes indulging their amusement\r\nin the teeth of danger--nay, as it appears in the picture, in the very\r\njaws of death. The skeleton foe is taking his pastime amongst the\r\ncrowd, and combining relaxation with business. The ice is suddenly\r\ngiving way in all directions, and the skaters are tripped up by the\r\ngrim evolutionist. They are falling headlong into the water, fatal\r\ncasualties are occurring on all sides, and the distant crowds, who are\r\nscrambling away incontinently since the arch-enemy has volunteered to\r\nshare their pastime, are coming into violent collision, and falling on\r\nthe ice, breaking their limbs or suffering fatal concussions.\r\n\r\nPlate 35. _The Duel._\r\n\r\n    Here honour, as it is the mode,\r\n    To Death consigns the weighty load.\r\n\r\nNowhere could Death's presence be more suitably manifested than on the\r\nfield of honour; and, as the artist has pictured the situation, the\r\nparties are met to settle some trifling dispute; seconds and surgeons\r\nare naturally in attendance. Death is promptly dashing in and dragging\r\noff a stout combatant in the prime of life, who, having just received\r\nhis quietus, is caught in the arms of the omniscient and universal\r\nantagonist before his falling body can touch his mother earth.\r\n\r\nPlate 36. _The Bishop and Death._\r\n\r\n    Though I may yield my forfeit breath,\r\n    The Word of Life defies thee, Death.\r\n\r\nThe artist, with that talent which distinguished him above his\r\ncontemporaries, has concluded the first volume of the _Dance of Death_\r\nwith a nobler design; an occasion is presented with deeper purpose\r\nwherein Death is shorn of the majesty of terror. A venerable bishop,\r\nseated in a handsome Gothic apartment of the episcopal palace, with\r\nthe Book of Life open before him, and his chaplain in attendance, is\r\nreceiving an abrupt visitation from the ghastly spectre. The difficulty\r\nof frightening the reverend victim, whose mind seems well prepared for\r\nthe end, however premature, has made Death put himself somewhat out\r\nof the way to appear sensationally startling; his grim humour seems\r\nto have been laid aside for once, and he is weakly seeking effect in\r\na theatrical pose, striking a stagey attitude, poising his weapon,\r\nand holding on high his warning hourglass. The whole impression is\r\nadmirably conveyed. The Destroyer's posture is pretentious without\r\nbeing imposing; he has missed his point; this bombastical terrorism\r\nhas nothing of the terrific left in it, and Death looks somewhat\r\ndisappointed on failing to produce more consternation. The bishop is\r\ncalmly receiving his turbulent visitor, with an air which seems to\r\ndemand, without perturbation: 'O Death, where is thy sting? O grave,\r\nwhere is thy victory?'\r\n\r\n\r\n    THE ENGLISH DANCE OF DEATH.\r\n\r\n    SECOND VOLUME.\r\n\r\nPlate 1. _The Suicide._\r\n\r\n    Death smiles, and seems his dart to hide,\r\n    When he beholds the suicide.\r\n\r\nUpon a rock-bound shore, whose jagged boulders come down to the deep,\r\ndashes a troubled sea, the waters of which are settling down after a\r\ntempest. Upon the foam floats the form of a drowned man; above is seen\r\nthe figure of a female, forlorn and reckless, who has come to meet her\r\nfuture husband, and finds only his corpse--his life lost in a valiant\r\neffort to succour a sinking fellow-creature from a wreck.\r\n\r\n    The tidings to the bride were brought,\r\n    In frantic haste the spot she sought,\r\n    And viewing from the heights above\r\n    All that remain'd for her to love,\r\n    She darted headlong to the tide,\r\n    And on her Henry's bosom died.\r\n\r\nDeath is present at this moving scene, lolling at his ease on the rock\r\nfrom whence the maiden is plunging; his dart is affectedly put aside,\r\nand he is pretending to wipe away a sentimental tear.\r\n\r\nPlate 2. _Champagne, Sherry, and Water-Gruel._\r\n\r\n    Have patience, Death, nor be so cruel\r\n    To spoil the sick man's water-gruel.\r\n\r\nThe verses intended to illustrate this picture of Death's visitations\r\ncontain an argument between three friends on the best means of\r\nregulating their lives; the artist has worked out this theory in his\r\nplate. One member of the party assembled, a stout florid old gentleman,\r\ndeclares his golden rule in life has been to please himself, so he\r\nand his daughter are illustrating his text by drinking full bumpers\r\nof champagne; beside him, sipping his thimblefuls of sherry, is\r\nanother theorist, who has passed his days in moderate indulgences.\r\nIn an invalid chair beside the fire sits their host, a vaporous\r\nhypochondriac, who has passed his existence in humouring imaginary\r\nills on a diet of sago and doctor's stuff. His nurse is preparing a\r\nsaucepan of gruel, which the _Mortis Imago_, as his convivial friend\r\nhas christened him, is preferring to more exhilarating beverages.\r\nDeath has stepped in and settled the question as to which of these old\r\nschoolfellows shall last the longest; he has placed his bony hand on\r\nthe shoulder of the great patron of doctors, and before departing with\r\nhis 'meagre meal' he is giving the friends, who are allowed to survive\r\nfor the time being, this piece of gratuitous advice if they would put\r\noff his visits as long as possible:--\r\n\r\n    Extremes endeavour to forego,\r\n    Nor feed too high, nor feed too low.\r\n\r\nPlate 3. _The Nursery._\r\n\r\n    Death rocks the cradle: life is o'er:\r\n    The infant sleeps, to wake no more.\r\n\r\nThis picture may be designated a warning to fashionable mothers. A\r\nfine infant has been 'put out to nurse;' it is evident that the child\r\nwould have been better at home. The 'foster mother' is a coarse sloven,\r\nand has neglected her charge for her self-indulgence. The natural\r\nparent, a handsome young woman, dressed in the height of the mode, and\r\naccompanied by friends of quality, has yielded to a sudden impulse to\r\npay a visit to her offspring. The door of the cottage is opened, and\r\nthis is what meets the horrified eyes of the party. The nurse sunk in\r\na drunken sleep, her head on a cushion, another cushion at her feet, a\r\nflagon of spirits at her elbow and a glass in her hand, and a starved\r\ncat on her chair; the infant's food upset on the floor, the apartment\r\nneglected, a clothes-line and damp linen stretched over the infant's\r\nhead, and Death sitting by, grotesquely rocking the cradle, and singing\r\nhis mortal lullaby.\r\n\r\n    No shrieks, no cries will now its slumbers break,\r\n    The infant sleeps,--ah, never to awake!\r\n\r\nPlate 4. _The Astronomer._\r\n\r\n    Why, I was looking at the Bear:\r\n    But what strange planet see I there!\r\n\r\nThe astronomer, who from his surroundings would also seem a student\r\nof miscellaneous sciences, is seated in his observatory, deep in the\r\ncontemplation of the planets. Grim Death has called to summon the\r\n'learned Senex' hence, and he is playing his victim a final prank.\r\n\r\n    One evening, as he view'd the sky\r\n    Through his best tube with curious eye,\r\n    And 'mid the azure wilds of air\r\n    Pursu'd the progress of a star,\r\n    A figure seem'd to intervene,\r\n    Which in the sky he ne'er had seen,\r\n    But thought it some new planet given,\r\n    To dignify his views of heaven.\r\n    'Oh, this will be a precious boon!\r\n    Herschel's volcanoes in the Moon\r\n    Are nought to this,' old Senex said;\r\n    'My fortune is for ever made.'\r\n    'It is, indeed,' a voice replied:\r\n    The old man heard it, terrified;\r\n    And as Fear threw him to the ground,\r\n    Through the long tube Death gave the wound.\r\n\r\nPlate 5. _The Father of the Family._\r\n\r\n    The doctors say that you're my booty;\r\n    Come, sir, for I must do my duty.\r\n\r\nDeath, in this picture, has rather a hard tussle for it. His friends,\r\nthe learned physicians, who are pocketing their fees, and turning their\r\nbacks on their late patient, are hurrying away. Death, with a great\r\nshow of force, has seized his victim, still in the pride of manhood,\r\nby the dressing-gown, and is seeking to drag him from the frantic\r\nembraces of those to whom his life is dear. The father and mother are\r\nremonstrating with this merciless abductor; the blooming wife and\r\ninfants of the unfortunate are cast down in despair; his sisters have\r\nseized him boldly round the waist, and, one behind the other, are\r\nmaking a sturdy stand against the fatal messenger; the servants and all\r\nthe inmates of the noble mansion have rushed out, and are endeavouring\r\nby their entreaties, or by a show of resistance, to stay the steps of\r\nthe tyrant.\r\n\r\nPlate 6. _The Fall of Four-in-Hand._\r\n\r\n    Death can contrive to strike his blows\r\n    By overturns and overthrows.\r\n\r\nDeath has come again, in his irresistible shape, and he has found the\r\noccasion ready to his hand. A dashing charioteer, a man of wealth and\r\nfashion, with a gaily attired female by his side, is tearing along,\r\neager\r\n\r\n              to leave behind\r\n    The common coursers of the wind,\r\n    In more than phaetonic state,\r\n    For every horse had won a plate.\r\n\r\nBut on arriving at a low bridge, which spans a torrent, the blood\r\nhorses become unmanageable; the driver sighs for a 'tight postilion,'\r\nand behold on the 'leader' is seated one who will spur the whole team\r\nto destruction; the horses are sent over the narrow bridge, the tall\r\ncurricle is capsized, and eternity is instantly opened to the careless\r\npleasure-seekers.\r\n\r\nPlate 7. _Gaffer Goodman._\r\n\r\n    Another whiff, and all is o'er,\r\n    And Gaffer Goodman is no more.\r\n\r\nGaffer Goodman is a selfish sybarite, who has secured a charming\r\nrustic maiden for his wife, as being a proceeding more economical than\r\nengaging a nurse. The gaffer, whose existence is centred on creature\r\ncomforts, is seated in his huge easy-chair, under a row of goodly\r\nhams, a provision for the future, before his Brobdingnagian fireplace,\r\nwith a cosy nightcap, dressing-gown, and slippers for ease, meditating\r\nover the good things preparing for dinner, his beer jug ready to hand\r\nand warming, sunk in the tranquil enjoyment of his pipe. Another\r\nsmoker has, unperceived by the gaffer, planted himself by his side,\r\nburlesquing his enjoyment, and timing his whiffs to the final puff.\r\nThe neat and pretty wife, sacrificed to the selfishness of the old\r\nyeoman, is cheerfully spinning her flax at the open window, leaning\r\nthrough which the artist has introduced a well-favoured youth, her late\r\nsweetheart, discarded by necessity, but soon to be consoled, as the\r\nlady is assuring the lad of her heart.\r\n\r\n    'When I declare that I'll be true\r\n    To Gaffer Goodman, and to you:\r\n    And when he does his breath resign,\r\n    Be wise--and Strephon, I'll be thine.'\r\n    'Then take her, Strephon,' Death replied,\r\n    Who smoking sat by Goodman's side:\r\n    'Her husband's gone, as you may see,\r\n    For his last pipe he smok'd with me.'\r\n\r\nPlate 8. _The Urchin Robbers._\r\n\r\n    O the unconscionable brute!\r\n    To murder for a little fruit!\r\n\r\nThe plate represents a pretty, trimly kept garden, belonging to a\r\nmansion of some pretensions. A group of young marauders have been\r\nstripping the orchard. They are suddenly scared by the apparition\r\nof the gardener, whose person is disclosed over a bush beside his\r\ngreenhouses, where, gun in hand, he has been lying in ambush, to teach\r\nhis troublesome tormentors a lesson. Some of the marauders have gained\r\nthe wall, and are dragging up their comrades. Others are following,\r\nloaded with well-filled bags of plunder; a bigger lad is seized in the\r\nrear by the gardener's dog. The man has no deadly intentions, he merely\r\nwishes to frighten the urchins as a warning; but the grim figure is\r\nlurking undiscovered by his side; the musket is discharged, and to the\r\naffright of the custodian of the fruit, a youth falls lifeless to the\r\nground. 'Twas not his aim which had wrought this mischief; the whole\r\naffair was pre-arranged by his unperceived companion, with the most\r\nplausible motives, as Death himself confesses.\r\n\r\n    I drove the boy to scale the wall,\r\n    I made th' affrighted robber fall,\r\n    I plac'd beneath the pointed stone\r\n    That he had crack'd his skull upon.\r\n    I've been his best and guardian friend,\r\n    And sav'd him from a felon's end:\r\n    Scourging and lectures had been vain!\r\n    The rascal was a rogue in grain,\r\n    And, had I lengthen'd out his date,\r\n    The gallows would have been his fate.\r\n    You living people oft mistake me,\r\n    I'm not so cruel as you make me.\r\n\r\nPlate 9. _Death turned Pilot._\r\n\r\n    The fatal pilot grasps the helm,\r\n    And steers the crew to Pluto's realm.\r\n\r\nThe sea is in a tempest, and the wrecks of two good ships are battling\r\nwith the foaming waters. A number of unfortunate creatures are\r\nendeavouring to escape in a longboat, pulled by the rowers with the\r\nvigour of despair; but the struggle for life is cut short; grim Death\r\nhas taken his place in the stern, he is exultingly flourishing Time's\r\nhourglass before the horrified survivors, and wilfully steering the\r\nbark to destruction; the head of the boat is dipping beneath the waves,\r\nand a watery grave completes Death's handiwork.\r\n\r\nPlate 10. _The Winding-up of the Clock._\r\n\r\n    No one but me shall set my clock:\r\n    He set it, and behold the shock.\r\n\r\nThe picture represents a general scene of downfall. A stout clergyman\r\nhas obstinately insisted on his right to attend to his own timepiece\r\nover the chimney-glass. His fat body has lost its balance, the steps\r\nare overturned, the breakfast table and its equipage are brought to\r\nruin; the shock, aided by the sly hand of Death in ambush, has upset\r\nhis portly wife in her arm-chair, and a general destruction is hinted\r\nof persons and property alike.\r\n\r\nPlate 11. _The Family of Children._\r\n\r\n    'Twere well to spare me two or three\r\n    Out of your num'rous family.\r\n\r\nIn this plate we are introduced to a scene of extensive domestic\r\nfelicity; at a breakfast-table is seated the father of a numerous\r\nfamily, surrounded by fourteen pledges of conjugal affection; another\r\nchild is in a nurse's arms, and in the apartment beyond may be\r\nperceived the worthy and prolific partner of his joys, who has lately\r\npresented her husband with their sixteenth infant. Death proposes\r\nto take one or two of these children under his charge, but the good\r\nfather will not hear of it. 'Well then, let it be the infant,'\r\nproposes the greedy fiend. 'No, 'twould break the mother's heart!'\r\n'Whom shall I strike then?' Death demands. The benevolent parent can\r\nonly suggest 'the nurse.'\r\n\r\nPlate 12. _Death's Door._\r\n\r\n    In this world all our comfort's o'er,\r\n    So let us find it at Death's door.\r\n\r\nDeath's bony person is half thrust through his portals--which lead to\r\nthe grave--as he has been disturbed by a boisterous summons thundered\r\nat his gate. He seems quite shocked at the importunities of a crowd of\r\nunfortunates who are clamorous in their demands for instant admittance\r\nto the unknown realms. Madmen, the extremely aged, the gouty, the\r\nbereaved, those afflicted with poverty, disease, scolding wives,\r\nthe hungering, cripples, forsaken ones, and a multitude of various\r\nsufferers to whom the buffets of life have proved insupportable, are\r\nsupplicating refuge from an unkindly world.\r\n\r\nPlate 13. _The Fire._\r\n\r\n    Let him go on with all his rigs;\r\n    We're safe; he'll only burn the pigs.\r\n\r\nDeath in this plate is represented as a reckless incendiary; he is\r\nflourishing a brace of flaming torches, and is bent on doing all\r\nthe mischief within his power. A farmhouse is the object of his\r\ndestructiveness; the cattle are escaping, and the family, disturbed\r\nfrom their slumbers by fire, are huddled together with such articles\r\nas could be secured in a hurried flight when their own lives were\r\nendangered. The unfortunate pigs may count on being roasted, as nothing\r\ncan save the farm from the flames.\r\n\r\nPlate 14. _The Miser's End._\r\n\r\n    Old dad at length is grown so kind,\r\n    He dies, and leaves his wealth behind.\r\n\r\nThe miser is laid out prone, half-starved, his stiffening hands are\r\nstill grasping bonds, notes, and a bag of money; his body is propped up\r\nby a 'book of interest,' and he has died, without the ease of a bed, on\r\na mattress placed on the floor of his strong room. His iron boxes and\r\nmoney chests are opened by Death, who is leading the miser's delighted\r\nheirs into the treasure-chamber, where the bags of wealth, heaps of\r\ncoin, and files of securities have banished all remembrance of the\r\nmiserable corpse, lately the self-denying hoarder of these superfluous\r\nriches.\r\n\r\nPlate 15. _Gretna Green._\r\n\r\n    Love, spread your wings, I'll not outstrip 'em,\r\n    Though Death's behind, he will not clip 'em.\r\n\r\nA coach-and-four, driven by two postilions, is speeding off to\r\nScotland; it contains a fair ward, and a captain, her abductor. This\r\nhopeful pair are eloping to Gretna Green; the ward is escaping from the\r\nhouse of her old guardian, who had a desire to marry her himself for\r\nher wealth; the baffled and avaricious tyrant is riding his hardest to\r\novertake the fugitives, who are threatening him with pistols held out\r\nof either window. Death, mounted on a skeleton steed, is riding step\r\nfor step with the pursuer, whose horse will presently stumble, the\r\nchase will be over, and the greedy guardian's schemes will be abruptly\r\nbrought to an end.\r\n\r\nPlate 16. _The Waltz._\r\n\r\n    By Gar, that horrid, strange buffoon\r\n    Cannot keep time to any tune.\r\n\r\nA French dancing-master, while playing on the fiddle, is exercising\r\na pretty and graceful maiden in the dance; the professor is out of\r\ntemper with the fair pupil's partner, although the lady seems absorbed\r\nin the excitement of the motion. 'Tis Death waltzing his delicate\r\nvictim--entranced and unsuspicious--into a consumption, which will end\r\nin the churchyard.\r\n\r\nPlate 17. _Maternal Tenderness._\r\n\r\n    Thus it appears a pond of water\r\n    May prove an instrument of slaughter.\r\n\r\nThe picture in this instance represents a lake situated in a noble\r\npark. Two youths have been tempted to bathe; one is lifted out of the\r\nwater apparently lifeless. His mother, who has been alarmed by the\r\nintelligence of her son's danger, has just arrived, at the instant that\r\nthe seemingly dead body is borne to the bank. The sudden shock has\r\nproved too much for nature to withstand. The tender parent falls back\r\noverpowered and unconscious, and Death, with an air of solicitude, is\r\nready there to catch her falling form in his bony support, since she\r\nhas become his charge.\r\n\r\nPlate 18. _The Kitchen._\r\n\r\n    Thou slave to ev'ry gorging glutton,\r\n    I'll spit thee like a leg of mutton.\r\n\r\nWhile dinner is just prepared for my lord's table the stout _chef_ and\r\nhis attendant myrmidons are thrown into disorder by the appearance of\r\nan unwelcome intruder. Dishes are dropped, everything is forgotten but\r\npersonal security. The fat first male cook is the object of Death's\r\nattack, and the grim skeleton, armed with a long roasting spit, is\r\ntrampling over the fallen person of a frightened kitchen-maid, and is\r\nproceeding to impale the great _chef_, who is the only person present\r\nthat is making a stand against the assassin.\r\n\r\nPlate 19. _The Gig._\r\n\r\n    Away they go, in chaise and one,\r\n    Or to undo or be undone.\r\n\r\nA sporting tradesman, driving a highly spirited horse, is taking\r\nhis lady out for exercise on an excursion. Frightened by a dog, the\r\nmettlesome horse is dashing away distracted; another object, the figure\r\nof Death seated on a milestone, has completed the scare; the steed is\r\ntearing wildly towards the margin of a cliff which overhangs the sea;\r\nthe driver is trying to pull up, the reins snap, and he is dashed out\r\non his head, while his companion leaps off, to fall a corpse at the\r\nfeet of the grim figure perched on the milestone.\r\n\r\nPlate 20. _The Mausoleum._\r\n\r\n    Your crabbed dad is just gone home:\r\n    And now we look for joys to come.\r\n\r\nThe heroine of this adventure is an heiress who is loved by a certain\r\nlord, but in spite of the daughter's inclinations and the quality of\r\nthe suitor, the crabbed father will neither part with his child nor his\r\nwealth while he retains his place in life. This impediment is removed\r\nin the picture. While the unreasonable parent is hobbling on his\r\ncrutches into the entrance of a mausoleum, the door of which Death is\r\nassiduous to open for the reception of his expected visitor, the happy\r\ncouple, overjoyed, are walking, locked in a tender embrace, to his\r\nlordship's equipage, at the door of which two footmen are standing in\r\nreadiness, while the coachman is waiting to drive the delighted pair to\r\nbe married.\r\n\r\nPlate 21. _The Courtship._\r\n\r\n    It is in vain that you decide:\r\n    Death claims you as his destin'd bride.\r\n\r\nAnother fair heiress forms the subject of this fresh whim of Death's\r\nfancy. The lady is what the author terms a 'philosopher in love,' and\r\nshe cannot decide to quit her state of independence. A conclave of\r\nher suitors are assembled to argue the marriage question, and, by the\r\nmaiden's wish, to allow her a chance of judging by comparison. The\r\narray of aspirants is comprehensive; there is a colonel, a lawyer, a\r\nparson, a doctor, a quaker, and a baronet. Each pretender to her hand\r\nand fortune in turn argues the inducements he has to plead; this done,\r\nit rests with the lady to reply to the respective arguments and examine\r\ntheir motives. While logically disposing of all their fine persuasions,\r\nthe intractable fair is claimed by a suitor who will take no denial.\r\nThe reasoning of the arch-enemy is unanswerable:--\r\n\r\n    She is not fit, strange maid, to wed\r\n    With living wight, but with the dead:\r\n    I therefore seize her as my bride.\r\n    Belinda trembled, gasp'd, and died.\r\n\r\nPlate 22. _The Toastmaster._\r\n\r\n    'The end of life,' the chairman cries;\r\n    'Tis drank--and many a toper dies.\r\n\r\nA scene of gross intoxication is proceeding. A convivial company is\r\nassembled; the effort of every individual's ambition is apparently the\r\ndownfall of his neighbour by successive toasts; bowl succeeds bowl, and\r\nhalf the assembly are _hors de combat_. A new chairman has, uninvited,\r\ninstalled himself at the head of the table, and he is making the liquor\r\ncirculate with such hearty goodwill that the topers have received him,\r\nin spite of his repellant exterior, as one of themselves. Death has\r\nordered in fresh supplies of steaming punch, which he is ladling out\r\nto the fascinated tipplers; it is the final toast, and no one dares\r\nrefuse to pledge it. 'One bumper more,' and the jovial meeting will be\r\ndissolved for ever.\r\n\r\nPlate 23. _The Careless and the Careful._\r\n\r\n    The careful and the careless led\r\n    To join the living and the dead.\r\n\r\nThe picture introduces us to the gate of Vauxhall Gardens; the\r\nlight-hearted visitors are quitting the entertainment. The wise virgins\r\nare carefully wrapped up with cloaks, hoods, scarves, and muffs, and\r\nduly lighted home by cautious guardians carrying lanterns. In the\r\nforeground the foolish revellers are portrayed. They have left the\r\nheated dancing room in their light attire; a couple of giddy maidens,\r\nwho are too careless to wait for their coach, are skipping off into\r\nthe damp and chilling atmosphere without a wrapper, their thin\r\ndresses blowing in the wind, and running home under the escort of a\r\ngallant major. Death, with a jaunty cap on his head, and muffled in\r\na cloak which disguises his ghostly frame, is dancing before, a very\r\n'will-o'-the-wisp,' dangling about a flickering lantern, a dangerous\r\nguide whom they fail to recognise.\r\n\r\n    'Twas Death, alas, who lit them home,\r\n    And the fools' frolic seal'd their doom.\r\n\r\nPlate 24. _The Law Overthrown._\r\n\r\n    The serjeant's tongue will cease to brawl\r\n    In every court of yonder Hall.\r\n\r\nA busy lawyer, hastening away from Westminster Hall, where he has\r\nbeen exercising his lungs, has jumped into a chariot without noticing\r\nthe driver on the box-seat. In this case Death is officiating as\r\ncharioteer; he is whipping his horses with a vengeance. The serjeant's\r\ncoach is endangering the life of a brother counsel, a dog is running\r\nbetween the frightened barrister's legs, and his end seems imminent.\r\nDeath has chosen to wreck the carriage over a pile of stones and a\r\nheavily-loaded wheelbarrow which the paviours have left in the course\r\nof road-mending. The serjeant, brief in hand, is thrusting his angry\r\nface through the front of the capsizing vehicle, vehemently threatening\r\npenalties and vowing to bring an action against his coachman.\r\n\r\n    Fate to the stones his head applies;\r\n    The action's brought--the serjeant dies.\r\n\r\nPlate 25. _The Fortune-teller._\r\n\r\n    All fates he vow'd to him were known,\r\n    And yet he could not tell his own.\r\n\r\nIn this instance we are introduced to the 'chamber of mystery' of\r\na pretended fortune-teller. The empiric seer is surrounded by the\r\nparaphernalia of his profession; a crocodile is suspended to the\r\nceiling, above a mystic string of orbs, and the globes have an uncanny\r\nblack cat perched thereon, a witch at the least. Two credulous ladies\r\nof fashion have called to consult the pretentious impostor, who\r\nrejoices in the fur cap, flowing robes, long beard, and divining rod of\r\na magician; a book of nativities is open before him:--'To me all fates,\r\nall fortunes known;' to which Death retorts, in hollow voice: 'Vain\r\nboaster, tell your own.' A greater conjuror is present concealed behind\r\nMerlin's seat; a jerk, and the wizard is no longer above deception; he\r\nis overturned, his neck is broken amidst the wreck of his mummeries\r\nscattered around.\r\n\r\nPlate 26. _The Lottery Office._\r\n\r\n    To trust to fortune's smiles alone,\r\n    Is the high road to be undone.\r\n\r\nThe evil of permitting lotteries, which were still in existence and\r\nflourishing at the time this plate was projected, is set forth in\r\na graphic design. A crowd of needy adventurers have hurried to the\r\nlottery office, eager to know if fortune has assigned them lucky\r\nnumbers. Jews, misers, and all sorts of gamblers, including a mob of\r\nhardy rogues who have purloined their employers' property to tempt the\r\nsmiles of the fickle goddess, are darting from the office in dismay.\r\nAn unlucky female, who has ventured her all, and even risked the means\r\nand belongings of others on the chance of winning a prize, has come to\r\ninquire her fate. The grim foe has exultingly taken his place among the\r\nclerks; he is holding out two blanks with an air of fiendish malice,\r\nand the shock is proving a deathblow to the unfortunate fair gambler,\r\nshe is expiring in the office.\r\n\r\nPlate 27. _The Prisoner Discharged._\r\n\r\n    Death, without either bribe or fee,\r\n    Can set the hopeless pris'ner free.\r\n\r\nDeath in this case is still shown interfering with the course of\r\nothers' business. The picture represents a debtors' prison; a wife and\r\ntwo daughters have come to visit an unhappy captive, the head of the\r\nfamily, who is detained by a relentless creditor. They just arrive in\r\ntime to see their relative released beyond the resistance of mortal\r\ndetainers. The deadly foe has called at the gate, the prisoner is\r\nsummoned forth, warders and turnkeys dare not refuse to let him free\r\nin such company. A mortified Shylock and his disappointed lawyer are\r\nfuriously pointing to their bonds, and dancing with rage to find their\r\nends defeated by the grim joker, who is grinning at their manifest\r\ndiscomfiture.\r\n\r\n\r\nPlate 28. _The Gallants Downfall._\r\n\r\n    Th' assailant does not feel a wound,\r\n    But yet he dies--for he is drown'd.\r\n\r\nA military Don Juan is the unfortunate hero of this adventure. He loves\r\nthe beauteous daughter of a fire-eating superannuated colonel, Full of\r\nromantic gallantry, he has planted a ladder at his mistress's window,\r\nand is mounting nimbly where Cupid invites him, without observing the\r\ngrim figure which has hold of his scaling-ladder. The sturdy colonel,\r\nawakened by the unaccustomed and suspicious sounds in his grounds, has\r\nfired his evening gun into the darkness, at most expecting to startle\r\nthe cats. Death capsizes the ladder, the youthful lieutenant loses his\r\nbalance and falls headlong into a pond on the lawn, whence his body is\r\nfished out in the morning, to the surprise of the household.\r\n\r\nPlate 29. _The Churchyard Debate._\r\n\r\n    'Tis strange, but true, in this world's strife,\r\n    That Death affords the means of life.\r\n\r\nThe picture in this instance gives a philosophic view of the end of\r\nman, and represents a snug assembly of the fortunate individuals who\r\nprosper professionally by the influence of the grim foe's assistance.\r\nSeated convivially on tomb-slabs, awaiting the arrival of a hearse and\r\nmourning _cortége_, is the author of the mischief hobnobbing with his\r\nfriends and allies. Death and the doctor are blowing a cloud together\r\nin cheerful company, for the parson, the lawyer, and the sexton are\r\npleased with his society. The undertaker is no less grateful to his\r\nuseful patron, and even the distant bell-ringer acknowledges the value\r\nof his acquaintanceship.\r\n\r\nPlate 30. _The Good and Great._\r\n\r\n    What heartfelt tears bedew the dust\r\n    Of him whose ev'ry thought was just.\r\n\r\nThe funeral of a great and benevolent man is the subject of this\r\ncartoon. The venerable lord of the manor is dead; the stately funeral\r\nis setting out with its doleful attendants from the lordly hall. The\r\ncoffin, with its emblazoned pall, is followed by a long train of\r\nmourners, whose sorrow is sincere; Death is congenially employing\r\nhimself as bearer of the funeral plumes; and in this capacity, bending\r\nunder the melancholy feathers, he is taking the lead of the procession.\r\nThe tenants and villagers are standing uncovered as the body of their\r\nbest friend is borne past; aged and young alike are giving way to\r\nunaffected grief, and it is evident that they regret the loss of a\r\nrespected and kindly landlord, who has made himself loved by his\r\nneighbours.\r\n\r\nPlate 31. _The Next Heir._\r\n\r\n    'Tis not the time to meet one's fate,\r\n    Just ent'ring on a large estate.\r\n\r\nThe _Next Heir_ forms a pendant to the _Good and Great_, and exhibits\r\na picture the contrast of the foregoing. The nephew, a dashing London\r\nblade, has succeeded to the title and the estates. He is supposed to\r\narrive post haste at the mansion, which is still plunged in mourning\r\nfor the late owner. The pastor and the tenants are drawn up to receive\r\ntheir new master. The approach of the departed lord's successor is\r\nfilling their faces with dismay. The devil-may-care 'blood' is tearing\r\nup to the hall in a tandem, his followers are clothed in deep black,\r\nbut beyond this he displays no regard for the dead; his servants are\r\nclashing up on horseback, his huntsman is giving a blast of his horn,\r\nhis grooms are shouting 'Tally-ho!' and a pack of hounds are barking on\r\nall sides. Death is acting as postilion, and as this unthinking heir\r\ndrives up to the entrance-court his head is caught by the hatchment\r\nput up to the late lord, and his mad career is cut short at the very\r\nthreshold.\r\n\r\nPlate 32. _The Chamber War._\r\n\r\n    When doctors three the labour share,\r\n    No wonder Death attends them there.\r\n\r\nThe case of the invalid who forms the principal figure in the present\r\nsubject must indeed be a desperate one, since the doctors, after a\r\nwordy warfare disputing over the case of the patient and the proper\r\ntreatment, have come to blows in real earnest. Medicine bottles, and\r\nall the accessories of a sick chamber, are thrown to the ground, the\r\ntable is overturned, wigs are sent flying, and a regular scrimmage with\r\nfisticuffs is taking place. Four practitioners are cuffing one another\r\nin the presence of their victim, with professional energy, and the sick\r\nnurse is cutting in, attacking the shaven crowns indiscriminately with\r\nthe utensils which first come to hand. The sufferer is thrown into a\r\nmortal fright, but Death has very considerately called in to attend\r\nto his wants, and his disquietude will soon cease beyond the fear of a\r\nrelapse.\r\n\r\nPlate 33. _Death and the Antiquaries._\r\n\r\n    Death, jealous of his right, stands sentry\r\n    Over the strange burglarious entry.\r\n\r\nA party of ardent archæologists are holding a meeting in the abbey.\r\nThey have obtained permission to open a royal grave, and the sexton has\r\nperformed his part, and raised the slab of the vault in which the body\r\nof a king has reposed undisturbed for centuries. The coffin is raised,\r\nthe lid removed, and the corpse, with its regal trappings, is laid open\r\nto their inspection. Full of enthusiasm, the antiquaries are clustering\r\nround the coffin in crowds, eager to get a sight of the decaying\r\nmonarch. Nor do they heed the risk they run, for Death, jealous of this\r\ninterference with his rights, is prepared to resent their intrusion;\r\nand, mounted on an adjacent tomb, he is about to plunge his dart into\r\nthe thickest of the learned throng.\r\n\r\nPlate 34. _The Dainty Dish._\r\n\r\n    This fine hot feast's a preparation\r\n    To some for Death's last cold collation.\r\n\r\nA sumptuous feast is represented: the handsome dining-room is filled\r\nwith voracious guests; footmen are waiting on the diners, or attending\r\nto side tables; butlers are drawing corks, course is following course,\r\nthe cook and his assistant train are hurrying in with fresh dishes.\r\nAmong the waiters, undetected, is our friend the grisly skeleton, who\r\nis busying himself with a dish he is conveying to the table. It is\r\nthe favourite delicacy of the corpulent host, and he has expressed a\r\ndesire for 'just one slice more' of his esteemed dainty. The grim foe\r\nis determined to take the entertainer at his word, and that 'one slice\r\nmore' will be his last indulgence.\r\n\r\nPlate 35. _The Last Stage._\r\n\r\n    From hour to hour, from youth to age,\r\n    Life's traveller takes th' uncertain stage.\r\n\r\nThe sketch in this suggestive plate introduces us to the court-yard\r\nof the _Dolphin Inn_, a famous posting-house. The life to be found\r\nin these coach-yards was attractive material to our artist, and he\r\nhas delineated with rare skill all the bustle and preparation of a\r\ndeparture. The coach is 'braced' up, the horses are put-to, the guard\r\nand his 'helps' are busied in loading luggage on the roof, and stowing\r\nparcels in the boot and under the box-seat. Bills are being settled,\r\nand farewells said by the passengers, who are booked to travel by the\r\n'stage.' Death is assiduously attending to the loading of the coach,\r\nand he is courteously wedging a stout lady through the doorway. It\r\nis likely that he will not quit the travellers yet, but will ride,\r\nunobserved, a part of the journey, until, perhaps, in the night he will\r\ncontrive some fatal upset, and his evil whim will be accomplished.\r\n\r\nPlate 36. _Time, Death, and Eternity._\r\n\r\n    The song now bursts beyond the bounds of time,\r\n    And Immortality concludes the rhyme.\r\n\r\nAfter tracing Death's farcical pranks through seventy-one plates, in\r\nnearly all of which the mischief projected by the arch-foe is crowned\r\nwith success, the artist has thought proper to abandon Death's triumphs\r\nand to show the enemy at a disadvantage. The scene is allegorically\r\nset forth in the despair and overthrow of Time, and the banishment of\r\nDeath before the Everlasting Angel. The Spirit of Eternity is blowing\r\nthe last trump. Time is vainly tearing out his forelock; his wings\r\nare useless; he is cast on his back, the scythe and hourglass broken,\r\namidst the crumbling monuments around him; pyramids and temples are\r\nmelting away; the monuments raised by vain man are dissolving, and\r\nDeath has forfeited his fell sovereignty of destruction. The slayer\r\nis slain in turn; his crown has fallen into the abyss, his fatal dart\r\nis harmless and snapped asunder, and he, abashed and disconcerted, is\r\ncrouching from his doom, and falling through to the bottomless pit. So\r\nmuch for the pictorial allegory.\r\n\r\nWe have specially dwelt on the illustration which Rowlandson designed\r\nto finish the first part of the _Dance of Death_, wherein the spectral\r\ntyrant is displayed shorn of his terrors. The artist on occasions could\r\nsink the ludicrous and rise to the sublime.\r\n\r\nThe author, as we are inclined to believe, was elevated by the subject\r\nbrought under his treatment, and, finding the theme congenial to his\r\ntalents, he exerted himself to bring out its stronger points. In the\r\nlast picture which concludes the series we are still more impressed\r\nwith the sense of his fitness for the task. Coombe, when he wrote the\r\nconcluding verses to this diversified poem, was on the verge of four\r\nscore; he had fought the battle of life, and found little glory and\r\nless profit in the struggle. Nature had endowed him with an agreeable\r\nperson and sound health, and he was by disposition studious. He had\r\nbeen the idol of an hour, and (rare chance for a scholar) had found a\r\nlarge sum of money at his command, and dissipated sufficient wealth\r\nto realise to the full the emptiness of gratifications which depend\r\non mere monetary advantages; he had been taught the worthlessness of\r\nfair-weather friends, the hollowness of flatterers, and knew the folly\r\nof trusting in the great; he had learned other lessons of life, and\r\ncould, from his own heart, read many a homily on the deceptiveness of\r\nbeauty and the quickly withered flowers of passion. He had incessantly\r\npursued happiness through life; he had been rich, courted, cultivated,\r\ntemperate, and a discriminating judge of most things that are counted\r\ndesirable in the world; a ripe scholar and a perfect gentleman--if we\r\nmay believe contemporary accounts--and he found all this led him to\r\ndisappointment and the confinement of a debtor's prison.\r\n\r\n    When evil tongues hiss forth the foul abuse,\r\n    When Fortune turns away, and friends prove false,\r\n    Man's peaceful refuge is the tomb.\r\n\r\nFrom the depths of his rich experience he had realised that the harbour\r\nof refuge 'from life's frequent storms' is found, _not_--\r\n\r\n    In the flowery vales where Pleasure sports,\r\n    Nor where Ambition rears the tottering seat;\r\n    'Tis not within the miser's gloomy cave;\r\n    'Tis not within the roseate bowers of Love,\r\n    Nor where the pale lamp lights the studious sage\r\n    To midnight toil: alas! it is not there.\r\n    And while we seek in vain amid the great,\r\n    Or on the gorgeous thrones where monarchs sit,\r\n    It often may be found in humble cot\r\n    Where Virtue with the honest peasant dwells.\r\n    And what is virtue? 'Tis the conscious power\r\n    Of acting right in spite of every foe\r\n    That may oppose its base, malicious aim\r\n    To check the pure designs which it inspires.\r\n    It is to stem the tide Corruption rolls\r\n    O'er half the world, to curb the impetuous will\r\n    Of lawless passion, and, on life's vast stage,\r\n    To act that noble part which will attain\r\n    The good man's praise and the applause of Heaven.\r\n    Yes, virtue, potent virtue, can secure\r\n    'Gainst every peril; 'tis a triple shield\r\n    To him who has it 'gainst the pointed darts\r\n    Of ev'ry enemy; the hour of death,\r\n    With all its gloom, gives not a fear to him\r\n    Who triumphs o'er the grave; he stands secure\r\n    Amid the ruins of a fallen world.\r\n    Virtue will listen to the trumpet's sound\r\n    With holy awe, yet hear it unappall'd,\r\n    And feels ETERNITY its destin'd sphere:\r\n    When all the works of man shake to their base,\r\n    And the world melts away whereon they stood;\r\n    When TIME'S last agonising hour is come,\r\n    And DEATH, who from Creation's pregnant hour\r\n    Has made the world a grave, himself shall die;\r\n    When man from his long slumber shall awake,\r\n    And the day breaks that never more shall close;\r\n    Then Virtue shall its promis'd glory claim,\r\n    And find it, too, at the o'erflowing source\r\n    Of Heaven's stupendous and eternal joys.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[26] Now known as the Egyptian Hall.\r\n\r\n[27] _Marcus Flaminius; or, the Life of the Romans_, 1795.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1817.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE VICAR OF WAKEFIELD.]\r\n\r\n1817-1823. _The Vicar of Wakefield, a Tale, by Doctor Goldsmith._\r\nIllustrated with twenty-four designs by Thomas Rowlandson.

As this family and ours had\r\nlong a sort of rivalry in point of taste, our spirit took the alarm at\r\nthis stolen march upon us; and notwithstanding all I could say, and I\r\nsaid much, it was resolved that we should have our pictures done too.\r\nHaving, therefore, engaged the limner--for what else could I do?--our\r\nnext deliberation was to show the superiority of our taste in the\r\nattitudes. As for our neighbour's family, there were seven of them,\r\nand they were drawn with seven oranges, a thing quite out of taste--no\r\nvariety in life, no composition in the world. We desired to have\r\nsomething in a brighter style; and after many debates at length came to\r\na unanimous resolution of being drawn together in one large historical\r\nfamily piece. This would be cheaper, since one frame would serve for\r\nall, and it would be infinitely more genteel, for all families of any\r\ntaste were now drawn in the same manner. As we did not immediately\r\nrecollect an historical subject to hit us we were contented each with\r\nbeing drawn as independent historical figures. My wife desired to\r\nbe represented as Venus, and the painter was desired not to be too\r\nfrugal of his diamonds in her stomacher and hair. Her two little ones\r\nwere to be as Cupids by her side; while I, in my gown and band, was\r\nto present her with my books on the Whistonian controversy. Olivia\r\nwould be drawn as an Amazon, sitting on a bank of flowers, dressed\r\nin a green joseph, richly laced with gold, and a whip in her hand.\r\nSophia was to be a shepherdess, with as many sheep as the painter could\r\nput in for nothing; and Moses was to be dressed out with a hat and\r\nwhite feather. Our taste so much pleased the Squire that he insisted\r\non being put in as one of the family, in the character of Alexander\r\nthe Great, at Olivia's feet. This was considered by us all as an\r\nindication of his desire to be introduced into the family; nor could\r\nwe refuse his request. The painter was therefore set to work; and as\r\nhe wrought with assiduity and expedition, in less than four days the\r\nwhole was completed. The piece was large, and it must be owned he did\r\nnot spare his colours, for which my wife gave him great encomiums. We\r\nwere all perfectly satisfied with his performance; but an unfortunate\r\ncircumstance had not occurred till the picture was finished, which now\r\nstruck us with dismay. It was so very large that we had no place in\r\nthe house to fix it. How we all came to disregard so material a point\r\nis inconceivable; but certain it is we had been all greatly remiss.\r\nThe picture, therefore, instead of gratifying our vanity, as we hoped,\r\nleaned in a most mortifying manner against the kitchen wall, where the\r\ncanvas was stretched and painted, much too large to be got through any\r\nof the doors, and the jest of all our neighbours. One compared it to\r\nRobinson Crusoe's longboat, too large to be removed; another thought it\r\nmore resembled a reel in a bottle; some wondered how it could be got\r\nout, but still more were amazed how it got in.'\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n                      THE DANCE OF LIFE: A POEM.\r\n\r\n         _By the Author of 'Doctor Syntax' (William Coombe)._\r\n\r\n ILLUSTRATED WITH TWENTY-SIX COLOURED ENGRAVINGS BY THOMAS ROWLANDSON.\r\n\r\nLONDON: PUBLISHED BY R.

Paddy from Cork, hayfork in\r\nhand, has literally turned his coat hind part before; he is dancing\r\nin company with another swain, who is holding a whisky-jug, and a\r\nfellow Patlander, fiddling and capering for very life, beside two buxom\r\nlasses, who are flourishing hayrakes and throwing themselves into the\r\nmost attractive attitudes. Groups suggestive of both rural felicity and\r\na terrific combat in combination are figured in the distance, as the\r\ntrue Patland ideal of finishing a day's pleasure.\r\n\r\n1818(?). _Doncaster Fair, or the Industrious Yorkshire Bites._\r\nDesigned, etched, and published by T.

The lady, clad\r\nin a soldier's old jacket, with ragged skirts and defective hose, is\r\nholding in one arm an instalment of sticks--'three throws a penny'--and\r\nis demanding her fee, a trifle boisterously, from a smock-clad yokel,\r\nwho is diving into his short-clothes pocket for the coppers which do\r\nnot appear to be forthcoming. Other rustics are taking their pastime\r\nat the same amusement, and one, in perplexity, is scratching his head.\r\nThe bustle of a country fair is set forth in the distance; there is\r\nthe usual display of booths and mountebanks, countrymen on horseback,\r\nlove-making in carts, stalls, and struggling groups of sightseers.\r\n\r\n1818. _The Adventures of Johnny Newcome in the Navy._ A Poem, in four\r\ncantos, with Plates by Rowlandson, from the Author's designs.

The\r\npersons of both patriot and monster are mapped out with inscriptions,\r\ntheir several parts being typically labelled: '_The Genius of Honour_\r\nrejoices in a sound mind;' 'An eye ever watchful to the welfare of\r\nhis fellow-citizens;' 'A tongue that never belied a good heart;'\r\n'An upright breast and an honest heart;' 'A shoulder that never\r\nshrinks in trouble;' 'A plain liver and a lover of peace and plenty;'\r\n'Pockets ever open to the necessities of fellow-creatures;' 'A knee\r\nto religion;' 'Legs ever steady in his country's cause;' and 'Feet\r\nto crush tyranny;' while in his 'Hand of Justice' is displayed a\r\ndeclaration of these principles: 'A staunch supporter of the Bill\r\nof Rights; an advocate for a fair representation of the people, and\r\nan enemy to bribery and corruption.' The attributes of the corrupt\r\ncandidate are less flattering. The head of the monster is marked\r\n'Professions and promises;' his nose has 'a scent for Interest;' his\r\nhuge eye is devoted to Interest, and his mouth to Guile; he bears the\r\n'Collar of Corruption;' 'a cringing soul,' 'a pampered appetite;'\r\n'a rotten borough,' and 'secret service money' mark his trunk; his\r\n'arms of power' end in 'hands of extortion,' which grasp 'pensions,\r\nreversions, perquisites of office, and bags of bribery;' he is\r\nsupported on 'legs of luxury and feet of connivance.'\r\n\r\n1819. _Who killed Cock Robin?

Placed before the bent-down martyr to domestic infirmities is\r\na phantom bone of mutton; presumably the husband has taken exception\r\nboth to the insufficiency of the joint and the superabundance of smoke,\r\nwhich is eddying round in volumes, and is filling the apartment with\r\ndense blackness; while his better half, sailing like a fury out of the\r\ngloom, is an object to inspire terror in the boldest heart, and the\r\nstings of the sharp tongue are apparently even more intimidating than\r\nher nails or her knuckles, all of which weapons of offence are enlisted\r\nagainst her pitiable helpmate.\r\n\r\n1821. _Tricks on the Turf, or Settling how to Lose a Race._ Published\r\nby T. Rowlandson.--A scene on a racecourse; the race-horses, led round\r\nto be saddled, are seen in the background. A smart young jockey, with\r\nhis saddle strapped across his own back, and whip in hand, in readiness\r\nto begin the race, is receiving the parting instructions of a wily\r\nold turfite, who wears a cocked hat, a pigtail, a triple-caped coat,\r\ntop-boots and spurs. This shrewd trickster is evidently giving his\r\nrider certain secret instructions which he would probably not like to\r\nhear published abroad on his own authority. The subject of this satire,\r\ntogether with the scandals about the Prince of Wales's horse _Escape_\r\nand his jockey, prove that even in the early days of the Turf its\r\nreputation was not immaculate nor its patrons above suspicion.\r\n\r\n1821. _Journal of Sentimental Travels in the Southern Provinces of\r\nFrance shortly before the Revolution, embellished with seventeen\r\ncoloured engravings from designs by T.

This precaution I\r\nimpressed upon myself as soon as the four horses, whose neighing seemed\r\nto express the same feeling, were put to the carriage at the last\r\npost-station at Kehl.\r\n\r\n'This little place, situated partly on one, and partly on the other\r\nside of the Rhine, possesses an equivocal sort of character, which,\r\nlike the modest, innocent look of a frail fair one, is of great\r\nadvantage in the way of its trade.\r\n\r\n'The reflections on that extraordinary genius Voltaire, whom the\r\nmercantile spirit of Beaumarchais contrived to banish to this\r\nintermediate spot between Germany and France--excited as I passed\r\nthe extensive printing office established here for promoting the\r\ncirculation of his works--were too multifarious for the shortest of all\r\nstages; for the life of this extraordinary mortal would afford abundant\r\nmatter for contemplation during a tour round the globe, without being\r\neven then exhausted. My mind standing before him, like a dwarf before\r\na colossus, was about to measure his greatness, when I was under the\r\ndisagreeable necessity of turning the looks of my admiration another\r\nway, in order to cast them with contempt upon the most miserable of all\r\nthe _employés_ of the King, who waited my arrival at the barriers of\r\nStrasburg. The postilion seemed to be thinking no more about them than\r\nmyself, but the cry of \"Stop, scoundrel!\" from the throats of ten of\r\nthese varlets suddenly arrested the smart trot at which he was about to\r\npass them. I was instantly surrounded by the rascals, who enquired what\r\nI would give to save my baggage from examination. \"Nothing! nothing!\"\r\ncried I, in a tone that would have scared the nymphs of the Rhine.\r\n\"Nothing?\" re-bellowed the incorruptible agents of the Custom House.\r\n\"Nothing!\" I reiterated. \"I never make bargains with such fellows.\"\r\nWith a profusion of curses and oaths they fell to work upon my baggage,\r\nwhich they ransacked with all the avidity of rats that have got scent\r\nof a savoury piece of bacon.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SEARCHED BY DOUANIERS ON THE FRENCH FRONTIERS.]\r\n\r\n'Indeed, a small bribe would have prevented all this, but I was too\r\nmuch out of temper to submit to give alms to these beggars who had so\r\nrudely disturbed my meditations; for this reason my obstinacy--why\r\nshould I not call the child by its right name?--had received a severe\r\nreproof.'\r\n\r\n1821. _Le Don Quichotte Romantique, ou Voyage du Docteur Syntaxe à\r\nla Recherche du Pittoresque et Romantique._ 28 Illustrations drawn\r\non stone (after the designs of Rowlandson) by Malapeau.

Ackermann, at the Repository\r\nof Arts.\r\n\r\n    What various views of our uncertain state\r\n    These playful, unassuming rhymes relate!--ANON.\r\n\r\nIntroduction to the history of _Quæ Genus_.--'The favour which has\r\nbeen bestowed on the different tours of Doctor Syntax has encouraged\r\nthe writer of them to give a \"History of the Foundling,\" who has been\r\nthought an interesting object in the latter of those volumes, and it is\r\nwritten in the same style and manner, with a view to connect it with\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n'This child of chance, it is presumed, is led through a track of life\r\nnot unsuited to the peculiarity of his condition and character, while\r\nits varieties, as in the former works, are represented by the pencil of\r\nMr. Rowlandson with its accustomed characteristic felicity.\r\n\r\n'The idea of an English _Gil Blas_ predominated through the whole of\r\nthis volume, which must be considered as fortunate in no common degree,\r\nif its readers, in the course of their perusal, should be disposed to\r\nacknowledge even a remote similitude to the incomparable works of Le\r\nSage.\r\n\r\n                                                           'THE AUTHOR.\r\n\r\n    '_Johnny Quæ Genus!_ What a name\r\n    To offer to the voice of Fame!\r\n\r\n           *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    But howsoe'er the thing we view,\r\n    Our little Johnny's title's new:\r\n    Or for the child, or for the man,\r\n    In an old phrase, 'tis _spick_ and _span_.\r\n    Besides, as most folks do agree,\r\n    To find a charm in novelty,\r\n    'Tis the first time that grammar rule,\r\n    Which makes boys tremble when at school,\r\n    Did with the name an union crave\r\n    Which at the font a sponsor gave.\r\n    But whether 'twas in hum'rous mood\r\n    Or by some classic whim pursued,\r\n    Or as, in Eton's Grammar known,\r\n    It bore relation to his own,\r\n    Syntax, it was at Whitsuntide,\r\n    And a short time before he died,\r\n    In pleasant humour, after dinner,\r\n    Surnam'd, in wine, the little sinner.\r\n    And thus, amid the table's roar,\r\n    Gave him, from good old Lilly's store,\r\n    A name which none e'er had before.'\r\n\r\nThis quotation from the opening of Combe's Hudibrastic narrative will\r\naccount for the originality of the hero's eccentric title.\r\n\r\nRowlandson's illustrations are as follows:--\r\n\r\n    _Quæ Genus_ on his Journey to London.\r\n         \"      in search of Service.\r\n         \"      relating his History to Sir Jeffery.\r\n         \"      at Oxford.\r\n         \"      Conflict with Lawyer Gripeall.\r\n         \"      with the Sheep-shearers.\r\n         \"      assisting a Traveller.\r\n         \"      in the Sports of the Kitchen.\r\n         \"      in the Service of Sir Jeffery Gourmand.\r\n         \"      with a Quack Doctor.\r\n         \"      with a Spendthrift.\r\n         \"      attending on a Sporting Finale.\r\n         \"      in the Service of a Miser.\r\n         \"      and the Money Lenders.\r\n         \"      officiating at a Gaming-table.\r\n         \"      with a Portrait Painter.\r\n         \"      gives a grand party.\r\n         \"      interrupts a _tête-à-tête_.\r\n         \"      committed, with a riotous dancing party, to the\r\n                Watchhouse.\r\n         \"      engaged with jovial friends, or who Sings best.\r\n    The party breaking up, and _Quæ Genus_ breaking down.\r\n    _Quæ Genus_ turned out of a House which he mistakes for his own.\r\n         \"      and Creditors.\r\n         \"      discovers his Father.\r\n\r\n1822. _Rowlandson's Sketches from Nature._\r\n\r\n     A View near Richmond.

Broadway, Ludgate Hill.--The dinner-hunter,\r\nevidently a well-to-do but miserly person, to whom avarice dictates\r\nthe pursuit of the victuals of his acquaintances, has called at the\r\nwell-appointed house of a friend at the exact dinner-hour, since a boy\r\nfrom an adjacent public-house is handing in the beer; but the footman,\r\nwho recognises the visitor's object, is prepared with the chilling\r\ninformation, 'Not at home.' On the opposite side of the street is\r\nrepresented an _à la mode_ beef shop, to which sundry stout diners\r\nare resorting. The execution of this plate is above the average, the\r\netching being worked out with both care and spirit. A companion print,\r\nexecuted with similar finish, was issued by the same publisher.\r\n\r\n_June 19, 1823._ _An Old Poacher Caught in a Snare._--The old poacher\r\nhas evidently come on a dangerous quest, and is fairly trapped.\r\nThe object of his snares, a handsome and elegantly-drawn lady, is\r\nthrusting the old sinner, suddenly disturbed by the unexpected return\r\nof the husband, into the embrasure of the fireplace, and endeavouring\r\nto conceal the marauder with the board which was used to close the\r\nchimneypiece. The injured spouse has evidently been out hunting, and\r\nhas purposely returned on a more particular quest; whip in hand, he\r\nis bursting into the room. The hat and stick of the hoary poacher are\r\nthrown to the ground, and the hunter's hounds are tearing in on a good\r\nscent which promises fitting retribution to be dealt on the head of the\r\ndetected evil-doer.\r\n\r\n1823. _Hot Goose, Cabbage, and Cucumbers._\r\n\r\n_September 18, 1823._ _The Chance-seller of the Exchequer Putting\r\nan Extinguisher on Lotteries._ Published by Tom Brown, Peter\r\nStreet, Westminster.--The Chancellor of the Exchequer is literally\r\nextinguishing Fortune, who is represented as a comely and youthful\r\nwinged female holding a well-filled purse in one hand and a lottery\r\nprize for 2,000_l._ in the other. At her feet are caskets of gems and\r\njewels; she is seated on well-filled sacks; behind her is the wheel\r\nof fortune. A crowd of Bluecoat Boys are urging their entreaties.\r\n'Come, madam,' cries the Chancellor, 'put on your nightcap.' A chorus\r\nof cries of disappointment proceeds from a mob of persons in front.\r\nOne agonised lady of elegant exterior is praying: 'Stop; let me get a\r\nprize first.' A laundress, pointing to the washing-tub, cries, 'Let\r\nher alone; take off the soap tax.' 'Shut up the subscription houses,'\r\nurges another. A cobbler shouts, 'Give us a lottery, and no leather\r\ntax;' another cries out, 'No tax on tallow,' and a parson denounces\r\nhorse-racing. On the column behind Madame Fortune suggestive placards\r\nare pasted: 'Races, King's Cup,' 'Reform Parliament, Public Morals,'\r\nand '_Fudge: a Farce_.' Various Ministerial and Parliamentary critics\r\nare discussing the new measure. One is saying, 'Little Van [Vansittart]\r\nknew better than to abolish a voluntary tax;' another is pointing out,\r\n'He's only a young Chancellor;' while a third, alluding to the popular\r\noutcry in relation to existing imposts, remarks, 'Hear, hear! I knew\r\nthey'd grumble.' A less disinterested party is taking the opportunity\r\nto secure prize bags, gold-dust 'pickings and fillings' from the upset\r\nof Fortune's cornucopia; he cries, 'Persevere, and the saints shall\r\npraise you.'\r\n\r\n1823. _Third Tour of Doctor Syntax._ Royal 8vo.\r\n\r\n1823. _The Three Tours of Doctor Syntax._ Pocket edition, 3 vols. 16mo.\r\n(See description of _The Three Tours of Doctor Syntax_, 1812.)\r\n\r\n1823. _Oliver Goldsmith.

A stout wench has called in to have an obstinate grinder\r\ndragged out of her head; '_torment and torture_' are mild terms for\r\nthe operation. The patient is seated in the chair of agony. Factotum's\r\nassistant, a lad whose offices seem as diversified as those of his\r\nmaster, has brought an elegant pair of horse-pliers for the delicate\r\nprocess of extraction. A dog is setting up a sympathetic howl;\r\nthis animal is one of the grotesque nondescripts which Rowlandson\r\ndelighted to depict after his own theories, careless whether literal\r\ncritics, unfamiliar with his admirable studies after nature, took upon\r\nthemselves to assert that he could not master the drawing of animals.\r\nFrom the agonised expression which the artist has succeeded in throwing\r\ninto the canine features it would appear as if Toby was also a patient\r\nattending the dentist's tender offices in his turn. An old country\r\ndame who is also distracted with a raging molar is waiting without.\r\nOne branch of our friend's business is obviously flourishing. Although\r\nthe rustic practitioner does not display his diploma from the College\r\nof Surgeons, or his licence to kill by authority, he has nailed up\r\na certificate with which, it is probable, he is equally satisfied:\r\n'_Barnaby Factotum; Draws Teeth, Bleeds and Shaves; Wigs made here;\r\nalso Sausages.

In two volumes.\r\nLondon, 8vo. Plate 32. _R.--A.--ys of Genius Reflecting on the True\r\nLine of Beauty at the Life Academy, Somerset House._ By Thomas\r\nRowlandson.--This plate, which is dated June 1, 1824 (published by\r\nSherwood & Jones), was not, we fancy, designed expressly for the\r\n_English Spy_, as we cannot fail to recognise it as an adaptation of\r\na very spirited caricature by the artist belonging to a considerably\r\nearlier period, and described as _Drawing from the Nude_. In the\r\noriginal the students are dressed in the costume of some forty years\r\nanterior to 1824; their quainter persons are delineated with more\r\ngrotesque spirit and boldness of treatment. Be this as it may, whether\r\nRowlandson has obliged his friend Westmacott by adding new figures,\r\nor whether the original design has been otherwise supplemented with\r\nlater portraits, the female model remains much as she is found in the\r\nlarger drawing. The artists, who are working from the life in this\r\nmore modern version, are chiefly Royal Academicians, as far as the\r\nprivileged circle is concerned, and the portraits are studied with\r\ncare. M. A. Shee is seated on the ground; one of the Landseers is\r\nabove him; the person of Benjamin West, arrayed in decorous black,\r\nwith his knee-breeches, silk stockings, and laced frill, bears a\r\nresemblance to a Court physician; Westmacott, Jones, Chantrey, and\r\nhalf a dozen other artists, evident likenesses, are portrayed with a\r\ncertain attention to securing resemblance. In the right-hand corner,\r\nstanding at an easel, is the figure of B. R. Haydon; and seated between\r\nthis unfortunate artist and the fair model is another student, on\r\nwhose drawing-board are the initials 'C. W.,' which may be intended\r\nas a complimentary introduction of the person of Charles Westmacott,\r\nthe author of the publication in question. This plate, which is a\r\nhighly interesting addition to Blackmantle's _English Spy_, is the\r\nonly full-page illustration due to the caricaturist; and Mr. William\r\nBates, B.A., commenting on this contribution in an interesting sketch\r\nof Rowlandson's works, pronounces it decisively 'the best plate in the\r\nwork.' The first volume contains numerous vignettes on wood, which\r\nthe index describes as being 'from original designs by Cruikshank,\r\nRowlandson, Gillray, and Finlay, engraved by Bonner and Hughes.' These\r\nengravings are neither signed nor ascribed to the respective designers\r\nmentioned in the index; but, as far as we can trace, very little is\r\noffered of Rowlandson's beyond the advertisement of his name.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1831.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            THE HUMOURIST.\r\n\r\n      A COMPANION FOR THE CHRISTMAS FIRESIDE.

ACKERMANN, JUN.,\r\n                       191 REGENT STREET, 1831.\r\n\r\nThe author, in his preface, thus refers to the circumstances under\r\nwhich these illustrations by a deceased artist have been imported into\r\nan annual:--\r\n\r\n'Of the embellishments to which, after the manner of annuals in\r\ngeneral, the matter has been adapted, it will be a sufficient\r\nrecommendation to state that the designs have been carefully selected\r\nfrom a great variety of original drawings by the late Mr. Rowlandson,\r\nthe humour of whose pencil has been long universally acknowledged,\r\nand no expense has been spared to render the engravings worthy of the\r\nsubjects.'\r\n\r\nThe principal illustrations are as follows:--\r\n\r\n    Frontispiece. _The Humourist and her Crew._--The model of a ship,\r\n    drawn by a donkey, followed by an escort of seamen, who have\r\n    severally lost a leg in the service of their country; they are\r\n    singing lustily, and appealing to the charitably inclined.\r\n\r\n    Vignette. _The Doctors Puzzled._--A circle of grave practitioners.\r\n\r\n      \"    \"    \" A learned consultation.\r\n\r\n      \"    Death pounding a mortar, as the apothecary's assistant.\r\n    ('Great allowance to dealers in quack medicines.') This subject\r\n    occurs in the _Dance of Death_ (1814).\r\n\r\n    I have a secret art to cure\r\n    Each malady which men endure.\r\n\r\n_Uncle Timothy._--A fat equestrian trying to mount a restive steed.\r\n\r\nVignette. Umbrella flirtations on horseback.\r\n\r\n_The March of Intellect._--A bibliophilist doctor rummaging a bookstall.\r\n\r\n_The Man of Business._--A grave curmudgeon turning his back on the\r\nbeguilements of certain pretty oyster-wenches at their stall.\r\n\r\n_The Rivals._--A scene outside the premises of Dorothy Dump,\r\nclear-starcher, and the box of a tailor. The knight of the thimble\r\nhas thrust his head out of his narrow window, while he listens in\r\nconsternation to the railings of the elderly clear-starcher, who is\r\njealously disputing the right of a young and buxomly-developed fair to\r\nthe attentions of the 'snip' their neighbour.\r\n\r\n_An Enemy bearing down: Hope in the distance._--An enraged bull is\r\nthrowing various rural pedestrians into commotion. A stout lady is\r\nendeavouring to escape over a stile; a one-legged veteran is hurrying\r\nher movements, as his own position is becoming precarious; and a young\r\ndamsel is left sprawling on the grass; meanwhile the infuriated brute\r\nis receiving a check from a dog, which he is endeavouring to toss.\r\n\r\n_Too Hot and too Late._--Several stout Sunday excursionists, at various\r\ndistances apart, are toiling up a hill in the broiling midday sun to\r\nreach a suburban tavern, where is held, as was the custom at that\r\nperiod, an ordinary on holidays for the benefit of Cockney travellers.\r\nA stout pedestrian, mopping his forehead, and followed by his panting\r\ndog, who takes after his master in obesity, is at the bottom of the\r\nhill; the pair are evidently epicures, and the prospect of the ascent\r\nwith the probability of arriving only to find the viands swept away\r\nby the eager appetites of earlier arrivals is evidently filling their\r\nminds with dread.\r\n\r\n_Fire and Water._--A riverside alehouse; customers on benches,\r\nindulging in pots and pipes. A waterman, who is probably indebted\r\nto the alewife, is receiving a warm reception on the ground of\r\nunliquidated scores of long standing which he has attempted to increase.\r\n\r\n_Steering._--An old admiral, driving his wife in a curricle, has some\r\ndifficulty in restraining the skittishness of a pair of badly-trained\r\nsteeds, whose eccentric career is threatening the whole concern with\r\nannihilation.\r\n\r\n_Bar Practice._--Interior of a tavern, guests at tables; in the front\r\nof the picture is the saloon; a showy counter-maid is compounding a\r\nbowl of punch for a brace of customers, a military and a sporting buck,\r\nwho are leaning over the bar and exchanging pleasantries with the\r\nlandlady.\r\n\r\n_Getting Cash for Notes._--A blind Scotch bagpiper, going his rounds\r\nof the country, is passing a cottage; certain charitable damsels, who\r\nare clustered about the portal are acknowledging the piper's notes with\r\ncoppers.\r\n\r\n_A Timekeeper._--A Doctor of Music, in his robes, is beating time\r\nwith a roll of music, and conducting a mixed choir of girls and lads;\r\nall the members of the party are evidently bawling their utmost and\r\nstraining their tuneful throats.\r\n\r\n_The Italian Scribe. An out-of-doors Amanuensis._--A similar subject to\r\nthat represented in the _Letters from Italy_, republished as _Naples\r\nand the Campagna Felice_ (1809-13). (See _The Letter Writer_, 1815.)\r\n\r\n_Love in a Box._--A Hebrew gentleman, evidently a Shylock, is\r\ngravely trudging along the ways of some Continental city--it may\r\nbe Venice--with a bunch of keys in his hand; three picturesque and\r\nMasaniello-like looking porters are in his train, one is bearing a\r\ntrunk, and two are carrying, suspended on a pole, a large square\r\nreceptacle, the contents of which are implied to be of a romantic\r\nnature.\r\n\r\n_The Pleasures of Solitude._--An old gourmand is solacing his solitary\r\nstate of dining by an excess of creature-comforts; his servants are\r\nbringing in fresh courses to add to a selection of dishes already amply\r\nsufficient for the needs of an individual, and his butler is supplying\r\nhim with wine on an excessive scale.\r\n\r\n_Rich and Poor._--A pensioner, minus a leg, and otherwise under the\r\n'slings of adverse fortune,' has called to solicit some trifling\r\nassistance from a wealthy sybarite; the poor man's exertions in the\r\nrepresentation of his case seem thrown away, as the person solicited is\r\nso deaf to his eloquence that, even with the assistance of a trumpet,\r\nhe fails to hear the appeal of the suitor.\r\n\r\n_Village Politicians._--The wiseheads of the hamlet are portentously\r\ndiscussing the contents of a news sheet in the vicinity of the sign of\r\nthe 'Bugle Horn.'\r\n\r\n_A Disciplinarian._--A Zantippe of a wife, with a flood of invective,\r\nis driving her cowed husband before her, whose advance is further\r\naccelerated by the liberal exercise of a stout cudgel, which is raining\r\nstrokes on the bent back of the unmanned and overawed victim.\r\n\r\n_An Admirer._--A comely maiden, standing with her pitcher beside a\r\npump, is asking assistance to raise her load of an idiotic rustic\r\ndandy, who is staring and grinning his imbecile admiration with a face\r\nmarvellously well fitted to fill a horse-collar, but who does not\r\notherwise respond to the girl's request.\r\n\r\n_The Cow Doctor._--A consultation over the condition of a suffering cow.\r\n\r\n_Taking a Horse to Water._--In this case, it rather seems, the steeds\r\nare taking their riders there and leaving them--soused in the brook.\r\n\r\n_Lost and Won._--A gaily-apparelled nymph is leaning over the palings\r\nof a waterside landing-stage. A waterman is looking on in dudgeon;\r\nhe is evidently the 'loser;' whilst the fickle fair is making tender\r\ndemonstrations in favour of a dashing young soldier, whose uniform and\r\nmartial trim have evidently won the changeable lady's heart.\r\n\r\n_A Man of Colour._--At the portico of a villa stands the black butler,\r\nwho is emptying a plateful of victuals into the apron of a comely\r\nfemale tramp, with a child slung on her back; the _darkie_ is evidently\r\nmoved by the attractions of the gipsy, since his face expresses the\r\nmost unqualified admiration for her personal allurements.\r\n\r\n_Civic Enjoyments._--A dinner party assembled in a Guildhall. The\r\nhealth of the entertainer is being uproariously received as a 'standing\r\ntoast' with full-charged bumpers.\r\n\r\n_A Siege._--A highly genteel, youthful, and elegantly clad\r\nlady--whether maid or widow it is difficult to determine--is\r\nsurrounded by a crowd of suitors, recruited from pretty nearly all the\r\nprofessions, and of all ages and sizes. The object of this profuse\r\nidolatry, perfectly unmoved, is waving off her too presumptuous\r\nassailants, whose assiduities interfere with her comfort.\r\n\r\n_Recruiting._--A party of soldiers on ''listing' service in a country\r\ntown have secured certain volunteers. One of the new recruits, a\r\nsprightly damsel, is creating no little consternation in the breasts of\r\nthe villagers by joining the troopers' march; a cobbler and a tailor,\r\narmed with the implements of their trade, are offering some show of\r\nresistance to the abduction of this Helen by a smart young Paris 'in\r\nthe line;' but these deserted swains are kept at a respectful distance\r\nby the bayonet of the gay Lothario's comrade.\r\n\r\n_Knowledge of the World._--A village pedagogue is instructing his\r\npupils in that elaborate branch of fashionable education (according\r\nto school prospectuses at the beginning of the century), 'the use of\r\nthe globes.' Certain mischievous urchins are taking advantage of the\r\npreceptor's preoccupation to insert quill pens into the 'Busby' wig of\r\nthe learned Doctor.\r\n\r\n_Modern Antiquities._--A variation of the larger engraving on this\r\nsubject published (by Tegg) under the same title.\r\n\r\n_A Man of Taste._--A fat old voluptuary, in a 'nautical rig,' in\r\nperson not unlike (and probably expressly designed for) the convivial\r\nand yachting alderman, Sir William Curtis, is critically inspecting\r\nthrough his eyeglass a small selection of shellfish held out for his\r\ngratification by a pretty shrimper-maid of pronounced personal graces.\r\n\r\n_Looking a Broadside._--A stout party of the old school, of great\r\nbreadth and solidity, is looking daggers at a dandified fop of the\r\nperiod, a mere scarecrow of a figure, who is 'quizzing' the substantial\r\npiece of antiquity through a spyglass. The indignation of the old boy\r\nis barely appeased by the soothing caresses of a tender and pretty\r\nmaiden who is clinging to the incensed veteran.\r\n\r\n_Credulity._--A fashionable, elegant, and good-looking lady is seated\r\nat her breakfast-table, while her maid is arranging the apartment. A\r\nmessenger or letter-carrier has just brought a _billet-doux_, which the\r\nconfiding beauty is eagerly perusing.\r\n\r\n_Indecision._--An obese prebendary, his gouty limb supported on\r\ncushions, is in all the perplexities of _embarras de choix_; one maiden\r\nis bringing in poultry, as appropriate to the day's dinner, shortly to\r\nfollow in due course; and a fish-girl has offered an equally attractive\r\nchoice of fish. The arrival of these luxuries and the necessity of\r\nselecting between them is vexing the soul of the good man.\r\n\r\n_Spoiling a Cloak and Making a Fortune._--Another version of the\r\ntraditional episode of the gallant Raleigh laying down his mantle\r\nat the feet of his sovereign lady Queen Elizabeth to bridge over an\r\nundesirable crossing.\r\n\r\n_A Military Salute._--A gallant officer engaged in amorous dalliance\r\nwith a tender-hearted fair, who is leaning out of a cottage window\r\nto receive the courtesies of the dashing warrior. Another version\r\nof _Kissing for Love, or Captain Careless Shot Flying by a Girl of\r\nFifteen, who unexpectedly popped her Head out of a Casement_ (May 1810).\r\n\r\n_A Bagman._--A tired commercial traveller, cloaked, booted, and\r\nspurred, is alighting at the 'Woolpack;' his horse is taken to\r\nthe stable; his saddle-bag is under his arm; and the buxom and\r\nbroadly-expanded hostess of the inn is standing at the portal to bid\r\nthe weary pilgrim welcome.\r\n\r\n_Obtaining the Countenance of the Minister._--An Italian itinerant\r\nvendor of 'images' is offering a citizen the chance of purchasing the\r\nhead of the Government on easy terms, as far as his plaster bust is\r\nconcerned.\r\n\r\n_Training._--A jockey, with his saddle strapped on his back, ready to\r\nmount for the race, is receiving the final and special instructions of\r\nhis patron, a venerable and evidently deep file, well versed in the\r\niniquities of the turf, whose face wears an expression of experienced\r\nand long-trained cunning. Another version of _Tricks of the Turf, or\r\nSettling how to Lose a Race_ (1821).\r\n\r\n_An Exhibition._--The fashionable attendants at a gallery of pictures.\r\nAll the spectators are lost in wonder and admiration at the collection\r\nof paintings. The figure of the Duke of Gloucester is 'taken off,' with\r\nthat of other visitors. A partial transcript of the _Portrait Painters\r\nGallery.--Adventures of Johnnie Quæ Genus_.\r\n\r\n_A Banquet._--Three _convives_ are enjoying their soup, seated in a\r\nsort of supper-box; the French _chef_ is prominently shown before his\r\ncooking-range, busied in the compounding of some extensive _pot au feu_.\r\n\r\n_The Ratcatcher._--As the title expresses, the figure of a professional\r\nratcatcher, with a cage full of prisoners, which he is exhibiting to\r\na venerable couple--probably his employers; his dogs are excited at\r\nthe prospect of the sport. Another version of Rowlandson's _London\r\nCharacters_.\r\n\r\n_A Court Day._--A small rendering of _A Levée at St. James's Palace_.\r\nThe Beef-eaters are on duty, and crowds of courtiers and distinguished\r\nrepresentatives, clerical, military, diplomatic, civil, foreign, &c.,\r\nare proceeding through the reception-room for the privilege of making\r\ntheir bow to royalty.\r\n\r\n_A Dark Prospect._--A master-sweeper and his lad are seated, on their\r\nsoot-bags, by the can of a pretty and picturesquely-attired dairymaid,\r\nwho has supplied the dark customers with cups of 'clean milk from the\r\ncow.'\r\n\r\n_Symptoms of a Dinner._--A meeting of dignified prelates of the Church;\r\namongst the company are certain bigwigs, bishops, who are received with\r\nflattering deference by the lower clergy. Two eager members of the\r\ncloth, more set on the serious gratifications of a Convocation festival\r\nthan the empty ceremonial courtesies of the hour, are examining a\r\nsun-dial in the foreground and comparing it with their watches, in\r\nexpectation of dinner-time.\r\n\r\n_The Studio._--A painter, in Court costume, is daubing away boldly\r\nat his picture, surrounded at a respectful distance by a circle of\r\n_dilettanti_ connoisseurs, all of whom sport spectacles or eyeglasses;\r\nthese critical spectators are engaged in cold contemplation of the work\r\nbefore them.\r\n\r\n_Vignette._--A second group of _cognoscenti_, whose faces in this case\r\nexpress more interest and admiration, and justly so, since the work\r\nbefore them appeals to their tenderest susceptibilities; it is one they\r\ncan all appreciate--a lively turtle, ready to be converted into real\r\nsoup. A number of clergymen are following the lead of their bishop,\r\nwho, excellent man, is evidently longing to bless the good things which\r\nbeneficent Nature has here provided for the faithful.\r\n\r\n_Hydrophobia: the Church in Danger._--A pastor is running his hardest,\r\npursued by a dog, which we are to suppose is suffering from _rabies_;\r\nthe venerable prelate is doing his best to keep in advance of his\r\npursuer, who in turn is followed by a _possé_ of eager philanthropists,\r\narmed with pitchforks, flails, spits, pokers, choppers, shovels, and\r\neven pistols and guns, which are being discharged ineffectually, as the\r\ndog is managing to keep ahead of his would-be executioners.\r\n\r\n_The Way to Fill a Wherry._--A party, including the fair, have secured\r\ntheir places in a wherry at the riverside; the waterman is taking\r\nin one more customer before starting, an elephantine and venerable\r\ngentleman, whose advent has filled the occupants of the bark with\r\nalarm, the aquatic party evidently anticipating that they will be\r\nswamped at the very least by the ponderous weight of the last comer,\r\nwho is vainly trying to find a seat in the boat without capsizing it.\r\n\r\n_A View of the Coast._--A village inn, with a blind fiddler and his\r\ndaughter stationed upon the green outside; almost identical with the\r\nsubject published by Ackermann in Rowlandson's _World in Miniature_\r\n(see April 1, 1816).\r\n\r\n_Operatives._--The title of this plate goes by contraries.\r\n_Inoperatives_ should be the description. A pair of soakers are sunk\r\nin heavy slumber over the table of the taproom; a brace of industrious\r\nworking-men, whose ambitions in the direction of exertion are limited\r\nto 'raising their elbows,' 'tilting measures,' 'reducing the liquid\r\ncontents of receptacles for intoxicants,' and similar performances of\r\nan anti-temperance order.\r\n\r\n_Home, Sweet Home._--A drunken convivialist is, pipe in hand,\r\nunconsciously approaching the spot whose praises he is tipsily\r\nchaunting, quite unprepared for the reception that is awaiting his\r\nroystering at the hands of his outraged and furiously indignant wife,\r\nwho is anticipating his arrival with a cane prudently provided in\r\nadvance for further arguments upon the _douceurs_ of his rooftree.\r\n\r\nThe last print in Volume I. of _The Humourist_ is a vignette\r\nrepresenting a bench of fox-hunting justices, who have gone fast asleep\r\nin their respective armchairs, their legs on the table; bottles and\r\nbowls strewing the floor, and their dogs, scattered around, sunk in\r\nsleep as heavy as that indulged in by their masters. A transcript of\r\nthe plate _Johnny Quæ Genus Attending on a Sporting Finale--Adventures\r\nof Johnny Quæ Genus_ (1832).\r\n\r\nThe illustrations to Volume II. of _The Humourist_ are supplied by\r\nanother hand. It does not contain any further rendering of subjects\r\nafter Rowlandson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHRONOLOGICAL SUMMARY OF SUBJECTS\r\n\r\nSOCIAL AND POLITICAL CARICATURES,\r\n\r\nENGRAVED BY OR AFTER\r\n\r\nTHOMAS ROWLANDSON.\r\n\r\n_WITH HIS CONTRIBUTIONS TO BOOK ILLUSTRATION\r\n\r\nIN THE ORDER OF PUBLICATION._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSUMMARY OF ROWLANDSON'S CARICATURES.\r\n\r\n\r\n1774.\r\n\r\n  June 8.

Harvey, of St. James's Street, the result of many\r\nyears' vigilant activity in securing everything of consequence by the\r\nartist which happened to come into the print market, with comparative\r\nindifference to cost.\r\n\r\nThe arrangement of this gathering, already amounting to twenty-three\r\nvolumes, consisting entirely of excellent examples of the\r\ncaricaturist's engraved works, has been proceeding coincidently with\r\nthe preparation of the present volumes, and both selections have been\r\nbrought as near to completion as is practicable at precisely the same\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nThe writer has the satisfaction of realising that the promise referred\r\nto in his preface, made by Mr. Harvey many years ago, has been redeemed\r\nbefore it is altogether worthless, as concerns his desire to supply a\r\nsummary of the caricaturist's published productions as comprehensive\r\nas circumstances are likely to permit, to which much importance is\r\nattached from a collector's point of view.\r\n\r\nIt must be acknowledged that the extensive accumulation in the\r\npossession of Mr. Harvey has contributed to this result, if at the\r\neleventh hour; in his collection numerous examples of interest are\r\nfound which have hitherto escaped the Editor's researches. Many of\r\nthe titles set down in the body of the foregoing Summary and in the\r\nAddendum, drawn from the resources placed at his disposal by the\r\nkindness of Mr. Harvey, are in all probability perfectly novel to the\r\nmajority of even experienced 'Rowlandson fanciers.'\r\n\r\nNo date.\r\n\r\n  A Counsellor's Opinion after he had retired from\r\n  Practice.\r\n\r\n\r\n1790.\r\n\r\n            Croesus and Thalia.\r\n\r\n            All Fours.

The important catalogue of\r\nthe satirical prints and drawings in the British Museum, now in\r\ncourse of publication, will include all the examples found in that\r\ninstitution, if the Trustees decide to continue it beyond the limit\r\noriginally settled (about 1770). The preparation of the catalogue in\r\nquestion, which has been placed in the hands of probably the very\r\nablest authority on the subject of satire who has ever lived, is of\r\nnecessity a work of time. The elucidation of the earlier graphic\r\nsatires has occupied years of patient industry, by which alone the\r\nsocial and political pictorial 'skits' could be made intelligible--an\r\nundertaking which the lapse of time annually makes more complicated as\r\nregards the interpretation of those lighter trifles of bygone times,\r\nwhich, in spite of their triviality, often possess an historical value,\r\nunintelligible to the majority of students, because hidden away in the\r\nobscurity of allusions beyond the vision of the present generation.\r\n\r\nThe task of tracing and explaining the intentions of the graphic\r\nsatirists, commenced by Mr. Edward Hawkins, original owner of an\r\nimmense collection of their works, is being continued and successfully\r\ncarried out for the Trustees of the British Museum by Mr. Frederic\r\nGeorge Stephens. The catalogue, an important contribution to the\r\nhistory of the subject, has, as we have said, already been years in\r\nhand, and is slowly but surely advancing through the comparatively lost\r\npaths of the past. A new light has been thrown upon the satires of the\r\ntimes of the Tudors, the Stuarts, the Commonwealth, the Restoration,\r\nthe accession of the Prince of Orange and of the House of Hanover.\r\nThe results of the editor's painstaking researches are completed and\r\nopen for consultation up to the conclusion of the Hogarth period; the\r\nnotices upon the works of the great luminary of the school, which are\r\nincluded in the volume published in the present year, will be found\r\nof so thoroughly exhaustive a character, that the interest generally\r\nfelt in Hogarth is likely to be increased, especially as a considerable\r\namount of entirely new and curious matter has been discovered by Mr.\r\nStephens in the course of his investigations.\r\n\r\n\r\nCATALOGUE OF PRINTS AND DRAWINGS IN THE BRITISH MUSEUM.\r\n\r\nDiv. 1. Political and Personal Satires. Prepared for publication by\r\nFrederic George Stephens, and containing many descriptions by Edward\r\nHawkins, late Keeper of the Antiquities, F.S.A. Printed by order of the\r\nTrustees. With an introduction by George William Reid, Esq., Keeper of\r\nthe Prints and Drawings in the British Museum.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA selection of subjects, treated by Rowlandson with more freedom than\r\nis consonant with the taste of the latter half of the nineteenth\r\ncentury, is also given by PISANUS FRAXI, in his elaborate and\r\nexhaustive work CENTURIA LIBRORUM ABSCONDITORUM (1879). Pisanus Fraxi\r\nhas set down (pp. 346-398) descriptions of over one hundred and twenty\r\nsubjects of more or less erotic tendency. The major part of the\r\netchings included by this authority are of necessity inadmissible in\r\nthe present work, owing to their licentious suggestiveness; but a few\r\nof the subjects described in the 'Centuria Librorum Absconditorum,'\r\nrestricted exclusively to social caricatures by Rowlandson, the\r\noriginals of which maybe consulted in the Print Room and Library of the\r\nBritish Museum, are also instanced in the foregoing pages.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nORIGINAL DRAWINGS BY T.

The person of the artist is carefully studied, and\r\n  the items of his dress are most characteristically noted, this being\r\n  the time of Morland's most marked foppishness.\r\n\r\n  Guildhall Association.\r\n\r\n  Portrait of a Lady.\r\n\r\n  A Beau and his Chronometer.\r\n\r\n\r\nORIGINAL DRAWINGS BY THOMAS ROWLANDSON IN THE POSSESSION OF GEORGE\r\nWILLIAM REID, ESQ., KEEPER OF THE PRINTS AND DRAWINGS IN THE BRITISH\r\nMUSEUM.\r\n\r\n\r\n    View of a Castle.\r\n    View near Bridgport, Dorsetshire.\r\n    View in Devonshire.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWINDSOR CASTLE.

Signed\r\n  'Rowlandson,' and dated 1820.\r\n\r\n  Landscape. 16 × 10. Timber waggon drawn by eight horses crossing a\r\n  bridge, which spans a rapid stream struggling between high rocks;\r\n  cottages are on the left, one by the roadside, and another on the\r\n  hill.\r\n\r\n  Portsmouth Harbour.[29] 13 × 8.

A gouty old gentleman, his\r\n  wife and dog, promenade near the walls; another old fellow either\r\n  enraptured by a glance of the building or making love to two\r\n  servant-girls who look over the wall.

A crowd of ruffians on\r\n  horseback surround a man who is about to read a list of the names\r\n  of the favourite horses, but is interrupted by the impatience of\r\n  his companions, whom he endeavours to prevent riding over him; a\r\n  gouty old fellow, also on horseback, carries his crutches with him.\r\n  Engraved in this work. See description, vol. i. p. 257.\r\n\r\n\r\nILLUSTRATIONS TO 'THE TOUR OF DR.

It may not be generally known at the present time that\r\n  the Tours were written to elucidate the designs, which the following\r\n  introduction fully explains: 'This second tour is, like the former\r\n  one, a work of suggestions from the plates by Mr. Rowlandson, though\r\n  not with such entire reserve as the first. Some few of the subjects\r\n  may have been influenced by hints from me; and I am willing to\r\n  suppose that such are the least amusing of them.'--_Introduction to\r\n  the second volume_, 1820.\r\n\r\n  Dr. Syntax--unable to pull up at the Land's End--is fearful of being\r\n  carried to the World's End. 10 × 7. View on the coast during a storm,\r\n  with the vivid flashes of lightning frightening the people, and the\r\n  heavy waves dashing on the shore.\r\n\r\n  Dr. Syntax taking wine with a lady in a drawing-room, while the\r\n  daughter of his hostess and her lover exchange caresses on a rustic\r\n  seat under the verandah.\r\n\r\n  Dr. Syntax thrown off his horse while hunting. 7 × 8.\r\n\r\n    Your sport, my lord, I cannot take,\r\n    For I must go and hunt a lake.--Vol. i. p. 108.\r\n\r\n  Mr. Combe no doubt thought it as well, although availing himself\r\n  of the hint that hunting was not suited to the Doctor's taste, to\r\n  mention the fact of the Doctor being asked to join the sport, and his\r\n  declining the invitation, as he was about to make some drawings on\r\n  the lake.\r\n\r\n  Dr. Syntax leading a lady to the entrance of a grand mansion: most\r\n  probably giving the idea of the Doctor escorting Lady Bounty from the\r\n  garden to her mansion on their first interview. 9 × 5.\r\n\r\n    For while he sojourns he will be\r\n    The object of all courtesy.--Vol. ii. p. 217.\r\n\r\n  Dr. Syntax gazing at some ruins; a man and boy in attendance. 8 × 4.\r\n  One plate was probably thought sufficient to illustrate 'Sketching\r\n  the Ruins, and Tumbling into the Water,' through his seat giving way,\r\n  the latter one being used.\r\n\r\n    But now, alas! no more remains\r\n    Than will reward the painter's pains.\r\n                                      Vol. i. p. 71.\r\n\r\n  Dr. Syntax in the Jail; a young fellow and three dogs on the left.\r\n  7 × 4.\r\n\r\n  Boarding a Man-of-war. 8 × 5. A boatload of people awaiting their turn\r\n  to ascend a rope ladder, on which a gentleman of the party is fixed\r\n  in rather an uncomfortable position. _Vide_ 'Naples and the Campagna\r\n  Felice,' 1815, _ante_, pp. 301-2.\r\n\r\n  Dr. Syntax frightened by the appearance of a large fish having a form\r\n  resembling that of a whale; his companion and some fishwives are also\r\n  greatly alarmed, and a few of them lie sprawling on the ground. 8 × 4.\r\n\r\n  Dr. Syntax drawing the waterfall at Ambleside, while his man Patrick\r\n  is eating voraciously. 8 × 5.\r\n\r\n    Bold sketches from the very scene\r\n    Where, with his neighbours, he had been.\r\n                                  Vol. ii. p. 64.\r\n\r\n  A Lady repulsing with the poker her guests, consisting of eight\r\n  gentlemen, among whom is the Doctor; her dog by her side appears to\r\n  be equally pugnacious. 8 × 5.\r\n\r\n  Dr. Syntax riding and chatting with a lady, under an avenue of trees;\r\n  a footman behind them. 8 × 5.\r\n\r\n  Dr. Syntax playing at cards with a young lady; an old wooden-legged\r\n  officer seated near, apparently not in the best of tempers; three\r\n  other young ladies seated on the sofa take much interest in the game.\r\n  8 × 5.\r\n\r\n  Dr. Syntax gently opens the door of a garret, and is horrified to\r\n  find a woman of the _pavé_ reclining back in her chair dead; a dog is\r\n  seen on the left playing with her wig. 8 × 4.\r\n\r\n  Dr. Syntax skating and saluting three ladies who stand on the bank of\r\n  the frozen river. 8 × 5.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  The following drawings by Thomas Rowlandson, with several engravings\r\n  of his London views, already described under the accounts of his\r\n  prints in this work, were exhibited (1879) in the western portion\r\n  of the Exhibition Galleries, South Kensington, in the valuable and\r\n  interesting series of\r\n\r\n\r\nVIEWS OF LONDON AND WESTMINSTER.

BAKER,\r\nJ.P., ESQ., OF BAYFORDBURY PARK, HERTFORD.\r\n\r\nAt Bayfordbury Park--where, it will be remembered, the celebrated\r\ncollection of the Kit Cat Club, a national gallery of portraits, by Sir\r\nGodfrey Kneller, of the most interesting character, has its home--the\r\nchoice examples of Rowlandson's skill appear to have been secured by\r\nthe family at one time, and that at what may be considered the artist's\r\nbest period--a little before the production of _Vauxhall Gardens_, and\r\nthe series contributed to the exhibitions of the Royal Academy.\r\n\r\n  The Bath Coffee House. A highly amusing interior, representing the\r\n  various fashionable characters to be met with on the Great Bath and\r\n  Bristol Road a century back.\r\n\r\n  Rustic Scene. Carters' horses watering.\r\n\r\n  Scene outside a Lodge in a London Park, crowded with animated groups\r\n  of folks of _bon ton_, as they might be seen disporting themselves in\r\n  the fashionable resorts, where the 'best company' of the day was to\r\n  be encountered in 1785.\r\n\r\n  The Waggoner's Halt.\r\n\r\n  Sailors Soliciting Charity. A party of Rodney's 'old salts,'\r\n  disabled, and reduced to appeal to charity; a model of a ship-of-war\r\n  is dragged about on wheels to attract the attention and sympathies of\r\n  the passers-by.\r\n\r\n  French Barracks, 1786. A highly finished example of one of\r\n  Rowlandson's most famous subjects (exhibited at the Royal Academy,\r\n  1787). It probably preceded the exhibited drawing, since it is\r\n  executed on a somewhat reduced scale to that of the engraving. A\r\n  full description of this admirable design is given under the list of\r\n  subjects belonging to 1791 (Aug. 12).\r\n\r\n  Death and the Apothecary. This subject is drawn in Rowlandson's\r\n  most careful method. In the writer's opinion it is one of the\r\n  earliest examples of the artist's finished works which have come\r\n  under his attention, and is probably of the same date as the _School\r\n  of Eloquence_, mentioned under 1780, which, as he has noted, has\r\n  suffered at the hands of the anonymous etcher. Death, as a grim\r\n  skeleton, is intruding into the apartment of an invalid by the\r\n  window; the patient has armed himself with a gruelspoon to ward off\r\n  this sudden attack from the unassailable foe, while a corpulent\r\n  apothecary, standing in ambush behind his client, has snatched up\r\n  a gigantic syringe, which he is pointing, by way of a great gun,\r\n  at the bony framework of the ghastly actor who has dropped in to\r\n  complete the quack's handiwork and snatch away a profitable customer.\r\n  The whole of the background is worked out like a fine etching, in a\r\n  fainter line than the figures, much in the style which distinguishes\r\n  the etchings of Mortimer.\r\n\r\n  Hertford Market Place (market day). This view of the old county\r\n  town of Hertford is one of the finest and most interesting of those\r\n  drawings which Rowlandson has left of the quaint towns of his day.\r\n  It is altogether of an important character, being nearly 30 inches\r\n  in length. It represents the Town Hall, the market-place, and\r\n  certain picturesque ancient houses, faced with carved scroll-work,\r\n  which front the corner hard by. The traveller will find these\r\n  buildings exactly as Rowlandson viewed them a century ago; and, on\r\n  a market-day, he will see the dealers' stalls, the country people\r\n  busying themselves about their purchases, and the gentry passing or\r\n  riding by, called to the town on local affairs, in some respects\r\n  the same as a century ago. This scene, animated in itself as it\r\n  is presented in our day, falls very far short of the prospect the\r\n  artist has preserved, for the antique costumes have disappeared; and,\r\n  comfortable as may be those of the generation who occupy themselves\r\n  on the spot, the attractions found in the caricaturist's picture\r\n  are looked for in vain; for the light flowing robes, the hats and\r\n  feathers which aided the winning graces of the fair, the nodding\r\n  plumes, and the scarlet and gold of the military bucks, the rustling\r\n  silk cassocks, shovel-hats, and full-bottom wigs of the Church\r\n  dignitaries, and all such characteristic accessories of the scene,\r\n  no longer display themselves to assist the observer's sense of the\r\n  picturesque.\r\n\r\n\r\nORIGINAL DRAWINGS BY THOMAS ROWLANDSON.

We have to instance a spirited drawing by the\r\ncaricaturist, which is in the possession of Mr. Stogdon: 'Forbidden\r\nFruit.'\r\n\r\n\r\nFIGURE DRAWINGS AFTER THE OLD MASTERS BY THOMAS ROWLANDSON, IN THE\r\nCOLLECTION OF COLONEL GOULD WESTON, THURLOE SQUARE.\r\n\r\n  Venus: Carlo Marratti.\r\n\r\n  Venus: Bouchér.\r\n\r\n  Nymph Surprised by Satyr: Gerard Lairesse.\r\n\r\n  Diana and Hunter: Gerard Lairesse.\r\n\r\n  Diana and Nymphs: Giulio Romano.\r\n\r\n  Leda and Swan: Giulio Romano.\r\n\r\n  Venus Arranging her Hair: Andrea del Sarto.\r\n\r\n  Venus and Cupid: Andrea del Sarto.\r\n\r\n  Venus and Cupid: Palma Vecchio.\r\n\r\n  Lucretia: Andrea del Sarto.\r\n\r\n  Venus and Mars: Pietro de Cortona.\r\n\r\n  Rape of the Sabines: Polidore.\r\n\r\n  Leda and Swan: Canache.\r\n\r\n  Venus and Man Playing Guitar: Titian.\r\n\r\n  Susanna and Elders: Guercino.\r\n\r\n  Venus Sleeping--back exposed: Guercino.\r\n\r\n  Zulieka and Joseph: Domenichino.\r\n\r\n  Venus and Loves: Domenichino.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe drawings mentioned above, like most of the caricaturist's fluent\r\nrenderings of subjects after the Old Masters, are far removed from\r\nmere copies or servile imitations, being, in actual fact, free\r\nadaptations of the works in question, strongly characterised with the\r\nindividualities of Rowlandson's style.\r\n\r\nColonel Weston, in addition to this unique series, possesses a\r\ncollection of original drawings by the artist, which includes,\r\namong numerous interesting examples of varying importance, one of\r\nRowlandson's most graceful and finished drawings, worked out with a\r\ntaste and delicacy altogether remarkable. The subject is a domestic\r\nscene, introducing two charming figures (likenesses in all probability)\r\nexecuted after the style of the portrait of Morland (mentioned in the\r\nfirst part of this work, now in the Print Room, British Museum, see p.\r\n412), and evidently executed at the same period.\r\n\r\n\r\nORIGINAL DRAWINGS BY THOMAS ROWLANDSON.

Five peasants, admirably grouped,\r\n  seated on a sort of timber-cart, drawn by two oxen. Woody background.\r\n  Signed 'Rowlandson.'\r\n\r\n  Acis and Galatea. 8-1/2 × 6.\r\n\r\n  Apollo and Daphne. 8-1/2 × 6. Companion to the above. A\r\n  vigorously-drawn recollection of the antique.\r\n\r\n  The Cottage Door. 11-1/2 × 8-1/2. A group of rustics seated at the\r\n  door of a cottage. On the right hand a man with a donkey laden with\r\n  vegetables. In the manner of Morland.\r\n\r\n  'The Road to Ruin.' 13-1/2 × 9-1/2. The young squire is seated at a\r\n  round table, with his mistress on his knee. Opposite to him is a\r\n  'led-captain,' dealing out cards and inciting the squire to bet. In\r\n  the centre, standing at the table, is a plethoric chaplain, wholly\r\n  intent upon the manufacture of a bowl of punch, the ingredients for\r\n  which he is pouring simultaneously from two bottles into the bowl.\r\n  The complete absorption of each of these personages in his own\r\n  special object is admirably depicted.\r\n\r\n  Brentford Market Place. 17-1/2 × 12. An admirable drawing, exhibiting\r\n  hundreds of market-people disposed in groups, with the Town House in\r\n  the central background and the 'Three Kings' inn on the right hand.\r\n  The grouping is excellent, the scene full of animation and bustle,\r\n  the sense of space and general keeping perfect, and the whole equal\r\n  in power and effect to the works of the Dutch painters.\r\n\r\n  Shepherd and Sheep. 17-1/4 × 4-1/2. A standing figure in the middle of\r\n  a group of five sheep; something in the manner of Gainsborough.\r\n\r\n  The Funeral. 7 × 4-1/2. The parson advances, reading the burial\r\n  service. Next comes the clerk, carrying a child's coffin, and\r\n  followed by a group of female mourners, wringing their hands, holding\r\n  handkerchiefs to their eyes, and some carrying umbrellas. To the\r\n  right a female gravedigger, holding a spade in one hand and tolling\r\n  the bell with the other. To illustrate the old song of 'The Vicar and\r\n  Moses':--\r\n\r\n    When come to the grave the clerk humm'd a stave,\r\n      Whilst the surplice was wrapped round the priest;\r\n    When so droll was the figure of Moses and Vicar,\r\n      That the parish still laugh at the jest.\r\n                            Singing tol de rol, &c.\r\n\r\n  An Oriental Scene. 8-1/2 × 5-1/2. In the foreground a gibbet, from\r\n  which is hanging in chains the headless body of a woman. By the side\r\n  an impaling-stake and wheel. Two men in foreign garb are looking on.\r\n  In the distance a city, with towers and minarets.\r\n\r\n  'The Industrious Wife and Idle Husband.' 5-1/2 × 4. The wife is busily\r\n  engaged at the washtub; a cradle, with twins asleep, at her back;\r\n  while the husband, with pipe, glass, and jug, sits over the fire with\r\n  a boon companion. Full of Hogarthian humour.\r\n\r\n  Burglars Alarmed. 11 × 9-1/2. A drawing of extraordinary vigour. A\r\n  brutal-looking ruffian, in a frieze coat, holding a bloody knife in\r\n  one hand and enjoining attention with the other, is striding over the\r\n  corpses of two women, both with their throats cut. A second ruffian,\r\n  with alarm depicted on his countenance, holds a candle in his right\r\n  hand and grasps a bloodstained coal-hammer in his left. In the\r\n  background a fate is seen peeping through a window. A piece that can\r\n  hardly be looked at without a subsequent attack of nightmare.\r\n\r\n  Landscape. Lake scene, hilly background. 9 × 7. Very broad in\r\n  treatment.\r\n\r\n  Commodore Trunnion and Lieut. Hatchway on their way to the Wedding.\r\n  14-1/2 × 8. (See Smollett's 'Peregrine Pickle,' vol. i. chap. 8.)\r\n\r\n  Jolly Companions. 11 × 8. A group of five, heads and shoulders. A man\r\n  is apparently singing from a ballad-sheet. A woman at his right hand\r\n  is blowing with the bellows, and the other faces are on the broad\r\n  grin.\r\n\r\n  The Pipe Dance. 4-1/2 × 3. Two Punch-and-Judy-like figures dancing,\r\n  and holding a pipe over head. Small, but very spirited.\r\n\r\n  The Forge. 9-1/2 × 6-1/2. A group of four horses outside a forge. The\r\n  blacksmith holds up the hoof of one; the farmer stands by, and a\r\n  woman advances holding a cup of ale. Signed 'Rowlandson, 1791.' As\r\n  fine as Morland.\r\n\r\n  Maternal Solicitude. 6-1/2 × 4-3/4. A mother bends over her child on a\r\n  couch, both entirely nude.\r\n\r\n  Nymph and Cupid. 7-1/4 × 5-1/2. A naked nymph recumbent; a winged\r\n  cupid, bow in hand, descends towards her.\r\n\r\n  Henpecked Husbands. 10 × 6-1/4. A woman has hold of the greatly\r\n  elongated nose of her husband in one hand, and belabours him with a\r\n  whip in the other. On the left a group of women toss a husband in\r\n  a blanket, and on the right a wife is thrashing her husband on the\r\n  ground, whom she also holds by the nose.\r\n\r\n  Death in the Pot. 6 × 3-1/2. A plethoric figure drinks from a bowl,\r\n  while a skeleton figure is about to strike him from above.\r\n\r\n  Zion Chapel. 13-1/2 × 8-1/4. A congregation of over fifty persons,\r\n  who have just emerged from the portal of 'Zion Chaple' (_sic_),\r\n  are passing slowly along. The door is blocked up by the departing\r\n  worshippers; a fish-woman standing by indulges in some ribald\r\n  observations, and a pious old lady holds up her hands in horror.\r\n\r\n  The Table d'Hôte. 13-3/4 × 9. A spirited and characteristic drawing,\r\n  exhibiting a numerous company of both sexes seated at a dinner-table.\r\n  French waiters, pig-tailed and nightcapped, are drawing corks,\r\n  filling glasses, and flying to and fro with dishes, &c. One of the\r\n  guests is teaching a dog to beg; a woman and girl, with tambourine\r\n  and triangle, appear on the left to amuse the company.\r\n\r\n  Interior of a Prison. 9-1/2 × 6. From the collection of the celebrated\r\n  Henry Angelo, the professor of fencing, who in his 'Reminiscences'\r\n  (vol. ii. p. 324) gives an account of its production. Rowlandson,\r\n  it appears, had been robbed one night, and went next day in search\r\n  of the thief. 'We first repaired,' says the reminiscent, 'to St.\r\n  Giles's, Dyott Street, and Seven Dials. In one of the night-houses\r\n  four ill-looking fellows, _des coupes-jarret_, so attracted our\r\n  attention that, whilst we sat over our noggins of spirits, as he\r\n  (Rowlandson) always carried his sketch-book with him, he made an\r\n  excellent caricature group of them for me, introducing a prison in\r\n  the background.... He afterwards finished it for me in his best\r\n  style, superior to the greater part of his works. This is now (1830)\r\n  about forty years ago. The coloured drawing was once included in\r\n  my collection.' Here we have the four thieves sitting and lying in\r\n  various positions. Prisoners in another group are playing cards.\r\n  Another ruffian is stretched at full length asleep in the foreground.\r\n  The drawing, grouping, and colouring are alike admirable, and would\r\n  have done honour to Salvator Rosa.\r\n\r\n  'The Miser Lying in State: the Prodigal Heir-Apparent.' 14 × 9-1/2.\r\n  The 'heir-apparent,' with his profligate companions, male and female,\r\n  is seated at a table, on which we see a punchbowl, &c. A coffin\r\n  occupies an elevated position in the background, and from it appears\r\n  to be struggling to emerge the supposed defunct miser, while an\r\n  allegorical figure above seems to be nailing down the lid.\r\n\r\n  The Fire. 9-1/2 × 6. On the right a house on fire, flames issuing from\r\n  the windows, the doorway crowded with watermen, and persons carrying\r\n  out bedding and other effects. On the left firemen manipulating\r\n  the hose and directing the stream against the flaming windows,\r\n  in ridiculously suggestive attitudes. The central figure is an\r\n  enormously fat woman, whose night-dress, drawn up to support a mass\r\n  of crockery, displays her _Rubensesque_ and redundant charms to the\r\n  watermen, who turn their grinning faces to gaze upon the spectacle.\r\n\r\n  'Leaving the Premises without Consulting the Landlord.' 11 × 8-1/2.\r\n  A cart, seen at the back, heaped up with furniture, occupies the\r\n  centre. A woman on the left laden with gridirons, warming-pans, &c.\r\n  On the right a girl, graceful as one of Stothard's female figures,\r\n  places in the cart a birdcage. In the foreground miscellaneous\r\n  articles of minor furniture, and two children playing with the\r\n  house-cat.\r\n\r\n  Outside the Court-House. 14-1/2 × 10-1/2. The scene is apparently the\r\n  Magistrate's Court and the Town Hall in some county town. The ground\r\n  in front is crowded with various individuals waiting for the cases\r\n  in which they are interested to be called on. We see the farmer, the\r\n  parson, a jockey, a huntsman, a footman, a butcher, a soldier, an\r\n  actor, and many others. The beadle is seated on a step, making love\r\n  to an old woman, who holds a tankard in her hand. Dogs are scattered\r\n  about, attendant on their masters.\r\n\r\n  Interior of Eating-House. 7-1/4 × 5. A dining-table, at which are\r\n  seated some seventeen people, male and female. One of the guests, a\r\n  stout, portly man, has left the table, and is seizing his hat, as if\r\n  offended. A neighbour attempts to restrain him, while the waiters\r\n  appear amused.\r\n\r\n  Bridewell. 9 × 6. A procession of fifteen female prisoners are\r\n  escorted through the courtyard of Bridewell from one department\r\n  of the prison to another, in pairs, in charge of turnkeys, female\r\n  warders looking on. Penitence, grief, and hardened impudence are\r\n  admirably depicted on the several faces.\r\n\r\n  Returning from a Voyage. 9-1/2 × 6. A sea beach, with a schooner and\r\n  sloops at anchor. A boat has just landed a group of passengers, among\r\n  whom is a girl with a cockatoo on her wrist.\r\n\r\n  Pickaback. 4-1/2 × 3-1/2. A man, carrying a woman on his back, is\r\n  fording a brook.\r\n\r\n  Picture Exhibition. 9 × 5-1/2. Connoisseurs at an exhibition of\r\n  pictures.\r\n\r\n  Gaming House. 9 × 5-1/2. A drawing similar to that which serves as\r\n  frontispiece to the 'Beauties of Tom Brown.'\r\n\r\n  Nymphs Bathing. 8-1/4 × 5-1/4. Eight female figures, entirely nude,\r\n  sporting in a stream, or seated on its banks. Leafy background.\r\n\r\n  Nymphs Attiring. 8-1/4 × 5-1/4. Five female figures, entirely nude,\r\n  seated on the banks of a stream, dressing their hair.\r\n\r\n  The Village Politicians. 15 × 9-3/4. Dated 1821.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[29] _Vide_ Biography, vol. i. p. 67.\r\n\r\n[30] See account of the _Three Tours of Dr. Syntax_, _ante_, pp. 176,\r\n247-252.\r\n\r\n[31] Another version of the drawing, in the possession of the Editor,\r\nreproduced (p. 20) as 'The Quay,' in the introductory biographical\r\nsketch to this work.\r\n\r\n[32] Antiquity Smith, Author of the 'Life of Nollekens;' once Keeper of\r\nthe Prints and Drawings, British Museum, &c.\r\n\r\n[33] See _George Cruikshank: the Artist, the Humourist, and the Man,\r\nwith some account of his brother Robert.
