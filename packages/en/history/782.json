From 1499, when they were first printed by Wynkyn\r\nde Worde, the _Travels _had enjoyed great popularity in England, as in\r\nthe rest of Europe; but the printed editions before 1725 had all followed\r\nan inferior translation (with an unperceived gap in the middle of it),\r\nwhich had already gained the upper hand before printing was invented.\r\nAnother manuscript in the British Museum, belonging to the ‘Egerton’\r\ncollection, preserves yet a third version, and this was printed for the\r\nfirst time by Mr. G. F. Warner, for the Roxburghe Club, in 1889, together\r\nwith the original French text, and an introduction, and notes, which it\r\nwould be difficult to over-praise.  In editing the Egerton version, Mr.\r\nWarner made constant reference to the Cotton manuscript, which he quoted\r\nin many of his critical notes.  But with this exception, no one appears\r\nto have looked at the manuscript since it was first printed, and\r\nsubsequent writers have been content to take the correctness of the 1725\r\ntext for granted, priding themselves, apparently, on the care with which\r\nthey reproduced all the superfluous eighteenth century capitals with\r\nwhich every line is dotted.  Unluckily, the introduction of needless\r\ncapitals was the least of the original editor’s crimes, for he omits\r\nwords and phrases, and sometimes (a common trick with careless copyists)\r\na whole sentence or clause which happens to end with the same word as its\r\npredecessor.  He was also a deliberate as well as a careless criminal,\r\nfor the paragraph about the Arabic alphabet at the end of Chapter XV.\r\nbeing difficult to reproduce, he omitted it altogether, and not only\r\nthis, but the last sentence of Chapter XVI. as well, because it contained\r\na reference to it.\r\n\r\nThat it has been left to the editor (who has hitherto rather avoided that\r\nname) of a series of popular reprints to restore whole phrases and\r\nsentences to the text of a famous book is not very creditable to English\r\nscholarship, and amounts, indeed, to a personal grievance; for to produce\r\nan easily readable text of an old book without a good critical edition to\r\nwork on must always be difficult, while in the case of a work with the\r\npeculiar reputation of ‘Mandeville’ the difficulty is greatly increased.\r\nHad a critical edition existed, it would have been permissible for a\r\npopular text to botch the few sentences in which the tail does not agree\r\nwith the beginning, and to correct obvious mistranslation without special\r\nnote.  But ‘Mandeville’ has an old reputation as the ‘Father of English\r\nProse,’ and when no trustworthy text is available, even a popular editor\r\nmust be careful lest he bear false witness.  The Cotton version is,\r\ntherefore, here reproduced, ‘warts and all,’ save in less than a dozen\r\ninstances, where a dagger indicates that, to avoid printing nonsense, an\r\nobvious flaw has been corrected either from the ‘Egerton’ manuscript or\r\nthe French text.  When a word still survives, the modern form is adopted:\r\nthus ‘Armenia’ and ‘soldiers’ are here printed instead of ‘Ermony’ and\r\n‘soudiours.’  But a new word is never substituted for an old one, and the\r\nreader who is unfamiliar with obsolete words, such as ‘Almayne’ (Germany)\r\nor ‘dere’ (harm),—there are surprisingly few for a book written five\r\ncenturies ago,—must consult the unpretentious glossary.  Of previous\r\neditions, that of 1725 and the reprints of it, including those of\r\nHalliwell-Phillipps, profess, though they do not do so, to reproduce the\r\nmanuscript exactly.  Thomas Wright’s edition is really a translation, and\r\nthat issued in 1895 by Mr. Arthur Layard often comes near to being one,\r\nthough the artist-editor has shown far more feeling for the old text than\r\nhis too whimsical illustrations might lead one to expect.  It is hoped\r\nthat the plan here adopted preserves as much as possible of the\r\nfourteenth century flavour, with the minimum of disturbance to the modern\r\nreader’s enjoyment.\r\n\r\nThe plan of this series forbids the introduction of critical\r\ndisquisitions, and I am thus absolved from attempting any theory as to\r\nhow the tangled web of the authorship of the book should be unravelled.\r\nThe simple faith of our childhood in a Sir John Mandeville, really born\r\nat St. Albans, who travelled, and told in an English book what he saw and\r\nheard, is shattered to pieces.  We now know that our Mandeville is a\r\ncompilation, as clever and artistic as Malory’s ‘Morte d’Arthur,’ from\r\nthe works of earlier writers, with few, if any, touches added from\r\npersonal experience; that it was written in French, and rendered into\r\nLatin before it attracted the notice of a series of English translators\r\n(whose own accounts of the work they were translating are not to be\r\ntrusted), and that the name Sir John Mandeville was a _nom de guerre\r\n_borrowed from a real knight of this name who lived in the reign of\r\nEdward II.  Beyond this it is difficult to unravel the knot, despite the\r\nends which lie temptingly loose.  A Liège chronicler, Jean d’Outremeuse,\r\ntells a story of a certain Jean de Bourgogne revealing on his deathbed\r\nthat his real name was Sir John Mandeville; and in accordance with this\r\nstory there is authentic record of a funeral inscription to a Sir John\r\nMandeville in a church at Liège.  Jean de Bourgogne had written other\r\nbooks and had been in England, which he had left in 1322 (the year in\r\nwhich “Mandeville” began his travels), being then implicated in killing a\r\nnobleman, just, as the real Sir John Mandeville had been implicated ten\r\nyears before in the death of the Earl of Cornwall.  We think for a moment\r\nthat we have an explanation of the whole mystery in imagining that Jean\r\nde Bourgogne (he was also called Jean à_ _la Barbe, Joannes Barbatus) had\r\nchosen to father his compilation on Mandeville, and eventually merged his\r\nown identity in that of his pseudonym.  But Jean d’Outremeuse, the\r\nrecipient of his deathbed confidence, is a tricky witness, who may have\r\nhad a hand in the authorship himself, and there is no clear story as yet\r\nforthcoming.  But the book remains, and is none the less delightful for\r\nthe mystery which attaches to it, and little less important in the\r\nhistory of English literature as a translation than as an original work.\r\nFor though a translation it stands as the first, or almost the first,\r\nattempt to bring secular subjects within the domain of English prose, and\r\nthat is enough to make it mark an epoch.\r\n\r\nMandeville is here reprinted rather as a source of literary pleasure than\r\nas a medieval contribution to geography, and it is therefore no part of\r\nour duty to follow Mr. Warner in tracking out the authorities to whom the\r\ncompiler had recourse in successive chapters.  But as there was some\r\nspace in this volume to spare, and a very pleasant method of filling it\r\nsuggested itself, a threefold supplement is here printed, {0} which may\r\nbe of some use even to serious students, and is certainly very good\r\nliterature.  When Richard Hakluyt, at the end of the sixteenth century,\r\nwas compiling his admirable work, ‘The Principall Navigations, Voiages,\r\nand Discoveries of the English Nation, made by sea or over land, within\r\nthe compasse of these 1500_ _yeeres,’ he boldly overstepped the limits\r\nset forth on his title-page, and printed in the original Latin, with\r\ntranslations into good Elizabethan English, the narratives of three of\r\nthe earlier travellers, all of them foreigners, from whom the compiler of\r\nMandeville had drawn most freely.  “And because,” he tells us, “these\r\nnorth-eastern regions beyond Volga, by reason of the huge deserts, the\r\ncold climate, and the barbarous incivilitie of the people there\r\ninhabiting, were never yet thoroughly travelled by any of our Nation, nor\r\nsufficiently known unto us; I have here annexed unto the said\r\nEnglishman’s {ix} traveils the rare and memorable journals of two friers\r\nwho were some of the first Christians that travailed farthest that way,\r\nand brought home most particular intelligence of all things which they\r\nhad seen.”  These two friars were John de Plano Carpini, sent on an\r\nembassy to the great Chan by Pope Innocent IV. in 1246, and William de\r\nRubruquis, who travelled in the interests of Louis IX. of France in 1253.\r\nIn the same way in his Second Part, Hakluyt adds ‘The Voyage of Frier\r\nBeatus Odoricus to Asia Minor, Armenia, Chaldaea, Persia, India, China,\r\nand other remote parts,’ Odoric being a Franciscan of Pordenone in North\r\nItaly, who dictated an account of his travels in 1330.  Anyone who\r\ncompares these three narratives (more particularly Odoric’s) with\r\nMandeville’s Travels will see how the compiler used his materials, and\r\nthey have also very considerable interest of their own.\r\n\r\nAs this volume of the Library of English Classics has brought with it an\r\nunusual editorial responsibility, I may be permitted an editor’s\r\nprivilege in making two acknowledgments.  The first, to my friend Mr. G.\r\nF. Warner, my readers must share with me, for without the help of his\r\nsplendid edition of the ‘Egerton’ version and the French text, the\r\npopular ‘Mandeville’ could not have been attempted.  My second\r\nacknowledgment is of a more personal nature.  Roxburghe Club books are\r\nnever easy to obtain, and the few copies of the Mandeville allowed to be\r\nsold were priced at £20 each.  In noticing Mr. Warner’s edition in the\r\n‘Academy’ (from a borrowed copy), I remarked rather ruefully that the\r\ngratitude which students of moderate means could feel towards the Club\r\nfor printing so valuable a work was somewhat tempered by this little\r\nmatter of the price.  I was then helping Mr. Charles Elton with the\r\ncatalogue of his library, and on reading my review, he wrote me a pretty\r\nletter to say that by the rules of the Club he was the possessor of a\r\nsecond copy, and that he thought I was the best person to give it to.\r\nStudents who have to think a good many times before they spend £20 on a\r\nbook do not often receive such a present from wealthy book-lovers; and at\r\nthe risk of obtruding more of my own concerns than my rough-and-ready\r\nediting entitles me to do, I cannot send out this ‘Mandeville,’ within a\r\nfew weeks of Mr. Elton’s too early death, without telling this little\r\nstory of his kindness.\r\n\r\n                                                            A.

Of the Customs of Kings and other that dwell          202\r\n             in the Isles coasting to Prester John’s Land.\r\n             And of the Worship that the Son doth to the\r\n             Father when he is dead,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PROLOGUE\r\n\r\n\r\nFOR as much as the land beyond the sea, that is to say the Holy Land,\r\nthat men call the Land of Promission or of Behest, passing all other\r\nlands, is the most worthy land, most excellent, and lady and sovereign of\r\nall other lands, and is blessed and hallowed of the precious body and\r\nblood of our Lord Jesu Christ; in the which land it liked him to take\r\nflesh and blood of the Virgin Mary, to environ that holy land with his\r\nblessed feet; and there he would of his blessedness enombre him in the\r\nsaid blessed and glorious Virgin Mary, and become man, and work many\r\nmiracles, and preach and teach the faith and the law of Christian men\r\nunto his children; and there it liked him to suffer many reprovings and\r\nscorns for us; and he that was king of heaven, of air, of earth, of sea\r\nand of all things that be contained in them, would all only be clept king\r\nof that land, when he said, _Rex sum Judeorum_, that is to say, ‘I am\r\nKing of Jews’; and that land he chose before all other lands, as the best\r\nand most worthy land, and the most virtuous land of all the world: for it\r\nis the heart and the midst of all the world, witnessing the philosopher,\r\nthat saith thus, _Virtus rerum in medio consistit_, that is to say, ‘The\r\nvirtue of things is in the midst’; and in that land he would lead his\r\nlife, and suffer passion and death of Jews, for us, to buy and to deliver\r\nus from pains of hell, and from death without end; the which was ordained\r\nfor us, for the sin of our forme-father Adam, and for our own sins also;\r\nfor as for himself, he had no evil deserved: for he thought never evil ne\r\ndid evil: and he that was king of glory and of joy, might best in that\r\nplace suffer death; because he chose in that land rather than in any\r\nother, there to suffer his passion and his death.  For he that will\r\npublish anything to make it openly known, he will make it to be cried and\r\npronounced in the middle place of a town; so that the thing that is\r\nproclaimed and pronounced, may evenly stretch to all parts: right so, he\r\nthat was former of all the world, would suffer for us at Jerusalem, that\r\nis the midst of the world; to that end and intent, that his passion and\r\nhis death, that was published there, might be known evenly to all parts\r\nof the world.\r\n\r\nSee now, how dear he bought man, that he made after his own image, and\r\nhow dear he again-bought us, for the great love that he had to us, and we\r\nnever deserved it to him.  For more precious chattel ne greater ransom ne\r\nmight he put for us, than his blessed body, his precious blood, and his\r\nholy life, that he thralled for us; and all he offered for us that never\r\ndid sin.\r\n\r\nAh dear God!  What love had he to us his subjects, when he that never\r\ntrespassed, would for trespassers suffer death!  Right well ought us for\r\nto love and worship, to dread and serve such a Lord; and to worship and\r\npraise such an holy land, that brought forth such fruit, through the\r\nwhich every man is saved, but it be his own default.  Well may that land\r\nbe called delectable and a fructuous land, that was be-bled and moisted\r\nwith the precious blood of our Lord Jesu Christ; the which is the same\r\nland that our Lord behight us in heritage.  And in that land he would\r\ndie, as seised, to leave it to us, his children.\r\n\r\nWherefore every good Christian man, that is of power, and hath whereof,\r\nshould pain him with all his strength for to conquer our right heritage,\r\nand chase out all the misbelieving men.  For we be clept Christian men,\r\nafter Christ our Father.  And if we be right children of Christ, we ought\r\nfor to challenge the heritage, that our Father left us, and do it out of\r\nheathen men’s hands.  But now pride, covetise, and envy have so inflamed\r\nthe hearts of lords of the world, that they are more busy for to\r\ndis-herit their neighbours, more than for to challenge or to conquer\r\ntheir right heritage before-said.  And the common people, that would put\r\ntheir bodies and their chattels, to conquer our heritage, they may not do\r\nit without the lords.  For a sembly of people without a chieftain, or a\r\nchief lord, is as a flock of sheep without a shepherd; the which\r\ndeparteth and disperpleth and wit never whither to go.  But would God,\r\nthat the temporal lords and all worldly lords were at good accord, and\r\nwith the common people would take this holy voyage over the sea!  Then I\r\ntrow well, that within a little time, our right heritage before-said\r\nshould be reconciled and put in the hands of the right heirs of Jesu\r\nChrist.\r\n\r\nAnd, for as much as it is long time passed, that there was no general\r\npassage ne voyage over the sea; and many men desire for to hear speak of\r\nthe Holy Land, and have thereof great solace and comfort; I, John\r\nMandeville, Knight, albeit I be not worthy, that was born in England, in\r\nthe town of St. Albans, and passed the sea in the year of our Lord Jesu\r\nChrist, 1322, in the day of St. Michael; and hitherto been long time over\r\nthe sea, and have seen and gone through many diverse lands, and many\r\nprovinces and kingdoms and isles and have passed throughout Turkey,\r\nArmenia the little and the great; through Tartary, Persia, Syria, Arabia,\r\nEgypt the high and the low; through Lybia, Chaldea, and a great part of\r\nEthiopia; through Amazonia, Ind the less and the more, a great part; and\r\nthroughout many other Isles, that be about Ind; where dwell many diverse\r\nfolks, and of diverse manners and laws, and of diverse shapes of men.  Of\r\nwhich lands and isles I shall speak more plainly hereafter; and I shall\r\ndevise you of some part of things that there be, when time shall be,\r\nafter it may best come to my mind; and specially for them, that will and\r\nare in purpose for to visit the Holy City of Jerusalem and the holy\r\nplaces that are thereabout.  And I shall tell the way that they shall\r\nhold thither.  For I have often times passed and ridden that way, with\r\ngood company of many lords.  God be thanked!\r\n\r\nAnd ye shall understand, that I have put this book out of Latin into\r\nFrench, and translated it again out of French into English, that every\r\nman of my nation may understand it.  But lords and knights and other\r\nnoble and worthy men that con Latin but little, and have been beyond the\r\nsea, know and understand, if I say truth or no, and if I err in devising,\r\nfor forgetting or else, that they may redress it and amend it.  For\r\nthings passed out of long time from a man’s mind or from his sight, turn\r\nsoon into forgetting; because that mind of man ne may not be comprehended\r\nne withholden, for the frailty of mankind.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I\r\n\r\n\r\n         _To teach you the Way out of England to Constantinople_\r\n\r\nIN the name of God, Glorious and Almighty!\r\n\r\nHe that will pass over the sea and come to land [to go to the city of\r\nJerusalem, he may wend many ways, both on sea and land], after the\r\ncountry that he cometh from; [for] many of them come to one end.  But\r\ntroweth not that I will tell you all the towns, and cities and castles\r\nthat men shall go by; for then should I make too long a tale; but all\r\nonly some countries and most principal steads that men shall go through\r\nto go the right way.\r\n\r\nFirst, if a man come from the west side of the world, as England,\r\nIreland, Wales, Scotland, or Norway, he may, if that he will, go through\r\nAlmayne and through the kingdom of Hungary, that marcheth to the land of\r\nPolayne, and to the land of Pannonia, and so to Silesia.\r\n\r\nAnd the King of Hungary is a great lord and a mighty, and holdeth great\r\nlordships and much land in his hand.  For he holdeth the kingdom of\r\nHungary, Sclavonia, and of Comania a great part, and of Bulgaria that men\r\ncall the land of Bougiers, and of the realm of Russia a great part,\r\nwhereof he hath made a duchy, that lasteth unto the land of Nyfland, and\r\nmarcheth to Prussia.  And men go through the land of this lord, through a\r\ncity that is clept Cypron, and by the castle of Neasburghe, and by the\r\nevil town, that sit toward the end of Hungary.  And there pass men the\r\nriver of Danube.  This river of Danube is a full great river, and it\r\ngoeth into Almayne, under the hills of Lombardy, and it receiveth into\r\nhim forty other rivers, and it runneth through Hungary and through Greece\r\nand through Thrace, and it entereth into the sea, toward the east so\r\nrudely and so sharply, that the water of the sea is fresh and holdeth his\r\nsweetness twenty mile within the sea.\r\n\r\nAnd after, go men to Belgrade, and enter into the land of Bougiers; and\r\nthere pass men a bridge of stone that is upon the river of Marrok.  And\r\nmen pass through the land of Pyncemartz and come to Greece to the city of\r\nNye, and to the city of Fynepape, and after to the city of Dandrenoble,\r\nand after to Constantinople, that was wont to be clept Bezanzon.  And\r\nthere dwelleth commonly the Emperor of Greece.  And there is the most\r\nfair church and the most noble of all the world; and it is of Saint\r\nSophie.  And before that church is the image of Justinian the emperor,\r\ncovered with gold, and he sitteth upon an horse y-crowned.  And he was\r\nwont to hold a round apple of gold in his hand: but it is fallen out\r\nthereof.  And men say there, that it is a token that the emperor hath\r\nlost a great part of his lands and of his lordships; for he was wont to\r\nbe Emperor of Roumania and of Greece, of all Asia the less, and of the\r\nland of Syria, of the land of Judea in the which is Jerusalem, and of the\r\nland of Egypt, of Persia, and of Arabia.  But he hath lost all but\r\nGreece; and that land he holds all only.  And men would many times put\r\nthe apple into the image’s hand again, but it will not hold it.  This\r\napple betokeneth the lordship that he had over all the world, that is\r\nround.  And the tother hand he lifteth up against the East, in token to\r\nmenace the misdoers.  This image stands upon a pillar of marble at\r\nConstantinople.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\n\r\n           _Of the Cross and the Crown of our Lord Jesu Christ_\r\n\r\nAT Constantinople is the cross of our Lord Jesu Christ, and his coat\r\nwithout seams, that is clept _Tunica inconsutilis_, and the sponge, and\r\nthe reed, of the which the Jews gave our Lord eysell and gall, in the\r\ncross.  And there is one of the nails, that Christ was nailed with on the\r\ncross.\r\n\r\nAnd some men trow that half the cross, that Christ was done on, be in\r\nCyprus, in an abbey of monks, that men call the Hill of the Holy Cross;\r\nbut it is not so.  For that cross that is in Cyprus, is the cross, in the\r\nwhich Dismas the good thief was hanged on.  But all men know not that;\r\nand that is evil y-done.  For for profit of the offering, they say that\r\nit is the cross of our Lord Jesu Christ.\r\n\r\nAnd ye shall understand that the cross of our Lord was made of four\r\nmanner of trees, as it is contained in this verse,—_In cruce fit palma_,\r\n_cedrus_, _cypressus_, _oliva_.  For that piece that went upright from\r\nthe earth to the head was of cypress; and the piece that went overthwart,\r\nto the which his hands were nailed, was of palm; and the stock, that\r\nstood within the earth, in the which was made the mortise, was of cedar;\r\nand the table above his head, that was a foot and an half long, on the\r\nwhich the title was written in Hebrew, Greek and Latin, that was of\r\nolive.\r\n\r\nAnd the Jews made the cross of these four manner of trees; for they\r\ntrowed that our Lord Jesu Christ should have hanged on the cross, as long\r\nas the cross might last.  And therefore made they the foot of the cross\r\nof cedar; for cedar may not, in earth nor water, rot, and therefore they\r\nwould that it should have lasted long.  For they trowed that the body of\r\nChrist should have stunken, they made that piece, that went from the\r\nearth upwards of cypress, for it is well-smelling, so that the smell of\r\nhis body should not grieve men that went forby.  And the overthwart piece\r\nwas of palm, for in the Old Testament it was ordained, that when one was\r\novercome he should be crowned with palm; and for they trowed that they\r\nhad the victory of Christ Jesus, therefore made they the overthwart piece\r\nof palm.  And the table of the title they made of olive; for olive\r\nbetokeneth peace, as the story of Noe witnesseth; when that the culver\r\nbrought the branch of olive, that betokened peace made between God and\r\nman.  And so trowed the Jews for to have peace, when Christ was dead; for\r\nthey said that he made discord and strife amongst them.  And ye shall\r\nunderstand that our Lord was y-nailed on the cross lying, and therefore\r\nhe suffered the more pain.\r\n\r\nAnd the Christian men, that dwell beyond the sea, in Greece, say that the\r\ntree of the cross, that we call cypress, was of that tree that Adam ate\r\nthe apple off; and that find they written.  And they say also, that their\r\nscripture saith, that Adam was sick, and said to his son Seth, that he\r\nshould go to the angel that kept Paradise, that he would send him oil of\r\nmercy, for to anoint with his members, that he might have health.  And\r\nSeth went.  But the angel would not let him come in; but said to him,\r\nthat he might not have of the oil of mercy.  But he took him three grains\r\nof the same tree, that his father ate the apple off; and bade him, as\r\nsoon as his father was dead, that he should put these three grains under\r\nhis tongue, and grave him so: and so he did.  And of these three grains\r\nsprang a tree, as the angel said that it should, and bare a fruit,\r\nthrough the which fruit Adam should be saved.  And when Seth came again,\r\nhe found his father near dead.  And when he was dead, he did with the\r\ngrains as the angel bade him; of the which sprung three trees, of the\r\nwhich the cross was made, that bare good fruit and blessed, our Lord Jesu\r\nChrist; through whom, Adam and all that come of him, should be saved and\r\ndelivered from dread of death without end, but it be their own default.\r\n\r\nThis holy cross had the Jews hid in the earth, under a rock of the mount\r\nof Calvary; and it lay there two hundred year and more, into the time\r\nthat St. Helen, that was mother to Constantine the Emperor of Rome.  And\r\nshe was daughter of King Coel, born in Colchester, that was King of\r\nEngland, that was clept then Britain the more; the which the Emperor\r\nConstance wedded to his wife, for her beauty, and gat upon her\r\nConstantine, that was after Emperor of Rome, and King of England.\r\n\r\nAnd ye shall understand, that the cross of our Lord was eight cubits\r\nlong, and the overthwart piece was of length three cubits and a half.\r\nAnd one part of the crown of our Lord, wherewith he was crowned, and one\r\nof the nails, and the spear head, and many other relics be in France, in\r\nthe king’s chapel.  And the crown lieth in a vessel of crystal richly\r\ndight.  For a king of France bought these relics some time of the Jews,\r\nto whom the emperor had laid them in wed for a great sum of silver.\r\n\r\nAnd if all it be so, that men say, that this crown is of thorns, ye shall\r\nunderstand, that it was of jonkes of the sea, that is to say, rushes of\r\nthe sea, that prick as sharply as thorns.  For I have seen and beholden\r\nmany times that of Paris and that of Constantinople; for they were both\r\none, made of rushes of the sea.  But men have departed them in two parts:\r\nof the which, one part is at Paris, and the other part is at\r\nConstantinople.  And I have one of those precious thorns, that seemeth\r\nlike a white thorn; and that was given to me for great specially.  For\r\nthere are many of them broken and fallen into the vessel that the crown\r\nlieth in; for they break for dryness when men move them to show them to\r\ngreat lords that come thither.\r\n\r\nAnd ye shall understand, that our Lord Jesu, in that night that he was\r\ntaken, he was led into a garden; and there he was first examined right\r\nsharply; and there the Jews scorned him, and made him a crown of the\r\nbranches of albespine, that is white thorn, that grew in that same\r\ngarden, and set it on his head, so fast and so sore, that the blood ran\r\ndown by many places of his visage, and of his neck, and of his shoulders.\r\nAnd therefore hath the white thorn many virtues, for he that beareth a\r\nbranch on him thereof, no thunder ne no manner of tempest may dere him;\r\nnor in the house, that it is in, may no evil ghost enter nor come unto\r\nthe place that it is in.  And in that same garden, Saint Peter denied our\r\nLord thrice.\r\n\r\nAfterward was our Lord led forth before the bishops and the masters of\r\nthe law, into another garden of Annas; and there also he was examined,\r\nreproved, and scorned, and crowned eft with a sweet thorn, that men\r\nclepeth barbarines, that grew in that garden, and that hath also many\r\nvirtues.\r\n\r\nAnd afterward he was led into a garden of Caiphas, and there he was\r\ncrowned with eglantine.\r\n\r\nAnd after he was led into the chamber of Pilate, and there he was\r\nexamined and crowned.  And the Jews set him in a chair, and clad him in a\r\nmantle; and there made they the crown of jonkes of the sea; and there\r\nthey kneeled to him, and scorned him, saying, _Ave_, _Rex Judeorum_! that\r\nis to say, ‘Hail, King of Jews!’  And of this crown, half is at Paris,\r\nand the other half at Constantinople.  And this crown had Christ on his\r\nhead, when he was done upon the cross; and therefore ought men to worship\r\nit and hold it more worthy than any of the others.\r\n\r\nAnd the spear shaft hath the Emperor of Almayne; but the head is at\r\nParis.  And natheles the Emperor of Constantinople saith that he hath the\r\nspear head; and I have often time seen it, but it is greater than that at\r\nParis.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\n\r\n      _Of the City of Constantinople_, _and of the Faith of Greeks_\r\n\r\nAT Constantinople lieth Saint Anne, our Lady’s mother, whom Saint Helen\r\nlet bring from Jerusalem.  And there lieth also the body of John\r\nChrisostome, that was Archbishop of Constantinople.  And there lieth also\r\nSaint Luke the Evangelist: for his bones were brought from Bethany, where\r\nhe was buried.  And many other relics be there.  And there is the vessel\r\nof stone, as it were of marble, that men clepe enydros, that evermore\r\ndroppeth water, and filleth himself every year, till that it go over\r\nabove, without that that men take from within.\r\n\r\nConstantinople is a full fair city, and a good, and well walled; and it\r\nis three-cornered.  And there is an arm of the sea Hellespont: and some\r\nmen call it the Mouth of Constantinople; and some men call it the Brace\r\nof Saint George: and that arm closeth the two parts of the city.  And\r\nupward to the sea, upon the water, was wont to be the great city of Troy,\r\nin a full fair plain: but that city was destroyed by them of Greece, and\r\nlittle appeareth thereof, because it is so long sith it was destroyed.\r\n\r\nAbout Greece there be many isles, as Calliste, Calcas, Oertige, Tesbria,\r\nMynia, Flaxon, Melo, Carpate, and Lemnos.  And in this isle is the mount\r\nAthos, that passeth the clouds.  And there be many diverse languages and\r\nmany countries, that be obedient to the emperor; that is to say,\r\nTurcople, Pyncynard, Comange, and many other, as Thrace and Macedonia, of\r\nthe which Alexander was king.  In this country was Aristotle born, in a\r\ncity that men clepe Stagyra, a little from the city of Thrace.  And at\r\nStagyra lieth Aristotle; and there is an altar upon his tomb.  And there\r\nmake men great feasts for him every year, as though he were a saint.  And\r\nat his altar they holden their great councils and their assemblies, and\r\nthey hope, that through inspiration of God and of him, they shall have\r\nthe better council.\r\n\r\nIn this country be right high hills, toward the end of Macedonia.  And\r\nthere is a great hill, that men clepe Olympus, that departeth Macedonia\r\nand Thrace.  And it is so high, that it passeth the clouds.  And there is\r\nanother hill, that is clept Athos, that is so high, that the shadow of\r\nhim reacheth to Lemne, that is an isle; and it is seventy-six mile\r\nbetween.  And above at the cop of the hill is the air so clear, that men\r\nmay find no wind there, and therefore may no beast live there, so is the\r\nair dry.\r\n\r\nAnd men say in these countries, that philosophers some time went upon\r\nthese hills, and held to their nose a sponge moisted with water, for to\r\nhave air; for the air above was so dry.  And above, in the dust and in\r\nthe powder of those hills, they wrote letters and figures with their\r\nfingers.  And at the year’s end they came again, and found the same\r\nletters and figures, the which they had written the year before, without\r\nany default.  And therefore it seemeth well, that these hills pass the\r\nclouds and join to the pure air.\r\n\r\nAt Constantinople is the palace of the emperor, right fair and\r\nwell-dight: and therein is a fair place for joustings, or for other plays\r\nand desports.  And it is made with stages, and hath degrees about, that\r\nevery man may well see, and none grieve other.  And under these stages be\r\nstables well vaulted for the emperor’s horses; and all the pillars be of\r\nmarble.\r\n\r\nAnd within the Church of Saint Sophia, an emperor sometime would have\r\nburied the body of his father, when he was dead.  And, as they made the\r\ngrave, they found a body in the earth, and upon the body lay a fine plate\r\nof gold; and thereon was written, in Hebrew, Greek, and Latin, letters\r\nthat said thus; _Jesu Christus nascetur de Virgine Maria_, _et ego credo\r\nin eum_; that is to say, ‘Jesu Christ shall be born of the Virgin Mary,\r\nand I trow in him.’  And the date when it was laid in the earth, was two\r\nthousand year before our Lord was born.  And yet is the plate of gold in\r\nthe treasury of the church.  And men say, that it was Hermogenes the wise\r\nman.\r\n\r\nAnd if all it so be, that men of Greece be Christian yet they vary from\r\nour faith.  For they say, that the Holy Ghost may not come of the Son;\r\nbut all only of the Father.  And they are not obedient to the Church of\r\nRome, ne to the Pope.  And they say that their Patriarch hath as much\r\npower over the sea, as the Pope hath on this side the sea.  And therefore\r\nPope John xxii. sent letters to them, how Christian faith should be all\r\none; and that they should be obedient to the Pope, that is God’s Vicar on\r\nearth, to whom God gave his plein power for to bind and to assoil, and\r\ntherefore they should be obedient to him.\r\n\r\nAnd they sent again diverse answers; and among others they said thus:\r\n_Potentiam tuam summam circa tuos subjectos_, _firmiter credimus_.\r\n_Superbiam tuam summam tolerare non possumus_.  _Avaritiam tuam summam\r\nsatiare non intendimus_.  _Dominus tecum_; _quia Dominus nobiscum est_.\r\nThat is to say: ‘We trow well, that thy power is great upon thy subjects.\r\nWe may not suffer thine high pride.  We be not in purpose to fulfil thy\r\ngreat covetise.  Lord be with thee; for our Lord is with us.  Farewell.’\r\nAnd other answer might he not have of them.\r\n\r\nAnd also they make their sacrament of the altar of Therf bread, for our\r\nLord made it of such bread, when he made his Maundy.  And on the\r\nShere-Thursday make they their Therf bread, in token of the Maundy, and\r\ndry it at the sun, and keep it all the year, and give it to sick men,\r\ninstead of God’s body.  And they make but one unction, when they christen\r\nchildren.  And they anoint not the sick men.  And they say that there is\r\nno Purgatory, and that souls shall not have neither joy ne pain till the\r\nday of doom.  And they say that fornication is no sin deadly, but a thing\r\nthat is kindly, and that men and women should not wed but once, and whoso\r\nweddeth oftener than once, their children be bastards and gotten in sin.\r\nAnd their priests also be wedded.\r\n\r\nAnd they say also that usury is no deadly sin.  And they sell benefices\r\nof Holy Church.  And so do men in other places: God amend it when his\r\nwill is!  And that is great sclaundre, for now is simony king crowned in\r\nHoly Church: God amend it for his mercy!\r\n\r\nAnd they say, that in Lent, men shall not fast, ne sing Mass, but on the\r\nSaturday and on the Sunday.  And they fast not on the Saturday, no time\r\nof the year, but it be Christmas Even or Easter Even.  And they suffer\r\nnot the Latins to sing at their altars; and if they do, by any adventure,\r\nanon they wash the altar with holy water.  And they say that there should\r\nbe but one Mass said at one altar upon one day.\r\n\r\nAnd they say also that our Lord ne ate never meat; but he made token of\r\neating.  And also they say, that we sin deadly in shaving our beards, for\r\nthe beard is token of a man, and gift of our Lord.  And they say that we\r\nsin deadly in eating of beasts that were forbidden in the Old Testament,\r\nand of the old Law, as swine, hares and other beasts, that chew not their\r\ncud.  And they say that we sin, when we eat flesh on the days before Ash\r\nWednesday, and of that that we eat flesh the Wednesday, and eggs and\r\ncheese upon the Fridays.  And they accurse all those that abstain them to\r\neat flesh the Saturday.\r\n\r\nAlso the Emperor of Constantinople maketh the patriarch, the archbishops\r\nand the bishops; and giveth the dignities and the benefices of churches\r\nand depriveth them that be unworthy, when he findeth any cause.  And so\r\nis he lord both temporal and spiritual in his country.\r\n\r\nAnd if ye will wit of their A.B.C. what letters they be, here ye may see\r\nthem, with the names that they clepe them there amongst them: Alpha,\r\nBetha, Gama, Deltha, εlonge, ε brevis, Epilmon, Thetha, Iota, Kapda,\r\nLapda, Mi, Ni, Xi, ο brevis, Pi, Coph, Ro, Summa, Tau, Vi, Fy, Chi, Psi,\r\nOthomega, Diacosyn.\r\n\r\nAnd all be it that these things touch not to one way, nevertheless they\r\ntouch to that, that I have hight you, to shew you a part of customs and\r\nmanners, and diversities of countries.  And for this is the first country\r\nthat is discordant in faith and in belief, and varieth from our faith, on\r\nthis half the sea, therefore I have set it here, that ye may know the\r\ndiversity that is between our faith and theirs.  For many men have great\r\nliking, to hear speak of strange things of diverse countries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\n\r\n[_Of the Way from Constantinople to Jerusalem_.]  _Of Saint John the\r\nEvangelist_.  _And of the Ypocras Daughter_, _transformed from a Woman to\r\na Dragon_\r\n\r\nNOW return I again, for to teach you the way from Constantinople to\r\nJerusalem.  He that will through Turkey, he goeth toward the city of\r\nNyke, and passeth through the gate of Chienetout, and always men see\r\nbefore them the hill of Chienetout, that is right high; and it is a mile\r\nand an half from Nyke.\r\n\r\nAnd whoso will go by water, by the brace of St. George, and by the sea\r\nwhere St. Nicholas lieth, and toward many other places—first men go to an\r\nisle that is clept Sylo.  In that isle groweth mastick on small trees,\r\nand out of them cometh gum as it were of plum-trees or of cherry-trees.\r\n\r\nAnd after go men through the isle of Patmos; and there wrote St. John the\r\nEvangelist the Apocalypse.  And ye shall understand, that St. John was of\r\nage thirty-two year, when our Lord suffered his passion; and after his\r\npassion, he lived sixty-seven year, and in the hundredth year of his age\r\nhe died.\r\n\r\nFrom Patmos men go unto Ephesus, a fair city and nigh to the sea.  And\r\nthere died St. John, and was buried behind the high altar in a tomb.  And\r\nthere is a fair church; for Christian men were wont to holden that place\r\nalways.  And in the tomb of St. John is nought but manna, that is clept\r\nangels’ meat; for his body was translated into Paradise.  And Turks hold\r\nnow all that place, and the city and the church; and all Asia the less is\r\ny-clept Turkey.  And ye shall understand, that St. John let make his\r\ngrave there in his life, and laid himself therein all quick; and\r\ntherefore some men say, that he died not, but that he resteth there till\r\nthe day of doom.  And, forsooth, there is a great marvel; for men may see\r\nthere the earth of the tomb apertly many times stir and move, as there\r\nwere quick things under.\r\n\r\nAnd from Ephesus men go through many isles in the sea, unto the city of\r\nPatera, where St. Nicholas was born, and so to Martha, where he was\r\nchosen to be bishop; and there groweth right good wine and strong, and\r\nthat men call wine of Martha.  And from thence go men to the isle of\r\nCrete, that the emperor gave sometime to [the] Genoese.\r\n\r\nAnd then pass men through the isles of Colcos and of Lango, of the which\r\nisles Ypocras was lord of.  And some men say, that in the isle of Lango\r\nis yet the daughter of Ypocras, in form and likeness of a great dragon,\r\nthat is a hundred fathom of length, as men say, for I have not seen her.\r\nAnd they of the isles call her Lady of the Land.  And she lieth in an old\r\ncastle, in a cave, and sheweth twice or thrice in the year, and she doth\r\nno harm to no man, but if men do her harm.  And she was thus changed and\r\ntransformed, from a fair damosel, into likeness of a dragon, by a goddess\r\nthat was clept Diana.  And men say, that she shall so endure in that form\r\nof a dragon, unto [the] time that a knight come, that is so hardy, that\r\ndare come to her and kiss her on the mouth; and then shall she turn again\r\nto her own kind, and be a woman again, but after that she shall not live\r\nlong.\r\n\r\nAnd it is not long sithen, that a knight of Rhodes, that was hardy and\r\ndoughty in arms, said that he would kiss her.  And when he was upon his\r\ncourser, and went to the castle, and entered into the cave, the dragon\r\nlift up her head against him.  And when the knight saw her in that form\r\nso hideous and so horrible he fled away.  And the dragon bare the knight\r\nupon a rock, maugre his head; and from that rock, she cast him into the\r\nsea.  And so was lost both horse and man.\r\n\r\nAnd also a young man, that wist not of the dragon, went out of a ship,\r\nand went through the isle till that he came to the castle, and came into\r\nthe cave, and went so long, till that he found a chamber; and there he\r\nsaw a damosel that combed her head and looked in a mirror; and she had\r\nmuch treasure about her.  And he trowed that she had been a common woman,\r\nthat dwelled there to receive men to folly.  And he abode, till the\r\ndamosel saw the shadow of him in the mirror.  And she turned her toward\r\nhim, and asked him what he would?  And he said, he would be her leman or\r\nparamour.  And she asked him, if that he were a knight?  And he said,\r\nnay.  And then she said, that he might not be her leman; but she bade him\r\ngo again unto his fellows, and make him knight, and come again upon the\r\nmorrow, and she should come out of the cave before him, and then come and\r\nkiss her on the mouth and have no dread,—for I shall do thee no manner of\r\nharm, albeit that thou see me in likeness of a dragon; for though thou\r\nsee me hideous and horrible to look on, I do thee to wit that it is made\r\nby enchantment; for without doubt, I am none other than thou seest now, a\r\nwoman, and therefore dread thee nought.  And if thou kiss me, thou shalt\r\nhave all this treasure, and be my lord, and lord also of all the isle.\r\n\r\nAnd he departed from her and went to his fellows to ship, and let make\r\nhim knight and came again upon the morrow for to kiss this damosel.  And\r\nwhen he saw her come out of the cave in form of a dragon, so hideous and\r\nso horrible, he had so great dread, that he fled again to the ship, and\r\nshe followed him.  And when she saw that he turned not again, she began\r\nto cry, as a thing that had much sorrow; and then she turned again into\r\nher cave.  And anon the knight died.  And sithen hitherward might no\r\nknight see her, but that he died anon.  But when a knight cometh, that is\r\nso hardy to kiss her, he shall not die; but he shall turn the damosel\r\ninto her right form and kindly shape, and he shall be lord of all the\r\ncountries and isles abovesaid.\r\n\r\nAnd from thence men come to the isle of Rhodes, the which isle\r\nHospitallers holden and govern; and that took they some-time from the\r\nemperor.  And it was wont to be clept Collos; and so call it the Turks\r\nyet.  And Saint Paul in his epistle writeth to them of that isle _ad\r\nColossenses_.  This isle is nigh eight hundred mile long from\r\nConstantinople.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\n\r\n[_Of diversities in Cyprus_; _of the Road from Cyprus to Jerusalem_, _and\r\nof the Marvel of a Fosse full of Sand_]\r\n\r\nAND from this isle of Rhodes men go to Cyprus, where be many vines, that\r\nfirst be red and after one year they become white; and those wines that\r\nbe most white, be most clear and best of smell.\r\n\r\nAnd men pass by that way, by a place that was wont to be a great city,\r\nand a great land; and the city was clept Cathailye, the which city and\r\nland was lost through folly of a young man.  For he had a fair damosel,\r\nthat he loved well to his paramour; and she died suddenly, and was done\r\nin a tomb of marble.  And for the great lust that he had to her, he went\r\nin the night unto her tomb and opened it, and went in and lay by her, and\r\nwent his way.  And when it came to the end of nine months, there came a\r\nvoice to him and said, Go to the tomb of that woman, and open it and\r\nbehold what thou hast begotten on her; and if thou let to go, thou shalt\r\nhave a great harm.  And he yede and opened the tomb, and there flew out\r\nan adder right hideous to see; the which as swithe flew about the city\r\nand the country, and soon after the city sank down.  And there be many\r\nperilous passages without fail.\r\n\r\nFrom Rhodes to Cyprus be five hundred mile and more.  But men may go to\r\nCyprus, and come not at Rhodes.  Cyprus is right a good isle, and a fair\r\nand a great, and it hath four principal cities within him.  And there is\r\nan Archbishop at Nicosea, and four other bishops in that land.  And at\r\nFamagost is one of the principal havens of the sea that is in the world;\r\nand there arrive Christian men and Saracens and men of all nations.  In\r\nCyprus is the Hill of the Holy Cross; and there is an abbey of monks\r\nblack and there is the cross of Dismas the good thief, as I have said\r\nbefore.  And some men trow, that there is half the cross of our Lord; but\r\nit is not so, and they do evil that make men to believe so.\r\n\r\nIn Cyprus lieth Saint Zenonimus, of whom men of that country make great\r\nsolemnity.  And in the castle of Amours lieth the body of Saint-Hilarion,\r\nand men keep it right worshipfully.  And beside Famagost was Saint\r\nBarnabas the apostle born.\r\n\r\nIn Cyprus men hunt with papyonns, that be like leopards, and they take\r\nwild beasts right well, and they be somewhat more than lions; and they\r\ntake more sharply the beasts, and more deliver than do hounds.\r\n\r\nIn Cyprus is the manner of lords and all other men all to eat on the\r\nearth.  For they make ditches in the earth all about in the hall, deep to\r\nthe knee, and they do pave them; and when they will eat, they go therein\r\nand sit there.  And the skill is for they may be the more fresh; for that\r\nland is much more hotter than it is here.  And at great feasts, and for\r\nstrangers, they set forms and tables, as men do in this country, but they\r\nhad lever sit in the earth.\r\n\r\nFrom Cyprus, men go to the land of Jerusalem by the sea: and in a day and\r\nin a night, he that hath good wind may come to the haven of Tyre, that is\r\nnow clept Surrye.  There was some-time a great city and a good of\r\nChristian men, but Saracens have destroyed it a great part; and they keep\r\nthat haven right well, for dread of Christian men.  Men might go more\r\nright to that haven, and come not in Cyprus, but they go gladly to Cyprus\r\nto rest them on the land, or else to buy things, that they have need to\r\ntheir living.  On the sea-side men may find many rubies.  And there is\r\nthe well of the which holy writ speaketh of, and saith, _Fons ortorum_,\r\n_et puteus aquarum viventium_: that is to say, ‘the well of gardens, and\r\nthe ditch of living waters.’\r\n\r\nIn this city of Tyre, said the woman to our Lord, _Beatus venter qui te\r\nportavit_, _et ubera que succisti_: that is to say, ‘Blessed be the body\r\nthat thee bare, and the paps that thou suckedst.’  And there our Lord\r\nforgave the woman of Canaan her sins.  And before Tyre was wont to be the\r\nstone, on the which our Lord sat and preached, and on that stone was\r\nfounded the Church of Saint Saviour.\r\n\r\nAnd eight mile from Tyre, toward the east, upon the sea, is the city of\r\nSarphen, in Sarepta of Sidonians.  And there was wont for to dwell Elijah\r\nthe prophet; and there raised he Jonas, the widow’s son, from death to\r\nlife.  And five mile from Sarphen is the city of Sidon; of the which\r\ncity, Dido was lady, that was Aeneas’ wife, after the destruction of\r\nTroy, and that founded the city of Carthage in Africa, and now is clept\r\nSidonsayete.  And in the city of Tyre, reigned Agenor, the father of\r\nDido.  And sixteen mile from Sidon is Beirout.  And from Beirout to\r\nSardenare is three journeys and from Sardenare is five mile to Damascus.\r\n\r\nAnd whoso will go long time on the sea, and come nearer to Jerusalem, he\r\nshall go from Cyprus by sea to Port Jaffa.  For that is the next haven to\r\nJerusalem; for from that haven is not but one day journey and a half to\r\nJerusalem.  And the town is called Jaffa; for one of the sons of Noah\r\nthat hight Japhet founded it, and now it is clept Joppa.  And ye shall\r\nunderstand, that it is one of the oldest towns of the world, for it was\r\nfounded before Noah’s flood.  And yet there sheweth in the rock, there as\r\nthe iron chains were fastened, that Andromeda, a great giant, was bounden\r\nwith, and put in prison before Noah’s flood, of the which giant, is a rib\r\nof his side that is forty foot long.\r\n\r\nAnd whoso will arrive at the port of Tyre or of Surrye, that I have\r\nspoken of before, may go by land, if he will, to Jerusalem.  And men go\r\nfrom Surrye unto the city of Akon in a day.  And it was clept some-time\r\nPtolemaïs.  And it was some-time a city of Christian men, full fair, but\r\nit is now destroyed; and it stands upon the sea.  And from Venice to\r\nAkon, by sea, is two thousand and four score miles of Lombardy; and from\r\nCalabria, or from Sicily to Akon, by sea, is a 1300 miles of Lombardy;\r\nand the isle of Crete is right in the midway.\r\n\r\nAnd beside the city of Akon, toward the sea, six score furlongs on the\r\nright side, toward the south, is the Hill of Carmel, where Elijah the\r\nprophet dwelled, and there was first the Order of Friars Carmelites\r\nfounded.  This hill is not right great, nor full high.  And at the foot\r\nof this hill was some-time a good city of Christian men, that men clept\r\nCaiffa, for Caiaphas first founded it; but it is now all wasted.  And on\r\nthe left side of the Hill of Carmel is a town, that men clepe Saffre, and\r\nthat is set on another hill.  There Saint James and Saint John were born;\r\nand, in worship of them there is a fair church.  And from Ptolemaïs, that\r\nmen clepe now Akon, unto a great hill, that is clept Scale of Tyre, is\r\none hundred furlongs.  And beside the city of Akon runneth a little\r\nriver, that is clept Belon.\r\n\r\nAnd there nigh is the Foss of Mennon that is all round; and it is one\r\nhundred cubits of largeness, and it is all full of gravel, shining\r\nbright, of the which men make fair verres and clear.  And men come from\r\nfar, by water in ships, and by land with carts, for to fetch of that\r\ngravel.  And though there be never so much taken away thereof in the day,\r\nat morrow it is as full again as ever it was; and that is a great marvel.\r\nAnd there is evermore great wind in that foss, that stirreth evermore the\r\ngravel, and maketh it trouble.  And if any man do therein any manner\r\nmetal, it turneth anon to glass.  And the glass, that is made of that\r\ngravel, if it be done again into the gravel, it turneth anon into gravel\r\nas it was first.  And therefore some men say, that it is a swallow of the\r\ngravelly sea.\r\n\r\nAlso from Akon, above-said, go men forth four journeys to the city of\r\nPalestine, that was of the Philistines, that now is clept Gaza, that is a\r\ngay city and a rich; and it is right fair and full of folk, and it is a\r\nlittle from the sea.  And from this city brought Samson the strong the\r\ngates upon an high land, when he was taken in that city, and there he\r\nslew in a palace the king and himself, and great number of the best of\r\nthe Philistines, the which had put out his eyen and shaved his head, and\r\nimprisoned him by treason of Dalida his paramour.  And therefore he made\r\nfall upon them a great hall, when they were at meat.\r\n\r\nAnd from thence go men to the city of Cesarea, and so to the Castle of\r\nPilgrims, and so to Ascalon; and then to Jaffa, and so to Jerusalem.\r\n\r\nAnd whoso will go by land through the land of Babylon, where the soldan\r\ndwelleth commonly, he must get grace of him and leave to go more siker\r\nthrough those lands and countries.\r\n\r\nAnd for to go to the Mount of Sinai, before that men go to Jerusalem,\r\nthey shall go from Gaza to the Castle of Daire.  And after that, men come\r\nout of Syria, and enter into wilderness, and there the way is full sandy;\r\nand that wilderness and desert lasteth eight journeys, but always men\r\nfind good inns, and all that they need of victuals.  And men clepe that\r\nwilderness Achelleke.  And when a man cometh out of that desert, he\r\nentereth into Egypt, that men clepe Egypt-Canopac, and after other\r\nlanguage, men clepe it Morsyn.  And there first men find a good town,\r\nthat is clept Belethe; and it is at the end of the kingdom of Aleppo.\r\nAnd from thence men go to Babylon and to Cairo.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\n\r\n        _Of many Names of Soldans_, _and of the Tower of Babylon_\r\n\r\nAT Babylon there is a fair church of our Lady, where she dwelled seven\r\nyear, when she fled out of the land of Judea for dread of King Herod.\r\nAnd there lieth the body of Saint Barbara the virgin and martyr.  And\r\nthere dwelled Joseph, when he was sold of his brethren.  And there made\r\nNebuchadnezzar the king put three children into the furnace of fire, for\r\nthey were in the right truth of belief, the which children men clept\r\nAnania, Azariah, Mishael, as the Psalm of _Benedicite_ saith: but\r\nNebuchadnezzar clept them otherwise, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego,\r\nthat is to say, God glorious, God victorious, and God over all things and\r\nrealms: and that was for the miracle, that he saw God’s Son go with the\r\nchildren through the fire, as he said.\r\n\r\nThere dwelleth the soldan in his Calahelyke (for there is commonly his\r\nseat) in a fair castle, strong and great, and well set upon a rock.  In\r\nthat castle dwell alway, to keep it and to serve the soldan, more then\r\n6000 persons, that take all their necessaries off the soldan’s court.  I\r\nought right well to know it; for I dwelled with him as soldier in his\r\nwars a great while against the Bedouins.  And he would have married me\r\nfull highly to a great prince’s daughter, if I would have forsaken my law\r\nand my belief; but I thank God, I had no will to do it, for nothing that\r\nhe behight me.\r\n\r\nAnd ye shall understand that the soldan is lord of five kingdoms, that he\r\nhath conquered and appropred to him by strength.  And these be the names:\r\nthe kingdom of Canapac, that is Egypt; and the kingdom of Jerusalem,\r\nwhere that David and Solomon were kings; and the kingdom of Syria, of the\r\nwhich the city of Damascus was chief; and the kingdom of Aleppo in the\r\nland of Mathe; and the kingdom Arabia, that was to one of the three\r\nkings, that made offering to our Lord, when he was born.  And many other\r\nlands he holdeth in his hand.  And therewithal he holdeth caliphs, that\r\nis a full great thing in their language, and it is as much to say as\r\nking.\r\n\r\nAnd there were wont to be five soldans; but now there is no more but he\r\nof Egypt.  And the first soldan was Zarocon, that was of Media, as was\r\nfather to Saladin that took the Caliph of Egypt and slew him, and was\r\nmade soldan by strength.  After that was Soldan Saladin, in whose time\r\nthe King of England, Richard the First, with many other, kept the\r\npassage, that Saladin ne might not pass.  After Saladin reigned his son\r\nBoradin, and after him his nephew.  After that, the Comanians that were\r\nin servage in Egypt, felt themselves that they were of great power, they\r\nchose them a soldan amongst them, the which made him to be clept\r\nMelechsalan.  And in his time entered into the country of the kings of\r\nFrance Saint Louis, and fought with him; and [the soldan] took him and\r\nimprisoned him; and this [soldan] was slain by his own servants.  And\r\nafter, they chose another to be soldan, that they clept Tympieman; and he\r\nlet deliver Saint Louis out of prison for a certain ransom.  And after,\r\none of these Comanians reigned, that hight Cachas, and slew Tympieman,\r\nfor to be soldan; and made him be clept Melechmenes.  And after another\r\nthat had to name Bendochdare, that slew Melechmenes, for to be sultan,\r\nand clept himself Melechdare.  In his time entered the good King Edward\r\nof England into Syria, and did great harm to the Saracens.  And after,\r\nwas this soldan empoisoned at Damascus, and his son thought to reign\r\nafter him by heritage, and made him to be clept Melechsache; but another\r\nthat had to name Elphy, chased him out of the country and made him\r\nsoldan.  This man took the city of Tripoli and destroyed many of the\r\nChristian men, the year of grace 1289, and after was he imprisoned of\r\nanother that would be soldan, but he was anon slain.  After that was the\r\nson of Elphy chosen to be soldan, and clept him Melechasseraff, and he\r\ntook the city of Akon and chased out the Christian men; and this was also\r\nempoisoned, and then was his brother made soldan, and was clept\r\nMelechnasser.  And after, one that was clept Guytoga took him and put him\r\nin prison in the castle of Mountroyal, and made him soldan by strength,\r\nand clept him Melechadel; and he was of Tartary.  But the Comanians\r\nchased him out of the country, and did him much sorrow, and made one of\r\nthemself soldan, that had to name Lachin.  And he made him to be clept\r\nMelechmanser, the which on a day played at the chess, and his sword lay\r\nbeside him; and so befell, that one wrathed him, and with his own proper\r\nsword he was slain.  And after that, they were at great discord, for to\r\nmake a soldan; and finally they accorded to Melechnasser, that Guytoga\r\nhad put in prison at Mountroyal.  And this reigned long and governed so\r\nthat his eldest son was chosen after him, Melechmader, the which his\r\nbrother let slay privily for to have the lordship, and made him to be\r\nclept Melechmadabron, and he soldan when I departed from those countries.\r\n\r\nAnd wit ye well that the soldan may lead out of Egypt more than 20,000\r\nmen of arms, and out of Syria, and out of Turkey and out of other\r\ncountries that he holds, he may arrere more than 50,000.  And all those\r\nbe at his wages, and they be always at him, without the folk of his\r\ncountry, that is without number.  And every each of them hath by year the\r\nmountance of six score florins; but it behoveth, that every of them hold\r\nthree horses and a camel.  And by the cities and by towns be admirals,\r\nthat have the governance of the people; one hath to govern four, and\r\nanother hath to govern five, another more, and another well more.  And as\r\nmany taketh the admiral by him alone, as all the other soldiers have\r\nunder him; and therefore, when the soldan will advance any worthy knight,\r\nhe maketh him an admiral.  And when it is any dearth, the knights be\r\nright poor, and then they sell both their horse and their harness.\r\n\r\nAnd the soldan hath four wives, one Christian and three Saracens, of the\r\nwhich one dwelleth at Jerusalem, and another at Damascus, and another at\r\nAscalon; and when them list, they remove to other cities, and when the\r\nsoldan will he may go to visit them.  And he hath as many paramours as\r\nhim liketh.  For he maketh to come before him the fairest and the noblest\r\nof birth, and the gentlest damosels of his country, and he maketh them to\r\nbe kept and served full honourably.  And when he will have one to lie\r\nwith him, he maketh them all to come before him, and he beholdeth in all,\r\nwhich of them is most to his pleasure, and to her anon he sendeth or\r\ncasteth a ring from his finger.  And then anon she shall be bathed and\r\nrichly attired, and anointed with delicate things of sweet smell, and\r\nthen led to the soldan’s chamber; and thus he doth as often as him list,\r\nwhen he will have any of them.\r\n\r\nAnd before the soldan cometh no stranger, but if he be clothed in cloth\r\nof gold, or of Tartary or of Camaka, in the Saracens’ guise, and as the\r\nSaracens use.  And it behoveth, that anon at the first sight that men see\r\nthe soldan, be it in window or in what place else, that men kneel to him\r\nand kiss the earth, for that is the manner to do reverence to the soldan\r\nof them that speak with him.  And when that messengers of strange\r\ncountries come before him, the meinie of the soldan, when the strangers\r\nspeak to him, they be about the soldan with swords drawn and gisarmes and\r\naxes, their arms lifted up in high with those weapons for to smite upon\r\nthem, if they say any word that is displeasance to the soldan.  And also,\r\nno stranger cometh before him, but that he maketh him some promise and\r\ngrant of that the [stranger] asketh reasonably; by so it be not against\r\nhis law.  And so do other princes beyond, for they say that no man shall\r\ncome before no prince, but that [he be] better, and shall be more gladder\r\nin departing from his presence than he was at the coming before him.\r\n\r\nAnd understandeth, that that Babylon that I have spoken of, where that\r\nthe sultan dwelleth, is not that great Babylon where the diversity of\r\nlanguages was first made for vengeance by the miracle of God, when the\r\ngreat Tower of Babel was begun to be made; of the which the walls were\r\nsixty-four furlongs of height; that is in the great desert of Arabia,\r\nupon the way as men go toward the kingdom of Chaldea.  But it is full\r\nlong since that any man durst nigh to the tower; for it is all desert and\r\nfull of dragons and great serpents, and full of diverse venomous beasts\r\nall about.  That tower, with the city, was of twenty-five mile in circuit\r\nof the walls, as they of the country say, and as men may deem by\r\nestimation, after that men tell of the country.\r\n\r\nAnd though it be clept the Tower of Babylon, yet nevertheless, there were\r\nordained within many mansions and many great dwelling-places, in length\r\nand breadth.  And that tower contained great country in circuit, for the\r\ntower alone contained ten mile square.  That tower founded King Nimrod\r\nthat was king of that country; and he was the first king of the world.\r\nAnd he let make an image in the likeness of his father, and constrained\r\nall his subjects for to worship it; and anon began other lords to do the\r\nsame, and so began the idols and the simulacres first.\r\n\r\nThe town and the city were full well set in a fair country and a plain\r\nthat men clepe the country of Samar, of the which the walls of the city\r\nwere two hundred cubits in height, and fifty cubits of deepness; and the\r\nriver of Euphrates ran throughout the city and about the tower also.  But\r\nCyrus the King of Persia took from them the river, and destroyed all the\r\ncity and the tower also; for he departed that river in 360 small rivers,\r\nbecause that he had sworn, that he should put the river in such point,\r\nthat a woman might well pass there, without casting off of her clothes,\r\nforasmuch as he had lost many worthy men that trowed to pass that river\r\nby swimming.\r\n\r\nAnd from Babylon where the soldan dwelleth, to go right between the\r\nOrient and the Septentrion toward the great Babylon, is forty journeys to\r\npass by desert.  But it is not the great Babylon in the land and in the\r\npower of the said soldan, but it is in the power and the lordship of\r\nPersia, but he holdeth it of the great Chan, that is the greatest emperor\r\nand the most sovereign lord of all the parts beyond, and he is lord of\r\nthe isles of Cathay and of many other isles and of a great part of Ind,\r\nand his land marcheth unto Prester John’s Land, and he holdeth so much\r\nland, that he knoweth not the end: and he is more mighty and greater lord\r\nwithout comparison than is the soldan: of his royal estate and of his\r\nmight I shall speak more plenerly, when I shall speak of the land and of\r\nthe country of Ind.\r\n\r\nAlso the city of Mecca where Mohammet lieth is of the great deserts of\r\nArabia; and there lieth [the] body of him full honourably in their\r\ntemple, that the Saracens clepen Musketh.  And it is from Babylon the\r\nless, where the soldan dwelleth, unto Mecca above-said, into a thirty-two\r\njourneys.\r\n\r\nAnd wit well, that the realm of Arabia is a full great country, but\r\ntherein is over-much desert.  And no man may dwell there in that desert\r\nfor default of water, for that land is all gravelly and full of sand.\r\nAnd it is dry and no thing fruitful, because that it hath no moisture;\r\nand therefore is there so much desert.  And if it had rivers and wells,\r\nand the land also were as it is in other parts, it should be as full of\r\npeople and as full inhabited with folk as in other places; for there is\r\nfull great multitude of people, whereas the land is inhabited.  Arabia\r\ndureth from the ends of the realm of Chaldea unto the last end of Africa,\r\nand marcheth to the land of Idumea toward the end of Botron.  And in\r\nChaldea the chief city is Bagdad.  And of Africa the chief city is\r\nCarthage, that Dido, that was Eneas’s wife, founded; the which Eneas was\r\nof the city of Troy, and after was King of Italy.\r\n\r\nMesopotamia stretcheth also unto the deserts of Arabia, and it is a great\r\ncountry.  In this country is the city of Haran, where Abraham’s father\r\ndwelled, and from whence Abraham departed by commandment of the angel.\r\nAnd of that city was Ephraim, that was a great clerk and a great doctor.\r\nAnd Theophilus was of that city also, that our lady saved from our enemy.\r\nAnd Mesopotamia dureth from the river of Euphrates, unto the river of\r\nTigris, for it is between those two rivers.\r\n\r\nAnd beyond the river of Tigris is Chaldea, that is a full great kingdom.\r\nIn that realm, at Bagdad above-said, was wont to dwell the caliph, that\r\nwas wont to be both as Emperor and Pope of the Arabians, so that he was\r\nlord spiritual and temporal; and he was successor to Mahommet, and of his\r\ngeneration.  That city of Bagdad was wont to be clept Sutis, and\r\nNebuchadnezzar founded it; and there dwelled the holy prophet Daniel, and\r\nthere he saw visions of heaven, and there he made the exposition of\r\ndreams.\r\n\r\nAnd in old time there were wont to be three caliphs, he of Arabia and of\r\nChaldea dwelt in the city of Bagdad above-said; and at Cairo beside\r\nBabylon dwelt the Caliph of Egypt; and at Morocco, upon the West Sea,\r\ndwelt the Caliph of the people of Barbary and of Africans.  And now is\r\nthere none of the caliphs, nor nought have been since the time of the\r\nSoldan Saladin; for from that time hither the soldan clepeth himself\r\ncaliph, and so have the caliphs lost their name.\r\n\r\nAlso witeth well, that Babylon the less, where the soldan dwelleth, and\r\nat the city of Cairo that is nigh beside it, be great huge cities many\r\nand fair; and that one sitteth nigh that other.  Babylon sitteth upon the\r\nriver of Gyson, sometimes clept Nile, that cometh out of Paradise\r\nterrestrial.\r\n\r\nThat river of Nile, all the year, when the sun entereth into the sign of\r\nCancer, it beginneth to wax, and it waxeth always as long as the sun is\r\nin Cancer and in the sign of the Lion; and it waxeth in such manner, that\r\nit is sometimes so great, that it is twenty cubits or more of deepness,\r\nand then it doth great harm to the goods that be upon the land.  For then\r\nmay no man travail to plough the lands for the great moisture, and\r\ntherefore is there dear time in that country.  And also, when it waxeth\r\nlittle, it is dear time in that country, for default of moisture.  And\r\nwhen the sun is in the sign of Virgo, then beginneth the river for to\r\nwane and to decrease little and little, so that when the sun is entered\r\ninto the sign of Libra, then they enter between these rivers.  This river\r\ncometh, running from Paradise terrestrial, between the deserts of Ind,\r\nand after it smiteth unto land, and runneth long time many great\r\ncountries under earth.  And after it goeth out under an high hill, that\r\nmen clepe Alothe, that is between Ind and Ethiopia the mountance of five\r\nmonths’ journeys from the entry of Ethiopia; and after it environeth all\r\nEthiopia and Mauritania, and goeth all along from the land of Egypt unto\r\nthe city of Alexandria to the end of Egypt, and there it falleth into the\r\nsea.  About this river be many birds and fowls, as sikonies, that they\r\nclepen ibes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\n\r\n_Of the Country of Egypt_; _of the Bird Phoenix of Arabia_; _of the City\r\nof Cairo_; _of the Cunning to know Balm and to prove it_; _and of the\r\nGarners of Joseph_\r\n\r\nEGYPT is a long country, but it is straight, that is to say narrow, for\r\nthey may not enlarge it toward the desert for default of water.  And the\r\ncountry is set along upon the river of Nile, by as much as that river may\r\nserve by floods or otherwise, that when it floweth it may spread abroad\r\nthrough the country; so is the country large of length.  For there it\r\nraineth not but little in that country, and for that cause they have no\r\nwater, but if it be of that flood of that river.  And forasmuch as it ne\r\nraineth not in that country, but the air is alway pure and clear,\r\ntherefore in that country be the good astronomers, for they find there no\r\nclouds to letten them.  Also the city of Cairo is right great and more\r\nhuge than that of Babylon the less, and it sitteth above toward the\r\ndesert of Syria, a little above the river above-said.\r\n\r\nIn Egypt there be two parts: the height, that is toward Ethiopia, and the\r\nlower, that is toward Arabia.  In Egypt is the land of Rameses and the\r\nland of Goshen.  Egypt is a strong country, for it hath many shrewd\r\nhavens because of the great rocks that be strong and dangerous to pass\r\nby.  And at Egypt, toward the east, is the Red Sea, that dureth unto the\r\ncity of Coston; and toward the west is the country of Lybia, that is a\r\nfull dry land and little of fruit, for it is overmuch plenty of heat, and\r\nthat land is clept Fusthe.  And toward the part meridional is Ethiopia.\r\nAnd toward the north is the desert, that dureth unto Syria, and so is the\r\ncountry strong on all sides.  And it is well a fifteen journeys of\r\nlength, and more than two so much of desert, and it is but two journeys\r\nin largeness.  And between Egypt and Nubia it hath well a twelve journeys\r\nof desert.  And men of Nubia be Christian, but they be black as the Moors\r\nfor great heat of the sun.\r\n\r\nIn Egypt there be five provinces: that one is Sahythe; that other\r\nDemeseer; another Resith, that is an isle in the Nile; another\r\nAlexandria; and another the land of Damietta.  That city was wont to be\r\nright strong, but it was twice won of the Christian men, and therefore\r\nafter that the Saracens beat down the walls; and with the walls the tower\r\nthereof, the Saracens made another city more far from the sea, and clept\r\nit the new Damietta; so that now no man dwelleth at the rather town of\r\nDamietta.  At that city of Damietta is one of the havens of Egypt; and at\r\nAlexandria is that other.  That is a full strong city, but there is no\r\nwater to drink, but if it come by conduit from Nile, that entereth into\r\ntheir cisterns; and whoso stopped that water from them, they might not\r\nendure there.  In Egypt there be but few forcelets or castles, because\r\nthat the country is so strong of himself.\r\n\r\nAt the deserts of Egypt was a worthy man, that was an holy hermit, and\r\nthere met with him a monster (that is to say, a monster is a thing\r\ndeformed against kind both of man or of beast or of anything else, and\r\nthat is clept a monster).  And this monster, that met with this holy\r\nhermit, was as it had been a man, that had two horns trenchant on his\r\nforehead; and he had a body like a man unto the navel, and beneath he had\r\nthe body like a goat.  And the hermit asked him what he was.  And the\r\nmonster answered him, and said he was a deadly creature, such as God had\r\nformed, and dwelt in those deserts in purchasing his sustenance.  And\r\n[he] besought the hermit, that he would pray God for him, the which that\r\ncame from heaven for to save all mankind, and was born of a maiden and\r\nsuffered passion and death (as we well know) and by whom we live and be.\r\nAnd yet is the head with the two horns of that monster at Alexandria for\r\na marvel.\r\n\r\nIn Egypt is the city of Heliopolis, that is to say, the city of the Sun.\r\nIn that city there is a temple, made round after the shape of the Temple\r\nof Jerusalem.  The priests of that temple have all their writings, under\r\nthe date of the fowl that is clept phoenix; and there is none but one in\r\nall the world.  And he cometh to burn himself upon the altar of that\r\ntemple at the end of five hundred year; for so long he liveth.  And at\r\nthe five hundred years’ end, the priests array their altar honestly, and\r\nput thereupon spices and sulphur vif and other things that will burn\r\nlightly; and then the bird phoenix cometh and burneth himself to ashes.\r\nAnd the first day next after, men find in the ashes a worm; and the\r\nsecond day next after, men find a bird quick and perfect; and the third\r\nday next after, he flieth his way.  And so there is no more birds of that\r\nkind in all the world, but it alone, and truly that is a great miracle of\r\nGod.  And men may well liken that bird unto God, because that there ne is\r\nno God but one; and also, that our Lord arose from death to life the\r\nthird day.  This bird men see often-time fly in those countries; and he\r\nis not mickle more than an eagle.  And he hath a crest of feathers upon\r\nhis head more great than the peacock hath; and is neck his yellow after\r\ncolour of an oriel that is a stone well shining, and his beak is coloured\r\nblue as ind; and his wings be of purple colour, and his tail is barred\r\noverthwart with green and yellow and red.  And he is a full fair bird to\r\nlook upon, against the sun, for he shineth full gloriously and nobly.\r\n\r\nAlso in Egypt be gardens, that have trees and herbs, the which bear\r\nfruits seven times in the year.  And in that land men find many fair\r\nemeralds and enough; and therefore they be greater cheap.  Also when it\r\nraineth once in the summer in the land of Egypt, then is all the country\r\nfull of great mires.  Also at Cairo, that I spake of before, sell men\r\ncommonly both men and women of other laws as we do here beasts in the\r\nmarket.  And there is a common house in that city that is all full of\r\nsmall furnaces, and thither bring women of the town their eyren of hens,\r\nof geese, and or ducks for to be put into those furnaces.  And they that\r\nkeep that house cover them with heat of horse dung, without hen, goose or\r\nduck or any other fowl.  And at the end of three weeks or of a month they\r\ncome again and take their chickens and flourish them and bring them\r\nforth, so that all the country is full of them.  And so men do there both\r\nwinter and summer.\r\n\r\nAlso in that country and in others also, men find long apples to sell, in\r\ntheir season, and men clepe them apples of Paradise; and they be right\r\nsweet and of good savour.  And though ye cut them in never so many\r\ngobbets or parts, overthwart or endlong, evermore ye shall find in the\r\nmidst the figure of the Holy Cross of our Lord Jesu.  But they will rot\r\nwithin eight days, and for that cause men may not carry of those apples\r\nto no far countries; of them men find the mountance of a hundred in a\r\nbasket, and they have great leaves of a foot and a half of length, and\r\nthey be convenably large.  And men find there also the apple tree of\r\nAdam, that have a bite at one of the sides; and there be also fig trees\r\nthat bear no leaves, but figs upon the small branches; and men clepe them\r\nfigs of Pharaoh.\r\n\r\nAlso beside Cairo, without that city, is the field where balm groweth;\r\nand it cometh out on small trees, that be none higher than to a man’s\r\nbreeks’ girdle, and they seem as wood that is of the wild vine.  And in\r\nthat field be seven wells, that our Lord Jesu Christ made with one of his\r\nfeet, when he went to play with other children.  That field is not so\r\nwell closed, but that men may enter at their own list; but in that season\r\nthat the balm is growing, men put thereto good keeping, that no man dare\r\nbe hardy to enter.\r\n\r\nThis balm groweth in no place, but only there.  And though that men bring\r\nof the plants, for to plant in other countries, they grow well and fair;\r\nbut they bring forth no fructuous thing, and the leaves of balm fall not.\r\nAnd men cut the branches with a sharp flintstone, or with a sharp bone,\r\nwhen men will go to cut them; for whoso cut them with iron, it would\r\ndestroy his virtue and his nature.\r\n\r\nAnd the Saracens clepe the wood _Enonch-balse_, and the fruit, the which\r\nis as cubebs, they clepe _Abebissam_, and the liquor that droppeth from\r\nthe branches they clepe _Guybalse_.  And men make always that balm to be\r\ntilled of the Christian men, or else it would not fructify; as the\r\nSaracens say themselves, for it hath been often-time proved.  Men say\r\nalso, that the balm groweth in Ind the more, in that desert where\r\nAlexander spake to the trees of the sun and of the moon, but I have not\r\nseen it; for I have not been so far above upward, because that there be\r\ntoo many perilous passages.\r\n\r\nAnd wit ye well, that a man ought to take good keep for to buy balm, but\r\nif he con know it right well, for he may right lightly be deceived.  For\r\nmen sell a gum, that men clepe turpentine, instead of balm, and they put\r\nthereto a little balm for to give good odour.  And some put wax in oil of\r\nthe wood of the fruit of balm, and say that it is balm.  And some distil\r\ncloves of gilofre and of spikenard of Spain and of other spices, that be\r\nwell smelling; and the liquor that goeth out thereof they clepe it balm,\r\nand they think that they have balm, and they have none.  For the Saracens\r\ncounterfeit it by subtlety of craft for to deceive the Christian men, as\r\nI have seen full many a time; and after them the merchants and the\r\napothecaries counterfeit it eft sones, and then it is less worth, and a\r\ngreat deal worse.\r\n\r\nBut if it like you, I shall shew how ye shall know and prove, to the end\r\nthat ye shall not be deceived.  First ye shall well know, that the\r\nnatural balm is full clear, and of citron colour and strongly smelling;\r\nand if it be thick, or red or black, it is sophisticate, that is to say,\r\ncounterfeited and made like it for deceit.  And understand, that if ye\r\nwill put a little balm in the palm of your hand against the sun, if it be\r\nfine and good, ye ne shall not suffer your hand against the heat of the\r\nsun.  Also take a little balm with the point of a knife, and touch it to\r\nthe fire, and if it burn it is a good sign.  After take also a drop of\r\nbalm, and put it into a dish, or in a cup with milk of a goat, and if it\r\nbe natural balm anon it will take and beclippe the milk.  Or put a drop\r\nof balm in clear water in a cup of silver or in a clear basin, stir it\r\nwell with the clear water; and if the balm be fine and of his own kind,\r\nthe water shall never trouble; and if the balm be sophisticate, that is\r\nto say counterfeited, the water shall become anon trouble; and also if\r\nthe balm be fine it shall fall to the bottom of the vessel, as though it\r\nwere quicksilver, for the fine balm is more heavy twice than is the balm\r\nthat is sophisticate and counterfeited.  Now I have spoken of balm.\r\n\r\nAnd now also I shall speak of another thing that is beyond Babylon, above\r\nthe flood of the Nile, toward the desert between Africa and Egypt; that\r\nis to say, of the garners of Joseph, that he let make for to keep the\r\ngrains for the peril of the dear years.  And they be made of stone, full\r\nwell made of masons’ craft; of the which two be marvellously great and\r\nhigh, and the tother ne be not so great.  And every garner hath a gate\r\nfor to enter within, a little high from the earth; for the land is wasted\r\nand fallen since the garners were made.  And within they be all full of\r\nserpents.  And above the garners without be many scriptures of diverse\r\nlanguages.  And some men say, that they be sepultures of great lords,\r\nthat were sometime, but that is not true, for all the common rumour and\r\nspeech is of all the people there, both far and near, that they be the\r\ngarners of Joseph; and so find they in their scriptures, and in their\r\nchronicles.  On the other part, if they were sepultures, they should not\r\nbe void within, ne they should have no gates for to enter within; for ye\r\nmay well know, that tombs and sepultures be not made of such greatness,\r\nnor of such highness; wherefore it is not to believe, that they be tombs\r\nor sepultures.\r\n\r\nIn Egypt also there be diverse languages and diverse letters, and of\r\nother manner and condition than there be in other parts.  As I shall\r\ndevise you, such as they be, and the names how they clepe them, to such\r\nintent, that ye may know the difference of them and of others,—Athoimis,\r\nBimchi, Chinok, Duram, Eni, Fin, Gomor, Heket, Janny, Karacta, Luzanin,\r\nMiche, Naryn, Oldach, Pilon, Qyn, Yron, Sichen, Thola, Urmron, Yph and\r\nZarm, Thoit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\n\r\n_Of the Isle of Sicily_; _of the way from Babylon to the Mount Sinai_;\r\n_of the Church of Saint Katherine and of all the marvels there_\r\n\r\nNOW will I return again, ere I proceed any further, for to declare to you\r\nthe other ways, that draw toward Babylon, where the sultan himself\r\ndwelleth, that is at the entry of Egypt; for as much as many folk go\r\nthither first and after that to the Mount Sinai, and after return to\r\nJerusalem, as I have said you here before.  For they fulfil first the\r\nmore long pilgrimage, and after return again by the next ways, because\r\nthat the more nigh way is the more worthy, and that is Jerusalem; for no\r\nother pilgrimage is not like in comparison to it.  But for to fulfil\r\ntheir pilgrimages more easily and more sikerly, men go first the longer\r\nway rather than the nearer way.\r\n\r\nBut whoso will go to Babylon by another way, more short from the\r\ncountries of the west that I have rehearsed before, or from other\r\ncountries next to them—then men go by France, by Burgundy and by\r\nLombardy.  It needeth not to tell you the names of the cities, nor of the\r\ntowns that be in that way, for the way is common, and it is known of many\r\nnations.  And there be many havens [where] men take the sea.  Some men\r\ntake the sea at Genoa, some at Venice, and pass by the sea Adriatic, that\r\nis clept the Gulf of Venice, that departeth Italy and Greece on that\r\nside; and some go to Naples, some to Rome, and from Rome to Brindisi and\r\nthere they take the sea, and in many other places where that havens be.\r\nAnd men go by Tuscany, by Campania, by Calabria, by Apulia, and by the\r\nhills of Italy, by Corsica, by Sardinia, and by Sicily, that is a great\r\nisle and a good.\r\n\r\nIn that isle of Sicily there is a manner of a garden, in the which be\r\nmany diverse fruits; and the garden is always green and flourishing, all\r\nthe seasons of the year as well in winter as in summer.  That isle holds\r\nin compass about 350 French miles.  And between Sicily and Italy there is\r\nnot but a little arm of the sea, that men clepe the Farde of Messina.\r\nAnd Sicily is between the sea Adriatic and the sea of Lombardy.  And from\r\nSicily into Calabria is but eight miles of Lombardy.\r\n\r\nAnd in Sicily there is a manner of serpent, by the which men assay and\r\nprove, whether their children be bastards or no, or of lawful marriage:\r\nfor if they be born in right marriage, the serpents go about them, and do\r\nthem no harm, and if they be born in avoutry, the serpents bite them and\r\nenvenom them.  And thus many wedded men prove if the children be their\r\nown.\r\n\r\nAlso in that isle is the Mount Etna, that men clepe Mount Gybelle, and\r\nthe volcanoes that be evermore burning.  And there be seven places that\r\nburn and that cast out diverse flames and diverse colour: and by the\r\nchanging of those flames, men of that country know when it shall be\r\ndearth or good time, or cold or hot or moist or dry, or in all other\r\nmanners how the time shall be governed.  And from Italy unto the\r\nvolcanoes ne is but twenty-five mile.  And men say, that the volcanoes be\r\nways of hell.\r\n\r\nAnd whoso goeth by Pisa, if that men list to go that way, there is an arm\r\nof the sea, where that men go to other havens in those marches.  And then\r\nmen pass by the isle of Greaf that is at Genoa.  And after arrive men in\r\nGreece at the haven of the city of Myrok, or at the haven of Valone, or\r\nat the city of Duras; and there is a Duke at Duras, or at other havens in\r\nthose marches; and so men go to Constantinople.  And after go men by\r\nwater to the isle of Crete and to the isle of Rhodes, and so to Cyprus,\r\nand so to Athens, and from thence to Constantinople.  To hold the more\r\nright way by sea, it is well a thousand eight hundred and four score mile\r\nof Lombardy.  And after from Cyprus men go by sea, and leave Jerusalem\r\nand all the country on the left hand, unto Egypt, and arrive at the city\r\nof Damietta, that was wont to be full strong, and it sits at the entry of\r\nEgypt.  And from Damietta go men to the city of Alexandria, that sits\r\nalso upon the sea.  In that city was Saint Catherine beheaded: and there\r\nwas Saint Mark the evangelist martyred and buried, but the Emperor Leo\r\nmade his bones to be brought to Venice.\r\n\r\nAnd yet there is at Alexandria a fair church, all white without\r\npaintures; and so be all the other churches that were of the Christian\r\nmen, all white within, for the Paynims and the Saracens made them white\r\nfor to fordo the images of saints that were painted on the walls.  That\r\ncity of Alexandria is well thirty furlongs in length, but it is but ten\r\non largeness; and it is a full noble city and a fair.  At that city\r\nentereth the river of Nile into the sea, as I to you have said before.\r\nIn that river men find many precious stones, and much also of lignum\r\naloes; and it is a manner of wood, that cometh out of Paradise\r\nterrestrial, the which is good for many diverse medicines, and it is\r\nright dear-worth.  And from Alexandria men go to Babylon, where the\r\nsultan dwelleth; that sits also upon the river of Nile: and this way is\r\nthe most short, for to go straight unto Babylon.\r\n\r\nNow shall I say you also the way, that goeth from Babylon to the Mount of\r\nSinai, where Saint Catherine lieth.  He must pass by the deserts of\r\nArabia, by the which deserts Moses led the people of Israel.  And then\r\npass men by the well that Moses made with his hand in the deserts, when\r\nthe people grucched; for they found nothing to drink.  And then pass men\r\nby the Well of Marah, of the which the water was first bitter; but the\r\nchildren of Israel put therein a tree, and anon the water was sweet and\r\ngood for to drink.  And then go men by desert unto the vale of Elim, in\r\nthe which vale be twelve wells; and there be seventy-two trees of palm,\r\nthat bear the dates the which Moses found with the children of Israel.\r\nAnd from that valley is but a good journey to the Mount of Sinai.\r\n\r\nAnd whoso will go by another way from Babylon, then men go by the Red\r\nSea, that is an arm of the sea Ocean.  And there passed Moses with the\r\nchildren of Israel, over-thwart the sea all dry, when Pharaoh the King of\r\nEgypt chased them.  And that sea is well a six mile of largeness in\r\nlength; and in that sea was Pharaoh drowned and all his host that he led.\r\nThat sea is not more red than another sea; but in some place thereof is\r\nthe gravel red, and therefore men clepen it the Red Sea.  That sea\r\nrunneth to the ends of Arabia and of Palestine.\r\n\r\nThat sea lasteth more than a four journeys, and then go men by desert\r\nunto the Vale of Elim, and from thence to the Mount of Sinai.  And ye may\r\nwell understand, that by this desert no man may go on horseback, because\r\nthat there ne is neither meat for horse ne water to drink; and for that\r\ncause men pass that desert with camels.  For the camel finds alway meat\r\nin trees and on bushes, that he feedeth him with: and he may well fast\r\nfrom drink two days or three.  And that may no horse do.\r\n\r\nAnd wit well that from Babylon to the Mount Sinai is well a twelve good\r\njourneys, and some men make them more.  And some men hasten them and pain\r\nthem, and therefore they make them less.  And always men find latiners to\r\ngo with them in the countries, and further beyond, into time that men con\r\nthe language: and it behoveth men to bear victuals with them, that shall\r\ndure them in those deserts, and other necessaries for to live by.\r\n\r\nAnd the Mount of Sinai is clept the Desert of Sin, that is for to say,\r\nthe bush burning; because there Moses saw our Lord God many times in the\r\nform of fire burning upon that hill, and also in a bush burning, and\r\nspake to him.  And that was at the foot of the hill.  There is an abbey\r\nof monks, well builded and well closed with gates of iron for dread of\r\nthe wild beasts; and the monks be Arabians or men of Greece.  And there\r\n[is] a great convent, and all they be as hermits, and they drink no wine,\r\nbut if it be on principal feasts; and they be full devout men, and live\r\npoorly and simply with joutes and with dates, and they do great\r\nabstinence and penances.\r\n\r\nThere is the Church of Saint Catherine, in the which be many lamps\r\nburning; for they have of oil of olives enough, both for to burn in their\r\nlamps and to eat also.  And that plenty have they by the miracle of God;\r\nfor the ravens and the crows and the choughs and other fowls of the\r\ncountry assemble them there every year once, and fly thither as in\r\npilgrimage; and everych of them bringeth a branch of the bays or of olive\r\nin their beaks instead of offering, and leave them there; of the which\r\nthe monks make great plenty of oil.  And this is a great marvel.  And\r\nsith that fowls that have no kindly wit or reason go thither to seek that\r\nglorious Virgin, well more ought men then to seek her, and to worship\r\nher.\r\n\r\nAlso behind the altar of that church is the place where Moses saw our\r\nLord God in a burning bush.  And when the monks enter into that place,\r\nthey do off both hosen and shoon or boots always, because that our Lord\r\nsaid to Moses, Do off thy hosen and thy shoon, for the place that thou\r\nstandest on is land holy and blessed.  And the monks clepe that place\r\nDozoleel, that is to say, the shadow of God.  And beside the high altar,\r\nthree degrees of height is the fertre of alabaster, where the bones of\r\nSaint Catherine lie.  And the prelate of the monks sheweth the relics to\r\nthe pilgrims, and with an instrument of silver he froteth the bones; and\r\nthen there goeth out a little oil, as though it were a manner sweating,\r\nthat is neither like to oil ne to balm, but it is full sweet of smell;\r\nand of that they give a little to the pilgrims, for there goeth out but\r\nlittle quantity of the liquor.  And after that they shew the head of\r\nSaint Catherine, and the cloth that she was wrapped in, that is yet all\r\nbloody; and in that same cloth so wrapped, the angels bare her body to\r\nthe Mount Sinai, and there they buried her with it.  And then they shew\r\nthe bush, that burned and wasted nought, in the which our Lord spake to\r\nMoses, and other relics enough.\r\n\r\nAlso, when the prelate of the abbey is dead, I have understood, by\r\ninformation, that his lamp quencheth.  And when they choose another\r\nprelate, if he be a good man and worthy to be prelate, his lamp shall\r\nlight with the grace of God without touching of any man.  For everych of\r\nthem hath a lamp by himself, and by their lamps they know well when any\r\nof them shall die.  For when any shall die, the light beginneth to change\r\nand to wax dim; and if he be chosen to be prelate, and is not worthy, his\r\nlamp quencheth anon.  And other men have told me, that he that singeth\r\nthe mass for the prelate that is dead—he shall find upon the altar the\r\nname written of him that shall be prelate chosen.  And so upon a day, I\r\nasked of the monks, both one and other, how this befell.  But they would\r\nnot tell me nothing, into the time that I said that they should not hide\r\nthe grace that God did them, but that they should publish it to make the\r\npeople have the more devotion, and that they did sin to hide God’s\r\nmiracle, as me seemed.  For the miracles that God hath done and yet doth\r\nevery day, be the witness of his might and of his marvels, as David saith\r\nin the Psalter: _Mirabilia testimonia tua_, _Domine_, that is to say,\r\n‘Lord thy marvels be thy witness.’  And then they told me, both one and\r\nother, how it befell full many a time, but more I might not have of them.\r\n\r\nIn that abbey ne entereth not no fly, ne toads ne newts, ne such foul\r\nvenomous beasts, ne lice ne fleas, by the miracle of God, and of our\r\nLady.  For there were wont to be so many such manner of filths, that the\r\nmonks were in will to leave the place and the abbey, and were from thence\r\nupon the mountain above to eschew that place; and our Lady came to them\r\nand bade them turn again, and from thence forwards never entered such\r\nfilth in that place amongst them, ne never shall enter hereafter.  Also,\r\nbefore the gate is the well, where Moses smote the stone, of the which\r\nthe water came out plenteously.\r\n\r\nFrom that abbey men go up the mountain of Moses, by many degrees.  And\r\nthere men find first a church of our Lady, where that she met the monks,\r\nwhen they fled away for the vermin above-said.  And more high upon that\r\nmountain is the chapel of Elijah the prophet; and that place they clepe\r\nHoreb, whereof holy writ speaketh, _Et ambulavit in fortitudine cibi\r\nillius usque_, _ad montem Oreb_; that is to say, ‘And he went in strength\r\nof that meat unto the hill of God, Horeb.’  And there nigh is the vine\r\nthat Saint John the Evangelist planted that men clepe raisins of Staphis.\r\nAnd a little above is the chapel of Moses, and the rock where Moses fled\r\nto for dread when he saw our Lord face to face.  And in that rock is\r\nprinted the form of his body, for he smote so strongly and so hard\r\nhimself in that rock, that all his body was dolven within through the\r\nmiracle of God.  And there beside is the place where our Lord took to\r\nMoses the Ten Commandments of the Law.  And there is the cave under the\r\nrock where Moses dwelt, when he fasted forty days and forty nights.  But\r\nhe died in the Land of Promission, and no man knoweth where he was\r\nburied.  And from that mountain men pass a great valley for to go to\r\nanother mountain, where Saint Catherine was buried of the angels of the\r\nLord.  And in that valley is a church of forty martyrs, and there sing\r\nthe monks of the abbey, often-time: and that valley is right cold.  And\r\nafter men go up the mountain of Saint Catherine, that is more high than\r\nthe mount of Moses; and there, where Saint Catherine was buried, is\r\nneither church nor chapel, nor other dwelling place, but there is an heap\r\nof stones about the place, where body of her, was put of the angels.\r\nThere was wont to be a chapel, but it was cast down, and yet lie the\r\nstones there.  And albeit that the Collect of Saint Catherine says, that\r\nit is the place where our Lord betaught the Ten Commandments to Moses,\r\nand there, where the blessed Virgin Saint Catherine was buried, that is\r\nto understand in one country, or in one place bearing one name; for both\r\nthat one and that other is clept the mount of Sinai.  But it is a great\r\nway from that one to that other, and a great deep valley between them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\n\r\n_Of the Desert between the Church of Saint Catherine and Jerusalem_.  _Of\r\nthe Dry Tree_; _and how Roses came first into the World_\r\n\r\nNOW, after that men have visited those holy places, then will they turn\r\ntoward Jerusalem.  And then will they take leave of the monks, and\r\nrecommend themselves to their prayers.  And then they give the pilgrims\r\nof their victuals for to pass with the deserts toward Syria.  And those\r\ndeserts dure well a thirteen journeys.\r\n\r\nIn that desert dwell many of Arabians, that men clepe Bedouins and\r\nAscopards, and they be folk full of all evil conditions.  And they have\r\nnone houses, but tents, that they make of skins of beasts, as of camels\r\nand of other beasts that they eat; and there beneath these they couch\r\nthem and dwell in place where they may find water, as on the Red Sea or\r\nelsewhere: for in that desert is full great default of water, and\r\noften-time it falleth that where men find water at one time in a place it\r\nfaileth another time; and for that skill they make none habitations\r\nthere.  These folk that I speak of, they till not the land, and they\r\nlabour nought; for they eat no bread, but if it be any that dwell nigh a\r\ngood town, that go thither and eat bread sometime.  And they roast their\r\nflesh and their fish upon the hot stones against the sun.  And they be\r\nstrong men and well-fighting; and there so is much multitude of that\r\nfolk, that they be without number.  And they ne reck of nothing, ne do\r\nnot but chase after beasts to eat them.  And they reck nothing of their\r\nlife, and therefore they fear not the sultan, ne no other prince; but\r\nthey dare well war with them, if they do anything that is grievance to\r\nthem.  And they have often-times war with the sultan, and, namely, that\r\ntime that I was with him.  And they bear but one shield and one spear,\r\nwithout other arms; and they wrap their heads and their necks with a\r\ngreat quantity of white linen cloth; and they be right felonous and foul,\r\nand of cursed kind.\r\n\r\nAnd when men pass this desert, in coming toward Jerusalem, they come to\r\nBersabe (Beersheba), that was wont to be a full fair town and a\r\ndelectable of Christian men; and yet there be some of their churches.  In\r\nthat town dwelled Abraham the patriarch, a long time.  That town of\r\nBersabe founded Bersabe (Bathsheba), the wife of Sir Uriah the Knight, on\r\nthe which King David gat Solomen the Wise, that was king after David upon\r\nthe twelve kindreds of Jerusalem and reigned forty year.\r\n\r\nAnd from thence go men to the city of Hebron, that is the mountance of\r\ntwelve good mile.  And it was clept sometime the Vale of Mamre, and\r\nsome-time it was clept the Vale of Tears, because that Adam wept there an\r\nhundred year for the death of Abel his son, that Cain slew.  Hebron was\r\nwont to be the principal city of the Philistines, and there dwelled some\r\ntime the giants.  And that city was also sacerdotal, that is to say,\r\nsanctuary of the tribe of Judah; and it was so free, that men received\r\nthere all manner of fugitives of other places for their evil deeds.  In\r\nHebron Joshua, Caleb and their company came first to aspy, how they might\r\nwin the land of Behest.  In Hebron reigned first king David seven year\r\nand a half; and in Jerusalem he reigned thirty-three year and a half.\r\n\r\nAnd in Hebron be all the sepultures of the patriarchs, Adam, Abraham,\r\nIsaac, and of Jacob; and of their wives, Eve, Sarah and Rebecca, and of\r\nLeah; the which sepultures the Saracens keep full curiously, and have the\r\nplace in great reverence for the holy fathers, the patriarchs that lie\r\nthere.  And they suffer no Christian man to enter into that place, but if\r\nit be of special grace of the sultan; for they hold Christian men and\r\nJews as dogs, and they say, that they should not enter into so holy\r\nplace.  And men clepe that place, where they lie, Double Spelunk, or\r\nDouble Cave, or Double Ditch, forasmuch as that one lieth above that\r\nother.  And the Saracens clepe that place in their language, _Karicarba_,\r\nthat is to say, ‘The Place of Patriarchs.’  And the Jews clepe that place\r\n_Arboth_.  And in that same place was Abraham’s house, and there he sat\r\nand saw three persons, and worshipped but one; as holy writ saith, _Tres\r\nvidit et unum adoravit_, that is to say, ‘He saw three and worshipped\r\none’: and of those same received Abraham the angels into his house.\r\n\r\nAnd right fast by that place is a cave in the rock, where Adam and Eve\r\ndwelled when they were put out of Paradise; and there got they their\r\nchildren.  And in that same place was Adam formed and made, after that\r\nsome men say: (for men were wont for to clepe that place the field of\r\nDamascus, because that it was in the lordship of Damascus), and from\r\nthence was he translated into Paradise of delights, as they say; and\r\nafter that he was driven out of Paradise he was there left.  And the same\r\nday that he was put in Paradise, the same day he was put out, for anon he\r\nsinned.  There beginneth the Vale of Hebron, that dureth nigh to\r\nJerusalem.  There the angel commanded Adam that he should dwell with his\r\nwife Eve, of the which he gat Seth; of which tribe, that is to say\r\nkindred, Jesu Christ was born.\r\n\r\nIn that valley is a field, where men draw out of the earth a thing that\r\nmen clepe cambile, and they eat it instead of spices, and they bear it to\r\nsell.  And men may not make the hole or the cave, where it is taken out\r\nof the earth, so deep or so wide, but that it is, at the year’s end, full\r\nagain up to the sides, through the grace of God.\r\n\r\nAnd two mile from Hebron is the grave of Lot, that was Abraham’s brother.\r\n\r\nAnd a little from Hebron is the mount of Mamre, of the which the valley\r\ntaketh his name.  And there is a tree of oak, that the Saracens clepe\r\n_Dirpe_, that is of Abraham’s time: the which men clepe the Dry Tree.\r\nAnd they say that it hath been there since the beginning of the world,\r\nand was some-time green and bare leaves, unto the time that our Lord died\r\non the cross, and then it dried: and so did all the trees that were then\r\nin the world.  And some say, by their prophecies, that a lord, a prince\r\nof the west side of the world, shall win the Land of Promission that is\r\nthe Holy Land with help of Christian men, and he shall do sing a mass\r\nunder that dry tree; and then the tree shall wax green and bear both\r\nfruit and leaves, and through that miracle many Saracens and Jews shall\r\nbe turned to Christian faith: and, therefore, they do great worship\r\nthereto, and keep it full busily.  And, albeit so, that it be dry,\r\nnatheles yet he beareth great virtue, for certainly he that hath a little\r\nthereof upon him, it healeth him of the falling evil, and his horse shall\r\nnot be a-foundered: and many other virtues it hath; wherefore men hold it\r\nfull precious.\r\n\r\nFrom Hebron men go to Bethlehem in half a day, for it is but five mile;\r\nand it is full fair way, by plains and woods full delectable.  Bethlehem\r\nis a little city, long and narrow and well walled, and in each side\r\nenclosed with good ditches: and it was wont to be clept Ephrata, as holy\r\nwrit saith, _Ecce_, _audivimus eum in Ephrata_, that is to say, ‘Lo, we\r\nheard him in Ephrata.’  And toward the east end of the city is a full\r\nfair church and a gracious, and it hath many towers, pinacles and\r\ncorners, full strong and curiously made; and within that church be\r\nforty-four pillars of marble, great and fair.\r\n\r\nAnd between the city and the church is the field _Floridus_, that is to\r\nsay, the ‘field flourished.’  For as much as a fair maiden was blamed\r\nwith wrong, and slandered that she had done fornication; for which cause\r\nshe was demned to death, and to be burnt in that place, to the which she\r\nwas led.  And, as the fire began to burn about her, she made her prayers\r\nto our Lord, that as wisely as she was not guilty of that sin, that he\r\nwould help her and make it to be known to all men, of his merciful grace.\r\nAnd when she had thus said, she entered into the fire, and anon was the\r\nfire quenched and out; and the brands that were burning became red\r\nrose-trees, and the brands that were not kindled became white rose-trees,\r\nfull of roses.  And these were the first rose-trees and roses, both white\r\nand red, that ever any man saw; and thus was this maiden saved by the\r\ngrace of God.  And therefore is that field clept the field of God\r\nflourished, for it was full of roses.\r\n\r\nAlso beside the choir of the church, at the right side, as men come\r\ndownward sixteen degrees, is the place where our Lord was born, that is\r\nfull well dight of marble, and full richly painted with gold, silver,\r\nazure and other colours.  And three paces beside is the crib of the ox\r\nand the ass.  And beside that is the place where the star fell, that led\r\nthe three kings, Jaspar, Melchior and Balthazar: but men of Greece clepe\r\nthem thus, _Galgalath_, _Malgalath_, and _Seraphie_, and the Jews clepe\r\nthem, in this manner, in Hebrew, _Appelius_, _Amerrius_, and _Damasus_.\r\nThese three kings offered to our Lord, gold, incense and myrrh, and they\r\nmet together through miracle of God; for they met together in a city in\r\nInd, that men clepe Cassak, that is a fifty-three journeys from\r\nBethlehem; and they were at Bethlehem the thirteenth day; and that was\r\nthe fourth day after that they had seen the star, when they met in that\r\ncity, and thus they were in nine days from that city at Bethlehem, and\r\nthat was great miracle.\r\n\r\nAlso, under the cloister of the church, by eighteen degrees at the right\r\nside, is the charnel of the Innocents, where their bones lie.  And before\r\nthe place where our Lord was born is the tomb of Saint Jerome, that was a\r\npriest and a cardinal, that translated the Bible and the Psalter from\r\nHebrew into Latin: and without the minster is the chair that he sat in\r\nwhen he translated it.  And fast beside that church, a sixty fathom, is a\r\nchurch of Saint Nicholas, where our Lady rested her after she was lighted\r\nof our Lord; and forasmuch as she had too much milk in her paps, that\r\ngrieved her, she milked them on the red stones of marble, so that the\r\ntraces may yet be seen, in the stones, all white.\r\n\r\nAnd ye shall understand, that all that dwell in Bethlehem be Christian\r\nmen.\r\n\r\nAnd there be fair vines about the city, and great plenty of wine, that\r\nthe Christian men have do let make.  But the Saracens ne till not no\r\nvines, ne they drink no wine: for their books of their law, that Mahomet\r\nbetoke them, which they clepe their _Al Koran_, and some clepe it\r\n_Mesaph_, and in another language it is clept _Harme_, and the same book\r\nforbiddeth them to drink wine.  For in that book, Mahomet cursed all\r\nthose that drink wine and all them that sell it: for some men say, that\r\nhe slew once an hermit in his drunkenness, that he loved full well; and\r\ntherefore he cursed wine and them that drink it.  But his curse be turned\r\non to his own head, as holy writ saith, _Et in virticem ipsius iniquitas\r\nejus descendet_, that is for to say, ‘His wickedness shall turn and fall\r\nin his own head.’\r\n\r\nAnd also the Saracens bring forth no pigs, nor they eat no swine’s flesh,\r\nfor they say it is brother to man, and it was forbidden by the old law;\r\nand they hold him all accursed that eat thereof.  Also in the land of\r\nPalestine and in the land of Egypt, they eat but little or none of flesh\r\nof veal or of beef, but if be so old, that he may no more travel for old;\r\nfor it is forbidden, and for because they have but few of them; therefore\r\nthey nourish them for to ere their lands.\r\n\r\nIn this city of Bethlehem was David the king born; and he had sixty\r\nwives, and the first wife was called Michal; and also he had three\r\nhundred lemans.\r\n\r\nAnd from Bethlehem unto Jerusalem is but two mile; and in the way to\r\nJerusalem half a mile from Bethlehem is a church, where the angel said to\r\nthe shepherds of the birth of Christ.  And in that way is the tomb of\r\nRachel, that was Joseph’s mother, the patriarch; and she died anon after\r\nthat she was delivered of her son Benjamin.  And there she was buried of\r\nJacob her husband, and he let set twelve great stones on her, in token\r\nthat she had born twelve children.  In the same way, half mile from\r\nJerusalem, appeared the star to the three kings.  In that way also be\r\nmany churches of Christian men, by the which men go towards the city of\r\nJerusalem.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\n\r\n  _Of the Pilgrimages in Jerusalem_, _and of the Holy Places thereabout_\r\n\r\nAFTER, for to speak of Jerusalem the holy city: ye shall understand, that\r\nit stands full fair between hills, and there be no rivers ne wells, but\r\nwater cometh by conduit from Hebron.  And ye shall understand, that\r\nJerusalem of old time, unto the time of Melchisadech, was clept Jebus;\r\nand after it was clept Salem, unto the time of King David, that put these\r\ntwo names together, and clept it Jebusalem; and after that, King Solomon\r\nclept it Jerosolomye; and after that, men clept it Jerusalem, and so it\r\nis clept yet.\r\n\r\nAnd about Jerusalem is the kingdom of Syria.  And there beside is the\r\nland of Palestine, and beside it is Ascalon, and beside that is the land\r\nof Maritaine.  But Jerusalem is in the land of Judea, and it is clept\r\nJudea, for that Judas Maccabeus was king of that country; and it marcheth\r\neastward to the kingdom of Arabia; on the south side to the land of\r\nEgypt; and on the west side to the Great Sea; on the north side, towards\r\nthe kingdom of Syria and to the sea of Cyprus.  In Jerusalem was wont to\r\nbe a patriarch; and archbishops and bishops about in the country.  About\r\nJerusalem be these cities: Hebron, at seven mile; Jericho, at six mile;\r\nBeersheba, at eight mile; Ascalon, at seventeen mile; Jaffa, at sixteen\r\nmile; Ramath, at three mile; and Bethlehem, at two mile.  And a two mile\r\nfrom Bethlehem, toward the south, is the Church of St. Karitot, that was\r\nabbot there, for whom they made much dole amongst the monks when he\r\nshould die; and yet they be in mourning in the wise that they made their\r\nlamentation for him the first time; and it is full great pity to behold.\r\n\r\nThis country and land of Jerusalem hath been in many divers nations’\r\nhands, and often, therefore, hath the country suffered much tribulation\r\nfor the sin of the people that dwell there.  For that country hath been\r\nin the hands of all nations; that is to say, of Jews, of Canaanites,\r\nAssyrians, Persians, Medes, Macedonians, of Greeks, Romans, of Christian\r\nmen, of Saracens, Barbarians, Turks, Tartars, and of many other divers\r\nnations; for God will not that it be long in the hands of traitors ne of\r\nsinners, be they Christian or other.  And now have the heathen men held\r\nthat land in their hands forty year and more; but they shall not hold it\r\nlong, if God will.\r\n\r\nAnd ye shall understand, that when men come to Jerusalem, their first\r\npilgrimage is to the Church of the Holy Sepulchre, where our Lord was\r\nburied, that is without the city on the north side; but it is now\r\nenclosed in with the town wall.  And there is a full fair church, all\r\nround, and open above, and covered with lead; and on the west side is a\r\nfair tower and an high for bells, strongly made.\r\n\r\nAnd in the midst of the church is a tabernacle, as it were a little\r\nhouse, made with a low little door, and that tabernacle is made in manner\r\nof half a compass, right curiously and richly made of gold and azure and\r\nother rich colours full nobly made.  And in the right side of that\r\ntabernacle is the sepulchre of our Lord; and the tabernacle is eight foot\r\nlong, and five foot wide, and eleven foot in height.  And it is not long\r\nsith the sepulchre was all open, that men might kiss it and touch it; but\r\nfor pilgrims that came thither pained them to break the stone in pieces\r\nor in powder, therefore the soldan hath do make a wall about the\r\nsepulchre that no man may touch it: but in the left side of the wall of\r\nthe tabernacle is, well the height of a man, a great stone to the\r\nquantity of a man’s head, that was of the holy sepulchre; and that stone\r\nkiss the pilgrims that come thither.  In that tabernacle be no windows,\r\nbut it is all made light with lamps that hang before the sepulchre.  And\r\nthere is a lamp that hangeth before the sepulchre, that burneth light;\r\nand on the Good Friday it goeth out by himself, [and lighteth again by\r\nhim self] at that hour that our Lord rose from death to life.\r\n\r\nAlso within the church, at the right side, beside the choir of the\r\nchurch, is the mount of Calvary, where our Lord was put on the cross; and\r\nit is a rock of white colour and a little medled with red.  And the cross\r\nwas set in a mortise in the same rock.  And on that rock dropped the\r\nwounds of our Lord when he was pined on the cross.  And that is clept\r\nGolgotha.\r\n\r\nAnd men go up to that Golgotha by degrees; and in the place of that\r\nmortise was Adam’s head found after Noah’s flood, in token that the sins\r\nof Adam should be bought in that same place.  And upon that rock made\r\nAbraham sacrifice to our Lord.  And there is an altar; and before that\r\naltar lie Godefray de Bouillon and Baldwin, and other Christian kings of\r\nJerusalem.\r\n\r\nAnd there, nigh where our Lord was crucified, is this written in Greek:\r\n\r\n    † Ο θεὸς Βασιλεῦς ἡμῶν πρὸ αἰώνων εἰργάσατο σωτηρίαν ἐν μέσῳ τῆς γῆς;\r\n\r\nthat is to say, in Latin,—\r\n\r\n    _Deus Rex noster ante secula operatus est salutem_, _in medio\r\n    terrae_;\r\n\r\nthat is to say,—\r\n\r\n    _This God our King_, _before the worlds_, _hath wrought health in\r\n    midst of the earth_.\r\n\r\nAnd also on that rock, where the cross was set, is written within the\r\nrock these words:\r\n\r\n    † Ο ἕιδεις, ἐστί Βάσις τῆς πίστεως ὅλης τοῦ κόσμου τούτου;\r\n\r\nthat is to say, in Latin,—\r\n\r\n    _Quod vides_, _est fundamentum totius fidei mundi hujus_;\r\n\r\nthat is to say,—\r\n\r\n    † _That thou seest_, _is the ground of all the faith of this world_.\r\n\r\nAnd ye shall understand, that when our Lord was done upon the cross, he\r\nwas thirty-three year and three months of old.  And the prophecy of David\r\nsaith thus: _Quadraginta annis proximus fui generationi huic_; that is to\r\nsay, ‘Forty year was I neighbour to this kindred.’  And thus should it\r\nseem that the prophecies were not true.  But they be both true; for in\r\nold time men made a year of ten months, of the which March was the first\r\nand December was the last.  But Gaius, that was Emperor of Rome, put\r\nthese two months thereto, January and February, and ordained the year of\r\ntwelve months; that is to say, 365 days, without leap year, after the\r\nproper course of the sun.  And therefore after counting of ten months of\r\nthe year, he died in the fortieth year, as the prophet said.  And after\r\nthe year of twelve months, he was of age thirty-three year and three\r\nmonths.\r\n\r\nAlso, within the mount of Calvary, on the right side, is an altar, where\r\nthe pillar lieth that our Lord Jesu was bounden to when he was scourged.\r\nAnd there beside be four pillars of stone, that always drop water; and\r\nsome men say that they weep for our Lord’s death.  And nigh that altar is\r\na place under earth forty-two degrees of deepness, where the holy cross\r\nwas found, by the wit of Saint Helen, under a rock where the Jews had hid\r\nit.  And that was the very cross assayed; for they found three crosses,\r\none of our Lord, and two of the two thieves; and Saint Helen proved them\r\nby a dead body that arose from death to life, when that it was laid on\r\nit, that our Lord died on.  And thereby in the wall is the place where\r\nthe four nails of our Lord were hid: for he had two in his hands and two\r\nin his feet.  And, of one of these, the Emperor of Constantinople made a\r\nbridle to his horse to bear him in battle; and, through virtue thereof,\r\nhe overcame his enemies, and won all the land of Asia the less, that is\r\nto say, Turkey, Armenia the less and the more, and from Syria to\r\nJerusalem, from Arabia to Persia, from Mesopotamia to the kingdom of\r\nAleppo, from Egypt the high and the low and all the other kingdoms unto\r\nthe depth of Ethiopia, and into Ind the less that then was Christian.\r\n\r\nAnd there were in that time many good holy men and holy hermits, of whom\r\nthe book of Father’s lives speaketh, and they be now in Paynims’ and\r\nSaracens’ hands: but when God Almighty will, right as the lands were lost\r\nthrough sin of Christian men, so shall they be won again by Christian men\r\nthrough help of God.\r\n\r\nAnd in midst of that church is a compass, in the which Joseph of\r\nArimathea laid the body of our Lord when he had taken him down off the\r\ncross; and there he washed the wounds of our Lord.  And that compass, say\r\nmen, is the midst of the world.\r\n\r\nAnd in the church of the sepulchre, on the north side, is the place where\r\nour Lord was put in prison (for he was in prison in many places); and\r\nthere is a part of the chain that he was bounden with; and there he\r\nappeared first to Mary Magdalene when he was risen, and she wend that he\r\nhad been a gardener.\r\n\r\nIn the church of Saint Sepulchre was wont to be canons of the order of\r\nSaint Augustine, and had a prior, but the patriarch was their sovereign.\r\n\r\nAnd without the doors of the church, on the right side as men go upward\r\neighteen grees, said our Lord to his mother, _Mulier_, _ecce Filius\r\ntuus_; that is to say, Woman, lo! thy Son!  And after that he said to\r\nJohn, his disciple, _Ecce mater tua_; that is to say, Lo! behold thy\r\nmother!  And these words he said on the cross.  And on these grees went\r\nour Lord when he bare the cross on his shoulder.  And under these grees\r\nis a chapel, and in that chapel sing priests, Indians, that is to say,\r\npriests of Ind, not after our law, but after theirs; and alway they make\r\ntheir sacrament of the altar, saying, _Pater Noster_ and other prayers\r\ntherewith; with the which prayers they say the words that the sacrament\r\nis made of, for they ne know not the additions that many popes have made;\r\nbut they sing with good devotion.  And there near, is the place where\r\nthat our Lord rested him when he was weary for bearing of the cross.\r\n\r\nAnd ye shall understand that before the church of the sepulchre is the\r\ncity more feeble than in any other part, for the great plain that is\r\nbetween the church and the city.  And toward the east side, without the\r\nwalls of the city, is the vale of Jehosaphat that toucheth to the walls\r\nas though it were a large ditch.  And above that vale of Jehosaphat, out\r\nof the city, is the church of Saint Stephen where he was stoned to death.\r\nAnd there beside, is the Golden Gate, that may not be opened, by the\r\nwhich gate our Lord entered on Palm-Sunday upon an ass: and the gate\r\nopened against him when he would go unto the temple; and yet appear the\r\nsteps of the ass’s feet in three places of the degrees that be of full\r\nhard stone.\r\n\r\nAnd before the church of Saint Sepulchre, toward the south, at 200 paces,\r\nis the great hospital of Saint John, of which the hospitallers had their\r\nfoundation.  And within the palace of the sick men of that hospital be\r\n124 pillars of stone.  And in the walls of the house, without the number\r\nabove-said, there be fifty-four pillars that bear up the house.  And from\r\nthat hospital to go toward the east is a full fair church, that is clept\r\n_Nôtre Dame la Grande_.  And then is there another church right nigh,\r\nthat is clept _Nôtre Dame de Latine_.  And there were Mary Cleophas and\r\nMary Magdalene, and tore their hair when our Lord was pained in the\r\ncross.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\n\r\n_Of the Temple of our Lord_.  _Of the Cruelty of King Herod_.  _Of the\r\nMount Sion_.  _Of Probatica Piscina_; _and of Natatorium Siloe_\r\n\r\nAND from the church of the sepulchre, toward the east, at eight score\r\npaces, is _Templum Domini_.  It is right a fair house, and it is all\r\nround and high, and covered with lead.  And it is well paved with white\r\nmarble.  But the Saracens will not suffer no Christian man ne Jews to\r\ncome therein, for they say that none so foul sinful men should not come\r\nin so holy place: but I came in there and in other places there I would,\r\nfor I had letters of the soldan with his great seal, and commonly other\r\nmen have but his signet.  In the which letters he commanded, of his\r\nspecial grace, to all his subjects, to let me see all the places, and to\r\ninform me pleinly all the mysteries of every place, and to conduct me\r\nfrom city to city, if it were need, and buxomly to receive me and my\r\ncompany, and for to obey to all my requests reasonable if they were not\r\ngreatly against the royal power and dignity of the soldan or of his law.\r\nAnd to others, that ask him grace, such as have served him, he ne giveth\r\nnot but his signet, the which they make to be borne before them hanging\r\non a spear.  And the folk of the country do great worship and reverence\r\nto his signet or seal, and kneel thereto as lowly as we do to _Corpus\r\nDomini_.  And yet men do full greater reverence to his letters; for the\r\nadmiral and all other lords that they be shewed to, before or they\r\nreceive them, they kneel down; and then they take them and put them on\r\ntheir heads; and after, they kiss them and then they read them, kneeling\r\nwith great reverence; and then they offer them to do all that the bearer\r\nasketh.\r\n\r\nAnd in this _Templum Domini_ were some-time canons regulars, and they had\r\nan abbot to whom they were obedient; and in this temple was Charlemagne\r\nwhen that the angel brought him the prepuce of our Lord Jesus Christ of\r\nhis circumcision; and after, King Charles let bring it to Paris into his\r\nchapel, and after that he let bring it to Peyteres, and after that to\r\nChartres.\r\n\r\nAnd ye shall understand, that this is not the temple that Solomon made,\r\nfor that temple dured not but 1102 year.  For Titus, Vespasian’s son,\r\nEmperor of Rome, had laid siege about Jerusalem for to discomfit the\r\nJews; for they put our Lord to death, without leave of the emperor.  And,\r\nwhen he had won the city, he burnt the temple and beat it down, and all\r\nthe city, and took the Jews and did them to death—1,100,000; and the\r\nothers he put in prison and sold them to servage,—thirty for one penny;\r\nfor they said they bought Jesu for thirty pennies, and he made of them\r\nbetter cheap when he gave thirty for one penny.\r\n\r\nAnd after that time, Julian Apostate, that was emperor, gave leave to the\r\nJews to make the temple of Jerusalem, for he hated Christian men.  And\r\nyet he was christened, but he forsook his law, and became a renegade.\r\nAnd when the Jews had made the temple, came an earthquaking, and cast it\r\ndown (as God would) and destroyed all that they had made.\r\n\r\nAnd after that, Adrian, that was Emperor of Rome, and of the lineage of\r\nTroy, made Jerusalem again and the temple in the same manner as Solomon\r\nmade it.  And he would not suffer no Jews to dwell there, but only\r\nChristian men.  For although it were so that he was not christened, yet\r\nhe loved Christian men more than any other nation save his own.  This\r\nemperor let enclose the church of Saint Sepulchre, and walled it within\r\nthe city; that, before, was without the city, long time before.  And he\r\nwould have changed the name of Jerusalem, and have clept it Aelia; but\r\nthat name lasted not long.\r\n\r\nAlso, ye shall understand, that the Saracens do much reverence to that\r\ntemple, and they say, that that place is right holy.  And when they go in\r\nthey go bare-foot, and kneel many times.  And when my fellows and I saw\r\nthat, when we came in we did off our shoes and came in bare-foot, and\r\nthought that we should do as much worship and reverence thereto, as any\r\nof the misbelieving men should, and as great compunction in heart to\r\nhave.\r\n\r\nThis temple is sixty-four cubits of wideness, and as many in length; and\r\nof height it is six score cubits.  And it is within, all about, made with\r\npillars of marble.  And in the middle place of the temple be many high\r\nstages, of fourteen degrees of height, made with good pillars all about:\r\nand this place the Jews call _Sancta Sanctorum_; that is to say, ‘Holy of\r\nHallows.’  And, in that place, cometh no man save only their prelate,\r\nthat maketh their sacrifice.  And the folk stand all about, in diverse\r\nstages, after they be of dignity or of worship, so that they all may see\r\nthe sacrifice.  And in that temple be four entries, and the gates be of\r\ncypress, well made and curiously dight: and within the east gate our Lord\r\nsaid, ‘Here is Jerusalem.’  And in the north side of that temple, within\r\nthe gate, there is a well, but it runneth nought, of the which holy writ\r\nspeaketh of and saith, _Vidi aquam egredientem de templo_; that is to\r\nsay, ‘I saw water come out of the temple.’\r\n\r\nAnd on that other side of the temple there is a rock that men clepe\r\nMoriach, but after it was clept Bethel, where the ark of God with relics\r\nof Jews were wont to be put.  That ark or hutch with the relics Titus led\r\nwith him to Rome, when he had discomfited all the Jews.  In that ark were\r\nthe Ten Commandments, and of Aaron’s yard, and Moses’ yard with the which\r\nhe made the Red Sea depart, as it had been a wall, on the right side and\r\non the left side, whiles that the people of Israel passed the sea\r\ndry-foot: and with that yard he smote the rock, and the water came out of\r\nit: and with that yard he did many wonders.  And therein was a vessel of\r\ngold full of manna, and clothing and ornaments and the tabernacle of\r\nAaron, and a tabernacle square of gold with twelve precious stones, and a\r\nbox of jasper green with four figures and eight names of our Lord, and\r\nseven candlesticks of gold, and twelve pots of gold, and four censers of\r\ngold, and an altar of gold, and four lions of gold upon the which they\r\nbare cherubin of gold twelve spans long, and the circle of swans of\r\nheaven with a tabernacle of gold and a table of silver, and two trumps of\r\nsilver, and seven barley loaves and all the other relics that were before\r\nthe birth of our Lord Jesu Christ.\r\n\r\nAnd upon that rock was Jacob sleeping when he saw the angels go up and\r\ndown by a ladder, and he said, _Vere locus iste sanctus est_, _et ego\r\nignorabam_; that is to say, ‘Forsooth this place is holy, and I wist it\r\nnought.’  And there an angel held Jacob still, and turned his name, and\r\nclept him Israel.  And in that same place David saw the angel that smote\r\nthe folk with a sword, and put it up bloody in the sheath.  And in that\r\nsame rock was Saint Simeon when he received our Lord into the temple.\r\nAnd in this rock he set him when the Jews would have stoned him; and a\r\nstar came down and gave him light.  And upon that rock preached our Lord\r\noften-time to the people.  And out that said temple our Lord drove out\r\nthe buyers and the sellers.  And upon that rock our Lord set him when the\r\nJews would have stoned him; and the rock clave in two, and in that\r\ncleaving was our Lord hid, and there came down a star and gave light and\r\nserved him with clarity.  And upon that rock sat our Lady, and learned\r\nher psalter.  And there our Lord forgave the woman her sins, that was\r\nfound in avowtry.  And there was our Lord circumcised.  And there the\r\nangels shewed tidings to Zacharias of the birth of Saint Baptist his son.\r\nAnd there offered first Melchisadech bread and wine to our Lord, in token\r\nof the sacrament that was to come.  And there fell David praying to our\r\nLord and to the angel that smote the people, that he would have mercy on\r\nhim and on the people: and our Lord heard his prayer, and therefore would\r\nhe make the temple in that place, but our Lord forbade him by an angel;\r\nfor he had done treason when he let slay Uriah the worthy knight, for to\r\nhave Bathsheba his wife.  And therefore, all the purveyance that he had\r\nordained to make the temple with he took it Solomon his son, and he made\r\nit.  And he prayed our Lord, that all those that prayed to him in that\r\nplace with good heart—that he would hear their prayer and grant it them\r\nif they asked it rightfully: and our Lord granted it him, and therefore\r\nSolomon clept that temple the Temple of Counsel and of Help of God.\r\n\r\nAnd without the gate of that temple is an altar where Jews were in wont\r\nto offer doves and turtles.  And between the temple and that altar was\r\nZacharias slain.  And upon the pinnacle of that temple was our Lord\r\nbrought for to be tempted of the enemy, the fiend.  And on the height of\r\nthat pinnacle the Jews set Saint James, and cast him down to the earth,\r\nthat first was Bishop of Jerusalem.  And at the entry of that temple,\r\ntoward the west, is the gate that is clept _Porta Speciosa_.  And nigh\r\nbeside that temple, upon the right side, is a church, covered with lead,\r\nthat is clept Solomon’s School.\r\n\r\nAnd from that temple towards the south, right nigh, is the temple of\r\nSolomon, that is right fair and well polished.  And in that temple dwell\r\nthe Knights of the Temple that were wont to be clept Templars; and that\r\nwas the foundation of their order, so that there dwelled knights and in\r\n_Templo Domini_ canons regulars.\r\n\r\nFrom that temple toward the east, a six score paces, in the corner of the\r\ncity, is the bath of our Lord; and in that bath was wont to come water\r\nfrom Paradise, and yet it droppeth.  And there beside is our Lady’s bed.\r\nAnd fast by is the temple of Saint Simeon, and without the cloister of\r\nthe temple, toward the north, is a full fair church of Saint Anne, our\r\nLady’s mother; and there was our Lady conceived; and before that church\r\nis a great tree that began to grow the same night.  And under that\r\nchurch, in going down by twenty-two degrees, lieth Joachim, our Lady’s\r\nfather, in a fair tomb of stone; and there beside lay some-time Saint\r\nAnne, his wife; but Saint Helen let translate her to Constantinople.  And\r\nin that church is a well, in manner of a cistern, that is clept\r\n_Probatica Piscina_, that hath five entries.  Into that well angels were\r\nwont to come from heaven and bathe them within.  And what man, that first\r\nbathed him after the moving of the water, was made whole of what manner\r\nof sickness that he had.  And there our Lord healed a man of the palsy\r\nthat lay thirty-eight year, and our Lord said to him, _Tolle grabatum\r\ntuum et ambula_, that is to say, ‘Take thy bed and go.’  And there beside\r\nwas Pilate’s house.\r\n\r\nAnd fast by is King Herod’s house, that let slay the innocents.  This\r\nHerod was over-much cursed and cruel.  For first he let slay his wife\r\nthat he loved right well; and for the passing love that he had to her\r\nwhen he saw her dead, he fell in a rage and out of his wit a great while;\r\nand sithen he came again to his wit.  And after he let slay his two sons\r\nthat he had of that wife.  And after that he let slay another of his\r\nwives, and a son that he had with her.  And after that he let slay his\r\nown mother; and he would have slain his brother also, but he died\r\nsuddenly.  And after that he did all the harm that he could or might.\r\nAnd after he fell into sickness; and when he felt that he should die, he\r\nsent after his sister and after all the lords of his land; and when they\r\nwere come he let command them to prison.  And then he said to his sister,\r\nhe wist well that men of the country would make no sorrow for his death;\r\nand therefore he made his sister swear that she should let smite off all\r\nthe heads of the lords when he were dead; and then should all the land\r\nmake sorrow for his death, and else, nought; and thus he made his\r\ntestament.  But his sister fulfilled not his will.  For, as soon as he\r\nwas dead, she delivered all the lords out of prison and let them go, each\r\nlord to his own, and told them all the purpose of her brother’s\r\nordinance.  And so was this cursed king never made sorrow for, as he\r\nsupposed for to have been.  And ye shall understand, that in that time\r\nthere were three Herods, of great name and fame for their cruelty.  This\r\nHerod, of which I have spoken of was Herod Ascalonite; and he that let\r\nbehead Saint John the Baptist was Herod Antipas; and he that let smite\r\noff Saint James’s head was Herod Agrippa, and he put Saint Peter in\r\nprison.\r\n\r\nAlso, furthermore, in the city is the church of Saint Saviour; and there\r\nis the left arm of John Chrisostome, and the more part of the head of\r\nSaint Stephen.  And on that other side in the street, toward the south as\r\nmen go to Mount Sion, is a church of Saint James, where he was beheaded.\r\n\r\nAnd from that church, a six score paces, is the Mount Sion.  And there is\r\na fair church of our Lady, where she dwelled; and there she died.  And\r\nthere was wont to be an abbot of canons regulars.  And from thence was\r\nshe borne of the apostles unto the vale of Jehosaphat.  And there is the\r\nstone that the angel brought to our Lord from the mount of Sinai, and it\r\nis of that colour that the rock is of Saint Catherine.  And there beside\r\nis the gate where through our Lady went, when she was with child, when\r\nshe went to Bethlehem.  Also at the entry of the Mount Sion is a chapel.\r\nAnd in that chapel is the stone, great and large, with the which the\r\nsepulchre was covered with, when Joseph of Arimathea had put our Lord\r\ntherein; the which stone the three Marys saw turn upward when they came\r\nto the sepulchre the day of his resurrection, and there found an angel\r\nthat told them of our Lord’s uprising from death to life.  And there also\r\nis a stone in the wall, beside the gate, of the pillar that our Lord was\r\nscourged at.  And there was Annas’s house, that was bishop of the Jews in\r\nthat time.  And there was our Lord examined in the night, and scourged\r\nand smitten and villainous entreated.  And that same place Saint Peter\r\nforsook our Lord thrice or the cock crew.  And there is a part of the\r\ntable that he made his supper on, when he made his maundy with his\r\ndisciples, when he gave them his flesh and his blood in form of bread and\r\nwine.\r\n\r\nAnd under that chapel, thirty-two degrees, is the place where our Lord\r\nwashed his disciples’ feet, and yet is the vessel where the water was.\r\nAnd there beside that same vessel was Saint Stephen buried.  And there is\r\nthe altar where our Lady heard the angels sing mass.  And there appeared\r\nfirst our Lord to his disciples after his resurrection, the gates\r\nenclosed, and said to them, _Pax vobis_! that is to say, ‘Peace to you!’\r\nAnd on that mount appeared Christ to Saint Thomas the apostle and bade\r\nhim assay his wounds; and then believed he first, and said, _Dominus meus\r\net Deus meus_! that is to say ‘My Lord and my God!’  In the same church,\r\nbeside the altar, were all the apostles on Whitsunday, when the Holy\r\nGhost descended on them in likeness of fire.  And there made our Lord his\r\npasque with his disciples.  And there slept Saint John the evangelist\r\nupon the breast of our Lord Jesu Christ, and saw sleeping many heavenly\r\nprivities.\r\n\r\nMount Sion is within the city, and it is a little higher than the other\r\nside of the city; and the city is stronger on that side than on that\r\nother side.  For at the foot of the Mount Sion is a fair castle and a\r\nstrong that the soldan let make.  In the Mount Sion were buried King\r\nDavid and King Solomon, and many other kings, Jews of Jerusalem.  And\r\nthere is the place where the Jews would have cast up the body of our Lady\r\nwhen the apostles bare the body to be buried in the vale of Jehosaphat.\r\nAnd there is the place where Saint Peter wept full tenderly after that he\r\nhad forsaken our Lord.  And a stone’s cast from that chapel is another\r\nchapel, where our Lord was judged, for that time was there Caiaphas’s\r\nhouse.  From that chapel, to go toward the east, at seven score paces, is\r\na deep cave under the rock, that is clept the Galilee of our Lord, where\r\nSaint Peter hid him when he had forsaken our Lord.  _Item_, between the\r\nMount Sion and the Temple of Solomon is the place where our Lord raised\r\nthe maiden in her father’s house.\r\n\r\nUnder the Mount Sion, toward the vale of Jehosaphat, is a well that is\r\nclept _Natatorium Siloe_.  And there was our Lord washed after his\r\nbaptism; and there made our Lord the blind man to see.  And there was\r\ny-buried Isaiah the prophet.  Also, straight from _Natatorium Siloe_, is\r\nan image, of stone and of old ancient work, that Absalom let make, and\r\nbecause thereof men clepe it the hand of Absalom.  And fast by is yet the\r\ntree of elder that Judas hanged himself upon, for despair that he had,\r\nwhen he sold and betrayed our Lord.  And there beside was the synagogue,\r\nwhere the bishops of Jews and the Pharisees came together and held their\r\ncouncil; and there cast Judas the thirty pence before them, and said that\r\nhe had sinned betraying our Lord.  And there nigh was the house of the\r\napostles Philip and Jacob Alphei.  And on that other side of Mount Sion,\r\ntoward the south, beyond the vale a stone’s cast, is Aceldama; that is to\r\nsay, the field of blood, that was bought for the thirty pence, that our\r\nLord was sold for.  And in that field be many tombs of Christian men, for\r\nthere be many pilgrims graven.  And there be many oratories, chapels and\r\nhermitages, where hermits were wont to dwell.  And toward the east, an\r\nhundred paces, is the charnel of the hospital of Saint John, where men\r\nwere wont to put the bones of dead men.\r\n\r\nAlso from Jerusalem, toward the west, is a fair church, where the tree of\r\nthe cross grew.  And two mile from thence is a fair church, where our\r\nLady met with Elizabeth, when they were both with child; and Saint John\r\nstirred in his mother’s womb, and made reverence to his Creator that he\r\nsaw not.  And under the altar of that church is the place where Saint\r\nJohn was born.  And from that church is a mile to the castle of Emmaus:\r\nand there also our Lord shewed him to two of his disciples after his\r\nresurrection.  Also on that other side, 200 paces from Jerusalem, is a\r\nchurch, where was wont to be the cave of the lion.  And under that\r\nchurch, at thirty degrees of deepness, were interred 12,000 martyrs, in\r\nthe time of King Cosdroe that the lion met with, all in a night, by the\r\nwill of God.\r\n\r\nAlso from Jerusalem, two mile, is the Mount Joy, a full fair place and a\r\ndelicious; and there lieth Samuel the prophet in a fair tomb.  And men\r\nclepe it Mount Joy, for it giveth joy to pilgrims’ hearts, because that\r\nthere men see first Jerusalem.\r\n\r\nAlso between Jerusalem and the mount of Olivet is the vale of Jehosaphat,\r\nunder the walls of the city, as I have said before.  And in the midst of\r\nthe vale is a little river that men clepe _Torrens Cedron_, and above it,\r\noverthwart, lay a tree (that the cross was made of) that men yede over\r\non. And fast by it is a little pit in the earth, where the foot of the\r\npillar is yet interred; and there was our Lord first scourged, for he was\r\nscourged and villainously entreated in many places.  Also in the middle\r\nplace of the vale of Jehosaphat is the church of our Lady: and it is of\r\nforty-three degrees under the earth unto the sepulchre of our Lady.  And\r\nour Lady was of age, when she died, seventy-two year.  And beside the\r\nsepulchre of our Lady is an altar, where our Lord forgave Saint Peter all\r\nhis sins.  And from thence, toward the west, under an altar, is a well\r\nthat cometh out of the river of Paradise.  And wit well, that that church\r\nis full low in the earth, and some is all within the earth.  But I\r\nsuppose well, that it was not so founded.  But for because that Jerusalem\r\nhath often-time been destroyed and the walls abated and beten down and\r\ntumbled into the vale, and that they have been so filled again and the\r\nground enhanced; and for that skill is the church so low within the\r\nearth.  And, natheles, men say there commonly, that the earth hath so\r\nbeen cloven sith the time that our Lady was there buried; and yet men say\r\nthere, that it waxeth and groweth every day, without doubt.  In that\r\nchurch were wont to be monks black, that had their abbot.\r\n\r\nAnd beside that church is a chapel, beside the rock that hight\r\nGethsemane.  And there was our Lord kissed of Judas; and there was he\r\ntaken of the Jews.  And there left our Lord his disciples, when he went\r\nto pray before his passion, when he prayed and said, _Pater_, _si fieri\r\npotest_, _transeat a me calix iste_; that is to say, ‘Father, if it may\r\nbe, do let this chalice go from me’: and, when he came again to his\r\ndisciples, he found them sleeping.  And in the rock within the chapel yet\r\nappear the fingers of our Lord’s hand, when he put them in the rock, when\r\nthe Jews would have taken him.\r\n\r\nAnd from thence, a stone’s cast towards the south, is another chapel,\r\nwhere our Lord sweat drops of blood.  And there, right nigh, is the tomb\r\nof King Jehosaphat, of whom the vale beareth the name.  This Jehosaphat\r\nwas king of that country, and was converted by an hermit, that was a\r\nworthy man and did much good.  And from thence, a bow draught towards the\r\nsouth, is the church, where Saint James and Zachariah the prophet were\r\nburied.\r\n\r\nAnd above the vale is the mount of Olivet; and it is clept so for the\r\nplenty of olives that grow there.  That mount is more high than the city\r\nof Jerusalem is; and, therefore, may men upon that mount see many of the\r\nstreets of the city.  And between that mount and the city is not but the\r\nvale of Jehosaphat that is not full large.  And from that mount styed our\r\nLord Jesu Christ to heaven upon Ascension Day; and yet there sheweth the\r\nshape of his left foot in the stone.  And there is a church where was\r\nwont to be an abbot and canons regulars.  And a little thence,\r\ntwenty-eight paces, is a chapel; and therein is the stone on the which\r\nour Lord sat, when he preached the eight blessings and said thus: _Beau\r\npauperes spiritu_: and there he taught his disciples the _Pater Noster_;\r\nand wrote with his finger in a stone.  And there nigh is a church of\r\nSaint Mary Egyptian, and there she lieth in a tomb.  And from thence\r\ntoward the east, a three bow shot, is Bethphage, to the which our Lord\r\nsent Saint Peter and Saint James for to seek the ass upon Palm-Sunday,\r\nand rode upon that ass to Jerusalem.\r\n\r\nAnd in coming down from the mount of Olivet, toward the east, is a castle\r\nthat is clept Bethany.  And there dwelt Simon leprous, and there\r\nharboured our Lord: and after he was baptised of the apostles and was\r\nclept Julian, and was made bishop; and this is the same Julian that men\r\nclepe to for good harbourage, for our Lord harboured with him in his\r\nhouse.  And in that house our Lord forgave Mary Magdalene her sins: there\r\nshe washed his feet with her tears, and wiped them with her hair.  And\r\nthere served Saint Martha our Lord.  There our Lord raised Lazarus from\r\ndeath to life, that was dead four days and stank, that was brother to\r\nMary Magdalene and to Martha.  And there dwelt also Mary Cleophas.  That\r\ncastle is well a mile long from Jerusalem.  Also in coming down from the\r\nmount of Olivet is the place where our Lord wept upon Jerusalem.  And\r\nthere beside is the place where our Lady appeared to Saint Thomas the\r\napostle after her assumption, and gave him her girdle.  And right nigh is\r\nthe stone where our Lord often-time sat upon when he preached; and upon\r\nthat same he shall sit at the day of doom, right as himself said.\r\n\r\nAlso after the mount of Olivet is the mount of Galilee.  There assembled\r\nthe apostles when Mary Magdalene came and told them of Christ’s uprising.\r\nAnd there, between the Mount Olivet and the Mount Galilee, is a church,\r\nwhere the angel said to our Lady of her death.\r\n\r\nAlso from Bethany to Jericho was sometime a little city, but it is now\r\nall destroyed, and now is there but a little village.  That city took\r\nJoshua by miracle of God and commandment of the angel, and destroyed it,\r\nand cursed it and all them that bigged it again.  Of that city was\r\nZaccheus the dwarf that clomb up into the sycamore tree for to see our\r\nLord, because he was so little he might not see him for the people.  And\r\nof that city was Rahab the common woman that escaped alone with them of\r\nher lineage: and she often-time refreshed and fed the messengers of\r\nIsrael, and kept them from many great perils of death; and, therefore,\r\nshe had good reward, as holy writ saith: _Qui accipit prophetam in nomine\r\nmeo_, _mercedem prophetae accipiet_; that is to say, ‘He that taketh a\r\nprophet in my name, he shall take meed of the prophet.’  And so had she.\r\nFor she prophesied to the messengers, saying, _Novi quod Dominus tradet\r\nvobis terram hanc_; that is to say, ‘I wot well, that our Lord shall\r\nbetake you this land’: and so he did.  And after, Salomon, Naasson’s son,\r\nwedded her, and from that time was she a worthy woman, and served God\r\nwell.\r\n\r\nAlso from Bethany go men to flom Jordan by a mountain and through desert.\r\nAnd it is nigh a day journey from Bethany, toward the east, to a great\r\nhill, where our Lord fasted forty days.  Upon that hill the enemy of hell\r\nbare our Lord and tempted him, and said, _Dic ut lapides isti panes\r\nfiant_; that is to say, ‘Say, that these stones be made loaves.’  In that\r\nplace, upon the hill, was wont to be a fair church; but it is all\r\ndestroyed, so that there is now but an hermitage, that a manner of\r\nChristian men hold, that be clept Georgians, for Saint George converted\r\nthem.  Upon that hill dwelt Abraham a great while, and therefore men\r\nclepe it Abraham’s Garden.  And between the hill and this garden runneth\r\na little brook of water that was wont to be bitter; but, by the blessing\r\nof Elisha the prophet, it became sweet and good to drink.  And at the\r\nfoot of this hill, toward the plain, is a great well, that entereth into\r\nfrom Jordan.\r\n\r\nFrom that hill to Jericho, that I spake of before, is but a mile in going\r\ntoward flom Jordan.  Also as men go to Jericho sat the blind man crying,\r\n_Jesu_, _Fili David_, _miserere mei_; that is to say, ‘Jesu, David’s Son,\r\nhave mercy on me.’  And anon he had his sight.  Also, two mile from\r\nJericho, is flome Jordan.  And, an half mile more nigh, is a fair church\r\nof Saint John the Baptist, where he baptised our Lord.  And there beside\r\nis the house of Jeremiah the prophet.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\n\r\n\r\n_Of the Dead Sea_; _and of the Flome Jordan_.  _Of the Head of Saint John\r\nthe Baptist_; _and of the Usages of the Samaritans_\r\n\r\nAND from Jericho, a three mile, is the Dead Sea.  About that sea groweth\r\nmuch alum and of alkatran.  Between Jericho and that sea is the land of\r\nEngeddi.  And there was wont to grow the balm; but men make draw the\r\nbranches thereof and bear them to be grafted at Babylon; and yet men\r\nclepe them vines of Geddi.  At a coast of that sea, as men go from\r\nArabia, is the mount of the Moabites, where there is a cave, that men\r\nclepe Karua.  Upon that hill led Balak, the son of Beor, Balaam the\r\npriest for to curse the people of Israel.\r\n\r\nThat Dead Sea parteth the land of Ind and of Arabia, and that sea lasteth\r\nfrom Soara unto Arabia.  The water of that sea is full bitter and salt,\r\nand, if the earth were made moist and wet with that water, it would never\r\nbear fruit.  And the earth and the land changeth often his colour.  And\r\nit casteth out of the water a thing that men clepe asphalt, also great\r\npieces, as the greatness of an horse, every day and on all sides.  And\r\nfrom Jerusalem to that sea is 200 furlongs.  That sea is in length five\r\nhundred and four score furlongs, and in breadth an hundred and fifty\r\nfurlongs; and it is clept the Dead Sea, for it runneth nought, but is\r\never unmovable.  And neither man, ne beast, ne nothing that beareth life\r\nin him ne may not die in that sea.  And that hath been proved many times,\r\nby men that have deserved to be dead that have been cast therein and left\r\ntherein three days or four, and they ne might never die therein; for it\r\nreceiveth no thing within him that beareth life.  And no man may drink of\r\nthe water for bitterness.  And if a man cast iron therein, it will float\r\nabove.  And if men cast a feather therein, it will sink to the bottom,\r\nand these be things against kind.\r\n\r\nAnd also, the cities there were lost because of sin.  And there beside\r\ngrow trees that bear full fair apples, and fair of colour to behold; but\r\nwhoso breaketh them or cutteth them in two, he shall find within them\r\ncoals and cinders, in token that by wrath of God the cities and the land\r\nwere burnt and sunken into hell.  Some men clepe that sea the lake\r\nDalfetidee; some, the flome of Devils; and some the flome that is ever\r\nstinking.  And into that sea sunk the five cities by wrath of God; that\r\nis to say, Sodom, Gomorrah, Aldama, Zeboim, and Zoar, for the abominable\r\nsin of sodomy that reigned in them.  But Zoar, by the prayer of Lot, was\r\nsaved and kept a great while, for it was set upon a hill; and yet sheweth\r\nthereof some part above the water, and men may see the walls when it is\r\nfair weather and clear.  In that city Lot dwelt a little while; and there\r\nwas he made drunk of his daughters, and lay with them, and engendered of\r\nthem Moab and Ammon.  And the cause why his daughters made him drunk and\r\nfor to lie by him was this: because they saw no man about them, but only\r\ntheir father, and therefore they trowed that God had destroyed all the\r\nworld as he had done the cities, as he had done before by Noah’s flood.\r\nAnd therefore they would lie by with their father for to have issue, and\r\nfor to replenish the world again with people to restore the world again\r\nby them; for they trowed that there had been no more men in all the\r\nworld; and if their father had not been drunk, he had not lain with them.\r\n\r\nAnd the hill above Zoar men cleped it then Edom and after men cleped it\r\nSeir, and after Idumea.  Also at the right side of that Dead Sea,\r\ndwelleth yet the wife of Lot in likeness of a salt stone; for that she\r\nlooked behind her when the cities sunk into hell.  This Lot was Haran’s\r\nson, that was brother to Abraham; and Sarah, Abraham’s wife, and Milcah,\r\nNahor’s wife, were sisters to the said Lot.  And the same Sarah was of\r\neld four score and ten year when Isaac her son was gotten on her.  And\r\nAbraham had another son Ishmael that he gat upon Hagar his chamberer.\r\nAnd when Isaac his son was eight days old, Abraham his father let him be\r\ncircumcised, and Ishmael with him that was fourteen year old: wherefore\r\nthe Jews that come of Isaac’s line be circumcised the eighth day, and the\r\nSaracens that come of Ishmael’s line be circumcised when they be fourteen\r\nyear of age.\r\n\r\nAnd ye shall understand, that within the Dead Sea, runneth the flom\r\nJordan, and there it dieth, for it runneth no further more, and that is a\r\nplace that is a mile from the church of Saint John the Baptist toward the\r\nwest, a little beneath the place where that Christian men bathe them\r\ncommonly.  And a mile from flom Jordan is the river of Jabbok, the which\r\nJacob passed over when he came from Mesopotamia.  This flom Jordan is no\r\ngreat river, but it is plenteous of good fish; and it cometh out of the\r\nhill of Lebanon by two wells that be clept Jor and Dan, and of the two\r\nwells hath it the name.  And it passeth by a lake that is clept Maron.\r\nAnd after it passeth by the sea of Tiberias, and passeth under the hills\r\nof Gilboa; and there is a full fair vale, both on that one side and on\r\nthat other of the same river.  And men go [on] the hills of Lebanon, all\r\nin length unto the desert of Pharan; and those hills part the kingdom of\r\nSyria and the country of Phoenicia; and upon those hills grow trees of\r\ncedar that be full high, and they bear long apples, and as great as a\r\nman’s head.\r\n\r\nAnd also this flom Jordan departeth the land of Galilee and the land of\r\nIdumea and the land of Betron, and that runneth under earth a great way\r\nunto a fair plain and a great that is clept Meldan in Sarmois; that is to\r\nsay, Fair or market in their language, because that there is often fairs\r\nin that plain.  And there becometh the water great and large.  In that\r\nplain is the tomb of Job.\r\n\r\nAnd in that flom Jordan above-said was our Lord baptised of Saint John,\r\nand the voice of God the Father was heard saying: _Hic est Filius meus\r\ndilectus_, _etc._; that is to say, ‘This is my beloved Son, in the which\r\nI am well pleased; hear him!’ and the Holy Ghost alighted upon him in\r\nlikeness of a culver; and so at his baptising was all the whole Trinity.\r\n\r\nAnd through that flome passed the children of Israel, all dry feet; and\r\nthey put stones there in the middle place, in token of the miracle that\r\nthe water withdrew him so.  Also in that flome Jordan Naaman of Syria\r\nbathed him, that was full rich, but he was mesell; and there anon he took\r\nhis health.\r\n\r\nAbout the flome Jordan be many churches where that many Christian men\r\ndwelled.  And nigh thereto is the city of Ai that Joshua assailed and\r\ntook.  Also beyond the flome Jordan is the vale of Mamre, and that is a\r\nfull fair vale.  Also upon the hill that I spake of before, where our\r\nLord fasted forty days, a two mile long from Galilee, is a fair hill and\r\nan high, where the enemy the fiend bare our Lord the third time to tempt\r\nhim, and shewed him all the regions of the world and said, _Hec omnia\r\ntibi dabo_, _si cadens adoraveris me_; that is to say, ‘All this shall I\r\ngive thee, if thou fall and worship me.’\r\n\r\nAlso from the Dead Sea to go eastward, out of the marches of the Holy\r\nLand that is clept the Land of Promission, is a strong castle and a fair,\r\nin an hill that is clept Carak in Sarmois; that is to say, Royally.  That\r\ncastle let make King Baldwin, that was King of France, when he had\r\nconquered that land, and put it into Christian men’s hands for to keep\r\nthat country; and for that cause was it clept the Mount Royal.  And under\r\nit there is a town that hight Sobach, and there, all about, dwell\r\nChristian men, under tribute.\r\n\r\nFrom thence go men to Nazareth, of the which our Lord beareth the\r\nsurname.  And from thence there is three journeys to Jerusalem: and men\r\ngo by the province of Galilee by Ramath, by Sothim and by the high hill\r\nof Ephraim, where Elkanah and Hannah the mother of Samuel the prophet\r\ndwelled.  There was born this prophet; and, after his death, he was\r\nburied at Mount Joy, as I have said you before.\r\n\r\nAnd then go men to Shiloh, where the Ark of God with the relics were kept\r\nlong time under Eli the prophet.  There made the people of Hebron\r\nsacrifice to our Lord, and they yielded up their vows.  And there spake\r\nGod first to Samuel, and shewed him the mutation of Order of Priesthood,\r\nand the mystery of the Sacrament.  And right nigh, on the left side, is\r\nGibeon and Ramah and Benjamin, of the which holy writ speaketh of.\r\n\r\nAnd after men go to Sichem, some-time clept Sichar; and that is in the\r\nprovince of Samaritans.  And there is a full fair vale and a fructuous;\r\nand there is a fair city and a good that men clepe Neople.  And from\r\nthence is a journey to Jerusalem.  And there is the well, where our Lord\r\nspake to the woman of Samaritan.  And there was wont to be a church, but\r\nit is beaten down.  Beside that well King Rehoboam let make two calves of\r\ngold and made them to be worshipped, and put that one at Dan and that\r\nother at Bethel.  And a mile from Sichar is the city of Luz; and in that\r\ncity dwelt Abraham a certain time.  Sichem is a ten mile from Jerusalem,\r\nand it is clept Neople; that is for to say, the New City.  And nigh\r\nbeside is the tomb of Joseph the son of Jacob that governed Egypt: for\r\nthe Jews bare his bones from Egypt and buried them there, and thither go\r\nthe Jews often-time in pilgrimage with great devotion.  In that city was\r\nDinah, Jacob’s daughter, ravished, for whom her brethren slew many\r\npersons and did many harms to the city.  And there beside is the hill of\r\nGerizim, where the Samaritans make their sacrifice: in that hill would\r\nAbraham have sacrificed his son Isaac.  And there beside is the vale of\r\nDotaim, and there is the cistern, where Joseph, was cast in of his\r\nbrethren, which they sold; and that is two mile from Sichar.\r\n\r\nFrom thence go men to Samaria that men clepe now Sebast; and that is the\r\nchief city of that country, and it sits between the hill of Aygnes as\r\nJerusalem doth.  In that city was the sittings of the twelve tribes of\r\nIsrael; but the city is not now so great as it was wont to be.  There was\r\nburied Saint John the Baptist between two prophets, Elisha and Abdon; but\r\nhe was beheaded in the castle of Macharim beside the Dead Sea, and after\r\nhe was translated of his disciples, and buried at Samaria.  And there let\r\nJulianus Apostata dig him up and let burn his bones (for he was at that\r\ntime emperor) and let winnow the ashes in the wind.  But the finger that\r\nshewed our Lord, saying, _Ecce Agnus Dei_; that is to say, ‘Lo! the Lamb\r\nof God,’ that would never burn, but is all whole;—that finger let Saint\r\nThecla, the holy virgin, be born into the hill of Sebast; and there make\r\nmen great feast.\r\n\r\nIn that place was wont to be a fair church; and many other there were;\r\nbut they be all beaten down.  There was wont to be the head of Saint John\r\nBaptist, enclosed in the wall.  But the Emperor Theodosius let draw it\r\nout, and found it wrapped in a little cloth, all bloody; and so he let it\r\nto be born to Constantinople.  And yet at Constantinople is the hinder\r\npart of the head, and the fore part of the head, till under the chin, is\r\nat Rome under the church of Saint Silvester, where be nuns of an hundred\r\norders: and it is yet all broilly, as though it were half-burnt, for the\r\nEmperor Julianus above-said, of his cursedness and malice, let burn that\r\npart with the other bones, and yet it sheweth; and this thing hath been\r\nproved both by popes and by emperors.  And the jaws beneath, that hold to\r\nthe chin, and a part of the ashes and the platter that the head was laid\r\nin, when it was smitten off, is at Genoa; and the Genoese make of it\r\ngreat feast, and so do the Saracens also.  And some men say that the head\r\nof Saint John is at Amiens in Picardy; and other men say that it is the\r\nhead of Saint John the Bishop.  I wot never, but God knoweth; but in what\r\nwise that men worship it, the blessed Saint John holds him a-paid.\r\n\r\nFrom this city of Sebast unto Jerusalem is twelve mile.  And between the\r\nhills of that country there is a well that four sithes in the year\r\nchangeth his colour, sometime green, sometime red, sometime clear and\r\nsometime trouble; and men clepe that well, Job.  And the folk of that\r\ncountry, that men clepe Samaritans, were converted and baptized by the\r\napostles; but they hold not well their doctrine, and always they hold\r\nlaws by themselves, varying from Christian men, from Saracens, Jews and\r\nPaynims.  And the Samaritans lieve well in one God, and they say well\r\nthat there is but only one God, that all formed, and all shall doom; and\r\nthey hold the Bible after the letter, and they use the Psalter as the\r\nJews do.  And they say that they be the right sons of God.  And among all\r\nother folk, they say that they be best beloved of God, and that to them\r\nbelongeth the heritage that God behight to his beloved children.  And\r\nthey have also diverse clothing and shape to look on than other folk\r\nhave; for they wrap their heads in red linen cloth, in difference from\r\nothers.  And the Saracens wrap their heads in white linen cloth; and the\r\nChristian men, that dwell in the country, wrap them in blue of Ind; and\r\nthe Jews in yellow cloth.  In that country dwell many of the Jews, paying\r\ntribute as Christian men do.  And if ye will know the letters that the\r\nJews use they be such, and the names be as they clepe them written above,\r\nin manner of their A. B. C.\r\n\r\n Aleph    Beth     Gymel   Deleth     He       Vau          Zay\r\n\r\n   א        ב        ג        ד        ה        ו            ז\r\n Heth     Thet     Joht     Kapho    Lampd     Mem          Num\r\n\r\n   ח        ט        י        כ        ל        מ            נ\r\nSameth     Ey      Fhee     Sade     Coph     Resch     Son      Tau\r\n\r\n   ס        ע        פ        צ        ק        ר        ש        ת\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\n\r\n_Of the Province of Galilee_, _and where Antichrist shall be born_.  _Of\r\nNazareth_.  _Of the age of Our Lady_.  _Of the Day of Doom_.  _And of the\r\ncustoms of Jacobites_, _Syrians_; _and of the usages of Georgians_\r\n\r\nFROM this country of the Samaritans that I have spoken of before go men\r\nto the plains of Galilee, and men leave the hills on that one part.\r\n\r\nAnd Galilee is one of the provinces of the Holy Land, and in that\r\nprovince is the city of Nain—and Capernaum, and Chorazin and Bethsaida.\r\nIn this Bethsaida was Saint Peter and Saint Andrew born.  And thence, a\r\nfour mile, is Chorazin.  And five mile from Chorazin is the city of Kedar\r\nwhereof the Psalter speaketh: _Et habitavi cum habitantibus Kedar_; that\r\nis for to say, ‘And I have dwelled with the dwelling men in Kedar.’  In\r\nChorazin shall Antichrist be born, as some men say.  And other men say he\r\nshall be born in Babylon; for the prophet saith: _De Babilonia coluber\r\nexest_, _qui totum mundum devorabit_; that is to say ‘Out of Babylon\r\nshall come a worm that shall devour all the world.’  This Antichrist\r\nshall be nourished in Bethsaida, and he shall reign in Capernaum: and\r\ntherefore saith holy writ; _Vae tibi_, _Chorazin_!  _Vae tibi_,\r\n_Bethsaida_!  _Vae tibi_, _Capernaum_! that is to say, ‘Woe be to thee,\r\nChorazin!  Woe to thee, Bethsaida!  Woe to thee, Capernaum.’  And all\r\nthese towns be in the land of Galilee.  And also the Cana of Galilee is\r\nfour mile from Nazareth: of that city was Simon Chananeus and his wife\r\nCanee, of the which the holy evangelist speaketh of.  There did our Lord\r\nthe first miracle at the wedding, when he turned water into wine.\r\n\r\nAnd in the end of Galilee, at the hills, was the Ark of God taken; and on\r\nthat other side is the Mount Endor or Hermon.  And, thereabout, goeth the\r\nBrook of Torrens Kishon; and there beside, Barak, that was Abimelech’s\r\nson with Deborah the prophetess overcame the host of Idumea, when Sisera\r\nthe king was slain of Jael the wife of Heber, and chased beyond the flome\r\nJordan, by strength of sword, Zeeb and Zebah and Zalmunna, and there he\r\nslew them.  Also a five mile from Nain is the city of Jezreel that\r\nsometime was clept Zarim, of the which city Jezabel, the cursed queen,\r\nwas lady and queen, that took away the vine of Naboth by her strength.\r\nFast by that city is the field Megiddo, in the which the King Joram was\r\nslain of the King of Samaria and after was translated and buried in the\r\nMount Sion.\r\n\r\nAnd a mile from Jezreel be the hills of Gilboa, where Saul and Jonathan,\r\nthat were so fair, died; wherefore David cursed them, as holy writ saith:\r\n_Montes Gilboæ_, _nec ros nec pluvia_, _etc._; that is to say, ‘Ye hills\r\nof Gilboa, neither dew ne rain come upon you.’  And a mile from the hills\r\nof Gilboa toward the east is the city of Cyropolis, that was clept before\r\nBethshan; and upon the walls of that city was the head of Saul hanged.\r\n\r\nAfter go men by the hill beside the plains of Galilee unto Nazareth,\r\nwhere was wont to be a great city and a fair; but now there is not but a\r\nlittle village, and houses abroad here and there.  And it is not walled.\r\nAnd it sits in a little valley, and there be hills all about.  There was\r\nour Lady born, but she was gotten at Jerusalem.  And because that our\r\nLady was born at Nazareth, therefore bare our Lord his surname of that\r\ntown.  There took Joseph our Lady to wife, when she was fourteen year of\r\nage.  And there Gabriel greeted our Lady, saying, _Ave gratia plena_,\r\n_Dominus tecum_! that is to say, ‘Hail, full of grace, our Lord is with\r\nthee!’  And this salutation was done in a place of a great altar of a\r\nfair church that was wont to be sometime, but it is now all down, and men\r\nhave made a little receipt, beside a pillar of that church, to receive\r\nthe offerings of pilgrims.  And the Saracens keep that place full dearly,\r\nfor the profit that they have thereof.  And they be full wicked Saracens\r\nand cruel, and more despiteful than in any other place, and have\r\ndestroyed all the churches.  There nigh is Gabriel’s Well, where our Lord\r\nwas wont to bathe him, when he was young, and from that well bare he\r\nwater often-time to his mother.  And in that well she washed often-time\r\nthe clouts of her Son Jesu Christ.  And from Jerusalem unto thither is\r\nthree journeys.  At Nazareth was our Lord nourished.  Nazareth is as much\r\nto say as, ‘Flower of the garden’; and by good skill may it be clept\r\nflower, for there was nourished the flower of life that was Christ Jesu.\r\n\r\nAnd two mile from Nazareth is the city of Sephor, by the way that goeth\r\nfrom Nazareth to Akon.  And an half mile from Nazareth is the Leap of our\r\nLord.  For the Jews led him upon an high rock for to make him leap down,\r\nand have slain him; but Jesu passed amongst them, and leapt upon another\r\nrock, and yet be the steps of his feet seen in the rock, where he\r\nalighted.  And therefore say some men, when they dread them of thieves in\r\nany way, or of enemies; _Jesus autem transiens per medium illorum ibat_;\r\nthat is to say, ‘Jesus, forsooth, passing by the midst of them, he went’:\r\nin token and mind, that our Lord passed through, out the Jews’ cruelty,\r\nand scaped safely from them, so surely may men pass the peril of\r\nthieves’.  And then say men two verses of the Psalter three sithes:\r\n_Irruat super eos formido & pavor_, _in magnitudine brachii tui_,\r\n_Domine_.  _Fiant immobiles_, _quasi lapis_, _donec pertranseat populus\r\ntuus_, _Domine_; _donec pertranseat populus tuus iste_, _quem\r\npossedisti_; and then may men pass without peril.\r\n\r\nAnd ye shall understand, that our Lady had child when she was fifteen\r\nyear old.  And she was conversant with her son thirty-three year and\r\nthree months.  And after the passion of our Lord she lived twenty-four\r\nyear.\r\n\r\nAlso from Nazareth men go to the Mount Tabor; and that is a four mile.\r\nAnd it is a full fair hill and well high, where was wont to be a town and\r\nmany churches; but they be all destroyed.  But yet there is a place that\r\nmen clepe the school of God, where he was wont to teach his disciples,\r\nand told them the privities of heaven.  And, at the foot of that hill,\r\nMelchisedech that was King of Salem, in the turning of that hill met\r\nAbraham in coming again from the battle, when he had slain Abimelech.\r\nAnd this Melchisedech was both king and priest of Salem that now is clept\r\nJerusalem.  In that hill Tabor our Lord transfigured him before Saint\r\nPeter, Saint John and Saint Jame; and there they saw, ghostly, Moses and\r\nElias the prophets beside them.  And therefore said Saint Peter;\r\n_Domine_, _bonum est nos hic esse_; _faciamus hic tria tabernacula_; that\r\nis to say, ‘Lord, it is good for us to be here; make we here three\r\ndwelling-places.’  And there heard they a voice of the Father that say;\r\n_Hic est Filius meus dilectus_, _in quo mihi bene complacui_.  And our\r\nLord defended them that they should not tell that avision till that he\r\nwere risen from death to life.\r\n\r\nIn that hill and in that same place, at the day of doom, four angels with\r\nfour trumpets shall blow and raise all men that had suffered death, sith\r\nthat the world was formed, from death to life; and shall come in body and\r\nsoul in judgment, before the face of our Lord in the Vale of Jehosaphat.\r\nAnd the doom shall be on Easter Day, such time as our Lord arose.  And\r\nthe doom shall begin, such hour as our Lord descended to hell and\r\ndespoiled it.  For at such hour shall he despoil the world and lead his\r\nchosen to bliss; and the other shall he condemn to perpetual pains.  And\r\nthen shall every man have after his desert, either good or evil, but if\r\nthe mercy of God pass his righteousness.\r\n\r\nAlso a mile from Mount Tabor is the Mount Hermon; and there was the city\r\nof Nain.  Before the gate of that city raised our Lord the widow’s son,\r\nthat had no more children.  Also three miles from Nazareth is the Castle\r\nSafra, of the which the sons of Zebedee and the sons of Alpheus were.\r\nAlso a seven mile from Nazareth is the Mount Cain, and under that is a\r\nwell; and beside that well Lamech, Noah’s father, slew Cain with an\r\narrow.  For this Cain went through briars and bushes as a wild beast; and\r\nhe had lived from the time of Adam his father unto the time of Noah, and\r\nso he lived nigh to 2000 year.  And this Lamech was all blind for eld.\r\n\r\nFrom Safra men go to the sea of Galilee and to the city of Tiberias, that\r\nsits upon the same sea.  And albeit that men clepe it a sea, yet is it\r\nneither sea ne arm of the sea.  For it is but a stank of fresh water that\r\nis in length one hundred furlongs, and of breadth forty furlongs, and\r\nhath within him great plenty of good fish, and runneth into flom Jordan.\r\nThe city is not full great, but it hath good baths within him.\r\n\r\nAnd there, as the flome Jordan parteth from the sea of Galilee, is a\r\ngreat bridge, where men pass from the Land of Promission to the land of\r\nKing Bashan and the land of Gennesaret, that be about the flom Jordan and\r\nthe beginning of the sea of Tiberias.  And from thence may men go to\r\nDamascus, in three days, by the kingdom of Traconitis, the which kingdom\r\nlasteth from Mount Hermon to the sea of Galilee, or to the sea of\r\nTiberias, or to the sea of Gennesaret; and all is one sea, and this the\r\ntank that I have told you, but it changeth thus the name for the names of\r\nthe cities that sit beside him.\r\n\r\nUpon that sea went our Lord dry feet; and there he took up Saint Peter,\r\nwhen he began to drench within the sea, and said to him, _Modice fidei_,\r\n_quare dubitasti_?  And after his resurrection our Lord appeared on that\r\nsea to his disciples and bade them fish, and filled all the net full of\r\ngreat fishes.  In that sea rowed our Lord often-time; and there he called\r\nto him Saint Peter, Saint Andrew, Saint James and Saint John, the sons of\r\nZebedee.\r\n\r\nIn that city of Tiberias is the table upon the which our Lord ate upon\r\nwith his disciples after his resurrection; and they knew him in breaking\r\nof bread, as the gospel saith: _Et cognoverunt eum in fractione panis_.\r\nAnd nigh that city of Tiberias is the hill, where our Lord fed 5000\r\npersons with five barley loaves and two fishes.\r\n\r\nIn that city a man cast a burning dart in wrath after our Lord.  And the\r\nhead smote into the earth and waxed green; and it growed to a great tree.\r\nAnd yet it groweth and the bark thereof is all like coals.\r\n\r\nAlso in the head of that sea of Galilee, toward the septentrion is a\r\nstrong castle and an high that hight Saphor.  And fast beside it is\r\nCapernaum.  Within the Land of Promission is not so strong a castle.  And\r\nthere is a good town beneath that is clept also Saphor.  In that castle\r\nSaint Anne our Lady’s mother was born.  And there beneath, was Centurio’s\r\nhouse.  That country is clept the Galilee of Folk that were taken to\r\ntribute of Zebulon and Napthali.\r\n\r\nAnd in again coming from that castle, a thirty mile, is the city of Dan,\r\nthat sometime was clept Belinas or Cesarea Philippi; that sits at the\r\nfoot of the Mount of Lebanon, where the flome Jordan beginneth.  There\r\nbeginneth the Land of Promission and dureth unto Beersheba in length, in\r\ngoing toward the north into the south, and it containeth well a nine\r\nscore miles; and of breadth, that is to say, from Jericho unto Jaffa, and\r\nthat containeth a forty mile of Lombardy, or of our country, that be also\r\nlittle miles; these be not miles of Gascony ne of the province of\r\nAlmayne, where be great miles.  And wit ye well, that the Land of\r\nPromission is in Syria.  For the realm of Syria dureth from the deserts\r\nof Arabia unto Cilicia, and that is Armenia the great; that is to say,\r\nfrom the south to the north.  And, from the east to the west, it dureth\r\nfrom the great deserts of Arabia unto the West Sea.  But in that realm of\r\nSyria is the kingdom of Judea and many other provinces, as Palestine,\r\nGalilee, Little Cilicia, and many other.\r\n\r\nIn that country and other countries beyond they have a custom, when they\r\nshall use war, and when men hold siege about city or castle, and they\r\nwithin dare not send out messengers with letters from lord to lord for to\r\nask succour, they make their letters and bind them to the neck of a\r\nculver, and let the culver flee.  And the culvers be so taught, that they\r\nflee with those letters to the very place that men would send them to.\r\nFor the culvers be nourished in those places where they be sent to, and\r\nthey send them thus, for to bear their letters.  And the culvers return\r\nagain whereas they be nourished; and so they do commonly.\r\n\r\nAnd ye shall understand that amongst the Saracens, one part and other,\r\ndwell many Christian men of many manners and diverse names.  And all be\r\nbaptized and have diverse laws and diverse customs.  But all believe in\r\nGod the Father and the Son and the Holy Ghost; but always fail they in\r\nsome articles of our faith.  Some of these be clept Jacobites, for Saint\r\nJames converted them and Saint John baptized them.  They say that a man\r\nshall make his confession only to God, and not to a man; for only to him\r\nshould man yield him guilty of all that he hath misdone.  Ne God ordained\r\nnot, ne never devised, ne the prophet neither, that a man should shrive\r\nhim to another (as they say), but only to God.  As Moses writeth in the\r\nBible, and as David saith in the Psalter Book; _Confitebor tibi_,\r\n_Domine_, _in toto corde meo_, and _Delictum meum tibi cognitum feci_,\r\nand _Deus meus es tu_, _& confitebor tibi_, and _Quoniam cogitatio\r\nhominis confitebitur tibi_, etc.  For they know all the Bible and the\r\nPsalter.  And therefore allege they so the letter.  But they allege not\r\nthe authorities thus in Latin, but in their language full apertly, and\r\nsay well, that David and other prophets say it.\r\n\r\nNatheles, Saint Augustine and Saint Gregory say thus:—Augustinus: _Qui\r\nscelera sua cogitat_, _& conversus fuerit_, _veniam sibi credat_.\r\nGregorius: _Dominus potius mentem quam verba respicit_.  And Saint Hilary\r\nsaith: _Longorum temporum crimina_, _in ictu oculi pereunt_, _si cordis\r\nnata fuerit compunctio_.  And for such authorities they say, that only to\r\nGod shall a man knowledge his defaults, yielding himself guilty and\r\ncrying him mercy, and behoting to him to amend himself.  And therefore,\r\nwhen they will shrive them, they take fire and set it beside them, and\r\ncast therein powder of frankincense; and in the smoke thereof they shrive\r\nthem to God, and cry him mercy.  But sooth it is, that this confession\r\nwas first and kindly.  But Saint Peter the apostle, and they that came\r\nafter him, have ordained to make their confession to man, and by good\r\nreason; for they perceived well that no sickness was curable, [ne] good\r\nmedicine to lay thereto, but if men knew the nature of the malady; and\r\nalso no man may give convenable medicine, but if he know the quality of\r\nthe deed.  For one sin may be greater in one man than in another, and in\r\none place and in one time than in another; and therefore it behoveth him\r\nthat he know the kind of the deed, and thereupon to give him penance.\r\n\r\nThere be other, that be clept Syrians; and they hold the belief amongst\r\nus, and of them of Greece.  And they use all beards, as men of Greece do.\r\nAnd they make the sacrament of therf bread.  And in their language they\r\nuse letters of Saracens.  But after the mystery of Holy Church they use\r\nletters of Greece.  And they make their confession, right as the\r\nJacobites do.\r\n\r\nThere be other, that men clepe Georgians, that Saint George converted;\r\nand him they worship more than any other saint, and to him they cry for\r\nhelp.  And they came out of the realm of Georgia.  These folk use crowns\r\nshaven.  The clerks have round crowns, and the lewd men have crowns all\r\nsquare.  And they hold Christian law, as do they of Greece; of whom I\r\nhave spoken of before.\r\n\r\nOther there be that men clepe Christian men of Girding, for they be all\r\ngirt above.  And there be other that men clept Nestorians.  And some\r\nArians, some Nubians, some of Greece, some of Ind, and some of Prester\r\nJohn’s Land.  And all these have many articles of our faith, and to other\r\nthey be variant.  And of their variance were too long to tell, and so I\r\nwill leave, as for the time, without more speaking of them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV\r\n\r\n\r\n_Of the City of Damascus_.  _Of three ways to Jerusalem_; _one_, _by land\r\nand by sea_; _another_, _more by land than by sea_; _and the third way to\r\nJerusalem_, _all by land_\r\n\r\nNOW after that I have told you some part of folk in the countries before,\r\nnow will I turn again to my way, for to turn again on this half.  Then\r\nwhoso will go from the land of Galilee, of that that I have spoke for, to\r\ncome again on this half, men come again by Damascus, that is a full fair\r\ncity and full noble, and full of all merchandises, and a three journeys\r\nlong from the sea, and a five journeys from Jerusalem.  But upon camels,\r\nmules, horses, dromedaries and other beasts, men carry their merchandise\r\nthither.  And thither come the merchants with merchandise by sea from\r\nIndia, Persia, Chaldea, Armenia, and of many other kingdoms.\r\n\r\nThis city founded Eliezer Damascus, that was yeoman and dispenser of\r\nAbraham before that Isaac was born.  For he thought for to have been\r\nAbraham’s heir, and he named the town after his surname Damascus.  And in\r\nthat place, where Damascus was founded, Cain slew Abel his brother.  And\r\nbeside Damascus is the Mount Seir.  In that city of Damascus there is\r\ngreat plenty of wells.  And within the city and without be many fair\r\ngardens and of diverse fruits.  None other city is not like in comparison\r\nto it of fair gardens, and of fair disports.  The city is great and full\r\nof people, and well walled with double walls.  And there be many\r\nphysicians.  And Saint Paul himself was there a physician for to keep\r\nmen’s bodies in health, before he was converted.  And after that he was\r\nphysician of souls.  And Saint Luke the evangelist was disciple of Saint\r\nPaul for to learn physic, and many other; for Saint Paul held then school\r\nof physic.  And near beside Damascus was he converted.  And after his\r\nconversion ne dwelt in that city three days, without sight and without\r\nmeat or drink; and in those three days he was ravished to heaven, and\r\nthere he saw many privities of our Lord.\r\n\r\nAnd fast beside Damascus is the castle of Arkes that is both fair and\r\nstrong.\r\n\r\nFrom Damascus men come again by our Lady of Sardenak, that is a five mile\r\non this half Damascus.  And it sitteth upon a rock, and it is a full fair\r\nplace; and it seemeth a castle, for there was wont to be a castle, but it\r\nis now a full fair church.  And there within be monks and nuns Christian.\r\nAnd there is a vault under the church, where that Christian men dwell\r\nalso.  And they have many good vines.  And in the church, behind the high\r\naltar, in the wall, is a table of black wood, on the which sometime was\r\ndepainted an image of our Lady that turneth into flesh: but now the image\r\nsheweth but little, but alway, by the grace of God, that table evermore\r\ndrops oil, as it were of olive; and there is a vessel of marble under the\r\ntable to receive the oil.  Thereof they give to pilgrims, for it heals of\r\nmany sicknesses; and men say that, if it be kept well seven year,\r\nafterwards it turns into flesh and blood.  From Sardenak men come through\r\nthe vale of Bochar, the which is a fair vale and a plenteous of all\r\nmanner of fruit; and it is amongst hills.  And there are therein fair\r\nrivers and great meadows and noble pasture for beasts.  And men go by the\r\nmounts of Libanus, which lasts from Armenia the more towards the north\r\nunto Dan, the which is the end of the Land of Repromission toward the\r\nnorth, as I said before.  Their hills are right fruitful, and there are\r\nmany fair wells and cedars and cypresses, and many other trees of divers\r\nkinds.  There are also many good towns toward the head of their hills,\r\nfull of folk.\r\n\r\nBetween the city of Arkez and the city of Raphane is a river, that is\r\ncalled Sabatory; for on the Saturday it runs fast, and all the week else\r\nit stand still and runs not, or else but fairly.  Between the foresaid\r\nhills also is another water that on nights freezes hard and on days is no\r\nfrost seen thereon.  And, as men come again from those hills, is a hill\r\nhigher than any of the other, and they call it there the High Hill.\r\nThere is a great city and a fair, the which is called Tripoli, in the\r\nwhich are many good Christian men, yemand the same rites and customs that\r\nwe use.  From thence men come by a city that is called Beyrout, where\r\nSaint George slew the dragon; and it is a good town, and a fair castle\r\ntherein, and it is three journeys from the foresaid city of Sardenak.  At\r\nthe one side of Beyrout sixteen mile, to come hitherward, is the city of\r\nSydon.  At Beyrout enters pilgrims into the sea that will come to Cyprus,\r\nand they arrive at the port of Surry or of Tyre, and so they come to\r\nCyprus in a little space.  Or men may come from the port of Tyre and come\r\nnot at Cyprus, and arrive at some haven of Greece, and so come to these\r\nparts, as I said before.\r\n\r\nI have told you now of the way by which men go farrest and longest to\r\nJerusalem, as by Babylon and Mount Sinai and many other places which ye\r\nheard me tell of; and also by which ways men shall turn again to the Land\r\nof Repromission.  Now will I tell you the rightest way and the shortest\r\nto Jerusalem.  For some men will not go the other; some for they have not\r\nspending enough, some for they have no good company, and some for they\r\nmay not endure the long travel, some for they dread them of many perils\r\nof deserts, some for they will haste them homeward, desiring to see their\r\nwives and their children, or for some other reasonable cause that they\r\nhave to turn soon home.  And therefore I will shew how men may pass\r\ntittest and in shortest time make their pilgrimage to Jerusalem.  A man\r\nthat comes from the lands of the west, he goes through France, Burgoyne,\r\nand Lumbardy.  And so to Venice or Genoa, or some other haven, and ships\r\nthere and wends by sea to the isle of Greff, the which pertains to the\r\nGenoans.\r\n\r\nAnd syne he arrives in Greece at Port Mirrok, or at Valoun, or at Duras,\r\nor at some other haven of that country, and rests him there and buys him\r\nvictuals and ships again and sails to Cyprus and arrives there at\r\nFamagost and comes not at the isle of Rhodes.  Famagost is the chief\r\nhaven of Cyprus; and there he refreshes him and purveys him of victuals,\r\nand then he goes to ship and comes no more on land, if he will, before he\r\ncomes at Port Jaffa, that is the next haven to Jerusalem, for it is but a\r\nday journey and a half from Jerusalem, that is to say thirty-six mile.\r\nFrom the Port Jaffa men go to the city of Rames, the which is but a\r\nlittle thence; and it is a fair city and a good and mickle folk therein.\r\nAnd without that city toward the south is a kirk of our Lady, where our\r\nLord shewed him to her in three clouds, the which betokened the Trinity.\r\nAnd a little thence is another city, that men call Dispolis, but it hight\r\nsome time Lidda, a fair city and a well inhabited: there is a kirk of\r\nSaint George, where he was headed.  From thence men go to the castle of\r\nEmmaus, and so to the Mount Joy; there may pilgrims first see Jerusalem.\r\nAt Mount Joy lies Samuel the prophet.  From thence men go to Jerusalem.\r\nBeside their ways is the city of Ramatha and the Mount Modyn; and thereof\r\nwas Matathias, Judas Machabeus father, and there are the graves of the\r\nMachabees.  Beyond Ramatha is the town of Tekoa, whereof Amos the prophet\r\nwas; and there is his grave.\r\n\r\nI have told you before of the holy places that are at Jerusalem and about\r\nit, and therefore I will speak no more of them at this time.  But I will\r\nturn again and shew you other ways a man may pass more by land, and\r\nnamely for them that may not suffer the savour of the sea, but is liefer\r\nto go by land, if all it be the more pain.  From a man be entered into\r\nthe sea he shall pass till one of the havens of Lumbardy, for there is\r\nthe best making of purveyance of victuals; or he may pass to Genoa or\r\nVenice or some other.  And he shall pass by sea in to Greece to the Port\r\nMirrok, or to Valoun or to Duras, or some other haven of that country.\r\nAnd from thence he shall go by land to Constantinople, and he shall pass\r\nthe water that is called Brace Saint George, the which is one arm of the\r\nsea.  And from thence he shall by land go to Ruffynell, where a good\r\ncastle is and a strong; and from therein he shall go to Puluual, and syne\r\nto the castle of Sinope, and from thence to Cappadocia, that is a great\r\ncountry, where are many great hills.  And he shall go though Turkey to\r\nthe port of Chiutok and to the city of Nicæa, which is but seven miles\r\nthence.  That city won the Turks from the Emperor of Constantinople; and\r\nit is a fair city and well walled on the one side, and on the other side\r\nis a great lake and a great river, the which is called Lay.  From thence\r\nmen go by the hills of Nairmount and by the vales of Mailbrins and strait\r\nfells and by the town of Ormanx or by the towns that are on Riclay and\r\nStancon, the which are great rivers and noble, and so to Antioch the\r\nless, which is set on the river of Riclay.  And there abouts are many\r\ngood hills and fair, and many fair woods and great plenty of wild beasts\r\nfor to hunt at.\r\n\r\nAnd he that will go another way, he shall go by the plains of Romany\r\ncoasting the Roman Sea.  On that coast is a fair castle that men call\r\nFlorach, and it is right a strong place.  And uppermore amongst the\r\nmountains is a fair city, that is called Tarsus, and the city of\r\nLongemaath, and the city of Assere, and the city of Marmistre.  And when\r\na man is passed those mountains and those fells, he goes by the city of\r\nMarioch and by Artoise, where is a great bridge upon the river of Ferne,\r\nthat is called Farfar, and it is a great river bearing ships and it runs\r\nright fast out of the mountains to the city of Damascus.  And beside the\r\ncity of Damascus is another great river that comes from the hills of\r\nLiban, which men call Abbana.  At the passing of this river Saint\r\nEustace, that some-time was called Placidas, lost his wife and his two\r\nchildren.  This river runs through the plain of Archades, and so to the\r\nRed Sea.  From thence men go to the city of Phenice, where are hot wells\r\nand hot baths.  And then men go to the city of Ferne; and between Phenice\r\nand Ferne are ten mile.  And there are many fair woods.  And then men\r\ncome to Antioch, which is ten mile thence.  And it is a fair city and\r\nwell walled about with many fair towers; and it is a great city, but it\r\nwas some-time greater than it is now.  For it was some-time two mile on\r\nlength and on breadth other half mile.  And through the midst of that\r\ncity ran the water of Farphar and a great bridge over it; and there was\r\nsome-time in the walls about this city three hundred and fifty towers,\r\nand at each pillar of the bridge was a stone.  This is the chief city of\r\nthe kingdom of Syria.  And ten mile from this city is the port of Saint\r\nSymeon; and there goes the water of Farphar into the sea.  From Antioch\r\nmen go to a city that is called Lacuth, and then to Gebel, and then to\r\nTortouse.  And there near is the land of Channel; and there is a strong\r\ncastle that is called Maubek.  From Tortouse pass men to Tripoli by sea,\r\nor else by land through the straits of mountains and fells.  And there is\r\na city that is called Gibilet.  From Tripoli go men to Acres; and from\r\nthence are two ways to Jerusalem, the one on the left half and the other\r\non the right half.  By the left way men go by Damascus and by the flum\r\nJordan.  By the right way men go by Maryn and by the land of Flagramy and\r\nnear the mountains into the city of Cayphas, that some men call the\r\ncastle of Pilgrims.  And from thence to Jerusalem are three day journey,\r\nin the which men shall go through Caesarea Philippi, and so to Jaffa and\r\nRames and the castle of Emmaus, and so to Jerusalem.\r\n\r\nNow have I told you some ways by land and by water that men may go by to\r\nthe Holy Land after the countries that they come from.  Nevertheless they\r\ncome all to one end.  Yet is there another way to Jerusalem all by land,\r\nand pass not the sea, from France or Flanders; but that way is full long\r\nand perilous and of great travel, and therefore few go that way.  He that\r\nshall go that way, he shall go through Almayne and Prussia and so to\r\nTartary.  This Tartary is holden of the great Caan of Cathay, of whom I\r\nthink to speak afterward.  This is a full ill land and sandy and little\r\nfruit bearing.  For there grows no corn, ne wine, ne beans, ne peas, ne\r\nnone other fruit convenable to man for to live with.  But there are\r\nbeasts in great plenty: and therefore they eat but flesh without bread\r\nand sup the broth and they drink milk of all manner of beasts.  They eat\r\nhounds, cats, ratons, and all other wild beasts.  And they have no wood,\r\nor else little; and therefore they warm and seethe their meat with\r\nhorse-dung and cow-dung and of other beasts, dried against the sun.  And\r\nprinces and other eat not but once in the day, and that but little.  And\r\nthey be right foul folk and of evil kind.  And in summer, by all the\r\ncountries, fall many tempests and many hideous thunders and leits and\r\nslay much people and beasts also full often-time.  And suddenly is there\r\npassing heat, and suddenly also passing cold; and it is the foulest\r\ncountry and the most cursed and the poorest that men know.  And their\r\nprince, that governeth that country, that they clepe Batho, dwelleth at\r\nthe city of Orda.  And truly no good man should not dwell in that\r\ncountry, for the land and the country is not worthy hounds to dwell in.\r\nIt were a good country to sow in thistle and briars and broom and thorns\r\nand briars; and for no other thing is it not good.  Natheles, there is\r\ngood land in some place, but it is pure little, as men say.\r\n\r\nI have not been in that country, nor by those ways.  But I have been at\r\nother lands that march to those countries, as in the land of Russia, as\r\nin the land of Nyflan, and in the realm of Cracow and of Letto, and in\r\nthe realm of Daristan, and in many other places that march to the coasts.\r\nBut I went never by that way to Jerusalem, wherefore I may not well tell\r\nyou the manner.\r\n\r\nBut, if this matter please to any worthy man that hath gone by that way,\r\nhe may tell it if him like, to that intent, that those, that will go by\r\nthat way and make their voyage by those coasts, may know what way is\r\nthere.  For no man may pass by that way goodly, but in time of winter,\r\nfor the perilous waters and wicked mareys, that be in those countries,\r\nthat no man may pass but if it be strong frost and snow above.  For if\r\nthe snow ne were not, men might not go upon the ice, ne horse ne car\r\nneither.\r\n\r\nAnd it is well a three journeys of such way to pass from Prussia to the\r\nland of Saracens habitable.  And it behoveth to the Christian men, that\r\nshall war against them every year, to bear their victuals with them; for\r\nthey shall find there no good.  And then must they let carry their\r\nvictual upon the ice with cars that have no wheels, that they clepe\r\nsleighs.  And as long as their victuals last they may abide there, but no\r\nlonger; for there shall they find no wight that will sell them any\r\nvictual or anything.  And when the spies see any Christian men come upon\r\nthem, they run to the towns, and cry with a loud voice; _Kerra_, _Kerra_,\r\n_Kerra_.  And then anon they arm them and assemble them together.\r\n\r\nAnd ye shall understand that it freezeth more strongly in those countries\r\nthan on this half.  And therefore hath every man stews in his house, and\r\nin those stews they eat and do their occupations all that they may.  For\r\nthat is at the north parts that men clepe the Septentrional where it is\r\nall only cold.  For the sun is but little or none toward those countries.\r\nAnd therefore in the Septentrion, that is very north, is the land so\r\ncold, that no man may dwell there.  And, in the contrary, toward the\r\nsouth it is so hot, that no man ne may dwell there, because that the sun,\r\nwhen he is upon the south, casteth his beams all straight upon that part.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV\r\n\r\n\r\n_Of the Customs of Saracens_, _and of their Law_.  _And how the Soldan\r\nreasoned me_, _Author of this Book_; _and of the beginning of Mohammet_\r\n\r\nNOW, because that I have spoken of Saracens and of their country—now, if\r\nye will know a part of their law and of their belief, I shall tell you\r\nafter that their book that is clept _Alkaron_ telleth.  And some men\r\nclepe that book _Meshaf_.  And some men clepe it _Harme_, after the\r\ndiverse languages of the country.  The which book Mohammet took them.  In\r\nthe which book, among other things, is written, as I have often-time seen\r\nand read, that the good shall go to paradise, and the evil to hell; and\r\nthat believe all Saracens.  And if a man ask them what paradise they\r\nmean, they say, to paradise that is a place of delights where men shall\r\nfind all manner of fruits in all seasons, and rivers running of milk and\r\nhoney, and of wine and of sweet water; and that they shall have fair\r\nhouses and noble, every man after his desert, made of precious stones and\r\nof gold and of silver; and that every man shall have four score wives all\r\nmaidens, and he shall have ado every day with them, and yet he shall find\r\nthem always maidens.\r\n\r\nAlso they believe and speak gladly of the Virgin Mary and of the\r\nIncarnation.  And they say that Mary was taught of the angel; and that\r\nGabriel said to her, that she was for-chosen from the beginning of the\r\nworld and that he shewed to her the Incarnation of Jesu Christ and that\r\nshe conceived and bare child maiden; and that witnesseth their book.\r\n\r\nAnd they say also, that Jesu Christ spake as soon as he was born; and\r\nthat he was an holy prophet and a true in word and deed, and meek and\r\npiteous and rightful and without any vice.\r\n\r\nAnd they say also, that when the angel shewed the Incarnation of Christ\r\nunto Mary, she was young and had great dread.  For there was then an\r\nenchanter in the country that dealt with witchcraft, that men clept\r\nTaknia, that by his enchantments could make him in likeness of an angel,\r\nand went often-times and lay with maidens.  And therefore Mary dreaded\r\nlest it had been Taknia, that came for to deceive the maidens.  And\r\ntherefore she conjured the angel, that he should tell her if it were he\r\nor no.  And the angel answered and said that she should have no dread of\r\nhim, for he was very messenger of Jesu Christ.  Also their book saith,\r\nthat when that she had childed under a palm tree she had great shame,\r\nthat she had a child; and she greet and said that she would that she had\r\nbeen dead.  And anon the child spake to her and comforted her, and said,\r\n“Mother, ne dismay thee nought, for God hath hid in thee his privities\r\nfor the salvation of the world.”  And in other many places saith their\r\n_Alkaron_, that Jesu Christ spake as soon as he was born.  And that book\r\nsaith also that Jesu was sent from God Almighty for to be mirror and\r\nexample and token to all men.\r\n\r\nAnd the _Alkaron_ saith also of the day of doom how God shall come to\r\ndoom all manner of folk.  And the good he shall draw on his side and put\r\nthem into bliss, and the wicked he shall condemn to the pains of hell.\r\nAnd among all prophets Jesu was the most excellent and the most worthy\r\nnext God, and that he made the gospels in the which is good doctrine and\r\nhealthful, full of clarity and soothfastness and true preaching to them\r\nthat believe in God.  And that he was a very prophet and more than a\r\nprophet, and lived without sin, and gave sight to the blind, and healed\r\nthe lepers, and raised dead men, and styed to heaven.\r\n\r\nAnd when they may hold the Book of the Gospels of our Lord written and\r\nnamely _Missus est Angelus Gabriel_, that gospel they say, those that be\r\nlettered, often-times in their orisons, and they kiss it and worship it\r\nwith great devotion.\r\n\r\nThey fast an whole month in the year and eat nought but by night.  And\r\nthey keep them from their wives all that month.  But the sick men be not\r\nconstrained to that fast.\r\n\r\nAlso this book speaketh of Jews and saith that they be cursed; for they\r\nwould not believe that Jesu Christ was come of God.  And that they lied\r\nfalsely on Mary and on her son Jesu Christ, saying that they had\r\ncrucified Jesu the son of Mary; for he was never crucified, as they say,\r\nbut that God made him to sty up to him without death and without annoy.\r\nBut he transfigured his likeness into Judas Iscariot, and him crucified\r\nthe Jews, and weened that it had been Jesus.  But Jesus styed to heavens\r\nall quick.  And therefore they say, that the Christian men err and have\r\nno good knowledge of this, and that they believe folily and falsely that\r\nJesu Christ was crucified.  And they say yet, that and he had been\r\ncrucified, that God had done against his righteousness for to suffer Jesu\r\nChrist, that was innocent, to be put upon the cross without guilt.  And\r\nin this article they say that we fail and that the great righteousness of\r\nGod might not suffer so great a wrong: and in this faileth their faith.\r\nFor they knowledge well, that the works of Jesu Christ be good, and his\r\nwords and his deeds and his doctrine by his gospels were true, and his\r\nmiracles also true; and the blessed Virgin Mary is good, and holy maiden\r\nbefore and after the birth of Jesu Christ; and that all those that\r\nbelieve perfectly in God shall be saved.  And because that they go so\r\nnigh our faith, they be lightly converted to Christian law when men\r\npreach them and shew them distinctly the law of Jesu Christ, and when\r\nthey tell them of the prophecies.\r\n\r\nAnd also they say, that they know well by the prophecies that the law of\r\nMahomet shall fail, as the law of the Jews did; and that the law of\r\nChristian people shall last to the day of doom.  And if any man ask them\r\nwhat is their belief, they answer thus, and in this form: “We believe\r\nGod, former of heaven and of earth, and of all other things that he made.\r\nAnd without him is nothing made.  And we believe of the day of doom, and\r\nthat every man shall have his merit, after he hath deserved.  And, we\r\nbelieve it for sooth, all that God hath said by the mouths of his\r\nprophets.”\r\n\r\nAlso Mahomet commanded in his _Alkaron_, that every man should have two\r\nwives, or three or four; but now they take unto nine, and of lemans as\r\nmany as he may sustain.  And if any of their wives mis-bear them against\r\ntheir husband, he may cast her out of his house, and depart from her and\r\ntake another; but he shall depart with her his goods.\r\n\r\nAlso, when men speak to them of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy\r\nGhost, they say, that they be three persons, but not one God; for their\r\n_Alkaron_ speaketh not of the Trinity.  But they say well, that God hath\r\nspeech, and else were he dumb.  And God hath also a spirit they know\r\nwell, for else they say, he were not alive.  And when men speak to them\r\nof the Incarnation how that by the word of the angel God sent his wisdom\r\nin to earth and enombred him in the Virgin Mary, and by the word of God\r\nshall the dead be raised at the day of doom, they say, that it is sooth\r\nand that the word of God hath great strength.  And they say that whoso\r\nknew not the word of God he should not know God.  And they say also that\r\nJesu Christ is the word of God: and so saith their _Alkaron_, where it\r\nsaith that the angel spake to Mary and said: “Mary, God shall preach thee\r\nthe gospel by the word of his mouth and his name shall be clept Jesu\r\nChrist.”\r\n\r\nAnd they say also, that Abraham was friend to God, and that Moses was\r\nfamiliar speaker with God, and Jesu Christ was the word and the spirit of\r\nGod, and that Mohammet was right messenger of God.  And they say, that of\r\nthese four, Jesu was the most worthy and the most excellent and the most\r\ngreat.  So that they have many good articles of our faith, albeit that\r\nthey have no perfect law and faith as Christian men have; and therefore\r\nbe they lightly converted, and namely those that understand the\r\nscriptures and the prophecies.  For they have the gospels and the\r\nprophecies and the Bible written in their language; wherefore they ken\r\nmuch of holy writ, but they understand it not but after the letter.  And\r\nso do the Jews, for they understand not the letter ghostly, but bodily;\r\nand therefore be they reproved of the wise, that ghostly understand it.\r\nAnd therefore saith Saint Paul: _Litera occidit_; _spiritus autem\r\nvivificat_.  Also the Saracens say, that the Jews be cursed; for they\r\nhave befouled the law that God sent them by Moses: and the Christian be\r\ncursed also, as they say; for they keep not the commandments and the\r\nprecepts of the gospel that Jesu Christ taught them.\r\n\r\nAnd, therefore, I shall tell you what the soldan told me upon a day in\r\nhis chamber.  He let void out of his chamber all manner of men, lords and\r\nothers, for he would speak with me in counsel.  And there he asked me how\r\nthe Christian men governed them in our country.  And I said him, “Right\r\nwell, thanked be God!”\r\n\r\nAnd he said me, “Truly nay!  For ye Christian ne reck right nought, how\r\nuntruly to serve God!  Ye should give ensample to the lewd people for to\r\ndo well, and ye give them ensample to do evil.  For the commons, upon\r\nfestival days, when they should go to church to serve God, then go they\r\nto taverns, and be there in gluttony all the day and all night, and eat\r\nand drink as beasts that have no reason, and wit not when they have\r\nenough.  And also the Christian men enforce themselves in all manners\r\nthat they may, for to fight and for to deceive that one that other.  And\r\ntherewithal they be so proud, that they know not how to be clothed; now\r\nlong, now short, now strait, now large, now sworded, now daggered, and in\r\nall manner guises.  They should be simple, meek and true, and full of\r\nalms-deeds, as Jesu was, in whom they trow; but they be all the contrary,\r\nand ever inclined to the evil, and to do evil.  And they be so covetous,\r\nthat, for a little silver, they sell their daughters, their sisters and\r\ntheir own wives to put them to lechery.  And one withdraweth the wife of\r\nanother, and none of them holdeth faith to another; but they defoul their\r\nlaw that Jesu Christ betook them to keep for their salvation.  And thus,\r\nfor their sins, have they lost all this land that we hold.  For, for\r\ntheir sins, their God hath taken them into our hands, not only by\r\nstrength of ourself, but for their sins.  For we know well, in very\r\nsooth, that when ye serve God, God will help you; and when he is with\r\nyou, no man may be against you.  And that know we well by our prophecies,\r\nthat Christian men shall win again this land out of our hands, when they\r\nserve God more devoutly; but as long as they be of foul and of unclean\r\nliving (as they be now) we have no dread of them in no kind, for their\r\nGod will not help them in no wise.”\r\n\r\nAnd then I asked him, how he knew the state of Christian men.  And he\r\nanswered me, that he knew all the state of all courts of Christian kings\r\nand princes and the state of the commons also by his messengers that he\r\nsent to all lands, in manner as they were merchants of precious stones,\r\nof cloths of gold and of other things, for to know the manner of every\r\ncountry amongst Christian men.  And then he let clepe in all the lords\r\nthat he made void first out of his chamber, and there he shewed me four\r\nthat were great lords in the country, that told me of my country and of\r\nmany other Christian countries, as well as they had been of the same\r\ncountry; and they spake French right well, and the soldan also; whereof I\r\nhad great marvel.\r\n\r\nAlas! that it is great slander to our faith and to our law, when folk\r\nthat be without law shall reprove us and undernim us of our sins, and\r\nthey that should be converted to Christ and to the law of Jesu by our\r\ngood ensamples and by our acceptable life to God, and so converted to the\r\nlaw of Jesu Christ, be, through our wickedness and evil living, far from\r\nus and strangers from the holy and very belief, shall thus appeal us and\r\nhold us for wicked livers and cursed.  And truly they say sooth, for the\r\nSaracens be good and faithful; for they keep entirely the commandment of\r\nthe holy book _Alkaron_ that God sent them by his messenger Mahomet, to\r\nthe which, as they say, Saint Gabriel the angel oftentime told the will\r\nof God.\r\n\r\nAnd ye shall understand, that Mahomet was born in Arabia, that was first\r\na poor knave that kept camels, that went with merchants for merchandise.\r\nAnd so befell, that he went with the merchants into Egypt; and they were\r\nthen Christian in those parts.  And at the deserts of Arabia, he went\r\ninto a chapel where a hermit dwelt.  And when he entered into the chapel\r\nthat was but a little and a low thing and had but a little door and a\r\nlow, then the entry began to wax so great, and so large and so high as\r\nthough it had been of a great minster or the gate of a palace.  And this\r\nwas the first miracle, the Saracens say, that Mahomet did in his youth.\r\n\r\nAfter began he for to wax wise and rich.  And he was a great astronomer.\r\nAnd after, he was governor and prince of the land of Cozrodane; and he\r\ngoverned it full wisely, in such manner, that when the prince was dead,\r\nhe took the lady to wife that hight Gadrige.  And Mahomet fell often in\r\nthe great sickness that men call the falling evil; wherefore the lady was\r\nfull sorry that ever she took him to husband.  But Mahomet made her to\r\nbelieve, that all times, when he fell so, Gabriel the angel came for to\r\nspeak with him, and for the great light and brightness of the angel he\r\nmight not sustain him from falling; and therefore the Saracens say, that\r\nGabriel came often to speak with him.\r\n\r\nThis Mahomet reigned in Arabia, the year of our Lord Jesu Christ 610, and\r\nwas of the generation of Ishmael that was Abraham’s son, that he gat upon\r\nHagar his chamberer.  And therefore there be Saracens that be clept\r\nIshmaelites; and some Hagarenes, of Hagar.  And the other properly be\r\nclept Saracens, of Sarah.  And some be clept Moabites and some Ammonites,\r\nfor the two sons of Lot, Moab and Ammon, that he begat on his daughters\r\nthat were afterward great earthly princes.\r\n\r\nAnd also Mahomet loved well a good hermit that dwelled in the deserts a\r\nmile from Mount Sinai, in the way that men go from Arabia toward Chaldea\r\nand toward Ind, one day’s journey from the sea, where the merchants of\r\nVenice come often for merchandise.  And so often went Mahomet to this\r\nhermit, that all his men were wroth; for he would gladly hear this hermit\r\npreach and make his men wake all night.  And therefore his men thought to\r\nput the hermit to death.  And so it befell upon a night, that Mahomet was\r\ndrunken of good wine, and he fell on sleep.  And his men took Mahomet’s\r\nsword out of his sheath, whiles he slept, and therewith they slew this\r\nhermit, and put his sword all bloody in his sheath again.  And at morrow,\r\nwhen he found the hermit dead, he was full sorry and wroth, and would\r\nhave done his men to death.  But they all, with one accord, said that he\r\nhimself had slain him, when he was drunken, and shewed him his sword all\r\nbloody.  And he trowed that they had said sooth.  And then he cursed the\r\nwine and all those that drink it.  And therefore Saracens that be devout\r\ndrink never no wine.  But some drink it privily; for if they drunk it\r\nopenly, they should be reproved.  But they drink good beverage and sweet\r\nand nourishing that is made of gallamelle and that is that men make sugar\r\nof, that is of right good savour, and it is good for the breast.\r\n\r\nAlso it befalleth some-time, that Christian men become Saracens, either\r\nfor poverty or for simpleness, or else for their own wickedness.  And\r\ntherefore the archflamen or the flamen, as our archbishop or bishop, when\r\nhe receiveth them saith thus: _La ellec olla Sila_, _Machomete rores\r\nalla_; that is to say, ‘There is no God but one, and Mahomet his\r\nmessenger.’\r\n\r\nNow I have told you a part of their law and of their customs, I shall say\r\nyou of their letters that they have, with their names and the manner of\r\ntheir figures what they be: Almoy, Bethath, Cathi, Ephoti, Delphoi,\r\nFothi, Garothi, Hechum, Iotty, Kaythi, Lothum, Malach, Nabaloth, Orthi,\r\nChesiri, ȝoch, Ruth, Holath, Routhi, Salathi, Thatimus, Yrthom, Aȝaȝoth,\r\nArrocchi, ȝotipyn, Ichetus.  And these be the names of their a. b. c.\r\nNow shall ye know the figures. . . . And four letters they have more than\r\nother for diversity of their language and speech, forasmuch as they speak\r\nin their throats; and we in England have in our language and speech two\r\nletters more than they have in their a. b. c.; and that is Þ and ȝ, which\r\nbe clept thorn and ȝogh.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI\r\n\r\n\r\n_Of the lands of Albania and of Libia_.  _Of the wishings for watching of\r\n                 the Sparrow-hawk_; _and of Noah’s ship_\r\n\r\nNOW, sith I have told you before of the Holy Land and of that country\r\nabout, and of many ways for to go to that land and to the Mount Sinai,\r\nand of Babylon the more and the less, and to other places that I have\r\nspoken before, now is time, if it like you, for to tell you of the\r\nmarches and isles and diverse beasts, and of diverse folk beyond these\r\nmarches.\r\n\r\nFor in those countries beyond be many diverse countries and many great\r\nkingdoms, that be departed by the four floods that come from paradise\r\nterrestrial.  For Mesopotamia and the kingdom of Chaldea and Arabia be\r\nbetween the two rivers of Tigris and of Euphrates; and the kingdom of\r\nMedia and of Persia be between the rivers of Nile and of Tigris; and the\r\nkingdom of Syria, whereof I have spoken before, and Palestine and\r\nPhoenicia be between Euphrates and the sea Mediterranean, the which sea\r\ndureth in length from Morocco, upon the sea of Spain, unto the Great Sea,\r\nso that it lasteth beyond Constantinople 3040 miles of Lombardy.\r\n\r\nAnd toward the sea Ocean in Ind is the kingdom of Scythia, that is all\r\nclosed with hills.  And after, under Scythia, and from the sea of Caspian\r\nunto the flom of Thainy, is Amazonia, that is the land of feminye, where\r\nthat no man is, but only all women.  And after is Albania, a full great\r\nrealm; and it is clept Albania, because that the folk be whiter there\r\nthan in other marches there-about: and in that country be so great hounds\r\nand so strong, that they assail lions and slay them.  And then after is\r\nHircania, Bactria, Hiberia and many other kingdoms.\r\n\r\nAnd between the Red Sea and the sea Ocean, toward the south is the\r\nkingdom of Ethiopia and of Lybia the higher, the which land of Lybia\r\n(that is to say, Lybia the low) that beginneth at the sea of Spain from\r\nthence where the pillars of Hercules be, and endureth unto anent Egypt\r\nand toward Ethiopia.  In that country of Lybia is the sea more high than\r\nthe land, and it seemeth that it would cover the earth, and natheles yet\r\nit passeth not his marks.  And men see in that country a mountain to the\r\nwhich no man cometh.  In this land of Lybia whoso turneth toward the\r\neast, the shadow of himself is on the right side; and here, in our\r\ncountry, the shadow is on the left side.  In that sea of Lybia is no\r\nfish; for they may not live ne dure for the great heat of the sun,\r\nbecause that the water is evermore boiling for the great heat.  And many\r\nother lands there be that it were too long to tell or to number.  But of\r\nsome parts I shall speak more plainly hereafter.\r\n\r\nWhoso will then go toward Tartary, toward Persia, toward Chaldea and\r\ntoward Ind, he must enter the sea at Genoa or at Venice or at some other\r\nhaven that I have told you before.  And then pass men the sea and arrive\r\nat Trebizond that is a good city; and it was wont to be the haven of\r\nPontus.  There is the haven of Persians and of Medians and of the marches\r\nthere beyond.  In that city lieth Saint Athanasius that was bishop of\r\nAlexandria, that made the psalm _Quicunque vult_.\r\n\r\nThis Athanasius was a great doctor of divinity.  And, because that he\r\npreached and spake so deeply of divinity and of the Godhead, he was\r\naccused to the Pope of Rome that he was an heretic.  Wherefore the Pope\r\nsent after him and put him in prison.  And whiles he was in prison he\r\nmade that psalm and sent it to the Pope, and said, that if he were an\r\nheretic, then was that heresy, for that, he said, was his belief.  And\r\nwhen the Pope saw it, and had examined it that it was perfect and good,\r\nand verily our faith and our belief, he made him to be delivered out of\r\nprison, and commanded that psalm to be said every day at prime; and so he\r\nheld Athanasius a good man.  But he would never go to his bishopric\r\nagain, because that they accused him of heresy.\r\n\r\nTrebizond was wont to be holden of the Emperor of Constantinople; but a\r\ngreat man, that he sent for to keep the country against the Turks,\r\nusurped the land and held it to himself, and cleped him Emperor of\r\nTrebizond.\r\n\r\nAnd from thence men go through Little Armenia.  And in that country is an\r\nold castle that stands upon a rock; the which is clept the castle of the\r\nSparrow-hawk, that is beyond the city of Layays beside the town of\r\nPharsipee, that belongeth to the lordship of Cruk, that is a rich lord\r\nand a good Christian man; where men find a sparrow-hawk upon a perch\r\nright fair and right well made, and a fair lady of faerie that keepeth\r\nit.  And who that will watch that sparrow-hawk seven days and seven\r\nnights, and, as some men say, three days and three nights, without\r\ncompany and without sleep, that fair lady shall give him, when he hath\r\ndone, the first wish that he will wish of earthly things; and that hath\r\nbeen proved often-times.\r\n\r\nAnd one time befell, that a King of Armenia, that was a worthy knight and\r\ndoughty man, and a noble princes watched that hawk some time.  And at the\r\nend of seven days and seven nights the lady came to him and bade him\r\nwish, for he had well deserved it.  And he answered that he was great\r\nlord enough, and well in peace, and had enough of worldly riches; and\r\ntherefore he would wish none other thing, but the body of that fair lady,\r\nto have it at his will.  And she answered him, that he knew not what he\r\nasked, and said that he was a fool to desire that he might not have; for\r\nshe said that he should not ask but earthly thing, for she was none\r\nearthly thing, but a ghostly thing.  And the king said that he ne would\r\nask none other thing.  And the lady answered; “Sith that I may not\r\nwithdraw you from your lewd corage, I shall give you without wishing, and\r\nto all them that shall come of you.  Sir king! ye shall have war without\r\npeace, and always to the nine degree, ye shall be in subjection of your\r\nenemies, and ye shall be needy of all goods.”  And never since, neither\r\nthe King of Armenia nor the country were never in peace; ne they had\r\nnever sith plenty of goods; and they have been sithen always under\r\ntribute of the Saracens.\r\n\r\nAlso the son of a poor man watched that hawk and wished that he might\r\nchieve well, and to be happy to merchandise.  And the lady granted him.\r\nAnd he became the most rich and the most famous merchant that might be on\r\nsea or on earth.  And he became so rich that he knew not the thousand\r\npart of that he had.  And he was wiser in wishing than was the king.\r\n\r\nAlso a knight of the Temple watched there, and wished a purse evermore\r\nfull of gold.  And the lady granted him.  But she said him that he had\r\nasked the destruction of their order for the trust and the affiance of\r\nthat purse, and for the great pride that they should have.  And so it\r\nwas.  And therefore look he keep him well, that shall wake.  For if he\r\nsleep he is lost, that never man shall see him more.\r\n\r\nThis is not the right way for to go to the parts that I have named\r\nbefore, but for to see the marvel that I have spoken of.  And therefore\r\nwhoso will go right way, men go from Trebizond toward Armenia the Great\r\nunto a city that is clept Erzeroum, that was wont to be a good city and a\r\nplenteous; but the Turks have greatly wasted it.  There-about groweth no\r\nwine nor fruit, but little or else none.  In this land is the earth more\r\nhigh than in any other, and that maketh great cold.  And there be many\r\ngood waters and good wells that come under earth from the flom of\r\nParadise, that is clept Euphrates, that is a journey beside that city;\r\nand that river cometh towards Ind under earth, and resorteth into the\r\nland of Altazar.  And so pass men by this Armenia and enter the sea of\r\nPersia.\r\n\r\nFrom that city of Erzeroum go men to an hill that is clept Sabissocolle.\r\nAnd there beside is another hill that men clepe Ararat, but the Jews\r\nclepe it Taneez, where Noah’s ship rested, and yet is upon that mountain.\r\nAnd men may see it afar in clear weather.  And that mountain is well a\r\nseven mile high.  And some men say that they have seen and touched the\r\nship, and put their fingers in the parts where the fiend went out, when\r\nthat Noah said, _Benedicite_.  But they that say such words, say their\r\nwill.  For a man may not go up the mountain, for great plenty of snow\r\nthat is always on that mountain, neither summer nor winter.  So that no\r\nman may go up there, ne never man did, since the time of Noah, save a\r\nmonk that, by the grace of God, brought one of the planks down, that yet\r\nis in the minster at the foot of the mountain.\r\n\r\nAnd beside is the city of Dain that Noah founded.  And fast by is the\r\ncity of Any in the which were wont to be a thousand churches.\r\n\r\nBut upon that mountain to go up, this monk had great desire.  And so upon\r\na day, he went up.  And when he was upward the three part of the mountain\r\nhe was so weary that he might no further, and so he rested him, and fell\r\nasleep.  And when he awoke he found himself lying at the foot of the\r\nmountain.  And then he prayed devoutly to God that he would vouchsafe to\r\nsuffer him go up.  And an angel came to him, and said that he should go\r\nup.  And so he did.  And sith that time never none.  Wherefore men should\r\nnot believe such words.\r\n\r\nFrom that mountain go men to the city of Thauriso that was wont to be\r\nclept Taxis, that is a full fair city and a great, and one of the best\r\nthat is in the world for merchandise; thither come all merchants for to\r\nbuy avoirdupois, and it is in the land of the Emperor of Persia.  And men\r\nsay that the emperor taketh more good in that city for custom of\r\nmerchandise than doth the richest Christian king of all his realm that\r\nliveth.  For the toll and the custom of his merchants is without\r\nestimation to be numbered.  Beside that city is a hill of salt, and of\r\nthat salt every man taketh what he will for to salt with, to his need.\r\nThere dwell many Christian men under tribute of Saracens.  And from that\r\ncity, men pass by many towns and castles in going toward Ind unto the\r\ncity of Sadonia, that is a ten journeys from Thauriso, and it is a full\r\nnoble city and a great.  And there dwelleth the Emperor of Persia in\r\nsummer; for the country is cold enough.  And there be good rivers bearing\r\nships.\r\n\r\nAfter go men the way toward Ind by many journeys, and by many countries,\r\nunto the city that is clept Cassak, and that is a full noble city, and a\r\nplenteous of corns and wines and of all other goods.  This is the city\r\nwhere the three kings met together when they went to seek our Lord in\r\nBethlehem to worship him and to present him with gold, incense, and\r\nmyrrh.  And it is from that city to Bethlehem fifty-three journeys.  From\r\nthat city men go to another city that is clept Gethe, that is a journey\r\nfrom the sea that men clepe the Gravelly Sea.  That is the best city that\r\nthe Emperor of Persia hath in all his land.  And they clepe flesh there\r\nDabago and the wine Vapa.  And the Paynims say that no Christian man may\r\nnot long dwell ne endure with the life in that city, but die within short\r\ntime; and no man knoweth not the cause.\r\n\r\nAfter go men by many cities and towns and great countries that it were\r\ntoo long to tell unto the city of Cornaa that was wont to be so great\r\nthat the walls about hold twenty-five mile about.  The walls shew yet,\r\nbut it is not all inhabited.  From Cornaa go men by many lands and many\r\ncities and towns unto the land of Job.  And there endeth the land of the\r\nEmperor of Persia.  And if ye will know the letters of Persians and what\r\nnames they have, they be such as I last devised you, but not in sounding\r\nof their words.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII\r\n\r\n\r\n_Of the land of Job_; _and of his age_.  _Of the array of men of\r\nChaldea_.  _Of the land where women dwell without company of men_.  _Of\r\nthe knowledge and virtues of the very diamond_\r\n\r\nAFTER the departing from Cornaa, men enter into the land of Job that is a\r\nfull fair country and a plenteous of all goods.  And men clepe that land\r\nthe Land of Susiana.  In that land is the city of Theman.\r\n\r\nJob was a paynim, and he was Aram of Gosre, his son, and held that land\r\nas prince of that country.  And he was so rich that he knew not the\r\nhundred part of his goods.  And although he were a paynim, nevertheless\r\nhe served well God after his law.  And our Lord took his service to his\r\npleasane.  And when he fell in poverty he was seventy-eight year of age.\r\nAnd after, when God had proved his patience and that it was so great, he\r\nbrought him again to riches and to higher estate than he was before.  And\r\nafter that he was King of Idumea after King Esau, and when he was king he\r\nwas clept Jobab.  And in that kingdom he lived after 170 year.  And so he\r\nwas of age, when he died, 248 year.\r\n\r\nIn that land of Job there ne is no default of no thing that is needful to\r\nman’s body.  There be hills, where men get great plenty of manna in\r\ngreater abundance than in any other country.  This manna is clept bread\r\nof angels.  And it is a white thing that is full sweet and right\r\ndelicious, and more sweet than honey or sugar.  And it cometh of the dew\r\nof heaven that falleth upon the herbs in that country.  And it congealeth\r\nand becometh all white and sweet.  And men put it in medicines for rich\r\nmen to make the womb lax, and to purge evil blood.  For it cleanseth the\r\nblood and putteth out melancholy.  This land of Job marcheth to the\r\nkingdom of Chaldea.\r\n\r\nThis land of Chaldea is full great.  And the language of that country is\r\nmore great in sounding than it is in other parts of the sea.  Men pass to\r\ngo beyond by the Tower of Babylon the Great, of the which I have told you\r\nbefore, where that all the languages were first changed.  And that is a\r\nfour journeys from Chaldea.  In that realm be fair men, and they go full\r\nnobly arrayed in clothes of gold, orfrayed and apparelled with great\r\npearls and precious stone’s full nobly.  And the women be right foul and\r\nevil arrayed.  And they go all bare-foot and clothed in evil garments\r\nlarge and wide, but they be short to the knees, and long sleeves down to\r\nthe feet like a monk’s frock, and their sleeves be hanging about their\r\nshoulders.  And they be black women foul and hideous, and truly as foul\r\nas they be, as evil they be.\r\n\r\nIn that kingdom of Chaldea, in a city that is clept Ur, dwelled Terah,\r\nAbraham’s father.  And there was Abraham born.  And that was in that time\r\nthat Ninus was king of Babylon, of Arabia and of Egypt.  This Ninus made\r\nthe city of Nineveh, the which that Noah had begun before.  And because\r\nthat Ninus performed it, he cleped it Nineveh after his own name.  There\r\nlieth Tobit the prophet, of whom Holy Writ speaketh of.  And from that\r\ncity of Ur Abraham departed, by the commandment of God, from thence,\r\nafter the death of his father, and led with him Sarah his wife and Lot\r\nhis brother’s son, because that he had no child.  And they went to dwell\r\nin the land of Canaan in a place that is clept Shechem.  And this Lot was\r\nhe that was saved, when Sodom and Gomorrah and the other cities were\r\nburnt and sunken down to hell, where that the Dead Sea is now, as I have\r\ntold you before.  In that land of Chaldea they have their proper\r\nlanguages and their proper letters, such as ye may see hereafter.\r\n\r\nBeside the land of Chaldea is the land of Amazonia, that is the land of\r\nFeminye.  And in that realm is all women and no man; not, as some men\r\nsay, that men may not live there, but for because that the women will not\r\nsuffer no men amongst them to be their sovereigns.\r\n\r\nFor sometime there was a king in that country.  And men married, as in\r\nother countries.  And so befell that the king had war with them of\r\nScythia, the which king hight Colopeus, that was slain in battle, and all\r\nthe good blood of his realm.  And when the queen and all the other noble\r\nladies saw that they were all widows, and that all the royal blood was\r\nlost, they armed them and, as creatures out of wit, they slew all the men\r\nof the country that were left; for they would that all the women were\r\nwidows as the queen and they were.  And from that time hitherwards they\r\nnever would suffer man to dwell amongst them longer than seven days and\r\nseven nights; ne that no child that were male should dwell amongst them\r\nlonger than he were nourished; and then sent to his father.  And when\r\nthey will have any company of man then they draw them towards the lands\r\nmarching next to them.  And then they have loves that use them; and they\r\ndwell with them an eight days or ten, and then go home again.  And if\r\nthey have any knave child they keep it a certain time, and then send it\r\nto the father when he can go alone and eat by himself; or else they slay\r\nit.  And if it be a female they do away that one pap with an hot iron.\r\nAnd if it be a woman of great lineage they do away the left pap that they\r\nmay the better bear a shield.  And if it be a woman on foot they do away\r\nthe right pap, for to shoot with bow turkeys: for they shoot well with\r\nbows.\r\n\r\nIn that land they have a queen that governeth all that land, and all they\r\nbe obeissant to her.  And always they make her queen by election that is\r\nmost worthy in arms; for they be right good warriors and orped, and wise,\r\nnoble and worthy.  And they go oftentime in solde to help of other kings\r\nin their wars, for gold and silver as other soldiers do; and they\r\nmaintain themselves right vigourously.  This land of Amazonia is an isle,\r\nall environed with the sea save in two places, where be two entries.  And\r\nbeyond that water dwell the men that be their paramours and their loves,\r\nwhere they go to solace them when they will.\r\n\r\nBeside Amazonia is the land of Tarmegyte that is a great country and a\r\nfull delectable.  And for the goodness of the country King Alexander let\r\nfirst make there the city of Alexandria, and yet he made twelve cities of\r\nthe same name; but that city is now clept Celsite.\r\n\r\nAnd from that other coast of Chaldea, toward the south, is Ethiopia, a\r\ngreat country that stretcheth to the end of Egypt.  Ethiopia is departed\r\nin two parts principal, and that is in the east part and in the\r\nmeridional part; the which part meridional is clept Mauritania; and the\r\nfolk of that country be black enough and more black than in the tother\r\npart, and they be clept Moors.  In that part is a well, that in the day\r\nit is so cold, that no man may drink thereof; and in the night it is so\r\nhot, that no man may suffer his hand therein.  And beyond that part,\r\ntoward the south, to pass by the sea Ocean, is a great land and a great\r\ncountry; but men may not dwell there for the fervent burning of the sun,\r\nso is it passing hot in that country.\r\n\r\nIn Ethiopia all the rivers and all the waters be trouble, and they be\r\nsomedeal salt for the great heat that is there.  And the folk of that\r\ncountry be lightly drunken and have but little appetite to meat.  And\r\nthey have commonly the flux of the womb.  And they live not long.  In\r\nEthiopia be many diverse folk; and Ethiope is clept Cusis.  In that\r\ncountry be folk that have but one foot, and they go so blyve that it is\r\nmarvel.  And the foot is so large, that it shadoweth all the body against\r\nthe sun, when they will lie and rest them.  In Ethiopia, when the\r\nchildren be young and little, they be all yellow; and, when that they wax\r\nof age, that yellowness turneth to be all black.  In Ethiopia is the city\r\nof Saba, and the land of the which one of the three kings that presented\r\nour Lord in Bethlehem, was king of.\r\n\r\nFrom Ethiopia men go into Ind by many diverse countries.  And men clepe\r\nthe high Ind, Emlak.  And Ind is divided in three principal parts; that\r\nis, the more that is a full hot country; and Ind the less, that is a full\r\nattempre country, that stretcheth to the land of Media; and the three\r\npart toward the septentrion is full cold, so that, for pure cold and\r\ncontinual frost, the water becometh crystal.  And upon those rocks of\r\ncrystal grow the good diamonds that be of trouble colour.  Yellow crystal\r\ndraweth colour like oil.  And they be so hard, that no man may polish\r\nthem.  And men clepe them diamonds in that country, and _Hamese_ in\r\nanother country.  Other diamonds men find in Arabia that be not so good,\r\nand they be more brown and more tender.  And other diamonds also men find\r\nin the isle of Cyprus, that be yet more tender, and them men may well\r\npolish.  And in the land of Macedonia men find diamonds also.  But the\r\nbest and the most precious be in Ind.\r\n\r\nAnd men find many times hard diamonds in a mass that cometh out of gold,\r\nwhen men pure it and refine it out of the mine; when men break that mass\r\nin small pieces, and sometime it happens that men find some as great as a\r\npeas and some less, and they be as hard as those of Ind.\r\n\r\nAnd albeit that men find good diamonds in Ind, yet nevertheless men find\r\nthem more commonly upon the rocks in the sea and upon hills where the\r\nmine of gold is.  And they grow many together, one little, another great.\r\nAnd there be some of the greatness of a bean and some as great as an\r\nhazel nut.  And they be square and pointed of their own kind, both above\r\nand beneath, without working of man’s hand.  And they grow together, male\r\nand female.  And they be nourished with the dew of heaven.  And they\r\nengender commonly and bring forth small children, that multiply and grow\r\nall the year.  I have often-times assayed, that if a man keep them with a\r\nlittle of the rock and wet them with May-dew oft-sithes, they shall grow\r\nevery year, and the small will wax great.  For right as the fine pearl\r\ncongealeth and waxeth great of the dew of heaven, right so doth the very\r\ndiamond; and right as the pearl of his own kind taketh roundness, right\r\nso the diamond, by virtue of God, taketh squareness.  And men shall bear\r\nthe diamond on his left side, for it is of greater virtue then, than on\r\nthe right side; for the strength of their growing is toward the north,\r\nthat is the left side of the world, and the left part of man is when he\r\nturneth his face toward the east.\r\n\r\nAnd if you like to know the virtues of the diamond, (as men may find in\r\n_The Lapidary_ that many men know not), I shall tell you, as they beyond\r\nthe sea say and affirm, of whom all science and all philosophy cometh\r\nfrom.  He that beareth the diamond upon him, it giveth him hardiness and\r\nmanhood, and it keepeth the limbs of his body whole.  It giveth him\r\nvictory of his enemies in plea and in war, if his cause be rightful.  And\r\nit keepeth him that beareth it in good wit.  And it keepeth him from\r\nstrife and riot, from evil swevens from sorrows and from enchantments,\r\nand from fantasies and illusions of wicked spirits.  And if any cursed\r\nwitch or enchanter would bewitch him that beareth the diamond, all that\r\nsorrow and mischance shall turn to himself through virtue of that stone.\r\nAnd also no wild beast dare assail the man that beareth it on him.  Also\r\nthe diamond should be given freely, without coveting and without buying,\r\nand then it is of greater virtue.  And it maketh a man more strong and\r\nmore sad against his enemies.  And it healeth him that is lunatic, and\r\nthem that the fiend pursueth or travaileth.  And if venom or poison be\r\nbrought in presence of the diamond, anon it beginneth to wax moist and\r\nfor to sweat.\r\n\r\nThere be also diamonds in Ind that be clept violastres, (for their colour\r\nis like violet, or more brown than the violets), that be full hard and\r\nfull precious.  But yet some men love not them so well as the other; but,\r\nin sooth, to me, I would love them as much as the other, for I have seen\r\nthem assayed.\r\n\r\nAlso there is another manner of diamonds that be as white as crystal, but\r\nthey be a little more trouble.  And they be good and of great virtue, and\r\nall they be square and pointed of their own kind.  And some be six\r\nsquared, some four squared, and some three as nature shapeth them.  And\r\ntherefore when great lords and knights go to seek worship in arms, they\r\nbear gladly the diamond upon them.\r\n\r\nI shall speak a little more of the diamonds, although I tarry my matter\r\nfor a time, to the end, that they that know them not, be not deceived by\r\ngabbers that go by the country, that sell them.  For whoso will buy the\r\ndiamond it is needful to him that he know them.  Because that men\r\ncounterfeit them often of crystal that is yellow and of sapphires of\r\ncitron colour that is yellow also, and of the sapphire loupe and of many\r\nother stones.  But I tell you these counterfeits be not so hard; and also\r\nthe points will break lightly, and men may easily polish them.  But some\r\nworkmen, for malice, will not polish them; to that intent, to make men\r\nbelieve that they may not be polished.  But men may assay them in this\r\nmanner.  First shear with them or write with them in sapphires, in\r\ncrystal or in other precious stones.  After that, men take the adamant,\r\nthat is the shipman’s stone, that draweth the needle to him, and men lay\r\nthe diamond upon the adamant, and lay the needle before the adamant; and,\r\nif the diamond be good and virtuous, the adamant draweth not the needle\r\nto him whiles the diamond is there present.  And this is the proof that\r\nthey beyond the sea make.\r\n\r\nNatheles it befalleth often-time, that the good diamond loseth his virtue\r\nby sin, and for incontinence of him that beareth it.  And then it is\r\nneedful to make it to recover his virtue again, or else it is of little\r\nvalue.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII\r\n\r\n\r\n_Of the customs of Isles about Ind_.  _Of the difference betwixt Idols\r\nand Simulacres_.  _Of three manner growing of Pepper upon one tree_.  _Of\r\nthe Well that changeth his odour every hour of the day_; _and that is\r\nmarvel_\r\n\r\nIN Ind be full many diverse countries.  And it is clept Ind, for a flom\r\nthat runneth throughout the country that is clept Ind.  In that flom men\r\nfind eels of thirty foot long and more.  And the folk that dwell nigh\r\nthat water be of evil colour, green and yellow.\r\n\r\nIn Ind and about Ind be more than 5000 isles good and great that men\r\ndwell in, without those that he inhabitable, and without other small\r\nisles.  In every isle is great plenty of cities, and of towns, and of\r\nfolk without number.  For men of Ind have this condition of kind, that\r\nthey never go out of their own country, and therefore is there great\r\nmultitude of people.  But they be not stirring ne movable, because that\r\nthey be in the first climate, that is of Saturn; and Saturn is slow and\r\nlittle moving, for he tarryeth to make his turn by the twelve signs\r\nthirty year.  And the moon passeth through the twelve signs in one month.\r\nAnd for because that Saturn is of so late stirring, therefore the folk of\r\nthat country that be under his climate have of kind no will for to move\r\nne stir to seek strange places.  And in our country is all the contrary;\r\nfor we be in the seventh climate, that is of the moon.  And the moon is\r\nof lightly moving, and the moon is planet of way; and for that skill it\r\ngiveth us will of kind for to move lightly and for to go divers ways, and\r\nto seek strange things and other diversities of the world; for the moon\r\nenvironeth the earth more hastily than any other planet.\r\n\r\nAlso men go through Ind by many diverse countries to the great sea Ocean.\r\nAnd after, men find there an isle that is clept Crues.  And thither come\r\nmerchants of Venice and Genoa, and of other marches, for to buy\r\nmerchandises.  But there is so great heat in those marches, and namely in\r\nthat isle, that, for the great distress of the heat, men’s ballocks hang\r\ndown to their knees for the great dissolution of the body.  And men of\r\nthat country, that know the manner, let bind them up, or else might they\r\nnot live, and anoint them with ointments made therefore, to hold them up.\r\n\r\nIn that country and in Ethiopia, and in many other countries, the folk\r\nlie all naked in rivers and waters, men and women together, from undern\r\nof the day till it be past the noon.  And they lie all in the water, save\r\nthe visage, for the great heat that there is.  And the women have no\r\nshame of the men, but lie all together, side to side, till the heat be\r\npast.  There may men see many foul figure assembled, and namely nigh the\r\ngood towns.\r\n\r\nIn that isle be ships without nails of iron or bonds, for the rocks of\r\nthe adamants, for they be all full thereabout in that sea, that it is\r\nmarvel to speak of.  And if a ship passed by those marches that had\r\neither iron bonds or iron nails, anon he should be perished; for the\r\nadamant of his kind draweth the iron to him.  And so would it draw to him\r\nthe ship because of the iron, that he should never depart from it, ne\r\nnever go thence.\r\n\r\nFrom that isle men go by sea to another isle that is clept Chana, where\r\nis great plenty of corn and wine.  And it was wont to be a great isle,\r\nand a great haven and a good; but the sea hath greatly wasted it and\r\novercome it.  The king of that country was wont to be so strong and so\r\nmighty that he held war against King Alexander.\r\n\r\nThe folk of that country have a diverse law.  For some of them worship\r\nthe sun, some the moon, some the fire, some trees, some serpents, or the\r\nfirst thing that they meet at morrow.  And some worship simulacres and\r\nsome idols.  But between simulacres and idols is a great difference.  For\r\nsimulacres be images made after likeness of men or of women, or of the\r\nsun, or of the moon, or of any beast, or of any kindly thing.  And idols\r\nis an image made of lewd will of man, that man may not find among kindly\r\nthings, as an image that hath four heads, one of a man, another of an\r\nhorse or of an ox, or of some other beast, that no man hath seen after\r\nkindly disposition.\r\n\r\nAnd they that worship simulacres, they worship them for some worthy man\r\nthat was sometime, as Hercules, and many other that did many marvels in\r\ntheir time.  For they say well that they be not gods; for they know well\r\nthat there is a God of kind that made all things, the which is in heaven.\r\nBut they know well that this may not do the marvels that he made, but if\r\nit had been by the special gift of God; and therefore they say that he\r\nwas well with God, and for because that he was so well with God,\r\ntherefore they worship him.  And so say they of the sun, because that he\r\nchangeth the time, and giveth heat, and nourisheth all things upon earth;\r\nand for it is of so great profit, they know well that that might not be,\r\nbut that God loveth it more than any other thing, and, for that skill,\r\nGod hath given it more great virtue in the world.  Therefore, it is good\r\nreason, as they say, to do it worship and reverence.  And so say they,\r\nand make their reasons, of other planets, and of the fire also, because\r\nit is so profitable.\r\n\r\nAnd of idols they say also that the ox is the most holy beast that is in\r\nearth and most patient, and more profitable than any other.  For he doth\r\ngood enough and he doth no evil; and they know well that it may not be\r\nwithout special grace of God.  And therefore make they their god of an ox\r\nthe one part, and the other half of a man.  Because that man is the most\r\nnoble creature in earth, and also for he hath lordship above all beasts,\r\ntherefore make they the halvendel of idol of a man upwards; and the\r\ntother half of an ox downwards, and of serpents, and of other beasts and\r\ndiverse things, that they worship, that they meet first at morrow.\r\n\r\nAnd they worship also specially all those that they have good meeting of;\r\nand when they speed well in their journey, after their meeting, and\r\nnamely such as they have proved and assayed by experience of long time;\r\nfor they say that thilk good meeting ne may not come but of the grace of\r\nGod.  And therefore they make images like to those things that they have\r\nbelief in, for to behold them and worship them first at morning, or they\r\nmeet any contrarious things.  And there be also some Christian men that\r\nsay, that some beasts have good meeting, that is to say for to meet with\r\nthem first at morrow, and some beasts wicked meeting; and that they have\r\nproved oft-time that the hare hath full evil meeting, and swine and many\r\nother beasts.  And the sparrow-hawk or other fowls of ravine, when they\r\nfly after their prey and take it before men of arms, it is a good sign;\r\nand if he fail of taking his prey, it is an evil sign.  And also to such\r\nfolk, it is an evil meeting of ravens.\r\n\r\nIn these things and in such other, there be many folk that believe;\r\nbecause it happeneth so often-time to fall after their fantasies.  And\r\nalso there be men enough that have no belief in them.  And, sith that\r\nChristian men have such belief, that be informed and taught all day by\r\nholy doctrine, wherein they should believe, it is no marvel then, that\r\nthe paynims, that have no good doctrine but only of their nature, believe\r\nmore largely for their simplesse.  And truly I have seen of paynims and\r\nSaracens that men clepe Augurs, that, when we ride in arms in divers\r\ncountries upon our enemies, by the flying of fowls they would tell us the\r\nprognostications of things that fell after; and so they did full\r\noftentimes, and proffered their heads to-wedde, but if it would fall as\r\nthey said.  But natheles, therefore should not a man put his belief in\r\nsuch things, but always have full trust and belief in God our sovereign\r\nLord.\r\n\r\nThis isle of Chana the Saracens have won and hold.  In that isle be many\r\nlions and many other wild beasts.  And there be rats in that isle as\r\ngreat as hounds here; and men take them with great mastiffs, for cats may\r\nnot take them.  In this isle and many other men bury not no dead men, for\r\nthe heat is there so great, that in a little time the flesh will consume\r\nfrom the bones.\r\n\r\nFrom thence men go by sea toward Ind the more to a city, that men clepe\r\nSarche, that is a fair city and a good.  And there dwell many Christian\r\nmen of good faith.  And there be many religious men, and namely of\r\nmendicants.\r\n\r\nAfter go men by sea to the land of Lomb.  In that land groweth the pepper\r\nin the forest that men clepe Combar.  And it groweth nowhere else in all\r\nthe world, but in that forest, and that endureth well an eighteen\r\njourneys in length.  In the forest be two good cities; that one hight\r\nFladrine and that other Zinglantz, and in every of them dwell Christian\r\nmen and Jews, great plenty.  For it is a good country and a plentiful,\r\nbut there is overmuch passing heat.\r\n\r\nAnd ye shall understand, that the pepper groweth in manner as doth a wild\r\nvine that is planted fast by the trees of that wood for to sustain it by,\r\nas doth the vine.  And the fruit thereof hangeth in manner as raisins.\r\nAnd the tree is so thick charged, that it seemeth that it would break.\r\nAnd when it is ripe it is all green, as it were ivy berries.  And then\r\nmen cut them, as men do the vines, and then they put it upon an oven, and\r\nthere it waxeth black and crisp.  And there is three manner of pepper all\r\nupon one tree; long pepper, black pepper and white pepper.  The long\r\npepper men clepe _Sorbotin_, and the black pepper is clept _Fulfulle_,\r\nand the white pepper is clept _Bano_.  The long pepper cometh first when\r\nthe leaf beginneth to come, and it is like the cats of hazel that cometh\r\nbefore the leaf, and it hangeth low.  And after cometh the black with the\r\nleaf, in manner of clusters of raisins, all green.  And when men have\r\ngathered it, then cometh the white that is somedeal less than the black.\r\nAnd of that men bring but little into this country; for they beyond\r\nwithhold it for themselves, because it is better and more attempre in\r\nkind than the black.  And therefore is there not so great plenty as of\r\nthe black.\r\n\r\nIn that country be many manner of serpents and of other vermin for the\r\ngreat heat of the country and of the pepper.  And some men say, that when\r\nthey will gather the pepper, they make fire, and burn about to make the\r\nserpents and the cockodrills to flee.  But save their grace of all that\r\nsay so.  For if they burnt about the trees that bear, the pepper should\r\nbe burnt, and it would dry up all the virtue, as of any other thing; and\r\nthen they did themselves much harm, and they should never quench the\r\nfire.  But thus they do: they anoint their hands and their feet [with a\r\njuice] made of snails and of other things made therefore, of the which\r\nthe serpents and the venomous beasts hate and dread the savour; and that\r\nmaketh them flee before them, because of the smell, and then they gather\r\nit surely enough.\r\n\r\nAlso toward the head of that forest is the city of Polombe.  And above\r\nthe city is a great mountain that also is clept Polombe.  And of that\r\nmount the city hath his name.\r\n\r\nAnd at the foot of that mount is a fair well and a great, that hath odour\r\nand savour of all spices.  And at every hour of the day he changeth his\r\nodour and his savour diversely.  And whoso drinketh three times fasting\r\nof that water of that well he is whole of all manner sickness that he\r\nhath.  And they that dwell there and drink often of that well they never\r\nhave sickness; and they seem always young.  I have drunken thereof three\r\nor four sithes, and yet, methinketh, I fare the better.  Some men clepe\r\nit the well of youth.  For they that often drink thereof seem always\r\nyoung-like, and live without sickness.  And men say, that that well\r\ncometh out of Paradise, and therefore it is so virtuous.\r\n\r\nBy all that country groweth good ginger, and therefore thither go the\r\nmerchants for spicery.\r\n\r\nIn that land men worship the ox for his simpleness and for his meekness,\r\nand for the profit that cometh of him.  And they say, that he is the\r\nholiest beast in earth.  For them seemeth, that whosoever be meek and\r\npatient, he is holy and profitable; for then, they say, he hath all\r\nvirtues in him.  They make the ox to labour six year or seven, and then\r\nthey eat him.  And the king of the country hath alway an ox with him.\r\nAnd he that keepeth him hath every day great fees, and keepeth every day\r\nhis dung and his urine in two vessels of gold, and bring it before their\r\nprelate that they clepe Archi-protopapaton.  And he beareth it before the\r\nking and maketh there over a great blessing.  And then the king wetteth\r\nhis hands there, in that they clepe gall, and anointeth his front and his\r\nbreast.  And after, he froteth him with the dung and with the urine with\r\ngreat reverence, for to be fullfilled of virtues of the ox and made holy\r\nby the virtue of that holy thing that nought is worth.  And when the king\r\nhath done, then do the lords; and after them their ministers and other\r\nmen, if they may have any remenant.\r\n\r\nIn that country they make idols, half man half ox.  And in those idols\r\nevil spirits speak and give answer to men of what is asked them.  Before\r\nthese idols men slay their children many times, and spring the blood upon\r\nthe idols; and so they make their sacrifice.\r\n\r\nAnd when any man dieth in the country they burn his body in name of\r\npenance; to that intent, that he suffer no pain in earth to be eaten of\r\nworms.  And if his wife have no child they burn her with him, and say,\r\nthat it is reason, that she make him company in that other world as she\r\ndid in this.  But and she have children with him, they let her live with\r\nthem, to bring them up if she will.  And if that she love more to live\r\nwith her children than for to die with her husband, men hold her for\r\nfalse and cursed; ne she shall never be loved ne trusted of the people.\r\nAnd if the woman die, before the husband, men burn him with her, if that\r\nhe will; and if he will not, no man constraineth him thereto, but he may\r\nwed another time without blame or reproof.\r\n\r\nIn that country grow many strong vines.  And the women drink wine, and\r\nmen not.  And the women shave their beards, and the men not.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX\r\n\r\n\r\n_Of the Dooms made by St. Thomas’s hand_.  _Of devotion and sacrifice\r\nmade to Idols there_, _in the city of Calamye_; _and of the Procession in\r\ngoing about the city_\r\n\r\nFROM that country men pass by many marches toward a country, a ten\r\njourneys thence, that is clept Mabaron; and it is a great kingdom, and it\r\nhath many fair cities and towns.\r\n\r\nIn that kingdom lieth the body of Saint Thomas the apostle in flesh and\r\nbone, in a fair tomb in the city of Calamye; for there he was martyred\r\nand buried.  And men of Assyria bare his body into Mesopotamia into the\r\ncity of Edessa, and after, he was brought thither again.  And the arm and\r\nthe hand that he put in our Lord’s side, when he appeared to him after\r\nhis resurrection and said to him, _Noli esse incredulus_, _sed fidelis_,\r\nis yet lying in a vessel without the tomb.  And by that hand they make\r\nall their judgments in the country, whoso hath right or wrong.  For when\r\nthere is any dissension between two parties, and every of them\r\nmaintaineth his cause, and saith that his cause is rightful, and that\r\nother saith the contrary, then both parties write their causes in two\r\nbills and put them in the hand of Saint Thomas.  And anon he casteth away\r\nthe bill of the wrong cause and holdeth still the bill with the right\r\ncause.  And therefore men come from far countries to have judgment of\r\ndoubtable causes.  And other judgment use they none there.\r\n\r\nAlso the church, where Saint Thomas’ lieth, is both great and fair, and\r\nall full of great simulacres, and those be great images that they clepe\r\ntheir gods, of the which the least is as great as two men.\r\n\r\nAnd, amongst these other, there is a great image more than any of the\r\nother, that is all covered with fine gold and precious stones and rich\r\npearls; and that idol is the god of false Christians that have reneyed\r\ntheir faith.  And it sitteth in a chair of gold, full nobly arrayed, and\r\nhe hath about his neck large girdles wrought of gold and precious stones\r\nand pearls.  And this church is full richly wrought and, all overgilt\r\nwithin.  And to that idol go men on pilgrimage, as commonly and with as\r\ngreat devotion as Christian men go to Saint James, or other holy\r\npilgrimages.  And many folk that come from far lands to seek that idol\r\nfor the great devotion that they have, they look never upward, but\r\nevermore down to the earth, for dread to see anything about them that\r\nshould let them of their devotion.  And some there be that go on\r\npilgrimage to this idol, that bear knives in their hands, that be made\r\nfull keen and sharp; and always as they go, they smite themselves in\r\ntheir arms and in their legs and in their thighs with many hideous\r\nwounds; and so they shed their blood for love of that idol.  And they\r\nsay, that he is blessed and holy, that dieth so for love of his god.  And\r\nother there be that lead their children for to slay, to make sacrifice to\r\nthat idol; and after they have slain them they spring the blood upon the\r\nidol.  And some there be that come from far; and in going toward this\r\nidol, at every third pace that they go from their house, they kneel; and\r\nso continue till they come thither: and when they come there, they take\r\nincense and other aromatic things of noble smell, and cense the idol, as\r\nwe would do here God’s precious body.  And so come folk to worship this\r\nidol, some from an hundred mile, and some from many more.\r\n\r\nAnd before the minster of this idol, is a vivary, in manner of a great\r\nlake, full of water.  And therein pilgrims cast gold and silver, pearls\r\nand precious stones without number, instead of offerings.  And when the\r\nminister of that church need to make any reparation of the church or of\r\nany of the idols, they take gold and silver, pearls and precious stones\r\nout of the vivary, to quit the costage of such thing as they make or\r\nrepair; so that that nothing is faulty, but anon it shall be amended.\r\nAnd ye shall understand, that when [there be] great feasts and\r\nsolemnities of that idol, as the dedication of the church and the\r\nthroning of the idol, all the country about meet there together.  And\r\nthey set this idol upon a car with great reverence, well arrayed with\r\ncloths of gold, of rich cloths of Tartary, of Camaka, and other precious\r\ncloths.  And they lead him about the city with great solemnity.  And\r\nbefore the car go first in procession all the maidens of the country, two\r\nand two together full ordinatly.  And after those maidens go the\r\npilgrims.  And some of them fall down under the wheels of the car, and\r\nlet the car go over them, so that they be dead anon.  And some have their\r\narms or their limbs all to-broken, and some the sides.  And all this do\r\nthey for love of their god, in great devotion.  And them thinketh that\r\nthe more pain, and the more tribulation that they suffer for love of\r\ntheir god, the more joy they shall have in another world.  And, shortly\r\nto say you, they suffer so great pains, and so hard martyrdoms for love\r\nof their idol, that a Christian man, I trow, durst not take upon him the\r\ntenth part the pain for love of our Lord Jesu Christ.  And after, I say\r\nyou, before the car, go all the minstrels of the country without number,\r\nwith diverse instruments, and they make all the melody that they can.\r\n\r\nAnd when they have gone all about the city, then they return again to the\r\nminster, and put the idol again into his place.  And then for the love\r\nand in worship of that idol, and for the reverence of the feast, they\r\nslay themselves, a two hundred or three hundred persons, with sharp\r\nknives, of the which they bring the bodies before the idol.  And then\r\nthey say that those be saints, because that they slew themselves of their\r\nown good will for love of their idol.  And as men here that had an holy\r\nsaint of his kin would think that it were to them an high worship, right\r\nso then, thinketh there.  And as men here devoutly would write holy\r\nsaints’ lives and their miracles, and sue for their canonizations, right\r\nso do they there for them that slay themselves wilfully for love of their\r\nidol, and say, that they be glorious martyrs and saints, and put them in\r\ntheir writings and in their litanies, and avaunt them greatly, one to\r\nanother, of their holy kinsmen that so become saints, and say, I have\r\nmore holy saints in my kindred, than thou in thine!\r\n\r\nAnd the custom also there is this, that when they that have such devotion\r\nand intent for to slay himself for love of his god, they send for all\r\ntheir friends, and have great plenty of minstrels; and they go before the\r\nidol leading him that will slay himself for such devotion between them,\r\nwith great reverence.  And he, all naked, hath a full sharp knife in his\r\nhand, and he cutteth a great piece of his flesh, and casteth it in the\r\nface of his idol, saying his orisons, recommending him to his god.  And\r\nthen he smiteth himself and maketh great wounds and deep, here and there,\r\ntill he fall down dead.  And then his friends present his body to the\r\nidol.  And then they say, singing, Holy god! behold what thy true servant\r\nhath done for thee.  He hath forsaken his wife and his children and his\r\nriches, and all the goods of the world and his own life for the love of\r\nthee, and to make thee sacrifice of his flesh and of his blood.\r\nWherefore, holy god, put him among thy best beloved saints in thy bliss\r\nof paradise, for he hath well deserved it.  And then they make a great\r\nfire, and burn the body.  And then everych of his friends take a quantity\r\nof the ashes, and keep them instead of relics, and say that it is holy\r\nthing.  And they have no dread of no peril whiles they have those holy\r\nashes upon them.  And [they] put his name in their litanies as a saint.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX\r\n\r\n\r\n_Of the evil customs used in the Isle of Lamary_.  _And how the earth and\r\nthe sea be of round form and shape_, _by proof of the star that is clept\r\nAntarctic_, _that is fixed in the south_\r\n\r\nFROM that country go men by the sea ocean, and by many divers isles and\r\nby many countries that were too long for to tell of.  And a fifty-two\r\njourneys from this land that I have spoken of, there is another land,\r\nthat is full great, that men clepe Lamary.  In that land is full great\r\nheat.  And the custom there is such, that men and women go all naked.\r\nAnd they scorn when they see any strange folk going clothed.  And they\r\nsay, that God made Adam and Eve all naked, and that no man should shame\r\nhim to shew him such as God made him, for nothing is foul that is of\r\nkindly nature.  And they say, that they that be clothed be folk of\r\nanother world, or they be folk that trow not in God.  And they say, that\r\nthey believe in God that formed the world, and that made Adam and Eve and\r\nall other things.  And they wed there no wives, for all the women there\r\nbe common and they forsake no man.  And they say they sin if they refuse\r\nany man; and so God commanded to Adam and Eve and to all that come of\r\nhim, when he said, _Crescite et multiplicamini et replete terram_.  And\r\ntherefore may no man in that country say, This is my wife; ne no woman\r\nmay say, This my husband.  And when they have children, they may give\r\nthem to what man they will that hath companied with them.  And also all\r\nthe land is common; for all that a man holdeth one year, another man hath\r\nit another year; and every man taketh what part that him liketh.  And\r\nalso all the goods of the land be common, corns and all other things: for\r\nnothing there is kept in close, ne nothing there is under lock, and every\r\nman there taketh what he will without any contradiction, and as rich is\r\none man there as is another.\r\n\r\nBut in that country there is a cursed custom, for they eat more gladly\r\nman’s flesh than any other flesh; and yet is that country abundant of\r\nflesh, of fish, of corns, of gold and silver, and of all other goods.\r\nThither go merchants and bring with them children to sell to them of the\r\ncountry, and they buy them.  And if they be fat they eat them anon.  And\r\nif they be lean they feed them till they be fat, and then they eat them.\r\nAnd they say, that it is the best flesh and the sweetest of all the\r\nworld.\r\n\r\nIn that land, ne in many other beyond that, no man may see the Star\r\nTransmontane, that is clept the Star of the Sea, that is unmovable and\r\nthat is toward the north, that we clepe the Lode-star.  But men see\r\nanother star, the contrary to him, that is toward the south, that is\r\nclept Antartic.  And right as the ship-men take their advice here and\r\ngovern them by the Lode-star, right so do ship-men beyond those parts by\r\nthe star of the south, the which star appeareth not to us.  And this star\r\nthat is toward the north, that we clepe the Lode-star, ne appeareth not\r\nto them.  For which cause men may well perceive, that the land and the\r\nsea be of round shape and form; for the part of the firmament sheweth in\r\none country that sheweth not in another country.  And men may well prove\r\nby experience and subtle compassment of wit, that if a man found passages\r\nby ships that would go to search the world, men might go by ship all\r\nabout the world and above and beneath.\r\n\r\nThe which thing I prove thus after that I have seen.  For I have been\r\ntoward the parts of Brabant, and beholden the Astrolabe that the star\r\nthat is clept the Transmontane is fifty-three degrees high; and more\r\nfurther in Almayne and Bohemia it hath fifty-eight degrees; and more\r\nfurther toward the parts septentrional it is sixty-two degrees of height\r\nand certain minutes; for I myself have measured it by the Astrolabe.  Now\r\nshall ye know, that against the Transmontane is the tother star that is\r\nclept Antarctic, as I have said before.  And those two stars ne move\r\nnever, and by them turneth all the firmament right as doth a wheel that\r\nturneth by his axle-tree.  So that those stars bear the firmament in two\r\nequal parts, so that it hath as much above as it hath beneath.  After\r\nthis, I have gone toward the parts meridional, that is, toward the south,\r\nand I have found that in Lybia men see first the star Antarctic.  And so\r\nfar I have gone more further in those countries, that I have found that\r\nstar more high; so that toward the High Lybia it is eighteen degrees of\r\nheight and certain minutes (of the which sixty minutes make a degree).\r\nAfter going by sea and by land toward this country of that I have spoken,\r\nand to other isles and lands beyond that country, I have found the Star\r\nAntarctic of thirty-three degrees of height and more minutes.  And if I\r\nhad had company and shipping for to go more beyond, I trow well, in\r\ncertain, that we should have seen all the roundness of the firmament all\r\nabout.  For, as I have said to you before, the half of the firmament is\r\nbetween those two stars, the which halvendel I have seen.  And of the\r\ntother halvendel I have seen, toward the north under the Transmontane,\r\nsixty-two degrees and ten minutes, and toward the part meridional I have\r\nseen under the Antarctic, thirty-three degrees and sixteen minutes.  And\r\nthen, the halvendel of the firmament in all holdeth not but nine score\r\ndegrees.  And of those nine score, I have seen sixty-two on that one part\r\nand thirty-three on that other part; that be, ninety-five degrees and\r\nnigh the halvendel of a degree.  And so, there ne faileth but that I have\r\nseen all the firmament, save four score and four degrees and the\r\nhalvendel of a degree, and that is not the fourth part of the firmament;\r\nfor the fourth part of the roundness of the firmament holds four score\r\nand ten degrees, so there faileth but five degrees and an half of the\r\nfourth part.  And also I have seen the three parts of all the roundness\r\nof the firmament and more yet five degrees and a half.  By the which I\r\nsay you certainly that men may environ all the earth of all the world, as\r\nwell under as above, and turn again to his country, that had company and\r\nshipping and conduct.  And always he should find men, lands and isles, as\r\nwell as in this country.  For ye wit well, that they that be toward the\r\nAntarctic, they be straight, feet against feet, of them that dwell under\r\nthe Transmontane; also well as we and they that dwell under us be feet\r\nagainst feet.  For all the parts of sea and of land have their opposites,\r\nhabitable trepassable, and they of this half and beyond half.\r\n\r\nAnd wit well, that, after that that I may perceive and comprehend, the\r\nlands of Prester John, Emperor of Ind, be under us.  For in going from\r\nScotland or from England toward Jerusalem men go upward always.  For our\r\nland is in the low part of the earth toward the west, and the land of\r\nPrester John is in the low part of the earth toward the east.  And [they]\r\nhave there the day when we have the night; and also, high to the\r\ncontrary, they have the night when we have the day.  For the earth and\r\nthe sea be of round form and shape, as I have said before; and that that\r\nmen go upward to one coast, men go downward to another coast.\r\n\r\nAlso ye have heard me say that Jerusalem is in the midst of the world.\r\nAnd that may men prove, and shew there by a spear, that is pight into the\r\nearth, upon the hour of midday, when it is equinox, that sheweth no\r\nshadow on no side.  And that it should be in the midst of the world,\r\nDavid witnesseth it in the Psalter, where he saith, _Deus operatus est\r\nsalutem in media terrae_.  Then, they, that part from those parts of the\r\nwest for to go toward Jerusalem, as many journeys as they go upward for\r\nto go thither, in as many journeys may they go from Jerusalem unto other\r\nconfines of the superficiality of the earth beyond.  And when men go\r\nbeyond those journeys toward Ind and to the foreign isles, all is\r\nenvironing the roundness of the earth and of the sea under our countries\r\non this half.\r\n\r\nAnd therefore hath it befallen many times of one thing that I have heard\r\ncounted when I was young, how a worthy man departed some-time from our\r\ncountries for to go search the world.  And so he passed Ind and the isles\r\nbeyond Ind, where be more than 5000 isles.  And so long he went by sea\r\nand land, and so environed the world by many seasons, that he found an\r\nisle where he heard speak his own language, calling on oxen in the\r\nplough, such words as men speak to beasts in his own country whereof he\r\nhad great marvel, for he knew not how it might be.  But I say, that he\r\nhad gone so long by land and by sea, that he had environed all the earth;\r\nthat he was come again environing, that is to say, going about, unto his\r\nown marches, and if he would have passed further, till he had found his\r\ncountry and his own knowledge.  But he turned again from thence, from\r\nwhence he was come from.  And so he lost much painful labour, as himself\r\nsaid a great while after that he was come home.  For it befell after,\r\nthat he went into Norway.  And there tempest of the sea took him, and he\r\narrived in an isle.  And, when he was in that isle, he knew well that it\r\nwas the isle, where he had heard speak his own language before and the\r\ncalling of oxen at the plough; and that was possible thing.\r\n\r\nBut how it seemeth to simple men unlearned, that men ne may not go under\r\nthe earth, and also that men should fall toward the heaven from under.\r\nBut that may not be, upon less than we may fall toward heaven from the\r\nearth where we be.  For from what part of the earth that men dwell,\r\neither above or beneath, it seemeth always to them that dwell that they\r\ngo more right than any other folk.  And right as it seemeth to us that\r\nthey be under us, right so it seemeth to them that we be under them.  For\r\nif a man might fall from the earth unto the firmament, by greater, reason\r\nthe earth and the sea that be so great and so heavy should fall to the\r\nfirmament: but that may not be, and therefore saith our Lord God, _Non\r\ntimeas me_, _qui suspendi terram ex nihilo_?\r\n\r\nAnd albeit that it be possible thing that men may so environ all the\r\nworld, natheles, of a thousand persons, one ne might not happen to return\r\ninto his country.  For, for the greatness of the earth and of the sea,\r\nmen may go by a thousand and a thousand other ways, that no man could\r\nready him perfectly toward the parts that he came from, but if it were by\r\nadventure and hap, or by the grace of God.  For the earth is full large\r\nand full great, and holds in roundness and about environ, by above and by\r\nbeneath, 20425 miles, after the opinion of old wise astronomers; and\r\ntheir sayings I reprove nought.  But, after my little wit, it seemeth me,\r\nsaving their reverence, that it is more.\r\n\r\nAnd for to have better understanding I say thus.  Be there imagined a\r\nfigure that hath a great compass.  And, about the point of the great\r\ncompass that is clept the centre, be made another little compass.  Then\r\nafter, be the great compass devised by lines in many parts, and that all\r\nthe lines meet at the centre.  So, that in as many parts as the great\r\ncompass shall be departed, in as many shall be departed the little, that\r\nis about the centre, albeit that the spaces be less.  Now then, be the\r\ngreat compass represented for the firmament, and the little compass\r\nrepresented for the earth.  Now then, the firmament is devised by\r\nastronomers in twelve signs, and every sign is devised in thirty degrees;\r\nthat is, 360 degrees that the firmament hath above.  Also, be the earth\r\ndevised in as many parts as the firmament, and let every part answer to a\r\ndegree of the firmament.  And wit it well, that, after the authors of\r\nastronomy, 700 furlongs of earth answer to a degree of the firmament, and\r\nthose be eighty-seven miles and four furlongs.  Now be that here\r\nmultiplied by 360 sithes, and then they be 31,500 miles every of eight\r\nfurlongs, after miles of our country.  So much hath the earth in\r\nroundness and of height environ, after mine opinion and mine\r\nunderstanding.\r\n\r\nAnd ye shall understand, that after the opinion of old wise philosophers\r\nand astronomers, our country ne Ireland ne Wales ne Scotland ne Norway ne\r\nthe other isles coasting to them ne be not in the superficiality counted\r\nabove the earth, as it sheweth by all the books of astronomy.  For the\r\nsuperficiality of the earth is parted in seven parts for the seven\r\nplanets, and those parts be clept climates.  And our parts be not of the\r\nseven climates, for they be descending toward the west †[drawing] towards\r\nthe roundness of the world.  †And also these isles of Ind which be even\r\nagainst us be not reckoned in the climates.  For they be against us that\r\nbe in the low country.  And the seven climates stretch them environing\r\nthe world.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI\r\n\r\n\r\n_Of the Palace of the King of the Isle of Java_.  _Of the Trees that bear\r\nmeal_, _honey_, _wine_, _and venom_; _and of other marvels and customs\r\nused in the Isles marching thereabout_\r\n\r\nBESIDE that isle that I have spoken of, there is another isle that is\r\nclept Sumobor.  That is a great isle, and the king thereof is right\r\nmighty.  The folk of that isle make them always to be marked in the\r\nvisage with an hot iron, both men and women, for great noblesse, for to\r\nbe known from other folk; for they hold themselves most noble and most\r\nworthy of all the world.  And they have war always with the folk that go\r\nall naked.\r\n\r\nAnd fast beside is another isle, that is clept Betemga, that is a good\r\nisle and a plenteous.  And many other isles be thereabout, where there be\r\nmany of diverse folk, of the which it were too long to speak of all.\r\n\r\nBut fast beside that isle, for to pass by sea, is a great isle and a\r\ngreat country that men clepe Java.  And it is nigh two thousand mile in\r\ncircuit.  And the king of that country is a full great lord and a rich\r\nand a mighty, and hath under him seven other kings of seven other isles\r\nabout him.  This isle is full well inhabited, and full well manned.\r\nThere grow all manner of spicery, more plenteously than in any other\r\ncountry, as of ginger, cloves-gilofre, canell, seedwall, nutmegs and\r\nmaces.  And wit well, that the nutmeg beareth the maces; for right as the\r\nnut of the hazel hath an husk without, that the nut is closed in till it\r\nbe ripe and that after falleth out, right so it is of the nutmeg and of\r\nthe maces.  Many other spices and many other goods grow in that isle.\r\nFor of all things is there plenty, save only of wine.  But there is gold\r\nand silver, great plenty.\r\n\r\nAnd the king of that country hath a palace full noble and full\r\nmarvellous, and more rich than any in the world.  For all the degrees to\r\ngo up into halls and chambers be, one of gold, another of silver.  And\r\nalso, the pavements of halls and chambers be all square, of gold one, and\r\nanother of silver.  And all the walls within be covered with gold and\r\nsilver in fine plates, and in those plates be stories and battles of\r\nknights enleved, and the crowns and the circles about their heads be made\r\nof precious stones and rich pearls and great.  And the halls and the\r\nchambers of the palace be all covered within with gold and silver, so\r\nthat no man would trow the riches of that palace but he had seen it.  And\r\nwit well, that the king of that isle is so mighty, that he hath many\r\ntimes overcome the great Chan of Cathay in battle, that is the most great\r\nemperor that is under the firmament either beyond the sea or on this\r\nhalf.  For they have had often-time war between them, because that the\r\ngreat Chan would constrain him to hold his land of him; but that other at\r\nall times defendeth him well against him.\r\n\r\nAfter that isle, in going by sea, men find another isle, good and great,\r\nthat men clepe Pathen, that is a great kingdom full of fair cities and\r\nfull of towns.  In that land grow trees that bear meal, whereof men make\r\ngood bread and white and of good savour; and it seemeth as it were of\r\nwheat, but it is not allinges of such savour.  And there be other trees\r\nthat bear honey good and sweet, and other trees that bear venom, against\r\nthe which there is no medicine but [one]; and that is to take their\r\nproper leaves and stamp them and temper them with water and then drink\r\nit, and else he shall die; for triacle will not avail, ne none other\r\nmedicine.  Of this venom the Jews had let seek of one of their friends\r\nfor to empoison all Christianity, as I have heard them say in their\r\nconfession before their dying: but thanked be Almighty God! they failed\r\nof their purpose; but always they make great mortality of people.  And\r\nother trees there be also that bear wine of noble sentiment.  And if you\r\nlike to hear how the meal cometh out of the trees I shall say you.  Men\r\nhew the trees with an hatchet, all about the foot of the tree, till that\r\nthe bark be parted in many parts, and then cometh out thereof a thick\r\nliquor, the which they receive in vessels, and dry it at the heat of the\r\nsun; and then they have it to a mill to grind and it becometh fair meal\r\nand white.  And the honey and the wine and the venom be drawn out of\r\nother trees in the same manner, and put in vessels for to keep.\r\n\r\nIn that isle is a dead sea, that is a lake that hath no ground; and if\r\nanything fall into that lake it shall never come up again.  In that lake\r\ngrow reeds, that be canes, that they clepe Thaby, that be thirty fathoms\r\nlong; and of these canes men make fair houses.  And there be other canes\r\nthat be not so long, that grow near the land and have so long roots that\r\nendure well a four quarters of a furlong or more; and at the knots of\r\nthose roots men find precious stones that have great virtues.  And he\r\nthat beareth any of them upon him, iron ne steel may not hurt him, ne\r\ndraw no blood upon him; and therefore, they that have those stones upon\r\nthem fight full hardily both on sea and land, for men may not harm [them]\r\non no part.  And therefore, they that know the manner, and shall fight\r\nwith them, they shoot to them arrows and quarrels without iron or steel,\r\nand so they hurt them and slay them.  And also of those canes they make\r\nhouses and ships and other things, as we have here, making houses and\r\nships of oak or of any other trees.  And deem no man that I say it but\r\nfor a trifle, for I have seen of the canes with mine own eyes, full many\r\ntimes, lying upon the river of that lake, of the which twenty of our\r\nfellows ne might not lift up ne bear one to the earth.\r\n\r\nAfter this isle men go by sea to another isle that is clept Calonak.  And\r\nit is a fair land and a plenteous of goods.  And the king of that country\r\nhath as many wives as he will.  For he maketh search all the country to\r\nget him the fairest maidens that may be found, and maketh them to be\r\nbrought before him.  And he taketh one one night, and another another\r\nnight, and so forth continually suing; so that he hath a thousand wives\r\nor more.  And he lieth never but one night with one of them, and another\r\nnight with another; but if that one happen to be more lusty to his\r\npleasance than another.  And therefore the king getteth full many\r\nchildren, some-time an hundred, some-time a two-hundred, and some-time\r\nmore.  And he hath also into a 14,000 elephants or more that he maketh\r\nfor to be brought up amongst his villains by all his towns.  For in case\r\nthat he had any war against any other king about him, then [he] maketh\r\ncertain men of arms for to go up into the castles of tree made for the\r\nwar, that craftily be set upon the elephants’ backs, for to fight against\r\ntheir enemies.  And so do other kings there-about.  For the manner of war\r\nis not there as it is here or in other countries, ne the ordinance of war\r\nneither.  And men clepe the elephants _Warkes_.\r\n\r\nAnd in that isle there is a great marvel, more to speak of than in any\r\nother part of the world.  For all manner of fishes, that be there in the\r\nsea about them, come once in the year—each manner of diverse fishes, one\r\nmanner of kind after other.  And they cast themselves to the sea bank of\r\nthat isle so great plenty and multitude, that no man may unnethe see but\r\nfish.  And there they abide three days.  And every man of the country\r\ntaketh of them as many as him liketh.  And after, that manner of fish\r\nafter the third day departeth and goeth into the sea.  And after them\r\ncome another multitude of fish of another kind and do in the same manner\r\nas the first did, other three days.  And after them another, till all the\r\ndiverse manner of fishes have been there, and that men have taken of them\r\nthat them liketh.  And no man knoweth the cause wherefore it may be.  But\r\nthey of the country say that it is for to do reverence to their king,\r\nthat is the most worthy king that is in the world as they say; because\r\nthat he fulfilleth the commandment that God bade to Adam and Eve, when\r\nGod said, _Crescite et multiplicamini et replete terram_.  And for\r\nbecause that he multiplieth so the world with children, therefore God\r\nsendeth him so the fishes of diverse kinds of all that be in the sea, to\r\ntake at his will for him and all his people.  And therefore all the\r\nfishes of the sea come to make him homage as the most noble and excellent\r\nking of the world, and that is best beloved with God, as they say.  I\r\nknow not the reason, why it is, but God knoweth; but this, me-seemeth, is\r\nthe most marvel that ever I saw.  For this marvel is against kind and not\r\nwith kind, that the fishes that have freedom to environ all the coasts of\r\nthe sea at their own list, come of their own will to proffer them to the\r\ndeath, without constraining of man.  And therefore, I am siker that this\r\nmay not be, without a great token.\r\n\r\nThere be also in that country a kind of snails that be so great, that\r\nmany persons may lodge them in their shells, as men would do in a little\r\nhouse.  And other snails there be that be full great but not so huge as\r\nthe other.  And of these snails, and of great white worms that have black\r\nheads that be as great as a man’s thigh, and some less as great worms\r\nthat men find there in woods, men make viand royal for the king and for\r\nother great lords.  And if a man that is married die in that country, men\r\nbury his wife with him all quick; for men say there, that it is reason\r\nthat she make him company in that other world as she did in this.\r\n\r\nFrom that country men go by the sea ocean by an isle that is clept\r\nCaffolos.  Men of that country when their friends be sick they hang them\r\nupon trees, and say that it is better that birds, that be angels of God,\r\neat them, than the foul worms of the earth.\r\n\r\nFrom that isle men go to another isle, where the folk be of full cursed\r\nkind.  For they nourish great dogs and teach them to strangle their\r\nfriends when they be sick.  For they will not that they die of kindly\r\ndeath.  For they say, that they should suffer too great pain if they\r\nabide to die by themselves, as nature would.  And, when they be thus\r\nenstrangled, they eat their flesh instead of venison.\r\n\r\nAfterward men go by many isles by sea unto an isle that men clepe Milke.\r\nAnd there is a full cursed people.  For they delight in nothing more than\r\nfor to fight and to slay men.  And they drink gladliest man’s blood, the\r\nwhich they clepe Dieu.  And the more men that a man may slay, the more\r\nworship he hath amongst them.  And if two persons be at debate and,\r\nperadventure, be accorded by their friends or by some of their alliance,\r\nit behoveth that every of them that shall be accorded drink of other’s\r\nblood: and else the accord ne the alliance is nought worth: ne it shall\r\nnot be no reproof to him to break the alliance and the accord, but if\r\nevery of them drink of others’ blood.\r\n\r\nAnd from that isle men go by sea, from isle to isle, unto an isle that is\r\nclept Tracoda, where the folk of that country be as beasts, and\r\nunreasonable, and dwell in caves that they make in the earth; for they\r\nhave no wit to make them houses.  And when they see any man passing\r\nthrough their countries they hide them in their caves.  And they eat\r\nflesh of serpents, and they eat but little.  And they speak nought, but\r\nthey hiss as serpents do.  And they set no price by no avoir ne riches,\r\nbut only of a precious stone, that is amongst them, that is of sixty\r\ncolours.  And for the name of the isle, they clepe it Tracodon.  And they\r\nlove more that stone than anything else; and yet they know not the virtue\r\nthereof, but they covet it and love it only for the beauty.\r\n\r\nAfter that isle men go by the sea ocean, by many isles, unto an isle that\r\nis clept Nacumera, that is a great isle and good and fair.  And it is in\r\ncompass about, more than a thousand mile.  And all the men and women of\r\nthat isle have hounds’ heads, and they be clept Cynocephales.  And they\r\nbe full reasonable and of good understanding, save that they worship an\r\nox for their God.  And also every one of them beareth an ox of gold or of\r\nsilver in his forehead, in token that they love well their God.  And they\r\ngo all naked save a little clout, that they cover with their knees and\r\ntheir members.  They be great folk and well-fighting.  And they have a\r\ngreat targe that covereth all the body, and a spear in their hand to\r\nfight with.  And if they take any man in battle, anon they eat him.\r\n\r\nThe king of that isle is full rich and full mighty and right devout after\r\nhis law.  And he hath about his neck 300 pearls orient, good and great\r\nand knotted, as paternosters here of amber.  And in manner as we say our\r\n_Pater Noster_ and our _Ave Maria_, counting the _Pater Nosters_, right\r\nso this king saith every day devoutly 300 prayers to his God, or that he\r\neat.  And he beareth also about his neck a ruby orient, noble and fine,\r\nthat is a foot of length and five fingers large.  And, when they choose\r\ntheir king, they take him that ruby to bear in his hand; and so they lead\r\nhim, riding all about the city.  And from thence-fromward they be all\r\nobeissant to him.  And that ruby he shall bear always about his neck, for\r\nif he had not that ruby upon him men would not hold him for king.  The\r\ngreat Chan of Cathay hath greatly coveted that ruby, but he might never\r\nhave it for war, ne for no manner of goods.  This king is so rightful and\r\nof equity in his dooms, that men may go sikerly throughout all his\r\ncountry and bear with them what them list; that no man shall be hardy to\r\nrob them, and if he were, the king would justified anon.\r\n\r\nFrom this land men go to another isle that is clept Silha.  And it is\r\nwell a 800 miles about.  In that land is full much waste, for it is full\r\nof serpents, of dragons and of cockodrills, that no man dare dwell there.\r\nThese cockodrills be serpents, yellow and rayed above, and have four feet\r\nand short thighs, and great nails as claws or talons.  And there be some\r\nthat have five fathoms in length, and some of six and of eight and of\r\nten.  And when they go by places that be gravelly, it seemeth as though\r\nmen had drawn a great tree through the gravelly place.  And there be also\r\nmany wild beasts, and namely of elephants.\r\n\r\nIn that isle is a great mountain.  And in mid place of the mount is a\r\ngreat lake in a full fair plain; and there is great plenty of water.  And\r\nthey of the country say, that Adam and Eve wept upon that mount an\r\nhundred year, when they were driven out of Paradise, and that water, they\r\nsay, is of their tears; for so much water they wept, that made the\r\nforesaid lake.  And in the bottom of that lake men find many precious\r\nstones and great pearls.  In that lake grow many reeds and great canes;\r\nand there within be many cocodrills and serpents and great water-leeches.\r\nAnd the king of that country, once every year, giveth leave to poor men\r\nto go into the lake to gather them precious stones and pearls, by way of\r\nalms, for the love of God that made Adam.  And all the year men find\r\nenough.  And for the vermin that is within, they anoint their arms and\r\ntheir thighs and legs with an ointment made of a thing that is clept\r\nlemons, that is a manner of fruit like small pease; and then have they no\r\ndread of no cockodrills, ne of none other venomous vermin.  This water\r\nrunneth, flowing and ebbing, by a side of the mountain, and in that river\r\nmen find precious stones and pearls, great plenty.  And men of that isle\r\nsay commonly, that the serpents and the wild beasts of that country will\r\nnot do no harm ne touch with evil no strange man that entereth into that\r\ncountry, but only to men that be born of the same country.\r\n\r\nIn that country and others thereabout there be wild geese that have two\r\nheads.  And there be lions, all white and as great as oxen, and many\r\nother diverse beasts and fowls also that be not seen amongst us.\r\n\r\nAnd wit well, that in that country and in other isles thereabout, the sea\r\nis so high, that it seemeth as though it hung at the clouds, and that it\r\nwould cover all the world.  And that is great marvel that it might be so,\r\nsave only the will of God, that the air sustaineth it.  And therefore\r\nsaith David in the Psalter, _Mirabiles elationes maris_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXII\r\n\r\n\r\n_How men know by the Idol_, _if the sick shall die or not_.  _Of Folk of\r\ndiverse shape and marvellously disfigured_.  _And of the Monks that gave\r\ntheir relief to baboons_, _apes_, _and marmosets_, _and to other beasts_\r\n\r\nFROM that isle, in going by sea toward the south, is another great isle\r\nthat is clept Dondun.  In that isle be folk of diverse kinds, so that the\r\nfather eateth the son, the son the father, the husband the wife, and the\r\nwife the husband.  And if it so befall, that the father or mother or any\r\nof their friends be sick, anon the son goeth to the priest of their law\r\nand prayeth him to ask the idol if his father or mother or friend shall\r\ndie on that evil or not.  And then the priest and the son go together\r\nbefore the idol and kneel full devoutly and ask of the idol their demand.\r\nAnd if the devil that is within answer that he shall live, they keep him\r\nwell; and if he say that he shall die, then the priest goeth with the\r\nson, with the wife of him that is sick, and they put their hands upon his\r\nmouth and stop his breath, and so they slay him.  And after that, they\r\nchop all the body in small pieces, and pray all his friends to come and\r\neat of him that is dead.  And they send for all the minstrels of the\r\ncountry and make a solemn feast.  And when they have eaten the flesh,\r\nthey take the bones and bury them, and sing and make great melody.  And\r\nall those that be of his kin or pretend them to be his friends, an they\r\ncome not to that feast, they be reproved for evermore and shamed, and\r\nmake great dole, for never after shall they be holden as friends.  And\r\nthey say also, that men eat their flesh for to deliver them out of pain;\r\nfor if the worms of the earth eat them the soul should suffer great pain,\r\nas they say.  And namely when the flesh is tender and meagre, then say\r\ntheir friends, that they do great sin to let them have so long languor to\r\nsuffer so much pain without reason.  And when they find the flesh fat,\r\nthen they say, that it is well done to send them soon to Paradise, and\r\nthat they have not suffered him too long to endure in pain.\r\n\r\nThe king of this isle is a full great lord and a mighty, and hath under\r\nhim fifty-four great isles that give tribute to him.  And in everych of\r\nthese isles is a king crowned; and all be obeissant to that king.  And he\r\nhath in those isles many diverse folk.\r\n\r\nIn one of these isles be folk of great stature, as giants.  And they be\r\nhideous for to look upon.  And they have but one eye, and that is in the\r\nmiddle of the front.  And they eat nothing but raw flesh and raw fish.\r\n\r\nAnd in another isle toward the south dwell folk of foul stature and of\r\ncursed kind that have no heads.  And their eyen be in their shoulders.\r\n\r\nAnd in another isle be folk that have the face all flat, all plain,\r\nwithout nose and without mouth.  But they have two small holes, all\r\nround, instead of their eyes, and their mouth is plat also without lips.\r\n\r\nAnd in another isle be folk of foul fashion and shape that have the lip\r\nabove the mouth so great, that when they sleep in the sun they cover all\r\nthe face with that lip.\r\n\r\nAnd in another isle there be little folk, as dwarfs.  And they be two so\r\nmuch as the pigmies.  And they have no mouth; but instead of their mouth\r\nthey have a little round hole, and when they shall eat or drink, they\r\ntake through a pipe or a pen or such a thing, and suck it in, for they\r\nhave no tongue; and therefore they speak not, but they make a manner of\r\nhissing as an adder doth, and they make signs one to another as monks do,\r\nby the which every of them understandeth other.\r\n\r\nAnd in another isle be folk that have great ears and long, that hang down\r\nto their knees.\r\n\r\nAnd in another isle be folk that have horses’ feet.  And they be strong\r\nand mighty, and swift runners; for they take wild beasts with running,\r\nand eat them.\r\n\r\nAnd in another isle be folk that go upon their hands and their feet as\r\nbeasts.  And they be all skinned and feathered, and they will leap as\r\nlightly into trees, and from tree to tree, as it were squirrels or apes.\r\n\r\nAnd in another isle be folk that be both man and woman, and they have\r\nkind; of that one and of that other.  And they have but one pap on the\r\none side, and on that other none.  And they have members of generation of\r\nman and woman, and they use both when they list, once that one, and\r\nanother time that other.  And they get children, when they use the member\r\nof man; and they bear children, when they use the member of woman.\r\n\r\nAnd in another isle be folk that go always upon their knees full\r\nmarvellously.  And at every pace that they go, it seemeth that they would\r\nfall.  And they have in every foot eight toes.\r\n\r\nMany other diverse folk of diverse natures be there in other isles about,\r\nof the which it were too long to tell, and therefore I pass over shortly.\r\n\r\nFrom these isles, in passing by the sea ocean toward the east by many\r\njourneys, men find a great country and a great kingdom that men clepe\r\nMancy.  And that is in Ind the more.  And it is the best land and one the\r\nfairest that may be in all the world, and the most delectable and the\r\nmost plenteous of all goods that is in power of man.  In that land dwell\r\nmany Christian men and Saracens, for it is a good country and a great.\r\nAnd there be therein more than 2000 great cities and rich, without other\r\ngreat towns.  And there is more plenty of people there than in any other\r\npart of Ind, for the bounty of the country.  In that country is no needy\r\nman, ne none that goeth on begging.  And they be full fair folk, but they\r\nbe all pale.  And the men have thin beards and few hairs, but they be\r\nlong; but unnethe hath any man passing fifty hairs in his beard, and one\r\nhair sits here, another there, as the beard of a leopard or of a cat.  In\r\nthat land be many fairer women than in any other country beyond the sea,\r\nand therefore men clepe that land Albany, because that the folk be white.\r\n\r\nAnd the chief city of that country is clept Latorin, and it is a journey\r\nfrom the sea, and it is much more than Paris.  In that city is a great\r\nriver bearing ships that go to all the coasts in the sea.  No city of the\r\nworld is so well stored of ships as is that.  And all those of the city\r\nand of the country worship idols.  In that country be double sithes more\r\nbirds than be here.  There be white geese, red about the neck, and they\r\nhave a great crest as a cock’s comb upon their heads; and they be much\r\nmore there than they be here, and men buy them there all quick, right\r\ngreat cheap.  And there is great plenty of adders of whom men make great\r\nfeasts and eat them at great solemnities; and he that maketh there a\r\nfeast be it never so costly, an he have no adders he hath no thank for\r\nhis travail.\r\n\r\nMany good cities there be in that country and men have great plenty and\r\ngreat cheap of all wines and victuals.  In that country be many churches\r\nof religious men, and of their law.  And in those churches be idols as\r\ngreat as giants; and to these idols they give to eat at great festival\r\ndays in this manner.  They bring before them meat all sodden, as hot as\r\nthey come from the fire, and they let the smoke go up towards the idols;\r\nand then they say that the idols have eaten; and then the religious men\r\neat the meat afterwards.\r\n\r\nIn that country be white hens without feathers, but they bear white wool\r\nas sheep do here.  In that country women that be unmarried, they have\r\ntokens on their heads like coronals to be known for unmarried.  Also in\r\nthat country there be beasts taught of men to go into waters, into rivers\r\nand into deep stanks for to take fish; the which beast is but little, and\r\nmen clepe them loirs.  And when men cast them into the water, anon they\r\nbring up great fishes, as many as men will.  And if men will have more,\r\nthey cast them in again, and they bring up as many as men list to have.\r\n\r\nAnd from that city passing many journeys is another city, one the\r\ngreatest of the world, that men clepe Cassay; that is to say, the ‘City\r\nof heaven.’  That city is well a fifty mile about, and it is strongly\r\ninhabited with people, insomuch that in one house men make ten\r\nhouseholds.  In that city be twelve principal gates; and before every\r\ngate, a three mile or a four mile in length, is a great town or a great\r\ncity.  That city sits upon a great lake on the sea as doth Venice.  And\r\nin that city be more than 12,000 bridges.  And upon every bridge be\r\nstrong towers and good, in the which dwell the wardens for to keep the\r\ncity from the great Chan.  And on that one part of the city runneth a\r\ngreat river all along the city.  And there dwell Christian men and many\r\nmerchants and other folk of diverse nations, because that the land is so\r\ngood and so plenteous.  And there groweth full good wine that men clepe\r\nBigon, that is full mighty, and gentle in drinking.  This is a city royal\r\nwhere the King of Mancy was wont to dwell.  And there dwell many\r\nreligious men, as it were of the Order of Friars, for they be mendicants.\r\n\r\nFrom that city men go by water, solacing and disporting them, till they\r\ncome to an abbey of monks that is fast by, that be good religious men\r\nafter their faith and law.  In that abbey is a great garden and a fair,\r\nwhere be many trees of diverse manner of fruits.  And in this garden is a\r\nlittle hill full of delectable trees.  In that hill and in that garden be\r\nmany diverse beasts, as of apes, marmosets, baboons and many other\r\ndiverse beasts.  And every day, when the convent of this abbey hath\r\neaten, the almoner let bear the relief to the garden, and he smiteth on\r\nthe garden gate with a clicket of silver that he holdeth in his hand; and\r\nanon all the beasts of the hill and of diverse places of the garden come\r\nout a 3000, or a 4000; and they come in guise of poor men, and men give\r\nthem the relief in fair vessels of silver, clean over-gilt.  And when\r\nthey have eaten, the monk smiteth eftsoons on the garden gate with the\r\nclicket, and then anon all the beasts return again to their places that\r\nthey come from.  And they say that these beasts be souls of worthy men\r\nthat resemble in likeness of those beasts that be fair, and therefore\r\nthey give them meat for the love of God; and the other beasts that be\r\nfoul, they say be souls of poor men and of rude commons.  And thus they\r\nbelieve, and no man may put them out of this opinion.  These beasts\r\nabove-said they let take when they be young, and nourish them so with\r\nalms, as many as they may find.  And I asked them if it had not been\r\nbetter to have given that relief to poor men, rather than to those\r\nbeasts.  And they answered me and said, that they had no poor men amongst\r\nthem in that country; and though it had been so that poor men had been\r\namong them, yet were it greater alms to give it to those souls that do\r\nthere their penance.  Many other marvels be in that city and in the\r\ncountry thereabout, that were too long to tell you.\r\n\r\nFrom that city go men by the country a six journeys to another city that\r\nmen clepe Chilenfo, of the which city the walls be twenty mile about.  In\r\nthat city be sixty bridges of stone, so fair that no man may see fairer.\r\nIn that city was the first siege of the King of Mancy, for it is a fair\r\nand plenteous of all goods.\r\n\r\nAfter, pass men overthwart a great river that men clepe Dalay.  And that\r\nis the greatest river of fresh water that is in the world.  For there, as\r\nit is most narrow, it is more than four mile of breadth.  And then enter\r\nmen again into the land of the great Chan.\r\n\r\nThat river goeth through the land of Pigmies, where that the folk be of\r\nlittle stature, that be but three span long, and they be right fair and\r\ngentle, after their quantities, both the men and the women.  And they\r\nmarry them when they be half year of age and get children.  And they live\r\nnot but six year or seven at the most; and he that liveth eight year, men\r\nhold him there right passing old.  These men be the best workers of gold,\r\nsilver, cotton, silk and of all such things, of any other that be in the\r\nworld.  And they have oftentimes war with the birds of the country that\r\nthey take and eat.  This little folk neither labour in lands ne in vines;\r\nbut they have great men amongst them of our stature that till the land\r\nand labour amongst the vines for them.  And of those men of our stature\r\nhave they as great scorn and wonder as we would have among us of giants,\r\nif they were amongst us.  There is a good city, amongst others, where\r\nthere is dwelling great plenty of those little folk, and it is a great\r\ncity and a fair.  And the men be great that dwell amongst them, but when\r\nthey get any children they be as little as the pigmies.  And therefore\r\nthey be, all for the most part, all pigmies; for the nature of the land\r\nis such.  The great Chan let keep this city full well, for it is his.\r\nAnd albeit, that the pigmies be little, yet they be full reasonable after\r\ntheir age, and can both wit and good and malice enough.\r\n\r\nFrom that city go men by the country by many cities and many towns unto a\r\ncity that men clepe Jamchay; and it is a noble city and a rich and of\r\ngreat profit to the Lord, and thither go men to seek merchandise of all\r\nmanner of thing.  That city is full much worth yearly to the lord of the\r\ncountry.  For he hath every year to rent of that city (as they of the\r\ncity say) 50,000 cumants of florins of gold: for they count there all by\r\ncumants, and every cumant is 10,000 florins of gold.  Now may men well\r\nreckon how much that it amounteth.  The king of that country is full\r\nmighty, and yet he is under the great Chan.  And the great Chan hath\r\nunder him twelve such provinces.  In that country in the good towns is a\r\ngood custom: for whoso will make a feast to any of his friends, there be\r\ncertain inns in every good town, and he that will make the feast will say\r\nto the hosteler, array for me to-morrow a good dinner for so many folk,\r\nand telleth him the number, and deviseth him the viands; and he saith\r\nalso, thus much I will dispend and no more.  And anon the hosteler\r\narrayeth for him so fair and so well and so honestly, that there shall\r\nlack nothing; and it shall be done sooner and with less cost than an a\r\nman made it in his own house.\r\n\r\nAnd a five mile from that city, toward the head of the river of Dalay, is\r\nanother city that men clepe Menke.  In that city is strong navy of ships.\r\nAnd all be white as snow of the kind of the trees that they be made of.\r\nAnd they be full great ships and fair, and well ordained, and made with\r\nhalls and chambers and other easements, as though it were on the land.\r\n\r\nFrom thence go men, by many towns and many cities, through the country,\r\nunto a city that men clepe Lanterine.  And it is an eight journeys from\r\nthe city above-said.  This city sits upon a fair river, great and broad,\r\nthat men clepe Caramaron.  This river passeth throughout Cathay.  And it\r\ndoth often-time harm, and that full great, when it is over great.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIII\r\n\r\n\r\n_Of the great Chan of Cathay_.  _Of the royalty of his palace_, _and how\r\nhe sits at meat_; _and of the great number of officers that serve him_\r\n\r\nCATHAY is a great country and a fair, noble and rich, and full of\r\nmerchants.  Thither go merchants all years for to seek spices and all\r\nmanner of merchandises, more commonly than in any other part.  And ye\r\nshall understand, that merchants that come from Genoa or from Venice or\r\nfrom Romania or other parts of Lombardy, they go by sea and by land\r\neleven months or twelve, or more some-time, ere they may come to the isle\r\nof Cathay that is the principal region of all parts beyond; and it is of\r\nthe great Chan.\r\n\r\nFrom Cathay go men toward the east by many journeys.  And then men find a\r\ngood city between these others, that men clepe Sugarmago.  That city is\r\none of the best stored of silk and other merchandises that is in the\r\nworld.\r\n\r\nAfter go men yet to another old city toward the east.  And it is in the\r\nprovince of Cathay.  And beside that city the men of Tartary have let\r\nmake another city that is dept Caydon.  And it hath twelve gates, and\r\nbetween the two gates there is always a great mile; so that the two\r\ncities, that is to say, the old and the new, have in circuit more than\r\ntwenty mile.\r\n\r\nIn this city is the siege of the great Chan in a full great palace and\r\nthe most passing fair in all the world, of the which the walls be in\r\ncircuit more than two mile.  And within the walls it is all full of other\r\npalaces.  And in the garden of the great palace there is a great hill,\r\nupon the which there is another palace; and it is the most fair and the\r\nmost rich that any man may devise.  And all about the palace and the hill\r\nbe many trees bearing many diverse fruits.  And all about that hill be\r\nditches great and deep, and beside them be great vivaries on that one\r\npart and on that other.  And there is a full fair bridge to pass over the\r\nditches.  And in these vivaries be so many wild geese and ganders and\r\nwild ducks and swans and herons that it is without number.  And all about\r\nthese ditches and vivaries is the great garden full of wild beasts.  So\r\nthat when the great Chan will have any disport on that, to take any of\r\nthe wild beasts or of the fowls, he will let chase them and take them at\r\nthe windows without going out of his chamber.\r\n\r\nThis palace, where his siege is, is both great and passing fair.  And\r\nwithin the palace, in the hall, there be twenty-four pillars of fine\r\ngold.  And all the walls be covered within of red skins of beasts that\r\nmen clepe panthers, that be fair beasts and well smelling; so that for\r\nthe sweet odour of those skins no evil air may enter into the palace.\r\nThose skins be as red as blood, and they shine so bright against the sun,\r\nthat unnethe no man may behold them.  And many folk worship those beasts,\r\nwhen they meet them first at morning, for their great virtue and for the\r\ngood smell that they have.  And those skins they prize more than though\r\nthey were plate of fine gold.\r\n\r\nAnd in the midst of this palace is the mountour for the great Chan, that\r\nis all wrought of gold and of precious stones and great pearls.  And at\r\nfour corners of the mountour be four serpents of gold.  And all about\r\nthere is y-made large nets of silk and gold and great pearls hanging all\r\nabout the mountour.  And under the mountour be conduits of beverage that\r\nthey drink in the emperor’s court.  And beside the conduits be many\r\nvessels of gold, by the which they that be of household drink at the\r\nconduit.\r\n\r\nAnd the hall of the palace is full nobly arrayed, and full marvellously\r\nattired on all parts in all things that men apparel with any hall.  And\r\nfirst, at the chief of the hall is the emperor’s throne, full high, where\r\nhe sitteth at the meat.  And that is of fine precious stones, bordered\r\nall about with pured gold and precious stones, and great pearls.  And the\r\ngrees that he goeth up to the table be of precious stones mingled with\r\ngold.\r\n\r\nAnd at the left side of the emperor’s siege is the siege of his first\r\nwife, one degree lower than the emperor; and it is of jasper, bordered\r\nwith gold and precious stones.  And the siege of his second wife is also\r\nanother siege, more lower than his first wife; and it is also of jasper,\r\nbordered with gold, as that other is.  And the siege of the third wife is\r\nalso more low, by a degree, than the second wife.  For he hath always\r\nthree wives with him, where that ever he be.\r\n\r\nAnd after his wives, on the same side, sit the ladies of his lineage yet\r\nlower, after that they be of estate.  And all those that be married have\r\na counterfeit made like a man’s foot upon their heads, a cubit long, all\r\nwrought with great pearls, fine and orient, and above made with peacocks’\r\nfeathers and of other shining feathers; and that stands upon their heads\r\nlike a crest, in token that they be under man’s foot and under subjection\r\nof man.  And they that be unmarried have none such.\r\n\r\nAnd after at the right side of the emperor first sitteth his eldest son\r\nthat shall reign after him.  And he sitteth also one degree lower than\r\nthe emperor, in such manner of sieges as do the empresses.  And after him\r\nsit other great lords of his lineage, every of them a degree lower than\r\nthe other, as they be of estate.\r\n\r\nAnd the emperor hath his table alone by himself, that is of gold and of\r\nprecious stones, or of crystal bordered with gold, and full of precious\r\nstones or of amethysts, or of lignum aloes that cometh out of paradise,\r\nor of ivory bound or bordered with gold.  And every one of his wives hath\r\nalso her table by herself.  And his eldest son and the other lords also,\r\nand the ladies, and all that sit with the emperor have tables alone by\r\nthemselves, full rich.  And there ne is no table but that it is worth an\r\nhuge treasure of goods.\r\n\r\nAnd under the emperor’s table sit four clerks that write all that the\r\nemperor saith, be it good, be it evil; for all that he saith must be\r\nholden, for he may not change his word, ne revoke it.\r\n\r\nAnd [at] great solemn feasts before the emperor’s table men bring great\r\ntables of gold, and thereon be peacocks of gold and many other manner of\r\ndiverse fowls, all of gold and richly wrought and enamelled.  And men\r\nmake them dance and sing, clapping their wings together, and make great\r\nnoise.  And whether it be by craft or by necromancy I wot never; but it\r\nis a good sight to behold, and a fair; and it is great marvel how it may\r\nbe.  But I have the less marvel, because that they be the most subtle men\r\nin all sciences and in all crafts that be in the world: for of subtlety\r\nand of malice and of farcasting they pass all men under heaven.  And\r\ntherefore they say themselves, that they see with two eyes and the\r\nChristian men see but with one, because that they be more subtle than\r\nthey.  For all other nations, they say, be but blind in cunning and\r\nworking in comparison to them.  I did great business for to have learned\r\nthat craft, but the master told me that he had made avow to his god to\r\nteach it to no creature, but only to his eldest son.\r\n\r\nAlso above the emperor’s table and the other tables, and above a great\r\npart in the hall, is a vine made of fine gold.  And it spreadeth all\r\nabout the hall.  And it hath many clusters of grapes, some white, some\r\ngreen, some yellow and some red and some black, all of precious stones.\r\nThe white be of crystal and of beryl and of iris; the yellow be of\r\ntopazes; the red be of rubies and of grenaz and of alabrandines; the\r\ngreen be of emeralds, of perydoz and of chrysolites; and the black be of\r\nonyx and garantez.  And they be all so properly made that it seemeth a\r\nvery vine bearing kindly grapes.\r\n\r\nAnd before the emperor’s table stand great lords and rich barons and\r\nother that serve the emperor at the meat.  And no man is so hardy to\r\nspeak a word, but if the emperor speak to him; but if it be minstrels\r\nthat sing songs and tell jests or other disports, to solace with the\r\nemperor.  And all the vessels that men be served with in the hall or in\r\nchambers be of precious stones, and specially at great tables either of\r\njasper or of crystal or of amethysts or of fine gold.  And the cups be of\r\nemeralds and of sapphires, or of topazes, of perydoz, and of many other\r\nprecious stones.  Vessels of silver is there none, for they tell no price\r\nthereof to make no vessels of: but they make thereof grecings and pillars\r\nand pavements to halls and chambers.  And before the hall door stand many\r\nbarons and knights clean armed to keep that no man enter, but if it be\r\nthe will or the commandment of the emperor, or but if they be servants or\r\nminstrels of the household; and other none is not so hardy to neighen\r\nnigh the hall door.\r\n\r\nAnd ye shall understand, that my fellows and I with our yeomen, we served\r\nthis emperor, and were his soldiers fifteen months against the King of\r\nMancy, that held against him.  And the cause was for we had great lust to\r\nsee his noblesse and the estate of his court and all his governance, to\r\nwit if it were such as we heard say that it was.  And truly we found it\r\nmore noble and more excellent, and richer and more marvellous, than ever\r\nwe heard speak of, insomuch that we would never have lieved it had we not\r\nseen it.  For I trow, that no man would believe the noblesse, the riches\r\nne the multitude of folk that be in his court, but he had seen it; for it\r\nis not there as it is here.  For the lords here have folk of certain\r\nnumber as they may suffice; but the great Chan hath every day folk at his\r\ncostage and expense as without number.  But the ordinance, ne the\r\nexpenses in meat and drink, ne the honesty, ne the cleanness, is not so\r\narrayed there as it is here; for all the commons there eat without cloth\r\nupon their knees, and they eat all manner of flesh and little of bread,\r\nand after meat they wipe their hands upon their skirts, and they eat not\r\nbut once a day.  But the estate of lords is full great, and rich and\r\nnoble.\r\n\r\nAnd albeit that some men will not trow me, but hold it for fable to tell\r\nthem the noblesse of his person and of his estate and of his court and of\r\nthe great multitude of folk that he holds, natheles I shall say you a\r\npart of him and of his folk, after that I have seen the manner and the\r\nordinance full many a time.  And whoso that will may lieve me if he will,\r\nand whoso will not, may leave also.  For I wot well, if any man hath been\r\nin those countries beyond, though he have not been in the place where the\r\ngreat Chan dwelleth, he shall hear speak of him so much marvellous thing,\r\nthat he shall not trow it lightly.  And truly, no more did I myself, till\r\nI saw it.  And those that have been in those countries and in the great\r\nChan’s household know well that I say sooth.  And therefore I will not\r\nspare for them, that know not ne believe not but that that they see, for\r\nto tell you a part of him and of his estate that he holdeth, when he\r\ngoeth from country to country, and when he maketh solemn feasts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIV.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Wherefore he is clept the great Chan_.  _Of the Style of his Letters_:\r\n_and of the Superscription about his great Seal and his Privy Seal_\r\n\r\nFIRST I shall say you why he was clept the great Chan.\r\n\r\nYe shall understand, that all the world was destroyed by Noah’s flood,\r\nsave only Noah and his wife and his children.  Noah had three sons, Shem,\r\nCham, and Japhet.  This Cham was he that saw his father’s privy members\r\nnaked when he slept, and scorned them, and shewed them with his finger to\r\nhis brethren in scorning wise.  And therefore he was cursed of God.  And\r\nJaphet turned his face away and covered them.\r\n\r\nThese three brethren had seisin in all the land.  And this Cham, for his\r\ncruelty, took the greater and the best part, toward the east, that is\r\nclept Asia, and Shem took Africa, and Japhet took Europe.  And therefore\r\nis all the earth parted in these three parts by these three brethren.\r\nCham was the greatest and the most mighty, and of him came more\r\ngenerations than of the other.  And of his son Chuse was engendered\r\nNimrod the giant, that was the first king that ever was in the world; and\r\nhe began the foundation of the tower of Babylon.  And that time, the\r\nfiends of hell came many times and lay with the women of his generation\r\nand engendered on them diverse folk, as monsters and folk disfigured,\r\nsome without heads, some with great ears, some with one eye, some giants,\r\nsome with horses’ feet, and many other diverse shape against kind.  And\r\nof that generation of Cham be come the Paynims and divers folk that be in\r\nisles of the sea by all Ind.  And forasmuch as he was the most mighty,\r\nand no man might withstand him, he cleped himself the Son of God and\r\nsovereign of all the world.  And for this Cham, this emperor clepeth him\r\nCham, and sovereign of all the world.\r\n\r\nAnd of the generation of Shem be come the Saracens.  And of the\r\ngeneration of Japhet is come the people of Israel.  And though that we\r\ndwell in Europe, this is the opinion, that the Syrians and the Samaritans\r\nhave amongst them.  And that they told me, before that I went toward Ind,\r\nbut I found it otherwise.  Natheles, the sooth is this; that Tartars and\r\nthey that dwell in the great Asia, they came of Cham; but the Emperor of\r\nCathay clepeth him not Cham, but Can, and I shall tell you how.\r\n\r\nIt is but little more but eight score year that all Tartary was in\r\nsubjection and in servage to other nations about.  For they were but\r\nbestial folk and did nothing but kept beasts and led them to pastures.\r\nBut among them they had seven principal nations that were sovereigns of\r\nthem all.  Of the which, the first nation or lineage was clept Tartar,\r\nand that is the most noble and the most prized.  The second lineage is\r\nclept Tanghot, the third Eurache, the fourth Valair, the fifth Semoche,\r\nthe sixth Megly, the seventh Coboghe.\r\n\r\nNow befell it so that of the first lineage succeeded an old worthy man\r\nthat was not rich, that had to name Changuys.  This man lay upon a night\r\nin his bed.  And he saw in avision, that there came before him a knight\r\narmed all in white.  And he sat upon a white horse, and said to him, Can,\r\nsleepest thou?  The Immortal God hath sent me to thee, and it is his\r\nwill, that thou go to the seven lineages and say to them that thou shalt\r\nbe their emperor.  For thou shalt conquer the lands and the countries\r\nthat be about, and they that march upon you shall be under your\r\nsubjection, as ye have been under theirs, for that is God’s will\r\nimmortal.\r\n\r\nAnd when he came at morrow, Changuys rose, and went to seven lineages,\r\nand told them how the white knight had said.  And they scorned him, and\r\nsaid that he was a fool.  And so he departed from them all ashamed.  And\r\nthe night ensuing, this white knight came to the seven lineages, and\r\ncommanded them on God’s behalf immortal, that they should make this\r\nChanguys their emperor, and they should be out of subjection, and they\r\nshould hold all other regions about them in their servage as they had\r\nbeen to them before.  And on the morrow, they chose him to be their\r\nemperor.  And they set him upon a black fertre, and after that they lift\r\nhim up with great solemnity.  And they set him in a chair of gold and did\r\nhim all manner of reverence, and they cleped him Chan, as the white\r\nknight called him.\r\n\r\nAnd when he was thus chosen, he would assay if he might trust in them or\r\nno, and whether they would be obeissant to him or no.  And then he made\r\nmany statutes and ordinances that they clepe _Ysya Chan_.  The first\r\nstatute was, that they should believe and obey in God Immortal, that is\r\nAlmighty, that would cast them out of servage, and at all times clepe to\r\nhim for help in time of need.  The tother statute was, that all manner of\r\nmen that might bare arms should be numbered, and to every ten should be a\r\nmaster, and to every hundred a master, and to every thousand a master,\r\nand to every ten thousand a master.  After he commanded to the principals\r\nof the seven lineages, that they should leave and forsake all that they\r\nhad in goods and heritage, and from thenceforth to hold them paid of that\r\nthat he would give them of his grace.  And they did so anon.  After he\r\ncommanded to the principals of the seven lineages, that every of them\r\nshould bring his eldest son before him, and with their own hands smite\r\noff their heads without tarrying.  And anon his commandment was\r\nperformed.\r\n\r\nAnd when the Chan saw that they made none obstacle to perform his\r\ncommandment, then he thought well that he might trust in them, and\r\ncommanded them anon to make them ready and to sue his banner.  And after\r\nthis, Chan put in subjection all the lands about him.\r\n\r\nAfterward it befell upon a day, that the Can rode with a few meinie for\r\nto behold the strength of the country that he had won.  And so befell,\r\nthat a great multitude of enemies met with him.  And for to give good\r\nexample hardiness to his people, he was the first that fought, and in the\r\nmidst of his enemies encountered, and there he was cast from his horse,\r\nand his horse slain.  And when his folk saw him at the earth, they were\r\nall abashed, and weened he had been dead, and flew every one, and their\r\nenemies after and chased them, but they wist not that the emperor was\r\nthere.  And when the enemies were far pursuing the chase, the emperor hid\r\nhim in a thick wood.  And whet, they were come again from the chase, they\r\nwent and sought the woods if any of them had been hid in the thick of the\r\nwoods; and many they found and slew them anon.  So it happened that as\r\nthey went searching toward the place that the emperor was, they saw an\r\nowl sitting upon a tree above him; and then they said amongst them, that\r\nthere was no man because that they saw that bird there, and so they went\r\ntheir way; and thus escaped the emperor from death.  And then he went\r\nprivily all by night, till he came to his folk that were full glad of his\r\ncoming, and made great thankings to God Immortal, and to that bird by\r\nwhom their lord was saved.  And therefore principally above all fowls of\r\nworld they worship the owl; and when they have any of their feathers,\r\nthey keep them full preciously instead of relics, and bear them upon\r\ntheir heads with great reverence; and they hold themselves blessed and\r\nsafe from all perils while that they have them upon them, and therefore\r\nthey bear their feathers upon their heads.\r\n\r\nAfter all this the Chan ordained him, and assembled his people, and went\r\nupon them that had assailed him before, and destroyed them, and put them\r\nin subjection and servage.  And when he had won and put all the lands and\r\ncountries on this half the Mount Belian in subjection, the white knight\r\ncame to him again in his sleep, and said to him, Chan! the will of God\r\nImmortal is that thou pass the Mount Belian.  And thou shalt win the land\r\nand thou shalt put many nations in subjection.  And for thou shalt find\r\nno good passage for to go toward that country, go [to] the Mount Belian\r\nthat is upon the sea, and kneel there nine times toward the east in the\r\nworship of God Immortal, and he shall shew the way to pass by.  And the\r\nChan did so.  And anon the sea that touched and was fast to the mount\r\nbegan to withdraw him, and shewed fair way of nine foot breadth large;\r\nand so he passed with his folk, and won the land of Cathay that is the\r\ngreatest kingdom of the world.\r\n\r\nAnd for the nine kneelings and for the nine foot of way the Chan and all\r\nthe men of Tartary have the number of nine in great reverence.  And\r\ntherefore who that will make the Chan any present, be it of horses, be it\r\nof birds, or of arrows or bows, or of fruit, or of any other thing,\r\nalways he must make it of the number of nine.  And so then be the\r\npresents of greater pleasure to him; and more benignly he will receive\r\nthem than though he were presented with an hundred or two hundred.  For\r\nhim seemeth the number of nine so holy, because the messenger of God\r\nImmortal devised it.\r\n\r\nAlso, when the Chan of Cathay had won the country of Cathay, and put in\r\nsubjection and under foot many countries about, he fell sick.  And when\r\nhe felt well that he should die, he said to his twelve sons, that everych\r\nof them should bring him one of his arrows.  And so they did anon.  And\r\nthen he commanded that men should bind them together in three places.\r\nAnd then he took them to his eldest son, and bade him break them all\r\ntogether.  And he enforced him with all his might to break them, but he\r\nne might not.  And then the Chan bade his second son to break them; and\r\nso, shortly, to all, each after other; but none of them might break them.\r\nAnd then he bade the youngest son dissever every one from other, and\r\nbreak everych by himself.  And so he did.  And then said the Chan to his\r\neldest son and to all the others, Wherefore might ye not break them?  And\r\nthey answered that they might not, because that they were bound together.\r\nAnd wherefore, quoth he, hath your little youngest brother broken them?\r\nBecause, quoth they, that they were parted each from other.  And then\r\nsaid the Chan, My sons, quoth he, truly thus will it fare by you.  For as\r\nlong as ye be bound together in three places, that is to say, in love, in\r\ntruth and in good accord, no man shall be of power to grieve you.  But\r\nand ye be dissevered from these three places, that your one help not your\r\nother, ye shall be destroyed and brought to nought.  And if each of you\r\nlove other and help other, ye shall be lords and sovereigns of all\r\nothers.  And when he had made his ordinances, he died.\r\n\r\nAnd then after him reigned Ecchecha Cane, his eldest son.  And his other\r\nbrethren went to win them many countries and kingdoms, unto the land of\r\nPrussia and of Russia, and made themselves to be clept Chane; but they\r\nwere all obeissant to their elder brother, and therefore was he clept the\r\ngreat Chan.\r\n\r\nAfter Ecchecha reigned Guyo Chan.\r\n\r\nAnd after him Mango Chan that was a good Christian man and baptized, and\r\ngave letters of perpetual peace to all Christian men, and sent his\r\nbrother Halaon with great multitude of folk for to win the Holy Land and\r\nfor to put it into Christian men’s hands, and for to destroy Mahomet’s\r\nlaw, and for to take the Caliph of Bagdad that was emperor and lord of\r\nall the Saracens.  And when this caliph was taken, men found him of so\r\nhigh worship, that in all the remnant of the world, ne might a man find a\r\nmore reverend man, ne higher in worship.  And then Halaon made him come\r\nbefore him, and said to him, Why, quoth he, haddest thou not taken with\r\nthee more soldiers and men enough, for a little quantity of treasure, for\r\nto defend thee and thy country, that art so abundant of treasure and so\r\nhigh in all worship?  And the caliph answered him, For he well trowed\r\nthat he had enough of his own proper men.  And then said Halaon, Thou\r\nwert as a god of the Saracens.  And it is convenient to a god to eat no\r\nmeat that is mortal.  And therefore, thou shall not eat but precious\r\nstones, rich pearls and treasure, that thou lovest so much.  And then he\r\ncommanded him to prison, and all his treasure about him.  And so he died\r\nfor hunger and thirst.  And then after this, Halaon won all the Land of\r\nPromission, and put it into Christian men’s hands.  But the great Chan,\r\nhis brother, died; and that was great sorrow and loss to all Christian\r\nmen.\r\n\r\nAfter Mango Chan reigned Cobyla Chan that was also a Christian man.  And\r\nhe reigned forty-two year.  He founded the great city Izonge in Cathay,\r\nthat is a great deal more than Rome.\r\n\r\nThe tother great Chan that came after him became a Paynim, and all the\r\nothers after him.\r\n\r\nThe kingdom of Cathay is the greatest realm of the world.  And also the\r\ngreat Chan is the most mighty emperor of the world and the greatest lord\r\nunder the firmament.  And so he clepeth him in his letters, right thus:\r\n_Chan_!  _Filius Dei excelsi_, _omnium universam terram colentium summus\r\nimperator_, _& dominus omnium dominantium_!  And the letter of his great\r\nseal, written about, is this; _Deus in coelo_, _Chan super terram_, _ejus\r\nfortitudo_.  _Omnium hominum imperatoris sigillum_.  And the\r\nsuperscription about his little seal is this; _Dei fortitudo_, _omnium\r\nhominum imperatoris sigillum_.\r\n\r\nAnd albeit that they be not christened, yet nevertheless the emperor and\r\nall the Tartars believe in God Immortal.  And when they will menace any\r\nman, then they say, God knoweth well that I shall do thee such a thing,\r\nand telleth his menace.\r\n\r\nAnd thus have ye heard, why he is clept the great Chan.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXV\r\n\r\n\r\n_Of the Governance of the great Chan’s Court_, _and when he maketh solemn\r\nfeasts_.  _Of his Philosophers_.  _And of his array_, _when he rideth by\r\nthe country_\r\n\r\nNOW shall I tell you the governance of the court of the great Chan, when\r\nhe maketh solemn feasts; and that is principally four times in the year.\r\n\r\nThe first feast is of his birth, that other is of his presentation in\r\ntheir temple that they clepe their Moseache, where they make a manner of\r\ncircumcision, and the tother two feasts be of his idols.  The first feast\r\nof the idol is when he is first put into their temple and throned; the\r\ntother feast is when the idol beginneth first to speak, or to work\r\nmiracles.  More be there not of solemn feasts, but if he marry any of his\r\nchildren.\r\n\r\nNow understand, that at every of these feasts he hath great multitude of\r\npeople, well ordained and well arrayed, by thousands, by hundreds, and by\r\ntens.  And every man knoweth well what service he shall do, and every man\r\ngiveth so good heed and so good attendance to his service that no man\r\nfindeth no default.  And there be first ordained 4000 barons, mighty and\r\nrich, for to govern and to make ordinance for the feast, and for to serve\r\nthe emperor.  And these solemn feasts be made without in halls and tents\r\nmade of cloths of gold and of tartaries, full nobly.  And all those\r\nbarons have crowns of gold upon their heads, full noble and rich, full of\r\nprecious stones and great pearls orient.  And they be all clothed in\r\ncloths of gold or of tartaries or of camakas, so richly and so perfectly,\r\nthat no man in the world can amend it, ne better devise it.  And all\r\nthose robes be orfrayed all about, and dubbed full of precious stones and\r\nof great orient pearls, full richly.  And they may well do so, for cloths\r\nof gold and of silk be greater cheap there a great deal than be cloths of\r\nwool.  And these 4000 barons be devised in four companies, and every\r\nthousand is clothed in cloths all of one colour, and that so well arrayed\r\nand so richly, that it is marvel to behold.\r\n\r\nThe first thousand, that is of dukes, of earls, of marquises and of\r\nadmirals, all clothed in cloths of gold, with tissues of green silk, and\r\nbordered with gold full of precious stones in manner as I have said\r\nbefore.  The second thousand is all clothed in cloths diapered of red\r\nsilk, all wrought with gold, and the orfrays set full of great pearl and\r\nprecious stones, full nobly wrought.  The third thousand is clothed in\r\ncloths of silk, of purple or of Ind.  And the fourth thousand is in\r\ncloths of yellow.  And all their clothes be so nobly and so richly\r\nwrought with gold and precious stones and rich pearls, that if a man of\r\nthis country had but only one of their robes, he might well say that he\r\nshould never be poor; for the gold and the precious stones and the great\r\norient pearls be of greater value on this half the sea than they be\r\nbeyond the sea in those countries.\r\n\r\nAnd when they be thus apparelled, they go two and two together, full\r\nordinately, before the emperor, without speech of any word, save only\r\ninclining to him.  And every one of them beareth a tablet of jasper or of\r\nivory or of crystal, and the minstrels going before them, sounding their\r\ninstruments of diverse melody.  And when the first thousand is thus\r\npassed and hath made his muster, he withdraweth him on that one side; and\r\nthen entereth that other second thousand, and doth right so, in the same\r\nmanner of array and countenance, is did the first; and after, the third;\r\nand then, the fourth; and none of them saith not one word.\r\n\r\nAnd at one side of the emperor’s table sit many philosophers that be\r\nproved for wise men in many diverse sciences, as of astronomy,\r\nnecromancy, geomancy, pyromancy, hydromancy, of augury and of many other\r\nsciences.  And everych of them have before them astrolabes of gold, some\r\nspheres, some the brain pan of a dead man, some vessels of gold full of\r\ngravel or sand, some vessels of gold full of coals burning, some vessels\r\nof gold full of water and of wine and of oil, and some horologes of gold,\r\nmade full nobly and richly wrought, and many other manner of instruments\r\nafter their sciences.\r\n\r\nAnd at certain hours, when them thinketh time, they say to certain\r\nofficers that stand before them, ordained for the time to fulfil their\r\ncommandments; Make peace!\r\n\r\nAnd then say the officers; Now peace! listen!\r\n\r\nAnd after that, saith another of the philosophers; Every man do reverence\r\nand incline to the emperor, that is God’s Son and sovereign lord of all\r\nthe world!  For now is time!  And then every man boweth his head toward\r\nthe earth.\r\n\r\nAnd then commandeth the same philosopher again; Stand up!  And they do\r\nso.\r\n\r\nAnd at another hour, saith another philosopher; Put your little finger in\r\nyour ears!  And anon they do so.\r\n\r\nAnd at another hour, saith another philosopher; Put your hand before your\r\nmouth!  And anon they do so.\r\n\r\nAnd at another hour, saith another philosopher; Put your hand upon your\r\nhead!  And after that he biddeth them to do their hand away.  And they do\r\nso.\r\n\r\nAnd so, from hour to hour, they command certain things; and they say,\r\nthat those things have diverse significations.  And I asked them privily\r\nwhat those things betokened.  And one of the masters told me, that the\r\nbowing of the head at that hour betokened this; that all those that bowed\r\ntheir heads should evermore after be obeissant and true to the emperor,\r\nand never, for gifts ne for promise in no kind, to be false ne traitor\r\nunto him for good nor evil.  And the putting of the little finger in the\r\near betokeneth, as they say, that none of them ne shall not hear speak no\r\ncontrarious thing to the emperor but that he shall tell it anon to his\r\ncouncil or discover it to some men that will make relation to the\r\nemperor, though he were his father or brother or son.  And so forth, of\r\nall other things that is done by the philosophers, they told me the\r\ncauses of many diverse things.  And trust right well in certain, that no\r\nman doth nothing to the emperor that belongeth unto him, neither clothing\r\nne bread ne wine ne bath ne none other thing that longeth to him, but at\r\ncertain hours that his philosophers will devise.  And if there fall war\r\nin any side to the emperor, anon the philosophers come and say their\r\nadvice after their calculations, and counsel the emperor of their advice\r\nby their sciences; so that the emperor doth nothing without their\r\ncounsel.\r\n\r\nAnd when the philosophers have done and performed their commandments,\r\nthen the minstrels begin to do their minstrelsy, everych in their\r\ninstruments, each after other, with all the melody that they can devise.\r\nAnd when they have done a good while, one of the officers of the emperor\r\ngoeth up on a high stage wrought full curiously, and crieth and saith\r\nwith loud voice; Make Peace!  And then every man is still.\r\n\r\nAnd then, anon after, all the lords that be of the emperor’s lineage,\r\nnobly arrayed in rich cloths of gold and royally apparelled on white\r\nsteeds, as many as may well sue him at that time, be ready to make their\r\npresents to the emperor.  And then saith the steward of the court to the\r\nlords, by name; N. of N.! and nameth first the most noble and the\r\nworthiest by name, and saith; Be ye ready with such a number of white\r\nhorses, for to serve the emperor, your sovereign lord!  And to another\r\nlord he saith; N. of N., be ye ready with such a number, to serve your\r\nsovereign lord!  And to another, right so, and to all the lords of the\r\nemperor’s lineage, each after other, as they be of estate.  And when they\r\nbe all cleped, they enter each after other, and present the white horses\r\nto the emperor, and then go their way.  And then after, all the other\r\nbarons every of them, give him presents or jewels or some other thing,\r\nafter that they be of estate.  And then after them, all the prelates of\r\ntheir law, and religious men and others; and every man giveth him\r\nsomething.  And when that all men have thus presented the emperor, the\r\ngreatest of dignity of the prelates giveth him a blessing, saying an\r\norison of their law.\r\n\r\nAnd then begin the minstrels to make their minstrelsy in divers\r\ninstruments with all the melody that they can devise.  And when they have\r\ndone their craft, then they bring before the emperor, lions, leopards and\r\nother diverse beasts, and eagles and vultures and other divers fowls, and\r\nfishes and serpents, for to do him reverence.  And then come jugglers and\r\nenchanters, that do many marvels; for they make to come in the air, by\r\nseeming, the sun and the moon to every man’s sight.  And after they make\r\nthe night so dark that no man may see nothing.  And after they make the\r\nday to come again, fair and pleasant with bright sun, to every man’s\r\nsight.  And then they bring in dances of the fairest damsels of the\r\nworld, and richest arrayed.  And after they make to come in other damsels\r\nbringing cups of gold full of milk of diverse beasts, and give drink to\r\nlords and to ladies.  And then they make knights to joust in arms full\r\nlustily; and they run together a great random, and they frussch together\r\nfull fiercely, and they break their spears so rudely that the truncheons\r\nfly in sprouts and pieces all about the hall.  And then they make to come\r\nin hunting for the hart and for the boar, with hounds running with open\r\nmouth.  And many other things they do by craft of their enchantments,\r\nthat it is marvel for to see.  And such plays of disport they make till\r\nthe taking up of the boards.  This great Chan hath full great people for\r\nto serve him, as I have told you before.  For he hath of minstrels the\r\nnumber of thirteen cumants, but they abide not always with him.  For all\r\nthe minstrels that come before him, of what nation that they be of, they\r\nbe withholden with him as of his household, and entered in his books as\r\nfor his own men.  And after that, where that ever they go, ever more they\r\nclaim for minstrels of the great Chan; and under that title, all kings\r\nand lords cherish them the more with gifts and all things.  And therefore\r\nhe hath so great multitude of them.\r\n\r\nAnd he hath of certain men as though they were yeomen, that keep birds,\r\nas ostriches, gerfalcons, sparrow-hawks, falcons gentle, lanyers, sakers,\r\nsakrets, popinjays well speaking, and birds singing, and also of wild\r\nbeasts, as of elephants tame and other, baboons, apes, marmosets, and\r\nother diverse beasts; the mountance of fifteen cumants of yeomen.\r\n\r\nAnd of physicians Christian he hath 200, and of leeches that be Christian\r\nhe hath 210, and of leeches and physicians that be Saracens twenty, but\r\nhe trusteth more in the Christian leeches than in the Saracen.  And his\r\nother common household is without number, and they all have all\r\nnecessaries and all that them needeth of the emperor’s court.  And he\r\nhath in his court many barons as servitors, that be Christian and\r\nconverted to good faith by the preaching of religious Christian men that\r\ndwell with him; but there be many more, that will not that men know that\r\nthey be Christian.\r\n\r\nThis emperor may dispend as much as he will without estimation; for he\r\nnot dispendeth ne maketh no money but of leather imprinted or of paper.\r\nAnd of that money is some of greater price and some of less price, after\r\nthe diversity of his statutes.  And when that money hath run so long that\r\nit beginneth to waste, then men bear it to the emperor’s treasury and\r\nthen they take new money for the old.  And that money goeth throughout\r\nall the country and throughout all his provinces, for there and beyond\r\nthem they make no money neither of gold nor of silver; and therefore he\r\nmay dispend enough, and outrageously.  And of gold and silver that men\r\nbear in his country he maketh cylours, pillars and pavements in his\r\npalace, and other diverse things what him liketh.\r\n\r\nThis emperor hath in his chamber, in one of the pillars of gold, a ruby\r\nand a carbuncle of half a foot long, that in the night giveth so great\r\nclearness and shining, that it is as light as day.  And he hath many\r\nother precious stones and many other rubies and carbuncles; but those be\r\nthe greatest and the most precious.\r\n\r\nThis emperor dwelleth in summer in a city that is toward the north that\r\nis clept Saduz; and there is cold enough.  And in winter he dwelleth in a\r\ncity that is clept Camaaleche, and that is an hot country.  But the\r\ncountry, where he dwelleth in most commonly, is in Gaydo or in Jong, that\r\nis a good country and a temperate, after that the country is there; but\r\nto men of this country it were too passing hot.\r\n\r\nAnd when this emperor will ride from one country to another he ordaineth\r\nfour hosts of his folk, of the which the first host goeth before him a\r\nday’s journey.  For that host shall be lodged the night where the emperor\r\nshall lie upon the morrow.  And there shall every man have all manner of\r\nvictual and necessaries that be needful, of the emperor’s costage.  And\r\nin this first host is the number of people fifty cumants, what of horse\r\nwhat of foot, of the which every cumant amounteth 10,000 as I have told\r\nyou before.  And another host goeth in the right side of the emperor,\r\nnigh half a journey from him.  And another goeth on the left side of him,\r\nin the same wise.  And in every host is as much multitude of people as in\r\nthe first host.  And then after cometh the fourth host, that is much more\r\nthan any of the others, and that goeth behind him, the mountance of a bow\r\ndraught.  And every host hath his journeys ordained in certain places,\r\nwhere they shall be lodged at night, and there they shall have all that\r\nthem needeth.  And if it befall that any of the host die, anon they put\r\nanother in his place, so that the number shall evermore be whole.\r\n\r\nAnd ye shall understand, that the emperor, in his proper person, rideth\r\nnot as other great lords do beyond, but if he list to go privily with few\r\nmen, for to be unknown.  And else, he rides in a chariot with four\r\nwheels, upon the which is made a fair chamber, and it is made of a\r\ncertain wood, that cometh out of Paradise terrestrial, that men clepe\r\nlignum aloes, that the floods of Paradise bring out at divers seasons, as\r\nI have told you here before.  And this chamber is full well smelling\r\nbecause of the wood that it is made of.  And all this chamber is covered\r\nwithin of plate of fine gold dubbed with precious stones and great\r\npearls.  And four elephants and four great destriers, all white and\r\ncovered with rich covertures, leading the chariot.  And four, or five, or\r\nsix, of the greatest lords ride about this chariot, full richly arrayed\r\nand full nobly, so that no man shall neigh the chariot, but only those\r\nlords, but if that the emperor call any man to him that him list to speak\r\nwithal.  And above the chamber of this chariot that the emperor sitteth\r\nin be set upon a perch four or five or six gerfalcons, to that intent,\r\nthat when the emperor seeth any wild fowl, that he may take it at his own\r\nlist, and have the disport and the play of the flight, first with one,\r\nand after with another; and so he taketh his disport passing by the\r\ncountry.  And no man rideth before him of his company, but all after him.\r\nAnd no man dare not come nigh the chariot, by a bow draught, but those\r\nlords only that be about him.  And all the host cometh fairly after him\r\nin great multitude.\r\n\r\nAnd also such another chariot with such hosts ordained and arrayed go\r\nwith the empress upon another side, everych by himself, with four hosts,\r\nright as the emperor did; but not with so great multitude of people.  And\r\nhis eldest son goeth by another way in another chariot, in the same\r\nmanner.  So that there is between them so great multitude of folk that it\r\nis marvel to tell it.  And no man should trow the number, but he had seen\r\nit.  And some-time it happeth that when he will not go far, and that it\r\nlike him to have the empress and his children with him, then they go\r\naltogether, and their folk be all mingled in fere, and divided in four\r\nparties only.\r\n\r\nAnd ye shall understand, that the empire of this great Chan is divided in\r\ntwelve provinces; and every province hath more than two thousand cities,\r\nand of towns without number.  This country is full great, for it hath\r\ntwelve principal kings in twelve provinces, and every of those Kings have\r\nmany kings under them, and all they be obeissant to the great Chan.  And\r\nhis land and his lordship dureth so far, that a man may not go from one\r\nhead to another, neither by sea ne land, the space of seven year.  And\r\nthrough the deserts of his lordship, there as men may find no towns,\r\nthere be inns ordained by every journey, to receive both man and horse,\r\nin the which they shall find plenty of victual, and of all things that\r\nthey need for to go by the country.\r\n\r\nAnd there is a marvellous custom in that country (but it is profitable),\r\nthat if any contrarious thing that should be prejudice or grievance to\r\nthe emperor in any kind, anon the emperor hath tidings thereof and full\r\nknowledge in a day, though it be three or four journeys from him or more.\r\nFor his ambassadors take their dromedaries or their horses, and they\r\nprick in all that ever they may toward one of the inns.  And when they\r\ncome there, anon they blow an horn.  And anon they of the inn know well\r\nenough that there be tidings to warn the emperor of some rebellion\r\nagainst him.  And then anon they make other men ready, in all haste that\r\nthey may, to bear letters, and prick in all that ever they may, till they\r\ncome to the other inns with their letters.  And then they make fresh men\r\nready, to prick forth with the letters toward the emperor, while that the\r\nlast bringer rest him, and bait his dromedary or his horse.  And so, from\r\ninn to inn, till it come to the emperor.  And thus anon hath he hasty\r\ntidings of anything that beareth charge, by his couriers, that run so\r\nhastily throughout all the country.  And also when the Emperor sendeth\r\nhis couriers hastily throughout his land, every one of them hath a large\r\nthrong full of small bells, and when they neigh near to the inns of other\r\ncouriers that be also ordained by the journeys, they ring their bells,\r\nand anon the other couriers make them ready, and run their way unto\r\nanother inn.  And thus runneth one to other, full speedily and swiftly,\r\ntill the emperor’s intent be served, in all haste.  And these couriers be\r\nclept _Chydydo_, after their language, that is to say, a messenger,\r\n\r\nAlso when the emperor goeth from one country to another, as I have told\r\nyou here before, and he pass through cities and towns, every man maketh a\r\nfire before his door, and putteth therein powder of good gums that be\r\nsweet smelling, for to make good savour to the emperor.  And all the\r\npeople kneel down against him, and do him great reverence.  And there,\r\nwhere religious Christian men dwell, as they do in many cities in the\r\nland, they go before him with procession with cross and holy water, and\r\nthey sing, _Veni creator spiritus_! with an high voice, and go towards\r\nhim.  And when he heareth them, he commandeth to his lords to ride beside\r\nhim, that the religious men may come to him.  And when they be nigh him\r\nwith the cross, then he doth adown his galiot that sits on his head in\r\nmanner of a chaplet, that is made of gold and precious stones and great\r\npearls, and it is so rich, that men prize it to the value of a realm in\r\nthat country.  And then he kneeleth to the cross.  And then the prelate\r\nof the religious men saith before him certain orisons, and giveth him a\r\nblessing with the cross; and he inclineth to the blessing full devoutly.\r\nAnd then the prelate giveth him some manner fruit, to the number of nine,\r\nin a platter of silver, with pears or apples, or other manner fruit.  And\r\nhe taketh one.  And then men give to the other lords that be about him.\r\nFor the custom is such, that no stranger shall come before him, but if he\r\ngive him some manner thing, after the old law that saith, _Nemo accedat\r\nin conspectu meo vacuus_.  And then the emperor saith to the religious\r\nmen, that they withdraw them again, that they be neither hurt nor harmed\r\nof the great multitude of horses that come behind him.  And also, in the\r\nsame manner, do the religious men that dwell there, to the empresses that\r\npass by them, and to his eldest son.  And to every of them they present\r\nfruit.\r\n\r\nAnd ye shall understand, that the people that he hath so many hosts of,\r\nabout him and about his wives and his soil, they dwell not continually\r\nwith him.  But always, when him liketh, they be sent for.  And after,\r\nwhen they have done, they return to their own households, save only they\r\nthat be dwelling with him in household for to serve him and his wives and\r\nhis sons for to govern his household.  And albeit, that the others be\r\ndeparted from him after that they have performed their service, yet there\r\nabideth continually with him in court 50,000 men at horse and 200,000 men\r\na foot, without minstrels and those that keep wild beasts and divers\r\nbirds, of the which I have told you the number before.\r\n\r\nUnder the firmament is not so great a lord, ne so mighty, ne so rich as\r\nis the great Chan; not Prester John, that is emperor of the high Ind, ne\r\nthe Soldan of Babylon, ne the Emperor of Persia.  All these ne be not in\r\ncomparison to the great Chan, neither of might, ne of noblesse, ne of\r\nroyalty, ne of riches; for in all these he passeth all earthly princes.\r\nWherefore it is great harm that he believeth not faithfully in God.  And\r\nnatheles he will gladly hear speak of God.  And he suffereth well that\r\nChristian men dwell in his lordship, and that men of his faith be made\r\nChristian men if they will, throughout all his country; for he defendeth\r\nno man to hold no law other than him liketh.\r\n\r\nIn that country some men hath an hundred wives, some sixty, some more,\r\nsome less.  And they take the next of their kin to their wives, save only\r\nthat they out-take their mothers, their daughters, and their sisters of\r\nthe mother’s side; but their sisters on the father’s side of another\r\nwoman they may well take, and their brothers’ wives also after their\r\ndeath, and their step-mothers also in the same wise.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVI\r\n\r\n\r\n_Of the Law and the Customs of the Tartarians dwelling in Cathay_.  _And\r\nhow that men do when the Emperor shall die_, _and how he shall be chosen_\r\n\r\nTHE folk of that country use all long clothes without furs.  And they be\r\nclothed with precious cloths of Tartary, and of cloths of gold.  And\r\ntheir clothes be slit at the side, and they be fastened with laces of\r\nsilk.  And they clothe them also with pilches, and the hide without; and\r\nthey use neither cape ne hood.  And in the same manner as the men go, the\r\nwomen go, so that no man may unneth know the men from the women, save\r\nonly those women that be married, that bear the token upon their heads of\r\na man’s foot, in sign that they be under man’s foot and under subjection\r\nof man.\r\n\r\nAnd their wives ne dwell not together, but every of them by herself; and\r\nthe husband may lie with whom of them that him liketh.  Everych hath his\r\nhouse, both man and woman.  And their houses be made round of staves, and\r\nit hath a round window above that giveth them light, and also that\r\nserveth for deliverance of smoke.  And the heling of their houses and the\r\nwalls and the doors be all of wood.  And when they go to war, they lead\r\ntheir houses with them upon chariots, as men do tents or pavilions.  And\r\nthey make their fire in the midst of their houses.\r\n\r\nAnd they have great multitude of all manner of beasts, save only of\r\nswine, for they bring none forth.  And they believe well one God that\r\nmade and formed all things.  And natheles yet have they idols of gold and\r\nsilver, and of tree and of cloth.  And to those idols they offer always\r\ntheir first milk of their beasts, and also of their meats and of their\r\ndrinks before they eat.  And they offer often-times horses and beasts.\r\nAnd they clepe the God of kind _Yroga_.\r\n\r\nAnd their emperor also, what name that ever he have, they put evermore\r\nthereto, Chan.  And when I was there, their emperor had to name Thiaut,\r\nso that he was clept Thiaut-Chan.  And his eldest son was clept Tossue;\r\nand when he shall be emperor, he shall be clept Tossue-Chan.  And at that\r\ntime the emperor had twelve sons without him, that were named Cuncy,\r\nOrdii, Chadahay, Buryn, Negu, Nocab, Cadu, [Siban], Cuten, Balacy,\r\nBabylan, and Garegan.  And of his three wives, the first and principal,\r\nthat was Prester John’s daughter, had to name Serioche-Chan, and the\r\ntother Borak-Chan, and the tother Karanke-Chan.\r\n\r\nThe folk of that country begin all their things in the new moon, and they\r\nworship much the moon and the sun and often-time kneel against them.  And\r\nall the folk of the country ride commonly without spurs, but they bear\r\nalways a little whip in their hands for to chace with their horses.\r\n\r\nAnd they have great conscience and hold it for a great sin to cast a\r\nknife in the fire, and for to draw flesh out of a pot with a knife, and\r\nfor to smite an horse with the handle of a whip, or to smite an horse\r\nwith a bridle, or to break one bone with another, or for to cast milk or\r\nany liquor that men may drink upon the earth, or for to take and slay\r\nlittle children.  And the most sin that any man may do is to piss in\r\ntheir houses that they dwell in, and whoso that may be found with that\r\nsin sikerly they slay him.  And of everych of these sins it behoveth them\r\nto be shriven of their priests, and to pay great sum of silver for their\r\npenance.  And it behoveth also, that the place that men have pissed in be\r\nhallowed again, and else dare no man enter therein.  And when they have\r\npaid their penance, men make them pass through a fire or through two, for\r\nto cleanse them of their sins.  And also when any messenger cometh and\r\nbringeth letters or any present to the emperor, it behoveth him that he,\r\nwith the thing that he bringeth, pass through two burning fires for to\r\npurge them, that he bring no poison ne venom, ne no wicked thing that\r\nmight be grievance to the Lord.  And also if any man or woman be taken in\r\navoutry or fornication, anon they slay him.  And who that stealeth\r\nanything, anon they slay him.\r\n\r\nMen of that country be all good archers and shoot right well, both men\r\nand women, as well on horse-back, pricking, as on foot, running.  And the\r\nwomen make all things and all manner mysteries and crafts, as of clothes,\r\nboots and other things; and they drive carts, ploughs and wains and\r\nchariots; and they make houses and all manner mysteres, out taken bows\r\nand arrows and armours that men make.  And all the women wear breeches,\r\nas well as men.\r\n\r\nAll the folk of that country be full obeissant to their sovereigns; ne\r\nthey fight not, ne chide not one with another.  And there be neither\r\nthieves ne robbers in that country.  And every man worshippeth other; but\r\nno man there doth no reverence to no strangers, but if they be great\r\nprinces.\r\n\r\nAnd they eat hounds, lions, leopards, mares and foals, asses, rats and\r\nmice and all manner of beasts, great and small, save only swine and\r\nbeasts that were defended by the old law.  And they eat all the beasts\r\nwithout and within, without casting away of anything, save only the\r\nfilth.  And they eat but little bread, but if it be in courts of great\r\nlords.  And they have not in many places, neither pease ne beans ne none\r\nother pottages but the broth of the flesh.  For little eat they anything\r\nbut flesh and the broth.  And when they have eaten, they wipe their hands\r\nupon their skirts; for they use no napery ne towels, but if it be before\r\ngreat lords; but the common people hath none.  And when they have eaten,\r\nthey put their dishes unwashen into the pot or cauldron with remnant of\r\nthe flesh and of the broth till they will eat again.  And the rich men\r\ndrink milk of mares or of camels or of asses or of other beasts.  And\r\nthey will be lightly drunken of milk and of another drink that is made of\r\nhoney and of water sodden together; for in that country is neither wine\r\nne ale.  They live full wretchedly, and they eat but once in the day, and\r\nthat but little, neither in courts ne in other places.  And in sooth, one\r\nman alone in this country will eat more in a day than one of them will\r\neat in three days.  And if any strange messenger come there to a lord,\r\nmen make him to eat but once a day, and that full little.\r\n\r\nAnd when they war, they war full wisely and always do their business, to\r\ndestroy their enemies.  Every man there beareth two bows or three, and of\r\narrows great plenty, and a great axe.  And the gentles have short spears\r\nand large and full trenchant on that one side.  And they have plates and\r\nhelms made of quyrboylle, and their horses covertures of the same.  And\r\nwhoso fleeth from the battle they slay him.  And when they hold any siege\r\nabout castle or town that is walled and defensible, they behote to them\r\nthat be within to do all the profit and good, that it is marvel to hear;\r\nand they grant also to them that be within all that they will ask them.\r\nAnd after that they be yielden, anon they slay them all; and cut off\r\ntheir ears and souse them in vinegar, and thereof they make great service\r\nfor lords.  All their lust and all their imagination is for to put all\r\nlands under their subjection.  And they say that they know well by their\r\nprophecies, that they shall be overcome by archers and by strength of\r\nthem; but they know not of what nation ne of what law they shall be of,\r\nthat shall overcome them.  And therefore they suffer that folk of all\r\nlaws may peaceably dwell amongst them.\r\n\r\nAlso when they will make their idols or an image of any of their friends\r\nfor to have remembrance of him, they make always the image all naked\r\nwithout any manner of clothing.  For they say that in good love should be\r\nno covering, that man should not love for the fair clothing ne for the\r\nrich array, but only for the body, such as God hath made it, and for the\r\ngood virtues that the body is endowed with of Nature, not only for fair\r\nclothing that is not of kindly Nature.\r\n\r\nAnd ye shall understand that it is great dread for to pursue the Tartars\r\nif they flee in battle.  For in fleeing they shoot behind them and slay\r\nboth men and horses.  And when they will fight they will shock them\r\ntogether in a plump; that if there be 20,000 men, men shall not ween that\r\nthere be scant 10,000.  And they can well win land of strangers, but they\r\ncannot keep it; for they have greater lust to lie in tents without than\r\nfor to lie in castle or in towns.  And they prize nothing the wit of\r\nother nations.\r\n\r\nAnd amongst them oil of olive is full dear, for they hold it for full\r\nnoble medicine.  And all the Tartars have small eyen and little of beard,\r\nand not thick haired but shear.  And they be false and traitors; and they\r\nlast nought that they behote.  They be full hardy folk, and much pain and\r\nwoe may suffer and disease, more than any other folk, for they be taught\r\nthereto in their own country of youth.  And therefore they spend as who\r\nsaith, right nought.\r\n\r\nAnd when any man shall die, men set a spear beside him.  And when he\r\ndraweth towards the death, every man fleeth out of the house till he be\r\ndead.  And after that they bury him in the fields.\r\n\r\nAnd when the emperor dieth, men set him in a chair in midst the place of\r\nhis tent.  And men set a table before him clean, covered with a cloth,\r\nand thereupon flesh and diverse viands and a cup full of mare’s milk.\r\nAnd men put a mare beside him with her foal, and an horse saddled and\r\nbridled.  And they lay upon the horse gold and silver, great quantity.\r\nAnd they put about him great plenty of straw.  And then men make a great\r\npit and a large, and with the tent and all these other things they put\r\nhim in earth.  And they say that when he shall come into another world,\r\nhe shall not be without an house, ne without horse, ne without gold and\r\nsilver; and the mare shall give him milk, and bring him forth more horses\r\ntill he be well stored in the tother world.  For they trow that after\r\ntheir death they shall be eating and drinking in that other world, and\r\nsolacing them with their wives, as they did here.\r\n\r\nAnd after time that the emperor is thus interred no man shall be so hardy\r\nto speak of him before his friends.  And yet natheles, sometime falleth\r\nof many that they make him to be interred privily by night in wild\r\nplaces, and put again the grass over the pit for to grow; or else men\r\ncover the pit with gravel and sand, that no man shall perceive where, ne\r\nknow where, the pit is, to that intent that never after none of his\r\nfriends shall have mind ne remembrance of him.  And then they say that he\r\nis ravished into another world, where he is a greater lord than he was\r\nhere.\r\n\r\nAnd then, after the death of the emperor, the seven lineages assemble\r\nthem together, and choose his eldest son, or the next after him of his\r\nblood.  And thus they say to him; we will and we pray and ordain that ye\r\nbe our lord and our emperor.\r\n\r\nAnd then he answereth, If ye will that I reign over you as lord, do\r\neverych of you that I shall command him, either to abide or to go; and\r\nwhomsoever that I command to be slain, that anon he be slain.\r\n\r\nAnd they answer all with one voice, Whatsoever ye command, it shall be\r\ndone.\r\n\r\nThen saith the emperor, Now understand well, that my word from henceforth\r\nis sharp and biting as a sword.\r\n\r\nAfter, men set him upon a black steed and so men bring him to a chair\r\nfull richly arrayed, and there they crown him.  And then all the cities\r\nand good towns send him rich presents.  So that at that journey he shall\r\nhave more than sixty chariots charged with gold silver, without jewels of\r\ngold and precious stones, that lords gave him, that be without\r\nestimation, and without horses, and cloths of gold, and of camakas, and\r\ntartarins that be without number.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVII\r\n\r\n\r\n_Of the Realm of Tharse and the Lands and Kingdoms towards the\r\nSeptentrional Parts_, _in coming down from the land of Cathay_\r\n\r\nTHIS land of Cathay is in Asia the deep; and after, on this half, is Asia\r\nthe more.  The kingdom of Cathay marcheth toward the west unto the\r\nkingdom of Tharse, the which was one of the kings that came to present\r\nour Lord in Bethlehem.  And they that be of the lineage of that king are\r\nsome Christian.  In Tharse they eat no flesh, ne they drink no wine.\r\n\r\nAnd on this half, toward the west, is the kingdom of Turkestan, that\r\nstretcheth him toward the west to the kingdom of Persia, and toward the\r\nseptentrional to the kingdom of Khorasan.  In the country of Turkestan be\r\nbut few good cities; but the best city of that land hight Octorar.  There\r\nbe great pastures, but few corns; and therefore, for the most part, they\r\nbe all herdsmen, and they lie in tents and they drink a manner ale made\r\nof honey.\r\n\r\nAnd after, on this half, is the kingdom of Khorasan, that is a good land\r\nand a plenteous, without wine.  And it hath a desert toward the east that\r\nlasteth more than an hundred journeys.  And the best city of that country\r\nis clept Khorasan, and of that city beareth the country his name.  The\r\nfolk of that country be hardy warriors.\r\n\r\nAnd on this half is the kingdom of Comania, whereof the Comanians that\r\ndwelled in Greece sometime were chased out.  This is one of the greatest\r\nkingdoms of the world, but it is not all inhabited.  For at one of the\r\nparts there is so great cold that no man may dwell there; and in another\r\npart there is so great heat that no man may endure it, and also there be\r\nso many flies, that no man may know on what side he may turn him.  In\r\nthat country is but little arboury ne trees that bear fruit ne other.\r\nThey lie in tents; and they burn the dung of beasts for default of wood.\r\nThis kingdom descendeth on this half toward us and toward Prussia and\r\ntoward Russia.\r\n\r\nAnd through that country runneth the river of Ethille that is one of the\r\ngreatest rivers of the world.  And it freezeth so strongly all years that\r\nmany times men have fought upon the ice with great hosts, both parties on\r\nfoot, and their horses voided for the time, and what on horse and on\r\nfoot, more than 200,000 persons on every side.\r\n\r\nAnd between that river and the great sea Ocean, that they clepe the Sea\r\nMaure, lie all these realms.  And toward the head, beneath, in that realm\r\nis the Mount Chotaz, that is the highest mount of the world, and it is\r\nbetween the Sea Maure and the Sea Caspian.  There is full strait and\r\ndangerous passage for to go toward Ind.  And therefore King Alexander let\r\nmake there a strong city, that men clepe Alexandria, for to keep the\r\ncountry that no man should pass without his leave.  And now men clepe\r\nthat city, the Gate of Hell.\r\n\r\nAnd the principal city of Comania is clept Sarak, that is one of the\r\nthree ways for to go into Ind.  But by that way, ne may not pass no great\r\nmultitude of people, but if it be in winter.  And that passage men clepe\r\nthe Derbent.  The tother way is for to go from the city of Turkestan by\r\nPersia, and by that way be many journeys by desert.  And the third way is\r\nthat cometh from Comania and then to go by the Great Sea and by the\r\nkingdom of Abchaz.\r\n\r\nAnd ye shall understand, that all these kingdoms and all these lands\r\nabove-said unto Prussia and to Russia be all obeissant to the great Chan\r\nof Cathay, and many other countries that march to other coasts.\r\nWherefore his power and his lordship is full great and full mighty.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVIII\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Emperor of Persia_, _and of the Land of Darkness_; _and of other\r\nkingdoms that belong to the great Chan of Cathay_, _and other lands of\r\nhis_, _unto the sea of Greece_\r\n\r\nNOW, since I have devised you the lands and the kingdoms toward the parts\r\nSeptentrionals in coming down from the land of Cathay unto the lands of\r\nthe Christian, towards Prussia and Russia,—now shall I devise you of\r\nother lands and kingdoms coming down by other coasts, toward the right\r\nside, unto the sea of Greece, toward the land of Christian men.  And,\r\ntherefore, that after Ind and after Cathay the Emperor of Persia is the\r\ngreatest lord, therefore, I shall tell you of the kingdom of Persia.\r\n\r\nFirst, where he hath two kingdoms, the first kingdom beginneth toward the\r\neast, toward the kingdom of Turkestan, and it stretcheth toward the west\r\nunto the river of Pison, that is one of the four rivers that come out of\r\nParadise.  And on another side it stretcheth toward the Septentrion unto\r\nthe sea of Caspian; and also toward the south unto the desert of Ind.\r\nAnd this country is good and plain and full of people.  And there be many\r\ngood cities.  But the two principal cities be these, Boyturra, and\r\nSeornergant, that some men clepe Sormagant.  The tother kingdom of Persia\r\nstretcheth toward the river of Pison and the parts of the west unto the\r\nkingdom of Media, and from the great Armenia and toward the Septentrion\r\nto the sea of Caspian and toward the south to the land of Ind.  That is\r\nalso a good land and a plenteous, and it hath three great principal\r\ncities—Messabor, Saphon, and Sarmassan.\r\n\r\nAnd then after is Armenia, in the which were wont to be four kingdoms;\r\nthat is a noble country and full of goods.  And it beginneth at Persia\r\nand stretcheth toward the west in length unto Turkey.  And in largeness\r\nit dureth to the city of Alexandria, that now is clept the Gate of Hell,\r\nthat I spake of before, under the kingdom of Media.  In this Armenia be\r\nfull many good cities, but Taurizo is most of name.\r\n\r\nAfter this is the kingdom of Media, that is full long, but it is not full\r\nlarge, that beginneth toward the east to the land of Persia and to Ind\r\nthe less; and it stretcheth toward the west, toward the kingdom of\r\nChaldea and toward the Septentrion, descending toward the little Armenia.\r\nIn that kingdom of Media there be many great hills and little of plain\r\nearth.  There dwell Saracens and another manner of folk, that men clepe\r\nCordynes.  The best two cities of that kingdom be Sarras and Karemen.\r\n\r\nAfter that is the kingdom of Georgia, that beginneth toward the east to\r\nthe great mountain that is clept Abzor, where that dwell many diverse\r\nfolk of diverse nations.  And men clepe the country Alamo.  This kingdom\r\nstretcheth him towards Turkey and toward the Great Sea, and toward the\r\nsouth it marcheth to the great Armenia.  And there be two kingdoms in\r\nthat country; that one is the kingdom of Georgia, and that other is the\r\nkingdom of Abchaz.  And always in that country be two kings; and they be\r\nboth Christian.  But the king of Georgia is in subjection to the great\r\nChan.  And the king of Abchaz hath the more strong country, and he always\r\nvigorously defendeth his country against all those that assail him, so\r\nthat no man may make him in subjection to no man.\r\n\r\nIn that kingdom of Abchaz is a great marvel.  For a province of the\r\ncountry that hath well in circuit three journeys, that men clepe Hanyson,\r\nis all covered with darkness, without any brightness or light; so that no\r\nman may see ne hear, ne no man dare enter into him.  And, natheles, they\r\nof the country say, that some-times men hear voice of folk, and horses\r\nneighing, and cocks crowing.  And men wit well, that men dwell there, but\r\nthey know not what men.  And they say, that the darkness befell by\r\nmiracle of God.  For a cursed emperor of Persia, that hight Saures,\r\npursued all Christian men to destroy them and to compel them to make\r\nsacrifice to his idols, and rode with great host, in all that ever he\r\nmight, for to confound the Christian men.  And then in that country\r\ndwelled many good Christian men, the which that left their goods and\r\nwould have fled into Greece.  And when they were in a plain that hight\r\nMegon, anon this cursed emperor met with them with his host for to have\r\nslain them and hewn them to pieces.  And anon the Christian men kneeled\r\nto the ground, and made their prayers to God to succour them.  And anon a\r\ngreat thick cloud came and covered the emperor and all his host.  And so\r\nthey endure in that manner that they ne may not go out on no side; and so\r\nshall they evermore abide in that darkness till the day of doom, by the\r\nmiracle of God.  And then the Christian men went where them liked best,\r\nat their own pleasance, without letting of any creature, and their\r\nenemies enclosed and confounded in darkness, without any stroke.\r\n\r\nWherefore we may well say with David, _A Domino factum est istud_; _& est\r\nmirabile in oculis nostris_.  And that was a great miracle, that God made\r\nfor them.  Wherefore methinketh that Christian men should be more devout\r\nto serve our Lord God than any other men of any other sect.  For without\r\nany dread, ne were not cursedness and sin of Christian men, they should\r\nbe lords of all the world.  For the banner of Jesu Christ is always\r\ndisplayed, and ready on all sides to the help of his true loving\r\nservants.  Insomuch, that one good Christian man in good belief should\r\novercome and out-chase a thousand cursed misbelieving men, as David saith\r\nin the Psalter, _Quoniam persequebatur unus mills_, _& duo fugarent decem\r\nmilia_; _et cadent a latere tuo mille_, _& decem milia a dextris tuis_.\r\nAnd how that it might be that one should chase a thousand, David himself\r\nsaith following, _Quia manus Domini fecit haec omnia_, and our Lord\r\nhimself saith, by the prophet’s mouth, _Si in viis meis ambulaveritis_,\r\n_super tribulantes vos misissem manum meam_.  So that we may see apertly\r\nthat if we will be good men, no enemy may not endure against us.\r\n\r\nAlso ye shall understand that out of that land of darkness goeth out a\r\ngreat river that sheweth well that there be folk dwelling, by many ready\r\ntokens; but no man dare not enter into it.\r\n\r\nAnd wit well, that in the kingdoms of Georgia, of Abchaz and of the\r\nlittle Armenia be good Christian men and devout.  For they shrive them\r\nand housel them evermore once or twice in the week.  And there be many of\r\nthem that housel them every day; and so do we not on this half, albeit\r\nthat Saint Paul commandeth it, saying, _Omnibus diebus dominicis ad\r\ncommunicandum hortor_.  They keep that commandment, but we ne keep it\r\nnot.\r\n\r\nAlso after, on this half, is Turkey, that marcheth to the great Armenia.\r\nAnd there be many provinces, as Cappadocia, Saure, Brique, Quesiton,\r\nPytan, and Gemethe.  And in everych of these be many good cities.  This\r\nTurkey stretcheth unto the city of Sachala that sitteth upon the sea of\r\nGreece, and so it marcheth to Syria.  Syria is a great country and a\r\ngood, as I have told you before.  And also it hath, above toward Ind, the\r\nkingdom of Chaldea, that stretcheth from the mountains of Chaldea toward\r\nthe east unto the city of Nineveh, that sitteth upon the river of Tigris;\r\nand in largeness it beginneth toward the north to the city of Maraga; and\r\nit stretcheth toward the south unto the sea Ocean.  In Chaldea is a plain\r\ncountry, and few hills and few rivers.\r\n\r\nAfter is the kingdom of Mesopotamia, that beginneth, toward the east, to\r\nthe flom of Tigris, unto a city that is clept Mosul; and it stretcheth\r\ntoward the west to the flom of Euphrates unto a city that is clept\r\nRoianz; and in length it goeth to the mount of Armenia unto the desert of\r\nInd the less.  This is a good country and a plain, but it hath few\r\nrivers.  It hath but two mountains in that country, of the which one\r\nhight Symar and that other Lyson.  And this land marcheth to the kingdom\r\nof Chaldea.\r\n\r\nYet there is, toward the parts Meridionals many countries and many\r\nregions, as the land of Ethiopia, that marcheth, toward the east to the\r\ngreat deserts, toward the west to the kingdom of Nubia, toward the south\r\nto the kingdom of Moretane, and toward the north to the Red Sea.\r\n\r\nAfter is Moretane, that dureth from the mountains of Ethiopia unto Lybia\r\nthe high.  And that country lieth along from the sea ocean toward the\r\nsouth; and toward the north it marcheth to Nubia and to the high Lybia.\r\n(These men of Nubia be Christian.)  And it marcheth from the lands\r\nabove-said to the deserts of Egypt, and that is the Egypt that I have\r\nspoken of before.\r\n\r\nAnd after is Lybia the high and Lybia the low, that descendeth down low\r\ntoward the great sea of Spain, in the which country be many kingdoms and\r\nmany diverse folk.\r\n\r\nNow I have devised you many countries on this half the kingdom of Cathay,\r\nof the which many be obeissant to the great Chan.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIX\r\n\r\n\r\n_Of the Countries and Isles that be beyond the Land of Cathay_; _and of\r\nthe fruits there_; _and of twenty-two kings enclosed within the\r\nmountains_\r\n\r\nNOW shall I say you, suingly, of countries and isles that be beyond the\r\ncountries that I have spoken of.\r\n\r\nWherefore I say you, in passing by the land of Cathay toward the high Ind\r\nand toward Bacharia, men pass by a kingdom that men clepe Caldilhe, that\r\nis a full fair country.\r\n\r\nAnd there groweth a manner of fruit, as though it were gourds.  And when\r\nthey be ripe, men cut them a-two, and men find within a little beast, in\r\nflesh, in bone, and blood, as though it were a little lamb without wool.\r\nAnd men eat both the fruit and the beast.  And that is a great marvel.\r\nOf that fruit I have eaten, although it were wonderful, but that I know\r\nwell that God is marvellous in his works.  And, natheles, I told them of\r\nas great a marvel to them, that is amongst us, and that was of the\r\nBernakes.  For I told them that in our country were trees that bear a\r\nfruit that become birds flying, and those that fell in the water live,\r\nand they that fall on the earth die anon, and they be right good to man’s\r\nmeat.  And hereof had they as great marvel, that some of them trowed it\r\nwere an impossible thing to be.\r\n\r\nIn that country be long apples of good savour, whereof be more than an\r\nhundred in a cluster, and as many in another; and they have great long\r\nleaves and large, of two foot long or more.  And in that country, and in\r\nother countries thereabout, grow many trees that bear clove-gylofres and\r\nnutmegs, and great nuts of Ind, and of Canell and of many other spices.\r\nAnd there be vines that bear so great grapes, that a strong man should\r\nhave enough to do for to bear one cluster with all the grapes.\r\n\r\nIn that same region be the mountains of Caspian that men clepe Uber in\r\nthe country.  Between those mountains the Jews of ten lineages be\r\nenclosed, that men clepe Goth and Magoth and they may not go out on no\r\nside.  There were enclosed twenty-two kings with their people, that\r\ndwelled between the mountains of Scythia.  There King Alexander chased\r\nthem between those mountains, and there he thought for to enclose them\r\nthrough work of his men.  But when he saw that he might not do it, ne\r\nbring it to an end, he prayed to God of nature that he would perform that\r\nthat he had begun.  And all were it so, that he was a paynim and not\r\nworthy to be heard, yet God of his grace closed the mountains together,\r\nso that they dwell there all fast locked and enclosed with high mountains\r\nall about, save only on one side, and on that side is the sea of Caspian.\r\n\r\nNow may some men ask, since that the sea is on that one side, wherefore\r\ngo they not out on the sea side, for to go where that them liketh?\r\n\r\nBut to this question, I shall answer; that sea of Caspian goeth out by\r\nland under the mountains, and runneth by the desert at one side of the\r\ncountry, and after it stretcheth unto the ends of Persia, and although it\r\nbe clept a sea, it is no sea, ne it toucheth to none other sea, but it is\r\na lake, the greatest of the world; and though they would put them into\r\nthat sea, they ne wist never where that they should arrive; and also they\r\ncan no language but only their own, that no man knoweth but they; and\r\ntherefore may they not go out.\r\n\r\nAnd also ye shall understand, that the Jews have no proper land of their\r\nown for to dwell in, in all the world, but only that land between the\r\nmountains.  And yet they yield tribute for that land to the Queen of\r\nAmazonia, the which that maketh them to be kept in close full diligently,\r\nthat they shall not go out on no side but by the coast of their land; for\r\ntheir land marcheth to those mountains.\r\n\r\nAnd often it hath befallen, that some of the Jews have gone up the\r\nmountains and avaled down to the valleys.  But great number of folk ne\r\nmay not do so, for the mountains be so high and so straight up, that they\r\nmust abide there, maugre their might.  For they may not go out, but by a\r\nlittle issue that was made by strength of men, and it lasteth well a four\r\ngreat mile.\r\n\r\nAnd after, is there yet a land all desert, where men may find no water,\r\nneither for digging ne for none other thing.  Wherefore men may not dwell\r\nin that place, so is it full of dragons, of serpents and of other\r\nvenomous beasts, that no man dare not pass, but if it be strong winter.\r\nAnd that strait passage men clepe in that country Clyron.  And that is\r\nthe passage that the Queen of Amazonia maketh to be kept.  And though it\r\nhappen some of them by fortune to go out, they can no manner of language\r\nbut Hebrew, so that they cannot speak to the people.\r\n\r\nAnd yet, natheles, men say they shall go out in the time of anti-Christ,\r\nand that they shall make great slaughter of Christian men.  And therefore\r\nall the Jews that dwell in all lands learn always to speak Hebrew, in\r\nhope, that when the other Jews shall go out, that they may understand\r\ntheir speech, and to lead them into Christendom for to destroy the\r\nChristian people.  For the Jews say that they know well by their\r\nprophecies, that they of Caspia shall go out, and spread throughout all\r\nthe world, and that the Christian men shall be under their subjection, as\r\nlong as they have been in subjection of them.\r\n\r\nAnd if that you will wit how that they shall find their way, after that I\r\nhave heard say I shall tell you.\r\n\r\nIn the time of anti-Christ a fox shall make there his train, and mine an\r\nhole where King Alexander let make the gates; and so long he shall mine\r\nand pierce the earth, till that he shall pass through towards that folk.\r\nAnd when they see the fox, they shall have great marvel of him, because\r\nthat they saw never such a beast.  For of all other beasts they have\r\nenclosed amongst them, save only the fox.  And then they shall chase him\r\nand pursue him so strait, till that he come to the same place that he\r\ncame from.  And then they shall dig and mine so strongly, till that they\r\nfind the gates that King Alexander let make of great stones, and passing\r\nhuge, well cemented and made strong for the mastery.  And those gates\r\nthey shall break, and so go out by finding of that issue.\r\n\r\nFrom that land go men toward the land of Bacharia, where be full evil\r\nfolk and full cruel.  In that land be trees that bear wool, as though it\r\nwere of sheep, whereof men make clothes and all things that may be made\r\nof wool.\r\n\r\nIn that country be many hippotaynes that dwell some-time in the water and\r\nsometime on the land.  And they be half man and half horse, as I have\r\nsaid before.  And they eat men when they may take them.\r\n\r\nAnd there be rivers of waters that be full bitter, three sithes more than\r\nis the water of the sea.\r\n\r\nIn that country be many griffins, more plenty than in any other country.\r\nSome men say that they have the body upward as an eagle and beneath as a\r\nlion; and truly they say sooth, that they be of that shape.  But one\r\ngriffin hath the body more great and is more strong than eight lions, of\r\nsuch lions as be on this half, and more great and stronger than an\r\nhundred eagles such as we have amongst us.  For one griffin there will\r\nbear, flying to his nest, a great horse, if he may find him at the point,\r\nor two oxen yoked together as they go at the plough.  For he hath his\r\ntalons so long and so large and great upon his feet, as though they were\r\nhorns of great oxen or of bugles or of kine, so that men make cups of\r\nthem to drink of.  And of their ribs and of the pens of their wings, men\r\nmake bows, full strong, to shoot with arrows and quarrels.\r\n\r\nFrom thence go men by many journeys through the land of Prester John, the\r\ngreat Emperor of Ind.  And men clepe his realm the isle of Pentexoire.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXX\r\n\r\n\r\n_Of the Royal Estate of Prester John_.  _And of a rich man that made a\r\nmarvellous castle and cleped it Paradise_; _and of his subtlety_\r\n\r\nTHIS emperor, Prester John, holds full great land, and hath many full\r\nnoble cities and good towns in his realm, and many great diverse isles\r\nand large.  For all the country of Ind is devised in isles for the great\r\nfloods that come from Paradise, that depart all the land in many parts.\r\nAnd also in the sea he hath full many isles.  And the best city in the\r\nIsle of Pentexoire is Nyse, that is a full royal city and a noble, and\r\nfull rich.\r\n\r\nThis Prester John hath under him many kings and many isles and many\r\ndiverse folk of diverse conditions.  And this land is full good and rich,\r\nbut not so rich as is the land of the great Chan.  For the merchants come\r\nnot thither so commonly for to buy merchandises, as they do in the land\r\nof the great Chan, for it is too far to travel to.  And on that other\r\npart, in the Isle of Cathay, men find all manner thing that is need to\r\nman—cloths of gold, of silk, of spicery and all manner avoirdupois.  And\r\ntherefore, albeit that men have greater cheap in the Isle of Prester\r\nJohn, natheles, men dread the long way and the great perils in the sea in\r\nthose parts.\r\n\r\nFor in many places of the sea be great rocks of stones of the adamant,\r\nthat of his proper nature draweth iron to him.  And therefore there pass\r\nno ships that have either bonds or nails of iron within them.  And if\r\nthere do, anon the rocks of the adamants draw them to them, that never\r\nthey may go thence.  I myself have seen afar in that sea, as though it\r\nhad been a great isle full of tree, and buscaylle, full of thorns and\r\nbriars, great plenty.  And the shipmen told us, that all that was of\r\nships that were drawn thither by the adamants, for the iron that was in\r\nthem.  And of the rotten-ness, and other thing that was within the ships,\r\ngrew such buscaylle, and thorns and briars and green grass, and such\r\nmanner of thing; and of the masts and the sail-yards; it seemed a great\r\nwood or a grove.  And such rocks be in many places thereabout.  And\r\ntherefore dare not the merchants pass there, but if they know well the\r\npassages, or else that they have good lodesmen.\r\n\r\nAnd also they dread the long way.  And therefore they go to Cathay, for\r\nit is more nigh.  And yet it is not so nigh, but that men must be\r\ntravelling by sea and land, eleven months or twelve, from Genoa or from\r\nVenice, or he come to Cathay.  And yet is the land of Prester John more\r\nfar by many dreadful journeys.\r\n\r\nAnd the merchants pass by the kingdom of Persia, and go to a city that is\r\nClept Hermes, for Hermes the philosopher founded it.  And after that they\r\npass an arm of the sea, and then they go to another city that is clept\r\nGolbache.  And there they find merchandises, and of popinjays, as great\r\nplenty as men find here of geese.  And if they will pass further, they\r\nmay go sikerly enough.  In that country is but little wheat or barley,\r\nand therefore they eat rice and honey and milk and cheese and fruit.\r\n\r\nThis Emperor Prester John taketh always to his wife the daughter of the\r\ngreat Chan; and the great Chan also, in the same wise, the daughter of\r\nPrester John.  For these two be the greatest lords under the firmament.\r\n\r\nIn the land of Prester John be many diverse things and many precious\r\nstones, so great and so large, that men make of them vessels, as\r\nplatters, dishes and cups.  And many other marvels be there, that it were\r\ntoo cumbrous and too long to put it in scripture of books; but of the\r\nprincipal isles and of his estate and of his law, I shall tell you some\r\npart.\r\n\r\nThis Emperor Prester John is Christian, and a great part of his country\r\nalso.  But yet, they have not all the articles of our faith as we have.\r\nThey believe well in the Father, in the Son and in the Holy Ghost.  And\r\nthey be full devout and right true one to another.  And they set not by\r\nno barretts, ne by cautels, nor of no deceits.\r\n\r\nAnd he hath under him seventy-two provinces, and in every province is a\r\nking.  And these kings have kings under them, and all be tributaries to\r\nPrester John.  And he hath in his lordships many great marvels.\r\n\r\nFor in his country is the sea that men clepe the Gravelly Sea, that is\r\nall gravel and sand, without any drop of water, and it ebbeth and floweth\r\nin great waves as other seas do, and it is never still ne in peace, in no\r\nmanner season.  And no man may pass that sea by navy, ne by no manner of\r\ncraft, and therefore may no man know what land is beyond that sea.  And\r\nalbeit that it have no water, yet men find therein and on the banks full\r\ngood fish of other manner of kind and shape, than men find in any other\r\nsea, and they be of right good taste and delicious to man’s meat.\r\n\r\nAnd a three journeys long from that sea be great mountains, out of the\r\nwhich goeth out a great flood that cometh out of Paradise.  And it is\r\nfull of precious stones, without any drop of water, and it runneth\r\nthrough the desert on that one side, so that it maketh the sea gravelly;\r\nand it beareth into that sea, and there it endeth.  And that flome\r\nrunneth, also, three days in the week and bringeth with him great stones\r\nand the rocks also therewith, and that great plenty.  And anon, as they\r\nbe entered into the Gravelly Sea, they be seen no more, but lost for\r\nevermore.  And in those three days that that river runneth, no man dare\r\nenter into it; but in the other days men dare enter well enough.\r\n\r\nAlso beyond that flome, more upward to the deserts, is a great plain all\r\ngravelly, between the mountains.  And in that plain, every day at the\r\nsun-rising, begin to grow small trees, and they grow till mid-day,\r\nbearing fruit; but no man dare take of that fruit, for it is a thing of\r\nfaerie.  And after mid-day, they decrease and enter again into the earth,\r\nso that at the going down of the sun they appear no more.  And so they\r\ndo, every day.  And that is a great marvel.\r\n\r\nIn that desert be many wild men, that be hideous to look on; for they be\r\nhorned, and they speak nought, but they grunt, as pigs.  And there is\r\nalso great plenty of wild hounds.  And there be many popinjays, that they\r\nclepe psittakes their language.  And they speak of their proper nature,\r\nand salute men that go through the deserts, and speak to them as apertly\r\nas though it were a man.  And they that speak well have a large tongue,\r\nand have five toes upon a foot.  And there be also of another manner,\r\nthat have but three toes upon a foot, and they speak not, or but little,\r\nfor they can not but cry.\r\n\r\nThis Emperor Prester John when he goeth into battle against any other\r\nlord, he hath no banners borne before him; but he hath three crosses of\r\ngold, fine, great and high, full of precious stones, and every of those\r\ncrosses be set in a chariot, full richly arrayed.  And for to keep every\r\ncross, be ordained 10,000 men of arms and more than 100,000 men on foot,\r\nin manner as men would keep a standard in our countries, when that we be\r\nin land of war.  And this number of folk is without the principal host\r\nand without wings ordained for the battle.  And when he hath no war, but\r\nrideth with a privy meinie, then he hath borne before him but one cross\r\nof tree, without painting and without gold or silver or precious stones,\r\nin remembrance that Jesu Christ suffered death upon a cross of tree.  And\r\nhe hath borne before him also a platter of gold full of earth, in token\r\nthat his noblesse and his might and his flesh shall turn to earth.  And\r\nhe hath borne before him also a vessel of silver, full of noble jewels of\r\ngold full rich and of precious stones, in token of his lordship and of\r\nhis noblesse and of his might.\r\n\r\nHe dwelleth commonly in the city of Susa.  And there is his principal\r\npalace, that is so rich and so noble, that no man will trow it by\r\nestimation, but he had seen it.  And above the chief tower of the palace\r\nbe two round pommels of gold, and in everych of them be two carbuncles\r\ngreat and large, that shine full bright upon the night.  And the\r\nprincipal gates of his palace be of precious stone that men clepe\r\nsardonyx, and the border and the bars be of ivory.  And the windows of\r\nthe halls and chambers be of crystal.  And the tables whereon men eat,\r\nsome be of emeralds, some of amethyst, and some of gold, full of precious\r\nstones; and the pillars that bear up the tables be of the same precious\r\nstones.  And the degrees to go up to his throne, where he sitteth at the\r\nmeat, one is of onyx, another is of crystal, and another of jasper green,\r\nanother of amethyst, another of sardine, another of cornelian, and the\r\nseventh, that he setteth on his feet, is of chrysolite.  And all these\r\ndegrees be bordered with fine gold, with the tother precious stones, set\r\nwith great pearls orient.  And the sides of the siege of his throne be of\r\nemeralds, and bordered with gold full nobly, and dubbed with other\r\nprecious stones and great pearls.  And all the pillars in his chamber be\r\nof fine gold with precious stones, and with many carbuncles, that give\r\ngreat light upon the night to all people.  And albeit that the carbuncles\r\ngive light right enough, natheles, at all times burneth a vessel of\r\ncrystal full of balm, for to give good smell and odour to the emperor,\r\nand to void away all wicked airs and corruptions.  And the form of his\r\nbed is of fine sapphires, bended with gold, for to make him sleep well\r\nand to refrain him from lechery; for he will not lie with his wives, but\r\nfour sithes in the year, after the four seasons, and that is only for to\r\nengender children.\r\n\r\nHe hath also a full fair palace and a noble at the city of Nyse, where\r\nthat he dwelleth, when him best liketh; but the air is not so attempre,\r\nas it is at the city of Susa.\r\n\r\nAnd ye shall understand, that in all his country nor in the countries\r\nthere all about, men eat not but once in the day, as they do in the court\r\nof the great Chan.  And so they eat every day in his court, more than\r\n30,000 persons, without goers and comers.  But the 30,000 persons of his\r\ncountry, ne of the country of the great Chan, ne spend not so much good\r\nas do 12,000 of our country.\r\n\r\nThis Emperor Prester John hath evermore seven kings with him to serve\r\nhim, and they depart their service by certain months.  And with these\r\nkings serve always seventy-two dukes and three hundred and sixty earls.\r\nAnd all the days of the year, there eat in his household and in his\r\ncourt, twelve archbishops and twenty bishops.  And the patriarch of Saint\r\nThomas is there as is the pope here.  And the archbishops and the bishops\r\nand the abbots in that country be all kings.  And everych of these great\r\nlords know well enough the attendance of their service.  The one is\r\nmaster of his household, another is his chamberlain, another serveth him\r\nof a dish, another of the cup, another is steward, another is marshal,\r\nanother is prince of his arms, and thus is he full nobly and royally\r\nserved.  And his land dureth in very breadth four month’s journeys, and\r\nin length out of measure, that is to say, all isles under earth that we\r\nsuppose to be under us.\r\n\r\nBeside the isle of Pentexoire, that is the land of Prester John, is a eat\r\nisle, long and broad, that men clepe Mistorak; and it is in the lordship\r\nof Prester John.  In that isle is great plenty of goods.\r\n\r\nThere was dwelling, sometime, a rich man; and it is not long since; and\r\nmen clept him Gatholonabes.  And he was full of cautels and of subtle\r\ndeceits.  And he had a full fair castle and a strong in a mountain, so\r\nstrong and so noble, that no man could devise a fairer ne stronger.  And\r\nhe had let mure all the mountain about with a strong wall and a fair.\r\nAnd within those walls he had the fairest garden that any man might\r\nbehold.  And therein were trees bearing all manner of fruits, that any\r\nman could devise.  And therein were also all manner virtuous herbs of\r\ngood smell, and all other herbs also that bear fair flowers.  And he had\r\nalso in that garden many fair wells; and beside those wells he had let\r\nmake fair halls and fair chambers, depainted all with gold and azure; and\r\nthere were in that place many diverse things, and many diverse stories:\r\nand of beasts, and of birds that sung full delectably and moved by craft,\r\nthat it seemed that they were quick.  And he had also in his garden all\r\nmanner of fowls and of beasts that any man might think on, for to have\r\nplay or sport to behold them.\r\n\r\nAnd he had also, in that place, the fairest damsels that might be found,\r\nunder the age of fifteen years, and the fairest young striplings that men\r\nmight get, of that same age.  And all they were clothed in cloths of\r\ngold, full richly.  And he said that those were angels.\r\n\r\nAnd he had also let make three wells, fair and noble and all environed\r\nwith stone of jasper, of crystal, diapered with gold, and set with\r\nprecious stones and great orient pearls.  And he had made a conduit under\r\nearth, so that the three wells, at his list, one should run milk, another\r\nwine and another honey.  And that place he clept Paradise.\r\n\r\nAnd when that any good knight, that was hardy and noble, came to see this\r\nroyalty, he would lead him into his paradise, and show him these\r\nwonderful things to his disport, and the marvellous and delicious song of\r\ndiverse birds, and the fair damsels, and the fair wells of milk, of wine\r\nand of honey, plenteously running.  And he would let make divers\r\ninstruments of music to sound in an high tower, so merrily, that it was\r\njoy for to hear; and no man should see the craft thereof.  And those, he\r\nsaid, were angels of God, and that place was Paradise, that God had\r\nbehight to his friends, saying, _Dabo vobis terram fluentem lacte et\r\nmelle_.  And then would he make them to drink of certain drink, whereof\r\nanon they should be drunk.  And then would them think greater delight\r\nthan they had before.  And then would he say to them, that if they would\r\ndie for him and for his love, that after their death they should come to\r\nhis paradise; and they should be of the age of those damosels, and they\r\nshould play with them, and yet be maidens.  And after that yet should he\r\nput them in a fairer paradise, where that they should see God of nature\r\nvisibly, in his majesty and in his bliss.  And then would he shew them\r\nhis intent, and say them, that if they would go slay such a lord, or such\r\na man that was his enemy or contrarious to his list, that they should not\r\ndread to do it and for to be slain therefore themselves.  For after their\r\ndeath, he would put them into another paradise, that was an hundred-fold\r\nfairer than any of the tother; and there should they dwell with the most\r\nfairest damosels that might be, and play with them ever-more.\r\n\r\nAnd thus went many diverse lusty bachelors for to slay great lords in\r\ndiverse countries, that were his enemies, and made themselves to be\r\nslain, in hope to have that paradise.  And thus, often-time, he was\r\nrevenged of his enemies by his subtle deceits and false cautels.\r\n\r\nAnd when the worthy men of the country had perceived this subtle\r\nfalsehood of this Gatholonabes, they assembled them with force, and\r\nassailed his castle, and slew him, and destroyed all the fair places and\r\nall the nobilities of that paradise.  The place of the wells and of the\r\nwalls and of many other things be yet apertly seen, but the riches is\r\nvoided clean.  And it is not long gone, since that place was destroyed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXI\r\n\r\n\r\n_Of the Devil’s Head in the Valley Perilous_.  _And of the Customs of\r\nFolk in diverse Isles that be about in the Lordship of Prester John_\r\n\r\nBESIDE that Isle of Mistorak upon the left side nigh to the river of\r\nPison is a marvellous thing.  There is a vale between the mountains, that\r\ndureth nigh a four mile.  And some men clepe it the Vale Enchanted, some\r\nclepe it the Vale of Devils, and some clepe it the Vale Perilous.  In\r\nthat vale hear men often-time great tempests and thunders, and great\r\nmurmurs and noises, all days and nights, and great noise, as it were\r\nsound of tabors and of nakers and of trumps, as though it were of a great\r\nfeast.  This vale is all full of devils, and hath been always.  And men\r\nsay there, that it is one of the entries of hell.  In that vale is great\r\nplenty of gold and silver.  Wherefore many misbelieving men, and many\r\nChristian men also, go in oftentime for to have of the treasure that\r\nthere is; but few come again, and namely of the misbelieving men, ne of\r\nthe Christian men neither, for anon they be strangled of devils.\r\n\r\nAnd in mid place of that vale, under a rock, is an head and the visage of\r\na devil bodily, full horrible and dreadful to see, and it sheweth not but\r\nthe head, to the shoulders.  But there is no man in the world so hardy,\r\nChristian man ne other, but that he would be adread to behold it, and\r\nthat it would seem him to die for dread, so is it hideous for to behold.\r\nFor he beholdeth every man so sharply with dreadful eyen, that be\r\nevermore moving and sparkling as fire, and changeth and stirreth so often\r\nin diverse manner, with so horrible countenance, that no man dare not\r\nneighen towards him.  And from him cometh out smoke and stinking fire and\r\nso much abomination, that unnethe no man may there endure.\r\n\r\nBut the good Christian men, that be stable in the faith, enter well\r\nwithout peril.  For they will first shrive them and mark them with the\r\ntoken of the holy cross, so that the fiends ne have no power over them.\r\nBut albeit that they be without peril, yet, natheles, ne be they not\r\nwithout dread, when that they see the devils visibly and bodily all about\r\nthem, that make full many diverse assaults and menaces, in air and in\r\nearth, and aghast them with strokes of thunder-blasts and of tempests.\r\nAnd the most dread is, that God will take vengeance then of that that men\r\nhave misdone against his will.\r\n\r\nAnd ye shall understand, that when my fellows and I were in that vale, we\r\nwere in great thought, whether that we durst put our bodies in adventure,\r\nto go in or not, in the protection of God.  And some of our fellows\r\naccorded to enter, and some not.  So there were with us two worthy men,\r\nfriars minors, that were of Lombardy, that said, that if any man would\r\nenter they would go in with us.  And when they had said so, upon the\r\ngracious trust of God and of them, we let sing mass, and made every man\r\nto be shriven and houseled.  And then we entered fourteen persons; but at\r\nour going out we were but nine.  And so we wist never, whether that our\r\nfellows were lost, or else turned again for dread.  But we saw them never\r\nafter; and those were two men of Greece, and three of Spain.  And our\r\nother fellows that would not go in with us, they went by another coast to\r\nbe before us; and so they were.\r\n\r\nAnd thus we passed that perilous vale, and found therein gold and silver,\r\nand precious stones and rich jewels, great plenty, both here and there,\r\nas us seemed.  But whether that it was, as us seemed, I wot never.  For I\r\ntouched none, because that the devils be so subtle to make a thing to\r\nseem otherwise than it is, for to deceive mankind.  And therefore I\r\ntouched none, and also because that I would not be put out of my\r\ndevotion; for I was more devout then, than ever I was before or after,\r\nand all for the dread of fiends that I saw in diverse figures, and also\r\nfor the great multitude of dead bodies, that I saw there lying by the\r\nway, by all the vale, as though there had been a battle between two\r\nkings, and the mightiest of the country, and that the greater part had\r\nbeen discomfited and slain.  And I trow, that unnethe should any country\r\nhave so much people within him, as lay slain in that vale as us thought,\r\nthe which was an hideous sight to see.  And I marvelled much, that there\r\nwere so many, and the bodies all whole without rotting.  But I trow, that\r\nfiends made them seem to be so whole without rotting.  But that might not\r\nbe to mine advice that so many should have entered so newly, ne so many\r\nnewly slain, with out stinking and rotting.  And many of them were in\r\nhabit of Christian men, but I trow well, that it were of such that went\r\nin for covetise of the treasure that was there, and had overmuch\r\nfeebleness in the faith; so that their hearts ne might not endure in the\r\nbelief for dread.  And therefore were we the more devout a great deal.\r\nAnd yet we were cast down, and beaten down many times to the hard earth\r\nby winds and thunders and tempests.  But evermore God of his grace holp\r\nus.  And so we passed that perilous vale without peril and without\r\nencumbrance, thanked be Almighty God.\r\n\r\nAfter this, beyond the vale, is a great isle, where the folk be great\r\ngiants of twenty-eight foot long, or of thirty foot long.  And they have\r\nno clothing but of skins of beasts that they hang upon them.  And they\r\neat no bread, but all raw flesh; and they drink milk of beasts, for they\r\nhave plenty of all bestial.  And they have no houses to lie in.  And they\r\neat more gladly man’s flesh than any other flesh.  Into that isle dare no\r\nman gladly enter.  And if they see a ship and men therein, anon they\r\nenter into the sea for to take them.\r\n\r\nAnd men said us, that in an isle beyond that were giants of greater\r\nstature, some of forty-five foot, or of fifty foot long, and, as some men\r\nsay, some of fifty cubits long.  But I saw none of those, for I had no\r\nlust to go to those parts, because that no man cometh neither into that\r\nisle ne into the other, but if he be devoured anon.  And among those\r\ngiants be sheep as great as oxen here, and they bear great wool and\r\nrough.  Of the sheep I have seen many times.  And men have seen, many\r\ntimes, those giants take men in the sea out of their ships, and brought\r\nthem to land, two in one hand and two in another, eating them going, all\r\nraw and all quick.\r\n\r\nAnother isle is there toward the north, in the sea Ocean, where that be\r\nfull cruel and full evil women of nature.  And they have precious stones\r\nin their eyen.  And they be of that kind, that if they behold any man\r\nwith wrath, they slay him anon with the beholding, as doth the basilisk.\r\n\r\nAnother isle is there, full fair and good and great, and full of people,\r\nwhere the custom is such, that the first night that they be married, they\r\nmake another man to lie by their wives for to have their maidenhead: and\r\ntherefore they take great hire and great thank.  And there be certain men\r\nin every town that serve of none other thing; and they clepe them\r\ncadeberiz, that is to say, the fools of wanhope.  For they of the country\r\nhold it so great a thing and so perilous for to have the maidenhead of a\r\nwoman, that them seemeth that they that have first the maidenhead putteth\r\nhim in adventure of his life.  And if the husband find his wife maiden\r\nthat other next night after that she should have been lain by of the man\r\nthat is assigned therefore, peradventure for drunkenness or for some\r\nother cause, the husband shall plain upon him that he hath not done his\r\ndevoir, in such cruel wise as though the officers would have slain him.\r\nBut after the first night that they be lain by, they keep them so\r\nstraitly that they be not so hardy to speak with no man.  And I asked\r\nthem the cause why that they held such custom: and they said me, that of\r\nold time men had been dead for deflowering of maidens, that had serpents\r\nin their bodies that stung men upon their yards, that they died anon: and\r\ntherefore they held that customs to make other men ordained therefore to\r\nlie by their wives, for dread of death, and to assay the passage by\r\nanother [rather] than for to put them in that adventure.\r\n\r\nAfter that is another isle where that women make great sorrow when their\r\nchildren be y-born.  And when they die, they make great feast and great\r\njoy and revel, and then they cast them into a great fire burning.  And\r\nthose that love well their husbands, if their husbands be dead, they cast\r\nthem also in the fire with their children, and burn them.  And they say\r\nthat the fire shall cleanse them of all filths and of all vices, and they\r\nshall go pured and clean into another world to their husbands, and they\r\nshall lead their children with them.  And the cause why that they weep,\r\nwhen their children be born is this; for when they come into this world,\r\nthey come to labour, sorrow and heaviness.  And why they make joy and\r\ngladness at their dying is because that, as they say, then they go to\r\nParadise where the rivers run milk and honey, where that men see them in\r\njoy and in abundance of goods, without sorrow and labour.\r\n\r\nIn that isle men make their king evermore by election, and they ne choose\r\nhim not for no noblesse nor for no riches, but such one as is of good\r\nmanners and of good conditions, and therewithal rightfull, and also that\r\nhe be of great age, and that he have no children.  In that isle men be\r\nfull rightfull and they do rightfull judgments in every cause both of\r\nrich and poor, small and great, after the quantity of the trespass that\r\nis mis-done.  And the king may not doom no man to death without assent of\r\nhis barons and other men wise of counsel, and that all the court accord\r\nthereto.  And if the king himself do any homicide or any crime, as to\r\nslay a man, or any such case, he shall die there for.  But he shall not\r\nbe slain as another man; but men shall defend, in pain of death, that no\r\nman be so hardy to make him company ne to speak with him, ne that no man\r\ngive him, ne sell him, ne serve him, neither of meat ne of drink; and so\r\nshall he die in mischief.  They spare no man that hath trespassed,\r\nneither for love, ne for favour ne for riches, ne for noblesse; but that\r\nhe shall have after that he hath done.\r\n\r\nBeyond that isle is another isle, where is great multitude of folk.  And\r\nthey will not, for no thing, eat flesh of hares, ne of hens, ne of geese;\r\nand yet they bring forth enough, for to see them and to behold them only;\r\nbut they eat flesh of all other beasts, and drink milk.  In that country\r\nthey take their daughters and their sisters to their wives, and their\r\nother kinswomen.  And if there be ten men or twelve men or more dwelling\r\nin an house, the wife of everych of them shall be common to them all that\r\ndwell in that house; so that every man may lie with whom he will of them\r\non one night, and with another, another night.  And if she have any\r\nchild, she may give it to what man that she list, that hath companied\r\nwith her, so that no man knoweth there whether the child be his or\r\nanother’s.  And if any man say to them, that they nourish other men’s\r\nchildren, they answer that so do over men theirs.\r\n\r\nIn that country and by all Ind be great plenty of cockodrills, that is a\r\nmanner of a long serpent, as I have said before.  And in the night they\r\ndwell in the water, and on the day upon the land, in rocks and in caves.\r\nAnd they eat no meat in all the winter, but they lie as in a dream, as do\r\nthe serpents.  These serpents slay men, and they eat them weeping; and\r\nwhen they eat they move the over jaw, and not the nether jaw, and they\r\nhave no tongue.\r\n\r\nIn that country and in many other beyond that, and also in many on this\r\nhalf, men put in work the seed of cotton, and they sow it every year.\r\nAnd then groweth it in small trees, that bear cotton.  And so do men\r\nevery year, so that there is plenty of cotton at all times.  Item; in\r\nthis isle and in many other, there is a manner of wood, hard and strong.\r\nWhoso covereth the coals of that wood under the ashes thereof, the coals\r\nwill dwell and abide all quick, a year or more.  And that tree hath many\r\nleaves, as the juniper hath.  And there be also many trees, that of\r\nnature they will never burn, ne rot in no manner.  And there be nut\r\ntrees, that bear nuts as great as a man’s head.\r\n\r\nThere also be many beasts, that be clept orafles.  In Arabia, they be\r\nclept gerfaunts.  That is a beast, pomely or spotted, that is but a\r\nlittle more high than is a steed, but he hath the neck a twenty cubits\r\nlong; and his croup and his tail is as of an hart; and he may look over a\r\ngreat high house.  And there be also in that country many camles; that is\r\na little beast as a goat, that is wild, and he liveth by the air and\r\neateth nought, ne drinketh nought, at no time.  And he changeth his\r\ncolour often-time, for men see him often sithes, now in one colour and\r\nnow in another colour; and he may change him into all manner colours that\r\nhim list, save only into red and white.  There be also in that country\r\npassing great serpents, some of six score foot long, and they be of\r\ndiverse colours, as rayed, red, green, and yellow, blue and black, and\r\nall speckled.  And there be others that have crests upon their heads, and\r\nthey go upon their feet, upright, and they be well a four fathom great,\r\nor more, and they dwell always in rocks or in mountains, and they have\r\nalway the throat open, of whence they drop venom always.  And there be\r\nalso wild swine of many colours, as great as be oxen in our country, and\r\nthey be all spotted, as be young fawns.  And there be also urchins, as\r\ngreat as wild swine here; we clepe them Porcz de Spine.  And there be\r\nlions all white, great and mighty.  And there be also of other beasts, as\r\ngreat and more greater than is a destrier, and men clepe them Loerancs;\r\nand some men clepe them odenthos; and they have a black head and three\r\nlong horns trenchant in the front, sharp as a sword, and the body is\r\nslender; and he is a full felonious beast, and he chaseth and slayeth the\r\nelephant.  There be also many other beasts, full wicked and cruel, that\r\nbe not mickle more than a bear, and they have the head like a boar, and\r\nthey have six feet, and on every foot two large claws, trenchant; and the\r\nbody is like a bear, and the tail as a lion.  And there be also mice as\r\ngreat as hounds, and yellow mice as great as ravens.  And there be geese,\r\nall red, three sithes more great than ours here, and they have the head,\r\nthe neck and the breast all black.\r\n\r\nAnd many other diverse beasts be in those countries, and elsewhere\r\nthere-about, and many diverse birds also, of the which it were too long\r\nfor to tell you.  And therefore, I pass over at this time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXII\r\n\r\n\r\n_Of the goodness of the folk of the Isle of Bragman_.  _Of King\r\nAlexander_.  _And wherefore the Emperor of Ind is clept Prester John_\r\n\r\nAND beyond that isle is another isle, great and good and plenteous, where\r\nthat be good folk and true, and of good living after their belief and of\r\ngood faith.  And albeit that they be not christened, ne have no perfect\r\nlaw, yet, natheles, of kindly law they be full of all virtue, and they\r\neschew all vices and all malices and all sins.  For they be not proud, ne\r\ncovetous, ne envious, ne wrathful, ne gluttons, ne lecherous.  Ne they do\r\nto any man otherwise than they would that other men did to them, and in\r\nthis point they fulfil the ten commandments of God, and give no charge of\r\navoir, ne of riches.  And they lie not, ne they swear not for none\r\noccasion, but they say simply, yea and nay; for they say, he that\r\nsweareth will deceive his neighbour, and therefore, all that they do,\r\nthey do it without oath.\r\n\r\nAnd men clepe that isle the Isle of Bragman, and some men clepe it the\r\nLand of Faith.  And through that land runneth a great river that is clept\r\nThebe.  And, in general, all the men of those isles and of all the\r\nmarches thereabout be more true than in any other countries thereabout,\r\nand more rightfull than others in all things.  In that isle is no thief,\r\nne murderer, ne common woman, ne poor beggar, ne never was man slain in\r\nthat country.  And they be so chaste, and lead so good life, as that they\r\nwere religious men, and they fast all days.  And because they be so true\r\nand so rightfull, and so full of all good conditions, they were never\r\ngrieved with tempests, ne with thunder, ne with light, ne with hail, ne\r\nwith pestilence, ne with war, ne with hunger, ne with none other\r\ntribulation, as we be, many times, amongst us, for our sins.  Wherefore,\r\nit seemeth well, that God loveth them and is pleased with their creaunce\r\nfor their good deeds.  They believe well in God, that made all things,\r\nand him they worship.  And they prize none earthly riches; and so they be\r\nall rightfull.  And they live full ordinately, and so soberly in meat and\r\ndrink, that they live right long.  And the most part of them die without\r\nsickness, when nature faileth them, for eld.\r\n\r\nAnd it befell in King Alexander’s time, that he purposed him to conquer\r\nthat isle and to make them to hold of him.  And when they of the country\r\nheard it, they sent messengers to him with letters, that said thus; What\r\nmay be enough to that man to whom all the world is insufficient?  Thou\r\nshalt find nothing in us, that may cause thee to war against us.  For we\r\nhave no riches, ne none we covet, and all the goods of our country be in\r\ncommon.  Our meat, that we sustain withal our bodies, is our riches.\r\nAnd, instead of treasure of gold and silver, we make our treasure of\r\naccord and peace, and for to love every man other.  And for to apparel\r\nwith our bodies we use a silly little clout for to wrap in our carrion.\r\nOur wives ne be not arrayed for to make no man pleasance, but only\r\nconvenable array for to eschew folly.  When men pain them to array the\r\nbody for to make it seem fairer than God made it, they do great sin.  For\r\nman should not devise ne ask greater beauty, than God hath ordained man\r\nto be at his birth.  The earth ministereth to us two things,—our\r\nlivelihood, that cometh of the earth that we live by, and our sepulture\r\nafter our death.  We have been in perpetual peace till now, that thou\r\ncome to disinherit us.  And also we have a king, not only for to do\r\njustice to every man, for he shall find no forfeit among us; but for to\r\nkeep noblesse, and for to shew that we be obeissant, we have a king.  For\r\njustice ne hath not among us no place, for we do to no man otherwise than\r\nwe desire that men do to us.  So that righteousness ne vengeance have\r\nnought to do among us.  So that nothing thou may take from us, but our\r\ngood peace, that always hath dured among us.\r\n\r\nAnd when King Alexander had read these letters, he thought that he should\r\ndo great sin, for to trouble them.  And then he sent them sureties, that\r\nthey should not be afeard of him, and that they should keep their good\r\nmanners and their good peace, as they had used before, of custom.  And so\r\nhe let them alone.\r\n\r\nAnother isle there is, that men clepe Oxidrate, and another isle, that\r\nmen clepe Gynosophe, where there is also good folk, and full of good\r\nfaith.  And they hold, for the most part, the good conditions and customs\r\nand good manners, as men of the country abovesaid; but they go all naked.\r\n\r\nInto that isle entered King Alexander, to see the manner.  And when he\r\nsaw their great faith, and their truth that was amongst them, he said\r\nthat he would not grieve them, and bade them ask of him what that they\r\nwould have of him, riches or anything else, and they should have it, with\r\ngood will.  And they answered, that he was rich enough that had meat and\r\ndrink to sustain the body with, for the riches of this world, that is\r\ntransitory, is not worth; but if it were in his power to make them\r\nimmortal, thereof would they pray him, and thank him.  And Alexander\r\nanswered them that it was not in his power to do it, because he was\r\nmortal, as they were.  And then they asked him why he was so proud and so\r\nfierce, and so busy for to put all the world under his subjection, right\r\nas thou were a God, and hast no term of this life, neither day ne hour,\r\nand willest to have all the world at thy commandment, that shall leave\r\nthee without fail, or thou leave it.  And right as it hath been to other\r\nmen before thee, right so it shall be to other after thee.  And from\r\nhence shalt thou bear nothing; but as thou were born naked, right so all\r\nnaked shall thy body be turned into earth that thou were made of.\r\nWherefore thou shouldest think and impress it in thy mind, that nothing\r\nis immortal, but only God, that made the thing.  By the which answer\r\nAlexander was greatly astonished and abashed, and all confused and\r\ndeparted from them.\r\n\r\nAnd albeit that these folk have not the articles of our faith as we have,\r\nnatheles, for their good faith natural, and for their good intent, I trow\r\nfully, that God loveth them, and that God take their service to gree,\r\nright as he did of Job, that was a paynim, and held him for his true\r\nservant.  And therefore, albeit that there be many diverse laws in the\r\nworld, yet I trow, that God loveth always them that love him, and serve\r\nhim meekly in truth, and namely them that despise the vain glory of this\r\nworld, as this folk do and as Job did also.\r\n\r\nAnd therefore said our Lord by the mouth of Hosea the prophet, _Ponam eis\r\nmultiplices leges meas_; and also in another place, _Qui totum orbem\r\nsubdit suis legibus_.  And also our Lord saith in the Gospel, _Alias oves\r\nhabeo_, _que non sunt ex hoc ovili_, that is to say, that he had other\r\nservants than those that be under Christian law.  And to that accordeth\r\nthe avision that Saint Peter saw at Jaffa, how the angel came from\r\nheaven, and brought before him diverse beasts, as serpents and other\r\ncreeping beasts of the earth, and of other also, great plenty, and bade\r\nhim take and eat.  And Saint Peter answered; I eat never, quoth he, of\r\nunclean beasts.  And then said the angel, _Non dicas immunda_, _que Deus\r\nmundavit_.  And that was in token that no man should have in despite none\r\nearthly man for their diverse laws, for we know not whom God loveth, ne\r\nwhom God hateth.  And for that example, when men say, _De profundis_,\r\nthey say it in common and in general, with the Christian, _Pro animabus\r\nomnium defunctorum_, _pro quibus sit orandum_.\r\n\r\nAnd therefore say I of this folk, that be so true and so faithful, that\r\nGod loveth them.  For he hath amongst them many of the prophets, and\r\nalway hath had.  And in those isles, they prophesied the Incarnation of\r\nLord Jesu Christ, how he should be born of a maiden, three thousand year\r\nor more or our Lord was born of the Virgin Mary.  And they believe well\r\nit, the Incarnation, and that full perfectly, but they know not the\r\nmanner, how he suffered his passion and death for us.\r\n\r\nAnd beyond these isles there is another isle that is clept Pytan.  The\r\nfolk of that country ne till not, ne labour not the earth, for they eat\r\nno manner thing.  And they be of good colour and of fair shape, after\r\ntheir greatness.  But the small be as dwarfs, but not so little as be the\r\nPigmies.  These men live by the smell of wild apples.  And when they go\r\nany far way, they bear the apples with them; for if they had lost the\r\nsavour of the apples, they should die anon.  They ne be not full\r\nreasonable, but they be simple and bestial.\r\n\r\nAfter that is another isle, where the folk be all skinned rough hair, as\r\na rough beast, save only the face and the palm of the hand.  These folk\r\ngo as well under the water of the sea, as they do above the land all dry.\r\nAnd they eat both flesh and fish all raw.  In this isle is a great river\r\nthat is well a two mile and an half of breadth that is clept Beaumare.\r\n\r\nAnd from that river a fifteen journeys in length, going by the deserts of\r\nthe tother side of the river—whoso might go it, for I was not there, but\r\nit was told us of them of the country, that within those deserts were the\r\ntrees of the sun and of the moon, that spake to King Alexander, and\r\nwarned him of his death.  And men say that the folk that keep those\r\ntrees, and eat of the fruit and of the balm that groweth there, live well\r\nfour hundred year or five hundred year, by virtue of the fruit and of the\r\nbalm.  For men say that balm groweth there in great plenty and nowhere\r\nelse, save only at Babylon, as I have told you before.  We would have\r\ngone toward the trees full gladly if we had might.  But I trow that\r\n100,000 men of arms might not pass those deserts safely, for the great\r\nmultitude of wild beasts and of great dragons and of great serpents that\r\nthere be, that slay and devour all that come anent them.  In that country\r\nbe many white elephants without number, and of unicorns and of lions of\r\nmany manners, and many of such beasts that I have told before, and of\r\nmany other hideous beasts without number.\r\n\r\nMany other isles there be in the land of Prester John, and many great\r\nmarvels, that were too long to tell all, both of his riches and of his\r\nnoblesse and of the great plenty also of precious stones that he hath.  I\r\ntrow that ye know well enough, and have heard say, wherefore this emperor\r\nis clept Prester John.  But, natheles, for them that know not, I shall\r\nsay you the cause.\r\n\r\nIt was sometime an emperor there, that was a worthy and a full noble\r\nprince, that had Christian knights in his company, as he hath that is\r\nnow.  So it befell, that he had great list for to see the service in the\r\nchurch among Christian men.  And then dured Christendom beyond the sea,\r\nall Turkey, Syria, Tartary, Jerusalem, Palestine, Arabia, Aleppo and all\r\nthe land of Egypt.  And so it befell that this emperor came with a\r\nChristian knight with him into a church in Egypt.  And it was the\r\nSaturday in Whitsun-week.  And the bishop made orders.  And he beheld,\r\nand listened the service full tentively.  And he asked the Christian\r\nknight what men of degree they should be that the prelate had before him.\r\nAnd the knight answered and said that they should be priests.  And then\r\nthe emperor said that he would no longer be clept king ne emperor, but\r\npriest, and that he would have the name of the first priest that went out\r\nof the church, and his name was John.  And so ever-more sithens, he is\r\nclept Prester John.\r\n\r\nIn his land be many Christian men of good faith and of good law, and\r\nnamely of them of the same country, and have commonly their priests, that\r\nsing the Mass, and make the sacrament of the altar, of bread, right as\r\nthe Greeks do; but they say not so many things at the Mass as men do\r\nhere.  For they say not but only that that the apostles said, as our Lord\r\ntaught them, right as Saint Peter and Saint Thomas and the other apostles\r\nsung the Mass, saying the _Pater Noster_ and the words of the sacrament.\r\nBut we have many more additions that divers popes have made, that they ne\r\nknow not of.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIII\r\n\r\n\r\n _Of the Hills of Gold that Pismires keep_.  _And of the four Floods that\r\n                     come from Paradise Terrestrial_\r\n\r\nTOWARD the east part of Prester John’s land is an isle good and great,\r\nthat men clepe Taprobane, that is full noble and full fructuous.  And the\r\nking thereof is full rich, and is under the obeissance of Prester John.\r\nAnd always there they make their king by election.  In that isle be two\r\nsummers and two winters, and men harvest the corn twice a year.  And in\r\nall the seasons of the year be the gardens flourished.  There dwell good\r\nfolk and reasonable, and many Christian men amongst them, that be so rich\r\nthat they wit not what to do with their goods.  Of old time, when men\r\npassed from the land of Prester John unto that isle, men made ordinance\r\nfor to pass by ship, twenty-three days, or more; but now men pass by ship\r\nin seven days.  And men may see the bottom of the sea in many places, for\r\nit is not full deep.\r\n\r\nBeside that isle, toward the east, be two other isles.  And men clepe\r\nthat one Orille, and that other Argyte, of the which all the land is mine\r\nof gold and silver.  And those isles be right where that the Red Sea\r\ndeparteth from the sea ocean.  And in those isles men see there no stars\r\nso clearly as in other places.  For there appear no stars, but only one\r\nclear star that men clepe Canapos.  And there is not the moon seen in all\r\nthe lunation, save only the second quarter.\r\n\r\nIn the isle also of this Taprobane be great hills of gold, that pismires\r\nkeep full diligently.  And they fine the pured gold, and cast away the\r\nun-pured.  And these pismires be great as hounds, so that no man dare\r\ncome to those hills for the pismires would assail them and devour them\r\nanon.  So that no man may get of that gold, but by great sleight.  And\r\ntherefore when it is great heat, the pismires rest them in the earth,\r\nfrom prime of the day into noon.  And then the folk of the country take\r\ncamels, dromedaries, and horses and other beasts, and go thither, and\r\ncharge them in all haste that they may; and after that, they flee away in\r\nall haste that the beasts may go, or the pismires come out of the earth.\r\nAnd in other times, when it is not so hot, and that the pismires ne rest\r\nthem not in the earth, then they get gold by this subtlety.  They take\r\nmares that have young colts or foals, and lay upon the mares void vessels\r\nmade there-for; and they be all open above, and hanging low to the earth.\r\nAnd then they send forth those mares for to pasture about those hills,\r\nand with-hold the foals with them at home.  And when the pismires see\r\nthose vessels, they leap in anon: and they have this kind that they let\r\nnothing be empty among them, but anon they fill it, be it what manner of\r\nthing that it be; and so they fill those vessels with gold.  And when\r\nthat the folk suppose that the vessels be full, they put forth anon the\r\nyoung foals, and make them to neigh after their dams.  And then anon the\r\nmares return towards their foals with their charges of gold.  And then\r\nmen discharges them, and get gold enough by this subtlety.  For the\r\npismires will suffer beasts to go and pasture amongst them, but no man in\r\nno wise.\r\n\r\nAnd beyond the land and the isles and the deserts of Prester John’s\r\nlordship, in going straight toward the east, men find nothing but\r\nmountains and rocks, full great.  And there is the dark region, where no\r\nman may see, neither by day ne by night, as they of the country say.  And\r\nthat desert and that place of darkness dure from this coast unto Paradise\r\nterrestrial, where that Adam, our formest father, and Eve were put, that\r\ndwelled there but little while: and that is towards the east at the\r\nbeginning of the earth.  But that is not that east that we clepe our\r\neast, on this half, where the sun riseth to us.  For when the sun is east\r\nin those parts towards Paradise terrestrial, it is then midnight in our\r\nparts on this half, for the roundness of the earth, of the which I have\r\ntouched to you of before.  For our Lord God made the earth all round in\r\nthe mid place of the firmament.  And there as mountains and hills be and\r\nvalleys, that is not but only of Noah’s flood, that wasted the soft\r\nground and the tender, and fell down into valleys, and the hard earth and\r\nthe rocks abide mountains, when the soft earth and tender waxed nesh\r\nthrough the water, and fell and became valleys.\r\n\r\nOf Paradise ne can I not speak properly.  For I was not there.  It is far\r\nbeyond.  And that forthinketh me.  And also I was not worthy.  But as I\r\nhave heard say of wise men beyond, I shall tell you with good will.\r\n\r\nParadise terrestrial, as wise men say, is the highest place of earth,\r\nthat is in all the world.  And it is so high that it toucheth nigh to the\r\ncircle of the moon, there as the moon maketh her turn; for she is so high\r\nthat the flood of Noah ne might not come to her, that would have covered\r\nall the earth of the world all about and above and beneath, save Paradise\r\nonly alone.  And this Paradise is enclosed all about with a wall, and men\r\nwit not whereof it is; for the walls be covered all over with moss, as it\r\nseemeth.  And it seemeth not that the wall is stone of nature, ne of none\r\nother thing that the wall is.  And that wall stretcheth from the south to\r\nthe north, and it hath not but one entry that is closed with fire,\r\nburning; so that no man that is mortal ne dare not enter.\r\n\r\nAnd in the most high place of Paradise, even in the middle place, is a\r\nwell that casteth out the four floods that run by divers lands.  Of the\r\nwhich, the first is clept Pison, or Ganges, that is all one; and it\r\nrunneth throughout Ind or Emlak, in the which river be many precious\r\nstones, and much of lignum aloes and much gravel of gold.  And that other\r\nriver is clept Nilus or Gison, that goeth by Ethiopia and after by Egypt.\r\nAnd that other is clept Tigris, that runneth by Assyria and by Armenia\r\nthe great.  And that other is clept Euphrates, that runneth also by Media\r\nand Armenia and by Persia.  And men there beyond say, that all the sweet\r\nwaters of the world, above and beneath, take their beginning of the well\r\nof Paradise, and out of that well all waters come and go.\r\n\r\nThe first river is clept Pison, that is to say in their language\r\nAssembly; for many other rivers meet them there, and go into that river.\r\nAnd some men clepe it Ganges, for a king that was in Ind, that hight\r\nGangeres, and that it ran throughout his land.  And that water [is] in\r\nsome place clear, and in some place troubled, in some place hot, and in\r\nsome place cold.\r\n\r\nThe second river is clept Nilus or Gison; for it is always trouble; and\r\nGison, in the language of Ethiopia, is to say, trouble, and in the\r\nlanguage of Egypt also.\r\n\r\nThe third river, that is dept Tigris, is as much for to say as,\r\nfast-running; for he runneth more fast than any of the tother; and also\r\nthere is a beast, that is clept tigris, that is fast-running.\r\n\r\nThe fourth river is clept Euphrates, that is to say, well-bearing; for\r\nthere grow many goods upon that river, as corns, fruits and other goods\r\nenough plenty.\r\n\r\nAnd ye shall understand that no man that is mortal ne may not approach to\r\nthat Paradise.  For by land no man may go for wild beasts that be in the\r\ndeserts, and for the high mountains and great huge rocks that no man may\r\npass by, for the dark places that be there, and that many.  And by the\r\nrivers may no man go.  For the water runneth so rudely and so sharply,\r\nbecause that it cometh down so outrageously from the high places above,\r\nthat it runneth in so great waves, that no ship may not row ne sail\r\nagainst it.  And the water roareth so, and maketh so huge noise and so\r\ngreat tempest, that no man may hear other in the ship, though he cried\r\nwith all the craft that he could in the highest voice that he might.\r\nMany great lords have assayed with great will, many times, for to pass by\r\nthose rivers towards Paradise, with full great companies.  But they might\r\nnot speed in their voyage.  And many died for weariness of rowing against\r\nthose strong waves.  And many of them became blind, and many deaf, for\r\nthe noise of the water.  And some were perished and lost within the\r\nwaves.  So that no mortal man may approach to that place, without special\r\ngrace of God, so that of that place I can say you no more; and therefore,\r\nI shall hold me still, and return to that, that I have seen.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIV\r\n\r\n\r\n_Of the Customs of Kings and other that dwell in the Isles coasting to\r\nPrester John’s Land_.  _And of the Worship that the Son doth to the\r\nFather when he is dead_\r\n\r\nFROM those isles that I have spoken of before, in the Land of Prester\r\nJohn, that be under earth as to us that be on this half, and of other\r\nisles that be more further beyond, whoso will, pursue them for to come\r\nagain right to the parts that he came from, and so environ all earth.\r\nBut what for the isles, what for the sea, and what for strong rowing, few\r\nfolk assay for to pass that passage; albeit that men might do it well,\r\nthat might be of power to dress them thereto, as I have said you before.\r\nAnd therefore men return from those isles abovesaid by other isles,\r\ncoasting from the land of Prester John.\r\n\r\nAnd then come men in returning to an isle that is clept Casson.  And that\r\nisle hath well sixty journeys in length, and more than fifty in breadth.\r\nThis is the best isle and the best kingdom that is in all those parts,\r\nout-taken Cathay.  And if the merchants used as much that country as they\r\ndo Cathay, it would be better than Cathay in a short while.  This country\r\nis full well inhabited, and so full of cities and of good towns inhabited\r\nwith people, that when a man goeth out of one city, men see another city\r\neven before them; and that is what part that a man go, in all that\r\ncountry.  In that isle is great plenty of all goods for to live with, and\r\nof all manner of spices.  And there be great forests of chestnuts.  The\r\nking of that isle is full rich and full mighty, and, natheles, he holds\r\nhis land of the great Chan, and is obeissant to him.  For it is one of\r\nthe twelve provinces that the great Chan hath under him without his\r\nproper land, and without other less isles that he hath; for he hath full\r\nmany.\r\n\r\nFrom that kingdom come men, in returning, to another isle that is clept\r\nRybothe, and it is also under the great Chan.  That is a full good\r\ncountry, and full plenteous of all goods and of wines and fruit and all\r\nother riches.  And the folk of that country have no houses, but they\r\ndwell and lie all under tents made of black fern, by all the country.\r\nAnd the principal city and the most royal is all walled with black stone\r\nand white.  And all the streets also be pathed of the same stones.  In\r\nthat city is no man so hardy to shed blood of any man, ne of no beast,\r\nfor the reverence of an idol that is worshipped there.  And in that isle\r\ndwelleth the pope of their law, that they clepe Lobassy.  This Lobassy\r\ngiveth all the benefices, and all other dignities and all other things\r\nthat belong to the idol.  And all those that hold anything of their\r\nchurches, religious and other, obey to him, as men do here to the Pope of\r\nRome.\r\n\r\nIn that isle they have a custom by all the country, that when the father\r\nis dead of any man, and the son list to do great worship to his father,\r\nhe sendeth to all his friends and to all his kin, and for religious men\r\nand priests, and for minstrels also, great plenty.  And then men bear the\r\ndead body unto a great hill with great joy and solemnity.  And when they\r\nhave brought it thither, the chief prelate smiteth off the head, and\r\nlayeth it upon a great platter of gold and of silver, if so [he] be a\r\nrich man.  And then he taketh the head to the son.  And then the son and\r\nhis other kin sing and say many orisons.  And then the priests and the\r\nreligious men smite all the body of the dead man in pieces.  And then\r\nthey say certain orisons.  And the fowls of ravine of all the country\r\nabout know the custom of long time before, [and] come flying above in the\r\nair; as eagles, gledes, ravens and other fowls of ravine, that eat flesh.\r\nAnd then the priests cast the gobbets of the flesh and then the fowls,\r\neach of them, taketh that he may, and goeth a little thence and eateth\r\nit; and so they do whilst any piece lasteth of the dead body.\r\n\r\nAnd after that, as priests amongst us sing for the dead, _Subvenite\r\nSancti Dei_, _etc._, right so the priests sing with high voice in their\r\nlanguage; Behold how so worthy a man and how good a man this was, that\r\nthe angels of God come for to seek him and for to bring him into\r\nParadise.  And then seemeth it to the son, that he is highly worshipped,\r\nwhen that many birds and fowls and ravens come and eat his father; and he\r\nthat hath most number of fowls is most worshipped.\r\n\r\nAnd then the son bringeth home with him all his kin, and his friends, and\r\nall the others to his house, and maketh them a great feast.  And then all\r\nhis friends make their vaunt and their dalliance, how the fowls came\r\nthither, here five, here six, here ten, and there twenty, and so forth;\r\nand they rejoice them hugely for to speak thereof.  And when they be at\r\nmeat, the son let bring forth the head of his father, and thereof he\r\ngiveth of the flesh to his most special friends, instead of _entre\r\nmesse_, or a _sukkarke_.  And of the brain pan, he letteth make a cup,\r\nand thereof drinketh he and his other friends also, with great devotion,\r\nin remembrance of the holy man, that the angels of God have eaten.  And\r\nthat cup the son shall keep to drink of all his life-time, in remembrance\r\nof his father.\r\n\r\nFrom that land, in returning by ten journeys throughout the land of the\r\ngreat Chan, is another good isle and a great kingdom, where the king is\r\nfull rich and mighty.\r\n\r\nAnd amongst the rich men of his country is a passing rich man, that is no\r\nprince, ne duke, ne earl, but he hath more that hold of him lands and\r\nother lordships, for he is more rich.  For he hath, every year, of annual\r\nrent 300,000 horses charged with corn of diverse grains and of rice.  And\r\nso he leadeth a full noble life and a delicate, after the custom of the\r\ncountry.  For he hath, every day, fifty fair damosels, all maidens, that\r\nserve him evermore at his meat, and for to lie by him o’ night, and for\r\nto do with them that is to his pleasance.  And when he is at table, they\r\nbring him his meat at every time, five and five together; and in bringing\r\ntheir service they sing a song.  And after that, they cut his meat, and\r\nput it in his mouth; for he toucheth nothing, ne handleth nought, but\r\nholdeth evermore his hands before him upon the table.  For he hath so\r\nlong nails, that he may take nothing, ne handle nothing.  For the\r\nnoblesse of that country is to have long nails, and to make them grow\r\nalways to be as long as men may.  And there be many in that country, that\r\nhave their nails so long, that they environ all the hand.  And that is a\r\ngreat noblesse.  And the noblesse of the women is for to have small feet\r\nand little.  And therefore anon as they be born, they let bind their feet\r\nso strait, that they may not grow half as nature would.  And this is the\r\nnoblesse of the women there to have small feet and little.  And always\r\nthese damosels, that I spake of before, sing all the time that this rich\r\nman eateth.  And when that he eateth no more of his first course, then\r\nother five and five of fair damsels bring him his second course, always\r\nsinging as they did before.  And so they do continually every day to the\r\nend of his meat.  And in this manner he leadeth his life.  And so did\r\nthey before him, that were his ancestors.  And so shall they that come\r\nafter him, without doing of any deeds of arms, but live evermore thus in\r\nease, as a. swine that is fed in sty for to be made fat.  He hath a full\r\nfair palace and full rich, where that he dwelleth in, of the which the\r\nwalls be, in circuit, two mile.  And he hath within many fair gardens,\r\nand many fair halls and chambers; and the pavement of his halls and\r\nchambers be of gold and silver.  And in the mid place of one of his\r\ngardens is a little mountain, where there is a little meadow.  And in\r\nthat meadow is a little toothill with towers and pinnacles, all of gold.\r\nAnd in that little toothill will he sit often-time, for to take the air\r\nand to disport him.  For the place is made for nothing else, but only for\r\nhis disport.\r\n\r\nFrom that country men come by the land of the great Chan also, that I\r\nhave spoken of before.\r\n\r\nAnd ye shall understand, that of all these countries, and of all these\r\nisles, and of all the diverse folk, that I have spoken of before, and of\r\ndiverse laws, and of diverse beliefs that they have, yet is there none of\r\nthem all but that they have some reason within them and understanding,\r\nbut if it be the fewer, and that have certain articles of our faith and\r\nsome good points of our belief, and that they believe in God, that formed\r\nall things and made the world, and clepe him God of Nature; after that\r\nthe prophet saith, _Et metuent eum omnes fines terrae_, and also in\r\nanother place, _Omnes gentes servient ei_, that is to say, ‘All folk\r\nshall serve him.’\r\n\r\nBut yet they cannot speak perfectly (for there is no man to teach them),\r\nbut only that they can devise by their natural wit.  For they have no\r\nknowledge of the Son, ne of the Holy Ghost.  But they can all speak of\r\nthe Bible, and namely of Genesis, of the prophet’s saws and of the books\r\nof Moses.  And they say well, that the creatures that † they worship ne\r\nbe no gods; but they worship them for the virtue that is in them, that\r\nmay not be but only by the grace of God.  And of simulacres and of idols,\r\nthey say, that there be no folk, but that they have simulacres.  And that\r\nthey say, for we Christian men have images, as of our Lady and of other\r\nsaints that we worship; not the images of tree or of stone, but the\r\nsaints, in whose name they be made after.  For right as the books and the\r\nscripture of them teach the clerks how and in what manner they shall\r\nbelieve, right so the images and the paintings teach the lewd folk to\r\nworship the saints and to have them in their mind, in whose names that\r\nthe images be made after.  They say also, that the angels of God speak to\r\nthem in those idols, and that they do many great miracles.  And they say\r\nsooth, that there is an angel within them.  For there be two manner of\r\nangels, a good and an evil, as the Greeks say, Cacho and Calo.  This\r\nCacho is the wicked angel, and Calo is the good angel.  But the tother is\r\nnot the good angel, but the wicked angel that is within the idols to\r\ndeceive them and for to maintain them in their error.\r\n\r\nThere be many other divers countries and many other marvels beyond, that\r\nI have not seen.  Wherefore, of them I cannot speak properly to tell you\r\nthe manner of them.  And also in the countries where I have been, be many\r\nmore diversities of many wonderful things than I make mention of; for it\r\nwere too long thing to devise you the manner.  And therefore, that that I\r\nhave devised you of certain countries, that I have spoken of before, I\r\nbeseech your worthy and excellent noblesse, that it suffice to you at\r\nthis time.  For if that I devised you all that is beyond the sea, another\r\nman, peradventure, that would pain him and travail his body for to go\r\ninto those marches for to ensearch those countries, might be blamed by my\r\nwords in rehearsing many strange things; for he might not say nothing of\r\nnew, in the which the hearers might have either solace, or disport, or\r\nlust, or liking in the hearing.  For men say always, that new things and\r\nnew tidings be pleasant to hear.  Wherefore I will hold me still, without\r\nany more rehearsing of diversities or of marvels that be beyond, to that\r\nintent and end, that whoso will go into those countries, he shall find\r\nenough to speak of, that I have not touched of in no wise.\r\n\r\nAnd ye shall understand, if it like you, that at mine home-coming, I came\r\nto Rome, and shewed my life to our holy father the pope, and was assoiled\r\nof all that lay in my conscience, of many a diverse grievous point; as\r\nmen must needs that be in company, dwelling amongst so many a diverse\r\nfolk of diverse sect and of belief, as I have been.\r\n\r\nAnd amongst all I shewed him this treatise, that I had made after\r\ninformation of men that knew of things that I had not seen myself, and\r\nalso of marvels and customs that I had seen myself, as far as God would\r\ngive me grace; and besought his holy fatherhood, that my book might be\r\nexamined and corrected by advice of his wise and discreet council.  And\r\nour holy father, of his special grace, remitted my book to be examined\r\nand proved by the advice of his said counsel.  By the which my book was\r\nproved for true, insomuch, that they shewed me a book, that my book was\r\nexamined by, that comprehended full much more, by an hundred part, by the\r\nwhich the _Mappa Mundi_ was made after.  And so my book (albeit that many\r\nmen ne list not to give credence to nothing, but to that that they see\r\nwith their eye, ne be the author ne the person never so true) is affirmed\r\nand proved by our holy father, in manner and form as I have said.\r\n\r\nAnd I, John Mandevile, knight, abovesaid (although I be unworthy), that\r\ndeparted from our countries and passed the sea, the year of grace a\r\nthousand three hundred and twenty two, that have passed many lands and\r\nmany isles and countries, and searched many full strange places, and have\r\nbeen in many a full good honourable company, and at many a fair deed of\r\narms (albeit that I did none myself, for mine unable insuffisance), now I\r\nam come home, maugre myself, to rest, for gouts artetykes that me\r\ndistrain, that define the end of my labour; against my will (God\r\nknoweth).\r\n\r\nAnd thus, taking solace in my wretched rest, recording the time passed, I\r\nhave fulfilled these things, and put them written in this book, as it\r\nwould come into my mind, the year of grace a thousand three hundred and\r\nfifty six, in the thirty-fourth year, that I departed from our countries.\r\n\r\nWherefore, I pray to all the readers and hearers of this book, if it\r\nplease them, that they would pray to God for me; and I shall pray for\r\nthem.  And all those that say for me a _Pater Noster_, with an _Ave\r\nMaria_, that God forgive me my sins, I make them partners, and grant them\r\npart of all the good pilgrimages and of all the good deeds that I have\r\ndone, if any be to his pleasance; and not only of those, but of all that\r\never I shall do unto my life’s end.  And I beseech Almighty God, from\r\nwhom all goodness and grace cometh from, that he vouchsafe of his\r\nexcellent mercy and abundant grace, to fulfil their souls with\r\ninspiration of the Holy Ghost, in making defence of all their ghostly\r\nenemies here in earth, to their salvation both of body and soul; to\r\nworship and thanking of him, that is three and one, without beginning and\r\nwithout ending; that is without quality, good, without quantity, great;\r\nthat in all places is present, and all things containing; the which that\r\nno goodness may amend, ne none evil impair; that in perfect Trinity\r\nliveth and reigneth God, by all worlds, and by all times!\r\n\r\n_Amen_!  _Amen_!  _Amen_!\r\n\r\n                                * * * * *\r\n\r\n                [HERE ENDETH THE BOOK OF JOHN MANDEVILLE.]\r\n\r\n                                * * * * *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES\r\n\r\n\r\n{0}  The supplement was not transcribed as part of the original Project\r\nGutenberg release.
