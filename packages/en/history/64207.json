Moreover, if the diagnostics and prognostics be of the\r\ngreatest moment in physic, and are only to be collected from long and\r\naccurate observation, then the records left us by the ancients, who\r\nwere so assiduous in their observations, so clear and exact in their\r\ndescriptions, must be allowed to contain a valuable treasure of medical\r\nknowledge.\r\n\r\nWe have seen, in the present age, many learned physicians, who, though\r\nthey readily admit the improvements of the moderns, nevertheless apply\r\nthemselves with great industry to the study of the ancients; and\r\nindeed, to say nothing of the superiority of some of the ancients in\r\nstile and composition, as a matter of taste, I think it can hardly\r\nbe denied, that a man, capable of making proper allowances for the\r\nvariations in respect of climate and manner of living, may receive\r\ngreat benefit from the materials left us by these ingenious writers\r\nof antiquity, and find many hints, which, pursued with diligence, and\r\napplied with caution, may both correct and enlarge his practice.\r\n\r\nCelsus is justly esteemed one of the most valuable amongst the\r\nancients. He is so often quoted, with approbation, by our best writers\r\nin physic, and so much admired by the learned world for propriety,\r\nease, and elegance, that it is a needless attempt in these days to draw\r\nhis character. However, he is so little mentioned by the ancients, that\r\nour curiosity cannot be gratified with any particulars of his life; nor\r\ncan we even determine what was his profession, if it does not appear\r\nfrom his writings.\r\n\r\nQuintilian often mentions a treatise of his upon rhetoric, which though\r\nhe hardly ever quotes, but where he differs from him, he allows to be\r\ncomposed with accuracy. But whatever he thought of his oratory, he\r\ngives an honourable testimony to the extent of his learning. For to\r\npersuade his student of eloquence to make himself master of all the\r\nsciences, after mentioning the greatest geniuses that ever appeared in\r\nGreece or Rome, as Homer, Plato, Aristotle, Cato the censor, Varro,\r\nand Cicero, he adds, “Why should I name any more instances? when even\r\nCornelius Celsus, a man of a moderate share of genius, has not only\r\ncomposed treatises on all these arts, but has also left precepts of\r\nthe military art, agriculture, and medicine. The bare attempt requires\r\nus to believe he understood all these subjects: but to give perfection\r\nto so great a work is a difficult task, to which no man was ever found\r\nequal[A].”\r\n\r\n  [A] Fab. Quintilian, lib. xii. c. 11.\r\n\r\nSome have complained of the partiality, or jealousy of the rhetorician,\r\nwho allows Celsus only a moderate share of genius. Others esteem it\r\nno diminution to be placed in a rank below the writers above named.\r\nWithout doubt, this would do him very great honour: but if we even\r\ntake the character literally, still we are to consider Quintilian as\r\nhaving every where in view the perfection of oratory. Now this, it\r\nshould appear, Celsus hardly affected, by his confining the orator\r\nto questions in dispute[B]; which in great measure excludes the\r\ndescriptive and moving parts of the art: therefore Quintilian’s man\r\nof middling genius may be a perfect writer in the instructive manner,\r\nthough he want the qualifications for the bar or the forum. But to do\r\nCelsus some farther honour, may it not be supposed, that had Quintilian\r\nbeen as competent a judge of his medical, as of his rhetorical\r\nwritings, he would not have stiled him, _Vir mediocri ingenio_. I\r\nhave made bold to hazard this observation from an opinion, that none\r\nbut a physician can form a just idea of the excellence of this work;\r\nmuch less could any but a physician be the author of it. Celsus the\r\nphysician might very well write on agriculture, &c. but it by no means\r\nfollows, that Celsus, not versed in the practice of physic, could\r\nhave written accurately on diseases. If then this notion be just, it\r\nmay reasonably be concluded, that his medical writings were the most\r\nperfect, as being the fruit of his principal and particular studies.\r\n\r\n  [B] Id. lib. iii. c. 5.\r\n\r\nColumella (_De re rustica_) often quotes him with great deference to\r\nhis authority; he equals him to the most learned writers on husbandry;\r\nand when he is correcting a vulgar error, expresses his surprise\r\nthat Cornelius Celsus could be misled, “who was not only skilled in\r\nagriculture, but took in the whole compass of natural knowledge[C].” I\r\nshall not recite all the passages, where he mentions Celsus, but cannot\r\nhelp transcribing one, it is so expressive of our author’s manner. It\r\nis on the article of bees, “concerning which (says he) it is impossible\r\nto surpass the diligence of Hyginus, the profusion of ornaments in\r\nVirgil, and the _elegance_ of Celsus. Hyginus has with great industry\r\ncollected the precepts, which lay scattered in the ancients; Virgil\r\nhas adorned the subject with poetic flowers; and in Celsus we find a\r\njudicious mixture of both these manners[D].”\r\n\r\n  [C] Columell. lib. 2. c. 2.\r\n\r\n  [D] Id. lib. ix. c. 2.\r\n\r\nFrom Columella’s mentioning Celsus as a contemporary, but not as\r\na living writer[E], and our author’s speaking of Themison in the\r\nsame manner[F], Le Clerc infers, with great probability, that Celsus\r\nwrote towards the latter end of the reign of Augustus, or at latest,\r\nin the beginning of Tiberius; in which last period he is placed by\r\nFabricius[G]. And that he cannot have been later, appears not only from\r\nthese authorities, but almost undeniably from the purity and elegance\r\nof his style, more nearly allied to the Augustan, than any of the\r\nsucceeding ages.\r\n\r\n  [E] Id. lib. i. c. 1.\r\n\r\n  [F] Celsi praefat. lib. i.\r\n\r\n  [G] Biblioth. Latin. lib. ii. c. 4.\r\n\r\nBoth Columella and Quintilian seem to speak of him as a Roman, and\r\nindeed our author himself, when he is giving the Greek name for any\r\ndistemper, and is to add the Roman, frequently uses this phrase,\r\n_nostri vocant, our countrymen call it_, or some other expression of\r\nthe same nature[H].\r\n\r\n  [H] _Nostri anginam vocant_, lib. iv. c. 4.--_Apud nos indecorum, sed\r\n  commune his herniae nomen est_, lib. vii. c. 18.--_Nostri vero sub\r\n  eodem nomine, quo priora habent_, ib.\r\n\r\nWe have seen by the above quotations, how many treatises were composed\r\nby Celsus, which have all perished in the barbarous ages, except this\r\nwork on medicine; which from the manner of its beginning, _Ut alimenta\r\nsanis corporibus agricultura, sic medicina ægris sanitatem promittit_,\r\nseems to have immediately followed his book on husbandry: for this\r\neasy transition is very common with our author in connecting different\r\nsubjects. What confirms this is, that H. Stephens, upon the authority\r\nof an ancient manuscript, has prefixed as the title, _Aurelii Cornelii\r\nCelsi de re medica libri octo; operis ab eo scripti de artibus pars\r\nsexta_. It would be still more evident, if we could depend upon the\r\nmanuscript in the library of Alex. Paduan: in which, at the end of\r\nthe fourth book is written, _Artium Cornelii Celsi liber nonus, idem\r\nmedicinæ liber quartus explicit feliciter_[I]. For his agriculture\r\ncontained five books[J], with which the first four of this work make up\r\nthe nine.\r\n\r\n  [I] Morgagni Ep. 2. p. 41.\r\n\r\n  [J] _Quippe Cornelius totum corpus disciplinae quinque libris\r\n  complexus est_, Columell. lib. 1. c. 1.\r\n\r\nEvery trifling circumstance relating to our author has employed the\r\nindustry of his learned commentators. The English reader will therefore\r\nforgive me for observing, that in most of the manuscripts, his name\r\nis written A. Cornelius Celsus. And Rubeus informs us, the ancient\r\nmanuscript in the Vatican library has this title, _Auli Cornelii Celsi\r\nliber sextus, idemque medicinæ primus_. As _Aurelius_ was the name of\r\na Roman family, it is not probable that this would be his praenomen;\r\non the contrary, _Aulus_ is found to be a common praenomen in the\r\nCornelian family[K]. For these reasons, I read his name A. that is\r\n_Aulus, &c._ instead of _Aurelius_, as most of the printed copies have\r\nit.\r\n\r\n  [K] Morgagni Ep. iv. p. 75.\r\n\r\nFrom our author’s admirable abstract of the history of physic, it is\r\neasy to see he had studied and thoroughly digested the writings of the\r\npreceding physicians, and been attentive to the practice, as well as\r\nto the arguments of the several sects. We have no reason to doubt he\r\nmade the best use of them; for we see that he confined himself to no\r\none party, but selected from each what he judged to be most salutary.\r\nThough he has quoted many authors, sometimes with a view to recommend\r\ntheir practice in particular cases, at other times to shew the\r\nimpropriety of it; yet through the whole, Hippocrates and Asclepiades\r\nseem to have been highest in his esteem; but he does not give up his\r\njudgment implicitly to these for he often leaves both, and advances\r\nvery good reasons for differing from them. He ingenuously owns[L],\r\nthat he has borrowed the prognostics from Hippocrates, “because,” says\r\nhe, “though the moderns have made alterations in the method of curing,\r\nnevertheless they allow, that he has left the best prognostics.” With\r\nregard to the critical days, he entirely condemns his doctrine, and\r\nfollows Asclepiades in rejecting the notion as idle and chimerical[M].\r\nBut from both these authors he dissents in his rules about bleeding.\r\n\r\n  [L] Præfat. lib. ii.\r\n\r\n  [M] Lib. iii. c. 4.\r\n\r\nIt would be superfluous for me to prefix to this translation a general\r\nview of Celsus’s practice in the various diseases; for besides that\r\nthis is already done by the learned Le Clerc[N], our author’s method\r\nis so clear and concise, that the reader will acquire, with ease, the\r\nmost perfect idea from the book itself.\r\n\r\n  [N] Histoire de la medicine, P. ii. liv. iv. sect. ii. chap. 4, &c.\r\n\r\nWhenever he differs in opinion from writers, whose authority he\r\notherwise reveres, we find his reasoning modest, concise, close, and\r\nadmirably well adapted to the subject in dispute; but the delicacy\r\nof his expression, when he condemns others, and the caution with\r\nwhich he avoids speaking of himself, have led some to believe he was\r\nnot a practitioner: though the strongest argument against his having\r\npractised physic is drawn from the silence of Pliny, who names Celsus,\r\nin several books, among the authors from whom he took his materials,\r\nand never ranks him in the list of physicians, whom he separates\r\nfrom the others. But I am surprised it has escaped the observation\r\nof the critics, that these catalogues of physicians consist only of\r\nforeigners, whom Pliny distinguishes from other foreigners, who were\r\nnot physicians; whereas Celsus stands always amongst the Romans. Now\r\nPliny, in his list of Roman writers, has not noted their several\r\nprofessions: for in most of the places, where we read the name of\r\nCelsus, we also find that of Antonius Castor, without any mention of\r\nhis profession, though Pliny himself in another place tells us[O], he\r\nwas a physician of great reputation, whom he saw living in retirement,\r\nand cultivating a kind of physic-garden, when he was above an\r\nhundred years old. Thus, the name of Antonius Castor would have been\r\nlost with his writings, notwithstanding the figure he made among his\r\ncontemporaries, had he not happened to be mentioned by Pliny. And hence\r\nit appears, that nothing can be inferred from the silence of Pliny and\r\nthe other ancients, in regard to the profession of Celsus; though he\r\nshould not be Cornelius the physician, mentioned by Galen, as Le Clerc\r\nthinks it probable he is.\r\n\r\n  [O] Plin. Nat. Hist. lib. xxv. c. 2.\r\n\r\nI might have urged many passages in this book to prove that he was a\r\nphysician, if I had not reason to think the present age is already\r\nsatisfied in that point. There are two, however, so remarkable, that\r\nthey ought not to be omitted. When our author is considering the proper\r\ntime for allowing nourishment, after saying that some gave their\r\npatients food in the evening, he gives reasons against that method,\r\nand then adds, “_Ob haec ad mediam noctem decurro_, i. e. For these\r\nreasons I defer it till midnight.” Thus most of the older copies read,\r\nand also Morgagni’s manuscript; so that Linden is not easily to be\r\nforgiven for making alterations in so material a place[P]. In the other\r\npassages there is no variation in the reading. In that species of the\r\nancyloblepharon, where the eye-lid unites with the white of the eye,\r\nour author, after describing the method of cure, immediately adds,\r\n“_Ego sic restitutum neminem memini. Meges se quoque multa_, &c. _i.\r\ne._ I do not remember an instance of any person cured in this way.\r\nMeges also has told us that he has tried many methods, and never was\r\nsuccessful, because the eye-lid always united again to the eye[Q].” The\r\nform of expression here used by our author, in a manner peculiar to\r\na practitioner, would come very improperly from a mere compiler. The\r\nconnection of these two sentences by _quoque_ seems to put our author’s\r\nown observation upon the same footing with that of Meges, whom he\r\nquotes on several occasions as a most accomplished surgeon[R].\r\n\r\n  [P] Lib. iii. c. 5.\r\n\r\n  [Q] Lib. vii. c. 7. See Le Clerc.\r\n\r\n  [R] Though numberless passages will occur in the course of the book,\r\n  where Celsus expressly delivers his own judgment, yet as the reader\r\n  may perhaps chuse to have some of the most remarkable at one view,\r\n  the following references will serve for that purpose. Lib. i. c. 3.\r\n  p. 30. _Neque ignoro_, &c. _Commoneo tamen_, &c. Lib. ii. c. 14. p.\r\n  88. _Quas tamen_, &c. p. 89. _Neque ignoro quosdam_, &c. Lib. iii. c.\r\n  2. p. 140. _Ego tum hoc puto_, &c. c. 14. p. 144. _Tutius tamen_, &c.\r\n  c. 18. p. 150. _Quid igitur est_, &c. Lib. iv. c. 4. p. 200. _Melius\r\n  huic rei_, &c. c. 17. p. 227. _Interdum teretes videmus_, &c. c. 19.\r\n  p. 230. _Ego experimentis_, &c. Lib. vi. c. 4. p. 345. _Sed nihil\r\n  melius est_, &c. Lib. vii. c. 12. p. 446. _Ego autem cognovi_, &c.\r\n  c. 14. p. 450. _Sed abunde est_, &c. Lib. viii. c. 2. p. 509. _Neque\r\n  audiendi_, &c. c. 3. p. 512. _Ut quando os perrumpitur, sentiamus_,\r\n  &c. c. 4. p. 517. _Sed multo melius est_, &c. c. 8. p. 528. _Ex\r\n  dolore colligimus_, &c. c. 13. p. 546. _Ponendum autem hoc esse\r\n  credidi_, &c. Any person, who will be at the pains to examine these\r\n  passages, will easily see, that they strongly support the conclusion\r\n  drawn from the two above recited. [See Linden or Almeloveen’s\r\n  edition.]\r\n\r\nIt may not be amiss, however, to take notice of a distinction Celsus\r\nmakes between two kinds of professors of physic. When he is shewing\r\nthe necessity of circumspection in the physician, he adds, “From[S]\r\nthese things it may be inferred, that many people cannot be attended\r\nby one physician; and that the man to be trusted is he, who knows his\r\nprofession, and is not much absent from the patient. But they, who\r\npractice from views of gain, because their profits rise in proportion\r\nto the number of patients, readily fall in with such rules, as do not\r\nrequire a close attendance, as in this very case. For it is easy for\r\nsuch as seldom see the patient, to count the days and the paroxysms:\r\nbut it is necessary for him to sit by his patient, who would form a\r\ntrue judgment of what is alone fit to be done, when he will be too\r\nweak, unless he get food.” As his censure is so severe upon a practice,\r\nwhich he thought too extensive, it is natural to suppose, that his\r\nwas confined to his acquaintance, and that his fortune and generosity\r\nrendered him superior to the view of living by the profession.\r\n\r\n  [S] Lib. iii. c. 4.\r\n\r\nTo all the later copies of Celsus is prefixed an index of the several\r\neditions, which makes it needless for me to give an account of them.\r\nAll the older ones, printed in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries,\r\nabound with numberless gross errors, that in many places utterly\r\ndestroy the construction. These, Vander Linden undertook to correct,\r\nand the authorities he used for that purpose are contained in a\r\ncatalogue annexed to his preface, in which he tells us he has made very\r\nfew changes from his own conjecture, and none of these, but where the\r\nsubject evidently required them. In the dedication he says, “Who would\r\nimagine, that after the diligent labours of so many illustrious men,\r\nas Egnatius, Cæsarius, Constantine, Stephens, Pantinus, Ronsseus, and\r\nRubeus, I should have corrections to make in more than two thousand\r\nplaces?”\r\n\r\nAs it was proper I should translate from one particular edition, I\r\nchose for that purpose Linden’s; or Almeloveen’s, who has followed\r\nhim almost in every letter; as these are generally esteemed by far\r\nthe most correct: though it must be owned, that Linden has made many\r\nalterations without necessity, and sometimes for the worse. Where the\r\nsense was either obscure or inconsistent with the context, I have\r\noften been assisted by the more ancient editions. On such occasions I\r\nhave given my authority and reasons in the notes. In passages where I\r\nfound a reading in the old copies much preferable to Linden’s, but not\r\naltogether necessary upon account of the sense, I have marked it in a\r\nnote, without adopting it into the next.\r\n\r\nThere are very few places, where I have ventured to alter the reading\r\non my own conjecture, and these are all noted in the margin, where I\r\nhave assigned my reasons, which, I hope, will convince the learned\r\nreader. My notes will shew in how many instances I have been obliged to\r\nthe excellent epistles of Morgagni. This learned and ingenious author\r\nhas, in my opinion, entered more into the spirit and true meaning of\r\nCelsus, than any of the preceding commentators[T].\r\n\r\n  [T] The first three of these epistles were annexed to an edition\r\n  of Celsus, by Vulpius, at Padua, in the year 1722; five more were\r\n  added to another by the same editor in the year 1752; in both which\r\n  editions he has every where followed (only correcting typographical\r\n  errors) the text of Almeloveen.\r\n\r\nHad there been so correct an edition of Celsus, as I think may be made,\r\nwith proper judgment, from the editions and manuscripts extant, it\r\nwould have shortened my labour.\r\n\r\nThat Celsus divided his books into chapters, appears from several\r\npassages: whereas no person, as far as I can find, pretends, that the\r\nmarginal contents came from the author himself. The editions differ\r\nin these; but as it is of small importance, I have not troubled the\r\nreader with any remarks on that article. Where I found those of Linden\r\nevidently wrong, I have endeavoured to supply the defect.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the materia medica, the notes are drawn chiefly from\r\nPliny and Dioscorides, whom I esteemed the best authors on that\r\narticle. When I have given English names to any of the simples, I\r\nfollow the most judicious moderns; though it must be remembered, that\r\nmany of them cannot be determined with absolute certainty.\r\n\r\nThrough most of the compositions the text is miserably corrupted; and\r\nwhat is worse, I do not find, that by comparing the various editions\r\nthis part can be restored. I had once some thoughts of labouring this\r\npoint particularly, but as it would have been expected I should support\r\nevery alteration with proper reasons, and as I despaired of executing\r\nit so, as to meet with universal approbation, and after all it would\r\nhave been more a matter of curiosity than of real use, I omitted that\r\npart of my design; besides, this must have considerably increased the\r\nnumber of my notes, which I have endeavoured should be as few as the\r\nnature of the undertaking would admit of. For these reasons I have\r\nclosely adhered to the text of Linden, without even departing from it,\r\nwhere the nature of the whole composition will evidently demonstrate\r\nthe proportions of several ingredients to be highly incongruous.\r\n\r\nIt has been my principal care to convey the precise meaning of my\r\nauthor, and also to preserve the genius of his style, where the English\r\nidiom would allow. I have likewise been careful not to wrest any\r\nexpression of Celsus, in order to deceive the reader into a greater\r\nopinion of his knowledge, than he really deserves. His merit is\r\nsufficiently great without pretending to find in him any discoveries,\r\nthe honour of which is due to the moderns. Every man of learning, who\r\nis acquainted with the state of physic among the ancients, and knows\r\nhow far it differs from the modern, must be sensible of the difficulty\r\nof translating an author so elegant and concise, with the strictness\r\nnecessary in a work of this nature. Such judges, I hope, will censure\r\nthe faults, which cannot escape their observation, with the candour\r\ninseparable from true criticism.\r\n\r\nIt only remains, that I return thanks to my ingenious and learned\r\nfriends of the faculty, who have favoured me with their opinions on\r\nseveral passages, particularly to Dr. Maghie of Guy’s hospital.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTENTS.\r\n\r\n\r\n  BOOK I.

The Romans divided all integers, as they did their _as_,\r\ninto twelve equal parts called _unciæ_. Thus the _sextans_ was the\r\nsixth part of the _as_, containing _two of these unciæ_, _quadrans_ one\r\nfourth, or _three unciæ_, _triens_ the third part, or _four unciæ_,\r\n_semis_ one half, or _six unciæ_, _bes_ or _bessis_ two-thirds, or\r\n_eight unciæ_, _dodrans_ three-fourths being _nine unciæ_. The weight\r\nof these then differs, as the integer is the _libra_, the _uncia_, or\r\n_denarius_, which the attentive reader will easily reduce, if he is\r\ndisposed to calculate the quantities, observing that they are not to\r\nbe taken for aliquot parts of the denarius, but when they follow the\r\nmark of the denarius. The integer preceding, and the nature of the\r\ncomposition will be the best explication.\r\n\r\nNote 2. The denarius mark was X or Ӿ, as containing originally\r\nten small asses. This by the copiers has been often confounded with X,\r\ndenoting the number of _ten denarii_; so that after all the pains of\r\ncritics and commentators, the proportions of the ingredients in several\r\ncompositions seem to be irrecoverably lost. For this reason, I suppose\r\nthe later editors have thought fit to change it for the common asterisk.\r\n\r\nNote 3. The characters for quantities are variously marked in different\r\nauthors, and the same note has several values. There is one of this\r\nuncertainty in Celsus, that is _Z_, which we are told expresses the\r\n_libra_, the _sescuncia_, the _sextans of a pound_, the _denarius_ and\r\nthe _sextans of a denarius_[W]. Which of these different values it\r\nbears in any particular place must be determined by the connection.\r\nWhen it follows the mark of the _denarius_, it can mean no more than\r\nthe _sextans_ of a _denarius_.\r\n\r\n  [W] Rhodius de Ponderib. et Mensur. Cels.\r\n\r\nNote 4. p. stands for _pondo_, which is an indeclinable word, and when\r\njoined with numbers, signifies _libra_ or a _pound_; when with other\r\nweights, it stands for no more than _pondus_ or _weight in general_.\r\n\r\nFor an example of the reduction of Celsus’s weights to ours, the\r\nfollowing may serve.\r\n\r\nLib. v. cap. 19. no. 7.

CORNELIUS CELSUS\r\n\r\n        OF\r\n\r\n     MEDICINE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_BOOK I._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs agriculture promises food to the healthy, so medicine promises\r\nhealth to the sick. There is no place in the world, where this art is\r\nnot found: for even the most barbarous nations are acquainted with\r\nherbs, and other easy remedies for wounds and diseases. However it has\r\nbeen more improved by the Greeks than any other people: though not\r\nfrom the infancy of that nation, but only a few ages before our own\r\ntimes; as appears by their celebrating Æsculapius as its most ancient\r\nauthor; who, because he cultivated this science with somewhat more\r\naccuracy, which, before him, was rude and of low esteem, was received\r\ninto the number of their gods.(1) After him his two sons, Podalirius\r\nand Machaon, following Agamemnon to the Trojan war, were not a little\r\nuseful to their fellow soldiers. But even these, according to Homer’s\r\naccount, did not undertake the plague, nor the other various kinds of\r\ndiseases, but only cured wounds by incisions, and medicines: from which\r\nit appears, that they entirely confined themselves to the chirurgical\r\npart of medicine, and that this was the most antient branch. From the\r\nsame author we may also learn, that diseases were then believed to\r\narise from the anger of the immortal gods,(2) and that relief used\r\nto be sought from them. It is also probable, that though there were\r\nfew remedies for distempers known, men nevertheless generally enjoyed\r\ngood health from the sobriety of their lives, yet untainted by sloth\r\nand luxury. For these two vices, first in Greece, and then among\r\nus, rendered men liable to many diseases. And hence that variety of\r\nremedies now used, which was neither necessary in ancient times, nor\r\nis yet in other nations, scarcely protracts the lives of a few of us\r\nto the verge of old age. For the same reason, after those, whom I have\r\nmentioned, no men of eminence practised medicine, till learning began\r\nto be pursued with greater application; which, as it is of all things\r\nmost necessary to the mind, so it is no less hurtful to the body. And\r\nat first the science of healing was accounted a branch of philosophy;\r\nso that the cure of diseases, and the study of nature, owed their rise\r\nto the same persons: and for this very good reason, because they, who\r\nhad impaired their bodies by anxious thought, and nightly watchings,\r\nstood most in need of its assistance. And thus we find, that many\r\namongst the philosophers were skilled in this science; of whom the most\r\ncelebrated were Pythagoras, Empedocles, and Democritus. Hippocrates\r\nof Cos, who, according to some authors, was the disciple of the last\r\nmentioned of these, and is so justly admired both for his knowledge in\r\nthis profession, and for his eloquence, was the first worthy of notice,\r\nwho separated medicine from the study of philosophy. After him, Diocles\r\nthe Carystian, then Praxagoras and Chrysippus; after these, Herophilus\r\nand Erasistratus applied themselves to this art, and differed widely\r\nfrom each other in their methods of cure.\r\n\r\n(1) For references 1, 2, 3, &c. see Notes at the end.\r\n\r\nDuring this period, physick was divided into three parts: the\r\nfirst cured by diet, the second by medicines, the third by manual\r\noperations: the first they termed, in Greek, Diætetice,[X] the second\r\nPharmaceutice,[Y] and the third Chirurgice.[Z] The most illustrious\r\nprofessors of that branch, which treats diseases by diet, endeavoured\r\nto extend their views farther, and took in the assistance of natural\r\nphilosophy; being persuaded that, without it, medicine would be a\r\nweak and imperfect science. After these came Serapion, who first\r\nof all maintained, that the rational method of study was foreign to\r\nthe art of medicine, and confined it to practice and experience. In\r\nhis steps followed Appollonius and Glaucias, and some time after\r\nHeraclides of Tarentum, and others of no small note; who, from the\r\ndoctrine they asserted, stiled themselves Empiricks[AA]. And thus the\r\nDietetick branch was also divided into two parts, one set of physicians\r\npursuing theory, the other following experience alone. However, after\r\nthese we have enumerated above, no one attempted any thing new, till\r\nAsclepiades, who greatly changed the art of medicine. And Themison, one\r\nof his successors, has also lately, in his old age, departed from him\r\nin some things. And these are the men, to whom we are chiefly indebted\r\nfor the improvements made in this salutary profession.\r\n\r\n  [X] Διαιτητικὴ.\r\n\r\n  [Y] Φαρμακευτικὴ.\r\n\r\n  [Z] Χειρουργικὴ.\r\n\r\n  [AA] Εμπειρικοὶ.\r\n\r\nAs that branch of medicine, which respects the cure of diseases, is the\r\nnoblest, as well as the most difficult of the three, we shall first\r\ntreat of that part. And because in this the chief dispute is, that some\r\nalledge an acquaintance with experiments to be only requisite, while\r\nothers affirm experience alone to be insufficient, without a thorough\r\nknowledge of the constitution of bodies, and what naturally happens\r\nto them; it will be proper to recite the principal arguments on both\r\nsides, that we may the more easily deliver our own opinion upon the\r\nquestion.\r\n\r\nThose then, who declare for a theory in medicine, look upon the\r\nfollowing things as necessary: the knowledge of the occult and\r\nconstituent causes of distempers; next, of the evident ones; then, of\r\nthe natural actions; and, lastly, of the internal parts. They call\r\nthese causes occult, in which we inquire of what principles our bodies\r\nare composed, what constitutes health, and what sickness. For they\r\nhold it impossible that any one should know how to cure diseases, if\r\nhe be ignorant of the causes, whence they proceed; and that it is not\r\nto be doubted, but one method of cure is required, if the redundancy\r\nor deficiency in any of the four principles(3) be the cause of\r\ndiseases, as some philosophers have affirmed; another, if the fault\r\nlie wholly in the humours, as Herophilus thought; another, if in\r\nthe inspired air, as Hippocrates believed; another, if the blood be\r\ntransfused into those vessels(4), which are designed only for air,\r\nand occasion an inflammation, which the Greeks call phlegmone[AB], and\r\nthat inflammation cause such a commotion as we observe in a fever,\r\nwhich was the opinion of Erasistratus; another, if the corpuscles\r\npassing through the invisible pores should stop, and obstruct the\r\npassage, as Asclepiades maintained: that he will proceed in the proper\r\nmethod of curing a disease, who is not deceived in its original cause.\r\nNor do they deny experience to be necessary, but affirm, it cannot be\r\nobtained without some theory; for that the more ancient practitioners\r\ndid not prescribe any thing, at hazard, for the sick, but considered\r\nwhat was most suitable, and examined that by experience, to which they\r\nhad before been led by some conjecture. That it is of no moment _in\r\nthis argument_, whether most remedies were discovered by experiment,\r\nprovided they were at first applied with some rational view: and that\r\nthis holds in many cases; but new kinds of distempers often occur, in\r\nwhich practice has hitherto given no light; so that it is necessary\r\nto observe whence they arose; without which no mortal can find out,\r\nwhy he should make use of one thing, rather than another. And for\r\nthese reasons they investigate the occult causes. They term those\r\ncauses evident, in which they inquire, whether the beginning of the\r\ndistemper was occasioned by heat or cold, fasting or surfeit, and the\r\nlike. For they say, he will be able to oppose the first appearances,\r\nwho is not ignorant of their rise. Those actions of the body which\r\nthey call natural, are inspiration and exspiration, the reception and\r\nconcoction of our meat and drink, as also the distribution(5) of\r\nthe same into the several parts of the body. They also inquire how it\r\nhappens, that our arteries rise and fall; from what causes proceed\r\nsleep and watching; without the knowledge of which, they conceive it\r\nimpossible for any person either to oppose the beginnings of diseases,\r\nthat depend on these particulars, or cure them when formed. As of\r\nall these things they look upon concoction to be of the greatest\r\nimportance, they insist chiefly upon it; and some of them following\r\nthe opinion of Erasistratus, affirm that the food is concocted in\r\nthe stomach by attrition; others, after Plistonicus, the disciple of\r\nPraxagoras, by putrefaction; others, upon the credit of Hippocrates,\r\nbelieve concoction is effected by heat. After them follow the disciples\r\nof Asclepiades, who hold all these hypotheses to be vain and idle;\r\nfor that there is no concoction at all, but the matter, crude as it\r\nis received, is distributed through the whole body. And in these\r\nthings they are by no means agreed: however, it is not disputed, that\r\naccording to the different hypotheses, a different regimen of diet is\r\nto be observed by sick people. For if it be performed by attrition,\r\nsuch food is to be chosen, as will most easily be broken to pieces; if\r\nby putrefaction, such as most quickly undergoes that change; if heat\r\nbe the cause of concoction, then such as most effectually cherishes\r\nheat. But if there be no concoction at all, then none of these kinds\r\nof aliment are to be chosen: but such are to be taken, as are least\r\nliable to change from the state in which they are received. And, by\r\nthe same way of reasoning, when there is a difficulty of breathing,\r\nwhen sleep or watchings oppress, they are of opinion, that the man,\r\nwho has first learned in what manner these happen, will be capable of\r\ncuring them. Besides, as pains, and various other disorders, attack\r\nthe internal parts, they believe no person can apply proper remedies\r\nto those parts, which he is ignorant of; and therefore, that it is\r\nnecessary to dissect dead bodies, and examine their viscera and\r\nintestines; and that Herophilus and Erasistratus had taken far the best\r\nmethod _for attaining that knowledge_, who procured criminals out of\r\nprison, by royal permission, and dissecting them alive, contemplated,\r\nwhile they were even breathing, the parts, which nature had before\r\nconcealed; considering their position, colour, figure, size, order,\r\nhardness, softness, smoothness, and asperity(6); also the processes\r\nand depressions of each, or what is inserted into, or received by\r\nanother part; for, _say they_, when there happens any inward pain, a\r\nperson cannot discover the seat of that pain, if he have not learned\r\nwhere every viscus or intestine is situated; nor can the part, which\r\nsuffers, be cured by one, who does not know what part it is; and that\r\nwhen the viscera happen to be exposed by a wound, if one is ignorant of\r\nthe natural colour of each part, he cannot know what is sound and what\r\ncorrupted; and for that reason is not qualified to cure the corrupted\r\nparts; besides they maintain, that external remedies are applied with\r\nmuch more judgment, when we are acquainted with the situation, figure,\r\nand size of the internal parts; and that the same reasoning holds in\r\nall the other instances above mentioned. And that it is by no means\r\ncruel, as most people represent it, by the tortures of a few guilty,\r\nto search after remedies for the whole innocent race of mankind in all\r\nages.\r\n\r\n  [AB] Φλεγμονὴ.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, those, who from experience, stile themselves\r\nempiricks, admit indeed the evident causes as necessary; but affirm the\r\ninquiry after the occult causes and natural actions to be fruitless,\r\nbecause nature is incomprehensible. And that these things cannot be\r\ncomprehended, appears from the controversies among those, who have\r\ntreated concerning them, there being no agreement found here either\r\namongst the philosophers or the physicians themselves: for, why should\r\none believe Hippocrates rather than Herophilus? or, why him more than\r\nAsclepiades? that if a man inclines to determine his judgment by\r\nreasons assigned, the reasons of each of them seem not improbable;\r\nif by cures, all of them have restored the diseased to health; and\r\ntherefore we should not deny credit either to the arguments or\r\nauthority of any of them. That even the philosophers must be allowed to\r\nbe the greatest physicians, if reasoning could make them so; whereas\r\nit appears, that they have abundance of words, and very little skill\r\nin the art of healing. _They say also_ that the methods of practice\r\ndiffer according to the nature of places; thus one method is necessary\r\nat Rome, another in Egypt, and another in Gaul. That if the causes of\r\ndistempers were the same in all places, the same remedies ought also\r\nto be used every where. That often too the causes are evident; as for\r\ninstance in a lippitude(7), or a wound, and nevertheless the method\r\nof cure does not appear from them: that if the evident cause does\r\nnot suggest this knowledge, much less can the other, which is itself\r\nobscure. Seeing then this last is uncertain and incomprehensible, it is\r\nmuch better to seek relief from things certain and tried; that is, from\r\nsuch remedies as experience in the method of curing has taught us, as\r\nis done in all other arts; for that neither a husbandman nor a pilot\r\nis qualified for his business by reasoning, but by practice: and that\r\nthese disquisitions have no connection with medicine, may be inferred\r\nfrom this plain fact, that physicians, whose opinions in those matters\r\nhave been directly opposite to one another, have notwithstanding\r\nequally restored their patients to health: that their success was to\r\nbe ascribed to their having derived their methods of cure, not from\r\nthe occult causes, or the natural actions, about which they were\r\ndivided, but from experiments, according as they had succeeded in the\r\ncourse of their practice. That medicine, even in its infancy, was not\r\ndeduced from these inquiries, but from experiments: for of the sick,\r\nwho had no physicians, some from a keen appetite, had immediately\r\ntaken food in the first days of their illness, while others feeling a\r\nnausea, had abstained from it; and that the disorder of those, who had\r\nabstained, was more alleviated; also, some in the paroxysm of a fever\r\nhad taken food, others a little before it came on, and others after its\r\nremission; and that it succeeded best with those who had done it after\r\nthe removal of the fever: in the same manner some used a full diet in\r\nthe beginning of a disease; others were abstemious; and that those\r\ngrew worse, who had eaten plentifully. These and the like instances\r\ndaily occurring, that diligent men observed attentively, what method\r\ngenerally answered best, and afterwards began to prescribe the same to\r\nthe sick. That this was the rise of the art of medicine, which by the\r\nfrequent recovery of some, and the death of others, distinguishes what\r\nis pernicious from what is salutary; and that when the remedies were\r\nfound, men began to discourse about the reasons of them: that medicine\r\nwas not invented in consequence of their reasoning, but the theory\r\nwas sought for after the discovery of medicine. They ask too, whether\r\nreason prescribes the same as experience, or something different; if\r\nthe same, they infer it to be needless, if different, mischievous.\r\nThat at first, however, there was a necessity for examining remedies\r\nwith the greatest accuracy, but now they are sufficiently ascertained;\r\nand that we neither meet with any new kind of disease, nor want any\r\nnew method of cure. That if some unknown distemper should occur, the\r\nphysician would not therefore be obliged to have recourse to the occult\r\nthings; but he would presently see to what distemper it is most nearly\r\nallied, and make trial of remedies like to those, which have often been\r\nsuccessful in a similar malady, and by the resemblance between them\r\nwould find some proper cure. For they do not affirm, that judgment is\r\nnot necessary to a physician, and that an irrational animal is capable\r\nof practising this art; but that those conjectures, which relate to the\r\noccult things, are of no use; because it is no matter what causes, but\r\nwhat removes a distemper: nor is it of any importance in what manner\r\nthe distribution is performed, but what is most easily distributed;\r\nwhether concoction fails from this cause or that; or whether it be\r\nproperly a concoction, or only a distribution: nor are we to inquire\r\nhow we breathe, but what relieves a difficult and slow breathing; nor\r\nwhat is the cause of motion in the arteries, but what each kind of\r\nmotion indicates. That these things are known by experience: that in\r\nall disputes of this kind, a good deal may be said on both sides; and\r\ntherefore genius and eloquence obtain the victory in the dispute; but\r\ndiseases are cured not by eloquence, but by remedies; so that if a\r\nperson, without any eloquence, be well acquainted with those remedies,\r\nthat have been discovered by practice, he will be a much greater\r\nphysician than one who has cultivated his talent in speaking without\r\nexperience. That these things, however, which have been mentioned, are\r\nonly idle: but what remains is also cruel, to cut open the abdomen and\r\npræcordia of living men, and make that art, which presides over the\r\nhealth of mankind, the instrument, not only of inflicting death, but\r\nof doing it in the most horrid manner; especially if it be considered,\r\nthat some of those things, which are sought after with so much\r\nbarbarity, cannot be known at all, and others may be known without\r\nany cruelty; for that the colour, smoothness, softness, hardness,\r\nand such like, are not the same in a wounded body, as they were in\r\na sound; and further, because these qualities, even in bodies that\r\nhave suffered no external violence, are often changed by fear, grief,\r\nhunger, indigestion, fatigue, and a thousand other inconsiderable\r\ndisorders; which makes it much more probable, that the internal parts,\r\nwhich are far more tender, and never exposed to the light itself, are\r\nchanged by the severest wounds and mangling. And that nothing can be\r\nmore ridiculous than to imagine any thing to be the same in a dying\r\nman, nay one already dead, as it is in a living person: for that the\r\nabdomen(8) indeed may be opened(9), while a man breathes; but as\r\nsoon as the knife has reached the præcordia(10), and the transverse\r\nseptum is cut, which by a kind of membrane divides the upper from the\r\nlower parts, (and by the Greeks is called the Diaphragm[AC]) the man\r\nimmediately expires; and thus the præcordia, and all the viscera never\r\ncome into the view of the butchering physician, till the man is dead;\r\nand they must necessarily appear as those of a dead person, and not\r\nas they were while he lived; and thus the physician gains only the\r\nopportunity of murdering a man cruelly, and not of observing, what are\r\nthe appearances of the viscera in a living person: if, however, there\r\nbe any thing which can be observed in a person, that yet breathes,\r\nchance often throws it in the way of such as practise the healing art;\r\nfor that sometimes a gladiator on the stage, a soldier in the field,\r\nor a traveller beset by robbers, is so wounded, that some internal\r\npart, different in different people, may be exposed to view; and thus\r\na prudent physician finds their situation, position, order, figure,\r\nand the other particulars he wants to know, not perpetrating murder,\r\nbut attempting to give health; and learns that, by compassion, which\r\nothers had discovered by horrid cruelty. That for these reasons it is\r\nnot necessary to lacerate even dead bodies; which, though not cruel,\r\nyet may be shocking to the sight, since most things are different in\r\ndead bodies; and even the dressing of wounds shows all that can be\r\ndiscovered in the living.\r\n\r\n  [AC] Διάφραγμα.\r\n\r\nSince these points have often been, and still continue to be disputed\r\nwith great warmth by physicians in large volumes, ’tis proper to add\r\nsome reflections, that may seem to come the nearest to the truth, and\r\nwhich neither slavishly follow either of these opinions, nor are too\r\nremote from both, but lie, as it were, in the middle, betwixt these\r\nopposite extremes; which those, that inquire after truth without\r\npartiality, may find to be the surest method for directing the judgment\r\nin most warm controversies, as well as in this now before us. For,\r\nwith regard to the causes of health or diseases, in what manner the\r\nair, or food, is either conveyed or distributed, the philosophers\r\nthemselves do not attain to an absolute certainty; they only make\r\nprobable conjectures. Now, when there is no certain knowledge of a\r\nthing, a mere opinion about it cannot discover a sure remedy. And it\r\nmust be owned, that nothing is of greater use, even to the rational\r\nmethod of curing, than experience. Altho’ then many things are taken\r\ninto the study of arts, which do not, properly speaking, belong to\r\nthe arts themselves, yet they may greatly improve them by quickening\r\nthe genius of the artist; wherefore the contemplation of nature,\r\nthough it cannot make a man a physician, yet may render him fitter\r\nfor the practice of medicine. Indeed, it is very probable, that both\r\nHippocrates and Erasistratus, and all the others, who were not content\r\nwith treating fevers and ulcers, but examined in some measure into the\r\nnature of things, tho’ they did not by such study become physicians,\r\nyet became more able physicians by that means. And medicine itself\r\nrequires the help of reason, if not always amongst the occult causes,\r\nor the natural actions, yet often; for it is a conjectural art; and\r\nnot only conjecture in many cases, but even experience is found not\r\nconsistent with its rules. And sometimes neither fever, nor appetite,\r\nnor sleep, follow their usual antecedents in the regular course. A new\r\ndistemper sometimes, though very seldom, appears; that such a case\r\nnever happens is manifestly false; for, in our own time, a certain\r\nlady, from a quantity of flesh(11) falling down from her private\r\nparts, and growing dry, expired in a few hours; so that the most\r\ncelebrated physicians neither found out the genus of the distemper,\r\nnor any remedy for it. I suppose the reason they forbore to attempt\r\nany thing was, that none of them was willing to run a risk upon his\r\nown conjecture only in a person of her quality, for fear he should be\r\nthought to have killed, if he did not save her; yet it is probable\r\nthat some one, without that regard to the opinion of the world, might\r\nhave contrived something, which upon trial would have succeeded. Nor\r\nis a similitude always serviceable in this kind of practice; and\r\nwhere it is, this properly belongs to the rational part, to consider\r\namidst a number of similar kinds, both of diseases and remedies, what\r\nparticular medicine ought to be preferred. When such an incident\r\noccurs, the physician ought to invent something, which though perhaps\r\nit does not always answer, yet most commonly may: and he shall draw\r\nhis new method, not from the occult things (for they are dubious and\r\nuncertain) but from those, that can be fully known, that is, from the\r\nevident causes. For it makes a considerable difference, whether the\r\ndistemper was occasioned by fatigue, or thirst, or cold, or heat,\r\nor watching, or hunger; or whether it arose from too much food and\r\nwine, or excess of venery. And he ought not to be ignorant of the\r\nconstitution of his patient, whether his body be too moist, or too dry:\r\nwhether his nerves(12) be strong or weak; whether he be frequently\r\nor seldom ailing; and whether his illnesses are severe or slight, of\r\nlong continuance or short; what way of life he has pursued, laborious\r\nor sedentary, luxurious or frugal; for from these, and such like\r\ncircumstances, he must often draw a new method of cure.\r\n\r\nNevertheless even these things ought not to be so passed over, as\r\nif they were uncontroverted; for Erasistratus has affirmed, that\r\ndistempers were not occasioned by them, because other people, and even\r\nthe same person at different times, would not fall into a fever upon\r\nthem. And some of the Methodists of our own age, from the authority of\r\nThemison (as they would have it thought) assert, that the knowledge of\r\nno cause whatever bears the least relation to the method of cure; and\r\nthat it is sufficient to observe some general symptoms of distempers;\r\nand that there are three kinds of diseases, one bound, another\r\nloose(13), and the third a mixture of these. For that sometimes the\r\nexcretions of sick people are too small, sometimes too large; and\r\nsometimes one particular excretion is deficient, while another is\r\nexcessive. That these kinds of distempers are sometimes acute, and\r\nsometimes chronic; sometimes increasing, sometimes at a stand(14),\r\nand sometimes abating. As soon then as it is known, to which of these\r\nclasses a distemper belongs if the body be bound, it must be opened;\r\nif it labours under a flux, it must be restrained; if the distemper be\r\ncomplicated, then the most urgent malady must be first opposed. And\r\nthat one kind of treatment is required in acute, another in inveterate\r\ndistempers; another, when diseases are increasing; another, when at\r\na stand; and another, when inclining to health. That the observation\r\nof these things constitutes the art of medicine, which they define\r\nas a certain way of proceeding, which the Greeks call _Method_[AD],\r\nand affirm it to be employed in considering those things, that are in\r\ncommon to the same distempers: nor are they willing to have themselves\r\nclassed either with the rationalists, or with those, who regard only\r\nexperiments; for they dissent from the first sect, in that they will\r\nnot allow medicine to consist in forming conjectures about the occult\r\nthings; and also from the other in this, that they hold the observation\r\nof experiments to be a very small part of the art.\r\n\r\n  [AD] Μέθοδος.\r\n\r\nAs to what Erasistratus maintains; in the first place, plain fact\r\ncontradicts his opinion; because a distemper very seldom happens,\r\nunless after some of these occurrences, that have been mentioned. And\r\nthen it does not follow, that what does not affect one person, may not\r\nhurt another; nor what does not affect the same person at one time, may\r\nnot hurt him at another; for there may be some latent circumstances in\r\na body, either in respect of weakness, or some disorder, which either\r\nare not in another, nor were in the same body at a different time;\r\nand these, though of themselves not considerable enough to cause a\r\ndistemper, yet may render a body more liable to other injuries: but if\r\nhe had been sufficiently skilled in the contemplation of the works of\r\nnature (which the physicians with very good reason endeavour to attain)\r\nhe must have known this also, that nothing happens from one single\r\ncause; but that is to be taken for the cause, which seems to have\r\ncontributed most to the effect. Now it is possible, that what does not\r\nmove at all while alone, may in conjunction with other things excite a\r\ngreat commotion. Besides, Erasistratus himself, who says, that a fever\r\narises from a transfusion of the blood into the arteries, and that this\r\nhappens in a plethoric body, can assign no reason, why of two persons\r\nequally plethoric, the one should fall into a distemper, and the other\r\nbe free from all danger, which manifestly happens every day. From hence\r\nit appears, that supposing this transfusion to be real, nevertheless,\r\nwhen there is a plethora, it does not happen of itself, but when some\r\none of the conditions above-mentioned goes along with it.\r\n\r\nBut the followers of Themison, if they assert their maxims to hold\r\nuniversally, are still more rationalists than those, that pass under\r\nthat name; for though one rationalist does not maintain all that\r\nanother approves, there is no necessity to invent a new appellation\r\nfor him; provided, which is the principal thing, he does not proceed\r\nupon memory alone, but takes in reason too. But if, which is nearer\r\nto the truth, the art of medicine hardly admits of any universal\r\nprecepts, then they are in the same class with those, who depend upon\r\nexperiments alone: and the more so, because any unskilful person can\r\ndiscover, whether a distemper has bound up a man, or rendered him\r\nlax. Now if what relaxes a constringed body, or restrains a loose, be\r\ndrawn from reason, such a practitioner is a rational physician: but if\r\nfrom experience, as he must confess, who will not allow himself to be\r\na rationalist, then he is an empirick. And so, according to him, the\r\nknowledge of the distemper is foreign to the art, but the remedy lies\r\nwithin the bounds of experience. Nor is any improvement made by them\r\nupon the profession of the empiricks, but on the contrary, something\r\nis taken from it; the empiricks attending with great circumspection to\r\nmany circumstances; whereas these regard only the easiest, and no more\r\nthan the common things. For in like manner those, who are employed in\r\ncuring cattle, since it is impossible for them to be informed by the\r\ndumb animals, what is peculiar in the case of each, regard only what\r\nis common to them all: and foreign nations, as they are not acquainted\r\nwith any subtile theory of medicine, take notice only of the common\r\nsymptoms: those also, who take under their care a great number of\r\npatients, because they are not able to consult the distinct necessities\r\nof each with the utmost attention, have respect only to those generals.\r\nNor indeed were the ancient physicians ignorant of this method, but\r\nthey were not content with it; for even the most ancient writer\r\nHippocrates said, that in practice it is necessary to regard both the\r\ngeneral and peculiar circumstances. Nor is it possible even for them to\r\nconfine themselves within the narrow limits of their own profession;\r\nfor there are different kinds both of the bound, and lax disorders;\r\nwhich is more easily observed in the lax, for it is one thing to vomit\r\nblood, another to vomit bile, and another to vomit the food: and\r\nthere is also a difference betwixt labouring under a simple purging,\r\nand a dysentery; between being weakened by sweats, and wasted by a\r\nconsumption. A humour also breaks out upon particular parts, as the\r\neyes, for instance, and the ears; and no member of the human body is\r\nfree from that danger. Now not one of these disorders is cured exactly\r\nin the same manner as another; so that in these, medicine descends from\r\nthe general observation of the lax kind, to the peculiar. And in this\r\nagain another kind of knowledge of peculiarity is often necessary;\r\nbecause the same thing will not relieve all, that labour under similar\r\ndistempers. For though there are certain things, which either bind\r\nthe belly, or open it in most people; yet some are to be met with, in\r\nwhom the same intention is gained by means contrary to the common. So\r\nthat in such, the general observation is hurtful, and the peculiar\r\nonly salutary. And a right apprehension of the cause often removes a\r\ndistemper. Upon this account it was, that the most ingenious physician\r\nof our age, the late Cassius, being called to one in a fever distressed\r\nwith violent thirst, when he found, that his complaints began after\r\nhard drinking, ordered him to drink plentifully of cold water. When\r\nhis patient had drank this, and by the mixture had weakened the force\r\nof the wine, he was presently freed from the fever by a sleep, and a\r\nsweat. Which remedy the physician very judiciously adapted to the case,\r\nnot from the consideration of his body being either bound or loose, but\r\nfrom the cause that had preceded. There is also another peculiarity\r\nto be regarded, which is that of place and season, according to these\r\nauthors themselves; who, when they are giving directions for the\r\nmanagement of the healthy, order them more carefully to avoid cold,\r\nheat, satiety, labour, and venery, in sickly places or seasons; and\r\nto take more rest in such seasons or places, if they have any sense\r\nof weight hanging upon their body; and in such circumstances neither\r\nto disturb the stomach by vomiting, nor the belly by purging. These\r\nthings indeed are certain; yet they descend from generals to some\r\nthings that are particular: unless they would have us believe, that\r\nhealthy men should observe the temper of the air, and the season of\r\nthe year, and that sick people don’t need to take that care, to whom\r\nall precaution is so much the more necessary, by how much an infirm\r\nstate of health is more liable to receive injury. Besides, there are\r\nvery different properties of distempers in the same person. And one,\r\nwho has been sometimes unsuccessfully tried by medicines, which seemed\r\nproper for his disorder, is often recovered by the contrary. There are\r\nalso many distinctions to be observed in the giving of food, of which\r\nI shall only name one instance. A youth bears hunger more easily than\r\na boy; better in a thick, than a clear air; more easily in winter than\r\nsummer; with more ease, one, that is accustomed to a single meal, than\r\nanother, who eats a dinner also(15); a sedentary person more easily,\r\nthan one that takes exercise. Now generally food ought to be prescribed\r\nso much the sooner, as the person is less able to bear the want of it\r\nin health. For these reasons I am apt to think, that he, who is not\r\nacquainted with the peculiarities, ought only to consider the general:\r\nand that he, who can find out the peculiar, ought not to neglect, but\r\ntake them in too for the direction of his practice. And therefore,\r\nwhere the knowledge is equal, yet a friend is a more useful physician,\r\nthan a stranger. To return to my point then, my opinion is, that\r\nmedicine ought to be rational, but to draw its methods from the evident\r\ncauses, all the obscure being removed, not from the attention of the\r\nartist, but from the practice of the art. Again, to dissect the bodies\r\nof living men is both cruel and superfluous. But the dissection of dead\r\nsubjects is necessary for learners: for they ought to know the position\r\nand order of the parts, which dead bodies will show better, than a\r\nliving and wounded man. But as for the other things, which can only be\r\nobserved in living bodies, practice itself will discover them in the\r\ncure of the wounded, somewhat more slowly, but with more tenderness.\r\nHaving delivered my sentiments upon these points, I shall lay down the\r\nproper rules for the management of people in health, and then proceed\r\nto what relates to diseases and their cure.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. I.\r\n\r\nRULES FOR THE HEALTHY.\r\n\r\n\r\nA sound man, who is both in health, and his own master, ought to\r\nconfine himself to no rules; and neither call for the assistance of a\r\nphysician nor an iatroalipta(16). ’Tis good for him to diversify his\r\nway of life; to be sometimes in the country, sometimes in the city,\r\nand frequently in the fields; to sail, to hunt; sometimes to rest,\r\nbut exercise himself frequently: for indolence enervates the body,\r\nlabour strengthens it: the first brings on a quick old age, the other\r\nmakes a long youth. ’Tis also proper to make use sometimes of the\r\nwarm bath(17), and sometimes of the cold; to anoint sometimes, and\r\nat other times to neglect it; to avoid no kind of food, that may be\r\nin common use; sometimes to eat in company, at other times to retire\r\nfrom it; sometimes to eat more than is sufficient, and at other times\r\nno more; to take food rather twice in the day than once; and always\r\nas much as he can, provided he concoct it. But as exercise and food\r\nof this kind are necessary, so the exercise and diet of wrestlers are\r\ninconvenient: both because the order of exercise being interrupted by\r\nsome necessary business of life, hurts the body; and because those\r\nbodies, which are very high fed, like their’s, soonest decay, and are\r\nmost liable to diseases.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Of Coition._]\r\n\r\nCoition is neither to be too much desired, nor too much feared. Seldom\r\nused, it excites the body; frequent, relaxes. But as the frequency\r\nis to be judged of, not by the number of repetitions, but by nature,\r\nregard being had to the age and constitution, we may know it not to\r\nbe useless, when it is neither followed by a languor of the body, nor\r\npain. It is worse in the day-time, but safer in the night; _but the\r\ngeneral rule will hold for both_, if neither meat be taken after the\r\nfirst, nor the other be followed by wakefulness and labour. These\r\nthings are to be observed by strong people; and care must be taken,\r\nthat the reliefs of sickness be not wasted in good health.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. II.\r\n\r\nRULES FOR VALETUDINARY PEOPLE.\r\n\r\n\r\nBut greater precaution is necessary for the valetudinary; amongst\r\nwhom are the greatest number of those that live in cities, and almost\r\nall that are fond of study: that care may rectify the disorders which\r\narise from their constitution, situation, or study. Any of these\r\nthen, who has concocted well, will rise in the morning safely; he\r\nthat finds the concoction not completed, ought to lie still; and if\r\nhe be under a necessity of rising, to go to sleep afterwards. He that\r\nhas not concocted at all, should be entirely at rest, and neither\r\nventure upon labour, nor exercise, nor business. He that is troubled\r\nwith crude belching, without pain of the præcordia, ought now and\r\nthen to drink cold water, and withal to confine himself to certain\r\nrules; to live in a house well lighted, that enjoys the summer’s\r\nbreeze and the winter’s sun; to avoid the meridian sun, the morning\r\nand evening cold, as also the air of rivers and lakes; and by no means\r\nto expose himself to the sun breaking out in a cloudy sky, lest he\r\nbe sometimes affected with heat, and sometimes with cold, which very\r\noften occasions gravedoes(18) and catarrhs. These inconveniences\r\nare to be guarded against with greater diligence in sickly places,\r\nin which they even cause a pestilence. We may know a body to be in\r\nhealth, when every day in the morning the urine is first white, and\r\nthen of a light red colour: the first shows that the concoction is\r\ngoing on, and the other, that it is compleated. When any person awakes,\r\nhe ought to wait a little, and then, unless it be the winter time, to\r\nwash his mouth plentifully with cold water; in long days, to take the\r\nair in the middle of the day, before meat; or, if he cannot do that\r\nconveniently, after it. In winter especially, to rest the whole night;\r\nbut, if he is obliged to study in the night, to do it not immediately\r\nafter eating, but after concoction. He, that in the day-time has been\r\nemployed either in domestic or civil business, ought to set apart some\r\ntime for the refreshment of his body; the principal part of which\r\nis exercise, which ought always to go before meat: in one that has\r\nlaboured little(19), and has concocted well, it should be stronger;\r\nin one who has been fatigued, and has not concocted well, it may be\r\nmore gentle. Proper exercises are, reading aloud, handling of arms, the\r\nball, running, and walking; which last is better not upon plain ground:\r\nfor an ascent and descent agitates the body with some variety, unless\r\nit be very weak. And it is better in the open air, than in a portico;\r\nbetter in the sun, if the head can bear it, than in a shade; better\r\nin a shade formed by walls, or parks, than under a roof; a straight\r\nwalk is better than a winding. In most cases a beginning sweat should\r\nput an end to exercise, or at least lassitude, that does not amount to\r\nfatigue; and that sometimes in a less, sometimes in a greater degree.\r\nIn all these exercises, there should neither be, as among wrestlers, an\r\ninviolable rule, nor too violent labour. Exercise is rightly followed,\r\nsometimes by unction, either in the sun, or before a fire, at other\r\ntimes by the bath, which is best in a room as high, light, and spacious\r\nas may be. Neither of these should be always done; but either one of\r\nthem oftner than the other, as agrees best with the constitution. After\r\nthese, it is necessary to take some rest. When food is to be taken, it\r\nis never proper to overload: but too great abstinence is often hurtful:\r\nif there be any small excess committed, it is often safer in drinking\r\nthan eating. It is best to begin with salt fish(20), greens, and\r\nsuch like. After these flesh, which is best roasted, or boiled. All\r\npreserves, upon a double account, are hurtful, both because people are\r\ntempted by their agreeable taste to exceed in quantity, and though the\r\nquantity be moderate, they are of difficult concoction. A desert is not\r\nhurtful to a good stomach, but turns sour upon a weak. And therefore\r\none, that is less firm in that part, will do better to use dates,\r\napples, and such fruit for that purpose. After drinking somewhat more\r\nthan thirst requires, no more should be eaten. With a full stomach\r\na man should set about no action. When one has eat plentifully, the\r\nconcoction is more easy, if he concludes the meal with a drink of cold\r\nwater, then continues awake for a little while, and afterwards has a\r\nsound sleep. If a person has made a hearty meal in the day-time, he\r\nought not to expose himself after it, either to cold, heat, or labour;\r\nfor these do not so readily hurt with an empty as a full body. If\r\nupon any occasion one is to want food for a time, all labour is to be\r\navoided.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. III.\r\n\r\n SOME OBSERVATIONS SUITED TO NEW INCIDENTS, AND THE DIFFERENT\r\n CONSTITUTIONS, SEXES, AND AGES, AND THE SEASONS OF THE YEAR.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat we have delivered above, is nearly of universal extent: but some\r\nprecautions are necessary for new incidents, and for the constitutions,\r\nsexes(21), and ages, and the seasons of the year. For it is neither\r\nvery safe to remove from a healthy place into a sickly; nor from a\r\nsickly into a healthy. It is best to remove from a healthy place to a\r\nsickly, in the beginning of winter; from a sickly to a healthy, in the\r\nbeginning of summer. It is neither fit to overload with food after much\r\nfasting, nor is fasting good after too full eating. And those persons\r\nendanger themselves, who, contrary to their custom, either once or\r\ntwice a day eat immoderately. Again, sudden ease is very hurtful after\r\ngreat labour, and sudden labour after too great inactivity. For this\r\nreason, when one has a mind to make any change in his way of living,\r\nhe must accustom himself to it gradually. All kinds of labour are more\r\neasily endured even by a boy or an old man, than by a man that is not\r\nused to it. And upon this account too, a life over inactive is not\r\ngood; because there may happen to be a necessity for labour. But if at\r\nany time a person altogether unused has occasionally laboured, or even\r\none, that is accustomed to it, has laboured much harder than ordinary,\r\nhe ought to sleep with an empty stomach; and so much the rather, if\r\nhe have a bitter taste in his mouth, or a dimness in his eyes, or his\r\nbelly be disordered, For then he must not only sleep with an empty\r\nstomach, but even continue to fast the following day, unless rest has\r\nquickly carried off the disorder. And if that be the case, he should\r\nget up, and walk a little at a slow pace. But if a person has been\r\nat more moderate labour, so that he was not obliged to go to sleep,\r\nnevertheless he ought to walk in the same manner.\r\n\r\nWhat follows is to be generally observed by those, that after fatigue\r\nare to eat: when they have walked a little, if they have not an\r\nopportunity of bathing, they ought to be anointed in a warm place,\r\neither in the sun, or before a fire, and then to sweat. But if they\r\nhave that conveniency, they should first of all sit down in the\r\ntepidarium; next, after they have rested a little, go down into the\r\nwarm bath; then anoint with a good deal of oil, and rub gently, and\r\nagain go into the bath; this done wash the mouth with warm water,\r\nand then with cold. A very hot bath is not fit for such people. And\r\ntherefore if any one is so much over fatigued as to be feverish, it is\r\nsufficient for him, in a tepid room, to dip himself up to the groin in\r\nwarm water, with a small mixture of oil: after that, to rub over the\r\nwhole body, but principally those parts, that have been in the water,\r\nwith oil, in which there is an addition of wine and a little powdered\r\nsalt. Afterwards it is proper for all people, that are fatigued, to\r\ntake food, and that of a moist nature; to be content either with water,\r\nor at most a diluted drink, especially such as is diuretic. It is fit\r\nalso to know this, that drinking cold water is very pernicious to one,\r\nthat is sweating by labour; and hurtful to those, that are fatigued by\r\na journey, even when the sweat has abated. Asclepiades believed it to\r\nbe bad for those too, that had immediately come from the bath. This\r\nholds true in those, who are easily purged, but not with safety, and\r\nare liable to shudderings, but is not universal; because it is most\r\nagreeable to nature, that a hot stomach should be cooled by drinking,\r\nand a cold one heated. Which rule when I lay down, I own at the same\r\ntime, that cold water should not be given to one, that is in a sweat,\r\nthough occasioned by bathing. It is common also after various food,\r\nand frequent diluted drinks, for a vomit to be serviceable, and the\r\nfollowing day a long rest, and then gentle exercise. If one be troubled\r\nwith frequent yawning(22), he should drink wine and water by turns,\r\nand seldom make use of the bath. A change of labour also relieves from\r\nfatigue; and when any person is distressed by some unusual kind of\r\nlabour, that which he is accustomed to, refreshes him. It is very safe\r\nfor a person, who is fatigued, to rest upon a couch, if he has before\r\nmade it a daily practice; on the contrary, it wearies one, that is not\r\nused to it. For whatever is contrary to custom proves hurtful, whether\r\nit be indulgence or severity.\r\n\r\nThere are some methods peculiarly adapted to the case of a man fatigued\r\nby walking. Frequent friction, even upon the journey, relieves him; at\r\nthe end of the journey first sitting down, and then unction; afterwards\r\nhe may foment with warm water, or use the warm bath, rather to his\r\nlower, than his upper parts. But if any one has been scorched in the\r\nsun, he must immediately go to the bagnio, and rub over his body\r\nand head with oil, and then go down into the bath, warmed to a good\r\ndegree; after that, first warm water must be poured over the head, and\r\nthen cold. But he, that has been chilled with cold, must wrap himself\r\nup, and sit down in the laconicum, till he sweat; then anoint, and\r\nafterwards bathe; eat moderately, and drink wine unmixed.\r\n\r\nHe that has been upon sea, and is troubled with a nausea, if he has\r\nvomited much bile, ought to abstain from food wholly, or take very\r\nlittle: if he has brought up acid phlegm, he may notwithstanding\r\ntake food, but lighter than ordinary: if he has had a nausea without\r\nvomiting, he should abstain from food, or take a vomit after meat. He\r\nthat has sat the whole day, either in a chariot or in the theatre,\r\nshould by no means run, but walk slowly. It has been frequently\r\nserviceable to stay a long while in the bath, and then to sup slightly.\r\nIf one grows hot in the bath, it will refresh him to take vinegar, and\r\nhold it in his mouth: if that is not at hand, cold water may be used in\r\nthe same manner. Above all things it is proper to know the constitution\r\nof the body: because some are slender, others fat; some hot, others\r\ncold; some moist, others dry; some costive, and others lax. There are\r\nvery few instances of men, who have not a weakness in some part or\r\nother of their body. A person of a slender habit should take methods\r\nto gain flesh, one of a plethoric should diminish his bulk; one of a\r\nhot temperament ought to cool himself, the cold to warm him; one of a\r\nhumid should dry, and one of a dry should moisten; he that is loose in\r\nthe belly should harden it, and he that is bound should relax; and in\r\ngeneral, means must always be used to help that part which is most\r\nliable to disorders.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _The means of fattening the body._]\r\n\r\nThe body is fattened by gentle exercise, frequent rest, unction, and\r\nthe warm bath, if it be after dinner; a costive belly, moderate cold in\r\nthe winter, a full sleep, but not over long, a soft couch, tranquillity\r\nof mind, the eating and drinking of sweet and fat things, frequent\r\nmeals, and as much food as it is possible to digest.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Of extenuating the body._]\r\n\r\nThe body is extenuated by going into warm water(23), and especially\r\nif it be salt, the bath with an empty stomach, a scorching sun, and all\r\nheat, care, watching, either too short or too long sleep; lying upon\r\nthe ground in the summer time, and upon a hard couch in the winter;\r\nrunning, much walking, and all violent exercise, vomiting, purging,\r\nacid and austere things, and a single meal in the day, also a custom of\r\ndrinking wine, that’s not very cold, upon an empty stomach.\r\n\r\nSince I have classed vomiting and purging amongst the methods for\r\nextenuating, I must say something in particular about them. I observe,\r\nthat vomiting is rejected by Asclepiades in that book, which he\r\ncomposed upon the preservation of health; nor do I blame him, if he\r\nwas offended with the custom of those, who by such daily evacuation\r\nendeavour to procure a voracious appetite. But he has gone something\r\nfarther. He has also in the same book forbid purging. And indeed\r\nthis is hurtful, if it be procured by too strong medicines. It can\r\nbe no universal maxim however, that these should be laid aside\r\nentirely; because it is possible, that the nature of constitutions\r\nand particular junctures may make them necessary, provided they be\r\nused with moderation, and not without necessity; and even he himself\r\nhas granted, that if any thing be corrupted, it ought to be expelled.\r\nSo that this method is not to be altogether condemned, but there may\r\nbe many occasions for it, and it requires a more particular and nice\r\nobservation.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Of vomits._]\r\n\r\nA vomit is more useful in the winter than summer, because in that\r\nseason there is more phlegm, and a greater heaviness in the head. It\r\ndoes no good to those, that are slender, and have a weak stomach;\r\nbut it is useful to those, that are of a full habit, and all bilious\r\npeople, if they have either overloaded themselves, or their concoction\r\nhas been impaired: for if they have taken a greater quantity than\r\ncan be concocted, they ought not to run the risk of its corrupting;\r\nor if it is already corrupted, nothing is more proper than to have\r\nit expelled in the most expeditious way possible. For this reason,\r\nwhenever they are attacked with bitter eructations, attended with pain\r\nand weight of the præcordia, they must immediately have recourse to\r\nthis remedy. It is likewise proper for one, who has a scorching heat\r\nin the breast, and a frequent spitting or a nausea, or for one who\r\nhas noise in his ears, or a humour in the eyes, or a bitterness in\r\nthe mouth; as also for one, who changes either his air or situation,\r\nand to those, who are troubled with a pain of the præcordia, if they\r\nhave not vomited for several days. I am sensible, that in these cases\r\nrest is prescribed, which cannot always be had by those, who are under\r\na necessity of stirring about; nor indeed has it the same effect in\r\nevery body. I grant then, that vomits should not be taken with a\r\nview of indulging the luxurious appetite: that they are sometimes\r\nuseful remedies, I believe upon the credit of experience; but I would\r\nadvise any, who wishes to be healthy, and live to old age, not to\r\nmake a daily practice of it. When one chuses to vomit after meat, if\r\nhe does it easily, he should first drink only warm water; if with\r\ndifficulty, let him add a little salt or honey to the water; but he,\r\nthat intends to vomit in the morning, should first drink mulse(24),\r\nor eat hyssop(25), or radish, and then drink warm water, as has been\r\ndirected already. All the other things which the ancient physicians\r\nprescribed, are hurtful to the stomach. If it is weak after the vomit,\r\na little food is to be taken, but of a proper kind; and if the fauces\r\nhave been much irritated, three cyathi of cold water may be drunk. He,\r\nthat has vomited, if it was in the morning, ought to take a walk, then\r\nanoint, afterwards sup; but if after supper, on the following day he\r\nshould bathe, and sweat in the bagnio; he will do well to make the next\r\nmeal slight, and the bread he uses at it should be stale, wine austere\r\nand unmixed, the flesh roasted, and all the food of the driest kind.\r\nHe that chuses to vomit twice in the month, will find it answer the\r\npurpose better, if he do it for two days successively, than if he were\r\nto repeat it on the fifteenth day, unless such an intermission should\r\ncause a weight at his breast.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Of purging._]\r\n\r\nWhen the belly is costive, so as to evacuate very sparingly, and from\r\nthat cause flatulencies, dimness of sight, pains of the head, and other\r\ndisorders of the superior parts, grow troublesome, then ’tis fit to\r\ntake a purge: for what assistance can rest or abstinence afford in\r\nthese disorders, of which they are the principal causes? He that wants\r\nto be lax, let him first use such food and wine as produce that effect:\r\nand if they don’t succeed, let him take aloes. But purging, though it\r\nbe sometimes necessary, yet, when it is frequent, becomes dangerous;\r\nfor thus the body will be habitually deprived of its nourishment, and\r\nby that means become valetudinary, for a body in a weak state is the\r\nmost liable to all kinds of distempers.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _What heats and cools the body._]\r\n\r\nThe body is heated by unction, salt water, and more so if it be warm;\r\nall salt provisions, and austere wine. On the contrary, it is cooled\r\nby bitter and fleshy substances, taken with an empty stomach; the bath\r\nafter meals, and sleep, unless it be too long, and all acids; the\r\ncoldest water; oil, if it be mixed with water; and lotus(26).\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _What moistens and dries the body._]\r\n\r\nThe body is rendered humid(27) by less exercise than ordinary,\r\nfrequent bathing, a full diet, much drink, a walk after it, and\r\ncontinuing awake. Walking long, and briskly, has of itself the same\r\ntendency; and morning exercise, if one does not eat presently after\r\nit; and those kinds of food, which come from cold climates, or rainy,\r\nor otherwise damp. On the contrary, dryness is caused by immoderate\r\nexercise, hunger, unction, heat without moisture, immoderate use of\r\nsalt, cold water, and the taking of food immediately after exercise,\r\nand such particularly as comes from dry and hot climates.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _What binds and relaxes the belly._]\r\n\r\nThe belly is bound by labour, sitting still, rubbing potter’s chalk\r\nupon the body, and by diminishing the usual quantity of food, as also\r\nif it be taken but once a day by one who is accustomed to it twice; by\r\ndrinking little, and not till one has eat as much, as he designs for\r\nthe time; rest after meat. On the other hand, the belly is relaxed\r\nby an increase of walking and food, motion after meat, and drinking\r\nfrequently in the time of meals. ’Tis necessary also to know this that\r\na loose belly is bound by a vomit, and a costive one is loosened by the\r\nsame: and a vomit immediately after meat binds it; but one that comes\r\nsome time after, renders it lax.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Of the different ages_.]\r\n\r\nAs to the different ages, people in middle life bear want of food most\r\neasily; young men not so well; least of all boys, and very old men.\r\nThe more uneasiness one finds from it, he ought to take victuals the\r\noftener; and that frequency is more especially necessary for one, that\r\nis growing. Warm bathing is fit both for boys and old men. Wine should\r\nbe given to boys more diluted, to old men less; but such as occasions\r\nflatulencies, to neither of them. It is of less consequence what\r\nvictuals young men eat, and how dressed. Those that are loose in the\r\nbelly while young, for the most part are costive when they grow old;\r\nsuch as are costive, in their youth, are often loose in old age. It\r\nis best for a young man to have a lax belly, and for an old man to be\r\nbound.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Of the seasons. Winter._]\r\n\r\nIt is necessary also to consider the seasons of the year. It is proper\r\nto eat more in the winter; to take a smaller quantity of drink, but\r\nless diluted; to make much use of bread, and flesh rather boiled\r\n_than roasted_, and greens sparingly; to take food once a day, unless\r\nthe belly be too much bound. If one dines, it is better to take some\r\ntrifling thing, and that dry, without flesh, and without drink. In that\r\nseason of the year, all warm things, or such as promote heat, are best.\r\nNor is venery altogether so hurtful then, as at some other times.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Spring._]\r\n\r\nBut in the spring the quantity of food is to be lessened, and the\r\ndrink increased, but more diluted; more use is to be made of flesh and\r\ngreens, and there must be a gradual change from boiled to roast flesh.\r\nVenery is most safe in that season of the year.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Summer._]\r\n\r\nBut in summer the body requires meat and drink more frequently;\r\ntherefore it is convenient to take a dinner. Flesh and greens are most\r\nproper in that season; drink very much diluted, that it may at once\r\nremove thirst, and not inflame the body; bathing in cold water; roast\r\nflesh, cold food, or such as is cooling. As food must be often taken,\r\nso it must be in small quantities.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Autumn._]\r\n\r\nNow in autumn there is the greatest danger, upon account of the\r\nfrequent changes of the air. And for this reason one should never go\r\nabroad, especially in the colder days, without warm cloaths and shoes,\r\nnor sleep in the air in the night-time, or at least be well covered.\r\nAt this time the diet may be something more full, the drink less, but\r\nstronger. Some imagine apples(28) to be hurtful, which for the most\r\npart are eaten immoderately through the whole day, while no abatement\r\nis made from the more substantial food. Thus the mischief does not\r\nproceed from them, but from the aggregate of all that is taken; for\r\nnone of them contribute less to it than these. But it is not fit to\r\nuse them oftener than the other kinds. Lastly, it is necessary when\r\nan addition is made in this article, to lessen the quantity of the\r\nstronger food. Venery is neither good in the summer, nor in autumn; but\r\nis less hurtful in autumn; in summer, if possible, there ought to be a\r\ntotal abstinence from it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. IV.\r\n\r\nRULES FOR THOSE THAT HAVE A WEAKNESS IN THE HEAD.\r\n\r\n\r\nOur next business is to consider the cases of those, who have a\r\nweakness in any particular part of the body. He, that has a weakness\r\nin his head, if he has concocted well, ought to rub it gently with\r\nhis hands in the morning; and never, if he can avoid it, put any\r\ncovering upon it, or clip the hair close to the skin; it is proper for\r\nhim to avoid exposing it to the moon, and more especially before her\r\nconjunction with the sun, but never to go out after meat: if he have\r\nhis hair, to comb it every day; to walk much, but if he can, neither\r\nunder a roof, nor in the sun; and also to avoid the scorching heat\r\nof the sun, particularly after meat or wine. He should rather anoint\r\nthan bathe, and the unction should be performed, never before a flame,\r\nsometimes at a glowing red fire. If he come to the bath, he ought first\r\nto wrap himself up, and sweat a little in the tepidarium, anoint there,\r\nand then go into the calidarium; when he has sweat, not to go into the\r\nbath, but to pour hot water over his head, so that it may run over all\r\nhis body, then tepid water in the same manner, and lastly cold; and\r\nthe last longer upon his head than the other parts; after which to rub\r\nit for some time; lastly, to dry and anoint. Nothing is so beneficial\r\nto the head as cold water; for this reason, he that has a weak head,\r\nshould every day in the summer hold it for some time under a pretty\r\nstrong stream. And though he has anointed without going into the bath,\r\nand is not able to bear dipping in cold water, nevertheless he should\r\nalways pour cold water upon his head. But when he is unwilling to have\r\nthe other parts of his body touched, he must bend his head forward, so\r\nthat the water may not fall down into his neck; and that it may not\r\noffend his eyes, or any other part, he is to throw it back now and then\r\nwith his hands, as it runs down. It is necessary for him to use a spare\r\ndiet, which is easily concocted; and if he finds his head uneasy, when\r\nhis stomach is empty, he must eat in the middle of the day; if fasting\r\ndoes not injure it, once a day is more eligible. Mild diluted wine is\r\nmore proper for his common drink than water, that when his head grows\r\nworse, he may have some refuge left; and it is neither fit for him\r\nto drink wine always, nor water; each of them is a remedy, when used\r\nalternately. He must neither write nor read, nor speak with vehemence,\r\nespecially after supper; at which time neither is thinking very safe\r\nfor him; but above all things a vomit is hurtful.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. V.\r\n\r\n DIRECTIONS FOR THOSE THAT LABOUR UNDER A LIPPITUDE, GRAVEDO, CATARRH,\r\n AND DISORDERS OF THE TONSILS.\r\n\r\n\r\nNor is the use of cold water beneficial to those only, who are\r\ndistressed with a weakness in their head; but also to such as are\r\ntroubled with constant lippitudes, or gravedoes, catarrhs, and\r\ndisorders in their tonsils. Such people must not only pour cold water\r\nupon their head every day, but also wash their mouth with a large\r\nquantity of it; and all, that find relief from this practice, must\r\nespecially make use of it, when the air has been rendered unwholesome\r\nby southerly winds. And as all strong attention or fatigue of mind\r\nafter meat is hurtful to every body, so it is more particularly to\r\nthose, who are liable to pains in their head, or windpipe, or any other\r\ndisorders in their mouth. A person subject to gravedoes and catarrhs,\r\nmay avoid these disorders by changing his air, place, or water, as\r\nlittle as possible; and by covering his head in the sun, so as it may\r\nneither be overheated, nor suffer by cold from the sudden intervention\r\nof a cloud; by shaving his head with an empty stomach after concoction,\r\nand neither reading nor writing after meat.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. VI.\r\n\r\nTHE PROPER REGIMEN FOR PEOPLE LIABLE TO A PURGING.\r\n\r\n\r\nHe, that is frequently troubled with a purging, ought to exercise his\r\nupper parts by the ball, and such like motions; to walk, while his\r\nstomach is empty; to avoid too great heat from the sun, and constant\r\nbathing; to anoint without sweating. He should not use a variety of\r\nfood, and by no means meat stewed into broth, or vegetables of the\r\nleguminous kind, or those greens that pass quickly through the body;\r\nin fine, to take all such things as are slowly concocted. Venison,\r\nhard fish, and the roasted flesh of tame animals, are very proper. It\r\nis never fit to drink salt wine(29), nor even the weak, nor sweet\r\nwine, but the austere, of a strong body, and not over old. If he chuses\r\nmulse, it must be prepared with boiled honey. If cold drinks don’t\r\ndisturb his belly, he must use them principally. If any thing has\r\ndisagreed with him at supper, he ought to vomit, and to repeat it the\r\nday following; on the third day to eat a small quantity of bread dipped\r\nin wine, or eggs fried in oil, or in defrutum(30), and things of a\r\nlike nature: after that to return to his usual diet. After meat always\r\nto rest, and neither apply his thoughts to any subject closely, nor\r\ngive himself a shock by walking however gently.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. VII.\r\n\r\nRULES FOR THOSE THAT ARE LIABLE TO A PAIN OF THE COLON.\r\n\r\n\r\nBut if the large intestine, which is called colon[AE], is often pained,\r\nsince that disorder is nothing else but a kind of flatulence, the\r\nintention to be pursued is, that concoction may be duly performed; the\r\npatient must practise reading, and other exercises, make use of the hot\r\nbath, and take his food and drink hot; lastly, let him avoid cold by\r\nall means, every thing that is sweet, and leguminous vegetables, and\r\nwhatever generally causes flatulencies.\r\n\r\n  [AE] κόλον.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. VIII.\r\n\r\nRULES FOR ONE THAT HAS A WEAK STOMACH.\r\n\r\n\r\nA man, whose stomach is infirm, ought to read aloud, after reading to\r\nwalk, then to exercise himself with the ball or arms, or any other\r\nkind, which agitates the superior parts; upon an empty stomach, not\r\nto drink water, but hot wine; to take food twice a day, but in such\r\nquantity, as he can easily concoct; to make use of small and austere\r\nwine, and to take his drink after meat rather cold. The indications of\r\na weak stomach are paleness, leanness, pain in the præcordia, nausea,\r\ninvoluntary vomiting, a pain of the head, when the stomach is empty:\r\nwhere these signs are not found, the stomach is strong. And we are not\r\nto believe our countrymen, who, when they are indisposed, and have\r\na strong inclination for wine or cold water, defend their luxury by\r\npretending the stomach does not do its office. But those that concoct\r\nslowly, and whose præcordia on that account are inflated, or who, by\r\nreason of any heat, are accustomed to be thirsty in the night-time,\r\nbefore going to rest may drink two or three cyathi of wine through a\r\nsmall pipe. It is good also against a slow concoction to read aloud,\r\nthen to walk, afterwards to anoint or bathe, to drink always cold wine,\r\nand after meat to drink largely, but in the way I mentioned already by\r\na siphon: lastly, to conclude all the drinks with cold water. He, whose\r\nfood grows sour in his stomach, before he eats, should drink egelid\r\nwater, and vomit. But if the use of this should occasion a looseness,\r\nwhenever he is relieved of that complaint, he should by all means make\r\nuse of cold drinks.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. IX.\r\n\r\nDIRECTIONS FOR THOSE THAT ARE LIABLE TO PAINS OF THE NERVES.\r\n\r\n\r\nHe that is subject to pains in the nerves, as is common in the gout\r\nof the hands or feet, ought as much as possible to exercise the part\r\naffected, and expose it to labour and cold; unless the pain has\r\nbecome violent, in which case rest is best. Venery is always hurtful.\r\nConcoction is necessary, as well in this, as in all disorders of\r\nthe body: for crudity injures it more than any thing; and whenever\r\nthe body is out of order, the diseased part feels it most sensibly.\r\nAs concoction is an adversary to all diseases, so some again are\r\nrelieved by cold, and others by heat. Either of which every one ought\r\nto procure, according to the habit of his body. Cold is hurtful to an\r\nold or slender man, to a wound, to the præcordia, intestines, bladder,\r\nears, hips, shoulders, private parts, teeth, bones, nerves, womb, and\r\nbrain. It also renders the surface of the skin pale, dry, hard, and\r\nblack. From this proceed shudderings and tremours. But it is beneficial\r\nto young people, and all that are of a full habit. The mind also is\r\nmore brisk, and the concoction goes on better, when ’tis cold, if\r\ndue care is taken to guard against it. Cold water poured on, besides\r\nbeing useful to the head, does good to the stomach. It is likewise of\r\nservice to the joints, and pains, which are not attended with ulcers;\r\nalso to persons, that are too ruddy, if they be free from pain. Heat\r\nhelps whatever cold hurts; and those too that have blear eyes, if they\r\nhave neither pain nor an effusion of tears; also contracted nerves,\r\nand especially those ulcers which arise from cold. It causes a good\r\ncolour in the body, and promotes the excretion of urine. In too great\r\na degree, it enervates the body, softens the nerves, and relaxes\r\nthe stomach. But neither cold nor heat is by any means safe, coming\r\nsuddenly upon persons unaccustomed to it; for cold occasions pains\r\nin the sides, and other disorders, and cold water causes scrophulous\r\nswellings; heat hinders concoction, prevents sleep, wastes by sweat,\r\nand renders the body obnoxious to pestilential distempers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. X.\r\n\r\nDIRECTIONS IN A PESTILENCE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are some rules necessary to be observed in a pestilence by a\r\nman, who continues in good health, but cannot however be secure. At\r\nthat time it is proper to take journies and to sail. When that can’t\r\nbe done, to use gestation, gentle walking in the open air before the\r\nheat of the day, and unction with the same moderation; and as has been\r\ndirected above, to avoid fatigue, crudity, cold, heat, and venery, and\r\nconfine himself to a strict regimen. If he feel any heaviness hanging\r\nabout his body, then he is neither to rise in the morning, nor walk\r\nbarefooted at any time, much less after meat or the bath; nor to vomit\r\neither with an empty stomach, or after supper: neither should the belly\r\nbe purged; and if it grow loose of itself, it must be restrained.\r\nAbstinence should rather be observed, if the body is plethoric. Also it\r\nis proper to avoid the bath, sweating, sleeping in the middle of the\r\nday, especially after meat; which by the way, it is more convenient to\r\ntake once a day, and that sparingly, lest it should occasion crudity:\r\nevery other day to drink alternately water and wine. These rules being\r\ncarefully observed, as little alteration as possible should be made\r\nin the usual course of life. And as they are to be practised in every\r\npestilence, so principally in that, which is occasioned by southerly\r\nwinds. And the very same precautions are necessary for those that take\r\njournies, when they have set out from home in a sickly season of the\r\nyear, or have come into sickly countries. But if the nature of any\r\nengagements should prevent the observance of the other rules, yet it\r\nwill be necessary to live abstemiously; and thus to change from wine\r\nto water, and from that to wine again, in the manner that has been\r\nprescribed above.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA. CORNELIUS CELSUS\r\n\r\n        OF\r\n\r\n     MEDICINE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_BOOK II._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE.\r\n\r\n\r\nOf the approach of a disorder there are many signs. In the explication\r\nof which, I shall, without hesitation, make use of the authority of\r\nthe ancients, and more especially that of Hippocrates; as even the\r\nmore modern physicians, although they have made alterations in the\r\nmethod of curing, nevertheless confess, that he has delivered the best\r\nprognostics from these signs. But before I speak of those antecedents,\r\nwhich give cause to apprehend distempers ensuing; it seems not improper\r\nto explain, what seasons of the year, what kinds of weather, what times\r\nof life, what constitutions are most safe from, or most obnoxious to\r\ndangers, and what kinds of disorders are most to be feared in each of\r\nthese. Not but in any weather(1), men of all ages and all habits,\r\nfall into all kinds of distempers, and die of them too; but because\r\nsome events are more frequent than others. And therefore it is useful\r\nfor every person to know, against what, and when, he should be most\r\nupon his guard.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. I.\r\n\r\nOF THE DIFFERENT SEASONS, WEATHER, AGES, CONSTITUTIONS, AND THE\r\nDISEASES PECULIAR TO EACH.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe most healthful season then is the spring, next to that the winter,\r\nthe summer is more dangerous than either, the autumn by far the most\r\ndangerous of all. With regard to the weather, that is best, which is\r\nequal, whether it be cold or hot: that, which varies most, is the\r\nworst. For this reason it is, that the autumn destroys the greatest\r\nnumber. For generally in the middle of the day it is hot, the nights,\r\nmornings, and evenings too, are cold: thus the body relaxed by the\r\n_preceding_ summer, and by the frequent meridian heats _of autumn_,\r\nis exposed to sudden cold. But as this is most common in this season,\r\nso it is hurtful, whenever it happens. When the weather is equal,\r\nserene days are most healthful: rainy are better than those that are\r\nonly misty or cloudy: and in winter those days are best, that have no\r\nwind at all; in summer, that have the westerly breezes. If the winds\r\nblow from any of the other quarters, the northerly are more salutary\r\nthan the easterly or southerly. Nevertheless these sometimes differ\r\naccording to the situation of countries. For generally in every place a\r\nwind, that comes from the inland parts, is healthful; one from the sea\r\nis sickly. And not only health is more certain in a good temperature\r\nof the weather, but even the more malignant distempers, which happen\r\nto come on then, are more mild and sooner removed. That air is the\r\nworst for a sick person, which has occasioned his distemper; insomuch\r\nthat in such a case, a change for weather in it’s own nature worse is\r\nfavourable.\r\n\r\nThe middle age is safest, because it is neither endangered by the\r\nheat of youth, nor the coldness of old age. Old age is more liable to\r\nchronical diseases, and youth to acute ones. The body most promising\r\nfor health is the square, neither over slender, nor over fat. For a\r\ntall stature, as it is comely in youth, so it quickly wears out by age.\r\nA slender body is weak, a corpulent heavy.\r\n\r\nWhatever disorders arise from the motion of the humours, are generally\r\nto be most apprehended in the spring(2); so that, at this season,\r\nlippitudes, pimples, hæmorrhages, abscesses of the body, which the\r\nGreeks call apostemata[AF], atrabilis, which they name melancholia[AG],\r\nmadness, epilepsy, angina, gravedoes, and catarrhs, usually occur.\r\nAlso those distempers in the joints and nerves, which sometimes are\r\ntroublesome, and sometimes easy, at this time of the year are the\r\nmost apt both to begin and return. Neither is the summer altogether\r\nfree from most of the above-mentioned distempers; but adds moreover\r\nfevers, either ardent, or tertian, vomitings, purgings, ear-achs,\r\nulcers of the mouth, gangrenes, both in the other parts of the body,\r\nand chiefly in the private parts; and all these disorders that waste a\r\nman by sweat. There is hardly any of these, that is not found in the\r\nautumn; but there arise then, besides irregular fevers, pain of the\r\nspleen, dropsical disorders(3), consumption, which the Greeks call\r\nphthisis[AH]; difficulty of urine, which they term stranguria[AI];\r\nthe distemper of the smaller intestine which they name ileos[AJ],\r\nthere happens also what the Greeks call lienteria[AK]; pains of the\r\nhips, epileptic disorders. And the same season is mortal to those that\r\nare worn out with long diseases, and such, as have been oppressed by\r\nthe preceding summer; and it dispatches some by new distempers, and\r\ninvolves others in very tedious ones, especially quartan agues, which\r\nmay even continue through the winter. Nor is any season more liable to\r\nthe plague, of whatever kind it be, however various in its manner of\r\nhurting. The winter provokes pains of the head, the cough, and whatever\r\ndisorder is contracted in the fauces, sides, or bowels.\r\n\r\n  [AF] ἀποστήματα.\r\n\r\n  [AG] μελαγχολία.\r\n\r\n  [AH] φθίσις.\r\n\r\n  [AI] στραγγουρία.\r\n\r\n  [AJ] εἰλεος.\r\n\r\n  [AK] λειεντερία.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the varieties of weather, the north wind raises a\r\ncough, exasperates the fauces, binds the belly, suppresses urine,\r\nexcites shudderings, also pain of the side and breast; yet it braces a\r\nsound body(4), and renders it more mobile and brisk. The south wind\r\ncauses dulness of hearing, blunts the senses, raises a pain of the\r\nhead, opens the belly, and renders the whole body heavy, moist, and\r\nlanguid. The other winds, by how much they approach more nearly to\r\neither of these, produce effects the more similar to each of them. All\r\nheat inflames the liver and spleen, enervates the mind, and occasions\r\nfaintings, and hæmorrhages. Cold causes sometimes convulsions, and\r\nsometimes a tetanus, the Greek name for the first is spasmos[AL],\r\nand for the other tetanos[AM]: it produces blackness in ulcers, and\r\na shuddering in fevers. In dry weather we meet with acute fevers,\r\nlippitudes, dysenteries, stranguries, pains of the joints; in rainy,\r\ntedious fevers, diarrhœas, angina, gangrenes, epilepsies, palsy, which\r\nthe Greeks call paralysis[AN]. Nor is the present weather only to\r\nbe considered, but also what has been its course for some time. If\r\na dry winter has been attended with northerly winds, and the spring\r\nwith southerly, and rains, there most commonly ensue lippitudes,\r\ndysenteries, fevers, and these chiefly in more delicate bodies,\r\nparticularly women. But if southerly winds and rains have prevailed in\r\nthe winter, and the spring be cold and dry, then indeed pregnant women,\r\nwhose time is near, are in danger of a miscarriage; and those, that go\r\ntheir full time, bring forth weakly children, not likely to live. Other\r\npeople are attacked with dry lippitudes, and if they are old, with bad\r\ngravedoes and catarrhs. But if the southerly winds have continued from\r\nthe beginning of winter to the end of spring, people are very quickly\r\ntaken off by pleurisies, and fevers attended with a delirium, which is\r\ncalled phrenitis[AO]. But when the heat begins with the spring, and\r\ncontinues through the summer, profuse sweating in fevers necessarily\r\nfollows. But if a dry summer has been attended with northerly winds,\r\nand the autumn with rains, and southerly, all the following winter\r\nwe find coughs, catarrhs, hoarseness, and in some a consumption. But\r\nif the autumn too is equally dry, and the same northerly winds blow,\r\nall the more delicate bodies, amongst which I placed women, enjoy a\r\ngood state of health: and for the more robust, they may possibly be\r\nattacked with dry lippitudes, and fevers either acute, or tedious, and\r\natrabiliary disorders.\r\n\r\n  [AL] σπασμὸς.\r\n\r\n  [AM] τέτανος.\r\n\r\n  [AN] παράλυσις.\r\n\r\n  [AO] φρεν̃ιτιϛ.̃\r\n\r\nAs to the different ages, children, and those a little more advanced,\r\nhave their health best in the spring, and are most safe in the\r\nbeginning of summer; old men in the summer, and beginning of autumn;\r\nyoung and middle aged men in the winter. The winter is more hurtful\r\nto old men, and the summer to youths. For the peculiar weaknesses,\r\nthat appear at different times of life, first of all infants and young\r\nchildren will be troubled with spreading ulcers of the mouth, which\r\nthe Greeks call aphthæ[AP], vomitings, nightly watching, humour in\r\nthe ears, and inflammations about the navel. The peculiar complaints\r\nof such as are teething, are exulcerations in the gums, convulsions,\r\nslight fevers, purgings, and these are chiefly troublesome about the\r\ncutting of the canine teeth. Infants of the fullest habit, and whose\r\nbellies are very much bound, are most liable to these dangers. But when\r\nthey have grown up a little, there appear disorders of the glands,\r\nand different inclinations of the vertebræ, which compose the spine,\r\nscrophulous swellings, some painful kinds of warts, by the Greeks\r\ncalled acrochordones[AQ], and many other tubercles. In the beginning\r\nof puberty, many of the above-named, and long fevers, and hæmorrhages\r\nfrom the nose. And generally all children are most in danger first\r\nabout the fortieth day, then the seventh month, then the seventh year,\r\nafter these at the time of puberty. Moreover any distempers, which\r\ncommence in infancy, and are terminated neither by puberty, nor in men\r\nby their first commerce with women, nor in women by the appearance of\r\ntheir menses, commonly continue long: yet more frequently these puerile\r\ndisorders of long standing are removed by these means. Youth is most\r\nsubject to acute disorders, and epileptic, and to a consumption: and\r\nthey are commonly young men, who spit blood. After this age, come\r\non pleurisies and peripneumonies, lethargy, cholera, madness, and\r\ndischarges of blood from certain mouths, as it were, of the veins,\r\nby the Greeks called hæmorrhoides[AR]. In old age, difficulty of\r\nbreathing, and making urine, gravedo, pains of the joints and kidneys,\r\npalsies, bad habit of body, which the Greeks call cachexia[AS],\r\nnightly watchings, tedious disorders of the ears, of the eyes, and\r\nnose, and especially a loose belly, and its consequences a dysentery,\r\nor lientery, and other indispositions incident to that habit. Besides\r\nthese the slender are distressed with consumptions, purgings,\r\ncatarrhs, and pains of the bowels, and sides. The corpulent generally\r\nare oppressed with acute diseases, and difficulty of breathing, and\r\noften die suddenly, which seldom happens in a more slender body.\r\n\r\n  [AP] ἄφθαι.\r\n\r\n  [AQ] ἀκροχορδ́ονες.\r\n\r\n  [AR] αἱμοῤῥοίδες.\r\n\r\n  [AS] καχεξία.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. II.\r\n\r\nOF THE SIGNS OF AN APPROACHING ILLNESS.\r\n\r\n\r\nBefore an illness, as I mentioned above, there appear some signs of\r\nits approach. All of them have this in common, that the body alters\r\nfrom its ordinary state; and not only for the worse, but even for\r\nthe better. For this reason, if one has become more plump, and looks\r\nbetter, and of a more florid complexion than usual, he ought to hold\r\nthese advantages suspected. For because these things can neither\r\ncontinue at a stay, nor admit further improvement, they generally run\r\nbackward very fast, like some heavy body tumbling down. But it is a\r\nworse sign, when one is emaciated contrary to his natural habit, and\r\nhas lost his colour and comeliness: because bodies redundant can allow\r\nsomething to be carried off by a distemper; the deficient have not\r\nwherewithal to bear the force of the distemper itself. Besides there\r\nis cause to be presently alarmed, if the limbs are heavy; if frequent\r\nulcers break out; if the body has grown hotter than common; if sleep\r\nbe too heavy; if the dreams are tumultuous; if one awakes oftner than\r\nusual, and then falls asleep again; if the body of a person asleep\r\nsweats in some parts contrary to custom, especially if that be about\r\nthe breast, or neck, or legs, or knees, or hips; also if the mind is\r\nlanguid; if there is a reluctance to speaking and motion; if the body\r\nbe indisposed to action; if the præcordia are pained, or the whole\r\nbreast, or which happens in most people, the head; if the mouth is\r\nfilled with saliva; if the eyes feel pain in turning; if the temples\r\nbe strait bound(5): if the limbs have shudderings; if the breathing\r\nis difficult; if the arteries in the forehead are dilated and beat\r\nstrong; if there be frequent yawnings; if the knees feel tired, or\r\nthe whole body be afflicted with a lassitude. Several of these things\r\noften, some of them always, precede a fever. This, however, ought to\r\nbe first considered, whether any of these happen frequently to a person\r\nwithout any consequent uneasiness. For there are some peculiarities\r\nin the constitutions of particular persons, without the knowledge of\r\nwhich, it is not easy to prognosticate what is to happen. With reason\r\ntherefore a man is free from apprehensions about those things, which\r\nhe has often escaped without danger: he only is justly uneasy, to whom\r\nthese appearances are new, or who has never been secured from their bad\r\neffects without proper precautions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. III.\r\n\r\nGOOD SYMPTOMS IN SICK PEOPLE.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen any person is seized with a fever, it is certain he is not in\r\ndanger, if he lies either upon his right or left side, as may have\r\nbeen usual with him, with his legs a little drawn up, which by the\r\nway is commonly the lying posture of a person in health; if he turns\r\nhimself with ease; if he sleeps in the night-time, and keeps awake in\r\nthe day; if he breathes easily; if he does not struggle; if the skin\r\nabout the navel and pubes be full(6); if his præcordia be equally\r\nsoft on both sides, without any sense of pain; or although they are a\r\nlittle swelled, yet yield to the impression of the fingers, and are\r\nnot pained. This illness, though it will continue some time, yet will\r\nbe safe. The body also, which is every where soft, and in the same\r\ndegree of heat, and which sweats all over equally, and whose fever is\r\nremoved by that sweat, is in a fair way of doing well. When the body\r\nis recovering its health, sneezing also is amongst the good signs,\r\nand an appetite, either continued from the beginning, or even coming\r\nafter a nausea. Nor should that fever alarm, which terminates in one\r\nday; nor indeed that, which though it has prevailed for a longer time,\r\nyet has totally intermitted betwixt paroxysms, so as the body became\r\nfree from all complaint, which the Greeks call eilicrines[AT]. If any\r\nthing happens to be discharged by vomiting, it ought to be a mixture\r\nof bile and phlegm: and the sediment of the urine white, smooth,\r\nequal; so that, if there is any thing like small clouds swimming in\r\nit, that subsides to the bottom. And the stools in one, who is safe\r\nfrom danger, are soft, figured, and evacuated at nearly the same\r\nintervals, as was usual in health, and in quantity duly proportioned to\r\nthe nourishment, that is taken. A loose belly is worse: but even this\r\nshould not immediately be esteemed dangerous, if the discharge be of a\r\nharder consistence in the morning, or gradually turn less liquid, and\r\nthe excrements be reddish, and their offensive smell don’t exceed that\r\nof the like discharge of a healthy man. And there is nothing bad in\r\nvoiding some worms at the end of the distemper(7). If a flatulency\r\nhas occasioned a pain and swelling in the upper parts without an\r\ninflammation, a rumbling of the belly from thence to the lower parts\r\nis a good sign; and more so, if it has found an easy passage with the\r\nexcrements.\r\n\r\n  [AT] Εἱλικρινὲς, sincere, or unmixed; so that it is explained\r\n  naturally enough by our author _integrum_, _sound_, which I chuse to\r\n  render by _free from all complaint_, because we never apply the term\r\n  _sound_ to a body, that has any distemper hanging about it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. IV.\r\n\r\nBAD SYMPTOMS IN SICK PEOPLE.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the other hand there is hazard of a dangerous distemper, when\r\nthe patient lies supine, with his arms and legs extended: when he\r\ninclines to sit up during the greatest violence of an acute distemper,\r\nespecially in a peripneumony: when he is distressed with wakefulness\r\nin the night, even although he sleep in the day time. Now sleep, which\r\nhappens betwixt the fourth hour(8) and night, is worse than that,\r\nwhich is betwixt morning and the same hour. But it is worst of all,\r\nif he neither sleep in the night, nor the day time: for that cannot\r\nwell happen without a constant delirium. Neither is it a good sign\r\nto be oppressed with sleep beyond measure: and the worse, the nearer\r\nthe sleep comes to being continued day and night. It is also a sign\r\nof a dangerous distemper to breathe quickly, and with vehemence; for\r\nshudderings to have come on after the sixth day; to spit matter;\r\nto expectorate with difficulty; to have constant pain; to be much\r\ndistressed with the distemper; to toss the arms and legs about; to weep\r\ninvoluntarily; to have a glutinous humour sticking to the teeth; for\r\nthe skin about the navel and pubes to be emaciated; for the praecordia\r\nto be inflamed, painful, hard, swelled, tense: the case is worse, if\r\nthese appearances be more on the right side than on the left: but the\r\ndanger is still greatly increased, if at the same time the pulsation\r\nof the arteries there be violent. Again, it indicates a bad distemper\r\nto be too quickly emaciated; to have the head, feet, and hands cold,\r\nwith the belly and sides hot; or for the extremities to be cold during\r\nthe violence of an acute distemper; or to shudder after sweating; or\r\nafter vomiting to have the hiccough, or the eyes to be red; or after\r\nhaving an appetite for food, or at the end of long fevers, to loath\r\nit; to sweat much, and especially a cold sweat; or to have sweats not\r\nequally diffused over the whole body, and such as do not terminate\r\nthe fever. They are also bad fevers, which return every day at the\r\nsame time; or those, that always have paroxysms equally violent, and\r\nwhich do not remit every third day; or those, that continue so as to\r\nincrease in their paroxysms, and only remit in their intervals, but\r\nnever leave the body quite free from disorder. It is worst of all, if\r\nthe fever does not at all remit, but continues with equal violence.\r\nIt is dangerous too for a fever to come after a jaundice, especially\r\nif the praecordia have continued hard on the right side; or on the\r\nleft, if attended with pain there. Every acute fever ought to give us\r\nno small apprehensions: and always in such a fever, or after sleep,\r\nconvulsions are terrible. It is also a sign of a bad distemper to wake\r\nwith a fright, and likewise in the beginning of a fever for the mind to\r\nbe presently disordered, or any limb to become paralytic. In that case,\r\nthough the patient escape with life, yet for the most part that limb is\r\ndebilitated. A vomiting also of pure phlegm or bile is dangerous; and\r\nif it be green, or black, it is worse. Urine is bad, where the sediment\r\nis reddish or livid; and worse, in which there is a kind of small and\r\nwhite threads: and worst of all, that, which bears the resemblance of\r\nsmall clouds, composed as it were of particles of bran. Thin and white\r\nurine is bad, but especially in phrenitic patients. It is bad to have\r\nthe belly entirely bound. And a purging too in fevers is dangerous,\r\nwhere it will not allow a man to rest in his bed; especially if the\r\ndischarge be very liquid, or whitish, or pale, or frothy. Besides these\r\nit portends danger, if the excretion be small in quantity, glutinous,\r\nsmooth, white, and at the same time of a palish colour; or if it is\r\neither livid, or bilious, or bloody, or of a more offensive smell than\r\ncommon. An unmixed discharge also, which comes after long fevers, is\r\nbad.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. V.\r\n\r\nSIGNS OF LONG SICKNESS.\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter the foregoing symptoms have appeared, ’tis known, that a\r\ndistemper will become tedious: for it must necessarily be so, unless it\r\nbe mortal. And there is no other hope in violent diseases, than that\r\nthe patient may escape by eluding the first shock of the distemper,\r\nthat there may be room for the application of proper methods of cure.\r\nBut some signs appear in the beginning of a distemper, from which we\r\nmay gather, that although it does not prove mortal, yet it will last\r\nfor a considerable time. In fevers not violent, when a cold sweat comes\r\non only about the head or neck; or when the body sweats without the\r\nfever intermitting; or when the body is sometimes cold, and sometimes\r\nhot, and the colour changes; or when in fevers an abscess, which has\r\nbeen formed in some part, does not prove salutary; or when the patient,\r\nconsidering the time of his illness, is but little emaciated. Also, if\r\nthe urine at some times is thin and limpid, and at other times has some\r\nsediment; and if what subsides be smooth, and white, or red; or if it\r\nhave the appearance of motes; or if it send up air bubbles.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. VI.\r\n\r\nTHE SYMPTOMS OF DEATH.\r\n\r\n\r\nBut though in such circumstances there is reason to fear, yet there\r\nremains some hope. But we are sure a person is come to the last stage,\r\nwhen the nose is sharp, the temples shrivelled, the eyes hollow, the\r\nears cold, and languid, and slightly inverted at their extremities,\r\nthe skin about the forehead hard and tense, the colour either black\r\nor very pale; and much more so, if these things happen without any\r\npreceding wakefulness, or purging, or fasting: from which causes this\r\nappearance sometimes arises, but then it vanishes in one day. So that\r\nif it continues longer, it is a forerunner of death. And if it remains\r\nthe same for three days in a tedious distemper, death is very near:\r\nand more especially if besides the eyes can’t bear the light and shed\r\ntears; and the white part of them grows red; and their small vessels\r\nare pale; and humour floating in them at last sticks to the angles; and\r\none eye is less than the other; and they are either very much sunk,\r\nor much swelled; and when the eye-lids in sleep are not closed, but\r\nbetwixt them there appears some part of the white of the eye; provided\r\nit be not occasioned by a flux; when the eye-lids also are pale, and\r\nthe same paleness discolours the lips and nose; and also when the lips,\r\nand nose, and eyes, and eye-lids, and eye-brows, or some of these, are\r\ndistorted, and the patient from pure weakness loses his hearing, or\r\nsight.\r\n\r\nDeath is also to be expected, when the patient lies supine, and his\r\nknees are contracted; when he slides downward now and then towards\r\nhis feet; when he lays bare his arms and legs, and tosses them about\r\nirregularly, and there is no heat in them; when he gapes with his\r\nmouth; when he sleeps constantly; when being insensible, he grinds\r\nhis teeth, and had not that custom in health; when an ulcer, which\r\nbroke out either before, or in the time of his sickness, has grown\r\ndry, and turned either pale or livid, The following symptoms are\r\nalso deadly; pale-coloured nails, and fingers; a cold breath; or if\r\none in a fever, and acute disease, or madness, or peripneumony, or\r\npain of the head, gathers the wool off the cloaths with his hands, or\r\ndraws out and smooths their edges, or catches at any small prominences\r\nin an adjoining wall. Pains also, that have begun in the hips and\r\nlower parts, if they have been translated to the bowels, and suddenly\r\nceased, are sure prognostics of approaching death; and more so, if any\r\nof the other symptoms have also concurred. And it is impossible to\r\nsave that person, who labouring under a fever without any tumour, is\r\nsuddenly, _as it were_, strangled, or cannot swallow his spittle; or\r\none, whose neck, while the fever and habit of body remain the same,\r\nis turned aside, so that it is equally impossible for him to swallow\r\nany thing; or him, who at the same time has a continued fever, and\r\nextreme weakness of body; or when, without an abatement of the fever,\r\nthe external surface of his body is cold, and the internal parts so\r\nhot as to produce thirst; or one, who, the fever continuing as in the\r\nformer case, is distressed at once with a delirium and difficulty of\r\nbreathing; or one, who, after drinking hellebore, has been seized with\r\nconvulsions; or one, that has lost his speech after being intoxicated\r\nwith liquor, for he is commonly carried off by convulsions, unless\r\neither a fever has supervened, or he has begun to speak at the time,\r\nwhen the effects of the liquor shall be over. A pregnant woman is also\r\neasily destroyed by an acute distemper. And likewise any person, whose\r\ndisorder is increased by sleep; and one, who in the beginning of a\r\nrecent disorder, vomits, or voids by stool, atrabilis; and the event is\r\nthe same, where this has been discharged in either of these ways, when\r\nthe body has been already extenuated, and wasted by a long illness. A\r\nbilious spitting, and purulent, whether they come up separately, or\r\nmixed, shew that there is danger of death. And if this appearance has\r\ncommenced about the seventh day of a disease, the consequence is, that\r\nthe patient will die about the fourteenth, unless some other symptoms\r\nmore benign, or malignant, come on: and these after symptoms, the more\r\ngentle or violent they are, signify that death will happen so much the\r\nlater, or sooner. A cold sweat likewise in an acute fever is mortal;\r\nand in every disease, a vomiting variegated with different colours;\r\nand especially if it be fetid. And it is also extremely bad to vomit\r\nblood in a fever. The urine is commonly of a bright yellow colour and\r\nthin in great crudity; and often before it has time to concoct, kills\r\nthe patient. Upon this account, if it continue so for any time, it\r\nprognosticates danger of death. But the worst of all and most deadly\r\nis the black, thick, and fetid. And such as this is the worst in men\r\nand women; but in children that, which is thin and watery. A variegated\r\ndischarge also by the belly is very bad; and such as contains\r\nstrigments(9), blood, bile, and something green, and these either at\r\ndifferent times, or all together in a kind of mixture, but so as each\r\nof them appear distinctly. Yet ’tis possible for one to endure this\r\nsomewhat longer. But a speedy death is denoted, when the discharge is\r\nliquid, and withal either black, or pale, or fat; especially if besides\r\nit have an intolerable stench.\r\n\r\nI am sensible I may be asked, how it happens, if the signs of future\r\ndeath are infallible, that some, who are entirely given over by\r\nphysicians, should recover, and that some are reported to have come\r\nto life again, even when they were carried out to be buried? Nay, the\r\njustly famed Democritus maintained, that even the marks that life was\r\ngone, which physicians had trusted, were not certain: so far was he\r\nfrom allowing, that there could be any certain prognostics of death.\r\nIn answer to which I shall not insist, that some marks, which bear\r\na great resemblance to each other, often deceive not the able, but\r\nthe unskilful physicians, (which Asclepiades knowing, when he met a\r\nfuneral, cried out, that the person, whom they were about to bury, was\r\nalive) and that the art is not to be charged with the faults of any of\r\nits professors. But I will answer with more moderation; that medicine\r\nis a conjectural art, and that the nature of conjecture is such, that\r\nalthough it answers for the most part, yet sometimes it fails. And\r\nif a _prognostic_ may deceive a person, perhaps in one of a thousand\r\ninstances, it must not therefore be denied credit, since it answers\r\nin innumerable others. And this I say not only with regard to the\r\nmortal, but also to the salutary _symptoms_. For hope too is sometimes\r\ndisappointed, and one dies, whom at first the physician thought in\r\nno danger. And those things, which have been contrived for curing,\r\nsometimes occasion a change for the worse. Nor is it possible for human\r\nweakness to avoid this, in so great a variety of constitutions. But\r\nmedicine however deserves credit, which most frequently, and in the\r\ngreatest number of sick people by far, is of service. Nevertheless we\r\nought not to be ignorant, that the prognostics both of recovery and\r\ndeath are more fallacious in acute distempers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. VII.\r\n\r\nOF THE SIGNS IN PARTICULAR DISEASES.\r\n\r\n\r\nHaving then mentioned those signs, which belong to diseases in general,\r\nI shall now proceed to point out those marks, which may attend the\r\nparticular kinds of them. Now there are some of these, which happen\r\nbefore, and others in the time of fevers, which discover either the\r\nstate of the internal parts, or what is likely to follow. Before\r\nfevers, if the head be heavy, or there be a dimness in the eyes after\r\nsleep, or there be frequent sneezings, some disorder from phlegm about\r\nthe head may be feared. If a person abound with blood, or be very hot,\r\nthe consequence is, that there may be an hæmorrhage from some part.\r\nIf any person is emaciated without an evident cause, he is in danger\r\nof falling into a bad habit of body. If the præcordia are pained, or\r\nthere is a troublesome flatulency, or if the urine is discharged the\r\nwhole day unconcocted, ’tis plain there is a crudity. Such as have a\r\nbad colour for a long time without a jaundice, are either distressed\r\nwith pains of the head, or labour under a malacia. Those, whose faces\r\nlong continue pale and swelled, have disorders either of the head,\r\nor bowels, or belly. If a boy in a continued fever has no passage in\r\nhis belly, and his colour is changed and he is deprived of sleep, and\r\nis constantly bemoaning, himself, convulsions are to be apprehended.\r\nA frequent catarrh in a slender body and tall, gives ground to fear\r\na consumption. When for several days there is no stool, it portends\r\neither a sudden purging, or a slight fever. When the feet swell,\r\nand there is a long continued purging, or pain in the bottom of the\r\nbelly and hips, a dropsical disorder is impending: but this kind of\r\ndistemper commonly arises from the ilia. Those also are exposed to\r\nthe same danger, whose belly, discharges nothing, when they have a\r\nstimulus, unless with difficulty, and the excrements hard. When there\r\nis a swelling in the feet, and when the like tumour, sometimes in the\r\nright, sometimes in the left side of the belly alternately rises and\r\nfalls, that disorder seems to arise from the liver. It is a mark of the\r\nsame distemper, when the intestines about the navel are pained, which\r\nthe Greeks call strophos[AU], and pains of the hip continue without\r\nbeing relieved either by time or remedies. If a pain of the joints,\r\nfor instance in the feet or hands, or in any other part, be attended\r\nwith a contraction of the nerves there; or if any limb fatigued by\r\nslight exercise, is equally distressed by heat and cold, we may expect\r\nthe gout either in the feet or hands, or that there will be a disease\r\nin that joint, where the pain is felt. Such as have had hæmorrhages\r\nfrom the nose, while they were children, which afterwards ceased, must\r\neither be afflicted with pains of the head, or have some troublesome\r\nexulcerations in their joints, or fall into some languishing distemper.\r\nWomen, whose menses are suppressed, will be subject to excruciating\r\npains of the head, or a disorder in some other part. And those are\r\nliable to the same dangers, who have complaints in their joints,\r\nsuch as pains and swellings coming and going, without the gout, and\r\nsuch-like distempers. Particularly if their temples are often pained,\r\nand their body sweats in the night-time, and their forehead itches,\r\nthere is fear of a lippitude. If a woman after delivery has violent\r\npains, with no other bad symptoms, about the twentieth day there will\r\neither be an eruption of blood from the nose, or some abscess in the\r\nlower parts. And _in general_ in any person, a violent pain about the\r\ntemples and forehead, will be removed in one of these two ways: more\r\nprobably by an hæmorrhage, if the person be young; if somewhat more\r\nadvanced, by a suppuration. A fever, which goes off suddenly without\r\nany apparent reason, without good signs, commonly returns. A person,\r\nwhose fauces are filled with blood, both in the day-time, and in the\r\nnight, will be found to have an ulcer there, if neither pains of the\r\nhead, nor of the præcordia, nor a cough, nor vomiting, nor slight\r\nfever have preceded. If a woman is attacked with a slight fever from a\r\ndisorder in the groin, and the cause does not appear, there is an ulcer\r\nin the womb. Thick urine, in which there is a white sediment, implies\r\nthat there is a pain about the joints, or the bowels, and fear of some\r\nimpending distemper. When it is green, it shows, that the bowels will\r\nbe pained, or that there will be a swelling attended with some danger;\r\nor at least, that the body is not sound. But if there is blood or\r\npus in the urine, either the bladder or kidneys are ulcerated. If it\r\nbe thick, and contain in it some small caruncles, or something like\r\nhairs; or if it be frothy, or fetid; or sometimes bring off something\r\nlike sand, and sometimes like blood; and the hips be pained, and those\r\nparts, which lie between them, and above the pubes; and besides these\r\nif there be frequent eructations, sometimes a bilious vomiting, and the\r\nextremities be cold, and there is a frequent inclination to make water,\r\nbut great difficulty in it, and what comes away be limpid, or reddish,\r\nor pale, and gives some small relief, and the belly be discharged with\r\nmuch wind; in such circumstances the distemper lies in the kidneys.\r\nBut if the urine drops away slowly, or if blood is discharged with it,\r\nand in that some bloody concretions, and it is made with difficulty,\r\nand the internal parts about the pubes are pained, the fault is in the\r\nbladder. Those, that have calculous concretions, are known by these\r\nsymptoms. The urine is made with difficulty, and comes away slowly, and\r\nby drops, and sometimes involuntarily, is sandy; sometimes blood, or\r\nbloody concretions, or something purulent is discharged with it. Some\r\nmake it more readily standing upright, others lying upon their back:\r\nespecially those, that have large stones; some even in an inclined\r\nposture, and these by drawing out the penis, alleviate their pain.\r\nThere is also a sensation of weight in that part, which is increased\r\nby running, and every kind of motion. Some also in the paroxysm of\r\nthe pain, cross their feet over one another, often changing them. But\r\nwomen are often obliged to rub the external orifice of their pudenda\r\nwith their hands: sometimes applying their finger to that part, when\r\nit presses upon the neck of the bladder, they feel the stone. But\r\nwhere any expectorate frothy blood, their disorder is in the lungs. A\r\npregnant woman, whose belly is very loose, may possibly miscarry. If\r\nthe milk flows from her breast, the fœtus is weak. Hard breasts shew\r\nthe child to be sound. A frequent hiccough, and of longer continuance\r\nthan ordinary, is a sign of an inflammation of the liver. If tumours\r\nupon ulcers have suddenly disappeared, and this has happened in the\r\nback, we may be apprehensive either of convulsions, or a tetanus: but\r\nif in the fore part of the body, either a pleurisy or madness is to\r\nbe expected. Sometimes also a purging, which is the safest of them\r\nall, follows such an accident. If the hæmorrhoidal veins, in one used\r\nto a discharge of blood from them, suddenly stop, either a dropsical\r\ndisorder or a consumption ensues. A consumption also comes on, if\r\nsuppurated matter derived from a pleurisy cannot be carried off within\r\nforty days. But where there is a long continued grief attended with\r\nlong fear and watching, the atrabiliary distemper is the consequence.\r\nThose, who have frequent hæmorrhages from the nose, labour under a\r\nswelling of the spleen, or pains of the head: and they commonly see\r\nimaginary objects floating before their eyes. But those, whose spleens\r\nare large, have their gums diseased and a stinking mouth, or an\r\nhæmorrhage in some part. If none of these happen, bad ulcers will be\r\nformed in their legs, and black cicatrices from them. Where there is\r\na cause of pain and no sense of it, the mind is disordered. If blood\r\nhas been collected in the abdomen, it is there converted into pus. If\r\na pain removes from the hips and the lower parts into the breast, and\r\nno bad symptom has supervened, there is danger of a suppuration in\r\nthat place. Those, that without a fever have a pain, or itching, with\r\nredness and heat, in any part, will have a suppuration there. Limpid\r\nurine also in a valetudinary person portends some suppuration about the\r\nears.\r\n\r\n  [AU] στρόφος.\r\n\r\nNow as these appearances, even without a fever, contain indications of\r\nwhat is latent or future, they are much more certain when accompanied\r\nwith a fever; and then symptoms of other disorders also shew\r\nthemselves. Wherefore when a person speaks more quickly than he used\r\nto do in health, and of a sudden talks much, and that with greater\r\nconfidence than ordinary; or when one breathes slow, and with great\r\nforce, and the pulse beats high, with hard and swelled præcordia,\r\nthen there is a fear of approaching madness. Frequent motion of the\r\neyes also, and a darkness arising before them, together with head-ach;\r\nor loss of sleep without any pain, and a continual watching day and\r\nnight; or lying upon the belly contrary to custom, if that is not\r\noccasioned by a pain of the belly itself; also an unusual grinding\r\nof the teeth, while the body continues strong, are signs of madness.\r\nIf an abscess has been formed, and subsides before a discharge by\r\nspitting comes on, the usual fever still continuing, there will be\r\ndanger first of madness, and then of death. An acute pain also of the\r\near, with a continued and strong fever, often disorders the mind: and\r\nof this malady younger people sometimes die in seven days; those that\r\nare older hold out something longer: because their fevers are not\r\nequally violent, nor their distraction so great; so that they last\r\ntill the distemper is resolved into pus. A suffusion of blood in the\r\nbreasts of a woman betokens approaching madness. Those, that have long\r\nfevers, will either have an abscess formed somewhere, or pains of the\r\njoints. Those, whose breath is greatly straitened in passing through\r\nthe fauces in fevers, will soon fall into convulsions. If an angina\r\nsuddenly disappears, the distemper is removing into the lungs; and that\r\nis often fatal before the seventh day: and if that does not happen, the\r\nconsequence is a suppuration in some part. Lastly, after long purgings\r\ncome dysenteries; after these a lientery; after violent catarrhs a\r\nconsumption; after pleurisies diseases of the lungs; after which\r\nmadness; after great heats of the body a tetanus or convulsion; after\r\na wound of the head a delirium; after great torment for want of sleep,\r\nconvulsions; when the blood vessels above ulcers are in strong motion,\r\nthere will be an hæmorrhage.\r\n\r\nA suppuration is produced many ways(10); for if fevers unattended\r\nwith pain continue long without any manifest cause, the disorder\r\nis transferred upon some particular part: but this happens only in\r\nyounger people; for in the elderly, a quartan ague is the common\r\nconsequence of such a disease. A suppuration also happens, if the\r\npræcordia being hard and pained have neither carried off the patient\r\nbefore the twentieth day, nor an hæmorrhage from the nose has ensued;\r\nand this holds chiefly in youths, especially if in the beginning of\r\nthe distemper they had dimness of the eyes, or pains of the head: but\r\nthen the abscess forms in the lower parts _of the body_. But if there\r\nbe a soft tumour in the præcordia, and it has not ceased within sixty\r\ndays, and the fever continues all that time, then the abscess forms\r\nin the superior parts: and if there is not a discharge of blood from\r\nthe nose(11) in the beginning, it breaks out about the ears. And as\r\nevery tumour of long standing generally tends to suppuration, so one,\r\nthat is seated in the præcordia is more likely to have that issue, than\r\none that is in the belly: and one, that is above the navel, than one,\r\nthat is below it. Also if there is a sense of lassitude in a fever, an\r\nabscess is formed either in the jaws, or the joints. Sometimes too the\r\nurine continues long and thin, and crude, and the other symptoms are\r\ngood: in this case for the most part an abscess is formed below the\r\ntransverse septum (which the Greeks call diaphragma). If a peripneumony\r\nis removed neither by expectoration, nor by cupping, nor bleeding, nor\r\na proper regimen, it sometimes gives rise to some vomicæ, either about\r\nthe twentieth day, or thirtieth, or fortieth, and even sometimes about\r\nthe sixtieth. Now we must date our reckoning from that day, in which\r\nthe person was first taken with the fever, or seized with a horror, or\r\nfelt a weight in the part. But these vomicæ are generated sometimes in\r\nthe lungs, sometimes about the ribs. Where the suppuration is seated,\r\nit raises a pain and inflammation, and there is a greater heat there:\r\nand if one has lain down upon the sound side, he imagines it loaded\r\nwith some weight. And every suppuration, that is not yet visible, may\r\nbe known by the following signs: the fever does not wholly intermit,\r\nbut is more mild in the day-time, and increases at night, there is\r\nplentiful sweating, an inclination to cough, and hardly any thing\r\nbrought up by it, the eyes are hollow, cheeks red, the veins under the\r\ntongue white, the nails of the hands crooked, the fingers, especially\r\ntheir extremities, hot; there are swellings in the feet, difficulty\r\nin breathing, loathing of food, pimples breaking out over the whole\r\nbody. But if the pain, cough, and difficulty of breathing have come on\r\nimmediately at the beginning, the vomica will break before, or about\r\nthe twentieth day. If these have begun later, they must of course\r\nincrease; but the less quickly they have appeared, the more slowly will\r\nthey be removed. It is common also in a severe distemper for the feet,\r\nhands, and nails to turn black: and if death has not followed, and the\r\nother parts of the body are restored, yet the feet fall off.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. VIII.\r\n\r\nWHAT SYMPTOMS ARE DANGEROUS, OR HOPEFUL IN PARTICULAR DISEASES.\r\n\r\n\r\nOur next business is to explain the particular marks in every kind\r\nof distemper, which either afford hope, or indicate danger. If the\r\nbladder be pained, and there be a discharge of purulent urine, and\r\nalso a smooth and white sediment in it, there is no danger. In a\r\nperipneumony, if the pain is mitigated by the spitting, although that\r\nbe purulent, yet if the patient breathes easily, expectorates freely,\r\nand is not much distressed with the distemper, he may possibly recover\r\nhis health. Nor need we immediately give way to fears, if the spittle\r\nis mixed with some reddish blood, provided that presently ceases.\r\nPleurisies, that suppurate, when the matter is carried off within\r\nforty days, are thereby terminated. If there is a vomica in the liver,\r\nand the matter discharged from it be unmixed and white, the patient\r\neasily recovers, for that disorder is seated in the membrane. Now these\r\nkinds of suppurated tumours are tolerable, which are directed towards\r\nthe external parts, and rise to a point. But of those, which point\r\ninward, the more mild are such, as while close, don’t affect the skin,\r\nand suffer it to remain without pain, and of the same colour with the\r\nother parts. Also pus from whatever part it is discharged, if it be\r\nsmooth, white, and uniform, is not at all dangerous; and if after the\r\nevacuation of it the fever has presently abated, and the nausea and\r\nthirst have ceased to be troublesome. If at any time also a suppuration\r\nfalls into the legs, and the patient’s discharge by spitting becomes\r\npurulent instead of reddish, the danger is less. But in a consumption,\r\nhe that is to recover, will have his spitting white, uniform, and of\r\nthe same colour, with out phlegm: and whatever falls down from the\r\nhead by the nostrils, should be of a like nature. ’Tis far best to be\r\naltogether free from a fever: next to this, that it be so gentle, as\r\nneither to prevent the taking of food, nor occasion a frequent thirst.\r\nIn this distemper that state of the belly is safe, in which every day\r\nconsistent excrements are evacuated, in quantity proportioned to the\r\nfood; and so is that body, which is least slender, and has the broadest\r\nand most hairy chest, and whose cartilage is small and fleshy. In a\r\nconsumption too, if a woman has had her menses suppressed, and while\r\nthe pain still remains about her breast, and shoulders, and the blood\r\nhas of a sudden made its way, the distemper is commonly mitigated:\r\nfor both the cough is lessened, and the thirst and febricula cease.\r\nBut in the same patients, if their menses do not return, for the most\r\npart the vomica breaks: and the more bloody the discharge from it is,\r\nso much the better. A dropsical disorder is the least to be feared,\r\nwhich has begun without any preceding distemper. Of the next favourable\r\nsort is that, which succeeds a long distemper, if at the same time the\r\nbowels be firm; if the breathing be easy; if there is no pain; if the\r\nbody is not hot; and is equally lean in its extremities; if the belly\r\nis soft; if there be no cough, no thirst; if the tongue even in sleep\r\ndoes grow dry; if there is an appetite for meat; if the belly yields\r\nto purging medicines; if spontaneously it discharges excrements soft\r\nand figured; if it grows less(12); if the urine is altered by the\r\nchange of wine, and by drinking certain medicinal potions; if the body\r\nis free from lassitude, and easily bears motion: for where one has all\r\nthese symptoms, he is altogether safe; where most of them appear, the\r\npatient is in a hopeful way. Diseases of the joints, as the gout in the\r\nfeet or hands, if they have attacked the patients young, and have not\r\nbrought on a callus, may be removed; and they are most of all allayed\r\nby a dysentery, and when by any means the belly becomes loose. Also\r\nan epilepsy, that begins before puberty, is easily removed; and where\r\na person sensibly feels the approaching fit first affecting some part\r\nof the body. It is best, that it begin at the hands or feet; next to\r\nthem, at the sides; but worst of all, when it begins at the head. And\r\nin these patients also, excretions by the belly are of the greatest\r\nservice. Now a purging is not in the least hurtful, which is without\r\na fever, if it quickly, ceases; if upon feeling the belly, there is no\r\nmotion perceived; if wind is discharged at the end of a stool. Nay even\r\na dysentery is not dangerous, if blood and strigments are discharged,\r\nprovided the patient is without a fever, and the other concomitants of\r\nthis distemper: insomuch, that a pregnant woman may not only be cured,\r\nbut her fœtus also preserved. And it is an advantage in this disorder,\r\nif the patient has come to some age. On the contrary, a lientery is\r\nmore easily cured in tender age: especially if the urine begins to\r\nbe excreted, and the body to be nourished with food. The same age is\r\nmost favourable in pains of the hip, and arms, and in every paralytic\r\ndisorder. Amongst these, the hip, if it be without numbness, if its\r\ncoldness be slight, although it be greatly pained, yet it is easily and\r\nquickly cured; and a paralytic limb, if it continue to be nourished,\r\nmay be recovered. A palsy of the mouth also is cured by a loose belly.\r\nAnd all purging does good to one labouring under a lippitude. Madness\r\nis removed by the appearance of a varicous swelling, or sudden eruption\r\nof blood from the hæmorrhoidal veins, or a dysentery. Pains of the\r\narms, which are propagated either to the shoulders, or hands, are\r\ncured by vomiting of atrabilis. And whatever pain moves downward, is\r\nmore easily cured. A hiccough is cured by sneezing. A vomiting stops\r\nlong purgings. A woman, that vomits blood, is relieved by the flux\r\nof her menses. She, whose menses are deficient, if there has been an\r\nhæmorrhage from the nose, is free from all danger. And one, that is\r\nhysteric(13) or has a difficult labour, is relieved by sneezing. To\r\none, that has a heat and tremour, a delirium is salutary. Dysenteries\r\nare of service to splenetic people. Lastly, a fever itself, which\r\nmay seem very wonderful, is often a remedy _for other distempers_.\r\nFor it both cures pains of the præcordia, that are not attended with\r\ninflammation, and relieves in a pain of the liver; and entirely removes\r\nconvulsions, and a tetanus, if it comes after them; and where the\r\ndistemper of the smaller intestine has been occasioned by a difficulty\r\nin making urine, if by the heat it promotes urine, it gives ease.\r\nPains of the head attended with dimness of the eyes and redness with\r\nan itching in the forehead, are removed by a discharge of blood,\r\neither spontaneous or procured. If pains of the head and forehead\r\narise from being exposed to the wind, or cold, or heat, they are cured\r\nby a gravedo, and sneezing. A sudden shuddering puts an end to an\r\nardent fever, which the Greeks call causodes[AV]. When in a fever,\r\nthere is a deafness, if blood is discharged from the nose, or the\r\nbelly turns loose, that disorder is entirely removed. Nothing is more\r\nprevalent against deafness, than bilious stools. Those, that have small\r\nabscesses, which the Greeks call phymata[AW], formed in the urethra,\r\nare cured, when pus is discharged from thence. Now as most of these\r\nfavourable turns happen of themselves, we may conclude, that nature has\r\nvery great power in these very helps, which are applied by art.\r\n\r\n  [AV] καυσώδης.\r\n\r\n  [AW] φύματα.\r\n\r\nOn the contrary, when there is a pain in the head in a continued\r\nfever, and it does not at all remit, it is a bad and mortal symptom:\r\nand boys from the seventh to the fourteenth year are most liable to\r\nthis danger. In a peripneumony, if the spitting did not come on in the\r\nbeginning, but after the seventh day, and has continued above other\r\nseven days, it is dangerous: and the more mixed and less distinct the\r\ncolours are, so much the worse. And yet nothing is worse, than for\r\nit to be excreted entirely homogeneous, whether it be reddish, or\r\nbloody, or white, or glutinous, or pale, or frothy: but the worst of\r\nall colours is black. A cough and catarrh are dangerous in the same\r\ndisease; also a sneezing, which in other cases is reckoned salutary;\r\nand there is the greatest danger of all, if these things have been\r\nfollowed by a sudden purging. Now generally the symptoms, which are\r\neither good or bad in peripneumonies, are so in pleurisies too. A\r\ndischarge of bloody pus from the liver is mortal. These are the worst\r\nkinds of suppurations, which tend inward, and discolour the external\r\nskin at the same time. Of that kind, that breaks outward(14), the\r\nworst are those, that are largest and flattest. But if the fever has\r\nnot gone off, when the vomica is broke, or the pus evacuated, or after\r\nits ceasing returns again; also if there be a thirst, or a nausea,\r\nor a loose belly, or livid and pale pus, if the patient expectorates\r\nnothing but frothy phlegm; then there is certain danger. And of these\r\nkinds of suppurations, which have been produced by diseases of the\r\nlungs, old men commonly die: but those; those that are younger, by\r\nthe other kinds. But in a consumption, a mixed and purulent spitting,\r\na continued fever, which also destroys the appetite, and torments with\r\nthirst, in a slender body are sure prognosticks of immediate danger. If\r\none has lasted under this distemper even for a considerable time, when\r\nthe hairs first fall off, when the urine has something floating upon\r\nit like cobwebs, and the spittle has a fetid smell, and particularly\r\nwhen after these a purging has appeared, he will die soon: and more\r\nespecially if it be autumn: in which season commonly those, that have\r\ngot over the other part of the year, come to the close of their life.\r\nIt is also mortal in this distemper to have expectorated pus, and\r\nafterwards for that to have entirely disappeared. It is likewise common\r\nfor this disease in young people to arise from a vomica or fistula;\r\nand they do not readily recover, unless many salutary symptoms have\r\nensued. With regard to others, virgins are the hardest to cure, or\r\nthose women, that fall into a consumption from a suppression of the\r\nmenses. A healthy person who has been taken with a sudden pain of his\r\nhead, and then fallen into a deep sleep, so as to snore, and does not\r\nawake, will die before seven days are expired: and more especially\r\nif, when a looseness has not preceded, his eyelids are not closed\r\nin sleep, but the white of his eyes appears. Death however is not\r\nthe certain consequence, if a fever comes on, which may remove the\r\ndistemper. A dropsical disorder occasioned by an acute distemper, is\r\nseldom cured: especially if followed by the opposite symptoms to those\r\nabove-mentioned. A cough likewise is equally destructive of hope in\r\nthis distemper: also an hæmorrhage either upward or downward, and a\r\ncollection of water in the middle of the body(15). Some people too in\r\nthis disease have swellings, which afterwards subside, and then appear\r\nagain. Such indeed are more safe than those mentioned before, if they\r\ntake the proper care: but they commonly perish from a persuasion of\r\ntheir being well. Some people with good reason will wonder, how any\r\nthing can at once both be hurtful to our bodies, and in part conduce\r\nto their preservation. For whether a dropsy has filled one with water,\r\nor a great quantity of pus has been collected in a large abscess, for\r\nthe whole to be discharged at once is equally mortal, as for a sound\r\nperson to lose all his blood by a wound. If the joints of any person\r\nare pained, so that some tubercles from a callus grow upon them, they\r\nare never cured: and the disorders of those parts, which have either\r\nbegun in old age, or have continued from youth to that time of life,\r\nthough they may be sometimes mitigated, yet are never entirely removed.\r\nAn epilepsy also, that begins after the twenty-fifth year, is difficult\r\nto cure: and much more so that, which has begun after the fortieth; so\r\nthat, although there may be some hope from nature, scarce any thing\r\nis to be expected from medicine at that age. In the same disease if\r\nthe whole body is affected at once, and the patient is not sensible of\r\nthe fit beginning in any part, but falls down suddenly, whatever his\r\nage be, he rarely gets free of the distemper: but if his intellects\r\nbe injured, or a palsy has come on, there is no room for medicine.\r\nIn purgings too, if attended with a fever; if with an inflammation\r\nof the liver, or præcordia, or belly; if with an intolerable thirst;\r\nif the disease has continued long; if the discharge of the belly is\r\nvariegated; if it is expelled with pain, there is danger even of\r\ndeath: and more especially if with these _symptoms_ a dysentery has\r\ngrown inveterate. And this distemper sweeps off children chiefly to\r\ntheir tenth year: at other times of life, it is more easily endured.\r\nA pregnant woman also may be carried off by such a case: and although\r\nshe herself recovers, yet she loses her child. Moreover a dysentery\r\noccasioned by atrabilis is mortal: or a sudden and black discharge from\r\nthe belly, when the body is already wasted by that distemper. But a\r\nlientery is more dangerous, if the purging be frequent; if the belly is\r\ndischarged at all hours, both with a rumbling, and without it; if it\r\ncontinues with equal violence both night and day; if what is excreted,\r\nis either crude, or black, and besides smooth and fetid; if thirst is\r\ntroublesome; if urine is not made after drinking (the cause of which\r\nis, that all the liquor at that time descends, not into the bladder,\r\nbut into the intestines) if the mouth is ulcerated; if the face is red,\r\nand marked with certain spots of all colours; if the belly is puffed\r\nup as it were by fermentation(16), fat and full of wrinkles; and if\r\nthere is no appetite for food. And as in these circumstances death is\r\nthe plain consequence; it is much more evidently so, if the disease\r\nis already of long standing; especially if withal the patient be old.\r\nIn the distemper of the smaller intestine, a vomiting, hiccough,\r\nconvulsion, and delirium, are bad symptoms. In the jaundice it is the\r\nmost pernicious symptom for the liver to be indurated. Those, that have\r\ndisorders in the spleen, if they be seized with a dysentery, which\r\nafterwards turns to a dropsy or a lientery, it is scarce in the power\r\nof medicine to save. The distemper of the smaller intestine arising\r\nfrom a difficulty of urine, unless it be removed by a fever, kills\r\nwithin seven days. If a woman after delivery is seized with a fever,\r\nand violent and constant pains of the head, she is in danger of dying.\r\nIf there is a pain and inflammation in those parts, which contain the\r\nbowels, it is a bad sign to fetch the breath often. If a pain of the\r\nhead continues long without a perceptible cause, and removes into the\r\nneck and shoulders, and again returns into the head; or comes from the\r\nhead to the neck and shoulders, it is dangerous: unless it produce\r\nsome vomica, so that the pus may be expectorated; or unless there is\r\nan hæmorrhage from some part; or scurf break out plentifully in the\r\nhead, or pustules over the whole body. It is an equally formidable\r\ndistemper when a numbness and itching wander about; sometimes over the\r\nwhole head, sometimes in a part of it; or when there is something like\r\na sensation of cold in the part, and these reach even to the end of\r\nthe tongue. And though in these cases abscesses are beneficial, yet\r\nthere is less hope of a recovery by their means, as they are seldom\r\nformed after such disorders begin. In pains of the hip, if there is\r\na great numbness, and the leg and hip are cold, and the belly has no\r\npassage, but when assisted, and the excrements are slimy, and the age\r\nof the person exceed forty, the distemper will be very tedious, and at\r\nleast of a year’s continuance; neither will it be possible to remove\r\nit, unless it be either in the spring or autumn. At the same time of\r\nlife, the cure is equally difficult, when a pain of the arms removes\r\ninto the hands, or reaches to the shoulders, and produces a torpor and\r\npain, and is not relieved by a bilious vomiting. A paralytic limb in\r\nany part of the body, if it has no motion, and pines away, will not\r\nrecover its former state; and the more inveterate the distemper, and\r\nthe more advanced in years the patient is, so much the less probable\r\nis the cure. And in every paralytic disorder, the winter and autumn are\r\nimproper seasons for medicine: some benefit may possibly be hoped for\r\nin the spring and summer. And this distemper, when moderate, is cured\r\nwith difficulty; when violent, it cannot be cured at all. Every pain\r\nalso, which moves upward, yields less to medicine. If the breasts of a\r\npregnant woman have shrunk suddenly, there is danger of a miscarriage.\r\nIn a woman that has milk, and has neither had a child, nor is pregnant,\r\nthe menses are suppressed. A quartan ague in the summer is short, but\r\nin the autumn commonly long; especially that, which has come on, when\r\nthe winter was approaching. If there has been an hæmorrhage followed\r\nwith madness and convulsions, there is danger of death. Also if a\r\nconvulsion has seized a person purged by medicines and still empty;\r\nor if the extremities are cold in the time of great pain. Nor does\r\na person return to life, who has been hanged, and taken down with a\r\nfrothing mouth. A black and sudden discharge of the belly, like black\r\nblood, whether it be attended with a fever or not, is pernicious.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. IX.\r\n\r\nOF THE CURE OF DISEASES.\r\n\r\n\r\nHaving considered those signs, which may give us hope or fear, we\r\nmust proceed to the methods of curing diseases. Now these are divided\r\ninto the general and particular: the general, which relieve several\r\ndistempers, the particular, which are confined to single disorders. I\r\nshall first treat of the general. But there are some of those, that not\r\nonly support the sick, but conduce to the preservation of the healthy,\r\nothers are made use of in sickness only.\r\n\r\nNow every thing that assists the body, either evacuates somewhat, or\r\nadds, or draws, or restrains, or cools, or heats, and at the same time\r\neither hardens, or mollifies. Some things also are useful not in one\r\nway only, but even in two, that are not contrary to each other. An\r\nevacuation is made by bleeding, cupping, purging, vomiting, friction,\r\ngestation, and all exercise of the body, abstinence and sweat. Of these\r\nI shall now treat.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. X.\r\n\r\nOF BLEEDING.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo let blood by the incision of a vein is not new: but to practise\r\nthis in almost every distemper is new. Again, to bleed younger people,\r\nand women, that are not pregnant, is of ancient use. But to attempt\r\nthe same in children and old people, and in pregnant women, is not\r\nan old practice. For indeed the ancients judged, that the first and\r\nlast stages of life were not able to bear this kind of remedy; and\r\nthey were persuaded, that a pregnant woman, who had been thus treated,\r\nwould miscarry. But afterwards experience proved, that none of these\r\nrules were universal, and that some other circumstances were rather\r\nto be regarded, by which the intention of the physician was to be\r\ndirected. For the material point is not, what the age may be, or what\r\nis contained within the body, but what degree of strength there is.\r\nUpon this account if a young man is valetudinary, or a woman not with\r\nchild be weak, bleeding is bad: for the remaining strength, is by this\r\nevacuation destroyed. Whereas to a stout boy, and a robust old man,\r\nand a strong pregnant woman, it may be used with safety. ’Tis true an\r\nunskilful physician may be greatly deceived in such patients: because\r\nthere is commonly less strength at these times of life. And a pregnant\r\nwoman stands in need of strength after her cure, to support not only\r\nherself, but her fœtus also. But whatever requires either attention\r\nof mind, or prudence, is not to be immediately rejected: since the\r\nexcellency of the art here consists, not in numbering the years, nor\r\nin regarding conception alone, but in considering the strength, and\r\ncollecting from thence, whether there will be left sufficient to\r\nsupport either a boy, or an old man, or two bodies at once in one\r\nwoman. There is a difference also between bodies strong, and corpulent:\r\nand those, that are slender, and infirm. In the slender, blood more\r\nabounds, but in those of a fuller habit, flesh. Wherefore the first\r\nbear this evacuation more easily: and he, that is over fat, is soonest\r\ndistressed by it. For this reason the strength of the body is to be\r\nestimated rather by the state of the vessels, than from its appearance.\r\n\r\nNor are these the only particulars to be considered, but also what kind\r\nof distemper it is: whether a redundancy, or deficiency of matter has\r\nbeen hurtful; whether the body be corrupted or sound. For if there be\r\na deficiency, or the humours be sound, this method is prejudicial. But\r\nif either the quantity of matter is hurtful, or it is corrupted, no\r\nother remedy is more successful; for this reason a violent fever, when\r\nthe skin is red, and the veins are full and turgid, requires bleeding:\r\nlikewise diseases of the bowels, and palsies, and the tetanus, and\r\nconvulsions; in fine, whatever strangulates the fauces, so as to cause\r\na difficulty in breathing; whatever suddenly stops the speech; any\r\npain, that is intolerable; and any internal rupture, or bruise, from\r\nwhatever cause; also a bad habit of body; and all acute distempers;\r\nprovided, as I observed above, they hurt not by weakness, but by\r\nredundancy.\r\n\r\nBut it may possibly happen, that a distemper may indeed require this\r\nmethod, and at the same time the body may seem hardly able to bear it:\r\nbut yet if there appears no other remedy, and the patient must perish,\r\nunless he shall be relieved even by a rash attempt; in this case, it\r\nis the part of a good physician to shew, that there is no hope without\r\nbleeding; and to confess what bad consequences may be apprehended even\r\nfrom that remedy; and after that, to bleed if desired. It is by no\r\nmeans proper to hesitate about it in such a situation as this: for it\r\nis better to try a doubtful remedy, than none at all. And this ought\r\nespecially to be practised, when there is a palsy; when one has lost\r\nhis speech suddenly; when an angina suffocates; when the preceding\r\nparoxysm of a fever has almost killed a person, and another equally\r\nsevere is likely to follow, and the strength of the patient seems\r\nunable to bear it.\r\n\r\nThough bleeding ought not to be performed in a state of crudity, yet\r\neven that does not hold always. For the circumstances will not at all\r\ntimes wait for concoction. So that if any person has fallen front\r\na height, or has received a contusion, or vomits blood from some\r\nsudden accident, although he has taken food a little before, yet that\r\nevacuation is proper, lest if the matter settle, it distress the body.\r\nThe same rule will hold in other sudden cases too, where there is a\r\ndanger of suffocation. But if the nature of the distemper will allow a\r\ndelay, it must not be done, till all remaining suspicion of crudity is\r\nremoved. Upon this account, the second or third day of an illness seems\r\nmost proper for this operation. But as sometimes it is necessary to\r\nbleed even on the first day, so it is never good after the fourth, when\r\nby time alone, the matter is either dissipated, or has corrupted the\r\nbody; so that the evacuation may weaken, but cannot make it sound. But\r\nwhen a vehement fever prevails, to bleed in the time of its violence is\r\nkilling the patient. Therefore an intermission(17) is to be awaited\r\nfor: if it does not intermit, when it has ceased to increase: if there\r\nbe no hopes even of a remission, in that case the only opportunity\r\noffered, though less favourable, is not to be neglected.\r\n\r\nFurther this remedy, where it is necessary, generally were best to be\r\ndivided into two days; for it is better at the first to lighten the\r\npatient, and after that to cleanse him thoroughly, than to run any risk\r\nof his life by dissipating all his strength at once. And if this method\r\nbe found to answer in the cure of a dropsy, how much more must it of\r\nnecessity answer with regard to the blood?\r\n\r\nIf the disorder be in the whole body, the evacuation ought to be made\r\nfrom the arm: if in any particular place, from the part affected, or\r\nat least as near to it as may be; because it cannot be performed every\r\nwhere, but only in the temples, and in the arms, and near the ancles. I\r\nam not ignorant, that it is the opinion of some, that blood should be\r\nlet at the greatest distance from the part where it does harm; for that\r\nthus the course of the matter is diverted; but in the other way it is\r\ndrawn into that very place, which is distressed. But this is altogether\r\nfalse. For it first empties the part nearest: and the blood flows from\r\nthe more remote, as long as the evacuation is continued: when this is\r\nstopt, because there is no more attraction, it then ceases to come.\r\nYet experience itself seems to have shewn, that in a fracture of the\r\nskull blood is to be let rather from the arm: and if the disorder is\r\nin one arm, it must be performed in the other: I suppose for this\r\nreason, because if any miscarriage should happen, those parts, which\r\nare already hurt(18), are more exposed to injuries. Sometimes also an\r\nhæmorrhage breaking out in one part, is stopt by bleeding in another.\r\nFor it ceases to flow, where we would not have it, when we apply what\r\nwill stop its course there, and open another passage for it.\r\n\r\nAltho’ bleeding is very easy to one, who has experience; yet it is very\r\ndifficult to one, that is ignorant. For the vein lies close to the\r\narteries; and to these the nerves. So that if the lancet has touched a\r\nnerve, a convulsion will follow, which destroys a man miserably. And\r\nthen a wounded artery neither unites again, nor heals; and sometimes it\r\noccasions a violent hæmorrhage. If also the vein itself happens to be\r\ncut quite through, the two ends are compressed, and discharge no blood.\r\nAgain, if the lancet is entered with fear, it lacerates the surface\r\nof the skin, and does not open the vein. Sometimes too the vein lies\r\nconcealed, and is not easily found. Thus many circumstances make that\r\ndifficult to an ignorant person, which is very easy to the skilful.\r\n\r\nThe vein is to be cut at the middle. And when the blood flows from it,\r\nits colour and consistence ought to be observed. For if it be thick\r\nand black, it is bad; and therefore the discharge is useful: if red\r\nand pellucid, it is sound; and that evacuation is so far from being\r\nbeneficial, that it may even hurt, and is immediately to be stopt. But\r\nsuch an accident cannot happen to the physician, who knows in what case\r\nbleeding is to be used. It more commonly happens, that it flows on\r\nthe first day equally black thro’ the operation. And altho’ it be so,\r\nyet if the discharge is sufficient, it must be stopt: and an end must\r\nalways be put to it, before the person faints.\r\n\r\nThen the arm is to be bound up, putting upon it a penecillum(19)\r\ndipt in cold water, and squeezed; and on the following day, the vein\r\nmust be rubbed with the middle finger, that its recent union may be\r\nresolved, and it may again discharge blood. Whether it happens on the\r\nfirst or second day, that the blood, which at first flowed thick, and\r\nblack, has begun to appear red and pellucid, there is then a sufficient\r\nquantity taken away, and what remains is pure: so that the arm is to be\r\nimmediately bound up, and kept so, till the cicatrice is firm; which\r\nfirmness it very soon acquires in a vein.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. XI.\r\n\r\nOF CUPPING.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are two sorts of cucurbitals: the one of copper, the other of\r\nhorn. That of copper is open at the one end, and close at the other;\r\nthat of horn is likewise open at one end, and at the other has a small\r\nhole. Into the copper one burning linen is put, and its mouth is clapt\r\nclose to the body, and is prest down, till it adhere to it. The horn\r\nkind is only applied to the body, and after that, when a person has\r\nsucked out the air by the small hole, and that is closed with wax, it\r\nsticks, as well as the other. Both of these are made not only of these\r\ntwo materials, but of any thing else. Where no better can be got, a\r\nsmall cup with a narrow mouth is fit enough for the purpose. When it\r\nadheres, if the skin has been cut before with a scalpel, it will bring\r\nout blood: if the skin is whole, air. Wherefore when the offence is\r\nfrom matter contained within, the first method is to be pursued: when\r\nit is only a flatulency, the other is commonly used.\r\n\r\nNow the principal use of a cucurbital is, when a disorder is not in the\r\nwhole body, but only in a part, the emptying of which is sufficient to\r\nrender it sound. And this very thing is a proof, that in the cure of\r\nany member, bleeding by a lancet too is to be performed rather in the\r\npart which is already hurt: because no body puts the cucurbital upon\r\na different part, unless to divert the flux of blood thither, but on\r\nthat, which is diseased, and which is to be relieved.\r\n\r\nThere may possibly be a necessity for using the cucurbital in chronic\r\ndistempers (although they be already of some standing) if there be\r\neither corrupted matter, or a flatulency. Likewise in some acute\r\ndistempers, if at the same time the body requires to be lightened, and\r\nthe strength will not admit of bleeding from a vein. And this remedy,\r\nas it is less violent, so it is more safe; and is never dangerous,\r\nthough it be made use of in the greatest violence of a fever, or even\r\nin the time of crudity. For this reason, when there is a necessity for\r\nbleeding, if the opening of a vein is very dangerous, or the disorder\r\nis fix’d in a noble part of the body, we must also have recourse to\r\nthis instrument. We must be sensible however, that as it is attended\r\nwith no danger, so it gives a feebler aid; and that is not possible to\r\nrelieve a violent distemper, but by an equally violent remedy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. XII.\r\n\r\nOF PURGING.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn almost every distemper the ancients endeavoured to purge by various\r\nmedicines and frequent clysters: and they gave either black hellebore,\r\nor polypody of the oak, or scales of copper(20), or the milk of\r\nsea-spurge(21), a drop of which taken upon bread purges plentifully;\r\nor asses, or cow’s, or goat’s milk, with the addition of a little salt;\r\nand this they boiled, and taking away what had been curdled, they\r\nobliged the patient to drink what remained like whey.\r\n\r\nBut generally _purging_ medicines injure the stomach. Wherefore aloes\r\nis to be mixed with all cathartics. If the purging be severe, or\r\nfrequent clysters be administered, it weakens a man. For that reason\r\nit is never proper in an illness to give medicines with that view,\r\nunless there be no fever concomitant: as when black hellebore is given\r\nto those that labour under atrabilis, or a melancholy madness, or any\r\nparalytic disorder. But where there are fevers, it is better to take\r\nsuch food and drink for that purpose, as may at once both nourish,\r\nand prove laxative. And there are some kinds of disorders, with which\r\npurging by milk agrees.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Of clysters._]\r\n\r\nBut for the most part the belly is to be opened by clysters. Which\r\nmethod, somewhat censured, though not entirely laid aside by\r\nAsclepiades, I observe to be generally neglected in our own age. That\r\nmoderation, which he seems to have followed, is most proper, that\r\nneither this remedy should be often tried, nor be entirely omitted, but\r\nused once, or at most twice, if the head is heavy, or the eyes dim;\r\nif there is a disorder of the large intestine, which the Greeks call\r\ncolon; if there are pains of the lower belly, or in the hips; if any\r\nthing bilious be accumulated in the stomach, or even any flux of phlegm\r\nor a humour like water thither; if the breathing is difficult; if there\r\nis no natural discharge from the belly; especially if the excrements\r\nare near the anus, and still remain within; or if the patient, while he\r\nhas no passage, nevertheless perceives the smell of excrements in his\r\nbreath; or if the stools appear corrupted; or if an early abstinence\r\nhas not removed a fever; or when a case may require bleeding, and the\r\nstrength will not allow of it, and the time for that operation is past;\r\nor if one has drank much before an illness; or if a person, who was\r\nfrequently loose, either naturally or by some accident, is suddenly\r\nbound in the belly. But the following rules are to be observed, that it\r\nbe not used before the third day; nor while any crudity remains; nor\r\nin a body weak and exhausted by long sickness; nor to a person, whose\r\nbelly discharges sufficiently every day, or one that is loose; nor\r\nduring the paroxysm of a fever; because what is injected at this time,\r\nis retained within the belly, and being thrown upon the head, greatly\r\nincreases the danger. On the day before, the patient ought to fast,\r\nthat he may be prepared for this remedy. On the day of the operation\r\nto drink, some hours before, hot water, that his superior parts may\r\nbe moistened; then the injection is to be performed with pure water,\r\nif we be content with a gentle medicine; if somewhat more powerful is\r\nrequired, hydromel(22); if a lenient, a decoction of fœnugreek, or\r\nptisan(23), or mallows, in water: if it be intended to restringe, a\r\ndecoction of vervains(24). Sea-water, or any other water with the\r\naddition of salt, is acrid: but both of these are better boiled. A\r\ngreater degree of acrimony is given by adding either oil, or nitre, or\r\nhoney also. The more acrid it is, it evacuates the more; but it is not\r\nso easy to bear. The injection ought neither to be cold, nor hot; lest\r\nit hurt either way. When it is injected, the patient ought to confine\r\nhimself as much as possible in bed, and not yield immediately to the\r\nfirst stimulus he finds to go to stool; and not till necessity obliges\r\nhim. And commonly this evacuation by lightning the superior parts\r\nmitigates the distemper itself. When a person has fatigued himself by\r\ngoing to stool, as often as he was obliged, he ought to take rest for a\r\nlittle time; and lest he grow faint, even on the same day to take food.\r\nThe quantity of which ought to be determined by considering the nature\r\nof the paroxysm that is expected; or whether there is no danger of any.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. XIII.\r\n\r\nOF VOMITING.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs a vomit even in health is often necessary to persons of a bilious\r\nhabit; it is likewise so in those distempers, which are occasioned\r\nby bile. Upon this account it is necessary to those, that before\r\nfevers are distressed with horrors and tremors; to all those, that\r\nlabour under a cholera; and all, that are attacked with madness, and a\r\nconcomitant mirth; and those also, who are oppressed with an epilepsy.\r\nBut if the distemper be acute, as the cholera; if it be a fever, while\r\nthere are tetani, the rougher medicines are improper, as has been\r\nobserved above in the article of purging; and it is sufficient to take\r\nsuch a vomit, as I prescribed for people in health. But when distempers\r\nare of long standing, and stubborn, without any fever, as an epilepsy\r\nor madness, we must use even white hellebore. Which it is not proper\r\nto administer in the winter, or summer; it is best in the spring: in\r\nthe autumn it does tolerably well. Whoever prescribes it, ought first\r\nto take care, that the body of his patient be moist. It is necessary\r\nto know, that every medicine of this kind, which is given by way of\r\npotion, is not always beneficial to sick people, to healthy always\r\nhurtful.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. XIV.\r\n\r\nOF FRICTION.\r\n\r\n\r\nConcerning friction(25), Asclepiades looking upon himself as the\r\ninventor of it, has said so much in that book, which he entitled ‘of\r\ngeneral remedies,’ that tho’ he mentions only three things, that, and\r\nwine, and gestation, yet he has taken up the greatest part of his\r\ntreatise upon the first. Now as it is not fit to defraud the moderns\r\nof the merit either of their new discoveries or judicious imitations,\r\n_so it is but just_ at the same time to assign those things, which were\r\npractised among some of the ancients, to their true authors. It cannot\r\nindeed be doubted, that Asclepiades has been both fuller and clearer\r\nin his directions, when and how friction ought to be used; but he has\r\ndiscovered nothing, which was not comprized in a few words by the\r\nmost ancient author Hippocrates; who said, that friction, if violent,\r\nhardens the body; if gentle, softens it; if plentiful, extenuates; if\r\nmoderate, increases its bulk: from whence it follows, that it is to be\r\nmade use of, when a lax body requires to be braced; or to soften one,\r\nthat is indurated; or to dissipate where the fulness is hurtful; or to\r\nnourish that, which is slender and infirm.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, if a person examine more curiously into these different\r\nspecies (which is not here the province of a physician) he will easily\r\nunderstand that the effects of them all proceed from one cause; that\r\nis, the carrying off of something. For a part will be bound, when that\r\nthing is taken away, the intervention of which had caused it to be\r\nlax; and another is softened by removing that, which occasioned the\r\nhardness; and the body is filled, not by the friction itself, but by\r\nthat food, which afterwards makes its way to the skin, relaxed by a\r\nkind of digestion(26). And the degree of it is the cause of these\r\neffects so widely different.\r\n\r\nBut there is a great deal of difference betwixt unction, and friction.\r\nFor it is necessary for the body to be anointed, and gently rubbed even\r\nin acute and recent distempers; but this must be done in the time\r\nof their remission, and before taking food. But to make use of long\r\nfriction is not proper, either in acute or increasing disorders; except\r\nwhen the intention of it is to procure sleep in phrenitic patients.\r\nThis remedy is very agreeable to inveterate distempers, and where they\r\nhave abated somewhat of their first violence. I am not ignorant that\r\nsome maintain, that every remedy is necessary for distempers, while\r\nthey are increasing, not when they are going off spontaneously. But\r\nthis is not just; for a distemper, though it would come to a period of\r\nitself, may notwithstanding be sooner terminated by the application of\r\nremedies. The use of which is necessary upon a double account, both\r\nthat the health may be restored as soon as possible; and that the\r\ndisorder, which remains, be not irritated again by any slight cause:\r\nfor a distemper may be less violent, than it has been, and yet not\r\nentirely removed; but there may be some remains of it, which the use of\r\nremedies may dissipate.\r\n\r\nBut though friction may be used in the decline of an illness, yet it\r\nis never to be practised in the increase of a fever; but if possible,\r\nwhen the body is entirely free of it; if that can’t be done, at least\r\nwhen there is a remission. It ought also to be performed sometimes over\r\nthe whole body, as when we would have an infirm person take on flesh;\r\nsometimes in particular parts, either because the weakness of that\r\npart itself, or of some other, requires it. For both inveterate pains\r\nof the head are mitigated by the friction of it (yet not during their\r\nviolence) and any paralytic limb is strengthened by rubbing it: but\r\nmuch more commonly, when one part is pained, a different one is to be\r\nrubbed; and particularly, when we want to make a derivation from the\r\nupper or middle parts of the body; and with this intention we rub the\r\nextremities. And these people are not to be regarded, who prescribe\r\nto a certain number, how often a person is to be rubbed: for that is\r\nto be estimated from his strength. Thus if one is very weak, fifty\r\ntimes may be sufficient: if of a more robust habit, it may be done two\r\nhundred times. And then _in different proportions_ betwixt these two\r\naccording to the strength. Whence it also happens, that the motion of\r\nthe hands in friction must be less frequent in a woman than a man;\r\nless frequent in a boy or an old man, than a young man. Lastly, if\r\nparticular parts are rubbed, they require much and strong friction.\r\nFor the whole body cannot be quickly weakened by a part, and there is\r\na necessity for dissipating as much of the matter as we can, whether\r\nthe intention be to relieve the part we brush, or another by means of\r\nit. But where a weakness of the whole body requires this treatment all\r\nover, it ought to be shorter and more mild; so as only to soften the\r\nsurface of the skin, to render it more apt to receive new matter from\r\nfresh nourishment. A patient is known to be in a bad situation, when\r\nthe surface of his body is cold, and the internal part is hot with a\r\nconcomitant thirst, as I observed above. But even in this case friction\r\nis the only remedy, which, if it have brought out the heat, may make\r\nway for the use of some medicine.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. XV.\r\n\r\nOF GESTATION.\r\n\r\n\r\nGestation is most proper for chronic distempers, and those that are\r\nalready upon the decline. And it is useful both to those, who are\r\nquite free of a fever, but yet are not able to exercise themselves;\r\nand those, that have the slow relicks of distempers, which are not\r\notherwise expelled. Asclepiades said, that gestation was to be used\r\neven in a recent and violent, and especially an ardent fever, in\r\norder to discuss it. But that is dangerous; and the violence of such\r\na distemper is sustained better by remaining quiet. Yet if any person\r\nwill make trial of it, he may do it under these circumstances, if his\r\ntongue is not rough, if there be no tumour, no hardness, no pain in his\r\nbowels, nor head, nor præcordia. And gestation ought never to be used\r\nat all in a body that is pained, whether in the whole, or in any part,\r\nunless the pain be in the nerves alone; and never in the increase of a\r\nfever, but upon its remission.\r\n\r\nThere are many kinds of gestation: in the use of which the strength\r\nand circumstances of the patient are to be considered; that they may\r\nneither dissipate too much a weak man, nor be out of the reach of one\r\nof small fortune. The most mild kind of gestation is in a ship, either\r\nin a port, or a river; or in a litter, or a chair; more brisk in a\r\nchariot; more violent in a ship on the ocean. And each of them may be\r\nrendered both more sharp, and more mild. If none of them can be done,\r\nthe bed must be suspended and moved to and fro. If even that can’t be\r\naccomplished, at least a prop is to be put under one foot(27) of the\r\nbed, and thus the bed moved back and forward by the hand. And indeed\r\nthe mild kinds of exercise agree with the weakest; the stronger with\r\nthose, who have been for several days free from the fever; or those,\r\nwho feel the beginnings of severe distempers, but are yet without a\r\nfever (which is the case in a consumption, and indispositions of the\r\nstomach, and a dropsical disorder, and sometimes in a jaundice) or when\r\nsome distempers, such as an epilepsy or madness, continue, though for a\r\nconsiderable time, without any concomitant fever. In which disorders,\r\nthese kinds of exercises also are necessary, which were mentioned in\r\nthat place, where we prescribed rules for the conduct of sound, but\r\nweakly men.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. XVI.\r\n\r\nOF ABSTINENCE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are two kinds of abstinence. One, when the patient takes no food\r\nat all: the other, when he takes only what is proper. The beginnings\r\nof diseases call for fasting and thirst: after that in the distempers\r\nthemselves moderation is required, so that nothing but what is proper\r\nbe taken, and not too much of that; for it is not fit after fasting,\r\nto enter immediately upon a full diet. And if this be hurtful even to\r\nsound bodies, that have been under the necessity of wanting food for\r\nsome time, how much more is it so to a weak, not to say a diseased one?\r\nAnd there is nothing which more relieves an indisposed person, than a\r\nseasonable abstinence. Intemperate men amongst us chuse for themselves\r\nthe seasons of eating, and leave the quantity of their food to the\r\nphysicians. Others again compliment the physicians with the times,\r\nbut reserve the quantity to their own determination. Those fancy\r\nthemselves to behave very genteelly, who leave every thing else to the\r\njudgment of the physicians, but insist upon the liberty of chusing the\r\nkind of their food; as if the question was, what the physician has a\r\nright to do, not what may be salutary to the patient; who is greatly\r\nhurt as often as he transgresses either in the time, measure, or\r\nquality of his food.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. XVII.\r\n\r\nOF SWEATING.\r\n\r\n\r\nA sweat is procured in two ways; either by a dry heat, or a bath. A\r\ndry heat is raised by hot sand, the laconicum, and clibanum(28), and\r\nsome natural sweating places, where a hot vapour exhaling out of the\r\nearth is inclosed by a building, as there is at Baiæ amongst the myrtle\r\ngroves. Besides these, it is solicited by the sun and exercise. These\r\nkinds are useful, wherever an internal humour offends, and is to be\r\ndissipated. Also some diseases of the nerves are best cured by this\r\nmethod. And the others may be proper for weak people: the heat of the\r\nsun and exercise agree only with the more robust; when they are falling\r\ninto a disorder, or even during the time of distempers not violent,\r\nprovided they be free of a fever. But care must be taken, that none of\r\nthese be attempted either in a fever(29), or in the time of crudity.\r\n\r\nBut the use of the bath is twofold. For sometimes after the removal\r\nof fevers, it is a proper introduction to a fuller diet and stronger\r\nwine for the recovery of health: sometimes it removes the fever itself.\r\nAnd it is generally used, when it is expedient to relax the surface\r\nof the skin, and solicit the evacuation of the corrupted humour, and\r\nto change the habit of the body. The ancients used it with greater\r\ncaution: Asclepiades more boldly. And there is no reason to be afraid\r\nof it, if it be seasonable: before the proper time, it does harm.\r\nWhoever has been freed of a fever, as soon as he has escaped the fit\r\nfor one day, on the day following, after the usual time of its coming\r\non, may safely bathe. And if the fever used to be periodical, so as to\r\nreturn upon the third or fourth day, whenever it has missed, the bath\r\nis safe. And even during the continuance of fevers, if they be of the\r\nslow kind, and the patients have splenetic disorders of long standing,\r\nit is proper to make trial of this remedy: on this condition however,\r\nthat the præcordia be not hard nor swelled, nor the tongue rough, and\r\nthere be no pain either in the trunk of the body or in the head, and\r\nthe fever be not then increasing. And in these fevers indeed, which\r\nhave a certain period, there are two opportunities for bathing; the\r\none, before the shuddering; the other, after the fit is ended. In those\r\nagain, who are long distressed with slow febriculas, either when the\r\nfit is entirely off; or if that does not happen, at least when it has\r\nremitted, and the body is as sound, as it generally is in that kind of\r\nillness.\r\n\r\nA valetudinary man, that is going into the bath, ought to be careful\r\nnot to expose himself to any cold before. When he has come to the\r\nbagnio, he is to stand still a little, and try whether his temples are\r\nbound, and if any sweat breaks out: if the first has happened, and the\r\nother not followed, the bath will be improper that day: he must be\r\nanointed slightly, and carried back, and by all means avoid cold, and\r\nbe abstemious. But if his temples are not affected, and a sweat begins,\r\nfirst there, and then elsewhere, he must wash his mouth with plenty of\r\nwarm water, then go into the bath; and there he must observe, whether\r\nat the first touch of the warm water he feels a shuddering upon the\r\nsurface of his skin; which can scarcely happen, if the circumstances\r\nabove-mentioned were as they should be: however, this is a certain sign\r\nof the bath’s being hurtful.\r\n\r\nOne from the state of his health may know, before he go into the warm\r\nwater, whether it be proper to anoint himself after it. However for the\r\nmost part (except in cases where it shall be expressly ordered to be\r\ndone after) upon the beginning of a sweat the body is to be anointed\r\ngently, and then to be dipped in the warm water. And in this case also\r\nregard must be had to his strength; and he must not be allowed to faint\r\nby the heat, but must be speedily removed, and carefully wrapped up\r\nin cloaths, lest any cold get to him; and there also he must sweat,\r\nbefore he take any food.\r\n\r\nWarm fomentations are millet-seed, salt, sand: any of these heated,\r\nand put into a linen cloth: even linen alone, if there be less heat\r\nrequired; but if greater, extinguished coals, wrapt up in cloths, and\r\napplied round a person. Moreover bottles(30) are filled with hot oil:\r\nand water is poured into earthen vessels, which from their resemblance\r\nin shape are called lenticulæ(31): and salt is put into a linen bag,\r\nand dipt into water well heated, then set upon the limb that is to be\r\nfomented. And at the fire are placed two ignited pieces of iron, with\r\npretty broad heads: one of these is put into dry salt, and water is\r\nsprinkled lightly upon it; when it begins to grow cold, it is carried\r\nback to the fire: the other is made use of in the same manner; so each\r\nof them alternately: and in the mean time, the hot and salt liquor\r\ndrops down through the cloth, which relieves the nerves contracted by\r\nany disease. All of them have this property in common of dissipating\r\nthat, which either loads the præcordia, or suffocates the fauces, or is\r\nhurtful in any limb. When each of these sorts of fomentations is to be\r\nused, shall be directed under the particular kinds of distempers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. XVIII.\r\n\r\nOF THE DIFFERENT KINDS OF FOOD AND DRINK.\r\n\r\n\r\nSince we have treated of those things, which relieve by evacuation,\r\nwe must now proceed to those, which nourish us, that is, our food and\r\ndrink. Now these are not only the common supports in all distempers,\r\nbut even of health too. And it is of importance to be acquainted with\r\nthe properties of them all: first, that the healthy may know, in what\r\nmanner they are to make use of them: secondly, that in treating of the\r\nmethod of curing diseases, it may suffice to mention in general the\r\nspecies of what is to be taken, without being under the necessity of\r\nnaming each particular upon every occasion.\r\n\r\nIt is fit to know then, that all leguminous vegetables, and those\r\ngrains, which are made into bread, are of the strongest kind of food\r\n(I call that the strongest, in which there is the most nourishment)\r\nalso every quadruped, that is tame, all large wild beasts, such as\r\nthe wild goat, deer, wild boar, wild ass; every great bird, such as\r\nthe goose, peacock, and crane; all large fishes, the cetus(32), and\r\nothers of a like size; also honey, and cheese. So that it is no wonder\r\nthat particular kind of bread(33) should be very strong, which is\r\nmade of corn, fat, honey, and cheese. Of a middle nature ought to be\r\nreckoned those pot-herbs, whose roots or bulbusses we use for food;\r\namongst quadrupeds the hare; all birds, from the least upwards to the\r\nphœnicopter(34); also all fish, that will not bear salt, or such, as\r\nare salted whole. Of the weakest kind are all potherbs, and whatever\r\ngrows on a stalk, such as the gourd, and cucumber, and caper, and all\r\nthe apple kind, olives, snails(35), and also conchylia(36).\r\n\r\nBut although these are thus distinguished, yet there are great\r\ndifferences between things even of the same class; and one is either\r\nmore substantial, or weaker than another. For instance, there is more\r\nnourishment in bread, than in any thing else. Wheat is more firm\r\nthan millet: and that again than barley: and the strongest kind of\r\nwheat is the siligo(37); after that the finest flour; next, that\r\nwhich has nothing taken from it, which the Greeks call autopyron[AX]:\r\nstill weaker than these is the second flour: the weakest is grey\r\nbread. Amongst the leguminous vegetables the bean or lentil is more\r\nsubstantial than pease. Amongst the potherbs, turnep and navew gentle,\r\nand all the bulbous kind (in which I rank the onion also, and garlick)\r\nare more substantial than the parsnip, or that which is particularly\r\ncalled radicula (garden radish.) Also cabbage, and betes, and leeks,\r\nare stronger than lettuce, or gourd, or asparagus. But amongst the\r\nfruits of the surculous tribe, grapes, figs, nuts, dates, apples\r\nproperly so called, are of the firmer kind. And amongst these the juicy\r\nare stronger than the mealy(38) fruits. Also of these birds, which\r\nare of the middle kind, those are stronger, which make more use of\r\ntheir feet, than their wings: and of those, that trust more to flying,\r\nthe larger birds are stronger than the small ones, as the beccaficos,\r\nand thrush(39). And those also, which live in the water, afford a\r\nlighter food than those, which cannot swim. Amongst the tame animals\r\npork is lightest; beef heaviest. Also of the wild, the larger any\r\nanimal is, so much the stronger food it is. And of those fishes also,\r\nwhich are of the middle kind, the heaviest, though we make most use of\r\nthem, are first all those, that are made salsamenta(40), such as the\r\nlacertus(41); next such, as though more tender than the other, yet\r\nare in themselves hard, as the aurata, corvus, sparus, oculata; in the\r\nnext rank are the plani fish, after which lighter still are lupi and\r\nmulli: and then all rock fish.\r\n\r\n  [AX] αὐτόπυρον.\r\n\r\nAnd there is not only a difference in the classes of things, but also\r\nin the things themselves; which arises from their age, the different\r\nparts of their body, the soil, air, and the case they are in. For every\r\nfour footed animal(42), that is sucking, affords less nourishment;\r\nalso a dunghill fowl, the younger it is. In fish too, the middle age,\r\nbefore they have reached their greatest bulk. _For the parts_, the\r\nheels, cheeks, ears, and brain of a hog; of a lamb or kid, the whole\r\nhead with the petty toes, are a good deal lighter than the other parts;\r\nso that they may be ranked in the middle class. In birds, the necks\r\nor wings are properly numbered with the weakest. As to the soil, the\r\ncorn, that grows upon hilly parts, is stronger than what grows upon a\r\nplain. Fish got in the midst of rocks, is lighter than those in the\r\nsand; those in the sand, than those in the mud. Whence it happens, that\r\nthe same kinds either from a pond, or lake, or river, are heavier: and\r\nthat, which lives in the deep, is lighter than one in shoal water.\r\nEvery wild animal also is lighter than a tame one: and whatever is\r\nproduced in a moist air, than another in a dry. In the next place, all\r\nthe same foods afford more nourishment, fat than lean; fresh more than\r\nsalt; new than stale. Again, the same thing nourishes more, when it\r\nis stewed into broth, than roasted, more roasted than fried. A hard\r\negg is of the strongest kind; soft, or sorbile(43) of the weakest.\r\nAnd though all grains, made into bread, are most firm, yet some kinds\r\nwashed, as alica(44), rice, ptisan, or gruel made of the same, or\r\npulse(45), and bread moistened with water, may be reckoned with the\r\nweakest.\r\n\r\nWith regard to drinks, whatever is prepared from grain, also milk,\r\nmulse, defrutum, passum(46), wine either sweet or strong, or\r\nmust, or very old wine, are of the strongest kind. But vinegar, and\r\nwine a few years old, or austere, or oily, is of the middle kind.\r\nAnd therefore none of these should be given to weak people. Water is\r\nweakest of all. And the drink, that is made of grain, is stronger in\r\nproportion to the hardness of the grain itself: and that wine, which is\r\nproduced in a good soil, more so than in a poor soil; or in a temperate\r\nair, than one, which is either over moist or too dry, and either over\r\ncold or too hot. Mulse, the more honey it contains, defrutum, the more\r\nit is evaporated in boiling, and passum, the drier the grape is from\r\nwhich it is prepared, are so much the stronger. Rain water is lightest;\r\nnext spring water, then river water, then that of a well; after these\r\nsnow, or ice; water of lakes is heavier than these; and that of fens\r\nheaviest of all. The trial is both easy and necessary to those, that\r\nwant to know its nature. For the lightness appears from weighing it;\r\nand amongst those, that are of equal weight, the sooner any of them\r\ngrows hot or cold, and the more quickly herbs are boiled in it, the\r\nbetter it is.\r\n\r\nIt is a general rule, that the stronger each kind is, so much the less\r\neasily it is concocted; but when once concocted, it nourishes more.\r\nWherefore the nature of the food must be determined by the degree\r\nof one’s strength; and the quantity proportioned to the kind. Upon\r\nthis account weak men must make use of the weakest things; a middle\r\nkind best supports those, that are moderately strong; and the most\r\nsubstantial is fittest for the robust. Lastly, A person may take a\r\ngreater quantity of what is lighter: but in what is most substantial,\r\nhe ought to moderate his appetite.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. XIX.\r\n\r\nGENERAL PROPERTIES OF DIFFERENT FOODS.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd these above-mentioned are not the only distinctions; but some\r\nthings afford good juices, others bad, which two kinds the Greeks\r\nterm euchyma and cacochyma[AY]; some are mild, others acrid; some\r\ngenerate in us a thicker phlegm, others a more fluid; some agree with\r\nthe stomach, others not; likewise some produce flatulencies, others\r\nhave not that property; some heat, others cool; some readily turn\r\nsour in the stomach, others are not easily corrupted there; some open\r\nthe belly, others bind it; some promote urine, others retard it; some\r\nare soporiferous, others excite the senses. Now all these must be\r\nknown for this reason, that different things are proper in different\r\nconstitutions or states of health.\r\n\r\n  [AY] εὔχυμα et κακόχυμα.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. XX.\r\n\r\nOF THINGS CONTAINING GOOD JUICES.\r\n\r\n\r\nGood juices are afforded by wheat, siligo, alica, rice, starch(47),\r\ntragum(48), milk, soft cheese, all venison, all birds of the middle\r\nclass; of the larger kind also, those that we mentioned above; the\r\nmiddle kind betwixt tender and hard fishes, as the mullus, and lupus;\r\npot-herbs, lettuce, nettle, mallows, cucumber, gourd, purslane, snails,\r\ndates; any of the apple kind, that are neither bitter, nor acid; wine\r\nsweet or mild, passum, defrutum, olives, or any of this fruit preserved\r\nin either of the two last mentioned liquors; the wombs(49), cheeks,\r\nand legs of hogs, all fat flesh, and glutinous, all livers, and a\r\nsorbile egg.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. XXI.\r\n\r\nOF FOODS CONTAINING BAD JUICES.\r\n\r\n\r\nOf bad juices are millet, panick, barley, leguminous vegetables, the\r\nflesh of tame animals very lean, and all salt meat, all salt fish\r\nand garum(50), old cheese, skirret, radish, turneps, navew gentle,\r\nbulbusses(51), cabbage, and more especially its sprouts, asparagus,\r\nbetes, cucumber, leek, rocket, cresses, thyme, catmint, savory, hyssop,\r\nrue, dill, fennel, cumin, anise, dock, mustard, garlick, onion,\r\nspleens, kidneys, intestines, every kind of apple, that is acid or\r\nbitter, vinegar, every thing, that is acrid, acid, or bitter, oil, also\r\nrock-fish, and those, that are of the tenderest kind, or those again,\r\nwhich are either too hard and strong tasted, as those found in ponds,\r\nlakes, or muddy rivers generally are, or those, that have grown to an\r\nexcessive bulk.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. XXII.\r\n\r\nOF MILD AND ACRID THINGS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following are mild; gruel, pulse, pancake(52), starch,\r\nptisan, fat flesh, and all glutinous flesh, such as we have in all\r\ntame animals, but especially in the heels, and legs of swine, the\r\npetty-toes, and heads of kids, calves, and lambs, and the brains of\r\nthem all. Also milk, and what are properly called sweets, defrutum,\r\npassum, pine-nuts.\r\n\r\nThings acrid are, whatever is too austere, all acids, all salt\r\nprovisions; and even honey, which is the more so, the better it is:\r\nlikewise garlick, onion, rocket, rue, cresses, cucumber, bete, cabbage,\r\nasparagus, mustard, radish, endive, basil, lettuce, and the greatest\r\npart of pot-herbs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. XXIII.\r\n\r\nOF THOSE THINGS WHICH GENERATE A THICK AND A FLUID PHLEGM.\r\n\r\n\r\nA thick phlegm is generated by sorbile eggs, alica, rice, starch,\r\nptisan, milk, bulbous roots, and almost every thing that is glutinous.\r\n\r\nThe contrary effect is produced by all salted, and acrid, and acid\r\nsubstances.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. XXIV.\r\n\r\nOF WHAT AGREES WITH THE STOMACH.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhatever is austere or acid, or whatever is moderately sprinkled with\r\nsalt, is agreeable to the stomach: also un-leavened bread, and washed\r\nalica, or rice, or ptisan; and all birds, and all venison; and both\r\nof these either roasted or boiled: amongst the tame animals, beef;\r\nif any of the rest is made use of, rather lean than fat; in a swine\r\nthe heels, cheeks, ears, and barren wombs; amongst pot-herbs endive,\r\nlettuce, parsnip, boiled gourd, skirret; of the apple kind, the\r\ncherry, mulberry, service fruit, mealy pears, such as are either those\r\ncalled crustumina(53) or næviana, also those called tarentina, or\r\nsignina; the round apples, or scandiana, or amerina, or quinces, or\r\npomegranates, wormwood(54), jar raisins, soft eggs, dates, pine-nuts,\r\nwhite olives preserved in strong brine or tinctured with vinegar, or\r\nthe black kind, which have grown thoroughly ripe upon the tree, or\r\nbeen kept in passum or defrutum; austere wine, although it be grown\r\nrough, also resinated(55); hard fish of the middle class, oysters,\r\npectines(56), murex and purpura(57), periwinkles; food and drink\r\neither cold or hot.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. XXV.\r\n\r\nOF THINGS HURTFUL TO THE STOMACH.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe stomach is offended by every thing tepid, all salt provisions, all\r\nmeat stewed into broth, every thing too sweet, all fat substances,\r\ngruel, leavened bread, and the same made either from millet or barley,\r\noil, roots of pot-herbs, and whatever greens are eaten with oil or\r\ngarum, honey, mulse, defrutum, passum, milk, all cheese, fresh grapes,\r\nfigs both green and dry, all leguminous vegetables, and things, that\r\nusually prove flatulent; also thyme, catmint, savory, hyssop, cresses,\r\ndock, nipplewort, and walnuts. From this account it may be inferred,\r\nthat it is no rule that what affords a good juice, agrees with the\r\nstomach; nor that what agrees with the stomach, is for that reason of\r\ngood juice.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. XXVI.\r\n\r\nOF THOSE THINGS, WHICH OCCASION FLATULENCIES, AND THE CONTRARY.\r\n\r\n\r\nFlatulencies are generated by almost all the leguminous vegetables,\r\nevery thing fat, or over sweet, all stewed meat; must, and even any\r\nwine, that has not got age: amongst pot-herbs, garlick, onion, cabbage,\r\nand all roots (except skirret and parsnip) bulbusses, dry figs too, but\r\nmore especially the green, fresh grapes, all nuts, except pine-nuts,\r\nmilk, and all cheese, and lastly, whatever is too crude.\r\n\r\nLittle or no flatulency is occasioned by venison, wild fowl, fish,\r\napples, olives, conchylia, eggs either soft or sorbile, old wine. But\r\nfennel and dill even relieve flatulencies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. XXVII.\r\n\r\nOF THOSE THINGS WHICH HEAT AND COOL.\r\n\r\n\r\nHeat is excited by pepper, salt, all flesh stewed into soup, garlick,\r\nonion, dry figs, salt fish, wine which is the more heating, the\r\nstronger it is.\r\n\r\nThose greens are cooling, whose stalks are eaten without boiling, as\r\nendive, and lettuce: likewise coriander, cucumber, boiled gourd, bete,\r\nmulberries, cherries, austere apples, mealy pears, boiled flesh, and\r\nespecially vinegar mixed either with meat or drink.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. XXVIII.\r\n\r\nOF WHAT IS EASILY CORRUPTED IN THE STOMACH, AND THE CONTRARY.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following kinds easily corrupt in the stomach, leavened bread, and\r\nsuch as is made of any other grain than wheat, and all kinds of the\r\nsweet bread mentioned before(58), milk, honey, also sucking animals,\r\nand tender fish, oysters, greens, cheese both new and old, coarse or\r\ntender flesh, sweet wine, mulse, defrutum passum; lastly, whatever is\r\neither juicy, or too sweet, or over thin.\r\n\r\nBut unleavened bread, birds, especially the harder, hard fish, and not\r\nonly the aurata for instance, or scarus(59), but even the lolligo,\r\nlocusta, polypus, do not easily corrupt; also beef and all hard flesh:\r\nthe same is preferable if it be lean, and salted; and all salt fish;\r\nperiwinkles, the murex and purpura, austere wine, or resinated.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. XXIX.\r\n\r\nOF WHAT OPENS THE BELLY.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe belly is opened by leavened bread, and the more so if it be\r\ncoarse, or made of barley; cabbage if it be not well boiled, lettuce,\r\ndill, cresses, basil, nettle, purslane, radishes, capers, garlick,\r\nonion, mallows, dock, bete, asparagus, gourd, cherries, mulberries,\r\nall mild apples, figs even dry, but more especially green, fresh\r\ngrapes, fat small birds, periwinkles, salt fish and garum, oysters,\r\npelorides(60), sea-urchins, muscles, and almost all shell fish, and\r\nchiefly the liquor of them, rock fish, and all tender fish, blood of\r\nthe cuttle fish; and any fat meat, and the same stewed, or boiled;\r\nbirds that swim; crude honey, milk, all sucking animals, mulse, sweet\r\nor salt wine, soft water(61), every thing tepid, sweet, fat, boiled,\r\nstewed, salt, or diluted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. XXX.\r\n\r\nOF WHAT BINDS THE BELLY.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the contrary the belly is bound by bread made of the siligo, or\r\nflour of wheat; especially if it be unleavened; and more so if it be\r\nalso toasted: and this virtue is even increased, if it be twice baked:\r\npulse made either from alica, or panick, or millet; also gruel prepared\r\nfrom the same; and more so, if these have been toasted first. Lentils\r\nwith the addition of betes, or endive, or cichory, or plantain, and\r\nmore so, if these have been toasted before: endive also by itself or\r\ncichory toasted, with plantain; small greens, cabbage twice boiled;\r\nhard eggs, and more so if roasted; small birds, black bird, ring-dove,\r\nespecially boiled in vinegar and water, crane and all birds that run,\r\nmore than they fly; hare, wild goat; the liver of those animals, that\r\nhave suet, especially that of beef, and the suet itself; cheese, which\r\nis grown strong by age, or by that change, which we observe in the\r\nforeign kind; or if it be new, boiled with honey or mulse; also boiled\r\nhoney, unripe pears, fruit of the service-tree, more especially those\r\nthat they call torminalia(62), quinces and pomegranates, olives\r\neither white or early ripe, myrtle-berries, dates, the purpura and\r\nmurex, wine either resinated or rough, and wine undiluted, vinegar,\r\nmulse, that has been boiled, also rough defrutum, passum, water either\r\ntepid or very cold, and hard, that is, such as keeps long without\r\nstinking, therefore particularly rain water, every thing hard, lean,\r\naustere, rough, and scorched, and the same flesh rather roasted, than\r\nboiled.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. XXXI.\r\n\r\nOF DIURETIC MEATS AND DRINKS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe urine is promoted by whatever grows in the garden of a good smell,\r\nas smallage, rue, dill, basil, mint, hyssop, anise, coriander,\r\ncresses, rocket, fennel. Besides these, asparagus, caper, catmint,\r\nthyme, savory, nipplewort, parsnip, especially the wild kind, radish,\r\nskirret, onion; of venison principally the hare; small wine, pepper\r\nboth round and long, mustard, wormwood, pine-nuts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. XXXII.\r\n\r\nOF SOPORIFEROUS AND EXCITING THINGS.\r\n\r\n\r\nSleep is procured by the poppy, lettuce, especially the summer kind,\r\nwhen its stalk is replete with milk, mulberries, and leeks.\r\n\r\nThe senses are excited by catmint, thyme, savory, hyssop, particularly\r\npennyroyal, rue and onion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. XXXIII.\r\n\r\nOF THOSE THINGS, WHICH DRAW, REPEL, OR COOL, OR HEAT, OR HARDEN, OR\r\nSOFTEN.\r\n\r\n\r\nMany things are powerful in drawing out matter: but as these consist\r\nprincipally of foreign medicines, and not so much adapted to the\r\ncases of those who are to be relieved by diet, I shall postpone the\r\nmention of them for the present: and shall only name those things,\r\nwhich are commonly at hand, and are fit for corroding, and thus\r\nextracting whatever is hurtful in those distempers, concerning which\r\nI am presently to treat. This virtue resides in the seeds of rocket,\r\ncresses, radish; but most of all mustard. The same power is also found\r\nin salt, and figs.\r\n\r\nSordid wool(63) dipt either in vinegar, or wine, with an addition of\r\noil; bruised dates, bran boiled in salt water or vinegar, are all at\r\nthe same time both restringent and emollient.\r\n\r\nBut the following things both restringe and cool, the wall herb (which\r\nthey call parthenium or perdicium, _feverfew_) serpyllum, pennyroyal,\r\nbasil, the blood herb (which the Greeks call polygonon[AZ],) purslane,\r\npoppy-leaves, and clippings of vines, coriander-leaves, henbane, moss,\r\nskirret, smallage, nightshade (which the Greeks call struchnos)[BA],\r\ncabbage-leaves, endive, plantain, fenel-seed, mashed pears or apples,\r\nchiefly quinces, lentils; cold water, especially rain water, wine,\r\nvinegar; and bread, or meal, or sponge, or pieces of cloth, or sordid\r\nwool, or even linen, moistened in any of these liquors; Cimolian\r\nchalk(64), tarras(65), oil of quinces(66), or myrtles(67), or\r\nof roses(68), bitter oil(69), leaves of vervains bruised with their\r\ntender stalks; of this kind are olive, cypress, myrtle, mastich-tree,\r\ntamarisk, privet, rose, bramble, laurel, ivy, pomegranate.\r\n\r\n  [AZ] πολύγονον.\r\n\r\n  [BA] στρύχνος.\r\n\r\nBoiled quinces, pomegranate bark, a hot decoction of vervains, which\r\nI mentioned before, powder from the lees of wine, or myrtle-leaves,\r\nbitter almonds, all restringe without cooling.\r\n\r\nA cataplasm made from any meal is heating, whether it be of wheat,\r\nor of far(70), or barley, or bitter vetch, or darnel, or millet,\r\nor panick, or lentil, or beans, or lupines, or lint, or fenugreek;\r\nthe meal after being boiled is laid on hot. But every kind of meal\r\nboiled in mulse is more effectual for this purpose, than the same\r\nprepared with water. Besides these, Cyprine oil(71), or iris(72),\r\nmarrow, fat of a cat, mixed with oil, especially if it be old, salt,\r\nnitre(73), git, pepper, cinquefoil.\r\n\r\nAnd _we may observe_ in general, that those things, which both\r\nrestringe violently and cool, are hardening: and those which heat and\r\ndissipate, are softening: but the most powerful cataplasm for softening\r\nis made from the seeds of lint or fenugreek.\r\n\r\nNow physicians make use of all these things variously, both by\r\nthemselves, and mixed; so that we rather see what each of them was\r\nstrongly persuaded of, than what upon certain trial he found to be\r\nuseful.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA. CORNELIUS CELSUS\r\n\r\n        OF\r\n\r\n     MEDICINE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_BOOK III._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. I.\r\n\r\nGENERAL DIVISION OF DISTEMPERS.\r\n\r\n\r\nHaving already considered all that relates to distempers in general, I\r\ncome to treat of the cure of each distinctly. Now the Greeks divided\r\nthem into two kinds, the one they called acute, the other chronic. And\r\nbecause their process was not always the same, for this reason some\r\nranged the same distempers among the acute, which others reckoned in\r\nthe number of the chronic. From whence it is plain, that there are more\r\nkinds of them. For some are short and acute, which either carry off a\r\nperson quickly, or are themselves soon terminated. Others are of long\r\ncontinuance, from which there is neither a speedy recovery, nor speedy\r\ndeath. And the third kind are those, which are sometimes acute, and\r\nsometimes chronic; and this happens not only in fevers, where it is\r\nmost frequent; but also in other diseases. And besides these, there is\r\na fourth kind; which can neither be called acute, because they are not\r\nmortal; nor yet chronic, because if remedies are used, they are easily\r\ncured. When I come to treat of each, I shall point out to what kind\r\nthey belong.\r\n\r\nNow I shall divide all of them into those, that seem to affect the\r\nwhole body, and those, which occur in particular parts. After a few\r\ngeneral observations upon them all, I shall begin with the first.\r\nThough there is no distemper in which fortune can pretend to more\r\npower than art, or art than nature; since medicine can do nothing in\r\nopposition to nature: yet a physician is more excusable for want of\r\nsuccess in acute, than in chronic disorders. For in the first, there is\r\nbut a small space, within which, if the remedies do not succeed, the\r\npatient dies: in the other case, there is time both for deliberation,\r\nand a change of medicines; so that very seldom, where a physician is\r\ncalled at its beginning, an obedient patient is lost without his fault.\r\nNevertheless, a chronic distemper, when it is firmly rooted, becomes\r\nequally difficult with an acute one. And indeed the older an acute\r\ndistemper is, so much the more easily it is cured; but a chronic one,\r\nthe more recent it is.\r\n\r\nThere is another thing we ought not to be ignorant of; that the\r\nsame remedies don’t agree with all patients. Whence it happens,\r\nthat the greatest authors extol some one remedy, some another, each\r\nrecommending his own as the only one, according as they had succeeded\r\nwith themselves. It is fit therefore, when any thing does not answer,\r\nnot to pay so much regard to the author of it, as to the patient, and\r\nto make trial of one thing after another. _Remembering_ however, that\r\nin acute distempers, what does not relieve, must be quickly changed:\r\nin the chronic, which time both causes, and removes, whatever has not\r\nimmediately done service, is not to be hastily condemned; much less\r\nmust that be discontinued, which does but give a small relief, because\r\nits good effects are completed by time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. II.\r\n\r\nGENERAL DIAGNOSTICS OF ACUTE AND CHRONIC, INCREASING AND DECLINING\r\nDISEASES; THE DIFFERENCE OF REGIMEN IN EACH; AND PRECAUTIONS NECESSARY\r\nUPON THE APPREHENSION OF AN APPROACHING ILLNESS.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is easy to know in the beginning, whether a distemper be acute, or\r\nchronic: not in those only, that are always the same; but in those\r\nalso, that vary. For when the paroxysms and violent pains without\r\nintermissions distress, the disease is acute. When the pains are\r\ngentle, or the fever slow, and there are considerable intervals betwixt\r\nthe fits, and those symptoms accede, which have been explained in\r\nthe preceding book, it is plain, that the distemper will be of long\r\ncontinuance.\r\n\r\nIt is necessary also to observe, whether the distemper increases, or is\r\nat a stand, or abates: because some remedies are proper for disorders\r\nincreasing, more for those, that are upon the decline. And those,\r\nwhich are suitable to increasing disorders, when an acute distemper\r\nis gaining ground, ought rather to be tried in the remissions. Now a\r\ndistemper increases, while the pains and paroxysms grow more severe;\r\nwhen the paroxysms return after a shorter interval, and last longer\r\nthan the preceding did. And even in chronic disorders, that have not\r\nsuch marks, we may know them to be increasing, if sleep is uncertain,\r\nif concoction grows worse, if the intestinal excretion is more fetid,\r\nif the senses are more heavy, the understanding more slow, if cold or\r\nheat runs over the body, if the skin grows more pale. But the contrary\r\nsymptoms to these are marks of its decrease.\r\n\r\nBesides in acute distempers, the patient must not be allowed\r\nnourishment so soon, not till they be upon the decline; that fasting by\r\na diminution of matter may break its violence; in chronic disorders,\r\nsooner, that he may be able to endure the continuance of the disease.\r\nBut if the distemper happens not to be in the whole body, but only in\r\na particular part, yet it is more necessary to support the strength of\r\nthe whole body, than of the part; since by means of that _strength_ the\r\ndiseased parts may be cured. It also makes a great difference, whether\r\na person has been properly or wrong treated from the beginning: because\r\na method of cure is less successful, where it has been often applied\r\nunsuccessfully. If one has been injudiciously treated, but still\r\npossesses his natural strength, he is quickly restored by a proper\r\nmanagement.\r\n\r\nBut since I began with those symptoms, which afford marks of an\r\napproaching illness, I shall commence the methods of cure from the\r\nsame period. Wherefore if any of those things(1), which have been\r\nmentioned, happen, rest and abstinence are best of all: if any thing is\r\ndrunk, it should be water; and sometimes it is sufficient to do that\r\nfor one day; sometimes for two days, if the alarming symptoms continue;\r\nand immediately after fasting, very little food must be taken, water\r\nmust be drunk; the day after, wine; then every other day by turns\r\nwater and wine, till all cause of fear be removed. For by these means\r\noften a dangerous distemper impending is averted. And a great many are\r\ndeceived, while they hope upon the first day immediately to remove a\r\nlangour either by exercise, or bathing, or a gentle purge, or vomiting,\r\nor sweating, or drinking wine. Not but this may sometimes happen, or\r\nanswer their expectations, but that it more frequently fails; and\r\nabstinence alone may cure without any danger. Especially as that may\r\nbe regulated according to the degree of one’s apprehensions: and if\r\nthe symptoms are slight, it is sufficient only to abstain from wine; a\r\ndiminution of which assists more than lessening the quantity of food:\r\nif they are somewhat more dangerous, it may serve the turn not only to\r\ndrink water (_as in the first case_), but to forbear flesh too: and\r\nsometimes to take less bread than ordinary, and confine one’s self to\r\nmoist food, especially greens. And it may be sufficient then only to\r\nabstain entirely from food, wine and all motion, when violent symptoms\r\ngive the alarm. And without doubt scarce any body will fall into a\r\ndistemper, who does not neglect it, but takes care by these means to\r\noppose its beginning in due time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. III.\r\n\r\nOF THE SEVERAL KINDS OF FEVERS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThese are the rules to be observed by such as are in health, that are\r\nonly apprehensive of the cause. We next proceed to the cure of fevers,\r\nwhich is a kind of disease, that affects the whole body, and is the\r\nmost common of all. Of these one is a quotidian, another a tertian, and\r\na third a quartan. Sometimes some fevers also return after a longer\r\nperiod, but that seldom occurs. With regard to the former, they are\r\nboth diseases _in themselves_, and a cure _for others_.\r\n\r\nBut quartan fevers are more simple. They begin commonly with a\r\nshuddering; then a heat breaks out; after the paroxysm is over, the\r\npatient is well for two days. So that it returns upon the fourth day.\r\n\r\nOf tertians again there are two kinds. One of them both beginning and\r\nending like the quartan; with this difference only, that there is one\r\nday’s intermission, and it returns upon the third. The other kind\r\nis much more fatal, which indeed returns upon the third day, but of\r\nforty-eight hours, thirty-six are occupied by the fit (and sometimes\r\neither less or more,) nor does it entirely cease in the remission; but\r\nis only mitigated. This kind most physicians call semitertian[BB].\r\n\r\n  [BB] ἑμιτριτα̃ιος.\r\n\r\nBut quotidians are various, and different in their appearances. For\r\nsome of them begin with a heat, others with a coldness, others with a\r\nshuddering. I call that a coldness, when the extremities of the limbs\r\nare chilled; a shuddering, when the whole body trembles. Again, some\r\nend, so as to be followed by an interval quite free from indisposition;\r\nothers so, as that though the fever somewhat abates, yet some relicks\r\nremain, till another paroxysm comes on; and others often remit little\r\nor nothing, but continue as they began. Some again are attended with a\r\nvery vehement heat, others more tolerable; some are equal every day,\r\nothers unequal, and alternately milder one day and more severe another:\r\nsome return at the same time the following day, others either later\r\nor sooner: some by the fit and the intermission take up a day and a\r\nnight, some less, others more: some, when they go off, cause a sweat,\r\nothers do not; and in some a sweat leaves the patient well, in others\r\nit only renders the body weaker: sometimes also one fit comes on each\r\nday, sometimes two or more. Whence it frequently happens, that every\r\nday there are several both paroxysms and remissions; yet so as that\r\neach of them answers to some preceding one. Sometimes too the fits are\r\nso irregular, that neither their durations nor intermissions can be\r\nobserved. Nor is it true, which is alledged by some, that no fever is\r\nirregular, unless it arise from a vomica, or an inflammation, or an\r\nulcer. For the cure would always be easier, if this were fact. For what\r\nis occasioned by the evident causes, may also proceed from the occult.\r\nNor do those dispute about things, but words, who alledge, that when\r\nfeverish paroxysms come on in different manners in the same distemper,\r\nthese are not irregular returns of the fever, but new and different\r\nfevers successively arising. Which however would have no relation\r\nto the method of cure, though it were true. The intervals also are\r\nsometimes pretty long, at other times scarce perceptible.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. IV.\r\n\r\nOF THE DIFFERENT METHODS OF CURE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis then is the general nature of fevers. But the methods of cure\r\ndiffer, according to their different authors. Asclepiades says, that\r\nit is the duty of a physician to effect the cure safely, speedily,\r\nand with ease _to the patient_. This is to be desired: but generally\r\ntoo great haste and too great indulgence both prove dangerous. What\r\nmoderation must be used in order to obtain all these ends as far as\r\npossible, the principal regard being always had to the safety _of\r\nthe patient_, will come into consideration, when we treat of the\r\nparticulars of the cure.\r\n\r\nAnd the first inquiry is, how the patient is to be treated in the\r\nbeginning of the distemper. The ancients by the use of some medicines\r\nendeavoured to promote concoction; for this reason, that they were\r\nextremely afraid of crudity: next they discharged by frequent clysters\r\nthat matter, which seemed to hurt. Asclepiades laying aside the use of\r\nmedicines, ordered clysters not so frequently as they, but in almost\r\nevery distemper. And he professed his principal cure for a fever was\r\nthe disease itself. He thought also, that the strength of the patient\r\nwas to be worn out by light, watching, and great thirst: insomuch that\r\nhe would not even allow the mouth to be washed in the first days.\r\nSo much are those mistaken, who imagine the whole of his regimen to\r\nbe agreeable. For indeed in the advance of the distemper he even\r\nadministered to the luxury of the patient; but at the beginning he\r\nacted the part of a tormentor.\r\n\r\nNow I grant that medicinal potions and clysters, ought to be used but\r\nsparingly. And yet I do not think these are to be administered with a\r\nview to destroy the patient’s strength: because the greatest danger\r\narises from weakness. Wherefore it is proper only to diminish the\r\nredundant matter; which is naturally dissipated, when there is no new\r\naccession to it. For this reason the patient must abstain from food in\r\nthe beginning, and in the day-time be kept in the light, unless he be\r\nweak, because even that contributes to the discharge. And he ought to\r\nlye in a very large room.\r\n\r\nAs to thirst and sleep, the best mean is, that he be awake in the\r\nday-time, and rest in the night, if possible; and neither drink\r\nplentifully, nor be too much tormented with thirst. His mouth also\r\nmay be washed, when it is both dry, and has a fetid taste; although\r\nsuch time is not seasonable for drinking. And Erasistratus very justly\r\nobserved, that often the mouth and fauces require moisture, when\r\nthere is no want of it in the internal parts; and that it is of no\r\nconsequence, that the patient is uneasy. Such then ought to be the\r\ntreatment at first.\r\n\r\nNow the best medicine is food seasonably administered: when that must\r\nbe given first, is a question. Most of the ancients were slow in giving\r\nit; often on the fifth or sixth day: and that perhaps the nature of the\r\nclimate in Asia or in Egypt admits of. Asclepiades, after he had for\r\nthree days fatigued the patient in every way, appointed the fourth for\r\nfood. But Themison of late considered, not when the fever had begun,\r\nbut when it had gone off, or at least was abated; and waiting for the\r\nthird day from that time, if the fever had not returned, he gave food\r\nimmediately; if it did come on, when it had ceased; or if it continued\r\nconstantly, when at least it was mitigated.\r\n\r\nNow none of these rules is always to be followed. For it may be proper\r\nto give food on the first day, it may on the second, it may on the\r\nthird, it may not before the fourth or fifth; it may after one fit,\r\nit may after two, it may after several. For the qualities of the\r\ndistemper, constitution, air, age, and season of the year make some\r\ndifference. And no time can be universally fixed in things so widely\r\ndifferent from each other. In a distemper that weakens more, food must\r\nbe sooner allowed; also in an air that is more dissipating. Upon this\r\naccount in Africa for no day it seems proper to prescribe fasting. It\r\nshould be given also sooner to a boy, than a young man; more quickly\r\nin summer, than winter. This one thing must be practised always and\r\nevery where, that a physician sitting by should now and then observe\r\nthe strength of the patient, and as long as that continues, encounter\r\nthe disease by abstinence; if he begins to apprehend weakness, support\r\nhim by food. For it is his business to be careful neither to load the\r\npatient by superfluous matter, nor when he is weaker, to kill him by\r\nfasting. And this I find in Erasistratus, who though he did not direct,\r\nwhen the belly, when the body itself was to be evacuated, yet by saying\r\nthat these were to be regarded, and that food was to be given, when the\r\nbody stood in need of it, has plainly enough shewn, that it ought not\r\nto be given, while there w as a sufficient quantity of strength, and\r\nthat care should be taken, that it was not too much exhausted.\r\n\r\nFrom these things it may be inferred, that many people cannot be\r\nattended by one physician; and that the man to be trusted is he, that\r\nknows his profession, and is not much absent from the patient. But\r\nthey, that practise only from views of gain, because their profits\r\narise in proportion to the number of patients, readily fall in with\r\nsuch rules, as do not require close attendance; as in this very case.\r\nFor it is easy even for such, as seldom see the patient, to count the\r\ndays and the fits: but it is necessary for him to sit by his patient,\r\nwho would form a true judgment what is alone fit to be done; when he\r\nwill be too weak unless he get food. In most people however the fourth\r\nday is usually the most proper for beginning to give food.\r\n\r\nBut there is still another doubt about the days themselves, because the\r\nancients chiefly regarded the odd days, and called them critical[BC],\r\nas if on these a judgment was to be formed concerning the patients.\r\nThese days were the third, fifth, seventh, ninth, eleventh, fourteenth,\r\nand twenty-first; so that the greatest influence was attributed to the\r\nseventh, next to the fourteenth, and then to the twenty-first. And\r\ntherefore with regard to the nourishment of the sick, they waited for\r\nthe fits of the odd days: then afterwards they gave food, expecting\r\nthe approaching fits to be easier; insomuch that Hippocrates, if the\r\nfever had ceased on any other day, used to be apprehensive of a relapse.\r\n\r\n  [BC] κρισίμοι.\r\n\r\nThis Asclepiades justly rejected as idle, and said that no day was more\r\nor less dangerous to the patients, by its being either even or odd.\r\nFor sometimes the even days are worse; and food is given more properly\r\nafter the paroxysm of the fevers: sometimes also in the same distemper\r\nthe quality of the days is changed: and that becomes more severe,\r\nwhich had used to be more mild: and the fourteenth day itself is even,\r\nupon which the ancients laid a great stress. And when they maintained,\r\nthat the eighth was of the same nature with the first, because the\r\nsecond number of seven began from it, they were inconsistent with\r\nthemselves in not taking the eighth, or tenth, or twelfth day, as the\r\nmore important: for they attributed more to the ninth and eleventh.\r\nWhen they had done this without any plausible reason, they passed on\r\nfrom the eleventh, not to the thirteenth, but to the fourteenth. It is\r\na remark of Hippocrates too, that the fourth day is worst to him, that\r\nis to be relieved on the seventh. So that even by his own account, upon\r\nan even day both the fever may be more violent, and a sure indication\r\ngiven of what is to follow. And the same author elsewhere takes every\r\nfourth day to have the strongest influence with regard to both events;\r\nthat is the fourth, seventh, eleventh, fourteenth, seventeenth: in\r\nwhich he passes from the odd to the even reckoning. Neither in this\r\nindeed has he kept to his point: since the eleventh is not the fourth,\r\nbut the fifth day after the seventh. Whence it appears, in whatever\r\nlight we consider the number, no true reasoning can be found in his\r\ndoctrine. But with regard to these the ancients were misled by the\r\nPythagoric numbers at that time in great vogue: whereas here as well as\r\nin other cases a physician ought not to count the days, but to consider\r\nthe paroxysms themselves; and upon them to found his conjecture when\r\nfood is to be given.\r\n\r\nBut this is of more importance, to know whether the proper time for\r\ngiving food be, when the tumultuous motion of the vessels has pretty\r\nmuch subsided, or while some relicks of the fever still remain. For the\r\nancients prescribed nourishment, when the body was in the soundest\r\nstate: Asclepiades, upon the decline of the fit, but before it was\r\nover; his reason for which was weak; not but that food is to be given\r\nsometimes more quickly, if another paroxysm is apprehended soon; but\r\nbecause certainly it ought not to be given, but when the body is in\r\nits best condition: for what is received by a body free from disorder\r\nis less liable to corruption. Neither is it true, which Themison\r\nimagined, if a patient was to be well for two hours, that it would be\r\nbetter to give it then, that it might be digested(2), while the body\r\nwas in health. Indeed if it could be so speedily digested, that would\r\nbe best. But as so short a time is not sufficient, it is better that\r\nthe beginning of food should be upon the end of one paroxysm, than\r\nthat any of it should lie in the stomach, when another begins. Thus\r\nif a pretty long interval is to follow, it is to be given, when the\r\nperson is freest of all indisposition; if but a short one, before the\r\npatient be quite well. What has been said of the sound state during an\r\nintermission, holds likewise with respect to the greatest remission\r\nwe find in a continued fever. But it is also a question, whether it\r\nis necessary to wait so many hours, as use to be taken up by the fit;\r\nor whether it is sufficient to pass over the first part of them, that\r\nthose patients may be more easy, who sometimes have not a perfect\r\nintermission. But it is most safe to suffer the whole time of the fit\r\nto be over first: although when the paroxysm has been long, the patient\r\nmay be indulged sooner; nevertheless so that at least the one half be\r\nsuffered to elapse first. And this is not only to be observed in the\r\nkind last mentioned, but in all fevers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. V.\r\n\r\nPARTICULAR DIRECTIONS FOR THE GIVING OF FOOD IN THE DIFFERENT SPECIES\r\nOF FEVERS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThese observations are of a more general nature belonging to all kinds\r\nof fevers: I shall now descend to the particular species of them.\r\nWherefore if there has been only one fit, which has gone off, and that\r\narose either from the inguen(3), or from fatigue, or from heat,\r\nor from some such accident, so that there is no reason to apprehend\r\ndanger from any internal cause, the following day, when the time of\r\nthe fit has passed without any disorder, food may be given. But if the\r\nheat come from within; and a heaviness of the head or præcordia has\r\nfollowed; and there is no apparent cause for the disturbance of the\r\nbody; although health has followed one fit, yet because a tertian may\r\nbe apprehended, the third day is to be expected; and when the time for\r\nthe fit is over, food is to be given, but very little of it; because\r\na quartan may also be feared. But upon the fourth day, if the body\r\nis well, it may be freely used. If indeed the paroxysm has followed\r\nupon the second, third, or fourth day, then we may conclude it to be a\r\ndisease. But the method of cure in tertians and quartans (whose periods\r\nare certain, whose fits leave no indisposition, and the intervals are\r\nin a good measure calm) is easier: of which I shall speak in their\r\nproper place.\r\n\r\nAt present I shall treat of those, which distress every day. Wherefore\r\nit is most convenient to give food to the patient every third day;\r\nthat the abstinence of one day may lessen the fever, on the other\r\nnourishment may recruit the strength. But when the fever is quotidian,\r\nand goes entirely off, it ought to be given as soon as the body becomes\r\nwell. But if though there are not distinct fits immediately succeeding\r\neach other, yet there are feverish heats without intermission, and\r\nthese daily increase without going entirely off, then _it is to be\r\nallowed at that point of time_, when a greater remission is not to be\r\nexpected: if on one day the fit is more severe, and on another milder,\r\nafter the most severe. Now commonly a more severe fit is followed by\r\nan easier night: whence it happens also, that a more troublesome night\r\nprecedes a severer fit.\r\n\r\nBut if the fever is continued, and is never mitigated, and there is\r\na necessity for giving food, the proper time for doing this is much\r\ndisputed. Some, because patients are commonly easier in the morning,\r\nthink that the opportunity. Which if it be so, is a proper time,\r\nnot because it is the morning, but because the patients then have a\r\nremission. If even at that time the patient has no ease, since upon\r\nthis very account that time is worse, that whereas from its own nature\r\nit ought to be better, from the force of the distemper it is not so;\r\nand likewise because the middle of the day follows, after which as\r\nalmost every patient grows worse, there is room to fear, lest he be\r\nthen more distressed, than he used to be: therefore, some give food\r\nto such a patient in the evening. But since at that time sick people\r\nare commonly worst, there is cause to be afraid, lest if we raise any\r\ncommotion then, the disorder may be increased. For these reasons others\r\ndefer it(4) till midnight, when the severest is just over, and while\r\nthe same is at the greatest distance. It is more safely given before\r\nday-light, when most sick people get the quietest sleep; next to that\r\nin the morning, the time which is naturally the easiest of all.\r\n\r\nBut if the fits are irregular, because in such a case there is room\r\nto fear, that they may follow immediately after food; whenever a\r\npatient is relieved from the paroxysms he ought to eat. But if several\r\nparoxysms come on the same day, it is necessary to consider, whether\r\nthese be in all respects equal (which can scarcely happen) or unequal.\r\nIf they be in every point equal, food ought rather to be given after\r\nthat fit, the end of which does not fall betwixt mid-day and the\r\nevening. If they are unequal, it must be considered what the difference\r\nis. For if one is more severe, and the other more mild, it ought to be\r\ngiven after the more severe fit: if the one is longer, and the other\r\nshorter, after the longer: if one is more severe, and the other of\r\nlonger continuance, it must be examined, which of the two distresses\r\nmost, the one by its violence, or the other by its continuance; and\r\nit must be given after the most weakening. But it is plainly the most\r\nimportant point of all, how great the remissions are, and of what\r\nnature, which happen between the fits. For if an uneasiness remains\r\nafter one paroxysm, and the body feels no indisposition after the\r\nother; when the body is well, it is the fitter time for food.\r\n\r\nIf a feverishness always continues, but yet one remission is longer\r\nthan the other, that is rather to be chosen: so that when the fits are\r\ncontinued, food may be administered immediately upon the decline of the\r\nfirst. For this is an universal rule, and may serve for directing all\r\nour measures in this article, to give food at the greatest distance\r\nalways from a future fit; and with this caution to give it in the best\r\nstate of the body. Which must be observed not only between two fits,\r\nbut also amongst several. But whereas it is most generally proper to\r\ngive food every third day, yet if the body is weak it must be given\r\nevery day: and much more so, if the fevers are continued without any\r\nremission: and it is the more needful, the more they weaken the body;\r\nor if two or more fits attack on the same day. Which occurrence also\r\nrequires the giving of food every day immediately from the first, if\r\nthe pulse has presently sunk; and oftener on the same day, if in the\r\nmidst of several fits the strength of the body now and then fails.\r\nYet in these this observation must be regarded; that after such fits\r\nless food be given, where if the strength of the body would admit,\r\nnone would be given at all. Now as a paroxysm must either be instantly\r\nexpected, or beginning, or increasing, or at its height, or abating;\r\nand again in its abatement either at a stand, or entirely gone off;\r\nit is certain the best season for food is, when the fever is ended;\r\nnext to that, when in its abatement it stops; thirdly, if there be a\r\nnecessity, whenever it begins to abate: all other times are dangerous.\r\nBut if upon account of weakness there is an absolute necessity for it,\r\nit is better to give somewhat, when its increase is at a stand, than\r\nwhile it still increases; better when it is instantly expected, than\r\nwhen it is beginning. Nevertheless no time is improper for supporting\r\none, who faints for want.\r\n\r\nNor indeed is it sufficient for a physician to regard only the fevers,\r\nbut also the state of the whole body, and direct his cure by that;\r\nwhether the patient has a sufficient measure of strength or not,\r\nwhether some troublesome passions affect the mind. And as the sick\r\nshould always be in a state of tranquillity, that they be distressed in\r\nbody only, and not in mind at the same time; so it is more especially\r\nnecessary immediately after food; so that if there be any thing, which\r\nwould render them uneasy, it is the best way, while they are sick, to\r\nconceal it from them; if that cannot be done, at least to forbear after\r\nfood; and after their time of sleep, and when they have awaked, then to\r\ncommunicate it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. VI.\r\n\r\nTHE PROPER TIMES FOR GIVING DRINK TO PERSONS IN FEVERS, AND THE KINDS\r\nOF ALIMENT SUITED TO THE SEVERAL STAGES OF THE DISTEMPER, TOGETHER WITH\r\nSOME GENERAL OBSERVATIONS.\r\n\r\n\r\nBut patients are more easily managed with regard to food; because\r\nin spite of some inclination of their own, the stomach then refuses\r\nit. But in the article of drink the struggle is hard; and the more\r\nviolent, the higher the fever is: for this inflames the thirst, and\r\ndemands water most importunately, when it is most dangerous. But the\r\npatient is to be informed, that when the fever has abated, the thirst\r\nalso will immediately decline; and that the paroxysm will be longer,\r\nif any nourishment be given to him: and that he that drinks none, is\r\nsooner freed from the thirst. However as even people in health can\r\nbear hunger a good deal easier than thirst, it is necessary to indulge\r\nthe sick more with regard to drink than food. But on the first day no\r\nmoisture ought to be given, unless the pulse has suddenly sunk so low,\r\nthat there is a necessity for giving food also; but on the second and\r\nfollowing days likewise, where food is not to be allowed, yet if the\r\nthirst be violent, drink may be given.\r\n\r\nWhat was said by Heraclides of Tarentum is not altogether without\r\nreason; that when either bile or crudity make a patient uneasy; it is\r\nexpedient by a moderate quantity of a drink to mix new matter with the\r\ncorrupted. This rule ought carefully to be observed, that the same\r\ntimes be chosen for drink as for food: when it is to be given without\r\nthe other, let it be at a time, when we would desire the patient\r\nto sleep, which commonly thirst prevents. It is generally allowed,\r\nthat as too much moisture is hurtful to every person in a fever, it\r\nis especially so to such women, as have fallen into fevers after\r\nchild-bearing.\r\n\r\nBut as the fever and the manner of its remission direct to the proper\r\nseasons for food and drink, so it is not very easy to know, when the\r\npatient has a fever upon him, when he is better, or when his strength\r\nfails; without which these cannot be properly administered. For we\r\nprincipally trust the pulse, a most fallacious mark; because this is\r\noften slower or more quick from the age, and sex, and difference of\r\nconstitutions. And generally when the body is in good enough health,\r\nif the stomach be weak, sometimes also in the beginning of a fever,\r\nit rises and sinks; so that the person may seem to be weak, when he\r\ncan very well stand a severe fit that is just approaching. On the\r\nother hand, the pulse is often raised, and the vessels relaxed by the\r\ninfluence of the sun, and the bath, and exercise, and fear, and anger,\r\nand any other passion of the mind. So that, when a physician first\r\ncomes in, the anxiety of the patient, doubtful how he may think him,\r\naccelerates the pulse. For this reason it is the business of a skilful\r\nphysician not to take hold of the patient’s arm with his hand, as soon\r\nas he comes in; but first to sit down with a cheerful countenance, and\r\nask him how he does; and if he has any apprehension, to encourage him\r\nwith plausible discourse: then to apply his hand to his wrist(5).\r\nNow if the sight of the physician quickens the pulse, how easily may a\r\nthousand other accidents disorder it! Another mark, to which we trust,\r\nis heat, equally deceitful; for this is excited by warmth, labour,\r\nsleep, fear, and anxiety.\r\n\r\nWherefore it is fit to consider those things; but not to trust\r\nentirely to them. And we may at once assure ourselves that a\r\nperson has no fever, whose pulse moves regularly, and who has such\r\na heat as is common to people in health; and that a fever is not\r\nnecessarily breeding, when there is heat and motion; but only with\r\nthese circumstances, if the surface of the skin, be unequally dry; if\r\nthere be a heat in the forehead, and at the same time arising from\r\nthe internal part of the præcordia; if the breath rushes out of the\r\nnostrils very hot; if the colour be changed either for a redness or\r\nan unusual paleness; if the eyes are heavy, and either very dry or\r\nsomewhat moist; if when a sweat comes on, it is partial; if the pulse\r\ndoes not beat at equal intervals. Upon this account the physician ought\r\nto sit down neither in the dark, nor at the patient’s head, but in a\r\nlight place opposite to him, that he may take all the marks from the\r\ncountenance of the patient as he lies.\r\n\r\nNow where there has been a fever, and it has decreased, it is, proper\r\nto take notice, whether the temples or other parts of the body grow a\r\nlittle moist, so as to portend an approaching sweat. And if there is\r\nany prognostic of it, upon that to give warm water to drink, the effect\r\nof which is salutary, if it diffuse a sweat over the whole body. For\r\nthis purpose the patient ought to keep his hands under a good quantity\r\nof clothes; and to cover his legs and feet in the same manner. By\r\nlaying on such a load many people mismanage patients in the very height\r\nof the fever, and especially where it is of the ardent kind. If the\r\nbody begins to sweat, it is necessary to warm a linen cloth, and slowly\r\nto wipe every part. But when the sweat is entirely off, or if it have\r\nnot come on, when the patient is warmest, and seems fit for food, he\r\nis to be gently anointed under the clothes, then wiped, and after that\r\nfood is to be given him.\r\n\r\nLiquid food is most proper for persons in fevers, at least as near\r\nas possible to liquids, and that of the lightest kind, particularly\r\ngruel; and even this, if the fever be violent, ought to be very thin.\r\nClarified honey also is properly added to it, that the body may be more\r\nnourished: but if that offends the stomach, it should be omitted; and\r\nso should the gruel itself in like case. Instead of it may be given\r\neither intrita,(6) mixed with hot water, or washed alica; if the\r\nstomach is firm, and the belly bound, with hydromel; or if the first\r\nis weak, and the other loose, with vinegar and water. And this kind of\r\nfood is sufficient for the first day: but on the second day something\r\nmay be added, yet of the same nature, either greens, or conchylia,\r\nor apples. And while fevers are increasing, this is the only proper\r\nfood. But when they either go off, or abate, we must always begin with\r\nsomething of the lightest nature, and make an addition of the middle\r\nkind, having in the mean time a regard both to the strength of the\r\npatient, and of the disease.\r\n\r\nTo set a variety of food before a patient (as Asclepiades directs) is\r\nnever proper, but when he is oppressed with a nausea, and his strength\r\nfails; that by tasting a little of each he may escape being famished.\r\nBut if the patient wants neither strength nor appetite, he must be\r\ntempted by no variety; lest he take more than he is able to concoct.\r\nNeither is that true, which he alleges, that food of various kinds\r\nis more easily concocted; it is indeed taken in more easily; but to\r\nconcoction the genus and quantity of the food are material. Neither\r\nis it safe during great pains, nor in an encreasing distemper, for a\r\npatient to fill himself with food; but when there is already a turn\r\ntowards recovery.\r\n\r\nThere are also other observations necessary to be made in fevers: and\r\nthat indeed must be considered, which some regard solely, whether the\r\nbody be bound or loose: the one of which suffocates, and the other\r\ndissipates. For if it is bound, the belly must be opened by clysters,\r\nurine promoted, and a sweat sollicited by every method. In this kind of\r\ndisorder it is serviceable even to let blood, to agitate the body by\r\nstrong gestations, to keep the person in the light, to enjoin fasting,\r\nthirst, and watchfulness. It does good also to take the person into the\r\nbath, first to plunge him into the warm bath, then anoint him. Then he\r\nshould return to the warm bath, and foment his groin plentifully with\r\nwater; sometimes mix oil in the bath with warm water; take food more\r\nseldom, and at greater distances than ordinary, and such as is slight,\r\nsimple, soft, warm, and small in quantity; especially greens, such as\r\ndock, nettles, mallows, or the broth of shell-fish, or muscles, or\r\nlocustae; and eat no flesh, but what is boiled. But the quantity of\r\ndrink ought to be more liberal, both before meat, and after it, and\r\nwhile eating too, beyond what thirst will require. And after the bath\r\nmay be given even fat broth, or wine of the sweeter kind: during which\r\ncourse once or twice salt Greek wine may be used.\r\n\r\nBut on the contrary, if the body incline to discharge excessively, then\r\nsweat must be restrained, and rest enjoined; and the patient may have\r\nhis room darkened, and go to sleep, whenever he shall chuse it; the\r\nbody is not to be agitated, unless by a gentle gestation, and to be\r\nrelieved according to the nature of its disorder. For if the belly is\r\nloose, or the stomach does not retain, when the fever has abated, it\r\nis proper to give warm water to drink plentifully, and make him vomit;\r\nunless there is a pain either in the fauces, or praecordia, or side, or\r\nthe distemper be inveterate.\r\n\r\nIf again a sweat prevails, the skin must be hardened, either by nitre\r\nor salt, mixed with oil. But if that disorder is more slight, the body\r\nmust be anointed with pure oil: if more violent, with oil of roses, or\r\nof quinces, or of myrtles, with an addition of austere wine.\r\n\r\nWhoever is disordered by any discharge, upon coming to the bath, must\r\nfirst be anointed, and then go in. If the disorder is in the skin, it\r\nwill be better for him to use cold water than warm. As to his meals,\r\nhis food should be substantial, cold, dry, simple, and the least liable\r\nto corruption, toasted bread, roasted flesh, austere wine, or at least\r\ninclining to austerity; and if the belly is loose, let him drink it\r\nhot; if sweating be the disorder, or vomiting, it must be cold.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. VII.\r\n\r\nOF THE CURE OF PESTILENTIAL AND ARDENT FEVERS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe case of pestilential fevers demands attention and a peculiar\r\ntreatment. In this it is by no means good to try fasting, or medicines,\r\nor clysters. If the strength will admit, it is best to let blood;\r\nespecially if the fever be attended with a burning heat. If that is not\r\nsafe, when the fever is either abated, or less violent, to cleanse the\r\nbreast by a vomit. But there is a necessity to order the bath sooner in\r\nthis than in other distempers; to give wine strong and hot, and every\r\nthing glutinous; amongst which flesh of the same kind. For the more\r\nquickly that such constitutions of the air destroy, so much the sooner\r\nmust remedies be laid hold of, even with a degree of rashness. But if\r\nhe be a boy, that labours under it, and have not sufficient strength\r\nfor bleeding, he must be cupped, and have a clyster either of water,\r\nor the cream of ptisan; then lastly he is to be nourished by light\r\nfood. It is a general rule, that boys ought to be treated altogether\r\nin a different method from men. Wherefore in this, as well as in every\r\nother kind of distemper, greater caution must be used at that age in\r\nthe following articles: not to bleed, not to give a clyster without\r\nnecessity, nor to torment by watching, or fasting, or excessive thirst,\r\nnor to attempt the cure by wine. The patient must vomit after the\r\nfever: then the lightest kind of food is to be given; after that he is\r\nto sleep: the day following, if the fever continue, he must fast; on\r\nthe third day return to the same diet. And we must endeavour, as much\r\nas possible in the midst of a seasonable abstinence to nourish him by\r\nfood at proper times, laying aside every thing else.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Of an Ardent fever._]\r\n\r\nIf an ardent fever is very violent, no medicinal potion is to be given;\r\nbut during the paroxysms the patient must be cooled by water and oil:\r\nwhich are to be agitated together, till they grow white. He is also to\r\nbe kept in a spacious room, where he can draw a great deal of pure air;\r\nand not be suffocated by many cloaths, but be covered very lightly.\r\nVine leaves also dipped in cold water may be put upon his stomach. And\r\nhe is not to be tormented with excessive thirst. He is to be allowed\r\nnourishment sooner; that is after the third day: and before meat he\r\nmust be anointed all over with the above-mentioned liquor. If there is\r\na collection of phlegm in his stomach, upon the decline of the paroxysm\r\nhe must be forced to vomit; and then he must eat cold greens, or fruit\r\nof the apple kind, such as agrees with the stomach. If the stomach\r\nremains dry, there must be immediately given the cream either of\r\nptisan, or alica, or rice, boiled with recent fat. When the distemper\r\nis at the height, but not before the fourth day, after a great thirst\r\npreceding, cold water is to be given copiously, that he may drink even\r\nbeyond satiety; and when the belly and praecordia are filled above\r\nmeasure, and sufficiently cooled, he ought to vomit. Some indeed do not\r\ninsist upon vomiting; but make use of cold water as a medicine, given\r\nonly to satiety. After either of these methods he is to be well covered\r\nwith cloaths, and laid so as to go to sleep. And commonly after long\r\nthirst and wakefulness, after being satiated with full draughts, after\r\na remission of the heat, a sound and long sleep comes on; by means of\r\nwhich a great sweat breaks out, and that is a most immediate relief;\r\nbut only in those, who have the burning heat, but no pains, nor tumour\r\nof the praecordia, and nothing to prevent it in the lungs, or fauces;\r\nor have had no ulcer, nor faintings, nor looseness of the belly. But\r\nif one in such a fever as this coughs gently(7), he ought neither\r\nto struggle with a violent thirst, nor drink cold water; but to be\r\ntreated in the same manner, as is directed in other fevers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. VIII.\r\n\r\nTHE CURE OF A SEMITERTIAN.\r\n\r\n\r\nBut where there is that kind of tertian, which the physicians call\r\nsemitertian, it requires careful observation to prevent being deceived.\r\nFor it has generally more frequent paroxysms and intervals, so as it\r\nmay seem a different kind of distemper; and the fit is protracted to\r\ntwenty-four hours(8) and thirty-six: that what is really the same,\r\ndoes not seem to be so. And it is highly necessary both that food\r\nshould not be given, unless in that remission, which is certain: and\r\nas soon as that comes, to give it immediately. And many patients die\r\nsuddenly by the mistake of their doctor either way. And unless there\r\nis some important reason against it, blood ought to be let in the\r\nbeginning; and then food should be given, such as will not raise the\r\nfever, and yet support under its long continuance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. IX.\r\n\r\nTHE CURE OF SLOW FEVERS.\r\n\r\n\r\nSometimes too we find slow fevers continuing without remission, and no\r\nroom left either for food or any remedy. In this case it ought to be\r\nthe care of the physician to change the distemper: for perhaps it may\r\nbecome more easy to cure. For this reason the body of the patient is\r\noften to be gently rubbed with cold water with oil infused, because\r\nsometimes it thus happens, that a shuddering arises, which may be some\r\nbeginning of a new commotion; after that, when the body has grown\r\nhotter, a remission may follow too. In these cases friction with oil\r\nand salt seems to be a useful method.\r\n\r\nBut if coldness of the extremities, and numbness, and restless changes\r\nof postures continue long, it is not amiss, even during the fever,\r\nto give three or four cyathi of mulse, or well diluted wine together\r\nwith food. For the fever is often encreased by it; and a greater heat\r\narising at the same time both removes the former disorders, and affords\r\nhope of a remission, and from that of a cure.\r\n\r\nAnd indeed the method of cure is not new, to make use of contrary\r\nmedicines, by which at this time some recover patients committed to\r\ntheir charge, who were long under the care of more cautious physicians.\r\nFor even amongst the ancients before Herophilus and Erasistratus, but\r\nafter Hippocrates, was one Petron, who, as soon as he was called to a\r\nperson in a fever, laid a great many cloaths upon him, that he might\r\nat once excite a great heat and thirst. After that, when the fever\r\nbegan to be a little abated, he gave cold water to drink; and if it\r\nonce raised a sweat, he pronounced the patient to be out of danger: if\r\nit had not procured that discharge, he gave still more cold water, and\r\nthen obliged him to vomit. If by either method he freed the person from\r\nthe fever, he immediately gave him roast pork and wine. If it did not\r\ngive way to these methods, he boiled water with salt, and obliged him\r\nto drink it, that by vomiting he might cleanse his belly(9).\r\n\r\nAnd these particulars made up his whole practice. Which was not\r\nless acceptable to those, whom the successors of Hippocrates had\r\nnot recovered, than it is to those in this age, who have been long\r\nunsuccessfully treated by the followers of Herophilus or Erasistratus.\r\nNor is this kind of medicine upon this account not to be esteemed rash;\r\nbecause if it has been pursued from the beginning, it kills more,\r\n_than it cures_. But since the same things cannot agree with every\r\nbody, those commonly, who are not restored by a rational method, are\r\nrelieved by temerity; and for that reason physicians of that class\r\nmanage another’s patients better than their own. But it is a practice\r\nnot unbecoming even the man of circumspection, at times both to change\r\na distemper, and to increase one, and to inflame fevers; because where\r\nthe disorder, that is present, does not admit of a cure, another may,\r\nwhich is to succeed in its place.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. X.\r\n\r\nREMEDIES FOR THE CONCOMITANT SYMPTOMS OF FEVERS.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is necessary also to consider, whether fevers are simple, or whether\r\nother disorders are not likewise concomitant; that is, whether the\r\nhead be pained, the tongue rough, or the præcordia tense. If there be\r\npains in the head, it is proper to mix oil of roses with vinegar, and\r\nto apply that(10); then to have two pieces of cloth, which are as\r\nbroad and as long as the forehead; to have one of these alternately\r\nin the vinegar and rose-oil, and the other on the forehead; or to put\r\non sordid wool dipped in the same. If vinegar is offensive, pure oil\r\nof roses must be used. If even the rose-oil is offensive, bitter oil.\r\nIf these do little service, dry iris, or bitter almonds, or any of\r\nthe cooling herbs may be powdered. Any of them mixed with vinegar and\r\nlaid upon the part lessens the pain: but in some one of these is more\r\nsuccessful, and in others another. Relief is also procured by bread\r\nlaid on with poppies, or with oil of roses, cerus, or litharge. It is\r\nalso not improper to smell at either serpyllum or dill.\r\n\r\nBut if there is an inflammation and pain in the præcordia, in the first\r\nplace restringent cataplasms must be applied; and not the hotter kind,\r\nlest there should be a greater flux of matter thither. After that, as\r\nsoon as the inflammation has abated, recourse must be had to hot and\r\nmoist, in order to discuss what remains. Now the marks of inflammation\r\nare four, redness, and swelling, together with heat, and pain. So much\r\nwas Erasistratus mistaken, when he declared there was no fever without\r\nit.\r\n\r\nWherefore if there is pain without inflammation, nothing is to be\r\napplied at all; for the fever itself will presently remove that. But\r\nif there is neither an inflammation, nor fever, but only a pain of the\r\npræcordia, warm and dry fomentations may be immediately used. If the\r\ntongue is dry and scabrous, it is first to be wiped with a penecillum\r\ndipped in hot water; and then anointed with a mixture of rose-oil and\r\nhoney. The honey cleanses, and the oil of roses restringes, and at the\r\nsame time does not suffer it to grow dry. But if it is not rough, but\r\nonly dry, after wiping it with the penecillum it ought to be anointed\r\nwith rose-oil mixed with a little wax.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. XI.\r\n\r\nREMEDIES AGAINST A COLDNESS OF THE EXTREMITIES PRECEDING A FEVER.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is common also for a coldness to precede fevers, which of itself\r\nis a very troublesome kind of disorder. When it is expected, the\r\npatient must be forbid all drink: for giving this a little before\r\nmuch increases the malady. He is also to be timely covered with many\r\ncloaths. Dry and hot fomentations are to be used to those parts, for\r\nwhich we are apprehensive; in such a manner that the most violent heat\r\nmay not begin immediately, but increase gradually. And those parts are\r\nto be rubbed with the hands anointed with old oil, and some of the\r\nwarming medicines may be added to it. And some physicians are content\r\nwith one friction with any kind of oil. In the remissions of such\r\nfevers some give three or four cyathi of gruel, while the fever still\r\ncontinues; and then, when it is quite over, refresh the stomach with\r\ncold and light food. I think this ought to be then tried, when food\r\nonce given, and that after the fever, does little service.\r\n\r\nBut great care must be taken, that we be not deceived as to the\r\ntime of the remission; for even in this kind of distemper, often\r\nthe fever seems to abate, and again increases. Wherefore we must\r\ntrust no remission, but that, which both continues, and lessens\r\nthe restlessness, and excessive heat of the body, which the Greeks\r\ncall(11) zesis[BD]. This is a rule generally received, if every day\r\nthe fits are equal, to give a little food every day: if unequal, food\r\nmust be given after the most severe; after the milder hydromel.\r\n\r\n  [BD] ζίσις.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. XII.\r\n\r\nTHE CURE OF A SHUDDERING BEFORE FEVERS.\r\n\r\n\r\nA shuddering commonly precedes those fevers, that have a certain\r\nperiod, and a perfect remission, and for this reason are the most safe,\r\nand most easily admit of a cure: for where the periods are uncertain,\r\nneither clysters, nor the bath, nor wine, nor any other remedy can be\r\nduly administered. For it is uncertain when the fit will come: so that\r\nif it come on suddenly, the greatest detriment may happen to accrue\r\nfrom that, which was intended to give relief. And nothing else can be\r\ndone, than that the patient practise a strict abstinence in the first\r\ndays of the disease: then upon the decline of that fit, which is most\r\nsevere, let him take food.\r\n\r\nBut where the period is certain, all these things are more easily\r\ntried; because we can more readily inform ourselves of the succession\r\nboth of the fits and the intervals. Now in this kind, when they are of\r\nlong standing, fasting is not good: in the first days only we are to\r\nmake use of it to oppose the distemper; after that the cure is to be\r\ndivided, and first the shuddering, then the fever is to be removed.\r\nWherefore as soon as a person has shuddered, and after the shuddering\r\nhas grown hot, it is fit to give him warm water to drink a little salt,\r\nand force him to vomit: for generally such a shuddering arises from\r\nsomething bilious oppressing the stomach. The same method is to be\r\npursued, if at the next period also it has again appeared: for thus it\r\nis often removed. And by this time one may find out the species of the\r\nfever.\r\n\r\nWherefore when the third fit is expected, which may possibly come on,\r\nthe patient must be brought to the bagnio, and care must be taken\r\nthat he be in the bath at the time of shuddering. If he have felt it\r\nthere also, let him do the same nevertheless, when the fourth fit is\r\nexpected: for by this repetition it is often removed. If the bath\r\nproves unsuccessful, before the fit let him eat garlick, or drink\r\nhot water with pepper: for these too raise a heat, which repels the\r\nshuddering. After that, before the shuddering has time to come on, let\r\nhim cover himself up in the manner above directed under the article\r\nof coldness: and it is proper immediately to apply all round his body\r\npretty hot fomentations, and chiefly extinguished tiles, and coals\r\nwrapped up in cloths.\r\n\r\nIf notwithstanding the shuddering has broke out, he must be anointed\r\nwithin the cloaths plentifully with hot oil; to which also may be added\r\nsome of the warming substances: and friction may be used, to as great\r\na degree as he is able to bear, and especially in his hands and feet,\r\nand let him hold in his breath. And it must not be given over, although\r\nthe shuddering do return: for often the perseverance of the physician\r\novercomes the distemper of the body.\r\n\r\nIf he has vomited, warm water must be given, and he obliged to vomit\r\nagain; and the same methods must be repeated, till the shuddering is\r\nremoved. But beside these a clyster must be given, if the shuddering\r\ngives way slowly: for that has a good effect by exonerating the\r\nbody. The last remedies after these are gestation and walking. Now\r\nin distempers of this kind, the fittest food is such as may prove\r\nlaxative, and glutinous flesh. When wine is given, let it be austere.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. XIII.\r\n\r\nTHE CURE OF A QUOTIDIAN FEVER,\r\n\r\n\r\nNow these observations relate to the periodical returns of all fevers:\r\nbut the several species of them are to be distinctly treated, according\r\nto their different natures. If it be a quotidian, for the first three\r\ndays by all means abstinence should be observed; then food be taken\r\nevery other day. If the distemper has become inveterate, after the\r\nfit it is proper to try the bath and wine, especially if, when the\r\nshuddering is removed, the fever remains.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. XIV.\r\n\r\nTHE CURE OF A TERTIAN FEVER.\r\n\r\n\r\nBut if the fever be either a tertian, which has a perfect intermission,\r\nor a quartan, on the intermediate days, it is proper to walk, and make\r\nuse of other exercises and unctions. Cleophantus, one of the more\r\nancient physicians, in these distempers used to pour a great quantity\r\nof hot water upon the head of the patient long before the fit, and\r\nthen to give him wine. Yet Asclepiades, though he adopted most of his\r\nprecepts, has justly omitted this: for it is of doubtful effect.\r\n\r\nWhen there is a tertian fever, he says it is proper to administer a\r\nclyster the third day after the fit; on the fifth, after the shuddering\r\nto procure a vomiting; then after the fever, according to Cleophantus’s\r\npractice, to give the patients food and wine, while they are yet hot;\r\non the sixth day to keep them in bed: for thus it will happen, that\r\nthe fit will not return on the seventh day. That this may often answer\r\nis very probable. Yet it is safer in this order to make trial of these\r\nthree remedies, vomiting, purging by clysters, and drinking of wine,\r\nfor three days, that is, on the third, and fifth, and seventh; and not\r\nto drink wine, till after the fit upon the seventh day.\r\n\r\nBut if the distemper is not removed in these first days, and it grows\r\ninveterate, on the day the fit is expected, let the patient keep his\r\nbed; after the fit be rubbed; and after eating let him drink water: the\r\nday following, when he takes no food, let him intermit his exercise and\r\nunction, and rest content with water alone. And this indeed is best.\r\nBut if his weakness bear hard upon him, he ought both to take wine\r\nafter the fit, and a little food on the intermediate day.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. XV.\r\n\r\nTHE CURE OF A QUARTAN FEVER.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe same method is to be followed in a quartan. But since this is\r\nvery slowly terminated, unless it have been removed in the beginning,\r\ngreater accuracy must be observed in prescribing from its first\r\nappearance, what ought to be done it. Wherefore if a person is attacked\r\nwith a fever and shuddering, and it has gone off, all that day and the\r\nfollowing, and the third, he ought to confine himself to a stricter\r\nregimen, and on the first day drink only warm water after the fever;\r\nthe two following days to abstain from that as much as possible; on the\r\nfourth day, if the fever returns with the shuddering, to vomit, as has\r\nbeen directed before; then after the fit, to eat sparingly, and drink a\r\nquadrans of wine; the day after that, and the third to abstain; taking\r\nonly warm water if he be thirsty. On the seventh day he should prevent\r\nthe coldness, by going into the bath before its time, fast and observe\r\nthe former regimen strictly(12); if the fever has returned, have a\r\nclyster: when the body has rested after that, he should be anointed and\r\nbrushed briskly; take food and wine in the same way, and for the two\r\nfollowing fast, not neglecting the friction. On the tenth day he must\r\ntry the bath again; and if the fit has come on after, brush in the same\r\nmanner, and drink wine more plentifully. And thus the consequence is,\r\nthat a rest of so many days, and abstinence, with the practice of the\r\nother injunctions, may remove the fever.\r\n\r\nIf notwithstanding these it continues, another method of cure entirely\r\ndifferent is to be pursued; and all our measures must be directed to\r\nthis point, that the body may easily bear what is to be long endured.\r\nFor this reason the practice of Heraclides of Tarentum ought to be\r\nless approved, who prescribed clysters in the beginning, after that\r\nfasting to the seventh day. Which course though a person should be able\r\nto undergo, yet when he is even freed of the fever, he will scarcely\r\nhave strength to recruit; and so if the fever frequently returns, he\r\nmust sink under it. Wherefore if the distemper shall continue upon the\r\nthirteenth day, the bath must neither be tried before the fever nor\r\nafter it, unless sometimes when the shuddering is already removed.\r\nNow the shuddering is to be repelled by the same means, as have been\r\ndirected before. Then after the fever it is proper to be anointed,\r\nand rubbed briskly; to eat heartily of substantial food; to take\r\nas much wine as he inclines; the day following, when he has rested\r\nsufficiently, to walk, take exercise, be anointed, and stoutly brushed;\r\nto take food without wine; on the third day to abstain.\r\n\r\nOn the day that he shall expect the return of the fever, it is proper\r\nfor him to rise before _its hour_, and exercise himself, and to\r\nendeavour to have its time coinciding with his exercise: for thus it is\r\noften dispelled. But if it has seized him in the midst of his exercise,\r\nin that case to give over. In a disorder of this kind the remedies are\r\nunction, friction, exercise, food and wine. If the belly is bound, it\r\nmust be opened.\r\n\r\nNow these things are easily performed by the more robust; but if the\r\npatient be grown weak, gestation must stand instead of exercise. If he\r\ncannot even bear this, yet friction must be used. If this also when\r\nvehement distresses him, the cure must be confined to rest, unction,\r\nand diet: and care must be taken, lest any crudity change the distemper\r\ninto a quotidian. For a quartan kills no body: but if it be changed\r\ninto a quotidian, the patient is in a bad way: which however never\r\nhappens, unless by the fault either of the patient or the physician.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. XVI.\r\n\r\nTHE CURE OF A DOUBLE QUARTAN.\r\n\r\n\r\nBut if there are two quartans, and those exercises, which I have\r\nprescribed cannot be used, there is a necessity either entirely to\r\nrest, or if that is difficult, to walk gently, then sit down, with the\r\nfeet and head carefully wrapped up; as often as the fit has come on,\r\nand gone off, to eat sparingly, and drink a little wine; at other\r\ntimes, unless the weakness be very great, to abstain. But if there is\r\nhardly any intermission between two fits, to take food after both are\r\nover: then in the interval both to move a little, and after unction to\r\neat. Now since an inveterate quartan is very seldom cured unless in the\r\nspring, in that season especially attention must be given, that nothing\r\nbe done, which may obstruct the recovery of health. And it is of\r\nservice in an old quartan to alter now and then the manner of living,\r\nto change from wine to water, from water to wine, from mild food to\r\nsuch as is acrid, and on the contrary; to eat radish, then vomit, or\r\nopen the belly by chicken broth; to add warming medicines to the oil\r\nfor friction; before the fit to take two cyathi of vinegar, or one of\r\nmustard, with three of Greek salt wine; or pepper, castor, laser(13),\r\nand myrrh, mixed in equal proportions, and diluted with water; for by\r\nthese, and such like the body must be agitated, that so a change may be\r\nmade from its present state.\r\n\r\nIf the fever has disappeared, it is proper to be long mindful of its\r\nperiodical day; and on that day to guard against cold, heat, crudity,\r\nand fatigue: for it easily returns, unless it be feared for some time\r\nafter the recovery of health.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. XVII.\r\n\r\nTHE CURE OF A QUOTIDIAN ARISING FROM A QUARTAN.\r\n\r\n\r\nBut if a quotidian is formed from a quartan, when that has happened\r\nin the beginning(14), it is proper to abstain for two days; in the\r\nevening to make use of friction, and give only water to drink. On the\r\nthird day it often happens, that the fit does not come. But whether it\r\nhas appeared or not, food must be given after the time for the fit: and\r\nif it continue, the strictest abstinence possible must be enjoined for\r\ntwo days, and friction used every day.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. XVIII.\r\n\r\nOF THE SEVERAL KINDS OF MADNESS AND THEIR CURE.\r\n\r\n\r\nI have now gone through the treatment of fevers. There remain other\r\ndisorders of the body, which come on after them: some of which, that\r\ncannot be assigned(15) to any certain part, I shall immediately\r\nsubjoin. I shall begin with madness, and treat of the first kind of\r\nit, which is both acute, and happens in a fever; the Greeks call it\r\nphrenitis[BE].\r\n\r\n  [BE] φρεν̃ιτις.\r\n\r\nFirst of all it is necessary to know, that sick people sometimes in a\r\nfebrile paroxysm lose their judgment, and talk incoherently. Which,\r\nthough it be not trifling, and cannot happen unless in a violent fever,\r\nyet is not equally dangerous; for it is commonly of short continuance:\r\nand when the violence of the fit is abated, the judgment presently\r\nreturns. Nor does this kind of distemper require any other remedy, than\r\nwhat has been already directed for curing a fever.\r\n\r\nIt becomes then a phrenitis, when the delirium begins to continue\r\nwithout interruption; or when the patient, though he still have his\r\nreason, yet forms to himself some vain images: it is perfect, when the\r\nmind gives itself up to these images. Now there are several kinds of\r\nit: for amongst phrenitic people some are merry, others sad; some are\r\nmore easily commanded, and their disorder goes no farther than words;\r\nothers grow outrageous, and do acts of violence; and of these last\r\nagain some only employ force, others even make use of cunning, and\r\npresent a specious appearance of judgment, while they are catching at\r\nopportunities of doing mischief; but they are discovered by the issue.\r\n\r\nSuch of them as only rattle, or do no harm but in trifles, it is\r\nneedless to load with severe restraints. Those, who are more violent\r\nin their actions, it is proper to bind, lest they should hurt either\r\nthemselves or any other person. Nor should we trust any of them, if in\r\norder to get rid of his chains he pretends to be well, though he speak\r\nsensibly, and make lamentable complaints; because this is nothing else\r\nbut the cunning of a mad person.\r\n\r\nGenerally the ancients kept such patients in the dark; for this reason,\r\nthat it hurts them to be terrified: and they judged, that darkness of\r\nitself contributed something to the quiet of the mind. But Asclepiades,\r\nalleging that darkness itself strikes terror, ordered them to be kept\r\nin the light. But neither of these holds always. For one person is\r\nmore disturbed by the light, and another by darkness: and some are to\r\nbe met with, in whom no difference can be found either the one way or\r\nthe other. Therefore it is best to try both methods; and to keep him,\r\nthat has a horror at darkness, in the light; and him, that is afraid\r\nof light, in darkness. But where there is no such difference, if the\r\npatient have strength, he must be confined in a light place; if not, in\r\na dark one.\r\n\r\nTo make use of remedies in the greatest violence of the phrenzy is\r\nneedless: for at the same time the fever also increases. Wherefore\r\nnothing is to be done then, besides confining the patient. But when\r\nthe circumstances allow, speedy help must be administered. Asclepiades\r\nasserted, that to bleed such was just the same as to murder them: upon\r\nthis principle, that there was no madness, but when the fever was very\r\nhigh; and that bleeding could not be properly performed, unless in\r\nits remission. He himself endeavoured to procure sleep in such cases\r\nby much friction. But since both the violence of the fever prevents\r\nsleep, and friction is not useful unless in its remission, he ought to\r\nhave omitted this remedy too. What then is to be said to this case?\r\nMany things are properly done in imminent danger, which should not be\r\npractised on any other occasion. And even a continued fever has times,\r\nin which, though it does not remit, nevertheless it does not increase.\r\nAnd this though not the best, yet is a pretty favourable season for the\r\napplication of remedies. And if the strength of the patient admits of\r\nit, he may also lose blood.\r\n\r\nThere may be the same reason(16) for doubting whether a clyster\r\nshould be administered. Then after the interval of a day, it is fit to\r\nclip the hair of the head close to the skin; then to foment it with\r\na decoction of some of the restringent herbs; or to foment it first,\r\nafter that clip, and foment it again; and lastly to embrocate the\r\nhead and nostrils with oil of roses; to hold also to the nostrils rue\r\nbruised with vinegar, and to provoke sneezing by medicines efficacious\r\nfor that purpose. These things however are to be done only to persons,\r\nwho don’t want strength. If there be a weakness, the head is only to\r\nbe moistened with oil of roses, adding to it serpyllum or something of\r\nthe like nature. Also whatever be the degree of strength, two herbs are\r\nuseful, nightshade and the wall-herb, if the head be bathed with the\r\nexpressed juice of them both. When the fever has remitted, friction\r\nmust be used; but more sparingly in those, that are too merry, than in\r\nthose, that are too sad.\r\n\r\nIt is necessary to apply to the minds of people thus mad in a manner\r\nsuitable to the temper of each. For the groundless apprehensions of\r\nsome are to be alleviated: as was done to a very rich man in fear\r\nof starving, whom they relieved by frequent accounts of estates\r\nbequeathed to him. The audaciousness of others must be restrained,\r\nas is practised in the case of those, who require even stripes to\r\nkeep them under government. The unseasonable laughter of some must\r\nbe checked by chiding and threats. The sorrowful thoughts of others\r\nmust be dispelled: for which purpose concerts of music, and cymbals\r\nand noise are useful. Yet these patients must be oftener humoured\r\nthan contradicted: and the mind is to be led by slow degrees, and\r\nnot evidently, from their irrational assertions to better notions.\r\nSometimes also the attention of the person must be strongly engaged;\r\na method taken with studious men, to whom a book is read, either with\r\npropriety of accent, if they be pleased with it, or with an improper\r\ntone of voice, if that offends them: for by correcting they begin to\r\ngive their attention. Moreover they must be obliged to repeat any thing\r\nthey may remember. Some also have brought those to eat, that had no\r\ninclination for it, by placing them in the midst of people at a feast.\r\n\r\nTo every body thus affected, sleep is both hard to be obtained,\r\nand highly necessary; for by this most of them recover. For this\r\npurpose, and at the same time for composing the mind, the ointment of\r\nsaffron(17) with that of iris rubbed upon the head is useful. If\r\nnotwithstanding they continue wakeful, some endeavour to procure them\r\nsleep by giving them to drink a decoction of poppies or henbane; others\r\nput mandrake apples under their pillow: others apply to their forehead\r\neither amomum or sycamine tear. This name I find among the physicians.\r\nBut why do the Greeks call the mulberry-tree sycaminus[BF], when there\r\nis no tear of the mulberry-tree? But this name they give to the tear of\r\na tree growing in Egypt, which they call sycomorum[BG]. Many physicians\r\nnow and then foment the face and head with a sponge dipt in a decoction\r\nof poppy-heads.\r\n\r\n  [BF] συκάμινος.\r\n\r\n  [BG] συκόμορον.\r\n\r\nAsclepiades affirmed these things to be hurtful: because they often\r\nchange the distemper into a lethargy. His advice is, that the first day\r\nthe patient should abstain from meat, drink, and sleep; on the evening\r\nwater should be given him to drink; then friction should be used so\r\ngentle, that even the hand that rubbed, should not press strongly; the\r\nday after, all these things being repeated, on the evening gruel and\r\nwater should be allowed him, and the friction again repeated: for by\r\nthis we would procure sleep. This sometimes happens; insomuch that by\r\nhis own confession, too much friction may even endanger a lethargy.\r\nBut if by these means sleep is not obtained, then at last it must\r\nbe procured by the medicines above-mentioned: still with the same\r\nmoderation, which is also necessary in this case; lest it be not in our\r\npower afterwards to wake the person, whom we desire to sleep. A fall of\r\nwater near is also some help to sleep; or gestation after meat, and in\r\nthe night time; especially the motion of a suspended bed.\r\n\r\nNor is it improper, if bleeding has not gone before, and the\r\nunderstanding be still disturbed, and there be no sleep, to make an\r\nincision in the occiput, and apply a cucurbital: because this, by\r\nlessening the distemper, may bring on sleep. Moderation must also be\r\nused as to his diet: for the patient must neither be full-fed, lest\r\nhe grow outrageous, nor must he be tormented with hunger, lest from\r\nhis weakness he fall into a cardiac disorder. He must use weak food,\r\nand especially gruel, and drink hydromel, three cyathi of which are\r\nsufficient in winter, and four in summer.\r\n\r\nThere is another kind of madness, which continues a longer time;\r\nbecause generally it begins without a fever, afterwards excites slight\r\nfeverish fits; and goes no farther than a sadness, which seems to\r\nproceed from atrabilis. In this bleeding is useful. If there be any\r\nreason against that, the first remedy is abstinence; the second to\r\npurge by white hellebore and vomiting: after either of these friction\r\nis to be used twice a day; if the patient be pretty strong, frequent\r\nexercise too, a vomit fasting, food of the middle kind is to be given\r\nwithout wine. As often as I mention this kind of food, I would be\r\nunderstood, that it may be given even of the weakest, provided one be\r\nnot confined to that alone: that only the strongest is to be refrained.\r\nBesides, the belly is to be kept as soft as possible: terrors are to be\r\ndispersed, and rather good hopes are to be given. Entertainment must be\r\nsought in amusing stories and diversions, such as the person in health\r\nused to be most pleased with. If there are any works of his performing,\r\nthey must be commended, and placed before his eyes. His groundless\r\nsorrow is to be mildly reprimanded. Arguments must be offered now and\r\nthen to persuade him, that in those very things, which disturb him,\r\nthere is more matter for joy than anxiety. If a fever has also come on,\r\nit must be cured in the same manner as other fevers.\r\n\r\nThe third kind of madness is the longest of all; insomuch that it does\r\nnot shorten life. Which kind is most incident to people of strong\r\nconstitutions. Now there are two species of this: for in some the\r\ndeception arises from _false_ images, not from the understanding:\r\nsuch a madness the fables of the poets represent that of Ajax, or\r\nOrestes(18): others are disordered in their judgment. If imaginations\r\nmislead, first of all it must be observed, whether they be melancholy\r\nor merry. If melancholy, black hellebore ought to be given as a purge;\r\nin the merry kind, the white as an emetic. And if the patient will not\r\ntake it in a potion, it must be added to bread, that it may the more\r\neasily deceive. For if he be thoroughly purged, it will in a great\r\nmeasure lessen the distemper. And therefore if hellebore once given has\r\ndone little service, after a proper interval it ought to be repeated.\r\nAnd it should be known that this distemper is more mild, when attended\r\nwith laughter, than with gravity. And this rule also is universal\r\nin all diseases, when any person is to be purged in the inferior\r\nparts(19), that the belly be first opened; when the superior parts,\r\nit must be bound.\r\n\r\nBut if the madness affect the judgment, the patient is best treated by\r\nsome kind of tortures. When he has said or done any thing wrong, he is\r\nto be punished by hunger, chains, and stripes: he must be forced both\r\nto attend and get something by heart, and retain it in his memory.\r\nFor thus it will happen, that gradually by fear he may be obliged to\r\nconsider, what he does. It is also serviceable in this disorder to be\r\nput into sudden consternation and fear; and the same tendency commonly\r\nhas every thing, that disturbs the mind greatly; for some change may\r\nbe brought about, when the mind is withdrawn from that state, in which\r\nit was before. It likewise makes a difference, whether the patient\r\nlaugh now and then without cause, or be sorrowful and dejected. For the\r\nmerriment of a mad person is better cured by those terrours, which I\r\nmentioned above. If sadness be his extreme, gentle, but long friction\r\ntwice a day is useful; also pouring of cold water upon the head, and\r\ndipping the body in water and oil.\r\n\r\nThe following are general rules: that mad people ought to be strongly\r\nexercised; to make much use of friction; to take neither fat flesh nor\r\nwine; to take food, after purging, of the middle kind, and as light as\r\npossible; that they should neither be alone, nor amongst strangers, nor\r\nthose which they either despise, or look upon with indifference: they\r\nought to go into other countries, and, if their judgement returns, to\r\ntake a journey into distant parts once a year.\r\n\r\nSometimes, though seldom, a delirium arises from fear; which kind of\r\nmadness is of a similar species, and is to be cured by a like diet:\r\nexcept that in this kind of madness alone wine is properly given.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. XIX.\r\n\r\nOF THE CARDIAC DISORDER AND ITS CURE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThat kind of distemper, which by the Greeks is called cardiacus[BH],\r\nis directly contrary to the last mentioned; although phrenitic people\r\noften fall into it: for the mind in that is disordered, in this it is\r\nsound. This is nothing else but an excessive weakness of the body;\r\nwhich from a languishing stomach is dissipated by immoderate sweating.\r\nAnd one may immediately know that this is the disease, when the\r\npulsations of the arteries are small and weak, and sweat uncommon both\r\nin degree and continuance, breaks out from the whole breast, and neck,\r\nand even from the head, the feet only and legs being more dry and cold.\r\nThis distemper is of the acute kind.\r\n\r\n  [BH] καρδιακὸς.\r\n\r\nThe first step in the cure is to apply restringent cataplasms to the\r\npræcordia; the second to restrain the sweat. That is accomplished by\r\nbitter oil, or that of roses, or quinces, or myrtles. With any of these\r\nthe body is to be gently anointed; and then a cerate of some one of\r\nthem is to be applied.\r\n\r\nIf the sweat nevertheless prevails, the person is to be rubbed over\r\nwith gypsum, or litharge, or Cimolian chalk, or to be sprinkled now\r\nand then with the powder of these. The same purpose is answered by the\r\npowder of dry myrtle or bramble-leaves, or the dried lees of austere\r\nand strong wine. And there are a great many more things of the same\r\nnature, which if they cannot be had, sprinkling of common dust will\r\nhave a good effect. And besides these, that the body may sweat less,\r\nthe person ought to be covered with a light garment, and set in a place\r\nnot hot, with the windows open, so that he may be even sensible of the\r\nstream of air.\r\n\r\nThe third remedy is to succour the weakness of the patient by eating\r\nand wine. Food is not to be given in great quantity indeed, but often,\r\nboth in the night and day; so as it may nourish, and not load. It\r\nought to be of the weakest kind, and agreeable to the stomach: and\r\nunless there be a necessity, we ought not to be in haste to give wine.\r\nIf there is reason to fear the person is fainting, then both intrita\r\nwith wine, and wine itself, austere but small, and somewhat diluted,\r\nwith the cold taken off it, may be given pretty frequently and freely;\r\nwith the addition of polenta(20), provided the patient takes little\r\nfood. And the wine ought to be neither very weak nor very strong: and\r\nthe patient in a day and a night may very well drink two or three\r\nheminæ; if it be a person of a large make, even more: if he has no\r\nappetite for food, it is fit first to anoint him, then to pour cold\r\nwater all over him, and then give it him.\r\n\r\nBut if his stomach be so relaxed, that it hardly retains, both before\r\nmeat and after it, he ought to vomit spontaneously(21); and again\r\nafter vomiting to take food. If even that do not stay, to sup a cyathus\r\nof wine, and at the distance of an hour to eat again. If the stomach\r\nreturn that too, the whole body must be rubbed over with bruised\r\nbulbous roots(22): when these have grown dry, the effect is, that the\r\nwine may be retained in the stomach, and from that, the heat may return\r\nto the whole body, and the tone of the vessels be restored.\r\n\r\nThe last remedy is to inject by way of clyster(23) the cream either\r\nof ptisan or alica, for that also will support the strength. Nor is\r\nit amiss to hold something refreshing, such as rose oil and wine, to\r\nthe nose of the person, when he is restless and hot: and if there is\r\nany coldness in the extremities, to cherish them with hands anointed\r\nand warm. By which means if we have been able to gain these points,\r\nthat the violence of the sweat abates, and life is prolonged, time\r\nitself now begins to work a cure. When he seems to be out of danger,\r\nyet we must be cautious, that he do not relapse quickly into the same\r\nweakness. Therefore omitting only the wine, he ought every day to take\r\nmore substantial food, till his body recover sufficient strength.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. XX.\r\n\r\nOF THE LETHARGY, AND ITS CURE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is also another distemper, which in a different way is opposite\r\nto the phrenitic one. In phrensies sleep is hardly obtained, there is\r\na disposition to fool-hardy enterprises: in this there is a languor,\r\nand an almost invincible necessity of sleeping. The Greeks call it\r\nlethargus[BI]. This too is of the acute kind, and unless it is cured,\r\nkills quickly.\r\n\r\n  [BI] λήθαργος.\r\n\r\nTherefore some endeavour to rouse such patients by holding to _their\r\nnose_ those things, which provoke sneezings, and such as excite by\r\ntheir offensive smell; for instance, burnt pitch, sordid wool, pepper,\r\nhellebore, castor, vinegar, garlick, onion. They also burn galbanum by\r\nthem, or hartshorn; if this is not to be got, any other horn; for when\r\nthese are burnt, they stimulate by their offensive smell.\r\n\r\nBut a certain _author_, Tharrias, affirmed, that this disposition to\r\nsleep is concomitant upon a _febrile_ paroxysm, and that it abates,\r\nwhen the latter is gone off: and therefore that such practitioners,\r\nas rouse them frequently, give them unnecessary pain. Now it makes a\r\nconsiderable difference whether the patient awakes upon the termination\r\nof the fit, or whether the weight of sleep oppresses him, when the\r\nfever is abating, or even after its going off. For if he awakes, it is\r\nneedless to treat him as one asleep: for he is not made better by being\r\nawake; but if he be better, he will keep awake of himself. If his sleep\r\nis continual, he must in such a case be roused; but at those times,\r\nwhen the fever is lowest, that he may discharge somewhat, and take\r\nfood. Cold water suddenly poured on excites more powerfully than any\r\nthing. After the remission therefore the whole body must be anointed\r\nover with a great quantity of oil, and three or four amphorae of water\r\nmust be poured upon the head, so as to stream over all the body. But\r\nthis we shall make use of, if the patient’s breathing be equal, if\r\nthe præcordia be soft. But if the case shall be different, the other\r\nremedies are preferable, which were mentioned before. And as to the\r\nsleep, this method is the most suitable.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the cure _of the distemper_, the head must be shaved;\r\nthen fomented with a decoction of bay-leaves, or of rue in vinegar\r\nand water. And the day after, castor must be applied, or rue bruised\r\nwith vinegar, or bay-berries, or ivy with rose-oil and vinegar. And\r\nmustard is of singular use, both held to the nostrils in rouzing the\r\npatient, and if applied to the top of the head or forehead, in removing\r\nthe distemper itself. Gestation is also useful in this distemper, and\r\nespecially food seasonably given, that is, in the greatest remission,\r\nthat can be found. Now gruel is most proper till the distemper begins\r\nto decline. And if every day there is a severe fit, this may be given\r\ndaily: if every other day, gruel after the most severe; after the\r\nmilder hydromel. Wine also given with seasonable food is of no small\r\nuse.\r\n\r\nBut if such a torpor has come after long fevers, all the other rules\r\nare to be observed: but three or four hours before the fit, if the\r\nbelly be bound, castor with a mixture of scammony must be given; if\r\nthat is not the case, castor alone must be given with water. If the\r\npræcordia are soft, the diet must be pretty full; if hard, we must\r\nkeep to the gruels above-mentioned; something being applied to the\r\npræcordia, which can at once repel and soften.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. XXI.\r\n\r\nOF THE SEVERAL SPECIES OF THE DROPSY AND THEIR CURE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe foregoing is an acute distemper; but the case of those, who are\r\ntroubled with water under the skin, may turn to a chronical disease:\r\nfor unless it is speedily cured, such patients fall into what the\r\nGreeks call hydrops[BJ] (_dropsy_). There are three species of it;\r\nfor at times the belly is very tense, and there is a frequent\r\nrumbling within from the motion of the air: sometimes the surface of\r\nthe body is unequal, with tumours of different sizes rising over the\r\nwhole: sometimes water is confined within the abdomen, and upon the\r\nbody’s being moved, it moves in such a manner, that the course of it\r\nmay be seen. The first the Greeks call tympanites[BK]; the second\r\nleucophlegmatia, or hyposarca[BL]; the third ascites[BM]. An excess of\r\nmoisture however is common to them all: for which reason ulcers in such\r\npatients are not easily healed. This disease often begins of itself;\r\nand often succeeds another distemper of long standing, and especially a\r\nquartan.\r\n\r\n  [BJ] ὕδρωψ.\r\n\r\n  [BK] τυμπανίτης.\r\n\r\n  [BL] λευκοφλεγματία vel ὑπὸ τὴν σάρκα.\r\n\r\n  [BM] ἀσκίτης.\r\n\r\nIt is more easily cured in slaves, than in free people; because as it\r\nrequires fasting, enduring of thirst, and a thousand other hardships,\r\nand long patience, such are more readily relieved, that are easily\r\ncommanded, than those, whose liberty is hurtful to them. But even\r\nthose, that are under the authority of another, if they cannot entirely\r\ncommand themselves, are not to be recovered. And upon this account no\r\ninconsiderable physician, a disciple of Chrysippus, residing with king\r\nAntigonus, declared that a certain friend of that prince, of known\r\nintemperance, though not very ill of this disease, could not possibly\r\nbe cured: and when another physician, Philip of Epirus, undertook to\r\ncure him, he answered, that the other considered only the distemper of\r\nthe patient; he, his dispositions. And he was not deceived; for though\r\nhe was watched with the greatest diligence not only by the physician,\r\nbut even by the king too, yet by devouring his malagmas(24), and\r\ndrinking his own urine, he quickly killed himself.\r\n\r\nHowever at the beginning the cure is not very difficult, if rest,\r\nthirst, and fasting be strictly enjoined. But if the disease has\r\ncontinued long, it is not removed without great trouble. Yet they tell\r\nus, that Metrodorus, a disciple of Epicurus, when he was afflicted with\r\nthis distemper, and could not patiently endure the necessary thirst,\r\nafter refraining long, used to drink, and then vomit it again. Now if\r\nwhatever has been taken, be brought up again, it lessens the uneasiness\r\nconsiderably: if it is retained in the stomach, it increases the\r\ndisorder; therefore it must not be attempted in every one.\r\n\r\nBut if it be attended with a fever, that in the first place must be\r\nremoved by such means as have been prescribed for the cure of that\r\ndistemper. When the patient is free of a fever, then we may apply the\r\nusual remedies of the dropsy. And with regard to this, whatever species\r\nit is, if it has not got too deep root, the very same remedies are\r\nnecessary. The person must walk much, run sometimes, and his superior\r\nparts especially must be rubbed, so as to bring a warmth into the skin.\r\nIn the mean time he must keep in his breath. Sweat is likewise to be\r\nprocured, not by exercise only, but also by hot sand, or the laconicum,\r\nor clibanum, and such like means: and natural and dry sweating places\r\nare very beneficial: such as we have at Bajæ amongst the groves of\r\nmyrtles. The bath and all moisture is hurtful. Catapotia(25),\r\ncomposed of two parts of wormwood and one of myrrh, are properly given\r\nto the patient fasting.\r\n\r\nThe food ought to be of a middle nature, but of the harder kind of\r\nit. No more drink given than to support life: and that is best, which\r\nprovokes urine. It is better to attempt that by diet(26), than\r\nmedicine. However, if there is a necessity, some of the things, which\r\nhave that effect, must be boiled, and the decoction of them given to\r\ndrink. This faculty seems to be possessed by the iris, nard(27),\r\nsaffron, cinnamon, cassia, myrrh, balsam(28), galbanum, labdanum,\r\nflower of the wild vine, panaces(29), cardamom(30), ebony,\r\ncypress seed, stavesacre, which the Greeks call staphis agria[BN],\r\nsouthernwood, rose-leaves, acorum(31), bitter almonds, goat’s\r\nmarjoram, storax, costus, the flower of long and round cyperus(32);\r\nthe first of these the Greeks call cyperus[BO], and the other\r\nschœnus[BP]. Whenever I mention these, I intend not such as grow here,\r\nbut those that are imported amongst the spices. However the mildest\r\nof these must be tried first, that is the rose-leaves, or spikenard.\r\nAustere wine also, but very weak, is good.\r\n\r\n  [BN] σαφὶς ἀγρία.\r\n\r\n  [BO] κύπειρος.\r\n\r\n  [BP] σχο̃ινος.\r\n\r\nIt is convenient likewise to measure the belly every day with a thread,\r\nand to put a mark upon this, where it meets: and each succeeding day\r\nto observe, whether the bulk be enlarged or diminished; for that which\r\nlessens, feels the effect of the medicine. And it is not improper to\r\nmeasure the patient’s drink, and his urine; for if more moisture is\r\nexcreted, than is taken, in such a case there is hope of recovery.\r\nAsclepiades tells us in his writings, that to a person, who had fallen\r\ninto a dropsy after a quartan, he prescribed abstinence for two days,\r\nand friction; on the third he gave him food and wine, finding him free\r\nboth of the fever and dropsy. Thus far general rules may be laid down\r\nfor all the species of the distemper: if the malady rises to a greater\r\nheight, different methods of cure are required in each.\r\n\r\nWherefore if there is a flatulency, and from that frequent pain, a\r\nvomit after meat every day, or every other day, is of service. After\r\nthat dry and warm fomentations must be used. If the pain is not removed\r\nby these means, cupping without scarification is necessary. If the pain\r\ndoes not even yield to that, the skin must be cut, and the cucurbitals\r\napplied again. The last remedy, if the cupping has done no service,\r\nis to inject into the belly plenty of warm water, and to take it back\r\nagain. Moreover it is necessary to make use of friction three or four\r\ntimes a day, with oil and some heating medicines. But in this friction\r\nthe belly must be avoided; mustard must be applied to it frequently,\r\ntill it corrode the skin; and several ulcers must be made in the belly\r\nwith hot irons, and these kept open for some time. Boiled squils also\r\nbound upon the skin(33) are good. But for a long time after these\r\nflatulencies all windy food must be avoided.\r\n\r\nBut if the distemper be what is called leucophlegmatia, it is fit to\r\nexpose the swelled parts to the sun; but not too much, lest it inflame\r\nthe fever. If the sun is too powerful, the head must be covered, and\r\nfriction made use of, the hands being only moistened with water mixed\r\nwith salt, and nitre, and a little oil; and that by the hands either\r\nof a child or a woman, as their touch is softer: and if the strength\r\nwill allow, it may be continued a whole hour in the forenoon; in the\r\nafternoon for half an hour. Restringent cataplasms also are good;\r\nespecially if the body be pretty tender. An incision must likewise\r\nbe made on the inside of the leg, about four fingers breadth above\r\nthe ancle; from which for some days a good quantity of water may be\r\ndischarged, and it is proper also to make deep gashes in the tumours:\r\nand the body must be well agitated by frequent gestation; and when the\r\nwounds are cicatrized, the exercise and food must be increased, till\r\nthe body return to its former habit. The food ought to be strong and\r\nglutinous, and chiefly flesh. The wine pretty sweet, if the stomach\r\nwill bear it; but in this course, that alternately for two or three\r\ndays together, sometimes water and sometimes wine be drunk. It is\r\nproper also to give the seed of sea spurge, which grows large near the\r\nsea, to drink with water. If the person be strong, boiled squills may\r\nbe tied upon his belly at the same time. And many authors advise, that\r\nthe tumours be beat with inflated bladders.\r\n\r\nBut if the disease be of that kind, in which there is a large\r\ncollection of water within the abdomen, it is fit to walk, but more\r\nmoderately; to keep a discutient malagma applied to the part, with a\r\ntriple cloth above it, and to bind it on with a roller, though not\r\ntoo tight. Which practice, introduced by Tharrias, I observe is still\r\ncontinued by the greatest number of physicians. If it is evident,\r\nthat the liver or spleen is affected, it is proper to apply over it a\r\nmellow fig bruised, with the addition of honey. If by such remedies\r\nthe belly is not dried, but the water notwithstanding abounds, a more\r\nspeedy method must be taken to relieve, that is, to discharge it by\r\nthe belly itself. Nor am I ignorant, that Erasistratus disapproved of\r\nthis method of cure: for he imagined this to be a distemper of the\r\nliver; and therefore that means should be used to restore that part to\r\na sound state, and that it was to no purpose to draw off the water,\r\nwhich, while that bowel is distempered, Would be presently collected\r\nagain. But in the first place, this bowel is not only the seat of this\r\ndisease: for it arises both in the case of an affected spleen, and a\r\nbad habit of the whole body. And secondly, supposing it to have begun\r\nthence, yet unless the water be discharged, which stagnates there\r\npreternaturally, it hurts both the liver and the other internal parts.\r\nAnd it is granted, that care should be taken nevertheless to cure the\r\nwhole body. For discharging of the water does not work a cure, but\r\nmakes room for the operation of medicine, which that obstructs, while\r\nit remains there. Neither does this admit of any dispute, that all in\r\nthis disease are not to be thus treated: but robust young men may, who\r\nare either entirely free of a fever, or at least have pretty long\r\nintermissions: for those, who have a vitiated stomach, or have fallen\r\ninto this disorder from the atrabilis, or those, who are in a bad habit\r\nof body, are not fit subjects for this treatment. On the day, that\r\nthe water is first discharged, giving of food is improper, unless the\r\npatient feels a want of strength. In the following days indeed wine not\r\nmuch diluted ought to be given, but not in a large quantity, and the\r\npatient must be again gradually accustomed to exercises, frictions,\r\nthe heat of the sun, sweatings, fatigues, and proper food, till he be\r\nentirely well. The case requires seldom bathing, and frequent vomits\r\nwhen fasting. If it be the summer-time, it is proper to swim in the\r\nsea. For a long time after his recovery venery is hurtful.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. XXII.\r\n\r\nOF THE SEVERAL KINDS OF CONSUMPTION AND THEIR CURE.\r\n\r\n\r\nA consumption is a distemper often of longer continuance, and attended\r\nwith greater danger. And of this also there are several species. One\r\nof them is, where the body is not nourished, and as something is\r\nnaturally always flying off, and nothing comes in to supply its place,\r\nthe person becomes extremely emaciated, and unless it be removed, it\r\nproves mortal. This the Greeks call atrophia[BQ]. It commonly proceeds\r\nfrom one of two causes: for one man through excessive fear takes less,\r\nanother from too great voraciousness takes more food, than he ought to\r\ndo: so that either the defect of aliment weakens, or what is redundant\r\nis corrupted.\r\n\r\n  [BQ] ἀτροφία.\r\n\r\nThere is another species, which the Greeks call cachexia[BR], where the\r\nhabit of the body is bad, and therefore all the aliments are corrupted:\r\nwhich commonly happens, when bodies depraved by a long distemper,\r\nalthough they have got quite rid of it, yet do not receive any recruit;\r\nor when the body has been disordered by bad medicines; or when one\r\nhas long wanted the necessaries of life; or has made use of victuals\r\nto which he is not accustomed, and bad, or from some such accident. In\r\nthis last case besides the consumption it sometimes happens, that the\r\nskin is exasperated with frequent pimples(34), or ulcers, or some\r\nparts of the body swell.\r\n\r\n  [BR] καχεξία.\r\n\r\nThe third and by far the most dangerous species is that, to which the\r\nGreeks give the name of phthisis[BS]. It generally takes its rise from\r\nthe head(35): and thence falls down upon the lungs. From this an\r\nexulceration proceeds, and there comes a slight fever, which, although\r\nit may have abated, yet returns; in this also there is a frequent\r\ncough, and pus expectorated, and sometimes something bloody. Whatever\r\ncomes up, if it be thrown upon the fire, has a bad smell. Therefore\r\nthose, that are doubtful of the distemper, try it by this mark.\r\n\r\n  [BS] φθίσις.\r\n\r\nAs these are the several species of a consumption, it is necessary\r\nfirst to consider, which of them is the disease of the patient. Then\r\nif it appears, that the body is only not supplied with nourishment,\r\nto attend to the cause of that; and if the person has taken less\r\nfood, than he ought to have done, it is proper to make an addition:\r\nbut gradually, lest, if he overload the body unaccustomed to it by\r\ntoo great a quantity at once, the stomach be oppressed, and and that\r\nretard concoction. If a person has been used to take more than what\r\nwas proper, he should fast for one day; then begin with a little food;\r\nmaking every day some small addition, till he come to a just measure.\r\nIt is like-wise proper to walk in places as cold as possible, and avoid\r\nthe heat of the sun; to use those exercises, which employ the hands: if\r\nhe is weaker, to use gestation, unction, and friction, by his own hands\r\nrather than other if he be able, frequently in the day, both before\r\nmeat and after it; and sometimes to add some of the warming medicines\r\nto the oil, till he sweats. It does service too when he is fasting\r\nto take hold of his skin in many parts, and to draw it out, that it\r\nmay be relaxed; or to do the same by often impressing a bit of resin\r\nupon it, and quickly pulling it away again. Bathing also is sometimes\r\ngood, but after a small meal; and even in the bath itself, some food\r\nis properly given; or if without the bath friction has been used, it\r\nmay be immediately after. The food ought to be of that kind, which is\r\neasily concocted and most nourishing. Therefore the use of wine also,\r\nbut austere, is necessary to promote urine.\r\n\r\nBut if the habit of the body is bad, the first thing to be done is to\r\nfast; then a clyster must be administered; next we should give food,\r\nadding exercises, unctions, and frictions. Frequent bathing is more\r\nbeneficial to such, but when they are fasting, even till they sweat.\r\nTheir diet should be plentiful and varied, of good juices, and such as\r\ndoes not very easily corrupt, and austere wine. If these methods do not\r\nrelieve, blood must be let; but by small quantities, and every day for\r\nsome days together, the other rules above laid down being also observed.\r\n\r\nBut if the distemper is more violent, and there is a true phthisis, it\r\nis necessary to oppose its beginnings: for if this distemper continue\r\nlong, it is not easily overcome. If the patient’s strength allow, he\r\nmust take a long voyage, change his climate, taking care to remove\r\ninto a grosser air, than that he leaves; and therefore from Italy to\r\nAlexandria is a very agreeable change. And generally at the beginning\r\nthe body may be well supposed able to stand that fatigue, since this\r\ndistemper generally comes on at the strongest age, that is, from the\r\neighteenth year to the thirty-fifth. If the weakness will not admit of\r\nthat, it is very proper however to sail in a ship, but not far. But\r\nif any circumstance render the sailing unfit, the body must be moved\r\nin a litter or some other way; then business must be laid aside, and\r\nevery thing, which disturbs the mind; sleep must be indulged; catarrhs\r\navoided, lest they exasperate, what may have been mitigated by care;\r\nand for that reason crudity must be guarded against, and at the same\r\ntime both the heat of the sun and cold, the face defended, the throat\r\nwrapped up, and the cough removed by its peculiar remedies. And as\r\nlong as the fever continues to attack, it must be treated sometimes by\r\nabstinence, sometimes also by seasonable food: and at such time water\r\nmust be drunk. Milk likewise, which is poison in pains of the head, and\r\nacute fevers, and excessive thirst, occasioned by these, and when the\r\npræcordia are swelled, or the urine is bilious, or in hæmorrhages; yet\r\nin a phthisis, as well as in all tedious and obstinate febriculas, it\r\nmay very well be given.\r\n\r\nBut if a fever does not yet come on, or has already remitted, recourse\r\nmust be had to moderate exercise, and especially walking and gentle\r\nfriction. The bath is hurtful. The food at first ought to be pungent,\r\nsuch as garlick, leeks, and the same in vinegar, or in the same way\r\nendive, basil, lettuce; afterwards mild, as gruel(36) made from\r\nptisan, or alica, or from starch, with the addition of milk. Rice also,\r\nand, if there is nothing else, far will answer the same end. Then\r\nthese two sorts of food are to be alternately used; and something of\r\nthe middle kind is to be added, and especially brains(37), and small\r\nfish, and such like. Flour also mixed with mutton or goat’s suet, and\r\nboiled, serves for a medicine. Wine ought to be taken light and austere.\r\n\r\nThus far the distemper is combated with no great difficulty. If it is\r\nmore grievous, and neither the fever nor the cough abate, and the body\r\nappears to be wasting, there is a necessity for more powerful remedies.\r\nAn ulcer must be made with a hot iron in one place under the chin,\r\nanother in the throat, two at both breasts, and under the extremity of\r\nthe blade-bones, which the Greeks call omoplatæ[BT]; and these ulcers\r\nmust not be allowed to heal, unless the cough should cease: which,\r\nit is plain, must also require a distinct method of cure. Then the\r\nextremities are to be brushed briskly three or four times a day; the\r\nchest must be rubbed gently with the hand; after meat, at the interval\r\nof an hour, the legs and arms must also be rubbed. After ten days the\r\npatient is to be put into a bath consisting of warm water and oil. On\r\nthe other days he is to drink water; at that time wine must be given\r\nto drink cold, if the cough is gone; if it is not, with the cold taken\r\noff. It is proper also in the remissions to give food every day; to\r\nmake use of friction and gestation in like manner; on the fourth or\r\nfifth day to take sometimes the blood herb with vinegar, or to eat\r\nplantain. The juice of plantain alone, or that of horehound boiled up\r\nwith honey, is a remedy; of the first of which a cyathus may be supped,\r\nand a spoonful of the other may be licked at times; or one part of\r\nturpentine, and another of butter and honey, mixed together and boiled.\r\nBut the most material of all these things, are the diet, gestation,\r\nsailing, and gruel. A loose belly is particularly to be avoided. A\r\nfrequent vomiting in this distemper, and especially of blood, is\r\npernicious. When a person begins to grow a little better, he ought to\r\nincrease his exercises, friction and food; and then keeping in his\r\nbreath to rub himself; to abstain long from wine, the bath, and venery.\r\n\r\n  [BT] ὠμοπλάται.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. XXIII.\r\n\r\nOF THE EPILEPSY AND ITS CURE.\r\n\r\n\r\nAmongst the best known distempers is that, which is called\r\ncomitial(38), or the greater. A man falls suddenly down, foams at the\r\nmouth; then after some time returns to himself, and rises of his own\r\naccord. This disorder more frequently attacks men than women; and it\r\ncommonly continues long, even to the dying day, and is not dangerous to\r\nlife. Sometimes however, when it is recent, it kills a person; and if\r\nit has not been removed by remedies, it is often cured in boys by their\r\nfirst venereal liberties, in females by the first appearance of the\r\nmenses. Sometimes a person falls down with a convulsion of the limbs or\r\nnerves, sometimes without it.\r\n\r\nSome endeavour to rouze these by the same means as lethargic people;\r\nwhich is quite needless: both because even a lethargic person is not\r\ncured by this method; and because he may never awake, and thus perish\r\nfor want, whereas the other returns to himself.\r\n\r\nWhen one falls down, if _the fit_ be not attended with a convulsion,\r\nblood ought to be let immediately: if it is, that is not to be done,\r\nunless other circumstances also encourage it. But it is necessary to\r\ngive clysters, or to purge with black hellebore, or to do both, if\r\nthe strength will allow; then to clip the hair of the head _close_,\r\nand anoint it over with oil and vinegar; to give food the third day\r\nafter, as soon as the hour, at which the patient fell down, is past.\r\nNeither are gruels, or victuals otherwise soft and easy of digestion,\r\nor flesh, and least of all pork, fit for such persons; but diet of the\r\nmiddle kind: for the case requires strength; and crudities are to be\r\nguarded against. At the same time they should avoid the heat of the\r\nsun, the bath, fire, and every thing heating; also cold, wine, venery,\r\nthe sight of a precipice, and every thing that terrifies, vomiting,\r\nlassitude, anxieties, all business; and when food has been given on the\r\nthird day, they should intermit the fourth, and so on every other day;\r\nobserving the same hour for food for fourteen days. When the distemper\r\nhas proceeded so far, it has lost the force of an acute one; and if it\r\ncontinues, it must be treated as a chronic.\r\n\r\nBut if a physician has not been called on the day, that the person\r\nfirst fell, but has a man recommended to his care, who is already used\r\nto these falling fits; first of all the regimen above prescribed being\r\nfollowed, the day is to be expected, on which the fit may return: and\r\nthen either bleeding must be used, or a clyster, or black hellebore,\r\nas has been already directed. Then in the following days, he is to be\r\nnourished by the food mentioned before, omitting all such as I said\r\nwere to be avoided.\r\n\r\nIf the distemper should not be removed by these means, recourse must be\r\nhad to the white hellebore; and that must be used three or four times,\r\nat the distance of a few days betwixt doses; provided however that he\r\nnever repeat it, unless the fit have recurred. On the intermediate days\r\nhis strength must be supported by adding some other things to those,\r\nwhich have been mentioned before. When he has waked in the morning, his\r\nbody may be gently rubbed over with old oil, excepting his head and\r\nbelly; then let him take a walk, as long and as straight as possible;\r\nafter the walk let him be rubbed, in a tepid place briskly and long,\r\nand not less than two hundred times; unless he be infirm; then let a\r\ngood quantity of cold water be poured over his head; let him eat a\r\nlittle; and rest; take a walk again before night; be briskly rubbed a\r\nsecond time, without touching either his belly or head; afterwards let\r\nhim take supper, and with intervals of three or four days, let him for\r\na day or two together make use of a pungent diet.\r\n\r\nIf the patient should not be cured even by these means, let his head\r\nbe shaved, anointed with old oil, adding to it vinegar and nitre, and\r\nsalt water poured upon it; when he is fasting, let him drink castor\r\nand water; make use of no water for drink, unless it has been boiled.\r\nSome have cured themselves of such a disorder by drinking the warm\r\nblood of a gladiator slain. With such people a miserable remedy is\r\nrendered tolerable by a more miserable distemper. As to the assistance\r\nof medicine, the last remedy is to let a little blood from both legs\r\nnear the ancle; to make an incision on the back of the head, and apply\r\ncucurbitals; with a hot iron also to make an eschar in two places, in\r\nthe back of the head, and below, where the first vertebra is joined\r\nto the head; that by these the noxious humour may be discharged. If\r\nby this method the distemper has not been removed, it will probably\r\ncontinue for life. To alleviate it, exercise must only be used, and\r\nsuch food, as has been directed above; and especially every thing\r\navoided, against which we have given cautions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. XXIV.\r\n\r\nOF THE JAUNDICE AND ITS CURE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe distemper is equally known, which is called sometimes\r\narquatus(39), sometimes regius. If this comes on after the seventh\r\nday of a fever, Hippocrates pronounces the patient to be safe, provided\r\nonly the præcordia be soft. Diocles declares without reserve, that if\r\nit comes after a fever, it even does good; if a fever follows it, it is\r\nmortal. Now this distemper is discovered by the colour, especially of\r\nthe eyes, in which, what ought to be white, becomes yellow. And it is\r\ngenerally attended by a thirst, pain of the head, frequent hiccough,\r\nhardness of the præcordia on the right side; and upon violent motion,\r\na difficulty of breathing, and relaxation of the limbs: and when the\r\ndistemper continues long, the whole body turns white, with a certain\r\nsickly paleness.\r\n\r\nFor the first day it is proper to enjoin the patient to abstinence; on\r\nthe second to give a clyster; then if there is a fever, to remove it by\r\nproper diet; if there is not, to give scammony to drink, or white betes\r\nshred in water, or in hydromel bitter almonds, wormwood, anise, but of\r\nthe last the smallest quantity. Asclepiades ordered also the drinking\r\nof salt water, and that for two days, with an intention to purge,\r\nrejecting the use of diuretics. Some omitting the former, by the latter\r\nand extenuating diet affirm they obtain the same purpose.\r\n\r\nFor my part if there be sufficient strength, I prefer the stronger\r\nmedicines; if but little, the weaker remedies. If the patient has been\r\npurged, after that it is fit for the three first days to eat sparingly\r\nfood of the middle kind, and drink Greek salt wine, that the belly may\r\ncontinue lax; then for other three days to eat more substantial food\r\nand some flesh too; and hold to the use of water for drink; then to\r\nreturn to the former diet, only eating more freely of it; and omitting\r\nthe Greek, to drink black austere wine; and vary this course by using\r\nsometimes acrid food, sometimes returning to the salt wine. But through\r\nthe whole time exercise and friction must be used, and if it be winter,\r\nthe bath, if summer, swimming in cold water; a bed and room elegant,\r\ncompany, place, diversions, frolicks, and every thing else, that has\r\na tendency to exhilarate the mind: upon which accounts it seems to be\r\ncalled the royal distemper. A discutient malgama also applied to the\r\npræcordia has a good effect; or a dry fig laid on there, if the liver\r\nor spleen be affected.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. XXV.\r\n\r\nOF THE ELEPHANTIASIS, AND ITS CURE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThat distemper, which the Greeks call elephantiasis[BU], is almost\r\nentirely unknown in Italy, but in some countries is very common, and\r\nis ranked amongst the chronic kind. The whole body is affected with it\r\nin such a manner, that even the bones are said to be spoilt. Upon the\r\nsurface of the body are spots and tumours. Their redness by degrees\r\ndegenerates into a black colour, the skin is unequally thick and thin,\r\nhard and soft, and is roughened with something resembling scales, the\r\nbody wastes, the face, legs, and feet swell. When the distemper is\r\ninveterate, the fingers and toes are hid under the swelling; a slight\r\nfever comes on, which easily destroys the person sunk under so many\r\nmaladies.\r\n\r\n  [BU] ἐλεφαντίασις.\r\n\r\nWherefore without delay, at the beginning of the disease, blood ought\r\nto be let two days successively; or the belly purged with black\r\nhellebore. For three days the person should fast, or eat no more than\r\nis necessary to support him; then the strength is to be recruited a\r\nlittle, and a clyster administered. After that, when he is somewhat\r\nrelieved, exercise must be used, especially running; sweat must be\r\nprocured, first by pure labour, and then by dry sweating-rooms;\r\nfriction applied; but these with such moderation, that the strength may\r\nbe preserved; bathing should be rare; the food without any thing fat,\r\nor glutinous, or flatulent. It is fit to allow wine, but not in the\r\nfirst days of the disorder. Plantain bruised and rubbed upon the body\r\nseems to be an excellent defence for it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. XXVI.\r\n\r\nOF APOPLECTIC PATIENTS, AND THEIR CURE.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn this country we _sometimes_, _though_ rarely see apoplectic people,\r\nwho are stupified both in body and mind. It happens sometimes from\r\nbeing thunderstruck, sometimes from a distemper. The last case the\r\nGreeks call apoplexia[BV]. Such people must be bled. And either white\r\nhellebore be made use of, or a clyster given. Then friction is to be\r\napplied; and food taken of the middle kind, by no means fat; some of\r\nthe acrid kinds too; and wine must be refrained.\r\n\r\n  [BV] ἀποπληξία.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. XXVII.\r\n\r\nOF THE PALSY, AND ITS CURE.\r\n\r\n\r\nBut a relaxation of the nerves is a distemper every where common.\r\nBut sometimes it attacks the whole body, sometimes particular parts.\r\nAncient authors called the first apoplexia, the other paralysis: now\r\nI observe the name of paralysis is given to both. And it is common\r\nfor those, who have all their limbs extremely relaxed, to be quickly\r\ncarried off. And if they are not snatched away, they live indeed for\r\nsome time, but yet seldom recover their health; and for the most part\r\ndraw out a miserable life, with the loss of their memory too. When\r\nit is partial, it is sometimes an acute distemper, often chronic,\r\ngenerally incurable.\r\n\r\nIf all the limbs are greatly affected, bleeding either kills or cures.\r\nAny other method scarcely ever restores health; often only delays\r\ndeath; in the mean time renders life uneasy. After bleeding, if both\r\nmotion and the judgment don’t return, there is no hope left: if they do\r\nreturn, there is a prospect of recovery.\r\n\r\nBut where a particular part is relaxed, either blood is to be let, or\r\na clyster administered, according to the strength of the body and the\r\ndistemper. All the other methods to be pursued are the same in both\r\ncases. For the principal thing is to avoid cold: and the patient must\r\nreturn gradually to exercise, so as immediately to apply to walking,\r\nif he can. If the weakness of his legs be too great for that, he\r\nmay either use gestation, or be agitated by moving his bed _to and\r\nfro_: then that member, which is diseased, may be moved of itself if\r\npossible; if that cannot be done, let another person move it, and so\r\nreturn it to its ordinary habit by a kind of force. It does good also\r\nto irritate the skin of the benumbed limb, either by beating it with\r\nnettles, or keeping mustard upon it, till the part begins to grow\r\nred; when they may be removed. Bruised squills likewise, or bulbous\r\nroots bruised with frankincense, are proper applications. Neither is\r\nit amiss, to vellicate the skin with resin for some time every third\r\nday, and that in several places; and sometimes to make use of cupping\r\nwithout scarification. Old oil is fittest for unction, or nitre mixed\r\nwith vinegar and oil. Further, it is highly necessary to foment with\r\nwarm sea-water; or if that is not to be got, with salt-water at least.\r\nAnd if any where there is a natural or artificial place for swimming\r\nin this kind of water, by all means to make use of it; and the limbs,\r\nwhich are most disordered, are to be principally agitated there. If\r\nthat conveniency cannot be had, nevertheless the bath is useful. The\r\nfood ought to be of the middle kind, and chiefly venison; the drink\r\nwarm water, without wine. But if the distemper is of long standing,\r\nGreek salt wine may be given as a purge every fourth or fifth day. A\r\nvomit after supper is good.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Of pain of the nerves._]\r\n\r\nSometimes there occurs also a pain of the nerves. In this case it is\r\nnot convenient, either to vomit, or promote urine by medicines, or\r\nsweats by exercise, a practice advised by some _physicians_. Water\r\nmust be drunk twice a day. The body must be rubbed all over gently in\r\nbed for a pretty long time; then the upper parts especially are to be\r\nmoved, keeping in the breath even in the time of the exercise. Bathing\r\nmust be seldom practised. The air must be changed now and then by\r\ntravelling. If there is a pain in any part, it must be anointed with\r\nnitre and water without oil, then wrapped up, and a small quantity of\r\nlive coals with sulphur held below it; and thus it is to be fumigated;\r\nand this is to be continued for some time, but when the patient is\r\nfasting, and after he has concocted well. Cucurbitals also are to be\r\noften applied to the part pained, and the same place is to be beat\r\ngently with inflated ox-bladders. It is good also to mix suet with\r\nthe powdered seed of cummin or nettle, in equal quantities, and apply\r\nthat; to foment with a decoction of sulphur in water. Bottles filled\r\nwith warm water are also proper to be clapped on, or bitumen mixed with\r\nbarley. Violent gestation must be used, especially in the very article\r\nof the pain, which in other pains is very pernicious.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Of a tremour of the nerves._]\r\n\r\nA tremour of the nerves is equally increased by vomiting, and diuretic\r\nmedicines. The bath and dry sweatings also are hurtful. Water must\r\nbe drunk; the patient must walk briskly, also anoint, use friction,\r\nchiefly performed by himself; his superior parts must be opened by\r\nplaying at the ball and the like exercises. He may take any food he\r\nchuses, only consulting the concoction. After meat he must avoid cares;\r\nmake very little use of venery. If at any time he falls into that,\r\nafter it he ought to be rubbed for a long time in his bed with oil, by\r\nthe hands of a boy rather than a man.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Of internal suppurations._]\r\n\r\nAs for suppurations(40), which happen in any internal part, when\r\nthey begin, our first business is to endeavour by repellent cataplasms\r\nto prevent a hurtful collection of matter; and then, if these have no\r\neffect, to disperse it by discutient malagmas. If we fail in that, it\r\nfollows that it be encouraged; next, that it be maturated. And then the\r\nend of every vomica is, that it breaks; and the symptom of this is an\r\nevacuation of matter, either by the mouth or anus. But nothing ought\r\nto be done, by which a full discharge of the pus may be prevented.\r\nGruels and warm water must be chiefly used. When the pus has ceased\r\nto be discharged, we are to change to such food, as is indeed of easy\r\n_concoction_, but yet more substantial and cold; also cold water, but\r\nbeginning with taking the cold off both: and at first some things may\r\nbe eaten with honey, as pine-nuts, or sweet almonds, or hazel-nuts.\r\nAfterwards even the honey must be omitted, that a cicatrix may be the\r\nsooner formed. At that time the proper medicine for the ulcer is taking\r\nthe juice of leeks or horehound, and adding leeks to every meal. It\r\nwill be convenient also to use frictions in those parts, that are not\r\naffected, and gentle walks. And care must be taken not to irritate the\r\nhealing ulcers either by struggling or running, or any other means; for\r\nin this distemper, a vomiting of blood is destructive, and therefore by\r\nall means to be guarded against.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA. CORNELIUS CELSUS\r\n\r\n        OF\r\n\r\n     MEDICINE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_BOOK IV._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. I.\r\n\r\nOF THE INTERNAL PARTS OF THE HUMAN BODY.\r\n\r\n\r\nThus far we have spoken of those kinds of distempers, which so affect\r\nthe whole body, that no certain seats can be assigned to them: I shall\r\nnow treat of those which belong to particular parts. Now the diseases\r\nof all the internal parts, and their method of cure will be more easily\r\nunderstood, when I shall have first given a short description of the\r\nparts they afflict.\r\n\r\nThe head then and what is contained in the mouth are bounded not only\r\nby the tongue and palate, but by the external parts, which lie exposed\r\nto view. On the right and left side about the throat are large veins,\r\nwhich are called sphagitides[BW]; and arteries, named carotides[BX],\r\nrunning upwards, which reach beyond the ears. And in the neck itself\r\nare placed small glands, which sometimes swell, and are painful.\r\nThen two passages begin: one of which is called the aspera arteria,\r\nor wind-pipe; the other the gullet. The wind-pipe is more external,\r\nand goes to the lungs; the gullet more internal, and leads to the\r\nstomach. The former receives the breath, the latter the food. Their\r\ncourses being different, where they meet there is something like a\r\nsmall tongue(1) in the wind-pipe at the entrance of the fauces: when\r\nwe breathe this stands erect; when we take meat or drink, it shuts\r\nthe wind-pipe. Now the wind-pipe being hard and cartilaginous, is\r\nprominent in the throat; and elsewhere falls back. It is composed of\r\ncertain circles formed like the vertebræ in the spine, yet so, that\r\nit is rough on the external part, on the internal smooth like the\r\ngullet; and thus descending to the præcordia it is connected with the\r\nlungs: these are of a spongy nature, and therefore capacious of air;\r\nand behind being joined to the spine, they are divided into two lobes\r\nlike an ox’s hoof. With these the heart is connected, being muscular,\r\nsituated in the thorax under the left breast: and it has what we may\r\ncall two ventricles. But under the heart and lungs is the transverse\r\nseptum, consisting of a strong membrane equally nervous, which divides\r\nthe abdomen from the præcordia, many vessels also being dispersed over\r\nit: it separates from the superior parts not only the intestines, but\r\nthe liver and spleen too. These bowels are next to it, but placed below\r\nit, the one on the right side, and the other on the left. The liver\r\nhaving its origin under the præcordia from the very septum itself, on\r\nthe inside is concave, and the outside gibbous. This projecting rests\r\ngently upon the stomach, and is divided into four lobes. On the lower\r\npart, the gall-bladder adheres to it. But in the left side the spleen\r\nis not connected with the septum, but to an intestine; it is of a\r\nsoft and loose texture, of a moderate length and thickness; and this\r\nproceeding a little beyond the region of the ribs into the abdomen, is\r\nchiefly covered by them. And these indeed are joined. But the kidneys\r\nare divided: which adhere to the loins below the last ribs(2), and\r\nthe sides next these are round, on the other they turn inward; they\r\nare both stocked with vessels, and covered over with coats(3). These\r\nthen are the situations of the bowels. But the gullet, which is the\r\nbeginning of the intestines, arises nervous from the seventh vertebra\r\nof the spine, and about the præcordia is united with the stomach.\r\nThe stomach, which is the receptacle of food, consists of two coats,\r\nand is placed betwixt the spleen and liver, each of these going a\r\nlittle over it. There are also some fine membranes, by which these\r\nthree are connected together, and are joined to the transverse septum\r\nabove-mentioned. After that the lower part of the stomach turning\r\na little to the right side grows narrower, till it meet the first\r\nintestine. This juncture the Greeks call pylorus[BY]; because like\r\na gate it emits into the lower parts, what we are to discharge by\r\nexcrement. There begins the intestine jejunum, not much folded: this\r\nname is given to it, because it never retains what it has received; but\r\nimmediately transmits it into the lower parts. Next to this, is the\r\nsmaller intestine, very much folded into sinuses: each of whose rings\r\nare by small membranes connected with the more internal, which being\r\nturned toward the right side, and ending at the right hip, yet fill\r\nmore the superior parts. Then this intestine is joined with another\r\nthicker, and running across; which beginning on the right side, towards\r\nthe left is open and long; to the right is not so; and therefore it\r\nis called cæcum. But that, which is open, is of large compass and\r\nsinuous, and less nervous than the former intestines, on both sides\r\nrolled different ways, but occupying more of the left and lower parts,\r\nit touches the liver and stomach: then it is joined with some small\r\nmembranes, that come from the right kidney; and there turning to the\r\nright, it is directed downward, where it discharges the excrements: and\r\ntherefore at that place it takes the name of the intestinum rectum.\r\nAll these parts are covered by the omentum, which on the lower part\r\nis smooth and contracted, and on the upper softer. Fat also grows to\r\nit, which like the brain and marrow is insensible. From each kidney\r\nproceeds a tube of a white colour to the bladder; the Greeks call them\r\nureteres[BZ], because by them they believe the urine to be distilled\r\ninto the bladder. The bladder in its sinus is nervous and double; in\r\nthe neck full and fleshy, and joined by veins to the intestine and\r\nto that bone, which is under the pubes: itself is loose, and more at\r\nliberty. It is differently placed in men and in women: for in men it\r\nis close to the intestine rectum, rather inclined to the left side: in\r\nwomen it is situated above their genital parts, and as it hangs, is\r\nsustained by the womb. Then in men the passage of the urine is extended\r\nlonger and narrower from its neck to the penis: in women it is shorter,\r\nand wider, and shows itself above the neck of the womb. Now the womb in\r\nvirgins is very small: in women, when not pregnant, not much larger,\r\nthan to be held in the hand. It begins with a straight and small neck,\r\nwhich is called the vagina[CA], in a line with the middle of the belly,\r\nthen is turned a little to the right hip; then mounting above the\r\nintestine rectum, its sides are connected to the ilia of the woman. The\r\nilia are situated betwixt the hips and pubes in the lower belly. From\r\nwhich and the pubes the abdomen reaches upwards to the præcordia; on\r\nthe external side the skin appears; on the inside it is lined by a thin\r\nmembrane, which is joined to the omentum, and is called by the Greeks\r\nperitonæum[CB].\r\n\r\n  [BW] σφαγίτιδες.\r\n\r\n  [BX] χαρωτίδες.\r\n\r\n  [BY] πυλωρὸς.\r\n\r\n  [BZ] οὐρητ̃ηρες.\r\n\r\n  [CA] _Canalis_ is our author’s word.\r\n\r\n  [CB] περιτόναιος.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. II.\r\n\r\nOF THE DISORDERS OF THE HEAD, AND THEIR CURE.\r\n\r\n\r\nHaving as it were presented these parts to view, as far as it is\r\nnecessary for a physician to know them, I shall proceed to the remedies\r\nof the disorders of each, beginning with the head: under which name\r\nI now intend that part, which is covered with hair: for pains of the\r\neyes, ears, and teeth, and such like, will be treated of elsewhere.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Of pains of the head, and a hydrocephalus._]\r\n\r\nNow in the head there is sometimes an acute and dangerous distemper,\r\nwhich the Greeks call cephalæa[CC]. The marks of which are a strong\r\nshuddering, relaxation of the nerves(4), dimness of the eyes,\r\ndelirium, vomiting, and withal a suppression of the voice; or an\r\nhæmorrhage from the nose, and with that a coldness of the body, and\r\nfainting; besides these an intolerable pain, especially about the\r\ntemples, or occiput. Sometimes too there is a long weakness of the\r\nhead, but neither severe nor dangerous, through the whole life.\r\nSometimes the pain is more violent, but short, yet not fatal; which is\r\ncontracted either by drinking wine, or crudity, or cold, or heat of a\r\nfire or the sun. And all these pains are sometimes accompanied with a\r\nfever, and sometimes not: sometimes they afflict the whole head, at\r\nother times a part of it; sometimes the pain extends to a contiguous\r\npart of the face. Besides these there occurs another disorder, which\r\nmay continue long: where a humour inflates the skin, and it swells,\r\nand yields to the impression of the finger. This the Greeks call\r\nhydrocephalus[CD].\r\n\r\n  [CC] κεφαλαία.\r\n\r\n  [CD] ὑδροκέφαλος.\r\n\r\nI have already spoken of the treatment of the second of these kinds,\r\nwhile it is slight, where I laid down rules to be observed by men in\r\nhealth, troubled with a weakness in any part. What remedies also are\r\nproper, when the pain is attended with a fever, has been shewn in that\r\nplace, where the cure of fevers was considered. Now I shall treat of\r\nthe rest.\r\n\r\nThat, which is acute, and that, which rises to an unusual height, and\r\nthat, which proceeds from some sudden cause, and though not mortal, yet\r\nis very violent, demands venesection for the first step in the cure.\r\nBut unless the pain be intolerable, that is needless. And it is better\r\nto abstain from food; if possible, from drink too; if not, to drink\r\nwater. If the pain continues the following day, to give a clyster, to\r\nprocure sneezings, to take nothing but water: for this discipline often\r\nremoves it in a day or two, especially if the origin be from wine, or\r\ncrudity.\r\n\r\nBut if these methods afford small relief, it is proper to clip the hair\r\nclose to the skin: then it must be considered, what was the cause of\r\nthe pain. If heat, it is expedient to pour a great quantity of cold\r\nwater over the head, to apply a concave sponge frequently dipped in\r\ncold water and squeezed, to anoint with rose-oil and vinegar, or rather\r\nto apply sordid wool dipped in these, or some other cooling cataplasms.\r\nBut if cold has brought on the disorder, it is proper to pour upon the\r\nhead sea water, or at least salt water warm, or a decoction of laurel;\r\nthen to rub the head briskly; next to embrocate it with warm oil, and\r\nto cover it. Some even bind it up; others clap on cervicalia(5) and\r\ncloaths, and thus are relieved; others are assisted by hot cataplasms.\r\nAnd therefore, where the cause is not known, it is proper to try,\r\nwhether cooling things, or heating give most relief, and to use those,\r\nwhich upon experiment shall be found best.\r\n\r\nBut if the cause cannot be discovered, it is proper to pour over the\r\nhead first warm water, as has been prescribed, or salt water, or a\r\ndecoction of laurel, then cold vinegar and water. The following methods\r\nare of general use in all inveterate pains of the head: to excite\r\nsneezings, to rub the lower parts briskly, to use gargarisms of such\r\nthings as promote saliva, to apply cucurbitals to the temples and back\r\nof the head, to sollicit an hæmorrhage from the nose, to vellicate the\r\ntemples now and then with resin, and by applying mustard to ulcerate\r\nthose parts, that are affected, first putting linen below, that it may\r\nnot corrode too severely, or to make ulcers where the pain is, by hot\r\nirons, to eat always moderately, and drink water; when the pain is\r\nabated, to go into the bath, there to pour over the head first a great\r\nquantity of hot water, and then cold. If the pain is wholly removed, to\r\nreturn even to the use of wine; but ever after to drink water before\r\nany thing else.\r\n\r\nThat kind is different, where a humour is collected within the head.\r\nIn this it is necessary to clip to the skin; then to apply mustard, so\r\nas to ulcerate it; if that does not prove effectual, the knife must\r\nbe made use of. The management must be so far the same with dropsical\r\ncases, that the patient must be exercised, sweated, briskly rubbed, and\r\ntake such food and drink, as are powerful diureticks.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Of the cynicus spasmus._]\r\n\r\nThere is a distemper incident to the face, which the Greeks call\r\ncynicus spasmus[CE]. It comes on an acute fever. The mouth is turned\r\naside with a kind of grin, and therefore it is nothing else than a\r\ndistortion of the mouth. There is also a frequent change of colour in\r\nthe face and the whole body, and a great propensity to sleep.\r\n\r\n  [CE] κυνικὸς σπασμὸς.\r\n\r\nIt is very proper to let blood in this disorder. If it is not removed\r\nby this, to give a clyster. If it does not yield even to that, to\r\nvomit by white hellebore. Besides it is necessary to avoid the heat of\r\nthe sun, fatigue, and wine. But if it is not cured by these methods,\r\nrunning must be used, and gentle and long friction upon that part,\r\nwhich is diseased; in the other parts shorter, but brisk. It does\r\nservice also to procure sneezings, to shave the head, and to pour upon\r\nit hot, either sea water, or at least salt water, with sulphur added\r\nto it: after this bathing, to rub again, to chew mustard, and at the\r\nsame time to apply cerate to the parts of the face that are affected,\r\nand to the sound parts mustard, till it corrode them. The most proper\r\ndiet is of the middle kind.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Of a palsy of the tongue._]\r\n\r\nBut if the tongue be paralytick, which sometimes happens of itself,\r\nsometimes is occasioned by distemper, so that the pronunciation is\r\nindistinct; it is necessary to use a gargarism of a decoction of thyme,\r\nor hyssop, or catmint; to drink water; to rub briskly the head, mouth,\r\nand the parts under the chin, and the neck; to rub the tongue itself\r\nwith laser; to chew the most acrid things, such as mustard, garlick,\r\nonion; to make strong efforts to articulate words clearly; to take\r\nexercise, keeping in the breath; to pour cold water upon the head\r\noften; sometimes to eat plentifully of radishes, and then to vomit.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Of a catarrh and gravedo._]\r\n\r\nA humour distils from the head sometimes into the nose, which is a\r\nslight disorder; sometimes upon the fauces, which is worse; sometimes\r\neven upon the lungs, which is worst of all. If it have fallen upon\r\nthe nose, a thin rheum flows from the nostrils, the head is slightly\r\npained, a weight is felt in it, and there are frequent sneezings. If\r\nupon the fauces, it irritates them, and raises a slight cough. If upon\r\nthe lungs, beside the sneezings and cough, there is also a weight in\r\nthe head, lassitude, thirst, heat, and bilious urine.\r\n\r\nAnother (though not very different) disorder is a gravedo. This\r\nobstructs the nostrils, blunts the voice, raises a dry cough: at the\r\nsame time the saliva is salt, there is a sounding in the ears, the\r\nveins of the head move, and the urine is turbid. All these disorders\r\nHippocrates calls coryzæ[CF]. I observe that this is now by the\r\nGreeks appropriated to the gravedo: and catarrhs are called by them\r\ncatastagmi[CG]. These are common, and of short continuance; but if they\r\nbe neglected, are usually lasting. None of them is dangerous, but such\r\nas ulcerate the lungs.\r\n\r\n  [CF] κορύζαι.\r\n\r\n  [CG] κατασταγμοὶ.\r\n\r\nWhen we perceive any such symptoms, we ought immediately to avoid the\r\nheat of the sun, the bath, and venery(6). And at the same time\r\nnevertheless unction may be used, and the ordinary diet. The patient\r\nshould take a straight, but not too quick walk; and after it the head\r\nand face must be rubbed above fifty times. And it seldom happens,\r\nif we have restricted ourselves for two days or three at most, that\r\nthe disorder is not mitigated. When it is abated, if in the catarrh\r\nthe phlegm turns thicker, or in a gravedo, if the nostrils are more\r\nopen(7), the bath is to be used, and the face and head fomented\r\nplentifully first with hot water, and then with egelid; after that,\r\nthe patient may eat heartily and drink wine. But if on the fourth day\r\nthe phlegm is equally thin, or the nostrils appear equally obstructed,\r\naustere Arminæan wine(8) is to be taken; then again for two days\r\nsuccessively water; after which the person may return to the bath, and\r\nhis usual way of living.\r\n\r\nNeither even on these days, in which some things are to be refrained,\r\nis it proper to live like sick people; but in all other respects the\r\nsame liberties may be taken as in health, except by one, who uses to\r\nbe long and severely afflicted with these disorders; for such a person\r\nrequires a management somewhat nicer. Therefore if the defluxion be\r\nupon his nose or fauces, besides what I mentioned before, he ought\r\nimmediately in the first days of his indisposition to walk much, to\r\nrub the inferior parts briskly, the friction must be more gentle upon\r\nthe thorax, and gentler still upon the head, the ordinary diet must be\r\ndiminished to half the quantity, eggs must be used, starch, and such\r\nlike things, which generate a thicker phlegm; thirst, as much as he\r\ncan bear, must be one part of the cure. When by these means one has\r\nbeen rendered fit for the bath, and has used it, a small fish, or flesh\r\nis to be added to his diet; with this caution however, that he do not\r\nimmediately take his ordinary quantity of victuals. Pure wine must be\r\nused pretty plentifully.\r\n\r\nBut if it distils also upon the lungs, there is a much greater\r\nnecessity for walking and friction, still observing the same rules in\r\ndiet. If these have not the desired effect, he must use the more acrid\r\nkinds, indulge sleep more, and abstain from all business, sometimes try\r\nthe bath, but not soon.\r\n\r\nIn a gravedo it is necessary for the first day to rest, neither to eat\r\nnor drink, to cover the head, and put wool round the throat; the day\r\nfollowing to rise, to abstain long from drinking, or if he is obliged\r\nto do it, not to take above a hemina of water; on the third day to\r\ntake a little soft bread with a small fish or some light flesh, and to\r\ndrink water. If a person should not be able to forbear eating heartily,\r\nhe must vomit: when he comes into the bath, he is to foment his head\r\nand face plentifully with warm water, till he sweat, then return to\r\nthe use of wine. After which it can scarcely happen, that the same\r\nindisposition will continue. But if it remain, use must be made of\r\ncold, dry, and light food, as little moisture as possible, friction\r\nand exercise being still continued, which are necessary in every\r\nindisposition of this nature.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. III.\r\n\r\nOF THE DISEASES OF THE NECK, AND THEIR CURE.\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom the head we proceed to the neck, which is liable to very severe\r\ndiseases. Nor is there a more troublesome or more acute distemper than\r\nthat, which by a kind of spasm of the nerves draws sometimes the head\r\nto the shoulders, sometimes the chin to the breast, sometimes stretches\r\nthe neck _and holds it_ straight and immoveable. The first the Greeks\r\ncall opisthotonus[CH], the second emprosthotonus[CI], and the last\r\ntetanus[CJ], although some with less accuracy make use of these names\r\nindiscriminately. They often kill within four days: if the patients\r\nhave escaped that time, they are out of danger.\r\n\r\n  [CH] ὀπισθότονος.\r\n\r\n  [CI] ἐμπροσθότονος.\r\n\r\n  [CJ] τέτανος.\r\n\r\nAll these are cured by the same method; so far physicians agree. But\r\nAsclepiades believed, that blood should be let: some again affirmed\r\nthat ought by all means to be avoided: for this reason, that the body\r\nthen stood most in need of heat; and that this resides in the blood of\r\nthe veins. This indeed is false. For it is not the nature of the blood\r\nto be peculiarly hot; but amongst the several things, which compose the\r\nhuman body, it most quickly grows either hot or cold. Whether or no it\r\nbe proper to make this discharge, may be understood from the general\r\ndirections, which were given about bleeding. But it is evidently\r\nproper to give castor, and with it pepper or laser. Then a moist and\r\nhot fomentation is needful. Therefore most physicians pour warm water\r\nfrequently upon the neck. That relieves for the present; but renders\r\nthe nerves more liable to cold, which is to be particularly avoided.\r\n\r\nIt is more proper then first to anoint the neck over with liquid\r\ncerate(9): next to apply ox-bladders or bottles filled with hot oil,\r\nor a hot cataplasm made of meal, or pepper bruised with a fig. But it\r\nis most suitable to foment with moist salt; the manner of doing which I\r\nhave already shewn. When any of these has been done, it is fit to bring\r\nthe patient to the fire, or if it be the summer-time to the sun; and to\r\nrub his neck, and shoulders, and spine with old oil, which is fittest\r\nfor that purpose; if that cannot be had, with Syrian(10); if that\r\ncannot be got neither, with the oldest fat.\r\n\r\nAs friction is serviceable to all the vertebræ, so it is particularly\r\nto those of the neck. Wherefore day and night, but at proper intervals,\r\nthis remedy must be used. When it is intermitted, some heating malagma\r\nmust be applied. And cold is of all things to be avoided. And upon\r\nthat account there ought to be a constant fire in the chamber, where\r\nthe patient is nursed, and especially in the morning before day-light,\r\nwhen the cold is most intense. Neither will it be improper to keep\r\nthe head close clipped, and to moisten it with hot ointment of iris,\r\nor the cyprine, and to keep it covered with a cap; sometimes to dip\r\nthe whole body in warm oil, or in a warm decoction of fenugreek, with\r\nthe addition of a third part of oil. A clyster also often relaxes the\r\nsuperior parts.\r\n\r\nBut if notwithstanding the pain has grown more severe, cucurbitals are\r\nto be applied to the neck, and an incision made in the skin. Eschars\r\nare to be made either by irons, or mustard. When the pain has abated,\r\nand the neck has begun to move, we may know, that the disease yields to\r\nthe remedies. But all food that requires chewing must be long avoided.\r\nGruels must be used, also sorbile eggs, or broth made of chickens, or\r\nsome other tender flesh. If this has succeeded, and the neck shall\r\nappear to be entirely well, we must begin with pulse or intrita well\r\nmoistened. But the patient may sooner venture to chew bread than taste\r\nwine; for the use of this is very dangerous, and therefore to be\r\ndeferred for a longer time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. IV.\r\n\r\nOF THE DISEASES IN THE FAUCES, AND THEIR CURE.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs the former kind of distemper afflicts the whole neck, so there is\r\nanother common one equally dangerous and acute, the seat of which is\r\nin the fauces. Our authors call it angina: amongst the Greeks the name\r\nvaries according to the species. For sometimes there appears neither\r\nany redness nor tumour; but the body is dry, the breath is fetched with\r\ndifficulty, the limbs are relaxed. This they call [CK]synanche(11).\r\nSometimes the tongue and fauces are red and swelled, the voice is\r\nstopped, the eyes are turned, the face is pale, and there is a\r\nhiccough. That is called quasi synanche[CL]. These symptoms are common\r\nto both: the patient is not able to swallow either food or drink;\r\nhis breathing is obstructed. It is more slight, when there is only a\r\nswelling and redness, and the rest of the symptoms do not follow. That\r\nthey call parasynanche[CM].\r\n\r\n  [CK] συνάγχη.\r\n\r\n  [CL] ὡς συνάγχη.\r\n\r\n  [CM] παρασυνάγχη.\r\n\r\nWhatever species it be, if the patient’s strength will allow, blood\r\nmust be let, although there is not a plethora; the next thing is to\r\ngive a clyster. A cucurbital also is properly applied below the chin,\r\nand about the fauces, in order to evacuate the suffocating matter.\r\nThen there is a necessity for moist fomentations. For dry ones cut\r\nthe breath. Therefore it is fit to apply sponges, which are better\r\ndipped now and then in warm oil, than in warm water. And it is of\r\ngreat efficacy in this case too, to put on salt in warm bags. Then it\r\nis convenient to make a decoction of hyssop, or cat mint, or thyme,\r\nor wormwood, or even bran, or dry figs, in hydromel, and use it as a\r\ngargarism; after that to touch the palate either with ox-gall, or the\r\nmedicine, which is composed of mulberries. Fine flour of pepper is also\r\nproper to sprinkle upon it.\r\n\r\nIf from these things there is little benefit, the last remedy is to\r\nmake pretty deep incisions under the jaws above the neck, and in the\r\npalate about the uvula, or to open the veins, that lie under the\r\ntongue, that the distemper may be discharged through these wounds. If\r\nthis method don’t relieve the patient, we may be assured, that the\r\ndistemper has got the better of him. But if the disorder is mitigated\r\nby them, and his throat is capable of admitting meat and drink, health\r\nwill be easily recovered again. And sometimes nature assists too, if\r\nthe disorder passes from a more contracted place to a larger. For this\r\nreason, when a redness and swelling begins in the præcordia, it is a\r\nsign that the malady has begun to leave the throat.\r\n\r\nWhatever has relieved it, he must begin with a moist diet, and\r\nespecially hydromel; then take soft food, and not acrid, till the\r\nfauces return to their former soundness. It is a vulgar opinion,\r\nthat if a person eats a young swallow, he will be in no danger of an\r\nangina for the whole year: and that if it be preserved in salt, to\r\nburn it, and powder the coal of it, and give it to drink in hydromel,\r\ndoes service in this distemper. And as this is confidently reported\r\nby men of good credit among the common people, and the practice can\r\nbe attended with no danger, although I have not read of it in medical\r\ntreatises, yet I thought fit to give it a place in this work.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Of a difficulty of breathing._]\r\n\r\nThere is also a disorder about the fauces, which amongst the Greeks has\r\ndifferent names, according to its different degrees. The whole consists\r\nin a difficulty of breathing: but while it is moderate, and does not\r\nwholly suffocate, it is called dyspnœa[CN]; when it is more severe,\r\nthat the patient cannot breath without a noise, and quick fetches,\r\nasthma[CO]; when the difficulty is so great, that respiration cannot\r\nbe performed, unless the neck be kept erect, orthopnœa[CP]. The first\r\nof these may be of long continuance without endangering life: the two\r\nfollowing are commonly acute. These symptoms are common to them all,\r\nthat by the straitness of the passage, through which the breath comes,\r\na wheezing is occasioned; there is a pain in the breast and præcordia,\r\nsometimes also in the shoulders, and that goes and comes; besides these\r\nthere is a slight cough.\r\n\r\n  [CN] δύσπνοια.\r\n\r\n  [CO] ̃ἀσθμα.\r\n\r\n  [CP] ὀρθόπνοια.\r\n\r\nNow the remedy, unless there be some contra-indication, is letting\r\nof blood. Nor is that sufficient; but goat’s milk must be given warm\r\nto the patient fasting, and if he has no fever, his belly must be\r\nopened(12); and sometimes purged; and sometimes a clyster must be\r\ngiven, by which means the body being extenuated, the patient begins to\r\nbreathe more freely. The head also ought to be placed high on the bed,\r\nand the thorax assisted with fomentations, and hot cataplasms, either\r\ndry or moist; and after that a malagma applied, or a cerate of the\r\ncyprine ointment, or that of iris. Then the patient must drink fasting\r\neither hydromel, or a decoction of hyssop, or bruised caper-roots\r\nin water. It is proper also to give nitre, or cresses, or garlick,\r\ntoasted, and then ground and mixed with honey: _another medicine is\r\nthus prepared_, honey, galbanum, resin, and turpentine are boiled up\r\ntogether: and when they have come to a consistence, the bigness of\r\na bean is put every day in the mouth, and suffered to lie under the\r\ntongue, till it be dissolved: or p. *. & a quadrans of crude sulphur,\r\nand p. *. of southernwood are powdered, and mixed in a cyathus of wine,\r\nand that is supped warm. And it is not an idle opinion, that a fox’s\r\nliver dried ought to be beat, and the powder of it sprinkled upon the\r\ndrink; or that the lungs of the same animal should be eaten roasted as\r\nsoon as possible after he is killed, but nothing of iron _used in the\r\ndressing_. Besides these, gruels and light food must be used, sometimes\r\nalso small austere wine, and sometimes a vomit taken. Whatever is\r\ndiuretic, is also good; but nothing more so, than walking slowly almost\r\nto lassitude, much friction, especially of the lower parts, either in\r\nthe sun or at the fire, and both by the patient himself and by others,\r\ntill he sweat.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Of an ulcer in the fauces._]\r\n\r\nIn the internal part of the fauces there sometimes happens an\r\nexulceration. In this case most people make use of hot cataplasms\r\nexternally, and moist fomentations. They advise also the warm vapour to\r\nbe received by the mouth: by which, others say these parts are rendered\r\nsofter, and more fit to afford entertainment to the disorder, that\r\nalready possesses them. But if the distemper can be prevented by these\r\nmethods, those remedies are safe: if there is reason to fear _it is\r\nalready begun_, they are improper. It is undoubtedly dangerous to rub\r\nthe fauces, for it ulcerates them. Neither are diuretics good: because\r\nas they pass, they may possibly attenuate the phlegm of the part\r\naffected, which it is better to repel.\r\n\r\nAsclepiades, to whom we are indebted for many useful discoveries, in\r\nwhich I have also followed him, recommends the sipping of very strong\r\nvinegar, and asserts, that this without any danger suppresses the\r\nulcers. That may possibly prevent a flux of blood, but cannot heal\r\nthe ulcers. A more proper application is lycium(13), which the same\r\nauthor also equally approves; or the juice of leek, or horehound,\r\nor sweet almonds rubbed with tragacanth, and mixed with passum, or\r\nlint-seed bruised, and mixed with sweet wine. The exercise also of\r\nwalking and running is necessary. And smart friction is to be used from\r\nthe breast downwards to all the inferior parts.\r\n\r\nThe food ought to be neither too acrid, nor rough: honey, lentils,\r\ntragum, milk, ptisan, fat flesh, and especially leeks, and whatever is\r\nmixed with the latter. The drink ought to be as little as possible,\r\nwater may be given, either pure, or boiled to a decoction with a quince\r\nor dates. Also mild gargarisms: but if these are not successful,\r\nrepellent ones are good.\r\n\r\nThis disease is not acute, and yet may not continue long: but requires\r\na speedy cure, lest it turn very severe and tedious.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Of a cough._]\r\n\r\nA cough, which is contracted in many different ways, is generally a\r\ntroublesome concomitant of an exulceration of the fauces; and in this\r\ncase, when the fauces are cured, the cough ceases. Yet it is sometimes\r\nfound by itself without any other distemper: and when it becomes\r\ninveterate, it is hardly possible to remove it entirely. And sometimes\r\nit is dry, sometimes it either generates or discharges phlegm.\r\n\r\nIn this it is proper to drink hyssop every other day; to keep in the\r\nbreath and run, but by no means in dusty places; and to read aloud,\r\nwhich at first is obstructed by the cough, but afterwards overcomes it;\r\nthen to walk; then to use also those exercises that employ the hands,\r\nand to rub the breast for a long time: after these to eat three ounces\r\nof the mellowest figs stewed over the fire.\r\n\r\nBesides if it be moist, strong frictions are good with some heating\r\nmedicines, the head being briskly rubbed at the same time; also\r\ncucurbitals used to the breast, mustard applied to the external part of\r\nthe fauces, till it be a little ulcerated; the drink may be prepared\r\nfrom mint, and sweet almonds, and starch; and beginning with dry bread\r\nhe may proceed to any other light food.\r\n\r\nBut if it be a dry cough, when it is most severe, taking a cyathus of\r\naustere wine relieves; provided that be not oftener done than three or\r\nfour times after proper intervals. It is likewise necessary to swallow\r\na little of the best laser, to take the juice of leeks or horehound, to\r\nlick squils, to sup vinegar of squills, or at least sharp vinegar, or\r\ntwo cyathi of wine with a clove of bruised garlick infused in it.\r\n\r\nIn every cough it does service to take journies, long voyages, and to\r\nlive near the sea, and to swim. The diet must be sometimes soft, as\r\nmallows and nettles; sometimes acrid, as milk boiled with garlick;\r\ngruels, to which laser has been added, or such as have had leeks boiled\r\nin them, till they have lost all their verdure. A sorbile egg also with\r\nan addition of sulphur may be supped; for drink warm water may be taken\r\nfirst, then alternately, some days water, and other days wine.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Of a spitting of blood._]\r\n\r\nA spitting of blood may strike a greater terror. But that sometimes\r\nis less, and sometimes more dangerous. For it issues sometimes from\r\nthe gums, sometimes from the mouth; and indeed from the latter very\r\nplentifully at times, but without a cough, without an ulcer, or any\r\ndistemper of the gums, and without expectorating any thing; but breaks\r\nout from the mouth in the same manner, as from the nose. And sometimes\r\npure blood is discharged, at other times something like water, in which\r\nfresh meat has been washed. Sometimes it comes from the upper part\r\nof the fauces, which may happen by means of an exulceration in that\r\npart; or when it is not ulcerated, either from the mouth of some vein\r\nopened, or tubercles rising there, and discharging the blood. When\r\nthis is the case, neither meat nor drink do harm, nor is any thing\r\nexpectorated, as from an ulcer. But sometimes, when the throat and\r\nwind-pipe are ulcerated, a frequent cough forces out blood too. Neither\r\nis it uncommon for it to come either from the lungs, or the breast,\r\nor the side, or the liver. Women, whose menses are suppressed, often\r\nhave these spittings. And medical writers say, that blood is discharged\r\neither by the erosion, or the rupture of some part, or the dilatation\r\nof the mouth of some vein. The first they call diabrosis[CQ], the\r\nsecond rhegmochasmus[CR], the third anastomosis[CS]. The last does\r\nleast hurt; the first is most dangerous. And it often happens, that the\r\nblood is followed by pus.\r\n\r\n  [CQ] διάβρωσις.\r\n\r\n  [CR] ῥηγμοχασμὸς.\r\n\r\n  [CS] ἀναστόμωσις.\r\n\r\nNow sometimes stopping the blood is alone sufficient to effect a cure.\r\nBut if ulcers have followed, if pus, if there be a cough, diseases\r\nare formed, which differ in nature and danger according to the parts\r\nthey possess. If blood only is discharged, both the remedy is easier,\r\nand the termination of the distemper quicker. And we ought not to be\r\nignorant, that a moderate discharge of blood, is not hurtful to those,\r\nwho are accustomed to hæmorrhages, or such, whose spine or hips are\r\npained, or to any after violent walking or running, provided there\r\nbe no fever: and that passing off in the urine, it removes even the\r\nlassitude. And that it is not terrible in the case of a person, who has\r\nfallen from a height, if nothing else appears uncommon in his urine.\r\nThat neither is a vomiting of blood dangerous, although it return,\r\nif opportunity has been allowed to strengthen and fill up the body\r\nbeforehand: and in general that no such discharge can hurt, when it\r\nhappens in a strong body, and is neither excessive, nor raises a cough,\r\nnor heat. These observations are universal. Now I shall return to those\r\nparticular places, which I have mentioned.\r\n\r\nIf it comes from the gums, it is sufficient to chew purslane; if from\r\nthe mouth, to hold pure wine in it; if that is not effectual, vinegar.\r\nIf notwithstanding these it breaks out with violence, because it may\r\nwaste a person, it is most proper to divert its force by applying a\r\ncucurbital to the back of the head, and making an incision in the skin;\r\nif this happens to a woman, whose menses are stopped, to apply the\r\ncucurbital to her groin, with scarification.\r\n\r\nBut if it has proceeded from the fauces, or the more internal parts,\r\nthere is more to be feared, and greater care must be taken in the\r\ncure. Blood must be let: and if notwithstanding that, it breaks\r\nout from the mouth, the operation must be repeated a second, and a\r\nthird time, and every day a little taken away: the patient ought\r\nimmediately to sup either vinegar, or the juice of plantain, or leek\r\nwith frankincense(14): and some sordid wool dipped in vinegar\r\nand squeezed, should be applied externally upon the place, which\r\nis diseased, and it must be cooled now and then with a sponge.\r\nErasistratus made many ligatures in the legs, and thighs, and arms of\r\nsuch patients. Asclepiades was so far from thinking this useful, that\r\nhe even judged it hurtful. But a number of experiments gives proof of\r\nits often answering very well.\r\n\r\nNevertheless there is not a necessity for making ligatures in many\r\nplaces: but it is sufficient to do it below the groin, and above the\r\nancles, and near the top of the shoulders, and fore arms. Then if\r\nthe patient have a fever, gruel must be given; and for drink some\r\nastringent decoction. But if there is no fever, either washed alica,\r\nor bread dipped in cold water, and a soft egg too may be given; and\r\nfor drink either what was above-mentioned, or sweet wine, or cold\r\nwater. But in the allowance of drink we must remember, that thirst is\r\nserviceable in this disorder.\r\n\r\nBesides these, rest, security from apprehensions, and silence are\r\nnecessary. The patient’s head, when he lies, should also be high, and\r\nit is proper to clip it close. The face is to be often bathed with cold\r\nwater. But wine, the bath, venery, oil amongst meat, all acrid things,\r\nwarm fomentations, a hot and close room, many cloaths thrown upon the\r\nbody, are all prejudicial; also frictions, unless when bleedings have\r\nentirely ceased. Then indeed he may begin with the arms and legs, but\r\nnot touch the chest. In this case he should reside near the sea-coast\r\nin the winter time, and in the inland places in the summer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. V.\r\n\r\nOF THE DISORDERS OF THE STOMACH, AND THEIR CURE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe stomach(15) is below the fauces; to this many tedious disorders\r\nare incident. For sometimes a great heat affects it, sometimes a\r\nflatulency, or an inflammation, or an exulceration; at other times\r\nphlegm or bile attacks it. But the most frequent disease is a\r\nrelaxation: nor is there any thing from which the stomach either\r\nsuffers more itself, or more affects the whole frame.\r\n\r\nAs its disorders are different, so are the remedies. Where it is\r\ndistressed with heat, it must be embrocated now and then with vinegar\r\nand rose oil, and a powder(16) with oil applied, and such cataplasms\r\nas at the same time both repel and soften. Cold water may be given to\r\ndrink, unless there be some particular reason against it.\r\n\r\nWhen there is a flatulency, the application of cucurbitals does\r\nservice, and there is no necessity for scarification. Dry and warm\r\nfomentations, but not very strong, are serviceable. Abstinence must\r\nbe enjoined at times. To drink wormwood, or hyssop, or rue fasting\r\nis good. Exercise must be used, at first gentle, and afterwards\r\nstronger; especially such as may move the superior parts, which kind\r\nis most proper in all disorders of the stomach. Exercise should be\r\nfollowed by unction and friction; also the bath sometimes, but seldom,\r\nand sometimes clysters; after these warm food, and not flatulent;\r\nand in the same manner warm drink, first water, afterwards when the\r\ninflation has subsided, austere wine. This rule must be laid down in\r\nall distempers of the stomach, that by whatever means any patient has\r\nbeen recovered, he must pursue the same method when he is well: for his\r\nweakness returns, unless health be preserved by the same regimen, by\r\nwhich it was restored.\r\n\r\nBut if there be any inflammation, which is commonly followed by a\r\nswelling and pain, the chief remedies are, rest, and abstinence,\r\nsulphurated wool(17) applied round it, the use of wormwood fasting.\r\nIf there is a burning heat in the stomach, it must be embrocated\r\nnow and then with vinegar and rose-oil; and then food must be taken\r\nsparingly; and the external applications must be such, as both repel\r\nand soften; then withdrawing these, warm cataplasms of meal must be\r\nused, to discuss the remains of it; a clyster must be given now and\r\nthen; exercise must be used, and a fuller diet.\r\n\r\nBut if the stomach is infested with an ulcer, the same course almost\r\nmust be pursued, as has been prescribed in ulcerated fauces. Exercise\r\nand friction of the lower parts must be practised. Light and glutinous\r\nfood must be used, but not to satiety. Every thing acrid and acid is to\r\nbe avoided. If there is no fever, sweet wine may be used, or if that\r\ninflates, at least mild; but neither very cold, nor too hot.\r\n\r\nIf the stomach is loaded with phlegm, a vomit is necessary, sometimes\r\nfasting, sometimes after meat. Exercise, gestation, sailing, friction,\r\nare good. Nothing is to be eaten or drunk, but what is warm; only\r\navoiding such things, as usually generate phlegm.\r\n\r\nIt is a more troublesome disorder, where the stomach is vitiated with\r\nbile. Those that are thus affected, usually at the interval of some\r\ndays throw it up, and indeed, which is worst of all, of a black colour.\r\nIt is proper to give such patients clysters, and potions of wormwood;\r\ngestation, and sailing are necessary, and vomiting by sea sickness,\r\nif it can be procured; crudity must be avoided; food used easy of\r\nconcoction, and not ungrateful to the stomach, and austere wine.\r\n\r\nThe most common and worst disorder of the stomach is a relaxation,\r\nthat is, when it is not capable of retaining food, and the body ceases\r\nto be nourished, and thus is wasted by a consumption. The bath is\r\nvery hurtful in this species. Reading, and exercising of the superior\r\nparts are necessary, also unctions and frictions; then to have cold\r\nwater poured all over the body, and to swim in cold water, and to\r\nlay the stomach itself under canals, and more especially that part\r\nbelow the shoulders, which is opposite to the stomach; to stand in\r\ncold and medicinal springs is a salutary practice, such as those of\r\nCutiliæ(18) and Subruinæ; food is also to be used cold, and such\r\nrather, as is of difficult concoction than what is easily corrupted:\r\nfor this reason most people, that can concoct nothing else, concoct\r\nbeef. Whence we may infer, that neither birds, nor venison, nor fish\r\nought to be given, except the harder kinds. Cold wine indeed is fittest\r\nto drink, or at least the strong well warmed, particularly the Rhetic\r\nor Allobrogic(19), or any other, which is both austere, and seasoned\r\nwith resin; if that is not to be had, the roughest possible, and\r\nespecially Signine(20).\r\n\r\nIf the food does not stay upon the stomach, water is to be drunk, and\r\na plentiful vomiting procured; and food must be given a second time,\r\nand then cucurbitals are to be applied two fingers breadth below the\r\nstomach, and kept there for two or three hours. If there is both a\r\nvomiting and pain at the same time, sordid wool, or sponge dipped in\r\nvinegar, or a cooling cataplasm, must be applied to the stomach. The\r\narms and legs must be rubbed briskly, but not long, and heated.\r\n\r\nIf the pain is more severe, the cupping must be performed four fingers\r\nbelow the præcordia; bread dipped in cold vinegar and water must be\r\ngiven immediately; if it has not staid, then after the vomiting,\r\nsome light thing not ungrateful to the stomach; if even that is not\r\nretained, a cyathus of wine every hour, till the stomach be settled.\r\nThe juice of radishes is also a powerful medicine; but a stronger is\r\nthe juice of the acid pomegranate, with an equal quantity of the juice\r\nof the sweet pomegranate, and an addition also of the juice of endive\r\nand mint, but the least proportion of this; with which it is very\r\nproper to mix as much cold water, as equals the quantity of them all\r\ntogether. For that is more efficacious for composing the stomach than\r\nwine. A vomiting, which comes of itself, is to be stopped, although\r\nthere be a nausea.\r\n\r\nBut if the food has grown sour or putrid within the stomach, both which\r\naccidents are known by the eructations, it must be evacuated; and the\r\nstomach must be immediately recruited by taking the same kind of food,\r\nthat I have just mentioned. When the present danger is removed, we must\r\nreturn to those things which have been prescribed before.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. VI.\r\n\r\nOF PAINS OF THE SIDES, AND THEIR CURE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe stomach is surrounded by the sides; and in these there happen\r\nsometimes violent pains. They arise either from cold, or a blow,\r\nor from excessive running, or from a distemper. But sometimes the\r\ndisorder goes no farther than a pain; which is sometimes slowly, and\r\nsometimes quickly removed. At other times it grows extremely dangerous;\r\nand there arises an acute distemper, which by the Greeks is called\r\npleuriticus[CT]. To this pain of the side is added a fever and cough:\r\nand by the last is expectorated, if the distemper be tolerable phlegm;\r\nif severe, blood. Sometimes also the cough is dry, and brings up\r\nnothing, and this is worse than the first, but more tolerable than the\r\nsecond.\r\n\r\n  [CT] πλευριτικὸς. Our author uses here the masculine adjective to\r\n  the Latin word _morbus_.\r\n\r\nNow the cure of a violent and recent pain is letting of blood. But\r\nif the case is more slight or of a longer standing, that remedy in\r\nthe first is needless, and for the other is too late; and recourse\r\nmust be had to cupping, first making an incision in the skin. Mustard\r\nwith vinegar is also proper to apply upon the breast, till it produce\r\nulcuscles and pimples; and after that, a medicine which can derive the\r\nhumour thither. Besides these it is fit first to put sulphurated wool\r\nround the side; and then when the inflammation has a little abated, to\r\nmake use of dry and warm fomentations. From these a transition is made\r\nto malagmas.\r\n\r\nIf an inveterate pain still continues, in the last place it is\r\ndiscussed by the application of resin. Warm food and drink must be\r\nused, and cold avoided. In the mean time, it is not amiss to rub the\r\nextremities with oil and sulphur: if the cough has abated to read\r\nsoftly: and by that time to take both acrid food and stronger wine.\r\nSuch then are the prescriptions of the physicians. But without these\r\nit is said, that our peasants find it sufficient for their cure to\r\ndrink germander in water.\r\n\r\nThese rules are common in every pain of the side: the cure is more\r\ndifficult, if the distemper has grown acute. In such a case, besides\r\nwhat has been already directed, these cautions are to be observed: that\r\nthe food be extremely thin and mild, especially gruel, and particularly\r\nthat, which is made of ptisan; or chicken broth with leeks, and that is\r\nnot to be given till the third day, and with this condition then, that\r\nthe strength will admit of it: and for the drink a decoction of hyssop,\r\nor rue in hydromel. Now the seasons for giving these will appear from\r\nthe consideration of the fevers increasing or abating, so that they be\r\ngiven in the greatest remission. At the same time however we should\r\nknow, that in a cough of this kind we are not to allow the fauces to be\r\ndry. For often, where there is nothing to be expectorated, it continues\r\nand suffocates: for which reason I said, that a cough, which evacuates\r\nnothing, was still worse than one, which brought up phlegm. But the\r\ndistemper itself in this case will not allow wine, which we prescribed\r\nbefore: instead of it the cream of ptisan is to be used.\r\n\r\nAs the patient is to be supported in the violence of the distemper by\r\nthese things; so when it has abated a little, a fuller diet and also\r\nsome wine may be allowed; provided nothing be given, which may either\r\nrefrigerate the body, or irritate the fauces. If the cough remains\r\nupon the recovery, it will be proper to intermit for one day, and the\r\nday after to take a little more wine with meat. But if the cough still\r\nprevails, it will not be amiss, as above directed, to drink some cyathi\r\nof wine. But in this kind of disorder sweet wine, or at least mild is\r\nmore proper. If it grows inveterate, the body must be strengthened by a\r\nrobust diet.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. VII.\r\n\r\nOF A PERIPNEUMONY, AND ITS CURE.\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom the frame of the body we must proceed to the bowels; and first\r\nof all to the lungs. Whence a violent and acute distemper arises,\r\nwhich the Greeks call peripneumonia[CU]. The nature of it is this. The\r\nwhole lungs are affected. And their disorder is followed by a cough\r\nbringing up bile, or pus, a weight of the præcordia and the whole\r\nbreast, difficulty of breathing, violent fevers, continual watching,\r\nprostration of appetite, and a consumption. This kind of distemper is\r\nattended with more danger than pain.\r\n\r\n  [CU] περιπνευμονία.\r\n\r\nIt is fit, if the strength will admit of it, to let blood: if not,\r\nto make use of dry cupping to the præcordia; and if the patient can\r\nendure it, by gestation to dissipate; if he cannot bear that, to move\r\nhim gently within the house; to give him in drink hyssop boiled with a\r\ndry fig; or a decoction of hyssop or rue in hydromel; to use friction\r\nlongest upon the shoulders, a little shorter on the arms, and feet, and\r\nlegs, gentle over the lungs, and to do this twice every day.\r\n\r\nAs to diet, he ought never to have salt things, nor acrid, nor bitters,\r\nnor astringents; but what is of the milder kind. Therefore at the\r\nbeginning is to be given gruel either of ptisan, or alica, or rice,\r\nin which recent fat has been boiled; along with it a sorbile egg,\r\npine-nuts, bread with honey, or washed alica with hydromel. After that,\r\nnot only pure water must be allowed to drink, but hydromel too egelid;\r\nor if it be the summer time, even cold; unless there be some particular\r\nreason against it. It is sufficient to give these every other day, when\r\nthe distemper is increasing.\r\n\r\nWhen it ceases to increase, as much as the circumstances will allow,\r\nhe must abstain from every thing, except egelid water. If the strength\r\nfails, it must be supported by hydromel. And against the pains the\r\napplication of hot fomentations is good, or such things as both repel\r\nand soften. It does good also to lay salt ground fine upon the breast,\r\nmixed with cerat; because it corrodes the skin gently, and thus diverts\r\nthe course of the matter, which oppresses the lungs. Some malagmas too\r\nof such things as make a derivation are useful. And it is not improper,\r\nduring the violence of the distemper, to keep the windows close upon\r\nthe patient: when it has a little abated, three or four times a day\r\nto open them a little and let in fresh air. Then when he begins to\r\nrecover, for several days to abstain from wine: to use gestation and\r\nfriction; to add to the gruels and former diet, amongst the pot-herbs\r\nleeks; of flesh, the heels, and trotters; and small fish; so that for a\r\nlong time nothing else be taken, but what is soft and mild.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. VIII.\r\n\r\nOF THE DISEASE OF THE LIVER, AND ITS CURE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe distemper of another bowel, that is the liver, in like manner\r\nhappens to be sometimes long and sometimes acute. The Greeks call\r\nit hepaticus[CV]. There is a violent pain to the right below the\r\npræcordia; and the same reaches to the right side, and to the clavicle,\r\nand the shoulder of the same side: sometimes also the right hand is\r\nbenumbed, and there is a strong shuddering. When it is severe, bile\r\nis vomited; sometimes the hiccough almost suffocates. And these are\r\nits symptoms, when it is acute. But it is chronical, when there is a\r\nsuppuration in the liver; and the pain sometimes ceases, at other times\r\nincreases; on the right side the præcordia are hard and swelled; after\r\neating, the difficulty of breathing is increased. There is also a sort\r\nof paralytic relaxation of the jaws. When the disorder has continued\r\nlong, the belly, and legs, and feet swell; the breast, and arms, and\r\nthe parts about both clavicles are emaciated.\r\n\r\n  [CV] ἡπατικὸς the adjective is used here in the same manner, as\r\n  pleuriticus before.\r\n\r\nIn the beginning, the best thing is to let blood: then the belly\r\nmust be opened; if that cannot be done otherwise, by means of black\r\nhellebore. Cataplasms are to be applied externally; first such as may\r\nrepel, then hot ones, which can discuss; to these it is proper to add\r\niris, or wormwood; after them a malagma. The diet should be gruels, and\r\nall the food should be warm, not very nourishing, and generally such\r\nas is proper in a peripneumony; and those besides that are diuretic,\r\nand such drink as will promote the same end. Thyme is good in this\r\ndistemper, savory, hyssop, catmint, sweet marjoram, sesamum(21),\r\nbay-berries, pine-flowers, blood herb, mint, the pulp of a quince, the\r\nfresh and raw liver of a pigeon. Of these some may be eaten alone, and\r\nothers added to the gruel, or the drinks, but in small quantities;\r\nand it is not improper to swallow every day a catapotium composed of\r\npowdered wormwood, honey, and pepper. But all cold things must be\r\nrefrained, for nothing hurts the liver more. The extremities must be\r\nrubbed. All labour and violent motion avoided: even the breath must not\r\nbe long kept in. Anger, flutter, lifting any thing weighty, throwing,\r\nrunning are hurtful. Pouring water plentifully upon the body does good,\r\nif it be the winter time, hot; if the summer, tepid; also plentiful\r\nunction, and sweating in the bath.\r\n\r\nIf the liver is oppressed with a vomica, the same method must be\r\nfollowed as in other internal suppurations. Some even make an incision\r\nover it(22), and cauterize the vomica itself.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. IX.\r\n\r\nOF THE DISORDER OF THE SPLEEN, AND ITS CURE.\r\n\r\n\r\nBut when the spleen is affected, it swells, and together with it the\r\nleft side, which is both hard and resists pressure; and the belly is\r\ntense: there is some swelling also in the legs. Ulcers either do not\r\nheal at all, or at least scarcely cicatrize. In walking briskly or\r\nrunning, there is a pain, and some difficulty.\r\n\r\nThis malady is increased by rest. Therefore there is a necessity for\r\nexercise and labour: care being taken however that these be not carried\r\ntoo far, lest they produce a fever. Unction and friction, and sweatings\r\nare necessary. Every thing sweet is hurtful; also milk, and cheese.\r\nAcids are most agreeable; therefore it is good to sup sharp vinegar\r\nalone, and more especially that, which is tinctured with squills. Salt\r\nfish is to be eaten, or olives in hard brine; lettuce in vinegar;\r\nendive also, and betes in the same manner; and mustard, wild radish,\r\nand parsnips: of animal food the heels, and cheeks, lean birds, and\r\nvenison of the same kind. A decoction of wormwood in water may be\r\ngiven for drink fasting: but after meat the water, in which a smith has\r\noften extinguished hot iron, for this very powerfully contracts the\r\nspleen: the discovery of which property we owe to an observation made\r\nupon animals bred in the houses of smiths, that they have very small\r\nspleens. Small and austere wine may also be given; and every thing in\r\nfood or drink, which is diuretic: of great efficacy for that purpose is\r\ntrefoil seed, or cummin, or smallage, or serpyllum, or cytisus(23),\r\nor thyme, or hyssop, or savory: for these seem very proper to promote a\r\ndischarge of the humour from it. It is good also to eat of the spleen\r\nof beef: and rocket and cresses are remarkable for attenuating the\r\nspleen. There must be some external application to ease the pain. Such\r\nis composed from a kind of acorns(24) used by the Unguentarii, which\r\nthe Greeks call myrobalani[CW]: or the seeds of lint, and cresses mixed\r\nwith wine and oil: also of green cypress and dry figs: or of mustard\r\nand a fourth part of the suet of a goat’s kidneys, and this is rubbed\r\nin the sun and applied immediately. And the caper too is fit for this\r\ndisorder in many forms; for it may both be eaten itself with meat, and\r\nits pickle with vinegar supped. Moreover the root powdered or its bark\r\nwith bran, or the caper itself powdered, and mixed with honey, may be\r\napplied externally. There are also malagmas calculated for this purpose.\r\n\r\n  [CW] μυροβάλανοι.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. X.\r\n\r\nOF THE DISEASES OF THE KIDNEYS, AND THEIR CURE.\r\n\r\n\r\nBut where the kidneys are affected, the disorder continues long. It\r\nis worse if attended with a frequent bilious vomiting. It is proper\r\nto rest; to lie soft; to open the belly; and even to give a clyster\r\nif it will not do without it; to sit down often in warm water; to\r\ntake neither meat nor drink cold; to abstain from every thing salt,\r\nacrimonious, acid, and fruit of the apple kind; to drink freely; to\r\nadd sometimes to the meat, and sometimes to the drink, pepper, leeks,\r\nferula(25), white poppies, which usually cause a great discharge of\r\nurine from the kidneys.\r\n\r\nIf they be ulcerated, and the ulcers are to be cleansed, the remedy is\r\nsixty seeds of cucumber blanched, fifteen kernels of the wild pine, as\r\nmuch anise as can be held betwixt three fingers, a little saffron; all\r\nthese powdered, and divided into two draughts of mulse.\r\n\r\nIf the pain only is to be relieved, _the medicine is_ thirty seeds\r\nof cucumber, and twenty of the kernels mentioned before, five sweet\r\nalmonds, a little saffron powdered, and given to drink with milk. And\r\nbesides these it is proper to apply some malagmas; especially such as\r\nare fit for drawing out moisture.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. XI.\r\n\r\nOF THE CHOLERA, AND ITS CURE.\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom the bowels we proceed to the intestines, which are obnoxious both\r\nto acute and chronic distempers. And first of all we shall make mention\r\nof the cholera; because that seems at once to affect equally the\r\nstomach and intestines. For at the same time there is both a purging\r\nand vomiting: besides these, there are flatulencies, the intestines are\r\nracked, bile is forced both upwards and downwards, first resembling\r\nwater, then as if fresh meat had been washed in it, sometimes white,\r\nsometimes black, or variously coloured. Upon this account the Greeks\r\ngave this distemper the name of cholera[CX]. And besides what we have\r\ntaken notice of already, the legs and hands too are often contracted,\r\nthirst torments, and there are faintings. Where all these concur, it is\r\nnot to be wondered, if the patient die suddenly. And nevertheless there\r\nis no distemper obviated with less trouble.\r\n\r\n  [CX] χολέρα.\r\n\r\nWherefore upon the first appearance of these symptoms it is proper to\r\ndrink plenty of tepid water and to vomit. That scarce ever fails to\r\nvomit: but although it miscarries in that, yet it is of use to mix\r\nnew matter with the corrupted; and it is a step in the recovery, if\r\nthe vomiting be stopped. If that happens, all drink must immediately\r\nbe abstained from. But if there be bloody stools, it is fit to bathe\r\nthe stomach with something cold, or if the belly be pained, with the\r\nsame egelid, the belly itself being assisted by medicines moderately\r\nwarm. But if the vomiting, and purging, and thirst, all at once torment\r\ngreatly, and what is vomited is yet somewhat crude, it is not a proper\r\ntime to give wine: water must be given, and that not cold, but rather\r\negelid. And penny-royal with vinegar must be applied to the nostrils,\r\nor polenta sprinkled with wine, or mint, or what is _comfortable or\r\nrefreshing_ to nature(26).\r\n\r\nBut when the crudity is removed, then there is more apprehension of the\r\nperson fainting. Wherefore at such time recourse must be had to wine:\r\nwhich ought to be small, aromatic, and mixed with cold water, either\r\nwith the addition of polenta, or a piece of bread, which also it is\r\nproper to eat: and as often as the stomach or belly has discharged, so\r\noften to recruit the strength by these means. Erasistratus directed\r\nto mix at first three or five drops of wine with every draught, and\r\nthen to add more wine by degrees. He was in the right, if he gave wine\r\nfrom the beginning, and then found reason to fear a crudity: but if he\r\nimagined a great weakness could be relieved by three drops of wine, he\r\nwas mistaken.\r\n\r\nBut if the patient be empty, and his legs contracted, wormwood must be\r\ngiven to drink now and then. If the extremities be cold, they must be\r\nanointed with hot oil, with the addition of a little wax; and cherished\r\nwith hot fomentations. If even by these relief has not been procured,\r\na cucurbital must be applied externally over the stomach itself, or\r\nmustard put upon it. When that is composed, it is proper for him to\r\nsleep; and on the day following to abstain from drinking; on the third\r\nday to go into the bath; to recruit himself gradually by food; and\r\nsleep, if he can rest easily; and to avoid fatigue and colds. If after\r\nthe suppression of the cholera a feverishness remains, it is necessary\r\nto give a clyster, then to take food and wine. Now this distemper is\r\nboth acute, and so much seated betwixt the intestines and the stomach,\r\nthat it is hard to say, to which it peculiarly belongs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. XII.\r\n\r\nOF THE COELIAC DISTEMPER OF THE STOMACH, AND ITS CURE.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt the lower orifice of the stomach is seated a distemper, which is\r\nusually long, called cœliacus[CY] by the Greeks. In this the abdomen\r\ngrows hard, and is pained; there is no passage by stool, and not so\r\nmuch as wind can escape; the extremities grow cold; and there is a\r\ndifficulty in breathing.\r\n\r\n  [CY] κοιλιακὸς.\r\n\r\nIt is most proper in the beginning to apply warm cataplasms over all\r\nthe belly to ease the pain; after meat to vomit, and thus to empty the\r\nbelly; then on the following days to apply cucurbitals (without making\r\nany incision) to the belly and hips: to loosen the belly itself by\r\ngiving milk and salt wine cold; green figs also, if it be the season\r\nfor them; with this caution however, that neither the allowance of food\r\nnor drink be given all at once, but gradually. Wherefore at intervals\r\nit is sufficient to take two or three cyathi, and food in proportion to\r\nthis. And a cyathus of milk mixed with an equal quantity of water, and\r\nso given, does very well. Warm and acrid food is proper; so that even\r\nbruised garlic with milk is no bad mixture.\r\n\r\nIn a little time the case requires gestation, and especially sailing;\r\nto be rubbed three or four times a day with oil and nitre together; to\r\nhave warm water poured on after meat; then to apply mustard to all the\r\nparts of the body, except the head, till they be corroded and grow red;\r\nand more especially if the body be firm and strong. Then there must be\r\na gradual change to such things as bind the belly. Strong roasted flesh\r\nis to be given, and such as is not easily corrupted: boiled rain water\r\nmay be given to drink, to the quantity of two or three cyathi at a time.\r\n\r\nIf the disorder be of long standing, it is proper to swallow the bulk\r\nof a pepper-corn of the best laser; and every other day to drink wine\r\nor water, at times to sup single cyathi of wine, taking food between;\r\nto give a clyster of rain-water egelid; and more especially if the pain\r\ncontinues in the lower parts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. XIII.\r\n\r\nOF THE DISTEMPER OF THE SMALL GUT, AND ITS CURE.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo the intestines themselves two distempers are peculiar; one of\r\nwhich is in the small, and the other in the large gut. The first is\r\nacute: the other may continue long. Diodes the Carystian called the\r\ndistemper of the small intestine chordapsus[CZ], that of the larger he\r\nnamed ileus[DA]. But I observe, that most people now call the first\r\nileus, and the other colicus[DB]. Now the first occasions a pain,\r\nsometimes above, sometimes below the navel. In either place there is\r\nan inflammation: neither the excrements nor wind can pass downwards.\r\nIf the upper part is affected, the food, if the lower, the excrements\r\nare returned by the mouth: in either case there is danger; which is\r\nincreased, if the vomiting be bilious, fetid, or various, or black.\r\n\r\n  [CZ] χόρδαψος.\r\n\r\n  [DA] εἰλεὸς.\r\n\r\n  [DB] κολικὸς.\r\n\r\nThe cure is letting of blood; or applying cucurbitals in several\r\nplaces, but not to make incisions of the skin every where; for that\r\nis sufficient in two or three places: from the rest it suffices to\r\nevacuate air. Then it is proper to observe, where the seat of the\r\ndisorder is; for there is commonly a swelling over it. And if it be\r\nabove the navel, a clyster signifies nothing: if it is below, it\r\nis most proper, in the opinion of Erasistratus, to give clysters\r\nsometimes; and this remedy is often of very great service in these\r\nparts. The liquor proper for this is strained cream of ptisan, with\r\nthe addition of oil and honey without any thing else. If there is\r\nno swelling, it is most proper to apply the two hands to the top of\r\nthe belly, and to bring them down gradually; for thus the seat of\r\nthe disorder will be discovered, as it will necessarily resist the\r\npressure: and from thence it may be determined, whether it is fit to\r\nuse clysters or not.\r\n\r\nThe following remedies are general: to apply hot cataplasms from the\r\nbreasts as far as the groin and spine, and to change them often; to\r\nrub the legs and arms; to dip the patient all over in warm oil. If the\r\npain does not abate, to give even a clyster of three or four cyathi\r\nof warm oil. When by these means we have procured a passage for the\r\nwind downward, to give tepid mulse to drink, but in small quantity,\r\nfor before great care must be taken that he drink nothing: if that has\r\nsucceeded well, to add gruel.\r\n\r\nWhen the pain and feverishness have ceased, then we may venture upon\r\na fuller diet; but neither flatulent nor strong, lest the intestines\r\nyet weak be hurt. Nothing should be drunk but pure water; for every\r\nthing either vinous or acid is prejudicial in this distemper. And even\r\nafterwards it is proper to avoid the bath, walking, gestation, and\r\nother motions of the body: for the disease is apt to return upon slight\r\noccasions; and cold, or any violent motion, before the intestines have\r\nfully recovered their strength, brings it back again.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. XIV.\r\n\r\nOF THE DISEASE OF THE LARGE INTESTINE, AND ITS CURE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThat distemper, which is seated in the large intestine, principally\r\naffects that part, where I mentioned the cæcum to be situated. There\r\nis a violent inflation; vehement pains, especially on the right side:\r\nthe intestine seems to be inverted, which almost forces out the wind.\r\nIn most people it comes after colds and crudity, then ceases; and while\r\nthey live, it often returns, and torments, but does not shorten life.\r\n\r\nWhen this pain has begun, it is proper to apply dry and warm\r\nfomentations, but first of all mild, and then stronger; and at the same\r\ntime by friction to make a derivation of the matter to the extremities,\r\nthat is, the legs and arms: if it is not removed, to make use of dry\r\ncupping, where the pain is. There is also a medicine calculated for\r\nthis distemper, which is called colicon[DC]. Cassius claimed the glory\r\nof this invention. It has the best effect given by way of potion; but\r\neven externally applied by dispersing the wind it eases the pain.\r\n\r\nNeither food nor drink should be given, till the pain be over.\r\nThe regimen for such patients I have already mentioned(27). The\r\ncomposition, which is called colicon, consists of the following\r\ningredients: of costus, anise, castor, each p. * iii. parsley, p. *\r\niv. long pepper and round, each p. * v. tears of poppy, round cyperus,\r\nmyrrh, nard, of each p. * vi. these are incorporated in honey. Now this\r\nmay be both swallowed alone, and taken with warm water.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. XV.\r\n\r\nOF A DYSENTERY, AND ITS CURE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe next disorder of the intestines to this is by us called tormina,\r\nand by the Greeks dysenteria[DD]. The intestines are ulcerated within;\r\nblood flows from them; and together with that either excrements, which\r\nare always liquid, or something mucous are discharged; sometimes along\r\nwith it, something fleshy is excerned. There is a frequent desire of\r\ngoing to stool, and a pain in the anus: with this pain a very small\r\nquantity is excreted; and even by that the pain is increased; and after\r\nsome time it abates, and there is a small interval of ease; sleep is\r\ninterrupted; a slight fever comes on; and when this distemper grows\r\ninveterate, it either kills a man in time, or though it terminates at\r\nlast, torments him long.\r\n\r\n  [DC] κολικὸν.\r\n\r\n  [DD] δυσεντερία.\r\n\r\nThe first rule to be observed, is to rest; for all kinds of agitation\r\nulcerate: then to sup a cyathus of wine fasting, with the bruised root\r\nof cinquefoil; to apply restringent cataplasms over the belly, which\r\nis not expedient in the abovementioned disorders of this part; and as\r\noften as he has gone to stool, to wash his lower parts with a warm\r\ndecoction of vervains; to eat purslane, either boiled or preserved in\r\nstrong brine; to take such food and drink as bind the belly.\r\n\r\nIf the distemper is of longer standing, it is fit to administer a tepid\r\ninjection of the cream of ptisan or milk, or melted fat, or deer’s\r\nmarrow, or oil, or butter with rose oil, or the raw whites of eggs with\r\nthe same, or a decoction of lintseed; or if there is no sleep, the\r\nyolks with a decoction of rose leaves: for these ease the pain, and\r\nrender the ulcers milder, and are especially useful, if the disorder be\r\nalso attended with a nausea. Themison asserts, that the roughest brine\r\nshould be used in the same manner.\r\n\r\nThe food ought to be such, as is gently astringent to the belly. But\r\ndiureticks, if they have their natural effect, are useful by making a\r\nderivation of the humour: if they do not gain that point, they increase\r\nthe malady; therefore they must not be administered, but to such, as\r\nthey usually affect in that way easily. If there be a fever, pure warm\r\nwater must be given to drink, or such as has an astringent quality:\r\nif that is not to be got, light, austere wine. If for several days\r\nthese remedies have done no good, and the distemper is now inveterate,\r\ndrinking of water pretty cold binds the ulcers, and begins a recovery.\r\nBut when the belly is once bound, they must immediately return to warm\r\ndrink.\r\n\r\nSometimes also there happens to be a discharge of putrid sanies, which\r\nhas an intolerable stench: and sometimes pure blood comes away. In\r\nthe first of these cases, the belly should be washed with hydromel;\r\nafter that the injections above prescribed must be used. And a piece\r\nof minium(28) powdered with a hemina of salt, is powerful against a\r\ngangrene of the intestines: or they may be mixed with water, and given\r\nfor a clyster. But if pure blood is evacuated, the food and drink ought\r\nto be astringent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. XVI.\r\n\r\nOF A LIENTERY, AND ITS CURE.\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom a dysentery sometimes proceeds a lientery, in which the intestines\r\ncan retain nothing, and whatever is taken they presently pass\r\nunconcocted. This sometimes is tedious, and sometimes carries off\r\npeople quickly.\r\n\r\nNow in this disorder it is proper to administer astringents, to enable\r\nthe intestines to retain. Wherefore mustard should be applied over the\r\nbreast; and when the skin is ulcerated, a malagma to discharge the\r\nhumour: and let the patient sit down in a decoction of the vervains;\r\nand take such food and drink as bind the belly, and have cold water\r\npoured over him.\r\n\r\nCare should be taken, however, that upon the application of all these\r\nremedies at once, there do not arise a malady on the contrary extreme\r\nby means of immoderate flatulencies. Wherefore the intestines will\r\nrequire to be strengthened gradually by the daily addition of somewhat.\r\nAnd as in every flux of the belly, so in this, it is particularly\r\nnecessary to go to stool not as often as there is a motion, but as\r\noften as there is an absolute necessity, that this very delay may bring\r\nthe intestines to a habit of bearing their burden.\r\n\r\nThere is another direction, which belongs equally to all similar\r\ndisorders, to be principally regarded in this; that since most of the\r\nthings proper for the disorder are disagreeable to the palate, such as\r\nplantain, and bramble berries, and whatever is mixed with pomegranate\r\nbark, such of these are to be chosen as the patient prefers. Then if\r\nhe has an aversion to them all, let something less beneficial, but\r\nmore grateful, be given at times to excite his appetite. Exercise\r\nand friction are necessary also in this distemper: and with these,\r\naccording to Hippocrates, the heat of the sun, the fire, the bath, and\r\nvomiting, even by white hellebore, if the other means for that purpose\r\nprove unsuccessful.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. XVII.\r\n\r\nOF WORMS IN THE BELLY, AND THEIR CURE.\r\n\r\n\r\nWorms too sometimes infest the belly; and they are sometimes discharged\r\ndownwards, at other times, which is more disagreeable, from the mouth:\r\nand sometimes we observe them to be broad, which are the worst kind,\r\nand sometimes round.\r\n\r\nIf they are broad, a decoction of lupines, or mulberry bark in water\r\nmay be given to drink: or either hyssop, or an acetabulum of pepper\r\npowdered, and a scammony with water. Or let the patient on one day,\r\nafter eating plentifully of garlick, vomit; and the day following take\r\na handful of the small stalks of the pomegranate, and boil these,\r\nafter bruising them, in three sextarii of water, till a third part\r\nremains; let him add to this a little nitre, and drink it fasting: then\r\nafter the interval of three hours let him take two draughts of this\r\ndecoction, or the same with the addition of hard brine; then go to\r\nstool, having hot water in a vessel below him.\r\n\r\nIf again they are round, which chiefly molest children, both the same\r\nmedicines may be given, and something more gentle, as the seed of\r\nnettles powdered, or of cabbage, or cummin with water, or mint with the\r\nsame, or a decoction of wormwood, or hyssop in hydromel, or the seed\r\nof cresses powdered with vinegar. It is good also to eat lupines, and\r\ngarlick, or to have clysters of oil administered.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. XVIII.\r\n\r\nOF A TENESMUS, AND ITS CURE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is also another distemper, which is more mild than any I have\r\nbeen treating of, called by the Greeks tenesmus[DE]. This ought to\r\nbe ranked neither with the acute nor the chronic disorders, since it\r\nmay be easily removed, and by itself never proves mortal. In this, as\r\nwell as in a dysentery, there is a frequent motion to stool; and equal\r\npain, when any thing is excreted. Something like to phlegm and mucus\r\nis discharged, sometimes too, slightly tinctured with blood; but with\r\nthese is sometimes mixed what has been duly concocted from the food.\r\n\r\n  [DE] τεινεσμὸς.\r\n\r\nIt is proper to sit down in warm water; to apply something to the anus\r\nitself pretty often. For which purpose many medicines are suitable:\r\nbutter with oil of roses; acacia dissolved in vinegar; that plaister,\r\nwhich the Greeks call tetrapharmacum(29), melted with rose oil;\r\nalum wrapped in wool, and thus applied; and the same injections which\r\nrelieve in the dysentery; the same decoction of vervains to foment the\r\nlower parts. Every other day, water and light austere wine are to be\r\ndrunk alternately. The drink ought to be egelid, and nearer to cold:\r\nthe diet of the same nature as we have directed for a dysentery.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. XIX.\r\n\r\nOF A SIMPLE PURGING, AND ITS CURE.\r\n\r\n\r\nA purging, while recent, is still a more gentle distemper, in which the\r\ndischarge is both liquid, and more frequent than ordinary. In this the\r\npain is sometimes tolerable, at other times very severe; and that shews\r\na greater violence of the disease. But for the belly to be loose for\r\none day is often salutary; and even for several days, provided there be\r\nno fever, and it cease in seven days. For thus the body is cleansed;\r\nand what would have hurt internally, is advantageously evacuated.\r\nBut the continuance of it is dangerous; for sometimes it brings on a\r\ndysentery, and febriculas, and wastes the strength.\r\n\r\nIt is sufficient to rest the first day; and not to stop the flux of\r\nthe belly. If it has ceased spontaneously, to make use of the bath, to\r\ntake a little food: if it continues, to abstain, not only from food,\r\nbut from drink also. On the day following, if the belly still be loose,\r\nto continue at rest; and take a very little astringent food. On the\r\nthird day to go into the bath; to rub every part of the body briskly,\r\nexcept the belly; to expose the loins and shoulders to the heat of the\r\nfire; to take food, but such as is astringent to the belly; a little\r\nwine undiluted. If on the day following the purging shall continue, to\r\neat more, but likewise to vomit. Upon the whole, to struggle against it\r\nby thirst, fasting, and vomiting, till it ceases: for it is scarcely\r\npossible, that after this care the belly should not be bound.\r\n\r\nThere is another method, when one has a mind to stop the flux, to\r\ntake supper, and then to vomit; on the day after, to rest in bed; to\r\nbe anointed in the evening, but gently; then to eat half a pound of\r\nbread in neat Aminaean wine; next, something roasted, and especially\r\na bird; and afterwards to drink the same wine mixed with rain water;\r\nand to continue in this course till the fifth day, and vomit again.\r\nAsclepiades, contrary to former authors, affirmed, that the drink ought\r\nalways to be cold, and indeed as cold as possible. My opinion is, that\r\nevery one may determine by his own experience, whether he should use it\r\nhot or cold.\r\n\r\nBut it sometimes happens, that this disorder, neglected for several\r\ndays, may be more difficult to cure; it is proper to begin with a\r\nvomit; then on the evening of the following day, to be anointed in a\r\ntepid place; to eat moderately, and drink wine undiluted and as rough\r\nas can be got; to keep rue with cerate applied over the belly. And in\r\nthis state of the body, neither walking nor friction are proper: riding\r\nin a chariot is good, on horseback much better; for nothing strengthens\r\nthe intestines more.\r\n\r\nIf medicines are to be made use of, those composed of the apple kind\r\nare most suitable. At the time of vintage, pears and crab apples\r\nare to be thrown into a large vessel; if these cannot be had, green\r\ntarentine pears, or signine, the apples called scandiana or amerina, or\r\npears called myrrhapia(30); and to these quinces must be added, and\r\npomegranates with their bark, service fruit, and, which are more used,\r\nthe torminalia, and let these take up the third part of the jar; after\r\nthat it must be filled with must, and boiled till the whole contents\r\nbeing dissolved unite into one mass. This is not unpleasant to the\r\ntaste; and whenever the case requires it, taken moderately, without\r\nany prejudice to the stomach it binds the belly: it is sufficient to\r\ntake two or three spoonfuls in one day. Another stronger medicine is,\r\nto gather myrtle berries, and press the wine from them, to boil it to\r\nthe tenth part, and sup a cyathus of that. The third, which may be got\r\nat any time, is to scoop a pomegranate, and taking out all the seeds,\r\nto put in again the membranes, that were betwixt them; then to drop in\r\nraw eggs, and mix them up with a small wooden stirrer; then to put the\r\nshell over the fire, which does not burn, while there is any moisture\r\nwithin; when it begins to grow dry, it is proper to remove it, and\r\ntaking out the contents with a spoon, to eat them. This acquires great\r\nefficacy by the addition of some other things: therefore it is even\r\nput into pepper wine, and mixed with salt, and pepper, and eaten with\r\nthese: and pulse may be taken also boiled with some old honeycomb. And\r\nlentils boiled with pomegranate bark, and bramble tops boiled in water,\r\nand eaten with oil and vinegar, are efficacious: as also to drink the\r\ndecoction either of dates, or quinces, or dry service fruit, or bramble\r\nberries; and I mean this kind of liquor, whenever I direct such drink\r\nto be given as is astringent. A hemina of wheat also is boiled in\r\naustere Aminaean wine; and the wheat is given to a person fasting and\r\nthirsty, and after that the wine is supped: this may justly be ranked\r\namongst the most powerful medicines. And the signine wine is given also\r\nto drink, or resinated austere, or any other austere kind. And the\r\npomegranate is bruised with its shells and seeds, and is mixed with\r\nsuch wine; and a person either sups this alone, or drinks it mixed. But\r\nthe use of medicines is needless, unless where the disorder is violent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. XX.\r\n\r\nOF THE DISEASES OF THE WOMB, AND THEIR CURE.\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom the womb in women proceeds a violent distemper; and next to the\r\nstomach, this part both suffers most sensibly itself, and most affects\r\nthe rest of the body. Sometimes it destroys the senses, so as to\r\noccasion their falling as in an epilepsy: but with this difference,\r\nthat the eyes are not turned, nor is there any discharge of froth,\r\nnor convulsions: there is only a profound sleep. In some women this\r\ndistemper returns frequently, and attends them during the whole course\r\nof their lives.\r\n\r\nWhen it attacks, if there be sufficient strength, bleeding relieves:\r\nif there is not, yet cucurbitals must be applied to both sides of the\r\ngroin. If the patient lies long in this state, or used to do so, it is\r\nproper to hold to the nostrils the extinguished wick of a lamp, or some\r\nother of these things I have mentioned of a remarkably bad smell, in\r\norder to rouse the woman. The same purpose is obtained by the pouring\r\non of cold water. And rue bruised small with honey is good, or cerate\r\nof cyprine oil, or any other hot and moist cataplasm, applied from the\r\npudenda up to the pubes. In the mean time, the hips and hams ought also\r\nto be rubbed.\r\n\r\nAfter this, when she returns to herself, she must be forbid wine for a\r\nwhole year, even although the disorder do not return. Friction must be\r\npractised every day over the whole body, but chiefly on the belly and\r\nhams. Food of the middle kind must be given: mustard be applied to the\r\nlower belly every third or fourth day, till the skin grow red.\r\n\r\nIf the hardness continue(31), nightshade dipt in milk, and then\r\nrubbed small, seems to be a proper emollient, and white wax and deers\r\nmarrow with iris ointment, or beef suet, or goat’s, mixed with rose\r\noil. In drink must be given either castor, or git, or dill. If she is\r\nnot in good habit, she may be purged with the cyperus. If the womb\r\nis ulcerated, a cerate may be made of rose oil, also fresh hogs lard\r\nmixed with whites of eggs may be applied: or the white of an egg mixed\r\nwith rose oil, with the addition of some powder of roses to help the\r\nconsistence. But when the womb is pained, it ought to be fumigated with\r\nsulphur.\r\n\r\nBut if an excessive discharge hurts a woman, the remedy is to make an\r\nincision in the skin, and apply cucurbitals either to the groin or\r\nbelow the breasts. If the discharge is malignant,(32) restringents\r\nmust be used. This intention is answered by white olives, black poppies\r\ntaken with honey, and gum liquified, together with the powdered seed\r\nof smallage, and given in a cyathus of passum.\r\n\r\nBesides these, in all disorders of the womb, such drink is proper as is\r\nmade of the aromaticks, that is, spikenard, saffron, cinnamon, cassia,\r\nand the like. The mastich tree boiled to a decoction has the same\r\neffects. But if the pain be intolerable, and blood is discharged, even\r\nbleeding is proper; or at least the application of cucurbitals to the\r\nhips, after making an incision in the skin.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Of an excessive discharge of urine._]\r\n\r\nBut when urine is made beyond the measure of what is drunk, and coming\r\naway without pain emaciates, and creates danger, if it be limpid, there\r\nis a necessity for exercise and friction, especially in the sun, or\r\nat the fire. The bath ought to be seldom used, and the stay in it but\r\nshort; the food astringent; the wine austere and undiluted, in summer\r\ncold, in winter egelid, but as little as possible. The belly should be\r\neither opened by a clyster, or purged with milk. If the urine is thick,\r\nboth the exercise and friction ought to be more violent; the stay in\r\nthe bath longer; the food tender; wine as above directed: in both\r\ncases, every thing that provokes urine must be avoided.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. XXI.\r\n\r\nOF AN EXCESSIVE DISCHARGE OF SEMEN, AND ITS CURE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is also a distemper about the parts of generation, an excessive\r\nprofusion of semen, which without venery or dreams, runs off in such\r\nquantities, that in time it destroys a man by a consumption.\r\n\r\nIn this disorder brisk frictions, pouring water over the body, and\r\nswimming in water extremely cold are salutary: no food nor drink but\r\nwhat is taken cold. It is proper also to avoid crudities, and every\r\nthing flatulent; and to take nothing that seems to generate semen: such\r\nare siligo, fine flour of wheat, eggs, alica, starch, all glutinous\r\nflesh, pepper, rocket, bulbous roots, pine nuts. And it is not improper\r\nto foment the lower parts with a decoction of the astringent vervains,\r\nand to apply a cataplasm composed of the same to the lower belly and\r\ngroin; and especially rue with vinegar(33); and the person should be\r\ncautious not to sleep supine.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. XXII.\r\n\r\nOF THE DISEASE OF THE HIPS, AND ITS CURE.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt remains that I come to the extremities, which are connected together\r\nby articulations. I shall begin with the hips. In these a violent pain\r\narises, which often weakens, and some people it never leaves: and\r\nfor this reason that species is most difficult to cure, which after\r\nlong diseases turns upon this part with a pernicious force: and as it\r\nrelieves other parts, so it takes a fast hold of this, which it affects.\r\n\r\nFomentations of hot water must be used first; then warm cataplasms. The\r\napplications, which appear to be most useful in this case, are the bark\r\nof capers cut small and mixed with barley-meal, or with a fig boiled\r\nin water; or the meal of darnel boiled with diluted wine, and mixed\r\nwith dry lees. It is more convenient to apply these malagmas in the\r\nnight-time, because they are apt to grow cold. The root of elicampane\r\nalso bruised, and after boiled with austere wine, and spread all over\r\nthe hip is amongst the most powerful remedies. If these do not discuss\r\nthe malady, hot and moist salt must be made use of.\r\n\r\nIf the pain is not removed by this method neither, or a swelling\r\ncomes on, the skin must be cut and cucurbitals applied; urine must be\r\npromoted; and if the belly be bound a clyster must be given. The last\r\nremedy, which is also of great efficacy in disorders of the womb, is to\r\nmake ulcers in the skin with hot irons in three or four places above\r\nthe hip. To make use of friction too, chiefly in the sun, and several\r\ntimes in one day: that this hurtful collection of humours may be more\r\neasily discussed. The hips themselves may be rubbed, if there be no\r\nulcer; if there is, the other parts of the body. Now since an ulcer\r\nis frequently to be made with hot iron, that noxious matter may be\r\nevacuated, this is always to be observed, that ulcers of this kind be\r\nnot healed, as soon as may be; but kept open, till the distemper, which\r\nwe propose to cure by them ceases.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. XXIII.\r\n\r\nOF A PAIN IN THE KNEES, AND ITS CURE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe knees are next to the hips, in which there sometimes happens to be\r\na pain. The cure consists in the same cataplasms and cupping: which\r\nare the remedies also when any pain arises in the shoulders, or the\r\nother joints. It is most hurtful of all things for one, whose knees are\r\npained, to ride on horseback. Now all pains of this kind, when they\r\nhave continued long, are scarcely cured without the use of the actual\r\ncautery.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. XXIV.\r\n\r\nOF THE DISEASES IN THE JOINTS OF THE HANDS AND FEET, AND THEIR CURE.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the hands and feet the diseases of the joints are more frequent, and\r\ncontinue longer. Such as happen to gouty people in these places, seldom\r\ndisturb either eunuchs, or boys before coition, or women unless their\r\nmenses be suppressed.\r\n\r\nWhen they begin to feel them, blood must be let. For this done\r\nimmediately at the beginning often procures good health for a whole\r\nyear, sometimes for life. Some too by cleansing themselves thoroughly\r\nby drinking asses milk, have prevented its ever returning; Others\r\nby abstaining from wine, mulse and venery for a year, have rendered\r\nthemselves secure from it for their whole life. And this method is to\r\nbe pursued after the first attack of the pain, although it has ceased.\r\nBut if the fits of it are grown customary, one may indeed be more\r\nsecure at such times as the pain has remitted: but more care ought to\r\nbe taken at such seasons, as it returns(34), which happens commonly\r\nin the spring or autumn.\r\n\r\nNow when the pain is not violent, the patient ought to use gestation\r\nin the morning; then to be carried, or to exercise himself by walking\r\ngently, and if the gout be in the foot, at small intervals alternately\r\nsometimes to sit, sometimes to walk; next before he takes food, without\r\nbathing to be rubbed gently in a warm place, to sweat, and have egelid\r\nwater poured over him; after that to take food of the middle kind,\r\nmaking use at times of diuretics; and whenever he turns plethoric to\r\nvomit.\r\n\r\nWhen the pain is very violent, it makes a difference, whether there\r\nbe no swelling, or a tumour with heat, or a swelling already grown\r\ncallous. For if there is no tumour, hot fomentations are required. It\r\nis proper to heat sea-water, or strong brine, then to pour it into a\r\nbason, and when the patient can bear it, to put his feet into it, and\r\nspread his gown over them, and cover them beside with cloaths, pouring\r\nin gradually at the edge of the vessel some of the same liquor, that\r\nthe heat within may not decrease; and then in the night-time to apply\r\nheating cataplasms, and especially the root of marshmallows boiled in\r\nwine. But if there be a swelling and heat, coolers are more proper, and\r\nit is fit to keep the joints in the coldest water; but neither every\r\nday, nor long at a time, lest the nerves be indurated. And a cooling\r\ncataplasm must be applied: nor must even that be continued long; but a\r\nchange must be made to those things, which are repellent, and at the\r\nsame time emollient.\r\n\r\nIf the pain be more severe, the bark of poppies must be boiled in\r\nwine, and mixed with cerate made of rose-oil: or equal quantities of\r\nwax and hogs lard must be melted together, then wine mixed with them;\r\nand whenever an application of this medicine has grown hot, it must be\r\nremoved, and another put on immediately.\r\n\r\nBut if the tumours have grown callous, and are painful, they are\r\nrelieved by the application of a sponge squeezed now and then out of\r\noil, or vinegar, or cold water; or by equal parts of pitch, wax and\r\nalum mixed together. There are also several malagmas proper for the\r\nhands and feet. But if the pain will allow nothing to be laid on, it is\r\nfit to foment the part, which is not swelled, with a sponge dipped in\r\na warm decoction of poppy-bark, or the roots of wild cucumber; then to\r\nput over the joints saffron with the juice of poppies and ewes milk.\r\n\r\nBut if there is a swelling, it ought to be fomented with an egelid\r\ndecoction of mastic-tree, or any other of the restringent vervains;\r\nand be covered with a medicine composed of bitter almonds powdered,\r\nand vinegar; or ceruss with an addition of the juice of the wall-herb\r\nbruised. The stone also, which eats flesh, by the Greeks called\r\n[DF]sarcophagus(35), cut into such a form as to receive the feet,\r\nusually relieves their pain, when they are put into it and kept there.\r\nOf this they make sepulchres in Assus. And the Asian stone(36) also\r\nhas its merit for giving ease.\r\n\r\n  [DF] σαρκοφάγος.\r\n\r\nWhen the pain and inflammation have remitted (which happens within\r\nthirty days, unless the patient has been faulty) moderate exercises,\r\nabstinence, gentle unctions must be used, the joints being at the same\r\ntime rubbed with an acopon(37), or liquid cerate of cyprine oil.\r\nRiding is hurtful, to those that have the gout in their feet.\r\n\r\nThose, who have stated returns of this pain, before them ought both\r\nby a strict regimen to take care to prevent the redundancy of hurtful\r\nmatter in the body, and to use frequent vomiting, and if there is\r\nreason to apprehend a present plethora, either clysters, or purging by\r\nmilk. Which Erasistratus declared against, when the feet were gouty;\r\nlest the course of the humours downward should occasion a redundancy in\r\nthe feet: though it is evident in every purgation, that not only the\r\nsuperior parts, but the inferior also are emptied.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. XXV.\r\n\r\nOF THE TREATMENT OF PATIENTS RECOVERING.\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom whatever distemper a person is recovering, if he gathers\r\nstrength slowly, he ought to awake at day-light, nevertheless to\r\nlie still in bed; about the third hour to rub his body gently with\r\nhis hands anointed. Then to amuse himself by walking as long as he\r\nfinds it agreeable, laying aside all attention to business; then to\r\nuse gestation for a long time, much friction; to change often his\r\nsituation, air, and food. When he has drunk wine for three or four\r\ndays, for one or even two to interpose water. For by these methods he\r\nshall both escape those distempers, that bring on a consumption, and\r\nmay quickly recover his strength. But when he is entirely recovered,\r\nit will be dangerous for him to change his course suddenly, and turn\r\nirregular. Therefore he ought by slow degrees to lay aside these\r\nrestraints, and change to the way of life most agreeable to his\r\nhumour(38).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA. CORNELIUS CELSUS\r\n\r\n        OF\r\n\r\n     MEDICINE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_BOOK V._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE.\r\n\r\n\r\nHaving gone through those disorders of the body, which are principally\r\nrelieved by diet, we must now proceed to that branch of physic, which\r\ndepends more upon medicines. The ancient authors put great confidence\r\nin them; so did Erasistratus, and those, who stiled themselves\r\nempiricks. Their efficacy was still more extolled by Herophilus and his\r\nfollowers; insomuch that they attempted to cure no distemper without\r\nthem. They have written a great deal too concerning the virtues of\r\nmedicines: such are the treatises of Zeno, or Andreas, or Apollonius,\r\nwho was sirnamed Mus. Not without reason Asclepiades in a great\r\nmeasure laid aside the use of them: and because almost all medicines\r\noffend the stomach, and afford bad juices, he chose to apply all his\r\ncare to the management of the diet. But though this be more useful in\r\nmost distempers, yet many disorders are incident to our bodies, which\r\ncannot be totally removed without medicines. It is fit to observe in\r\nthe first place, that all the branches of medicine are so connected\r\ntogether, that they cannot be entirely separated; but each derives its\r\nappellation from that, which is principally made use of in it. And\r\ntherefore as that, which cures by diet, sometimes employs medicines; so\r\nthe other, which chiefly works by medicines, ought also to take in the\r\ndiet, which is of great service in all disorders of the body. But since\r\nall medicines have some peculiar powers, and often give relief single,\r\noften mixed, it seems not improper first of all to mention both their\r\nnames and virtues, and the compositions of them; that our work may be\r\nshortened, when we come to the curative part.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. I.\r\n\r\nMEDICINES FOR STOPPING BLOOD.\r\n\r\n\r\nA bleeding is stopped by copperas, which the Greeks call\r\nchalcanthus[DG], chalcitis(1), acacia, lycium with water,\r\nfrankincense, aloes, gum(2), calcined lead(3), leeks, blood herb,\r\neither Cimolian, or potter’s chalk, misy(4), cold water, wine,\r\nvinegar, allum(5), melinum(6), scales both of iron(7) and copper;\r\nand of this last there are two species, the one of common copper, the\r\nother of red copper.\r\n\r\n  [DG] χάλκανθος.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP.

XVI.\r\n\r\nCLEANSERS OF THE SKIN.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe skin is cleansed by honey, for which purpose it is more effectual\r\nwhen mixed with galls, or vetches, or lentils, or horehound, or iris,\r\nor rue, or nitre, or verdigrease.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. XVII.\r\n\r\nOF THE MIXTURE OF SIMPLES; AND OF THE PROPORTION OF THE WEIGHTS.\r\n\r\n\r\nHaving mentioned the virtues of the simples, we are next to shew in\r\nwhat manner they are to be mixed, and what compositions are made from\r\nthem. Now they are mixed variously, and there is no certain method for\r\nit, since of similar ingredients some are taken away, and others are\r\nadded; and though the very same simples are all used, the proportion\r\nof their weights may be changed. And therefore though the number of\r\nmedicinal simples be not so very great, there are innumerable kinds\r\nof mixtures; which it would be needless to enumerate, though it were\r\npossible: both because the same effects are found within the compass\r\nof a few compositions; and because it is easy for any person, who\r\nis acquainted with their virtues, to change them. I shall therefore\r\nconfine myself to the most esteemed. Now in this book I shall give an\r\naccount of those, which may either have been wanted in the preceding,\r\nor are employed in the cures, which I am to treat of, only throwing\r\ntogether these compositions, which are of more general use. Such as\r\nare accommodated to one particular disorder, or even to a few, I will\r\ninsert in their proper places.\r\n\r\nBut before I proceed, I would have it understood, that in an ounce\r\nis contained the weight of seven denarii. Next, that I divide each\r\ndenarius into six parts, that is sextantes, so that I have the same\r\nquantity in the sextans of a denarius, that the Greeks have in their\r\nobolus[DM]. That being reduced to our weights makes a little more than\r\nhalf a scruple.\r\n\r\n  [DM] ὀβολὸς.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Of the difference betwixt malagmas, plaisters, and\r\ntroches._]\r\n\r\nNow malagmas, and plaisters, and troches, which the Greeks call\r\ntrochischi[DN], though in many things they are the same, differ in\r\nthis, that malagmas are chiefly made from flowers, and even their\r\nstalks, plaisters and troches are more generally composed of some\r\nmetallic ingredients. Then malagmas being beat up are abundantly soft:\r\nfor they are applied, where the skin is unbroken: but those things, of\r\nwhich plaisters and troches are made, are carefully powdered; lest they\r\nhurt wounds, when they are laid on. Betwixt a plaister and a troche\r\nthere is this difference, that a plaister admits of something melted:\r\nin a troche there are only dry medicines united by some liquid. Again,\r\na plaister is made in this manner: The dry medicines are powdered by\r\nthemselves: when they are mixed, vinegar is dropped into them, or any\r\nother liquor belonging to the composition, that is not greasy; and they\r\nare again rubbed with that. Those things, that are capable of being\r\nmelted, are melted altogether at the fire; and if any oil is to be in\r\nthe mixture, it is then poured in. Sometimes too, some one of the dry\r\ningredients is first boiled with oil. When these things are finished,\r\nwhich ought to be done separately, the whole is mixed together into one\r\nmass. But the way of making troches is this: The dry medicines being\r\npowdered are formed into one body with a liquor not greasy, such as\r\nwine or vinegar, and again after being brought to a consistence, grow\r\ndry: and when they are to be used, are diluted by a liquor of the same\r\nkind. _There is also a difference in the manner of using these_: for a\r\nplaister is simply applied, a troche is rubbed on, or else mixed with\r\nsomething softer than itself, or with cerate.\r\n\r\n  [DN] τροχίσχοι.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. XVIII.\r\n\r\nOF MALAGMAS.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _1. A cooling malagma for the hot gout._]\r\n\r\nThese particulars being premised, I shall first subjoin malagmas,\r\nwhich are commonly contrived not with an intention to cool, but to\r\nheat. There is one however, which is cooling, adapted to the hot gout\r\nin the feet. It contains of galls both unripe, and otherwise, of\r\ncoriander-seed, hemlock, poppy-tears, gum, of each an acetabulum, of\r\nwashed cerate, which the Greeks call peplumenon[DO], half a pound.\r\n\r\n  [DO] πεπλυμένον.\r\n\r\nThe other malagmas are mostly heating. But some of them discuss matter,\r\nothers draw it out, which are called epispastica[DP]: most of them are\r\nadapted to particular parts of the body.\r\n\r\n  [DP] ἐπισπαστικὰ.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _2. A drawing malagma._]\r\n\r\nIf matter(35) is to be drawn out, as in a dropsical case, pleurisy,\r\na beginning abscess, and even a moderate suppuration, that is proper,\r\nwhich consists of dry resin, nitre, ammoniacum, galbanum, each p. *.\r\nwax, p. *. Or that, which contains rasile verdigrease, frankincense,\r\neach p. ii. *. Sal ammoniac p. vi. *. copper scales, wax, each p. viii.\r\n*. dry resin p. xii. *. and vinegar a cyathus. The same end is obtained\r\nby the meal of cummin-seed with struthium(36) and honey p. ii. *.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _3. Malagma for the liver._]\r\n\r\nIf the liver is pained, the proper malagma is that, which contains\r\nbalsam-tears p. xii. *. costus, cinnamon, cassia bark, myrrh, saffron,\r\nround cyperus, balsam-seed, Illyrian iris, cardamom, amomum, nard, of\r\neach p. xvi. *. To these is added nard ointment(37), till it be of\r\nthe consistence of cerate. And this must be used, while it is recent:\r\nbut if it be to be kept for some time, turpentine resin p. xvi. *. wax\r\np. x. *. must be beat up with mild wine, and mixed with it.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _4. Malagma for the spleen._]\r\n\r\nBut if the spleen is pained, the bark of that acorn, which the Greeks\r\ncall myrobalanus, and nitre are beat together in equal quantities, and\r\nare sprinkled over with the sharpest vinegar: when it comes to the\r\nconsistence of cerate, it is spread upon a linen cloth first moistened\r\nin cold water, and thus applied, and over it is laid barley meal; but\r\nit ought not to lie there above six hours, lest it waste the spleen;\r\nand it is better to do it twice or thrice.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _5. Lysias’s malagma for several parts._]\r\n\r\nLysias composed a malagma, at once calculated for the liver, and\r\nspleen, and for abscesses, and the scrophula, and parotid swellings,\r\nand the joints, and heels suppurating, or otherwise painful, likewise\r\nto assist the concoction of the stomach, of the following materials:\r\nopopanax, galbanum, resin, of each p. ii. *. ammoniacum, bdellium, wax,\r\nbeef suet, dry iris p. iv. *. with an acetabulum of cachrys(38) and\r\nforty grains of pepper: which being powdered are brought to a proper\r\nconsistence by iris ointment.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _6. Apollophanes’s malagma._]\r\n\r\nThe composition of Apollophanes is calculated for pains of the sides.\r\nIt consists of turpentine resin, soot of frankincense, each p. iv.\r\n*. bdellium, ammoniacum, iris, suet from the kidneys either of veal\r\nor a goat, viscum(39), each p. iv. *. Now this relieves all pains,\r\nmollifies what is hard, and is moderately heating.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _7. Andreas’s malagma._]\r\n\r\nThe malagma of Andreas also has the same effect; it likewise relaxes,\r\ndraws out humour, maturates pus, and when that is ripe, it breaks the\r\nskin, and brings it to cicatrize. It does good applied either to small\r\nor large abscesses; also to pained joints, hips, and feet: it restores\r\ntoo any part, that has been damaged by bruises; softens hard and\r\ninflated præcordia; extracts bones; and in fine is efficacious in every\r\ncase, where heat can be of service. It contains wax p. xi. *. viscum,\r\nsycaminum (which others call sycamore) tears, each p. i. *. pepper both\r\nround and long, ammoniacum thymiama(40), bdellium, Illyrium iris,\r\ncardamom, xylobalsam, male frankincense, myrrh, dry resin, each p. x.\r\n*. pellitory, gnidian berries, aphronitre, sal ammoniac, root of Cretan\r\nbirthwort, root of wild cucumber, liquid resin of turpentine, of each\r\np. xx. *. to these is added a sufficient quantity of iris ointment to\r\nsoften and reduce them to a proper consistence.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _8. Malagma for Polyarchus._]\r\n\r\nThe principal composition for relaxing what is bound, softening what\r\nis hard, and discussing any collection, is that, which is ascribed\r\nto Polyarchus. It contains of long cyperus, cardamom, soot of\r\nfrankincense, amomum, wax, liquid resin, equal parts.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _9. Malagma of Nileus._]\r\n\r\nThere is another by Nileus for the same purposes: of crocomagma(41),\r\nwhich is, as it were, the refuse of saffron p. iv. *. ammoniacum\r\nthymiama, wax, each p. xxx. *. the two first of these are rubbed down\r\nwith vinegar, the wax is melted with oil of roses, and then the whole\r\nis mixed together.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _10. Moschus’s emollient malagma._]\r\n\r\nThe malagma, that passes under the name of Moschus, has only the\r\nproperty of softening what is hard. It contains of galbanum one ounce,\r\nsoot of frankincense p. iii. *. wax, ammoniacum thymiama, each a\r\ntriens, dry pitch p. ii. *. vinegar three heminae.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _11. Medus’s discutient malagma._]\r\n\r\nMedus’s malagma is used to discuss any collection. This contains wax p.\r\niii. *. panaces 1/2 p. *. copper scales, round alum, scissile alum, of\r\neach p. i. *. calcined lead p. i. *. and 1/2.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _12. Panthemus’s malagma._]\r\n\r\nPanthemus for the same intention made use of lime 1/2 p. *. mustard\r\npowdered, fenugreek, alum, each p. i. *. beef suet p. ii. *. and 1/2.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _13. Andreas’s malagma for the scrophula._]\r\n\r\nFor the scrophula I find many malagmas. I believe indeed, that the\r\nmore malignant that distemper is, and the more difficult to discuss,\r\nthe greater number of remedies have been tried; which have succeeded\r\nvariously in different persons. Andreas is the author of the following\r\nmixture: Nettle-seed p. i. *. round pepper, bdellium, galbanum,\r\nammoniacum thymiama, dry resin, of each p. iv. *. liquid resin, wax,\r\npellitory, long pepper, sea spurge-seed, crude sulphur, which is called\r\napyron[DQ], equal parts.\r\n\r\n  [DQ] ἄπυρον, that has not passed the fire.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _14. Mico’s for the same._]\r\n\r\nMico’s malagma is this: of dry lees, vinegar, aphronitre, sal ammoniac,\r\nmustard, cardamom, wild cucumber-root, resin, each p. iv. *. which are\r\nbeat up with mild wine.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _15. Three others._]\r\n\r\nA more expeditious for the same purpose is that, which contains of\r\nviscum, cat’s dung, resin, crude sulphur, equal parts. And another,\r\nin which are of sulphur p. i. *. pyrites-stone p. iv. *. of cummin an\r\nacetabulum. Likewise that, which consists of one part of pyrites, two\r\nof sulphur, and three of turpentine resin.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _16. Malagma of an Arabian for the scrophula, &c._]\r\n\r\nThere is a malagma of a certain Arabian for the scrophula, and\r\nrising tubercles, which are called phymata, which discusses them. It\r\ncontains myrrh, sal ammoniac, frankincense, resin both liquid and dry,\r\ncrocomagma, wax, of each p. i. *. the pyrites-stone p. iv. *. to which\r\nsome add sulphur p. ii. *.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _17. Another for the same._]\r\n\r\nThere is another of service in the scrophula, and in those tubercles,\r\nwhich are with difficulty brought to maturate; and in those, that are\r\ncalled carcinodea[DR], which consists of these things: sulphur p. ii.\r\n*. nitre p. iv. *. myrrh p. vi. *. soot frankincense 1/2 p. *. sal\r\nammoniac p. iii. *. wax p. i. *.\r\n\r\n  [DR] χαρχινωδὴ, cancerous.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _18. Protarchus’s malagma._]\r\n\r\nProtarchus for parotid swellings, and those tubercles, which are called\r\nmelicerides[DS], that is, honey-combs, or phymata, and for malignant\r\nulcers, made this mixture: of pumice, liquid pine resin, soot of\r\nfrankincense, aphronitre, iris, each p. viii. *. with wax p. ix. *. and\r\nto these he added a cyathus and half of oil.\r\n\r\n  [DS] μιλιχηρίδες.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _19. Malagma for a panus, &c._]\r\n\r\nBut against the panus upon its first appearance, which the Greeks call\r\nphygethlon[DT], and any tubercle, which is called phyma, a mixture is\r\nmade of attic ochre, with two parts of flour, and to these, while they\r\nare beat up, honey is now and then dropped in, till it acquire the\r\nconsistence of a malagma.\r\n\r\n  [DT] φύγεθλον.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _20. A malagma against all phymata._]\r\n\r\nThat also discusses all the tubercles, that have the name of phyma,\r\nwhich contains of lime, aphronitre, round pepper, each p. i. *.\r\ngalbanum p. ii. *. salt p. iv. *. which are incorporated with cerate\r\nmade of rose-oil.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _21. Malagma for beginning abscesses._]\r\n\r\nThat malagma suppresses all beginning abscesses, which is composed of\r\ngalbanum, bruised beans, each p. i. *. myrrh, frankincense, bark of\r\ncaper-root, each p. iv. *. And the murex burnt, and reduced to a fine\r\npowder, dropping in now and then a little vinegar, powerfully discusses\r\nall beginning abscesses.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _22. Malagma for blood._]\r\n\r\nBut if in such tumours, too great a quantity of blood is extravasated,\r\nit is proper to use an application, which is also efficacious against\r\ntubercles. It has the following ingredients: bdellium, storax,\r\nammoniacum, galbanum, pine resin both dry and liquid. Also mastich,\r\nfrankincense, iris, of each p. ii. *.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _23. Malagma for cancers, &c._]\r\n\r\nCancers and tubercles are in a good measure eased by this composition:\r\ngalbanum, viscum, ammoniacum, turpentine resin, each p. i. *. beef suet\r\n1/2 p. *. burned lees as great a proportion as may be, without making\r\nit drier than a malagma ought to be.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _24. Malagma for the face._]\r\n\r\nBut if there be a contusion in the face and a livor from an\r\nextravasation of blood, the following composition, applied night and\r\nday, removes it. Birthwort, thapsia(42), of each p. ii. *. bdellium,\r\nstorax, ammoniacum thymiama, galbanum, dry resin, and liquid, resin of\r\nthe mastich-tree, male frankincense, Illyrian iris, wax, of each p. iv.\r\n*. The application of a bean also will do good in the same case.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _25. Opening malagmas._]\r\n\r\nThere are also some malagmas, which by the Greeks are called\r\nanastomotica[DU], because they have the power of opening. Such is that,\r\nwhich is composed of the following things: long pepper, aphronitre, of\r\neach p. ii. *. hedge mustard p. iv. *. which are mixed with honey: they\r\nare also proper for opening scrophulous tumours. Of the same kind with\r\nthis, but stronger, is that, which contains lime p. iv. *. pepper six\r\ngrains, nitre, wax, of each p. x. *. honey p. iii. *. and a hemina of\r\noil.\r\n\r\n  [DU] ἀναστομωτικὰ.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _26. Mico’s relaxing, &c. malagma._]\r\n\r\nThere is one of Mico’s, which is relaxing, opening, and cleansing. It\r\ncontains of bastard sponge, sulphur, nitre, pumice, equal parts; to\r\nthese is added of pitch and wax a sufficient quantity to make it the\r\nconsistence of cerate.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _27. Aristogenes’s malagma for the bones, &c._]\r\n\r\nAristogenes’s malagma for the bones consists of these ingredients:\r\nof sulphur p. i. *. turpentine resin, aphronitre, and the pulp of a\r\nsquil, washed lead(43), each p. ii. *. soot of frankincense p. viii.\r\n*. the mellowest dry figs, beef suet, each p. viii. *. wax p. xii. *.\r\nMacedonian iris p. vi. *. sesamum toasted and acetabulum. And this\r\nmalagma is very agreeable to the nerves and joints.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _28. Euthycleus’s malagma for the joints, &c._]\r\n\r\nThat, which was invented by Euthycleus, is proper for the joints, and\r\nfor all pains, particularly in the bladder, and any contraction of\r\nthe joints from a recent cicatrix, which the Greeks call anchyla[DV].\r\nIt contains soot of frankincense an acetabulum, the same quantity of\r\nresin, galbanum without its stalks an ounce and half, ammoniacum,\r\nbdellium, of each p. *. wax 1/2 p. *----There is also another, which\r\nconsists of iris, ammoniacum, galbanum, nitre, each p. xiv. *. liquid\r\nresin p. vi. *. wax p. xvi. *.\r\n\r\n  [DV] ἀγκύλη.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _29. Sosagoras’s for the same._]\r\n\r\nSosagoras’s malagma for pains of the joints: of calcined lead,\r\npoppy-tears, bark of henbane, storax, hog’s fennel, suet, resin, and\r\nwax, equal parts.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _30. Chrysippus’s._]\r\n\r\nChrysippus also composed one: of liquid resin, sandarach, pepper, each\r\np. xii. * to these a little wax is added.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _31. Ctesiphon’s._]\r\n\r\nCtesiphon’s: of Cretan wax, turpentine resin, the reddest nitre, each\r\n1/2 p. *. three cyathi of oil. But the nitre is first rubbed for three\r\ndays with water dropped in upon it, and boiled with a sextarius of it,\r\ntill all the moisture be consumed.----This composition is also good\r\nfor parotids, tubercles, and the scrophula, and for softening every\r\ncollection of humour.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _32. For the joints._]\r\n\r\nTo the joints one may properly apply a part of a dry fig mixed with\r\ncat-mint; or staveacre without the seeds, with penny-royal.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _33. Ariston’s for the gout in the feet._]\r\n\r\nThe same composition is useful for the gout in the foot. But for that\r\nailment Ariston has also composed one, containing of nard, cinnamon,\r\ncassia, chamaeleon, round cyperus, each p. viii. *. goat’s suet melted\r\nin iris ointment p. xx. *. iris p. i. *. which ought to lie in the\r\nstrongest vinegar for twenty days. The same also discusses recent\r\ntubercles, and all pains.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _34. Theoxenus’s for pained feet._]\r\n\r\nBut for pains of the feet Theoxenus mixed, of kidney suet a third part,\r\nof salt two parts, and applied them spread upon a piece of leather;\r\nthen put over it ammoniacum thymiama dissolved in vinegar.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _35. Numenius’s for the gout, &c._]\r\n\r\nBut Numenius mollified the gout in the feet, and other indurated joints\r\nwith the following composition: southernwood, dry roses, poppy-tears,\r\nof each p. iii. *. turpentine resin p. iv. *. frankincense, aphronitre,\r\neach p. viii. * iris, birthwort, each p. xii. *. wax p. iii. * to these\r\nis added one cyathus of cedria(44), three cyathi of laurel oil(45),\r\nand a sextarius of bitter oil.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _36. Dexius’s malagma for a callus, &c._]\r\n\r\nFor a callus formed upon the joints, Dexius directed the following\r\napplication: of lime, p. iv. *. ceruss, p. viii. *. pine resin xx.\r\n*. pepper thirty grains, wax p. ii. *. And while these are beat up a\r\nhemina of mild wine is poured in.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. XIX.\r\n\r\nOF PLAISTERS.\r\n\r\n\r\nOf plaisters there are none more useful, than those, which are\r\nimmediately applied to bloody wounds; the Greeks call them enaima[DW].\r\nFor these repel an inflammation, unless it be excited by something very\r\nviolent, and even then they diminish its force, and agglutinate wounds,\r\nwhich are not inflamed, and cicatrize them. They consist of medicines\r\nnot fat, and therefore by the Greeks are called alipaina[DX].\r\n\r\n  [DW] ἔναιμα.\r\n\r\n  [DX] ἀλίπαινα.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _1. Barbarium plaister._]\r\n\r\nThe best of these plaisters is that, which is called barbarum. It\r\ncontains of rasile verdigrease(46) p. xii. *. litharge p. xx. *.\r\nalum, dry pitch, dry pine resin, each p. i. *. to which is added of oil\r\nand vinegar each a hemina.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _2. The choacon._]\r\n\r\nThere is another for the same, which is called choacon; it contains of\r\nlitharge p. x. *. dry resin as much. But the litharge is first boiled\r\nin three heminæ of oil. The colour of both these plaisters is black,\r\nwhich generally results from pitch and resin, as the blackest is from\r\nbitumen; from verdigrease, or scales of copper, green; from minium,\r\nred; from ceruss, white.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _3. The basilicon._]\r\n\r\nThere are a very few compositions, in which the variety of the mixture\r\ncauses some different appearance; therefore that also is black, which\r\nis called basilicon. It contains of opopanax p. i. *. galbanum p. ii.\r\n*. pitch and resin, of each p. x. *. half a cyathus of oil.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _4. The smaragdine._]\r\n\r\nBut that, which is very green, is called smaragdine, in which there are\r\nof pine resin. p. iii. *. wax p. i. *. verdigrease 1/2 p. *. flour of\r\nfrankincense p. ii. *. as much oil and vinegar, with which _last_ the\r\nflour and verdigrease are united.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _5. The rufum._]\r\n\r\nThere is also one of a reddish colour, which seems to bring wounds to\r\ncicatrize quickly: it consists of frankincense p. i. *. resin p. ii.\r\n*. copper scales p. iii. *. litharge p. xx. *. wax p. c. *. of oil a\r\nhemina.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _6. The paracolleticon._]\r\n\r\nBesides, there is another, which from agglutinating is called\r\nparacolleticon[DY] It contains bitumen, scissile alum, p. iv. *.\r\nlitharge p. iv. *. and a hemina of old oil.\r\n\r\n  [DY] παρακολλητικὸν.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _7. Philotas’s cephalic plaister._]\r\n\r\nBesides these there are some of the same kind, which, because they\r\nare particularly adapted to fractures of the skull, are by the Greeks\r\ncalled cephalica[DZ]. Philotas’s composition contains of Eretrian\r\nearth, chalcitis, each p. iv. *. myrrh, calcined copper, each p. x.\r\n*. isinglass p. vi. *. rasile verdigrease, round alum, crude misy,\r\nbirthwort, each p. viii. *. copper scales p. xx. *. male frankincense\r\np. ii. *. wax p. i. *. rose and bitter oil three cyathi, and a\r\nsufficient quantity of vinegar for rubbing down all the dry ingredients.\r\n\r\n  [DZ] κηφαλικὰ.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _8. A green one._]\r\n\r\nThere is another for the same purpose green; which consists of calcined\r\ncopper, copper scales, myrrh, isinglass, each p. vi. *. crude misy,\r\nrasile verdigrease, birthwort, round alum, each p. viii. *. wax p. vi.\r\n*. a hemina of oil, and of vinegar a sufficient quantity.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _9. The tetrapharmacum._]\r\n\r\nFor promoting a suppuration there is nothing better than that, which is\r\nvery quickly prepared, and by the Greeks is called tetrapharmacum[EA].\r\nIt contains equal parts of wax, pitch, resin, and beef suet; if the\r\nlast cannot be had, veal suet.\r\n\r\n  [EA] τετραφάρμακον, or consisting of four medicines.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _10. Ennea pharmacum._]\r\n\r\nThere is another for the same intention, which is called ennea\r\npharmacum[EB], which cleanses more; it consists of nine ingredients,\r\nwax, honey, suet, resin, myrrh, rose oil, marrow either of a deer or\r\ncalf, or beef, or œsypum(47), and butter. These also are mixed in\r\nequal quantities.\r\n\r\n  [EB] ἐννεαφάρμακον, of nine medicines.\r\n\r\nBut there are some plaisters, that answer both these intentions at\r\nonce; which, unless the case requires distinct applications for each,\r\nare preferable; otherwise they are worse, and never to be made use of,\r\nbut either when both intentions are proposed together, or when, though\r\nthe plaisters are wanted singly, they are not to be had by themselves.\r\nBut where there is choice, they are to be rejected, and such only\r\napplied as are peculiarly suited to the end to be obtained. For example\r\nI will mention two.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _11. Attallum plaister._]\r\n\r\nThere is then the Attalum plaister for wounds: which contains of copper\r\nscales p. vii. *. soot of frankincense p. xv. *. ammoniacum as much,\r\nliquid turpentine resin p. xxv. *. beef suet the same quantity, three\r\nheminæ of vinegar, a sextarius of oil.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _12. Judæus’s plaister._]\r\n\r\nBut amongst those, which are proper for a fractured skull, some use\r\nthat, which is said to be invented by Judæus. It consists of the\r\nfollowing ingredients: salt p. iv. *. red copper scales, calcined\r\ncopper, each p. xii. *. ammoniacum thymiama, soot of frankincense, dry\r\nresin, each p. vi. *. Colophonian resin, wax, veal suet cured, each p.\r\nxx. *. a cyathus and half of vinegar is added, and less than a cyathus\r\nof oil. What the Greeks call tetherapeumena[EC], we call curata,\r\n_cured_; when for instance from the suet all the little membranes are\r\ncarefully taken away, and so in any other medicine.\r\n\r\n  [EC] τεθεραπευμένα.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _13. Diadaphnidon._]\r\n\r\nThere are also some plaisters greatly celebrated for drawing, which\r\nare likewise distinguished by the name of epispastica[ED]. Such as is\r\nthat, which because bay-berries are among the ingredients, is called\r\ndiadaphnidon[EE]. In it there is turpentine resin p. x. *. nitre, wax,\r\ndry pitch, bay-berries, each p. xx. *. and a little oil. Now as often\r\nas I shall mention a berry or a nut, or any thing of that nature,\r\nit will be proper to know, that before it be weighed, the exterior,\r\npellicle is to be taken from it.\r\n\r\n  [ED] ἐπισπαστικὰ.\r\n\r\n  [EE] διὰ δαφνίδων.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _14. Another._]\r\n\r\nThere is another of the same name, which is also for promoting a\r\nsuppuration. Of veal suet, ammoniacum thymiama, pitch, wax, nitre,\r\nbay-berries, dry resin, birthwort, pellitory, of each equal parts.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _15. Philocrates’s._]\r\n\r\nBesides these there is one of Philocrates: which contains sal ammoniac\r\np. vii. *. birthwort p. viii. *. wax, turpentine resin, soot of\r\nfrankincense, each p. xv. *. litharge p. xxxii. *. To these, that it\r\nmay serve also for promoting a suppuration, are added iris p. iii. *.\r\ngalbanum p. vi. *.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _16. Rhypodes._]\r\n\r\nHowever that is best for drawing, which from its resemblance to sordes,\r\nthe Greeks call rhypodes[EF]. It contains myrrh, saffron, iris,\r\npropolis, bdellium, the heads of pomegranates, scissile and round\r\nalum, misy, chalcitis, boiled copperas(48), opopanax, sal ammoniac,\r\nviscum, each p. iv. *. birthwort p. viii. *. copper scales p. xvi. *.\r\nturpentine resin p. lxxv. *. wax, and suet, either beef or goat’s, each\r\np. c. *.\r\n\r\n  [EF] ῥυπω̃δες.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _17. Hecatæus’s._]\r\n\r\nHecatæus also is the author of a plaister of the same kind, which is\r\nthus composed: galbanum p. ii. *. soot of frankincense p. iv. *. pitch\r\np. v. *. wax and turpentine resin, each p. viii. *. with these a little\r\niris ointment is mixed.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _18. The green Alexandrian._]\r\n\r\nThe green Alexandrian drawing plaister is efficacious for the same\r\npurpose. It contains scissile alum p. viii. *. sal ammoniac p. vii. *.\r\ncopper scales p. xvi. *. myrrh, frankincense, each p. xviii. *. wax\r\np. cl. *. colophonian or pine resin p. cxc. *. a hemina of oil, and a\r\nsextarius of vinegar.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _19. An eating plaister._]\r\n\r\nSome plaisters are eating, which the Greeks call septica[EG], such as\r\nis that, which contains turpentine resin, soot of frankincense, of each\r\np. ii. *. copper scales p. i. *. labdanum p. ii. * the same quantity of\r\nalum, litharge p. iv. *.\r\n\r\n  [EG] σηπτικὰ.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _20. Another for eating, &c._]\r\n\r\nThis plaister also eats away flesh vehemently, and even dissolves\r\nthe bones, and keeps down fungous flesh. It contains litharge,\r\ncopper scales, of each an ounce; nitre that has not felt the fire,\r\nAsian stone, birthwort, of each a sextans, wax, turpentine resin,\r\nfrankincense, old oil, copperas, sal ammoniac, 1/2 p. rasile\r\nverdigrease p. bessis, of squill vinegar a hemina, and a like quantity\r\nof Aminæan wine.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _21. Diogenes’s black plaister._]\r\n\r\nThere are also some calculated against bites; such as the black one of\r\nDiogenes: which contains of bitumen, wax, dry pine resin, each p. xx.\r\n*. litharge p. c. *. of oil a sextarius. Or that, which consists of\r\ncopper scales p. iv. *. ceruss and rasile verdigrease each p. viii. *.\r\nammoniacum p. xii. *. wax, pine resin, each p. xxv. *. litharge p. c.\r\n*. of oil a sextarius. Or that, which is composed of copper scales p.\r\nxiv. *. galbanum p. vi. *. ceruss and rasile verdigrease, each p. viii.\r\n*. ammoniacum p. xii. *. wax, pine resin, of each p. lv. *. with these\r\nthe litharge is boiled.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _22. Red Ephesian plaister._]\r\n\r\nThere is a red plaister of the same virtues, which is called Ephesian.\r\nIt contains turpentine resin p. ii. *. galbanum p. iv. *. Sinopian\r\nminium p, vi. *. soot of frankincense p. vi. *. wax p. viii. *.\r\nlitharge, p. lvi. *. old oil a hemina.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _23. Another._]\r\n\r\nLikewise that which consists of the following materials; copper scales,\r\nsoot of frankincense, of each p. iv *. galbanum p. vi. *. sal ammoniac\r\np. xii. z. *. wax p. xxv. *. with three heminæ of oil. These also are\r\nproper applications for other recent wounds.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _24. A white lenient plaister._]\r\n\r\nThere are also white lenient plaisters, by the Greeks, _from their\r\ncolour_, called leuca[EH], generally calculated for slight wounds, and\r\nespecially those of old men: such as is that, which contains of ceruss\r\np. lii. *. veal suet cured and wax, each p. lviii. *. three heminæ of\r\noil, with which the ceruss is boiled up.\r\n\r\n  [EH] λευκὰ.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _25. Elephantine plaister._]\r\n\r\nAnother, which consists of ceruss p. xx. *. wax p. lv. *. a hemina of\r\noil, and a sextarius of water. Now as often as these are added, to\r\nceruss or litharge, we may take it for granted, that they are to be\r\nboiled with them. This last composition is very white, and therefore it\r\nis called elephantine.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _26. A lenient plaister._]\r\n\r\nThere are also some lenient plaisters, which the Greeks commonly call\r\nlipara[EI], as that which contains minium p. iv.*. litharge, p. xxv. *.\r\nwax and hog’s lard, each p. xxxv. *. and the yolks of four eggs.\r\n\r\n  [EI] λιπαρὰ.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _27. Another._]\r\n\r\nAnother composition of the same kind: wax, turpentine resin, of each\r\np. v. *. ceruss p. viii. *. litharge, dross of lead (scoria molybdi\r\nthe Greeks call it) each p. x. *. cicine(49) and myrtle oil, each the\r\nthird part of a hemina.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _28. Archagathus’s._]\r\n\r\nAnother, which is said to be invented by Archagathus: burnt misy,\r\ncalcined copper, each p. iv. *. burnt(50) ceruss p. viii. *.\r\nturpentine resin p. x. *. litharge p. vi. *.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _29. Another for the same purpose._]\r\n\r\nFor the same purpose: litharge, wax, hog’s lard, of each p. xxvii. *.\r\nboiled yolks of eggs, with a hemina of rose oil. Or this composition:\r\ncerate made of myrtle oil three parts, hog’s lard a fourth part, a\r\nlittle lead dross. Or the following composition; of litharge half a\r\npound boiled with a hemina of oil, and a like quantity of sea water,\r\ntill it cease to bubble, with the addition of a little wax. Or this:\r\nequal parts of wax, suet, antimony, litharge, and ceruss.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. XX.\r\n\r\nOF TROCHES.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _1. Troche for agglutinating._]\r\n\r\nTroches also have different virtues. For there are some adapted to\r\nagglutinate and heal recent wounds: such is that, which contains\r\nchalcitis, misy, aphro-nitre, flower of copper, galls, scissile alum\r\nmoderately burnt, of each p. i. *. calcined copper, the heads of\r\npomegranates, each p. iii. *. This should be diluted with vinegar, and\r\nso laid on, when a wound is to be agglutinated. But if it be a nervous\r\nor muscular part, it is better to mix it with cerate, so as to have a\r\nninth part of the latter with eight of the other.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _2. Another._]\r\n\r\nAnother for the same purpose. It consists of the following materials:\r\nbitumen, scissile alum, of each p. i. *. calcined copper p. iv. *.\r\nlitharge p. xi. *. and a sextarius of oil.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _3. The sphragis of Polybus._]\r\n\r\nBut that of Polybus(51) is by far the most celebrated: it is called\r\nsphragis[EJ]. Which contains of scissile alum p. iv. *. copperas p. ii.\r\n*. myrrh p. v. *. aloes a like quantity; the heads of pomegranates, ox\r\ngall, each p. vi. *. which being rubbed together, are incorporated with\r\naustere wine.\r\n\r\n  [EJ] σφραγὶς.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _4. Troche for foul ulcers._]\r\n\r\nFor foul ulcers, and blackness in the ears, nose, obscene parts, and\r\ninflammation in any of these places: of chrysocolla p. i. *. copperas,\r\nscissile alum, each p. ii. *. bark of winter cherry p. iv. *. minium p.\r\nvi. *. litharge p. xii. *. ceruss p. xvi. *. these are compounded with\r\nvinegar, and diluted when used.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _5. Andro’s troche._]\r\n\r\nAndro’s is for an inflamed uvula, for foulness in the obscene parts,\r\nor gangrenes in the same; of galls, copperas, myrrh, each p. i. *.\r\nbirthwort, scissile alum, each p. ii. *. heads of pomegranates p. xxv.\r\n*. compounded with passum, and when they are to be used, diluted with\r\nvinegar or wine, according as the disorder, which is to be cured, is\r\nmore or less violent.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _6. A troche for fissures of the anus, &c._]\r\n\r\nFor fissures in the anus, or an effusion of blood from the hæmorrhoidal\r\nveins, or a gangrene, the following is of peculiar efficacy; of\r\nverdigrease p. ii. *. myrrh p. iv. *. gum p. viii. *. frankincense p.\r\nxii. *. antimony, poppy tears, acacia, each p. xvi. *. which are both\r\nrubbed down with wine, and when used, diluted with the same liquor.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _7. Troche for expelling a stone from the bladder._]\r\n\r\nThis composition seems proper to expel a stone out of the bladder along\r\nwith the urine: equal parts of cassia, saffron, myrrh, costus, nard,\r\ncinnamon, liquorice root, balsam, hypericum are powdered; then mild\r\nwine is dropped in, and the troches are formed. Each may contain p. i.\r\n*. and one of these may be swallowed every day in the morning fasting.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. XXI.\r\n\r\nOF PESSARIES.\r\n\r\n\r\nThese three kinds of compositions, that is, malagmas, plaisters, and\r\ntroches, are extensive and various in their uses. But there are other\r\nthings also useful: as those, which are applied below to females: the\r\nGreeks call them pessi[EK]. The manner of them is this: the composition\r\nis received in soft wool, and this wool put into the vagina.\r\n\r\n  [EK] πεσσοὶ.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _1. Pessary for evacuating blood._]\r\n\r\nFor evacuating blood, to two of the small kind of figs called\r\ncauneæ(52) is added nitre p. i. *. Or the seed of garlick\r\nis powdered, and a little myrrh added and mixed with susine\r\nointment(53). Or the pulp of a wild cucumber is diluted in woman’s\r\nmilk.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _2. For softening the womb._]\r\n\r\nTo soften the womb, the yolk of an egg, and fenugreek, and rose oil,\r\nand saffron are mixed together. Or of elaterium p. iii. *. as much\r\nsalt, and stavesacre p. vi. *. are incorporated with honey.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _3. Boethus’s for the same._]\r\n\r\nThere is another invented by Boethus, which contains saffron,\r\nturpentine resin, each p. iv. *. myrrh p. iii. *. rose oil p. i. *.\r\nveal suet p. iii. *. wax p. ii. *. mixed together.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _4. Numenius’s for an inflammation._]\r\n\r\nThe best composition against an inflammation of the womb, is that of\r\nNumenius, which contains saffron p. iii. *. wax p. i. *. butter p.\r\nviii. *. goose fat p. xii. *. two boiled yolks of eggs, with less than\r\na cyathus of rose oil.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _5. For expelling a dead fœtus._]\r\n\r\nIf a fœtus has died within the womb, that it may be the more easily\r\nexpelled, the bark of pomegranates must be rubbed down with water, and\r\nthen made use of.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _6. For hysterick fits._]\r\n\r\nIf a woman from an hysterick disorder is subject to fits, snails\r\ntogether with their shells must be burnt and powdered, and then honey\r\nadded to them.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _7. For conception._]\r\n\r\nIf a woman does not conceive(54), lions fat must be softened with\r\nrose oil.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. XXII.\r\n\r\nMEDICINES USED EITHER IN A DRY FORM, OR MIXED WITH LIQUIDS.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _1. Powder for fungous flesh._]\r\n\r\nThere are some mixtures of medicines made use of dry without being\r\nbrought to any consistence, which we sprinkle on, or mix with some\r\nliquid, and lay them on. Such as that for eating down fungous flesh,\r\nwhich contains of copper scales, soot of frankincense, each p. i. *.\r\nverdigrease p. ii. *. Now this same composition with honey cleanses\r\nulcers; and with wax fills them up. Also, if misy, galls, and cadmia\r\nbe mixed in equal proportions, they consume the flesh; and these may\r\neither be sprinkled on dry(55), or brought to a consistence and\r\nspread on.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _2. For restraining putrid flesh._]\r\n\r\nHoney mixed either with lentils, or with horehound, or with olive\r\nleaves first boiled in wine, restrains putrid flesh, and does not\r\nsuffer it to spread, and is gently corrosive. Also mellilot boiled in\r\nmulse, and then rubbed small. Or lime with cerate. Or bitter almonds\r\nwith a third part of their quantity of garlick, and a little saffron\r\nadded to them. Or that, which contains litharge p. vi. *. burnt ox\r\nhorn p. xii. *. myrtle oil and wine, each three cyathi. Or that, which\r\nconsists of the following things: the flowers of pomegranate, copperas,\r\naloes, of each p. ii. *. scissile allum, frankincense, each p. iv.\r\n*. galls p. viii. *. birthwort p. x. *. The following is stronger,\r\nand even caustic; orpiment with chalcitis, and either nitre, or lime,\r\nor burnt paper. Also salt with vinegar. Or that composition, which\r\ncontains chalcitis, pomegranate tops, aloes of each p. ii. *. scissile\r\nalum, frankincense, each p. iv. *. galls p. viii. *. birthwort p.\r\nx. *. and a sufficient quantity of honey to bring them to a proper\r\nconsistence. Or cantharides, sulphur, of each p. i. *. darnel p.\r\niii. *. with the addition of as much liquid pitch as will keep them\r\ntogether. Or even chalcitis mixed with resin and rue: or diphryges with\r\nthe same resin; or stavesacre with liquid pitch. There is the same\r\nproperty in burnt lees of wine, and equal parts of lime and nitre. Or\r\nscissile alum p. i. *. frankincense, sandarach, nitre, each p. i. *.\r\ngalls p. viii. *. birthwort p. x. *. and a sufficient quantity of honey.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _3. Hera’s composition._]\r\n\r\nThere is also a composition of Hera’s, which contains myrrh, chalcitis\r\nof each p. ii. *. aloes, frankincense, scissile alum, each p. iv. *.\r\nbirthwort, unripe galls, each p. viii.*. pomegranate bark powdered p.\r\nxx. *.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _4. Judæus’s._]\r\n\r\nThere is likewise one by Judæus: in which are two parts of lime, and a\r\nthird of the reddest nitre; which are mixed with the urine of a young\r\nboy, till they be of the consistence of strigment. But the part, upon\r\nwhich this is spread, must be moistened now and then.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _5. Jollas’s._]\r\n\r\nBut Jollas mixed of burnt paper, sandarach, each p. i. *. lime p. ii.\r\n*. and the same quantity of orpiment.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _6. For an hæmorrhage._]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _7. For cicatrizing ulcers._]\r\n\r\nBut if there is blood discharged from that membrane, which covers the\r\nbrain, the yolk of an egg ought to be burnt, powdered, and sprinkled\r\nupon it. If the hæmorrhage is from any other part, orpiment, copper\r\nscales, of each p. i. *. sandarach p. ii. *. burnt marble(56) p. iv.\r\n*. ought to be sprinkled on. The same things also resist a gangrene. To\r\nbring on a cicatrix, copper scales, soot of frankincense, of each p.\r\nii. *. lime p. iv. *. p. The same mixture also keeps down fungous flesh.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _8. Timæus’s for the ignis sacer._]\r\n\r\nTimæus made use of the following composition for the ignis sacer(57)\r\nand a gangrene; of myrrh p. ii. *. frankincense, copperas, each p. iii.\r\n*. sandarach, orpiment, copper scales, each p. iv. *. galls p. vi. *.\r\nburnt ceruss p. viii. *. These have the same effect whether sprinkled\r\non dry, or mixed with honey.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Sternutatory medicines._]\r\n\r\nSneezings are excited by putting into the nose either white hellebore,\r\nor struthium. Or this mixture: of pepper, white hellebore each p. iii.\r\n*. castor p. i. *. aphronitre p. ii. *. struthium p. iii. *.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Gargarisms._]\r\n\r\nGargarisms are used either to alleviate, or to repel, or to evacuate.\r\nMilk cream of ptisan, or bran, are lenients. A decoction either of\r\nlentils, or roses, or brambles, or quinces, or dates, are repellent.\r\nMustard and pepper are evacuants.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. XXIII.\r\n\r\nOF ANTIDOTES, AND THEIR USES.\r\n\r\n\r\nAntidotes, though seldom wanted, are sometimes extremely necessary,\r\nbecause they relieve in the most dangerous cases. They are properly\r\nexhibited, when bodies are bruised either by blows, or by falling from\r\na height, or in pains of the bowels, sides, fauces, and more internal\r\nparts. But their principal use is against poisons either injected into\r\nour bodies by bites, or received with meat or drink.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _1. Antidote._]\r\n\r\nThere is one, which contains poppy tears p. *. z. acorum,\r\nmalobathrum(58) p. v. *. Illyrian iris, gum, of each p. ii. *.\r\nanise p. iii. *. Gallican nard, dry rose leaves, cardamom, each p.\r\niv. *. parsley p. *. iii. z. trefoil p. v. *. black cassia(59),\r\nsilis, bdellium, balsam fruit, white poppy seed, each p. *. z. storax\r\np. *. v. z. myrrh, opopanax, Syrian nard, male frankincense, juice\r\nof hypocistis, each p. vi. *. castor p. vi. *. costus, white pepper,\r\ngalbanum, turpentine resin, saffron, flower of round cyperus, each p.\r\nvi. *. z. liquorice p. viii. *. z. these are incorporated with honey or\r\npassum.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _2. Antidote called ambrosia._]\r\n\r\nAnother antidote, which Zopyrus is said to have compounded for king\r\nPtolemy, and called it ambrosia, consists of the following things:\r\ncostus, male frankincense, of each p. v. *. white pepper p. *. z.\r\nflower of round cyperus p. ii. *. cinnamon p. iii. *. black cassia p.\r\niv. *. Cilician saffron p. *. iv. z. the myrrh called stacte(60) p.\r\nv. *. Indian nard p. *. v. z. which being powdered separately, are\r\nincorporated with boiled honey: then when it is used, the bigness of an\r\nEgyptian bean must be diluted in a draught of wine.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _3. Mithridates’s antidote._]\r\n\r\nBut the most celebrated is that of Mithridates: by taking which every\r\nday, this king is said to have rendered his body secure against the\r\ndanger or poisons. It contains the following things: of costus p. *.\r\nz. acorus p. v. *. hystericum, cummin, sagapenum, juice of acacia,\r\nIllyrian iris, cardamom, each p. ii. * anise p. iii. * Gallican nard,\r\ngentian-root, dry rose leaves, each p. iv. *. poppy tears, parsley,\r\neach p. *. iv. z. cassia, siler, darnel, long pepper, each p. vi. *.\r\nstorax p. *. v. z. castor, frankincense, juice of hypocistis, myrrh,\r\nopopanax, each p. vi. *. malobathrum leaves p. vi. *. flower of round\r\ncyperus, turpentine resin, galbanum, seed of Cretan carrot, each p.\r\n*. v. z. nard, opobalsam, each p. *. vi. z. treacle mustard p. *. vi.\r\npontic root(61) p. vii. *. saffron, ginger, cinnamon, each p. *.\r\nviii. These are powdered and mixed with honey, and against poison the\r\nbigness of a sweet almond is given in wine. In other disorders of the\r\nbody, according to their violence, either the bigness of an Egyptian\r\nbean, or a vetch, will be sufficient.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. XXIV.\r\n\r\nOF ACOPA.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Acopon for the nerves._]\r\n\r\nAcopa(62) are useful to the nerves. Such is that, which contains\r\nflower of round cyperus p. *. ii. z. z. costus, long cyperus, bay\r\nberries, ammoniacum, cardamom, each p. *. iv. z. myrrh, calcined\r\ncopper, each p. vii. *. Illyrian iris, wax, each p. iv. *. Alexandrian\r\nreed, round cyperus, calambac wood, xylo-balsam, each p. xviii. *. suet\r\np. i. *. iris ointment a cyathus.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Another called elæodes._]\r\n\r\nThere is another, which they call elæodes[EL]; it is made in this\r\nmanner: of wax p. *. z. oil a like quantity, and of turpentine resin\r\nthe bulk of a walnut; these are boiled together: then being poured into\r\na mortar, are rubbed, and an acetabulum of the best honey is gradually\r\ndropped into it, then three cyathi of iris ointment and of rose oil.\r\n\r\n  [EL] ἐλαιω̃̃δες.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Of enchrista. One for cleansing and filling ulcers._]\r\n\r\nThe Greeks call liquids, that are daubed on, by the name of\r\nenchrista[EM]. Such as is that for cleansing and incarning ulcers,\r\nespecially amongst nerves. It consists of a mixture of equal parts\r\nof butter, veal marrow, veal suet, goose fat, wax, honey, turpentine\r\nresin, rose and cicine oil. These are all melted separately, then\r\nmixed while they are liquid, and afterwards rubbed together. And this\r\ncomposition is indeed more cleansing: but it would be more emollient,\r\nif instead of the rose oil, that of cyprus be infused.\r\n\r\n  [EM] ἔγχριστα.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _For the ignis sacer._]\r\n\r\nFor the ignis sacer: of litharge p. vi. *. ox-horn burnt p. ii. *.\r\nthese are beat up together, and there is added alternately wine, and\r\nmyrtle wine, till three cyathi of each be used.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. XXV.\r\n\r\nOF CATAPOTIA.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _1. Anodyne catapotium for concoction._]\r\n\r\nThere are catapotia of various kinds, and composed for different\r\nintentions. They call those anodyna[EN], which mitigate pain by sleep:\r\nwhich it is not fit to use, unless there be a very great necessity. For\r\nthey consist of medicines strong and ungrateful to the stomach. Yet\r\nthat even promotes concoction, which contains poppy tears, galbanum,\r\nof each p. i. *. myrrh, castor, pepper, each p. ii. Of these it is\r\nsufficient to swallow the bigness of a vetch.\r\n\r\n  [EN] ἀνώδυνα.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _2. Another stronger._]\r\n\r\nAnother, which is more powerful to promote sleep, but worse for the\r\nstomach, consists of the following ingredients. Of mandrake p. *. z.\r\nseeds of smallage and henbane, each p. iv. *. which are rubbed down\r\nwith wine. The same quantity of this, as was directed of the other, is\r\na plentiful dose.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _3. A quieting catapotium for pains of the head, &c._]\r\n\r\nIf there be pains of the head, or ulcers, or a lippitude, or tooth-ach,\r\nor difficulty of breathing, or pains of the intestines, or inflammation\r\nof the womb, or the hip, or a pain in the liver, spleen, or side, or if\r\na woman falls into hysterick fits, and loses her speech, a catapotium\r\nof the following kind removes the pain by sleep. Sil(63), acorum,\r\nseed of wild rue, each p. ii. *. castor, cinnamon, each p. ii. *.\r\npoppy-tears, root of panaces, dry mandrake fruit, flower of round\r\ncyperus, of each p. ii. *. pepper lvi. grains. These being powdered\r\nseparately, are again all rubbed together, dropping in now and then\r\npassum, till they acquire the consistence of sordes. A little of this\r\nis either swallowed, or diluted in water, and given to drink.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _4. Another of more general use._]\r\n\r\nMoreover a handful of wild poppy, when it is just ripe for gathering\r\nthe tear, is put into a vessel, and upon it is infused a sufficient\r\nquantity of water to cover it, and thus it is boiled. When this handful\r\nhas been well boiled, let it be squeezed and thrown away; and with the\r\nliquor let an equal quantity of passum be mixed, and let them boil\r\ntogether, till it be as thick as sordes. When it has cooled, it is made\r\ninto catapotia of the bigness of our bean, which have an extensive use.\r\nFor they both procure sleep, either taken alone, or given in water,\r\nand with the addition of a little juice of rue and passum mitigate\r\near-aches: and dissolved in wine they stop a dysentery: and mixed with\r\ncerate made of rose oil, to which a little saffron is added, they\r\nrestrain an inflammation of the womb. And spread upon the forehead with\r\nwater, they stop the flux of gum to the eyes.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _5. For a pain of the womb._]\r\n\r\nAgain, if a pain of the womb prevent sleep, a mixture is made of\r\nsaffron p. ii. *. anise, myrrh, each p. i. *. poppy tears p. iv. *.\r\nhemlock seed p. viii. *. and these incorporated with old wine, and the\r\nbigness of a lupin is diluted with three cyathi of water. But this is\r\ndangerous to give in a fever.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _6. Catapotium for healing the liver._]\r\n\r\nFor healing the liver, of nitre p. *. z. saffron, myrrh, Gallican nard,\r\neach p. i. *. are mixed with honey, and the bigness of an Egyptian bean\r\nserves for a dose.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _7. For pains in the sides._]\r\n\r\nFor removing pains of the sides, equal parts of pepper, birthwort,\r\nnard, and myrrh are mixed together.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _8. Of the thorax._]\r\n\r\nFor pains of the thorax, of nard p. i. *. frankincense, cassia, each\r\np. iii. *. myrrh, cinnamon, each p. vi. *. saffron p. viii. turpentine\r\nresin a quadrans, honey three heminæ.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _9. Athenio’s for a cough._]\r\n\r\nFor a cough is that of Athenio: of myrrh, pepper, each p. i. *. castor,\r\npoppy tears, each p. i. *. which are bruised separately, and afterwards\r\nmixed, and two catapotia of the bulk of our bean are given in the\r\nmorning, and two, when the patient is going to sleep at night.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _10. Heraclides’s anodyne catapotium for a cough._]\r\n\r\nBut if a cough prevents sleep, that of Heraclides the Tarentine is\r\ncalculated for both disorders: of saffron p. i. *. cinnamon, castor,\r\npoppy tears, each p. i. *. myrrh, long pepper, costus, galbanum, each\r\np. *. z.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _11. Catapotium for foul ulcers in the fauces._]\r\n\r\nBut if ulcers in the fauces of patients labouring under a cough require\r\nto be cleansed, of panaces, myrrh, turpentine resin, each p. v. *.\r\ngalbanum p. *. z. hyssop p. *. z. are to be rubbed together, and to\r\nthese a hemina of honey is added, and as much as can be taken upon the\r\nfinger must be swallowed.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _12. The colice of Cassius._]\r\n\r\nThe colice of Cassius consists of the following ingredients: of\r\nsaffron, anise, castor, each p. iii. *. parsley p. iv. *. pepper both\r\nlong and round, each p. v. *. poppy-tears, round cyperus, myrrh, nard,\r\neach p. vi. *. which are incorporated with honey. And this may be both\r\nswallowed alone, and taken in warm water.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _13. For expelling a dead fœtus._]\r\n\r\nA draught of water mixed with sal ammoniac p. i. *. or dittany of Crete\r\np. i. *. expels a dead fœtus or the secundines.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _14. To forward labour._]\r\n\r\nTo women in labour hedge mustard ought to be given in tepid wine, when\r\nthey are fasting.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _15. For the voice._]\r\n\r\nThe voice is assisted by p. i. *. of frankincense given in two cyathi\r\nof wine.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _16. For a dysury._]\r\n\r\nAgainst a difficulty of urine: of long pepper, castor, myrrh, galbanum,\r\npoppy tears, saffron, costus, each one ounce, storax, turpentine resin,\r\nof each a sextans, wormwood, honey, a cyathus. Of these the bigness of\r\nan Egyptian bean ought to be given in the morning, and after supper.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _17. The composition of arteriace._]\r\n\r\nArteriace is made in this manner: of cassia, iris, cinnamon, nard,\r\nmyrrh, frankincense, each p. i. *. saffron, p. i. *. pepper thirty\r\ngrains, are boiled in three sextarii of passum, till they acquire the\r\nconsistence of honey. Or saffron, myrrh, frankincense, of each p. i.\r\n*. are mixed with the same quantity of passum, and boiled in the same\r\nmanner. Or three heminæ of the same passum are boiled, till a drop of\r\nit grows hard; and p. i. *. of powdered cassia is added to it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. XXVI.\r\n\r\nOF FIVE DIFFERENT KINDS OF DISORDERS INCIDENT TO THE BODY; AND OF THE\r\nNATURE, SYMPTOMS, AND CURE OF WOUNDS.\r\n\r\n\r\nHaving explained the virtues of medicines, I shall next consider five\r\ndifferent kinds of disorders, to which the body is incident. When it is\r\nhurt externally, as in wounds. When any part is corrupted internally,\r\nas in a gangrene. When any thing grows within some part, as the stone\r\nin the bladder. When any part is preternaturally enlarged, as a vein,\r\nwhich swelling is called a varix. Lastly, when somewhat is deficient,\r\nor maimed. In some of these medicines, in others manual operations\r\nare most useful. Deferring the consideration of the disorders, which\r\nchiefly require manual operations, I shall now treat of such, as stand\r\nmostly in need of medicines. And I shall divide this part of medicine\r\nin the same manner as the former, and first speak of those, which may\r\nhappen in any part of the body; next of these, which attack certain\r\nparts. I shall begin with wounds.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Rules for the conduct of the physician._]\r\n\r\nNow a physician should above all things know, what are incurable, what\r\ndifficult to cure, and what more easy. For it is the part of a prudent\r\nman first, not to undertake one, whose case is desperate, lest he\r\nappear to have killed him, whom his own destiny has destroyed. Next,\r\nin a case of great danger, but not quite desperate, to discover to the\r\nfriends of the patient, that it is a matter of difficulty: that if the\r\nmalady should prevail against the art, he may neither seem to have\r\nbeen ignorant himself, nor to have deceived them. But as this is the\r\nproper conduct for a prudent person, so on the contrary it is the part\r\nof a quack to exaggerate a small matter, that he may appear to have\r\nperformed the greater cure. Where a case is easy, it is reasonable that\r\nthe physician by a free declaration of its easiness be obliged to the\r\ngreater diligence and circumspection; that what is in itself small may\r\nnot by his negligence become more considerable.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Incurable wounds._]\r\n\r\nA person cannot be preserved, when the basis of the brain, or the\r\nheart, or the gullet, or the portæ of the liver, or the spinal marrow\r\nis wounded; or when the middle of the lungs, or the jejunum, or smaller\r\nintestine, or stomach, or kidneys are wounded; or when the large veins\r\nor arteries about the throat are cut through.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Wounds difficult to cure._]\r\n\r\nThe cure is difficult in such as are wounded either in any part of the\r\nlungs, or the thick part of the liver, or the membrane that contains\r\nthe brain, or in the spleen, or womb, or bladder, or any intestine, or\r\nthe diaphragm. Such also are in a very dangerous situation, in whom the\r\npoint of a weapon has penetrated as far as the large blood vessels,\r\nthat lie deep in the arm-pits and hams. And all wounds are dangerous,\r\nwherever there are large blood-vessels, because they may exhaust a\r\nperson by the profusion of blood. And this happens not only in the\r\narm-pits and hams, but likewise in the veins, which go to the anus and\r\ntesticles. Besides these, any wound in the arm-pits, or the inside\r\nof the thighs, or in any cavity, or between the fingers(15)is bad.\r\nAlso by which a muscle, or nerve, or artery, or membrane, or bone, or\r\ncartilage, is hurt.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Safe wounds._]\r\n\r\nA wound in the flesh is safest of all, and these again from their\r\nsituation are either worse or better. But a wound when large is\r\ndangerous from its size.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _The nature and figure of wounds._]\r\n\r\nThe nature of the wound also and its figure make some difference; for\r\nwhen a part is both cut and bruised, it is worse than when it is only\r\ncut asunder; so that it is better to be wounded by a sharp weapon, than\r\na blunt one. And that wound is worse, out of which any substance is\r\ncut, or where the flesh is carried off on one part, and hangs on the\r\nother. In general, those wounds are the worst, that are crooked: and\r\nthose safest that are of a straight direction. And then, the nearer the\r\nwound approaches to the first or second of these forms, it is more or\r\nless dangerous.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Consideration of the age, constitution, and season._]\r\n\r\nMoreover the age, constitution, the way of life _of the patient_,\r\nand the season of the year, are of some importance: for a boy or a\r\nyouth recovers more easily than one that is older; the strong than\r\nthe infirm; one, that is neither too slender nor too plethoric, than\r\none, that is on either of these extremes; one of a sound than one of\r\na corrupt habit; one, that takes exercise, than an indolent person;\r\nthe sober and temperate than one given to wine and venery. Again, the\r\nmost convenient season of the year for curing a wound is the spring; or\r\nat least when it is neither hot nor cold: for both excessive heat and\r\nintense cold are prejudicial to wounds; but most of all an alternate\r\nchange of these: and for that reason the autumn is very hurtful.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Of wounds of the internal parts._]\r\n\r\nMost wounds are exposed to our view: but there are some, of which we\r\njudge from the situation of the parts, which we explained elsewhere,\r\nwhen we demonstrated the position of the internal parts. Nevertheless,\r\nbecause some of these lie superficial, and it makes a difference,\r\nwhether a wound be in the surface, or has penetrated deeper; it is\r\nnecessary to mention the appearances, by which we may know what is\r\nhurt within; and from which we are either to hope or despair.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Symptoms of the heart being wounded._]\r\n\r\nWhen the heart is wounded, there is a great effusion of blood, the\r\npulse is languid, the skin very pale, cold sweats with a bad smell\r\ncome on, the same as in sickness: the extremities grow cold, and death\r\nquickly follows.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Of the lungs._]\r\n\r\nWhen the lungs are wounded, there is a difficulty of breathing; frothy\r\nblood is discharged from the mouth, and red blood from the wound; also\r\nalong with the latter the air issues with a noise; the patient has an\r\ninclination to lie upon the wound; some start up without any reason.\r\nMany when they are lying upon the wound, are able to speak: if upon\r\nanother part, they lose that faculty.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Of the liver._]\r\n\r\nThe symptoms of a wounded liver are these: there is a great effusion of\r\nblood under the right side of the præcordia; the præcordia are drawn\r\nbackward towards the spine; there is a pleasure in lying upon the\r\nbelly; there are prickings and pains reaching as far as the clavicle\r\nand the broad bone of the shoulder, that is joined to it; to these\r\nthere is sometimes added also a bilious vomiting.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Of the kidneys._]\r\n\r\nWhen the kidneys are wounded, the pain reaches to the groin and\r\ntesticles; the urine is made with difficulty; and it is either bloody,\r\nor grumous blood is voided.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Of the spleen._]\r\n\r\nBut when the spleen is wounded, black blood issues out from the left\r\nside; the præcordia and stomach on the same side grow hard; a great\r\nthirst ensues; and a pain strikes up to the clavicle, as when the liver\r\nis wounded.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Of the womb._]\r\n\r\nBut when the womb is wounded, there is a pain in the groin, and hips,\r\nand inside of the thighs; the blood is partly discharged by the wound,\r\npartly by the vagina; and a bilious vomiting follows. Some women lose\r\ntheir speech; some are delirious; others sensible, but complain, that\r\nthey are tormented with a pain of their nerves and eyes: and when\r\ndying, have the same symptoms, as attend a wounded heart.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Of the brain or its membrane._]\r\n\r\nIf the brain or its membrane has received a wound, blood is discharged\r\nby the nose, in some also by the ears and generally a bilious vomiting\r\nfollows. The senses of some are impaired, and they do not perceive when\r\nthey are called upon: the countenance of others is fierce; and their\r\neyes roll different ways, as in a palsy; and commonly on the third or\r\nfifth day a delirium comes on. Many are likewise convulsed. Before\r\ndeath most of them tear the bandages, with which their head is bound\r\nup, and expose the naked wound to the cold.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Of the gullet._]\r\n\r\nWhen the gullet is wounded, a hiccough and bilious vomiting follow; if\r\nany meat or drink has been taken, it is quickly returned; the pulse\r\ngrows languid; thin sweats come on, in which the extremities grow cold.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Of the stomach and jejunum, and other intestines._]\r\n\r\nThe signs of a wound in the jejunum and stomach are the same; for\r\nthe food and drink pass through the wound: the præcordia grow hard;\r\nsometimes bile is vomited. Only it must be observed, that the jejunum\r\nis situated lower than the stomach. When the other intestines are\r\nwounded, they emit either excrement, or its smell.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Of the spinal marrow._]\r\n\r\nWhen the spinal marrow is cut through, there follows either a palsy or\r\nconvulsions; the patient becomes insensible; and after some time, the\r\nlower parts discharge involuntarily either seed, or urine, or excrement.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Of the diaphragm._]\r\n\r\nBut if the diaphragm is wounded, the præcordia are drawn upward; there\r\nis a pain in the spine, an oppression of the breath, and a discharge of\r\nfrothy blood.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Of the bladder._]\r\n\r\nWhen the bladder is wounded, the groin is pained, there is a tension of\r\nthe parts immediately above the pubes; instead of urine comes blood;\r\nand the urine is discharged at the wound; the stomach is affected, so\r\nthat the patients either vomit bile, or have a hiccough; a coldness\r\nseizes them, and after that death.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Of the discharge from wounds and ulcers._]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Blood, sanies, and pus._]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Ichor._]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Melicera._]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Elæodes._]\r\n\r\nThese things being known, there still remain some other particulars to\r\nbe observed relating to the wounds and ulcers, which we are to treat\r\nof. From wounds then and ulcers are discharged blood, sanies, and pus.\r\nBlood is known to every one. Sanies is thinner than blood, unequally\r\nthick, glutinous, and coloured. Pus is very thick and white, also more\r\nglutinous than either blood or sanies. Now blood is discharged from a\r\nrecent wound, or one that is just healing: sanies appears betwixt these\r\ntimes: pus in an ulcer beginning to heal. Further, both sanies and pus\r\nare distinguished into several species by Greek names; for there is\r\none kind of sanies, which is called ichor[EO], another melicera[EP].\r\nThere is also a species of pus called elæodes[EQ]. Ichor is thin, of\r\na whitish colour, and proceeds from a bad ulcer, and especially where\r\na nerve has been hurt, and an inflammation has followed. Melicera is\r\nthicker, more glutinous, whitish, and somewhat resembling white honey:\r\nthis also is discharged from malignant ulcers, where the nerves about\r\nthe joints are hurt; and amongst the joints principally from the knees.\r\nElæodes is thin, whitish, somewhat unctuous, in colour and fatness not\r\nunlike to white oil; and appears in large ulcers, that are healing. Now\r\nblood is bad that is either too thin or too thick, in colour either\r\nlivid or black; or mixed with phlegm, or of various colours: the best\r\nis warm, red, moderately thick, and not glutinous. Therefore from the\r\nfirst the cure of a wound, which has yielded good blood, is more easy\r\nand quick: and afterwards there is more hope of those, from which the\r\nseveral discharges have been of the best kind. Sanies then is bad,\r\nwhere it is in great quantity, over thin, livid, or pale, or black,\r\nor glutinous, or fetid, or such as corrodes the ulcer itself and the\r\nadjacent skin. It is better, when the quantity is small, indifferently\r\nthick, of a reddish colour, or inclining to white. Ichor again is the\r\nworst, that is plentiful, thick, inclining to a livid or pale colour,\r\nglutinous, black, hot, fetid. It is more tolerable, if inclining to\r\nwhite, and when in all other respects it is the reverse of the former.\r\nBut melicera is bad, when it is in great quantity, and very thick;\r\nbetter, when thinner, and less in quantity. Pus is the best amongst\r\nthese. But even that too is bad, when it is copious, thin, diluted;\r\nand the more so, if it be such from the beginning; also if in colour\r\nit resemble serum, if it be pale, or livid, or feculent; moreover if\r\nit be fetid; unless the smell arises from the nature of the particular\r\npart, where the ulcer is. The less there is of it, and the thicker,\r\nand whiter, so much the better; and also if it be smooth, if it have\r\nno smell, if it be homogeneous. In quantity, however, it ought to\r\ncorrespond both with the size and age of the wound: for a greater\r\nquantity is discharged naturally from a larger one; and more before the\r\ninflammation is removed, than afterwards. Elæodes also when plentiful,\r\nand containing but little fat, is bad: but the less there is of it, and\r\nthe more oily so much the better.\r\n\r\n  [EO] ἰχὼρ.\r\n\r\n  [EP] μελίκηρα.\r\n\r\n  [EQ] ἐλαιω̃δες.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Cure of a hæmorrhage from a wound._]\r\n\r\nThese things being considered, when any person is wounded, that can\r\nbe cured, two things are immediately to be regarded: that he do not\r\nperish either by a hæmorrhage, or an inflammation. If we are afraid of\r\na hæmorrhage (which may be known from the situation of the wound and\r\nits largeness, and from the force of the stream of blood) the wound\r\nis to be filled with dry lint, and over it a sponge squeezed out of\r\ncold water must be applied, and pressed down with the hand. If this\r\ndoes not stop the blood, the lint is to be frequently changed: and if\r\nit have not strength enough dry, it must be moistened with vinegar.\r\nThis is very powerful in stopping blood: and therefore some people\r\npour it into the wound. But here again it is to be feared, that the\r\nmatter being too forcibly retained there, may afterwards raise a great\r\ninflammation. Which is the reason why neither corroding medicines,\r\nnor such as are caustic, and therefore forming a slough, are to be\r\nused, although most of these stop blood: but if recourse is ever had\r\nto them, such ought rather to be employed, as are the mildest in their\r\noperation. But if even these do not prevail against the hæmorrhage,\r\nthe vessels, which discharge the blood are to be taken hold of, and\r\ntied in two places about the wounded part, and cut through, that they\r\nmay both unite together, and nevertheless have their orifices closed.\r\nWhen the circumstances do not even allow of this measure, they may\r\nbe cauterized with a hot iron. And in this case too, when there is a\r\nconsiderable hæmorrhage from a part, where there is neither nerve, nor\r\nmuscle, in the forehead for instance, or upper part of the head, it is\r\nvery proper to apply a cupping vessel to the opposite part, that the\r\ncurrent of blood may be diverted thither.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Cure of the inflammation in wounds._]\r\n\r\nThese then are the remedies against a haemorrhage: but for an\r\ninflammation the flux of blood itself is the cure. This may be\r\napprehended, when either a bone has been hurt, or a nerve, or a\r\ncartilage, or a muscle, or when the haemorrhage has been too small in\r\nproportion to the size of the wound. Therefore when any thing of this\r\nkind happens, it will not be proper to stop the blood quickly, but to\r\nsuffer it to flow as long as it is safe; insomuch that if the discharge\r\nhas appeared small, it ought also to be taken from the arm; especially\r\nif the patient be young and robust, and used to exercise; much more,\r\nif he was intoxicated before he received the wound. And if a muscle\r\nshall appear to be wounded, it must be cut through: for when it is only\r\ndivided in part, it is mortal; cut quite through it admits of a cure.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _The agglutination of wounds._]\r\n\r\nThe blood then being either stopped, when the haemorrhage is excessive,\r\nor _more_ taken away _by phlebotomy_ when too small, it is far the best\r\nmethod to agglutinate the wound. Now this may be done, either when it\r\nis in the skin, or even in the flesh, if nothing else is hurt. It may\r\nbe done, where the flesh is hanging down in one part, and adhering\r\nin another; provided however it be still sound, and nourished by its\r\ncontinuity with the body.\r\n\r\nIn wounds to be agglutinated there is a double method of cure. For if\r\nthe wound be in a soft place, it ought to be sewed: and especially, if\r\nthe extremity of the ear, or the lower part of the nose be cut, or the\r\nforehead, or the cheek, or the eye-brow, or the lip, or the skin about\r\nthe throat, or the belly. But if the wound is in the flesh, and gapes,\r\nand its lips cannot be easily brought together, a suture is improper:\r\nand in this case fibulæ(64) are to be put on (the Greeks call them\r\nancteres[ER]) to draw the lips a little closer; that the cicatrix may\r\nbe the less broad after the cure.\r\n\r\n  [ER] ἀγκτη̃ρες.\r\n\r\nHence now it may be collected, whether a wound, in which the flesh\r\nis in one part depending, and in another adhering, if it is not yet\r\ncorrupted, requires a suture, or a fibula. But neither of them ought\r\nto be applied before the wound be cleansed within, lest any concreted\r\nblood be left there. For that turns to pus, raises an inflammation, and\r\nprevents the wound from being agglutinated. Even the lint, that is put\r\ninto it to stop the bleeding, must not be left there; for that also\r\ninflames.\r\n\r\nIt will be necessary to take up with the needle, or the fibula, not\r\nonly the skin, but also some of the flesh below it, that it may adhere\r\nthe more strongly, and not break away the skin. Both of them are best\r\ndone with soft thread(65), not too much twisted, that it may be the\r\nless uneasy to the part. Neither of them are to be applied at too great\r\ndistances, nor too frequently: if at too great distances they will not\r\nhold; if too frequently they are very hurtful; because the oftener\r\nthe needle has passed, and the more places are gauled by the fibula,\r\nso much the greater will the inflammation be; and especially in the\r\nsummer-time. Neither of them requires any force; but the operation is\r\nonly so far useful, as the skin follows the hand as it were of its\r\nown accord. Now the fibula commonly allows a wound to be broader: a\r\nsuture joins its lips, but these should not touch one another in every\r\npart; that if any humour be collected within, there may be a passage\r\nfor it to escape. But if a wound admits of neither of these, it ought\r\nnevertheless to be cleansed.\r\n\r\nIn the next place, upon every wound should be applied first a sponge\r\nsqueezed out of vinegar: if any patient is not able to bear the\r\nstrength of vinegar, wine must be made use of: a slight wound is helped\r\nby laying on a sponge squeezed even out of cold water. But in whatever\r\nway it is put on, it does good no longer than it is moist: therefore\r\nit must not be suffered to dry. A wound may be cured without foreign,\r\nscarce, and compound medicines. But if one has not confidence in that\r\nmethod, he ought to apply a medicine, that is composed, without suet,\r\nof those things, which I mentioned to be proper for bloody wounds; and\r\nparticularly if it be in the flesh, the barbarum: if it be a nerve,\r\nor cartilage, or any of the prominent parts, as the ears, or lips, the\r\nsphragis of Polybus. The green Alexandrian also is fit for the nerves;\r\nand for the prominent parts that, which the Greeks call rhuptousa[ES].\r\n\r\n  [ES] ῥύπτουσα.--Our author has not mentioned this plaister before, at\r\n  least not under the same name.\r\n\r\nIt is common also, where there is a contusion, for the skin to be\r\na little broken. When this happens, it is not improper to make a\r\nlarger opening with a knife; unless there be muscles and nerves near\r\nto it, which it is not fit to cut. When it is sufficiently opened, a\r\nmedicine must be applied. But if the bruised part cannot admit the\r\nopening, though too small, to be enlarged, upon account of nerves or\r\nmuscles, such applications are to be used, as may draw out the humour\r\ngently; and of that kind the fittest for the present purpose is the\r\ncomposition, which I said was called rhypodes. It is not improper\r\nalso, wherever there is a severe wound, after applying(66) what is\r\nagreeable to it; to cover the whole with sordid wool moistened with\r\nvinegar and oil; or if the part be soft, a mild restringent cataplasm;\r\nif nervous, or muscular, an emollient.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _The proper bandages for wounds._]\r\n\r\nFor binding up a wound a linen roller is most convenient: and this\r\nought to be bandages for so broad, that a single application of it may\r\nnot only cover the wound, but take in a little on each side of it. If\r\nthe flesh has shrunk away more on one side, it is better to begin the\r\nrolling from thence; if equally on both sides, it ought to lay hold of\r\nthe lips transversely; or if the nature of the wound does not admit of\r\nthat, the middle of it is first put on, that it may be drawn afterwards\r\nboth ways. Now it is to be bound on in such a manner, that it may both\r\nhold, and not be over tight. When it does not hold, it slides off; and\r\nthat, which is over tight, hazards a gangrene. In the winter-time the\r\nroller ought to be carried round oftener; in the summer, no more than\r\nnecessity requires. Then the extremity of it is to be sewed to the\r\nlower part of the bandage. For a knot hurts a wound, unless it be at a\r\ndistance from it.\r\n\r\nMoreover every person ought to know, that the viscera, which I\r\nmentioned before, require a particular method of cure. For the external\r\nwound is to be cured either by a suture, or some other method. In the\r\nbowels nothing is to be touched, unless some bit in the extremity of\r\nthe liver, or spleen, or lungs be hanging out, which may be cut away.\r\nOtherwise the internal wound is to be cured by the diet and medicines,\r\nwhich I mentioned in the former book as agreeable to each viscus.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Directions for the patient’s diet._]\r\n\r\nThese steps being taken on the first day, the patient must be put to\r\nbed: and if the wound be severe, he ought to abstain from food, as\r\nmuch as his strength will permit, before the inflammation comes on;\r\nto satisfy his thirst with warm water, or if it be in summer, and he\r\nhave neither fever nor pain, the water may be cold. However no rule\r\nis so constant, but that a regard must always be had to the strength\r\nof the patient; so that his weakness may render it necessary to take\r\nfood immediately, but such as is thin, and in small quantity, just\r\nsufficient to support him. And many sinking under a hæmorrhage, before\r\nany thing else be done, are even to be refreshed with wine; which is\r\notherwise very prejudicial to a wound.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Good and bad symptoms in wounds._]\r\n\r\nIt is dangerous for a wound to swell too much: not to swell at all is\r\nextremely dangerous. The first is a sign of a violent inflammation;\r\nthe other of a mortification. If the patient be sensible, and no fever\r\nhas come on, we may at once conclude, that the wound will be soon\r\nhealed: and even a fever ought not to alarm us, if in a large wound it\r\ncontinue, while the inflammation subsists; it is bad, when it either\r\nsupervenes to a slight wound, or lasts longer than the inflammation,\r\nor brings on a delirium; or if it does not remove a tetanus, or\r\nconvulsion, that arose from the wound. Also an involuntary bilious\r\nvomiting coming on either immediately after the wound is received,\r\nor while the inflammation continues, is a bad symptom in those only,\r\nwhose nerves, or nervous parts are wounded. However to take a vomit is\r\nnot hurtful; especially in those, who have been accustomed to it; but\r\nneither immediately after meat, nor when the inflammation has begun,\r\nnor when the wound is in the superior parts.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Dressings for wounds._]\r\n\r\nThe wound being kept thus for two days, on third it must be opened,\r\nand the sanies must be wiped off with cold water, and the same kind\r\nof dressings put on. On the fifth day it will be easy to judge to\r\nwhat height the inflammation is to rise. On which day the wound must\r\nbe uncovered again, and its colour observed. And if it be livid, or\r\npale, or variegated, or black, we may be sure it is a bad wound: and\r\nwhensoever this appearance is observed, it may alarm us. It is best for\r\na wound to be white, or ruddy. Also a hard, thick, and painful skin\r\ndenotes danger. It is a good sign, when this is free from pain, thin\r\nand soft. But if the wound is closed, or there be a slight swelling,\r\nthe same application must be used as at first.\r\n\r\nIf the inflammation is violent, with no hopes of an agglutination,\r\nand does not yield, the use of warm water too is necessary, that it\r\nmay dissipate the matter, and soften the hardness, and promote a\r\nsuppuration. It must be of such a degree of warmth, as to be agreeable\r\nto the hand; and be continued so long, till it appear to have\r\ndiminished in some measure the swelling, and restored a more natural\r\nheat to the ulcer. After this fomentation, if the wound does not gape\r\nmuch, a plaister should be applied immediately, and if it be a large\r\nwound, the tetrapharmacum would be best; in the joints, fingers, or\r\ncartilaginous parts, the rhypodes. But if it gapes pretty much, that\r\nsame plaister must be softened with ointment of iris, and lint spread\r\nwith it must be laid over the wound; then the plaister applied above,\r\nand over that sordid wool; and the rollers must be also less tight than\r\nat first.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Peculiar directions for wounds in the joints._]\r\n\r\nBut there are some peculiarities to be attended to in the joints. If\r\nthe nerves, which secure them, are cut through, a weakness of that part\r\nfollows. If that is uncertain, and the wound is from a sharp weapon,\r\nand that in a transverse direction, it is more easy to cure: and if it\r\nbe from a blunt and heavy one, the figure of it makes no difference:\r\nbut it must be observed whether the pus comes from above or below the\r\njoint. If it come from under it, and continue a long time white and\r\nthick, it is probable that a nerve is cut through, and the more so, the\r\ngreater the pains and inflammations are, and the sooner they began. But\r\nalthough the nerve be not cut through, yet if a hard tumour continue\r\nround it long, the ulcer of necessity must be tedious, and even when\r\nthat is healed, the tumour will remain; and it will be a considerable\r\ntime before that limb recover its power either of extension or\r\ncontraction. And it is longer before it can be extended, when the cure\r\nhas been conducted with the joint bent, than it is before one can be\r\nbent, which we have kept straight. The limb, that is wounded, ought to\r\nbe placed also in a certain position: if it is to be agglutinated, it\r\nmust be laid high; if it is inflamed, so as to incline to neither side;\r\nif the pus has begun to flow, it must be kept in a depending posture.\r\n\r\nRest too is an excellent remedy. Motion and walking are prejudicial,\r\nexcept to people in health: however, less dangerous to such as are\r\nwounded in the head or arms, than those, that are wounded in the lower\r\nparts. And walking is least of all proper, when the hurt is in the\r\nthigh, or the leg, or the foot. The place, where the patient lies,\r\nought to be warm. Bathing also, while the wound is not clean, is\r\nextremely bad: for that renders it both tumid and foul; from whence the\r\ntransition to a gangrene is common. Gentle friction is good; but in\r\nthose parts, that are at a great distance from the wound.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Deterging of wounds._]\r\n\r\nAfter the inflammation is gone, the wound must be deterged. That end\r\nis best obtained by lint dipt in honey; and over that must be applied\r\neither the tetrapharmacum plaister, or the enneapharmacum. Now that\r\nulcer is clean, which appears red, and is neither too dry nor too\r\nmoist. But any ulcer that is deprived of its sensibility, or whose\r\nfeeling is unnaturally exquisite, or that is either too dry or too\r\nmoist, or that is either whitish or livid, or black, that ulcer is not\r\nclean.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Incarning of wounds._]\r\n\r\nAfter a wound is deterged, it must next be incarned; and for that\r\npurpose warm water is so far necessary, as to remove the sanies. The\r\nuse of sordid wool is improper; it is better to cover it with such as\r\nhas been washed. And there are also some medicines, which conduce to\r\nthe filling up of the wound; therefore it is not amiss to make use\r\nof them: such as butter with oil of roses, and a small proportion of\r\nhoney; or the plaister tetrapharmacum with the same proportion of\r\nhoney, or with the oil of roses; or lint dipped in oil of roses. But\r\nthe bath used sparingly is more efficacious; and food of a good juice,\r\navoiding every thing acrid. When they are almost filled up, birds and\r\nvenison and boiled pork may be given. Wine is always hurtful, while\r\nthere is a fever or inflammation; and indeed, till it be cicatrized,\r\nif either nerves or muscles are wounded; or even the flesh, if it be\r\ndeep. But if the wound is of the safer kind, and only superficial,\r\nwine not very old, given in moderate quantities however, may promote\r\nthe incarnation. If any thing is to be softened, which is necessary in\r\nnervous and muscular parts, cerate must also be laid upon the wound.\r\nBut if fungous flesh has grown upon it, dry lint restrains it gently;\r\ncopper scales more powerfully. If the quantity to be taken away be more\r\nconsiderable, things still stronger must be applied to eat down the\r\nflesh. After these a cicatrix is very well formed by lycium diluted in\r\npassum or milk; or dry lint laid on alone is still more efficacious.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Bad consequences from unsuccessful cures._]\r\n\r\nThis then is the process of a successful cure. But at times things will\r\nhappen to take a dangerous turn. For sometimes the ulcer grows ancient,\r\na callosity comes over it, and its lips are thick, and of a livid\r\ncolour: after which, whatever medicine is applied, does little good;\r\nand this generally happens to an ulcer negligently treated.\r\n\r\nSometimes from an excessive inflammation, or violent heats, or\r\nexcessive cold, or too tight bandages, or the old age or bad habit of\r\nthe patient, a gangrene seizes upon it. This kind of disorder by the\r\nGreeks is divided into several species, for which we have no terms in\r\nour language. Now every gangrene not only corrupts that, which it has\r\nseized upon, but also spreads. But then the distinction is to be made\r\nbetween the species by different symptoms. For sometimes beyond the\r\ninflammation a redness surrounds the ulcer, and spreads with pain; the\r\nGreeks call it erysipelas[ET].; sometimes the ulcer is black, because\r\nthe flesh of it is corrupted, and the blackness is greatly increased\r\nas the putrefaction goes on, when the wound is moist, and from the\r\nblack ulcer is discharged a pale fetid liquor, and the flesh within is\r\ncorrupted(67): sometimes also the nerves and membranes are dissolved,\r\nand a probe put in descends either laterally or downwards; sometimes\r\nthe bone is affected with that disorder: and sometimes there follows\r\nwhat the Greeks call gangræna[EU].\r\n\r\n  [ET] ἐρυσίπελας.\r\n\r\n  [EU] γάγγραινα.\r\n\r\nThe former kinds happen in any part of the body: the last mentioned\r\nabout the extremities, that is, the nails, the armpits, or groin; and\r\ngenerally in old people, or in such as are in a bad habit of body. The\r\nflesh of such an ulcer is either black or livid, but dry and withered,\r\nand the contiguous skin is for the most part covered with pustules of\r\na dark brown colour; then the next to that is either pale or livid,\r\nand commonly of an æruginous colour, and void of sensation; the skin\r\na little farther off(68) is inflamed. And all these spread at once;\r\nthe ulcer into the pustulous part; the pustules to the part that is\r\npale or livid; the paleness or livor to that which is inflamed; and the\r\ninflammation proceeds to that which is sound. In the mean time an acute\r\nfever comes on, and a vehement thirst; some are also delirious; others,\r\nthough they be sensible, stammer, and with great difficulty can make\r\ntheir meaning understood; the stomach begins to be affected; the breath\r\nitself acquires a fetid smell. Now this disorder in the beginning\r\nadmits of a cure; but when it is thoroughly rooted, it is incurable;\r\nand most of them die with a cold sweat.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _The cure of an old ulcer._]\r\n\r\nThese are the dangers, to which wounds are liable. But when the ulcer\r\nis old, it must be cut round with a knife, and its lips cut off, and\r\nwhatever beyond them is livid, must likewise be scarified. If there be\r\na small varix within, which prevents its healing, that also must be cut\r\nout. Afterwards when blood has been discharged, and a new face thus\r\ngiven to the wound, the same method of cure must be pursued, which has\r\nbeen directed for recent wounds. If any person does not chuse to make\r\nuse of a knife, the plaister, which is composed of labdanum, may incarn\r\nit, and when the ulcer has been eaten down by that, a plaister, which\r\nbrings on a cicatrix.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Of an erysipelas._]\r\n\r\nNow that, which I said has the name of an erysipelas, is not only\r\nconsequent upon a wound, but often happens without it, and is sometimes\r\nvery dangerous; especially if its seat be about the neck or head.\r\n\r\nIt is proper, if the strength will admit, to bleed; then to apply at\r\nonce repellents and coolers, and particularly cerus with the juice of\r\nnightshade, or cimolian chalk with rain water; or meal made into a\r\npaste with the same water, with the addition of cypress, or if it be in\r\na tender part, with lentils. Whatever is applied, must be covered with\r\na beet leaf, and upon that must be laid a linen cloth dipped in cold\r\nwater. If coolers alone do little service, the following mixture must\r\nbe made; of sulphur p. i. *. ceruss, saffron, each p. x. *. and these\r\nto be rubbed down with wine, and spread over the part: or if the place\r\nis not tender, leaves of nightshade powdered must be mixed with hog’s\r\nlard, and applied spread upon linen.\r\n\r\nBut if there be a blackness, which does not yet spread, such\r\napplications must be used, as will gently eat away the putrid flesh;\r\nand the ulcer being thus cleansed, must be dressed in the same manner\r\nas others. If it be more putrid, and already begins to advance and\r\nspread, there is a necessity for stronger corrosives. If even these\r\ndo not overcome it, the part must be cauterized, till no moisture\r\nflow from it; for whatever is sound, is dry when it is burnt. After\r\nthe burning of a putrid ulcer, such applications must be used, as\r\nmay separate the sloughs from the quick part; the Greeks call them\r\napescharotica[EV]. When they have fallen off, the ulcer must be\r\ncleansed, particularly with honey and resin; but it may be cleansed\r\nalso by those things with which purulent ulcers are dressed, and healed\r\nup by the like methods.\r\n\r\n  [EV] ἀπεσχαρωτικὰ.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Of a gangrene._]\r\n\r\nIt is not very difficult to cure a gangrene, if it has not got full\r\npossession, but is only beginning, especially in a young person: and\r\neasier still, if the muscles are sound; or if the nerves are either\r\nuntouched, or but slightly affected; and no large joint laid bare; or\r\nthere be but little flesh in that part, and consequently not much to\r\nputrify, and if the disorder is confined to one place, which chiefly\r\nhappens in a finger. In such a case the first thing to be done, if the\r\nstrength will allow, is to let blood: after that, to cut through to the\r\nsound flesh, whatever is dry, which by a kind of tension is uneasy to\r\nthe contiguous parts.\r\n\r\nWhile the disorder is spreading, no suppurating medicines are to be\r\napplied; and for that reason not so much as warm water. Ponderous\r\nmedicines also, although they be repellent, are hurtful; but the\r\nlightest of that nature are required; and over the parts, which are\r\ninflamed, coolers must be applied. If the disease is not stopped by\r\nthese, so much as is betwixt the sound and corrupted parts, ought to be\r\ncauterized.\r\n\r\nAnd in this case particularly help must be sought not from medicines\r\nalone, but from a due regimen: for this disease never appears but in\r\na corrupt and vitiated habit. Wherefore in the first place, unless\r\nweakness forbid, the patient must live abstemiously: and then for food\r\nand drink must be given what will bind the belly, and consequently\r\nthe body also; but these must be of a light nature. Afterwards if\r\nthe disorder stop, the same applications must be used as have been\r\nprescribed in a putrid ulcer. And then also a fuller diet may be\r\nallowed of the middle class: only such however as tends to dry the\r\nbelly and the whole body; and the drink must be cold rain water.\r\nThe bath, unless we are confident of a cure, is hurtful; for the\r\nulcer softened by that means is quickly affected again with the same\r\ndisorder. But sometimes it happens, that all these remedies do no\r\nservice, and notwithstanding all their force, the gangrene spreads. In\r\nwhich case the miserable but sole remedy is to cut off that limb, which\r\nis perishing by degrees, to save the rest of the body.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _The cure of more slight wounds._]\r\n\r\nThis then is the method of treating the most severe wounds. But even\r\nsuch are not to be neglected, where the skin is entire, but the flesh\r\nwithin(69) is bruised; or where any thing is razed or rubbed off the\r\nsurface; or when a splinter is fixed into the flesh; or when a wound,\r\nthough small, has penetrated deep.\r\n\r\nIn the first case it is a very proper remedy to boil pomegranate bark\r\nin wine, and bruising the inner part of it, to mix it with a cerate of\r\nthe oil of roses, which is to be laid upon the part; then where the\r\nskin is razed, to cover it with a mild medicine, such as the lipara[EW].\r\n\r\n  [EW] λιπαρὰ.\r\n\r\nUpon the part, that has its surface razed and rubbed off, the\r\ntetrapharmacum plaister must be applied, and the quantity of food\r\ndiminished, and wine denied. Nor should such a hurt be looked upon as\r\ncontemptible, because the wound is not deep: for from such accidents\r\ngangrenes often arise. But if it be slight and of small extent, the\r\nmild medicine abovementioned may be sufficient for the cure.\r\n\r\nA splinter, if possible, must be extracted either by the hand or\r\nby an instrument: if it has either broke or penetrated deeper than\r\nto admit of this, it must be drawn out by a medicine. Now the best\r\napplication for that purpose is the root of a reed; which if tender,\r\nmust be immediately bruised; if grown hard, it may be first boiled in\r\nmulse: to this honey must always be added; or birthwort with honey must\r\nbe applied. The worst splinter is that of a reed, on account of its\r\nasperity: the fern is also equally hurtful: but it has been found by\r\nexperience, that each of these bruised and applied is a cure for the\r\nother. Every medicine, that has the faculty of drawing, has the same\r\neffect in all splinters. The same kind of medicine is also finest for\r\ndeep and small wounds: the plaister of Philocrates is best adapted to\r\nthe former, that of Hecatæus to the latter case.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Of cicatrizing ulcers._]\r\n\r\nIn any wound, when we are to form the cicatrix (which is necessary\r\nafter the ulcers are thoroughly cleansed and incarned) in the first\r\nplace lint dipped in cold water must be applied, while the growth of\r\nflesh is encouraged; afterwards when that is to be restrained, it\r\nmust be put on dry, till a cicatrix be formed; then white lead ought\r\nto be bound over it, which both compresses the cicatrix, and gives\r\nit a colour resembling the sound part of the body. The root of wild\r\ncucumber has the same effect. Also the composition, which contains of\r\nelaterium p. i. *. litharge p. ii. *. myrobalans p. iv. *. to which is\r\nadded turpentine resin, till the whole be brought to the consistence\r\nof a plaister. But black cicatrices are gently cleansed by a mixture\r\nof equal parts of verdigrease, and washed lead, and the same resin\r\nboiled, whether the cicatrix be anointed with this, which may be\r\npractised in the face, or it be applied like a plaister, which is more\r\nconvenient in other parts of the body.\r\n\r\nBut if the cicatrix is either protuberant or hollow, it is ridiculous,\r\nmerely in regard to the appearance to submit a second time to the pain\r\nand trouble of a cure; otherwise both cases might be remedied. For\r\neither of these cicatrices may be converted into a wound by the knife.\r\nIf one rather chuses a medicine, the same purpose is answered by those\r\ncompositions, which eat down flesh. When the skin is taken off, upon\r\nthe prominent one must be applied eating medicines, upon the hollow one\r\nsuch as tend to fill up, till both these kinds of ulcers be brought to\r\nthe level of the sound skin, and then they may be cicatrized.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. XXVII.\r\n\r\nOF WOUNDS CAUSED BY BITES; POISONS TAKEN INTERNALLY; AND BURNS.\r\n\r\n\r\nI have treated of those wounds, which are most commonly inflicted\r\nby weapons. It follows, that I speak concerning those, which are\r\noccasioned by the bite, sometimes of a man, sometimes of an ape, often\r\nof a dog, sometimes of wild beasts, or other animals, or serpents. Now\r\nalmost all bites(70) are in some degree venomous.\r\n\r\nTherefore if the wound be severe, a cupping vessel must be applied;\r\nif slight, a plaister must be immediately put on, particularly that\r\nof Diogenes; if that is not to be had, any of those, which I have\r\nprescribed against bites; if these are not to be got, the green\r\nAlexandrian; if that is not at hand neither, any of those, which are\r\nnot greasy, that are calculated for recent wounds. Salt is also a\r\nremedy for them, and particularly for the bite of a dog, if it be\r\napplied dry, and the part be chaffed with two fingers; for it brings\r\nout the sanies. It is also of use to bind salt fish over such a wound.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _The bite of a mad dog._]\r\n\r\nIf the dog was mad, it is more especially necessary to extract the\r\npoison by cupping. After that, if the part is neither nervous nor\r\nmuscular, the wound must be cauterized. If it cannot be cauterized,\r\nit is proper for the patient to be bled. Then upon the wound, after\r\nburning, must be applied what is proper for other cauterized ulcers.\r\nSuch as have not been cauterized must be treated with those medicines,\r\nthat powerfully corrode the flesh. After which the wound must be filled\r\nup, and healed by no other than the common method already laid down.\r\nSome presently after the bite of a mad dog order such a patient into\r\nthe bath, and allow him to sweat there as long as he is able, with the\r\nwound bare, that the poison may the more readily be discharged; then\r\nthey refresh him with plenty of strong wine, which is an antidote to\r\nall poisons. And when this method has been pursued for three days, the\r\npatient is thought out of danger.\r\n\r\nBut it is usual for such a wound, if not effectually treated, to\r\nproduce a fear of water. The Greeks call it hydrophobia[EX]: a most\r\nmiserable kind of disease, in which the patient is tormented at once\r\nwith thirst, and a dread of water. When this happens, there is very\r\nlittle hope left. But yet there is one remedy: to throw the patient\r\nunawares suddenly into a pond, and if he cannot swim, to suffer him to\r\nsink sometimes, and thus drink, and sometimes to lift up his head; if\r\nhe can swim, to keep him down at times, that even against his will he\r\nmay be satiated with water: for thus at once both the thirst and dread\r\nof water is removed. But this practice is attended with another danger,\r\nwhich is, that a weak body fatigued in cold water, may be destroyed by\r\na convulsion. To prevent which, from the pond he must immediately be\r\nput into warm oil. An antidote (particularly that which I mentioned\r\nfirst, or in its stead another) if the patient is not possessed with\r\nthe horror of water, may be given to drink in water; if he be offended\r\nwith its bitterness, honey must be added; but if that disease has\r\nalready come on, it may be taken in the form of catapotia.\r\n\r\n  [EX] ὑδροφοβία.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Of the bites of serpents in general._]\r\n\r\nThe bites of serpents do not require a very different treatment:\r\nalthough in this the ancients varied greatly; in so much that they\r\nprescribed as many distinct methods as there were kinds of snakes; in\r\nwhich too they differed widely from each other. But generally the same\r\nremedies have the best success in all of them. Wherefore in the first\r\nplace the limb must be tied above the wound; but not too tight, lest\r\nit become torpid. Then the poison must be extracted. This is best done\r\nby cupping. Neither is it improper to cut round the wound first with a\r\nknife, that the more of the blood already vitiated may be extracted.\r\nIf a cupping vessel cannot be had (which can scarcely happen) then any\r\nother similar vessel will do, which will serve the same purpose. If\r\nnone such can be got, a person must be employed to suck the wound.\r\n\r\nNor indeed have those, that are called Psylli(71), any peculiar\r\nskill, but a boldness confirmed purely by custom. For the poison of\r\na serpent, as also some of those, which hunters make use of, and\r\nespecially in Gaul(72), are not hurtful, taken in by the mouth, but\r\ninjected by a wound: and for that reason even a snake itself is safely\r\neaten: its bite is mortal, and when it is in a state of stupidity\r\n(which dealers in legerdemain can produce by the force of some drugs)\r\nif one puts his finger into its mouth, and is not bit, he receives\r\nno hurt from the saliva. Therefore any person that, like a Psyllus,\r\nshall suck the wound, will both be safe himself, and save the patient.\r\nIn the mean time he ought to attend to this first, that he have no\r\nulcer either in his gums, or palate, or any other part of his mouth.\r\nAfterwards the patient must be laid in a warm place, in such a posture,\r\nthat the part, which is wounded, may be in a depending posture.\r\n\r\nIf no body can be got to suck the wound, nor a cupping vessel is at\r\nhand, the patient ought to sup goose or veal broth, till he vomit. A\r\nchicken must also be cut through the middle alive, and immediately\r\napplied warm over the wound, with the internal part next the body.\r\nThe same effect is produced by a kid, or a lamb cut up, and the warm\r\nflesh immediately laid upon the wound, and by the plaisters, that have\r\nbeen mentioned before: the most proper of which is the Ephesian, or\r\nthat, which follows it. To take some antidote too immediately, is a\r\npowerful protection against the danger. But if that cannot be had,\r\nit is necessary to sup a little pure wine with pepper, or any thing\r\nelse, which serves to excite heat, and does not suffer the humour to\r\ncoagulate within. For the greatest part of poisons kills by cold. All\r\ndiuretics too, because they attenuate the humour, are useful.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Of the bite of an aspis._]\r\n\r\nThe former remedies are general, and good against bites: but experience\r\nitself has taught us, that a person, who has been bit by an aspis,\r\nought rather to drink vinegar. Which is said to have been discovered\r\nby the case of a certain boy, who, when he had been wounded by one,\r\nand partly from the wound itself, and partly from the excessive heat\r\nof the weather, was tormented with thirst, and the country being dry,\r\ncould find no other liquor, drank off vinegar, which he chanced to have\r\nby him, and was cured. The reason of the effect in my opinion is, that\r\nvinegar, though it refrigerate, yet has a faculty of dissipating at the\r\nsame time. Whence it happens, that earth sprinkled with it rises in a\r\nfroth. From the same virtue therefore it is very probable, that the\r\nfluids of the human body beginning to be coagulated are dissipated by\r\nit, and health thereby restored.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Of the scorpion._]\r\n\r\nAgainst the poison of some other serpents also peculiar remedies are\r\nwell known. For the scorpion is a most excellent remedy against itself.\r\nSome drink it bruised with wine. Some apply it in the same form to the\r\nwound. Others laying it upon live coals fumigate the wound with it,\r\nkeeping a cloth all round it, that the smoke may not escape; and then\r\nbind it on when burnt to a coal. Now it is proper to drink in wine\r\nthe seed, or at least the leaves of turnsole (which the Greeks call\r\nheliotropium[EY].) And over the wound it is fit to apply bran with\r\nvinegar, or wild rue, or salt toasted with honey. But I have known\r\nphysicians, who have done nothing else to people stung by a scorpion,\r\nbut bled them in the arm.\r\n\r\n  [EY] ἡλιοτρόπιον.\r\n\r\nFor the sting of a scorpion also, and a spider, garlick mixed with rue,\r\nand rubbed down with oil, is a proper application.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Of the cerastes, dipsas, and hæmorrhois._]\r\n\r\nFor a wound given by a cerastes(73), or dipsas(74), or hæmorrhois(75),\r\nthe remedy is dried asphodel, about the bigness of an Egyptian bean,\r\nwith the addition of a little rue given in drink, and divided into\r\ntwo doses. Trefoil also and horse-mint, and panaces with vinegar are\r\nequally good. Also costus, and cassia, and cinnamon are proper to take\r\nin drink.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Of a chersydrus._]\r\n\r\nAgainst the wound of a chersydrus(76), panaces or laser, or each\r\nscruples p. ii. *. Or the juice of a leek is to be taken with a hemina\r\nof wine, and savory eaten plentifully. And let goat’s dung boiled in\r\nvinegar be laid upon the wound; or barley meal in the same manner with\r\nvinegar; or rue, or cat-mint, powdered with salt and mixed with honey.\r\nAnd this is equally efficacious against the bite of a cerastes.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Of a phalangium._]\r\n\r\nWhen a phalangium(77) has given a wound, beside the chirurgical part\r\nof the cure, the patient should be frequently plunged into the warm\r\nbath, and an equal quantity of myrrh and stavesacre is to be given in a\r\nhemina of passum; or radish-seed, or darnel-root with wine; let there\r\nbe also applied to the wound bran boiled with vinegar, and he must be\r\nordered to continue quiet.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Of Italian snakes._]\r\n\r\nBut the kinds of serpents mentioned hitherto are foreign, and much more\r\ndangerous than ours; especially those, which are in very hot countries.\r\nItaly and the colder climates, besides that they are more healthful in\r\nother respects, have the advantage in this, that they produce snakes\r\nless formidable. Their bites are well enough cured by the herb betony,\r\nor bindweed, or centory, or agrimony, or germander, or burdock, or\r\npastinaca fish(78), either singly, or any two of them taken together\r\npowdered, and thus given to drink in wine, and also applied upon the\r\nwound. It is necessary to observe, that the bite of every serpent is\r\nmore hurtful, when either the animal or the wounded person is fasting,\r\nand therefore they are most pernicious when they are hatching; and it\r\nis adviseable, when any one is apprehensive of meeting serpents, not to\r\ngo out, before he has taken some food.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Of poisons._]\r\n\r\nIt is not so easy to relieve those, who have swallowed poison, either\r\nin their food or drink. In the first place, because they do not\r\nperceive it immediately, as those do, who are bit by a snake; and\r\ntherefore cannot instantly apply the remedy. In the next place, because\r\nthe hurt does not begin in the skin, but in the internal parts. However\r\nit is best, as soon as one discovers it, immediately to drink largely\r\nof oil, and to vomit. And then, when he has emptied his praecordia, to\r\ntake an antidote in his drink; if that is not to be got, pure wine.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Remedies against cantharides._]\r\n\r\nNevertheless there are some peculiar remedies against certain\r\npoisons, and chiefly of the milder kind. For if any person has drunk\r\ncantharides, he ought to take panaces bruised with milk, or galbanum,\r\nwith the addition of wine, or milk by itself.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Against hemlock._]\r\n\r\nIf hemlock, let the patient drink as much hot pure wine with rue as he\r\ncan; then he must be forced to vomit; after that, laser with wine must\r\nbe given; and, if he be free of a fever, he must be put into the warm\r\nbath; if not, be anointed with warm ingremedies. After these, rest is\r\nnecessary for him.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Henbane._]\r\n\r\nIf henbane, hot mulse must be drunk, or any kind of milk, but more\r\nparticularly asses milk.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Ceruss._]\r\n\r\nIf ceruss, the juice of mallows, or of a bruised walnut with wine are\r\nmost serviceable.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _A leech._]\r\n\r\nIf one happens to swallow a leech in drinking, vinegar with salt must\r\nbe given. If milk has curdled in the stomach, either passum, or laser\r\nwith vinegar.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Poisonous mushrooms._]\r\n\r\nIf a person has eaten poisonous mushrooms, let him take radish\r\neither out of vinegar and water, or salt and vinegar. These may both\r\nbe distinguished from the good by their form, and also be rendered\r\ninnocent by the manner of dressing. For they are perfectly freed from\r\nall noxious qualities, by boiling them in oil, or with a twig of a\r\npear-tree.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Of burns._]\r\n\r\nBurns are also to be reckoned amongst the effects of external violence.\r\nThe plan laid down, therefore, seems to oblige me to speak of them\r\nin this place. They are best cured by the leaves either of lilly, or\r\nhound’s-tongue, or betes boiled in wine and oil. Any of these presently\r\napplied heals them.\r\n\r\nBut the method of cure may also be divided into those things, which\r\nbeing gently eating and repellent, at first both prevent pustules, and\r\nexcoriate the part; and those, which being lenient, restore the part\r\nto its soundness. Of the former is the meal of lentils with honey,\r\nor myrrh with wine; or Cimolian chalk, powdered with the bark of\r\nfrankincense, and worked up to a paste with water, and when it is to be\r\nused, diluted with vinegar. Of the second class any of the lipara. But\r\nthe most suitable is that, which contains the dross of lead, or yolks\r\nof eggs.\r\n\r\nAnother way also of treating burns is, while the inflammation\r\ncontinues, to apply to them lentils with honey; when that is gone off,\r\nmeal with rue, or leeks, or horehound, till the crusts fall off, then\r\nvetches with honey, or iris, or turpentine resin, till the ulcer be\r\nclean; last of all, dry lint.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. XXVIII.\r\n\r\nOF EXTERNAL DISORDERS PROCEEDING FROM AN INTERNAL CAUSE, AND THEIR CURE.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Of a carbuncle._]\r\n\r\nFrom external injuries, we proceed to disorders which have an internal\r\norigin, when some part of the body is corrupted. Amongst these none is\r\nworse than a carbuncle. The marks of it are these. There is a redness,\r\nand above that pustules rise, not very high, mostly black, sometimes\r\ninclining to a livid colour, or pale. There seems to be sanies in them;\r\nbelow, the colour is black. The flesh is parched, and harder than it\r\nought to be naturally. And about it, there is a sort of crust; which is\r\nsurrounded with an inflammation. Neither can the skin be lifted up in\r\nthat place, but is, as it were, bound down to the flesh below. There\r\nis a propensity to sleep. Sometimes a shuddering, or fever comes on,\r\nor both. And this disease shoots out roots, as it were, below, and\r\nspreads, sometimes quickly, sometimes more slowly. At the surface also\r\nit spreads and grows white; then becomes livid; and all round it small\r\npustules break out. And if it happen to be near the gullet or fauces,\r\nit often stops the breath suddenly.\r\n\r\nNothing is better than to sear it immediately. Neither is that painful,\r\nfor it has no feeling, because such flesh is mortified. And the burning\r\nshould be continued, till there is a sense of pain on every side. After\r\nthis, the ulcer is to be cured in the same manner, as other burns.\r\nFor by eating medicines is produced an eschar, which being entirely\r\nseparated from the quick flesh, draws with it whatever was corrupted;\r\nand the sinus, by this time clean, may be dressed with incarning\r\nmedicines. But if the disorder be in the surface of the skin, medicines\r\nbarely eating, or at most caustic, may be sufficient. The violence of\r\nthe cure is to be proportioned to the malady. Whatever medicine is\r\napplied, if it has the desired effect, will immediately separate the\r\ncorrupted part from the quick.\r\n\r\nAnd we may generally be confident of success, if the corrupted flesh\r\nfalls off, wherever such medicine eats down; if that does not happen,\r\nand the medicine is overcome by the disease, an immediate recourse\r\nmust be had to the actual cautery. But in such a case, the patient\r\nmust abstain from food and wine. It is also proper to drink water\r\nplentifully. And these directions are to be observed more strictly, if\r\na febricula be added to the other complaints.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Of a Cancer._]\r\n\r\nThere is not so great danger of a cancer[EZ], unless it be irritated by\r\nthe imprudence of the physician. This disease generally happens in the\r\nsuperior parts, about the face, the nose, ears, lips, and breasts of\r\nwomen. It also rises from the liver, or spleen. About the place there\r\nare pricking pains; it is immoveable, and unequally swelled; it is also\r\nsometimes insensible. Around it the veins are inflated, and tortuous;\r\nand either pale or livid; in some also, they are concealed from view.\r\nTouching the part gives pain to some, to others none. Sometimes it is\r\nharder, or softer, than it ought naturally to be, without any ulcer; at\r\nother times, all other circumstances being as above described, there\r\nis likewise an ulcer. Sometimes it has no peculiar characteristic to\r\ndistinguish it; at other times it resembles those which the Greeks call\r\ncondylomata[FA], but has an asperity and magnitude peculiar to itself.\r\nAnd its colour is red, or resembling that of a lentil. Neither is it\r\nsafe to cut it; for immediately there follows either a palsy, or a\r\nconvulsion. Often when a person receives a blow upon it, he loses his\r\nspeech and faints. In some also if the tumour itself be compressed,\r\nthe contiguous parts grow tense and swell. Now this is a very bad\r\nkind(79). Its general progress is this; first appears what the Greeks\r\ncall a cacoethes[FB], then it becomes a carcinoma, without an ulcer.\r\nFrom that an ulcer; and from an ulcer a thymium.\r\n\r\n  [EZ] καρκίνωμα.\r\n\r\n  [FA] κονδυλώματα.\r\n\r\n  [FB] κακόηθες.\r\n\r\nNone of these can be removed but the cacoethes(80); the rest are\r\nirritated by every method of cure; and the more violent the operations\r\nare, the more angry they grow. Some have made use of caustic medicines;\r\nothers of the actual cautery; others cut them out with a knife. Nor\r\nwas any person ever relieved by medicine; but after cauterizing, the\r\ntumours have been quickened in their progress, and increased till\r\nthey proved mortal; when they have been cut out, and cicatrized, they\r\nhave, notwithstanding, returned, and occasioned death. Whereas, at the\r\nsame time, most people, by using no violent methods to attempt the\r\nextirpation of the disease, but only applying mild medicines, to sooth\r\nit, protract their lives, notwithstanding the disorder, to an extreme\r\nold age. But no body can pretend to distinguish a cacoethes, which is\r\ncurable, from a carcinoma, which is not, otherwise than by time and\r\nexperiments.\r\n\r\nTherefore, so soon as this disease is perceived, caustic medicines\r\nought to be applied; if the disorder is alleviated, and its symptoms\r\ngrow milder, we may proceed both to incision and the actual cautery;\r\nif it is immediately irritated, we may conclude, that it is already a\r\ncarcinoma; and every thing acrid and severe is to be taken away. But\r\nif the part is hard, without any ulcer, it is sufficient to apply a\r\nvery mellow fig, or the plaister called rhypodes. If there is an ulcer,\r\nbut not rising _above the surface of the skin_, the cerate of rose oil\r\nis to be put on, with the addition of a powdered shell, with smith’s\r\nforge water. If it grows fungous, copper scales (which is the gentlest\r\ncaustic) must be tried, till there is no rising above the other parts;\r\nprovided still that it does not exasperate; if it does, we ought to be\r\ncontent with the same cerate.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Of a therioma._]\r\n\r\nThere is also an ulcer, which the Greeks call therioma[FC]. This both\r\ncomes of itself, and sometimes is consequent upon an ulcer produced\r\nfrom another cause. The colour is either livid or black; the smell\r\nis bad; it discharges copiously a humour like mucus; it is sensible\r\nneither of the touch, nor of medicine; and is only disturbed by\r\nitching. About it there is a pain and inflammation. Sometimes also a\r\nfever comes on. Sometimes there is a haemorrhage from the ulcer, and\r\nthis disorder spreads, by which all the symptoms often increase. From\r\nthese proceeds the ulcer which the Greeks call herpes esthiomenos[FD],\r\n_voracious herpes_; because by spreading quickly, and penetrating\r\neven to the bones, it devours the body. The surface of this ulcer\r\nis unequal, resembling dirt; and there is in it a great quantity of\r\nglutinous humour, an intolerable smell, and an inflammation more\r\nviolent, than is found in an ulcer of that size. Both of them, as\r\nindeed all the kinds of gangrenes, happen chiefly to old people, or\r\nthose, who are in a bad habit of body.\r\n\r\n  [FC] θηρίωμα.\r\n\r\n  [FD] ἕρπης ἐσθιόμενος.\r\n\r\nThe manner of curing both is the same; but the greater disease requires\r\nthe sharper remedy. And the regimen must first be regulated; the\r\npatient must rest in his bed, for some days abstain from food, drink\r\nwater very plentifully, and have a clyster given him. Then, when the\r\ninflammation is gone, let him take food of a good juice(81), avoiding\r\nevery thing acrid; he may drink as much as he will, provided he be\r\ncontent in the day-time with water but at supper, he may also drink\r\nsome rough wine. But the abstinence should not be equally severe in a\r\nherpes, and a therioma. This then is the regimen necessary.\r\n\r\nExternally upon the ulcer, must be sprinkled powder of dry aloes, and\r\nif that does but little service, chalcitis. But if any nerve, by the\r\nflesh being destroyed, be laid bare, it must be covered first with\r\nlinen, lest it be burnt by that medicine. If there is need of remedies\r\nstill more powerful, we must make use of those compositions, that\r\ncauterize more strongly. Now when any medicine is sprinkled on, it\r\nought to be done by the broad end of a probe(82). Over it should be\r\napplied either lint with honey, or olive leaves boiled in wine, or\r\nhorehound: and these must be covered with linen dipped in cold water,\r\nand then well squeezed. And all round, where there is a tumour from the\r\ninflammation, repellent cataplasms must be applied. If by these methods\r\nit grows no better, the place ought to be cauterized with a _hot_ iron;\r\nthe nerves that are in view being first covered. By what has been said\r\non other occasions, it will be clear enough to any body, that a part,\r\nwhich is burned either by medicines or the actual cautery, must first\r\nbe cleansed, and then filled up.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Of the ignis sacer._]\r\n\r\nThe ignis sacer ought also to be numbered amongst bad ulcers. There\r\nare two species of it. The one is of a colour inclining to ruddy, or\r\na mixture of red and pale, and the surface is roughened by contiguous\r\npustules, of which no one is bigger than another, but they are very\r\nnumerous, and exceeding small. In these there is almost always pus, and\r\noften a redness attended with heat; and that spreads, sometimes when\r\nthe part first affected is healing, sometimes when it is ulcerated,\r\nin which case, the pustules breaking, one continued ulcer is formed,\r\ndischarging a humour, which seems to be betwixt sanies and pus. It\r\nattacks chiefly the breast, or sides, or extremities, and particularly\r\nthe soles of the feet. The other kind comes with an ulceration in the\r\nsurface of the skin, but without going deep, broad, inclining to a\r\nlivid colour, but unequal; and the middle part of it heals, while the\r\nextremities spread; and often that, which seemed to be sound, ulcerates\r\nagain. But the skin round about it, which is to receive the disease,\r\ngrows tumid, and hardish, and the colour of it is a blackish red. And\r\nthis disease too generally attacks old people, or those, that are in a\r\nbad habit, but chiefly in their legs.\r\n\r\nNow every ignis sacer, though it be the least dangerous of those\r\ndisorders, which have the disposition to spread, yet is, I had almost\r\nsaid, the hardest to cure of them all. The most effectual remedy is a\r\nfever for one day, which consumes the noxious humour. The thicker and\r\nwhiter the pus is, so much the less is the danger. It does good also\r\nto excoriate the part below the ulcer by scourging, that the more\r\npus may be evacuated, and the matter drawn out, which corrupts the\r\nflesh there. But notwithstanding if a slight fever comes on, there is\r\na necessity for abstinence, lying a-bed, and clysters. In every ignis\r\nsacer, neither mild and glutinous food, nor salt and acrid are proper;\r\nbut what is betwixt these: such as unleavened bread, fish, kid, birds,\r\nand except the wild boar, almost all venison. If there is no febricula,\r\nboth gestation and walking are serviceable, and rough wine, and the\r\nbath; and in this disorder, as well as that mentioned before, the drink\r\nought to be more plentiful than the food.\r\n\r\nAs for the ulcers themselves, if their progress be moderate, they\r\nmust be fomented with hot water; if more rapid, with hot wine. Next\r\nwherever there are any pustules, they must be opened with a needle.\r\nThen such applications used, as may consume the putrid flesh. When the\r\ninflammation is removed, and the ulcer cleansed, a lenient medicine\r\nought to be applied. In the second species, quinces boiled in wine\r\nand bruised may do good; as likewise the plaister of Hera, or the\r\ntetrapharmacum, with the addition of a fifth part of frankincense;\r\nlikewise black ivy boiled in a rough wine, and if the disorder spread\r\nfast, nothing is more efficacious. When the ulcer, which I observed to\r\nbe in the surface of the skin, is cleansed, the same lenient medicines\r\nare sufficient to the cure.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Of the Chironian ulcer._]\r\n\r\nThe ulcer named Chironian(83) is large, and has hard, callous, and\r\nswelled lips. A sanies is discharged not copious, but thin; the smell\r\nis bad. There is no inflammation either in the ulcer or in the tumour\r\nabout it. The pain is tolerable. It does not spread, and therefore is\r\nnot dangerous; but it does not easily heal. Sometimes a thin cicatrix\r\ncomes on, and then breaks again, and the ulcer is renewed. It occurs\r\nchiefly in the feet and legs.\r\n\r\nThe application to it ought to contain both something lenient, and\r\nsomething strong, and repellent. Such as the following composition made\r\nfor the purpose: of copper scales, calcined lead washed, each p. vi.\r\n*. cadmia, wax, each p. viii. *. oil of roses a sufficient quantity to\r\nsoften the wax with the other ingredients.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Of ulcers occasioned by cold._]\r\n\r\nThere is a kind of ulcer occasioned by the cold of the winter. It is\r\nmost common in children, chiefly in their feet and toes, sometimes\r\nalso in their hands. There is a redness with a moderate inflammation.\r\nSometimes pustules break out, which are followed by an ulceration.\r\nThe pain is not great, the itching greater. Sometimes a humour is\r\ndischarged, but in small quantity, which seems to resemble either pus\r\nor sanies.\r\n\r\nIn the first place it must be fomented plentifully with a hot decoction\r\nof turnips, or if these are not to be had, some of the repellent\r\nvervains. If it is not yet ulcerated, copper, as hot as a person is\r\nable to bear it, must be applied. When it is already ulcerated, allum,\r\npowdered with an equal quantity of frankincense, ought to be put to it,\r\nwith the addition of wine; or pomegranate bark boiled in water, then\r\nbeat. If the surface of the skin be excoriated, in that case lenient\r\nmedicines succeed best.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Of the scrophula._]\r\n\r\nThe scrophula is a tumour, in which there are formed some concretions\r\nof pus and blood, resembling small glands. These are extremely\r\ntroublesome to physicians, because they both generate fevers, and never\r\nmaturate kindly; and whether they be cured by incision or medicines,\r\nfor the most part they rise again close to the cicatrices; which they\r\nare much more ready to do, after being treated with medicines; and what\r\nis more, they are of long continuance. They grow chiefly in the neck;\r\nbut also in the armpits, the groin and the sides. Meges the surgeon\r\nassures us, that he has met with them in the breasts of women too.\r\n\r\nFor these reasons, it is proper to give internally white hellebore, and\r\nthat even frequently, till they be discussed; and externally to apply\r\nmedicines which may either draw out the humour, or discuss it; such as\r\nhave been mentioned before. Some also make use of caustics, which eat\r\ndown and constringe the part with an eschar; and then treat it like an\r\nulcer. Whatever method of cure be pursued, when the ulcer is clean, the\r\nbody must be exercised and nourished, till it come to a cicatrix. These\r\nare the methods prescribed by physicians(84): but the experience of\r\nsome peasants has discovered, that eating a snake cures a scrophulous\r\npatient.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Of a furuncle._]\r\n\r\nA furuncle is an acute tubercle, attended with inflammation and pain;\r\nand especially when it is just turning to pus. When this is opened,\r\nand the pus is discharged, part of the flesh below appears converted\r\ninto pus, part corrupted, of a whitish colour, and reddish; which some\r\ncall the ventricle of the furuncle. There is no danger in it, though no\r\nmeans be used for its cure, for it maturates of itself, and breaks. But\r\nthe pain makes a medicine, that can hasten the cure, eligible.\r\n\r\nThe proper medicine for it is galbanum, but other things have also been\r\nmentioned before. If none of these can be had, the first application\r\nought to be a plaister not greasy, to repel it; then if that has not\r\nsucceeded, something to promote a suppuration. If that cannot be got,\r\neither resin or leaven(85). When the pus is squeezed out, no further\r\ncure is necessary.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Of phymata._]\r\n\r\nThe name of phyma is given to a tubercle resembling a furuncle, but\r\nrounder, and flatter in the surface, and often larger. For a furuncle\r\nseldom rises to the bulk of half an egg, and never exceeds it: a phyma\r\nis commonly of greater extent; but the inflammation and pain in it\r\nare less. When it is broken, the pus appears in the same manner; no\r\nventricle is found here, as in the furuncle; but all the corrupted\r\nflesh is turned into pus. Now this grows more frequently in children,\r\nand is more easily cured; in young men it occurs more seldom, and is\r\nmore difficult to cure: when age has given firmness to the body, it\r\ndoes not appear at all. The proper medicines for discussing it have\r\nbeen mentioned before.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Of a phygethlon._]\r\n\r\nA phygethlon is a low, but broad tumour, in which there is something\r\nlike to a pustule. The pain and tension are violent, and greater than\r\nin proportion to the size of the tumour; sometimes also attended with\r\na slight fever. It ripens slowly, and no great part of it is converted\r\ninto pus. It is formed chiefly either in the neck, or in the armpits,\r\nor the groin. From its figure our authors call it panus(86). The\r\nproper medicine for this also we have pointed out before.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Of abscesses._]\r\n\r\nBut though all the foregoing are nothing else but small abscesses,\r\nyet a larger collection, that tends entirely to suppuration,\r\nappropriates to itself the general name of abscess. And this collection\r\nhappens generally after fevers or pains of some particular parts,\r\nand especially after pains in the belly. It commonly shews itself\r\nexternally, for it sometimes swells to a pretty large compass, like\r\nthe phyma, and is red and hot, and in a little time contracts a\r\nhardness. It is more troublesome as it advances, and occasions thirst\r\nand watchfulness. But sometimes there is none of these appearances in\r\nthe skin; and more especially when the suppuration is pretty deep; but\r\ninward prickings are felt, attended with thirst and watchfulness. It is\r\nmore kindly when it does not become hard of a sudden; and when, though\r\nit be ruddy, yet it is changing to a white colour. Which symptoms occur\r\nwhen the suppuration is beginning; for the swelling and redness comes\r\non long before.\r\n\r\nIf the abscess be forming in any of the nobler parts, the accession\r\nof matter there must be prevented by cataplasms, which are at the\r\nsame time repellent and cooling; such as I have mentioned under the\r\nerysipelas and elsewhere. If it is grown pretty hard, we must have\r\nrecourse to discutients and resolvents; such as a dry fig bruised, or\r\nlees of wine mixed with cerate, made up with hog’s lard; or the root of\r\nwild cucumber, with the addition of two parts of meal, first boiled in\r\nmulse. We may also mix equal parts of ammoniacum, galbanum, propolis,\r\nviscum, adding of myrrh not half the quantity of any of the other\r\ningredients: and the plaisters and malagmas I have mentioned before,\r\nhave the same effect.\r\n\r\nWhat is not discussed by these, must necessarily maturate. And to\r\nhasten this, must be applied barley meal mixed with water; to which\r\nalso it will be proper to add some herbs. The same applications(87)\r\nare fit for the lesser abscesses too, whose names and properties I have\r\nrecited above. The general method of cure is the same in them all; and\r\nonly differs in the degree. Now that tumour is crude, in which there\r\nappears a strong pulsation of the arteries, a weight, heat, tension,\r\npain, redness, and hardness; and if the abscess be large, a shuddering,\r\nas also a slight fever continues; and the suppuration being pretty deep\r\nand concealed, instead of the marks, which otherwise shew themselves\r\nin the skin, there are prickings. When these have abated, and the part\r\nbegins to itch, and either becomes somewhat livid or whitish, the\r\nsuppuration, is perfected. And when it either breaks of itself, or is\r\nopened by medicines, or by incision, the pus ought to be discharged.\r\nAnd if it happens in the armpits or groin, it must be dressed without\r\nlint. In other parts too, if it is narrow at the bottom, if the\r\nsuppuration has been moderate, if it has not penetrated deep, if there\r\nis no fever, if the patient be strong, lint is equally needless. In\r\nother circumstances it ought to be used, sparingly however, and not\r\nunless the wound be large. It does well to spread honey upon the lint;\r\nor without it, to apply lentils with honey, or pomegranate bark boiled\r\nwith wine. And these things are proper both alone and mixed.\r\n\r\nIf any parts round it should be too hard, to soften them may be applied\r\neither mallows beat, or fenugreek, or lintseed boiled in passum. And\r\nthen whatever is to be applied, ought to be secured not by a tight,\r\nbut an easy bandage. Every body ought to know, that in this kind of\r\ndisorder cerate may be used. What else belongs to the cleansing of the\r\nulcer, filling it up, and bringing on a cicatrix, and equally relates\r\nto wounds, has been already pointed out.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Of fistulas._]\r\n\r\nBut sometimes from abscesses of this kind and other ulcers, arise\r\nfistulas. That is the name of a deep, narrow and callous ulcer. It\r\noccurs almost in every part of the body; and it has some peculiarities\r\nin each place. I shall first treat of the general properties. There\r\nare then several kinds of fistulas; for some are short, others deeper;\r\nsome point inward in a straight line; others, and by far the greatest\r\npart, are transverse; some are simple, others are double, or triple,\r\nwhich beginning from one orifice, branch out within, into three or\r\nmore sinuses; some straight, others bent and tortuous; some end in the\r\nflesh, others penetrate to bones or a cartilage; or where neither of\r\nthese lies beyond them, reach to the more internal parts; some again\r\nare easily cured, others with difficulty, and some are even found\r\nincurable.\r\n\r\nThe cure of a simple and recent fistula in the flesh is easy. It is an\r\nadvantage to it, if the person be young, and the constitution firm:\r\nthe contrary are very unfavourable circumstances; as also if the\r\nfistula has injured a bone, or cartilage, or nerve, or muscles; if it\r\nhave seized upon a joint, or has penetrated either to the bladder, or\r\nthe lungs, or to the womb, or to the large veins or arteries, or to\r\nthe jaw-bones, throat, stomach, or thorax. When it points towards the\r\nintestines too, it is always dangerous, and often mortal. In these\r\ncases it greatly increases the malady, if the patient be either sick,\r\nor old, or of a bad habit.\r\n\r\nFirst of all, it is proper to put a probe into the fistula, that we\r\nmay find its direction and depth: and at the same time whether it\r\nbe altogether moist, or drier than it should be, which appears upon\r\ndrawing out the probe. It may also be determined, whether the bone be\r\naffected or not; and if the fistula has penetrated there, how far it\r\nhas injured it. For if that part is soft, which is touched by the end\r\nof the probe, the disorder is confined to the flesh; if it resists\r\nmore, it has made way to the bone. And again, if the probe slides,\r\nthere is no caries begun: if it does not slip out(88) of the point\r\nwhere it is placed, the caries is begun, but is slight yet: if it feels\r\nunequal also, and rough, the bone is very much corroded. The situation\r\nitself shews when there is a cartilage below; and that the fistula has\r\nreached it, appears by its resistance.\r\n\r\nNow from these circumstances may be learnt the seats and extents of\r\nfistulas, and what parts they have damaged. From the quantity of\r\nthe pus it may be known, whether they be simple, or divided into\r\nmore parts. If more of that comes away, than can issue from a single\r\ncavity, it is evident there are more sinuses. And as flesh, nerves,\r\nand some nervous substances, such as the greatest part of the coats\r\nand membranes are, commonly lie together, the nature of the pus will\r\ndiscover whether the several sinuses have eaten through these different\r\nsorts of bodies. For from flesh a smooth and white pus is discharged\r\npretty copiously; from a nervous place the discharge is of the same\r\ncolour indeed, but thinner, and less in quantity; from a nerve fat\r\nand not unlike to oil. Lastly, the posture of the body also discovers\r\nwhether the fistulas have penetrated into several parts, because often,\r\nwhen one lies down with his body and limb in a different position, the\r\npus begins to flow again, which had before stopped, and shews not only\r\nthat there is another sinus, from whence it descends, but also that it\r\nproceeds in a different direction.\r\n\r\nIf it be confined to the flesh, and is recent and simple, neither\r\nconsisting of sinuses, nor having a large cavity: also if it be not\r\nin a joint, but in a part, which is immoveable by itself, and is never\r\nput in motion but with the whole body, a plaister for recent wounds\r\nwill be sufficient, if that contain either salt, or allum, or copper\r\nscales, or verdigrease, or any of the metallic substances. And of this\r\na collyrium(89) ought to be made, at the one end smaller, and at\r\nthe other somewhat thicker. And this ought to be introduced with the\r\nsmall end foremost into the fistula, till pure blood begins to appear.\r\nThis is universal in the application of all collyriums for fistulas.\r\nAnd then the same plaister is to be put over it spread upon linen; and\r\nabove that must be applied a sponge first dipt in vinegar; and it is\r\nsufficient to open the dressings on the fifth day. Such diet must be\r\nused, as I have recommended for generating flesh.\r\n\r\nBut if the fistula is at a distance from the præcordia, it is necessary\r\nfor the patient now and then to eat radishes fasting and then to vomit.\r\n\r\nWhen the fistula by time becomes callous (and it is impossible to\r\nbe mistaken in a callosity, because it is hard, and either white or\r\npale) then there is a necessity for stronger medicines. Such as that\r\ncomposition, which contains of poppy tears p. i. *. gum p. iii. *.\r\ncadmia p. iv. *. copperas p. viii. *. these are incorporated with\r\nwater, and made into a collyrium. Or that, which consists of galls\r\np. i. *. verdigrease, sandarach, Egyptian allum, each p. i. *.\r\ncalcined copperas p. ii. *. Or that, which is composed of chalcitis\r\nand stone-lime, to which is added of orpiment less by one half than\r\neach of the other ingredients; and these are mixed up with boiled\r\nhoney. The most expeditious is the prescription of Meges: to reduce to\r\npowder of rasile verdigrease p. ii. *. then to dissolve in vinegar, of\r\nammoniacum thymiama p. ii. *. and with this to bring the verdigrease to\r\na consistence: and this is one of the choicest medicines. But though\r\nthe foregoing compositions are the most efficacious, yet if these are\r\nnot to be had, it is easy to destroy the callosity by some caustic\r\nmedicines: and it is sufficient to arm with these a twisted paper reed,\r\nor some part of a penecillum, formed after the manner of a collyrium.\r\nSquills also boiled, and mixed with lime consume a callus.\r\n\r\nIf the fistula happen to be pretty long, and transverse, after\r\nintroducing a probe, it is very proper to make an incision over against\r\nits origin, and to put in any collyrium you chuse.\r\n\r\nBut if we judge the fistula to have two or more sinuses, provided it\r\nbe short and confined to the flesh, we ought not to make use of a\r\ncollyrium, which may cure one part, and not touch the rest; but the\r\nsame medicines dry are to be put into a writing reed, which being\r\napplied to the orifice, the medicines must be blown into the fistula.\r\nOr the same things may be dissolved in wine; or if the fistula be\r\nsomewhat foul, in mulse; if somewhat, callous, in vinegar; and\r\nwhatever is injected, must be infused in this liquid form. Coolers\r\nand repellents must be applied above; for generally the parts about a\r\nfistula are a little inflamed. Neither is it improper, when one has\r\nremoved the dressings, before he make another injection, to wash the\r\nfistula by means of a syringe; if there be much matter, with wine; if\r\nthe callosity be pretty hard, with vinegar; if it is already cleansing,\r\nwith mulse, or a decoction of vetches in water, with a little honey\r\nadded to it. It commonly happens that the membrane, which is betwixt\r\nthe orifice and the sound flesh, being overcome by so many medicines,\r\ncasts off, and the ulcer is clean below. Whenever this happens,\r\nagglutinants are to be applied, and especially spunge armed with boiled\r\nhoney. I know it is a practice approved of by many in this case, to\r\nhave lint rolled up into the form of a collyrium, and dipt in honey,\r\nintroduced for incarning. But this method more quickly agglutinates,\r\nthan incarns. And there is no fear, that clean flesh brought into\r\ncontact with clean flesh can fail to unite, especially when medicines\r\nproper for that purpose are made use of; since often an ulceration of\r\nthe fingers, unless great care is taken to prevent it, will join them\r\ntogether in the healing.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Of the cerion ulcer._]\r\n\r\nThere is also a kind of ulcer, which from its resemblance to a\r\nhoneycomb, by the Greeks is called cerium[FE]. And of this there are\r\ntwo species: the one is of a whitish colour, and like to a furuncle,\r\nbut larger, and attended with great pain. When it maturates, it has\r\nopenings, through which is discharged a glutinous and purulent matter;\r\nnevertheless it does not come to a due ripeness. If it be divided by\r\nincision, there appears to be a great deal more corruption within, than\r\nin a furuncle, and it reaches deeper. It seldom occurs but amongst the\r\nhair of the head.\r\n\r\n  [FE] κηρίον.\r\n\r\nThe other is less, and eminent upon the top of the head, hard, broad,\r\nof a pale green colour, and more ulcerated; for there are openings\r\nat the roots of each of the hairs, through which issues a glutinous,\r\npalish humour, in consistence like honey, or viscum, or sometimes oil;\r\nand if an incision be made upon it, the flesh within appears green.\r\nThere is a great pain and inflammation, insomuch that they often bring\r\non an acute fever.\r\n\r\nTo that kind, which has fewer openings, it is proper to apply dry figs,\r\nand lintseed boiled in mulse, and drawing plaisters and malagmas, or\r\nthe medicines, of that quality above recited.\r\n\r\nUpon the other, the same medicines, likewise meal boiled in mulse, and\r\nhalf the quantity of turpentine resin added to it; and a fig boiled in\r\nmulse; to which a little powdered hyssop is added; likewise a fourth\r\npart of stavesacre added to the fig. But if medicines do but little\r\nservice in either kind, the whole ulcer must be cut out to the sound\r\nflesh. When the ulcer is taken away, medicines must be applied over the\r\nwound; first such as promote pus, next detergents, then such as incarn.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Of the acrochordon, acrothymium, myrmecia, and the clavus._]\r\n\r\nThere are also some resembling warts, which have different names, as\r\nthey are different disorders. The Greeks call that an acrochordon[FF],\r\nwhere a substance pretty hard is collected within the skin, which\r\nsometimes is rough, and of the same colour with the adjacent parts;\r\nnear the skin it is narrow, and broader above. This is small, rarely\r\nexceeding the size of a bean. They are hardly found to grow single;\r\ngenerally a number together, and chiefly in children. They sometimes\r\nsuddenly disappear, sometimes they excite a moderate inflammation. Some\r\nare also converted into pus.\r\n\r\n  [FF] ἀκροχορδὼν.\r\n\r\nThat is called acrothymium[FG], which rises like a small wart above\r\nthe flesh, broader at the skin, smaller above, hardish and very\r\nrough upon the top, where in colour it resembles thyme, whence it has\r\nits name; and it is easily divided there, and made bloody; sometimes\r\nit discharges some blood; and is generally about the bigness of an\r\nEgyptian bean, seldom larger, sometimes very small. Sometimes only one,\r\nat other times more grow in the palms of the hands, and soles of the\r\nfeet; they are worst in the private parts, and aptest to bleed there.\r\n\r\n  [FG] ἀκροθύμιον.\r\n\r\nThose called myrmecia[FH] are lower and harder than an acrothymium, fix\r\ntheir roots deeper, and occasion a greater pain; below they are broad,\r\nand above small, and less blood comes from them: in size they scarce\r\never exceed a lupine. These likewise grow either in the palms of the\r\nhands, or lower parts of the feet.\r\n\r\n  [FH] μυρμήκια.\r\n\r\nThe clavus grows elsewhere sometimes, but chiefly in the feet, and\r\nprincipally form a contusion, though sometimes from other causes; and\r\nit gives pain, if not at other times, at least when one is walking.\r\n\r\nOf these the acrochordon, and the acrothymium often terminate of\r\nthemselves, and the more readily, the less they are. Myrmecia and\r\nclavi are scarce ever removed without medicine. If the acrochordon be\r\ncut off, it leaves no root, and for reason does not grow again. When\r\nthe acrothymium and clavus are cut off, a small roundish root grows,\r\nwhich descends deep into the flesh, and that being left, they sprout up\r\nagain. The myrmecia adhere by very broad roots, and therefore cannot\r\nbe taken off without a great ulceration. It is very proper to pare the\r\nclavus now and then: for thus without any violence it grows soft: but\r\nif a little blood be let out, it often dies away. It is also removed,\r\nif one cleans it round, and then applies to it resin mixed with a\r\nlittle of the powder of a milstone. But the other kinds are to be eaten\r\naway by medicines. For the two first, that which is made from the lees\r\nof wine; for the myrmecia the most proper is that, which consists of\r\nalum and sandarach. But the contiguous parts ought to be covered with\r\nleaves, lest they also be corroded; and after that a lentil must be\r\napplied. A fig also boiled in water destroys an acrothymium.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Of pustules._]\r\n\r\nPustules break out chiefly in the spring season. Of these there are\r\nseveral kinds. For sometimes there is a certain asperity over the whole\r\nbody, or a part, resembling those pustules, which are occasioned by a\r\nnettle, or from sweat; the Greeks call them exanthemata[FI]. And they\r\nare sometimes red, at other times of the same colour with the skin.\r\nSometimes a great many grow resembling vari, sometimes larger. The\r\npustules are livid or pale, or black, or otherwise different from the\r\nnatural colour; and there is a humour contained in them. When they are\r\nbroke, the flesh below appears as it were ulcerated. By the Greeks they\r\nare called phlyctænæ helcodes[FJ]. They arise either from cold, or from\r\nfire, or from medicines.\r\n\r\n  [FI] ἐξανθήματα.\r\n\r\n  [FJ] φλύκταιναι ἑλκώδεις.\r\n\r\nThe phlyzacium[FK] is a pustule somewhat harder, of a whitish colour,\r\nand sharp pointed. What is squeezed from it is moist. The pustules\r\nsometimes turn to small ulcers, either dry or moist; and sometimes\r\nattended only with an itching, at other times with an inflammation\r\nand pain: pus or sanies issues from them, or both. And this occurs\r\nin children chiefly; seldom in the trunk of the body; often in the\r\nextremities.\r\n\r\n  [FK] φλυζάκιον.\r\n\r\nThe worst kind of pustule is that, which is called epinyctis[FL]. Its\r\ncolour either inclines to livid, or is a dark brown, or white. There\r\nis a violent inflammation round it; and when it is opened, a mucous\r\nulceration is found within, in colour resembling its humour. The pain\r\nof this is greater than in proportion to its bulk; for it is not\r\nlarger than a bean. And this likewise grows in the extremities, and\r\ngenerally in the night-time: whence the Greeks have given it the name\r\nof epinyctis.\r\n\r\n  [FL] ἐπινυκτὶς.\r\n\r\nNow in the cure of all pustules, the first thing is to walk much, and\r\nto take exercise: if that cannot be complied with, to use gestation.\r\nThe second rule is, to lessen the quantity of food; to abstain from\r\nevery thing acrid and extenuating. And nurses ought to observe the\r\nsame rules, if their sucking child is thus affected. Besides these,\r\none, that can bear it, if the pustules be small, ought to sweat in\r\nthe bagnio; and at the same time to sprinkle nitre over them; and\r\nto anoint the part with a mixture of wine and oil; then to go into\r\nthe bath. If no benefit accrues from these, or if the pustules be of\r\na larger kind, a lentil must be applied, and when the surface of the\r\nskin is taken off, we must have recourse to lenient medicines. After\r\nthe lentil, the epinyctis is to be treated with blood-herb, or green\r\ncoriander.\r\n\r\nThe ulcers formed from pustules are cured by litharge mixed with\r\nfenugreek seed; and in compounding them, rose oil, or juice of endive,\r\nare used alternately, till the mixture have the consistence of honey.\r\nThe proper composition for those pustules, which attack, infants, is of\r\nthat stone, which the Greeks call pyrites p. viii. *. with fifty bitter\r\nalmonds, and an addition of three cyathi of oil. But the pustules ought\r\nto be first rubbed with ceruss, and then anointed with this.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Of the scabies._]\r\n\r\nThe scabies is a hardness of the skin, of a muddy colour, from whence\r\npustules arise, some of them moist, others dry; from some of them\r\nissues a sanies; and in these there follows a continued itching\r\nulceration, which in certain cases spreads very fast. In some people\r\nit goes entirely off, in others it returns at a certain season of\r\nthe year; the greater its asperity, and the more it itches, the more\r\ndifficult it is to cure. And therefore this species of it the Greeks\r\ncall agria[FM], that is, cruel.\r\n\r\n  [FM] ἀγρία.\r\n\r\nIn this also the same diet is necessary, as above prescribed. The\r\nmedicine proper for this in its beginning, consists of spodium,\r\nsaffron, verdigrease, each p. i. *. white pepper, verjuice, each p.\r\ni. *. cadmia p. viii. *. But where there is already an ulceration,\r\nthat, which is composed of sulphur p. i. *. wax p. iv. *. liquid pitch\r\na hemina, two sextarii of oil. These must be boiled together to the\r\nconsistence of honey. There is also another, which is said to have\r\nbeen invented by Protarchus. It contains a sextarius of lupine meal,\r\nfour cyathi of nitre, a hemina of liquid pitch, half a pound of liquid\r\nresin, and three cyathi of vinegar. It is also proper to mix saffron,\r\nlycium, verdigrease, myrrh, ashes, in equal quantities, and boil them\r\nin passum. This heals every kind of scabies. And if there be nothing\r\nelse at hand, lees of oil boiled to a third part, or sulphur mixed with\r\nliquid pitch, as I prescribed for cattle, relieve men also labouring\r\nunder the scabies.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Of the impetigo._]\r\n\r\nOf the impetigo there are four species. The least malignant is that,\r\nwhich resembles the scabies. For it is red, hardish, ulcerated,\r\nand corrosive. But it differs widely from that, which is more\r\nulcerated(90), and has pustules like to vari; and there appear to be\r\nin it somewhat like air bubbles, from which, after a time, something\r\nlike scales come off; and this is more certain in its returns.\r\n\r\nThe second kind is worse, and is not unlike the papula, but of greater\r\nasperity and a more ruddy colour, having various figures; scales fall\r\noff from the surface of the skin, there is a greater erosion, it\r\nspreads more quickly, and broader, and both comes and goes at more\r\ncertain intervals than the former. It is called the red.\r\n\r\nThe third kind is still worse. For it is both thicker and harder,\r\nand more swelled; it causes fissures in the surface of the skin, and\r\ncorrodes more vehemently. This also is scaly, but black; it spreads\r\nwide(91), and does not stay long at a time; but is less uncertain as\r\nto its periods of coming and going; and is not to be entirely removed.\r\nThis has the epithet of the black.\r\n\r\nThere is a fourth kind absolutely incurable, very different from the\r\nrest in colour. For it is whitish, and resembling a recent cicatrix; it\r\nhas scales of a pale colour, some whitish, others resembling a lentil;\r\nwhich being taken off, blood sometimes follows. Otherwise the humour of\r\nit is white, the skin is hard and chopped, and it spreads wider.\r\n\r\nAll these kinds happen chiefly in the feet and hands; and they also\r\ninfest the nails. There is no medicine more efficacious than that I\r\nmentioned for the scabies, which bears the name of Protarchus. Serapion\r\nmade use of the following composition, nitre p. ii. *. sulphur p. iv.\r\n*. incorporated with plenty of resin.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Of the papula._]\r\n\r\nThere are two species of the papula. One is, where the skin is made\r\nrough by very small pustules, and is both red, and gently corroded; in\r\nthe midst of them is a space somewhat smoother; it spreads slowly. And\r\nthis disorder is of a round form in its beginning, and proceeds in the\r\nsame manner circularly.\r\n\r\nThe second, the Greeks call agria: which has a similar appearance,\r\nbut the skin is more unequal and ulcerated, and it corrodes more\r\nvehemently, is redder, and sometimes also loosens the hairs.\r\n\r\nThat which is less round, heals with greater difficulty; and unless it\r\nbe cured, it turns to an impetigo. But a slight papula, if it be rubbed\r\nevery day with fasting spittle, will heal. The greater kind is very\r\nwell cured by feverfew rubbed over it. But for the compound medicines,\r\nthat same prescription abovementioned of Protarchus is so much the more\r\npowerful here, as the distemper is less. There is another of Mico’s for\r\nthe same purpose; of red nitre, frankincense, each p. i. *. cantharides\r\ncleansed p. ii. *. crude sulphur a like quantity, liquid turpentine\r\nresin p. xx. *. meal of darnel three sextantes, three cyathi of git,\r\nand one sextans of crude pitch.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Of the vitiligo._]\r\n\r\nThe vitiligo also, though of itself not dangerous, yet is both nasty,\r\nand proceeds from a bad habit of body. There are three species of it.\r\nIt is called alphos[FN], when it is white; it is commonly a little\r\nrough, and not continued, but appears like drops dispersed here and\r\nthere. Sometimes it spreads wider, leaving some, places between free.\r\nThe melas[FO] differs from that in colour, being black, and like a\r\nshadow. In other respects it is the same. The leuce[FP] has some\r\nresemblance to the alphos, but is whiter, and penetrates deeper;\r\nand has white downy hairs in it. All these spread; but in some more\r\nquickly, in others slower. The alphos and melas come and go in some\r\npeople without any regularity. The leuce does not easily quit a person\r\nit has once seized.\r\n\r\n  [FN] ἄλφος.\r\n\r\n  [FO] μέλας.\r\n\r\n  [FP] λεύκη.\r\n\r\nThe two first are not very difficult to cure; the last scarce ever\r\nheals; and though the disorder be in some degree mitigated, yet the\r\nnatural colour is never fully restored. Whether any of these be curable\r\nor not, is easily known from an experiment. For the skin should be cut,\r\nor pricked with a needle. If blood issues, which generally happens in\r\nthe two former, there is room for a remedy; if a white humour starts,\r\nit will not admit of a cure. And therefore it should not he meddled\r\nwith.\r\n\r\nTo the curable kinds must be applied lentils mixed with sulphur and\r\nfrankincense, the lentils being bruised and dipped in vinegar. Another\r\ncomposition for the same purpose is that, which goes under the name of\r\nIrenæus. Bastard spunge, nitre, cummin, dry fig-leaves, of each equal\r\nparts, are bruised with the addition of vinegar. With this the part\r\naffected is anointed in the sun; and in a little time, it is washed\r\noff, lest it corrode too much. Some following the practice of Mico,\r\nanoint the alphi with the following medicine; they mix of sulphur p.\r\nii. *. nitre p. iv. *. dry myrrh powdered an acetabulum; then in the\r\nbath sprinkle upon the vitiligo bean flour, and afterwards put the\r\nother over it. Those which I called melanes, are cured by the following\r\nthings beat up together; bastard spunge, frankincense, barley, and\r\nbeans; these are sprinkled upon them without oil in the bagnio, before\r\na sweat comes on, and then that species of vitiligo comes off by\r\nrubbing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA. CORNELIUS CELSUS\r\n\r\n        OF\r\n\r\n     MEDICINE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_BOOK VI._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. I.\r\n\r\n\r\nHaving done with the disorders, which break out in any part of the body\r\nindifferently, and require the assistance of medicines; I shall now\r\nproceed to those, that are confined to particular parts, beginning with\r\nthe head.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Of hairs falling off the head._]\r\n\r\nWhen the hairs of the head fall off, the principal remedy is frequent\r\nshaving: though labdanum mixed with oil, conduces also towards keeping\r\nthem on. I here speak of the hair, which falls off after an illness.\r\nFor no remedy whatever can prevent the heads of some people from\r\nbecoming bald by age.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. II.\r\n\r\nOF A PORRIGO.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe call that disorder a porrigo, _scurf_, when certain small scales\r\narise amongst the hair, and are loosened from the skin; they are\r\nsometimes moist, much more frequently dry. It happens sometimes\r\nwithout any ulcer, sometimes in a part that is ulcerated, and is\r\nsometimes attended with a bad smell, sometimes with none. It usually\r\noccurs in the hair of the head, more rarely in the beard, sometimes\r\nalso in the eye-brows. And as it never comes without some antecedent\r\ndisorder in the body, so it is not altogether useless. For when the\r\nhead is free from disorders, then it does not appear: when there is\r\nany disorder there, it is more expedient, _in such a case_, that the\r\nsurface of the skin should be here and there corrupted, than that the\r\nnoxious matter should be turned in upon a more noble part.\r\n\r\nIt is more proper then to cleanse it by frequent combing, than to repel\r\nit entirely. But if that method makes it more offensive (which may\r\nhappen by the excessive discharge of humour, and more so, if the humour\r\nbe fetid) the head is to be shaved often; and treated with some gentle\r\nrepellents, such as nitre with vinegar, or labdanum with myrtle oil,\r\nand wine, or myrobalans with wine. If these have little effect, we may\r\nuse some of the more powerful ones; but, at the same time, we should be\r\naware, that this practice is hurtful, when the disorder is recent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. III.\r\n\r\nOF THE SYCOSIS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is an ulcer, which from its resemblance to a fig, by the Greeks,\r\nis called sycosis[FQ], because flesh sprouts up from it. And this is\r\nthe general name. Under it are included two species. The one is a hard\r\nand round ulcer; the other is moist and unequal in its surface. From\r\nthe hard one the discharge is very small and glutinous; from the moist,\r\nit is in greater quantity and fetid. Both kinds occur in the parts\r\ncovered with hair: but that which is callous and round, most frequently\r\nin the beard; the other, which is moist, chiefly in the hair of the\r\nhead.\r\n\r\n  [FQ] σύκωσις.\r\n\r\nTo both of them it is proper to apply elaterium, or lintseed powdered,\r\nand made into a paste with water, or a fig boiled in water, or the\r\ntetrapharmacum plaister softened with vinegar. Eretrian earth also\r\nliquified with vinegar is proper to lay upon them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. IV.\r\n\r\nOF AREAE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are two kinds of areae. Both of them agree in this, that the\r\nsurface of the skin mortifying, the hairs first decay, and then fall\r\noff; and if the part is wounded, thin and fetid blood is discharged;\r\nand both kinds increase in some people quickly, in others slowly. It is\r\nthen worst, when it has rendered the skin thick and fat, and entirely\r\nsmooth. That, which is called alopecia[FR], spreads in no certain form.\r\nIt is found both in the hair of the head, and in the beard. But that,\r\nwhich from its likeness to a serpent is called ophiasis[FS], begins at\r\nthe hinder part of the head; its breadth not exceeding two fingers; it\r\ncreeps with two heads to the ears; in some, even to the forehead, till\r\nthe two heads are joined in the fore part. The former species happens\r\nat any age; the latter commonly to infants. The first hardly ever\r\nterminates without medicine; the other often goes away of itself.\r\n\r\n  [FR] ἀλωπεκία.\r\n\r\n  [FS] ὀφίασις.\r\n\r\nSome scarify these kinds of areae gently with a knife. Others anoint\r\nthem with escharotic medicines mixed with oil; and especially burnt\r\npaper. Others apply turpentine resin with thapsia. But nothing is\r\nbetter than daily shaving with a razor; because, when the cuticula is\r\ngradually cut off, the small roots of the hairs are laid bare. Nor\r\nshould this be given over, till it appears, that the hair grows thick.\r\nIt is sufficient to rub the part, that is frequently shaved, with\r\ncopperas.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. V.\r\n\r\nOF VARI, LENTICULAE, AND EPHELIDES.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is almost a folly to cure vari, lenticulae, and ephelides: but\r\nit is impossible to prevent women from being nice in what regards\r\ntheir beauty. Of these disorders, which I have just mentioned, vari\r\nand lenticulae are universally known; however, that species is more\r\nrare, which the Greeks call phacia[FT], though that is only of a more\r\nruddy colour, and more unequal surface than the common lenticula. The\r\nephelis[FU] is unknown to most people; and is nothing else than a\r\ncertain ill coloured asperity and hardness. The others are peculiar to\r\nthe face; the lenticulae sometimes appear in other parts, of which I\r\ndid not think it worth while to treat separately elsewhere.\r\n\r\n  [FT] φακία.\r\n\r\n  [FU] ἐφηλὶς.\r\n\r\nBut vari are well cured by the application of resin mixed with an equal\r\nquantity of scissile alum, and a little honey. Equal quantities of\r\ngalbanum and nitre, beat up with vinegar to the consistence of honey,\r\nremove a lenticula. The part is to be rubbed with these, and after an\r\ninterval of several hours, washed clean in the morning, and gently\r\nanointed with oil.\r\n\r\nAn ephelis is cured by resin, with the addition of a third part of\r\nfossile salt and a little honey. And for all these disorders, and\r\nlikewise for giving a proper colour to cicatrices, that composition\r\nis good, which is said to be invented by Tryphon the father. In it\r\nthere are equal parts of myrobalans crocomagma, the bluish Cimolian\r\nchalk(92), bitter almonds, flour of barley, and vetches, white\r\nstruthium, seed of mellilot: all these are powdered and brought to\r\na consistence with the bitterest honey, and being rubbed on in the\r\nevening, are always washed off in the morning.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. VI.\r\n\r\nOF THE DISORDERS OF THE EYES.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe foregoing are indispositions of small account. But our eyes are\r\nexposed to grievous and various maladies. And because they contribute\r\nso large a share both to the conveniency and pleasure of life, they\r\ndeserve our utmost care to preserve them.\r\n\r\nPresently after the appearance of a lippitude, there are certain\r\nindications, from which we may form a presage of the event. For, if\r\na discharge of tears, and a tumour, and a thick gum too(2) have\r\ncommenced at once; if that gum is mixed with tears, and the tears are\r\nnot hot, also if the gum is white and soft, and the tumour not hard,\r\nthere is no danger of the disorder continuing long. But if the tears\r\nare copious, and hot, the gum little in quantity, the tumour small, and\r\nthese are confined to one eye; the case will prove tedious, but without\r\ndanger. And this species of lippitude is not at all painful; but is\r\nhardly ever removed before the twentieth day; sometimes it continues\r\nfor two months, and sometimes not so long.\r\n\r\nIf the gum begins to be white and soft, and is mixed with tears, or\r\nboth these have attacked the two eyes at once; the lippitude may be\r\nof shorter continuance, but there is a danger of ulcers. Now a dry\r\nand parched gum occasions pain, but terminates sooner; unless it have\r\nproduced some ulcer.\r\n\r\nA large tumour, if it be without pain, and dry, is void of all danger;\r\nif it be dry, but attended with pain, it commonly ulcerates; and\r\nsometimes, from this case it happens, that the eye-lid is agglutinated\r\nto the eye. There is room also to fear an ulceration in the eye-lids or\r\nthe pupil, when besides great pain, there is a discharge of salt and\r\nhot tears; or even when after the tumour is removed, the tears flow for\r\na long time mixed with the gum.\r\n\r\nIt is worse still, where the gum is pale or livid, the tears are\r\nscalding, or in great quantity, the head hot, and the pain reaches\r\nfrom the temples to the eyes, also if the person is distressed with\r\nwakefulness in the night; for in such circumstances, generally the eye\r\nbursts, when it were to be wished, it would only ulcerate. A slight\r\nfever is of service to an eye that bursts inwardly. If it breaks and\r\nis protruded externally, the case admits of no remedy. If from a black\r\ncolour, some part of it has become whitish, it continues long. But if\r\nit be rough and thick, even after the cure, it leaves some mark.\r\n\r\nHippocrates, the most ancient author we have, has observed in his\r\nwritings, that the eyes are cured by bleeding, by medicines, the bath,\r\nfomentations, and drinking of wine. But he has not explained the proper\r\ntime for these, and the reasons for their use; in which the principal\r\npart of medicine consists. There is also much benefit received from\r\nabstinence and clysters.\r\n\r\nThey are sometimes seized with an inflammation; in which they are\r\nat once pained and swelled; and there follows a discharge of gum;\r\nsometimes more, sometimes less plentiful, or acrid. In such a case,\r\nthe principal remedies are rest and abstinence. Wherefore, for the\r\nfirst day, the patient ought to lie in a dark place, and even refrain\r\nfrom speaking; to take no food at all; if he can command himself, not\r\nso much as water; if he cannot do that, at least as little of it as\r\npossible.\r\n\r\nBut if the pains are severe, blood must be taken away, and preferably\r\non the second day; but if the case be urgent, on the first; especially\r\nif the veins in the forehead swell, the patient be strong, and there\r\nis a redundancy of matter: but if the illness be less severe, it calls\r\nfor a milder cure. It is not necessary to give a clyster, till the\r\nsecond or third day. But a small inflammation requires neither of these\r\nremedies; and it is sufficient to rest and fast.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, long fasting is not proper in lippitudes, lest it render\r\nthe gum more fetid and acrid; but on the second day, some of the\r\ngentlest of those things, that generate a thicker phlegm(3), ought\r\nto be given, such as sorbile eggs; if the disorder be but slight,\r\npulticula, or bread sopped in milk. On the following days, as much\r\nas the inflammation decreases, so much may the quantity of food be\r\nincreased; but of the same kind; so that above all, nothing salt, or\r\nacrid, or extenuating be taken; and nothing be used for drink but\r\nwater. And with respect to diet, such a regimen is highly necessary.\r\n\r\nNow on the first day of the distemper, it is proper to mix p. i. *. of\r\nsaffron, and p. ii. *. of the finest, whitest flour, with the white of\r\nan egg to the consistence of honey; and to spread this upon a piece of\r\nlinen, and apply it to the forehead, that by compressing the veins,\r\nit may restrain the violent flux of gum. If saffron cannot be had,\r\nfrankincense has the same effect. It makes no difference whether it be\r\nspread upon a bit of linen, or wool. The eyes ought to be anointed with\r\nthe following composition: as much saffron as can be held with three\r\nfingers, myrrh, the bigness of a bean, of poppy tears, the bigness of a\r\nlentil, are rubbed down together with passum, and daubed over the eyes\r\nwith a probe. Another for the same purpose consists of myrrh, p. i. *.\r\nmandrake juice p. ii. *. poppy tears p. ii. *. rose leaves, hemlock\r\nseed, each p. iii. *. acacia p. iv. *. gum p. viii. *. And these are\r\napplied in the day time; but in the night, for promoting rest, it is\r\nnot improper to lay on the crumb of white bread mixed up with wine. For\r\nthat both restrains the flux of gum, and if any tears are discharged,\r\nit absorbs them, and does not suffer the eyes to be glued up.\r\n\r\nIf the pain of the eyes be so great as to make this application uneasy\r\nand too hard, both the white and yolk of an egg must be dropped into a\r\ncup, and a little mulse added to them, and these mixed with the finger;\r\nwhen they are incorporated, soft wool combed, ought to be dipped in\r\nit, and saturated with it, and applied over the eyes. This is light,\r\nand by cooling restrains the gum; besides, it does not grow dry, nor\r\nsuffer the eye to be glued. Barley-meal also boiled and mixed with a\r\nboiled quince is a proper application. And it is no absurd practice to\r\nuse rather a pencillum squeezed out of water, if the disorder be less\r\nsevere, if more so, out of vinegar and water. The former applications\r\nare to be bound on with a roller, lest they fall off in the time of\r\nsleep: but it is sufficient to lay the pencillum on the eyes; both\r\nbecause it can be conveniently replaced by the patient himself, and\r\nbecause, when it has grown dry, it must be moistened again. If the\r\ndisorder is so great as to prevent sleep for a long time, some of\r\nthe medicines are to be given, which the Greeks call anodyne: and\r\nfor a boy, the bigness of a vetch is a sufficient dose; for a man,\r\nthe bigness of a bean. On the first day, it is not fit to inject any\r\nthing into the eye, unless the inflammation be very great: for the\r\ngum is often rather invited than diminished by that means. But on the\r\nsecond day, even in a severe lippitude, it is proper to relieve by\r\nthe injection of medicines, when either the patient has been bled, or\r\na clyster has been given; or it appears, that neither of these was\r\nnecessary.\r\n\r\nThere are many collyriums proper for this purpose, invented by\r\ndifferent authors; and new ones may still be made; since lenient and\r\ngently repelling medicines may be easily mixed in various proportions.\r\nI shall mention the most celebrated of them.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Philon’s collyrium._]\r\n\r\nThe collyrium of Philon contains of washed ceruss, spodium, gum, each\r\np. i. *. poppy tears toasted p. i. *. It is fit to know, that all the\r\ningredients must first be powdered separately, after that mixed and\r\nbeat up again, dropping in from time to time, either water or some\r\nother liquid. Gum, as it possesses some other qualities, so has this\r\npeculiar effect upon collyriums, that when they have been long made,\r\nand are grown dry, they continue firmly united, and are not friable.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Dionysius’s._]\r\n\r\nDionysius’s collyrium: of poppy tears toasted till tender p. i. *.\r\ntoasted frankincense, gum, each p. ii. *. spodium p. iv. *.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Cleon’s._]\r\n\r\nCleon’s is a very famous one: of poppy tears toasted p. i. *. saffron\r\np. i. *. gum p. *. v. to these, while they are powdered, is added juice\r\nof roses. Another, by the same, stronger; of iron scales, which is\r\ncalled stomoma[FV] p. i. *. saffron p. ii. *. spodium p. iv. *. lead,\r\nboth washed and calcined p. i. *. and the same quantity of gum. There\r\nis still another of the same author’s, chiefly useful where there is\r\na great flux of gum: of castor p. *. i. aloes p. *. i. myrrh p. *.\r\nii. prepared cadmia p. viii. *. a like quantity of antimony, juice of\r\nacacia p. xii. *. the mixture may be kept in a small box. But Theodotus\r\nadded to this composition toasted poppy tears p. *. i. copper calcined\r\nand washed p. ii. *. date kernels toasted p. x. *. gum p. xii. *.\r\n\r\n  [FV] στόμωμα.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _The acharistum of Theodotus._]\r\n\r\nBut Theodotus’s own, which by some is called acharistum[FW], is thus\r\nmade: of castor, Indian nard, each p. i. *. lycium p. *. poppy tears\r\nthe same quantity; myrrh p. ii. *. saffron, washed ceruss, aloes, each\r\np. iii. *. cadmia botryitis washed, calcined copper, each p. viii. *.\r\ngum p. xviii. *. juice of acacia, p. xx. *. antimony the same quantity;\r\nto these is added rain water.\r\n\r\n  [FW] ἀχάριστον.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _The cythion, or tephrion._]\r\n\r\nBesides these, amongst the most common collyriums is that, which some\r\ncall cythion, others from its ash colour, teprion. It contains of\r\nstarch, tragacanth, acacia juice, gum, each p. i. *. poppy tears p. ii.\r\n*. washed ceruss p. iv. *. washed litharge p. viii. *. these in the\r\nsame manner are beat up with rain water.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _The trygodes of Euelpides._]\r\n\r\nEuelpides, who was the greatest oculist in our age, made use of one,\r\nwhich he had composed himself, and called it trygodes. It contains of\r\ncastor p. ii. *. lycium, nard, poppy tears, each p. i. *. saffron,\r\nmyrrh, aloes, each p. iv. *. calcined copper p. viii. *. cadmia and\r\nantimony, each p. xii. *. acacia juice p. xxvi. *. gum the same\r\nquantity.\r\n\r\nThe more violent any inflammation is, so much the more it requires to\r\nbe alleviated by medicines, with the addition either of the white of an\r\negg, or breast milk. But if neither a physician nor a medicine can be\r\ngot, it mitigates the disorder to infuse either of these into the eyes\r\nby a penecillum made for the purpose. But when relief is obtained, and\r\nthe flux of gum stops, the slight relics of the disorder, that might\r\nperhaps otherwise continue, are discussed by bathing and drinking wine.\r\nTherefore the patient ought to bathe moderately, being first rubbed\r\nover with old oil, and longer in his legs and thighs than the rest of\r\nhis body; and to foment his eyes with plenty of warm water; next to\r\nhave warm water first, and afterwards water with the cold just taken\r\noff, poured over his head; after bathing, he must guard against being\r\nexposed to cold, or wind. After this, his diet ought to be somewhat\r\nfuller than formerly(4); but he should abstain from all extenuants\r\nof phlegm: the wine he drinks should be mild, inclining to rough, of\r\na moderate age; and in this he ought neither to indulge to excess, nor\r\nbe too sparing, that the former extreme may not occasion crudity, but\r\nthat by a just quantity sleep may be procured, and the acrimony lurking\r\nwithin may be sheathed. But if a person in the bath has felt more\r\nuneasiness in his eyes than he did before (which usually happens to\r\nthose, who have made too much haste to get into it, while the flux of\r\ngum still continued) he ought to come out immediately; to drink no wine\r\nthat day; and eat even less than he did the day before. Afterwards,\r\nas soon as the discharge of gum is sufficiently stopt, he must return\r\nagain to the use of the bath.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, it sometimes happens, from some unfavourable circumstance\r\neither in the weather, or habit of the patient, that for several days\r\nneither the pain, nor the inflammation, and least of all, the discharge\r\nof gum ceases. When this is the case, and time itself has brought\r\nthe disorder to a full maturity for it, relief is to be sought from\r\nthe same remedies, that is, the bath and wine. For though they are\r\nhurtful, while these complaints are recent, because they may irritate\r\nand inflame them; yet in the inveterate, which have not yielded to any\r\nother remedies, they are commonly very efficacious. For in this, as\r\nwell as in other cases, when seemingly proper medicines have been tried\r\nin vain, those of a contrary nature give relief. But it is expedient\r\nfor the patient, in the first place, to have his hair clipped close\r\nto the skin; next, to foment his head and eyes in the bath, very\r\nplentifully, with warm water; then to wipe both with a penecillum, and\r\nanoint his head with ointment of iris; to lie in bed, till all the\r\nheat acquired in the bath is gone off, and the sweat cease, which was\r\nnecessarily collected in his head. Then he should make use of the same\r\nkind of food and wine above recommended, the latter undiluted; and\r\ncover his head, and continue at rest. For after these, either a sound\r\nsleep, or a sweat, or a purging, often puts an end to the discharge\r\nof gum. If the disorder abates (which sometimes does not happen soon)\r\nthe same course ought to be pursued for several days, till the cure\r\nbe completed. If, on these days, he has no stool, a clyster must be\r\ninjected for relieving the superior parts.\r\n\r\nBut sometimes a great inflammation arises, and of so violent a nature,\r\nthat it propels the eyes from their cavity. The Greeks call this\r\nproptosis[FX], because the eyes fall forward. It is plain such patients\r\nrequire bleeding, if their strength will admit of it: if that cannot be\r\ndone, a clyster is necessary, and long fasting. The mildest medicines\r\nare required _in this case_. Therefore, some use the first of Cleon’s\r\ntwo collyriums mentioned above. But that of Nileus is the best, and all\r\nauthors agree to give it the preference to any other.\r\n\r\n  [FX] πρόπτωσις.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Nileus’s collyrium._]\r\n\r\nIt is this: Indian nard, poppy tears, of each p. *. gum p. i. *.\r\nsaffron p. ii. *. fresh rose leaves, p. iv. *. which are brought to a\r\nconsistence, either by rain water, or light wine, inclining to rough.\r\nAnd it is not improper to boil pomegranate bark, or melilot, in wines,\r\nthen to bruise it; or to mix black myrrh with rose leaves; or henbane\r\nleaves boiled with the white of an egg; or meal, with acacia juice,\r\nor passum, or mulse. And if poppy leaves too be added, they will be\r\nsomewhat more efficacious. When some one of these is prepared, the eyes\r\nought to be fomented with a penecillum squeezed out of a warm decoction\r\nof myrtle or rose leaves in water; after that, the medicine is to be\r\napplied. Besides, the skin in the back of the head is to be cut, and a\r\ncupping vessel applied to it.\r\n\r\nIf, by these means, the eye is not restored to its place, but\r\ncontinues prominent as before, we may conclude the eye-sight is gone;\r\nand that the eye will next grow hard, or be converted into pus. If\r\nthe suppuration appears in that angle, which is next the temple, an\r\nincision must be made in the eye, that vent being given to the matter,\r\nthe inflammation and pain may cease, and the coats _of the eye_ fall\r\ninward, so that the face may be less disfigured afterwards. And then\r\nmust be used, either the same collyriums with milk, or an egg; or else\r\nsaffron mixed with the white of an egg. But if it has grown hard, and\r\nis mortified, without turning to pus, so much of it must be scooped\r\nout, as to prevent a shocking projection; which must be done thus. The\r\nexternal coat must be laid hold of with a hook, and below that the\r\nincision made with a knife; then these medicines are to be injected,\r\ntill the pain be entirely gone. The same medicines are also necessary\r\nfor an eye, that is first protruded, and afterwards bursts in several\r\nplaces.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Of carbuncles of the eyes._]\r\n\r\nIt is not uncommon for carbuncles to proceed from an inflammation,\r\nsometimes in the eyes themselves, sometimes in their lids; and in the\r\nlast, they are sometimes in the inside, at other times on the outside.\r\nIn this case, a clyster must be given; the quantity of food lessened;\r\nmilk allowed for drink; that the offending acrimony may be sheathed.\r\nAs to cataplasms and medicines, we must use such as have been proposed\r\nagainst inflammations. And here also the collyrium of Nileus is the\r\nbest. But if the carbuncle be on the external part of the eye-lid,\r\nlintseed boiled in mulse is the most proper for a cataplasm; or if that\r\nis not to be had, wheat meal boiled in the same manner.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Of pustules of the eyes._]\r\n\r\nSometimes pustules also proceed from inflammations. If this happens in\r\nthe beginning of the inflammation, the former directions about bleeding\r\nand rest are even to be more punctually observed; if later than to\r\nadmit of bleeding, yet a clyster must be given. If for any reasons that\r\nlikewise is impracticable, at least the proper diet must be used. In\r\nthis case too, the mild medicines are necessary; such as that of Nileus\r\nor Cleon.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Collyrium of Philes._]\r\n\r\nThe collyrium which takes its name from Philes, is also suited to this\r\ndisorder. For it contains of myrrh, poppy tears, each p. i. *. washed\r\nlead, Samian earth, which is called after, tragacanth, each p. iv. *.\r\nburnt antimony(5), starch, each p. vi. *. washed spodium, washed\r\nceruss, each p. viii. *, which are incorporated with rain water. This\r\ncollyrium is used mixed either with an egg, or milk.\r\n\r\nFrom pustules sometimes are generated ulcers; and these, when recent,\r\nare to be dressed with the like lenient medicines, and mostly the same\r\nas I have prescribed above for pustules. There is also a particular\r\napplication for them, which is called dialibanou[FY]. It contains of\r\ncopper calcined and washed, poppy tears toasted, each p. i. *. spodium\r\nwashed, frankincense, antimony calcined and washed, myrrh and gum, each\r\np. ii. *.\r\n\r\n  [FY] διὰ λιβάνου.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Wasting of the eyes._]\r\n\r\nIt happens likewise, that the eyes, either one or both, become less\r\nthan they ought to be naturally. And this is caused by an acrid flux of\r\ngum in a lippitude, also by continual weeping, and wounds badly cured.\r\nIn such cases, the same mild medicines with breast milk are to be used;\r\nand such food as most nourishes and fills the body; and the patient\r\nmust carefully avoid whatever occasions weeping, and all the anxiety of\r\ndomestic affairs: and if any misfortune happens likely to disturb him,\r\nit must be concealed from his knowledge: acrid medicines and acrid food\r\nhurt by occasioning tears, as much as any other way.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Lice in the eye-lids._]\r\n\r\nThere is a peculiar kind of disorder, in which lice are generated\r\namongst the hair of the eye lids. This the Greeks call phthiriasis[FZ].\r\nWhich arising from a bad habit of body, seldom stops there; but\r\ngenerally after some time there follows a smart flux of gum; and the\r\neyes themselves being greatly ulcerated, it even destroys the sight.\r\n\r\n  [FZ] φθειρίασις.\r\n\r\nSuch patients must be purged by clysters; the hair of their head\r\nclipped close to the skin, and the head rubbed for a long time\r\nevery day fasting. They must diligently practise walking, and other\r\nexercises; gargle with a decoction of catmint and a mellow fig in\r\nmulse; foment the head often in the bath with plenty of warm water;\r\navoid acrid food; use good milk and wine, and also drink more freely\r\nthan they eat. Medicines too are to be given internally, of a mild\r\nnature, that they may not generate any acrid gum; and others externally\r\napplied to kill the lice, and prevent the production of more. For this\r\npurpose, of aphronitre p. i. *. sandarach p. i. *. stavesacre p. i. *.\r\nare powdered together, and then equal quantities of old oil and vinegar\r\nare added, till the whole come to the consistence of honey.\r\n\r\nThus much of those distempers of the eyes, which are cured by mild\r\nmedicines. There are besides these, other kinds, which require a\r\ndifferent treatment, commonly proceeding from inflammations, but\r\ncontinuing even after they\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Collyrium of Andreas._]\r\n\r\nare gone. And in the first place, a flux of thin gum continues in\r\nsome. To such patients clysters should be given, and their quantity of\r\nfood diminished. Neither is it improper to anoint the forehead with\r\nthe composition of Andreas: which consists of gum p. i. *. ceruss,\r\nantimony, each p. ii. *. litharge boiled and washed p. iv. *. the\r\nlitharge is boiled in rain water; and the dry medicines are rubbed with\r\nthe juice of myrtle. These being spread upon the forehead, a cataplasm\r\nof meal is also to be applied over it, made into a paste with cold\r\nwater, and with the addition either of acacia juice or cypress. It is\r\nproper also to make an incision on the top of the head, and apply a\r\ncupping vessel there; or to bleed at the temples. The eye ought to be\r\nanointed with that composition, which contains of copper scales, poppy\r\ntears, each p. *. hartshorn calcined and washed, washed lead, gum, each\r\np. iv. *. frankincense p. xii. *. Now this collyrium, because horn is\r\none of the ingredients, is called diaceratos[GA]. As often as I do not\r\nsubjoin what kind of moisture is to be added, I would be understood to\r\nintend water.\r\n\r\n  [GA] διὰ κέρατος.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _The memigmenon of Euelpides._]\r\n\r\nFor the same purpose is that of Euelpides, which he called\r\nmemigmenon[GB]. In it there are poppy tears and white pepper, of\r\neach an ounce, gum a pound, calcined copper p. i. *. During this\r\ncourse, with some intervals, the bath and wine are serviceable. And as\r\nextenuating food must be avoided by all that labour under a lippitude;\r\nso particularly by those that have for a long time a flux of thin\r\nhumour. But if they be surfeited with such food as generates a thicker\r\nphlegm, as is most common in this kind of diet, they must have recourse\r\nto that, which because it binds the belly, constringes the body too.\r\n\r\n  [GB] μεμιγμένον.\r\n\r\nBut ulcers, that do not go off with the inflammation, generally either\r\ngrow fungous, or foul, or at least inveterate. Their excrescences are\r\nbest suppressed by the collyrium called memigmenon. The foul ones are\r\ndeterged both by the same, and by that, which is called smilion.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Smilion._]\r\n\r\nThis contains of verdigrease p. vi. *. gum the same quantity,\r\nammoniacum, minium from Sinope, each p. xvi. *. these are rubbed down\r\nby some with water, by others, to make them stronger, with vinegar.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Phynon of Euelpides._]\r\n\r\nThat of Euelpides, which he called phynon, is also suitable to this\r\ncase; of saffron p. i. *. poppy tears, gum, each p. ii. *. copper\r\ncalcined and washed, myrrh, each p. iv. *. white pepper p. vi. *. But\r\nthe application of this must be preceded by an ointment.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Sphærion of the same author._]\r\n\r\nThe collyrium of the same author, to which he gave the name of\r\nsphærion, is of like virtue; of bloodstone washed p. ii. *. pepper six\r\ngrains, cadmia washed, myrrh, poppy tears, each p. iii. *. saffron p.\r\niv. *. gum p. viii. *. which are rubbed down with Aminæan wine.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _A liquid medicine by the same._]\r\n\r\nHe likewise compounded a liquid medicine for the same purpose, in\r\nwhich were the following things; of verdigrease p. *. minium calcined,\r\ncopperas, cinnamon, each p. iii. *. saffron, nard, poppy tears, each p.\r\ni. *. myrrh p. ii. *. calcined copper p. iii. *. aromatick ashes p. iv.\r\n*. pepper fifteen grains. These are rubbed with a rough wine, and then\r\nboiled with three heminæ of passum, till the whole unites. And this\r\nmedicine becomes more efficacious by keeping.\r\n\r\nFor filling the cavities of ulcers _of the eyes_, the best of all those\r\nwe have mentioned are the sphærion and the collyrium of Philes. The\r\nsame sphærion is an excellent medicine for inveterate ulcers, and such\r\nas can scarcely be brought to cicatrize.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Hermon’s._]\r\n\r\nThere is also a collyrium, which though it be serviceable in many\r\ncases, yet seems to be most efficacious in these ulcers. It is said to\r\nbe invented by Hermon. It contains of long pepper p. i. *. z. *. white\r\npepper p. *. cinnamon, costus, each p. i. *. copperas, nard, cassia,\r\ncastor, each p. ii. *. galls p. v. *. myrrh, saffron, frankincense,\r\nlycium, ceruss, each p. viii. *. poppy tears p. xii. *. aloes, calcined\r\ncopper, cadmia, each p. xvi. *. acacia, antimony, gum, each p. xxv. *.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Asclepias._]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Canopite._]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Pyxinum of Euelpides._]\r\n\r\nCicatrices formed from ulcers are liable to two defects; of being\r\neither concave, or protuberant. If they be concave, they may be filled\r\nby the sphærion collyrium; or that called asclepias. This consists of\r\npoppy tears p. ii. *. sagapenum, opopanax, each p. iii. *. verdigrease\r\np. iv. *. gum p. viii. *. pepper p. xii. *. cadmia washed, ceruss, each\r\np. xvi. *. But if the cicatrices are thick, they are rendered thin\r\nby the smilion, or canopite collyrium, which last contains cinnamon,\r\nacacia, of each p. i. *. cadmia washed, saffron, myrrh, poppy tears,\r\ngum, each p. ii. *. white pepper, frankincense, each p. iii. *.\r\ncalcined copper p. ix. *. with rain water. Or the pyxinum of Euelpides,\r\nwhich consists of the following ingredients; of fossile salt p. iv.\r\n*. ammoniacum thymiama p. viii. *. poppy tears p. xiii. *. ceruss p.\r\nxv. *. white pepper, Cilician saffron, each p. lii. gum p. xiii. *.\r\ncadmia washed p. ix. *. Yet the composition, which contains gum p. iii.\r\n*. verdigrease p. i. *. crocomagma p. iv. *. seems to be the best for\r\nremoving a cicatrix.\r\n\r\nThere is also another kind of inflammation, in which if the patient’s\r\neyes swell, and are distended with pain, it is necessary to bleed in\r\nthe forehead; and to foment the head and eyes plentifully with hot\r\nwater; to gargle with lentils, or cream of figs; to anoint with the\r\nacrid medicines mentioned above; particularly that, which is called\r\nsphærion, and which has blood-stone in it. And others are useful too,\r\nwhich are calculated to lessen the roughness; of which I am going to\r\nspeak.\r\n\r\nThis commonly follows an inflammation of the eyes; sometimes it is\r\nmore violent, at other times more slight. Sometimes too a roughness\r\noccasions a lippitude, and that again increases the roughness, and in\r\nsome is short, in others it continues long, and so as to be hardly ever\r\ncured.\r\n\r\nIn this kind of disorder some scrape the thick and hard eye-lids\r\nboth with a fig-leaf and a specillum asperatum(6), and sometimes\r\nwith a knife; and turning them up, they rub them every day with\r\nmedicines. Which ought not to be practised, unless in a considerable\r\nand inveterate roughness, nor that often. For the same end is better\r\nobtained by a suitable regimen and proper medicines. Therefore we shall\r\nuse exercises and the bath more frequently: and foment the eye-lids\r\nwith plenty of warm water. The food must be acrid and extenuating.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Cæsarian._]\r\n\r\nThe medicine, which is called Cæsarian, contains of copperas p. i.\r\n*. misy p. *. white pepper p. v. *. poppy tears, gum, each p. ii. *.\r\ncadmia washed p. iii. *. antimony p. vi. *. And this collyrium is\r\nallowed to be a good remedy against every kind of disorder in the eyes,\r\nexcept those, that are treated by mild medicines.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Hierax’s._]\r\n\r\nThat also, which is called Hierax’s, is powerful against a roughness.\r\nIt consists of myrrh p. *. ammoniacum thymiama p. ii. *. rasile\r\nverdigrease p. iv. *. with rain water. For the same purpose that\r\nalso is proper, which is called canopite, and the smilion, and the\r\npyxinum, and the sphærion. But if compound medicines are not at hand, a\r\nroughness may be easily enough cured by goat’s gall or the best honey.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Dry lippitude._]\r\n\r\nThere is likewise a kind of dry lippitude, which the Greeks call\r\nxerophthalmia[GC]. In this the eyes neither swell, nor run, but are\r\nonly red, and heavy with some pain, which is commonly slight, also an\r\nitching, and the eye-lids without any hardness stick together in the\r\nnight-time by means of a very troublesome gum: and the less violent in\r\nits degree this species is, so much the longer does it continue.\r\n\r\n  [GC] ξηροφθαλμία.\r\n\r\nIn this disorder it is necessary to walk much, to take much exercise,\r\nto bathe often, and sweat in the bagnio, to use much friction. The\r\nproper diet is neither such as is filling, nor over acrid, but the\r\nmiddle kind betwixt these. In the morning, when it is evident that the\r\nconcoction is completed, it is not improper to gargle with mustard, and\r\nalter that to rub the head and face a considerable time.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Rhinion._]\r\n\r\nThe collyrium best adapted to this case is that called rhinion. Which\r\ncontains of myrrh p. i. *. poppy tears, acacia juice, pepper, gum, each\r\np. i. *. blood-stone, Phrygian stone, lycium, scissile stone, each p.\r\ni. *. calcined copper p. iv. *. The pyxinum also is suitable for the\r\nsame purpose.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Basilicon of Euelpides._]\r\n\r\nBut if the eyes be scabrous, which mostly happens in the angles, the\r\nrhinion mentioned already may be serviceable. For the same purpose\r\nthat may be useful, which contains, of rasile verdigrease, long pepper,\r\npoppy tears each p. ii. *. white pepper, gum, each p. iv. *. cadmia\r\nwashed, ceruss, each p. vi. *. However, there is none better than that\r\nof Euelpides, which he called basilicon. It contains of poppy tears,\r\nceruss, Asian stone, each p. ii. *. gum p. xiii. *. white pepper p. iv.\r\n*. saffron p. vi. *. psoricum(7) p. xiii. *. Now there is no simple,\r\nwhich by itself is called psoricum; but a certain quantity of chalcitis\r\nand a little more than half its quantity of cadmia are rubbed together\r\nwith vinegar; and this being put into an earthen vessel, and covered\r\nover with fig leaves, is deposited under ground for twenty days, and\r\nbeing taken up again it is powdered, and thus is called psoricum. The\r\nbasilicon collyrium too is generally allowed to be proper for all\r\ndisorders of the eyes, that are not treated by mild medicines.\r\n\r\nBut when compound medicines are not to be had, both honey and wine\r\nmitigates an asperity in the angles. These and a dry lippitude too are\r\nrelieved by an application of bread, softened with wine, over the eyes.\r\nFor since there is generally a humour, which exasperates sometimes the\r\neye itself, sometimes the angles, or eyelids; by this application, if\r\nany humour is discharged, it is drawn away, and if it happens to be\r\nlodged near, is repelled.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Of a dimness of the eyes._]\r\n\r\nA dimness comes upon the eyes, sometimes from a lippitude, at other\r\ntimes even without that, from old age, or weakness. If the disorder\r\nproceeds from the relics of a lippitude, the collyrium called asclepias\r\nis serviceable. Likewise that, which is composed of crocomagma.\r\n\r\nThe collyrium which is called diacrocou[GD] is composed peculiarly for\r\nthis. It contains of pepper p. i. *. Cilician saffron, poppy tears,\r\nceruss, each p. ii. *. psoricum, gum, each p. iv. *.\r\n\r\n  [GD] διὰ κρόκου.\r\n\r\nBut if it arises from old age, or weakness, it may be proper to anoint\r\nwith the best honey, and cyprine and old oil. But it is most expedient\r\nto mix together one part of balsam, and two of old, or cyprine oil,\r\nand three parts of the most pungent honey. The medicines prescribed\r\nabove for a dimness _from a lippitude_, and those mentioned before for\r\ndiminishing cicatrices, are useful in this case too.\r\n\r\nWhoever is troubled with a dimness must walk much, use exercise,\r\nfrequent bathing, at which time the whole body must be rubbed, but\r\nprincipally the head, with iris ointment till it sweat; after that it\r\nmust be veiled, and not uncovered, till after he has got home, and\r\nthe sweat and heat have ceased. Then he must keep to an acrid and\r\nextenuating diet; and after the interval of some days use a gargarism\r\nof mustard.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Of a cataract._]\r\n\r\nA suffusion also, which the Greeks call hypochysis[GE], sometimes\r\nobstructs the pupil of the eye, where vision is performed. If this\r\ndisorder be inveterate, it requires an operation to remove it. At the\r\nbeginning sometimes it is discussed by certain methods adapted to the\r\ncase. It is expedient to bleed in the forehead, or nose; to cauterize\r\nthe veins in the temples; by the use of gargarisms to evacuate phlegm;\r\nto use fumigations; to anoint the eyes with acrid medicines. The best\r\ndiet is such as extenuates phlegm.\r\n\r\n  [GE] ὑπόχυσις.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _A palsy of the eyes._]\r\n\r\nNor is a palsy of the eyes (which the Greeks call paralysis) to be\r\ncured by any different diet, or different medicines, so that it is\r\nneedless to do more than describe the distemper. It happens then\r\nsometimes in one eye, sometimes in both, either from a blow, or from\r\nan epilepsy, or spasms, where the eye itself is strongly convulsed, so\r\nthat it can neither be directed to any particular object, nor be kept\r\nfixed; but moves to and fro involuntarily; and therefore cannot see any\r\nthing distinctly.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Of a mydriasis._]\r\n\r\nWhat the Greeks call a mydriasis[GF] is not very different from this\r\ndistemper. The pupil is dilated, the sight grows dull, and almost dim.\r\nThis kind of weakness is extremely difficult to remove. Against both\r\ndisorders, that is, the palsy and mydriasis, we must use the same\r\nremedies as have been prescribed in the dimness of the eyes, with a few\r\nalterations; thus for the head, to the iris oil must be added sometimes\r\nvinegar, sometimes nitre; it is sufficient to anoint the eyes with\r\nhoney. In the latter disorder some have made use of hot waters(8),\r\nand been relieved; others without any apparent cause have suddenly lost\r\ntheir sight. Some of these, after continuing blind for some time, from\r\na sudden purging have recovered their sight: whence it seems the less\r\nimproper, both when the disorder is recent, and when it is of some\r\nstanding, to procure stools by medicines, in order to force all the\r\nnoxious matter into the lower parts.\r\n\r\n  [GF] μυδρίασις.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _A weakness of the eyes._]\r\n\r\nBesides these, there is a kind of weakness of the eyes, in which\r\npatients see well enough in the day-time, but not at all in the night:\r\nwhich never happens to a woman, when her menstrual discharge is\r\nregular. But persons labouring under this disorder ought to be anointed\r\nwith the blood of a liver (particularly the liver of a he-goat; if\r\nthat cannot be had, of a she-goat) that drops from it while roasting;\r\nand they ought to eat the liver itself. They may nevertheless not\r\nimproperly make use of the same medicines, that extenuate either\r\ncicatrices, or an asperity. Some powder the seed of purslane, and add\r\nhoney to it, till the mixture be of such a consistence, as not to\r\ndrop off a probe, and anoint with that. They must also use exercises,\r\nbathing, frictions.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Of external hurts in the eyes._]\r\n\r\nThese disorders all arise from internal causes. But externally the eye\r\nmay be hurt by a blow, so as to become bloodshot. There is nothing\r\nmore proper for this case than anointing with the blood of a pigeon,\r\nor ringdove, or swallow. Nor is this practice without reason; since\r\nthe sight of these birds being hurt by some accident, in a little time\r\nis restored, and that of the swallow soonest; which gave rise to the\r\nfable, that their parents perform by an herb the cure, which is really\r\nthe work of nature. Their blood therefore is a very proper remedy for\r\nour eyes in external hurts, in these different degrees of efficacy;\r\nthe blood of a swallow is best, next to that of a ringdove; that of a\r\npigeon is least medicinal both to itself and us.\r\n\r\nOver an eye that has received a blow, in order to assuage the\r\ninflammation, it is also proper to apply cataplasms. Now sal ammoniac,\r\nor any other, ought to be very finely powdered, oil being dropped in by\r\ndegrees, till it acquire the consistence of strigment. Then this is to\r\nbe mixed with barley-meal boiled in mulse. Upon a review of all the\r\ncures published, even by physicians, it is easy to see, that there is\r\nhardly one of the abovementioned disorders of the eyes, which may not\r\nbe sometimes removed by very simple and obvious remedies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. VII.\r\n\r\nOF THE DISEASES OF THE EARS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThus far we have recited those disorders of the eyes, in which\r\nmedicines are most efficacious; we must now proceed to the ears; the\r\npart, which nature has bestowed upon us next in usefulness to the eyes.\r\nBut in these the danger is much greater. For the mischief arising\r\nfrom the distempers of the eyes is confined to themselves; whereas\r\ninflammations and pains of the ears sometimes occasion madness and\r\ndeath: which makes it the more necessary to administer speedy relief in\r\ntheir beginnings, to prevent any greater danger.\r\n\r\nWherefore, when a person first feels a pain, he ought to fast, and\r\nobserve a strict regimen; the day following, if the disorder increases,\r\nto clip the hair of his head, and anoint it all over with ointment of\r\niris warm, and to cover it. But a violent pain attended with a fever,\r\nand watching, requires also bleeding. If particular circumstances\r\nprevent that, the body must be kept open. Hot cataplasms too,\r\nfrequently changed, are serviceable; either of the meal of fenugreek,\r\nor lint-seed, or any other, boiled in mulse. Spunges also squeezed out\r\nof hot water are proper to apply now and then. When the pain is eased,\r\ncerate made either of iris or cyprine oil ought to be put round it. In\r\nsome, however, that which is made of oil of roses, succeeds better. If\r\na violent inflammation prevents sleep entirely, to the cataplasm ought\r\nto be added half its quantity of poppy heads toasted and powdered; and\r\nthen these may be boiled together in passum, or mulse. It is proper too\r\nto infuse some medicine into the ear: which ought always to be made\r\ntepid first, and is most conveniently dropped in by a strigil(9).\r\nWhen the ear is filled, soft wool is to be put into it to keep the\r\nliquor from returning. And these are general remedies.\r\n\r\nNow the medicines _for injection_ are the juice of roses, and the\r\nroots of reeds, and oil, in which worms have been boiled, and the\r\nliquor of bitter almonds, or that, which is pressed from a peach\r\nkernel. The compositions for alleviating the inflammation and pain are\r\ngenerally these; of castor, poppy tears, equal quantities powdered,\r\nand afterwards mixed with passum. Or equal quantities of poppy\r\ntears, saffron, and myrrh are beat, rose oil and passum being added\r\nalternately. Or the bitter part of an Egyptian bean is powdered, and\r\nrose oil added to it: with which some also mix a little myrrh, or\r\npoppy tears, or frankincense with breast milk, or the juice of bitter\r\nalmonds with rose oil. Or castor, myrrh, and poppy tears in equal\r\nquantities, with passum. Or of saffron p. i. *. myrrh, scissile allum,\r\neach p. iii. *. and in powdering these, three cyathi of passum are to\r\nbe gradually mixed with them, and less than a cyathus of honey. This is\r\none of the principal remedies. Or poppy tears with vinegar. We may also\r\nuse Themison’s composition, which consists of castor, opopanax, poppy\r\ntears with vinegar, each p. ii. *. aphronitre p. iv. *. which being\r\npowdered are incorporated with passum, till they be of the consistence\r\nof cerate; and so laid by. When they are wanted for use, the medicine\r\nis again rubbed down by a pistil, with the addition of passum. This is\r\na constant rule, whenever a medicine is too thick for dropping into the\r\near, that liquor must be added, with which it ought to be compounded,\r\ntill it be sufficiently fluid.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Of pus in the ears._]\r\n\r\nBut if there is pus in the ears, it is proper to infuse lycium by\r\nitself; or ointment of iris; or juice of leek, with honey; or juice of\r\ncentory with passum; or juice of a pomegranate warmed in its own shell,\r\nwith the addition of a small proportion of myrrh. A proper mixture\r\nis also made of the myrrh called stacte p. i. *. the same quantity\r\nof saffron, twenty five bitter almonds, a cyathus and half of honey;\r\nwhich being rubbed together, are to be warmed in a pomegranate shell,\r\nwhen they are to be used. Those medicines, which are compounded for an\r\nulcerated mouth, are equally sanative to ulcers of the ears. If these\r\nbe of pretty long standing, and there is a great discharge of sanies,\r\nthe proper composition is that generally ascribed to Erasistratus. It\r\ncontains of pepper, saffron, each p. i. *. myrrh, misy calcined, each\r\np. ii. *. calcined copper p. ii. *. These are rubbed down with wine;\r\nwhen they are grown dry, three heminae of passum are added, and they\r\nare boiled together. When they are to be used, honey and wine are added\r\nto them. There is also a medicine of Ptolemaeus the surgeon; which\r\ncontains mastich, galls, of each p. i. *. omphacium p. i. *. juice of\r\nthe pomegranate. That of Menophilus is very efficacious, which consists\r\nof the following things; of long pepper p. i. *. castor p. ii. *.\r\nmyrrh, saffron, poppy tears, Syrian nard, frankincense, pomegranate\r\nbark, the inner part of an Egyptian bean, bitter almonds, the best\r\nhoney, each p. iv. *. When they are powdered, the sharpest vinegar is\r\nadded, till the whole be of the consistence of passum. There is also\r\na composition of Crato’s; of cinnamon, cassia, each p. i. *. nard,\r\nlycium, myrrh, each p. i. *. aloes p. ii. *. honey, three cyathi, wine\r\na sextarius. Of these the lycium is boiled with the wine; after that\r\nmixed with the other ingredients. But if the quantity of pus be great,\r\nand there is a bad smell; of rasile verdigrease, frankincense, each p.\r\nii. *. honey, two cyathi, of vinegar four, are boiled all together.\r\nWhen the composition is to be used, it is mixed with sweet wine.\r\nOr scissile allum, poppy tears, juice of acacia are mixed in equal\r\nquantities, and to these is added juice of henbane less than half the\r\nquantity of any of the other ingredients; and these being powdered are\r\ndiluted with wine. The juice of henbane too by itself is pretty good.\r\n\r\nAsclepiades compounded a general remedy against all disorders of the\r\nears, which is now approved by experience. In it there are of cinnamon,\r\ncassia, each p. i. *. flowers of round cyperus, castor, white pepper,\r\nand long, amomum, myrobalans, each two scruples, male frankincense,\r\nSyrian nard, fat myrrh, saffron, aphronitre, each p. ii. *. Which\r\nbeing powdered separately, and afterwards mixed, are rubbed down with\r\nvinegar; and being thus preserved are diluted with vinegar when used.\r\nIn the same manner, the sphragis of Polybus liquified with sweet wine,\r\nis a general remedy for disorders in the ears; which composition is\r\ncontained in the former book.\r\n\r\nBut if sanies is discharged, and there is a tumour, it is not improper\r\nto wash it with diluted wine by a syringe; and then to infuse rough\r\nwine mixed with oil of roses, and the addition of a little spodium, or\r\nlycium with milk, or the juice of the blood herb, with oil of roses, or\r\njuice of pomegranate with a very small proportion of myrrh.\r\n\r\nIf there are also foul ulcers, it is better to wash them with mulse;\r\nand after that, some one of the compositions mentioned above, that\r\ncontains honey, is infused. If the pus flows more plentifully, in\r\nthat case, the hair of the head is to be clipped close, and plenty of\r\nwarm water poured over it; also gargarisms must be used, and walking\r\nto lassitude, with a sparing diet. If blood likewise appears from the\r\nulcers, lycium with milk ought to be infused; or a decoction of roses\r\nin water; with the addition of the juice either of blood herb, or\r\nacacia.\r\n\r\nBut if a fungus has grown upon the ulcers, which is fetid, and\r\ndischarges blood, it ought to be washed with tepid water; and after\r\nthat, the composition infused, which is made of frankincense,\r\nverdigrease, vinegar, and honey; or honey boiled with verdigrease.\r\nCopper scales too with sandarach, powdered, is proper to be dropped in\r\nby a pipe.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Of worms in the ears._]\r\n\r\nWhen worms are generated there, if they be within reach, they must be\r\ndrawn out with a specillum oricularium(10), if farther in, they must\r\nbe killed by medicines; and means used to prevent the breeding of more.\r\nWhite hellebore powdered with vinegar, answers both these intentions.\r\nThe ear ought to be washed also with a decoction of horehound in wine.\r\nThus, the worms being killed slide down into the entrance of the ear,\r\nfrom whence they may be taken out with very great ease.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Obstructions in the ears._]\r\n\r\nIf the orifice of the ear be straitened, and a thick sanies is\r\ncontained within, the best honey ought to be put into it. If that does\r\nlittle good, to a cyathus and half of the best honey must be added of\r\nrasile verdigrease p. ii. *. which are to be boiled together, and made\r\nuse of. Iris also with honey is good for the same purpose. Likewise of\r\nhoney and oil of roses two scruples. Also of galbanum p. ii. *. myrrh\r\nwith honey, and ox-gall, each p. ii. *. wine a sufficient quantity to\r\ndilute the myrrh.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Dulness of hearing._]\r\n\r\nWhen a person grows dull of hearing, (which most commonly happens after\r\nlong pains of the head) in the first place, it is proper to inspect the\r\near itself. For there will appear either a crust, such as grows upon\r\nulcers, or a collection of the cerumen. If there is a crust, either\r\nwarm oil must be infused, or verdigrease with honey, or juice of leek,\r\nor a little nitre with mulse. And when this crust falls forward, it\r\nmust be washed with tepid water, that after it has fairly disengaged\r\nitself it may be the easier pulled out by the specillum oricularium.\r\nIf there be cerumen, and this is soft, it must be taken out with the\r\nsame instrument. But if it be hard, vinegar, and a little nitre with it\r\nmust be injected; and when it is softened, the ear should be washed in\r\nthe same manner, and cleansed. And if a heaviness of the head remain,\r\nthe hair must be clipped, and the head gently rubbed, but a long time,\r\nwith the oil of iris or laurel, and with either of these may be mixed\r\na little vinegar: then the patient must take a long walk, and after\r\nanointing, foment the head gently with warm water; and make use of\r\nfood of the weakest and middle class, and more especially take diluted\r\ndrinks; sometimes use gargarisms. Into the ear must be infused castor,\r\nwith vinegar and laurel oil, and the juice of radish rind, or the juice\r\nof wild cucumber, with the addition of rose leaves powdered. The juice\r\nalso of unripe grapes infused with oil of roses, is pretty good against\r\na deafness.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Of a noise in the ears._]\r\n\r\nThe disorder is of a different nature, where there is a noise within\r\nthe ears themselves: and this prevents them from receiving an external\r\nsound. This is slightest, when it proceeds from a gravedo; worse,\r\nwhen it is occasioned by a distemper or inveterate pains of the head;\r\nworst of all, when it is the harbinger of some violent disease, and\r\nparticularly of an epilepsy. If it happens from a gravedo, the ear\r\nought to be cleansed, and the patient hold in his breath, till some\r\nfrothy moisture issue from it. If, from a distemper, or pain of the\r\nhead, the same rules _as prescribed in a dulness of hearing_, must\r\nbe practised with regard to exercise, friction, pouring on of cold\r\nwater, and the use of gargarisms; no food but such as extenuates must\r\nbe used; juice of radish, with oil of roses, or with the juice of the\r\nroot of wild cucumber, must be infused into the ear, or castor with\r\nvinegar and laurel oil. Hellebore is also rubbed with vinegar, then\r\nincorporated with boiled honey, and being made into a collyrium, is\r\nintroduced into the ear. If it has begun without these, and therefore\r\ngives reason to fear the approach of some terrible disease, castor\r\nought to be infused into the ear with vinegar, or oil, either of iris\r\nor laurel; or together with the last, castor and the juice of bitter\r\nalmonds; or myrrh and nitre with oil of roses and vinegar. But a proper\r\ndiet is more serviceable in this case too. And the same rules are to\r\nbe observed, which I prescribed above, even with greater exactness;\r\nbesides which, the patient must refrain from wine, till the noise cease.\r\n\r\nBut if, at the same time, there are both a noise and an inflammation,\r\nit is sufficient to inject laurel oil, or that, which is expressed from\r\nbitter almonds; with which, some mix either castor or myrrh.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Of extraneous bodies in the ears._]\r\n\r\nIt sometimes happens too, that something falls into the ear, as a\r\nsmall stone, or some animal. If a flea has got into it, a little wool\r\nmust be pressed in; and if it comes upon that, it is drawn out along\r\nwith it. If it has not followed it, or it be any other animal, a probe\r\nwrapt in wool must be dipped in the most adhesive resin, particularly\r\nturpentine, and this is to be introduced into the ear, and turned round\r\nthere: for it will certainly catch hold of it, and bring it away. But\r\nif it be any lifeless thing, it must be drawn out by the specillum\r\noricularium, or a blunt hook, but little bent. If these means do not\r\nsucceed, it may be drawn out by resin, in the same manner as directed\r\nin the preceding case. Sternutatories also are very proper to force it\r\nout, or water strongly injected by a syringe. _The following method is\r\nalso practised in this case_; a board is laid down(11), supported in\r\nthe middle, with both ends hanging over, and the patient is tied upon\r\nthat, lying on that side, the ear of which is affected, so that he does\r\nnot reach over the board; then the end of the board, where his feet\r\nare, must be struck with a hammer, and thus by shaking the ear, what is\r\nwithin it drops out.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. VIII.\r\n\r\nOF THE DISEASES OF THE NOSE.\r\n\r\n\r\nUlcers in the nostrils must be fomented with the steam of hot water.\r\nThis is done both by applying a squeezed sponge, and putting under the\r\nnostrils a narrow-mouthed vessel filled with hot water. After this\r\nfomentation, the ulcers are to be anointed either with dross of lead,\r\nor ceruss, or litharge. When a person powders any of these, he may add,\r\nwhile they are rubbed, alternately, wine and myrtle oil, till he make\r\nit of the consistence of honey. But if these ulcers be near the mouth,\r\nand have several crusts, and a fetid smell, which kind the Greeks call\r\nozaena[GG], we may take it for granted, that it is hardly possible to\r\ncure that disease. Nevertheless, the following things may be tried;\r\nto clip the hair of the head close to the skin, and daily to rub it\r\nbriskly, and pour plenty of warm water over it; to walk much; to eat\r\nsparingly, and such food as is neither acrid nor of the strongest kind.\r\nThen to put into the nostril honey, with a very little turpentine resin\r\n(which is done by a probe, wrapt up in wool) and let this moisture\r\nbe drawn in by the breath, till the taste of it be perceived in the\r\nmouth. For by these means, the crusts are loosened, which ought then\r\nto be discharged by sneezing. The ulcers being thus cleansed must be\r\nfumigated with the vapour of hot water; afterwards should be applied,\r\neither lycium diluted with wine, or the lees of oil, or omphacium, or\r\njuice of mint, or of horehound; or copperas that has been burnt white,\r\nand then powdered; or the pulp of a squill bruised; to any of these\r\nhoney may be added, of which in the other mixtures there ought to be\r\nonly a very small part; with the copperas so much as to make it liquid;\r\nbut with the squill a considerable quantity; then the end of a probe\r\nmust be wrapped in wool, and dipped in the medicine; and by that the\r\nulcers are to be incarned. And further, a piece of lint is to be rolled\r\nup in an oblong form, and dipped in the same medicine, which is to be\r\nintroduced into the nostril, and loosely tied at the lower part. This\r\nought to be done twice a day, in the winter and spring, and thrice in\r\nthe summer and autumn.\r\n\r\n  [GG] ὄζαινα.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Of fleshy caruncles in the nostrils._]\r\n\r\nSometimes in the nostrils there grow caruncles resembling womens’\r\nnipples, and these adhere to its extremities, where it is\r\ncartilaginous. These ought to be treated with escharotic medicines;\r\nby which they are certainly consumed. A polypus[GH] is a caruncle\r\nsometimes white, sometimes inclining to a red colour, which sticks\r\nto the bones of the nostrils; and sometimes spreading towards the\r\nlips, it fills the nostril, at other times reaching backward through\r\nthe opening, by which the breath passes from the nose to the fauces,\r\nincreases so much, that it may be seen behind the uvula; and almost\r\nsuffocates the patient, especially when the south or east wind blows.\r\nIt is generally soft, seldom hard; and the latter obstructs the breath\r\nmore, dilates the nostrils, and is commonly of the cancerous nature,\r\nand therefore ought not to be touched. The other kind is generally\r\ncured by cutting; sometimes, however, it withers, if by means of lint\r\nor a pencillum, that composition be thrust up into the nose, which\r\ncontains of Sinopian minium, chalcitis, lime, sandarach, each p. i. *.\r\ncopperas p. ii. *.\r\n\r\n  [GH] πολύπους.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. IX.\r\n\r\nOF THE TOOTHACH.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the toothach, a disorder, that may justly be ranked even amongst\r\nthe greatest torments, the use of wine must be entirely forbid; and at\r\nfirst a total abstinence from food must be observed; afterwards it may\r\nbe taken sparingly, but soft, lest the teeth be irritated by chewing.\r\nThen externally, by means of a sponge, the steam of hot water is to be\r\napplied, and a cerate made of cyprine, or iris oil spread upon wool,\r\nand the head must also be covered. But if the pain be more severe, a\r\nclyster is useful, with hot cataplasms applied to the cheek, as also\r\nsome medicinal hot liquor held in the mouth, and frequently changed.\r\nFor which purpose is used a decoction of cinquefoil root in diluted\r\nwine; and henbane root, either in vinegar and water, or diluted wine,\r\nwith the addition of a little salt to either of them; and poppy heads\r\nnot over dry, and mandrake root prepared in the same manner. But in\r\nthese three, care must be taken not to swallow what is in the mouth.\r\nThe bark of the root of white poplar, boiled in diluted wine, does very\r\nwell for this purpose; or hartshorn shavings in vinegar, and catmint\r\nwith teda(12), and a mellow fig; also a mellow fig, either in mulse\r\nor in vinegar and honey, and when the fig is dissolved by boiling,\r\nthe liquor is strained. A probe also wrapt up in wool is dipped into\r\nhot oil; and used to touch the tooth itself. Moreover, something like\r\ncataplasms are put into the tooth. For which end the inner part of\r\nthe shell of an acid and dry pomegranate is powdered, with an equal\r\nquantity of galls and pine bark, and with these is mixed minium;\r\nwhich being powdered, are brought to a consistence with rain water;\r\nor panaces, poppy tears, hog’s fennel, stavesacre without its seeds,\r\npowdered in equal proportions; or three parts of galbanum, and a fourth\r\nof poppy tears. Whatever is applied to the teeth, a cerate, such as\r\nis directed above, ought, nevertheless, to be kept upon the cheek,\r\nand covered with wool. Some also bruise and spread upon linen, myrrh,\r\ncardamoms, of each p. i. *. saffron, pellitory, figs, pepper, each p.\r\niv. *. mustard p. viii. *. and apply this to the arm of that side,\r\nwhere the painful tooth is; if it be in the upper jaw, in the part\r\nnext the scapula; if in the lower, on that next the breast; and this\r\nrelieves the pain; and when it has given ease, it must be immediately\r\ntaken away.\r\n\r\nNow if the tooth be spoilt, we need not be hasty in extracting it,\r\nunless there be a necessity for it; but in such a case, to all the\r\nfomentations directed before, must be added some stronger compositions\r\nto ease the pain. Such as is that, which contains of poppy tears p.\r\ni. *. pepper p. ii. *. sory(13) p. x. *. these are powdered and\r\nmixed up with galbanum, and put round the affected tooth; or that of\r\nMenemachus principally for double teeth, in which are of saffron p. i.\r\n*. cardamoms, soot of frankincense, figs, pepper, pellitory, each p.\r\niv. *. mustard p. viii. *. Some mix of pellitory, pepper, elaterium,\r\neach p. i. *. scissile allum, poppy tears, stavesacre, crude sulphur,\r\nbitumen, bay-berries, mustard, of each p. ii. *. But if the pain make\r\nit necessary to take it out, a pepper corn stript of its bark, and in\r\nthe same manner an ivy berry put into its opening, splits the tooth,\r\nso that it comes away in scales. The prickle of the planus fish also\r\n(which we call pastinaca, the Greeks trygon) is toasted, then powdered,\r\nand mixed with resin, which being put round the tooth loosens it.\r\nScissile alum likewise put into the opening disposes the tooth to\r\ncome away. But it is more expedient to wrap this in a little wool,\r\nand then put it in: because in that way it both preserves the tooth,\r\nand eases the pain. These are the prescriptions of physicians; but\r\nthe experience of our peasants has discovered, that for the toothach\r\nthe herb horsemint ought to be pulled up by the roots, and put into a\r\nbason, and water infused upon it, and that the patient should sit down\r\nclose by it, covered all over with clothes; and then red hot flints are\r\nto be thrown into the bason, so as to be covered with the water, and\r\nthe patient with his mouth open must receive the vapour, close wrapt up\r\nas before directed. For both a plentiful sweat follows, and a continued\r\nstream of rheum runs from the mouth, which secures health for a pretty\r\nlong time, and frequently for a whole year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. X.\r\n\r\nOF THE DISEASES OF THE TONSILS.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf the tonsils swell from an inflammation without an ulcer, the\r\nhead must be covered as in the last disorder, and the part fomented\r\nexternally with the vapour of hot water; the patient must walk much;\r\nlie in bed with his head raised; and use gargarisms of the repellent\r\nmedicines. The liquorice root too bruised, and boiled in passum or\r\nmulse, has the same effect. And it is not amiss to touch them gently\r\nwith some medicines, which are made in this manner: the juice is\r\nsqueezed from a sweet pomegranate, and a sextarius of this is boiled\r\nover a gentle fire to the consistence of honey; then saffron, myrrh,\r\nscissile alum, of each p. ii. *. are powdered separately, and to these\r\nare added gradually two cyathi of mild wine, of honey one; after that,\r\nthey are mixed with the first mentioned juice; and again gently boiled;\r\nor a sextarius of the same juice is boiled in the same way, and the\r\nfollowing things powdered in like manner are added to it; of nard p.\r\n*. omphacium p. i. *. cinnamon, myrrh, cassia, each p. i. *. And these\r\nsame compositions are proper both for purulent ears and nostrils. The\r\nfood in this disorder also ought to be mild, lest it exasperate the\r\ninflammation.\r\n\r\nBut if the inflammation is so great as to obstruct the breath, the\r\npatient must rest in bed, abstain from eating, and take nothing else\r\nbut warm water: a clyster must also be given, and a gargarism used\r\nof figs and mulse; and the part touched with honey and omphacium.\r\nExternally the hot vapour must be applied, but for a longer time, till\r\nthey suppurate and break of themselves. If pus is contained within, and\r\nthe tumours do not break, they must be cut. Afterwards the patient must\r\ngargle with warm mulse.\r\n\r\nBut if with an inconsiderable swelling there is an ulceration, for a\r\ngargarism there must be added to the cream of bran a little honey,\r\nand the ulcers are to be anointed with the following medicines: three\r\ncyathi of the sweetest passum are boiled into one; then is added of\r\nfrankincense p. i. *. saffron, myrrh, each p. *. and the whole is set\r\nupon the fire again, till it boil. When the ulcers are clean, he must\r\ngargle with the same cream of bran, or with milk. And in this case also\r\na mild diet is necessary; to which may be added sweet wine.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. XI.\r\n\r\nOF ULCERS OF THE MOUTH.\r\n\r\n\r\nUlcers of the mouth, if they be attended with an inflammation, and\r\nare foul and red, are best treated by the medicines prepared from\r\npomegranates mentioned before. And a repellent cream, with the addition\r\nof a little honey, is to be held in the mouth often; the patient must\r\nwalk, and avoid all acrid food. When the ulcers begin to be clean,\r\na mild liquor, and sometimes the best water is to be kept in the\r\nmouth: and the use of wine undiluted does service, also a fuller diet,\r\nprovided it be not at all acrid. The ulcers ought to be sprinkled with\r\nscissile allum, and a little more than half its quantity of unripe\r\ngalls.\r\n\r\nIf they are already covered with crusts, such as we find in burns, the\r\ncompositions which the Greeks call antherae[GI] are to be applied.\r\nThese contain of long cyperus, myrrh, sandarach, allum, equal parts;\r\nor, of saffron, myrrh, each p. ii. *. iris, scissile allum, sandarach,\r\neach p. iv. *. long cyperus p. viii. *. Or, of galls, myrrh, each\r\np. ii. *. scissile allum p. ii. *. rose leaves, p. iv. *. But some\r\nmix together of saffron p. *. scissile allum, myrrh, each p. i. *.\r\nsandarach p. ii. *. long cyperus p. iv. *. The former are sprinkled on\r\ndry; the last is applied with honey; and not only to these ulcers, but\r\nto the tonsils also.\r\n\r\n  [GI] ἀθηραὶι.\r\n\r\nBut those ulcers, which the Greek call aphthae, are by far the most\r\ndangerous; that is, in children; for they often kill them: in men\r\nand women there is not the same danger. They begin at the gums, next\r\npossess the palate, and the whole mouth; then descend to the uvula\r\nand fauces. When these are affected, it is not easy for the child\r\nto recover. And the case is more deplorable, if the infant is yet\r\nsucking; because it is more difficult to apply any remedy. But in the\r\nfirst place the nurse must be obliged to exercise by walking and such\r\nemployments as move the superior parts; she must be sent to the bath,\r\nand ordered to pour warm water there over her breasts; next, her food\r\nmust be mild, and such as is not easily corrupted; and if the child\r\nhave a fever, she must drink water; if not, diluted wine. And if the\r\nnurse is costive, she must have a clyster; if phlegm collects in her\r\nmouth, a vomit. Then _for the infant_, the ulcers must be anointed\r\nwith honey, to which is added that kind of rhus(14), which is called\r\nSyrian, or bitter almonds; or with a mixture of dry rose leaves, pine\r\nkernels, and mint incorporated with honey; or that medicine may be\r\nused, which is made up with mulberries; the juice of which is boiled in\r\nthe same manner as that of the pomegranate to the consistence of honey;\r\nand in the same way, saffron, myrrh, allum, wine and honey are mixed\r\nwith it. Nor is any thing to be given, which may provoke the discharge\r\nof humour. If the child is come to more strength, he ought to gargle\r\nwith such mixtures, as have been mentioned before. And if the milder\r\nmedicines do but little service here, such are to be used, as by their\r\ncaustic quality may cover the ulcers with crusts. The scissile allum is\r\npowerful, or chalcitis, or copperas. Fasting too, in as great a degree\r\nas the patient can bear, does service. The food ought to be mild;\r\nhowever to cleanse the ulcers, it is proper to give sometimes cheese\r\nspread with honey.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. XII.\r\n\r\nOF ULCERS OF THE TONGUE.\r\n\r\n\r\nUlcers of the tongue require no other medicines than those, that have\r\nbeen laid down in the former part of the last chapter. But such as\r\narise upon the side of it continue longest. And it is necessary to\r\ninspect whether some tooth opposite to it is not too sharp, which often\r\nprevents an ulcer in that part from healing, and for that reason must\r\nbe filed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. XIII.\r\n\r\nOF PARULIDES AND ULCERS IN THE GUMS.\r\n\r\n\r\nSome painful tubercles also grow sometimes in the gums, near the teeth;\r\nthe Greeks call them parulides[GJ]. It is proper at the beginning, to\r\nrub these gently with powdered salt, or with a mixture of fossile salt\r\ncalcined, and cypress and catmint; then to wash the mouth with the\r\ncream of lentils, withal holding the mouth open, till the phlegm is\r\nsufficiently discharged. In a greater inflammation the same medicines\r\nare to be used, as were directed before, for ulcers of the mouth; and\r\na little soft lint is to be rolled up in one of those compositions,\r\nwhich I said were called antherae, and that must be put betwixt the\r\ntooth and the gum. But if the tumour be too hard to admit of that, the\r\nsteam of hot water, by means of a spunge, must be used externally,\r\nand cerate applied. If a suppuration appears, the steam must be used\r\nlonger; and a hot decoction of figs in mulse, must also be held in\r\nthe mouth. And the tubercle must be cut before it be quite ripe, lest\r\nthe pus, by continuing there too long hurt the bone. If the tumour be\r\npretty large, it is better to cut it out entirely, so that the tooth\r\nmay be freed on both sides. When the pus is discharged, if the wound be\r\nslight, it is sufficient to hold warm water in the mouth, and to foment\r\nexternally with the same vapour; if it be larger, to make use of the\r\ncream of lentils, and the same medicines, by which other ulcers in the\r\nmouth are cured.\r\n\r\n  [GJ] παρουλίδες.\r\n\r\nOther ulcers, likewise, frequently arise in the gums, which are\r\nrelieved in the same manner, as those in the other parts of the mouth.\r\nHowever, it is highly proper to chew privet, and hold the juice of it\r\nin the mouth. It sometimes happens, too, that from an ulcer in the gum,\r\nwhether it be a parulis or not, pus is discharged for a long time, when\r\na tooth is either rotten, or broke, or the bone otherwise spoilt; and\r\nthat commonly proceeds from a fistula. When this is the case, the part\r\nmust be opened, and the tooth extracted; if there be any exfoliation,\r\nit must be taken out; if any part of it is spoilt, it must be scraped.\r\nAfter which, the same methods must be taken, as were prescribed before\r\nin the cure of other ulcers. But if the gums leave the teeth, the same\r\nantherae are helpful. It does good also to chew pears or apples not\r\nvery ripe, and to keep their juice in the mouth. And mild vinegar held\r\nin the mouth may have the same effect.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. XIV.\r\n\r\nOF AN INFLAMMATION OF THE UVULA.\r\n\r\n\r\nA violent inflammation of the uvula may justly excite our fears.\r\nTherefore, in this case, abstinence is necessary, and it is proper\r\nto bleed; and if there is any good reason against that, a clyster is\r\nserviceable. Besides, the head must be covered, and kept pretty high;\r\nnext, a decoction of bramble and lentils in water, must be used as a\r\ngargarism; and the uvula itself be touched with honey, mixed either\r\nwith omphacium, or galls, or scissile allum. The medicine also, which\r\nis called andronium is suitable to this case. It consists of scissile\r\nallum, scales of red copper, copperas, galls, myrrh, and misy; which\r\nare powdered separately, and being mixed, they are again rubbed with\r\nthe addition of rough wine, to the consistence of honey. It does great\r\nservice also to apply to the uvula the juice of celandine, by means\r\nof a spoon. When the uvula is moistened with any of these, a great\r\nquantity of phlegm runs out; and when that ceases, the patient must\r\ngargle with hot wine.\r\n\r\nBut if the inflammation be slight, it is sufficient to powder laser,\r\nand add to it cold water, and to put this water into a spoon, and\r\nhold it below the uvula. And when it is not much swelled, cold water\r\nalone, used in the same way, constringes it. The patient must also\r\nuse a gargarism of water, either with laser, or without it. But the\r\nchirurgical cure for a lengthened uvula I shall describe afterwards.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. XV.\r\n\r\nOF A GANGRENE OF THE MOUTH.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf a gangrene seizes ulcers of the mouth, it is to be considered in the\r\nfirst place, whether the body be in a bad habit: if it be, that must\r\nbe rectified; and then we may proceed to the cure of the ulcers. But\r\nif that disorder be on the surface, it does well enough to sprinkle\r\na dry anthera upon the ulcer, if moist: if it be somewhat dry, it\r\nmust be laid on with a small portion of honey: if a little deeper,\r\ntwo parts of burnt paper, and one of orpiment: if the disorder is of\r\na considerable depth, three parts of burnt paper, and a fourth of\r\norpiment, or equal parts of salt and iris both toasted; or equal parts\r\nof chalcitis, lime, and orpiment. But it is necessary to dip lint in\r\nrose oil, and apply over that escharotic medicines, to prevent their\r\nhurting the sound contiguous part. Some also throw in so much toasted\r\nsalt into a hemina of strong vinegar, till it will dissolve no more;\r\nnext, they boil away this vinegar till the remainder be dry; and powder\r\nthe salt, and sprinkle it on the ulcers. Now, as often as a medicine is\r\napplied, both before and after, the mouth must be washed, either with\r\ncream of lentils, or a decoction of vetches, or olives, or vervains in\r\nwater; and with any of these must be mixed a little honey. Vinegar of\r\nsquills, also held in the mouth, has no small efficacy against these\r\nulcers; and vinegar mixed again with the salt, boiled in vinegar, as\r\nbefore directed. But when either of these is used, it must be kept in\r\nthe mouth a long time together, and be repeated twice or thrice in a\r\nday, as the malady is more or less severe. And if the patient be a\r\nchild, a probe must be wrapped in wool, and dipped into a medicine, and\r\nheld upon the ulcer; lest for want of thought, he should swallow the\r\nescharotics. But if there be a pain in the gums, and some of the teeth\r\nbe loosened, they ought to be pulled out: for they very much obstruct\r\nthe cure. If medicines do no service, the ulcers will require to be\r\ncauterized: which, however, is not necessary in the lips, because it is\r\nmore convenient to cut them out. And both that which is cauterized, and\r\nthat which is cut out, are equally incapable of being filled up without\r\nthe manual operation. Now the bones of the gums, which have but little\r\nlife in them, when once stripped by burning, continue bare ever after:\r\nfor the flesh never grows again there. Upon the burnt places, however,\r\nlentils must be applied, till they recover their soundness, as far as\r\nthe case will admit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. XVI.\r\n\r\nOF PAROTID SWELLINGS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThese are the disorders in the head, which generally require the help\r\nof medicines, but under the ears, it is common for parotides[GK] to\r\narise; sometimes in health, when an inflammation commences there;\r\nsometimes after long fevers, when the violence of the disease settles\r\nin that part. This is a kind of abscess: and therefore requires no\r\npeculiar method of cure. This one caution, however, is necessary, that\r\nif the swelling came without any preceding distemper, repellents should\r\nfirst of all be tried: if the disorder proceeds from any illness, that\r\nmethod is hurtful; and it is more expedient to have it maturated and\r\nopened as soon as possible.\r\n\r\n  [GK] παρωτίδες.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. XVII.\r\n\r\nOF A PROMINENT NAVEL.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the case of a prominent navel, to prevent the necessity of any\r\nchirurgical operation, trial must first be made of abstinence, and a\r\nclyster must be given; over the navel may be applied that composition,\r\nwhich consists of hemlock and soot, each p. i. *. ceruss washed, p. iv.\r\n*. lead washed p. viii. *. with two eggs; to which is likewise added\r\nthe juice of night-shade. This ought to lie on for a pretty long time;\r\nand, in the mean while, the patient is to be restrained from motion,\r\nuse a spare diet, and avoid every thing flatulent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. XVIII.\r\n\r\nOF THE DISEASES OF THE PRIVATE PARTS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe next disorders we are to treat of, are those of the private parts.\r\nThe names of which amongst the Greeks are both more tolerable, and\r\nalready established by custom; since they are of common use in almost\r\nevery book and discourse of physicians: with us the terms are more\r\nindecent, and have had no sanction from the conversation of modest\r\nmen to qualify their coarseness. This makes it difficult to treat of\r\nthem so, as at once to preserve a delicacy of expression, and deliver\r\nplainly the precepts of the art. Nevertheless this circumstance ought\r\nnot to deter me from writing. In the first place, because it is my\r\nintention to comprehend every thing, that I have learned to be useful;\r\nin the next place, because every body should know how to cure those\r\ndisorders, which we are so unwilling to expose to another.\r\n\r\nTherefore, if the penis be swelled from an inflammation, and the\r\nprepuce cannot either be drawn back, or brought forward again, the\r\npart must be fomented plentifully with warm water. And when the glans\r\nis covered, warm water must also be injected by a syringe, betwixt it\r\nand the skin. If the skin, mollified and extenuated by this means, can\r\nbe drawn back, the subsequent part of the cure is more easy; if the\r\nswelling prevails _against this remedy_, lentils, or horehound, or\r\nolive leaves boiled in wine must be applied, and to any of these, while\r\nit is rubbed, a little honey is added; and the penis is to be tied up\r\nto the belly; which is necessary in the cure of all its disorders; and\r\nthe patient ought to confine himself to a strict regimen, and abstain\r\nfrom eating, and relieve his thirst by nothing but water. The day\r\nfollowing, the fomentation of water must be applied in the same way,\r\nand trial made, even with some degree of violence, to pull back the\r\nprepuce; if it will not give way, the surface of it must be slightly\r\ncut with a knife. For when the sanies is discharged, the part will be\r\nextenuated, and the prepuce more easily drawn back.\r\n\r\nWhether it has yielded to the latter method, or has never resisted,\r\nulcers will be found, either in the inner part(15) of the prepuce, or\r\nin the glans, or in the penis beyond that; which must, of necessity,\r\nbe either clean and dry, or humid and purulent. If they be dry, they\r\nmust be first fomented with hot water; then lycium, with wine applied,\r\nor oil lees boiled with the same, or rose oil with butter. If there is\r\na thin humour in them, they must be washed with wine; then a little\r\nhoney and oil of roses with butter, and a fourth part of turpentine\r\nresin must be used. But if pus is discharged from them, first of all\r\nthey ought to be washed with warm mulse; after which is applied of\r\npepper p. i. *. myrrh p. ii. *. saffron, calcined milsy, each p. ii.\r\n*. which are boiled with a rough wine, to the consistence of honey.\r\nThe same composition is also proper for the tonsils, a moist uvula,\r\nand ulcers of the nostrils and mouth. Another for the same purpose: of\r\npepper p. i. *. myrrh p. i. *. saffron p. ii *. milsy p. i. *. calcined\r\ncopper p. ii. *. which are first rubbed down with a rough wine, then\r\nwhen they have grown dry, they are again rubbed with three cyathi of\r\npassum, and boiled to the consistence of viscum. Verdigrease too, with\r\nboiled honey, and those compositions, which were mentioned before, for\r\nulcers of the mouth, cure these. But the composition of Erasistratus,\r\nor Crato, is a proper application for purulent ulcers of the parts of\r\ngeneration. Olive leaves also are boiled in nine cyathi of wine(16),\r\nand to these are added of scissile allum p. iv. *. lycium p. viii. *.\r\nhoney a cyathus and half; and if the quantity of pus be pretty great,\r\nthis medicine is diluted with honey; if small, with wine. This is a\r\nconstant rule; after dressing, while the inflammation continues, to\r\napply over it such a cataplasm, as before directed, and to dress the\r\nulcers every day in the same manner. But if pus begins to be discharged\r\nin a great quantity, and is fetid, the _ulcer_ ought to be washed with\r\ncream of lentils, with the addition of a little honey, or a decoction\r\nof olive, or mastich leaves; or a decoction of horehound used in the\r\nlike manner with honey. And the same dressings must be applied; or else\r\nomphacium with honey; or that composition for the ears, which is made\r\nof verdigrease and honey; or the composition of Andron; or an anthera,\r\nwith the addition of a little honey. Some dress all the ulcers, which\r\nwe have yet mentioned, with lycium and wine.\r\n\r\nIf the ulcer increases in breadth and deepness, it ought to be washed\r\nin the same manner; and either verdigrease, or omphacium with honey,\r\napplied; or Andron’s composition; or of horehound, myrrh, saffron,\r\nscissile alum calcined, dry rose leaves, galls, each p. i. *. Sinopian\r\nminium, p. ii. *. which are first powdered separately; then mixed and\r\nrubbed together in honey, till they acquire the consistence of liquid\r\ncerate; after which they are boiled in a copper vessel, gently, so as\r\nnot to boil over; when the drops of it grow hard, the vessel is taken\r\noff the fire; and this medicine, as occasion requires, is softened,\r\neither with honey or wine. The same composition, by itself, is also\r\ngood for fistulas.\r\n\r\nSometimes too, the ulcer penetrates to the nerves; and there is a\r\nplentiful discharge of humour, and thin sanies and fetid, of no\r\nconsistence, but like water, in which recent flesh has been washed;\r\nthere are pains and prickings in the parts. Although this be of the\r\npurulent kind, yet it must be cured by mild medicines; such as the\r\ntetrapharmacum plaister, liquified with rose oil, and mixed with a\r\nlittle frankincense; or that, which is made of butter, rose oil, resin,\r\nand honey, already mentioned. Above all, this ulcer is to be fomented\r\nwith abundance of warm water, and covered, and not exposed to the cold.\r\n\r\nSometimes also, by these ulcers, the penis under the skin is so\r\nconsumed, that the glans falls off. In which case, the prepuce itself\r\nmust be taken off by circumcision. And it is a general rule, whenever\r\nthe glans, or any part of the penis falls off, or is cut off, that the\r\nskin be kept from falling in contact and uniting with the ulcer(17),\r\nso that it cannot be drawn back afterwards, and perhaps may even\r\nobstruct the urinary passage.\r\n\r\nTubercles likewise, which the Greeks call phymata, arise about the\r\nglans; which are cauterized either by medicines, or the actual cautery;\r\nand when the sloughs cast off, copper scales are sprinkled upon them,\r\nto prevent any thing growing there again.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Of a gangrene._]\r\n\r\nIn what we have hitherto described there is still no gangrene; to\r\nwhich, as in the other parts, so more especially here, ulcers are\r\nliable. It begins with a blackness. If this seizes the prepuce, a\r\nprobe must be immediately put under it, and an incision made; then the\r\nextremities are to be laid hold of with a vulsella(18), and whatever\r\nis corrupted must be cut away, and even some of the sound part taken\r\noff, and the place cauterized. Whenever any part is burned, the next\r\nstep is to apply lentils; afterwards, when the sloughs have cast off,\r\nthe cure is the same with that of common ulcers.\r\n\r\nBut if a gangrene has seized the penis itself, some of the escharotic\r\nmedicines must be sprinkled upon it, chiefly that, which is composed\r\nof lime, chalcitis, and orpiment. If medicines fail of success, here\r\nalso whatever is corrupted is to be cut out with a knife, in such a\r\nmanner as that some of the sound part be taken with it. This rule is as\r\nuniversal as the former, when a gangrened part is cut away, that the\r\nwound must be cauterized. But if either by means of medicines, or the\r\nactual cautery, the sloughs have grown callous, there is great danger,\r\nthat when they cast off, a profusion of blood from the penis may\r\nfollow. Therefore long rest is necessary, and keeping the body almost\r\nimmoveable, till the sloughs be gently loosened from it in proper time.\r\nBut if a person either wittingly, or inadvertently, by walking too soon\r\nhas separated the sloughs, and there ensues a hæmorrhage, cold water\r\nmust be applied. If that does not prevail, recourse must be had to\r\nthose medicines, which stop blood. If even these do not relieve, the\r\npart must be cauterized carefully and cautiously; and not afterwards\r\nexposed to the same danger by any motion whatsoever.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Of a phagedaena._]\r\n\r\nSometimes also in the same place there happens that kind of gangrene,\r\nwhich the Greeks call phagedæna[GL]. In which no time is to be lost,\r\nbut the same remedies must be immediately applied; and if these are not\r\nsuccessful, it must be burnt by the actual cautery. There is likewise\r\na certain blackness, which gives no pain, but spreads, and if we do\r\nnot resist it, it makes its way to the bladder; and cannot be cured\r\nafterwards. But if it be at the end of the glans near the urinary pipe,\r\na small probe should be introduced into that first, to prevent its\r\nclosing; and then the actual cautery must be applied to the ulcer. But\r\nif it has penetrated deep, whatever is tainted must be cut off. For the\r\nrest, it must have the same treatment with other gangrenes.\r\n\r\n  [GL] φαγέδαινα.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _A callosity or carbuncle._]\r\n\r\nThere is likewise sometimes a callous excrescence from the penis, which\r\nis almost void of all sensation, and ought to be cut out. A carbuncle,\r\nas soon as it appears there, must be washed by means of a syringe; then\r\nit must be cauterized too with medicines, particularly chalcitis with\r\nhoney, or verdigrease with boiled honey, or sheep’s dung toasted and\r\npowdered with honey. When it falls off, liquid medicines must be used,\r\nwhich are composed for the lips of ulcers.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Diseases of the testicles._]\r\n\r\nIf any inflammation begins in the testicles without a blow, blood must\r\nbe taken from the ancle; the patient must abstain from eating; that\r\ncomposition must be applied, which consists of bean meal boiled in\r\nmulse, then mixed with powdered cummin, and worked up to a consistence\r\nwith honey; or powdered cummin with cerate made of rose oil; or\r\nlintseed toasted, powdered, and boiled in mulse; or wheat meal boiled\r\nin mulse with cypress; or lily root bruised. But if the testicles are\r\ngrown hard, lint or fenugreek seed, boiled in mulse, should be applied;\r\nor cerate made of cyprine oil; or fine flour rubbed with wine and the\r\naddition of a little saffron. If the hardness be already of pretty long\r\nstanding, the root of wild cucumber boiled in mulse and then bruised\r\ndoes a great deal of service.\r\n\r\nIf they are swelled from a blow, it is necessary to let blood, and more\r\nso if they are livid besides; and either of these compositions made\r\nwith cummin above mentioned must be applied; or that composition, which\r\ncontains of nitre calcined p. i. *. pine resin, cummin, each p. ii. *.\r\nstavesacre without the seeds p. iv. *. honey, a sufficient quantity\r\nto bring them to a consistence. But if from the blow the testicle\r\nceases to receive nourishment, there is generally a collection of pus\r\nat the same time, and there is no other remedy for it, than by making\r\nan incision in the scrotum, to discharge the pus, and extirpate the\r\ntesticle itself.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Diseases of the anus. Rhagadia._]\r\n\r\nThe anus too is liable to many and very tedious disorders; and these\r\nare cured by methods not very different from one another. In the first\r\nplace it is a common ailment here, that the skin is chopped, and that\r\nin several places: the Greeks call it rhagadia[GM]. When this is\r\nrecent, the patient ought to rest, and sit down in hot water. Pigeons\r\neggs are also to be boiled, and when they are hard, the shells taken\r\noff, after that one of them ought to lie in water well heated, while\r\nthe part is fomented with the other warm; and thus each of them must be\r\nused alternately for some time. Then the tetrapharmacum or the rhypodes\r\nmust be softened with rose oil; or recent œsypum mixed with liquid\r\ncerate made of rose oil; or to the same liquid cerate must be added\r\nwashed lead; or myrrh to turpentine resin; or old oil to litharge: and\r\nthe part anointed with any of these. If the part affected be external,\r\nand not concealed within, a piece of lint dipped in the same medicine\r\nought to be applied to it, and whatever is laid first on, must be\r\ncovered with cerate. In this case neither acrid food, nor austere, nor\r\nbinding must be used; nothing even dried is good, unless the quantity\r\nbe very small. Liquid, mild, fat and glutinous food is better. There is\r\nno reason to refrain from the use of mild wine.\r\n\r\n  [GM] ῥαγάδια.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Of condylomata._]\r\n\r\nA condyloma is a tubercle, which commonly proceeds from some\r\ninflammation. When it appears, the directions must be observed, which\r\nwere just now given, with regard to rest, meat, and drink. It is\r\nproper to foment this tubercle with eggs, as in the other case. But\r\nthe patient should first sit down in a decoction of repellent vervains\r\nin water; then it is fit to apply lentils with a small proportion of\r\nhoney, mellilot boiled with wine, and bramble leaves bruised with\r\ncerate made of rose oil; and with the same cerate either a quince\r\nbruised, or the inner part of pomegranate bark boiled in wine; and\r\nchalcitis burnt, and powdered, then mixed with œsypum and rose oil;\r\nand some of that composition, which contains of frankincense p. i. *.\r\nscissile alum p. ii. *. ceruss p. iii. *. litharge p. v. *. to these,\r\nwhile they are powdered, is instilled alternately oil of roses and\r\nwine. The bandage for that part is a square piece of linen or woollen\r\ncloth, which at two of its corners has two loops, and at the other as\r\nmany fillets; and when it is put under the patient, the loops being\r\nturned toward the belly, the two fillets from behind are put through\r\nthem, and when drawn tight, the right one must be extended to the left,\r\nand that on the left to the right, and lastly both being brought round\r\nare tied in a knot over the belly. But if the condyloma be inveterate,\r\nand is grown hard, and does not give way to these methods, it may be\r\ncauterized by a medicine, which consists of the following ingredients;\r\nof verdigrease p. ii. *. myrrh p. iv. *. gum p. viii. *. frankincense\r\np. xii. *. antimony, poppy tears, acacia, each p. xvi. *. with which\r\nmedicine some chuse to renew those ulcers of which I was lately\r\ntreating. If this has no effect upon the condyloma, even stronger\r\ncaustics may be used. When the tumour is consumed, we must change to\r\nthe mild applications.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Of the hemorrhoids._]\r\n\r\nThe third disease of the anus is when the orifices of the\r\n_hemorrhoidal_ veins grow turgid, and shoot out something like\r\nsmall heads, which often discharge blood; the Greeks call them the\r\nhæmorrhoides[GN]. And this frequently happens to women in the mouth\r\nof the womb. And it is not safe to stop it in some people, who are\r\nnot weakened by the discharge of blood: for this serves for a drain,\r\nand is not a disease. And therefore some that have been cured, as the\r\nblood had no exit, have been seized with sudden and very dangerous\r\ndistempers, from the matter settling upon the præcordia and bowels.\r\nBut a man that feels bad effects from this discharge, ought to sit\r\ndown in a decoction of vervains; and to apply principally pomegranate\r\nbark powdered, with dry rose leaves; and some of those things, which\r\nstop blood. An inflammation sometimes comes on, especially when hard\r\nexcrements hurt the part. Then the patient must sit down in pure water,\r\nand foment the part with eggs, and apply the yolks with rose leaves\r\nbeat up with passum; and if the disorder be within, this must be put\r\nto it with the finger; if without, it must be applied spread upon a\r\ncloth. Those medicines too, which are calculated for recent fissures,\r\nare suitable here. And the same diet must be used in this, as in the\r\nformer cases. If these methods give but little relief, it is usual by\r\nthe application of caustic medicines to consume these small heads. But\r\nif they be inveterate, by the direction of Dionysius, sandarach is to\r\nbe sprinkled upon them; after that the following composition must be\r\napplied: of copper scales, orpiment, each p. v. *. stone lime p. viii.\r\n*. the next day, they must be punctured with a needle. By cauterizing\r\nthese small heads a cicatrix is formed(19), which prevents the\r\neffusion of blood. But whenever this is stopped, to avoid any dangerous\r\nconsequence from the suppression, the matter must be dissipated by\r\nmuch exercise; and besides both men, and such women, whose menstrual\r\ndischarge is stopped, ought sometimes to be bled in the arm.\r\n\r\n  [GN] αἱμοῤῥοἱδες.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Of a prolapsus of the anus or womb._]\r\n\r\nBut if the anus itself, or the mouth of the womb fall down (for that\r\nsometimes happens) it ought to be considered whether the part, which is\r\nprotruded, be clean, or covered with a mucous humour. If it be clean,\r\nthe patient ought to sit down in salt water, or a decoction of vervains\r\nor of pomegranate bark in water: but if moist, it must be washed with\r\na rough wine, and rubbed with burnt lees of wine. When it has been\r\ntreated in either way, it must be replaced; and an application made of\r\nbruised plantain, or willow leaves boiled in vinegar; over that, linen\r\nand wool: these must be tied on, and the legs bound close together.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Of a fungous ulcer._]\r\n\r\nThere sometimes appears an ulcer in the same part resembling a\r\nmushroom. This, if it be the winter-time, must be fomented with water\r\njust warm; if any other season, with cold; afterwards it must be\r\nsprinkled on copper scales, and over that cerate applied made of myrtle\r\noil, with the addition of a little scales, soot, and lime. If it is\r\nnot removed in this method, it must be consumed either by stronger\r\nmedicines(20) or the actual cautery.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. XIX.\r\n\r\nOF ULCERS IN THE FINGERS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe best cure for ulcers of long standing in the fingers is either\r\nlycium or lees of oil boiled; to either of which wine is added. A\r\ncaruncle here also sometimes recedes from the nails with great pain;\r\nthe Greeks call it pterygion[GO]. It is proper to dissolve as much\r\nround Melian alum in water, as to make it of the consistence of honey;\r\nthen to pour into it the same quantity of honey as there was of alum,\r\nand to stir it with a spatula, till it becomes of a saffron colour,\r\nand rub that over it; some people for the same purpose chuse to mix\r\nequal quantities of dry alum and honey, and boil them together to the\r\ndue consistence. If they are not extirpated by this method, they must\r\nbe cut off; then the fingers must be fomented with a decoction of\r\nvervains, and a medicine applied over them compounded thus; chalcitis,\r\npomegranate bark, and copper scales are incorporated with a mellow\r\nfig gently boiled, and honey; or equal quantities of burnt paper,\r\norpiment, and crude sulphur are mixed with cerate made of myrtle oil;\r\nor of rasile verdigrease p. i. *. copper scales p. ii. *. are brought\r\nto a consistence with a cyathus of honey; or equal parts of stone lime,\r\nchalcitis, and orpiment are mixed together. Which ever of these is\r\napplied, it must be covered with a linen cloth dipped in water. On the\r\nthird day, the finger must be opened, and what is dry, must be cut away\r\nas before, and the like dressing applied. If it does not yield to this\r\nmethod, it must be cleansed with a knife, and burnt with small irons,\r\nand cured like other burns.\r\n\r\n  [GO] πτερύγιον.\r\n\r\nBut where the nails are scabrous, they ought to be opened round, where\r\nthey are joined to the flesh; then some of the following composition\r\nmust be applied over them; of sandarach, sulphur, each p. ii. *. nitre,\r\norpiment, each p. iv. *. liquid resin p. viii. *. And this is to be\r\ntaken off on the third day. This medicine causes the spoiled nails to\r\nfall off and better to grow in their place.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA. CORNELIUS CELSUS\r\n\r\n        OF\r\n\r\n     MEDICINE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_BOOK VII._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThat surgery makes the third part of medicine, is both universally\r\nknown, and has been already observed. This does not indeed discard\r\nmedicines, and a proper regimen; but yet the principal part is\r\naccomplished by the hand. And the effect of this is the most evident\r\nof all the parts of medicine. For as fortune contributes a good deal\r\nto the cure of distempers, and the same things are often salutary,\r\noften fruitless; it may be doubted, whether the recovery be owing\r\nto physic, or the constitution. In those diseases also, in which\r\nwe chiefly make use of medicines, although their success be pretty\r\nevident, nevertheless it is plain, that health is both sought for\r\nby their means in vain, and often restored without them. As may be\r\nobserved with regard to the eyes, which after having long suffered from\r\nthe applications of physicians, sometimes recover of themselves. But\r\nin surgery it is manifest that the success, though it may be somewhat\r\npromoted by other means, is chiefly to be ascribed to this. Now this\r\nbranch, though it be the most ancient, yet has been more cultivated\r\nby Hippocrates the father of all medicine, than by his predecessors.\r\nAfterwards being separated from the other parts, it began to have its\r\npeculiar professors, and received considerable improvements in Egypt,\r\nas well as elsewhere, principally from Philoxenus, who has treated of\r\nthis part fully, and with great accuracy, in several volumes. Gorgias\r\nalso, and Sostratus, the two Herons, and the two Apollonii, and\r\nAmmonius Alexandrinus, and many other celebrated men, have each of them\r\nmade some discoveries. And at Rome too professors of no small note,\r\nand particularly of late Tryphon the father, and Euelpistus the son of\r\nPhleges, and Meges the most learned of them all, as appears from his\r\nwritings, by altering some things for the better have made considerable\r\nadditions to this art.\r\n\r\nA surgeon ought to be young, or at most but middle aged, to have a\r\nstrong and steady hand, never subject to tremble, and be no less\r\ndexterous with his left than his right hand; to have a quick and clear\r\nsight; to be bold, and so far void of pity, that he may have only in\r\nview the cure of him, whom he has taken in hand, and not in compassion\r\nto cries either make more haste than the case requires, or his cut less\r\nthan is necessary; but to do all, as if he was not moved by the shrieks\r\nof his patient.\r\n\r\nNow it may be asked what peculiarly belongs to this branch: because\r\nsurgeons assume to themselves the curing of many wounds and ulcers,\r\nwhich I have treated of elsewhere. I can very well suppose the same\r\nperson capable of performing all these: and since they are divided, I\r\nesteem him most, whose skill is most extensive. For my part, I have\r\nleft to this branch those cases, in which the physician(1) makes\r\nwound, where he does not find one; and those wounds and ulcers, in\r\nwhich I believe manual operation to be more useful than medicines;\r\nlastly whatever relates to the bones. Which things I shall consider\r\nin order, and deferring the bones to another book, I shall in this\r\nexplain the two former; so treating first of these, which are found\r\nindifferently in every part of the body, I shall proceed to those, that\r\nfall upon particular parts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. I.\r\n\r\nOF CONTUSIONS.\r\n\r\n\r\nContusions, in whatever part of the body they are, ought as soon as\r\npossible to be treated in this manner; the skin of the part, where the\r\npain is, must be cut in several places, and the _grumous_ blood issuing\r\nfrom them must be wiped away with the back of the knife. If it is not\r\ntaken in time, and there is a redness, so much of the skin as is red\r\n_must be cut_; if there is a tumour too, wherever that extends, the\r\nsame remedy is still the best. Then repellents are to be applied over\r\nit; and particularly sordid wool squeezed out of vinegar and oil. But\r\nif the hurt be more slight, the same applications without an incision\r\nmay perform the cure. And if nothing else is at hand, ashes, especially\r\nof burnt twigs; if they are not to be got, any other ashes mixed up\r\nwith vinegar, or even with water.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. II.\r\n\r\nOF THE OPERATIONS NECESSARY IN SUPPURATED TUMOURS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe foregoing case is easily managed. But there is more trouble\r\nwith those tumours, that come from an internal cause, and tend to\r\nsuppuration. That all these are kinds of abscesses, I have elsewhere\r\nshewn, and treated of the medicines proper for them: it now remains,\r\nthat I mention the manual operations necessary for their cure.\r\nWherefore it is requisite, before they grow hard, to cut the skin,\r\nand apply a cupping vessel to evacuate any bad and corrupted matter\r\nwhich may have been collected there: and this may be repeated a second\r\nand third time, till all the symptoms of an inflammation be gone.\r\nNevertheless, it is not right to trust(2) entirely to the cupping\r\nvessel.\r\n\r\nSometimes also it happens, though rarely, that a collection of pus\r\nis inclosed in a covering of its own: the ancients called this a\r\ncoat. Meges, because every coat is nervous, affirmed a nerve was not\r\ngenerated in a disorder, which destroyed the flesh, but that the pus\r\nbeing lodged below for a long time, was surrounded with a callosity.\r\nThis however has not the least relation to the method of cure; because\r\nthe same course, that ought to be pursued if it be a coat, is also\r\nnecessary if it be a callosity. And though it should be a callosity,\r\nyet as it invelops something, there is no reason against calling it\r\na coat. And then again, it is not uncommon for this to be found even\r\nbefore the suppuration is formed(3), and therefore what is below it\r\ncannot be extracted by a cupping vessel. But this is easily discovered,\r\nwhen the application of that instrument has made no change. Therefore,\r\nwhere-ever that happens, or when there is already a hardness, nothing\r\nis to be expected from this remedy: but as I have directed elsewhere,\r\neither the afflux of matter to the part must be diverted, or it must\r\nbe discussed, or brought to a perfect suppuration. If either of the\r\nformer has taken place, nothing further is necessary. If the pus has\r\nbeen maturated, in the armpits and groin an incision is rarely to be\r\nmade: likewise where-ever the abscess is but small; also where-ever\r\nthe malady is in the surface of the skin, or even in the flesh; unless\r\nthe weakness of the patient obliges us to lose no time. And it is\r\nsufficient by cataplasms to assist the pus to make its own way. For\r\nthe part, that has not been touched by an instrument, is generally\r\nfree from a scar. If the malady lies deeper, it ought to be considered\r\nwhether the part be nervous or not. For if it be nervous, it should\r\nbe opened by the actual cautery; the reason of which is, that a small\r\nwound may keep open longer for evacuating the pus, and the cicatrix\r\nafterwards may be small. But if there be nerves near it, the actual\r\ncautery is improper, lest convulsions follow, which may debilitate(4)\r\nthe limb; yet the assistance of the knife is necessary. The others may\r\nbe opened before they be quite mature: but amongst tendons the utmost\r\nripeness is to be waited for, that the skin may be thin, and the pus\r\nbrought close to it, that it may be the sooner found. And some again\r\nrequire a wound(5) in a straight direction, as those in the flesh:\r\nbut others render the skin extremely thin; and in such the whole\r\nsurface of it above the pus must be cut away. Now in all cases where\r\nthe knife is used, care must be taken, that the wounds be as small\r\nand as few in number as possible: with this caution, however, that we\r\ndo all the case requires, both with regard to size and number: for\r\nlarger cavities require broader incisions; sometimes even in two or\r\nthree different directions. And we must endeavour that the deepest\r\npart of the sinus shall have a free discharge, lest any of the humour\r\nsettle within, which by corroding the contiguous parts yet sound, may\r\nmake sinuses there. Cases also sometimes occur, in which the skin\r\nmust be taken off to a more considerable breadth. For when after long\r\ndistempers, the habit of the whole body has been vitiated, and the\r\nsinus is enlarged to a great compass, and the skin is pale; we may\r\ntake it for granted that it is already mortified, and will be useless:\r\ntherefore it is more proper to cut it off: and especially if this\r\nhappen about the larger joints, and the patient has been troubled with\r\na purging while he was confined to his bed, and he gains no flesh by\r\nthe nourishment he takes. But the excision should be made in the form\r\nof a myrtle leaf, that it may heal the more easily. And this rule must\r\nconstantly be observed, whenever a physician upon any account cuts away\r\nthe skin. After the pus is discharged, in the armpits and groin there\r\nis no need of lint, but a sponge squeezed out of wine must be laid on.\r\nIn the other parts, if lint is equally needless, a little honey must\r\nbe infused to cleanse it; then agglutinants are to be applied: if lint\r\nbe necessary, over it also in like manner ought to be laid a sponge\r\nsqueezed out of wine in the same way. When lint is necessary, and when\r\nnot, has been determined elsewhere. The other directions are to be\r\nobserved when the suppurated tumour is cut, which I gave for one, that\r\nhas been broke by medicines.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. III.\r\n\r\nOF THE GOOD OR BAD SYMPTOMS OF SUPPURATIONS.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is soon known from the nature of the symptoms, how a cure advances,\r\nand what event is to be hoped or feared: and these are commonly the\r\nsame with what have been laid down in wounds. For they are good signs\r\nto sleep, to breathe easily, not to be troubled with thirst, not to\r\nloathe food, if there has been a slight fever, to be free of it:\r\nalso that the pus be white, smooth, and not fetid. The bad signs are\r\nwakefulness, difficulty in breathing, thirst, loathing of food, a\r\nfever, and the pus black, or feculent, and fetid: also a hemorrhage\r\nin the process of the cure; or if before the cavity is filled up\r\nwith flesh, the lips become callous, and the flesh there be dull of\r\nsensation, and spongy. But for a person to faint either in the dressing\r\nor afterwards, is worst of all. Moreover, if the fever cease suddenly,\r\nbefore the suppuration is begun, or if it continue after the discharge\r\nof the pus, these are just grounds for fear. There is room to fear\r\nalso, if the wound is not sensible of corrosive medicines. But whatever\r\nsymptoms shall happen to arise, it is the part of a physician to\r\nendeavour the recovery of his patient. Therefore, as often as he shall\r\nopen a wound, he ought to wash it, if it seems necessary to repel the\r\nhumour, with a mixture of wine and rain water, or with a decoction of\r\nlentils in water: if it needs cleansing, with mulse; and to apply the\r\nsame dressings again. When the humour shall appear to be stopt, and the\r\nulcer clean, it will be convenient to promote the growth of the flesh,\r\nand dress the ulcer with equal parts of wine and honey, and apply a\r\nsponge dipt in wine and oil of roses, which things are incarning. A\r\nproper regimen however, as I have observed elsewhere, is more effectual\r\nfor this purpose: that is, when the fever is removed, and the appetite\r\nrestored, bathing now and then, daily but mild gestation, and such\r\nkinds of food and drink as are of the most nourishing nature. All which\r\nrules also hold with regard to an abscess, that has been broken by\r\nmedicines. But because it is hardly possible to cure a large tumour\r\nwithout the knife, the mention of these has been reserved to this place.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. IV.\r\n\r\nOF FISTULAS.\r\n\r\n\r\nWith regard to fistulas, if they penetrate pretty deep, so that a\r\ncollyrium cannot reach the bottom of them, if they are tortuous, or\r\nconsist of several sinuses, operations are more useful than medicines;\r\nand those, that run in a transverse direction below the skin, give less\r\ntrouble than such as go directly inward. Therefore, if the fistula\r\nbe transverse under the skin, a probe ought to be introduced, and an\r\nincision made upon that. If it be tortuous, its windings are to be\r\nfollowed by the probe and knife. And the same course must be taken, if\r\nseveral of them appear like rivulets _uniting their streams_. When we\r\nhave reached to the end of the fistula, all the callosity must be cut\r\nout, and fibulae applied to it with medicines to agglutinate. But if it\r\npoints directly inward, when its direction is found by a probe, that\r\nsinus must be cut out: then a fibula put upon the lips of the skin,\r\nand agglutinating medicines laid over it; or if the ulcer be very foul\r\n(which sometimes happens from a carious bone) when that also is cured,\r\nmedicines to promote a digestion.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Of fistulas amongst the ribs._]\r\n\r\nIt is common for fistulas to extend beneath the ribs. When this case\r\noccurs, the rib in that part must be cut through on both sides, and\r\ntaken out, lest any thing corrupt be left within. It is usual for them\r\nalso, when they have got through the ribs, to penetrate the transverse\r\nseptum, that divides the intestines from the superior viscera. Which\r\ncircumstance may be known, both from the situation, and from the\r\nviolence of the pain, and because sometimes the air comes out with the\r\nmatter, as it were bubbling, and particularly when the patient keeps\r\nin his breath. For this case there is no remedy. In the other kinds\r\nabout the ribs, which are curable, greasy medicines are hurtful, and\r\n_therefore_ we should use such as are adapted to wounds: but the best\r\napplication is dry lint, or if any thing requires to be cleansed, the\r\nsame dipped in honey.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Of fistulas in the belly._]\r\n\r\nThere is no bone within the skin of the belly; but fistulas in that\r\npart are extremely dangerous; insomuch that Sostratus believed them\r\nincurable. That they are not always so, experience has shewn. And\r\nindeed, which may seem very wonderful, a fistula opposite to the\r\nliver and spleen, and stomach, is more safe than one opposite to the\r\nintestines: not that the thing is of its own nature more pernicious\r\nthere, but because it exposes to a danger of another kind. The reason\r\nof which fact some authors have but little understood, though their\r\nexperience convinced them of this difficulty. For the belly itself is\r\noften wounded by a weapon, and the intestines, that have fallen out,\r\nare replaced, and the wound united by sutures: the manner of doing\r\nwhich I shall point out presently. Therefore, when a small fistula\r\nhas even penetrated the abdomen, it may be cut out, and the lips of\r\nit joined by a suture. But if the fistula spreads wider within, upon\r\nits being cut out, it must necessarily leave a pretty large vacuity,\r\nwhich cannot be sewed up without great violence; especially on the\r\ninternal side, where there is a kind of membrane, which the Greeks call\r\nperitonaeum, that surrounds the abdomen. Therefore, as soon as a person\r\nbegins to walk or move, the suture breaks, and the intestines are let\r\nloose, so that the patient must perish. But the case is not always\r\ndesperate; and therefore, we must attempt the cure of smaller fistulas\r\nthere.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Of fistulas in the anus._]\r\n\r\nFistulas in the anus require a particular treatment. A probe being\r\nput into them, an incision must be made in the skin at its further\r\nend: then the probe must be drawn out at the new orifice with a thread\r\nfollowing it, which was put through an eye made in the other end for\r\nthe purpose. There the thread must be taken hold of, and tied to the\r\nother end, that it may gently take hold of the skin above the fistula:\r\nand the thread should be made of crude lint(6), double or triple,\r\nand so twisted as to make one string. In the mean time the patient\r\nmay go about his business, walk, bathe, and eat, just as if he were\r\nin the most perfect health. Only loosing this knot(7) twice a day,\r\nthe string must be drawn in such a manner, that the part, which was\r\nabove, may then be within the fistula. And the thread must not be\r\nsuffered to rot, but every third day, the knot must be untied, and at\r\nits one end must be fixed a fresh ligature, which when the old one is\r\ndrawn out, must be left in the fistula with a like knot. For thus it\r\ngradually cuts the skin that is above the fistula: and, at the same\r\ntime, the part that has been eat through by the thread, heals; whilst\r\nthe remainder, which is pinched by the thread, continues to be cut by\r\nit. This method of cure is long, but is attended with no pain.\r\n\r\nThose, that are for making quick dispatch, ought to tie the skin\r\ntight with the string, that it may be the sooner cut; and at night to\r\nintroduce some small slips of a penecillum, that the skin may be made\r\nthin by the same means that it is distended; however this occasions\r\npain. The dispatch, as well as the pain, is increased, if both the\r\nstring and the penecillum be turned with some one of those medicines,\r\nwhich I mentioned, for consuming a callosity. It may happen, however,\r\nthat the use of the knife may be necessary, even in this part, if the\r\nfistula points inward, or consists of several sinuses. Wherefore in\r\nthese kinds, the probe must be introduced, and the skin must be cut\r\nin two lines, so that betwixt them a very small habenula may be cut\r\nout(8), to prevent the lips from uniting presently; and that room\r\nmay be left for pledgits of lint, as few of which as possible ought\r\nto be laid on; and the same course must be pursued as was directed in\r\nabscesses. But if, from one orifice, there shall be several sinuses,\r\nthat sinus, that runs straight, must be opened with a knife, and the\r\nothers, that branch from it, which will then appear, must be tied with\r\na ligature. If any one penetrate so deeply, that an instrument cannot\r\nbe safely used, a collyrium must be put in.\r\n\r\nThe food, in all these cases, whether the treatment be by an operation,\r\nor by medicines, ought to be moist; the quantity of drink pretty\r\nliberal, and for a long time water. And when the flesh begins to sprout\r\nup, then indeed the bath may be used, but sparingly, and such food as\r\nplumps the body.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. V.\r\n\r\nOF EXTRACTING WEAPONS OUT OF THE BODY.\r\n\r\n\r\nWeapons, that lodge in the body, are very often troublesome to extract.\r\nFor there are some difficulties, which arise from their different\r\nforms; others from the situation of the parts, into which they have\r\npenetrated. Now every weapon is extracted, either on that side, where\r\nit entered, or on that, to which it points. In the first case it\r\nreturns by the way itself made: in the other, it receives one from the\r\nknife; for the flesh is cut directly upon the point of the weapon.\r\nIf the weapon does not lie deep, but is in the surface of the flesh,\r\nor at least has not past through large veins and nervous parts, the\r\nbest method is to pull it out by the way it entered. But if the space,\r\nthrough which the weapon must return, be greater than that, which is to\r\nbe laid open, and it has already past through veins and nerves, it is\r\nmore expedient to open what remains, and extract it that way; for it is\r\nboth nearer at hand, and is drawn out with more safety. And in one of\r\nthe larger limbs, if the point of the weapon has past beyond the middle\r\nof it, it will heal the more readily for being open quite through, as\r\nthe remedies will act at both extremities of the wound. But if the\r\nweapon is to be brought back the same way, the wound must be enlarged,\r\nthat it may move the more easily, and occasion the less inflammation;\r\nwhich will be considerable, if the body be lacerated by the weapon as\r\nit returns. And in like manner, if an opening be made on the opposite\r\npart, it ought to be so large, as not to be increased afterwards by\r\nthe weapon passing through it. In either case, the greatest caution\r\nmust be used not to cut a tendon, or a large vein, or an artery. When\r\nany of these are exposed, it must be laid hold of with a blunt hook,\r\nand drawn aside from the knife. When an incision is made large enough,\r\nthe weapon must be taken out: then also the same method, and the same\r\nprecaution are to be used, lest any of the abovementioned parts should\r\nbe injured, which lie under the weapon, that is to be extracted.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Of arrows._]\r\n\r\nThe foregoing directions are general: besides which, there are some\r\nparticular rules for the several kinds of weapons, which I shall\r\nimmediately subjoin. Nothing is so easily lodged in the body as an\r\narrow, and it goes to the greatest depth. The reasons are, both that it\r\nmoves with great force, and because it is small. Therefore, it must be\r\nextracted more frequently on the opposite part, than on that by which\r\nit entered, and especially because it is generally surrounded with\r\nbeards, which lacerate more, if they be drawn backward than forward.\r\nBut an orifice being made on the opposite part, the flesh ought to\r\nbe opened by an instrument made in the form of the Greek letter ν;\r\nand when the point appears, if the shaft adheres to it, it must be\r\npushed forward, till it can be taken hold of at the opposite part, and\r\nextracted. If that is already broke off, and only the iron head is\r\nwithin, the point must be taken hold of by the fingers, or a forceps,\r\nand thus pulled out. And there is no other method of extracting it,\r\nwhen it is thought adviseable to pull it out by the orifice it entered\r\nat: for after the wound is enlarged, either the shaft, if that be\r\nlodged within, must be pulled out; or if that be not there, the iron\r\nitself. But if the beards are visible, and they are short and small,\r\nthey ought to be broke off with a forceps, and the weapon, when freed\r\nof them, to be brought out; if they are larger and stronger, they must\r\nbe covered with writing reeds split, to prevent their lacerating any\r\npart, and thus pulled out. This is the method observed in extracting\r\narrows.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Of broad weapons._]\r\n\r\nBut if a person has a broad weapon lodged within his flesh, it is not\r\nproper to draw it out at the opposite part, lest we add another great\r\nwound to the large one already made. It must therefore be pulled out\r\nwith a certain kind of iron instrument, which the Greeks call the\r\ngraphiscus of Diocles[GP], because it was invented by Diocles, whom I\r\nhave already taken notice of among the ancient and greatest physicians.\r\nThis is a plate of iron, or sometimes of copper, at the one end,\r\nhaving two claws turned downwards on each side; the other perforated\r\nand folded back on each side; bent a little at that extremity, which\r\nhas the claws; and likewise on the other, which is perforated. This\r\nis introduced transversely, hard by the weapon; and then, when it\r\nhas reached its point, it is turned a little, that it may receive\r\nthe weapon into the perforation. When the point is in the hole, the\r\noperator, clapping two of his fingers to the claws at the other end,\r\ndraws out at once his instrument and the weapon.\r\n\r\n  [GP] γραφίσκος Διοκλέους.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Of leaden bullets, &c._]\r\n\r\nA third kind of weapon, which requires sometimes to be pulled out, is\r\na leaden bullet, or a stone, or some such thing, which having broke\r\nthrough the skin, is entirely lodged within. In all these cases, the\r\nwound must be enlarged, and what is within must be extracted by a\r\nforceps the way it entered.\r\n\r\nBut there is an additional difficulty attending every wound, where the\r\nweapon is either fixed in a bone, or has sunk into an articulation\r\nbetween two bones. If, in a bone, the weapon must be moved to and fro,\r\ntill the part, which gripes the point, gives way, and then the weapon\r\nmust be extracted, either with the hand, or a forceps. Which is also\r\nthe method of extracting the teeth. And it is very rare that the weapon\r\ndoes not follow in this way. But if it still remains, it may be forced\r\nout with some kind of instrument. The last resource, when it is not\r\nextracted, is to make a perforation near it by a terebra, and from that\r\nopening, to cut the bone in the form of the letter v, opposite to the\r\nweapon, in such a manner, that the opening of the lines be directed\r\ntowards the weapon; when this is done, it must necessarily give way,\r\nand be easily taken out.\r\n\r\nIf it has made its way into an articulation between two bones, the two\r\nlimbs must be bound up with rollers and straps, and by means of these\r\ndrawn contrary ways, to stretch the tendons: which being extended,\r\nwill leave a larger space between the bones, so that the weapon may\r\nbe extracted without difficulty. Care must be taken, as I observed\r\nin other cases, in its extraction, that no nerve, vein, or artery be\r\nwounded by the weapon, whilst it is extracting, _which is to be guarded\r\nagainst_ by the method mentioned before.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Of poisonous weapons._]\r\n\r\nBut if a person be wounded by a poisoned weapon, all that is above\r\nmentioned being, if possible, still more expeditiously executed, he\r\nmust also be treated in the method prescribed for one that has drunk\r\npoison, or been bit by a serpent. The treatment of the wound itself,\r\nafter the extraction of the weapon, is the same as if nothing had been\r\nlodged there; of which I have said enough elsewhere.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. VI.\r\n\r\nOF A GANGLION, MELICERIS, ATHEROMA, STEATOMA, AND OTHER TUBERCLES OF\r\nTHE HEAD.\r\n\r\n\r\nThese are cases that occur in any part of the body indifferently: the\r\nrest have certain seats, which I am going to speak of, beginning with\r\nthose in the head. In this a great number and variety of tubercles\r\nrise, called ganglia[GQ] melicerides[GR], atheromata[GS]; there are\r\nsome other kinds, to which authors give different names; to which I\r\nshall also add steatomata[GT]: which though they often arise in the\r\nneck, and in the armpits, and sides, I have not mentioned separately;\r\nsince all of them differ but little, and neither are threatening, nor\r\nrequire any different treatment from each other. Now all these rise\r\nfrom a very small beginning, and increase gradually for a long time,\r\nand are inclosed each in a coat of its own. Some of them are hard, and\r\nresist pressure, others are soft and yielding; some of them are bald\r\nin a part, others remain covered with hair, and are commonly without\r\npain. What their contents are, though it may be pretty well guessed\r\nat, yet cannot be certainly known, till they be taken out. However,\r\ngenerally in these that resist, there are found either some stony\r\nsubstance, or a number of hairs concreted together: but in those that\r\nyield, something resembling honey, or thin pulticula, or the scrapings\r\nof cartilage, or insensible or bloody flesh; and these are commonly\r\nof different colours. And for the most part ganglia are elastic: the\r\natheroma contains a liquor like thin pulticula: the meliceris a more\r\nliquid one, which therefore fluctuates upon being pressed: there is\r\na fat substance in the steatoma, and that generally has the largest\r\ncircumference, and so relaxes the whole surface of the skin above it,\r\nas to make it slide backward and forward; whereas, in the rest, it is\r\nmore bound. It is proper first to shave them all if they be covered\r\nwith hair, and then to cut them through the middle, that whatever was\r\ncollected within may be evacuated. But the coat of the steatoma must\r\nalso be cut; because it is not easily separated from the skin and\r\nsubjacent flesh. In the others the coat is to be preserved entire: and\r\nimmediately, when it appears white and tense, it must be separated by\r\nthe handle of the knife from the skin and flesh, and taken out together\r\nwith its contents. If, however, it should happen, that the lower side\r\nof the coat adheres to a muscle, lest that be wounded, the upper side\r\nmust be taken away, and the lower left in its place. When the whole\r\nis extracted, the lips must be brought together, and a fibula put\r\nupon them, and over that an agglutinating medicine. When either the\r\nwhole coat, or any part of it is left behind, medicines to promote a\r\ndigestion must be applied.\r\n\r\n  [GQ] γάγγλια.\r\n\r\n  [GR] μελικηρίδες.\r\n\r\n  [GS] ἀθερώματα.\r\n\r\n  [GT] στεατώματα.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. VII.\r\n\r\nOF THE DISEASES OF THE EYES, WHICH ARE CURED BY MANUAL OPERATIONS.\r\n\r\n\r\nBut as the foregoing disorders do not differ much either in their\r\nnature, or method of cure, so these in the eyes, which require manual\r\noperations, are both different in their kinds, and require different\r\nmethods of cure.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Of vesicles in the upper eye-lids._]\r\n\r\nIn the upper eye-lids then it is common for fat and heavy vesicles to\r\nrise, which scarcely allow the eye to be raised, and occasion gentle,\r\nbut constant fluxes of gum in the eyes. And they commonly happen to\r\nchildren. _In this case_, it is necessary to compress the eye with\r\ntwo fingers, and thus stretching the skin, to cut with the knife in a\r\ntransverse line, with a very light hand, in such a manner as not to\r\nwound the vesicle, and so that it may pass out when a way is made for\r\nit; then to catch hold of it with the fingers, and pull it out: for it\r\neasily separates. After this the part ought to be anointed over with\r\nany of these collyriums, that are used in lippitudes; by which means it\r\nis covered with a cicatrix in a very few days. It is more troublesome,\r\nwhen the vesicle is cut: for it discharges its humour, and cannot be\r\nlaid hold of after, because of its smallness. If that accident should\r\nhappen, one of the medicines that promotes a digestion, may be laid on.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Of a crithe._]\r\n\r\nIn the eye-lid, likewise, above the lashes, there grows a small\r\ntubercle, which from its resemblance to a barley-corn, is, by the\r\nGreeks, called crithe[GU]. It is contained in a coat, and seldom\r\nmaturates. Upon this should be applied hot bread, or wax heated now and\r\nthen, provided the degree of heat be no more, than the part can easily\r\nbear: for by this method it is often discussed, sometimes maturated. If\r\npus appear, it ought to be divided by a knife, and the contained humour\r\nsqueezed out: and to be afterwards treated with the same warmth, and\r\nanointed, till it recover a sound state.\r\n\r\n  [GU] κριθὴ.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Of chalazia._]\r\n\r\nOther tubercles not unlike this, grow in the eye-lids; but however not\r\nof the same form, and also moveable, when they are impelled this way or\r\nthat by the finger: which because of their resemblance to hail-stones,\r\nthe Greeks call chalazia[GV]. These ought to be cut on the external\r\nside, if they be immediately under the skin; on the internal, if they\r\nlie below the cartilage; after that, they must be separated by the\r\nhandle of the knife from the sound parts. And if the wound be on the\r\ninternal side, it must be anointed at first with mild, and afterwards\r\nmore acrid medicines; if, on the external, an agglutinating plaister\r\nmust be applied over it.\r\n\r\n  [GV] χαλάζια.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Of the unguis._]\r\n\r\nThe unguis, called by the Greeks, pterygium[GW], is a small nervous\r\nmembrane, which arising from the angle of the eye, sometimes reaches to\r\nthe pupil, and obstructs the sight. It oftener begins from the angle,\r\nnear the nose, sometimes too from that towards the temples. It is no\r\ndifficult matter to discuss this, when recent, by the medicines, which\r\nlessen cicatrices in the eyes. If it be of long standing, and has\r\nacquired some thickness, it ought to be cut out. After an abstinence\r\nof one day, the patient must be placed in a seat, either with his\r\nface opposite to the physician, or with his back to him, in such a\r\nmanner, that he may recline his head upon his breast. Some, if the\r\ndisease be in the left eye, chuse to have him set with his face to\r\nthe physician; if in the right, in the reclined posture. One eye-lid\r\nought to be opened by an assistant, and the other by the physician.\r\nIf the physician face him, he must take hold of the lower one; if he\r\nbe reclined, the upper one. Then the physician is to fix under the\r\nextremity of the unguis, a small sharp hook, with its point turned a\r\nlittle inward; and to let go the eye-lid, which is then to be held\r\nby an assistant, and taking hold of the hook, he is to lift up the\r\nunguis, and pass a needle through, drawing a thread after it; then to\r\nlay aside the needle, and take hold of the ends of the thread, and by\r\nthem raising up the unguis, if it adheres any where to the eye, to\r\nseparate it by the handle of the knife, till he come to the angle; then\r\nalternately sometimes to slacken, sometimes to draw it, that so both\r\nits origin and the extremity of the angle may be found. For there is a\r\ndouble danger attends it; either lest some part of the unguis be left,\r\nwhich being ulcerated is hardly ever cured, or lest the caruncle be\r\ncut away from the angle; for if the unguis be drawn away with too much\r\nforce, that also follows, and comes away. If it is torn off, an orifice\r\nis opened, through which afterwards a humour always descends, which\r\nthe Greeks call rhyas[GX]. The true termination then of the angle must\r\nbe found out. When that plainly appears, the knife is to be used, the\r\nunguis not being too straight drawn; and then this small membrane is\r\nto be cut out in such a manner, that no part of the angle be wounded.\r\nAfterwards lint covered with honey must be laid on, and over that a\r\nlinen cloth, and either spunge, or sordid wool. The following days the\r\neye must be opened daily, lest the eye-lids be agglutinated together by\r\na cicatrix (for that is also a third danger) and lint be put on in the\r\nsame way: lastly, it must be anointed with a collyrium, that cicatrizes\r\nulcers.\r\n\r\n  [GW] πτερύγιον.\r\n\r\n  [GX] ῥυὰς.\r\n\r\nBut this operation should be performed in the spring, or at least\r\nbefore winter. Which circumstance, though it belongs to several places,\r\nit will be sufficient to mention once for all. For there are two kinds\r\nof cures; one, in which we are not at liberty to chuse a time, but that\r\nmust be laid hold of, that offers, as in wounds and fistulas; another,\r\nin which we are not pressed for time; but it is quite safe and easy to\r\nwait the most convenient season; as is the case in these disorders,\r\nwhich both increase slowly, and are not extremely painful. In such, we\r\nmust defer it till spring; or if there is any urgent circumstance, the\r\nautumn however, is better than the winter or summer; and of that the\r\nmiddle, when the excessive heats are gone, and the colds not yet set\r\nin. Now the more necessary the part is, whose cure shall be undertaken,\r\nthe greater will the danger be it is exposed to. And often by how much\r\nlarger the wound is to be made, so much the more must the season of the\r\nyear be regarded.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Of an encanthis._]\r\n\r\nFrom the operation for the unguis, as I observed, disorders arise,\r\nwhich may also sometimes proceed from other causes. For sometimes after\r\nthe imperfect excision of an unguis, or upon some other occasion, a\r\ntubercle grows in the angle, which hinders the entire opening of the\r\neye-lids; the Greek name for it is encanthis[GY]. It ought to be laid\r\nhold of with a hook, and cut round; and here also the operator must be\r\ncautious not to cut away any thing from the angle itself. Then a small\r\npiece of lint must be sprinkled either with cadmia, or copperas; and\r\nthe eye-lids being opened it must be introduced into that angle, and\r\nbound over in the same manner as the former; and for some following\r\ndays must be dressed in like manner, first bathing it with water, just\r\nwarm, or even cold water.\r\n\r\n  [GY] ἐγκανθὶς.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Of the ancyloblepharon._]\r\n\r\nSometimes the eye-lids grow together, and the eye cannot be opened.\r\nWhich is often attended with this disorder besides, that the eye-lids\r\nadhere to the white of the eye; that is when an ulcer in either of\r\nthem has been negligently cured. For as it heals, what might, and\r\nought to have been separated, will be agglutinated; both species of\r\nthe distemper is called by the Greeks ancyloblepharon[GZ]. When the\r\neye-lids only cohere, they are separated without difficulty; but\r\nsometimes to no purpose: for they are agglutinated again. However trial\r\nought to be made; because the case often turns out well. Therefore\r\nthe broad end of the probe must be introduced betwixt them, and the\r\neye-lids separated by that; then small penecilla are to be put between\r\nthem, till the ulceration of the part be cured. But when the eye-lid\r\nadheres to the white of the eye itself, Heraclides the Tarentine\r\nadvises to cut under it gently with a knife with great caution, lest\r\nany thing be cut away either from the eye, or the eye-lid; and if\r\nthat cannot be entirely avoided, rather to take something from the\r\neye-lid. After these let the eye be anointed with such medicines as\r\ncure an asperity; and the eye-lid be inverted every day, not only that\r\nthe medicine may be applied to the ulcer, but also to prevent its\r\nadhesion: the patient himself must also be charged to raise it often\r\nwith two fingers. I do not remember an instance of one person cured\r\nby this method. Meges too tells us he tried many ways, and never was\r\nsuccessful; for the eye-lid always adhered again to the eye.\r\n\r\n  [GZ] ἀγκυλοβλέθαρον.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Of the aegilops._]\r\n\r\nAgain in that angle, that is next the nose, from some disorder, a kind\r\nof small fistula is opened, through which gum(9) perpetually distils;\r\nthe Greeks call it ægilops[HA]. And this gives constant uneasiness\r\nto the eye; sometimes also eating through the bone, it penetrates to\r\nthe nostrils. This sometimes is of a cancerous nature; when the veins\r\nare tense and crooked, the colour of it is pale, the skin hard, and\r\nirritated by a slight touch, and it raises an inflammation in the\r\ncontiguous parts. It is dangerous to attempt the cure of those, that\r\nare cancerous: for it even hastens death. And it is needless to meddle\r\nwith such as reach to the nostrils: for neither do they heal. But the\r\ncure of these in the angle may be attempted; though it should be known\r\nhowever that it is difficult; and the nearer to the angle the opening\r\nis, so much the more difficult, because there is a very little room\r\nfor the management of the hand; yet it is easier to cure the disorder\r\nwhen recent. The top of the opening must be taken hold of with a small\r\nhook; and then all the cavity as I directed in fistulas, must be cut\r\nout to the bone; and the eye and other contiguous parts being well\r\ncovered, the bone must be strongly cauterized with a hot iron. But if\r\nit be already affected with a caries, that a thicker scale may cast\r\noff, some apply caustic medicines; as copperas, or chalcitis, or rasile\r\nverdigrease: which method is both slower, and not so effectual. When\r\nthe bone is cauterized, the remaining part of the cure is the same as\r\nin other burns.\r\n\r\n  [HA] αἰγίλωψ.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Of hairs in the eye lashes irritating the eye._]\r\n\r\nThe hairs of the eye-lids sometimes irritate the eye; and that from\r\ntwo causes. For sometimes the skin of the eye-lid is relaxed, and\r\nfalls down; whence it happens, that the lashes are turned in upon\r\nthe eye itself, because the cartilage is not also relaxed; at other\r\ntimes, beside the natural row of hairs, another grows under it, which\r\npoint directly inward upon the eye. The methods of cure are these. If\r\npreternatural hairs have grown, an iron needle thin and broad, like a\r\nspatha(10), must be put into the fire, and when it is red-hot, the\r\neye-lid being lift up in such a manner, that the offending lashes are\r\nin the view of the operator, it must be passed from the angle close to\r\nthe roots of the hair, till it move over the third part of the eye-lid;\r\nthen it must be applied a second and third time, as far as the other\r\nangle. The consequence of which is, that all the roots of the hairs\r\nbeing burnt, die away. Then a medicine to prevent an inflammation must\r\nbe applied: and when the eschars have cast off, it must be brought to\r\ncicatrize. This kind heals very easily. Some alledge that it is proper\r\nto pierce the external part of the eye-lid near the eye-lashes with a\r\nneedle, which must be passed through with a woman’s hair doubled for a\r\nthread; and when the needle has gone through, that the offending hair\r\nmust be taken up into the loop of the woman’s hair, and by that drawn\r\nupward to the superior part of the eye-lid, and there to be glued down\r\nto the flesh, and a medicine applied to close up the orifice thus made:\r\nfor that this will cause the eye-lash to point afterwards externally.\r\nThis in the first place cannot be practised, but upon a pretty long\r\nhair; whereas they generally grow short there. And then if there be\r\nseveral hairs, the patient must suffer a long torture, and the needle\r\npassing so often through will raise a great inflammation. Lastly, when\r\nany humour is settled there, the eye being irritated both before by the\r\nhairs, and afterwards by the perforations of the eye-lids, it is hardly\r\npossible to prevent the glutinous matter, which fastens the hair, from\r\nbeing dissolved: and thus of course the hair returns to the place, from\r\nwhence it was drawn away.\r\n\r\nThe method of cure for a relaxed eye-lid, which is universally\r\npractised, never fails of success. For the eye being closed, one must\r\ntake hold of the middle part of the skin of the eye-lid, whether it be\r\nthe upper or the lower, with his fingers, and raise it; then consider\r\nhow much must be taken away, to reduce it to its natural condition.\r\nFor there are two dangers attending this case; lest if too much be cut\r\noff, the eye cannot be covered; if too little, the end be not obtained,\r\nand the patient have suffered to no purpose. The part, which it shall\r\nbe thought needful to cut, must be marked by two lines with ink in\r\nsuch a manner, that betwixt the range of hairs and the line nearest\r\nto it, some space may be left for the needle to lay hold of. These\r\nthings being determined, the knife is to be used: and if it be the\r\nupper eye-lid, the incision next the eye-lashes must be made first;\r\nif the inferior one, last: and it must begin in the left eye, at the\r\nangle next the temple; in the right, at the angle next the nose; and\r\nwhat lies between the two lines must be cut out. Then the lips of the\r\nwound are to be joined together by a single stitch, and the eye must\r\nbe covered; and if the eye-lid does not descend far enough, it must\r\nbe relaxed; if too much, it must be either straiter drawn, or a small\r\nhabenula again cut off from that lip of the wound, which is farthest\r\nfrom the eye-lashes. When it is cut off, other stitches must be added,\r\nnot above three. Moreover a scarification must be made in the upper\r\neye-lid, under the roots of the eye-lashes, that being raised from the\r\ninferior part they may point upwards: and this alone will be sufficient\r\nfor the cure, if they are but little turned in. The lower eyelid does\r\nnot need this process. When these are done, a spunge squeezed out\r\nof cold water must be bound on: the day following an agglutinating\r\nplaister should be applied. On the fourth, the stitches must be\r\ntaken away, and the wound anointed with a collyrium, to prevent an\r\ninflammation.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Of the lagophthalmus._]\r\n\r\nSometimes from this operation, when too much of the skin is cut away,\r\nit happens, that the eye cannot be covered. And this sometimes proceeds\r\nfrom another cause. The Greeks call the disorder lagophthalmos[HB].\r\nWhen too much of the eye-lid is wanting, there is no remedy for it;\r\nif but a small part, it may be cured. An arched incision must be made\r\nin the skin a little below the eye-brow, with its horns pointing\r\ndownward. The wound ought to go as deep as the cartilage, but without\r\ninjuring it: for if that be cut, the eye-lid falls down, and cannot\r\nafterwards be raised. Let the skin then be only divided, so as to\r\nallow it to descend a little in the lower part of the eye; which will\r\nbe the consequence of the wound’s gaping above. Let lint be put into\r\nit to prevent the union of the divided skin, and to generate a little\r\nflesh in the middle: and when this has filled up the part, the eye is\r\nafterwards properly covered _by the eye-lid_.\r\n\r\n  [HB] λαγώφθαλμος, or hare’s eye, outward.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Of an ectropium._]\r\n\r\nAs it is a disorder of the upper eye-lid not to descend far enough to\r\ncover the eye, so there is a disease of the lower, in which it is not\r\nraised high enough, but hangs down, and cannot be brought close to the\r\nother. And this also sometimes proceeds from a similar fault in the\r\ncure, sometimes even from old age. The Greeks call it ectropium[HC].\r\nIf it happens from a faulty cure, the treatment is the same as in the\r\nforegoing case: only the horns of the wound are turned towards the\r\ncheeks, and not to the eye. If it proceed from old age, the whole of it\r\nmust be cauterized externally with a thin plate of iron; then anointed\r\nwith honey; and from the fourth day fomented with hot water, and\r\nanointed with medicines to bring on a cicatrix.\r\n\r\n  [HC] ἐκτρόπιον, from turning.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Of the staphyloma._]\r\n\r\nThese then are the general disorders, that commonly occur in the parts\r\nabout the eye, the angles, and eye-lids. In the eye itself the external\r\ncoat is sometimes raised, either from the rupture or relaxation of some\r\nof the internal membranes; and it resembles a raisin stone in its form,\r\nwhence the Greeks call it a staphyloma[HD]. There are two methods of\r\ncure for it. One is to pass through the middle, at the root of it, a\r\nneedle with a double thread; then to tie tight the ends of one of the\r\nthreads above, and of the other below; which by cutting it gradually\r\nmay bring it off. The other is, to cut out from its surface about the\r\nbigness of a lentil; then to rub in spodium or cadmia. When either\r\nof these is done, the white of an egg must be spread upon wool and\r\napplied; and afterwards the eye must be fomented with the steam of hot\r\nwater, and anointed with mild medicines.\r\n\r\n  [HD] σταφύλωμα.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Of clavi._]\r\n\r\nCallous tubercles in the white of the eye are called clavi; which name\r\nis given them from their figure. The best method is to pierce them at\r\ntheir very roots with a needle; and below that to cut them off, and\r\nthen to anoint with mild medicines.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Description of the eye._]\r\n\r\nI have already elsewhere mentioned a cataract, because when recent,\r\nit is often removed by medicines. But when it is of long standing, it\r\nrequires a manual operation, and one, which may be reckoned amongst the\r\nnicest. Before I treat of this, I shall give a short account of the\r\nnature of the eye; the knowledge of which, as it is of importance in\r\nseveral other parts, so it is peculiarly necessary here. The eye then\r\nhas two external coats; the exterior of which by the Greeks is called\r\nceratoides[HE]; and this, where it is white, is pretty thick, but\r\nbefore the pupil is thinner. The interior coat is joined to this, in\r\nthe middle where the pupil is, and is concave, with a small aperture;\r\nround the pupil it is thin, but at a distance from it, something\r\nthicker; and by the Greeks is called chorioides[HF]. As these two coats\r\nsurround the internal part of the eye, they again join behind it, and\r\nbecoming finer, and uniting together, pass through the opening, which\r\nis between the bones, to the membrane of the brain, and are fixed to\r\nit. Under these, in the part where the pupil is, there is a void space;\r\nthen again below, is an exceeding fine coat, which Herophilus called\r\narachnoides[HG], the middle part of which subsides, and in that cavity\r\nis contained somewhat, which from its resemblance to glass the Greeks\r\ncall hyaloides[HH]. This is neither liquid, nor dry; but seems to be a\r\nconcreted humour; from the colour of which, that of the pupil is either\r\nblack, or grey, though the external coat be white. This is inclosed\r\nby a small membrane, which proceeds from the internal part of the\r\neye. Under these is a drop of humour resembling the white of an egg,\r\nfrom which proceeds the faculty of vision. By the Greeks it is called\r\nchrystalloides.\r\n\r\n  [HE] κερατοειδὴς.\r\n\r\n  [HF] χοριοειδὴς.\r\n\r\n  [HG] ἀραχνοειδὴς.\r\n\r\n  [HH] ὑαλοειδὴς.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Of a cataract._]\r\n\r\nNow a humour concretes under the twoὑαλοειδὴς. coats, where I mentioned\r\nthe void space to be, either from a disease, or a blow; and being\r\ngradually indurated, it obstructs the interior faculty _of vision_.\r\nThere are several species of this malady, some of which are curable,\r\nand others not. For if the cataract be small, immoveable, of the colour\r\nof sea-water, or burnished iron, and leaves some sense of light on its\r\nsides, there remains hope. If it is large, if the black part of the\r\neye, losing its natural appearance, is changed into some other, if the\r\ncataract be of the colour of wax(11), or gold; if it slides and moves\r\nto and fro, it is scarcely ever cured. And for the most part, the more\r\nsevere the disease, or the greater the pains of the head, or the more\r\nviolent the blow has been, which gave rise to it, so much the worse it\r\nis. Neither is old age a proper time of life for a cure; which without\r\nan additional disease causes a dimness of sight: nor even childhood;\r\nbut the middle age betwixt these. Neither is a very small eye, nor one,\r\nthat is hollow, fit for this operation. And there is also a certain\r\nmaturity of the cataract itself: wherefore we must wait till it seems\r\nto be no longer fluid, but to have concreted with a certain degree of\r\nhardness.\r\n\r\nBefore the operation, the patient must use a spare diet, drink water\r\nfor three days, the day immediately preceding take nothing at all.\r\nAfter this preparation he must be set in a light place, in a seat\r\nfacing the light, and the physician must sit opposite to the patient\r\non a seat a little higher; an assistant behind taking hold of the\r\npatient’s head, and keeping it immoveable; for the sight may be lost\r\nfor ever by a slight motion. Moreover the eye itself, that is to be\r\ncured, must be rendered more fixed by laying wool upon the other, and\r\ntying it on. The operation must be performed on the left eye by the\r\nright hand, and on the right by the left hand. Then the needle sharp\r\npointed(12), but by no means too slender, is to be applied, and must\r\nbe thrust in, but in a straight direction, through the two coats, in\r\nthe middle part betwixt the black of the eye and the external angle\r\nopposite to the middle of the cataract, care being taken to wound\r\nno vein. And it must not be introduced with timidity(13) neither,\r\nbecause it comes into a void space. A person of very moderate skill\r\ncannot but know when it arrives there; for there is no resistance\r\nto the needle: when we reach it, the needle must be turned upon the\r\ncataract, and gently moved up and down there, and by degrees work the\r\ncataract downward below the pupil; when it has past the pupil, it must\r\nbe prest down with a considerable force, that it may settle in the\r\ninferior part. If it remain there, the operation is compleated. If it\r\nrises again, it must be more cut with the same needle, and divided into\r\nseveral pieces; which when separate, are both more easily lodged, and\r\ngive less obstruction. After this the needle must be brought out in a\r\nstraight direction, and the white of an egg spread upon wool must be\r\napplied, and over that something to prevent an inflammation, and then\r\n_the eye_ be bound up.\r\n\r\nAfterwards there is a necessity for rest, abstinence, mild unctuous\r\nmedicines, and food (which it is soon enough to give on the day\r\nfollowing) at first liquid, that the jaws may not be too much employed,\r\nthen when the inflammation is gone, such as was directed in wounds. To\r\nwhich we must add this rule, that the patient’s drink be water for a\r\npretty long time.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Of a flux of gum._]\r\n\r\nI have already treated of a flux of thin gum, which infests the eyes,\r\nso far as the cure depends upon medicines. I now come to these cases,\r\nthat require manual operation. Now we observe that some people’s eyes\r\nnever grow dry, but are always moistened with a thin humour; which\r\ncircumstance occasions a constant asperity, and from slight causes\r\nexcites inflammations, and lippitudes, and in fine renders a person\r\nuneasy all his life. And this disorder in some no remedy can relieve;\r\nin others it is curable. Which difference ought first of all to be\r\nknown, that we may relieve the one, and not meddle with the other.\r\n\r\nAnd in the first place, it is in vain to attempt the operation in\r\nthose, who have this disorder from their infancy, because it will\r\ncertainly continue to their dying day. Secondly, it is needless, where\r\nthe discharge is not great, but acrid; because they are not assisted\r\nby a manual operation, but are brought to a sound state by medicines,\r\nand a proper diet for generating a thicker phlegm. Broad heads also are\r\nhardly susceptible of the remedy. Then it makes a difference whether\r\nthe gum be discharged by the veins, that lye between the skull and the\r\nskin, or by those between the membrane of the brain and the skull:\r\nfor the former moisten the eyes by the temples; the others by the way\r\nof those membranes, that go from the eyes to the brain. Now a remedy\r\nmay be applied to those veins, that discharge above the bone, but not\r\nto those below the bone(14). Neither can relief be given, where the\r\ndischarge comes from both places; because when one part is relieved,\r\nnevertheless the other remains disordered.\r\n\r\nThe source of the disorder is discovered by this method. After shaving\r\nthe head, such medicines, as stop the gum in a lippitude, ought to\r\nbe laid on from the eye-brows as far as the top of the head: if the\r\neyes begin to be dry, it appears that they are moistened by those\r\nveins, which are under the skin: if the moisture is not diminished,\r\nit is manifest it descends from below the bone: if a humour still\r\nflows(15), but in less quantity, the disorder is from both. In most\r\npatients however the complaint is found to be derived from the superior\r\nveins; and therefore the greater number may be relieved. And this is\r\nvery well known, not only in Greece, but amongst other nations too: so\r\nthat no part of medicine has been more clearly explained in any country.\r\n\r\nSome _practitioners_ in Greece cut the skin of the head in nine lines;\r\ntwo straight ones in the occiput, one transverse above these; then two\r\nabove the ears, one also transverse betwixt them; and lastly three\r\nstraight ones between the top of the head and the forehead. Others drew\r\nthese incisions in a straight direction from the top of the head to\r\nthe temples; and discovering from the motion of the jaws the origins\r\nof the muscles, made gentle incisions in the skin above these, and\r\nseparating their lips by means of blunt hooks, they inserted lint in\r\nsuch a manner, as to prevent the edges of the skin from uniting, and to\r\ncause flesh to sprout up in the middle, which might bind those veins,\r\nfrom whence the humour passes to the eyes. Others again have drawn a\r\nline with ink from the middle of one ear to the middle of the other,\r\nand another line from the nose to the crown of the head; and where\r\nthese lines met, made an incision with a knife; and after the effusion\r\nof blood, cauterized the bone in that part. And notwithstanding this,\r\nthey also applied the actual cautery to the rising veins both in the\r\ntemples, and betwixt the forehead and crown of the head.\r\n\r\nIt is a common method of cure to cauterize the veins in the temples,\r\nwhich indeed are generally turgid in this kind of disorder; but that\r\nthey may be more inflated and show themselves better, the neck must\r\nfirst be tied pretty strait. And the veins must be cauterized with\r\nsmall and blunt irons; till the flux of gum upon the eyes stop: for\r\nthat is a sign the passages are blocked up, by which the humour was\r\nconveyed.\r\n\r\nHowever it is a more effectual method, when the veins are small and\r\nlie deep, and therefore cannot be separated(16), to make a ligature\r\nabout the neck in the same manner, and the patient keeping in his\r\nbreath, that the veins may rise the more, to mark with ink these in\r\nthe temples, and between the crown of the head and the forehead;\r\nthen loosing the neck, to cut the veins, where these marks are, and\r\ndischarge blood; when a sufficient quantity has flowed, to cauterize\r\nthem with small irons: in the temples indeed with caution; lest the\r\nmuscles lying below, which secure the jaws, be hurt; but betwixt the\r\nforehead and the crown so strongly, that a scale may cast off from the\r\nbone.\r\n\r\nBut the method of the Africans is still more efficacious, who cauterize\r\nthe crown of the head to the bone, so as to make it cast off a scale.\r\nBut nothing is better than what is done in Gallia Comata, where they\r\nseparate the veins in the temples, and the upper part of the head.\r\nThe manner of treating cauterized parts I have already explained. At\r\npresent I shall add this one direction; that when veins are cauterized,\r\nwe should not endeavour to hasten the separation of the eschars, nor\r\nthe filling up of the ulcers; lest either an hemorrhage ensue, or the\r\npus be quickly suppressed; since it is fit these parts be dried by the\r\nlatter, and it is not proper they should be exhausted by the former. If\r\nhowever an hemorrhage should at any time happen, medicines for stopping\r\nblood must be rubbed in, but not such as will prove caustic. Now the\r\nmethod of separating veins, and what is to be done, when they are\r\nseparated, I shall explain, when I come to the varices of the legs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. VIII.\r\n\r\nOF THE OPERATIONS REQUISITE IN THE EARS.\r\n\r\n\r\nBut as the eyes require many operations, so in the ears there are very\r\nfew disorders, which come under this branch of medicine. However it\r\nsometimes happens, either immediately from the birth, or some time\r\nafter, when there has been an ulceration, and the ear has been filled\r\nby a cicatrix, that there is no opening in it, and there it is deprived\r\nof the faculty of hearing. When this happens, trial must be made with\r\na probe whether it be filled up to any depth, or be only agglutinated\r\nin the surface. For if it be deep, it does not yield to the pressure;\r\nif superficial, it presently receives the probe. The first ought not to\r\nbe touched, lest a convulsion follow without any hopes of success, and\r\nfrom that there may be a danger of death; the other is easily cured.\r\nFor where the foramen ought to be, either some caustic medicine must\r\nbe applied, or it must be opened by the actual cautery, or even cut\r\nwith a knife. And when that is opened, and the ulcer is clean, a quill\r\nmust be introduced there, armed with a cicatrizing medicine; and round\r\nsomething must be applied, to promote the healing of the skin about the\r\nquill; the effect of which is, that after it is removed, the patient\r\nhas the faculty of hearing.\r\n\r\nBut where the ears have been bored and give offence, it is sufficient\r\nto pass a hot needle through the cavity very quick, that its lips may\r\nbe slightly ulcerated; or even to ulcerate it with a caustic medicine;\r\nthen afterwards to apply something to deterge it; next somewhat to\r\nfill up the part, and bring on a cicatrix. But if this opening be\r\nlarge, as it generally is in those who have worn heavy ear-rings, it is\r\nproper to cut through what remains,(17) to its extremity; then above\r\nthat to scarify the edges _of the foramen_ with a knife, and afterwards\r\nto stitch them, and apply an agglutinating medicine. The third case\r\nconsists in giving a supply to any part, that is deficient; which as it\r\nmay also be done in the lips and nose, and the method is the same, it\r\nwill be best to treat of it once for all.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. IX.\r\n\r\nTHE OPERATION NECESSARY IN A WANT OF SUBSTANCE IN THE EARS, LIPS, AND\r\nNOSE.\r\n\r\n\r\nDefects in these three parts, if they be small(18), may be cured: if\r\nconsiderable, they either do not admit of a cure, or by the cure itself\r\nare so deformed, that they were less offensive before. And in the ear\r\nindeed, and the nose, deformity is the only thing to be feared: but in\r\nthe lips, if they are too much contracted, there is also a disadvantage\r\nin respect of their use; because the food is taken, and the speech is\r\narticulated with more difficulty. For flesh is not generated there; but\r\nis brought from the adjacent part. Which though in a slight mutilation\r\nit may both cause no defect, and escape observation, in a great one\r\ncannot. Now an old person is not a proper subject for this operation,\r\nnor one in a bad habit of body, nor one in whom ulcers heal with\r\ndifficulty; because there is no part, where a gangrene more quickly\r\nseizes, or is harder to remove.\r\n\r\nThe method of cure is this; to reduce that, which is mutilated, into a\r\nsquare; from its interior angles to cut in transverse lines, so as to\r\ndivide the part, that lies within these lines, from that beyond them;\r\nthen to draw together the parts we have thus opened: if they do not\r\nfully meet, then beyond the lines we made before, to cut in two places\r\nin a lunated form, with the horns turned towards the wound, so as only\r\nto separate the surface of the skin: for by this means what we draw\r\ntogether will be more at liberty to follow; which is not to be forced\r\nby violence, but gently drawn, so as it may easily follow, and when let\r\ngo, not recede far.\r\n\r\nSometimes however, the skin not being altogether brought from one side,\r\nrenders the part, which it has left, deformed(19). In such a place an\r\nincision must be made only on one side, and the other kept untouched.\r\nTherefore we must not attempt to draw any thing either from the lower\r\npart of the ears, or the middle of the nose, or the lower parts of the\r\nnostrils, or from the angles of the lips. We may draw on both sides,\r\nwhere there is any defect in the upper parts of the ear, or the lower\r\nparts or the middle of the nostrils, or the middle of the lips: which\r\nhowever are sometimes mutilated in two places; but the method of cure\r\nis the same. If a cartilage projects in the part where the incision is\r\nmade, it must be cut off; for it neither unites again, nor is safely\r\npierced by the needle. Neither must much of it be cut away, lest\r\nbetween the two extremities of the skin freed from it on both sides,\r\nthere should be a collection of pus. Then the lips of the wound being\r\nbrought into contact, must be stitched together, the skin being taken\r\nup on both sides; and where the lines above mentioned are, there also\r\nthe suture must be used. In dry parts, as the nostrils, the application\r\nof litharge does very well. Into the interior and lunated incisions\r\nlint must be put; that granulations of flesh may fill up the wound. And\r\nthat the part thus sewed must be attended to with the greatest care,\r\nmay appear from what I said before of a gangrene. Therefore every third\r\nday, it must be fomented with the steam of hot water, and the same\r\nmedicine applied again, which commonly on the seventh day unites it.\r\nThen the stitches ought to be taken out, and the ulcer healed up.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. X.\r\n\r\nOF THE EXTIRPATION OF A POLYPUS IN THE NOSE.\r\n\r\n\r\nI have elsewhere said that the knife is the principal cure for a\r\npolypus growing in the nostrils. Wherefore it is necessary to separate\r\nthis from the bone with a sharp iron instrument made in the form of\r\na spatha: care being taken not to hurt the cartilage below, which is\r\ndifficult to cure. When it is cut off, it must be extracted with an\r\niron hook. Then a piece of lint twisted, or some part of a penecillum\r\nmust be sprinkled with a styptick medicine, and the nostrils be gently\r\nfilled with it. The blood being stopped, the ulcer must be deterged\r\nwith lint. When it is clean, a quill armed with a cicatrizing medicine\r\nmust be introduced within, in the same manner as was directed in the\r\near, till it be entirely sound.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. XI.\r\n\r\nOF THE CHIRURGICAL CURE OF AN OZÆNA.\r\n\r\n\r\nI do not find in the eminent surgeons any operation for the cure of\r\nthat disorder, which the Greeks call ozæna, when it does not yield to\r\nmedicines. I suppose because the operation seldom works a cure, and is\r\nnevertheless attended with great pain. By some however it is directed\r\nto introduce either a small cannula, or writing reed into the nostril,\r\ntill it reach up to the bone; then through this to pass a small hot\r\niron to the very bone; next to deterge the cauterized part with\r\nverdigrease and honey; and when clean, to heal it up with lycium: Or\r\nthat an incision be made in the nostril from its extremity to the bone,\r\nthat the part may be seen, and the hot iron may be more easily applied;\r\nthen that the nostril be stitched; and the cauterized ulcer cured as in\r\nthe former method; and litharge or some other agglutinant laid upon the\r\nsuture.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. XII.\r\n\r\nOF THE OPERATIONS REQUISITE IN THE MOUTH.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Of the teeth._]\r\n\r\nIn the mouth also some disorders are cured by manual operation. Here in\r\nthe first place the teeth are sometimes loosened, either by reason of\r\nthe weakness of their roots, or from the gums decaying. It is proper in\r\nboth cases to apply a hot iron to the gums, so as to touch them gently,\r\nbut not to make a deep impression. The gums when cauterized must be\r\nrubbed with honey, and washed with mulse. When the ulcers begin to be\r\nclean, some dry repellent medicines must be sprinkled upon them.\r\n\r\nBut if a tooth occasions pain, and it seems proper to extract it,\r\nbecause medicines give no relief, it ought to be scraped all round,\r\nthat the gum may be loosened from it; then it is to be shook; which\r\nmust be continued till it move easily: for the extraction of a fast\r\ntooth is attended with the greatest danger, and sometimes the jaw-bone\r\nis dislocated. It is attended with more danger still in the upper\r\nteeth; because it may give a shock to the temples or eyes. After these\r\nprecautions, the tooth is to be taken out, if possible, by the hand, if\r\nnot, by a forceps.\r\n\r\nBut if it be corrupted before, its cavity must be filled up either with\r\nlint, or lead well adapted to it, lest it break under the forceps. The\r\nforceps must be drawn out straight, lest the thin bone, to which the\r\ntooth adheres, be fractured in some part by its bended roots. Neither\r\nis this without danger; especially in the short teeth, which generally\r\nhave longer roots; for often, when the forceps cannot lay hold of the\r\ntooth, or does it without success, it takes hold of the jaw-bone, and\r\nbreaks that.\r\n\r\nOne may immediately be sure, when there is a large effusion of blood,\r\nthat something is broken off from the bone. Therefore the scale,\r\nthat has come off, must be sought for by a probe, and taken out with\r\na vulsella. If it does not come away, the gum ought to be cut, till\r\nthe scale loosened from the bone can be taken out. And if it be not\r\nentirely broken, but the external part of the jaw swells, so that the\r\nmouth cannot open, on the outside must be applied a warm cataplasm of\r\nmeal and figs, till it bring on a suppuration there; then an incision\r\nmust be made in the gum. A copious discharge of pus is also a sign of a\r\nfractured bone: so that even then it is proper to extract it. Sometimes\r\ntoo, when it is injured, there is a fissure, which ought to be scraped.\r\n\r\nA rough tooth ought to be scraped, where it is black, and rubbed with\r\nthe powder of rose leaves, with an addition of one-fourth part of\r\ngalls, and another of myrrh; and pure wine must be held in the mouth\r\nfrequently. And in this case the head must be covered, the patient must\r\nwalk much, make use of friction to his head, and a diet not acrid.\r\n\r\nBut if either, from a blow, or some other misfortune, some of the teeth\r\nare loosened, they must be tied with gold to those that are firm;\r\nand restringents must be held in the mouth, such as wine, in which\r\npomegranate bark has been boiled, or in which hot galls have been\r\ninfused. And if one tooth should happen to grow in children, before the\r\nformer has fallen out, that, which should have dropped, must be scraped\r\nround and pulled out; that which is growing in the place of the former,\r\nmust be pushed into its proper place, with the finger, every day, till\r\nit come to its just size. Whenever a tooth is extracted, and its root\r\nhas been left, that also must be immediately taken out by a forceps\r\nmade for that purpose, which the Greeks call rizagra.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Of indurated tonsils._]\r\n\r\nTonsils, that are indurated, after an inflammation, called antiades[HI]\r\nby the Greeks, when they are covered by a slight coat, should be\r\ndisengaged all round by the finger, and pulled out. If they are not\r\nseparated by this method, it is necessary to take hold of them with a\r\nsmall hook, and cut them out with a knife; then to wash the ulcer with\r\nvinegar, and rub the wound with a styptic medicine.\r\n\r\n  [HI] ἀντιάδες.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Of the uvula._]\r\n\r\nThe uvula, if it is inflamed, and falls down, and is painful, and of a\r\nruddy colour, cannot be cut without danger; for there is commonly a\r\ngreat effusion of blood: therefore it is better to make use of those\r\nremedies I have mentioned elsewhere. But if there be no inflammation,\r\nand nevertheless it is relaxed to a great length by a humour, and is\r\nsmall, sharp, and white, a portion of it ought to be cut off: and\r\nlikewise, if the extremity of it be livid and thick, and the superior\r\npart small. There is no better method than to take hold of it with a\r\nvulsella (_a kind of forceps_), and under that, to cut off what we\r\nthink fit: for there is no danger, that either too much or too little\r\nbe cut off; as we have it in our power to leave no more below the\r\nvulsella, than appears to be useless, and to cut off so much as shall\r\nreduce the uvula to its natural magnitude. After the operation, the\r\nsame applications are proper, which were prescribed above for the\r\ntonsils.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Of the tongue._]\r\n\r\nThe tongue, in some people, is joined with the part below it from their\r\nbirth; who are by that means deprived of speech. The end of their\r\ntongue must be taken hold of with a vulsella, and the membrane below it\r\ncut; great care being taken, that the contiguous veins be not wounded,\r\nand the patient hurt by an effusion of blood. The remaining part of the\r\ncure of the wound is already directed in the preceding cases. And most\r\npeople speak, as soon as it is healed. But I have known an instance,\r\nwhere a person after the cutting of his tongue, though he could thrust\r\nit far enough beyond his teeth, did not attain the faculty of speaking.\r\nThus it happens in the practice of physic, that what is always right to\r\ndo, is not always attended with success.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _An abscess under the tongue._]\r\n\r\nAn abscess also sometimes gathers under the tongue; which is generally\r\nincluded in a coat, and excites violent pains. If this be small, it is\r\nsufficient to make one incision into it: if larger, the surface of the\r\nskin must also be cut off to the coat, then the lips of it are to be\r\nlaid hold of on both sides with small hooks, and the membrane must be\r\nfreed from its connections all round; great care being taken in this\r\noperation not to wound any large vein.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Of chopped lips._]\r\n\r\nThe lips are frequently chopped; which besides the pain, is attended\r\nwith this inconvenience, that it hinders our speaking, as that action\r\nby opening the fissures causes them to bleed, and to give pain. If\r\nthese be only in the surface, it is better to treat them by those\r\nmedicines, which are composed for ulcers of the mouth: if they are\r\ndeeper, it is necessary to cauterize them with a thin iron; which being\r\nmade in the form of a spatha, ought to slide over them as it were, and\r\nnot press upon them. Afterwards, the same method must be followed, as\r\nwas laid down in cauterized ulcers of the nostrils.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. XIII.\r\n\r\nOF THE BRONCHOCELE.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the neck, between the skin and the wind-pipe, a tumour rises,\r\nwhich the Greeks call bronchocele[HJ], in which there is contained\r\nsometimes insensible flesh, at other times a humour like honey or\r\nwater; sometimes also hairs mixed with small bones. Whatever that be,\r\nwhich is contained in the coat, it may be cured by caustic medicines,\r\nwhich burn the surface of the skin, together with the coat below it.\r\nWhen this is done, if it be a humour, it runs out; if it be any thing\r\nsubstantial, it is taken out by the fingers; then the ulcer is healed\r\nby lint. But the cure by the knife is more expeditious. An incision is\r\nmade in one line in the middle of the tumour down to the coat; after\r\nwhich, the morbid body is separated by the finger from the sound parts,\r\nand is taken out entire with its coat: then it is washed with vinegar,\r\nto which either salt or nitre has been added; and the lips are joined\r\nby one stitch. The other applications are the same as in other sutures;\r\nafterwards it must be bound up gently, lest it press the fauces. If\r\nit should happen that the coat cannot be taken out, we must sprinkle\r\nescharotics into it, and dress it with lint and other digestives.\r\n\r\n  [HJ] βρογχοκήλη.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. XIV.\r\n\r\nOF THE OPERATIONS PERFORMED AT THE NAVEL.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are several disorders about the navel, concerning which, because\r\nthey are very uncommon, authors are not agreed. Now it is probable,\r\nthat each one omitted what he had not met with, and that none of them\r\nfeigned a disease he had not seen. An indecent prominence of the navel\r\nis common to them all. The question is, what are its causes? Meges has\r\nassigned three; that sometimes the intestine makes its way into that\r\npart, sometimes the omentum, at other times a humour. Sostratus has\r\nnot mentioned the omentum. To the other two he has added, that flesh\r\nsometimes grows there; which is sometimes sound, at other times of a\r\ncancerous nature. Gorgias also has omitted the omentum, but allowing\r\nthe other three causes, says, that air too sometimes is forced into\r\nthis part. Heron has mentioned all these four, and the omentum too; and\r\nthat species also, in which there is both the omentum and the intestine.\r\n\r\nThe following symptoms discover what species it is. When the intestine\r\nis protruded, the tumour is neither hard nor soft; is lessened by\r\ncold, increases not only by heat, but even by keeping in the breath;\r\nsometimes it sounds; and when a person lies on his back, the intestine\r\nreturns of itself, and the swelling subsides. When it is the omentum,\r\nthe other symptoms are similar, but the tumour is softer, and from its\r\nbase, tapers towards the top; and if one takes hold of it, it slips\r\naway. Where both these are together, the symptoms are also complicated,\r\nand the degree of softness is between both. But flesh is harder, and\r\nthere is a swelling always, though the patient lies on his back; it\r\ndoes not yield to pressure, whereas the former easily does. If it be\r\ncorrupted, it has the same appearances which I described in a cancer.\r\nA humour, if it be pressed, fluctuates. Air gives way to pressure, but\r\nquickly returns; and when the body is in a supine posture, the tumour\r\nretains the same figure.\r\n\r\nOf these species, that which proceeds from air, does not admit of\r\na cure. It is dangerous also to meddle with flesh that resembles a\r\ncancer; and therefore it must be let alone. Where it is sound, it ought\r\nto be cut out, and the wound dressed with lint. Some discharge the\r\nhumour by making an incision in the top of the tumour, and cure that\r\nalso by lint. With regard to the others, the opinions are various.\r\nHowever, the circumstances themselves make it plain, that the body\r\nmust be laid in a supine posture; that whether it be the intestine or\r\nthe omentum, it may fall back into the abdomen. Then the cavity of\r\nthe navel being empty, by some is laid hold of by two regulae(20),\r\nand their ends being tied tight, the part mortifies: by others it is\r\npierced to the bottom with a needle, followed by two threads, and is\r\ntied on the one side and the other by the two ends of each of these\r\nthreads (as is done in the staphyloma of the eye) for by this means\r\nthe part above the ligature mortifies. Others added this process to\r\nthe operation: before tying, they made a single incision on the top,\r\nthat, by introducing a finger, they might push back the protruded\r\npart, and then made the ligature. But it is sufficient to order the\r\npatient to hold in his breath, that the tumour may show itself in its\r\nfull magnitude; then to mark the base of it with ink; and laying the\r\nperson on his back, to press down the tumour, that if any part has\r\nnot returned, it may be forced in by the hand; this done, to draw up\r\nthe navel, and where the mark of the ink is, to tie it strongly with\r\na thread; then to cauterize the part above the ligature, either with\r\nmedicines, or the actual cautery, till it be mortified; and to dress\r\nthe ulcer like other burns. This method is very successful not only\r\nwhen the intestine, or the omentum, or both are contained in it, but\r\neven where it is a tumour.\r\n\r\nBut some circumstances are to be considered, before proceeding to the\r\noperation, that no danger may arise from the ligature. For neither\r\nan infant, nor an adult, nor an old man are proper subjects for this\r\nmethod of cure; but generally such as are from seven to fourteen\r\nyears old. Next, that person is in a fit condition for it, whose body\r\nis sound; but one, who is in a bad habit, and labours under papulæ,\r\nimpetigoes, and the like disorders, is not a proper subject. Slight\r\ntumours also are easily removed; but there is danger in attempting\r\nto cure those that are too large. The autumnal and winter season of\r\nthe year must be avoided. Spring is most suitable: and the beginning\r\nof summer is not amiss. Besides these precautions, it is necessary to\r\nfast the day before. Nor is that sufficient; for a clyster must also be\r\ngiven, that all the protruded parts may the more easily subside within\r\nthe abdomen.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. XV.\r\n\r\nTHE METHOD OF DISCHARGING THE WATER IN HYDROPICK PEOPLE.\r\n\r\n\r\nI have elsewhere observed, that it is necessary to discharge the water\r\nin dropsical patients. I must now describe the manner of performing it.\r\nSome do it below the navel, about four fingers breadth to the left:\r\nsome by perforating the navel itself. Others first cauterize the skin,\r\nand then make an incision through the interior teguments, because what\r\nis divided by the actual cautery unites less quickly. The instrument\r\nis to be introduced with great care not to wound any vein. It ought to\r\nbe of such a form, that the breadth of its point should be about the\r\nthird part of a finger; and it must be introduced so as to pass through\r\nthe membrane also, which separates the flesh from the internal part;\r\nthen a leaden or copper pipe must be introduced into it, its lips being\r\neither spread outward, or surrounded with some check to prevent its\r\nslipping through. The part that goes within ought to be a little longer\r\nthan that without, that it may reach beyond the internal membrane. By\r\nthis the water must be evacuated, and when the greater part of it is\r\ndischarged, the pipe must be stopped with a bit of linen, and left in\r\nthe wound, if it was not cauterized. Then on the following days, about\r\na hemina must be let out every day, till no water appears to remain.\r\nSome even take out the pipe, though the skin has not been cauterized,\r\nand tie over the wound a spunge squeezed out of cold water, or vinegar,\r\nand the day following introduce the pipe again (which the recent wound,\r\nby being a little stretched open, will admit of) that so, if any\r\nhumour remains, it may be evacuated; and this they recommend to be done\r\nonly twice.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. XVI.\r\n\r\nOF WOUNDS OF THE BELLY AND INTESTINES.\r\n\r\n\r\nSometimes the belly is perforated by a wound; upon which the intestines\r\nroll out. When this happens, it must be first of all considered,\r\nwhether they be unhurt; and then whether they retain their natural\r\ncolour. If the smaller intestine be perforated, I have already\r\nobserved, that there is no cure for it. The large intestine may be\r\nsewed; not that there is any reliance on the cure, but because a\r\ndoubtful hope is preferable to certain despair: for it sometimes\r\nreunites. However, if either the intestine be livid, or pale, or black,\r\nwhich symptoms also are necessarily attended with a want of sensation,\r\nall remedies are vain. But if they yet retain their proper colour,\r\nthey must be treated with great expedition; for they are changed in\r\na moment, when exposed to the external air, to which they are not\r\naccustomed. The patient must be laid on his back, with his hips raised\r\npretty high; and if the wound be so narrow, that the intestines cannot\r\nbe conveniently reduced, a sufficient opening must be made by incision.\r\nAnd if the intestines are already become too dry, they must be washed\r\nwith water mixed with a little oil. Then the assistant ought gently to\r\nseparate the lips of the wound with his hands, or even with two hooks\r\npassed through the peritonaeum, and the physician must insert those\r\nintestines first that came out last, in such a manner as to preserve\r\nthe order of their several convolutions. When they are all replaced,\r\nthe patient must be shook gently, which causes all the intestines to\r\nreturn to their proper places, and settle there. These being lodged,\r\nthe omentum must also be considered; and if any part of that be already\r\nblack or mortified, it must be cut off by the scissars; if any of it is\r\nsound, it must be reduced upon the intestines. Now, neither a suture of\r\nthe skin alone, nor of the interior membrane is sufficient, but both of\r\nthem together. And that must be performed with two threads, and sewed\r\ncloser than in other places; because it may both be more easily broken\r\nby the motion of the belly, and this part is not so liable to violent\r\ninflammations. Therefore, threads are to be put into two needles, and\r\nthese held in both hands; the interior membrane must be sewed first,\r\nbeginning at the extremity of the wound, in such a manner, that the\r\nneedle may pass from the internal towards the external part, the left\r\nhand carrying it through the right lip, and the right hand through the\r\nleft, by which means, the points of the needles are always farthest\r\nfrom the intestines, and the blunt part next to them. When each side\r\nis pierced once, the needles must be changed in the hands, that the\r\nneedle, which was in the left hand, may be in the right, and that come\r\ninto the left, which the right held before: and in the same manner they\r\nmust pass through the lips again; and also a third and fourth time,\r\nand so on, the hands each time interchanging the needles, and thus the\r\nwound must be closed. Then the same threads and needles must be brought\r\nto the skin, and in like manner both sutures be performed on that part\r\ntoo; the needles always passing from the internal part, and from the\r\none hand to the other. Afterwards agglutinants must be applied: to\r\nwhich it is needless to repeat, from time to time, that it is necessary\r\nto add either spunge or sordid wool squeezed out of vinegar. When these\r\nare applied, a gentle bandage ought to be passed round the belly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. XVII.\r\n\r\nOF A RUPTURE OF THE PERITONAEUM.\r\n\r\n\r\nSometimes either from a blow, or keeping in the breath too long, or\r\nby the pressure of a heavy load, the internal membrane of the abdomen\r\nbreaks, when the skin above is whole: which also frequently happens\r\nto women from pregnancy; and it generally occurs about the ilia. The\r\nconsequence is, that the flesh above being soft, does not bind the\r\nintestines strongly enough, and the skin distended by them forms an\r\nindecent tumour. And this disease is cured in different ways. For some\r\npassing a needle with two threads into the base _of the tumour_, tie\r\nit on both sides in the same manner described in the cases of the\r\nnavel and the staphyloma, that whatever is above the ligature may\r\nmortify. Others cut out the middle of it in the form of a myrtle leaf\r\n(according to the rule before laid down for all cases of a like nature)\r\nand then join the lips by a suture. However, the best method is to\r\nlay the patient on his back, and try by the hand, in what part the\r\ntumour yields most, because the membrane must necessarily be ruptured\r\nthere, and resist more, where it is sound: then, where it appears to be\r\nruptured, incisions are to be made in two lines(21) by a knife, that\r\nthe part betwixt them being cut out, the internal membrane may have a\r\nrecent wound on both sides; because what has been long disunited does\r\nnot unite by a suture. The place being laid open, if the membrane in\r\nany part should appear not to be fresh wounded, a small slip must be\r\ncut off, only to ulcerate its edges. What else relates to the suture,\r\nand the remaining part of the cure, has been above directed.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Of varices in the belly._]\r\n\r\nBesides these, some people have varices in their bellies; but as the\r\nmethod of cure here does not differ from that which is practised in the\r\nlegs, and being about to describe it by and by, I shall refer it to\r\nthat place.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. XVIII.\r\n\r\nA DESCRIPTION OF THE TESTICLES, AND THEIR DISEASES.\r\n\r\n\r\nI now come to those diseases which arise in the private parts about the\r\ntesticles: which, that I may the more easily explain, I shall first\r\ngive a short account of the nature of the part. The testicles then have\r\nsomething resembling small glands(22): for they do not discharge\r\nblood, and are void of all sensation; the coats, however(23), which\r\ncontain them, are pained in wounds and inflammations. Now each of them\r\nhangs from the groin by a nerve (_the vas deferens_) which the Greeks\r\ncall cremaster[HK]: and with each descends both a vein and an artery.\r\nAnd these are covered with a membrane, thin, nervous, not sanguineous,\r\nand white, which by the Greeks is called elytroides[HL]. Over that is a\r\nfirmer coat, which adheres strongly in the lowest part to the interior\r\none. The Greeks call it dartos[HM]. Besides, there are many small\r\nmembranes, which inclose the veins and arteries, and those nerves; and\r\nbetwixt the two coats in the superior part they are thin and open. Thus\r\nfar then the coats and vessels are peculiar to each testicle. But there\r\nis a sinus common to both, and to all the internal part, which is also\r\nexposed to our view. The Greeks call it oscheum[HN]; in our language it\r\nis scrotum. And this in the lower part is slightly connected with the\r\nmiddle coats, above only envelopes them.\r\n\r\n  [HK] κρεμαστὴρ.\r\n\r\n  [HL] λυτροειδὴς.\r\n\r\n  [HM] δαρτὸς.\r\n\r\n  [HN] ὀσχεὸν.\r\n\r\nUnder this then several disorders occur: which happen sometimes\r\nwhen these coats, which I said had their origin from the groin, are\r\nruptured; at other times, when they are entire: for sometimes the coat,\r\nwhich ought to separate the intestines from the inferior parts, is\r\neither first inflamed from a distemper, and afterwards burst by the\r\nweight, or ruptured at once by some wound. Then either the omentum\r\nalone, or that and the intestine together, fall down into it by their\r\nown weight. And finding a way there, they bear down gradually from the\r\ngroin upon the inferior parts, and by and by divide the nervous coats,\r\nwhich, for the reason I gave before, are open. The Greeks call these\r\nenterocele[HO] and epiplocele[HP]: with us an indecent, but common name\r\nfor them is hernia.\r\n\r\n  [HO] ἐντεροκήλη.\r\n\r\n  [HP] ἐπιπλοκήλη.\r\n\r\nNow if the omentum descends, the tumour in the scrotum is never removed\r\neither by fasting, turning the body one way or another, or placing it\r\nin any particular posture; and if the breath be kept in, it is not much\r\nincreased, is unequal to the touch, and soft and slippery.\r\n\r\nBut if the intestine also descends, the tumour without any inflammation\r\nsometimes lessens, at other times increases, and it is generally free\r\nfrom pain, and when a person is at rest, or lies down, it sometimes\r\nentirely subsides, at other times it is so diminished, that a very\r\nsmall part of it remains in the scrotum; but upon vociferation, or\r\nrepletion, and a violent exertion of force in bearing a great weight,\r\nit increases: by cold it is contracted, by heat dilated; and at that\r\ntime the scrotum is both round and smooth to the touch, and what lies\r\nwithin is slippery; if it be pressed, it returns to the groin; and\r\nbeing let go, it rolls down again with a murmuring kind of noise, and\r\nthis happens in the lesser degrees of this malady. But sometimes from\r\nthe reception of excrements, the swelling is vastly enlarged, and\r\ncannot be reduced; and occasions pain at such times to the scrotum and\r\ngroin, and abdomen. Sometimes too the stomach is affected, and throws\r\nup first reddish coloured bile, then green, and in some even black.\r\n\r\nSometimes the membranes being entire, a fluid distends this part: and\r\nthere are also two species of this. For it either collects between the\r\ncoats, or in the membranes, which surround the veins and arteries in\r\nthat part, when they are oppressed, and have grown callous. Neither\r\nhas that fluid betwixt the coats one certain seat: for sometimes\r\nit lodges between the external and middle, sometimes betwixt the\r\nmiddle and internal coat. The Greeks call this by the general name of\r\nhydrocele[HQ], of whatever species it be. Our countrymen, not being\r\nacquainted with any distinctions, include this also under the same name\r\nas the former disorders.\r\n\r\n  [HQ] ὑδροκήλη.\r\n\r\nNow in these there are some symptoms, that belong to all, and others,\r\nthat are peculiar to each particular species. The general are such as\r\nindicate the collection of a fluid; the particular, its seat. We know a\r\nfluid is contained within, if there be a tumour, that never disappears\r\nentirely, but is sometimes lessened by fasting, or a slight fever, and\r\nchiefly in children. And this is soft, if there is not a very great\r\nquantity of fluid within; but if it has greatly increased, it resists\r\nlike a bottle filled, and tightly tied; the veins in the scrotum also\r\nare inflated; if we press upon it with our finger, the fluid yields,\r\nand fluctuating raises the part that is not pressed; and it appears\r\nthrough the scrotum, as if it were in a glass or a horn; and in itself\r\nis attended with no pain. The seat of it is thus known: If the water be\r\nbetwixt the external and middle coat, when we press with two fingers,\r\nit gradually returns between them; the scrotum is somewhat lax and\r\nwhitish; if it is stroked, it stretches little or nothing; the testicle\r\ncan neither be seen nor felt in that part. But if it is within the\r\nmiddle coat, the scrotum is more stretched and raised higher, so that\r\nthe penis above it is concealed under the swelling.\r\n\r\nBesides these, when the coats are equally entire, a ramex grows there.\r\nThe Greeks call it cirsocele[HR], when the veins swell. These being\r\nsometimes twisted, and rolled up toward the superior part, fill either\r\nthe scrotum, or the middle coat, or the innermost one; sometimes they\r\ngrow even within the innermost coat about the testicle itself and its\r\nnerve. Those that are in the scrotum itself are exposed to view; and\r\nthose which lie upon the middle or innermost coat, as being deeper, are\r\nnot indeed equally discernible, but yet are visible; besides that there\r\nis both some swelling, according to the size and capacity of the veins,\r\nand it also resists pressure more, and is unequal by reason of the\r\nvaricous dilatations of the veins; and on that side where it is, the\r\ntesticle is more dependent than it should be. But when this malady has\r\ngrown upon the testicle itself and its nerve, the testicle hangs down\r\nmuch lower, and becomes less than the other, as being deprived of its\r\nnutriment.\r\n\r\n  [HR] κιρσοκήλη.\r\n\r\nSometimes, though seldom, flesh grows between the coats. The Greeks\r\ncall that sarcocele[HS].\r\n\r\n  [HS] σαρκοκήλη.\r\n\r\nSometimes too the testicle itself swells from an inflammation, and\r\nalso brings on fevers; and unless the inflammation has quickly ceased,\r\nthe pain reaches to the groin and ilia; and these parts swell, and the\r\nnerve, by which the testicle hangs, is enlarged, and grows hard at the\r\nsame time.\r\n\r\nBesides the foregoing, the groin is also sometimes filled with ramices;\r\nwhich case they call bubonocele[HT].\r\n\r\n  [HT] βουβωνοκήλη.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. XIX.\r\n\r\nGENERAL DIRECTIONS FOR OPERATIONS IN THE FOREGOING DISEASES ABOUT THE\r\nTESTICLES.\r\n\r\n\r\nThese disorders being known, we must proceed to treat of their cure: in\r\nwhich some things are common to them all, some proper to the particular\r\nkinds. I shall first speak of the general: and now treat of those,\r\nwhich require the knife. For those, that are either incurable, or ought\r\nto be treated in a different manner, I shall take notice of, when I\r\ncome to the particular species. Now the incision is made sometimes in\r\nthe groin, sometimes in the scrotum. In either method it is necessary\r\nfor the patient to drink water for three days before; and the preceding\r\nday even to fast: on the day of the operation, he must be laid on his\r\nback; and if the incision is to be in the groin, and that is covered\r\nwith hair, it must first be shaved; then the scrotum being extended to\r\nrender the skin tense, the incision must be made at the bottom of the\r\nbelly, where the inferior coats are joined to the abdomen. It must be\r\nopened boldly, till the external coat, which is the scrotum itself, be\r\ncut, and the middle one come in view. When the wound is made, there\r\nis an opening toward the inferior parts. Into that the fore finger of\r\nthe left hand must be introduced, that by separating the intervening\r\nmembranes it may enlarge the sinus. And an assistant taking hold of the\r\nscrotum with his left hand, must extend it upward, drawing it away as\r\nmuch as possible from the groin; at first with the testicle, while the\r\nphysician cuts away by the knife, if he cannot separate them by his\r\nfinger, all the small membranes, that are above the middle coat; after\r\nthis, letting go the testicle, that it may slip down, and come near to\r\nthe wound, and be brought out thence by the finger, and laid upon the\r\nbelly with its two coats. And if any part of it is corrupted, it must\r\nbe cut off. And as several veins are dispersed upon it, the small ones\r\nmay be cut at once, but the larger should be first tied with a pretty\r\nlong thread, to prevent a dangerous hemorrhage from them.\r\n\r\nBut if the middle coat be affected, or the disease lies below it, it\r\nmust be cut out in such manner, that in the higher part close to the\r\ngroin it should be clean cut off: but the whole must not be taken away\r\nbelow; for what is strongly connected at the base of the testicle with\r\nthe innermost coat, cannot be cut off without the greatest danger, and\r\nfor that reason must be left there.\r\n\r\nThe same method is to be taken in the innermost coat too, if that be\r\ninjured. But it must be cut off, not at the top of the wound in the\r\ngroin, but a little below that; lest it bring on inflammations by\r\nwounding the membrane of the abdomen. Neither on the contrary must\r\ntoo much of it be left; lest afterwards it form a sinus, and afford a\r\nreceptacle to the same distemper.\r\n\r\nThe testicle being thus cleansed must be gently let down through the\r\nwound, with the veins, and arteries and its nerve; and care must be\r\ntaken, that no blood fall into the scrotum, and that it does not remain\r\ncoagulated in any part: which will be prevented, if the physician has\r\nbeen careful to tie the veins. The threads, by which their ends are\r\nsecured, must hang without the wound: and when a suppuration comes on,\r\nthey will fall off without any pain. Upon the wound itself must be put\r\ntwo fibulæ; and over them an agglutinating medicine.\r\n\r\nIt is sometimes necessary to cut off something from one of the lips,\r\nthat the cicatrix may be larger and broader. When this is the case,\r\nthe lint must not be pressed down upon it, but only laid on lightly;\r\nand over it some medicines to repel an inflammation, such as sordid\r\nwool, or spunge squeezed out of vinegar; every thing else must be used\r\nas when a suppuration ought to be excited. But when it is necessary\r\nto make the incision beneath, the patient being laid on his back, the\r\nleft hand must be put below the scrotum; and a strong hold must be\r\ntaken of it, and the incision made; if the seat of the disorder be\r\nsmall, the incision must be moderately sized, so as to leave a third\r\npart _of the scrotum_ below entire, in order to support the testicle;\r\nif it be larger, the wound may be greater, a little at the bottom\r\nonly being left entire, upon which the testicle may rest. But the\r\nknife at first should be held in a straight direction, with a very\r\nlight hand, till it divide the scrotum itself; then the point of it\r\nmust be turned aside a little, to cut the transverse membranes, that\r\nare between the external and middle coats. But the middle coat ought\r\nnot to be touched, if the disease lie above it; but if it lies below\r\nthe middle coat, that must be cut too; as likewise the third, if that\r\ncover the malady. Wherever the disorder is found, the assistant should\r\nsqueeze the scrotum gently at the lower part; and the physician having\r\nseparated the inferior part by his finger, or the handle of the knife,\r\nshould bring the coat out of the wound, and make such an incision with\r\nan instrument, which from its figure is called corvus, that he may\r\nintroduce his fore and middle fingers: when this is done, the remaining\r\npart of the coat must be cut, and the knife must pass between the\r\ntwo fingers, and whatever is noxious must either be taken out, or be\r\nallowed to run out.\r\n\r\nWhatever coat is injured in the operation must be cut off; and the\r\nmiddle one, as I observed before, as high as possible at the groin; the\r\ninnermost one a little lower. But before they are cut off, the vessels\r\nought to be tied very carefully by a thread; and the ends of this\r\nthread must be left without the wound, which must be done also in other\r\nveins, where the ligature is requisite.\r\n\r\nWhen that is done, the testicle must be returned into its place: and\r\nthe lips of the scrotum joined together by a suture: and the stitches\r\nmust not be too few, lest they be not agglutinated, and the cure prove\r\ntedious; nor yet too many, lest they increase the inflammation. And in\r\nthis case too we must be cautious, that no blood remain in the scrotum:\r\nafterwards agglutinants must be applied.\r\n\r\nIf however blood has made its way into the scrotum, or any coagulated\r\nblood has fallen down into it, an incision should be made below it;\r\nand after cleansing it, a spunge moistened with sharp vinegar must be\r\napplied round it. A wound that has been made for these reasons, after\r\nit is tied up, if there be no pain, must not be opened for the first\r\nfive days; but either the wool or spunge, that lies over it, must be\r\nsprinkled twice a day with vinegar alone; if there be pain, it must\r\nbe opened on the third day; and where there are fibulæ, they must be\r\ncut; and where lint, that must be changed; and what is put on, must be\r\nwet with oil of roses and wine. If the inflammation increases, to the\r\nforegoing applications must be added a cataplasm of lentils and honey,\r\nof pomegranate bark boiled in a rough wine, or a mixture of these.\r\nIf the inflammation does not give way to them, after the fifth day,\r\nthe wound must be fomented with plenty of hot water, till the scrotum\r\nitself be both extenuated, and become more wrinkled; then a cataplasm\r\nmust be applied of wheat meal, with an addition of pine resin; which,\r\nif the patient be a robust man, must be boiled up with vinegar; if more\r\ndelicate, with honey. And whatever the disorder has been, if there be\r\na great inflammation, without doubt medicines to promote a suppuration\r\nmust be applied.\r\n\r\nBut if pus is generated within the scrotum, a small incision ought to\r\nbe made to give a vent; and so much lint is to be applied as to cover\r\nthe orifice. When the inflammation is removed, upon account of the\r\nnerves, the last-mentioned cataplasm, and then cerate must be used.\r\nThis is the peculiar treatment of wounds of this kind. All other things\r\nboth in regard to the manner of dressing, and the diet, should be\r\nconformable to the directions we have given about other wounds.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. XX.\r\n\r\nOF THE CURE OF A RUPTURE OF THE INTESTINE INTO THE SCROTUM.\r\n\r\n\r\nThese things being premised, we must descend to the particular species.\r\nAnd if the intestine comes down in a young child, a bandage must be\r\nmade trial of before the knife: for this purpose a roller is sewed, to\r\nwhich in one part a bolster is used made of cloths, which is applied\r\nunder the intestine to repel it; and then the rest of the roller is\r\nbound tight about him: by means of which, the intestine is often forced\r\nin, and the coats are agglutinated together. Again if the patient be\r\nadvanced in years, and from the largeness of the tumour it appears,\r\nthat much of the intestine has fallen down, and the case is attended\r\nwith pains and vomiting (which generally proceeds from the excrements\r\ngetting down into that part by a crudity) it is plain that the knife\r\ncannot be used without fatal consequences; the complaint is therefore\r\nonly to be alleviated; and the intestine evacuated by other methods.\r\n\r\nThe patient ought to be bled in the arm: and then if his strength will\r\nadmit, abstinence must be enjoined for three days; if he cannot bear\r\nthat, at least as long as his strength will allow. At the same time\r\nmust be kept upon it a cataplasm of lintseed boiled in mulse. After\r\nthese both barley meal with resin must be applied, and the patient put\r\ninto a bath of warm water mixed with oil; and some light and hot food\r\nmust be given. Some even administer clysters. These may carry something\r\ninto the scrotum, but cannot evacuate any thing from thence. The\r\ndisease being mitigated by the methods above prescribed, if the pain\r\nreturns at any time, the same course must be pursued.\r\n\r\nIf a great portion of the intestine has fallen down without pain, it is\r\nalso needless to make an incision; not but that it may be removed from\r\nthe scrotum (unless an inflammation prevent) but because when repelled\r\nthence, it stops at the groin, and raises a tumour there; and thus\r\nthere is not a termination, but a change of the malady.\r\n\r\nBut where the use of the knife is proper, as soon as the wound made in\r\nthe groin shall reach to the second coat, that must be taken hold of\r\nnear the lips with two small hooks, while the physician disengages it\r\nby taking out all the small membranes: for that, which is to be cut,\r\ncannot be injured without danger, as the intestine must lie below it.\r\nWhen it shall be separated, an incision must be made from the groin to\r\nthe testicle, care being taken not to wound the last; then it must be\r\ncut out. For the most part however this operation is _only_ practicable\r\nin children, and in a moderate degree of the malady.\r\n\r\nBut if it be a robust man, and the disorder be more considerable, the\r\ntesticle ought not to be taken out, but to remain in its place. The\r\noperation is performed in this manner. The groin is opened in the\r\nsame way by a knife, as far as the middle coat; and this coat in like\r\nmanner is taken hold of with two hooks, and the testicle is held by an\r\nassistant(24), so as to prevent its coming out at the wound; then an\r\nincision must be made downward in this coat with a knife; and below\r\nit the fore finger of the left hand is introduced to the bottom of the\r\ntesticle, which it forces up to the wound: then the thumb and fore\r\nfinger of the right hand separate the vein and artery, and their nerve,\r\nand coat from the external coat. And if any small membranes obstruct\r\nthis, they are divided by the knife, till the coat be wholly exposed to\r\nview. When all is cut out, that requires excision, and the testicle is\r\nreplaced, a pretty broad habenula is to be taken from the lip of the\r\nwound in the groin, that the wound may be the larger, and generate the\r\nmore flesh.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. XXI.\r\n\r\nOF THE CURE OF A RUPTURE OF THE OMENTUM INTO THE SCROTUM.\r\n\r\n\r\nBut if the omentum descends, the groin must be opened, and the coats\r\nseparated in the same manner as directed before. And it must be\r\nconsidered whether it be a large or small part of it. For when it is\r\nvery small, it must be forced back over the groin into the abdomen by\r\na finger or the broad end of a probe: if it is large, whatever has\r\nfallen out of the abdomen must be allowed to remain there; and it must\r\nhave escharotic medicines laid on it, till it mortify and fall off.\r\nSome in this case pass through it a needle with two threads, and tie\r\nthe two ends of each contrary ways; by which it mortifies with equal\r\ncertainty, but not so soon. The effect is accomplished sooner, if the\r\npart of the omentum above the ligature be rubbed with eating medicines,\r\nbut not corrosive; they are called septica by the Greeks. There have\r\nbeen others, who have cut off the omentum with scissars: which is not\r\nnecessary, where the quantity is small; and if large, it may occasion\r\nan hemorrhage; for the omentum is also connected by veins, and some of\r\nthem large. Neither can this practice be justified by an example drawn\r\nfrom the cases of the belly opened by a wound, where the part of the\r\nomentum, which falls out, is cut away by the scissars: since in this\r\ncase, it is both mortified, and cannot be taken off in any other way\r\nmore safely. If the omentum be reduced, the wound ought to be stitched;\r\nor if it has been large and has mortified externally, the lips must be\r\ncut off, as proposed before.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Of a hydrocele._]\r\n\r\nIf there be a fluid within _the membranes_, an incision must be made,\r\nin boys upon the groin, unless too large a quantity of fluid forbid the\r\noperation in that place; but in men, and where-ever there is a large\r\nquantity, the scrotum must be opened. Then if the incision be made in\r\nthe groin, the coats must be drawn out at that part, and the humour\r\nevacuated; if at the scrotum, and the disease be immediately below that\r\ncoat, there is no more required but to evacuate the humour, and cut\r\naway any of the membranes, that happen to contain it; then it must be\r\nwashed with water, and an addition either of salt, or nitre: if the\r\ndisease lie within the middle or innermost coat, they must be taken\r\nentirely out of the scrotum and cut off.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. XXII.\r\n\r\nOF A RAMEX IN THE SCROTUM.\r\n\r\n\r\nA ramex situated upon the scrotum must be cauterized with small and\r\nsharp irons run into the veins themselves, provided they burn nothing\r\nelse: it is peculiarly necessary to apply the cautery where they are\r\ntwisted and rolled together; afterwards meal mixed up with cold water\r\nmust be laid on; and the bandage must be applied, which I recommended\r\nfor the anus; on the third day lentils with honey must be put to it:\r\nafter the separation of the eschars, the ulcers must be deterged with\r\nhoney, embrocated with rose oil, and brought to cicatrize by dry lint.\r\nWhere the veins above the middle coat swell, the groin must be cut, and\r\nthe coat brought without the orifice; after which the veins are to be\r\nseparated from it by the finger, or the handle of the knife, and where\r\nthey adhere, tied both above and below by a thread; then they must be\r\ncut through close to the ligatures, and the testicle replaced. But if\r\nthe ramex be situated upon the innermost coat, it is necessary to cut\r\nout the middle one. And then if two or three veins swell, so that some\r\npart be affected, but the greater part be from the disease, the same\r\nmethod must be pursued as directed above; that is, the veins being\r\ntied both at the groin and testicle, may be cut off, and the testicle\r\nreduced to its place. But if the ramex have seized upon the whole of\r\nit, the fore finger must be introduced through the wound, and put under\r\nthe veins, so as to draw them out gradually and uniformly, till the one\r\ntesticle be equal to the other; then fibulæ are to be put in the lips\r\nin such a manner, as to lay hold of these veins likewise. It is done\r\nthus. A needle passes through the lip from the external part, and then\r\nis directed not through the vein itself, but its membrane, and from\r\nthence is forced into the other lip. The veins ought not to be wounded,\r\nlest they discharge blood. There is always a membrane between these\r\nveins, which occasions no danger, and holds them fast enough, when\r\ntaken up by the thread: and therefore two fibulæ are sufficient. After\r\nthis, whatever veins have been brought out, should be returned into the\r\ngroin with the broad end of the probe. The time for loosing the fibulæ\r\nis, when the inflammation is gone, and the ulcer deterged; that the\r\ncicatrix may at once bind up both the lips and the veins.\r\n\r\nWhen the ramex has grown between the innermost coat, and the testicle\r\nitself and its nerve, the only cure is to cut off the whole testicle:\r\nfor it does not in the least contribute to generation, and hangs down\r\nin all indecently, in some even with pain. But in this case too, an\r\nincision is to be made in the groin, and the middle coat must be drawn\r\nout and cut away; the innermost one is to be treated in the same\r\nmanner; and the nerve, by which the testicle depends, to be cut off.\r\nAfter this, the veins and arteries must be tied by a thread at the\r\ngroin, and cut off below the ligature.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. XXIII.\r\n\r\nOF A SARCOCELE.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf flesh happen to grow between the coats, it must certainly be taken\r\nout; and the most convenient way of doing it is by an incision in the\r\nscrotum.\r\n\r\nBut if the nerve be indurated, the disorder cannot be cured either\r\nby the hand or medicines. For the patients are oppressed with ardent\r\nfevers, and either green, or black vomitings, besides these a violent\r\nthirst, and roughness of the tongue; and generally about the third\r\nday, frothy bile is discharged by stool, which excoriates the parts;\r\nand food can neither be easily taken or retained; not long after,\r\nthe extremities grow cold, a tumour comes on, the hands are expanded\r\ninvoluntarily; then comes on a cold sweat in the forehead, which is\r\nfollowed by death.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. XXIV.\r\n\r\nOF A RAMEX IN THE GROIN.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen there is a ramex in the groin, if the swelling be small, a single\r\nincision ought to be made; if it be larger, it ought to be done in two\r\nlines, that what lies between may be cut out; and then without taking\r\naway the testicle, as I have above shewn to be sometimes practised in a\r\nrupture of the intestines, the veins must be taken up, and tied, where\r\nthey adhere to the coats, and cut off below these knots. The cure of\r\nthis wound is no way different from others.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. XXV.\r\n\r\nTHE OPERATIONS REQUISITE IN THE DISORDERS OF THE PENIS.\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom those we are to proceed to the operations upon the penis. If the\r\nglans be bare, and a person chuses for the sake of decency to have\r\nit covered, that may be done; but more easily in a boy than a man;\r\nand more easily in one, to whom it is natural, than in another, who\r\naccording to the custom of some nations has been circumcised; better\r\nwhere the glans is small, and the skin about it pretty large, and the\r\npenis itself short, than where there is quite the reverse of these\r\ncircumstances. The cure of these, in whom it is natural, is performed\r\nin this manner. The skin about the glans is laid hold of, and extended\r\ntill it cover it, and tied there; then near the pubes a circular\r\nincision is made on the skin of the penis, till it be laid bare; and\r\ngreat caution is used not to cut either the urinary pipe, or the\r\nveins in that part. When this is done, the skin is drawn towards the\r\nligature, so that a part near the pubes is laid bare resembling a hoop;\r\nthen over it is applied lint, that the flesh may grow and fill it up,\r\nand the breadth of the wound may afford a sufficient covering to the\r\nglans. But the ligature must be continued till a cicatrix be formed,\r\nleaving only in the middle a small passage for the urine. But in a\r\nperson, that has been circumcised, under the circle of the glans, the\r\nskin ought to be separated by a knife from the inner part of the penis.\r\nThis is not very painful, because the extremity being loosened, it may\r\nbe drawn backwards by the hand, as far as the pubes; and no hemorrhage\r\nfollows upon it. The skin being disengaged, is extended again over the\r\nglans; then it is bathed with plenty of cold water, and a plaister put\r\nround it of efficacy in repelling an inflammation. For the following\r\ndays the patient is to fast, till he be almost overcome with hunger,\r\nlest a full diet should perhaps cause an erection of that part. When\r\nthe inflammation is gone, it ought to be bound up from the pubercles to\r\nthe circle of the glans; and a plaister being first laid on the glans,\r\nthe skin ought to be brought over it; for thus it will happen, that the\r\ninferior part may be united, and the superior heal so as not to adhere.\r\n\r\nOn the contrary, if the glans be covered, so that it cannot be denuded\r\n(which malady the Greeks call phymosis) it must be opened: which is\r\ndone in this manner. An incision is made in the prepuce below its\r\nextremity, in a right line to the frænum; and the upper part being\r\nthus relaxed, may be drawn back. But if this be not effectual, either\r\nupon account of the straitness or hardness of the prepuce, a piece of\r\nskin must be immediately cut out in the lower part in the form of a\r\ntriangle, with its vertex at the frænum, and the base at the extremity\r\nof the prepuce. Then lint is to be applied over it, and other medicines\r\nto heal it. And it is necessary to continue at rest till it be\r\ncicatrized; for walking, by the attrition it causes, renders the ulcer\r\nfoul.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Of infibulating boys._]\r\n\r\nSome have made a practice of infibulating boys, sometimes upon account\r\nof their health(25): the method of doing it is this. The skin that\r\ncovers the glans is extended, and marked on both sides with ink, where\r\nit may be perforated, and then is let go. If these marks return upon\r\nthe glans, too much has been taken up, and it ought to be marked nearer\r\nthe extremity: if the glans is not reached by them, that part is proper\r\nfor the fibula. Then where the marks are, the skin is pierced by a\r\nneedle followed by a thread, and the two ends of this thread are tied\r\ntogether, and moved every day, till small cicatrices be formed about\r\nthe orifice. When these are confirmed, the thread is taken out, and a\r\nfibula put in, which, the lighter it is, is so much the better. But\r\nthis operation however is more frequently needless than necessary.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. XXVI.\r\n\r\nOF THE OPERATION NECESSARY IN A SUPPRESSION OF URINE, AND LITHOTOMY.\r\n\r\n\r\nSometimes when no urine is made, an operation is necessary to discharge\r\nit, either because the passage is collapsed from old age, or because a\r\nstone, or some other concretion from blood has obstructed it within;\r\nand a moderate inflammation also often prevents it from being evacuated\r\nin a natural way. And this is requisite not only in men, but in women\r\ntoo sometimes. For this purpose are made copper pipes; and that these\r\nmay serve for all bodies larger and smaller, a physician must have by\r\nhim three for men, and two for women. Of the male kind, the largest is\r\nfifteen fingers breadth long, the middle size twelve, the least nine;\r\nfor the females, the greater is nine, and the lesser six. They ought\r\nto be curved, but more especially the male kind, and very smooth; and\r\ntheir diameter neither too large, nor too small.\r\n\r\nThe patient then is to be laid on his back, in the same manner as is\r\ndescribed in the operation for the stone, either on a couch or bed. The\r\nphysician standing on the right side, ought with his left hand to take\r\nhold of the penis if it be a man, and with his right to introduce the\r\npipe into the urinary passage; and when it comes to the neck of the\r\nbladder, by an inclination of the pipe and the penis at once, to force\r\nit into the bladder, and when the urine is evacuated, to take it out\r\nagain. In a woman, the urethra is both shorter, and straighter, and\r\nresembles a caruncle, being situated between the labia pudenda above\r\nthe vagina; and they as frequently require assistance, but it is not\r\nattended with so much difficulty.\r\n\r\nSometimes a stone sliding into the urethra, sticks, where that grows\r\nnarrower(26), not far from the end; if possible it ought to be\r\ndrawn out either by a specillum oricularium, or the instrument, with\r\nwhich the stone is extracted in cutting for that distemper. If that\r\nhas proved impracticable, the prepuce must be drawn out as much as\r\npossible, and the glans being covered, must be tied by a thread; then\r\non one side a longitudinal incision must be made into the penis, and\r\nthe stone extracted; after this the prepuce is let go; for by this\r\nmeans the sound part of the skin covers the incision in the penis, and\r\nthe urine will be discharged in the natural way.\r\n\r\nSince I have made mention of the bladder and stone, the place itself\r\nseems to require me to subjoin the _chirurgical_ cure for calculous\r\npatients, when they can be relieved no other way. But since that is\r\na very dangerous method, it is by no means proper to undertake it\r\nprecipitately. Nor is it to be attempted in every season, nor at all\r\ntimes of life, nor in every degree of the disease; but only in the\r\nspring, and upon a patient, whose age exceeds nine years, and not\r\nfourteen; also if the disease has arisen to such a height that it can\r\nneither be overcome by medicines, nor protracted, but that in some time\r\nit must kill. Not but that now and then even a rash attempt succeeds;\r\nhowever it more frequently fails in this case, because there are more\r\nkinds and seasons of danger, all which I shall mention together with\r\nthe operation itself.\r\n\r\nTherefore when it is resolved to try the last remedy, for some\r\ndays before, the body must be prepared by diet, that is, by taking\r\nmoderately wholesome food, no way glutinous, and drinking water. In the\r\nmean time the patient must exercise by walking, to cause the stone to\r\ndescend towards the neck of the bladder. Whether this has happened may\r\nbe known by introducing the fingers, as I shall shew in the operation.\r\nWhen that is certain, the boy must first fast for a day; and then the\r\noperation must be performed in a warm place; which is conducted in this\r\nmanner.\r\n\r\nA strong and skilful man sits down upon a high seat, and laying the\r\nboy, whose back is towards him, in a supine posture, setting his hips\r\nupon his knees, takes hold of him, and drawing up his legs, orders the\r\nboy to put down his hands to his hams, and pull them toward his body\r\nwith all his might, and at the same time he holds them in that posture.\r\nBut if the patient be pretty strong, two able men must sit behind him\r\non two contiguous seats, and both their seats, and their legs next each\r\nother must be tied together, to prevent their giving way. Then he is\r\nplaced upon both their knees in the same manner, and the one according\r\nas he sits, lays hold of his left leg, and the other of his right; and\r\nat the same time he himself draws up his hams. Whether he be held by\r\none or two, they lie forward with their breasts upon his shoulders.\r\nWhence it happens, that the sinus above the pubes, between the ilia, is\r\nextended without any wrinkles, and the bladder being compressed into a\r\nsmall compass, the stone may be the more easily laid hold of. Besides,\r\ntwo strong men are placed one at each side, who stand by, and do not\r\nsuffer either the one or two, that hold the boy, to give way.\r\n\r\nThen the physician, having carefully pared his nails, introduces his\r\nfore and middle fingers of the left hand together, being first slightly\r\nanointed with oil(27), into the anus of the patient, and lays the\r\nfingers of his right hand lightly upon the lowest part of his abdomen;\r\nlest if his fingers on both sides at once should press strongly upon\r\nthe calculus, it might hurt the bladder. And this must not be done\r\nhastily, as in most cases; but so as may be safest: for hurting the\r\nbladder brings on convulsions, with a danger of death. And first of all\r\nthe stone is sought for about the neck: where if it be found, it is\r\nexpelled with less trouble; and therefore I said the operation was not\r\nto be attempted, unless this were known by its proper signs. If either\r\nit was not there, or has gone backward, the fingers are applied to the\r\nend of the bladder; and the right hand being removed also beyond it, it\r\nis brought gradually down.\r\n\r\nAnd when the stone is found (as it must necessarily fall between the\r\nsurgeon’s hands) it is drawn down with the greater caution by how much\r\nit is smaller and smoother, lest it escape, that is, lest there be a\r\nnecessity to harass the bladder again and again. Therefore the right\r\nhand is always kept before the stone; and the fingers of the left force\r\nit downwards, till it come to the neck. Into which part, if it be\r\noblong, it must be forced so as to come out prone(28); if flat, so as\r\nto be transverse; if square, that it may rest upon two angles; if it be\r\nlarger at one end, so that the smallest may pass first. In a round one,\r\nfrom the figure itself it is plain, there is no difference, save that\r\nif it be smoother in one part than another, that should come out first.\r\n\r\nWhen it is brought to rest upon the neck of the bladder, a lunated\r\nincision must be made in the skin, near the anus, as far as the neck of\r\nthe bladder, with the horns pointing a little towards the ischia; then\r\nin that part where the bottom of the wound is straiter, again under the\r\nskin(29), another transverse wound must be made, by which the neck\r\nmay be cut; till the urinary passage be open in such a manner, that the\r\nwound is something larger than the stone. For those, who through fear\r\nof a fistula (which in that part the Greeks call ouroruas[HU]) make but\r\na small opening, are reduced to the same inconvenience with greater\r\ndanger; because the stone, when it is brought away by force, makes a\r\npassage, if it does not find one. And this is even more pernicious, if\r\nthe shape or asperity of the stone contribute any thing to it: whence\r\nboth an hemorrhage and convulsion may ensue. But though a person escape\r\nthese, the fistula will be much larger, when the neck is lacerated,\r\nthan it would have been if cut.\r\n\r\n  [HU] Οὐρορυὰς: this word, as far as I can find, occurs no where else.\r\n  It is variously written in the different editions. The sense seems to\r\n  determine it to what I have expressed in the translation, with which\r\n  the etymology of it agrees.\r\n\r\nWhen the opening is made, the stone comes into view; the size of which\r\nmakes a material difference _with respect to its management_. Therefore\r\nif it be small, it may be pushed forward on one side, and drawn out\r\non the other by the fingers. If larger, a crotchet(30) made for the\r\npurpose must be put over the upper part of it. This at its extremity is\r\nthin, beat out into the form of a semicircle, broad and blunt; on the\r\nexternal part smooth(31), where it comes in contact with the wound;\r\non the inside rough, where it touches the stone. And it ought to be\r\npretty long; for one too short has not force enough to extract it. When\r\nit is fixed, it ought to be inclined to each side, that the stone may\r\nappear, and be held fast, because if it be laid hold of, it also gives\r\nway to it. And the necessity for this is, lest when the crotchet begins\r\nto be drawn, the stone may fly inward, and the crotchet fall upon the\r\nedge of the wound, and lacerate it, the danger of which I have already\r\nshewn.\r\n\r\nWhen it appears that the stone is securely held, a triple motion\r\nmust be made, almost at the same instant, to both sides, and then\r\nexternally; but this must be done gently, and the stone must be first\r\ndrawn a little forward; after this, the end of the crotchet must be\r\nraised upward, that it may be farther within the bladder, and bring it\r\nout the more easily. But if the stone cannot be conveniently held at\r\nthe superior part, its side must be taken hold of. This is the most\r\nsimple method.\r\n\r\nBut a variety of circumstances requires some particular observations.\r\nFor there are some stones not only rough, but also full of sharp\r\npoints, which falling of themselves into the neck of the bladder, are\r\nextracted without any danger. But if they are within the bladder, it\r\nis neither safe to seek them, nor draw them forward; because when they\r\nwound it, they bring on convulsions and death; and more especially if\r\nany point is fixed in the bladder, and causes it to fall into folds,\r\nas it is brought down _towards the neck_. Now a stone is discovered to\r\nbe in the neck, when the urine is made with greater difficulty than\r\nordinary; and to be pointed, when it comes away bloody; and this is\r\nparticularly to be tried by the fingers, and the operation is not to\r\nbe attempted unless we are sure it is there. And even then the fingers\r\nmust be introduced, and opposed to it behind tenderly, lest they\r\nwound by pushing it with violence; then the incision must be made.\r\nAnd in this case also many have made use of the knife. Meges (because\r\nthe knife being weak might fall on some prominence of the stone, and\r\nafter having cut the flesh above it, would not divide where there is\r\na hollow, but leave what will require a second incision) made an iron\r\nstraight instrument, with a broad back on its upper part, and its\r\nlower part semicircular and sharp. This being taken between his fore\r\nand middle fingers, and his thumb laid upon it, he prest it so, that\r\ntogether with the flesh, he might cut any part of the stone that was\r\nprominent: by which he gained this advantage, that he made a sufficient\r\nopening at once. Now in whatever method the incision in the neck is\r\nmade, a rough stone ought to be extracted gently; no violence being\r\nused for the sake of expedition.\r\n\r\nBut a sandy stone is easily discovered both before the operation,\r\nfrom the discharge of sandy urine, and in the operation; because it\r\nmakes but a faint resistance to the fingers, and that not equally,\r\nand besides is apt to slide away. Also urine, that brings off with\r\nit something like scales, discovers the stones to be soft, and that\r\nthey are composed of several small ones not firmly united together.\r\nAll these it is proper to bring away gently, changing alternately the\r\nfingers in such a manner, that they may not hurt the bladder, and\r\nno broken relics stay behind, which may afterwards render the cure\r\ndifficult. Any of these, that come into view, must be extracted either\r\nby the fingers or crotchet.\r\n\r\nBut if there are several stones, they must every one be taken out;\r\nbut if any very small one remain, it may rather be left: for it is\r\ndifficult to find it in the bladder; and when found, it quickly\r\nescapes. Thus by long search the bladder is hurt, and mortal\r\ninflammations are brought on; in so much that some, though they were\r\nnot cut, when the bladder has been long, and to no purpose, roughly\r\nhandled, by the fingers, have died. Besides all which, a small stone\r\nbeing brought to the wound afterwards by the urine, drops out.\r\n\r\nIn case the stone appears so large, that it cannot be extracted without\r\nlacerating the neck, it must be split. The author of this contrivance\r\nwas Ammonius, who upon that account was called Lithotomus[HV] (_the\r\nstone-cutter_.) It is done in this manner. A crotchet is fixed upon the\r\nstone with so sure a hold as to prevent it from recoiling inward: then\r\nan iron instrument of moderate thickness, with a thin edge, but not\r\nsharp, is made use of. This is applied to the stone, and being struck\r\non the other side, cleaves it; great care being taken, that neither the\r\ninstrument come to the bladder, nor any thing fall in by the breaking\r\nof the stone.\r\n\r\n  [HV] λιθοτόμος.\r\n\r\nThese operations are performed upon females much in the same manner,\r\nconcerning whom a very few peculiarities must be mentioned. For in\r\nthem, where the stone is very small, cutting is unnecessary; because it\r\nis forced by the urine into the neck, which is both shorter, and laxer\r\nthan in men: therefore it often drops out of itself, and if it sticks\r\nin the urinary passage, which is narrower, it is however extracted\r\nwithout any harm by the abovementioned crotchet. But in larger stones\r\nthe same method is necessary. However, in a virgin, the fingers should\r\nbe introduced _into the rectum_ as in a man, in a married woman by\r\nthe vagina. Again, in a virgin, the incision must be made below the\r\nleft lip of the pudendum; but in a married woman, between the urinary\r\npassage, and the bone of the pubes; the wound also must be transverse\r\nin both places, and we need not be alarmed if the hæmorrhage be\r\nconsiderable from a female body.\r\n\r\nWhen a stone is extracted, if the patient be strong, and not greatly\r\nspent, we may let the blood flow to lessen the inflammation. And it is\r\nnot amiss for the patient to walk a little, that if any grumous blood\r\nremain within, it may drop out. But if it does not cease of itself, it\r\nmust be stopped, lest the strength be entirely exhausted; and this is\r\nto be done immediately after the operation in weak patients. For as a\r\nperson is in danger of a convulsion, whilst the bladder is fatigued, so\r\nthere is another fear, when the applications are removed, lest there be\r\nsuch an hæmorrhage as to prove mortal: to prevent which, the patient\r\nought to sit down in sharp vinegar with the addition of a little salt;\r\nby which means both the blood commonly stops, and the bladder is\r\ncontracted, and therefore is less inflamed. But if that does little\r\nservice, a cupping vessel must be applied, both in the knees(32) and\r\nhips, and above the pubes too.\r\n\r\nWhen either a sufficient quantity of blood has been evacuated, or the\r\nhæmorrhage stopped, the patient must be laid upon his back, with his\r\nhead low, and his hips a little raised; and over the wound must be\r\napplied a double or triple linen cloth wet with vinegar. Then after an\r\ninterval of two hours, he must be let down in a supine posture into\r\na bath of hot water, so that he may be under water from the knees\r\nto the navel, the other parts being covered with clothes, only with\r\nhis hands and feet bare, that he may be both less exhausted, and be\r\nable to continue there the longer. This commonly produces a plentiful\r\nsweat; which in the face is to be now and then wiped off by a spunge.\r\nAnd the rule for the continuance of this bathing is, till it hurts by\r\nweakening. After that the patient must be anointed plentifully with\r\noil, and a handful of soft wool saturated with warm oil, must be laid\r\non, so as to cover the pubes and hips, and groin, and the wound itself,\r\nwhich must still remain covered with the linen beforementioned; and\r\nthis is to be moistened now and then with warm oil; that it may both\r\nprevent the admission of cold to the bladder, and gently mollify the\r\nnerves. Some make use of healing cataplasms. These do more hurt by\r\ntheir weight, which by pressing upon the bladder(33) irritates the\r\nwound, than service by their heat: and for that reason, not so much as\r\nany kind of bandage is necessary.\r\n\r\nOn the day following, if there be a difficulty in breathing, if the\r\nurine is not evacuated, or if the part above the pubes has immediately\r\nswelled, we may be assured, that grumous blood has staid within the\r\nbladder. Therefore the fingers being introduced in the same manner as\r\nabove, the bladder must be handled gently, and whatever has happened\r\nto be coagulated there dispersed; by which means it is afterwards\r\ndischarged from the bladder through the wound. Neither is it improper\r\nto inject through the wound into the bladder by a syringe, a mixture\r\nof vinegar and nitre; for if there be any bloody concretions, they are\r\ndiscussed in that way. And these may be done even the first day, if\r\nwe are afraid of any thing being within; especially when weakness has\r\nprevented the evacuation of it by walking. The other methods laid down\r\nfor the preceding day, the putting him into the bath, applying the\r\ncloth, and wool in the manner above described, are to be continued.\r\n\r\nBut a boy is neither to be put so often into the warm water, nor kept\r\nthere so long _at a time_, as a youth; the weak, as the strong; one\r\naffected with a slight inflammation, as another, in whom it is more\r\nviolent; one whose body is disposed to evacuations, as he that is\r\nbound. But in the mean time, if the patient sleep, and his breathing\r\nbe equal, his tongue moist, his thirst tolerable, his lower belly not\r\nat all swelled, and the pain and fever moderate, we may take it for\r\ngranted that the cure goes on well.\r\n\r\nBut in such patients the inflammation ceases commonly about the fifth\r\nor seventh day: when that is abated, the bath is needless. Only the\r\nwound, as the patient lies in a supine posture, must be fomented with\r\nhot water, that if the urine corrodes, it may be washed away. Digestive\r\nmedicines must be laid on; and if the ulcer appears to want deterging,\r\nhoney may be applied. If that corrodes, it must be tempered with rose\r\noil. The enneapharmacum plaister seems fittest for this intention, for\r\nit both contains suet to promote digestion, and honey to deterge the\r\nulcer, marrow also, and especially that of veal, which is particularly\r\nefficacious in preventing a fistula from remaining. And at that time\r\nlint is not necessary over the ulcer; but is properly laid above the\r\nmedicine to keep that on. But when the ulcer is cleansed, it must be\r\nbrought to cicatrize by lint alone.\r\n\r\nAt this time, however, if the cure has not proceeded happily, various\r\ndangers arise: which one may quickly prognosticate, if there be a\r\ncontinual watching, or a difficulty of breathing, if the tongue be\r\ndry, if there be a violent thirst, if the bottom of the belly swells,\r\nif the wound gapes, if the urine that makes its way through it, does\r\nnot corrode it; in like manner, if before the third day some livid\r\nstuff drops out; if the patient makes no answers to questions, or very\r\nslowly; if there are vehement pains; if after the fifth day violent\r\nfevers come on, and a nausea continues; if lying upon the belly is the\r\nmost agreeable posture. However nothing is worse than a convulsion,\r\nand a bilious vomiting before the ninth day. But there being reason to\r\nfear an inflammation, it must be obviated by abstinence, and moderate\r\nfood seasonably administered; and by applying, at the same time,\r\nfomentations, and the other means above prescribed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. XXVII.\r\n\r\nOF A GANGRENE AFTER CUTTING FOR THE STONE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe next danger is that of a gangrene. This is known by a discharge of\r\nfetid sanies both by the wound and the penis, and together with that,\r\nsomething not very different from grumous blood, and little films like\r\nsmall locks of wool; it is also known by the lips of the wound being\r\ndry, by a pain in the groin, by the continuance of the fever, and its\r\nincrease at night, and by the accession of irregular shudderings. Now\r\nit must be considered to what part the gangrene spreads. If to the\r\npenis, that part grows hard and red, and is painful to the touch, and\r\nthe testicles swell, if to the bladder, a pain of the anus follows,\r\nthe hips swell, the legs cannot be easily extended; but if to one side,\r\nit is apparent to the sight, and has these same symptoms on either\r\nside, but not so violent.\r\n\r\nThe first circumstance of importance is, that the body lie in a proper\r\nposture, that the part into which the disease is propagated be always\r\nlaid highest. Thus if it tends to the penis, the patient should lie\r\nsupine; if to the bladder, upon his belly; if to one side, upon the\r\nother, which is sound. Then as to the means of cure, the patient must\r\nbe put into a bath made of a decoction of horehound, or cypress, or\r\nmyrtle, and the same liquor must be injected into the wound by a\r\nsyringe; then a mixture of lentils and pomegranate bark both boiled in\r\nwine must be laid on; or bramble, or olive leaves boiled in the same\r\nmanner, or other medicines, which we have prescribed for restraining\r\nand cleansing gangrenes. And if any of these shall be in a dry form,\r\nthey must be blown in through a writing reed.\r\n\r\nWhen the gangrene begins to stop, the ulcer should be washed with\r\nmulse. And at this time cerate must be avoided, which softens the\r\nflesh, and prepares it for receiving the infection. Rather let washed\r\nlead with wine be laid on; over which shall be applied the same spread\r\nupon a linen cloth: by which a cure may be accomplished. Nevertheless\r\nwe should not be ignorant, that when a gangrene has begun, the stomach,\r\nwhich has a certain sympathy with the bladder, is often affected;\r\nwhence it happens, that the food can neither be retained, nor if any is\r\nretained, can it be concocted, nor the body nourished; and therefore\r\nthe wound can neither be deterged nor incarned: which must of necessity\r\nsoon bring on death.\r\n\r\nBut as it is not possible, by any means, to save patients under these\r\ncircumstances, from the first day however, the method of cure must be\r\n_regularly_ observed. In _the conduct of_ which some caution is also\r\nnecessary with regard to the food and drink: for at the beginning,\r\nnone but moist food ought to be given; when the ulcer is deterged, of\r\nthe middle kind; greens and salt fish are always hurtful. A moderate\r\nquantity of drink is required: for if too little is drunk, the wound\r\nis inflamed, the patient labours under a want of sleep, and the\r\nstrength of the body is diminished: if too much be taken, the bladder\r\nis frequently filled, and by that means irritated. It is too plain to\r\nrequire a frequent repetition, that the drink must be nothing but water.\r\n\r\nIt generally happens from a diet of this kind, that the belly is bound.\r\nA clyster must be given of a decoction of fenugreek or mallows in\r\nwater. The same liquor mixed with rose oil, must be injected into the\r\nwound by a syringe, when the urine corrodes it, and prevents it from\r\nbeing cleansed. For the most part, at first, the urine is discharged\r\nby the wound; whilst it is healing, it is divided, and part begins to\r\nbe discharged by the penis, till the wound be entirely closed: which\r\nhappens sometimes in the third month, sometimes not before the sixth,\r\nat other times after a whole year.\r\n\r\nAnd we should not despair of a solid agglutination of the wound, unless\r\nwhere the neck has been greatly lacerated, or many and large caruncles,\r\nand at the same time some nervous substances have come away by a\r\ngangrene. But the greatest precaution must be used, that no fistula, or\r\nat least a very small one, be left there. Therefore, where the wound\r\ntends to cicatrize, the patient should lie with his thighs and legs\r\nextended: unless the stones have been soft or sandy; for in that case\r\nthe bladder is not so soon cleansed: and, therefore, it is necessary\r\nfor the wound to be longer open; and never to be brought to cicatrize\r\ntill nothing more of that nature be discharged.\r\n\r\nBut if the lips have united before the bladder was cleansed, and the\r\npain and inflammation have returned, the wound must be separated by the\r\nfingers, or the broad end of a probe, to allow a passage to what causes\r\nthe pain: which being evacuated, and the urine having come away pure\r\nfor a pretty while, cicatrizing medicines must at length be laid on,\r\nand the feet extended, as I directed before, as close to one another as\r\npossible.\r\n\r\nBut if from those causes, which I mentioned, there appears to be danger\r\nof a fistula, to close it the more easily, or at least to contract it,\r\na leaden pipe must be introduced into the anus(34); and the legs\r\nbeing extended, the thighs and ancles must be tied together, till there\r\nbe a cicatrix as good as we can obtain.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. XXVIII.\r\n\r\nOF THE OPERATIONS REQUIRED WHEN A MEMBRANE, OR FLESH OBSTRUCTS THE\r\nVAGINA IN WOMEN.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe foregoing diseases may happen both to men and women. But some are\r\npeculiar to women; as in the first place, where the vagina, by its lips\r\nbeing joined, does not admit of coition. And this happens sometimes in\r\nthe womb of the mother; at other times, from an ulcer in those parts,\r\nand the lips, in healing, having by bad management been united. If it\r\nbe from the birth, a membrane obstructs the vagina: if from an ulcer,\r\nit is filled up with flesh.\r\n\r\nIn the membrane an incision must be made in two lines crossing each\r\nother, in the form of the letter X, great care being taken not to\r\nwound the urinary passage; and then the membrane is to be cut out. But\r\nif flesh has grown there, it is necessary to open it in a straight\r\nline; then taking hold of it with a vulsella or hook, to cut off a\r\nsmall habenula, as it were, from the orifice of the vagina, after\r\nwhich must be introduced a piece of lint rolled in a long form (by the\r\nGreeks called lemniscus) dipped in vinegar; and over this sordid wool\r\nmoistened with vinegar is to be bound on; the third day, these are to\r\nbe removed, and the part dressed like other wounds. And when it begins\r\nto heal, it is proper to introduce into the part a leaden pipe armed\r\nwith a cicatrizing medicine; and over that to apply the same medicine,\r\ntill the wound be cicatrized.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. XXIX.\r\n\r\nTHE METHOD OF EXTRACTING A DEAD FOETUS OUT OF THE WOMB.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen a woman conceives, if the foetus dies in the womb, near the time\r\nof delivery, and cannot come away of itself, an operation is necessary.\r\nThis may be reckoned amongst the most difficult: for it both requires\r\nthe highest prudence and tenderness, and is attended with the greatest\r\ndanger. But above all, the wonderful nature of the womb, as in other\r\ncases, so in this also, is easily discovered.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, it is proper to lay the woman on her back, across a\r\nbed, in such a posture, that her ilia may be compressed by her thighs:\r\nwhence it happens, that both the bottom of her belly is presented to\r\nthe view of the physician, and the child is forced to the mouth of the\r\nwomb; which is close shut, when the foetus is dead, but at intervals\r\nopens a little. The physician, making use of this opportunity, having\r\nhis hand anointed, ought to introduce, at first, the fore-finger,\r\nand keep it there till the mouth be opened again, and then he must\r\nintroduce another finger, and the rest upon the like opportunities\r\noffering, till his whole hand be within it. Both the capacity of the\r\nwomb, and the strength of its nerves, and the habit of the whole body,\r\nand even the fortitude of the mind conduce much to the facility of\r\ndoing this: especially, as in some cases, it is necessary to have both\r\nhands within the womb.\r\n\r\nIt is of importance, that both the bottom of the belly, and the\r\nextremities of the body be as warm as possible; and that an\r\ninflammation be not begun, but that help be administered instantly,\r\nwhile the case is recent. For if the body be already swelled, the hand\r\ncan neither be introduced, nor the fœtus brought away without the\r\ngreatest difficulty; and together with a vomiting and tremor, there\r\ngenerally follow mortal convulsions. When the hand is introduced upon\r\nthe dead fœtus, it immediately discovers its posture: for it is either\r\nturned upon the head, or the feet, or lies transverse but commonly in\r\nsuch a manner; that either its hand or foot is near.\r\n\r\nThe intention of the physician is, by his hand, to turn the child,\r\neither upon its head, or even upon its feet, if it happened to be in\r\na different posture. And if there is no other hinderance, taking hold\r\nof the hand or foot puts the body in a better posture: for the hand\r\n_being laid hold of_, will turn it upon the head, and the foot upon its\r\nfeet. Then if the head is nearest, a crotchet should be introduced,\r\nin every part smooth, with a short point, which is properly fixed,\r\neither in the eye, or the ear, or the mouth, sometimes even in the\r\nforehead; and then being drawn outwards, brings away the child. Yet it\r\nis not to be extracted at any moment of time indifferently: for should\r\nit be attempted, when the mouth of the womb is shut, there being no\r\nexit for the child, it breaks to pieces, and the point of the crotchet\r\nslips upon the mouth of the womb itself, and there ensue convulsions,\r\nand extreme danger of death. Therefore, it is necessary to forbear,\r\nwhen the womb is shut; and when it opens, to draw gently; and every\r\nsuch opportunity to extract it gradually. The right hand must draw the\r\ncrotchet, the left being kept within, must pull the child, and at the\r\nsame time direct it.\r\n\r\nIt sometimes happens, that the child is distended with water, and there\r\nis a fœtid sanies discharged from it. If this be the case, the body\r\nmust be perforated with the fore-finger, that its bulk may be lessened\r\nby the discharge of the humour: then it must be taken out gently by the\r\nhands only: for the crotchet being fixed in a putrid body, easily loses\r\nits hold. The danger attending which, I have already pointed out.\r\n\r\nBut a child being turned upon its feet, is not difficult to extract:\r\nfor these being taken hold of, it is easily brought away by the hands\r\nalone.\r\n\r\nIf it be transverse, and cannot be got into a proper direction, a\r\ncrotchet must be fixed in the armpit, and gradually pulled: in this\r\ncase, the neck is generally doubled, and the head turns back upon the\r\nbody. The remedy is, to cut through the neck, that the two parts may be\r\nbrought away separately. This is done by a crotchet, which resembles\r\nthe former, save that it is sharp all along the internal part. Then\r\nwe must endeavour to bring away the head first, after that, the rest\r\nof the body: because generally, when the largest part is extracted,\r\nthe head slips back into the womb, and cannot be extracted without the\r\ngreatest danger.\r\n\r\nHowever, if this has happened, a double cloth must be laid upon the\r\nbelly of the woman, and a strong and skilful man ought to stand at her\r\nleft side, and put both his hands upon the lower part of her belly, and\r\npress with one upon another: by which means the head is forced into the\r\nmouth of the womb, and may then be extracted by the crotchet, in the\r\nmanner above described.\r\n\r\nBut if one foot be found at the mouth of the womb, and the other is\r\nbehind, with the body, whatever is protruded, must be gradually cut\r\naway. And if the buttocks begin to press upon the mouth of the womb,\r\nthey must be thrust back again, and the other foot sought for and\r\nbrought forward. There are also some other difficulties, which make it\r\nnecessary to cut the child into pieces, when it cannot be brought away\r\nentire.\r\n\r\nWhenever a fœtus is brought away, it must be delivered to an assistant;\r\nwho must take it in his hands, and then the physician ought to draw the\r\numbilical cord gently with his left hand, but not to break it, and with\r\nthe right to follow it, as far as what they call the secundines, which\r\nwere the covering of the fœtus within the womb; and taking hold of the\r\nextremities of these, to separate all the small veins and membranes in\r\nthe same manner, by his hand, from the womb, and to extract the whole\r\nof it, and any concreted blood that remains within. Then the woman’s\r\nthighs must be laid close together, and she placed in a room moderately\r\nwarm, without any thorough air. To the bottom of her belly must be\r\napplied sordid wool dipped in vinegar and rose-oil. The remaining part\r\nof the cure ought to be the same, as is used in inflammations, and such\r\nwounds as are in nervous parts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. XXX.\r\n\r\nTHE OPERATIONS REQUIRED IN DISEASES OF THE ANUS.\r\n\r\n\r\nDiseases of the anus also, when they are not removed by medicines,\r\nrequire the assistance of the hand. Therefore, if any fissures, in\r\nthat part, by long continuance, have become indurated, and are already\r\ncallous, it is most proper to give a clyster; then to apply a hot\r\nspunge, in order to relax them, and bring them to the external part,\r\nwhen they are in view, to cut off each of them with a knife, and renew\r\nthe ulcers; then to lay on soft lint, and over it honey spread upon a\r\nlinen cloth; and to fill up the part with soft wool, and thus bind it\r\nup; on the next and following days, to dress with mild medicines, which\r\nI have elsewhere prescribed for the same disorders when recent; and in\r\nthe first days to diet the patient with gruels, after that gradually\r\nto add to the food, but something of that kind, which I have directed\r\nin the same place. If at any time, from an inflammation, pus arises\r\nin them, as soon as that appears, an incision must be made to prevent\r\nthe anus itself from suppurating. But we must not be in a hurry to\r\ndo it before; for if it be cut while crude, the inflammation is much\r\nincreased, and a greater quantity of pus is generated. In these wounds\r\ntoo, there is a necessity for mild food, and the same kind of medicines.\r\n\r\nBut the tubercles called condylomata, when they have grown hard, are\r\ncured in this manner. First of all, a clyster must be given. Then the\r\ntubercle being laid hold of by a vulsella, must be cut out near its\r\nroots. When this is done, the same course must be followed, that I\r\nprescribed after the preceding operation; only if there is any fungus,\r\nit must be kept under by copper scales.\r\n\r\nThe mouths of the hæmorrhoidal veins, discharging blood, are taken\r\noff thus. When there is a discharge of sanies besides blood, an acrid\r\nclyster must be administered, that the mouths of the veins may be\r\npushed the farther outward; which causes all the vessels to appear like\r\nsmall heads. Then if a head be very little, and have a small base, it\r\nmust be tied with a thread a little above the point, where it joins\r\nthe anus; and a spunge squeezed out of hot water must be laid over it,\r\ntill it grow livid; then above the knot it must be scarified either by\r\nthe nail or the knife. If this is not done, violent pains ensue, and a\r\ndifficulty in making water. If it be pretty big, and the base broad, it\r\nmust be taken hold of with a small hook or two, and an incision made\r\nround the tumour, a little above the base; and neither any part of the\r\nhead must be left, nor any thing taken off the anus: which a person\r\nmay accomplish, if he neither draws the hooks too much nor too little.\r\nWhere the incision has been made, a needle should be put in, and below\r\nthat the head tied with a thread. If there be two or three of them, the\r\ninmost must be cured first; if more than that number, not all at once,\r\nlest there be(35) sore places all round the part at the same time. If\r\nthere is a discharge of blood, it must be received in a spunge; then\r\nlint must be applied; the thighs, groin, and what lies contiguous to\r\nthe ulcer, be anointed, and cerate laid over it, and the part filled\r\nwith warm barley meal, and thus bound up. The day following, the\r\npatient ought to sit down in warm water, and be dressed with the same\r\ncataplasm. And twice in the day, both before and after the dressing,\r\nthe ischia and thighs must be anointed with liquid cerate, and the\r\npatient kept in a warm place. After an interval of five or six days,\r\nthe lint is to be taken out with a specillum oricularium; and if these\r\nheads have not dropped off at the same time, they must be pushed off\r\nby the finger. Afterwards, the ulcer must be brought to heal by mild\r\nmedicines, such as I have prescribed before. The proper treatment, when\r\nthe disease is cured, I have already mentioned elsewhere.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. XXXI.\r\n\r\nOF VARICES IN THE LEGS.\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom these disorders we go on to the legs. Varices in these are not\r\ndifficult to remove. To this place I have deferred the cure of those\r\nsmall veins, which hurt in the head, as also the varices in the\r\nbelly, because it is the same in them all. Therefore any vein that\r\nis troublesome, either is cauterized, and so decays, or is cut out.\r\nIf it be straight, or though transverse, yet simple, it is better to\r\ncauterize it. If it be crooked, and as it were twisted into orbs, or\r\nseveral of them are involved within each other, it is more convenient\r\nto cut them out.\r\n\r\nThe method of cauterizing is this. An incision is made in the skin over\r\nit; then the vein being laid bare, is moderately pressed by a small and\r\nblunt iron instrument red hot: and we must avoid burning the lips of\r\nthe wound itself, which it is easy to draw back with small hooks. This\r\nis repeated over the whole varix, at the distance of about four fingers\r\nbreadth; and after that a medicine for healing burns is laid on.\r\n\r\nBut it is cut out in this manner. An incision being made in the same\r\nway in the skin over the vein, the lips are taken up with a small hook;\r\nand the vein is separated all round from the flesh by a knife, but in\r\nthis great care is taken not to wound the vein itself; and a blunt hook\r\nis put under it; and generally, at the same distance mentioned before,\r\nin the same vein, the same operation is repeated. The course of it is\r\neasily discovered by extending it with the hook.\r\n\r\nWhen this has been done, as far as the varices go, the vein, being\r\nbrought forward in one part by the hook, is cut through, then where\r\nthe next hook is, it is drawn up and pulled away, and is cut off\r\nthere again. And in this manner the leg being entirely freed from the\r\nvarices, the lips of the wounds are then brought together, and an\r\nagglutinating plaister is laid over them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. XXXII.\r\n\r\nOPERATIONS REQUIRED IN COHERING AND CROOKED FINGERS.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf the fingers, either from the birth, or by an ulceration in their\r\nopposite sides, have afterwards adhered together, they are separated by\r\nthe knife; round each of them a plaister, not greasy, is put on, and\r\nthus they heal separately.\r\n\r\nBut if there has been an ulcer in a finger, and afterwards a cicatrix\r\ninjudiciously brought on, has rendered it crooked; in the first place\r\na malagma must be tried. If that does no good (which generally happens\r\nboth in an old cicatrix, and where the tendons are hurt) then we\r\nought to see whether the fault be in the tendon or the skin. If in\r\nthe tendon, it ought not to be touched, for it is not curable: if in\r\nthe skin, the whole cicatrix must be cut off, which being generally\r\ncallous, prevents the fingers from being extended. Then being kept\r\nextended, it must be brought to cicatrize afresh.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. XXXIII.\r\n\r\nOF THE OPERATION REQUIRED IN A GANGRENE.\r\n\r\n\r\nI have elsewhere observed, that a gangrene comes about the nails,\r\narmpits or groin; and that if it does not yield to medicines, the\r\nmember ought to be cut off.\r\n\r\nBut even this is attended with very great danger: for the patients\r\noften die in the operation, either by a hæmorrhage, or faintings. But\r\nin this, as well as other cases, it is not to be considered, whether\r\nthe remedy is very safe, which is the only one we have. Between the\r\nsound and corrupted part then, an incision must be made with a knife in\r\nthe flesh, as far as the bone. But this must not be done over a joint;\r\nand some of the sound part must rather be cut off, than any of the\r\ncorrupt left. When we come to the bone, the sound flesh must be drawn\r\nback from it, and cut below round the bone, that some part of the bone\r\nmay also be laid bare under it; then the bone must be cut off with a\r\nsaw, as close as we can to the sound flesh, that still adheres to it;\r\nand then the fore part of the bone, that has been roughened with the\r\nsaw, must be smoothed, and the skin brought over it; which in a cure\r\nof this kind ought to be lax, that it may cover the bone as much as\r\npossible all round. The part, which the skin does not reach, must be\r\ncovered with lint, and above that a spunge squeezed out of vinegar must\r\nbe tied on the place. The remaining part of the cure must be the same,\r\nas I have directed in wounds which are brought to digestion(36).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA. CORNELIUS CELSUS\r\n\r\n        OF\r\n\r\n     MEDICINE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_BOOK VIII._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. I.\r\n\r\nOF THE SITUATION AND FIGURE OF THE BONES OF THE HUMAN BODY.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt now remains, that I speak of what relates to the bones: for the\r\neasier understanding of which, I shall first describe their situations\r\nand forms. The first then is the skull, which is concave on the\r\ninternal side, externally gibbous, and on each side smooth, both where\r\nit covers the membrane of the brain, and where itself is covered by\r\nthe skin, from which the hair grows. In the occiput and temples it\r\nis simple; but double from the forehead to the vertex. And the bones\r\nof it in their external part are hard; on the inside, where they are\r\nconnected with each other, softer. And veins are distributed between\r\nthem, which probably supply them with nourishment.\r\n\r\nNow the skull is rarely entire without sutures; but in hot countries it\r\nis more frequently found so. And such a head is strongest, and the most\r\nsafe from pain; of others, the fewer sutures there are, so much the\r\nfreer is the head from complaints; for their number is not certain, nor\r\nindeed their situation. However, for the most part two above the ears\r\ndivide the temples from the upper part of the head; the third running\r\nto each side through the vertex, separates the occiput from the top\r\nof the head; the fourth goes from the vertex along the middle of the\r\nhead to the forehead; and this ends in some at the point, to which the\r\nhair extends, in others between the eye-brows, dividing the forehead\r\nitself(1). The other sutures are exactly fitted to each other upon\r\nthe same level. But the transverse ones above the ears, grow gradually\r\nthinner to their edges; and thus the inferior bones slightly overtop\r\nthe superior ones. The bone behind the ear is the thickest in the\r\nhead; for which reason, probably hair does not grow there. Over these\r\nmuscles too(2), that cover the temples, a bone is situated in the\r\nmiddle, which is inclined to the external part. But the face has the\r\nlargest suture; which beginning from the one temple runs transversely\r\nthrough the middle of the eyes, and the nose, to the other temple; from\r\nwhich two short ones point downward under the internal angles. The\r\ncheek-bones also have each of them a transverse suture in the upper\r\npart. And from the middle of the nose, or the sockets of the upper\r\nteeth, proceeds one through the middle of the palate; and another also\r\ndivides the palate transversely. These then are the sutures found in\r\nmost people.\r\n\r\nThe largest foramina of the head are those of the eyes; next the\r\nforamina of the nose; then those we have at the ears. The foramina of\r\nthe eyes run straight and undivided to the brain. Two foramina are\r\nobserved in the nose, divided by a bone in the middle: for these about\r\nthe eye-brows and angles of the eyes begin osseous, and so proceed\r\nnear the third part of the way; then turning cartilaginous, the nearer\r\nthey approach to the mouth, so much the softer and more fleshy they\r\nbecome. But these foramina, which from the beginning of the nostrils\r\nto the internal part are simple, are there again divided each into two\r\ncourses; the branches opening into the fauces both emit and receive\r\nthe breath; the others go to the brain; in the end they are branched\r\ninto many small openings, which afford the sense of smelling. In the\r\near too the passage at first is straight, and simple, but farther in,\r\nit becomes winding; the part next the brain is separated into many and\r\nsmall openings, from which we have the faculty of hearing. Near these\r\nthere are as it were two small sinuses; and above them, that bone\r\nterminates, which going in a transverse direction from the cheeks is\r\nsustained by the inferior bones. It may be called jugale from the same\r\nresemblance, which gave it the Greek name of Zygodes[HW]. The maxilla\r\nis a soft bone(3), and only one in number: the middle and lowest\r\npart of which compose the chin; from whence it proceeds on both sides\r\nto the temples; and this only moves: for the malæ with the whole bone,\r\nthat contains the upper teeth, are immoveable: but the extremities of\r\nthe maxilla shoot as it were into two horns. One of these processes is\r\nbroader below(4), and is narrowed at the vertex, and being extended\r\nforward enters below the os jugale, and over that is tied down by the\r\nmuscles of the temples. The other is shorter and rounder, and is lodged\r\nlike a hinge in that cavity, which is near the foramina of the ear;\r\nand there turning itself different ways, gives the maxilla a power of\r\nmoving.\r\n\r\n  [HW] ζυγὼδες.\r\n\r\nThe teeth are harder than bone; part of them are fixed in the lower\r\njaw-bone, and part in the upper. The four first from their cutting\r\nare by the Greeks called tomici[HX]. On each side of these _above and\r\nbelow_ stand the four canine teeth; beyond which there are commonly\r\nfive maxillary teeth, except in those, in whom the genuine (_dentes\r\nsapientiae_) which generally grow late, have not come out. The fore\r\nteeth adhere each by one root, the maxillary by two at least, some by\r\nthree or four. And a longer root commonly emits a shorter tooth; and\r\nthe root of a straight tooth is straight, that of a crooked one bent.\r\nFrom this root in children, a new tooth springs, which most frequently\r\nforces out the former; sometimes however it appears above or below it.\r\n\r\n  [HX] τομικοὶ.\r\n\r\nNext to the head is the spine, which consists of twenty-four Vertebræ.\r\nThere are seven in the neck, twelve by the ribs, and the other five are\r\nbelow the ribs. These are round and short, and send out two processes\r\non each side; in the middle they are perforated, where the spinal\r\nmarrow, connected with the brain, descends. The sides also between\r\nthe two processes are perforated by small holes, through which, from\r\nthe membrane of the brain similar small membranes proceed. And all\r\nthe Vertebræ(5) (except the three uppermost) at the superior part\r\nin the processes themselves have small depressions; at the lower, on\r\nthe contrary, they send out processes pointing downwards. The first\r\nthen immediately sustains the head, by receiving small processes of it\r\ninto two depressions; which is the reason that the surface of the head\r\nbelow is rendered unequal by two prominences. The second is inserted\r\ninto the under part of the first, and the superior part of the second\r\nis round and narrow (_processus dentatus_) in order to admit of a\r\ncircular motion, so that the first surrounding the second allows the\r\nhead to move towards each side. The third receives the second in the\r\nsame manner; whence the neck has great facility of motion. And indeed\r\nit would not be able to sustain the head, if straight and strong nerves\r\non each side did not secure the neck; these the Greeks call Carotæ.\r\nFor one of them in every flexure, being always stretched, prevents the\r\nupper parts from slipping further. The third Vertebra has prominences,\r\nwhich are inserted into that below it. All the rest are inserted\r\neach into its inferior one by processes pointing downwards; and by\r\ndepressions, which they have on each side, they receive the superior,\r\nand are secured by many ligaments, and a great quantity of cartilage.\r\nAnd thus one moderate flexure forward being allowed, a man both stands\r\nerect for some kinds of employment, and at other times bends himself as\r\nthe actions he is engaged in require.\r\n\r\nBelow the neck, the first rib is situated opposite to the shoulders.\r\nAfter that the six inferior ones(6) reach the bottom of the breast:\r\nand these at their origin being round, and furnished with something\r\nlike small heads, are fixed to the transverse processes of the\r\nvertebræ, which are in that part a little depressed; then they grow\r\nbroader, and bending outward, degenerate gradually into cartilage;\r\nand in that part being again turned gently inward, are joined to the\r\npectoral bone: which begins strong and hard at the fauces, being\r\nexcavated on each side, and terminates at the præcordia, where it is\r\nsoftened into a cartilage. And under the superior ribs there are five,\r\nwhich the Greeks call Nothæ (_spurious_) shorter, and thinner, which\r\nalso gradually turn to cartilage, and adhere to the external parts of\r\nthe abdomen; the lowest of these in the greatest part of it is nothing\r\nelse but a cartilage.\r\n\r\nFrom the neck two broad bones, one on either side, go to the shoulders,\r\nby us called scutula operta, by the Greeks Omoplatæ. These have\r\ncavities at their vertices; from the vertices they become triangular,\r\nand growing gradually broader tend to the spine; and the broader they\r\nare in any part, so much the duller is their sensation. These too at\r\ntheir extremity are cartilaginous, and in their back part lie as it\r\nwere loose, because, unless at the top, they are fixed to no bone, but\r\nare there tied down by strong muscles and nerves.\r\n\r\nBut at the first rib(7) a little within the middle of it, a bone\r\ngrows out, in that part indeed slender; but going forward, the nearer\r\nit comes to the broad bone of the scapula, it becomes thicker, and\r\nbroader, bending a little inwards, which being a little enlarged at its\r\nother vertex, sustains the clavicle. This bone is crooked, and is to be\r\nreckoned amongst the hardest bones; the one end of it is joined to the\r\nbone I just mentioned before, and by the other it is fixed in a small\r\ndepression of the pectoral bone, and is moved a little in the motion of\r\nthe arm; and its lower head is connected by ligaments and a cartilage\r\nwith the broad bone of the shoulders.\r\n\r\nHere the humerus begins, which at both its ends is enlarged, soft,\r\nwithout marrow, and cartilaginous; in the middle round and hard, and\r\ncontaining marrow; is a little concave(8) in its fore and internal\r\npart; and convex in its posterior and external part. Now the fore part\r\nis next the breast; the posterior is toward the scapulæ; the internal\r\nnext the side; and the external at the greatest distance from the side:\r\nwhich distinctions will afterwards appear applicable to all joints in\r\nthe extremities. The upper end of the humerus is rounder than the other\r\nbones, which I have yet mentioned, and _a small part of it_ is inserted\r\ninto the vertex of the broad bone of the shoulder; the greatest part,\r\nstanding out of it, is secured by ligaments. But the inferior head\r\nhas two processes; the intermediate space between which, is even more\r\ndepressed than its extremities.\r\n\r\nThis affords a reception to the fore-arm; which consists of two bones.\r\nThe Radius, which the Greeks call cercis[HY], is the superior one and\r\nshorter, and at first being more slender, with its ends round, and\r\na little concave, receives the small tubercle of the humerus, which\r\nis secured there by ligaments and a cartilage. The cubitus is the\r\ninferior and longer; it is at first larger in its upper end, and by\r\ntwo vertices, as it were, standing out, fixes itself into the sinus\r\nof the humerus, which I mentioned, betwixt its two processes. The two\r\nbones of the fore arm at first(9) are close together, then separate\r\nby degrees, and meet again at the hand, their former proportions being\r\nreversed: for there the radius is pretty large, and the cubitus very\r\nsmall. After that the radius rising to a cartilaginous head is inserted\r\ninto its neck. The cubitus is round at its extremity, and projects a\r\nlittle on one part. And to save frequent repetition, this ought to be\r\nknown, that most bones end in a cartilage, and that every articulation\r\nis thus terminated: for it could neither be moved, unless it pressed\r\nupon something smooth, nor be joined with flesh and ligaments, unless\r\nthese were connected by some matter of a middle nature.\r\n\r\n  [HY] κερκὶς.\r\n\r\nIn the hand, the first part of the palm consists of many and small\r\nbones, the number of which is uncertain. But all of them are oblong and\r\ntriangular, and connected together by a peculiar kind of structure,\r\nthe plain of each one being higher than another alternately; whence it\r\nhappens, that the whole makes up the appearance of one bone a little\r\nconcave on the internal part. But from the hand two small processes\r\nare lodged in the cavity of the radius. Then at the other end five\r\nstraight bones going to the fingers, compleat the palm; from which\r\nthe fingers themselves have their origin. These consist each of three\r\nbones. The conformation of them all is the same. The more internal\r\nbone has a depression in its vertex, and receives the small tubercle\r\nof the external, and these are secured by ligaments. From them arise\r\nthe nails, which grow hard: and thus they adhere by their roots, not\r\nto bone, but rather to flesh. This then is the construction of the\r\nsuperior parts.\r\n\r\nBut the lower part of the spine ends in the hip-bone, which is\r\ntransverse, and far the strongest, and defends the womb, bladder, and\r\nintestine Rectum. And this in the external part is convex; at the spine\r\ninclined backward; on the sides, that is, at the hips themselves,\r\nit has round cavities; from whence arises the bone, which is called\r\npecten; and that being situated transversely over the intestines under\r\nthe pubes, strengthens the belly; it is straighter in men, but in women\r\nmore bent externally, that it may not prevent the birth.\r\n\r\nFrom these proceed the thigh bones; the heads of which are still\r\nrounder than those of the humeri; though the latter have more\r\nrotundity, than is found in any of the rest. A little lower they have\r\ntwo processes on the fore and posterior part. From that they descend\r\nhard and full of marrow, externally convex, and are again enlarged at\r\nthe inferior heads. The superior ones are inserted into the cavities of\r\nthe hip-bone, as the humeri into the bones of the scapulæ; then, lower\r\ndown, they slope gently inward, that they may more equally sustain the\r\nsuperior parts. And their inferior heads have also depressions between\r\nthem, that they may be the more easily received by the bones of the\r\nleg: which articulation is covered by a small, soft, and cartilaginous\r\nbone, which is called Patella. This floating above, and not being fixed\r\nto any bone, but bound down by flesh and tendons, and a little more\r\ninclined to the thigh bone, defends the joint in all flexures of the\r\nlegs.\r\n\r\nThe leg consists of two bones; for in every thing the thigh resembles\r\nthe arm, and the leg the fore-arm; so that the shape and elegance of\r\nthe one may be known from the other; which beginning with the bones,\r\nanswers also in the flesh. One of these bones is situated on the\r\nexternal part of the calf of the leg, and from that properly enough\r\ntakes the name of Sura(10). This is shorter and more slender above,\r\nbut is enlarged at the ancles. The other, which is placed in the fore\r\npart, and has the name of Tibia, is longer and larger in the upper\r\npart, and is alone connected with the lower end of the thigh-bone, as\r\nthe cubitus is with the humerus: and these bones too, being joined both\r\nbelow and above, separate in the middle, as those of the fore arm.\r\n\r\nThe leg bones are received below by a transverse bone in the ancle;\r\nand that is situated above the heel bone; which in one part has a\r\ndepression and in another prominences, and it both receives the\r\nprocesses from the ancle-bone, and is inserted into its cavity. And\r\nthis is hard, without marrow, and projecting more to the posterior part\r\nmakes a round figure there. The other bones of the foot are constructed\r\nin a similar manner to those of the hand. The soles answer to the\r\npalms, the toes to the fingers, and the nails to the nails.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. II.\r\n\r\nGENERAL DIVISION OF DISORDERS IN THE BONES. OF A BLACKNESS AND CARIES,\r\nAND THEIR TREATMENT.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhenever a bone is injured, it is either corrupted, or fissured, or\r\nfractured, or perforated, or contused, or dislocated. A corrupted bone\r\ngenerally turns first oily, and afterwards either black or carious.\r\nThese cases happen from large ulcers, or fistulas over them, when they\r\nhave either grown antient, or have been seized with a gangrene. First\r\nof all it is necessary to lay bare the bone, cutting out the ulcer, and\r\nif the disorder extends farther than the ulcer was, to pare away the\r\nflesh below, till the sound part of the bone be exposed all round; then\r\nit is sufficient to cauterize the part that is oily, once or twice,\r\nby the application of an iron instrument, that so a scale may cast\r\noff; or to scrape it, till some blood appear, which is the mark of a\r\nsound bone: for whatever is vitiated must necessarily be dry. The same\r\nmethod must also be pursued in a cartilage that is injured; for that\r\ntoo must be scraped by a knife, till what remains be sound. And then\r\nwhat is thus scraped, whether bone or cartilage, must be sprinkled with\r\nnitre well powdered. And nothing else is to be done, where a caries or\r\nblackness is in the surface of the bone: for in that case, the cautery\r\nor the scraping must only be continued a little longer. A person,\r\nthat scrapes these, ought to press the instrument boldly, that he may\r\nboth do it effectually, and have the sooner done. The operation is\r\nfinished, when we come to the white or firm bone. It is evident, that\r\nwhen the defect is a blackness, it ends in the white, and that where\r\nthere is a certain degree of solidity, there the caries terminates. We\r\nhave already observed, that there is also some blood in a sound bone:\r\nBut when either of these happen to go in pretty deep, it is uncertain\r\nwhere they end.\r\n\r\nIt is easy to form a judgment in a caries, if a small probe is\r\nintroduced into the foramina, which by penetrating more or less, shews\r\nthat the caries is either in the surface, or of greater depth. The\r\nsame may be collected(11) even from the pain and fever; for when\r\nthese are moderate, it cannot have penetrated deep. A greater certainty\r\nis obtained however by the application of the perforator: for the\r\ndisease ends, where the dust of the bone ceases to be black. Therefore\r\nif the caries has gone deep, several holes must be made in it by the\r\nperforator, as deep as the disease goes; then into these holes must be\r\nput hot irons, till the bone become entirely dry. For the consequences\r\nof this operation will be, that whatever is spoilt will be separated\r\nfrom the bone below; and the cavity will be filled up with flesh;\r\nand afterwards either no humour at all, or a small quantity will be\r\ndischarged.\r\n\r\nBut if the blackness goes through(12) to the other side of the\r\nbone, it ought to be cut out. The same may be done also in a caries,\r\nthat penetrates to the other side of the bone. But where the whole is\r\nspoilt, the whole must be taken away. If the inferior part is sound,\r\nso far as is corrupted, ought to be cut out. Likewise if the skull or\r\npectoral bone, or a rib be carious, the actual cautery is needless, but\r\nthere is a necessity for excision. Neither does the opinion of these\r\npeople deserve our attention, who defer the excision to the third day\r\nafter the bone is laid bare, before they cut it out; for in all cases\r\nit is safer to perform an operation, before an inflammation come on.\r\nTherefore both the skin is to be cut, and the bone laid bare, and freed\r\nfrom every fault, as far as possible, in the same moment. Now a disease\r\nin the pectoral bone is far the most pernicious of any; because though\r\nthe operation have succeeded well, it hardly ever restores a perfect\r\nsoundness.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. III.\r\n\r\nOF THE USE OF THE MODIOLUS AND PERFORATOR, AND OTHER INSTRUMENTS,\r\nESPECIALLY FOR THE BONES OF THE HEAD.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are two ways of cutting out a bone; if the part injured be very\r\nsmall, by a modiolus, which the Greeks call chœnicion[HZ], if larger\r\nby terebræ. I shall explain the method of each. The modiolus is a\r\nconcave and round iron instrument with serrated edges in its lowest\r\nextremity; through the middle of which is put a pin, surrounded also\r\nby an interior circle. Of perforators there are two kinds: one of them\r\nresembling that, which carpenters use; the other with a longer head,\r\nwhich begins from a sharp point, and then turns quickly broader; and\r\nagain from another beginning goes upward with thickness pretty near\r\nequal.\r\n\r\n  [HZ] χοινίκιον. This was the name of a measure among the Greeks, and\r\n  from its resemblance in shape, they have probably used the same word\r\n  for this chirurgical instrument; for the same reason, I suppose the\r\n  Romans have named it _modiolus_. Though I have chosen to retain our\r\n  author’s term, yet the reader will see the difference is not material\r\n  betwixt that, and the trepan of our surgeons; the terebra comes so\r\n  near to the perforator, that I have used the modern term for it.\r\n\r\nIf the disease be confined to a small space, so that the modiolus can\r\ncover it, that must be used preferably. But if a caries appear below,\r\nthe pin in the middle is put into the opening. If there be a blackness,\r\na small hole is made by the angle of a chisel(13) to receive the\r\npin, that the modiolus resting upon that, by being turned round may\r\nnot slip, and then it is turned like the perforator by a strap. And\r\nthere is a certain degree of pressure required, that both a perforation\r\nmay be made, and it may go round; because if it be lightly impressed,\r\nit does not produce the effect; if too much, it has no motion. And it\r\nis not improper to drop in a little rose oil or milk, the smoothness\r\nof which may make it turn with the greater ease; yet too much of the\r\nliquid blunts the edge of the instrument. But when the modiolus has\r\nmarked out a way for itself, the middle pin is taken out, and it is\r\nworked about by itself. And then, when the soundness of the inferior\r\npart is discovered by the dust, the modiolus is taken away.\r\n\r\nBut if the disease is more extended than to be covered by that, we must\r\nmake use of the perforator. By this a hole is made in the limit, that\r\ndivides the injured from the sound part of the bone; and not far from\r\nthat a second, and a third, till the part, that is to be cut out, be\r\nsurrounded with these holes. And in this case too the dust indicates\r\nhow deep the perforator is to go. Then a chisel being drove by a mallet\r\nfrom one hole to another, cuts out the intermediate space between them;\r\nand thus a circumference is formed like to that, which is imprinted in\r\na smaller circle by the modiolus. In whichever way the circle has been\r\nmade, let the same chisel, laid flat on the corrupted bone, smooth each\r\nsuperior lamina, till the bone be left entirely sound.\r\n\r\nA blackness hardly ever goes quite through a bone, but a caries does,\r\nespecially where the skull is faulty. There also the disorder is\r\ndiscovered by the probe, which being introduced into the hole, that\r\nterminates at the sound part of the bone, both finds some resistance,\r\nand comes out moist. If it prove pervious, the probe going in deeper\r\nbetween the bone and the membrane, meets with no resistance, and comes\r\nout dry: not because there is no corrupt sanies within, but because it\r\nis there diffused, as being in a larger cavity.\r\n\r\nNow whether a blackness, which the perforator has discovered, or a\r\ncaries, which the probe has shewn, pass through the bone, the use of\r\nthe modiolus is generally fruitless: because, where the disease has\r\npenetrated so deep, it must also necessarily be largely extended in\r\nbreadth. Here then we must use the second kind of perforator above\r\ndescribed; and to prevent its growing too hot, it must be dipped now\r\nand then in cold water. But then we must proceed with greater caution,\r\nwhen we have perforated either half through in a simple bone, or the\r\nsuperior lamina in a double one. The space itself guides us in the\r\nfirst case; and in the other, the blood. Therefore at that time the\r\nstrap must be drawn slower, the left hand should press more gently, and\r\nbe taken off pretty frequently: also the depth of the perforation is\r\nto be considered, that we may be sensible whenever the bone is broke\r\nthrough, and run no risque of wounding the membrane of the brain by its\r\npoint, from which proceed violent inflammations, with danger of death.\r\n\r\nWhen the holes are made, the intermediate spaces must be cut out in\r\nthe same manner, but with much more circumspection; lest the angle of\r\nthe chisel chance to wound the same membrane; till a passage be made,\r\nthrough which the instrument to protect the membrane may be introduced.\r\nThe Greeks call it meningo-phylax[IA]. It is a copper plate, firm,\r\nbent a little upward towards the end, and externally smooth: which\r\nbeing introduced in such a manner, that its external surface be next\r\nthe brain, is put under that part, which is to be separated by the\r\nchisel; and if it receives its angles, it stops its progress; and upon\r\nthis account the physician repeats his strokes upon the chisel both\r\nmore boldly, and more safely, till the bone being cut out all round is\r\nraised by this plate, and may be taken away without any hurt to the\r\nbrain. When the whole bone is taken out, the edges must be scraped\r\nround and smoothed, and if any dust has fallen upon the membrane, it\r\nmust be gathered up. When the superior part is taken away, and the\r\ninferior left, not only the edges, but the whole bone must be smoothed,\r\nthat the skin may afterwards generate upon it without being hurt, which\r\ngrowing upon a rough bone, does not immediately become sound, but\r\nproduces new pains.\r\n\r\n  [IA] Μηνιγγοφύλαξ: the etymology of this word answers exactly to its\r\n  use: it is delineated by Scultet. tab. 2. fig. 9.\r\n\r\nThe steps to be taken after the brain is uncovered, I shall mention,\r\nwhen I come to fractured bones. If any base is preserved, medicines\r\nnot greasy, that are calculated for recent wounds, must be applied,\r\nand over them must be laid sordid wool moistened with oil and vinegar.\r\nIn process of time flesh grows from the bone itself, which fills up\r\nthe cavity made by the operation. And when any bone is cauterized,\r\nit separates from the sound part, and granulations sprout up between\r\nthe sound and mortified part, which expel what has separated. And\r\nthis, because it is a thin and small lamina, by the Greeks is called\r\nlepis[IB], that is, a scale.\r\n\r\n  [IB] λεπὶς.\r\n\r\nIt may happen too, that from a blow, a bone may be neither fissured,\r\nnor broke through, but the surface of it only contused, and rendered\r\nrough. When this occurs, it is sufficient to scrape and smooth it.\r\nThough these methods are most commonly practised in the head, yet they\r\nare common to the other bones too; so that wherever the like case\r\nshall occur, the same remedy must be used. But as they are fractured,\r\nfissured, perforated, and contused, they require some particular\r\nmethods of cure in each kind, and in most of them, some general ones\r\nalso. Of these I shall proceed to treat, beginning with the head.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. IV.\r\n\r\nOF FRACTURES OF THE SKULL.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen a blow has been received upon the skull, we must immediately\r\nenquire, whether the person has vomited bile; whether he have lost\r\nhis sight, or his speech; whether blood has issued by his nostrils,\r\nor ears; whether he has immediately fallen down; whether he has lain\r\ninsensible, as if asleep: for these do not happen without a fracture of\r\nthe bone. And when they occur, we may be assured, that an operation is\r\nnecessary, but of uncertain success. If besides, a torpor has come on;\r\nif he is delirious, if either a palsy, or a convulsion has followed, it\r\nis probable that the membrane of the brane too is wounded; and of such\r\npatients there is still less hope. But if none of these have ensued,\r\nand it may be doubted, whether the bone be fractured, it is first to be\r\nconsidered, whether the blow was given by a stone or a stick, or iron,\r\nor any other weapon, and whether _the instrument_ was smooth, or rough,\r\nsmall or large, whether struck with force, or more lightly; because\r\nthe more gentle the stroke was, so much the more easily we may suppose\r\nthe bone to have resisted it. But it is best to examine that by a more\r\ncertain mark. Therefore a probe ought to be introduced where the wound\r\nis, neither too small nor sharp, lest if it should light upon any of\r\nthe natural sinuses, it mislead us into an opinion of a fracture,\r\nwhere there is none; and not too thick, lest small fissures escape it.\r\nWhen the probe comes to the bone, if nothing but what is smooth and\r\nslippery occur, one may judge it to be sound; if there is an asperity,\r\nespecially where there are no sutures, that is an evidence the bone is\r\nfractured.\r\n\r\nHippocrates has recorded, that he was himself deceived by the sutures.\r\nThis is the custom of great men, who have a just consciousness of their\r\nown superior abilities: for little minds, because they are deficient\r\nin every thing, never allow themselves to be deficient in any. An\r\ningenuous confession of an error is worthy of a great genius, who will\r\nhave enough besides to entitle him to esteem; and it is especially\r\n_laudable_ in a practical art, which is handed down to posterity for\r\ntheir benefit; that they may not be deceived in the same way another\r\nwas deceived before them. A regard to the memory of a professor, in\r\nother respects so great a man, led us into this digression.\r\n\r\nNow a suture may deceive for this reason, because it is equal in\r\nasperity to the other; so that though there be a fissure, one may\r\nreadily take it for a suture, in a place, where it is likely one lies\r\nbelow. Therefore it is not fit to be thus deceived; but the safest\r\nmethod is to lay bare the bone: for, as I observed before, the place\r\nof the sutures is not certain; and the same part may both have this\r\nnatural junction, and be fissured by a blow, or may have some fissure\r\nnear it. Nay sometimes, when the blow has been violent, though nothing\r\nbe found by the probe, yet it is better to open it. And if even then\r\nthe fissure is not manifest, writing ink must be drawn over the bone,\r\nand then scraped off with a chisel, for if there be any fissure it\r\nretains the blackness.\r\n\r\nSometimes it even happens, that the blow has been given on one side,\r\nand the bone fissured on the other. For that reason, if upon receiving\r\na violent blow, bad symptoms have followed, and no fissure be found in\r\nthat part, where the skin is lacerated; it is not improper to consider,\r\nwhether any part on the opposite side be softer, and swelled; and to\r\nopen that; for there a fissure in the bone will be found. Nor is\r\nit very troublesome to heal the skin again, though nothing has been\r\ndiscovered by the incision. A fractured bone, unless help be seasonably\r\nadministered, brings on violent inflammations, and is treated with more\r\ndifficulty afterwards.\r\n\r\nRarely, but sometimes it happens, that the whole bone remains sound;\r\nbut from the blow some internal vein in the membrane of the brain is\r\nbroke, and discharges blood, which being coagulated there, raises\r\nviolent pains, and deprives some people of their sight. But there is\r\ngenerally a pain in the part that covers it, and an incision being made\r\nin the skin there, the bone is found pale; and therefore this must also\r\nbe cut out. Upon whatever account this operation is necessary, if the\r\nopening of the skin is too small, it must be enlarged, till all the\r\ninjured part be in view. In this great care must be taken to leave upon\r\nthe bone no part of that fine membrane that covers the skull below the\r\nskin; because when this is lacerated by the chisel, or perforators, it\r\nexcites violent fevers with inflammations. Therefore it is better to\r\nseparate it entirely from the bone. If the external wound be made by\r\nthe blow, we cannot alter the form of it. If we are to make one, the\r\nbest is that made by two transverse lines in the shape of the letter\r\nX, that afterwards the skin may be cut below, beginning at each of the\r\nprominent angles.\r\n\r\nIf blood is discharged in the time of doing this, it must be frequently\r\nrestrained by a spunge dipped in vinegar, and taken up by lint applied\r\nupon it, and the head raised high. This accident is attended with no\r\ndanger except among the muscles, which secure the temples; but even in\r\nthat place there is no safer method.\r\n\r\nIn almost every fissure, or fracture of the bone, the ancient\r\nphysicians had immediate recourse to instruments to cut it. But it\r\nis far the best method, first to try plaisters that are composed for\r\nthe skull. Some one of these, it is proper to soften with vinegar,\r\nand apply alone upon the fissured or fractured bone; then over that,\r\nsomewhat broader than the wound, a piece of linen spread with the same\r\nmedicine, and besides that, sordid wool dipped in vinegar; then to bind\r\nup the wound, and open it again every day; and dress it in this manner\r\nfor five days; from the sixth, to foment it also with the vapour of\r\nhot water by a spunge, continuing all the former treatment. And if\r\ngranulations begin to grow, if the febricula is either gone, or abated,\r\nif the appetite has returned, and the patient gets sufficient sleep, we\r\nmust continue the same dressings. Some time after, the plaister must be\r\nsoftened, with the addition of a cerate made of rose oil, to promote\r\nthe growth of flesh: for, by itself, it has a repellent quality. By\r\nthis method often the fissures are filled with a kind of callus, which\r\nis as it were a cicatrix in a bone. And in large fractures, if the\r\nbones do not cohere together in any part, they are united by the same\r\ncallus; and this is a far better covering to the brain, than the flesh\r\nthat grows, when the bone is cut out. If, under the first treatment,\r\nthe fever increases, the sleeps are short and disturbed by dreams, the\r\nulcer is moist and does not fill, small glandular swellings rise in the\r\nneck; the pains are violent; and with all these the loathing of food\r\nincreases; then, and only in that case, recourse must be had to the\r\nhand and the chisel.\r\n\r\nThere are two dangers attending a blow upon the skull; that it be\r\neither split, or depressed in the middle. If it is fissured, the lips\r\nof it may be compressed; either because one of them rises above the\r\nother, or even because they have run together again with force: whence\r\nit happens, that a humour descends upon the membrane, and has no vent,\r\nand thus irritates it, and brings on violent inflammations.\r\n\r\nWhen the bone is depressed in the middle, it presses upon that same\r\nmembrane of the brain; and sometimes also some sharp points from the\r\nfracture, prick it. In the cure of these cases as little as possible\r\nmust be taken off the bone. Therefore, if one edge rests upon the\r\nother, it is sufficient to cut off the prominence with a plain chisel.\r\nAfter that is removed, if the fissure gapes a little, it is enough for\r\nthe cure. But if the edges are compressed together, an opening must be\r\nmade with the perforator, at a finger’s breadth distance on one side,\r\nand from that the chisel must be carried in two lines, to the fissure,\r\nin the form of the letter Λ: so that the vertex of it may be at the\r\nopening, and the base at the fissure.\r\n\r\nBut if the fissure extends to a great length, it will be proper to\r\nrepeat the operation from another foramen; and thus nothing that is\r\nbroke off can be concealed under the bone, and a large opening is\r\nprocured for whatever is hurtful within. Nor is it necessary to cut\r\nout the whole of a fractured bone, though it be depressed; but if it\r\nbe either entirely broke through, and has separated wholly from the\r\ncranium, or if it adhere to _the surrounding skull_ in a small part,\r\nit must be divided from the sound bone by the chisel. Then in the\r\ndepressed bone, near the fissure we have made, holes must be bored;\r\nif the injured part be small, two; if larger, three; and the spaces\r\nbetwixt these must be cut out; and then the chisel must be drove on\r\nboth sides to the fissure, in such a manner as to make a semicircular\r\ncavity, and let the middle part be toward the fracture, and the horns\r\npoint to the sound bone. Then if any pieces be loose, and can be\r\neasily taken away, they must be removed by the forceps, which is made\r\nfor that purpose, especially those sharp pieces, which irritate the\r\nmembrane. If this cannot be easily done, the plate, which I called\r\nmeningo-phylax, must be put below it; and above that whatever is\r\nprickly, and stands inward, must be cut off; and whatever is depressed\r\ninward must be raised by the same plate. The effect of such treatment\r\nis, that the fractured bones, if they adhere together in any part, may\r\nbe consolidated; and wherever they are broke away, in time they may be\r\nseparated by medicines without any pain; and at the same time a space\r\nmay be left sufficiently large between them, to evacuate the sanies;\r\nand the brain may have a better protection from the bone than it would\r\nhave had, if that were cut out.\r\n\r\nAfter these things are done, the membrane must be sprinkled with\r\nsharp vinegar; that, if there be a discharge of blood from it, it may\r\nbe restrained, or if any blood remain coagulated within, it may be\r\ndiscussed; then the same medicine must be applied, softened in the\r\nmanner above prescribed, to the membrane itself; the other directions,\r\nwhich relate to the linen spread, and the sordid wool, must be observed\r\nin the same manner, and the patient must be kept in a warm place, and\r\nthe wound dressed every day; and in summer even twice.\r\n\r\nBut if, by reason of an inflammation, the membrane has swelled, warm\r\nrose oil must be infused upon it. If it shall swell to such a height\r\nas to rise above the bones, it will be restrained by lentils well\r\npowdered, or vine leaves powdered, and mixed with either fresh butter,\r\nor recent goose fat; and the neck will require to be mollified by\r\nliquid cerate made of iris ointment. But if the membrane shall appear\r\nnot to be clean, equal quantities of the plaister and honey must be\r\nmixed; which must be infused upon it; and to keep that on, a piece of\r\nlint or two must be clapped on, and that again covered with a linen\r\ncloth spread with a plaister. When the membrane is sufficiently clean,\r\ncerate must be added in the same manner to the plaister to promote the\r\ngrowth of flesh.\r\n\r\nAs to abstinence, and the food, and drink, in the first and more\r\nadvanced stages of the cure, the same rules must be observed which I\r\nprescribed in wounds, and with the greater exactness, by how much a\r\nhurt in this part is more dangerous. Nay even when it shall be fit to\r\nallow such a quantity of food as not barely to sustain the patient, but\r\nto nourish him, yet every thing that requires chewing must be avoided;\r\nalso smoke, and whatever excites sneezing. The membrane being moveable,\r\nand of its natural colour, granulations of ruddy flesh, and an easy\r\nmotion of the lower jaw and neck, afford certain hopes of recovery. The\r\nbad signs are, the membrane immoveable, black, livid, or of any other\r\nvitiated colour; a delirium, acrid vomiting, a palsy, or convulsion,\r\nlivid flesh, or rigor of the jaws and neck. The other symptoms that\r\nrelate to sleep, appetite, fever, and the colour of the pus, are either\r\nsalutary or mortal, as in other wounds.\r\n\r\nWhen the case succeeds well, the growth of flesh begins from the\r\nmembrane itself; or if the bone in that part be double, it sprouts from\r\nthence too, and fills up the void space between the bones; sometimes\r\nit even rises higher than the surface of the skull. If that happens,\r\ncopper scales must be sprinkled on to keep it down; and medicines\r\napplied to bring a cicatrix over it, which is easily obtained in every\r\nplace, except the part of the forehead, which is a little above the\r\nspace that lies between the eyebrows (_sinus frontalis_): for there, an\r\nulceration for the whole life after, can hardly be prevented; this must\r\nbe covered with a linen cloth spread with a medicine. And the following\r\ndirections must be always observed in a fractured skull, that till the\r\ncicatrix be strong, the sun, wind, frequent bathing, and excess in wine\r\nbe avoided.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. V.\r\n\r\nOF FRACTURES OF THE NOSE.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the nose, both the bone and the cartilage are liable to be\r\nfractured; and that sometimes happens in the fore part, sometimes on\r\none side. If either both, or one of them be fractured in the fore part,\r\nthe nostrils fall in, and the breath is drawn with difficulty. If the\r\nbone is fractured on one side, that part is hollow; if the cartilage,\r\nthe nostrils are turned to the opposite side.\r\n\r\nAny part of the cartilage, that has given way, must be gently raised,\r\neither by a probe put under it, or two fingers compressing it on both\r\nsides; then lint platted of a due length, sewed up in soft leather,\r\nmust be put within; or some part of a dry penecillum composed in the\r\nsame manner; or a large quill dipped in gum or joiner’s glue, and\r\ncovered with soft leather, which prevent the cartilage from sinking\r\nin. But if the fracture be in the fore part, both nostrils are to be\r\nequally filled. If on one side, what is put in ought to be thicker\r\nin that part where the nose falls in, and smaller on the other; and\r\nexternally, a soft strap must be carried round, the middle of which is\r\nspread with fine flour and soot of frankincense mixed together; and\r\nthis must be drawn beyond the ears, and the two ends being crossed\r\nthere and returned, are to be glued to the forehead: for it sticks to\r\nthe skin like glue, and when it has grown hard, it keeps the nostrils\r\nfirm. But if what is put within gives pain, which happens chiefly where\r\nthe interior part of the cartilage is broke through, the nostrils being\r\nraised in the same(14) manner, must be only held firm by the strap\r\nabovementioned; then, after fourteen days, that must be removed; it is\r\nto be separated by hot water, with which also the swelled part(15)\r\nmust be fomented every day.\r\n\r\nBut if the bone be fractured, that must also be reduced into its\r\nplace by the fingers; and when the fracture is in the fore part, both\r\nnostrils must be filled; when on the side, that to which the bone has\r\nbeen forced; cerate also must be applied, and it is to be bound down a\r\nlittle more tightly; because in that part, there not only grows callus\r\nenough to make it sound, but even to form an eminence. From the third\r\nday, it must be fomented with hot water, and the more so, the nearer\r\nit may be expected to approach a sound state. And if there be several\r\nsmall pieces in the fracture, nevertheless each of them _that are beat\r\nin_, must be forced into its place by the fingers: also the strap must\r\nbe applied externally, as before directed; and over that a cerate,\r\nwithout any other bandage.\r\n\r\nBut if any fragment be separated all round, and will not be united with\r\nthe rest, as may be known from the humour, which will be discharged in\r\ngreat quantity from the wound, it must be extracted by a vulsella; and\r\nwhen the inflammation is gone, some one of those medicines that are\r\ngently repellent, must be applied. The case is worse, when besides a\r\nfracture of the bone, or cartilage, there is also a wound in the skin.\r\nThis very seldom occurs. When it does happen, they must nevertheless\r\nbe raised to their place in the same manner; and upon the skin must be\r\nlaid some one of these plaisters, that are adapted to recent wounds:\r\nbut no bandage must be applied over it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. VI.\r\n\r\nOF FRACTURES OF THE EARS.\r\n\r\n\r\nSometimes the cartilage of the ear is broke. When this happens, an\r\nagglutinating medicine must be applied, before a suppuration begins;\r\nfor that often prevents it, and heals the ear. Both here and in the\r\nnose, it should be understood, that the cartilage itself is not\r\nre-united, but that the flesh growing round it consolidates the part;\r\nand therefore, if, together with the skin the cartilage is broke,\r\nthe skin is sewed on both sides; but I now speak of the cartilage\r\nfractured, when the skin is entire. If pus then is already formed, the\r\nskin must be opened on one side, and over against the incision, the\r\ncartilage itself must be cut in a lunated form; then a gentle styptic\r\nmust be used; such as lycium diluted with water, till the bleeding be\r\nstopped; after that a plaister that is not greasy, spread upon linen,\r\nmust be laid on, and soft wool put behind the ear, to fill up the\r\nspace between that and the head; then it must be fastened by a gentle\r\nbandage; and from the third day fomented with warm water, as I directed\r\nfor the nostrils; and in these kinds of accidents, at first abstinence\r\nis necessary, till the inflammation be gone.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. VII.\r\n\r\nOF A FRACTURED MAXILLA, TOGETHER WITH SOME GENERAL OBSERVATIONS\r\nRELATING TO FRACTURES.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs I am to proceed from these parts to the lower jaw, I think it proper\r\nto insert some observations relating to all the bones in general, to\r\nprevent a frequent repetition of them. Every bone then is sometimes\r\nsplit longitudinally, like wood, sometimes is fractured transversely,\r\nsometimes obliquely; and in this last species the ends are sometimes\r\nblunt, sometimes acute, which last is of the worst kind; because they\r\nare not easily united, where they do not rest upon something obtuse,\r\nthen they also wound the flesh, and sometimes a nerve or a muscle:\r\nmoreover, one fragment sometimes happens to be divided into several. In\r\nfractures of the other bones, one end often recedes entirely from the\r\nother; but the broken ends of a jaw-bone remain always in contact in\r\nsome one part.\r\n\r\nTherefore, first the bones are to be forced into their place, by two\r\nfingers pressing on each side, both within the mouth and upon the\r\nchin; then if the fracture of the jaw-bone be transverse, (in which\r\ncase one tooth generally stands out beyond that next to it) when it is\r\nreduced, the two contiguous teeth, or if they are loose, those next to\r\nthem, must be tied together by a horse-hair. In a different kind of\r\nfracture this is needless. All the other steps are the same _as in the\r\nabove-described fractures_; for a double linen cloth dipped in wine and\r\noil must be laid upon it, and with that fine flour, and the soot of\r\nfrankincense; then a roller or soft strap, with a longitudinal opening\r\nin the middle, that it may take in the chin both above and below; and\r\nlastly, the ends of it must be brought over the head and tied there.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the bones in general, it may further be remarked once\r\nfor all, that fasting at first is necessary; then from the third day\r\nmoist food; when the inflammation is removed a little fuller diet and\r\nsuch as promotes the growth of flesh; wine is hurtful through the whole\r\ntime. On the third day, they ought to be opened, and fomented with the\r\nvapour of hot water by a spunge, and the same dressings, as at first,\r\nare to be put on; this to be repeated on the fifth day, and so on,\r\ntill the inflammation is gone, which ceases, either on the ninth day,\r\nor generally on the seventh: when that is removed, the bones must be\r\nexamined again, that if any fragment is not in its place, it may be\r\nreduced, and the bandage must not be taken away, till two thirds of the\r\ntime have elapsed, in which the several bones unite.\r\n\r\nNow, generally between the fourteenth and twenty-first day, the\r\nfollowing bones heal: the lower jaw, cheek-bone, clavicle, breast-bone,\r\nscapula, ribs, the spine at the hips, the ancle-bone, heel, hand, and\r\nfoot; between the twentieth and thirtieth, the bones of the leg and\r\nfore arm; between the twenty-seventh and fortieth, the arm and thigh\r\nbones.\r\n\r\nBut concerning the lower jaw-bone I must add, that the case requires\r\nthe long use of a liquid diet. Also far a considerable time pancakes\r\nand such like must be continued, and nothing be chewed, till the callus\r\nhas perfectly restored the strength of the bone: and for some days, at\r\nfirst, the patient must not speak at all.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. VIII.\r\n\r\nOF A FRACTURED CLAVICLE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe clavicle, if it be fractured transversely, sometimes unites very\r\nwell of itself, and if it be not moved, may do well without a bandage;\r\nbut sometimes, and especially when it is moved, it slides away; and\r\ngenerally the part next the breast lies over, and behind that next the\r\nhumerus. The reason of which is, that it does not move by itself;\r\nbut complies with the motion of the humerus: therefore, this standing\r\nstill, the humerus is moved upon it. That part of the clavicle, next\r\nthe breast, very seldom lies on the forepart; insomuch that men of\r\ngreat character in the profession have told us they never met with it;\r\nbut the authority of Hippocrates is sufficient to put the fact beyond\r\ndispute.\r\n\r\nHowever, as these cases are dissimilar, so each requires a treatment\r\nsomewhat different from the other. When the clavicle flies back\r\ntowards the scapulæ, the humerus must be pushed backward by the palm\r\nof the right hand, and at the same time the clavicle itself be brought\r\nforward. When turned to the breast, this must be forced backward, and\r\nthe humerus brought forward; and if the humerus fall below the other,\r\nthat part of the bone next the breast must not be depressed, because it\r\nis immoveable; but the humerus itself must be raised; but if it rise\r\nhigher, the part next the breast must be filled with wool, and the arm\r\nbound down to the breast. If there be sharp pieces in the fracture, an\r\nincision must be made in the skin over it; and any parts of the bone,\r\nthat wound the flesh, must be cut off; then the blunted bones must be\r\nbrought together; and if there be a prominence any where, it must be\r\nkept down by a linen cloth, three times folded, dipped in wine and oil:\r\nif there be several fragments, they are to be covered with a splint,\r\nthe inside of which is to be smeared with wax, lest the roller should\r\nslip on one side. The roller must be bound over the clavicle, when\r\nreduced, rather often than tight: and this rule holds in all fractures.\r\nIn a fracture of the right clavicle, the bandage ought to pass from\r\nit to the left arm-pit; if, of the left _clavicle_, to the right;\r\nand again under the arm-pit of the affected bone: this done, if the\r\nclavicle be inclined toward the scapula, the fore-arm must be tied to\r\nthe side; if forward, to the neck; and the patient laid on his back.\r\nAll the other directions given before must be observed.\r\n\r\nNow there are several bones that have very little motion, and are\r\neither hard, or cartilaginous, which are liable to be fractured, or\r\npierced, or bruised, or fissured, as the malae, the breast-bone,\r\nscapula, ribs, spine of the hips, ancle-bone, heel, hand, and foot.\r\nThe method of cure is the same in all these. If there is an external\r\nwound, that must be dressed with the medicines proper for it. While\r\nthe wound is healing, a callus also fills up the fissures of the bone,\r\nor any vacuity that may be in it. If the skin is entire, and from the\r\npain we infer that the bone is injured, there is nothing else to do but\r\nrest; and cerate must be applied, and tied on gently, till the pain is\r\nremoved by the bone becoming sound.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. IX.\r\n\r\nOF FRACTURES OF THE RIBS AND SPINE.\r\n\r\n\r\nBut there are some peculiarities to be observed relating to the ribs;\r\nbecause they are near the viscera, and that part is exposed to great\r\ndangers. A rib then is sometimes fissured in such a manner, that not\r\nthe exterior surface of the bone, but the interior part of it, which is\r\nthin, is hurt; sometimes it is broke entirely through. If the whole is\r\nnot fractured, there rarely follows either a spitting of blood, or a\r\nfebricula, or any suppuration; and the pain is not great; however the\r\nplace is slightly pained upon being touched. But this case requires no\r\nmore than to do what is above directed; and in binding it up to begin\r\nat the middle of the roller (_a double-headed roller_) lest it draw the\r\nskin to either side. After the twenty-first day, when the bone ought to\r\nbe united, we must endeavour, by a more plentiful diet, to render the\r\nbody as plump as possible, that it may cover the bone the better; which\r\nbeing yet tender is in that part exposed to injuries under a thin skin.\r\nAnd through the whole time of the cure, vociferation must be avoided,\r\nand even speaking, hurrying, anger, all violence of motion, smoke,\r\ndust, and whatever excites either coughing or sneezing; and it is not\r\neven proper to hold in the breath much.\r\n\r\nBut if a rib be entirely broke through, the case is more troublesome:\r\nfor both violent inflammations, and a fever and suppuration, and often\r\na danger of death ensue; and a spitting of blood. Therefore, if the\r\nstrength admits, blood must be taken from the arm of the same side\r\nwith the rib; if it does not allow this, a clyster must be given,\r\nbut without any thing acrid; and the patient must fast a considerable\r\ntime. He must not eat bread before the seventh day, but live upon\r\ngruel alone; and upon the part must be applied cerate made of lycium,\r\nwith an addition of boiled resin; or the malagma of Polyarchus; or\r\ncloths squeezed out of wine, rose oil, and common oil; and over these\r\nsoft sordid wool, and two double-headed rollers, but not tight. What\r\nI mentioned before as hurtful, are in this case to be avoided with\r\ngreater caution; so that even the breath must not be too often fetched.\r\nBut if a cough be troublesome, a potion must be taken for it, either\r\nof germander, or rue, or the herb staechas, or of cummin and pepper.\r\nWhen there are severe pains, it is proper to lay on a cataplasm either\r\nof darnel or barley, with an addition of a third part of mellow figs.\r\nAnd this must lie on in the day time; but in the night, either cerate,\r\nor a malagma, or cloths; because the cataplasm may drop off. Therefore\r\nit must be opened every day, till such time as we may be content with\r\nthe cerate or malagma. And for ten days the body must be reduced by\r\nfasting; from the eleventh we must begin to nourish it; and therefore\r\nthe bandage about it must be more lax than at first; and generally this\r\nmethod is continued to the fortieth day.\r\n\r\nIn the course of which, if there be any fear of a suppuration,\r\nthe malagma will be more effectual to discuss it than cerate. If,\r\nnotwithstanding, the suppuration take place, and cannot be discussed\r\nby the medicines prescribed before, no time must be lost, lest the\r\nbone below be affected; but in the part where it shall swell most,\r\na hot iron must be introduced, till it reach the pus, which must be\r\nevacuated. If a tumour does not appear any where, we may discover where\r\nthe pus is principally lodged in this manner. We must rub all the part\r\nwith Cimolian chalk, and suffer it to dry; and wherever the moisture\r\nshall penetrate deepest, there the pus is nearest to the skin; and here\r\nthe actual cautery is to be used. If there shall be a pretty large\r\nabscess, it will require two or three perforations; and lint to be put\r\ninto them, or some part of a penecillum; which may be tied by a thread\r\nat the top, that it may be easily drawn out. What remains to be done is\r\nthe same as in other burns. When the ulcer shall be clean, the body\r\nmust be nourished, lest a consumption follow, which would be fatal.\r\nSometimes too, when the bone is more slightly affected, and neglected\r\nat first, not pus, but a certain humour like mucus is collected within,\r\nand the skin over it grows soft; in which case, we must use the cautery\r\nin the same manner.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Fracture of the spine._]\r\n\r\nThere is also something peculiar to be noted in the spine: for if any\r\npart has separated from a vertebra, or is any way broken(16), the\r\npart becomes hollow; prickings are felt there, because these fragments\r\nmust necessarily be jagged: whence it happens, that the patient now and\r\nthen leans forward. These are indications of the case; and the same\r\nmedicines are necessary, which have been mentioned in the first part of\r\nthis chapter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. X.\r\n\r\nOF FRACTURES OF THE HUMERUS, FORE-ARM, THIGH, LEG, FINGERS, AND TOES.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe cases which occur in the arms and thighs, and their methods of\r\ncure, are in a great measure similar. There are also some general\r\nthings that belong equally to the arms, fore-arms, thighs, legs,\r\nfingers, and toes; for a fracture in the middle of these is least\r\ndangerous; but the nearer the fracture is, either to the superior or\r\ninferior head, so much the worse: for it both creates greater pain,\r\nand is more difficult to cure. Of fractures, the most innocent is a\r\nsimple transverse one; worse, where it is oblique, and where there are\r\nfragments; worst of all, when these are sharp. Sometimes the bones\r\nin these parts being fractured, continue in their places: but they\r\nmuch more frequently give way, and one part lies over the other. This\r\ncircumstance ought to be first of all considered; and there are certain\r\nmarks for knowing it. If they are displaced, they are bent, and cause\r\nthe sensation of pricking, and are unequal to the touch. But if they\r\nmeet one another, not directly, but obliquely (which happens, when they\r\nare not in their place) that limb is shorter than the other, and the\r\nmuscles of it swell.\r\n\r\nTherefore, if this is found to be the case, it is proper to extend the\r\nlimb immediately: for the tendons and muscles being _in a natural state\r\nkept_ stretched by the bones, are _in this case_ contracted; neither do\r\nthey return to their place, unless they be extended by force. Again,\r\nif that is neglected for some days at first, an inflammation comes on,\r\nduring which, it is both difficult and dangerous to use violence to the\r\ntendons; for there follows a convulsion or gangrene; or at least, which\r\nis the mildest of the bad consequences, a suppuration; therefore, if\r\nthe bones have not been replaced before _the inflammation_, they must\r\nnot be reduced till after it is gone. Now one person alone may extend a\r\nfinger, also any other member, if it be of a child, by taking hold of\r\none part with his right hand, and the other with his left. A stronger\r\nlimb requires two to pull different ways. If the tendons are very firm,\r\nas is the case in robust men, and chiefly in their thighs and legs, the\r\nends of the joints on both sides must be tied with straps, or linen\r\nrollers, and pulled contrary ways by several persons; and when this\r\nforce has stretched the limb a little beyond its natural length, then\r\nthe bones must be pressed by the hands into their place; and the sign\r\nof a bone’s being reduced, is the removal of the pain. The limb being\r\nmade equal with the other, must be wrapt up in cloths two or three\r\ntimes doubled, dipped in wine and oil; for which purpose linen is best.\r\n\r\nSix bandages are generally required. The first to be applied is the\r\nshortest; which should be rolled about the fracture(17), and ascend\r\nspirally like a screw; and it is sufficient for it to go round in this\r\nmanner thrice. The second is one half longer than this; which, if\r\nthe bone project in any part, must begin there; if it be every where\r\nequal, it may begin any where upon the fracture, and go in an opposite\r\ndirection to the former, tending downwards, and returning again to\r\nthe fracture, end in the upper part beyond the former bandage. Over\r\nthese must be laid cerate, upon a broad piece of linen, to keep them\r\non. And if the bone is prominent in any part, a cloth, three times\r\ndoubled, moistened in the wine and oil before mentioned, must be laid\r\nupon it. These are to be secured by a third and a fourth bandage, in\r\nsuch a manner, that the following move always in a contrary direction\r\nto the former, the third alone must end in the lower part, and the\r\nother three in the superior; because it is better to make several\r\nconvolutions, than to bind it tight; for a strict bandage disorders\r\na part, and makes it liable to a gangrene. We ought to bind an\r\narticulation as little as possible; but if the fracture of the bone is\r\nnear the joint, there is a necessity for it.\r\n\r\nWhen the limb is bound up, it must be kept so to the third day, and\r\nthe bandage should be such, as on the first day not to hurt _by its\r\nstricture_, and yet not to seem lax; on the second it should be a\r\nlittle laxer; the third almost loosened. Therefore, the limb must then\r\nbe bound up again, and a fifth roller must be added to the former;\r\nafter which it must be again opened on the fifth day, and then secured\r\nby six rollers, in such a manner, that the third and fifth may end\r\nbelow, and the rest above. As often as the limb is opened, it must be\r\nfomented with hot water. But if the fracture be near a joint, wine,\r\nwith the addition of a small proportion of oil, must be dropped upon\r\nit for a long time, and all the other directions observed, till the\r\ninflammation leave it, or the limb become smaller than ordinary: which,\r\nif it does not happen on the seventh day, will certainly be effected by\r\nthe ninth. Then the bones are handled with great ease.\r\n\r\nTherefore, if they are not well joined to each other, they must be set\r\nagain; and if any fragments rise above the rest, they must be reduced\r\ninto their places, and then the limb must be rolled up in the same\r\nmanner, and splints be fitted round it, to keep the bones in their\r\nplaces. And on that side, to which the fracture inclines, a broader\r\nand stronger splint must be applied. About a joint all these should\r\nturn outward, that they may not hurt it, and be bound no tighter than\r\nis necessary to secure the bone: as they grow laxer in time, they must\r\nbe a little tightened every third day by their straps; and if there\r\nbe no itching nor pain, continue so, till two-thirds of the time be\r\ncompleated, in which each of these bones unites; afterwards, it is to\r\nbe bathed more gently with hot water; for at first it is necessary to\r\ndissipate the humours, and afterwards to make them transpire. Therefore\r\nit must also be anointed lightly with liquid cerate, and the surface of\r\nthe skin rubbed; and the fracture be bound up more loosely. It must be\r\nopened every third day, and all the applications be repeated, except\r\nthe hot water; only one of the rollers, as often as it is loosed, must\r\nbe withdrawn.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Of a fractured humerus._]\r\n\r\nThe foregoing rules are general; the following peculiar to each\r\nbone. If the humerus be fractured, the extension must not be made as\r\nin another limb; but the patient is placed in a high seat, and the\r\nphysician in a lower one opposite to him. Then the patient’s fore-arm\r\nis to be supported by a bandage passed round it, and fastened behind\r\nthe neck. _This done_, a second bandage, _with two heads_, is to be\r\nrolled round the upper part of the humerus, and have its two ends\r\ntied into a knot above the head. Lastly, a third bandage of the like\r\nkind is to be fastened to the lower part of the humerus, and carried\r\ndownwards, its two ends being also tied together. Then, from behind\r\nthe patient’s head, an assistant stretching his own arm _through the\r\nloop of_ the second mentioned roller, his right, if the right humerus\r\nis to be extended, his left, if the left _humerus_, takes hold of a\r\nstick placed between the patient’s thighs; the physician also sets his\r\nright foot, if he be to operate upon the left humerus, his left, if\r\nupon the right, on the third of these rollers; and at the same time the\r\nassistant raises the one roller, and the physician depresses the other;\r\nby which means, the humerus is gently extended. If the fracture be in\r\nthe middle or lower part of the bone, shorter rollers are required; if\r\nin the superior, longer; so that they may be extended from thence over\r\nthe breast, under the other arm-pit to the shoulders. In binding it\r\nup, the fore-arm must be so inclined, and the affected part put into\r\nsuch a position by the bandages, that the suspending of the forearm\r\nafterwards, do not turn the humerus any other way, than when it was\r\nbound up. And the fore-arm being hung, the humerus is to be also gently\r\ntied down to the side; by which means it will be prevented from moving,\r\nand therefore the bones continue as they have been set. When we come to\r\nthe application of splints, these ought to be longest on the external\r\nside, shorter on the fore-part, but shortest of all under the arm-pit.\r\nAnd when the humerus is fractured near the cubitus, they must be pretty\r\noften removed, lest the tendons there grow rigid, and the fore-arm be\r\nrendered useless. Whenever they are removed, the fracture must be held\r\nin the hand; and the cubitus fomented with hot water, and rubbed over\r\nwith soft cerate; and splints must either not be put upon the processes\r\nof the cubitus at all, or they must be somewhat shorter _than the\r\nothers_.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Of a fracture of the fore-arm._]\r\n\r\nBut if there is a fracture in the fore-arm, it must be first of all\r\nconsidered, whether one bone or both be broken: not that there is any\r\ndifferent method of cure to be used; but first that the extension may\r\nbe the stronger, if both bones be fractured, because the tendons must\r\nnecessarily be less contracted, when one of the bones is entire, and\r\nkeeps them upon the stretch; in the next place, that every thing which\r\nrelates to securing the bones, may be done with the greater accuracy,\r\nif one of them does not help the other: for where one is unhurt, it\r\nhelps more than rollers and splints. The fore-arm ought to be tied\r\nup with the thumb turned a little toward the breast; for that is the\r\nmost natural posture of the fore-arm: and after the bandages are put\r\non, it is best held in a scarf, the full breadth of which is under the\r\nfore-arm, with its ends, which are very narrow, fixed over the neck;\r\nthus the arm is conveniently suspended from the neck, and ought to hang\r\na little higher than the other elbow.\r\n\r\nBut if any part of the top of the cubitus be fractured, it is improper\r\nto secure it by bandages, because the fore-arm becomes immoveable. And\r\nif means only are found(18) to remove the pain, it remains as useful\r\nas before.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Fractures of the thighs and legs._]\r\n\r\nIt is of equal importance in the leg for one of the bones to continue\r\nentire. Both in this and the thigh it is fit after binding it up to\r\nput it in a box. This box ought to have holes below, through which any\r\nhumour that is discharged, may descend; and at the foot a prop, which\r\nmay both sustain, and not suffer it to slip; and holes in the sides,\r\nthrough which straps being past, some bars[IC] may keep the leg and\r\nthigh in their position. If it be a fracture of the leg, this ought to\r\nreach from the foot to the ham; if of the thigh, as far as the hip;\r\nif near the head of the thigh-bone, so as that the hip likewise may\r\nbe within it. We ought not to be ignorant, however, that a fractured\r\nthigh becomes shorter, because it never entirely returns to its former\r\nstate; and that the person ever after supports himself upon his toes in\r\nthat foot, which occasions great weakness; however it is much worse,\r\nwhere the misfortune has been encreased by neglect.\r\n\r\n  [IC] morae.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Fractures of the fingers._]\r\n\r\nIt is sufficient to bind a finger to one small twig, after the\r\ninflammation is gone.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _General rules._]\r\n\r\nThe foregoing directions are confined to the cases relating to\r\nparticular limbs; the following are general: fasting for some days\r\nat first; then when the callus is growing, a pretty full diet; long\r\nabstinence from wine; plentiful fomentations of hot water, while\r\nthe inflammation continues; when that has ceased, they must be more\r\nsparing; lastly, a pretty long but gentle rubbing of liquid cerate\r\ninto the more remote parts. Nor must the limb be immediately put upon\r\nexercise, but by degrees returned to its former motions.\r\n\r\nThe case is a good deal worse, when, besides the fracture of the bone,\r\nthere is also a wound in the flesh; and particularly if that happen in\r\nthe muscles of the thigh or arm: for the inflammations there are much\r\ngreater, and they are more liable to gangrenes. And generally, where\r\nthe bones of the thigh have slipped past each other, it is necessary\r\nto cut it off. The arm is also endangered in the same circumstances,\r\nbut is more easily preserved. And these dangers are still more to be\r\napprehended, if the fracture be near the joints: therefore, such a case\r\nmust be treated with more care, and the muscle must be cut through\r\ntransversely over the middle of the wound; and if the hæmorrhage has\r\nbeen but small, the patient must be bled, and extenuated by fasting\r\nfor ten days. And though the other limbs may be extended slowly, and\r\nthe bones reduced gently to their place; yet in these it is not quite\r\nexpedient either to extend the tendons, or handle the bones. And the\r\npatient must be allowed to keep them in the position that is easiest\r\nto him. To all such wounds must be applied, at first, lint dipped in\r\nwine, with an addition of a very little rose oil: the other management\r\nis the same as above recommended. They are to be bound up with rollers\r\nbroader(19) than the wound; which must be applied looser, than if\r\nthere was not a wound there; and as the wound is more liable to\r\ncorruption and a gangrene, we are by a number of rollers to manage it\r\nso, that though they are slack, they may keep the bones firm.\r\n\r\nThis method may be followed in the thigh or arm, provided the bones\r\nhave chanced to return to their proper place; but if they be in any\r\ndifferent situation, they must only have such a bandage, as will keep\r\non the medicine that is applied. The other directions I gave before\r\nmust be observed: except that neither splints nor boxes be used, with\r\nwhich the wound cannot heal; but only more and broader rollers are\r\nnecessary; and both hot oil and wine must be poured upon them now and\r\nthen; more frequently the latter. At the beginning the patient must\r\nfast; the wound must be bathed with hot water; he must avoid the cold;\r\nand recourse must be had to medicines for promoting digestion of the\r\nwound, and more care must be taken of the wound than the bone: for that\r\nreason it must be opened every day and dressed.\r\n\r\nIn the mean time, should any small fragment of the bone project, if\r\nit be blunt, it must be reduced into its place; if sharp, its point,\r\nwhen long, must first be cut off, when short, filed, and in either case\r\nsmoothed with a chisel; and then it must be returned in again. And if\r\nthat cannot be done by the hand, a vulsella, such as workmen make use\r\nof, must be applied with that part(20) which turns inward to the\r\nsharp point of the bone, that by its convex part the prominent bone\r\nmay be thrust into its place. If it be too large, and covered by small\r\nmembranes, we should allow these to be dissolved by medicines, and when\r\nthe bone is laid bare, cut it off; which is to be done pretty early,\r\nand afterwards, in this method we may let the bone unite and the wound\r\nheal; the first in its proper time, and the other as the circumstances\r\nadmit.\r\n\r\nSometimes too it happens in a large wound, that some fragments as it\r\nwere mortify, and do not unite with the rest. This may be discovered\r\nfrom the quantity of discharge; which makes it necessary to open the\r\nulcer oftener than it is dressed; and the consequence generally is,\r\nthat this bone, after some days, of itself falls off; otherwise, though\r\nthe condition of the wound is miserable enough before, that often\r\nencreases it, and makes it more tedious of cure. The bone too is often\r\nbroken away, when the skin is entire, and immediately an itching and\r\npain come on. Wherefore, if that happens it is proper to open it the\r\nsooner, and bathe it in the summer time with cold water; and in the\r\nwinter with water just warm; and then apply myrtle cerate.\r\n\r\nSometimes, the fracture, by some points like prickles, irritates\r\nthe flesh: which being discovered by the itching and prickings, the\r\nphysician must open it, and cut off these points. The other part of the\r\ncure is the same in both these cases as in a recent wound. When the\r\nulcer is clean, nourishing food must be taken. If the limb is still too\r\nshort, and the bones are not in their places, a wedge of the smallest\r\nand smoothest kind must be put in between them with its head standing\r\nout a little, and the thick part of it must be driven farther in every\r\nday, till that limb be equal to the other. Then the wedge must be taken\r\nout, and the wound healed up. When a cicatrix is brought on, it must be\r\nbathed with a decoction of myrtle, ivy, and other like vervains, cold,\r\nand a drying medicine applied upon it; and in this case, there is a\r\ngreater necessity for rest, till the limb recover its strength.\r\n\r\nWhen the bones happen not to unite, because they have been often\r\nopened, and often moved, the method of cure is obvious; for they may\r\nunite. If the fracture be of long standing, the limb must be extended,\r\nto create a fresh injury; the bones must be separated from one another\r\nby the hand, that their surfaces may be roughened by rubbing against\r\neach other, and if there be any fat substance, it may be abraded, and\r\nthe whole of it become as it were recent: great care, however, must\r\nbe taken not to wound tendons or muscles. Then it must be bathed with\r\na decoction of pomegranate bark in wine; and the same mixed with the\r\nwhite of eggs, must be applied to it; on the third day it must be\r\nopened, and bathed with a decoction of the vervains abovementioned:\r\nwhich must be repeated on the fifth day, and splints put round it;\r\nthe other steps, both before and after, which I directed already,\r\nmust be taken in the same manner. However, sometimes the bones unite\r\nobliquely(21); and thus the limb becomes both shorter and deformed,\r\nand if the ends are pretty sharp, continual prickings are felt: for\r\nthis reason the bones ought to be fractured again, and put in a proper\r\ndirection. It is done in this manner. The limb is fomented with plenty\r\nof hot water, and rubbed over with liquid cerate and extended; in the\r\nmean time, the physician handling the bones, the callus being yet\r\ntended, separates them by his hands, and forces the part that projects,\r\ninto its place: and if that is not effectual, on that side, to which\r\nthe bone inclines, he puts a regula wrapped up in wool; and by thus\r\nbinding it up brings it to a habit of lodging in its former place.\r\n\r\nSometimes also, though the bones have united as they should do, too\r\nlarge a callus grows upon them; and therefore the part is swelled. When\r\nthis happens, the limb must be rubbed gently for a long time, with oil,\r\nsalt and nitre, and bathed with plenty of salt water; a discutient\r\nmalagma must be applied; and a tight bandage put on; and the patient\r\nmust eat herbage, and take vomits; by which course, the callus is\r\nreduced together with the flesh. Some good is done by an application\r\nof mustard and a fig upon another limb, till it corrode a little, and\r\nderive the matter to that part. When the tumour is lessened by these\r\nmeans, the person may return to his ordinary course of life.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. XI.\r\n\r\nOF LUXATIONS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThus far then we have treated of fractures. Now the bones are\r\ndislocated in two ways. For sometimes those that are joined together,\r\nseparate from each other, as when the broad bone of the scapula\r\nrecedes from the humerus(22), and in the fore-arm the radius from\r\nthe cubitus, and in the leg, the tibia from the fibula, and sometimes\r\nin leaping the heel-bone from the ancle; which last, however, seldom\r\nhappens. Sometimes the articulations are displaced. I shall speak first\r\nof the former.\r\n\r\nWhen such an accident happens, the part is immediately hollow, and\r\nby pressing upon it with the finger one feels a cavity. After that,\r\na violent inflammation comes on; and particularly in the ancle; for\r\ngenerally it occasions fevers and gangrenes, and either convulsions, or\r\ncontractions, which draw the head down upon the shoulders. To avoid\r\nwhich, the same method must be followed here, as in injuries of the\r\nmoveable bones. And whenever it happens, the medicines prescribed\r\nbefore must be laid on these parts to remove the pain and tumour: for\r\nbones once separated in this manner never come together again; and\r\nthough some degree of comeliness be attainable in the part, yet it is\r\nof no use(23).\r\n\r\nBut the lower jaw and the vertebræ, and all the joints, though they be\r\nsecured by strong ligaments, are luxated by the force of a blow, or\r\nwhen the ligaments are either ruptured, or some way weakened; and more\r\neasily in children or lads, than in those that are more robust. And\r\nthey slip out forward and backward, and inward and outward; some of\r\nthem in all these ways, others in particular ways. And there are some\r\ngeneral signs belonging to all, others peculiar to each one: for there\r\nis always a tumour in that part, to which the bone is propelled, and a\r\ncavity in that from whence it recedes. Now these marks are common to\r\nthem all; the others peculiar to the several bones will be mentioned,\r\nwhen I speak of each case distinctly.\r\n\r\nBut though all the articulations may be dislocated, they cannot be\r\nall replaced; for the head is never reduced, nor a vertebra in the\r\nspine, nor a jaw-bone, which being out on both sides, has raised an\r\ninflammation before it could be returned. Again, those that slip out\r\nfrom the fault of the ligaments, when they are forced into their\r\nplaces, give way again. And those that have been dislocated in\r\nchildhood, and have not been reduced, grow less than the rest: and the\r\nflesh of all these that are not in their place, is decayed, and more so\r\nin the member nearest to it, than in one beyond it. For instance, if\r\nthe humerus is not in its place, the arm wastes more than the fore-arm,\r\nand that more than the hand. Then according to the situations, and the\r\nnature of the accidents, there is left either more or less use of the\r\nlimb; and the more use remains of it, the less it is wasted.\r\n\r\nNow whatever is dislocated should be reduced before an inflammation\r\nbegin. If that has already seized it, till it cease, it must not be\r\nmeddled with; after its removal, trial must be made in such limbs\r\nas are reducible. A great deal depends upon the habit both of the\r\nbody and the ligaments: for if the body be slender, or humid, or if\r\nthe ligaments be weak, the bone is more quickly reduced; but it is\r\nboth more liable to dislocation, and is less firmly held after it\r\nis reduced(24). Bodies of the contrary qualities hold it faster\r\nin its place; but when once forced out, admit of its return with\r\ndifficulty. It is proper to alleviate the inflammation by applying\r\nsordid wool squeezed out of vinegar; and if the misfortune be in a\r\nstrong articulation, to abstain from food for three, and sometimes even\r\nfive days; to drink warm water till the thirst be gone; to observe\r\nthese rules more strictly in luxations of those bones, that are held\r\nby strong large muscles; and much more so if a fever has ensued; on\r\nthe fifth day to foment with hot water; and taking away the wool, to\r\napply cerate made of Cyprine oil, with the addition of nitre, till the\r\ninflammation be entirely removed. Then it is proper to use friction\r\nto the limb; to take food of good juices, wine in moderate quantity;\r\nand by this time, to make some use of the limb: because motion, as it\r\nis extremely hurtful in pain, so it is very salutary when the pain\r\nis removed. These observations are general; I shall now treat of the\r\nparticular cases.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. XII.\r\n\r\nOF A LUXATED MAXILLA.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn a dislocation of the lower jaw it is pushed forward, but sometimes\r\non one side, sometimes on both. If on one side, it inclines together\r\nwith the chin to the contrary side, the teeth do not answer to each\r\nother, but the canine teeth below are opposite to the incisores: if\r\non both sides, the chin leaves its place, and is protruded to the\r\nexternal part; and the lower teeth come farther out than the upper;\r\nand the muscles of the temples appear tense. The patient, as soon as\r\npossible, must be placed in a seat in such a manner, that an assistant\r\nmay secure his head behind; or he may be seated near a wall, putting a\r\nhard leather cushion between the wall and his head, and let his head\r\nbe pressed upon the cushion by an assistant, that it may be kept the\r\nsteadier; then the thumbs of the physician being wrapped up with linen\r\ncloths, or rollers, that they may not slip, must be introduced into\r\nhis mouth; and the fingers must be applied externally. When the maxilla\r\nis firmly grasped, if the luxation be on one side, the chin must be\r\nshaken, and brought towards the throat; then at the same time his head\r\nmust be held, and the chin being raised, the maxilla forced into its\r\nplace, and the mouth shut; and all this must be done almost in the same\r\ninstant. But if the luxation be on both sides, the same method must\r\nbe taken; but the jaw-bone must be forced back equally on both sides.\r\nWhen the bone is replaced, if the case was attended with a pain of the\r\neyes and neck, blood must be taken from the arm. And as liquid food at\r\nfirst is proper for all persons, whose bones have been dislocated, so\r\nparticularly in this circumstance; where even frequent speaking, by the\r\nmotion of the mouth, hurts the nerves of the temples(25).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. XIII.\r\n\r\nOF A LUXATION OF THE HEAD.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the first part of this book, I have already observed, that the head\r\nis secured upon the neck by two processes received into two depressions\r\nof the upper vertebra. These processes are sometimes dislocated toward\r\nthe posterior part; the consequence of which is, that the nerves below\r\nthe occiput are extended, the chin is fixed upon the breast, and the\r\npatient can neither drink, nor speak, and sometimes discharges his\r\nsemen involuntarily. Such patients die very quickly. I judged it\r\nnecessary to mention this case, not because there is any cure for\r\nit; but that it might be known by its symptoms, and if any should\r\nlose a friend in this way, they might not think it was for want of a\r\nphysician.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. XIV.\r\n\r\nOF A LUXATION IN THE SPINE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe same misfortune attends those, whose vertebræ of the spine are\r\nluxated. For this cannot happen, unless both the medulla, which passes\r\nthrough the middle, and the two membranes, that go through the two\r\nprocesses on the sides, as also the ligaments, that secure them, be\r\nruptured. They are dislocated both backward, and forward; both above\r\nand below the transverse septum. As they slip the one way or the\r\nother, there will be either a swelling or a cavity behind. If this\r\nhappens above the septum, the hands become paralytick, a vomiting\r\nor convulsions follow, the breath is oppressed, and a violent pain\r\nand deafness ensue. If below the septum, the thighs are paralytick,\r\nthe urine is suppressed, and sometimes it even flows involuntarily.\r\nThough a person does not in such cases die so quickly as where the\r\nhead is luxated, yet it commonly happens within three days; for what\r\nHippocrates has directed in a vertebra luxated externally, that the\r\npatient must be laid prone, and extended, and then a person ought\r\nto stand upon him with his heel and force it in, must be understood\r\nof those, that are but partially displaced, not of these, that are\r\nentirely luxated; for sometimes a weakness of the ligaments causes a\r\nvertebra to protuberate forwards, though it be not dislocated: this is\r\nnot mortal. But it is not possible to force it back from the internal\r\npart. If any vertebra be reduced from the external side, it generally\r\nreturns again, unless, which is very rare, the tone of the nerves be\r\nrestored(26).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. XV.\r\n\r\nOF A LUXATION OF THE HUMERUS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe humerus slips sometimes into the axilla, sometimes forward. If it\r\nhas fallen into the arm-pit, the cubitus recedes from the body, and\r\ncannot be brought upward with the humerus to the ear of the same side;\r\nalso that arm is longer than the other: if forward, the upper part of\r\nthe fore-arm is extended, but not to its full length; and the cubitus\r\nis moved with more difficulty forward than backward.\r\n\r\nTherefore if the humerus has fallen into the arm-pit, and the patient\r\nbe young, or of a lax habit, so that the ligaments are weak, it is\r\nsufficient to place him in a seat; and to order one assistant to draw\r\nback gently the head of the broad bone of the scapula, and another to\r\nextend the fore-arm; while the physician himself sitting behind, with\r\nhis knee under the patient’s arm-pit, forces the humerus upwards, and\r\nat the same time presses the scapula with one hand, while he pushes the\r\ncubit to the side with the other.\r\n\r\nBut if the patient be of a large stature, or the ligaments more robust,\r\na wooden spatha is necessary of the thickness of two fingers, and so\r\nlong as to reach from the arm-pit to the fingers. In the top of it, is\r\na small round head a little hollowed; that it may receive some part of\r\nthe head of the humerus; and in three places at due distances there\r\nare two holes made for the admission of soft straps. This spatha being\r\nwrapt up in a roller, that it may hurt the less, is applied from the\r\nfore-arm to the arm pit, in such a manner, that the head of it is put\r\nunder the axilla; then it is tied to the arm by its straps, in one\r\nplace a little below the head of the humerus, another a little above\r\nthe elbow, and the third above the hand; to which purpose the distances\r\nof the holes are then also to be adapted. The arm being thus tied up\r\nis put over a step of a ladder, so high, that the patient cannot stand\r\nupon the ground; and at the same time his body is suffered to sink on\r\none side, and his arm kept extended on the other; the effect is, that\r\nthe head of the humerus, being impelled by the head of the spatha, is\r\nforced into its place, sometimes with a crack, sometimes without it. It\r\nappears from Hippocrates alone, that there are many other methods; but\r\nnone of them has been more approved by experience than this.\r\n\r\nBut if the humerus is luxated forward, the patient must be laid on his\r\nback, and a roller, or strap put round the middle of the arm-pit, and\r\nthe ends of it delivered to one assistant behind the patient’s head,\r\nand his fore-arm to another; then the first must be ordered to extend\r\nthe strap, and the other the fore-arm; and the physician must thrust\r\nback the patient’s head with his left hand, and with his right raise\r\nthe cubitus together with the humerus, and force the bone into its\r\nplace; which in this case is more easily reduced than in the former.\r\n\r\nWhen the humerus is replaced, wool must be put under the arm-pit; that\r\nif the bone was in the interior part, it may prevent its returning; if\r\nforward, that it may however be more conveniently rolled up. Then the\r\nroller being first carried under the arm-pit, ought to surround the\r\nhead of the bone, and passing over the breast to the other arm-pit, and\r\nfrom that to the scapulæ, and back again to the head of the _luxated_\r\nhumerus, it must be carried round in this manner several times, till\r\nthe head of the humerus be well secured. The humerus being thus bound\r\nup is better fixed, if it be drawn close to the side, and tied down to\r\nit with a roller.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. XVI.\r\n\r\nOF A LUXATION OF THE CUBITUS.\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom what has been said in the first part of this book, it may be\r\nunderstood, that three bones meet together at the elbow, the humerus,\r\nradius, and cubitus. If the cubitus, which is fixed to the humerus,\r\nseparates from it, the radius, which is contiguous to it, is sometimes\r\ndislocated, and sometimes remains firm. Now the cubitus may be luxated\r\nin all the four different ways. If it be displaced forward, the\r\nfore-arm is extended, and cannot be bent; if backward, the fore-arm is\r\nbent, cannot be extended, and is shorter than the other; sometimes it\r\nbrings on a fever and bilious vomiting; if externally, or internally,\r\nthe fore-arm is stretched, but is a little bent to that part, from\r\nwhence the bone has receded.\r\n\r\nWhatever species it be, the method of reduction is the same (and not\r\nonly in the cubitus, but in all the larger limbs, which are joined in\r\nthe articulation by a long process) to extend both limbs different\r\nways, till there be a void space between the bones; and then to thrust\r\nthe luxated bone from that side, into which it has prolapsed, to the\r\ncontrary. However the methods of extension are various according to the\r\nstrength of the ligaments, and the position of the luxated bones. And\r\nsometimes the hands alone are used, sometimes other means.\r\n\r\nTherefore if the cubitus is displaced forward, it is sufficient for\r\nit to be extended by two hands, sometimes assisted by two straps;\r\nthen some round body must be put into the bend of the elbow, and upon\r\nthat, the cubitus is to be suddenly forced towards the humerus. But in\r\nthe other cases the best method is so extend the fore-arm in the same\r\nmanner, as was directed in a fractured humerus, and then to reduce the\r\nbones.\r\n\r\nThe remaining part of the cure is the same as in the other luxations;\r\nonly this must be sooner, and more frequently opened, also more\r\nplentifully fomented with hot water, and rubbed longer with oil, and\r\nnitre, and salt. For the cubitus, whether it remain displaced, or be\r\nreduced, is more quickly surrounded by a callus than another joint, and\r\nif this grows, while the arm is at rest, it afterwards prevents its\r\nflexure.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. XVII.\r\n\r\nOF A LUXATED HAND.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe hand too may be displaced in all the four directions. If it slips\r\nbackward, the fingers cannot be extended; if forward, they cannot be\r\nbent; if on either side, the hand is turned to the opposite, that is,\r\neither toward the thumb, or the little finger, and may be replaced\r\nwithout much difficulty. The hand and fore-arm should be extended on\r\nsomething, that is hard and will not give way, the hand being prone,\r\nif the luxation was to the posterior part; and supine, if forward; if\r\ninternally, or externally, it should be laid on one side. When the\r\nligaments are sufficiently stretched, if the luxation was lateral, it\r\nmust be repelled to the contrary side by the hands: but where it was\r\nforward, or backward, some hard body is to be put upon it, and pressed\r\nupon the prominent bone by the hand, which additional force pushes it\r\nmore easily into its place.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. XVIII.\r\n\r\nOF LUXATIONS IN THE PALM.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe bones also in the palm are sometimes dislocated, and that either\r\nforward, or backward. For they cannot be luxated laterally by reason\r\nof the resistance from the parallel bones on each side. There is only\r\none indication of it, which is common to them all: a tumour in that\r\npart, to which the bone comes, and a cavity in the other, from which it\r\nrecedes. But the bone being well pressed by a finger, returns without\r\nextension to its place.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. XIX.\r\n\r\nOF LUXATED FINGERS.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the fingers there are as many different cases, and the same signs,\r\nas in the hands. But an equal degree of force is not necessary in their\r\nextension; because the _several_ bones are shorter, and the ligaments\r\nless strong. They ought only to be extended upon a table, when the\r\nluxation is forward or backward; and then compressed with the palm of\r\nthe hand that thus the finger may be(27) restored to the place from\r\nwhence it slipped.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. XX.\r\n\r\nOF A LUXATION OF THE FEMUR.\r\n\r\n\r\nHaving treated of the humerus(28), what I said there may seem to\r\nsuffice for the lower extremities; for there is some similitude in this\r\ncase between the femur, and humerus, the tibia, and cubitus, the foot\r\nand hand. However something must be said in particular about these.\r\n\r\nThe femur is protruded in all the four ways; most frequently to the\r\ninternal part, next externally, very rarely forward, or backward. If it\r\nbe luxated internally, the leg is longer and turned round externally\r\nmore than the other; for the toes point outward. If to the external\r\npart, it is shorter and bowed inward, and the foot turns the same way;\r\nthe heel in walking does not touch the ground, but the person rests\r\nupon the extremity of the sole of the foot; and in this case, the leg\r\nsustains the superior part of the body better than in the former, and\r\nless needs the help of a staff. If forward, the leg cannot be bent, and\r\nbeing extended is as long at the heel as the other: but the toes are\r\nturned less inward; also the pain is most violent in this case; and the\r\nurine very liable to be suppressed: when the inflammation together with\r\nthe pain have ceased, such patients walk pretty well, and their foot is\r\nstraight. If the luxation be backward, the leg cannot be extended; and\r\nis shorter; also in standing, the heel does not reach the ground.\r\n\r\nBut there is a great danger attending the femur, that it be either\r\ndifficult to reduce, or slip out again after it is replaced: some\r\naffirm it always comes out again; but Hippocrates, and Diocles,\r\nand Philotimus, and Nileus, and Heraclides the Tarentine, very\r\ncelebrated authors, have affirmed, that they have made a perfect cure.\r\nNeither would Hippocrates, Andreas, Nileus, Nymphodorus, Protarchus,\r\nHeraclides, and a certain artificer too, have contrived so great a\r\nvariety of machines for extending the femur in this case, if it were to\r\nno purpose. But as this is a false opinion, so on the other hand it is\r\ntrue, that the ligaments and muscles there being very strong, if they\r\nretain their natural firmness, they will hardly admit of a reduction;\r\nif they do not, they do not hold it fast, when reduced.\r\n\r\nTherefore trial must be made, and if the limb be but tender, it is\r\nsufficient to make an extension by one strap at the groin, and another\r\nat the knee; if it be muscular, the extension will be better made by\r\ntying these straps to strong sticks; and then putting the lower ends\r\nof the sticks against a fulcrum, and pulling the upper ends with both\r\nhands. The extension of the limb is still more strong upon a bench,\r\nthat has axes at both ends, to which these straps are tied; which being\r\nturned as in a wine-press, by persevering, they will not only extend,\r\nbut even break the ligaments and muscles. Now the patient must be laid\r\nupon this bench, either prone or supine, or on one side, so that the\r\npart, into which the bone has slipped, be always uppermost, and that,\r\nfrom which it has receded, lowermost. When the ligaments are extended,\r\nif the bone is luxated forward, some round body must be put upon the\r\ngroin; and the knee must suddenly be drawn towards the body, in the\r\nsame manner, and for the same reason, as is done in the arm; and if the\r\nfemur gives way to the flexion, it is reduced.\r\n\r\nBut in the other cases, where the bones have receded a little from\r\neach other, the physician ought to force back the prominent part; and\r\nan assistant to push the hip in a contrary direction. When the bone is\r\nreduced, there is nothing different required in the treatment, except\r\nconfining the patient longer to his bed; lest if the femur be moved,\r\nwhile the ligaments are too lax, it may slip out again. However it may\r\nbe secured by keeping the middle or upper part of the joint in some\r\ncanaliculus(29).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. XXI.\r\n\r\nOF A LUXATION OF THE KNEE.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is very well known, that the knee slips inward, outward, and\r\nbackward. Most authors have written, that it is not displaced forward.\r\nAnd that may appear very probable; as in that place the patella is\r\nopposed to it, and likewise keeps in the head of the tibia. But Meges\r\nhas given an instance of a person cured by him, where the luxation was\r\nforward.\r\n\r\nIn these cases the ligaments may be extended by the same means, which\r\nI recited in the femur. And where the bone is luxated backward, it is\r\nreduced in the same manner, by some round body applied to the ham, and\r\ndrawing up the leg. In the other cases the hands are only to be used,\r\nand then the bones are at the same time forced different ways.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. XXII.\r\n\r\nOF A LUXATED ANCLE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe ancle is luxated in all directions. When it is inward, the sole of\r\nthe foot is turned outward. When the contrary case to this happens,\r\nthere is also the contrary symptom. But if it be luxated forward, the\r\nbroad tendon behind is hard, and tense; and the foot turns downward. If\r\nbackward, the heel is almost hid, and the sole of the foot is enlarged.\r\nThis luxation is reduced by the hands; the foot and leg being first\r\nextended different ways. And in this case also the patient must be kept\r\nlonger in bed; lest the ancle, which sustains the whole body, yield\r\nbeneath its load, and be forced out again before the ligaments have\r\nrecovered their strength. And at first low shoes must be used, lest the\r\nbinding hurt the ancle.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. XXIII.\r\n\r\nOF LUXATIONS IN THE SOLES OF THE FEET.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe bones in the soles of the feet are luxated in the same manner as\r\nthose in the hands; and are reduced by the same methods; only it is\r\nnecessary to put a roller round the heel; lest as the middle part and\r\nextremity of the sole require to be bound, the ancle being left free,\r\nmay receive the redundant matter, and thus come to suppuration.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. XXIV.\r\n\r\nOF LUXATED TOES.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the toes there is nothing else required, than what has been directed\r\nbefore in the fingers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. XXV.\r\n\r\nOF LUXATIONS ATTENDED WITH A WOUND.\r\n\r\n\r\nThese are the methods to be taken, when the bones have been displaced\r\nwithout a wound; but they are often dislocated, and the part wounded at\r\nthe same time; and here the danger is great, and so much the greater,\r\nas the limb is larger, and the ligaments, or muscles that hold it,\r\nstronger; and therefore, from the arm and thigh bones there is danger\r\nof death: and if the bones are reduced, there is no hope; and yet when\r\nthey are not replaced, there is also some danger. In both, the event\r\nis the more to be feared, the nearer the wound is to the articulation.\r\nFor Hippocrates has asserted, that no bone could in this case be\r\nsafely reduced, except the fingers and toes, and the bones of the feet\r\nand hands; and that even here great caution must be used, lest it\r\nsuddenly destroy the patient. Some have reduced both arms and legs;\r\nand to prevent gangrenes and convulsions (which in such cases often\r\nterminate in speedy death) they let blood from the arm. But not even a\r\nfinger (where, as the malady, so also the danger is least) ought to be\r\nreduced, either while there is an inflammation, or afterwards, when the\r\nbones have continued long luxated. And farther, if after the reduction\r\nof the bone, convulsions come on, it must be immediately put out again.\r\n\r\nNow every member that is at once wounded and dislocated, and continues\r\nunreduced, ought to lie in the posture easiest to the patient; provided\r\nit neither be moved nor hang down. In every case of this kind the cure\r\nis much promoted by long fasting; and then the use of those methods\r\nprescribed before. In fractured bones, where there is a wound, if the\r\nnaked bone project, it will always prevent its healing; therefore, the\r\nprominent part must be cut away, and dry lint applied, and medicines\r\nnot greasy; till the greatest degree of soundness attainable in such a\r\ncase be restored; for it both leaves a weakness behind it, and the part\r\nis covered with a thin cicatrix, which must of necessity be ever after\r\ngreatly exposed to injuries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTES\r\n\r\nTO\r\n\r\nBOOK I.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. _Their gods._ Though Æsculapius lived so near to the time of the\r\nTrojan war, yet the Greeks knew very little about him. The superstition\r\nof those times gave him a place among the gods: and as he was adored\r\nunder the character of the genius of physick, it came at last to be\r\ndoubted whether he was ever a mortal. This blind devotion, however,\r\nproduced one happy consequence: his priests were obliged, for their\r\nown interest, to make themselves masters of all the physic that was\r\nknown in that country, that they might be qualified to give advice to\r\nthe people, who applied to them. Their prescriptions passed for the\r\nsuggestions of the god; their cures for miraculous. But both diseases\r\nand remedies were carefully recorded.----Strabo tells us, that from\r\nthese registers in the temple of Æsculapius at Cos, Hippocrates formed\r\nhis plan for a proper diet.----_Strabon. Geograph. lib. 14. p. 657.\r\nEdit. Casaub._\r\n\r\n2. _Immortal gods._) That this was really the opinion of the\r\nancients, may be seen by many passages in Homer’s poems, where he\r\nmentions Jupiter punishing wicked nations by diseases, as well as\r\nfamine, wars, and other calamities.\r\n\r\n3. _Principles._) Some of the ancient philosophers maintained, that\r\nthe human body, as well as the whole material system, was composed of\r\nfour principles or elements, viz. fire, air, earth, and water.\r\n\r\n4. _Vessels_, in the original, _vena_; which is used by our author\r\nas a general term for arteries and veins. In this place it is evident\r\nhe means arteries; for mentioning the same opinion again, page 16, he\r\nsays, _At si sanguis in arterias transfusus_; and he often speaks of\r\nthe motion of the veins, where, it is plain, he intends the pulsation\r\nof the arteries. _Arteria_ he uses to signify the wind-pipe, and\r\nlikewise the sanguiferous arteries, as in chap. 1. of book 4. _Circa\r\nguttur venae grandes, quae sphagitides nominantur; item arteriæ, quas\r\ncarotidas vocant._\r\n\r\n5. _Distribution of the same._) The word in the original is _digero_,\r\nwhich, by the modern physicians, is generally applied to the digestion\r\nof the aliment in the stomach. But that is what our author never\r\nintends by it. _Digero_ he uses in three different senses; 1st, for the\r\ndistribution of the aliment from the stomach (after its concoction)\r\nto all the other parts of the body, which appears to be his meaning\r\nhere: 2dly, for any evacuation made by the pores of the skin, as\r\n_sudore digerit_ in the end of the ninth chapter of this book: 3dly,\r\nfor discussing any collection of humour, so as to prevent its coming to\r\nsuppuration; _vel avertenda concurrens eo materia_, _vel digerenda_,\r\n_vel ad maturitatem perducenda est: si priora contigerunt_, _nihil\r\npraeterea necessarium est_. Lib. vii. c. 2. ad fin. p. 408. Unless we\r\nrestrain the meaning of this last passage to discussing by the skin,\r\nwhich would bring it under the second sense.\r\n\r\n6. _Asperity._) Ten of the most ancient editions mentioned by\r\nMorgagni[ID] read _contactum_; but as that seems to convey no\r\nconvenient sense, others prefer _contractum_, which is found in one\r\nof the manuscripts, and suppose it to mean asperity, a sense which\r\nit is not found to bear elsewhere; and therefore, Constantine boldly\r\nenough substitutes _confractum_, which he thinks agreeable to this\r\ninterpretation. The same reason may, perhaps, have led him to that\r\nalteration, as induced the others to explain _contractum_ by asperity,\r\nthat it might stand in opposition to smoothness. For my own part,\r\nthough _confractus_ is not found in any other classic, yet I have given\r\nthis translation, because I can find no other sense of the place, as it\r\nnow stands. If I durst offer my own conjecture, ἀπόζυμος γαστὴρI would\r\nrather chuse to read _anfractum_, which, I think, is applicable to the\r\nwindings of some of the internal parts.\r\n\r\n  [ID] Ep. iii. p. 53.\r\n\r\n7. _Lippitudo_ is used by Celsus, and the more ancient Latins in the\r\nsame sense as the Greek term _Ophthalmia_.\r\n\r\n8. _Abdomen._) The word in the original is _uterus_, which our author\r\ngenerally uses for the cavity of the abdomen.\r\n\r\n9. _Indeed may be opened._) The text in Almeloveen and Linden runs\r\nthus, _Nam ne uterum quidem ut nihilominus aerem contineat_, &c. The\r\nparticle _ne_ is not in the older copies or the MS. of Morgagni[IE],\r\nand as it spoils the sense, I have omitted it. The same older copies\r\nread _qui minus ad rem pertineat_, instead of _ut nihilominus aerem\r\ncontineat_; but as the first can bear no sense at all in this place,\r\nand the other has not the elegance of Celsus, I have taken no notice\r\nof either; and as the connection is perfect without any addition, I\r\nsuspect both to have crept in from the margin.\r\n\r\n  [IE] Ep. vii. p. 187.\r\n\r\n10. _Praecordia._) This word frequently occurs in Celsus; and he\r\nseems to use it in two senses: 1st, For the cavity of the thorax,\r\nas lib. 4. c. 1. _At sub corde atque pulmone transversum ex valida\r\nmembrana est septum, quod è praecordiis uterum diducit._ 2dly, For\r\nthe hypochondria; for which see several passages in the first eight\r\nchapters of the second book, where he considers the symptoms of\r\ndistempers from the external appearance of the præcordia; by which\r\nword, in those passages, he translates the Greek term ὑποχονδρίον in\r\nHippocrates; the derivation of which demonstrates it to be below the\r\nCartilago Xiphoides.\r\n\r\n11. _Quantity of flesh._) I shall not trouble the reader with several\r\nvarious and opposite opinions of this case, by different commentators;\r\nit will be sufficient to recite the opinion of Morgagni[IF] (which\r\nappears the only probable one) and the reasons with which he supports\r\nit. In his anatomical lectures he explained it as an inverted uterus,\r\nwhich he says resembles nothing more than flesh, and is quickly seized\r\nwith a gangrene, for the reasons given by Ruysch.

Chir.\r\n10. and thus[IG] Celsus, in the description of a gangrene, mentions\r\n_siccam et aridam carnem_; and Boerhaave says, an inverted uterus is\r\nseized with a gangrene in three hours after its inversion, which agrees\r\nwith _intra paueas horas_ in this place.----The ingenious author,\r\nfirst mentioned, confirms this explanation by a case that occurred to\r\na surgeon, who, struck with the novelty of it, came immediately to ask\r\nhis opinion: upon his shewing the surgeon Ruysch’s delineation of an\r\ninverted uterus, he confessed it to be perfectly similar.----Morgagni\r\nadvised him to run back and replace it immediately, which he did in an\r\nhour after its inversion, and the lady was cured.\r\n\r\n  [IF] Ep. iv. p. 89.\r\n\r\n  [IG] Lib. 5. c. 26. p. 301.\r\n\r\n12. _Nervus._) Though it might be doubted, whether the ancients\r\ncomprehended under this word, what is now properly called a nerve,\r\nyet, it is certain they used it for a tendon, or ligament; which so\r\nevidently appears in many passages of Celsus, particularly the eighth\r\nbook, that it is quite superfluous to instance any single example.\r\nAnd this is agreeable to the signification of the Greek word νευ̃ρον,\r\na chord or string; and thus Hippocrates says, “The nerves are dry\r\nand void of any cavity, and grow to the bone, and have most of their\r\nnourishment from thence; they are nourished also from the flesh, and\r\ntheir colour and strength is in a middle degree between bone and\r\nflesh.” Hippocrat. Opera, sect. 4: lib. de loc. in homin. p. 409.\r\nad finem. That I might not seem to determine, what may be thought\r\ndoubtful, I have generally retained the author’s term _nerve_, and\r\nleft the application to the reader’s judgment; but in some places,\r\nparticularly in the eighth book, where the meaning was very evident,\r\nand the word νευ̃ρον_nerve_ would have been harsh to an English reader,\r\nI have rendered it tendon, or ligament, as the connection appeared to\r\nrequire.\r\n\r\n13. _Another loose._) The word in the original is _fluens_, that is a\r\ndisorder attended with some discharge.\r\n\r\n14. Our author means here the ἀχμὴ of a disease, after which it\r\nincreases no more.\r\n\r\n15. _A dinner also._) Mercurialis conjectures that the custom among\r\nthe Romans of making but one set meal in the day, arose from their\r\nspending so much time in cleaning their bodies, and going through the\r\nseveral processes at the baths, that they had hardly time left even for\r\none meal; considering that besides all these operations, they had each\r\nhis own private business to transact, and their bathing was too sacred\r\nto be omitted. Hieron. Mercurial. de Art. Gymnast. lib. i. cap. 11.\r\n\r\n16. _Iatroalipta._) This is a Greek word, and signifies _a physician\r\nthat anoints_. There was always one or more of these attending a\r\ngymnasium, to whose province belonged every thing that related to\r\nunction. To their care was committed the strength and complexion of\r\nthe body; thus Cicero in an epistle to Lentulus, says, _Sed vellem non\r\nsolum salutis meae, quemadmodum medici, sed etiam ut aliptae, virium\r\net coloris rationem babere voluissent_. It is probable, that at their\r\nfirst institution, they were acquainted with the nature and effects of\r\ntheir operations on human bodies; and according to Plato, de Legibus,\r\nlib. xi. they were either physicians, or in many things equal to them.\r\nBut Galen complains, that in his time they were ignorant. For a more\r\nparticular account, see Mercurial. de Art. Gymnast. lib. i. cap. 12.\r\n\r\n17. _Sometimes the warm bath_, &c.) No practice was ever more\r\nuniversally followed, than that of bathing among the ancients. The\r\nfirst design of it was certainly the preservation of health; but, as\r\nriches and luxury increased among both Greeks and Romans, the edifices\r\nfor this purpose grew proportionably more elegant and sumptuous. The\r\nconstruction of baths and their several appurtenances must have been\r\nso well known, when in use, that it is not to be wondered we have so\r\nimperfect accounts of them transmitted to us. Without entering into\r\nany of the disputes about the form or use of several of their parts,\r\nI shall subjoin what seems to be generally agreed to by all, and may\r\nserve to explain any passages in our author which have relation to them.\r\n\r\nIn the baths there were five apartments--One, called _Tepidarium_,\r\nwas a room close all round, and rendered tepid by dry vapours from a\r\nfire. Persons staid here so long as to rarify their humours, that they\r\nmight not go unprepared into the hotter rooms. The _Calidarium_, or\r\n_Laconicum_, was in all things similar to the foregoing, only the heat\r\nwas greater. Some affirm, that in both these apartments there were\r\nvessels of water, of the same temperature with their air. Next followed\r\nthe _Solium_, where was the hot bath. People sat here, sometimes,\r\nwithout going into the bath, and had water poured over them, as Celsus\r\nin several places prescribes. The _Baptisterium_, or _Piscina_, was\r\nthe receptacle for cold water, for bathing and swimming in. There was\r\nalso an apartment called _Frigidarium_, concerning which there is a\r\ndispute, whether it contained water or not; Mercurialis says, ‘Some\r\nhave imagined there was water here for those who were fond of swimming;\r\nbut there is no mention of water in authors.’--He adds, ‘that it was\r\ncontrived for those that came immediately from the _Tepidarium_ and\r\n_Calidarium_, and wanted to enjoy a cool air.’ Pliny[IH] the younger\r\nmentions a _Frigidarium_ in a bath at his villa, where there was water\r\nfor swimming in; but this may have been a new mode, and not known in\r\nCelsus’s time. Whether this apartment contained water or not, I shall\r\nnot determine; but it would appear from authors, that either the air or\r\nwater here was of a mild temperature, not quite cold, nor yet so warm\r\nas the _Tepidarium_. To[II] these several parts were subservient; the\r\n_Aquarium_, in which a large reservoir was built for holding water\r\nbrought from the aqueducts and elsewhere.--The _Vasarium_, where the\r\nnecessary vessels were placed, and where the water was heated; this\r\nstood above the _Hypocaustum_, or stove.\r\n\r\n  [IH] Plin. epist. 6. lib. v.\r\n\r\n  [II] Vitruv. lib. v. c. 10.\r\n\r\nSeneca[IJ] has shown us of how great importance the Romans esteemed the\r\nbaths in the time of the republic, when he observes, ‘What pleasure\r\nthere would be in going into the baths, which a person knew to be\r\ntempered by the hand of Cato in his edileship, or Fabius Maximus, or\r\none of the Cornelii--for, says he, this function the most noble ediles\r\nperformed, of inspecting those places frequented by the people, and\r\nrequiring cleanliness and a convenient and salutary temperature; not\r\nsuch as has been lately brought into use, in which the heat is so\r\nviolent, that one would imagine a slave convicted of some crime were\r\ncondemned to that punishment.’\r\n\r\n  [IJ] Senec. epist. lxxxvi.\r\n\r\nThese several parts of the baths were variously used, according to\r\nthe case of the person, and the intention pursued. Where no epithet\r\nis added to the bath in the text, it will appear from the connection,\r\ngenerally, that the hot bath is to be understood. For any further\r\nparticulars relating to the baths, see Mercurial. de Art. Gymnast. lib.\r\ni. c. 10.\r\n\r\n18. _Gravedoes._) I have here retained the original word, because\r\nwe have no one English term which will answer to it. See its symptoms\r\nenumerated, lib. iv. c. 4.\r\n\r\n19. _In one that has laboured little._) According to the reading\r\nof Almeloveen and Linden, which is, _In eo, qui minus laboravit, et\r\nbene concoxit, remissior: in eo, qui assuetus est, et minus concoxit,\r\namplior_, Celsus gives a precept contrary to what he had directed\r\nbefore, p. 22. l. 2. _Qui parum concoxit, quiescere debet._ In justice,\r\ntherefore, to our author, I restore with Morgagni[IK] the old reading,\r\n_In eo, qui minus laboravit, et bene concoxit, amplior: in eo, qui\r\nfatigatus est, et minus concoxit, remissior_.\r\n\r\n  [IK] Ep. 6. p. 148.\r\n\r\n20. _Salt fish, salsamentum._) By this is generally understood fish\r\nsalted and dried (resembling our dried ling), for in several ancient\r\nauthors it is ordered to be macerated before boiling; and it is often\r\nmentioned as made of fish: but it would appear from Strabo[IL], that\r\nthe same name was also given to flesh cured in like manner; for he\r\nmentions a ταρχεία, or _salsamentum_, made of pork, amongst the\r\nSequani, which was brought to the Roman market.\r\n\r\n  [IL] Strabon. lib. iv. p. 192. See Athenæus--A. Terent. in Adelph.\r\n\r\n21. _Sexes._) Our author here proposes the difference arising from\r\nthe sexes, as one of the subjects to be treated of, but no notice is\r\ntaken of it in the subsequent part of the chapter: so that this word\r\nmust either have been interpolated, or, as Constantine observes, Celsus\r\nmust have forgot it, (which is not probable,) or his observations upon\r\nthat article may be lost, by the carelessness of transcribers.\r\n\r\n22. _Frequent yawning._) As this whole paragraph relates to\r\npeople that are fatigued, it renders the old reading more probable,\r\n_fatigatio_, instead of _oscitatio_, especially as it follows, that a\r\nchange of labour relieves from fatigue; unless we reckon yawning as\r\none of the symptoms of lassitude; Morgagni[IM] prefers _fatigatio_:\r\nbut as the difference is of small importance, I have not departed from\r\nAlmeloveen.\r\n\r\n  [IM] Ep. 6. p. 133.\r\n\r\n23. _Warm water._) It appears a little doubtful, why our author\r\nshould mention this, as he adds _the bath_ immediately after: unless\r\nby _balneum_ he means all the processes at the bath; and by the other,\r\nbathing in warm water alone.\r\n\r\n24. _Mulse_ was made of two parts of wine, and one of honey. Dios.\r\nlib. v. cap. 790. But from Celsus, it would appear that the\r\nproportions were arbitrary: for he says, Mulse is more nourishing the\r\nmore honey it contains. Lib. ii. cap. 18.\r\n\r\n25. _Hyssop._) Hippocrates thus prescribes it for a vomit to\r\ncorpulent men; let about a gill of powdered hyssop be given to drink\r\nin a gallon of water, adding a little vinegar and salt, to make it as\r\npleasant as possible; and let this be drunk at first gradually, and\r\nafterwards more quickly. Lib. de Salub. Vict. Rat. p. 338. Edit. Gen.\r\n1657.\r\n\r\n26. _Lotus._) There are several species of this mentioned by ancient\r\nauthors; but the particular kind intended here seems to be the lotus\r\nÆgyptius, growing in the water, with a stalk resembling the _cyamus_.\r\nIt has a root like a quince, and is eaten both raw and boiled, and in\r\nthe last way, in quality, it is like the white of an egg. The Egyptians\r\nmake bread of its head, which resembles poppy.--See Dioscorid. lib. iv.\r\ncap. 696. and Plin. Hist. Nat. lib. xiii. cap. 17 and 18.\r\n\r\n27. _The body is rendered humid._) Lommius asserts the copies to be\r\nevery one corrupted in this place. From the moisteners he strikes out\r\nthe following,--_continuing awake_, _long and brisk walking_, _morning\r\nexercise without eating after it_,--as unworthy of our author. And\r\nfor the same reason, in the list of dryers, inserts _watching and\r\nunction, without bathing in cold water_. This I thought proper to\r\nmention in a note, but did not chuse to take so great liberties with\r\nthe text against the authority of all the other copies, but leave it\r\nto the judgment of the learned reader, though I rather incline to the\r\nalteration proposed. Vide Lomm. Comment. de Sanitat. tuend. p. 218 and\r\n219.\r\n\r\n28. _Apples_, _Poma_.) Under this Celsus includes all the apple-kind;\r\nand he elsewhere comprehends in this genus, cherries, mulberries, &c.\r\nso that he seems to take in all the pulpy fruits, whether they have\r\nstones or not. Wherever he intends what we particularly call apples, he\r\nmakes a distinction, as _Quæque propriè poma nominantur_, lib. ii. cap.\r\n18.\r\n\r\n29. _Salt wine._) “Wines are prepared with sea water in different\r\nways; for some, immediately after gleaning the grapes, mix sea-water\r\nwith them; others expose them to the sun, and thus tread them, adding\r\nsea-water. Others again, make the grapes into raisins, and macerate\r\nthem in vessels with sea-water, and thus tread and press them. Wine\r\nmade in this way is sweet: but there are others prepared of a more\r\naustere taste[IN].”\r\n\r\n  [IN] Dioscorid. lib. v. c. 801.\r\n\r\nPliny tells us, That the properties of this wine were first\r\naccidentally discovered by a servant stealing some wine, and filling up\r\nthe vessel with sea-water[IO].\r\n\r\n  [IO] Nat. Hist. lib. xiv. c. 8.\r\n\r\n30. _Defrutum_ is sweet must, boiled to one half its quantity, done\r\nto imitate honey. Plin. lib. xiv. cap. 9. Columella says to one-third,\r\nwhich Pliny calls sapa. Ibid.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTES\r\n\r\nTO\r\n\r\nBOOK II.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. _Not but in any weather._) Morgagni observes, that in the\r\noriginal, it should be read, _Non quod non omni tempore, omni\r\ntempestatum genere_; so that the translation should run, _Not but in\r\nany season, and in any weather_. What renders this correction more\r\nprobable is, that a few lines before, Celsus had said, _Quæ tempora\r\nanni, quæ tempestatum genera_.--These two words, though omitted\r\nby Juntas and Cæsar, and after them by Linden and Almeloveen, are\r\nnevertheless extant in the MS. and the other editions he perused. Ep.\r\n6. p. 142.\r\n\r\n2. _To be most apprehended in the spring._) The words in the original\r\nare, _Vere tamen maxime_, &c.--As there is no opposition\r\nbetween this observation and any going before, if the reading be right,\r\nthere must be a chasm in the text.--But I suspect _tamen_ ought to be\r\n_quam_, and have rendered it accordingly.\r\n\r\n3. _Dropsical disorders._ _Aqua inter cutem._) This is a term used\r\nby our author, to signify a slight species of the _leucophlegmatia_,\r\nor the first appearances of a dropsy. See the beginning of the 21st\r\nchapter of lib. iii.\r\n\r\n4. _Braces a sound body._ _Spissat sanum corpus._) Literally, it\r\nthickens, or compacts a sound body.--The interpretation here given is\r\nconfirmed by opposite effects of the south wind, a few lines after,\r\n_Corpus efficit hebes_, _humidum_, _languidum_.\r\n\r\n5. _If the temples be strait bound._) This happens, when there is no\r\nperspiration from them.\r\n\r\n6. _And pubes be full._) Linden and Almeloveen here have _plana_--But\r\nI chose rather with Constantine to read _plena_; both because the\r\nappearance is then exactly opposed to what follows in the IV. chapter,\r\nas a bad symptom in those parts, and because it corresponds better with\r\nHippocrat. aphor. 35. sect. 2.\r\n\r\n7. _At the end of a distemper._) Celsus takes this from Coac. Prænot.\r\n601. which if he had translated literally, he would have said, instead\r\nof _Sub fine morbi, ad crisim_; which shows his great care to avoid the\r\nGreek terms of art, and render the knowledge of medicine as easy as\r\npossible to his countrymen.\r\n\r\n8. _Betwixt the fourth hour._) The Romans divided the day from\r\nsun-rise to sun-set into twelve equal parts, or hours; the measure of\r\nwhich therefore differed in proportion to the length of the day. The\r\nsixth hour was our twelve; it is easy to reckon all the rest by their\r\ndistance from that middle point. When they mention hours as a general\r\nmeasure of time, they mean equinoctial hours, as Plin. lib. xviii. cap.\r\n25.\r\n\r\n9. _Strigments_, _Strigmenta_.) I find the moderns differ about\r\nthe signification of this word; some taking it for the sordes\r\nabsterged from the skin at the baths or palestræ, other for abraded\r\nfibres from the guts. It is agreed on all hands, that Celsus by this\r\nword translates ξύσματα in Hippocrates, and so it is rendered by\r\nFoesius.--Though ξύσμα will bear either of these interpretations, yet\r\nit seems to favour the first, that not only Erotianus explains it\r\nso in his lexicon to Hippocrates; but Celsus himself, in the sixth\r\nbook, c. 6. orders a composition to be brought to the consistence of\r\n_strigmentum_.\r\n\r\n10. _Many ways._) Instead of _pluribus modis_, most editions have\r\n_pluribus morbis_. However, either of them will agree with what goes\r\nbefore and follows.\r\n\r\n11. _And if there is not a discharge of blood from the nose, &c._)\r\nIn Almeloveen and Linden the reading is thus, _Ac si inter ipsa initia\r\nsanguis è naribus non fluit, circa aures erumpit_.--Morgagni[IP] here\r\nobserves, that this does not agree with the prænotion, no. 6. whence\r\nthis whole context is taken; and also that these words, _Sanguis è\r\nnaribus_, are not in the margin, nor in any of his editions; and that\r\nConstantine and Ronsseus have in the margin _Initia aut viscera_, while\r\nall of them write in the text _Ipsa ulcera_, some _Non fluit_, others\r\n_Non fuit_; which the most ancient editions and the MS. have, and\r\nbesides _viscera_.--So that, upon the whole, he would incline to read\r\n_Ac si inter ipsa viscera non fit, circa aures erumpit_, viz. And if it\r\nis not formed amongst the viscera, it breaks out about the ears.\r\n\r\n  [IP] Ep. 7. p. 172.\r\n\r\n12. _If it grow less._) I have chosen to follow the older reading,\r\nwhich omits the negative particle, because it seems plain, that our\r\nauthor is here speaking not of the body, but the belly, in this and\r\nthe two preceding articles; the sense determines itself.--If the\r\nbelly yields to purging medicines or spontaneously discharges soft\r\nand figured excrements, and the effect of one or both appears in the\r\ndiminution of its bulk.\r\n\r\n13. _Is hysteric._) The original is, _Quæ locis laborat_; which\r\nby itself is pretty obscure, but the sense here given appears just,\r\nfrom comparing it with aphorism 35. sect. 5: Γυναικὶ ὑπὸ ὑστερικω̃ν\r\nἐνοχλουμένη, ἢ δυστοκούση, πταρμὸς ἐπιγινόμενος ἀγαθόν.--_Mulieri uteri\r\nstrangulatu vexatæ, aut difficultate partus laboranti, sternutatio\r\nsuccedens bono est._\r\n\r\n14. _Of that kind that breaks outward._) The text in this place\r\nin Almeloveen and Linden appears to be corrupt, who read, _At ex\r\nsuppurationibus hæ pessimæ sunt, quæ intus tendunt, sic ut exteriorem\r\nquoque cutem decolorent: ex his deinde, quæ in exteriorem partem\r\nprorumpit; tum quæ maximæ, quæque planissimæ sunt_. I own I could make\r\nno sense of it, that I thought tolerable. The plural number is used\r\nboth in the first and last members of the period; and the nature of\r\nthe distributor seems to require the same number to be used here. For\r\nthis reason I have made but two members, and read the latter thus: _Ex\r\nhis deinde quæ in exteriorem partem prorumpunt, quæ maximæ, quæque\r\nplanissimæ sunt._ By which small alteration we have an observation\r\nworthy of our author, and consonant to the parallel place in Hippocrat.\r\nCoac. Prænot. no. 281. where Foesius quotes this passage as here\r\nproposed.\r\n\r\n15. _In the middle of the body._) An ascites.\r\n\r\n16. _Puffed up as it were by fermentation, &c._) Foesius observes\r\nin a note upon lib. ii. prædictor. 31. from whence this context is\r\nclosely copied, that ἀπόζυμος γαστὴρ, _fermentatus venter_, is an\r\nunusual kind of expression, which makes him suspect the reading should\r\nbe ὑποξήρους, which he thinks is supported by Galen in his Exegesis,\r\nwho says that ὑποξήρους περὶ γαστέρων signifies ταπεινοτέρας _aut_\r\nπροεσταλμένας, that is _dried up_, _extenuated_, _contracted_. Foesius\r\nthinks too, that Celsus by mistake has read λιπαράς for ῥυπαρὰς, _fat_\r\nfor _sordid_. But as this is only conjecture, it is much more natural\r\nto suppose, that λιπαρὰς was the true reading, and that ῥυπαρὰς had\r\ncrept in since the time of Celsus.\r\n\r\n17. _Therefore an intermission_, &c.) In Almeloveen the reading is\r\nthus, _Expectanda ergo intermissio est: si non decedit, cum crescere\r\ndesiit: si neque remissio speratur, tunc quoque_, &c.--[IQ] Morgagni\r\nobserved this reading to be suspicious, as it was not probable our\r\nauthor would have mentioned its stop before its remission; and upon\r\nexamining his editions, he found this reading in them all, _Expectanda\r\nergo remissio est_. _Si non decrescit; sed crescere desiit, tunc\r\nquoque_, &c. i. e. therefore a remission is to be waited for. If it\r\ndoes not remit, but has ceased to increase, in that case the only, &c.\r\n\r\n  [IQ] Ep. 5. p. 139.\r\n\r\n18. _Already hurt._) I have here rejected the word _quam_ upon the\r\nauthority of the marginal reading; because it appears to me to spoil\r\nthe sense, which without it is very proper.\r\n\r\n19. _Penecillum._) [IR] Fabricius ab Aquapendente makes _penecillum_\r\na tent made of scraped lint. I think he is right as to its form\r\nand materials; but it often occurs in Celsus, where it is used as\r\na pledgit, and not introduced into any cavity, as in this place.\r\nNotwithstanding, in other places, it exactly corresponds to a tent,\r\nas lib. vii. cap. 4. when used to a fistula.--For this reason I have\r\nchosen to retain the original word.\r\n\r\n  [IR] Lib. II. de Vulnerib. cap. 8.\r\n\r\n20. _Scales of copper._) These are scales that fly off in hammering\r\nred-hot copper. They were washed and rubbed in a mortar, to free them\r\nfrom any adhering sordes, and when cleaned and dried, put by for use.\r\nDioscorid. lib. v. cap. 863.\r\n\r\nCelsus added here, called by the Greeks λεπὶς χαλκου̃, which he had\r\nliterally translated by _squama æris_.\r\n\r\n21. _Sea spurge_, _Lactuca marina_.) Our author elsewhere says, that\r\nthis herb by the Greeks is called tithymalus--of which Dioscorides\r\nenumerates seven species, all similar in their virtues, amongst which\r\nis the παράλιος or maritime kind here mentioned. Dioscorid. lib. iv.\r\ncap. 747.\r\n\r\n22. _Hydromel_ was made of two parts of water to one of honey.\r\nDioscorid. lib. v. cap. 791.\r\n\r\n23. _Ptisan_ was made by steeping barley in water, till it swelled;\r\nthen drying it in the sun; afterwards beating it, till the husk came\r\noff; then grinding it; the meal was boiled in water, dried in the sun,\r\nand then set by. When used, it was boiled up again with water; and this\r\nwas what they called the _cremor_ or _succus ptisanæ_.\r\n\r\n24. _A decoction of vervains._) What herbs our author means by\r\n_vervains_, he shows in chapter 33d of this book.\r\n\r\n25. _Concerning friction_, &c.) In the text, _De frictione et\r\ngestatione adeo multa Asclepiades_, &c. which, though it be the reading\r\nin most copies, must necessarily appear erroneous by considering what\r\nfollows; and therefore I have taken no notice of these words _et\r\ngestatione_.\r\n\r\n26. _Digestion._) See note at lib. i. p. 6.\r\n\r\n27. _A prop is to be put under one foot_, &c.) In Linden and\r\nAlmeloveen the reading is, _At certe uni pedi lecti fulcimentum\r\nsubjiciendum est_.--But all the editions in the possession of\r\nMorgagni[IS] and the MS. have _Funiculus subjiciendus est_. A cord is\r\nto be put under one foot, &c. And in this way Mercurialis reads it,\r\nwhen he quotes this passage de Art. Gymnast. lib. iii. cap. 12.\r\n\r\n  [IS] Ep. 5. p. 132.\r\n\r\n28. _Clibanum_ was the name of a particular kind of oven among the\r\nRomans. As it is here mentioned, beside the laconicum or hot-room at\r\nthe bath, he probably intends by it a stove placed in a common room so\r\nas to heat it.\r\n\r\n29. _Fever._) Our author here means, either an acute continued fever,\r\nor the paroxysm of an intermitting one; as will appear by the following\r\nparagraph.\r\n\r\n30. _Bottles filled with hot oil_, _Utriculi_.) Their bottles were\r\nmade of leather. The nearest to this kind of practice among the moderns\r\nare the tin cases made in different shapes, and adapted to the abdomen,\r\nbreast, or joints, filled with hot water.\r\n\r\n31. Lentils.\r\n\r\n32. _The Cetus._) Cetus is generally translated _whale_ in English;\r\nbut it cannot be understood of what we call a whale, but is a general\r\nname for all the larger fishes that are viviparous.\r\n\r\n33. _Particular kind of bread_, _Opus pistorium_.) The English reader\r\nwill perceive, by the ingredients mentioned, that there is no such\r\nbread in modern use, and consequently no proper name for it. Pliny\r\nmentions the same composition. lib. xviii. cap. 11.\r\n\r\n34. _Phœnicopter._) This signifies a bird with purple wings; its\r\ntongue was of a delicious taste. Plin. lib. x. cap. 48.\r\n\r\n35. _Snails._) Cochlea, without distinction, is used to signify a\r\nsnail and periwinkle, which last is only the marine snail. The Romans\r\nwere at prodigious expence and trouble, to feed their snails to an\r\nalmost incredible size.\r\n\r\n36. _Conchylia_, according to Pliny, in different places, a delicate\r\nshell-fish, the greatest plenty of which came from the river Indus, of\r\nthe same nature and properties with the purple fish.\r\n\r\n37. _Siligo_ was a kind of wheat, very delicious to the taste,\r\nextremely white, growing best in moist ground. Plin. lib. xviii. cap.\r\n8.--The same author says it never grows so ripe as the other kinds; for\r\nwhen it is suffered to stand too long, it drops its grains, Id. ibid.\r\ncap. 10. Columella says that all wheat in a watery soil, after the\r\nthird sowing, turns into siligo. Lib. ii. cap. 9.\r\n\r\n38. _Than the mealy_, _Fragilia_.) Which translation appears to be\r\njust, from its opposition to _succosa_.\r\n\r\n39. _Thrush_, _Turdus_.) The Romans included several birds under this\r\nname.\r\n\r\n40. _Salsamenta_, which are salted and dried. Vide note at chap. 2.\r\nbook i.\r\n\r\n41. _Lacertus et aurata._) I have chosen rather to retain the Latin\r\nappellations of these fish, and several more, than to follow the\r\nconjectures of the moderns, where they are not agreed. _Aurata_ is\r\ntaken for the _gilt-head_, _corvus_, _a cabot_, _oculata_, _eye-fish_,\r\nresembling a lizard, _plani_, _flat_ _fish_, or _the turbot kind,\r\nlupus_ some will have _the pike_, others _sturgeon_. _Mullus_,\r\n_barbett_, or _mullet_.--See Pliny who describes them.\r\n\r\n42. _Four footed animal._) I have here rejected the particle _vel_,\r\naccording to the older reading; because our author would never say, _A\r\nquadruped or any animal that is sucking_, &c. since no other sucking\r\nanimals are used for food but quadrupeds.\r\n\r\n43. _Soft or sorbile._) The first by Dioscorides is called ἀπαλὸν,\r\nand the second ῥοφητὸν. Humelbergius in his notes upon Apicius de re\r\nCoquinar. takes the first to be eggs boiled soft without their shell,\r\nby us called poached eggs.\r\n\r\n44. _Alica_ is reckoned among the vernal seeds. It is a species of\r\nwheat which degenerates after being sown in soils not proper for it,\r\nas in Africa, where it has the name of zea. It is ground to meal, and\r\nthe husks taken from it, and then chalk is added to it, which renders\r\nit exceedingly white and soft. The best chalk for this purpose is found\r\nbetween Puteoli and Naples. A common way of counterfeiting it is to\r\ntake the largest and whitest grains of wheat, and after parboiling\r\nthese, and drying them in the sun, to sprinkle them, and after drying\r\na second time, to grind them. Plin. lib. xviii. cap. 7. and 11. The\r\nsame author says, this is an invention of the Romans, and not very old,\r\nunknown to the Greeks, otherwise they would not have bestowed so many\r\nencomiums upon their ptisan; because it was not mentioned by any of the\r\nfollowers of Asclepiades, he believed it was not used in the time of\r\nPompey the Great. Id. lib. xxii. cap. 25.\r\n\r\n45. _Pulse._) Pulticula is a diminutive of puls, which was a very\r\nancient kind of food, made of meal, water, honey, or with cheese and\r\neggs boiled, which, according to Pliny, the Romans used for many years,\r\nbefore they knew bread.\r\n\r\n46. _Passum._) Columella’s method of making passum (from Mago) is\r\nthis--Gather the early grapes thoroughly ripe, and throw away what\r\nstones are either dry or rotten. Expose them to the sun in the daytime,\r\nand cover them at night from the dew. When they are dried, take out the\r\nstones--then put them into a cask, and add as much of the best must\r\nas to cover them; when the grapes are macerated and filled, on the\r\nsixth day take them out and press them, and thus draw off the passum.\r\nColumell. lib. xii. cap. 39. This resembles nothing in modern use so\r\nmuch as raisin wine. Other inferior kinds were also prepared, for which\r\nsee Columella in the same chapter, and Pliny, lib. xiv. cap. 9.\r\n\r\n47. _Starch_, _amylum_, so called from its being prepared without a\r\nmill. Though the process among the ancients differed a little from the\r\npresent, yet the effect of the operation is the same.--See Dioscorid.\r\nlib. ii. cap. 311.\r\n\r\n48. _Tragum_ was made from wheat in the same manner as ptisan from\r\nbarley. Plin. lib. xviii. cap. 7.\r\n\r\n49. _Wombs of hogs._) This amongst the ancients was accounted a\r\ndelicate dish; it is now entirely disused. The butchers give that part\r\nthe name of the bearing bag.\r\n\r\n50. _Garum_ was a liquor made of the intestines of fish macerated\r\nwith salt. So that it was a kind of sanies of them in their putrescent\r\nstate. It was formerly made of the fish, which the Greeks called garos;\r\nafterwards it was prepared from a great many more, so that the kinds of\r\nit are almost infinite. It bore a higher price than any thing, except\r\nunguents. One kind was of the colour of old mulse, and so sweet and\r\nthin, that it might be drunk. Plin. lib. xxxi, cap. 7 and 8.\r\n\r\n51. _Bulbusses._) The ancients had several kinds of bulbusses.\r\n[IT]Dioscorides mentions the _bulbus esculentus_, which he says is\r\nknown to every body; it is good for the stomach and belly, of a reddish\r\ncolour, and brought from Africa. But the bitter and squillaceous kind\r\nis fitter for the stomach, and helps concoction. All of them are acrid\r\nand heating. Pliny, lib. xix. cap. 5. reckons up many species. Most\r\nnaturalists agree that they are not known now.\r\n\r\n  [IT] Lib. ii. cap. 389.\r\n\r\n52. _Pancake_, _Laganum_.) This differed a little from our pancake,\r\nas they added to it cheese, pepper, saffron, cinnamon, &c.\r\n\r\n53. _Those called crustumina_, &c.) Pliny observes that such fruits\r\nas these have taken their names, either from their planters, countries,\r\nor the persons whose taste they pleased. All these pears and apples are\r\nreckoned among the best kinds by him, lib. xv. cap. 14. and 15. as also\r\nby Columella, lib. v. cap. 10.\r\n\r\n54. _Wormwood._) In Linden and Almeloveen the word _absinthium_ is\r\nfollowed by _murices_, _purpuræ_, _cochleæ_, which are omitted in all\r\n[IU]Morgagni’s editions, except Ruellius and the MS. And as they appear\r\nredundant here, the same words occurring a few lines after, I have\r\ntaken no notice of them.\r\n\r\n  [IU] Ep. 6. p. 145.\r\n\r\n55. _Resinated._) This is made in different countries. It was very\r\ncommon in Gaul, where the grapes not thoroughly ripening by reason of\r\nthe cold, the wines turned sharp, unless mixed with resin. The resin,\r\ntogether with the bark of the tree, was either cut small, or powdered,\r\nand mixed with the wine. Some separated the resin from it by straining,\r\nothers let it stand. Such wines become sweet by age. Vide Plin. Nat.\r\nHist. lib. xiv. cap. 20. Columella, lib. xii. cap. 23. et Dioscorid.\r\nlib. v. cap. 817.\r\n\r\n56. _Pecten_ was a name for shell fish striated like cockles.\r\n\r\n57. _Murex and purpura._) These fishes afforded the purple dye, and\r\ntheir difference was not considerable according to ancient authors, but\r\nthey are not known now.\r\n\r\n58. _Sweet bread mentioned before_, viz. chap. 18.\r\n\r\n59. _Scarus_, taken for the _scar_ or _char_, _lolligo calamary_, or\r\n_sleeve-fish_, _locustus lobster_, _polypus pourcountrel_.\r\n\r\n60. _Pelorides._) This was a sort of shell fish, so called from\r\nPelorus, a promontory in Sicily, supposed by some to be cockles.\r\n\r\n61. _Soft water_, &c.) The reading in Linden is _Aqua, omnia tenera,\r\ntepida_, &c. but it is not probable our author would have expressed\r\nhimself so loosely as to say _aqua_, without any epithet. By making a\r\nsmall change in the order of the words, we find this properly opposed\r\nto _aqua dura_, said in chap. XXX. to bind the belly; I have therefore\r\nread with Constantine, Cæsar, Stephens, and several others, _Aqua\r\ntenera, omnia tepida, dulcia_.\r\n\r\n62. _Torminalia._) These, says Pliny, are the fourth species of the\r\nservice fruit, and probably called so from being used as a remedy; that\r\nis, for the dysentery, as appears by the name. Lib. xv. c. 21.\r\n\r\n63. _Sordid wool_, _Lana succida_, by Dioscorides called εἰρίον\r\nοἰσυπηρὸν. The more oily sordes it contained, it was reckoned so\r\nmuch the better and more emollient, upon account of its œsypum, the\r\npreparation of which will be mentioned in its proper place. The wool\r\nabout the neck and inside of the thighs was most esteemed. Dioscorid.\r\nlib. ii. cap. 720.\r\n\r\n64. _Cimolian chalk._) This had its name from Cimolus an island\r\nin the Cretan sea. There are two kinds of it, one white, and the\r\nother inclining to purple. The first by Dale, is thought to resemble\r\ntobacco-pipe-clay; and the second fullers earth. Vide Plin. lib. xxxv.\r\ncap. 17. et Dioscorid. lib. v. cap. 950.\r\n\r\n65. _Tarras_, _gypsum_, is a-kin to lime; for it is procured by\r\nburning a stone, which ought to resemble the alabaster, or marble. The\r\nbest kind is made from lapis specularis. Plin. lib. xxxvi. cap. 24.\r\nAmongst the moderns some take this to be the calx of alabaster, others\r\nof Muscovy glass, others of the selenites.\r\n\r\n66. _Oil of quinces._) _Oleum vel unguentum melinum_, according to\r\nDioscorides, was prepared by infusing and boiling some aromatics in\r\noil, and afterwards macerating quinces in it, and thus letting them\r\nstand till the oil had imbibed the strength of the quinces. Others made\r\nit with quinces alone. Dioscorid. lib. i. cap. 56.\r\n\r\n67. _Or myrtles._) This is prepared by bruising and pressing the\r\ntender leaves of the black myrtle, and mixing their juice with an equal\r\nquantity of the oil of unripe olives, then boiling them together, and\r\ntaking off whatever swims upon the top. Some thicken the oil first with\r\npomegranate bark, cypress, &c. Dioscorid. lib. i. cap. 49.\r\n\r\n68. _Of roses._) This is made by boiling the juncus odoratus with\r\nwater and oil, and after straining, fresh roses are infused in the\r\noil: they are stirred frequently with the hands rubbed with honey, and\r\nsqueezed. When they have stood for a night, they are pressed out. A\r\nsecond and third kind of rose oil is prepared, by infusing the same\r\nroses in fresh quantities of oil. Dioscorid. lib. i. cap. 54.\r\n\r\n69. _Bitter oil._) This has probably been prepared from the wild\r\nolive; for Pliny says, such is thin, and much more bitter than what is\r\nmade from the olive. Lib. xv. cap. 7.\r\n\r\n70. _Made of far._) Far is a species of wheat.--Columella reckons\r\nfour kinds of it. Pliny says it is the hardest of all, and firmest\r\nagainst winter. It was called also _semen adoreum_. It was the first\r\ngrain the Romans used. Pliny, lib. xvii. cap. 8, et Columella, lib. ii.\r\ncap. 6.\r\n\r\n71. _Cyprine oil_ was made from the tree called _cyprus_ in Egypt,\r\naccording to Pliny--And in his time some conjectured it to be the same\r\nwith the _ligustrum_ of Italy. Plin. Nat. Hist. lib. xii. c. 24.\r\n\r\n72. _Oil of iris._) The oil is first inspissated by boiling it with\r\nwater, and the involucrum of the fruit of the palm tree (called by\r\nDioscorides, spatha). When this is done, an equal quantity of bruised\r\niris is infused with this inspissated and aromatized oil, which stands\r\nfor two days and two nights, and then is strongly expressed. A more\r\nfragrant kind is prepared by inspissating the oil with balsam-wood and\r\ncalamus. After expression, a fresh quantity of iris may be added, if it\r\nbe desired stronger. Dioscorid. lib. i. cap. 67.\r\n\r\n73. _Nitre._) So much has been said by modern authors concerning\r\nthe nitre of the ancients, that it would be impertinent to give a\r\nparticular account of it here. The greatest plenty was produced in\r\nEgypt, in the lands which the Nile had overflowed. Most naturalists\r\nbelieve it to have been a native alkaline salt. Pliny says, it was\r\nadulterated in Egypt by lime, but that trick was easily discovered by\r\nputting it in water, when the true nitre would dissolve, and the lime\r\nnot. Plin. lib. xxxi. cap. 10. where a long account of it may be seen.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTES\r\n\r\nTO\r\n\r\nBOOK III.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. _Those things_, &c.) See book ii. chap. 2.\r\n\r\n2. _Digested._) See note lib. i. p. 6.\r\n\r\n3. _From the inguen._) Almeloveen would rather read _ingluvie_, or\r\n_sanguine_, than _inguine_. But these cannot be reckoned among the\r\nexternal causes. There is no reason to question the authority of the\r\ntext, if we remember what Hippocrates has said, aph. 55. sect. 4. ‘All\r\nfevers proceeding from buboes are bad, except a diary.’\r\n\r\n4. _For these reasons others defer it._) The translation is agreeable\r\nto the reading of Linden and Almeloveen. But Morgagni[IV] informs\r\nus, that all the editions in his possession, and the MS. too, read\r\nthus: _Ob hæc ad mediam noctem decurro, id est, finito jam gravissimo\r\ntempore, eodemque longissime distante, secuturis vero antelucanis\r\nhoris, quibus onmes fere maxime dormiunt, deinde matutino tempore, quod\r\nsua natura levissima est._ That is, ‘for these reasons I defer it till\r\nmidnight, that is, when the most severe time is over, and the return\r\nof it is at the greatest distance, this being succeeded by the hours\r\nbefore day-light, when every body generally sleeps most quietly, and\r\nthese followed by the morning, which is naturally the easiest period\r\nof all.’--He adds, beside the impropriety of the prescription, as it\r\nnow stands in Almeloveen, when Celsus meant quite otherwise; the place\r\nis the more worthy of notice, that it shews Celsus, although not for\r\ncommon, yet to have practised medicine.\r\n\r\n  [IV] Ep. 6. p. 157.\r\n\r\n5. _Apply his hand to his wrist, ejus_ carpo _manum admovere_.) The\r\nword _carpus_ appears suspicious, as it no where else occurs in Celsus.\r\nOn the contrary, in describing this part he says, _In manu vero, prima\r\npalmæ[IW] pars_, &c. and Morgagni[IX] observes the old reading was\r\n_corpori_, and _carpo_ only Constantine’s explication.\r\n\r\n  [IW] Lib. viii. cap. i.\r\n\r\n  [IX] Ep. 5. p. 115.\r\n\r\n6. _Intrita._) We have no particular description of this food in\r\nany of the ancients, as far as I remember. By comparing their several\r\napplications of this word, I take it to be a general term for several\r\nspecies of compositions, the ingredients of which were rubbed small in\r\na mortar, or softer materials macerated in liquids, as bread in wine,\r\nmentioned by Pliny, _Intrita panis e vino_, lib. ix. cap. 8.--By our\r\nauthor’s use of it here, it plainly appears to be something light,\r\nsoft, and simple, probably very like, if not the same with our panada.\r\n\r\n7. _But if one in such a fever coughs gently_, &c.) _Siquis autem in\r\nhujus modi febre leniter tussit, is neque vehmenti siti conflictari,\r\nneque bibere aquam frigidam debet; sed eo modo curandus\r\nest, quo in cæteris febribus præcipitur._--All this is omitted\r\nin Morgagni’s MS.--Ronsseus suspected it to be interpolated, and\r\nit is not to be found in the Pinzian edition, nor the Juntine, nor\r\nFlorentine.--Ronsseus’s suspicion arose from considering aph. 54. sect.\r\n4.--‘Those that are troubled with dry and gentle coughs in ardent\r\nfevers, are not very thirsty.’ Morgagni, Ep. 5. p. 140.--But perhaps\r\nthis objection might be removed by only reading _conflictatur_, instead\r\nof _conflictari_.\r\n\r\n8. _To twenty-four hours._) Linden and after him Almeloveen have\r\nfollowed Constantine in rejecting the preposition _inter_. But the old\r\nreading seems preferable, which was this,--_Inter horas viginti quatuor\r\net triginta sex_: that is, _The fit takes up between twenty-four hours\r\nand thirty-six_.\r\n\r\n9. _Cleanse his belly_, _vomendo ventrem purgaret_.) It is probable\r\nby _venter_ here our author means the stomach.\r\n\r\n10. _And apply that_, _et id ingerere._) I cannot help agreeing\r\nwith Scaliger, that these words are interpolated. For supposing them\r\nto mean the application of the medicine here mentioned, yet that is\r\nparticularly directed a few lines after. Besides I do not remember any\r\ninstance of _ingero_ bearing a sense that would answer in this place.\r\n\r\n11. _Greeks call zesis._ _Et jactationem, fervoremque corporis, quem\r\nζέσιν Græci vocant._)--All Morgagni’s[IY] editions and his MS. agree\r\nin reading thus, _Fætoremque quendam odoris, quem ὄζην Græci vocant_.\r\nWhich word from this single passage of Celsus has a place in Stephens’s\r\nThesaur. Ling. Græc. But as the sense, according to this last reading,\r\nis not near so proper, and as Linden, no doubt, had some authority for\r\nhis reading, I have abode by it.\r\n\r\n  [IY] Ep. 5. p. 139.\r\n\r\n12. _Former regimen strictly._) After the words, to which these\r\nanswer in the original, there follows in Linden and Almeloveen, _Et\r\naqua tantummodo calida, si sitis est, uti: ac tum ita nono die balneo\r\nfrigus prævenire, et_. Which must appear manifestly corrupt; for this\r\nwould be making the paroxysm of a quartan fever return after one day’s\r\ninterval: so that though the other words were retained, yet _nono_\r\nshould be undoubtedly changed into _decimo_. But I have chosen rather\r\nto follow the reading of Pinzi and Junta, which is perfectly consonant\r\nwith the context. _Septimo die balneo frigus prævenire, abstinere,\r\ncontinere se debet; si febris redierit, ducere alvum; ubi ex eo corpus\r\nconquieverit, inunctione vehementer perfricari, eodem modo sumere cibum\r\net vinum, biduo proximo se abstinere, frictione servata. Decimo die\r\nrursus balneum experiri, &c._ This makes the directions which follow\r\n_nono die_, to belong to the _seventh_; and _decimo die_ for _decimo\r\ntertio die_ still preserves the regular succession of the fits. This\r\nreading is confirmed by what our author adds in the next paragraph,\r\nwhere he prescribes a new method to be pursued, if the fever should\r\nreturn upon the thirteenth day. ‘Wherefore, if the distemper shall\r\ncontinue upon the thirteenth day, the bath must neither be tried before\r\nthe fever nor after it, &c.’ For if we allow the reading of Linden, &c.\r\n_decimo tertio die_, in the first paragraph, he orders bathing on this\r\nday; and in the next he absolutely forbids it.\r\n\r\n13. _Laser._) This was the juice or gum of a plant like the _ferula_,\r\nby the Latins called _laserpitium_, by the Greeks _silphium_. That\r\nkind, which was most esteemed, came from Cyrene, where it seems it was\r\nworn out in Pliny’s time, for he tells us only one stalk was found in\r\nhis memory, which was sent to Nero; he adds, that for a long time they\r\nhad no other imported to them, but what came from Persia, Media, and\r\nArmenia, where it grew in abundance, but much inferior to the Cyrenean,\r\nand adulterated with gum, sagapenum, or bean-meal.--See Plin. Nat.\r\nHist. lib. xix. cap. 3.--Some of the moderns take this for assa-fœtida;\r\nothers, among whom is Dr Lister, think it a different thing, and\r\nabsolutely unknown now. I have therefore chosen to retain the original\r\nword.--See the description of it Dioscorid. lib. iii. cap. 500.\r\n\r\n14. _Happened in the beginning._) _Cum id initio inciderit_; thus\r\nLinden and Almeloveen read it; some older editions have _vitio_, _when\r\nthat has happened by some mismanagement_; which agrees with what\r\nour author says in the end of the 15th chapter. Perhaps it might be\r\n_Initio, cum id inciderit_, that is, upon its first appearance, &c.\r\n\r\n15. _That cannot be assigned._ _Certis partibus assignari possunt._)\r\nConstantine, and after him Linden and Almeloveen, have thought fit to\r\nomit _non_, which will appear to any, who considers the sense to be\r\nmanifestly wrong. Our author himself determines it in the beginning of\r\nthe fourth book, where with reference to this part of his work he says,\r\n_Hactenus reperiuntur ea genera morborum, quæ in totis corporibus ita\r\nsunt, ut iis certæ sedes assignari non possint_. See Morgagni, Ep. 1.\r\np. 25.\r\n\r\n16. _There may be the same reason_, &c. _Nec minus dubitari potest,\r\nan alvus ducenda sit._) The connection of this sentence with the\r\ncontext has an obscurity very uncommon in our author. We must observe\r\nthat he is here maintaining the necessity of taking blood in phrenitic\r\ncases against Asclepiades: and after general reasons drawn from the\r\nnature of the disease, he adds an argument from the practice of that\r\nphysician. He prescribed clysters in this distemper, though, as Cælius\r\nAurelianus[IZ] observes, that was directly contrary to a principle of\r\nhis own. Celsus therefore insists, that there is no reason against\r\nbleeding, that is not equally strong against clysters, which are\r\nhowever approved by Asclepiades. According to the exact method every\r\nwhere observed by our author, this argument would naturally have\r\nfollowed what he said of friction ordered by Asclepiades: and as it now\r\nstands after the conclusion drawn, it seems to be an after-thought. If\r\nthis explication be thought unnatural, it may be otherwise paraphrased,\r\nand connected with the following paragraph thus: _The doubt is the same\r\nwith regard to clysters, as to the letting of blood, and the resolution\r\nis also the same. But after either of these, intermitting a day_, &c.\r\n\r\n  [IZ] De Acut. Morb. lib. i, cap. 15.\r\n\r\n17. _Ointment of saffron._) In preparing this they first inspissated\r\nthe oil by boiling it with calamus and myrrh, and then infusing saffron\r\nin it for five days, and stirring it frequently; and on the sixth the\r\noil was poured off clear. Others added the myrrh in powder, after the\r\noil was poured off the other ingredients.\r\n\r\n18. _Ajax or Orestes._) These cases are best illustrated by the\r\ntragedies of Sophocles and Euripides, which our author seems to have\r\nhad in view. Ajax enraged to see Ulysses preferred to him in the\r\ncompetition for the arms of Achilles, falls into madness. He resolved\r\nto revenge this affront upon the whole army. And in the night ran into\r\nthe fields, where their flocks and herds were grazing, murdered the\r\nshepherds and laid about him among the cattle, taking them for men;\r\nslew numbers of them, which he imagined to be Agamemnon, Menelaus,\r\nand others, that were accessary to his dishonour. Then bound and led\r\nprisoners to his tent many more oxen and sheep to be reserved for\r\ntortures, and flogged unmercifully a great ram for his adversary\r\nUlysses, before he put him to death. Orestes was affected in the same\r\nmanner. After the murder of his mother, he fancied himself haunted by\r\nthe furies, and her amongst them. He is represented as terrified by\r\ntheir frightful looks, sometimes reasoning, sometimes beseeching, and\r\nat other times drawing his sword to fight them. In one of these fits,\r\nlike Ajax, he falls upon the cattle. See Sophocl. Ajax flagell. et\r\nEuripid. Orest. et Iphigen. in Taur. Such are the figures presented to\r\nthe imagination in this species of madness.\r\n\r\n19. _Purged in the inferior parts._) The whole sentence, which runs\r\nthus, _Ubi ab inferiore parte purgandus aliquis est, ventrem ejus ante\r\nsolvendum esse: ubi à superiore, comprimendum esse_, is taken from\r\naph. 66. sect. 7. And after comparing them together, I conceive our\r\nauthor’s meaning to be, that when the intention is to purge, the belly\r\nshould first be moistened by diluent liquors taken inwardly, or perhaps\r\na laxative clyster administered to facilitate the operation. On the\r\ncontrary, when a vomit is intended, the belly should be bound.\r\n\r\n20. _Polenta_ is made from barley in several ways. The Greeks pour\r\nwarm water upon the grain, dry it for one night, and the day following,\r\ntoast it, and then grind it. Others toast it more, and sprinkle it\r\nagain with a little water, and dry it before they grind it. Others\r\nagain shaking out the recent barley from the green ears, bruise it,\r\nwhile moist, in a mortar, and wash it in baskets, dry it in the sun,\r\nbeat it again, and after it is cleansed, grind it. In whatever way it\r\nis prepared, they first of all toast three pounds of lintseed, and half\r\na pound of coriander, with an acetabulum of salt, and mix it in the\r\nmill, with twenty pounds of barley. Those that have a mind to preserve\r\nit for a longer time, put it into earthen vessels with its own flour\r\nand bran. In Italy it is ground fine after toasting, without pouring\r\nany water upon it, and mixed up with the ingredients abovenamed and\r\nmillet. Plin. b. xviii. cap. 7.\r\n\r\n21. _Vomit spontaneously._ _Sponte vomere._) That is, vomit without\r\nany emetic medicine being given.\r\n\r\n22. _Bulbous roots._) Aretæus mentions nothing of rubbing these\r\nover the whole body; but he recommends the small red kind, crude with\r\npepper, and the powdered lees of vinegar, as the best cataplasm for the\r\nfeet in this disorder. To which he adds this caution, that they must\r\nbe frequently removed, for fear of ulcerating the parts. Lib. ii. de\r\nCurat. Acut. Morb. cap. 3.\r\n\r\n23. _Inject by way of clyster._) Celsus here shews that he knew\r\nit was possible to nourish by clysters, and that it was sometimes\r\npractised--Cælius Aurelianus mentions the use of clysters in this\r\ndisorder, particularly acrid ones, as prescribed by the followers of\r\nSerapion, Heraclides, and Herophilus, and also by Asclepiades and\r\nThemison. But he does not give the least hint, as if any of these\r\nauthors directed an injection with a view to nourishment, but only\r\nto make a derivation of the humour from the skin to the belly. Cæl.\r\nAurelian. de Acut. Morb. lib. ii. cap. 38.\r\n\r\n24. _Malagmas._) These cannot according to the present division of\r\ncompositions admit of a literal translation, and therefore the original\r\nword is retained. By turning to the fifth book, chap. 17. and 18. will\r\nbe seen their difference from plaisters, &c. and that they consist of\r\nvarious ingredients, but compounded without any heat.\r\n\r\n25. _Catapotia._) Most of the moderns translate this word _pills_.\r\nBut our author does not limit their consistence nor form; for we find\r\nhim sometimes ordering them to be diluted, sometimes of the consistence\r\nof sordes, and sometimes swallowed about the bigness of a bean, and\r\nat other times dry powders given in some kind of liquor. See lib. v.\r\ncap. 25.--Scribonius Largus defines a catapotium as a medicine, that is\r\nswallowed without being diluted, cap. 22. comp. 87. Upon which Rhodius\r\nwill have them to be much the same with the bolusses now in use.\r\n\r\n26. _Attempt that by diet._) The reading in Almeloveen and Linden\r\nis _Alvum moliri cibo melius est_, &c. But as there was no mention of\r\nthe belly before, and no proper sense can be assigned to _molior_, as\r\nit there stands, I have followed the old reading, _Sed id ipsum moliri\r\ncibo melius est_, and the rather, as Celsus immediately subjoins proper\r\nmedicines for that purpose. This reading is approved by Morgagni, Ep.\r\n6. p. 149.\r\n\r\n27. _Nard._) It is generally agreed, that what we now have under the\r\nname of nard, is not the ancient kind. Dioscorides says, it resembles\r\nthe cyperus in its smell, has a small head, is bitter to the taste,\r\nand drying to the tongue, retaining its fragrancy for a long time.\r\nThere were two species of it, one called Indian, and the other Syrian.\r\nDioscorid. lib. i. cap. 6.\r\n\r\n28. _Balsam._) Our author does not distinguish what part of the\r\nbalsam-tree he intends. The ancients called the juice opobalsam, the\r\nwood xylobalsam, and the fruit carpobalsam; which distinction Celsus\r\nhimself elsewhere uses. Dioscorid. lib. i. cap. 18.\r\n\r\n29. _Panaces_, or _panax_.) Dioscorides mentions three kinds of\r\nthis, which are still retained by modern botanists. Considering the\r\nvirtues he ascribes to each, I think it probable our author intends the\r\n_panax Heracleum_, or Hercules’s all heal, from whence the opopanax is\r\nproduced. Though it is to be observed, that Pliny affirms the opopanax\r\nto be obtained from the panax Asdepium. Lib. xxv. cap. 4. P. Ægineta\r\nfrom the Heracleum lib. vii.\r\n\r\n30. _Cardamom._) It neither appears from Celsus nor Dioscorides,\r\nthat the seed was in use among the ancients. Some affirm it to be the\r\nsame with the modern greater cardamom. Dioscorides[JA] says, the best\r\ncomes from Comagene, Armenia and Bosphorus. It grows also in Arabia\r\nand India. The best is firm, large, compact, and pungent to the smell,\r\nacrid and bitterish to the taste; it has a heating quality. By this it\r\nwould seem they made use of the root.\r\n\r\n  [JA] Dioscorid. lib. i. cap. 5.\r\n\r\n31. _Acorum_ according to Dioscorides has leaves likes the iris, but\r\nnarrower, and roots not unlike to it, not growing straight, but oblique\r\nand creeping on the surface of the earth, whitish, divided by joints,\r\nacrid to the taste, and smelling not unpleasant. Lib. i. cap. 2.\r\n\r\n32. _The flower of long and round cyperus._) In the original _Juncus\r\nquadratus et juncus rotundus_. I shall not determine, whether what we\r\nnow call _cyperus longus, et rotundus_, are the same as here mentioned.\r\nHowever, they certainly belong to the same class, and the virtues\r\nascribed to the present, agree pretty nearly with those attributed to\r\nthe ancient by Dioscorid. lib. i. cap. 4. and 16.--See also Dale and\r\nSchroder.\r\n\r\n33. _Bound upon the skin._) This seems a very odd way of using\r\nsquils; the old reading appears much more just. _Utiliter etiam scilla\r\ncocta delinitur cutis._ _It does good also to rub boiled squils\r\nover the skin._ The same variety recurs at the end of the following\r\nparagraph, _Sicut supra dixi delinitur_, instead of _Simul super\r\nventrem deligatur_.\r\n\r\n34. _Frequent pimples._) That is the smoothness or continuity of the\r\nskin is interrupted by pimples and ulcers.\r\n\r\n35. _Takes its rise from the head._) From a catarrh, which the\r\nancients imagined to be a discharge from the brain through the os\r\nethmoides.\r\n\r\n36. _Mild as gruel._) I have here departed from Linden and\r\nAlmeloveen, who have it thus, _Deinde lenis sorbitio_, &c. _Afterwards\r\nmild gruel_, because the more ancient reading, _Dein lenis, ut\r\nsorbitio_, besides being more elegant, is confirmed by the following\r\nwords of our author.\r\n\r\n37. _And especially brains._) I have taken no notice of the words _ex\r\nprima_ in the reading of Linden and Almeloveen, which manifestly spoil\r\nthe sense, otherwise complete without them. [JB]Morgagni observes,\r\nthat all the other editions read, either _ex pruna_, or _ex aprugna_;\r\nbut this last is not probable, because he said, that a boar was of the\r\nstrongest class of food, lib. ii. but the whole head of a lamb or kid\r\nin the middle kind; and the former seems to be superfluous.\r\n\r\n  [JB] Ep. 7. p. 180.\r\n\r\n38. _Comitial_, so called from the comitia or assemblies of the\r\npeople being adjourned, when any person was taken with one of these\r\nfits.\r\n\r\n39. _Arquatus._) The obscurity of this name gives room to the\r\nconjectures of critics. Some tell us it was so called, because the\r\ncolour in the jaundice resembles the greenness of the rainbow; others\r\nbecause it bends the bodies of those afflicted with it like a bow.\r\n\r\n40. _Suppurations._) Ronsseus think this paragraph wrong placed here,\r\nas having no connection with what goes before; and suspects its proper\r\nplace to be at the end of the twenty second chapter of this same book;\r\nbecause the author there treats of consumptive people, and suppurations\r\nof the lungs. Morgagni also believes it to be improperly placed, Ep. 1.\r\np. 32.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTES\r\n\r\nTO\r\n\r\nBOOK IV.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. Sometimes _like a small tongue_, viz. the epiglottis.\r\n\r\n2. _Below the last ribs_, &c.) I have here translated, according to\r\nan emendation proposed by Morgagni[JC], who would read, _Qui lumbis sub\r\nimis costis inhærent, a parte earum rotundi, ab altera resimi_. Where\r\na small alteration renders the description just: whereas in the way\r\nit stands in all the editions, _Qui lumbis sub imis coxis inhærent, a\r\nparte earum resimi, ab altera rotundi_, it plainly contradicts truth,\r\nas will be very obvious to any person the least conversant in anatomy.\r\n\r\n  [JC] Ep. 1. p. 32.\r\n\r\n3. _They are stocked with vessels, and covered with coats._)\r\nIn Almeloveen, _Et venosi sunt, et tunicis super conteguntur_.\r\nMorgagni[JD] informs us, that after the three first words, all his\r\neditions agree in inserting _Et ventriculos habent_, _and they have\r\nventricles_; and it is not probable our author would take no notice of\r\nthese; and to the same purpose speaks Hippocrates de Ossium Natur. no.\r\n8.\r\n\r\n  [JD] Ep. 6. p. 144.\r\n\r\n4. _Relaxation of the nerves._) _Resolutio nervorum_ he commonly uses\r\nfor a palsy, yet he cannot intend that here, but a langour or slight\r\nrelaxation of the solids.\r\n\r\n5. _Cervicalia._) Cervicale was used in a double sense by the Romans,\r\neither for a bolster, or a piece of dress resembling the neckcloth.\r\n\r\n6. _And venery_, _A venere_.) It is probable that Almeloveen is wrong\r\nin omitting after this _a vino_, which is in Morgagni’s[JE] MS and all\r\nhis editions especially as a few lines after, our author mentions the\r\ncondition of allowing wine.\r\n\r\n  [JE] Ep. 6. p. 149.\r\n\r\n7. _Nostrils are more open._) In Almeloveen _magis pallent_. Though\r\nthe MS and Cæsar and Ruellius read thus, yet it is plain from the text\r\nitself that the other editions are right, which have it _magis patent_;\r\nfor our author presently adds, in a worse state of the disorder, the\r\ncontrary symptom: _Si nares æque clausæ videntur._ Morgagni, Ep, 6. p.\r\n140.\r\n\r\n8. _Aminean wine._) This, says Pliny, has the preference of all other\r\nwines, upon account of its strength, and its growing better by age.\r\nPlin. Nat. Hist. lib. xiv. cap. 2. And thus Virgil says, Georg. 2.\r\nline 97.--_Sunt et Amineæ vites, fortissima vina._\r\n\r\n9. _Liquid cerate_, says Ægineta, such as is used for fractures, is\r\nprepared from two parts of oil and one of wax. Lib. vii. cap. 17.\r\n\r\n10. _Syrian oil._) I suppose our author must here mean what was\r\ncalled from its sweetness _elæomeli_--which Pliny says is produced\r\nspontaneously in the maritime parts of Syria. It flows from the trees,\r\nfat, thicker than honey, thinner than resin, of a sweet flavour, and\r\nis used by the physicians. Plin. Nat. Hist. lib. xv. cap. 7.--And\r\nto the same purpose Dioscorid. lib i. cap. 37.--To this account P.\r\nÆgineta adds, that about two cyathi of this taken in a hemina of water\r\ndischarge crude and bilious humours by stool; but that this draught is\r\napt to stupefy a person, which, however, is not dangerous, but he would\r\nrequire to be excited. P. Æginet. lib. vii. cap. 3.\r\n\r\n11. _Synanche_, or _Cynanche_.) According to Aretæus, the latter of\r\nthese names was given to the distemper, either because it was common to\r\ndogs, or because these animals, even in health, hang out their tongues.\r\nLib. i. de Caus. et Sign. Morb. Acut. cap. 7.\r\n\r\n12. _His belly must be opened._ _Si non febrit, venter solvendus\r\nest._) This I take to be the general direction; if he has no fever,\r\nthe intestinal discharge must be promoted--_Liquenda alvus_, by which\r\nI understand the accomplishment of this by diet or medicines, and\r\n_Interdum etiam ducenda_, the use of clysters.\r\n\r\n13. _Lycium_ or puxacantha, _box-thorn_, a tree of the thorn-kind.\r\nThe branches, with the leaves, are bruised and macerated for some days\r\nin water, then boiled, and after straining it, is boiled again to the\r\nconsistence of honey. The best lycium is what will burn. It has an\r\nastringent quality. They adulterate it by mixing lees of oil, or the\r\ninspissated juice of wormwood or ox-gall in the boiling. Dioscorid.\r\nlib. i. cap. 133.\r\n\r\n14. _Frankincense, thus._) It is generally allowed, that what the\r\nancients called _thus_, goes now under the name of olibanum.\r\n\r\n15. _Stomach._) When our author mentions the gullet and stomach\r\ntogether, as in the first chapter of this book, he calls the former\r\n_stomachus_, and the latter _ventriculus_; but he often comprehends\r\nboth under the name of _stomachus_, as in this place, which appears by\r\nthe disorders mentioned.\r\n\r\n16. _A powder with oil._) This word is _pulvis_--Our author does not\r\nsay what powder. He had mentioned rose-oil just before: can he intend\r\nthe powder of rose-leaves? or any of those powders he prescribes in the\r\ncardiac disorder, the last of which is _quilibet ex via pulvis_, any\r\ncommon dust? Or has the word, denoting the kind, been omitted by the\r\ncopiers?\r\n\r\n17. _Sulphurated wool._) I suppose he means wool impregnated with the\r\nfumes of sulphur.\r\n\r\n18. _Cutiliæ, &c._) The waters of Cutiliæ in the country of the\r\nSabines, Pliny says, are extremely cold, and by a kind of suction\r\nexcite a sensation in the body like a bite; they are very useful to the\r\nstomach, nerves, and the whole body. Lib. xxxi. cap. 2. Our industrious\r\ncritics and collectors have not been able hitherto to find any such\r\nplace as _Subruinæ_ or _Sumbruinæ_, and therefore to cut the knot they\r\ncannot loose, propose to read here, as well as in the forecited place\r\nof Pliny, _Subcutiliæ_.\r\n\r\n19. _Rhetic or Allobrogic._) These wines, whose qualities are here\r\ndescribed, had their names from the countries where they were produced;\r\nthe first was the Grisons, and the latter Savoy.\r\n\r\n20. _Signine._) This wine by reason of its great austerity was used\r\nas an astringent medicine in fluxes. It had its name from the town of\r\nSignia in Latium. Plin. Nat. Hist. lib. xiv. cap. 6.\r\n\r\n21. _Sesanum._) Dioscorides gives no description of this, but says,\r\nit is bad for the stomach, and produces a bad smell in the mouth. Lib.\r\nii. cap. 369. Pliny tells us it is brought from India, and the colour\r\nof it is white, and it resembles the _erysimum_ or hedge mustard in\r\nGreece and Asia. Lib. xviii. cap. 10. The moderns give this name to the\r\noily purging grain.\r\n\r\n22. _Over it._) That is, through the teguments, so as to bring the\r\npart affected into view. I have here followed the old reading _contra\r\nid_, which Constantine upon the authority of an ancient MS. changed\r\ninto _ultra id_; which I think does not afford so good a sense, though\r\nfollowed by Linden.\r\n\r\n23. _Cytisus_ is a shrub, all white like the buckthorn, sending out\r\nbranches of a cubit’s length or more, about which are the leaves,\r\nresembling fenugreek; which being rubbed between the fingers smell like\r\nrocket. Dioscorid. lib. iv. cap. 695.\r\n\r\n24. _Acorns._) Dioscorides calls this βάλανος μυρεψική. It is the\r\nfruit of a tree like the myrica.--It resembles the Pontic nut: upon\r\nbeing squeezed like bitter almonds, it emits a moisture, which is used\r\nfor ointments instead of oil.--It grows in Ethiopia, Egypt, and Arabia.\r\nLib, iv. cap. 742.\r\n\r\n25. _Ferula_ answered to _narthex_ among the Greeks, and was a\r\ngeneral name for several herbs of the same genus, from whence some\r\nof the fetid gums are obtained, as sagapenum, and galbanum.--The\r\nancients made use of the stalks of these herbs, in the same manner as\r\npaste-boards are now used for fractures, as will be seen in the eighth\r\nbook.\r\n\r\n26. _Refreshing to nature._) I have given a sense of the phrase\r\n_secundum naturam_ (which is the reading of Linden and Almeloveen) very\r\nnear to that, in which the philosophers use it, because I can find\r\nno other.--Pinzius, Junta, and the Manutii read _vel mentha secundum\r\nnaturam est_. As the books vary, and none of them make the meaning\r\nquite clear, it might perhaps be plainer, if it be read, _vel quod\r\nsecundum eam naturam est_, that is, _Or mint, or something of the same\r\nnature_.\r\n\r\n27. _Regimen for such patients I have already mentioned._) Vid. book\r\ni. chap. 7.\r\n\r\n28. _Minium._) Pliny complains that _minium_, which was used by the\r\npainters, was of a poisonous nature, and through ignorance often given\r\nin medicine instead of the _Indian cinnabar_. This last, he says, is\r\nbelieved to be the gore of a dragon crushed by the weight of a dying\r\nelephant, with the mixture of the blood of these animals. _Minium_ was\r\nfound in the silver mines in both the Spains, but hard and sandy; also\r\nat Colchos in a certain inaccessible rock, but this was a spurious\r\nkind: the best was got near Ephesus.----_Minium_ some of the Greeks\r\ncall _cinnabar_, others _miltos_. Plin. lib. xxix. c. i. & lib. xxxiii.\r\nc. 7. _Cinnabar_, says Dioscorides, some mistake for what is called\r\n_ammion_: for this last is prepared from a certain stone mixed with the\r\nsilver sand in Spain, and no where else. In the melting pot it changes\r\ninto a very florid and flame colour: it has a suffocating steam in the\r\nmines: the painters make use of it. But _cinnabar_ is brought from\r\nLibya, and sold at a great price, in so much that painters can hardly\r\nhave it for their use: the colour of it is deep, whence some have\r\nimagined it to be the blood of a dragon: it has the same virtues as the\r\nhæmatites stone. Lib. v. c. 883.--_Miltos Sinopica_, the best is solid\r\nand heavy, of a liver colour, not stony, very thin when melted. It is\r\ngathered in Cappadocia in certain caves; it is strained and brought\r\nto Sinope, and sold there, whence its name. It possesses a drying\r\nquality, and agglutinating, for which reason it is mixed with vulnerary\r\nplaisters, and drying and styptick troches. It binds the belly if taken\r\nwith an egg, and is given in clysters to hepatick patients, Lib. v. c.\r\n885.----Our author elsewhere prescribes _minium_ from _Sinope_, which\r\nmakes it probable, that he intended the _miltos_ of Dioscorides. But\r\nupon comparing these several descriptions, which it is needless to\r\nenlarge upon, the learned reader may determine for himself.\r\n\r\n29. _Tetrapharmacum_, or compounded of four medicines. Vid. lib. v.\r\nc. 19.\r\n\r\n30. _Myrrhapia._) So called, according to Pliny, from the likeness of\r\ntheir flavour to that of myrrh. Lib. xxv. c. 15.\r\n\r\n31. _If the hardness continue._) _Si durities manet._ This appears\r\nsuspicious, as our author had mentioned no hardness before. In this\r\nchapter he first describes hysterick fits, then prescribes the proper\r\ntreatment both during the paroxysms, and after they are over. We have\r\nvery great reason to believe the whole chapter to be corrupted, for\r\nreasons which will be mentioned in a following note. With regard to\r\nthis particular place, my opinion is, that after Celsus had finished\r\nwhat he had to say concerning hysterick fits, he next proceeded to\r\ntreat of a hardness of the uterus; and after directing some remedies,\r\nin case of their failing, and the hardness continuing, he orders other\r\nmedicines to be tried.--What renders this conjecture the more probable,\r\nis, that Aretæus, amongst the chronick diseases of the uterus, mentions\r\nσκληριη, _a hardness_. “There is,” says he, “another species of\r\ncancer, where there is no ulcer, but a hard and resisting tumour. The\r\nwhole uterus is stretched, violent pains distress, and all the other\r\nsymptoms are the same as in a cancerous ulcer of this part.” Lib. ii.\r\nde caus. et sig. morb. chron. c. 2.\r\n\r\n32. _Restringents must be used._) _Si maligna purgatio est,\r\nsubjicienda sunt coërcentia_: thus Linden and Almeloveen.--Morgagni\r\nobserves, that the MS. copy of Alex. Paduan, after the words\r\n_subjicienda sunt_, not only has a great vacuity to the end of the\r\npage, but in the beginning of the next _coëuntia_, and in the margin\r\nopposite to this chasm are written these words, _Desunt in vetustissimo\r\nexemplari duo folia_. _Two leaves are wanting in the oldest copy._ In\r\nthis also, where the indexes were prefixed to each book, he found the\r\nfollowing in the fourth--Vulva exulcerata est--De vesica--De calculis\r\nin vesica--In omni dolore vesicæ. And in the margin of the book,\r\nhe found, _Vulva ulcerata est_, written opposite to _Si vero vulva\r\nexulcerata est_. Then should have followed the two other--And the last,\r\nnamely, _In omni dolore vesicæ_, was set over against _Præter hæc in\r\nomni dolore vesicæ_, and not _vulvae_, as Linden and Almeloveen read it.\r\n\r\nIn the MS. in the library of St Anthony at Venice, he found the\r\npreceding chasm much larger, 42 large pages, the same observation\r\nin the margin, and the correspondent numbers in the contents of the\r\nbook.--Morgagn. ep. ii. p. 45.--ep. iii. p. 50. So that it is probable\r\nour author had first finished the diseases of the uterus, as being\r\npeculiar to women, and then proceeded to those of the urinary bladder,\r\nas common to both sexes.\r\n\r\n33. _And especially rue with vinegar, &c._) Almeloveen and Linden\r\nread, _praecipueque ex aceto; vitare autem oportet rutam, et ne supinus\r\ndormiat_. This is making Celsus condemn what all physicians almost\r\nhave approved, and therefore with Constantine and Ronsseus, I read\r\n_praecipueque ex aceto rutam: vitare etiam oportet ne supinus dormiat_:\r\nwhich Morgagni prefers. Ep. i. p. 27.\r\n\r\n34. _At such seasons as it returns._) I have here followed the\r\ncorrection offered by Morgagni _his_ for _hi_ which last would\r\nmanifestly destroy our author’s meaning, as may appear from the general\r\nsense of the whole sentence--Instead of the present translation it\r\nwould be, _by those upon whom it returns_.\r\n\r\n35. _Sarcophagus_, or _flesh-eating_.) This is found at Assos, a city\r\nof Troas. Dead bodies interred in it are said to be consumed in forty\r\ndays, bones and every thing, except the teeth. Plin. l. xxxvi. c. 17.\r\n\r\n36. _Asian stone._) Dioscorides says this ought to be of the colour\r\nof the pumice, spongy, light, and easily friable. Lib. v. c. 916.\r\n\r\n37. _Acopon_, according to the derivation of the word, signifies\r\nsomething that relieves lassitude, which was rubbed upon the\r\njoints.--Our author exhibits some forms of them lib. v. cap. 24. where\r\ntheir consistence varies.--P. Ægineta for _acopa_ orders four parts of\r\noil to one of wax, lib. vii. cap. 17.--In later ages the word was used\r\nin a more extensive sense, for compositions of the consistence of oil,\r\nor as a liniment even when the intention was not to relieve fatigue.\r\n\r\n38. _Most agreeable to his humour._) That is, Celsus supposes a man\r\nin good health, who is his own master, to be confined to no laws, lib.\r\ni. cap. i. but upon account of a preceding illness he must return to\r\nthat gradually.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTES\r\n\r\nTO\r\n\r\nBOOK V.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. _Chalcitis._) Pliny lib. xxxiv. cap. 2. says, this was an ore of\r\ncopper, and found in Cyprus. Dioscorides describes the best chalcitis\r\nas resembling copper, easily friable, having shining veins. Lib. v.\r\ncap. 889.\r\n\r\n2. _Gum_, when mentioned alone in any of the ancient authors, is\r\nunderstood to be the same with what now bears the name of gum Arabic.\r\n\r\n3. _Calcined lead. Plumbum combustum._) The process of this is\r\nmentioned by Dioscorides under the correspondent Greek name--It was\r\nprepared by putting very thin laminæ of lead, with sulphur strewed\r\nupon each of them, into an earthen pot, and keeping them on the fire,\r\nstirred with an iron rod, till the lead was converted into ashes. It\r\nwas afterwards rubbed in a mortar, and washed by repeated affusions of\r\nwater, till no dross swam at top. Dioscorid. lib. cap. 870.\r\n\r\n4. _Misy._) This hath the same virtues as the chalcitis, and they\r\nonly differ in the degree of strength. The best comes from Cyprus, of a\r\ngold colour, hard, and when broken, shining and stellated. Dioscorid.\r\nlib. v. cap. 891.\r\n\r\n5. _Allum._) There are several kinds of this mentioned by the\r\nancients. Dioscorides says, the scissile, round and liquid, were\r\napplied to medicinal purposes, and that the scissile was the best. Lib.\r\nv. cap. 897.\r\n\r\n(6) _Melinum._) As our author in this place mentions only simples, he\r\ncannot intend by this word, oil of quinces; so that it must either be\r\na kind of colour that came from Melos, or else the Melian allum; in\r\nwhich last sense the comma ought to be expunged betwixt _alumen_, and\r\n_Melinum_.--But it is necessary to observe, that our author mentioning\r\nthis species of allum in the sixth book, calls it _Alumen Melium_,\r\nwhich in other editions is _Alumen Melinum_.\r\n\r\n7. _Iron scales_ are reckoned to have the same virtue as its rust,\r\nbut not so efficacious.\r\n\r\n8. _White vine._) Paul Ægineta mentions the _Ampelos leuce_, or\r\n_white vine_, which he said was also called _bryonia_. Lib. vii.\r\n\r\n9. _Propolis_ is a gluey matter, of a fetid smell, found in the\r\nhoney-combs, which Pliny says serves to keep out the cold.--Dale calls\r\nit bee-bread.--Others call it bee-glue.\r\n\r\n10. _Soot of frankincense._) Dioscorides orders it to be made\r\nthus,--“With a pair of small tongs light a bit of thus at a lamp,\r\nand put it into a new hollow earthen vessel, which is covered with a\r\nconcave copper one, with an opening in the middle, and carefully anoint\r\nit over; on one side or both, put small stones to the height of four\r\nfingers, to show if it burns, and that there may be room to put in\r\nother bits, before the first be entirely extinguished; and continue\r\nthis, till you observe a sufficient quantity of soot collected; always\r\nwetting the external side of the copper with a sponge dipped in cold\r\nwater. For thus all the soot will be fixed, when this is not too much\r\nheated: otherwise it would fly off again by reason of its lightness,\r\nand be mixed with the ashes of the thus.” Lib. i. cap. 85.\r\n\r\n11. _Sandarach._) This is the mineral sandarach, or red arsenic.\r\n\r\n12. _Gnidian berry._) Modern botanists are not agreed, what this\r\nberry of the ancients was; some taking it for the mezereon, or spurge\r\nolive, others for the spurge flax.\r\n\r\n13. _Omphacium._) Of this there were two kinds, the one the juice of\r\nunripe olives, and the other the juice of unripe grapes. Plin. lib.\r\nxii. cap. 27.\r\n\r\n14. _Copper-scales._) This must be an interpolation, as in this same\r\nchapter, which mentions only the class of cleansers, it occurred before.\r\n\r\n15. _Calcined copper._) The metal was calcined by being put\r\ninto a pot, _stratum super stratum_, with sulphur and salt.--Or\r\nelse the copper was kept for several days in the fire in a pot by\r\nitself.--Others again added allum to it, or sulphur alone, which last\r\ngave it a sooty colour.--It was washed in a mortar, and the water\r\nchanged four times a day, till no froth arose in it. Dioscorid. lib. v.\r\ncap. 861.\r\n\r\n16. _Apronitre._) The spume or froth of nitre was of a purplish\r\ncolour, and the lighter the better. It had the same virtues with\r\nnitre.--Id. lib. v. cap. 905.\r\n\r\n17. _Chrysocolla._) I have here retained the original word, because\r\nnaturalists are not agreed, that it was the modern borax. Dioscorides\r\nsays the Armenian is the best, and in colour it resembles leeks.--What\r\nis full of earth and stones is to be rejected. Lib. v. c. 878.\r\n\r\n18. _Cyprus ashes._ _Cinis Cyprius._) I do not remember that this is\r\nmentioned by any other ancient author; but it has probably been the\r\nashes of the tree or plant of this name, or perhaps some particular\r\nkind of ashes brought from the island of Cyprus.\r\n\r\n19. _Cadmia._) The best is the Cyprian, called botryitis, solid,\r\nmoderately heavy, being clustered like a bunch of grapes, of the colour\r\nof spodium, and being broken it appears cineritious and eruginous\r\nwithin. There are other kinds of it inferior, known by the names\r\nonychitis, zonitis, and ostracitis. For burning cadmia it is hid in\r\nlive coals, till it grows diaphanous, and runs into bubbles like the\r\nscoria of iron; afterwards it is extinguished in Aminæan wine. Some\r\nburn it thus three times, till it be perfectly converted into ashes;\r\nand then they use it instead of spodium. It is washed in a mortar, and\r\nthe water changed, till no dross appears on the top. Dioscorid. lib. v.\r\ncap. 858.--I have here mentioned particularly the burning and washing\r\nof cadmia, because it may serve to shew the nature of this process in\r\nother minerals, when our author prescribes such; and Dioscorides in\r\nmentioning them often refers to cadmia as the general example.\r\n\r\n20. _Hypocistis_ grows near the roots of cistus. The juice of it is\r\ninspissated like the acacia; and it has the same qualities. Dioscorid.\r\nlib. i. cap. 128.\r\n\r\n21. _Diphryges._) This is not known in medicine at present.\r\nDioscorides says ‘there are three species of it. One of the metallic\r\nkind found only in Cyprus, which is first dried in the sun, and then\r\nburnt by laying sticks all round it. Whence its name from being twice\r\ntorrified. A second kind is found at the bottom of the copper furnaces\r\nafter smelting. The third is the pyrites stone calcined for several\r\ndays in a furnace, till it have the colour of cinnabar. The taste of\r\ndiphryges is eruginous, astringent, and vehemently drying upon the\r\ntongue.’ Lib. v. cap. 894.\r\n\r\n22. _Salamander._) Our author here intends the animal so called, and\r\nDioscorides ascribes to it this virtue. It was burnt and the ashes made\r\nuse of. Lib. ii. cap. 255.\r\n\r\n23. _Flower of copper._) _Flos æris_ is obtained, when the melted\r\ncopper runs from the furnace, by pouring cold water upon it to\r\nrefrigerate it. For by the sudden check, this substance is as it were\r\nspued out, and concretes into flowers. Id. lib. v. cap. 862.\r\n\r\n24. _Spodium_ was scraped off the walls of furnaces mixed with\r\nsparks, and sometimes coals; that, which was generated in the gold\r\nfurnaces, was reckoned best for the eyes. Plin. lib. xxxiv. cap. 13.\r\n\r\n25. _Phrygian._) This was made use of by the dyers in Phrygia, whence\r\nits name. The best is pale-coloured and moderately ponderous, not firm\r\nin its concretions, and having white veins. Diosc. lib. v. cap. 915.\r\n\r\n26. _Scissile._) This is produced in the western Iberia. The best\r\nis of a saffron colour; easily broken and split; in its contexture it\r\nresembles the sal ammoniac. Dioscorid. lib. v. cap. 919.\r\n\r\n27. _Vinegar_ is superfluous, because mentioned before in the same\r\nchapter.\r\n\r\n28. _Burned paper._) It must be observed the paper of the ancients\r\nwas made from the papyrus or paper-reed.\r\n\r\n29. _Sansucus._) Dioscorides says this is the same with the amaracus,\r\nor sweet marjoram, which is the name given to _sansucus_ by the\r\nSicilians and people of Cyzicum. Lib. iii. cap. 452.\r\n\r\n30. _Asteriace._) I do not find that this word occurs any where else.\r\n\r\n31. _Eretrian earth_ is very white, or of an ash-colour: this last,\r\nand the soft is best. Dioscorid. lib. v. cap. 945.\r\n\r\n32. _Poppy-tears._) Dioscorides after describing the _papaver\r\nsativum_ and its virtues, says, ‘It is not improper to subjoin the\r\nmethod in which the _opos_ or _juice_ of it is collected. Some then\r\ncutting the poppy heads with the leaves, squeeze them through a press,\r\nand rubbing them in a mortar, form them into troches. This is called\r\n_meconium_, and is weaker than the _opos_. But whoever desires to\r\ngather the juice, must proceed thus. After the heads are moistened with\r\ndew, let him cut round the asterisk with a knife, but not penetrate\r\nthrough them, and from the sides, cut straight lines in the surface,\r\nand draw off the tear that flows, with his finger, into a shell; and\r\ncome again not long after, for it will be found standing upon it; and\r\nthe day following, it will be found in the same manner. It is proper\r\nto rub it in a mortar, and forming it up, to set it by.’ Dioscorid.\r\nlib. iv. cap. 647.--Pliny says, that the meconium is prepared from a\r\ndecoction of the heads and leaves; but is much weaker than opion. Lib.\r\nxx. cap. 18.\r\n\r\nFrom this account it seems plain, that our author means the genuine\r\ntear, or the opos of Dioscorides.\r\n\r\n33. _Antimony._ _Stimmi_, and in other places of our author\r\n_stibium_.) Dioscorides’s description of this shews it to be the modern\r\nantimony, lib. v. cap. 873.\r\n\r\n34. _Dross of lead._) This is glassy, and has the same virtues as\r\ncalcined lead. If is washed in a mortar like other minerals. Dioscorid.\r\nlib. v. cap. 878.\r\n\r\n35. _Matter._ _Materia._) This is not meant here of pus, as will\r\nappear by what the author immediately adds; but any humour, that is the\r\nproximate cause of a disease.\r\n\r\n36. _Struthium._) This was an herb used by dyers. Dioscorides says\r\nit was well known. The wool-washers make use of it for cleansing wool:\r\nthe root of it is pungent and diuretic, and relieves in disorders of\r\nthe liver, &c. Lib. ii. cap. 381.--This herb is not known now, at\r\nleast by the same name. Some take it for the luteola, others for the\r\nimperatoria, others for red valerian, others for saponaria.\r\n\r\n37. _Nard ointment._) For making this, oil is inspissated with\r\ncyperus, and for the fragrancy is added costus, amomum, nard, myrrh,\r\nbalsam. Dioscorid. lib. i. cap. 76.\r\n\r\n38. _Cachrys_ is the fruit of the _libanotis fructifera_, which is by\r\nsome called zea or campsanema, and has leaves like fennel, but thicker\r\nand broader, roundish, and creeping on the ground; the stalk, about a\r\ncubit or more in length; the fruit has a heating quality, very drying,\r\nwhence it is good mixed with ointments against rheums of the eyes.\r\nDioscorid. lib. iii. cap. 492. et 93.\r\n\r\n39. _Viscum_, bird-lime.\r\n\r\n40. _Ammoniacum thymiama._) According to Constantine, this is nothing\r\nelse than gum ammoniac. I forbear to mention the conjectures of others,\r\nthat seem to be not well founded. Paulus Ægineta says, it is an opos,\r\nor juice, endued with such an emollient virtue as to discuss schirri\r\nand tophi. Lib. vii.\r\n\r\n41. _Crocomagma._) This was the refuse left after the expression of\r\nthe oil in making the crocine ointment; which, besides retaining some\r\nof the virtues of saffron, would also be in some measure impregnated,\r\nwith the aromatics used in the composition of that ointment. Vide Plin.\r\nlib. xxi. cap. 20. et Dioscorid. lib. i. cap. 26.\r\n\r\n42. _Thapsia._) According to Dioscorides’s description and account\r\nof its virtues, it seems to be the modern thapsia, or turpethum\r\ngarganicum, deadly carrot. Vide Dioscorid. lib. iv. cap. 739.\r\n\r\n43. _Washed lead_ was thus prepared.--Put water into a leaden mortar,\r\nand rub it with a lead pestle, till the water becomes black and\r\nfeculent; then strain it through a linen cloth, pouring water upon it,\r\nthat all that is dissolved may be strained; and repeat this till you\r\nhave a sufficient quantity. Then suffer it to settle, pouring water\r\nupon it several times, till no more blackness stand upon the top; then\r\nwork it up into a troches and set it by. Dioscorid. lib. v. cap. 869.\r\n\r\n44. _Cedria_ is what distils from the cedar-tree; the best is thick,\r\npellucid, and of a strong smell, and not diffusing itself when poured\r\nout. Dioscorid. lib. i. cap. 106.\r\n\r\n45. _Laurel oil._) This was made in different ways. One method was\r\nboiling the berries in water when they fall off the tree, which causes\r\nthem to emit their oil, which is separated by the hands into _shells_.\r\nOthers impregnate the oil of unripe olives with cyperus, calamus,\r\nand afterwards putting in the tender leaves of the laurel, boil\r\nthem together. Others add to these bay-berries, till the oil smell\r\nsufficiently of them. Others mix with it storax and myrrh. Dioscorides,\r\nlib. i. cap. 50.\r\n\r\n46. _Rasile verdigrease_ is made by suspending a copper vessel, or\r\nplate, over the steam of vinegar for ten days; then the verdigrease\r\nproduced is scraped off. Or else by putting one or more lumps or plates\r\nof copper into husks of grapes grown sour. Dioscorid. lib. v. cap. 865.\r\n\r\n47. _Oesypum_ is the oily part collected from sordid wool thus: the\r\nwool was washed in warm water, and all its sordes expressed, the fat\r\nswimmed a-top, with a froth, and upon throwing in some sea water, it\r\nsubsided to the bottom, and when all the œsypum was obtained from it in\r\nthis manner, it was purified by repeated affusions of water. When pure\r\nit has no sharp taste, but is in some degree astringent, and appears\r\nwhite. It has a heating quality, fills up ulcers, and is emollient.\r\nDioscorid. lib. ii. cap. 272.\r\n\r\n48. _Boiled copperas._) Dioscorides mentions a species prepared\r\nin Spain that had the name of χάλκανθον ἑφθὸν--_atramentum sutorium\r\ncoctum_. Lib. v. cap. 888.\r\n\r\n49. _Cicine._) A proper quantity of κροτωνὼν, _of the Ricinus_, is\r\ndried in the sun, till their exterior coat break and fall off. Then the\r\npulp is collected, put into a mortar, and pounded well, and afterwards\r\nremoved into a tinned kettle containing water, and boiled over a fire.\r\nWhen all the juice is obtained from them, remove the vessel from the\r\nfire, and take up the oil that swims a-top, and set it by. In Egypt,\r\nwhere great use is made of this oil, they obtain it by first grinding\r\nthe seed, and then pressing it. Dioscorid. lib. i. cap. 38.\r\n\r\n50. _Burnt ceruss._) Put powdered ceruss into a deep vessel; set\r\nit on the fire, stirring it with a ferula, till it has the colour\r\nof sandaracha, (red arsenick). Dioscorides also mentions a toasted\r\nor roasted ceruss, but the process is of the same nature, and only\r\nstopped, when the ceruss acquires a lemon colour. Dioscorid. lib. v. c.\r\n877.\r\n\r\n51. _Polybus._) I have chosen to read this name with the older\r\neditions, because our author afterwards mentions the sphragis of\r\nPolybus, which can have no other place to refer to but this.\r\n\r\n52. _Cauneæ._) Mentioned by Cicero, De Divinatione, lib. 2.\r\n\r\n53. _Susine ointment._) For making this, oil was first boiled with\r\nwine, calamus, and myrrh, and after being strained, cardamom was\r\ninfused in it, til it gave a proper flavour, After this, to three and\r\nan half pound of this oil were added the leaves of a thousand lilies,\r\nand the whole was stirred with hands anointed with honey. After\r\nstanding a day and a night, the lilies were squeezed out. Dioscorid.\r\nlib. i. c. 63.\r\n\r\n54. _If a woman does not conceive._) _Si non comprehendit._ This\r\nsentence has, in some copies, been joined with the former, _si\r\nconcidere vitio locorum, &c._ as if _comprehendit_ related to the\r\nconsistence of the pessus obtained by the honey. There are several\r\nother explanations offered, but none of them with any appearance of\r\ntruth. I thought it capable of no other sense than what I have given\r\nin the translation; and was pleased to find this supported by the\r\nopinion of Morgagni, Ep. i. p. 18.\r\n\r\n55. _Sprinkled on dry._) The words as they stand in the text,\r\nseem capable of no proper sense. _Misy quoque et galla, si paribus\r\nportionibus misceantur, corpus consumunt: eaque vel arida inspergere\r\nlicet, vel excepta cadmia, illinere._ I have therefore taken the\r\nliberty to transpose _cadmia_, and place it after _galla_ for the\r\ncadmia is as dry as the other two, and therefore could not serve to\r\nbring them to any consistence; but still there seems to be a word\r\nwanting after _excepta_, to denote the substance for uniting them.\r\n\r\n56. _Marmor coctum._) I suppose this to be burnt marble; for\r\nDioscorides mentions a lapis alabastrites, which was burnt, and mixed\r\nwith resin or pitch, and thus used to discuss hardnesses. Lib. v. c.\r\n927.\r\n\r\n57. _Ignis sacer._) Some, among whom is Heister[JF], believes,\r\nthat Celsus calls an erysipelas _ignis sacer_, whereas he has\r\nerysipelas under its own name, cap. 26. of this book.--Fabricius[JG]\r\nab Aquapendente, and Wiseman[JH], by his _ignis sacer_ understand the\r\nmiliary herpes. See our author’s description of it, cap. 28.\r\n\r\n  [JF] Chirurg. p. i. lib. iv. cap. 6.\r\n\r\n  [JG] Oper. Chirurg. lib. i. cap. 18.\r\n\r\n  [JH] Book i. chap. 17.\r\n\r\n58. _Malabathrum._) It is a question, whether the modern malabathrum,\r\nor Indian leaf, is the same with the ancient. Dioscorides says, some\r\nwill have it to be the leaf of Indian nard being deceived by the\r\nsimilarity of its smell. But that is not true; for it is a vegetable of\r\na peculiar nature, growing in the fens of India, without any root, the\r\nleaves swimming on the surface of the water. Lib. i. cap. 11.\r\n\r\n59. _Black cassia_ is the second species mentioned by Dioscorides,\r\nwho says it is preferable to the first, and fittest for medicinal use;\r\nthe natives of Arabia call it zigir; it is thick, and smells like\r\nroses. Lib. i. cap. 12.\r\n\r\n60. _Myrrh called stacte_ was the oily part expressed from particular\r\nkinds of myrrh, and was very fragrant. Dioscorid. lib. i. c. 78.\r\n\r\n61. _Pontic root._) Dale, with Alpinus, believes the rhapontic of the\r\nancients to be the same with the true rhapontic of the moderns.\r\n\r\n62. See note at chap. 24. book iv.\r\n\r\n63. _Sil._) Rhodius, together with Constantine and Ronsseus, are for\r\nreading _seselis_ instead of _silis_, for sil is a species of ochre;\r\nand they take it for the _seseli Creticum_, or _tordylium_, _hartwort\r\nof Candy_.\r\n\r\n63a. _Between the fingers. Vel inter digitos._) Morgagni observes,\r\nthat, instead of these words, his MS. and all his editions read _In\r\narticulis_ which the reader, he says, cannot wonder at, if he considers\r\nwhat follows concerning the difficulty of curing wounds in the joints,\r\np. 297. of the original. Ep. 6. p. 144.\r\n\r\n64. _Fibulæ._) The word _fibula_, in other classical authors is\r\ntranslated by a _buckle_; which from its connection in such places\r\nappears very proper. But upon comparing the several passages in our\r\nauthor, where the use of them is directed, it seems very difficult to\r\ngive any account of them. The variety of opinions may very well be\r\nreduced to two, those of Guido de Cauliaco and Fallopius. The first\r\nbelieved them to be hooks, whose size was adapted to that of the\r\nwounded member, curved at both ends in the form of the letter S, that\r\nthey might be fixed to both lips of the wound. According to Fallopius\r\nthe _fibula_ was nothing else but the interrupted suture now commonly\r\nused in wounds.\r\n\r\nFabricius was at first of opinion, that the fibula was not made of\r\nthread, but copper or iron, not hard, as Guido would have it, but\r\nsofter and flexible, that it might be fixed through the lips of the\r\nwound and then twisted. But after mature consideration, he says he\r\nfound Fallopius’s opinion to be most agreeable to truth.\r\n\r\nRhodius in his treatise _de Acia_, where his design is only to clear up\r\n_the fibula and acia of Celsus_, has been at immense pains to collect\r\nevery thing extant in any of the ancients about their _fibulæ_; but\r\nas there is nothing which occurs in any of the old physicians more\r\nparticular than in our author, it is not to be wondered, that every\r\nthing in his treatise of real importance to the scope of his enquiry,\r\nis contained in Fabric. ab Aquapendente, lib. ii. de Vulnerib. cap. 5.\r\net de Chirurgic. Operation. cap. 108.\r\n\r\nThe principal places, in which our author mentions _fibulæ_, are lib.\r\nv. cap. 26. p. 292. in the original, p. 293.--Lib. 7. cap. 4. p.\r\n412.--Cap. 19. p. 462. et 464.--Cap. 22. p. 469.--Cap. 25. p. 473.\r\n\r\nThe difficulty seems to rest here, that our author should use the\r\nterm _fibula_, which in other classical authors is always taken for a\r\nbuckle, or something of that kind made of metal, without distinguishing\r\nit from the ordinary _fibula_, as one should imagine he would have\r\ndone, had he intended thread. Could it be a metal wire with a loop at\r\none end, and the other first put through the wound, then passed into\r\nthe loop, and twisted; which it would be easier to cut than pull out?\r\nThis seems to obviate the strongest objection against its being of\r\nmetal, drawn from the verb _incido_, which some moderns would have only\r\napplicable to thread.\r\n\r\nRhodius _de Acia_, cap. 6. will have the _fibula_ used to the prepuce\r\nof boys (mentioned by our author lib. vii. cap. 25.) to be of metal;\r\nand according to Joann. Britannicus a small ring either of silver,\r\ngold, or copper.\r\n\r\nI have only to add, that instead of _paulatim_ according to Linden and\r\nAlmeloveen, I have read _paulum_ with Pinzi, Junta, Aldus, and others.\r\n\r\n65. _Soft thread_, _acia molli_.) _Acia_ occurs no where else but\r\nin this single place of Celsus; the translation is agreeable to the\r\nsentiments of Rhodius _de Acia_, cap. 14. and I think it capable of\r\nno other sense. It may not be improper however to observe, that in\r\nsome copies, though they are not of the best authority, _acu_ is read\r\ninstead of _acia_, but with no apparent meaning.\r\n\r\n66. _After applying._) I read with Constantine _imposito_ for\r\n_impositum_, which last has no place in the construction with a proper\r\nsense.\r\n\r\n67. _And the flesh within is corrupted._) Malique odoris est, _et\r\ncaro intus corrupta_. All the editions of Morgagni[JI] have _carunculæ\r\ncorruptae_, and the MS, _carunculaeque corruptae_, which Morgagni likes\r\nbetter; because it would have been to no purpose to have repeated _caro\r\nejus corrupta_, which had occurred only a few lines before; whereas\r\nwith the other reading, we expunge the colon, and make _carunculae_\r\nrelate to the verb _resolvuntur_.\r\n\r\n  [JI] Ep. 7. p. 206.\r\n\r\n68. _The skin a little farther off._) I have here followed the\r\nreading of the older editions, _ulterior_ instead of _deterior_ in\r\nLinden, which agrees much better with the sense of the whole passage.\r\nVide Morg. ep. 6. p. 149.\r\n\r\n69. _The skin is entire, but the flesh within._) Linden omits\r\n_integra cute_, which is in the older editions, and Morgagni’s\r\nMS[JJ].--As the sense seems to require it, I have taken it into the\r\ntranslation.\r\n\r\n  [JJ] E p. 6. p. 144.]\r\n\r\n70. _Almost all bites._) I read here, omnis _fere_ morsus, with\r\nNicolaus Junta and the Manutii, and not _feræ_, as Linden and\r\nAlmeloveen have it. For Celsus himself makes no distinction between\r\nvenenatos et non venenatos morsus.\r\n\r\n71. _Psylli._) Pliny, from the authority of Agatharchides, says,\r\nthere was a nation called Psylli, in whose bodies there was some humour\r\ndestructive to serpents, by the odour of which they stupified them.\r\nThey had a custom among them of exposing their children to the fiercest\r\nof these creatures, that they might try the chastity of their wives,\r\nthe serpents not flying from those, that were not of their blood. Plin.\r\nlib. vii. c. 2. This account of Pliny’s has no better foundation than\r\nother vulgar errors: but we may observe, our author was too curious an\r\nenquirer into nature to give credit to such fables.\r\n\r\n72. _Especially in Gaul._) The Gauls tinged their arrows in hunting\r\nwith hellebore, and cutting out the wound they made all round, they\r\npretended it made the flesh more tender. Plin. lib. xxv. c. 5.\r\n\r\n73. _Cerastes_, from κερας, a horn, is a serpent of one or two cubits\r\nin length, of a sandy colour in the body, and near the tail void of\r\nscales; upon its head something rises like horns, and the parts about\r\nthe belly are covered with scales, orderly disposed, which as it creeps\r\nalong makes a rustling noise like hissing. Æt. Tetrab. 4. Serm. 1. cap.\r\n28.\r\n\r\n74. _Dipsas_, a serpent called by that name, from the immoderate\r\nthirst, which is caused by its bite. It is found in maritime places, is\r\nabout a cubit in length, thick, and becoming gradually smaller towards\r\nthe tail. Id. cap. 22.\r\n\r\n75. _Hæmorrhois._) Paulus Ægineta tells us, persons bit by an\r\nhæmorrhois are tormented with pains, their bodies become short and\r\nsmall, there is a violent hæmorrhage from the wound, and if there is a\r\ncicatrix in any part of the body, it bursts and bleeds: the stools are\r\nbloody, the blood discharged is grumous, blood is brought up from the\r\nlungs by coughing; and being seized with a vomiting of blood they die\r\nimmediately. He adds, that remedies must be applied before the symptoms\r\nappear; for after they come on, all means are vain.\r\n\r\n76. _Chersydrus._) The name of this imports it to be an amphibious\r\nanimal, from χέρσος _terra_, and ὕδωρ _aqua_.\r\n\r\n77. _The Phalangium_ is unknown to Italy, and is of several kinds;\r\none like an ant, but much larger, with a red head, the rest of its\r\nbody black and variegated with white spots. The bite of this is worse\r\nthan that of a wasp. The Greeks gave this name also to two species of\r\nspiders, the lupus, and another downy with a large head. Plin. Nat.\r\nHist. lib. xxix. cap. 4.\r\n\r\n78. _Pastinaca fish_ was of the plani kind, and had a cartilage\r\ninstead of a spine. The aculeus, or κεντρὸν of this fish is a remedy\r\nfor the tooth-ach, as Dioscorides informs us, and Celsus himself\r\nmentions, lib. vi. cap 9. Dale calls it the poison fish, fire, or\r\nfierce flaw. The liver is said to be good against itching; in oil it\r\nremoves lichens and lepras.--This cleansing quality attributed to it,\r\nmakes it probable our author intends it here, for no such virtue is\r\nattributed to the water, or sea-parsnip.\r\n\r\n79. _Now this is a very bad kind._) One of the great sources of\r\ncorruption is a false punctuation; and as I could make no sense of\r\nthis sentence as it now stands, I have translated it agreeably to the\r\nfollowing; _Namque pessimum id genus est. Fereque primum id fit, quod\r\ncacoethes à Græcis nominatur._ As it stood before, the cacoethes was\r\ncalled the worst kind, which our author contradicts immediately, by\r\nsaying that no other species but that can be cured. Some of the older\r\neditions read _ob quæ_ for _namque_, that is, ‘Upon these accounts this\r\nis a very bad kind.’ Which appears to agree better with the context.\r\n\r\n80. _None of these can be removed but the cacoethes._) Here again\r\nthe sense of the author is manifestly corrupted by the punctuation in\r\nLinden and Almeloveen; but Morgagni[JK] has set it to right in this\r\nmanner:--_Tolli nihil nisi cacoethes potest: reliqua curationibus\r\nirritantur; et quo major vis adhibita est, eo magis. Quidam usi sunt,\r\n&c._ The translation is conformable to this. Which reading is almost\r\nthe same with Constantine’s.\r\n\r\n  [JK] Ep. i. p. 36.\r\n\r\n81. _Of a good juice._) See book ii. chap. 20.\r\n\r\n82. _Probe._) One kind of the probe or _specillum_ of the ancients\r\nwas broad at one extremity for the purpose, which Celsus here mentions.\r\nVide Scultet. Armament. Chirurg. tab. 8. fig. 6.\r\n\r\n83. _Chironian._) So called, says Paulus Ægineta, because it requires\r\na very great physician, such as Chiron. Lib. iv. cap. 46.\r\n\r\n84. _These are the methods prescribed by physicians._) This\r\ntranslation is agreeable to the reading of the most ancient editions,\r\nparticularly Nicolaus, Pinzi, Junta, and Aldus. _Quæ cum medici\r\ndoceant, quorundam rusticorum, &c._ In Linden and Almeloveen the\r\npassage has a quite different turn: _Quæ cum medici doceant, ab\r\niis requirenda. Quorundam, &c._--That is, ‘These being the methods\r\nprescribed by physicians, they will be best practised under their\r\ndirection.’\r\n\r\n85. _Leaven._) The common leaven for bread among the Romans was paste\r\nworked up without salt, and boiled after the manner of pulticula, then\r\nsuffered to stand till it turned sour. Plin. lib. xviii. cap. 11.\r\n\r\n86. _From its figure, our authors call it panus._) _Panus_, a clue\r\nor ball of wool or yarn; πη̃νος, or πα̃νος the Greeks used in the same\r\nsense, but did not apply it, as the Romans did, to this tumour.\r\n\r\n87. _The same applications._) I have here followed the reading of\r\nPinzi Manut. Ruell. Stephens and Morgagni’s MS. autem for _aut_, and\r\n_tantum modo_ for _tantummodo_. Morgagni, Ep. vi. p. 156.\r\n\r\n88. _If it does not slip out, &c._) Almeloveen and Linden read, _si\r\nnon dilabitur sede, qua innititur_; whereas the prior editions wrote,\r\n_si non labitur, sede quale innititur_; i. e. ‘if it does not slide,\r\nbut rests upon a smooth surface.’ This Morgagni[JL] likes much better,\r\nas agreeable to Celsus himself, who adds, _si inæquale quoque et\r\nasperum_, &c, that is, in the first case where the probe rested, but\r\nupon a plain surface, the caries was but little advanced; whereas under\r\nthe following appearances it was more considerable.\r\n\r\n  [JL] Ep. vi. p. 162.\r\n\r\n89. _Collyrium._) This name, at present, is appropriated to medicines\r\ndesigned for the eyes; in which sense the ancients also used it. But\r\nthey gave it a greater latitude, to denote likewise a composition\r\nof powders brought to a consistence by some liquid, and formed into\r\nsomething like a tent, of various sizes, according to the cavities it\r\nwas designed for. Thus Scribonius Largus orders a collyrium of the\r\nbigness of a pine kernel, to be introduced into the anus, Cap. xxxvii.\r\ncomp. 142.\r\n\r\n90. _Which is more ulcerated._ _Quæ magis exulcerata est._) Several\r\nof the ancient editions read _quia_ for _quæ_, that is, ‘Because it is\r\nmore ulcerated.’\r\n\r\n91. _Spreads wide._) This whole passage was very much corrupted in\r\nthe old editions. We are obliged to Linden for several corrections in\r\nit; but he reads this part _Proceditque et latet_, that is, _It spreads\r\nand conceals itself_. As this can hardly be the meaning of the author,\r\nI read _Procedit latè_, which is in Pinzi, Junta, Aldus, and others;\r\nonly I take the liberty of expunging _et_.\r\n\r\n92. _Cimolian chalk._) I have here kept close to the author’s term\r\n_subcærulea_. Pliny and Dioscorides describe this kind as inclining to\r\npurple. See note book ii. chap. 33.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTES\r\n\r\nTO\r\n\r\nBOOK VI.\r\n\r\n\r\n2. _Gum._) Our author here manifestly distinguishes between _lachryma\r\nand pituita_. The ancients imagined the _pituita_ to be concreted\r\ntears, whereas it is the sebaceous matter secreted from the glands of\r\nMeibomius. To translate it in one word I have therefore given it the\r\nvulgar English name.\r\n\r\n3. _Phlegm._) Vid. lib. ii. cap. 23.\r\n\r\n4. _Diet ought to be somewhat fuller than formerly._) In Almeloveen\r\nand Linden, _Post hæc cibo pleniore, quam ex operum consuetudine_. The\r\nreading in the older editions was _ex eorum dierum consuetudine_, which\r\nMorgagni prefers, Ep. vi. p. 153. and is the reading I have followed.\r\n\r\n5. _Burnt antimony._) The antimony is rubbed over with suet, and hid\r\nin the fire till the suet is burnt, and then being taken out, it is\r\nextinguished in the milk of a woman, that has had a male child, or in\r\nold wine. Dioscorid. lib. v. c. 873.\r\n\r\n6. _Specillum asperatum._) Paulus Ægineta, treating of the same\r\ndisorder, mentions this instrument by the name of _blepharoxyston_,\r\nthat is, _an instrument for scraping the eye-lids_. It is delineated by\r\nHeister, p. 2. tab. 16. fig. 5.\r\n\r\n7. _Psoricum._) Dioscorides gives the same process for making of\r\npsoricum: only he orders the vessel to be buried in dung for forty\r\ndays, about the heats of the dog star. Lib. v. cap. 890.\r\n\r\n8. _Hot waters._) By our author’s using the plural number here, it\r\nmay be doubted, whether he does not intend mineral hot waters.\r\n\r\n9. _Strigil._) This is used by other authors to signify a currycomb,\r\nor that instrument, with which the sordes were scraped off the skin at\r\nthe baths; but in this place it can be taken for nothing else but a\r\ntube or syringe.\r\n\r\n10. The _specillum oricularium_, from its use here, as well as in\r\nother places, must have been some kind of forceps.\r\n\r\n11. _A board is laid down._) I could make no proper sense of this\r\nsentence according to the present pointing, and therefore have altered\r\nthe punctuation in this manner; _tabula quoque collocatur, media\r\ninhærens, capitibus utrinque pendentibus, &c._\r\n\r\n12. The _teda_ is a tree very like the pine, abounding with resin.\r\nPliny says, that all the trees, that afford resin, by an excess of fat\r\nare changed into the teda. Hence teda is often used for a torch in\r\nLatin authors. Vid. Plin. Nat. Hist. lib. xvi. c. 10. & lib. xvii. c.\r\n24.\r\n\r\n13. _Sory_ was a mineral of much the same virtues as _misy_ and\r\n_chalcitis_: it is strong scented, and creates a nausea. It is produced\r\nin Egypt, Africa, Spain, and Cyprus. Dioscorid. lib. v. c. 893.\r\n\r\n14. _Rhus_ is a shrub growing in rocky places, of about two cubits\r\nin length; it has long leaves, and reddish, the fruit of it is like\r\na grape stone. The bark about is very useful: it has a styptick\r\nquality, and is used for the same purposes as acacia. It was used by\r\nthe tanners. Dioscorid. lib. i. c. 138. It is supposed to be rhus\r\nobsoniorum, or sumach of the moderns.\r\n\r\n15. _In the inner part._) For _ulteriore_ in Almeloveen, I chuse to\r\nread with Constantine _interiore_.\r\n\r\n16. _In nine cyathi._) There is no liquid mentioned in Linden’s or\r\nAlmeloveen’s edition, but most of the others have _Ex novem cyathis\r\nvini_.\r\n\r\n17. _That the skin be kept from falling in contact, &c._) This\r\nis agreeable to the reading of Linden and Almeloveen, _Illam esse\r\nservandam ne considat, ulcerique agglutinetur_. But [JM] Morgagni would\r\nhere restore the reading of his editions and the MS. _Illam non esse\r\nservandam ne considat_, &c. that is, ‘It must always be cut off in\r\nsuch a case;’ which indeed is rendered probable by our author’s first\r\nordering circumcision, when there is a loss of substance in the penis;\r\nand then his adding _Perpetuumque est_, as if that were a general rule\r\nfor the same operation in like circumstances.\r\n\r\n  [JM] Ep. 6. p. 145.\r\n\r\n18. _Vulsella._) This instrument is delineated by Scultet. Arm.\r\nChirurg. tab. 4. fig. 1.\r\n\r\n19. _Cicatrix is formed._ _Fit cicatrix._) I find no variety in any\r\nof the copies, which I have seen. The sense however seems to require\r\n_crusta_ instead of _cicatrix_; because the caustic medicines would\r\nproduce an eschar, whereas no cicatrix would be formed, till the eschar\r\ncast off, and the ulcer was deterged and incarned.\r\n\r\n20. _Consumed either by stronger medicines, &c._) This is agreeable\r\nto the reading of the older editions--_Si hac ratione non tollitur:\r\nvel medicamentis vehementioribus, vel ferro adurendum est._--Linden\r\nand Almeloveen have it thus: _Si hac ratione non tollitur, vel aliis\r\nmedicamentis similibus, vel vehementioribus: ferro adurendum est_.\r\nThat is, ‘If it is not removed by this method, or like medicines, or\r\nstronger, it must be burnt by the actual cautery.’ Which, Morgagni[JN]\r\njustly observes, besides the incongruity of recommending similar\r\nmedicines after the first have failed, alters the sense much for the\r\nworse.\r\n\r\n  [JN] Ep. vi. p. 146.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTES\r\n\r\nTO\r\n\r\nBOOK VII.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. _Physician makes a wound._) An English reader may naturally\r\nsuppose that the term should be _surgeon_; but as our author here uses\r\nthe word _medicus_, I did not think myself at liberty to depart from\r\nit; especially as his not using _chirurgus_ was from choice, since\r\nthis word occurred in the preceding paragraph. Celsus supposes an\r\naccomplished physician acquainted with all the branches.\r\n\r\n2. _Nevertheless, it is not right to trust, &c._) In this translation\r\nI have followed Linden and Almeloveen. But the reading in most of the\r\nold editions, as Nicolaus, Pinzi, Junta, Aldus, Gryphius, &c. is _Neque\r\ntamen fas non est nihil cucurbitula agere_; that is, ‘Yet it is not an\r\ninviolable rule always to employ the cupping-vessel.’ Which I must own,\r\nappears most agreeable to the sense of this place; because our author\r\nimmediately proceeds to consider a case, in which cupping can be of no\r\nservice. See Morg. Ep. vi. p. 151.\r\n\r\n3. _Even before the suppuration is formed._) I have here followed the\r\nold reading, _tum pure quoque maturior hæc interdum esse consuevit_,\r\nwhich seems to agree better with our author’s reasoning; for as he\r\nhad just blamed Meges for introducing the new term _callus_ instead\r\nof _tunica_, without necessity; so he adds, that he was mistaken also\r\nin believing that it was never found but inclosing an old collection\r\nof matter. He on the contrary says, that it sometimes appears before\r\nthe generation of pus. Linden and Almeloveen read _tum, pure quoque\r\nmaturiore, hæc interdum esse consuevit_; that is, ‘And this is found,\r\neven when the suppuration is more ripened.’ Whether the connexion\r\nof this with what went before be natural, the reader may judge for\r\nhimself. I do not know but these learned editors may have put another\r\nsense upon _maturiore, when the suppuration is sooner ripened_: which\r\nwould be pretty much the same with the old reading. However the first\r\nis preferred by Morgagni, Ep. vi. p. 152.\r\n\r\n4. _Lest convulsions follow, which may debilitate, &c._) This\r\ntranslation is agreeable to the reading in Linden and Almeloveen; but\r\nall the older editions read thus, _ne vel distendantur hi, vel membrum\r\ndebilitent_; i. e. ‘Lest either convulsions follow, or the limb be\r\ndisabled.’ And this appears the more probable, as one of them might\r\nhappen without the other following. And so it is quoted by Fabricius ab\r\nAquapendente.\r\n\r\n5. _And some again require a wound, &c._) _Jamque alia rectam plagam\r\ndesiderant, ut in carne: alia vero vehementer cutem extenuant, in\r\nquibus tota ea super pus excidenda est._ There are several variations\r\nin the reading of the copies of this paragraph, but they do not remove\r\nthe difficulty. Morgagni[JO] very ingeniously conjectures, that after\r\nCelsus had considered such as were quite mature, he next mentioned\r\nsuch as were not quite ripe; and did not talk here of cutting off the\r\nwhole skin, because he afterwards says, _Est etiam in rerum natura, ut\r\ncutis latius excidenda sit_; and that what is here said of the skin\r\nbeing extenuated, was repeated from above by carelessness. All the old\r\neditions and MSS. have _itemque_ for _jamque_; none of them _ut_; the\r\nMS. _tuto_ for _tota_. Upon the whole, he seems inclined to read it\r\nthus: _Itemque alia rectam plagam desiderant in carne; in quibus tuto\r\nea super pus incidenda sit_; i. e. ‘Others again require a wound in a\r\nstraight direction in the flesh, in which it may be proper and safe to\r\nmake an incision above the pus.’\r\n\r\n  [JO] Ep. vii. p. 181.\r\n\r\n6. _Crude lint._) Fabricius ab Aquapendente and Rhodius take this\r\ncrude lint to be such as has not been boiled in a lixivium.\r\n\r\n7. _Loosing this knot. Soluto nodo._) Morgagni[JP] here prefers\r\nthe old reading, _salvo nodo_, _without loosing the knot_, for this\r\nreason, that our author immediately orders the knot to be loosed every\r\nthird day, for changing the string. And thus also it is quoted by\r\nAquapendente, De chirurg. operation. cap. 93.--Celsus has here followed\r\nHippocrates, Lib. de fistul. where he orders the string to be drawn\r\nand twisted every day, as much as it is loosened by the putrefaction\r\nof the fistula; but he says nothing of untying the knot every day.\r\nThe difference is not material; for if _salvo nodo_ be the reading,\r\nthe string must be made tighter in the manner Hippocrates directs.\r\nAccording to the reading of Linden, the method is plain, nor does it\r\nseem to be attended with any difficulty; for it is untied twice a day\r\nto move the ligature; and also untied every third day, for the sake of\r\nintroducing a fresh ligature, because the old one must not be suffered\r\nto rot.\r\n\r\n  [JP] Ep. vi. p. 151.\r\n\r\n8. _A very small habenula may be cut out._) Linden and Almeloveen\r\nread here, _habenula tenuis admodum injiciatur_, which I think has no\r\nproper connection either with what goes before or follows. It is true,\r\nAquapendente has given two explications of this passage, according to\r\nthe same reading, De chirurg. operat. cap. 93. Neither of which appears\r\nto me consistent with the reasons Celsus gives for this method: I have\r\ntherefore chosen to follow Nicolaus, Pachel, Pinzi, Junta, Aldus, and\r\nothers, who have _ejiciatur_ for _injiciatur_, which seems to clear up\r\nthe difficulties of this place.--Our author uses _habena_ often for a\r\nstrap; but by _habenula_ here he must understand a small slip or stripe\r\nof flesh.\r\n\r\n9. _Gum_ in this place (_pituita_) must signify a purulent fluid.\r\n\r\n10. _Like a spatha._) A knife was said to resemble a spatha, when\r\nit ended in an acute point with sharp edges on both sides, which\r\nour author mentions chap. x. for the excision of a polypus in the\r\nnose.--The needle here described is thin and broad, so that it was more\r\nlike this instrument than a common needle. Vid. Fabric. ab. Aquapend.\r\nde Oper. Chirurg. cap. 107.\r\n\r\n11. _Of the colour of wax._) I have here departed from the reading of\r\nall the copies, and instead of it admit the correction of Mercurialis\r\n_cereus_ for _cæruleus_, which is approved by the best judges, and\r\nseems to be confirmed by its affinity to the gold colour immediately\r\nfollowing. Vid. Mercurial. Var. Lect. lib. v. cap. 5. & Le Clerc. Hist.\r\nde la Medicine, p. 2. liv. 4. sect. 2. chap. 5.\r\n\r\n12. _The needle sharp pointed, but not too slender._) The reading in\r\nAlmeloveen is _Tum acus admovenda est, aut acuta, aut certe non nimium\r\ntenuis_. As I could find no sense from this reading, or any other that\r\nis proposed, I have taken the liberty to read thus, _Tum acus admovenda\r\nest acuta, at certe non nimium tenuis_.\r\n\r\n13. _With timidity._ _Timide._) Though this reading may be defended,\r\nyet as what our author adds of the needle finding no resistance should\r\nmake an operator more cautious, it is possible he wrote _temere_.\r\n\r\n14. _Below the bone._) I have here followed the old reading _sub\r\nosse_, and not as Almeloveen has it _ab osse_, which plainly appears\r\nto be erroneous by what our author says, when he mentions this species\r\nagain, _Manifestum sub osse descendere_.\r\n\r\n15. _Humour still flows._) Here is a manifest error in Linden and\r\nAlmeloveen, who read _tumor_ instead of _humor_, which all the old\r\ncopies have. Morgagni, ep. 5. p. 150.\r\n\r\n16. _And therefore cannot be separated._) In the original _Ideoque\r\nlegi non possunt_. Our author here barely mentions the _lectio\r\nvenarum_, and a little below speaks of it as a distinct operation in\r\nthese words, _Sed nihil melius est, quam quod in Gallia quoque comata\r\nsit, ubi venas in temporibus, et in superiore capitis parte legunt_.\r\nIn the conclusion of the chapter he promises a full explanation of it,\r\nwhen he comes to the varices of the legs. The place he refers to is the\r\n_31st_ chapter of this book, where the reader will find, he does not\r\nonce use the word _lego_ through the whole: not that he forgot it, for\r\nhe puts us in mind of this very passage in the beginning: _Huc autem et\r\nearum venularum, quæ in capite nocent,--curationem distuli_; he then\r\nproceeds to describe two methods of cure by the actual cautery, and\r\nexcision. In the first process I find nothing applicable to _lego_,\r\nthere as well as here, cauterizing being quite a different thing;\r\nbut in the second, namely the excision, the veins are separated from\r\nthe contiguous parts, and are taken up by several blunt hooks, at the\r\ndistance of four fingers breadth from each other, then, one of these\r\nhooks being raised, the vein is cut through and pulled away: so in\r\nall the rest (the terms are _Excipitur_, _diducitur_, _attrahitur_,\r\n_evellitur_, _rursus abscinditur_.) Now from the various senses, which\r\n_lego_ bears in the classics, it seems without a strain capable of\r\nsignifying any step of this operation. And as it is not uncommon among\r\nthe ancients to include several known consequences under one term, I\r\nmust own it appears to me our author intends them all, when he uses the\r\nword _lego_ in this chapter.\r\n\r\n17. _Through what remains._) Instead of _super est_ in Linden and\r\nAlmeloveen, which seems to be directly contrary to our author’s\r\nmeaning, I read in one word _superest_, with the older editions.\r\n\r\n18. _Defects in these three parts, if they be small, &c._) Linden\r\nand Almeloveen read _Curta igitur in his tribus, ac si qua parte parva\r\nsunt, &c._ The more ancient editions have _Ac si qua parva paria\r\nsunt_; neither of which seem to give the author’s meaning. I cannot\r\nhelp thinking the whole passage should run thus. _Curta igitur in his\r\ntribus, si qua parva sunt, curari possunt: si qua majora sunt, aut\r\nnon accipiunt curationem, &c._ For neither _paria_ nor _parte_ appear\r\nto be at all proper after what was said in the conclusion of the last\r\nchapter, where he expressly confined these defects to the three parts\r\nabovementioned. I have therefore ventured to translate according to\r\nthat reading; a liberty however I durst not take without advertising\r\nthe reader.\r\n\r\n19. _Sometimes however the skin--left deformed._) I have here\r\ntranslated according to the reading of Linden and Almeloveen, from\r\nwhich I find no other variety than that of _autem_ for _tamen_. But\r\nthis observation by no means agrees with the general rule contained in\r\nthe next words, _Hujusmodi loci altera pars incidenda, altera intacta\r\nhabenda est._ If we are allowed to reject _haud_, it will run thus:\r\n_Sometimes however it happens, that to draw forward the skin on one\r\nof the sides, would effectually disfigure the part it has left._ This\r\nsense appears quite consistent both with the general rule, _Hujusmodi\r\nloci, &c._ and its application, _Ergo ex imis auribus, &c._\r\n\r\n20. _Two regulæ._) _Regula_ is commonly taken for a ruler. Our author\r\nhimself directs a single regula to be applied to a fractured bone,\r\nwhere there is a protuberance, to keep that down, Lib. viii. cap. 10.\r\nIn this place he mentions the end proposed by them. It seems probable\r\nthat they were two pieces of wood fixed together by a hinge, and used\r\nin the same manner as farriers use the instrument by them called\r\nbarnacles.\r\n\r\n21. _In two lines._) Instead of _duæ tunicæ_, I read here with\r\nNicolaus, Aldus, Stephens, and others, _duæ lineæ_.\r\n\r\n22. _Small glands_, _Glandulis_.) Most of the old copies have instead\r\nof this word, _medullis_. But Aquapendente in quoting this place,\r\nfollows the same reading with Linden and Almeloveen.\r\n\r\n23. _The coats however, &c._) I have here followed the old reading\r\n_tunicæ_, for _tunicarum_ in Linden and Almeloveen. According to which\r\nthe translation would run, ‘They (_the testicles_) are pained however\r\nin wounds and inflammation of the coats, which contain them.’--Which\r\nmust appear quite inconsistent with what our author had said the line\r\nbefore, so that Morgagni[JQ] very properly asks how they can be void of\r\nall sensation, and yet be pained in diseases of their coats?\r\n\r\n  [JQ] Ep. v. p. 135.\r\n\r\n24. _By an assistant._) I read _ministro_ instead of _sinistro_,\r\nwhich is in Linden.--See Morgagni, Ep. vi. p. 147.\r\n\r\n25. _Sometimes upon account of their health._ _Interdum valetudinis\r\ncausa._) Some of the older editions insert before this, _Interdum\r\nvocis_, _Sometimes on account of their voice_. I do not know how this\r\ncame to be dropped afterwards: for it is certain this was one very\r\ncommon reason for infibulating.\r\n\r\n26. _Sticks where that grows narrower._) In Almeloveen and Linden,\r\n_Nonnunquam etiam prolapsus in ipsam fistulam calculus, qui subinde\r\nea extenuatur._-----Which I think is capable of no sense, and have\r\ntherefore taken the liberty to follow Morgagni’s conjecture _qua_ for\r\n_qui_. Ep. i. p. 38.\r\n\r\n27. _Being first slightly anointed with oil, &c._ _Leniter prius\r\nunctos oleo simul in anum ejus demittit._) The old editions, without\r\nany mention of the oil, have, _Leniter prius unum deinde alterum in\r\nanum ejus demittit_; that is, _Introduces gently the fore and middle\r\nfingers, first the one and then the other_.\r\n\r\n28. _Come out prone_, that is, _with its end foremost_, _ut pronus\r\nexeat_.) This Constantine changed in the margin into _Ut ne pronus\r\nexeat_, which Linden received into the text. Constantine explains\r\n_prone_ by lying on its side, and says it is hardly possible to extract\r\nan oblong stone in that posture, supposing, no doubt, that it must\r\nnecessarily lie across the orifice. See Morgagni, Ep. v. p. 128.\r\n\r\n29. _Then in that part where the bottom of the wound is straiter,\r\n&c._ _Deinde ea parte qua strictior ima plaga est._) Thus all the\r\nprinted copies read. This passage has given rise to a variety of\r\nopinions on the nature of the first and second wound: some imagining\r\nthat the first, which is called the lunated incision, was concave\r\ntowards the rectum; others, on the contrary, from the word _coxæ_\r\nbeing used for the ilia as well as the ischia, believed it was concave\r\ntowards the scrotum.\r\n\r\nThen, with respect to the transverse incision made through the neck of\r\nthe bladder, some have thought that the word transverse was used as\r\nit regarded the first wound, so that the second incision was nearly\r\nperpendicular to the first, and the urethra was divided longitudinally;\r\nothers again have supposed, that the incision was made transverse, with\r\nregard to the course of the urethra, that is, the neck of the bladder\r\nwas opened transversely.\r\n\r\nThough all the printed copies agree in the above reading, yet Morgagni\r\ninforms us that instead of _Qua strictior ima plaga est_, his ancient\r\nMS has _Qua resima plaga est_, which would determine the convexity of\r\nthe lunated incision to be towards the rectum; because in that case\r\nthe cornua of the lunated incision would point to the superior part of\r\nthe body. But this reading does not fix the direction of the _plaga\r\ntransversa_, whether it was called so in respect of the parts, or the\r\nfirst incision: nor does that ingenious author favour us with his own\r\nopinion, but seems to prefer this to the common reading. Ep. vii. p.\r\n189.\r\n\r\nNow it should seem almost certain, that the lunated incision was meant\r\nto be concave towards the rectum; because when made in that direction,\r\nit would probably render the rectum much more loose and supple, than it\r\nis in its natural state, and thereby greatly facilitate the operation,\r\nby allowing the surgeon a much freer use of the two fingers, which are\r\nintroduced into the rectum, and consequently admitting him to bring\r\nthe stone more easily forwards into the neck of the bladder. One would\r\nsuppose, however, that the benefit here suggested to arise from this\r\nlunated incision, was not extremely evident, or it would not have been\r\ndropped so early by succeeding surgeons: Ægineta makes not the least\r\nmention of this process, nor do we know when it was first discontinued.\r\nPerhaps, even in Celsus’s time, there were different methods of\r\nperforming this operation; for does not he himself, when describing\r\nMeges’s manner of cutting upon a rough stone, omit the lunated\r\nincision? And does he not imply that there were different methods by\r\nsaying, _Quocunque autem modo cervix ea parte secta est_, &c.?\r\n\r\nWith regard to the _transversa plaga_, it should seem by the use of\r\nthat term, when he describes the manner of cutting women, that it was\r\ntransverse with respect to the perineum; and indeed, it is natural to\r\nsuppose, when the stone was brought forward by the fingers, and the\r\nneck only of the bladder was to be cut, that the incision should be\r\nmade in that direction. But those, who contend that the _transversa\r\nplaga_ was made transverse with respect only to the first incision,\r\nmay urge, that Celsus in this very passage orders the incision of the\r\nneck of the bladder to be made so large, that the opening in the _iter\r\nurinæ_ may exceed the dimensions of the stone. If, therefore, Celsus in\r\nthis place intends that the urethra should be opened, one would suppose\r\nthe incision must be made according to the length of that canal; but I\r\nbelieve it may be questioned, whether Celsus is sufficiently accurate\r\nin his notions of the anatomy of these parts, to determine his meaning\r\nby that expression.\r\n\r\nIt is very remarkable, that how much soever this operation of Celsus’s\r\nmay have engaged the attention of later ages, neither Galen, Oribasius,\r\nnor Ægineta make the least mention of his method: nay Ægineta (lib.\r\nvi. cap. 60.) describes the cutting on the gripe nearly as it has been\r\npractised in our own age.\r\n\r\n30. _A crotchet_, in the original _uncus_.) Our author here describes\r\nthe instrument he mentions, and as the use is the same, and the form\r\nnot very different from that once employed by modern surgeons, I have\r\ntaken the liberty to use their term. But the reader will please to\r\nobserve, that this _uncus_ is different from that mentioned in chapter\r\nxxix. used in extracting a dead fœtus.\r\n\r\n31. _On the external part smooth._) As the ancient editions have\r\n_exteriori_, which is made extremely clear by our author’s description,\r\n_Qua corpori jungitur_, it is hardly worth while to observe that\r\n_interiori_ in Linden must be an error of the press.\r\n\r\n32. _Knees._) Other copies have _inguinibus_, instead of _in genibus_.\r\n\r\n33. _Which by pressing upon the bladder._) Instead of _Atque vesicam\r\nurgendo_, in Linden and Almeloveen, I read _Quæ vesicam urgendo_, with\r\nNicolaus, Pachel, Pinzi, and several other old editions.\r\n\r\n34. _Into the anus._ _In anum._) This is the reading of all the\r\ncopies, which I have seen; but it is highly probable our author\r\nwrote _colem_ for _anum_. For as I see no propriety in introducing a\r\npipe into the anus, so in the very case before us, a catheter in the\r\nurethra, is at present esteemed the best method of cure.\r\n\r\n35. _Sore places._) It appears that in this place, Celsus uses the\r\nword _cicatrix_ for a wound as well as a scar, of which I do not\r\nremember another instance in his work.\r\n\r\n36. _Which are brought to digestion._) I have here followed the\r\nold reading, _in quibus pus moveri debet_, because I think it more\r\nagreeable to our author’s practice.----Constantine had inserted _non_,\r\nin which he was followed by Linden and Almeloveen; he supported his\r\ncorrection by referring to p. 290. lib. 5. in the original, where\r\nCelsus gives directions about a hæmorrhage from wounds; but I own I can\r\nsee nothing there to incline me to his opinion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTES\r\n\r\nTO\r\n\r\nBOOK VIII.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. Morgagni[JR], with Paaw, thinks it probable, that there is some\r\nchasm in the text, because Celsus does not describe the coronal suture,\r\nwhich he could not be ignorant of.\r\n\r\n  [JR] Ep. 4. p. 91.\r\n\r\n2. _Over these muscles too, &c._ _Super bos quoque musculos, qui\r\ntempora contegunt, os medium, in exteriorem partem inclinatam, positum\r\nest._) Thus Linden and Almeloveen. All the other copies have, _sub\r\nhis musculis, qui tempora connectunt_; in the following words they\r\ndiffer, which Ronsseus would read thus, _os medium in interiorem partem\r\ninclinatam_; in this he was followed by Paaw, who was of opinion, that\r\nCelsus intended here the _processus petrosus_; which Morgagni thinks\r\nquite foreign to the question. It is probable, says the same author,\r\nthat Linden changed _sub his musculis_ into _super hos musculos_, to\r\nmake the description answer to the _processus zygomaticus_, which\r\nour author describes a little after, under the name of _jugale_. His\r\nown conjecture is, that Celsus wrote _sub his musculis, qui tempora\r\ncontinent_, and that he meant that part of the temporal bone which is\r\ncovered by the crotaphite muscle. Morgag. Ep. 7. p. 212. 214. But as\r\nthis description of a bone is inserted in the midst of the sutures,\r\nthere is some foundation to suspect the whole to be an interpolation.\r\n\r\n3. _The maxilla is a soft bone._ _Maxilla vero est molle os._) Thus\r\nall the editions read, but Morgagni[JS] suspects _molle_ should be\r\n_mobile, a moveable bone_; for Celsus himself calls the sternum a\r\nstrong and hard bone, which is not to be compared in that respect with\r\nthe maxilla.--It is no objection to this reading, that the author adds,\r\n_solaque ea movetur_, for that is to exclude the upper jaw-bone. The\r\nreader will please to observe, that maxilla, by our author, is applied\r\nonly to the lower jaw-bone, for he includes the upper jaw-bones under\r\nthe malæ.\r\n\r\n  [JS] Ep. 7. p. 211.\r\n\r\n4. _Is broader below._) I have here followed the proposed emendation\r\nof Morgagni, _infra_ for _intra_. Ep. 1. p. 40.\r\n\r\n5. _And all the vertebræ._) What follows relating to the structure\r\nand connection of the vertebræ, appears to be very much corrupted, in\r\nso much, that the reading in all the copies makes our author contradict\r\nhimself. I shall be content with mentioning some observations of\r\nMorgagni’s upon the reading of Linden. The words in the parenthesis\r\n(says he) _exceptis tribus summis_, _except the three uppermost_, were\r\nsurely never wrote by Celsus, at least not as they stand; for if the\r\nthree first vertebræ want depressions in their superior surfaces, how\r\ncomes the first to receive into its depressions the two small processes\r\nof the head, as our author immediately adds?\r\n\r\nThe adding of _parvis_ to _tuberibus_ he judges to be superfluous,\r\nbecause Celsus had said just before _exiguis ejus processibus_. He\r\nconjectures that _secunda superioris parti inferiori inseritur_ is\r\ninterpolated, because the connection is more natural without these\r\nwords. A little after follows _tertia eodem modo secundam excipit_, as\r\nif a process stood out from the inferior part of the second vertebra,\r\nto be surrounded by the third in the same manner, that its processus\r\ndentatus is surrounded by the first; so that all these five words he\r\nseems with justice inclined to expunge.\r\n\r\nAfter these Linden adds, _Jamque vertebra tertia tubercula, quæ\r\ninferiori inserantur, excipit_; which at first view must appear highly\r\nabsurd. I therefore have followed, in the translation, the reading of\r\nNicolaus, Pachel, Pinzi, Stephens, and Morgagni’s manuscript, _exigit_\r\nfor _excipit_.--See Morgagni Ep. vii. from 173 to 177.\r\n\r\n6. _The six inferior ones._) Almeloveen and Linden read here _septem_\r\ninferiores, others write _undecim_, as if the following description\r\nrelated to all the ribs. But that is false, as appears by the sequel,\r\nand it is plain, from the whole passage, our author could write nothing\r\nelse than _sex_.\r\n\r\n7. _But at the first rib, &c._) This whole paragraph is extremely\r\nobscure. The variation of reading in the older copies does not in\r\nthe least lessen the difficulty. If we were allowed to understand by\r\n_jugulum_, _the neck_, the whole description, lame as it is, could then\r\nanswer no bone but the _clavicle_; but _jugulum_ in no other place\r\nof this work seems to be used for any thing else but the _clavicle_,\r\nso that _id ipsum, &c._ would appear to be the beginning of the\r\ndescription of that bone.--Morgagni thinks, that though the description\r\nis far from just, yet that most of the words, as they now stand,\r\nrelate to the _spine of the scapula_, which may be said to sustain the\r\nclavicle; and it is observable, that if our author does not intend the\r\n_spina scapulæ_ here, he makes no mention of it at all. Vide Morgagni,\r\nEp. vii. p. 177. I must own the reading appears to me so much depraved,\r\nthat it is impossible to determine, precisely, what our author has had\r\nin view.\r\n\r\n8. _Is a little concave, &c._) This translation follows Linden and\r\nAlmeloveen. In all the other copies the reading is _leniter gibbus,\r\net in priorem et posteriorem, interiorem et exteriorem partem_, as if\r\nthe bone was concave on no side. Morgagni[JT] therefore proposes a\r\nreading agreeable to truth. _Leniter gibbus in priorem et posteriorem\r\net interiorem, cavus in exteriorem_; _i. e._ gently convex in its fore\r\nand posterior, and internal part; concave externally.\r\n\r\n  [JT] Ep. vii. p. 216.\r\n\r\n9. _The two bones of the fore arm at first, &c._) The reading in\r\nLinden and Almeloveen is _primo vero duo radii et brachii ossa, &c._\r\nwhich at once appears to be wrong, because Celsus had said before, _quæ\r\nres sedem brachio præstat, quod constat ex duobus ossibus_, to which\r\ntwo he immediately gives the names of Radius and Cubitus, so that it\r\nwould be sufficient, as Morgagni observes, to have wrote _duo brachii\r\nossa_, or if they must be named _duo radii et cubiti ossa_ according to\r\nthe first of which I have translated. The other editions have _primo\r\nvero duobus radiis brachii ossa_. See Morgagni, Ep. i. p. 28.\r\n\r\n10. _Properly enough, &c._) _Sura_ was the Roman name for the calf of\r\nthe leg, whence our author says, that name is properly enough given to\r\nthe fibula.\r\n\r\n11. _The same may be collected._) _Colligi idem potest._ Morgagni[JU]\r\nwould have the old reading restored here, _nigrities colligi quidem\r\npotest_. _A blackness may be discovered_, &c. because these words in\r\nthe next chapter, _sive autem nigrities quam terebra detexit, &c._ make\r\nit plain the terebra was only used in sounding the blackness.\r\n\r\n  [JU] Ep. vi. p. 159.\r\n\r\n12. _But if the blackness goes thorough._) Sin autem nigrities, and\r\nthen there follows _est aut si caries_, which appears a manifest error\r\nby reason of what follows. With Constantine and Ronsseus, I therefore\r\njudge these words should be expunged, and have taken no notice of them\r\nin the translation.\r\n\r\n13. _Is made by the angle of a chisel._) I here take the reading of\r\nthe older editions, _angulo scalpri sinus exiguus fit_. I suppose _sit_\r\nin Linden and the later copies has been a typographical error. See\r\nMorgagni, Ep. vi. p. 162.\r\n\r\n14. _Being raised in the same._) I have here translated agreeably\r\nto the old reading _excitatæ nares_, instead of which, by a palpable\r\nerror, Linden and Almeloveen had _exercitatæ nares_. Morgagni, Ep. i.\r\np. 29.\r\n\r\n15. _The swelled part._) In Almeloveen and Linden it is _tumens\r\nlocus_, instead of which the old reading was better, _tum is locus_,\r\n_then this par_t; because our author had not mentioned any swelling\r\nbefore. Vid. Morgagni, Ep. v. p. 140.\r\n\r\n16. _For if any part is separated from a vertebra, or is any way\r\nbroken._) This is according to the reading of Linden and Almeloveen;\r\nbut several of the older copies have _Si id, quod ex vertebra excedit,\r\naliquo modo fractum est_; that is, _If the part, that stands out from a\r\nvertebra (the spinal process) is any way fractured_. This agrees very\r\nwell with what is said afterwards of the fragments being spinous.\r\n\r\n17. _Which should be rolled about the fracture._ _Quæ circa fracturam\r\nter voluta._) I find no various reading in any of the editions, but\r\nI think I can produce one from our author himself, who is far from a\r\nprofusion of words and repetitions, and thinks this circumstance of\r\nimportance enough to make a rule bcsy itself in the following words;\r\n_Satisque est eam ter hoc quoque modo circuere_. Upon his authority I\r\nhave therefore ventured to omit the first _ter_.\r\n\r\n18. _And if means only are found, &c._) The period in Linden and\r\nAlmeloveen runs thus, _Ac, si nihil aliud quam dolori occurrendum est,\r\nidem, qui fuit, ejus usus est_; that is, ‘And if nothing else is to be\r\ndone but to remove the pain, its use continues the same as before.’ As\r\nit is evident this cannot be our author’s meaning, I have followed in\r\nthe translation the old reading _occursum_ for _occurrendum_.\r\n\r\n19. _Broader than the wound._) I follow here the old reading\r\n_latioribus_ for _laxioribus_ in Linden, of which I could find no\r\nproper sense. In the following words I have also removed the point at\r\n_vulnus potest_ as the ancient editions have it, and the connection\r\nseems to require.\r\n\r\n20. _Must be applied with that part, &c._) This is according to\r\nLinden’s edition.--None of the more ancient seem to give the true\r\nreading of this whole passage taken together, but some of them afford\r\nhints. Instead of _Acutæ ossis prominentis cuspidi_, Pinzi has _Recte\r\nse habendi capiti_; others _Recte se habenti capiti_. Upon the whole I\r\nthink Morgagni’s[JV] reflections upon this passage extremely probable;\r\nour author had before ordered a sharp point of a fragment to be either\r\ncut off or filed down and smoothed: he is now considering how the\r\nfragment itself is to be replaced. If we read it thus, the sense seems\r\nto be pretty clear: _Vulsella, quali fabri utuntur, injicienda est\r\ncapiti ossis recte habenti, ab ea parte, qua sima est, &c._ that is,\r\n‘A workman’s vulsella should be applied with that part, which turns\r\ninward, to the sound end of the bone, that by its convex part the\r\nprominent bone may be thrust into its place.’\r\n\r\n  [JV] Ep. v. p. 129.\r\n\r\n21. _Unite obliquely._ _Solent tamen interdum adversa inter se ossa\r\nconfervere._) Thus Linden and Almeloveen.--But by what follows it is\r\nplain _adversa_ was never wrote by our author in this place. Many\r\neditions have _transversa_; others _diversa_, which I think is the\r\nonly probable reading, and have taken it in the same sense as Morgagni\r\ndoes.--Ep. vi. p. 164.\r\n\r\n22. _Of the scapula recedes from the humerus._ _Os scapularum ab\r\nhumero recedit._) Morgagni very ingeniously suspects that instead of\r\n_ab humero_ our author wrote _ab jugulo_, because the clavicle is\r\njoined with the scapula, as the tibia with the fibula. Ep. vii. p. 209.\r\nAs it now stands _ab humero_, it would come under the second head;\r\n_Modo articuli suis sedibus excidunt_.\r\n\r\n23. _Yet it is of no use._ _Et ut aliquid decoris eo loco, sic nihil\r\nusus admittitur._) Thus Linden and Almeloveen, and I find no other\r\nvariation in any of the copies, except _sit_ for _sic_, which does not\r\nalter the sense. Our author had said immediately before, ‘That bones\r\nthus separated never come together again,’ which makes it improbable\r\nhe would add, ‘That some comeliness would remain.’ For this reason\r\nI suspect we should read _amittitur_ for _admittitur_, and then the\r\nmeaning will be quite opposite, thus, ‘And though their comeliness is\r\nimpaired, yet their use continues the same as before.’\r\n\r\n24. _Is less firmly held after it is reduced._) In a luxation of the\r\nhumerus from a lax habit Hippocrates advises the use of the actual\r\ncautery, but with great caution, for fear of injuring the blood vessels\r\nor tendons; and when the ulcers are clean and fit for cicatrizing, to\r\nbind the arm close down to the side, and allow no motion, that the\r\ncicatrix may contract the part the more, and strengthen the joint.\r\nHe censures the practice of his predecessors, who cauterized on the\r\nexternal and anterior side, which ever way the bone had been luxated,\r\nand observes that when the humerus is liable to slip into the arm-pit,\r\nthis would rather push it downward, than prevent its luxation. He\r\nproposed therefore the new method of applying the cautery to that part,\r\ntoward which the bone is liable to be protruded. Hippocrat. de Articul.\r\np. 787, 788, and 789.\r\n\r\n25. _That even frequent speaking, by the motion of the mouth, hurts\r\nthe nerves of the temples._) This is according to the reading of Linden\r\nand Almeloveen. The old editions have _adeo ut sermo quoque frequens\r\nmotu oris per nervos lædat_; that is, _that even frequent speaking, by\r\nthe motion of the mouth by the nerves, hurts_. See Morgagni, ep. v. p.\r\n130.\r\n\r\n26. _Tone of the nerves be restored._) I follow here the old editions\r\nin reading _restituta_ for _destituta_.\r\n\r\n27. _That the finger may be restored, &c._) In Linden and Almeloveen,\r\n_ut ita in locum, unde lapsus est digitus, restituatur_. [JW]Morgagni\r\nobserves, that our author had said, there were as many different cases\r\nand the same signs as in the hands; but according to this reading he\r\ntakes no notice of the cure of lateral luxations. Whereas the whole is\r\nset right by restoring the old reading, which was, instead of these\r\nwords, that are quoted from the original, _Atque id, quod in latus\r\nelapsum est, digitis restitui_, _i. e._ “and that which is luxated\r\nlaterally ought to be reduced by the fingers.”\r\n\r\n  [JW] Ep. vi. p. 166.\r\n\r\n28. _Having treated of the humerus._) _Cum de humeris dixerim._\r\nWe might here (says Morgagni) have taken _humeris_ for the superior\r\nextremities as _cruribus_ for the inferior, but the MS. and all my\r\neditions have _cum de his dixerim: de his quoque_ (or as Stephens has\r\nit _de iis quoque_) _quæ in cruribus, &c._ Ep. vi. p. 167.\r\n\r\n29. _By keeping the middle or upper part of the joint in some\r\ncanaliculus._) This whole sentence _Potest tamen conditus articulus\r\nmedius aut summus canaliculo aliquo contineri_, in all the old\r\neditions is placed at the end of the _24th_ chap. and not here.--But\r\n[JX]Morgagni suspects, and as it appears to me, very justly, it should\r\nbe rather referred to luxated fingers than toes, and that Linden\r\nguided by some MS. had transferred it from the _24th_ to the _19th_,\r\nfrom whence it was transposed to this place by the carelessness of the\r\ncopiers, where it stands very improperly.\r\n\r\n  [JX] Ep. vi. p. 169.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE\r\n\r\nINDEX.\r\n\r\nN.B.--n. _refers to the notes_.\r\n\r\n\r\n  A.
