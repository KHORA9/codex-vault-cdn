I was\r\nsoon called away from this employment—ἑκὼν ἀέκοντί γε θυμῷ—to less\r\ncongenial duties in that remote county, wherein long after it was your\r\nGrace’s happy privilege to refresh the spirits of Churchmen and\r\nChurchwomen, by giving them pious work to do, and an example in the doing\r\nof it. What I have since been able to accomplish in the pursuits of sacred\r\ncriticism, although very much less than I once anticipated, has proved, I\r\nwould fain hope, not without its use to those who love Holy Scripture, and\r\nthe studies which help to the understanding of the same.\r\n\r\nAmong the scholars whose sympathy cheered and aided my Biblical labours\r\nfrom time to time, I have had the honour of including your Grace; yet it\r\nwould be at once unseemly and fallacious to assume from that circumstance,\r\nthat the principles of textual criticism which I have consistently\r\nadvocated have approved themselves to your judgement. All that I can look\r\nfor or desire in this respect is that I may seem to you to have stated my\r\ncase fairly and temperately, in earnest controversy with opponents far my\r\nsuperiors in learning and dialectic power, and for whom, in spite of\r\nliterary differences, I entertain deep respect and true regard.\r\n\r\nMy Lord, you have been called by Divine Providence to the first place in\r\nour Communion, and have entered upon your great office attended by the\r\napplauses, the hopeful wishes, and the hearty prayers of the whole Church.\r\nMay it please God to endow you richly with the Christian gifts as well of\r\nwisdom as of courage: for indeed the highest minister of the Church of\r\nEngland, no less than the humblest, will need courage in the coming time,\r\nnow that faith is waxing cold and adversaries are many.\r\n\r\nI am, my Lord Archbishop,\r\n\r\nYour obliged and faithful servant,\r\n\r\nF. H. A. Scrivener.\r\n\r\nHENDON VICARAGE,\r\n\r\n_Whitsuntide_, 1883.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE TO FOURTH EDITION.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt the time of the lamented death of Dr. Scrivener a new edition of his\r\nstandard work was called for, and it was supposed that the great Master of\r\nTextual Criticism had himself made sufficient corrections and additions\r\nfor the purpose in the margin of his copy. When the publishers committed\r\nto me the task of preparation, I was fully aware of the absolute necessity\r\nof going far beyond the materials placed at my disposal, if the book were\r\nto be really useful as being abreast of the very great progress\r\naccomplished in the last ten years. But it was not till I had laboured\r\nwith absolute loyalty for some months that I discovered from my own\r\nobservation, and from the advice of some of the first textual critics, how\r\nmuch alteration must at once be made.\r\n\r\nDr. Scrivener evidently prepared the Third Edition under great\r\ndisadvantage. He had a parish of more than 5,500 inhabitants upon his\r\nhands, with the necessity of making provision for increase in the\r\npopulation. The result was that after adding 125 pages to his book he had\r\nan attack of paralysis, and so it is not surprising that his work was not\r\nwholly conducted upon the high level of his previous publications. The\r\nbook has also laboured under another and greater disadvantage of too\r\nrapid, though unavoidable, growth. The 506 pages of the First Edition have\r\nbeen successively expanded into 626 pages in the Second, 751 in the Third,\r\nand 874 in the Fourth; while the framework originally adopted, consisting\r\nonly of nine chapters, was manifestly inadequate to the mass of material\r\nultimately gathered. It has therefore been found necessary, as the work\r\nproceeded, to do violence, amidst much delicate embarrassment, to feelings\r\nof loyalty to the author forbidding alteration. The chief changes that\r\nhave been made are as follows:—\r\n\r\nThe first intention of keeping the materials within the compass of one\r\nvolume has been abandoned, and it has been divided into two volumes, with\r\nan increase of chapters in each.\r\n\r\nInstead of 2,094 manuscripts, as reckoned in the third edition under the\r\nsix classes, no less than 3,791 have been recorded in this edition, being\r\nan increase of 236 beyond the 3,555 of Dr. Gregory, without counting the\r\nnumerous vacant places which have been filled up.\r\n\r\nMost of the accounts of ancient versions have been rewritten by\r\ndistinguished scholars, who are leaders in their several departments.\r\n\r\nThe early part of Volume I has been enriched from the admirable book on\r\n“Greek and Latin Palaeography,” by Mr. E. Maunde Thompson, who with great\r\nkindness placed the proof-sheets at my disposal before publication.\r\n\r\nChanges have been made in the headlines, the indexes, and in the printing,\r\nand sometimes in the arrangement, which will, I trust, enable the reader\r\nto find his way more easily about the treatise.\r\n\r\nAnd many corrections suggested by eminent scholars have been introduced in\r\ndifferent places all through the work.\r\n\r\nA most pleasing duty now is to tender my best thanks to the Right Reverend\r\nthe Lord Bishop of Salisbury and the Rev. H. J. White, M.A., for the\r\nrewriting of the chapter on Latin Versions by the latter under Dr. John\r\nWordsworth’s supervision, with help from M. Samuel Berger; to the Rev. G.\r\nH. Gwilliam, B.D., Fellow of Hertford College, now editing the Peshitto\r\nfor the University of Oxford, for the improvement of the passages upon the\r\nPeshitto and the Curetonian; the Rev. H. Deane, B.D., for additions to the\r\ntreatment of the Harkleian; and the Rev. Dr. Walker, Principal of St.\r\nJohn’s Hall, Highbury, for the results of a collation of the Peshitto and\r\nCuretonian; to the Rev. A. C. Headlam, M.A., Fellow of All Souls College,\r\nfor a revision of the long chapter upon Egyptian Versions; to F. C.\r\nConybeare, Esq., M.A., late Fellow of University College, for rewriting\r\nthe sections on the Armenian and Georgian Versions; to Professor\r\nMargoliouth, M.A., Fellow of New College, for rewriting the sections on\r\nthe Arabic and Ethiopic Versions; to the Rev. Ll. J. M. Bebb, M.A., Fellow\r\nof Brasenose College, for rewriting the section upon the Slavonic Version;\r\nto Dr. James W. Bright, Assistant-Professor in the Johns Hopkins\r\nUniversity, for rewriting the section on the Anglo-Saxon Version, through\r\nMr. White’s kind offices; to E. Maunde Thompson, Esq., D.C.L., LL.D.,\r\nF.S.A., &c., for kindness already mentioned, and other help, and to G. F.\r\nWarner, Esq., M.A., of the Manuscript Department of the British Museum,\r\nfor correction of some of the notices of cursive MSS. belonging to the\r\nMuseum, and for other assistance; to J. Rendel Harris, Esq., M.A., Fellow\r\nof Clare College and Reader in Palaeology in the University of Cambridge,\r\nfor much help of a varied nature; to Professor Isaac H. Hall, Ph.D., of\r\nNew York City, for sending and placing at my disposal many of his\r\npublications; to the lamented Professor Bensly, for writing me a letter\r\nupon the Syriac Versions; to the Rev. Nicholas Pocock, M.A., of Clifton,\r\nfor some results of a collation of F and G of St. Paul; to Professor\r\nBernard, D.D., Trinity College, Dublin, for a paper of suggestions; to the\r\nRev. Walter Slater, M.A., for preparing Index II in Vol. I; and to several\r\nother kind friends, for assistance of various kinds freely given. The\r\ngenerosity of scholars in communicating out of their stores of learning is\r\na most pleasing feature in the study of the present day. Whatever may be\r\nmy own shortcomings—and I fear that they have been enhanced by limitations\r\nof time and space, and through the effects of ill-health and sorrow—the\r\ncontributions enumerated cannot but render the present edition of Dr.\r\nScrivener’s great work eminently useful to students.\r\n\r\nEdward Miller.\r\n\r\n9, BRADMORE ROAD, OXFORD,\r\n\r\n_January 17, 1894_.\r\n\r\n[Transcriber’s Note: This book contains much Greek text, which will not be\r\nwell-rendered in plain text versions of this E-book.

(22) Cod. Nanianus, Evan. U, retraced after Tregelles. Burgon\r\n    (_Guardian_, Oct. 29, 1873) considers this facsimile unworthy of\r\n    the original writing, which is “even, precise, and beautiful.”\r\n    Mark v. 18: Βάντοσ αυτου | ἐισ τὸ πλοῖο | παρεκάλει ἀυ|τὸν ὁ\r\n    δαιμο|νισθεισ ἵνα. The Ammonian section (μη = 48) is in the margin\r\n    with the Eusebian canon (Β, in error for Η) underneath. The ν on\r\n    the other side is by a much later hand. _See_ p. 149.\r\n\r\n    3.

When God was pleased to make known to man His purpose of redeeming us\r\nthrough the death of His Son, He employed for this end the general laws,\r\nand worked according to the ordinary course of His Providential\r\ngovernment, so far as they were available for the furtherance of His\r\nmerciful design. A revelation from heaven, in its very notion, implies\r\nsupernatural interposition; yet neither in the first promulgation nor in\r\nthe subsequent propagation of Christ’s religion, can we mark any _waste_\r\nof miracles. So far as they were needed for the assurance of honest\r\nseekers after truth, they were freely resorted to: whensoever the\r\nprinciples which move mankind in the affairs of common life were adequate\r\nto the exigences of the case, more unusual and (as we might have thought)\r\nmore powerful means of producing conviction were withheld, as at once\r\nsuperfluous and ineffectual. Those who heard not Moses and the prophets\r\nwould scarcely be persuaded, though one rose from the dead.\r\n\r\n2. As it was with respect to the _evidences_ of our faith, so also with\r\nregard to the volume of Scripture. God willed that His Church should enjoy\r\nthe benefit of His written word, at once as a rule of doctrine and as a\r\nguide unto holy living. For this cause He so enlightened the minds of the\r\nApostles and Evangelists by His Spirit, that they recorded what He had\r\nimprinted on their hearts or brought to their remembrance, without the\r\nrisk of error in anything essential to the verity of the Gospel. But this\r\nmain point once secured, the rest was left, in a great measure, to\r\nthemselves. The style, the tone, the language, perhaps the special\r\noccasion of writing, seem to have depended much on the taste and judgement\r\nof the several penmen. Thus in St. Paul’s Epistles we note the profound\r\nthinker, the great scholar, the consummate orator: St. John pours forth\r\nthe simple utterings of his gentle, untutored, affectionate soul: in St.\r\nPeter’s speeches and letters may be traced the impetuous earnestness of\r\nhis noble yet not faultless character. Their individual tempers and\r\nfaculties and intellectual habits are clearly discernible, even while they\r\nare speaking to us in the power and by the inspiration of the Holy Ghost.\r\n\r\n3. Now this self-same parsimony in the employment of miracles which we\r\nobserve with reference to Christian evidences and to the inspiration of\r\nScripture, we might look for beforehand, from the analogy of divine\r\nthings, when we proceed to consider the methods by which Scripture has\r\nbeen preserved and handed down to us. God _might_, if He would, have\r\nstamped His revealed will visibly on the heavens, that all should read it\r\nthere: He _might_ have so completely filled the minds of His servants the\r\nProphets and Evangelists, that they should have become mere passive\r\ninstruments in the promulgation of His counsel, and the writings they have\r\ndelivered to us have borne no traces whatever of their individual\r\ncharacters: but for certain causes which we can perceive, and doubtless\r\nfor others beyond the reach of our capacities, He has chosen to do neither\r\nthe one nor the other. And so again with the subject we propose to discuss\r\nin the present work, namely, the relation our existing text of the New\r\nTestament bears to that which originally came from the hands of the sacred\r\npenmen. Their autographs _might_ have been preserved in the Church as the\r\nperfect standards by which all accidental variations of the numberless\r\ncopies scattered throughout the world should be corrected to the end of\r\ntime: but we know that these autographs perished utterly in the very\r\ninfancy of Christian history. Or if it be too much to expect that the\r\nautographs of the inspired writers should escape the fate which has\r\novertaken that of every other known relique of ancient literature, God\r\n_might_ have so guided the hand or fixed the devout attention both of\r\ncopyists during the long space of fourteen hundred years before the\r\ninvention of printing, and of compositors and printers of the Bible for\r\nthe last four centuries, that no jot or tittle should have been changed of\r\nall that was written therein. Such a course of Providential arrangement we\r\nmust confess to be quite possible, but it could have been brought about\r\nand maintained by nothing short of a continuous, unceasing miracle;—by\r\nmaking fallible men (nay, many such in every generation) for one purpose\r\nabsolutely infallible. If the complete identity of all copies of Holy\r\nScripture prove to be a fact, we must of course receive it as such, and\r\nrefer it to its sole Author: yet we may confidently pronounce beforehand,\r\nthat such a fact could not have been reasonably anticipated, and is not at\r\nall agreeable to the general tenour of God’s dealings with us.\r\n\r\n4. No one who has taken the trouble to examine any two editions of the\r\nGreek New Testament needs be told that this supposed complete resemblance\r\nin various copies of the holy books is not founded on fact. Even several\r\nimpressions derived from the same standard edition, and professing to\r\nexhibit a text positively the same, differ from their archetype and from\r\neach other, in errors of the press which no amount of care or diligence\r\nhas yet been able to get rid of. If we extend our researches to the\r\nmanuscript copies of Scripture or of its versions which abound in every\r\ngreat library in Christendom, we see in the very best of them variations\r\nwhich we must at once impute to the fault of the scribe, together with\r\nmany others of a graver and more perplexing nature, regarding which we can\r\nform no probable judgement, without calling to our aid the resources of\r\ncritical learning. The more numerous and venerable the documents within\r\nour reach, the more extensive is the view we obtain of the variations (or\r\nVARIOUS READINGS as they are called) that prevail in manuscripts. If the\r\nnumber of these variations was rightly computed at thirty thousand in\r\nMill’s time, a century and a half ago, they must at present amount to at\r\nleast fourfold that quantity.\r\n\r\n5. As the New Testament far surpasses all other remains of antiquity in\r\nvalue and interest, so are the copies of it yet existing in manuscript and\r\ndating from the fourth century of our era downwards, far more numerous\r\nthan those of the most celebrated writers of Greece or Rome. Such as have\r\nbeen already discovered and set down in catalogues are hardly fewer than\r\nthree thousand six hundred, and more must still linger unknown in the\r\nmonastic libraries of the East. On the other hand, manuscripts of the most\r\nillustrious classic poets and philosophers are far rarer and comparatively\r\nmodern. We have no complete copy of Homer himself prior to the thirteenth\r\ncentury, though some considerable fragments have been recently brought to\r\nlight which may plausibly be assigned to the fifth century; while more\r\nthan one work of high and deserved repute has been preserved to our times\r\nonly in a single copy. Now the experience we gain from a critical\r\nexamination of the few classical manuscripts that survive should make us\r\nthankful for the quality and abundance of those of the New Testament.\r\nThese last present us with a vast and almost inexhaustible supply of\r\nmaterials for tracing the history, and upholding (at least within certain\r\nlimits) the purity of the sacred text: every copy, if used diligently and\r\nwith judgement, will contribute somewhat to these ends. So far is the\r\ncopiousness of our stores from causing doubt or perplexity to the genuine\r\nstudent of Holy Scripture, that it leads him to recognize the more fully\r\nits general integrity in the midst of partial variation. What would the\r\nthoughtful reader of Aeschylus give for the like guidance through the\r\nobscurities which vex his patience, and mar his enjoyment of that sublime\r\npoet?\r\n\r\n6. In regard to modern works, it is fortunate that the art of printing has\r\nwellnigh superseded the use of _verbal_ or (as it has been termed)\r\n_Textual_ criticism. When a book once issues from the press, its author’s\r\nwords are for the most part fixed, beyond all danger of change; graven as\r\nwith an iron pen upon the rock for ever. Yet even in modern times, as in\r\nthe case of Barrow’s posthumous works and Pepys’s Diary and Lord\r\nClarendon’s History of the Rebellion, it has been occasionally found\r\nnecessary to correct or enlarge the early editions, from the original\r\nautographs, where they have been preserved. The text of some of our older\r\nEnglish writers (Beaumont and Fletcher’s plays are a notable instance)\r\nwould doubtless have been much improved by the same process, had it been\r\npossible; but the criticism of Shakespeare’s dramas is perhaps the most\r\ndelicate and difficult problem in the whole history of literature since\r\nthat great genius was so strangely contemptuous of the praise of\r\nposterity, that even of the few plays that were published in his lifetime\r\nthe text seems but a gathering from the scraps of their respective parts\r\nwhich had been negligently copied out for the use of the actors.\r\n\r\n7. The design of the science of TEXTUAL CRITICISM, as applied to the Greek\r\nNew Testament, will now be readily understood. By collecting and comparing\r\nand weighing the variations of the text to which we have access, it aims\r\nat bringing back that text, so far as may be, to the condition in which it\r\nstood in the sacred autographs; at removing all spurious additions, if\r\nsuch be found in our present printed copies; at restoring whatsoever may\r\nhave been lost or corrupted or accidentally changed in the lapse of\r\neighteen hundred years. We need spend no time in proving the value of such\r\na science, if it affords us a fair prospect of appreciable results,\r\nresting on grounds of satisfactory evidence. Those who believe the study\r\nof the Scriptures to be alike their duty and privilege, will surely grudge\r\nno pains when called upon to separate the pure gold of God’s word from the\r\ndross which has mingled with it through the accretions of so many\r\ncenturies. Though the criticism of the sacred volume is inferior to its\r\nright interpretation in point of dignity and practical results, yet it\r\nmust take precedence in order of time: for how can we reasonably proceed\r\nto investigate the sense of holy writ, till we have done our utmost to\r\nascertain its precise language?\r\n\r\n8. The importance of the study of Textual criticism is sometimes freely\r\nadmitted by those who deem its successful cultivation difficult, or its\r\nconclusions precarious; the rather as Biblical scholars of deserved repute\r\nare constantly putting forth their several recensions of the text,\r\ndiffering not a little from each other. Now on this point it is right to\r\nspeak clearly and decidedly. There is certainly nothing in the nature of\r\ncritical science which ought to be thought hard or abstruse, or even\r\nremarkably dry and repulsive. It is conversant with varied, curious, and\r\ninteresting researches, which have given a certain serious pleasure to\r\nmany intelligent minds; it patiently gathers and arranges those facts of\r\n_external_ evidence on which alone it ventures to construct a revised\r\ntext, and applies them according to rules or canons of _internal_\r\nevidence, whether suggested by experience, or resting for their proof on\r\nthe plain dictates of common sense. The more industry is brought to these\r\nstudies, the greater the store of materials accumulated, so much the more\r\nfruitful and trustworthy the results have usually proved; although beyond\r\nquestion the true application even of the simplest principles calls for\r\ndiscretion, keenness of intellect, innate tact ripened by constant use, a\r\nsound and impartial judgement. No man ever attained eminence in this, or\r\nin any other worthy accomplishment, without much labour and some natural\r\naptitude for the pursuit; but the criticism of the Greek Testament is a\r\nfield in whose culture the humblest student may contribute a little that\r\nshall be really serviceable; few branches of theology are able to promise,\r\neven to those who seek but a moderate acquaintance with it, so early and\r\nabundant reward for their pains.\r\n\r\n9. Nor can Textual criticism be reasonably disparaged as tending to\r\nprecarious conclusions, or helping to unsettle the text of Scripture. Even\r\nputting the matter on the lowest ground, critics have not _created_ the\r\nvariations they have discovered in manuscripts or versions. They have only\r\ntaught us how to look ascertained phenomena in the face, and try to\r\naccount for them; they would fain lead us to estimate the relative value\r\nof various readings, to decide upon their respective worth, and thus at\r\nlength to eliminate them. While we confess that much remains to be done in\r\nthis department of Biblical learning, we are yet bound to say that,\r\nchiefly by the exertions of scholars of the last and present generations,\r\nthe debateable ground is gradually becoming narrower, not a few strong\r\ncontroversies have been decided beyond the possibility of reversal, and\r\nwhile new facts are daily coming to light, critics of very opposite\r\nsympathies are learning to agree better as to the right mode of\r\nclassifying and applying them. But even were the progress of the science\r\nless hopeful than we believe it to be, one great truth is admitted on all\r\nhands;—the almost complete freedom of Holy Scripture from the bare\r\nsuspicion of wilful corruption; the absolute identity of the testimony of\r\nevery known copy in respect to doctrine, and spirit, and the main drift of\r\nevery argument and every narrative through the entire volume of\r\nInspiration. On a point of such vital moment I am glad to cite the\r\nwell-known and powerful statement of the great Bentley, at once the\r\nprofoundest and the most daring of English critics: “The real text of the\r\nsacred writers does not now (since the originals have been so long lost)\r\nlie in any MS. or edition, but is dispersed in them all. ’Tis competently\r\nexact indeed in the worst MS. now extant; nor is one article of faith or\r\nmoral precept either perverted or lost in them; choose as awkwardly as you\r\nwill, choose the worst by design, out of the whole lump of readings.” And\r\nagain: “Make your 30,000 [variations] as many more, if numbers of copies\r\ncan ever reach that sum: all the better to a knowing and a serious reader,\r\nwho is thereby more richly furnished to select what he sees genuine. But\r\neven put them into the hands of a knave or a fool, and yet with the most\r\nsinistrous and absurd choice, he shall not extinguish the light of any one\r\nchapter, nor so disguise Christianity, but that every feature of it will\r\nstill be the same(4).” Thus hath God’s Providence kept from harm the\r\ntreasure of His written word, so far as is needful for the quiet assurance\r\nof His church and people.\r\n\r\n10. It is now time for us to afford to the uninitiated reader some general\r\nnotion of the nature and extent of the various readings met with in\r\nmanuscripts and versions of the Greek Testament. We shall try to reduce\r\nthem under a few distinct heads, reserving all formal discussion of their\r\nrespective characters and of the authenticity of the texts we cite for the\r\nnext volume (Chapter XI).\r\n\r\n(1) To begin with variations of the gravest kind. In two, though happily\r\nin only two instances, the genuineness of whole passages of considerable\r\nextent, which are read in our printed copies of the New Testament, has\r\nbeen brought into question. These are the weighty and characteristic\r\nparagraphs Mark xvi. 9-20 and John vii. 53-viii. 11. We shall hereafter\r\ndefend these passages, the first without the slightest misgiving, the\r\nsecond with certain reservations, as entitled to be regarded authentic\r\nportions of the Gospels in which they stand.\r\n\r\n(2) Akin to these omissions are several considerable interpolations,\r\nwhich, though they have never obtained a place in the printed text, nor\r\nbeen approved by any critical editor, are supported by authority too\r\nrespectable to be set aside without some inquiry. One of the longest and\r\nbest attested of these paragraphs has been appended to Matt. xx. 28, and\r\nhas been largely borrowed from other passages in the Gospels (see below,\r\nclass 9). It appears in several forms, slightly varying from each other,\r\nand is represented as follows in a document as old as the fifth century:\r\n\r\n\r\n    “But you, seek ye that from little things ye may become great, and\r\n    not from great things may become little. Whenever ye are invited\r\n    to the house of a supper, be not sitting down in the honoured\r\n    place, lest should come he that is more honoured than thou, and to\r\n    thee the Lord of the supper should say, Come near below, and thou\r\n    be ashamed in the eyes of the guests. But if thou sit down in the\r\n    little place, and he that is less than thee should come, and to\r\n    thee the Lord of the supper shall say, Come near, and come up and\r\n    sit down, thou also shalt have more glory in the eyes of the\r\n    guests(5).”\r\n\r\n\r\nWe subjoin another paragraph, inserted after Luke vi. 4 in only a single\r\ncopy, the celebrated Codex Bezae, now at Cambridge: “On the same day he\r\nbeheld a certain man working on the sabbath, and said unto him, Man,\r\nblessed art thou if thou knowest what thou doest; but if thou knowest not,\r\nthou art cursed and a transgressor of the law.’”\r\n\r\n(3) A shorter passage or mere clause, whether inserted or not in our\r\nprinted books, may have appeared originally in the form of a marginal\r\nnote, and from the margin have crept into the text, through the wrong\r\njudgement or mere oversight of the scribe. Such we have reason to think is\r\nthe history of 1 John v. 7, the verse relating to the Three Heavenly\r\nWitnesses, once so earnestly maintained, but now generally given up as\r\nspurious. Thus too Acts viii. 37 may have been derived from some Church\r\nOrdinal: the last clause of Rom. viii. 1 (μὴ κατὰ σάρκα περιπατοῦσιν, ἀλλὰ\r\nκατὰ πνεῦμα) is perhaps like a gloss on τοῖς ἐν Χριστῷ Ἰησοῦ: εἰκῆ in\r\nMatt. v. 22(6) and ἀναξίως in 1 Cor. xi. 29 might have been inserted to\r\nmodify statements that seemed too strong: τῇ ἀληθείᾳ μὴ πείθεσθαι Gal.\r\niii. 1 is precisely such an addition as would help to round an abrupt\r\nsentence (compare Gal. v. 7). Some critics would account in this way for\r\nthe adoption of the doxology Matt. vi. 13; of the section relating to the\r\nbloody sweat Luke xxii. 43, 44; and of that remarkable verse, John v. 4:\r\nbut we may well hesitate before we assent to their views.\r\n\r\n(4) Or a genuine clause is lost by means of what is technically called\r\nHomoeoteleuton (ὁμοιοτέλευτον), when the clause ends in the same word as\r\nclosed the preceding sentence, and the transcriber’s eye has wandered from\r\nthe one to the other, to the entire omission of the whole passage lying\r\nbetween them. This source of error (though too freely appealed to by Meyer\r\nand some other commentators hardly less eminent than he) is familiar to\r\nall who are engaged in copying writing, and is far more serious than might\r\nbe supposed prior to experience. In 1 John ii. 23 ὁ ὁμολογῶν τὸν υἱὸν καὶ\r\nτὸν πατέρα ἔχει is omitted in many manuscripts, because τὸν πατέρα ἔχει\r\nhad ended the preceding clause: it is not found in our commonly received\r\nGreek text, and even in the Authorized English version is printed in\r\nitalics. The whole verse Luke xvii. 36, were it less slenderly supported,\r\nmight possibly have been early lost through the same cause, since vv. 34,\r\n35, 36 all end in ἀφεθήσεται. A safer example is Luke xviii. 39, which a\r\nfew copies omit for this reason only. Thus perhaps we might defend in\r\nMatt. x. 23 the addition after φεύγετε εἰς τὴν ἄλλην of κἂν ἐν τῇ ἑτέρᾳ\r\nδιώκωσιν ὑμᾶς, φεύγετε εἰς τὴν ἄλλην (ἑτέραν being substituted for the\r\nfirst ἄλλην), the eye having passed from the first φεύγετε εἰς τήν to the\r\nsecond. The same effect is produced, though less frequently, when two or\r\nmore sentences _begin_ with the same words, as in Matt. xxiii. 14, 15, 16\r\n(each of which commences with οὐαὶ ὑμῖν), one of the verses being left out\r\nin some manuscripts.\r\n\r\n(5) Numerous variations occur in the order of words, the sense being\r\nslightly or not at all affected; on which account this species of various\r\nreadings was at first much neglected by collators. Examples abound\r\neverywhere: e.g. τὶ μέρος or μέρος τι Luke xi. 36; ὀνόματι Ἀνανίαν or\r\nἈνανίαν ὀνόματι Acts ix. 12; ψυχρὸς οὔτε ζεστός or ζεστὸς οὔτε ψυχρός\r\nApoc. iii. 16. The order of the sacred names Ἰησοῦς Χριστός is perpetually\r\nchanged, especially in St. Paul’s Epistles.\r\n\r\n(6) Sometimes the scribe has mistaken one word for another, which differs\r\nfrom it only in one or two letters. This happens chiefly in cases when the\r\n_uncial_ or capital letters in which the oldest manuscripts are written\r\nresemble each other, except in some fine stroke which may have decayed\r\nthrough age. Hence in Mark v. 14 we find ΑΝΗΓΓΕΙΛΑΝ or ΑΠΗΓΓΕΙΛΑΝ; in Luke\r\nxvi. 20 ΗΛΚΩΜΕΝΟΣ or ΕΙΛΚΩΜΕΝΟΣ; so we read Δαυίδ or Δαβίδ indifferently,\r\nas, in the later or _cursive_ character, β and υ have nearly the same\r\nshape. Akin to these errors of the eye are such transpositions as ΕΛΑΒΟΝ\r\nfor ΕΒΑΛΟΝ or ΕΒΑΛΛΟΝ, Mark xiv. 65: omissions or insertions of the same\r\nor similar letters, as ΕΜΑΣΣΩΝΤΟ or ΕΜΑΣΩΝΤΟ Apoc. xvi. 10: ΑΓΑΛΛΙΑΣΘΗΝΑΙ\r\nor ΑΓΑΛΛΙΑΘΗΝΑΙ John v. 35: and the dropping or repetition of the same or\r\na similar syllable, as ΕΚΒΑΛΛΟΝΤΑΔΑΙΜΟΝΙΑ or ΕΚΒΑΛΛΟΝΤΑΤΑΔΑΙΜΟΝΙΑ Luke ix.\r\n49; ΟΥΔΕΔΕΔΟΞΑΣΤΑΙ or ΟΥΔΕΔΟΞΑΣΤΑΙ 2 Cor. iii. 10; ΑΠΑΞΕΞΕΔΕΧΕΤΟ or\r\nΑΠΕΞΕΔΕΧΕΤΟ 1 Pet. iii. 20. It is easy to see how the ancient practice of\r\nwriting uncial letters without leaving a space between the words must have\r\nincreased the risk of such variations as the foregoing.\r\n\r\n(7) Another source of error is described by some critics as proceeding _ex\r\nore dictantis_, in consequence of the scribe writing from dictation,\r\nwithout having a copy before him. One is not, however, very willing to\r\nbelieve that manuscripts of the better class were executed on so slovenly\r\nand careless a plan. It seems more simple to account for the _itacisms_(7)\r\nor confusion of certain vowels and diphthongs having nearly the same\r\nsound, which exist more or less in manuscripts of every age, by assuming\r\nthat a vicious pronunciation gradually led to a loose mode of orthography\r\nadapted to it. Certain it is that itacisms are much more plentiful in the\r\noriginal subscriptions and marginal notes of the writers of mediaeval\r\nbooks, than in the text which they copied from older documents. Itacisms\r\nprevailed the most extensively from the eighth to the twelfth century, but\r\nnot by any means during that period exclusively:—indeed, they are found\r\nfrequently in the oldest existing manuscripts. In the most ancient\r\nmanuscripts the principal changes are between ι and ει, αι and ε, though\r\nothers occur: in later times η ι and ει, η οι and υ, even ο and ω, η and\r\nε, are used almost promiscuously. Hence it arises that a very large\r\nportion of the various readings brought together by collators are of this\r\ndescription, and although in the vast majority of instances they serve but\r\nto illustrate the character of the manuscripts which exhibit them, or the\r\nfashion of the age in which they were written, they sometimes affect the\r\ngrammatical form (e.g. ἔγειρε or ἔγειραι Mark iii. 3; Acts iii. 6;\r\n_passim_: ἴδετε or εἴδετε Phil. i. 30), or the construction (e.g. ἰάσωμαι\r\nor ἰάσομαι Matt. xiii. 15: οὐ μὴ τιμήσῃ or οὐ μὴ τιμήσει Matt. xv. 5: ἵνα\r\nκαυθήσωμαι or ἵνα καυθήσομαι 1 Cor. xiii. 3, compare 1 Pet. iii. 1), or\r\neven the sense (e.g. ἑταίροις or ἑτέροις Matt. xi. 16: μετὰ διωγμῶν or, as\r\nin a few copies, μετὰ διωγμόν Mark x. 30: καυχᾶσθαι δὴ οὐ συμφέρει or\r\nκαυχᾶσθαι δεῖ; οὐ συμφέρει 2 Cor. xii. 1: ὅτι χρηστὸς ὁ Κύριος or ὅτι\r\nχριστὸς ὁ Κύριος 1 Pet. ii. 3). To this cause we may refer the perpetual\r\ninterchange of ἡμεῖς and ὑμεῖς, with their oblique cases, throughout the\r\nwhole Greek Testament: e.g. in the single epistle of 1 Peter, ch. i. 3;\r\n12; ii. 21 _bis_; iii. 18; 21; v. 10. Hence we must pay the less regard to\r\nthe reading ἡμέτερον Luke xvi. 12, though found in two or three of our\r\nchief authorities: in Acts xvii. 28 τῶν καθ᾽ ἡμᾶς, the reading of the\r\ngreat Codex Vaticanus and a few late copies, is plainly absurd. On the\r\nother hand, a few cases occur wherein that which at first sight seems a\r\nmere _itacism_, when once understood, affords an excellent sense, e.g.\r\nκαθαρίζων Mark iii. 19, and may be really the true form.\r\n\r\n(8) Introductory clauses or Proper Names are frequently interpolated at\r\nthe commencement of Church-lessons (περικοπαί), whether from the margin of\r\nordinary manuscripts of the Greek Testament (where they are usually placed\r\nfor the convenience of the reader), or from the Lectionaries or proper\r\nService Books, especially those of the Gospels (Evangelistaria). Thus in\r\nour English Book of Common Prayer the name of Jesus is introduced into the\r\nGospels for the 14th, 16th, 17th, and 18th Sundays after Trinity; and\r\nwhole clauses into those for the 3rd and 4th Sundays after Easter, and the\r\n6th and 24th after Trinity(8). To this cause may be due the prefix εἶπε δὲ\r\nὁ Κύριος Luke vii. 31; καὶ στραφεὶς πρὸς τοὺς μαθητὰς εἶπε Luke x. 22; and\r\nsuch appellations as ἀδελφοί or τέκνον Τιμόθεε (after σὺ δέ in 2 Tim. iv.\r\n5) in some copies of the Epistles. The inserted prefix in Greek\r\nLectionaries is sometimes rather long, as in the lesson for the Liturgy on\r\nSept. 14 (John xix. 6-35). Hence the frequent interpolation (e.g. Matt.\r\niv. 18; viii. 5; xiv. 22) or changed position (John i. 44) of Ἰησοῦς. A\r\npeculiarity of style in 1, 2 Thess. is kept out of sight by the addition\r\nof Χριστός in the common text of 1 Thess. ii. 19; iii. 13: 2 Thess. i. 8,\r\n12.\r\n\r\n(9) A more extensive and perplexing species of various readings arises\r\nfrom bringing into the text of one of the three earlier Evangelists\r\nexpressions or whole sentences which of right belong not to him, but to\r\none or both the others(9). This natural tendency to assimilate the several\r\nGospels must have been aggravated by the laudable efforts of Biblical\r\nscholars (beginning with Tatian’s Διὰ τεσσάρων in the second century) to\r\nconstruct a satisfactory Harmony of them all. Some of these variations\r\nalso may possibly have been mere marginal notes in the first instance. As\r\nexamples of this class we will name εἰς μετάνοιαν interpolated from Luke\r\nv. 32 into Mark ii. 17: the prophetic citation Matt. xxvii. 35 ἵνα πληρωθῇ\r\nκ.τ.λ. to the end of the verse, unquestionably borrowed from John xix. 24,\r\nalthough the fourth Gospel seldom lends itself to corruptions of this\r\nkind. Mark xiii. 14 τὸ ῥηθὲν ὑπὸ Δανιὴλ τοῦ προφήτου, is probably taken\r\nfrom Matt. xxiv. 15: Luke v. 38 καὶ ἀμφότεροι συντηροῦνται from Matt. ix.\r\n17 (where ἀμφότεροι is the true reading): the whole verse Mark xv. 28\r\nseems spurious, being received from Luke xxii. 37. Even in the same book\r\nwe observe an anxiety to harmonize two separate narratives of the same\r\nevent, as in Acts ix. 5, 6 compared with xxvi. 14, 15.\r\n\r\n(10) In like manner transcribers sometimes quote passages from the Old\r\nTestament more fully than the writers of the New Testament had judged\r\nnecessary for their purpose. Thus ἐγγίζει μοι ... τῷ στόματι αὐτῶν καί\r\nMatt. xv. 8: ἰάσασθαι τοὺς συντετριμμένους τὴν καρδίαν Luke iv. 18: αὐτοῦ\r\nἀκούσεσθε Acts vii. 37: οὐ ψευδομαρτυρήσεις Rom. xiii. 9; ἤ βολίδι\r\nκατατοξευθήσεται Heb. xii. 20, and (less certainly) καὶ κατέστησας αὐτὸν\r\nἐπὶ τὰ ἔργα τῶν χειρῶν σου Heb. ii. 7, are all open to suspicion as being\r\ngenuine portions of the Old Testament text, but not also of the New. In\r\nActs xiii. 33, the Codex Bezae at Cambridge stands almost alone in adding\r\nPs. ii. 8 to that portion of the previous verse which was unquestionably\r\ncited by St. Paul.\r\n\r\n(11) Synonymous words are often interchanged, and so form various\r\nreadings, the sense undergoing some slight and refined modification, or\r\nelse being quite unaltered. Thus ἔφη should be preferred to εἶπεν Matt.\r\nxxii. 37, where εἶπεν of the common text is supported only by two known\r\nmanuscripts, that at Leicester, and one used by Erasmus. So also ὀμμάτων\r\nis put for ὀφθαλμῶν Matt. ix. 29 by the Codex Bezae. In Matt. xxv. 16 the\r\nevidence is almost evenly balanced between ἐποίησεν and ἐκέρδησεν (cf.\r\nver. 17). Where simple verbs are interchanged with their compounds (e.g.\r\nμετρηθήσεται with ἀντιμετρηθήσεται Matt. vii. 2; ἐτέλεσεν with συνετέλεσεν\r\n_ibid._ ver. 28; καίεται with κατακαίεται xiii. 40), or different tenses\r\nof the same verb (e.g. εἰληφώς with λαβών Acts xiv. 24; ἀνθέστηκε with\r\nἀντέστη 2 Tim. iv. 15), there is usually some _internal_ reason why one\r\nshould be chosen rather than the other, if the _external_ evidence on the\r\nother side does not greatly preponderate. When one of two terms is\r\nemployed in a sense peculiar to the New Testament dialect, the easier\r\nsynonym may be suspected of having originated in a gloss or marginal\r\ninterpretation. Hence _caeteris paribus_ we should adopt δικαιοσύνην\r\nrather than ἐλεημοσύνην in Matt. vi. 1; ἐσκυλμένοι rather than ἐκλελυμένοι\r\nix. 36; ἀθῶον rather than δίκαιον xxvii. 4.\r\n\r\n(12) An irregular, obscure, or incomplete construction will often be\r\n_explained_ or _supplied_ in the margin by words that are subsequently\r\nbrought into the text. Of this character is ἐμέμψαντο Mark vii. 2;\r\nδέξασθαι ἡμᾶς 2 Cor. viii. 4; γράφω xiii. 2; προσλαβοῦ Philem. 12 (compare\r\nver. 17), and perhaps δῆλον 1 Tim. vi. 7. More considerable is the change\r\nin Acts viii. 7, where the true reading πολλοὶ ... φωνῇ μεγάλῃ ἐξήρχοντο,\r\nif translated with grammatical rigour, affords an almost impossible sense.\r\nOr an elegant Greek idiom may be transformed into simpler language, as in\r\nActs xvi. 3 ᾔδεισαν γὰρ πάντες ὅτι Ἕλλην ὁ πατὴρ αὐτοῦ ὑπῆρχεν for ᾔδεισαν\r\nγὰρ ἅπαντες τὸν πατέρα αὐτοῦ ὅτι Ἕλλην ὑπῆρχεν: similarly, τυγχάνοντα is\r\nomitted by many in Luke x. 30; compare also Acts xviii. 26 _fin._; xix. 8,\r\n34 _init._ The classical μέν has often been inserted against the best\r\nevidence: e.g. Acts v. 23: xix. 4, 15; 1 Cor. xii. 20; 2 Cor. iv. 12; Heb.\r\nvi. 16. On the other hand a Hebraism may be softened by transcribers, as\r\nin Matt. xxi. 23, where for ἐλθόντι αὐτῷ many copies prefer the easier\r\nἐλθόντος αὐτοῦ before προσῆλθεν αὐτῷ διδάσκοντι, and in Matt. xv. 5; Mark\r\nvii. 12 (to which perhaps we may add Luke v. 35), where καί is dropped in\r\nsome copies to facilitate the sense. Hence καὶ οἱ ἄνθρωποι may be upheld\r\nbefore οἱ ποιμένες in Luke ii. 15. This perpetual correction of harsh,\r\nungrammatical, or Oriental constructions characterizes the printed text of\r\nthe Apocalypse and the recent manuscripts on which it is founded (e.g. τὴν\r\nγυναῖκα Ἰεζαβὴλ τὴν λέγουσαν ii. 20, for ἡ λέγουσα).\r\n\r\n(13) Hence too arises the habit of changing ancient dialectic forms into\r\nthose in vogue in the transcriber’s age. The whole subject will be more\r\nfitly discussed at length hereafter (vol. ii. c. x.); we will here merely\r\nnote a few peculiarities of this kind adopted by some recent critics from\r\nthe oldest manuscripts, but which have gradually though not entirely\r\ndisappeared in copies of lower date. Thus in recent critical editions\r\nΚαθαρναούμ, Μαθθαῖος, τέσσερες, ἔνατος are substituted for Καπερναούμ,\r\nΜατθαῖος, τέσσαρες, ἔννατος of the common text; οὕτως (not οὕτω) is used\r\neven before a consonant; ἤλθαμεν, ἤλθατε, ἦλθαν, γενάμενος are preferred\r\nto ἤλθομεν, ἤλθετε, ἦλθον, γενόμενος: ἐκαθερίσθη, συνζητεῖν, λήμψομαι to\r\nἐκαθαρίσθη, συζητεῖν, λήψομαι: and ν ἐφελκυστικόν (as it is called) is\r\nappended to the usual third persons of verbs, even though a consonant\r\nfollow. On the other hand the more Attic περιπεπατήκει ought not to be\r\nconverted into περιεπεπατήκει in Acts xiv. 8.\r\n\r\n(14) Trifling variations in spelling, though very proper to be noted by a\r\nfaithful collator, are obviously of little consequence. Such is the choice\r\nbetween καὶ ἐγώ and κἀγώ, ἐάν and ἄν, εὐθέως and εὐθύς, Μωυσῆς and Μωσῆς,\r\nor even between πράττουσι and πράσσουσι, between εὐδόκησα, εὐκαίρουν and\r\nηὐδόκησα, ηὐκαίρουν. To this head may be referred the question whether\r\nἀλλά(10), γε, δέ, τε, μετά, παρά &c. should have their final vowel elided\r\nor not when the next word begins with a vowel.\r\n\r\n(15) A large portion of our various readings arises from the omission or\r\ninsertion of such words as cause little appreciable difference in the\r\nsense. To this class belong the pronouns αὐτοῦ, αὐτῷ, αὐτῶν, αὐτοῖς, the\r\nparticles οὖν, δέ, τε, and the interchange of οὐδέ and οὔτε, as also of\r\nκαί and δέ at the opening of a sentence.\r\n\r\n(16) Manuscripts greatly fluctuate in adding and rejecting the Greek\r\narticle, and the sense is often seriously influenced by these variations,\r\nthough they seem so minute. In Mark ii. 26 ἐπὶ Ἀβιάθαρ ἀρχιερέως “in the\r\ntime that Abiathar was high priest” would be historically incorrect, while\r\nἐπὶ Ἀβιάθαρ τοῦ ἀρχιερέως “in the days of Abiathar the high priest” is\r\nsuitable enough. The article will often impart vividness and reality to an\r\nexpression, where its presence is not indispensable: e.g. Luke xii. 54 τὴν\r\nνεφέλην (if τήν be authentic, as looks probable) is the peculiar cloud\r\nspoken of in 1 Kings xviii. 44 as portending rain. Bishop Middleton’s\r\nmonograph (“Doctrine of the Greek Article applied to the Criticism and\r\nIllustration of the New Testament”), though apparently little known to\r\ncertain of our most highly esteemed Biblical scholars, even if its\r\nphilological groundwork be thought a little precarious, must always be\r\nregarded as the text-book on this interesting subject, and is a lasting\r\nmonument of intellectual acuteness and exact learning.\r\n\r\n(17) Not a few various readings may be imputed to the peculiarities of the\r\nstyle of writing adopted in the oldest manuscripts. Thus\r\nΠΡΟΣΤΕΤΑΓΜΕΝΟΥΣΚΑΙΡΟΥΣ Acts xvii. 26 may be divided into two words or\r\nthree; ΚΑΙΤΑΠΑΝΤΑ ibid. ver. 25, by a slight change, has degenerated into\r\nκατὰ πάντα. The habitual abridgement of such words as Θεός or Κύριος\r\nsometimes leads to a corruption of the text. Hence possibly comes the\r\ngrave variation ΟΣ for _ΘΣ_ 1 Tim. iii. 16, and the singular reading τῷ\r\nκαιρῷ δουλεύοντες Rom. xii. 11, where the true word Κυρίῳ was first\r\nshortened into _ΚΡΩ_(11), and then read as ΚΡΩ, Κ being employed to\r\nindicate ΚΑΙ in very early times(12). Or a large initial letter, which the\r\nscribe usually reserved for a subsequent review, may have been altogether\r\nneglected: whence we have τι for Οτι before στενή Matt. vii. 14. Or\r\noverscores, placed over a letter (especially at the end of a line and\r\nword) to denote ν, may have been lost sight of; e.g. λίθον μέγα Matt.\r\nxxvii. 60 in several copies, for ΜΕΓΑ [with a line over the final Α]. The\r\nuse of the symbol [symbol composed of Pi and Rho together], which in the\r\nHerculanean rolls and now and then in Codex Sinaiticus stands for προ and\r\nπρος indifferently, may have produced that remarkable confusion of the two\r\nprepositions when compounded with verbs which we notice in Matt. xxvi. 39;\r\nMark xiv. 35; Acts xii. 6; xvii. 5, 26; xx. 5, 13; xxii. 25. It will be\r\nseen hereafter that as the earliest manuscripts have few marks of\r\npunctuation, breathing or accent, these points (often far from\r\nindifferent) must be left in a great measure to an editor’s taste and\r\njudgement.\r\n\r\n(18) Slips of the pen, whereby words are manifestly lost or repeated,\r\nmis-spelt or half-finished, though of no interest to the critic, must yet\r\nbe noted by a faithful collator, as they will occasionally throw light on\r\nthe history of some particular copy in connexion with others, and always\r\nindicate the degree of care or skill employed by the scribe, and\r\nconsequently the weight due to his general testimony.\r\n\r\nThe great mass of various readings we have hitherto attempted to classify\r\n(to our _first_ and _second_ heads we will recur presently) are manifestly\r\ndue to mere inadvertence or human frailty, and certainly cannot be imputed\r\nto any deliberate intention of transcribers to tamper with the text of\r\nScripture. We must give a different account of a few passages (we are glad\r\nthey are only a few) which yet remain to be noticed.\r\n\r\n(19) The copyist may be tempted to forsake his proper function for that of\r\na reviser, or critical corrector. He may simply omit what he does not\r\nunderstand (e.g. δευτεροπρώτῳ Luke vi. 1; τὸ μαρτύριον 1 Tim. ii. 6), or\r\nmay attempt to get over a difficulty by inversions and other changes. Thus\r\nthe μυστήριον spoken of by St. Paul 1 Cor. xv. 51, which rightly stands in\r\nthe received text πάντες μὲν οὐ κοιμηθησόμεθα, πάντες δὲ ἀλλαγησόμεθα, was\r\neasily varied into πάντες κοιμηθησόμεθα, οὐ π. δὲ ἀλ., as if in mere\r\nperplexity. From this source must arise the omission in a few manuscripts\r\nof υἱοῦ Βαραχίου in Matt. xxiii. 35; of Ἱερεμίου in Matt. xxvii. 9; the\r\ninsertion of ἄλλου ἐκ before θυσιαστηρίου in Apoc. xvi. 7; perhaps the\r\nsubstitution of τοῖς προφήταις for Ἡσαΐᾳ τῷ προφήτῃ in Mark i. 2, of οὔπω\r\nἀναβαίνω for οὐκ ἀναβαίνω in John vii. 8, and certainly of τρίτη for ἕκτε\r\nin John xix. 14. The variations between Γεργεσηνῶν and Γαδαρηνῶν Matt.\r\nviii. 28, and between Βηθαβαρᾶ and Βηθανίᾳ John i. 28, have been\r\nattributed, we hope and believe unjustly, to the misplaced conjectures of\r\nOrigen.\r\n\r\nSome would impute such readings as ἔχωμεν for ἔχομεν Rom. v. 1; φορέσμεν\r\nfor φορέσομεν 1 Cor. xv. 49, to a desire on the part of copyists to\r\n_improve_ an assertion into an ethical exhortation, especially in the\r\nApostolical Epistles; but it is at once safer and more simple to regard\r\nthem with Bishop Chr. Wordsworth (N. T. 1 Cor. xv. 49) as instances of\r\n_itacism_: see class (7) above.\r\n\r\n(20) Finally, whatever conclusion we arrive at respecting the true reading\r\nin the following passages, the discrepancy could hardly have arisen except\r\nfrom doctrinal preconceptions. Matt. xix. 17 Τί με λέγεις ἀγαθόν? οὐδεὶς\r\nἀγαθὸς εἰ μὴ εἶς, ὁ Θεός; or Τί με ἐρωτᾷς περὶ τοῦ ἀγαθοῦ? εἶς ἐστὶν ὁ\r\nἀγαθός: John i. 18 ὁ μονογενὴς υἱός or μονογενὴς Θεός: Acts xvi. 7 τὸ\r\nπνεῦμα with or without the addition of Ἰησοῦ: Acts xx. 28 τὴν ἐκκλησίαν\r\nτοῦ Θεοῦ or τὴν ἐκκλησίαν τοῦ Κυρίου: perhaps also Jude ver. 4 δεσπότην\r\nwith or without Θεόν. I do not mention Mark xiii. 32 οὐδὲ ὁ υἱός, as there\r\nis hardly any authority for its rejection now extant; nor Luke ii. 22,\r\nwhere τοῦ καθαρισμοῦ αὐτῆς of the Complutensian Polyglott and most of our\r\ncommon editions is supported by almost no evidence whatever.\r\n\r\n11. It is very possible that some scattered readings cannot be reduced to\r\nany of the above-named classes, but enough has been said to afford the\r\nstudent a general notion of the nature and extent of the subject(13). It\r\nmay be reasonably thought that a portion of these variations, and those\r\namong the most considerable, had their origin in a cause which must have\r\noperated at least as much in ancient as in modern times, the changes\r\ngradually introduced after publication by the authors themselves into the\r\nvarious copies yet within their reach. Such revised copies would circulate\r\nindependently of those issued previously, and now beyond the writer’s\r\ncontrol; and thus becoming the parents of a new family of copies, would\r\noriginate and keep up diversities from the first edition, without any\r\nfault on the part of transcribers(14). It is thus perhaps we may best\r\naccount for the omission or insertion of whole paragraphs or verses in\r\nmanuscripts of a certain class [see above (1), (2), (3)]; or, in cases\r\nwhere the work was in much request, for those minute touches and trifling\r\nimprovements in words, in construction, in tone, or in the mere colouring\r\nof the style [(5), (11), (12)], which few authors can help attempting,\r\nwhen engaged on revising their favourite compositions. Even in the Old\r\nTestament, the song of David in 2 Sam. xxii is evidently an early draft of\r\nthe more finished composition, Ps. xviii. Traces of the writer’s _curae\r\nsecundae_ may possibly be found in John v. 3, 4; vii. 53-viii. 11; xiii.\r\n26; Acts xx. 4, 15; xxiv. 6-8. To this list some critics feel disposed to\r\nadd portions of Luke xxi-xxiv.\r\n\r\n12. The fullest critical edition of the Greek Testament hitherto published\r\ncontains but a comparatively small portion of the whole mass of variations\r\nalready known; as a rule, the editors neglect, and rightly neglect, mere\r\nerrors of transcription. Such things must be recorded for several reasons,\r\nbut neither they, nor real various readings that are slenderly supported,\r\ncan produce any effect in the task of amending or restoring the sacred\r\ntext. Those who wish to see for themselves how far the common printed\r\neditions of what is called the “textus receptus” differ from the judgement\r\nof the most recent critics, may refer if they please to the small Greek\r\nTestament published in the series of “Cambridge Greek and Latin\r\nTexts(15),” which exhibits in a thicker type all words and clauses wherein\r\nRobert Stephen’s edition of 1550 (which is taken as a convenient standard)\r\ndiffers from the other chief modifications of the _textus receptus_ (viz.\r\nBeza’s 1565 and Elzevir’s 1624), as also from the revised texts of\r\nLachmann 1842-50, of Tischendorf 1865-72, of Tregelles 1857-72, of the\r\nRevisers of the English New Testament (1881), and of Westcott and Hort\r\n(1881). The student will thus be enabled to estimate for himself the\r\nlimits within which the text of the Greek Testament may be regarded as\r\nstill open to discussion, and to take a general survey of the questions on\r\nwhich the theologian is bound to form an intelligent opinion.\r\n\r\n13. The work that lies before us naturally divides itself into three\r\ndistinct parts.\r\n\r\nI. A description of the sources from which various readings are derived\r\n(or of their EXTERNAL EVIDENCE), comprising:\r\n\r\n(_a_) Manuscripts of the Greek New Testament or of portions thereof.\r\n\r\n(_b_) Ancient versions of the New Testament in various languages.\r\n\r\n(_c_) Citations from the Greek Testament or its versions made by early\r\necclesiastical writers, especially by the Fathers of the Christian Church.\r\n\r\n(_d_) Early printed or later critical editions of the Greek Testament.\r\n\r\nII. A discussion of the principles on which external evidence should be\r\napplied to the recension of the sacred volume, embracing\r\n\r\n(_a_) The laws of INTERNAL EVIDENCE, and the limits of their legitimate\r\nuse.\r\n\r\n(_b_) The history of the text and of the principal schemes which have been\r\nproposed for restoring it to its primitive state, including recent views\r\nof Comparative Criticism.\r\n\r\n(_c_) Considerations derived from the peculiar character and grammatical\r\nform of the dialect of the Greek Testament.\r\n\r\nIII. The application of the foregoing materials and principles to the\r\ninvestigation of the true reading in the chief passages of the New\r\nTestament, on which authorities are at variance.\r\n\r\nIn this edition, as has already been explained in the preface, it has been\r\nfound necessary to divide the treatise into two volumes, which will\r\ncontain respectively—\r\n\r\nI. First Volume:—Ancient Manuscripts.\r\n\r\nII. Second Volume:—Versions, Citations, Editions, Principles, and Selected\r\nPassages.\r\n\r\nIt will be found desirable to read the following pages in the order\r\nwherein they stand, although the chief part of Chapters VII-XIV of the\r\nfirst volume and some portions elsewhere (indicated by being printed like\r\nthem in smaller type) are obviously intended chiefly for reference, or for\r\nless searching examination.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II. GENERAL CHARACTER OF THE GREEK MANUSCRIPTS OF THE NEW\r\nTESTAMENT.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs the extant Greek manuscripts of the New Testament supply both the most\r\ncopious and the purest sources of Textual Criticism, we propose to present\r\nto the reader some account of their peculiarities in regard to material,\r\nform, style of writing, date and contents, before we enter into details\r\nrespecting individual copies, under the several subdivisions to which it\r\nis usual to refer them.\r\n\r\n1. The subject of the present section has been systematically discussed in\r\nthe “Palaeographia Graeca” (Paris, 1708, folio) of Bernard de Montfaucon\r\n[1655-1741(16)], the most illustrious member of the learned Society of the\r\nBenedictines of St. Maur. This truly great work, although its materials\r\nare rather too exclusively drawn from manuscripts deposited in French\r\nlibraries, and its many illustrative facsimiles are somewhat rudely\r\nengraved, still maintains a high authority on all points relating to Greek\r\nmanuscripts, even after more recent discoveries, especially among the\r\npapyri of Egypt and Herculaneum, have necessarily modified not a few of\r\nits statements. The four splendid volumes of M. J. B. Silvestre’s\r\n“Paléographie Universelle” (Paris, 1839-41, &c. folio) afford us no less\r\nthan 300 plates of the Greek writing of various ages, sumptuously\r\nexecuted; though the accompanying letter-press descriptions, by F. and A.\r\nChampollion Fils, seem in this branch of the subject a little\r\ndisappointing; nor are the valuable notes appended to his translation of\r\ntheir work by Sir Frederick Madden (London, 2 vols. 1850, 8vo)\r\nsufficiently numerous or elaborate to supply the Champollions’ defects.\r\nMuch, however, may also be learnt from the “Herculanensium voluminum quae\r\nsupersunt” (Naples, 10 tom. 1793-1850, fol.); from Mr. Babington’s three\r\nvolumes of papyrus fragments of Hyperides, respectively published in 1850,\r\n1853 and 1858; and especially from the Prolegomena to Tischendorf’s\r\neditions of the Codices Ephraemi (1843), Friderico-Augustanus (1846),\r\nClaromontanus (1852), Sinaiticus (1862), Vaticanus (1867), and those other\r\nlike publications (e.g. Monumenta sacra inedita 1846-1870, and Anecdota\r\nsacra et profana 1855) which have rendered his name perhaps the very\r\nhighest among scholars in this department of sacred literature. What I\r\nhave been able to add from my own observation, has been gathered from the\r\nstudy of Biblical manuscripts now in England. To these sources of\r\ninformation may now be added Professor Wattenbach’s “Anleitung zur\r\ngriechischen Palaeographie” second edition, Leipsic, 1877, Gardthausen’s\r\n“Griechische Palaeographie,” Leipsic, 1879; Dr. C. R. Gregory’s\r\n“Prolegomena” to the eighth edition of Tischendorf, and especially the\r\npublication of “The Palaeographical Society Greek Testament,” Parts I and\r\nII, Leipsic, 1884, 1891, “Facsimiles of Manuscripts and Inscriptions”\r\nedited by E. A. Bond and E. M. Thompson, Parts I-XII, London, 1873-82, and\r\na Manual on “Greek and Latin Palaeography” from the hands of Mr. E. Maunde\r\nThompson, of which the proof-sheets have been most kindly placed by the\r\naccomplished author at the disposal of the editor of this work, and have\r\nfurnished to this chapter many elements of enrichment. It may be added,\r\nthat since manuscripts have been photographed, all other facsimiles have\r\nbeen put in the shade: and in this edition references as a rule will be\r\ngiven only to photographed copies.\r\n\r\n2. The _materials_ on which writing has been impressed at different\r\nperiods and stages of civilization are the following:—Leaves, bark,\r\nespecially of the lime (_liber_), linen, clay and pottery, wall-spaces,\r\nmetals, lead, bronze, wood, waxen and other tablets, papyrus, skins,\r\nparchment and vellum, and from an early date amongst the Chinese, and in\r\nthe West after the capture of Samarcand by the Arabs in A.D. 704, paper\r\nmanufactured from fibrous substances(17). The most ancient manuscripts of\r\nthe New Testament now existing are composed of vellum or parchment\r\n(_membrana_), the term vellum being strictly applied to the delicate skins\r\nof very young calves, and parchment to the integuments of sheep and goats,\r\nthough the terms are as a rule employed convertibly. The word parchment\r\nseems to be a corruption of _charta pergamena_, a name first given to\r\nskins prepared by some improved process for Eumenes, king of Pergamum,\r\nabout B.C. 150. In judging of the date of a manuscript on skins, attention\r\nmust be paid to the quality of the material, the oldest being almost\r\ninvariably written on the thinnest and whitest vellum that could be\r\nprocured; while manuscripts of later ages, being usually composed of\r\nparchment, are thick, discoloured, and coarsely grained. Thus the Codex\r\nSinaiticus of the fourth century is made of the finest skins of antelopes,\r\nthe leaves being so large, that a single animal would furnish only two\r\n(Tischendorf, Cod. Frid.-August. Prolegomena, §. 1). Its contemporary, the\r\nfar-famed Codex Vaticanus, challenges universal admiration for the beauty\r\nof its vellum: every visitor at the British Museum can observe the\r\nexcellence of that of the Codex Alexandrinus of the fifth century: that of\r\nthe Codex Claromontanus of the sixth century is even more remarkable: the\r\nmaterial of those purple-dyed fragments of the Gospels which Tischendorf\r\ndenominates N, also of the sixth century, is so subtle and delicate, that\r\nsome persons have mistaken the leaves preserved in England (Brit. Mus.\r\nCotton, Titus C xv) for Egyptian papyrus. Paper made of cotton(18)\r\n(_charta bombycina_, called also _charta Damascena_ from its place of\r\nmanufacture) may have been fabricated in the ninth(19) or tenth century,\r\nand linen paper (_charta_ proper) as early as 1242 A.D.; but they were\r\nseldom used for Biblical manuscripts sooner than the thirteenth, and had\r\nnot entirely displaced parchment at the era of the invention of printing,\r\nabout A.D. 1450. Lost portions of parchment or vellum manuscripts are\r\noften supplied in paper by some later hand; but the Codex Leicestrensis of\r\nthe fourteenth century is composed of a mixture of inferior vellum and\r\nworse paper, regularly arranged in the proportion of two parchment to\r\nthree paper leaves, recurring alternately throughout the whole volume.\r\nLike it, in the mixture of parchment and paper, are codd. 233 and Brit.\r\nMus. Harl. 3,161—the latter however not being a New Testament MS.\r\n\r\n3. Although parchment was in occasional, if not familiar, use at the\r\nperiod when the New Testament was written (τὰ βιβλία, μάλιστα τὰς\r\nμεμβράνας 2 Tim. iv. 13), yet the more perishable papyrus of Egypt was\r\nchiefly employed for ordinary purposes. This vegetable production had been\r\nused for literary purposes from the earliest times. “Papyrus rolls are\r\nrepresented on the sculptured walls of Egyptian temples.” The oldest roll\r\nnow extant is the papyrus Prisse at Paris, which dates from 2500 B.C., or\r\neven earlier, unless those which have been lately discovered by Mr.\r\nFlinders Petrie reach as far, or even farther, back(20). The ordinary name\r\napplied in Greek to this material was χάρτης (2 John 12), though Herodotus\r\nterms it βύβλος (ii. 100, v. 58), and in Latin _charta_ (2 Esdr. xv. 2;\r\nTobit vii. 14—Old Latin Version). Papyrus was in those days esteemed more\r\nhighly than skins: for Herodotus expressly states that the Ionians had\r\nbeen compelled to have recourse to goats and sheep for lack of byblus or\r\npapyrus; and Eumenes was driven to prepare parchment because the\r\nAlexandrians were too jealous to supply him with the material which he\r\ncoveted(21). Indeed, papyrus was used far beyond the borders of Egypt, and\r\nwas plentiful in Rome under the Empire, being in fact the common material\r\namong the Romans during that period: and as many of the manuscripts of the\r\nNew Testament must have been written upon so perishable a substance in the\r\nearliest centuries since the Christian era, this probably is one of the\r\nreasons why we possess no considerable copies from before the second\r\nquarter of the fourth century. Only a few fragments of the New Testament\r\non papyrus remain. We find a minute, if not a very clear description of\r\nthe mode of preparing the papyrus for the scribe in the works of the elder\r\nPliny (Hist. Nat. xiii. 11, 12). The plant grew in Egypt, also in Syria,\r\nand on the Niger and the Euphrates. Mainly under Christian influence it\r\nwas supplanted by parchment and vellum, which had superior claims to\r\ndurability, and its manufacture ceased altogether on the conquest of Egypt\r\nby the Mohammedans (A.D. 638).\r\n\r\n4. Parchment is said to have been introduced at Rome not long after its\r\nemployment by Attalus. Nevertheless, if it had been in constant and\r\nordinary use under the first Emperors, we can hardly suppose that\r\nspecimens of secular writing would have failed to come down to us. Its\r\nincreased growth and prevalence about synchronize with the rise of\r\nConstantinopolitan influence. It may readily be imagined that vellum\r\n(especially that fine sort by praiseworthy custom required for copies of\r\nHoly Scripture) could never have been otherwise than scarce and dear.\r\nHence arose, at a very early period of the Christian era, the practice and\r\nalmost the necessity of erasing ancient writing from skins, in order to\r\nmake room for works in which the living generation felt more interest,\r\nespecially when clean vellum failed the scribe towards the end of his\r\ntask. This process of destruction, however, was seldom so fully carried\r\nout, but that the strokes of the elder hand might still be traced, more or\r\nless completely, under the more modern writing. Such manuscripts are\r\ncalled _codices rescripti_ or palimpsests (παλίμψηστα(22)), and several of\r\nthe most precious monuments of sacred learning are of this description.\r\nThe Codex Ephraemi at Paris contains large fragments both of the Old and\r\nNew Testament under the later Greek works of St. Ephraem the Syrian: and\r\nthe Codex Nitriensis, more recently disinterred from a monastery in the\r\nEgyptian desert and brought to the British Museum, comprises a portion of\r\nSt. Luke’s Gospel, nearly obliterated, and covered over by a Syriac\r\ntreatise of Severus of Antioch against Grammaticus, comparatively of no\r\nvalue whatever. It will be easily believed that the collating or\r\ntranscribing of palimpsests has cost much toil and patience to those whose\r\nloving zeal has led them to the attempt: and after all the true readings\r\nwill be sometimes (not often) rather uncertain, even though chemical\r\nmixtures (of which “the most harmless is probably hydrosulphuret of\r\nammonia”) have recently been applied with much success to restore the\r\nfaded lines and letters of these venerable records.\r\n\r\n5. We need say but little of a practice which St. Jerome(23) and others\r\nspeak of as prevalent towards the end of the fourth century, that of\r\ndyeing the vellum purple, and of stamping rather than writing the letters\r\nin silver and gold. The Cotton fragment of the Gospels, mentioned above\r\n(p. 23), is one of the few remaining copies of this kind, as are the newly\r\ndiscovered Codex Rossanensis and the Codex Beratinus, and it is not\r\nunlikely that the great Dublin palimpsest of St. Matthew owes its present\r\nwretched discoloration to some such dye. But, as Davidson sensibly\r\nobserves, “the value of a manuscript does not depend on such things”\r\n(Biblical Criticism, vol. ii. p. 264). We care for them only as they serve\r\nto indicate the reverence paid to the Scriptures by men of old. The style,\r\nhowever, of the pictures, illustrations, arabesques and initial ornaments\r\nthat prevail in later copies from the eighth century downwards, whose\r\ncolours and gilding are sometimes as fresh and bright as if laid on but\r\nyesterday(24), will not only interest the student by tending to throw\r\nlight on mediaeval art and habits and modes of thought, but will often fix\r\nthe date of the books which contain them with a precision otherwise quite\r\nbeyond our reach.\r\n\r\n6. The ink found upon ancient manuscripts is of various colours(25). Black\r\nink, the ordinary writing fluid of centuries (μέλαν, _atramentum_, &c.)\r\ndiffers in tint at various periods and in different countries. In early\r\nMSS. it is either pure black or slightly brown; in the Middle Ages it\r\nvaries a good deal according to age and locality. In Italy and Southern\r\nEurope it is generally blacker than in the North, in France and Flanders\r\nit is generally darker than in England; a Spanish MS. of the fourteenth or\r\nfifteenth century may usually be recognized by the peculiar blackness of\r\nthe ink. Deterioration is observable in the course of time. The ink of the\r\nfifteenth century particularly is often of a faded grey colour. Inks of\r\ngreen, yellow, and other colours, are also found, but generally only for\r\nornamental purposes. Red, either in the form of a pigment or fluid ink, is\r\nof very ancient and common use, being seen even in early Egyptian papyri.\r\nGold was also used as a writing fluid at a very early period.\r\nPurple-stained vellum MSS. were usually written upon in gold or silver\r\nletters, and ordinary white vellum MSS. were also written in gold,\r\nparticularly in the ninth and tenth centuries, in the reigns of the\r\nCarlovingian kings. Gold writing _as a practice_ died out in the\r\nthirteenth century: and writing in silver appears to have ceased\r\ncontemporaneously with the disuse of stained vellum. The ancients used the\r\nliquid of cuttle-fish. Pliny mentions soot and gum as the ingredients of\r\nwriting-ink. Other later authors add gall-apples: metallic infusions at an\r\nearly period, and vitriol in the Middle Ages were also employed.\r\n\r\n7. While papyrus remained in common use, the chief instrument employed was\r\na reed (κάλαμος 3 John ver. 13, _canna_), such as are common in the East\r\nat present: a few existing manuscripts (e.g. the Codd. Leicestrensis and\r\nLambeth 1350) appear to have been thus written. Yet the firmness and\r\nregularity of the strokes, which often remain impressed on the vellum or\r\npaper after the ink has utterly gone, seem to prove that in the great\r\nmajority of cases the _stilus_ made of iron, bronze, or other metal, or\r\nivory or bone, sharp at one end to scratch the letters, and furnished with\r\na knob or flat head at the other for purposes of erasure, had not gone\r\nwholly out of use. We must add to our list of Writing materials a bodkin\r\nor needle (_acus_), by means of which and a ruler the blank leaf was\r\ncarefully divided, generally on the outer side of the skin, into columns\r\nand lines, whose regularity much enhances the beauty of our best copies.\r\nThe vestiges of such points and marks may yet be seen deeply indented on\r\nthe surface of nearly all manuscripts, those on one side of each leaf\r\nbeing usually sufficiently visible to guide the scribe when he came to\r\nwrite on the reverse. The quill pen probably came into use with vellum,\r\nfor which it is obviously suited. The first notices of it occur in a story\r\nrespecting Theodoric the Ostrogoth, and in a passage of Isidore’s\r\n“Origines”(26) (vi. 13).\r\n\r\n8. Little need be said respecting the _form_ of manuscripts, which in this\r\nparticular (_codices_) much resemble printed books. A few are in large\r\nfolio; the greater part in small folio or quarto, the prevailing shape\r\nbeing a quarto (_quaternio_ or quire) whose height but little exceeds its\r\nbreadth; some are in octavo, a not inconsiderable number smaller still:\r\nand quires of three sheets or six leaves, and five sheets or ten leaves\r\n(Cod. Vaticanus), are to be met with. In some copies the sheets have marks\r\nin the lower margin of their first or last pages, like the _signatures_ of\r\na modern volume, the folio at intervals of two, the quarto at intervals of\r\nfour leaves, as in the Codex Bezae of the Gospels and Acts (D), and the\r\nCodex Augiensis of St. Paul’s Epistles (F). Not to speak at present of\r\nthose manuscripts which have a Latin translation in a column parallel to\r\nthe Greek, as the Codex Bezae, the Codex Laudianus of the Acts, and the\r\nCodices Claromontanus and Augiensis of St. Paul, many copies of every age\r\nhave two Greek columns on each page; of these the Codex Alexandrinus is\r\nthe oldest: the Codex Vaticanus has three columns on a page, the Codex\r\nSinaiticus four. The unique arrangement(27) of these last two has been\r\nurged as an argument for their higher antiquity, as if they were designed\r\nto imitate _rolled_ books, whose several skins or leaves were fastened\r\ntogether lengthwise, so that their contents always appeared in parallel\r\ncolumns; they were kept in scrolls which were unrolled at one end for\r\nreading, and when read rolled up at the other. This fashion prevails in\r\nthe papyrus fragments yet remaining, and in the most venerated copies of\r\nthe Old Testament preserved in Jewish synagogues.\r\n\r\n9. We now approach a more important question, the _style_ of writing\r\nadopted in manuscripts, and the shapes of the several letters. These\r\nvaried widely in different ages, and form the simplest and surest criteria\r\nfor approximating to the date of the documents themselves. Greek\r\ncharacters are properly divided into “majuscules” and “minuscules,” or by\r\na subdivision of the former, into Capitals, which are generally of a\r\nsquare kind, fitted for inscriptions on stones like Ε; Uncials, or large\r\nletters(28), and a modification of Capitals, with a free introduction of\r\ncurves, and better suited for writing, like Ε; and Cursives, or small\r\nletters, adapted for the running hand. _Uncial_ manuscripts were written\r\nin what have frequently been regarded as capital letters, formed\r\nseparately, having no connexion with each other, and (in the earlier\r\nspecimens) without any space between the words, the marks of punctuation\r\nbeing few: the _cursive_ or running hand comprising letters more easily\r\nand rapidly made, those in the same word being usually joined together,\r\nwith a complete system of punctuation not widely removed from that of\r\nprinted books. Speaking generally, and limiting our statement to Greek\r\nmanuscripts of the New Testament, Uncial letters or the Literary or\r\nBook-hand prevailed from the fourth to the tenth, or (in the case of\r\nliturgical books) as late as the eleventh century; Cursive letters were\r\nemployed as early as the ninth or tenth century, and continued in use\r\nuntil the invention of printing superseded the humble labours of the\r\nscribe. But cursive writing existed before the Christian era: and it seems\r\nimpossible to suppose that so very convenient a form of penmanship could\r\nhave fallen into abeyance in ordinary life, although few documents have\r\ncome down to us to demonstrate the truth of this supposition.\r\n\r\nBesides the broad and palpable distinction between uncial and cursive\r\nletters, persons who have had much experience in the study of manuscripts\r\nare able to distinguish those of either class from one another in respect\r\nof style and character; so that the period at which each was written can\r\nbe determined within certain inconsiderable limits. After the tenth\r\ncentury many manuscripts bear dates, and such become standards to which we\r\ncan refer others resembling them which are undated. But since the earliest\r\ndated Biblical manuscript yet discovered (Cursive Evan. 481, see below\r\nChap. VII) bears the date May 7, A.D. 835, we must resort to other means\r\nfor estimating the age of more venerable, and therefore more important,\r\ncopies. By studying the style and shape of the letters on Greek\r\ninscriptions, Montfaucon was led to conclude that the more simple,\r\nupright, and regular the form of uncial letters; the less flourish or\r\nornament they exhibit; the nearer their breadth is equal to their height;\r\nso much the more ancient they ought to be considered. These results have\r\nbeen signally confirmed by the subsequent discovery of Greek papyri in\r\nEgyptian tombs especially in the third century before the Christian era;\r\nand yet further from numerous fragments of Philodemus, of Epicurus, and\r\nother philosophers, which were buried in the ruins of Herculaneum in A.D.\r\n79 (“Fragmenta Herculanensia,” Walter Scott). The evidence of these\r\npapyri, indeed, is even more weighty than that of inscriptions, inasmuch\r\nas workers in stone, as has been remarked, were often compelled to prefer\r\nstraight lines, as better adapted to the hardness of their material, where\r\nwritings on papyrus or vellum would naturally flow into curves.\r\n\r\n10. While we freely grant that a certain tact, the fruit of study and\r\nminute observation, can alone make us capable of forming a trustworthy\r\nopinion on the age of manuscripts; it is worth while to point out the\r\n_principles_ on which a true judgement must be grounded, and to submit to\r\nthe reader a few leading facts, which his own research may hereafter\r\nenable him to apply and to extend.\r\n\r\nThe first three plates at the beginning of this volume represent the Greek\r\nalphabet, as found in the seven following monuments:\r\n\r\n(1) The celebrated Rosetta stone, discovered near that place during the\r\nFrench occupation of Egypt in 1799, and now in the British Museum. This\r\nmost important inscription, which in the hands of Young and Champollion\r\nhas proved the key to the mysteries of Egyptian hieroglyphics, records\r\nevents of no intrinsic consequence that occurred B.C. 196, in the reign of\r\nPtolemy V Epiphanes. It is written in the three several forms of\r\nhieroglyphics, of the demotic or common characters of the country, and of\r\nGreek Capitals, which last may represent the _lapidary_ style of the\r\nsecond century before our era. The words are undivided, without\r\nbreathings, accents, or marks of punctuation, and the uncial letters\r\n(excepting [symbol like capital Roman I] for _zeta_) approach very nearly\r\nto our modern capital type. In shape they are simple, perhaps a little\r\nrude; rather square than oblong: and as the carver on this hard black\r\nstone was obliged to avoid curve lines whenever he could, the forms of Ε,\r\nΞ and Σ differ considerably from the specimens we shall produce from\r\ndocuments described on soft materials. Plate I. No. (1).\r\n\r\n(2) The Codex Friderico-Augustanus of the fourth century, published in\r\nlithographed facsimile in 1846, contains on forty-three leaves fragments\r\nof the Septuagint version, chiefly from 1 Chronicles and Jeremiah, with\r\nNehemiah and Esther complete, in oblong folio, with four columns on each\r\npage. The plates are so carefully executed that the very form of the\r\nancient letters and the colour of the ink are represented to us by\r\nTischendorf, who discovered it in the East. In 1859 the same indefatigable\r\nscholar brought to Europe the remainder of this manuscript, which seems as\r\nold as the fourth century, anterior (as he thinks) to the Codex Vaticanus\r\nitself, and published it in 1862, in facsimile type cast for the purpose,\r\n4 tom., with twenty pages lithographed or photographed, at the expense of\r\nthe Emperor Alexander II of Russia, to whom the original had been\r\npresented. This book, which Tischendorf calls Codex Sinaiticus, contains,\r\nbesides much more of the Septuagint, _the whole New Testament_ with\r\nBarnabas’ Epistle and a part of Hermas’ Shepherd annexed. As a kind of\r\n_avant-courier_ to his great work he had previously put forth a tract\r\nentitled “Notitia Editionis Codicis Bibliorum Sinaitici Auspiciis\r\nImperatoris Alexandri II susceptae” (Leipsic, 1860). Of this most valuable\r\nmanuscript a complete account will be given in the opening of the fourth\r\nchapter, under the appellation of _Aleph_ (א), assigned to it by\r\nTischendorf, in the exercise of his right as its discoverer.

Plate III.\r\n\r\nThe leading features of these manuscripts will be described in the fourth\r\nand fifth chapters. At present we wish to compare them with each other for\r\nthe purpose of tracing, as closely as we may, the different styles and\r\nfashions of uncial letters which prevailed from the fourth to the tenth or\r\neleventh century of the Christian era. The varying appearance of cursive\r\nmanuscripts cannot so well be seen by exhibiting their alphabets, for\r\nsince each letter is for the most part joined to the others in the same\r\nword, _connected_ passages alone will afford us a correct notion of their\r\ncharacter and general features. For the moment we are considering the\r\nuncials only.\r\n\r\nIf the Rosetta stone, by its necessary avoiding of curve lines, gives only\r\na notion of the manner adopted on stone and not in common writing, it\r\nresembles our earliest uncials at least in one respect, that the letters,\r\nbeing as broad as they are high, are all capable of being included within\r\ncircumscribed squares. Indeed, yet earlier inscriptions are found almost\r\ntotally destitute of curves, even Ο and Θ being represented by simple\r\nsquares, with or without a bisecting horizontal line (see _theta_, p.\r\n35)(29). The Herculanean papyri, however (a specimen of which we have\r\ngiven in Plate iv. No. 10), are much better suited than inscriptions can\r\nbe for comparison with our earliest copies of Scripture(30). Nothing can\r\nwell be conceived more elegant than these simply-formed graceful little\r\nletters (somewhat diminished in size perhaps by the effects of heat)\r\nrunning across the volume, thirty-nine lines in a column, without capitals\r\nor breaks between the words. There are scarcely any stops, no breathings,\r\naccents, or marks of any kind; only that >, < or [right-pointing triangle]\r\nare now and then found at the end of a line, to fill up the space, or to\r\njoin a word or syllable with what follows. A very few abbreviations occur,\r\nsuch as [symbol like Pi with Rho] in the first line of our specimen, taken\r\nfrom Philodemus περὶ κακιῶν (Hercul. Volum. Tom. iii. Col. xx. ll. 6-15),\r\nthe very manuscript to which Tischendorf compared his Cod.\r\nFriderico-Augustanus (Proleg. § 11). The papyri, buried for so many ages\r\nfrom A.D. 79 downwards, may probably be a century older still, since\r\nPhilodemus the Epicurean was the contemporary and almost the friend of\r\nCicero(31). Hence from three to four hundred years must have elapsed\r\nbetwixt the date of the Herculanean rolls and that of our earliest\r\nBiblical manuscripts. Yet the fashion of writing changed but little during\r\nthe interval, far less in every respect than in the four centuries which\r\nnext followed, wherein the plain, firm, upright and square uncials were\r\ngiving place to the compressed, oblong, ornamented, or even sloping forms\r\nwhich predominate from the seventh or eighth century downwards. While\r\nadvising the reader to exercise his skill on facsimiles of _entire\r\npassages_, especially in contrasting the lines from Philodemus (No. 10)\r\nwith those from the oldest uncials of the New Testament (Nos. 11-14; 17;\r\n18; 20; 24); we purpose to examine the several alphabets (Nos. 1-7) letter\r\nby letter, pointing out to the student those variations in shape which\r\npalaeographers have judged the safest criteria of their relative ages.\r\n_Alpha_, _delta_, _theta_, _xi_, _pi_, _omega_, are among the best tests\r\nfor this purpose.\r\n\r\n\r\n    _Alpha_ is not often found in its present familiar shape, except\r\n    in inscriptions, where the cross line is sometimes broken into an\r\n    angle with the vertex downwards ([Symbol]). Even on the Rosetta\r\n    stone the left limb leans against the upper part of the right\r\n    limb, but does not form an angle with its extremity, while the\r\n    cross line, springing not far from the bottom of the left limb,\r\n    _ascends_ to meet the right about half way down. Modifications of\r\n    this form may be seen in the Herculanean rolls, only that the\r\n    cross line more nearly approaches the horizontal, and sometimes is\r\n    almost entirely so. The Cod. Frid.-August.(32) does not vary much\r\n    from this form, but the three generating lines are often somewhat\r\n    curved. In other books, while the right limb is quite straight,\r\n    the left and cross line form a kind of loop or curve, as is very\r\n    observable in the Nitrian fragment R, and often in Codd. Alex.,\r\n    Ephraemi, Bezae, the newly discovered Rossanensis, and in the\r\n    Vatican more frequently still, in all which _alpha_ often\r\n    approximates to the shape of our English _a_. _And this curve may\r\n    be regarded as a proof of antiquity_; indeed Tischendorf (Proleg.\r\n    Cod. Sin. p. xxx, 1863) considers it almost peculiar to the papyri\r\n    and the Coptic character. Cod. N (which is more recent than those\r\n    named above) makes the two lines on the left form a sharp angle,\r\n    as do the Cotton fragment of Genesis (see p. 32, note 1) and Cod.\r\n    Claromontanus, Plate xiv. No. 41, only that the lines which\r\n    contain the angle in this last are very fine. In later times, as\r\n    the letters grew tall and narrow, the modern type of A became more\r\n    marked, as in the first letter of Arundel 547 (No. 16), of about\r\n    the tenth century, though the form and thickness seen in the Cod.\r\n    Claromontanus continued much in vogue to the last. Yet _alpha_\r\n    even in Cod. Claromontanus and Cotton Genesis occasionally passes\r\n    from the angle into the loop, though not so often as in Cod. A and\r\n    its companions. Cod. Borgianus (T), early in the fifth century,\r\n    exaggerated this loop into a large ellipse, if Giorgi’s facsimile\r\n    may be trusted. In Cod. Laudianus E of the Acts and Cureton’s\r\n    palimpsest Homer too the loop is very decided, the Greek and Latin\r\n    _a_ in Laud. (No. 25) being alike. Mark also its form in the\r\n    papyrus scrawl No. 9 (from one of the orations of Hyperides edited\r\n    by Mr. Babington), which _may_ be as old as the Rosetta stone. The\r\n    angular shape adopted in Cod. Z (Nos. 6, 18) is unsightly enough,\r\n    and (I believe) unique.\r\n\r\n    _Beta_ varies less than _Alpha_. Originally it consisted of a tall\r\n    perpendicular line, on the right side of which four straight lines\r\n    are so placed as to form two triangles, whereof the vertical line\r\n    comprises the bases, while a small portion of that vertical line\r\n    entirely separates the triangles ([Symbol]). This ungraceful\r\n    figure was modified very early, even in inscriptions. On the\r\n    Rosetta stone (No. 1) the triangles are rounded off into\r\n    semicircles, and the lower end of the vertical curved. Yet the\r\n    shape in manuscripts is not quite so elegant. The lower curve is\r\n    usually the larger, and the curves rarely touch each other. Such\r\n    are Codd. ANRZ, Rossanensis (sometimes), and the Cotton Genesis.\r\n    In the Herculanean rolls the letter comes near the common cursive\r\n    β; in some others (as Cod. Rossanensis at times) its shape is\r\n    quite like the modern Β. When oblong letters became common, the\r\n    top (e.g. in Cod. Bezae) and bottom extremities of the curve ran\r\n    into straight lines, by way of return into the primitive shape\r\n    (see No. 36, _dated_ A.D. 980). In the very early papyrus fragment\r\n    of Hyperides it looks like the English R standing on a base (No.\r\n    9, l. 4). But this specimen rather belongs to the semi-cursive\r\n    hand of common life, than to that of books.\r\n\r\n    _Gamma_ in its simplest form consists of two lines of equal\r\n    thickness, the shorter so placed upon the longer, which is\r\n    vertical, as to make one right angle with it on the right side.\r\n    Thus we find it in the Rosetta stone, the papyrus of Hyperides,\r\n    the Herculanean rolls, and very often in Cod. A. The next step was\r\n    to make the horizontal line very thin, and to strengthen its\r\n    extremity by a point, or knob, as in Codd. Ephraemi (No. 24), RZ:\r\n    or the point was thus strengthened without thinning the line, e.g.\r\n    Codd. Vatican., Rossanensis, N and most later copies, such as\r\n    Harl. 5598 (No. 7) or its contemporary Parham 18 (No. 36). In Cod.\r\n    Bezae (No. 42) _gamma_ much resembles the Latin r.\r\n\r\n    _Delta_ should be closely scrutinized. Its most ancient shape is\r\n    an equilateral triangle, the sides being all of the same thickness\r\n    ([symbol]). Cod. Claromontanus, though of the sixth century, is in\r\n    this instance as simple as any: the Herculanean rolls, Codd.\r\n    Vatican., Sinait., and the very old copy of the Pentateuch at\r\n    Paris (Colbert) or “Cod. Sarravianus” and Leyden, much resemble\r\n    it, only that sometimes the Herculanean sides are slightly curved,\r\n    and the right descending stroke of Cod. Vatican, is thickened. In\r\n    Cod. A begins a tendency to prolong the base on one or both sides,\r\n    and to strengthen one or both ends by points. We see a little more\r\n    of this in Cod. Rossanensis and in the palimpsest Homer of the\r\n    fifth century, published by Cureton. The habit increases and\r\n    gradually becomes confirmed in Codd. Ephraemi (No. 24), the\r\n    Vatican Dio Cassius of the fifth or sixth century, in Cod. R, and\r\n    particularly in N and E of the Acts (Nos. 4, 14, 25). In the\r\n    oblong later uncials it becomes quite elaborate, e.g. Cod. B of\r\n    the Apocalypse, or Nos. 7, 21, 36. On the Rosetta stone and in the\r\n    Cod. Bezae the right side is produced beyond the triangle, and is\r\n    produced and slightly curved in Hyperides, curved and strongly\r\n    pointed in Cod. Z.\r\n\r\n    _Epsilon_ has its angular form on the Rosetta marble and other\r\n    inscriptions in stone; in the oldest manuscripts it consists as an\r\n    uncial of a semicircle, from whose centre to the right of it a\r\n    horizontal radius is drawn to the concave circumference. Thus it\r\n    appears in the Herculanean rolls (only that here the radius is\r\n    usually broken off before it meets the circle), in Codd.\r\n    Frid-August., Vatican., the two Paris Pentateuchs (Colbert-Leyden\r\n    fifth century, Coislin. sixth) and the Cotton Genesis. In Cod.\r\n    Alex. a slight trace is found of the more recent practice of\r\n    strengthening each of the three extremities with knobs, but only\r\n    the radius at times in Cod. Rossanensis. The custom increases in\r\n    Codd. Ephraemi, Bezae, and still more in Codd. NRZ, wherein the\r\n    curve becomes greater than a semicircle. In Hyperides (and in a\r\n    slighter degree in Cod. Claromon. No. 41) the shape almost\r\n    resembles the Latin _e_. The form of this and the other round\r\n    letters was afterwards much affected in the narrow oblong uncials:\r\n    see Nos, 7, 16, 36.\r\n\r\n    _Zeta_ on the Rosetta stone maintains its old form ([Symbol rather\r\n    like a Roman capital I]), which is indeed but the next letter\r\n    reversed. In manuscripts it receives its usual modern shape (Z),\r\n    the ends being pointed decidedly, slightly, or not at all, much\r\n    after the manner described for _epsilon_. In old copies the lower\r\n    horizontal line is a trifle curved (Cod. R, No. 5), or even both\r\n    the extreme lines (Cod. Z, No. 6, and Cod. Augiensis of St. Paul).\r\n    In such late books as Parham 18 (A.D. 980, facsim. No. 36) _Zeta_\r\n    is so large as to run far below the line, ending in a kind of\r\n    tail.\r\n\r\n    _Eta_ does not depart from its normal shape (Η) except that in\r\n    Cod. Ephraemi (No. 24) and some narrow and late uncials (e.g. Nos.\r\n    7, 36) the cross line is often more than half way up the letter.\r\n    In a few later uncials the cross line passes _outside_ the two\r\n    perpendiculars, as in the Cod. Augiensis, twenty-six times on the\r\n    photographed page of Scrivener’s edition.\r\n\r\n    _Theta_ deserves close attention. In some early inscriptions it is\r\n    found as a square, bisected horizontally ([Symbol]). On the\r\n    Rosetta stone and most others (but only in such monuments) it is a\r\n    circle, with a strong central _point_. On the Herculanean rolls\r\n    the central point is spread into a short horizontal line, yet not\r\n    reaching the circumference (No. 10, l. 8). Thence in our uncials\r\n    from the fourth to the sixth century the line becomes a horizontal\r\n    diameter to a true circle (Codd. Vatican., Sinait., Codd. ANRZ,\r\n    Ephraemi, Claromont., Rossanensis, and Cureton’s Homer). In the\r\n    seventh century the diameter began to pass out of the circle on\r\n    both sides: thence the circle came to be compressed into an\r\n    ellipse (sometimes very narrow), and the ends of the minor axis to\r\n    be ornamented with knobs, as in Cod. B of the Apocalypse (eighth\r\n    century), Cod. Augiensis (ninth century), LX of the Gospels, after\r\n    the manner of the tenth century (Nos. 7, 16, 21, 36, 38).\r\n\r\n    _Iota_ would need no remark but for the custom of placing over it\r\n    an _upsilon_, when they commence a syllable, either a very short\r\n    straight line, or one or two dots. After the papyrus rolls no copy\r\n    is quite without them, from the Codex Alexandrinus, the Cotton\r\n    Genesis and Paris-Leyden Pentateuch, Cod. Z and the Isaiah\r\n    included in it, to the more recent cursives; although in some\r\n    manuscripts they are much rarer than in others. By far the most\r\n    usual practice is to put two points, but Cod. Ephraemi, in its\r\n    _New_ Testament portion, stands nearly alone with the Cotton\r\n    Genesis (ch. xviii. 9) in exhibiting the straight line; Cod.\r\n    Alexandrinus in the Old Testament, but not in the New, frequently\r\n    resembles Codd. Ephraemi and the Cotton Genesis in placing a\r\n    straight line over _iota_, and more rarely over _upsilon_, instead\r\n    of the single or double dots; Cod. Sinaiticus employs two points\r\n    or a straight line (as in Z’s Isaiah) promiscuously over both\r\n    vowels, and in Wake 12, a cursive of the eleventh century, the\r\n    former frequently pass into the latter in writing. Codd. Borgianus\r\n    (T) and Claromont. have but one point; Codd. N and Rossanensis\r\n    have two for _iota_, one for _upsilon_.\r\n\r\n    _Kappa_ deserves notice chiefly because the vertex of the angle\r\n    formed by the two inclined lines very frequently does not meet the\r\n    perpendicular line, but falls short of it a little to the right:\r\n    we observe this in Codd. ANR, Ephraemi, Rossanensis, and later\r\n    books. The copies that have strong points at the end of _epsilon_\r\n    &c. (e.g. Codd. NR and AZ partly) have the same at the extremity\r\n    of the thin or upper limb of _Kappa_. In Cod. D a fine horizontal\r\n    stroke runs a little to the left from the bottom of the vertical\r\n    line. Compare also the initial letter in Cod. M, No. 32.\r\n\r\n    _Lambda_ much resembles _alpha_, but is less complicated. All our\r\n    models (except Harl. 5598, No. 7), from the Rosetta stone\r\n    downwards, have the right limb longer than the left, which thus\r\n    leans against its side, but the length of the projection varies\r\n    even in the same passage (e.g. No. 10). In most copies later than\r\n    the Herculanean rolls and Cod. Sinaiticus the shorter line is much\r\n    the thinner, and the longer slightly curved. In Cod. Z (Nos. 6,\r\n    18) the projection is curved elegantly at the end, as we saw in\r\n    _delta_.\r\n\r\n    _Mu_ varies as much as most letters. Its normal shape, resembling\r\n    the English M, is retained in the Rosetta stone and most\r\n    inscriptions, but at an early period there was a tendency to make\r\n    the letter broader, and not to bring the re-entering or middle\r\n    angle so low as in English (e.g. Codd. Vaticanus and Sinaiticus).\r\n    In Cod. Ephraemi this central angle is sometimes a little rounded:\r\n    in Codd. Alex. and Parham 18 the lines forming the angle do not\r\n    always spring from the top of the vertical lines: in Arund. 547\r\n    (No. 16) they spring almost from their foot, forming a thick\r\n    inelegant loop below the line, the letter being rather narrow:\r\n    Harl. 5598 (No. 7) somewhat resembles this last, only that the\r\n    loop is higher up. In the Herculanean rolls (and to a less extent\r\n    in the Cotton Genesis) the two outer lines cease to be\r\n    perpendicular, and lean outwards until the letter looks much like\r\n    an inverted W (No. 10). In the papyrus Hyperides (No. 9) these\r\n    outer lines are low curves, and the central lines rise in a kind\r\n    of flourish above them. _Mu_ assumes this shape also in Cod. T,\r\n    and at the end of a line even in Codd. Vaticanus and Sinaiticus.\r\n    This form is so much exaggerated in some examples, that by\r\n    discarding the outer curves we obtain the shape seen in Cod. Z\r\n    (Nos. 6, 18) and one or two others (e.g. Paul M in Harl. 5613, No.\r\n    34), almost exactly resembling an inverted pi. So also in the\r\n    Isaiah of Cod. Z, only that the left side and base line were made\r\n    by one stroke of the pen.\r\n\r\n    _Nu_ is easier, the only change (besides the universal transition\r\n    from the square to the oblong in the later uncials) being that in\r\n    a few cases the thin cross line does not pass from the top of the\r\n    left to the bottom of the right vertical line as in English (N),\r\n    but only from about half-way or two-thirds down the left vertical\r\n    in the Cotton Genesis, Codd. A, Rossanensis, Harl. 5598 (No. 7),\r\n    and others; in Codd. אNR Parham 18 it often neither springs from\r\n    the top of one, nor reaches the foot of the other (Nos. 4, 5, 11b,\r\n    12, 36); while in Cod. Claromont. (No. 41) it is here and there\r\n    not far from horizontal. In a few _cursives_ (e.g. 440 Evan. at\r\n    Cambridge, and Tischendorf’s loti or 61 of the Acts), H and N\r\n    almost interchange their shapes: so in Evan. 66 and Wake 34 at the\r\n    end of a line only.\r\n\r\n    _Xi_ in the Rosetta stone and Herculanean rolls consists of three\r\n    parallel straight lines, the middle one being the shortest, as in\r\n    modern printed Greek: but all our Biblical manuscripts exhibit\r\n    modifications of the small printed ξ, such as must be closely\r\n    inspected, but cannot easily be described. In the Cotton Genesis\r\n    this _xi_ is narrow and smaller than its fellows, much like an old\r\n    English [Symbol: yogh] resting on a horizontal base which curves\r\n    downwards: while in late uncials, as B of the Apocalypse, Cod.\r\n    Augiensis (l. 13 Scrivener’s _photographed page_), and especially\r\n    in Parham 18 (No. 36), the letter and its flourished finial are\r\n    continued far below the line. For the rest we must refer to our\r\n    facsimile alphabets, &c. The figures in Cod. Frid.-August. (Nos.\r\n    2, 11a, ll. 3, 8) look particularly awkward, nor does the shape in\r\n    Cod. Rossanensis much differ from these. In Cod. E, the Zurich\r\n    Psalter of the seventh century, and Mr. W. White’s fragment Wd,\r\n    _xi_ is the common Z with a large horizontal line over it,\r\n    strengthened by knobs at each end.\r\n\r\n    _Omicron_ is unchanged, excepting that in the latest uncials (No.\r\n    16, 36) the circle is mostly compressed, like _theta_, into a very\r\n    eccentric ellipse.\r\n\r\n    _Pi_ requires attention. Its original shape was doubtless two\r\n    vertical straight lines joined at top by another horizontal,\r\n    thinner perhaps but not much shorter than they. Thus we meet with\r\n    it on the Rosetta stone, Codd. R, Vatican., Sinaiticus, Ephraemi,\r\n    Claromontanus, Laud. of the Acts, the two Pentateuchs, Cureton’s\r\n    Homer, and sometimes Cod. A (No. 12). The fine horizontal line is,\r\n    however, slightly produced on both sides in such early documents\r\n    as the papyri of Hyperides and Herculaneum, and in the Cotton\r\n    Genesis, as well as in Cod. A occasionally(33). Both extremities\r\n    of this line are fortified by strong points in Codd. N and\r\n    Rossanensis, and mostly in Cod. A, but the left side only in Cod.\r\n    Z, and this in Cod. Bezae occasionally becomes a sort of hooked\r\n    curve. The later oblong _pi_ was usually very plain, with thick\r\n    vertical lines and a very fine horizontal, in Arund. 547 (No. 16)\r\n    not at all produced; in Harl. 5598 (No. 7) slightly produced on\r\n    both sides; in Parham 18 (No. 36) produced only on the right.\r\n\r\n    _Rho_ is otherwise simple, but in all our authorities except\r\n    inscriptions is produced below the line of writing, least perhaps\r\n    in the papyri and Cod. Claromont., considerably in Codd. AX (Nos.\r\n    12, 38), most in Parham 18 (No. 36): Codd. N, Rossanensis, and\r\n    many later copies have the lower extremity boldly _bevelled_. The\r\n    form is [Symbol like sans-serif bold Roman capital P] rather than\r\n    [Symbol like serif Roman capital P] in Codd. אA. In Cod. D a\r\n    horizontal stroke, longer and thicker than in _kappa_, runs to the\r\n    left from the bottom of the vertical line.\r\n\r\n    _Sigma_ retains its angular shape ([Symbol] or Σ) only on\r\n    inscriptions, as the Rosetta, and that long after the square\r\n    shapes of _omicron_ and _theta_ were discarded. The uncial or\r\n    semicircular form, however, arose early, and to this letter must\r\n    be applied all that was said of _epsilon_ as regards terminal\r\n    points (a knob at the lower extremity occurs even in Cod. א, e.g.\r\n    Acts ii. 31), and its cramped shape in later ages.\r\n\r\n    _Tau_ in its oldest form consists of two straight lines of like\r\n    thickness, the horizontal being bisected by the lower and vertical\r\n    one. As early as in Cod. Sinaiticus the horizontal line is made\r\n    thin, and strengthened on the left side _only_ by a point or small\r\n    knob (Nos. 3, 11): thus we find it in Cod. Laud. of the Acts\r\n    sometimes. In Cod. Alex. _both_ ends are slightly pointed, in\r\n    Codd. Ephraemi, Rossanensis, and others much more. In Cod. Bezae\r\n    the horizontal is curved and flourished; in the late uncials the\r\n    vertical is very thick, the horizontal fine, and the ends formed\r\n    into heavy triangles (e.g. No. 16).\r\n\r\n    _Upsilon_ on the Rosetta stone and Herculanean rolls is like our\r\n    Υ, all the strokes being of equal thickness and not running below\r\n    the line: nor do they in Hyperides or in Codd. XZ and Augiensis,\r\n    which have the upper lines neatly curved (Nos. 6, 9, 18, 38). The\r\n    right limb of many of the rest is sometimes, but not always\r\n    curved; the vertical line in Codd. Vatican. and Sinaiticus drops\r\n    slightly below the line; in Codd. A, Ephraemi, Cotton Genesis,\r\n    Cureton’s Homer, Laud. of the Acts and Rossanensis somewhat more;\r\n    in others (as Codd. Bezae NR) considerably. In the subscription to\r\n    St. Matthew’s Gospel, which may be by a somewhat later hand, a\r\n    horizontal line crosses the vertical a little below the curved\r\n    lines in Cod. Rossanensis. In later uncials (Nos. 7, 36) it\r\n    becomes a long or awkward Y, or even degenerates into a long V\r\n    (No. 16); or, in copies written by Latin scribes, into Y reversed.\r\n    We have described under _iota_ the custom of placing dots, &c.\r\n    over _upsilon_. But in Tischendorf’s Leipzig II. (fragments from\r\n    Numbers to Judges of the seventh or eighth century) _upsilon_\r\n    receives two dots, _iota_ only one. Once in Cod. Z (Matt. xxi. 5)\r\n    and oftener in its Isaiah a convex semicircle, like a circumflex,\r\n    stands over _upsilon_.\r\n\r\n    _Phi_ is a remarkable letter. In most copies it is the largest in\r\n    the alphabet, quite disproportionately large in Codd. ZL (Paris\r\n    62) and others, and to some extent in Codd. AR, Ephraemi,\r\n    Rossanensis, and Claromont. The circle (which in the Cotton\r\n    Genesis is _sometimes_ still a lozenge, see above, p. 32, note 1),\r\n    though large and in some copies even too broad (e.g. No. 18), is\r\n    usually in the line of the other letters, the vertical line being\r\n    produced _far_ upwards (Cod. Augiens. and Nos. 16, 41), or\r\n    downwards (No. 10), or both (No. 36). On the Rosetta stone the\r\n    circle is very small and the straight line short.\r\n\r\n    _Chi_ is a simple transverse cross (Χ) and never goes above or\r\n    below the line. The limb that inclines from left to right is in\r\n    the uncial form for the most part thick, the other thin (with\r\n    final points according to the practice stated for _epsilon_), and\r\n    this limb or both (as in Cod. Z) a little curved.\r\n\r\n    _Psi_ is a rare but trying letter. Its oldest form resembled an\r\n    English V with a straight line running up bisecting its interior\r\n    angle. On the Rosetta stone it had already changed into its\r\n    present form (Ψ), the curve being a small semicircle, the vertical\r\n    rising above the other letters and falling a little below the\r\n    line. In the Cotton Genesis _psi_ is rather taller than the rest,\r\n    but the vertical line does not rise above the level of the circle.\r\n    In Codd. ANR and Rossanensis the under line is prolonged: in R the\r\n    two limbs are straight lines making an angle of about 45° with the\r\n    vertical, while oftentimes in Hyperides and Cod. Augiensis\r\n    (Scrivener’s _photograph_, ll. 18, 23) they curve _downwards_; the\r\n    limbs in N and R being strongly (slightly in Rossanensis) pointed\r\n    at the ends, and the bottom of the vertical bevelled as usual. In\r\n    Cod. B of the Apocalypse, in Evan. OWdΞ, and even in Hyperides,\r\n    the limbs (strongly pointed) fall into a straight line, and the\r\n    figure becomes a large cross (No. 7). In Evan. 66 the vertical is\r\n    crossed above the semicircle by a minute horizontal line.\r\n\r\n    _Omega_ took the form Ω, even when _omicron_ and _theta_ were\r\n    square; thus it appears on the Rosetta stone, but in the Hyperides\r\n    and Herculaneum rolls it is a single curve, much like the w of\r\n    English writing, only that the central part is sometimes only a\r\n    low double curve (No. 10, l. 6). In the Cotton Genesis, Codd.\r\n    Vatican., Sinaiticus, Alex., Ephraemi, Bezae, Claromont.,\r\n    Nitriens., Rossanensis, there is little difference in shape,\r\n    though sometimes Cod. Vatican. comes near the Herculanean rolls,\r\n    and Cod. Alex, next to it: elsewhere their strokes (especially\r\n    those in the centre) are fuller and more laboured. Yet in Cod. N\r\n    it is often but a plain semicircle, bisected by a perpendicular\r\n    radius, with the ends of the curve bent inwards (No. 14, l. 2). In\r\n    the late uncials (Nos. 7, 16) it almost degenerates into an\r\n    ungraceful W, while in Cod. Augiensis (_photograph_, l. 18) the\r\n    first limb is occasionally a complete circle.\r\n\r\n\r\nThese details might be indefinitely added to by references to other\r\ncodices and monuments of antiquity, but we have employed most of the\r\nprincipal copies of the Greek Testament, and have indicated to the student\r\nthe chief points to which his attention should be drawn. Three leading\r\nprinciples have perhaps been sufficiently established by the foregoing\r\nexamples:\r\n\r\nFirst, that the uncials used in writing differ from the capitals cut in\r\nstone by the curved shapes which the writing hand naturally adopts(34).\r\n\r\nSecondly, that the upright uncials of square dimensions are more ancient\r\nthan those which are narrow, oblong, or _leaning_(35).\r\n\r\nThirdly, that the simpler and less elaborate the style of writing, the\r\nmore remote is its probable date.\r\n\r\nCopies of a later age occasionally aim at imitating the fashion of an\r\nearlier period, or possibly the style of the older book from which their\r\ntext is drawn. But this anachronism of fashion may be detected, as well by\r\nother circumstances we are soon to mention, as from the air of constraint\r\nwhich pervades the whole manuscript: the rather as the scribe will now and\r\nthen fall into the more familiar manner of his contemporaries; especially\r\nwhen writing those small letters which our Biblical manuscripts of all\r\ndates (even the most venerable) perpetually crowd into the ends of lines,\r\nin order to save space.\r\n\r\n11. We do not intend to dwell much on the cursive handwriting. No books of\r\nthe Greek Scriptures earlier than the ninth century in this style are now\r\nextant(36), though it was prevalent long before in the intercourse of\r\nbusiness or common life. The papyri of Hyperides (e.g. No. 9) and the\r\nHerculanean rolls, in a few places, show that the process had then\r\ncommenced, for the letters of each word are often joined, and their shapes\r\nprove that swiftness of execution was more aimed at than distinctness.\r\nThis is seen even more clearly in a petition to Ptolemy Philometor (B.C.\r\n164) represented in the “Paléographie Universelle” (No. 56). The same\r\ngreat work contains (No. 66) two really cursive charters of the Emperors\r\nMaurice (A.D. 600) and Heraclius (A.D. 616). Other instances of early\r\ncursive writing may be found in two Deeds of Sale, A.D. 616, and 599, a\r\nManumission in 355, an Official Deed in 233, a Deed of Sale in 154, in\r\nAristotle on the Constitution of Athens, about 100, in a Farm Account in\r\n78-79, in a Receipt in A.D. 20, in the Casati contract in B.C. 114, in a\r\nLetter on Egyptian Contracts in 146, a Treasury Circular in 170, in a\r\nSteward’s letter of the third century B.C., in various documents of the\r\nsame century lying in the British Museum, at Paris, Berlin, Leyden, and\r\nelsewhere, of which the oldest, being amongst the papyri discovered by Dr.\r\nFlinders Petrie at Gurob is referred to B.C. 268, and the Leyden papyrus\r\nto 260(37). Yet the earliest books of a later age known to be written in\r\ncursive letters are Cod. 481 (Scholz 461, dated A.D. 835) the Bodleian\r\nEuclid (dated A.D. 888) and the twenty-four dialogues of Plato in the same\r\nLibrary (dated A.D. 895)(38). There is reason to believe, from the\r\ncomparatively unformed character of the writing in them all, that Burney\r\n19 in the British Museum (from which we have extracted the alphabet No. 8,\r\nPlate iii), and the minute, beautiful and important Codex l of the Gospels\r\nat Basle (of which see a facsimile No. 23), are but little later than the\r\nOxford books, and may be referred to the tenth century. Books copied after\r\nthe cursive hand had become regularly formed, in the eleventh, twelfth and\r\nthirteenth centuries, are hard to be distinguished by the mere\r\nhandwriting, though they are often dated, or their age fixed by the\r\nmaterial (see p. 23), or the style of their illuminations. Colbert. 2844,\r\nor 33 of the Gospels (facsim. No. 39), is attributed to the eleventh\r\ncentury, and Burney 21 (No. 15)(39), is dated A.D. 1292, and afford good\r\nexamples of their respective dates. _Beta_ (l. 1 letter 4), _when joined\r\nto other letters_, is barely distinguishable from _upsilon_(40); _nu_ is\r\neven nearer to _mu_; the tall forms of _eta_ and _epsilon_ are very\r\ngraceful, the whole style elegant and, after a little practice, easily\r\nread. Burney 22 (facsimile No. 37) is dated about the same time, A.D.\r\n1319, and the four Biblical lines much resemble Burney 21(41). In the\r\nfourteenth century a careless style came into fashion, of which Cod.\r\nLeicestrensis (No. 40) is an exaggerated instance, and during this century\r\nand the next our manuscripts, though not devoid of a certain beauty of\r\nappearance, are too full of arbitrary and elaborate contractions to be\r\nconveniently read. The formidable list of abbreviations and ligatures\r\nrepresented in Donaldson’s Greek Grammar (p. 20, third edition)(42)\r\noriginated at this period in the perverse ingenuity of the Greek emigrants\r\nin the West of Europe, who subsisted by their skill as copyists; and these\r\npretty puzzles (for such they now are to many a fair classical scholar),\r\nby being introduced into early printed books(43), have largely helped to\r\nwithdraw them from use in modern times.\r\n\r\n12. We have now to describe the practice of Biblical manuscripts as\r\nregards the insertion of ι forming a diphthong with the long vowels _eta_\r\nand _omega_, also with _alpha_ long, whether by being _ascript_, i.e.\r\nwritten by their side, or _subscript_, i.e. written under them. In the\r\nearliest inscriptions and in the papyri of Thebes ι _ascript_ (the iota\r\nnot smaller than other letters) is invariably found. In the petition to\r\nPtolemy Philometor (_above_, p. 41) it occurs four times in the first\r\nline, three times in the third: in the fragments of Hyperides it is\r\nperpetually though not always read, even where (especially with verbs) it\r\nhas no rightful place, e.g. ετωι και αντιβολωι (facsimile No. 9, ll. 3, 4)\r\nfor αἰτῶ καὶ ἀντιβολῶ. A little before the Christian era it began to grow\r\nobsolete, probably from its being lost in pronunciation. In the\r\nHerculanean Philodemus (the possible limits of whose date are from B.C. 50\r\nto A.D. 79) as in Evann. 556, 604 (Matt. ii. 12, 13), it is often dropped,\r\nthough more usually written. In Codd. Vaticanus and Sinaiticus it is\r\nprobably not found, and from this period it almost disappears from\r\nBiblical uncials(44); in Cureton’s Homer, of the fifth or perhaps of the\r\nsixth century, ι _ascript_ is sometimes neglected, but usually inserted;\r\nsometimes also ι is placed _above_ Η or Ω, an arrangement neither neat nor\r\nconvenient. With the cursive character ι _ascript_ came in again, as may\r\nbe seen from the subscriptions in the Bodleian Euclid and Plato (p. 42,\r\nnote 1). The _semicursive_ fragment of St. Paul’s Epistles in red letters\r\n(M of St. Paul, Plate xii No. 34), used for the binding of Harleian 5613,\r\ncontains ι _ascript_ twice, but I have tried in vain to verify Griesbach’s\r\nstatement (Symbol. Crit. ii. p. 166) that it has ι _subscript_ “bis tantum\r\naut ter.” I can find no such instance in these leaves. The cursive\r\nmanuscripts, speaking generally, either entirely omit both forms, or, if\r\nthey give either, far more often neglect than insert them. Cod. 1 of the\r\nGospels exhibits the _ascript_ ι. Of forty-three codices now in England\r\nwhich have been examined with a view to this matter, twelve have no\r\nvestige of either fashion, fifteen represent the _ascript_ use, nine the\r\n_subscript_ exclusively, while the few that remain exhibit both\r\nindifferently(45). The earliest cursive copy ascertained to exhibit ι\r\n_subscript_ is Matthaei’s r (Apoc. 502 [x]), and after that the Cod.\r\nEphesius (Evan. 71), dated A.D. 1160. The _subscript_ ι came much into\r\nvogue during the fifteenth century, and thus was adopted in printed books.\r\n\r\n13. Breathings (_spiritus_) and accents(46) were not applied\r\nsystematically to Greek Texts before the seventh century. But a practice\r\nprevailed in that and the succeeding century of inserting them in older\r\nmanuscripts, where they were absent _primâ manu_. That such was done in\r\nmany instances (e.g. in Codd. Vatican. and Coislin. 202 or H of St. Paul)\r\nappears clearly from the fact that the passages which the scribe who\r\nretouched the old letters for any cause left unaltered, are destitute of\r\nthese marks, though they appear in all other places. Cod. א exhibits\r\nbreathings, apparently by the original scribe, in Tobit vi. 9; Gal. v. 21\r\nonly. The case of Cod. Alexandrinus is less easy. Though the rest of the\r\nbook has neither breathings (except a few here and there) nor accents, the\r\nfirst four lines of _each_ column of the book of Genesis (see facsimile\r\nNo. 12), which are written in red, are fully furnished with them. These\r\nmarks Baber, who edited the Old Testament portion of Cod. A, pronounced to\r\nbe by a second hand (Notae, p. 1); Sir Frederick Madden, a more competent\r\njudge, declares them the work of the original scribe (Madden’s Silvestre,\r\nVol. i. p. 194, note), and after repeated examination we know not how to\r\ndissent from his view(47). So too in the Sarravian Pentateuch of the fifth\r\ncentury we read ΤΟΝΥΝ [with several symbols written over the Υ] (Lev. xi.\r\n7) by the first hand. The Cureton palimpsest of Homer also has them,\r\nthough they are occasionally obliterated, and some few are evidently\r\ninserted by a corrector; the case is nearly so with the Milan Homer edited\r\nby Mai; and the same must be stated of the Vienna Dioscorides (Silvestre,\r\nNo. 62), whose date is fixed by internal evidence to about A.D. 500. In\r\nthe papyrus fragment of the Psalms, now in the British Museum, the accents\r\nare very accurate, and the work of the original scribe. These facts, and\r\nothers like these, may make us hesitate to adopt the notion generally\r\nreceived among scholars on the authority of Montfaucon (Palaeogr. Graec.\r\np. 33), that breathings and accents were not introduced _primâ manu_\r\nbefore the seventh or eighth century; although up to that period, no\r\ndoubt, they were placed very incorrectly, and often omitted altogether.\r\nThe breathings are much the more ancient and important of the two. The\r\n_spiritus lenis_ indeed may be a mere invention of the Alexandrian\r\ngrammarians of the second or third century before Christ, but the\r\n_spiritus asper_ is in fact the substitute for a real letter (H) which\r\nappears on the oldest inscriptions; its original shape being the first\r\nhalf of the H ([symbol like the left half of a Roman capital letter H]),\r\nof which the second half was subsequently adopted for the _lenis_ ([symbol\r\nlike the right half of a Roman capital H]). This form is sometimes found\r\nin manuscripts of about the eleventh century (e.g. Lebanon, B.M. Addit.\r\n11300 or kscr, and usually in Lambeth 1178 or dscr) ed. of 1550, but even\r\nin the Cod. Alexandrinus the comma and inverted comma are several times\r\nsubstituted to represent the _lenis_ and _asper_ respectively (facsimile\r\nNo. 12): and at a later period this last was the ordinary, though not\r\nquite the invariable, mode of expressing the breathings. Aristophanes of\r\nByzantium (keeper of the famous Library at Alexandria under Ptolemy\r\nEuergetes, about B.C. 240), though probably not the inventor of the Greek\r\naccents, was the first to arrange them in a system. Accentuation must have\r\nbeen a welcome aid to those who employed Greek as a learned, though not as\r\ntheir vernacular tongue, and is so convenient and suggestive that no\r\nmodern scholar can afford to dispense with its familiar use: yet not\r\nbeing, like the rough breathing, an essential portion of the language, it\r\nwas but slowly brought into general vogue. It would seem that in\r\nAugustine’s age [354-430] the distinction between the smooth and rough\r\nbreathing in the manuscripts was just such a point as a careful reader\r\nwould mark, a hasty one overlook(48). Hence it is not surprising that\r\nthough these marks are entirely absent both from the Theban and\r\nHerculanean papyri, a few breathings are apparently by the first hand in\r\nCod. Borgianus or T (Tischendorf, N. T. 1859, Proleg. p. cxxxi). One rough\r\nbreathing is just visible in that early palimpsest of St. John’s Gospel,\r\nIb or Nb. Such as appear, together with some accents, in the Coislin\r\nOctateuch of the sixth or seventh century, may not the less be _primâ\r\nmanu_ because many pages are destitute of them; those of Cod.\r\nClaromontanus, which were once deemed original, are now pronounced by its\r\neditor Tischendorf to be a later addition. Cod. N, the purple fragment so\r\noften spoken of already, exhibits _primâ manu_ over certain vowels a kind\r\nof smooth breathing or slight acute accent, sometimes little larger than a\r\npoint, but inserted on no intelligible principle, so far as we can see,\r\nand far oftener omitted entirely. All copies of Scripture which have not\r\nbeen specified, down to the end of the seventh century, are quite\r\ndestitute of breathings and accents. An important manuscript of the eighth\r\nor ninth century, Cod. L or Paris 62 of the Gospels, has them for the most\r\npart, but not always; though often in the wrong place, and at times in\r\nutter defiance of all grammatical rules. Cod. B of the Apocalypse,\r\nhowever, though of the same age, has breathings and accents as constantly\r\nand correctly as most. Codices of the ninth century, with the exception of\r\nthree written in the West of Europe (Codd. Augiensis or Paul F,\r\nSangallensis or Δ of the Gospels, and Boernerianus or Paul G, which will\r\nbe particularly described afterwards), are all accompanied with these\r\nmarks in full, though often set down without any precise rule, so far as\r\nour experience has enabled us to observe. The uncial Evangelistaria (e.g.\r\nArundel 547; Parham 18; Harleian 5598), especially, are much addicted to\r\nprefixing the _spiritus asper_ improperly; chiefly, perhaps, to words\r\nbeginning with H, so that documents of that age are but slender\r\nauthorities on such points. Of the cursives the general tendency is to be\r\nmore and more accurate as regards the accentuation, the later the date:\r\nbut this is only a general rule, as some that are early are as careful,\r\nand certain of the latest as negligent, as can well be imagined. All of\r\nthem are partial to placing accents or breathings over both parts of a\r\nword compounded with a preposition (e.g. ἐπὶσυνάξαι), and on the other\r\nhand often drop them between a preposition and its case (e.g. ἐπάροτρον).\r\n\r\n14. The punctuation in early times was very simple. In the papyri of\r\nHyperides there are no stops at all, in the Herculanean rolls exceeding\r\nfew: Codd. Sinaiticus and Vaticanus (the latter very rarely by the first\r\nhand) have a single point here and there on a level with the top of the\r\nletters, and occasionally a very small break in the continuous uncials,\r\nwith or (as always in Cod. Ib of the sixth century) without the point, to\r\ndenote a pause in the sense. Codd. A N have the same point a little\r\noftener; in Codd. C Wa (Paris 314) Z and the Cotton Genesis the single\r\npoint stands indiscriminately at the head, middle, or foot of the letters,\r\nwhile in E (Basil. A. N. iii. 12) of the Gospels and B of the Apocalypse,\r\nas in Cod. Marchalianus of the Prophets (sixth or seventh century), this\r\nchange in the position of the point indicates a full-stop, half stop, or\r\ncomma respectively. In Cod. L, of the same date as Codd. E and B (Apoc.),\r\nbesides the full point we have the comma (::.) and semicolon (::), with a\r\ncross also for a stop. In Codd. Y Θa (of about the eighth century) the\r\nsingle point has its various powers as in Cod. E, &c., but besides this\r\nare double, treble, and in Cod. Y quadruple, points with different powers.\r\nIn late uncials, especially Evangelistaria, the chief stop is a cross,\r\noften in red (e.g. Arund. 547); while in Harleian 5598 [symbol like three\r\novals] seems to be the note of interrogation(49). When the continuous\r\nwriting came to be broken up into separate words (of which Cod. Augiensis\r\nin the ninth century affords one of the earliest examples) the single\r\npoint was intended to be placed after the last letter of each word, on a\r\nlevel with the middle of the letters. But even in this copy it is often\r\nomitted in parts, and in Codd. ΔG, written on the same plan, more\r\nfrequently still. Our statements refer only to the Greek portions of these\r\ncopies; the Latin semicolon (;) and the note of interrogation (?) occur in\r\ntheir Latin versions. The Greek interrogation (;) first occurs about the\r\nninth century, and (,) used as a stop a little later. The Bodleian Genesis\r\nof this date, or a little earlier, uses (,) also as an interrogative: so\r\nin later times B-C. iii. 5 [xii], and Evan. 556 [xii]. In the earliest\r\ncursives the system of punctuation is much the same as that of printed\r\nbooks: the English colon (:) not being much used, but the upper single\r\npoint in its stead(50). In a few cursives (e.g. Gonville or 59 of the\r\nGospels), this upper point, set in a larger space, stands also for a full\r\nstop: indeed (·) is the only stop found in Tischendorf’s loti or 61 of the\r\nActs (Brit. Mus. Add. 20,003): while (;) and (·) are often confused in 440\r\nof the Gospels (Cantab. Mm. 6. 9). The English comma, placed above a\r\nletter, is used for the apostrophus, which occurs in the very oldest\r\nuncials, especially at the end of proper names, or to separate compounds\r\n(e.g. απ᾽ ορφανισθεντες in Cod. Clarom.), or when the word ends in ξ or ρ\r\n(e.g. σαρξ᾽ in Cod. B, θυγατηρ᾽ in Codd. Sinait. and A, χειρ᾽ in Cod. A,\r\nὡσπερ᾽ in the Dioscorides, A.D. 500), or even to divide syllables (e.g.\r\nσυριγ᾿γας in Cod. Frid.-August., πολ᾿λα, κατεστραμ᾿μενη, αναγ᾿γελι in Cod.\r\nSinaiticus). In Cod. Z it is found only after αλλ and μεθ, but in Z’s\r\nIsaiah it indicates other elisions (e.g. επ). This mark is more rare in\r\nCod. Ephraemi than in some others, but is used more or less by all, and is\r\nfound after εξ, or ουχ, and a few like words, even in the most recent\r\ncursives. In Cod. Bezae and others it assumes the shape of > rather than\r\nthat of a comma.\r\n\r\n15. Abbreviated words are perhaps least met with in Cod. Vatican., but\r\neven it has _θσ_, _κσ_, _ισ_, _χσ_, _πνα_ for θεός, κύριος, ἰησοῦς,\r\nχριστός, πνεῦμα, &c. and their cases. [Transcriber’s Note: In this e-book,\r\nunderlines are used to represent the overlines used in the paper book.]\r\nThe Cotton Genesis has _θου_ ch. i. 27 by a later hand, but θεου ch. xli.\r\n38. Besides these Codd. Sinaiticus, Alex., Ephraemi and the rest supply\r\n_ανοσ_, _ουνοσ_, _πηρ_ (_πρ_ Cod. Sarrav. Num. xii. 14, &c., _πτηρ_ Cod.\r\nRossanensis), _μηρ_, _ιλημ_ or _ιηλμ_ or _ιλμ_ or _ιηό_ (_ιελμ_ Cod.\r\nSarrav.), _ιηϊ_ or _ισλ_ or _ισηλ_, _δαδ_, and some of them _σηρ_ for\r\nσωτήρ, _υσ_ for υἱός, _παρνξς_ [with a theta above the line] for παρθένος\r\n(Bodleian Genesis), _σρσ_ for σταυρός: Cod. L has πνευ, and Cod. Vatican.\r\nin the _Old_ Testament _ανοσ_ and _πρσ_ occasionally, _ἐθν_ and _ιλημ_ or\r\n_ιλμ_ often(51); Evan. 604 has _σηρ_ for σωτήρ, and _ἐθν_ for ἐθνῶν(52).\r\nCod. Bezae always writes at length ανθρωπος, μητηρ, υἱος, σωτηρ, οὐρανος,\r\nδαυειδ, ἰσραηλ, ἱερουσαλημ; but abridges the sacred names into _χρσ_,\r\n_ιησ_(53) &c. and their cases, as very frequently, but by no means\r\ninvariably, do the kindred Codd. Augiens., Sangall., and Boerner. Cod. Z\r\nseldom abridges, and all copies often set υἱος in full. A few dots\r\nsometimes supply the place of the line denoting abbreviation (e.g. θσ\r\n[with dots over the letters] Cotton Genesis, ανοσ [with dots over the\r\nletters] Colbert. Pentateuch). A straight line over the last letter of a\r\nline, sometimes over any vowel, indicates N (or also M in the Latin of\r\nCodd. Bezae and Claromont.) in all the Biblical uncials, but is placed\r\nonly over numerals in the Herculanean rolls: κ [with tilde below and to\r\nthe right], τ [with tilde below and to the right], and less often θ [with\r\ntilde below and to the right] for καί (see p. 16, note 1), -ται, -θαι are\r\nmet with in Cod. Sinaiticus and all later except Cod. Z: [symbol somewhat\r\nlike Arabic number 8] for ου chiefly in Codd. L, Augiensis, B of the\r\nApocalypse, and the more recent uncials. Such _compendia scribendi_ as\r\n[symbol like Pi with Rho] in the Herculanean rolls (above p. 33) occur\r\nmostly at the end of lines: that form, with ΜΥ [with small circle between\r\nthe letters] (No. 11 a, l. 4), and a few more even in the Cod. Sinaiticus;\r\nin Cod. Sarrav. Μ [with small circle over the letter] stands for both μου\r\nand μοι; in Cureton’s Homer we have Πς for πους, Σς for -σας and such\r\nlike. In later books they are more numerous and complicated, particularly\r\nin cursive writing. The terminations [small raised circle] for ος,\r\n[horizontal line] for ν, [symbol like left single quotation mark] or\r\n[symbol like two left quotation marks] for ον, [symbol like right double\r\nquotation mark] for αις, [symbol like tilde] for ων or ω or ως, [symbol\r\nlike raised small sigma] for ης, [symbol like raised small upsilon] for ου\r\nare familiar; besides others, peculiar to one or a few copies, e.g. τγ for\r\nττ in Burney 19, and Burdett-Coutts i. 4, h for αυ, b for ερ, — for α,\r\n[symbol like horizontal line with circle at right edge] for αρ in the\r\nEmmanuel College copy of the Epistles (Paul 30, No. 33), and [symbol like\r\ncolon] for α, [symbol like small raised capital sigma] or [symbol like\r\nraised small sigma] for αν, [symbol like square root symbol] for ας in\r\nParham 17 of the Apocalypse. Other more rare abridgements are [symbol like\r\ntwo raised small sigmas] for εις in Wake 12, [square root sign]\r\n(Burdett-Coutts I. 4) or < or [raised small alpha] for εν, [symbol like\r\ntwo dots] for ι and [symbol like Hebrew letter Tet with two dots over it]\r\nfor εσ (B-C. iii. 37), [symbol like two dots with comma below them] for εσ\r\nand ε for σε and [symbol like tilde over Rho over Tau] for τησ (B-C. ii.\r\n26), [symbol] for ται and [symbol] for ωσ (B-C. iii. 42), [symbol] for ην\r\n(B-C. iii. 10), [symbol] for ισ and ὀ or [symbol] for ουν (B-C. iii. 41),\r\n[symbol] for ιν or ἐστι, [symbol] for αν, [symbol] or [symbol] for οις,\r\n[symbol] for ας, [symbol] or [symbol] for οις, [symbol] for τε or -τες or\r\nτθν or τον, [symbol] for ειν, [symbol] for ους or ως (Gale O. iv. 22). The\r\nmark > is not only met with in the Herculanean rolls, but in the Hyperides\r\n(facsimile 9, l. 6), in Codd. Vaticanus and Sinaiticus, the two\r\nPentateuchs, Codd. Augiensis, Sangall. and Boernerianus, and seems merely\r\ndesigned to fill up vacant space, like the flourishes in a legal\r\ninstrument(54).\r\n\r\n16. Capital letters of a larger size than the rest at the beginning of\r\nclauses, &c. are freely met with in all documents excepting in the oldest\r\npapyri, the Herculanean rolls, Codd. Vaticanus, Sinaiticus, the Colbert\r\nPentateuch, Isaiah in Cod. Z, and one or two fragments besides(55). Their\r\nabsence is a proof of high antiquity. Yet even in Codd. Vaticanus,\r\nSinaiticus, and Sarravianus, which is the other part of the Colbert\r\nPentateuch (in the first most frequently in the earlier portions of the\r\nOld Testament), the initial letter stands a little outside the line of\r\nwriting after a break in the sense, whether the preceding line had been\r\nquite filled up or not. Such breaks occur more regularly in Codex Bezae,\r\nas will appear when we come to describe it(56). Smaller capitals occur in\r\nthe middle of lines in Codd. Bezae and Marchalianus, of the sixth and\r\nseventh centuries respectively. Moreover, all copies of whatever date are\r\napt to crowd small letters into the end of a line to save room, and if\r\nthese small letters preserve the form of the larger, it is reasonable to\r\nconclude that the scribe is writing in a natural hand, not an assumed one,\r\nand the argument for the antiquity of such a document, derived from the\r\nshape of its letters, thus becomes all the stronger. The continuous form\r\nof writing separate words must have prevailed in manuscripts long after it\r\nwas obsolete in common life: Cod. Claromont., whose text is continuous\r\neven in its Latin version, divides the words in the inscriptions and\r\nsubscriptions to the several books.\r\n\r\n17. The stichometry of the sacred books has next to be considered. The\r\nGreeks and Romans measured the contents of their MSS. by lines, not only\r\nin poetry, but also artificially in prose for a standard line of fifteen\r\nor sixteen syllables, called by the earliest writers ἔπος, afterwards\r\nστίχος(57). Not only do Athanasius [d. 373], Gregory Nyssen [d. 396],\r\nEpiphanius [d. 403], and Chrysostom [d. 407] inform us that in their time\r\nthe Book of Psalms was already divided into στίχοι, while Jerome [d. 420?]\r\ntestifies the same for the prophecies of Isaiah; but Origen also [d. 254]\r\nspeaks of the second and third Epistles of St. John as both of them not\r\nexceeding one hundred στίχοι, of St. Paul’s Epistles as consisting of few,\r\nSt. John’s first Epistle as of very few (Euseb. Hist. Eccles. vi. 25,\r\ncited by Tischendorf, Cod. Sinait., Proleg. p. xxi, note 2, 1863). Even\r\nthe apocryphal letter of our Lord to Abgarus is described as ὀλιγοστίχου\r\nμέν, πολυδυνάμου δὲ ἐπιστολῆς (Euseb. H. E. i. 13): while Eustathius of\r\nAntioch in the fourth century reckoned 135 στίχοι between John viii. 59\r\nand x. 41. More general is the use of the word in Ephraem the Syrian [d.\r\n378], Ὅταν δὲ ἀναγινώσκῃς, ἐπιμελῶς καὶ ἐμπόνως ἀναγίνωσκε, ἐν πολλῇ\r\nκαταστάσει διερχόμενος τὸν στίχον (tom. iii. 101). As regards the Psalms,\r\nwe may see their arrangement for ourselves in Codd. Vaticanus and\r\nSinaiticus, wherein, according to the true principles of Hebrew poetry,\r\nthe verses do not correspond in metre or quantity of syllables, but in the\r\nparallelism or relationship subsisting between the several members of the\r\nsame sentence or stanza(58). Such στίχοι were therefore not “space-lines,”\r\nbut “sense-lines.” It seems to have occurred to Euthalius, a deacon of\r\nAlexandria, as it did long afterwards to Bishop Jebb when he wrote his\r\n“Sacred Literature,” that a large portion of the New Testament might be\r\ndivided into στίχοι on the same principles: and that even where that\r\ndistribution should prove but artificial, it would guide the public reader\r\nin the management of his voice, and remove the necessity for an elaborate\r\nsystem of punctuation. Such, therefore, we conceive to be the use and\r\ndesign of stichometry, as applied to the Greek Testament by Euthalius(59),\r\nwhose edition of the Acts and Epistles was published A.D. 490. Who\r\ndistributed the στίχοι of the Gospels (which are in truth better suited\r\nfor such a process than the Epistles) does not appear. Although but few\r\nmanuscripts now exist that are written στοιχηδόν or στιχηρῶς (a plan which\r\nconsumed too much vellum to become general), we read in many copies, added\r\nusually to the subscription at the foot of each of the books of the New\r\nTestament, a calculation of the number of στίχοι it contained, the numbers\r\nbeing sufficiently unlike to show that the arrangement was not the same in\r\nall codices, yet near enough to prove that they were divided on the same\r\nprinciple(60). In the few documents written στιχηρῶς that survive, the\r\nlength of the clauses is very unequal; some (e.g. Cod. Bezae, _see_ the\r\ndescription below and the facsimile, No. 42) containing as much in a line\r\nas might be conveniently read aloud in a breath, others (e.g. Cod. Laud.\r\nof the Acts, Plate x. No. 25) having only one or two words in a line. The\r\nCod. Claromontanus (facsim. No. 41) in this respect lies between those\r\nextremes, and the fourth great example of this class (Cod. Coislin. 202, H\r\nof St. Paul), of the sixth century, has one of its few surviving pages (of\r\nsixteen lines each) arranged _literatim_ as follows (1 Cor. x. 22, &c.):\r\nεσμεν | παντα μοι εξεστι | αλλ ου παντα συμφερει | παντα μοι εξεστιν | αλλ\r\nου παντα οικοδομει | μηδεισ το εαυτου ζη | (_ob necessitatem spatii_)\r\nτειτω | αλλα το του ετερου | παν το εν μακελλω πω | (_ob necessitatem_)\r\nλουμενον | εσθιετε μηδεν ανα | κρινωντες δια την | συνειδησιν | του γαρ κυ\r\nη γη και το πλη | ρωμα αυτης. Other manuscripts written στιχηρῶς are\r\nMatthaei’s V of the eighth century (though with verses like ours more than\r\nwith ordinary στίχοι), Bengel’s Uffenbach 3 of St. John (Evan. 101),\r\nAlter’s Forlos. 29 (36 of the Apocalypse), and, as it would seem, the Cod.\r\nSangallensis Δ. In Cod. Claromontanus there are scarcely any stops (the\r\nmiddle point being chiefly reserved to follow abridgements or numerals),\r\nthe stichometry being of itself an elaborate scheme of punctuation; but\r\nthe longer στίχοι of Cod. Bezae are often divided by a single point.\r\n\r\n18. In using manuscripts of the Greek Testament, we must carefully note\r\nwhether a reading is _primâ manu_ (*) or by some subsequent corrector\r\n(**). It will often happen that these last are utterly valueless, having\r\nbeen inserted even from printed copies by a modern owner (like some\r\nmarginal variations of the Cod. Leicestrensis)(61), and such as these\r\nreally ought not to have been extracted by collators at all; while others\r\nby the second hand are almost as weighty, for age and goodness, as the\r\ntext itself. All these points are explained by critical editors for each\r\ndocument separately; in fact to discriminate the different corrections in\r\nregard to their antiquity and importance is often the most difficult\r\nportion of such editor’s task (e.g. in Codd. Bezae and Claromontanus), and\r\none on which he often feels it hard to satisfy his own judgement.\r\nCorrections by the original scribe, or by a contemporary reviser, where\r\nthey can be satisfactorily distinguished, must be regarded as a portion of\r\nthe testimony of the manuscript itself, inasmuch as every carefully\r\nprepared copy was reviewed and compared (ἀντεβλήθη), if not by the writer\r\nhimself, by a skilful person appointed for the task (ὁ διορθῶν, ὁ\r\nδιορθωτής), whose duty it was to amend manifest errors, sometimes also to\r\ninsert ornamental capitals in places which had been reserved for them; in\r\nlater times (and as some believe at a very early period) to set in stops,\r\nbreathings and accents; in copies destined for ecclesiastical use to\r\narrange the musical notes that were to guide the intonation of the reader.\r\nNotices of this kind of revision are sometimes met with at the end of the\r\nbest manuscripts. Such is the note in Cod. H of St. Paul: εγραψα και\r\nεξεθεμην προσ το εν Καισαρια αντιγραφον τησ διδλιοθηκησ του αγιου\r\nΠαμφιλου, the same library of the Martyr Pamphilus to which the scribe of\r\nthe Cod. Frid.-August. resorted for his model(62); and that in Birch’s\r\nmost valuable Urbino-Vatican. 2 (157 of the Gospels), written for the\r\nEmperor John II (1118-1143), wherein at the end of the first Gospel we\r\nread κατὰ Ματθαῖον ἐγράφη καὶ ἀντεβλήθη ἐκ τῶν ἐν ἱεροσολύμοις παλαιῶν\r\nἀντιγράφων τῶν ἐν ἁγίω ὄρει [Athos] ἀποκειμένων: similar subscriptions are\r\nappended to the other Gospels. See also Evan. Λ. 20, 164, 262, 300, 376;\r\nAct. 15, 83, in the list of manuscripts below.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III. DIVISIONS OF THE TEXT, AND OTHER PARTICULARS.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have next to give some account of ancient divisions of the text, as\r\nfound in manuscripts of the New Testament; and these must be carefully\r\nnoted by the student, since few copies are without one or more of them.\r\n\r\n1. So far as we know at present, the oldest sections still extant are\r\nthose of the Codex Vaticanus. These seem to have been formed for the\r\npurpose of reference, and a new one always commences where there is some\r\nbreak in the sense. Many, however, at least in the Gospels, consist of but\r\none of our modern verses, and they are so unequal in length as to be\r\nrather inconvenient for actual use. In the four Gospels only the marginal\r\nnumerals are in red, St. Matthew containing 170 of these divisions, St.\r\nMark 62, St. Luke 152, St. John 80. In the Acts of the Apostles are two\r\nsets of sections, thirty-six longer and in an older hand, sixty-nine\r\nsmaller and more recent(63). Each of these also begins after a break in\r\nthe sense, but they are quite independent of each other, as a larger\r\nsection will sometimes commence in the middle of a smaller, the latter\r\nbeing in no wise a subdivision of the former. Thus the greater Γ opens\r\nActs ii. 1, in the middle of the lesser β, which extends from Acts i. 15\r\nto ii. 4. The first forty-two of the lesser chapters, down to Acts xv. 40,\r\nare found also with slight variations in the margin of Codex Sinaiticus,\r\nwritten by a very old hand. As in most manuscripts, so in Codex Vaticanus,\r\nthe Catholic Epistles follow the Acts, and in them also and in St. Paul’s\r\nEpistles there are two sets of sections, only that in the Epistles the\r\nolder sections are the more numerous. The Pauline Epistles are reckoned\r\nthroughout as one book in the elder notation, with however this remarkable\r\npeculiarity, that though in the Cod. Vatican. itself the Epistle to the\r\nHebrews stands next after the second to the Thessalonians, _and on the\r\nsame leaf with it_, the sections are arranged as if it stood between the\r\nEpistles to the Galatians and Ephesians. For whereas that to the Galatians\r\nends with § 58, that to the Ephesians begins with § 70, and the numbers\r\nproceed regularly down to § 93, with which the second to the Thessalonians\r\nends. The Epistle to the Hebrews which then follows opens with § 59; the\r\nlast section extant (§ 64) begins at Heb. ix. 11, and the manuscript ends\r\nabruptly at καθα ver. 14. It plainly appears, then, that the sections of\r\nthe Codex Vaticanus must have been copied from some yet older document, in\r\nwhich the Epistle to the Hebrews preceded that to the Ephesians. It will\r\nbe found hereafter (vol. ii) that in the Thebaic version the Epistle to\r\nthe Hebrews preceded that to the Galatians, instead of following it, as\r\nhere. For a list of the more modern divisions in the Epistles, see the\r\nTable given below. The Vatican sections of the Gospels have also been\r\ndiscovered by Tregelles in one other copy, the palimpsest Codex Zacynthius\r\nof St. Luke (Ξ), which he published in 1861.\r\n\r\n2. Hardly less ancient, and indeed ascribed by some to Tatian the\r\nHarmonist, the disciple of Justin Martyr, is the division of the Gospels\r\ninto larger chapters or κεφάλαια _majora_(64). It may be noticed that in\r\nnone of the four Gospels does the first chapter stand at its commencement.\r\nIn St. Matthew chapter A begins at chap. ii. verse 1, and has for its\r\ntitle περὶ τῶν μάγων: in St. Mark at chap. i. ver. 23 περὶ τοῧ\r\nδαιμονιζομένου: in St. Luke at chap. ii. ver. 1 περὶ τῆς ἀπογραφῆς: in St.\r\nJohn at chap. ii. ver. 1 περὶ τοῦ ἐν Κανᾶ γάμου. Mill accounts for this\r\ncircumstance by supposing that in the first copies the titles at the head\r\nof each Gospel were reserved till last for more splendid illumination, and\r\nwere thus eventually forgotten (Proleg. N. T. § 355); Griesbach holds,\r\nthat the general inscriptions of each Gospel, Κατὰ Ματθαῖον, Κατὰ Μάρκον,\r\n&c., were regarded as the special titles of the first chapters also. On\r\neither supposition, however, it would be hard to explain how what was\r\nreally the second chapter came to be _numbered_ as the first; and it is\r\nworth notice that the same arrangement takes place in the κεφάλαια (though\r\nthese are of a later date) of all the other books of the New Testament\r\nexcept the Acts, 2 Corinth., Ephes., 1 Thess., Hebrews, James, 1 and 2\r\nPeter, 1 John, and the Apocalypse: e.g. the first chapter of the Epistle\r\nto the Romans opens ch. i. ver. 18 Πρῶτον μετὰ τὸ προοίμιον, περὶ κρίσεως\r\nτῆς κατὰ ἐθνῶν τῶν οὐ φυλασσόντων τὰ φυσικά. But the fact is that this\r\narrangement, strange as it may seem, is conformable to the practice of the\r\ntimes when these divisions were finally settled. Both in the Institutes\r\nand in the Digest of Justinian the first paragraph is always cited as pr.\r\n(i.e. _principium_, προοίμιον, _Preface_), and what we should regard as\r\nthe second paragraph is numbered as the first, and so on throughout the\r\nwhole work(65).\r\n\r\nThe τίτλοι in St. Matthew amount to sixty-eight, in St. Mark to\r\nforty-eight, in St. Luke to eighty-three, in St. John to eighteen. This\r\nmode of division, although not met with in the Vatican and Sinaitic\r\nmanuscripts, is found in the Codices Alexandrinus and Ephraemi of the\r\nfifth century, and in the Codex Nitriensis of the sixth, each of which has\r\ntables of the τίτλοι prefixed to the several Gospels: but the Codices\r\nAlexandrinus, Rossanensis, and Dublinensis of St. Matthew, and that\r\nportion of the purple Cotton fragment which is in the Vatican, exhibit\r\nthem in their usual position, at the top and bottom of the pages. Thus it\r\nappears that they were too generally diffused in the fifth century not to\r\nhave originated at an earlier period; although we must concede that the\r\nκεφάλαιον spoken of by Clement of Alexandria (Stromat. i) when quoting\r\nDan. xii. 12, or by Athanasius (contra Arium) on Act. ii, and the\r\n_Capitulum_ mentioned by Tertullian (ad Uxorem ii. 2) in reference to 1\r\nCor. vii. 12, contain no certain allusions to any specific divisions of\r\nthe sacred text, but only to the particular paragraphs or passages in\r\nwhich their citations stand. Except that the contrary habit has grown\r\ninveterate(66), it were much to be desired that the term τίτλοι should be\r\napplied to these longer divisions, at least in the Gospels; but since\r\nusage has affixed the term κεφάλαια to the larger chapters and sections to\r\nthe smaller, and τίτλοι only to the subjects or headings of the former, it\r\nwould be useless to follow any other system of names.\r\n\r\n3. The Ammonian Sections were not constructed, like the Vatican divisions\r\nand the τίτλοι, for the purpose of easy reference, or distributed like\r\nthem according to the breaks in the sense, but for a wholly different\r\npurpose. So far as we can ascertain, the design of Tatian’s Harmony was\r\nsimply to present to Christian readers a single connected history of our\r\nLord, by taking from the four Evangelists indifferently whatsoever best\r\nsuited his purpose(67). As this plan could scarcely be executed without\r\n_omitting_ some portions of the sacred text, it is not surprising that\r\nTatian, possibly without any evil intention, should have incurred the\r\ngrave charge of mutilating Holy Scripture(68). A more scholar-like and\r\nuseful attempt was subsequently made by Ammonius of Alexandria, early in\r\nthe third century [A.D. 220], who, by the side of St. Matthew’s Gospel,\r\nwhich he selected as his standard, arranged in parallel columns, as it\r\nwould seem, the corresponding passages of the other three Evangelists, so\r\nas to exhibit them all at once to the reader’s eye; St. Matthew in his\r\nproper order, the rest as the necessity of abiding by St. Matthew’s order\r\nprescribed. This is the account given by the celebrated Eusebius, Bishop\r\nof Caesarea, the Church historian, who in the fourth century, in his\r\nletter to Carpianus, described his own most ingenious system of Harmony,\r\nas founded on, or at least as suggested by, the labours of Ammonius(69).\r\nIt has been generally thought that the κεφάλαια, of which St. Matthew\r\ncontains 355, St. Mark 236(70), St. Luke 342, St. John 232, in all 1165,\r\nwere made by Ammonius for the purpose of his work, and they have commonly\r\nreceived the name of the Ammonian sections: but this opinion was called in\r\nquestion by Bp. Lloyd (Nov. Test. Oxon. 1827, Monitum, pp. viii-xi), who\r\nstrongly urges that, in his Epistle to Carpianus, Eusebius not only\r\nrefrains from ascribing these numerical divisions to Ammonius (whose\r\nlabours in this particular, as once seemed the case with Tatian’s, must in\r\nthat case be deemed to have perished utterly), but he almost implies that\r\nthey had their origin at the same time with his own ten canons, with which\r\nthey are so intimately connected(71). That they were essential to\r\nEusebius’ scheme is plain enough; their place in Ammonius’ parallel\r\nHarmony is not easily understood, unless indeed (what is nowhere stated,\r\nbut rather the contrary) he did not set the passages from the other\r\nGospels at full length by the side of St. Matthew’s, but only these\r\nnumerical references to them(72).\r\n\r\nThere is, however, one ground for hesitation before we ascribe the\r\nsections, as well as the canons, to Eusebius; namely, that not a few\r\nancient manuscripts (e.g. Codd. FHY) contain the former, while they omit\r\nthe latter. Of palimpsests indeed it might be said with reason, that the\r\nrough process which so nearly obliterated the ink of the older writing,\r\nwould completely remove the coloured paint (κιννάβαρις, _vermilion_,\r\nprescribed by Eusebius, though blue or green is occasionally found) in\r\nwhich the canons were invariably noted; hence we need not wonder at their\r\nabsence from the Codices Ephraemi, Nitriensis (R), Dublinensis (Z), Codd.\r\nIWb of Tischendorf, and the Wolfenbüttel fragments (PQ), in all which the\r\nsections are yet legible in ink. The Codex Sinaiticus contains both; but\r\nTischendorf decidedly pronounces them to be in a later hand. In the Codex\r\nBezae too, as well as the Codex Cyprius (K), even the Ammonian sections,\r\nwithout the canons, are by later hands, though the latter has prefixed the\r\nlist or table of the canons. Of the oldest copies the Cod. Alex. (A),\r\nTischendorf’s Codd. WaΘ, the Cotton frag. (N), and Codd. Beratinus and\r\nRossanensis alone contain both the sections and the canons. Even in more\r\nmodern cursive books the latter are often deficient, though the former are\r\npresent. This peculiarity we have observed in Burney 23, in the British\r\nMuseum, of the twelfth century, although the Epistle to Carpianus stands\r\nat the beginning; in a rather remarkable copy of about the twelfth\r\ncentury, in the Cambridge University Library (Mm. 6. 9, Scholz Evan. 440),\r\nin which, however, the table of canons but not the Epistle to Carpianus\r\nprecedes; in the Gonville and Caius Gospels of the twelfth century (Evan.\r\n59), and in a manuscript of about the thirteenth century at Trinity\r\nCollege, Cambridge (B. x. 17)(73). These facts certainly seem to indicate\r\nthat in the judgement of critics and transcribers, whatever that judgement\r\nmay be deemed worth, the Ammonian sections had a previous existence to the\r\nEusebian canons, as well as served for an independent purpose(74).\r\n\r\nIn his letter to Carpianus, their inventor clearly yet briefly describes\r\nthe purpose of his canons, ten in number. The first contains a list of\r\nseventy-one places in which all the four Evangelists have a narrative,\r\ndiscourse, or saying in common: the second of 111 places in which the\r\nthree Matthew, Mark, Luke agree: the third of twenty-two places common to\r\nMatthew, Luke, John: the fourth of twenty-six passages common to Matthew,\r\nMark, John: the fifth of eighty-two places in which the two Matthew, Luke\r\ncoincide: the sixth of forty-seven places wherein Matthew, Mark agree: the\r\nseventh of seven places common to Matthew and John: the eighth of fourteen\r\nplaces common to Luke and Mark: the ninth of twenty-one places in which\r\nLuke and John agree: the tenth of sixty-two passages of Matthew,\r\ntwenty-one of Mark, seventy-one of Luke, and ninety-seven of John which\r\nhave no parallels, but are peculiar to a single Evangelist. Under each of\r\nthe 1165 so-named Ammonian sections, in its proper place in the margin of\r\na manuscript, is put in coloured ink the number of that Eusebian canon to\r\nwhich it refers. On looking for that section in the proper table or canon,\r\nthere will also be found the parallel place or places in the other\r\nGospels, each indicated by its proper numeral, and so readily searched\r\nout. A single example will serve to explain our meaning. In the facsimile\r\nof the Cotton fragment (Plate v. No. 14), in the margin of the passage\r\n(John xv. 20) we see _ΡΛΘ_ over Γ, where ΡΑΘ (139) is the proper section\r\nof St. John, Γ (3) the number of the canon. On searching the third\r\nEusebian table we read MT. [symbol], Λ. _νη_, ΙΩ. _ρλθ_ and thus we learn\r\nthat the first clause of John xv. 20 is parallel in sense to the ninetieth\r\n([symbol]) section of St. Matthew (x. 24), and to the fifty-eighth (_νη_)\r\nof St. Luke (vi. 40). The advantage of such a system of parallels to the\r\nexact study of the Gospels is too evident to need insisting on.\r\n\r\n4. The Acts of the Apostles and the Epistles are also divided into\r\n_chapters_ (κεφάλαια), in design precisely the same as the κεφάλαια or\r\nτίτλοι of the Gospels, and nearly like them in length. Since there is no\r\ntrace of these chapters in the two great Codices Alexandrinus and\r\nEphraemi, of the fifth century (which yet exhibit the τίτλοι, the\r\nsections, and one of them the canons), it seems reasonable to assume that\r\nthey are of later date. They are sometimes connected with the name of\r\nEuthalius, deacon of Alexandria, afterwards Bishop of Sulci(75), whom we\r\nhave already spoken of as the reputed author of Scriptural stichometry\r\n(_above_, p. 53). We learn, however, from Euthalius’ own Prologue to his\r\nedition of St. Paul’s Epistles (A.D. 458,) that the “summary of the\r\nchapters” (and consequently the numbers of the chapters themselves) was\r\ntaken from the work of “one of our wisest and pious fathers(76),” i.e.\r\nsome Bishop that he does not wish to particularize, whom Mill (Proleg. N.\r\nT. § 907) conjectures to be Theodore of Mopsuestia, who lay under the\r\ncensure of the Church. Soon after(77) the publication of St. Paul’s\r\nEpistles, on the suggestion of one Athanasius, then a priest and\r\nafterwards Patriarch of Alexandria, Euthalius put forth a similar edition\r\nof the Acts and Catholic Epistles(78), also divided into chapters, with a\r\nsummary of contents at the head of each chapter. Even these he is thought\r\nto have derived (at least in the Acts) from the manuscript of Pamphilus\r\nthe Martyr [d. 308], to whom the same order of chapters is ascribed in a\r\ndocument published by Montfaucon (Bibliotheca Coislin. p. 78); the rather\r\nas Euthalius fairly professes to have compared his book in the Acts and\r\nCatholic Epistles “with the copies in the library at Caesarea” which once\r\nbelonged to “Eusebius the friend of Pamphilus(79).” The Apocalypse still\r\nremains. It was divided, about the end of the fifth century, by Andreas,\r\nArchbishop of the Cappadocian Caesarea, into twenty-four _paragraphs_\r\n(λόγοι), corresponding to the number of the elders about the throne (Apoc.\r\niv. 4); each paragraph being subdivided into three _chapters_\r\n(κεφάλαια)(80). The summaries which Andreas wrote of his seventy-two\r\nchapters are still reprinted in Mill’s and other large editions of the\r\nGreek Testament.\r\n\r\n5. To Euthalius has been also referred a division of the Acts into sixteen\r\nlessons (ἀναγνώσεις) and of the Pauline Epistles into thirty-one (see\r\ntable on p. 67); but these lessons are quite different from the much\r\nshorter ones adopted by the Greek Church. He is also said to have numbered\r\nin each Epistle of St. Paul the quotations from the Old Testament(81),\r\nwhich are still noted in many of our manuscripts, and is the first known\r\nto have used that reckoning of the στίχοι which was formerly annexed we\r\nknow not when to the Gospels and Epistles, as well as to the Acts. Besides\r\nthe division of the text into στίχοι or _lines_ (_above_, p. 52) we find\r\nin the Gospels alone another division into ῥήματα or ῥήσεις “sentences,”\r\ndiffering but little from the στίχοι in number. Of these last the precise\r\nnumbers vary in different copies, though not considerably: whether that\r\nvariation arose from the circumstance that ancient numbers were\r\nrepresented by letters and so easily became corrupted, or from a different\r\nmode of arranging the στίχοι and ῥήματα adopted by the various scribes.\r\n\r\n6. It is proper to state that the _subscriptions_ (ὑπογραφαί) appended to\r\nSt. Paul’s Epistles in many manuscripts, and retained even in the\r\nAuthorized English version of the New Testament, are also said to be the\r\ncomposition of Euthalius. In the best copies they are somewhat shorter in\r\nform, but in any shape they do no credit to the care or skill of their\r\nauthor, whoever he may be. “Six of these subscriptions,” writes Paley in\r\nthat masterpiece of acute reasoning, the Horae Paulinae, “are false or\r\nimprobable;” that is, they are either absolutely contradicted by the\r\ncontents of the epistle [1 Cor., Galat., 1 Tim.], or are difficult to be\r\nreconciled with them [1, 2 Thess., Tit.].\r\n\r\nThe _subscriptions_ to the Gospels have not, we believe, been assigned to\r\nany particular author, and being seldom found in printed copies of the\r\nGreek Testament or in modern versions, are little known to the general\r\nreader. In the earliest manuscripts the subscriptions, as well as the\r\n_titles_ of the books, were of the simplest character. Κατὰ Μαθθαῖον, κατὰ\r\nΜάρκον, &c. is all that the Codd. Vaticanus and Sinaiticus have, whether\r\nat the beginning or the end. Εὐαγγέλιον κατὰ Ματθαῖον is the subscription\r\nto the first Gospel in the Codex Alexandrinus; εὐαγγέλιον κατὰ Μάρκον is\r\nplaced at the beginning of the second Gospel in the same manuscript, and\r\nthe self-same words at the end of it by Codices Alex. and Ephraemi: in the\r\nCodex Bezae (in which St. John stands second in order) we merely read\r\nεὐαγγέλιον κατὰ Μαθθαῖον ἐτελέσθη, ἄρχεται εὐαγγέλιον κατὰ Ἰωάννην. The\r\nsame is the case throughout the New Testament. After a while the titles\r\nbecome more elaborate, and the subscriptions afford more information, the\r\ntruth of which it would hardly be safe to vouch for. The earliest worth\r\nnotice are found in the Codex Cyprius (K) of the eighth or ninth century,\r\nwhich, together with those of several other copies, are given in Scholz’s\r\nProlegomena N. T. vol. i. pp. xxix, xxx. _ad fin. Matthaei_: Τὸ κατὰ\r\nΜατθαῖον εὐαγγέλιον ἐξεδόθη ὑπ᾽ αὐτοῦ ἐν ἱεροσολύμοις μετὰ χρόνους ἡ\r\n[ὀκτὼ] τῆς τοῦ Χριστοῦ ἀναλήψεως. _Ad fin. Marci_: Τὸ κατὰ Μάρκον\r\nεὐαγγέλιον ἐξεδόθη μετὰ χρόνους δέκα τῆς τοῦ Χριστοῦ ἀναλήψεως. Those to\r\nthe other two Gospels exactly resemble St. Mark’s, that of St. Luke\r\nhowever being dated fifteen, that of St. John thirty-two years after our\r\nLord’s Ascension, periods in all probability far too early to be correct.\r\n\r\n7. The foreign matter so often inserted in later manuscripts has more\r\nvalue for the antiquarian than for the critic. That splendid copy of the\r\nGospels Lambeth 1178, of the tenth or eleventh century, contains more such\r\nthan is often found, set off by fine illuminations. At the end of each of\r\nthe first three Gospels (but not of the fourth) are several pages relating\r\nto them extracted from Cosmas Indicopleustes, who made the voyage which\r\nprocured him his cognomen about A.D. 522; also some iambic verses of no\r\ngreat excellence, as may well be supposed. In golden letters we read: _ad\r\nfin. Matth._ ἰστέον ὅτι τὸ κατὰ Ματθαῖον εὐαγγέλιον ἑβραΐδι διαλέκτωι\r\nγραφὲν ὑπ᾽ αὐτοῦ; ἐν ἱερουσαλὴμ ἐξεδόθη; ἑρμηνεύθη δὲ ὑπὸ ἱωάννου;\r\nἐξηγεῖται δὲ τὴν κατὰ ἄνθρωπον τοῦ χ_υ_ γένεσιν, καί ἐστιν ἀνθρωπόμορφον\r\nτοῦτο τὸ εὐαγγέλιον. The last clause alludes to Apoc. iv. 7, wherein the\r\nfour living creatures were currently believed to be typical of the four\r\nGospels(82). _Ad fin. Marc._ ἰστέον ὅτι τὸ κατὰ Μάρκον εὐαγγέλιον\r\nὑπηγορεύθη ὑπὸ Πέτρου ἐν ῥώμηι; ἐποιήσατο δὲ τὴν ἀρχὴν ἀπὸ τοῦ προφητικοῦ\r\nλόγου τοῦ ἐξ ὕψους ἐπιόντος τοῦ Ἡσαΐου; τὴν πτερωτικὴν εἰκόνα τοῦ\r\nεὐαγγελίου δεικνύς. _Ad fin. Luc._ ἰστέον ὅτι τὸ κατὰ Λουκᾶν εὐαγγέλιον\r\nὑπηγορεύθη ὑπὸ Παύλου ἐν ῥώμηι; ἅτε δὲ ἱερατικοῦ χαρακτῆρος ὑπάρχοντος ἀπὸ\r\nΖαχαρίου τοῦ ἱερέως θυμιῶντος ἤρξατο. The reader will desire no more of\r\nthis.\r\n\r\n8. The oldest manuscript known to be accompanied by a _catena_ (or\r\ncontinuous commentary by different authors) is the palimpsest Codex\r\nZacynthius (Ξ of Tregelles), an uncial of the eighth century. Such books\r\nare not common, but there is a very full commentary in minute letters,\r\nsurrounding the large text in a noble copy of the Gospels, of the twelfth\r\ncentury, which belonged to the late Sir Thomas Phillipps (Middle Hill\r\n13975, since removed to Cheltenham), yet uncollated; another of St. Paul’s\r\nEpistles (No. 27) belongs to the University Library at Cambridge (Ff. 1.\r\n30). The Apocalypse is often attended with the exposition of Andreas (p.\r\n64), or of Arethas, also Archbishop of the Cappadocian Caesarea in the\r\ntenth century, or (what is more usual) with a sort of epitome of the two\r\n(e.g. Parham No. 17), above, below, and in the margin beside the text, in\r\nmuch smaller characters. In _cursive_ manuscripts only the subject\r\n(ὑπόθεσις), especially that written by Oecumenius in the tenth century,\r\nsometimes stands as a _Prologue_ before each book, but not so often before\r\nthe Gospels or Apocalypse as the Acts and Epistles. Before the Acts we\r\noccasionally meet with Euthalius’ Chronology of St. Paul’s Travels, or\r\nanother Ἀποδημία Παύλου. The Leicester manuscript contains between the\r\nPauline Epistles and the Acts (1) An Exposition of the Creed and statement\r\nof the errors condemned by the seven general Councils, ending with the\r\nsecond at Nice. (2) Lives of the Apostles, followed by an exact\r\ndescription of the limits of the five Patriarchates. The Christ Church\r\ncopy Wake 12 also has after the Apocalypse some seven or eight pages of a\r\nTreatise Περὶ τῶν ἁγίων καὶ οἰκουμενικῶν _ζ_ συνόδων, including some\r\nnotice περὶ τοπικῶν συνόδων. Similar treatises may be more frequent in\r\nmanuscripts of the Greek Testament than we are at present aware of.\r\n\r\n          Vatican     τίτλοι   κεφάλαια   στίχοι   ῥήματα   Modern\r\n          MS.

We have not thought it needful to insert in this place either a list of\r\nthe τίτλοι of the Gospels, or of the κεφάλαια of the rest of the New\r\nTestament, or the tables of the Eusebian canons, inasmuch as they are all\r\naccessible in such ordinary books as Stephen’s Greek Testament 1550 and\r\nMill’s of 1707, 1710. The Eusebian canons are given in Bishop Lloyd’s\r\nOxford Greek Test. of 1827 &c. and in Tischendorf’s of 1859. We exhibit,\r\nhowever, for the sake of comparison, a tabular view of “Ancient and Modern\r\nDivisions of the New Testament.” The numbers of the ῥήματα and στίχοι in\r\nthe Gospels are derived from the most approved sources, but a synopsis of\r\nthe variations of manuscripts in this respect has been drawn up by Scholz,\r\nProlegomena N. T. vol. i. Cap. v, pp. xxviii, xxix(84). A computation of\r\ntheir number, as also of that of the ἀναγνώσματα, is often given in the\r\nsubscription at the end of a book.\r\n\r\n10. On the divisions into chapters and verses prevailing in our modern\r\nBibles we need not dwell long. For many centuries the Latin Church used\r\nthe Greek τίτλοι (which they called _breves_) with the Euthalian κεφάλαια,\r\nand some of their copies even retained the calculation by στίχοι: but\r\nabout A.D. 1248 Cardinal Hugo de Sancto Caro, while preparing a\r\nConcordance, or index of declinable words, for the _whole Bible_, divided\r\nit into its present chapters, subdividing them in turn into several parts\r\nby placing the letters A, B, C, D &c. in the margin, at equal distances\r\nfrom each other, as we still see in many old printed books, e.g. Stephen’s\r\nN. T. of 1550. Cardinal Hugo’s divisions, unless indeed he merely adopted\r\nthem from Lanfranc or some other scholar, such as was very probably\r\nStephen Langton the celebrated Archbishop of Canterbury, soon took\r\npossession of copies of the Latin Vulgate; they gradually obtained a place\r\nin later Greek manuscripts, especially those written in the West of\r\nEurope, and are found in the earliest printed and all later editions of\r\nthe Greek Testament, though still unknown to the Eastern Church. They\r\ncertainly possess no strong claim on our preference, although they cannot\r\nnow be superseded. The chapters are inconveniently and capriciously\r\nunequal in length; occasionally too they are distributed with much lack of\r\njudgement. Thus Matt. xv. 39 belongs to ch. xvi, and perhaps ch. xix. 30\r\nto ch. xx; Mark ix. 1 properly appertains to the preceding chapter; Luke\r\nxxi. 1-4 had better be united with ch. xx, as in Mark xii. 41-44; Acts v\r\nmight as well commence with Acts iv. 32; Acts viii. 1 (or at least its\r\nfirst clause) should not have been separated from ch. vii; Acts xxi\r\nconcludes with strange abruptness. Bp. Terrot (on Ernesti’s Institutes,\r\nvol. ii. p. 21) rightly affixes 1 Cor. iv. 1-5 to ch. iii. Add that 1 Cor.\r\nxi. 1 belongs to ch. x; 2 Cor. iv. 18 and vi. 18 to ch. v and ch. vii\r\nrespectively: Col. iv. 1 must clearly go with ch. iii.\r\n\r\nIn commendation of the modern verses still less can be said. As they are\r\nstated to have been constructed after the model of the ancient στίχοι\r\n(called “_versus_” in the Latin manuscripts), we have placed in the Table\r\nthe exact number of each for every book in the New Testament. Of the\r\nστίχοι we reckon 19241 in all, of the modern verses 7959(85), so that on\r\nthe average (for we have seen that the manuscript variations in the number\r\nof στίχοι are but inconsiderable) we may calculate about five στίχοι to\r\nevery two modern verses. The fact is that some such division is, simply\r\nindispensable to every accurate reader of Scripture; and Cardinal Hugo’s\r\ndivisions by letters of the alphabet, as well as those adopted by Sanctes\r\nPagninus in his Latin version of the whole Bible (1528), having proved\r\ninconveniently large, Robert Stephen, the justly celebrated printer and\r\neditor of the Greek Testament, undertook to form a system of\r\nverse-divisions, taking for his model the short verses into which the\r\nHebrew Bible had already been divided, as it would seem by Rabbi Nathan,\r\nin the preceding century. We are told by Henry Stephen (Praef.\r\nConcordantiae) that his father Robert executed this design on a journey\r\nfrom Paris to Lyons “_inter equitandum_(86);” that is, we presume, while\r\nresting at the inns on the road. Certain it is that, although every such\r\ndivision must be in some measure arbitrary, a very little care would have\r\nspared us many of the disadvantages attending that which Robert Stephen\r\nfirst published at Geneva in his Greek Testament of 1551, from which it\r\nwas introduced into the text of the Genevan English Testament of 1557,\r\ninto Beza’s Greek Testament of 1565, and thence into subsequent editions.\r\nIt is now too late to correct the errors of the verse-divisions, but they\r\ncan be neutralized, at least in a great degree, by the plan adopted by\r\nmodern critics, of banishing both the verses and the chapters into the\r\nmargin, and breaking the text into paragraphs, better suited to the sense.\r\nThe _pericopae_ or sections of Bengel(87) (whose labours will be described\r\nin their proper place) have been received with general approbation, and\r\nadopted, with some modification, by several recent editors. Much pains\r\nwere bestowed on their arrangement of the paragraphs by the Revisers of\r\nthe English version of 1881.\r\n\r\n11. We now come to the _contents_ of manuscripts of the Greek Testament,\r\nand must distinguish regular copies of the sacred volume or of parts of it\r\nfrom Lectionaries, or Church-lesson books, containing only extracts,\r\narranged in the order of Divine Service daily throughout the year. The\r\nlatter we will consider presently: with regard to the former it is right\r\nto bear in mind, that comparatively few copies of the whole New Testament\r\nremain; the usual practice being to write the four Gospels in one volume,\r\nthe Acts and Epistles in another: manuscripts of the Apocalypse, which was\r\nlittle used for public worship, being much rarer than those of the other\r\nbooks. Occasionally the Gospels, Acts, and Epistles form a single volume;\r\nsometimes the Apocalypse is added to other books; as to the Pauline\r\nEpistles in Lambeth 1186, or even to the Gospels, in a later hand (e.g.\r\nCambridge University Libr. Dd. 9. 69: Gospels No. 60, _dated_ A.D. 1297).\r\nThe Apocalypse, being a short work, is often found bound up in volumes\r\ncontaining very miscellaneous matter (e.g. Vatican. 2066 or B; Brit. Mus.\r\nHarleian. 5678, No. 31; and Oxon. Barocc. 48, No. 28). The Codex\r\nSinaiticus of Tischendorf is the more precious, in that it happily\r\nexhibits the whole New Testament complete: so would also the Codices\r\nAlexandrinus and Ephraemi, but that they are sadly mutilated: no other\r\nuncial copies have this advantage, and very few cursives. In England only\r\nfive such are known, the great Codex Leicestrensis, which is imperfect at\r\nthe beginning and end; Butler 2 (Evan. 201) Additional 11837, dated A.D.\r\n1357, and (Evan. 584) Additional 17469, both in the British Museum;\r\nCanonici 34 (Evan. 488) in the Bodleian, dated A.D. 1515-16. Additional\r\nMS. 28815 (Evan. 603, and Paul 266, and Apoc. 89) in the British Museum\r\nand B-C. II. 4 at Sir Roger Cholmely’s School, Highgate, are separated\r\nportions of one complete copy. The Apocalypse in the well-known Codex\r\nMontfortianus at Dublin is usually considered to be by a later hand.\r\nBesides these Scholz enumerates only nineteen foreign copies of the whole\r\nNew Testament(88); making but twenty-four in all, as far as was then\r\nknown, out of the vast mass of extant documents.\r\n\r\n12. Whether copies contain the whole or a part of the sacred volume, the\r\ngeneral _order_ of the books is the following: Gospels, Acts, Catholic\r\nEpistles, Pauline Epistles, Apocalypse. A solitary manuscript of the\r\nfifteenth century (Venet. 10, Evan. 209) places the Gospels between the\r\nPauline Epistles and the Apocalypse(89); in the Codices Sinaiticus,\r\nLeicestrensis, Fabri (Evan. 90), and Montfortianus, as in the Bodleian\r\nCanonici 34, the copy in the King’s Library Brit. Mus. (Act. 20), and the\r\nComplutensian edition (1514), the Pauline Epistles precede the Acts. The\r\nPauline Epistles stand between the Acts and the Catholic Epistles in\r\nPhillipps 1284, Evan. 527; Parham 71. 6, Evan. 534; Upsal, Sparfwenfeldt\r\n42, Acts 68; Paris Reg. 102 A, Acts 119; Reg. 103 A, Acts 120. In Oxford\r\nBodl. Miscell. 74 the order is Acts, Cath. Epp., Apocalypse, Paul. Epp.,\r\nbut an earlier hand wrote from 3 John onwards. In Evan. 51 Dr. C. R.\r\nGregory points out minute indications that the scribe, not the binder, set\r\nthe Gospels last. In the Memphitic and Thebaic the Acts follow the\r\nCatholic Epistles (_see_ below, vol. ii, chap. iii). The Codex Basiliensis\r\n(No. 4 of the Epistles), Acts Cod. 134, Brit. Mus. Addl. 19388, Lambeth\r\n1182, 1183, and Burdett-Coutts III. 1, have the Pauline Epistles\r\nimmediately after the Acts and before the Catholic Epistles, as in our\r\npresent Bibles. Scholz’s Evan. 368 stands thus, St. John’s Gospel,\r\nApocalypse, then all the Epistles; in Havniens. 1 (Cod. 234 of the\r\nGospels, A.D. 1278) the order appears to be Acts, Paul. Ep., Cath. Ep.,\r\nGospels; in Ambros. Z 34 _sup._ at Milan, Dean Burgon testifies that the\r\nCatholic and Pauline Epistles are followed by the Gospels; in Basil. B.\r\nvi. 27 or Cod. 1, the Gospels have been bound after the Acts and Epistles;\r\nwhile in Evan. 175 the Apocalypse stands between the Acts and Catholic\r\nEpistles; in Evan. 51 the binder has set the Gospels last: these, however,\r\nare mere accidental exceptions to the prevailing rule(90). The four\r\nGospels are almost invariably found in their familiar order, although in\r\nthe Codex Bezae (as we partly saw above, p. 65) they stand Matthew, John,\r\nLuke, Mark(91); in the Codex Monacensis (X) John, Luke, Mark, Matthew (but\r\ntwo leaves of Matthew _also_ stand before John), also in the Latin _k_; in\r\nCod. 90 (Fabri) John, Luke, Matthew, Mark; in Cod. 399 at Turin John,\r\nLuke, Matthew, an arrangement which Dr. Hort refers to the Commentary of\r\nTitus of Bostra on St. Luke which accompanies it; in the Curetonian Syriac\r\nversion Matthew, Mark, John, Luke. In the Pauline Epistles that to the\r\nHebrews immediately follows the second to the Thessalonians in the four\r\ngreat Codices Vaticanus, Sinaiticus, Alexandrinus, and Ephraemi(92): in\r\nthe copy from which the Cod. Vatican. was taken the Hebrews followed the\r\nGalatians (_above_, p. 57). The Codex Claromontanus, the document next in\r\nimportance to these four, sets the Colossians appropriately enough next to\r\nits kindred and contemporaneous Epistle to the Ephesians, but postpones\r\nthat to the Hebrews to Philemon, as in our present Bibles: an arrangement\r\nwhich at first, no doubt, originated in the early scruples prevailing in\r\nthe Western Church, with respect to the authorship and canonical authority\r\nof that divine epistle.\r\n\r\n13. We must now describe the _Lectionaries_ or Service-books of the Greek\r\nChurch, in which the portions of Scripture publicly read throughout the\r\nyear are set down in chronological order, without regard to their actual\r\nplaces in the sacred volume. In length and general arrangement they\r\nresemble not so much the Lessons as the Epistles and Gospels in our\r\nEnglish Book of Common Prayer, only that every day in the year has its own\r\nproper portion, and the numerous Saints’ days independent services of\r\ntheir own. These Lectionaries consist either of lessons from the Gospels,\r\nand are then called _Evangelistaria_ or _Evangeliaria_\r\n(εὐαγγελιστάρια)(93); or from the Acts and Epistles; termed\r\n_Praxapostolos_ (πραξαπόστολος) or _Apostolos_(94): the general name of\r\nLectionary is often, though incorrectly, confined to the latter class. A\r\nfew books called ἀποστολοευαγγέλια have lessons taken both from the\r\nGospels and the Apostolic writings. In _Euchologies_, or Books of Offices,\r\nwherein both the _Apostolos_ and the _Gospels_ are found, the former\r\nalways precede in each Office, just as the Epistle precedes the Gospel in\r\nthe Service-books of Western Christendom. The peculiar arrangement of\r\nLectionaries renders them very unfit for the hasty, partial, cursory\r\ncollation which has befallen too many manuscripts of the other class, and\r\nthis circumstance, joined with the irksomeness of using Service-books\r\nnever familiar to the habits even of scholars in this part of Europe, has\r\ncaused these documents to be so little consulted, that the contents of the\r\nvery best and oldest among them have until recently been little known.\r\nMatthaei, of whose elaborate and important edition of the Greek Testament\r\n(12 tom. Riga 1782-88) we shall give an account hereafter, has done\r\nexcellent service in this department; two of his best copies, the uncials\r\nB and H (Nos. 47, 50), being Evangelistaria. The present writer also has\r\ncollated three noble uncials of the same rank, Arundel 547 being of the\r\nninth century, Parham 18 bearing date A.D. 980, Harleian 5598, A.D. 995.\r\nNot a few other uncial Lectionaries remain quite neglected, for though\r\nnone of them perhaps are older than the eighth century, the ancient\r\ncharacter was retained for these costly and splendid Service-books till\r\nabout the eleventh century (Montfaucon, Palaeogr. Graec. p. 260), before\r\nwhich time the cursive hand was generally used in other Biblical\r\nmanuscripts. There is, of course, no place in a Lectionary for divisions\r\nby κεφάλαια, for the so-called Ammonian sections, or for the canons of\r\nEusebius.\r\n\r\nThe division of the New Testament into Church-lessons was, however, of far\r\nmore remote antiquity than the employment of separate volumes to contain\r\nthem. Towards the end of the fourth century, that golden age of Patristic\r\ntheology, Chrysostom recognizes some stated order of the lessons as\r\nfamiliar to all his hearers, for he exhorts them to peruse and mark\r\nbeforehand the passages (περικοπαί(95)) of the Gospels which were to be\r\npublicly read to them the ensuing Sunday or Saturday(96). All the\r\ninformation we can gather favours the notion that there was no great\r\ndifference between the calendar of Church-lessons in earlier and later\r\nstages. Not only do they correspond in all cases where such agreement is\r\nnatural, as in the proper services for the great feasts and fasts, but in\r\nsuch purely arbitrary arrangements as the reading of the book of Genesis,\r\ninstead of the Gospels, on the week days of Lent; of the Acts all the time\r\nbetween Easter and Pentecost(97); and the selection of St. Matthew’s\r\nhistory of the Passion alone at the Liturgy on Good Friday(98). The\r\nearliest formal _Menologium_, or Table of proper lessons, now extant is\r\nprefixed to the Codex Cyprius (K) of the eighth or ninth century; another\r\nis found in the Codex Campianus (M), which is perhaps a little later; they\r\nare more frequently found than the contrary in later manuscripts of every\r\nkind; while there are comparatively few copies that have not been\r\naccommodated to ecclesiastical use either by their original scribe or a\r\nlater hand, by means of noting the proper days for each lesson (often in\r\nred ink) at the top or bottom or in the margin of the several pages. Not\r\nonly in the margin, but even in the text itself are perpetually\r\ninterpolated, mostly in vermilion or red ink, the beginning (ἀρχή or αρχ)\r\nand ending (τέλος or τελ) of each lesson, and the several words to be\r\ninserted or substituted in order to suit the purpose of public reading;\r\nfrom which source (as we have stated above, p. 11) various readings have\r\nalmost unavoidably sprung: e.g. in Acts iii. 11 τοῦ ἰαθέντος χωλοῦ of the\r\nLectionaries ultimately displaced αὐτοῦ from the text itself.\r\n\r\nWe purpose to annex to this Chapter a table of lessons throughout the\r\nyear, according to the use laid down in Synaxaria, Menologies, and\r\nLectionaries, as well to enable the student to compare the proper lessons\r\nof the Greek Church with our own, as to facilitate reference to the\r\nmanuscripts themselves, which are now placed almost out of the reach of\r\nthe inexperienced. On comparing the manner in which the terms are used by\r\ndifferent scribes and authors, we conceive that _Synaxarion_ (συναξάριον)\r\nis, like Eclogadion, a name used for a table of daily lessons for the year\r\nbeginning at Easter, and that these have varied but slightly in the course\r\nof many ages throughout the whole Eastern Church; that tables of Saints’\r\nday lessons, called _Menologies_, (μηνολόγιον), distributed in order of\r\nthe months from September (when the new year and the indiction began) to\r\nAugust, differed widely from each other, both in respect to the lessons\r\nread and the days kept holy(99). While the great feasts remained entirely\r\nthe same, different generations and provinces and even dioceses had their\r\nfavourite worthies, whose memory they specially cherished; so that the\r\ncharacter of the menology (which sometimes forms a larger, sometimes but a\r\nsmall portion of a Lectionary) will often guide us to the country and\r\ndistrict in which the volume itself was written. The Parham\r\nEvangelistarium 18 affords us a conspicuous example of this fact: coming\r\nfrom a region of which we know but little (Ciscissa in Cappadocia Prima),\r\nits menology in many particulars but little resembles those usually met\r\nwith(100).\r\n\r\n14. It only remains to say a few words about the _notation_ adopted to\r\nindicate the several classes of manuscripts of the Greek Testament. These\r\nclasses are six in number; that containing the Gospels (_Evangelia_ or\r\n_Evan._), or the Acts and Catholic Epistles (_Act._ and _Cath._), or the\r\nPauline Epistles (_Paul._), or the Apocalypse (_Apoc._), or Lectionaries\r\nof the Gospels (_Evangelistaria_ or _Evst._), or those of the Acts and\r\nEpistles (_Apostolos_ or _Apost._). When one manuscript (as often happens)\r\nbelongs to more than one of these classes, its distinct parts are numbered\r\nseparately, so that a copy of the whole New Testament will appear in four\r\nlists, and be reckoned four times over. All critics are agreed in\r\ndistinguishing the documents written in the uncial character by capital\r\nletters; the custom having originated in the accidental circumstance that\r\nthe Codex Alexandrinus was designated as Cod. A in the lower margin of\r\nWalton’s Polyglott. Lectionaries in uncial letters are not marked by\r\ncapitals, but by Arabic numerals, like cursive manuscripts of all\r\nclasses(101). Of course no system can escape some attendant evils. Even\r\nthe catalogue of the later manuscripts is often upon its first appearance\r\nfull of mis-statements, of repetitions and loose descriptions, which must\r\nbe remedied and supplied in subsequent examination, so far as opportunity\r\nis granted from time to time. In describing the uncials (as we purpose to\r\ndo in the two next chapters) our course is tolerably plain; but the lists\r\nthat comprise the last eight chapters of this volume, and which\r\nrespectively detail the cursive manuscripts and the Lectionaries of the\r\nGreek Testament, must be regarded only as an approximation to what such an\r\nenumeration ought to be, though much pains and time have been spent upon\r\nthem: the comparatively few copies which seem to be sufficiently known are\r\ndistinguished by an asterisk from their less fortunate kindred.\r\n\r\nFor indeed the only method of grappling with the perplexity produced by\r\nthe large additions of manuscripts, especially of the cursive character,\r\nwhich constant discovery has effected during late years, is to enumerate\r\narithmetically those which have been supplied from time to time, as was\r\ndone in the last edition of this work, carefully noting if they have been\r\nexamined by a competent judge or especially if they have been properly\r\ncollated. In the Appendix of the third edition, the late Dean Burgon\r\ncontinued his work in this direction by adding a list of some three\r\nhundred and seventy-four cursives, besides the others with which he had\r\npreviously increased the number before known. That list, as was stated in\r\nthe Postscript to the Preface, awaited an examination and collation by\r\ncompetent persons. Such an examination has been made in many instances by\r\nDr. C. R. Gregory, who also, whether fired by Dean Burgon’s example as\r\nshown in his published letters in the _Guardian_ or not, has in his turn\r\nadded with most commendable diligence in research a very large number of\r\nMSS. previously unknown. Some more have been added in this edition, but\r\nmuch work is still required of scholars, before this mass of materials can\r\nbe used with effect by Textual students.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX TO CHAPTER III.

In some Evst. these are found at the end of\r\nthe book.\r\n\r\n(1) Matt. xxviii. 16-20. (2) Mark xvi. 1-8. (3) _ib._ 9-20. (4) Luke xxiv.\r\n1-12. (5) _ib._ 12-35. (6) _ib._ 36-53.

(11) _ib._ 15-25.\r\n\r\nWe have now traced the daily service of the Greek Church, as derived from\r\nthe Gospels, throughout the whole year, from Easter Day to Easter Even,\r\nonly that in Lent the lessons from the 2nd to the 6th days inclusive in\r\neach week are taken from the book of Genesis. The reader will observe that\r\nfrom Easter to Pentecost St. John and the Acts are read for seven weeks,\r\nor eight Sundays. The first Sunday after Pentecost is the Greek All\r\nSaints’ Day, their Trinity Sunday being virtually kept a fortnight\r\nearlier; but from the Monday next after the day of Pentecost (Whit-Monday)\r\nSt. Matthew is used continuously every day for eleven weeks and as many\r\nSundays. For six weeks more, St. Matthew is appointed for the Saturday and\r\nSunday lessons, St. Mark for the other days of the week. But inasmuch as\r\nSt. Luke was to be taken up with the new year, the year of the indiction\r\n[Arund. 547], which in this case must be September 24(105), if all the\r\nlessons in Matthew and Mark were not read out by this time (which, unless\r\nEaster was very early, would not be the case), they were at once broken\r\noff, and (after proper lessons had been employed for the Sunday before and\r\nthe Saturday and Sunday which followed(106) the feast of the Elevation of\r\nthe Cross, Sept. 14) the lessons from St. Luke (seventeen weeks and\r\nsixteen Sundays in all) were taken up and read on as far as was necessary:\r\nonly that the 17th Sunday of St. Matthew (called from the subject of its\r\nGospel _the Canaanitess_) was always resumed on the Sunday preceding that\r\nbefore the Carnival (πρὸ τῆς ἀποκρέω), which is also named from its Gospel\r\nthat of _the Prodigal_, and answers to the Latin _Septuagesima_. Then\r\nfollow the Sunday of the Carnival (ἀποκρέω) or _Sexagesima_, that of the\r\n_Cheese-eater_ (τυροφάγου) or _Quinquagesima_, and the six Sundays in\r\nLent. The whole number of Sunday Gospels in the year (even reckoning the\r\ntwo interpolated about September 14) is thus only fifty-three, the\r\n_Canaanitess_ coming twice over: but in the Menology or Catalogue of\r\nimmoveable feasts will be found proper lessons for three Saturdays and\r\nSundays about Christmas and Epiphany, which could either be substituted\r\nfor, or added to the ordinary Gospels for the year, according as the\r\ndistance from Easter in one year to Easter in the next exceeded or fell\r\nshort of fifty-two weeks. The system of lessons from the Acts and Epistles\r\nis much simpler than that of the Gospels: it exhibits fifty-two Sundays in\r\nthe year, without any of the complicated arrangements of the other scheme.\r\nSince the Epistles from the Saturday of the 16th week after Pentecost to\r\nthe Sunday of the Prodigal could not be set (like the rest) by the side of\r\ntheir corresponding Gospels, they are given separately in the following\r\ntable(107).\r\n\r\nΚυριακῇ ιϛ´  2 Cor. vi. 1-10.\r\nσαββάτῳ ιζ´      1 Cor. xiv. 20-25.\r\nΚυριακῇ ιζ´      2 Cor. vi. 16-viii. 1\r\nσαββάτῳ ιε´      1 Cor. xv. 39-45.\r\nΚυριακῇ ιε´     2 Cor. ix. 6-11.\r\nσαββάτῳ ιθ´    1 Cor. xv. 58-xvi. 3.\r\nΚυριακῇ ιθ´     2 Cor. xi. 31-xii. 9.\r\nσαββάτῳ κ´      2 Cor. i. 8-11.\r\nΚυριακῇ κ´      Gal. i. 11-19.\r\nσαββάτῳ κα´     2 Cor. iii. 12-18.\r\nΚυριακῇ κα´     Gal. ii. 16-20.\r\nσαββάτῳ κβ´     2 Cor. v. 1-10 (1-4 in B-C.

Another\r\nedition appeared in 1851, also at Venice.\r\n\r\nFor a comparison of the Greek with the Coptic Calendar, see p. 77, note 2.\r\nFor the Menology in the Jerusalem Syriac Lectionary, see Vol. II, Chap. 1.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV. THE LARGER UNCIAL MANUSCRIPTS OF THE GREEK TESTAMENT.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe proceed to describe in detail the uncial manuscripts of the Greek\r\nTestament, arranged separately as copies of the Gospels, of the Acts and\r\nCatholic Epistles, of the Pauline Epistles, and of the Apocalypse. They\r\nare usually indicated by the capital letters of the English and Greek\r\nalphabets, and stand on the list not in the order of their relative value\r\nor antiquity, but mainly as they were applied from time to time to the\r\npurposes of Textual criticism.\r\n\r\nא (_Aleph_). CODEX SINAITICUS, now at St. Petersburg, the justly\r\ncelebrated copy which sometime ago for a quarter of a century attracted\r\ngeneral attention in the learned world. Tischendorf (Notitia Ed. Cod.\r\nSinaitici, pp. 5, 6) when travelling in 1844 under the patronage of his\r\nown sovereign, King Frederick Augustus of Saxony, picked out of a basket\r\nfull of papers destined to light the oven of the Convent of St. Catherine\r\non Mount Sinai, the forty-three leaves of the Septuagint which he\r\npublished in 1846 as the Codex Friderico-Augustanus (_see_ p. 32). These,\r\nof course, he easily got for the asking, but finding that further portions\r\nof the same codex (e.g. the whole of Isaiah and 1, 4 Maccabees) were\r\nextant, he rescued them from their probable fate, by enlightening the\r\nbrotherhood as to their value. He was permitted to copy one page of what\r\nyet remained, containing the end of Isaiah and the beginning of Jeremiah,\r\nwhich he afterwards published in the first volume of his “Monumenta Sacra\r\nInedita” (1855), pp. xxx. and 213-16; and he departed in the full hope\r\nthat he should be allowed to purchase the whole. But he had taught the\r\nmonks a sharp lesson, and neither then, nor on his subsequent visit in\r\n1853, could he gain any tidings of the leaves he had left behind;—he even\r\nseems to have concluded that they had been carried into Europe by some\r\nricher or more fortunate collector. At the beginning of 1859, after the\r\ncare of the seventh edition of his N. T. was happily over, he went for a\r\nthird time into the East, under the well-deserved patronage of the Emperor\r\nof Russia, the great protector of the Oriental Church; and the treasure\r\nwhich had been twice withdrawn from him as a private traveller, was now,\r\non the occasion of some chance conversation, spontaneously put into the\r\nhands of one sent from the champion and benefactor of the oppressed\r\nChurch. Tischendorf touchingly describes his surprise, his joy, his\r\nmidnight studies over the priceless volume (“_quippe dormire nefas\r\nvidebatur_”) on that memorable 4th of February, 1859. The rest was easy;\r\nhe was allowed to copy his prize at Cairo, and ultimately to bring it to\r\nEurope, as a tribute of duty and gratitude to the Emperor Alexander II. To\r\nthat monarch’s wise munificence both the larger edition (1862), and the\r\nsmaller of the New Testament only (1863), are mainly due.\r\n\r\nThe Codex Sinaiticus is 13-½ inches in length by 14-7/8 inches high, and\r\nconsists of 346-½ leaves of the same beautiful vellum as the Cod.\r\nFriderico-Augustanus which is really a part of it whereof 199 contain\r\nportions of the Septuagint version, 147-½ the whole New Testament,\r\nBarnabas’ Epistle, and a considerable fragment of Hermas’ Shepherd. It has\r\nsubsequently appeared that the Russian Archimandrite (afterwards Bishop)\r\nPorphyry had brought with him from Sinai in 1845 some pieces of Genesis\r\nxxiii, xxiv, and of Numbers v, vi, and vii, which had been applied long\r\nbefore to the binding of other books(113). Each page comprises four\r\ncolumns (_see_ p. 27), with forty-eight lines in each column, of those\r\ncontinuous, noble, simple uncials (_compare_ Plate iv. 11 a _with_ 11 b).\r\nThe poetical books of the Old Testament, however, being written in στίχοι,\r\nadmit of only two columns on a page (_above_, p. 52). “In the Catholic\r\nEpistles the scribe has frequently contented himself with a column of\r\nforty-seven lines(114).” The order of the sacred books is remarkable,\r\nthough by no means unprecedented. St. Paul’s Epistles precede the Acts,\r\nand amongst them, that to the Hebrews follows 2 Thess., standing on the\r\nsame page with it (p. 74). Although this manuscript has hitherto been\r\ninspected by few Englishmen (Tregelles, however, and Dean Stanley were\r\namong the number), yet its general aspect has grown familiar to us by the\r\nmeans of photographs of its most important pages taken for the use of\r\nprivate scholars(115), as well as from the facsimiles contained in\r\nTischendorf’s several editions. Breathings and accents there are none\r\nexcept in Tobit vi. 9, and Gal. v. 21, as has been already mentioned: the\r\napostrophus and the single point for punctuation are entirely absent for\r\npages together, yet occasionally are rather thickly studded, not only in\r\nplaces where a later hand has been unusually busy (e.g. Isaiah i. 1-iii.\r\n2, two pages), but in some others (e.g. in 2 Cor. xii. 20 there are eight\r\nstops). Even words very usually abridged (except _θσ_, _κσ_, _ισ_, _χσ_,\r\n_πνα_ which are constant) are here written in full though the practice\r\nvaries, πατηρ, υιος, ουρανος, ανθρωπος, δαυειδ: we find ϊσραηλ´, ισλ or\r\n_ιηλ_: ϊερουσαλημ´, _ιημ_, _ιλμ_, _ιηλμ´_. Tischendorf considers the two\r\npoints over iota and upsilon (which are sometimes wanting) as seldom from\r\nthe first hand: the mark >, besides its rather rare marginal use in\r\ncitations (_see_ p. 64, note 4), we notice in the text oftener in the Old\r\nTestament than in the New. Words are divided at the end of a line: thus Κ\r\nin ΟΥΚ, and Χ in ΟΥΧ are separated(116). Small letters, of the most\r\nperfect shape, freely occur in all places, especially at the end of lines,\r\nwhere the _superscript_ (_see_ p. 50) is almost always made to represent Ν\r\n(e.g. seventeen times in Mark i. 1-35). Other _compendia scribendi_ are Κ\r\nfor και, and ΗΝ written as in Plate i. No. 2(117). Numerals are\r\nrepresented by letters, with a straight line placed over them, e.g. _μ_\r\nMark i. 13. Although there are no capitals, the initial letter of a line\r\nwhich begins a paragraph generally (not always) stands out from the rank\r\nof the rest, as in the Old Testament portion of Cod. Vaticanus, and less\r\nfrequently in the New, after the fashion of certain earlier pieces on\r\npapyrus. The titles and subscriptions of the several books are as short as\r\npossible (_see_ p. 65). The τίτλοι or κεφάλαια _majora_ are absent; the\r\nmargin contains the so-called Ammonian sections and Eusebian canons, but\r\nTischendorf is positive that neither they nor such notes as στιχων _ρπ_\r\n(_see_ p. 53, note 3) appended to 2 Thessalonians, are by the original\r\nscribe, although they may possibly be due to a contemporary hand. From the\r\nnumber of ὁμοιοτέλευτα and other errors, one cannot affirm that it is very\r\ncarefully written. Its itacisms are of the oldest type, and those not\r\nconstant; chiefly ι for ει, and δε and ε, and much more rarely η and υ and\r\nοι interchanged. The grammatical forms commonly termed Alexandrian occur,\r\npretty much as in other manuscripts of the earliest date. The whole\r\nmanuscript is disfigured by corrections, a few by the original scribe, or\r\nby the usual comparer or διορθώτης (_see_ p. 55); very many by an ancient\r\nand elegant hand of the sixth century (אa), whose emendations are of great\r\nimportance; some again by a hand but little later (אb); far the greatest\r\nnumber by a scholar of the seventh century (אc), who often cancels the\r\nchanges introduced by (אa); others by as many as eight several later\r\nwriters, whose varying styles Tischendorf has carefully discriminated and\r\nillustrated by facsimiles(118).\r\n\r\nThe foregoing considerations were bringing even cautious students to a\r\ngeneral conviction that Cod. א, if not, as its enthusiastic discoverer had\r\nannounced, “omnium antiquissimus” in the absolute sense of the words, was\r\nyet but little lower in date than the Vatican manuscript itself, and a\r\nveritable relic of the middle of the fourth century—the presence in its\r\nmargin of the sections and canons of Eusebius [d. 340?], by a hand nearly\r\nif not quite contemporaneous, seems to preclude the notion of higher\r\nantiquity(119)—when Constantino Simonides, a Greek of Syme, who had just\r\nedited a few papyrus fragments of the New Testament alleged to have been\r\nwritten in the first century of the Christian era, suddenly astonished the\r\nlearned world in 1862 by claiming to be himself the scribe who had penned\r\nthis manuscript in the monastery of Panteleemon on Mount Athos, as\r\nrecently as in the years 1839 and 1840. The writer of these pages must\r\nrefer to the Introduction to his Collation of the Codex Sinaiticus (pp.\r\nlx-lxxii, 2nd edition, 1867) for a statement of the reasons which have\r\nbeen universally accepted as conclusive, why the manuscript which\r\nSimonides may very well have written under the circumstances he has\r\ndescribed neither was nor possibly could be that venerable document. The\r\ndiscussion of the whole question, however, though painful enough in some\r\naspects, was the means of directing attention to certain peculiarities of\r\nCod. א which might otherwise have been overlooked. While engaged in\r\ndemonstrating that it could not have been transcribed from a\r\nMoscow-printed Bible, as was “Cod. Simoneidos” (to borrow the designation\r\nemployed by its author), critics came to perceive that either this copy or\r\nits immediate prototype must have been derived from a papyrus exemplar,\r\nand that probably of Egyptian origin (Collation, &c. pp. viii; xiv;\r\nlxviii), a confirmation of the impression conveyed to the reader by a\r\nfirst glance at the eight narrow columns of each open leaf (p. 28). The\r\nclaim of Simonides to be the sole writer of a book which must have\r\nconsisted when complete of about 730 leaves, or 1460 pages of very large\r\nsize (Collation, &c. p. xxxii), and that too within the compass of eight\r\nor ten months(120) (he inscribed on his finished work, as he tells us, the\r\nwords Σιμωνίδου τὸ ὅλον ἔργον), made it important to scrutinize the\r\ngrounds of Tischendorf’s judgement that four several scribes had been\r\nengaged upon it, one of whom, as he afterwards came to persuade himself,\r\nwas the writer of its rival, Codex Vaticanus(121). Such an investigation,\r\nso far as it depends only on the handwriting, can scarcely be carried out\r\nsatisfactorily without actual examination of the manuscript itself, which\r\nis unfortunately not easily within the reach of those who could use it\r\nindependently; but it is at all events quite plain, as well from internal\r\nconsiderations as from minute peculiarities in the writing, such as the\r\nfrequent use of the apostrophus and of the mark > (_see above_, p. 50) on\r\nsome sheets and their complete absence from others (Collation, &c. pp.\r\nxvi-xviii; xxxii; xxxvii), that at least two, and probably more, persons\r\nhave been employed on the several parts of the volume(122).\r\n\r\nIt is indeed a strange coincidence, although unquestionably it can be\r\nnothing more, that Simonides should have brought to the West from Mount\r\nAthos some years before one genuine fragment of the Shepherd of Hermas in\r\nGreek, and the transcript of a second (both of which materially aided\r\nTischendorf in editing the remains of that Apostolic Father), when taken\r\nin connexion with the fact that the worth of Codex Sinaiticus is vastly\r\nenhanced by its exhibiting next to the Apocalypse, and on the same page\r\nwith its conclusion, the only complete extant copy, besides the one\r\ndiscovered by Bryennios in 1875, of the Epistle of Barnabas in Greek,\r\nfollowed by a considerable portion of this self-same Shepherd of Hermas,\r\nmuch of which, as well as of Barnabas, was previously known to us only in\r\nthe Old Latin translation. Both these works are included in the list of\r\nbooks of the New Testament contained in the great Codex Claromontanus D of\r\nSt. Paul’s Epistles, to be described hereafter, Barnabas standing there in\r\nan order sufficiently remarkable; and their presence, like that of the\r\nEpistles of Clement at the end of Codex Alexandrinus (p. 99), brings us\r\nback to a time when the Church had not yet laid aside the primitive custom\r\nof reading publicly in the congregation certain venerated writings which\r\nhave never been regarded exactly in the same light as Holy Scripture\r\nitself. Between the end of Barnabas and the opening of the Shepherd are\r\nlost the last six leaves of a quaternion (which usually consists of eight)\r\nnumbered 91 at its head in a fairly ancient hand. The limited space would\r\nnot suffice for the insertion of Clement’s genuine Epistle, since the head\r\nof the next quaternion is numbered 92, but might suit one of the other\r\nuncanonical books on the list in Cod. Claromontanus, viz. the Acts of Paul\r\nand the Revelation of Peter.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the deeply interesting question as to the critical\r\ncharacter of Cod. א, although it strongly supports the Codex Vaticanus in\r\nmany characteristic readings, yet it cannot be said to give its exclusive\r\nadherence to any of the witnesses hitherto examined. It so lends its grave\r\nauthority, now to one and now to another, as to convince us more than ever\r\nof the futility of seeking to derive the genuine text of the New Testament\r\nfrom any one copy, however ancient and, on the whole, trustworthy, when\r\nevidence of a wide and varied character is at hand.\r\n\r\nA. CODEX ALEXANDRINUS in the British Museum, where the open volume of the\r\nNew Testament is publicly shown in the Manuscript room. It was placed in\r\nthat Library on its formation in 1753, having previously belonged to the\r\nking’s private collection from the year 1628, when Cyril Lucar, Patriarch\r\nof Constantinople (whose crude attempts to reform the Eastern Church on\r\nthe model of Geneva ultimately provoked the untoward Synod of Bethlehem in\r\n1672(123)), sent this most precious document by our Ambassador in Turkey,\r\nSir Thomas Roe, as a truly royal gift to Charles I. An Arabic inscription,\r\nseveral centuries old, at the back of the Table of Contents on the first\r\nleaf of the manuscript, and translated into Latin in another hand, which\r\nMr. W. Aldis Wright recognizes as Bentley’s (Academy, April 17, 1875),\r\nstates that it was written by the hand of Thecla the Martyr(124). A recent\r\nLatin note on the first page of the first of two fly-leaves declares that\r\nit was given to the Patriarchal Chamber in the year of the Martyrs, 814\r\n[A.D. 1098]. Another, and apparently the earliest inscription, in an\r\nobscure Moorish-Arabic scrawl, set at the foot of the first page of\r\nGenesis, was thus translated for Baber by Professor Nicoll of Oxford,\r\n“Dicatus est Cellae Patriarchae in urbe munitâ Alexandriâ. Qui eum ex eâ\r\nextraxerit sit anathematizatus, vi avulsus. Athanasius humilis” (Cod.\r\nAlex. V.T., Prolegomena, p. xxvi, note 92). That the book was brought from\r\nAlexandria by Cyril (who had been Patriarch of that see from 1602 to 1621)\r\nneed not be disputed, although Wetstein, on the doubtful authority of\r\nMatthew Muttis of Cyprus, Cyril’s deacon, concludes that he procured it\r\nfrom Mount Athos. In the volume itself the Patriarch has written and\r\nsubscribed the following words: “Liber iste scripturae sacrae N. et V.\r\nTestamenti, prout ex traditione habemus, est scriptus manu Theclae,\r\nnobilis foeminae Aegyptiae, ante mile [sic] et trecentos annos circiter,\r\npaulò post Concilium Nicenum. Nomen Theclae in fine libri erat exaratum,\r\nsed extincto Christianismo in Aegypto a Mahometanis, et libri unà\r\nChristianorum in similem sunt reducti conditionem. Extinctum ergo est\r\nTheclae nomen et laceratum, sed memoria et traditio recens observat.”\r\nCyril seems to lean wholly on the Arabic inscription on the first leaf of\r\nthe volume: independent testimony he would appear to have received none.\r\n\r\nThis celebrated manuscript, the earliest of first-rate importance applied\r\nby scholars to the criticism of the text, and yielding in value to but one\r\nor two at the utmost, is now bound in four volumes, whereof three contain\r\nthe Septuagint version of the Old Testament almost complete(125), the\r\nfourth volume the New Testament with several lamentable defects. In St.\r\nMatthew’s Gospel some twenty-five leaves are wanting up to ch. xxv. 6\r\nἐξέρχεσθε, from John vi. 50 ἵνα to viii. 52 καὶ σύ(126) two leaves are\r\nlost, and three leaves from 2 Cor. iv. 13 ἐπίστευσα to xii. 6 ἐξ ἐμοῦ. All\r\nthe other books of the New Testament are here entire, the Catholic\r\nEpistles following the Acts, that to the Hebrews standing before the\r\nPastoral Epistles (_see above_, p. 74). After the Apocalypse we find what\r\nwas till very recently the only known extant copy of the first or genuine\r\nEpistle of Clement of Rome, and a small fragment of a second of suspected\r\nauthenticity, both in the same hand as the latter part of the New\r\nTestament. It would appear also that these two Epistles of Clement were\r\ndesigned to form a part of the volume of Scripture, for in the Table of\r\nContents exhibited on the first leaf of the manuscript under the head Η\r\nΚΑΙΝΗ ΔΙΑΘΗΚΗ, they are represented as immediately following the\r\nApocalypse: next is given the number of books, ΟΜΟΥ ΒΙΒΛΙΑ, the numerals\r\nbeing now illegible; and after this, as if distinct from Scripture, the\r\neighteen Psalms of Solomon. Such uncanonical works (ἰδιωτικοὶ ψαλμοὶ ...\r\nἀκανόνιστα βιβλία) were forbidden to be read in churches by the 59th canon\r\nof the Council of Laodicea (A.D. 363?); whose 60th canon, which seems to\r\nhave been added a little later, enumerates the books of the N. T. in the\r\nprecise order seen in Cod. A, only that the Apocalypse and Clement’s\r\nEpistles do not stand on the list.\r\n\r\nThis manuscript is in quarto, 12-¾ inches high and 10-¼ broad, and\r\nconsists of 773 leaves (of which 639 contain the Old Testament), each page\r\nbeing divided into two columns of fifty or fifty-one lines each, having\r\nabout twenty letters or upwards in a line. These letters are written\r\ncontinuously in uncial characters, without any space between the words,\r\nthe uncials being of an elegant yet simple form, in a firm and uniform\r\nhand, though in some places larger than in others. Specimens of both\r\nstyles may be seen in our facsimiles (Plate v, Nos. 12, 13)(127), the\r\nfirst, Gen. i. 1, 2, being written in vermilion, the second, Acts xx. 28,\r\nin the once black, but now yellowish-brown ink of the body of the Codex.\r\nThe punctuation, which no later hand has meddled with, consists merely of\r\na point placed at the end of a sentence, usually on a level with the top\r\nof the preceding letter, but not always; and a vacant space follows the\r\npoint at the end of a paragraph, the space being proportioned to the break\r\nin the sense. Capital letters of various sizes abound at the beginning of\r\nbooks and sections, not painted as in later copies, but written by the\r\noriginal scribe in common ink. As these capitals stand entirely outside\r\nthe column in the margin (excepting in such rare cases as Gen. i. 1), if\r\nthe section begins in the middle of a line, the capital is necessarily\r\npostponed till the beginning of the next line, whose first letter is\r\nalways the capital, even though it be in the middle of a word (_see_ p.\r\n51). Vermilion is freely used in the initial lines of books, and has stood\r\nthe test of time much better than the black ink: the first four lines of\r\neach column on the first page of Genesis are in this colour, accompanied\r\nwith the only breathings and accents in the manuscript (_see above_, pp.\r\n45, 46). The first line of St. Mark, the first three of St. Luke, the\r\nfirst verse of St. John, the opening of the Acts down to δι, and so on for\r\nother books, are in vermilion. At the end of each book are neat and unique\r\nornaments in the ink of the first hand: see especially those at the end of\r\nSt. Mark and the Acts. As we have before stated this codex is the earliest\r\nwhich has the κεφάλαια proper, the so-called Ammonian sections, and the\r\nEusebian canons complete. Lists of the κεφάλαια precede each Gospel,\r\nexcept the first, where they are lost. Their titles stand or have stood at\r\nthe top of the pages, but the binder has often ruthlessly cut them short,\r\nand committed other yet more serious mutilation at the edges. The places\r\nat which they begin are indicated throughout, and their numbers are\r\nmoreover set in the margin of Luke and John. The sections and Eusebian\r\ncanons are conspicuous in the margin, and at the beginning of each of\r\nthese sections a capital letter is found. The rest of the New Testament\r\nhas no division into κεφάλαια, as was usual in later times, but paragraphs\r\nand capitals occur as the sense requires.\r\n\r\nThe palaeographic reasons for assigning this manuscript to the beginning\r\nor middle of the fifth century (the date now very generally acquiesced in,\r\nthough it may be referred even to the end of the fourth century, and is\r\ncertainly not much later) depend in part on the general style of the\r\nwriting, which is at once firm, elegant and simple; partly on the\r\nformation of certain letters, in which respect it holds a middle place\r\nbetween copies of the fourth and sixth centuries. The reader will recall\r\nwhat we have already said (pp. 33-40) as to the shape of _alpha_, _delta_,\r\n_epsilon_, _pi_, _sigma_, _phi_, and _omega_ in the Codex Alexandrinus.\r\nWoide, who edited the New Testament, believes that two hands were employed\r\nin that volume, changing in the page containing 1 Cor. v-vii, the vellum\r\nof the latter portion being thinner and the ink more thick, so that it has\r\npeeled off or eaten through the vellum in many places. This, however, is a\r\npoint on which those who know manuscripts best will most hesitate to speak\r\ndecidedly(128).\r\n\r\nThe external arguments for fixing the date are less weighty, but all point\r\nto the same conclusion. On the evidence for its being written by St.\r\nThecla, indeed, no one has cared to lay much stress, though some have\r\nthought that the scribe might belong to a monastery dedicated to that holy\r\nmartyr(129), whether the contemporary of St. Paul be meant, or her\r\nnamesake who suffered in the second year of Diocletian, A.D. 286 (Eusebius\r\nde Martyr. Palaestin. c. iii). Tregelles explains the origin of the Arabic\r\ninscription, on which Cyril’s statement appears to rest, by remarking that\r\nthe New Testament in our manuscript at present commences with Matt. xxv.\r\n6, this lesson (Matt. xxv. 1-13) _being that appointed by the Greek Church\r\nfor the festival of St. Thecla_ (_see above_, Menology, p. 87, Sept. 24).\r\nThus the Egyptian who wrote this Arabic note, observing the name of Thecla\r\nin the now mutilated upper margin of the Codex, where such rubrical notes\r\nare commonly placed by later hands, may have hastily concluded that she\r\nwrote the book, and so perplexed our Biblical critics. It seems a fatal\r\nobjection to this shrewd conjecture, as Mr. E. Maunde Thompson points out,\r\nthat the Arabic numeration of the leaf, set in the _verso_ of the lower\r\nmargin, itself posterior in date to the Arabic note relating to Thecla, is\r\n26(130); so that the twenty-five leaves now lost must have been still\r\nextant when that note was written.\r\n\r\nOther more trustworthy reasons for assigning Cod. A to the fifth century\r\nmay be summed up very briefly. The presence of the canons of Eusebius\r\n[A.D. 268-340?], and of the epistle to Marcellinus by the great\r\nAthanasius, Patriarch of Alexandria [300?-373], standing before the\r\nPsalms, place a limit in one direction, while the absence of the Euthalian\r\ndivisions of the Acts and Epistles (_see above_, p. 64), which came into\r\nvogue very soon after A.D. 458, and the shortness of the ὑπογραφαί\r\n(_above_, p. 65), appear tolerably decisive against a later date than A.D.\r\n450. The insertion of the Epistles of Clement, like that of the treatises\r\nof Barnabas and Hermas in the Cod. Sinaiticus (p. 92), recalls us to a\r\nperiod when the canon of Scripture was in some particulars a little\r\nunsettled, that is, about the age of the Councils of Laodicea (363?) and\r\nof Carthage (397). Other arguments have been urged both for an earlier and\r\na later date, but they scarcely deserve discussion. Wetstein’s objection\r\nto the name Θεοτόκος as applied to the Blessed Virgin in the title to her\r\nsong, added to the Psalms, is quite groundless: that appellation was given\r\nto her by both the Gregories in the middle of the fourth century (_vid._\r\nSuicer, Thesaur. Eccles. i. p. 1387), as habitually as it was a century\r\nafter: nor should we insist much on the contrary upon Woide’s or Schulz’s\r\npersuasion that the τρισάγιον (ἅγιος ὁ θεός, ἅγιος ἰσχυρός, ἅγιος\r\nἀθάνατος) would have been found in the ὕμνος ἑωθινός after the Psalms, had\r\nthe manuscript been written as late as the fifth century.\r\n\r\nPartial and inaccurate collations of the New Testament portion of this\r\nmanuscript were made by Patrick Young, Librarian to Charles I(131), who\r\nfirst published from it the Epistles of Clement in 1633: then by Alexander\r\nHuish, Prebendary of Wells, for Walton’s Polyglott, and by some\r\nothers(132). The Old Testament portion was edited in 1707-20, after a not\r\nvery happy plan, but with learned Prolegomena and notes, by the Prussian\r\nJ. E. Grabe, the second and third of his four volumes being posthumous.\r\n\r\nIn 1786, Charles Godfrey Woide, preacher at the Dutch Chapel Royal and\r\nAssistant Librarian in the British Museum, a distinguished Coptic scholar\r\n[d. 1790], published, by the aid of 456 subscribers, a noble folio edition\r\nof the New Testament from this manuscript, with valuable Prolegomena, a\r\ncopy of the text which, so far as it has been tested, has been found\r\nreasonably accurate, together with notes on the changes made in the codex\r\nby later hands, and a minute collation of its readings with the common\r\ntext as presented in Kuster’s edition of Mill’s N. T. (1710). In this last\r\npoint Woide has not been taken as a model by subsequent editors of\r\nmanuscripts, much to the inconvenience of the student. In 1816-28 the Old\r\nTestament portion of the Codex Alexandrinus was published in three folio\r\nvolumes at the national expense, by the Rev. Henry Hervey Baber, also of\r\nthe British Museum, the Prolegomena to whose magnificent work are very\r\ninferior to Woide’s, but contain some additional information. Both these\r\nperformances, and many others like them which we shall have to describe,\r\nare printed in an uncial type, bearing some general resemblance to that of\r\ntheir respective originals, but which must not be supposed to convey any\r\nadequate notion of their actual appearance. Such quasi-facsimiles (for\r\nthey are nothing more), while they add to the cost of the book, seem to\r\nanswer no useful purpose whatever; and, if taken by an incautious reader\r\nfor more than they profess to be, will seriously mislead him. In 1860 Mr.\r\nB. H. Cowper put forth an octavo edition of the New Testament pages in\r\ncommon type, but burdened with modern breathings and accents, the lacunae\r\nof the manuscript being unwisely supplied by means of Kuster’s edition of\r\nMill, and the original paragraphs departed from, wheresoever they were\r\njudged to be inconvenient. These obvious faults are the more to be\r\nregretted, inasmuch as Mr. Cowper has not shrunk from the labour of\r\nrevising Woide’s edition by a comparison with the Codex itself, thus\r\ngiving to his book a distinctive value of its own. An admirable autotype\r\nfacsimile of the New Testament was published in 1879, and afterwards of\r\nthe Old Testament, by Mr. E. Maunde Thompson, then the Principal Keeper of\r\nManuscripts, now the Principal Librarian, of the British Museum.\r\n\r\nThe Codex Alexandrinus has been judged to be carelessly written; many\r\nerrors of transcription no doubt exist, but not so many as in some copies\r\n(e.g. Cod. א), nor more than in others (as Cod. B). None other than the\r\nordinary abridgements are found in it (_see_ pp. 49-50): numerals are not\r\nexpressed by letters except in Apoc. vii. 4; xxi. 17: ι and υ have usually\r\nthe dots over them at the beginning of a syllable. Of itacisms it may be\r\ndoubted whether it contains more than others of the same date: the\r\ninterchange of ι and ει, η and ι, ε, αι, are the most frequent; but these\r\nmutations are too common to prove anything touching the country of the\r\nmanuscript. Its external history renders it very likely that it was\r\nwritten at Alexandria, that great manufactory of correct and elegant\r\ncopies, while Egypt was yet a Christian land: but such forms as λήμψομαι,\r\nἐλάβαμεν, ἦλθαν, ἔνατος, ἐκαθερίσθη, and others named by Woide, are\r\npeculiar to no single nation, but are found repeatedly in Greek-Latin\r\ncodices which unquestionably originated in Western Europe. This manuscript\r\nis of the very greatest importance to the critic, inasmuch as it exhibits\r\n(especially in the Gospels) a text more nearly approaching that found in\r\nlater copies than is read in others of its high antiquity, although some\r\nof its errors are portentous enough, e.g. θ_υ_ for _ιυ_ in John xix. 40.\r\nThis topic, however, will be discussed at length in another place, and we\r\nshall elsewhere consider the testimony Codex A bears in the celebrated\r\npassage 1 Tim. iii. 16.\r\n\r\nB. CODEX VATICANUS 1209 is probably the oldest large vellum manuscript in\r\nexistence, and is the glory of the great Vatican Library at Rome. To this\r\nlegitimate source of deep interest must be added the almost romantic\r\ncuriosity which was once excited by the jealous watchfulness of its\r\nofficial guardians. But now that an acquaintance with it has been placed\r\nwithin the reach of scholars through the magnificent autotype edition\r\nissued by the authorities of the Vatican, it may be hoped that all such\r\nmystic glamour will soon be left with the past. This book seems to have\r\nbeen brought into the Vatican Library shortly after its establishment by\r\nPope Nicolas V in 1448, but nothing is known of its previous history(133).\r\nIt is entered in the earliest catalogue of that Library, made in 1475.\r\nSince the missing portions at the end of the New Testament are believed to\r\nhave been supplied in the fifteenth century from a manuscript belonging to\r\nCardinal Bessarion, we may be allowed to conjecture, if we please, that\r\nthis learned Greek brought the Codex into the west of Europe. It was taken\r\nto Paris by Napoleon I, where it was studied by Hug in 1809. Although this\r\nbook has not even yet been as thoroughly collated, or rendered as\r\navailable as it might be to the critical student, its general character\r\nand appearance are sufficiently well known. It is a quarto volume,\r\narranged in quires of five sheets or ten leaves each, like Codex\r\nMarchalianus of the Prophets written in the sixth or seventh century and\r\nCod. Rossanensis of the Gospels to be described hereafter, not of four or\r\nthree sheets as Cod. א, the ancient, perhaps the original, numbering of\r\nthe quires being often found in the margin. The New Testament fills 142\r\nout of its 759 thin and delicate vellum leaves, said to be made of the\r\nskins of antelopes: it is bound in red morocco, being 10-½ inches high, 10\r\nbroad, 4-½ thick. It once contained the whole Bible in Greek, the Old\r\nTestament of the Septuagint version (a tolerably fair representation of\r\nwhich was exhibited in the Roman edition as early as 1587(134)), except\r\nthe books of the Maccabees and the Prayer of Manasses. The first forty-six\r\nchapters of Genesis (the manuscript begins at πολιν, Gen. xlvi. 28) and\r\nPsalms cv-cxxxvii, also the books of the Maccabees, are wanting. The New\r\nTestament is complete down to Heb. ix. 14 καθα: the rest of the Epistle to\r\nthe Hebrews (the Catholic Epistles had followed the Acts, _see_ p. 74),\r\nand the Apocalypse, being written in the later hand alluded to above. The\r\npeculiar arrangement of three columns on a page, or six on the opened leaf\r\nof the volume, is described by eye-witnesses as very striking: in the\r\npoetical books of the Old Testament (since they are written στιχηρῶς) only\r\ntwo columns fill a page. Our facsimile (Plate viii, No. 20) comprises Mark\r\nxvi. 3 μιν τον λιθον to the end of verse 8, where the Gospel ends\r\nabruptly; both the arabesque ornament and the subscription ΚΑΤΑ ΜΑΡΚΟΝ\r\nbeing in a later hand (for M _see_ p. 37). All who have inspected the\r\nCodex are loud in their praises of the fine thin vellum, the clear and\r\nelegant hand of the first penman, the simplicity of the whole style of the\r\nwork: capital letters, so frequent in the Codex Alexandrinus, were totally\r\nwanting in this document for some centuries. In several of these\r\nparticulars our manuscript resembles the Herculanean rolls, and thus\r\nasserts a just claim to high antiquity, which the absence of the divisions\r\ninto κεφάλαια, of the sections and canons, and the substitution in their\r\nroom of another scheme of chapters of its own (described above, p. 56),\r\nbeyond question tend very powerfully to confirm. Each column contains\r\nordinarily forty-two lines(135), each line from sixteen to eighteen\r\nletters, of a size somewhat less than in Cod. A, much less than in Cod. א\r\n(though they all vary a little in this respect), with no intervals between\r\nwords, a space of the breadth of half a letter being left at the end of a\r\nsentence, and a little more at the conclusion of a paragraph; the first\r\nletter of the new sentence occasionally standing a little out of the line\r\n(_see_ pp. 51, 93). It has been doubted whether any of the stops are\r\n_primâ manu_, and (contrary to the judgement of Birch and others) the\r\nbreathings and accents are now universally allowed to have been added by a\r\nlater hand. This hand, referred by some to the eighth century (although\r\nTischendorf, with Dr. Hort’s approval, assigns it to the tenth or\r\neleventh(136)), retraced, with as much care as such an operation would\r\npermit, the faint lines of the original writing (the ink whereof was\r\nperhaps never quite black), the remains of which can even now be seen by a\r\nkeen-sighted reader by the side of the thicker and more modern strokes;\r\nand, anxious at the same time to represent a critical revision of the\r\ntext, the writer left untouched such words or letters as he wished to\r\nreject. In these last places, _where no breathings or accents and scarcely\r\nany stops_(137)_ have ever been detected_, we have an opportunity of\r\nseeing the manuscript in its primitive condition, before it had been\r\ntampered with by the later scribe. There are occasional breaks in the\r\ncontinuity of the writing, every descent in the genealogies of our Lord\r\n(Matt. i, Luke iii(138)), each of the beatitudes (Matt. v), of the\r\nparables in Matt. xiii, and the salutations of Rom. xvi, forming a\r\nseparate paragraph; but such a case will oftentimes not occur for several\r\nconsecutive pages. The writer’s plan was to proceed regularly with a book\r\nuntil it was finished: then to break off from the column he was writing,\r\nand to begin the next book on the very next column. Thus only _one_ column\r\nperfectly blank is found in the whole New Testament(139), that which\r\nfollows ἐφοβοῦντο γάρ in Mark xvi. 8: and since Cod. B is the only one yet\r\nknown, except Cod. א, that actually omits the last twelve verses of that\r\nGospel, by leaving such a space the scribe has intimated that he was fully\r\naware of their existence, or even found them in the copy from which he\r\nwrote. The capital letters at the beginning of each book are likewise due\r\nto the corrector, who sometimes erased, sometimes merely touched slightly,\r\nthe original initial letter, which (as in the Herculanean rolls) is no\r\nlarger than any other. The _paragraph_ marks (usually straight lines, but\r\nsometimes [symbol](140)) are seen quite frequently in some parts; whether\r\nfrom the first hand is very doubtful. The note of citation > is perpetual,\r\nnot occasional as in Cod. א. Fewer abridgements than usual occur in this\r\nvenerable copy. The formation of _delta_, _pi_, _chi_; the loop-like curve\r\non the left side of _alpha_; the absence of points at the extremities of\r\n_sigma_ or _epsilon_; the length and size of _rho_, _upsilon_, _phi_, all\r\npoint to the FOURTH century as the date of this manuscript. The smaller\r\nletters so often found at the end of lines preserve the same firm and\r\nsimple character as the rest; of the use of the apostrophus, so frequent\r\nin Codd. א, A and some others, Tischendorf enumerates ten instances in the\r\nNew Testament (N. T. Vatican. Proleg. p. xxi), whereof four are\r\nrepresented in the Roman edition of 1868, with two more which Tischendorf\r\nconsiders as simple points (Acts vii. 13, 14).\r\n\r\nTischendorf says truly enough that something like a history might be\r\nwritten of the futile attempts to collate Cod. B, and a very unprofitable\r\nhistory it would be. The manuscript is first distinctly heard of (for it\r\ndoes not appear to have been used for the Complutensian Polyglott(141))\r\nthrough Sepulveda, to whose correspondence with Erasmus attention has been\r\nseasonably recalled by Tregelles. Writing in 1533, he says, “Est enim\r\nGraecum exemplar antiquissimum in Bibliothecâ Vaticanâ, in quo\r\ndiligentissimè et accuratissimè literis majusculis conscriptum utrumque\r\nTestamentum continetur longè diversum a vulgatis exemplaribus”: and, after\r\nnoticing as a weighty proof of excellence its agreement with the Latin\r\nversion (multum convenit cum vetere nostrâ translatione) against the\r\ncommon Greek text (vulgatam Graecorum editionem), he furnishes Erasmus\r\nwith 365 readings as a convincing argument in support of his statements.\r\nIt would probably be from this list that in his Annotations to the Acts,\r\npublished in 1535, Erasmus cites the reading καῦδα, ch. xxvii. 16 (“quidam\r\nadmonent” is the expression he uses), from a Greek codex in the Pontifical\r\nLibrary, since for this reading Cod. B is the only known _Greek_ witness,\r\nexcept a corrector of Cod. א. It seems, however, that he had obtained some\r\naccount of this manuscript from the Papal Librarian Paul Bombasius as\r\nearly as 1521 (_see_ Wetstein’s Proleg. N. T., vol. i. p. 23). Lucas\r\nBrugensis, who published his Notationes in S. Biblia in 1580, and his\r\nCommentary on the Four Gospels (dedicated to Cardinal Bellarmine) in 1606,\r\nmade known some twenty extracts from Cod. B taken by Werner of Nimeguen;\r\nthat most imperfect collection being the only source from which Mill and\r\neven Wetstein had any acquaintance with the contents of this first-rate\r\ndocument. More indeed might have been gleaned from the Barberini readings\r\ngathered in or about 1625 (of which we shall speak in the next section),\r\nbut their real value and character were not known in the lifetime of\r\nWetstein. In 1698 Lorenzo Alexander Zacagni, Librarian of the Vatican, in\r\nhis Preface to the Collectanea Monumentorum Veterum Eccles., describes\r\nCod. B, and especially its peculiar division into sections, in a passage\r\ncited by Mill (Proleg. § 1480). In 1669 indeed the first real collation of\r\nthe manuscript with the Aldine edition (1518) had been attempted by\r\nBartolocci, then Librarian of the Vatican; from some accident, however, it\r\nwas never published, though a transcript under the feigned name of Giulio\r\na Sta. Anastasia yet remains in the Imperial Library of Paris (MSS. Gr.\r\nSupplem. 53), where it was first discovered and used by Scholz in 1819,\r\nand subsequently by Tischendorf and Muralt, the latter of whom (apparently\r\non but slender grounds) regards it as the best hitherto made; others have\r\ndeclared it to be very imperfect, and quite inferior to those of Bentley\r\nand Birch. The collation which bears Bentley’s name (Trin. Coll. B. xvii.\r\n3, in Cephalaeus’ N. T. 1524) was procured about 1720 by his money and the\r\nlabour of the Abbate Mico, for the purpose of his projected Greek\r\nTestament. When he had found out its defects, by means of an examination\r\nof the original by his nephew Thomas Bentley in 1726, our great critic\r\nengaged the Abbate Rulotta in 1729 for forty scudi (Bentley’s\r\nCorrespondence, p. 706) to revise Mico’s sheets, and especially to note\r\nthe changes made by the second hand. Rulotta’s papers came to light in\r\n1855 among the Bentley manuscripts in the Library of Trinity College,\r\nCambridge (B. xvii. 20), and have lately proved of signal value(142);\r\nMico’s were published in 1799 at Oxford, by Henry Ford, Lord Almoner’s\r\nReader in Arabic there (1783-1813), together with some Thebaic fragments\r\nof the New Testament, in a volume which (since it was chiefly drawn from\r\nWoide’s posthumous papers) he was pleased to call an Appendix to the Codex\r\nAlexandrinus. A fourth collation of the Vatican MS. was made about 1780 by\r\nAndrew Birch of Copenhagen, and is included in the notes to the first\r\nvolume of his Greek Testament 1788, or published separately in three\r\nvolumes which were issued successively 1798 (Acts, Cath. Epp., Paul.),\r\n1800 (Apoc.), and 1801 (Evans). Birch’s collation does not extend to the\r\nGospels of St. Luke and St. John, and on the whole is less full and exact\r\nthan Mico’s. In 1810, however, when, with the other best treasures of the\r\nVatican, Codex B was at Paris, the celebrated critic J. L. Hug sent forth\r\nhis treatise “de Antiquitate Vaticani Codicis Commentatio,” and though\r\neven he did not perceive the need of a new and full collation when he\r\nexamined it in 1809, he has the merit of first placing it in the paramount\r\nrank it still holds as one of the oldest and most venerable of extant\r\nmonuments of sacred antiquity. His conclusion respecting its date, that it\r\nis not later than the middle of the fourth century, has been acquiesced in\r\nwith little opposition, though Tischendorf declares rather pithily that he\r\nholds this belief “non propter Hugium sed cum Hugio” (Cod. Ephraem.\r\nProleg. p. 19). Some of his reasons, no doubt, are weak enough(143); but\r\nthe strength of his position depends on an accumulation of minute\r\nparticulars, against which there seems nothing to set up which would\r\nsuggest a lower period. On its return to Rome, this volume was no longer\r\navailable for the free use and reference of critics. In 1843 Tischendorf,\r\nafter long and anxious expectation during a visit to Rome that lasted some\r\nmonths, obtained a sight of it for two days of three hours each(144). In\r\n1844 Edward de Muralt was admitted to the higher privilege of three days\r\nor nine hours enjoyment of this treasure, and on the strength of the\r\nfavour published an edition of the New Testament, _ad fidem codicis\r\nprincipis Vaticani_, in 1846. Tregelles, who went to Rome in 1845 for the\r\nspecial purpose of consulting it, was treated even worse. He had forearmed\r\nhimself (as he fondly imagined) with recommendatory letters from Cardinal\r\nWiseman, and was often allowed to _see_ the manuscript, but hindered from\r\ntranscribing any of its readings(145).\r\n\r\nWhat the Papal authorities would not entrust to others, they had at least\r\nthe merit of attempting and at length accomplishing themselves. As early\r\nas 1836 Bishop Wiseman announced in his Lectures on the Connection between\r\nScience and Revelation, vol. ii. pp. 187-191, that Cardinal Mai, whose\r\nservices to classical and ecclesiastical literature were renowned\r\nthroughout Europe, was engaged on an edition of the Codex Vaticanus,\r\ncommenced under the immediate sanction of Pope Leo XII (1823-29). As years\r\npassed by and no such work appeared, adverse reports and evil surmises\r\nbegan to take the place of hope, although the Cardinal often spoke of his\r\nwork as already finished, only that he desired to write full Prolegomena\r\nbefore it should appear. In September 1854 he died, honoured and ripe in\r\nyears; and at length, when no more seemed to be looked for in that\r\nquarter, five quarto volumes issued from the Roman press in 1857, the New\r\nTestament comprising the fifth volume, with a slight and meagre preface by\r\nthe Cardinal, and a letter to the reader by “Carolus Vercellone, Sodalis\r\nBarnabites,” which told in a few frank manly words how little accuracy we\r\nhad to expect in a work, by the publication of which he still persuaded\r\nhimself he was decorating Mai’s memory “novâ usque gloriâ atque\r\nsplendidiore coronâ” (tom. i. p. iii). The cause of that long delay now\r\nrequired no explanation. In fact so long as Mai lived the edition never\r\nwould have appeared; for though he had not patience or special skill\r\nenough to accomplish his task well, he was too good a scholar not to know\r\nthat he had done it very ill. The text is broken up into paragraphs, the\r\nnumbers of the modern chapters and verses being placed in the margin; the\r\npeculiar divisions of the Codex Vaticanus (_see_ p. 56) sometimes omitted,\r\nsometimes tampered with. The Greek type employed is not an imitation of\r\nthe uncials in the manuscript (of which circumstance we do not complain),\r\nbut has modern stops, breathings, accents, ι _subscript_, &c., as if the\r\nvenerable document were written yesterday. As regards the orthography it\r\nis partially, and only partially, modernized; clauses or whole passages\r\nomitted in the manuscript are supplied from other sources, although the\r\nfact is duly notified(146); sometimes the readings of the first hand are\r\nput in the margin, while those of the second stand in the text, sometimes\r\nthe contrary: in a word, the plan of the work exhibits all the faults such\r\na performance well can have. Nor is the execution at all less\r\nobjectionable. Although the five volumes were ten years in printing\r\n(1828-38), Mai devoted to their superintendence only his scanty spare\r\nhours, and even then worked so carelessly that after cancelling a hundred\r\npages for their incurable want of exactness, he was reduced to the shift\r\nof making _manual_ corrections with moveable types, and projected huge\r\ntables of errata, which Vercellone has in some measure tried to supply.\r\nWhen once it is stated that the type was set up from the common Elzevir or\r\nfrom some other printed Greek Testament, the readings of the Codex itself\r\nbeing inserted as corrections, and the whole revised by means of an\r\nassistant who read the proof-sheets to the Cardinal while he inspected the\r\nmanuscript; no one will look for accuracy from a method which could not\r\npossibly lead to it. Accordingly, when Mai’s text came to be compared with\r\nthe collations of Bartolocci, of Mico, of Rulotta, and of Birch, or with\r\nthe scattered readings which had been extracted by others, it was soon\r\ndiscovered that while this edition added very considerably to our\r\nknowledge of the Codex Vaticanus, and often enabled us to form a decision\r\non its readings when the others were at variance; it was in its turn\r\nconvicted by them of so many errors, oversights, and inconsistencies, that\r\nits single evidence could never be used with confidence, especially when\r\nit agreed with the commonly received Greek text. Immediately after the\r\nappearance of Mai’s expensive quartos, an octavo reprint of the New\r\nTestament was struck off at Leipsic for certain London booksellers, which\r\nproved but a hasty, slovenly, unscholarlike performance, and was put aside\r\nin 1859 by a cheap Roman edition in octavo, prepared, as was the quarto,\r\nby Mai, prefaced by another graceful and sensible epistle of\r\nVercellone(147). This last edition was undertaken by the Cardinal, after\r\nsad experience had taught him the defects of his larger work, and he took\r\ngood care to avoid some of the worst of them: the readings of the second\r\nhand are usually, though not always, banished to the margin, their number\r\non the whole is increased, gross errors are corrected, omissions supplied,\r\nand the Vatican chapters are given faithfully and in full. But Mai’s whole\r\nprocedure in this matter is so truly unfortunate, that in a person whose\r\nfame was less solidly grounded, we should impute it to mere helpless\r\nincapacity(148). Not only did he split up the paragraphs of his quarto\r\ninto the modern chapters and verses (in itself a most undesirable change,\r\n_see above_, p. 70), but by omitting some things and altering others, he\r\nintroduced almost as many errors as he removed. When Dean Burgon was\r\npermitted to examine the Codex for an hour and a half in 1860, on\r\nconsulting it for sixteen passages out of hundreds wherein the two are\r\nutterly at variance, he discovered that the quarto was right in seven of\r\nthem, the octavo in nine: as if Mai were determined that neither of his\r\neditions should supersede the use of the other. Dean Alford also collated\r\nnumerous passages in 1861(149), and his secretary Mr. Cure in 1862,\r\nespecially with reference to the several correcting hands: “in errorem\r\nquidem et ipse haud raro inductus,” is Tischendorf’s verdict on his\r\nlabours. Thus critics of every shade of opinion became unanimous on one\r\npoint, that a new edition of the Codex Vaticanus was as imperatively\r\nneeded as ever; one which should preserve with accuracy all that the first\r\nhand has written (transcriptural errors included), should note in every\r\ninstance the corrections made by the second hand, and, wherever any one of\r\nthe previous collators might be found in error, should expressly state the\r\ntrue reading.\r\n\r\nIt would have been a grievous reproach had no efforts been made to supply\r\nso great and acknowledged a want. Early in 1866, Tischendorf again visited\r\nRome, and when admitted into the presence of Pope Pius IX, boldly sought\r\npermission to edit at his own cost such an edition of Cod. B as he had\r\nalready published of Cod. א. The request was denied by his Holiness, who\r\nobscurely hinted his intention of carrying out the same design on his own\r\naccount. Tischendorf, however, obtained permission to use the manuscript\r\nso far as to consult it in such parts of the New Testament as presented\r\nany special difficulty, or respecting which previous collators were at\r\nvariance. He commenced his task February 28, and in the course of it could\r\nnot refrain from copying at length twenty pages of the great\r\nCodex—nineteen from the New Testament, and one from the Old. This licence\r\nwas not unnaturally regarded as a breach of his contract, so that, after\r\nhe had used the manuscript for eight days, it was abruptly withdrawn from\r\nhim on March 12. An appeal to the generosity of Vercellone, who had been\r\nentrusted with the care of the forthcoming edition, procured for him the\r\nsight of this coveted treasure for six days longer between March 20 and\r\n26, the Italian being always present on these latter occasions, and\r\nreceiving instruction for the preparation of his own work by watching the\r\nprocesses of a master hand. Thus fourteen days of three hours each, used\r\nzealously and skilfully, enabled Tischendorf to put forth an edition of\r\nCod. B far superior to any that preceded it(150). The Prolegomena are full\r\nof matter from which we have drawn freely in the foregoing description,\r\nthe text is in cursive type, the nineteen pages which cost him so dearly\r\nbeing arranged in their proper lines, the remainder according to columns.\r\nMuch that ought to have been noted was doubtless passed over by\r\nTischendorf for mere pressure of time; but he takes great pains to\r\ndistinguish the readings of the original writer or his διορθωτής (_see_ p.\r\n55)(151), both of whom supplied words or letters here and there in the\r\nmargin or between the lines(152), from the corrections of a second yet\r\nancient scribe (B2), and those of the person (B3) who retraced the faded\r\nwriting at a later period(153). One notion, taken up by Tischendorf in the\r\ncourse of his collation in 1866, was received at first with general\r\nincredulity by other scholars. He has pronounced a decided opinion, not\r\nonly that Codd. א and B are documents of the same age, but that the scribe\r\nwho wrote the latter is one of the four [D] to whose diligence we owe the\r\nformer. That there should be a general similarity in the style of the two\r\ngreat codices is probable enough, although the letters in Cod. א are about\r\nhalf as large again as those of its fellow, but such as are aware of the\r\ndifficulty of arriving at a safe conclusion as to identity of penmanship\r\nafter close and repeated comparison of one document with another, will\r\nhardly attach much weight to the impression of any person, however large\r\nhis experience, who has nothing but memory to trust to. Tregelles, who has\r\nalso seen both copies, states that Cod. א looks much the fresher and\r\nclearer of the two. Yet the reasons alleged above, which are quite\r\nindependent of the appearance of the handwriting, leave scarcely a doubt\r\nthat Tischendorf’s judgement was correct.\r\n\r\nThe Roman edition, projected by Vercellone and Cozza under the auspices of\r\nPius IX, was designed to consist of six volumes, four containing the Old\r\nTestament, one the New, another being devoted to the notes and\r\ndiscrimination of corrections by later hands. The New Testament appeared\r\nin 1868(154), a second volume in 1869, containing the text from Genesis to\r\nJoshua; three more have since completed the Old Testament (1870, 1871,\r\n1872). The learned, genial, and modest Vercellone (b. 1814) died early in\r\n1869, so that the later volumes bear on their title-page the mournful\r\ninscription “Carolum Vercellone excepit Caietanus Sergio Sodalis\r\nBarnabites” as Cozza’s associate. These editors fared but ill whether as\r\nBiblical critics or as general scholars, under the rough handling of\r\nTischendorf, whom the wiser policy of Vercellone had kept in good humour,\r\nbut whose powers his successors greatly undervalued. There seems, however,\r\nto be no great cause, in spite of their adversary’s minute diligence in\r\nfault-finding (Appendix N. T. Vatic. 1869, p. xi, &c.)(155), for doubting\r\ntheir general correctness, although they persist in placing on the page\r\nwith the rest of their text readings which are known or credibly stated to\r\nbe of decidedly later date, in spite of the incongruousness of the mixture\r\nof what was original with matter plainly adscititious(156). Thus in the\r\nRoman edition αδελφων μου των Matt. xxv. 40, imputed by Tischendorf to B2\r\nand B3, stands in the margin just in the same way as ο γαμος Matt. xxii.\r\n10, which he refers to the first hand. But this is only one instance of a\r\nlack of judgement which deforms every page of their performance: e.g.\r\nMatt. xix. 12; xxiii. 26; 37; xxv. 16; xxvii. 12; 13; 45; xxviii. 15; Acts\r\nxv. 1: all which places exhibit, undistinguished from emendations of the\r\noriginal scribe or his “corrector,” readings in the margin or between the\r\nlines which Tischendorf asserts to belong mostly to B3, a few to B2.(157)\r\n\r\nAt length, after baffling delays only too readily accounted for by the\r\npublic calamities of the Papal state, the concluding volume of this\r\nsumptuous and important work was published late in 1881. Sergius had now\r\nretired through failing eyesight, and his place was taken by “Henricus\r\nCanonicus Fabiani,” Cozza (who is now Abbot of the Grotta Ferrata at\r\nTusculum near Frascati, the chief seat of the monks of the Greek order of\r\nSt. Basil) still holding the second place. From the laudatory tone in\r\nwhich the latter is spoken of (p. xiv), it would seem that the Preface was\r\nwritten by his new colleague, who acknowledges the help of U. Ubaldi and\r\nthe Basilian monk Ant. Rocchi, all three “adjutoribus et administris\r\nmiratis equidem se tantis viris adjutores et successores datos” (p. xv).\r\nThis Preface consists of twenty-two pages, and contains almost nothing\r\nthat is interesting to the critic, much that displays superficial and\r\nnewly-acquired acquaintance with the whole subject. Fabiani assigns the\r\nend of the fourth century as the date of the manuscript, regarding it as\r\nonly a few years older than the Sinaitic copy(158), whose discovery he\r\nhails without a vestige of ungenerous jealousy: “Quorum tale est demum\r\npar, ut potius liber Vaticanus gaudere debeat quod tam sui similem\r\ninvenerit fratrem, quam expavescere quod aemulum” (p. viii). Since that\r\ntime a splendid edition has been issued of the New Testament in 1889, and\r\nthe Old in 1890, under the care of the Abbate Cozza-Luzi, in which the\r\nwhole is beautifully exhibited in photograph: so that all students can now\r\nexamine for themselves the readings and characteristics of this celebrated\r\nmanuscript with all but the advantage which is given in an examination of\r\nthe original vellum itself (Novum Testamentum e Codd. Vat. 1209, &c. Rom.\r\n1889, 4to): and gratitude is due from all textual scholars to the\r\nauthorities of the Vatican.\r\n\r\nThose who agree the most unreservedly respecting the age of the Codex\r\nVaticanus, vary widely in their estimate of its critical value. By some it\r\nhas been held in such undue esteem that its readings, if probable in\r\nthemselves, and supported (or even though not supported) by two or three\r\nother copies and versions, have been accepted in preference to the united\r\ntestimony of all authorities besides: while others, admitting the interest\r\ndue to age, have spoken of its text as one of the most vicious extant.\r\nWithout anticipating what must be discussed hereafter we may say at once,\r\nthat, while we accord to Cod. B at least as much weight as to any single\r\ndocument in existence, we ought never to forget that it is but one out of\r\nmany, several of them being nearly (and one quite) as old, and in other\r\nrespects not less worthy of confidence than itself. One marked feature,\r\ncharacteristic of this copy, is the great number of its omissions, which\r\nhas induced Dr. Dobbin to speak of it as presenting “an abbreviated text\r\nof the New Testament:” and certainly the facts he states on this point are\r\nstartling enough(159). He calculates that Codex B leaves out words or\r\nwhole clauses no less than 330 times in Matthew, 365 in Mark, 439 in Luke,\r\n357 in John, 384 in the Acts, 681 in the surviving Epistles; or 2,556\r\ntimes in all. That no small proportion of these are mere oversights of the\r\nscribe seems evident from the circumstance that this same scribe has\r\nrepeatedly written words and clauses _twice over_, a class of mistakes\r\nwhich Mai and the collators have seldom thought fit to notice, inasmuch as\r\nthe false addition has not been retraced by the second hand, but which by\r\nno means enhances our estimate of the care employed in copying this\r\nvenerable record of primitive Christianity(160). Hug and others have\r\nreferred the origin of Codex B to Egypt, but (unlike in this respect to\r\nCodex A) its history does not confirm their conjecture, and the argument\r\nderived from orthography or grammatical forms, is now well understood to\r\nbe but slight and ambiguous(161). Dr. Hort, on no very substantial\r\ngrounds, is “inclined to surmise that B and א were both written in the\r\nWest, probably at Rome” (Introduction, pp. 265-7).\r\n\r\nC. CODEX EPHRAEMI, No. 9, in the Royal Library of Paris, is a most\r\nvaluable palimpsest containing portions of the Septuagint version of the\r\nOld Testament on sixty-four leaves, and fragments of every part of the New\r\non 145 leaves, amounting on the whole to less than two-thirds of the\r\nvolume(162). This manuscript seems to have been brought from the East by\r\nAndrew John Lascar [d. 1535], a learned Greek patronized by Lorenzo de’\r\nMedici; it once belonged to Cardinal Nicolas Ridolphi of that family, was\r\nbrought into France by Queen Catherine de’ Medici of evil memory, and so\r\npassed into the Royal Library at Paris(163). The ancient writing is barely\r\nlegible, having been almost removed about the twelfth century to receive\r\nsome Greek works of St. Ephraem, the great Syrian Father [299-378]. A\r\nchemical preparation applied at the instance of Fleck in 1834, though it\r\nrevived much that was before illegible, has defaced the vellum with stains\r\nof various colours, from green and blue to black and brown. The older\r\nwriting was first noticed by Peter Allix nearly two centuries ago; various\r\nreadings extracted from it were communicated by Boivin to Kuster, who\r\npublished them (under the notation of Paris 9) in his edition of Mill’s N.\r\nT., 1710. A complete collation of the New Testament was first made in 1716\r\nby Wetstein, then very young, for Bentley’s projected edition, for which\r\nlabour (as he records the fact himself) he paid Wetstein £50. This\r\ncollation Wetstein of course used for his own Greek Testament of 1751-2,\r\nand though several persons subsequently examined the manuscript, and so\r\nbecame aware that more might be gathered from it, it was not until 1843\r\nthat Tischendorf brought out at Leipsic his full and noble edition of the\r\nNew Testament portion; the Old Testament he published in 1845. Although\r\nTischendorf complains of the typographical errors made in his absence in\r\nthe former of these two volumes, and has corrected them in the other, they\r\nprobably comprise by far the most masterly production of this nature up to\r\nthat date published; it is said too that none but those who have seen\r\nCodex C can appreciate the difficulty of deciphering some parts of\r\nit(164), in fact, whatever is not patent at first sight. The Prolegomena\r\nare especially valuable; the uncial type does not aim at being an\r\nimitation, but the facsimile faithfully represents the original, even to\r\nthe present colour of the ink. In shape Codex C is about the size of Cod.\r\nA, but not quite so tall; its vellum is hardly so fine as that of Cod. A\r\nand a few others, yet sufficiently good. In this copy there is but one\r\ncolumn in a page, which contains from forty to forty-six lines (usually\r\nforty-one), the characters being a little larger than those of either A or\r\nB, and somewhat more elaborate(165). Thus the points at the ends of\r\n_sigma_, _epsilon_, and especially of the horizontal line of _tau_ are\r\nmore decided than in Codex A; _delta_, though not so fully formed as in\r\nlater books, is less simple than in A, the strokes being of less equal\r\nthickness, and the base more ornamented. On the other hand, _alpha_ and\r\n_pi_ are nearer the model of Codex B. _Iota_ and _upsilon_, which in Cod.\r\nA and many other copies have two dots over them when they commence a\r\nsyllable, and are sometimes found with one dot, have here a small straight\r\nline in their place (_see_ p. 36). There are no breathings or accents by\r\nthe first hand: the apostrophus is found but rarely, chiefly with Proper\r\nnames, as _δαδ᾽_ The uncial writing is continuous; the punctuation of Cod.\r\nC, like that of A and B, consisting only of a single point, mostly but not\r\nalways put level with the top of the preceding letter; wherever such a\r\npoint was employed, a space of one letter broad was usually left vacant:\r\nthese points are most common in the later books of the N. T. The κεφάλαια\r\nare not placed in the upper margin of the page as in Cod. A, but a list of\r\ntheir τίτλοι preceded each Gospel: the so-called Ammonian sections stand\r\nin the margin, but not at present the Eusebian canons; though, since lines\r\nof the text written in vermilion have been thoroughly washed out, the\r\ncanons (for which that colour was commonly employed) may easily have\r\nshared the same fate (_see_ p. 61). There is no trace of chapters in the\r\nActs, Epistles, or Apocalypse, and both the titles and subscriptions to\r\nthe various books are very simple. Capital letters are used quite as\r\nfreely as in Cod. A, both at the commencement of the (Ammonian) sections,\r\nand in many other places. All these circumstances taken together indicate\r\nfor Cod. C as early a date as the fifth century, though there is no\r\nsufficient cause for deeming it at all older than Cod. A. Alexandria has\r\nbeen assigned as its native country, for the very insufficient reasons\r\nstated when we were describing A and B. It is carefully transcribed, and\r\nof its great critical value there is no doubt; its text seems to stand\r\nnearly midway between A and B, somewhat inclining to the latter. Two\r\ncorrectors have been very busily at work on Cod. C, greatly to the\r\nperplexity of the critical collator: they are respectively indicated by\r\nTischendorf as C**, C***. The earliest, or the second hand, may have been\r\nof the sixth century, and his corrections are for some cause regarded by\r\nDr. Hort as almost equally valuable for critical purposes with the\r\nmanuscript itself: the second corrector, or the third hand, is perhaps of\r\nthe ninth century, and he revised such portions as were adapted to\r\necclesiastical use, inserting many accents, the _rough_ breathing, and\r\nsome vocal notes. By him or more probably by a fourth hand (who did not\r\nchange the text, but added some liturgical directions in the margin) small\r\ncrosses were interpolated as stops, agreeably to the fashion of their\r\ntimes.\r\n\r\nD OF THE GOSPELS AND ACTS, CODEX BEZAE GRAECO-LATINUS, belongs to the\r\nUniversity Library at Cambridge, where the open volume is conspicuously\r\nexhibited to visitors in the New Building (Nn. ii. 41). It was presented\r\nto the University in 1581 by Theodore Beza, for whom and his master Calvin\r\nthe heads of that learned body then cherished a veneration which already\r\nboded ill for the peace of the English Church(166). Between the Gospels\r\n(whose order was spoken of above, pp. 72-4) and the Acts, the Catholic\r\nEpistles once stood, of which only a few verses remain in the Latin\r\ntranslation (3 John ver. 11-15), followed by the words “epistulae Johannis\r\nIII explicit, incipit actus apostolorum,” as if St. Jude’s Epistle were\r\ndisplaced or wanting. There are not a few hiatus both in the Greek and\r\nLatin texts(167). The contents of this remarkable document were partially\r\nmade known by numerous extracts from it, under the designation of β´ in\r\nthe margin of Robert Stephen’s Greek Testament of 1550, whose account of\r\nit is that it was collated for him in Italy by his friends (τὸ δὲ β´ ἐστὶ\r\nτὸ ἐν Ἰταλίᾳ ὑπὸ τῶν ἡμετέρων ἀντιβληθὲν φίλων. Epistle to the\r\nReader)(168). It is not very easy to reconcile this statement with Beza’s\r\naccount prefixed to the manuscript and still extant in his own cramped\r\nhandwriting, wherein he alleges that he obtained the volume in 1562 from\r\nthe monastery of St. Irenaeus at Lyons (“oriente ibi civili bello”), where\r\nit had long lain buried (“postquam ibi in pulvere diu jacuisset”). This\r\ngreat city, it must be remembered, was sacked in that very year by the\r\ninfamous Des Adrets, whom it suited to espouse for a while the cause of\r\nthe Huguenots; and we can hardly doubt that some one who had shared in the\r\nplunder of the abbey(169) conveyed this portion of it to Beza, whose\r\ninfluence at that juncture was paramount among the French Reformed(170).\r\n\r\nBeza in his editions of the Greek Testament published in 1582, 1589, and\r\n1598, made some occasional references to the readings of his manuscript.\r\nArchbishop Whitgift borrowed it from Cambridge in 1583, and caused a poor\r\ntranscript to be made of its Greek text, which he bequeathed to Trinity\r\nCollege (whereof he had been Master), in whose Library it still remains\r\n(B. x. 3).\r\n\r\nPatrick Young, of whom we have heard in connexion with Cod. A (p. 103 and\r\nnote 1), sent extracts from Cod. D to the brothers Dupuy at Paris, through\r\nwhom they reached Morinus and Steph. Curcellaeus. An unusually full\r\ncollation was made for Walton’s Polyglott (Tom. vi, Num. xvi, 1657) by\r\npious Archbishop Ussher, who devoted to these studies the doleful leisure\r\nof his latter years. Mill collated and Wetstein transcribed (1716) this\r\ndocument for their great editions of the Greek Testament, but they both\r\ndid their work carelessly; and though Bentley was allowed to keep it at\r\nhome for seven years, his notices of its readings, as represented by Mr.\r\nEllis (Bentleii Critica Sacra, pp. 2-26), or preserved in Stephen’s N. T.\r\nof 1549 (Trin. Coll. B. xvii. 4), were put to no practical use. The best\r\ncollation by far was made about 1732 by John Dickinson of St. John’s\r\nCollege for John Jackson of Leicester, with whose other books it came into\r\nJesus College Library (O. θ. 2), where it has lain neglected. But a\r\nmanuscript replete as this is with variations from the sacred text beyond\r\nall other example could be adequately represented only by being published\r\nin full; a design entrusted by the University of Cambridge to Dr. Thomas\r\nKipling, Senior Wrangler in 1768 and afterwards Dean of Peterborough [d.\r\n1822], whose “Codex Theodori Bezae Cantabrigiensis” 1793, 2 vols. fol. (in\r\ntype imitating the original handwriting much more closely than in Cod. A\r\nand the rest), is a not unfaithful transcript of the text(171), though the\r\nProlegomena too plainly testify to the editor’s pitiable ignorance of\r\nsacred criticism, while his habit of placing the readings of the several\r\nlater hands (very loosely distinguished from each other) in the text, and\r\nthose of the first hand in the notes (a defect we have also noted in the\r\nRoman editions of Cod. B), renders his volumes very inconvenient for use.\r\nLet Kipling be praised for the care and exact diligence his work evinces,\r\nbut Herbert Marsh [1757-1839] was of all Cambridge men of that period the\r\nonly one known to be competent for such a task. In 1864 the present writer\r\nwas aided by the Syndics of the Cambridge Press in publishing an edition\r\nof Codex Bezae in common type, illustrated by a copious Introduction and\r\ncritical notes, to which work the reader is referred for fuller\r\ninformation respecting this manuscript.\r\n\r\nThe Codex Bezae is a quarto volume 10 inches high by 8 broad, with one\r\ncolumn on a page, the Greek text and its Latin version being parallel, the\r\nGreek on the left, or _verso_ of each leaf, and the Latin on the right,\r\nopposite to it, on the _recto_ of the next. Notwithstanding the\r\nAlexandrian forms that abound in it as much as in any other copy, and\r\nwhich have been held by some to prove the Egyptian origin of Codd. ABC,\r\nthe fact of its having a Latin version sufficiently attests its Western\r\norigin. The vellum is not quite equal in fineness to that of a few others.\r\nThere are thirty-three lines in every page, and these of unequal length,\r\nas this manuscript is arranged in στίχοι, being the earliest in date that\r\nis so (_see_ p. 53). The Latin is placed in the same line and as nearly as\r\npossible in the same order as the corresponding Greek. It has not the\r\nlarger κεφάλαια or Eusebian canons, but only the so-called Ammonian\r\nsections, often incorrectly placed, and obviously in a later hand of about\r\nthe ninth century. The original absence of these divisions is no proof\r\nthat the book was not at first intended for ecclesiastical use (as some\r\nhave stated), inasmuch as the sections and canons were constructed for a\r\nvery different purpose (_see above_, pp. 59-63), but is another argument\r\nfor its being copied in the West, perhaps not far from the place where it\r\nrested so long. Other proofs of its Occidental, perhaps of its Gallican\r\norigin, especially that derived from the style of the Latin version, are\r\ncollected in Scrivener’s edition (Introd. pp. xxxi, xl-xlv). The\r\ncharacters are of the same size as in C, larger on the whole than in AB,\r\nbut betray a later age than any of these, although the Latin as well as\r\nthe Greek is written continuously, excepting that in the titles and\r\nsubscriptions of the several books (as in Codd. DH of St. Paul) the words\r\nare separated. This copy has paragraph divisions of unequal length\r\npeculiar to itself(172). They are indicated by placing the initial letter\r\nout in the margin, that letter being usually of the same size with the\r\nrest, though sometimes a little larger. Cod. D appears to be the earliest\r\nwhich exhibits larger letters after a pause in the middle of a line; but\r\nthese are not very frequent. Instances of each case may be noticed in our\r\nfacsimile (No. 42), wherein the shapes of _kappa_, _rho_ and _phi_, as\r\nindicated before (pp. 32, note 1, 37, 39), are very observable. The Greek\r\nand Latin writing on the opposite pages are much like each other in\r\nappearance, the Latin letters being round and flowing, not square as in\r\ncodices a little earlier in date, such as the Medicean and Vatican\r\nfragments of Virgil. This manuscript has been corrected, first by the\r\noriginal penman with a light stroke made by a pen nearly empty; after him\r\nby not less than eight or nine different revisers, some nearly coeval with\r\nthe Codex itself, others not many centuries old. The changes they have\r\nmade, especially when they employed a knife to scrape away the primitive\r\nreading, render too many places almost illegible. The first scribe often\r\nused a sponge to wash out his error before the ink was well dried in\r\n(_see_ p. 27). In addition to the single point about three-fourths of the\r\nheight of a letter up, which often subdivides the στίχοι in both languages\r\n(facsimile, No. 42, l. 9) the coarse late hand which inserted the Ammonian\r\nsections placed double dots (:) after the numerals, and often inserted\r\nsimilar points in the text, before or over the first letter of a section.\r\nEach member of the genealogy in Luke iii forms a separate στίχος, as in\r\nCod. B: quotations are indicated by throwing the commencement of the lines\r\nwhich contain them, both Greek and Latin, about an inch back or less (e.g.\r\nMatt. xxvi. 31; Mark i. 2, 3; Acts ii. 34, 35; iv. 25, 26). The first\r\nthree lines of each book, in both languages, were written in bright red\r\nink, which was also employed in the alternate lines of the subscriptions,\r\nand in other slight ornaments. The traces of the scribe’s needle and lines\r\n(_see_ p. 27) are very visible, the margin ample, and the volume on the\r\nwhole in good keeping, though its first extant page (Latin) is much\r\ndecayed, and it is stained in parts by some chemical mixture that has been\r\napplied to it. The portions supplied by a later hand are of course in the\r\nuncial Greek and cursive Latin characters usual at the dates assigned to\r\nthem. The liturgical notes in the margin of the Saturday and Sunday\r\nlessons (ανναγνοσμα is the form often used) are in thick letters, of a yet\r\nlater date than the Ammonian sections. A few others for the great Feasts\r\nand Fast days occur; and, in a hand of about the twelfth century, lessons\r\nfor the Festivals of St. George and St. Dionysius, the patron saints of\r\nEngland and France, as may be seen in the table of Menology.\r\n\r\nThe vellum employed for Codex Bezae is arranged in quires of four sheets\r\n(or eight leaves) each even throughout(173), the numeral signatures of\r\nwhich are set _primâ manu_ so low down in the margin at the foot of the\r\nlast page of each, that they are mostly cut off, in whole or partly, by\r\nthe binder. Assuming that it ended with the Acts of the Apostles, it\r\noriginally consisted of upwards of sixty-four (probably of sixty-seven)\r\nquires, of which the first, forty-fourth, and sixty-fourth, have each lost\r\nsome leaves, the thirty-fourth is entire though containing but six leaves,\r\nwhile those signed Γ (3), ΙΔ (14), ΚΒ (22), ΜΕ (45), down to ΝΒ (52), ΝΖ\r\n(57), and all after ΞΔ (64), are wholly wanting. The result is that out of\r\nthe 534 leaves it originally contained, only 406 now survive, about twelve\r\nof them being more or less mutilated. It is not easy to surmise what may\r\nhave been written on the sixty-seven leaves that intervened between ΜΔ 5\r\nand ΝΓ 1; the gap ends with 3 John ver. 11 (Greek), but the space is\r\napparently too great for the Catholic Epistles alone, even though we\r\nsuppose that Jude was inserted (as appears in some catalogues) otherwise\r\nthan in the last place. The leaves added by later hands are nine in\r\nnumber. The Greek portion of the supplement to St. John (xviii. 14-xx. 13)\r\nmuch resembles in text the style of the original manuscript, and is often\r\nsupported by Codd. אAB(C). The Latin of this portion is taken from the\r\nVulgate version.\r\n\r\nThe internal character of the Codex Bezae is a most difficult and indeed\r\nan almost inexhaustible theme. No known manuscript contains so many bold\r\nand extensive interpolations (six hundred, it is said, in the Acts alone),\r\ncountenanced, where they are not absolutely unsupported, chiefly by the\r\nOld Latin and the Curetonian version: its own parallel Latin translation\r\nis too servilely accommodated to the Greek text to be regarded as an\r\nindependent authority, save where the corresponding Greek is lost.\r\n\r\nThis passage was penned by Dr. Scrivener before the publication of the\r\nhighly ingenious treatise by Mr. Rendel Harris, entitled “A Study of the\r\nCodex Bezae” (1891), being the beginning of the second volume of the\r\nCambridge “Texts and Studies.” Mr. Harris from curious internal evidence,\r\nsuch as the existence in the text of a vitiated rendering of a verse of\r\nHomer which bears signs of having been retranslated from a Latin\r\ntranslation, infers that the Greek has been made up from the Latin, and\r\ntraces the latter to the second century. He shows its affinity with the\r\ntext of Irenaeus, and discovers traces in it of Montanism. He opens up\r\nmany points of interest for any one who would examine this “singular\r\nCodex”: but injustice must not be done to the fertile author by supposing\r\nthat in what is evidently ’a Study’ he concludes that he has settled all\r\nthe numerous questions which he broaches. No one however can really\r\ninvestigate the Codex Bezae without studying this work, which will be\r\nfound both instructive in the highest degree and amusing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V. UNCIAL MANUSCRIPTS OF THE GOSPELS.\r\n\r\n\r\nOf the manuscripts hitherto described, Codd. אABC for their presumed\r\ncritical value, Cod. D for its numberless and strange deviations from\r\nother authorities, and all five for their high antiquity, demanded a full\r\ndescription. Of those which follow many contain but a few fragments of the\r\nGospels, and others are so recent in date that they hardly exceed in\r\nimportance some of the best cursive copies (e.g. FGHS)(174). None of these\r\nneed detain us long.\r\n\r\nE. CODEX BASILIENSIS (B vi. 21, now A. N. iii. 12) (κεφ. τ., κεφ., _Am.,\r\nEus._ at foot of the pages) contains the four Gospels, excepting Luke iii.\r\n4-15; xxiv. 47-53, and was written about the middle of the eighth century,\r\nunless (with Dean Burgon) we refer it to the seventh. It measures 9 x 6-½\r\ninches, and contains 318 folios. There are 247 folios _verso_, and 71\r\n_recto_(175). Three leaves (160, 207, 214) on which are Luke i. 69-ii. 4;\r\nxii. 58-xiii. 12; xv. 8-20 are in a cursive and later hand, above the\r\nobliterated fragments of a homily as old as the main body of the\r\nmanuscript. There is a “liber praedicatorum” on the first folio. This copy\r\nis one of the most notable of the later uncials, and might well have been\r\npublished at length. It was given to a religious house in Basle by\r\nCardinal John de Ragusio, who was sent on a mission to the Greeks by the\r\nCouncil of Basle (1431), and probably brought it from Constantinople.\r\nErasmus much overlooked it for later books when preparing his Greek\r\nTestament at Basle; indeed it was not brought into the Public Library\r\nthere before 1559. A collation was sent to Mill by John Battier, Greek\r\nProfessor at Basle: Mill named it B. I, and truly declared it to be\r\n“probatae fidei et bonae notae.” Bengal (who obtained a few extracts from\r\nit) calls it Basil. _a_: but its first real collator was Wetstein, whose\r\nnative town it adorns. Since his time, Tischendorf in 1843, Professor\r\nMüller of Basle and Tregelles in 1846, have independently collated it\r\nthroughout. Judging from the specimen sent to him, Mill (N. T. Proleg. §\r\n1118) thought the hand much like that of Cod. A; the uncial letters\r\n(though not so regular or neat) are firm, round, and simple: indeed “the\r\npenmanship is exceedingly tasteful and delicate throughout. The employment\r\nof green, blue, and vermilion in the capitals I do not remember to have\r\nmet with elsewhere” (Burgon, _Guardian_, Jan. 29, 1873). There is but one\r\ncolumn of about twenty-four lines on the page; it has breathings and\r\naccents pretty uniformly, and not ill placed; otherwise, from the shape of\r\nmost of the letters (e.g. _pi_, facsimile No. 27, lines 1, 3), it might be\r\njudged of earlier date: observe, however, the oblong form of _omicron_\r\nwhere the space is crowded in the last line of the facsimile, when the\r\nolder scribes would have retained the circular shape and made the letter\r\nvery small (_see_ facsimile No. 11 b. l. 6): _delta_ also and _xi_ betray\r\na less ancient scribe. The single stop in Cod. E, as was stated above (p.\r\n48), changes its place according to the variation of its power, as in\r\nother copies of about the same age. The capitals at the beginning of\r\nsections stand out in the margin as in Codd. AC. The lists of the larger\r\nκεφάλαια together with the numbers of the sections in the margin and the\r\nEusebian canons beneath them, as well as harmonizing references to the\r\nother Gospels at the foot of the page, names of Feast days with their\r\nProper lessons, and other liturgical notices, have been inserted (as some\r\nthink, but erroneously in Burgon’s judgement) by a later hand. Under the\r\ntext (Mark i. 5, 6) are placed the harmonizing references, in the order\r\n(varying in each Gospel) Mark, Luke, John, Matthew. Ιω (John) furnishes no\r\nparallel on this page. The first section (α) of Μρ (Mark i. 1, 2)\r\ncorresponds to the seventieth (ο) of Λο (Luke vii. 27), and to the 103rd\r\n(ργ) of M (Matt. xi. 10). Again the second (β) of Mark (i. 3) is parallel\r\nto the seventh (ζ) of Luke (iii. 3), and to the eighth (η) of Matt. (iii.\r\n3). The passage given in our facsimile (No. 27) is part of the third (γ)\r\nof Mark (i. 4-6), and answers to nothing in Luke, but to the ninth (θ) of\r\nMatt. (iii. 4-6). See p. 60, note 4. The value of this codex, as supplying\r\nmaterials for criticism, is considerable. It approaches more nearly than\r\nsome others of its date to the text now commonly received, and is an\r\nexcellent witness for it. The asterisk is much used to indicate disputed\r\npassages: e.g. Matt. xvi. 2, 3: Luke xxii. 43, 44; xxiii. 34: John viii.\r\n2-11. (For the fragments attached to this Codex, _see_ Apoc. 15.)\r\n\r\nF. CODEX BOREELI, now in the Public Library at Utrecht, once belonged to\r\nJohn Boreel [d. 1629], Dutch ambassador at the court of King James I.\r\nWetstein obtained some readings from it in 1730, as far as Luke xi, but\r\nstated that he knew not where it then was. In 1830 Professor Heringa of\r\nUtrecht discovered it in private hands at Arnheim, and procured it for his\r\nUniversity Library, where in 1850 Tregelles found it, though with some\r\ndifficulty, the leaves being torn and all loose in a box, and he then made\r\na facsimile; Tischendorf had looked through it in 1841. In 1843, after\r\nHeringa’s death, H. E. Vinke published that scholar’s “Disputatio de\r\nCodice Boreeliano,” which includes a full and exact collation of the text.\r\nCod. F contains the Four Gospels with many defects, some of which have\r\nbeen caused since the collation was made which Wetstein published: hence\r\nthe codex must still sometimes be cited on his authority as Fw. In fact\r\nthere are but 204 leaves and a few fragments remaining, written with two\r\ncolumns of about nineteen lines each on the page, in a tall, oblong,\r\nupright form; it was referred by Mr. H. Deane in 1876 to the eighth, by\r\nTischendorf to the ninth, by Tregelles to the tenth century. In St. Luke\r\nthere are no less than twenty-four gaps: in Wetstein’s collation it began\r\nat Matt. vii. 6, but now at Matt. ix. 1. Other hiatus are Matt. xii. 1-44;\r\nxiii. 55-xiv. 9; xv. 20-31; xx. 18-xxi. 5: Mark i. 43-ii. 8; ii. 23-iii.\r\n5; xi. 6-26; xiv. 54-xv. 5; xv. 39-xvi. 19: John iii. 5-14; iv. 23-38; v.\r\n18-38; vi. 39-63; vii. 28-viii. 10; x. 32-xi. 3; xi. 40-xii. 3; xii.\r\n14-25: it ends at John xiii. 34. Few manuscripts have fallen into such\r\nunworthy hands. The Eusebian canons are wanting, the sections standing\r\nwithout them in the margin. Thus in Mark x. 13 (see facsimile No. 28) the\r\nsection ρϛ (106) has not under it the proper canon β (2). The letters\r\n_delta_, _epsilon_, _theta_, _omicron_, and especially the cross-like\r\n_psi_ (_see_ p. 40), are of the most recent uncial form, _phi_ is large\r\nand bevelled at both ends; the breathings and accents are fully and not\r\nincorrectly given.\r\n\r\nFa. CODEX COISLIN. I is that great copy of the Septuagint Octateuch, the\r\nglory of the Coislin Library, first made known by Montfaucon (Biblioth.\r\nCoislin., 1715), and illustrated by a facsimile in Silvestre’s Paléogr.\r\nUniv. No. 65. It contains 227 leaves in two columns, 13 inches by 9: the\r\nfine massive uncials of the sixth or seventh century are much like Cod.\r\nA’s in general appearance. In the margin _primâ manu_ Wetstein found Acts\r\nix. 24, 25, and so inserted this as Cod. F in his list of MSS. of the\r\nActs. In 1842 Tischendorf observed nineteen other passages of the New\r\nTestament, which he published in his Monumenta sacra inedita (1846, p.\r\n400, &c.) with a facsimile. The texts are Matt. v. 48; xii. 48; xxvii. 25:\r\nLuke i. 42; ii. 24; xxiii. 21: John v. 35; vi. 53, 55: Acts iv. 33, 34;\r\nix. 24, 25; x. 13, 15; xxii. 22: 1 Cor. vii. 39; xi. 29: 1 Cor. iii. 13;\r\nix. 7; xi. 33: Gal. iv. 21, 22: Col. ii. 16, 17; Heb. x. 26.\r\n\r\nG. COD. HARLEIAN. 5684 or WOLFII A; H. COD. WOLFII B. These two copies\r\nwere brought from the East by Andrew Erasmus Seidel, purchased by La\r\nCroze, and by him presented to J. C. Wolff, who published loose extracts\r\nfrom them both in his “Anecdota Graeca” (vol. iii. 1723), and barbarously\r\nmutilated them in 1721 in order to send pieces to Bentley, among whose\r\npapers in Trinity College Library (B. XVII. 20) Tregelles found the\r\nfragments in 1845 (Account of the Printed Text, p. 160). Subsequently Cod.\r\nG came with the rest of the Harleian collection into the British Museum;\r\nCod. H, which had long been missing, was brought to light in the Public\r\nLibrary of Hamburg, through Petersen the Librarian, in 1838. Codd. GH have\r\nnow been thoroughly collated both by Tischendorf and Tregelles. Cod. G\r\nappears to be of the tenth, Cod. H of the ninth century, and is stated to\r\nbe of higher critical value. Besides the mutilated fragments at Trinity\r\nCollege (Matt. v. 29-31; 39-43 of Cod. G; Luke i. 3-6; 13-15 of Cod. H),\r\nmany parts of both have perished: viz. in Cod. G 372 verses; Matt. i.\r\n1-vi. 6; vii. 25-viii. 9; viii. 23-ix. 2; xxviii. 18-Mark i. 13; xiv.\r\n19-25: Luke i. 1-13; v. 4-vii. 3; viii. 46-ix. 5; xii. 27-41; xxiv. 41-53:\r\nJohn xviii. 5-19; xix. 4-27 (of which one later hand supplies Matt,\r\nxxviii. 18-Mark i. 8: John xviii. 5-19; another Luke xii. 27-41): in Cod.\r\nH 679 verses; Matt. i. 1-xv. 30; xxv. 33-xxvi. 3; Mark i. 32-ii. 4; xv.\r\n44-xvi. 14; Luke v. 18-32; vi. 8-22; x. 2-19: John ix. 30-x. 25; xviii.\r\n2-18; xx. 12-25. Cod. G has some Church notes in the margin; Cod. H the\r\nsections without the Eusebian canons; G however has both sections and\r\ncanons; its τίτλοι and larger κεφάλαια are in red (those of St. John being\r\nlost), and the Church notes seem _primâ manu_. Each member of the\r\ngenealogy in Luke iii forms a separate line. Both G and H are written in a\r\nsomewhat rude style, with breathings and accents rather irregularly\r\nplaced, as was the fashion of their times; G in two columns of twenty-two\r\nlines each on a page, H in one column of twenty-three lines. In each the\r\nlatest form of the uncial letters is very manifest (e.g. _delta_,\r\n_theta_), but G is the neater of the two. In G the single point, in H a\r\nkind of Maltese cross, are the prevailing marks of punctuation. Our\r\nfacsimiles (Nos. 29 of G, 31 of H) are due to Tregelles; that of G he took\r\nfrom the fragment at Trinity College. Inasmuch as beside Matt. v. 30, 31\r\nin Cod. G ΑΡ [with a χ between and above them] (ἀρχή) is conspicuous in\r\nthe margin, and ΤΕ Τ_Η_Σ _Λε_ (τέλος τῆς λέξεως) stands in the text\r\nitself, good scholars may be excused for having mistaken it for a scrap of\r\nsome Evangelistarium.\r\n\r\nI. COD. TISCHENDORFIAN. II at St. Petersburg, consists of palimpsest\r\nfragments found by Tischendorf in 1853 “in the dust of an Eastern\r\nlibrary,” i.e. in the Convent of St. Saba near the Red Sea, and published\r\nin his new series of “Monumenta sacra inedita,” vol. i, 1855. On the\r\ntwenty-eight vellum leaves (eight of them on four double leaves) Georgian\r\nwriting covers the partially obliterated Greek, which is for the most part\r\nvery hard to read. They compose portions of no less than seven different\r\nmanuscripts; the first two, of the fifth century, are as old as Codd. AC\r\n(the first having scarcely any capital letters and those very slightly\r\nlarger than the rest); the third fragment seems of the sixth century,\r\nnearly of the date of Cod. N (p. 139), about as old as Cod. P (_see_ p.\r\n143); the fourth scarcely less ancient: all four, like other palimpsests,\r\nhave the pseudo-Ammonian sections without the Eusebian canons (_see_ p.\r\n61).  Of the Gospels we have 190 verses: viz. (_Frag._ 1 or Ia) John xi.\r\n50-xii. 9; xv. 12-xvi. 2; xix. 11-24: (_Frag._ 2 or Ib) Matt. xiv. 13-16;\r\n19-23; xxiv. 37-xxv. 1; xxv. 32-45; xxvi. 31-45: Mark ix. 14-22; xiv.\r\n58-70: (_Frag._ 3 or Ic) Matt. xvii. 22-xviii. 3; xviii. 11-19; xix. 5-14:\r\nLuke xviii. 14-25; John iv. 52-v. 8; xx. 17-26: (_Frag._ 4 or Id) Luke\r\nvii. 39-49; xxiv. 10-19. The fifth fragment (Ie), containing portions of\r\nthe Acts and of St. Paul’s Epistles (1 Cor. xv. 53-xvi. 9; Tit. i. 1-13;\r\nActs xxviii. 8-17) is as old as the third, if not as the first. The sixth\r\nand seventh fragments are of the seventh century: viz. (_Frag._ 6 or If,\r\n_of two leaves_) Acts ii. 6-17; xxvi. 7-18: (_Frag._ 7 or Ig, _of one\r\nleaf_) Acts xiii. 39-46. In all seven are 255 verses. All except _Frag._ 6\r\nare in two columns of from twenty-nine to eighteen lines each, and\r\nunaccentuated; _Frag._ 6 has but one column on a page, with some accents.\r\nThe first five fragments, so far as they extend, must be placed in the\r\nhighest rank as critical authorities. The first, as cited in Tischendorf’s\r\neighth edition of his Greek Testament, agrees with Cod. A thirty-four\r\ntimes, four times with Cod. B, and twenty-three times with the two united;\r\nit stands alone eleven times. The text of the second and third is more\r\nmixed though they incline more to favour Codd. אB; not, however, so\r\ndecidedly as the first does Cod. A. Tischendorf gives us six facsimiles of\r\nthem in the “Monumenta sacra inedita,”. Nova Collect. vol. i (1885), a\r\nseventh in “Anecdota sacra et profana,” 1855. From the same Armenian book,\r\nas Tischendorf thinks (and he was very likely to _know_), are taken the\r\nthree palimpsest leaves of 2 and 3 Kings, and the six of Isaiah published\r\nby him in the same volume of the “Monumenta.”\r\n\r\nIb. See Nb, below.\r\n\r\nK. COD. CYPRIUS, or No. 63 of the Royal Library at Paris, shares only with\r\nCodd. אBMSU the advantage of being a _complete_ uncial copy of the Four\r\nGospels. It was brought into the Colbert Library from Cyprus in 1673; Mill\r\ninserted its readings from Simon; it was re-examined by Scholz, whose\r\ninaccuracies (especially those committed when collating Cod. K for his\r\n“Curae Criticae in Historiam textûs Evangeliorum,” Heidelberg, 1820) have\r\nbeen strongly denounced by later editors, and it must be feared with too\r\ngood reason. The independent collations of Tischendorf and Tregelles have\r\nnow done all that can be needed for this copy. It is an oblong quarto, in\r\ncompressed uncials, of about the middle of the ninth century at the\r\nlatest, having one column of about twenty-one lines on each page, but the\r\nhandwriting is irregular and varies much in size. A single point being\r\noften found where the sense does not require it, this codex has been\r\nthought to have been copied from an older one arranged in στίχοι; the ends\r\nof each στίχος may have been indicated in this manner by the scribe. The\r\nsubscriptions, τίτλοι, the sections, and indices of the κεφάλαια of the\r\nlast three Gospels are believed to be the work of a later hand: the\r\nEusebian canons are absent. The breathings and accents are _primâ manu_,\r\nbut often omitted or incorrectly placed. Itacisms and permutations of\r\nconsonants are very frequent, and the text is of an unusual and\r\ninteresting character. Scholz regards the directions for the Church\r\nlessons, even the ἀρχαί and τέλη in the margin at the beginning and end of\r\nlessons, as by the original scribe. He transcribes at length the\r\nἐκλογάδιον τῶν δ᾽ εὐαγγελιστῶν and the fragments of a menology prefixed to\r\nCod. K (N. T. vol. i, pp. 455-493), of which tables it affords the\r\nearliest specimen. The second hand writes at the end προσδέξηται αὐτὴν\r\n[τὴν δέλτον] ἡ παναγία θεοτόκος καὶ ὁ ἅγιος εὐτύχιος. The style of this\r\ncopy will be seen from our facsimile (No. 19) taken from John vi. 52, 53:\r\nthe number of the section (ξϛ´) or 66 stands in the margin, but the\r\nordinary place of the Eusebian canon (ι or 10) under it is filled by a\r\nsimple flourish. The stop in 1. 1 after λεγοντεσ illustrates the unusual\r\npunctuation of this copy, as may that after ὁ _ισ_ in 1. 3.\r\n\r\nL. COD. REGIUS, No. 62 in the Royal Library at Paris, is by far the most\r\nremarkable document of its age and class. It contains the Four Gospels,\r\nexcept the following passages, Matt. iv. 22-v. 14; xxviii. 17-20: Mark x.\r\n16-30; xv. 2-20: John xxi. 15-25. It was written in about the eighth\r\ncentury and consists of 257 leaves quarto, of thick vellum, 9 inches high\r\nby 6-½ broad, with two columns of twenty-five lines each on a page,\r\nregularly marked, as we so often see, by the _stilus_ and ruler (p. 27).\r\nThis is doubtless Stephen’s η´, though he cites it erroneously in Acts\r\nxxiv. 7 bis; xxv. 14; xxvii. 1; xxviii. 11: it was even then in the Royal\r\nLibrary, although “Roberto Stephano” is marked in the volume. Wetstein\r\ncollated Cod. L but loosely; Griesbach, who set a very high value on it,\r\nstudied it with peculiar care; Tischendorf published it in full in his\r\n“Monumenta sacra inedita,” 1846. It is but carelessly written, and abounds\r\nwith errors of the ignorant scribe, who was more probably an Egyptian than\r\na native Greek. The breathings and accents are often deficient, often\r\nadded wrongly, and placed throughout without rule or propriety. The\r\napostrophus also is common, and frequently out of place; the points for\r\nstops are quite irregular, as we have elsewhere stated (p. 48). Capitals\r\noccur plentifully, often painted and in questionable taste (see facsimile\r\nNo. 21, column 2), and there is a tendency throughout to inelegant\r\nornament. This codex is in bad condition through damp, the ink brown or\r\npale, the uncial letters of a debased oblong shape: _phi_ is enormously\r\nlarge and sometimes quite angular; other letters are such as might be\r\nlooked for from its date, and are neither neat nor remarkably clear. The\r\nlessons for Sundays, festivals, &c. and the ἀρχαί and τέλη are marked\r\neverywhere in the margin, especially in St. Matthew; there are also many\r\ncorrections and important critical notes (e.g. Mark xvi. 8) in the text or\r\nmargin, apparently _primâ manu_. Our facsimile is taken from a photograph\r\nof its most important page, Mark xvi. 8, 9, with part of the note cited at\r\nlength below. Before each Gospel are indices of the κεφάλαια, now\r\nimperfect: we find also the τίτλοι at the head and occasionally at the\r\nfoot of the several pages; the numbers of the κεφάλαια (usually pointed\r\nout by the sign of the cross), the sections and Eusebian canons stand in\r\nthe inner margin(176) often ill put, as if only half understood. The\r\ncritical weight of this copy may best be discussed hereafter; it will here\r\nsuffice barely to mention its strong resemblance to Cod. B (less, however,\r\nin St. John’s Gospel than elsewhere), to the citations of Origen\r\n[186-253], and to the margin of the Harkleian Syriac version [A.D. 616].\r\nCod. L abounds in what are termed Alexandrian forms, beyond any other copy\r\nof its date.\r\n\r\nM. COD. CAMPIANUS, No. 48 in the Royal Library at Paris, contains the Four\r\nGospels complete in a small quarto form, written in very elegant and\r\nminute uncials of the end of the ninth century, with two columns of\r\ntwenty-four lines each on a page. The Abbé François de Camps gave it to\r\nLouis XIV, Jan. 1, 1707. This document is Kuster’s 2 (1710); it was\r\ncollated by Wetstein, Scholz, and Tregelles; transcribed in 1841 by\r\nTischendorf. Its synaxarion and menology have been published by Scholz in\r\nthe same place as those of Cod. K, and obviously with great carelessness.\r\nἈναγνώσματα, i.e. notes of the Church Lessons, abound in the margin\r\n(Tischendorf thinks them _primâ manu_) in a very small hand, like in style\r\nto the Oxford Plato (Clarke 39, _above_, p. 42). We find too Hippolytus’\r\nChronology of the Gospels, Eusebius’ letter to Carpianus with his canons,\r\nand some Arabic scrawl on the last leaf, of which the name of Jerusalem\r\nalone has been read, a note in Slavonic, and others in a contemporaneous\r\ncursive hand. Dean Burgon also observed at the foot of the several pages\r\nthe same kind of harmony as we described for Cod. E. It has breathings,\r\naccents pretty fairly given, and a musical notation in red, so frequent in\r\nChurch manuscripts of the age. Its readings are very good; itacisms and ν\r\nἐφελκυστικόν are frequent. Tischendorf compares the form of its uncials to\r\nthose of Cod. V; which, judging from the facsimile given by Matthaei, we\r\nshould deem somewhat less beautiful. From our facsimile (No. 32) it will\r\nbe seen that the round letters are much narrowed, the later form of\r\n_delta_ and _theta_ quite decided, while _alpha_ and _pi_ might look\r\nearlier. Our specimen (John vii. 53-viii. 2) represents the celebrated\r\nPericope adulterae in one of its earliest forms.\r\n\r\nN. CODEX PURPUREUS. Only twelve leaves of this beautiful copy were till\r\nrecently believed to survive, and some former possessor must have divided\r\nthem in order to obtain a better price from several purchasers than from\r\none. Four leaves are now in the British Museum (Cotton, Titus C. xv), six\r\nin the Vatican (No. 3785), two at Vienna (Lambec. 2), at the end of a\r\nfragment of Genesis in a different hand. The London fragments (Matt. xxvi.\r\n57-65; xxvii. 26-34: John xiv. 2-10; xv. 15-22) were collated by Wetstein\r\non his first visit to England in 1715, and marked in his Greek Testament\r\nby the letter J: Scrivener transcribed them in 1845, and announced that\r\nthey contained fifty-seven various readings, of which Wetstein had given\r\nbut five. The Vienna fragment (Luke xxiv. 13-21; 39-49) had long been\r\nknown by the descriptions of Lambecius: Wetstein had called it N; Treschow\r\nin 1773 and Alter in 1787 had given imperfect collations of it. Scholz\r\nfirst noticed the Vatican leaves (Matt. xix. 6-13; xx. 6-22; xx. 29-xxi.\r\n19), denoted them by Γ, and used some readings extracted by Gaetano\r\nMarini. It was reserved for Tischendorf (Monumenta sacra inedita, 1846) to\r\npublish them all in full, and to determine by actual inspection that they\r\nwere portions of the same manuscript, of the date of about the end of the\r\nsixth century. Besides these twelve leaves John Sakkelion the Librarian\r\nsaw in or about 1864 at the Monastery of St. John in Patmos thirty-three\r\nother leaves containing portions of St. Mark’s Gospel (ch. vi. 53-xv.\r\n23)(177), whose readings were communicated to Tischendorf, and are\r\nincluded in his eighth edition of the N. T. The others were probably\r\nstolen from the same place. This book is written on the thinnest vellum\r\n(_see_ pp. 23, 25), dyed purple, and the silver letters (which have turned\r\nquite black) were impressed in some way upon it, but are too varied in\r\nshape, and at the end of the lines in size, to admit the supposition of\r\nmoveable type being used, as some have thought to be the case in the Codex\r\nArgenteus of the Gothic Gospels. The abridgements _ΘΣ_, _ΧΣ_, &c. are in\r\ngold; and some changes have been made by an ancient second hand. The\r\nso-called Ammonian sections and the Eusebian canons are faithfully given\r\n(_see_ p. 59), and the Vatican portion has the forty-first, forty-sixth,\r\nand forty-seventh τίτλοι of St. Matthew at the head of the pages. Each\r\npage has two columns of sixteen lines, and the letters (about ten or\r\ntwelve in a line) are firm, uniform, bold, and unornamented, though not\r\nquite so much so as in a few older documents; their lower extremities are\r\nbevelled. Their size is at least four times that of the letters in Cod. A,\r\nthe punctuation quite as simple, being a single point (and that usually\r\nneglected) level with the top of the letter (see our facsimile, Plate v,\r\nNo. 14, l. 3), and there is no space left between words even after stops.\r\nA few letters stand out as capitals at the beginning of lines; of the\r\nbreathings and accents, if such they be, we have spoken above (p. 47).\r\nLetters diminished at the end of a line do not lose their ancient shape,\r\nas in many later books: _compendia scribendi_ are rare, yet [symbol]\r\nstands for Ν at the end of a line no less than twenty-nine times in the\r\nLondon leaves alone, but [symbol] for αι only once. Ι at the beginning of\r\na syllable has two dots over it, Υ but one. We have discussed above (pp.\r\n32-39) the shape of the alphabet in Ν (for by that single letter\r\nTischendorf denotes it), and compared it with others of nearly the same\r\ndate; _alpha_, _omega_, _lambda_ look more ancient than _delta_ or _xi_\r\n(_see_ Plate ii. No. 4). It exhibits strong Alexandrian forms, e.g.\r\nπαραλήμψομε, ειχοσαν (the latter condemned _secundâ manu_), and not a few\r\nsuch itacisms as the changes of ι and ει, αι and ε.\r\n\r\nCOD. Nb (Ib of Tischendorf’s N. T., eighth edition), MUSEI BRITANNICI\r\n(Addit. 17136), is a 12mo volume containing the hymns of Severus in\r\nSyriac, and is one of the books brought thither from the Nitrian desert.\r\nIt is a palimpsest, with a second Syriac work written below the first,\r\nand, under both, _four_ leaves (117, 118, 127, 128) contain fragments of\r\nseventeen verses of St. John (xiii. 16; 17; 19; 20; 23; 24; 26; 27; xvi.\r\n7; 8; 9 although only one word—περί—is preserved; 12; 13; 15; 16; 18; 19).\r\nThese Tischendorf (and Tregelles about the same time) deciphered with\r\ngreat difficulty, as every one who has examined the manuscript would\r\nanticipate, and published in the second volume of his new collection of\r\n“Monumenta sacra inedita.” Each page contained two columns. We meet with\r\nthe sections without the Eusebian canons, the earliest form of uncial\r\ncharacters, no capital letters (_see_ p. 51, note 2), and only the\r\nsimplest kind of punctuation, although one rough breathing is legible.\r\nTischendorf hesitates whether he shall assign the fragment to the fourth\r\nor fifth century. It agrees with Cod. A five or six times, with Cod. B\r\nfive, with the two together six, and is against them both thrice.\r\n\r\nO. No less than nine small fragments have borne this mark. O of Wetstein\r\nwas given by Anselmo Banduri to Montfaucon, and contains only Luke xviii.\r\n11-14: _this_ Tischendorf discards as taken from an Evangelistarium (of\r\nthe tenth century, as he judges from the writing) chiefly because it wants\r\nthe number of the section at ver. 14. In its room he puts for Cod. O\r\nMoscow Synod. 120 (Matthaei, 15), a few leaves of about the ninth century\r\n(containing the fifteen verses, John i. 1, 3, 4; xx. 10-13; 15-17; 20-24,\r\nwith some scholia), which had been used for binding a copy of Chrysostom’s\r\nHomilies on Genesis, brought from the monastery of Dionysius at Mount\r\nAthos, and published in Matthaei’s Greek Testament with a facsimile (_see_\r\nix. 257 &c., and facsimile in tom. xii). Further portions of this fragment\r\nwere seen at Athos in 1864 by Mr. Philip E. Pusey. Tregelles has also\r\nappended it to his edition of Cod. Ξ. In this fragment we find the\r\ncross-like _psi_, the interrogative “;” (John xx. 13), and the comma (ib.\r\nver. 12). Alford’s Frag. Ath. b=Tisch. We—p. 145—and Frag. Ath. a are\r\nprobably parts of O. The next five comprise N. T. hymns.\r\n\r\nCOD. Oa. _Magnificat_ and _Benedictus_ in Greek uncials of the eighth or\r\nninth century, in a Latin book at Wolfenbüttel, is published by\r\nTischendorf, Anecdota sacr. et prof. 1855; as is also Ob, which contains\r\nthese two and _Nunc Dimittis_, of the ninth century, and is at Oxford,\r\nBodleian, Misc. Gr. 5, ff. 313-4(178). Oc. _Magnificat_ in the Verona\r\nPsalter of the sixth century (the Greek being written in Latin letters),\r\npublished by Bianchini (Vindiciae Canon. Script. 1740). Od, Oe, both\r\ncontain the three hymns, Od in the great purple and silver Zurich Psalter\r\nof the seventh century (Tischendorf, Monum. sacra inedita, tom. iv,\r\n1869)(179); Oe of the ninth century at St. Gall (Cod. 17), partly written\r\nin Greek, partly in Latin. Of, also of the ninth century, is described by\r\nTischendorf (N. T., eighth edition) once as “Noroff. Petrop.,” once as\r\n“Mosquensis.” Og (IX) in the Arsenal Library at Paris (MS. Gr. 2),\r\ncontaining, besides the Psalms and Canticle of the Old Testament, the\r\n_Magnificat_, _Benedictus_, and _Nunc Dimittis_, besides the _Lord’s\r\nPrayer_, the _Sanctus_ and other such pieces. Oh. Taurinensis Reg. B. vii.\r\n30 (viii or ix), 5-¾ × 4, ff. 303 (20)(180).  Psalter with Luke i. 46-55;\r\nii. 29-31. See Gregory, Prolegomena, p. 441.\r\n\r\nP. CODEX GUELPHERBYTANUS A, and Q. CODEX GUELPHERBYTANUS B. These are two\r\npalimpsests discovered by F. A. Knittel, Archdeacon of Wolfenbüttel, in\r\nthe Ducal Library of that city, which (together with some fragments of\r\nUlphilas’ Gothic version) lie under the more modern writings of Isidore of\r\nSeville. He published the whole in 1762(181), so far at least as he could\r\nread them, though Tregelles believed more might be deciphered, and\r\nTischendorf, with his unconquerable energy, collating them both in 1854,\r\nwas able to re-edit them more accurately, Cod. Q in the third volume\r\n(1860) and Cod. P in the sixth (1869) of his Monumenta sacra inedita. The\r\nvolume (called the Codex Carolinus) seems to have been once at Bobbio, and\r\nhas been traced from Weissenburg to Mayence and Prague, till it was bought\r\nby a Duke of Brunswick in 1689. Codex P contains, on forty-three or\r\nforty-four leaves, thirty-one fragments of 518 verses, taken from all the\r\nfour Evangelists(182); Codex Q, on thirteen leaves, twelve fragments of\r\n247 verses from SS. Luke and John(183); but all can be traced only with\r\ngreat difficulty. A few portions, once written in vermilion, have quite\r\ndeparted, but Tischendorf has made material additions to Knittel’s\r\nlabours, both in extent and accuracy. He assigns P to the sixth, Q to the\r\nfifth century. Both are written in two columns, the uncials being bold,\r\nround or square, those of Q not a little the smaller. The letters in P,\r\nhowever, are sometimes compressed at the end of a line. The capitals in P\r\nare large and frequent, and both have the sections without the canons of\r\nEusebius (_see_ p. 59). The table of τίτλοι found in the volume is written\r\nin oblong uncials of a lower date, as Knittel thought, possibly without\r\ngood reason. Itacisms, what are termed Alexandrian forms, and the usual\r\ncontractions (_ΙΣ_, _ΞΣ_, _ΚΣ_, _ΘΣ_, _ΥΣ_, _ΠΗΡ_, _ΠΝΑ_, _ΙΛΗΜ_, _ΑΝΟΣ_,\r\n_ΔΑΔ_, Μ [with symbol above it]) occur in both copies. Breathings also are\r\nseen here and there in Q. From Tischendorf’s beautiful facsimiles of Codd.\r\nPQ we observe that while _delta_ is far more elaborate in P than in Q, the\r\nprecise contrary is the case with _pi_. _Epsilon_ and _sigma_ in P have\r\nstrong points at all the extremities; _nu_ in each is of the ancient form\r\nexhibited in Codd. אNR (_see_ p. 37); while in P _alpha_ resembles in\r\nshape that of our alphabet in Plate ii. No. 5, _eta_ that in Plate iii.\r\nNo. 7. As regards their text we observe that in the first hundred verses\r\nof St. Luke which are contained in both copies, wherein P is cited for\r\nvarious readings 216 times, and Q 182 times, P stands alone fourteen\r\ntimes, Q not once. P agrees with other manuscripts against AB twenty-one\r\ntimes, Q nineteen: P agrees with AB united fifty times, Q also fifty: P\r\nsides with B against A twenty-nine times, Q thirty-eight: but P accords\r\nwith A against B in 102 places, Q in seventy-five.\r\n\r\nR. This letter, like some that precede, has been used to represent\r\ndifferent books by various editors, a practice the inconvenience of which\r\nis very manifest. (1) R of Griesbach and Scholz is a fragment of one\r\nquarto leaf containing John i. 38-50, at Tübingen, with musical notes,\r\nwhich from its thick vellum, from the want of the sections and Eusebian\r\ncanons, and the general resemblance of its uncials to those of late\r\nService Books, Tischendorf pronounces to be an Evangelistarium, and puts\r\nin its room (2) in his N. T. of 1849, fourteen leaves of a palimpsest in\r\nthe Royal Library of Naples (Borbon. ii. C. 15) of the eighth century,\r\nunder a _Typicum_ (see Suicer, Thes. Eccles. tom. ii. p. 1335), or Ritual\r\nof the Greek Church, of the fourteenth century. These are fragments from\r\nthe first three Evangelists, in oblong uncials, leaning to the right.\r\nTischendorf, by chemical applications, was able in 1843 to read one page,\r\nin two columns of twenty-five lines each (Mark xiv. 32-39)(184), and saw\r\nthe sections in the margin; the Eusebian canons he thinks have been washed\r\nout (_see_ p. 59): but in 1859 he calls this fragment Wb, reserving the\r\nletter R for (3) CODEX NITRIENSIS, Brit. Museum, Additional 17211, the\r\nvery important palimpsest containing on forty-eight (53) leaves about 516\r\nverses of St. Luke in twenty-five fragments(185), under the black, broad\r\nSyriac writing, being a treatise of Severus of Antioch against Johannes\r\nGrammaticus, of the eighth or ninth century. There are two columns of\r\nabout twenty-five lines each on a page; for their boldness and simplicity\r\nthe letters may be referred to the end of the sixth century; we have given\r\na facsimile of the manuscript (which cannot be read in parts but with the\r\nutmost difficulty), and an alphabet collected from it (Nos. 5, 17). In\r\nsize and shape the letters are much like those of Codd. INP, only that\r\nthey are somewhat irregular and straggling: the punctuation is effected by\r\na single point almost level with the top of the letters, as in Cod. N. The\r\npseudo-Ammonian sections are there without the Eusebian canons, and the\r\nfirst two leaves are devoted to the τίτλοι of St. Luke. This most\r\nimportant palimpsest is one of the 550 manuscripts brought to England,\r\nabout 1847, from the Syrian convent of S. Mary Deipara, in the Nitrian\r\nDesert, seventy miles N. W. of Cairo. When examined at the British Museum\r\nby the late Canon Cureton, then one of the Librarians, he discovered in\r\nthe same volume, and published in 1851 (with six pages in facsimile), a\r\npalimpsest of 4000 lines of Homer’s Iliad not in the same hand as St.\r\nLuke, but quite as ancient. The fragments of St. Luke were independently\r\ntranscribed, with most laudable patience, both by Tregelles in 1854, and\r\nby Tischendorf in 1855, who afterwards re-examined the places wherein he\r\ndiffered from Tregelles (e.g. chh. viii. 5; xviii. 7, 10), and discovered\r\nby the aid of Dr. Wright a few more fragments of chh. vi-viii. Tischendorf\r\npublished an edition of Cod. R in his “Monumenta sacra inedita,” vol. ii,\r\nwith a facsimile: the amended readings, together with the newly-discovered\r\nvariations in chh. vi. 31-36, 39, vii. 44, 46, 47, are inserted in the\r\neighth edition of his Greek Testament. In this palimpsest as at present\r\nbound up in the Museum the fragments of St. Luke end on f. 48, and the\r\nrest of the Greek in the volume is in later, smaller, sloping uncials, and\r\ncontains propositions from the tenth and thirteenth books of Euclid. On\r\nthe critical character of the readings of this precious fragment we shall\r\nmake some comments below.\r\n\r\nS. CODEX VATICANUS 354 contains the four Gospels entire, and is amongst\r\nthe earliest dated manuscripts of the Greek Testament (p. 41, note 2).\r\nThis is a folio of 234 leaves, written in large oblong or compressed\r\nuncials: the Epistle to Carpianus and Eusebian canons are prefixed, and it\r\ncontains many later corrections (e.g. Luke viii. 15) and marginal notes\r\n(e.g. Matt. xxvii. 16, 17). Luke xxii. 43, 44; John v. 4; vii. 53-viii. 11\r\nare obelized. At the end we read ἐγράφει ἡ τιμία δέλτος αὕτη διὰ χειρὸς\r\nἐμοῦ Μιχαὴλ μοναχοῦ ἁμαρτωλοῦ μηνὶ μαρτίω α´. ἡμέρα ε´, ὡρα ϛ´, ἔτους\r\nςυνζ. ινδ. ζ´: i.e. A.D. 949. “Codicem bis diligenter contulimus,” says\r\nBirch: but collators in his day (1781-3) seldom noticed orthographical\r\nforms or stated where the readings _agree_ with the received text, so that\r\na more thorough examination was still required. Tregelles only inspected\r\nit, but Tischendorf, when at Rome in 1866, carefully re-examined it, and\r\nhas inserted many of its readings in his eighth edition and its\r\nsupplementary leaves. He states that Birch’s facsimile (consisting of the\r\nobelized John v. 4) is coarsely executed, while Bianchini’s is too\r\nelegant; he made another for himself.\r\n\r\nT. CODEX BORGIANUS I, now in the Propaganda at Rome (_see below_, Evan.\r\n180), contains thirteen or more quarto leaves of SS. Luke and John, with a\r\nThebaic or Sahidic version at their side, but on the opposite and left\r\npage. Each page consists of two columns: a single point indicates a break\r\nin the sense, but there are no other divisions. The fragment contains Luke\r\nxxii. 20-xxiii. 20; John vi. 28-67; vii. 6-viii. 31 (179 verses, since\r\nJohn vii. 53-viii. 11 are wanting). The portion containing St. John, both\r\nin Greek and Egyptian, was carefully edited at Rome in 1789 by A. A.\r\nGiorgi, an Augustinian Eremite; his facsimile, however (ch. vii. 35),\r\nseems somewhat rough, though Tischendorf (who has inspected the codex)\r\nsays that its uncials look as if written by a Copt, from their resemblance\r\nto Coptic letters(186): the shapes of _alpha_ and _iota_ are specially\r\nnoticeable. Birch had previously collated the Greek text. Notwithstanding\r\nthe occasional presence of the rough and smooth breathing in this copy (p.\r\n47)(187), Giorgi refers it to the fourth century, Tischendorf to the\r\nfifth. The Greek fragment of St. Luke was first collated by Mr. Bradley H.\r\nAlford, and inserted by his brother, Dean Alford, in the fourth edition of\r\nhis Greek Testament, vol. i (1859). Dr. Tregelles had drawn Mr. Alford’s\r\nattention to it, from a hint thrown out by Zoega, in p. 184 of his\r\n“Catalogus codd. Copt. MSS. qui in Museo Borgiano Velitris adservantur.”\r\nRomae, 1810.\r\n\r\nTs or Twoi is used by Tischendorf to indicate a few leaves in Greek and\r\nThebaic, which once belonged to Woide, and were published with his other\r\nThebaic fragments in Ford’s Appendix to the Codex Alexandrinus, Oxon.\r\n1799. They contain Luke xii. 15-xiii. 32; John viii. 33-42 (eighty-five\r\nverses). From the second fragment it plainly appears (what the similarity\r\nof the facsimiles had suggested to Tregelles) that T and Ts are parts of\r\nthe same manuscript, for the page of Ts which contains John viii. 33 in\r\nGreek exhibits on its reverse the Thebaic version of John viii. 23-32, of\r\nwhich T affords us only the Greek text. This fact was first noted by\r\nTischendorf (N. T. 1859), who adds that the Coptic scribe blundered much\r\nover the Greek: e.g. βαβουσα Luke xiii. 21; so δεκαι for δεκα και, ver.\r\n16. He transcribed T and Twoi (as well as Tb, Tc, Td, which we proceed to\r\ndescribe), for publication in the ninth volume of his “Monumenta sacra\r\ninedita” (1870), but owing to his death they never appeared. But Bp.\r\nLightfoot gives reasons (_see below_, vol. ii. c. 2) for thinking that\r\nthis fragment was not originally a portion of T.\r\n\r\nTb at St. Petersburg much resembles the preceding in the Coptic-like style\r\nof writing, but is not earlier than the sixth century. It contains on six\r\noctavo leaves John i. 25-42; ii. 9-iv. 50, spaces left in the text\r\nanswering the purpose of stops. Tb has a harmony of the Gospels at the\r\nfoot of the page.\r\n\r\nTc is a fragment of about twenty-one verses between Matt. xiv. 19 and xv.\r\n8, also of the sixth century, and at St. Petersburg, in the collection of\r\nBishop Porphyry. Its text in the twenty-nine places cited by Tischendorf\r\nin his eighth edition accords with Cod. א twenty-four times, with Cod. B\r\ntwenty times, with Codd. C and D sixteen times each, with Cod. 33 nine\r\ntimes. Cod. A is wanting here. Compared with these primary authorities\r\nseverally, it agrees with א alone once, with 33 alone twice, with אB\r\nunited against the rest four times: so that its critical character is very\r\ndecided.\r\n\r\nTd is a fragment of a Lectionary, Greek and Sahidic, of about the seventh\r\ncentury, found by Tischendorf in 1866 among the Borgian manuscripts at\r\nRome. It contains Matt. xvi. 13-20; Mark i. 3-8, xii. 35-37; John xix.\r\n23-27; xx. 30-31: twenty-four verses only. This fragment and the next have\r\nbeen brought into this place, rather than inserted in the list of\r\nEvangelistaria, because they both contained fragments of the Thebaic\r\nversion.\r\n\r\nTe is a fragment of St. Matthew at Cambridge (Univ. Libr. Addit. 1875).\r\nDr. Hort communicated its readings to Dr. C. R. Gregory, for his\r\nProlegomena to the eighth edition of Tischendorf’s N. T. It is “a tiny\r\nmorsel” of an uncial Lectionary of the sixth century, containing only\r\nMatt. iii. 13-16, the parallel column probably in the Thebaic version\r\nhaving perished. It was brought, among other Coptic fragments, from Upper\r\nEgypt by Mr. Greville Chester. Dr. Hort kindly enables me to add to his\r\ndescription of Te (Addenda to Tregelles’ N. T. p. 1070) that this “tiny\r\nmorsel” is irregular in shape, frequently less than four inches in width\r\nand height, the uncial Greek letters being three-eighths of an inch high.\r\nThere seem to have been two columns of either eight or more probably of\r\ntwenty-four lines each on a page, but no Coptic portions survive. “If of\r\ntwenty-four lines the fragment might belong to the inner column of a\r\nbilingual MS. with the two languages in parallel columns, or to the outer\r\ncolumn of a wholly Greek MS. or of a bilingual MS. with the section in the\r\ntwo languages consecutively, as in Mr. Horner’s Graeco-Thebaic fragment\r\n(Evst. 299: _see_ p. 398). In the latter case it might belong to the inner\r\ncolumn of a wholly Greek MS. or of a bilingual MS. with the section in two\r\nconsecutive languages. The size of the letters renders it improbable,\r\nhowever, that the columns were of eight lines only.” (Hort.)\r\n\r\nTf Horner. See below under Thebaic or Sahidic MSS. at the end.\r\n\r\nTg Cairo, Cod. Papadopulus Kerameus [vi or vii], 9-½ x 8-¼, ff. 3 (27),\r\ntwo cols., written in letters like Coptic.

CODEX NANIANUS I, so called from a former possessor, is now in the\r\nLibrary of St. Mark, Venice (I. viii). It contains the four Gospels\r\nentire, carefully and luxuriously written in two columns of twenty-one\r\nlines each on the quarto page, scarcely before the tenth century, although\r\nthe “letters are in general an imitation of those used before the\r\nintroduction of compressed uncials; but they do not belong to the age when\r\nfull and round writing was customary or natural, so that the stiffness and\r\nwant of ease is manifest” (Tregelles’ Horne, p. 202). It has _Carp._,\r\n_Eus. t._, κεφ. τ. τίτλ., κεφ., _pict._, with much gold ornament. Thus\r\nwhile the small ο in l. 1 of our facsimile (No. 22) is in the oldest\r\nstyle, the oblong _omicrons_ creep in at the end of lines 2 and 4. Münter\r\nsent some extracts from this copy to Birch, who used them for his edition,\r\nand states that the book contains the Eusebian canons. Accordingly in Mark\r\nv. 18, B (in error for H) stands under the proper section _μη_ (48).\r\nTischendorf in 1843 and Tregelles in 1846 collated Cod. U thoroughly and\r\nindependently, and compared their work at Leipsic for the purpose of\r\nmutual correction.\r\n\r\nV. CODEX MOSQUENSIS, of the Holy Synod, is known almost(188) exclusively\r\nfrom Matthaei’s Greek Testament: he states, no doubt most truly, that he\r\ncollated it “bis diligentissimè,” and gives a facsimile of it, assigning\r\nit to the eighth century. Judging from Matthaei’s plate, it is hard to say\r\nwhy others have dated it in the ninth. It contained in 1779, when first\r\ncollated, the Four Gospels in 8vo with the sections and Eusebian canons,\r\nin uncial letters down to John vii. 39, ουπω γαρ ην, and from that point\r\nin cursive letters of the thirteenth century, Matt. v. 44-vi. 12; ix.\r\n18-x. 1 being lost: when re-collated but four years later Matt. xxii.\r\n44-xxiii. 35; John xxi. 10-25 had disappeared. Matthaei tells us that the\r\nmanuscript is written in a kind of stichometry by a diligent scribe: its\r\nresemblance to Cod. M has been already mentioned. The cursive portion is\r\nMatthaei’s V, Scholz’s Evan. 250.\r\n\r\nWa. COD. REG. PARIS 314 consists of but two leaves at the end of another\r\nbook, containing Luke ix. 34-47; x. 12-22 (twenty-three verses). Its date\r\nis about the eighth century; the uncial letters are firmly written,\r\n_delta_ and _theta_ being of the ordinary oblong shape of that period.\r\nAccents and breathings are usually put; all the stops are expressed by a\r\nsingle point, whose position makes no difference in its power. This copy\r\nwas adapted to Church use, but is not an Evangelistarium, inasmuch as it\r\nexhibits the sections and Eusebian canons(189), and τίτλοι twice at the\r\nhead of the page. This fragment was brought to light by Scholz, and\r\npublished by Tischendorf, Monumenta sacra inedita, 1846.\r\n\r\nWb. Tischendorf considers the fragment at Naples he had formerly numbered\r\nR (2) as another portion of the same copy, and therefore indicates it in\r\nhis seventh edition of the N. T. (1859) as Wb. It has seventy-nine leaves,\r\nof which the fourteen last are palimpsest, is written in two columns, with\r\ntwenty-five lines in each page; has the Ammonian sections and lections,\r\nand contains Matt. xix. 14-28; xx. 23-xxi. 2; xxvi. 52-xxvii. 1; Mark\r\nxiii. 21-xiv. 67; Luke iii. 1-iv. 20. (Prolegomena to Tischendorf, p.\r\n395.)\r\n\r\nWc is assigned by Tischendorf to three leaves containing Mark ii. 8-16;\r\nLuke i. 20-32; 64-79 (thirty-five verses), which have been washed to make\r\na palimpsest, and the writing erased in parts by a knife. There are also\r\nsome traces of a Latin version, but all these were used up to bind other\r\nbooks in the library of St. Gall. They are of the eighth century, or the\r\nninth according to Tischendorf, edd. 7 and 8, and have appeared in vol.\r\niii of “Monumenta sacra inedita,” with a facsimile, whose style closely\r\nresembles that of Cod. Δ, and its kindred FG of St. Paul’s Epistles.\r\n\r\nWd was discovered in 1857 by Mr. W. White, sub-librarian of Trinity\r\nCollege, Cambridge, in the College Library, and was afterwards observed,\r\nand arranged by Mr. H. Bradshaw, University Librarian, its slips (about\r\ntwenty-seven in number) having been worked into the binding of a volume of\r\nGregory Nazianzen: they are now carefully arranged under glass (B. viii.\r\n5). They comprise portions of four leaves, severally containing Mark vii.\r\n3-4; 6-8; 30-36; 36-viii. 4; 4-10; 11-16; ix. 2; 7-9, in uncial letters of\r\nthe ninth century, if not rather earlier, slightly leaning to the right.\r\nThe sections are set in the margin without the Eusebian canons, with a\r\ntable of harmony at the foot of each page of twenty-four lines. The τίτλοι\r\nare in red at the top and bottom of the pages, their corresponding\r\nnumerals in the margin. The breathings and accents are often very faint:\r\nlessons and musical notes, crosses, &c. are in red, and sometimes cover\r\nthe original stops. In text it much resembles Codd. אBDLΔ: one reading\r\n(Mark vii. 33) appears to be unique. Dr. Scrivener has included it in a\r\nvolume of fresh collations of manuscripts and editions which is shortly to\r\nappear under the accomplished editorship of Mr. J. Rendel Harris.\r\n\r\nWe is a fragment containing John iv. 7-14, in three leaves, found by the\r\nVery Rev. G. W. Kitchin, Dean of Winchester, in Christ Church Library,\r\nwhen Tischendorf was at Oxford in 1865. It much resembles O at Moscow,\r\nand, like it, had a commentary annexed, to which there are numeral\r\nreferences set before each verse.\r\n\r\nWf is a palimpsest fragment of St. Matt. xxv. 31-36, and vi. 1-18\r\n(containing the doxology in the Lord’s Prayer), of about the ninth\r\ncentury, underlying Wake 13 at Christ Church, Oxford (Acts 192, Paul.\r\n246), discovered by the late Mr. A. A. Vansittart (Journal of Philology,\r\nvol. ii. no. 4, p. 241, note 1).\r\n\r\nX. CODEX MONACENSIS, in the University Library at Munich (No. 1/26), is a\r\nvaluable folio manuscript of the end of the ninth or early in the tenth\r\ncentury, containing the Four Gospels (in the order described above, with\r\nserious omissions)(190), and a commentary (chiefly from Chrysostom)\r\nsurrounding and interspersed with the text of all but St. Mark, in early\r\ncursive letters, not unlike (in Tischendorf’s judgement) the celebrated\r\nOxford Plato dated 895. The very elegant uncials of Cod. X “are small and\r\nupright; though some of them are compressed, they seem as if they were\r\n_partial_ imitations of those used in very early copies” (Tregelles’\r\nHorne, p. 195). Each page has two columns of about forty-five lines each.\r\nThere are no divisions by κεφάλαια or sections, nor notes to serve for\r\necclesiastical use. From a memorandum we find that it came from Rome to\r\nIngoldstadt, as a present from Gerard Vossius [1577-1649]; from\r\nIngoldstadt it was taken to Landshut in 1803, thence to Munich in 1827.\r\nWhen it was at Ingoldstadt Griesbach obtained some extracts from it\r\nthrough Dobrowsky; Scholz first collated it, but in his usual unhappy way;\r\nTischendorf in 1844, Tregelles in 1846. Dean Burgon examined it in 1872.\r\n\r\nY. CODEX BARBERINI 225 at Rome (in the Library founded by Cardinal\r\nBarberini in the seventeenth century) contains on six large leaves the 137\r\nverses John xvi. 3-xix. 41, of about the eighth century. Tischendorf\r\nobtained access to it in 1843 for a few hours, after some difficulty with\r\nthe Prince Barberini, and published it in his first instalment of\r\n“Monumenta sacra inedita,” 1846. Scholz had first noticed, and loosely\r\ncollated it. A later hand has coarsely retraced the letters, but the\r\nancient writing is plain and good. Accents and breathings are most often\r\nneglected or placed wrongly: κ θ τ [each with a small symbol after and\r\nbelow the character] are frequent at the end of lines. For punctuation\r\none, two, three or even four points are employed, the power of the single\r\npoint varying as in Codd. E Θa and B of the Apocalypse. The\r\npseudo-Ammonian sections are without the Eusebian canons: and such forms\r\nas λήμψεται xvi. 14, λήμψεσθε ver. 24 occur. These few uncial leaves are\r\nprefixed to a cursive copy of the Gospels with Theophylact’s commentary\r\n(Evan. 392): the text is mixed, and lies about midway between that of Cod.\r\nA and Cod. B.\r\n\r\nZ. CODEX DUBLINENSIS RESCRIPTUS, one of the chief palimpsests extant,\r\ncontains 295 verses of St. Matthew’s Gospel in twenty-two fragments(191).\r\nIt is of a small quarto size, originally 10-½ inches by 8, now reduced to\r\n8-¼ inches by 6, once containing 120 leaves arranged in quaternions, of\r\nwhich the first that remains bears the _signature_ 13 (ΙΓ): fourteen\r\nsheets or double leaves and four single leaves being all that survive. It\r\nwas discovered in 1787 by Dr. John Barrett, Senior Fellow of Trinity\r\nCollege, Dublin, under some cursive writing of the tenth century or later,\r\nconsisting of Chrysostom de Sacerdotio, extracts from Epiphanius, &c. In\r\nthe same volume are portions of Isaiah (eight leaves) and of Gregory\r\nNazianzen, in erased uncial letters, the latter not so ancient as the\r\nfragment of St. Matthew. All the thirty-two leaves of this Gospel that\r\nremain were engraved in copper-plate facsimile(192) at the expense of\r\nTrinity College, and published by Barrett in 1801, furnished with\r\nProlegomena, and the contents of each facsimile plate in modern Greek\r\ncharacters, on the opposite page. The facsimiles are not very accurate,\r\nand the form of the letters is stated to be less free and symmetrical than\r\nin the original: yet from these plates (for the want of a better guide)\r\nour alphabet (No. 6) and specimen (No. 18) have been taken. The Greek type\r\non the opposite page was not very well revised, and a comparison with the\r\ncopper-plate will occasionally convict it of errors, which have been\r\nanimadverted upon more severely than was quite necessary. The Prolegomena\r\nwere encumbered with a discussion of our Lord’s genealogies quite foreign\r\nto the subject, and the tone of scholarship is not very high; but\r\nBarrett’s judgement on the manuscript is correct in the main, and his\r\nconclusion, that it is as old as the sixth century, has been generally\r\nreceived. Tregelles in 1853 was permitted to apply a chemical mixture to\r\nthe vellum, which was already miserably discoloured, apparently from the\r\npurple dye: he was thus enabled to add a little (about 200 letters) to\r\nwhat Barrett had read long since(193), but he found that in most places\r\nwhich that editor had left blank, the vellum had been cut away or lost: it\r\nwould no doubt have been better for Barrett to have stated, in each\r\nparticular case, why he had been unable to give the text of the passage. A\r\nfar better edition of the manuscript, including the fragment of Isaiah,\r\nand a newly-discovered leaf of the Latin Codex Palatinus (_e_), with\r\nProlegomena and two plates of real facsimiles, was published in 1880 by T.\r\nK. Abbott, B.D., Professor of Biblical Greek in the University of Dublin.\r\nHe has read 400 letters hitherto deemed illegible, and is inclined to\r\nassign the fifth century as the date of the Codex. Codex Z, like many\r\nothers, and for the same orthographical reasons, has been referred to\r\nAlexandria as its native country. It is written with a single column on\r\neach page of twenty-one or twenty-three lines(194). The so-named Ammonian\r\nsections are given, but not the Eusebian canons: the τίτλοι are written at\r\nthe top of the pages by a later hand according to Porter and Abbott,\r\nthough this may be questioned (Gebhardt and Harnack’s “Texte,” &c., I. iv.\r\np. xxiii ff., 1883), their numbers being set in the margin. The writing is\r\ncontinuous, the _single_ point either rarely found or quite washed out:\r\nthe abbreviations are very few, and there are no breathings or accents.\r\nLike Cod. B, this manuscript indicates citations by > in the margin, and\r\nit represents N by —, but only at the end of a word and line. A space,\r\nproportionate to the occasion, is usually left when there is a break in\r\nthe sense, and capitals extend into the margin when a new section begins.\r\nThe letters are in a plain, steady, beautiful hand: they yield in elegance\r\nto none, and are never compressed at the end of a line. The shape of\r\n_alpha_ (which varies a good deal), and especially that of _mu_, is very\r\npeculiar: _phi_ is inordinately large: _delta_ has an upper curve which is\r\nnot usual: the same curves appear also in _zeta_, _lambda_, and _chi_. The\r\ncharacters are less in size than in N, about equal to those in R, much\r\ngreater than in AB. In regard to the text, it agrees much with Codd. אBD:\r\nwith Cod. A it has only twenty-three verses in common: yet in them A and Z\r\nvary fourteen times. Mr. Abbott adds that while אBZ stand together ten\r\ntimes against other uncials, BZ are never alone, but אZ against B often.\r\nIt is freer than either of them from transcriptural errors. Codd. אBCZ\r\ncombine less often than אBDZ. On examining Cod. Z throughout twenty-six\r\npages, he finds it alone thirteen times, differing from א thirty times,\r\nfrom B forty-four times, from Stephen’s text ninety-five times. Thus it\r\napproaches nearer to א than to B.\r\n\r\nΓ. CODEX TISCHENDORFIAN. IV was brought by Tischendorf from an “eastern\r\nmonastery” (he usually describes the locality of his manuscripts in such\r\nlike general terms), and was bought of him for the Bodleian Library (Misc.\r\nGr. 313) in 1855. It consists of 158 leaves, 12 inches x 9-¼, with one\r\ncolumn (of twenty-four not very straight or regular lines) on a page, in\r\nuncials of the ninth century, leaning slightly back, but otherwise much\r\nresembling Cod. K in style (facsimile No. 35). St. Luke’s Gospel is\r\ncomplete; the last ten leaves are hurt by damp, though still legible. In\r\nSt. Mark only 105 verses are wanting (iii. 35-vi. 20); about 531 verses of\r\nthe other Gospels survive(195). Tischendorf, and Tregelles by his leave,\r\nhave independently collated this copy, of which Tischendorf gives a\r\nfacsimile in his “Anecdota sacra et profana,” 1855. Some of its peculiar\r\nreadings are very notable, and few uncials of its date deserve that more\r\ncareful study, which it has hardly yet received. In 1859 Tischendorf, on\r\nhis return from his third Eastern journey, took to St. Petersburg\r\nninety-nine additional leaves of this self-same manuscript, doubtless\r\nprocured from the same place as he had obtained the Bodleian portion six\r\nyears before (Notitia Cod. Sinait. p. 53). This copy of the Gospels,\r\nthough unfortunately in two distant libraries, is now nearly perfect(196),\r\nand at the end of St. John’s Gospel, in the more recently discovered\r\nportion, we find an inscription which seems to fix the date: ετελειωθη ἡ\r\nδέλτος αὔτη μηνι νοεμβριω _κζ_, ινδ. _η_, ἡμερα _ε_, ωρα _β_. Tischendorf,\r\nby the aid of Ant. Pilgrami’s “Calendarium chronologum medii potissimum\r\naevi monumentis accommodatum,” Vienn. 1781, pp. vii, 11, 105, states that\r\nthe only year between A.D. 800 and 950, on which the Indiction was eight,\r\nand Nov. 27 fell on a Thursday, was 844(197). In the Oxford sheets we find\r\ntables of κεφάλαια before the Gospels of SS. Matthew and Luke; the τίτλοι\r\nat the heading of the pages; their numbers _rubro_ neatly set in the\r\nmargin; capitals in red at the commencement of these chapters; the ἀρχαὶ\r\nκαὶ τέλη of lections; the sections and Eusebian canons in their usual\r\nplaces, and some liturgical directions. Over the original breathings and\r\naccents some late scrawler has in many places put others, in a very\r\ncareless fashion.\r\n\r\nΔ. CODEX SANGALLENSIS, was first inspected by Gerbert (1773), named by\r\nScholz (N. T. 1830), and made fully known to us by the admirable edition\r\nin lithographed facsimile of every page, by H. Ch. M. Rettig [1799-1836],\r\npublished at Zurich, 1836(198), with copious and satisfactory Prolegomena.\r\nIt is preserved and was probably transcribed a thousand years since in the\r\ngreat monastery of St. Gall in the north-east of Switzerland (Stifts\r\nbibliothek, 48). It is rudely written on 197 leaves of coarse vellum\r\nquarto, 8-7/8 inches by 7-1/8 in size, with from twenty to twenty-six\r\n(usually twenty-one) lines on each page, in a very peculiar hand, with an\r\ninterlinear Latin version, and contains the four Gospels complete except\r\nJohn xix. 17-35. Before St. Matthew’s Gospel are placed Prologues, Latin\r\nverses, the Eusebian canons in Roman letters, tables of the κεφάλαια both\r\nin Greek and Latin, &c. Rettig thinks he has traced several different\r\nscribes and inks employed on it, which might happen easily enough in the\r\nScriptorium of a monastery; but, if so, their style of writing is very\r\nnearly the same, and they doubtless copied from the same archetype, about\r\nthe same time. He has produced more convincing arguments to show that Cod.\r\nΔ is part of the same book as the Codex Boernerianus, G of St. Paul’s\r\nEpistles. Not only do they exactly resemble each other in their whole\r\narrangement and appearance, but marginal notes by the first hand are found\r\nin each, of precisely the same character. Thus the predestinarian\r\ndoctrines of the heretic Godeschalk [d. 866] are pointed out for\r\nrefutation at the hard texts, Luke xiii. 24; John xii. 40 in Δ, and six\r\ntimes in G(199). St. Mark’s Gospel represents a text different from that\r\nof the other Evangelists, and the Latin version (which is clearly _primâ\r\nmanu_) seems a mixture of the Vulgate with the older Italic, so altered\r\nand accommodated to the Greek as to be of little critical value. The\r\npenmen seem to have known but little Greek, and to have copied from a\r\nmanuscript written continuously, for the divisions between the words are\r\nsometimes absurdly wrong. There are scarcely any breathings or accents,\r\nexcept about the opening of St. Mark, and once an aspirate to ἑπτα; what\r\nwe do find are often falsely given; and a dot is set in most places\r\nregularly at the end of every _Greek_ word. The letters have but little\r\ntendency to the oblong shape, but _delta_ and _theta_ are decidedly of the\r\nlatest uncial type. Here, as in Paul. Cod. G, the mark >>> is much used to\r\nfill up vacant spaces. The text from which Δ was copied seems to have been\r\narranged in στίχοι, for almost every line has at least one Greek capital\r\nletter, grotesquely ornamental in colours(200). We transcribe three lines,\r\ntaken almost at random, from pp. 80-1 (Matt. xx. 13-15), in order to\r\nexplain our meaning:\r\n\r\ndixit uni eo_r_ amice non _ij_usto tibi _nn_e\r\nειπεν; μοναδι; αυτων; Εταιρε; ουκ; αδικω; σε; Ουχι\r\nex denario convenisti mecū tolle tuū et vade\r\nδηναριου συνεφωνησασ; μοι; Αρον; το; σον και υπαγε\r\nvolo autē huic novissimo dare sicut et tibi antā non li\r\nΘελω δε τουτω τω εσχατω δουναι ωσ και; σοι; Η; ουκ εξ\r\n\r\nIt will be observed that, while in Cod. Δ a line begins at any place, even\r\nin the middle of a word; if the capital letters be assumed to commence the\r\nlines, the text divides itself into regular στίχοι. See above, pp. 52-54.\r\nHere are also the τίτλοι, the sections and canons. The letters Ν and ι, Ζ\r\nand Ξ, Τ and Θ, Ρ and the Latin R are perpetually confounded. Facsimiles\r\nof Luke i. 1-9 may be seen in Pal. Soc. xi. 179. As in the kindred Codd.\r\nAugiensis and Boernerianus the Latin f is much like r. Tregelles has noted\r\nι ascript in Cod. Δ, but this is rare. There is no question that this\r\ndocument was written by Latin (most probably by Irish) monks, in the west\r\nof Europe, during the ninth century (or the tenth, Pal. Soc.).  _See\r\nbelow_, Paul. Cod. G.\r\n\r\nΘa. CODEX TISCHENDORFIAN. I was brought from the East by Tischendorf in\r\n1845, published by him in his “Monumenta sacra inedita,” 1846, with a few\r\nsupplements in vol. ii of his new collection (1857), and deposited in the\r\nUniversity Library at Leipsic. It consists of but four leaves (all\r\nimperfect) quarto, of very thin vellum, almost too brittle to be touched,\r\nso that each leaf is kept separately in glass. It contains about forty-two\r\nverses; viz. Matt. xii. 17-19; 23-25; xiii. 46-55 (in mere shreds); xiv.\r\n8-29; xv. 4-14, with the greater κεφάλαια in red; the sections and\r\nEusebian canons stand in the inner margin. A few breathings are _primâ\r\nmanu_, and many accents by two later correctors. The stops (which are\r\nrather numerous) resemble those of Cod. Y, only that four points are not\r\nfound in Θa. Tischendorf places its date towards the end of the seventh\r\ncentury, assigning Mount Sinai or lower Egypt for its country. The uncials\r\n(especially ΕΘΟΣ) are somewhat oblong, leaning to the right (_see_ p. 41\r\nnote), but the writing is elegant and uniform; _delta_ keeps its ancient\r\nshape, and the diameter of _theta_ does not extend beyond the curve. In\r\nregard to the text, it much resembles אB, and stands alone with them in\r\nch. xiv. 12 (αὐτόν).\r\n\r\nSeven other small fragments, of which four and part of another are from\r\nthe manuscripts of Bishop Porphyry at St. Petersburg, were intended to be\r\nincluded in Tischendorf’s ninth volume of “Monumenta sacra inedita”\r\n(1870), but owing to Tischendorf’s death they never appeared. That active\r\ncritic had brought two (Θb, d) and part of another (Θc) from the East, and\r\ndeposited them in the Library at St. Petersburg. They are described by him\r\nas follows:\r\n\r\nΘb, six leaves in large 8vo, of the sixth or seventh century, torn\r\npiecemeal for binding and hard to decipher, contains Matt. xxii. 16-xxiii.\r\n13; Mark iv. 24-35; v. 14-23.\r\n\r\nΘc, one folio leaf, of the sixth century, much like Cod. N, contains Matt.\r\nxxi. 19-24. Another leaf contains John xviii. 29-35.\r\n\r\nΘd, half a leaf in two columns, of the seventh or eighth century, with\r\naccents by a later hand, contains Luke xi. 37-41; 42-45.\r\n\r\nΘe, containing fragments of Matt. xxvi. 2-4; 7-9: Θf, of Matt. xxvi.\r\n59-70; xxvii. 44-56; Mark i. 34-ii. 12 (not continuously throughout): Θg\r\nof John vi. 13, 14; 22-24; are all of about the sixth century.\r\n\r\nΘh, consisting of three leaves, in Greek and Arabic of the ninth or tenth\r\ncenturies, contains imperfect portions of Matt. xiv. 6-13; xxv. 9-16;\r\n41-xxvi. 1.\r\n\r\nΛ. CODEX TISCHENDORFIAN. III(201), whose history, so far as we know it,\r\nexactly resembles that of Cod. Γ, and like it is now in the Bodleian\r\n(Auct. T. Infra I. 1). It contains 157 leaves, written in two columns of\r\ntwenty-three lines each, in small, oblong, clumsy, sloping uncials of the\r\neighth or rather of the ninth century (_see_ p. 41, note 1, and facsimile\r\nNo. 30). It has the Gospels of St. Luke and St. John complete, with the\r\nsubscription to St. Mark, each Gospel being preceded by tables of\r\nκεφάλαια, with the τίτλοι at the heads of the pages; the numbers of the\r\nκεφάλαια, of the sections, and of the Eusebian canons (these last _rubro_)\r\nbeing set in the margin. There are also scholia interspersed, of some\r\ncritical value; a portion being in uncial characters. This copy also was\r\ndescribed (with a facsimile) by Tischendorf, Anecdota sacra et profana,\r\n1855, and collated by himself and Tregelles. Its text is said to vary\r\ngreatly from that common in the later uncials, and to be very like\r\nScholz’s 262 (Paris 53). For ι _ascriptum_ see p. 44, note 2.\r\n\r\nHere again the history of this manuscript curiously coincides with that of\r\nCod. Γ. In his Notitia Cod. Sinaitici, p. 58, Tischendorf describes an\r\nearly cursive copy of St. Matthew and St. Mark (_the subscription to the\r\nlatter being wanting_), which he took to St. Petersburg in 1859, so\r\nexactly corresponding in general appearance with Cod. Λ (although that be\r\nwritten in uncial characters), as well as in the style and character of\r\nthe marginal scholia, which are often in small uncials, that he pronounces\r\nthem part of the same codex. Very possibly he _might_ have added that he\r\nprocured the two from the same source: at any rate the subscription to St.\r\nMatthew at St. Petersburg precisely resembles the other three\r\nsubscriptions at Oxford, and those in Paris 53 (Scholz’s 262)(202), with\r\nwhich Tischendorf had previously compared Cod. Λ (N. T. Proleg. p.\r\nclxxvii, seventh edition). These cursive leaves are preceded by Eusebius’\r\nEpistle to Carpianus, his table of canons, and a table of the κεφάλαια of\r\nSt. Matthew. The τίτλοι in uncials head the pages, and their numbers stand\r\nin the margin.\r\n\r\nFrom the marginal scholia Tischendorf cites the following notices of the\r\nJewish Gospel, or that according to the Hebrews, which certainly have\r\ntheir value as helping to inform us respecting its nature: Matt. iv. 5 το\r\nιουδαικον ουκ εχει εις την αγιαν πολιν αλλ εν _ιλημ_. xvi. 17 Βαριωνα; το\r\nιουδαικον υιε ιωαννου. xviii. 22 το ιουδαικον εξης εχει μετα το\r\nἑβδομηκοντακις ἑπτα; και γαρ εν τοις προφηταις μετα το χρισθηναι αυτους εν\r\n_πνι_ ἁγιω εὑρισκετω (_sic_) εν αυτοις λογος ἁμαρτιας:—an addition which\r\nJerome (contra Pelag. III) expressly cites from the Gospel of the\r\nNazarenes. xxvi. 47 το ιουδαικον; και ηρνησατο και ωμοσεν και κατηρασατο.\r\nIt is plain that this whole matter requires careful discussion, but at\r\npresent it would seem that the first half of Cod. Λ was written in\r\ncursive, the second in uncial letters; if not by the same person, yet on\r\nthe same plan and at the same place.\r\n\r\nΞ. CODEX ZACYNTHIUS is a palimpsest in the Library of the British and\r\nForeign Bible Society in London, which, under a cursive Evangelistarium\r\nwritten on coarse vellum in or about the thirteenth century, contains\r\nlarge portions (342 verses) of St. Luke, down to ch. xi. 33(203), in full\r\nwell-formed uncials, but surrounded by and often interwoven with large\r\nextracts from the Fathers, in a hand so cramped and, as regards the round\r\nletters (ΕΘΟΣ), so oblong, that it cannot be earlier than the eighth\r\ncentury, although some such compressed forms occur in Cod. P of the sixth\r\n(_see_ p. 144). The general absence of accents and breathings also would\r\nfavour an earlier date. As the arrangement of the matter makes it certain\r\nthat the commentary is contemporaneous, Cod. Ξ must be regarded as the\r\nearliest known, indeed as the only uncial, copy furnished with a catena.\r\nThis volume, which once belonged to “Il Principe Comuto, Zante,” and is\r\nmarked as Μνημόσυνον σεβάσματος τοῦ Ἱππέος Ἀντωνίου Κόμητος 1820, was\r\npresented to the Bible Society in 1821 by General Macaulay, who brought it\r\nfrom Zante. Mr. Knolleke, one of the Secretaries, seems first to have\r\nnoticed the older writing, and on the discovery being communicated to\r\nTregelles in 1858 by Dr. Paul de Lagarde of Berlin, with characteristic\r\neagerness that critic examined, deciphered, and published the Scripture\r\ntext, together with the Moscow fragment O, in 1861: he doubted whether the\r\nsmall Patristic writing could all be read without chemical restoration.\r\nBesides the usual τίτλοι above the text and other notations of sections,\r\nand numbers running up from 1 to 100 which refer to the catena, this copy\r\nis remarkable for possessing also the division into chapters, hitherto as\r\nhas been stated deemed unique in Cod. B. To this notation is commonly\r\nprefixed _psi_, formed like a cross, in the fashion of the eighth century.\r\nThe ancient volume must have been a large folio (14 inches by 11), of\r\nwhich eighty-six leaves and three half-leaves survive: of course very hard\r\nto read. Of the ecclesiastical writers cited by name Chrysostom, Origen,\r\nand Cyril are the best known.  In text it generally favours the B and א\r\nand their company. In the 564 places wherein Tischendorf cites it in his\r\neighth edition, it supports Cod. L in full three cases out of four, and\r\nthose the most characteristic. It stands alone only fourteen times, and\r\nwith Cod. L or others against the five great uncials only thirty times. In\r\nregard to these five, Cod. Ξ sides plainly with Cod. B in preference to\r\nCod. A, following B alone seven times, BL twenty-four times, but א\r\nthirteen times, A fifteen times, C (which is often defective) five times,\r\nD fourteen times, with none of these unsupported except with א once. Their\r\ncombinations in agreement with Ξ are curious and complicated, but lead to\r\nthe same result.  This copy is with אB six times, with אBL fifty-five;\r\nwith אBC twenty, but with אBD as many as fifty-four times, with אBCD\r\nthirty-eight times; with BCD thrice, with BC six times, with BD thirteen.\r\nIt combines with אA ten times, with AC fifteen, with AD eleven, with אAC\r\nsixteen, with ACD twelve, with אAD six, with אACD twelve. Thus Cod. Ξ\r\nfavours B against A 226 times, A against B ninety-seven. Combinations of\r\nits readings opposed to both A and B are אC six, אD eight, CD two, אCD\r\nthree. In the other passages it favours ABC against אD eleven times, ABCD\r\nagainst א eight times, אABC against D eighteen times, אABD against C, or\r\nwhere C is defective, thirty-nine times, and is expressly cited\r\ntwenty-seven times as standing with אABCD against later copies. The\r\ncharacter of the variations of Cod. Ξ from the Received text may be judged\r\nof by the estimate made by some scholar, that forty-seven of them are\r\ntranspositions in the order of the words, 201 are substitutions of one\r\nword for another, 118 are omissions, while the additions do not exceed\r\ntwenty-four (_Christian Remembrancer_, January, 1862). The cursive\r\nEvangelistarium written over the uncial is noticed below, and bears the\r\nmark 200*.\r\n\r\nΠ. CODEX PETROPOLITANUS consists of 350 vellum leaves in small quarto, and\r\ncontains the Gospels complete except Matt. iii. 12-iv. 18; xix. 12-xx. 3;\r\nJohn viii. 6-39; seventy-seven verses. A century since it belonged to\r\nParodus, a noble Greek of Smyrna, and its last possessor was persuaded by\r\nTischendorf, in 1859, to present it to the Emperor of Russia. Tischendorf\r\nstates that it is of the age of the later uncials (meaning the ninth\r\ncentury), but of higher critical importance than most of them, and much\r\nlike Cod. K in its rarer readings. There are many marginal and other\r\ncorrections by a later hand, and John v. 4; viii. 3-6 are obelized. In the\r\ntable of κεφάλαια before St. Mark, there is a gap after _λϛ_: Mark xvi.\r\n18-20; John xxi. 22-25 are in a later hand. At the end of St. Mark, the\r\nlast section inserted is _σλδ_ by the side of ἀναστὰς δέ ver. 9, with _η_\r\nunder it for the Eusebian canon. Tischendorf first used its readings for\r\nhis Synopsis Evangelica 1864, then for the eighth edition of his Greek\r\nTestament 1865, &c. This manuscript in the great majority of instances\r\nsides with the later uncials (whether supported by Cod. A or not) against\r\nCodd. אBCD united.\r\n\r\nΣ. COD. ROSSANENSIS, like Cod. N described above, is a manuscript written\r\non thin vellum leaves stained purple, in silver letters, the first three\r\nlines of each Gospel being in gold. Like Cod. D it probably dates from the\r\nsixth century, if not a little sooner, and is the earliest known copy of\r\nScripture which is adorned with miniatures in watercolours, seventeen in\r\nnumber, very interesting and in good preservation. The illustrated\r\nDioscorides at Vienna bears about the same date. Attention was called to\r\nthe book by Cesare Malpica in 1846, but it was not seen by any one who\r\ncared to use it before March, 1879, when Oscar von Gebhardt of Göttingen\r\nand Adolf Harnack of Giessen, in their search for codices of Hippolytus,\r\nof Dionysius of Alexandria, and of Cyril of Jerusalem, described by\r\nCardinal Sirlet in 1582, found it in the Archbishop’s Library at Rossano,\r\na small city in Calabria, and published an account of it in 1880 in a\r\nsumptuous form, far more satisfactory to the artist than to the Biblical\r\ncritic. Their volume is illustrated by two facsimile leaves, of one of\r\nwhich a reduction may be seen in our Plate xiv, No. 43. A copy of the\r\nmanuscripts was published at Leipsic in 1883 with an Introduction by Oscar\r\nvon Gebhardt, the Text being edited by Adolf Harnack(204). The page we\r\nhave exhibited gives the earliest MS. authority, except Φ, for the\r\ndoxology in the Lord’s Prayer, Matt. vi. 13. The manuscript is in quarto,\r\n13-½ inches high by 10-¼ broad, and now contains only the Gospels of St.\r\nMatthew and St. Mark on 188 leaves of two columns each, there being twenty\r\nlines in each column of very regular writing, and from nine to twelve\r\nletters in each line. It ends abruptly at Mark xvi. 14, and the last ten\r\nleaves have suffered from damp; otherwise the writing (especially on the\r\ninner or smooth side of the vellum) is in good preservation, and the\r\ncolours of the paintings wonderfully fresh. The binding is of strong black\r\nleather, about 200 years old. As in Cod. B, the sheets are ranged in\r\nquinions, the _signatures_ in silver by the original scribe standing at\r\nthe lower border of each quire on the right, and the pages being marked in\r\nthe upper border in modern black ink. In Cod. Σ there is no separation\r\nbetween the words, it has no breathings or accents. Capital letters stand\r\noutside the columns, being about twice the size of the rest, and the\r\nsmaller letters at the end of lines are not compressed, as we find them\r\neven in Cod. P (_see_ pp. 144, 163). The letters are round and square,\r\nand, as was abundantly seen above (pp. 33-40), belong to the older type of\r\nwriting. The punctuation is very simple: the full stop occurs half up the\r\nletter. There are few erasures, but transcriptural errors are mostly\r\ncorrected in silver letters by the original scribe. To St. Matthew’s\r\nGospel is prefixed Eusebius’ Epistle to Carpianus and his Tables of\r\nCanons, both imperfect; also lists of the κεφάλαια _majora_ and τίτλοι in\r\nthe upper margins of the several leaves, with a subscription to the first\r\nGospel (Ευαγγελιον κατα ματθαιον). This supplementary matter is written\r\nsomewhat smaller, but (as the editors judge) by the same hand as the text,\r\nalthough the letters are somewhat more recent in general appearance, and ι\r\n_ascriptum_ occurs, as it never does in the body of the manuscript:\r\n[symbol] also is only twice abridged in the text, but often in the smaller\r\nwriting. In the margin of the Greek text the Ammonian sections stand in\r\nminute characters over the numbers of the Eusebian canons. The text agrees\r\nbut slightly with א or B, and rather with the main body of uncials and\r\ncursives, which it favours in about a proportion of three to one. With the\r\ncognate purple manuscript Cod. N it accords so wonderfully, that although\r\none of them cannot have been copied directly from the other, they must\r\nhave been drawn directly or indirectly from the same source. Strong proofs\r\nof the affinity between N and Σ are Matt. xix. 7 ἡμῖν added to ἐνετείλατο:\r\nxxi. 8 ἐκ (for ἀπό): Mark vi. 53 ἐκεῖ added to προσω(ο in Σ)ρμισθησαν:\r\nvii. 1 οἱ prefixed to ἐλθόντες: _ibid._ 29 ὁ ἰ_σ_  added to εἶπεν αὐτῇ:\r\nviii. 3 ἐγλυθήσονται: _ibid._ 13 καταλιπών for ἀφείς: _ibid._ 18 οὔπω\r\nνοεῖτε for καὶ οὐ μνημονεύετε: ix. 3 λευκᾶναι οὕτως: x. 5 ἐπέτρεψεν for\r\nἔγραψεν: xiv. 36 πλήν before ἀλλ᾽: xv. 21 omit παράγοντα: in all which\r\nplaces the two manuscripts are either virtually or entirely alone.\r\nGenerally speaking, the Codex Rossanensis follows the Traditional Text,\r\nbut not invariably. We find here the usual itacisms, as ει for ι, αι for\r\nε, η for ει and ι, ου for ω, and vice versa; even ο for ω, which is rarer\r\nin very ancient copies. The so-called Alexandrian forms ἤλθατε, ἐλθάτω,\r\nἴδαμεν, ἴδαν for verbs, τρίχαν and νύκταν for nouns, ἐκαθερίσθη, λήμψομαι,\r\nδεκατέσσερες, τεσσεράκοντα, it has in common with all copies approaching\r\nit in age.\r\n\r\nΥ. CODEX BLENHEIMIUS. Brit. Mus. Additional 31919, formerly Blenheim 3. D.\r\n13, purchased at Puttick’s from the Sunderland sale in April, 1882. Under\r\na Menaeum (_see_ our Evst. 282) for the twenty-eight days of February\r\n[A.D. 1431], 12-7/8 x 8-1/8, containing 108 leaves, Professors T. K.\r\nAbbott and J. P. Mahaffy of Trinity College, Dublin, discovered at\r\nBlenheim in May, 1881, _palimpsest_ fragments of the Gospels of the eighth\r\ncentury, being seventeen passages scattered over thirty-three of the\r\nleaves: viz. Matt. i. 1-14; v. 3-19; xii. 27-41; xxiii. 5-xxv. 30;\r\n43-xxvi. 26; 50-xxvii. 17. Mark i. 1-42; ii. 21-v. 1; 29-vi. 22; x. 50-xi.\r\n13. Luke xvi. 21-xvii. 3; 19-37; xix. 15-31. John ii. 18-iii. 5; iv.\r\n23-37; v. 35-vi. 2: in all 484 verses. In 1883, Dr. Gregory discovered two\r\nmore leaves, making thirty-six in all, with a reduction of the passages to\r\nsixteen by filling up an hiatus, and giving a total of 497 verses. It is\r\nprobable that writing lies under all the 108 leaves. It exhibits _Am._\r\n(not _Eus._) in gold, ἀρχαί and τέλη, but is very hard to read, and has\r\nnot yet been collated. Of less account are palimpsest pieces of the\r\neleventh century on some of the leaves, containing Matt. xi. 13, &c.; Luke\r\ni. 64, &c.; ii. 25-34, and a later cursive patch (fol. 23) containing Mark\r\nvi. 14-20.\r\n\r\nΦ. CODEX BERATINUS. This symbol was taken by Herr Oscar von Gebhardt to\r\ndenote the imaginary parent of Cursives 13, 69, 124, 346, of which the\r\nsimilarity has been traced by the late W. H. Ferrar and Dr. T. K. Abbott\r\nin “A Collection of Four Important MSS.” (1877). But it is now permanently\r\naffixed to an Uncial MS. seen by M. Pierre Batiffol on the instigation of\r\nProf. Duchesne in 1875 at Berat or Belgrade in Albania. This manuscript\r\nhad been previously described by Mgr. Anthymus Alexoudi, Orthodox\r\nMetropolitan of Belgrade, in an account of his diocese published in 1868\r\nin Corfu. According to M. Batiffol, it is a purple manuscript, written in\r\nsilver letters on vellum, an _édition de grande luxe_, and therefore open\r\nto the charge brought by St. Jerome in his Prolegomena to Job against the\r\ngreat adornment of manuscripts, as being far from constituting an index of\r\naccuracy. It contains 190 unpaged leaves in quaternions, firmly sewn\r\ntogether, having two columns in a page of seventeen lines each, and from\r\neight to twelve words in a line. The leaves are in size about 12-¼ inches\r\nby 10-½, and the columns measure 8-¼ inches high by rather more than 4-¼\r\nbroad. The pages have the κεφάλαια marked at the top, and the sections and\r\ncanons in writing of the eighth century at the side. The letters are in\r\nsilver, very regular, and clearly written. None are in gold, except the\r\ntitle and the first line in St. Mark, and the words Πατήρ, Ἰησοῦς, and\r\nsome others in the first six folios. There is no ornamentation, but the\r\nfirst letters of paragraphs are twice as large as the other letters. The\r\nletters have no decoration, except a cross in the middle of the initial\r\nO’s. The writing is continuous in full line without stichometry.\r\nQuotations from the Old Testament are marked with a kind of inverted\r\ncomma. There are no breathings, or accents. Punctuation is made only with\r\nthe single comma or double comma, consisting of a point slightly elongated\r\nmuch like a modern written comma, and placed at about mid-height, or else\r\nwith a vacant space, or by passing to the next line. The apostrophe is not\r\nalways used to mark elisions, but is generally put after Ρ final.\r\nAbbreviations are of the most ancient kind. The character of the letters\r\nmay be seen in the specimen given above, No. 43. Altogether, the Codex\r\nBeratinus (Φ) may probably be placed at the end of the fifth century, a\r\nlittle before the Dioscorides (506 A.D.), and before the Codex\r\nRossanensis.\r\n\r\nAs to the character of the text, it inclines to the large body of Uncials\r\nand Cursives, and is rarely found with Bא and Z of St. Matthew or Δ of St.\r\nMark. A specimen examination of fifty passages at the beginning of St.\r\nMatthew gives forty-four instances in which it agrees with the larger body\r\nof Uncials and Cursives, six when it passes over to the other side, whilst\r\nin thirty-eight it agrees with Σ. In the same passages, Σ agrees\r\nthirty-eight times with the larger body, and twelve times with א or B.\r\nLike Σ it contains the doxology in Matt. vi. 13.\r\n\r\nCodex Φ has gone through many vicissitudes. It has perhaps been at Patmos,\r\nwhere it may have been mutilated by some of the Crusaders, and at Antioch.\r\nIt contains only St. Matthew and St. Mark; a note says that the\r\ndisappearance of St. Luke and St. John is due to the Franks of Champagne.\r\nThe first six folios are in a bad state, so that the text as we have it\r\ndoes not begin till St. Matt. vi. 3 η αριστερα σου κ.τ.λ. Hiatus occurs\r\nMatt. vii. 26-viii. 7, in xviii. 23-xix. 3, and in Mark xiv. 62-fin. So\r\nthat Cod. Φ presents no direct evidence—only the testimony to the general\r\ncharacter of its companions derived from its own character and general\r\ncoincidence—upon the last twelve verses of St. Mark. Part of folio 112, at\r\nthe end of St. Matthew, is blank, and folios 113, 114, contain the\r\nκεφάλαια of St. Mark.\r\n\r\nIt was handsomely bound in 1805 in wood covered with chased silver.\r\n\r\nΨ.

CODEX LAUDIANUS 35 is one of the most precious treasures preserved in\r\nthe Bodleian at Oxford. It is a Latin-Greek copy, with two columns on a\r\npage, the Latin version holding the post of honour on the left, and is\r\nwritten in very short στίχοι consisting of from one to three words each,\r\nthe Latin words always standing opposite to the corresponding Greek. This\r\npeculiar arrangement points decisively to the West of Europe as its\r\ncountry, notwithstanding the abundance of Alexandrian forms has led some\r\nto refer it to Egypt. The very large, bold, thick, rude uncials, without\r\nbreak in the words and without accents, lead us up to the end of the sixth\r\ncentury as its date. The Latin is not of Jerome’s or the Vulgate version,\r\nbut is made to correspond closely with the Greek, even in its\r\ninterpolations and rarest various readings. The contrary supposition that\r\nthe Greek portion of this codex _Latinised_, or had been altered to\r\ncoincide with the Latin, is inconsistent with the facts of the case. This\r\nmanuscript contains only the Acts of the Apostles (from ch. xxvi. 29\r\nπαυλος to ch. xxviii. 26 λέγον being lost), and exhibits a remarkable\r\nmodification of the text, of which we shall speak in Chapter VII. That the\r\nbook was once in Sardinia, appears from an edict of Flavius Pancratius,\r\nσυν θεω απο επαρχων δουξ σαρδινιας, appended (as also is the Apostles’\r\nCreed in Latin, and some other foreign matter) in a later hand: Imperial\r\ngovernors ruled in that island with the title of _dux_ from the reign of\r\nJustinian, A.D. 534 to A.D. 749. It was probably among the Greek volumes\r\nbrought into England by the fellow-countryman of St. Paul, Theodore of\r\nTarsus(205), “the grand old man” as he has been called by one of kindred\r\nspirit to his own (Dean Hook, Lives of the Archbishops of Canterbury, vol.\r\ni. p. 150), who came to England as Primate at the age of sixty-six, A.D.\r\n668, and died in 690. At all events, Mill (N. T. Proleg. §§ 1022-6)(206)\r\nhas rendered it all but certain, that the Venerable Bede [d. 735] had this\r\nvery codex before him when he wrote his “Expositio Retractata” of the\r\nActs(207), and Woide (Notitia Cod. Alex., p. 156, &c.) has since alleged\r\nsix additional instances of agreement between them. The manuscript,\r\nhowever, must have been complete when Bede used it, for he cites in the\r\nLatin ch. xxvii. 5; xxviii. 2. Tischendorf (Proleg. p. xv) adds ch. xxvii.\r\n1, 7, 14, 15, 16, 17: but these last instances are somewhat uncertain.\r\nThis manuscript, with many others, was presented to the University of\r\nOxford in the year 1636, by its munificent Chancellor, Archbishop Laud.\r\nThomas Hearne, the celebrated antiquary, published a full edition of it in\r\n1715, which is now very scarce, and was long known to be far from\r\naccurate. Sabatier in 1751 gave the Latin of it taken from Hearne.\r\nTischendorf has published a new edition, from two separate collations made\r\nby himself in 1854 and 1865, in the ninth volume by way of Appendix to his\r\n“Monumenta sacra inedita,” 1870. It is also found in vol. ii of Hansell’s\r\nedition of the Ancient Texts, published at the Clarendon Press in 1864.\r\nCod. E has been stated to have capital letters at the commencement of each\r\nof the Euthalian sections, but as the capitals occur at other places where\r\nthe sense is broken but slightly (e.g. ch. xvii. 20), this circumstance\r\ndoes not prove that those sections were known to the scribe. It is in size\r\n10-¼ inches by 8-½, and consists of 227 leaves of twenty-three,\r\ntwenty-four, twenty-five, or twenty-six lines each; about fifteen leaves\r\nare lost: the vellum is rather coarse in quality, and the ink in many\r\nplaces very faint. There seem to be no stops nor breathings, except an\r\naspirate over initial _upsilon_ ([symbol] or ὑ, sometimes _υ_ or υ [with\r\ndiaresis]) almost invariably. The shape of _xi_ is more complicated than\r\nusual (see our facsimile, No. 25); the other letters (e.g. _delta_ or\r\n_psi_) are such as were common in the sixth or early in the seventh\r\ncentury. There are also many changes by a later uncial hand. Mr. Hansell\r\n(Ancient Texts, Oxford, 1864), as well as Tischendorf, exhibits one whole\r\npage in zinco-photography.\r\n\r\nFa. COD. COISLIN. I.\r\n\r\nG. Tischendorf, in his eighth edition of the N. T., assigns this letter\r\n(formerly appropriated to Cod. L) to one octavo leaf of the seventh\r\ncentury, now at St. Petersburg, written in thick uncials without accents,\r\ntorn from the wooden cover of a Syriac book, and containing Acts ii.\r\n45-iii. 8. It has a few rare and valuable readings. Dr. Hort (Supplement\r\nto Tregelles, p. 1021) cites it as Ga.\r\n\r\nGb. VATICANUS ROMANUS 9671 [iv?] fol., ff. 5 (22), palimpsest. _See_\r\nGregory, Prolegomena, p. 414.\r\n\r\nH. COD. MUTINENSIS [cxcvi], ii. G. 3, of the Acts, in the Grand Ducal\r\nLibrary at Modena, is an uncial copy of about the ninth century, defective\r\nin Acts i. 1-v. 28; ix. 39-x. 19; xiii. 36-xiv. 3, all supplied by a\r\ncursive hand [h], “in my judgement ... scarcely later” (Burgon), and in\r\nxxvii. 4-xxviii. 31 (written in uncials of about the eleventh century).\r\nThe Epistles are in cursive letters of the twelfth century, indicated in\r\nthe Catholic Epistles by h, in the Pauline by 179. Scholz first collated\r\nit loosely, as usual; then Tischendorf in 1843, Tregelles in 1846,\r\nafterwards comparing their collations for mutual correction.\r\n\r\nI. COD. PETROPOLIT. or TISCHENDORFIAN. II.\r\n\r\nK. COD. MOSQUENSIS, S. Synodi No. 98, is Matthaei’s g, and came from the\r\nmonastery of St. Dionysius on Mount Athos. It contains the Catholic\r\nEpistles entire, but not the Acts; and the Pauline Epistles are defective\r\nonly in Rom. x. 18-1 Cor. vi. 13; 1 Cor. viii. 7-11. Matthaei alone has\r\ncollated this document, and judging from his facsimile (Cath. Epp. 1782)\r\nit seems to belong to the ninth century. This copy is Scholz’s Act. 102,\r\nPaul. 117. It is not so thoroughly known but that it is often necessary to\r\ncite its readings _ex silentio_.\r\n\r\nL (formerly G). COD. BIBLIOTH. ANGELICAE A. 2. 15, belonging to the\r\nAugustinian monks at Rome, formerly “Cardinalis Passionei,” contains the\r\nActs from ch. viii. 10, μισ του θεου to the end, the Catholic Epistles\r\ncomplete, and the Pauline down to Heb. xiii. 10, οὐκ ἔχουσιν, of a date\r\nnot earlier than the middle of the ninth century. It was collated in part\r\nby Bianchini and Birch, in full by Scholz (1820, J. Paul) and by F. F.\r\nFleck (1833). Tischendorf in 1843, Tregelles in 1845, collated it\r\nindependently, and subsequently compared their papers, as they have done\r\nin several other instances.\r\n\r\nM of Gregory (Gb), fol., ff. 5 (22), palimpsest, containing fragments of\r\nActs xvi-xviii of the eighth or ninth century, was published by Cozza\r\n(Sacr. Bibl. Vetust. Frag. iii: Rome, 1877). It was transferred to the\r\nVatican (No. 9671) from the Greek convent of Grotta Ferrata.\r\n\r\nP. COD. PORPHYRIANUS is a palimpsest containing the Acts, all the\r\nEpistles, the Apocalypse, and a few fragments of 4 Maccabees, of the ninth\r\ncentury, found by Tischendorf in 1862 at St. Petersburg in the possession\r\nof the Archimandrite (now Bishop) Porphyry, who allowed him to take it to\r\nLeipsic to decipher. He has published it at length in his “Monumenta sacra\r\ninedita,” vol. v, vi, whence Tregelles derived its readings for the\r\nPauline Epistles and the Apocalypse. In the latter book it is especially\r\nuseful, and generally confirms Codd. AC, though it is often with Cod. א,\r\nsometimes against all the rest. It has the αρ [with χ over them] and τε\r\n[with circumflex over them] of Church lessons in the margin, and is\r\ndefective (besides a few words or letters lost here and there) in Acts i.\r\n1-ii. 15; 1 John iii. 20-v. 1; Jude 4-15; Rom. ii. 16-iii. 5; viii. 33-ix.\r\n11; xi. 22-xii. 1; 1 Cor. vii. 16, 17; xii. 23-xiii. 5; xiv. 23-39; 2 Cor.\r\nii. 14, 15; Col. iii. 16-iv. 8; 1 Thess. iii. 5-iv. 17; Apoc. xvi.\r\n13-xvii. 1; xx. 1-9; xxii. 6-21. Moreover James ii. 12-21; 2 Pet. i.\r\n20-ii. 5 are barely legible. Mr. Hammond (Outlines of Textual Criticism)\r\nhas taken from Tischendorf’s fifth volume a neat facsimile of it in Acts\r\niv. 10-15, comprising uncials of the latest form, leaning to the right,\r\nlying under cursive writing (Heb. vii. 17-25), some four centuries more\r\nrecent. Dr. Hort (Supplement to Tregelles, p. xxx) states that in the Acts\r\nthe text of Cod. P is almost exclusively of a very late type, but that it\r\ncontains a much larger though varying proportion of various readings\r\nelsewhere, except in 1 Peter. The upper or later writing in this\r\nmanuscript is, for once, available for critical purposes, since it\r\nconsists of fragments of the labours of Euthalius (_see_ p. 64), and is\r\ncited by Tischendorf under the notation of Euthal.cod.\r\n\r\nS.

CLAROMONTANUS, No. 107 of the Royal Library at Paris, is a\r\nGreek-Latin copy of St. Paul’s Epistles, one of the most ancient and\r\nimportant in existence. Like the Cod. Ephraemi in the same Library it has\r\nbeen fortunate in such an editor as Tischendorf, who published it in 1852\r\nwith complete Prolegomena, and a facsimile traced by Tregelles. This noble\r\nvolume is in small quarto, written on 533 leaves of the thinnest and\r\nfinest vellum: indeed its extraordinary delicacy has caused the writing at\r\nthe back of every page to be rather too visible on the other side. The\r\nwords, both Greek and Latin, are written continuously (except the Latin\r\ntitles and subscriptions), but in a stichometrical form (_see_ p. 52): the\r\nGreek, as in Cod. Bezae, stands on the left or first page of the opened\r\nbook, not on the right, as in the Cod. Laudianus. Each page has but one\r\ncolumn of about twenty-one lines, so that in this copy, as in the Codex\r\nBezae, the Greek and Latin are in parallel lines, but on separate pages.\r\nThe ink is dark and clear, and otherwise the book is in good condition. It\r\ncontains all St. Paul’s Epistles (the Hebrews after Philemon), except Rom.\r\ni. 1-7; 27-30, both Greek and Latin: Rom. i. 24-27 in the Latin is\r\nsupplied in a later but very old hand, as also are Rom. i. 27-30 and 1\r\nCor. xiv. 13-22 in the Greek: the Latin of 1 Cor. xiv. 8-18; Heb. xiii.\r\n21-23 is lost. The Epistle to the Hebrews has been erroneously imputed by\r\nsome to a later scribe, inasmuch as it is not included in the list of the\r\nsacred books and in the number of their στίχοι or _versus_, which stand\r\nimmediately _before_ the Hebrews in this codex(208): but the same list\r\noverlooks the Epistle to the Philippians, which has never been doubted to\r\nbe St. Paul’s: in this manuscript, however, the Epistle to the Colossians\r\nprecedes that to the Philippians. Our earliest notice of it is derived\r\nfrom the Preface to Beza’s third edition of the N. T. (Feb. 20, 1582): he\r\nthere describes it as of equal antiquity with his copy of the Gospels (D),\r\nand states that it had been found “in Claromontano apud Bellovacos\r\ncoenobio,” at Clermont near Beauvais. Although Beza sometimes through\r\ninadvertence calls his codex of the Gospels Claromontanus, there seems no\r\nreason for disputing with Wetstein the correctness of his account (see p.\r\n125, note 2), though it throws no light on the manuscript’s early history.\r\nFrom Beza it passed into the possession of Claude Dupuy, Councillor of\r\nParis, probably on Beza’s death [1605]: thence to his sons Jacques and\r\nPierre Dupuy: before the death of Jacques (who was the King’s Librarian)\r\nin 1656, it had been bought by Louis XIV for the Royal Library at Paris.\r\nIn 1707, John Aymont, an apostate priest, stole thirty-five leaves; one,\r\nwhich he disposed of in Holland, was restored in 1720 by its possessor\r\nStosch; the rest were sold to that great collector, Harley, Earl of\r\nOxford, but sent back in 1729 by his son, who had learnt their shameful\r\nstory. Beza made some, but not a considerable, use of this document; it\r\nwas amongst the authorities consulted for Walton’s Polyglott; Wetstein\r\ncollated it twice in early life (1715-16); Tregelles examined it in 1849,\r\nand compared his results with the then unpublished transcript of\r\nTischendorf, which proved on its appearance (1852) the most difficult, as\r\nwell as one of the most important, of his critical works; so hard it had\r\nbeen found at times to determine satisfactorily the original readings of a\r\nmanuscript which had been corrected by _nine_ different hands, ancient and\r\nmodern. The date of the codex is doubtless the sixth century, in the\r\nmiddle or towards the end of it. The Latin letters, especially _d_, are\r\nthe latest in form (facsimile No. 41, 1 Cor. xiii. 5-8), and are much like\r\nthose in the Cod. Bezae (No. 42), which in many points Cod. Claromontanus\r\nstrongly resembles. Leaves 162, 163 are palimpsest, and contain part of\r\nthe Phaethon, a lost play of Euripides. We have already noticed many of\r\nits peculiarities (pp. 33-40), and need not here repeat them. _Delta_ and\r\n_pi_ look more ancient even than in Cod. A: the uncials are simple,\r\nsquare, regular and beautiful, of about the size of those in Codd. CD, and\r\nlarger than in Cod. B. The stichometry forbids our assigning it to a\r\nperiod earlier than the end of the fifth century while other circumstances\r\nconnected with the Latin version tend to put it a little lower still. The\r\napostrophus is frequent, but there are few stops or abridgements; no\r\nbreathings or accents are _primâ manu_. Initial letters, placed at the\r\nbeginning of books or sections, are plain, and not much larger than the\r\nrest. The comparative correctness of the Greek text, and its Alexandrian\r\nforms, have caused certain critics to refer us as usual to Egypt for its\r\ncountry: the Latin text is more faulty, and shows comparative ignorance of\r\nthe language: yet of what use a Latin version could be except in Africa or\r\nwestern Europe it were hard to imagine. This Latin is more independent of\r\nthe Greek, and less altered from it than in Codd. Bezae or Laudian.,\r\nwherein it has little critical value: that of Cod. Claromont. better\r\nrepresents the African type of the Old Latin. Of the corrections, a few\r\nwere made by the original scribe when revising; a hand of the seventh\r\ncentury went through the whole (D**); two others follow; then in sharp\r\nblack uncials of the ninth or tenth century another made more than two\r\nthousand critical changes in the text, and added stops and all the\r\nbreathings and accents (D***); another D**** (among other changes) added\r\nto the Latin subscriptions. Db supplied Rom. i. 27-30 very early; Dc, a\r\nlater hand, 1 Cor. xiv. 13-22. Tischendorf distinguishes several others\r\nbesides these.\r\n\r\nE. COD. SANGERMANENSIS is another Greek-Latin manuscript and takes its\r\nname from the Abbey of St. Germain des Prez near Paris. Towards the end of\r\nthe last century the Abbey (which at the Revolution had been turned into a\r\nsaltpetre manufactory) was burnt down, and many of its books were lost. In\r\n1805 Matthaei found this copy, as might almost have been anticipated, at\r\nSt. Petersburg, where it is now deposited. The volume is a large quarto,\r\nthe Latin and Greek in parallel columns on the same page, the Greek\r\nstanding on the left; its uncials are coarse, large, and thick, not unlike\r\nthose in Cod. E of the Acts, but of later shape, with breathings and\r\naccents _primâ manu_, of about the tenth, or late in the ninth,\r\ncentury(209). It was used for the Oxford New Testament of 1675: Mill\r\nobtained some extracts from it, and noted its obvious connexion with Cod.\r\nClaromontanus: Wetstein thoroughly collated it; and not only he but\r\nSabatier and Griesbach perceived that it was, at least in the Greek,\r\nnothing better than a mere transcript of Cod. Claromontanus, made by some\r\nignorant person later than the corrector indicated by D****. Muralt’s\r\nendeavours to shake this conclusion have not satisfied better judges;\r\nindeed the facts are too numerous and too plain to be resisted. Thus,\r\nwhile in Rom. iv. 25 Cod. D reads δικαιωσιν (accentuated δικαίωσιν by\r\nD***), in which D*** changes ν into νην, the writer of Cod. E adopts\r\nδικαίωσινην with its monstrous accent: in 1 Cor. xv. 5 Cod. D reads μετα\r\nταυτα τοις ενδεκα, D*** εἶτα τοῖς δώδεκα (again observe the accents), out\r\nof which Cod. E makes up μετα ταυεἶτα τοῖς δώενδεκα. In Gal. iv. 31 Cod. D\r\nhas διο, which is changed by D*** into ἆρα: Cod. E mixes up the two into\r\nδιἆραο. Compare Tischendorf’s notes on Eph. ii. 19; Heb. x. 17, 33, and\r\nDr. Hort’s longer specimen, Rom. xv. 31-3 (Introd. p. 254). The Latin\r\nversion also is borrowed from Cod. D, but is more mixed, and may be of\r\nsome critical use: the Greek is manifestly worthless, and should long\r\nsince have been removed from the list of authorities. This copy is\r\ndefective, Rom. viii. 21-33; ix. 15-25; 1 Tim. i. 1-vi. 15; Heb. xii.\r\n8-xiii. 25.\r\n\r\nFa COD. COISLIN. I.\r\n\r\nF. COD. AUGIENSIS in the Library of Trinity College, Cambridge (B. xvii.\r\n1), is another Greek-Latin manuscript on 136 leaves of good vellum 4to\r\n(the _signatures_ proving that seven more are lost, _see_ p. 28), 9 inches\r\nby 7-¼, with the two languages in parallel columns of twenty-eight lines\r\non each page, the Greek being always inside, the Latin next the edge of\r\nthe book. It is called from the monastery of Augia Dives or Major\r\n(Reichenau, or _rich meadow_), on a fertile island in the lower part of\r\nLake Constance, to which it long appertained, and where it may even have\r\nbeen written, a thousand years since. By notices at the beginning and end\r\nwe can trace it through the hands of G. M. Wepfer of Schaffhausen and of\r\nL. Ch. Mieg, who covered many of its pages with Latin notes wretchedly\r\nscrawled, but allowed Wetstein to examine it. In 1718 Bentley was induced\r\nby Wetstein to buy it at Heidelberg for 250 Dutch florins, and both he and\r\nWetstein collated the Greek portion, the latter carelessly, but Bentley\r\nsomewhat more fully in the margin of a Greek Testament (Oxon. 1675) still\r\npreserved in Trinity College (B. xvii. 8). Tischendorf in 1842, Tregelles\r\nin 1845, re-examined the book (which had been placed where it now is on\r\nthe death of Bentley’s nephew in 1787), and drew attention to the Latin\r\nversion: in 1859 Scrivener published an edition of the Codex in common\r\ntype, with Prolegomena and a photograph of one page (1 Tim. iii. 14-iv.\r\n5)(210).  The Epistles of St. Paul are defective in Rom. i. 1-iii. 19; and\r\nthe Greek only in 1 Cor. iii. 8-16; vi. 7-14; Col. ii. 1-8; Philem. 21-25;\r\nin which four places the Latin stands in its own column with no Greek over\r\nagainst it. In the Epistle to the Hebrews, the Greek being quite lost, the\r\nLatin occupies both columns: this Epistle alone has an Argument, almost\r\nverbatim the same as we read in the great Cod. Amiatinus of the Vulgate.\r\nAt the end of the Epistle, and on the same page (fol. 139, _verso_),\r\ncommences a kind of Postscript (having little connexion with the sacred\r\ntext), the larger portion of which is met with under the title of Dicta\r\nAbbatis Pinophi, in the works of Rabanus Maurus, Archbishop of Mayence,\r\nwho died in A.D. 856; from which circumstance the Cod. Augiensis has been\r\nreferred to the ninth century. Palaeographical arguments also would lead\r\nus to the same conclusion. The Latin version (a modification of the\r\nVulgate in its purest form, though somewhat tampered with in parts to make\r\nit suit the Greek text(211)) is written in the cursive minuscule character\r\ncommon in the age of Charlemagne. The Greek must have been taken from an\r\narchetype with the words continuously written; for not only are they\r\nmiserably ill divided by the unlearned German(212) scribe, but his design\r\n(not always acted upon) was to put a single middle point at the end of\r\neach word. The Latin is exquisitely written, the Greek uncials are neat,\r\nbut evidently the work of an unpractised hand, which soon changes from\r\nweariness. The shapes of _eta_, _theta_, _pi_, and other testing letters\r\nare such as we might have expected from the date; some others have an\r\nolder look.  Contrary to the more ancient custom, capitals, small but\r\nnumerous, occur in the _middle_ of the lines in both languages. Of the\r\nordinary breathings(213) and accents there are no traces.  Here and there\r\nwe meet with a straight line, inclined between the horizontal and the\r\nacute accent, placed over an initial vowel, usually when it should be\r\naspirated, but not always (e.g. ίδιον 1 Cor. vi. 18). Over ι and υ double\r\nor single points, or a comma, are frequently placed, especially if they\r\nbegin a syllable; and occasionally a large comma or kind of circumflex\r\nover ι, ει, and some other vowels and diphthongs. The arrangement of the\r\nGreek forbids punctuation there; in the Latin we find the single middle\r\npoint as a colon or after an abridgement, the semicolon (;) sometimes, the\r\nnote of interrogation (?) when needed. Besides the universal forms of\r\nabridgement (_see_ p. 49), [symbol] and [symbol] are frequent in the\r\nGreek, but no others: in the Latin the abbreviations are numerous, and\r\nsome of them unusual: Scrivener (Cod. Augiensis Proleg. pp. xxxi-ii) has\r\ndrawn up a list of them. This copy abounds as much as any with real\r\nvariations from the common text, and with numberless errors of the pen,\r\nitacisms of vowels, and permutations of consonants. It exhibits many\r\ncorrections, a few _primâ manu_, some unfortunately very recent, but by\r\nfar the greater number in a hand almost contemporary with the manuscript,\r\nwhich has also inserted over the Greek, in 106 places, Latin renderings\r\ndiffering from those in the parallel column, but which in eighty-six of\r\nthese 106 instances agree with the Latin of the sister manuscript.\r\n\r\nG. COD. BOERNERIANUS, so called from a former possessor, but now in the\r\nRoyal Library at Dresden. In the sixteenth century it belonged to Paul\r\nJunius of Leyden: it was bought dear at the book-sale of Peter Francius,\r\nProfessor at Amsterdam, in 1705, by C. F. Boerner, a Professor at Leipsic,\r\nwho lent it to Kuster to enrich his edition of Mill (1710), and\r\nsubsequently to Bentley. The latter so earnestly wished to purchase it as\r\na companion to Cod. F, that though he received it in 1719, it could not be\r\nrecovered from him for five years, during which he was constantly offering\r\nhigh sums for it(214): a copy, but not in Bentley’s hand, had been already\r\nmade (Trin. Coll. B. xvii. 2). Cod. G was published in full by Matthaei in\r\n1791, in common type, with two facsimile pages (1 Cor. ii. 9-iii. 3; 1\r\nTim. i. 1-10), and his edition is believed to be very accurate; Anger,\r\nTischendorf, Tregelles, Böttiger and others who have examined it have only\r\nexpressly indicated three errors(215). Rettig has abundantly proved that,\r\nas it is exactly of the same size, so it once formed part of the same\r\nvolume with Cod. Δ (_see_ p. 157 and note): they must date towards the end\r\nof the ninth century, and may very possibly have been written in the\r\nmonastery of St. Gall (where Δ still remains) by some of the Irish monks\r\nwho flocked to those parts. That Cod. G has been in such hands appears\r\nfrom some very curious Irish lines at the foot of one of Matthaei’s plates\r\n(fol. 23), which, after having long perplexed learned men, have at length\r\nbeen translated for Dr. Reeves, the eminent Celtic scholar(216). All that\r\nwe have said respecting the form of Cod. Δ applies to this portion of it:\r\nthe Latin version (a specimen of the Old Latin, but as in Codd. Bezae and\r\nLaudianus much changed to suit the Greek) is cursive and interlinear; the\r\nGreek uncials coarse and peculiar; the punctuation chiefly a stop at the\r\nend of the words, which have no breathings nor accents. Its affinity to\r\nthe Cod. Augiensis has no parallel in this branch of literature. Scrivener\r\nhas noted all the differences between them at the foot of each page in his\r\nedition of Cod. F: they amount to but 1,982 places, whereof 578 are mere\r\nblunders of the scribe, 967 changes of vowels or itacisms, 166\r\ninterchanges of consonants, seventy-one grammatical or orthographical\r\nforms; the remaining 200 are real various readings, thirty-two of them\r\nrelating to the article. While in Cod. F (whose first seven leaves are\r\nlost) the text commences at Rom. iii. 19, μω; λεγει, this portion is found\r\ncomplete in Cod. G, except Rom. i. 1-5; ii. 16-25. All the other lacunae\r\nof Cod. F occur also in Cod. G, which ends at Philem. 20 ἐν _χρω_: there\r\nis no Latin version to supply these gaps in Cod. G, but a blank space is\r\nalways left, sufficient to contain what is missing. At the end of Philemon\r\nG writes (ad) Προς (laudicenses) λαουδακησασ(217) (incipit) αρχεται\r\n(epistola) επιστολη, but neither that writing nor the Epistle to the\r\nHebrews follows. It seems tolerably plain that one of these manuscripts\r\nwas not copied immediately from the other, for while they often accord\r\neven in the strangest errors of the pen that men unskilled in Greek could\r\nfall into, their division of the Greek words, though equally false and\r\nabsurd, is often quite different: it results therefore that they are\r\nindependent transcripts of the same venerable archetype (probably\r\nstichometrical and some centuries older than themselves) which was written\r\nwithout any division between the words(218). From the form of the letters\r\nand other circumstances Cod. F may be deemed somewhat but not much the\r\nolder; its corrector _secundâ manu_ evidently had both the Greek and the\r\nLatin of Cod. G before him, and Rabanus, in whose works the Dicta Pinophi\r\nare preserved (p. 178), was the great antagonist of Godeschalk, on whom\r\nthe annotator of Codd. ΔG bears so hard. Cod. G is in 4to, of ninety-nine\r\nleaves, with twenty-one lines in each. The line indicating breathing (if\r\nsuch be its use, _see_ p. 178) and the mark > employed to fill up spaces\r\n(p. 51), more frequent in it than in F.\r\n\r\n                  ‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐\r\n\r\nSince Dr. Scrivener wrote the above, a very valuable little treatise—a\r\n“specimen primum”—has been given to the learned world by Herr P.\r\nCorssen(219), and a most clear and carefully argued paper has been sent to\r\nthe editor by the Rev. Nicholas Pocock of Clifton. Both Herr Corssen and\r\nMr. Pocock agree in showing that F was not derived from G, nor G from F,\r\nbut that they come from the same original. Both agree, again, that the\r\nGreek version is derived, at least in large measure, from the Latin, as in\r\nsuch instances as the following, which are supplied by Mr. Pocock, who\r\nholds, and appears to prove, that F and G were copied from an interlinear\r\nmanuscript: _ut sciatis_, ινα οιδαται (F, G), 1 Thess. iii. 3; _sicut\r\ncancer ut serpat_, ως γαγγρα, ινα νομηνεξει (G), 2 Tim. ii. 17, F having\r\nthe same reading, only dividing the last word; Gal. iv. 3 _eramus autem\r\nservientes_, ημεθα δε δουλωμενοι (F, G). Herr Corssen considers that a\r\nLatin was the scribe of the original, that it was written in Italy, and\r\nthat it was better than the Claromontanus (D), to which it had affinities,\r\nthis last having an amended text with corrections from the Greek. The\r\noriginal of all three he supposes to date from not before the fifth\r\ncentury. But in some of these last suppositions we are getting upon the\r\nocean of conjecture.\r\n\r\nH. COD. COISLIN. 202 is a very precious fragment, of which twelve leaves\r\nare in the Imperial Library at Paris; nine are in the monastery or laura\r\nof St. Athanasius at Mount Athos, and have been edited by M. Duchesne in\r\nthe “Archives des missions scientifiques et littéraires” (1876); two more\r\nare at Moscow, and have been described by Matthaei (D. Pauli Epp. ad Hebr.\r\net Col. Riga, 1784, p. 58); some others are in the Antonian Library of St.\r\nPetersburg (three); some more in the Imperial Library as described by\r\nMuralt (two), or in that of Bishop Porphyry (one), or at Turin (two). The\r\nleaves at Paris contain 1 Cor. x. 22-29; xi. 9-16; 1 Tim. iii. 7-13; Tit.\r\ni. 1-3; 15-ii. 5; iii. 13-15; Heb. ii. 11-16; iii. 13-18; iv. 12-15. At\r\nMount Athos are 2 Cor. x. 18-xi. 6; xi. 12-xii. 2; Gal. i. 1-4; ii. 4-17;\r\niv. 30-v. 5. At Moscow, Heb. x. 1-7; 32-38. At St. Petersburg, 2 Cor. iv.\r\n2-7; 1 Thess. ii. 9-13; iv. 5-11 (Antonian); Gal. i. 4-10; ii. 9-14\r\n(Imperial).  In the Library of Bishop Porphyry, Col. iii. 4-11; and at\r\nTurin, 1 Tim. vi. 9-13; 2 Tim. ii. 1-9. They are in quarto, with large\r\nsquare uncials of about sixteen lines on a page, and date from the sixth\r\ncentury. Breathings and accents are added by a later hand, which retouched\r\nthis copy (_see_ Silvestre, Paléographie Universelle, Nos. 63, 64). These\r\nleaves, which comprise one of our best authorities for stichometrical\r\nwriting, were used in A.D. 1218 to bind some other manuscripts on Mount\r\nAthos, and thence came into the library of Coislin, Bishop of Metz.\r\nMontfaucon has published Cod. H in his “Bibliotheca Coisliniana,” but\r\nTischendorf, who transcribed it, projected a fuller and more accurate\r\nedition. He observed at Paris in 1865 an additional passage, 2 Cor. iv.\r\n4-6 (Monum. sacr. ined. vol. ix. p. xiv, note), and cites Cod. H in his\r\neighth edition on 1 Tim. vi. 19; Heb. x. 1-6; 34-38. The subscriptions,\r\nwhich appear due to Euthalius of Sulci(220), written in vermilion, are not\r\nretouched, and consequently have neither breathings nor accents. Besides\r\narguments to the Epistles, we copy the following final subscription from\r\nTischendorf (N. T. 1859, p. clxxxix): ἔγραψα καὶ ἐξεθέμην κατὰ δύναμιν\r\nστειχηρὸν; τόδε τὸ τεύχος παύλου τοῦ ἀποστόλου πρὸς ἐγγραμμὸν καὶ\r\nεὐκατάλημπτον ἀνάγνωσιν. τῶν καθ᾽ ἡμας ἀδελφῶν; παρῶν ἀπάντων τολμης\r\nσυγγνωμην ἀιτῶ. εὐχὴ τῆ ὑπὲρ ἐμῶν; τὴν συνπεριφορὰν κομιζόμενος; ἀντεβλῆθη\r\nδὲ ἡ βιβλος; πρὸς τὸ ἐν καισαρία ἀντίγραφον τῆς βιβλιοθήκης τοῦ ἁγίου\r\nπαμφίλου χειρὶ γεγραμένον αὐτοῦ (_see_ p. 55, note 1). From this\r\nsubscription we may conclude with Dr. Field (Proleg. in Hexapla Origenis,\r\np. xcix) that the noble Library at Caesarea was still safe in the sixth\r\ncentury, though it may have perished A.D. 638, when that city was taken by\r\nthe Saracens.\r\n\r\nI. COD. TISCHENDORFIAN. II, at St. Petersburg. Add also two large leaves\r\nof the sixth century, elegantly written, without breathings or accents,\r\ncontaining 2 Cor. i. 20-ii. 12. Described by Tischendorf, Notitia Cod.\r\nSin. Append, p. 50, cited as O in his eighth edition of the N. T.\r\n\r\nK. COD. MOSQUENSIS.\r\n\r\nL. COD. ANGELICUS at Rome.\r\n\r\nM. CODEX RUBER is peculiar for the beautifully bright red colour of the\r\nink(221), the elegance of the small uncial characters, and the excellency\r\nand critical value of the text. Two folio leaves, containing Heb. i. 1-iv.\r\n3; xii. 20-xiii. 25, once belonged to Uffenbach, then to J. C. Wolff, who\r\nbequeathed them to the Public Library (Johanneum) of Hamburg (_see_ Cod. H\r\nof the Gospels). To the same manuscript pertain fragments of two leaves\r\nused in binding Cod. Harleian. 5613 in the British Museum, and seen at\r\nonce by Griesbach, who first collated them (Symbol. Crit. vol. ii. p. 164,\r\n&c.), to be portions of the Hamburg fragment(222). Each page in both\r\ncontains two columns, of forty-five lines in the Hamburg, of thirty-eight\r\nin the London leaves. The latter comprise 1 Cor. xv. 52-2 Cor. i. 15; x.\r\n13-xii. 5; reckoning both fragments, 196 verses in all. Tischendorf has\r\nsince found one leaf more. Henke in 1800 edited the Hamburg portion,\r\nTregelles collated it twice, and Tischendorf in 1855 published the text of\r\nboth in full in his “Anecdota Sacra et Profana,” but corrected in the\r\nsecond edition, 1861 (Praef. xvi), five mistakes in his printed text. The\r\nletters are a little unusual in form, perhaps about the tenth century in\r\ndate; but though sometimes joined in the same word, can hardly be called\r\n_semicursive_. Our facsimile (Plate xii, No. 34) is from the London\r\nfragment: the graceful, though peculiar, shapes both of _alpha_ and _mu_\r\n(_see_ p. 37, ter) closely resemble those in some writing of about the\r\nsame age, added to the venerable Leyden Octateuch, on a page published in\r\nfacsimile by Tischendorf (Monum. sacr. ined. vol. iii). Accents and\r\nbreathings are given pretty correctly and constantly: _iota_ ascript\r\noccurs three times (2 Cor. i. 1; 4; Heb. xiii. 21)(223); only ten\r\n_itacisms_ occur, and ν ἐφελκυστικόν (as it is called) is rare. The usual\r\nstop is the single point in its three positions, with a change in power,\r\nas in Cod. E of the Gospels. The interrogative (;) occurs once (Heb. iii.\r\n17), and > is often repeated to fill up space, or, in a smaller size, to\r\nmark quotations. After the name of each of the Epistles (2 Cor. and Heb.)\r\nin their titles we read εκτεθεισα ὡς εν πινακι, which Tischendorf thus\r\nexplains; that whereas it was customary to prefix an argument to each\r\nEpistle, these words, originally employed to introduce the argument, were\r\nretained even when the argument was omitted. Henke’s account of the\r\nexpression looks a little less forced, that this manuscript was set forth\r\nὡς εν πινακι, that is, in vermilion, after the pattern of Imperial letters\r\npatent.\r\n\r\nN. (Od Hort.) Two leaves of the ninth century at St. Petersburg,\r\ncontaining Gal. v. 14-vi. 2; Heb. v. 8-vi. 10.\r\n\r\nO. (Nc Tisch.) FRAGMENTA MOSQUENSIA used as early as A.D. 975 in binding a\r\nvolume of Gregory Nazianzen now at Moscow (S. Synodi 61). Matthaei\r\ndescribes them on Heb. x. 1: they contain only the twelve verses Heb. x.\r\n1-3; 3-7; 32-34; 35-38. These very ancient leaves may possibly be as old\r\nas the sixth century, for their letters resemble in shape those in Cod. H\r\nwhich the later hand has so coarsely renewed; but they are more probably a\r\nlittle later.\r\n\r\nOa. One unpublished double leaf brought by Tischendorf to St. Petersburg\r\nfrom the East, of the sixth century, containing 2 Cor. i. 20-ii. 12.\r\n\r\nOb of the same date, at Moscow, contains Eph. iv. 1-18.\r\n\r\nP. COD. PORPHYRIANUS.\r\n\r\nQ. Tischendorf also discovered in 1862 at St. Petersburg five or six\r\nleaves of St. Paul, written on papyrus of the fifth century. From the\r\nextreme brittleness of the leaves only portions can be read. He cites them\r\nat 1 Cor. vi. 13, 14; vii. 3, 13, 14. These also Porphyry brought from the\r\nEast. It contains 1 Cor. i. 17-20; vi. 13-15; 16-18; vii. 3, 4, 10, 11,\r\n12-14, with defects. This is the only papyrus manuscript of the New\r\nTestament written with uncials.\r\n\r\nR. Cod. Cryptoferratensis Z. β. 1. is a palimpsest fragment of the end of\r\nthe seventh or the eighth century, cited by Caspar René Gregory as first\r\nused by Tischendorf. It is one leaf, containing 2 Cor. xi. 9-19. Edited by\r\nCozza, and published amongst other old fragments at Rome in 1867 with\r\nfacsimile (Greg., p. 435).\r\n\r\nS. From Laura of Athos.\r\n\r\nT. Paris, Louvre, Egyptian Museum, 7332 [iv-vi], 5-¾ x 4, two small\r\nfragments, 1 Tim. vi. 3; iii. 15, 16. _See_ Gregory, p. 441, who, however,\r\nunconsciously classes it as an Evan.\r\n\r\nב. Rom. Vat. Gr. 2061.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII. Manuscripts of the Apocalypse.\r\n\r\n\r\nא. COD. SINAITICUS.\r\n\r\nA. COD. ALEXANDRINUS.\r\n\r\nB. COD. VATICANUS 2066 (formerly 105 in the Library of the Basilian monks\r\nin the city) was judiciously substituted by Wetstein for the modern\r\nportion of the great Vatican MS., collated by Mico, and published in 1796\r\nby Ford in his “Appendix” to Codex Alexandrinus, as also in 1868 by\r\nVercellone and Cozza(224). It is an uncial copy of about the end of the\r\neighth century, and the volume also contains in the same hand Homilies of\r\nBasil the Great and of Gregory of Nyssa, &c. It was first known from a\r\nnotice (by Vitali) and facsimile in Bianchini’s Evangeliarium Quadruplex\r\n(1749), part i. vol. ii. p. 524 (facs. p. 505, tab. iv): Wetstein was\r\npromised a collation of it by Cardinal Quirini, who seems to have met with\r\nunexpected hindrances, as the papers only arrived after the text of the\r\nNew Testament was printed, and then proved very loose and defective. When\r\nTischendorf was at Rome in 1843, though forbidden to collate it afresh (in\r\nconsequence, as we now know, of its having been already printed in Mai’s\r\nthen unpublished volumes of the Codex Vaticanus), he was permitted to make\r\na facsimile of a few verses, and while thus employed he so far contrived\r\nto elude the watchful custodian, as to compare the whole manuscript with a\r\nmodern Greek Testament. The result was given in his Monumenta sacra\r\ninedita (1846), pp. 407-432, with a good facsimile; but (as was natural\r\nunder the unpromising circumstances—“_arrepta potius quam lecta_” is his\r\nown confession) Tregelles in 1845 was able to observe several points which\r\nhe had overlooked, and more have come to light since Mai’s edition has\r\nappeared. In 1866, however, Tischendorf was allowed to transcribe this\r\ndocument at leisure, and re-published it in full in his Appendix N. T.\r\nVaticani, 1869, pp. 1-20.\r\n\r\nThis Codex is now known to contain the whole of the Apocalypse, a fact\r\nwhich the poor collation that Wetstein managed to procure had rendered\r\ndoubtful. It is rather an octavo than a folio or quarto; the uncials being\r\nof a peculiar kind, simple and unornamented, leaning a little to the right\r\n(_see_ p. 41, note): they hold a sort of middle place between square and\r\noblong characters. The shape of _beta_ is peculiar, the two loops to the\r\nright nowhere touching each other, and _psi_ has degenerated into the form\r\nof a cross (_see_ Plate iii, No. 7): _delta_, _theta_, _xi_ are also of\r\nthe latest uncial fashion. The breathings and accents are _primâ manu_,\r\nand pretty correct; the rule of the grammarians respecting the change of\r\npower of the single point in punctuation according to its change of\r\nposition is now regularly observed. The scarcity of old copies of the\r\nApocalypse renders this uncial of some importance, and it often confirms\r\nthe readings of the older codices אAC, though on the whole it resembles\r\nthem considerably less than does Cod. P, and agrees in preference with the\r\nlater or more ordinary cursives.\r\n\r\nC. CODEX EPHRAEMI.\r\n\r\nP. CODEX PORPHYRIANUS.\r\n\r\n\r\n    _Note._ Of the three large uncials which contain the Apocalypse,\r\n    אA are complete, but C has lost 171 verses out of 405. In the 286\r\n    places wherein the three are available, and Lachmann, Tregelles,\r\n    and Tischendorf, one or all, depart from the Received text, אAC\r\n    agree fifty-two times, אA seventeen, אC twenty-six, AC eighty-two,\r\n    and this last combination supplies the best readings: א stands\r\n    alone twenty-three times, A fifty-nine, C twenty-seven. When C has\r\n    failed us אA agree fifty-two times and differ eighty-eight.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII. CURSIVE MANUSCRIPTS OF THE GOSPELS. PART I.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe later manuscripts of the Greek Testament, written in cursive\r\ncharacters from the tenth down to the fifteenth century or later, are too\r\nnumerous to be minutely described in an elementary work like the present.\r\nWe shall therefore speak of them with all possible brevity, dwelling only\r\non a few which present points of especial interest, and employing certain\r\nabbreviations, a list of which we subjoin for the reader’s\r\nconvenience(225).\r\n\r\n\r\n    _Abbreviations used in the following Catalogue._\r\n\r\n    _Act._ MS. of Acts and Catholic Epistles.\r\n\r\n    _Am._ Ammonian Sections (so-called) in the margin of MSS.\r\n\r\n    _Apoc._ MS. of the Apocalypse.\r\n\r\n    _Apost._ MS. of Apostolos.\r\n\r\n    Ἀναγν. Ἀναγνώσματα or ἀναγνώσεις, readings or lections: here marks\r\n    of the lections in the margin or at the head or foot of pages, or\r\n    the computation of them at the end of the book.\r\n\r\n    _Argent._ Written in silver letters, either capitals or all.\r\n\r\n    Ἀρχή and τέλος, see _Lect._\r\n\r\n    _Aur._ Written in gold letters, either capitals (_l._ _l._) or\r\n    all.\r\n\r\n    _Carp._ Epistle to Carpianus.\r\n\r\n    _Chart._ Written on paper.\r\n\r\n    _Chart._ by itself = linen paper.\r\n\r\n    _Chart. b._ = _bombycina_, or cotton paper.\r\n\r\n    _Cols._ Columns. When the MS. is written only in one, no notice is\r\n    given.\r\n\r\n    _Coll._ Collated.\r\n\r\n    _Curs._ Cursive MSS.\r\n\r\n    _Eus._ Eusebian Canons standing in the margin under Ammonian\r\n    Sections.\r\n\r\n    _Eus. t._ Tables of so-called Eusebian Canons prefixed to the\r\n    Gospels.\r\n\r\n    _Euthal._ κεφ. Euthalian κεφάλαια found in Acts and Epistles.\r\n\r\n    _Evan._ Evangelia.\r\n\r\n    _Evst._ Evangelistaria.\r\n\r\n    Ff. _Folia_, or leaves.  The figures in brackets immediately\r\n    appended denote the number of lines on a page.\r\n\r\n    _Harm._ Harmony, sometimes given with κεφ. t.\r\n\r\n    _Insp._ Inspected.\r\n\r\n    Κεφ. Letters in the margin denoting the κεφάλαια _majora_.\r\n\r\n    Κεφ. _t._ Tables of κεφ. prefixed to each book.\r\n\r\n    _Lect._ Notices of proper lessons for feasts, &c., in the margin,\r\n    or above, or below, or interspersed with the text. Often marked\r\n    with ἀρχή and τέλος at beginning and end.\r\n\r\n    _Membr._ On vellum.\r\n\r\n    _Men._ A menology, or calendar, of Saints’ Days at the beginning\r\n    or end of a book.\r\n\r\n    _Mus._ Musical notes, especially in Evangelistaria.\r\n\r\n    _Mut._ That the copy is mutilated.\r\n\r\n    _Orn._ Ornamented.\r\n\r\n    _Paul._ MS. of St. Paul’s Epistles.\r\n\r\n    _Pict._ Illuminated with pictures.\r\n\r\n    _Prol._ Contains a prologue or ὑπόθεσις.\r\n\r\n    Ῥήμ. Where the ῥήματα, or phrases are numbered.\r\n\r\n    _Syn._ A synaxarion, or calendar, of daily lessons—also called\r\n    _eclogadion_.\r\n\r\n    Στίχ. Where the στίχοι, or lines, are numbered.\r\n\r\n    _Subscr._ Subscriptions (ὑπογραφαί) at the end of books.\r\n\r\n    Τίτλ. Titles of κεφ. at the head or foot of the pages.\r\n\r\n    _Vers._ Greek or Latin metrical verses at beginning or end of\r\n    books.\r\n\r\n    _Unc._ Uncial MS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe other Abbreviations will be evident upon perusing this work. Where\r\n_Chart._ is not printed, the MS. is written on vellum. The Latin numeral\r\nwithin square brackets denotes the date of the book, whether fixed by a\r\nsubscription in the book itself, or approximated by other means, e.g.\r\n[xiii] indicates a book of the thirteenth century. The Arabic numerals\r\nwithin ordinary brackets denote the number of lines on a page. Thus 297\r\n(38) = 297 leaves and thirty-eight lines in a page. The names within\r\nparentheses indicate the _collators_ or _inspectors_ of each manuscript,\r\nand if it has been satisfactorily examined, an asterisk is prefixed to the\r\nnumber by which it is known. If the copy contain other portions of the New\r\nTestament, its notation in those portions is always given. Measurements\r\nwhere given are in inches(226).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n(1) Manuscripts of the Gospels.\r\n\r\n\r\n*1. (Act. 1, Paul. 1.) Basiliensis A. N. iv. 2 at Basle [x, Burgon xii or\r\nxiii], 7-3/8 × 4-½, ff. 297 (38); _prol._, _pict._, τίτλ., _syn._, ἀναγν.\r\nin Acts and Epp. by later hand. Hebrews last in Paul. Gospels bound up\r\nlast of all. Among the illuminations were what have been said to be\r\npictures of the Emperor Leo the Wise [886-911] and his son Constantine\r\nPorphyrogenitus, but all the beautiful miniatures were stolen prior to\r\n1860-2, except one before St. John’s Gospel. Its later history is the same\r\nas that of Cod. E of the Gospels: it was known to Erasmus; it was borrowed\r\nby Reuchlin, a few extracts given by Bengel (Bas. γ), collated by\r\nWetstein, and recently in the Gospels by C. L. Roth and Tregelles, who\r\nhave compared their results. Our facsimile (No. 23) gives an excellent\r\nnotion of the elegant and minute style of writing, which is fully\r\nfurnished with breathings, accents, and ι ascript. The initial letters are\r\ngilt, and on the first page of each Gospel the full point is a large gilt\r\nball. In the Gospels the text adheres frequently to the uncials Codd. אB,\r\nBL and such cursives as 118, 131, and especially 209 (Insp. by Burgon,\r\nHoskier, Greg.).\r\n\r\n2. Basil. A. N. iv. 1 [xv or earlier], 7-¾ × 6, ff. 248 (20), _subscr._,\r\nκεφ. _t._, κεφ. (not John), τίτλ., _Am._, is the inferior manuscript\r\nchiefly used by Erasmus for his first edition of the N. T. (1516), with\r\npress corrections by his hand, and barbarously scored with red chalk to\r\nsuit his pages. The monks at Basle had bought it for two Rhenish florins\r\n(Bengel, Wetstein, Burgon, Hoskier, Greg.).\r\n\r\n3. (Act. 3, Paul. 3.) Cod. Corsendonck.

It was lent to\r\nErasmus for his second edition in 1519, as he testifies on the first leaf\r\n(Alter). It had been collated before Alter by J. Walker for Bentley, when\r\nin “the Dominican Library, Brussels.” This collation is unpublished (Trin.\r\nColl. B. xvii. 34): Ellis, Bentleii Critica Sacra, p. xxix (Greg.).\r\n\r\n4. Cod. Regius 84 [xii], 7-¼ × 5-¾, ff. 212 (27), κεφ. _t._, κεφ., τίτλ.,\r\n_Am._, _Eus._, _lect._, _syn._, _men._, _subscr._, στίχ., in the Royal\r\nLibrary at Paris (designated RI by Tischendorf), was rightly recognized by\r\nLe Long as Robert Stephen’s γ´ (see Chap. V). Mill notices its affinity to\r\nthe Latin versions and the Complutensian edition (N. T. Prol. § 1161);\r\n_mut._ in Matt. ii. 9-20; John i. 49-iii. 11; forty-nine verses. It is\r\nclumsily written and contains _syn._ from some Fathers (Scholz, Greg.).\r\n\r\n5. (Act. 5, Paul. 5.) Paris, National (Library), Greek 106 [xii or later],\r\nis Stephen’s δ´: 8-¼ × 6-1/8, ff. 348 (28), _prob._, κεφ. _t._, κεφ.,\r\nτίτλ., _Am._, _Eus._ Carefully written and full of flourishes (Wetstein,\r\nScholz, Greg.).\r\n\r\n6. (Act. 6, Paul. 6.) Par. Nat.

This exquisite manuscript\r\nis written in characters so small, that some pages require a glass to read\r\nthem. Scholz collated Matt., Mark i-iv, John vii, viii (Greg.).\r\n\r\n7. Par. Nat. Gr. 71 [xi], is Stephen’s ϛ´. 8 × 6-¼, ff. 186 (29), _prol._,\r\n_syn._, _Carp._, _Eus. t._, _pict._, τίτλ. with metrical paraphrase,\r\n_Am._, _Eus._, _men._, very full _lect._ In style not unlike Cod. 4, but\r\nneater (Wetst., Scholz, Abbé Martin, Greg.).\r\n\r\n8. Par. Nat. Gr. 49 [xi], 11-¼ × 8-½, ff. 199 (22), two columns, proved by\r\nMr. Vansittart to be Stephen’s ζ´(227): beautifully written in two columns\r\non the page. _Carp._, _Eus. t._, _prol._, _pict._, κεφ., τίτλ., _lect._,\r\n_men._, _Am._, _Eus._, _syn._ (Wetst., Scholz, Greg.).\r\n\r\n9. Par. Nat. Gr. 83 [A.D. 1167, when “Manuel Porphyrogenitus was ruler of\r\nConstantinople, Amauri of Jerusalem, William II of Sicily”: this note\r\n(derived from Wetstein) is now nearly obliterate], 9-¼ × 6-¾, ff. 298\r\n(20), is probably Stephen’s ιβ´. _Carp._, _Eus. t._, _pict._, κεφ., τίτλ.,\r\n_Am._, _syn._, _mut._, _men._, _subscr._, στίχ. (first leaf of St. John).\r\nIt once belonged to Peter Stella. The style is rather barbarous, and\r\nornamentation peculiar (Kuster’s Paris 3, Scholz, Greg.).\r\n\r\n10. Par. Nat. Gr. 91 [xiii or later], 7-½ × 5-7/8, ff. 275 (24), given in\r\n1439 to a library of Canons Regular at Verona by Dorotheus Archbishop of\r\nMitylene, when he came to the Council of Florence. Scholz tells us that it\r\nwas “antea Joannis Huraultii Boistallerii.” Griesbach mistook this copy\r\nfor Reg. 95, olim  2865/3, which is Kuster’s Paris 1 and Wetstein’s Cod.\r\n10, being Cod. 285 of Scholz and our own list (Burgon, _Guardian_, Jan.\r\n15, 1873). _Carp._, _Eus. t._, _pict._, κεφ., τίτλ., _Am._, _Eus._,\r\n_lect._, _syn._, _men._ (Griesbach, Scholz, Greg.).\r\n\r\n11. Par. Nat. Gr. 121-2 [xii or earlier], in two small volumes, 6-3/8 ×\r\n3-5/8, neatly written, ff. 230 and 274 (16), _Eus. t.,_ κεφ., τίτλ.,\r\n_Am._, _Eus._ It also once belonged to Teller (Kuster’s Paris 4, Scholz,\r\nGreg.).\r\n\r\n12. Par. Nat. Gr. 230 [xi], 10-3/8 × 8-1/8, 294 (21), _prol._, _pict._,\r\n_Eus. t._, κεφ. _t._, κεφ., τίτλ., with a commentary, that on St. Mark\r\nbeing Victor’s of Antioch (Greg.).\r\n\r\n13. Par.

This, like Codd. 10, 11, once\r\nbelonged to Teller: it is not correctly written. _Syn._, _mut._ in Matt.\r\ni. 1-ii. 20; xxvi. 33-53; xxvii. 26-xxviii. 10; Mark i. 20-45; John xxi.\r\n3-25; 163 verses (Kuster, Wetstein, Griesbach, Begtrup in 1797). This\r\nmanuscript was collated in 1868 by Professor W. H. Ferrar, Fellow of\r\nTrinity College, Dublin [d. 1871], who regarded Codd. 13, 69, 124, 346 as\r\ntranscripts of one archetype, which he proposed to restore by comparing\r\nthe four copies together. His design was carried out by Professor T. K.\r\nAbbott, Fellow and Tutor of Trinity College. For facsimiles of them all,\r\n&c., _see_ “Collation of Four Important Manuscripts of the Gospels,” &c.\r\nDublin, 1877 (Greg.).\r\n\r\n14. Par. Nat. Gr. 70 [xii or xiii, Greg. x], 6-7/8 × 4-5/8, ff. 392 (17),\r\nonce Cardinal Mazarin’s; was Kuster’s Paris 7. A facsimile of this\r\nbeautiful copy, with round conjoined minuscule letters, regular breathings\r\nand accents, is given in the “Paléographie Universelle,” No. 78, and in\r\nMontfaucon, Pal. Gr., p. 282. _Mut._ Matt. i. 1-9; iii. 16-iv. 9. Κεφ.\r\n_t._, _pict._, Paschal Canon, _Carp._, _Eus. t._, κεφ. t., κεφ., τίτλ.,\r\n_Am._, _Eus._ (Kuster, Scholz).\r\n\r\n15. Par. Nat.

Par. Nat. Gr. 54, formerly 1881 [xiv], 12-3/8 × 10, ff.?, 2 cols.,\r\n_Eus. t._ (Latin), _pict._, κεφ., τίτλ., _Am._ (Matt. and Mark), _lect._,\r\n_subscr._; once belonged to the Medici; it has a Latin version in parts;\r\n_mut._ Mark xvi. 6-20. _Eus. t._, _syn._, _pict._ (Wetstein, Scholz). This\r\ngorgeous and “right royal” copy was never quite finished, but is unique in\r\nrespect of being written in four colours, vermilion, lake, blue, and\r\nblack, according to the character of the contents (Burgon, Greg.).\r\n\r\n17. Par. Nat. Gr. 55 [xvi], 11-¾ × 8-¼, ff. 353 (25), 2 cols., has the\r\nLatin Vulgate version: it was neatly written, not by George Hermonymus the\r\nSpartan (but see Greg.), as Wetstein guesses, but by a Western\r\nprofessional scribe, Burgon. It once belonged to Cardinal Bourbon. _Syn._,\r\n_pict._ very elegant, _lect._ (Wetstein, Griesbach, Scholz).\r\n\r\n18. (Act. 113, Paul. 132, Apoc. 51.) Par. Nat. Gr. 47, formerly 2241 [A.D.\r\n1364], 11-½ × 8-3/8, ff. 444 (23), _prol._, κεφ. _t._, κεφ., _lect._,\r\nἀναγν., _subscr._, στίχ., _syn._, _men._; bought in 1687, and written at\r\nConstantinople. It is one of the few copies of the whole New Testament\r\n(_see_ p. 72, note), and was given by Nicephorus Cannabetes to the\r\nmonastery τοῦ ζωοδότου χριστοῦ ἐν τῷ τοῦ Μυζιθρᾶ (Misitra) τῆς\r\nΛακεδαίμονος κάστρῳ.  Two _syn._ between the Pauline Epistles and the\r\nApocalypse, psalms, hymns (Scholz, Greg., Reiche).\r\n\r\n19. Par. Nat. Gr. 189, formerly 1880 [xii], 12-½ × 9-¼, ff. 387, κεφ.\r\n_t._, κεφ., τίτλ., _Am._, _Eus._, _subscr._, Wetstein’s 1869, once\r\nbelonged to the Medici, _pict._, with Victor’s commentary on St. Mark, a\r\ncatena to St. John, and scholia to the other Gospels. In marvellous\r\ncondition, with much gold ornamentation (Scholz, Greg.).\r\n\r\n20. Par. Nat. Gr. 188, formerly 1883 [xii], 13-1/8 × 9-1/8, a splendid\r\nfolio, ff. 274, κεφ. _t._, κεφ., τίτλ., _Am._, _Eus._, _lect._, _subscr._,\r\nστίχ.—all by second hand (Greg.), brought from the East in 1669. It is\r\nbeautifully written, and contains catenae, Victor’s commentary on St.\r\nMark, and other treatises enumerated by Scholz, who collated most of it.\r\nAt the end of SS. Mark, Luke, and John “dicitur etiam hoc evangelium ex\r\naccuratis codicibus esse exscriptum, nec non collatum” (Scholz). A second\r\n(or perhaps the original) hand has been busy here to assimilate the text\r\nto that of Codd. 215, 300, or to some common model. In Cod. 215 the\r\nforegoing subscription is appended to all the Four Gospels, and the other\r\ncontents correspond exactly (Burgon, Last Twelve Verses of St. Mark, pp.\r\n119, 279). See on Evann. Λ, 428. Collated by W. F. Rose.\r\n\r\n21. Par. Nat. Gr. 68, formerly 2860 [x], 9 × 7-1/8, ff. 203, 2 cols.,\r\n_pict._, κεφ., τίτλ., _Am._, _men._, with _syn._ on paper in a later hand\r\n(Scholz, Greg.).\r\n\r\n22. Par. Nat. Gr. 72, once Colbert. 2467 [xi], 10-¼ × 7-½, ff. 232 (22),\r\ncontains remarkable readings. John xiv. 22-xvi. 27. Fully collated by the\r\nRev. W. F. Rose (_see_ Evan. 563). It begins Matt. ii. 2, six leaves\r\ncontaining Matt. v. 25-viii. 4 being misplaced before it. Κεφ. _t._,\r\nτίτλ., κεφ., _Am._, _Eus._ partial, _subscr._ No _lect._, ἀρχ., or _mut._\r\nMatt. iv. 20-v. 25; τέλ. p. m. A beautiful copy, singularly free from\r\nitacisms and errors from homœoteleuton, and very carefully accentuated,\r\nwith slight illuminated headings to the Gospels, which I recently had the\r\npleasure of inspecting (Wetstein, Scholz, Scriv., Greg.).\r\n\r\n23. Par. Nat. Gr. 77, Colbert. 3947 [xi], 9 × 7-¼, 4to, ff. 230, κεφ.\r\n_t._, κεφ., τίτλ., _Am._, _lect._, with the Latin Vulgate version down to\r\nLuke iv. 18. _Mut._ Matt. i. 1-17; Luke xxiv. 46-John ii. 20; xxi. 24, 25;\r\nninety-six verses (Scholz).\r\n\r\n24. Par. Nat. Gr. 178, Colbert. 4112 [xi, Greg. x], 10-¼ × 5-7/8, ff. 240,\r\nwith a commentary (Victor’s on St. Mark), _prol._, κεφ. _t._, κεφ., τίτλ.,\r\n_Am._, _Eus._, and also _syn._, but in a later hand. _Mut._ Matt, xxvii.\r\n20-Mark iv. 22; 186 verses (Griesb., Scholz). See Burgon, _ubi supra_, p.\r\n228. Used in Cramer’s Cat. on St. Mark, 1840 (Greg.).\r\n\r\n25. Par. Nat.

Matt. xxiii. 1-xxv. 42; Mark i. 1-vii. 36; Luke viii.\r\n31-41; ix. 44-54; x. 39-xi. 4; John xiii. 19?-xxi. 25 (Griesbach, Scholz,\r\nGreg., Martin).\r\n\r\n26. Par. Nat. Gr. 78, Colbert. 4078 [xi], 9-½ × 7-¼, ff. 179 (27), neatly\r\nand correctly written by Paul a priest. _Carp._, _Eus. t._, κεφ. _t._,\r\nτίτλ., _Am._, _lect._, _syn._, _men._ (Wetstein, Scholz, Greg.).\r\n\r\n27. Par. Nat. Gr. 115, Colbert. 6043 [xi, Greg. x], 6-¼ × 4-¾, ff. 460\r\n(19), is Mill’s Colb. 1. That critic procured Larroque’s collation of\r\nCodd. 27-33 (a very imperfect one) for his edition of the New Testament.\r\nFrom John xviii. 3 the text is supplied, cotton _chart_. [xiv]. κεφ. _t._,\r\n_pict._, κεφ., τίτλ., _Am._, _Eus._ (_syn._, _men._ later), _syn._,\r\n_pict._ Extensively altered by a later hand (Wetstein, Scholz, Greg.).\r\n\r\n28. Par. Nat. Gr. 379, Colbert. 4705 [xi], 9-1/8 × 7-1/8, ff. 292 (19), is\r\nMill’s Colb. 2, most carelessly written by an ignorant scribe; it often\r\nresembles Cod. D, but has many unique readings and interpolations, with\r\n“many relics of a very ancient text hereabouts” (Hort on Mark vi. 43,\r\nIntrod. p. 242). Κεφ. _t._ (inaccurate), κεφ., τίτλ., _Am._, _Eus._,\r\n_subscr._ (_lect._ later), _syn. Mut._ in 334 verses, viz. Matt. vii.\r\n17-ix. 12; xiv. 33-xvi. 10; xxvi. 70-xxvii. 48; Luke xx. 19-xxii. 46; John\r\nxii. 40-xiii. 1; xv. 24-xvi. 12; xviii. 16-28; xx. 20-xxi. 5; 18-25\r\n(Scholz, Greg.).\r\n\r\n29. Par. Nat. Gr. 89, Colbert. 6066 [xii, Greg. x], 7-1/8 × 5-½, ff. 169,\r\nis Mill’s Colb. 3, correctly written by a Latin scribe, with very many\r\npeculiar corrections by a later hand. Lost leaves in the three later\r\nGospels are supplied [xv]. Scholia, _Eus. t._, _prol._, κεφ., τίτλ.,\r\n_Am._, _Eus._, _subscr._, _syn._, _men._ Mut. Matt. i-xv. Mill compares\r\nits text with that of Cod. 71 (Scholz, Greg.).\r\n\r\n30. Par. Nat. Gr. 100, Colbert. 4444 [xvi, Greg. xv], 8-7/8 × 5-7/8,\r\n_chart._, ff. 313 (18), κεφ. (Gr. and Lat.), τίτλ., is Mill’s Colb. 4,\r\ncontaining all the Gospels, by the writer of Cod. 70. In text it much\r\nresembles Cod. 17 (Scholz, Greg.).\r\n\r\n31. Par. Nat. Gr. 94, Colbert. 6083 [xiii], 7-1/8 × 5-½, ff. 188, _pict._,\r\nκεφ. _t._, κεφ., τίτλ., is also Mill’s Colb. 4, but contains all the\r\nGospels with prayers. This copy has many erasures (Scholz, Greg.).\r\n\r\n32. Par. Nat. Gr. 116, Colbert. 6511 [xii], 5-¾ × 4-¼, ff. 244 (21),\r\n_prol._, κεφ. _t._, κεφ., τίτλ., _Am._ (_lect._ and ἀναγν. later), is\r\nMill’s Colb. 5. It begins Matt. x. 22. _Mut._ Matt. xxiv. 15-30; Luke\r\nxxii. 35-John iv. 20 (Scholz). Mill misrepresented the contents of Codd.\r\n30-32, through supposing that they contained no more than the small\r\nportions which were collated for his use.\r\n\r\n*33. (Act. 13, Paul 17.) Par. Nat. Gr. 14, Colbert. 2844 [xi, Greg. ix or\r\nx], fol., 14-¾ × 9-¾, ff. 143 (52), κεφ., τίτλ., is Mill’s Colb. 8,\r\ncontaining some of the Prophets and all the New Testament, except Mark ix.\r\n31-xi. 11; xiii. 11-xiv. 60; Luke xxi. 38-xxiii. 26; and the Apocalypse.\r\nIn text it resembles Codd. BDL more than any other cursive manuscript.\r\nAfter Larroque, Wetstein, Griesbach, Begtrup, and Scholz, it was most\r\nlaboriously collated by Tregelles in 1850. There are fifty-two long lines\r\nin each page, in a fine round hand, the accents being sometimes neglected,\r\nand _eta_ unusually like our English letter h. The ends of the leaves are\r\nmuch damaged, and greatly misplaced by the binder; so that the Gospels now\r\nstand last, though on comparing the style of handwriting (which undergoes\r\na _gradual_ change throughout the volume) at their beginning and end with\r\nthat in the Prophets which stand first, and that in the Epistles which\r\nshould follow them, it is plain that they originally occupied their usual\r\nplace. The ink too, by reason of the damp, has often left its proper page\r\nblank, so that the writing can only be read _set off_ on the opposite\r\npage, especially in the Acts. Hence it is no wonder that Tregelles should\r\nsay that of all the manuscripts he has collated “none has ever been so\r\nwearisome to the eyes, and exhaustive of every faculty of attention.”\r\n(Account of the Printed Text, p. 162.)\r\n\r\nThe next eight copies, like Cod. H of St. Paul, belonged to that noble\r\ncollection made by the Chancellor Seguier, and on his death in 1672\r\nbequeathed to Coislin, Bishop of Metz. Montfaucon has described them in\r\nhis “Bibliotheca Coisliniana,” fol. 1715, and all were slightly collated\r\nby Wetstein and Scholz.\r\n\r\n34. Par. Nat. Coislin. 195, formerly 306 [xi, Greg. x], 11-¼ × 7-½, ff.\r\n469 (22), _Carp._, _Eus. t._, _prol._, _pict._, κεφ., τίτλ., _Am._,\r\n_subscr._, στίχ.; “a grand folio, splendidly written and in splendid\r\ncondition” (Burgon), from Mount Athos, has a catena (Victor’s commentary\r\non St. Mark) resembling that of Cod. 194. Fresh as from the artist’s hand.\r\n\r\n35. (Act. 14, Paul. 18, Apoc. 17.) Par. Nat. Coislin. 199, formerly 44\r\n[xi], 7-3/8 × 5-½, ff. 328 (27), κεφ. _t._, _lect._, ἀναγν., _syn._,\r\n_men._, _subscr._, στίχ., contains the whole New Testament (_see_ p. 72,\r\nnote), with many corrections.\r\n\r\n36. Par. Nat. Coislin. 20, formerly 26 [xi, Greg. x], 11-½ × 8-3/8, ff.\r\n509 (19), _Carp._, _Eus. t._, κεφ. _t._, _prol._, _pict._, κεφ., τίτλ.,\r\n_Am._, _Eus. t._, _prol._, with a commentary (Victor’s on St. Mark), from\r\nthe _laura_ [i.e. convent, Suicer, Thes. Eccles. tom. ii. 205] of St.\r\nAthanasius in Mount Athos, very sumptuous.\r\n\r\n37. Par. Nat. Coislin. 21, formerly 238 [xii], 12-1/8 × 9-½, ff. 357,\r\n_Eus. t._, κεφ. _t._, _prol._, _pict._, κεφ., τίτλ., _Am._, _Eus._, with\r\nshort scholia, Victor’s commentary on St. Mark, _Eus. t._, _syn._,\r\n_prol._, _pict._ (Montfaucon).\r\n\r\n38. (Act. 19, Paul. 23.) Par. Nat. Coislin. 200, formerly 500 [xiii],\r\n6-7/8 × 5-3/8, ff. 300 (30), copied for the Emperor Michael Palaeologus\r\n[1259-1282], and by him sent to St. Louis [d. 1270], containing all the N.\r\nT. except St. Paul’s Epistles, has been rightly judged by Wetstein to be\r\nStephen’s θ᾽(228). _Pict._, κεφ., τίτλ., _Am._ (not _Eus._), _mut._ 143\r\nverses; Matt. xiv. 15-xv. 30; xx. 14-xxi. 27; Mark xii. 3-xiii. 4. A\r\nfacsimile of this beautiful book is given in the “Paléographie Univers.,”\r\nNo. 84 (collated by Wetstein). Burgon has also a photograph of it, and,\r\nlike Wetstein and Silvestre, notices that it was Ex Bibl. Pattr.\r\nCadomensium [Caen] Soc. Jesu, 1640.\r\n\r\n39. Par. Nat. Coislin. 23, formerly 315 [xi], 13-1/8 × 10-¼, ff. 288, κεφ.\r\n_t._ (_see_ Greg.), κεφ., τίτλ., _Am._, _subscr._, στίχ., written at\r\nConstantinople with many abbreviations εἰς τὸ πατριαρχεῖον, ἐπὶ Σεργίου\r\n[II] τοῦ πατριάρχου, and in 1218 conveyed to the convent of St. Athanasius\r\non Mount Athos. With a commentary (Victor’s on St. Mark, from the same\r\noriginal as that in Cod. 34). Not _written_ by Sergius, as Scholz says\r\n(Burgon).\r\n\r\n40. Par. Nat. Coislin. 22, formerly 375 [xi], 11-¾ × 8-½, ff. 312,\r\n_Carp._, _Eus. t._, _prol._, κεφ. _t._, κεφ., τίτλ., _Am._, _Eus._, once\r\nbelonged to the monastery of St. Nicholas σταυρονικήτας, with a commentary\r\n(Victor’s on St. Mark) and _Eus. t._ Ends at John xx. 25.\r\n\r\n41. Par. Nat. Coislin. 24, formerly 241 [xi], 4to, 12 x 9-½, ff. 224 (32),\r\nκεφ. _t._ (Mark), κεφ., τίτλ., _lect._, _subscr._, στίχ., contains SS.\r\nMatthew and Mark with a commentary (Victor’s on St. Mark).\r\n\r\n42. Cod. Medicaeus exhibits many readings of the same class as Codd. 1,\r\n13, 33, but its authority has the less weight, since it has disappeared\r\nunder circumstances somewhat suspicious. Edward Bernard communicated to\r\nMill these readings, which he had found in the hand of Peter Pithaeus, a\r\nformer owner, in the margin of Stephen’s N. T. of 1550: they professed to\r\nbe extracted from an “exemplar Regium Medicaeum” (which may be supposed to\r\nmean that portion of the King’s Library which Catherine de’ Medici brought\r\nto France: above, p. 117, note 3), and were inserted under the title of\r\n_Med._ in Mill’s great work, though he remarked their resemblance to the\r\ntext of Cod. K (N. T., Proleg. § 1462). The braggart Denis Amelotte\r\n[1606-78] professes to have used the manuscript about the middle of the\r\nseventeenth century, and states that it was in a college at Troyes; but\r\nScholz could find it neither in that city nor elsewhere.\r\n\r\n43. (Act. 54, Paul. 130.) Par. Biblioth. Armament. 8409, 8410, formerly\r\nGr. 4 [xi], in two volumes; the first containing the Gospels with _Eus.\r\nt._, the second the Acts and Epistles, 8-1/8 × 6-3/8, ff. 199 (23) and 190\r\n(25), _Carp._, _Eus. t._, _prol._, κεφ. _t._, κεφ., τίτλ., _Am._, _Eus._,\r\n_subscr._ (_lect._ and ἀναγν. later, _see_ Greg.). Perhaps written at\r\nEphesus; given by P. de Berzi in 1661 to the Oratory of San Maglorian\r\n(Amelotte, Simon, Scholz).\r\n\r\n44. Lond.

Oxford Bodleian Barocc. 31 [xii or xiii], 7-¼ × 5-¼, ff. 399 (20), is\r\nMill’s Bodl. 1, a very neat copy, with _Eus. t._, κεφ. _t._, κεφ., τίτλ.\r\n(occasional), _Am._, _Eus._, _lect._ (here and there), _subscr._, στίχ.\r\n_Mut._ Mark ii. 5-15 (Mill, Griesbach).\r\n\r\n46.

It contains many\r\nunusual readings (Mill, Griesbach).\r\n\r\n51. (Act. 32, Paul. 38.) Oxf. Bodl. Laud. Gr. 31, formerly C. 63 [xiii],\r\n11-¾ × 8-¾, ff. 325 (28), 2 cols., Mill’s Laud. 2, whose resemblance to\r\nthe Complutensian text is pointed out by him (N. T., Proleg. § 1437),\r\nthough, judging from his own collation of Cod. 51, his statement “per\r\nomnia penè respondet” is rather too strong. _Prol._, κεφ. _t._, κεφ.,\r\nτίτλ., _Am._ (not _Eus._), _lect._, _syn._, _men._, _subscr._ The\r\n_present_ order of the contents (_see_ p. 72) is Act., Paul., Cath.,\r\nEvangelia (Mill, Griesbach): but it ought to be collated afresh. This is\r\nBentley’s γ in the unpublished margin of B. xvii. 5 at Trin. Coll.,\r\nCambridge. He calls it a quarto, 400 years old. _Mut._ 2 Pet. iii. 2-17;\r\nMatt. xviii. 12-35; Mark ii. 8-iii. 4 (_see_ Codd. 54, 60, 113, 440, 507,\r\n508, Acts 23, Apoc. 28, Evst. 5).\r\n\r\n52. Oxf. Bodl. Laud. Gr. 3, formerly C. 28 [dated A.D. 1286], 6-½ × 5, ff.\r\n158 (27), elegant, written by νικητας ὁ μαυρωνης, is Mill’s Laud. 5, with\r\n_Pict._, _prol._, κεφ. _t._, κεφ., τίτλ., _Am._, _Eus._, _lect._,\r\n_subscr._, _mut._ in initio (Mill, Griesbach).\r\n\r\n53. Oxf. Bodl. Seld. supr. 28, formerly 3416 [xiv], 6 × 4-¾, ff. 140, is\r\nMill’s Seld. 1, who pronounces it much like Stephen’s γ᾽ (Cod. 4), having\r\n_prol._, κεφ. _t._, κεφ., τίτλ., _subscr._, ἀναγν., beautifully written\r\n(Mill, Griesbach).\r\n\r\n54. Oxf. Bodl.

Seld. supr. 6 (Coxe 5), formerly 3394, Mill’s Seld. 3\r\n[xiii], 4to, 7-½ × 5-½, ff. 349 (21), containing also Judges vi. 1-24\r\n(Grabe, Prol. V. T., tom. i. cap. iii. § 6), has _prol._ in Matt., κεφ.\r\n_t._, _pict._, κεφ., _lect._, _syn._, _men._, ἀναγν., _subscr._, στίχ.\r\n(Mill).\r\n\r\n56. Oxf. Lincoln Coll. II (Gr.) 18 [xv or xvi], 4to, 8-1/8 × 5-5/8, ff.\r\n232 (24), _chart._, was presented about 1502, by Edmund Audley, Bishop of\r\nSalisbury: _prol._ (Mark, Luke), κεφ. _t._, κεφ., some τίτλ., ἀναγν.,\r\n_vers._, titles to Gospels, _subscr._, στίχ. (John). Walton gives some\r\nvarious readings, but confounds it with Act. 33, Paul. 39, speaking of\r\nthem as if one “vetustissimum exemplar.” It has been inspected by Dobbin,\r\nScrivener, and Mill, but so loosely that the late Rev. R. C. Pascoe,\r\nFellow of Exeter College, detected thirty-four omissions for thirty-one\r\ncitations (one of them being an error) in four chapters.\r\n\r\n57. (Act. 85, Paul. 41.) Oxf. Magdalen Coll., Greek 9 [xii, opening], 9 ×\r\n7-½, ff. 291 (25), _aur._ beautiful, in a small and beautiful hand, with\r\nabbreviations. _Mut._ Mark i. 1-11, and at end. Psalms and Hymns follow\r\nthe Epistles. It has κεφ. _t._, κεφ., τίτλ. (_lect._ in red, _vers._\r\nlater). Collated twice by Dr. Hammond, the great commentator, whose papers\r\nseem to have been used for Walton’s Polyglott (Magd. 1): also examined by\r\nDobbin (Mill).\r\n\r\n58. Oxf. New Coll. 68 [xv], 7-¾ × 5-¼, ff. 342 (20), is Walton and Mill’s\r\nN. 1. This, like Codd. 56-7, has been accurately examined by Dr. Dobbin,\r\nfor the purpose of his “Collation of the Codex Montfortianus” (London,\r\n1854), with whose readings Codd. 56, 58 have been compared in 1922 places.\r\nHe has undoubtedly proved the close connexion subsisting between the three\r\nmanuscripts (which had been observed by Mill, N. T. Proleg. § 1388),\r\nthough he may not have quite demonstrated that they must be direct\r\ntranscripts from each other. _Prol._, κεφ. _t._, κεφ. (partially), τίτλ.,\r\n_Am._ (partial), ἀναγν. (partial), _syn._, _subscr._ (Mark), _vers._, with\r\nscholia. The writing is very careless, and those are in error who follow\r\nWalton in stating that it contains the Acts and Epistles (Walton’s\r\nPolyglott, Mill, Dobbin). Mr. C. Forster rightly asks for photographs and\r\na thorough re-collation of Codd. 56, 58, 61, “to throw light upon their\r\ndirect relationship, or non-relationship to each other” (“A New Plea for\r\nthe Three Heavenly Witnesses,” 1867, p. 139). Dr. C. R. Gregory has\r\nexpressed the opinion that Codd. 47, 56, 58 are in the same hand, and one\r\nof them copied from Cod. 54.\r\n\r\n*59. Cambridge, Gonville and Caius Coll. 403 [xii], 8 × 6, ff. 238 (23),\r\nan important copy, “textu notabili,” as Tischendorf states (much like D,\r\n61, 71), but carelessly written, and exhibiting no less than eighty-one\r\nomissions by ὁμοιοτέλευτον (_see_ p. 9). It was very poorly examined for\r\nWalton’s Polyglott, better though defectively by Mill, seen by Wetstein in\r\n1716, minutely collated by Scrivener in 1860. It once belonged to the\r\nHouse of Friars Minor at Oxford, from whence Richard Brynkley borrowed it\r\nand took it to the Grey Friars at Cambridge, whence it went to Thomas\r\nHatcher, who gave it to the College in 1867 (J. Rendel Harris, The origin\r\nof the Leicester Codex, 1887). It has τίτλ., κεφ., _Am._ (but not _Eus._),\r\nand exhibits many and rare _compendia scribendi_.\r\n\r\n60. (Apoc. 10.) Camb. University Library, Dd. ix. 69 [A.D. 1297], 8 × 6,\r\nff. 324 = 293 + 1 + 30 (24), but the Apocalypse is later, and has a few\r\nscholia from Arethas about it. This copy is Mill’s Moore 1(230) and is\r\nstill badly known. _Carp._, _Eus. t._, κεφ. _t._, _pict._, κεφ., τίτλ.,\r\n_lect._ (later), _Am._ without _Eus._, _subscr._, and it is an elegant\r\ncopy (Mill). The Gospels appear to have been written in the East, the\r\nApocalypse in the West of Europe. This is Bentley’s ε (_see_ Cod. 51).\r\n\r\n*61. (Act. 34, Paul. 40, Apoc. 92.) Codex Montfortianus at Trinity\r\nCollege, Dublin, G. 97 [xv or xvi], 6-¼ × 4-¾, ff. 445 (21), _chart._, so\r\ncelebrated in the controversy respecting 1 John v. 7. Its last collator,\r\nDr. Orlando Dobbin (_see_ on Cod. 58), has discussed in his Introduction\r\nevery point of interest connected with it. It contains the whole New\r\nTestament, apparently the work of three or four successive scribes, paper\r\nleaves, only one of them—that on which 1 John v. 7 stands—being\r\nglazed(231), as if to protect it from harm. This manuscript was first\r\nheard of between the publication of Erasmus’ second (1519) and third\r\n(1522) editions of his N. T., and after he had publicly declared, in\r\nanswer to objectors, that if any _Greek_ manuscript could be found\r\ncontaining the passage, he would insert it in his revision of the text; a\r\npromise which he fulfilled in 1522. Erasmus describes his authority as\r\n“Codex Britannicus,” “apud Anglos repertus,” and there is the fullest\r\nreason to believe that the Cod. Montfortianus is the copy referred to\r\n(_see_ Vol. II. Chap. XI). Its earliest known owner was Froy(232), a\r\nFranciscan friar, then Thomas Clement [fl. 1569], then William Chark [fl.\r\n1582], then Thomas Montfort, D.D. of Cambridge, from whom it derives its\r\nname, then Archbishop Ussher, who caused the collation to be made which\r\nappears in Walton’s Polyglott (Matt. i. 1-Acts xxii. 29; Rom. i), and\r\npresented the manuscript to Trinity College. Dr. Barrett appended to his\r\nedition of Cod. Z a full collation of the parts left untouched by his\r\npredecessors; but since the work of Ussher’s friends was known to be very\r\ndefective, Dobbin has re-collated the whole of that portion which Barrett\r\nleft unexamined, comparing the readings throughout with Codd. 56, 58 of\r\nthe Gospels, and Cod. 33 of the Acts. This copy has _prol._, κεφ. _t._,\r\nκεφ., τίτλ., _Am._, _Eus._, _subscr._, στίχ., besides which the division\r\nby the Latin chapters in St. Mark is employed, a sure proof—if any were\r\nneeded—of the modern date of the manuscript. There are many corrections by\r\na more recent hand, erasures by the pen, &c. It has been supposed that the\r\nGospels were first written; then the Acts and Epistles (transcribed, in\r\nDobbin’s judgement, from Cod. 33, Acts); the Apocalypse last; having been\r\nadded about 1580, as Tregelles and Dr. Dobbin think, from Cod. 69, when\r\nthey were both in Chark’s possession. The text, however, of the Apocalypse\r\nis not quite the same in the two codices, nor would it be easy, without\r\nseeing them together, to verify Dobbin’s conjecture, that the titles to\r\nthe sacred books, in pale red ink, were added by the same person in both\r\nmanuscripts. In the margin of this copy, as of Cod. 69, are inserted many\r\nreadings in Chark’s handwriting, even the misprint of Erasmus, ἐμαῖς for\r\nἐν αἷς, Apoc. ii. 13.\r\n\r\n62. Walton’s _Goog._, which was brought from the East, and once belonged\r\nto Dr. Henry Googe, Fellow of Trinity College. The collations of Codd. D,\r\n59, 61, 62 made for the London Polyglott were given in 1667 to Emmanuel\r\nCollege, where they yet remain. _Goog._ was identified with the Cambridge\r\nKk. v. 35 by Bp. Marsh, who was a little careless in this kind of work.\r\n\r\n622. Camb. Univ. Lib. Kk. v. 35 [xv], 9-¼ × 5-¾, ff. 403 (14), _chart._,\r\nκεφ., (κεφ. Lat.), τίτλ., _subscr._, _vers._ Mr. Bradshaw has pointed out\r\nthat Kk. v. 35 is a mere transcript by George Hermonymus from Cod. 70 also\r\nin his handwriting, and hastily copied from it, errors of the pen and all.\r\nIt has no _men._, _lect._, as _Goog._ had, but the ordinary κεφάλαια and\r\n_Latin_ chapters. Again, _Goog._, as Walton says, “ex Oriente advectus\r\nest,” and must have been in England before 1657; whereas Bp. Moore got Kk.\r\nv. 35 from France in 1706, with other books from the collection of J. B.\r\nHantin, the numismatist.\r\n\r\n63. Cod. Ussher 1, Trin. Coll. Dublin, A. i. 8, formerly D. 20 [x], fol.,\r\nwith a commentary, 12-3/8 × 9-½, ff. 237 (18-24), _prol._, κεφ. _t._,\r\n_pict._, κεφ., τίτλ., _Am._, _Eus._ (_lect._, later.), _subscr._ Henry\r\nDodwell made a few extracts for Bishop Fell’s N. T. of 1675; Richard\r\nBulkeley loosely collated it for Mill, Dr. Dobbin in 1855 examined St.\r\nMatthew, and the Rev. John Twycross, of the Charter House, re-collated the\r\nwhole manuscript in 1858. The last leaf, containing John xxi. 25, is lost;\r\nbut (_see_ Scrivener, Cod. Sin., Introd., p. lix, note, and an admirable\r\npaper by Dr. Gwynn in _Hermathena_, xix, 1893, p. 368) it originally\r\ncontained the verse and witnesses to it. Dr. C. R. Gregory has noticed in\r\nCod. 63 a mutilated double leaf of an Evangelistarium in two columns [ix\r\nor x], containing part of ὥρα γ᾽.\r\n\r\n64. Bute, formerly Ussher 2. This MS. belonged, like the preceding, to the\r\nillustrious Primate of Ireland, but has been missing from Trin. Coll.\r\nLibrary in Dublin ever since 1742, or, as Dr. C. R. Gregory thinks on the\r\nauthority of Dr. T. K. Abbott, 1702. It was collated, like Cod. 63, by\r\nDodwell for Fell, by Bulkeley for Mill. It once belonged to Dr. Thomas\r\nGoad, and was very neatly, though incorrectly, written in octavo. As the\r\nEmmanuel College copy of the Epistles (Act. 53, Paul. 30) never contained\r\nthe Gospels, for which it is perpetually cited in Walton’s Polyglott as\r\n_Em._, the strong resemblance subsisting between _Usser._ 2 and _Em._ led\r\nMill to suspect that they were in fact the same copy. The result of an\r\nexamination of Walton’s with Mill’s collations is that they are in\r\nnumberless instances cited together in support of readings, in company\r\nwith other manuscripts; often with a very few or even alone (e.g. Matt.\r\nvi. 22; viii. 11; xii. 41; Mark ii. 2; iv. 1; ix. 10; 25; Luke iv. 32;\r\nviii. 27; John i. 21; iv. 24; v. 7; 20; 36; vii. 10; xvi. 19; xxi. 1).\r\nThat _Usser._ 2 and _Em._ are sometimes alleged separately is easily\r\naccounted for by the inveterate want of accuracy exhibited by all early\r\ncollators. But all doubt is at an end since Dean Burgon in 1880 found this\r\ncelebrated copy in the library of the Marquis of Bute, and has traced the\r\ncurious history of its rovings. From Dr. Goad (d. 1638) it came into the\r\nkeeping of Primate Ussher, by whose hand the modern chapters seem to have\r\nbeen written in the margin. Then towards the end of the seventeenth\r\ncentury (as his signature proves) it belonged to one John Jones: a later\r\nhand puts in the date Saturday, May 25, 1728. It has also the book plate\r\nof John Earl of Moira (d. 1793). Then we trace it to James Verschoyle,\r\nafterwards Bishop of Killala from 1793 to 1834, thence to the Earls of\r\nHuntingdon for two generations, when it was purchased at the Donnington\r\nPark sale by Lord Bute. Without doubt this is the long lost Cod. 64, the\r\n_Usser._ 2 and _Em._ of Mill: it was recognized at once by the reading in\r\nJohn viii. 8. Dean Burgon describes it as [xii or xiii] now in two\r\nvolumes, bound in red morocco about 150 years since. It has 440 leaves,\r\n4-3/5 inches by 3-2/5 in size. _Carp._, _Eus. t._, κεφ. _t._, τίτλ., κεφ.,\r\n_Am._ (gilt), _Eus._ (carmine), _lect._, ἀρχαί and τελη. At the end are\r\nfourteen leaves of _syn._ Though beautifully written, it has no _pict._ or\r\nelaborate headings. Previous collators had done their work very poorly, as\r\nwe have reason to know. Out of about sixty variations in Mark i-v, Mill\r\nhas recorded only twenty-six. Over each proper name of a _person_ stands a\r\nlittle waved stroke: cf. Evan. 530. (Collated for Burgon.)\r\n\r\n65. Lond. Brit. Mus. Harleian 5776 [xiii], 9 x 7, ff. 309 (22), is Mill’s\r\nCov. 1, brought from the East in 1677 with four other manuscripts of the\r\nGreek Testament by Dr. John Covell [1637-1722], once English Chaplain at\r\nConstantinople, then Chaplain to Queen Mary at the Hague, afterwards\r\nMaster of Christ’s College, Cambridge. _Carp._, _Eus. t._, κεφ. _t._,\r\nκεφ., τίτλ., _Am._, _Eus._, στίχ., _subscr._ (Mill). This book was\r\npresented to Covell in 1674 by Daniel, Bishop of Proconnesus. The last\r\nverse is supplied by a late hand, the concluding leaf being lost, as in\r\nCod. 63.\r\n\r\n*66. Camb. Trin. Coll. O. viii. 3, Cod. Galei Londinensis [xii], 8-¾ x 6,\r\n_chart._, ff. 282 (21), _pict._, _syn._, _men._, _Carp._ ten blank pages,\r\nκεφ., no τίτλ., _lect._, _Am._, _Eus._, _subscr._ (later), ἀναγν., κεφ.\r\n_t._, στίχ., once belonged to Th. Gale [1636-1702], High Master of St.\r\nPaul’s School, Dean of York (1697), with some scholia in the margin by a\r\nrecent hand, and other changes in the text by one much earlier. Known to\r\n(Mill), but for a time lost sight of. Collated by Scrivener, 1862.\r\nInserted in the great printed Catalogue of Manuscripts, Oxford, 1697.\r\n\r\n67. Oxf. Bodl. Misc. Gr. 76 [x or xi], 9 x 7, ff. 202 (20), 2 cols., is\r\nMill’s Hunt. 2, brought from the East by Dr. Robert Huntington, Chaplain\r\nat Aleppo, Provost of Trinity College, Dublin, and afterwards Bishop of\r\nRaphoe [d. 1701]. _Mut._ John vi. 64-xxi. 25. _Eus. t._, _pict._, κεφ.\r\n_t._, κεφ., τίτλ., _Am._, _Eus._, _lect._, _subscr._ On f. 3, the\r\nAthanasian Creed is on _rect._ on gold ground (Mill).\r\n\r\n68. Oxf. Lincoln Coll. (Evst. 199) II. Gr. 17 [xii], 8 x 5, ff. 29 (23),\r\n_Carp._, _Eus. t._, κεφ. _t._, _orn._, κεφ., τίτλ. (gold), _Am._, _lect._,\r\nστιχ., besides _syn._, _men._, and verses at the end of each Gospel by\r\nTheodulos Hieromonachus, is Mill’s Wheel. 1, brought from Zante in 1676,\r\nwith two other copies, by George Wheeler, Canon of Durham. Between the\r\nGospels of SS. Luke and John are small fragments of two leaves of a\r\nbeautiful Evangelistarium [ix?], with red musical notes (Mill, Scr.).\r\n\r\n*69. (Act. 31, Paul. 37, Apoc. 14.) Codex Leicestrensis [xiv Harris; end\r\nof xv], 14-½ x 10-5/8, ff. 213 (38), like Codd. 206 and 233, and Brit.\r\nMus. Harl. 3161; rapidly written on 83 leaves of vellum and 130 of paper,\r\nthe vellum being outside the quinion at beginning and end, and three paper\r\nleaves within (_see_ p. 24), apparently with a reed (_see_ p. 27), is now\r\nin the library of the Town Council of Leicester. It contains the whole New\r\nTestament, except Matt. i. 1-xviii. 15; Acts x. 45-xiv. 17; Jude 7-25;\r\nApoc. xviii. 7-xxii. 21, but with fragments down to xix. 10. The original\r\norder was Paul., Acts, Cath. Epp., Apoc., Gospels last and missing when\r\nthe MS. came into Chark’s hands. Written in the strange hand which our\r\nfacsimile exhibits (No. 40), _epsilon_ being recumbent and almost like\r\n_alpha_, and with accents placed over the succeeding consonant instead of\r\nthe vowel(233). The words Ειμι Ιλερμον Χαρκου at the top of the first\r\npage, in the same beautiful hand that wrote many (too many) marginal\r\nnotes, prove that this codex once belonged to the William Chark, mentioned\r\nunder Cod. 61 (p. 201) who got it from Brynkley, who probably got it like\r\nthe Caius MS. (Evan. 59) from the Convent of Grey Friars at Cambridge. In\r\n1641 (Wetstein states 1669) Thomas Hayne, M.A., of Trussington, in that\r\ncounty, gave this MS. with his other books to the Leicester Library. Mill\r\nwas permitted to use it at Oxford, and collated it there in 1671. A\r\ncollation also made by John Jackson and William Tiffin was lent to\r\nWetstein through Caesar de Missy and Th. Gee, a Presbyterian minister of\r\nBut Close, Leicester. Tregelles re-collated it in 1852 for his edition of\r\nthe Greek Testament, and Scrivener very minutely in 1855; the latter\r\npublished his results, with a full description of the book itself, in the\r\nAppendix to his “Codex Augiensis.” No manuscript of its age has a text so\r\nremarkable as this, less however in the Acts than in the Gospels. Though\r\nnone of the ordinary divisions into sections, and scarcely any liturgical\r\nmarks, occur throughout, there is evidently a close connexion between Cod.\r\n69 and the Church Service-books, as well in the interpolations of proper\r\nnames, particles of time, or whole passages (e.g. Luke xxii. 43, 44 placed\r\nafter Matt. xxvi. 39) which are common to both, as especially in the\r\ntitles of the Gospels: ἐκ τοῦ κατὰ μάρκον εὐαγγέλιον (_sic_), &c., being\r\nin the very language of the Lectionaries(234). Codd. 178, 443 have the\r\nsame peculiarity. Tables of κεφάλαια stand before the three later Gospels,\r\nwith very unusual variations; for which, as well as for the foreign matter\r\ninserted and other peculiarities of Cod. 69, consult Scrivener’s Cod.\r\nAugiensis (Introd. pp. xl-xlvii). See also Mr. J. Rendel Harris, Origin of\r\nthe Leicester Codex, 1887.\r\n\r\n70. Camb. Univ. Lib. Ll. ii. 13 [xv], 11-¼ x 7-¼ ff. 186 (23), _orn._,\r\nτίτλ. in margin, κεφ. Lat., _vers._, was written, like Codd. 30, 62, 287,\r\nby G. Hermonymus the Spartan (who settled at Paris, 1472, and became the\r\nGreek teacher of Budaeus and Reuchlin), for William Bodet; there are\r\nmarginal corrections by Budaeus, from whose letter to Bp. Tonstall we may\r\nfix the date about A.D. 1491-4. It once belonged to Bunckle of London,\r\nthen to Bp. Moore. Like Cod. 62 it has the Latin chapters (Mill).\r\n\r\n*71. Lambeth 528 [A.D. 1100], 6-½ x 4-¾, ff. 265 (26), is Mill’s _Eph._\r\nand Scrivener’s g. This elegant copy, which once belonged to an Archbishop\r\nof Ephesus, was brought to England in 1675 by Philip Traheron, English\r\nChaplain at Smyrna. Traheron made a careful collation of his manuscript,\r\nof which both the rough copy (B. M., Burney 24) and a fair one (Lambeth\r\n528 b) survive. This last Scrivener in 1845 compared with the original,\r\nand revised, especially in regard to later corrections, of which there are\r\nmany. Mill used Traheron’s collation very carelessly. _Carp._, _Eus. t._,\r\nκεφ. _t._ [xv], κεφ., τίτλ., _Am._, _Eus._, _lect._ This copy presents a\r\ntext full of interest, and much superior to that of the mass of\r\nmanuscripts of its age. _See_ Cod. 29.\r\n\r\n72. Brit. Mus. Harleian. 5647 [xi], large 4to, 10 x 8, ff. 268 (22, 24),\r\nan elegant copy, with a catena on St. Matthew, κεφ. _t._, _pict._, κεφ.,\r\nτίτλ., _lect._, _Am._, _Eus._, _subscr._, στίχ. (Mark), various readings\r\nin the ample margin. Lent by T. Johnson to (Wetstein).\r\n\r\n73. Christ Church, Oxford, Wake 26 [xi], 4to, 9-7/8 x 8-1/8, ff. 291, κεφ.\r\n_t._, _Eus. t._, _vers._, κεφ., _Am._, _Eus._, τίτλ., _pict._, few _lect._\r\nIt is marked “Ex dono Mauri Cordati Principis Hungaro-Walachiae, Ao 1724.”\r\nThis and Cod. 74 were once Archbishop Wake’s, and were collated for\r\nWetstein by (Jo. Walker, _Wake MS._ 35)(235).\r\n\r\n74. Christ Church, Oxford, Wake 20 [xiii], 8 x 6, ff. 204, written by\r\nTheodore (_see_ p. 42, note 3). _Mut._ Matt. i. 1-14; v. 29-vi. 1;\r\nthirty-two verses. It came in 1727 from the Monastery of Παντοκράτωρ, on\r\nMount Athos. _Carp._, _Eus. t._, κεφ. _t._, _syn._, _men._, κεφ., τίτλ.,\r\n_Am._, _Eus._, _lect._, _subscr._, _vers._\r\n\r\n75. Cod.

Seen in 1714 by Wetstein, examined by\r\nScholz (collated Matt. i-vi, John vii, viii), collated (Matt. i-xviii,\r\nMark i-v) by Cellérier, a Professor at Geneva, whose collation (Matt.\r\ni-xviii) is corrected and supplemented with Matt. xix-end by H. C.\r\nHoskier, though his visit to the MS. was unfortunately short. The first\r\ndiorthota made corrections and additions as regards breathings and stops.\r\nOther corrections made not much later (Hoskier, Collation of 604, App. G).\r\n\r\n76. (Act. 43, Paul. 49.) Cod. Caesar-Vindobonensis, Nessel. 300, Lambec.\r\n28 [xi-xiii], 7-½ x 5-3/8, ff. 358 (27), _prol._, κεφ. _t._, κεφ., τίτλ.,\r\n_Am._, _lect._, _syn._, _men._, _pict._ This copy (the only one known to\r\nread αὐτῆς with the Complutensian and other editions in Luke ii. 22) is\r\nerroneously called an uncial by Mill (Gerhard à Mastricht 1690; Ashe 1691;\r\nF. K. Alter 1786) (Greg.).\r\n\r\n77. Caesar-Vindobon. Nessel. 114, Lambec. 29 [xi], 9-¼ x 8, ff. 300 (21),\r\nvery neat; with a commentary (Victor’s on St. Mark), _Carp._, _Eus. t._,\r\n_prol._, κεφ. _t._, κεφ., τίτλ., _Am._, _Eus._ (_lect._ and _syn._ by a\r\nlater hand). It once belonged to Matthias Corvinus, the great king of\r\nHungary (1458-90). Collated in “Tentamen descriptionis codicum,” &c. 1773\r\nby (Treschow, and also by Alter) (Greg.).\r\n\r\n78. Cod. Nicolae Jancovich de Vadass, now in Hungary [xii], 9-1/8 × 5-¾,\r\nff. 293 (22), _Eus. t._, κεφ. _t._, τίτλ., κεφ., _lect._, _syn._, _pict._\r\nIt was once in the library of king Matthias Corvinus: on the sack of Buda\r\nby the Turks in 1527, his noble collection of 50,000 volumes was\r\nscattered, and about 1686 this book fell into the hands of S. B., then of\r\nJ. G., Carpzov of Leipsic, at whose sale it was purchased and brought back\r\nto its former country. A previous possessor, in the seventeenth century,\r\nwas Γεώργιος δεσμοφύλαξ Ναυπλίου. (Collated by C. F. Boerner for Kuster,\r\nand “in usum” of Scholz.)\r\n\r\n79. Leyden, Bibl. Univ. 74 [xv], Latin version older, 6-½ × 4-¾, ff. 208\r\n(26-28), 2 cols., κεφ., _lect._, ἀναγν. (all partial). _Mut._ Matt. i.\r\n1-xiv. 13. Brought by Georg. Douze from Constantinople in 1597, consulted\r\nby Gomar in 1644 (Greg.).\r\n\r\n80. Paris, Lesoeuf [xii], 9-1/8 × 6-3/8, ff. 309 (23), _prol._, κεφ. _t._,\r\nκεφ. (also Lat. cent, xv), τίτλ. This MS. belonged to J. G. Graevius, and\r\nwas collated by Bynaeus in 1691: then it passed into the hands of J. Van\r\nder Hagen, who showed it to Wetstein in 1739: afterwards it was bought by\r\nAmbrose Didot at a sale, and sold to Mons. Lesoeuf, where Dr. C. R.\r\nGregory saw it. (_See_ Proleg. to Tisch. ed. viii. p. 485.)\r\n\r\n81. Oxf. Bodl. Misc. Gr. 323, Auct. T. Infr. i. 5 [xiii], 7 × 5, ff. 182.\r\nΚεφ., τίτλ., some _Am._ Bought in 1883 from Mr. William Ward who brought\r\nit from Ephesus. Contains Matt. xix. 15-xxi. 19; 31-41; xxii. 7-xxviii.\r\n20; Mark i. 9-iii. 18; 35-xv. 15; 32-xvi. 14; Luke i. 18-ii. 19; iii.\r\n7-iv. 40; v. 8-xxii. 5; 36-xxiii. 10; John viii. 4-xxi. 18. This place has\r\nbeen hitherto occupied by Greek MSS. cited in a Correctorium Bibliorum\r\nLatinorum of the thirteenth century(236). Dr. Hort appropriates this\r\nnumeral to Muralt’s 2pe. (Evan. 473.)\r\n\r\n82. Oxf. Bodl. MS. Bibl. Gr. e. I. Some fragments: (1) John iii. 23; (2)\r\n26, 27; (3) 2 Cor. xi. 3: Chart. (1, 2) [xiii], (3) [vi or vii] uncials\r\nand minuscules intermixed, and some Coptic and Arabic words.\r\n\r\nIn this place other fragments have been placed till now. Seven unknown\r\nGreek manuscripts of St. John, three of St. Matthew and (apparently) of\r\nthe other Gospels, cited in Laurentius Valla’s “Annotationes in N. T., ex\r\ndiversorum utriusque linguae, Graecae et Latinae, codicum collatione,”\r\nwritten about 1440, edited by Erasmus, Paris 1505. His copies seem modern,\r\nand have probably been used by later critics. The whole subject, however,\r\nis very carefully examined in the Rev. A. T. Russell’s “Memoirs of the\r\nlife and works of Bp. Andrewes,” pp. 282-310. Hort’s Cod. 82 is Burgon’s\r\nVenet. xii, to be described hereafter.\r\n\r\n83. Cod. Monacensis 518 [xi], 8-½ × 6-½, ff. 321 (20), beautifully\r\nwritten, _prol._, κεφ. _t._, κεφ., _lect._, ἀναγν., _syn._, _men._,\r\n_subscr._, στίχ., in the Royal Library at Munich, whither it was brought\r\nfrom Augsburg (Bengel’s August. 1, Scholz, Greg.).\r\n\r\n84. Monacensis 568 [xii], 6-5/8 × 5-1/8, ff. 65, κεφ., τίτλ., _Am._ (not\r\n_Eus._), _lect._ both in the text and margin, contains SS. Matthew and\r\nMark. _Mut._ Matt. i. 18-xiii. 10; xiii. 27-42; xiv. 3-xviii. 25; xix.\r\n9-21; xxii. 4-Mark vii. 13 (Burgon, Greg.).\r\n\r\n85. Monacensis 569 [xiii], 5-½ × 3-¾, ff. 30, κεφ., _lect._ in vermilion,\r\nτίτλ., _Am._ (not _Eus._), contains only Matt. viii. 15-ix. 17; xvi.\r\n12-xvii. 20; xxiv. 26-45; xxvi. 25-54; Mark vi. 13-ix. 45; Luke iii.\r\n12-vi. 44; John ix. 11-xii. 5; xix. 6-24; xx. 23-xxi. 9 (Bengel’s August.\r\n3, Scholz).\r\n\r\n86. Posoniensis Lycaei Aug. [x], 9-½ × 7-1/8, ff. 280, _prol._, _Eus. t._,\r\n_pict._, _syn._ Once at Buda, but it had been bought in 1183 at\r\nConstantinople for the Emperor Alexius II Comnenus (Bengel, Endlicher). It\r\nwas brought by Rayger, a doctor of medicine, from Italy, where it had been\r\ncarried, to Pressburg, to his brother-in-law Gleichgross, who was a pastor\r\nin that place, amongst whose books it was sold to the library of the\r\nLycaeum in Pressburg. (_See_ Gregory, Proleg. p. 486.)\r\n\r\n87. Trevirensis [xii], fol., contains St. John’s Gospel with a catena,\r\npublished at length by Cordier at Antwerp. It once belonged to the eminent\r\nphilosopher and mathematician, Cardinal Nicolas of Cuza, on the Moselle,\r\nnear Trèves [1401-64: _see_ Cod. 129 Evan., and Cod. 59 Acts]; previously\r\nat the monastery of Petra or of the Fore-runner of Constantinople(237)\r\n(Scholz). Wetstein’s 87 is our 250.\r\n\r\n88. Codex of the Gospels, 4to, on vellum, cited as ancient and correct by\r\nJoachim Camerarius (who collated it) in his Annotations to the New\r\nTestament, 1642. It resembles in text Codd. 63, 72, 80.\r\n\r\n89. Gottingensis Cod. Theol. 53 [1006], fol., ff. 172, _Carp._, _Eus. t._,\r\nκεφ. _t._, κεφ., _Eust._, _lect._, with corrections. Collated by A. G.\r\nGehl in 1729 (?), and by Matthaei (No. 20) in 1786-7.\r\n\r\n90. (Act. 47, Paul. 14.) Cod. Jac. Fabri, a Dominican of Deventer, now in\r\nthe library of the church of the Remonstrants at Amsterdam, 186 [xvi, but\r\ncopied from a manuscript written by Theodore and dated 1293], 4to,\r\n_chart._, 2 vols., κεφ. (Lat.), _lect._, _syn._ The Gospels stand John,\r\nLuke, Matthew, Mark (_see_ p. 70); the Pauline Epistles precede the Acts;\r\nand Jude is written twice, from different copies. This codex (which has\r\nbelonged to Abr. Hinckelmann of Hamburg, and to Wolff) was collated by\r\nWetstein. Faber [1472—living in 1515] had also compared it with another\r\n“very ancient” vellum manuscript of the Gospels presented by Sixtus IV\r\n(1471-84) to Jo. Wessel of Groningen, but which was then at Zvolle. As\r\nmight be expected, this copy much resembles Cod. 74.  See Delitzsch,\r\nHandschr. Funde, ii. pp. 54-57.\r\n\r\n91. Perronianus [x], of which extracts were sent by Montfaucon to Mill,\r\nhad been Cardinal Perron’s [d. 1618], and before him had belonged to “S.\r\nTaurini monasterium Ebroicense” (Evreux). Hort suggests, and Gregory\r\nfavours the suggestion, that this is the same as Evan. 299 (Cod. Par. Reg.\r\n177), which came from Evreux.\r\n\r\n92. Faeschii 1 (Act. 49) [xiv or xv]. 94. Faeschii 2 [xvi or xvii]. The\r\nformer, 10-¼ × 8, ff. 141, κεφ. _t._, τίτλ., _pict._, contains St. Mark\r\nwith Victor’s commentary on vellum, and scholia on the Catholic Epistles,\r\nwith the authors’ names, Didymus, Origen, Cyril, &c., and is referred by\r\nGregory to the tenth century; the latter, 8-½ × 5-½, ff. 172 (22), SS.\r\nMark and Luke, with Victor’s commentary on St. Mark, that of Titus of\r\nBostra on St. Luke, on paper [xv or xvi, Greg.]. Both belonged to Andrew\r\nFaesch, of Basle, and were collated by Wetstein. Dean Burgon found them\r\nboth at Basle (O. ii. 27 and O. ii. 23).\r\n\r\n93. Graevii [1632-1703] of the Gospels, cited by Vossius on the Genealogy,\r\nLuke iii, but not known (Cod. 80? Greg.).\r\n\r\n95. Oxf. Lincoln Coll. II. Gr. 16 [xii or earlier], 10-½ × 8, ff. 110\r\n(20), is Mill’s Wheeler 2(238). It contains SS. Luke and John with\r\ncommentary, _mut._ Luke i. 1-xi. 2; John vii. 2-17; xx. 31-xxi. 10. With\r\nfull scholia neatly written in the margin, κεφ., _Am._ (later), _syn._,\r\n_men._ (Mill, Professor Nicoll).\r\n\r\n96. Bodl. Misc. Gr. 8 (Auct. D. 5. 1) [xv], 5-3/8 × 3-¾, ff. 62 (18),\r\n_chart._, is Walton’s and Mill’s Trit., with many rare readings,\r\ncontaining St. John with a commentary, beautifully written by Jo.\r\nTrithemius, Abbot of Spanheim [d. 1516]. Received from Abraham Scultet by\r\nGeo. Hackwell, 1607 (Walton’s Polyglott, Mill, Griesbach).\r\n\r\n97. Hirsaugiensis [1500, by Nicolas, a monk of Hirschau in Bavaria], 12mo,\r\nff. 71, on vellum, containing St. John, seems but a copy of 96. Collated\r\nby Maius, and the collation given in J. D. Michaelis, Orientalische und\r\nexegetische Bibliothek, ii. p. 243, &c. (Greg., Bengel(239), Maius,\r\nSchulz).\r\n\r\n98. Oxf. Bodl. E. D. Clarke 5 [xii], 8-½ × 6, ff. 222 (25), _pict._, κεφ.\r\n_t._, κεφ., τίτλ., _Am._, _lect._, _subscr._, στίχ., brought by Clarke\r\nfrom the East. It was collated in a few places for Scholz, who substituted\r\nit here for Cod. R (_see_ p. 139) of Griesbach.\r\n\r\n99. Lipsiensis, Bibliothec. Paul, [xvi], 8-¼ × 7-1/8, ff. 22 (22, 23),\r\nMatthaei’s 18, contains Matt. iv. 8-v. 27; vi. 2-xv. 30; Luke i. 1-13;\r\n_Carp._, κεφ. _t._, κεφ., τίτλ., _Am._, _Eus._, _lect._, _syn._ (Matthaei,\r\nGreg.). Wetstein’s 99 is our 155.\r\n\r\n100. Paul. L. B. de Eubeswald [x], 4to, 9-¼ × 7-1/8, ff. 374, κεφ., τίτλ.,\r\n_Am._, _Eus._, _lect._ (_syn._, _men._, ἀναγν. later), vellum, _mut._ John\r\nxxi. 25; _pict._, κεφ. _t._, _Eus. t._, and in a later hand many\r\ncorrections with scholia, _chart._ J. C. Wagenseil used it in Hungary for\r\nJohn viii. 6. Now in the University of Pesth, but in the fifteenth century\r\nbelonging to Bp. Jo. Pannonius. Edited at Pesth in 1860 “cum\r\ninterpretatione Hungaria” by S. Markfi.\r\n\r\n101. Uffenbach. 3 [xvi], 12mo, _chart._, St. John στιχήρης. So near the\r\nBasle (that is, we suppose, Erasmus’) edition, that Bengel scarcely ever\r\ncites it. With two others (Paul. M. and Acts 45) it was lent by Z. C.\r\nUffenbach, Consul of Frankfort-on-the-Main, to Wetstein in 1717, and\r\nafterwards to Bengel. (Gregory would omit it.)\r\n\r\n102. Bibliothecae Medicae, an unknown manuscript with many rare readings,\r\nextracted by Wetstein at Amsterdam for Matt. xxiv-Mark viii. 1, from the\r\nmargin of a copy of Plantin’s N. T. 1591, in the library of J. Le Long.\r\nCanon Westcott is convinced that the manuscript from which these readings\r\nwere derived is none other than Cod. B itself, and Dr. Gregory agrees with\r\nhim. In St. Matthew’s Gospel he finds the two authorities agree seventy\r\ntimes and differ only five times, always in a manner to be easily\r\naccounted for: in St. Mark they agree in eighty-four out of the\r\neighty-five citations, the remaining one (ch. ii. 22) being hardly an\r\nexception. Westcott, New Test., Smith’s “Dictionary of the Bible.” Hort’s\r\nCod. 102 is wscr (Evan. 507), to be described hereafter.\r\n\r\n103. Regius 196 [xi], fol., once Cardinal Mazarin’s, seems the same\r\nmanuscript as that from which Emericus Bigot gave extracts for\r\nCurcellaeus’ N. T. 1658 (Scholz). Burgon supposes some mistake here, as he\r\nfinds Reg. 196 to be a copy of Theophylact’s commentary on SS. Matthew and\r\nMark, written over an older manuscript [viii or ix].  Perhaps the same as\r\n14 or 278 (Greg.).\r\n\r\n104. Hieronymi Vignerii [x], from which also Bigot extracted readings,\r\nwhich Wetstein obtained through J. Drieberg in 1744, and published.\r\nPerhaps 697 (Greg.).\r\n\r\n105. (Act. 48, Paul. 24.) Cod. Ebnerianus, Bodl. Misc. Gr. 136, a\r\nbeautiful copy [xii], 8 × 6-¼, ff. 426 (27), formerly belonging to Jerome\r\nEbner von Eschenbach of Nuremberg. _Pict._, _Carp._, _Eus. t._, κεφ. _t._,\r\nτίτλ., κεφ., _Am._ (not _Eus._), _subscr._, στίχ., the Nicene Creed, all\r\nin gold: with _lect._ throughout and _syn._, _men._ prefixed by Joasaph, a\r\ncalligraphist, A.D. 1391, who also added John viii. 3-11 at the end of\r\nthat Gospel. Facsimile in Horne’s Introduction, and in Tregelles’ Horne,\r\np. 220 (Schoenleben 1738, Rev. H. O. Coxe, by whom the collation was lent\r\nbefore 1845 to the Rev. R. J. F. Thomas, Vicar of Yeovil [d. 1873],\r\ntogether with one of Canon. Graec. 110 of the Acts and Epistles, both of\r\nwhich are mislaid).\r\n\r\n106. Winchelsea [x], with many important readings, often resembling the\r\nHarkleian Syriac: not now in the Earl of Winchelsea’s Library (Jackson\r\ncollated it for Wetstein in 1748).\r\n\r\n107. Bodl. E. D. Clarke 6 [xiv and later], 8-½ × 6-¾, ff. 351, κεφ. _t._,\r\n_pict._, κεφ., τίτλ., containing the Gospels in different hands. (Like 98,\r\n111, 112, _partially_ collated for Scholz.) Griesbach’s 107 is also 201.\r\n\r\n108. Vindobonensis Caesarei, Suppl. Gr. 2, formerly Kollar. 4 [xi], 12-3/8\r\n× 9-¼, ff. 426, 2 vols. With a commentary (Victor’s on St. Mark: Burgon,\r\nLast Twelve Verses, &c., p. 288), _Carp._, _Eus. t._, _prol._, κεφ. _t._,\r\n_pict._, κεφ., τίτλ., _Am._, _Eus._, _subscr._, στίχ. It seems to have\r\nbeen written at Constantinople, and formerly belonged to Parrhasius, then\r\nto the convent of St. John de Carbonaria at Naples (Treschow, Alter,\r\nBirch, Scholz).\r\n\r\n109. Brit. Mus. Addit. 5117 [a.d. 1326], 7-¼ × 5-¾, ff. 225 (24-30), ll.\r\nrubr., _Carp._, _prol._, κεφ. _t._, _Eus. t._, _syn._, _men._, _lect._,\r\n_Am._, τίτλ., _subscr._, στίχ., Mead. 1, then Askew (5115 is Act. 22, and\r\n5116 is Paul. 75, these two in the same hand; different from that employed\r\nin the Gospels).\r\n\r\n110(240).  Brit. Mus. Addit. 19,386 [xiv], 11 × 8, ff. 267 (?), _Carp._,\r\n_Eus. t._ (faded), κεφ. _t._, _prol._, κεφ., τίτλ., _lect._, _syn._, with\r\na dial of the year. Four Gospels with commentary by Theophylact. Purchased\r\nfrom Constantine Simonides in 1853. (Greg. 1260.)\r\n\r\n111(241). Bodl. Clarke 7 [xii], 8-¼ × 6, ff. 181 (31), κεφ. _t._ (_mut._\r\nMatt.), κεφ., τίτλ., _Am._, _vers._, _subscr._, στίχ. _Mut._ John xvi.\r\n27-xvii. 15; xx. 25-end, and\r\n\r\n112(242). Bodl. Clarke 10 [xi], 5-¼ × 4-¼, ff. 167 (33), _Carp._, _Eus.\r\nt._, _prol._, _pict._, _syn._, _men._, κεφ. _t._, κεφ., τίτλ., _lect._,\r\nwith commencement and large letters in gold, having both _Am._ and _Eus._,\r\nin Matt. i-Mark ii, in the same line (a very rare arrangement; _see_ Codd.\r\n192, 198, 212, and Wake 21 _below_), a very beautiful copy. These two,\r\nvery partially collated for Scholz, were substituted by him and\r\nTischensdorf for collations whose history is not a little curious.\r\n\r\n113. Brit. Mus. Harleian. 1810 [xi], 8 × 7-¼, ff. 270 (26), _prol._,\r\n_syn._ (later), _Carp._, _Eus. t._, κεφ. _t._, _pict._, κεφ., τίτλ.,\r\n_Am._, _Eus._, _lect._ (Griesbach, Bloomfield). Apparently this is\r\nBentley’s θ “membr. 4to 600 annorum,” collated by him in the margin of\r\nTrin. Coll. B. xvii. 5 (_see_ Cod. 51). Its readings are of more than\r\nusual interest, as are those of the next.\r\n\r\n114. Brit. Mus.

Dean Burgon has\r\ndescribed his own researches at Florence in the _Guardian_ for August 20\r\nand 27, 1873, from which I have thankfully corrected the statements made\r\nin my first edition respecting all the manuscripts there. They have been\r\nexamined since then more leisurely by Dr. Gregory, from whose careful\r\naccount some particulars have been added in this edition (_see_ Greg.,\r\nProlegomena (ii), pp. 505-509).\r\n\r\n182.

This mode\r\nof reckoning is very rare (_see_ p. 42, note 2), and tempted Scholz to\r\nread ϛυιή of the Greek era, i.e. A.D. 910.\r\n\r\n184. Flor.

The date of the year is lost, but the month (May)\r\nand indiction (8) remain. Κεφ. _t._, κεφ., τίτλ., _Am._, _Eus._, _syn._,\r\n_men._\r\n\r\n196. Flor.

Ecc.” Here again _Am._ and\r\n_Eus._ are in the same line (_see_ Cod. 112): the ἀναγνώσματα also are\r\nnumbered.\r\n\r\nCodd. 199-203 were inspected, rather than collated, by Birch at Florence\r\nbefore 1788; the first two in the Benedictine library of St. Maria; the\r\nothers in that of St. Mark, belonging to the Dominican Friars. Scholz\r\ncould not find any of them, but 201 is Wetstein’s 107, Scrivener’s m; 202\r\nis now in the British Museum, Addit. 14,774. The other two Burgon found in\r\nthe Laurentian Library, whither they came at the suppression of\r\nmonasteries in 1810. They were examined afterwards by Gregory.\r\n\r\n199. Flor. Laur. Conv. Sopp. 160, formerly Badia 99 or S.

The\r\nστίχοι are numbered and, besides _Am._, _Eus._, there exists in parts a\r\nHarmony at the foot of the pages, such as is described in p. 58, note 2.\r\n\r\n200. Flor. Laur. Conv. Sopp. 159, formerly Badia 69 or S. Mariae 66 [x],\r\n8-¾ × 6-7/8, ff. 229 (25), _pict._, _Carp._, _Eus. t._, κεφ. _t._, _Am._,\r\nall in gold: _Eus._ in red, κεφ., τίτλ., with fragments of Gregory of\r\nNyssa against the Arians (_syn._ and _men._ xiv). There are many scholia\r\nin vermilion scattered throughout the book. Codd. 199, 200 were presented\r\nto St. Maria’s by Antonia Corbinelli [d. 1423]: the latter from St.\r\nJustina’s, another Benedictine house.\r\n\r\n*201. (Act. 91, Paul. 104, Apoc. 94.) Lond. Brit. Mus. Addit. 11,837,\r\nformerly Praedicator. S. Marci 701 [Oct. 7, 1357, Ind. 11], 13-½ × 11, ff.\r\n492 (22), is mscr. in the Gospels, pscr. in Act., Paul., and bscr. in\r\nApoc. This splendid copy was purchased for the British Museum from the\r\nheirs of Dr. Samuel Butler, Bishop of Lichfield. It contains the whole New\r\nTestament; was first cited by Wetstein (107) from notices by Jo. Lamy, in\r\nhis “de Eruditione Apostolorum,” Florence, 1738; glanced at by Birch, and\r\nstated by Scholz (N. T. vol. ii. pp. xii, xxviii) to have been cursorily\r\ncollated by himself: how that is possible can hardly be understood, as he\r\nelsewhere professes his ignorance whither the manuscript had gone (N. T.\r\nvol. i. p. lxxii). Scrivener collated the whole volume. There are many\r\nchanges by a later hand, also _syn._, κεφ. _t._, κεφ., τίτλ., _Am._, some\r\n_Eus._, _lect._, _prol._, ἀναγν., _subscr._, στίχ., _vers._, and some\r\nforeign matter.\r\n\r\n202. Brit. Mus. Addit. 14,774, formerly Praed. S. Marci 705 [xii], 10 × 8,\r\nff. 278 (21), κεφ. _t._ (in red and gold), _orn._, κεφ., τίτλ., _Am._,\r\n_Eus._ (the last often omitted), _lect._, _subscr._, στίχ., _men._, _syn._\r\nThis splendid copy cost the Museum £84 (Bloomfield).\r\n\r\n203. Flor. Bibl. Nat. Convent. i. 10, 7, formerly Praed. S. Marci 707\r\n[xv], 8-5/8 × 5-¾, _chart._, is really in modern Greek. Birch cites it for\r\nJohn vii. 53, but it ought to be expunged from the list.\r\n\r\n204. (Act. 92, Paul. 105.) [xi or xiii], Bologna, Bibl. Univ. 2775,\r\nformerly Bononiensis Canonicor. Regular. St. Salvador 640. After the\r\nsuppression of the house in 1867, it was moved to its present place. 7-¾ ×\r\n5-3/8, ff. 443 (25). _Syn._, κεφ., ἀναγνώσματα numbered (without _Am._,\r\n_Carp._), _lect._, _pict._ (Birch, Scholz, corrected by Burgon). Also\r\nτίτλ., _men._, _subscr._, στίχ.\r\n\r\nCodd. 205-215, 217 in the Ducal palace at Venice, were slightly examined\r\nby Birch in 1783, carefully by Burgon in 1872, and by Gregory in 1886.\r\n\r\n205. (Act. 93, Paul. 106, Apoc. 88.) Venice, Mark 5 [xv], large fol., 15-½\r\n× 11, ff. 441 (55, 56), _prol._ (Cath., Paul.), κεφ. _t._, κεφ. (Gr. and\r\nLat.), τίτλ., _subscr._, contains both Testaments, with many peculiar\r\nreadings. It was written for Cardinal Bessarion (apparently by John Rhosen\r\nhis librarian), the donor of all these books. This is Dean Holmes’ No. 68\r\nin the Septuagint, and contains a note in the Cardinal’s hand: τόπος μκ. Ἡ\r\nθεία γραφὴ παλαιά τε καὶ νέα πᾶσα; κτῆμα Βησσαρίωνος Καρδηνάλεως Ἐπισκόπου\r\nΟαβινων τοῦ (sic) καὶ Νικαίας. By τόπος μκ Holmes understands the class\r\nmark of the volume in Bessarion’s Library.  W. F. Rinck considers it in\r\nthe _Gospels_ a copy of Cod. 209 (“Lucubratio Critica in Act. Apost. Epp.\r\nC. et P.,” Basileae, 1830). Burgon, who fully admits their wonderful\r\nsimilarity in respect to the text, judges that Cod. 205, which is much\r\nmore modern than Cod. 209, was transcribed from the same _uncial_\r\narchetype.\r\n\r\n206. (Act. 94, Paul. 107, Apoc. 101.) Ven. Mark 6 [xv or xvi], 15 ×\r\n10-5/8, ff. 431, like Codd. 69 and 233, is partly on parchment, partly on\r\npaper. It contains both Testaments, but is not numbered for the\r\nApocalypse. A mere duplicate of Cod. 205, as Holmes saw clearly: it is his\r\nNo. 122.\r\n\r\n207. Ven. Mark 8 [xi or xii], 10-7/8 × 8-3/8, ff. 267 (22), 2 cols.,\r\n_Carp._, _prol._, _pict._, κεφ. _t._, τίτλ., κεφ., _Am._ (not _Eus._) in\r\ngold, _syn._, _men._, _mut._ in Matt. i. 1-13; Mark i. 1-11, for the sake\r\nof the gorgeous illuminations. Written in two columns. Once owned by A. F.\r\nR.\r\n\r\n208. Ven. Mark 9 [xi or xii], 7-1/8 × 5-¾, ff. 239 (23), _Carp._, _Eus.\r\nt._, κεφ. _t._, κεφ., τίτλ., _Am._, _Eus._, of some value.\r\n\r\n209. (Act. 95, Paul. 108, Apoc. 46.) Ven. Mark 10 [xi, xiv Greg.], 7-¾ ×\r\n4-¾, ff. 411 (27), of the whole New Testament, once Bessarion’s, who had\r\nit with him at the Council of Florence, 1439. There are numerous minute\r\nmarginal notes in vermilion, obviously _primâ manu_. In its delicate style\r\nof writing this copy greatly resembles Cod. 1 (facsimile No. 23). Κεφ.\r\n_t._, τίτλ., κεφ., _Am._ (not _Eus._), also the modern chapters in the\r\nmargin. _Prol._ to Epistles, _lect._, but not much in the Gospels, before\r\neach of which stands a blank leaf, as if for _pict._ A good collation of\r\nCodd. 205 and 209 is needed; Birch did little, Engelbreth gave him some\r\nreadings, and Fleck has published part of a collation by Heimbach. Rinck\r\ncollated Apoc. i-iii. In the Gospels they are very like Codd. B, 1. The\r\nApocalypse is in a later hand, somewhat resembling that of Cod. 205, and\r\nhas _prol._ For the unusual order of the books, _see_ above, p. 72.\r\n\r\n210. Ven. Mark 27 [xi or xii], a noble fol., 14 × 11-7/8, ff. 372, with a\r\ncatena (Victor’s commentary on St. Mark). _Mut._ Matt. i. 1-ii. 18, from\r\nthe same cause as in Cod. 207. Rich blue and gold illuminations, and\r\npictures of SS. Mark and Luke. Τίτλ., κεφ., _pict._\r\n\r\n211. Ven. Mark 539 [xii], fol., 11-½ × 9-½, ff. 280 (29-26), 2 cols.,\r\n_mut._ Luke i. 1-ii. 32; John i. 1-iv. 2, with an Arabic version in the\r\nright-hand column of each page. Κεφ. t., Am., Eus. (irregularly inserted),\r\n_lect._, _syn._, _men._, _subscr._, ῥήμ., στίχ.\r\n\r\nBurgon cites Zanetti, Graeca D. Marc. Bibl. Codd. MSS., Venet. 1740, p.\r\n291, for the enumeration of the five Patriarchates (_see_ above, p. 67),\r\nand other curious matter appended to St. John. The heading of the second\r\nGospel is εὐαγγέλιον ἐκ τοῦ κατὰ Μάρκον.\r\n\r\n212. Ven. Mark 540 [xi or xii], 6-7/8 × 5, ff. 273 (23), the first page in\r\ngold, with _pict._ and most elaborate illuminations. Much _mut._, twenty\r\nleaves being supplied in a modern hand. _Carp._, _Eus. t._, κεφ., _vers._,\r\nτίτλ., _lect._, _Am._ with _Eus._ in a line with them (_see_ Cod. 112), a\r\nlittle later, carried only to the end of St. Mark.\r\n\r\n213. Ven. Mark 542 [xi], 8vo, 8-1/8 × 6-¼, ff. 356 (18), _mut._ John\r\nxviii. 40-xxi. 25. _Eus. t._, τίτλ., κεφ. (_Am._, _Eus._ most irregularly\r\ninserted), few ἀρχαί and τέλη, ἀναγν., heroic verses as colophons to the\r\nGospels. Large full stops are found in impossible places.\r\n\r\n214. Ven. Mark 543 [xiv], 8vo, 9-¾ × 6-¼, ff. 227 (27), _chart._,\r\n_argent._, _prol._, κεφ. _t._ with _harm._, κεφ., _Am._ (not _Eus._),\r\nἀναγν., _lect._, _syn._, _men._, _subscr._, _vers._\r\n\r\n215. Ven. Mark 544 [xi], fol., 12-¾ × 9-½, ff. 271 (24), _Carp._, _Eus.\r\nt._, κεφ. _t._ with _harm._, τίτλ., κεφ., _Am._, _Eus._, _lect._, _syn._,\r\n_pict._ (later). This copy is a duplicate of Codd. 20, 300, as well in its\r\ntext as in the subscriptions and commentary, being without any of the\r\nlater corrections seen in Cod. 20. The commentary on St. John is\r\nChrysostom’s, those on the other Gospels the same as in Cod. 300 (Burgon).\r\n\r\n216. Codex Canonici, brought by him from Corcyra, written in a small\r\ncharacter [no date assigned], never was at St. Mark’s, as Scholz alleges:\r\nGriesbach inserted it in his list through a misunderstanding of Birch’s\r\nmeaning. It is probably one of those now at Oxford, to be described\r\nhereafter (_see_ Codd. 489, 490).\r\n\r\n217. Ven. Mark, Gr. i. 3, given in 1478 by Peter de Montagnana to the\r\nmonastery of St. John in Viridario, at Padua (viii. A.) [xii or xiii],\r\n8-1/8 × 6-1/8, ff. 306 (21), in fine condition. _Carp._, _Eus. t._, κεφ.\r\n_t._, τίτλ., κεφ., _Am._ (not _Eus._), full _syn._, few _lect._, _prol._,\r\n_vers._ Codd. 218-225 are in the Imperial Library at Vienna. Alter and\r\nBirch collated them about the same time, the latter but cursorily, and\r\nGregory examined them in 1887.\r\n\r\n*218. (Act. 65, Paul. 57, Apoc. 33.) Vindobon. Caesar, Nessel. 23,\r\nformerly 1 [xiii], fol., 12-½ × 8-¾, ff. 623 (49, 50), 2 cols., κεφ. _t._,\r\nκεφ., τίτλ., _Am._, _subscr._, _Euthal._ in Acts, Cath., Paul., contains\r\nboth Testaments. _Mut._ Apoc. xiii. 5-xiv. 8; xv. 7-xvii. 2; xviii.\r\n10-xix. 15; ending at xx. 7 λυθήσεται. This important copy, containing\r\nmany peculiar readings, was described by Treschow, and comprises the text\r\nof Alter’s inconvenient, though fairly accurate N. T. 1786-7, to be\r\ndescribed in Vol. II. Like Cod. 123 it was brought from Constantinople by\r\nDe Busbeck.\r\n\r\n219. Vind. Caes.

Kelly, who obligingly communicated it to me, a complete\r\ncatalogue of the four copies of the Greek Bible, and of nineteen of the\r\nNew Testament “neither more or less,” then at the Escurial, with their\r\npresent class-marks. I do not recognize, either in his list or in that\r\nsubjoined, the “Codex Aureus containing the Four Gospels in letters of\r\ngold, a work of the early part of the eleventh century,” spoken of in the\r\n_Globe_ newspaper of Oct. 3, 1872, on occasion of the fire at the Escurial\r\non Oct. 2, which however did not touch the manuscripts. Perhaps that Codex\r\nis in Latin, unless it be Evst. 40. _See_ also Emmanuel Miller, Cat. des\r\nMSS. Gr. de la Bibl. de l’Escurial, Paris, A.D. 1848.\r\n\r\n226. (Act. 108, Paul. 228.) Cod.

Fairly collated.\r\n\r\n227. Escurial. χ. iii. 15 [xiii], 4to, ff. 158, _prol._, κεφ. _t._, _Am._,\r\n_pict._ A later hand, which dates from 1308, has been very busy in making\r\ncorrections.\r\n\r\n228. (Act. 109, Paul. 229.) Escurial. χ. iv. 12 [xiv, Montana xvi], 8vo,\r\nff. ?, _chart._ Once belonged to Nicolas Nathanael of Crete, then to\r\nAndreas Damarius of Epidaurus, a calligrapher. _Eus. t._, _syn._(247)\r\n\r\n229. Escurial. χ. iv. 21 [dated 1140], 8vo, ff. 296, written by Basil\r\nArgyropolus, a notary. _Mut._ Mark xvi. 15-20; John i. 1-11. _Pict._,\r\n_lect._; the latter by a hand of about the fourteenth century, which\r\nretraced much of the discoloured ink, and corrected in the margin (since\r\nmutilated by the binder) very many important readings of the first hand,\r\nwhich often resemble those of ADK. i. 72. This copy must be mislaid, as it\r\nis not in Montana’s list.\r\n\r\n230. Escurial. φ (Montana ψ).(248) iii. 5 [dated Oct. 29, 1013, with the\r\nwrong Indiction, 11 for 12: Montana’s date is 1014, and the error is\r\nprobably not his: _see_ p. 42, note 2], 4to, ff. 218, written by Luke a\r\nmonk and priest, with double _syn._(249), _Carp._, κεφ. _t._, _subscr._,\r\nῥήμ, στίχ.: _see_ p. 67, note. An interesting copy, deemed by Moldenhawer\r\nworthy of closer examination.\r\n\r\n231. Escurial. φ (Montana ψ). iii. 6 [xii], 4to, ff. 181, _lect._, _Eus.\r\nt._, torn, κεφ. _t._, a picture “quae Marcum mentitur,” _subscr._, στίχ.,\r\n_syn._, _men._ There are some marginal glosses by a later hand (which\r\nobelizes John vii. 53 _seq._), and a Latin version above parts of St.\r\nMatthew.\r\n\r\n232. Escurial. φ (Montana ψ). iii. 7 [xiii: dated 1292, Montana], 4to, ff.\r\n288, very elegant but otherwise a poor copy. Double _syn._, τίτλοι in the\r\nmargin of SS. Matthew and Luke, but elsewhere kept apart.\r\n\r\n233. Escurial. Υ. ii. 8 [xi ?, Montana xiii], ff. 279, like Codd. 69 and\r\n206, is partly of parchment, partly paper, in bad condition, and once\r\nbelonged to Matthew Dandolo, a Venetian noble. It has a catena, and by\r\nreason of ligatures, &c. (_see_ p. 43), is hard to read. _prol._, κεφ.\r\n_t._, _Eus. t._ (apart), _vers._, ῥήμ., στίχ.\r\n\r\n234. (Act. 57, Paul. 72.) Cod.

Bought at Athens in 1889. Collated by W. C.\r\nBraithwaite.\r\n\r\nCodd. 237-259 are nearly all Moscow manuscripts, and were thoroughly\r\ncollated by C. F. Matthaei, for his N. T., to be described in Vol. II.\r\nThese Russian codices were for the most part brought from the twenty-two\r\nmonasteries of Mount Athos by the monk Arsenius, on the suggestion of the\r\nPatriarch Nico, in the reign of Michael, son of Alexius (1645-76), and\r\nplaced in the Library of the Holy Synod, at Moscow.\r\n\r\n*237.

Syn. 48 (Mt. e) [xi], fol., ff. 355, _Eus. t._ (_mut._), κεφ.\r\n_t._, _pict._, with a catena and scholia; contains only SS. Matthew and\r\nMark, but is of good quality. This copy formed the basis of Matthaei’s\r\nedition of Victor’s commentary on St. Mark, 1775 (Burgon).\r\n\r\n*239. Mosc. Syn. 47 (Mt. g) [xi], fol., ff. 277, _Eus. t._, κεφ. _t._\r\n(Luke, John), contains Mark xvi. 2-8; Luke; John to xxi. 23, with scholia.\r\n\r\n*240. Mosc.

Mosc. Syn. 94 (Mt. s) [xi], fol., ff. 809 (more likely 309 as\r\nGreg.), from Παντοκράτωρ monastery (as Cod. 74). Contains St. John with a\r\ncatena.\r\n\r\n*250. Mosc. Syn. in a box (Mt. v) [xiii], small 8vo, ff. 225, _Carp._,\r\n_Eus. t._, κεφ. _t._, _Am._, _Eus._, _syn._, is the cursive portion of Cod\r\nV (_see_ p. 144, and note), John vii. 39-xxi. 25.

Mosc. of Nicephorus Archbishop of Cherson “et Slabinii” (Slaviansk\r\n?)(251), formerly belonged to the monastery of St. Michael at Jerusalem\r\n(Mt. 10) [xi], fol., ff. 248, _prol._, κεφ. _t._, _Am._, _Eus._, with\r\nscholia, Victor’s commentary on St. Mark, and rare readings, much\r\nresembling those of Cod. 259.\r\n\r\n*254. Dresd. A. 100 (Matthaei 11) (Tregelles) [xi], 11-5/8 × 9-1/8, ff.\r\n247 (24), κεφ. _t._, κεφ., _Am._, _Eus._, _pict._, from the monastery of\r\nSt. Athanasius. Contains SS.

This is one of\r\nMatthaei’s best manuscripts. His other twenty-two copies contain portions\r\nof Chrysostom, and therefore come under the head of Patristic Quotations.\r\n\r\nCodd. 260-469 were added to the list by Scholz: the very few he professes\r\nto have collated thoroughly will be distinguished by an asterisk.\r\n\r\n260. Paris National.

The leaves are misplaced in binding, as are those of Cod. 272.\r\nAt the foot of every page is a harmony like those in Codd. E, Wd. _See_ p.\r\n58, note 2 (Burgon).\r\n\r\nOf these copies, 265-270, Burgon states that the grand 4to Cod. 265 seems\r\nto contain an important text, 270 a peculiar text, though less beautiful\r\nexternally than 266, 267, 269. Cod. 268 in double columns has _Eus. t._\r\nvery superb, but _pict._ of Evangelists only sketched in ink. Cod. 269,\r\nonce belonging to Henry IV (in which the last leaf of St. Luke is\r\nmissing), is in its ancient binding, and is full of very uncommon\r\nrepresentations of Gospel incidents.\r\n\r\n265.

Dean Burgon had a photograph of this manuscript,\r\nwhich he regarded as a specimen of the transition period between uncial\r\nand cursive writing. The subscription, resembling that of Cod.

Dr. Gregory has traced this MS. to\r\nNo. 54 in the library of the Jesuit College at Clermont, then to Meerman,\r\nthen to Payne a London bookseller, who bought it in 1824. It is not known\r\nnow.

His list of Oriental manuscripts\r\n(Evann. 450-469), as it is given in the first volume of his Greek\r\nTestament (Proleg. pp. xcvi-xcvii)(255), has been withdrawn from the\r\ncatalogue of cursive copies of the Gospels, in deference to the wish of\r\nthe Dean of Chichester (Letter iii addressed to myself in the _Guardian_\r\nnewspaper, July 5, 1882). It must be confessed indeed that Scholz’s\r\naccount of what he had seen in the East about 1823 cannot be easily\r\nreconciled with the description of the Rev. H. O. Coxe of the Bodleian\r\nLibrary thirty-five years later (“Report to Her Majesty’s Government of\r\nthe Greek Manuscripts yet remaining in the Libraries of the Levant,\r\n1858”); that most of the books which Scholz catalogued at St. Saba on the\r\nDead Sea were removed before 1875, as Mr. F. W. Pennefather informs us, to\r\nthe Great Greek Convent of the Cross at Jerusalem; and that at least four\r\nof them were brought to Parham in Sussex from St. Saba in 1834 by the late\r\nLord de la Zouche. Instead of Scholz’s seven (450-6), Coxe saw fourteen\r\ncopies of the Gospels at Jerusalem; twenty of the Gospels (besides a noble\r\npalimpsest of the Orestes and Phoenissae) at St. Saba after the four had\r\nbeen subtracted, instead of Scholz’s ten (457-466); at Patmos five instead\r\nof Scholz’s three (467-469). In spite of one’s respect for the memory of\r\nthat zealous and worthy labourer, M. A. Scholz, with whom I had a personal\r\nconference regarding our common studies in 1845, I cannot help acquiescing\r\nin Dean Burgon’s decision, though not, perhaps, without some natural\r\nreluctance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII. CURSIVE MANUSCRIPTS OF THE GOSPELS. PART II.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have already intimated that Tischendorf has chosen to make no addition\r\nto the numerical list of cursive manuscripts furnished by Scholz,\r\npreferring to indicate the fresh materials which have since come to light\r\nby another notation, derived from the names of the collators or the places\r\nwhere they are deposited. As this plan has proved in practice very\r\ninconvenient, it is no wonder that Dean Burgon, after casting away\r\nScholz’s numbers from 450 to 469, on account of their evident inaccuracy,\r\nwhich has since then received definite proof, should have assigned\r\nnumerals to the cursives unknown to Scholz from 450 to 737, still\r\nexcluding, as far as was then possible, those whose location or character\r\nwas uncertain. Burgon’s method, as laid down in his Letters in the\r\n_Guardian_ for July 5, 12, 19, 26, 1882, having the priority of\r\npublication, and being arranged with regard to the places where the\r\nmanuscripts are deposited rather than to their actual collators, may as\r\nwell be adopted as any other that might be made. The only important point\r\nto be secured is that all scholars should employ the SAME NUMBERS when\r\nspeaking of the SAME MANUSCRIPTS.\r\n\r\nIt is greatly to be regretted that Dr. C. R. Gregory, even upon advice\r\ntendered by other critics, if such was the case, should have neglected the\r\nimportant principle laid down in the preceding sentence, and in Part II of\r\nhis very valuable Prolegomena to Tischendorf’s eighth edition, published\r\nseven years after the third edition of this work, should have helped to\r\nmake confusion worse confounded in this large and increasing field. But it\r\nis not my object to assail one who has done this study very great service,\r\nbut only to point out an inconvenience which I shall endeavour to minimize\r\nas far as I can. It is clear that Dr. Scrivener’s order, being the first\r\nout, and having been followed since then in quotations in books, and\r\nnotably by the late learned Abbé Martin, cannot be allowed to drop. I have\r\ntherefore followed it in the succeeding pages. But it has been my object\r\nto bring together the two lists as soon as possible after the close of Dr.\r\nScrivener’s, and the end of the supplementary lists of Dean Burgon and the\r\nAbbé Martin, and to follow, as far as the case will admit, the lead of Dr.\r\nGregory, where he has every right to prescribe the series of numbers.\r\nUnfortunately, this course is not always open, because when the time has\r\narrived it is found that some MSS. have been already forestalled, and\r\nothers are in arrear.\r\n\r\nIt should be added, that the number of the MSS. as standing in Dr.\r\nGregory’s list, where it varies from the present, is given at the end of\r\nthe account of each manuscript; and reversely a table is added at the end\r\nof this volume of the varying numbers in this list which answer to the\r\nnumbers in Dr. Gregory’s list.\r\n\r\nWe begin with the following twenty Italian manuscripts, added to our\r\nprevious list of cursive copies of the Gospels by Burgon in Letters\r\naddressed to Dr. Scrivener and inserted in the _Guardian_ of Jan. 29 and\r\nFeb. 5, 1873.\r\n\r\n450.

Marc. 495 [xv], 16 × 11-¼, _chart._, ff. 437 (42), κεφ. _t._,\r\nκεφ., τίτλ., _Am._, _lect._, _vers._, described by Zanetti, p. 259, with a\r\ncommentary (Victor’s on St. Mark). (Greg. 599.)\r\n\r\nWe do not include Ven. Marc. i. 61, which is a mere catena on Matt. i-ix,\r\nor an unnumbered catena of St. Luke in the same Library, or Ven. M. 1, an\r\nuncial copy of the Old Testament [ix ?], at the end of which are found\r\n_Carp._, _Eus. t._ of unique fullness, as if the Gospels were to follow.\r\n\r\n468. Ven.

Poictiers [xvi], small folio,\r\n_chart._, of the whole New Testament, as described to Burgon by M.\r\nDartige, the librarian there. Two librarians named Cavou successfully\r\nrobbed the library, and probably sold miniatures and pictures. (H. C.\r\nHoskier.) G. Haenel (Catal. Librorum MSS. Lips. 1830) names this and\r\nanother of the whole N. T. at Arras [xv], 8vo, but of the latter the\r\nlibrarian, M. Wicquot, knows nothing.\r\n\r\nEdward de Muralt, in his N. T. “ad fidem codicis principis Vaticani,” 1848\r\n(p. 111), inserts a collation of eleven manuscripts (five of the Gospels,\r\none Psalter with hymns, five Lectionaries), chiefly at St. Petersburg. He\r\nalso describes them in his Preface (pp. lv-lvii), and in the Catalogue of\r\nGreek Manuscripts in the Imperial Library there.

St. Mark of this MS. was edited by J. Belsheim with facsimile\r\nin 1885 (Jacob Dybwad, Christiania). Highly valued by some critics. (Greg.\r\n565.)\r\n\r\n474. 4pe, Petrop. 98.

This precious\r\ntreasure was the property of Porphyry Uspensky, Bp. of Kiow, but is now at\r\nSt. Petersburg. (_See_ Greg. 461.)\r\n\r\nThe five following are in the Bodleian Library, and for the most part\r\nuncollated:—\r\n\r\n482. Oxf. Bodl.

(Greg.\r\n706.)\r\n\r\nTo this list we must add the five following copies from the collection of\r\nthe Abbot M. Aloy. Canonici, purchased at Venice in 1817 for the Bodleian\r\nLibrary by Dr. Bandinel, who secured 2045 out of the total number of 3550\r\nmanuscripts.\r\n\r\n487. Oxf. Bodl. Canon. Gr. 33.

The Acts,\r\nCatholic and Pauline Epistles (Œcumenius’ _prol._, κεφ., scholia) follow\r\nthem, and last of all comes the Apocalypse. _Mut._ Luke xvi. 26-30; xvii.\r\n5-8; xxiv. 22-24; John i. 1-vii. 39; viii. 31-ix. 11; x. 10-xi. 54; xii.\r\n36-xiii. 27; Acts i. 1-vii. 49; x. 19-xiv. 10; xv. 15-xvi. 11; xviii.\r\n1-xxi. 25; xxiii. 18-James iii. 17; 1 Cor. xii. 11-xv. 12; xvi. 13-15; 2\r\nCor. xiii. 4, 5; Gal. v. 16-vi. 18 (partly); 2 Tim. iii. 10, 11; Tit. iii.\r\n5-7; the illuminations also being often wantonly cut out.

One leaf (John xix. 13-29), and another containing John\r\nxxi. 24, 25, are in duplicate at the beginning, _primâ manu_. (Greg. 509.)\r\nThis copy (as Wake remarks) is in the same style, but less free than:—\r\n\r\n496. Oxf. Ch. Ch.

This remarkable copy begins with the ὑπόθεσις to 2\r\nPeter, the second leaf contains Acts xvii. 24-xviii. 13 misplaced, then\r\nfollow the five later Catholic Epistles (_mut._ 1 John iii. 19-iv. 9) with\r\nὑποθέσις: then the Apocalypse on the same page as Jude ends, and the\r\nὑπόθέσις to the Romans on the same page as the Apocalypse ends, and then\r\nthe Pauline Epistles (_mut._ Heb. vii. 26-ix. 28). All the Epistles have\r\n_prol._, κεφ. _t._, and Œcumenius’ smaller (not the Euthalian) κεφ., with\r\nmuch _lect. primâ manu_, and _syn._ later.

There is no heading to St. Luke’s Gospel, but\r\na blank space is left, so that perhaps the MS. was never finished. Κεφ.\r\n_t._, κεφ., τίτλ., _Am._, _Eus._ (partially).

I. 7, contains the Four Gospels and the Acts,\r\nbreaking off at ch. xxvi. 24 μαίνῃ παῦλε; the writing being unusually full\r\nof abbreviations, and the margin gradually contracting, as if vellum was\r\nbecoming scarce. The last five pages are in another, though contemporary\r\nhand. Seven pages containing Gregory Nazianzen’s heroic verses on the\r\nLord’s genealogy, and others on His miracles and parables, partly in red,\r\nprecede κεφ. _t._ to St. Matthew; other such verses of Gregory precede SS.\r\nMark and Luke, and follow St. John, and κεφ. _t._ stand before SS.

Dated, perhaps by the first hand, A.D.\r\n1323. (Greg. 540, 541.)\r\n\r\n*555. B.-C. III. 4 [xiii], 7 × 5, ff. 264 (24), _prol._, κεφ. _t._, τίτλ.,\r\nΚεφ., _Am._, _Eus._, _lect._, _pict._ of the four Evangelists, _syn._\r\nincomplete at the end. Some leaves are misplaced in St. Matthew. _Mut._\r\nJohn xix. 25-xxi. 2. (Greg. 542.)\r\n\r\n*556. B.-C.

This copy has John vii. 53-viii. 11 after Luke\r\nxxi. 38, like Ferrar’s four, with which its text much agrees, and the\r\ntitles to SS. Matthew and Mark only run εὐαγγέλιον ἐκ τοῦ κατὰ M ...\r\n(Greg. 543.)\r\n\r\n*557. B.-C. III. 9 [xiii], 5-½ × 3-½, ff. 256 (22), κεφ. _t._ to the last\r\nthree Gospels, τίτλ., κεφ., _Am._ (not _Eus._), _pict._ of SS. Matthew,\r\nMark, and John. This copy is remarkably free from _lect._ Neatly written,\r\nbut four considerable passages in St. Luke are omitted, the text running\r\non _uno tenore_. (Greg. 544.)\r\n\r\n*558. B.-C. III. 10 [dated A.D. 1430], 8 × 5-½, ff. 374 (+ 16 + 34) (16),\r\n_chart._, _pict._ of the four Evangelists, of the Saviour, and of the\r\nVirgin and Child. _Carp._, _Eus. t._, κεφ. _t._, _prol._, _Am._, _Eus._,\r\n_lect._, _vers._ The leaves are much misplaced in binding. (Greg. 545.)\r\n\r\n*559. B.-C. III. 41 [xii or xiii], 6-½ × 4-½, ff. 275 (22). _Mut._ at\r\nbeginning and end (John xviii. 30-end) and about Matt. xii. 16. Κεφ. _t._,\r\nτίτλ., _pict._, in a bad condition. (Greg. 546.)\r\n\r\nThe next two were purchased in 1876 of Quaritch for £120 and £50\r\nrespectively by Mr. Jonathan Peckover, and now belong to Miss Algerina\r\nPeckover, of Bank House, Wisbech. Burgon examined them, and J. R. Harris\r\nsince then.\r\n\r\n560. (Act. 222, Paul. 278.) Algerina Peckover (1) [xi], small 4to, ff. 239\r\n(33), contains the Gospels, Acts, and Epistles in their usual Greek order,\r\n“an exquisite specimen, in a somewhat minute character.” It begins with a\r\npicture of St. Matthew, the lost preliminary matter being prefixed\r\n_chart._ by a later hand. _Pict._, τίτλ., κεφ., _Am._, _Eus._, _lect._\r\n(ἀρχ. and τέλ.), _subscr._, στίχ., _vers._, _syn._, _men._ On the last\r\nleaf is written in uncial letters: ὡς ἡδὺς τοῖς πλέουσιν ὁ εὔδιος λιμήν; |\r\nοὕτως καὶ τοῖς γράφουσιν ὁ ἔσχατος στίχος. ἰωαννικίου μοναχοῦ.  (Greg.\r\n712.)\r\n\r\n561.  Algerina Peckover (2), [xi or a little later], 7-3/8 × 5-¾, ff. 356\r\n(16), with 17 (3 + 14) uncial palimpsest leaves at the beginning and end,\r\ncontaining Lessons from the Epistles to be described hereafter (Apost.\r\n43). _Carp._, _prol._ (later), κεφ. _t._, _pict._, κεφ., τίτλ., _Am._,\r\n_Eus._, _lect._ (ἀρχ. and τέλ.), _subscr._, _syn._, _men._ (later). _Mut._\r\nMatt. xxvii. 43, 44; John vii. 53-viii. 11; x. 27-xi. 14 (2 ff.); xi.\r\n29-42 (1 f.). Marg. notes, Matt. v. 14; xvi. 15. One of the Ferrar group.\r\n_See_ J. R. Harris, Codex Algerina Peckover (Journal of Exegetical\r\nSociety). (Greg. 713.)\r\n\r\n*562. Oxf. Bodl. MS. Bibl. Gr. L. 1. Mendham [xiv], 9-½ × 7, ff. 270 [sic]\r\n(20), κεφ. _t._, κεφ., τίτλ., _lect._, _subscr._, στίχ., ἀναγν., _vers._,\r\n_syn._, _men._ Bohn became possessed of it, whether from Meerman or not is\r\nnot known, and sold it to the Rev. Theodore Williams, Vicar of Hendon, for\r\n£120. The Rev. Joseph Mendham bought it of Payne for £70 in 1827. It was\r\ngiven by Mr. Mendham’s widow to Dean Burgon for his life, afterwards to go\r\nto the Bodleian Library, where the Rev. W. F. Rose brought it upon the\r\nDean’s death. It is dated on the last leaf by a later hand, A.D. 1322. It\r\nis evenly written in pale brown ink with a reed-pen. The last twenty\r\nleaves contain the Gospels for Maundy Thursday, for Good Friday, and for\r\nSt. John’s Day. The ornamentation is as fresh and bright as if done\r\nyesterday, and its text is of the ordinary type, like lmnscr (Evann. 201,\r\n542, 568). It is a very beautiful MS., and an excellent specimen in all\r\nways. (Greg. 521.)\r\n\r\nMr. James Woodhouse [d. 1866], Treasurer-General of the Ionian Islands,\r\nwhile resident fifty years at Corfu, formed a collection of manuscripts\r\nfrom monasteries in the Levant, which was sold in London in 1869, 1872,\r\n1875. Among them were three copies of the Gospels, two Evangelistaria, one\r\ncopy of the Acts and St. Paul.\r\n\r\n*563. London, Brit. Mus. Egerton 2783 [xiii], 5-3/8 × 3-½, ff. 337 (22),\r\n_Carp._, _Eus. t._, _prol._, κεφ. _t._, _pict._, τίτλ., κεφ., _lect._\r\n(ἀρχαί and τέλη), _subscr._, στίχ., _vers._, _syn._, _men._ It was once\r\nfair, but has suffered from damp, and has been sadly cropped by the\r\nWestern binder. _Mut._ John xx. 17. The headings of the Gospels are in\r\nlake. It abounds in curious and unique liturgical notes, whereof Burgon\r\ngives specimens, and it has textual corrections by the original scribe.\r\nCollated by Rose. Bought by Burgon, then belonged to Rev. W. F. Rose, and\r\nbought for the Museum in 1893. (Greg. 714.)\r\n\r\n*564. Brit. Mus. Egerton 2785 [xiv], 10-½ × 8, ff. 226 (27-29), 2 cols.,\r\n_syn._, _men._, scholium on τίτλος α´, _prol._, κεφ. _t._, _pict._, _Am._,\r\nτίτλ., κεφ. (_lect._ later), _subscr._, ῥήμ., στίχ. The ornamentation is\r\nin lake, and at the end are extracts from Eulogius and Hesychius. Upon\r\ncollation by Mr. Rose it exhibits here and there suggestive discrepancies\r\nfrom the common text. Evann. 563, 564 were respectively offered for sale\r\nin 1871 for £50 and £40. Bought by Burgon, belonged to Rose, and purchased\r\nfor Museum in 1893. (Greg. 715.)\r\n\r\n*565. Brit. Mus. Egerton 2784 [xii, Greg. xiv], 8-3/8 × 5-¾, ff. 213\r\n(22-25), κεφ. _t._, τίτλ., κεφ., _Am._, _Eus._, _lect._, ἀναγν.,\r\n_subscr._, ῥήμ., στίχ., fragment of _syn._ Apparently not from the\r\nWoodhouse collection. It is beautifully written and of an uncommon type.\r\nIts older binding suggests a Levantine origin. The readings are far more\r\ninteresting than those of Cod. 564, some of them being quite unique.\r\nBelonged to Burgon, then Rose, then to the Museum in 1893. (Greg. 716.)\r\n\r\n*566. hscr. Brit. Mus. Arund. 524 [xi], 6-¾ × 5-¼, ff. 218 (27), _Carp._,\r\n_Eus. t._, κεφ. _t._, κεφ., τίτλ., _Am._, _Eus._, _lect._, _syn._, _men._,\r\nwas brought to England (with xscr and many others) by the great Earl of\r\nArundel in 1646. Henry Howard, Evelyn’s Duke of Norfolk, presented them to\r\nthe Royal Society, from whose rooms at Somerset House they were\r\ntransferred to the Museum in 1831. (Greg. 476.)\r\n\r\n567. Brit. Mus. Harl. 5538, described in the Harleian Catalogue as an\r\nEvangelistarium, and numbered by Scholz Evst. 149, is a copy of the\r\nGospels [xiv, Greg. xii], 4-¾ × 3-½, ff. 226 (23), _orn._, _lect._, _Am._\r\n(Greg. 505.)\r\n\r\n*568. nscr.

Codd. lmn (542, 201, 568) agree pretty closely. (Greg.\r\n480.)\r\n\r\n*569. oscr. Brit. Mus. Burn. 19 [x], 8-½ × 7, ff. 217 (22), _pict._ (Plate\r\niii, No. 8), in the Escurial as late as 1809, is singularly void of the\r\nusual apparatus. (Greg. 481.)\r\n\r\n*570. pscr. Brit. Mus.

(Greg. 482.)\r\n\r\n*571. rscr. Brit. Mus. Burn. 21, by the same scribe as Cod. 543 [A.D.\r\n1292], 13 × 10, ff. 258 (24), on cotton paper in a beautiful but formed\r\nhand (see Plate vi, No. 15), _syn._, κεφ. _t._, _prol._, _orn._, κεφ.,\r\nτίτλ., _Am._, _lect._, _subscr._, στίχ., _men._ A fine copy, much damaged.\r\nCodd. 543 and 571 differ only in 183 places. (Greg. 484.)\r\n\r\n*572. sscr. Brit. Mus. Burn. 23 [xii], 7-¾ × 6, ff. 230 (23-25), boldly\r\nbut carelessly written, ends John viii. 14: _mut._ Luke v. 22-ix. 32; xi.\r\n31-xiii. 25; xvii. 24-xviii. 4. _Syn._, _Carp._, κεφ. _t._, _orn._, κεφ.,\r\nτίτλ., _Am._, _lect._, _subscr._, στίχ., with many later changes and\r\nweighty readings.

This copy has the subscriptions at the end\r\nof each of the Gospels of SS. Matthew and Mark. There is a probable\r\nreference to them at the end of St. John (ὁμοίως). It is coarsely written\r\non thick vellum, with much _lect._ in vermilion. The breathings and\r\naccents are remarkably incorrect. (Greg. 686.)\r\n\r\n574. Brit. Mus.

Add. 26,103 [xiv], 8 × 6, ff. 242 (25), _orn._, κεφ.,\r\nτίτλ., _Am._ (in gold), _pict._ (John), was found in a village near\r\nCorinth, and bought of C. L. Merlin, our Vice-Consul at Athens, in 1865.\r\nBeautifully written in very black ink, the first page of each Gospel being\r\nin gold. (Greg. 697.)\r\n\r\n602. Brit. Mus.

This noble fragment was bought\r\n(as were Act. 232, Evst. 279, 280) of Sir Ivor B. Guest in 1871, and\r\ncontains the Gospels, Acts, Catholic Epistles, Romans, 1, 2 Corinthians,\r\nGalatians, the rest of the original volume being evidently torn out of the\r\nbook when already bound. In the same year 1871 the Baroness Burdett-Coutts\r\nalso imported from Janina in Epirus sixty-seven leaves containing the rest\r\nof St. Paul’s Epistles and the Apocalypse (B.-C. II. 4, Paul. 266, Apoc.\r\n89), which fragments were described in the second edition of the present\r\nbook. Mr. Edward A. Guy, of Miami University, Oxford, Ohio, U.S.A., on\r\nexamining the Museum fragment in 1875 with my book in his hand, concluded\r\nthat the two portions originally formed one magnificent copy of the whole\r\nNew Testament, and when I brought the two together, I saw that the\r\nilluminated heading and initial capital on the first page of B.-C. II. 4\r\n(Eph. i) was worked off through damp on the _verso_ of the last leaf (302)\r\nof the Museum copy, and the red κεφ. of Gal. vi on the top of B.-C. II. 4,\r\nleaf one, _recto_. In the larger fragment we find two _pict._ of St. Luke\r\n(one of them before the Acts), one of St. John, with illuminated headings.\r\n_Carp._, _Eus. t._, &c. must have perished, as the first page opens with\r\nMatt. i. 1. It has τίτλ. in gold letters on purple vellum, a Harmony at\r\nthe foot of fol. 17 b-18 b, and many brief marginal scholia. _See_ Paul.\r\n266 (B.-C. II. 4), which is at present five miles off, in the Library of\r\nSir Roger Cholmeley’s School, Highgate. (Greg. 699.)\r\n\r\n604. Brit. Mus. Egerton 2610 [xii], 5-¾ × 4-¼, ff. 297 (19), about thirty\r\nletters to a line, _Carp._, _Eus. t._, κεφ. _t._ (Matt., Mark, Luke),\r\nτίτλ., _Am._, _Eus._, _pict._ (beautifully executed). First noticed by\r\nDean Burgon, bought for the Museum in 1882, and collated by Mr. H. C.\r\nHoskier, “Full Account, &c.,” D. Nutt, 1890. According to Mr. Hoskier’s\r\nanalysis it contains no less than 270 quite unique readings, siding at\r\nleast twenty times alone with D, eleven with B, six with א, six with Evan.\r\n1, twenty-nine with Evan. 473. It has 2724 variations from T. R. There are\r\nbesides a vast number of almost unique readings, e.g. Luke xi. 2, for\r\nwhich Greg. Nyss. is about the only authority (Hoskier). (Greg. 700.)\r\n\r\n605. (Act. 233, Paul. 243, Apoc. 106.) Zittaviensis A. 1 [xv], _chart._,\r\nff. 775 (30), _prol._, κεφ. _t._, κεφ., τίτλ., _subscr._, στίχ., _vers._,\r\ngiven to the Senate of Zittau (Lusatian Saxony) in 1620, contains the\r\ncanonical books of the Old Testament down to Esther, with 1 Esdras, 4\r\nMaccabees, Judith, Tobit, and the whole New Testament. Matthaei collated\r\nthe Old Testament portion for Dean Holmes’s edition of the Septuagint\r\n(Cod. 44), and saw its great critical value. It was examined, as so many\r\nothers have been, by Dr. C. R. Gregory. (Greg. 664.)\r\n\r\nThe next two were bought for the Bodleian in 1882: they came from\r\nConstantinople.\r\n\r\n606. Oxf. Bodl. Gr.

(Greg. 708.)\r\n\r\n608. Brit. Mus. Add. 11,859-60 (palimpsest) is a Typicum or Rituale [xiv\r\nor xv], 10 × 7-¾, ff. 39 + 29 (uncertain), from the Butler collection,\r\nhaving written under it an earlier cursive text [xiii] containing, in\r\n11,859, Matt. xii. 33-xiii. 7; xvi. 21-xvii. 15; xx. 1-15; 15-xxi. 5; Mark\r\nx. 45-xi. 17: 198 verses; and in 11,860, only twenty-seven verses of the\r\nCatholic Epistles, James 1-16; Jude 4-15. This is Act. 234. (Greg. 1274?)\r\n\r\n609. Camb. Univ. Libr., Hh. 6. 12 [xv], 8 × 5-¾, _chart._, ff. 182 (20,\r\n&c.), κεφ. _t._, _prol._, _subscr._ This must be Scholz’s 1673 (N. T.,\r\nvol. i. p. cxix), but it contains the Gospels only, not the Acts, as he\r\nsupposes. (Greg. 552.)\r\n\r\n610. Oxf. Bodl.

I. 11 [xii], 3-½ × 2-½, ff. 112 (25-28), is a very small and\r\nbeautiful Ὠδεῖον, containing the Magnificat and Benedictus, besides the\r\n151 Psalms of the Septuagint version, and the Hymns of Moses (Ex. xv.\r\n1-14; Deut. xxxii. 14-43), of Hannah (1 Sam. ii), of Habakkuk (ch. iii),\r\nIsaiah (ch. xxvi), Jonah (ch. ii), with that of the Three Holy Children.\r\nMany such books are extant, of which this is inserted in our list as a\r\nspecimen. _See_ 5pe, note.\r\n\r\nJohn Belsheim, editor of the Codex Aureus, found at Upsal in 1875, and\r\ndescribed to Burgon in 1882, together with Act. 68, three manuscripts in\r\nthe University Library there containing the Gospels only.\r\n\r\n613. Upsala 4, Sparvenfeldt(264) 45 [xi], 5-7/8 × 4-½, ff. 208 (25), _Eus.\r\nt._, κεφ. _t._, _pict._, last leaf later, bought at Venice in 1678. (Greg.\r\n899.)\r\n\r\n614.

Björnsthal to\r\nthe University Library.\r\n\r\n617. Oxf.

H. O. Coxe, late Bodley’s Librarian, though quite unable to\r\npurchase any of the literary treasures he was commissioned to inspect in\r\n1857, added considerably by his research to our knowledge of manuscripts\r\nin the East. A list of them was given in groups by Dr. Scrivener in the\r\nthird edition of this work: but for various reasons they will be found\r\nseparately placed amongst the ensuing MSS., to fill up gaps which have\r\nbeen since discovered in the supplementary list of cursive manuscripts\r\nthat was bound up in the beginning of the last edition.\r\n\r\nThe Evann. 622-735 were reported to Dean Burgon from several Libraries in\r\nreply to his sedulous enquiries. Upon subsequent examination by Dr. C. R.\r\nGregory on the spot, many of them were seen not to be Evangelia, but\r\ninstead of that commentaries of St. Chrysostom, or other commentaries, or\r\nEvangelistaria, or MSS. containing other matter. Thus—including the list\r\nof the Abbé Martin, who extended Dean Burgon’s numeration up to 776—the\r\nfollowing must be excised: 643-665, 667, 673, 677-679, 681, 682, 685, 686,\r\n688, 689, 695, 700-702, 706, 711, 712, 715-722, 724-728 (including 726\r\nwhich Dr. Scrivener noticed as a duplication of 611), 731, 733, 734, 758,\r\n760, 763, 771, 772, 775, 776. Gregory, Prolegomena, pp. 794, 795. The\r\neditor has inserted other MSS. in their places, being especially those\r\nfound by the late Rev. H. O. Coxe in his travels, and enumerated in his\r\nReport to Her Majesty’s Government.\r\n\r\n622. (Act. 242, Paul. 290, Apoc. 110.)

CURSIVE MANUSCRIPTS OF THE GOSPELS. PART III.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have now come to Dr. Gregory’s list, where Dr. Scrivener’s and the Abbé\r\nMartin’s have ceased, and shall follow it, except in the case of MSS.\r\nwhich have been already recorded, and which therefore must be replaced by\r\nother MSS. Whenever no independent information is at hand, the MS. will be\r\nsimply noted, and the reader is referred to Dr. Gregory’s “Prolegomena”\r\nunder the same number. Information from other sources than Dr. Gregory’s\r\nbook will in each case, where the Editor has discovered it, be duly given.\r\nWhenever no reference is made to Dr. Gregory’s list, the numbers in both\r\nlists are the same.\r\n\r\nThe particulars added to MSS. at Athens are taken from the Catalogue by K.\r\nAlcibiades I. Sakkelion, obligingly lent me with others by Mr. J. Rendel\r\nHarris; but the press-marks of the MSS. have apparently been changed since\r\nDr. Gregory examined them, and I have not succeeded in obtaining\r\ninformation upon this point. I have therefore identified the MSS. as best\r\nI could, and have inserted queries when there seemed to be doubt. The\r\nnumber in brackets is the present press-mark. The two measurements often\r\ndiffer; I have followed that of Sakkelion.\r\n\r\n775. Athens, Nat. Sakkelion 3 (58) [xiii], 4-¾ × 4, ff. 223. Belonged to\r\nJohn Cantacuzenus.\r\n\r\n776. Ath. Nat.

CURSIVE MANUSCRIPTS OF THE ACTS AND CATHOLIC EPISTLES.\r\n\r\n\r\n*1. (Evan. 1.)\r\n\r\n2. (Paul. 2.) Basil. Univ. A. N. iv. 4 (formerly B. ix. 38) [xiii or xiv\r\nBurgon], 5-7/8 × 3-7/8, ff. 216 (27), with short Introductions to the\r\nbooks, once belonged to the Preaching Friars, then to Amerbach, a printer\r\nof Basle. Erasmus grounded on this copy, in some passages with some\r\nalterations of the MS., the text of his first edition (1516), and he calls\r\nit “exemplar mirè castigatum.” His binder cut off a considerable part of\r\nthe margin (Hoskier). It is Mill’s B. 2 (Battier, Wetstein).\r\n\r\n3. (Evan. 3.)\r\n\r\n4. (Paul. 4.) Basil. A. N. iv. 5 (formerly B. x. 20) [xv], 6-1/8 × 4-3/8,\r\nff. 287 (18), Mill’s B. 3, badly written by several hands, and full of\r\ncontractions: the Pauline Epistles preceding the Catholic. Erasmus made\r\nsome use of this copy and of its marginal readings (e.g. Acts viii. 37;\r\nxv. 34; xxiv. 6-8) for forming his text (Battier, Wetstein).\r\n\r\n5. (Evan. 5.)\r\n\r\n6. (Evan. 6.)\r\n\r\n7. (Paul. 9.) Paris, Nat. Gr. 102 [x, Greg. xi, Omont xii], 7-¼ × 5-7/8,\r\nff. 390 (20), _prol._, κεφ. _t._, τίτλ., _pict._, seems to be Stephen’s\r\nι᾽, although ι᾽ is cited in error Luke v. 19; John ii. 17: it nearly\r\nresembles Cod. 5 and the Latin version. In this copy, and in Paul. H, 12,\r\n17, 20, 137, Mr. Vansittart re-collated the beginning of the Epistle to\r\nthe Hebrews.\r\n\r\n8. (Paul. 10.) Stephen’s ια᾽, now missing, cited about 400 times by that\r\neditor, in 276 of which it supports the Latin versions (Mill, N. T.,\r\nProleg. § 1171). Stephen cites ια᾽ (apparently in error) four times in the\r\nGospels, once in the Apocalypse (Matt. x. 8; 10; xii. 32; John ii. 17;\r\nApoc. xiii. 4).\r\n\r\n9. (Paul. 11.) Cambridge, Univ. Libr. Kk. 6. 4 [xi], 6-¾ × 4-¾, ff. 247\r\n(22), _lect._ _Mut._ Acts iii. 6-17; 1 Tim. iv. 12-2 Tim. iv. 3; Heb. vii.\r\n20-xi. 10; xi. 23-end. Bp. Marsh has fully proved that this copy, which\r\nonce belonged to Stephen’s friend Vatablus, Professor of Hebrew at Paris,\r\nis his ιγ᾽. This copy also is twice quoted by Stephen in the Gospels\r\n(Matt. xxvii. 64; John ii. 17), through mere oversight. Dr. Hort states\r\nthat it is rich in detached readings in Cath. Epp., not in Acts or Paul.\r\n\r\n10. (Paul. 12, Apoc. 2.) Par. Nat. Gr. 237, Stephen’s ιε᾽ [x], 8-1/8 ×\r\n6-3/8, ff. 246 (28), _prol._, κεφ. _t._, τίτλ., κεφ., _subscr._, στίχ.,\r\nneatly written, with scholia and other matter. Le Long identified this,\r\nand about five other of Stephen’s manuscripts: its value in the Apocalypse\r\nis considerable (Wetstein, Scholz).\r\n\r\n11. (Paul. 140.) Par. Nat. Gr. 103 [x, Greg. xi], 8-½ × 6-¾, ff. 333(18),\r\n_prol._, with scholia. _Mut._ Acts ii. 20-31.\r\n\r\n12. (Paul. 16, Apoc. 4.) Par. Nat. Gr. 219 [xi], 12-3/8 × 9-1/8, ff. 313\r\n(40), _prol._, κεφ. _t._, κεφ., τίτλ., _syn._, _men._, neat, with Arethas’\r\ncommentary on the Apocalypse, and Œcumenius’ on the other books. Like\r\nEvann. 16, 19, 317, it once belonged to the Medici: in 1518 it was given\r\nby the Greek Janus Lascar to “Petro Masieli” of Constance, and was used by\r\nDonatus of Verona for an edition of Œcumenius (Wetstein, Scholz).\r\n\r\n*13. (Evan. 33.)\r\n\r\n14. (Evan. 35.)\r\n\r\n15. Par. Nat. Coislin. 25 [xi], 12-3/8 × 9-¼, ff. 254 (36), _prol._, κεφ.\r\n_t._, κεφ., τίτλ., _subscr._, στίχ., described by Montfaucon (as were also\r\nAct. 16-18), compared with Pamphilus’ revision, _prol._, and a commentary\r\ndigested by Andreas, a priest (Wetstein).\r\n\r\n16. (Paul. 19.) Par. Nat. Coisl. 26 [xi, Greg. x], 11-5/8 × 9, ff. 381\r\n(40), _prol._, with a commentary much like that of Œcumenius, and a catena\r\nof various Fathers: also a life of St. Longinus on two leaves [ix]. It\r\nonce belonged to the monastery of St. Athanasius on Athos, βιβλίον τῆς\r\nτετάρτης θέσεως (Wetstein).\r\n\r\n17. (Paul. 21, Apoc. 19.) Par. Nat. Coisl. 205 [written by Anthony, a\r\nmonk, A.D. 1079, Indict. 2], 9-7/8 × 7, ff. 270 (27), _prol._, κεφ. _t._,\r\nκεφ., τίτλ., _lect._, _subscr._, στίχ., _syn._ _Mut._ 1 Cor. xvi. 17-2\r\nCor. i. 7; Heb. xiii. 15-25; with Apoc. i. 1-ii. 5 in a recent hand\r\n(Wetstein).\r\n\r\n18. (Paul. 22, Apoc. 18.) Par. Nat. Coisl. 202, 2, ff. 1-26 [xi] on\r\nvellum, the rest [xiii] on cotton paper, 9-5/8 × 7-1/8, ff. 302 (22), with\r\nscholia to the Acts and Catholic Epistles, Andreas’ commentary to the\r\nApocalypse, _prol._ to St. Paul’s Epistles (Wetstein).\r\n\r\n19. (Evan. 38.)\r\n\r\n20. (Paul. 25.) Brit. Mus. Royal MS. I. B. I, once Westminster 935 [xiv],\r\n10 × 7-¾, ff. 144 (22), _chart._, _Euthal._, _prol._ in Cath. and Paul.\r\n_Mut._ and in bad condition, almost illegible in parts (Wetstein). The\r\nPauline Epistles precede the Acts and Catholic Epistles. Casley notices\r\none leaf lost in the Hebrews (after ὡς υἱοῖς ὑμῖν πρός ch. xii. 7).\r\n\r\n21. (Paul. 26.) Cambridge, Univ. Libr. Dd. xi. 90 [xiii], 6-½ × 5-¼, ff.\r\n159 (24), _prol._, _lect._, στίχ. _Mut._ Acts i-xii. 2; xiv. 22-xv. 10;\r\nRom. xv. 14-16; 24-26; xvi. 4-20; 1 Cor. i. 15-iii. 12; 2 Tim. i. 1-ii. 4;\r\nTit. i. 9-ii. 15; Philem. ii-end of Hebrews. _Prol._ to Pauline Epistles\r\nonly, copy is Mill’s _Lu_., but he forgot to name it in his Prolegomena.\r\nIt was re-discovered and collated by Wetstein, and is probably Bentley’s Q\r\n(Ellis, Bentleii Critica Sacra, p. xxix). John Berriman, in the manuscript\r\nnotes to his own copy of his “Critical Dissertation on 1 Tim. iii. 16”\r\n(1741), which he presented to the British Museum in 1761, tells us that\r\nthis codex [then Cant. 495] was identified “by several collations of many\r\ntexts by different hands (Professor Francklin and others), and by other\r\ncircumstances” to have been Professor Luke’s (MS. note on p. 104).\r\n\r\n22. (Paul. 75 in the same hand.) Brit. Mus. Add. 5115 and 5116, once Dr.\r\nMead’s (Berriman), then Askew’s [xii], 7-5/8 × 5-¾, ff. 127 + 174 (22),\r\nκεφ. _t._, κεφ., _prol._, _syn._, _lect._ (later). _Mut._ Acts i. 1-11:\r\n(Acts i-xx collated by Paulus for Griesbach: Bloomfield): Scholz’s date\r\n[ix] is an error.\r\n\r\n23.

This copy, given by Christina to Alexander\r\nVIII (1689-91), is of considerable importance, and, as containing all\r\nEuthalius’ labours on the Acts and the Epistles, was largely used by Laur.\r\nZacagni for his edition of the Prologues, &c., of Euthalius (Extracts in\r\nMill, Zacagni, Birch; Griesbach adds, “Gagnaeus eundem sub Dionysiani\r\nnomine laudasse creditur”).\r\n\r\n41.

Stephen’s ζ’ is unknown, though it was once in the Royal\r\nLibrary at Paris; that is, if Evan. 8, Reg. 49, is Stephen’s ζ᾽ in the\r\nGospels, which Mr. Vansittart seems to have proved. Stephen seldom cites\r\nζ᾽, or (as Mill puts the case) “textus ipsius ferè universus absorptus est\r\nin hac editione” (N. T., Proleg. § 1167). _See_ Evan. 8.\r\n\r\n51. (Paul. 133, Apoc. 52.)

It is Mill’s Cant. 3, Scrivener’s n (a facsimile is\r\ngiven Plate xii. No. 33), and is in bad condition, in parts almost\r\nillegible. It begins 2 Pet. ii. 4, and there is a hiatus from 1 John iii.\r\n20 to the middle of Œcumenius’ Prologue to the Romans: _mut._ also 1 Cor.\r\nxi. 7-xv. 56, and ends Heb. xi. 27. From 1 Tim. vi. 5 another and far less\r\ncareful hand begins: but the manuscript exhibits throughout many\r\nabbreviations. Has some marginal notes _primâ manu_.

The second volume of this book\r\n(containing the Acts and all the Epistles on 189 leaves) is judged by the\r\npresent librarian to be a little more modern than the first volume.

(but not in\r\nthe Apocalypse), flourished rubric capitals. Scrivener in 1856 fully\r\ncollated Apoc. (whose text is valuable), the rest slightly.

Munich, Royal Libr. 211 [xi, Delitzsch xiii],\r\n10-5/8 × 8-3/8, ff. 227 (25), _lect._, _prol._, ὑπογραφαί, Dorotheus’\r\ntreatise (_see_ Act. 89), fragments of _Eus. t._, and (in a later hand)\r\nmarginal scholia to St. Paul. Belonged to Zomozerab, the Bohemian. The\r\ntext is very near that commonly received. The portion of this manuscript\r\nwhich contains the Apocalypse is described by Delitzsch, Handschriftliche\r\nFunde, Leipzig, 1862, pp. 45-48, with a facsimile of Apoc. viii. 12, 13.\r\n\r\n180. (Evan. 431.) Important, but seems to have perished in 1870 at\r\nStrasburg.\r\n\r\n181. (Evan. 400(273).)\r\n\r\nThe following codices also are described by Scrivener, Cod.

A later hand [xiv] supplied Acts i. 1-xii. 3; xiii.\r\n5-15; 2, 3 John, Jude. In this copy and 183 the Pauline Epistles precede\r\nthe Catholic. _lect._, _pict._, κεφ., _prol._, _syn._, _men._, ἀποδημίαι\r\nπαύλου, ἀντίφωνα for Easter, and other foreign matter. The various\r\nreadings are interesting, and strongly resemble those of Cod. 69 of the\r\nActs, and Cod. 61 hardly less, especially in Acts xiii-xvii. This is\r\nHort’s Cod. 110.

W. Sanderson of Morpeth. The text much resembles\r\nthat of Act. 61, and is almost identical with that of B.-C. III. 37 (Act.\r\n221) and of Act. 137. This is Hort’s Cod. 112.

It must be regarded as a\r\ncollection of fragments in at least four different hands, pieced together\r\nby the most recent scribe. _Mut._ Acts ii. 36-iii. 8; vii. 3-59; xii.\r\n7-25; xiv. 8-27; xviii. 20-xix. 12; xxii. 7-xxiii. 11; 1 Cor. viii. 12-ix.\r\n18; 2 Cor. i. 1-10; Eph. iii. 2-Phil. i. 24; 2 Tim. iv. 12-Tit. i. 6; Heb.\r\nvii. 19-ix. 12.

B.-C. III. 1, Acts and all the Epistles, the Pauline\r\npreceding the Catholic [xi or xii], 11-½ × 8, ff. 375 (22), on fine\r\nvellum, with broad margins. This is one of the most superb copies extant\r\nof the latter part of the N. T., on which so much cost was seldom bestowed\r\nas on the Gospels. The illuminations before each book, the golden titles,\r\nsubscriptions, and capitals, are very rich and fresh: the rubrical\r\ndirections are in bright red at the top and bottom of the pages. The\r\npreliminary matter consists of _syn._ of the Apostolos, ὑπόθεσις to the\r\nActs, Εὐθαλίου διακόνου περὶ τῶν χρόνων τοῦ κηρύγματος τοῦ ἁγίου παύλου,\r\nκεφ. _t._ of the Acts, in all twenty pages. There are no other tables of\r\nκεφάλαια, but their τίτλοι and κεφ. are given throughout the manuscript.\r\nTo each Epistle is prefixed the ordinary ὑπόθεσις or _prol._, _vers._, and\r\nto eight of them Theodoret’s also. Three leaves at the beginning of\r\nEpistles (containing portions of _prol._ and 2 Cor. i. 1-3; Eph. i. 1-4;\r\nHeb. i. 1-6) have been shamefully cut out for the sake of the\r\nilluminations. A complete menology of eighteen pages closes the volume. At\r\nthe end of Jude we find in golden letters _κε_ _ἰυ_ _χε_ υἱὲ τοῦ θὺ\r\nἐλέησόν με τὸν πολϊαμάρτητον ἀντώνϊον τάχα καὶ μοναχὸν τὸν μαλεύκην.\r\n(Greg. 223.)\r\n\r\n*221. (Paul. 265.) B.-C.

This\r\ncopy is full of instructive variations, being nearest akin to the\r\nHarkleian Syriac _cum asterisco_ and to cscr (184), then to ascr (182),\r\n137, 100, 66**, 69, dscr (185) next to 27, 29, 57**.

Jude 20-25, containing the Acts and all the Epistles, neatly\r\nwritten and bound in the original oak boards. After being offered for £60\r\nin London from 1869 to 1875, it was bought by Dean Burgon, and, like Evan.\r\n563, passed to his nephew, the Rev. W. F. Rose, and was obtained for the\r\nMuseum in 1893. _Prol._, κεφ. _t._, κεφ., τίτλ., ἀρχ. and τέλ., _subscr._,\r\nστίχ., _syn._, _men._, at the beginning, but it has been ill used, and the\r\ntext corrected by an unskilful hand. Its faded ornaments were executed in\r\nlake. (Greg. 229.)\r\n\r\n*224. (Evan. 507) wscr. Hort’s Act. 102. (Greg. 195.)\r\n\r\nBesides the British Museum copies already described (Act. 22, 25-8, 59,\r\n91) we must add:\r\n\r\n*225 or jscr. Lond. Brit. Mus.

A facsimile is exhibited in the\r\nPalaeographical Society’s work, Plate 84. It begins with Euthalii ἔκθεσις\r\nof the chapters of the Acts. Euthalius’ Prologue also precedes the Pauline\r\nEpistles, and that of Arethas (σύνοψις σχολική) the Apocalypse, with a\r\ntable of his seventy-two κεφάλαια. Throughout the volume the numerals\r\nindicating the κεφάλαια of each book stand in the margin in red, and a\r\nlist of the κεφ. before each. There are many marginal glosses in a very\r\nminute hand. _Mut._ 1 Cor. xvi. 15—Prol. to 2 Cor., and one leaf (Eph. v.\r\n3-vi. 16) is supplied [xv] _chart._ There are ten leaves at the end\r\ncontaining foreign matter, by the same hand, and in the colophon, besides\r\nthe date, we read that the monk Andreas wrote it εἰς τὸ ὄρος τοῦ _πρσ_ καὶ\r\nαγ μελετίου τῆς μυοπόλεως ἐν τῇ μονῇ τοῦ _σρσ_, adding of himself (as well\r\nhe might) πολλὰ γὰρ ἐκοπίασα ἐν τρισὶν ἔτεσιν κτίζων αὐτήν.

Mayhingen, Oettingen-Wallerstein [xii], 9-1/8 × 5-7/8, ff. 90 (15 last\r\n_chart._), the only one used in 1516 by Erasmus (who calls it “exemplar\r\nvetustissimum”) and long lost, contains the commentary of Andreas of\r\nCaesarea, in which the text is so completely imbedded that great care is\r\nneeded to separate the one from the other. _Mut._ ch. xxii. 16-21, ending\r\nwith τοῦ _δαδ_. This manuscript was happily re-discovered in 1861 by\r\nProfessor F. Delitzsch at Mayhingen in Bavaria in the library of the\r\nPrince of Oettingen-Wallerstein, and a critical account of it published by\r\nhim (illustrated by a facsimile) in the first part of his\r\n“Handschriftliche Funde” (1861). Tregelles also, in the second part of the\r\nsame work, published an independent collation of his own (with valuable\r\n’Notes’ prefixed), which he had made at Erlangen in 1862. The identity of\r\nApoc. 1 with the recovered copy is manifest from such _monstra_ as\r\nἐβάπτισας ch. ii. 3, which is found in both; from the reading συνάγει ch.\r\nxiii. 10, and from the clauses put wrong by Erasmus, as being lost in the\r\ncommentary, e.g. ch. ii. 17; iii. 5, 12, 15; vi. 11, 15. Of this copy Dr.\r\nHort says (Introd. p. 263) that “it is by no means an average cursive of\r\nthe common sort. On the one hand it has many individualisms and readings\r\nwith small and evidently unimportant attestation: on the other it has a\r\nlarge and good ancient element,... and ought certainly (with the somewhat\r\nsimilar 38) to stand high among secondary documents.”\r\n\r\n2. (Act. 10, Stephen’s ιε᾽.)\r\n\r\n3. Codex Stephani ιϛ᾽, unknown; cited only 77 times throughout the\r\nApocalypse in Stephen’s edition of 1550, and that very irregularly; only\r\nonce (ch. xx. 3) after ch. xvii. 8. It was not one of the copies in the\r\nKing’s Library, and the four citations noticed by Mill (N. T., _prol._ §\r\n1176) from Luke xxii. 30; 67; 2 Cor. xii. 11; 1 Tim. iii. 3, are probably\r\nmere errors of Stephen’s press.\r\n\r\n4. (Act. 12.)\r\n\r\n5. Codices Laurentii Vallae (_see_ Evan. 82); the readings of which\r\nErasmus used.\r\n\r\nCodd. 6, 26, 27, 28 were rather loosely collated for Wetstein by his\r\nkinsman Caspar Wetstein, chaplain to Frederick, Prince of Wales.\r\n\r\n6.

(Act. 17.)\r\n\r\n20. (Evan. 175), a few extracts made by Bianchini: so Apoc. 24.\r\n\r\n21, 22 of Wetstein were two unknown French codices, cited by Bentley in\r\nhis specimen of Apoc. xxii, and made Wetstein’s 23 (Act. 56). Scholz,\r\ndiscarding these three as doubtful, substitutes—\r\n\r\n21. Rom. Vallicell. D. 20 [xiv, Greg. xv], 12-7/8 × 8-½, ff. 93 (28),\r\n_chart._\r\n\r\n22. (Act. 166.)\r\n\r\n23.

Bar. 48 [xv], 8 × 5-½, ff. 24 (22), _chart._, κεφ., τίτλ.,\r\ncontains mixed matter by several hands, and is nscr of the Apocalypse,\r\n_mut._ ch. xvii. 5-xxii. 21 (ch. v. 1-5 is repeated in the volume in a\r\ndifferent hand). This is an important copy, akin to Apocc. 7 and 96.\r\nBentley also named it κ in his collation extant in the margin of Trin.\r\nColl. B. xvii. 5 (_see_ Evan. 51).\r\n\r\n*29. (Act. 60, escr.)\r\n\r\n30. (Act. 69.)\r\n\r\n*31. Lond. Brit. Mus. Harl. 5678 [xv], 11-¼ x 8-½, ff. 244 (24), _chart._,\r\n_prol._, is cscr, but ch. i-viii had been loosely collated for Griesbach\r\nby Paulus. Like Evan. 445 it once belonged to the Jesuits’ College at\r\nAgen, and is important for its readings. Has much miscellaneous matter.\r\n\r\n32. Dresdensis, Reg. A. 124 [xv, Griesb. x], 7-¾ × 4-¾, ff. 16, belonged\r\nto Loescher, then to Brühl, collated by Dassdorf and Matthaei (Mt. t). The\r\nclose resemblance in the text of Apocc. 29-32 is somewhat overstated by\r\nGriesbach.\r\n\r\n*33. (Evan. 218.)\r\n\r\n34. (Act. 66.)\r\n\r\n35. Vindob. Caes. Gr. Theol. 307 [xiv], 7-1/8 × 5-5/8, ff. 32 (20), with\r\nAndreas’ commentary: brought from Constantinople by de Busbeck (Alter).\r\nDescribed by Delitzsch, Handschriftliche Funde (part ii), p. 41 (1862). In\r\ntext it closely resembles Cod. 87.\r\n\r\n36. Vindob. Caes. Suppl. Gr. 93 [xiv, Greg. xiii], 6-3/8 × 4-3/8, ff. 56\r\n(36), _prol._, κεφ., τίτλ., ends ch. xix. 20, with Andreas’ commentary:\r\nthe text is in στίχοι (Alter), having much in common with Codd. א, 7.\r\n\r\n37. (Act. 72.)\r\n\r\n*38. Rom. Vat. Gr. 579 [xiii, Greg. xv], 8-3/8 × 5-¼, ff. 24 (30), on\r\ncotton paper, in the midst of foreign matter. The text (together with some\r\nmarginal readings) (_primâ manu_) closely resembles that of Codd. AC, and\r\nwas collated by Birch, inspected by Scholz and Tregelles, and subsequently\r\nrecollated by B. H. Alford at the request of Tregelles (_see_ Evan. T).\r\n\r\n39. (Paul. 85.)\r\n\r\n40. (Evan. 141.)\r\n\r\n41. Rom. Vat. Reg. Gr. 68 [xiv, Greg. xv], 9-1/8 × 6, ff. 70 (14),\r\n_chart._, _proll._, κεφ. _t._, with extracts from Œcumenius and Andreas’\r\ncommentary (Birch, Scholz: so Apoc. 43).\r\n\r\n42. (Act. 80.)\r\n\r\n43. Rom. Barberini iv. 56 [xiv], 9-¾ × 7, ff. 5 (58) at end, 2 cols.,\r\ncontains ch. xiv. 17-xviii. 20, with a commentary, together with portions\r\nof the Septuagint.\r\n\r\n44.

Moscow, Synod. 67 (Mt. o) [xv], fol., ff. 58, _chart._, with Andreas’\r\ncommentary, and Gregory Nazianzen’s Homilies.\r\n\r\n*50. Mosc. Synod. 206 (Mt. p) [xv], fol. _chart._, ff. 35, like Evann. 69,\r\n206, 233, is partly of parchment, partly paper, from the Iberian monastery\r\non Athos; it also contains lives of the Saints.\r\n\r\n*502. Also from the Iberian monastery [x], is Matthaei’s r, Tischendorf’s\r\n90.\r\n\r\nApocc. 51-84 were added to the list by Scholz, of which he professes to\r\nhave collated Cod. 51 entirely, as Reiche has done after him; 68, 69, 82\r\nnearly entire; twenty-one others cursorily, the rest (apparently) not at\r\nall. Our 87 is Scrivener’s m, collated in the Apocalypse only.\r\n\r\n*51. (Evan. 18.)\r\n\r\n52. (Act. 51.)\r\n\r\n53. (Act. 116.)\r\n\r\n54. (Evan. 263.)\r\n\r\n55. (Act. 118.)\r\n\r\n56.

Suppl. Gr. 99a [xvi], 8-1/8 × 5-5/8, ff. 83, _chart._, with\r\na commentary. Once Giles de Noailles’.\r\n\r\n60. Rom. Vat. Gr. 656 [xiii or xiv], 6-¾ × 4-5/8, ff. 207 (17), _chart._,\r\nwith Andreas’. (_See_ Gregory 79.)\r\n\r\n61. Par. Nat. Gr. 491, once Colbert’s [xiii], 9-½ × 6-1/8, ff. 13, on\r\ncotton paper, _mut._, with extracts from Basil, &c.\r\n\r\n62. Par. Nat. Gr. 239 [A.D. 1422], 8-5/8 × 5-5/8, ff. 119 (26), _chart._,\r\nwith Andreas’ commentary.\r\n\r\n63. Par. Nat. Gr. 241 [xvi], 8-1/8 × 5-7/8, ff. 294, _chart._, with\r\nAndreas’ commentary. Once de Thou’s, then Colbert’s.\r\n\r\n64. (Paul. 159.)\r\n\r\n65. Moscow, Univ. Libr. 25 [xii], 4to, ff. 7 (once Coislin’s 229),\r\ncontains ch. xvi. 20-xxii. 21.\r\n\r\n66. (Act. 419.)\r\n\r\n67. Rom. Vat. Gr. 1743 [dated December 5, 1302], 8-7/8 × 6-½, ff. ?, κεφ.,\r\nτίτλ., with Andreas’ commentary.\r\n\r\n68. Rom. Vat. Gr. 1904, vol. 2 [xi], 11-¼ × 8-1/8, ff. 19, contains ch.\r\nvii, 17-viii. 12; xx. 1-xxii. 21, with Arethas’ commentary, and much\r\nforeign matter. This fragment (as also Apoc. 72 according to Scholz, who\r\nhowever never cites it) agrees much with Cod. A.\r\n\r\n69. (Act. 161.)\r\n\r\n70. (Evan. 386.)\r\n\r\n71. Athens, Nat. Libr. 142 [xv], 5-7/8 × 4-3/8, ff. 233, with other\r\nmatter.\r\n\r\n*72. Rom. Ghigianus R. iv. 8 [xvi], 8-1/8 × 5-¼, ff. ?, _chart._, with\r\nAndreas’ commentary. Collated hastily by the late W. H. Simcox.\r\n\r\n73. Rom. Corsin. 41. E. 37 [xv or xvi], 7-5/8 × 4-7/8, ff. 97 (30), κεφ.,\r\nτίτλ. (_See_ Gregory.)\r\n\r\n74. (Act. 140.)\r\n\r\n75. (Act. 86.)\r\n\r\n76. (Act. 421.)\r\n\r\n77. Florence, Laur. vii. 9 [xv, Greg. xvi], 8-3/8 × 5-½, ff. 363 (25),\r\n_chart._, with Arethas’ commentary.\r\n\r\n78. (Paul. 197.)\r\n\r\n*79. Munich, Reg. Gr. 248 [xvi], 9-1/8 × 6-¼, ff. 84 (28), _chart._,\r\n_prol._, κεφ., τίτλ.; once Sirlet’s, the Apostolic chief notary (_see_\r\nEvan. 373 and Evst. 132), with Andreas’ commentary, whose text it follows.\r\nThat excellent and modest scholar Fred. Sylburg collated it for his\r\nedition of Andreas, 1596, one of the last labours of his diligent life. An\r\nexcellent copy.\r\n\r\n80. Monac. Reg. Gr. 544 (Bengel’s Augustan. 7) [xii Sylburg, xiv Scholz,\r\nwho adds that it once belonged to the Emperor Manuel Palaeologus, A.D.\r\n1400], 8 × 5-¾, ff. 169 (20), _prol._, κεφ., τίτλ., on cotton paper, with\r\nAndreas’ commentary.\r\n\r\n81. Monac. Reg. Gr. 23 [xvi], 14 × 9-¼, ff. 83 (30), _chart._, κεφ.,\r\nτίτλ., with works of Gregory Nyssen, and Andreas’ commentary, used by\r\nTheod. Peltanus for his edition of Andreas, Ingoldstadt, 1547. Peltanus’\r\nmarginal notes from this copy were seen by Scholz.\r\n\r\n82. (Act. 179.)\r\n\r\n83. (Evan. 339): much like Apoc. B.\r\n\r\n84. (Evan. 368.)(280)\r\n\r\n85. Escurial ψ. iii. 17 [xii], “con commentarios Cl. Pablo” (Haenel and\r\nMontana).\r\n\r\n86. (Act. 251.) (Greg. 122.)\r\n\r\n*87. (Act. 178), mscr. See Apoc. 35.\r\n\r\n88. (Evan. 205.)\r\n\r\n*89. (Paul. 266.) B.-C. II. 4. (Greg. 108.)\r\n\r\n*90. Dresd. Reg. A. 95 [x Griesb., Scholz xv], 12-¼ × 9, ff. 16 (30), 2\r\ncols. This is 502 Scholz (Mt. r).\r\n\r\n*91. (Paul. 263.) Rom. Vat. Gr. 1209 [xv], 10-5/8 × 10-3/8, ff. ?. Mico’s\r\ncollation of the modern supplement to the great Cod. B, made for Bentley,\r\nand published in Ford’s “Appendix” to the Codex Alexandrinus, 1799. The\r\nwhole supplement from Heb. ix. 14 ριεῖ τὴν συνείδησιν including the\r\nApocalypse (but not the Pastoral Epistles) is printed at full length in\r\nVercellone and Cozza’s edition of Cod. Vaticanus (1868).\r\n\r\n92. (Evan. 61.) Published by Dr. Barrett, 1801, in his Appendix to Evan.\r\nZ, but suspected to be a later addition. See Apoc. 14, note.\r\n\r\nWm. Kelly, “The Revelation of John edited in Greek with a new English\r\nVersion,” 1860, thus numbers Scrivener’s collations of six copies not\r\nincluded in the foregoing catalogue—\r\n\r\n*93. (Paul. 256 or escr), ascr.\r\n\r\n*94. (Evan. 201), bscr.\r\n\r\n*95. Parham 82. 17, gscr [xii], 10-¼ × 7-¾, brought by the late Lord de la\r\nZouche in 1837 from Caracalla on Athos: it contains an epitome of the\r\ncommentary of Arethas, in a cramped hand much less distinct than the text,\r\nwhich ends at ch. xx. 11. There are no divisions into chapters. This\r\n“special treasure,” as Tregelles calls it, was regarded by him and Alford\r\nas one of the best cursive manuscripts of the Apocalypse: Dr. Hort judges\r\nit inferior to none. It agrees with Cod. A alone or nearly so in ch.\r\nxviii. 8, 10, (19), 23; xix. 14: compare also its readings in ch. xix. 6\r\n(bis), 12.\r\n\r\n*96. Parham 67 (?). 2, hscr [xiv], 11-1/8 × 7-5/8, ff. 22 (28), κεφ., on\r\nglazed paper, very neat, also from Caracalla, complete and in excellent\r\npreservation, with very short scholia here and there. These two\r\nmanuscripts were collated by Scrivener in 1855, under the hospitable roof\r\nof their owner.\r\n\r\n*97. (Evan. 584.) Brit. Mus.

EVANGELISTARIES, OR MANUSCRIPT SERVICE-BOOKS OF THE GOSPELS.\r\n\r\n\r\nHowever grievously the great mass of cursive manuscripts of the New\r\nTestament has been neglected by Biblical critics, the Lectionaries of the\r\nGreek Church, partly for causes previously stated, have received even less\r\nattention at their hands. Yet no sound reason can be alleged for regarding\r\nthe testimony of these Service-books as of slighter value than that of\r\nother witnesses of the same date and character. The necessary changes\r\ninterpolated in the text at the commencement and sometimes at the end of\r\nlessons are so simple and obvious that the least experienced student can\r\nmake allowance for them(282): and if the same passage is often given in a\r\ndifferent form when repeated in the same Lectionary, although the fact\r\nought to be recorded and borne in mind, this occasional inconsistency must\r\nno more militate against the reception of the general evidence of the copy\r\nthat exhibits it, than it excludes from our roll of critical authorities\r\nthe works of Origen and other Fathers, in which the selfsame variation is\r\neven more the rule than the exception. Dividing, therefore, the\r\nLectionaries that have been hitherto catalogued (which form indeed but a\r\nsmall portion of those known to exist in Eastern monasteries and Western\r\nlibraries) into Evangelistaria, or Evangeliaria, containing extracts from\r\nthe Gospels, and Praxapostoli or Apostoli comprising extracts from the\r\nActs and Epistles; we purpose to mark with an asterisk the few that have\r\nbeen really collated, including them in the same list with the majority\r\nwhich have been examined superficially, or not at all. Uncial copies (some\r\nas late as the eleventh century) will be distinguished by [+]. The uncial\r\ncodices of the Gospels amount to one hundred and six, those of the Acts\r\nand Epistles only to seven or eight, but probably to more in either case,\r\nsince all is not known about some of the Codd. recorded here. Lectionaries\r\nare usually (yet see below, Evst. 111, 142, 178, 244, 249, 255, 256, 262,\r\n266, 268, 275, Apost. 52, 69) written with two columns on a page, like the\r\nCodex Alexandrinus, FGI (1-6, 7) LMNbPQRTUXΘdΛ, 8, 184, 207, 360, 418,\r\n422, 463, 509 of the Gospels, and Cod.

It abounds in uncouth _itacisms_. After Mr. Woodhouse’s\r\ndeath it belonged to Alderman Bragge from 1869 to 1876, then to Dean\r\nBurgon, then to Rev. W. F. Rose. Bought in 1893. (Greg. 346.)\r\n\r\n256. Lond. Brit. Mus. Arundel 536 [xiii], 9 × 6, ff. 217 (25), besides 3\r\nat beginning, _chart._, _mus. rubr._, with Lections from the Epistles.\r\n(Greg. 187.)\r\n\r\n*[+] 257.

(_see_ facsimile, Plate xiii, No. 37), remarkable for its\r\nwide departures from the received text, and for that reason often cited by\r\nTischendorf and Alford on the Gospels. See also Westcott, in Smith’s\r\nDictionary of the Bible, “New Testament.” Part of the first leaf (John i.\r\n11-13) is on paper and later: Evst. 257, 259 are described in Scrivener’s\r\n“Collations of the Holy Gospels,” Introd. pp. lix-lxiii.

Madden’s note on the first fragment is\r\n“Presented by Mr. Harris of Alexandria, June 28, 1848. A leaf of a Greek\r\nLectionary taken [_by the Arabs_ deleted] out of a volume which afterwards\r\nfell into the hands of Gen. Menou.” _See_ Act. 230. (Greg. 190.)\r\n\r\n263. Lond. Brit. Mus.

Alefson, which ends literally thus: “Je l’ai acheté seulement pour le\r\nsauver des mains barbares qui allait le destruire intierement au prix de\r\nsch. 15 a Chypre, A.D. 1851.” (Bloomfield.)

Lampros of Athens in 1859: as were\r\nalso Evst. 270, 271, 272. Seven leaves of Patristic matter are bound up\r\nwith it at the end. (Greg. 321.)\r\n\r\n270. Lond. Brit. Mus. Add. 22,742 [xiii], 11-½ × 8-¾, ff. 79 (24), 2\r\ncols., _mus. rubr._ (later), rather old and much mutilated throughout.\r\n(Greg. 322.)\r\n\r\n271. Lond. Brit. Mus.

(Greg. 323.)\r\n\r\nEvst. 265, 269, 271 sometimes agree with each other in departing from the\r\nordinary week-day Church Lessons, and suggest, as Dean Burgon observes,\r\nsome local fashion which is well worth investigating for textual purposes.\r\nThe student will have noticed, in our Table of Lessons appended to Chap.\r\nIII, how often two other codices, Apost. 64, or B.-C. III. 24 and Evst.\r\n253, or B.-C. III. 42, depart from the common use of Church Lesson books,\r\nbut only for the middle days of the week: not, it would seem, for\r\nSaturdays and Sundays.\r\n\r\n272. Lond. Brit. Mus. Add. 22,744 [xiii], 11 × 8-¼, ff. 189 (23), 2 cols.,\r\na beautiful copy, _mut._ at the beginning (to Sat. of third week), the\r\nend, and elsewhere, with red musical notes. _See_ Evst. 269.

Guest, as was\r\n\r\n280. Lond. Brit. Mus. Add. 28,818 [July, 1272], 9-¾ × 7, ff. 118 (27), 2\r\ncols., _chart._, begins John xvii. 20. The subscription states that it was\r\nwritten διὰ χειρὸς ἐμοῦ τοῦ ἁμαρτωλοῦ τολμῶ εἰπεῖν τοῦ ἱερέως τοῦ\r\nμεταξάρη. (Greg. 331.)\r\n\r\n*281. Lond. Brit. Mus. Add. 31,208 [xiii], 12-½ × 9-½, ff. 272 (21), 2\r\ncols., _mus. rubr._, bought of a dealer at Constantinople, cruelly\r\nmutilated (eighty-four leaves being missing), but once very fine. Collated\r\nby the Rev. W. F. Rose, who found it much to resemble Evst. 259 (yscr).\r\n\r\nBurgon gives a French version of an Armenian note, dated 908 of the\r\nArmenian era, or A.D. 1460, of no special interest. (Greg. 333.)\r\n\r\n282. Lond. Brit. Mus. Add. 31,919 [A.D. 1431], 12-¾ × 10, ff. 108,\r\nformerly Blenheim 3. D. 13, the uncial eighth century palimpsest of the\r\nGospels we have designated as Υ, contains Lessons from the Gospels,\r\nwritten by Ignatius, Metropolitan of Selymbria in Thrace, being the\r\nFebruary portion of a Menaeum. (Greg. 334.)\r\n\r\n283. Lond. Brit. Mus. Add. 31,920 [xi], 9-¼ × 8, ff. 226 (21), 2 cols.,\r\nformerly Blenheim 3. C. 14, containing only σαββατοκυριακαί (_see_ Evst.\r\n24), singularly unadorned, but very interesting and genuine. (Greg. 335.)\r\n\r\n284. Lond. Brit. Mus. Add. 31,921 [xiii], 10 × 8, ff. 178 (24), 2 cols.,\r\n_mus. rubr._, _mut._, formerly Blenheim 3. C. 13, with Church Lessons for\r\nevery day of the week. Several pages in a recent hand stand at the\r\nbeginning: the first hand commences Matt. vi. 31. (Greg. 336.)\r\n\r\n285. Lond. Brit. Mus. Add. 31,949 [xiii], 11 × 8-½, ff. 103 (27), 2 cols.,\r\nmuch dilapidated and _mut._, was a gift to the Museum. (Greg. 337.)\r\n\r\n[+]286. Sinai, St. Catharine’s, Golden Evst.

For specimen of writing, &c., _see_ Burgon, Aug. 9, 1882. It was\r\nseen in 1862 by Burgon, in 1864 by the Rev. E. M. Young, and Mr. Jo. Dury\r\nGeden (_Athenaeum_, Nov. 12 and 19, 1864). It is said to be deteriorated\r\nby the promiscuous handling of strangers, although E. A. Sophocles tells\r\nus that local tradition absurdly assigns it to the Emperor Theodosius [d.\r\n395] as the actual scribe; unless, as Mr. Geden suggests, Theodosius III\r\n(A.D. 716) be meant. The volume opens with the Gospels for the first five\r\ndays of Easter week, which are followed by about sixty-five more from\r\nother parts of the yearly services. (Greg. 300.)\r\n\r\n*287. (Act. 42, Apost. 56) contains only Matt. xvii. 16-23. (Greg. 923.)\r\n\r\n288. Oxf. Bodl. Misc. Gr. 307 [xii], 12 × 9-½, ff. 335 (22), 2 cols.,\r\n_pict._, _mus. rubr._, _men._, very beautiful. Mr. Madan of the Bodleian\r\ntranscribed a note on the last leaf, showing that it once belonged to the\r\nPalaeologi. (Greg. 341.)\r\n\r\n289. Oxf. Bodl. Misc. Gr. 308, from Constantinople [xii or xiii], 11-½ ×\r\n9-¼, ff. 217 (21), 2 cols., _mus. rubr._, _men._ Initial letters of\r\nByzantine character, σαββατοκυριακαί (_see_ Evst. 24), has lost a very few\r\nlines at the end.

I have had a\r\ndifficult task in steering between my duty to the learned public _in __\r\nthe short time_ allowed me for the preparation of this edition, and the\r\ndesire of Dr. Gregory that I should not take more of the information\r\nsupplied in his work than I could help. What I have chiefly done has been\r\nto insert his measurements, where I could obtain no others, translating\r\nthem into inches, and some other particulars upon such MSS. as had been\r\nalready described in the third edition. In the case of the\r\nnewly-discovered MSS., which have been first recorded by Dr. Gregory, I\r\nhave only mentioned them, with a general reference to Dr. Gregory’s book,\r\nexcept where information from other sources has come to hand. I have the\r\npleasure of paying a tribute in the case of MSS. which I have examined\r\nupon his track to the great skill and accuracy of his examinations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX B. ON FACSIMILES.\r\n\r\n\r\nSince the application of photography in its more perfect forms to\r\nmanuscripts for the purpose of representing their character accurately to\r\nscholars who have no opportunity of examining the manuscripts for\r\nthemselves, the older facsimiles have in greater measure lost their value.\r\nIt seems, therefore, hardly worth while to refer to the collections of\r\nfacsimiles made by Montfaucon, or Bianchini, or Silvestre, or Westwood,\r\nother representations when they are to be had being so much more faithful\r\nand instructive.\r\n\r\nThe following are some of the most valuable of recent collections:—\r\n\r\n1. Palaeographical Society, Facsimiles of MSS. and Inscriptions, ed. E. A.\r\nBond, E. M. Thompson, and G. F. Warner, first series, 3 vols., London,\r\n1873-1883; second series, 1884, &c., in progress, fol.\r\n\r\nThis collection contains the following Gr. Test.

ON DATING BY INDICTION.\r\n\r\n\r\nSome account of the old way of dating Greek MSS. by indiction has been\r\nalready given (p. 42, n. 2), but it may be convenient to our readers to\r\nhave a fuller description to refer to. Such a description may be found in\r\nMr. Maunde Thompson’s admirable Manual on Greek and Latin Palaeography,\r\npp. 322-3, which, by the kind permission of the author, is reproduced\r\nhere.\r\n\r\n“Mediaeval Greek MSS. are dated sometimes by the year of the indiction,\r\nsometimes by the year of the world according to the era of Constantinople,\r\nsometimes by both indiction and year of the world.\r\n\r\n“The Indiction was a cycle of fifteen years, which are severally styled\r\nIndiction 1, Indiction 2, &c., up to Indiction 15, when the series begins\r\nafresh. The introduction of this system is attributed to Constantine the\r\nGreat. From the circumstance of the commencement of the indiction being\r\nreckoned variously from different days, four kinds of indictions have been\r\nrecognized, viz.:—\r\n\r\n“i. The Indiction of Constantinople, calculated from the 1st of September,\r\nA.D. 312.\r\n\r\n“ii. The Imperial or Caesarian Indiction (commonly used in England and\r\nFrance), beginning on the 24th of September, A.D. 312.\r\n\r\n“iii. The Roman or Pontifical Indiction (commonly used in dating papal\r\nbulls from the ninth to the fourteenth century), beginning on the 1st of\r\nJanuary (or the 25th of December, when that day was reckoned as the first\r\nday of the year), A.D. 313.\r\n\r\n“iv. The Indiction used in the register of the parliament of Paris,\r\nbeginning in October.\r\n\r\n“The Greeks made use of the Indiction of Constantinople(290).\r\n\r\n“To find the indiction of a year of the Christian era, add 3 to the year\r\n(because A.D. 1= Indiction 4), and divide the sum by 15: if nothing\r\nremains, the indiction will be 15; if there is a remainder, it will be the\r\nnumber of the indiction. But it must not be forgotten that the Indiction\r\nof Constantinople begins on the first of September, and consequently that\r\nthe last four months of a year of the Christian era belong to the next\r\nindiction year.\r\n\r\n“The year of the Creation of the World was calculated, according to the\r\nera of Constantinople, to be B.C. 5508. The first day of the year was the\r\n1st of September.\r\n\r\n“To reduce the Mundane era of Constantinople to the Christian era, deduct\r\n5508 from the former for the months of January to August; and 5509 for\r\nSeptember to December.\r\n\r\n“A chronological table, showing the corresponding years of the Mundane\r\nera, the Christian era, and the Indiction, from A.D. 800 to A.D. 1599,\r\nwill be found in Gardthausen’s ‘Griechische Palaeographie,’ pp. 450-459.”\r\n\r\nMr. Thompson also refers to an article by Mr. Kenyon in _The Classical\r\nReview_, March, 1893, p. 110, where the Egyptian puzzle is noticed, to one\r\nby Wilcken in “Hermes,” xxviii. p. 230, and one by Viereck in\r\n“Philologus,” lii. p. 219, and generally to the interesting and valuable\r\nIntroduction to the British Museum upon Greek Papyri.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX D. ON THE ῬΗΜΑΤΑ.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following ingenious and probably sound explanation of what has been\r\nlong a _crux_ to Textual Critics, comes from a Lecture by Mr. Rendel\r\nHarris, “On the Origin of the Ferrar Group,” delivered at Mansfield\r\nCollege, Oxford, on Nov. 6, 1893, and since published (C. J. Clay and\r\nSons), and courteously sent to the editor by the accomplished author. The\r\nexplanation is given in Mr. Harris’ own words (pp. 7-10): but the whole of\r\nhis pamphlet should be consulted by those who are interested in this\r\nstudy.\r\n\r\n“In Scrivener’s Introduction to the New Testament (ed. 3, p. 65) we are\r\ntold that ‘besides the division of the text into στίχοι or lines, we find\r\nin the Gospels alone another division into ῥήματα or ῥήσεις, “sentences,”\r\ndiffering but little from the στίχοι in number. Of these last the precise\r\nnumbers vary in different copies, though not considerably, &c.’ And on p.\r\n66 we find the following statistical statement:\r\n\r\n“Matthew has 2522 ῥήματα\r\nMark, 1675\r\nLuke, 3803\r\nJohn, 1938\r\n\r\n“These figures are derived from MSS. of the Gospels, in which we\r\nfrequently find the attestation given both of the ῥήματα and the στίχοι:\r\ne.g. Cod. Ev. 173 gives for\r\n\r\n“Matthew ,βφκβ᾽ ῥήματα, ,βφξ᾽ στίχοι,\r\n\r\nwhile the corresponding figures for Mark and Luke are\r\n\r\nMark ,αχοε’ ,αχδ᾽ and Luke ,γωγ᾽ ,βψν᾽\r\n\r\n“No explanation, as far as I know, has ever been given of these curiously\r\nnumbered ῥήματα. The word is, certainly, a peculiar one to use, if short\r\nsentences are intended, such as are commonly known by the terms ‘cola and\r\ncommata.’\r\n\r\n“It has occurred to me that perhaps the explanation might lie in the fact\r\nthat ῥῆμα was here a literal translation of the Syriac word ܦܬܓܡܐ (or\r\nܐܡܓܬܦ). Let us then see whether ܦܬܓܡܐ (or ܐܡܓܬܦ) is the proper word to\r\ndescribe a verse, either a fixed verse, like a hexameter, or a sense-line.\r\nA reference to Payne Smith’s Lexicon will show that it may be used in\r\neither of these senses, for example, we are told that it is not only used\r\ngenerally of the verses of Scripture, but that it may stand for ‘_comma,\r\nmembrum versus, sententia brevior quam versus,_ στίχος, Schol. ad Hex.\r\nJob. ix. 33; ܦܬܓܡܐ ܡܒ (or ܒܡ ܐܡܓܬܦ), Tit. ib. Ps. ix; ܦܬܓܡܐ  ܐܠܦܐܒ (or\r\nܒܐܦܠܐ ܐܡܓܬܦ). Ex. xxx. 22 marg.: insunt in Geneseos libro ܦܬܓܡܐ (or ܐܡܓܬܦ)\r\nMMMMDIX, coloph. ad Gen., it. C.S.B. 2 et sic ad fin. cuiusque libri; in\r\nlibris poeticis sententia est hemistichio minor, e.g. in Ps. i. insunt\r\nversus sex sed ܦܬ ܞܕ (or ܕܞ ܬܦ); in Ps. ii. versus duodecim, sed ܦܬ ܠܚ (or\r\nܚܠ ܬܦ).’\r\n\r\n“It seems, therefore, to be used in Syriac much in the same way as στίχος\r\nin Greek.\r\n\r\n“Now there is in one of the Syriac MSS. on Mount Sinai (Cod. Sin. Syr.) a\r\ntable of the Canonical books of the Old and New Testaments with their\r\nmeasured verses. We will give some extracts from this table; but first,\r\nnotice that the Gospels are numbered as follows:\r\n\r\nMatthew has 2522 ܦܬܓܡܐ (or ܐܡܓܬܦ)\r\nMark has 1675\r\nLuke has 3083\r\nJohn has 1737\r\n\r\nand the whole of the four Evangelists 9218, which differs slightly from\r\nthe total formed by addition, which, as the figures stand, is 9017.\r\n\r\n“On comparing the table with the numbers given by Scrivener from Greek\r\nMSS., viz.\r\n\r\nMatt. = 2522 ῥήματα\r\nMark  = 1675\r\nLuke  = 3803\r\nJohn  = 1938\r\n\r\nwe see at a glance that we are dealing with the same system; Luke should\r\nevidently have 3083, the Greek number being evidently an excessive one;\r\nand if we assume that John should be 1938 the total amounts exactly to the\r\n9218 given for the four Gospels.\r\n\r\n“This is very curious, and since the ῥήματα are now proved to be rightly\r\nequated to ܦܬܓܡܐ (or ܐܡܓܬܦ), and this latter word is a proper word to\r\ndescribe a verse or στίχος, the ῥήματα appear to be a translation of a\r\nSyriac table.\r\n\r\n“Perhaps we may get some further idea about the character of the verses in\r\nquestion by turning to the Sinai list, which is not confined to the\r\nGospels, but ranges through the whole of the Old and New Testaments.\r\n\r\n“The Stichometry in question follows the list of the names of the seventy\r\ndisciples, which list is here assigned to Irenaeus, bishop of Lugdunum.\r\nAfter which we have\r\n\r\nܬܘܒ ܚܘܦܒܢܐ ܕܘܠܢܝܢܐ ܕܒܬܒܐ\r\nܩܕܝܫܐ܃ ܕܟܘܠ ܦܬܓܘܠܐ ܐܬ\r\nܠܚܕ ܚܕ ܡܢ܃ ܒܕܬܐ\r\nܦܬܓܡܐ ܐܕܒܠܐ ܐܠܦܞܢ ܘܝܡܫܡܐ\r\nܘܫܬܬܠܣ܃\r\n\r\ni.e.Genesis has 4516 verses followed by:\r\n               Exodus               3378\r\n               Leviticus            2684\r\n               Numbers              3481\r\n               Deuteronomy          2982\r\n               Total for the Law   17041\r\n               Joshua               1953\r\n               Judges               2088\r\n               &c.\r\n\r\n“When we come to the New Testament, it seems at first sight as if the\r\nverses which are there reckoned cannot be the Greek equivalent hexameters:\r\nfor we are told that Philemon contains 53 verses, and the Epistle to Titus\r\n116, numbers which are in excess of the Euthalian reckoning, 38 and 97\r\nverses respectively, and similarly in other cases. The suggestion arises\r\nthat the lines here reckoned are sense lines, and this is therefore the\r\nmeaning to be attached to the ῥήματα of the MSS. But upon this point we\r\nmust not speak too hastily.\r\n\r\n“The interest of the Sinai stichometry is not limited to this single\r\npoint: its list of New Testament books is peculiar in order and contents.\r\nThere seem to be no Catholic Epistles, and amongst the Pauline Epistles,\r\nGalatians stands first; note also the curious order Hebrews, Colossians,\r\nEphesians, Philippians.\r\n\r\n“I do not think there can be the slightest doubt that our explanation of\r\nthe origin of the ῥήματα is correct.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX E.

I.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES\r\n\r\n\r\n    1 Unfortunately, it did not occur to us till after the work was nearly\r\n      all in type to transfer the Lithographed Plates to places opposite\r\n      the pages which they chiefly illustrate, and that in consequence a\r\n      few expressions in the text ought to be altered. The advantage of\r\n      this arrangement appears to be so great as to overbalance the slight\r\n      inaccuracies alluded to, which cannot now be removed. The plates and\r\n      their references will, it is hoped, be found easily from the\r\n      explanations here given.\r\n\r\n    2 In later manuscripts Proper Names are often distinguished by a\r\n      horizontal line placed over them, but no such examples occur in\r\n      these Plates.\r\n\r\n    3 The reader will observe throughout these specimens that the\r\n      breathings and accents are usually attached to the _first_ vowel of\r\n      a diphthong.\r\n\r\n    4 “Remarks upon a late Discourse of Free Thinking by Phileleutherus\r\n      Lipsiensis,” Part i, Section 32.\r\n\r\n    5 I cite from the late Canon Cureton’s over-literal translation in his\r\n      “Remains of a very antient recension of the four Gospels in Syriac,”\r\n      in the Preface to which (pp. xxxv-xxxviii) is an elaborate\r\n      discussion of the evidence for this passage.\r\n\r\n    6 But see Dean Burgon’s “The Revision Revised,” pp. 358-361.\r\n\r\n    7 The word ἡτακισμός or ἰτακισμός is said to have been first used by\r\n      Cassiodorus (A.D. 468-560?). See Migne, Patr. Lat. t. 70, col. 1128.\r\n\r\n    8 To this list of examples from the Book of Common Prayer, Dean Burgon\r\n      (“The last twelve verses of St. Mark’s Gospel Vindicated” p. 215)\r\n      adds the Gospels for Quinquagesima, 2nd Sunday after Easter, 9th,\r\n      12th, and 22nd after Trinity, Whitsunday, Ascension Day, SS. Philip\r\n      and James, All Saints.\r\n\r\n    9 Dean Alford (see his critical notes on Luke ix. 56; xxiii. 17) is\r\n      reasonably unwilling to admit this source of corruption, where the\r\n      language of the several Evangelists bears no close resemblance\r\n      throughout the whole of the parallel passages.\r\n\r\n   10 The oldest manuscripts seem to elide the final syllable of ἀλλά\r\n      before nouns, but not before verbs: e.g. John vi. 32, 39. The common\r\n      text, therefore, seems wrong in Rom. i. 21; iv. 20; v. 14; viii. 15;\r\n      1 Cor. i. 17; vi. 11; ix. 27; xiv. 34; 1 Pet. ii. 25; Jude 9. Yet to\r\n      this rule there are many exceptions, e.g. Gal. iv. 7 ἀλλὰ υἱός is\r\n      found in nearly all good authorities.\r\n\r\n   11 Tischendorf indeed (Nov. Test. 1871), from a suggestion of Granville\r\n      Penn in loc., says, “ΚΥΡΙΩ omnino scribi solet _ΚΩ_,” and this no\r\n      doubt is the usual form, even in manuscripts which have _χρω ιηυ_,\r\n      as well as _χω ιυ_, for χριστῷ ἰησοῦ. Yet the Codex Augiensis (Paul.\r\n      F) has _κρν_ in 1 Cor. ix. 1.\r\n\r\n   12 Especially, yet not always, at the end of a line. Και in καιρός is\r\n      actually thus written in Cod. Sinaiticus (א), 1 Macc. ix. 7; xv. 33;\r\n      Matt. xxi. 34; Rom. iii. 26; Heb. xi. 11; Apoc. xi. 18. So Cod.\r\n      Sarravianus of the fourth century in Deut. ix. 20, Cod. Rossanensis\r\n      of the sixth (but only twice in the text), the Zurich Psalter of the\r\n      seventh century is Ps. xcvii. 11; cvi. 3; cxvi. 5, and the Bodleian\r\n      Genesis (ch. vi. 13) of about a century later. Similarly, καινήν is\r\n      written κνην in Cod. B. 2 John 5.\r\n\r\n   13 My departed friend, Dr. Tregelles, to whose persevering labours in\r\n      sacred criticism I am anxious, once for all, to express my deepest\r\n      obligations, ranged various readings under three general\r\n      heads:—_substitutions_; _additions_; _omissions_. Mr. C. E. Hammond,\r\n      in his scholarlike little work, “Outlines of Textual Criticism\r\n      applied to the N. T., 1876, 2nd edition,” divides their possible\r\n      sources into Unconscious or unintentional errors, (1) of _sight_;\r\n      (2) of _hearing_; (3) of _memory_: and those that are Conscious or\r\n      intentional, viz. (4) incorporation of marginal glosses; (5)\r\n      corrections of harsh or unusual forms of words, or expressions; (6)\r\n      alterations in the text to produce supposed harmony with another\r\n      passage, to complete a quotation, or to clear up a presumed\r\n      difficulty; (7) Liturgical insertions. While he enumerates (8)\r\n      alterations for dogmatic reasons, he adds that “there appears to be\r\n      no strong ground for the suggestion” that any such exist (Hammond,\r\n      p. 17). Professor Roberts (“Words of the New Testament” by Drs.\r\n      Milligan and Roberts, 1873) comprehends several of the foregoing\r\n      divisions under one head: “Again and again has a word or phrase been\r\n      slipped in by the transcriber which had no existence in his copy,\r\n      but which was due to the working of his own mind on the subject\r\n      before him.” His examples are ἔρχεται inserted in Matt. xxv. 6;\r\n      ἰδοῦσα in Luke i. 29; ὑπὲρ ἡμῶν in Rom. viii. 26 (Part 1. Chap. 1.\r\n      pp. 5, 6).\r\n\r\n   14 This source of variations, though not easily discriminated from\r\n      others, must have suggested itself to many minds, and is well\r\n      touched upon by the late Isaac Taylor in his “History of the\r\n      Transmission of Antient Books to modern times,” 1827, p. 24. So Dr.\r\n      Hort, when perplexed by some of the textual problems which he fails\r\n      to solve, throws out as an hypothesis not in itself without\r\n      plausibility, the notion of “a first and a second edition of the\r\n      Gospels, both conceivably apostolic” (Gr. Test. Introduction, p.\r\n      177).\r\n\r\n   15 “Novum Testamentum Textûs Stephanici A.D. 1550 ... curante F. H. A.\r\n      Scrivener.” Cantabr. 1877 (Editio Major, 1887).\r\n\r\n   16 In this manner we propose to indicate the dates of the birth and\r\n      death of the person whose name immediately precedes.\r\n\r\n   17 “Greek and Latin Palaeography,” Chaps. II, III.\r\n\r\n   18 “Recent investigations have thrown doubts on the accuracy of this\r\n      view; and a careful analysis of many samples has proved that,\r\n      although cotton was occasionally used, no paper that has been\r\n      examined is entirely made of that substance, hemp or flax being the\r\n      more usual material.” Maunde Thompson, p. 44.\r\n\r\n   19 Tischendorf (Notitia Codicis Sinaitici, p. 54) carried to St.\r\n      Petersburg a fragment of a Lectionary which cannot well be assigned\r\n      to a later date than the ninth century, among whose parchment leaves\r\n      are inserted two of cotton paper, manifestly written on by the\r\n      original scribe.\r\n\r\n   20 “Ten Years Digging in Egypt,” pp. 120, &c.\r\n\r\n   21 “Greek and Latin Palaeography,” p. 35; Pliny, Nat. Hist. xiii. 11.\r\n\r\n   22 “Nam, quod in palimpsesto, laudo equidem parcimoniam,” Cicero, Ad\r\n      Diversos, vii. 18, though of a waxen tablet. Maunde Thompson, p. 75.\r\n\r\n   23 “Habeant qui volunt veteres libros, vel in membranis purpureis auro\r\n      argentoque descriptos.” Praef. in Job. “Inficiuntur membranae colore\r\n      purpureo, aurum liquescit in litteras.” Epist. ad Eustochium.\r\n\r\n   24 Miniatures are found even as early as in the Cod. Rossanensis (Σ) at\r\n      the beginning of the sixth century.\r\n\r\n   25 This paragraph which has been rewritten, has been abridged from Mr.\r\n      Maunde Thompson’s “Greek and Latin Palaeography,” pp. 50-52, to\r\n      which readers are referred for verification and amplification.\r\n\r\n   26 “Greek and Latin Palaeography,” p. 49.\r\n\r\n   27 Besides the Cod. Sinaiticus, the beautiful Psalter purchased by the\r\n      National Library from the Didot sale at Paris has four columns (Mr.\r\n      J. Rendel Harris), and besides the Cod. Vaticanus, the Vatican Dio\r\n      Cassius, the Milan fragment of Genesis, two copies of the Samaritan\r\n      Pentateuch at Nablous described by Tischendorf (Cod. Frid.-Aug.\r\n      Proleg. § 11), the last part of Cod. Monacensis 208 (Evan, 429), and\r\n      two Hebrew MSS. Cod. Mon. Heb. 422, and Cod. Reg. Heb. 17, are\r\n      arranged in _three_ columns. Tischendorf has more recently\r\n      discovered a similar arrangement in two palimpsest leaves of Wisdom\r\n      and Ecclesiasticus from which he gives extracts (Not. Cod. Sinait.\r\n      p. 49); in a Latin fragment of the Pentateuch, the same as the\r\n      Ashburnham manuscript below, seen by him at Lyons in 1843; in a\r\n      Greek Evangelistarium of the eighth century, and a Patristic\r\n      manuscript at Patmos of the ninth (ibid. p. 10); so that the\r\n      argument drawn from the _triple_ columns must not be pressed too\r\n      far. He adds also a Turin copy of the Minor Prophets in Greek\r\n      (Pasinus, Catalogue, 1749), and a Nitrian Syriac codex in the\r\n      British Museum “quem circa finem quarti saeculi scriptum esse\r\n      subscriptio testatur” (Monum. sacra inedita, vol. i, Proleg. p.\r\n      xxxi). To this not slender list Mr. E. Maunde Thompson enables us to\r\n      annex B. M. Addit. 24142, a Flemish Latin Bible of the eleventh\r\n      century. The late Lord Ashburnham in 1868 printed his Old Latin\r\n      fragments of Leviticus and Numbers, also in three columns, with a\r\n      facsimile page; and the famous Utrecht Psalter, assigned by some to\r\n      the sixth century, by others to the ninth or tenth, is written with\r\n      three columns on a page.\r\n\r\n   28 “Uncialibus, ut vulgo aiunt, literis, onera magis exarata, quam\r\n      codices,” Hieronymi Praef. in Job. From this passage the term\r\n      _uncial_ seems to be derived, _uncia_ (an inch) referring to the\r\n      size of the characters. Yet the conjectural reading “_initialibus_”\r\n      will most approve itself to those who are familiar with the small\r\n      Latin writing of the Middle Ages, in which _i_ is undotted, and _c_\r\n      much like _t_.\r\n\r\n   29 The Cotton fragment of the book of Genesis of the fifth century,\r\n      whose poor shrivelled remains from the fire of 1731 are still\r\n      preserved in the British Museum, while in common with all other\r\n      _manuscripts_ it exhibits the round shapes of Ο and Θ, substitutes a\r\n      lozenge [symbol] for the circle in _phi_, after the older fashion\r\n      ([symbol somewhat like a squared Phi]). _Phi_ often has much the\r\n      same shape in Codex Bezae; e.g. Matt. xiii. 26, Fol. 42 _b_, 1. 13,\r\n      and once in Codex Z (Matt. xxi. 26, Plate xlviii).\r\n\r\n   30 Our facsimile is borrowed from the Neapolitan volumes, but Plate 57\r\n      in the Paléographie Universelle φιλοδημου περι μουσικη has the\r\n      advantage of _colours_ for giving a lively idea of the present\r\n      charred appearance of these papyri.\r\n\r\n   31 Cicero de Finibus, Lib. ii. c. 35. The same person is apparently\r\n      meant in Orat. in Pisonem, cc. 28, 29.\r\n\r\n   32 We prefer citing Cod. Frid.-August., because our examples have been\r\n      actually taken from its exquisitely lithographed pages; but the\r\n      facsimile of part of a page from Luke xxiv represented in\r\n      Tischendorf’s Cod. Sinaiticus, from which we have borrowed six lines\r\n      (No. 11 b), will be seen to resemble exactly the portion published\r\n      in 1846.\r\n\r\n   33 Cod. A is found in the simpler form in the Old Testament, but mostly\r\n      with the horizontal line produced in the New.\r\n\r\n   34 See Maunde Thompson’s “Greek and Latin Palaeography.”\r\n\r\n   35 Codd. B of Apocalypse, Θa Λ (No. 30) of the Gospels, and Silvestre’s\r\n      No. 68, all of about the eighth century, slope more or less to the\r\n      right; Cod. Γ (No. 35) of the ninth century, a very little to the\r\n      left. Tischendorf assigns to the seventh century the fragments\r\n      comprising Leipzig II. (see p. 39), though they lean much to the\r\n      right (Monum. sacra ined. tom. i, pp. xxx-xxxiv, 141-176), and those\r\n      of Isaiah (ibid. pp. xxxvi, xxxvii, 187-199).\r\n\r\n   36 The earliest cursive Biblical manuscript formerly alleged, i.e.\r\n      Evan. 14, on examination proves to have no inscription whatever. “On\r\n      folio 392, in a comparatively modern hand, is rather uncouthly\r\n      written ἐγράφη νικηφόρου βασιλεύοντος A. Z. What the initials A. Z.\r\n      stand for I do not know.” (Dean Burgon, Guardian, Jan. 15, 1873.)\r\n      The claim of priority for Cod. 14 being thus disposed of (though it\r\n      must be noted that Dr. C. R. Gregory refers it without doubt to the\r\n      tenth century), we may note that Cod. 429 of the Gospels is dated\r\n      978, Cod. 148 of the Acts 984, Cod. 5pe 994, and Λ, written partly\r\n      in cursives, and partly in uncials is of the ninth century. But the\r\n      date May 7, 835 A.D. is plainly visible on Cod. 481, which is\r\n      therefore indisputably the earliest.\r\n\r\n   37 See Maunde Thompson, Greek and Latin Palaeology, chap. x. pp. 130,\r\n      &c., and chap. viii. pp. 107, &c; Notices et Extracts des MSS. de la\r\n      Bibliothèque Imperiale, Paris, plate xxiv. no. 21, pl. xlviii. no.\r\n      21 _ter_, xlvi. no. 69, _e_, xxi. no. 17, xiii. no. 5, xl. no. 62,\r\n      xviii. 2, pl. xliv; Cat.

It\r\n      should be stated that these very curious books, both written by\r\n      monks, and indeed _all the dated manuscripts of the Greek Testament\r\n      we have seen_ except Canonici 34 in the Bodleian (which reckons from\r\n      the Christian era, A.D. 1515-6), calculate from the Greek era of the\r\n      Creation, September 1, B.C. 5508. To obtain the year A.D.,\r\n      therefore, from January 1 to August 31 in any year, subtract 5508\r\n      from the given year; from September 1 to December 31 subtract 5509.\r\n      The indiction which usually accompanies this date is a useful check\r\n      in case of any corruption or want of legibility in the letters\r\n      employed as numerals. Both dates are given in Evan. 558, viz. A.M.\r\n      6938, and A.D. 1430.\r\n\r\n   39 The writer of Burney 21 (rscr) A.D. 1292 (Evan. 571), ὁ ταπεινος\r\n      Θεοδωρος ἁγιωπετριτης ταχα και καλλιγραφος as he calls himself (that\r\n      is, as I once supposed, monk of the Convent of Sancta Petra at\r\n      Constantinople, short-hand and fair writer), was the scribe of at\r\n      least _five_ more copies of Scripture now extant: Birch’s Havn. 1,\r\n      A.D. 1278 (Evan. 234); Evan. 90, A.D. 1293; Evan. 543, A.D. 1295;\r\n      Scholz’s Evan. 412, A.D. 1301; Evan. 74, _undated_. To this list\r\n      Franz Delitzsch (1813-1890) (Zeitschr. f. luth. Theol. 1863, ii,\r\n      Abhandlungen, pp. 217, 218) adds from Matthaei, Synaxarion in Mosc.\r\n      Syn. Typograph. xxvi. A.D. 1295, and recognizes _Hagios Petros_, the\r\n      country of Theodoros, as a town in the Morea, on the borders of\r\n      Arcadia, from whose school students have attended his own lectures\r\n      at Erlangen.\r\n\r\n   40 Hence in the later uncials, some of which must therefore have been\r\n      copied from earlier cursives, Β and Υ (which might seem to have no\r\n      resemblance) are sometimes confounded: e.g. in Parham 18 (A.D. 980),\r\n      υ for β, Luke vi. 34; β for υ, John x. 1, especially where β begins\r\n      or ends a line: e.g. Evan. 59, John vii. 35. Evan. 59 has β for υ\r\n      very often, yet there is no extra trace that it was copied from an\r\n      uncial.\r\n\r\n   41 The full signature not easily deciphered is ἐτελειώθη τὸ παρὸν ἅγιον\r\n      εὐαγγέλιον κατὰ τὴν _κ_ζ τοῦ ἰαννουαρίου μηνὸς τῆς [?] _ω_ _κ_ ζ\r\n      ἐγχρονίας. Presuming that _ς_ is suppressed before _ω_ _κ_ ζ this is\r\n      6827 of the Greeks, A.D. 1319.\r\n\r\n   42 Compare also Buttmann’s Greek Grammar (Robinson’s translation) p.\r\n      467; Bast in (Schaefer’s Gregorius Corinthius) tabb. ad fin.;\r\n      Gardthausen, Palaeographie, p. 248, &c.\r\n\r\n   43 Thus the type cast for the Royal Printing Office at Paris, and used\r\n      by Robert Stephen, is said to have been modelled on the style of the\r\n      calligrapher Angelus Vergecius, from whose skill arose the\r\n      expression “he writes like an angel.” Codd. 296 of the Gospels, 124\r\n      of the Acts, 151 of St. Paul are in his hand.\r\n\r\n   44 Yet Tischendorf (N. T. 1859, Proleg. p. cxxxiii) cites ηιδισαν from\r\n      Cod. Bezae (Mark i. 34), ξυλωι (Luke xxiii. 31) from Cod. Cyprius,\r\n      ωι from Cod. U (Matt. xxv. 15) and Cod. Λ (Luke vii. 4). Add Cod.\r\n      Bezae πατρωιου Acts xxii. 3, Scrivener’s edition, Introd. p. xix.\r\n      Bentley’s nephew speaks of ι _ascript_ as in the first hand of Cod.\r\n      B, but he seems to have been mistaken.\r\n\r\n   45 In B-C iii. 10 (_dated_ 1430), the whole manuscript being written by\r\n      the same hand, we have ι _ascript_ twenty-five times up to Luke i.\r\n      75, then on the same page ι _subscript_ in Luke i. 77 and\r\n      eighty-five times afterwards: the two usages are nowhere mixed. In\r\n      Evan. 558, _subscript_ and _ascript_ are mixed in the same page,\r\n      Luc. i. 75, 77.\r\n\r\n   46 The invention of breathings, accents, and stops is attributed to\r\n      Aristophanes of Byzantium, 260 B.C.\r\n\r\n   47 See below vol. ii. c. ix. 9. note, end. Dr. Scrivener appears not to\r\n      have formed a positive opinion, which indeed in some of these cases\r\n      is hardly possible.\r\n\r\n   48 He is speaking (Quaestion. super Genes. clxii) of the difference\r\n      between ῥάβδου αὐτοῦ and ῥάβδου αὑτοῦ, Gen. xlvii. 31. “Fallit enim\r\n      eos verbum Graecum, quod eisdem literis scribitur, sive _ejus_, sive\r\n      _suae_: sed accentus [he must mean the breathings] dispares sunt, et\r\n      ab eis, qui ista noverunt, in codicibus non contemnuntur” (Opera,\r\n      Tom. iv. p. 53, ed. 1586, Lugdun.); adding that “suae” _might_ be\r\n      expressed by ἑαυτοῦ.\r\n\r\n   49 In the Gale Evangelistarium (Trin. Coll. Camb. O. 4. 22) the\r\n      interrogative clause is set between two such marks in red. Hence it\r\n      seems not so much a stop as a vocal note. In the Armenian and\r\n      Spanish languages the note of interrogation is set before the\r\n      interrogative clause, and very conveniently too.\r\n\r\n   50 The earliest known example of the use of two dots occurs in the\r\n      Artemisia papyrus at Vienna (Maunde Thompson, p. 69), and other\r\n      early instances are found in a letter of Dionysius to Ptolemy about\r\n      B.C. 160, published by the French Institute, 1865, in “Papyrus grecs\r\n      du Musée du Louvre,” &c. tom. xviii. 2e ptie, pl. xxxiv, pap. 49,\r\n      and in fragments of the Phaedo of Plato discovered at Gurob. The\r\n      same double points are also occasionally set in the larger spaces of\r\n      Codd. Sinaiticus, Sarravianus, and Bezae, but in the last-named copy\r\n      for the most part in a later hand.\r\n\r\n   51 Abbot, ubi supra.\r\n\r\n   52 Hoskier, Cod. 604, p. xiii.\r\n\r\n   53 Even Codex Sinaiticus has _ιηυ_ and _ιυ_ in consecutive lines (Apoc.\r\n      xxii. 20, 21), and _χρυ_ Rom. vii. 4.\r\n\r\n   54 See below p. 64, note 4.\r\n\r\n   55 “Fragmenta pauca evangelii Johannis palimpsesta Londinensia [Evan.\r\n      Ib or Nb]. In ceteris haec fere tria: Dionis Cassii fragmenta\r\n      Vaticana—vix enim qui in his videntur speciem majorum litterarum\r\n      habere revera differunt—item fragmenta palimpsesta [Phaëthontis]\r\n      Euripidis Claromontana et fragmenta Menandri Porphiriana”\r\n      (Tischendorf, Cod. Vatic. Proleg. p. xviii, 1867).\r\n\r\n   56 The English word _paragraph_ is derived from the παραγραφαί, which\r\n      are often straight lines, placed in the margin to indicate a pause\r\n      in the sense. Professor Abbot, ubi supra, p. 195, alleges not a few\r\n      instances where these dashes are thus employed. A specimen is given\r\n      in Scrivener’s Cod. Sinaiticus, facsimile 3: see his Cod. Sin.,\r\n      Introduction, p. xl and note. Thus also they appear in Cod.\r\n      Sarravianus (Tischendorf, Mon. sacra ined. vol. iii. pp. xiv, xx).\r\n      In Cod Bezae [symbol] is set in the margin forty-nine times by a\r\n      later hand, and must be designed for the same purpose, though the\r\n      mark sometimes occurs where we should hardly look for it (Scrivener,\r\n      Cod. Bezae, Introduction, p. xxviii and note). In Cod. Marchalianus\r\n      the dash stands over the capital at the beginning of a line, or over\r\n      the first letter where there is no capital. Lastly, in Codd. Vatic.\r\n      and Sinait. [symbol] is sometimes set in the middle of a line to\r\n      indicate a paragraph break, followed by [symbol] in the margin of\r\n      the next line.\r\n\r\n   57 Many other examples of the use of στίχοι and _versus_ in this sense\r\n      will be found in that admirable monument of exact learning, now so\r\n      little read, Prideaux Connections, An. 446. Stichometry can be\r\n      traced back to nearly a century before Callimachus, who (B.C. 260)\r\n      has been credited with the invention (Palaeography, p. 79). The term\r\n      στίχοι, like the Latin _versus_, originally referring whether to\r\n      rows of trees, or to the oars in the trireme (Virg. Aen. v. 119),\r\n      would naturally come to be applied to lines of poetry, and in this\r\n      sense it is used by Pindar (ἐπέων στίχες Pyth. iv. 100) and also by\r\n      Theocritus (γράψον καὶ τόδε γράμμα, τό σοι στίχοισι χαράξω Idyl,\r\n      xxiii. 46), if the common reading be correct.\r\n\r\n   58 That we have rightly understood Epiphanius’ notion of the στίχοι is\r\n      evident from his own language respecting Psalm cxli. 1, wherein he\r\n      prefers the addition made by the Septuagint to the second clause,\r\n      because by so doing its authors ἀχώλωτον ἐποίησαν τὸν στίχον: so\r\n      that the passage should run “O Lord, I cry unto Thee, make haste\r\n      unto me || Give ear to the voice of my request,” τῆς δεήσεώς μου to\r\n      complete the rhythm. This whole subject is admirably worked out in\r\n      Suicer, Thesaur. Eccles. tom. ii. pp. 1025-37.\r\n\r\n   59 In the Epistles of St. Paul, Euthalius seems to have followed a\r\n      Syrian writer. Gregory, Prolegomena, p. 113; Zacagnius, Collectanea\r\n      Monumentorum Veterum Ecclesiae, Rome, A.D. 1698, pp. 404, 409.\r\n\r\n   60 At the end of 2 Thess., in a hand which Tischendorf states to be\r\n      very ancient, but not that of the original scribe, the Codex\r\n      Sinaiticus has στιχων ρπ [180; the usual number is 106]: at the end\r\n      of Rom., 1 Cor., 1 Thess., and the Catholic Epistles, there is no\r\n      such note; but in all the other Pauline Epistles the στίχοι are\r\n      numbered.\r\n\r\n   61 So the margin of Gale’s Evan. 66 contains readings cited by Mill and\r\n      his followers, which a hand of the sixteenth century took, some of\r\n      them from the Leicester manuscript, others from early editions.\r\n\r\n   62 The following subscription to the book of Ezra (and a very similar\r\n      one follows Esther) in the Cod. Frid.-August, (fol. 13. 1), though\r\n      in a hand of the seventh century, will show the care bestowed on the\r\n      most ancient copies of the Septuagint: Αντεβληθη προσ παλαιωτατον\r\n      λιαν αντιγραφον δεδιορθωμενον χειρι του αγιου μαρτυροσ Παμφιλου;\r\n      ὁπερ αντιγραφον προσ τω τελει υποσημειωσισ τισ ϊδιοχειροσ αυτου\r\n      ϋπεκειτο εχουσα ουτωσ; μετελημφθη και διορθωθη προσ τα εξαπλα\r\n      ωριγενουσ; Αντωνινοσ αντεβαλεν; Παμφιλοσ διορθωσα. Tregelles\r\n      suggests that the work of the διορθωτὴς or _corrector_ was probably\r\n      of a critical character, the office of the ἀντιβάλλων or _comparer_\r\n      being rather to eliminate mere clerical errors (Treg. Horne’s\r\n      Introd., vol. iv. p. 85). Compare Tischendorf, Cod. Sinait. Proleg.\r\n      p. xxii.\r\n\r\n   63 “Simile aliquid invenitur in codice Arabico epp. Pauli anno 892, p.\r\n      Chr., quem ex oriente Petropolin pertulimus.” Tischendorf, Cod. Vat.\r\n      Prolog. p. xxx. n. 3.\r\n\r\n   64 Lat. _breves_, or τίτλοι: but τίτλος means properly the brief\r\n      summary of the contents of a κεφάλαιον placed at the top or bottom\r\n      of a page, or with the κεφάλαια in a table to each Gospel. The κεφ.\r\n      _minora_ = Ammonian Sections.\r\n\r\n   65 This full explanation of a seeming difficulty was communicated to me\r\n      independently by Mr. P. W. Pennefather of Dublin, and Mr. G. A. King\r\n      of Oxford.\r\n\r\n   66 And this too in spite of the lexicographer Suidas: Τίτλος διαφέρει\r\n      κεφαλαίου; καὶ ὁ Ματθαῖος τίτλους ἔχει ξή, κεφάλαια δὲ τνέ. And of\r\n      Suicer, s. v.\r\n\r\n   67 Ὁ Τατιανός, συνάφειάν τινα καὶ συναγωγὴν οὐκ οἶδ᾽ ὅπως τῶν\r\n      εὐαγγελίων συνθείς, τὸ διὰ τεσσάρων τοῦτο προσωνόμασεν; ὃ καὶ παρά\r\n      τισιν εἰσέτι νῦν φέρεται. Euseb. Hist. Eccl. iv. 29.\r\n\r\n   68 Ambros. in Prooem. Luc. seems to aim at Tatian when he says\r\n      “Plerique etiam ex quatuor Evangelii libris in unum ea quae\r\n      venenatis putaverunt assertionibus convenientia referserunt.”\r\n      Eusebius H. E. iv. 29 charges him on report with _improving_ not the\r\n      Gospels, but the Epistles: τοῦ δὲ ἀποστόλου φασὶ τολμῆσαί τινας\r\n      αὐτὸν μεταφράσαι φωνάς, ὡς ἐπιδιορφούμενον αὐτῶν τὴν τῆς φράσεως\r\n      σύνταξιν. Dr. Westcott’s verdict is rather less favourable than\r\n      might have been anticipated: “The heretical character of the\r\n      Diatessaron was not evident on the surface of it, and consisted\r\n      rather of faults of defect than of erroneous teaching” (History of\r\n      the Canon, p. 354). From the Armenian version of Ephraem the\r\n      Syrian’s Exposition of Tatian’s Harmony, printed in 1836, translated\r\n      in 1841 by Aucher of the Melchitarist Monastery at Venice, but\r\n      buried until it was published with notes by Moesinger in 1876, a\r\n      flood of light is thrown upon this question, and it is now clear\r\n      “that Tatian habitually abridged the language of the passages which\r\n      he combined” (Hort, Gk. Test. Introduction, p. 283); and that\r\n      apparently in perfect good faith.\r\n\r\n   69 Ἀμμώνιος μὲν ὁ Ἀλεξανδρεύς, πολλήν, ὡς εἰκός, φιλοπονίαν καὶ σπουδὴν\r\n      εἰσαγηοχώς, τὸ διὰ τεσσάρων ἡμῖν καταλέλοιπεν εὐαγγέλιον, τῷ κατὰ\r\n      Ματθαῖον τὰς ὁμοφώνους τῶν λοιπῶν εὐαγγελιστῶν περικοπὰς παραθείς,\r\n      ὡς ἐξ ἀνάγκης συμβῆναι τὸν τῆς ἀκολουθίας εἱρμὸν τῶν τριῶν\r\n      διαφθαρῆναι, ὅσον ἐπὶ τῷ ὕφει τῆς ἀναγνώσεως.

I have thankfully availed myself on this subject of\r\n      Burgon’s elaborate studies in The Last Twelve Verses of St. Mark,\r\n      pp. 125-132; 295-312.\r\n\r\n   70 This is the number given for St. Mark by Suidas and Stephen. It is\r\n      an uncertain point: thirty-four manuscripts give 233, reckoning only\r\n      to xvi. 8; while thirty-six give 341. See Burgon Twelve Last Verses,\r\n      p. 311.\r\n\r\n   71 I subjoin Eusebius’ own words (Epist. ad Carpian.) from which no one\r\n      would infer that the _sections_ were not his, as well as the\r\n      _canons_. Αὕτη μὲν οὖν ἡ τῶν ὑποτεταγμένων κανόνων ὑπόθεσις; ἡ δὲ\r\n      σαφὴς αὐτῶν διήγησις, ἔστιν ἤδε. Ἐφ᾽ ἑκάστῳ τῶν τεσσάρων εὐαγγελίων\r\n      ἀριθμός τις πρόκειται κατὰ μέρος, ἀρχόμενος ἀπὸ τοῦ πρώτου, εἶτα\r\n      δευτέρου, καὶ τρίτου, καὶ καθεξῆς προϊὼν δι᾽ ὅλου μέχρι τοῦ τέλους\r\n      τοῦ βιβλίου [the sections]. Καθ᾽ ἕκαστον δὲ ἀριθμὸν ὑποσημείωσις διὰ\r\n      κινναβάρεως πρόκειται [the canons], δηλοῦσα ἐν ποίῳ τῶν δέκα κανόνων\r\n      κείμενος ὁ ἀριθμὸς τυγχάνει.\r\n\r\n   72 Something of this kind, however, must be the plan adopted in Codex E\r\n      (see Plate xi. No. 27) of the Gospels, as described by Tregelles,\r\n      who himself collated it. “[It has] the Ammonian sections; but\r\n      instead of the Eusebian canons there is a kind of harmony of the\r\n      Gospels noted at the foot of each page, by a reference to the\r\n      parallel sections of the other Evangelists.” Horne’s Introd. vol.\r\n      iv. p. 200. Yet the canons _also_ stand in the margin of this copy\r\n      under the so-called Ammonian sections: only the _table_ of Eusebian\r\n      canons is wanting. The same kind of harmony at the foot of the page\r\n      appears in Cod. Wd at Trinity College, Cambridge, but in this latter\r\n      the sections in the margin are not accompanied by the canons.\r\n      Tischendorf states that the same arrangement prevails in the small\r\n      fragment Tb at St. Petersburg; Dean Burgon adds to the list Codd. M.\r\n      262, 264 at Paris, and conceives that this method of harmonizing,\r\n      which he regards as far simpler than the tedious and cumbersome\r\n      process of resorting to the Eusebian canons (ubi supra, p. 304), was\r\n      in principle, though not in details, derived to the Greek Church\r\n      from early Syriac copies of the Gospels, some of which still survive\r\n      (p. 306).\r\n\r\n   73 To this list of manuscripts of the Gospels which have the Ammonian\r\n      sections without the Eusebian canons add Codd. 38, 54, 60, 68, 117;\r\n      Brit. Mus. Addit. 16184, 18211, 19389; Milan Ambros. M. 48 _sup._;\r\n      E. 63 _sup._; Burdett-Coutts I. 4; II. 18; 262; III. 9. Now that\r\n      attention has been specially directed to the matter, it is\r\n      remarkable how many copies have the Ammonian sections without the\r\n      corresponding Eusebian canons under them, sometimes even when (as in\r\n      Codd. 572, 595, 597) the letter to Carpianus and the Eusebian tables\r\n      stand at the beginning of the volume. To the list here given must\r\n      now be added Codd. O, Υ, 185, 187, 190, 193, 194, 207, 209, 214,\r\n      217, 367, 406, 409, 410, 414, 418, 419, 456, 457, 494, 497, 501,\r\n      503, 504, 506, 508, 518, 544, 548, 550, 555, 558, 559, 564, 573,\r\n      575, 584, 586, 591, 592, 601, 602, 620: in all seventy-one\r\n      manuscripts.\r\n\r\n   74 No doubt they do serve, in the manuscripts which contain them and\r\n      omit the canons, for marks of reference, like in kind to our modern\r\n      chapters and verses; but in consequence of their having been\r\n      constructed for a wholly different purpose, they are so unequal in\r\n      length (as Burgon sees very clearly, pp. 297, 303), that they answer\r\n      that end as ill as any the most arbitrary divisions of the text well\r\n      could do.\r\n\r\n   75 Sulci in Sardinia is the only Bishop’s see of the name I can find in\r\n      Carol. a Sancto Paulo’s Geographia Sacra (1703), or in Bingham’s\r\n      Antiquities, Bk. ix. Chapp. II, VII. Horne and even Tregelles speak\r\n      of Sulca in Egypt, but I have searched in vain for any such town or\r\n      see. Euthalius is called Bishop of Sulce both in Wake 12 (infra,\r\n      note 4), and in the title to his works as edited by L. A. Zacagni\r\n      (Collectanea Monument. Veter. Eccles. Graec. ac Latin., Rom. 1698,\r\n      p. 402). But one of Zacagni’s manuscripts reads Σούλκης once, and he\r\n      guesses Ψέλχη near Syene, which appears in no list of Episcopal\r\n      sees.\r\n\r\n   76 Καθ᾽ ἑκάστην ἐπιστολὴν προτάξομεν τὴν τῶν κεφαλαίων ἔκθεσιν, ἑνὶ τῶν\r\n      σοφωτάτων τινὶ καὶ φιλοχρίστων πατέρων ἡμῶν πεπονημένην.\r\n\r\n   77 Αὐτίκα δῆτα is his own expression.\r\n\r\n   78 E.g. in Wake 12, of the eleventh century, at Christ Church, the\r\n      title at the head of the list of chapters in the Acts is as follows:\r\n      Εὐθαλίου ἐπισκόπου Σουλκῆς ἔκθεσις κεφαλαίων τῶν Πράξεων σταλῆσα\r\n      (-εῖσα) πρὸς Ἀθανάσιον ἐπίσκοπον Ἀλεξανδρείας.\r\n\r\n   79 In Wake 12 certain of the longer κεφάλαια are subdivided into\r\n      μερικαὶ ὑποδιαιρέσεις in the Acts, 1 Peter, 1 John, Romans, 1, 2\r\n      Corinthians, Colossians, 2 Thessalonians, 1 Timothy, Hebrews only.\r\n      For a similar subdivision in the Gospels, see Evan. 443 in the list\r\n      of cursive MSS. given below.\r\n\r\n   80 Διὰ τὴν τριμερῆ τῶν εἴκοσι τεσσάρων πρεσβυτέρων ὑπόστασιν, σώματος\r\n      καὶ ψυχῆς καὶ πνεύματος. See Matthaei, N. T. Gr. et Lat. vii. 276,\r\n      note 4.\r\n\r\n   81 Many manuscripts indicate passages of the Old Testament cited in the\r\n      New by placing > (as in Codd. Vatican. Wd, &c., but in Sinait. more\r\n      rarely), or [symbol with two greater-than marks], or some such mark\r\n      in the margin before every line. Our quotation-marks are probably\r\n      derived from this sign, the angle being rounded into a curve.\r\n      Compare the use of [symbol like right double quotation mark] in the\r\n      margin of the Greek Testament of Colinaeus, 1534, and Stephen’s\r\n      editions of 1546, -49, -50, &c. Evan. 348 and others have [symbol].\r\n      In Codd. Bezae, as will appear hereafter, the words cited are merely\r\n      thrown a letter or two back in each line.\r\n\r\n   82 The whole mystery is thus unfolded (apparently by Cosmas) in Lamb.\r\n      1178, p. 159: Καὶ γὰρ τὰ χερουβὶμ τετραπρόσωπα; καὶ τὰ πρόσωπα αὐτῶν\r\n      εἰκόνες τῆς πραγματείας τοῦ υἱοῦ τοῦ Θεοῦ; τὸ γὰρ ὅμοιον λέοντι, τὸ\r\n      ἔμπρακτον καὶ βασιλικὸν καὶ ἡγεμονικὸν [John i. 1-3] χαρακτηρίζει;\r\n      τὸ δὲ ὅμοιον μόσχωι, τὴν ἱερουργικὴν καὶ ἱερατικὴν [Luke i. 8]\r\n      ἐμφανίζει; τὸ δὲ ἀνθρωποειδές, τὴν σάρκωσιν [Matt. i. 18] διαγράφει.\r\n      τὸ δὲ ὅμοιον ἀετῶι, τὴν ἐπιφοίτησιν τοῦ ἁγίου πνεύματος [Mark i. 2]\r\n      ἐμφανίζει. More usually the lion is regarded as the emblem of St.\r\n      Mark, the eagle of St. John.\r\n\r\n   83 N. B. The στίχοι of the Acts and of all the Epistles except Hebr.\r\n      are taken from the Codex Passionei (G or L), an uncial of the ninth\r\n      century.\r\n\r\n   84 The numbers of the Gospel στίχοι in our Table are taken from the\r\n      uncial copies Codd. GS and twenty-seven cursives named by Scholz:\r\n      those of the ῥήματα from Codd. 9, 13, 124 and seven others. In the\r\n      ῥήματα he cites no other variation than that Cod. 339 has 2822 for\r\n      St. Matthew: but Mill states that Cod. 48 (Bodl. 7) has 1676 for\r\n      Mark, 2507 for Luke (Proleg. N. T. § 1429). In Cod. 56 (Lincoln\r\n      Coll.) the ἀναγνώσματα of St. Matthew are 127, of St. Mark 74, of\r\n      St. Luke 130 (Mill).\r\n\r\n      In the στίχοι, a few straggling manuscripts fluctuate between 3897?\r\n      and 1474 for Matthew; 2006 and 1000 for Mark; 3827 and 2000 for\r\n      Luke; 2300 and 1300 for John. But the great mass of authorities\r\n      stand as we have represented.\r\n\r\n   85 Our English version divides 2 Cor. xiii. 12 of the Greek into two,\r\n      and unites John i. 38, 39 of the Greek. The English and Greek verses\r\n      begin differently in Luke i. 73, 74; vii. 18, 19. Acts ix. 28, 29;\r\n      xi. 25, 26; xiii. 32, 33; xix. 40, 41; xxiv. 2, 3. 2 Cor. ii. 12,\r\n      13; v. 14, 15; xi. 8, 9. Eph. i. 10, 11; iii. 17, 18. Phil. iii. 13,\r\n      14. 1 Thess. ii. 11, 12. Heb. vii. 20, 21; x. 22, 23. 1 Jo. ii.\r\n      13,14. 3 Jo. 14, 15. Apoc. xii. 18 or xiii. 1; xviii. 16, 17. In a\r\n      few of these places editions of the Greek vary a little. The whole\r\n      subject of the verses is discussed in Dr. Ezra Abbot’s tract “De\r\n      Editionibus Novi Testamenti Graece in versuum quos dicunt\r\n      distinctione inter se discrepantibus” 1882, included in the\r\n      Prolegomena for Tischendorf’s N. T., eighth edition, pp. 167, &c.\r\n\r\n   86 “I think it would have been better done on one’s knees in the\r\n      closet,” is Mr. Kelly’s quaint and not unfair comment (Lectures on\r\n      the Minor Prophets, p. 324), unless, as is not unlikely, he copied\r\n      what was done before.\r\n\r\n   87 Novum Testamentum Graecum. Edente Jo. Alberto Bengelio. Tubingae\r\n      1734. 4to. The practice of the oldest Greek manuscripts in regard to\r\n      paragraphs has been stated above (p. 49, note 2), and will be\r\n      further explained in the next section under our descriptions of\r\n      Codd. אBD.\r\n\r\n   88 Coislin. 199 (Evan. 85); Vatic. 2080 (Evan. 175); Palat. Vat. 171\r\n      (Evan. 149); Lambec. 1 at Vienna (Evan. 218); Vatic. 1160 (Evan.\r\n      141); Venet. 5 (Evan. 205); its alleged duplicate Venet. 10 (Evan.\r\n      209); Matthaei k (Evan. 241); Moscow Synod. 380 (Evan. 242); Paris,\r\n      Reg. 47 (Evan. 18); Reg. 61 (Evan. 263); Vat. Ottob. 66 (Evan. 386);\r\n      Vat. Ottob. 381 (Evan. 390); Taurin. 302 (Evan. 339); S. Saba, 10\r\n      and 20 (Evan. 462 and 466); Laurent. 53 (Evan. 367); Vallicel. F. 17\r\n      (Evan. 394); Phillipps 7682 (Evan. 531); perhaps Scholz ought to\r\n      have added Venet. 6 (Evan. 206) which he states to contain the whole\r\n      New Testament, Proleg. N. T. vol. i. p. lxxii. In Evan. 180 all\r\n      except the Gospels are by a later hand. Add (Evan. 622) also copies\r\n      at Poictiers, Ferrara, and Toledo. Lagarde (Genesis, pp. 7, 8)\r\n      describes another copy at Zittau, collated by Matthaei in 1801-2,\r\n      apparently unpublished.\r\n\r\n   89 I presume that the same order is found in Evan. 393, whereof Scholz\r\n      states “sec. xvi. continet epist. cath. paul. ev.” Proleg. N. T.\r\n      vol. i. p. xc.\r\n\r\n   90 Hartwell Horne in the second volume of his Introduction tells us\r\n      that in some of the few manuscripts which contain the whole of the\r\n      New Testament the books are arranged thus: Gospels, Acts, Catholic\r\n      Epistles, Apocalypse, Pauline Epistles (p. 92, ed. 1834). This\r\n      statement may be true of some of the foreign MSS. named in p. 69\r\n      note, but of the English it can refer to none, although Wake 34 at\r\n      Christ Church commences with the Acts and Catholic Epistles,\r\n      followed by the Apocalypse beginning on the same page as Jude ends,\r\n      and the Pauline Epistles on the same page as the Apocalypse ends.\r\n      The Gospels, which come last, may have been misplaced by an early\r\n      binder.\r\n\r\n   91 This is the true _Western_ order (Scrivener, Cod. Bezae, Introd. p.\r\n      xxx and note), and will be found in the copies of the Old Latin\r\n      _a_1, _a_2, _b_, _e_, _f_1, _ff_2, _i_, _n_, _g_, _r_ to be\r\n      described in vol. ii, and in the Gothic version. In Burdett-Coutts\r\n      II. 7, p. 4, also, prefixed to the Gospels, we read the following\r\n      rubric-title to certain verses of Gregory Nazianzen: _χυ_ θαύματα;\r\n      παρὰ ματθαίω ῒωάννῃ τὲ καὶ λουκᾶ καὶ μάρκω; κ.τ.λ.\r\n\r\n   92 Tischendorf cites the following copies in which the Epistle to the\r\n      Hebrews stands in the same order as in Codd. אABC, “H [Coislin.\r\n      202], 17, 23, 47, 57, 71, 73 aliique.” Add 77, 80, 166, 189, 196,\r\n      264, 265, 266 (Burdett-Coutts II. 4). So in Zoega’s Thebaic version.\r\n      Epiphanius (adv. Haer. i. 42) says: ἄλλα δὲ ἀντίγραφα ἔχει τὴν πρὸς\r\n      ἑβραίους δεκάτην, πρὸ τῶν δύο τῶν πρὸς Τιμόθεον καὶ Τίτον. So Paul\r\n      166, 281, and also Bp. Lightfoot’s MSS. of the Memphitic except 7\r\n      and 16. In the Thebaic it follows 2 Cor. See below.\r\n\r\n   93 They are also termed Εὐαγγέλια—evidently a popular, as well as a\r\n      misleading name.\r\n\r\n   94 Suicer, s. v.\r\n\r\n   95 This was the word for a lection or lesson, and Suicer tells us that\r\n      ἀνάγνωσις and ἀνάγνωσμα were employed as equivalents. But in modern\r\n      textual criticism, ἀναγνώσματα is used to signify the marks\r\n      indicating lections, which are found in the margin or at the head or\r\n      foot of pages, or the computation of their number which is often\r\n      appended at the end of a book. See pp. 67, note 1, 69.\r\n\r\n   96 Chrysost. in Joan. Hom. x κατὰ μίαν σαββάτων ἢ καὶ κατὰ σάββατον.\r\n      Traces of these Church-lessons occur in manuscripts as early as the\r\n      fifth and sixth centuries. Thus Cod. Alexandrinus reads Rom. xvi.\r\n      25-27 not only in its proper place, but also at the end of ch. xiv\r\n      where the Lectionaries place it (see p. 84). Codex Bezae prefixes to\r\n      Luke xvi. 19 εἶπεν δὲ καὶ ἐτέραν παραβολήν, the proper introduction\r\n      to the Gospel for the 5th Sunday in St. Luke. To John xiv. 1 the\r\n      same manuscript prefixes καὶ εἶπεν τοῖς μαθηταῖς αὐτοῦ, as does our\r\n      English Prayer Book in the Gospel for May 1. Even τέλος or τὸ τέλος,\r\n      which follows ἀπέχει in Mark xiv. 41 in the same manuscript and\r\n      other authorities, probably has the same origin.\r\n\r\n   97 See the passages from Augustine Tract. VI. in Joan.; and Chrysost.\r\n      Hom. VII ad Antioch.; Hom. LXIII, XLVII in Act. in Bingham’s\r\n      Antiquities, Book XIV, Chap. III. Sect. 3. Chrysostom even calls the\r\n      arrangement τῶν πατέρων ὁ νόμος. The strong passage cited from Cyril\r\n      of Jerusalem by Dean Burgon (Last Twelve Verses of St. Mark, p. 195)\r\n      shows the confirmed practice as already settled in A.D. 348.\r\n\r\n   98 August. Serm. CXLIII de Tempore. The few verses Luke xxiii. 39-43,\r\n      John xix. 31-37 are merely wrought into one narrative with Matt.\r\n      xxvii, each in its proper place. See p. 85.\r\n\r\n   99 Besides this special meaning, Synaxarion was also employed in a\r\n      general sense for any catalogue of Church-lessons, both for daily\r\n      use and for Saints’ days.\r\n\r\n  100 This was naturally even more the case in countries where the Liturgy\r\n      was not in Greek. Thus in the “Calendar of the Coptic Church”\r\n      translated from the Arabic by Dr. S. C. Malan (1873), the only\r\n      Feast-days identical with those given below (pp. 87-89) are Sept.\r\n      14; Oct. 8; Nov. 8, 13, 14, 17, 25, 30; Dec. 20, 24, 25, 29; Jan. 1,\r\n      6 (the Lord’s Baptism), 22; Feb. 2, 24; March 25; April 25; May 2;\r\n      June 19, 24, 29; July 22; Aug. 6, 25. Elsewhere the day is altered,\r\n      even if the festival be the same; e.g. St. Thomas’ Day is Oct. 6\r\n      with the Greeks, Oct. 23 with the Copts; St. Luke’s Day (Oct. 18),\r\n      and the Beheading of the Baptist (Aug. 29), are kept by the Copts a\r\n      day later than by the Greeks, since Aug. 29 is their New Year’s Day.\r\n\r\n  101 This system was introduced by Wetstein (N. T. 1751-52). Mill used to\r\n      cite copies by abridgements of their names, e.g. Alex. Cant. Mont.\r\n      &c.\r\n\r\n  102 The _pericope adulterae_ John vii. 53-viii. 11 is omitted in all the\r\n      copies we know on the feast of Pentecost. Whenever read it was on\r\n      some Saint’s Day (_vid. infra_, p. 87, _notes_ 2, 3).\r\n\r\n  103 Lessons for the week in B-C. III. 24 are (2) 2 Cor. iii. 4-12. (3)\r\n      iv. 1-6. (4) 11-18. (5) v. 10-15. (6) 15-21.\r\n\r\n  104 In B-C. III. 42 all the Gospels for this day run into each other\r\n      without break, e.g. John xiii. 3-17 being read _uno tenore_. Just so\r\n      in the same manuscript stands the mixed lesson for Good Friday\r\n      evening.\r\n\r\n  105 The more usual indiction, which dates from Sept. 1, is manifestly\r\n      excluded by the following rubric (Burney, 22, p. 191, and in other\r\n      copies): Δέοό γινώσκζιν ὅτι ἄρχδται ὁ Λουκᾶς ἀναγινώσκεσθαι ἀπὸ τῆς\r\n      Κυριακῆς μετὰ τὴν ὕψωσιν; τότε γὰρ καὶ ἡ ἰσυμερία [i.e. ἰσημερία]\r\n      γίνεται, ὃ καλεῖται νέον ἔτος. Ἤ ὅτι ἀπὸ τὰς [τῆς] κγ´ τοῦ\r\n      σεπτευβρίου ὁ Λουκᾶς ἀναγινώσκεσαι.\r\n\r\n  106 The lesson for the Sunday after Sept. 14 is the same as that for the\r\n      3rd Sunday in Lent.\r\n\r\n  107 The ordinary lessons for week days stand thus in B-C. III. 24. Week\r\n      ι´. (2) 2 Cor. iii, 4-12. (3) iv. 1-6. (4) 11-18. (5) v. 10-15. (6)\r\n      15-21. ιζ´. (2) vi. 11-16. (3) vii. 1-11. (4) 10-16. (5) viii. 7-11.\r\n      (6) 10-21. ιη´.

Brügsch Bey, of Göttingen, and published by\r\n      him in his Neue Bruchstücke des Codex Sinaiticus aufgefunden in der\r\n      Bibliothek des Sinai Klosters, 1875, but is not, after all, part of\r\n      Cod. א. Another morsel, containing Gen. xxiv. 9, 10, and 41-43, now\r\n      at St. Petersburg, really belongs to it.\r\n\r\n  114 J.

Dean Burgon surrendered the position maintained\r\n      in The Last Twelve Verses of St. Mark.\r\n\r\n  116 It has been suggested that this strange mode of division originated\r\n      in the reluctance of scribes to begin a new line with any\r\n      combination of letters which could not commence a Greek word, and to\r\n      end a line with any letter which is not a vowel, or a liquid, or σ,\r\n      or γ before another consonant, except in the case of Proper Names\r\n      (Journal of Sacred Literature, April 1863, p. 8). Certainly the\r\n      general practice in Cod. א bears out the rule thus laid down, though\r\n      a few instances to the contrary occur here and there (Scrivener,\r\n      Collation of Cod. Sinaiticus, Introd. p. xiv, note). Hort refers it\r\n      to a grammatical rule not to end a line with οὐκ or οὐχ, or a\r\n      consonant preceding an elided vowel, as ἀπ᾽, οὐδ᾽. New Testament in\r\n      Greek, p. 315.\r\n\r\n  117 But ΜΗ, ΝΗ, for μη, νη occur even in the Septuagint Cod.\r\n      Sarravianus, also of the fourth century, in which copy numerals are\r\n      quite constantly expressed by letters.\r\n\r\n  118 Tischendorf, however, describes אa as “et formis et atramento primam\r\n      manum tantum non adaequans,” and its writer has been regarded by\r\n      some as little inferior in value to the first scribe. Thus Dr. Hort\r\n      (Introd. p. 271), calling him the “corrector” proper, states that he\r\n      “made use of an excellent exemplar, and the readings which he\r\n      occasionally uses take high rank as authority.” Hort considers אb as\r\n      mixed, אc as still more so.\r\n\r\n  119 I am indebted for the following Memoranda on Cod. א to the kindness\r\n      of the Dean of Derry and Raphoe.\r\n\r\n      i. It is demonstrable that the Eusebian Sections and Canons on the\r\n      margin are contemporaneous with the text. For they are wanting from\r\n      leaves 10 and 15. Now these leaves are conjugate; and they have been\r\n      (on other grounds) noted by Tischendorf as written not by the scribe\r\n      of the body of the N. T., but by one of his colleagues (“D”) who\r\n      wrote part of the O. T. and acted as Diorthota of the N. T. It thus\r\n      appears that, after the marginal numbers had been inserted, the\r\n      sheet containing leaves 10 and 15 was cancelled, and rewritten by a\r\n      contemporary hand. The numbers must therefore have been written\r\n      before the MS. was completed and issued.\r\n\r\n      ii. The exemplar whence these numbers were derived, differed\r\n      considerably from that which the text follows. For, in some cases,\r\n      the sectional numbers indicate the presence of passages which are\r\n      absent from the text. E.g. St. Matt. xvi. 2, 3, which is sect. 162,\r\n      is wanting; and 162 is assigned to ver. 4, while the wrong canon (5\r\n      for 6) betrays the presence in the canonizer’s exemplar of the\r\n      passage omitted by the scribe. The same is true of St. Mark xv. 28\r\n      (in which case the scribe is “D”).\r\n\r\n      iii. The scribe who wrote the text was unacquainted with the\r\n      Eusebian sections. For the beginning of a section is not marked, as\r\n      in A and most subsequent MSS., by a division of the text and a\r\n      larger letter. On the contrary the text is divided into paragraphs\r\n      quite independent of the Eusebian divisions, which often begin in\r\n      the middle of a line, and are marked merely by two dots (:) in\r\n      vermilion, inserted no doubt by the rubricator as he entered the\r\n      numbers in the margin. The fact that the numbers of the sections as\r\n      well as of the canons (not as in other MSS. of the Canons only) are\r\n      in vermilion, points the same way.\r\n\r\n      iv. From the above it follows, (1) That while Cod. א proves the\r\n      absence from its exemplar of certain passages, its margin proves the\r\n      presence of some of them in a contemporaneous exemplar; (2) that\r\n      while on the one hand the Eusebian numbers, coeval with the text,\r\n      show that the MS. cannot be dated before the time of Eusebius, on\r\n      the other hand the form of the text, inasmuch as it is not arranged\r\n      so as to suit them, and as it differs from the text implied in them,\r\n      marks for it a date little, if at all, after his time—certainly many\r\n      years earlier than A.\r\n\r\n      v. As regards the omission of the verses of St. Mark xvi. 9-20, it\r\n      is not correct to assert that Cod. א betrays no sign of\r\n      consciousness of their existence. For the last line of ver. 8,\r\n      containing only the letters τογαρ, has the rest of the space (more\r\n      than half the width of the column) filled up with a minute and\r\n      elaborate “arabesque” executed with the pen in ink and vermilion,\r\n      nothing like which occurs anywhere else in the whole MS. (O. T. or\r\n      N. T.), such spaces being elsewhere invariably left blank. By this\r\n      careful filling up of the blank, the scribe (who here is the\r\n      diorthota “D”), distinctly shows that the omission is not a case of\r\n      “non-interpolation,” but of deliberate excision. John Gwynn, May 21,\r\n      1883.\r\n\r\n  120 He would have written about 20,000 separate uncial letters every\r\n      day. Compare the performance of that veritable Briareus, Nicodemus ὁ\r\n      ξένος, who transcribed the Octateuch (in cursive characters\r\n      certainly) now at Ferrara (Holmes, Cod. 107), beginning his task on\r\n      the 8th of June, and finishing it the 15th of July, A.D. 1334,\r\n      “working very hard”—as he must have done indeed (Burgon, _Guardian_,\r\n      Jan. 29, 1873).\r\n\r\n  121 This opinion, first put forth by Tischendorf in his N. T. Vaticanum\r\n      1867, Proleg. pp. xxi-xxiii, was minutely discussed in the course of\r\n      a review of that book in the _Christian Remembrancer_, October 1867,\r\n      by the writer of these pages. Although Dr. Hort labours to show that\r\n      no critical inferences ought to be drawn from this identity of the\r\n      scribe of Cod. B with the writer of six conjugate leaves of Cod. א\r\n      (being three pairs in three distinct quires, one of them containing\r\n      the conclusion of St. Mark’s Gospel), he is constrained to admit\r\n      that “the fact appears to be sufficiently established by concurrent\r\n      peculiarities in the form of one letter, punctuation, avoidance of\r\n      contractions, and some points of orthography” (Introduction, p.\r\n      213). The internal evidence indeed, though relating to minute\r\n      matters, is cumulative and irresistible, and does not seem to have\r\n      been noticed by Tischendorf, who drew his conclusions from the\r\n      handwriting only.\r\n\r\n  122 Prothero (Memoir of H. Bradshaw, pp. 92-118) reprints a letter of\r\n      Bradshaw from _Guardian_, Jan. 28, 1863, worth studying:—“Simonides\r\n      died hard, and to the very end was supported by a few dupes of his\r\n      ingenious mendacity.” (p. 99.)\r\n\r\n  123 A more favourable estimate of the ecclesiastical policy of Cyril\r\n      (who was murdered by order of the Sultan in 1638, aet. 80) is\r\n      maintained by Dr. Th. Smith, “Collectanea de Cyrillo Lucario,\r\n      Patriarcha Constantinopolitano,” London 1707.\r\n\r\n  124 I.e. “Memorant hunc Librum scriptū fuisse ma-nu Theclae Martyris.”\r\n      On the page over against Cyril’s note the same hand writes\r\n      “videantur literae ejusdé Cyrill: Lucar: ad Georgium Episco Cant”\r\n      [Abbot]; _Harl_: 823, 2. quae extant in Clementis Epistolis ad\r\n      Corinthios editionis Colomesii Lond. 1687 8o page 354 &c.\r\n\r\n  125 Not to mention a few casual _lacunae_ here and there, especially in\r\n      the early leaves of the manuscript, the lower part of one leaf has\r\n      been cut out, so that Gen. xiv. 14-17; xv. 1-5; 16-20; xvi. 6-9 are\r\n      wanting. The leaf containing 1 Sam. xii. 20-xiv. 9, and the nine\r\n      leaves containing Ps. 1. 20-lxxx. 10 (Engl.) are lost.\r\n\r\n  126 Yet we may be sure that these two leaves did not contain the\r\n      Pericope Adulterae, John vii. 58-viii. 11. Taking the Elzevir N. T.\r\n      of 1624, which is printed without breaks for the verses, we count\r\n      286 lines of the Elzevir for the two leaves of Cod. A preceding its\r\n      defect, 288 lines for the two which follow it; but 317 lines for the\r\n      two missing leaves. Deduct the thirty lines containing John vii.\r\n      53-viii. 11, and the result for the lost leaves is 287.\r\n\r\n  127 An excellent facsimile of A is given in the Facsimiles of the\r\n      Palaeographical Society, Plate 106; others in Woide’s New Testament\r\n      from this MS. (1786), and in Baber’s Old Test. (1816). Two specimens\r\n      from the first Epistle of Clement are exhibited in Jacobson’s Patres\r\n      Apostolici, vol. i. p. 110, 1838 (1863); and one in Cassell’s Bible\r\n      Dict. vol. i. p. 49.\r\n\r\n  128 Notice especially what Tregelles says of the Codex Augiensis\r\n      (Tregelles’ Horne’s Introd. vol. iv. p. 198), where the difference\r\n      of hand in the leaves removed from their proper place is much more\r\n      striking than any change in Cod. Alexandrinus. Yet even in that case\r\n      it is likely that one scribe only was engaged. It should be stated,\r\n      however, that Mr. E. Maunde Thompson, who, edits the autotype\r\n      edition, believes that the hand changed at the beginning of St.\r\n      Luke, and altered again at 1 Cor. x. 8. His reasons appear to us\r\n      precarious and insufficient, and he seems to cut away the ground\r\n      from under him when he admits (Praef. p. 9) that “sufficient\r\n      uniformity is maintained to make it difficult to decide the exact\r\n      place where a new hand begins.”\r\n\r\n  129 Tischendorf, Septuagint, Proleg. p. lxv, cites with some approval\r\n      Grabe’s references (Proleg. Cap. i. pp. 9-12) to Gregory Nazianzen\r\n      [d. 389], three of whose Epistles are written to a holy virgin of\r\n      that name (of course not the martyr), to whose παρθενών at Seleucia\r\n      he betook himself, the better to carry out his very sincere _nolo\r\n      episcopari_ on the death of his father Gregory, Bishop of Nazianzus:\r\n      Πρῶτον μὲν ἦλθον εἰς Σελεύκειαν φυγὰς | Τὸν παρθενῶνα τῆς ἀοιδίμου\r\n      κόρης | Θέκλας κ.τ.λ. “De vitâ suâ.”\r\n\r\n  130 The last Arabic numeral in the Old Testament is 641, the first in\r\n      the New Testament 667.\r\n\r\n  131 Very interesting is Whitelock’s notice of a design which was never\r\n      carried out, under the date of March 13, 1645. “The Assembly of\r\n      Divines desired by some of their brethren, sent to the House [of\r\n      Commons] that Mr. Patrick Young might be encouraged in the printing\r\n      of the Greek Testament much expected and desired by the learned,\r\n      especially beyond seas; and an ordinance was read for printing and\r\n      publishing the Old Testament of the Septuagint translation, wherein\r\n      Mr. Young had formerly taken pains and had in his hand, as library\r\n      keeper at St. James’s, an original _Teeta_ [sic] Bible of that\r\n      translation” (Memorials, p. 197, ed. 1732).\r\n\r\n  132 “MSm Alexandm accuratissime ipse contuli, A.D. 1716.

Thorn. 824 Lat., 400 Gr.\r\n\r\n  134 The “Epistle” of Cardinal Carafa to Sixtus V, and the Preface to the\r\n      Reader by the actual editor Peter Morinus, both of which Tischendorf\r\n      reprints in full (Septuagint, Proleg. pp. xxi-xxvii), display an\r\n      amount of critical skill and discernment quite beyond their age, and\r\n      in strange contrast with the signal mismanagement in regard to the\r\n      revision of the Latin Vulgate version under the auspices of the same\r\n      Pope.\r\n\r\n  135 In Pentateuch, Joshua, Judges, Ruth, and 1 Kings i. 1-xix. 11, there\r\n      are forty-four lines in a column; and in 2 Paralip. x. 16-xxvi. 13,\r\n      there are forty lines in a column.\r\n\r\n  136 The writer of the Preface to the sixth volume of the Roman edition\r\n      of 1881 (apparently Fabiani), is jubilant over his discovery of the\r\n      name of this retracer (“eruditissimi et patientissimi viri,” as he\r\n      is pleased to call him, p. xviii) in the person of Clement the Monk,\r\n      who has written his name twice in the book in a scrawl of the\r\n      fifteenth century. But mere resemblance in the ink is but a lame\r\n      proof of identity, and Fabiani recognizes some other correctors,\r\n      whom he designates as B4, posterior to the mischievous\r\n      “instaurator.”\r\n\r\n  137 Hug says _none_, but Tischendorf (Cod. Frid.-Aug. Proleg. p. 9)\r\n      himself detected two in a part that the second scribe had left\r\n      untouched; and not a very few elsewhere (N. T. Vatican. Proleg. pp.\r\n      xx, xxi, 1867); though a break often occurs with no stop by either\r\n      hand. In the much contested passage Rom. ix. 5, Dr. Vance Smith\r\n      (“Revised Texts and Margins,” p. 84, note), while confidently\r\n      claiming the stop after σαρκα in Cod. A as _primâ manu_, and\r\n      noticing the space after the word in Cod. Ephraemi (C), admits that\r\n      “in the Vatican the originality of the stops may be doubtful.” In\r\n      the judgement of Fabiani, “vix aliqua primo exscriptori tribuenda”\r\n      (Praef. N. T. Vat. 1881, p. xviii).\r\n\r\n  138 The publication of the Roman edition (1868-81) enables us to add\r\n      (Abbot, _ubi supra_, p. 193) that the blessings of the twelve\r\n      patriarchs in Gen. xlix are in separate paragraphs numbered from A\r\n      to IB, that the twenty-two names of the unclean birds Deut. xiv.\r\n      12-18, twenty-five kings in Josh. xii. 10-22, eleven dukes in 1 Chr.\r\n      i. 51-54, each stand in a separate line. In Cod. א, especially in\r\n      the New Testament, this arrangement στιχηρῶς is much more frequent\r\n      than in Cod. B, although the practice is in some measure common to\r\n      both.\r\n\r\n  139 The Roman edition (1868-81) also makes known to us that in the Old\r\n      Testament two columns are left blank between Nehemiah and the\r\n      Psalms, which could not have been otherwise, inasmuch as the Psalms\r\n      are written στιχηρῶς with but two columns on a page. Between Tobit\r\n      and Hosea (which book stands first of the Prophetical writings) a\r\n      column is very naturally left blank, and two columns at the end of\r\n      Daniel, with whose prophecy the Old Testament concludes. But these\r\n      peculiarities obviously bear no analogy to the case of the end of\r\n      St. Mark’s Gospel.\r\n\r\n  140 See above, pp. 49-51.\r\n\r\n  141 The writer of the Preface to the Roman edition (vol. vi. Praef. p.\r\n      9, 1881) vainly struggles to maintain the opposite view, because the\r\n      Cardinal, in his Preface to the Complutensian N. T., speaks about\r\n      “adhibitis Vaticanis libris,” as if there was but one there.\r\n\r\n  142 Rulotta’s labours are now printed in Bentleii Critica Sacra by Mr.\r\n      A. A. Ellis, 1862, pp. 121-154.\r\n\r\n  143 Thus the correspondence of Codex B with what St. Basil (c. Eunom.\r\n      ii. 19) states he found in the middle of the fourth century, ἐν τοῖς\r\n      παλαιοῖς τῶν ἀντιγράφων, in Eph. i. 1, viz. τοῖς οὖσιν without ἐν\r\n      Ἐφέσῳ, though now read only in this and the Sinaitic manuscript\r\n      _primâ manu_, and in one cursive copy (Cod. 67) _secundâ manu_,\r\n      seems in itself of but little weight. Another point that has been\r\n      raised is the position of the Epistle to the Hebrews. But this\r\n      argument can apply only to the elder document from which the Vatican\r\n      MS. was taken, and wherein this book unquestionably followed that to\r\n      the Galatians. In Cod. B it _always_ stood in its present place,\r\n      after 2 Thess., as in the Codices cited p. 74, note.\r\n\r\n  144 Besides the twenty-five readings Tischendorf observed himself,\r\n      Cardinal Mai supplied him with thirty-four more for his N. T. of\r\n      1849. His seventh edition of 1859 was enriched by 230 other readings\r\n      furnished by Albert Dressel in 1855.\r\n\r\n  145 “They would not let me open it,” he adds, “without searching my\r\n      pocket, and depriving me of pen, ink, and paper.... If I looked at a\r\n      passage too long the two _prelati_ would snatch the book out from my\r\n      hand.” Tregelles, Lecture on the Historic Evidence of the N.

T. appeared at Ratisbon; at Leyden\r\n      (1860) by A. Kuenen and C. G. Cobet, with a masterly Preface by the\r\n      latter; and at Berlin (1862) by Philip Buttmann, furnished with an\r\n      Appendix containing the varying results of no less than nine\r\n      collations, eight of which we have described in the text, the ninth\r\n      being derived from Lachmann’s Greek Testament (1742, 1850), whose\r\n      readings were all obtained second-hand. Tischendorf does not much\r\n      commend the accuracy of Buttmann’s work.\r\n\r\n  148 “Angelus Mai, quamquam, ut in proverbio est, ἐν τυφλῶν πόλει\r\n      γλαμυρὸς βασιλεύων, non is erat cui tanta res rectè mandari posset:”\r\n      Kuenen and Cobet, N. T. Vat. Praef. p. 1. Tischendorf too, in his\r\n      over querulous Responsa ad Calumnias Romanas &c., 1870, p. 11, is\r\n      not more than just in alleging “Angelum Maium in editionibus suis\r\n      Codicis Vaticani alienissimum se praebuisse ab omni subtiliore rei\r\n      palaeographicae scientiâ, ac tantum non ignarum earum legum ad quas\r\n      is codex in usum criticum edendus esset.” The defence set up for Mai\r\n      in the Preface to the Roman volume of 1881, was that he intended to\r\n      produce only a new edition of the “authentic” Septuagint of 1586-7,\r\n      chiefly for the use of Greek-speaking Catholics.\r\n\r\n  149 The Dean himself on Feb. 20, 1861, and for four subsequent days,\r\n      “went twice over the doubtful passages and facsimilized most of the\r\n      important various readings,” in spite of much opposition from the\r\n      Librarian, who “insisted that our order from Antonelli, although it\r\n      ran ‘per verificare,’ to verify passages, only extended to seeing\r\n      the Codex, not to using it.” (Life by his Widow, pp. 310, 315.)\r\n\r\n  150 “Novum Testamentum Vaticanum post Angeli Maii aliorumque imperfectos\r\n      labores ex ipso codice edidit Ae. F. C. Tischendorf.” Lipsiae, 4to,\r\n      1867.\r\n\r\n  151 To his hand Tischendorf assigns seven readings, Matt. xiii. 52; xiv.\r\n      5; xvi. 4; xxii. 10; xxvii. 4. Luke iii. 1 (_bis_), 7. “For some six\r\n      centuries after it was written B appears to have undergone no\r\n      changes in its text except from the hand of the ‘corrector,’ the\r\n      ‘second hand’ ” (Hort, Introd. p. 270). What then of B2?\r\n\r\n  152 It must surely be to these, the earliest scribes, that Cobet refers\r\n      when he uses language that would not be at all applicable to the\r\n      case of B2 or B3: “In Vaticano duorum librorum veterum testimonia\r\n      continentur, et nihilo plus in primâ manu quam in secundâ inest\r\n      auctoritatis ac fidei. Utriusque unaquaeque lectio ex se ipsâ\r\n      spectanda ponderandaque est, et si hoc ages, modo hanc modo illam\r\n      animadvertes esse potiorem. Hoc autem in primis firmiter tenendum\r\n      est, non esse secundae manûs lectiones correctoris alicujus\r\n      suspiciones aut conjecturas, sive illae sunt acutiores sive\r\n      leviores, sed quidquid a secundâ manu correctum, mutatum, deletum\r\n      esse Maius referat, id omne haud secus atque id quod prior manus\r\n      dederit, perantiqui cujusdam Codicis fide nixum esse.” (N. T. Vat.\r\n      Praef. p. xxvi.)\r\n\r\n  153 It may be mere oversight that in Matt. xxvii. 4 he does not say in\r\n      1867 of what hand the marginal δικαιον is: in his eighth edition\r\n      (1865) he adjudges it to B2. In Matt. xxiv. 23 πιστευητε and ver. 32\r\n      εκφύη he gives to B3 in 1867 what he had assigned to B2 in 1865. The\r\n      Roman Commentary gives no light in the other places, but assigns\r\n      πιστεύητε to B2, B3.\r\n\r\n  154 “Bibliorum Sacrorum Graecus Codex Vaticanus, Auspice Pio IX\r\n      Pontifice Maximo, collatis studiis Caroli Vercellone Sodalis\r\n      Barnabitae, et Josephi Cozza Monachi Basiliani editus. Romae typis\r\n      et impensis S. Congregationis de Propaganda Fide,” square folio,\r\n      1868.\r\n\r\n  155 The feeble rejoinder of the Roman editors was followed up in 1870 by\r\n      Tischendorf’s Responsa ad Calumnias Romanas, &c., the tone of which\r\n      pamphlet we cannot highly praise.\r\n\r\n  156 This practice is plainly confessed to in the Preface to the volume\r\n      of 1881 (p. xvi) without any consciousness of the fatal mistake\r\n      which it involves: “Facies libri Vaticani repraesentata est [ut] ea\r\n      primum omnia apparerent, quae a priore codicis notario profecta\r\n      adhuc manifesto perspiciuntur, tum ea tantum a posterioribus sive\r\n      emendatoribus, sive instauratoribus commutata adderentur, quae sine\r\n      scripturae confusione legi possent.”\r\n\r\n  157 In 1 Cor. vii. 29 Vercellone joins ἐστιν and το closely, but\r\n      Tischendorf leaves a space between them, with a middle point, which\r\n      he expressly states to be _primâ manu_. Again, in ver. 34 Vercellone\r\n      joins μεμερισται with the following και. Tischendorf in 1867 (but\r\n      not in his last edition of the N. T.) interposes a point and space.\r\n      In these _minutiae_ Vercellone, who was not working against time,\r\n      may be presumed to be the more accurate of the two. The editors of\r\n      the sixth volume have no note at either place. Tischendorf detects\r\n      an error of Vercellone, ειτε for ειχε Heb. ix. 1, but this has been\r\n      corrected by the hand in some copies of the Roman volume, as also in\r\n      the Commentary.\r\n\r\n  158 His reasons for regarding the Sinaitic manuscript as the younger\r\n      (_see_ p. 89, note 2) are valid enough so far as they go (Praef. p.\r\n      vi): its initial letters stand out more from the line of the\r\n      writing; abridgements of words are fewer and less simple; it\r\n      contains the Ammonian sections and Eusebian canons instead of the\r\n      antiquated divisions of its rival, and the text is broken up into\r\n      smaller paragraphs. Tregelles, who had seen both copies, used to\r\n      plead the fresher appearance of the Sinaitic, contrasted with the\r\n      worn look of the Vatican MS.; but then its extensive hiatus proves\r\n      that the latter had been less carefully preserved.\r\n\r\n      Eusebius sent to Constantine’s new city (Euseb. Vit. Const. Lib. iv)\r\n      πεντήκοντα σωμάτια ἐν διφθέραις (c. 36) ... ἐν πολυτελῶς ἠσκημένοις\r\n      τεύχεσι τρισσὰ καὶ τετρασσά (c. 37): on which last words Valesius\r\n      notes, “Codices enim membranacei ferè per quaterniones digerebantur,\r\n      hoc est quatuor folia simul compacta, ut terniones tria sunt folia\r\n      simul compacta. Et quaterniones quidem sedecim habebant paginas,\r\n      terniones vero duodenas.” But now that we have come to know that\r\n      Cod. B is arranged in quires of five sheets (_see_ p. 105), that\r\n      manuscript will hardly answer to the description τρισσὰ καὶ τετρασσά\r\n      (see p. 27, note 1) as Cod. א does. Indeed Canon Cook (Revised\r\n      Version, &c., p. 162) objects to Valesius’ explanation altogether,\r\n      on the ground that his sense would rather require τριπλόα καὶ\r\n      τετραπλόα, and that the rare words τρισσά (“three by three”) and\r\n      τετρασσά (“four by four”) exactly describe the arrangement of three\r\n      columns on a page in Cod. B, and four on a page in Cod. א. The Canon\r\n      has since observed that the same view is maintained by O. von\r\n      Gebhardt (“Bibel-text” in Herzog’s Real-Encyklopädie, Leipsic 1878,\r\n      second edition). On the other hand Archdeacon Palmer, in an obliging\r\n      communication made to me, comparing the words πεντήκοντα σωμάτια ἐν\r\n      διφθέραις ἐγκατασκεύοις (c. 36) with ἐν πολυτελῶς ἠσκημένοις\r\n      τεύχεσιν τρισσὰ καὶ τετρασσὰ διαπεμψάντων ἡμῶν, and interpreting\r\n      Eusebius’ compliance (c. 37) by means of Constantine’s directions\r\n      (c. 36), is inclined to refer τρισσὰ καὶ τετρασσά to σωμάτια, as if\r\n      it were “we sent abroad the collections [of writings] in richly\r\n      adorned cases, three or four in a case.” It will probably be thought\r\n      that the expression is on the whole too obscure to be depended on\r\n      for any controversial purposes. It is safer to argue that if the\r\n      sections and canons extant in Cod. א be by a contemporary hand\r\n      (_see_ p. 93, and Dean Gwynn’s _Memoranda_ in our _Addenda_ for that\r\n      page), that circumstance, the great antiquity of the manuscript\r\n      considered, will confirm the probability of Eusebius’ connexion with\r\n      it. Eusebius agrees also with א in omitting ἡ πύλη, Matt. vii. 13,\r\n      and knew of copies, not however the best or with his approval, which\r\n      inserted ἡσαΐου before τοῦ προφήτου in Matt. xiii. 35: א being the\r\n      only uncial which exhibits that reading. So again Eusebius after\r\n      Origen maintains the impossible number ἑκατὸν ἑξήκοντα of א and a\r\n      few others in Luke xxiv. 13. Dr. C. R. Gregory, Prolegomena, pp.\r\n      347, 348, inclines to the belief that B and א were among the fifty\r\n      MSS. sent by Eusebius to Constantino about A.D. 331-2. Canon Cook’s\r\n      entire argument (Revised Version of the First Three Gospels (1882),\r\n      pp. 160-165) should be consulted.\r\n\r\n  159 Dublin University Magazine, Nov. 1859, p. 620. Even Bishop\r\n      Lightfoot, a strong and consistent admirer of the manuscript, speaks\r\n      of its “impatience of apparently superfluous words” (Epistle to the\r\n      Colossians, p. 316). Dr. Hort (Introduction, p. 235) pleads that\r\n      such facts “have no bearing on either the merits or the demerits of\r\n      the scribe of B, except as regards the absolutely singular readings\r\n      of B,” whereas multitudes of these omissions are found in other good\r\n      documents.\r\n\r\n  160 Dean Burgon cites four specimens of such repetitions: Matt. xxi. 4,\r\n      five words written twice over; ib. xxvi. 56-7, six words; Luke i.\r\n      37, three words or one line; John xvii. 18, six words. These,\r\n      however, are but a few out of many. Nor is Tischendorf’s judgement\r\n      at variance with our own. Speaking of some supposed or possible\r\n      gross _errata_ of the recent Roman edition, he puts in the\r\n      significant proviso “tamen haec quoque satis cum universâ scripturae\r\n      Vaticanae vitiositate conveniunt” (Appendix N. T. Vaticani, 1869, p.\r\n      xvii).\r\n\r\n  161 The latest Roman editors incline to an Egyptian origin, rather than\r\n      one suggested in Magna Graecia, but the only fresh reason they\r\n      allege can have very slight weight, namely, that two of the damaged\r\n      leaves have been repaired by pieces of papyrus. The learned Ceriani\r\n      of Milan believes that Cod. B was written in Italy, Cod. א in\r\n      Palestine or Syria (Quarterly Review, April, 1882, p. 355). The\r\n      supposed Eusebian origin of both has been already stated.\r\n\r\n  162 As this manuscript is of first-rate importance it is necessary to\r\n      subjoin a full list of the passages it contains, that it may not be\r\n      cited _e silentio_ for what it does not exhibit: Matt. i. 2-v. 15;\r\n      vii. 5-xvii. 26; xviii. 28-xxii. 20; xxiii. 17-xxiv. 10; xxiv.\r\n      45-xxv. 30; xxvi. 22-xxvii. 11; xxvii. 47-xxviii. 14: Mark i. 17-vi.\r\n      31; viii. 5-xii. 29; xiii. 19-xvi. 20: Luke i. 2-ii. 5; ii. 42-iii.\r\n      21; iv. 25-vi. 4; vi. 37-vii. 16 or 17; viii. 28-xii. 3; xix. 42-xx.\r\n      27; xxi. 21-xxii. 19; xxiii. 25-xxiv. 7; xxiv. 46-53: John i. 1-41;\r\n      iii. 33-v. 16; vi. 38-vii. 3; viii. 34-ix. 11; xi. 8-46; xiii.\r\n      8-xiv. 7; xvi. 21-xviii. 36; xx. 26-xxi. 25: Acts i. 2-iv. 3; v.\r\n      35-x. 42; xiii. 1-xvi. 36; xx. 10-xxi. 30; xxii. 21-xxiii. 18; xxiv.\r\n      15-xxvi. 19; xxvii. 16-xxviii. 4: James i. 1-iv. 2: 1 Pet. i. 2-iv.\r\n      6: 2 Pet. i. 1-1 John iv. 2: 3 John 3-15: Jude 3-25: Rom. i. 1-ii.\r\n      5; iii. 21-ix. 6; x. 15-xi. 31; xiii. 10-1 Cor. vii. 18; ix. 6-xiii.\r\n      8; xv. 40-2 Cor. x. 8: Gal. i. 20-vi. 18: Eph. ii. 18-iv. 17: Phil.\r\n      i. 22-iii. 5: Col. i. 1-1 Thess. ii. 9: Heb. ii. 4-vii. 26; ix.\r\n      15-x. 24; xii. 15-xiii. 25: 1 Tim. iii. 9-v. 20; vi. 21-Philem. 25:\r\n      Apoc. i. 2-iii. 19; v. 14-vii. 14; vii. 17-viii. 4; ix. 17-x. 10;\r\n      xi. 3-xvi. 13; xviii. 2-xix. 5. Of all the books only 2 John and 2\r\n      Thess. are entirely lost; about thirty-seven chapters of the\r\n      Gospels, ten of the Acts, forty-two of the Epistles, eight of the\r\n      Apocalypse have perished. The order of the books is indicated, p.\r\n      74.\r\n\r\n  163 The following Medicean manuscripts seem to have come into the Royal\r\n      Library by the same means; Evan. 16, 19, 42, 317. Act. 12, 126.\r\n      Paul. 164. It appears therefore that Cod. C was not one of the\r\n      manuscripts bought of Marshal Strozzi (Pattison, Life of Is.\r\n      Casaubon, p. 202), which were only 800 out of the 4,500 which\r\n      belonged to the Queen (ibid. p. 204).\r\n\r\n  164 Bp. Chr. Wordsworth (N. T. Part iv. p. 159) reminds us of Wetstein’s\r\n      statement (Bentley’s Correspondence, p. 501) that it had cost him\r\n      two hours to read one page; so that his £50 were not so easily\r\n      earned, after all. This collation is preserved in Trinity College\r\n      Library, B. xvii. 7, 9.\r\n\r\n  165 Dr. Hort, with his ever ready acuteness, draws certain inferences to\r\n      be discussed hereafter from the fact that a displacement in the\r\n      leaves of the exemplar wherefrom the Apocalypse in Cod. C was\r\n      copied, which the scribe of C did not notice, proves it to have been\r\n      a book of nearly 120 small leaves, and accordingly that it “formed a\r\n      volume either to itself or without considerable additions”\r\n      (Introduction, p. 268).\r\n\r\n  166 Very remarkable is the language of the University in returning\r\n      thanks for the gift: “Nam hoc scito, post unicae scripturae\r\n      sacratissimam cognitionem, nullos unquam ex omni memoriâ temporum\r\n      scriptores extitisse, quos memorabili viro Johanni Calvino tibique\r\n      praeferamus.” Scrivener’s Codex Bezae, Introd. p. vi.\r\n\r\n  167 Matt. i. 1-20; vi. 20-ix. 2; xxvii. 2-12: John i. 16-iii. 26: Acts\r\n      viii. 29-x. 14; xxi. 2-10; 15-18 (though Ussher, Mill, Wetstein and\r\n      Dickinson cite several readings from these verses, which must have\r\n      been extant in their time); xxii. 10-20; 29-xxviii. 31 in the\r\n      _Greek_: Matt. i. 1-11; vi. 8-viii. 27; xxvi. 65-xxvii. 1: John i.\r\n      1-iii. 16: Acts viii. 20-x. 4; xx. 31-xxi. 2; 7-10; xxii. 2-10;\r\n      xxii. 20-xxviii. 31 in the _Latin_. The original writing has\r\n      perished in the following, which are supplied by a scribe of not\r\n      earlier than the ninth century: Matt. iii. 7-16: Mark xvi. 15-20:\r\n      John xviii. 14-xx. 13 in the _Greek_: Matt. ii. 21-iii. 7: Mark xvi.\r\n      6-20: John xviii. 2-xx. 1 in the _Latin_. A fragment, containing a\r\n      few words of Matt. xxvi. 65-67 (Latin) and xxvii. 2 (Greek), (Fol.\r\n      96, Scrivener), was overlooked by Kipling.\r\n\r\n  168 It is surprising that any one should have questioned the identity of\r\n      Cod. D with Stephen’s β´. No other manuscript has been discovered\r\n      which agrees with β´ in the many singular readings and arbitrary\r\n      additions in support of which it is cited by Stephen. That he\r\n      omitted so many more than he inserted is no argument against their\r\n      identity, since we know that he did the same in the case of his α´\r\n      (the Complutensian Polyglott) and η´ (Codex L, Paris 62). The great\r\n      inaccuracy of Stephen’s _margin_ (the text is much better revised)\r\n      is so visible from these and other well-ascertained instances that\r\n      no one ought to wonder if β´ is alleged occasionally (not often) for\r\n      readings which D does not contain. On a careful analysis of all the\r\n      variations imputed to β´ by Stephen, they will be found to amount to\r\n      389 in the parts written in the original hand, whereof 309 are\r\n      alleged quite correctly, forty-seven a little loosely, while in\r\n      eight instances corrected readings are regarded in error as from the\r\n      original scribe. Of the twenty-five places which remain, all but\r\n      three had been previously discovered in other copies used by\r\n      Stephen, so that β´ in their case has been substituted by mistake\r\n      for some other numeral. One of the three remaining has recently been\r\n      accounted for by Mr. A. A. Vansittart, who has found καὶ\r\n      περισσευθήσεται added to δοθήσεται αὐτῷ (Luke viii. 18 from Matt.\r\n      xiii. 12) in Stephen’s θ´ or Coislin 200 at Paris (No. 38, of the\r\n      Gospels). I do not find β´ cited by Stephen after Acts xx. 24,\r\n      except indeed in Rom. iii. 10 (with α´), in manifest error, just as\r\n      in the Apocalypse xix. 14 ε´ (No. 6 of the Gospels), which does not\r\n      contain this book, is cited instead of ιε´; or as ια´ is quoted in\r\n      xiii. 4, _but not elsewhere in the Apocalypse_, undoubtedly in the\r\n      place of ιϛ´; or as ιϛ´, which had broken off at xvii. 8, reappears\r\n      instead of ιε´ in xx. 3. In the various places named in the last\r\n      note, wherein the Greek of Cod. D is lost, β´ is cited only at Matt.\r\n      xxvii. 3, beyond question instead of η´; and for _part_ of the\r\n      reading in Acts ix. 31, δ´ (to which the whole rightly belongs)\r\n      being alleged for the other part. In John xix. 6, indeed, where the\r\n      original Greek is missing, β´ is cited, but it is for a reading\r\n      actually extant in the modern hand which has there supplied Codex\r\n      D’s defects.\r\n\r\n  169 “Ils s’emparèrent des portes et de tous les lieux forts ... non pas\r\n      sans leur impiétes et barbaries accoutumées envers les choses\r\n      saintes” (Mézeray, Hist. de France, tom. iii. p. 87, 1685).\r\n      Accordingly, travellers are shown to this day the bones of unclean\r\n      animals which the Huguenots, in wanton mockery, then mingled with\r\n      the presumed remains of St. Irenaeus and the martyrs of Lyons.\r\n\r\n  170 One cannot understand why Wetstein (N. T. Proleg. vol. i, 30) should\r\n      have supposed that Beza _prevaricated_ as to the means whereby he\r\n      procured his manuscript. He was not the man to be at all ashamed of\r\n      spoiling the Philistines, and the bare mention of Lyons in connexion\r\n      with the year 1562 would have been abundantly intelligible scarce\r\n      twenty years afterwards. It is however remarkable that in the last\r\n      edition of his Annotations (1598) he nowhere calls it Codex\r\n      Lugdunensis, but _Claromontanus_ (notes on Luke xix. 26; Acts xx.\r\n      3); for, though it might be natural that Beza, at eighty years of\r\n      age and after the lapse of so long a time, should confound the Lyons\r\n      copy with his own Codex Claromontanus of St. Paul’s Epistles (D);\r\n      yet the only way in which we can account for the Codex Bezae being\r\n      collated in _Italy_ for Stephen, is by adopting Wetstein’s\r\n      suggestion that it was the actual copy (“antiquissimum codicem\r\n      Graecum”) taken to the Council of Trent in 1546 by William a Prato,\r\n      Bishop of Clermont in Auvergne, to confirm the Latin reading in John\r\n      xxi. 22 “sic eum volo,” which D alone may seem to do. Some learned\r\n      man (ὑπὸ τῶν ἡμετέρων φίλων does not well suit his son Henry) might\r\n      have sent to Robert Stephen from Tren the readings of a manuscript\r\n      to which attention had been thus specially directed.\r\n\r\n  171 Not more than eighty-three typographical errors have been detected\r\n      in Kipling throughout his difficult task, whereof sixteen are in his\r\n      Annotations, &c.\r\n\r\n  172 In St. Luke 136 (143 Lat.): in what remains of St. Matthew 583 (590\r\n      Lat.), of St. Mark 148, of St. John 165 (168 Lat.), of the Acts 235.\r\n      The later παραγραφαί, indicated by [symbol] (_see_ p. 51, note 3),\r\n      though forty-five out of the forty-nine are firmly and neatly made,\r\n      and often resemble in colour the ink of the original scribe, can be\r\n      shown to be full four centuries later (Scrivener, Cod. Bezae,\r\n      Introd. p. xxviii).\r\n\r\n  173 Bradshaw (Prothero’s Memoirs, p. 97) in a letter to the _Guardian_,\r\n      Jan. 28, 1863, writes thus:—“I saw Cod. א at Leipsig _per_\r\n      Tischendorf. I had been curious to know whether it was written in\r\n      even quaternions throughout, like the Cod. Bezae, or in a series of\r\n      fasciculi, each ending with a quire of varying size, like the Cod.\r\n      Alexandrinus, and I found the latter to be the case. This,\r\n      by-the-bye, is sufficient to prove”—why, is not quite clear—“that it\r\n      cannot be the volume which Dr. Simonides speaks of having written at\r\n      Mount Athos.”\r\n\r\n  174 Yet Φ (Beratinus) and Σ (Rossanensis) contain St. Matthew and St.\r\n      Mark, and are probably a little older than D.\r\n\r\n  175 H. C. Hoskier, Collation of Cod. 604, &c. Appendix F. Mr. Hoskier\r\n      saw the MS. on May 18, 1886.\r\n\r\n  176 In our facsimile (No. 21), over against the beginning of Mark xvi.\r\n      8, is set the number of the section (ΣΛΓ or 233), above the\r\n      corresponding Eusebian canon (B or 2).\r\n\r\n  177 Dr. Hort more exactly reckons that these leaves apparently contain\r\n      Mark vi. 53-vii. 4; vii. 21-viii. 32; ix. 1-x. 43; xi. 7-xii. 19;\r\n      xiv. 25-xv. 22 (_Addenda and Corrigenda_ to Tregelles’s N. T., p.\r\n      1019), adding that Tischendorf had access also to a few verses\r\n      preserved in the collections of the Russian Bishop Porphyry. They\r\n      are published in Duchesne’s “Archives des Missions scientifiques et\r\n      littéraires” (Paris, 1877), 3e sér. tom. iii. pp. 386-419.\r\n\r\n  178 These songs, with thirteen others from the Old Testament and\r\n      Apocrypha, though _partially_ written in uncial letters, are\r\n      included in a volume of Psalms and Hymns, whose prevailing character\r\n      is early cursive.\r\n\r\n  179 From Tischendorf’s copy of Od Dr. Caspar René Gregory has gathered\r\n      readings in Heb. v. 8-vi. 10, and sent them to Dr. Hort.\r\n\r\n  180 I.e., twenty lines on a page, according to the form used in this\r\n      edition.\r\n\r\n  181 They had been previously described in a tract “Jac.

A second hand has supplied ch. xv. 19-21.\r\n\r\n  186 For the Coptic style of the letters Tischendorf compares a double\r\n      palimpsest leaf in the British Museum, containing 1 Kings viii.\r\n      58-ix. 1, which he assigns to the fifth century, although the\r\n      capital letters stand out a little, and are slightly larger than the\r\n      rest (Monum. sacr. ined. vol. ii. Proleg. p. xliv). But both Dr.\r\n      Wright and Mr. E. Maunde Thompson, from their great experience in\r\n      this style of writing, have come to suspect that it is usually\r\n      somewhat less ancient than from other indications might be supposed.\r\n\r\n  187 Tischendorf found breathings also in the palimpsest Numbers (Monum.\r\n      sac. ined. _ubi supra_, p. xxv).\r\n\r\n  188 I say _almost_, for Bengel’s description makes it plain that this is\r\n      the Moscow manuscript from which F. C. Gross sent him the extracts\r\n      that Wetstein copied and numbered Evan. 87. Bengel, however, states\r\n      that the cursive portion from John vii onwards bears the date of\r\n      6508 or A.D. 1000. Scholz was the first to notice this identity\r\n      (_see_ Evan. 250).\r\n\r\n  189 Notwithstanding, the Eusebian canons have been washed out of Wb, a\r\n      strong confirmation of what was conjectured above, p. 61.\r\n\r\n  190 Codex X contains Matt. vi. 6, 10, 11; vii. 1-ix. 20; ix. 34-xi. 24;\r\n      xii. 9-xvi. 28; xvii. 14-xviii. 25; xix. 22-xxi. 13; 28-xxii. 22;\r\n      xxiii. 27-xxiv. 2; 23-35; xxv. 1-30; xxvi. 69-xxvii. 12; Mark vi.\r\n      47-Luke i. 37; ii. 19-iii. 38; iv. 21-x. 37; xi. 1-xviii. 43; xx.\r\n      46-John ii. 22; vii. 1-xiii. 5; xiii. 20-xv. 25; xvi. 23-xxi. 25.\r\n      The hiatus in John ii. 22-vii. 1 is supplied on paper in a hand of\r\n      the twelfth century; Mark xiv. 61-64; xiv. 72-xv. 4; xv. 33-xvi. 6\r\n      are illegible in parts, and xvi. 6-8 have perished.

Hansell prints in red these additional readings thus fresh\r\n      brought to light in the Appendix to his “Texts of the oldest\r\n      existing manuscripts of the New Testament,” Oxford, 1864.\r\n\r\n  194 “Barrett’s edition shows that of the sixty-four pages of the MS.\r\n      fifty had originally twenty-one lines to the page, and fourteen had\r\n      twenty-three.” Dr. Ezra Abbot.\r\n\r\n  195 These are Matt. vi. 16-29; vii. 26-viii. 27; xii. 18-xiv. 15; xx.\r\n      25-xxi. 19; xxii. 25-xxiii. 13; John vi. 14-viii. 3; xv. 24-xix. 6.\r\n\r\n  196 In the St. Petersburg portion are all the rest of St. John, and\r\n      Matt. i. 1-v. 31; ix. 6-xii. 18; xiv. 15-xx. 25; xxiii. 13-xxviii.\r\n      20; or all St. Matthew except 115 verses.\r\n\r\n  197 Dr. Gregory, Tisch. Prolegomena, p. 401, quotes Gardthausen,\r\n      Griechische Palaeogr., Lipsiae, 1879, pp. 159, 344, as assigning\r\n      A.D. 979 as the date.\r\n\r\n  198 The edition was posthumous, and has prefixed to it a touching “Life”\r\n      of two pages in length, by his brother and pupil, dwelling\r\n      especially on Rettig’s happy change in his later days from\r\n      rationalism to a higher and spiritual life.\r\n\r\n  199 Viz. Rom. iii. 5; 1 Cor. ii. 8; 1 Tim. ii. 4; iv. 10; vi. 4; 2 Tim.\r\n      ii. 15. Equally strong are the notices of Aganon, who is cited eight\r\n      times in Δ, about sixteen in G. This personage was Bishop of\r\n      Chartres, and a severe disciplinarian, who died A.D. 941; a fact\r\n      which does not hinder our assigning Cod. Δ to the ninth century, as\r\n      Rettig states that all notices of him are by a later hand. There is\r\n      the less need of multiplying proofs of this kind, as Tregelles has\r\n      observed, a circumstance which demonstrates to a certainty the\r\n      identity of Cod. Δ and G. When he was at Dresden he found in Cod. G\r\n      twelve leaves of later writing in precisely the same hand as several\r\n      that are lithographed by Rettig, because they were attached to Cod.\r\n      Δ. “Thus,” he says, “these MSS. once formed one book; and when\r\n      separated, some of the superfluous leaves with additional writing\r\n      attached to the former part, and some to the latter” (Tregelles’\r\n      Horne’s Introd. vol. iv. p. 197).\r\n\r\n  200 The portion of this manuscript contained in Paul. G was divided into\r\n      στίχοι on the same principle by Hug (Introduction, vol. i. p. 283,\r\n      Wait’s translation).\r\n\r\n  201 Λ (1) is really an Evangelistary.

Gywnn of Raphoe is so good as to remind me that among the\r\n      other proper names enumerated by Wetstein and Semler as written on\r\n      the reverse of the last leaf of this manuscript, ΘΕΩΔΟΡΟΣ stands by\r\n      itself in a hand which may be as old as the seventh century. Common\r\n      as the name is, the fact is interesting and suggestive. For the\r\n      orthography compare κωλονια Acts xvi. 12 in Cod. E.\r\n\r\n  206 It is probable that Mill got this from “Nouvelles Observations sur\r\n      le Texte et les Versions du Nouveau Testament,” par R. Simon, Paris,\r\n      1695.\r\n\r\n  207 I see no force in Tischendorf’s objection, that if Theodore had\r\n      brought Cod. E to England, Bede would have used it before he came to\r\n      write his “Expositio Retractata.”\r\n\r\n  208 The names and order of the books of the New Testament in this most\r\n      curious and venerable list stand thus: Matthew, John, Mark, Luke,\r\n      Romans, 1, 2 Corinth., Galat., Ephes., 1, 2 Tim., Tit., Colos.,\r\n      _Filimon_, 1, 2 Pet., James, 1, 2, 3 John, Jude, Barnabas’ Ep.,\r\n      John’s Revelation, Act. Apost., Pastor [Hermas], Actus Paul.,\r\n      Revelatio Petri.\r\n\r\n  209 Facsimiles of this manuscript are given by Semler in his edition of\r\n      Wetstein’s Prolegomena (1764, Nos. 8, 9). Bianchini’s estimate of\r\n      its age (Evangeliarium Quadruples, tom. ii. fol. 591, 2), as of the\r\n      seventh century, is certainly too high.\r\n\r\n  210 Facsimile of 1 Tim. vi. 19-2 Tim. i. 5 is given in Pal.

Boern. Lips. 1754, p. 6, cited\r\n      by Matthaei Cod. Boern. p. xviii. But there must have been some\r\n      misunderstanding on both sides, for it appears from a manuscript\r\n      note in his copy of the Oxford N. T. of 1675 (Trin. Coll. B. xvii.\r\n      8), that Bentley considered Cod. G his own property; since after\r\n      describing Cod. F before the Epistle to the Romans as his own, and\r\n      as commencing at Rom. iii. 19, he adds “Variae lectiones ex altero\r\n      _nostro_ MSto, ejusdem veteris exemplaris apographo.”\r\n\r\n  215 viz. ημας for υμας, Rom. xvi. 17; μετρους for μερους, Eph. iv. 16;\r\n      εσκοτισμενος for -μενοι, iv. 18. Add to these στωμα for σωμα, 1 Cor.\r\n      ix, 27, as cited by Bentley (Ellis, Critica Sacra, p. 36).\r\n\r\n  216 By John O’Donovan, Editor of Irish Annals. I have been favoured with\r\n      corrections by the late Dr. Todd, of Trinity College, Dublin, and\r\n      recently by the Rev. Robert King of Ballymena, whose version I have\r\n      ventured to adopt.\r\n\r\n      Téicht do róim [téicht do róim]: To come to Rome, to come to Rome,\r\n      Mór saido becic torbai: Much of trouble, little of profit,\r\n      Inrí chondaigi hifoss: The thing thou seekest here,\r\n      Manimbera latt ni fog bai: If thou bring not with thee, thou findest\r\n      not.\r\n\r\n      Mór báis mór baile: Great folly, great madness,\r\n      Mór coll ceille mór mire: Great ruin of sense, great insanity,\r\n      Olais airchenn teicht dóecaib: Since thou hast set out for death,\r\n      Beith fó étoil maic Maire.: That thou shouldest be in disobedience\r\n      to the Son of Mary.\r\n\r\n      The second stanza intimates that as the pilgrimage to Rome is at the\r\n      risk of life, it is folly not to be at peace with Christ before we\r\n      set out. The opening words “To come to Rome” imply that the verses\r\n      were written there by some disappointed pilgrim. Since the\r\n      handwriting resembles that of the interlinear Latin, Mr. King\r\n      suggests that both may have been the work of the Scottish Bishop\r\n      Marcus, or of his nephew Moengal (Rettig, Cod. Δ, Prolegomena, p.\r\n      xx), who called at St. Gall on their return from Rome, whence Marcus\r\n      went homewards, leaving his books and Moengal behind him.\r\n\r\n  217 Here αου standing to represent _au_ shows that the Greek is derived\r\n      from the Latin, not _vice versâ_.\r\n\r\n  218 That Cod. G cannot have been taken from Cod. G appears both from\r\n      matters connected with their respective Latin versions, and because\r\n      F contains no trace of the vacant lines left in G at the end of Rom.\r\n      xiv to receive ch. xvi. 25-27. But Dr. Hort (Journal of Philology,\r\n      vol. iii. No. 5, pp. 67, 68 note) has come to think that F is a mere\r\n      transcript of G, the scribe of the former being by far the more\r\n      ignorant of the two. He meets our argument to the contrary stated\r\n      above in the text, by alleging that in respect to the division of\r\n      words F is free from no outrageous portent found in G, while it has\r\n      to answer for many of its own. But (to take our examples from one\r\n      open leaf) if the writer of F were so helplessly ignorant as Dr.\r\n      Hort represents, how could he have set right G’s error in 1 Tim. iv.\r\n      7, reading και · γραωδεις for G’s και αιγραωδεις? Again, if F had\r\n      before him an undivided manuscript, one can easily account for such\r\n      monsters as in 1 Tim. iv. 2 και · καυτη ριασ μενων· F (_photographed\r\n      page_), but no one could possibly have so written with G’s\r\n      κεκαυτηριασμενων before him. That the two copies were compared\r\n      together in after times seems evident from the fact stated in p.\r\n      179, that Latin renderings from G stand in eighty-six places above\r\n      the Greek of F. It was at the same time perhaps that some\r\n      ill-divided words in F were corrected by means of a loop from the\r\n      Greek of G: e.g. 2 Cor. i. 3 οικτιρμων G, οικ [symbol] τιρμων F; ii.\r\n      14 θριαμβευοντι G, θριαμ [symbol] βεὐοντι F; iv. 9\r\n      ενκαταλιμπαννομενοι G, εν · καταλιμπαν [symbol] νομενοι F; ver. 15\r\n      πλεονασασα G, πλεονα [symbol] σασα F. ’Mr. Hort’s view, that F was\r\n      copied directly from G’ (writes Bishop Lightfoot very gently,\r\n      Journal of Philology, vol. iii. No. 6, p. 210, note), “deserves\r\n      consideration, and may prove true, though his arguments do not seem\r\n      quite conclusive.” Lightfoot elsewhere pronounces that “the\r\n      divergent phenomena of the two Latin texts” seem unfavourable to Dr.\r\n      Hort’s hypothesis (Ep. to Coloss. p. 355, note 2). But the latter\r\n      still adheres to it with characteristic firmness: “we believe F to\r\n      be as certainly in its Greek text a transcript of G [as E is of D];\r\n      if not, it is an inferior copy of the same immediate exemplar”\r\n      (Introd. p. 150). Yet why “inferior”?\r\n\r\n  219 Epistularum Paulinarum codd. Gr. et Lat. scriptas Augiensem\r\n      Boernerianum Claromontanum examinavit, &c.

Griesbach\r\n      and Scholz number the London part as 64, the Hamburg part as 53.\r\n\r\n  223 Griesbach (Symbol. Critic. vol. ii. p. 166) says that in the\r\n      Harleian fragment “Iota bis tantum aut ter subscribitur, semel\r\n      postscribitur, plerumque omittitur,” overlooking the second ascript.\r\n      Scrivener repeats this statement about ι subscript (Cod. Augiens.\r\n      Introd. p. lxxii), believing he had verified it: but Tischendorf\r\n      cannot see the subscripts, nor can Scrivener on again consulting\r\n      Harl. 5613 for the purpose. Tregelles too says, “I have not seen a\r\n      _sub_scribed iota in any uncial document” (Printed Text, p. 158,\r\n      note).\r\n\r\n  224 Tregelles, wishing to reserve the letter B for the great Codex\r\n      Vaticanus 1209, called this copy first L (N. T. Part iv. p. iii),\r\n      and afterwards Q (N. T. Part vi. p. i). Surely Mr. Vansittart was\r\n      right (Journal of Philology, vol. ii. No. 3, p. 41) in protesting\r\n      against a change so needless and inconvenient; nor has Tischendorf\r\n      adopted it in his eighth edition of the N. T.\r\n\r\n  225 Very many corrections have been made in the following Catalogue as\r\n      well from investigations of my own as from information kindly\r\n      furnished to me by Mr. H. Bradshaw, University Librarian at\r\n      Cambridge, by Professor Hort, by Mr. A. A. Vansittart, late Fellow\r\n      of Trinity College there [d. 1882], by Mr. W. Kelly, and especially\r\n      by Dean Burgon, to whom the present edition is more deeply indebted\r\n      than it would be possible to acknowledge in detail. His series of\r\n      Letters addressed to me in the _Guardian_ newspaper (1873) contains\r\n      but a part of the help he has afforded towards the preparation of\r\n      this and the second edition.

Since Evan. 18 or Reg. 47 contains the whole N. T., and\r\n      Stephen cites ζ´ in the Acts once (ch. xvii. 5), in the Catholic\r\n      Epistles seven times, in the Pauline twenty-seven, in the Apocalypse\r\n      never; Reg. 47 has been suggested to have been Stephen’s ζ´, rather\r\n      than Cod. 8 or Reg. 49. On testing the two with Steph. ζ´ in eight\r\n      places, Mr. Vansittart found that they both agreed with it in five\r\n      (Matt. xx. 12; Mark vi. 20; x. 52; Luke vi. 37; John vi. 58), but\r\n      that in the remaining three (Mark xii. 31; Luke i. 37; John x. 32)\r\n      Reg. 49 agreed with ζ´, while Reg. 47 did not.\r\n\r\n  228 Stephen includes his θ᾽ among the copies that αὐτοὶ πανταχόθεν\r\n      συνηθροίσαμεν, which might suit the case of Coislin. 200, as St.\r\n      Louis would have brought or sent it to France. Mr. Vansittart tested\r\n      Cod. 38 in Matt. xxvi. 45; Luke viii. 18; xix. 26; James v. 5; 2\r\n      Pet. ii. 18, and found it agree in all with Stephen’s θ᾽. What of\r\n      ἀγγελία, 1 John i. 5? In Luke viii. 18 that most careless editor\r\n      misprints β᾽ when he means θ᾽.

T.\r\n      Proleg. § 1445). Yet since Burgon testifies that its text “is not\r\n      broken up into Paragraphs after all,” Mill can only intend to\r\n      designate in a roundabout way the presence of the larger chapters\r\n      (p. 55) with their appropriate capitals.\r\n\r\n  230 On the death of Dr. John Moore, Bishop of Ely (whose honesty as a\r\n      book-collector is impeached, on no fair grounds, by Tew in Bridge’s\r\n      “Northamptonshire,” vol. ii. p. 45, Oxon. 1791), in 1714, George I\r\n      was induced to buy his books and manuscripts for the Library at\r\n      Cambridge, amounting to 30,000 volumes, in acknowledgement of the\r\n      attachment of the University to the House of Hanover. Every one\r\n      remembers the epigram which this royal gift provoked. _See_ “Cap and\r\n      Gown,” p. 15.\r\n\r\n  231 “We often hear,” said a witty and most reverend Irish Prelate, “that\r\n      the text of the Three Heavenly Witnesses is a _gloss_; and any one\r\n      that will go into the College Library may see as much for himself.”\r\n      It was a little bold in Mr. Charles Forster (“A New Plea,” &c., pp.\r\n      119, 120, 139), whose zeal in defence of what he held to be the\r\n      truth I heartily revere, to urge the authority of Dr. Adam Clarke\r\n      for assigning this manuscript to the thirteenth century, the rather\r\n      since almost in the same breath, he stigmatizes the Wesleyan\r\n      minister for a “self-taught philomath” (p. 122). Dr. Clarke tells us\r\n      fairly the grounds on which he arrived at his strange conclusion\r\n      (Observations on the Text of the Three Divine Witnesses, Manchester,\r\n      1805, pp. 8-10), and marvellously unsound they are. But what avails\r\n      authority, _quum res ipsa per se clamat_? The facsimile made for Dr.\r\n      Clarke nearly seventy years ago has been copied in Horne’s\r\n      Introduction and twenty other books, and leaves no sort of doubt\r\n      about the date of Codex Montfortianus.\r\n\r\n  232 This Froy or Roy is believed by Mr. Rendel Harris (Origin of Cod.\r\n      Leic., p. 48) to be the forger of Cod. 61.\r\n\r\n  233 Another facsimile (Luke xxi. 36-John viii. 6) is given by Abbott in\r\n      his “Collation of Four Important Manuscripts” (_see_ Cod. 13). In\r\n      all four the _pericope adulterae_ follows Luke xxi. 38.\r\n\r\n  234 See the style of the Evangelistaria, as cited above, pp. 80-83;\r\n      Matthaei’s uncials BH and Birch’s 178 of the Gospels, described\r\n      below. So B.-C. ii. 13, to be described hereafter, reads in St.\r\n      Matthew only ἀρχ᾽ ἐκ τοῦ κατὰ ματθαῖον ἁγίου εὐαγγελίου. Compare\r\n      also Codd. 211, 261, 357, and B.-C. iii. 5 in SS. Matthew and Mark.\r\n\r\n  235 Of the 183 manuscript volumes bequeathed by William Wake, Archbishop\r\n      of Canterbury [1657-1737] to Christ Church (of which he had been a\r\n      Canon), no less than twenty-eight contain portions of the Greek\r\n      Testament. They are all described in this list from a comparison of\r\n      Dean Gaisford’s MS. Catalogue (1837) with the books themselves, to\r\n      which Bp. Jacobson’s kindness gave me access in 1861. Corrected by\r\n      E. M., to whom similar kindness has been shown. See also “Account of\r\n      some MSS. at Christ Church, Oxford,” by the Rev. Charles H. Hoole,\r\n      Student.\r\n\r\n  236 These formal revisions of the Latin Bible were mainly two, one made\r\n      by the University of Paris with the sanction of the Archbishop of\r\n      Sens about 1230, and a rival one undertaken by the Mendicant Orders,\r\n      through Cardinal Hugo de St. Caro (_see_ above, p. 69), and adopted\r\n      by their general Chapter held at Paris in 1256. A previous revision\r\n      had been made by Cardinal Nicolaus and the Cistercian Abbot\r\n      Stephanus in 1150. A manuscript of that of 1256 was used by Lucas\r\n      Brugensis and Simon (Wetstein, N. T. Prol. vol. i. p. 85).

Ravianus, Bibl. Reg. Berolinensis [xvi], 4to, 2 vols., on\r\n      parchment, once belonging to Jo. Rave of Upsal, has been examined by\r\n      Wetstein, Griesbach, and by G. G. Pappelbaum in 1796. It contains\r\n      the whole New Testament, and has attracted attention because it has\r\n      the disputed words in 1 John v. 7, 8. It is now, however, admitted\r\n      by all to be a mere transcript of the N. T. in the Complutensian\r\n      Polyglott with variations from Erasmus or Stephen, and as such has\r\n      no independent authority.\r\n\r\n  241 (Wetstein.) THE VELESIAN READINGS. The Jesuit de la Cerda in his\r\n      “Adversaria Sacra,” cap. xci (Lyons, 1626), a collection of various\r\n      readings, written in vermilion in the margin of a _Greek_ Testament\r\n      (which from its misprint in 1 Pet. iii. 11 we know to be R.\r\n      Stephen’s of 1550) by Petro Faxardo, Marquis of Velez, a Spaniard,\r\n      who had taken them from sixteen manuscripts, eight of which were in\r\n      the king’s library, in the Escurial. It is never stated what codices\r\n      or how many support each variation. De la Cerda had received the\r\n      readings from Mariana, the great Jesuit historian of Spain, then\r\n      lately dead, and appears to have inadvertently added to Mariana’s\r\n      account of their origin, that the sixteen manuscripts were in Greek.\r\n      These Velesian readings, though suspected from the first even by\r\n      Mariana by reason of their strange resemblance to the Latin Vulgate\r\n      and the manuscripts of the Old Latin, were repeated as critical\r\n      authorities in Walton’s Polyglott, 1657, and (contrary to his own\r\n      better judgement) were retained by Mill in 1707. Wetstein, however\r\n      (N. T. Proleg. vol. i. pp. 59-61), and after him Michaelis and Bp.\r\n      Marsh, have abundantly proved that the various readings must have\r\n      been collected by Velez from _Latin_ manuscripts, and by him\r\n      translated into Greek, very foolishly perhaps, but not of necessity\r\n      with a fraudulent design. Certainly, any little weight the Velesian\r\n      readings may have, must be referred to the Latin, not to the Greek\r\n      text. Among the various proofs of their Latin origin urged by\r\n      Wetstein and others, the following establish the fact beyond the\r\n      possibility of doubt:\r\n\r\n      (For each of these, there is the reference, the Greek Text, the\r\n      Vulgate Text, the Vulgate various reading, and the Velesian\r\n      reading.)\r\n\r\n      Mark viii. 38; ἐπαισχυνθῇ; confusus fuerit; confessus fuerit;\r\n      ὁμολογήσῃ;\r\n      Heb. xii. 18; κεκαυμένῳ; accensibilem; accessibilem; προσίτῳ;\r\n      ——xiii. 2; ἔλαθον; latuerunt; placuerunt; ἤρεσαν;\r\n      James v. 6; κατεδικάσατε; addixistis; adduxistis; ἠγάγετε;\r\n      Apoc. xix. 6; ὄχλου; turbae; tubae; σάλπιγγος;\r\n      ——xxi. 12; ἀγγέλους; angelos; angelos; γωνίας.\r\n\r\n  242 (Wetstein.) THE BARBERINI READINGS must also be banished from our\r\n      list of critical authorities, though for a different reason. The\r\n      collection of various readings from twenty-two manuscripts (ten of\r\n      the Gospels, eight of the Acts and Epistles, and four of the\r\n      Apocalypse), seen by Isaac Vossius in 1642 in the Barberini Library\r\n      at Rome, was made about 1625, and first published in 1673 by Peter\r\n      Possinus (Poussines), a Jesuit, at the end of a catena of St. Mark.\r\n      He alleged that the collations were made by John M. Caryophilus [d.\r\n      1635], a Cretan, while preparing an edition of the Greek Testament,\r\n      under the patronage of Paul V [d. 1621] and Urban VIII [d. 1644]. As\r\n      the Barberini readings often favour the Latin version, they fell\r\n      into the same suspicion as the Velesian: Wetstein especially (N. T.\r\n      Proleg. vol. i. pp. 61, 62), after pressing against them some\r\n      objections more ingenious than solid, declares “lis haec non aliter\r\n      quam ipsis libris Romae inventis et productis, _quod nunquam credo\r\n      fiet_, solvi potest.” The very papers Wetstein thus called for were\r\n      discovered by Birch (Barberini Lib. 209) more than thirty years\r\n      later, and besides them Caryophilus’ petition for the loan of six\r\n      manuscripts from the Vatican (Codd. BS, 127, 129, 141, 144), which\r\n      he doubtless obtained and used. The good faith of the collator being\r\n      thus happily vindicated, we have only to identify his eleven [Cod.\r\n      141 of the Gospels being also Act. 75, Paul. 86, Apoc. 40. Another\r\n      of his manuscripts was Act. 73, Paul. 80.] remaining codices, most\r\n      of them probably being in that very Library, and may then dismiss\r\n      the Barberini readings as having done their work, and been fairly\r\n      superseded.\r\n\r\n  243 In Codd. 115 and 202 _Eus._ is usually, in Codd. 116, 117, 417, 422,\r\n      and B. M. Addit. 15,581 but rarely, written under _Am._: these\r\n      copies therefore were probably never quite finished. See p. 62, and\r\n      note 1.\r\n\r\n  244 Meerman’s other manuscript of the N. T., sold at his sale in 1824,\r\n      is No. 562.\r\n\r\n  245 A collection presented to Urban VIII (1623-44) by Maximilian,\r\n      Elector of Bavaria, from the spoils of the unhappy Elector Palatine,\r\n      titular king of Bohemia.\r\n\r\n  246 Or rather A.D. 1274. According to Engelbreth the letters stand\r\n      ψτψπβ, which can only mean A.M. 6782 (_see_ p. 42, note 2).\r\n\r\n  247 Thus, at least, I understand Moldenhawer’s description, “Evangeliis\r\n      et Actis λέξεις subjiciuntur dudum in vulgus notae.”\r\n\r\n  248 Others F.\r\n\r\n  249 By double _syn._ Moldenhawer may be supposed to mean here and in\r\n      Cod. 232 both _syn._ and _men._\r\n\r\n  250 Readings extracted by Griesbach (Symb. Crit. i. pp. 247-304) from\r\n      the margin of a copy of Mill’s Greek Testament in the Bodleian, in\r\n      his own or Thomas Hearne’s handwriting, were placed here, but are\r\n      omitted. Scrivener (Cod. Augiensis, Introd. p. xxxvi) has shown that\r\n      they were derived from Evan. 440.\r\n\r\n  251 Holmes, Praefatio ad Pentateuchum, describes his Cod. 32 as “e\r\n      Codicibus Eugenii, olim Archiepiscopi Slabinii et Chersonis.”\r\n      Nicephorus also is named by Holmes as the editor of a Catena on the\r\n      Octateuch and the four books of Kings from the Constantinopolitan\r\n      manuscripts (Leipzig, 1772-3), and is described as “primo\r\n      Hieromonachus, et postea Archiepiscopus Slabiniensis et\r\n      Chersonensis, sedem Astracani habens” (_ubi supra_, cap. iv).\r\n\r\n  252 Written in three several and minute hands (Hort):—A for the Gospels,\r\n      the Epistle of Pilate and its Answer, and a treatise on the\r\n      genealogy of the Virgin; B for the Apocalypse and a Synaxarion; C\r\n      the Acts, Cath. Paul. (Hebrews last), and Lives of the Apostles,\r\n      followed on the same page by the Psalter by B, so that Apoc. and\r\n      _syn._ probably stood last.\r\n\r\n  253 This manuscript appears to be the only Greek witness for the Old\r\n      Latin and Curetonian Syriac variation Matt. i. 16 ἰωσὴφ ᾧ\r\n      μνηστευθῆσα παρθένος μαριὰμ ἐγέννησεν _ιν_ τὸν λεγόμενον _χν_. But\r\n      then it was written in Italy, as Ceriani judges.\r\n\r\n  254 The asper or asprum was a mediaeval Greek silver coin (derived from\r\n      ἄσπρος, _albus_); we may infer its value from a passage cited by\r\n      Ducange from Vincentius Bellovac. xxx. 75 “quindecim drachmas seu\r\n      asperos.”\r\n\r\n  255 450.

G. W. Kitchin’s Catalogue of the Manuscripts\r\n      in Christ Church Library (4to, 1867).\r\n\r\n  258 The letter χ is quite illegible, but the Indiction 9 belongs only to\r\n      A.D. 831, 1131, 1431, while the style of the manuscript leaves no\r\n      doubt which to choose.\r\n\r\n  259 Of these manuscripts Thomas Mangey (Evan. 483) states on the\r\n      fly-leaves that he collated Nos. 12, 25, 28, 34 in 1749. Caspar\r\n      Wetstein collated the Apocalypse in Nos. 12 and 34 for his\r\n      relative’s great edition; while in the margin of No. 35, a 4to Greek\r\n      Testament printed at Geneva (1620), is inserted a most laborious\r\n      collation (preceded by a full description) of eight of the Wake\r\n      manuscripts with Wetstein’s N. T. of 1711, having this title\r\n      prefixed to them, “Hae Variae lectiones ex MSS. notatae sunt manu et\r\n      opera Johannis Walkeri, A. 1732.” John Walker, most of whose labours\r\n      seem never yet to have been used, although they were known to\r\n      Berriman in 1741 (Critical Dissertation on 1 Tim. iii. 16, pp.\r\n      102-4), was Fellow of Trinity College, Cambridge, where so many of\r\n      his critical materials accumulated for the illustrious Bentley are\r\n      deposited. Walker d. 1741, Archdeacon of Hereford, after Bentley’s\r\n      will, six months before him. The codd. in Trinity College were\r\n      bought from Bentley’s heirs (not from Richard Bentley) when\r\n      Wordsworth was Master (1820-41), and so were not in Bentley’s hands\r\n      when Walker died. Old Latin Biblical Texts, xxiv-vi. Of his eight\r\n      codices, we find on investigation that Walker’s C is Wake 26;\r\n      Walker’s 1 is Wake 20 (collations of these two, sent by Walker to\r\n      Wetstein, comprise Codd. 73, 74, described above); Walker’s B is\r\n      Wake 21; Walker’s D is Wake 24, both of Gospels; Walker’s E is Wake\r\n      18, his H is Wake 19, both Evangelistaria; Walker’s q is Wake 12, of\r\n      which Caspar Wetstein afterwards examined the Apocalypse (Cod. 26);\r\n      Walker’s W is Wake 38 of the Acts and Epistles, or Scholz’s Act.\r\n      191, Paul. 245.\r\n\r\n  260 Bentley specifies “argumenta inedita Cosmae Indicopleustae in 4\r\n      Evangelia, et versus iambici fortasse Jacobi Calligraphi: argumenta\r\n      incerti ad Actus: prologus ineditus et argumenta Oecumenii ad\r\n      Epistolas omnes.”\r\n\r\n  261 Matt. iv. 1-vii. 6; xx. 21-xxi. 12; Luke iv. 29-v. 1; 17-33; xvi.\r\n      24-xvii. 13; xx. 19-41; John vi. 51-viii. 2; xii. 20-40; xiv. 27-xv.\r\n      13; xvii. 6-xviii. 2; 37-xix. 14.\r\n\r\n  262 In Mr. Coxe’s “Report to Her Majesty’s Government,” we find an\r\n      account (which illness compelled him to give at second hand) of\r\n      several copies of the Gospels and one palimpsest Evangelistarium,\r\n      all dated [xii], still remaining in this Prelate’s Library.\r\n\r\n  263 For Add. 11,837, which is mscr, see Evan. *201.\r\n\r\n  264 Belsheim (Cod. Aureus, Proleg. p. xvii and note 3) gives a short\r\n      life of that noble Swede, John Gabriel Sparvenfeldt [1655-1727], who\r\n      was sent over Europe by his master, Charles XI, to procure\r\n      manuscripts for the Royal Library, and bought the Latin Codex Aureus\r\n      at Madrid in 1690.\r\n\r\n  265 Gregory considers this to be (not a duplicate but) the same as Cod.\r\n      634.\r\n\r\n  266 For the other Evann. at Patmos, _see_ No. 1160, &c.\r\n\r\n  267 For all these MSS. (Evann. 1148, 1149, 1261, 1262, 1263, 1265-1268,\r\n      1274-1279), _see_ Ἱεροσολομιτικὴ Βιβλιοθήκη, κ.τ.λ., ὑπὸ Α.\r\n      Παπαδοπούλου Π. Κεραμέως. Τόμος Πρῶτος. Ἐν Πετρουπόλει, 1891.\r\n\r\n  268 Mr. Ellis (Bentleii Critica Sacra, pp. xxviii, xxix) represents,\r\n      among facts which I am better able to verify, that Act. and Epp. 25,\r\n      26, and Epp. 15, were collated by Wetstein, and his labours\r\n      preserved at Trin. Coll. Cambridge (B. xvii. 10, 11). The\r\n      manuscripts he indicates so ambiguously must be Paul. 25, 26, and\r\n      Act. 15, since Wetstein is not known to have worked at Act. 25, 26,\r\n      or Paul. 15.\r\n\r\n  269 Covell once marked this codex 5, but afterwards gave it the name of\r\n      the Sinai MS. (little anticipating worthier claimants for that\r\n      appellation), reserving 5 for Harl. 5777 or Evan. 446.\r\n\r\n_  270 See_ under 98.\r\n\r\n  271 Cod. 162 has attracted much attention from the circumstance that it\r\n      is the only unsuspected witness among the Greek manuscripts for the\r\n      celebrated text 1 John v. 7, 8, whose authenticity will be discussed\r\n      in Vol. II. Ch. XII. A facsimile of the passage in question was\r\n      traced in 1829 by Cardinal Wiseman for Bishop Burgess, and published\r\n      by Horne in several editions of his “Introduction,” as also by\r\n      Tregelles (Horne, vol. iv. p. 217). If the facsimile is at all\r\n      faithful, this is as rudely and indistinctly written as any\r\n      manuscript in existence; but the illegible scrawl between the Latin\r\n      column in the post of honour on the left, and the Greek column on\r\n      the right, has been ascertained by Mr. B. H. Alford (who examined\r\n      the codex at Tregelles’ request) to be merely a consequence of the\r\n      accidental shifting of the tracing paper, too servilely copied by\r\n      the engraver.\r\n\r\n  272 Scholz says 1344, and Tischendorf corrects but few of his gross\r\n      errors in these Catalogues: but A.M. 6902, which he cites from the\r\n      manuscript, is A.D. 1394.\r\n\r\n  273 Here again we banish to the notes Scholz’s list from Cod. 182 to\r\n      Cod. 189, for the reasons stated after Evan. 449.\r\n\r\n      182. (Paul. 243.) Library of St. John’s monastery at Patmos [xii],\r\n      8vo, also another [xiii] 8vo.\r\n\r\n      183. (Paul. 231.) Library of the Great Greek monastery at Jerusalem\r\n      8 [xiv], 8vo. This must be Coxe’s No. 7 [x], 4to, beginning Acts\r\n      xii. 6.\r\n\r\n      184. (Paul. 232, Apoc. 85.) Jerusalem 9 [xiii], 4to, with a\r\n      commentary. This is evidently Coxe’s No. 15, though he dates it at\r\n      the end of [x].\r\n\r\n      185. (Paul. 233.) St. Saba, Greek monastery, 1 [xi], 12mo.\r\n\r\n      186. (Evan. 457.)\r\n\r\n      187. (Evan. 462.)\r\n\r\n      188. (Paul. 236.) St. Saba 15 [xii], 4to.\r\n\r\n      189. (Evan. 466.)\r\n\r\n  274 From the monastery of Grotta Ferrata, near Tusculum, “Ubi degunt ab\r\n      antiquo tempore monachi, ordinis S. Basilii Magni, ritum\r\n      Italo-Graecum observantes,” Holmes. Praef. ad Pentateuch. on his\r\n      Cod. 128, which came to the Vatican from the same place. It is the\r\n      traditional Villa Luculli.\r\n\r\n  275 Birch shows the connexion of Caryophilus with this important copy\r\n      (which much resembles the Leicester manuscript, Evan. Cod. 69) from\r\n      James v. 5, and especially from 3 John 5 μισθόν for πιστόν, a\r\n      _lectio singularis_. In this codex, as in the others cited, Heb.\r\n      stands before 1 Tim.\r\n\r\n  276 The gold ducat coined for the Military Order of St. John at Rhodes\r\n      (_see_ Ducange) was worth 9_s_. 6_d_. English money.\r\n\r\n  277 Here again we set Scholz’s codices in a note, substituting others in\r\n      their room. Scholz’s run, 231. (Act. 183.) 232. (Act. 184.) 233.\r\n      (Act. 185.) 234. (Evan. 457.) 235. (Evan. 462.) 236. (Act. 188.)\r\n      237. (Evan. 466.) 243. (Act. 182), two separate codices.\r\n\r\n  278 Mr. B. W. Newton superintended the publication of Tregelles’ last\r\n      part of his Greek New Testament under circumstances which disarm\r\n      criticism, but Tregelles could hardly have meant that in the\r\n      Apocalypse “much of Cod. 14 (Leicestrensis) has been supplied by a\r\n      later hand from the Codex Montfortianus, Apoc. 92” (Introductory\r\n      Notice, p. 1). The original hand remains unchanged in the Leicester\r\n      copy, even on the last torn leaf containing portions of Apoc. xix,\r\n      but the converse supposition is very maintainable, though not quite\r\n      certain, that the Apocalypse in Cod. 92 was transcribed from Cod.\r\n      14.\r\n\r\n  279 Gregory has substituted this for Scholz’s 23, which he finds does\r\n      not contain Apoc. Whatever readings he cites under these three\r\n      numbers, are simply copied from Wetstein (Kelly’s “Revelation,”\r\n      Introd. p. xi, note). Dr. Gregory has seen all the four.\r\n\r\n  280 After this again we withdraw Scholz’s copies, as virtually included\r\n      in Coxe’s, putting others in their room. They are 85. (Act. 184.)\r\n      86. (Evan. 462), thrice cited ineunte libro (Tischendorf). 862 of\r\n      Scholz, being 89 of Tischendorf (Evan. 466).\r\n\r\n  281 We cannot identify 109, Bentley’s R (Regis Galliae, 1872): cf.\r\n      Ellis, Bentleii Critica Sacra, Intr. p. xxix.\r\n\r\n  282 In the sixth lesson for the Holy Passions the prefatory clause to\r\n      Mark xv. 16 is founded on an obvious misconception: Τῷ καιρῷ ἐκείνῳ\r\n      οἱ στρατιῶται ἀπήγαγον τὸν ϊν εἰς τὴν ἀυλὴν τοῦ καϊάφα, ὅ ἐστι\r\n      πραιτώριον. We remember no similar instance of error.\r\n\r\n  283 Laud. Gr. 36, which in the Bodleian Catalogue is described as an\r\n      Evangelistarium, is a collection of Church Lessons from the\r\n      Septuagint read in Lent and the Holy Week, such as we described\r\n      above. It has red musical notes, and seems _once_ to have borne the\r\n      date A.D. 1028. It is Dean Holmes’ No. 61 (Praef. ad Pentateuch).\r\n\r\n  284 As with the MSS. of the Gospels, and for the reasons assigned above,\r\n      we remove to the foot of the page, and do not reckon in our\r\n      numbering, the twenty-one copies seen by Scholz in Eastern\r\n      Libraries.\r\n\r\n      158. Library of the Great Greek Monastery at Jerusalem, No. 10\r\n      [xiv], fol.\r\n\r\n      159. “Biblioth. monasterii virginum τῆς μεγάλης παναγίας a S. Melana\r\n      erect.” [xiii], fol., very neat (“non sec. viii ut monachi putant,”\r\n      Scholz).\r\n\r\n      160. (Apost. 33.) St. Saba 4, written there by one Antony [xiv],\r\n      8vo.\r\n\r\n      161. St. Saba 5 [xv], 8vo, _chart._\r\n\r\n      162. St. Saba 6 [xv], 16mo, _chart._\r\n\r\n      163. St. Saba 13 [xiii], 4to, _chart._, adapted (as also those that\r\n      follow) to the use of Palestine.\r\n\r\n      164. St. Saba [xiv], 4to.\r\n\r\n      165. St. Saba 17 [xv], 4to, _chart._\r\n\r\n      166. St. Saba 21 [xiii], fol.\r\n\r\n      167. St. Saba 22 [xiv], fol.\r\n\r\n      168. St. Saba 23 [xiii], fol.\r\n\r\n      169. St. Saba 24 [xiii], fol.\r\n\r\n      170. St. Saba 25 [xiii], fol.\r\n\r\n      171. (Apost. 52.) St. Saba (unnumbered) [written July, 1059, in the\r\n      monastery of Θεοτόκος, by Sergius, a monk of Olympus in Bithynia],\r\n      8vo.\r\n\r\n      [+]172. Library of St. John’s monastery at Patmos [“iv” Scholz,\r\n      obviously a misprint], fol.\r\n\r\n      [+]173. Patmos [ix], 4to.\r\n\r\n      [+]174. Patm. [x], 4to.\r\n\r\n      [+]175. Patm. [x], 4to.\r\n\r\n      176. Patm. [xii], 4to.\r\n\r\n      177. Patm. [xiii], 4to.\r\n\r\n      178. Patm. [xiv], 4to, in the same Library, but not numbered.\r\n\r\n      Some of these MSS. have been removed to Europe since Scholz made his\r\n      reckoning, e.g. Parham No. 20 (Evst. 236).\r\n\r\n  285 At the end in small gold uncials the following very curious colophon\r\n      was deciphered by Dean Burgon and the learned sub-librarian Signor\r\n      Veludo jointly: Μηνὶ μαΐω Ἰνδ. ΙΔ. ἔτους ϛφνδ᾽. προσηνέχθη παρὰ\r\n      βασιλείου μοναχοῦ πρεσβυτέρου καὶ ἡγουμένου τῆς σεβασμίας μονῆς τῆς\r\n      κοιμήσεως τῆς θ_κου_ εἰς τὴν ἀυτὴν μονὴν βιβλία τέσσαρα; τὸ\r\n      ἀυτὸεὐαγγέλιον, ἀπόστολος, προφητεία, καὶ ἀναγνοστικόν, ὁ βίος τοῦ\r\n      ἁγίου. καὶ ἐστύχηται δίδωσθαι ὑπὲρ τῆς αὐτῆς προσενέξαιως ἑνὶ ἑκάστω\r\n      χρόνω ἀπὸ τοῦ δοχείου τῆς αὐτῆς μονῆς ὑπὲρ μνήμης αὐτ νόμισμα ἒν\r\n      ἥμισον, μέχ[ρι γὰρ τού] τὰ τῶν χριστιανῶν [συ]νίσταται;\r\n      περιφυλάττεται δὲ καὶ ἡ ἁγία μονὴ αὕτη; ἐν γὰρ τῶ τυπικῶ τῆς μονῆς\r\n      περὶ τοῦ κατίδους (_sic_) τῶν ἀυτῆς βιβλίων, καὶ περὶ τῆς διανομῆς\r\n      τοῦ ἑνὸς ἡμίσου νομίσματος σαφέστερον διερμηνεύει.\r\n\r\n  286 Thus 222, with only two other Evangelistaria (6, 13) and Evan. 59 by\r\n      the first hand, supports Cod. א and Eusebius in the significant\r\n      omission of υἱοῦ βαραχίον, Matt. xxiii. 35.\r\n\r\n  287 [+]Evan. Td and Te and Λ (1) should also properly be classed as\r\n      Lectionaries. Apost. 15, and perhaps Apost. 24, also contains\r\n      Lessons from the Gospels. The two copies of the Gospels, Lowes\r\n      formerly Askew, membr. 4to, mentioned by Scholz (N. T., vol. i. p.\r\n      cxix), and stated by Marsh on Michaelis, vol. ii. p. 662, to have\r\n      been bought at Askew’s sale by Mr. Lowes, the bookseller, are shown\r\n      by the sale catalogue to have Evangelistaria. They have not yet been\r\n      traced. (Ed. 3.)\r\n\r\n  288 In 1721. _See_ Monk’s “Life of Bentley,” vol. ii. p. 149. This is\r\n      Bentley’s O, John Walker’s collation of which is preserved at Trin.\r\n      Coll. (B. xvii. 34). Ellis, Bentleii Critica Sacra, Introd. pp.\r\n      xxix, xxx.\r\n\r\n  289 As in our preceding lists, we remove to this foot-note Scholz’s six\r\n      copies seen at St. Saba, and occupy their numbers by other\r\n      manuscripts. They are Apost. 49. St. Saba 16 [xiv], 4to, _chart._\r\n      50. St. Saba 18 [xv], 8vo. 51. St. Saba 26 [xiv], fol. 52. (Evst.\r\n      171.) 53. (Evst. 160.) 54. St. Saba (unnumbered) [xiii], 4to.\r\n\r\n  290 An independent mode of reckoning the commencement of the indiction\r\n      was followed in Egypt under the later Roman Empire. The indiction\r\n      there began normally in the latter half of the month Pauni, which\r\n      corresponds to about the middle of June; but the actual day of\r\n      commencement appears to have been variable and to have depended upon\r\n      the exact period of the rising of the Nile.—“Catalogue of Greek\r\n      Papyri in the British Museum,” pp. 197, 198.\r\n\r\n  291 So Scholz’s index, and we may suppose correctly, but in his\r\n      Catalogue of Evangelistaria he numbers it 1256.",
