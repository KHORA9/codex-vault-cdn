THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY\r\n\r\n    There is an evil worse than war and that is the debasement\r\n    of peoples. The wounds of war may be healed, but moral\r\n    degradation leads nations to the tomb. During the peace that\r\n    followed the battle of Villmergen up to the time of the French\r\n    revolution Switzerland suffered more calamities than in all\r\n    the wars against Burgundy and Austria. For during the eighty\r\n    years of repose during which the swords of the Winckelrieds,\r\n    the Fontanas, the Halhwyls, and the Erlachs were tarnishing,\r\n    the rust of egoism and of pride succeeded in eating away the\r\n    tablets on which was engraven the loyal union of the ancient\r\n    Swiss; and like a corpse the old confederation was rotting\r\n    away. In vain degenerate sons decorated pompously the corpse of\r\n    the achievements of their ancestors, that they might conceal\r\n    the fact that the spirit which animated it aforetime had left\r\n    it.--ZSCHOKKE.[b]\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CONSPIRACY OF HENTZI; THE INSURRECTION AT FRIBOURG\r\n\r\nThe outward peace enjoyed by the confederacy during the eighteenth\r\ncentury (the last of its existence in its primitive form) was contrasted\r\nby incessant inward disturbances. The first of these which claims our\r\nattention is the conspiracy of Hentzi at Bern. Here, as in most towns of\r\nthe confederacy, a more and more formal and regular aristocracy had grown\r\nup by degrees in the course of centuries. From time immemorial the powers\r\nof government had been held by the avoyer and council. For the protection\r\nof the burghers against the encroachments of the council, and of that\r\nbody against the influence of the multitude, an assembly of two hundred\r\nof the most respectable burghers was formed, the members of which were\r\nannually elected.\r\n\r\nThe most important acts, which imposed duties on every burgher, not only\r\nfor himself but for his posterity, were often brought before the whole\r\nbody of citizens, and even country people; the more so as at that time\r\na few villages constituted the whole domain of Bern. The continual\r\naggrandisement of the state rendered obsolete the fundamental laws of\r\nits constitution, which became imperceptibly modified in proportion as\r\npolitical emergencies appeared to require alterations. When the power\r\nof Bern was doubled by the conquest of the Vaud, the assembly of the\r\nburghers ceased to be thought of. The dignities of the state became\r\nhereditary in those families which had once obtained a seat in the\r\ngreat council. It is true that the other burghers remained eligible to\r\npublic functions; but it was rarely indeed, and generally by means of\r\nintermarriages, that a new family raised itself to the rank of the rulers\r\n_de facto_.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [1743-1749 A.D.]]\r\n\r\nThe administration of these ruling families was, in general, not devoid\r\nof wisdom and equity; and, in fact, the principal subject of complaint\r\nwas that participation in state affairs had ceased to be open to all. It\r\nwas, however, precisely this system of aristocratic exclusion which was\r\nfelt so insupportably by many of those who were subjected to it, that so\r\nearly as 1710 attempts were made to break it up. These were renewed with\r\nincreased vigour, in 1743, by six and twenty burghers, who combined to\r\npetition the council for the revival of a greater equality of rights in\r\nfavour of the general body of citizens. These adventurous men incurred\r\nthe censure of the authorities, and were placed under arrest in their\r\nhouses or banished.\r\n\r\nAmongst the exiles was Samuel Hentzi, a man of no ordinary talent and\r\nspirit. He had fixed on Neuchâtel as the place of his banishment; the\r\nterm of which was shortened by the favour of the authorities. On his\r\nreturn, the embarrassed state in which he found his domestic economy,\r\nand the ill success of his efforts to obtain a lucrative office, may\r\nhave mingled with other motives in inducing him to take the lead in a\r\ndesperate undertaking of a little band of malcontents, who, without\r\nmoney, arms, or even unity of purpose, dreamed of overturning a\r\ngovernment strong in its own resources, and sure of support from the\r\nwhole Helvetic body, and of instituting equality of rights among all\r\nburghers, and appointment to all offices by lot. Yet, with all their\r\nroot and branch work, the conspirators had no idea of remedying the\r\nreal defects of the state, of satisfying the prevalent and increasing\r\ndiscontents of the Vaud, or of procuring an extension of political\r\nrights to the whole people: for, in the plan of a constitution annexed\r\nto their mediated manifesto, exclusive regard was paid to the burghers\r\nat Bern; and the rest of the people would hardly have been bettered by\r\ntheir accession to the dignities which had hitherto been engrossed by the\r\nruling families. The 13th of July, 1749, was fixed for the execution of\r\nthe plans of the conspirators; but many of their own number had opened\r\ntheir eyes by this time to the utter impossibility of success, produced\r\nby the disunion and imprudence of their colleagues--to the passion\r\nand cupidity of some, and the atrocious hopes of murder and plunder\r\nentertained by others.\r\n\r\nNo man felt more sensibly the criminal views of his party than the only\r\nman of ability and public spirit among them, Hentzi. He would not betray\r\nthose with whom he had long pursued the same object; but he made an\r\nattempt to save himself by flight from further participation in their\r\nplans and foreseen destiny. It was too late: a betrayer had already\r\ndone his work. Hentzi and other leaders of the party were taken and\r\nbeheaded during the first exasperation of the government. Sentence of\r\ndeath was also pronounced upon some who had made their escape; others\r\nwere imprisoned or banished, but soon afterwards pardoned. On embarking\r\nwith her two sons to quit the Helvetic territory, the wife of Hentzi\r\nexclaimed, “I would rather see these children sink in the Rhine-stream\r\nthan they should not one day learn to avenge the murder of their\r\nfather.” However, when the sons came to manhood, they displayed more\r\nmagnanimity than their mother; and one of them, who rose to distinction\r\nin the service of the Netherlands, requited with good offices to the\r\nburghers of his native town the unmerited misfortunes which they had\r\nbrought upon his family.\r\n\r\nIn Fribourg--where, in olden times, equality of rights for all burghers\r\nhad been settled as a principle--a no less close aristocracy had formed\r\nitself than in Bern, since the middle of the seventeenth century. A few\r\nhouses, under the denomination of secret families, had contrived to\r\nexclude, not only the country people, but a large proportion likewise\r\nof the town burghers, from all participation in public affairs; and, in\r\n1684, admission into the number of these secret families was rendered\r\nwholly impossible. From thenceforwards, constantly increasing discontent\r\ndisplayed itself both in town and country. Several very moderate\r\nproposals for alleviating the pressure of this oligarchy were rejected\r\nwith such haughtiness by the government, that disaffection swelled into\r\nrevolt.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [1781 A.D.]]\r\n\r\nIn 1781 Peter Nicholas Chenaux of la Tour de Trême, John Peter Raccaud,\r\nand an advocate of Gruyères of the name of Castellaz, formed a league for\r\nthe achievement of a higher degree of freedom. First they endeavoured\r\nto work upon the people by fair promises. Then Chenaux, at the head of\r\na select band of fifty or sixty, undertook to terrify the government\r\ninto a compromise. But the gates being closed on the party, and the\r\nwalls manned with armed burghers, this undertaking ended in open revolt.\r\nThe toll of alarm-bells summoned up the country people from every hill\r\nand valley in the canton to assist in the coercion of the domineering\r\ncapital. A body of nearly three thousand men encamped before the walls\r\nof Fribourg, and further aid was hourly expected. The terrified burghers\r\ninstantly called for the armed intervention of Bern, and the latter\r\ntown detached a part of its guard without delay. Three hundred dragoons\r\nmarched upon Fribourg, and were to be followed by fourteen hundred foot.\r\nThe burghers of Fribourg now thought themselves strong enough to meet\r\nforce with force. The garrison made a sally from the town, and on the\r\nfirst sight of the Bernese flag, not to mention the heavy artillery,\r\nthe malcontents solicited an armistice. The surrender of their arms and\r\nof the ringleaders was demanded as preliminary to all negotiation. The\r\npeople refused the latter of these conditions, but fled panic-struck on\r\nthe first attack, without making any resistance.\r\n\r\nThe whole affair would have ended without bloodshed, had not the leader\r\nChenaux been murdered in his flight by Henry Rosier, himself one of the\r\npopular party. The two remaining heads of the insurgents got clear off:\r\nChenaux’s corpse was delivered to the public executioner, and his head\r\nfixed on a spear above the Romont gate. Sentence of death was passed on\r\nCastellaz and Raccaud, the two fugitives. Several others were visited\r\nwith less degrees of punishment: new reinforcements from Bern, Solothurn,\r\nand Lucerne secured the town from any recurrence of tumult, and their\r\nambassadors strove to promote the restoration of tranquillity. It was\r\nordered to be proclaimed, from all the pulpits, that the council was\r\nwell disposed to protect the old and well attested rights of its loving\r\nsubjects, as well as to hear, with its never-failing graciousness, every\r\nsuitable and respectful representation. Three days were allotted to\r\neach commune to lay their complaints and wishes before the government,\r\nthrough delegates. But when months elapsed without the popular grievances\r\nhaving obtained a hearing, the loss of Chenaux began to be appreciated.\r\nMultitudes assembled round his tomb weeping and praying: pilgrimages,\r\nas if to the tomb of a saint, were made thither with banners, and with\r\ncrucifixes. Vainly were these demonstrations of feeling stigmatised,\r\nby the government as crime against the state, by the bishop as impious\r\nprofanations. They were neither to be checked by posting sentinels, nor\r\nfulminating excommunications. They were the last sad consolation of the\r\npeople--the last substitute for hopes that were already given up.\r\n\r\n\r\nDISORDERS AT GENEVA (1707-1782 A.D.)\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [1707-1714 A.D.]]\r\n\r\nShortly after the establishment of Genevan independence, it had been\r\ndecreed by the general assembly, for the better suppression of hostile\r\nattempts against their hard-won freedom, that whoever should propose\r\na change in the government of Geneva should be considered to deserve\r\ncapital punishment. This did not, however, hinder alterations being made,\r\nat different times, in various parts of the constitution. So early as\r\nthe middle of the sixteenth century, the laws were revised and improved.\r\nThe advantageous situation of the town and the long duration of peace\r\npromoted the increase of wealth in Geneva, and the rise of many families\r\nto opulence. These families aimed at separating themselves from their\r\nfellow citizens, even in their places of habitation, by settling in the\r\nupper part of the town, near the council-house, while the other burghers\r\ninhabited the lower town. The principal families already regarded\r\nthemselves as a standing patriciate; and even the name of patrician came\r\ninto use in the acts of council.\r\n\r\nThe year 1707 witnessed an effort of the inferior burghers to wrest from\r\nthe principal families a part of their usurped power, and to introduce\r\namendments in the constitution. In this emergency, the council invoked\r\nthe mediation of Bern and Zurich, received a confederate garrison, and\r\nmaintained itself by force of arms and by execution of its principal\r\nantagonists. A renewal of the disturbances which had been quelled by\r\nsuch violent measures, was produced, in 1714, by the imposition of\r\nan arbitrary tax by the council for the enlargement and completion\r\nof the fortifications of the town. This stretch of power occasioned\r\ngreat discontent among the burghers; bitter attacks and censures on\r\nthe government appeared in print; and the more strictly these were\r\nprohibited, they obtained the more eager perusal and credence.\r\n\r\nOne of the arch-promoters of the rising storm was Michael Ducrest, a\r\nGenevan burgher and noble, an officer in the army, and a member of the\r\ngreat council. This man opposed himself with extraordinary vehemence to\r\nthe building of the new fortifications, and heaped offensive charges\r\non the partisans of the measure. The government condemned him to\r\nrecant, and, on his evading compliance by flight, a penal sentence was\r\npronounced against him. New attempts which he made to excite disturbance\r\nwere followed by a sentence of perpetual imprisonment. This sentence\r\ncould not be put in execution, as Ducrest had taken refuge under a\r\nforeign jurisdiction, where he set at defiance the council of Geneva,\r\nand provoked that body to such a degree by his writings and intrigues\r\nagainst them, that sentences more and more severe were heaped upon his\r\nhead, until at length the most offensive of his writings was torn by\r\nthe hangman, and his effigy was suspended from the gallows. His person,\r\nhowever, enjoyed impunity till 1744, when he was taken into custody in\r\nthe territory of Bern. The government of Geneva did not thirst for his\r\nblood, and was content with his perpetual imprisonment. Even in this\r\nsituation he contrived to mix in Hentzi’s conspiracy, was confined in the\r\ncastle of Aarburg, and closed, in extreme old age, as a state prisoner,\r\na life which he had spent in incessant labours in the cause of democracy.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [1734-1738 A.D.]]\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Geneva continued to be agitated by party manœuvres and popular\r\ndiscontents. In the year 1734 a body of eight hundred burghers addressed\r\nthemselves to the heads of the government, desiring the curtailment\r\nof the projected fortifications, and the repeal of the tax levied for\r\nthat object. The council only replied by preparations for defence:\r\nfirearms were transported to the council hall; barricades erected in\r\nthe approaches thither as well as in those to the upper town, where the\r\nprincipal class of burghers lived, and the garrison kept in readiness to\r\nact on the first signal. All this apparatus was regarded with mistrust by\r\nthe burghers, who were still farther provoked by reports of the approach\r\nof Bernese troops, and by the removal of a part of the town artillery to\r\nthe upper regions, while two and twenty other pieces were spiked. The\r\nmultitude made themselves masters of the city guard, pointed field-pieces\r\non the road by which the troops from Bern were expected, and tumultuously\r\ndemanded the convocation of the burgher assembly, the sovereign authority\r\nof Geneva. The council contrived to win over the members of this body so\r\nfar that they voted unanimously the completion of the fortifications and\r\nthe continuance of the tax for ten years. The declaration of an amnesty\r\nand improvement of the criminal and judicial administration formed the\r\nrest of their business. The burghers laid down their arms and returned to\r\ntheir ordinary vocations; so that an embassy which arrived from Zurich\r\nand Bern found Geneva in a state of apparent tranquillity.\r\n\r\nPermanent ill will was fostered only against the syndic Trembley,\r\ncommander of the garrison and conductor of the defensive preparations\r\nof the council. Whatever this person had done by the instructions of\r\nthe council was laid to his individual account, and added to the mass\r\nof dark imputations which were heaped on him, as the head of an already\r\nobnoxious family. He plumed himself on the favour of the confederate\r\nambassadors, and forfeited thus the last chance of retrieving himself in\r\nthe public opinion. The remembrance of the armed intervention of Zurich\r\nand Bern, in 1707, was too recent to admit of their ambassadors doing\r\nany good to Trembley’s cause through the medium of pacific intercession.\r\nThe departure of these embassies removed the only screen of the syndic:\r\nhe demanded his dismission, which was refused him, in order to deprive\r\nhim of his functions more ignominiously. No resistance or artifice of\r\na powerful connection could save him: the tumults were renewed with\r\nincreased fury; and the question soon ceased to regard the person or\r\nparty of Trembley, and became that of the triumph of the aristocratic or\r\ndemocratic principle at Geneva. In 1737, the council ventured several\r\narrests, and the consequence was that the whole body of burghers rushed\r\nto arms, and the council was defeated, not without bloodshed. A garrison\r\nfrom Bern and Zurich was thrown into the town: the ambassadors of these\r\ncantons, in concert with the French ambassadors, undertook the office\r\nof mediators, and in 1738 framed a constitution which set limits to the\r\nassumptions of the council and the principal families, and was gratefully\r\nand all but unanimously accepted as a fundamental law by the burghers.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [1762-1768 A.D.]]\r\n\r\nAfter four and twenty years of repose and prosperity, occasion was given\r\nto new political movements at Geneva by a subject of a nature purely\r\nspeculative. It pleased more than one government about this time to apply\r\nthe doom of fire, which had been visited by inquisitors on the ill fated\r\nvictims of their zealotry, to certain of the more remarkable works of\r\nthe human intellect--a proceeding highly calculated to draw the eyes of\r\nthe reading public on productions which seemed worthy of such signal\r\ncondemnation. On the first appearance of that work of Rousseau which\r\nopened views so novel and so striking on the moral and still more on the\r\nphysical education of man, the parliament of Paris had the work burned\r\nby the hangman, and sentenced Rousseau to imprisonment, which he only\r\nescaped by flight. Both of these decisions were immediately repeated by\r\nthe council of Geneva [1762], which improved on them by launching a like\r\ncondemnatory sentence against the _Contrat Social_ of the same author. It\r\nwas in vain that Rousseau’s connections demanded a copy of the sentence\r\nagainst him: their reiterated demands, though supported by a large body\r\nof burghers, were rejected by the council. The popular party, which\r\nvindicated the right of the burgher assembly to bring up representations\r\nor remonstrances against the council on any subject under discussion,\r\ndistinguished themselves by the name of representatives. Their claims\r\nwere met by asserting a _droit négatif_, or right of rejection, on the\r\nstrength of which the council pretended that nothing that should not have\r\nbeen previously consented to by themselves could come before the general\r\nassembly. The partisans of the council were called negatives.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: JEAN JACQUES ROUSSEAU\r\n\r\n(1712-1778)]\r\n\r\nThe tranquillity of Geneva was once more disturbed to such a degree by\r\npassionate discourses, party writings, and manœuvres that the ambassadors\r\nof Zurich, Bern, and France again interfered, and pronounced themselves\r\nin favour of the council. The representatives rejected their decision,\r\nthe ambassadors left Geneva, French troops advanced on the town, and all\r\ntrade and intercourse were suspended. But the French ministry speedily\r\nbecame lukewarm in the cause of the negatives. The latter, when they\r\nfound themselves abandoned by all foreign aid, apprehending what might\r\nensue, patched up a peace with the representatives. By a compact closed\r\nin March, 1768, the burghers acquired valuable rights, and even a third\r\nparty, that of the so-called _natifs_ or _habitans_ (old inhabitants,\r\nexcluded by birth from taking part in public affairs), obtained extended\r\nfranchises, and was flattered with a prospect of participation in all the\r\nrights of citizenship.\r\n\r\nBut on recovery from the first panic, reciprocal hatred soon revived. The\r\nnegatives were vexed at having made such important sacrifices, and aimed\r\nat resuming all their former ascendency. Moreover they found a favourable\r\nhearing in the French court, which had long viewed with an evil eye\r\nthe trade and wealth of Geneva, desired to raise the neighbouring\r\nVersoix to a commercial town, and hoped, by encouraging tumult and\r\ndisorder at Geneva, either to annihilate its industry and opulence, or\r\nultimately to bring it under the sovereignty of France. French emissaries\r\ntherefore aided the negatives in spiriting the natifs up against the\r\nrepresentatives, by promising to confer on them the franchises withheld\r\nby the latter. But the representatives flew to arms, took possession\r\nof the gates, and speedily succeeded in disarming the unpractised and\r\nundisciplined mob of natifs. Well aware by what manœuvres the natifs had\r\nbeen led to revolt, they prudently abstained from taking any vindictive\r\nmeasures against them; but, on the contrary, imparted to them, in 1781,\r\nthat equality of rights which had been promised by the negatives, and\r\nendeavoured thus to win them over permanently to the common cause.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [1782 A.D.]]\r\n\r\nThe council, on the other hand, impelled by French influence, declared\r\nthe newly conferred rights illegally extorted, and invoked the mediation\r\nof Bern and Zurich. But, betwixt representative stubbornness and\r\nnegative assumption, the ambassadors of these towns could exert but\r\nlimited influence. They essayed to put an end to disputes by amicable\r\narrangements, but were baffled by the intrigues of the French court,\r\nwhich was resolved to recognise no democratical system on its frontiers,\r\nand soon proceeded to open force in support of its secret policy. The\r\nfirst act of aggression was to garrison Versoix; a measure which gave\r\njust offence to Zurich and Bern, who thereupon renounced all adhesion to\r\nthe mediation of 1738, and left the Genevans to their own discretion.\r\nFrance also declared she would mix no more in the affairs of Geneva; the\r\ngovernment was overthrown and a new constitution established.\r\n\r\nZurich and Bern now declared formally and coldly that they could not\r\nacknowledge a government erected by revolt. Still more indignation was\r\nexhibited by France and Savoy, who entered into a league for the coercion\r\nof the town. Bern, too, joined this league in 1782, that the destiny of\r\nGeneva, that _point d’appui_ of her own dominion, might not be trusted\r\naltogether to the caprices of foreign powers. On the appearance of the\r\nallied troops before the gates of Geneva, the burghers, unaware of the\r\nbad state of their defences, swore to bury themselves in the ruins of\r\ntheir native town rather than yield. But when the cannon of the besiegers\r\nwas advanced up to their walls, and the alternative of desperate\r\nresistance or surrender was offered, the disunited city opened her gates\r\nwithout stroke of sword, after the principal heads of the representative\r\nparty had taken to flight.\r\n\r\nMortal dread accompanied the victorious troops as they entered Geneva.\r\nMany had reason to tremble for their lives, their liberty, and\r\npossessions. No punishments, however, were inflicted, excepting only\r\nthe banishment of the principal popular leaders; but the rights of the\r\nburghers were almost entirely annihilated by the arbitrary arrangements\r\nof the victors; the government was invested by them with almost unlimited\r\npower, and proceeded under their auspices to prohibit all secret\r\nsocieties, military exercises, books and pamphlets on recent events, and\r\nto reinforce the garrison by twelve hundred men under foreign leaders.\r\nThus the town was reduced to utter subjection, and depopulated by exile\r\nand emigration. From thenceforwards commerce and enterprise fell into\r\ndecay; and for seven long years a forced, unnatural calm dwelt in Geneva.\r\n\r\nDuring these years the government was conducted with much mildness, the\r\nadministration of justice was impartial, that of the public revenues\r\nincorrupt, art and industry were encouraged to the utmost. But nothing\r\ncould win the lost hearts of the people back to the government. The\r\niniquity of the so-called _règlement_ of 1782, the destruction of their\r\nfranchises, and the disarming of their persons, had wounded irrecoverably\r\nthe feelings of the burghers. The malcontents increased daily in number;\r\nand even many former negatives now disowned their party, which had gone\r\ngreater lengths than they had ever wished or expected. At length, on\r\nthe death of Vergennes, the French minister, and arch enemy of Genevan\r\nindependence, the spirit of freedom awoke with all its ancient strength\r\nin Geneva, and the burghers arose to break their slavish fetters. But the\r\nrecital of the subsequent occurrences must be postponed until we come to\r\nnotice the train of events fired by the French Revolution.\r\n\r\n\r\nTUMULTS IN NEUCHÂTEL\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [1748-1767 A.D.]]\r\n\r\nThe little principality of Neuchâtel, the succession of which had\r\ndescended in the same line since the era of the second Burgundian\r\nmonarchy, came, in 1707, into the hands of the king of Prussia, as next\r\nheir to the ancient house of Châlons. In 1748, Frederick II displayed\r\nthat love of economy which distinguished all his measures, by farming out\r\ncertain parts of the public revenue arising from tithes, ground rents,\r\nand the crown lands; from the former administration of which many of\r\nthe inhabitants had enjoyed considerable profits. The loss of these, of\r\ncourse, was felt as a grievance by the losers; but what was viewed with\r\nmore concern by the mass of the inhabitants was the prospect of still\r\nfurther innovations. Accordingly five communes of the Val de Travers\r\ntransmitted their remonstrances through a delegate to Berlin; and their\r\nexample was soon afterwards followed throughout the principality.\r\n\r\nThe arrival of two commissaries, despatched by the king to Neuchâtel,\r\nwas viewed with discontent as an encroachment on its immunities.\r\nShortly after their coming, an attempt was made to put in execution the\r\nproposed financial system, of which the only result was to provoke a\r\ntumultuous popular movement. On the 7th of January, 1767, the burgher\r\nassembly of Neuchâtel passed a resolution of exclusion from the rights\r\nof citizenship, against all who should farm or guarantee the farming\r\nof the revenues. On this the royal commissary, Von Derschau, brought a\r\nsuit before the council of Bern, against the town of Neuchâtel; and the\r\nadvocate-general, Gaudot, who had formerly been a popular favourite, much\r\nto the surprise of his fellow-citizens, seceded to the royal side, and\r\nthenceforwards gave his active assistance to the commissary.\r\n\r\nThe cause was decided at Bern (with some limitations) in the royal\r\nfavour. With regard to the resolutions of the Neuchâtel burghers, already\r\nreferred to, it was decreed that they should be cancelled in the presence\r\nof the burgher assembly, and a public apology made to the vice-governor.\r\nThe costs of the whole process to be paid by the town. Gaudot, who had\r\nattacked the civic immunities both by word and writing, naturally became\r\nan object of popular indignation. By way of compensation, however, he\r\nreceived a lucrative government office, along with the functions of\r\nprocurator-general, from which another man had been removed who possessed\r\nthe popular favour. He returned to Neuchâtel from Bern with the royal\r\nplenipotentiaries. These and the vice-governor advised him to take up his\r\nresidence in the castle; but, in spite of their recommendations, Gaudot\r\nthought fit to repair to his own residence. The same evening, clamour\r\nand disturbance took place around the house, which the magistrates were\r\nforced to protect by military force.\r\n\r\nThe next morning the mob returned in increased numbers, and was still\r\nfurther exasperated by missiles being thrown down upon them. A carriage,\r\nescorted by servants in the royal livery, which had been sent by the\r\nking’s commissary for Gaudot, was knocked to pieces by the infuriated\r\nmultitude. Gaudot and his nephew now imprudently fired from the windows,\r\nand their shots took effect, fatally for themselves. The exasperated\r\npopulace forced its way into the house; Gaudot was killed by three shots,\r\nand the mob dispersed after the deed, with cries of “Long live the\r\nking.” The chief actors in this tragedy escaped, and could be executed\r\nonly in effigy. The whole affair was ultimately compromised by the\r\nbenevolent moderation of the great Frederick; and terms of pacification\r\nwere accepted by the communes, which provided alike against arbitrary\r\ngovernment and popular turbulence.\r\n\r\nOn this occasion, Frederick displayed more generosity than would have\r\nbeen shown by any cantonal government; and his conduct seemed to justify\r\nthe general reflection, which must often occur to the student of Swiss\r\nhistory that when administrative abuses are introduced into a monarchy,\r\nit only requires a well-disposed and enlightened prince to crush the\r\ngang of official oppressors and extortioners; because such a prince is\r\npowerfully backed in such measures by the public opinion. Whereas, when\r\nthe majority of the ruling class in misnamed republics is corrupted so\r\nfar as to speculate on the profits of malversation, it generally takes\r\ncare to recruit its ranks with new accomplices; or, at all events,\r\nonly to promote to public offices such men as will at least shut their\r\neyes to public abuses. The magnanimity of Frederick was but ill repaid\r\nto his successor by the tumults which ensued in Neuchâtel on the\r\ncommencement of the French Revolution; and we have lately seen the same\r\nmisunderstandings, as in the last century, arise between the now canton\r\nof Neuchâtel and its Prussian sovereign.\r\n\r\n\r\nARISTOCRACY AND DEMOCRACY\r\n\r\nThe democratical cantons, where the assembled population exercised\r\nthe supreme power in their _landsgemeinde_, held the lowest station,\r\nin almost every respect, amongst the confederates. Narrowness of\r\nmind and ignorant hatred of all innovation withstood every proposal\r\nof improvement; while passion and prejudice, aided by the artifices\r\nof demagogues, often occasioned acts of crying injustice. Judicial\r\nproceedings were in the highest degree arbitrary; confession of crimes\r\nwas extracted by torture, which, indeed, was often employed when nothing\r\nmore remained to confess. Capital punishment, even for minor offences,\r\nwas by no means rare. Public offices, particularly that of bailiff or\r\nland-vogt, were commonly conferred not on the worthiest but on the\r\nhighest bidder; and the proceeds of this ignominious traffic went to the\r\npublic treasury. Was it to be wondered at if these functionaries in their\r\nturn set justice up to auction in their bailiwicks, and endeavoured to\r\nrecover their advances to the government by every sort of oppression of\r\nits subjects?\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [1780 A.D.]]\r\n\r\nMental cultivation was extremely neglected in these cantons, scientific\r\nestablishments were rare, and those for education were, for the most\r\npart, in the hands of the capuchins; whose _esprit de corps_ was at\r\nleast on one occasion beneficial, by preventing the admission of the\r\njesuits into the canton of Schwytz in 1758. Elsewhere, however, similar\r\ninfluences produced worse effects. In Glarus, so late as 1780, an\r\nunfortunate servant girl was executed as a witch, on the charge of having\r\nlamed the leg of a child by magic, and having caused it to vomit pins.\r\nCredulous souls were even found to believe the affirmation that the girl\r\nhad administered pin-seed through the medium of a magical cake, which had\r\nafterwards borne its fruit within the body of the child. The political\r\nrelations of these cantons, in the period now before us, were of little\r\nimportance.\r\n\r\nThe constitutions of the aristocratical cantons had all of them this\r\ncircumstance in common, that not only the capital towns assumed the\r\nrule of the whole canton, but the burghers of those towns themselves\r\nwere divided into ruling and non-ruling families, of which the former\r\nmonopolised admission to all places of honour. But the governments of\r\nthese cantons deserve to be treated of more at length.\r\n\r\nBern, which, in the first period after its foundation, had no domains\r\nof any importance outside its walls, possessed in that immediately\r\npreceding the French revolution a territory containing more than 400,000,\r\ninhabitants. This considerable tract of land was administered by 250\r\nruling families, of which, however, only about sixty were in actual\r\npossession of the government; and these again were divided into so-called\r\ngreat and small families, and did not easily suffer others to rise to\r\nan equality with them. The sovereign power resided in 299 persons, of\r\nwhom the great council was composed. A little council or senate of\r\nfive-and-twenty formed the executive. The rural districts and the Pays\r\nde Vaud were governed by land-vogts or bailiffs. It was chiefly there\r\nthat discontent prevailed against the Bernese government. The nobles of\r\nthe Pays de Vaud were rendered wholly insensible to the real and solid\r\nadvantages secured to them by that government, by resentment of their\r\nexclusion from all public employments. The peasants of that district, for\r\nthe most part subjects or bondsmen of the nobles, sighed under the weight\r\nof feudal oppression and its accustomed offspring, poverty, neglected\r\nculture, mental and moral abortion.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Davel_\r\n\r\nA singular attempt at revolt was made in 1723 by Major Daniel Abraham\r\nDavel, a well-intentioned man, of excellent character, but a decided\r\npolitical and religious enthusiast, possessed with the idea that he was\r\ncalled by inspiration to emancipate the Vaud from Bern. He assembled\r\nthe regiment of militia which he commanded, under the pretext of a\r\nreview, and with these troops, who were altogether ignorant of his real\r\ndesign, and unprovided with stores or ammunition, he surprised the town\r\nof Lausanne at a point of time when all the Bernese land-vogts had gone\r\nto Bern for the annual installation. Davel offered his aid for the\r\nrestoration of independence to the hastily assembled town council. He\r\nfound, however, no kindred spirit in that body; and the cautious citizens\r\nput him off with fair words till a force was under arms sufficient to\r\ncrush him. Meanwhile his troops had discovered the real object of their\r\ncommander, and shrank from him in surprise and consternation. He himself\r\nwas arrested, cruelly tortured for the discovery of accomplices, of whom\r\nhe had none, and lastly beheaded.\r\n\r\nA certain contempt of scholastic acquirements seemed the prevailing\r\ntone at Bern; and school education naturally came to deserve the low\r\nesteem which it met with. Accordingly those patrician youths who did\r\nnot serve in the army remained for the most part unemployed until they\r\nobtained places under government. The establishment of what was called\r\nthe “exterior state” afforded but a superficial substitute for more solid\r\nattainments, and initiated youth only too early in the petty intrigues\r\nand jealousies of faction. This institution, which was also known by\r\nthe name of the “shadow state,” was intended to give the youth of the\r\nruling families opportunities for acquainting themselves with the forms\r\nat least of public business, and of acquiring an unembarrassed address,\r\nso important for republicans. It parodised the dignities and offices of\r\nthe state, the election of avoyers, councillors, and senators, had its\r\nsecretaries and functionaries of all ranks, and distributed by lot 120\r\nvogtships, which for the most part took their names from ruined castles.\r\n\r\nWithout any sufficient evidence, some would refer to the era of the\r\nBurgundian war the origin of this institution, which received the\r\nsanction of government in 1687, and for which a council-house, far more\r\nsplendid than that which belonged to the actual government, was built in\r\n1729. The seal of this “exterior state” bore an ape astride on a lobster,\r\nand looking at himself in a mirror. These and similar traits of humour\r\nseem to owe their descent to an era exceedingly remote from the measured\r\nformality of later times.\r\n\r\nThe government of Lucerne, which with Solothurn and Fribourg formed the\r\nremaining pure Swiss aristocracies, consisted of a little council of\r\nsix-and-thirty members, which, reinforced by sixty-four others, held\r\nthe sovereign authority. With regard to intellectual cultivation, the\r\nmost contradictory features were observable at Lucerne. On the one hand,\r\nlearning, enlightenment, and patriotism were hereditary distinctions\r\nof some families; while, on the other hand, the mass was imbued with\r\nignorant fanaticism. On the one hand, the encroachments of the papacy\r\nwere resisted with inflexible firmness; while, on the other hand, the\r\nclergy kept possession of a highly mischievous influence in the state.\r\nOn the one hand, a series of saints’ days and holidays was abolished, as\r\nbeing dedicated to dissoluteness more than devotion; while, on the other\r\nhand, we are horror-struck by the burning of a so-called heretic. In\r\n1747, a court, consisting of four clergymen, sentenced Jacob Schmidli, a\r\nman of blameless life, to be strangled, and then burned with his books\r\nand writings, because he had not only read the Bible for his private\r\nedification, but had explained and recommended it to others as the sole\r\ntrue basis of religion. His wife, his six children, and seventy-one other\r\npersons were banished, his house was burned to the ground by the hands\r\nof the public executioner, and a monument raised on its former site, to\r\nperpetuate the ignomy (query: of the victim or of his judges?).\r\n\r\nThe appearance of two pamphlets in 1769, on the question “whether removal\r\nor restriction of the monastic orders might not be found beneficial to\r\nthe Catholic cantons?” excited terrible uproar at Lucerne, where certain\r\nclasses were constantly scenting danger to church or state from some\r\nquarter. The town and county clergy, and the bigots in the council, were\r\nrejoiced to get so good an opportunity to persecute the holders of free\r\nprinciples, and raised a deplorable howl, as if the canton were on the\r\nverge of destruction. The whole population was plunged in consternation\r\nand astonishment, by thundering sermons and rigorous prohibitions of\r\nthe obnoxious work. Free-thinkers were fulminated against by name from\r\nthe pulpits; and Schinznach, which had witnessed the formation of the\r\nHelvetic society, was denounced as the focus and headquarters of heresy.\r\n\r\nThis society, which aimed at the diffusion of useful knowledge, public\r\nspirit, and union throughout the Helvetic body, without reference to\r\nvarieties of religion, rank, or political system, was founded by a knot\r\nof patriotic and instructed men, in the pious hope of arresting the\r\ndecline of the confederation. At its commencement it consisted of no more\r\nthan nine members, but added to its numbers with astonishing rapidity.\r\nThe society was soon viewed with an evil eye by the cantonal governments,\r\nwhich dreaded all independence of feeling and action in the people.\r\nAt Bern, political dangers were anticipated from it, as symptoms of\r\nrefractoriness were exhibited shortly after its formation by the nobles\r\nin the Vaud; while at Lucerne it was regarded as a conspiracy for shaking\r\noff the Catholic religion, and assisting the supposed ambition of Bern to\r\ngain ascendency over the whole confederation.\r\n\r\nThe aristo-democratical governments next come under our notice, and\r\nin these, as in most of the purely aristocratical, the metropolis had\r\nobtained unlimited power over the whole canton. In these, however,\r\nparticular families did not engross the sovereign power; the collective\r\nbody of citizens had maintained themselves by means of the regulations\r\nof their guilds in the possession of considerable influence over the\r\npublic affairs. Accordingly the magistracy favoured the monopolies\r\nwhich enriched the metropolitan traders, and imposed restraints on the\r\nindustry and invention of the surrounding country. Thence the subjects\r\nof these towns were much more harshly administered than those of the\r\naristocratical cantons. Their ancient charters fell into oblivion, and\r\nwere withdrawn as far as possible from public inspection; they were not\r\nonly excluded from civil and military, but even from ecclesiastical\r\nfunctions; and the exercise of many branches of industry, and the sale\r\nof their productions in the towns, was wholly cut off by corporation\r\nprivileges. Moreover, since the commencement of the century of which we\r\nare treating, no mode of acquiring the rights of burghers remained open;\r\nthey were only conferred on extremely rare occasions to reward eminent\r\nmerit; or when the times became troublesome to conciliate influential\r\nburghers. Hence that discontent and disaffection which broke out at the\r\nclose of the century found a principal focus in the heart of the mixed\r\naristocracies.\r\n\r\nIn the larger cantons the public administration was for the most\r\npart incorrupt; and that of justice was liable on the whole to fewer\r\ncomplaints than in many other European countries. The pay of public\r\nservants, with few exceptions, was extremely moderate. Men who had\r\ndevoted their whole lives to public affairs, and who had filled the\r\nhighest offices in the state, lost more than they gained by the bounty\r\nof their country. At Zurich, the expenses of the government were wholly\r\ndefrayed without the imposition of taxes, properly so called, from\r\nthe revenues and interests of the national lands and capital, from\r\nground-rents, tithes, the salt monopoly, and the produce of the premium\r\npaid by the several guilds of traders in return for their exclusive\r\nprivileges. The same description is applicable to the government of Bern,\r\nexcepting that here the course of justice was tedious and expensive. The\r\nsuperior financial resources of the latter canton enabled her to execute\r\nmore for public ends than Zurich. Bern invested considerable sums in\r\nforeign securities, particularly in the English funds; and, besides,\r\namassed a treasure amounting to some millions of dollars, which became,\r\nas we shall presently see, and as Mably had predicted, the booty of\r\nrapacious and powerful neighbours.\r\n\r\nVery different was the condition of the free or common bailiwicks,\r\nparticularly those of the democratical cantons; here most of the\r\nland-vogts sought by every species of extortion to indemnify themselves\r\nfor the sums for which they had in fact bought their places from the\r\ngeneral assemblies of their respective cantons. Many made an open\r\ntraffic of justice; took presents from both parties; helped delinquents\r\nto evade deserved punishment who could pay for exemption, and exacted\r\ncontributions from the wealthier class whenever and wherever they could.\r\nEven farther than in the German domains of Switzerland were abuses of\r\nthis kind carried in the Italian bailiwicks, and most of all in those\r\nof the Grisons. The inevitable tendency of such treatment was to debase\r\nthe popular character in those districts, and its effects have left\r\nunequivocal traces even to this day.\r\n\r\nIn those towns of which the constitution was grounded on corporate\r\nbodies, the privileges of the burghers and their guilds received\r\nprogressive extensions. Propositions were made which would hardly have\r\nbeen conceivable in monarchical states, and could only, in fact, take\r\nplace where particular classes had to decide upon the destiny of the\r\nrest of their fellow-countrymen. In Bâle it was several times proposed,\r\nunder the pretext of protection to agriculture, that the exercise of\r\ncertain manufactures should be prohibited altogether in the rural part of\r\nthe canton.[c]\r\n\r\n\r\nFEDERAL RELATIONS OF THE SWISS STATES\r\n\r\nThe federal bond which united the various cantons and their allies\r\nwas very loose, and far different from that which fastened together\r\nthe united provinces of Holland, or even from the federal compact\r\nof the United States of North America. There was not in Switzerland\r\nany permanent sovereign body, no standing federal magistrate equally\r\nacknowledged by all, no central government having its own establishment,\r\nits own treasury, its own servants, civil and military. The general\r\ndiets could not decide upon any important question, unless it had been\r\npreviously debated and decided on in the councils of each of the cantons,\r\nwho were applied to by their own deputies for fresh instructions at every\r\nnew case which was brought before the diet. The cantons were not even\r\neach allied to all. The eight older cantons had among them a federal\r\ncompact for their common defence, and even of these eight the five first\r\nonly, _viz._ Zurich, Schwyz, Uri, Unterwalden, and Lucerne, were bound\r\nto enter into no other alliance without each other’s consent; while the\r\nother three, Glarus, Zug, and Bern, were at liberty to form alliances\r\nwith other states or foreign princes, provided such alliances contained\r\nnothing prejudicial to the federal bond. The eight cantons were also\r\nbound, by the convention of Stanz, to assist one another in supporting\r\nthe form of government established in each of them.\r\n\r\nThe five junior cantons, _viz._ Fribourg, Solothurn, Bâle, Schaffhausen,\r\nand Appenzell, had no federal bond with the whole of the rest, nor among\r\nthemselves, but every one of them was allied to some one or more of the\r\nothers. The three forest cantons alone were allied to every one of the\r\nother cantons. By these means, however, the guarantee of common defence\r\nwas secured to each; for, as any canton attacked had the right of calling\r\nsome other cantons to its assistance, and as these were entitled to\r\ncall others, all would be brought in to take a part, in virtue of their\r\nparticular bonds.\r\n\r\nThe general diets of the confederation were either ordinary or\r\nextraordinary. The ordinary diets met once a year at Frauenfeld in\r\nThurgau, instead of Baden, where, until the treaty of Aarau in 1712, they\r\nhad been accustomed to meet. The deputy from Zurich presided: he brought\r\nforward the matters to be discussed, collected the votes, framed the\r\nresolutions, etc. Each canton or associate had one vote and questions\r\nwere decided by a simple majority. The sittings were held with closed\r\ndoors, and at the end of the session the deputy of Zurich drew up a\r\nstatement of the decisions of the diet, of which he sent a copy round to\r\neach canton. The principal business of the diet was to hear appeals from\r\nthe common bailiwicks, and to inspect the accounts and inquire into the\r\nconduct of the bailiffs.\r\n\r\nExtraordinary diets were assembled at the request of any particular\r\ncanton, or of any of the foreign ministers in case of urgent business.\r\nIn such a case the canton of Zurich summoned the other cantons to send\r\ntheir deputies to Frauenfeld, or any other place fixed upon, acquainting\r\nthem at the same time with the nature of the subjects which were to be\r\ndiscussed, in order that the cantonal governments might give instructions\r\nto their deputies accordingly. The foreign minister, at whose request an\r\nextraordinary diet was convoked, was bound to pay the expenses of the\r\ndeputies who were thus called from their homes at an unexpected season.\r\n\r\nThe partial diets were held by the Protestant cantons at Aarau, and by\r\nthe Catholic ones at Lucerne. There was no fixed time for their meeting,\r\nbut they were summoned as the occasion required it.\r\n\r\nA regulation, called the “defensionale,” was, as we have seen, agreed\r\nupon at a general diet held at Baden in 1668, for providing against\r\nsudden emergencies, such as an attack from foreign powers, when the\r\nproceedings of the diet would have proved too slow for the common\r\nsafety. In such a case deputies were to be named by all the members of\r\nthe Helvetic body, and invested with full powers to direct the military\r\nforce of the nation, which was to be raised by contingents from the\r\nmilitia of each state. This body consisted of 9600 men for the thirteen\r\ncantons, 1400 for the associates, and 2400 for the subject bailiwicks--in\r\nall 13,400 men; which number, however, might be doubled and trebled if\r\nrequired.\r\n\r\nThe militia of each canton consisted of all the males from sixteen to\r\nsixty years of age, and these received military instruction at certain\r\nepochs. Only one-third of the whole, however, consisting of the youngest\r\nand strongest, were enrolled into regiments, the other two-thirds\r\nsupplying them with recruits if necessary. The regiments were divided\r\ninto fusileers and electionaries, the fusileers being all young unmarried\r\nmen, who were considered as always ready to march at a moment’s notice;\r\nthe electionaries were composed of the married men, of an age and size\r\nproper for service, and these were called out after the fusileers. When\r\nin active service they received regular pay; but every man was bound to\r\nprovide his own uniform, arms, and accoutrements.\r\n\r\nThe Swiss, it is well known, furnished troops to several European powers,\r\naccording to certain treaties or capitulations, as they were called,\r\nagreed upon between those powers and the various cantons. The chief power\r\nhaving Swiss troops in its service was France, who had retained them ever\r\nsince the treaty made between the Swiss and Louis XI. Under Louis XIV the\r\nnumber of Swiss troops in the French service amounted to 28,000 men; but,\r\nin 1790, at the beginning of the French Revolution, there were not more\r\nthan 15,000, who were divided into twelve regiments. Six Swiss regiments\r\nwere in the service of Holland, four were serving in Piedmont, four at\r\nNaples, and four in Spain: the pope had also a small body guard of Swiss.\r\nThere has been considerable misconception abroad upon this subject; the\r\ncantons have been represented as selling their countrymen as if they\r\nwere cattle, while the truth is that the men were not sold, but enlisted\r\nof their own accord for a certain period of time, receiving the bounty\r\nmoney.[d]\r\n\r\nAgriculture was advanced by the cultivation of clover and of other\r\nartificial grasses, and by the consequent increase of pasturage and\r\nmanure. Many districts which had formerly been regarded as unfruitful\r\nwere thus rendered remarkable for fertility. The processes of manuring,\r\nand many other processes in Swiss cultivation, became a model for foreign\r\nagriculturists. Arts and manufactures were extended more and more widely.\r\nIn the canton of Bern, in the Thurgau, and elsewhere, industry was\r\nemployed on native materials in the linen manufacture; in Zurich, St.\r\nGall, and Appenzell, in working up imported wool in spinning, weaving,\r\nand cotton printing. Silk manufactures occupied Zurich and Bâle, and\r\nthe latter town enriched itself by its riband manufacture. Trade in\r\nall its branches throve at Geneva; where a wholesale watch manufacture\r\nwas conducted, and from whence watchmaking was soon spread through\r\nthe district of Neuchâtel, where it suggested many other mechanical\r\nprocesses.\r\n\r\nIntellectual culture and social refinements marched abreast with\r\ncommercial wealth. Not only the towns were embellished with architectural\r\nstructures, but in the Emmenthal, and around the lakes of Zurich and\r\nGeneva, arose new and splendid edifices which bespoke increasing\r\nopulence. In Neuchâtel, which a century before had been inhabited by\r\nshepherds, the villages assumed the appearance of towns; and the wealthy\r\nmarts of England or the Netherlands were recalled to the mind of the\r\ntraveller by the principal street of Winterthur. Intercourse with other\r\nstates in trade or in foreign services naturalised new wants and desires,\r\nyet many still adhered to the old usages and manners. In whole districts,\r\nespecially in the democratic cantons, public opinion imperiously\r\nset limits to the advance of luxury. In other places sumptuary laws\r\nmaintained a struggle with the various arts of invention; and a wholesome\r\nstate of simplicity was preserved in Zurich, St. Gall, and Bâle, in which\r\ncelibacy became a rarity.[c]\r\n\r\nAlthough in political matters dissentions prevailed, yet in intellectual\r\nand scientific life a sense of the unity of the fatherland was beginning\r\nto arise, notably in the reformed towns, where intellectual life had\r\nmade great strides since the success of the war of Toggenburg. Men\r\nbegan to study their own position, learnt to know the individuality of\r\nSwitzerland, and drew thence the hope of a brighter future. The pioneers\r\nof the movement were Scheuchzer of Zurich, and Haller of Bern. J. J.\r\nScheuchzer (1672-1733), physician and naturalist, made himself famous by\r\nvarious journeys into the Swiss Alps, wrote the first natural history\r\nof Switzerland, and also completed a large map of Switzerland, by which\r\nlabours he put new life into patriotism.\r\n\r\nAlbrecht von Haller (_ob._ 1777), the great poet and naturalist, by\r\nunrivalled industry acquired an extensive and learned education; he also\r\npossessed a strong poetic vein, and a warm and patriotic heart. Among\r\nhis poems which appeared in 1732, _Die Alpen_ (_The Alps_) made a great\r\nimpression by its poetic depth and the novelty of its ideas. Full of\r\nindignation at the depravity of the time, and yearning for natural and\r\nunspoiled conditions, he there depicts with vigorous touches the life\r\nof nature and of men in the Alps, the simple, beautiful customs of the\r\nAlpine folk, with a patriotic warmth and enthusiasm before unknown. In\r\nanother poem, _Der Mann der Welt_ (_The Man of the World_), he laments\r\nthe degeneration of his fatherland; in a third, _Die verdorbenen Sitten_\r\n(_Demoralisation_), in contradistinction to the good old times, he\r\napostrophises the decay of his own day, exclaiming--“O Helvetia, once\r\nthe land of heroes, how is it possible that the men whom we now behold\r\ncould have descended from thy former inhabitants?” By his poems and his\r\nresearches in natural science Haller became so famous in other lands that\r\nhe received a number of honourable calls; yet he declined them all: he\r\nwanted to devote his powers to his beloved country, and from 1753 until\r\nhis end he served her as a government official with affectionate devotion\r\nand self-sacrifice.[e]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: J. C. LAVATER\r\n\r\n(1741-1801)]\r\n\r\nEloquence and daring imagination conferred European celebrity on Lavater.\r\nRousseau promulgated truths in education and in politics which will not\r\nbe lost for future generations, whatever alloy of paradox or perverse\r\nmisapplication they might suffer from himself or his followers. The\r\nbitterness of religious and political dissension which had long prevailed\r\nin so many odious forms began to decline, and the personal worth of men\r\nbegan to be estimated by less absurd criteria than their speculative\r\nopinions. Old prejudices vanished, or at all events were mitigated, and\r\neven if the recognition of principles more enlightened was with many a\r\nmatter of fashion and imitation, still those may be deemed fortunate\r\nwhose existence falls on a period in which truth and liberal sentiments\r\nfind favour and adoption.\r\n\r\nOn the whole, the century was not worse than those which had preceded it.\r\nEven if the forms of government favoured many abuses, a more extended\r\nspirit of activity prevailed amongst the people than in previous\r\ngenerations; and though it is true that no extraordinarily great actions\r\nwere performed, it is also true that no great occasion called for their\r\nperformance. It cannot be denied that too much jealousy prevailed between\r\nthe cantons, and that more reliance was often placed on strangers than\r\non fellow confederates. But Germany, which united might have given law\r\nto Europe, had been even more distracted by like errors, reduced to\r\na mere battle-field for foreigners, and robbed of its most valuable\r\ndependencies.[c]\r\n\r\nSeldom during the eighteenth century did the confederates act together.\r\nOnly once did the confederation appear as a unit toward the outside.\r\nThat was in 1777, when an alliance was concluded with France which well\r\nexpressed the subserviency of the Swiss at this period to that country.\r\nThe members of the diet convened at Solothurn went through a humiliating\r\nceremony. They appeared in a body at the ambassador’s hotel, followed\r\nhim to church and thence to the place of the deliberations. By this\r\ntreaty the Helvetic body was bound to render a levy of six thousand men\r\nto France in case her territory was invaded, and in return the king of\r\nFrance promised the Swiss help in danger and to maintain the privileges\r\naccorded them by his predecessors.[a][f]\r\n\r\n\r\nSWITZERLAND FEELS THE SHOCK OF THE FRENCH REVOLUTION\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [1789-1794 A.D.]]\r\n\r\nThe Swiss government, as well as that large portion of their subjects who\r\nwere contented with their condition, and desired no alteration in it,\r\nwere startled out of a state of perfect tranquillity by the first shock\r\nof the French revolution. The shifting of the whole political scenery of\r\nEurope surrounded them with entirely new embarrassments. They resembled\r\nsteersmen tolerably capable of guiding their bark safely through the\r\ntempests of their native lakes; but who found themselves now on unknown\r\nseas without chart or compass. The situation of the Swiss regiments\r\nengaged in the French service afforded the first reason for disquietude;\r\nthe next was the apprehension of infection from the principles\r\npredominant in France. Alarming political movements soon began in the\r\ninterior; and the solution of the problems which were set before Swiss\r\npoliticians by the progress of events in the neighbouring countries was\r\nthe more difficult the more various were the views, wants, and relations\r\nof the cantons, and the lands which were subject to them.\r\n\r\nIt was in the latter districts, as might have been expected, that the\r\nnew ideas gained the greatest currency, and that the first attempts\r\nwere made for their realisation. Educated and thinking men in the\r\nsubject towns and territories brooded resentfully on their exclusion\r\nfrom all public posts and dignities. In those cantons where trade and\r\nmanufactures were most cultivated, it was regarded as an intolerable\r\nhardship by the enterprising and wealthy rural proprietor, that he was\r\nhindered by oppressive regulations from purchasing the requisite raw\r\nmaterials, or from disposing of the products of his industry in any\r\nquarter except to a wholesale dealer of the capital. Similar resentments\r\nwere excited by corporate privileges. Nevertheless, in the German regions\r\nof Switzerland, a longer time elapsed before the new modes of thinking,\r\nand the comparisons which they suggested, set the public mind in motion.\r\nThis took place much sooner in the west, where the French language and\r\nneighbourhood made communication easier; above all, in Geneva, where\r\nnothing but an auspicious hour was waited for to burst asunder a yoke\r\nimposed by foreigners.\r\n\r\nA rise in the price of bread, which was imputed to the government,\r\ngave occasion to the long prepared explosion. On the 26th of February,\r\n1789, the burghers assailed the garrison with everything which could\r\nbe turned into a weapon of offence. Fire-engines with boiling water\r\nsupplied the place of artillery: the garrison was put to the rout, and\r\nthe power of the government overturned the more easily, as its foreign\r\nprops had now ceased to support it. The ruling class was compelled to\r\nthrow itself wholly on the citizens, to restore the ancient liberties\r\nof the town, and to recall the banished heads of the representatives.\r\nBut the hour was come for the ruin of Genevan independence. The country\r\npeople and habitans of the town now demanded an equality of rights\r\nwith the burghers, on the model of republican France; and the latter\r\npower was induced to second their wishes, by the suggestions of the\r\nex-representative Clavière. The malcontents were kept for a while in\r\ncheck by troops from Bern and Zurich; but, on the withdrawal of these\r\nin 1792, the country people, habitans and natifs, flew to arms, made\r\nthemselves masters of the town, deposed the government, and established,\r\non the model of France, a national convention, with committees of general\r\nsafety and of public welfare.\r\n\r\nA show of moderation and tranquillity lasted some time longer; but\r\ndistrust and exasperation received continual new aliment, and the\r\ndisinterested friends of peace could hardly prevent some furious\r\noutbreak. Many votes were gained to a proposed new constitution, by the\r\nhope of securing order and repose; and in the beginning of 1794 it was\r\nadopted by a large majority. In April, syndics and council were again\r\ninstalled in their former functions, and the event was announced to\r\nZurich and Bern with expressions of hope and confidence. Bern, however,\r\ncould not resolve, on the instant, to give the name of confederates to\r\nthese newly re-established authorities; and what had been done had no\r\neffect in mitigating the violence of those who put themselves forwards\r\nas the organs of the multitude, which they first set in motion for their\r\nown purposes, and then were forced, in turn, to flatter its passions, in\r\norder to continue popular favourites. Meanwhile, the price of necessaries\r\nrose, while trade and industry stagnated; and the repeated demands for\r\nso-styled free-will offerings to the public were answered by supplies\r\nmore and more sparing.\r\n\r\nIn order to crush, at a stroke, all resistance, and to furnish themselves\r\nwith the necessary stores and ammunition, the party of terrorists made a\r\nnocturnal seizure of the arsenal in July, 1794, occupied all the posts\r\nin warlike array; and filled the prisons of the town, and even the\r\ncorn-magazine, with nearly six hundred men, whom they chose to designate\r\nas aristocrats; and amongst whom were a number of the most respectable\r\nmembers of the magistracy, merchants, and men of letters. Of eight\r\nof the prisoners first examined, a revolutionary tribunal contented\r\nitself with sentencing one to death; but the clamour and threats of the\r\nmultitude worked on these unsteady judges to retract their verdict, and\r\nextend the same condemnation to all the others. The doom of four of\r\nthese was commuted for banishment by the general assembly; but a band of\r\nwretches again collected, stormed the prisons, and the bloody tribunal\r\nnow sentenced their victims to be shot; and afterwards endeavoured to\r\nexcuse itself on the plea that this had only been done to prevent worse\r\natrocities. More executions followed, which included several persons who\r\nhad actively promoted revolution. Numbers were banished, in order to\r\nsecure the ruling party a majority in the general assembly. The large\r\nsums required by a revolutionary government for the payment of public\r\nofficers, and the armed force of the populace, were defrayed by imposing\r\nheavy contributions on the possessors of property; indifferentists being\r\nmade to pay double, aristocrats a treble amount.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [1796 A.D.]]\r\n\r\nParty spirit, however, cooled by degrees; approximations and concessions\r\ntook place between all classes of citizens, who felt, in common, the\r\ngeneral ruin of public and private happiness; and the disappointment of\r\nall the hopes which had formerly found indulgence. In 1796, a return to\r\nthe old constitution was agreed upon, on condition of equality of rights\r\nbeing conceded to the old and new burghers, and the town and country\r\ninhabitants. The exiles returned home, and all rejoiced that they could\r\nagain breathe freely. For two years more, the little republic dragged on\r\nan infirm existence; till it was finally united with France in 1798, and\r\nforced to partake, for fifteen years, the destinies of that country.\r\n\r\nOf the men who had at different times been banished for political\r\noffences from Switzerland, many had taken refuge in the French\r\nmetropolis, and endeavoured to persuade the republican statesmen that\r\ntheir enemies were equally those of France. [Notable among them was La\r\nHarpe of Vaud, who published a treatise on the situation of the Pays\r\nde Vaud and demanded its restoration from Bern.] Their representations\r\nfound the easier audience, as Switzerland was already regarded with\r\ngreedy eyes by their hearers. “At an early period of the Revolution,”\r\nobserves an English writer,[i] “the views of France were directed towards\r\nSwitzerland, as well from its importance as a barrier on her eastern\r\nfrontier, as from its central position between the German Empire and\r\nItaly. The reduction, therefore, of Switzerland, was a favourite object\r\nof the republican rulers, and was only suspended by the dread of adding\r\nits people to the host of enemies who menaced France on all sides; they\r\naccordingly temporised under the mask of friendship, and succeeded in\r\npreserving the neutrality of the Helvetic confederacy, by fomenting the\r\nnational antipathy to the house of Austria. Yet even during this specious\r\ndisplay of friendship, their agents industriously spread disaffection,\r\nand prepared the mine which was ready to explode on the first favourable\r\nopportunity: such an opportunity presented itself at the conclusion of\r\nthe treaty of Campo Formio, which left the Swiss without an ally on the\r\nContinent. At this period the French Republic had acquired a colossal\r\nstrength. The king of Sardinia, deprived of half his territory, was the\r\nvassal of France; the pope, and the king of Naples, owed the possession\r\nof a precarious sceptre to the forbearance of the directory; Prussia\r\npertinaciously maintained her close connection with the new republic;\r\nand Austria, vanquished by the genius of Bonaparte, had concluded a\r\ndishonourable peace.\r\n\r\n“But the French rulers were not content with planting the tricoloured\r\nflag on the summit of Mont Blanc, on the left bank of the Rhine, and\r\nat the mouth of the Scheldt, and with establishing the limits of\r\ntheir empire by the natural boundaries of the Pyrenees, the Alps, the\r\nMediterranean and the ocean. With a view to secure their territories\r\nagainst the future aggressions of the continental powers, they purposed\r\nto form a series of dependent republics along the line of their\r\nfrontiers, as a kind of outwork, to remove the point of attack. At the\r\nextremities of this line they had already established the Ligurian and\r\nBatavian republics; the Cisalpine soon followed. A connecting link of\r\nthis chain was Switzerland, which covered the most vulnerable parts\r\nof the French territory; and, from its natural strength and central\r\nposition, formed the citadel of Europe.”\r\n\r\nBesides these motives, acknowledged by the French themselves, their\r\nrapacity was stimulated by the treasures known to exist at Bern and\r\nelsewhere, the amount of which, as usual, was enormously exaggerated.\r\nWhat was required, in short, was not a motive but a pretext for\r\nintermeddling with the internal regulations of the Helvetic body. That\r\nbody had with the utmost caution avoided giving offence; had recognised\r\nevery successive form of government in France; and had turned out of\r\ntheir territories the unfortunate French _émigrés_ who had fled thither\r\nfor refuge from the rage of their own countrymen.\r\n\r\nThe triumphs of Napoleon in Italy were concluded by the construction of\r\nthe Cisalpine Republic. The Swiss subjects of the Valteline, Chiavenna,\r\nand Bormio, were tempted to desire participation in the freedom thus\r\nestablished on their borders; and Napoleon offered the Grisons the\r\nalternative of conceding equal rights to these districts, or of seeing\r\nthem included in the new Cisalpine state. Parties ran so high on this\r\nproposal, that no friendly understanding was possible; and when the term\r\nallowed for reply elapsed without any being given, Napoleon put his\r\nthreat into effect, and confiscated all property belonging to the Grisons\r\ncontained in the above-mentioned districts.\r\n\r\nSuch was the first encroachment on the ancient limits of Switzerland:\r\nshortly afterwards the bishopric of Bâle was annexed to France. Great\r\nconsternation was caused by these proceedings in the confederation;\r\nbut still more serious evils were at hand. In the canton of Bâle the\r\npeasantry murmured loudly against the town: in the Aargau several towns\r\nadvanced tumultuous claims against Bern, for the recovery of their old\r\nand chartered rights; and the Pays de Vaud reclaimed its freedom with\r\nmore impatience than ever. It was said besides, that a French army was\r\nalready marching on Switzerland; ostensibly to support the claims of the\r\nmalcontents, but really to make themselves masters of the land for their\r\nown purposes. Bern and Fribourg hastily levied forces for the coercion of\r\ntheir turbulent dependencies; and a diet of the confederacy was summoned\r\nat Aarau. Much was said and nothing done at this meeting, as the cantonal\r\ngovernments neither trusted each other nor their subjects. The members of\r\nthe diet renewed the original league of the cantons, as if urged by the\r\npresentiment of its coming dissolution. The oath had hardly been taken,\r\nwhen a messenger from Bâle brought the intelligence that the mansions of\r\nthe land-vogts were in flames; that a large body of peasantry had entered\r\nthe town, and that all the subject districts had declared themselves free.\r\n\r\nThe spectacle of feebleness and fear in the authorities, combined with\r\ndogged resistance to the wishes of the people, of course diffused,\r\ninstead of quelling, the spirit of revolt. As in the thirteenth and\r\nsucceeding century, the prerogatives of the nobles had been forced to\r\nyield to the claims of a class of burghers and of shepherds, so soon as\r\nthe example of the Lombard towns, and the growth of public prosperity,\r\nhad excited independence of feeling; so likewise, in the times of which\r\nwe are treating, it had ceased to be within the power of a privileged\r\nclass to contend with success against the claims of the so-called third\r\norder, encouraged as it was by the example of France. Some districts,\r\nindeed, took no part in the prevalent agitations, and pertinaciously\r\nadhered to the accustomed order of things; others, more distinguished for\r\nenlightenment and enterprise, demanded an equality of rights in town and\r\ncountry; others, again, required the restoration of ancient franchises:\r\nsome regarded nothing as attainable but by French interference; while\r\nnobler minds retained an insurmountable abhorrence for the agency of\r\nstrangers in the internal affairs of their country.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [1797-1798 A.D.]]\r\n\r\nIt became more and more evident that the policy of the French directory\r\nled them to foment intestine discord in Switzerland. For several years\r\npast it had been observed, that foreign emissaries set themselves to\r\nwork upon the public opinion. A person of the name of Mengaud made his\r\nappearance at Bâle, under the unusual and equivocal title of commissary,\r\nand set his seal on the papers of the French embassy: this individual\r\nnot only made no secret of his intelligence with the malcontents in\r\nSwitzerland, but affected to display it ostentatiously. He went to Bern\r\non the 10th of October, 1797, where he demanded, in a note addressed to\r\nthe government, the dismissal of the English ambassador Wickham, who had\r\ncertainly exerted himself openly against France, but had done so as the\r\nenvoy of a power at war with that country. Bern referred the demand of\r\nMengaud to the then directing canton, as a matter which concerned the\r\nwhole confederacy.\r\n\r\nWickham relieved for the moment the embarrassment of the Helvetic\r\nbody, while he deprived the French directory of a present pretence for\r\nviolence, by taking his departure on a tour into Germany; but he left\r\nan able diplomatist behind him in the person of his secretary Talbot.\r\nMengaud was received at Zurich and Bern with undisguised aversion, and\r\nno diplomatic visits were paid him at either of these places. In the\r\nmonth of November, an embassy from the latter town had been sent to\r\nParis; which, though admitted to an audience of the director Barras, soon\r\nreceived a rude dismissal homewards.\r\n\r\nGreat were the hopes infused into the disaffected party by the promises\r\nof Mengaud, and other subordinate agents of France; and proportional\r\nfears were excited amongst the friends of the old system, including\r\nthe greater number of public functionaries. In order to increase their\r\nuneasiness, Mengaud threatened the diet of the confederation in January,\r\n1798, with the entrance of French troops into Switzerland, should Austria\r\nbe suffered to occupy the Grisons. He travelled to the place of meeting\r\nat Aarau, with tricoloured flags flying from his carriage; and, on his\r\narrival there, hung out an immense banner in front of his house. The\r\ntriumphant revolutionists of Bâle had already formed a tricoloured flag\r\nof their own, by the addition of green to their formal cantonal colours,\r\nblack and white, and their delegate at Paris, Ochs, had hastily sketched\r\nwhat he called an Helvetic constitution, on the model of that of the\r\nFrench Republic. This document was printed in Italian, French, and\r\nGerman, and distributed by Mengaud, not in official quarters only, but\r\nthroughout the whole population of the cantons.\r\n\r\n\r\nFRENCH TROOPS IN SWITZERLAND\r\n\r\nIn the mean time, a division of the French army, under Menard, appeared\r\non the western frontier; and the Pays de Vaud, protected by it, declared\r\nits independence of Bern. The Bernese government saw the necessity of\r\ntrying the force of arms on its subjects; and the command of the forces\r\nhaving been declined by councillor Erlach of Spiez, who had hitherto\r\nbeen one of the strongest assertors of aristocracy, it was conferred on\r\nColonel Rudolf Weiss, who had, till then, sustained the character of a\r\nchampion of the opposite system; and had contributed, by a published\r\nwork,[g] to the favourable temper of the partisans of Robespierre towards\r\nthe Swiss confederation. An unusual delegation of full powers placed in\r\nhis hands the whole military government of the Vaud. The new commander\r\nheld conferences with the leaders of the malcontents; published a\r\ntreatise[h] intended to conciliate them, but intermixed conciliation with\r\nmenace. Chillon was recovered by surprise from the insurgents, and the\r\nGerman troops of Bern were moved on the frontiers of the Vaud.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, General Menard was already on the lake of Geneva, with ten\r\nthousand men of the conquering army of Italy; and to him the insurgent\r\nleaders, alarmed for their own safety, addressed themselves. Menard\r\nreplied, that he was instructed to give them aid and protection; and\r\nthreatened Colonel Weiss that he would repel force with force, if the\r\nformer should persist in drawing troops around a territory already\r\ndeclared independent, and in arming the communes against each other.\r\nWithout taking any measures of defence--without even attempting to\r\nmaintain himself on the high grounds--Weiss withdrew to the neighbourhood\r\nof Yverdun. It happened, accidentally, that two French hussars were shot\r\non the outposts of the Bernese army, because they had not immediately\r\nanswered the challenge of the sentinels. This incident was taken up by\r\nMenard, and afterwards by the directory, as an infringement of the law of\r\nnations, and the commencement of hostilities.\r\n\r\nThe revolution of Bâle, and the entrance of French troops into the Pays\r\nde Vaud, rendered it impossible for reflecting men any longer to doubt\r\nthat sweeping social changes were inevitable. Yet the Swiss democracies\r\nwould not be persuaded that anyone could shake their constitutions, or\r\nforce on them a new species of freedom. The numerous friends of things\r\nas they were still hoped to steer themselves through the crisis without\r\nany great sacrifices, by mere dint of tenacity and delay. Many, moreover,\r\nflattered themselves with the notion that the plans of France were\r\nlevelled at no wider mark than the Vaud; and were prompted by a petty\r\nfeeling of jealousy towards Bern [the stronghold of the aristocracy], to\r\nsee nothing in the affair but a mortification to that envied canton.\r\n\r\nIt could hardly be conceived at Bern, that the French should have\r\nadvanced without meeting any resistance up to Yverdun, while the\r\nheadquarters of Colonel Weiss were withdrawn behind Avenche. He was\r\ninstantly dismissed from his command, which was transferred to General\r\nErlach of Hindelbank; but the evil effects of exorbitant discretionary\r\npowers had been so sensibly felt, that the opposite extreme was now\r\nadopted. Meanwhile, the leading statesmen of Bern, had, at length, became\r\nconvinced that concessions must be made to the people. Fifty-two members\r\nwere added to the great council from amongst the burghers, citizens of\r\nthe minor towns, and rural inhabitants. It was resolved to introduce,\r\nwithin a year’s time, a new constitution; in which admission to every\r\npublic function should be open to all, and due proportion should be\r\nobserved in the emoluments of all public services. These resolutions were\r\nlaid before the directory, together with a demand for the withdrawal\r\nof the French troops. The government also stooped to make a like\r\ncommunication to Mengaud, to acquaint him with the actual political\r\nsystem of Bern, and inform him of the wish of that canton to preserve\r\npeace with France. Mengaud made just such an answer as ought to have\r\nbeen expected from him. He demanded a prompt and complete change of the\r\nold political system, declared that further delays could not be suffered\r\nby the majesty of the French Republic; and designated the persevering\r\ndefenders of the existing order as a handful of inveterate tyrants.\r\n\r\nDisregarding their own positive engagements, the French, on the 8th of\r\nFebruary, took possession of the town of Bienne. Yet the confederates\r\nstill hoped to conciliate France, and were encouraged in this illusion by\r\nGeneral Brune, who now commanded the French troops, reinforced by several\r\nthousand men, and fixed his headquarters at Payerne. This subtle leader,\r\nwho, without having performed a lengthened public career, was, to borrow\r\na diplomatic expression, _rompu dans les affaires_, proposed, with artful\r\nblandishments, and with hinted hopes of peaceful adjustment, an armistice\r\nof fourteen days; during which the discipline and enthusiasm of the\r\nBernese army had time to abate, indecision and distrust to increase, and\r\nrecruits to join the French army.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, General Schauenburg had collected a division of troops on the\r\nfrontiers of Solothurn and Bern, equal in strength to that of Brune. The\r\nlatter announced, on the 26th of February, that he had received full\r\npowers to treat from the executive directory. He proposed his ultimatum\r\nto the Swiss delegates, that without farther delay they should introduce\r\na provisional government, take measures for the establishment of a new\r\nconstitution, with securities for freedom and equality, liberate all\r\nprisoners for political offences, and withdraw their own troops, as well\r\nas those of the other cantons. On the due fulfilment of these conditions,\r\nthe French troops should be drawn off likewise; and should not again\r\nenter the Swiss territory, unless the government called for their\r\nassistance.\r\n\r\nOn the very day when Brune had given his insolent ultimatum, Erlach\r\nentered the great council at Bern, accompanied by eighty of his officers,\r\nwho were members, like himself, of that body. In a moment of unusual\r\nresolution, he was invested with full powers to commence hostilities on\r\nthe close of the armistice. However, two days afterwards, the delegates\r\nreturned from Brune’s encampment at Payerne. Erlach and his brothers\r\nin arms were no longer present in council; the rest of that body were\r\nparalysed by the imminent and gigantic danger; and the full powers which\r\nhad just been given the general were taken away. The same evening,\r\nErlach received instructions _not_ to attack the French, which fired his\r\ntroops with anger and suspicion, and tended to confirm the belief in the\r\ntreachery of their leaders, already widely prevalent in the army. Brune’s\r\nultimatum, in all its principal features, was accepted. The delegates\r\nof Zurich, Wyss, and Tscharner sought a conference with him, when he\r\nrenewed his former offers in cold and peremptory language; but now added\r\na novel stipulation to them, namely, that, even after the confederate\r\ntroops were disbanded, his should remain till the new constitution\r\nshould be established. It was affirmed, truly or otherwise, that he\r\ngranted, without difficulty, an extension of the truce for twenty-four\r\nhours; notwithstanding which, the delegates, on their return, saw his\r\ntroops already in motion for the attack. Orders for the commencement of\r\nhostilities had also been forwarded from the council of war at Bern to\r\nthe army, and two hours afterwards, retracted.\r\n\r\nIn obedience to the first of these contradictory instructions, the\r\nBernese colonel Gross had given notice to the French outposts that\r\nthe truce would come to an end at ten in the evening of the 1st of\r\nMarch; but when he withdrew his former announcement on the arrival\r\nof counter-orders, Schauenburg would admit no further parley. He had\r\nalready attacked, without warning, the old castle of Dornach, in the\r\nneighbourhood of Bâle, which sustained a siege of twenty-four hours. The\r\nattack of a Bernese division near Vingels was repulsed with loss, and\r\nthe French surprised the Bernese posts at Lengnau, which they carried\r\nafter an obstinate resistance. The town of Solothurn capitulated, on\r\nSchauenburg’s appearance before it. The passage across the Aar now lay\r\nopen to the French troops. Fribourg was attacked and taken, though a\r\nstand was made by the Bernese garrison.\r\n\r\nErlach was now compelled to withdraw his troops behind the Aar and the\r\nSense; though it was not without extreme reluctance that the men of\r\nBern abandoned Morat. On the 3rd of March, Brune destroyed one of the\r\nfinest monuments of Swiss courage and union, the Ossuary of Morat; and\r\nthe French, among whom were many natives of Burgundy, honoured the bones\r\nof their ancestors with a grave, after an interval of more than three\r\nhundred years. Now at length, Bern, Solothurn, and Fribourg proclaimed\r\na levy _en masse_ of the able-bodied men within their territories. The\r\nBernese army was in a dreadful state of confusion; particularly that\r\ndivision which stood directly opposed to Brune, in which the distrust\r\nand exasperation of the soldiers were at their highest pitch. Officers\r\nwere dismissed by their soldiers, and others put in their place. Colonels\r\nStettler and Ryhiner were bayonetted and shot before the very gates of\r\nBern; and Colonels Crusez and Goumoens fell beneath the sabre-strokes of\r\ntheir own dragoons. Nevertheless, the troops were again assembled under\r\ncommand of Grafenried, who was admirably supported by his officers, and\r\nrepulsed the French in every attempt to charge them at the point of the\r\nbayonet. Eighteen cannons were taken from the enemy, and their loss in\r\nmen besides was very considerable.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Capitulation of Berne; the Constitution Unitaire (1798 A.D.)_\r\n\r\nThe native troops had now fully recovered spirit and confidence; but\r\njust as Grafenried prepared to cross the Sense at Neueneck, the decisive\r\nintelligence arrived that Bern was in the hands of the enemy! Early\r\non the 5th, an attack had been made by Schauenburg on Solothurn. His\r\nforce was far numerically superior to the Bernese; his horse artillery\r\nterrified the native militia by its novelty, and his cavalry was nearly\r\neight-fold that of Bern in numbers. At Fraubrunnen, the French turned\r\nthe left flank of the Bernese: in the Grauholz and at Breitenfeld their\r\nmilitia under Erlach offered a brave resistance, armed with scythes and\r\nother agricultural implements. Men, women, and even children mixed,\r\nand fell in the mortal struggle. On its unsuccessful issue, ensued the\r\ncapitulation of Bern.\r\n\r\nAll was lost: the armed bands of the peasantry dispersed in every\r\ndirection with loud accusations of treason against their officers, many\r\nof whom were slain by their own men. Amongst these was the general\r\nErlach, an illustrious name in the annals of Bern. That unfortunate\r\ncommander, and the avoyer Steiger, when the fortune of the day was\r\ndecided, retreated towards the Oberland, whither they knew that arms and\r\nmoney had already been despatched by the government, and where they still\r\nhoped to offer an effective resistance. But Erlach was murdered in the\r\nway by the enraged fugitives, who breathed nothing but revenge for their\r\nimaginary betrayal, and it was only by chance that Steiger did not meet a\r\nsimilar fate.\r\n\r\nEven public extremity could not restore public spirit. Every little\r\ncanton treated, armed, and cared for itself exclusively, totally\r\nregardless of the rest. Wherever the authorities had, till then,\r\nwithheld freedom from their subjects, they no longer delayed to grant it;\r\nbut bestowed emancipation with so ill a grace, as to indicate how gladly\r\nthey would have refused it, had they dared.\r\n\r\nFrance now assumed a tone of direct command, and proclaimed the\r\ndissolution of the Helvetic body, and the establishment of a\r\n_constitution unitaire_, embracing the whole of Switzerland under one\r\nuniform system of government. This system announced a perfect equality of\r\nrights between the inhabitants of the towns and of the villages, assigned\r\nthe nomination of judges, magistrates, and legislators, to the people\r\nin their primary assemblies, and entrusted to the government the choice\r\nof executive functionaries. The founders of this new Helvetic republic\r\nnext proceeded to the more material objects of their mission. They levied\r\nlarge contributions on the towns, appropriated the treasures amassed at\r\nBern, Zurich, Solothurn, and Fribourg, and carried off many members of\r\ncouncil and other persons, as hostages for the further payments exacted\r\nfrom those places.\r\n\r\nBut the people of Uri, Nidwalden, Schwyz, and Glarus, were resolved not\r\nto deliver up their old independence so easily, and organised a heroic,\r\nthough a useless, resistance under their brave leader Aloys Reding.\r\nThe most brilliant and the most sanguinary struggle took place at\r\nRothenthurm, in the neighbourhood of the battle-field of Morgarten. These\r\nAlpine shepherds combated with a spirit and success which showed them\r\nnot unworthy of their forefathers. Thrice were the attacks of regular\r\ntroops, four times their number, repulsed, with serious loss on the\r\nside of the enemy. But the vigour of this peasant militia was exhausted\r\nby their very successes, and they were, finally, compelled to accept\r\nterms from the invaders, and to bow beneath the yoke of the Helvetic\r\nRepublic. Thus ended the old Swiss confederation, after enduring for a\r\nterm of nearly five centuries. “It fell,” says an enlightened native\r\nhistorian,[1] “not exactly for want of strength in the bands which held\r\nit together; for, without any stronger bond of union the old confederates\r\nwon their freedom, crushed or repelled the force of mighty antagonists,\r\nand rendered themselves powerful and formidable. The Swiss succumbed in\r\nthe last unfortunate struggle, because the feeling of duty, the lofty\r\nfaith in their country and its fortunes, had become chilled in the bosoms\r\nof the many, and because the democratical cantons thought of none but\r\nthemselves.”\r\n\r\nWhile the well-instructed friends of their country regretted the rude\r\nviolence with which every link in the system of society, from the Alps\r\nto the Jura, had been totally torn away from its ancient holdings,\r\nthey could not fail to perceive the ultimate benefits educible from\r\nthe general convulsion. The former aggregation of little states had\r\nbeen productive of estrangement and enmity; the cantons had been proved\r\npowerless, even for self-defence; separately too poor for public\r\nenterprises; collectively incapable of any combined action. But now an\r\nopportunity seemed to be given to the Swiss people of becoming one great\r\nfamily, enjoying equal rights. The mass of the people, however, was not\r\npenetrated by such ideas, and only deplored the breach made in their old\r\nhabits and usages. They had, indeed, demanded freedom and independence,\r\nbut not this melting up into an uniform mass. They would have preferred\r\nthat every petty district, nay, every single valley, should become a free\r\nand independent canton, ruling itself in its own assemblies, according\r\nto its own pleasure, and only connected by federal ties with the rest of\r\nthe Swiss people. The whole subsequent march of events tended only to\r\nincrease the desire for a subdivided federative system of this kind, and\r\nthe aversion for the newly established order. The new general government,\r\ncalled an executive directory, after its prototype at Paris, resided\r\nat Aarau without inspiring either respect or confidence, dependent on\r\nits sole protectors, the French plenipotentiaries. In the senate and\r\nthe great council, composed of delegates from all the cantons, the\r\nconflicting opinions of parties caused an incessant wordy warfare. Out\r\nof doors the same parties abandoned parliamentary weapons, and asserted\r\ntheir discordant creeds with arms in their hands. New and old laws and\r\nregulations were perpetually coming in collision. While the state was\r\noften without the most indispensable means for its maintenance, and even\r\nfor the daily pay of its functionaries, the French plenipotentiaries,\r\nleaders, and subalterns, rioted in shameless superfluities at the cost of\r\nthe country, and sent to France the surplus of their plunder.\r\n\r\nThe discontents of the people were considerably aggravated by the murmurs\r\nand manœuvres of the ci-devant authorities; of the monks who apprehended\r\nthe abolition of all monasteries; of the priests who had suffered\r\ndiminution of the stipends, and of the traders and artisans in the towns\r\nwho no longer enjoyed the sweets of corporations and monopolies. They\r\ntrusted to the approaching renewal of war between France and Austria,\r\nand prepared to support the emperor for the expulsion of the French.\r\nWhen the whole population was summoned, in July, 1798, to take the oath\r\nof allegiance to the newly formed constitution, disturbances and revolts\r\ntook place in many districts.[c]\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES\r\n\r\n[1] Ludwig Meyer.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI. SWITZERLAND SINCE 1798\r\n\r\n\r\nCHANGES OF CONSTITUTIONS AND ADMINISTRATIONS\r\n\r\nWar with France was at length renewed by the emperor of Austria, and\r\na division of his army entered the Grisons. A signal defeat sustained\r\nby the French troops near Stockach, in Swabia, the victorious advance\r\nof the Austrian army into Switzerland, and the removal of the seat of\r\nthe Helvetic government from Lucerne to Bern, seemed to inspire the\r\nconflicting parties with renewed animation and fury. Swiss fought against\r\nSwiss under the banners of France and Austria; tumults and revolts took\r\nplace on account of the French conscription or in favour of the Austrian\r\ninvasion; battles were fought between foreign armies in the valleys, on\r\nthe Alps, and on the banks of the lakes; and horse and man clambered\r\nover heights which had formerly been only known to the chamois hunter.\r\nThe Grisons and the mountainous lands as far as the St. Gotthard were\r\nalternately won and lost by French and Germans. The victorious banners of\r\nAustria were carried on the left as far as Zurich and the St. Gotthard,\r\non the right up to the banks of the Rhine, supported by the Russians\r\nunder Suvarov. Switzerland had never sustained such desolating inroads\r\nsince the times of the Romans, Alamanni, and Burgundians.\r\n\r\nMany of the old superseded members of the government now looked forward\r\nto the speedy restoration of their authority, which they here and there\r\nattempted to recover with the assistance of the Austrian bayonets: even\r\nthe new abbot of St. Gall resumed the exercise of his feudal rights, such\r\nas they had existed before the recent emancipation which had been granted\r\nto the people. The effects of this iniquitous resumption did not fail\r\nsoon to be felt by the proud prelate himself; Zurich and Schaffhausen,\r\ntoo, were soon forced to acknowledge that the people did not wish to be\r\nreplaced in its state of subjection. The decisive and brilliant victory\r\nof Massena near Zurich, and the destruction of Suvarov’s army, which had\r\nmarched over the Alps from Italy, restored the Helvetic constitution\r\nthroughout the whole country. Parties now supplanted and succeeded each\r\nother in quick succession, so that none could remain long at the helm or\r\nconsult for the public benefit.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [1801 A.D.]]\r\n\r\nFirst of all, the legislative councils dissolved the executive directory,\r\nand substituted for it an executive committee; then, in its turn, this\r\nexecutive committee dissolved the councils, convoked a new legislature,\r\nand styled itself an executive council. Twelve months afterwards a\r\ngeneral Helvetic diet was assembled at Bern for the formation of a new\r\nand improved constitution: this, like the former deliberative bodies, was\r\narbitrarily deposed from its functions, and a newest-of-all constitution\r\nestablished, in October, 1801. Alois Reding, the victor of Rothenthurm,\r\nas the foremost Swiss landammann, was placed at the head of the senate;\r\nbut as he possessed neither the confidence of the French rulers nor that\r\nof those who detested all recurrence to the old state of things, a new\r\nact of arbitrary power deposed him from the presidency of the council.\r\n\r\nThese continual changes of administration were looked upon with\r\nabsolute indifference by the Swiss people, who only sighed at the total\r\ninterruption of law and order, the increase of taxes, and the lawless\r\nacts of the French soldiery. The Valais more particularly suffered by the\r\nmilitary tyranny to which it was subjected. The object of France was to\r\nseparate it from Switzerland, in order to keep a route open across the\r\nAlps into Italy.\r\n\r\nIn the same degree as popular consideration ceased to attend the\r\never-changing but equally odious aspects of the new government,\r\nindividual opinions and wild fancies obtained prevalence. Mystical\r\nviews were propagated in Appenzell; and the anabaptists reared their\r\nheads once more in Bern and Zurich. The quiet of the former town and\r\nits neighbourhood was suddenly disturbed by a swarm of fanatics from\r\nAmsoldingen. Two years before, a quack doctor and fanatic, by name Antony\r\nUnternerer, had fixed his abode in that village. A certain flow of\r\nlanguage, combined with prepossessing manners and the profuse employment\r\nof benedictory formulas in human diseases, as well as in those of cattle,\r\nhad gained for this fellow the confidence of the multitude. He held\r\nmeetings in which particular parts of the New Testament were interpreted\r\nin a new and peculiar manner; and his adherents ceased their attendance\r\non the ordinary divine service. Unternerer addressed a summons in writing\r\nto the supreme tribunal of Bern, to appear, with all its prisoners and\r\ntheir keepers, in the cathedral church on the morning of Good Friday,\r\nwhen the Saviour of the world would ascend the pulpit and hold his\r\njudgment. He also summoned all his disciples to meet at Bern on the same\r\nday. Many of them had already remained during several days assembled\r\ntogether; and, anticipating the coming judgment, had transferred their\r\nworldly possessions to others. Curiosity drew a multitude together\r\nfrom all quarters. Unternerer himself was announced as Saviour by\r\nhis adherents; and seditious projects peeped out under the mantle of\r\nfanaticism. However, such a wholesome effect was produced by the arrest\r\nof the ringleader, the consignment of his most conspicuous followers to\r\nthe lunatic hospital, and the billetting of dragoons in the houses of\r\nothers, that the poor enthusiasts soon came to their senses, lamenting\r\nthe error of their ways and the transfer of their properties.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE EVACUATION OF SWITZERLAND; THE NOMINATION OF DEPUTIES (1802-1803 A.D.)\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [1802-1803 A.D.]]\r\n\r\nThe Peace of Amiens, betwixt France and the other belligerent powers\r\nin consequence of which the French garrisons were drawn home out of\r\nSwitzerland, afforded opportunity to the party and provincial spirit\r\nto show itself with new vigour. On the 12th of July Montrichard, the\r\nFrench resident in Switzerland, communicated in an extra-official note\r\nto the Helvetic landammann, Dolder, that he had received commands from\r\nthe minister of war to hold himself, with the troops under his orders,\r\nin readiness for instant return to France. The landammann laid this note\r\nbefore the then executive council, who were considerably embarrassed by\r\nits import, and addressed themselves to Montrichard and to the Swiss\r\nambassador at Paris, to petition for a postponement of the measure. But\r\nshortly afterwards, Boizot, secretary of the Helvetic embassy, arrived\r\nfrom Paris with Talleyrand’s note, which fixed for the approaching 20th\r\nof July the complete evacuation of Switzerland. It was now out of the\r\nquestion for the heads of the Helvetic government to oppose themselves\r\nto a measure invoked by the wishes of a large majority. Accordingly\r\nthe executive council did its best to assume an unconstrained and easy\r\nattitude; and with all expedition voted its liveliest thanks to the first\r\nconsul for his purpose of withdrawing his troops from Switzerland, which\r\nthey hailed as the highest proof of his benevolence and respect for the\r\nindependence of the Helvetic nation.\r\n\r\nThe reply of the French minister was couched in terms of disinterested\r\ndelicacy, which almost seemed ironical. He talked of the French troops\r\nas the battalions which the first consul had consented to leave in\r\nSwitzerland on the conclusion of peace. He based the proposed measure\r\non the confidence entertained by the first consul in the virtues of\r\nthe Helvetic people, who were now better agreed, as he said, on the\r\nprinciples of political organisation, and in whose attachment the\r\ngovernment would find sufficient securities for the maintenance of order\r\nand tranquillity. “The Helvetic government could regard this resolution\r\nbut as a pledge of the consul’s confidence in its friendly intentions and\r\npolicy, and of his disinclination to meddle with the internal affairs of\r\nother nations.”\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to assign with any certainty the motives by which this\r\nambiguous language and conduct were dictated. The first consul may have\r\nmeant to give a popular example of moderation and respect for the faith\r\nof treaties; or he may have designed a covert chastisement for the\r\nfeeble attempts at independence made by the Helvetic government and its\r\nrefusal of unconditional acquiescence in the projected separation of\r\nthe Valais; or he may have wished to extort an express prayer for the\r\nstay of his troops, or to revive the struggle of parties, and compel the\r\nHelvetic government to throw itself into the arms of France, and urge\r\nhim, as though against his will, to assume the part of arbiter and ruler;\r\nor, finally, perhaps, the best solution of his conduct may be found by\r\nsupposing the combination of all or most of these motives.\r\n\r\nConformably with the system thus enforced upon them, the executive\r\ncouncil made known to the Swiss people the departure of the French\r\ntroops, as a gracious boon the offer of which they had eagerly accepted.\r\nIn effect, the removal of these troops was performed with such celerity\r\nthat none were left behind but the sick in the hospitals and a handful of\r\nmen here and there to guard whatever French property was not of a movable\r\ndescription.\r\n\r\nThe news of the retreat of the French troops and the ill-concealed\r\nuneasiness of the government flew through the country with wonderful\r\nrapidity, and everywhere roused the concealed but numerous enemies of\r\nthe existing order, who had hitherto lurked inactively, as it were in\r\nscattered cantonments. The Valais declared itself independent. Uri,\r\nSchwyz, and Unterwalden took up arms against the Helvetic government.\r\nThe town of Zurich, likewise, threw off allegiance to it--an example\r\nwhich was speedily followed by Schaffhausen and Bâle. A general levy\r\ntook place in the Aargau against Bern: the helpless Helvetic government\r\nfled for refuge to Lausanne, while a diet was held in Schwyz for the\r\nrestoration of the old league. The feeble body of troops in the pay of\r\nthe government were driven from the interior of the country, and followed\r\ntheir employers into the Vaud: everywhere the opposite factions prepared\r\nfor active hostilities; the towns planned the destruction of the general\r\ngovernment; the peasants armed for their freedom against the pretensions\r\nof the towns; and the Pays de Vaud arrayed itself in defence of Helvetic\r\nunity. Blood had already flowed, and civil war appeared inevitable, when\r\nNapoleon turned his eyes again upon Switzerland, and commanded peace in a\r\ntone which was not apt to meet with resistance.\r\n\r\n“Inhabitants of Switzerland” (such were the terms of a declaration\r\naddressed by him through General Rapp to the cantons of the Helvetic\r\nRepublic): “you have presented, during two years, a melancholy spectacle.\r\nSovereign power has alternately been seized by opposite factions, whose\r\ntransitory and partial sway has only served to illustrate their own\r\nincapacity and weakness. If you are left to yourselves any longer,\r\nyou will cut one another to pieces for years, without any prospect of\r\ncoming to a rational understanding. Your intestine discord never could\r\nbe terminated without the effective interposition of France. I had\r\nresolved not to mix in your affairs; but I cannot and will not view with\r\nindifference those calamities to which I now perceive you exposed. I\r\nretract my former resolution. I offer myself as your mediator, and will\r\nexert my mediation with that energy which becomes the powerful nation in\r\nwhose name I speak. Five days after reception of the present declaration,\r\nthe senate shall assemble at Bern to nominate three deputies to be\r\nsent to Paris, and each canton will also be admitted to send delegates\r\nthither. All citizens who have held public employments during the last\r\nthree years may also appear at Paris to deliberate by what means may\r\nbest be effected the restoration of concord and the reconciliation of\r\nparties. Every rational man must perceive that my purposed mediation is\r\na blessing conferred on Switzerland by that providence which, amidst so\r\nmany concurring causes of social dissolution, has always preserved your\r\nnational existence and independence. It would be painful to think that\r\ndestiny had singled out this epoch, which has called to life so many new\r\nrepublics, as the hour of destruction to one of the oldest commonwealths\r\nin Europe.”\r\n\r\nThe Helvetic senate instantly replied to this announcement by declaring\r\nthat it received, with lively gratitude, this new proof of the friendly\r\ndispositions of the first consul, and would conduct itself in all points\r\nin conformity with his wishes. In a proclamation addressed to the\r\nHelvetic people, after some allusion to the mighty and uplifted arm of\r\nthe mediator, it recommended union, tranquillity, and calm expectation.\r\nThe cantonal diets met to elect deputies to Paris. The several communes\r\nalso were permitted to despatch delegates thither at their own expense.\r\nThe mandate of Napoleon and the presence of his soldiers induced\r\nconflicting parties to suspend their hostilities, and tacitly, at least,\r\nto acquiesce in his mediation, as they could come to no agreement with\r\neach other.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [1803-1813 A.D.]]\r\n\r\nOn the 10th of December, 1803, Swiss delegates were received in the\r\noffice of foreign affairs at Paris, to hear a note of Bonaparte read,\r\nin which he addressed them as president of the French and Cisalpine\r\nrepublics, and laid down the basis of his intended mediation. “A federal\r\nconstitution,” he said, “is a point of prime necessity for you. Nature\r\nherself has adapted Switzerland for it. What you want is an equality\r\nof rights among the cantons, a renunciation of all family privileges,\r\nand the independent federative organisation of each canton. The central\r\nconstitution may be easily arranged afterwards. The main points for your\r\npeople are neutrality, promotion of trade, and frugal administration:\r\nthis is what I have always said to your delegates when they asked my\r\nadvice; but the very men who seemed to be the best aware of its truth\r\nturned out to be the most obstinately wedded to their privileges. They\r\nattached themselves, and looked for support, to the enemies of France.\r\nThe first acts of your insurgents were to appeal to the privileged\r\norders, annihilate equality, and insult the French people. No party\r\nshall triumph; no counter-revolution take place. In case of violation of\r\nneutrality, your government must decide upon making common cause with\r\nFrance.”\r\n\r\nOn the 12th, Bonaparte received a select number of the Swiss deputation\r\nto whom he further addressed himself as follows: “The only constitution\r\nfit for Switzerland, considering its small extent and its poverty,\r\nis such a one as shall not involve an oppressive load of taxation.\r\nFederalism weakens larger states by splitting their forces, while\r\nit strengthens small ones by leaving a free range to individual\r\nenergies.” He added, with an openness peculiar to great characters, and\r\nunequivocally indicative of good will, “When I make any demand of an\r\nindividual, he does not often dare to refuse it; but if I am forced to\r\napply myself to a crowd of cantonal governments, each of them may declare\r\nitself incompetent to answer. A diet is called: a few months’ time is\r\ngained; and the storm blows over.”\r\n\r\nAlmost every word of the first consul during these negotiations has\r\nhistorical value. Most of his expressions wear a character of greatness;\r\nall of them afford a clue to the system on which he acted. One or two\r\npassages, taken at random here and there, will suffice for a specimen:\r\n“It is the democratic cantons which distinguish you, and draw on you the\r\neyes of the world. It is they which do not allow the thought of melting\r\nyou up with other states to gain any coherence or consistency. The\r\npermission to settle wherever they please, in pursuit of their vocation,\r\nmust be extended to all natives of Switzerland. The small cantons are\r\nsaid to be averse to this principle; but who on earth would ever think of\r\ntroubling them by settling amongst them? France will re-open a source of\r\nprofit in favour of these poorer cantons, by taking additional regiments\r\ninto her pay. France will do this, not because she needs additional\r\ntroops but because she feels an interest in attaching these democracies.”\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ACT OF MEDIATION (1813 A.D.); CABALS FOLLOW NAPOLEON’S FALL\r\n\r\nThe Act of Mediation, which resulted from these conferences, restored\r\nthe old federative system; but not without introducing very considerable\r\nimprovements. The amnesty announced by it precluded all persecutions,\r\nand the new agitations necessarily arising from them. All servitude and\r\nall privilege were abolished; while equality of rights and freedom of\r\nindustry were established. The mischievous freedom formerly enjoyed by\r\nthe several cantons of entering into hostilities or alliances against\r\neach other was quite put an end to. In future, they could only use their\r\narms against the common enemy; and the objects of the whole league could\r\nno longer be frustrated by the humours of its individual members.\r\n\r\nThe dissolution of the Helvetic general government followed naturally\r\non the completion of the above-mentioned arrangements; and soon\r\nafterwards Napoleon recalled his troops from Switzerland. The people,\r\nin almost every part of the country, returned quietly to their usual\r\noccupations, and tendered their allegiance to the new order of things.\r\nIn the canton of Zurich alone several communes refused the oaths;\r\ncomplaining of the difficulties newly thrown in the way of the redemption\r\nof tithes, ground-rent, and other burdens. They would listen to no\r\nfriendly representations; but committed acts of violence on unoffending\r\nfunctionaries, set fire to the castle of Wadenschwyl, and finally took\r\nto arms. The prolonged disorders of former years had accustomed them to\r\nlawless self-defence; but the insurrection was soon suppressed by the aid\r\nof the neighbouring cantons, combined with the well-affected part of the\r\nZurichers.\r\n\r\nThe ringleader John James Willi, shoemaker in the village of Horgen,\r\nand others of his more conspicuous comrades, were punished with death.\r\nThe less distinguished rioters suffered imprisonment, and forty-two\r\noffending communes were visited with a war-tax of above 200,000 florins.\r\nIt was well that the first flame of revolt was speedily extinguished,\r\nbefore it had time to spread itself through the country. Parties remained\r\neverywhere unreconciled; and each imagined nothing to be required\r\nfor their predominance but the fall of the new order of things. The\r\nfriends of Helvetic unity still murmured at the cantonal partition of\r\nthe country. The monasteries murmured as they felt their existence\r\nthreatened; and Pancrace, the _ci-devant_ abbot of St. Gall, openly\r\nstigmatised the inhabitants of that district as contumacious vassals\r\nof the empire. Many of the country people murmured, who wished for\r\n_Landsgemeinde_, on the model of the original cantons. Many patrician and\r\ncity families murmured that their privileges were swept away, and the\r\npeasantry no longer their subjects. The majority of the people, however,\r\nwished for nothing but peace and quiet, and decidedly adhered to the\r\nexisting order of things, and the rights which they had acquired under\r\nthat order.\r\n\r\nThus the peace of the country remained for the most part undisturbed; and\r\na series of comparatively prosperous years followed. The energies of the\r\nSwiss had been awakened by the years of revolution and of civil war, and\r\ndisplayed themselves in a hitherto unprecedented degree. They no longer\r\nstood apart from each other as formerly, like strangers; but had been\r\nmade better acquainted by the storms of social collision. The concerns of\r\neach canton were now interesting to all. Journals and newspapers, which\r\nhad formerly been suppressed by timid governments, instructed the people\r\nin useful knowledge, and drew its attention to public affairs. The Swiss\r\nof all cantons formed societies for the furtherance of objects of common\r\nutility, for the encouragement of various arts and sciences, and for the\r\nmaintenance of concord and patriotism. The canal of the Linth formed a\r\nlasting monument of this newly reawakened public spirit.\r\n\r\nSince the people had ceased to be viewed as in a state of perpetual\r\ninfancy a new impulse was given to trade and industry, which were now\r\nno longer cramped and confined, as formerly, by corporate restrictions\r\nand monopolies. The participation in public affairs allowed to all free\r\ncitizens enforced a mild and equitable conduct on the governments.\r\nSchools were increased and improved throughout the country; the military\r\nforce was newly organised; and, on the whole, a greater number of\r\nlaudable objects were provided for in the space of ten years than had\r\nbeen thought of in the previous century.\r\n\r\nWhen the throne of Napoleon sank under the power of the allies, the\r\npublic-spirited part of the Swiss nation fondly imagined that the hour\r\nwas come in which their country’s honour and independence might be\r\nestablished on a firmer footing than ever. To preserve the benefits\r\ngained to the land by his act of mediation was the wish of a large\r\nmajority of the people. If the Swiss had sometimes felt, along with\r\nothers, the iron arm of that formidable despot (who had, however,\r\nspared them more than any neighbouring population), yet his gift of\r\na constitution had become deservedly dear to them. It had dried up\r\ninnumerable sources of discord. Under it a fellow-feeling, never before\r\nexperienced, had been diffused in the same degree as individual pride\r\nhad been humbled. The cessation of a state of subjection, wherever it\r\nhad before existed, had decupled the number of confederates, and all\r\nrestraints on free communication betwixt one canton and another had been\r\nremoved.\r\n\r\nThe cantons sent their contingents for the protection of the frontiers,\r\nvoted extraordinary imposts for their maintenance, and a diet was\r\nassembled at Zurich with unanimous instructions from its constituents.\r\nThis body declared with one voice its resolution “to observe a\r\nconscientious and impartial neutrality with regard to all the high\r\nbelligerent powers,” expressing, at the same time, its full anticipation\r\nthat “the same would be acknowledged upon their part.” It addressed\r\nitself as follows to the confederates: “The great and only end of all our\r\nendeavours is to maintain this neutrality by every means in our power;\r\nto protect our country’s freedom and independence; to preserve its soil\r\ninviolate, and to defend its constitution.” The senate of Bern expressed\r\nitself as follows: “Our object is to guard the pacific borders of our\r\ncountry inviolate from the march of foreign armies; we are unanimously\r\nresolved, however, at all events, to maintain tranquillity, order, and\r\nsecurity in our canton by all the means which stand in our power.”\r\n\r\nSuch was the general sense of the Swiss people. Not such, however,\r\nwas the sense of the great families in the once dominant towns of the\r\nconfederation. Many of these wished to see their country invaded by\r\nforeign armies, by aid of which they hoped to restore the old league of\r\nthe thirteen cantons, with all its hated appendages of sovereignty and\r\nservitude, which had vanished from the face of the land in 1798.\r\n\r\nThe Swiss delegates were received in a friendly manner by the emperor\r\nof Austria and the king of Prussia; but no direct recognition of their\r\nneutrality was vouchsafed to them. The satellites of these monarchs\r\ngave them distinctly to understand that Switzerland was regarded and\r\nwould be treated as nothing else than as a limb of the French system.\r\nA large Austrian force was collected on the frontiers, particularly in\r\nthe neighbourhood of Bâle; yet many still believed that a determined\r\nvindication of neutrality would not be put down by violence. In the\r\nmeantime, the Swiss delegates were stopped at Fribourg in Brisgau\r\non their return homewards from Frankfort, and their letters were\r\nintercepted. A general enervation seemed to have spread itself over the\r\nconduct of the affairs of the confederation at this crisis. There is\r\nno ground for supposing that the men who led their forces and presided\r\nin their governments acted the part of secret conspirators against the\r\norder of things which they professed to defend. But when the overwhelming\r\npowers of the allies came pouring in upon them; when these were joined\r\nby kings who owed their crowns to Napoleon; when even the French\r\nambassador dissuaded reinforcement of the frontier cordon--when, in\r\nshort, the ancient state of things renewed its sway on every side, while\r\na decided popular will showed itself nowhere, opposition was in a manner\r\noverwhelmed by the force of circumstances.\r\n\r\nA proclamation, couched in terms of mildness and of amity, was issued\r\nby Prince Schwarzenberg, the Austrian commander-in-chief; and at the\r\nsame time Count Capo d’Istria declared, on his arrival in Zurich,\r\nthat the monarchs could not recognise a neutrality which, in the\r\nexisting situation of Switzerland, must be nothing more than nominal.\r\nThe armies of the allied powers hoped to find none but friends there.\r\nTheir majesties pledged themselves solemnly not to lay down their arms\r\nuntil they should have secured the restoration to Switzerland of the\r\nterritories wrested from her by France--a pledge which we shall presently\r\nsee was adhered to but indifferently. They disclaimed all wish to meddle\r\nwith her internal constitution; but at the same time could not allow her\r\nto remain under foreign influence. They would recognise her neutrality\r\nfrom that day in which she became free and independent.\r\n\r\nThe Austrian army marched over the Rhine on the 21st of December, 1813,\r\nthrough the territories of Bâle, Aargau, Solothurn, and Bern, into\r\nFrance. During the first months of the following year the burdens and\r\neven the dangers of war were felt very severely in the northern and\r\nwestern parts of Switzerland, particularly in Bâle, which received\r\nmuch annoyance from the obstinate defence of Hüningen, and the hostile\r\ndisposition of the commander of that place. Geneva, too, while she\r\nwelcomed in anticipation the new birth of her ancient independence, saw\r\nherself suddenly surrounded with the actual horrors of warfare, and\r\nthreatened with a regular siege. The continual passage of large bodies\r\nof troops brought malignant fevers and maladies in their train, and it\r\nbecame more and more difficult to supply them with provisions.\r\n\r\nOn the entrance of the Austrian troops, Bern set the example of\r\nabolishing the Act of Mediation, and reclaimed the restoration of the\r\npredominance which she had previously enjoyed in the Helvetic body.\r\nThe example was followed first by Solothurn and Fribourg, and then by\r\nLucerne. In Zurich, too, the diet declared the Act of Mediation, by\r\nvirtue of which it was sitting, null and void, and drew up a plan for a\r\nnew confederation of the nineteen cantons. But this was not enough for\r\nsome of the men in power at that time, who demanded nothing short of the\r\nrestoration of the old league of the thirteen cantons, and had already\r\nsummoned the Pays de Vaud and the Aargau to return under the government\r\nof Bern. These cantons, however, resolutely rejected the proposal.\r\n\r\nThe diet, which was again convoked at Zurich and consisted of delegates\r\nnewly elected by all the nineteen cantons, was now the only feeble bond\r\nwhich kept the Helvetic body together. Interested voices were raised on\r\nevery side for annihilating or mutilating the last constructed cantons,\r\nwhich for sixteen years had enjoyed the boon of freedom and independence.\r\nZug demanded a part of its former subject lands from the Aargau; Uri,\r\nthe Valle Levantina from the canton of Ticino; Glarus, the district of\r\nSargans from the canton of St. Gall; the prince abbot Pancrace, his\r\nformer domains and sovereignties in the Thurgau; Schwyz and Glarus\r\ncombined to demand compensation for their privileges over the districts\r\nof Utznach, Gaster, Wesen, and Ersatz; Unterwalden, Uri, and Schwyz\r\nunited in a similar demand for compensation for the sovereign rights\r\nwhich had formerly been possessed by them in Aargau, Thurgau, St. Gall,\r\nand on the Ticino.\r\n\r\nIn these cabals and commotions Zurich, Bâle, and Schaffhausen displayed\r\nthe least of prejudice or passion; while the Aargau and the Vaud showed\r\nthemselves worthy of their freedom by the spirited resolution of their\r\npeople. In the lands and towns of Bâle, Solothurn, and Zurich it was\r\nproposed to espouse the cause and rally round the standard of the Aargau.\r\nBern, however, avoided open hostilities, and even offered to recognise\r\nthe independence of the Vaud on certain conditions, which were rejected\r\nby the latter. Aargau now made menacing demonstrations, and a dangerous\r\nferment showed itself in the Oberland. Here, as in many other places,\r\nthe jealousy and suspicion of the various parties came into play, in\r\nproportion as discussion was broached on the limits to be assigned to\r\nthe rights of the people and their governments. News was daily received\r\nof scattered plots and insurrections, of imprisonments and banishments,\r\nin various places. The town of Solothurn called for the protection of\r\na Bernese garrison against the threatened attacks of its own people.\r\nSwiss troops were precipitately despatched to the banks of the Ticino to\r\nprevent the breaking out of civil war; while other troops were sent into\r\nthe canton of St. Gall to put an end to a scene of absolute confusion.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [1815 A.D.]]\r\n\r\nWhile Switzerland was thus given up to a state of such disquietude\r\nthat blood had already flowed in more than one district, and the gaols\r\nof several towns were filled with prisoners, the plenipotentiaries of\r\nthe great powers were sitting in congress at Vienna, to establish the\r\npeace of Europe on a durable foundation. The allies had already allowed\r\nthe addition to the Helvetic body of Geneva, as well as of the Valais,\r\nand the Prussian principality of Neuchâtel. Swiss delegates made their\r\nappearance with equal promptitude in the imperial metropolis on the\r\nDanube, as they had done eleven years before in the capital of France.\r\n\r\nBut the politics of Europe moved no faster at Vienna than those of\r\nSwitzerland did at the diet of Zurich. No settlement of Swiss affairs\r\nhad been made, when the sudden news of Napoleon’s landing from Elba and\r\nhis triumphal march through France awakened European diplomacy once more\r\nfrom its slumbers. The diet called to arms the half contingent of fifteen\r\nthousand men for the defence of the frontiers. Two battalions of the Vaud\r\nwere detached hastily to Geneva, and the same canton received as friends\r\nand comrades the troops of Bern, against which it had taken up arms a\r\nmonth before. The most important elements of discord seemed to have\r\ndisappeared--the most inveterate enemies to be reconciled.\r\n\r\nOn the 20th of March, 1815, the definitive arrangements of the allied\r\npowers were promulgated. The existing nineteen cantons were recognised,\r\nand the increase of their number to two-and-twenty confirmed, by\r\nthe accession of Geneva, Neuchâtel, and the Valais. The canton of\r\nVaud received back the Dappenthal, which had been taken from it by\r\nFrance. Bienne and the bishopric of Bâle were given to Bern by way\r\nof compensation for its former sovereign rights over the Vaud. One\r\nmoiety of the customs received in the Vale Levantina was assigned to\r\nUri; the prince abbot Pancrace and his _ci-devant_ functionaries were\r\nindemnified with 8000 florins yearly. A decision was also given on the\r\nindemnification of those Bernese who had possessed jurisdictions in the\r\nPays de Vaud, and on many other points in dispute. The complaints of the\r\nGrisons alone were disregarded--Chiavenna, the Valtellina, and Bormio,\r\nwhich had now become the property of Austria, were neither restored nor\r\nwas any compensation for them given, notwithstanding the clause to the\r\ncontrary in Prince Schwarzenberg’s proclamation.\r\n\r\nThe cantons now remodelled their respective constitutions in the midst\r\nof agitations of all kinds. Those in which the supreme power is assigned\r\nto the _Landsgemeinde_ for the most part removed the restrictions on the\r\npopular prerogative, which had been introduced by the Act of Mediation,\r\nand approximated anew to pure democracy. In the city cantons the\r\ncapitals recovered, though in various modifications and proportions, a\r\npreponderance in the system of representation. Even in these privileged\r\nplaces, however, many friends of the public weal remained true to\r\nthe conviction tried and proved by past experience (and about to\r\nreceive after no long period additional confirmation from the march of\r\nevents)--that participation of the lesser towns and rural districts\r\nin public functions was a requisite condition for the permanence of\r\ntranquillity; and that the members introduced from these remoter parts of\r\nthe country would form vigorous roots of the slender stem of authority,\r\nand fix them wide and deep in a republican soil.\r\n\r\n\r\nSWITZERLAND DEVELOPS ALONG NEW LINES\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [1817-1823 A.D.]]\r\n\r\nIn 1817, the confederates were led by the invitation of the emperor\r\nAlexander into a signal deviation from the policy of their forefathers.\r\nThey entered into a close alliance with Austria, Russia, and Prussia; and\r\nallowed themselves to be mixed up with the system of the great powers, by\r\ngiving their adhesion to the Holy Alliance, unmindful of the lessons left\r\nby the Swiss of old times.\r\n\r\nOn the conclusion of the War of Liberation from Napoleon, an opinion\r\nwhich the allied powers had encouraged by their promises became prevalent\r\nthrough great part of Germany--that the efforts of the people should be\r\nrequited by the grant of representative constitutions. The realisation\r\nof this object was pursued by open and secret means, which soon aroused\r\nattention and mistrust on the part of the governments. Investigations\r\nwere set on foot, followed up by penal inflictions; and many of the\r\naccused parties made their escape into Switzerland. A similar course was\r\ntaken by some Italians, on the suppression of the Piedmontese revolts\r\nand the abortive revolution of Naples. Natives of France, moreover, who\r\nhad given offence to their government, either by republican principles\r\nor by adherence to the cause of Napoleon, in like manner sought a place\r\nof refuge in Switzerland. These occurrences did not fail to give umbrage\r\nto several cabinets, which was increased by the friendly welcome and\r\nassistance afforded to the fugitives from Greece. It never seemed to\r\noccur to foreign potentates what a blessing in the vicissitudes of\r\nEuropean affairs was the existence of a land to which political victims\r\nof all parties might resort as an inviolable sanctuary.\r\n\r\nThe year 1823, that of the French invasion of Spain under Louis XVIII,\r\nseemed an epoch of especially unfriendly dispositions in more than one\r\nEuropean court against Switzerland. There were personages who would\r\nwillingly have used these dispositions to effect some limitation of\r\nHelvetic independence; but their influence was either insufficient\r\nfor that purpose in the cabinets to which they belonged, or Europe\r\nseemed as yet not ripe for success in such an experiment. Meanwhile\r\nthe remonstrances and demands of continental powers afforded matter of\r\nanxious consultation to the Helvetic diet; and their usual subjects\r\nof discussion were increased by two new topics--foreign police and\r\nsurveillance of the press.\r\n\r\nIt was resolved that both these points touched the prerogatives of the\r\nseparate cantons, and therefore did not admit of decision at any general\r\ndiet. An invitation was accordingly issued to the governments of all the\r\ncantons, exhorting them to adopt vigorous measures, in order that nothing\r\nmight find its way into newspapers and journals inconsistent with proper\r\nrespect to friendly governments. With regard to foreign police it was\r\nproposed to take measures for preventing the entrance or residence of\r\nsuch strangers as had left their country on account of crimes or efforts\r\nat disturbance of the public repose; and for providing that no foreigners\r\nshould be admitted except such as could show certificates or passports\r\nfrom their respective governments.\r\n\r\nIn many of the cantons these demands were met by a ready alacrity not\r\nonly to urge their execution in their full extent but even to improve on\r\nthem by subjecting discussion of domestic as well as of foreign affairs\r\nto strict surveillance. On the other hand, in more enlightened parts of\r\nthe confederacy, it was thought that public discussion and the old right\r\nof sanctuary should be guarded from every species of encroachment. The\r\ndiets continued to busy themselves with deliberations on both subjects.\r\nReturning tranquillity diminished the uneasiness of the cabinets; and,\r\nby consequence their inquisitive and minute attention to Switzerland.\r\nIndividuals lost the importance which had formerly been ascribed to them,\r\nand the sojourn of strangers in Switzerland again became freer. The press\r\noccasioned more prolonged discussions at the diets and in several of the\r\ncouncils; but in the midst of these it obtained more and more freedom,\r\nand in some districts shook off all its former restrictions.\r\n\r\nDuring these years an interest in church affairs diffused itself amongst\r\nlaymen, as well as amongst theologians by profession. In the educated\r\nclasses religious indifferentism became less frequent; while the genuine\r\nspirit of tolerance made progress. This tendency, like every other widely\r\nextended mental movement, had its questionable as well as its pleasing\r\nfeatures. Shocking ebullitions of fanaticism are reported to have taken\r\nplace in Zurich, Bern, and other cantons. A footing was gained in\r\nFribourg and the Valais by the revived order of Jesuits; and the friends\r\nof human improvement could not regard without anxiety their influence in\r\necclesiastical matters and in education.[b]\r\n\r\n\r\nREACTION AND REFORM; EFFECTS OF THE REVOLUTION OF JULY\r\n\r\nThe reaction making itself manifest throughout Europe in the third decade\r\nof the nineteenth century appeared also in the individual cantons of\r\nSwitzerland and in its general government. The same disparity between\r\nthe rights of the nobility and those of the people which existed in\r\nnorthern Germany was to be found here. As we have seen, the cantons for\r\nthe most part had an aristocratic government in which a few favoured\r\nfamilies, the patricians, had so decided a preponderance that there was\r\nhardly a shadow of representation of the people. As at an earlier period\r\nin other countries there had been a distinction between _Stadt_ and\r\n_Amt_ (city and subject land), so at this time in Switzerland the same\r\ndistinction was still made between _Stadt_ and _Landschaft_ (city and\r\nrural district). The citizens belonging to the latter were permitted to\r\nsend but a few members to the “great council” of a canton.\r\n\r\nWith such privileges in the hands of the patrician families the\r\nadministration of the state was as bad as possible. Offices were\r\napportioned more according to birth than merit, the finances were\r\nnot always managed in the interests of the state. The evils of the\r\nadministration of justice had become proverbial. Federal laws for the\r\nregulation of domestic intercourse and commerce were not thought of. The\r\ndiet which met at one of the three leading places (_Vororte_)--Bern,\r\nZurich, and Lucerne--did not fall behind the German diet in reactionary\r\nsentiment, adhered closely to the system of Metternich and sent its men\r\nas mercenaries to France and Naples that it might provide appointments as\r\nofficers for the young patricians.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [1830-1832 A.D.]]\r\n\r\nThe younger generation, such as was growing up at the universities and\r\nelsewhere, would not content itself with such republics. Everywhere\r\nthe opposition of the liberals was becoming active against the rule of\r\nthe oligarchies. Since the uprisings in northern Germany, especially,\r\nthe demand for constitutional reforms became still more general.\r\nSocieties were formed and the liberal press did not tire in proclaiming\r\nthe principles of the new era; political equality, abolition of all\r\nprivileges, equal representation for all the citizens of a canton,\r\nfreedom of the press, etc. Bern, at that time the chief place (_Vorort_,\r\ncapital), whose government was the most aristocratic of all, September\r\n22nd, 1830, sent a circular letter to the governments of the cantons\r\nurging them to proceed against the press and to hold fast to the old\r\nconstitutions. This only fanned the flame. In the months of October and\r\nNovember assemblies of the notables and of the people were held in almost\r\nall the cantons, the principles of new constitutions were determined\r\nupon, and in a few weeks the governments were forced to accept them.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLACE DE LA PALUD, LAUSANNE]\r\n\r\nAlready before the revolution of July, in May, 1830, the\r\noligarchal-ultramontane government in Ticino was overthrown and a\r\ndifferent one erected on a democratic basis. The new constitution was\r\naccepted by the people in March, 1831. Events took a similar course\r\nin Zurich, where it was chiefly a matter of the relation of the rural\r\ndistricts (_Landschaft_) to the too powerful city; in Aargau, St. Gall,\r\nLucerne, Solothurn, Fribourg--where the hierarchical aristocracy,\r\nsupported by the Jesuits and congregationalists (_Congregisten_) who\r\nhad been driven out of France, mustered out soldiers but was overthrown\r\ntogether with everything belonging to it; in Vaud--where, acting with\r\nthe hot-bloodedness of Frenchmen, the people called out to the great\r\ncouncillors (_Gross-räthe_) of Lausanne, “Down with the tyrants!” and\r\nestablished a radical constitution; in Schaffhausen and in Bern--where\r\nthe deposed government for a time had the mad plan to maintain itself\r\nby help of the discharged Swiss soldiers of Charles X; in Bâle--where\r\nbloody encounters twice occurred, and where for the adjustment of the\r\nquarrel federal troops had to take station, the great council of the city\r\nconsented rather to a separation from the rural districts than conform to\r\ntheir demands. Thus there were formed here in 1832 the two half-cantons,\r\nBâle (city) and rural Bâle (with its government at Siestal). Similar\r\ndesires for separation also showed themselves in Schwyz and Valais, but\r\nthey were laid aside after embittered conflicts. On the other hand, the\r\nold constitution remained in force in Uri, Unterwalden, Zug, Geneva,\r\nGlarus, the Grisons, and Appenzell. In Neuchâtel the liberal party\r\nwould no longer recognise the king of Prussia as the sovereign, but was\r\nsuppressed in 1831 by the energy of the Prussian general Von Pfuel; and\r\nthe movement ended in a victory for the existing government.\r\n\r\n\r\nSIEBENER KONKORDAT; DISPUTES OVER ASYLUM AND RELIGION\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [1832-1845 A.D.]]\r\n\r\nThe party which in 1831 had secured a more liberal form of government\r\nin a majority of the cantons strove also to achieve reforms in the\r\nfederal constitution. At the diet of 1832 it obtained the appointment\r\nof a commission which was to revise the federal statutes and present\r\nits conclusions to an extraordinary session of the diet of 1833. The\r\nliberal cantons, Bern, Aargau, Thurgau, St. Gall, Solothurn, Zurich, and\r\nLucerne, concluded the agreement of the Seven (_Siebener Konkordat_) for\r\nthe preservation and attainment of popular sovereignty. On the other hand\r\nthe conservative party, Uri, Schwyz, Unterwalden, Valais, Neuchâtel, and\r\nthe city of Bâle, united in the league of Sarnen (_Sarner-Bund_). In\r\nconjunction with the neutral party these succeeded in 1833 in balking\r\nfederal revision. As a result their hopes and demands increased. Armed\r\nbands from Schwyz and the city of Bâle, July 30th, 1833, entered Outer\r\nSchwyz and rural Bâle to compel the submission of these seceding\r\ndistricts. The consequence was that Schwyz and Bâle city were occupied\r\nby federal troops and the league of Sarnen was declared annulled. The\r\nseparation of Bâle into two independent cantons was recognised and the\r\nreunion of Schwyz was declared--this, however, with complete equality of\r\nrights.\r\n\r\nThe gathering of many fugitives from Germany, Poland, and Italy, who\r\nfound an asylum in republican Switzerland but who at times abused\r\nhospitality, brought on complications with foreign powers. The most\r\nactive among these revolutionists was Giuseppe Mazzini of Genoa, who in\r\nspite of total lack of any promise of success was continually setting on\r\nfoot new attempts at insurrection, to keep his Italian fellow countrymen\r\nin practice. “Young Italy” which he founded at that time caused an inroad\r\nof about four hundred men under General Romarino into Savoy in order from\r\nthis point to revolutionise Piedmont and the rest of Italy. After the\r\noccupation of several villages the undertaking foundered because of the\r\nindifference of the people. From this time on Switzerland in the eyes of\r\nthe outside world appeared as the hearth of radicalism, especially as\r\nMazzini wished to extend his activity to the whole of Europe and for the\r\nrepublicanisation of this continent founded “Young Europe.” Now it rained\r\ndiplomatic notes. The neighbouring powers complained of the abuse of the\r\nright of asylum and held out the prospect of the most hostile measures,\r\nif Switzerland would not expel the participants of the Italian raid\r\nand keep a better watch over the rest. Louis Philippe went farthest in\r\nseverity toward Switzerland and even threatened her with war if she would\r\nnot expell Louis Napoleon, who had returned from America, and was living\r\nin Arenenberg as a citizen of Thurgau. The latter left Switzerland for\r\nEngland of his own accord.\r\n\r\nEven more important were the consequences of the religious conflicts. The\r\ncalling of Doctor Strauss from Würtemberg to the University at Zurich\r\nin 1839 roused the rural population to arms and caused the fall of the\r\nliberal government at Zurich; this did not again secure supremacy till\r\n1845. More significant was the question of the convents. In a conference\r\nat Baden in 1834 seven cantons had determined upon the subjection of the\r\nchurch to the authority of the state and the employment of the convents\r\nfor purposes of general usefulness. Most violent was the quarrel over\r\nthis matter in the canton Aargau, whose radical government finally, in\r\n1841, closed all the convents, among others the wealthy one of Muri,\r\nand took possession of the property for “purpose of instruction and\r\nbenevolence.” Among the bigoted Catholics there was great excitement over\r\nthis. It led to a victory of the ultramontane party in Lucerne and Valais\r\nin 1844. This party called the Jesuits to Lucerne to take charge of the\r\ninstruction of youth.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [1845-1847 A.D.]]\r\n\r\nIn this affair the wealthy farmer Joseph Leu and Sigwart Müller\r\nshowed themselves especially active. The Jesuits had also established\r\nthemselves in Fribourg and Schwyz. To expel them from Switzerland was\r\nthe aim of all the liberal cantons. The expedition of the free lances\r\n(_Freischaren_) of 1845 under the leadership of Ochsenbein of Bern met\r\nwith failure. The government of Lucerne, still more embittered by the\r\nmurder of Leu, assumed a terrorising attitude, demanded the punishment\r\nof the free lances, and restoration of the convents of the Aargau; and\r\nwhen no attention was paid to these demands concluded with Schwyz, Uri,\r\nUnterwalden, Zug, Fribourg, and Valais a separate league (_Sonderbund_)\r\nfor mutual protection against external and internal enemies. This league\r\nwithin a league was not to be endured; and, since the liberal cantons\r\nwere in the majority, they decided at the diet in Bern, in July, 1847,\r\nupon the dissolution of the Sonderbund, as being contrary to the Pact of\r\nFederation (_Bundesvertrag_) and upon the expulsion of the Jesuits. As\r\nthe fanatics of Lucerne failed to obey the diet, orders were given for\r\nfederal action against the cantons of the Sonderbund. The federal army\r\nwas mustered in and the experienced general Dufour of Geneva was placed\r\nat its head.[c]\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SONDERBUND WAR (1847 A.D.)\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [1847 A.D.]]\r\n\r\nEurope had followed with an attentive eye the events we have just\r\nrelated. Peoples were preoccupied with them, courts saw in them a source\r\nof serious anxiety. All, taking the Vienna congress as their point of\r\nview, desired a federative, neutral, and peaceable Switzerland. From this\r\npoint of view the cause of the Sonderbund seemed to them to have justice\r\non its side. But everywhere, owing to diversified interests, the language\r\ndiffered. “A fine country and a good people,” said King Louis Philippe,\r\n“but it is in a bad way. Let us keep from interfering. To hinder others\r\nso doing is to render them a great service.” Guizot nevertheless proposed\r\nto occupy himself in Swiss affairs in a conference to be held at Paris\r\nor in London, but he was unsuccessful. Once Austrian troops on the one\r\nhand, French on the other, drew near Switzerland, but they were speedily\r\nrecalled to their cantonments. Metternich would willingly have taken the\r\nlead, had he not known that France could not leave Austria to interfere\r\nalone. Thenceforth, of the two powers, one contented itself with secretly\r\naiding the Sonderbund by relays of arms and money, the other with\r\nlavishing encouragements on the seven cantons through its ambassador.\r\n\r\nPrussia hesitated, recommending Neuchâtel prudence. Czar Nicholas could\r\nnot understand an intervention unless the powers had sixty thousand men\r\nbehind them. Great Britain would not interfere at all. Under the ministry\r\nof Lord Palmerston, a young statesman named Peel, son of the illustrious\r\nminister of that name, joined the Bear Club at Bern where radicals met.\r\nAt Rome, the French ambassador, Rossi, an ancient deputy of the Geneva\r\ndiet, was charged to solicit Pius IX to recall the Jesuits from Lucerne.\r\nIt was thought both in London and Paris that the best means of restoring\r\npeace to Switzerland was to take from the radicals their principal\r\ngrievance and their flag. The holy father contented himself with letting\r\nthe Swiss know that he would remain passive in the strife (_passive se\r\nhabere decrevit_).\r\n\r\nSwitzerland, under these circumstances, was persuaded that the moment had\r\ncome frankly to declare to Europe her intention of being sole interpreter\r\nof her Pact of Alliance; to have done with the questions that agitated\r\nher; and to constitute herself on the basis of an enlarged and equitable\r\ndemocracy, which would soon see her the first on the road towards which\r\nall European peoples were proceeding. She knew the states which lavished\r\nadvice on her to be torn by a revolutionary spirit and incapable of\r\nuniting against her in a common resolution. It was under the influence of\r\nthis thought that Ochsenbein opened the confederation diet on the 5th of\r\nJuly, 1847.\r\n\r\nAlthough only the son of a hotel keeper, without instruction in the\r\nclassics, but gifted with prompt and pleasing intelligence, he presented\r\nhimself unembarrassed before an assembly wherein the heads of the two\r\nparties dividing Switzerland were sitting, and at which the majority\r\nof ministers from foreign powers assisted. Frankness characterised his\r\ndiscourse. Foreseeing a European crisis--“Our modern world,” said he,\r\n“rests on worm-eaten columns, on institutions that have for support only\r\nthe powers of habit and interests, a construction that the slightest\r\nstorm will make a ruin. Well, this storm approaches; the colossus is\r\nquite aware of it. He sleeps a dangerous sleep.” Descending from these\r\nheights to questions of the moment, the president of the diet proclaimed\r\nthe right of the majority, whom Switzerland had always recognised. When\r\nthis majority had been declared, he courteously invited all the cantons\r\nto join with it. Callame, a Neuchâtel deputy, exposed in language firm\r\nand untouched by passion the gravity of events that had given place\r\nto a separate alliance, and demanded that they should leave those who\r\nhad concluded it the time to convince themselves that it was no longer\r\nnecessary.\r\n\r\nIn reality, the vote of the majority meant a declaration of war. The\r\ndiet adjourned so as to give the parties time either to unite or to\r\nfinish their preparations for hostilities. It reassembled on the 18th\r\nof October. Two delegates, envoys of peace, were sent from each of the\r\nSonderbund cantons, but they met with scant welcome: one-half wanted war.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Colonel Dufour is Made Commander of the Army_\r\n\r\nOn the 29th of October the deputies from the seven cantons left Bern,\r\nand on the 4th of November it was decided that the decree ordering the\r\ndissolution of their alliance should be executed by arms. The diet put\r\non foot fifty thousand men, and entrusted the command, with the rank\r\nof general, to Colonel Dufour, of Geneva. No name in the army was more\r\nrespected, none had more weight. Dufour did not belong to either side. In\r\nsympathy he was conservative, but was none the less a man of progress.\r\nHe had been in the wars and published writings on military science,\r\nfruits of a long and wide experience. No chief knew as he did the canton\r\nmilitia, over whose manœuvres he had for a number of years presided\r\nin the camp at Thun, as chief instructor of the engineering corps. To\r\nthese warlike qualities he united the virtues of a man of peace. He was\r\noccupied in the elaboration, on a plan he had conceived, of the fine\r\nmap of Switzerland which bears his name, when he was called to quit the\r\npursuits of the student for the field of battle. He comprehended the\r\ndanger to his country. He clearly perceived his duty, and he thought only\r\nof accomplishing it.\r\n\r\nIn accepting the first command he made what he considered necessary\r\nstipulations, demanding a sufficient number of troops and absolute\r\npower. All this he obtained, though not without some resistance. He was\r\ngiven 100,000 men and 260 field pieces. This army he distributed into\r\nseven divisions. In the choice of superior officers, he exacted that he\r\nalone should judge of their capacity without any regard to political\r\nopinion; this was the way both to get excellent officers and to prepare\r\nfor what he considered to be his duty--the quieting of hatreds after\r\nthe struggle. In a short time there was no longer question of politics\r\nin the army. Addressing once his heads of divisions, “I shall never\r\ndepart,” he said, “from the laws of moderation and humanity. A stranger\r\nto political agitation and faithful to my military duties, I shall try\r\nto establish order and discipline in the federal troops, to make public\r\nand private property respected, to protect the Catholic religion in her\r\nministers, her temples, and her religious establishments--in a word,\r\nto do everything to soften the inevitable evils of war. If violence be\r\nused, let it not come from us. After fighting, spare the vanquished;\r\nhowever strong one may be, relieve the despair of the enemy: then we can\r\ncongratulate ourselves after the fight on never having forgotten that it\r\nwas between confederates.”\r\n\r\nThese instructions being made known, the general resolved to trust\r\nnothing to chance, and to make no offensive movement unless sure of\r\nthe superiority of his forces; this he recognised as the surest way\r\ntowards a speedy ending with the least bloodshed. Soon the confidence he\r\ninspired began to show itself. The city of Bâle, long undecided, sent\r\nhim excellent artillery. Neuchâtel and Appenzell alone continued to take\r\nno part in the war. The promptitude with which the army got under arms,\r\nwell ordered, well clothed, and well equipped, astonished foreigners.\r\nThe redivision of troops was necessitated by the situation. The country\r\noccupied by the Sonderbund formed three distinct masses--Fribourg, the\r\noriginal cantons, and Valais. Dufour proposed to attack them separately,\r\nand to begin with Fribourg.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Preparations of the Sonderbund_\r\n\r\nThe powers held exaggerated ideas of the Sonderbund forces. It could\r\nhardly put on foot more than thirty thousand regular troops. The\r\n_Landsturm_, it is true, meant a more considerable number of men, but\r\nnot having received sufficient organisation could not be compared to\r\nthe excellent reserves of the large cantons, and did not give the help\r\nexpected of them. Far from one another, the separatist states could\r\nonly with difficulty lend one another aid. The original cantons tried\r\nnevertheless to keep their ways open by means of boldness in offensive\r\nactions. Even before the diet began its campaign, the men of Uri seized\r\nthe St. Gotthard passes (November 3rd); threw themselves across the\r\nLevantina, surprised three thousand Ticinese encamped at Airolo, and\r\ndrove them as far as the Moesa bridge. But arrived at this point, they\r\nfound themselves face to face with Grisons and Ticino militia, superior\r\nto them in number, who stopped their progress. The expedition had no\r\nother result than that of holding back two thousand excellent soldiers\r\nfrom the places where decisive blows were to be struck. Another attempt,\r\nmade from Lucerne, to penetrate into Catholic Aargau and to free\r\nFribourg, by means of a diversion, had no better success.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Capitulations of Fribourg and Lucerne End the Sonderbund_\r\n\r\nWithout taking much account of these movements, Dufour occupied himself\r\nonly in concentrating his forces so as to surround the Sonderbund states,\r\non all their accessible frontiers. His provisions were assured, his\r\nhospital organised. Immediately upon the rupture being announced, Colonel\r\nOchsenbein, who presided over the diet, left office to put himself\r\nentirely at the disposition of the general-in-chief. The general placed\r\nhim at the head of the Bernese reserves, which composed his seventh\r\ndivision and which he assimilated with the active troops. He stationed\r\nthem first on the Lucerne frontier, and when he arranged to draw near\r\nFribourg, he called Ochsenbein to advance towards that capital, in\r\norder to make the enemy think he would attack from the eastern side.\r\nHowever, twenty thousand men and fifty-four artillery pieces, under\r\ncolonels Rilliet, Burkhard, and Donatz, advanced from the north and west\r\nby different routes, and kept their movements secret that they might\r\narrive on the same day at the gate of Fribourg. On the 13th the town\r\nwas surrounded. An experienced leader, Colonel Maillardoz, had raised\r\ndefences all round, and they had prepared to attack these exterior\r\nforts when the Fribourg government, recognising the impossibility of\r\nresistance, gave up the town, dismissed the troops, and renounced the\r\nSonderbund. The taking of Fribourg would not have cost the federal army a\r\nsingle man if through a mistake a Vaudois troop had not rushed under fire\r\nfrom the Bertigny redoubt, which resulted in seven killed and a large\r\nnumber wounded.\r\n\r\nAs soon as Fribourg had capitulated the general confided to Colonel\r\nRilliet the care of occupying the military cantonments and watching the\r\nentrance of Valais. He himself hastened to Aarau, to prepare for the\r\ninvestment of Lucerne. Two rivers, the Emme and the Reuss, protected\r\nthis town. The bridges on these rivers had been broken or fortified.\r\nThe ground on which it was foreseen that the most serious engagements\r\nwould be delivered was the labyrinth which stretches from the Reuss to\r\nthe Lake of Zug; bristling with wooded hills, where passage had been\r\nstopped by barricades and mines had been laid in the defiles. It was\r\nnecessary to attack these strong positions, because they served as a\r\nlink between Schwyz and Lucerne, and success on this point was decisive,\r\nwhilst elsewhere it was not so. The leader whom the five cantons had\r\nput in charge of their militia, Ulrich de Salis-Soglio, understood\r\nthis, and went to these places. The forces he could dispose of were\r\nsome twenty thousand regulars and a similar body of the _Landsturm_.\r\nSalis had learned warfare in fighting Napoleon. A sincere Protestant,\r\nhe had nevertheless devoted himself to a cause which had his political\r\nsympathies, but of which he despaired.\r\n\r\nA resolution being taken to force his entrenchments, Dufour set five\r\ndivisions of his army on the march from the various points they occupied,\r\ngiving them Lucerne as object. Ochsenbein’s reserves went down the Emme\r\nvalley, overcoming a lively resistance. The Burkhard and Donatz divisions\r\napproached the Emme and the Reuss between the bridges of Wolhusen and\r\nGislikon, at the same time that colonels Ziegler and Gmur at the head of\r\nsome odd thousands of men attacked Salis in his intrenched camps. Ziegler\r\nmastered the Gislikon bridge and the Honau defiles. Gmur, after having\r\nreceived on his march the submission of Zug, scaled the heights of Meyers\r\nKappel. Everything made for success. Victory was hotly disputed, but the\r\nSchwyzers were in the end thrown back towards Immensee, whence they fell\r\nback on Art and Goldau. Troops from the other cantons turned to Lucerne.\r\nThe separation of Schwyz with its allies was accomplished. On every hand\r\nthe federal troops marched simultaneously on that capital. The gates were\r\nopened to them by a convention, and on the 24th of November Dufour made\r\nhis entry. On the following days the Waldstätte and the Valais made their\r\nsubmission. Twenty-five days after the decree of execution the task of\r\nthe army was complete--the Sonderbund no longer existed.[d]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [1848-1874 A.D.]]\r\n\r\nThe diet now debated the draft constitution drawn up by Kern of Thurgau\r\nand Druey of Vaud, which in the summer of 1848 was accepted by fifteen\r\nand a half cantons, the minority consisting of the three forest cantons,\r\nValais, Zug, Ticino, and Appenzell (Tuner Rhodes), and it was proclaimed\r\non September 12th.\r\n\r\nFrom 1848 onwards the cantons continually revised their constitutions,\r\nalways in a democratic sense, though after the Sonderbund War Schwyz and\r\nZug abolished their Landsgemeinde. The chief point was the introduction\r\nof the _referendum_, by which laws made by the cantonal legislature may\r\n(facultative referendum) or must (obligatory referendum) be submitted\r\nto the people for their approval; and this has obtained such general\r\nacceptance that Fribourg alone does not possess the referendum in\r\neither of its two forms, Ticino having accepted it in its optional\r\nform in 1883. It was therefore only natural that attempts should be\r\nmade to revise the federal constitution of 1848 in a democratic and\r\ncentralising sense, for it had been provided that the federal assembly,\r\non its own initiative or on the written request of fifty thousand Swiss\r\nelectors, could submit the question of revision to a popular vote. In\r\n1866 the restriction of certain rights to Christians only was swept\r\naway; but the attempt at final revision in 1872 was defeated by a small\r\nmajority, owing to the efforts of the anti-centralising party. Finally,\r\nhowever, another draft was better liked, and on April 19th, 1874, the\r\nnew constitution was accepted by the people. This constitution is that\r\nnow in force, and is simply an improved edition of that of 1848. The\r\nfederal tribunal (now of nine members only) was fixed (by federal law)\r\nat Lausanne, and its jurisdiction enlarged, especially in constitutional\r\ndisputes between cantons and the federal authorities, though jurisdiction\r\nin administrative matters (_e.g._, educational, religious, election,\r\ncommercial) is given to the federal council--a division of functions\r\nwhich is very anomalous, and does not work well.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A SWISS FINIAL]\r\n\r\nA system of free elementary education was set up, and many regulations\r\nwere made on ecclesiastical matters. A man settling in another canton\r\nwas, after a residence of three months, only, given all cantonal and\r\ncommunal rights, save a share in the common property (an arrangement\r\nwhich as far as possible kept up the old principle that the “commune”\r\nis the true unit out of which cantons and the confederation are built),\r\nand the membership of the “commune” carries with it cantonal and federal\r\nrights. The referendum was introduced in its “facultative” form--_i.e._,\r\nall federal laws must be submitted to popular vote on the demand of\r\nthirty thousand Swiss electors or of eight cantons. If the revision\r\nof the federal constitution is demanded by one of the two houses of\r\nthe federal assembly or by fifty thousand Swiss citizens, the question\r\nof revision must be submitted to a popular vote, as also the draft of\r\nthe revised constitution--these provisions, contained already in the\r\nconstitution of 1848, forming a species of “obligatory referendum.” It\r\nwas supposed that this plan would lead to radical and sweeping changes,\r\nbut as a matter of fact there have been (1874-1886) about one hundred\r\nand seven federal laws and resolutions passed by the assembly, of which\r\nnineteen were by the referendum submitted to popular vote, thirteen being\r\nrejected, while six only were accepted--the rest becoming law, as no\r\nreferendum was demanded. There has been a very steady opposition to all\r\nschemes aiming at increased centralisation. By the constitutions of 1848\r\nand 1874 Switzerland has ceased to be a mere union of independent states\r\njoined by a treaty, and has become a single state with a well-organized\r\ncentral government.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [1874-1887 A.D.]]\r\n\r\nThis new constitution inclined rather to the Act of Mediation than to\r\nthe system which prevailed before 1798. A status of “Swiss citizenship”\r\nwas set up, closely joined to cantonal citizenship: a man settling in\r\na canton not being his birthplace got cantonal citizenship after two\r\nyears, but was excluded from all local rights in the “commune” where\r\nhe might reside. A federal or central government was set up, to which\r\nthe cantons gave up a certain part of their sovereign rights, retaining\r\nthe rest. The federal legislature (or assembly) was made up of two\r\nhouses--the council of states (_Stände Rat_), composed of two deputies\r\nfrom each canton, whether small or great (forty-four in all), and the\r\nnational council (_National Rat_), made up of deputies (now 145 in\r\nnumber) elected for three years, in the proportion of one for every\r\ntwenty thousand souls or fraction over ten thousand, the electors being\r\nall Swiss citizens. The federal council or executive (_Bundesrat_)\r\nconsisted of seven members elected by the federal assembly; they are\r\njointly responsible for all business, though for the sake of convenience\r\nthere are various departments, and their chairman is called the president\r\nof the confederation. The federal judiciary (_Bundesgericht_) is made\r\nup of eleven members elected by the federal assembly for three years;\r\nits jurisdiction is chiefly confined to civil cases, in which the\r\nconfederation is a party (if a canton, the federal council may refer\r\nthe case to the federal tribunal), but takes in also great political\r\ncrimes--all constitutional questions, however, being reserved for the\r\nfederal assembly. A federal university and a polytechnic school were to\r\nbe founded; the latter only has as yet been set up (1887) and is fixed at\r\nZurich. All military capitulations were forbidden in the future. Every\r\ncanton must treat Swiss citizens who belong to one of the Christian\r\nconfessions like their own citizens, for the right of free settlement\r\nis given to all such, though they acquired no rights in the “commune.”\r\nAll Christians were guaranteed the exercise of their religion, but the\r\nJesuits and similar religious orders were not to be received in any\r\ncanton. German, French, and Italian were recognised as national languages.\r\n\r\nThe constitution as a whole marked a great step forward; though very\r\nmany rights were still reserved to the cantons, yet there was a fully\r\norganised central government. Almost the first act of the federal\r\nassembly was to exercise the power given them of determining the home of\r\nthe federal authorities, and on November 28th, 1848, Bern was chosen,\r\nthough Zurich still ranks as the first canton in the confederation. By\r\nthis early settlement of disputes Switzerland was protected from the\r\ngeneral revolutionary movement of 1848.\r\n\r\nThe federal constitution of 1848 set up a permanent federal executive,\r\nlegislature, and tribunal, each and all quite distinct from and\r\nindependent of any cantonal government. This system was a modified\r\nrevival of the state of things that had prevailed from 1798 to 1803,\r\nand was an imitation of the political changes that had taken place\r\nin the cantonal constitutions after 1830. Both were victories of the\r\ncentralist or radical party, and it was therefore but natural that\r\nthis party should be called upon to undertake the federal government\r\nunder the new constitution, a supremacy that it has kept ever since. To\r\nthe centralists the council of states (two members from each canton,\r\nhowever large or small) has always been a stumbling-block, and they have\r\nmockingly nicknamed it “the fifth wheel of the coach.” In the other house\r\nof the federal legislature, the national council (one member per twenty\r\nthousand, or fraction of over ten thousand of the entire population), the\r\nradicals have always since its creation in 1848 had a majority. Hence,\r\nin the congress formed by both houses sitting together, the radicals\r\nhave had it all their own way. This is particularly important as regards\r\nthe election of the seven members of the federal executive which is made\r\nby such a congress. Now the federal executive (federal council) is in\r\nno sense a cabinet--_i.e._, a committee of the party in the majority in\r\nthe legislature for the time being. In the Swiss federal constitution\r\nthe cabinet has no place at all. Each member of the federal executive\r\nis elected by a separate ballot, and holds office for the fixed term of\r\nthree years, during which he cannot be turned out of office, while as\r\nyet but a single instance has occurred of the rejection of a federal\r\ncouncillor who offered himself for re-election.\r\n\r\nFurther, none of the members of the federal executive can hold a seat\r\nin either house of the federal legislature, though they may appear and\r\nspeak (but not vote) in either, while the federal council as such has\r\nnot necessarily any common policy, and never expresses its views on the\r\ngeneral situation (though it does as regards particular legislative and\r\nadministrative measures) in anything resembling the “speech from the\r\nthrone” in England. Thus it seems clear that the federal executive was\r\nintended by the federal constitution of 1848 (and in this respect that of\r\n1874 made no change) to be a standing committee of the legislature as a\r\nwhole, but not of a single party in the legislature, or a “cabinet,” even\r\nthough it had the majority. Yet this rule of a single political party is\r\njust what has taken place. Between 1848 and the end of 1899, thirty-six\r\nfederal councillors were elected (twenty-three from German-speaking,\r\neleven from French-speaking, and two from Italian-speaking Switzerland,\r\nthe canton of Vaud heading the list with seven). Now of these thirty-six\r\ntwo only were not radicals, _viz._ M. Ceresole (1870-75) of Vaud,\r\nwho was a Protestant liberal-conservative, and Herr Zemp (elected in\r\n1891), a Romanist conservative; yet the conservative minority is a\r\nlarge one, while the Romanists form about two-fifths of the population\r\nof Switzerland. But, despite this predominance of a single party in\r\nthe federal council, no true cabinet system has come into existence in\r\nSwitzerland, as members of the council do not resign even when their\r\npersonal policy is condemned by a popular vote, so that the resignation\r\nof Herr Welti (a member of the federal council from 1866 to 1891), in\r\nconsequence of the rejection by the people of his railway policy, caused\r\nthe greatest amazement and consternation in Switzerland.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [1891-1900 A.D.]]\r\n\r\nThe chief political parties in the federal legislature are the right,\r\nor conservatives (whether Romanists or Protestants), the centre (now\r\noften called “liberals,” but rather answering to the whigs of English\r\npolitical language), the left (or radicals), and the extreme left (or\r\nthe socialists). In the council of states there is always a federalist\r\nmajority, since in this house the smaller cantons are on an equality\r\nwith the greater ones, each indifferently having two members. But in the\r\nnational council (147 elected members) there has always been a radical\r\nmajority over all other parties, the numbers of the various parties after\r\nthe triennial elections of 1899 being roughly as follows: radicals, 86;\r\nsocialists, 9; Centre, 19; and the Right, 33. The socialists long worked\r\nunder the wing of the radicals, but now in every canton (save Geneva)\r\nthe two parties have quarrelled, the socialist vote having largely\r\nincreased. In the country the anti-radical opposition is made up of\r\nthe conservatives, who are strongest in the Romanist, and especially\r\nthe forest cantons, and of the “federalists” of French-speaking\r\nSwitzerland. There is no doubt that the people are really anti-radical,\r\nthough occasionally led away by the experiments made recently in the\r\ndomain of state socialism: they elect, indeed, a radical majority, but\r\nvery frequently reject the bills laid before them by their elected\r\nrepresentatives.\r\n\r\nFrom 1885 onwards Switzerland had some troubles with foreign powers owing\r\nto her defence of the right of asylum for fugitive German socialists,\r\ndespite the threats of Prince Bismarck, who maintained a secret police\r\nin Switzerland, one member of which, Wohlgemuth, was expelled in 1889,\r\nto the prince’s huge but useless indignation. From about 1890, as the\r\nabove troubles within and without gradually subsided, the agitation in\r\nthe country against the centralising policy of the radicals became more\r\nand more strongly marked. By the united exertions of all the opposition\r\nparties, and against the steady resistance of the radicals, an amendment\r\nwas introduced in 1891 into the federal constitution, by which fifty\r\nthousand Swiss citizens can by the “initiative” compel the federal\r\nlegislature and executive to take into consideration some point in the\r\nfederal constitution which, in the opinion of the petitioners, requires\r\nreform, and to prepare a bill dealing with it which must be submitted to\r\na popular vote. Great hopes and fears were entertained at the time as to\r\nthe working of this new institution, but both have been falsified, for\r\nthe initiative has as yet only succeeded in inserting (in 1893) in the\r\nfederal constitution a provision by which the Jewish method of killing\r\nanimals is forbidden. On the other hand, it has failed (in 1894) to\r\nsecure the adoption of a socialist scheme by which the state was bound to\r\nprovide work for every able-bodied man in the country, and (also in 1894)\r\nto carry a proposal to give to the cantons a bonus of two francs per\r\nhead of the population out of the rapidly growing returns of the customs\r\nduties.\r\n\r\nThe great rise in the productiveness of these duties has tempted the\r\nSwiss people of late years to embark on a course of state socialism,\r\nwhich may be also described as a series of measures tending to give\r\nmore and more power to the central federal government at the expense\r\nof the cantons. So, in 1890, the principle of compulsory universal\r\ninsurance against sickness and accidents was accepted by a popular vote,\r\nin 1891 likewise that of a state or federal bank, and in 1898 that of\r\nthe unification of the cantonal laws, civil and criminal, into a set\r\nof federal codes. In each case the federal government and legislature\r\nwere charged with the preparation of laws carrying out in detail these\r\ngeneral principles. But in 1897 their proposals as to a federal bank were\r\nrejected by the people, while at the beginning of 1900 the suspicion felt\r\nas to the insurance proposals elaborated by the federal authorities was\r\nso keen that a popular demand for a popular vote was signed by 115,000\r\nSwiss citizens, the legal minimum being only 30,000: they were rejected\r\n(20th of May, 1900) on a popular vote by a two to one majority. The\r\npreparation of the federal codes has progressed quietly, drafts being\r\nframed by experts and then submitted for criticism to special commissions\r\nand public opinion. But this method, though the true one to secure the\r\nevolving of order out of chaos, takes time.\r\n\r\nBy a popular vote in 1887 the federal authorities were given a monopoly\r\nof alcohol, but a proposal to deal similarly with tobacco has been very\r\nill received (though such a monopoly would undoubtedly produce a large\r\namount), and would pretty certainly be refused by the people if a popular\r\nvote were ever taken upon it. In 1895 the people declined to sanction\r\na state monopoly of matches, even though the unhealthy nature of the\r\nwork was strongly urged, and have also resolutely refused on several\r\noccasions to accept any projects for the centralising of the various\r\nbranches of military administration, etc. Among other reforms which have\r\nrecently been much discussed in Switzerland are the introduction of the\r\nobligatory referendum (which hitherto has applied only to amendments to\r\nthe federal constitution) and the initiative (now limited to piecemeal\r\nrevision of the federal constitution) to all federal laws, etc., and\r\nthe making large federal money grants to the primary schools (managed\r\nby the several cantons). The former scheme is an attempt to restrain\r\nimportant centralising measures from being presented as laws (and as\r\nsuch exempt from the compulsory referendum), and not as amendments to\r\nthe federal constitution, while the proposed school grant is part of the\r\nradical policy of buying support for unpopular measures by lavish federal\r\nsubventions, which it is hoped will outweigh the dislike of the cantons\r\nto divest themselves of any remaining fragments of their sovereignty.[e]\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBRIEF REFERENCE-LIST OF AUTHORITIES BY CHAPTERS\r\n\r\n[The letter [a] is reserved for Editorial Matter.]\r\n\r\nTranscriber’s Note: Chapters I-IV are not in this volume.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.

His history, which was admirably planned,\r\n    would have greater value for the general student if much of the\r\n    extraneous matter and all the violent Catholic partisanship\r\n    were eliminated.\r\n\r\n=Amtliche Sammlung der Akten aus der Zeit der Helvetischen Republik=, 2\r\nvols., translated by J.

A. d’, Histoire Universelle 1550-1601, Geneva, 1626,\r\n3 vols.\r\n\r\n    _Théodore Agrippa d’Aubigné_, one of the most notable\r\n    characters of the sixteenth century, was born at St. Maury,\r\n    near Pons, February 8th, 1550, of an old and noble family\r\n    which had embraced the religion of the Calvinists. The young\r\n    d’Aubigné neglected none of the educational opportunities\r\n    afforded him by his father, and at the age of six was already\r\n    able to read Latin, Greek and Hebrew. At thirteen he escaped\r\n    from the restraints of his tutor to take part in the siege\r\n    of Orléans. After his father’s death he won reputation as\r\n    a warrior under the prince of Condé, and later entered the\r\n    service of the king of Navarre. In the wars of Henry IV for\r\n    the recovery of his kingdom, d’Aubigné further distinguished\r\n    himself; but he was finally obliged by the enmity of the\r\n    queen-mother to retire from the court. During his exile he\r\n    composed the history of his time, a work remarkable for its\r\n    fearless frankness. The first two volumes were printed without\r\n    opposition; but the third was condemned on account of its\r\n    merciless criticisms. D’Aubigné, however, caused it to be\r\n    printed, thereby incurring the burning of all three volumes;\r\n    the confiscation of all his goods, and the savage persecution\r\n    of his later years, until his death at Geneva, April 29, 1630.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n=Bachtold=, J., and F. =Vetter=, Bibliotek älterer Schriftwerke\r\nder deutschen Schweiz, Frauenfeld, 1882-1884, 5 vols.--=Baker=, T.\r\nG., The Model Republic, London, 1895.--=Baebler=, J.

At seventeen\r\n    he became prior of St. Victor, a community of Benedictines near\r\n    Geneva. Revolutionist at heart, he entered into the struggle\r\n    against the duke of Savoy, who in 1519 imprisoned him and\r\n    confiscated his priory. He died in 1570, aged seventy-seven\r\n    years, after a troubled youth and a melancholy old age as\r\n    pensioner in the city where he had once been a man of mark. He\r\n    left behind him the invaluable chronicle of his time, written\r\n    half in Latin, half in the quaint French of his day, in a style\r\n    at once rude and naive, familiar and vigorous, and brimming\r\n    with picturesque imagery and lively metaphor.\r\n\r\n=Bonnechose=, E. de, Les Réformateurs avant la Réforme, Paris, 1860, 3rd\r\nedition, 2 vols.--=Brandstetter=, J.

After a preliminary course at Emmerich, his\r\n    father having refused him the means necessary to continue his\r\n    education, he made money by singing in the streets and in 1520\r\n    he recommenced his studies at Cologne, with the idea of joining\r\n    the community of the Chartreux. But his resolution and his\r\n    religion as well were changed by his association with Zwingli,\r\n    whose doctrine he embraced and whose successor he became.\r\n    In addition to his history of the Reformation and numerous\r\n    theological writings he edited the complete works of Zwingli.\r\n\r\n=Burckhardt=, Der Kirchenschatz des Münsters zu Basel, Bâle, 1867.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n=Cæsar=, J., De bello gallico.--=Casus S.

He was in 1882 one of the negotiators of\r\n    the Franco-Swiss treaty.

The lake-dwellers, the earliest\r\n    people of which traces remain in what is now Switzerland,\r\n    live in primitive huts built on piles in the shallow waters\r\n    of various lakes. They do not know the use of metal; use\r\n    stone axe-heads, fixed in stag’s horn and wood hafts, flint\r\n    arrow-heads, etc.\r\n\r\n    3000-1000 B.C. (Bronze Age.) The lakemen learn to manipulate\r\n    metal; advance in skill and mental culture; make artistically\r\n    shaped bronze spear-heads, swords, etc.\r\n\r\n    1000-100 B.C. (Iron Age.) The lakemen substitute iron\r\n    for bronze and achieve greater beauty and perfection of\r\n    workmanship. Their weapons and implements become gradually\r\n    identical with those of historic times. In their later days\r\n    they come into contact with Gauls and Romans.\r\n\r\n    107 B.C. The Helvetians, one of the chief of the tribes then\r\n    inhabiting Switzerland, led by the clan of the Tigurini and\r\n    under command of their chief Diviko, joined the Cimbri and\r\n    Teutones in a raid into southern Gaul. The allies defeat the\r\n    Romans, under the consul Lucius Cassius, at Agen, and overrun\r\n    Gaul.\r\n\r\n    102 B.C. The barbarians are defeated by the Romans under the\r\n    consul Marius near Aquæ Sextiæ and one clan of the Helvetians,\r\n    that of the Toygeni, is annihilated.\r\n\r\n    101 B.C. Another division of the invading barbarians is cut to\r\n    pieces by the forces of Marius and his colleague Catullus, near\r\n    Vercelli. The Helvetian clan of the Tigurini alone escapes.\r\n\r\n    60 B.C. The Helvetians prepare for a second migration into\r\n    Gaul. A powerful chief, Orgetorix, promises to secure free\r\n    passage through the lands of the Allobroges and Ædui. He is\r\n    accused of treason and dies, by suicide or murder.\r\n\r\n    58 B.C. The Helvetians, accompanied by the Boii and neighboring\r\n    tribes, begin the march. Julius Cæsar checks the Helvetians at\r\n    the Rhone, and destroys the Tigurini at the Arar (Saône). At\r\n    Bibracte Cæsar defeats the Helvetians. Their remnants return\r\n    home.\r\n\r\n\r\nUNDER ROMAN DOMINION\r\n\r\n    57 B.C. Cæsar’s lieutenant, Sergius Galba, subdues the\r\n    Helvetian Veragri and Seduni. Helvetia is made a Roman province.\r\n\r\n    52 B.C. The Helvetians take part in the revolt of Vercingetorix.\r\n\r\n    43 B.C. Romans settle at Noviodunum (Nyon) and in various other\r\n    parts of Helvetia.\r\n\r\n    27 B.C. Helvetia is made part of Belgica, one of the provinces\r\n    of Gaul, and comes more directly under Roman control.\r\n\r\n    15 B.C. Rhætia (the Grisons) is subjugated by armies under\r\n    Drusus and Tiberius Nero and made a Roman province.\r\n\r\n    A.D. 69 Aulus Cæcina lays waste Helvetia and massacres large\r\n    numbers of the inhabitants. Claudius Corius, a Helvetian\r\n    deputy, by his eloquence saves the people from complete\r\n    destruction. Aventicum (Avenches) becomes a Roman city of\r\n    importance. Roman civilisation makes much progress in Helvetia,\r\n    especially in the western portion. Under the Romans military\r\n    roads and fortresses are built.\r\n\r\n\r\nFROM THE GERMAN INVASIONS THROUGH THE CARLOVINGIANS\r\n\r\n    260 Hordes of Alamanni devastate Switzerland. They partially\r\n    destroy Aventicum.\r\n\r\n    300 Christianity makes some converts in Switzerland.\r\n\r\n    305 Alamanni again overrun Switzerland.\r\n\r\n    406 The Alamanni conquer eastern Switzerland.\r\n\r\n    409 The Burgundians march toward the Rhine and approach\r\n    Switzerland.\r\n\r\n    443 The Burgundians settle in western Switzerland, receiving\r\n    “Sabaudia” (Savoy) from the Romans.\r\n\r\n    496 The Franks subjugate the Alamanni, acquiring eastern\r\n    Switzerland.\r\n\r\n    493 The Goths conquer Rhætia.\r\n\r\n    500 King Gondebaud rules in Burgundy. His laws become part of\r\n    Swiss institutions.\r\n\r\n    524 The Franks, under Clodomir, capture Geneva.\r\n\r\n    534 The Franks subjugate the Burgundians, bringing western\r\n    Switzerland into their power.\r\n\r\n    536 Rhætia is given up to the Franks by the Goths.\r\n\r\n    570 The Langobardi invade southern Switzerland.\r\n\r\n    574 The Frankish king Gontran checks the incursions of the\r\n    Langobardi.\r\n\r\n    610 The Culdee monks, led by Columbanus and Gallus, spread\r\n    Christianity in Switzerland.\r\n\r\n    687 The Carlovingians begin their rule over the Franks. They\r\n    foster religious establishments in Switzerland.\r\n\r\n    768 Charlemagne ascends the Frankish throne. He gives an\r\n    impetus to religion, education, and industry in Switzerland;\r\n    founds schools and churches and increases their wealth.\r\n\r\n    774 The Franks gain possession of the Italian valleys of\r\n    Switzerland till then held by the Langobardi.\r\n\r\n    843 By the Treaty of Verdum western or Burgundian Switzerland\r\n    falls to Lothair, eastern or German Switzerland (Alamannia)\r\n    with Rhætia to Ludwig the German. Feudalism is becoming well\r\n    established in Switzerland. The church owns large estates and\r\n    the bishops are powerful. Arts and sciences progress in the\r\n    monasteries of St. Gall, Reichenau, and Pfäffers.\r\n\r\n    853 Ludwig the German founds the Fraumünster at Zurich.\r\n\r\n\r\nTIME OF BURGUNDIAN AND ALAMANNIAN RULERS\r\n\r\n    888 Rudolf I is crowned king of Upper Burgundy and begins to\r\n    rule over western Switzerland.\r\n\r\n    917 Count Burkhard of Rhætia is made duke of Alamannia\r\n    (Swabia). He rules over eastern Switzerland.\r\n\r\n    919 Burkhard I, duke of Alamannia, defeats Rudolf II of Upper\r\n    Burgundy at Winterthur.\r\n\r\n    920 Alamannia is formally incorporated with Germany. Eastern\r\n    Switzerland thus becomes a part of Germany.\r\n\r\n    922 Rudolf II of Upper Burgundy marries Burkhard’s daughter\r\n    Bertha who brings to Burgundy the upper Aargau.\r\n\r\n    930 Rudolf II acquires Arelat (Cisjurane Burgundy) as the\r\n    result of a raid into Italy with Hugo of Provence. Thus\r\n    the kingdom of Burgundy is reunited and Switzerland, as an\r\n    important part of this kingdom, attains prominence.\r\n\r\n    937 Rudolf II of Burgundy dies. Good Queen Bertha, his widow,\r\n    rules beneficently as regent for her son Conrad.\r\n\r\n    940 Conrad is placed under the guardianship of Otto I of\r\n    Germany. Beginning of German influence in western Switzerland.\r\n\r\n    950 Conrad defeats the Hungarians that invade Switzerland.\r\n\r\n    962 Queen Bertha founds a religious house at Payerne.\r\n    (Traditional.)\r\n\r\n    990 Ekkehard II of St. Gall, the most famous man of learning of\r\n    his time, dies.\r\n\r\n    992 The serfs rise against the nobles of Aargau and Thurgau.\r\n\r\n    993 Rudolf III of Burgundy. Switzerland is turned over more and\r\n    more to the clergy and the great nobles.\r\n\r\n    1016 Rudolf III abdicates in favor of Henry II of Germany.\r\n    Henry is opposed by the nobles of Burgundy in several battles\r\n    in Switzerland.\r\n\r\n    1022 The distinguished scholar Notker III of St. Gall dies.\r\n\r\n\r\nFROM THE UNION OF SWITZERLAND UNDER THE GERMAN EMPERORS TO THE FOUNDING\r\nOF THE SWISS CONFEDERATION\r\n\r\n    1032 Conrad II of Germany defeats the Burgundians at Morat and\r\n    Neuchâtel.\r\n\r\n    1033 He is crowned king of Burgundy and thus adds western\r\n    Switzerland to Germany.\r\n\r\n    1038 Burgundy, Alamannia, and Rhætia fall to Henry III. All\r\n    Switzerland is hereby reunited as part of Germany. St. Gall\r\n    is a leader in learning. The abbeys of Zurich, Rheinau, and\r\n    Einsiedeln and the bishoprics of Coire, Constance, and Bâle\r\n    attain great eminence.\r\n\r\n    1045 Henry III of Germany by assuming the crown of Lombardy\r\n    secures possession of all the territories of Switzerland not\r\n    already within his dominions (Italian Switzerland). He is\r\n    frequently at Bâle and Solothurn. He holds imperial diets at\r\n    Zurich and lavishes gifts on her religious foundations.\r\n\r\n    1057 Rudolf of Rheinfelden begins his rule as duke of Alamannia\r\n    and governor of Burgundy, thus controlling all Switzerland.\r\n\r\n    1077 Rudolf is elected king by the opponents of Henry IV.\r\n    Switzerland is drawn into the struggle between Henry IV and\r\n    Pope Gregory VII.\r\n\r\n    1080 Rudolf is slain and his army defeated at Mersburg. The\r\n    Guelf-Zähringen faction wars against Frederick of Hohenstaufen\r\n    for the possession of Alamannia. Many monasteries, castles, and\r\n    towns are destroyed in Switzerland.\r\n\r\n    1090 Berthold II of Zähringen inherits the possessions of the\r\n    Rheinfeldens in Switzerland.\r\n\r\n    1097 Berthold II surrenders his claims to the dukedom of\r\n    Alamannia. He receives as recompense the imperial bailiwick of\r\n    Zurich, and is made duke of that portion of Alamannia lying in\r\n    what is now Switzerland.\r\n\r\n    1114 The people of Schwyz resist the encroachments of the monks\r\n    of Einsiedeln. Henry V decides in favour of Einsiedeln.\r\n\r\n    1127 Conrad of Zähringen is created rector of Burgundy by the\r\n    emperor Lothair. Most of the territories comprising modern\r\n    Switzerland are now under the rule of the house of Zähringen.\r\n    This family governs benevolently throughout the century.\r\n\r\n    1140 Arnold of Brescia finds asylum at Zurich.\r\n\r\n    1144 In the quarrel of Einsiedeln and Schwyz, Conrad III\r\n    decides in favour of Einsiedeln.\r\n\r\n    1146 Bernard of Clairvaux preaches the crusade at Zurich. Many\r\n    Swiss join the crusade.\r\n\r\n    1152 The Waldstätte are placed under an interdict by the bishop\r\n    of Constance.\r\n\r\n    1173 By inheritance of the possessions of the house of Lenzburg\r\n    in Aargau and in the forest states the house of Hapsburg gains\r\n    in wealth and power.\r\n\r\n    1177 Berthold IV of Zähringen founds the free city of Fribourg.\r\n\r\n    1186 Berthold V succeeds. He develops the policy of walling in\r\n    strong cities to offset the power of the nobles. He fortifies\r\n    Burgdorf, Moudon, Yuerdon, Laupen, and Schaffhausen.\r\n\r\n    1190 Berthold V defeats the rebellious nobles at Avenches and\r\n    in the Grindelwald.\r\n\r\n    1191 Berthold V founds the city of Bern.\r\n\r\n    1209 Franciscan monks begin to enter Switzerland.\r\n\r\n    1211 Berthold V is defeated by Count Thomas of Savoy, who\r\n    seizes Moudon.\r\n\r\n    1215 Dominicans begin to enter Switzerland.\r\n\r\n    1218 Berthold V dies childless. With him the house of Zähringen\r\n    and the rectorate of Burgundy ends. Switzerland reverts to\r\n    Germany. Bern, Solothurn, Zurich, and other towns become\r\n    immediately dependent on the emperor, and gain in freedom.\r\n    Many nobles become subject to the empire alone and increase in\r\n    power. The houses of Savoy, Kyburg (inheritors of the lands of\r\n    the Zähringens), and Habsburg become most prominent. Religious\r\n    orders flourish.\r\n\r\n    1231 The people of Uri obtain their first charter from King\r\n    Henry, which nominally places them directly under the empire.\r\n\r\n    1240 The community of Schwyz is given a charter from the empire\r\n    by Frederick II. Savoy extends her dominion to include Vaud and\r\n    other portions of Southern Switzerland.\r\n\r\n    1245-1250 The people of Switzerland take sides in the struggle\r\n    between Guelfs and Ghibellines. Risings occur in the Waldstätte\r\n    against the house of Habsburg which has gained authority in\r\n    middle and eastern Switzerland. The expulsion of oppressive\r\n    bailiffs (referred to this period by modern investigators from\r\n    its former position in 1307-08).\r\n\r\n    1250 Lucerne enters into alliance with Schwyz and Obwalden.\r\n\r\n    1254 The _antiqua confederatio_, the earliest league of the\r\n    Waldstätte, is formed (uncertain date).\r\n\r\n    1255 Pierre of Savoy is acknowledged suzerain of Bern; later of\r\n    Morat and Bâle.\r\n\r\n    1264 Pierre of Savoy is acknowledged suzerain of Geneva. The\r\n    greatness of the house of Habsburg is founded through the\r\n    inheritance of the possessions of the Kyburgs.\r\n\r\n    1266 Zurich with the aid of Rudolf of Habsburg defeats Ulrich\r\n    of Regensburg. Rudolf gains in influence with several Swiss\r\n    towns.\r\n\r\n    1267 Pierre of Savoy defeats an army sent against him by Rudolf\r\n    of Habsburg at Löwenburg. Peace between Habsburg and Savoy.\r\n\r\n    1273 Rudolf of Habsburg besieges Bâle. He is chosen emperor of\r\n    Germany. Bâle submits, Rudolf inherits the possessions of his\r\n    cousins in the Waldstätte.\r\n\r\n    1275 Rudolf of Habsburg is consecrated emperor by Pope Gregory\r\n    at Lausanne.\r\n\r\n    1277 Rudolf acquires Fribourg. He now holds in Switzerland\r\n    territories equivalent to the modern cantons of Aar, Zug,\r\n    Thurgau, Bern, and Lucerne, the towns of Sursee, Sempach, and\r\n    Winterthur, the convent of Säckingen, and the wardenship of the\r\n    Waldstätte.\r\n\r\n    1288 Rudolf twice unsuccessfully besieges Bern.\r\n\r\n    1289 The Bernese suffer loss in an Austrian ambuscade at the\r\n    Schosshalde and Bern is compelled to make peace.\r\n\r\n    1291 The men of Uri, Schwyz, and Unterwalden (the three\r\n    Waldstätte) form the Everlasting League (_Ewige Bund_), for the\r\n    defence of their common rights and interests. The Waldstätte\r\n    form a temporary alliance with Zurich. In the struggle for the\r\n    imperial throne between Adolf of Nassau and Albert, duke of\r\n    Austria, the confederates with Zurich and Bâle side against\r\n    Albert. War ensues. The territories of the bishop of Constance\r\n    and the abbot of St. Gall are laid waste.\r\n\r\n    1292 The Austrians defeat the men of Zurich before Winterthur.\r\n    Zurich is forced to make peace with Albert and her alliance\r\n    with the forest states is annulled.\r\n\r\n    1294 The first Landsgemeinde of which record remains is held in\r\n    Schwyz.\r\n\r\n    1297 Adolf of Nassau as king of Germany confirms the charter of\r\n    1240 to Schwyz and the same charter to Uri.\r\n\r\n    1298 The Bernese defeat the Austrian nobles at Dornbühl.\r\n    Albert, duke of Austria, ascends the German throne and\r\n    strengthens the power of Austria in Switzerland.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FOURTEENTH CENTURY\r\n\r\n    1307 Werner Stauffacher of Schwyz, Walter Fürst of Uri, and\r\n    Arnold of the Melchthal in Unterwalden, with thirty companions\r\n    take an oath on the Rütli to free the country from oppressors.\r\n    William Tell shoots the Austrian bailiff Gessler. (These events\r\n    are now regarded as legendary.)\r\n\r\n    1308 The expulsion of the bailiffs. (This event some historians\r\n    now regard as merely traditional and refer it to the period\r\n    1245-50.) King Albert is murdered. Bern concludes a league with\r\n    Solothurn.\r\n\r\n    1309 Henry VIII confirms the charters of Schwyz and Uri, and\r\n    grants liberties to Unterwalden, placing all three under direct\r\n    imperial jurisdiction. The confederates renew their alliance\r\n    with Zurich.\r\n\r\n    1314 The men of Schwyz capture the abbey of Einsiedeln because\r\n    of a quarrel over pasture land. Frederick of Austria places the\r\n    Waldstätte under the ban of the empire. The Waldstätte conclude\r\n    alliances with Glarus, Ursern, Art, and Interlaken. Louis of\r\n    Bavaria, rival of Frederick for the German throne, declares the\r\n    ban removed. The confederates take his side in the struggle for\r\n    the throne.\r\n\r\n    1315 Duke Leopold of Austria, brother of Frederick, moves\r\n    against the Waldstätte. The Swiss vanquish the Austrians at\r\n    Morgarten. Leopold is slain. The three forest districts renew\r\n    the Everlasting League of 1291.\r\n\r\n    1316 Louis of Bavaria recognises the new league, declares the\r\n    political rights of the house of Austria forfeit in the forest\r\n    districts, and confirms their several charters.\r\n\r\n    1318 Truce with Austria. The Habsburgs surrender all\r\n    jurisdiction over the Waldstätte, but their rights merely as\r\n    landowners are recognized. Risings against Austria in western\r\n    Switzerland. Leopold besieges the free town of Solothurn, but\r\n    soon withdraws. (Traditional rescue of the Austrians at the\r\n    bridge by the men of Solothurn.)\r\n\r\n    1323 Bern and other Burgundian towns enter into an alliance\r\n    with the forest districts for protection against Austria and\r\n    the aristocracy.\r\n\r\n    1328 Lucerne revolts from Austria.\r\n\r\n    1332 Lucerne (fourth of the “old” places) joins the league.\r\n\r\n    1336 Civic revolution in Zurich places Rudolf Brun at the head\r\n    of the city government and gives power to the craft-guilds.\r\n\r\n    1339 The Bernese with men from the forest districts defeat the\r\n    nobles at Laupen.\r\n\r\n    1350 Massacre of Austrian conspirators at Zurich. The men of\r\n    Zurich destroy the castle of Rapperschwyl, Zurich thereby\r\n    incurs the enmity of Austria.\r\n\r\n    1351 Zurich (fifth of the “old” places) for protection against\r\n    Austria enters the league. First regulations as to the aid that\r\n    the confederates owe to each other, first federal rights and\r\n    establishment of the circle of confederate defence. Duke Albert\r\n    of Austria unsuccessfully besieges Zurich.\r\n\r\n    1352 Zug and Glarus (sixth and seventh of the “old” places)\r\n    enter the league. The duke of Austria renews war on Zurich. By\r\n    the terms of the peace of Brandenburg, Zug and Glarus are again\r\n    brought into subjection to Austria.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CONFEDERATION OF THE EIGHT OLD PLACES\r\n\r\n    1353 Bern (completing the eight “old” places) enters the\r\n    league, adding greatly to its strength.\r\n\r\n    1354 Zurich is besieged by the forces of Austria and the empire.\r\n\r\n    1355 Peace is declared at Regensburg (Ratisbon).\r\n\r\n    1361 Charles IV recognises the confederation of eight states\r\n    as a lawful union for the preservation of the public peace\r\n    (_Landfriedensverbindung_).\r\n\r\n    1364 Zug is freed from Austrian rule by the men of Schwyz.\r\n\r\n    1367 The Gotteshausbund (league of God’s house) is formed in\r\n    the Engadine.\r\n\r\n    1368 The Peace of Thorberg adjusts matters between Austria and\r\n    the confederates. Zug rejoins the league as a permanent member.\r\n\r\n    1370 The Parson’s Ordinance (_Pfaffenbrief_) abolishes special\r\n    exemption of the clergy and provides for the preservation of\r\n    peace among the confederates.\r\n\r\n    1375 Enguerrand de Coucy to assert claims to lands in\r\n    Aargau invades Switzerland with a horde of irregulars in\r\n    the Guglerkrieg, or English War. De Coucy is routed in the\r\n    Entlebuch and at Freibrunnen.\r\n\r\n    1382 Rudolf of Kyburg, of the Habsburg line, is defeated by\r\n    Bern and Solothurn, in the Kyburg War.\r\n\r\n    1384 Bern and Solothurn take Thun, Burgdorf, and other places\r\n    from Rudolf of Kyburg. The Kyburgs are forced to accept\r\n    citizenship in Bern.\r\n\r\n    1385 The Swiss cities join the league of the south German\r\n    towns. The men of Lucerne demolish Rotenburg, the residence of\r\n    the Austrian bailiff.\r\n\r\n    1386 The forest districts come to the aid of Lucerne against\r\n    Austria. The Swiss defeat the Austrians in spite of great odds\r\n    in the battle of Sempach (Arnold Winkelried).\r\n\r\n    1388 The men of Glarus aided by a few from Schwyz defeat the\r\n    Austrians at Näfels. Glarus is delivered from Austria.\r\n\r\n    1389 The confederates are secured in their conquests by a seven\r\n    years’ truce with Austria. Glarus permanently rejoins the\r\n    league.\r\n\r\n    1393 Schöno’s attempt to deliver Zurich to Austria fails. By\r\n    the Sempach Ordinance (_Sempacher Brief_) the confederates are\r\n    drawn closer together by provision for an army and for the\r\n    preservation of order.\r\n\r\n    1394 The truce with Austria is prolonged for twenty years. The\r\n    Swiss Confederacy is recognised and political dependence on\r\n    Habsburg is practically at an end. The country hereafter is\r\n    commonly known as _Die Schweiz_ (Switzerland).\r\n\r\n    1395 Formation of the Upper (Grey) League in the western\r\n    Grisons.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FIFTEENTH CENTURY\r\n\r\n    1402 Revolt of the people of Appenzell and St. Gall against the\r\n    abbot of St. Gall.\r\n\r\n    1403 The Appenzellers defeat the abbot’s forces at Vögelinseck.\r\n\r\n    1405 The abbot’s troops, assisted by an Austrian army, are\r\n    defeated in the battle of the Rheinthal or Stoss.\r\n\r\n    1408 The Appenzellers are beaten at Bregenz.\r\n\r\n    1411 Appenzell is placed under the protection of the Swiss\r\n    League (save Bern).\r\n\r\n    1412 The truce of the league with Austria is prolonged for\r\n    fifty years. During the first half of the century the league\r\n    increases its territory, not giving political rights, however,\r\n    to the acquired lands.\r\n\r\n    1414 The council of Constance is convened. Switzerland is\r\n    visited by great numbers of ecclesiastics and great nobles.\r\n\r\n    1415 Duke Frederick of Austria helps John XXIII escape from\r\n    Constance. The emperor Sigismund places Frederick under the\r\n    ban. By Sigismund’s order the confederates conquer the Austrian\r\n    Aargau. Bern receives the lion’s share. The first common\r\n    bailiwicks (_Freie Amter_) are established. Uprising of the\r\n    Valais against the baron von Raron, a despotic ruler.\r\n\r\n    1416 Lucerne, Uri, and Unterwalden form an alliance with Upper\r\n    Valais.\r\n\r\n    1417 Uri and Upper Valais take the Val d’Ossola from Savoy.\r\n\r\n    1422 The attempts of Uri and the confederates to acquire\r\n    territory to the south of the Alps receive a check in their\r\n    defeat by the Milanese at Arbedo.\r\n\r\n    1424 The Grey League is formally renewed.\r\n\r\n    1436 The league of the Ten Jurisdictions is formed in the\r\n    eastern Grisons. Conflicting claims over the territories left\r\n    by Frederick, count of Toggenburg, cause dissension between\r\n    Zurich and Schwyz. The other confederates take sides with\r\n    Schwyz.\r\n\r\n    1440 The men of Zurich invade Schwyz but are compelled to\r\n    retreat. Felix Hämmerlin, humanist, furthers the new learning\r\n    at Zurich.\r\n\r\n    1442 Zurich allies itself with Austria and resists federal\r\n    jurisdiction. Civil war (the Old Zurich War) breaks out.\r\n\r\n    1443 The Zurich troops are defeated at Sankt Jacob on the Sihl.\r\n    Stüssi, the burgomaster of Zurich is slain.\r\n\r\n    1444 Zurich is besieged by the confederates. Charles VII of\r\n    France sends to her aid wild bands of the Armagnacs under\r\n    command of the dauphin Louis. They slaughter the confederates,\r\n    who make a heroic defence at Sankt Jacob on the Birs before\r\n    Bâle.\r\n\r\n    1450 Peace is concluded. Zurich is forced to renounce her\r\n    alliance with Austria.\r\n\r\n    1452 The Swiss League concludes treaty of friendship with\r\n    France. A new class of allies, the associate districts\r\n    (_Zugwandte Orte_), begins to gather round the league.\r\n\r\n    1458 The league forms an alliance with Rapperschwyl. Sigismund,\r\n    duke of Austria, irritated by its loss declares war.\r\n\r\n    1460 The confederates overrun the Austrian Thurgau. This\r\n    results in the second accession of common bailiwicks. The art\r\n    of printing is established at Bâle. Founding of the University\r\n    of Bâle. Material and artistic culture flourishes.\r\n\r\n    1461 Sigismund gives up Thurgau which comes under the\r\n    protection of the confederates.\r\n\r\n    1463 The confederates renew the French treaty with Louis XI.\r\n\r\n    1467 Zurich purchases Winterthur from Sigismund. The league\r\n    makes a treaty of friendship with Philip the Good, duke of\r\n    Burgundy.\r\n\r\n    1468 The Swiss lay siege to Waldshut. Sigismund buys them off.\r\n\r\n    1469 Sigismund obtains the protection and financial aid of\r\n    Charles the Bold of Burgundy. He gives as security Alsace, the\r\n    Waldshut, and the Black Forest. The alliance of Charles with\r\n    Sigismund violates the treaty of 1467 and incenses the Swiss.\r\n    Charles the Bold commits the mortgaged lands to Peter von\r\n    Hagenbach, as vogt. His severity is complained of by the Swiss.\r\n\r\n    1470 Louis XI of France makes a treaty with the Swiss to secure\r\n    their neutrality.\r\n\r\n    1471 The three leagues of the Grisons confirm an earlier\r\n    alliance.\r\n\r\n    1473 Sigismund becomes the ally of Louis, who aims to reconcile\r\n    Sigismund and the Swiss and turn them against Charles the Bold.\r\n\r\n    1474 The confederates attempt in vain to get redress from\r\n    Charles the Bold for the wrongs done by Hagenbach to their\r\n    friends in Alsace. As the result of the efforts of Louis\r\n    XI, the Everlasting Compact (_Ewige Richtung_) is signed at\r\n    Constance. By it Sigismund renounces all Austrian claims on the\r\n    lands of the confederates and they agree to support him. The\r\n    freedom of the Swiss Confederation from the Habsburgs is now\r\n    formally established. The Swiss and Sigismund join a league of\r\n    the Alsatian and Rhine cities. Hagenbach is put to death with\r\n    the connivance of Bern. The confederates at the instance of\r\n    Sigismund declare war against Charles. Bern takes the lead in\r\n    westward aggression. Héricourt is taken by the confederates.\r\n\r\n    1475 Further successes of the Swiss. Bern captures sixty towns\r\n    in Vaud, fighting against Savoy, which has joined Charles the\r\n    Bold. Bern and Upper Valais form an alliance and the latter\r\n    prevents the passage of the Milanese troops of Savoy. The\r\n    emperor and Louis desert the confederates.\r\n\r\n    1476 Charles the Bold captures Granson and has the garrison\r\n    executed by two of their own comrades. The Swiss gain a\r\n    glorious victory in the battle of Granson and retake the\r\n    town. Rich spoils and revenge. Charles besieges Morat. In the\r\n    battle of Morat the Swiss decisively defeat the Burgundians.\r\n    By intervention of Louis XI an arrangement is made with Savoy\r\n    by which for the first time French-speaking districts become\r\n    connected with the confederation. Savoy loses Fribourg,\r\n    Granson, Morat, Orbe, Echallens, and Aigle. Bern profits most.\r\n\r\n    1477 The Swiss and the troops of René, duke of Lorraine, defeat\r\n    Charles the Bold at the battle of Nancy. The foundation of\r\n    Swiss nationality is firmly laid by these victories, and the\r\n    fame of Swiss arms is world-wide; but internal jealousies\r\n    arise. Riots in various states. The band of the Mad Life.\r\n    Zurich, Bern, Lucerne, Fribourg, and Solothurn form a separate\r\n    league and a perpetual treaty (_Burgrecht_).\r\n\r\n    1478 The men of Zurich, Lucerne, Uri, and Schwyz defeat the\r\n    Milanese at the battle of Giornico. Switzerland expands toward\r\n    the south.\r\n\r\n    1480 Fribourg and Solothurn seek admission to the league. This\r\n    demand is opposed by the rural members and supported by the\r\n    towns belonging to the separate league of the Burgrecht.\r\n\r\n    1481 The Compact of Stanz (_Stanzer Verkomnis_) prevents\r\n    disruption. Nicholas von der Fluhe aids to an understanding.\r\n    Fribourg and Solothurn (the ninth and tenth members) are\r\n    admitted to the confederation. The separate league of the towns\r\n    is dissolved. Dangerous societies are forbidden. The compact\r\n    concentrates the government of the confederation.\r\n\r\n    1489 Hans Waldmann, burgomaster of Zurich, attempts to\r\n    subordinate the peasants. He is overthrown and executed.\r\n\r\n    1490 Insurrection against the federal government in St. Gall is\r\n    put down.\r\n\r\n    1496 The Swiss refuse to obey the imperial chamber, objecting\r\n    to taxation without representation. They refuse to join the\r\n    Swabian League.\r\n\r\n    1497 The confederates conclude a perpetual league with the Grey\r\n    League of the Grisons.\r\n\r\n    1498 The confederates conclude a perpetual league with the\r\n    League of God’s House (_Gotteshausbund_) of the Grisons.\r\n\r\n    1499 The Swiss go to the support of their allies in the\r\n    Grisons against the emperor Maximilian and the Swabian\r\n    League. Successes of the Swiss at Triesen, at Bruderholz\r\n    near Bâle, at Calven, at Schwaderloo, and at Frastenz. The\r\n    Swiss Confederation by the peace of Bâle secures freedom from\r\n    German imperial regulations and rises to the rank of an allied\r\n    state of the empire, having practical independence. The Swiss\r\n    establish their rights in the Thurgau. The league of Ten\r\n    Jurisdictions in the Grisons confirms an alliance with the\r\n    Swiss League.\r\n\r\n    1500 Swiss mercenaries engaged by Louis Sforza surrender Novara\r\n    to the French rather than fight the Swiss in the French army of\r\n    Louis XII. By the help of the Swiss Milan becomes a property of\r\n    France. The practice of Swiss serving in foreign armies has now\r\n    become frequent.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SIXTEENTH CENTURY\r\n\r\n    1501 Bâle and Schaffhausen (the eleventh and twelfth members)\r\n    are admitted to the confederation.\r\n\r\n    1510 Schinner, bishop of Sitten, induces Swiss troops to aid in\r\n    the expulsion of the French from Italy.\r\n\r\n    1512 The Swiss conquer Milan and drive the French out of Italy;\r\n    declare Maximilian duke of Milan. In return the confederates\r\n    receive Ticino and the Grisons leagues get the Valtellina,\r\n    Cleves, and Bormio.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CONFEDERATION OF THIRTEEN STATES\r\n\r\n    1513 Appenzell is admitted to the confederation, thus\r\n    completing the confederation of Thirteen States. The Swiss\r\n    defeat the French at Novara.\r\n\r\n    1515 Francis I defeats the Swiss at Marignano, breaking the\r\n    Swiss power in northern Italy.\r\n\r\n    1516 The Swiss League concludes a treaty of Perpetual Peace\r\n    with France. Hans Holbein at Bâle wins great reputation as a\r\n    painter. His work marks the further advance of humanism in\r\n    Switzerland.\r\n\r\n    1519 Ulrich (Huldreich) Zwingli preaches the Reformation at\r\n    Zurich.\r\n\r\n    1521 Twelve states of the confederation (Zurich being\r\n    restrained by Zwingli) conclude an alliance with France.\r\n\r\n    1522 The diet at Lucerne forbids the clergy to preach\r\n    unauthorised doctrines.\r\n\r\n    1523 Zwingli’s teaching is sanctioned by the council at two\r\n    “disputations” at Zurich. Zurich pushes forward the work of the\r\n    Reformation, but is not supported by the other confederates.\r\n    The first ecclesiastics are publicly married.\r\n\r\n    1524 Under Zwingli’s leadership Zurich dissolves the\r\n    monasteries. The forest states prevail on the diet at Lucerne\r\n    to pronounce for the old faith. Religious riots occur in\r\n    the Thurgau. The monastery of Ittingen is burned down. The\r\n    Reformation progresses in eastern Switzerland.\r\n\r\n    1525 The mass is discontinued at Zurich. The temporal rights of\r\n    the Grossmünster are turned over to the state.

The confederation is in danger of breaking up.\r\n\r\n    1529 Lucerne, Uri, Schwyz, Unterwalden, and Zug form the\r\n    Christian Alliance (_Christliche Vereinigung_), and ally\r\n    themselves with Austria. First war of Kappel. The Austrian\r\n    alliance is annulled and religious parity for each member of\r\n    the confederation is declared by the first Peace of Kappel.\r\n\r\n    1530 Genoa with confederate aid secures freedom from Savoy.\r\n\r\n    1531 Second war of Kappel.

The\r\n    Reformation in Switzerland is considerably checked. Catholic\r\n    reaction. The league is now completely split into Catholics and\r\n    evangelicals.\r\n\r\n    1532 William Farel begins to preach the Reformation in Geneva.\r\n\r\n    1535 The Reformation is successfully planted in Geneva by Farel.\r\n\r\n    1536 Bern conquers Vaud and Lausanne and takes them from Savoy.\r\n    Calvin comes to Geneva.

He enters upon a harsh rule,\r\n    imprisoning and executing his opponents.\r\n\r\n    1548 Constance is captured by the Austrians in the war of\r\n    Smalkalden and is cut off from the Swiss Confederation.\r\n\r\n    1549 Calvin’s theological disputes with the Zurich reformers\r\n    are partly settled by the Compromise of Zurich (_Consensus\r\n    Tigurinus_).\r\n\r\n    1553 Michael Servetus is burned at the stake at Geneva at the\r\n    instance of Calvin.\r\n\r\n    1555 Calvin expels from Geneva many who uphold municipal\r\n    liberty and replaces them by foreigners. The city gains the\r\n    name of the “Protestant Rome.” Evangelicals driven out of\r\n    Locarno take refuge in Zurich.\r\n\r\n    1559 Calvin founds the University of Geneva.\r\n\r\n    1564 Calvin dies. Théodore de Beze succeeds him as head of the\r\n    church. Emanuel Philibert, duke of Savoy, supported by the\r\n    Catholic members of the league, demands back the districts\r\n    seized by Bern in 1536. The Treaty of Lausanne restores\r\n    several of them. The counter-Reformation (Catholic reaction)\r\n    makes itself strongly felt in Switzerland. It is furthered by\r\n    Carlo Borromeo, archbishop of Milan, and at Lucerne by Ludwig\r\n    Pfyffer, the “Swiss king.”\r\n\r\n    1565 The Catholic states of Switzerland ally themselves with\r\n    Pope Pius IV.\r\n\r\n    1566 The second Helvetic Confession is published as a basis for\r\n    union between the Calvinists and the Zurich reformers.\r\n\r\n    1574 The Catholic reaction advances by the establishment of the\r\n    Jesuits at Lucerne.\r\n\r\n    1580 A papal nuncio comes to Lucerne. Borromeo founds at Milan\r\n    the “Collegium Helveticum” for the education of Swiss priests.\r\n\r\n    1581 The Capuchins become active in Switzerland for the\r\n    Catholic reaction.\r\n\r\n    1582 The Protestants object to the introduction of the\r\n    Gregorian calendar.\r\n\r\n    1586 The Golden or Borromean League for support of Catholicism\r\n    is formed by the seven Catholic members of the confederation\r\n    (Uri, Schwyz, Unterwalden, Lucerne, Zug, Freiburg, Solothurn).\r\n\r\n    1588 The reformed states form a separate league with Strasburg.\r\n\r\n    1597 Appenzell is divided into two parts, “Inner Rhodes,”\r\n    Catholic, and “Outer Rhodes,” Protestant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY\r\n\r\n    1602 The Duke of Savoy attempts to get hold of Geneva (the\r\n    “Escalade”).\r\n\r\n    1620 Massacre of Protestants in the Valtellina. The valley\r\n    is won for the Catholics.

Poverty, a result of the Thirty Years’ War,\r\n    causes discontent.\r\n\r\n    1653 The Peasants’ War breaks out in Bern, Solothurn, Lucerne,\r\n    and Bâle because of the oppression of the governing class.\r\n    The peasants form a league of Sumiswald. They are defeated at\r\n    Wohlenschwyl.\r\n\r\n    1654 The Protestant Swiss intercede for the Waldenses. They\r\n    win the friendship of Oliver Cromwell, who pays great honor to\r\n    their envoys.\r\n\r\n    1655 Protestant fugitives from Schwyz find refuge in Zurich.\r\n\r\n    1656 The first Villmergen War results.

A treaty is concluded which provides for the\r\n    individual sovereignty of each member of the confederation in\r\n    religious matters.\r\n\r\n    1663 The confederation makes a treaty with Louis XIV of France,\r\n    by which Protestant Swiss mercenaries are taken into the king’s\r\n    pay.\r\n\r\n    1668 As the result of encroachments by Louis in the\r\n    Franche-Comté the confederates provide for joint action against\r\n    outside enemies by putting into execution the agreement known\r\n    as the Defensionale. French Protestant refugees find shelter in\r\n    Switzerland.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY\r\n\r\n    1707 Pierre Fatio at the head of a committee of the council at\r\n    Geneva demands a more liberal government.\r\n\r\n    1712 The abbot of St. Gall by his oppressions rouses the people\r\n    of Toggenburg to insurrection. The second Villmergen War (or\r\n    war of Toggenburg) between Catholics and Protestants from these\r\n    troubles. The Catholics are defeated at Villmergen. The Treaty\r\n    of Aarau assures the “common bailiwicks” religious liberty and\r\n    gives advantages to the Protestants.\r\n\r\n    1715 The Catholic members of the confederation by the Truckli\r\n    Bund agree to put France in the position of guarantor of the\r\n    confederation. A period of decline. The confederation has\r\n    little unity. Unsatisfactory relations of the classes.\r\n\r\n    1723 The conspiracy of Davel to free Vaud from the oppression\r\n    of Bern is crushed.\r\n\r\n    1729 The “_Harten_” (hard ones) opponents of the government,\r\n    and the “_Linden_” (soft ones) at Zug struggle for supremacy.\r\n\r\n    1732 The “Harten” gain a victory over the “Linden” in the Outer\r\n    Rhodes of Appenzell.\r\n\r\n    1737 The democrats win a victory for liberal government in\r\n    Geneva.\r\n\r\n    1744 Demands for a more liberal government are made in Bern.\r\n\r\n    1749 Hentzi’s conspiracy attempts in vain to overthrow the\r\n    oligarchy at Bern.\r\n\r\n    1748 Discontents of the common people cause disorder in\r\n    Neuchâtel.\r\n\r\n    1755 Popular uprisings in the Leventina are crushed by the\r\n    government of Uri.\r\n\r\n    1762 The Helvetic Society is founded and fosters aspirations\r\n    for liberty. Rousseau, then a citizen of Geneva, publishes the\r\n    _Contrat Social_. These books are publicly burned by order of\r\n    the city government. The popular party wins in the Outer Rhodes\r\n    of Appenzell.\r\n\r\n    1764 The “Harten” are victorious in Zug.\r\n\r\n    1768 Armed intervention of France, Zurich, and Bern in Geneva\r\n    to suppress popular revolts of the “natives.” Disorders occur\r\n    in the patriciate of Lucerne.\r\n\r\n    1770 The “natives” rise in revolt in Geneva.\r\n\r\n    1777 All of the thirteen states of the confederation join in\r\n    making a new alliance with France. Political disturbances occur\r\n    in Zurich.\r\n\r\n    1780 The meetings of the Helvetic Society are forbidden.\r\n\r\n    1781 Anarchy in Geneva. Pastor Waser is executed at Zurich for\r\n    opposition to the city government. France, Bern, and Sardinia\r\n    intervene. Emigration from Geneva.

The club stirs\r\n    up risings in the western part of the confederation. Lower\r\n    Valais rises against the oppressive rule of the upper districts.\r\n\r\n    1792 Porrentruy defies the prince-bishop of Bâle; with the\r\n    help of the French drives out the imperial troops; forms\r\n    the Rauracian Republic. This afterward becomes the French\r\n    department of Mont Terrible. Geneva is saved from France by a\r\n    force from Zurich and Bern. Massacre of the Swiss guards at the\r\n    Tuileries by the Paris mob. The diet of Aarau orders the recall\r\n    of the Swiss regiments.\r\n\r\n    1793 A reign of terror begins in Geneva because of uprising of\r\n    the “natives.”\r\n\r\n    1794 The revolutionary party assumes control in Geneva. Arrests\r\n    and murders. Demands for greater freedom are made at Stäfa in\r\n    the territory of Zurich.\r\n\r\n    1795 A reaction sets in in Geneva. The insurrection at Stäfa is\r\n    suppressed.\r\n\r\n    1797 Bonaparte incorporates the Italian bailiwicks of the\r\n    Valtellina with the Cisalpine Republic. La Harpe calls on\r\n    the Directory to protect the liberties of Vaud against the\r\n    oppression of Bern.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE HELVETIC REPUBLIC\r\n\r\n    1798 French troops in response occupy Mülhausen, Bienne, and\r\n    part of the lands of the prince-bishop of Bâle. Insurgents\r\n    open the prison of Chillon. Another French army enters Vaud\r\n    and the Lemanic Republic is proclaimed there. The French\r\n    occupy Fribourg and Solothurn; defeat the Bernese after\r\n    fierce fighting at Neueneck; take Bern, the stronghold of the\r\n    aristocratic party, and pillage the treasury. The Revolution\r\n    triumphs over the Confederation. By order of the Directory,\r\n    the Helvetic Republic, one and indivisible, is proclaimed.\r\n    Peter Ochs of Bâle supplies a constitution. Ten of the thirteen\r\n    members of the old confederation accept the new government.\r\n    Twenty-three “cantons,” or administrative districts, are\r\n    created. The forest districts rebel. Their resistance, headed\r\n    by Alois Reding, of Schwyz, is put down after desperate\r\n    conflicts at Schindellegi, Morgarten, and at Rothenthurm.\r\n    An insurrection of the mountaineers of Upper Valais against\r\n    the French is bloodily repressed. The French put down an\r\n    insurrection in Nidwald with great bloodshed. (The days of\r\n    terror of Nidwald end.)\r\n\r\n    1799 Zurich, the forest cantons, and Rhætia become the scene of\r\n    the struggle of the Austrian and Russians against the French in\r\n    the wars of the Coalition.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE NINETEENTH CENTURY\r\n\r\n    1802 Strife between the centralists and the federalists.\r\n    Bonaparte withdraws the French troops. The Helvetian government\r\n    is driven from Bern. Bonaparte convenes Swiss statesmen at\r\n    Paris in the _consulta_, and acts as mediator. The Frickthal,\r\n    the last Austrian possession in Switzerland, is given to the\r\n    Helvetic Republic by Bonaparte.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CONFEDERATION OF NINETEEN CANTONS\r\n\r\n    1803 Napoleon’s Act of Mediation is made the constitution of\r\n    “Switzerland.” This name for the first time is used as the\r\n    official name of the country. The thirteen members of the old\r\n    confederation are set up again and six new cantons are added.\r\n    There are to be no more privileged classes or subject lands.\r\n    Switzerland enjoys ten years of peace and prosperity.\r\n\r\n    1804 Insurrection breaks out at Horgen in the canton Zurich.\r\n\r\n    1806 Neuchâtel is given to Marshal Berthier.\r\n\r\n    1810 Valais, which has been a separate republic, is made into\r\n    the French department of the Simplon. The Swiss Society of the\r\n    Public Good is founded. Pestalozzi and Fellenberg work out an\r\n    educational system.\r\n\r\n    1813 Austrian and Russian troops, supported by the reactionary\r\n    party, enter Switzerland; the diet abolishes the constitution\r\n    of 1803.\r\n\r\n    1814 “The long diet” at Zurich attempts to adjust party\r\n    differences. Bern heads a party anxious to restore the old\r\n    order. Zurich and the majority stand out for the nineteen\r\n    cantons of Napoleon. The allies enter Switzerland.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE LEAGUE OF TWENTY-TWO STATES\r\n\r\n    1815 The Swiss diet accepts the decisions of the congress of\r\n    Vienna and a new constitution, the Federal Pact, is adopted.\r\n    The league of States (_Staatenbund_) is made to include\r\n    twenty-two members. The sovereign rights of each canton are\r\n    recognised. The federal diet exercises supreme sovereignty only\r\n    in purely national concerns. The great powers at the congress\r\n    of Vienna guarantee the neutrality of Switzerland. Switzerland\r\n    is freed from subserviency to France. New aristocracies make\r\n    themselves felt.\r\n\r\n    1817 Switzerland becomes a party to the Holy Alliance.\r\n\r\n    1819 The Helvetic Society again takes up political reforms.\r\n\r\n    1823 Freedom of the press is restricted under influence of the\r\n    great powers. Intellectual reaction and ultra-montanism become\r\n    noticeable and cause dissensions.\r\n\r\n    1830 The July revolution in Paris finds an echo in Switzerland.\r\n    Twelve cantons reform their constitutions in a democratic\r\n    sense. Popular demonstrations at the assembly of Uster.\r\n\r\n    1831 The aristocracy of Bern submits to liberal reforms.\r\n\r\n    1832 The cantons Zurich, Bern, Lucerne, Solothurn, St. Gall,\r\n    Aargau, and Thurgau agree to united action looking toward\r\n    reform (_Siebener Concordat_). They are opposed by the\r\n    reactionary cantons, Uri, Schwyz, Unterwalden, Valais, and\r\n    Neuchâtel which form the league of Sarnen (Sarner Bund).\r\n\r\n    1833 Bâle is divided into a rural (Baselland) and an urban\r\n    (Baselstadt) half-canton because of the desire of the rural\r\n    population for proportional representation in the Diet.\r\n\r\n    1834 Political refugees to Switzerland increase to such an\r\n    extent that measures are taken by the diet to prevent abuse of\r\n    the privilege of asylum.\r\n\r\n    1835 Religious tumults in Aargau.\r\n\r\n    1836 Difficulties with France over tariff regulations.\r\n    Religious tumults in the Bernese Jura.\r\n\r\n    1838 The Society of the Grütli is founded at Geneva.\r\n\r\n    1839 Reaction in Zurich against radicals and freethinkers.\r\n    (Strauss’ _Life of Jesus_).\r\n\r\n    1840 Clericals revolt against the radicals in Aargau.\r\n\r\n    1841 They are put down. Eight monasteries in Aargau are\r\n    suppressed. The quarrel provokes disputes in the diet.\r\n\r\n    1843 The diet effects a compromise in the religious quarrel\r\n    in Aargau by which four instead of eight of the monasteries\r\n    are suppressed. The seven Catholic cantons, Uri, Schwyz,\r\n    Unterwalden, Lucerne, Zug, Fribourg, and Valais hereupon form a\r\n    separate league, the Sonderbund.\r\n\r\n    1844 The Sonderbund declares for the reopening of all the\r\n    monasteries in Aargau. The clericals in Lucerne, the Vorort,\r\n    give high posts to Jesuits. Parties of free-lances attempt to\r\n    capture the city.\r\n\r\n    1845 The attack on Lucerne is renewed but is unsuccessful. The\r\n    radicals gain control in Zurich.\r\n\r\n    1846 The radicals become the majority in Bern and Geneva.\r\n\r\n    1847 The radicals get a majority in St. Gall. The diet in which\r\n    the radicals are now in the majority declares the Sonderbund\r\n    contrary to the Federal Pact. The diet resolves to revise the\r\n    pact and asks the cantons to expel the Jesuits. The attempt to\r\n    enforce the decree leads to the Sonderbund War. This is quickly\r\n    ended by the defeat of the rebellious Catholic cantons at\r\n    Gislikon, largely because of the good generalship of Dufour.\r\n\r\n\r\nSWITZERLAND AS A FEDERAL STATE\r\n\r\n    1848 A new constitution is accepted by the majority of the\r\n    cantons. Switzerland becomes a federal state (_Bundesstaat_).\r\n    A central government is organised consisting of a council of\r\n    states (_Ständerath_), a national council (_National Rath_) and\r\n    a federal council or executive (_Bundesrath_). German, French,\r\n    and Italian are recognised as national languages. Bern is\r\n    chosen the national capital.\r\n\r\n    1855 The federal polytechnic school is opened at Zurich.\r\n    Improvements in the educational system are introduced.\r\n\r\n    1856 A royalist conspiracy in Neuchâtel is put down and causes\r\n    a dispute between Switzerland and the king of Prussia, the\r\n    overlord of Neuchâtel.\r\n\r\n    1857 Neuchâtel is definitely ceded to Switzerland.\r\n\r\n    1859 Switzerland posts troops on the Italian frontier to\r\n    preserve neutrality in the Italian War and puts an end to\r\n    foreign enlistments.\r\n\r\n    1860 The Swiss government protests against the cession of Nice\r\n    and Savoy to France.\r\n\r\n    1861 French troops occupy the Valée de Dappes.\r\n\r\n    1862 The question of the frontiers in the Valée de Dappes is\r\n    arranged with France by mutual cession of territory.\r\n\r\n    1864 The convention of Geneva introduces humanitarian reforms\r\n    in warfare. Election riots at Geneva lead to bloodshed.\r\n\r\n    1865 International social science congress meets at Bern.\r\n\r\n    1866 Restrictions on religious liberty of Jesuits, etc., are\r\n    removed. An attempt is made to revise the constitution in a\r\n    democratic sense but fails.\r\n\r\n    1867 An international congress of workmen is held at Lausanne.\r\n\r\n    1869 The construction of the St. Gotthard tunnel is decided\r\n    upon.\r\n\r\n    1871 Switzerland shelters French refugees of the Franco-German\r\n    War though insisting on the maintenance of neutrality. The\r\n    growth in power of the “old Catholics” causes disturbances in\r\n    western Switzerland (the struggle against Ultramontanism). The\r\n    Alabama Arbitration Commission meets in Geneva.\r\n\r\n    1872 An attempt at revision of the constitution is defeated by\r\n    a small majority.\r\n\r\n    1873 Abbé Mermillod, appointed by the pope “apostolic vicar” of\r\n    Geneva, is banished from Switzerland. The see of Bishop Lachat\r\n    of Bâle is suppressed by several cantons because he upholds the\r\n    doctrine of papal infallibility.\r\n\r\n\r\nSWITZERLAND UNDER THE CONSTITUTION OF 1874\r\n\r\n    1874 A new constitution, a revision of that of 1848, is\r\n    accepted by the people. The referendum hereby becomes a part\r\n    of the machinery of the federal government as it had already\r\n    been part of that of most of the cantons. The new constitution\r\n    increases centralisation in the government. The international\r\n    postal congress meets at Bern and lays the foundation for the\r\n    international postal union.\r\n\r\n    1876 Religious and political differences cause an armed\r\n    encounter in Ticino.\r\n\r\n    1877 A law regulating the working hours in factories is passed,\r\n    marking an advance in labour legislation.\r\n\r\n    1878 James Fazy, noted statesman, dies.\r\n\r\n    1879 Legislation puts an end to dissensions over the\r\n    financeering of the St. Gotthard railway.\r\n\r\n    1882 The St. Gotthard railway is opened.\r\n\r\n    1883 Mermillod is appointed bishop of Lausanne.\r\n\r\n    1884 Bishop Lachat is made apostolic vicar of Ticino. An\r\n    international conference is held at Bern to secure the\r\n    protection of copyright.\r\n\r\n    1887 Alcohol is made a state monopoly.\r\n\r\n    1888 The creation of a see at Lugano excites the opposition of\r\n    the radicals. An important law for the protection of patents is\r\n    passed.\r\n\r\n    1889 Bismarck’s spy Wohlgemuth is expelled. Germany protests.\r\n    Difficulties arising out of the Swiss custom of granting\r\n    political asylum are settled.\r\n\r\n    1890 Religious riot at Ticino. The principal compulsory\r\n    insurance against sickness and accident is accepted by popular\r\n    vote.\r\n\r\n    1891 The federal constitution is amended so that fifty thousand\r\n    citizens by the “initiative” can compel the federal authorities\r\n    to prepare and submit to the people any reform in the\r\n    constitution demanded by the petitioners. The establishment of\r\n    a state or federal bank is approved by the people. The purchase\r\n    of the Central Railway by the confederation is rejected by\r\n    popular vote.\r\n\r\n    1893 The killing of animals in Jewish fashion is prohibited by\r\n    exercise of the initiative.\r\n\r\n    1894 An attempt by the initiative to secure the adoption for\r\n    the government of a socialist scheme to provide employment\r\n    fails.\r\n\r\n    1896 A National exhibition is held at Geneva. Labour riots\r\n    directed against the employment of Italians cause many of these\r\n    to leave Zurich. The eighteenth international congress on\r\n    copyright meets at Bern and takes steps for copyright reform in\r\n    Germany and Great Britain.\r\n\r\n    1897 The national council adopts a bill authorising the\r\n    confederation to purchase the five principal railroads when\r\n    the terms of the concessions expire. The proposals of the\r\n    government as to a federal bank are rejected by the people.\r\n    An international congress for the protection of labor is held\r\n    at Zurich. It votes in favor of the prohibition of Sunday\r\n    labor, except under special conditions for the restriction of\r\n    unhealthful trades and night-work, for the betterment of the\r\n    conditions of employment for women and for a working day of\r\n    eight hours by legal enactment.\r\n\r\n    1898 The government authorises the construction of the Simplon\r\n    tunnel. The people vote for the unification of the cantonal\r\n    laws civil and criminal into a set of federal codes. The\r\n    principle of the purchase by the confederation of the principal\r\n    railroads is approved by popular vote. The empress Elizabeth\r\n    of Austria is assassinated by an Italian anarchist in Geneva.\r\n    Expulsion of anarchists follows.\r\n\r\n    1899 The scheme for the establishment of the “double\r\n    initiative” is launched. The law for the compulsory insurance\r\n    of working men against sickness and accident is passed by the\r\n    legislature.\r\n\r\n    1900 This proposal, however, is rejected by the people by a\r\n    large majority. The proposals for proportional representation\r\n    in the national council and for the election of the federal\r\n    council by the people (the “double initiative”) are rejected by\r\n    popular vote.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE TWENTIETH CENTURY\r\n\r\n    1901 On representation of the Turkish government the federal\r\n    council suppresses publications of the party of Young Turkey\r\n    criticising the sultan for the Armenian massacres. Public\r\n    opinion condemning the action of the council as a violation\r\n    of the right of asylum finds expression in many places.\r\n    Anti-Russian demonstrations are made at Geneva and Bern by\r\n    socialists. The socialist movement gains in strength.\r\n\r\n    1902 Difficulties with Italy over the publication in an\r\n    anarchist organ at Geneva of an article reflecting on the\r\n    murdered king Humbert causes the temporary withdrawal of the\r\n    diplomatic representatives of the two countries. A general\r\n    strike in Geneva leads to disturbances which are put down by\r\n    troops. The federal council issues a decree suppressing such\r\n    religious congregations or orders as have not been authorised\r\n    by law. The radical democratic majority in the national council\r\n    is considerably strengthened.\r\n\r\n    1903 A new protective tariff is adopted by popular vote. The\r\n    Zionist congress at Bâle votes to investigate Great Britain’s\r\n    offer of land in East Africa for Jewish colonisation.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 PART XXI\r\n\r\n                          THE HISTORY OF RUSSIA\r\n\r\n               BASED CHIEFLY UPON THE FOLLOWING AUTHORITIES\r\n\r\n    R.

A. S. RAPPOPORT\r\n\r\nSchool of Oriental Languages, Paris\r\n\r\n\r\n“Russia evolves very slowly, like an empire that is not of yesterday and\r\nthat has ample time before it,” is one of Nietzsche’s remarks before his\r\nreason had hopelessly gone adrift in the vast ocean of insanity. This\r\nremark of the German poet-philosopher is true enough. What Nietzsche,\r\nhowever, did not know or did not say is that one can hardly speak of any\r\nevolution, as far as general civilisation, intellectual culture, and\r\ndevelopment are concerned, of Russia as a whole. Only a small minority,\r\nthe so-called _intelligentia_, has evolved intellectually, not Russia\r\nitself. Here lies the fundamental difference between Russia and the rest\r\nof Europe.\r\n\r\nThere is a vast gulf, ever broadening, between the Russian intelligentia\r\nand the _muyiks_. Thought and culture, nay even civilisation, seem to\r\nbe limited to a select few. The bulk of the people has not only failed\r\nto advance from a state in which it was surprised by Jenghiz Khan, but\r\nit has actually retrograded to a more savage condition. Revolutions\r\nhave passed over their heads without in the least affecting them. “The\r\nRussian masses,” says Leroy-Beaulieu (_The Empire of the Czars_), “have\r\nnot felt the breath of either the Renaissance, or the Reformation, or\r\nthe Revolution. All that has been done in Europe or America for the last\r\nfour centuries, since the time of Columbus and Luther, Washington and\r\nMirabeau, is, as far as Russia is concerned, non-existent.”\r\n\r\nThe people never think, or at least have not yet left that crude state\r\nof barbarism which precedes the dawn of civilisation; the first rays\r\nof thought have scarcely tinted with orient hues the dark horizon\r\nof ignorance and superstition of the Russian population; the great\r\nevents have failed to stir its mental inertia. I am, however, far from\r\nmaintaining that the fault lies with the nature and national character\r\nof the people. The rich nature, the subtle spirit of the Slav, his\r\npower of adaptation and imitation make him not only accessible to\r\nwestern civilisation and culture but also capable of producing something\r\nwhich bears the impress of the peculiarity of the Slavonic genius. The\r\nintelligentia is now giving ample proof corroborating this statement.\r\nThe Russian intelligentia has passed the phases of growing and changing\r\nand doubting and has reached a condition of maturity, asserting its\r\nmanhood and right. Before examining the intellectual development of the\r\nRussian intelligentia and the point it has reached, as compared with\r\nwestern Europe, we must try to find out the causes that first produced\r\nthat gulf between the few and the many, and the circumstances that were\r\ninstrumental in widening it.\r\n\r\nIt is a mistake to imagine that the very first foundations of Russian\r\nintellectual development were laid by Peter the Great and that Russia,\r\nalthough behind western Europe in culture and civilisation, is still in\r\nher youthful vigour and freshness and will soon overtake the old world.\r\nThere was a time, at the beginning of the eleventh century, when the\r\nSlavonic countries under the rule of the Norman conquerors were on the\r\nsame level of civilisation as western Europe. The foundations were laid\r\nbefore the Norman invasion and very frequent were the relations between\r\nthis people in the east and those in the north of Europe. Long before the\r\nninth century, Kiev was known to the inhabitants of Scandinavia. Many\r\na jarl sought refuge there and many a merchant ship found its way to\r\nthe shores of Russia. On the road along which the commercial connection\r\nbetween the East Sea and Byzantium developed were situated the towns of\r\nSmolensk, Tchernigov, Pereiaslavl (cf. V. der Brüggen, _Wie Russland\r\nEuropaisch Wurde_, p. 22). When the Norman princes, the warags as they\r\nwere called by the Slavonic nations, conquered these towns and subdued\r\none tribe after the other, the already existing civilisation developed\r\nrapidly under the protection of the new rulers. Forth from Byzantium\r\nand Greece, from Italy, Poland, and Germany, with which countries the\r\ndescendants of Rurik kept up a connection, western influence came to\r\nthe north. Learned monks came from Byzantium, architects, artisans,\r\nand merchants from Greece, Italy and Germany, and were instrumental in\r\nspreading the languages, customs and ideas of the west. Not only did the\r\n_kniazi_ (princes) of Kiev build churches and edifices after the model\r\nof Greek and Italian art, but they established schools to which Vladimir\r\ncompelled his nobles and boyars to send their children. The commercial\r\nrelations with the west and the south were very vivid and frequent, and\r\non the market places of Kiev and Novgorod a motley crowd of Normans and\r\nSlavs, Hungarians, Greeks, Venetians, Germans, Arabs, and Jews were to be\r\nseen.\r\n\r\nThe intellectual culture of the time had not yet, one must admit,\r\npenetrated the masses of the Slavonic tribes. Yet the Normans, as the\r\npropagators of culture, speedily and easily merged into one with the\r\nconquered tribes, much easier perhaps than the Normans who came with\r\nWilliam the Conqueror amalgamated with Britons and Saxons in England.\r\nHad the Tatar invasion not taken place, it is highly probable that the\r\nintellectual development of Russia would have followed the same lines\r\nas that of western Europe. The commercial and intellectual relations\r\nwith the rest of Europe, so eagerly sought after and cultivated by the\r\nNorman princes, would have continued and brought the Slav countries in\r\nincreasingly closer contact with the west and under the influence of\r\nall the currents that were destined to traverse Europe later on. The\r\nRenaissance and the revival of learning which shed their light upon the\r\ndark mediæval age (and only a few rays of which found their way to Russia\r\nby way of Poland at a much later period) would have made themselves felt\r\nin Russia. This was, however, not to happen. The Mongolian invasion had\r\nactually cut off Russia from Europe, and brought it under the Tatar\r\ninfluence. The Norman civilisation, which was in a nascent state, was\r\ncrushed; the threads connecting Russia with Europe were cut off. The wave\r\nof Mongolian invasion had inundated the flat land situated between Europe\r\nand Asia, carried away and destroyed every vestige of western influence.\r\nKiev, Moscow, Tver, Riazan, Tchernigov, and Smolensk were conquered by\r\nthe hordes of the Great Khan, who from his seat somewhere in the heart of\r\nChina or in the centre of Asia sent down his generals and tax collectors.\r\n\r\nHundreds of thousands of Mongols came to Russia, mixed with the Slavs,\r\nand influenced habits, customs, civilisation, social life, administration\r\nand even language. The influence was a very far-reaching and deep one;\r\nMongolism has penetrated Russian life to a much higher degree than a\r\nRussian would care to admit or western Europeans have realised. Greater\r\nand greater became the gulf between the Russian and the Romance and\r\nTeutonic worlds. But that gulf might have been bridged over and Russia\r\nmight have been saved, when the dawn of better and happier days broke in,\r\nby another power: the influence of the church. Here again, however, owing\r\nto circumstances, this in many respects civilising agent was powerless.\r\n\r\nIn spite of all the reproaches hurled at the church, it must be admitted\r\nthat it had all the education in its hands. In Russia, however, the\r\ncase was different. From the very beginning, ever since Christianity\r\nwas introduced, ever since Vladimir had accepted baptism in Kiev, the\r\nRussian people as Christians were divided into two distinct groups.\r\nWhilst the enthusiastic adherents of the new religion endeavoured to\r\nintroduce the piety of Byzantium, the mass of the people, although\r\nnominally Christian, remained heathen in reality and has remained so up\r\nto the present. This was due to two reasons. Vladimir had accepted the\r\nGreek form of worship with its asceticism. Asceticism and monasticism, a\r\nretirement from the world, became the Christian ideal. This ideal was too\r\nhigh, too unattainable and too foreign for reality and for daily life,\r\nwhilst on the other hand the perfect Christians considered the life of\r\nthe world as sinful and dangerous. Thus the clergy sought retirement in\r\ncloisters and monasteries and the mass, whilst accepting the ceremonies\r\nof Byzantium, had learned nothing of its ethical teachings. The gulf thus\r\narising between clergy and people was also due to another reason. The\r\nfirst members of the clergy were Greeks, monks coming from Byzantium,\r\nwho spoke a language incomprehensible to the Slavs. The Russian bishops,\r\nwho gradually took the place of the learned eastern monks, and who could\r\ncommunicate with the people, were still too ignorant themselves. And\r\nthen suddenly the Tatar invasion came. Connection with Byzantium was cut\r\noff. The influx of the Greek clergy and Byzantine learning had ceased\r\ntoo early, before the Russians had had time to acquire some amount of\r\nknowledge to replace it. Thus whilst the intellectual development of the\r\nmass took place very slowly, the intellectual level of the clergy sank\r\nrapidly. The consequence was that when the Russian clergy met the people\r\nthey were both on the same intellectual level, the priests had nothing\r\nto teach and had no prestige. This also explains, psychologically, the\r\norigin of so many religious sects in Russia. Having no respect and no\r\nadmiration for the ignorant priest, addicted to drink, the peasant goes\r\nhis own way when he suddenly feels a craving for religious ideals.\r\n\r\nThus the Mongolian invasion had cut off Russia from Europe and whilst\r\nthe latter was passing through the phases of transition, approaching\r\nslowly but gradually the times of light and learning, Russia stood still.\r\nThe Europe of the Renaissance was not a _creatio ex nihilo_. It was the\r\nresult of a slow process of development. The barbarians who had built\r\ntheir realms on the ruins of the ancient worlds, Hellas and Rome, had\r\ntaken over the classical heritage left to them after the disappearance\r\nof the Roman Empire. Rude and barbarous, however, these new conquerors\r\nhad no understanding for the value of the heritage and destroyed many\r\nof its richest treasures. Worlds of intellectual culture were lost. But\r\nslowly the age of understanding dawned and the former barbarians brought\r\nforth many of the treasures which they had relegated to the lumber-room,\r\nadded many of their own, and blended them into one whole. The result\r\nwas the Græco-Roman, Romance, and Teutonic civilisation. Crusades,\r\nArabian civilisation passing by way of Spain, scholasticism, Reformation,\r\nRenaissance, revival of learning, the discovery of new worlds, the spread\r\nof commerce, scientific inventions and discoveries, stimulating the\r\ndesire for learning and creating impulses in every new direction--all\r\nthese new and stirring events were so many phases through which European\r\nsociety and European life passed before they reached the state of modern\r\ndevelopment. Many were the streams and cross-currents that traversed\r\nEurope separately before they united and continued the more rapid advance\r\nof a new life and civilisation. All this was lacking in Russia. Russia\r\nmissed during its Mongolian period, the time of general transition. None\r\nof the forces which, although invisibly, were steadily furrowing the\r\nEuropean soil and preparing it for the influx of fresh air and new light,\r\nwere at work in Russia. The phase of transition had not yet commenced.\r\nThat period of constant change, of mingled decadence and spiritual\r\ngrowth, that ceaseless blending of the old and the new, unnoticed at\r\nthe time but clearly distinguished from the distance of later ages,\r\nwas lacking in Russia. There was no pope, no powerful church, and\r\nconsequently no Reformation and no spirit of individualism--no feudalism,\r\nno knights, no Crusades and no acquaintance with foreign lands, no spread\r\nof commerce, and no widening of the mental horizon of the people. There\r\nwere no learned monks copying Greek and Latin manuscripts, paving the way\r\nfor scholasticism and modern thought. There was even no language in which\r\nthe treasures of the ancient world could be communicated to the Slavs.\r\nFew people could write, few even count properly.\r\n\r\nThere were no schools and the attempts to establish some such\r\ninstitutions during the seventeenth century failed. A school was founded\r\nat Moscow under Alexis, but here only a foreign language or two were\r\ntaught. Its aim was to train translators for the government. There was no\r\nart, nor technical science. There were no medical men. The two or three\r\nforeign practitioners were considered as sorcerers.\r\n\r\nTowards the end of the seventeenth century therefore Russia had\r\nabsolutely no culture of her own. All that the Normans had established\r\nhad been wiped out. The Byzantine influence had no effect. And when\r\nafter a struggle extending over three centuries the czardom of Moscow\r\nhad thrown off the shackles of the Great Khan, liberated itself from\r\nthraldom and laid the foundations of the great empire of Russia, it had\r\nonly established, on the ruins of the old Mongolian, a new state which\r\nwas Mongolian and Tatar in its essence and spirit, in its customs and\r\ninstitutions, and had little or nothing in common with the rest of Europe.\r\n\r\nMoscow was the inheritor of Mongolism, the Czar was spiritually, and\r\neven physically, a descendant of Mongol princes. Ivan IV married a\r\nMongolian princess, his son married a sister of the Mongol Godunov. They\r\nhad actually taken over the inheritance of the khans of Kiptchak. It was\r\nin this barren soil that Peter sowed the seed of European culture. What\r\nhappened?\r\n\r\nPeter was undoubtedly great and deserves this title. He was one of the\r\ngreat makers of history. But though great in his plans, great in what\r\nhe wished to accomplish, he was not great in what he really attained.\r\nHe only saw the superficiality of European civilisation. He introduced\r\nit like some foreign product, like some fashionable article, like\r\nsome exotic plant, without first asking whether the national soil was\r\npropitious for its cultivation. He, at the utmost, created a hot-house\r\natmosphere where his plants could vegetate, and they remained what they\r\noriginally were: exotic. He failed to see that civilisation is the\r\nproduct of a long process of evolution, the natural product of the social\r\nand national conditions, drawing its life and sap from the inner forces\r\nof the people. Instead of making use of these inner forces of his people,\r\nhe endeavoured to introduce civilisation by his power of will. He only\r\nhad an eye for the effects but not for the causes that were working as\r\nthe hidden springs.\r\n\r\nIn France, in England, in Germany, in all western Europe, civilisation,\r\nthe moral and intellectual evolution, was a natural phenomenon, the\r\neffect of previous causes. In Russia, civilisation was the outcome of a\r\nsudden revolution, the slavish, reluctant and half-hearted compliance\r\nwith the commands of an individual will. The former was natural, the\r\nlatter artificial. An evolution is a slow change, an unconscious and\r\nimperceptible process, finding a state prepared for innovation, a soil,\r\nfurrowed and fertile, ready to receive the seed and to bring forth fruit.\r\nA revolution, on the other hand, is a radical, sudden change which seldom\r\nsucceeds and, in most cases, calls forth reactions. In Western Europe\r\nthere was, as we have see above, a time of transition from the barbarous\r\nto the civilised state. The morning of the Renaissance had dawned upon\r\nmediæval Europe and tinted with orient colours the sombre sky. The\r\nfirst rays appeared on the horizon of the Italian poets, dissipating\r\nthe darkness here and there. The sun gradually rose higher and higher,\r\npenetrated the houses of the people and woke them (who had been lulled to\r\nsleep by the mysterious whisperings of superstition) from their prolonged\r\nslumbers. They awoke, opened their windows and allowed the light of the\r\nmorning to penetrate into their dark abodes. Not so in Russia. There\r\nthe people were suddenly awakened, dragged out from the utter darkness,\r\nwithout any transition, into the broad midday of an artificial light.\r\nThey opened their eyes, but the light was too strong, too glaring; so\r\nthey shut them again. Peter wanted to jump over three centuries and\r\ncatch up with Europe. He established a fleet without Russian sailors,\r\nan administration with foreign administrators, an academy of science\r\nin a land without elementary schools. He began a race with Europe but\r\nhis people could not follow him. He borrowed everything from Europe\r\nand instead of giving his people a chance to develop naturally and\r\nfreely, he crushed the spirit of independence and introduced a knout\r\ncivilisation. Everything had to be done by order. He forced his people\r\nto swallow Europeanism. The bulk of his subjects, however, could not\r\ndigest it. The consequence was that they could not follow the few, and\r\nremained far behind them. The gulf therefore between the few, who form\r\nthe present intelligentia, and the great mass--a gulf which was but\r\nnarrow towards the end of the sixteenth century when by way of Poland and\r\nLivonia a glimpse of the western sun penetrated into Russia--suddenly\r\nwidened considerably. Thus the origin of the striking phenomenon which\r\nRussia offers in her intellectually high developed intelligentia and her\r\nuneducated, ignorant masses is to be sought in Russia’s past, in the\r\nabsence of a period of transition, and in Peter’s misunderstanding the\r\nprocess of European civilisation, in his admiration for the effects, but\r\nutter ignorance of the causes that brought about these effects.\r\n\r\nThere is, however, yet another factor--a factor which, whilst accounting\r\nfor the existence of an intelligentia, or a coterie of intellectuals,\r\nand of an utterly ignorant mass, will also throw some light upon the\r\nintellectual development of this very intelligentia and explain the\r\nreasons which compelled it to choose certain channels by which it\r\nsends forth the currents of its thoughts. This factor is the despotic\r\ngovernment of the czars. If Russia’s unhappy past and Peter’s good\r\nintentions but great blunders produced the present state of intellectual\r\ndevelopment in that country, the government of the Reformer’s successors\r\nhas done its very best to preserve this condition.\r\n\r\nThe continuous policy of the Russian government to civilise by means of\r\nthe knout has on the one hand brought about the result that not Russia\r\nbut only a few Russians evolved intellectually and, on the other, it has\r\ngiven a certain direction to the thought and intellectual productions of\r\nthese few. Even during the reign of Peter I or Catherine II, when the\r\nspirit of civilisation began to move its wings, independent thought has\r\nhad to sustain a fierce struggle against authority. In the most civilised\r\ncountries of western Europe ever and anon a cross-current of reaction\r\ntraverses the stream of intellectual evolution: narrow-minded zealots,\r\nhypocritical bigots, false patriots, literary Gibeonites, gossiping\r\nold women arrayed in the mantles of philosophers, do their best to put\r\nfetters on the independent thought of man, to nip the free and natural\r\nintellectual development in the very bud by forcing it under the iron\r\ngrip of tradition and authority. These reactionary tendencies of the\r\nlovers of darkness are only exceptions, and will lead thought for a while\r\ninto a side channel, but cannot stop the triumphant march onwards. Not so\r\nin Russia.\r\n\r\nIn the empire of the czar thought is almost a crime and every means is\r\nemployed to keep it within the boundaries prescribed by the governing\r\npower. To overstep these boundaries, to develop itself freely, and I\r\nmight say naturally, is to declare war against authority, to revolt. The\r\nhistory of evolution of thought in Russia is therefore almost identical\r\nwith the revolutionary movement. If whilst working on the construction\r\nof the temple with the right hand, the left has to wield the sword\r\nagainst a sudden attack of the enemy, the edifice can rise only very\r\nslowly. Renan says (in his _Future of Science_) that the great creations\r\nof thought appear in troublous times and that neither material ease\r\nnor even liberty contributes much to the originality and the energy of\r\nintellectual development. On the contrary the work of mind would only be\r\nseriously threatened if humanity came to be too much at its ease. Thank\r\nGod! exclaims the Breton philosopher, that day is still far distant.\r\nThe customary state of Athens, he continues, was one of terror; the\r\nsecurity of the individual was threatened at every moment, to-day an\r\nexile, to-morrow he was sold as a slave. And yet in such a state Phidias\r\nproduced the Propylæa statues, Plato his dialogues and Aristophanes his\r\nsatires. Dante would never have composed his cantos in an atmosphere of\r\nstudious ease. The sacking of Rome did not disturb the brush of Michael\r\nAngelo. In a word, the most beautiful things are born amid tears and it\r\nis in the midst of struggle, in the atmosphere of sorrow and suffering\r\nthat humanity develops itself, that the human mind displays the most\r\nenergy and activity in all directions. Renan was an individualist,\r\nand aristocratic in his teachings, and seems only to have in view\r\nthe individual, nay the genius. Suffering and oppression, physical,\r\nintellectual and moral, are schools where the strong gather more strength\r\nand come forth triumphant, but where the weaker are destroyed. What is\r\ntrue for the _élite_, for the very limited number of the chosen few, does\r\nnot hold good for humanity at large, which is not strong enough to think\r\nwhen it is hungry, to fight against opposing forces and to hurl down the\r\nbarriers erected against the advance of thought. Few indeed are those who\r\ncan carry on the struggle to a successful issue. The Russian government,\r\nwith its Mongolian traditions of autocracy, threw the great nation, which\r\nremained behind Peter’s forward march, back into complete indifference\r\nand apathy, into a state of submissive contentment, where, like a child,\r\nit kisses the rod that punishes it, sometimes cries like a child, and is\r\nlulled to sleep by the whisperings of mystic superstition and the vapours\r\nof _vodki_.\r\n\r\nHas not the populace a terrifying example in the martyrs of Russian\r\nthought? A terrible destiny awaits him who dares to step beyond the line\r\ntraced by the hand of the government, who ventures to look over the\r\nwall erected by imperial ukase. “The history of Russian thinkers,” says\r\nAlexander Herzen (_Russland’s Sociale Zustände_, page 136), “is a long\r\nlist of martyrs and a register of convicts.” Those whom the hand of the\r\nimperial government has spared died in the prime of youth, before they\r\nhad time to develop, like blossoms hurrying to quit life before they\r\ncould bear fruit. A Pushkin and a Lermontov fell in the prime of youth,\r\none thirty-eight and the other twenty-seven years old, victims of the\r\nunnatural state of society. Russia’s Beaumarchais, Griboiedov, found a\r\npremature end in Persia in his thirty-fifth year; Kolzov, the Russian\r\nBurns, Bielinski, the Russian Lessing, died in misery, the latter at the\r\nage of thirty-eight. Czerncevski was torn from his literary activity\r\nand sent to Siberia. Dobrolubov sang his swan-song in his twenty-fifth\r\nyear. Chaadaev, the friend of Schelling, was declared mad by order of the\r\ngovernment. If such measures have kept the people in a state of ignorance\r\nand still lowered the already low level of civilisation, the autocratic\r\nrule has further, as it was unable to crush it, caused the intelligentia\r\nto turn its thoughts into a certain direction.\r\n\r\nIf we follow the development of the Russian intelligentia we notice at\r\nonce that all the currents of its intellectual life are, at the present\r\ntime at least, converging into one centre, swelling the stream, that\r\nis already running high, to a vast and mighty ocean, which is sending\r\nits waters, through many channels, all over Europe. This centre is\r\nliterature. Since the foundation of the Academy of Science by Peter\r\nthe Great Russian achievements in the domains of science, technical\r\neducation, art, sculpture, music, painting, history and philosophy have\r\nbeen very small.\r\n\r\nIn science and art the Russians have produced nothing of importance,\r\nnothing original. Mendeleev, Lobatshevski, Pirogov, Botkin, Soloviev are\r\na few scientific names of some eminence but they are few as compared\r\nwith Europe and America. Many others, who are known to the western world\r\nas Russians, are in reality Germans or Armenians. The great historian,\r\nKaramzin, was of Tatar extraction. In the domain of art Vereshchagin is a\r\nRussian but Ainasowski is an Armenian, Brulov a Prussian and Antokolski a\r\nJew (cf. Brüggen, _Das heutige Russland_, p. 182).\r\n\r\nRussia has had no Spinoza and no Kant, no Newton and no Spencer. Since\r\nthe foundation of the University of Moscow in 1755, some semblance\r\nof Russian philosophy has appeared but a Soloviev and a Grote, a\r\nTroitski and a Preobrajenski have only introduced the philosophy of\r\nGermany, France, and England into Russia, but not worked out their own\r\nphilosophical systems. Thus, whilst Russian scientists, technicians,\r\nartists and even musicians have to go abroad to complete their education,\r\nRussian philosophers borrow from Hegel or Descartes, from Locke or Comte.\r\nThis is, however, not the case with Russian literature. Russia has\r\nquickened her development in the realm of literature. Her decades were\r\ncenturies. Rapidly she has lived through phases of growth and evolution,\r\nof achievement and reflection which have filled long periods in other\r\npeople’s lives. The peaks of Russian creative power in this domain, the\r\nproductions of Pushkin and Turgeniev, of Lermontov, Dostoievski and\r\nTolstoi proudly face the heights of literary western Europe.\r\n\r\nWhilst, however, the Russian genius of the intelligentia centred its\r\nforce in literature, this literature bears the unmistakable trait, that\r\ndistinguishes it from European literature, of having a tendency to teach\r\nand of taking a moral aspect. Russian literature on the whole has not\r\nentered the sphere of artistic interest, it has always been a pulpit\r\nwhence the word of instruction came forth. With very few exceptions, like\r\nMerejkovski and Andreiev, the Russian author is not practising art for\r\nart’s sake (_l’art pour l’art_) but is pursuing a goal, is accomplishing\r\na task.\r\n\r\nThe Russian literature is a long cry of revolt, a continuous sigh or an\r\nadmonition. Taine says, somewhere, when speaking of Stendhal and Balzac:\r\n“They love art more than men--they are not writing out of sympathy for\r\nthe poor, but out of love for the beautiful.” This is just what the\r\nRussian modern author is not doing. The intellectual and instructive\r\nmoments predominate over the emotional and artistic.\r\n\r\nThis state of the intellectual development is explained by what has been\r\nstated above. It is due to the sudden introduction of western ceremonies\r\nand superficial civilisation, followed by a powerful foreign influence on\r\nthe one hand, and the general social and political state of the country.\r\nWhen Peter had suddenly launched Russia--which was floating like some big\r\nhulk between Asia and Europe--towards the west, the few who helped him in\r\nthis endeavour came under the complete influence of western thought and\r\nmanners. St. Petersburg soon became a Versailles in miniature. Voltaire,\r\nDiderot, and the encyclopædists governed and shaped Russian thought and\r\nRussian society. But not only France--Germany too, and England, Byron\r\nand his individualism, had gained great sway in Russia. The independence\r\nof Russian thought and its intellectual development only dates from\r\nabout 1840. When it awoke at that time, when it became conscious of\r\nitself, it felt that it had a great work, a great mission to fulfil.\r\nSurrounded on one side by a people that was ignorant, ready to sink lower\r\nand lower; opposed, on the other, by a government that did its best to\r\ncheck individualism and independence in every possible way--the Russian\r\nintelligentia felt its great responsibility.\r\n\r\nSurrounded by a population whose mental development was on a very low\r\nlevel, the atmosphere was and still is not propitious for the cultivation\r\nof art or science, whilst the Russian author had no time simply to admire\r\nthe beautiful in nature but was compelled to look round and try what good\r\nhe could do. Thus Russian genius concentrated itself in literature as the\r\nbest vehicle to expose the state of Russian society. The Russian writer\r\nbecame an apostle. He is not anxious to be artistic, to shape his style\r\nand to be fascinating, but to give as true a picture of Russian life as\r\nhe possibly can, to show the evil and to suggest the remedy.\r\n\r\nSuch, in broad lines, is the present state which the few, whom we\r\ntermed the Russian intelligentia, have reached in their intellectual\r\ndevelopment. In a moment of strength the Russian genius has attained\r\nitself, with self-asserting individuality. Its task is great, its\r\nobstacles are manifold, but it fights valiantly and moves on steadily.\r\nThis only applies to the few. When the day of political freedom will dawn\r\nfor Russia, then and then only the great evolution and the intellectual\r\ndevelopment of Russia itself, of the Russian people as a whole, will\r\nbegin. On the day when civil and religious despotism, that everywhere\r\ncrushes individuality, will cease, then the genius of the Russian people\r\nwill spread its pinions, and the masses will awake from their inertia to\r\nnew life, like the gradual unfolding of spring into summer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I. LAND AND PEOPLE AND EARLY HISTORY\r\n\r\n\r\nEXTENT, CONFIGURATION, AND CLIMATE\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [To 1054 A.D.]]\r\n\r\nTo arrive at a just appreciation of Russia’s genius we must have a\r\nknowledge of the soil that nourishes her, the peoples that inhabit her,\r\nand the history through which she has passed. Let us begin with nature,\r\nsoil, and climate.\r\n\r\nThe first fact that strikes us in regard to the Russian empire is its\r\nvastness.[2] Its colossal dimensions are so out of proportion to the\r\nsmallness of the greatest among European states, that, to bring them\r\nwithin the sphere of human imagination, Alexander von Humboldt, one of\r\nthe greatest scientists of his century, makes the statement that the\r\nportion of the globe under Russia’s dominion is greater than the entire\r\nsurface of the moon at its full.\r\n\r\nThe territories of that vast empire acknowledge no limits; its vast\r\nplains stretch toward the heart of the old continent, as far as the huge\r\npeaks of central Asia; they are stopped between the Black and the Caspian\r\nseas by the great wall of the Caucasus, whose foot is planted below the\r\nsea-level, and the height of whose summits exceeds by eight hundred feet\r\nthat of Mont Blanc.\r\n\r\nIn lakes Ladoga and Onega, in the northwest, Russia possesses the\r\ngreatest lakes in Europe; in Lake Baikal, in Siberia, the greatest in\r\nAsia; in the Caspian and Aral seas, the greatest in the world. Her rivers\r\nequal her plains in proportion: the Obi, the Yenisei, the Amur, in Asia;\r\nthe Dnieper, the Don, the Volga, in Europe. The central artery of Russia\r\nis the Volga--a river that, in its winding course of nearly twenty-four\r\nhundred miles, is not altogether European. Nine tenths of the Russian\r\nterritory are as yet nearly empty of inhabitants, and nevertheless the\r\npopulation, according to the census of 1897, taken over all the empire\r\nexcept Finland, numbered 129,000,000; and the annual increase is very\r\nnearly two million.\r\n\r\nEurope is distinguished from other regions of the globe by two\r\ncharacteristics which make her the home of civilisation: her land is\r\ncut into by the seas--“cut into bits,” as Montesquieu says; she is,\r\naccording to Humboldt, “an articulated peninsula”; her other distinctive\r\nadvantage is a temperate climate which, in great measure the result of\r\nher configuration, is duplicated nowhere under the same latitude. Russia\r\nalone, adhering solidly to Asia by her longest dimension, bordered on\r\nthe north and northwest by icy seas which permit to the borders few of\r\nthe advantages of a littoral, is one of the most compact and eminently\r\ncontinental countries of the globe.\r\n\r\nShe is deprived of the even, temperate climate due to Europe’s\r\narticulated structure, and has a continental climate--nearly equally\r\nextreme in the rigour of its winters and the torrid heat of its summers.\r\nHence the mean temperature varies.\r\n\r\nThe isothermal lines extend in summer toward the pole; in winter they\r\nsink southward: so that the greater part of Russia is included in January\r\nin the rigid, in July in the torrid zone. Her very vastness condemns her\r\nto extremes. The bordering seas are too distant or too small to serve\r\nher as reservoirs of warmth or basins of coolness. Nowhere else in the\r\nOccident are to be found winters so long and severe, summers so burning.\r\nRussia is a stranger to the great influences that moderate the climate\r\nof the rest of Europe--the gulf stream and the winds of the Sahara. The\r\nlong Scandinavian peninsula, stretching between Russia and the Atlantic,\r\ndeflects from her coasts the great warm current flowing from the New\r\nWorld to the Old. In place of the gulf stream and the African deserts\r\nit is the polar snows of Europe, and Siberia, the frozen north of Asia,\r\nthat hold the predominating influence over Russia. The Ural range, by its\r\ninsignificant elevation and its perpendicularity to the equator, is but\r\nan inconsiderable barrier to these influences. In vain does Russia extend\r\nsouth into the latitude of Pau and Nice; nowhere this side the Caucasus\r\nwill she find a rampart against the winds of the north. The conformation\r\nof the soil, low and flat, leaves her open to all the atmospheric\r\ncurrents--from the parching breath of the central Asian deserts to the\r\nwinds of the polar region.\r\n\r\nThis lack of mountains and inland seas deprives Russia of the necessary\r\nhumidity brought to the rest of Europe by the Atlantic and laid up for\r\nit in the storehouses of the Alps. The ocean breezes reach her only when\r\nempty of refreshing vapours; those of Asia are wrung dry long before they\r\ntouch her confines. The further the continent stretches, the greater its\r\npoverty of rain. At Kazan the rainfall is but half that of Paris. Hence\r\nthe lack, over an enormous southern region, of the two principal elements\r\nof fertility--warmth and moisture; hence in part those wide, woodless,\r\narid, un-European steppes in the southeast of the empire.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SIMILARITY OF EUROPEAN AND ASIATIC RUSSIA\r\n\r\nOne whole formed of two analogous halves, Russia is in nowise a child\r\nof Europe; but that is not to say that she is Asiatic--that we can\r\nshelve her among the dormant and stationary peoples of the far East.\r\nFar from it: Russia is no more Asiatic than she is European. But in all\r\nphysical essentials of structure, climate, and moisture, she is opposed\r\nto historical, occidental Europe; in all these she is in direct relation\r\nwith the bordering countries of Asia. Europe proper naturally begins at\r\nthe narrowing of the continent between the Baltic and the Black seas.\r\n\r\nIn the southeast there is no natural barrier between Russia and Asia;\r\ntherefore the geographers have in turn taken the Don, the Volga, the\r\nUral, or again the depression of the Obi, as boundaries. Desert steppes\r\nstretch from the centre of the old continent into Russia by the door left\r\nopen between the Ural chain and the Caspian. From the lower course of the\r\nDon to the Aral Sea, all these low steppes on both banks of the Volga and\r\nthe Ural rivers form the bed of an old, dried-up sea, whose borders we\r\ncan still trace, and whose remnants constitute the great salt lakes known\r\nas the Caspian and the Aral seas. By a hydrographical accident which has\r\nhad an enormous influence upon the character and destinies of the people,\r\nit is into one of these closed Asiatic seas that the Volga, the great\r\nartery of Russia, empties, after turning its back upon Europe almost from\r\nits very source.\r\n\r\nTo the north of the Caspian steppes, from latitude 52° to the\r\nuninhabitable polar regions, the longest meridional chain of mountains\r\nof the old continent forms a wall between Russia and Asia. The Russians\r\nin olden days called it the “belt of stone,” or “belt of the world”;\r\nbut, despite the name, the Ural indicates the end of Asia on the one\r\nside, only to mark its recommencement, almost unaltered, on the European\r\nslope. Descending gradually by terraces on the European side, the Ural is\r\nless a chain than a plateau crowned with a line of slight elevations. It\r\npresents principally low ridges covered with forests, like those of the\r\nVosges and the Jura. So greatly depressed is the centre that along the\r\nprincipal passes between Russia and Siberia (from Perm to Iekaterinburg,\r\nfor example) the eye looks in vain for the summits; in constructing a\r\nrailroad through the pass the engineers had no long tunnels to build, no\r\ngreat difficulties to surmount. At this high altitude, where the plains\r\nare snow-bound during six or seven months, no peak attains the limit of\r\neternal snows, no valley enbosoms a glacier.\r\n\r\nIn reality the Ural separates neither the climates, nor the fauna\r\nand flora. Extending almost perpendicularly from north to south, the\r\npolar winds blow almost equally unhindered along both sides; on both,\r\nthe vegetation is the same. It is not till the heart of Siberia is\r\nreached--the upper Yenisei and Lake Baikal--that one finds a different\r\nsoil, a new flora and fauna. The upheaval of the Ural failed to wipe out\r\nthe resemblance and the unity of the two regions it divides. Instead of\r\na wall between the Russias, it is merely a storehouse of mineral wealth.\r\nIn the rocks, of eruptive or metamorphic origin, are veins of metals not\r\nfound in the regular strata of the great plains. It no more separates one\r\nfrom the other than does the river of the same name; and when one day\r\nSiberia shall boast a denser population, the Ural will be regarded as the\r\naxis, the backbone of the two great halves of the empire.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE DUALISM OF NORTH AND SOUTH\r\n\r\nUnity in immensity is Russia’s chief characteristic. From the huge wall\r\nof the Caucasus to the Baltic this empire, in itself greater than all the\r\nrest of Europe, in its numerous provinces presents perhaps less variety\r\nof climate than west European countries whose area is ten or twelve times\r\nless. This is on account of the flat uniformity. And yet, underlying this\r\nhomogeneity of climate and configuration, nature has marked with special\r\ncharacteristics and a distinct individuality a number of regions which,\r\ndivided into two groups, embrace all European Russia. Equally flat, with\r\na climate nearly equally extreme, these two great zones, notwithstanding\r\ntheir similarity, present a remarkable contrast in soil, vegetation,\r\nmoisture, and most other physical and economic conditions. One is the\r\nforest region, the other the woodless zone of the steppes; they divide\r\nthe empire into almost equal halves.\r\n\r\nFrom the opposition, from the natural dualism of the steppe and the\r\nforest, has sprung the historical antagonism and the now-ended strife\r\nbetween the two halves of Russia--the struggle between the sedentary\r\nnorth and the nomad south; between the Russian and the Tatar; between\r\nthe Muscovite state laid in the forest region, and the free Cossacks,\r\nchildren of the steppes. The forest region, though ceaselessly diminished\r\nby cutting, still remains the more extensive. Occupying the entire north\r\nand centre, it grows wider from east to west, from Kazan to Kiev.\r\n\r\nBeyond the polar circle no tree can withstand the intensity and\r\npermanence of the frost. On both sides of the Ural, in the neighbourhood\r\nof Siberia, stretch vast boggy plains (_toundras_), perpetually\r\nfrost-bound, and clothed with moss. In these latitudes no cultivation is\r\npossible, no pasturage but lichens is to be obtained, no animal but the\r\nreindeer can exist. Hunting and fishing are the sole occupations of the\r\nfew inhabitants who make their dwelling in these lands of ice.\r\n\r\nThe soil of the wooded plains, at least in the northwest, from the\r\nWhite Sea to the Niemen and the Dnieper, is low, swampy, and peaty,\r\nintersected by arid sandy hills. The Valdai Hills, the highest plateau,\r\nscarcely attain the height of one thousand feet. This region is rich in\r\nsprings and is the source of all the great rivers. The flatness of the\r\nland prevents the rivers from assuming a distinctly marked course, and\r\nas no ridge intervenes, their waters at the thaw run together and form\r\nenormous swamps; or, travelling slowly down undefined slopes, form at the\r\nbottom vast lakes like the Ladoga, a veritable inland sea, or strings of\r\nwretched little pools, like the eleven hundred lakes in the government of\r\nArchangel.\r\n\r\nThe population, though scattered over wide expanses and averaging less\r\nthan fifteen to the square mile, fails to wring from the unfriendly soil\r\na sufficient nourishment. Wheat will not thrive; barley, rye, and flax\r\nalone flourish. A multitude of small industries eke out the livelihood\r\nfor which agriculture is insufficient.\r\n\r\nThe augmentation of the scattered population is scarcely perceptible\r\nhaving, so to speak, reached the point of saturation. Russia can hope for\r\nan increase of wealth and population in this desolate northland only upon\r\nthe introduction into it of industrial pursuits, as in the case of Moscow\r\nand the Ural regions.\r\n\r\nRussian civilisation finds a great, though by no means insurmountable\r\nobstacle in the extremes of temperature. It must be remembered that\r\nEurope enjoys a temperate climate unparalleled in her fairest colonies,\r\nwhile other continents, for analagous reasons, labour under much the\r\nsame disadvantages as Russia. The climate of the northern portion of the\r\nUnited States greatly resembles that of south Russia, while New York,\r\nPennsylvania, and the New England states pass through the same extremes\r\nof temperature as the steppes of the Black Sea.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SOIL OF THE BLACK LANDS AND THE STEPPES\r\n\r\nThe Black Lands, one of the largest and most fertile agricultural tracts\r\nin the world, occupy the upper part of the woodless zone at its juncture\r\nwith the forest and lake district. Obtaining moisture and shelter\r\nfrom the latter, the Black Lands enjoy much more favourable climatic\r\nconditions than the steppes of the extreme south. They derive their\r\nname (_tchernoziom_) from a stratum of black humus, of an average depth\r\nof from one and a half to five feet, consisting partly of loam, partly\r\nof oily clay mixed with organic substances. It dries rapidly and is\r\nthereupon reduced to a fine dust; but it absorbs moisture with equal\r\npromptitude, and after a rain takes on the appearance of a coal-black\r\npaste. The formation of this wonderfully fertile layer is attributed to\r\nthe slow decomposition of the steppe grasses, accumulated during many\r\ncenturies.\r\n\r\nThe _tchernoziom_ circles like a belt across European Russia, from\r\nPodolia and Kiev on the southwest beyond Kazan in the northeast; after\r\nthe interruption of the Ural ridge it reappears in Siberia in the\r\nsouthern part of Tobolsk. The trees disappear altogether as we advance\r\nsouthwards, till not even a bush is to be seen. Nothing is visible to\r\nthe eye but hundreds of miles of fertile black soil, a limitless field\r\nstretching beyond the horizon. As a consequence of its fertility this\r\nportion of Russia is most populous; the population increases steadily, as\r\nrailways are constructed and as agriculture gains upon the surrounding\r\nsteppes.\r\n\r\nBetween the Black Lands and the southern seas lie the steppes proper\r\nwherein the dead level of the country, the absence of all arboreal\r\nvegetation, and the summer droughts attain their maximum. These great\r\nplains, covering over half a million miles of Europe, include many\r\ndifferent qualities of soil, destined to as many different ends.\r\n\r\nThe sandy, stony, saline steppes will forever be unfit for cultivation.\r\nThe fertile steppes which occupy the greater part of the space between\r\nthe Black Lands and the Black Sea and the sea of Azov consist of a\r\nlayer of black vegetable mould ready for cultivation and teeming with\r\nfertility. The grass, growing five or six feet high, in rainy seasons\r\neven higher, accounts in some measure for the absence of woods: its rapid\r\nluxuriant growth would smother young trees.\r\n\r\nThe virgin steppe with its rank vegetation--the steppe of history and\r\npoetry--diminishes day by day, and will soon disappear before the\r\nagricultural invasion. The legendary Ukraine has almost lost its wild\r\nbeauty; Gogol’s steppe, like Cooper’s prairie, will soon be but a\r\nmemory--lost in the black belt. The long delay in opening up these grassy\r\nplains is due as well to the lack of water and wood as to the lack of\r\nworkers. The lack of water is difficult to remedy, hence the plains\r\nare bound to experience alternately good and bad years; hence, also,\r\nthe frequent famines in lands which otherwise might be regarded as the\r\nstorehouse of the empire.\r\n\r\nPerhaps an even greater drawback is the lack of trees; thereby the\r\npopulation is deprived both of fuel and of materials for building. Stalks\r\nof the tall steppe-grasses and the dung of the flocks, which otherwise\r\nwould go to the soil, supply it with a fuel that would not suffice for a\r\ndense population. The introduction of railroads and the opening of coal\r\nmines will, however, remedy little by little these evils, by supplying\r\nfuel and restoring the manure to the soil. The proximity to the estuaries\r\nof the great rivers and to the Black Sea renders the position of these\r\nsteppes especially favourable to trade with Europe.\r\n\r\nThe Ural-Caspian depression is as truly a desert as the Sahara. It\r\ncontains but few oases. These saline steppes sink in part below the sea\r\nlevel, like the Caspian itself, whose ancient basin they formed, and\r\nwhich now, narrowed and sunk, lies about eighty-five feet below the Black\r\nSea’s surface. This region is of all European Russia the barest, the\r\ndriest, and the most exposed to extreme seasons. It is decidedly Asiatic\r\nin soil, climate, flora, fauna, and inhabitants. This barren steppeland,\r\ncovering three hundred thousand square miles, has less than a million\r\nand a half inhabitants. It is good for nothing but pasturage; and is\r\ntherefore overrun with nomad Asiatic tribes.\r\n\r\nWe cannot consider as Russian in character the Caucasus and the southern\r\ncoast of the Crimea; these present an entirely different aspect, and\r\nare as varied as the real Russia is monotonous. In the valleys of the\r\nCaucasus appear again forests--absent from the centre of the empire\r\nsouthwards--dense and vigorous, not thin and scattered and monotonous as\r\nin the north. Here fruit-trees thrive, and all varieties of plant life\r\nfor which Russia seeks in vain over her wide plains, from the shores of\r\nthe ice-bound north to the Black Sea--the vine, which on the banks of the\r\nDon finds but a precarious existence; the mulberry-tree; the olive. Few\r\nare the fruits that cannot prosper in the hanging gardens of the Crimea\r\nsuspended above the sea, or in Transcaucasia where, not content with\r\nhaving introduced successfully the cultivation of cotton and the sugar\r\ncane, the Russian merchants are anxious to establish tea plantations.\r\n\r\n\r\nDIVERSITY OF RACES\r\n\r\nThe number of diverse races is accounted for by the configuration of\r\nRussia. Lacking defined boundaries to east and west, Russia has been\r\nopen always to invasion--she has been the great highway of emigration\r\nfrom Asia into Europe. The strata of human alluvions have nowhere been\r\nmore numerous, more mingled, more broken or inharmonious than on this\r\nflat bed, where each wave, pushed by the one behind it, encountered no\r\nobstacle other than the wave which had preceded. Even since historical\r\ntimes it is difficult to enumerate the peoples who have followed one\r\nanother upon Russian soil--who have there formed empires more or less\r\ndurable: Scythian, Sarmatian, Goth, Avar, Bulgarian, Hungarian, Chazar,\r\nPetcheneg, Lithuanian, Mongol, Tatar; without counting the previous\r\nmigrations of the Celts and Teutones, or of peoples whose very names\r\nhave perished, but among whom even the most obscure have left upon the\r\npopulation some impression whose origin to-day it is impossible to trace.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: COSTUME WORN BY COSSACK OF THE UKRAINE]\r\n\r\nWhile the configuration of Russia has left her open to every invader,\r\nthe structure of her soil forbade the development of the invaders into\r\norganised nations independent of one another. Instead of being the\r\nconsequence of slow development by physical causes, this multiplicity\r\nof races and tribes is an historical heritage. Without considering the\r\nglacial regions of the north, uninhabitable save for hunters and fishers,\r\nor the sandy and saline steppes of the southeast, where wander only\r\npastoral nomads, this complexity of races and tribes, far from being a\r\nresult of adaptation to the soil--far from being in harmony with physical\r\nconditions, is directly opposed to them. Far from having a tendency to\r\nrace diversion, the natural conditions made for unity and harmony. The\r\nabsence of boundaries made it impossible for the different tribes to\r\nisolate themselves.\r\n\r\nIn the immense quadrilateral comprised between the glacial ocean and\r\nthe Black Sea, between the Baltic and the Ural, there is not a single\r\nmountain--not a single dividing line. Over this even surface the\r\ndifferent tribes have been obliged to scatter at random--just as the\r\nwaters have flowed together, having no ridge to separate them, no banks\r\nto contain them. Thus, while custom, religion, and language prevented\r\ntheir mingling, they were yet obliged to live side by side: to invade\r\none another, to mingle one with another without loss of individuality,\r\nas the rivers which flow together without confounding their waters.\r\nExhausted in the effort to spread over too large expanses, or broken up\r\ninto fragments, all these races have the more easily submitted to the\r\ndomination of one rule; and under this domination they have been the\r\nmore rapidly unified and mingled. From this fusion, begun centuries ago\r\nunder the Christian empire and the Muscovite sovereignty, have sprung the\r\nRussian people--that mass of about 129,000,000 souls, which, compared\r\nwith other peoples, resembles the sea devouring its own shores, a sea\r\ndotted with islands which it swallows one by one.\r\n\r\nOut of the seeming chaos of Russian ethnology emerge definitely three\r\nprincipal elements--Finn, Tatar, and Slav, which last has to-day to a\r\ngreat extent absorbed the other two. Not counting the three millions\r\nof Jews in the west, the seven or eight hundred thousand Rumanians in\r\nBessarabia, the eight or nine hundred thousand Germans of the Baltic\r\nprovinces and the southern colonies; without counting the Kalmucks of the\r\nsteppe of the lower Volga, the Circassians, the Armenians, the Georgians,\r\nand the whole babel of the Caucasus--all the races and tribes which\r\nhave invaded Russia in the past and all which inhabit her to-day can be\r\ntraced to one of these three races. As far back as history goes, are to\r\nbe found upon Russian soil, under one name or another, representatives of\r\nall these three groups; and their fusion is not yet so complete that we\r\ncannot trace their origin, their distinctive characteristics, or their\r\nrespective original dominions.\r\n\r\nThe Finnish tribe seems in olden times to have occupied the most\r\nextensive territory in what is to-day called Russia. It is manifestly\r\nforeign to Aryan or European stock, whence, with the Celts and Latins,\r\nGermans and Slavs, most of the European peoples have sprung. Ethnological\r\nclassifications usually place the Finns in a more or less comprehensive\r\ngroup known variously as Turanian, Mongolian, and Mongoloid.\r\n\r\nThe Mongols, properly so called, with the Tatars are usually arranged\r\nbeside the Finns in the Ural-Altaic group; which, on the other hand,\r\nrejects the Chinese and other great nations of oriental Asia. This\r\nclassification appears to be the most reasonable; but it must be\r\nnoticed that this Ural-Altaic group is far from presenting the same\r\nhomogeneousness as the Aryan or Semitic group. The relationship between\r\nthe numerous branches is far less fundamental than between Latin and\r\nGerman; it is probably far more remote than that between the Brahman or\r\nGheber of India and the Celt of Scotland or Brittany; at bottom it is\r\nperhaps less close than between the Indo-European and the Semite.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Finns_\r\n\r\nThe Finnish race, which outside of Hungary is almost entirely comprised\r\nwithin European Russia, numbers five or six millions, divided into a\r\ndozen different tribes. To the Hungarian family in the north belongs\r\nthe only Finnish people which ever played an important rôle in Europe,\r\nor arrived at a high state of civilisation--the Magyars of Hungary. In\r\nthe northwest we find the Finns properly so called; they are subdivided\r\ninto two or three tribes, the Suomi, as they designate themselves,\r\nconstituting the only tribe in the whole empire that possesses a national\r\nspirit, a love of country, a history, and a literature; also the only one\r\nthat has escaped the slow absorption by which their kindred have been\r\nswallowed up. They form five-sixths of the population of the grand duchy\r\nof Finland--a population almost wholly rural. A Swedish element mingled\r\nwith German and Russian is predominant in the cities.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A TATAR\r\n\r\n(Russian)]\r\n\r\nSt. Petersburg is, truth to tell, built in the midst of Finnish\r\nterritory; the immediate surroundings are russified, and that quite\r\nrecently: even half a century ago Russian was not understood in the\r\nhamlets lying at the very gates of the capital. To this Finnish branch\r\nbelong the Livs, a tribe nearly extinct, which has given its name at\r\nLivonia; also the Lapps--the last, physically the ugliest, morally the\r\nleast developed, of all the branches of this tribe.\r\n\r\nThe race is almost infinitely subdivided; its members profess all the\r\nreligions from Shamanism to Mohammedanism, from Greek orthodoxy to\r\nLutheranism. They are nomadic, like the Lapp; pastoral, like the Bashkir;\r\nsedentary and agricultural like the Esth and the Finn. They have adopted\r\nthe customs and spoken the language of each and all, have been ruled\r\nby peoples of different origins, have been russified after having been\r\npartially tatarised--all these influences contributing to break up\r\nthe race into insignificant fragments. As numerous as their Hungarian\r\nkindred, the Finns of the Russian Empire are far from being able to claim\r\nan equal political significance.\r\n\r\nIs it true that the alliance with the Finns is for Russia an irremediable\r\ncause of inferiority? It is doubtful. In their isolation and disruption,\r\nhampered by the thankless soil upon which they dwell, the Finns have\r\nbeen unable to achieve an original development; as compensation, they\r\nhave everywhere manifested a singular facility of assimilation with\r\nmore developed races with which they have come in contact; they allowed\r\nthemselves easily to be overwhelmed by a civilisation which they\r\nthemselves were unable to originate: if they possessed no blood-ties with\r\nEurope, they placed no obstacles in the way of annexation by her. Their\r\nreligion is the best proof. The majority have long been Christians; and\r\nit is principally Christianity which has led the way to their fusion\r\nwith the Slavs and their assimilation into civilised Europe. From\r\nHungary to the Baltic and the Volga, they have accepted with docility\r\nthe three principal historical forms of Christianity; the most modern,\r\nProtestantism, has thriven better among the Finnish and Esthonic tribes\r\nthan among the Celtic, Iberian, and Latin peoples.\r\n\r\nIf we seek in language an unmistakable sign of race and intelligence,\r\nit must be admitted that certain Finns--the Suomi of Finland like the\r\nMagyars of Hungary--have brought their agglutinated languages to a\r\nperfection which for power, harmony, and wealth of expression well bears\r\ncomparison with our most complex flexional languages. If it is true that\r\nthe Finns are related to the Mongols, they have certainly the virtues of\r\nthat race, which holds its own so well in its struggle with Europe: they\r\npossess the same stability, patience, and perseverance; hence perhaps the\r\nfact that to every country and every state which has felt their influence\r\nthe Finns have communicated a singular power of resistance, a remarkable\r\nvitality.\r\n\r\n\r\nETHNOLOGICAL DISTRIBUTION OF RELIGIONS\r\n\r\nThe Finn has become Christian; the Turk or Tatar, Moslem; the Mongol,\r\nBuddhist: to this ethnological distribution of religion there are few\r\nexceptions. Hereto are attributable the causes of the widely different\r\ndestinies of these three groups--particularly the neighbouring Finns\r\nand Tatars. It is religion which has prepared the one for its European\r\nexistence; it is religion which has made that existence impossible\r\nfor the other. Islam has given the Tatar a higher and more precocious\r\ncivilisation; it has inspired him to build flourishing cities like the\r\nancient Sarai and Kazan, and to found powerful states in Europe and Asia;\r\nit has achieved for him a brilliant past, while exposing him to a future\r\nfull of difficulties: while saving him from absorption into Europe, it\r\nhas left him completely outside the gate of modern civilisation.\r\n\r\nIt is the Tatars who have given to the Russians the name of Mongols, to\r\nwhich the Tatars themselves have but a questionable right. In any case\r\nthe title is not applicable to the true Russians, who have at most but a\r\ndrop or two of Mongol blood in their veins, and less of Tatar than the\r\nSpaniards have of Moorish or Arab.\r\n\r\nAt the same time with the process of absorption and assimilation of the\r\nFinnish element, another process has for centuries been going on--an\r\ninverse process of secretion and elimination of the Tatar and Moslem\r\nelements which Russia found herself unable to assimilate. After their\r\nsubmission a great number of Tatars left Russia, being unwilling to\r\nbecome the subjects of the infidels whose masters they had been. Before\r\nthe progress of Christianity they spontaneously retreated to the lands\r\nstill dominated by the law of the prophet. After the destruction of the\r\nKhanates of Kazan and Astrakhan, they tended to concentrate in the Crimea\r\nand the neighbouring straits--in what up to the eighteenth century was\r\nknown as Little Tartary; after the conquest of the Crimea by Catherine\r\nII they took their way still farther toward the empire of their Turkish\r\nbrethren. Even in our own time, after the war of Sebastopol and after the\r\nconquest of the Caucasus, the emigration of the Tatars and the Nogaians\r\nbegan again on an enormous scale, together with that of the Circassians.\r\nIn the Crimea the Tatar population, already diminished by one-half in the\r\ntime of Catherine II, is to-day scarcely one-fifth of what it was at the\r\ntime of the annexation to Russia. The introduction of obligatory military\r\nservice in the year 1874 drove them out in large numbers. By defeat and\r\nvoluntary exile have the Tatars been reduced to insignificant groups in\r\na country where, formerly, they reigned for centuries--in some parts of\r\nwhich even they were the sole inhabitants.[b]\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SLAVS\r\n\r\nAs to the Slavs, who form the nucleus of the Russian population, it\r\nis now generally recognised that they migrated to Russia from the\r\nneighbourhood of the Carpathian Mountains. The Byzantine annalists of\r\nthe sixth and the beginning of the seventh centuries, speaking of the\r\nSlavs, whom they called Sklaboi, a name appearing as early as the end of\r\nthe fifth century, distinguish two branches of them: the Ants, living\r\nfrom the Danube to the mouth of the Dnieper; and the Slavs, properly\r\nso named, living northeast of the Danube and as far to the east as the\r\nsource of the Vistula, and on the right bank of the Dniester. In this,\r\ntheir statement agrees with that of Jornandes,[l] the historian of the\r\nGoths. Some Russian scholars suppose that before coming to the Danube\r\nthe Slavs lived near the Carpathians, whence they invaded the Byzantine\r\nempire. These encroachments, beginning as far back as the third century,\r\nresulted in the penetration of the Slavs into southern Austria and the\r\nBalkan peninsula. Byzantine annalists of the sixth and seventh centuries,\r\nProcopius and the emperor Maurice, who had to fight the Slavs in person,\r\nspeak of them as being ever on the move: “They live in woods and on\r\nthe banks of rivers, in small hamlets, and are always ready to change\r\ntheir abode.” At the same time these Byzantine annalists describe this\r\npeople as exceedingly fond of liberty. “From the remotest period,”\r\nsays Procopius,[d] “the Slavs were known to live as democracies; they\r\ndiscussed their wants in popular assemblies or folkmotes.” “The Slavs\r\nare fond of liberty,” writes the emperor Maurice[e]; “they cannot bear\r\nunlimited rulers, and are not easily brought to submission.” The same\r\nlanguage is used also by the emperor Leo.[f] “The Slavs,” says he, “are\r\na free people, strongly opposed to any subjection.” If the Byzantine\r\nhistorians do not speak of the invasion of the Slavs into the limits of\r\nthe empire during the second part of the seventh century, it is because\r\ntheir migration took at this time another direction: from the Carpathians\r\nthey moved toward the Vistula and the Dnieper.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A FINNISH COSTUME]\r\n\r\nDuring the ninth century, the time of the founding of the first\r\nprincipalities, the Dnieper, with its numerous affluents on both sides,\r\nformed the limit of the Slavonic settlements to the east. This barrier\r\nwas broken only by the Viatitchi, stretching as far to the northeast as\r\nthe source of the Oka. On the north the Slavs reached the great Valdai\r\nplateau from which Russia’s largest rivers descend, and the southern part\r\nof the great lake region, that of Ilmen.[c]\r\n\r\nThere is no indication that the race is deficient in genius. It was\r\nthe Slavs who opened the way to the west by two great movements which\r\ninaugurated the modern era--the Renaissance and the Reformation; by\r\nthe discovery of the laws that govern the universe, and the plea for\r\nliberty of thought. The Pole Copernicus was the herald of Galileo; the\r\nCzech, John Huss, the precursor of Luther. Poland and Bohemia, the two\r\nSlav peoples most nearly connected with the west by neighbourhood and\r\nreligion, can cite a long list of men distinguished in letters, science,\r\npolitics, and war. Ragusa alone could furnish an entire gallery of men\r\ntalented along all lines. There where remoteness from the west and\r\nforeign oppression have made study impossible and prevented single names\r\nfrom becoming widely known, the people have manifested their genius in\r\nsongs which lack none of the qualities inherent in the most splendid\r\npoetry of the west. In that popular impersonal literature which we admire\r\nso frankly in the _romanceros_ of Spain, the ballads of Scotland and\r\nGermany, the Slav, far from yielding the palm to the Latin or the Teuton,\r\nperhaps excels both. Nothing more truly poetical exists than the _pesmes_\r\nof Servia or the _doumas_ of Little Russia; for, by a sort of natural\r\ncompensation, it is among the Slavs least initiated into western culture\r\nthat popular poetry has flowered most freely.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A WOMAN OF YAKUTSK]\r\n\r\nIn temperament and character the Slavs present an ensemble of defects\r\nand qualities which unite them more nearly with the Latins and Celts\r\nthan with their neighbours the Germans. They are characterised by a\r\nvivacity, a warmth, a mobility, a petulance, an exuberance not always\r\nfound to the same degree among even the peoples of the south. Among the\r\nSlavs of purer blood these characteristics have marked their political\r\nlife with a mobile, inconstant, and anarchical spirit which has rendered\r\nextremely difficult their national existence and which, taken with\r\ntheir geographical position, has been the great obstacle in the way of\r\ntheir civilisation. The distinguishing faculty of the race is a certain\r\nflexibility and elasticity of temperament and character which render it\r\nadaptable to the reception and the reproduction of all sorts of diverse\r\nideas; the imitative faculty of the Slavs is well known. This gift is\r\neverywhere distributed among them; this Slav malleability, peculiar\r\nalike to Pole and Russian, is perhaps fundamentally but a result of\r\ntheir historical progress and of their geographical position. But lately\r\nentered in at the gate of civilisation, and during long years inferior to\r\nthe neighbouring races, they have always gone to school to the others;\r\ninstead of living by their own invention, they have lived by borrowing,\r\nand the imitative spirit has become their ruling faculty, having been for\r\nthem the most useful as well as the most widely exercised.\r\n\r\nIn the west the Slavs fell under the influence of Rome; in the east,\r\nunder that of Byzantium: hence the antagonism which during long centuries\r\nhas set strife in the midst of the two chief Slavonic nations. United\r\nby their common origin and the affinity of their languages, they are,\r\nhowever, separated by the very elements of civilisation--religion,\r\nwriting, and calendar; therein lies the secret of the moral and material\r\nstrife between Russia and Poland--a strife which, after having nearly\r\nannihilated the one, actually cost the other its life; as though from the\r\nCarpathian to the Ural, on those vast even plains, there was not room at\r\none time for two separate states.\r\n\r\nIn the northwest, on the banks of the Niemen and Dvina, appears a strange\r\ngroup, incontestably of Indo-European origin yet isolated amidst the\r\npeoples of Europe; harking back to the Slavs, yet forming a parallel\r\nbranch rather than offshoot--the Letto-Lithuanian group. Shut away\r\nin the north by marshy forests, restricted by powerful neighbours,\r\nthe Lithuanian group long remained closed to all outer influences,\r\nwhether of East or West. Last of all the peoples of Europe to accept\r\nChristianity, its language even to-day is the nearest of European tongues\r\nto the Sanskrit. The bone of contention among the Germans, the Poles,\r\nand the Russians, who each in turn obtained a footing among them and\r\nleft an influence on their religion, they found themselves divided into\r\nProtestants, Catholics, and Orthodox.\r\n\r\nMixed with Poles and Russians, menaced on both sides with complete\r\nabsorption, the Lithuanians and the Samogitians, their brothers by race\r\nand language, still number in ancient Lithuania nearly two million souls,\r\nCatholics for the most part; they formed the majority of the population\r\nof Vilna and Kovno. In Prussia some two hundred thousand Lithuanians\r\nconstitute the representatives of the ancient population of oriental\r\nPrussia, whose name is derived from a people of that race which kept its\r\nlanguage intact up to the seventeenth century.\r\n\r\nThe second existing group of this family, the Letts, crossed probably\r\nwith Finns, number more than a million souls; they inhabit chiefly\r\nCourland, Vitetesk and Livonia; but, converted, subjected, and made\r\nslaves of by the Teutonic knights, they still live under the dominion of\r\nthe German barons of the Baltic provinces, with whom they have nothing in\r\ncommon but their religion--Lutheranism. Like the Finnish tribes outside\r\nof Finland, the Letts and Lithuanians, scanty in number and widely\r\nscattered, are incapable of forming by themselves a nation or a state.\r\nOut of this intermixture of races by the assimilation of the ruder by\r\nthe more civilised, was formed a new people--a homogeneous nation. In\r\nfact, contrary to popular prejudice there is in Russia something more\r\nthan an intermixture of diverse races--there is what we to-day call a\r\n“nationality”--as united, as compact, and as self-conscious as any nation\r\nin the world. Russia, notwithstanding all her various races, is yet no\r\nincoherent mass, no political conglomeration or mosaic of peoples. She\r\nresembles France in her national unity rather than Turkey or Austria.\r\n\r\nIf Russia must be compared to a mosaic, let it be to one of those ancient\r\npavements whose scheme is a single substance of solid color edged with\r\na border of diverse forms and shades--most of Russia’s original alien\r\npopulations being relegated to her borders and forming around her a sort\r\nof belt of uneven width.\r\n\r\nIt is in the centre of Russia that is found that uniformity of much more\r\nmarked among the Russians than among all other peoples of Europe; from\r\none end of the empire to the other the language presents fewer dialects\r\nand less localisms than most of our western languages. The cities all\r\nlook alike; the peasants have the same customs, the same manner of life.\r\nThe nation resembles the country, having the same unity, almost the same\r\nmonotony as the plains which it peoples.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Great Russians and the Little Russians_\r\n\r\nThere are, however, two principal types, almost two peoples, speaking\r\ntwo dialects and wholly separated from each other: the Great Russians\r\nand the Little Russians. In their qualities and in their defects they\r\nrepresent in Russia the eternal contrast of north and south. Their\r\nhistory is no less diversified than their nature; the first have their\r\ncentre at Moscow, the second at Kiev. Stretching, the one to the\r\nnortheast, the other to the southwest, these two unequal halves of the\r\nnation do not precisely correspond to the two great physical zones of\r\nRussia. This is due partly to nature, partly to history, which has\r\nhindered the development of the one and fostered that of the other. The\r\nsouthern steppes, open to every invasion, long arrested the expansion\r\nof the Little Russians, who for centuries were shut up in the basins of\r\nthe Dnieper, the Bug, and the Dniester; while the Great Russians spread\r\nfreely in the north and east and established themselves in the enormous\r\nbasin of the Volga; masters of nearly all the forest regions and of the\r\ngreat Ural Lake, they took possession of the Black Belt and the steppes\r\nalong the Volga and the Don.\r\n\r\nThe White Russian inhabits Mohilev, Vitebsk, Grodno, Minsk--a region\r\npossessing some of the finest forests in Russia, but whose soil is marshy\r\nand unwholesome. United politically with the Little Russian, the two have\r\nbeen classed under the name Western Russians. Subjected at an early date\r\nby Lithuania, whose dialect became its official language, White Russia\r\nwas with the greater part of Little Russia united to Poland, and was for\r\ncenturies the object of strife between that nation and the Muscovite\r\nczars, from the effects of which strife she still bleeds. Of the three\r\nRussian tribes this is perhaps the purest in blood; but thanks to the\r\nsterility of the soil and the remoteness of the sea, she has remained the\r\npoorest and least advanced in civilisation.\r\n\r\nThe Great Russians are the most vigorous and expansive element of the\r\nRussian nation, albeit the most mixed. Finnish blood has left its traces\r\nin their physique; Tatar dominion in their character. Before the advent\r\nof the Romanovs they formed alone the Muscovite Empire, and their czars\r\ntook the title “Sovereign of all the Russias” long before Alexis,\r\nfather of Peter the Great, justified this title by the annexation of\r\nthe Ukraine. Hence Great Russia, under the name Muscovite, has been\r\nconsidered by certain foreigners the true, the only Russia. This is\r\nan error; since the Great Russian, the product of the colonisation of\r\ncentral Russia by the western Russians before the invasion of the Tatars\r\nantidates the state and even the village of Moscow. If, therefrom has\r\nemerged the Muscovite autocracy, it is impossible to cut the ties that\r\nbind it to the great Slav republic of the world whose name is still the\r\nactive symbol of liberty--Novgorod.\r\n\r\nLeast Slav of all the peoples that pretend to the name, the Great\r\nRussian has been the coloniser of the race. His whole history has been\r\none long struggle against Asia; his conquests have contributed to the\r\naggrandisement of Europe. Long the vassal of the Tatar khans, he never\r\nforgot under Asiatic domination his European origin; and in the farthest\r\nlimits of Muscovy the very name Asiatic is an insult to the peasant.\r\n\r\nConqueror over Asia, influenced morally and physically by all the\r\npopulations assimilated or subjugated by him in his march from\r\nthe Dnieper to the Ural, the Great Russian lost something of his\r\nindependence, his pride, his individuality; but he gained in stability\r\nand solidity.\r\n\r\nIn spite of the obvious evidences of his mixed blood, the Great\r\nRussian is in perfect harmony with the Caucasian race by the exterior\r\ncharacteristics which distinguish it--his stature, his complexion, the\r\ncolour of his hair and eyes. He is apt to be tall, his skin is white,\r\nhis eyes are very often blue; his hair is usually blond, light chestnut,\r\nor red. The long heavy beard so dear to the heart of the moujik and which\r\nall the persecutions of Peter the Great failed to induce him to dispense\r\nwith, is in itself a mark of race, as nothing could be smoother than the\r\nchin of the Mongol, the Chinese, or the Japanese.\r\n\r\nThe Little Russians dwelling in the south have brown or dark chestnut\r\nhair, and are of purer race, dwelling nearer to the Occident; they pride\r\nthemselves upon their comparatively unmixed blood, their more temperate\r\nclimate, their less dreary land; they are a more imaginative, more\r\ndreamy, more poetic people than their neighbours of the north. It is in\r\nLittle Russia that the Zaparogians belong, the most celebrated of those\r\nCossack tribes which in the Ukraine or the southern steppes played so\r\nimportant a rôle between the Poles, the Tatars, and the Turks, and whose\r\nname will ever remain in Russia the synonym of freedom and independence.\r\nEven to-day the Zaparogian, with his liberal or democratic tradition,\r\nremains the more or less conscious and avowed ideal of the majority of\r\nthe Little Russians. Another reason, in the history of the Ukraine, which\r\nmakes for democratic instincts in the Little Russians is the foreign\r\norigin and denaturalisation of a great part of the higher classes among\r\nthe Poles and Great Russians. From this double motive the Little Russian\r\nis perhaps more susceptible to political aspirations, more accessible to\r\nrevolutionary seduction than his brother of Great Russia.\r\n\r\nOf the Cossacks of to-day only those of the Black Sea transplanted to the\r\nKuban between the sea of Azov and the Caucasus are Little Russians; the\r\nCossacks of the Don and the Ural are Great Russians.[b]\r\n\r\n\r\nSOCIAL AND POLITICAL ORGANISATION\r\n\r\nIt is extremely difficult to draw an approximately correct picture of the\r\nlife of the Russian Slavs even in its barest outlines. Among the widely\r\nscattered tribes there was hardly more than one element tending towards\r\nunion--that of language. Frequent contact with the populations living on\r\ntheir borders and wedged in between them, must of itself have produced\r\nconsiderable modifications in their mode of life.\r\n\r\nThe entire social organisation of the early Slavs, like that of all\r\nother Aryan and non-Aryan peoples, was based upon kinship or descent\r\nfrom a common ancestor.[a] Even in the Varangian period we can discover\r\ntraces of this primeval organisation in clans among a few tribes. In\r\ntime of peace these clans were in the habit of meeting together in order\r\nto discuss common affairs. The chronicler[h] uses the expression “came\r\ntogether” when he wants to speak of decisions taken in common. This\r\npractice seems to have been known to all Slavonic peoples. Among the\r\nRussian Slavs these folkmotes were known under the name of _vetché_,\r\nand they remained to the end of their existence a necessary part of the\r\npolitical institutions, not only in the northern city republics, Novgorod\r\nand Pskov, but also in nearly all the principalities of Russia, with the\r\nexception of one of the latest founded, Moscow.\r\n\r\nAmong these tribes we also find native princes or clan chieftains\r\n(_kniaz_), and it is also certain that as early as the ninth century\r\nthere were among the Russian Slavs private owners of tracts of land who\r\noccupied an advantageous position as compared with the great bulk of the\r\nmembers of the community, and from whom the latter nobles (_boyars_) were\r\ndescended. But on the whole the village community formed the nucleus\r\nof the entire political and economic organisation of the eastern or\r\nRussian Slavs. It was a world complete in itself, self-sufficient and\r\nindependent both economically and juridically. The community was the\r\npossessor of the soil, which was periodically redistributed among its\r\ncomponent members; the separate patriarchal families, and the assembly\r\nof the heads of the families was the body that judged and decided all\r\nthings pertaining to the community. It is thus that we are to understand\r\nthe apparently contradictory reports of the Byzantine writers, who say,\r\non the one hand, that the Slavs know of no government and do not obey any\r\nindividual, and on the other hand speak of a popular government that has\r\nexisted from ancient times, that discusses all things in common, and that\r\nhas many petty princes at its head.\r\n\r\nIt is self-evident that a government adapted to the requirements of\r\na village community must assume a different character as soon as the\r\nsettlement gains in extent and assumes the character of a city. And\r\ncities grew up quite early in northern and southwestern Russia. Toward\r\nthe end of the ninth century Kiev had a wide fame as a large and populous\r\ncity. Constantine Porphyrogenitus also knows of Novgorod, Smolensk,\r\nLinbetch, Tchernigov, Vishgorod, and Vititchev; in the time of Igor more\r\nthan twenty cities can be named. The question as to the origin of Russian\r\ncities has called forth much debate and an extensive literature.\r\n\r\nThe chief difficulty lies in a proper understanding of the so-called\r\nBavarian geographer, a writer of the ninth or tenth century, who counts,\r\nin his description of the northern Slavs, some twenty peoples with more\r\nthan 3,760 cities. These latter he calls now _civitates_, now _urbes_,\r\nwithout indicating that there is any distinction of meaning to be\r\nattached to these terms, so that we are left to conclude that both names\r\ndenote settlements. The present consensus of opinion as to those old\r\nRussian cities is as follows:\r\n\r\nThe old word _grad_, (now _gorod_, city) denoted any space surrounded by\r\na palisade or earthworks. Thus there were wooden and earthen cities built\r\nfor protection in time of war, and every community had its city. But in\r\nthe regions that offered a natural protection by their inaccessible and\r\nswampy character the need for these cities was not so urgent, so that the\r\nwooded and marshy north had fewer cities than the open south. Numerous\r\nremains of these ancient earth piles enable us to recognise the position\r\nand wide extension of these old Slavonic settlements. Sometimes they are\r\ncircular in form, others consist of a double angular trench with outlying\r\nearthworks. These are to be distinguished from the wooden cities, which\r\nwere originally built for trading purposes, and only later were fenced\r\nin and enclosed, so that they could also serve for protective purposes.\r\nThey were built in favourable situations, adjacent to some trade route.\r\nThe more complex social relations that grew up in them demanded a more\r\nthorough organisation of social and political life, for which the village\r\ncommunity did indeed furnish the basis, but which, in the long run, was\r\nfound to be inadequate. The questions of general interest to the city\r\nwere settled in the first place by the vetché, which greatly resembled\r\nthe village gathering of the family elders.\r\n\r\nBut the need of a power which should decide all questions that might\r\narise while the vetché was in abeyance, was more pressing in the cities,\r\nand favoured the development of the power--originally very limited,--of\r\nthe _kniazes_ or princes, who were elective and whose dignity was neither\r\nhereditary nor lifelong. The prince did not even have a permanent\r\nmilitary following: his dignity was of a purely personal nature. It\r\nis certain that not he but the vetché had the power to make laws. Our\r\ninformation concerning the political organisation of the earliest\r\nperiod of Russian history is very scanty, and we know more of what it\r\nlacked than of what it possessed. What strikes us most is the absence\r\nof a military organisation. In times of danger, those who could defend\r\nthemselves took up arms, the remainder fled to places of safety.\r\n\r\nNor can we discern with certainty any social differentiation into\r\nclasses. On the other hand we know that a thriving trade was being\r\ncarried on in the ninth century along the route which led from the gulf\r\nof Finland through Lake Ilmen to the Dvina and down the Dnieper to the\r\nBlack Sea and thence to Greece. The oldest wooden cities lay along the\r\nfamous route of the Varangians to the Greek Empire, along which amidst\r\nmany dangers, the raw products of the north were exchanged for the\r\nfinished commodities of the south. It is owing to these dangers that\r\nthe trader had also to be a warrior, and it is into those ancient trade\r\nrelations--peaceful intercourse enforced by warlike means--that we are to\r\nlook for the most important arms of the old Russian state. Who discovered\r\nthis trade route? We see no compelling reason to deny the honour to the\r\nSlavs, although it is established beyond doubt that even before the\r\nmiddle of the ninth century the Northmen reached Byzantium along this\r\nroute. On the other hand, the marauding and trading expeditions which\r\nwere carried on by Russians in the tenth century and earlier to the sea\r\nof Azov, the Caspian, and further still to the Caucasus and the shores of\r\nPersia, emanated from Scandinavians, and not from Slavs.\r\n\r\n\r\nRELIGION\r\n\r\n[Illustration: NATIVE OF YAKUTSK]\r\n\r\nThe religious conceptions of the Russian Slavs were but little developed.\r\nAll other Aryan peoples, including the western Slavs, excel them in\r\nthis respect. There was neither a distinct priestly class, nor were\r\nthere images of the gods, nor were there distinct types of gods. The\r\nArabian travellers almost unanimously ascribe sun worship to the eastern\r\nSlavs, and Byzantine writers before the ninth century tell of a belief\r\nin a supreme being who rules the universe. It is now generally accepted\r\nthat this supreme god was called Svarog and was a personification of\r\nheaven and light, while sun and fire were regarded as his children.\r\nPerun, the thunder god, and Veles, god of herds, both mentioned by the\r\noldest chronicler, must be brought in relation to the sun. But it is\r\nhighly probable that these two gods were taken over by the Slavs from\r\ntheir Varangian rulers. Water also was regarded as sacred, and, like\r\nthe forest, it was filled with animate beings which must be propitiated\r\nwith sacrifices, since they had relations to human beings. Water, fire,\r\nand earth were related to death. The _russalki_, shades of the dead,\r\nswam about in the water, and the bodies of the dead were given up to the\r\nflames in order to make easier their passage to the realm of the dead\r\n(_rai_). The slaves, as well as the wife and the domestic animals were\r\nburned on the funeral pyre, and cremation was preceded by a feast and\r\ngames in honour of the dead. But burial also was common.[g]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [862 A.D.]]\r\n\r\nWe find the Russian Slavs about the middle of the ninth century split\r\nup into numerous tribes, settled on the soil and engaged chiefly in\r\nhunting and agriculture. A continental people, everywhere confining\r\nitself to the inland country, leaving the sea-borders to non-Slavonic\r\ntribes. Politically they were in the midst of the transition from\r\nthe clan organisation to the village community, without any central\r\nauthority, without any military organisation, and but little able to\r\nresist the inroads from north, south, and east, of populations who lived\r\nby plunder.[a] The primitive condition of their political organisation,\r\ntheir extreme subdivision into tribes and cantons, the endless warfare of\r\ncanton with canton, delivered them up defenceless to every invader. While\r\nthe Slavs of the south paid tribute to the Chazars, the Slavs of Ilmen,\r\nexhausted by internecine conflicts, decided to call in the Varangians.\r\n“Let us seek,” they said, “a prince who will govern us and reason with us\r\njustly. Then,” continues Nestor,[h] “the Tchud, the Slavs (of Novgorod),\r\nthe Krivitchi, and other confederate tribes said to the Varangian\r\nprinces: ‘Our land is great and has everything in abundance, but it lacks\r\norder and justice; come and take possession and rule over us.’”\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE VARANGIAN PERIOD (862-1054 A.D.)\r\n\r\nTo the elements that have obtained a permanent foothold on the soil of\r\nmodern Russia and affected the Slavs in a greater or less degree, a new\r\none must now be added in the Varango-Russians. The brave inhabitants of\r\nSweden and Norway, who were known in western Europe under the name if\r\nNorthman or Normans, directed their first warlike expeditions against\r\ntheir Slavonian and Finnish neighbours. The flotillas of the vikings\r\nwere directed to the shores of the Baltic, and _austrvegr_--the eastern\r\nroute--was the name they gave to the journey into the country of the\r\nFinns and Slavs on the gulf of Finland and further inland. _Gardar_\r\nwas the name they gave to the Slavo-Finnish settlements, _Holmgardar_\r\nwas their name for Novgorod, _Kaenungardar_ for Kiev. _Mikligardar_,\r\nfor Constantinople, shows that the Normans first learned to know that\r\ncity through the eastern Slavs. The Slavs, on the other hand, called\r\nthose Scandinavians by a name given to them by the Finns--Rus. The\r\nScandinavians who sent their surplus of fighting men to Russia and were\r\ndestined to found the Russian state, lived--as we learn from the form\r\nof the names that have come down to us--in Upland, Södermanland, and\r\nÖstergötland, that is, on the east coast of Sweden north of Lake Mälar.\r\nIn these lands and throughout the Scandinavian north, men who were bound\r\nto military chiefs by a vow of fidelity were called _vaeringr_ (pl.\r\n_vaeringjar_, O. Sw. Warung), a name changed by the eastern Slavs into\r\n_variag_. It was these Russo-Varangians who founded the state of Old\r\nRussia.[g]\r\n\r\nAt the call of the Slavs of Novgorod and their allies, three Varangian\r\nbrothers, Rurik, Sineus, and Truvor (Scand. Hrurekr, Sikniutr,\r\nThorwardr), gathered together their kindred and armed followers, or\r\n_drujina_, and established themselves on the northern frontiers of the\r\nSlavs: Sineus to the northeast, on the White Lake; Rurik, the eldest, in\r\nthe centre, on Lake Ladoga near the Volkhov River, where he founded the\r\ncity of Ladoga; and Truvor to the northwest, at Izborsk, near Lake Pskov.\r\nThe year 862 is usually assigned as the date in which the Varangians\r\nsettled in Russia, and it is the official year for the founding of the\r\nRussian empire; but it is more probable that they had come before that\r\ndate.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [865-907 A.D.]]\r\n\r\nShortly after their settlement the two younger brothers died and Rurik\r\nbecame sole chief of all the Varangian bands in northern Russia and\r\nassumed the title of grand-prince. He now became so powerful that he\r\nwas able to subject Novgorod, which he made the capital of an empire\r\nstretching from the lakes in the north to the sources of the Dnieper in\r\nthe south.[a] The country drained by that river was also occupied by\r\nVarangians, but independently of Rurik. Two chiefs by the name of Askold\r\nand Dir (Scand. Höskaldr and Dyri) wrested Kiev from the Chazars and\r\nruled over the Polians, the most civilized tribe of the eastern Slavs. In\r\n865 they led against Byzantium an expedition which consisted of at least\r\ntwo hundred ships, and according to Venetian accounts of three hundred\r\nand sixty ships, to which would correspond an army of about fourteen\r\nthousand warriors. A tempest arose and destroyed the fleet in the sea of\r\nMarmora. The barbarians attributed their disaster to the wonder-working\r\nvirgin, and it is reported that Askold embraced Christianity. This\r\nexpedition has a two-fold importance: (1) it gives us the _first_ certain\r\ndate in Russian history; and (2) it introduced the seeds of Christianity\r\ninto Russia. In the following year, 866, the patriarch Photius\r\nestablished a bishopric at Kiev.\r\n\r\nAfter the death of his brothers Rurik reigned till his death in 879, when\r\nhe was succeeded, not by his son Igor (Scand. Ingvarr), but by the eldest\r\nmember of his family Oleg (Scand. Helge). In 882 he set out from Novgorod\r\nwith an army composed of Varangians and the subject Slavo-Finnish\r\ntribes--Tchuds, Merians, Vesians, Ilmen Slavs, and Krivitchi--sailed down\r\nthe upper Dnieper, took Smolensk, freed the Radimichi and the Severians\r\nfrom the yoke of the Chazars and incorporated them in his empire, and\r\nfinally reached Kiev. Askold and Dir were then got rid of by an act of\r\ntreachery, and Kiev was made the capital of an empire embracing nearly\r\nall the eastern Slavs.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Treaty with Constantinople_\r\n\r\nBut Kiev was only one of the stages in the southward progress of\r\nthe Varangians. The great city of the east, Constantinople, was the\r\nglittering prize that dazzled their eyes and was ever regarded as the\r\ngoal of their ambition. Accordingly, in 907, Oleg sailed with a fleet\r\nof two thousand boats and eighty thousand men, and reached the gates of\r\nConstantinople. The frightened emperor was obliged to pay a large ransom\r\nfor the city and to agree to a treaty of free commercial intercourse\r\nbetween the Russians and the Greeks. A particular district in the suburbs\r\nof the city was assigned as the place of residence for Russian traders,\r\nbut the city itself could be visited by no more than fifty Russians\r\nsimultaneously, who were to be unarmed and accompanied by an imperial\r\nofficer.[g][a]\r\n\r\nOleg’s Varangian guard, who seem to have been also his council, were\r\nparties with him to this treaty, for their assent appears to have been\r\nrequisite to give validity to an agreement affecting the amount of their\r\ngains as conquerors. These warriors swore to the treaty by their gods\r\nPerun and Volos, and by their arms, placed before them on the ground:\r\ntheir shields, their rings, their naked swords, the things they loved and\r\nhonoured most. The gorged barbarian then departed with his rich booty\r\nto Kiev, to enjoy there an uncontested authority, and the title of Wise\r\nMan or Magician, unanimously conferred upon him by the admiration of his\r\nSlavonic subjects.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The First Written Document of Russian History (911 A.D.)_\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [911-913 A.D.]]\r\n\r\nThree years after this event, in 911, Oleg sent ambassadors to\r\nConstantinople to renew the treaty of alliance and commerce between the\r\ntwo empires. This treaty, preserved in the old chronicle of Nestor, is\r\nthe first written monument of Russian history, for all previous treaties\r\nwere verbal. It is of value, as presenting to us some customs of the\r\ntimes in which it was negotiated.\r\n\r\nHere follow some of the articles that were signed by the sovereigns of\r\nConstantinople and of Kiev respectively:\r\n\r\nII. “If a Greek commit any outrage on a Russian, or a Russian on a Greek,\r\nand it be not sufficiently proved, the oath of the accuser shall be\r\ntaken, and justice be done.\r\n\r\nIII. “If a Russian kill a Christian, or a Christian kill a Russian,\r\nthe assassin shall be put to death on the very spot where the crime\r\nwas committed. If the murderer take to flight and be domiciliated, the\r\nportion of his fortune, which belongs to him according to law, shall be\r\nadjudged to the next of kin to the deceased; and the wife of the murderer\r\nshall obtain the other portion of the estate which, by law, should belong\r\nto him.\r\n\r\nIV. “He who strikes another with a sword, or with any other weapon, shall\r\npay three litres of gold, according to the Russian law. If he have not\r\nthat sum, and he affirms it upon oath, he shall give the party injured\r\nall he has, to the garment he has on.\r\n\r\nV. “If a Russian commit a theft on a Greek, or a Greek on a Russian, and\r\nhe be taken in the act and killed by the proprietor, no pursuit shall be\r\nhad for avenging his death. But if the proprietor can seize him, bind\r\nhim, and bring him to the judge, he shall take back the things stolen,\r\nand the thief shall pay him the triple of their value.\r\n\r\nX. “If a Russian in the service of the emperor, or travelling in the\r\ndominions of that prince, shall happen to die without having disposed of\r\nhis goods, and has none of his near relations about him, his property\r\nshall be sent to Russia to his heirs; and, if he have bequeathed them by\r\ntestament, they shall be in like manner remitted to the legatee.”\r\n\r\nThe names of Oleg’s ambassadors who negotiated this treaty of peace,\r\nshow that all of them were Northmen. From this we may conclude that\r\nthe government of the country was as yet wholly in the hands of the\r\nconquerors.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE REIGN OF IGOR\r\n\r\nIgor, the son of Rurik, who was married to a Scandinavian princess named\r\nOlga (Helga), was nearly forty years of age when he succeeded Oleg in\r\n913. He ascended the throne under trying circumstance, for the death\r\nof the victor revived the courage of the vanquished and the Drevlians\r\nraised the standard of revolt against Kiev; but Igor soon quelled them,\r\nand punished them by augmenting their tribute. The Uglitches, who dwelt\r\non the southern side of the Dnieper, contended longer for their liberty\r\nagainst the voyevod Sveneld, whom Igor had despatched against them. One\r\nof their principal towns held out a siege of three years. At last they\r\ntoo were subdued and made tributary.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile new enemies, formidable from their numbers and their thirst\r\nfor pillage, showed themselves on the frontiers of Russia: these were\r\nthe Petchenegs, famous in the Russian, Byzantine, and Hungarian annals,\r\nfrom the tenth to the twelfth century. They were a nomad people, of\r\nthe Turcoman stock, whose only wealth consisted in their lances, bows\r\nand arrows, their flocks and herds, and their swift horses, which they\r\nmanaged with astonishing address. The only objects of their desires were\r\nfat pastures for their cattle, and rich neighbours to plunder. Having\r\ncome from the east they established themselves along the northern shores\r\nof the Black Sea. Thenceforth occupying the ground between the Greek and\r\nthe Russian empires, subsidised by the one for its defence, and courted\r\nby the other from commercial motives--for the cataracts of the Dnieper\r\nand the mouths of the Danube were in the hands of those marauders--the\r\nPetchenegs were enabled for more than two hundred years to indulge their\r\nruling propensity at the expense of their neighbours. Having concluded a\r\ntreaty with Igor, they remained for five years without molesting Russia;\r\nat least Nestor does not speak of any war with them until 920, nor had\r\ntradition afforded him any clue to the result of that campaign.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [920-944 A.D.]]\r\n\r\nThe reign of Igor was hardly distinguished by any important event until\r\nthe year 941, when, in imitation of his guardian, he engaged in an\r\nexpedition against Constantinople. If the chroniclers do not exaggerate,\r\nIgor entered the Black Sea with ten thousand barks, each carrying forty\r\nmen. The imperial troops being at a distance, he had time to overrun\r\nand ravage Paphlagonia, Pontus, and Bithynia. Nestor speaks with deep\r\nabhorrence of the ferocity displayed by the Russians on this occasion;\r\nnothing to which they could apply fire or sword escaped their wanton\r\nlust of destruction, and their prisoners were invariably massacred in\r\nthe most atrocious manner--crucified, impaled, cut to pieces, buried\r\nalive, or tied to stakes to serve as butts for the archers. At last the\r\nGreek fleet encountered the Russian as it rode at anchor near Pharos,\r\nprepared for battle and confident of victory. But the terrible Greek fire\r\nlaunched against the invaders struck them with such dismay that they fled\r\nin disorder to the coasts of Asia Minor. Descending there to pillage,\r\nthey were again routed by the land forces, and escaped by night in their\r\nbarks, to lose many of them in another severe naval defeat. By the\r\nconfession of the Russian chronicles, Igor scarcely took back with him a\r\nthird part of his army.\r\n\r\nInstead of being discouraged by these disasters, Igor prepared to revenge\r\nthem. In 944 he collected new forces [which included a large number of\r\nScandinavians collected for this special purpose by Igor’s recruiting\r\nagents], took the Petchenegs into his pay, exacting hostages for their\r\nfidelity, and again set out for Greece. But scarcely had he reached the\r\nmouths of the Danube when he was met by ambassadors from the emperor\r\nRomanus, with an offer to pay him the same tribute as had been exacted\r\nby Oleg. Igor halted and communicated this offer to his chief men, whose\r\nopinions on the matter are thus reported by Nestor: “If Cæsar makes\r\nsuch proposals,” said they, “is it not better to get gold, silver, and\r\nprecious stuffs, without fighting? Can we tell who will be the victor,\r\nand who the vanquished? And can we guess what may befall us at sea? It is\r\nnot solid ground that is under our feet, but the depths of the waters,\r\nwhere all men run the same risks.”\r\n\r\nIn accordance with these views Igor granted peace to the empire on the\r\nproposed conditions, and the following year he concluded with the emperor\r\na treaty, which was in part a renewal of that made by Oleg.[3] Of the\r\nfifty names attached on the part of Russia to this second treaty, three\r\nare Slavonic, the rest Norman.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [948 A.D.]]\r\n\r\nIgor, being now advanced in years, was naturally desirous of repose, but\r\nthe insatiable cupidity of his comrades in arms forced him to go to war.\r\nFrom the complaints of his warriors it appears that the Russian, like\r\nthe German princes, furnished their faithful band with clothing, arms,\r\nhorses, and provisions. “We are naked,” Igor’s companions and guards said\r\nto him, “while the companions of Sveneld have beautiful arms and fine\r\nclothing. Come with us and levy contributions, that we may be in plenty\r\nwith thee.” It was customary with the grand prince to leave Kiev every\r\nyear, in November, with an army, and not to return until April, after\r\nhaving visited his cities and received their tributes. When the prince’s\r\nmagazine was empty, and the annual contributions were not sufficient,\r\nit became necessary to find new enemies to subject to exactions, or to\r\ntreat as enemies the tribes that had submitted. To the latter expedient\r\nIgor now resorted against the Drevlians. Marching into their country\r\nhe surcharged them with onerous tributes, besides suffering his guards\r\nto plunder them with impunity. His easy success in this rapacious\r\nforay tempted him to his destruction. After quitting the country of\r\nhis oppressed tributaries, the thought struck him that more might yet\r\nbe squeezed out of them. With this view he sent on his army to Kiev,\r\nprobably because he did not wish to let his voyevods or lieutenants share\r\nthe fruit of his contemplated extortions, and went back with a small\r\nforce among the Drevlians, who, driven to extremity, massacred him and\r\nthe whole of his guard near their town of Iskorost.[i]\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE REGENCY OF OLGA\r\n\r\nOlga, Igor’s widow, assumed the regency in the name of her son\r\nSviatoslav, then of tender age. Her first care was to revenge herself\r\nupon the Drevlians. In Nestor’s narrative it is impossible to separate\r\nthe historical part from the epic. The Russian chronicler recounts in\r\ndetail how the Drevlians sent two deputations to Olga to appease her\r\nand to offer her the hand of their prince; how she caused their death\r\nby treachery, some being buried alive, while others were stifled in a\r\nbath-house; how she besieged their city of Iskorost and offered to grant\r\nthem peace on payment of a tribute of three pigeons and three sparrows\r\nfor each house; how she attached lighted tow to the birds and then sent\r\nthem off to the wooden city, where the barns and the thatched roofs\r\nwere immediately set on fire; how, finally, she massacred part of the\r\ninhabitants of Iskorost and reduced the rest to slavery.\r\n\r\nBut it was this vindictive barbarian woman that was the first of the\r\nruling house of Rurik to adopt Christianity.[d] We have seen before how\r\nChristianity was planted in Kiev under the protection of Askold and\r\nDir, and how the converts to the new religion were specially referred\r\nto in the commercial treaty between Oleg and the Byzantine emperor.\r\nThere existed a Christian community at Kiev but it was to Constantinople\r\nthat Olga went to be baptised in the presence of the patriarch and the\r\nemperor. She assumed the Christian name of Helena, and after her death\r\nshe was canonised in the Russian church. On her return she tried also\r\nto convert her son Sviatoslav, who had by this time become the reigning\r\nprince, but all her efforts were unavailing. He dreaded the ridicule of\r\nthe fierce warriors whom he had gathered about himself. And no doubt the\r\nreligion of Christ was little in consonance with the martial character of\r\nthis true son of the vikings. The chronicle of Nestor gives the following\r\nembellished account of Olga’s conversion:[a]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Nestor Tells of the Baptism of Olga_\r\n\r\nIn the year 948 Olga went to the Greeks and came to Tsargorod\r\n(Constantinople). At that time the emperor was Zimischius,[4] and Olga\r\ncame to him, and seeing that she was of beautiful visage and prudent\r\nmind, the emperor admired her intelligence as he conversed with her\r\nand said to her: “Thou art worthy to reign with us in this city.” When\r\nshe heard these words she said to the emperor: “I am a heathen, if\r\nyou wish me to be baptised, baptise me yourself; otherwise I will not\r\nbe baptised.” So the emperor and patriarch baptised her. When she was\r\nenlightened she rejoiced in body and soul, and the patriarch instructed\r\nher in the faith and said to her: “Blessed art thou among Russian women,\r\nfor thou hast loved light and cast away darkness; the sons of Russia\r\nshall bless thee unto the last generation of thy descendants.” And at\r\nher baptism she was given the name of Helena, who was in ancient times\r\nempress and mother of Constantine the Great. And the patriarch blessed\r\nOlga and let her go.\r\n\r\nAfter the baptism the emperor sent for her and said to her: “I will take\r\nthee for my wife.”\r\n\r\nShe answered: “How canst thou wish to take me for thy wife when thou\r\nthyself hast baptised me and called me daughter? for with the Christians\r\nthis is unlawful and thou thyself knowest it.”\r\n\r\nAnd the emperor said: “Thou hast deceived me, Olga,” and he gave her\r\nmany presents of gold and silver, and silk and vases and let her depart,\r\ncalling her daughter.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: OLGA]\r\n\r\nShe returned to her home, going first to the patriarch to ask his\r\nblessing on her house and saying unto him: “My people are heathen and my\r\nson, too; may God preserve me from harm!”\r\n\r\nAnd the patriarch said: “My faithful daughter, thou hast been baptised\r\nin Christ, thou hast put on Christ, Christ shall preserve thee as he\r\npreserved Enoch in the first ages, and Noah in the Ark, as he preserved\r\nAbraham from Abimelech, Lot from the Sodomites, Moses from Pharaoh, David\r\nfrom Saul, the three young men from the fiery furnace, and Daniel from\r\nthe lions; thus shall he preserve thee from the enemy and his snares!”\r\nThus the patriarch blessed her and she returned in peace to her own land\r\nand came to Kiev.\r\n\r\nOlga lived with her son Sviatoslav and she repeatedly tried to induce\r\nhim to be baptised, but he would not listen to her, for if any one\r\nthen wished to be baptised it was not forbidden, but people mocked at\r\nhim. And Olga often said, “My son, I have learned wisdom and rejoice;\r\nif thou knewest it, thou too wouldst rejoice.” But he paid no heed to\r\nher, saying: “How should I alone adopt a strange faith, my droujina\r\n(followers, men-at-arms) would mock at me.” She said: “If thou art\r\nbaptised, all will do likewise,” but he would not listen to his mother\r\nand persisted in the heathen customs, not knowing that who does not\r\nhearken to his mother shall fall into misfortune, for it is written, he\r\nthat does not hearken to his father or mother, let him die the death.[5]\r\nAnd he was angered against his mother. However, Olga loved her son\r\nSviatoslav, and said: “God’s will be done! If God wills to have mercy on\r\nmy race and on the Russian land, he will put into their hearts to turn to\r\nGod, even as He did unto me.” And having thus said, she prayed for her\r\nson and for the people night and day, and she brought up her son until he\r\nwas grown to be a man.\r\n\r\n\r\nSVIATOSLAV; THE VICTORY OF NORTH OVER SOUTH\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [964-971 A.D.]]\r\n\r\nSviatoslav assumed the reins of government in 964, and he ruled only\r\ntill 972, but this short period was filled with warlike expeditions. He\r\ncrushed the power of the Volga Bulgarians and of the Chazars, and he\r\nincorporated the Viatitchi in the empire--thus destroying the danger ever\r\nmenacing from the east, and uniting all the Slavs under one dominion. In\r\n968 he marched--at the instigation of the Greek emperor, who furnished\r\nhim the means--with an army of sixty thousand men against the Bulgarians\r\nof the Danube, conquered Pereiaslavl (the location of which is unknown)\r\nand Durostorus (the modern Silistria), and began to form the project of\r\nerecting for himself a new empire on the ruins of the Bulgarian power,\r\nwhen tidings reached him of a raid of the Petchenegs against Kiev and\r\nof the imminent danger to his mother and children who were beleaguered\r\nin that town. Leaving garrisons in the conquered towns he hurried back\r\nby forced marches and drove the Petchenegs back into the steppe. He\r\ndivided his Russian dominions among his three young sons, giving Kiev to\r\nIaropolk, the land of the Drevlians to Oleg, and Novgorod to Vladimir;\r\nwhile he himself went back to Bulgaria, for “Pereiaslavl is dear to him,\r\nwhere all good things meet, fine stuffs, wine, fruits, and gold from\r\nGreece, silver and horses from Bohemia and Hungary, furs, wax, honey, and\r\nslaves from Russia.”\r\n\r\nIn 970 he conquered Bulgaria and crossed the Balkans with an army of\r\nthirty thousand men. Defeated before Arcadipole (the present Lüle\r\nBurpas), his barbarian followers gave way to their plundering instincts,\r\nravaged Macedonia, and scattered in all directions, while the emperor\r\nJohn Tzimiskes was making extensive preparations for their annihilation.\r\nThus the year 971 was spent. In March of the next year the Russian\r\ngarrison was almost annihilated at Pereiaslavl, which the Greeks took\r\nby storm, and only a small remnant reached Sviatoslav. In this hour of\r\nneed Sviatoslav exhibited a tremendous energy. By recalling his roving\r\nbands he soon found himself at the head of sixty thousand men, and a\r\npitched battle was fought. Twelve times the victory wavered from one\r\nside to the other, but finally their lack of cavalry and their inferior\r\narmament decided the day against the Russians, and they were forced back\r\nupon Drster. For three months they held the town against a regular siege,\r\nuntil, reduced in numbers by hunger and numerous sorties, Sviatoslav\r\ndecided on a last desperate effort to break through the Greek lines.\r\nThe battle is described in great detail by the Byzantine historians, in\r\nwhom Sviatoslav’s bravery excited admiration. Fifteen thousand Russians\r\nwere left on the field, the survivors were forced back into Durostorus.\r\nSurrounded on all sides, Sviatoslav sued for peace, and Tzimiskes\r\ngranted an honourable retreat to a foe so gallant and withal dangerous.\r\nHe renewed with him the old treaties, undertook to supply his army with\r\nprovisions on its retreat, and also to induce the Petchenegs to grant a\r\nfree passage into Russia. But at the rapids of the Dnieper these sons of\r\nthe steppe surprised Sviatoslav and killed him, and only a small remnant\r\nof his force, led by the voyevod Svenedl, reached Kiev.[g][a]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: VLADIMIR I\r\n\r\n(Died 1015)]\r\n\r\nSviatoslav’s overthrow was, after all, a fortunate event for the Russian\r\nempire. Kiev was already a sufficiently eccentric capital; had Sviatoslav\r\nestablished the seat of government on the Danube, his successor would\r\nhave gone still further; and Rurik, instead of being the founder of a\r\nmighty empire, would have been nothing more than the principal leader of\r\none of those vast but transient irruptions of the northern barbarians,\r\nwhich often ravaged the world without leaving behind any permanent trace\r\nof their passage. But in the Greek emperor Tzimiskes, Sviatoslav met\r\nwith a hero as pertinacious as himself, and with far more talent, and\r\nthe Russians, driven back within the limits of Russia, were compelled to\r\nestablish themselves there.[i]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [977 A.D.]]\r\n\r\nSviatoslav’s death seems to have left no perceptible influence on the\r\ndestinies of Russia, for his three young sons were in the undisputed\r\npossession of authority while he and his warriors were fighting for a\r\nnew empire in the Balkan peninsula. But his division of Russia among\r\nhis sons, as if it were his private estate, soon showed its mischievous\r\neffects. In 977 civil war broke out between Iaropolk, who was at Kiev,\r\nand Oleg, who was in the Drevlian country. The latter was defeated in\r\nbattle, and in his flight met death by the breaking down of a bridge\r\nthronged with fugitives. His territory was thereupon annexed by Iaropolk\r\nto his own dominions.\r\n\r\nVladimir, prince of Novgorod, the youngest of the three brothers, now\r\nbecame alarmed for his own safety and fled across the sea to seek\r\nrefuge among the Scandinavian Varangians. After two years he returned\r\nwith a numerous force of Norse adventurers, expelled from Novgorod the\r\nvoyevods whom Iaropolk had installed there during his absence, and led\r\nhis army against Kiev. On his march he conquered Polotsk on the Dvina,\r\nan independent Varangian principality, killing its prince by the name of\r\nRogvolod (Scand. Rangvaldr) and forcing his daughter Rogneda to marry\r\nhim. Iaropolk, betrayed by his chief men, surrendered Kiev without\r\noffering any resistance and finally delivered his own person into the\r\nhands of Vladimir, by whose order he was put to death. Vladimir now\r\nbecame sole ruler of Russia.\r\n\r\nThe victory of Vladimir over Iaropolk was achieved with the aid of\r\nNorthmen and Novgorodians. It was, therefore, a victory of the Russian\r\nnorth over the Russian south, of Novgorod, where paganism was still\r\nunshaken, over Kiev, which was permeated with Christian elements.\r\nVladimir was brought up in Novgorod, and during his two years’ stay in\r\nSweden he must have become still more strongly impregnated with heathen\r\nideas. Accordingly we find that no sooner was he firmly seated on his\r\nthrone at Kiev than he tried to restore the heathen worship to more than\r\nits pristine strength among the Russian Slavs. Statues of the gods were\r\nerected: Perun, Dashbog, Stribog, Simargla, Mokosh--all of them, with\r\nthe exception of Perun, known to us hardly more than by name. Human\r\nsacrifices were introduced, and two Christians, a father and his son, who\r\nresisted this blood-tax, were killed by a fanatical mob--the first and\r\nonly Christian martyrs on Russian soil. One is tempted to assume that\r\nthe Russian Slavs had originally no representations of the gods, and\r\nthat it was their Norse princes who introduced them--at any rate there\r\nis no mention of images before the arrival of the latter; while the mode\r\nof worship introduced by Vladimir bears a bloody character, quite alien\r\nto the eastern Slavs. It is evident that he is making a last effort to\r\nimpart to the colourless paganism of his subjects a systematic character\r\nwhich would enable it to resist the growing new religion.\r\n\r\nBut the circumstances of this prince soon underwent a change. His Norse\r\nauxiliaries, whose rapacity he could not satisfy, he was soon obliged to\r\ndismiss. According to northern sagas he was even involved in a war with\r\nSweden, the stronghold of heathenism. His new capital was in constant\r\ncommercial intercourse with Byzantium, and the reports that reached him\r\nof its gorgeous worship made a deep impression on the imagination of the\r\nbarbarian. But if he was to accept the religion of the Cæsars, he was\r\ndetermined to do it not as a suppliant, but as a conqueror.[g][a] In what\r\nfollows we give in full the circumstantial account of Nestor.\r\n\r\n\r\nNESTOR’S ACCOUNT OF VLADIMIR’S CONVERSION\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [987 A.D.]]\r\n\r\nIn the year 987, Vladimir called together his boyars and the elders of\r\nthe town, and said to them: “Behold, the Bulgarians have come to me\r\nsaying: Receive our law; then came Germans and they praised their laws;\r\nafter them came the Jews, and finally came the Greeks, blaming all other\r\nlaws, but praising their own, and they spoke at great length, from the\r\ncreation of the world, of the history of the whole world; they speak\r\ncunningly, and it is wonderful and pleasing to hear them; they say that\r\nthere is another world, and that whosoever receives their faith, even\r\nthough he die shall live to all eternity; but if he receive another law\r\nhe shall burn in another world amidst flames. What think ye of it, and\r\nwhat will you answer?”\r\n\r\nAnd the boyars and elders answered, “Thou knowest, prince, that nobody\r\nfinds fault with his own, but on the contrary praises it; if thou\r\ndesirest to test this matter deeply, send some of thy men to study their\r\nvarious faiths and see how each one serves God.” And the speech pleased\r\nthe prince and all the people; ten wise and good men were chosen and\r\nwere told to go first to the Bulgarians and study their faith. So they\r\nwent, and coming saw infamous doings, and how the people worshipped in\r\ntheir mosques, and they returned to their own country. And Vladimir said\r\nto them: “Go now to the Germans, and observe in the same manner, and\r\nafterwards go to the Greeks.” They came to the Germans, and after having\r\nwatched their church services, they went on to Tsargorad (Constantinople)\r\nand came to the emperor; the emperor asked them what brought them there,\r\nand they told him all that had happened. When he had heard it, he was\r\nglad and did them great honour from that day. The next day he sent to the\r\npatriarch saying: “There have come certain Russians to study our faith,\r\nprepare the church and thy clergy, and array thyself in thy episcopal\r\nrobes that they may see the glory of our God.” When the patriarch heard\r\nthis, he called together his clergy and they celebrated the service as\r\nfor a great festival, and they burned incense and the choirs sang. And\r\nthe emperor went with the Russians into the church and they were placed\r\nin a spacious part so that they might see the beauty of the church and\r\nhear the singing; then they explained to them the archiepiscopal service,\r\nthe ministry of the deacons and the divine office. They were filled with\r\nwonderment and greatly admired and praised the service. And the emperors\r\nBasil and Constantine called them and said, “Return now to your country.”\r\nAnd they bade them farewell, giving them great gifts and showing them\r\nhonour.\r\n\r\nWhen they returned to their own country, the prince assembled the boyars\r\nand elders and said to them: “These are the men whom we have sent; they\r\nhave returned, let us listen to what they have seen.” And he said: “Speak\r\nbefore the droujina.” And they said: “First we went to the Bulgarians\r\nand we observed how they worship in their temples, they stand without\r\ngirdles, they sit down and look about them as though they were possessed\r\nby the demon, and there is no gladness amongst them, but only sorrow and\r\na great stench; their religion is not a good one. We then went to the\r\nGermans, and we saw many services celebrated in their temples, but we\r\nsaw no beauty there. Then we came to the Greeks, and they took us where\r\nthey worship their God, and we no longer knew whether we were in heaven\r\nor on earth, for there is nothing like it on earth, nor such beauty, and\r\nwe know not how to tell of it; we only know that it is there, that God\r\ndwells among men, and their service surpasses that of any other land.\r\nWe can never forget its beauty, for as every man when he has tasted\r\nsweetness cannot afterwards endure bitterness, so can we no longer dwell\r\nhere.” The boyars answered: “If the Greek religion were evil, then thy\r\ngrandmother Olga, who was wiser than all men, would not have adopted it.”\r\nAnd Vladimir replied: “Where then shall we be baptised?” They answered:\r\n“Where thou wilt.” And the year passed by.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [988 A.D.]]\r\n\r\nIn the year 988 Vladimir marched with his troops against Kherson, a Greek\r\ntown, and the inhabitants shut themselves up in the town. So Vladimir\r\nestablished himself on the other side of the town, in the bay, at an\r\narrow’s throw from the town. And the people of Kherson fought hard\r\nagainst him, but he blockaded the town and they were exhausted, and\r\nVladimir said to them: “If you do not surrender I will stay three years\r\nif necessary.” But they would not listen to him.\r\n\r\nThen Vladimir ranged his men in battle array and commanded them to build\r\na trench towards the town. And a man of Kherson, by name Anastasius,\r\nthrew out an arrow, on which he had inscribed: “To the east of thee lie\r\nsprings, the waters of which come into the town through pipes; dig there\r\nand thou shalt intercept the water.” When Vladimir heard this he looked\r\nup to heaven and said: “If this comes to pass I will be baptised.” He\r\ncommanded his soldiers to dig above the pipes, and he cut off the water,\r\nand the people, exhausted by thirst, surrendered.\r\n\r\nSo Vladimir with his droujina entered into the town. And he sent\r\nmessengers to Basil and Constantine, saying: “Behold I have conquered\r\nyour famous town. I have heard that you have a maiden sister; if you\r\nwill not give her to me, I will do with your capital even as I have done\r\nwith this town.” The emperors were grieved when this message was brought\r\nto them and sent back the following answer: “It is not meet to give a\r\nChristian maiden in marriage to a heathen. If thou art baptised thou\r\nshalt receive what thou askest, and the kingdom of heaven besides, and\r\nthou shalt be of the same faith as we, but if thou wilt not be baptised\r\nwe cannot give thee our sister.”\r\n\r\nWhen he heard this, Vladimir said to the emperor’s messengers, “Tell\r\nyour emperor thus: I will be baptised, for I have already inquired into\r\nyour religion, and your faith and rites please me well as they have been\r\ndescribed to me by the men whom we have sent.” And when the emperors\r\nheard these words they rejoiced and persuaded their sister, who was\r\nnamed Anna, and sent to Vladimir saying: “Be baptised and we will send\r\nthee our sister.” Vladimir answered: “Let them come with your sister to\r\nbaptise me.” When the emperors heard this they sent their sister with\r\nsome dignitaries and priests; and she did not want to go and said: “I am\r\ngoing like a slave to the heathen, it would be better for me to die.” But\r\nher brothers persuaded her saying: “It is through thee that God shall\r\nturn the hearts of the Russian people to repentance, and thou shalt save\r\nthe land of Greece from a cruel war; seest thou not how much harm the\r\nRussians have already done to the Greeks? And now if thou goest not they\r\nwill do more harm.” And they persuaded her with difficulty. So she took\r\nship, kissed her parents, and weeping went across the sea to Kherson.\r\n\r\nWhen she arrived, the people of Kherson came out to greet her, led her\r\ninto the town, and took her to the palace. By the will of God Vladimir’s\r\neyes were then sore and he could not see anything, he was greatly\r\ntroubled. And the czarina[6] went unto him saying: “If thou desirest to\r\nbe delivered from this malady, be baptised as quickly as possible, or\r\notherwise thou wilt not be cured.” When Vladimir heard this he said: “If\r\nthis is accomplished, truly the God of the Christians is great:” and he\r\nwas baptised. The bishop of Kherson after having announced it to the\r\npeople, baptised Vladimir together with the czarina’s priests, and as\r\nsoon as he laid his hands on him, he saw. When Vladimir perceived how\r\nquickly he was healed, he glorified God, saying: “Now only do I know\r\nthe true God.” And when his droujina saw it, many were also baptised.\r\nVladimir was baptised in the church of St. Basil, which is in Kherson in\r\nthe midst of the town, where the people hold their market.\r\n\r\nAfter the baptism Vladimir was wedded to the czarina. And when he had\r\nbeen baptised the priests expounded to him the Christian faith. After\r\nthis Vladimir with the czarina and Anastasius and the priests of Kherson\r\ntook the relics of St. Clement and St. Theba, his disciple, as well as\r\nthe sacred vessels and relics, and he built a church on an eminence in\r\nthe middle of the town, which had been raised with the earth taken from\r\nthe trench, and this church still exists. As a wedding present to the\r\nczarina he gave back Kherson to the Greeks, and himself returned to Kiev.\r\nWhen he came there he commanded all the idols to be overthrown, some to\r\nbe chopped in pieces, others cast into the flames. Then Vladimir had the\r\nfollowing proclamation made throughout the town. “Whosoever to-morrow,\r\nrich or poor, mendicant or artisan, does not come to the river to be\r\nbaptised, will be as an alien to me.” When the people heard these words,\r\nthey came joyfully saying: “If this faith were not good, the prince and\r\nthe boyars would not have adopted it.” The next day Vladimir came with\r\nthe czarina’s priests and those of Kherson to the banks of the Dnieper,\r\nand an innumerable multitude of people were assembled and they went\r\ninto the water, some up to their necks, others to their breasts; the\r\nyounger ones stood on the banks, men held their children in their arms,\r\nthe adults were quite in the water, and the priests stood repeating\r\nthe prayers. And there was joy in heaven and on earth to see so many\r\nsouls saved. When they were baptised the people returned to their homes\r\nand Vladimir rejoiced that he and his people knew God. He ordered that\r\nchurches and priests should be established in all the towns, and that the\r\npeople should be baptised throughout all the towns and villages; then\r\nhe sent for the children of the chief families and had them instructed\r\nin book learning. Thus was Vladimir enlightened with his sons and his\r\npeople, for he had twelve sons. And he henceforth lived in the Christian\r\nfaith.[h]\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Death of Vladimir the Christian_\r\n\r\nThe chronicler then goes on to describe the changes wrought in Vladimir’s\r\ncharacter by his conversion: how this prince, who had hitherto been an\r\noriental voluptuary and maintained in several places numerous harems\r\nwith hundreds of wives, suddenly changed into the faithful husband of\r\nhis Christian wife; and how he who had murdered his brother (whose wife\r\nhe appropriated) and the father and brother of another of his wives, now\r\nbecame fearful of punishing offenders and criminals lest he commit a sin,\r\nso that it became the duty of his priests to admonish him to enforce\r\njustice and punish the guilty. All this, whether true or false, shows\r\nin what deep veneration the founder of Russian Christianity was held by\r\nsubsequent generations.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, his acceptance of Christianity does not seem to\r\nhave diminished his love of war, which in those days, surrounded as\r\nthe agricultural Russians were by semi-nomadic and marauding tribes,\r\nwas indeed a social necessity. Throughout his reign he was engaged in\r\nsuppressing revolts, reconquering territory lost during the reign of the\r\nweak Iaropolk--Galicia or Red Russia had then been lost to Poland--and\r\npunishing Lithuanians, Volga Bulgarians, and Petchenegs. To secure the\r\nsouthern frontier against these last, he erected a line of fortifications\r\nat strategical points and transplanted a large number of colonists from\r\nthe north to the borders of the steppe.[a]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [1015 A.D.]]\r\n\r\nVladimir died in 1015, leaving a large number of heirs by his numerous\r\nwives. From the division that he made among them of his states we\r\nlearn what was the extent of Russia at that epoch. To Iaroslav he gave\r\nNovgorod; to Iziaslav, Polotsk; to Boris, Rostov; to Gleb, Murom--these\r\nlast two principalities being in the Finn country; to Sviatoslav, the\r\ncountry of the Drevlians; to Vsevolod, Vladimir in Volhynia; to Mstislav,\r\nTmoutarakan[7]; to his nephew Sviatopolk, the son of his brother and\r\nvictim Iaropolk, the principality of Tourov, in the country of Minsk,\r\nfounded by a Varangian named Tour, who, like Askold and Rogvolod, was not\r\nof the blood of princes.[j]\r\n\r\nThis division of the territories of the state among the heirs of the\r\nprince was in entire accord with the ideas of the Norse conquerors, who\r\nregarded their conquests as their private property. It was, moreover,\r\ndictated by the economic conditions of the time. Money being but rarely\r\nemployed and all payments being made in service and in kind, it was\r\nindispensable, in making provision for the members of the ruling house,\r\nto supply them with territories and subjects. The immense extent of\r\nRussia, the lack of adequate means of communication, and its subdivision\r\namong a large number of tribes without any national cohesion, were\r\nfurther reasons for the introduction of this system of government.[a]\r\n\r\n\r\nSVIATOPOLK IS SUCCEEDED BY IAROSLAV (1019 A.D.)\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [1019 A.D.]]\r\n\r\nSviatopolk, who claimed a divided parentage between Vladimir and\r\nIaropolk--being the son of the widow of the latter, who on the murder\r\nof her husband was forced to live with the former, she being already\r\npregnant--was at Kiev when the news of Vladimir’s death arrived. He had\r\nlong indulged in a project for seizing the throne, which was favoured in\r\nits formation by the increasing imbecility of his father, whose death\r\nnow ripened it into action. His ambitious schemes embraced a plan for\r\nsecuring the sole monarchy, by obtaining the grand princedom first, and\r\nthen by artifice or treachery to put his brothers out of the way, so that\r\nhe might thus reorganise under the one head the divided and independent\r\ngovernments. The moment had now arrived when this violent scheme was\r\nto be put into execution. His brother Boris, who was employed with the\r\narmy against the Petchenegs, was the first object of his hate and fear,\r\nbecause his good qualities had so strongly recommended him, that he\r\nwas the most popular of the brothers, and the most likely to gain the\r\nascendency through the will of the people. There was but one sure method\r\nto get rid of this formidable rival, and Sviatopolk did not hesitate to\r\nadopt it. When the intelligence of his father’s decease reached Boris,\r\nhe declared that the throne devolved properly upon the elder brother,\r\nand rejected the unanimous offer of the soldiery to assist in placing\r\nhim upon it. This noble insensibility to the general wish alienated his\r\ntroops, and exposed him to the designs of his treacherous rival. The\r\nassassins who were commissioned to despatch him found easy access to his\r\ntent, and having first slain a faithful Russian who threw himself before\r\nthe person of his master, they soon effected their horrible purpose.\r\n\r\nTwo other brothers met a similar fate. Gleb was informed by letter that\r\nhis father was ill, and desired his return. On his way he was so injured\r\nby a fall from his horse as to be forced to continue his journey in a\r\nlitter. In this state he learned that Sviatopolk had issued orders for\r\nhis murder, which, tempted probably by the reward, were carried into\r\neffect by his own cook, who stabbed him with a knife in the breast.\r\nBoth Gleb and Boris were afterwards sainted, which appears to have been\r\nthe last compliment paid by the Russians to their ill-used princes.\r\nThese villainies alarmed a third brother, who fled to Hungary; but the\r\nemissaries of the triumphant assassin seized him in his flight, brought\r\nhim back to the capital, and put him to death.\r\n\r\nThe way to the throne was now tolerably well cleared. Sviatopolk I found\r\nno further difficulty in assuming the government of Kiev, and calling in\r\nsuch of the tributary provinces as his recent excesses either terrified\r\ninto submission or reduced within his control. But the most powerful\r\nopponent yet remained to be subjugated.\r\n\r\nIaroslav, prince of Novgorod, alarmed and outraged by the cruelties of\r\nhis brother, and apprehending that, unless they were speedily arrested,\r\nthey would spread into his own principality, determined to advance upon\r\nKiev and make war on the usurping fratricide. The Novgorodians, to\r\nwhom he was greatly endeared by the wisdom and mildness of his sway,\r\nentered so warmly into the expedition, that the tyrant was driven out of\r\nKiev without much cost of blood, and obliged to flee for refuge to his\r\nfather-in-law, the duke of Poland. At that period Poland was resting from\r\nthe ruinous effects of a disastrous and straggling campaign in Germany\r\nwhich had considerably reduced her power, and curtailed her means of\r\nsatisfying the ambition of her restless ruler. The representations of\r\nSviatopolk rekindled the ardour of the Poles, who, animated as much by\r\nthe desire of recovering those provinces which Vladimir had formerly\r\nwrested from Miecelsas, as by the prospect of ulterior aggrandisement,\r\nreadily fell into the proposals of the exiled prince to make an attempt\r\nfor his restoration to the throne. Boleslav at the head of a powerful\r\nforce, advanced into Russia. Iaroslav, however, apprised of the movements\r\nof the enemy, met them on the banks of the Bug, prepared for battle. The\r\narmy of Boleslav lay at the opposite side. For some time the invader\r\nhesitated to ford the river under the fire of the Russian soldiers; and\r\nmight, probably, have returned as he came, had not a petty occurrence\r\nexcited his impetuosity, and urged him forward. A Russian soldier one\r\nday, while both armies lay inactive within sight of each other, stood\r\nupon the bank of the river, and with gesticulations and bold language\r\nmimicked the corpulent size and gait of the Polish duke. This insult\r\nroused the spirit of Boleslav, who, plunging into the water, and calling\r\non his men to follow, landed in the face of the Russians at the head\r\nof his intrepid troops. A long and well-contested action took place,\r\nand tardily closed in favour of the Poles, who, flushed with victory,\r\npursued the fugitives to the walls of the capital. Sviatopolk was now\r\nreinstated in his throne, and Iaroslav, disheartened by defeat, made his\r\nway to Novgorod, where, doubtful even of the fidelity of his own people,\r\nhe prepared to cross the Baltic in order to get beyond the reach of his\r\nbrother. The Novgorodians, however, were faithful, and proved their\r\nattachment to his person by taking down the rigging of the vessels which\r\nhad been got in readiness for his departure, and by levying contributions\r\namongst themselves for the purpose of enabling him to procure auxiliary\r\ntroops to assist in the recovery of the grand principality.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: IAROSLAV I\r\n\r\n(Died 1054)]\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, Sviatopolk was unconsciously facilitating his own\r\ndownfall. After the Poles had helped him to re-establish himself, he\r\nbegan to feel the oppressive superiority of their presence, and plotted\r\na base design to remove them. He instigated the inhabitants and the\r\nsoldiery to conspire against the strangers, and massacre them in the\r\nmidst of their security. Boleslav discovered the plot before it had time\r\nto be carried into execution; and, disgusted at a design so cruel and\r\ntreacherous, he resolved to take ample revenge. The capital was plundered\r\nof its accumulated wealth by the incensed Poles, who, but for the\r\nmoderation of their leader, would have burned it to ashes; and, loaded\r\nwith treasures, they returned towards the Russian frontiers. Sviatopolk\r\nwas artful enough to turn the whole transaction to the discredit of his\r\nally, and thus to rouse the courage of his followers, who were easily\r\npersuaded to take the field against Boleslav. The belligerents met on\r\nthe banks of the Bug before the Poles had passed the boundaries. The\r\nbattle that ensued terminated in the discomfiture of Sviatopolk, who\r\nnow returned with broken fortunes to the capital which he had so lately\r\nentered with acclamations of triumph. This was the opportunity for\r\nIaroslav to appear with his followers. The usurper’s troops were so\r\nreduced by his late disasters, that he was forced to seek assistance\r\nfrom the Petchenegs, the hereditary enemies of the country; and they,\r\ntempted by hopes of booty, flocked to his standard to resist the approach\r\nof Iaroslav. The armies met on a plain near the place where Boris had\r\nbeen assassinated by the command of the fratricide. The coincidence\r\nwas fortunate, for Iaroslav, taking a prudent advantage of the\r\ncircumstance, employed all his eloquence in describing to his soldiers\r\nthe righteousness of the cause in which they were engaged against a\r\nsecond Cain, the shedder of a brother’s blood. His oration, concluding\r\nwith a fervent prayer to the Almighty to nerve his arm, and direct his\r\nsword, so that he might be made the instrument of reparation in so just\r\na fight, wrought powerfully upon the assembled army, and excited them to\r\nan unexampled display of bravery. The advantage of numbers was on the\r\nopposite side; but such was the courage exhibited by the Novgorodians,\r\nthat after a desperate battle, which lasted throughout the whole day,\r\nthey succeeded in putting the enemy completely to flight. Sviatopolk took\r\nto horse and fled, but died in a wretched condition on the road.\r\n\r\nThe zeal and bravery of the Novgorodians were not forgotten by Iaroslav\r\nwhen he ascended the throne and concentrated the sole dominion in\r\nhimself. His first attention was directed to the revision of the\r\nill-constructed laws of their city, and to the grant of certain\r\nfranchises, which had the effect of procuring unanimity amongst the\r\ninhabitants, and of establishing the peaceful arts and commercial\r\ninterests of the place upon a sure and solid foundation. He at once\r\nevinced a capacity for legislation beyond the abilities of his most\r\ndistinguished predecessors, and set about the labours of improvement in\r\nso vigorous a temper, and with so much aptitude for his objects, that the\r\nhappiest results sprang up under his administration in all parts of the\r\nempire.\r\n\r\nBut it was not in the destiny of the age in which he lived to permit\r\nsuch extensive benefits to progress without interruption. His brother\r\nMstislav, the seventh son of Vladimir, a warrior distinguished in his\r\nwars against the Kossoges, discontented with the enlarged authority\r\nthat the grand princedom vested in the hands of Iaroslav, transmitted\r\nto him a petition praying of him to cede to him a part of the fraternal\r\nappanage which he governed. Iaroslav partially assented to the request,\r\nby granting to his brother the small territory of Murom. This grant was\r\ninsufficient to satisfy Mstislav, who immediately equipped an army and\r\nproceeded to wage an offensive war against the monarch. In this war the\r\ninvader was successful, but he was not ungenerous in his triumph; for\r\nwhen he had vanquished the grand prince, he restored to him so large a\r\nportion of his possessions that the empire became equally divided between\r\nthem. In this league of amity the brothers continued to govern for seven\r\nyears, during the remainder of the life of Mstislav; and at his death\r\nthe colossal empire, with all its appanages, reverted to the hands of\r\nIaroslav.\r\n\r\nIt is in this part of his reign, and in this memorable period in the\r\nannals of the nation, that we find the first development of justice in\r\nRussian legislation, and the first application of philosophy to the\r\nmanagement of public affairs. Although Iaroslav’s career commenced with\r\nwar, and although he extended his arms into Finland, Livonia, Lithuania,\r\nand Bulgaria, and even penetrated into Byzantium, yet it was not by\r\nwar that the glory of his name or the ability of his rule was to be\r\naccomplished. His wars could hardly claim the merits of conquests; and\r\nin some instances they terminated in such vague conclusions, that they\r\nresembled drawn battles on which much treasure had been lavished in vain.\r\nIn Greece he was routed. He was driven before the soldiers of Sviatopolk,\r\nand forced to surrender at his own gates to the victorious Mstislav.\r\nHis utmost successes amounted to preservation against aggression; and\r\nso indifferent was he to the barbarian mode of elevating the empire by\r\nwanton and hazardous expeditions into the neighbouring countries, that\r\non most of those occasions he entrusted the command of his army to his\r\nlieutenants. It is necessary to explain that part of his character, in\r\norder that the loftiness of his nature may be the more clearly understood.\r\n\r\nAt this period the Russian Empire comprehended those enormous tracts that\r\nlie between the Volga and the lower Danube, and stretch from the Black\r\nSea to the Baltic. This accumulation of territory was not the work of\r\na progressive political system; it was not accomplished by the growth\r\nof a powerful government or by the persevering pursuit of co-operating\r\ninterests, and the increasing circles of acquisition were in a constant\r\nstate of dismemberment, separation, and recall. The surface of the\r\nland from the days of Rurik was overrun by revolutions. The marauder,\r\nlegalised by his tribe, haunted the forest and devastated the populous\r\nplaces, carrying away with him plunder, or usurping authority wherever\r\nhe remained. The feudal system, introduced by the Scandinavians as a\r\nprovision for troublesome leaders, was carried to excess. The nominal\r\nhead was disavowed and resisted at will; and the subordinate governments\r\nmade war upon each other, or joined in schemes of rapine, with impunity.\r\nThe maintenance of each fief seemed to depend upon civil war; and the\r\noffice of the grand prince was not so much to govern the dominions he\r\npossessed, as to keep, if he could, the dominion he was called upon to\r\ngovern.\r\n\r\nRussia, combining these gigantic outlines of territory, was now, for\r\nthe second time, united under one head; but, for the first time, under\r\na head that could discern her necessities, and provide for them. Her\r\ncivilisation was in progress, but it wanted the impetus of knowledge, and\r\nthe control of law. The reign of the sword had done its work: what was\r\nrequired was the reign of justice and wisdom to improve and consolidate\r\nthe triumphs and acquisitions of the barbarian era. In Iaroslav, Russia\r\nfound a prince whose genius was adapted to her critical circumstances. He\r\neffectually raised her from obscurity, and placed her for a time amongst\r\nthe family of European states. He made her church independent, increased\r\nthe privileges of the people, facilitated the means of instruction, and\r\nelevated her national dignity by contracting domestic alliances with\r\nthe most powerful countries. His sister was queen of Poland; his three\r\ndaughters-in-law were Greek, German, and English princesses; and the\r\nqueens of Norway, Hungary, and France were his daughters. But these were\r\nthe least memorable evidences of his greatness. He gave Russia a code of\r\nlaws, which was more valuable to her than the highest connections, or the\r\nmost ambitious accessions of dominion.\r\n\r\n\r\nIAROSLAV’S CODE OF LAWS\r\n\r\nThis code must be judged in reference to the times in which it was\r\nenacted and in comparison with the formless mass of confused precedents\r\nit superseded. The existence of commercial cities in Russia so far back\r\nas the invasion of Rurik, may be accepted as presumptive proof that there\r\nwere not wanting some regulations to render individuals amenable to the\r\ncommon good. But these were merely the rude precepts of the hunting and\r\nagricultural nations matured into a stronger form, and adapted to the\r\nwants of the commercial community. When the Scandinavians subjugated\r\nthe aborigines, the languages, customs, and laws of both fell into\r\nstill greater confusion by admixture. When each was imperfect, it was\r\nunlikely that a forcible intermixture would have improved either, or led\r\nto the harmonious union of both. It is to be observed, too, that none\r\nof the nations that made up the population possessed written laws; so\r\nthat whatever notions of legislation they entertained, were constantly\r\nliable to the fluctuations of capricious opinion, and were always subject\r\nto the interpretation of the strong over the weak. Where there were\r\nno records there was but little responsibility, and even that little\r\nwas diminished by the character of the rulers and the lawlessness of\r\nthe ruled. The exclusive attention of the princes being of necessity\r\nconfined to the most effectual methods of preserving their sovereignties,\r\nof enlarging their domains, and of exacting tributes, it was natural\r\nthat the unsystematic and crude usages that prevailed should fall into\r\nfurther contempt, and, instead of acquiring shape and consistency from\r\nexperience, become still more oppressive, dark, and indecisive.\r\n\r\nIt was this matter of incongruities that Iaroslav cast out; supplying\r\nits place with a series of written laws, in which some sacrifices were\r\nmade to popular customs, but which, on the whole, was an extraordinary\r\nboon to a people that, like mariners at sea without a compass, were\r\ntossed about in a tumult of uncertainty and perplexity. Had Iaroslav been\r\na mere soldier, like the majority of his predecessors, he would have\r\nemployed his talents in the field, and directed the enormous physical\r\nmeans at his command to the purposes of a wild and desolating ambition.\r\nBut his policy was in advance of the heathen age: it restrained boundless\r\nlicentiousness, created immunities, protected life and property, bestowed\r\nrewards, enacted punishments, established safeguards and facilities for\r\ntrade, and expounded and confirmed those distinctions of ranks in which\r\na community on a large scale recognises the elements of its permanency.\r\nHe had the magnanimity to forego vulgar conquests for the higher conquest\r\nof prejudices and ancient habits. The people, probably fatigued with\r\nthe restlessness of their mode of life, and yearning after repose and\r\nsettlement, rendered now more necessary by the rapid increase of their\r\nnumbers, received his laws with gratitude.\r\n\r\nA short outline of the leading provisions of these laws will form a\r\ncurious and valuable commentary upon the character of the grand prince,\r\nand the actual state of the people at this period (1018). The first\r\narticle of the code empowers the friends of a murdered man to take\r\nsatisfaction upon the murderer; constituting the law as the public\r\navenger only in cases where there are no friends to take their vengeance\r\nin kind. In the event of there being no relatives to take the revenge\r\ninto their own hands, the law goes on to enact that the assassin shall\r\npay into the public treasury a certain fine, according to the rank of\r\nhis victim. Thus, for the murder of a boyar, or thane of the prince, the\r\nmulct was fixed at the highest penalty of eighty grivnas;[8] for a page\r\nof the prince, his cook, or other domestics, for a merchant, for the\r\nsword-bearer of a boyar, and for every free Russian, without distinction\r\nof origin, forty grivnas; for a woman, half the usual fine: no fine for\r\nkilling a slave; but if killed without sufficient cause, the value to be\r\npaid to the master: for a serf belonging to a boyar or free Russian, five\r\ngrivnas to the owner; for the superintendent of a village, an artisan,\r\nschoolmaster, or nurse, twelve grivnas; for a female servant, six grivnas\r\nto the master, and twelve to the state.\r\n\r\nFrom these penalties a correct estimate may be formed of the principles\r\nupon which the social fabric was erected. In all these provisions the\r\nrich were favoured above the poor, the strong above the weak. The life\r\nof a woman, because her utility in a barbarous community was rated\r\naccording to its menial value, was fixed at half the worth of a man’s,\r\nto be proportioned according to her station. The murder of a slave was\r\nnot visited with any penalty whatever; the exception constituting, in\r\nfact, the privilege to kill a slave at pleasure. Slavery was carried to\r\nextremity in Russia. Prisoners of war and their posterity were condemned\r\nto perpetual slavery; the poverty of the soil, and the oppression of its\r\nlords, forced many to sell their freedom for limited periods; insolvent\r\ndebtors became slaves by law; and all freemen who married slaves\r\nunconditionally, participated in their servitude.\r\n\r\nYet, degrading as these institutions must be considered, it appears\r\nthat the rights of the person were scrupulously maintained. Thus this\r\ncode enumerates penalties for striking a blow, describes the different\r\ndegrees of the offence, and regulates the responsibility accordingly. The\r\ndistinctions drawn between the different modes of striking are singular,\r\nand help to show that, ill as the Russians could appreciate public\r\nliberty, they had a jealous sense of that individual respect which, in\r\nmodern Europe, is called the point of honour. The penalty for striking\r\na blow with the scabbard or handle of a sword, with the fist, a stick,\r\ncup, or goblet, was twelve grivnas--equal to the fine for murdering an\r\nartisan or a schoolmaster. If the blow was struck with a club, which, we\r\npresume, was considered a plebeian weapon, the penalty was only three\r\ngrivnas. But the most characteristic penalty was that of twelve grivnas\r\nfor pulling a man by the beard, or knocking out a tooth. The origin of\r\nthis law may be easily traced to the Goths and Germans, who were rigid\r\nin the preservation of their hair, to which they attached extraordinary\r\nimportance. In the same spirit was the enactment that prohibited the\r\nmaking use of a horse without the permission of the owner, and that\r\nvisited with imprisonment for life the crime of horse-stealing. This\r\nlegal protection of the horse is still preserved in the Saxon laws.\r\n\r\nThe prevailing tendency of the code was to secure to each man his lawful\r\nproperty, and to arm him with the means of protection. Yet it must be\r\nremarked as a strange inconsistency, in the midst of this anxiety to\r\nerect safeguards around property, that fraudulent debtors were granted\r\na direct escape from liability to consequences. It was enacted, that if\r\none man lent money to another, and the latter denied the loan, the ordeal\r\nshould not apply; the oath of the defendant being deemed a sufficient\r\nrelease from the debt. This law was the more unaccountable in a country\r\nwhere the legal interest of money was forty per cent.,--a circumstance\r\ncalculated to increase the motives to dishonesty.\r\n\r\nAnother enactment makes a distinction between the Varangians and\r\nSlavs, which illustrates the fact that the latter had always been more\r\nadvanced in civilisation than the former. By this enactment, a Koblegian\r\nor a Varangian was compelled to take an oath where such a test was\r\nrequired, but a Slavonian was exempted. It would therefore appear, if\r\nthe conclusion may be safely ventured upon, that judicial combats,\r\nwhich formed the final appeal when a defendant in a cause acquitted\r\nhimself in the first instance by a solemn oath, were not adopted amongst\r\nthe Slavs, who were satisfied with a public examination of facts,\r\nand an adjudication, without the sacred or the physical test. It is\r\nsufficient, however, for the great uses of historical inquiry, to know\r\nthat a difference so remarkable between two branches of the people was\r\nrecognised and confirmed by law.\r\n\r\nOne of the most important declarations of the code was that which\r\ndivided the population into three classes--the nobles, the freemen, and\r\nthe slaves. Of these three, the slaves alone were left unprotected.\r\nThe freemen, who were fenced in from the encroachments of the nobles,\r\nwere composed of the citizens, the farmers, the landholders, and hired\r\nservants. They were sub-classified into centuries, each of which elected\r\na head, who filled an office equivalent to that of a tribune. The civil\r\nmagistracy, thus created, had a separate guard of their own, and were\r\nplaced, in virtue of their office, on an equality with the boyars. The\r\ncity of Novgorod, which maintained, under a nominal princedom, the\r\nspirit of a republic, exhibited these municipal franchises in a more\r\ncomplete form than any of the Russian cities; all of which, however,\r\npossessed similar privileges, more or less modified according to their\r\nrelative importance, or the circumstances under which their charters\r\nwere granted. The chief of the Novgorodian republic was a prince of the\r\nblood; the title of his office was that of Namestnick. He took no share\r\nin the deliberations of the people, nor does it appear that he even\r\npossessed a veto upon their decisions. His oath of instalment bound him\r\nas the slave rather than the governor of the city; for it pledged him to\r\ngovern agreeably to the constitution as he found it; to appoint none but\r\nNovgorodian magistrates in the provinces, and even these to be previously\r\napproved of by the Posadnick or mayor; to respect strictly the exclusive\r\nrights possessed by the citizens sitting in judgment on their own order,\r\nof imposing their own taxes, and of carrying on commerce at their own\r\ndiscretion; to interdict his boyars from acquiring landed property within\r\nthe villages dependent on Novgorod, and to oblige them to travel at their\r\nprivate cost; to discourage immigration; and never to cause a Novgorodian\r\nto be arrested for debt. A princedom, accepted on such restrictive\r\nconditions, was but the shadow of a sceptre, as the municipal union of\r\nthe legislative and judicial abundantly proved. The first officer was\r\nthe Posadnick, or mayor, chosen by election for a limited time; the\r\nnext was the Tisiatski, or tribune, who was a popular check upon the\r\nprince and mayor; and the rest of the functionaries consisted of the\r\nsenate, the city assembly, and the boyars, all of whom were elective.\r\nBy the electoral system, the people preserved a constant guard over the\r\nfidelity of their representatives in the senate, and their officers of\r\njustice; so that, while the three grades propounded by law were kept\r\nwidely apart, and socially distinguished, the prerogatives of each were\r\nrigidly protected against innovation from the other two. All that this\r\nlittle republic required to render its security perfect, was liberty.\r\nIt was based upon a system of slavery, and sustained its dominion more\r\nby fear than righteousness. Nor was it independent of control, although\r\nall its domestic concerns were uninterruptedly transacted within its\r\nown confines. It was an appanage of the grand princedom; but on account\r\nof its fortunate geographical position on the northern and northwestern\r\nfrontiers, which were distant from the capital--a circumstance that\r\ndelegated to Novgorod the defence of those remote boundaries--it acquired\r\na degree of political importance that preserved it for four centuries\r\nagainst the cupidity of the succession of despots that occupied the\r\nthrone. The removal of the seat of empire from Kiev to Vladimir, and\r\nfinally to Moscow, by drawing the centre nearer to Novgorod, diminished\r\nits power by degrees, and finally absorbed it altogether.\r\n\r\nOne of the enactments of the code of Iaroslav will show what advances had\r\nbeen made towards the segregation of the people into different orders,\r\nand how much the government partook, or was likely to partake, of a mixed\r\nform, in which a monarchical, an hereditary, and a representative estate\r\nwere combined. It made the prince the heir-at-law of every freeman who\r\ndied without male issue, with the exception of the boyars and officers\r\nof the royal guard. By this regulation the prerogative of the crown\r\nwas rendered paramount, while the hereditary rights of property were\r\npreserved unconditionally to the families of the nobles alone. A class of\r\nrich patricians was thus formed and protected, to represent, by virtue of\r\nbirth, the interests of property; while commerce and popular privileges\r\nwere fully represented in the assembly of the elected senators. The\r\nchecks and balances of this system were pretty equal; so that, if the\r\nconstitution of which these outlines were the elements, had been allowed\r\nto accumulate strength and to become consolidated by time, it would\r\nat last have resolved itself into a liberal and powerful form; the\r\nsemi-savage usages with which it was encrusted would have dropped away,\r\nand wiser institutions have grown up in their stead.\r\n\r\nSo clearly were the popular benefits of the laws defined, that the code\r\nregulated the maximum demand which the proprietor of the soil might\r\nexact from his tenant; and it neither enforced taxation, nor recognised\r\ncorporal punishment, nor in the composition of a pecuniary mulct admitted\r\nany distinction between the Varangians and the Slavs, who formed the\r\naristocracy and the democracy. The prince neither possessed revenue\r\nnor levied taxes. He subsisted on the fines he imposed for infractions\r\nof law, on the tributes he received from his estates, on the voluntary\r\nofferings of the people, and the produce of such property as had fallen\r\nto the private title of the sovereignty. Even the tribute was not\r\ncompulsory; it was rather a right derived from prescription. The only\r\ndependence of the lords of fiefs was in that they were compelled to\r\nrender military service when required to the grand prince; and it was\r\nexpected that they should come numerously attended, well armed, and\r\nprovisioned. The tribute was the mark of conquest, and was not considered\r\nto imply taxation.\r\n\r\nBut while the monarchical principle was thus kept within proscribed\r\nlimits, the power of the democracy was not sufficiently curbed: over both\r\nthere was a check, but the hands of the prince were bound too tightly.\r\nHis dominion was despotic, because he was surrounded by men devoted to\r\nhis will; but the dominion of the people was boundless, because opinion\r\nwas only in its rickety infancy, and the resistance to the offending\r\nprince lay in the demonstration of physical superiority instead of moral\r\ncombination. They never hesitated to avail themselves of their numerical\r\nadvantage. They even carried it to extravagance and licentiousness;\r\nand so much did they exult in their strength, that they regulated the\r\nhours at which the sovereign was permitted to enjoy relaxation, punished\r\nthe obnoxious heads of the church by summary ejectment, and in several\r\ninstances, taking the charter of law into their own keeping, deposed\r\ntheir princes. The checks, therefore, established in Iaroslav’s wise\r\nconvention between the government and the constituency were overborne by\r\nthe rudeness of the times.\r\n\r\nThat the period had arrived when laws were necessary to the settlement\r\nof the empire, was sufficiently testified by the circumstances,\r\nexternal and domestic, in which the people were placed. The adoption\r\nof Christianity had partially appeased the old passion for aggression\r\nagainst Constantinople, which, having now become the metropolis of their\r\nreligion, was regarded with some degree of veneration by the Russians.\r\nA war of plundering Byzantium, therefore, could not be entertained with\r\nany prospect of success. The extension of the empire under Vladimir left\r\nlittle to be coveted beyond the frontiers, which spread to the east,\r\nnorth and south as far as even the wild grasp of the lawless tribes of\r\nthe forests could embrace. To the west, the Russians had ceased to look\r\nfor prey, since Boleslav, by his easy conquest of Kiev, had demonstrated\r\nthe strength of Poland. Having acquired as much as they could, and\r\nhaving next, in the absence of warlike expeditions abroad, occupied\r\nthemselves with ruthless feuds at home, they came at length to consider\r\nthe necessity of consulting the security of possessions acquired at so\r\nmuch cost, and so often risked by civil broils. This was the time for\r\na code of laws. But unfortunately there still existed too many remains\r\nof the barbarian era, to render the introduction of legal restraints\r\na matter easy of accomplishment. The jealousy of Greek superiority\r\nsurvived the admission of the Greek religion. The longing after power\r\nstill inspired the petty chiefs; and hopeless dreams of larger dominion\r\nwherewith to bribe the discontented, and provide for the hirelings of the\r\nstate, still troubled the repose of the sovereign. The throne stood in a\r\nplain surrounded by forests, from whence issued, as the rage propelled\r\nthem, hordes of newly reclaimed savages, pressing extraordinary demands,\r\nor threatening with ferocious violence the dawning institutions of\r\ncivilisation. In such a position, it was not only impossible to advance\r\nsteadily, but to maintain the ground already gained.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Iaroslav Dies (1054 A.D.)_\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [1054 A.D.]]\r\n\r\nCould the character of Iaroslav, the legislator, have been transmitted\r\nthrough his successors, the good of which he laid the seeds, might have\r\nbeen finally cultivated to maturity. But his wisdom and his virtues died\r\nwith him. Nor, elevated as he was in moral dignity above the spirit of\r\nhis countrymen, can it be said that he was free from weaknesses that\r\nmarred much of the utility of his best measures. One of his earliest\r\nerrors was the resignation of Novgorod to his son Vladimir, who had\r\nno sooner ascended the throne of the republican city, than, under the\r\npretext of seeking satisfaction for the death of a Russian who had been\r\nkilled in Greece, he carried arms into the Byzantine empire. The folly of\r\nthis wild attempt was abundantly punished in the sequel; fifteen thousand\r\nmen were sacrificed on the Grecian plains, and their chief hunted back\r\ndisgracefully to his own territories. Yet this issue of one family grant\r\ndid not awaken Iaroslav to the danger of partitioning the empire. Before\r\nhis death he divided the whole of Russia amongst his sons, making,\r\nhowever, the younger sons subordinate to the eldest, as grand prince\r\nof Kiev, and empowering the latter to reduce the others to obedience\r\nby force of arms whenever they exhibited a disposition to dispute his\r\nauthority.\r\n\r\nThis settlement, enforced with parting admonitions on his death-bed, was\r\nconsidered by Iaroslav to present a sufficient security against civil\r\ncommotion and disputes about the succession. But he did not calculate\r\nupon the ungovernable lust for power, the jealousy of younger brothers,\r\nand the passion for aggrandisement. His injunctions were uttered in the\r\namiable confidence of Christianity; they were violated with the indecent\r\nimpetuosity of the barbarian nature.\r\n\r\nWith the death of Iaroslav, and the division of the empire, a new period\r\nof darkness and misrule began. The character of the legislator, which\r\ninfluenced his own time, was speedily absorbed in the general confusion.\r\nIaroslav’s name was held in reverence, but the memory of his excellence\r\ndid not awe the multitudes that, upon his decease, sprang from their\r\nretirement to revive the disastrous glories of domestic warfare. Much\r\nas he had done for the extension of Christianity, he had failed in\r\nestablishing it in the hearts of the people. He was an able theologian,\r\nand well acquainted with the church ordinances, agenda, and other books\r\nof the Greek religion, many of which he caused to be translated into\r\nthe Russian language, and distributed in copies over the country. So\r\nstrong an interest did he take in the cultivation of the doctrines of the\r\nchurch, that he established a metropolitan at Kiev, in order to relieve\r\nthe Russian people and their priests from the inconveniences of attending\r\nthe residence of the ecclesiastical head at Constantinople, and also with\r\na desire to provide for the more prompt and certain dissemination of the\r\nprinciples of faith. But the value of all these exertions expired with\r\ntheir author. He did much to raise the fame and consolidate the resources\r\nof the empire; but the last act of his political career, by which he cut\r\naway the cord that bound the rods, had the effect of neutralising all the\r\nbenefits he meditated to accomplish, as well as those that he actually\r\neffected, for his country. His reign was followed by a period of savage\r\nanarchy that might be said to have resolved the half-civilised world into\r\nits original elements.[k]\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES\r\n\r\n[2] According to recent computations the Russian Empire covers an area of\r\n8,660,000 square miles--about one sixth of the land surface of the globe.\r\n\r\n[3] [This treaty was not so favourable to the Russians as the one\r\nconcluded with Oleg--a result, evidently, of the former defeat. Another\r\npoint of importance is that it makes mention of Russian Christians, to\r\nwhom there is no allusion in the treaty of 911. From this we may conclude\r\nthat Christianity had spread largely during this interval.[g]]\r\n\r\n[4] [According to another Ms., Constantine, son of Lev.]\r\n\r\n[5] _Ex.

THE PERIOD OF THE PRINCIPALITIES\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CHARACTER OF THE PRINCIPALITIES\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [1054-1224 A.D.]]\r\n\r\nThe period extending from the year of Iaroslav’s death (1054) to the\r\nyear of the appearance of the Tatars (1224) is one of the most troublous\r\nand confused epochs in the history of Russia. As the Scandinavian custom\r\nof partition continued to prevail over the Byzantine idea of political\r\nunity, the national territory was constantly divided.\r\n\r\nThe princely anarchy of oriental Europe finds a parallel in the feudal\r\nanarchy of the Occident. Pogodine enumerates for this period sixty-four\r\nprincipalities which enjoyed a more or less protracted existence; two\r\nhundred and ninety-three princes who during these two centuries contended\r\nover Kiev and other Russian domains; eighty-three civil wars in which the\r\nentire country was concerned. Foreign wars helped to augment the enormous\r\nmass of historical facts. The chronicles mention against the Polovtsi\r\nalone eighteen campaigns, while these barbarians invaded Christian\r\nterritory forty-six times.\r\n\r\nThe ancient names of the Slav tribes have entirely disappeared, or are\r\npreserved only in the names of towns--as, for instance, that of the\r\nPolotchanes in Polotsk; that of the Severians in Novgorod-Seversk. The\r\nelements in the composition of Russia were thus rather principalities\r\nthan peoples. No more is said of the Krivitchi or of the Drevlians;\r\nwe hear only of Smolensk or of Volhinia. These little states were\r\ndismembered at each new division among the children of a prince; they\r\nwere then reconstituted, to be again divided into appanages. In spite of\r\nall these vicissitudes, however, some among them had an uninterrupted\r\nexistence due to certain topographical and ethnographical conditions.\r\nSetting aside the distant principality of Tmoutorakan, established\r\nalmost at the foot of the Caucasus in the midst of Turkish and Circassian\r\ntribes and counting eight different princes, the following are, from the\r\neleventh to the thirteenth centuries, the principal divisions of Russia:\r\n\r\n(1) The principality of Smolensk, which occupied the important territory\r\nwhich is in a manner the central point of the orographic system of\r\nRussia; it comprises the old forest of Okov, where the three greatest\r\nrivers of Russia, the Volga, the Dnieper, and the Dvina, have their rise.\r\nHence the political importance of Smolensk, which is attested by the many\r\nwars undertaken against her; hence also her commercial prosperity. It is\r\nnoticeable that all her towns were built on some one of the three rivers;\r\nall the commerce of ancient Russia thus passed through her bounds.\r\nBesides Smolensk it is necessary to cite Mozhaisk, Viasma, and Toropets,\r\nthe capital of a secondary principality, the domain of two famous\r\nprinces--Mstislav the Brave and Mstislav the Bold.\r\n\r\n(2) The principality of Kiev, which was _Rus_--Russia in the strict sense\r\nof the term. Its situation on the Dnieper, the proximity of Greece, the\r\nfertility of its Black Lands, long assured to this state the supremacy\r\nover all other Russian principalities. To the south it was bordered by\r\nthe Nomad tribes of the steppe. Against the inroads of these tribes\r\nthe princes of Kiev were obliged to construct frontier fortresses;\r\nthough frequently they ceded them lands and took them into their pay,\r\nconstituting them into veritable military colonies. The principality of\r\nPereiaslavl was a dependency of Kiev; Vishgorod, Bielgorod, Tripoli, and\r\nTorlshok were at different times constituted into appanages for princes\r\nof the same family.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LAPLANDER]\r\n\r\n(3) The two principalities of Tcheringov with Starodub and Lubetz and of\r\nNovgorod-Seversk with Putivl, Kursk and Briansk, which extended along\r\nthe tributaries flowing into the Dnieper from the left--the Soj and the\r\nDesna swelled by the Seim. Tcheringov, extending towards the upper Oka,\r\nhad thus one foot in the basin of the Volga; its princes, the Olgovitchi,\r\nwere the most redoubtable rivals of those of Kiev. As for the princes of\r\nSeversk, they were ceaselessly occupied with wars against their dangerous\r\nrivals on the south, the Polovtsi. It is the exploits of a prince of\r\nSeversk against these barbarians which form the subject of a _chanson de\r\ngeste_--The _Song of Igor_.\r\n\r\n(4) The duplex principality of Riazan and Murom, another state whose\r\nexistence was maintained at the expense of ceaseless war against the\r\nnomads. The principal towns were Riazan, Murom, Pereiaslavl-Riazanski,\r\non the Oka; Kolomna, at the junction of the Moskva with the Oka; and\r\nPronsk, on the Pronia. The upper Don bounded it on the west. This\r\nprincipality was established in the midst of Finnish tribes--the\r\nMuromians and the Meshtseraks. The warlike character and the rude and\r\ncoarse habits attributed to the people of the principality doubtless\r\nresulted not less from the assimilation of the aborigines by the Russian\r\nrace than from the continuous brutal strife of the inhabitants with the\r\nnomads.\r\n\r\n(5) The principalities of Suzdal--with their metropolitan towns of Tver,\r\nSuzdal, Rostov, Iuriev-Polski, and Vladimir on the Kliasma; of Iaroslavl\r\nand Pereiaslavl-Zaliesski--which were established on the Volga and the\r\nOka, in the densest of the northern forests, surrounded by Finnish\r\ntribes--Mouromians, Merians, Vesses, and Tcherimisses. Though situated at\r\nthe extreme limit of the Russian world, these principalities nevertheless\r\nexercised great influence over it. We shall see their princes now\r\nreducing Novgorod and the Russia of the lakes to a certain political\r\ndependence, the consequence of a double economical dependence; then\r\nvictoriously intervening in the quarrels of the Russia of the Dnieper.\r\nThe Suzdalians were of the same character as the Riazanians--rude and\r\nwarlike. The characteristics of a new nationality were already noticeable\r\namong these two peoples. That which differentiated them from the Kievans\r\nand the Novgorod-Severskans, who, like themselves, were occupied in the\r\ngreat struggle against the barbarians, was that the Russians of the\r\nDnieper, sometimes mingling their blood with that of their enemies,\r\nbecame fused with Turkish tribes, nomadic and essentially mobile, while\r\nthe Russians of the Oka and the Volga united with Finnish tribes,\r\nagricultural and essentially sedentary. This difference between the two\r\nforeign elements which entered into the blood of the Slavs, without\r\ndoubt contributed to that marked difference in character between the two\r\nbranches of the Russian race. During the period from the eleventh to the\r\nthirteenth centuries, as colonization advanced, from the basin of the\r\nDnieper to the basin of the Volga, the divisions of Little Russia and\r\nGreat Russia were formed.\r\n\r\n(6) The principalities of Kiev, Tchernigov, Novgorod-Seversk, Riazan,\r\nMurom, and Suzdal, which formed the marches of Russia on the borders of\r\nthe steppe with its devastating hordes--constituting its frontier states.\r\nOn the confines of the northwest, opposite the Lithuanians, the Letts\r\nand the Tchuds, the same rôle devolved on the principality of Polotsk,\r\noccupying the basin of the Dvina, and on the republican principalities\r\nof Novgorod and Pskov on the lakes of Ilmen and Petpus. The principality\r\nof Minsk was attached to that of Polotsk. It was situated in the basin\r\nof the Dnieper and, owing to that circumstance, its possession was\r\nfrequently disputed by the grand princes of Kiev. The towns of Torzhok,\r\nVolok-Lamski, Izborsk, and Veliki Luki belonged to Novgorod; at times\r\nthey were the capitals of individual states.\r\n\r\nSouthwestern Russia comprehended (1) in the fan-shaped territory formed\r\nby the Pripet and its tributaries--Volhinia, with Vladimir in Volhinia,\r\nLutsk, Turov, Brest, and even Lublin, which is unquestionably Polish;\r\n(2) in the basins of the San, the Dniester, and the Pripet--Galicia\r\nproper, or Red Russia, whose ancient inhabitants, the white Croats,\r\nseem to have originated in the Danubian Slavs. Its principal towns were\r\nGalitch, founded by Vladimirko about 1444; Peremishl; Terebovlia, and\r\nSvenigorodka. The near neighbourhood of Hungary and Poland contributed\r\nto these two principalities distinctive characteristics, as well as a\r\nmore advanced civilisation. In the epic songs Galicia, the land of the\r\nhero Dvorik Stepanovitch, is a country of fabulous wealth. _The Narrative\r\nof the Expedition of Igor_ gives an exalted idea of the power of its\r\nprinces: “Iaroslav Osmomysl of Galicia,” cries the poet addressing one\r\nof them, “high art thou seated upon thy golden throne! With thy iron\r\nregiments thou guardest the Carpathian mountains, thou shuttest the gates\r\nof the Danube, thou barrest the way to the king of Hungary; at will thou\r\nopenest the gates of Kiev, and thine arrows reach far into the distance.”\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE UNITY OF THE PRINCIPALITIES\r\n\r\nThe disposition of these fifteen or sixteen principalities confirms\r\nwhat has been previously stated concerning the essential unity of the\r\nconfiguration of the Russian soil. None of the river-basins forms a\r\nclosed or isolated region; no line of heights establishes between them\r\nbarriers or political frontiers. The greater number of the Russian\r\nprincipalities belonged to the basin of the Dnieper, but pushed their\r\nlimits everywhere beyond. Kiev, with Pereiaslavl, is the only one\r\nstrictly confined within it; but Volhinia puts the basin of the Dnieper\r\nin communication with those of the Bug in the south and of the Vistula;\r\nPolotsk connects it with the basins of the Niemen and the Dvina,\r\nNovgorod-Seversk with that of the Don, Tchernigov and Smolensk with that\r\nof the Volga. Between these principalities, water-courses everywhere\r\nestablish communications. Russia, though divided into appanages, was\r\nalready making toward a great united empire. The lack of cohesion among\r\nnearly all the states and their frequent dismemberments prevented their\r\nbecoming actual nationalities. The principalities of Smolensk, of\r\nTchernigov, of Riazan never possessed that definite historical existence\r\nso characteristic of the duchy of Brittany or the county of Toulouse in\r\nFrance, the duchies of Saxony, Swabia, or Bavaria in Germany.\r\n\r\nThe interests of the princes and their ambition to provide an appanage\r\nfor each of their children, necessitated at the death of every sovereign\r\na fresh distribution of Russian territory. Yet a certain cohesion was\r\nevident in the midst of these vicissitudes. There was visible a unity\r\nof race and language, the more marked, notwithstanding differences of\r\ndialect, in that the Russian Slavs, excepting in the southwest, were\r\nsurrounded everywhere by entirely dissimilar peoples--Lithuanians,\r\nTchuds, Finns, Turks, and Magyars. There was also unity of religion;\r\nthe Russians were differentiated from nearly all their neighbours in\r\nthat, in contradistinction to the Slavs of the west, the Poles, Czechs,\r\nand Moravians, they represented a distinct form of Christianity,\r\nacknowledging no tie with Rome and rejecting Latin as the church language.\r\n\r\nThere was also a unity of historical development, since hitherto the\r\nRussian Slavs had all followed the same destiny, had equally accepted\r\nGreek civilisation, submitted to Varangian conquest, and pursued in\r\ncommon certain great enterprises, such as the expeditions against\r\nByzantium and the wars with the nomads. There was finally political\r\nunity, as among all--in Galicia as in Novgorod, by the Dnieper as in\r\nthe forests of Suzdal--the same family sat upon all the thrones. All\r\nthe Russian princes were descended from Rurik, from St. Vladimir, and\r\nfrom Iaroslav the Great. The civil wars which desolated the country\r\naffirmed anew this unity. No state in Russia could regard the rest as\r\noutsiders, when the princes of Tchernigov and Suzdal were seen to take\r\nup arms solely to decide which among them was the eldest--which held the\r\nright to the title of grand prince and to the throne of Kiev. There were\r\ndescendants of Rurik who governed successively the most distant states\r\nin Russia, and who, having reigned at Tmoutarakan on the straits of\r\nIenikale, at Novgorod the Great, at Toropetz in the country of Smolensk,\r\nfinished by obtaining recognition of their right to reign over Kiev.[b]\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE THEORY OF SUCCESSION\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A KORIAK]\r\n\r\nIf the question be asked why the Russian state continued undivided\r\nthroughout the two hundred years of the Varangian period, our answer is\r\nthat it was due solely to the fact that during the greater part of this\r\nperiod the grand princes left one son and heir. Whenever the case was\r\notherwise, as after the death of Sviatoslav and Vladimir, the brothers\r\nstraightway entered upon a struggle for mastery that did not terminate\r\nuntil all but one were destroyed. That one then became undisputed master,\r\nfor no one dared dispute the possession of power with the descendants of\r\nRurik.\r\n\r\nThe theory of succession in the Rurik family was as follows: the grand\r\nprince of Kiev was lord paramount of Russia. He disposed of all vacant\r\nprincipalities, and was supreme judge and general; but each of his\r\nbrothers had, according to his seniority, the right of succession to\r\nthe throne. The death of every elder brother brought the younger ones\r\na step nearer to that goal. The order of advance was from Smolensk to\r\nPereiaslavl, from Pereiaslavl to Tchernigov, from Tchernigov to Kiev.\r\nBut none could attain to the highest dignity, save him whose father had\r\nheld it before him. Sons of a father who had died before reaching the\r\ngoal were excluded from Kiev and were confined to the possessions in\r\ntheir hands at the time of their father’s death. The technical Russian\r\nterm for those members of the Rurik family who were excluded from the\r\nhighest dignity was Isgoi, and the attempts of the Isgoi to break through\r\nthe law of exclusion have had no small share in the bloody and desolate\r\nhistory of Russia during the period upon which we now enter. But another\r\nfactor contributed to the same end. The power of the grand prince was\r\nnot so predominant as to enable him to enforce his will and put down\r\ndisobedience. His position was based on the idea of patriarchal power,\r\nand was respected by the princes only when it was to their advantage. To\r\nmaintain himself he had to resort to the expedient of making coalitions\r\nwith some of the princes against the others, and the sword was the final\r\narbiter between the grand prince and his nominal vassals.[c] Accordingly\r\nthe whole of Russia was always divided in its support of the claims of\r\nthis or that candidate. The civil wars which ensued were after all but\r\nfamily quarrels.[a]\r\n\r\n\r\nCIVIL WARS\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [1055-1069 A.D.]]\r\n\r\nIaroslav left five sons. To Iziaslav, the oldest, he gave Kiev; to\r\nSviatoslav, Tchernigov; to Vsevolod, Pereiaslavl; to Viatcheslav,\r\nSmolensk; and to Igor, Vladimir in Volhinia. The order in which they are\r\ngiven here represents the order of their respective dignities and their\r\nposition in the line of succession. Two of the brothers did not long\r\nsurvive their father. In 1056 Viatcheslav died, and Igor, in accordance\r\nwith the law of succession, moved to Smolensk, where he too died in 1060.\r\n\r\nAbout this time a new wave of migration set in from Asia towards the\r\nsouth-Russian steppe--the Turkish tribe of the Polovtsi. In 1055 Vsevolod\r\nof Pereiaslavl concluded peace with them by bribing them to retire\r\ninto the steppe. In 1061 he suffered a defeat at their hands, but they\r\ndid not follow up their success and again retired into the steppe. The\r\ncivil wars, however, which soon broke out, were to bring them back as an\r\never-menacing plague to the Russian population.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SVIATOSLAV]\r\n\r\nAmong the minor princes, who were excluded from the succession, was\r\nVseslav of Polotsk, a descendant of St. Vladimir. He had helped his\r\nuncles in a war against the Torks, a tribe kindred to the Polovtsi, and\r\nexpected a reward in an accession of territory. Being disappointed,\r\nhe determined to help himself. First he ravaged the territory of\r\nPskov, but being unable to take that city, he invaded the territory of\r\nNovgorod, and it seems that for a while he was master of the city. His\r\nbold procedure compelled his uncles Iziaslav, Sviatoslav, and Vsevolod\r\nto unite against him; but, though beaten by their superior forces, he\r\ncould not be expelled from the north. The uncles thereupon resorted to\r\ntreachery. They proposed to him a friendly meeting under a guarantee of\r\nhis personal security and liberty, which they confirmed by an oath upon\r\nthe cross. But when he had reached the vicinity of Smolensk, beyond the\r\nDnieper, he was surprised, captured, and brought to Kiev, where he was\r\nimprisoned. At this juncture the Polovtsi made another of their raids\r\nand defeated the united forces of the brothers, so that Sviatoslav was\r\nobliged to take refuge at Tchernigov, while Iziaslav and Vsevolod fled\r\nto Kiev. There they intended to await the nomad hordes behind the walls\r\nof the cities, sacrificing the open country to the invaders. But the\r\ncitizens of Kiev thought differently. At a stormy meeting of the _vetché_\r\nit was decided to take up arms, and when Iziaslav refused to lead them\r\nagainst the enemy they liberated Vseslav from his confinement and made\r\nhim their prince (1068). Iziaslav was obliged to flee to Poland, where\r\nhe found a champion in Boleslav the Bold. Menaced in front by the Poles,\r\nand suspicious of his uncles in his rear, Vseslav thought himself obliged\r\nto flee to Polotsk, leaving the Kievans to the vengeance of Iziaslav\r\n(1069). The events of two generations previous, when Boleslav the\r\nBrave captured Kiev for Sviatopolk, were now to be repeated. The Poles\r\ndemeaned themselves as masters and committed many excesses. The Kievans\r\nbore it for a year; then exasperated, fell upon the Poles, who were\r\nscattered in their various quarters, and compelled Boleslav to evacuate\r\nthe city. After protracted fighting and negotiations, Polotsk was finally\r\nrestored to Vseslav, and the old order seemed re-established, when the\r\ntwo brothers of Iziaslav became suspicious of his designs and suddenly\r\nappeared before Kiev. Iziaslav now fled for the second time, Sviatoslav\r\nbecame grand prince, while Vsevolod advanced to the principality of\r\nTchernigov.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [1075-1078 A.D.]]\r\n\r\nIziaslav left nothing unattempted to regain his position. He had escaped\r\nwith his treasure into Poland, but Boleslav was unwilling to renew his\r\nformer adventure. The German king Henry IV, whom Iziaslav met at Mainz\r\nin January, 1075, was more favourably disposed and sent an embassy to\r\nSviatoslav; but it accomplished nothing. Iziaslav also entered into\r\nnegotiations with pope Gregory VII, to whom he sent his son Iaropolk. The\r\npope hoped to be able to annex Russia to the western church, and even\r\nwent so far as to grant it to Iaropolk as a fief from the holy see.\r\n\r\nBut meanwhile Sviatoslav died (1076) and Vsevolod, a man whose mild\r\ncharacter did not exclude the possibility of a peaceful settlement,\r\nbecame grand prince. Boleslav now lent troops to Iziaslav (1077), and\r\nthough Vsevolod marched against him with an army of his own, yet they\r\nsoon came to terms. Iziaslav was to be reinstated grand prince for the\r\nthird time, while Vsevolod was to retire to Tchernigov, in return for\r\nwhich he was secured in the succession. Thus Iaropolk’s plans came to\r\nnaught, and with them the hope of a reunited church.\r\n\r\nHowever, Vseslav of Polotsk did not yet give up his ambitious designs.\r\nFoiled in his attempt on the throne of Kiev, he tried to create an empire\r\nfor himself in the Russian north, and it required three campaigns of\r\nthe south-Russian princes to annul his plans. It was during these wars\r\nthat Vladimir Monomakh, son of Vsevolod and son-in-law of King Harold of\r\nEngland, first distinguished himself, though not in a glorious manner.\r\nHe was the first Russian prince to engage in a domestic quarrel the\r\nPolovtsi, with whose aid he ravaged the city and principality of Polotsk.\r\nVseslav died in 1101 as prince of Polotsk, and his memory lived long\r\nafter him in the traditions of the people, by whom he was regarded as a\r\nsorcerer. The _Song of Igor_ tells how he accomplished in one night a\r\nmarch from Kiev to Tmoutorakan, and how he could hear at Kiev the ringing\r\nof the church bells at Polotsk.\r\n\r\nRussian dynastic conditions had now been restored to the legal order,\r\nand there seemed nothing left to disturb the tranquillity. But the\r\ncupidity of the grand prince soon brought on new dissensions among the\r\nmembers of the house of Rurik. Viatcheslav and Igor died at an early age,\r\nleaving minor sons whom their uncle refused to provide with appanages.\r\nThey therefore tried to gain their right by force. Boris, a son of\r\nViatcheslav, temporarily got hold of Tchernigov, but being unable to\r\nmaintain himself in that city he fled to Tmoutorakan, the last refuge\r\nof all the discontented. There he was soon joined by his brother Gleb,\r\nwho was expelled by Iziaslav from Novgorod, and by another brother from\r\nVolhinian Vladimir, both of whose appanages were divided among the sons\r\nof Iziaslav and Vsevolod. In the civil war which followed, the nephews at\r\nfirst had the advantage and captured Tchernigov; but they were defeated\r\nin a decisive battle fought near that city on the third of October, 1078.\r\nBoth the grand prince Iziaslav and Boris fell, and Oleg was obliged to\r\nflee once more to Tmoutorakan.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Vsevolod_\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [1078-1093 A.D.]]\r\n\r\nIziaslav was succeeded by Vsevolod, whose reign (1078-1093) was even more\r\nunfortunate than his brother’s had been. He too favoured his own sons and\r\nthose of Iziaslav at the expense of his other nephews and in consequence\r\nthe sons of Sviatoslav and Igor and of his nephew Rostislav waged against\r\nhim unremitting warfare with the aid of the Polovtsi and Chazars, who\r\nwasted the country. Vsevolod’s attempt in 1084 to conquer Tmoutorakan,\r\nthe breeding-place of revolts, failed miserably. Finally even Iaropolk,\r\nthe son of Iziaslav, who had received so many favours from his uncle,\r\nrevolted against him and was assassinated during the war. In those days\r\nof turmoil and confusion, even old Vseslav ventured forth once more from\r\nPolotsk and plundered Smolensk. The grand prince was ill most of the\r\ntime at Kiev and the conduct of his affairs lay in the hands of his son\r\nVladimir Monomakh.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sviatopolk_\r\n\r\nVsevolod died April 13th, 1093, leaving two sons, Vladimir Monomakh, who\r\nheld Tchernigov, and Rostislav, who held Pereiaslavl. He was succeeded by\r\nSviatopolk, the second son of Iziaslav, who was the rightful successor\r\nafter the death of his brother Iaropolk, who, it will be remembered,\r\nwas assassinated. Monomakh could easily have made himself grand prince,\r\nfor he was the most popular of the princes and gained great fame in his\r\ncampaigns against the Polovtsi, whom he defeated twelve times during the\r\nreign of his father; but he was anxious to avoid violating the law of\r\nsuccession and thus inviting civil war.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SVIATOPOLK]\r\n\r\nSviatopolk’s reign began with a violation of the law of nations by\r\nimprisoning ambassadors of the Polovtsi, who had come to negotiate a\r\ntreaty with him. In retaliation the nomads invaded the country, and with\r\nso great a force that Vladimir and Rostislav, who had come to the aid\r\nof the grand prince, advised him to purchase peace from the enemy. He\r\npaid no heed to them, but the event soon justified the prudence of their\r\ncounsel. In the battle of Tripole, fought on May 23rd, 1093, the Russians\r\nsustained a disastrous defeat. Rostislav was drowned, while Sviatopolk\r\nand Vladimir saved themselves by flight. The next year’s campaign against\r\nthe Polovtsi was equally disastrous, and Sviatopolk returned to Kiev\r\nwith but two companions. Tortchesk was compelled to capitulate, and the\r\nnomads returned to the steppe rich with booty and prisoners. Sviatopolk\r\nnow bought peace and took to wife a daughter of the Polovtsian khan.\r\nThey returned, however, the same year under the leadership of Oleg, son\r\nof Sviatoslav, who had stayed till now in Tmoutorakan and thought the\r\nmoment opportune for enforcing his undoubted rights upon Tchernigov,\r\nwhich had been the original seat of his father as the second son of\r\nIaroslav, and which was held by Monomakh, who was the son of Iaroslav’s\r\nthird son.\r\n\r\nOleg, was therefore, no Isgoi and would not be treated as such. When he\r\nappeared before Tchernigov, Monomakh had only a small band with him, and\r\nafter a siege of eight days was compelled to evacuate the city and retire\r\nto Pereiaslavl, where he had to defend himself during the next three\r\nyears against continual irruptions of the Polovtsi. The refusal of Oleg\r\nto join in a combined campaign of the princes against the Polovtsi, and\r\nthe sudden capture of Smolensk by his brother David, gave the occasion\r\nfor a general war that lasted two years and covered the whole territory\r\nof Russia, from Novgorod to Murom and thence to the steppe, and in\r\ncourse of which one son of Monomakh fell in battle, while two other sons\r\nsuffered a decisive reverse at the hands of Oleg. Finally, a congress\r\nof princes was held at Lubetz, in the territory of Tchernigov, for the\r\nsettlement of all existing disputes. The result of its deliberations was\r\nthat the grand prince was to retain Kiev and Turov, while to Vladimir\r\nwere assigned Pereiaslavl, Smolensk, and Rostov; Novgorod to his son\r\nMstislav, and Tchernigov with all its dependencies to the sons of\r\nSviatoslav--Oleg, David, and Iaroslav. The latter thus gained possession\r\nof the greater part of Russia. There still remained to be satisfied the\r\nthree Isgoi, Volodar, and Vassilko, sons of Rostislav, and David, son of\r\nIgor. Of the former two, Volodar received Peremishl, Vassilko received\r\nTerebovl, while Vladimir in Volhinia was given to David. Polotsk remained\r\nin the hands of Vseslav.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [1097-1110 A.D.]]\r\n\r\nThe congress of Lubetz (1097) brought a respite to the sorely tried\r\nRussian north, but the south was soon subjected to new calamities.\r\nVassilko, son of Rostislav, was revolving in his mind extensive plans of\r\nconquest in Poland, among the Danubian Bulgarians, and finally against\r\nthe Polovtsi. He had begun making extensive preparations, and had taken\r\ninto his pay several nomad hordes. David of Volhinia, who was ignorant\r\nof Vassilko’s plans, became alarmed at these warlike preparations, began\r\nto suspect a conspiracy between Monomakh and Vassilko, and succeeded\r\nin inoculating the grand prince with his own alarms and suspicions.\r\nVassilko was allured to Kiev to attend a religious festival, and there\r\nhe was captured, thrown into chains, dragged to Bielgorod, and blinded\r\nin an unspeakably cruel manner. The horror of the bloody deed resounded\r\nthroughout Russia. Monomakh united his forces with those of his old\r\nenemies, the sons of Sviatoslav, and marched upon Kiev. The grand prince\r\ntried to clear himself of blame and throw the guilt upon David, and peace\r\nwas arranged through the mediation of the metropolitan of Kiev and of\r\nMonomakh’s mother.\r\n\r\nThe grand prince took upon himself the obligation to revenge the outrage\r\non Vassilko, who was surrendered to Volodar; and David was obliged to\r\nflee to Poland (1099). The grand prince annexed David’s territory, and\r\nthen turned, most unjustifiably, against the sons of Rostislav. Defeated\r\nby Volodar, he formed an alliance with Koloman, king of Hungary. The\r\nalliances now assumed a most unexpected and distorted character. David\r\nunited with the Rostislavitchi and with Buiak, khan of the Polovtsi;\r\nand at Peremishl defeated the grand prince and his allies. The war,\r\nthe horrors of which were increased by repeated raids of the Polovtsi,\r\nseemed to draw out without end or aim, when finally Monomakh convoked a\r\nsecond congress of the princes, which met in August, 1100, at Uvetitchi,\r\non Kievan territory. The result of its deliberations was that only a\r\nfew towns of Volhinia were left to David, the greater part of the\r\nprincipality being transferred to Iaroslav, son of Sviatopolk; while the\r\nRostislavitchi were to remain in the undiminished possession of their\r\nterritories.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [1111-1116 A.D.]]\r\n\r\nThus order was restored for some time, but the direction of affairs\r\nreally passed out of the hands of the grand prince into those of\r\nMonomakh. Under his leadership the Russian princes were now united\r\nagainst the Polovtsi, and there ensued a series of campaigns of which no\r\nclear account has come down to us. The Russians generally had the upper\r\nhand, but for a long time the balance wavered, and the enemy seemed so\r\ndangerous to the princes that, following the example of Sviatopolk, they\r\nentered into matrimonial alliances with him. Thus Monomakh, as well as\r\nthe two sons of Sviatoslav, David and Oleg, took Polovtsian wives for\r\ntheir sons. But the year 1111 witnessed a decisive campaign, in which\r\nMonomakh is again seen at the head of the Russian princes. After crossing\r\nthe Dnieper and the Vorskla, the Russians pressed on into the enemy’s\r\ncountry as far as the Don. Two Polovtsian cities were taken, and one was\r\nreduced to ashes; the Don was crossed, and on March 24th and 26th a great\r\nbattle was fought. The Russians were on the Sula, the last tributary of\r\nthe Don before reaching the sea of Azov, in a most unfavourable position\r\nand surrounded from all sides by the Polovtsi. But the scales were turned\r\nwhen the drujinas of David and Monomakh, which had been kept all the time\r\nin the rear, made a terrific onset on the exhausted enemy, who fled in\r\npanic. According to tradition, angels preceded the Russians and smote the\r\nPolovtsi with blindness.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Vladimir Monomakh (1113-1125 A.D.)_\r\n\r\nAfter a reign filled with civil war and misfortune Sviatopolk died (April\r\n16th, 1113), and all eyes turned toward Monomakh. Legally, however, the\r\nthrone belonged to his cousin Oleg, son of Sviatoslav, and Monomakh\r\nseemed at first resolved to recognise his superior right. But the Kievans\r\nwere determined to accept no one but Monomakh, and an uprising of\r\ntheirs, which was directed primarily against the Jews, whom Sviatopolk\r\nhad employed for fiscal purposes, but which threatened to assume larger\r\ndimensions, induced him to yield to the universal demand. Thus the\r\nrace of Sviatoslav--otherwise called the Olgovitchi--was excluded, and\r\nMonomakh succeeded in bringing a large part of Russia under his house.\r\nDuring his reign he continued the wars against the Polovtsi, as well\r\nas against the Finns in the north and east, and the Poles in the west.\r\nThe steppe was cleared so thoroughly that tradition, with its customary\r\nexaggeration, says that he forced the Polovtsi back into the Caucasus.\r\n\r\nHis relations with the Byzantine Empire have not yet been sufficiently\r\ncleared up. He himself was the son of a Byzantine princess, and his\r\ndaughter Maria was married to Leo, son of the unfortunate emperor\r\nRomanus Diogenes, who was blinded in 1071 and banished to an island.\r\nLeo then made an attempt at revolt against Alexius Comnenus, but was\r\npoisoned in 1116. Vladimir now espoused the cause of Leo’s son Basil\r\nand sent an army to the Danube, which returned without accomplishing\r\nits purpose. According to a later tradition, which arose under the\r\ninfluence of Moscow, the emperor Alexius Comnenus, in order to put an\r\nend to the devastation of Thrace by the Russian troops, sent to Vladimir\r\na diadem and other imperial insignia through Neophyte, metropolitan of\r\nEphesus, who put the diadem on Vladimir’s head and called him czar. But\r\ncontemporary accounts tell us nothing of all this, and it is inherently\r\nimprobable that Byzantium would bestow upon the Russian grand prince,\r\nwho was no longer formidable, a title whose exclusive possession it so\r\njealously guarded. On the other hand, it is known that in 1122, or six\r\nyears after the supposed campaign to Thrace, a granddaughter of Monomakh\r\nwas married to a prince of the house of Romanus.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [1122-1125 A.D.]]\r\n\r\nBut the greater portion of Monomakh’s military activity fell into the\r\nreigns of his two predecessors. He was in his sixty-first year when he\r\nbecame grand-prince, and he naturally avoided all fighting as far as\r\nit could be avoided, employing force only when requisite to maintain\r\nhis position as overlord of Russia. As far as circumstances permitted,\r\nhe was a prince of peace, and a number of most important legislative\r\nmeasures are attributed to him, especially the laws relating to usury\r\nand to the half-free (_zakupi_). Russia had suffered very severely from\r\nthe civil wars and the raids of the Polovtsi, and men of small property\r\nwere reduced to extreme poverty. Being unable to maintain themselves on\r\ntheir wasted lands, they went to live in large numbers on the estates of\r\nthe rich, who sought to reduce them to absolute slavery, or else they\r\nborrowed money at usurious rates and soon sank into a servile condition.\r\nTo remedy this ruinous state of affairs, Monomakh reduced the rate of\r\ninterest from 120 per cent. to 20 per cent., and decreed that one who had\r\npaid one year’s interest according to the old rate, was thereby absolved\r\nfrom his debt. He also ordered the expulsion of the Jews from the whole\r\nof Russia.[9] But the problem of the _zakupi_ could not be solved in this\r\nsummary fashion. According to the regulations adopted they were to be\r\nregarded as free men who had become bound to the soil by contract, but\r\nwho retained the right to acquire property and were not subject to the\r\nmaster’s jurisdiction. A half-free man loses his freedom only when he\r\nattempts to escape from his master. It was also fixed what payments and\r\nservices he was to render, and it was made impossible for the lord to\r\nreduce him to a condition of unrestricted serfdom.\r\n\r\nMonomakh died in 1125, at the ripe age of seventy-three. He has left us a\r\ncurious paper of instructions to his sons, which dates from 1117, and in\r\nwhich he gives them much sound advice, enforced by examples from his own\r\nlife.[c]\r\n\r\n\r\n_The “Instruction” of Vladimir Monomakh_\r\n\r\nThe grand prince begins by saying that his grandfather Iaroslav gave\r\nhim the Russian name of Vladimir and the Christian name of Vasili, and\r\nhis father and mother that of Monomakh; either because Vladimir was\r\nreally through his mother the grandson of the Greek emperor Constantine\r\nMonomachus, or because even in his tenderest youth he displayed\r\nremarkable warlike valour. “As I draw near to the grave,” writes he, “I\r\ngive thanks to the Most High for the increase of my days. His hand has\r\nled me to a venerable age. And you, my beloved children and whosoever\r\nreads this writing, observe the rules set forth in it. When your heart\r\ndoes not approve them, do not condemn my intentions, but only say: The\r\nold man’s mind was already weakened.” Having described in their chief\r\nfeatures, and for the greater part in the words of the Psalmist, the\r\nbeauty of the works and the goodness of the Creator, Vladimir continues:\r\n\r\n“O my children! give praise to God and love also mankind. Neither\r\nfasting, nor solitude, nor monastic life shall save you, but good deeds.\r\nForget not the poor, feed them; and remember that every possession is\r\nGod’s, and only confided to you for a time. Do not hide your riches in\r\nthe bowels of the earth: this is against the law of Christianity. Be\r\nfathers to orphans; judge the widows yourselves: do not let the strong\r\ndestroy the weak. Do not slay either the righteous or the guilty: the\r\nlife and soul of the Christian are sacred. Do not call upon the name of\r\nGod in vain; ratify your oath by kissing the cross, and do not transgress\r\nit. My brothers said to me: Let us drive out the sons of Rostislav\r\nand take their possessions, otherwise thou art no ally of ours! But\r\nI answered: I cannot forget that I kissed the cross. I turned to the\r\nPsalter and read with compunction: ‘Why art thou so vexed, O my soul? O\r\nput thy trust in God, for I will yet thank him. Fret not thyself because\r\nof the ungodly: neither be thou envious against the evil doers.’ Do not\r\nforsake the sick and do not fear to look upon the dead: for we shall\r\nall die; receive the blessing of the clergy lovingly; do not withdraw\r\nyourselves from them; do good unto them, for they shall pray to the Most\r\nHigh for you.\r\n\r\n“Do not have any pride either in your mind or heart, and think: we are\r\nbut mortal; to-day we live, to-morrow we are in the grave. Fear every\r\nlie, drunkenness and fornication, equally pernicious for the body and\r\nthe soul. Esteem old people as fathers, love the young as brothers. In\r\nyour household see carefully to everything yourselves, do not depend\r\neither on your pages or bailiffs, that your guests may not blame either\r\nyour house or your dinner. Be active in war, serve as an example to\r\nyour captains--it is no time then to think of feasting and luxury. When\r\nyou have set the night watch, take your rest. Man perishes suddenly,\r\ntherefore do not lay aside your arms where you may meet danger; and\r\nget to horse early. When you travel in your dominions, do not let the\r\nprincely pages be a cause of offence to the inhabitants, but wherever you\r\nstop give your host food and drink. Above all, respect your guests and do\r\nthem honour, both the distinguished and the supplicants, both merchant\r\nand ambassador; if you cannot give them presents, at any rate regale\r\nthem with food and drink, for guests spread good and evil reports of us\r\nin foreign lands. Greet every man when he passes by. Love your wives,\r\nbut do not let them have an authority over you. Everything good that you\r\nlearn, you must remember; what you do not know, learn. My father, sitting\r\nat home, spoke five languages, for which those of other lands praised\r\nhim. Idleness is the mother of vices; beware of it. A man should ever be\r\noccupied; when you are on the road, on horseback, without occupation,\r\ninstead of indulging in idle thoughts repeat prayers by heart--or the\r\nshortest, but best prayer of all, ‘Lord have mercy!’ Never sleep without\r\nbowing yourself down to the earth; and if you feel unwell, bow down to\r\nthe earth three times. Let not the sun find you in your bed! Go early\r\nto church to render morning praise to God: so did my father; so did all\r\ngood men. When the sun shone on them, they praised God joyfully and said:\r\n‘Lighten mine eyes, Christ God, and give me Thy beauteous light.’ Then\r\ntake counsel with the droujina, or judge the people, or go to the chase;\r\nand at midday sleep, for God has ordained that not only man but also the\r\nbeasts and birds should rest at midday.\r\n\r\n“Thus lived your father. I myself did all that could be ordered to a\r\npage; at the chase and at war, day and night, in the heat of summer and\r\nthe cold of winter I knew no rest. I did not put my trust in burgomasters\r\nor heralds, I did not let the strong give offence to the poor and widows,\r\nI myself supervised the church and the divine service, the domestic\r\norganisation, the stables, the chase, the hawks and the falcons.”\r\nEnumerating his military exploits, Vladimir thus writes: “My campaigns\r\nwere in all eighty-three; the other smaller ones I do not remember. I\r\nconcluded nineteen treaties of peace with the Polovtsi, took prisoners\r\nmore than a hundred of their chief princes and let them go free, and I\r\nhad more than two hundred put to death and drowned in the rivers. Who has\r\ntravelled faster than I? Starting early from Tchernigov, I was at Kiev\r\nwith my parents before vespers. We loved the chase, and often trapped and\r\ncaught beasts with your grandfather. How many times have I fallen from my\r\nhorse! Twice I broke my head, injured my arms and legs, without caring\r\nfor my life in youth or sparing my head. But the Lord preserved me. And\r\nyou, my children, fear neither death nor combats, nor wild beasts, but\r\nshow yourselves men in every circumstance sent from God. If providence\r\ndecrees that a man shall die, neither his father nor his brothers can\r\nsave him. God’s protection is man’s hope.”\r\n\r\nIf it had not been for this wisely written testament, we should not have\r\nknown all the beauty of Vladimir’s soul; he did not lay waste other\r\nstates, but was the glory, the defender, the consolation of his own, and\r\nnone of the Russian princes has a greater right to the love of posterity,\r\nfor he served his country jealously and virtuously. If once in his life\r\nMonomakh did not hesitate to infringe the law of nations and perfidiously\r\nslay the Polovtsian princes, we can but apply to him the words of Cicero,\r\n“The age excuses the man.” Regarding the Polovtsi as the enemies of\r\nChristianity (they had burned the churches), the Russians thought that\r\nthe destruction of them--no matter in what manner--was a work pleasing to\r\nGod.[d]\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Fall of Kiev and the Rise of Suzdal_\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [1132 A.D.]]\r\n\r\nIn the forty-four years that followed the death of Vladimir Monomakh, the\r\nover-lordship passed eighteen times from one hand to another, the average\r\nduration of governments being only two years and a half, and the dignity\r\nattaching to the grand princedom declined in rapid progression until it\r\nsank to a complete nullity. With this constant change of rulers, the\r\ndevastation and barbarisation of south Russia proceeded apace, so that it\r\nsoon ceased to be the centre of political life. A rapid review of these\r\nevil years will suffice for an understanding of the causes that brought\r\nabout this retrogression.\r\n\r\nWe have seen that Vladimir Monomakh reached the throne of the grand\r\nprincedom in violation of the superior right of the Olgovitchi. He\r\nsucceeded in bringing the greater part of Russia under his sons.\r\nMstislav, the eldest, held Kiev and southern Russia, while his sons were\r\nin Novgorod, Kursk and Smolensk; Iaropolk held Pereiaslavl; Viatcheslav,\r\nTourov; Iuri, Suzdal; and Andrew, Vladimir in Volhinia. On the other\r\nhand, the princes of Polotsk were independent; the descendants of\r\nRostislav ruled in Red Russia or Galicia; and the descendants of Oleg,\r\nin Tchernigov, Murom, Riazan, erstwhile the land of the Viatitchi and\r\nRadimitchi, and in the extreme southeast, Tmoutorakan. With union among\r\nthe descendants of Monomakh and with strong grand princes at Kiev, south\r\nRussia might have been able to maintain its ascendancy notwithstanding\r\nits unfavourable proximity to the steppe; but these conditions did not\r\nexist. Monomakh’s first successor, Mstislav, did, indeed, maintain his\r\nposition, and even annexed Polotsk, whose princes fled to Greece. But he\r\nsoon died (1132), and his successor, the brave but wavering Iaropolk,\r\nsowed the seeds of discord in his family by bestowing Pereiaslavl upon\r\nthe eldest son of Mstislav and naming him his successor. Therewith\r\nhe offended his own younger brothers, one of whom, Iuri Dolgoruki\r\n(Longhand), sought to maintain his right by force. The prince of\r\nPereiaslavl found support among the Olgovitchi, who were delighted at\r\nthe sight of quarrels among the descendants of Monomakh. One of the\r\nOlgovitchi, Vsevolod by name, raised himself to the grand princedom by\r\nutilising these quarrels (1139-1146). But immediately after his death\r\nhis brother was overthrown, and Iziaslav, son of Mstislav, became grand\r\nprince (1146-1154). Twice he was expelled by Iuri Dolgoruki, and only\r\nmaintained himself by making one of his uncles the nominal ruler.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [1146-1157 A.D.]]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A MORDIRNE WOMAN (ERGIAN TRIBE)]\r\n\r\nAfter his death the turbulence and confusion increased still further. His\r\nbrother Rostislav of Smolensk was expelled after one week’s reign by the\r\nprince of Tchernigov, who was expelled in his turn by Iuri Dolgoruki.\r\nThe latter might have shared the same fate, for a confederation of the\r\nprinces of Smolensk, Tchernigov, and Volhinia had already been formed\r\nagainst him, but for his timely death (1157). One of the confederates\r\nruled for eight months, and then he had to make room for his successor,\r\nwho ruled four months. In the eighty-three years that elapsed between\r\nthe death of Iuri and the capture of Kiev by the Mongols, the government\r\nchanged hands thirty times. How much the importance of Kiev and the\r\ndignity of the grand princedom had declined at this period, we can\r\nestimate from the refusal of Andrew of Suzdal, son of Iuri Dolgoruki,\r\nto take the throne, though he came next in the line of succession.\r\nHe rightly comprehended that the future belonged to the Russian\r\nnorth, rather than to the south, and it was his constant endeavour to\r\nconsolidate his power in that quarter; and when one of those powerless\r\ngrand princes, Mstislav Iziaslavitch, attempted to strengthen himself by\r\nforming an alliance with Novgorod, Andrew brought about a combination of\r\neleven princes against him. After a three days’ siege Kiev was taken by\r\nassault and plundered for two days (March, 1169), and Andrew’s brother\r\nGleb was then installed as grand prince of Kiev. The decay of the south\r\nis attributable chiefly to the following causes:\r\n\r\n(1) Its geographical position exposed it to the constant inroads of\r\nthe nomads of the steppe. This evil, it is true, existed from remotest\r\ntimes, but its seriousness was increased by the action of the Russian\r\nprinces themselves, who employed the nomads in their civil wars. Many of\r\nthese nomads, Torks, Berendians, and Petchenegs, settled on the Ros and\r\nDnieper, meddled in Russian affairs, and contributed to the barbarising\r\nof the country. (2) Every new grand-prince brought with him into Kiev\r\na new following from his own principality. These foreign elements\r\ncontributed ever anew to the unsettling of existing conditions, and\r\nprevented the growth of a landed aristocracy that had its roots in the\r\nsoil, and of a burgher class. The establishment of a political tradition\r\nthus became impossible. (3) The trade with Greece had greatly declined\r\nowing to the increasing dangers of the journey to the sea, and more than\r\nonce the princes were obliged to defend caravans to and from Byzantium\r\nwith their entire army.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [1157-1175 A.D.]]\r\n\r\nBut while the south was decaying, a new centre was forming in the\r\nnorth that was destined to gather around itself the whole of Russia,\r\nthe principality of Suzdal-Rostov. The city of Rostov, situated in the\r\ncountry of the Finnish Merians, was one of the oldest in Russia, and it\r\nis reported that Rurik had bestowed it on one of his warriors. Suzdal\r\nalso arose at an early date, at the latest toward the end of the ninth\r\ncentury. The early history of the region is not known to us, but we know\r\nthat Iaroslav founded the city of Iaroslavl, that it was temporarily\r\nunited to Novgorod, and that after the death of Sviatoslav II (1076)\r\nit was merged in the principality of Pereiaslavl. Vladimir Monomakh\r\nfounded Vladimir on the Kliasma, a tributary of the Oka, and built a\r\nchurch at Rostov. The congress of Lubetz assigned the entire territory to\r\nMonomakh’s sons, and Iuri Dolgoruki became the first independent prince\r\nof Rostov. Although this prince always looked to the south, yet the\r\ncolonisation of the north made rapid progress during his reign. We know\r\nthat three cities were founded by him, and the chronicle also attributes\r\nto him the foundation of Moscow in 1147. Suzdal was his capital. When he\r\nbecame grand-prince of Kiev he bestowed this whole country upon his son\r\nVassilko, while he gave Vishgorod, to the north of Kiev, to his eldest\r\nson Andrew.\r\n\r\nBut the latter had no liking for the south, and fled from Vishgorod with\r\na miracle-working image of the Virgin, which he deposited in a church\r\nthat he built at a place where he had a vision and which he called\r\nBogolubovo (God’s love). After the death of his father, in 1157, Rostov\r\nand Suzdal refused to obey his younger brothers and called in Andrew,\r\nwho was also joined by those of his father’s followers who had fled\r\nfrom Kiev. But it is most characteristic of the man and his far-sighted\r\npolicy that he made no claims to the throne of Kiev, nor did he establish\r\nhimself at Rostov or Suzdal but stayed at Vladimir, where there were no\r\nold families nor refractory citizens to deal with. His brothers, his\r\nnephews, the boyars of his father, he expelled from his dominions and\r\nmade himself sole ruler. In 1169 he gave Kiev to his brother Gleb, but he\r\ntook to himself the title of grand prince. To become the virtual master\r\nof the whole of Russia he only needed to subject Novgorod, and though the\r\ncombination of princes that he formed against it was routed before its\r\ngates, yet he ultimately succeeded, by cutting off its supply of corn, in\r\ncompelling it to acquiesce in his supremacy and to accept the prince that\r\nhe chose for it.\r\n\r\nThis first would-be autocrat of Russia also comprehended the importance\r\nof making the clergy subservient to his will. He tried to make his\r\ncapital Vladimir independent of Kiev in church affairs by establishing\r\nin it a metropolitan, and though he failed in his object, owing to the\r\ndetermined refusal of the patriarch of Constantinople, yet he succeeded\r\nin obtaining the important concession that in future the Russian\r\nmetropolitan was to be appointed only with the assent of the grand prince.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [1205-1221 A.D.]]\r\n\r\nHis despotic and cruel rule finally made him hated by his nobles, and he\r\nwas assassinated on June 29th, 1175, at Bogolubovo. After a period of\r\nconfusion his second brother, Vsevolod, became grand prince. During this\r\nreign the influence of Suzdal was still further increased, and the entire\r\nnorth, and even the Olgovitchi of Tchernigov, recognised his supremacy.\r\nIn the west and south, however, Roman Mstislavitch of Volhinia, who\r\nconquered Galicia and ruled temporarily at Kiev, offered a successful\r\nresistance. But after the death of the latter in battle with the Poles\r\nin 1205, Vsevolod conquered Riazan, and even deprived the Olgovitchi\r\nof Tchernigov, giving them Kiev in exchange. This prince, like his\r\npredecessor, attained his object by diplomacy rather than by the sword,\r\nand at his death in 1212 he was the most powerful prince in Russia.\r\n\r\nHis death was followed by a civil war between his two sons Constantine\r\nand Iuri. The latter, though the younger, was nominated by Vsevolod\r\nas his successor, but in 1217 he was beaten by Constantine and his\r\nallies--Novgorod amongst them--and compelled to resign the throne.\r\nBut Constantine died in 1218 and Iuri reigned undisturbed till 1237.\r\nHe fought with success against the Volga Bulgarians, and founded\r\nNijni-Novgorod (1221). But his power never became as great as had been\r\nthat of his father, and he exerted no influence in southern Russia, which\r\nwas devastated by Petchenegs from the steppe and by Poles and Hungarians\r\nfrom the west. All south Russia now lay exhausted before the impending\r\nirruption of the Tatars.[c]\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES\r\n\r\n[9] [They were during the Middle Ages the representatives of the\r\nmoney-power throughout Europe--a foreign element in the “natural economy”\r\nof that time. Hence the universal hatred against them.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III. THE TIME OF TATAR DOMINATION\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [1235-1462 A.D.]]\r\n\r\nIn the thirteenth century the steppes of central Asia sent forth a\r\nnew conquering horde, constituting the last wave of that migration of\r\npeoples which had commenced in remote antiquity.[10] This Mongol-Tatar\r\nhorde dominated Russia for 240 years and left enduring traces of its\r\ndomination. It definitively broke the bond between western and eastern\r\nRussia, and thus contributed to the formation of the principality of\r\nLithuania in the west; while in the east it promoted the rise of the\r\nprincipality of Moscow, which finally absorbed all the other Russian\r\nprincipalities, threw off their Tatar yoke, recoiled in its turn upon\r\nthe steppe, and finally, by turning Russia into an empire, made forever\r\nimpossible another invasion from the steppe.\r\n\r\nThe cradle of the Mongolian race was in all probability the country\r\nlying at the foot of the Altai Mountains. At the time of the appearance\r\nof Jenghiz Khan the Mongols were divided into numerous tribes, which\r\nwere governed by their elders and lived in mutual enmity. An unpleasing\r\ndescription of the exterior and life of the Mongols is given by a Chinese\r\nwriter, a contemporary of Jenghiz Khan, and also by Mussulman writers:\r\n\r\n“Their faces are wide, flat, and square, with prominent cheek-bones,\r\ntheir eyes have no upper lashes, their beard and moustaches are of scanty\r\ngrowth, their general appearance is repulsive. But the present Tatar\r\nsovereign, Temuchin (Jenghiz Khan) is of enormous stature, with broad\r\nforehead and long beard, and distinguished for his valour. They reckon\r\nthe year according to the growth of grass. When one of them is asked\r\nfor his age, he replies--so many grasses. When asked for the number of\r\nthe month, they laugh and reply that they do not know. The Tatars are\r\nborn in the saddle and grow up on horseback. They learn to fight almost\r\nby instinct, for they hunt the whole year round. They have no infantry,\r\nbut only cavalry, of which they can raise several hundred thousand. They\r\nhardly ever resort to writing, but all, from the commander-in-chief to\r\nthe commander of ten, give their orders in person. When they want to take\r\na big town, they first attack the small places in the vicinity, take all\r\nthe inhabitants prisoners, and drive them forward to the attack. For this\r\npurpose a command is issued that every man on horseback should capture\r\nten prisoners, and when this number is completed they are compelled to\r\ncollect a certain amount of grass or wood, earth or stones. The Tatars\r\nurge them on night and day, killing those who become exhausted. Having\r\nreached the town, they are compelled to dig trenches or fill up fosses.\r\nIn a siege the Tatars reck not of the loss of tens of thousands: hence\r\nthey are invariably successful. When they capture a city they kill\r\nall without sparing either young or old, the beautiful or the ugly,\r\nrich or poor, those who submit or those who resist. No person, however\r\ndistinguished, escapes this unrevokable penalty of death. The spoil is\r\ndivided in proportionate shares among high and low. This people have no\r\nneed of baggage or provision wagons; their herds of sheep, cows, horses,\r\nand other animals follow them on their marches, and they eat meat and\r\nnothing else. Their horses do not know barley, but they tear up the\r\nground with their hoofs and live on the roots. As to their faith, the\r\nTatars worship the sun at the time of its rising. They do not regard\r\nanything as forbidden, and eat all animals, even dogs and pigs. Marriage\r\nis unknown to them, but many men come to a woman, and when a child is\r\nborn it does not know its father.”\r\n\r\nSimilar descriptions are met with in the narratives of Europeans who knew\r\nthe Mongols in the days of their power.\r\n\r\n\r\nJENGHIZ KHAN; THE TATAR INVASION\r\n\r\nIt was among this rude nomad people that Jenghiz Khan was born in 1162.\r\nThe son of the chief of a tribe dwelling at the mouths of the Onon and\r\nthe Ingoda, affluents of the Amur, Jenghiz was far removed from the\r\nfocus of central Asian political life, and his power was originally very\r\nsmall. The first forty years of his life were spent in struggles with\r\nthe surrounding peoples; it is even said that for ten years he was in\r\ncaptivity with the Nyûché, or Chûrché (the Manchurian rulers of northern\r\nChina known under the name of the dynasty of Kin), during which time\r\nhe became acquainted with Chinese customs and manners, and also with\r\nthe weakness of the rulers of China. Having conquered various Mongolian\r\ntribes, he proclaimed himself emperor at a general assembly of the\r\nprinces, which was held at the sources of the river Onon (1206).\r\n\r\n“By thus taking the imperial title,” says V. P. Vasiliev, “he gave\r\nperfect expression to the purely Chinese conception that, as there is\r\nonly one sun in the heavens, so there must be only one emperor on earth;\r\nand all others bearing this title, all states having any pretensions\r\nto independent existence thereby offend the will of heaven and invite\r\nchastisement.” His successes in Mongolia are explained by his surpassing\r\nmilitary talent, the system of purely military organisation adopted by\r\nhim, and by the fact that he gave places in his service to all those\r\nwho were gifted, of whatever race they might be.[11] Jenghiz Khan’s\r\nconquests advanced rapidly; in 1206 he devastated the kingdom of Tangut\r\n(in southern Mongolia) and in 1210 he commenced a war with the Nyûché,\r\nruling in northern China. The war dragged on, and meanwhile the shah of\r\nKhuarezm (Bokhara) gave offence to Jenghiz Khan by slaying the Mongolian\r\nambassadors. Leaving his captains in China, the Mongolian khan marched\r\nto Bokhara (1219), whence, partly in pursuit of the shah and partly led\r\non by the passion for pillage, the Mongolian troops directed their way\r\nto the west, doubled the southern shore of the Caspian Sea, crossed the\r\nCaucasus, and penetrated into the steppes of the Polovtsi.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [1223-1228 A.D.]]\r\n\r\nThe leaders of these troops were Chépé and Subutai Bahadar. The Polovtsi\r\napplied for help to the Russian prince Mstislav Mstislavitch, and he\r\ncalled together the princes of southern Russia, amongst whom the most\r\nimportant were Mstislav Romanovitch of Kiev and Mstislav Sviatoslavitch\r\nof Tchernigov. The armies of the princes moved to the help of the\r\nPolovtsi, and although the Tatars sent ambassadors saying, “God has\r\npermitted us to come on our steeds with our slaves against the accursed\r\nPolovtsi; come and make peace with us, for we have no quarrel with you,”\r\nthe princes decided upon a battle which took place by the river Kalka in\r\nthe government of Iekaterinoslav. The Russian princes, who did not act in\r\nunison, were beaten (1223), and many were killed, amongst others Mstislav\r\nof Kiev. The Tatars did not penetrate far into Russia, but turned back\r\nand were soon forgotten.[12] Meanwhile the Tatar captains returned to\r\nJenghiz Khan, who, having definitively subdued Tangut and northern\r\nChina, died in 1227. He had during his lifetime divided his possessions\r\namongst his four sons: to the descendants of Juji (then already dead) was\r\nallotted Kiptchak (that is the steppe extending from central Asia into\r\nsouthern Russia); to Jagatai, Turkestan; to Okkodai (Ogdai) China; to\r\nTuli, the nomad camps adjoining the share of Okkodai. Over these princes\r\nwas to be exalted the great khan, chosen in a solemn assembly of all the\r\nprinces. In 1228 Okkodai was proclaimed great khan.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [1237-1241 A.D.]]\r\n\r\nAt first the question of succession, then the final consolidation of the\r\nempire in northern China, and then again the commencement of the war with\r\nthe south kept the princes around the great khan, and it was only in 1235\r\nthat Okkodai sent his nephew Batu, son of Juji, together with Manku, son\r\nof Tuli, and his own son Kuiuk, to conquer the western lands; to their\r\nnumber was added Sabutai, famous for his Kiptchak campaign. First of all\r\nthey conquered the Bulgarians on the Volga, and then came to the land of\r\nRiazan. Here they exacted from the princes a tribute of a tenth of all\r\ntheir possessions both in lands and in men; the courageous resistance\r\nof the Riazan princes proved unsuccessful, chiefly because the princes\r\nof northern Russia did not unite, but decided on defending themselves\r\nseparately. After the devastation of Riazan and the slaughter of her\r\nprinces (1237), followed that of Suzdal. Having taken Moscow, the Tatars\r\nmarched to Vladimir, where they slew the family of the grand prince,\r\nwhile he himself was defeated and killed on the banks of the Sit (1238).\r\nThence they were apparently going to Novgorod, but returned--probably to\r\navoid the marshes. On their way back, Kozelsk detained them for a long\r\ntime, but it was finally taken and pillaged.\r\n\r\nThe tactics of the Tatars in this war consisted in first encompassing\r\neach region as hunters do, and then joining forces at one centre, thus\r\ndevastating all. In the years 1239-1240 the Tatars ravaged southern\r\nRussia, and in 1240 they took and laid waste Kiev. All Europe trembled\r\nat the horrors of the Tatar invasion; the emperor Frederick II called\r\nfor a general arming, but his calls were in vain. Meanwhile the Tatars\r\nadvanced to Hungary (1241) and Poland, and defeated the Polish princes\r\nat Liegnitz in Silesia; and it was only the courageous defence of\r\nOlmütz in Moravia, by the Czech voyevod Iaroslav, and the gathering of\r\narmies under the command of the Czech king and the dukes of Austria and\r\nCarinthia, that finally caused the Tatars to turn back. They then founded\r\ntheir chief dwelling place on the Volga, where near the present town of\r\nTsareva (government of Astrakhan) they established a wintering place\r\nfor the horde--Sarai. There the Russian princes began to arrive with\r\ntribute. At first, however, they were obliged to go to the great khan in\r\nMongolia; for the first khans, Okkodai, Kuiuk, and Mangku, were lawfully\r\nchosen by the princes, and maintained their authority over all the\r\nempire of Jenghiz Khan; and it was only from the time of Kublai (1260),\r\nwho arbitrarily took possession of the throne and removed the seat of\r\ngovernment to China, that the bond was definitively severed.\r\n\r\n\r\nINFLUENCES OF TATAR DOMINATION\r\n\r\nThe domination of the Tatars over Russia is regarded by historians from\r\nvarious points of view: some (such as Karamzin and especially N. I.\r\nKostomarov) ascribe a decided influence to the Tatars in the development\r\nof Russian life. S. M. Soloviov, on the contrary, is of the opinion that\r\nthe influence of the Tatars was not greater than that of the Polovtsi.\r\nBoth these opinions are extreme: it is senseless to deny the influence\r\nof the Tatars, for the reason that Russia was long associated with\r\nthem, and that, since in her intercourse with the east, Moscow employed\r\nTatar services, much that was eastern entered into the administration,\r\nnotably the financial system; traces of eastern custom may also be\r\nfound in the military organisation. These are direct consequences; the\r\nindirect ones are hardly less important, because a considerable share in\r\nthe interruption of civilisation and the roughening of the manners and\r\ncustoms of the people may be ascribed to the separation of eastern Russia\r\nfrom western. On the other hand, it is impossible to regard the corporal\r\npunishments as entirely Tatar, for they were known in Byzantium, and came\r\nto Russia in the manuals of church statutes; they were known also in the\r\nwest, and are to be met with in places which were but little under Tatar\r\ndomination, such as Pskov. The opinion that the autocratic power had its\r\norigin in the domination of the Tatars must, it would seem, be entirely\r\nrejected, especially when we call to mind the constant preaching of the\r\nclergy, and the fact that John the Terrible directly appeals to the\r\nauthority of the Bible and the example of the Roman emperors.\r\n\r\nCivilisation and letters were almost unknown to the Tatars. The writers\r\nin their chanceries were for the greater part taken from the nations they\r\nhad conquered, as were also the artists who embellished the wintering\r\nplaces of their khans. Much luxury was to be met with amongst them,\r\nbut neither elegance nor cleanliness: in this respect they kept to the\r\nvery end the customs of the Mongolian steppes. Also in moral respects\r\nthey showed themselves dwellers of the steppes even to the end of their\r\ncareer in history. Cruel and coarse though they were, they possessed,\r\nhowever, some good qualities. They were temperate in their lives, and\r\ntheir cupidity was not so great as that of other Asiatic nations; they\r\nwere far less given to deceit in trade--in general, with them, violence\r\npredominated over deceit.[b]\r\n\r\nThroughout all of their conquests in Russia, they obviously acted upon\r\na principle which was well calculated to facilitate their own complete\r\nascendency. At first they destroyed the walled places that stood in\r\nthe way of their projects, and afforded a means of defence to the\r\npeople; they destroyed the population wherever they went, in order that\r\nthe remnant which survived should feel the more surely the weight of\r\ntheir power; and, at length, as their advance became the more safe and\r\ncertain, they relaxed slightly in their cruelties, enrolling under their\r\nstandard the slaves they captured, thus turning their conquests into\r\narmaments. But the climate of Russia rendered it an unsuitable place\r\nfor their location. As they could not remain upon the soil which they\r\nhad vanquished, they established themselves on the frontiers to watch\r\nover their new possessions, leaving nominal Russian princes to fight for\r\nthem against the invading tribes that continually rushed in. Those very\r\ninvasions served also to strengthen the Tatar yoke, by weakening the\r\nresisting power of the natives.[d]\r\n\r\nIn conquering Russia they had no wish to take possession of the soil, or\r\nto take into their own hands the local administration. What they wanted\r\nwas not land, of which they had enough and to spare, but movable property\r\nwhich they might enjoy without giving up their pastoral, nomadic life.\r\nThey applied, therefore, to Russia the same method of extracting supplies\r\nas they had used in other countries. As soon as their authority had been\r\nformally acknowledged they sent officials into the country to number the\r\ninhabitants and to collect an amount of tribute proportionate to the\r\npopulation. This was a severe burden for the people, not only on account\r\nof the sum demanded, but also on account of the manner in which it was\r\nraised. The exactions and cruelty of the tax-gatherers led to local\r\ninsurrections, and the insurrectionists were of course always severely\r\npunished. But there was never any general military occupation nor any\r\nwholesale confiscations of land, and the existing political organisation\r\nwas left undisturbed. The modern method of dealing with annexed provinces\r\nwas wholly unknown to the Tatars. The khans never for a moment dreamed\r\nof attempting to Tatarise their Russian subjects. They demanded simply\r\nan oath of allegiance from the princes, and a certain sum of tribute\r\nfrom the people. The vanquished were allowed to retain their land, their\r\nreligion, their language, their courts of justice, and all their other\r\ninstitutions.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A FEMALE SAMOYED]\r\n\r\nThe nature of the Tatar domination is well illustrated by the policy\r\nwhich the conquerors adopted towards the Russian church. For more than\r\nhalf a century after the conquest the religion of the Tatars was a\r\nmixture of Buddhism and paganism, with traces of sabaism or fire-worship.\r\nDuring this period Christianity was more than simply tolerated. The grand\r\nkhan Kuiuk caused a Christian chapel to be erected near his domicile,\r\nand one of his successors, Khubilai, was in the habit of publicly taking\r\npart in the Easter festivals. In 1261 the khan of the Golden Horde\r\nallowed the Russians to found a bishopric in his capital, and several\r\nmembers of his family adopted Christianity. One of them even founded a\r\nmonastery, and became a saint of the Russian church! The orthodox clergy\r\nwere exempted from the poll tax, and in the charters granted to them it\r\nwas expressly declared that if anyone committed blasphemy against the\r\nfaith of the Russians he should be put to death. Some time afterwards\r\nthe Golden Horde was converted to Islam, but the khans did not on that\r\naccount change their policy. They continued to favour the clergy, and\r\ntheir protection was long remembered. Many generations later, when the\r\nproperty of the church was threatened by the autocratic power, refractory\r\necclesiastics contrasted the policy of the orthodox sovereign with that\r\nof the “godless Tatars,” much to the advantage of the latter.\r\n\r\nAt first there was and could be very little mutual confidence between\r\nthe conquerors and the conquered. The princes anxiously looked for an\r\nopportunity of throwing off the galling yoke, and the people chafed under\r\nthe exactions and cruelty of the tribute collectors, whilst the khans\r\ntook precautions to prevent insurrection, and threatened to devastate\r\nthe country if their authority was not respected. But in the course of\r\ntime this mutual distrust and hostility greatly lessened. The princes\r\ngradually perceived that all attempts at resistance would be fruitless,\r\nand became reconciled to their new position. Instead of seeking to throw\r\noff the khan’s authority, they sought to gain his favour, in the hope\r\nof thereby forwarding their personal interests. For this purpose they\r\npaid frequent visits to the Tatar chief, made rich presents to his wives\r\nand courtiers, received from him charters confirming their authority,\r\nand sometimes even married members of his family. Some of them used the\r\nfavour thus acquired for extending their possessions at the expense of\r\nneighbouring princes of their own race, and did not hesitate to call\r\nin Tatar hordes to their assistance. The khans, in their turn, placed\r\ngreater confidence in their vassals, entrusted them with the task of\r\ncollecting the tribute, recalled their own officials who were a constant\r\neyesore to the people, and abstained from all interference in the\r\ninternal affairs of the principalities so long as tribute was regularly\r\npaid. The princes acted, in short, as the khan’s lieutenants, and became\r\nto a certain extent Tartarised. Some of them carried this policy so far\r\nthat they were reproached by the people with “loving beyond measure the\r\nTatars and their language, and giving them too freely land, and gold, and\r\ngoods of every kind.”[c]\r\n\r\n\r\nALEXANDER NEVSKI\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [1245 A.D.]]\r\n\r\nThe recognition of Tatar sovereignty was complete in the homage and\r\ntribute they demanded and received. Every prince was forced to solicit\r\nhis investiture from the khan of Kiptchak; and even when Iaroslav was\r\nestablished as grand prince over the rest, Batu cunningly allowed several\r\nrivals to put in their claims to that authority, and obliged them to wait\r\nso long for his decision that the order of succession remained unsettled.\r\nThis state of suspense in which the feudal lords were kept, and a series\r\nof famines which followed the destructive march of the Tatars, plunged\r\nthe country into a condition of abject wretchedness.\r\n\r\nDuring this period of indecision on the one hand, and forlorn imbecility\r\non the other, the Lithuanians succeeded in appropriating to themselves\r\nsome portions of the northwestern division of Russia; and the Swedes, and\r\nDanes, and Livonian knights of the sword proceeded to make demonstrations\r\nof a descent upon Novgorod. Alexander, however, who had succeeded his\r\nfather in that principality, finding that the grand prince was unable to\r\nrender him any assistance towards the defence of the city, anticipated\r\nthe advance of the intruders, and giving them battle on the banks of the\r\nNeva gained a decisive victory. He immediately built strong forts on the\r\nspot to repel any future attempts, and returned in triumph to Novgorod.\r\nSo signal was the overthrow of the enemy that Alexander was honoured by\r\nthe surname of Nevski, in commemoration of the achievement.\r\n\r\nFlushed with a triumph as unexpected as it was important, Alexander\r\nNevski desired to enlarge the bounds of his power at home. The army\r\nwas warmly attached to him, for his personal intrepidity was no less\r\nremarkable than his sagacity--qualities which were rarely so strongly\r\ndeveloped in so young a man. The Novgorodians, however, always jealous\r\nof their municipal privileges, and suspicious of the motives of their\r\nrulers, resisted the extension of Alexander’s power, and, apprehensive\r\nthat he would abuse his advantages, they remonstrated against his\r\nproceedings, and at last broke out into open rebellion. The proud spirit\r\nof the young prince was justly offended at the impetuous revolt of his\r\nsubjects, and he retired at once from the city, going over to his father\r\nat Vladimir, to request the aid of a sufficient force to restore order.\r\nBut Iaroslav, in the conviction of his own inadequacy, was unwilling\r\nto interfere with the wishes of the Novgorodians; and, conferring upon\r\nAlexander the inferior principality of Pereiaslavl, he sent another of\r\nhis sons, at the request of the people, to reign over the disaffected\r\nprovince.\r\n\r\nThe Novgorodians, however, speedily discovered their error. The Danes,\r\ninduced to speculate upon the absence of Alexander, a second time\r\nappeared within the boundary, and the new prince, an inexperienced young\r\nman, made choice of such measures as clearly proved him to be unfit for\r\nhis office. The people became dissatisfied, and, being now convinced that\r\nAlexander was the only man who could relieve them in their difficulty,\r\npetitioned him to return; but he indignantly rejected the request.\r\nA second embassy, headed by the archbishop, was more fortunate, and\r\nAlexander Nevski once more placed himself at the head of the army, and\r\nobtained a second victory over the invaders. Resolved to profit by the\r\nobligations under which he laid his subjects by resuming, at their own\r\ninstance, the reins of government, and by freeing them from the presence\r\nof a dangerous foe, he now pushed on to Livonia, and routed the combined\r\nforces of a triple alliance of Germans, Danes, and Tchuds, on the borders\r\nof Lake Peipus. This exploit, which the youthful hero achieved in the\r\nyear 1245, not only obtained him the love and admiration of his own\r\nsubjects, but speedily spread his name through every part of the empire,\r\nuntil it finally reached the court of the Golden Horde, where it elicited\r\nan unusual degree of curiosity and applause.\r\n\r\nIn the person of the prince of Novgorod, a new dawn of hope broke over\r\nRussia, and nothing but the disheartening feuds of the chiefs checked\r\nthe growth of that incipient desire for liberty which the influence of\r\nhis successes was calculated to create. Alexander was adapted to the\r\noccasion; and if the disunited sovereigns could now have consented to\r\nforego their low animosities, and to merge their personal differences in\r\nthe common cause, Alexander was the instrument of all others the most fit\r\nto undertake the conduct of so gallant an enterprise. But it required an\r\nextraordinary combination of circumstances to awaken the Russian princes\r\nto a full sense of their degradation, and to inspire them with resolution\r\nto set about the rescue of their country from the chains of the spoiler.\r\nAlexander’s example was useless. He could do no more than demonstrate the\r\npossibility of improvement within the reach of his own domain; but for\r\nall purposes of a national and extensive character, his exertions failed\r\nto procure any favourable results.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [1252 A.D.]]\r\n\r\nOn the death of the grand prince Iaroslav, whose reign appears to have\r\npassed unmarked by any events of importance, the khan invited or rather\r\nsummoned Alexander to the horde. A number of competitors or claimants\r\nfor the grand princedom had already brought forward their petitions:\r\nsome were lingering in person at the court; others were represented\r\nby ambassadors bearing rich tributes; and all were in a state of\r\nconsiderable anxiety pending the decision of the Tatar. Alexander\r\nalone was silent. The fame of his deeds had preceded him. He did not\r\ncome to supplicate for an honour to which he felt that he possessed\r\nan unexceptionable claim, but he attended as a point of duty, without\r\nreference to a nomination that could hardly increase his popularity.\r\nHis independent bearing, his manly figure, and the general candour\r\nand fearlessness of his manners gained him at once the confidence\r\nand admiration of the khan, who did not hesitate to assure him that,\r\nalthough he had heard much in his favour, report had fallen short of his\r\ndistinguished merits.\r\n\r\nAuspicious, however, as this reception was, it did not terminate in\r\nAlexander’s appointment to the suspended sceptre of Vladimir. The\r\npolicy of the Tatar was to keep the order of succession in periodical\r\nuncertainty, so that the Russians might the more distinctly see how much\r\nthe destinies of the country depended on his supreme will. It was not\r\nuntil Alexander paid a second visit to the horde, in 1252, that he was\r\nraised to the dignity of grand prince. It was accorded to him in a very\r\ngracious spirit, and he entered upon his new office with more earnest\r\nzeal than had for a long time before been displayed by his predecessors.\r\n\r\nThe first act of the grand prince was an expedition against Sweden,\r\nundertaken with two objects: (1) to crush a formidable foe that\r\noccasionally harassed the frontier districts; and (2) to give employment\r\nand opportunity for pillage to his numerous army, which he had already\r\ntaught to calculate upon the rewards of spoliation. The expedition\r\nterminated in victory. The triumphant army laid a part of the Swedish\r\nterritory under contribution, succeeded in capturing a number of\r\nprisoners, and returned home laden with spoils.\r\n\r\nThese successes and the skilful policy of the grand prince made the\r\nmost favourable impression on the mind of the khan, who now, whenever\r\ndissensions arose amongst the princes, either referred the adjustment\r\nof their differences to Alexander, or confiscated their dominions and\r\nannexed them to the grand princedom. Two instances of the latter\r\ndescription may be recorded as evidences of the cunning displayed by\r\nthe Tatar in the protection of the Greek religion. While Alexander was\r\nat the height of his prosperity, the prince of Kiev, affected by some\r\nsudden admiration of the Roman Catholic ritual, signified his submission\r\nto the pope, acknowledging his holiness’s supremacy over the churches of\r\nhis principality. Another prince, his brother-in-law, adopted a similar\r\nmeasure, which was equally offensive to Tatars and Russians. The khan,\r\nirritated by proceedings so directly at variance with his will, deprived\r\nthem of their authority, and transferred their territories to the grand\r\nprince, who, according to some writers, was even assisted by the Tatars\r\nin seizing upon them.\r\n\r\nThe tribute which had been originally imposed upon the Russians by\r\ntheir conquerors had always been levied by the princes, the khan being\r\nsatisfied to receive it at their hands. As the power of Alexander\r\nincreased, the khan gradually recalled this system of delegation,\r\nand adopted a more strict and jealous mode of collection. The first\r\ncontribution was raised upon the princes, as tribute money, and they\r\nwere left to procure it amongst their subjects as well as they could.\r\nBut it now assumed the shape of a tax on persons and property. In order\r\nto ensure the regularity of its payment, and protect the khan against\r\nevasions, Tatar officers were appointed in every district to attend\r\nexclusively to the rigid collection of the revenue. From this tax,\r\nwhich was imposed without distinction upon every Russian, and rated\r\naccording to his means, the clergy alone were exempt: and even they, in\r\none instance, were attempted to be taxed in later times; but the khan\r\nwho sought to enforce it was obliged to yield to the double argument of\r\nlong-established usage and weighty presents from the wealthy monks.\r\n\r\nThe new burthen lay heavily upon the people, and the mode in which\r\nit was enforced through foreign collectors, of the nation of their\r\noppressors enhanced its mortifications. Universal discontent followed\r\nthe tax-gatherers. They were treated with unreserved displeasure. It was\r\nwith great difficulty they could carry into effect the objects of their\r\nunpopular mission, and in some places, particularly the cities where the\r\npopulation was more compact, and the communication of opinion more rapid\r\nand complete, they were received with execration. This resistance on\r\nthe one hand no doubt produced increased severity on the other; and as\r\nthe levy advanced, the people became less cautious in the exhibition of\r\ntheir feelings, and the collectors more rigorous and despotic. Novgorod,\r\nwhich had always been the rallying point for the assertion of freedom in\r\nRussia, took the lead in this revolt against the khan’s authority. The\r\nNovgorodians, to a man, refused to pay the tax, and even threatened to\r\nwreak their vengeance upon the officers who were appointed to collect it.\r\nThe prince of Novgorod, one of Alexander’s sons, urged to extremities by\r\nhis republican advisers, sanctioned these declarations of independence,\r\nand openly signified his determination to prevent the exactions of so\r\nignominious a tribute within the districts dependent upon his rule.\r\nAlexander, perceiving, in this dangerous obstinacy of his son, the source\r\nof serious calamity to the empire at large, and knowing well that neither\r\nthe Novgorodians, nor any other fraction of the Russian people, were\r\nin a condition to resist the powerful armies of the khan, should he be\r\nprovoked to compel compliance at the point of the sword, undertook in\r\nperson to appease the growing tumult, and presenting himself in the city,\r\nrebuked the inhabitants for having perilled the safety of the country by\r\ntheir contumacy, severely punished rash advisers of his son, and finally\r\narranged the payment of the tax to the satisfaction of the Tatar offices.\r\nStill the Novgorodians were not content. They remonstrated against the\r\nunequal pressure of the tax, setting forth that it fell more grievously\r\nupon the poor than upon the rich, and that if they were obliged to submit\r\nto such a penalty, it should at all events be adjusted proportionately to\r\nthe means of individuals. Even this difficulty Alexander was enabled to\r\nmeet by assuming the responsibility of the payment himself, a vexatious\r\nand ungrateful duty, which, however, he willingly accepted, as it\r\nafforded him the means of quelling discontents that might have otherwise\r\nterminated in a sanguinary convulsion.[d]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Death of Alexander Nevski; Appreciation of His Character_\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [1263 A.D.]]\r\n\r\nIn 1262, disturbances arose in the country of Rostov, where the people\r\nbecame exasperated at the violence of the Tatar collectors of tribute;\r\na council was called together and the collectors were driven out of\r\nRostov, Vladimir, Suzdal, Pereiaslavl, and Iaroslavl; in the last\r\nmentioned town the enraged inhabitants killed the collector Izosim, who\r\nhad embraced Mohammedanism to become a Tatar tax-gatherer, and persecuted\r\nhis former fellow-citizens worse than the Tatars themselves. Naturally\r\nsuch an occurrence could not be calmly passed over by the horde, and\r\nTatar regiments were already sent to take the Christians into captivity.\r\nIn order to avert this calamity from the people, Alexander repaired a\r\nfourth time to the horde; he was evidently successful, possibly because\r\nof the Persian War which was then greatly occupying the khan Bergé.\r\nBut it was his last work; he left the horde, where he had passed the\r\nwhole winter, a sick man, and died on the way back to Vladimir on the\r\n14th of November, 1263; “having laboured greatly for the Russian land,\r\nfor Novgorod and Pskov, for all the grand princedom, and having given\r\nhis life for the orthodox faith.” By preserving Russia from calamities\r\non the east, and by his famous exploits for faith and country in the\r\nwest, Alexander gained for himself a glorious memory throughout Russia\r\nand became the most conspicuous historical personage in Russian history\r\nfrom Monomakh to Donskoi. A token of this remembrance and fame is to be\r\nfound in the special narrative of his exploits that has come down to\r\nus. “The grand prince Alexander Iaroslavitch,” says the author of the\r\nnarrative, “conquered everywhere, but himself was nowhere conquered;”\r\nthere came to Novgorod from the western countries a famous knight, who\r\nsaw Alexander, and when he returned to his own land he said: “I have\r\ngone through many countries and nations, but nowhere have I seen such a\r\none, no such king among kings and no such prince among princes;” and a\r\nsimilar honourable mention was made of him by the khan. When, after the\r\ndeath of his father, Alexander came to Vladimir, his coming was terrible,\r\nand the news of it flew even to the mouth of the Volga, and the Moabite\r\nwomen began to frighten their children by saying: “Be quiet, the grand\r\nduke Alexander is coming!” It happened once that ambassadors were sent\r\nto him from great Rome by the pope, who had commanded them to speak to\r\nAlexander as follows: “We have heard of thee, O Prince, that thou art\r\nhonourable and wonderful, and that thy country is great, therefore have\r\nwe sent unto thee two of the wisest of our twelve cardinals, that thou\r\nmayest hearken to their teaching.” Alexander, having taken counsel with\r\nhis wise men, wrote down and described to the pope all that had taken\r\nplace from the creation of the world to the seventh œcumenical council,\r\nand added: “All this is well known unto us, but we cannot accept your\r\nteachings.” Following in the footsteps of his father, Alexander gave much\r\ngold and silver to the horde to ransom prisoners. The metropolitan Cyril\r\nwas in Vladimir when he heard of the death of Alexander, which he thus\r\nannounced to the people: “My beloved children! learn that the sun of the\r\nland of Russia has set;” and all the people cried out in reply: “Then we\r\nperish!”[e]\r\n\r\n“It was as vassal and agent of the khan,” says Brueckner, “that Alexander\r\nbroke the resistance of Novgorod and compelled it to pay tribute. On\r\nthe one hand representing the interests of the khan and repressing the\r\nrevolts of the Russians, on the other hand mollifying the anger of the\r\nkhan and acting like a shrewd diplomat, Alexander represents a curious\r\ncombination of egotism and patriotism. We are not in the possession\r\nof sufficient evidence to form a just estimate of the measure of his\r\nservices or of his opportunistic policy, but he is certainly a most\r\ninteresting character in that unfortunate and disgraceful period of\r\nRussian history.”[i]\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Grand Princedom_\r\n\r\nWith the death of Alexander commenced afresh the hurtful contests of the\r\nprinces for the grand princedom. The division of interests which had\r\ngradually grown up amongst the Tatars, greatly increased the internal\r\ndisorders of Russia. Nogay, the Tatar chieftain, who had thrown off the\r\nrule of the khan of Kiptchak, asserted his sovereignty in the southern\r\nprovinces, and contended against his rival of the horde, for the right\r\nof tribute in many districts which had hitherto acknowledged implicitly\r\nthe government of the first conqueror. This strife between the ruling\r\npowers produced much treachery amongst the Russian princes, who generally\r\nallied themselves to the chief who happened at the moment to obtain\r\nthe ascendency, and who thus played a false game to assist them in\r\nthe accomplishment of their own individual objects. In this way they\r\nwasted their strength; for whenever a prince profited by the sale of his\r\nallegiance, he paid so dearly for the assistance which procured him the\r\nend he had in view, that the gain in such a case was usually discovered\r\nto be a severe loss. The grand princedom was the prize for which they all\r\nstruggled; and in the contentions which marked the struggle, almost every\r\ninferior principality became more enfeebled than before.\r\n\r\nAlexander Nevski was one of the few great men whose names stand apart\r\nfrom the tumultuous throng that crowd the early pages of Russian history.\r\nHe was a wise statesman, and a brave soldier. His victories over the\r\nenemies of his country were not less remarkable for completeness and\r\nbrilliancy, than his measures of domestic improvement were distinguished\r\nby prudence and foresight. The Danes, the Swedes, the Lithuanians,\r\nand the Teutonic knights severally gave way before him: he enlarged\r\nthe bounds of his territory, inspired his army with a fresh spirit of\r\nactivity, rebuilt several Russian cities that had been destroyed during\r\nthe Tatar invasions, and founded others in well-chosen situations.\r\nRussia, under his sway, might have redeemed her fallen fortunes; but\r\nthe unnatural hostility of the feudal princes to the grand princedom,\r\ntheir hatred to any chief whose virtues elevated him above them, and\r\ntheir ruinous conflicts amongst themselves upon insignificant grounds\r\nof quarrel, paralysed the efforts of Alexander, and deprived him\r\nof the power of rendering that service to his country which he was\r\neminently qualified to confer. His fame was so universal, that his\r\ndeath gave opportunity to the display of a fresh burst of superstitious\r\nfeelings. His approaching decease was said to have been notified to\r\nthe metropolitan by a voice from heaven; and as the body lay in the\r\ncoffin, the dead man was said to have opened one of his hands, as the\r\nprayer of absolution was spoken by the officiating clergyman. These\r\nmiracles obtained Alexander a niche amongst the Russian saints; and,\r\nless in honour of his real merits than his attributed powers, he was\r\nduly canonised after death. Some centuries subsequently, a monastery\r\nwas raised to his memory by Peter I, and his relics were removed to\r\nSt. Petersburg with extraordinary ceremonies of devotion. An order of\r\nknighthood was afterwards instituted in his name, which ranks amongst its\r\nmembers some of the monarchs of Europe. These facts connected with the\r\nreputation of Alexander Nevski in Russia are memorable, as proofs of the\r\nveneration in which he was held.[d]\r\n\r\nThe khans committed a serious fault in preserving a grand prince; it\r\nwas a still more striking one, and a consequence of the first, to place\r\nin his hands a sovereignty disproportioned to those by which he was\r\nsurrounded, to select him for too long a time from the same branch, and\r\nto give him armies to establish himself, and the means of seducing even\r\nthemselves by the most costly presents. The consequence of this was, that\r\nthe appanaged princes dared not enter so readily into a contest with the\r\ngrand princes, who were already more powerful than themselves, and were\r\nso formidably supported. Not daring to contend with them, they turned\r\ntheir arms against each other, and thus enhanced by their own weakness\r\nthe strength of the grand princes.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, till 1324, that is, for a century posterior to the Tatar\r\ninvasion, the power of the grand princes was doubtful; but then, amidst\r\nthe crowd of pretenders to the grand princedom, two rival branches made\r\nthemselves conspicuous, and the other princes of the blood resigned to\r\nthem an arena, in which the scantiness of their own resources no longer\r\npermitted them to appear. One of these branches was that of the princes\r\nof Tver; the other that of the princes of Moscow.[g]\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE GROWING ASCENDENCY OF MOSCOW\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [1303-1313 A.D.]]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MUSCOVITE WOMAN]\r\n\r\nMoscow becomes a princely appanage at a rather late date, although it is\r\nmentioned in the chronicle as early as 1147. The place is also called\r\nKutchkovo. With this appellation there is connected a tradition, which\r\nseems quite trustworthy, that Moscow had belonged to a certain Kutchka,\r\nand the chronicle also speaks of the Kutchkas as relatives of the wife of\r\nAndrew Bogoliubski and of his murderers. It seems that the first prince\r\nof Moscow was Michael Iaroslavitch, who died in 1248. Other princes are\r\nmentioned as having been at Moscow before that time, but it is difficult\r\nto decide whether they resided there temporarily or permanently. The\r\ntrue line of Moscow princes begins with Daniel Alexandrovitch [a son of\r\nAlexander Nevski], who died in 1303 and was succeeded by his son Iuri,\r\nthe famous rival of the Tver princes.[b]\r\n\r\nIuri married, in 1313, the sister of Usbek Khan. It was then that, after\r\nhaving excited the hatred of the Novgorodians, in persisting to subdue\r\nthem by means of the Tatars, Michael of Tver drew down upon his head all\r\nthe wrath of Usbek, by defeating Iuri, and taking prisoners his wife, who\r\nwas the khan’s sister, and Kavadgi, a Tatar general, who came to put the\r\nprince of Moscow in possession of the grand princedom.\r\n\r\nFor Usbek, after having preferred and supported the rights of Michael of\r\nTver to the grand principality, had changed his mind in favour of Iuri of\r\nMoscow, who had become his brother-in-law. The enmity of Usbek, however,\r\nremained suspended, until his sister, the wife of Iuri, and the prisoner\r\nof Michael, expired at Tver. Iuri then hastened to the horde, and accused\r\nMichael of having poisoned the princess. The offended pride of Usbek lent\r\nitself to this base calumny; he entrusted the investigation of the affair\r\nto Kavadgi; appeared to the summons; the vanquished passed sentence on\r\nhis vanquisher, whom he caused to be put to death; and the infamous Iuri\r\nof Moscow was appointed grand prince in the place of his murdered rival\r\n(1320). His triumph was short: being accused of withholding the tribute\r\ndue to the khan, he journeyed to the horde, and was assassinated by the\r\nson of his victim, who was himself immediately executed by Usbek. This\r\nvengeance restored the grand principality to the branch of Tver, in the\r\nperson of Prince Alexander Michael’s second son. It remained in it for\r\nthree years; but then, in 1328, this madman caused all the Tatars at Tver\r\nto be massacred. To the brother of Iuri, Ivan I, surnamed Kalita,[13]\r\nprince of Moscow, Usbek immediately gave Vladimir and Novgorod, the\r\ndouble possession of which always distinguished the grand princedom.\r\nThis concession formed, in the hands of Ivan, a mass, the connection of\r\nwhich Tver, weakened as it was, did but little diminish. Consequently,\r\nwith this power, and the troops that Usbek added to it, Ivan speedily\r\ncompelled all the Russian princes to combine, under his orders, against\r\nthe prince of Tver; who, after having undergone various misfortunes, was\r\nexecuted with his son at the horde.\r\n\r\nHere begin the two hundred and seventy years of the reign of the branch\r\nof Moscow. This first union of the Russians, under Ivan I, denominated\r\nKalita, constitutes an epoch; it exhibits the ascendancy of this second\r\ngrand prince of Moscow over his subjects; an ascendancy the increase\r\nof which we shall witness under his successors; and for which, at\r\nthe outset, this branch of the Ruriks was indebted to the support\r\nthey received from the Tatars. For as a word from the khan decided\r\nthe possession of the throne, that one of the two rival branches of\r\nMoscow and Tver was sure to triumph which displayed the most shrewd and\r\nconsistent policy towards the horde. It was not that of the princes of\r\nTver which thus acted. On the contrary they sometimes solicited the\r\nprotection of the khans, and sometimes fought against them; we have even\r\nseen one of them ordering the massacre of the Tatars in his principality.\r\n\r\nThe princes of Moscow pursued a different system; they no doubt,\r\ndetested the yoke of the khans as much as their rivals did; but they\r\nwere aware that, before they could cope with the Tatars, the Russians\r\nmust be united, and that is was impossible to subject and unite the\r\nlatter without the assistance of the former. They therefore espoused the\r\ndaughters of the khans, manifested the utmost submission to the horde,\r\nand appeared to be wholly devoted to its interests.\r\n\r\nNow this policy, which, at the commencement of the Mongol invasion\r\nacquired for Alexander Nevski the empire of all Russia, gave it,\r\nseventy-four years later, still more completely to Ivan I: for the sway\r\nof the Tatars was then more recognised; the Russians were more docile to\r\ntheir yoke; and the cities, which composed the grand principality were\r\nmore powerful in themselves, and also by comparison with the rest of\r\nRussia, which became daily more and more exhausted. The wealth of Ivan I\r\nwas another cause of the extension of his power.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [1323 A.D.]]\r\n\r\nThe complaints of the prince of Tver, in 1323, prove that Iuri I,\r\ngrand prince of Moscow, when he undertook to execute the vengeance of\r\nhis brother-in-law Usbek, against Tver, was also entrusted with the\r\ncollecting of the tributes; which, however, he retained, instead of\r\nsending them to the horde. Ivan Kalita, his brother and successor,\r\nprofited by this example. Thus it was, that by making themselves\r\nlieutenants of the khan, the Muscovite grand princes first became the\r\ncollectors, and finally the possessors, of the taxes throughout the whole\r\nof Russia; and thus they succeeded to all the rights of conquest enjoyed\r\nby the Tatars, and to their despotism.\r\n\r\nThere can be no doubt that one of the most copious sources of power to\r\nthose sovereigns was the periodical census and the perpetual imposts,\r\nso alien to feudalism, and especially to a feudalism of princes:\r\nthese imposts and censuses nothing but the Tatar conquest could have\r\nestablished, and they were inherited by the grand princes. Already, in\r\nthe first half of the fourteenth century, these taxes had rendered Ivan\r\nKalita rich enough to purchase entire domains and appanages,[14] the\r\nprotection of Usbek Khan, and the preference of the primate, who removed\r\nhis residence from Vladimir to Moscow, by which means the latter city\r\nbecame the capital of the empire.\r\n\r\nIt was by virtue of his authority as collector for the Tatars that Ivan\r\nKalita practised extortion upon his subjects. We see him requiring a\r\ndouble tribute from the Novgorodians, under pretext that such was the\r\nwill of the khan. Armed against the Russians with the dread inspired by\r\nthe Tatar name, and against the Tatars with the money of the Russians;\r\nintoxicating the khan and his courtiers with gold and adulation in his\r\nfrequent journeys to the horde; he was enabled, as lord paramount, to\r\nbring about the first union of all the appanaged princes against his\r\ncompetitor, the prince of Tver, whom he drove from Pskov and from Russia,\r\nbeing aided by the primate with the thunder of the church, then heard in\r\nthe empire for the first time. The nobility imitated the clergy. Impelled\r\neither by fear, or cupidity, several boyars of other princes rallied\r\nround this grand prince, preferring the fiefs of so rich and so potent a\r\nlord paramount to those of the petty princes whom they abandoned.\r\n\r\nIvan Kalita pushed forward with horrible vigour in his ambitious career.\r\n“Woe, woe to the princes of Rostov!” exclaims Nicon, “because their power\r\nwas destroyed, and everything was concentrated in Moscow.” In fact, from\r\nthe Kremlin, which he fortified, Ivan proclaimed himself the arbiter of\r\nhis kinsfolk; he reigned in their principalities by the medium of his\r\nboyars; he arrogated to himself the right of being the sole distributor\r\nof fiefs, judge, and legislator; and if the princes resisted, and\r\ndared to wage against him a war of the public good,[15] he hurried to\r\nthe horde, with purse in hand, and denunciation on his lips; and the\r\nshort-sighted Usbek, deceived by this ambitious monitor, was impolitic\r\nenough to disembarrass him of the most dangerous of his competitors, whom\r\nhe consigned to frightful torments. The prince of Tver and his son were\r\nthe most remarkable victims of this atrocious policy.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Lithuania, which, from the period of the first overwhelming\r\nof Russia by the Tatars, had emancipated itself from its yoke, had now\r\nbecome a conquering state. About 1320, Gedimin, its leader, seized on\r\nthe Russian appanages of the south and west, which had long ceased to\r\nbe dependent upon the grand principality of Vladimir. Kiev, Galitch,\r\nVolhinia, became sometimes Lithuanian, sometimes Polish or Hungarian:\r\ndriven to despair, their inhabitants emigrated; they formed the two\r\nmilitary republics of the Zaparogians and Cossacks of Don. Rallying\r\naround them the unfortunate of all countries, they were destined to\r\nbecome one day strong enough to make head against the Turks and Tatars,\r\nbetween whom they were situated; and thus to embarrass the communication\r\nbetween those two peoples, whom a common religion, origin, and interest\r\nconspired to unite.\r\n\r\nThe grand principality was, on the other hand, repeopled by unfortunate\r\nfugitives from the southern Russian provinces, who sought refuge at\r\nMoscow. The empire, it is true, lost in extension; but it was thus\r\nrendered more proportionate to the revived power of its grand prince, who\r\nhad also fewer competitors in it: those who remained could not, in point\r\nof resources, be compared with the grand principality. After all, it was\r\nmuch better that the latter should one day have to recover some provinces\r\nfrom a foreign foe, than from its domestic enemies: it was suffering an\r\nexternal evil instead of an internal one, which is the worst of all.\r\n\r\nThus, the macchiavellism of Ivan prospered. It is true that, by the\r\nconfidence with which he inspired the horde, and the terrible war which\r\nhe waged against his kinsmen, he restored to Russia a tranquillity to\r\nwhich she had long been a stranger. A dawning of order and justice\r\nreappeared under a sceptre acquired and preserved by such horrible acts\r\nof injustice; the depredations to which Russia had been a prey were\r\nrepressed; commerce again flourished; great marts and new fairs were\r\nestablished, in which were displayed the productions of the East, of\r\nGreece, and of Italy; and the treasury of the prince was swelled still\r\nfurther by the profit arising from the customs.[16]\r\n\r\nSuch were the rapid effects of the first steps which Ivan took to execute\r\nthe system of concentration of power; this great political impulse was so\r\nvigorously given, that it was perpetuated in his son Simeon the Proud,\r\nto whom Ivan left wherewithal to purchase the grand princedom from the\r\nhorde, and in whom he revived the direct succession. Accordingly, Simeon\r\neffected, against Novgorod, a second union of all the Russian princes.\r\nIt is to be remarked, that he was obliged to cede one half of the taxes\r\nto his brothers; but, at the same time, he reserved to himself the whole\r\nauthority, which soon gives to its possessor the mastery of the revenue.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [1353 A.D.]]\r\n\r\nSimeon having died without children, in 1353, after a reign of twelve\r\nyears, Ivan II, his brother, purchased the sovereignty with the wealth\r\nof Kalita. After the six years’ reign of Ivan II, this system and this\r\norder of succession were, indeed, transiently interrupted in the person\r\nof a prince, alien to the branch of Moscow; but we shall soon see the\r\ngreat Dmitri Donskoi establish them as fixed principles; that prince\r\ndid not neglect to increase the wealth[17] of his grandfather Ivan. The\r\npeople had given to Ivan the surname of The Purse; as much, perhaps, with\r\nallusion to his treasures, as to the purse, filled with alms for the\r\npoor, which is said to have been always carried before him. At a later\r\nperiod, the constantly progressive riches of the grand princes of Moscow\r\nenabled them to enfeoff directly from the crown lands three hundred\r\nthousand boyar followers; and next, to keep up a body of regular troops,\r\nsufficiently strong to reduce their enemies and their subjects.[18]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [1359 A.D.]]\r\n\r\nThis system of concentration of power which Ivan Kalita commenced, by\r\nmeans of his wealth, by the union of the sceptre with the tiara, and\r\nby restoring the direct order of succession; his horrible but skilful\r\nmacchiavellism against the princes holding appanages; finally, the fifty\r\nyears’ repose which, thanks to his policy, and to their dissensions,\r\nthe Tatars permitted Russia to enjoy; these are the circumstances which\r\nentitle Ivan to be considered as standing next after Alexander Nevski\r\namong the most remarkable grand princes of the third period. It was he\r\nwho had the sagacity on this stubborn soil to open and to trace so deeply\r\nthe path which led to monarchical unity, and to point out its direction\r\nso clearly to his successors that they had nothing to do but to persevere\r\nin it, as the only safe road which it was then possible for Russia to\r\nfollow.\r\n\r\nThis concentration of power brought about great changes from 1320 to\r\n1329; as, at that epoch, all the Russian princes in concert solicited\r\nfrom the horde the recall of the Tatar governors. It was then that,\r\nmore firmly fixed, the throne of the grand princes became the rallying\r\npoint of the Russians: along with the consciousness of their strength,\r\nit inspired them with a public spirit, which emboldened them. This good\r\nunderstanding was, in reality, an effect of the ascendency which a direct\r\nand sustained succession, in a single branch of the Ruriks, had already\r\ngiven to it over all the others.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Principle of Direct Succession_\r\n\r\nIn fact, sometimes natural justice, sometimes oriental negligence and\r\ncupidity, often the fear of being disobeyed, and lastly, and especially,\r\nthe power and riches of the princes of Moscow--whose presents always\r\nsurpassed those of the other princes--all these motives had induced\r\nthe khans to allow the succession to the grand principality to descend\r\nregularly from father to son in the branch of Moscow.[19] This natural\r\norder of succession Dmitri Donskoi, in 1359, established by a treaty,\r\nin which his kinsmen consented to renounce the mode of succession from\r\nbrother to brother. It was the most remarkable among them, Vladimir the\r\nBrave, who was the first to sign this act. In several other conventions,\r\nVladimir acknowledged himself the vassal and lieutenant, not merely of\r\nDmitri, but also of Vasili his son, and even of the son of Vasili, when\r\nhe was only five years of age. This example, set by a prince who, of all\r\nthe possessors of appanages, was the most renowned for his prudence and\r\nhis valour, was followed by the others. Thus, like the Capets, kings of\r\nFrance, did Ivan I, and particularly Dmitri Donskoi, begin the monarchy\r\nby restoring the direct succession, in causing, while they lived, their\r\neldest sons to be recognised as their successors. Afterwards we see\r\nVasili, son of Dmitri, persevering in this practice, and Vasili the\r\nBlind, his grandson, raising up his tottering throne, and preparing the\r\nautocracy of the fourth Russian period, by associating with himself his\r\nnext heir, the great Ivan III.\r\n\r\nIt is easy to conceive the infallible effect of this order of succession,\r\nand with what promptitude it must necessarily have extended and\r\nconsolidated the power of the grand princes. In fact, the ideas of the\r\nfather being transmitted to the son by education, their policy was more\r\nconsistently followed up, and their ambition had a more direct object.\r\nThe nobles could not fail to attach themselves more devotedly to a prince\r\nwhose son and heir, growing up amongst them, would know only them, and\r\nwould recompense their services in the persons of their children; for the\r\nnecessary consequence of the succession of power in the same branch, was\r\nthe succession of favours and dignities in the same families.\r\n\r\nEven before Dmitri had established the principle, the boyars saw the\r\nadvantages which this order of succession held out to them. Here, as\r\nelsewhere, the fact preceded the law. This was the reason of their\r\nrestoring the direct line in the grandson of Ivan Kalita; it was they\r\nwho made him grand prince at the age of twelve years, and who subjected\r\nthe other princes to him. In like manner, about 1430, they maintained\r\nthis order of succession in Vasili the Blind. Contemporary annalists\r\ndeclare that these ancient boyars of the grand principality detested\r\nthe descent from brother to brother; for, in that system, each prince\r\nof the lateral branch arrived from his appanage with other boyars, whom\r\nhe always preferred, and whom he could not satisfy and establish but\r\nat the expense of the old. On the other hand, the most important and\r\ntransmissible places, the most valuable favours, an hereditary and more\r\ncertain protection, and greater hopes, attracted a military nobility\r\naround the grand princes. In a very short time, their elevation to the\r\nlevel of the humbled petty princes flattered their vanity, and completed\r\ntheir junction with the principal authority. This circumstance explains\r\nthe last words of Dmitri Donskoi to his boyars, when he recommended his\r\nson to their protection. “Under my reign,” said he, “you were not boyars,\r\nbut really Russian princes.” In fact (to cite only some examples), we\r\nsee that his armies were as often commanded by boyars as by princes, and\r\nthat, from this epoch, it was no longer a prince of the blood, but a\r\nboyar of the grand prince, who was his lieutenant at Novgorod.\r\n\r\nNay, more, when the succession from father to son was once established,\r\nthere were, at the very beginning, two minorities (those of Dmitri, and\r\nof Vasili, his grandson), during which the boyars composed the council of\r\nregency, governed the state, and were the equals, and even the superiors,\r\nof the princes who held appanages. This will explain why, in 1392, the\r\nboyars of Boris, the last prince of Suzdal, gave up him and his appanage\r\nto Vasili Dmitrievitch of Moscow. The motive is to be found only in\r\ntheir interest; as the grand prince of Moscow entrusted them with the\r\ngovernment of the appanages, and thus substituted the nobles in the place\r\nof the princes.\r\n\r\nA very remarkable circumstance, with respect to Dmitri Donskoi, is, on\r\nthe one hand, the energy with which he subdued those princes, and, on the\r\nother, his circumspect treatment of his boyars. According to Karamsin,\r\nit is more especially to their pride and jealousy of the tyssiatchsky of\r\nMoscow (the boyar of the city, or of the commune, a sort of civil and\r\nmilitary tribune, elected by the people), that we are to attribute the\r\nabolition of that office by Donskoi. During the preceding reign, another\r\ntyssiatchsky of Moscow, who claimed precedence of even the boyars of the\r\ngrand prince, had been murdered by them.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DMITRI DONSKOI]\r\n\r\nWhen this hereditary protection afforded by the grand princes of the\r\nMoscow branch was once fairly established, the nobles of each appanage,\r\nwho constituted its army, had thenceforth an asylum, and, as it were,\r\na tribunal for redress, to which they could appeal whenever they were\r\ndissatisfied with their prince. It was this which made Tver fall before\r\nIvan Kalita; for the sovereign prince of that first and last rival of\r\nMoscow having preferred to his boyars the people of Pskov, who had\r\ndefended him, the former withdrew to Moscow.\r\n\r\nThe power of Ivan Kalita being once raised by the Tatars’ aid, and by\r\nthe re-establishment of the direct line of succession, and thoroughly\r\ndeveloped by his son and grandson, Simeon the Proud and Dmitri Donskoi,\r\nit followed, as a natural consequence, that he who was most able to\r\nreward and to punish drew around him, and retained, the whole of the\r\nnobles. These constituted the sole strength of the appanaged princes;\r\ntheir defection, therefore, completed the subjugation of the princes.\r\nDmitri Donskoi was, therefore, in reality sovereign, as is proved by his\r\ntreaties with the princes who held appanages, all of whom he reduced to\r\nbe his vassals. And, accordingly, notwithstanding the appanages which he\r\ngave to his sons, and the dissensions which arose out of that error--an\r\nerror as yet, perhaps, unavoidable--the attachment of the nobles, for\r\nwhich we have just assigned a reason, always replaced the legitimate heir\r\non the throne.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [1366 A.D.]]\r\n\r\nAlready, so early as about 1366, the Russian princes could no longer\r\nventure to contend against their lord paramount by any other means than\r\nby denunciations to the horde; but to what khan could they be addressed?\r\nDiscord had created several: what result was to be hoped from them?\r\nDivided among themselves, the Tatar armies had ceased to be an available\r\nforce. The journeys to the Golden Horde, which had originally contributed\r\nto keep the Russian princes in awe, now served to afford them an insight\r\ninto the weakness of their enemies. The grand princes returned from the\r\nhorde with the confidence that they might usurp with impunity; and their\r\ncompetitors with envoys and letters, which even they themselves well\r\nknew would be of no avail. It was, then, obvious in Russia, that the\r\nonly protecting power was at Moscow: to have recourse to its support was\r\na matter of necessity. The petty princes could obtain it only by the\r\nsacrifice of their independence; and thus all of them became vassals to\r\nthe grand prince Dmitri.\r\n\r\nNever did a great man arise more opportunely than this Dmitri. It was\r\na propitious circumstance, that the dissensions of the Tatars gave\r\nthem full occupation during the eighteen years subsequent to the first\r\nthree of his reign:[20] this, in the first place, allowed him time to\r\nextinguish the devastating fury of Olgerd the Lithuanian, son of Gedimin,\r\nfather of Iagello, and conqueror of all Lithuania, Volhinia, Smolensk,\r\nKiev, and even of Taurida; secondly, to unite several principalities with\r\nhis throne; and lastly, to compel the other princes, and even the prince\r\nof Tver, to acknowledge his paramount authority.\r\n\r\nThe contest with the latter was terrible: four times did Dmitri overcome\r\nMichael, and four times did the prince of Tver, aided by his son-in-law,\r\nthe great Olgerd, prince of Lithuania, rise again victorious. In this\r\nobstinate conflict, Moscow itself was twice besieged, and must have\r\nfallen, had it not been for its stone walls, the recent work of the\r\nfirst regency of the Muscovite boyars. But, at length, Olgerd died; and\r\nDmitri, who, but three years before, could appear only on his knees at\r\nthe horde, now dared to refuse the khan his tribute, and to put to death\r\nthe insolent ambassador who had been sent to claim it.\r\n\r\nWe have seen that, fifty years earlier, a similar instance of temerity\r\ncaused the branch of Tver to fall beneath that of Moscow; but times\r\nwere changed. The triple alliance of the primate, the boyars, and the\r\ngrand prince, had now restored to the Russians a confidence in their own\r\nstrength: they had acquired boldness from a conviction of the power of\r\ntheir grand prince, and from the dissensions of the Tatars. Some bands\r\nof the latter, wandering in Muscovy in search of plunder, were defeated;\r\nat last the Tatars have fled before the Russians! they are become their\r\nslaves, the delusion of their invincibility is no more!\r\n\r\nThe burst of fury which the khan exhibited on learning the murder of his\r\nrepresentative, accordingly served as a signal for the confederation of\r\nall the Russian princes against the prince of Tver. He was compelled to\r\nsubmit to the grand prince, and to join with him against the horde.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Battle of the Don or Kulikovo (1380 A.D.)_\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [1380 A.D.]]\r\n\r\nRussia now began to feel that there were three things which were\r\nindispensably necessary to her; the establishment of the direct\r\nsuccession, the concentration of the supreme power, and the union of all\r\nparties against the Tatars. The movement in this direction was taken very\r\nopportunely; for it happened simultaneously that the Mongolian chief,\r\nMamai, was also disembarrassed of his civil wars (1380), and he hastened\r\nwith all his forces into Russia to re-establish his slighted authority;\r\nbut he found the grand prince Dmitri confronting him on the Don, at\r\nthe head of the combined Russian princes and an army of two hundred\r\nthousand[21] men. Dmitri put it to the choice of his troops whether they\r\nwould go to encounter the foe, who were encamped at no great distance\r\non the opposite shore of the river, or remain on this side and wait the\r\nattack? With one voice they declared for going over to the assault. The\r\ngrand prince immediately transported his battalions across the river,\r\nand then turned the vessels adrift, in order to cut off all hopes of\r\nescaping by retreat, and inspire his men with a more desperate valour\r\nagainst an enemy who was three times stronger in numbers. The fight\r\nbegan. The Russians defended themselves valiantly against the furious\r\nattacks of the Tatars; the hosts of combatants pressed in such numbers to\r\nthe field of battle, that multitudes of them were trampled under foot by\r\nthe tumult of men and horses. The Tatars, continually relieved by fresh\r\nbodies of soldiers as any part was fatigued by the conflict, seemed at\r\nlength to have victory on their side. Nothing but the impossibility of\r\ngetting over the river, and the firm persuasion that death would directly\r\ntransport them from the hands of the infidel enemy into the mansions of\r\nbliss, restrained the Russians from a general flight. But all at once,\r\nat the very moment when everything seemed to be lost, a detachment of\r\nthe grand prince’s army, which he had stationed as a reserve, and which\r\ntill now had remained inactive and unobserved, came up in full force,\r\nfell upon the rear of the Tatars, and threw them into such amazement and\r\nterror that they fled, and left the Russians masters of the field. This\r\nmomentous victory, however, cost them dear; thousands lay dead upon the\r\nground, and the whole army was occupied eight days in burying the bodies\r\nof the dead Russians: those of the Tatars were left uninterred upon the\r\nground. It was in harmony of this achievement that Dmitri received his\r\nhonourable surname of Donskoi.[g]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Significance of Battle of Kulikovo_\r\n\r\nThe chronicles say that such a battle as that of Kulikovo had never\r\nbefore been known in Russia; even Europe had not seen the like of it for\r\na long time. Such bloody conflicts had taken place in the western half\r\nof Europe at the beginning of the so-called Middle Ages, at the time of\r\nthe great migration of nations, in those terrible collisions between\r\nEuropean and Asiatic armies; such was the battle of Châlons-sur-Marne,\r\nwhen the Roman general saved western Europe from the Huns; such too was\r\nthe battle of Tours, where the Frankish leader saved western Europe\r\nfrom the Arabs (Saracens). Western Europe was saved from the Asiatics,\r\nbut her eastern half remained long open to their attacks. Here, about\r\nthe middle of the ninth century, was formed an empire which should have\r\nserved Europe as a bulwark against Asia; in the thirteenth century this\r\nbulwark was seemingly destroyed, but the foundations of the European\r\nempire were saved in the distant northwest; thanks to the preservation of\r\nthese foundations, in a hundred and fifty years the empire succeeded in\r\nbecoming unified, consolidated--and the victory of Kulikovo served as a\r\nproof of its strength. It was an omen of the triumph of Europe over Asia,\r\nand has exactly the same signification in the history of eastern Europe\r\nas the victories of Châlons and Tours have in that of western Europe.\r\nIt also bears a like character with them--that of a terrible, bloody\r\nslaughter, a desperate struggle between Europe and Asia, which was to\r\ndecide the great question in the history of humanity: which of these two\r\nparts of the world was to triumph over the other.\r\n\r\nBut the victory of Kulikovo was one of those victories which closely\r\nborder upon grievous defeats. When, says the tradition, the grand prince\r\nordered a count to be made of those who were left alive after the battle,\r\nthe boyar Michael Aleksandrovitch reported to him that there remained in\r\nall forty thousand men, while more than four hundred thousand had been in\r\naction. And although the historian is not obliged to accept the latter\r\nstatement literally, yet the ratio here given between the living and the\r\ndead is of great importance to him. Four princes, thirteen boyars, and a\r\nmonk of the monastery of Troitsa, were among the slain. It is for this\r\nreason that in the embellished narratives of the defeat of Mamai we see\r\nthe event represented on one hand as a great triumph and on the other\r\nas a woeful and lamentable event. There was great joy in Russia, says\r\nthe chronicler, but there was also great grief over those slain by Mamai\r\nat the Don; the land of Russia was bereft of all voyevods (captains)\r\nand men and all kinds of warriors, and therefore there was a great fear\r\nthroughout all the land of Russia. It was this depopulation through loss\r\nof men that gave the Tatars a short-lived triumph over the victors of\r\nKulikovo.[e]\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE DESTRUCTION OF MOSCOW (1382 A.D.)\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [1382 A.D.]]\r\n\r\nThe immediate and inevitable consequence of the battle was a sensible\r\nreduction of the Russian army. The numbers that fell before the Tatars\r\ncould not be easily or speedily supplied: nor were the means of a\r\nfresh levy accessible. Those districts from which the grand army was\r\nordinarily recruited had already exhausted their population; all the\r\nremote principalities had contributed in nearly equal proportion, and\r\nthe majority of the rest of the empire was composed of persons who\r\nwere unaccustomed to the use of arms, having been exclusively occupied\r\nin tillage or commerce. These circumstances, which did not damp the\r\njoy of the victory, or diminish its real importance, presented to the\r\nimplacable foe a new temptation for crossing the border. But it was\r\nnot until two of the wandering hordes had formed a junction that the\r\nTatars were able to undertake the enterprise. The preparations for it\r\noccupied them two years. In 1382, the hordes of the Don and the Volga\r\nunited, and making a descent upon the frontier provinces with success,\r\npenetrated as far as Moscow. The city had been previously fortified by\r\nthe boyars with strong ramparts and iron gates; and Dmitri, trusting with\r\nconfidence to the invincibility of the fortifications, left the capital\r\nin the charge of one of his generals, while he imprudently went into the\r\ninterior to recruit his army. His absence in the hour of danger spread\r\nconsternation amongst the peaceable part of the inhabitants, particularly\r\nthe clergy, who relied upon his energies on the most trying occasions.\r\nThe metropolitan, accompanied by a great number of the citizens, left the\r\ncity upon the approach of the Tatars. The small garrison that remained\r\nmade an ineffectual show on the ramparts, and the Tatars, who might not\r\notherwise have gained their object, prevailed upon the timidity of the\r\nRussians, who consented to capitulate upon a promise of pardon. The\r\nTatars observed their pledge in this instance as they had done in every\r\nsimilar case--by availing themselves of the first opportunity to violate\r\nit. They no sooner entered Moscow than they gave it to the flames, and\r\nmassacred every living person they met in the streets. Having glutted\r\ntheir revenge with a terrible scene of slaughter and conflagration, they\r\nreturned home, satisfied with having reduced the grand princedom once\r\nmore, after their own fashion, to subjection. They did not perceive that\r\nin this exercise of brutal rage they strengthened the moral power of\r\nRussia, by giving an increased motive to co-operation, and by rendering\r\nthe abhorrence of their yoke still more bitter than before. All they\r\ndesired was the physical and visible evidence of superiority; either not\r\nheeding, or not comprehending, the silent and unseen progress of that\r\nstrength which combined opinion acquires under the pressure of blind\r\ntyranny.\r\n\r\nDmitri, thus reduced to submission, was compelled once more to perform\r\nthe humiliating penance of begging his dignity at the hands of the khan.\r\nEmpire had just been within his grasp; he had bound up the shattered\r\nparts of the great mass; he had effected a union of sentiment, and a bond\r\nof co-operation; but in the effort to establish this desirable end, he\r\nhad exhausted the means by which alone it could be perpetuated. Had the\r\nTatars suffered a short period more to have elapsed before they resumed\r\nthe work of spoliation, it is not improbable but that a sufficient force\r\ncould have been raised to repel them: but they appeared in considerable\r\nnumbers, animated by the wildest passions, at a time when Dmitri was\r\nunable to make head against their approach. The result was unavoidable;\r\nand the grand prince, in suing to be reinstated on the throne from which\r\nhe was virtually expelled, merely acquiesced in a necessity which he\r\ncould not avert.\r\n\r\nBut the destruction of Moscow had no effect upon the great principle that\r\nwas now in course of development all over the empire. The grand princedom\r\nwas still the centre of all the Russian operations: the grand prince was\r\nstill the acknowledged authority to which all the subordinate rulers\r\ndeferred. While this paramount virtue of cohesion remained unimpaired,\r\nthe incursions of the Tatars, however calamitous in their passing\r\nvisitations, had no other influence upon the ultimate destiny of the\r\ncountry than that of stimulating the latent patriotism of the population,\r\nand of convincing the petty princes, if indeed any further evidence were\r\nwanted, of the disastrous impolicy of wasting their resources in private\r\nfeuds.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE DEATH OF DMITRI DONSKOI; HIS PLACE IN HISTORY\r\n\r\nThe example of Dmitri Donskoi had clearly pointed out the course which\r\nit was the policy of the grand prince to follow; but, in order to place\r\nhis own views beyond the reach of speculation, and to enforce them\r\nin as solemn a manner as he could upon his successors, that prince\r\nplaced a last injunction upon his son, which he also addressed in his\r\nwill to all future grand princes, to persevere in the lofty object of\r\nregeneration by maintaining and strengthening the domestic alliances of\r\nthe sovereignty, and resisting the Tatars until they should be finally\r\ndriven out of Russia. His reign of twenty-seven years, crowned with\r\neventful circumstances, and subjected to many fluctuations, established\r\ntwo objects which were of the highest consequence to the ultimate\r\ncompletion of the great design. Amidst all the impediments that lay in\r\nhis way, or that sprang up as he advanced, Dmitri continued his efforts\r\nto create an order of nobility--the boyars, who, scattered through\r\nevery part of the empire, and surrounding his court on all occasions of\r\npolitical importance, held the keys of communication and control in their\r\nhands, by which the means of concentration were at all times facilitated.\r\nThat was one object, involving in its fulfilment the gradual reduction of\r\nthe power of the petty princes, and contributing mainly to the security\r\nof the second object, which was the chief agent of his designs against\r\nthe Tatars. In proportion as he won over the boyars to his side, and\r\ngave them an interest in his prosperity, he increased the power of the\r\ngrand princedom. These were the elements of his plan: the progressive\r\nconcentration of the empire, and the elevation of the grand princedom\r\nto the supreme authority. The checks that he met in the prosecution of\r\nthese purposes, of which the descent of the Tatar army upon Moscow was\r\nthe principal, slightly retarded, but never obscured, his progress.\r\nThe advances that he had made were evident. It did not require the\r\nattestation of his dying instructions to explain the aim of his life:\r\nit was visibly exemplified in the institutions he bequeathed to his\r\ncountry; in the altered state of society; and in the general submission\r\nof the appanages to a throne which, at the period of his accession, was\r\nshaken to its centre by rebellion.[d]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [1389 A.D.]]\r\n\r\nIn 1389 Dmitri died at the early age of thirty-nine. His grandfather,\r\nhis uncle, and his father had quietly prepared ample means for an\r\nopen decisive struggle. Dmitri’s merit consisted in the fact that he\r\nunderstood how to take advantage of these means, understood how to\r\ndevelop the forces at his disposal and to impart to them the proper\r\ndirection at the proper time. We do not intend to weigh the merits\r\nof Dmitri in comparison with those of his predecessors; we will only\r\nremark that the application of forces is usually more evident and\r\nmore resounding than their preparation, and that the reign of Dmitri,\r\ncrowded as it was from beginning to end with the events of a persistent\r\nand momentous struggle, easily eclipsed the reigns of his predecessors\r\nwith their sparse incidents. Events like the battle of Kulikovo make\r\na powerful impression upon the imagination of contemporaries and\r\nendure long in the remembrance of their descendants. It is therefore\r\nnot surprising that the victor of Mamai should have been given beside\r\nAlexander Nevski so conspicuous a place amongst the princes of the new\r\nnortheastern Russia. The best proof of the great importance attributed\r\nto Dmitri’s deeds by contemporaries is to be found in the existence of a\r\nseparate narrative of the exploits of this prince, a separate embellished\r\nbiography. Dmitri’s appearance is thus described: “He was strong and\r\nvaliant, and great and broad in body, broad shouldered and very heavy,\r\nhis beard and hair were black, and very wonderful was his gaze.” In his\r\nbiography the severity of his life is extolled, his aversion to pleasure,\r\nhis piety, gentleness, his chastity both before and after marriage; among\r\nother things it is said: “Although he was not learned in books, yet he\r\nhad spiritual books in his heart.” The end of Dmitri is thus described:\r\n“He fell ill and was in great pain, then it abated, but he again fell\r\ninto a great sickness and his groaning came to his heart, for it touched\r\nhis inner parts and his soul already drew near to death.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LIVE-FISH MERCHANT]\r\n\r\nThe important consequences of Dmitri’s activity are manifested in\r\nhis will and testament, in which we meet with hitherto unheard-of\r\ndispositions. The Moscow prince blesses his eldest son Vasili and\r\nendows him with the grand principality of Vladimir, which he calls his\r\npaternal inheritance. Donskoi no longer fears any rivals to his son,\r\neither from Tver or Suzdal. Besides Vasili, Dmitri had five sons: Iuri,\r\nAndrew, Peter, John, and Constantine; but the two latter were under\r\nage, Constantine having been born only four days before his father’s\r\ndeath, and the grand prince confides his paternal domain of Moscow to\r\nhis four elder sons. In this domain, that is in the town of Moscow and\r\nthe districts appertaining to it, Donskoi had ruled over two parts or\r\nshares, the share of his father Ivan and of his uncle Simeon, while the\r\nthird share was under the rule of Vladimir Andreevitch, to whom it now\r\nremained. Of his two shares the grand prince left one half to his eldest\r\nson Vasili; the other half was divided in three parts among the remaining\r\nsons, and the other towns of the principality of Moscow were divided\r\namong the four sons; Kolomna went to Vasili, the eldest, Zvenigorod to\r\nIuri, Mozhaisk to Andrew, Dmitrov to Peter.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE REIGN OF VASILI-DMITRIEVITCH (1389-1425 A.D.)\r\n\r\nFrom the very commencement of his reign the young son of Donskoi\r\nshowed that he would remain true to the traditions of his father and\r\ngrandfather. A year after the khan’s ambassador had placed him on the\r\ngrand prince’s throne at Vladimir, Vasili set out for the horde and there\r\npurchased a _iarlik_ (letter-patent of the khans) for the principality\r\nof Nijni-Novgorod, which not long before, after many entreaties had been\r\nobtained from the horde by Boris Constantinovitch. When the letter heard\r\nof Vasili’s designs, Boris called together his boyars and said to them\r\nwith tears in his eyes: “My lords and brothers, my boyars and friends!\r\nremember your oath on the cross, remember what you swore to me!” The\r\nsenior among his boyars was Vasili Rumianietz, who replied to the prince:\r\n“Do not grieve, my lord prince! we are all faithful to thee and ready to\r\nlay down our heads and to shed our blood for thee.” Thus he spoke to his\r\nprince, but meanwhile he sent to Vasili Dmitrievitch, promising to give\r\nup Boris Constantinovitch to him. On his way back from the horde, when\r\nhe had reached Kolomna, Vasili sent from there to Nijni the ambassador\r\nof Toktamish and his own boyars. At first Boris would not let them\r\nenter the town, but Rumianietz said to him: “My lord prince, the khan’s\r\nambassador and the Muscovite boyars come here in order to confirm peace\r\nand establish everlasting love, but thou wishest to raise dissensions\r\nand war; let them come into the town; what can they do to thee? we are\r\nall with thee.” But as soon as the ambassador and boyars had entered\r\nthe town, they ordered the bells to be rung, assembled the people, and\r\nannounced to them that Nijni already belonged to the prince of Moscow.\r\nWhen Boris heard this he sent for his boyars and said to them: “My lords\r\nand brothers, my beloved drujina! remember your oath on the cross, do\r\nnot give me up to my enemies.” But this same Rumianietz replied: “Lord\r\nprince! do not hope in us, we are no longer thine, we are not with thee,\r\nbut against thee!” Boris was seized, and when somewhat later Vasili\r\nDmitrievitch came to Nijni, he placed there his lieutenants; and Prince\r\nBoris, with his wife, children, and partisans, he ordered to be carried\r\naway in chains to various towns and kept in strict imprisonment.[e]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [1395-1412 A.D.]]\r\n\r\nThe princes of Suzdal, Boris’ nephews, were banished, and Vasili also\r\nacquired Suzdal. Later on the princes of Suzdal made peace with the\r\ngrand prince and received back from him their patrimonial estates,\r\nbut from generation to generation they remained dependants of Moscow\r\nand not independent rulers. In 1395 took place an event which raised\r\nthe moral importance of Moscow: on account of an expected invasion of\r\nTimur (Tamerlane), which, however, never took place, Vasili Dmitrievitch\r\nordered to be transported from Vladimir to Moscow that famous ikon which\r\nAndrew had formerly taken from Kiev to his beloved town of Vladimir; this\r\nikon now served to consecrate the pre-eminence of Moscow over all other\r\nRussian towns.\r\n\r\nFollowing in the steps of his predecessors, Vasili Dmitrievitch oppressed\r\nNovgorod, but did not however entirely attain to the goal of his designs.\r\nTwice he endeavoured to wrest her Dvinsk colonies from her, taking\r\nadvantage of the fact that in the Dvinsk territories a party had been\r\nformed which preferred the rule of the Moscow grand prince to that of\r\nGrand Novgorod. The people of Novgorod were fortunate in defending their\r\ncolonies, but they paid dearly for it: the grand prince laid waste the\r\nterritory of Novgorod, and ordered some of the inhabitants who had\r\nkilled a partisan of his at Torzhok to be strangled; but worse than all,\r\nNovgorod itself could not get on without the grand prince and was obliged\r\nto turn to him for help when another grand prince, namely the Lithuanian,\r\nattempted its conquest.\r\n\r\nAt that period the horde was so torn up with inward dissensions that\r\nVasili had not for some years paid tribute to the khan and regarded\r\nhimself as independent; but in 1408 an unexpected attack was made\r\non Moscow by the Tatar prince Edigei, who like Mamai, without being\r\nkhan himself, made those who bore the name of khan obey him. Vasili\r\nDmitrievitch being off his guard and thinking that the horde had become\r\nweakened, did not take early measures against his wily adversary, who\r\ndeceived him by his hypocrisy and pretended good-will. Like his father\r\nhe escaped to Kostroma, but provided better than his father for the\r\ndefence of Moscow by confiding it to his brave uncle, Prince Vladimir\r\nAndreevitch. The inhabitants themselves burned their faubourg, and\r\nEdigei could not take the Kremlin, but the horde laid waste many Russian\r\ntowns and villages. Moscow now learned that although the horde had no\r\nlonger the power to hold Russia in servitude, yet it might still make\r\nitself terrible by its sudden incursions, devastations, and capture of\r\nthe inhabitants. Shortly thereafter, in 1412, Vasili went to the horde\r\nto do homage to the new khan Djelalledin, brought him tribute, and made\r\npresents to the Tatar grandees, so that the khan confirmed the grand\r\nprincipality to the prince of Moscow, although he had previously intended\r\nto bestow it upon the exiled prince of Nijni-Novgorod. The power of the\r\nkhans over Russia was now only held by a thread; but for some time yet\r\nthe Moscow princes could take advantage of it in order to strengthen\r\ntheir own authority over Russia and to shelter their inclinations under\r\nthe shadow of its ancient might. Meanwhile they took measures of defence\r\nagainst the Tatar invasions, which might be all the more annoying because\r\nthey were directed from various sides and from various fragments of the\r\ncrumbling horde. In the west the Lithuanian power, which had sprung up\r\nunder Gedimin, and grown great under Olgerd, had attained to its utmost\r\nlimits under Vitovt.\r\n\r\nStrictly speaking, the supreme authority over Lithuania and the part\r\nof Russia in subjection to it belonged to Iagello, king of Poland; but\r\nLithuania was governed independently in the quality of viceroy by his\r\ncousin Vitovt, the son of that Keistut who had been strangled by Iagello.\r\nVitovt, following the example of his predecessors, aimed at extending the\r\nfrontiers of Lithuania at the expense of the Russian territories, and\r\ngradually subjugated one after another of them. Vasili Dmitrievitch was\r\nmarried to the daughter of Vitovt, Sophia; throughout his reign, he had\r\nto keep up friendly relations with his kinsman, and yet be on his guard\r\nagainst the ambitious designs of his father-in-law. The Muscovite prince\r\nacted with great caution and prudence, giving way to his father-in-law\r\nas far as possible, but safeguarded himself and Russia from him. He did\r\nnot hinder Vitovt from taking Smolensk, chiefly because the last prince\r\nof Smolensk, Iuri, was a villain in the full sense of the word, and the\r\ninhabitants themselves preferred to submit to Vitovt, rather than to\r\ntheir own prince. When however Vitovt showed too plainly his intentions\r\nof capturing Pskov and Novgorod, the grand prince of Moscow openly took\r\nup arms against his father-in-law and a war seemed imminent; but in\r\n1407 the matter was settled between them, and a peace was concluded by\r\nwhich the river Ougra was made a boundary between the Muscovite and the\r\nLithuanian possessions.\r\n\r\n\r\nVASILI VASILIEVITCH (AFTERWARDS CALLED “THE BLIND” OR “THE DARK”)\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [1425-1435 A.D.]]\r\n\r\nVasili Dmitrievitch died in 1425. His successor, Vasili Vasilievitch,\r\nwas a man of limited gifts and of weak mind and will, but capable of\r\nevery villainy and treachery. The members of the princely house had been\r\nheld in utter subjection under Vasili Dmitrievitch, but at his death\r\nthey raised their heads, and Iuri, the uncle of Vasili Vasilievitch,\r\nendeavoured to obtain the grand principality from the horde. But the\r\nartful and wily boyar, Ivan Dmitrievitch Vsevolozhsky, succeeded in 1432\r\nin setting aside Iuri and assuring the grand principality to Vasili\r\nVasilievitch. When Iuri pleaded his right of seniority as uncle, and in\r\nsupport of his claim cited precedents by which uncles had been preferred,\r\nas seniors in years and birth, to their nephews, Vsevolozhsky represented\r\nto the khan that Vasili had already received the principality by will of\r\nthe khan and that this will should be held above all laws and customs.\r\nThis appeal to the absolute will of the khan pleased the latter and\r\nVasili Vasilievitch remained grand prince. Some years later this same\r\nboyar, angered at Vasili because the latter had first promised to marry\r\nhis daughter and then married Marie Iaroslavna, the granddaughter of\r\nVladimir Andreevitch Serpukhovski, himself incited Iuri to wrest the\r\nprincipality from his nephew. Thus Russia again became the prey of civil\r\nwars, which were signalised by hideous crimes. Iuri, who had taken\r\npossession of Moscow, was again expelled and soon after died. The son\r\nof Iuri, Vasili Kossoi (the Squinting) concluded peace with Vasili, and\r\nthen, having treacherously violated the treaty, attacked Vasili, but\r\nhe was vanquished, captured, and blinded (1435). After a few years the\r\nfollowing events took place at the Golden Horde: the khan Ulu Makhmet was\r\ndeprived of his throne and sought the aid of the grand prince of Moscow.\r\nThe grand prince not only refused him his aid, but also drove him out of\r\nthe boundaries of the territory of Moscow. Ulu Makhmet and his partisans\r\nthen established themselves on the banks of the Volga at Kazan, and\r\nthere laid the foundations of a Tatar empire that during a whole century\r\nbrought desolation on Russia. Ulu Makhmet, as ruler of Kazan, avenged\r\nhimself on the Muscovite prince for the past, was victorious over him in\r\nbattle, and took him prisoner. Vasili Vasilievitch only recovered his\r\nliberty by paying an enormous ransom. When he returned to his native\r\nland, he was against his will obliged to lay upon the people heavy taxes\r\nand to receive Tatars into his principality and give them estates. All\r\nthis awakened dissatisfaction against him, of which the Galician prince\r\nDmitri Shemiaka, the brother of Kossoi, hastened to take advantage,\r\nand joining himself to the princes of Tver and Mozhaisk, in 1446 he\r\nordered Vasili to be treacherously seized at the monastery of Troitsa and\r\nblinded. Shemiaka took possession of the grand principality and kept the\r\nblind Vasili in confinement, but observing an agitation among the people,\r\nhe yielded to the request of Jonas, bishop of Riazan, and gave Vasili\r\nhis liberty, at the same time making him swear that he would not seek to\r\nregain the grand principality. Vasili did not keep his oath, and in 1447\r\nthe partisans of the blind prince again raised him to the throne.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [1447-1448 A.D.]]\r\n\r\nIt is remarkable that from this period the reign of Vasili Vasilievitch\r\nentirely changed in character. While he had his eyesight, Vasili was a\r\nmost insignificant sovereign, but from the time that he lost his eyes,\r\nhis reign becomes distinguished for its firmness, intelligence, and\r\ndecision. It is evident that clever and active men must have ruled in the\r\nname of the blind prince. Such were the boyars: the princes Patrikeev,\r\nRiapolovski, Koshkin, Plesktcheev, Morozov, and the famous voyevods,\r\nStriga-Obolenski and Theodore Bassenok, but above all the metropolitan\r\nJonas.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Jonas Becomes Metropolitan_\r\n\r\n[Illustration: RUSSIAN WOMAN]\r\n\r\nJonas was a native of Kostroma. When he was made bishop of Riazan he did\r\nnot in any wise become a partisan of the local views, his sympathies\r\ninclined to Moscow because, in conformity with the conditions of that\r\nepoch, Jonas saw in Moscow alone the centre of Russian unification.\r\nIn 1431, at the death of the metropolitan Photius, Jonas was elected\r\nmetropolitan, but the patriarch of Constantinople had already named\r\nthe Greek Isidore to that office. This Isidore had participated in the\r\ncapacity of Russian metropolitan, in the Florentine council which had\r\nproclaimed the union of the Greek church with the Roman, the pope of\r\nRome to be the head of the Universal church. Isidore, together with the\r\npatriarch of Constantinople and the Byzantine emperor had submitted to\r\nthe pope; for Isidore was at heart a Greek: all his aims were directed\r\nto the salvation of his perishing country, and like many other Greeks\r\nhe hoped through the pope to arouse Europe against the Turks. It was\r\nthese hopes that had caused the Greeks of that time to sacrifice the\r\nindependence of their church. In the eyes of Isidore Russia too was\r\nto serve as an instrument for Greek patriotic designs; but the union\r\nwas rejected at Moscow, Isidore was driven out, and for some years the\r\noffice of metropolitan of Moscow remained unoccupied. Kiev had its own\r\nmetropolitans since the days of Vitovt, but Moscow did not wish to have\r\nanything to do with them. The bishop of Riazan, Jonas, having been\r\nalready named metropolitan by the Russian clergy, enjoyed at Moscow\r\na pre-eminent importance and influence, and finally, in 1448, this\r\narchbishop was raised to the rank of metropolitan by an assembly of the\r\nRussian bishops, without regard to the patriarch. This event was a\r\ndecisive breach with the past, and from that time the eastern-Russian\r\nchurch ceased to depend upon the patriarch of Constantinople and acquired\r\nfull independence. The centre of her supreme power was Moscow, and this\r\ncircumstance definitively established that moral importance of Moscow,\r\nwhich had been aimed for by the metropolitan Peter, which had been held\r\nup by Alexis, and which had received greater brilliancy from the transfer\r\nof the ikon of the Blessed Virgin from Vladimir. From that time the\r\nRussian territories not yet subject to Moscow and aiming to preserve\r\ntheir independence from her--Tver, Riazan, Novgorod--were bound to her\r\nmore closely by spiritual bonds.\r\n\r\nWhen he had for the third time ascended the throne of Moscow, the grand\r\nprince designated as co-regent with himself his eldest son Ivan, who\r\nwas thenceforth called grand prince like his father, as is shown by\r\nthe treaties of that period. It was from that time that the political\r\nactivity of Ivan commenced and gradually widened; and there is no\r\ndoubt that when he attained his majority it was he, and not his blind\r\nfather that directed the accomplishment of the events which led to the\r\nstrengthening of Moscow. Prince Dmitri Shemiaka, who had been obliged to\r\npromise on his oath to desist from any further attempts upon the grand\r\nprincipality, did not cease to show his enmity against Vasili the Dark.\r\nThe clergy wrote to Shemiaka a letter of admonishment, but he would\r\nnot listen to their remonstrances, and the armies of Moscow marched\r\nwith the blessing of Jonas and accompanied by the young prince, against\r\nShemiaka in Galicia. Shemiaka was defeated and fled to Novgorod, where\r\nthe inhabitants gave him a refuge, and Galicia with its dependencies\r\nwas again joined to Moscow. Shemiaka continued to plot against Vasili,\r\ntook Ustiug, and established himself there; but the young prince Ivan\r\nVasilievitch drove him out, and Shemiaka again fled to Novgorod. The\r\nmetropolitan Jonas issued an edict declaring Shemiaka excommunicated from\r\nthe church, forbidding orthodox persons to eat and drink with him, and\r\nreproaching the people of Novgorod for having received him. It was then\r\ndecided at Moscow to put an end to Shemiaka by secretly murdering him;\r\nthe secretary Borodati, through Shemiaka’s boyar Ivan Kotov, induced\r\nShemiaka’s cook to prepare and serve to him a poisoned fowl (1453).\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [1462 A.D.]]\r\n\r\nVasili the Dark died on the 5th of March, 1462, from an unsuccessful\r\ntreatment of burns. He outlived his chief counsellor, the metropolitan\r\nJonas, by a year, the latter having died on the 31st of March, 1461.[h]\r\n\r\n\r\nA REVIEW OF THE INTERNAL DEVELOPMENT DURING THE TATAR PERIOD\r\n\r\nThe beginning of the fourteenth century was the commencement of a new\r\nepoch in the life of Russia; in its two halves two empires began to\r\ncrystallize: that of Moscow in the east and that of Lithuania in the\r\nwest, and the scattered elements began to gather around the new centres.\r\nSuch a centre for eastern Russia was Moscow, until then an insignificant\r\ntown, rarely mentioned in the chronicles, being the share of the younger\r\nand therefore less powerful princes. Under Daniel Aleksandrovitch[22]\r\nthe town of Moscow constituted the whole principality. With the\r\nacquisition of Pereiaslavl (1302), Mozhaisk (1303), and Kolomna (1308)\r\nthis region became somewhat more extended, but when it fell to the\r\nshare of Ivan Danilovitch after the death of his brother Iuri, it was\r\nstill very insignificant; and yet through its resources the princes\r\nof Moscow managed to become the first in eastern Russia and little by\r\nlittle to gather round them the whole of eastern Russia. The rise of\r\nthe principality of Moscow is one of the most remarkable phenomena in\r\nthe history of Russia. It is therefore not surprising that particular\r\nattention should have been directed towards it by historians, and by the\r\nlight of their united investigations the phenomenon becomes sufficiently\r\nclear.\r\n\r\nIn the thirteenth century, under the domination of the Tatars in eastern\r\nRussia, there was a continual struggle amongst the princes for the title\r\nof grand prince, to which they also strove to unite the possession of\r\nVladimir. We also observe another distinctive feature of the time,\r\nwhich was that the princes did not remain to live in Vladimir, but only\r\nstrove to unite it to their own possessions, and thus augment them, and,\r\nif possible, secure them for their families. The struggle was for the\r\npreponderance of one family over another through the extension of its\r\nterritorial possessions. In the Kievan period, whoever became prince of\r\nKiev, removed to Kiev, and named someone of his own family as ruler in\r\nhis own principality, so that if Kiev were lost and it should pass into\r\nanother family, he would not lose his own patrimony.\r\n\r\nDuring the Tatar period we note a new phenomenon: the princes did not\r\nmerely separate themselves from their patrimonial lands, but even from\r\ntheir capitals; for instance: Iaroslav lived in Tver, Basil in Kostroma,\r\nAndrew in Gorodeza, Dmitri in Pereiaslavl, and so on. The power of a\r\ngrand prince at that time was only a hegemony, a preponderance over\r\nother princes; as a testimony of their independence the other princes,\r\nthe elders of their families (such as Riazan, Tver, etc.) began also\r\nto call themselves grand princes, and the preponderance of the grand\r\nprince of Vladimir little by little lost its significance. To all this\r\nthere must yet be added another special circumstance, that in order for\r\nanyone to unite Vladimir and its territory to his possessions and thus\r\nobtain the predominance, a _iarlik_ or letter of the khan was required;\r\nno rights were necessary and a wide field was open for every guest. Thus\r\nthere appeared a new basis for the right of succession: the favour of\r\nthe khan. To obtain this favour was the aim of all the princes, to keep\r\nit--a peculiar art. Whoever possessed this art would be the head over all\r\neastern Russia, and whoever could maintain this position was bound to\r\nsubordinate all the rest to himself. In consequence of this, the first\r\ncondition for success at that time was a dexterous tactfulness, and\r\nwhoever possessed this quality must come out victor. This dexterousness\r\nwas a peculiar distinction of the Muscovite princes, and in it lay the\r\nchief cause of their success. They had neither power nor higher rights,\r\nand all their hopes were founded on their own skill and the favour of\r\nthe khan. They had no riches, and their patrimonial lands, poor and\r\nsecluded, away from the great rivers which were then the chief means of\r\ncommunication, did not yield them large means.\r\n\r\nBut to ensure success with the khan, his wife, and the princes of the\r\nhorde, money was necessary; so they became saving and scraping, and\r\nall their capacities were directed to the acquisition of gain. Their\r\nqualities were neither brilliant nor attractive, but in their position\r\nit was only by these sober qualities that anything could be obtained.\r\nAlexander Iaroslavitch (Nevski) pointed out to his successors that their\r\npolicy should be to give way when necessary and to wait when uncertain.\r\nHe who followed this counsel was successful; whosoever hurried, like\r\nAlexander Mikhailovitch (of Tver), was a loser in the game.\r\n\r\nBut while taking advantage of every means of influence at the horde, the\r\nMuscovite princes did not lose sight of those means by which they could\r\nalso act within Russia itself. Ivan Danilovitch managed to induce the\r\nmetropolitan St. Peter to come to Moscow, and his successors continued\r\nto reside in that town. The alliance with the spiritual power, the only\r\npower that embraced the whole of Russia, was of extraordinary advantage\r\nto the Muscovite princes.\r\n\r\nThe metropolitan could exert his influence everywhere. Thus Theognost\r\nclosed the churches at Pskov when that city offered an asylum to\r\nAlexander Mikhailovitch, and St. Sergius did likewise at Nijni-Novgorod\r\nwhen it accepted a prince to whom Moscow was opposed. This alliance was\r\na most natural one: if the princes needed the authority of the church,\r\nthe clergy--at that time the representatives of the most advanced ideas\r\nconcerning the civil order--sought to realise that order of which it\r\nstood in need even for its purely economic interests. There is not the\r\nslightest doubt that one of the chief causes of the devotion of the\r\nclergy to the views and policies of the Muscovite princes, lay in its\r\nconviction that it was bound to derive material advantages from the\r\nconcentration of all power in the hands of one prince. In fact, while\r\nthe system of appanages prevailed, it was, on the one hand, extremely\r\ndifficult for the clergy to enjoy its possessions and privileges in\r\nsecurity, because the maintenance of this security depended not on\r\none, but on many; while on the other hand, the princes of appanages\r\ninfringed on clerical privileges more frequently than the grand prince.\r\nThe dispersion of the monastic estates over several principalities still\r\nfurther contributed to the desire of the clergy for the abolition of\r\nthe appanage system, which increased the difficulties of managing those\r\nestates. Especially in the case of war among the princes of appanages,\r\nthe clergy of one appanage might easily be deprived of its possessions in\r\nanother appanage, because at such a time all means of injuring the enemy\r\nwere considered permissible.\r\n\r\nIn the increase of power of the Muscovite princes a leading part also\r\nbelongs to the Moscow boyars, whose activity was principally displayed\r\nduring the youth or minority of the grand princes.[23]\r\n\r\nSuch were the principal causes of the strength of the Moscow princes;\r\nto them should be added (according to the historians N. V. Stankevitch\r\nand S. M. Soloviov) the central position of the principality of Moscow,\r\nboth in the sense that Moscow is near the sources of the chief rivers,\r\nand that an attack from without must first fall on the surrounding\r\nprincipalities. But these causes are evidently secondary and would have\r\nno significance without the others: Moscow is not so far from the other\r\nprincipalities that these advantages would belong to her alone. It was\r\nmuch more important that a wise policy, by preserving Moscow from the\r\nattacks of the Tatars, attracted thither an increased population and thus\r\nenriched the principality. A final important cause was the weakening\r\nof the Tatar horde and its dismemberment at the end of this period, of\r\nwhich the princes of Moscow did not fail to take advantage for their own\r\nends.[b]\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE INFLUENCE OF TATAR DOMINATION\r\n\r\nKaramsin, in relating the history of the invasion of Russia by the\r\nMongols, makes some reflections on the consequences of the domination\r\nof these barbarians for the Russian people. In spite of his devotion to\r\nautocratic power, he cannot prevent himself from keenly regretting the\r\nliberty which this power had superseded.\r\n\r\n“There was a time,” he says, “when Russia, shaped and elevated by the\r\nunity of the sovereign power, yielded neither in force nor civilisation\r\nto the foremost of the European powers founded by the peoples of Germany\r\non the ruins of the Western Empire. Having the same character, the same\r\nlaws, the same usages, the same political institutions, which were\r\ncommunicated to Russia by the Varangian or Norman princes, she took her\r\nplace in the new political system of Europe with some real claims to a\r\ngreat importance, and with the remarkable advantage of being under the\r\ninfluence of Greece, the only one of all the powers which had not been\r\noverthrown by the barbarians. This happy time for Russia, is that of\r\nIaroslav the Great. Strengthened by both Christianity and public order,\r\nshe possessed a religious teaching, schools, laws, an important trade,\r\na numerous army, a fleet, unity of power, and civil liberty. What was\r\nEurope at the beginning of the eleventh century? The theatre of feudal\r\ntyranny, of the weakness of sovereigns, of audacity amongst the barons,\r\nof slavery in the peoples, of superstition and of ignorance. The genius\r\nof Alfred and Charlemagne shone through the darkness, but soon faded\r\naway; their memory only has survived, their beneficent institutions,\r\ntheir generous intentions, disappeared with them.\r\n\r\n“The shadow of barbarism, by veiling the horizon of Russia, hid Europe\r\nfrom its sight at the very time at which enlightenment was beginning to\r\nspread there; when the people began to shake off slavery, and the towns\r\nto contract alliances for their mutual guarantee against oppression; when\r\nthe invention of the compass extended navigation and commerce; the time\r\nwhich saw the foundation of universities, in which fine manners began\r\nto soften, etc. During this period Russia, oppressed and torn asunder\r\nby the Mongols, was collecting all her forces merely that she might not\r\nperish. There was then no question of civilisation for the Russians. The\r\nrigours of the climate did not permit the Mongols to establish themselves\r\nin Russia as they had done in China and India. The khans wished to reign\r\nover Russia only from afar. But the envoys of the horde, representing\r\nthe person of the khan, did what they chose in Russia; the traders,\r\neven the Mongol vagabonds, treated Russians as vile slaves. What was\r\nthe natural consequence? Moral degradation. Forgetting national pride\r\nRussians learnt base cunning--the ruses and bravado of the weak. They\r\ndeceived the Tatars, and one another they deceived still more. While\r\nransoming themselves at the price of gold from the oppressions of the\r\nbarbarians, they became more greedy, and less sensitive to insults and\r\nto shame, exposed as they were to the violence of foreign tyrants. From\r\nthe time of Vasili Iaroslavitch down to that of Ivan Kalita (that most\r\nunhappy period!) Russia resembled a black forest rather than a state;\r\nmight appeared to be right; he who could pillage, pillaged, foreigners\r\nand natives alike; there was no safety, either on the roads or at home;\r\nrobbery destroyed property everywhere. And when this terrible anarchy\r\nbegan to disappear, when the stupor and the terror had ceased, and law,\r\nwhich is the soul of society, could at least be re-established, it was\r\nthen necessary to have recourse to a severity unknown to the ancient\r\nRussians. Light pecuniary fines had formerly sufficed for the repression\r\nof theft, but already in the fourteenth century, thieves were hanged. The\r\nRussian of Iaroslav’s day knew no other blows than those he might receive\r\nin a private quarrel; under the yoke of the Mongols corporal punishment\r\nwas introduced. It may be that the present character of the nation\r\nstill offers traces which were impressed upon it by the barbarity of\r\nthe conqueror. It must be remarked also that, together with other noble\r\nqualities, valour and military courage grew visibly weaker. Formerly the\r\nprinces had struck with the sword; during this period they redressed\r\ntheir grievances by means only of baseness and complaints brought before\r\nthe khans. If, after two centuries of such slavery, Russians have not\r\nlost all moral sense, all love for virtue, and all patriotism, let us\r\nthank the influence of religion; it is religion which has maintained them\r\nin the position of men and citizens, which has not allowed hearts to grow\r\nhard, and conscience to be silenced. Humiliated as Russians they again\r\nraised themselves under the name of Christians, and they loved their\r\ncountry as being a country of true believers.\r\n\r\n“The internal constitution of the state was changed; everything which\r\nwas free, everything which was founded on ancient rights, civil or\r\npolitical, became extinct. After having humbly cringed to the horde,\r\nthe princes returned to their homes as terrible masters, for they were\r\ncommanding in the name of a supreme suzerain. That which could not be\r\ndone either in the days of Iaroslav the Great or in those of Andrew and\r\nof Vsevolod III, was accomplished noiselessly and without difficulty in\r\nthe time of the Mongols. At Vladimir and everywhere else, except Novgorod\r\nand Pskov, there was no longer heard the sound of the vetché bell, that\r\nmanifestation of popular sovereignty; a manifestation which was often\r\ntumultuous, but dear to the descendants of Slavo-Russians. This right of\r\nthe ancient towns was no longer known to the new towns, like Moscow and\r\nTver, which became important during the Mongol dominion. Once only do the\r\nchronicles make mention of the vetché of Moscow and they speak of it as\r\nan extraordinary event--when the capital, threatened by the enemy, and\r\nabandoned by the sovereign, found itself thrown on its own resources.\r\nThe towns had lost the right of electing their chiefs, who, by their\r\nimportance and the splendour of their elective dignity, had given umbrage\r\nnot only to the princely dignitaries but to the princes themselves.”[f]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Wallace’s View_\r\n\r\nThe Tatar domination did not by any means Tatarise the country. The\r\nTatars never settled in Russia proper, and never amalgamated with the\r\npeople. So long as they retained their semi-pagan, semi-Buddhistic\r\nreligion, a certain number of their notables became Christians and were\r\nabsorbed by the Russian noblesse; but as soon as the horde adopted Islam,\r\nthis movement was arrested. There was no blending of the two races\r\nsuch as has taken place--and is still taking place--between the Russian\r\npeasantry and the Finnish tribes of the north. The Russians remained\r\nChristians, and the Tatars remained Mahommedans; and this difference of\r\nreligion raised an impassable barrier between the two nationalities.\r\n\r\nIt must, however, be admitted that the Tatar domination, though it\r\nhad little influence on the life and habits of the people, had a very\r\ndeep and lasting influence on the political development of the nation.\r\nAt the time of the conquest Russia was composed of a large number of\r\nindependent principalities, all governed by the descendants of Rurik.\r\nAs these principalities were not geographical or ethnographical units,\r\nbut mere artificial, arbitrarily defined districts, which were regularly\r\nsubdivided or combined according to the hereditary rights of the princes,\r\nit is highly probable that they would in any case have been sooner or\r\nlater united under one sceptre; but it is quite certain that the policy\r\nof the khans helped to accelerate this unification and to create the\r\nautocratic power which has since been wielded by the czars.[c]\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES\r\n\r\n[10] [This is, of course, meant only in a limited sense. The migration\r\nof peoples still continues with unabated force, but its centre has moved\r\nfrom Asia to Europe. Thence it moves in a two-fold direction: on the one\r\nhand, from western Europe to America and Australia; and on the other\r\nhand, from eastern Europe to the remotest confines of Asia.]\r\n\r\n[11] [A modern army inevitably loses in numbers and its difficulties\r\nincrease as it advances from its base of operations into the enemy’s\r\ncountry. The very reverse was the situation of the Tatars. They needed\r\nno base of operations, for they took along with them their flocks, their\r\ntents, and all their belongings, and while their flocks fed upon the\r\ngrassy steppes, they in turn fed upon their flocks. And the nomadic and\r\npredatory tribes whom they encountered on their march led the same kind\r\nof life as themselves, and were easily induced to join in the certain\r\nexpectation of plunder. Thus the tide kept on ever increasing and gaining\r\nin force. In fact, the Tatars can hardly be styled an army, but a people\r\nin motion.[k][a]]\r\n\r\n[12] [At first the Russians had only very vague notions as to who this\r\nterrible enemy was. The old chronicler remarks briefly: “For our sins\r\nunknown people have appeared. No one knows who they are or whence they\r\nhave come, or to what race and faith they belong. They are commonly\r\ncalled Tatars, but some call them Tauermen, and others Petchenegs. Who\r\nthey really are is known only to God, and perhaps to wise men deeply read\r\nin books.” Some of these “wise men deeply read in books” supposed them to\r\nbe the idolatrous Moabites who had in Old Testament times harassed God’s\r\nchosen people; whilst others thought that they must be the descendants\r\nof the men whom Gideon had driven out, of whom a reverent saint had\r\nprophesied that they would come in the latter days and conquer the whole\r\nearth, from the East even unto the Euphrates, and from the Tigris even\r\nunto the Black Sea.[c]]\r\n\r\n[13] Or the Purse.\r\n\r\n[14] In the governments of Novgorod, Vladimir, Kostroma, and Rostov, and\r\nthe cities of Duglitch, Bielozersk, and Galitch.--[See Karamsin, and an\r\nact of Dmitri Donskoi.]\r\n\r\n[15] From 1333 to 1339 the princes who held appanages espoused the\r\ncause of the prince of Tver against the grand prince of Moscow, whom\r\nthey called a tyrant. In 1339 the grand prince of Moscow returned to\r\nthe horde, and so terrified Usbek Khan by his denunciations against the\r\nprince of Tver and other princes, that the khan immediately summoned them\r\nto the horde, in order to restrain, or get rid of them.--[See Karamsin.]\r\n\r\n[16] See Kamenevitch (translated by Karamsin), describing the great mart\r\nof Mologa, where the commerce of Asia and of Europe met in the seventy\r\ninns of its Slavonian suburb; and where seven thousand two hundred\r\npounds’ weight of silver were collected for the treasury of the prince.\r\n\r\n[17] See the treaty of Dmitri Donskoi with Vladimir his uncle, who\r\npromised to pay to him the tribute of his appanage, which bore the name\r\nof the khan’s tribute; and the second treaty with the same Vladimir, by\r\nwhich the latter prince engaged that his boyars should pay to Dmitri the\r\nsame tax which the grand prince might think proper to impose on his own\r\nboyars.\r\n\r\n[18] It was thus that, in France, in 1445, Charles VII took advantage of\r\nthe exactions of the English, and of the terror which they inspired, to\r\nrender perpetual the temporary taxes, and to keep up a permanent corps of\r\ntwenty-five thousand men.\r\n\r\n[19] Usbek, it is true, with macchiavellian policy, designated all the\r\nchildren of Ivan I as his successors; but, in 1340, he allowed Simeon,\r\nthe oldest and ablest of them, to make himself sole master of the throne.\r\nIanisbek Khan nominated Ivan II, the brother of Simeon, after his death\r\nand that of his children, to the exclusion of a prince of the branch\r\nof Tver or Nevski. A prince Dmitri, of the Nevski branch, who had been\r\nmade grand prince by a whim of Naurus Khan, was deposed in 1362 by Murat\r\nKhan, who chose Dmitri Donskoi, grandson of Ivan I, and son of Ivan II.\r\nTaktamuisch also gave the throne to Vasili II, the eldest son of Donskoi\r\n(1389). Lastly, Ulu-Mahomet nominated Vasili III, son of Vasili II, and\r\nfather of the great Ivan III, whom this long succession rendered so\r\npowerful that he completely crushed the horde.\r\n\r\n[20] From 1362 to 1380.\r\n\r\n[21] [150,000 in Soloviov and Rambaud.]\r\n\r\n[22] A son of Alexander Nevski.\r\n\r\n[23] “The origin of the Russian aristocracy,” says Turgeniev[f], quoting\r\nfrom Karamzin, “is lost in the most remote antiquity. The dignity of\r\nboyar is perhaps even more ancient than that of prince; it distinguished\r\nthe knights and the most notable citizens, who, in the Slav republics,\r\ncommanded the armies and administrated the country. This dignity appears\r\nnever to have been hereditary, but only personal. Although in the\r\ncourse of time it was sometimes conferred by the princes, each of the\r\nancient towns had nevertheless its own boyars, who filled the principal\r\nelective offices; even the boyars created by the princes enjoyed a\r\ncertain independence. Thus, in the treaties of the fourteenth and\r\nfifteenth centuries, we often see the contracting parties confirming\r\nto the boyars the right of quitting the service of one prince to enter\r\nthe service of another. Dissatisfied at Tchernigov, the boyar went with\r\nhis numerous following to Kiev, Galitch, or Vladimir, where he found\r\nnew fiefs and tokens of general respect. But when southern Russia had\r\nbecome transformed into Lithuania, when Moscow began to grow larger\r\nat the expense of the neighbouring principalities, when the number of\r\nprinces possessing appanages began to diminish, at the same time that\r\nthe sovereign’s power over the people was becoming more unlimited, then\r\nthe dignity of boyar also lost its ancient importance. Popular power\r\nwas favourable to that of the boyars, which acting through the prince\r\non the people, could also act through these latter on the prince. This\r\nsupport at last failed them. Nothing remained to the boyars but to obey\r\ntheir prince, or to become traitors or rebels; there was no golden mean\r\nto take, and in the face of the sovereign, no legal means of opposition\r\nexisted. In a word absolute power was developing itself.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV. FROM IVAN THE GREAT TO IVAN THE TERRIBLE\r\n\r\n    The great ruler who occupied the throne of Moscow at the end of\r\n    the fifteenth century, was richly endowed with understanding;\r\n    to his contemporaries he appeared more lucky than active,\r\n    but meanwhile it was his active mind that directed all the\r\n    complicated and tangled threads of the foreign and domestic\r\n    relations. If his contemporaries did not always do justice\r\n    to the great unificator of the land of Russia, neither is\r\n    posterity always just to him. We must allow that much had been\r\n    prepared by his predecessors, and this was also recognised\r\n    by contemporaries; but it is nevertheless impossible not to\r\n    acknowledge that Ivan towers far above his predecessors,\r\n    both by his solution of ancient problems--the unification of\r\n    Russia (which he had almost completed) and the throwing off\r\n    of the Tatar yoke--and the raising of new ones. The ability\r\n    to take advantage of circumstances places Ivan in the rank\r\n    of great men. If we do not recognise his greatness, then we\r\n    must apply the same judgment in part to Peter, who was largely\r\n    only the more determined successor of his brother, father, and\r\n    grandfather.--BESTUZHEV RIUMIN.[b]\r\n\r\n\r\nACCESSION OF IVAN (III) VASILIEVITCH\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [1462-1584 A.D.]]\r\n\r\nThe dynasty of the Muscovite princes, which commenced in the person\r\nof Ivan Kalita, and was preserved unbroken in the lineal descent,\r\nwas fortunately strengthened by the accident of the longevity of his\r\nsuccessors. The reigns of Ivan, of Simeon the Proud, of Dmitri Donskoi,\r\nof Vasili, and of Vasili the Blind, embraced a period of 130 years.\r\nDuring that time the people had become habituated to a right which saved\r\nthem from the contests of rival competitors. So many protracted reigns\r\nhad stamped the legitimate authority with an unquestioned ascendency, and\r\nwith this growth of time its powers inevitably increased. The manners of\r\nthe Russians were now formed under a rule in which the succession was\r\nfixed and immutable, and under which a progressive system of legislation\r\nwas gradually assuming a compact and tangible form. The chaos of\r\nantagonistic principles--of that misrule which is born of short-lived\r\ntheories, of constant interruption, and unsettled governments--was\r\nrapidly dissolving; the light of defined administration and regulated\r\npower was rising upon the empire; and the people, who were now beginning\r\nto understand the benefits of constituted rights, were ready to support\r\ntheir maintenance.\r\n\r\nUnder these auspicious circumstances, Ivan III, or, as he is called by\r\nsome historians, Ivan the Great, ascended the throne.\r\n\r\nIt was not to be expected that a liberal and enlightened government could\r\nat once spring from the materials which were accumulated in seasons of\r\nanarchy, relieved only by interstitial gleams of peace. The natural\r\nissue of a power purchased by enormous sacrifices, and reared up amidst\r\ndifficulties, was unmitigated despotism. The grand princedom was erected\r\nin storms. Its power was built up by constant accessions won at the point\r\nof the sword, or procured by profligate bribery. It was not the growth\r\nof steady improvement, of public opinion, of the voluntary acquiescence\r\nof the people. It began by direct oppression, absolute tyranny, and\r\nopen injustice. The acts of outrage which the grand princes committed\r\nin their efforts to sustain their authority were acts of necessity.\r\nThey were placed in a situation of peril that exposed them equally to\r\nbarbarian spoilers without, and insidious enemies within; and they were\r\ncompelled to vindicate their authority by the force of arms and the arts\r\nof perfidy. Their whole career was a fluctuating war against a series of\r\nresistances. They conciliated less than they subdued, and the unity which\r\nwas at last gained by perseverance in a mixed policy of violence and\r\nhypocrisy was more the bond of an interest in common, than the reasonable\r\nallegiance of a free people to a government of their own choice.\r\n\r\nThroughout the struggle for the concentration of the supreme control\r\nin one head the church, as will already have been perceived, bore a\r\nprominent part. The authority of the clergy had gone on gradually\r\nassuming a more stern and arbitrary aspect, even while the political\r\naffairs of the country were undergoing daily vicissitudes. The evils\r\nthat afflicted the state passed harmless over the church; and while\r\nthe one was subjected to disasters that checked its progress towards\r\nprosperity, the other was constantly enlarging its powers, profiting\r\nby the misfortunes that surrounded it, and gleaning its share of the\r\ngood fortune that occasionally improved the hopes of the people. In the\r\nearly periods when Russia was merely the victim of her own dissensions,\r\nthe church was freely admitted as a mediator, partly in virtue of her\r\noffice as the dispenser of charity and peace, and partly from the\r\nveneration in which religion and its ordinances were held. When the\r\nTatars invaded Russia, they perceived the mighty influence which the\r\npriests exercised over the passions of the people, and, fully persuaded\r\nof the wisdom of attaching to their cause an order of men who wielded so\r\nenormous a power, they increased their privileges, exonerated them from\r\ntaxes, and placed such premiums of gain and protection upon the monkish\r\nhabit, that the highest amongst the nobility, and many of the princes,\r\nembraced the clerical profession, and added their rich possessions to\r\nthe revenues of the church. To such an extravagance was this estimation\r\nof the benefits of the cowl carried, that the majority of the grand\r\nprinces took vows before their death, and died in the retired sanctuaries\r\nof the religious houses. The monks of the Greek religion, loaded with\r\nthe spoils of friends and enemies, lived in fortified dwellings, like\r\nthe nobles of other lands, and were defended by formidable retinues.\r\nThe primate held a court superior in magnificence to that of the grand\r\nprince, and surrounded by boyars, guards, and all the luxuries of the\r\neast, he possessed almost unlimited power over life and death; he was\r\nthe first person who was consulted on all questions of difficulty, and,\r\nas a means of exhibiting the supremacy of his station, he instituted\r\npublic ceremonies, at which the princes assisted, holding the bridle\r\nof the ass on which he rode. This tendency of the church to outgrow\r\nthe space wherein its roots were laid, was greatly forwarded by the\r\nfertilizing contributions which flowed in upon it from all quarters.\r\nWhenever a phenomenon in the physical world alarmed the superstitions\r\nof the people, the major part of the population bequeathed their wealth\r\nto the monasteries, with the hope of propitiating the favour of Heaven\r\nand securing happiness in the next world. The corruptions of the church\r\nof Rome had already crept into the administration of the Greek faith.\r\nThe system of donations that prevailed in Papal Italy, where even the\r\nkingdoms of earth were bartered for the kingdom of heaven, had set an\r\nexample of which the Russian clergy were not slow to avail themselves.\r\nIt was, perhaps, a natural conclusion that the clemency of the Godhead\r\ncould be purchased in a country where earthly justice and exemptions from\r\npunishments were sold for pecuniary considerations.\r\n\r\nBut the lenity and favour shown by the Tatars to the Greek clergy did not\r\nproduce the effect upon which they calculated. The Tatars, accustomed to\r\nrule people of different religions, and possessing within themselves no\r\necclesiastical foundations, for their wandering mode of life prevented\r\ntheir priesthood from resolving itself into a corporation, viewed with\r\ncomparative indifference the spreading institutions and growing strength\r\nof the church. They only contemplated in the honours and advantages they\r\nheaped upon it, the policy of gaining over to their side a powerful\r\nbody of auxiliaries. But the indestructible spirit of Christianity\r\nshrunk from a union with the creed of the pagans; while the barbarous\r\nintolerance of the Tatars furnished a further motive to array the priests\r\nagainst the enemies of their religion and their country. They knew that\r\nin the grand princedom resided the sole power by which the Tatars were\r\nultimately to be driven out of the land; they saw that to arm that\r\npower with sufficient means it was necessary to enrich its treasury, to\r\nenlarge its bounds, and to attract within the circle of its sway the\r\nallegiance of the whole of the Russian principalities; they perceived\r\nin the civil commotions that oppressed the empire a constant source of\r\ninternal weakness, and they dedicated their energies and their influence\r\nto the one object of rendering the grand prince supreme. Mohammedanism\r\nassailed them on the one hand, and the papal church on the other: they\r\nwanted a rallying point of resistance against both; and they could only\r\nfind it in the elevation of the throne to an imperial height. Hence, the\r\nclergy supported the principle of legitimacy, which by its consistency\r\nand perpetuity was calculated to promote the progressive ascension\r\nof the princely authority; and thus by degrees, and the inevitable\r\nprogress of an active doctrine that survived through every obstacle, the\r\nchurch became blended with the state; and the policy of the priesthood,\r\nexercising its subtle influence governed and directed the motions of the\r\ncivil jurisdiction.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARACTER AND AIMS OF IVAN\r\n\r\nIvan the Great, favoured by such auspicious dispositions on the part of\r\nthe clergy, and by the rapid coherence of the principalities, ascended\r\nthe throne in 1462, at the age of twenty-two. He was a man of great\r\ncunning and prudence, and was remarkable for indomitable perseverance,\r\nwhich carried him triumphantly to the conclusions of his designs in a\r\nspirit of utter indifference to the ruin or bad faith that tracked his\r\nprogress. Such a man alone, who was prepared to sacrifice the scruples\r\nof honour and the demands of justice, was fit to meet the difficulties\r\nby which the grand princedom was surrounded. He saw them all clearly,\r\nresolved upon the course he should take; and throughout a long reign,\r\nin which the paramount ambition of rendering Russia independent and\r\nthe throne supreme was the leading feature of his policy, he pursued\r\nhis plans with undeviating consistency. But that policy was not to be\r\naccomplished by open and responsible acts. The whole character of Ivan\r\nwas tinged with the duplicity of the churchmen who held so high a place\r\nin his councils. His proceedings were neither direct, nor at first\r\napparently conducive to the interests of the empire; but the great cause\r\nwas secretly advancing against all impediments. While he forbore to risk\r\nhis advantages, he left an opportunity for disunion amongst his enemies,\r\nby which he was certain to gain in the end. He never committed himself\r\nto a position of the security of which he was not sure; and he carried\r\nthis spirit of caution to such an extremity that many of the early years\r\nof his reign present a succession of timid and vacillating movements,\r\nthat more nearly resemble the subterfuges of a coward than the crafty\r\nartifices of a despot.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [1467-1472 A.D.]]\r\n\r\nThe objects of which he never lost sight were, to free himself from\r\nenemies abroad, and to convert the princedom at home into an autocracy.\r\nSo extensive a design could not have been effected by mere force of arms,\r\nfor he had so many domestic and foreign foes to meet at once, and so many\r\npoints of attack and defence to cover, that it was impossible to conduct\r\nso grand a project by military means alone. That which he could not\r\neffect, therefore, by the sword, he endeavoured to perform by diplomatic\r\nintrigue; and thus, between the occasional victories of his armies,\r\nand the still more powerful influence of his subtle policy, he reduced\r\nhis foes, and raised himself to an eminence to which none of his most\r\nambitious predecessors had aspired.\r\n\r\nThe powers against whom he had to wage this double war of arms and\r\ndiplomacy were the Tatars and Lithuanians, beyond the frontier; and the\r\nindependent republics of Novgorod, Viatka, and Pskov, and the princes\r\nof the yet unsettled appanages within. The means he had at his command\r\nwere fully sufficient to have enabled him to subdue those princes of the\r\nblood who exhibited faint signs of discontent in their appanages, and who\r\ncould have been easily reached through the widely diffused agency of the\r\nboyars; but the obstinate republics of the north were more difficult of\r\naccess. They stood boldly upon their independence, and every attempt to\r\nreduce them was followed by as fierce a resistance, and by such a lavish\r\noutlay of the wealth which their commercial advantages had enabled them\r\nto amass, that the task was one of extraordinary difficulty. Kazan, too,\r\nthe first and greatest of the Tatar cities, claimed a sovereignty over\r\nthe republics, which Ivan was afraid to contest, lest that which was but\r\na vague and empty claim might end in confirmed authority. It was better\r\nto permit the insolent republicans to maintain their entire freedom, than\r\nto hazard by indiscretion their transference to the hands of those Tatars\r\nwho were loosened from the parent stock.\r\n\r\nHis first act, therefore, was to acknowledge, directly or indirectly,\r\naccording to the nature of their different tenures, the rights of all\r\nhis foes within and without. He appeared to admit the justice of things\r\nas he found them; betrayed his foreign enemies into a confidential\r\nreliance upon his acquiescence in their exactions; and even yielded\r\nwithout a murmur to an abuse of those pretensions to which he affected to\r\nsubmit, but which he was secretly resolved to annihilate. This plausible\r\nconformity procured him time to prepare and mature his designs; and so\r\ninsidiously did he pursue his purpose, that he extended that time by\r\na servility which nearly forfeited the attachment of the people. The\r\nimmediate object of consideration was obviously the Golden Horde, because\r\nall the princes and republics, and even the Poles and Lithuanians, were\r\ninterested in any movement that was calculated to embarrass the common\r\nenemy. Ivan’s policy was to unite as many of his enemies as he could\r\nagainst a single one, and finally to subdue them all by the aid of each\r\nother. Had he ventured upon any less certain course, he must have risked\r\na similar combination against himself. He began by withholding the\r\nordinary tribute from the khan, but without exhibiting any symptoms of\r\ninallegiance. He merely evaded the tax, while he acknowledged the right;\r\nand his dissimulation succeeded in blinding the Tatar, who still believed\r\nthat he held the grand prince as a tributary, although he did not\r\nreceive his tribute. The khan, completely deceived, not only permitted\r\nthis recusancy to escape with impunity, but was further prevailed upon\r\nto withdraw the Tatar residents, and their retinues, and the Tatar\r\nmerchants, who dwelt in Moscow, and who infested with the haughty bearing\r\nof masters even the avenues of the Kremlin.[g]\r\n\r\n\r\nIVAN VASILIEVITCH MARRIES THE GREEK PRINCESS SOPHIA (1472 A.D.)\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [1472 A.D.]]\r\n\r\nBy completing the work of his predecessors in destroying the independence\r\nof the townships and the appanaged princes, Ivan created the empire\r\nof Moscow. The form of government of this empire and all the outward\r\nsurroundings of power were greatly influenced by the marriage of Ivan\r\nto Sophia, daughter of Thomas Palæologus, and niece of the last emperor\r\nof Byzantium, who brought to Moscow the customs and traditions of the\r\nByzantine Empire. Ivan had lost his first wife in 1467, and two years\r\nlater the question arose of his marriage with the Greek princess. Thomas\r\nPalæologus had retired with his family to Rome; the idea of finding\r\na bridegroom for his daughter belongs to the Greek vissarion, one of\r\nthe most zealous partisans of the union and at that time cardinal. The\r\ncardinal and pope had naturally in view the finding of a new champion\r\nagainst the then terrible Turks, and at the same time of bringing Russia\r\ninto the union. The envoy sent to Moscow was a Greek by the name of Iuri,\r\nwho said that Sophia had several suitors, whom she had refused because\r\nshe did not wish to enter the Latin church. Ivan, after taking counsel\r\nwith his mother and boyars, sent to Rome Karl Friazin (whose brother\r\nIvan had been coiner of money at the court of Moscow) to see the bride\r\nand confer with the pope; the latter gave his consent and required that\r\nboyars should be sent from Moscow to fetch the bride; Friazin was sent\r\nfor the bride and carried on the negotiations; finally in June, 1472,\r\nSophia, accompanied by the papal legate, left Rome. She was met with\r\nhonours at Pskov in November of the same year, and was afterwards greeted\r\nwith like homage at Novgorod. When Sophia was drawing near Moscow, warm\r\ndisputes arose in the grand prince’s council as to whether it could be\r\nallowed that a Latin crucifix should be carried before the legate. The\r\nmetropolitan declared that in the event of it being permitted, the pope’s\r\nlegate should enter by one gate and he at another: it is unbecoming to\r\nus to hear of such a thing, not to say witness it, for he who shows\r\nhonour and love to another religion offends his own; finally the legate\r\nhad to enter without the crucifix. On the day of the entry the marriage\r\nceremony took place (November 12), after which the legate presented his\r\ncredentials and entered into a controversy with the metropolitan Philip,\r\nwho called to his aid the scribe Nikita Popovitch. The chronicler says\r\nthat being in despair of getting the better of the Russian scribes, the\r\nlegate gave up the controversy, saying that he had no books with him.[b]\r\n\r\nThe marriage of the sovereign of Moscow with the Greek princess was\r\nan event of great importance in Russian history. Properly speaking,\r\nan alliance with the Byzantine emperors was not a novelty, and such\r\nmarriages, excepting the first of them--that of St. Vladimir--had no\r\nimportant consequences and changed nothing essential in Russian life.\r\nBut the marriage of Ivan with Sophia was concluded under peculiar\r\ncircumstances. In the first place, his bride did not come from Greece,\r\nbut from Italy, and her marriage opened the way to intercourse between\r\nMuscovite Russia and the west. In the second place, the empire of\r\nByzantium had ceased to exist, and the customs, political conceptions,\r\nthe manners and ceremonies of court life, deprived of their original\r\nsoil, sought a fresh field and found it in a country of a like\r\nfaith--Russia. As long as Byzantium had existed, although Russia adopted\r\nher entire ecclesiastical system, yet in political respects she had\r\nalways remained purely Russian, and the Greeks had no inclination to\r\ntransform Russia into a Byzantium; now, however, that Byzantium no longer\r\nexisted, the idea arose that Greece ought to re-incarnate herself in\r\nRussia and that the Russian monarchy ought to be a continuation by right\r\nof succession of Byzantium, in the same degree as the Russian Church\r\nwas by order of succession bone of the bone and flesh of the flesh of\r\nthe Greek church. It happened opportunely that eastern Russia had freed\r\nherself from the subjugation of the Tatars precisely at the time when\r\nByzantium was enslaved by the Turks, and there arose the hope that the\r\nyouthful Russian monarchy, strengthened and consolidated, would become\r\nthe chief mover in the liberation of Greece.\r\n\r\nThe marriage of Sophia with the Russian grand prince thus acquired the\r\nsignification of a transfer of the hereditary rights of the descendants\r\nof Palæologus to the ruling house of Russia. It is true that Sophia had\r\nbrothers who had otherwise disposed of their hereditary rights; one of\r\nthem, Manuel, had submitted to the Turkish sultan, another, Andrew, had\r\ntwice visited Moscow, but had not stayed there long, and had gone to\r\nItaly and sold his hereditary rights, first to the French king Charles\r\nVIII, and afterwards to the Spanish Ferdinand the Catholic. But in the\r\neyes of the orthodox a transfer of the rights of the Byzantine monarchs\r\nto Catholic kings could not be regarded as lawful; and such being the\r\ncase a far greater right was represented by Sophia, who had remained\r\nfaithful to orthodoxy, who was the wife of an orthodox sovereign, who\r\nmust become and did become the mother and ancestress of his successors,\r\nand who during her lifetime earned the reproaches of the pope and his\r\npartisans, who had been greatly mistaken in counting on her mediation to\r\nbring Muscovite Russia into the Florentine union.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE GROWTH OF AUTOCRACY\r\n\r\nThe first visible and outward sign of the fact that Russia came to regard\r\nherself as a successor to Greece, was the adoption of the two-headed\r\neagle, the arms of the eastern Roman Empire, which thenceforth became the\r\narms of Russia. From that time much in Russia was changed and assumed a\r\nByzantine likeness; the change was not effected suddenly, but proceeded\r\nduring the entire reign of Ivan Vasilievitch and continued after his\r\ndeath. In the court household the high-sounding title of czar was\r\nintroduced, and the custom of kissing the monarch’s hand. Court ranks\r\nwere established also: master of the stables, master of the horse, and\r\nchamberlains (the latter, however, appeared only at the end of Ivan’s\r\nreign). The importance of the boyars as the highest class of society\r\nfell before an autocratic sovereign; all became equal, all alike were\r\nhis slaves. The honourable appellation of boyar was bestowed by the\r\ngrand prince as a reward for services; besides the boyars there was\r\nalso created a somewhat lower rank--that of the Iokolnitchi[24]--the\r\ncommencement of the Russian hierarchy of ranks. To the time of Ivan\r\nVasilievitch may also be attributed the establishment of bureaus\r\n(_prikazi_) with their secretaries and clerks. But most important and\r\nessential of all was the change in the dignity attaching to the grand\r\nprince, strongly to be felt and clearly visible in the actions of the\r\ndeliberate Ivan Vasilievitch; the grand prince had become an autocratic\r\nsovereign. Even in his predecessors do we notice an approximation to\r\nthis, but the first autocrat in the full sense of the word was Ivan\r\nVasilievitch, and he became so especially after his marriage to Sophia.\r\nFrom that time all his activity was consistently and unswervingly\r\nconsecrated to the strengthening of monarchy and autocracy.[c]\r\n\r\n\r\nSUBJUGATION OF THE REPUBLICS\r\n\r\nFrom the beginning of Ivan’s reign there was no change in political\r\npolicy; the old system of the gradual annihilation of the independent\r\nrepublican communities and appanaged princes continued, as well as\r\nthe old waiting policy in regard to the Tatars, which was based on\r\nthe exploitation of their internecine quarrels. Vasili had already\r\nprepared to deal the final blow to Novgorod, but had been prevented by\r\nthe interference of Archbishop Jonas; and the inhabitants, remembering\r\nthis, were in expectation of fresh action on the part of Moscow and\r\nsought support from other quarters. Such support could at that time be\r\nafforded them only by the grand prince of Lithuania, but it was difficult\r\nfor the people of Novgorod to enter into relations with him, because\r\nsuch relations would have the signification of a betrayal of orthodoxy.\r\nThis being well understood at Moscow, the rulers there hastened to\r\nforestall the danger: the grand prince wrote a letter to Archbishop\r\nJonas, declaring to him that the Lithuanian metropolitan Gregory was a\r\ndisciple of Isidore and a defender of the “unia,” and that relations\r\nwith him must not be entered into. In order to support the right on his\r\nside, the metropolitan of Moscow in the interests of Novgorod rejected\r\nthe solicitations of the people of Pskov who wished to have a separate\r\nbishop; the grand prince himself left unheeded the insults shown to men\r\nof Moscow in Novgorod, and even the infringement of his ancient princely\r\nrights. Occupied in a war with Kazan, he only exchanged embassies with\r\nNovgorod.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [1475 A.D.]]\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the party in Novgorod which was hostile to Moscow became more\r\nand more rampant; the leaders of this party were the Boretski, the\r\nchildren of the dead burgomaster (_posadnick_). They were incited by\r\ntheir mother Martha, who as an “honourable widow” enjoyed great esteem;\r\nthe Boretski were wealthy and had great influence in the _vetché_. At\r\ntheir instigation Prince Michael Olelkovitch, brother of Simon, prince\r\nof Kiev, was invited to come from Lithuania to Novgorod. Previously the\r\nLithuanian princes that had been called upon to serve Novgorod had lived\r\ntogether with the Muscovite lieutenants; now the question was already\r\ndifferent and the Lithuanian party decided to go further. At the end of\r\n1470 Jonas died and the question was raised in the vetché of having the\r\narchbishop nominated in Lithuania; this time, however, the archbishop\r\nTheophilus was chosen and his partisans stood out for his consecration\r\nin Moscow and were successful, so that a consent to his passing through\r\nwas obtained from the grand prince. An ambassador coming from Pskov with\r\nthe news that the grand prince called the men of Pskov upon Novgorod,\r\nand offering proposals of mediation, again gave preponderance to the\r\nLithuanian party. The vetché assembled, and people in it began to cry\r\nout: “We are free men of great Novgorod and the grand prince of Moscow\r\ndoes us many wrongs and much injustice; we are for the king of Poland;”\r\nwith the help of the “wicked peasants of the vetché” they gained the\r\nvictory, and an embassy was sent to Casimir, the result of which was a\r\nconvention for the submission of Novgorod to him. Olelkovitch soon left\r\nNovgorod, having wronged the provinces of Novgorod in various ways.\r\nThe grand prince still wished to try peaceful measures and sent his\r\nambassador to Novgorod with an exhortation, and the metropolitan Philip\r\nsent a letter of admonishment. After the failure of this embassy the\r\ngrand prince assembled his council (_douma_) and proposed the question:\r\nShall we march on Novgorod now or wait until winter? It was well known\r\nthat a march to Novgorod in summer was very difficult, yet it was decided\r\nto go at once, and a declaration of war was sent. In July, 1471, the\r\ngrand prince himself with troops from Moscow and Tver, and accompanied\r\nby his brothers, set out from Moscow; the men of Pskov joined the Moscow\r\ntroops on the way. A religious character was given to the expedition.\r\nBefore starting, the grand prince went to pray in the cathedral of\r\nMoscow, and chroniclers liken this expedition to that of Gideon against\r\nthe Midianites and that of Dmitri against Mamai.\r\n\r\nAfter the battle at Tskorost, Prince Kholmski, a voyevod of Ivan,\r\ndecisively defeated the people of Novgorod at the river Shelon (July\r\n14th, 1475?) and the same day the Moscow voyevod Obrazets defeated\r\nPrince Vasili Shuiski, who was in the service of Novgorod, at the river\r\nShilenga, and subjugated all the Dvinsk territories; “everywhere the\r\nLord God helped the grand prince to defend his rights.” Nothing remained\r\nfor Novgorod but to submit, for Casimir, occupied with his own affairs,\r\nhad not come to her defence. Ivan, coming after his armies, first had\r\nBoretski and three other prisoners put to death, then he relented,\r\naccepted the petition of Theophilus which was supported by a letter from\r\nthe metropolitan, took a ransom of 15,500 roubles from Novgorod, and\r\nconcluded a treaty by which the inhabitants were bound not to be subject\r\nto Lithuania and to have their archbishop nominated at Moscow.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [1477-1479 A.D.]]\r\n\r\nIn October, 1475, Ivan visited Novgorod and remained there until\r\nFebruary, 1476. Received with honours and gifts by great Novgorod and\r\nher dignitaries, the grand prince administered justice as of old;\r\nthe Slavnovski and Nikitinski appeared with a complaint against the\r\nhonourable burgomaster (_posadnick_), Vasili Annanin, and nineteen other\r\nboyars who had attacked and robbed them; a similar complaint was brought\r\nby the boyars Ponarin against other boyars who had made incursions into\r\ntheir lands and robbed them; for such incursions were of very frequent\r\noccurrence in Novgorod. Ivan sent the guilty persons to be imprisoned in\r\nMoscow, observing in his judgment all the ancient forms, and requiring\r\nthat with his commissaries there should also be sent commissaries from\r\nNovgorod; it was also then that he allowed the authorities of Novgorod\r\nto conclude, as in ancient times, a treaty with Sweden. In 1477\r\ncomplainants from Novgorod came to Moscow; “Such a thing,” says the\r\nchronicle, “had never happened before since the beginning of Novgorod\r\nand since it began to have grand princes from the house of Rurik.” Their\r\ncoming was quite comprehensible; the smaller folk were persuaded that it\r\nwas only by appealing to the tribunal of the grand prince that they could\r\nobtain redress against the greater, and therefore they had recourse to\r\nhim. Such a result having been attained, it only remained to await the\r\nfirst pretext in order to put an end to the independence of Novgorod. The\r\noccasion soon presented itself; in 1477 the envoys from the bishop and\r\nfrom all Novgorod, Nazar of Podvoiski and Zacharias, the secretary of the\r\nvetché, called Ivan and his son, young Ivan, _gospodá_ and not lords,[25]\r\nas had always been previously done, and the grand prince sent ambassadors\r\nto Novgorod to demand the confirmation of this title. Tumults, brawls,\r\nand even murder took place in Novgorod, and the ambassador was sent away\r\nwith an insulting message. Then Ivan assembled his troops to go against\r\nNovgorod; he called upon Tver and Pskov for aid, ordered his brothers to\r\nassemble, and sending before him the Tatar prince, Daniar Kasimovitch,\r\nhe set out himself. The people of Novgorod began to negotiate while the\r\ngrand prince was still on the way; they had even tried to do so before,\r\nbut Ivan, properly calculating that a satisfactory result could only be\r\nobtained by a warlike demonstration, avoided negotiations. All December,\r\n1477, and the beginning of January, 1478, passed in negotiations; finally\r\nNovgorod submitted when her defender, Prince Vasili Shuiski, bent his\r\nknee[26] before Ivan and refused to serve Novgorod any longer. Novgorod\r\nsubmitted to the “entire will” of Ivan; the vetché was abolished and its\r\ngreat bell taken to Moscow to ring with other bells; estates were taken\r\nfrom the monasteries, and allotted to the grand prince, the first example\r\nof secularisation: till then the princes had not possessed estates\r\nin Novgorod. When he left, Ivan took with him the boyars and Martha\r\nBoretski, who is said to have died at Staritza.\r\n\r\nIt is reported that in 1479 Novgorod again tried to enter into relations\r\nwith Casimir, and taking advantage of threatening danger from the Golden\r\nHorde, re-established the ancient form of government, and that the grand\r\nprince came to the town, ordered the gates to be opened, frustrated the\r\nattempt at the very beginning, and took away many of the inhabitants with\r\nhim. This account is confirmed by the fact that other chronicles speak\r\nof the arrival of the grand prince at Novgorod, and of the imprisonment\r\nof the archbishop Theophilus. The loss of their independence was a heavy\r\nblow to the people, and as a consolation legends were composed of the\r\nfoolishness of the first bishop sent from Moscow, Sergius by name, and of\r\nthe flame that came out of the tomb of St. Bartholomew of Khoutinski and\r\nburned the feet of the grand prince.\r\n\r\nViatka, whose inhabitants refused to help the Moscow troops in the war\r\nagainst Kazan in 1469, was definitively subdued in 1489. The policy of\r\nthe transfer of the natives to the ancient provinces and of sending\r\nothers to take their places, was also applied to Viatka.\r\n\r\nPskov remained submissive and thereby preserved a shadow of independence;\r\nbut the grand prince kept a zealous watch over all that was done there\r\nand did not allow any aspirations to greater independence. Although\r\nconsenting that the inhabitants might ask for any prince they wished, he\r\ndid not approve of any wilful change of princes, and strongly took the\r\npart of Prince Iaroslav Obolenski, who had had a quarrel with Pskov and\r\nwhom the people wished to get rid of; it was only the desire to have done\r\nwith Novgorod that induced the grand prince to give way to Pskov and give\r\nthem a new lieutenant--Prince Vasili Shuiski (1477). When, later, Ivan\r\nnamed his son Vasili grand prince of Novgorod and Pskov, the inhabitants\r\nsent an envoy begging that they might be separated, but the grand prince\r\nreplied wrathfully that he would give the principality to whomsoever he\r\nliked; Pskov also endeavoured in vain to get its province separated from\r\nthe rule of the bishop of Novgorod.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [1482-1485 A.D.]]\r\n\r\nTowards the appanaged princes Ivan pursued the same policy as towards\r\nthe townships. Vasili, prince of Riazan, had already been taken by\r\nVasili the Dark to be educated in Moscow; in 1464 he was sent back to\r\nRiazan, returned to Moscow, married a sister of the grand prince and went\r\nback to Riazan. He died in 1483, leaving two sons: Ivan and Theodore.\r\nIvan, as grand prince, concluded a treaty with Moscow by which he was\r\nplaced on a level with the brother of the grand prince of Moscow, Andrew\r\nVasilievitch. In 1496 a treaty was concluded between the brothers, by\r\nwhich the younger was bound, in case he were to die childless, to leave\r\nhis share to his elder brother; but Prince Theodore survived his brother\r\nand bequeathed his share to the grand prince of Moscow. In the year\r\n1500 Ivan, grand prince of Riazan, died, leaving a young son under the\r\nguardianship of his mother and grandmother, who were entirely subservient\r\nto the prince of Moscow.\r\n\r\nSince 1461 the prince of Tver, Michael Borisovitch, was Ivan’s\r\nbrother-in-law. When he came to the throne Ivan concluded a treaty with\r\nhim, but although Michael helped Ivan against Novgorod, yet in their\r\nmutual relations the signs that usually preceded the fall of a separate\r\nprincipality might be observed. In 1476 certain boyars of Tver went over\r\nto Moscow. In 1484 it became known in Moscow that the prince of Tver\r\nhad concluded a treaty with Casimir and married his granddaughter. Ivan\r\nsent troops to lay waste the districts around Tver; Michael hastened to\r\nappease him and concluded a new treaty with him, by which the prince\r\nof Tver was placed on a level with the second brother of the Moscow\r\ngrand prince and bound himself not to appeal to Lithuania without his\r\nconsent. Meanwhile the departure of the boyars from Tver continued and\r\nIvan encouraged them by his policy; in the event of frontier disputes,\r\nif the men of Tver were injured they could not obtain justice, but if\r\nthose of Moscow were injured, Ivan rigorously demanded satisfaction.\r\nMichael entered into relations with Casimir, but the envoy was seized,\r\nand Ivan sent his troops to Tver; the town surrendered, and Michael fled\r\nto Lithuania. In 1463 the princes of Iaroslav ceded their domain to the\r\nMuscovite monarch, and in 1474 the princes of Rostov, who ruled over only\r\nhalf of Rostov, for the other half had already been acquired by Kalita,\r\nsold their half to the grand prince. Equally slowly and gradually did\r\nthe grand prince also crush the appanaged princes of Moscow; all these\r\nprinces were his brothers, with the exception of Michael Andreevitch\r\nVereiski (the son of Andrew Dmitrievitch, brother of Ivan of Mozhaisk).\r\nWith Michael Ivan concluded several treaties that gradually cut down his\r\nrights; finally by the treaty of 1482 Michael ceded, after his death,\r\nBelozero to the grand prince. There was no pretext for this annexation,\r\nbut one was soon found; desiring to make a present to his daughter-in-law\r\nHelen[27] (upon the occasion of the birth of his grandson Dmitri) of the\r\nornaments that had belonged to his first wife, Ivan learned that the\r\ngrand princess Sophia had given away much to her niece, who was married\r\nto a son of Michael named Vasili; the irritated grand prince then\r\nordered Vasili to be seized, but he fled to Lithuania; whereupon Ivan\r\ntook Vereia from Michael and only returned it to him as a possession for\r\nlife. Michael Andreevitch died in 1485, leaving his domains by will to\r\nthe grand prince. The appanages of the brothers also little by little,\r\nfor one reason or another, were joined to the grand principality; in 1472\r\nIuri Vasilievitch, of Dmitriev, died, without leaving any testamentary\r\ndisposition of his territory; the grand prince took possession of it; the\r\nbrothers were angered, but satisfying them with some provinces, the grand\r\nprince concluded a treaty with two of them, Andrew of Uglitch and Boris\r\nof Volotsk, by which they recognised the priority of their nephew Ivan\r\nthe Younger and renounced the succession after their brother.\r\n\r\nIn 1480 the younger brothers again rose against the elder, and Prince\r\nObolenski Liko went from Moscow to enter the service of Boris; Ivan,\r\nprobably learning of his brother’s relations with the people of Novgorod,\r\nordered Prince Obolenski to be seized at the court of Boris. The princes\r\nwent to Rzhev, thence to the boundary of Lithuania, and entered into\r\nrelations with Casimir, who however did not help them. Until then they\r\nhad rejected negotiations, but seeing Casimir’s inaction, they asked for\r\nthe intercession of their mother, but Ivan refused them; they also sought\r\nsupport in Pskov, but were unsuccessful. The invasion of Ahmed induced\r\nIvan to make peace with his brothers, and Andrew received a part of the\r\nappanage of Iuriev. Andrew the younger died in 1481, leaving his domain\r\nto the grand prince. In 1484 the mother of the grand prince, who had in\r\nsome degree restrained the dissensions of the brothers, died, and in\r\n1486 Ivan bound his brothers by a new treaty to renounce their rights of\r\ninheritance in regard to appanages. In 1491 Andrew was seized and thrown\r\ninto prison, where he died in 1494; his sons were imprisoned with him.\r\nBoris also died soon after, leaving his domains to his sons Theodore\r\nand Ivan: the latter, dying in 1504, left his part by will to the grand\r\nprince, whom he calls “gossudar”[28] (sovereign or sire).\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FINAL OVERTHROW OF THE TATARS\r\n\r\nThe most conspicuous event in the reign of Ivan--the casting off of the\r\nTatar yoke--is connected by many with his marriage. But it should be\r\nborne in mind that this was the ancient and sacred ideal of the Moscow\r\nprinces, to the fulfilment of which all their desires had long been\r\ndirected, and for which they had been gradually preparing the means.\r\nSuch an event cannot be explained by one merely accidental circumstance,\r\nalthough it is impossible not to agree that the dependence of her husband\r\nupon the Tatar khan must have been humiliating to the proud Sophia, and\r\ntherefore it cannot be denied that there is some truth in the traditions\r\nrelating to this subject. But in any event the circumstance was a merely\r\naccessory one, for it is known that long before this the expression: “May\r\nthe Lord cause the horde to perish,” was to be met with in the wills of\r\nthe Moscow princes; the same expression also occurs in the testament\r\nof Vasili the Dark. The Moscow princes had prepared for this by taking\r\ninto their service Tatar princes, in whom they saw the best means of\r\nfighting their enemies, the Tatars. And in this work bequeathed to him\r\nby his forefathers, Ivan Vasilievitch remained true to the deliberate,\r\npersistent policy of his predecessors, never losing sight of his aim, but\r\nnever hurrying too much in its attainment.\r\n\r\nAt the time when Ivan Vasilievitch began to reign, the Tatar horde no\r\nlonger constituted an undivided kingdom; previously it had been sometimes\r\ndivided and then again reunited, but at this period it was definitively\r\ndivided into three chief hordes; the Golden, the Kazanese, and the\r\nCrimean, at the head of the last of which, during the reign of Vasili the\r\nDark, was Azi Girai.\r\n\r\nIvan’s policy consisted in exploiting one horde against the other and\r\none pretender against the other. Of the principal Tatar hordes, the\r\nnearest and weakest was the Kazan horde, and it was the first which he\r\nattempted to bring under his influence. In 1467 the vassal Kasim, who\r\nwas in the service of Ivan, was invited by some of the Tatar princes\r\n(_mourzas_) to come to Kazan, but the khan Ibrahim met him at the Volga\r\nand prevented him from crossing the river; after insignificant mutual\r\ndevastations in 1469 a great army was sent against Kazan, composed of\r\nsons of the boyars and Moscow troops, under the leadership of Constantine\r\nBezzubtiev. The troops marched right up to the town, but beyond ravaging\r\nits territory nothing was done. In the summer of the same year, two of\r\nthe grand prince’s brothers, Iuri and Andrew the Big, marched against\r\nKazan, besieged the town, and Ibrahim hastened to conclude peace “at\r\nthe entire will of the grand prince and his voyevods,” and liberated\r\nthe prisoners that had been taken during the preceding forty years. For\r\neight years there was peace, but in 1479 the Kazanese army made a raid\r\non Russian territory (at Ustiug and Viatka). To avenge this, troops were\r\nsent from Moscow under the leadership of the voyevod Vasili Obrazets,\r\nwhile from the other side came the men of Viatka and Ustiug and besieged\r\nKazan. Ibrahim again concluded peace “according to the will of the grand\r\nprince.” At the death of Ibrahim disturbances arose in Kazan; one of his\r\nsons Ali Khan or Alegam, from the younger wife, became khan, and Muhammed\r\nAmin, the son of the elder wife, came to Moscow and asked for help\r\nagainst his brother.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [1487 A.D.]]\r\n\r\nIn 1487 troops were despatched from Moscow under the leadership of Daniel\r\nKholmski, the town was taken, Alegam made prisoner, and Muhammed Amin\r\nestablished on the throne of Kazan; he was so entirely subject to Moscow\r\nthat he asked the grand prince’s permission to marry, and even paid a\r\ncertain tribute to Moscow. In 1496 the people of Kazan, dissatisfied with\r\nMuhammed Amin, called in the Nogaians; the Moscow troops came to the\r\naid of the khan, but hardly had they been dismissed before the Nogaian\r\nprince Mamuk came to Kazan, and the khan fled to Moscow. Mamuk, fearing\r\ntreason, seized the very persons who had called for him, and in general\r\nbegan to act arbitrarily. When he went to attack the princes of Arsk, the\r\ninhabitants of Kazan shut the gates against him and sent to Moscow to\r\nask for another khan, only not Muhammed Amin. Ivan sent them Muhammed’s\r\nbrother, Abdul Letiv, and gave to the former Koshira and Serpukhov as\r\nfiefs. In 1502, at the complaint of the people of Kazan, Abdul Letiv\r\nwas deposed and banished to Belozero. Muhammed Amin again returned, but\r\nhe was already dissatisfied with Moscow, and in this attitude he was\r\nsupported by his wife, the widow of Alegam. In 1505, under the pretext\r\nthat the grand prince had not satisfied his complaints, Muhammed Amin\r\nplundered some Russian merchants that had come to the fair and marched\r\nagainst Nijni-Novgorod; Ivan died soon after, before he was able to\r\nrevenge himself.\r\n\r\nThe extension of the Russian possessions in the east was accomplished\r\nin another way; in 1472 the grand prince sent troops to the territory\r\nof Perm--which was numbered amongst the Novgorodian possessions--and\r\nits prince was taken prisoner; but until 1505 native princes were\r\nleft to reign there, and it was only in that year that Prince Vasili\r\nKover was sent to Perm as lieutenant. The continual incursions of the\r\nVoguls obliged Ivan to send troops to the Ugrian territory and Prince\r\nKurbski even crossed the Ural. While leaving there native princes, Ivan\r\nnevertheless included the lands of Perm and Ugria in his title. With the\r\nGolden Horde Ivan did not begin war, although from the very beginning\r\nhe did not pay tribute punctually. Ivan’s enemy, the grand prince of\r\nLithuania, incited the Tatars against Moscow, and in 1471 Casimir called\r\nupon Ahmed to rise against the grand prince of Moscow; Ahmed however took\r\na whole year to assemble his troops, and meanwhile during the migration\r\nof the Tatars from Sarai, which took place every summer, the people of\r\nViatka came and plundered it. In 1472 Ahmed at last assembled his troops\r\nand took Alexin, but on meeting the grand prince’s brothers with a strong\r\narmy at the river Oka, he decided not to go further.\r\n\r\nAfter this, until 1480, the relations with the Golden Horde remained\r\nindefinite. Meanwhile intercourse was established with the Crimean\r\nhorde. Azi Girai died in 1467, and his son Nordovlat succeeded him, but\r\nhe was deposed by his brother Mengli Girai, and sought a refuge with\r\nCasimir. Ivan hastened to enter into relations with Mengli Girai through\r\nthe intermediation of a Jew of Feodosia, named Kokos; Mengli Girai,\r\nwithout breaking with Casimir, hastened to affirm these relations, which,\r\nhowever, were not very profitable, on account of the disturbances in the\r\nCrimea: the overthrow of Mengli Girai, by Aidar, the taking of Feodosia\r\nby the Turks, and the consequent destruction of the power of the Genoese\r\nin the Crimea; the capture of Mengli Girai and his liberation on the\r\ncondition of his becoming a Turkish tributary; the devastation of the\r\nCrimea by the son of Ahmed, and the rise of the czarevitch Zenebek to the\r\nsupreme power. It was only in 1479 that Mengli Girai finally established\r\nhimself in the Crimea and that his constant relations with Moscow\r\ncommenced.[29]\r\n\r\nIn 1480 the khan of the Golden Horde, Ahmed, incited by Casimir of\r\nLithuania, prepared to march against Russia. It is reported that about\r\nthat time Ivan refused to pay tribute, and that Sophia persuaded Ivan\r\nnot to go out to meet the Tatar envoys under the pretext of illness,\r\nand also by her cunning managed to destroy the hospice of the Tatars in\r\nthe Kremlin; it is said that she wrote to the wife of the khan telling\r\nher that she had had a vision in which she had been commanded to build\r\na church upon the very same site, and that the wife of the khan, who\r\nwas bribed with presents, managed to arrange the matter, and when the\r\nenvoys came there was no resting place to be found for them in Moscow.\r\nHowever this may be, it is certain that Ivan ceased to pay tribute.\r\nWhen he heard of Ahmed’s coming Ivan took up his position on the banks\r\nof the Oka, where he remained encamped from July until September; Ahmed\r\nbeing informed that the passage was here occupied, passed through the\r\nterritories of Lithuania and came to the Ugra, but here he also found\r\nthe passages occupied. The two armies remained in this position until\r\nNovember, and in the camp of the grand prince councils were held as to\r\nwhat should be done, for two parties had arisen, the one proposing to\r\noffer a ransom, while the other was for fighting; the famous letter\r\nof Archbishop Vassain of Moscow was written in the latter spirit. The\r\ngrand prince was sometimes at Kolomna and sometimes at Moscow to consult\r\nwith the metropolitan. When the frosts set in, by which the Tatars\r\ngreatly suffered, the grand prince commanded the Russians to fall back\r\non Kremenets, and meanwhile the Tatars fled.[30] Soon after his return\r\nto Sarai, Ahmed was killed by Ivak, prince of the Nogaian Tatars; and\r\nMengli Girai delivered Russia from the sons of Ahmed, with whom he was\r\nconstantly at war.\r\n\r\nThe relations with the Crimea, which were of importance in the struggle\r\nagainst the Golden Horde, were also of importance in the conflict with\r\nLithuania, and therefore Ivan constantly maintained them; but zealously\r\nlooked after his own interests. Of course many presents had to be given\r\nto the Tatars of the Crimea, although Ivan was economical to such a\r\ndegree that when sheep were given to the envoys he required the skins\r\nto be returned; but he spent his wealth all the more willingly for this\r\nobject, because Lithuania on her side also endeavoured to bribe the\r\nhorde, and a regular auction went on in the Crimea. The conquest of\r\nFeodosia by the Turks made it necessary for the Russians to enter into\r\nrelations with them for commercial reasons.\r\n\r\n\r\nAFFAIRS OF LITHUANIA\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [1494-1495 A.D.]]\r\n\r\nThe friendship of Mengli Girai, which had been of value to Ivan in\r\nhis conflicts with the Tatars, was of still greater importance in his\r\ndealings with Lithuania: Casimir, occupied with matters in the west,\r\nprincipally the establishment of his son on the throne of Bohemia, had\r\nincited both the inhabitants of Novgorod and the Golden Horde against\r\nIvan, while Ivan on his side had instigated Mengli Girai against\r\nLithuania and carried on relations with Casimir’s enemy, the king of\r\nHungary, Matthias (I) Corvinus. The quarrels of the border princes\r\nserving in the various armies, and their passing into the service of the\r\nMuscovite sovereign, served as the chief pretext for dissatisfaction. The\r\ngrand prince of Moscow, taking advantage of the fact that in the treaty\r\nconcluded between Vasili Vasilievitch and Casimir, the subject of the\r\nprinces had been treated very vaguely, began to receive those that passed\r\ninto his service. Thus he received together with their domains Prince\r\nI. M. Vorotinski, Prince I. V. Bielski, and Prince D. Th. Vorotinski.\r\nThe complaints at their desertions, the quarrels of the border princes,\r\nand in general, the frontier disagreements, were a continual subject of\r\nfriction, which occasionally went as far as slight skirmishes. In 1492\r\nCasimir died, and Lithuania chose as king his son Alexander, while Poland\r\ntook as king his other son John. Ivan again roused Mengli Girai against\r\nLithuania and sent detachments of his troops to lay waste the frontiers.\r\nPropositions of peace were sent from Lithuania and negotiations for a\r\nmarriage with one of the daughters of Ivan were entered upon. In Moscow\r\nit was insisted that the negotiations for peace should precede those\r\nfor marriage. Meanwhile more princes passed into the Russian service:\r\ntwo more princes Vorotinski, Prince Mezetski and Prince Viazemski; the\r\nfrontier incursions also continued. Finally in 1494 Alexander sent his\r\nambassadors to open negotiations both for peace and for the marriage.\r\nThe treaty concluded by them recognised the passing of the princes\r\ninto Ivan’s service, and what was of even greater importance, Ivan was\r\ntherein called sovereign of all Russia. Ivan then gave his consent to\r\nthe marriage of his daughter Helen with the grand prince of Lithuania,\r\nAlexander, stipulating however that a promise in writing should be given\r\nthat Helen would not be constrained to change her religion. When all this\r\nwas concluded, in 1495 Ivan sent Helen to Lithuania, giving her detailed\r\ninstructions. At the celebration of the marriage ceremony the Russian\r\nambassadors insisted that the ceremony should also be celebrated by an\r\northodox priest. But even from the very beginning it was manifest that\r\nseeds of discord lay hidden in this alliance. Alexander refused to build\r\nan orthodox church at his court, the boyars from Moscow who were with\r\nHelen were soon sent back, and finally Alexander ceased to give Ivan the\r\ntitle of sovereign of all Russia. The dissatisfaction grew, so that Ivan\r\nwrote to Mengli Girai: “If Alexander makes peace with you now, let us\r\nknow if he does not, also let us know, and we are with you, our brother.”\r\nMore princes passed into the service of the grand prince of Moscow,\r\namongst them Prince Simon Bielski, who asserted that persecutions against\r\northodoxy had commenced in Lithuania, and accused the bishop of Smolensk,\r\nJoseph, of co-operating with the Latins; Prince Simon Ivanovitch (son\r\nof Ivan of Mozhaisk) with Tchernigov, and Prince Vasili Ivanovitch (a\r\ngrandson of Shemiaka) with Novgorod Severski also came over (1499). Ivan\r\nsent Alexander a declaration of war; which began with incursions of the\r\nvassal princes, and on the 14th of July, 1500, Prince Daniel Kholmski,\r\nwho led the troops of Tver and Moscow, and the vassal Tatars and princes,\r\nmet the Lithuanian hetman Prince Constantine, defeated him, and took\r\nhim prisoner; on the other hand the grand prince’s son, Prince Dmitri\r\nIvanovitch, was unable to take Smolensk, and in general during four years\r\nwarlike action proceeded very feebly. Diplomatic intrigue was however\r\ncarried on with great activity; Moscow incited Mengli Girai against\r\nLithuania, who sent his sons to devastate Lithuania and Poland, in spite\r\nof tempting offers from Alexander.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [1495-1503 A.D.]]\r\n\r\nStephen of Moldavia, however, hearing of the disgrace and abandonment\r\ninto which his daughter Helen (widow of Ivan’s son) had fallen at the\r\ncourt of Moscow, made peace with Alexander; his enmity however did\r\nnot express itself in any important act. Far more important was the\r\nhelp given to Alexander by the Livonian grand master Plettenberg.\r\nNotwithstanding the truce which had been concluded, the continual\r\ncollisions between the Livonians and the inhabitants of Pskov did not\r\ncease. To avenge one of these incursions, Ivan sent twenty thousand\r\ntroops to Livonia who laid waste the land, captured towns, and carried\r\naway prisoners. A fresh truce was concluded (1482) which was extended in\r\n1493, but the Germans burned a certain Russian in Reval, and in answer\r\nto Russian complaints they replied that they would have burned the grand\r\nprince himself. This, it is supposed, explains the order given in 1495 to\r\nexpel the Hanseatic merchants and close their shops; but perhaps it is\r\nmore probable that the true reason was the treaty concluded with the king\r\nof Denmark, the enemy of the Hansa, who had asked for help against the\r\nSwedes, promising in the event of success to cede a part of Finland to\r\nRussia. Ivan sent an army against Sweden; but when the Danish king took\r\npossession of Sweden he gave nothing to Russia. Such being the relations\r\nbetween Russia and Livonia, it was quite natural that the grand master\r\nPlettenberg should hasten to conclude an alliance with Lithuania (1501).\r\nHe defeated the Russians near Izborsk, but did not take the town and\r\nturned back, while the Russians continued to ravage Livonia. Plettenberg\r\nagain entered Russian territory, besieged Pskov, and a battle took place\r\nnear Lake Smolin, but it was not decisive (1502). Meanwhile Alexander\r\nbegan negotiations for peace, partly through his brothers John (after\r\nwhose death in 1502 he occupied the throne of Poland) and Vladislav, and\r\npartly through embassies. Finally, in 1503, a treaty was concluded by\r\nwhich Russia kept all her acquisitions and Ivan was granted the title of\r\nsovereign of all Russia. A truce was then concluded with Livonia.\r\n\r\nRelations with the German Empire began under Ivan. They commenced with\r\nthe visit of the knight Poppel to Moscow; his narratives revealed Russia\r\nto Germany and he came as ambassador in 1489. Negotiations were opened\r\nfor the marriage of one of the grand prince’s daughters with Maximilian,\r\nthe son of the emperor Frederick; but nothing came of them. The hope that\r\nit might be possible to incite the emperor against the Polish king was\r\nalso frustrated, for Maximilian, who had pretensions to the throne of\r\nHungary, made peace with Vladislav.\r\n\r\n\r\nLAST YEARS OF IVAN; INHERITANCE LEFT TO HIS SONS\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [1505 A.D.]]\r\n\r\nThe last years of Ivan’s life were darkened by dissensions and intrigues\r\nin his family. In 1490 died Ivan the Younger, whom Ivan had proclaimed\r\nas his co-ruler. Two parties were then formed at the court; the boyars\r\nwished to see Dmitri, the son of Ivan the Younger, and Helen of Moldavia\r\nrecognised as heir; and Sophia designed her son Vasili (born in 1479)\r\nto be heir. A plot was laid against Dmitri; the sovereign heard of it,\r\nordered the conspirators to be executed, and was greatly angered with\r\nSophia, because he had been told that she had called in sorcerers to\r\nher aid (1497). Ivan then had his grandson crowned as his successor\r\n(1498); but soon Sophia again triumphed: a conspiracy was discovered in\r\nwhich were involved the princes Patrikëiev and Riapolovski; Prince Simon\r\nRiapolovski was beheaded and the Patrikëievs were forced to take holy\r\norders. It was supposed that the plot had been directed against Sophia.\r\nFrom the first Ivan did not “rejoice in his grandson,” and proclaimed\r\nVasili grand prince of Novgorod and Pskov, and in 1502 he had Dmitri\r\nplaced under arrest and declared Vasili his successor. The ambassadors to\r\nthe various courts were given orders to explain these occurrences.\r\n\r\nIvan died on the 27th of October, 1505, leaving a will and testament by\r\nwhich he bequeathed sixty-six of the most important towns to Vasili, and\r\nonly thirty to his remaining sons (Iuri, Dmitri, Simon, and Andrew);\r\nMoscow was divided into parts, Vasili receiving two-thirds and the others\r\none-third in all, but the elder was to have a share even in this third;\r\nthe younger brothers were commanded to esteem the elder as a father and\r\nto leave him their inheritance in the event of their dying childless.\r\nThus were changed the relations of the grand prince to the appanaged\r\nprinces! In the treaty concluded between the brothers Vasili and Iuri\r\nduring the lifetime of Ivan, Iuri calls his brother “lord,” and binds\r\nhimself to hold his principality “honourably and strictly.”\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPRECIATIONS OF IVAN VASILIEVITCH\r\n\r\n“He sits at home and sleeps, and his dominions augment, while I fight\r\nevery day and yet can hardly defend my frontiers.” Such were the words,\r\nit is said, with which Stephen of Moldavia frequently characterised his\r\ndaughter’s father-in-law, the grand prince Ivan Vasilievitch.\r\n\r\nThe observation is a remarkable one, for it represents the first and\r\nmost salient feature in the policy of the famous Russian monarch, who\r\nin himself concludes one period of Russian history and opens another.\r\nUnder him Russia passes out of its condition of exclusiveness; the west\r\nlearns that besides that Russia which is subject to Lithuania, there is\r\nalready another Russia, independent, powerful, and self-sufficing; it is\r\neven possible that at first this power was somewhat exaggerated, but it\r\nstruck contemporaries because it had, so to say, grown imperceptibly. It\r\nwould seem that all around it, as if submitting to some fatal influence,\r\nhastened to yield to this newborn power, while Russia herself did not\r\nhasten to announce herself, but only manifested herself at the last\r\nmoment when everything was already prepared for this manifestation, and\r\nwhen it only remained to gather the fully ripened fruits.\r\n\r\nS. M. Soloviov[h] compares Ivan to the fortunate heir of a long line\r\nof careful merchants who, having amassed a considerable capital,\r\nprovided their heir with the means for carrying on vast enterprises.\r\nN. I. Kostomarov’s[c] judgment is still more severe; he denies any\r\nmerit in Ivan, judges his activity by the requirements of other times\r\nand circumstances, and does not recognise in him and his descendants\r\nanything beyond their own ambitious and self-interested motives. Such\r\nviews were probably called forth as a contradiction to Karamzin, who on\r\nhis part, carried away by his dislike of the violence which--according\r\nto him--characterised the reform of Peter, placed Ivan above Peter.\r\nThe question “Lithuania or Moscow” was raised with entire firmness and\r\ndetermination by Ivan, for by the defence of Helen’s orthodoxy and\r\nby receiving into his service the Lithuanian princes who expatriated\r\nthemselves because of the persecution of orthodoxy, he became the\r\nprotector of the Greek church in Lithuania and thus strove to gain\r\ninfluence in its internal affairs. The secular policy of Russia was thus\r\nmarked out; it was also marked out by his insistence on the recognition\r\nof his title grand prince of all Russia and by his demand for the\r\nrestoration of Kiev; intercourse with the west also begins with him.[b]\r\n\r\nIn war Ivan showed a caution which his enemies called cowardice. As\r\nbehooved a prince, he conducted everything of importance himself. He\r\nexacted strict obedience, and was indefatigable in studying the thoughts\r\nand private circumstances of all important men in his kingdom, and even\r\nin foreign lands. The whole court and people trembled before his spirit\r\nand will; shy women are said to have fainted before his angry and fiery\r\nlook; seldom, if ever, did a petitioner dare to approach his throne,\r\nand none of the nobles at the princely table ventured to say a word to\r\nanother, or to leave his place, if the ruler, overcome by eating or\r\ndrinking, happened to fall asleep and remained so for many hours. All\r\nthe guests sat there dumb until Ivan awoke and gave them further orders,\r\neither to amuse or to leave him.\r\n\r\nHe was by no means prodigal of the life of his warriors; in fact, he\r\nexpected to gain more from the mistakes of his enemies than others do\r\nfrom battles; and he knew how to incite his enemies into committing\r\nmistakes, as well as to make use of them. He had the enlargement of his\r\nkingdom as much at heart as his absolute power. He boldly projected\r\nmany far-seeing plans, and sought with indefatigable zeal to realise\r\nthem. After he had broken the pride of Novgorod he considered nothing\r\nimpossible, and regarded his own will as the supreme command. We find no\r\ntrace of his having been accessible to the petitions of his subjects, or\r\nof his granting public audience days for the hearing of their requests\r\nand complaints.\r\n\r\nArbitrary power over the common people became stronger and prevailed, and\r\nofficials abused their power unpunished, for complainants and helpers\r\nwere wanting. To enlighten the minds of his people through the study of\r\nscience was not a part of his plans, perhaps because he may have thought\r\nthat it is easier for the tyrant to rule over rude slaves than over a\r\nfree-thinking and enlightened people. He must not be denied the merit of\r\nhaving raised great edifices at Moscow by means of foreign, especially\r\nItalian, architects; but vanity and love of show probably had more to do\r\nwith this than artistic sense and taste. The wide and majestic walls of\r\nthe venerable Kremlin with its battlements and towers, secret underground\r\npassages, and fortified gates, were to serve less as objects of beauty\r\nthan as means of protection against domestic and foreign enemies. Amongst\r\nthe useful arts he especially favoured those of the cannon founder and\r\nsilversmith; with the former he desired to terrify his enemies, and with\r\nthe latter to spread the renown of his power and glory. His greatest\r\nservices to the Russian state include, besides the regulation of the law\r\ncode, the increase of the state revenues, partly through the conquest of\r\nnew provinces, and partly through a better system of taxation, so that\r\nthe government could collect a treasure for unforeseen emergencies and\r\nwould become less dependent upon chance.\r\n\r\nThus there can be no doubt that as a prince Ivan ranks high and belongs\r\nto the number of those regents who decide the fate of their people\r\nand land for many years, and are a blessed or a cursed remembrance to\r\nposterity: but neither can it be denied that his greatness and fame lose\r\nmuch when we come to consider him as a man, and see the harshness of\r\nhis character, his unlimited pride, his contempt of all human rights,\r\nhis wild and passionate nature, and his greed of power. That he was the\r\nfounder of autocracy, as modern writers assert, is not altogether his\r\nown exclusive merit, although it cannot be denied that he contributed\r\nmuch towards it by his shrewdness and wise moderation. When in the\r\nearly days of his youth he seized the reins of government, he found\r\nmuch that had been prepared towards the future greatness of Russia; but\r\nRussia was still in a chaotic condition, and its forces were scattered\r\nand sunk as it were in a lethargy; they required an awakening and\r\nregulating hand, and this was principally Ivan’s work. Owing to the\r\nunfortunate system of appanages, which had been the ruin of Russia for\r\nmany centuries, by destroying all unity in course of time, sowing the\r\nseeds of discord, and making the Russian state an easy prey to its\r\nenemies, the idea of a common fatherland had quite disappeared; and the\r\ninternal dissensions among the princes, as well as the despotic pressure\r\nof the foreign barbarians, had so deranged and disjointed it, that the\r\npraiseworthy attempts of individual grand princes could meet with no\r\nbrilliant success, and it seemed as if Russia were fated to play a deeply\r\nsubordinate part in the hierarchy of states.\r\n\r\nNevertheless those attempts were not quite lost, and the prudent might\r\nsurmise that the time would yet come when they would bear fruit, once\r\nthe hydra of discord had been conquered and the scattered forces had\r\nbeen reunited. Ivan’s proceedings in this respect were certainly of\r\na macchiavellian nature. We have seen that for twenty-three years he\r\npatiently acknowledged the rights of other Russian princes and even\r\ntheir independence, and that by keeping his conquests to himself and not\r\nsharing them with his brothers and the other princes, and by taking his\r\nbrother’s inheritance and giving none to his other brothers, he first\r\nbegan to consider himself as autocrat and ruler of all Russia, and thus\r\ngradually prepared the princes for a recognition of his undivided sway\r\nand their own impotency and subordination.\r\n\r\nWe do not inquire as to whether the means he used for the attainment of\r\nhis end deserve our approval; we will only remark that great conquerors\r\nand founders of new empires, or such as reorganise and rejuvenate old and\r\ndecaying states, cannot be judged with the same standard by which wise\r\nregents are judged in regulated states. The resort to violent measures is\r\noften their highest duty, if they are to persist in their work and arrive\r\nat the aim they have imposed on themselves. From a political point of\r\nview, Ivan’s harsh proceedings therefore deserve some exculpation, all\r\nthe more so when we consider that he lived at a time when revolutions of\r\nevery kind were taking place in the states and their institutions, in the\r\nmodes of thinking and in the religion of men, in the arts and sciences,\r\nthe new forms often seeking to supplant the old in a violent manner; and\r\nwhen this change also began in Russia, where intellectual enlightenment\r\nwas so rare, we should not be surprised to see the forces of brutality\r\noften gaining the upper hand over the forces of reason.\r\n\r\nWe now find ourselves at one of the most important turning points of\r\nRussian political history, when by a regulated system of succession\r\nand by the incorporation of the independent principalities with the\r\ngrand principality, the Russian monarchy began to establish itself\r\nfirmly and to extend its bounds; when the hitherto terrible defiance\r\nof over-powerful nobles and of princes who claimed equal rank with the\r\ngrand prince submits to the restraints of a common obedience; when no\r\nmore dangers threaten Russia from the side of Novgorod and the Tatars;\r\nwhen a regulated system of taxation, a treasury and an organised army\r\nprotect the throne; and finally when science and art, the administration\r\nof justice, personal safety on the roads and in the towns, besides\r\nother blessings of peace and order, also begin to attract attention,\r\nprotection, and cultivation in Russia.[d]\r\n\r\n\r\nACCESSION OF VASILI IVANOVITCH (1505 A.D.)\r\n\r\nVasili Ivanovitch succeeded his father, and continued his policy both in\r\nforeign and domestic affairs. He endeavoured to extend the frontiers of\r\nthe Russian monarchy on the Lithuanian side, destroyed the independence\r\nof the last appanaged princes and the last republican township, Pskov,\r\nand strove to keep Kazan in subjection.\r\n\r\nIn his personal character Vasili resembled his father in his sterner\r\naspect. He let his nephew, the unfortunate Dmitri, die “destitute”\r\nin prison; over his brothers he maintained a strict surveillance,\r\nnot allowing his brother Andrew to marry until 1533, when he himself\r\nhad already two children; with his boyars he was also stern, though\r\nthere were but few executions and punishments during his reign. He\r\npreferred, in case of any suspected intention of departure on the part\r\nof a boyar, to take a written guarantee in which the security promised,\r\nin the event of departure, to pay a sum of money for those for whom\r\nhe went bail. Vasili even forgave his brother Simon, who had the\r\nintention of going over to Lithuania, and only changed his counsellors.\r\nStern on the occasion of his divorce from his first wife, Vasili was\r\ntender towards his second wife, and was very fond of his children. In\r\ngeneral the characteristics of Vasili are most faithfully summed up by\r\nKaramzin in the following sentence: “He followed the path indicated by\r\nthe wisdom of his father, without fear, without impulses of passion,\r\nmoving forward with measured and prudent steps, and drew near to his\r\naim, the aggrandisement of Russia, without leaving to his successor\r\neither the duty or the glory of repairing his faults.” In the eyes of\r\nthe historian this, of course, redeems the personally rather stern\r\nsides of his character, which were, however, quite comprehensible to\r\ncontemporaries.[31]\r\n\r\n\r\nWARS WITH LITHUANIA\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [1506 A.D.]]\r\n\r\nFrom the very commencement of his reign Vasili found himself confronted\r\nwith two questions: that of Kazan--for Muhammed Amin had risen even\r\nduring the reign of Ivan and had to be subdued--and that of Lithuania.\r\nFrom the ambassadors whom Alexander had sent to Ivan he learned that a\r\nnew sovereign was now reigning in Moscow. Having given information of\r\nthis in Livonia, so that in any case the grand master might be prepared,\r\nAlexander despatched an embassy to Moscow demanding the cession of the\r\ntowns that had been conquered by Ivan. The ambassadors received a firm\r\nreply from the new sovereign to the effect that he only reigned over his\r\nlegitimate possessions, which he intended to retain.\r\n\r\nAlexander saw the necessity of delay before taking a decisive line of\r\naction, of which course he informed the grand master. Meanwhile the\r\nambassadors who had come from Moscow to announce Vasili’s accession to\r\nthe throne required that Alexander should not constrain his wife to\r\nchange her religion. But Alexander died in 1506, and when Vasili heard of\r\nhis death he wrote to his sister that she should endeavour to persuade\r\nthe Polish lords and landed gentry to serve the Russian sovereign,\r\npromising at the same time to protect the Catholic faith. In answer to\r\nthis first attempt on the part of Moscow to unite with Lithuania, Helen\r\nreplied that Sigismund, the son of Casimir, was being chosen to the\r\nthrone of Lithuania. Sigismund also sent ambassadors with the demand to\r\nreturn the conquered towns, and received the same reply demanding that\r\nHelen should not be constrained to adopt the Catholic faith. At this time\r\nSigismund found an unexpected ally in the Crimean khan Mengli Girai,\r\nwho having met with support in Lithuania before the death of Alexander\r\nand being dissatisfied with the Muscovite sovereign because of his\r\nexpedition against Kazan, sent an embassy to Lithuania with proposals for\r\nan alliance. Sigismund promised him tribute, and Mengli Girai gave him\r\na _yarlik_ for the Russian territories of Novgorod, Pskov, and Riazan.\r\nSigismund informed the grand master of Livonia of the relations with the\r\nCrimea and with Kazan and called upon him to go to war, and measures\r\nfor the commencement of war were taken in the diet; but this time his\r\nallies were of but little assistance to Sigismund; Kazan submitted, while\r\nthe Crimea and Livonia did not move. On the other hand, Vasili found\r\nan important ally in Lithuania itself in the person of Prince Michael\r\nVasilievitch Glinski.\r\n\r\nPrince Michael Glinski, the descendant of a Tatar prince that had left\r\nthe horde during the reign of Vitovt and been baptised, had enjoyed great\r\ndistinction and influence under Alexander. Glinski was a skilful general\r\nand a highly educated man for those times; he had spent twelve years\r\nabroad and had learned the art of war in the armies of Albrecht of Saxony\r\nduring the war in Friesland and of the emperor Maximilian in Italy; he\r\nalso visited Spain. In these expeditions and in his continual intercourse\r\nwith western kings and princes, Glinski had adopted all the German\r\ncustoms and had become penetrated with the civilisation of the west.\r\nWhen he returned to Lithuania, Glinski gained the favour and confidence\r\nof King Alexander, who raised him to the dignity of court marshal and so\r\nincreased his possessions that, according to the hyperbolical expression\r\nof a Polish historian, he owned almost half of the entire Lithuanian\r\nprincipality and stood at the head of the numerous Russian party amongst\r\nthe Lithuanian lords. It was for this reason that at the death of\r\nAlexander the Lithuanian party hastened to choose Sigismund, for they\r\nfeared that Glinski might obtain the throne of the grand principality and\r\ntransfer the centre from Lithuania to Russia.\r\n\r\nWhen Sigismund came to the throne he showed an offensive coldness to\r\nGlinski, and paying no attention to his complaints against the lords who\r\nwere at enmity with him, at the head of whom was Zaberezhsky, he left\r\nfor Poland. Glinski thereupon decided to obtain satisfaction on his own\r\naccount; he made an incursion on the estates of Zaberezhsky, killed\r\nhim, and raised a revolt against the king. To this end he entered into\r\nrelations with Mengli Girai, and Vasili Ivanovitch, on his side, sent one\r\nof his secretaries to propose to him to become the subject of Russia, and\r\npromising to leave him the lands which he might occupy. Glinski however\r\nstill wavered and tried to effect a reconciliation with the king; finally\r\nlosing all hope of this, he joined the grand prince’s voyevods, who had\r\nmarched up to the frontiers of Lithuania. To Glinski and the foreign\r\nprinces in the Russian service was confided the task of devastating\r\nLithuania, but the voyevods did not move to their help, for in Moscow it\r\nwas counted advantageous to let others do its work. Meanwhile Sigismund\r\nsent an embassy, complaining of Glinski’s reception by Vasili and of the\r\nopening of hostilities. The letter was written in the name of Helen,\r\nand in his reply to her the grand prince directed her attention to the\r\nconstraint put upon the orthodox in Lithuania and enjoined her to remain\r\nfirm in her faith. Sigismund received no aid from Mengli Girai, but\r\nnevertheless he began warlike operations, which however were limited to\r\ninsignificant skirmishes. Finally a treaty was concluded by which all\r\nIvan’s acquisitions remained to Russia, and all that had been taken by\r\nGlinski was given back (1508). Glinski came to Moscow, where Medin and\r\nMaloiaroslavetz were given to him but he remained dissatisfied.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [1508-1514 A.D.]]\r\n\r\nThe peace of 1508 could not however put an end to the inimical relations\r\nbetween the two principalities: Glinski could not remain quiet until\r\nhe was avenged on his enemies, and Lithuania could not be quiet so\r\nlong as Glinski lived; while on his side Vasili Ivanovitch demanded\r\nbetter treatment for his sister Helen. Thus the relations between the\r\ntwo neighbouring states were strained. In 1509 Sigismund demanded\r\nthe surrender or execution of Glinski, accusing him of the death of\r\nAlexander; in the same year he announced his connection with the\r\nDanish king; it can also be easily understood that each reciprocal\r\nembassy complained of frontier quarrels, as is always the case in such\r\ncircumstances. In 1512 Vasili informed Sigismund that it had come to his\r\nears that the voyevods of Vilna and Trotski had seized Helen and held her\r\ncaptive--which does not appear at all improbable when the unruliness of\r\nthe Lithuanian lords is borne in mind--Sigismund denied the fact. That\r\nHelen officially received various rights, for instance that of a tribute\r\nor tax from the town of Bielsk, also does not prove that her position\r\nwas a very advantageous one, for this was worth nothing more than other\r\nofficial favours. In 1513 Helen died and the metropolitan of Kiev was\r\nsent for to officiate at her funeral; thus this victim of political\r\ncalculations left the scene. Helen herself, as far as can be judged\r\nfrom her correspondence with her father and brother, was possessed of\r\nconsiderable tact and energy.\r\n\r\nAt last a reason for beginning war presented itself; it became known at\r\nMoscow that the incursions made by the Crimeans on the Russian frontier\r\nterritories in 1512 were the result of a secret treaty that had been\r\nconcluded between Sigismund and Mengli Girai, by which the king had\r\npromised to pay the khan a yearly sum of 15,000 ducats to attack his\r\nenemies. Having sent Sigismund a declaration of war, Vasili began his\r\nwarlike preparations. The time was well chosen. In 1511 Albrecht of\r\nBrandenburg had been chosen as Prussian grand master, and although he\r\nwas a nephew of the Polish king he refused to acknowledge himself as his\r\nvassal, which he was obliged to do by the Treaty of Thorn; the emperor\r\nand the estates of the empire declared themselves for the grand master.\r\nAdvised by Glinski, Vasili had entered into relations with the emperor as\r\nearly as 1508, but the treaty between them was only concluded in 1514.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [1514-1518 A.D.]]\r\n\r\nWithout waiting for the termination of these negotiations, the grand\r\nprince assembled an army and in December, 1512, took the field. He\r\nmarched against Smolensk and having besieged it unsuccessfully, returned\r\nin March, 1513. His second expedition, from June until November of the\r\nsame year, was also unsuccessful, but in the third (June, 1514), Smolensk\r\nwas at last captured. Vasili made a triumphal entry into the town,\r\nbeing received with an address of welcome by the bishop of Smolensk.\r\nHe confirmed the rights that had been given to its inhabitants by the\r\nLithuanian government; those in the Lithuanian service who did not desire\r\nto remain under him he sent back to Lithuania, and he appointed Prince V.\r\nV. Shuiski, governor of Smolensk. After the submission of Smolensk the\r\nprince of Mstislavl also submitted to the grand prince. Sigismund himself\r\nhastened to the deliverance of Smolensk. Glinski, probably dissatisfied\r\nbecause Smolensk had not been given to him, entered into secret\r\nintercourse with him. Learning of this treachery Vasili ordered Glinski\r\nto be brought in fetters to Moscow and sent a voyevod against the king;\r\nthe king himself remained at Borissov and sent Constantine Ostrozhski to\r\nmeet the Moscow troops.\r\n\r\nThe Russian voyevods, Tcheliadin and Prince Michael Golitza met\r\nOstrozhski at Orsha on the Dnieper and sustained a terrible defeat. The\r\nfidelity of the boyars of Smolensk and of the bishop himself wavered and\r\nthey entered into communication with Sigismund; but the burghers informed\r\nShuiski of this treachery, and it was only the terribly energetic\r\nmeasures taken by him that preserved Smolensk for Russia: he ordered all\r\nthe traitors except the bishop to be hanged on the walls of the city, the\r\npresents that had been given them by the sovereign to be suspended round\r\nthe neck of each one. The assault on Smolensk was unsuccessful, and the\r\nwar was afterward carried on feebly, which is explained by the exhaustion\r\nof Moscow after the battle of Orsha and the probable reluctance of the\r\nLithuanian nobility to take an active part in it. After this Sigismund\r\ninstigated the Tatars against Russia, in particular those of the Crimea,\r\nwhere in 1515 Mengli Girai had been succeeded by Muhammed Girai, who,\r\nnotwithstanding his relations with Moscow, made in 1517 an attack on Tula\r\nand was repulsed. On his side Vasili strengthened his relations with\r\nAlbrecht who kept his vassal, the grand master of Livonia, in check.\r\nHowever while Albrecht hesitated and demanded money, Vasili required that\r\nhe should begin to act. The emperor, instead of beginning the war, as had\r\nbeen at first supposed he would do, offered his mediation, and it was\r\nwith this aim in view that in 1517 the famous baron Sigismund Herberstein\r\ncame to Moscow. Polish ambassadors also came; but with the news of their\r\ncoming, Moscow also learned of the attack on Opochka by the Lithuanian\r\ntroops and their repulse, and when Vasili heard of its failure he allowed\r\nthe ambassadors access to him. The negotiations however came to nothing.\r\nThe Moscow sovereign demanded Kiev and other towns, and the Lithuanian\r\nking refused to give up Smolensk. The death of Maximilian (1519) put\r\nan end to the imperial mediation; anyhow the emperor had not wished to\r\ngive any real assistance: “It is not well”--he wrote to the grand master\r\nAlbrecht--“to drive out the king, and make the czar of all Russia great.”\r\n\r\nIn 1518 Albrecht again asked for money; the grand prince agreed, and at\r\nthe former’s request sent a notification of his alliance with him to\r\nthe French king, Francis I--the first instance of intercourse between\r\nRussia and France. In answer to a fresh embassy from Albrecht bringing\r\ninformation of an invitation from the pope to join an alliance against\r\nthe Turks, which Albrecht would not enter into without the grand prince’s\r\nconsent, an ambassador was sent to Koenigsberg from Moscow, who was\r\nreceived with the highest honours by the grand master. But Albrecht’s\r\nhelp was not very efficacious; he was soon obliged to conclude a treaty\r\nwith King Sigismund by which he acknowledged himself his vassal, in\r\nreturn for which he obtained Prussia as an hereditary possession, laid\r\naside his title of grand master, and assumed a new title with his new\r\nfaith, that of duke of Prussia.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [1521-1523 A.D.]]\r\n\r\nThe war at that time was limited to incursions, and Vasili Ivanovitch\r\nhad even decided to seek peace; but the envoys that came would not\r\nmake any concessions, only letting negotiations drag on in the hope\r\nof some event coming to their assistance; in this manner the war was\r\nprolonged until the Lent of 1521, when negotiations were to be again\r\nrenewed; however they were not opened: in Kazan reigned Sahib Girai, the\r\nbrother of Muhammed Girai, and they both threatened Moscow, indeed the\r\nformer advanced as far as Moscow itself (1521). The devastations of the\r\nTatars weakened Russia for a time and the negotiations with Lithuania\r\nwere renewed; although a lasting peace was not concluded, a truce was\r\ncontinued for five years without the exchange of prisoners, and by this\r\ntruce Smolensk remained to Russia. In 1526, through the medium of the\r\nemperor’s envoys, negotiations for a definitive peace were again opened,\r\nbut Smolensk was an obstacle, neither side consenting to give up the town\r\nwhich was regarded as the key to Kiev. Smolensk was treated in the same\r\nmanner as the other territories annexed; the inhabitants were transferred\r\nto Moscow as had been done with the inhabitants of Pskov and Novgorod,\r\nand it was for this reason that Smolensk stood by Moscow in 1612.\r\n\r\n\r\nWARS WITH THE TATARS\r\n\r\nBesides the relations with Lithuania, the relations with the Tatars\r\nconstituted the chief problem of the reign of Vasili Ivanovitch. At\r\nhis accession his first enterprise was to send against Kazan an army,\r\namongst the leaders of which was his brother Dmitri; the siege of Kazan\r\n(1506) was unsuccessful, nevertheless in 1507 Muhammed Amin sent a\r\nletter to the grand prince with proposals of peace. Intercourse with\r\nthe Crimea originally bore the same character as in the time of Ivan;\r\na difference was however soon observable; the Crimea had no longer\r\nanything to fear from the remnants of the Golden Horde, and the Crimeans\r\nwere therefore ready to make friends with whatever state would give\r\nthem most. “Intercourse between the Crimea and the states of Moscow and\r\nLithuania”--justly remarks Soloviov--“assumed the character of a bribery\r\nof robbers.”\r\n\r\nSuch being the condition of affairs, it is not surprising that in spite\r\nof the confirmation of the treaty concluded between Ivan and Mengli\r\nGirai, the Tatars should have begun their attacks. In 1507 they were\r\ndefeated at the Oka, and in consequence of this, envoys were sent\r\ndemanding presents, the liberation of Abdul Letiv, former czar of Kazan\r\nand stepson of Mengli Girai, and asking for assistance against Astrakhan.\r\nVasili Ivanovitch liberated Abdul Letiv, gave him the town of Iuriev, and\r\nby an oath of alliance obliged him to promise faithfully to serve the\r\nczar, not to have relations with his enemies, not to permit his servants\r\nto plunder on the roads or insult the churches, to live at peace with\r\nthe other princes, not to wage war against Kazan without permission,\r\nand not to leave the confines of the state of Moscow. In 1515 Mengli\r\nGirai died, and his son Muhammed Girai, who succeeded him, demanded\r\nfrom Vasili Ivanovitch not only the cession to the Polish king of\r\nSmolensk, at the acquisition of which without his knowledge he was much\r\nincensed, but also of those towns which had been taken by Ivan. After\r\nlong delays and much trouble, many insults and, of course, presents, an\r\noath of alliance was obtained of Muhammed Girai in 1519, but meanwhile\r\nthe attacks of the Crimeans continued. The son of Muhammed Girai, the\r\nczarevitch Bogatir, laid waste the borderland of Riazan; and in 1517 the\r\nTatars--notwithstanding the Russian offer of Koshira, bordering on the\r\nsteppes, to Ahmed Girai, brother of the khan--penetrated as far as Tula,\r\nwhere they were repulsed.\r\n\r\nThe grand prince then proposed to the council (_douma_) the question\r\nwhether relations with the Crimea should be maintained, and it was\r\ndecided that they must be maintained in order to prevent the rupture from\r\nbecoming an open one. Meanwhile in 1518 Muhammed Amin of Kazan died,\r\nand Abdul Letiv, who had previously been czar, died a month after him;\r\nat the request of the inhabitants of Kazan a czar was named from Moscow\r\nin 1519--Shig Alei, a prince of Astrakhan, and descendant of the czars\r\nof the Golden Horde. The Crimean khan was greatly dissatisfied at this\r\nchoice of one whose family was at an eternal enmity with his own. Shig\r\nAlei remained in Kazan until 1521 when the inhabitants, dissatisfied with\r\nhim, formed a conspiracy and invited Sahib Girai, brother of Muhammed\r\nGirai, to come and rule over them. Having established his brother on\r\nthe throne of Kazan, Muhammed Girai advanced towards Moscow. The grand\r\nprince, warned too late by his well-wishers at Azov, could not take\r\nthe necessary measures, and left Moscow, confiding the defence of the\r\ncity to the boyars and baptised Tatar prince, Peter; they entered into\r\nnegotiations with the enemy and paid him a ransom. The heroic defence of\r\nPereiaslavl in Riazan by Khabar Simski somewhat softened the mournful\r\nimpression of this calamity, which was augmented by the fact that Sahib\r\nGirai had at the same time devastated the territories of Nijni-Novgorod\r\nand Vladimir. The khan was preparing to repeat his expedition, and the\r\ngrand prince himself took the field in expectation of his coming, but he\r\nnever came.\r\n\r\nAnother undertaking then occupied Muhammed Girai: in 1523 he joined the\r\nNogaians and conquered Astrakhan. There the Nogaians quarreled with him\r\nand killed him; his place was taken by Saidat Girai, who sent the grand\r\nprince the following conditions for an alliance: To give him 60,000\r\naltines (an ancient coin of the value of three kopecks) and to make peace\r\nwith Sahib Girai; but Vasili seeing the devastation of the Crimea both by\r\nthe Nogaians and the Cossacks of Dashkevitch, who had hitherto acted in\r\nconcert with the Crimeans, rejected these proposals. To avenge himself on\r\nSahib Girai, who had massacred the Russians in Kazan where blood flowed\r\nlike water, Vasili himself came to the land of Kazan (1523), devastated\r\nit, and made the inhabitants prisoners; on his return he built the town\r\nof Vasilsursk. When in 1524 a great army was sent from Moscow to Kazan,\r\nSahib Girai fled to the Crimea, and the inhabitants of Kazan proclaimed\r\nhis young nephew Sava Girai as czar; the expedition from Moscow was\r\nhowever unsuccessful, although the people of Kazan, who had lost their\r\nartillery engineer, sued for peace.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE GROWING POWER OF RUSSIA\r\n\r\nTheir dependence upon the grand prince was irksome to the inhabitants of\r\nKazan; fresh disputes arose, Vasili brought on an intrigue, and Kazan\r\nsoon asked for a new czar. Vasili named Shig Alei, who was at that time\r\nin Nijni, but when the people of Kazan entreated that his brother Jan\r\nAlei (Enalei), who then ruled over Kassimov, should be nominated in his\r\nstead, Vasili consented. Jan Alei was established at Kazan and Shig\r\nAlei was given Koshira, but as he did not keep the peace, and entered\r\non negotiations with Kazan, he was exiled to Belozero. Disturbances\r\ntook place in the Crimea; Saidat Girai was overthrown by Sahib, but the\r\nrelations between the Crimea and Moscow remained the same; the Tatars\r\ncontinued to make insignificant raids and obtained presents. Nevertheless\r\nthe Tatar messengers began to be less respectfully treated at Moscow:\r\n“Our messengers”--wrote Sahib Girai--“complain that thou dost not honour\r\nthem as of old, and yet it is thy duty to honour them; whoever wishes\r\nto pay respect to the master, throws a bone to his dog.” Of other\r\ndiplomatic relations those with Sweden and Denmark bore the character\r\nof frontier disputes; the intercourse with the pope was entered upon\r\nthrough the desire of the latter to convert Russia to Catholicism and\r\nincite her to war against Turkey. The intercourse with the latter power\r\nhad no particular results. It is curious to observe that at this period\r\nrelations were entered into with India; the sultan Babur sent ambassadors\r\n(1533) with proposals of mutual commercial dealings.[b]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [1533 A.D.]]\r\n\r\nEach day added to the importance of Russia in Europe. Vasili exchanged\r\nambassadors with the eastern courts and wrote to Francis I the great\r\nking of the Gauls. He numbered among his correspondents Leo X, Clement\r\nVII, Maximilian, and Charles V; Gustavus Vasa, founder of a new dynasty;\r\nSultan Selim, conqueror of Egypt and Soliman the Magnificent. The grand\r\nmogul of the Indes, Babur, descendant of Timur, sought his friendship.\r\nThe autocracy affirmed itself each day more vigorously. Vasili governed\r\nwithout consulting his council of boyars. “_Moltchi, smerd!_” (Hold,\r\nclown!) said he to one of the nobles who dared to raise an objection.\r\nThis growing power manifested itself in the splendour of the court, the\r\nreceptions of the ambassadors displaying a luxury hitherto unprecedented.\r\nStrangers, though not in large numbers, continued to come to Moscow,\r\nof whom the most illustrious was a monk from Mount Athos, Maxine the\r\nGreek.[e]\r\n\r\n\r\nMAXINE THE GREEK\r\n\r\nIn the early days of his reign, when Vasili was examining the treasures\r\nleft to him by his father, he perceived a large number of Greek church\r\nbooks which had been partly collected by former grand princes and partly\r\nbrought to Moscow by Sophia, and which now lay covered with dust in utter\r\nneglect. The young sovereign manifested the desire of having a person\r\nwho would be capable of looking them over and of translating the best of\r\nthem into the Slavonic language. Such a person was not to be found in\r\nMoscow, and letters were written to Constantinople. The patriarch, being\r\ndesirous of pleasing the grand prince, made search for such a philosopher\r\nin Bulgaria, in Macedonia and in Thessalonica; but the Ottoman yoke\r\nhad there crushed all the remains of ancient learning and darkness and\r\nignorance reigned in the sultan’s realms. Finally it was discovered that\r\nin the famous convent of the Annunciation on Mount Athos there were two\r\nmonks, Sabba and Maxine, who were learned theologians and well versed in\r\nthe Slavonic and Greek languages. The former on account of his great age\r\nwas unable to undertake so long a journey, but the latter consented to\r\nthe desire of the patriarch and of the grand prince.\r\n\r\nIt would indeed have been impossible to find a person better fitted for\r\nthe projected work. Born in Greece, but educated in the enlightened\r\nwest, Maxine had studied in Paris and Florence, had travelled much,\r\nwas acquainted with various languages, and was possessed of unusual\r\nerudition, which he had acquired in the best universities and in\r\nconversation with men of enlightenment. Vasili received him with marked\r\nfavour. When he saw the library, Maxine, in a transport of enthusiasm\r\nand astonishment, exclaimed: “Sire! all Greece does not now possess\r\nsuch treasures, neither does Italy, where Latin fanaticism has reduced\r\nto ashes many of the works of our theologians which my compatriots had\r\nsaved from the Mohammedan barbarians.” The grand prince listened to him\r\nwith the liveliest pleasure and confided the library to his care. The\r\nzealous Greek made a catalogue of the books which had been until then\r\nunknown to the Slavonic people. By desire of the sovereign, and with the\r\nassistance of three Muscovites, Vasili, Dmitri and Michael Medovartzov,\r\nhe translated the commentary of the psalter. Approved by the Metropolitan\r\nVarlaam and all the ecclesiastical council, this important work made\r\nMaxine famous, and so endeared him to the grand prince that he could\r\nnot part with him, and daily conversed with him on matters of religion.\r\nThe wise Greek was not, however, dazzled by these honours, and though\r\ngrateful to Vasili, he earnestly implored him to allow him to return to\r\nthe quiet of his retreat at Mount Athos: “There,” said he, “will I praise\r\nyour name and tell my compatriots that in the world there still exists a\r\nChristian czar, mighty and great, who, if it pleases the Most High, may\r\nyet deliver us from the tyranny of the infidel.” But Vasili only replied\r\nby fresh signs of favour and kept him nine years in Moscow; this time was\r\nspent by Maxine in the translation of various works, in correcting errors\r\nin the ancient translations, and in composing works of piety of which\r\nmore than a hundred are known to us.\r\n\r\nHaving free access to the grand prince, he sometimes interceded for the\r\nnoblemen who had fallen in disgrace and regained for them the sovereign’s\r\nfavour. This excited the dissatisfaction and envy of many persons, in\r\nparticular of the clergy and of the worldly-minded monks of St. Joseph,\r\nwho enjoyed the favour of Vasili. The humble-minded metropolitan Varlaam\r\nhad cared little for earthly matters, but his successor, the proud\r\nDaniel, soon declared himself the enemy of the foreigner. It began to be\r\nasked: “Who is this man who dares to deface our sacred church books and\r\nrestore to favour the disgraced boyars?” Some tried to prove that he was\r\na heretic, others represented him to the grand prince as an ungrateful\r\ncalumniator who censured the acts of the sovereign behind his back. It\r\nwas at this time that Vasili was divorced from the unfortunate Solomonia,\r\nand it is said that this pious ecclesiastic did really disapprove of\r\nit; however we find amongst his works a discourse against those who\r\nrepudiate their wives without lawful cause. Always disposed to take\r\nthe part of the oppressed, he secretly received them in his cell and\r\nsometimes heard injurious speeches directed against the sovereign and the\r\nmetropolitan. Thus the unfortunate boyar Ivan Beklemishef complained to\r\nhim of the irascibility of Vasili, and said that formerly the venerable\r\npastors of the church had restrained the sovereigns from indulging their\r\npassions and committing injustice, whereas now Moscow no longer had a\r\nmetropolitan, for Daniel only bore the name and the mask of a pastor,\r\nwithout thinking that he ought to be the guide of consciences and the\r\nprotector of the innocent; he also said that Maxine would never be\r\nallowed to leave Russia, because the grand prince and the metropolitan\r\nfeared his indiscretions in other countries, where he might publish\r\nthe tale of their faults and weaknesses. At last Maxine’s enemies so\r\nirritated the grand prince against him, that he ordered him to be brought\r\nto judgment and Maxine was condemned to be confined in one of the\r\nmonasteries of Iver, having been found guilty of falsely interpreting the\r\nHoly Scriptures and the dogmas of the church. According to the opinion\r\nof some contemporaries the charge was a calumny invented by Jonas,\r\narchimandrite of the Tchudov monastery, Vassian, bishop of Kolomna, and\r\nthe metropolitan.[f]\r\n\r\n\r\nPRIVATE LIFE OF VASILI IVANOVITCH; HIS DEATH\r\n\r\nThere is one event in the private life of Vasili Ivanovitch which has\r\ngreat importance on the subsequent course of history, and throws a\r\nclearer light on the relations of men and parties at this epoch. This\r\nevent is his divorce and second marriage. Vasili Ivanovitch had first\r\ncontracted a marriage in the year of his father’s death with Solomonia\r\nSabourov; but they had no children and Solomonia vainly resorted to\r\nsorcery in order to have children and keep the love of her husband. The\r\ngrand prince no longer loved her and decided to divorce her. He consulted\r\nhis boyars, laying stress on the fact that he had no heir and that his\r\nbrothers did not understand how to govern their own appanages; it is said\r\nthat the boyars replied “The unfruitful fig-tree is cut down and cast out\r\nof the vineyard.” The sovereign then turned with the same question to the\r\nspiritual powers: the metropolitan Daniel gave his entire consent, but\r\nthe monk Vassian, known in the world as Prince Vasili Patrikëiev, who,\r\ntogether with his father, had been forced to become a monk during the\r\nreign of Ivan because he belonged to the party of Helen, but who was now\r\ngreatly esteemed by Vasili, was against the divorce and was therefore\r\nbanished from the monastery of Simon to that of Joseph. Maxine the Greek\r\nand Prince Simon Kurbski were also against the divorce, and suffered\r\nfor their opinion; and the boyar Beklemishev, who was on friendly terms\r\nwith Maxine, was executed. Solomonia was made to take the veil at the\r\nconvent of Suzdal and Vasili married Helen Vasilievna Glinski, the\r\nniece of Michael Glinski who had been liberated from prison (1526).\r\nFrom this marriage Vasili had two sons; Ivan (born 1530) and Iuri (born\r\n1533). Vasili’s love for his second wife was so great that according to\r\nHerberstein he had his beard cut off to please her. Towards the end of\r\n1533 Vasili fell ill and died on December 3rd, leaving as his heir his\r\ninfant son Ivan.[b]\r\n\r\n\r\nA FORECAST OF THE REIGN OF IVAN (IV) THE TERRIBLE\r\n\r\nThe rôle and the character of Ivan IV have been and still are very\r\ndifferently appreciated by Russian historians. Karamzin, who has never\r\nsubmitted his accounts and his documents to a sufficiently severe\r\ncritic, sees in him a prince who, naturally vicious and cruel, gave,\r\nunder restriction to two virtuous ministers, a few years of tranquillity\r\nto Russia; and who subsequently, abandoning himself to the fury of his\r\npassions, appalled Europe as well as the empire with what the historian\r\ndesignates “seven epochs of massacres.” Kostomarov re-echoes the opinions\r\nof Karamzin.\r\n\r\nAnother school, represented by Soloviev and Zabielin, has manifested a\r\ngreater defiance towards the prejudiced statements of Kurbski, chief\r\nof the oligarchical party; towards Guagnini, a courtier of the king of\r\nPoland; towards Tanbe and Kruse, traitors to the sovereign who had taken\r\nthem into his service. Above all, they have taken into account the times\r\nand the society in whose midst Ivan the Terrible lived. They concern\r\nthemselves less with his morals as an individual than with his rôle as\r\ninstrument of the historical development of Russia. Did not the French\r\nhistorians during long years misinterpret the enormous services rendered\r\nby Louis XI in the great work of the unification of France and of the\r\ncreation of the modern state? His justification was at length achieved\r\nafter a more minute examination into documents and circumstances.\r\n\r\nAt the time when Ivan succeeded his father the struggle of the central\r\npower against the forces of the past had changed character. The old\r\nRussian states, which had held so long in check the new power of Moscow;\r\nthe principalities of Tver, Riazan, Suzdal, Novgorod-Seversk; the\r\nrepublics of Novgorod, Pskov, Viatka had lost their independence. Their\r\npossessions had served to aggrandise those of Moscow. All northern and\r\neastern Russia was thus united under the sceptre of the grand prince. To\r\nthe ceaseless struggles constantly breaking out against Tver, Riazan,\r\nNovgorod, was to succeed the great foreign strife--the holy war against\r\nLithuania, the Tatars, the Swedes.\r\n\r\nPrecisely because the work of the unification of Great Russia was\r\naccomplished, the resistance in the interior against the prince’s\r\nauthority was to become more active. The descendants of reigning families\r\ndispossessed by force of bribery or arms, the servitors of those old\r\nroyal houses, had entered the service of the masters of Moscow. His\r\ncourt was composed of crownless princes--the Chouiski, the Kurbski, the\r\nVorotinski; descendants of ancient appanaged princes, proud of the blood\r\nof Rurik which coursed through their veins. Others were descended from\r\nthe Lithuanian Gedimine, or from the baptised Tatar _Monzas_.\r\n\r\nAll these princes, as well as the powerful boyars of Tver, Riazan,\r\nNovgorod, were become the boyars of the grand prince. There was for all\r\nonly one court at which they could serve--that of Moscow. When Russia had\r\nbeen divided into sovereign states, the discontented boyars had been at\r\nliberty to change masters--to pass from the service of Tchernigov into\r\nthat of Kiev, from that of Suzdal into that of Novgorod. Now, whither\r\ncould they go? Outside of Moscow, there were only foreign rulers, enemies\r\nof Russia. To make use of the ancient right to change masters was to\r\ngo over to the enemy--it was treason. “To change” and “to betray” were\r\nbecome synonymous: the Russian word _izmiyanit_ (third person singular of\r\n“to change”) was become the word _izmiyanik_ (“traitor”).\r\n\r\nThe Russian boyar could take refuge neither with the Germans, the Swedes,\r\nnor the Tatars; he could go only to the sovereign of Lithuania--but this\r\nwas the worst possible species of change, the most pernicious form of\r\ntreason. The prince of Moscow knew well that the war with Lithuania--that\r\nstate which Polish in the west, by its Russian provinces, in the east\r\nexercised a dangerous attraction over subjects of Moscow--was a struggle\r\nfor existence. Lithuania was not only a foreign enemy--it was a domestic\r\nenemy, with intercourse and sympathies in the very heart of the Russian\r\nstate, even in the palace of the czar; her formidable hand was felt in\r\nall intrigues, in all conspiracies. The foreign war against Lithuania,\r\nthe domestic war against the Russian oligarchy are but two different\r\nphases of the same war--the heaviest and most perilous of all those\r\nundertaken by the grand prince of Moscow. The dispossessed princes, the\r\nboyars of the old independent states had given up the struggle against\r\nhim on the field of battle; they continued to struggle against him in his\r\nown court.\r\n\r\nIt was no longer war between state and state; it was intestine\r\nstrife--that of the oligarchy against autocratic power. Resigned to the\r\nloss of their sovereignty, the new prince-boyars of Moscow were not\r\nyet resigned to their position as mere subjects. The struggle was thus\r\nlimited to a narrower field, and was therefore the more desperate. The\r\ncourt at Moscow was a tilt-yard, whence none could emerge without a\r\nchange of masters--the Lithuanian for the Muscovite--without treason:\r\nhence the furious nature of the war of two principles under Ivan IV.[e]\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE MINORITY OF IVAN IV\r\n\r\nOn the death of his father, Ivan was only three years of age. Helena,\r\nhis mother, a woman unfit for the toils of government, impure in her\r\nconduct, and without judgment, assumed the office of regent, which she\r\nshared with a paramour, whose elevation to such a height caused universal\r\ndisgust, particularly among the princes of the blood and the nobility.\r\nThe measures which had of late years been adopted towards the boyars were\r\nnot forgotten by that haughty class; and now that the infirm state of the\r\nthrone gave them a fair pretext for complaint, they conspired against the\r\nregent, partly with a view to remove so unpopular and degraded a person\r\nfrom the imperial seat, but principally that they might take advantage\r\nof the minority of the czar, and seize upon the empire for their own\r\nends. The circumstances in which the death of Vasili left the country\r\nwere favourable to these designs. The licentiousness that prevailed at\r\ncourt, the absence of a strict and responsible head, and the confusion\r\nthat generally took the place of the order that had previously prevailed,\r\nassisted the treacherous nobles in their treasonable projects. They had\r\nlong panted for revenge and restitution, and the time seemed to be ripe\r\nfor the execution of their plans.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: IVAN THE TERRIBLE\r\n\r\n(1530-1584)]\r\n\r\nAmongst the most prominent members of this patrician league, were the\r\nthree paternal uncles of the young prince. They made no scruple of\r\nexhibiting their feelings; and they at last grew so clamorous, that the\r\nregent, on the ground that they entertained designs upon the throne,\r\ncondemned them to loathsome dungeons, where they died in lingering\r\ntorments. Their followers and abettors suffered by torture and the worst\r\nkinds of ignominious punishment. These examples spread such consternation\r\namongst the rest of the conspirators, that they fled to Lithuania and\r\nthe Crimea, where they endeavoured to inspire a sympathy in their\r\nmisfortunes. But the regent, whose time appears to have been solely\r\ndedicated to the worst description of pleasures, being unable to preserve\r\nherself without despotism, succeeded in overcoming the enemies whom her\r\nown conduct was so mainly instrumental in creating.\r\n\r\nThe reign of lascivious folly and wanton rigour was not, however,\r\ndestined to survive the wrath of the nobles. For five years, intestine\r\njealousies and thickening plots plunged the country into anarchy; and, at\r\nlast, the regent died suddenly, having, it is believed, fallen by poison\r\nadministered through the agency of the revengeful boyars. The spectacle\r\nof one criminal executing summary justice upon another, is not destitute\r\nof some moral utility; and in this case it might have had its beneficial\r\ninfluence, were it not that the principal conspirators had no sooner\r\ntaken off the regent than they violently seized upon the guardianship of\r\nthe throne.\r\n\r\nThe foremost persons in this drama were the Shuiski--a family that had\r\nlong been treated with suspicion by the czars, their insolent bearing\r\nhaving always exposed them to distrust. Prince Shuiski was appointed\r\npresident of the council of the boyars, to whom the administration of\r\naffairs was confided, and although his malignant purposes were kept in\r\ncheck by the crowd of equally ambitious persons that surrounded him, he\r\npossessed sufficient opportunities to consummate a variety of wrongs\r\nupon the resources of the state and upon obnoxious individuals--thus\r\nrevenging himself indiscriminately for the ancient injuries his race had\r\nsuffered. During this iniquitous rule, which exhibited the extraordinary\r\nfeatures of a government composed of persons with different interests,\r\npressing forward to the same end, and making a common prey of the trust\r\nthat was reposed in their hands, Russia was despoiled in every quarter.\r\nThe Tatars, freed for a season from the watchful vigilance of the throne,\r\nroamed at large through the provinces, pillaging and slaying wherever\r\nthey went; and this enormous guilt was crowned by the rapacious exactions\r\nand sanguinary proscriptions of the council. The young Ivan was subjected\r\nto the most brutal insults: his education was designedly neglected; he\r\nwas kept in total ignorance of public affairs, that he might be rendered\r\nunqualified to assume the hereditary power; and Prince Shuiski, in the\r\nmidst of these base intrigues against the future czar, was often seen\r\nto treat him in a contemptuous and degrading manner, on one occasion he\r\nstretched forth his legs, and pressed the weight of his feet on the body\r\nof the boy. Perhaps these unexampled provocations, and the privations\r\nto which he was condemned, produced the germs of a character which was\r\nafterwards developed in such terrible magnificence, the fiend that lived\r\nin the heart of Ivan might not have been born with him; it was probably\r\ngenerated by the cruelties and wrongs that were practised on his youth.\r\n\r\nIn vain the Belski, moderate and wise, and the primate, influenced by\r\nthe purest motives, remonstrated against the ruinous proceedings of the\r\ncouncil. The voice of admonition was lost in the hideous orgies of the\r\nboyars, until a sudden invasion by the Tatars awakened them to a sense of\r\ntheir peril. They rallied, order was restored, and Russia was preserved.\r\nBut the danger was no sooner over than the Shuiski returned in all their\r\nformer strength, seized upon Moscow in the dead of the night, penetrated\r\nto the couch of Ivan, and, dragging him out of his sleep, endeavoured to\r\ndestroy his intellect by filling him with sudden terror. The primate,\r\nwhose mild representations had displeased them, was ill-treated and\r\ndeposed: and the prince Belski, who could not be prevailed upon to link\r\nhis fortunes with their desperate courses, was murdered in the height of\r\ntheir frenzy. Even those members of their own body who, touched by some\r\nintermittent pity, ventured to expostulate, were beaten in the chamber of\r\ntheir deliberations, and cast out from amongst them.\r\n\r\nUnder such unpropitious auspices as these, the young Ivan, the inheritor\r\nof a consolidated empire, grew up to manhood. His disposition, naturally\r\nfierce, headstrong, and vindictive, was most insidiously cultivated\r\ninto ferocity by the artful counsellors that surrounded him. His\r\nearliest amusements were the torture of wild animals, the ignoble feat\r\nof riding over old men and women, flinging stones from ambuscades\r\nupon the passers-by, and precipitating dogs and cats from the summit\r\nof his palace. Such entertainments as these, the sport of boyhood,\r\ngave unfortunately too correct a prognostic of the fatal career that\r\nlay before him. By a curious retribution, the first exercise of this\r\nterrible temper in its application to humanity fell upon the Shuiski,\r\nwho certainly, of all mankind, best merited its infliction. When Ivan\r\nwas in his thirteenth year, he accompanied a hunting party at which\r\nPrince Gluiski--another factious lord--and the president of the council\r\nwere present. Gluiski, himself a violent and remorseless man, envied\r\nthe ascendency of Shuiski, and prompted the young prince to address him\r\nin words of great heat and insult. Shuiski, astonished at the youth’s\r\nboldness, replied in anger. This was sufficient provocation. Ivan gave\r\nway to his rage, and, on a concerted signal, Shuiski was dragged out into\r\nthe public streets, and worried alive by dogs in the open daylight. The\r\nwretch expiated a life of guilt by the most horrible agonies.\r\n\r\nThus freed from one tyranny, Ivan was destined for another, which,\r\nhowever, accepted him as its nominal head, urging him onward to acts of\r\nblood which were but too congenial to his taste. The Gluiski having got\r\nrid of their formidable competitor in the race of crime, now assumed the\r\ndirection of affairs. Under their administration, the prince was led to\r\nthe commission of the most extravagant atrocities; and the doctrine was\r\ninculcated upon his mind, that the only way to assert authority was by\r\nmanifesting the extremity of its wrath. He was taught to believe that\r\npower consisted in oppression. They applauded each fresh instance of\r\nvengeance; and initiated him into a short method of relieving himself\r\nfrom every person who troubled or offended him, by sacrificing the victim\r\non the spot.\r\n\r\n\r\nIVAN ASSUMES THE REINS OF GOVERNMENT\r\n\r\nThis terrible system continued for three years. The pupilage of the\r\nprince was an uninterrupted scene of horror; and he was crowned czar of\r\nall the Russias in his eighteenth year, after a minority of blood. The\r\ncitizens, unsafe and trembling under a despotism which was so capricious\r\nin its enormities, were at length driven to desperation. They fired\r\nthe city in several places one night, and Ivan awoke the next morning\r\namidst flame and smoke, the tossing of brands, and the imprecations of\r\nthe multitude. He had been accustomed to terrors, but this conflagration\r\nsmote him to the heart. In the midst of the confusion, Sylvester, a monk\r\nbelonging to that roving order of persons who then wandered through the\r\ncountry affecting to be inspired with a divine mission, suddenly appeared\r\nin the presence of the affrighted despot. With a Gospel in one hand,\r\nwhile the other was raised in an attitude of prophecy, he pointed to the\r\nruins that surrounded him, and invoking the attention of the prince to\r\nthe consequences of his infatuation, he dwelt upon certain appearances\r\nfrom heaven which prognosticated evil to the dynasty if these courses\r\nwere not abandoned; and, working powerfully upon a mind already agonised\r\nwith fear, he finally succeeded in gaining a complete ascendency over\r\nthe czar. The effect was sudden and extraordinary. The virtuous Alexis\r\nAdaschev aided Sylvester in his efforts to reclaim Ivan; and these,\r\nassisted by the gentle persuasions of the beautiful Anastasia, Ivan’s\r\nyoung consort whom he had but recently married, appeared to produce a\r\nstrong impression upon his feelings.\r\n\r\nThe result was an entire change in the system of government. Able and\r\nupright men displaced the corrupt and audacious counsellors who had\r\nhitherto filled the empire with alarm; a new organisation of the army\r\ntook place; a just assessment of the fiefs, the various services, and\r\ncontingents, was established; proprietors of estates were obliged to\r\ncontribute to the maintenance of the military strength according to\r\ntheir means; and by a bonus in the pay of the soldiery, which was now\r\nadopted, the available force of the country was raised to the number of\r\nthree hundred thousand men. Thus strengthened, with prudent ministers\r\nand a powerful army, Ivan set himself to the worthy task of subduing\r\nthe rebellious Tatars. His ardour even appears to have carried him into\r\nextremes, for in the depth of winter he marched at the head of the\r\nsoldiery to the siege of Kazan, although his followers did not hesitate\r\nto declare that no good commander would think of conducting his troops in\r\nso rigorous a season into the quarters of the enemy. But such ebullitions\r\nof discontent were punished with so much severity, that the troops soon\r\nlearned to be content with the severities which procured such victories\r\nas Ivan was fortunate enough to gain. The first measure of great utility\r\nwhich he accomplished, was the erection of forts on the frontier to\r\nrepel the aggressions of the enemy; but apprehending that even these\r\nwere not sufficient to deter the marauders, he advanced upon Kazan,\r\nand captured it by springing a mine--a process in the art of war which\r\nwas quite novel to the Russians, and filled them with astonishment and\r\nadmiration. Having taken the city, he turned the mosques of the Tatars\r\ninto Christian temples, and caused the khan to be baptised; which proofs\r\nof his religious zeal were admirably calculated to ingratiate him in the\r\nregards of the people.\r\n\r\nIn one of those ecstatic moods which sometimes assail the better judgment\r\nof the old chroniclers, the Russian historian informs us that Ivan, upon\r\nentering Kazan, wept at the sight of the dead bodies with which the\r\nstreets were strewn. We certainly cannot put in any evidence in disproof\r\nof this apocryphal assertion, but the picture of Nero fiddling while Rome\r\nwas burning is even more probable.\r\n\r\nIn addition to his successes at Kazan, Ivan was triumphant in the kingdom\r\nof Astrakhan, which he afterwards annexed to the Russian empire. This\r\nacquisition was very valuable, as in that district the vine, and other\r\nrich productions of the soil, grew in remarkable luxuriance. Fortune\r\nseemed on all hands to favour the interval of grace that visited the\r\nczar. While he was pursuing his course of victory in other places, eighty\r\nthousand Turks, who had been despatched by Selim II against Astrakhan,\r\nperished in the desolate steppes by which it was surrounded. The wars\r\nwere thus terminated in glorious and important achievements, which laid\r\nthe foundations of that expanded commerce which afterwards rendered\r\nillustrious the era of one of the greatest monarchs the world ever\r\nproduced.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE DISCOVERY OF SIBERIA\r\n\r\nBut the most important event which distinguished this period of the\r\nreign of Ivan was the discovery of Siberia, an empire of extraordinary\r\nmagnitude, producing the richest furs, and studded with inexhaustible\r\nmines of salt, copper and silver. The discovery was accidental, and\r\ncaused at first so slight a degree of attention, that it was suffered\r\nto be forgotten until another accident, some years afterwards, recalled\r\nit to the consideration of the government. A body of men, who had been\r\nsent across the mountains of Ingermanland by the czar, penetrated as\r\nfar as the banks of the Oley; but the discoveries they reported were\r\neither so imperfect, or so ill-described, that they were passed over in\r\nsilence. It subsequently occurred, however, that a merchant of the name\r\nof Strogonov, who was the proprietor of some salt mines on the confines\r\nof Siberia, had his curiosity stimulated by several persons who traded\r\nwith him, and whose strange costume and foreign manners excited in him\r\na desire to become acquainted with the interior of the country from\r\nwhence they came. Accordingly he commissioned a few of his people to\r\nreturn with them into Siberia, and to collect such information respecting\r\nit as their opportunities might enable them to acquire. These people,\r\nhaving explored the unknown districts, which they found to be inhabited\r\nby a race of Tatars, who possessed a capital called Sibir, returned to\r\ntheir employer charged with a history of wonders, and a quantity of\r\ncostly furs, which promised to open a new source of gain to the diligent\r\nmerchant. Strogonov, however, resolved not to keep the knowledge he had\r\nthus attained exclusively to himself, and immediately communicated all he\r\nknew to the court. In the mean time, Iermak, a Don Cossack adventurer,\r\nwho, at the head of a gang of those lawless robbers, infested the roads,\r\nplundering the inhabitants and travellers in that part of Russia,\r\nhappened to come, accidentally, to the merchant’s dwelling, on his flight\r\nfrom some Russian troops that had been sent in search of him. While\r\nhe remained there, he learned by chance, from Strogonov, of the newly\r\ndiscovered land; and he and his band, being persons who had nothing to\r\nlose, and who subsisted solely by desperate predatory practices, resolved\r\nto enter the strange country, and seek in its unknown retreats a source\r\nof safety and support. The resistance this adventurer experienced from\r\nthe Siberians greatly thinned the ranks of his daring troops, but the\r\nforlorn character of the expedition inspired them with reckless valour;\r\nand, after many exhausting conflicts, they finally overran the country,\r\nand made themselves master of the capital. Iermak now bethought him\r\nof what he should do with his perilous conquest; and seeing that he\r\npossessed no means of accumulating sovereign power, or even of possessing\r\nby tribute, or otherwise, so vast a territory, he threw himself at the\r\nfeet of the czar, tendered to him the territory he had won, and solicited\r\nin return a full pardon for all the delinquencies he and his followers\r\nhad committed. Ivan readily granted the pardon, and took possession of\r\nhis new acquisition. The work of annexation went rapidly forward. Several\r\ncommodious towns were built, strong forts were constructed, the mines\r\nwere garrisoned, and that great expanse of desert and mountains, which\r\nwas afterwards destined to become the convict settlement of Russia, was\r\nformally and permanently consolidated in the dominions of the autocrat.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE RESTRAINING INFLUENCE OF ANASTASIA\r\n\r\nThe civil and social improvement of the empire kept pace with the armed\r\nprogress. A number of celebrated artists were engaged from the dominions,\r\nand by the permission, of Charles V; the art of letterpress printing was\r\nintroduced, and the first type that ever was seen in Russia was imported\r\nby Ivan; the northern parts were opened to a new mercantile intercourse;\r\nand Archangel was established. The laws were revised; and the fees of the\r\ngovernors of the provinces who administered justice, paying themselves\r\nby pecuniary mulcts on the suitors, were abolished, and in their place\r\ngratuitous justice was administered, and a general assessment levied,\r\nwhich was collected by officers appointed by government. The grasping\r\ndemands of the clergy were restrained, their revenues placed upon a\r\nmore equitable basis, and their morals improved by mild but decisive\r\nrestrictions.\r\n\r\nSuch were the fruits of the influence of Anastasia, which procured a\r\nhearing for the wisdom of Alexis and Sylvester. While that amiable and\r\nenlightened lady lived, Ivan pursued a course of just and wise measures\r\nthat reflected honour upon his name, and conferred extensive benefits\r\nupon his country. But the latent nature was not extinguished: it only\r\nslept, hushed into slumber by the sweet influences before which his\r\nsavage dispositions were subdued. An old bishop, who had formerly been\r\nbanished from the court on account of his crimes, and who was one day\r\nconsulted by Ivan, replied to the czar in some memorable words which\r\nwere ever afterwards cherished in his memory, and were not without their\r\npower over his subsequent life. “If you wish,” exclaimed the bishop,\r\n“to be truly a sovereign, never seek a counsellor wiser than yourself;\r\nnever receive advice from any man. Command, but never obey; and you\r\nwill be a terror to the boyars. Remember that he who is permitted to\r\nbegin advising, is certain to end by ruling, his sovereign.” Ivan,\r\nkissing the old man’s hand, is said to have answered, “My own father\r\ncould not have spoken more wisely!” This remarkable advice--similar\r\nto that which is attributed to a celebrated cardinal of modern times,\r\non his death-bed--seems to have governed the conduct of Ivan from the\r\nmoment that the death of the princess Anastasia released him from the\r\nembarrassment of her counsels. She died in 1560.\r\n\r\n\r\nIVAN’S ATROCITIES\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [1560 A.D.]]\r\n\r\nThe incarnate fiend, relieved from the oppressive presence of virtue,\r\nresumed at once his original nature. If the narrative of his crimes\r\ncould be spared from the page of history, it would rescue us from a\r\nseries of details, the very relation of which must sicken the least\r\nsusceptible mind. But there was a passion so unearthly in this paragon\r\nof monsters--he was so elevated in atrocity, and reached so sublime a\r\nheight in the perpetration of cruelties--that his life, incredible and\r\ndisgusting as it is, fills too great a space in the annals of despotism\r\nto be passed over lightly. One of his historians charitably supposes him\r\nto have been a lunatic.\r\n\r\nThe first act of Ivan was to banish his prudent advisers, the men who\r\nhad hitherto preserved him from the worst calamities. Those persons were\r\nreplaced by others, who studiously laboured to destroy their predecessors\r\nby false stories of their treachery to the czarina, whose death was\r\nunequivocally laid to their charge. That weakness, or superstition, which\r\nis an inherent quality in all savage natures, led Ivan to believe, or\r\nto fancy, that he believed those absurd accusations; and he acted with\r\npromptitude upon the miserable excuse which they afforded him. He hunted\r\nthe partisans of the late ministers wherever they could be detected;\r\nsome he put to the most disgraceful deaths, others he imprisoned or\r\nbanished, varying the monotony of their solitary lives by the infliction\r\nof exquisite tortures. One prince, who refused to join in the lascivious\r\npleasures of the court, was poinarded at prayers in the church; and\r\nanother was stabbed to the heart by the czar’s own hand, because he had\r\nthe presumption to remonstrate with one of the new favourites. The prince\r\nAndrew Kurbski, a noble who, both in the cabinet and the field, had\r\nrendered the most important services to the government and the country,\r\nreceived intimation that a similar fate awaited him; and, indignant at\r\nthe prospect of such an unworthy return for his devotion to the throne of\r\nthe czars, he retired into Lithuania, and united himself with Sigismund,\r\nthe king of Poland, and, at that time, one of the most formidable enemies\r\nof Russia. This revolt maddened Ivan beyond control; and his exasperation\r\nwas increased by the receipt of a letter from the prince, in which he\r\nboldly charged the czar with all the miseries that were entailed upon\r\ntheir common country, with having shed the blood of Israel’s elders\r\nin the temples of the Lord; and wound up by threatening him with the\r\nvengeance of that tribunal before which he must one day answer to the\r\naccusations of the spirits of the murdered. The messenger who was daring\r\nenough to present this epistle to the czar suffered for his temerity.\r\nIvan, on learning from whence he came, struck him across the legs with an\r\niron rod which he usually carried in his hand; and while the blood flowed\r\ncopiously from the wounds, leaned unconcernedly upon his rod to read the\r\nrebellious letter. The correspondence that ensued upon this occasion,\r\nlike all the correspondence of Ivan’s which has come down to us, is\r\nremarkable for the most blasphemous presumption and arrogant hyperbole.\r\nHe wrote all his letters with his own hand, and was proud of his literary\r\nattainments, which, had they been directed into worthier channels, might\r\nhave rendered him a distinguished ornament of his age.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE POLISH INVASION\r\n\r\nThe consequence of the disaffection of Kurbski was the enrolment of a\r\nPolish army with a view to a descent upon Russia, and an invasion of the\r\nsouthern provinces by the Tatars at the instigation of Sigismund. This\r\ndemonstration increased the rage of the czar: he treated everybody around\r\nhim as if they were the creatures of Kurbski: he distrusted everybody;\r\nand put numbers to the rack and to death on the bare suspicion of their\r\nguilt, and was overheard to lament that he could not find victims\r\nenough to satisfy his wrath. He charged the boyars indiscriminately\r\nwith harbouring secret designs against the welfare and happiness of the\r\nstate; he dispossessed many of them of their private fortunes; and in a\r\nletter which is still extant, he urged against them as crimes, all the\r\nbenefits which the sane portion of his rule had conferred upon Russia.\r\nIn this delirium of the fever of despotism, the clergy remonstrated\r\nwith some firmness; and, in order to obtain a fresh excuse for making\r\nnew victims, he adopted an expedient as unexpected as it was singular.\r\nHe caused a report to be spread on a sudden, that he was about to leave\r\nMoscow; but the point of his destination, or the reason of his withdrawal\r\nwere preserved as profound secrets. The mystery of this announcement\r\ncreated a panic at Moscow. The people knew not what was to come next,\r\nwhether the tyrant was about to put some scheme of universal destruction\r\ninto execution, or whether it was merely a prelude to some extravagant\r\nexhibition of superstitious credulity, which always assumed in their eyes\r\nthe aspect of religious devotion. Agreeably to this vague announcement\r\nof the czar’s design, one morning in December, at an early hour, the\r\ngreat square of the Kremlin was filled with travelling sledges, some of\r\nwhich contained gold and silver, others clothes, and not a few crosses,\r\nimages, and the relics of saints. These preparations attracted crowds of\r\nastonished gazers, who looked on in stupid wonder at the extraordinary\r\nsight. In a few minutes the czar, followed by his family, was seen to\r\ndescend from the palace, with the officers of his household, and a\r\nnumerous retinue. From the palace he passed on to the church of the\r\nAssumption; and, having ordered the metropolitan to celebrate mass, he\r\nprayed with great devotion, and received the blessing of Athanasius.\r\nReturning from the church, he held out his hand to the assembled\r\nmultitudes, that they might satisfy themselves with a farewell kiss;\r\nand then, having in silence, and with unusual solemnity, walked through\r\nthe groups that beset his path, he mounted his sledge, and drove off\r\naccompanied by a regiment of horse. The inhabitants of Moscow, astonished\r\nand terror-struck by the scene, were lost in conjecture. The city was\r\nwithout a government. Ivan had so dexterously contrived to impress them\r\nwith an idea that he derived his sovereignty from God, that he found\r\nno great difficulty ultimately in confounding to the imagination of an\r\nenslaved and uninstructed people the distinction between God and the\r\nsovereign; and in every crisis of disaster that occurred, the people fell\r\nback upon their fanaticism, and looked to the czar for that succour which\r\ncould alone come from heaven. Deserted at this moment by Ivan, they began\r\nto believe that they were deserted by Omnipotence.\r\n\r\nA month elapsed, and no tidings were received of the destination or\r\nproceedings of the czar. At length, at the end of that period, two\r\nletters were received from him; the one addressed to the metropolitan,\r\nthe other to the people. The former epistle contained a recapitulation\r\nof the disorders that had prevailed during his minority, all of which he\r\nattributed to the clergy and the boyars; and he asserted that similar\r\ncrimes against the majesty of the state were about to break out anew.\r\nHe also complained that his attempts to secure the public tranquillity\r\nwere constantly thwarted by the evil interference of Athanasius and the\r\nclergy; that, therefore, he had abandoned the helm of affairs, and had\r\nleft Moscow to wander about the earth. In his letter to the people, he\r\nassured them of his good will, repeated that he had no cause of complaint\r\nagainst them, and concluded by bidding them farewell for ever. It\r\nappeared by his epistles that he had intrenched himself in Alexandrovski,\r\na distant fortress that lay in the depths of a gloomy forest.\r\n\r\nThese communications spread dismay amongst the Muscovites. Ivan’s\r\nseverity towards the nobility and clergy had, even against the grain\r\nof reason, procured him no inconsiderable popularity with the bulk of\r\nthe people; and on this occasion it broke forth in lamentations, which\r\nderived much of their force from the association of the ideas of the\r\nthrone of the czar and the throne of heaven. Groups of disconsolate\r\ncitizens assembled in the street to confer upon what was to be done; the\r\nshops were shut, the tribunals of justice and public offices were closed,\r\nand every kind of business was suspended. “The czar,” they exclaimed,\r\n“has forsaken us, and we are lost. Who will now defend us against the\r\nenemy? what are sheep without the shepherd?” In this state of despair a\r\ndeputation of the principal inhabitants waited upon the metropolitan,\r\nand besought of him to solicit Ivan to return to his faithful subjects.\r\nFrantic with desperate zeal, they cried, “Let him punish all those who\r\ndeserve it; has he not the power of life and death? The state cannot\r\nremain without a head, and we will not acknowledge any other than the\r\none God has given us.” It was at last resolved that a numerous body of\r\nprelates and nobles should hasten to Alexandrovski, prostrate themselves\r\nin the dust before Ivan, and entreat of him to return to Moscow. This\r\nproceeding had the desired effect. They discovered Ivan in his retreat,\r\nstruck the ground before him with their heads, and supplicated him for\r\nthe sake of the souls of millions, which were now perishing in his\r\nabsence as the head of the orthodox church, to resume his holy functions.\r\nThis was what Ivan wanted: he affected to be much moved by their prayers,\r\nand with a show of reluctance consented to return, provided the clergy\r\npledged themselves not to interfere whenever he found it necessary to\r\npunish those who engaged in conspiracies against the state, or against\r\nhim or his family. This artful condition was immediately granted; and the\r\nmagnanimity of a tyrant who thus entrapped the people into an admission\r\nof the necessity of his despotic proceedings, was extolled to the skies.\r\n\r\nThe restoration of the despot was received with acclamations; but the\r\nMuscovites were astonished by the great alteration which had taken place\r\nin his personal appearance during his absence. Only a month, say their\r\nhistorians, had elapsed, yet they hardly knew him again. His powerful\r\nand muscular body, his expanded chest, and robust limbs, had shrunk to\r\na skeleton; his head, once covered with luxuriant locks, was now bald;\r\nhis rich and flowing beard was reduced to a few ragged stumps; his eyes\r\nwere dull; and his features, stamped with a ravenous ferocity, were now\r\ndeformed by apparent thought and anguish. Yet these sad changes,--the\r\nfearful effects of the incessant tortures of a mind bewildered by its own\r\nfury--excited the sympathies of the infatuated citizens who beheld them.\r\n\r\nAfter his entry into Moscow he addressed the people, again expatiating on\r\nthe crimes of the boyars and the necessity for exercising the dominant\r\nsovereign sway in its extreme development. To this succeeded a pious\r\nexhortation on the vanities of the world--one of the arguments by which\r\nhe endeavoured to reconcile his victims to their miserable fate--which\r\nhe concluded by a proposal to institute a new body-guard, to be composed\r\nof one thousand men of noble birth, chosen from the general body of the\r\narmy, and to be called the Opritshnina, or select legion. The people,\r\nblind to the danger of conceding so great a power to the sovereign,\r\nwillingly acceded to this proposal, the execution of which was but a new\r\ninstrument for destroying their liberties. The select legion, better\r\nknown in subsequent years by the name of the Strelitz, was the foundation\r\nof a regular standing army in Russia; for until the formation of that\r\ncorps the military force of the empire was raised upon occasions, each\r\nnobleman contributing according to his ability to meet the exigencies of\r\nthe demand.[32]\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE REIGN OF TERROR\r\n\r\nThis was the first step to the new reign of terror; and while the select\r\nlegion was in course of formation, Ivan employed himself in the erection\r\nof a new palace outside the walls of the Kremlin; for it appears that\r\nhis ambition or his fears produced in him a dislike for the ancient\r\nresidence of the royal family. In order to build this unnecessary palace,\r\nhe drove out all the inhabitants of the adjacent streets, and posted\r\nhis satellites around the neighbourhood to keep it free from intrusion.\r\nTwelve thousand of the richest inhabitants were dispossessed of their\r\nestates to make room for his designs, and upon the creatures of his\r\ndisgraceful bounty he bestowed the spoils of his plunder. The new palace\r\nwas to all intents an impregnable fortress; yet such were the secret\r\nhorrors engendered by his course of villanies, that Ivan, thinking that\r\nit was not sufficiently secure, retired again to Alexandrovski, which\r\nexpanded from an humble village into a considerable town. It contained\r\na celebrated church of our Lady, which was painted on the outside with\r\nthe most gaudy colors, every brick containing the representation of a\r\ncross. Here the czar possessed a large palace surrounded by a ditch and\r\nramparts: his civil and military functionaries had separate houses; and\r\nthe legionaries and trades-people had distinct streets. One of the rules\r\nimposed by the tyrant was that no person should enter or leave the town\r\nwithout his express permission, and a patrol constantly occupied the\r\nneighbourhood to observe that this order was fulfilled. A new notion\r\nnow possessed him. Buried in the forlorn solitudes of the deep forests,\r\nhe converted his palace into a monastery, assumed the style and title\r\nof abbot, turned his favourites into monks, and called his body of\r\nselect and depraved legionaries by the name of the Brothers. He provided\r\nthem all with black vestments, under which they wore splendid habits,\r\nembroidered with gold and fur; and he instituted a code of practice as\r\naustere as it was inconsistent. At three o’clock in the morning, the\r\nmatin service began, which lasted until seven; at eight mass commenced\r\nagain, and at ten the whole body, except Ivan, who stood reading aloud\r\nfrom some religious book, sat down to a sumptuous repast. The remnants of\r\nthe table were afterwards distributed amongst the poor--for throughout\r\nthe whole of Ivan’s actions there was always an evident desire to win\r\nthe favour of the multitude; the czar dined after the rest, and then\r\ndescended to the dungeons to witness the infliction of tortures upon\r\nsome of his victims, which gave him extraordinary delight. At eight\r\no’clock vespers were read; and at ten Ivan retired to his chamber, where\r\nhe was lulled to sleep by three blind men. To diversify this monotonous\r\nlife, he sometimes visited the monasteries, or hunted wild beasts in\r\nthe woods; but he was constantly employed in issuing his instructions\r\nupon public business, and even during prayers often gave his most cruel\r\nand sanguinary orders. Such was the life of the tyrant in his gloomy\r\nseclusion at Alexandrovski.\r\n\r\nDuring this period, the select legion increased in number to six thousand\r\nmen, embracing in their body all the abandoned and infamous wretches who\r\ncould be procured for hire. As types of their office, they were ordered\r\nto suspend from the saddle-bow a dog’s head and a broom--the former\r\nto signify that they worried the enemies of the czar, and the latter\r\nto indicate that they swept them off the face of the earth. They went\r\nfrom street to street armed with long daggers and hatchets in search of\r\nvictims, who amounted daily to a score. They soon became the objects\r\nof fear and execration. The first victims were the prince Shuiski and\r\nhis son. At the place of execution, the younger offered himself first\r\nto the axe; but the feelings of nature were so strong in the heart of\r\nthe parent, that he could not endure to witness the death of his son,\r\nand he insisted on receiving his death first. When his head rolled off,\r\nhis son embraced it in a passion of tears; and while the lips of the\r\nliving yet clung to the quivering and agonised features of the dead,\r\nthe executioner’s axe descended upon the son’s neck. On the same day\r\nfour other princes were beheaded, and a fifth impaled. Several boyars\r\nwere exiled, others forced to embrace the monastic vows, and a still\r\ngreater number were beggared by confiscation. These horrors increased\r\nevery day. The streets and squares were filled with dead bodies; and such\r\nwas the universal terror, that the survivors did not dare to appear to\r\ngive the rites of burial to the dead. It would appear that the murder\r\nof individuals ceased at length to satisfy the insatiate appetite of\r\nthe monster: he longed for massacre on a more extended scale; his eyes\r\ngrew tired of the slow process of execution in detail. Accordingly he\r\nsought for excuses to lay whole towns in blood. A few of the inhabitants\r\nof Tortchesk happening one day to quarrel with some of the legionaries,\r\nIvan declared them all to be rebels, and instantly caused them _en masse_\r\nto be either tortured to death or drowned. The inhabitants of Kolomua\r\nwere similarly disposed of, merely because they were the dependents of a\r\nnobleman who had outgrown his favour. He spared neither sex nor age. Many\r\nladies were exposed in the streets, and then shot in the public sight.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE MARCH AGAINST NOVGOROD\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [1569 A.D.]]\r\n\r\nThese atrocities, unparalleled in the annals of the world, form but the\r\nprelude to the enormous crimes of this infamous prince. His march of\r\ndevastation to Novgorod may be considered as the grand act of his career\r\nof blood. The provocation which led to the sanguinary punishment of that\r\ncity was a falsehood invented by a profligate fellow who wanted to escape\r\njustice, and to take refuge upon the authorities, who had found him\r\nguilty of the commission of some offences. This criminal, knowing that\r\nIvan rewarded all those who came before him with charges of disaffection,\r\nwrote a letter in the name of the archbishop and inhabitants of Novgorod\r\nto the king of Poland, offering to put the city under that monarch’s\r\nprotection. This letter he carefully concealed behind an image of the\r\nVirgin in the church of St. Sophia, and then laid before the czar at\r\nMoscow a private revelation of the conspiracy which he had himself\r\ninvented. Ivan despatched a trusty messenger to Novgorod, who discovered\r\nthe letter in the spot to which the informer had referred, and, upon this\r\nevidence, the city was denounced to the vengeance of the select legion.\r\nBut as it was likely that the sight of this dreadful deed would be more\r\nexciting than any he had hitherto witnessed, Ivan put himself at the head\r\nof his guards, and in December 1569, accompanied by his son, departed\r\nfrom Alexandrovski on his mission of destruction.\r\n\r\nOn his way he passed through the town of Klin, and exterminated the whole\r\nof the population. When he arrived at the city of Tver, he took up his\r\nquarters at a monastery outside the gates, and sent his soldiers into the\r\ncity to massacre and plunder the inhabitants at will. The horrors of the\r\nscene reminded the unfortunate people of the terrible cruelties inflicted\r\nupon their ancestors by the khan Usbak in 1327. At some of the feats of\r\ndeath, Ivan himself assisted: and his confidential minister Skuratov\r\nsecretly entered the cell of a monastery where the virtuous and deposed\r\nmetropolitan was confined, and strangled him.\r\n\r\nProceeding onwards from Tver, Ivan depopulated all the towns on his route\r\nto the banks of the Ilmen: and on the 2d of January his advanced guard\r\nentered the devoted and miserable city of Novgorod. The preparations\r\nmade upon this occasion to ensure the complete carnage meditated by the\r\ntyrant, are memorable proofs of the coolness with which the demons of the\r\nOpritshnina executed the will of their savage leader. They ordered the\r\nchurches and convents to be closed, and demanded a temporary levy from\r\nthe monks of twenty roubles per head; and such unfortunate ecclesiastics\r\nas were unable to comply with this exorbitant exaction were deliberately\r\nflogged from morning till night. The houses of the inhabitants were\r\nplaced under seizure, and guarded at the entrances, and the owners thrown\r\ninto chains. This was merely preliminary to the arrival of the monarch.\r\n\r\nIn four days afterwards Ivan and the remainder arrived, and rested\r\nwithin two versts of the city. On the following morning all the monks\r\nwho had failed to pay the redemption tax were taken out, beaten to\r\ndeath with clubs, and their bodies sent to their respective monasteries\r\nfor interment. On the next day, accompanied as before by his son, Ivan\r\nmade his solemn entrance at the head of his troops into the city. The\r\narchbishop, with the clergy, carrying the miraculous images, met him on\r\nthe bridge, and attempted to utter the accustomed benediction: but Ivan,\r\ninterrupting the ceremony, addressed them in a long harangue, which\r\nconsisted of an elaborate curse against their order. Having satisfied his\r\nrage by the delivery of this anathema, he ordered the crucifix and images\r\nto be borne into the church of St. Sophia, where he heard mass, praying\r\nwith great fervour, and then retired to the episcopal palace, where he\r\nsat down to dinner surrounded by his boyars. Suddenly, in the midst\r\nof the feast, he started up and raised a terrible cry. The signal was\r\nscarcely given when his satellites, as if by magic, appeared in a body\r\nbefore him, and seized the archbishop, and the officers and servants.\r\nThe palace and the cloisters were then given up to plunder. The czar’s\r\nconfessor, assisted in the sacrilege by the master of the ceremonies,\r\nburst into the cathedral and carried off its sacred treasures, the rich\r\nvestments, the images, and the bells. The churches and monasteries were\r\nall pillaged, and not a fragment of the precious accumulations of the\r\ntemples and religious houses escaped the impious hands of the spoliators.\r\n\r\nNext came the massacre of the inhabitants, which was conducted with\r\nthe utmost patience and regularity. Every day from five hundred to\r\none thousand Novgorodians were brought before Ivan and his son, and\r\nimmediately put to death either by torture or fire. Some were tied to\r\nsledges and dragged into the Volkhov; others flung over the bridge into\r\nthe river--wives with their husbands, mothers with their tender infants;\r\nwhile soldiers armed with long sharp spears sailed on the water to pierce\r\nand hew those who attempted to escape by swimming. When the massacre\r\nhad continued in this way for five weeks, Ivan drew off and visited the\r\nneighbouring monasteries, which he pillaged indiscriminately, levelling\r\nhouses, destroying cattle, and burning the corn. He then returned to\r\nNovgorod, and inspected in person the remaining work of destruction. He\r\npassed through the streets while his myrmidons plundered the shops and\r\nhouses, which were entered by the doors or windows indifferently: rich\r\nsilks and furs were divided by the brutal soldiery, and all unavailable\r\ngoods, such as hemp and wax and tallow, were either burnt or cast into\r\nthe river. Detachments were then sent into the adjacent domains to\r\nplunder and murder without any respect of persons.\r\n\r\nHaving exhausted all his arts of ruin, Ivan now relaxed, and issued a\r\ngeneral pardon to the few wretched persons who survived, and to whom\r\ndeath would have been an act of mercy. He summoned them to appear before\r\nhim; and a ghastly assemblage of skeletons, motionless and in despair,\r\nstood in the presence of the murderer like ghosts invoked from the grave.\r\nUntouched by the appalling sight, he addressed them in the mildest\r\nlanguage, desired to have their prayers that he might have a long and\r\nhappy reign, and took his leave of them in the most gracious words. The\r\nmiserable inhabitants were smote with delirium; they looked around them\r\nin vain for the friends that had been sacrificed, for the houses and the\r\nwealth that had been laid waste. Sixty thousand victims were stretched\r\ndead in the streets of the once proud and opulent republic: and to\r\ncomplete its melancholy doom, pestilence and a famine succeeded, sweeping\r\noff nearly all those who had survived the extermination of the less\r\nmerciful czar. The city was now entirely depopulated, and presented the\r\nsepulchral aspect of a vast cemetery.\r\n\r\nThe monster passed on to the city of Pskov, where, however, he consented\r\nto forego his terrible schemes of destruction, satisfying himself with\r\nplundering the principal inhabitants. He then returned home to Moscow,\r\nloaded with plunder, and carrying in his train the archbishop of\r\nNovgorod, and other distinguished victims, whom he reserved for a public\r\nexecution.\r\n\r\n\r\nCARNAGE IN MOSCOW\r\n\r\nHe had no sooner arrived in Moscow than he caused several of his\r\nfavourites to be arrested on the ground of suspicion, but really in order\r\nto increase the number of the wretches he designed to put to death;\r\nand thus, naming a day for a general execution of the whole, extensive\r\npreparations were made in the market place to carry his inhuman project\r\ninto execution. Eighteen gibbets were erected, numberless instruments of\r\ntorture were exhibited, and a great fire was made in the centre, over\r\nwhich a huge copper cauldron was suspended. The inhabitants, seeing these\r\ndreadful preliminaries, believed that the czar’s object was to set the\r\ncity on fire, and consign the people to death; and, flying from the spot,\r\nthey abandoned their shops and merchandise, leaving their property to the\r\nmercy of the select legion. In a few hours Moscow was utterly deserted,\r\nand not a living person was to be seen but a troop of the Opritshnina\r\nranged in gloomy silence round the gibbets and blazing fire. Presently\r\nthe beating of drums rose upon the air, and the czar was seen advancing\r\non horseback, accompanied by his favourite son, and followed by his\r\ndevoted guards. In the rear came the spectral troop of victims, in number\r\nabout three hundred, wan and bloody, and hardly able to crawl upon the\r\nground. On perceiving that the theatre of carnage was destitute of an\r\naudience, Ivan commanded his soldiers to collect the inhabitants; and,\r\nafter a short pause, finding that they did not arrive with promptitude,\r\nhe went in person to demand their presence at the treat he had prepared\r\nfor them, assuring them at the same time of the good-will he entertained\r\ntowards them. The wretched Muscovites dared not disobey him, and hurrying\r\nin terror from their hiding places, they crowded to the scene of\r\nexecution, which was speedily filled with spectators even to the roofs of\r\nthe houses. Then the dreadful rites began. The czar addressed the people\r\nwith exclamations upon the righteousness of the punishments he was about\r\nto inflict, and the people, oppressed with horror, replied in terms of\r\napprobation. A crowd of one hundred and twenty victims, who were declared\r\nto be less guilty than the rest, were first separated from the others and\r\npardoned. The condemned were called one by one, and some, after hearing\r\nthe accusation in general terms from the lips of the czar, accompanied\r\nby occasional blows on the head from a whip which he held in his hand,\r\nwere given over to the assassins, who hung them up by the feet, and then\r\ncut them to pieces, or plunged them half alive into the boiling cauldron.\r\nThese executions, which are too horrible to be related in detail, lasted\r\nfor about four hours; during which time nearly two hundred victims,\r\ninnocent of the crimes with which they were charged, suffered deaths of\r\nthe most exquisite and prolonged agony.\r\n\r\nA despotism so sanguinary and so wanton was well calculated to\r\nendanger the safety of those institutions which the wisdom of others\r\nhad established. Russia, distracted through all her provinces by the\r\natrocities of Ivan, soon became a prey to those unwearied foes who never\r\nlost an opportunity of taking advantage of her domestic difficulties.\r\nThe declaration of Ivan’s supremacy to his unfortunate subjects was, “I\r\nam your god as God is mine; whose throne is surrounded by archangels,\r\nas is the throne of God.” But this piece of blasphemy, which had the\r\neffect of making the Russians tremble, only increased the determination\r\nof his external enemies. Sweden had already wrested Esthonia from him;\r\nKettler, the last grand-master of the Livonian knights, satisfied himself\r\nwith Courland and Semigallia; while Battori of Poland, the successor of\r\nSigismund Augustus, deprived him of Livonia, one of the most important\r\npoints in his dominions. In 1566, Ivan laid before an assembly of the\r\nstates-general, consisting of a convocation of ecclesiastics, nobles,\r\ncitizens, and traders, a statement of his negotiations with Poland on the\r\nsubject of Livonia; but as his real object was to assert his tyrannical\r\npower rather than to gain the political advantages he pointed out, the\r\nissue of the assembly was merely an admission from all the parties\r\npresent that the will of the czar was indisputable, and that they had no\r\nright even to tender him their advice. The great advantage of recovering\r\nLivonia from Poland was obviously to secure it as an outlet upon the\r\nBaltic for Russian commerce, and as a means of opening a communication\r\nwith Europe. To the ministry of Sylvester and Adaschev belongs the\r\ncredit of this admirable project; but a design which they would have\r\naccomplished with comparative facility, was suffered by Ivan to be wasted\r\nin fruitless contentions.\r\n\r\nBattori terrified Ivan in the midst of his tyrannies; and the monster who\r\ncould visit his people with such an example of cruelties, crouched before\r\nthe king of Poland. His fear of Battori carried him to extremes. He not\r\nonly supplicated terms at his hands, but suffered him to offer personal\r\ninsults to the officers who represented the czar at his court. The\r\ngrovelling measures and cowardice of Ivan disgusted his adversary; and in\r\nreply to some fresh instance of dastardly submission, Battori charged him\r\nwith the grossest crimes--with having falsified the articles of treaties,\r\nand applied inhuman tortures to his peoples. The letter containing\r\nthese strong, but just, animadversions, closed with a challenge to\r\nsingle combat, which the poverty of the czar’s spirit met by renewed\r\nprotestations of the most abject character.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE STRUGGLE FOR LIVONIA\r\n\r\nAt length, urged by the clamour of his advisers, Ivan organised an army\r\nof three hundred thousand men; but, although he could instigate and\r\nassist at the most revolting punishments, he shrunk from a personal share\r\nin the numerous petty conflicts which took place between his forces\r\nand the Livonian knights. Instead of advancing boldly upon the enemy,\r\nwho could not have maintained war against the superior numbers of the\r\nRussians, he suffered himself to be shielded by a jesuit, the pope’s\r\nenvoy, whose intercession with Battori he had procured by representing,\r\nwith consummate audacity, that he hoped to be able to effect the\r\nconversion of the Russians to catholicism. Whenever he fell in with\r\nthe Livonians, and the collision terminated in victory, he committed\r\nthe wildest excesses: plundered the captives of their wealth, which he\r\ntransmitted to his own private coffers, and then sentenced the prisoners\r\nto be flung into boiling cauldrons, spitted on lances, or roasted at\r\nfires which he amused himself by stirring--while the sacrificial murders\r\nwere in progress. Wars so irregularly conducted, and terminating in such\r\nfrightful revenge could not but entail calamities upon the empire. All\r\nthat was gained by the long struggle for Livonia, was the occasional\r\nplunder which Ivan appropriated to himself.\r\n\r\nTo support the system of profligate expenditure to which the whole life\r\nof this extraordinary man inevitably led, he laid on the most exorbitant\r\ntaxes, and lent himself to the most unjust monopolies. Nor was he\r\nsatisfied with exceeding in this way the most arbitrary examples that had\r\npreceded him; but, with a recklessness of human life, and a disregard of\r\nthe common decencies and obligations of the worst condition of society,\r\nhe proceeded to rifle his subjects of their private means, sometimes upon\r\nslight pretences, but oftener without any pretence whatever. It would\r\nalmost appear that his appetite for sights of destruction had palled with\r\nordinary gratification; and that he had jaded his invention to discover\r\nnew modes of cruelty. Having exhausted in all its varieties the mere art\r\nof slaughter, he proceeded to make his objects violate before his eyes\r\nthe sacred feelings of nature. He demanded fratricide and parricide at\r\ntheir hands: one man was forced to kill his father, another his brother:\r\neight hundred women were drowned, and, bursting into the houses of his\r\nvictims, he compelled the survivors to point out the places where the\r\nremnant of their wealth was concealed. His excesses carried him beyond\r\nall law, human and divine. He assumed the place, and even usurped the\r\nattributes of the Deity, and identified himself to a proverb with the\r\nCreator. Not content with indulging his insane passions in the frenzy of\r\nan undisciplined mind, he trampled the usages of Russia under foot, and\r\nmarried seven wives--which was held by the tenets of the Greek religion\r\nto be a crime of great magnitude.[g]\r\n\r\n\r\nPROJECTS OF ALLIANCE WITH ENGLAND\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [1582-1584 A.D.]]\r\n\r\nThe unfortunate issue of the war with Sweden did not however make Ivan\r\nthe Terrible give up the idea of compensating himself for his losses; he\r\ncontinued to seek for alliances with European states. With this object\r\nTheodore Pissemski was sent to England in 1582 with instructions to\r\nendeavour to bring about a close alliance with Elizabeth against his\r\nenemy the king of Poland, and at the same time to enter into matrimonial\r\nnegotiations for the czar with the queen’s relative, Maria Hastings. The\r\nEnglish would not entertain either project, but only sought to obtain an\r\nexemption from entry duties for their trade with Russia. In 1583 Jeremiah\r\nBowes was sent to Moscow from England with the delicate mission of\r\nattaining this object. The negotiations dragged on a long time; first the\r\nczar sent away Bowes and then recalled him again, and in fact they had\r\nnot come to an end before the death of Ivan the Terrible.[b]\r\n\r\n\r\nDEATH OF IVAN THE TERRIBLE\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [1584 A.D.]]\r\n\r\nWe have already seen what was the life of Ivan: we shall now see its\r\nending--which was equally astonishing--desirable indeed for mankind,\r\nbut terrifying to the imagination; for the tyrant died as he had lived,\r\nthat is, exterminating men, although in contemporary narratives there is\r\nno mention of his last victims.[33] Strong in bodily constitution, Ivan\r\nhad hoped for a long life; but what bodily strength could withstand the\r\nfurious rage of the passions that agitated the sombre existence of the\r\ntyrant? The continued outbursts of wrath and fear, the racking of the\r\nunrepentant conscience, the odious transports of abominable sensuality,\r\nthe torments of shame, the impotent fury at the reverses of his arms,\r\nfinally the horrible remembrance of the murder of his own son, had\r\nexhausted the measure of Ivan’s strength. At times he experienced a\r\npainful languor, the precursory symptom of dissolution, but he struggled\r\nagainst it and did not noticeably weaken until the winter of the year\r\n1584. At that time a comet appeared in the sky between the churches of\r\nIvan the Great and of the Annunciation, which had the form of a cross.\r\nCurious to see it, Ivan went out on the red staircase, gazed at it long,\r\ngrew pale, and said to those around him: “there is the portent of my\r\ndeath.” Pursued by this idea, it is said that he caused astrologers and\r\npretended magicians to be sought for throughout Russia and Lapland,\r\nbrought together about sixty of them, assigned to them a house in Moscow,\r\nand daily sent his favourite Belski, to confer with them concerning the\r\ncomet. Soon he fell dangerously ill. It is said that the astrologers\r\npredicted his death on the 18th of March. During February he was still\r\nable to occupy himself with affairs; but on the 10th of March a courier\r\nwas despatched to delay the arrival of the Lithuanian ambassador who was\r\non his way to Moscow, by reason of the illness of the czar. Ivan himself\r\nhad given the order; he had still hopes of recovery, nevertheless he\r\ncalled together the boyars and commanded that his will and testament\r\nshould be written down. He declared the czarevitch Theodore heir to\r\nthe throne and monarchy, and chose well-known men for councillors to\r\nwatch over the prosperity of the state and lighten for Theodore (who\r\nwas feeble both in mind and body) the burden of the cares of the state;\r\nthese men were: Prince Ivan Petrovitch Shuiski (the famous defender of\r\nPskov), Ivan Mstislavski, son of a niece of the grand prince Vasili,\r\nNikita Romanovitch Iuriev (brother of Ivan’s first wife, the virtuous\r\nAnastasia), Boris Godunov, and Belski. To the young Dmitri and his mother\r\nhe assigned the town of Uglitch as appanage, the boy’s education to be\r\nexclusively confided to Belski. He declared his gratitude to all his\r\nboyars and voyevods, calling them his friends and companions in arms in\r\nthe conquest of unbelieving kingdoms, in the victories gained over the\r\nknights of the Livonian order, the khan, and the sultan. He exhorted\r\nTheodore to rule piously, lovingly and mercifully, advising him and the\r\nfive chief dignitaries of the state to avoid war with Christian powers.\r\nHe spoke of the disastrous consequences of the wars with Lithuania and\r\nSweden, deplored the exhaustion of Russia, enjoined a reduction of the\r\ntaxes and the liberation of all captives, even of the Lithuanian and\r\nGerman prisoners.\r\n\r\nThe strength of the sick man presently left him; his thoughts were\r\nbeclouded; stretched in unconsciousness upon his bed, Ivan called loudly\r\nfor his murdered son, imagined he saw him and spoke to him tenderly. On\r\nthe 17th of March he felt better from the effects of a warm bath, so\r\nthat he commanded the Lithuanian ambassador to come without delay from\r\nMozhaisk to Moscow. The next day (if Horsey is to be believed) he said\r\nto Belski, “Go and tell those liars, the astrologers, that they shall\r\ndie: according to their fables I am to die now, but I feel a great deal\r\nbetter.” But, answered the astrologers, the day has not yet passed. A\r\nbath was again prepared for the czar in which he remained about three\r\nhours, then he lay down on his bed and rested. Soon he asked for a\r\nchessboard, and sitting up in bed in his dressing-gown, he himself set\r\nup the chessmen and wanted to play with Belski.[34] Suddenly he fell\r\nback and closed his eyes for all eternity. The doctors rubbed him with\r\nstrengthening fluids, while the metropolitan--probably fulfilling the\r\nwill of Ivan that had been long known to him--read the prayers for the\r\ntaking of orders over the dying man, giving him the monastic names of\r\nJonas. During these moments a deep silence reigned throughout the palace\r\nand the capital; people waited in expectancy, but nobody dared to ask.\r\nIvan lay already dead, yet he appeared still terrible to the surrounding\r\ncourtiers, who for a long time could not believe their eyes and did not\r\nannounce his death. On the third day magnificent obsequies took place in\r\nthe church of St. Michael.\r\n\r\n\r\nKARAMZIN’S ESTIMATE OF IVAN\r\n\r\nAmidst the various and heavy trials imposed by destiny on Russia, besides\r\nthe miseries of the feudal or appanage system, besides the Mongolian\r\nyoke, Russia had also to bear the ferocity of the autocrat-tormentor: yet\r\nshe preserved her love for autocracy, believing that plagues, earthquakes\r\nand tyrants are sent by God. Instead of breaking the iron sceptre in\r\nthe hands of Ivan, she bore for twenty-four years with the destroyer,\r\narming herself solely with prayer and patience in order that in happier\r\ntimes she might have a Peter the Great, a Catherine II (history does not\r\nlike to name the living[35]). Magnanimously submissive, the martyrs\r\ndied on the scaffold like the Greeks at Thermopylæ, for their country,\r\ntheir faith and fealty, without thought of rebellion or riot. In order\r\nto excuse Ivan’s cruelties some foreign historians have spoken of plots\r\nand conspiracies against which they were directed; but such plots only\r\nexisted in the troubled mind of the czar, as all our chronicles and state\r\npapers bear witness. The clergy, the boyars, the prominent citizens would\r\nnot have called forth the wild beast from his lair of Alexandrovski,\r\nif they had had thoughts of the treachery imputed to them with as much\r\nabsurdity as witchcraft. No, the tiger gorged himself with the blood of\r\nthe lambs, and his victims, casting a last glance on the distressful\r\nearth, demanded from their contemporaries and from posterity both justice\r\nand compassionate remembrance.\r\n\r\nIn spite of all speculative explanations, the character of Ivan, a\r\nvirtuous hero in his youth, and an insatiable, bloody tyrant in the years\r\nof his manhood and old age, remains an enigma, and we should doubt the\r\ntruth of the most trustworthy narratives concerning him, if the history\r\nof other nations did not show us equally astonishing examples; if for\r\ninstance Caligula, at first a model for sovereigns and afterwards a\r\nmonster of cruelty--if Nero, the pupil of the wise Seneca, an object of\r\nlove and an object of loathing, had not reigned at Rome.\r\n\r\nThus Ivan possessed a superior intellect, he was not uneducated, and\r\nhis knowledge was united to an uncommon gift of speech, yet he was the\r\nshameless slave of the most abominable vices. He had an unusually fine\r\nmemory, he knew the Bible by heart, he was also well acquainted with\r\nGreek and Roman history, besides the history of his own country, and only\r\nused his knowledge in order to give the most absurd interpretations in\r\nfavour of tyranny. He boasted of his firmness and self control, because\r\nhe could laugh loudly in the hour of fear and of inward uneasiness.\r\nHe boasted of his clemency and generosity, because he enriched his\r\nfavourites with the possessions of the boyars and citizens who had\r\nfallen into disgrace. He boasted of his justice, and punished with\r\nequal satisfaction the meritorious and the criminal. He boasted of his\r\nsovereign spirit and of knowing how to maintain the sovereign dignity,\r\nordering that an elephant which had been sent to him from Persia should\r\nbe cut to pieces because the animal would not kneel before him, and\r\ncruelly punishing the unfortunate courtiers who dared to play at cards\r\nor chess better than his majesty. Finally he prided himself on his deep\r\nstatecraft in exterminating systematically, at certain fixed epochs,\r\nwith cold blooded calculation, some of the most illustrious families\r\nunder the pretext of their being dangerous to the royal power; raising\r\nto their rank new and mean families; touching with his destroying hand\r\neven the future, for like a swarm of famine-bringing insects, the band of\r\ninformers, of calumniators, of “_opritchniki_”[36] that he had formed,\r\nleft, as they disappeared, the seed of evil among the people, and if the\r\nyoke of Bati had lowered the spirit of the Russians, there is no doubt\r\nthat the reign of Ivan did nothing to raise it.\r\n\r\nBut justice must be rendered even to a tyrant: even in the extremity of\r\nevil, Ivan at times seems the phantom, as it were, of a great monarch,\r\nzealous, unwearying, often showing proofs of great penetration in\r\nstate matters. For valour he liked to compare himself to Alexander of\r\nMacedonia, although there was not a shadow of courage in his soul: yet\r\nhe was a conqueror; in his outward policy he followed unswervingly the\r\ngreat schemes of his grandfather. He wanted justice to be observed in\r\nthe tribunals, and not frequently himself examined the lawsuits, listened\r\nto complaints, read every paper laid before him, and was prompt in\r\nhis decisions. He punished the oppressors of the people, unscrupulous\r\nfunctionaries, and extortioners, both corporally and by putting them\r\nto shame (he had them clothed in sumptuous attire, seated in carts and\r\ndriven by the hangmen through the streets). He forbade all drunken\r\nexcesses and only allowed the people to divert themselves in the public\r\nhouses during the Easter holidays and at Christmastide; at every other\r\ntime drunken people were sent to prison. Although he did not like daring\r\nreproaches, yet at times Ivan detested coarse flattery; of the latter\r\nwe will give an instance: The voyevods, the princes Shtcherbati and\r\nIri Boriatinski, who had been ransomed by the czar from captivity in\r\nLithuania, were honoured with his favour, were given presents, and had\r\nthe distinction of dining with him. He questioned them about Lithuania.\r\nShtcherbati spoke the truth, but Boriatinski lied shamelessly, averring\r\nthat the king had neither troops nor fortresses and trembled at the name\r\nof Ivan. “Poor king!” said Ivan quietly, shaking his head: “how I pity\r\nthee!” and suddenly seizing his staff he broke it to splinters over\r\nBoriatinski’s back, saying: “Take that, you shameless fellow, for your\r\nflagrant lying!”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CATHEDRAL OF ST. BASIL, MOSCOW\r\n\r\n(Built by Ivan the Terrible, who considered it so beautiful that he had\r\nthe architect’s eyes put out that he might not build another)]\r\n\r\nIvan was distinguished by a wise tolerance in matters of religion\r\n(excepting that of the Jews); but although he at first allowed the\r\nLutherans and the Calvinists to have churches in Moscow, five years later\r\nhe ordered their churches to be burned. It is possible, however, that he\r\nhad heard of the people’s dissatisfaction and was afraid of some scandal;\r\nin any case he did not hinder their meeting for worship in the houses of\r\ntheir pastors. He was fond of disputing with learned Germans upon matters\r\nof faith and was not angry at contradiction: thus in the year 1570 he\r\nhad a solemn discussion in the palace of the Kremlin with the Lutheran\r\ntheologian Rotsita, whom he accused of heresy: Rotsita was seated before\r\nhim on a raised platform covered with rich carpets; he spoke boldly in\r\ndefence of the dogmas of the Augsburg Confession, and was honoured with\r\ntokens of the czar’s favour.\r\n\r\nIvan evinced esteem for the arts and sciences, showing marks of\r\nfavour to educated foreigners. Although he did not found academies,\r\nyet he contributed to popular education by increasing the number of\r\necclesiastical schools where the laity also could study reading, writing,\r\nreligion, and even history, and in particular prepare to become clerks\r\nin the chanceries; to the shame of the boyars, many of whom were not yet\r\nable to write. Finally Ivan is famous in Russian history as a lawgiver\r\nand organiser of the state.[f]\r\n\r\n\r\nIVAN THE TERRIBLE COMPARED WITH PETER THE GREAT\r\n\r\nDeeply tragic were the life and destiny of Ivan the Terrible! As we\r\npenetrate into the full signification of his work, we are involuntarily\r\ndrawn to the comparison which suggests itself between him and the\r\nhero czar of the eighteenth century. It was not without reason that,\r\naccording to tradition, Peter looked upon Ivan as his precursor: they\r\nhad both entertained the same projects. Even in the circumstances of\r\ntheir childhood and early youth there were points of resemblance; but\r\nIvan had not a tender, loving mother at his side, and this difference\r\nwas an essential one. There is also another very essential difference:\r\nby nature Ivan was a man of more abstract character, less capable of and\r\nless inclined to practical activity; for this reason he at times confided\r\nin others, then suddenly became suspicious, but never acted himself. It\r\nappeared to him that the duty of a czar was only to direct the activity\r\nof others. Although this is a true view in ordinary times, it may\r\nsometimes become a false one, and Peter served Russia as much with the\r\ncarpenter’s hatchet as he did with the sword of Pultowa. The practical\r\nPeter believed in his people, and if at times he overstrained the bow,\r\nyet it was as if he felt that matters would adjust themselves. Ivan\r\nlost faith in everything and everyone; it may also be added that Peter\r\nthought less of himself and in this respect he was larger minded than his\r\nterrible predecessor. The painful impression produced on the historian\r\nby Ivan’s trying to secure a refuge in England, has no parallel in the\r\nlife of Peter. Also, however terrible were the executions and punishments\r\nin the time of Peter, and although at times there may be observed in\r\nthem signs of personal irritation, yet the impression produced by the\r\nnarrative of the devastations in Novgorod is still more distressing.\r\nPractical statesmen never go to such lengths as abstract theorists: Peter\r\nnever entered into theoretical controversies, which were foreign to his\r\nnature. For the same reason Peter, however well disposed he might be\r\ntowards foreigners, always counted himself a Russian, while Ivan took\r\npleasure in tracing the descent of his race from Cæsar Augustus. It was\r\nalso for this reason that Peter could not entirely abase himself in\r\nsensual delights; he had too much work on his hands; his was a practical,\r\nnot a contemplative nature. And this is one of the principal causes of\r\nPeter’s success and Ivan’s failure; another and more important reason\r\nlies in the fact that Russia was weaker in the time of the Terrible czar\r\nthan in the time of Peter the Great.[b]\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES\r\n\r\n[24] From _ókolo_, about, around--persons about the czar.\r\n\r\n[25] _Gospodá_, plural of _gospodin_.\r\n\r\n[26] Literally “beat his forehead.”\r\n\r\n[27] Daughter of Stephen, Gospodin of Moldavia, married to Ivan’s son\r\nIvan.\r\n\r\n[28] [A title borne by the Russian emperors.]\r\n\r\n[29] Mengli Girai’s rivals: Adir, Nordovlat, and Zenebek, fled to Moscow\r\nand were detained by Ivan, who thus rendered Mengli Girai a service at\r\nthe same time that he held out their liberation as a tacit menace.[a]\r\n\r\n[30] Soloviov[h] decisively confutes the story that the cause of Ahmed’s\r\nretreat was the destruction of Sarai by Nordovlat.\r\n\r\n[31] Thus the courtiers regarded it as a matter of course that he should\r\ntake away from his envoys the gifts made to them by the sovereigns to\r\nwhom they had been accredited.\r\n\r\n[32] [The Opritshnina, composed at first, or proposed to be composed, of\r\nmen of noble birth, was really filled by persons of the lowest class, who\r\nacted as spies, informers and assassins.]\r\n\r\n[33] Oderborn says that a few days before his death Ivan had six noblemen\r\nexecuted.

THE CENTURY AFTER IVAN THE TERRIBLE\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [1584-1682 A.D.]]\r\n\r\nIvan left two sons, Feodor and Dmitri, the first of whom, at twenty-two\r\nyears of age, succeeded him. The second, born in 1581, was sprung from\r\na seventh marriage, contracted by Ivan in contempt of the canons of the\r\nGreek church, which recognises no union as legitimate after the fourth\r\nwidowhood. Notwithstanding this circumstance, the right of Dmitri to the\r\ntitle of czarevitch was not disputed, and he was even regarded as the\r\npresumptive heir to the crown, as the feeble health of Feodor rendered it\r\nextremely probable that he would die without issue.\r\n\r\nThe character of the new czar contrasted strangely with that of his\r\nfather. Gentle and timid as a child, and devout even to superstition,\r\nFeodor spent his days in prayer, or in listening to and commenting\r\nupon pious legends. He was constantly to be seen in the churches, and\r\nhe frequently took delight in ringing the bells himself, to call the\r\nfaithful to divine service. “He is a sacristan,” said Ivan the Terrible,\r\n“not a czarevitch.” When not engaged in devotional exercises, Feodor\r\nused to shut himself up with his buffoons; or else, from a balcony, he\r\nwould watch his huntsmen combating with bears. To a mind so weak, the\r\ncares of government were insupportable; and he therefore lost no time in\r\ntransferring them to one of his own favourites, the boyard Boris Godunov,\r\nhis brother-in-law. He first bestowed upon him the office of master of\r\nthe horse, and attached to that title many important duties and immense\r\npower. Shortly afterwards, by a public confession of his own incapacity,\r\nhe appointed him _pravitel_, or regent of the empire.[b]\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARACTER OF BORIS GODUNOV\r\n\r\nFrom that time on, for eighteen years, the destiny of the Russian\r\nmonarchy and people was bound up with the personality of Boris Godunov.\r\nHis family traced its origin from the Tatar prince (_mourza_) Tchet,\r\nwho in the fourteenth century had been baptised in the horde by\r\nthe metropolitan Peter and had settled in Russia under the name of\r\nZacharias. The Ipatski monastery, erected by him near Kostroma, was\r\na monument of the piety of the newly baptised Tatar; it became the\r\nholy place of his descendants, who provided for it by their offerings\r\nand were buried there. The grandson of Zacharias, Ivan Godum, was the\r\nforefather of that branch of the family of Prince Tchet which from the\r\nappellation of Godum received the name of Godunov. The posterity of\r\nGodum flourished remarkably; the Godunovs owned estates, but they did\r\nnot play an important rôle in Russian history until the time when one\r\nof the great-grandsons of the first Godunov had the honour of becoming\r\nthe father-in-law of the czarevitch Feodor Ivanovitch. Then there\r\nappeared at the court of Ivan the Terrible the brother of Feodor’s\r\nwife, Boris, who was married to a daughter of the czar’s favourite,\r\nMaluta Skuratov. Ivan liked him. The exaltation of persons and families\r\nthrough relationship with the czaritsas was a very ordinary occurrence\r\nin the history of Moscow, but such exaltation was often precarious. The\r\nrelatives of Ivan’s wives were destroyed as freely as the other victims\r\nof his bloodthirstiness. Boris himself, by his nearness to the czar,\r\nwas in imminent peril, and it is reported that Ivan wounded him badly\r\nwith his staff when Boris interceded for the czarevitch Ivan, murdered\r\nby his father. But the czar himself lamented his son and afterwards\r\nshowed Boris even greater favour for his boldness, which nevertheless\r\ncost him some months’ illness. But towards the end of his life Ivan,\r\nunder the influence of other favourites, began to look askance at Boris,\r\nand perhaps things might have gone badly with Godunov had not Ivan died\r\nsuddenly.\r\n\r\nAfter Ivan’s death Boris found himself in a position such as had\r\nnever before been occupied by a subject in the empire of Moscow. The\r\nfeeble-minded Feodor had become czar, and as he could not in any case\r\nhave ruled himself, he was obliged to give up his power to that one among\r\nhis immediate entourage who proved himself the most capable and crafty.\r\nSuch a one in the court circles of that time was Boris. At the time of\r\nIvan’s death he was thirty-two years of age; of a handsome presence,\r\ndistinguished for his remarkable gift of speech, intelligent, prudent,\r\nbut egotistical to a high degree. All his activity was directed to the\r\nserving of his own interests, to his enrichment, to the increase of his\r\npower, to the exaltation of his family. He understood how to wait, to\r\ntake advantage of propitious moments, to remain in the shade or advance\r\nto the front when either manœuvre seemed opportune, to put on the mask\r\nof piety and of every virtue, to show kindness and mercy, and where it\r\nwas necessary severity and harshness. Ever deliberate, he never gave\r\nway to enthusiastic impulses and always acted with reflection. Like all\r\nsuch characters, he was ready to do good if good did not stand in the\r\nway of his personal interests; neither did he stop at any wickedness or\r\ncrime if he considered it necessary for the furtherance of his personal\r\nadvantages, and least of all when it was a question of personal safety.\r\n\r\nThere was nothing creative in his nature. He was incapable of becoming\r\nthe propagator of any idea or the guide of men into new pathways;\r\negotistical natures are not fitted for such tasks. As regent of the state\r\nhe was not far-seeing, but only apprehended proximate circumstances,\r\nand could only take advantage of them for close and pre-eminently\r\nself-centered aims. The lack of a good education still further narrowed\r\nthe horizon of his vision, although his strong common sense enabled him\r\nto understand the profitableness of acquaintance with the west for the\r\nfurtherance of his power. All the good of which his mind was capable\r\nwas frustrated by his narrow egotism and the extraordinary mendacity\r\nthat penetrated his whole being and was reflected in all his actions.\r\nThis last quality, however, had become a distinguishing characteristic\r\nof the people of Moscow at that period. The seeds of this vice had long\r\nexisted, but they were in a very great measure fostered and developed by\r\nthe reign of Ivan the Terrible, who was himself falsehood personified.\r\nBy creating the _opritchniki_ Ivan had armed the Russians against one\r\nanother, and taught them to look for favour or safety in the ruin of\r\ntheir neighbours; by punishments and executions for imaginary crimes, he\r\nhad taught them to give false information; and by perpetrating the most\r\ninhuman villanies for pure diversion, he had educated those around him in\r\nheartlessness and cruelty. Respect for right and morality vanished after\r\nthe czar, who according to the national ideal should be the guardian of\r\nboth, had organised before the eyes of his subjects such spectacles as\r\nthe baiting of innocent persons by bears or the public torture of naked\r\ngirls, while at the same time he observed the strictest rules of monastic\r\npiety. In moments of personal danger everyone naturally thinks only of\r\nhimself; but when such moments were prolonged for Russians into decades,\r\nit is comprehensible that a generation of self-seeking and hard-hearted\r\negotists must have arisen, whose whole thought and aspiration were\r\ndirected to the preservation of their own safety--a generation for whom,\r\nin spite of the outward observance of the customary forms of piety,\r\nlawfulness, and morality, there remained no inward righteousness. He who\r\nwas clever beyond the average, was bound to become a model of falsity;\r\nit was an epoch when the mind, rivetted in the narrow fetters of the\r\nself-interested motives inherent in the whole contemporary sphere of\r\nexistence, could only show its activity in the attainment of its personal\r\naims by means of deceit. Desperate diseases of human society, like\r\nphysical illnesses, are not quickly cured when the general conditions\r\nof life contribute not to the cessation but rather to the prolongation\r\nof the unhealthy state; the terrible phenomena of the “troubled times”\r\ncan be explained only as the outbreaking of the hidden corruptions\r\naccumulated during the awful period of the tyranny of Ivan the Terrible.\r\n\r\nThe mendacity which constituted a feature of the period is powerfully\r\nreflected in the contemporary Russian sources of information, and it\r\nwould be easy to fall into error and inaccurate inferences if we were\r\nto trust to them and accept their guidance; fortunately the evident\r\ncontradictions and absurdities into which they fall sufficiently testify\r\nto their untruthfulness.[c]\r\n\r\n\r\nWAR WITH SWEDEN\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [1590 A.D.]]\r\n\r\nRussia boasted of her power, having in reality the largest army in\r\nEurope, yet a part of old Russia was in Sweden’s power. The peace\r\nconcluded with King John expired at the beginning of the year 1590. The\r\nsecond interview with the ambassadors on the borders of the Plusa was\r\nfruitless, the Swedes having refused to restore their conquests. Under\r\nsuch circumstances no understanding could be arrived at. Sweden proposed\r\na mere exchange, giving up Koporie for Sumersk on the banks of the Neva.\r\nJohn complained that the Russians annoyed Finland by incursions, ravaging\r\nthe land like tigers. Feodor reproached the voyevods for their brigandage\r\nin the Zaonega, Olonetz, Ladoga, and Dvina countries. During the summer\r\nof 1589 they came from Caianie to pillage the lands belonging to the\r\nconvents of Sklovetzk, Petchensk, Kola, Kereta, and Kovda, seizing as\r\nbooty more than half a million of silver roubles in cash. In engaging\r\nthe king to make concessions, the czar spoke to him of his great allies,\r\nthe emperor and the shah. But John answered ironically: “I am delighted\r\nto see you now know your weakness and wait for help from others. We\r\nshall see what kind of aid our relation Rudolph will give you. As for\r\nourselves, we do not need allies to finish you off.” Notwithstanding this\r\ninsolence, John asked for a third interview with the ambassadors. But\r\nFeodor declared to him that neither peace nor a truce was wanted unless\r\nthe Swedes would yield, besides the lands belonging to Novgorod which\r\nthey had invaded, Revel and all Esthonia. In short, Russia declared war.\r\n\r\nUp to that time, Godunov had only shone by his genius in interior and\r\nexterior politics. Always prudent and inclined to peace, not warlike nor\r\naspiring to glory through arms, he yet wished to prove that his love of\r\npeace did not arise from cowardice on this occasion when, without being\r\nashamed or failing in the sacred use of power, bloodshed could not be\r\navoided. To fulfil this duty he employed every means necessary to ensure\r\nsuccess. He put on the field (if one can credit official documents of the\r\ntime) nearly three hundred thousand fighters, infantry and cavalry, with\r\nthree hundred pieces of artillery. All the boyars, all the czarevitches\r\n(Muhammed, Koul of Siberia, Rouslanei son of Kaiboula, and Ouraze Magmet\r\nof the Kirghiz), the voyevods of countries near and far, towns and\r\nhamlets where they lived in quiet, were obliged to be at a certain time\r\nunder the royal flag; for the pacific Feodor, having left--not without\r\nregret--his religious occupations, himself headed his army. This was just\r\nwhat Godunov needed to animate the troops and hinder senseless disputes\r\namong the principal dignitaries concerning ancient lineage and precedence.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ESTHONIAN GIRL]\r\n\r\nPrince Feodor Mstislavski commanded the grand army; the advance guard\r\nwas under Prince Dmitri Khvorostinin, a voyevod distinguished for\r\ntalent and courage. Godunov and Feodor Romanov-Turiev (descended from\r\nthe illustrious Philarete), the czar’s second cousin, were combined\r\nwith him under the title court voyevods. The czarina Irene followed\r\nher husband from Moscow as far as Novgorod, where the monarch assigned\r\nthe destination of the troops. He ordered some to march to Flanders\r\nbeyond the Neva; others to Esthonia as far as the coast; he himself at\r\nthe head of the principal army set out on the 18th of January, 1590,\r\nagainst Narva. It was a hard campaign on account of the severe cold,\r\nbut distinguished by the zeal of the troops. The Russians marched to\r\nretake what was theirs, and, on the 27th of January, seized Jama. Twenty\r\nthousand Swedes, as many cavalry as infantry, commanded by Gustav Banér,\r\nmet Prince Dmitri Khvorostinin near Narva, but were defeated and driven\r\nback into the town, which was full of people but destitute of provisions.\r\nThat was why Banér, having left the necessary number of soldiers in the\r\nfortress, fled during the night and went to Vesemberg, pursued by the\r\nRussian Asiatic cavalry, and left all his baggage and artillery. Among\r\nthe prisoners were several Swedes of distinction.\r\n\r\nOn the 4th of February the Russians besieged Narva, and having managed\r\nby a vigourous bombardment to make three breaches demanded a submission.\r\nThe commander, Charles Horn, called them on to the assault and valiantly\r\nrepulsed the enemy. The voyevods Saburov and Prince Ivan Tokmakov, as\r\nwell as certain boyar children, Strelitz, and Mordiren, and Tcherckess\r\nwomen and soldiers perished in the breach. Nevertheless, this affair,\r\nhowever brilliant for the Swedes, could not save the town: the cannonade\r\ndid not cease; walls were tottering and the Russian troops prepared\r\nfor a new assault on the 21st of February. Even at this epoch the\r\nRussians ravaged Esthonia without opposition as far as Revel, and in\r\nFinland as far as the Åbo, for King John had more pride than forces.\r\nThen negotiations were opened. Russia demanded Narva and all Esthonia\r\nin return for peace from the Swedes; but the czar, “yielding to the\r\nChristian insistence of Godunov,” as it is said in official documents,\r\ncontented himself with re-establishing the former frontier.\r\n\r\nOn the 22nd of February Horn, in the king’s name, concluded a peace for\r\none year, yielding the czar Jama, Ivangorod, and Koporie, with all stores\r\nand war ammunition. It was agreed to fix the fate of Esthonia at a nearby\r\nmeeting of Russians and Swedes, by promising to yield to Russia even\r\nKarelia, Narva, and other Esthonian towns. Russia gained in glory by her\r\nmoderation. Feodor, after leaving the voyevods in the three fortresses\r\ntaken, hastened to return to Novgorod and his wife, and go thence with\r\nher to Moscow to celebrate a victory over those same European powers with\r\nwhich his father, doubtful of his military skill, had warned him not\r\nto engage. The clergy, headed by the cross, came to meet the sovereign\r\noutside the town; and the metropolitan, Job, in a pompous discourse\r\ncompared him to Constantine the Great and Vladimir, according him thanks\r\nin the name of country and church for having driven the infidels from the\r\nheart of Holy Russia, also for having re-established the altars of the\r\ntrue God in the town of Ivan III and in the old Slav possessions of Ilmen.\r\n\r\nSoon Swedish perfidy gave new and important success to the arms of the\r\npacific Feodor. King John, accusing Horn of cowardice, declared that the\r\nconvention signed by him was incriminating. He reinforced his troops in\r\nEsthonia, and sent two seigneurs, lieutenants from Upsala and Vestergöt,\r\nto the mouths of the Plusa, there to have an interview with Prince Feodor\r\nMstislavski and a member of the Pissemski council, not to give Esthonia\r\nto Russia, but to exact that Jama, Ivangorod, and Koporie should be\r\nreturned. At this news not only Feodor’s ambassadors but even the Swiss\r\nsoldiers showed their discontent. Ranged on the other side of the Plusa\r\nthey called on the Russians, but Russia desired no more slaughter, and\r\nthey forced their plenipotentiaries to forego their pretentions, so that\r\nnothing but peace was sought and they ended by consenting to yield all\r\nKarelia to Russia. But she insisted on having Narva, and the ambassadors\r\nseparated.\r\n\r\nThat same night the Swiss general, Joran Boyé, treacherously besieged\r\nIvangorod whilst the terms of the Narva convention had not yet expired.\r\nBut the intrepid voyevod Ivan Saburov completely defeated by a vigourous\r\nsortie not only General Boyé but the duke of Sudermania joined with him.\r\nThe principal Moscow army was at Novgorod but was not in time to help.\r\nThey found the fortress already delivered and saw only from a distance\r\nthe enemy fleeing.[d]\r\n\r\n\r\nSERFDOM\r\n\r\nIt was Boris Godunov, to whom his contemporaries give the title\r\nLieutenant of the Empire, who in reality introduced into it the\r\nattachment of serfs to the soil. Up till then the peasants, using and\r\nabusing the faculty of passing from one estate to another, had changed\r\nmasters on every occasion; and many were the inconveniences which\r\nresulted, notably this that they accustomed themselves to no given\r\nsituation with its climate, men, and accessories, were not attached\r\nto the ground, and remained strangers to the locality they inhabited.\r\nBoris was besieged with the landowners’ complaints on this subject, and\r\nsaw, besides, that the cultivators themselves, frequently deceived in\r\ntheir hope of finding a better landlord, would then abandon themselves\r\nto discouragement; and this engendered poverty, increased the number of\r\nvagabonds and the lowest classes, and caused numerous habitations, well\r\nsuited to shelter field-labourers, to be deserted, become dilapidated,\r\nand fall into ruin. Boris had favoured agriculture by releasing the\r\npeasants on the czar’s estates, and perhaps those on his own, from the\r\ntax. His intentions were doubtless benevolent: his aim was to unite\r\nthe labourers and the landlords as by a family tie, and to augment\r\nthe well-being of both, by establishing between them an indissoluble\r\ncommunity of interest to their mutual advantage. It was in this hope that\r\nhe instituted the law of 1592 or 1593, by which the peasant’s undisputed\r\nright to liberty of removal (_vykhod_) was suppressed.\r\n\r\nWe may, however, believe that Boris had still another motive. In a\r\ncountry of the extent of Russia and administered as she was, the\r\ngovernment had some difficulty in keeping up direct relations with\r\nthe peasants who were bound to pay it the tax and to provide for the\r\nrecruiting of the army, which had recently been transformed like the\r\nrest. The government was then very glad to avail itself of the nobles as\r\nintermediaries and enlightened executors of its orders. Consequently it\r\nmade them its delegates for the administration and police, an arrangement\r\nwhich simplified the machinery; and the nobles, acting in their own most\r\napparent interests, must have afterwards pushed matters to extremes.\r\nHowever that may be, the peasants were now inscribed in review books\r\nand forbidden to go away from their commune except by the authority of\r\ntheir lord. In spite of the discontent which this measure produced, it\r\nwas further strengthened by the ukase of the 21st of November, 1597,\r\nrelative to fugitive peasants, of which there were a great number in\r\nconsequence of these legal prescriptions, so evidently contrary to the\r\ntemperament and genius of the nations. Those who had hired themselves out\r\nfor a certain time were forbidden to redeem themselves from the effects\r\nof this new _régime_, even by reimbursing the sum stipulated as the price\r\nof hire. What was more, these peasants who had disposed of their persons\r\nby contract were not the only ones affected by these laws of oppression:\r\nthey touched even the freemen who, without having signed any engagement,\r\nhappened to be in the service of the landlords. If they had been there\r\nfor more than three months, they were obliged to remain permanently, and\r\nwhere their time of service was not so long all they gained was the power\r\nof choosing between the last lord and another, but always renouncing the\r\nright of being their own masters. A new ukase ordained that all boyars,\r\nprinces, nobles, the military and legal classes, etc., should present, on\r\naccount of the individuals in their service, present or in the course of\r\nflight, their letters of serfdom, in order to have them inscribed in the\r\nregisters of the chamber for the regulation of serfs.\r\n\r\nThe measure once taken, Godunov, who wished to be agreeable to the\r\nmass of the rural proprietors, gave it all the extension possible;\r\nstill, at the same time he declared the emancipated to be free forever,\r\nas well as their wives and their children; this last, however, was a\r\nvery feeble amelioration of an evidently iniquitous law, which did not\r\nfail to produce extreme indignation in the whole rural population. In\r\nvarious places the peasants protested by flight against the tyranny\r\nexercised over them by a power whose despotism had never gone so far.\r\nWant was doubtless not long in bringing the greater part back to their\r\nabandoned homes, or they were constrained to return by armed force; but\r\nSt. George’s day, the date when this law of enslavement was put into\r\nexecution, was graven in their memories as a day of ill-omen; the people\r\nhave never pardoned it for its disgrace and will perhaps continue to\r\ncurse it, although the day of reparation is come at last. But the peasant\r\nwas not the only one to suffer; the great number of men in flight gave\r\noccasion to a thousand ruinous suits between landowners; they accused\r\neach other of offering an asylum to the fugitives and of keeping them\r\nin concealment. The evil was so great, says the historian upon whose\r\nnarratives ours is based, that Boris, though unwilling to abolish a law\r\npassed from good motives, decided at least to declare that it should\r\nbe only temporary, and, by an ukase of the 21st of November, 1601, he\r\nauthorised the peasants of boyars’ children, and of other nobles of the\r\nsecondary classes, to return, within a fixed period, from one proprietor\r\nto another of the same rank; not more than two at a time, however, and\r\nexception being made of the Moscow district. On the other hand, he\r\nordered the peasants belonging to the boyars and other great nobles, and\r\nthose of the crown, the bishoprics, and the convents, not to stir during\r\nthis same year 1601, but to remain in their respective habitations.\r\nKaramzin adds that the sensation produced by all this was such that\r\nBoris was personally affected by it. It is asserted, he says, that the\r\nabolition of the old _régime_ and the uncertainty of the new, a source\r\nof discontent to so many, exercised a great influence over the fate of\r\nthe unfortunate Godunov. In the end he seems to have left the matter\r\nin suspense, and it was Prince Chuïski who, raised to the throne under\r\nthe name of Vasili (V) Ivanovitch, consummated the social revolution\r\nwe are speaking of, by his ukase of the 9th of March, 1607, confirming\r\nthat of 1593 and, in addition, laying down the penalties to be inflicted\r\non whoever should give asylum to the fugitives. The lot was cast--the\r\npeasant had lapsed into a serf attached to the soil.[e]\r\n\r\n\r\nDEATH OF DMITRI (1591 A.D.)\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [1591 A.D.]]\r\n\r\nBoris desired above all things to be feared, but he did not disdain a\r\ncertain amount of popularity for his family; and he left no means untried\r\nto render his sister Irene dear to the Russian people. All rigorous\r\nmeasures were executed in the name of the czar, and by order of the\r\nregent; but acts of clemency and favours of every kind were ascribed to\r\nthe intercession of the czarina Irene, who, indeed, was always a docile\r\ninstrument in the hands of her brother. She acted and thought only in\r\nobedience to his inspirations, blending with great simplicity of heart\r\nher respect and admiration of Boris with the passionate love which she\r\nfelt for Feodor.\r\n\r\nThe intimidated boyars were reduced to silence. Dmitri, still a child,\r\ncould cause no apprehension; but his mother, the czarina-dowager, Maria\r\nFeodorovna, and his three uncles, Michael, Gregory, and Andrew Nagoi,\r\nmight perhaps attempt to avail themselves of their alliance with the\r\nreigning family. Boris therefore banished them to the town of Uglitch,\r\nwhich had been assigned as an appanage to young Dmitri by the will of\r\nIvan; and, under the pretext of intrusting them with the education of the\r\nczarevitch, he kept them there in a kind of exile.\r\n\r\nAt Uglitch, in 1591, Dmitri, at ten years of age, had his little\r\ncourt--his _jiltsy_ (children brought up with the young princes), and\r\nhis great officers, among whom the regent had doubtless introduced\r\nmany a spy. The pensions of the young prince and his family were paid\r\nand controlled by a _deak_, or secretary of chancery, named Michael\r\nBitiagovski, a creature of Boris; and between this functionary and\r\nthe Nagoi there naturally arose frequent discussions, which increased\r\nin bitterness from day to day. Strong in the authority with which the\r\nregent had invested him, the secretary delighted to cavil at all the\r\npretensions of the family of the czarevitch. It seemed his constant aim,\r\nby the incessant renewal of petty vexations, to make them feel that their\r\nfortune had greatly declined since the death of Ivan the Terrible. To\r\nthe complaints which they laid before the czar, Bitiagovski replied by\r\ndenouncing any imprudent expressions that might have escaped from the\r\nNagoi during their exile. If we may believe the report of the secretary\r\nof chancery, the czarevitch already exhibited the ferocious instincts and\r\ncruel tastes of his father. He took pleasure in nothing, it was said, but\r\nin seeing animals beaten, or else in mutilating them with a refinement of\r\nbarbarity. It is related that, one winter’s day, when playing with some\r\nchildren of his own age, he constructed several figures of men out of the\r\nsnow in the courtyard of his palace. To each of these he gave the name of\r\none of the great functionaries of the empire; and the largest of all he\r\ncalled Boris. Then seizing a wooden sabre, he knocked off either their\r\narms or their heads. “When I am a man,” said the child, “that is how I\r\nwill treat them.” These and similar anecdotes were carefully collected\r\nand commented upon at Moscow. Perhaps they may have been invented by\r\nthe agents of Boris, in order to render the Nagoi odious to the Russian\r\nnobility; or perhaps, educated as he was by servants and courtiers in\r\ndisgrace, the young prince repeated only too faithfully the lessons which\r\nhe was taught.\r\n\r\nThe hopes and fears occasioned by his education were, however, speedily\r\ndissipated by the sudden death of Dmitri. His end was strange, and it\r\nis difficult to say whether it was the result of an accident or of a\r\ncrime. On the 15th of May, 1591, the czarevitch, whom his mother had just\r\nleft for a moment, was amusing himself with four children, his pages or\r\n_jiltsy_, in the courtyard of his palace--a spacious enclosure which\r\ncontained several separate dwelling houses, built irregularly in various\r\nparts. He was still attended by Vasilissa Volokhov his governess, his\r\nnurse, and a chambermaid. It is probable that they may have lost sight\r\nof him for a moment. According to the unanimous testimony of the three\r\nwomen and of the pages, he was holding a knife, which he was amusing\r\nhimself by sticking into the ground, or with which he was cutting a piece\r\nof wood. On a sudden, the nurse looked around, and saw him weltering in\r\nhis blood. He had a large wound in his throat, and he expired without\r\nuttering a word. On hearing the cries of the nurse, the czarina ran up,\r\nand in the first transports of her despair exclaimed that her son had\r\nbeen assassinated. She flew upon the governess, whose duty it was to\r\ntake care of him, and beat her furiously with a heavy stick, accusing\r\nher of having admitted the murderers who had just slain her son. At the\r\nsame time, as her thoughts doubtless turned to her recent quarrels with\r\nBitiagovski, she invoked upon that man the vengeance of her brothers and\r\nof the servants of her household.\r\n\r\nMichael Nagoi now came up, having just left the dinner table, in a state\r\nof intoxication, according to the testimony of several witnesses; in his\r\nturn he began to beat the poor governess, and ordered that the alarm bell\r\nshould be rung at the church of the Saviour, which stood near the palace.\r\nIn an instant the courtyard was filled with inhabitants of Uglitch and\r\ndomestics, who ran up with pitchforks and hatchets, believing that the\r\npalace of the czarevitch was on fire. With them arrived Bitiagovski,\r\naccompanied by his son and by the gentlemen employed in his chancery. He\r\nendeavoured to speak, to appease the tumult, and cried out at once that\r\nthe child had killed himself by falling on his knife in an epileptic\r\nfit, from which it was well known that he frequently suffered. “Behold\r\nthe murderer!” exclaimed the czarina. A hundred arms were immediately\r\nraised to strike him. He fled into one of the houses in the enclosure,\r\nand barricaded the door; but it was soon burst open, and he was cut to\r\npieces. His son was slain at the same time. Whoever raised his voice in\r\nhis defence, whoever was known to be connected with him, was immediately\r\nstruck down and put to death. The governess Vasilissa, covered with blood\r\nand half-killed by the blows she had received, lay on the ground near the\r\nczarina, bareheaded, and with dishevelled hair; for the servants of the\r\nNagoi had taken off her cap--which was considered by the Russians, at\r\nthis period, a more infamous outrage even than blows. One of her serfs,\r\ncompassionating her disgrace, picked up her cap, and replaced it on her\r\nhead; he was instantly massacred. The furious crowd, still pursuing\r\nand murdering those who were pointed out to its vengeance, carried the\r\nbleeding body of the czarevitch into the church. Thither they dragged\r\nDaniel Volokhov, the son of the governess, who was known to be intimate\r\nwith Bitiagovski. This was enough to procure his condemnation as an\r\naccomplice in the crime; and he was immediately put to death before the\r\neyes of his mother, in front of the body of the young prince. It was\r\nwith great difficulty that the priests of the church of the Saviour\r\nrescued Vasilissa and the daughters of Bitiagovski from the hands of the\r\nmultitude. All these women, however, were shut up in one of the buildings\r\nadjoining the cathedral; and guards were placed at all the approaches.[b]\r\n\r\nPublic opinion denounced Boris, and in order to quiet the people he\r\nordered an investigation. His emissaries had the audacity to declare that\r\nthe young prince, in an access of folly, had cut his own throat, and that\r\nthe Nagoi and the people of Uglitch had killed, as murderers, men who\r\nwere innocent. The result of this policy was the extermination of the\r\nNagoi and the depopulation of Uglitch.\r\n\r\nSeven years afterward the pious Feodor died: in the person of this pale\r\nand virtuous sovereign ended the violent and sanguinary race of men\r\nof prey who had made Russia. The dynasty, issue of André Bogoliubski,\r\nhad accomplished its mission--it had founded a united Russia. The task\r\nof bringing into the heart of Europe this semi-Asiatic country was to\r\ndevolve on another dynasty.[f]\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE REIGN OF BORIS (1598-1605 A.D.)\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [1598 A.D.]]\r\n\r\nIn 1598 Boris Godunov, by the voice of the electors and through the\r\nintrigues of his friends, ascended the throne of Russia. A crown\r\nobtained by indirect and fraudulent measures could not be preserved\r\nwithout tyranny. Boris, conscious of the jealousies which his elevation\r\nengendered in the minds of the nobles, and especially in the family of\r\nthe Romanovs, who were allied to the race of Rurik but not to the Moscow\r\nline, was constantly haunted by apprehensions, and sought to lose them in\r\nthe revel, and to propitiate them by the sacrifice of all persons whom\r\nhe suspected. Had he been a legitimate sovereign he would have conferred\r\nlasting benefits upon his country, because he was a wise and paternal\r\nruler in all matters apart from his personal affairs. He bestowed\r\nconsiderable pains on many laudable measures of improvement; but these\r\nwere so sullied by acts of merciless revenge, to which he was moved by\r\nthe danger in which he was placed by his usurpation, that it is difficult\r\nto separate his merits from his crimes.\r\n\r\nThe Tatars of the Crimea, immediately after Boris was proclaimed czar,\r\nexhibited a disposition to renew their old hostilities; but Boris\r\npromptly turned his attention to that part of the empire, and, assembling\r\na numerous army, availed himself of the opportunity of ingratiating\r\nhimself with the troops. The descent of the Tatars was merely an idle\r\nthreat; but the occasion was one which contributed considerably to\r\nenlarge the popularity of Boris. He exceeded all his predecessors in the\r\nsplendour and hospitality of his entertainments, in the frequency of the\r\namusements which he provided for the soldiery and the citizens, and the\r\ngeneral amenity and condescension of his bearing in public. It seems to\r\nhave been the policy of the tyrants of Russia to conciliate the lower\r\norders, in order that they might, with the greater facility, crush the\r\naristocracy, from whom they chiefly dreaded opposition; and Boris was\r\neminently successful in his attempts to ensnare the affections of the\r\nmultitude, although he had actually deprived them of the only fragment of\r\nliberty they possessed.\r\n\r\nIn the commencement of his reign he evinced a strong desire to cultivate\r\nthe friendship of the different powers of Europe, from whom severally\r\nhe received ambassadors at his court; to extend to all his subjects in\r\ncommon the means of procuring cheap and rapid justice, in the fulfilment\r\nof which he gave audiences for the purpose of receiving and redressing\r\ncomplaints; and to diffuse abroad a taste for European knowledge and\r\ninstruction in those arts and sciences which had hitherto been neglected\r\nand despised. In some of these wise projects he met great resistance from\r\nthe clergy, who, released from the presence of a sovereign who ruled them\r\nby a mission from heaven, began to exhibit uneasiness and impatience\r\nof control. Thus constantly thrown back upon the uncertain tenure of\r\nhis power, and reminded that he was not a legitimate master, Boris was\r\nforced to exert arbitrary and unjust means to maintain his authority.\r\nThe current of the official and privileged classes was running against\r\nhim, and he was compelled to erect such defences as the necessities of\r\nthe occasion required. But even out of this difficulty he contrived to\r\nextract some benefits for the country.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BORIS GODUNOV, IN RETIREMENT AT THE MONASTERY, INTREATED\r\nTO ACCEPT HIS ELECTION AS CZAR\r\n\r\n(Painted for the HISTORIANS’ HISTORY OF THE WORLD by Thure de Thulstrup)]\r\n\r\nFor three years a famine fell upon Russia, paralysing the efforts of\r\nindustry, and spreading misery and distress over the whole empire.\r\nThroughout the whole of this calamitous period, Boris incessantly\r\nemployed himself in devising modes of relief, and levying from the\r\nsurplus funds of the rich a treasury of alms to alleviate the wants of\r\nthe poor. Out of his own abundant coffers he daily distributed several\r\nthousand rubles, and he forced the nobility and the clergy, who, with\r\na grasping avariciousness, kept aloof from the miseries that surrounded\r\nthem, to open their granaries, and to sell him their stores of corn\r\nat half price, that he might distribute it gratuitously amongst the\r\nimpoverished people. These exactions depressed the wealthy, and won the\r\ngratitude of the needy; but still they were insufficient to meet the\r\nwhole demand of poverty. Great numbers died, and Boris, unable to provide\r\nsustenance for them while living, caused them to be buried with respect,\r\nfurnishing to each corpse a suit of linen grave-clothes.\r\n\r\nThese benevolent exertions of Boris were viewed with distrust and malice\r\nby the nobility, who clearly enough discerned the policy that lay at the\r\nbottom. Their murmurs arose in private, and gradually assumed a sterner\r\nexpression in public. At the feasts, and even in the court itself,\r\nthe signs and words of disaffection could not be misunderstood. The\r\ninsecurity of his position urged Boris to protect himself by a machinery\r\nof terror. Into a small space of time he crowded a number of executions,\r\nand consigned several of the discontented grandees to imprisonment and\r\nexile. His alarm magnified his danger, and supplied him with expedients\r\nof cruelty. At his own banquets he did not hesitate to rise up and\r\ndenounce particular individuals, who were immediately seized upon by his\r\nadherents, and either put to death or cast into dungeons, or banished,\r\nand their properties confiscated to the state. Despotism penetrated to\r\nall classes; the peasantry, bound to the soil, were further oppressed by\r\npenal laws.\r\n\r\nAmongst other sanguinary provisions, it was enacted that all the\r\nindividuals of a family were held to be involved in the punishment of\r\na single member. It was also declared that every Russian who passed\r\nbeyond the frontiers was a rebel to his country and a heretic. A father\r\nwas invested with all the powers of a despot in his hut, and allowed to\r\ninflict summary punishment upon his wife and children, the latter of whom\r\nhe was permitted to sell four times; and this regulation was annulled\r\nonly by the bondage to the fief, which substituted a worse tyranny for\r\nthe domestic slavery. The merciless rule of Boris may be regarded as\r\nthe consequence of his situation, which exposed him to hazards from\r\nwhich he could not escape except by some such decisive and terrible\r\nmeasures. The iron sway pressed down the expiring spirit of licentious\r\nfreedom. The wandering minstrels who had hitherto travelled through the\r\ncountry, perpetuating in their songs the historical glories of Russia,\r\nand inspiring the people with proud sentiments of national emulation,\r\ndisappeared. The metrical chronicles perished in the general dismay.\r\nThe immediate result of this struggle to preserve the object of his\r\nguilty ambition was an extensive emigration of the peasantry, who fled\r\nfrom the scene of misery to embrace the wild freedom of the Cossacks or\r\nseek protection from the king of Poland; and an atrocious _jacquerie_\r\nsucceeded, which was, for a short time, triumphant.[g]\r\n\r\nNever had the government of Boris met with fewer obstacles; never had\r\nthe authority of a czar appeared more firmly established. At peace with\r\nforeign powers, and quietly watching the conflicts of his neighbours,\r\nhe applied himself to the task of civilising his people, of encouraging\r\ncommerce, and of establishing an exact system of police in all the\r\nprovinces of his empire. Every one of his acts was received with\r\nsubmission and executed with alacrity; but, nevertheless, all minds were\r\nagitated by a secret disquietude. The czar could not conceal from himself\r\nthe aversion with which he was regarded by the Russians; all classes,\r\nnobles and serfs, alike detested him. He saw all his intentions, all his\r\ndecrees interpreted as violations of the laws of the country. At this\r\nperiod of benighted ignorance the Russians, even of the higher classes,\r\nregarded foreigners with a kind of superstitious horror. They made no\r\ndifference between a foreigner and an infidel, and applied the name of\r\n“pagan” indiscriminately to the idolatrous Tcheremiss, the Mussulman\r\nTatar, and the Lutheran or Catholic German. Love of their country, or,\r\nto speak more correctly, of their native soil, was confounded by them\r\nwith their attachment to their national religion. They called themselves\r\nthe “orthodox people,” and their country Holy Russia. Elsewhere than\r\nin that privileged land it was impossible, they believed, to obtain\r\nsalvation. The early troubles of the Reformation in Germany had brought\r\ninto Russia a large number of poor adventurers, who had sought to turn\r\ntheir superior knowledge to account. The people were not slow to perceive\r\nthe pre-eminence of these foreigners in the arts and industry, but they\r\nonly detested them the more on this account. The Germans were continually\r\ncharged by the vulgar herd with a desire to corrupt the national faith,\r\nand to appropriate to themselves the wealth of the country. Boris,\r\nindeed, flattered them and invited them into his dominions, feeling\r\nthat he had need of them to guide his subjects towards a higher stage\r\nof civilisation. But the commercial privileges and facilities which he\r\ngranted to Livonian and German merchants only served as a pretext to the\r\nmost terrible accusation which could be brought against a sovereign--that\r\nof betraying his country and his religion. He sent eighteen young\r\ngentlemen to study in Germany, France, and England; their families\r\nlamented them as doomed victims. On either side of the frontier all\r\ncontact with foreigners was deemed a pollution.[b]\r\n\r\n\r\n_The False Dmitri Appears_\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [1603 A.D.]]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A FEMALE OSTIAK]\r\n\r\nSuddenly, a surprising rumour was brought from the frontiers of\r\nLithuania, and spread with incredible rapidity through all the provinces\r\nof the empire. The czarevitch Dmitri, who was believed to have been\r\nassassinated at Uglitch, was still living in Poland. Having been\r\nfavourably received by a palatine, he had made himself known to the\r\nprincipal nobles of the republic, and was preparing to reclaim his\r\nhereditary throne. It was related that he had wandered for some time\r\nin Russia, concealed beneath the frock of a monk. The archimandrite of\r\nthe convent of the Saviour at Novgorod Seversk had given him a lodging\r\nwithout recognising him. The prince had proceeded thence to Kiev, leaving\r\nin his cell a note, in which he declared that he was Dmitri, the son of\r\nIvan the Terrible, and that he would one day recompense the hospitality\r\nof the archimandrite. On the other hand it was stated that the persons\r\nworthy of belief had seen the czarevitch among the Zaparogian Cossacks,\r\ntaking part in their military expeditions and distinguishing himself\r\nby his courage and address in all warlike exercises. The name of the\r\nataman under whose orders he had enrolled himself was also given. Other\r\nauthorities declared that they had seen the same person at the same time\r\nstudying Latin at Huszcza, a small town in Volhinia. Though reports were\r\ncontradictory as to details, they all agreed on this one point--that\r\nDmitri was still living, and that he intended to call the usurper to\r\naccount for all his crimes.[b]\r\n\r\nWho was the personage whom the Russian historians have called the “false\r\nDmitri.” Was he really the son of Ivan the Terrible, saved by the\r\nforesight of the Nogai from the assassins’ knife and replaced in the\r\ncoffin, as he related, by the son of a pope (Russian parish priest)?\r\nWas he, as the czar and the patriarch proclaimed him, a certain Gregori\r\nOtrepiev, a vagabond monk who was for a time secretary to the patriarch\r\nJob and was thus enabled to surprise state secrets--who in his nomadic\r\nlife afterwards appeared amongst the Zaparogians, where he is said to\r\nhave become an accomplished rider and an intrepid Cossack? To all these\r\nquestions, in the present state of our information, no absolutely certain\r\nanswer can be given. Kostomarov compared the handwriting of the pretender\r\nwith that of the monk Otrepiev and affirms that they do not resemble each\r\nother. Captain Margeret knew people who conversed with Otrepiev after the\r\npretender’s death. Not to prejudge the solution we will give this last\r\nnot the name of Dmitri but that of Demetrius, with which he signed his\r\nletters to the pope.\r\n\r\nAbout the year 1603 a young man entered the service of the Polish _pan_,\r\nAdam Vichnevetski. He fell or feigned to fall ill, sent for a Catholic\r\npriest, and under the seal of professional secrecy revealed to him\r\nthat he was the czarevitch Dmitri, who had escaped from the assassins\r\nof Uglitch. He showed, suspended from his neck, a cross enriched with\r\nprecious stones, which he asserted that he had received from Prince\r\nMstislavski, the godfather of Dmitri. The priest dared not keep such a\r\nsecret to himself. Demetrius was recognised by his master Vichnevetski as\r\nthe legitimate heir of Ivan the Terrible. Mniszek, palatine of Sandomir,\r\npromised him his help. Demetrius had already fallen in love with Marina,\r\nthe eldest daughter of Mniszek, and swore to make her czarina of Moscow;\r\nthe father and the young girl accepted the proposal of marriage.\r\n\r\nMeantime the strange tidings of the resuscitation of Dmitri spread\r\nthrough the whole kingdom of Poland. Mniszek and Vichnevetski conducted\r\nDemetrius to Cracow and presented him to the king. The papal nuncio\r\ninterested himself in his behalf; the Jesuits and Franciscans worked in\r\nconcert for his conversion; in secret he abjured orthodoxy and promised\r\nto bring Moscow within the pale of the Roman church. He corresponded with\r\nClement VIII whose least servant, _infimus cliens_, he declared himself\r\nto be. Thus he was recognised by the king, the nuncio, the Jesuits, and\r\nthe pope. Did they really believe in his legitimacy? It is probable\r\nthat they saw in him a formidable instrument of disturbance; the king\r\nflattered himself that he would be able to turn it against Russia and\r\nthe Jesuits--that they might use it against orthodoxy. Sigismund dared\r\nnot take upon himself to break the truce concluded with Boris and expose\r\nhimself to Muscovite vengeance. He treated Demetrius as czarevitch, but\r\nonly in private; he refused to place the royal troops at his disposal,\r\nbut authorised the nobles who were touched by the misfortunes of the\r\nyoung prince to aid him as they might desire.\r\n\r\nThe pans had no need of a royal authorisation; many of them, with the\r\nlight-heartedness and love of adventure which characterised the Polish\r\nnobility, took arms.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [1604-1605 A.D.]]\r\n\r\nNo revolution, be it the wisest and most necessary, is accomplished\r\nwithout setting in motion the dregs of society, without coming into\r\ncollision with many interests and creating a multitude of outcasts. The\r\ntransformation then being accomplished in Russia for the creation of\r\nthe modern unitary state had awakened formidable elements of disorder.\r\nThe peasant, whom the laws of Boris had just attached to the glebe, was\r\neverywhere covertly hostile. The petty nobility, to whose profit this\r\ninnovation had been made, could only with great difficulty live by their\r\nestates: the czar’s service had become ruinous; many were inclined to\r\nmake up for the inadequacy of their revenues by brigandage. The boyars\r\nand the higher nobility were profoundly demoralised and were ready for\r\nany treason. The military republics of the Cossacks of the Don and\r\nDnieper, the bands of serfs or fugitive peasants which infested the\r\ncountry districts, were only waiting an opportunity to devastate Moscow.\r\nThe ignorance of the masses was profound, their minds greedy of marvels\r\nand of change: no nation has allowed itself to be so often captured by\r\nthe same fable--the sudden reappearance of a prince believed to be dead.\r\nThe archives of the secret chancery show us that there were in Russia,\r\nduring the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, hundreds of impostors,\r\nof false Dmitris, false Alexises, false Peters II, false Peters III. It\r\nmight be thought that the Russian people, the most Asiatic of European\r\npeoples, had not renounced the oriental dogma of reincarnations and\r\n_avatars_.\r\n\r\nSo long as power was in the hands of the skilful and energetic Godunov,\r\nhe succeeded in maintaining order, in restraining the fomenters of\r\ndisturbance, and in discouraging Demetrius. The patriarch Job, and Vasili\r\nShuiski, who had directed the inquiry at Uglitch, made proclamations\r\nto the people and affirmed that Dmitri was indeed dead and that the\r\npretender was no other than Otrepiev. Messengers were despatched bearing\r\nthe same affirmations to the king and the diet of Poland. Finally troops\r\nwere set on foot and a cordon was established along the western frontier.\r\nBut already the towns of Severia were agitated by the approach of the\r\nczarevitch; the boyars ventured to say publicly that it was “difficult to\r\nbear arms against a legitimate sovereign”; at Moscow the health of the\r\nczar Dmitri was drunk at festive gatherings. In October, 1604, Demetrius\r\ncrossed the frontier with a host of Poles, and banished Russians,\r\nGerman mercenaries, and Zaparogians. Severia immediately broke out into\r\ninsurrection, but Novgorod Seversk resisted. After Severia, the towns of\r\nUkraine joined in defection. Prince Mstislavski tried to arrest Demetrius\r\nby giving battle; but his soldiers were seized with the idea that the man\r\nagainst whom they were fighting was the real Dmitri. “They had no arms\r\nto strike with,” says Margeret. Twelve thousand Little-Russian Cossacks\r\nhastened to join the pretender’s standard. Vasili Shuiski, the successor\r\nof Mstislavski, did his best to restore their _morale_; this time\r\nDemetrius was vanquished at Dobrinitchi. Boris fancied that the war was\r\nended: it was only beginning. Four thousand Don Cossacks came to join the\r\nbrigand. The inaction of the Muscovite voyevods announced that the spirit\r\nof treason was gaining the higher nobility.\r\n\r\nIn 1605 Boris died, after recommending his innocent son to Basmanov, the\r\nboyars, the patriarch, and the people of Moscow. All took the oath to\r\nFeodor Borissovitch. But Basmanov had no sooner taken command of the army\r\nof Severia than he was in a position to convince himself that neither the\r\nsoldiers nor their leaders intended to fight for a Godunov. Rather than\r\nbe the victim of an act of treason he preferred to be its perpetrator;\r\nthe man in whom the dying Boris had placed all his confidence joined\r\nGalitzin and Soltikov, the secret partisans of Demetrius. He solemnly\r\nannounced to the troops that the latter was indeed the son of Ivan the\r\nTerrible and the legitimate master of Russia; he was the first to throw\r\nhimself at the feet of the pretender, who was immediately proclaimed by\r\nthe troops. Demetrius marched on Moscow. At his approach his partisans\r\nrose: the son and the wife of Godunov were massacred. Such was the\r\nsanguinary end of the dynasty which Boris had thought to found in the\r\nblood of a czarevitch.\r\n\r\nLet us bear in mind that in 1586 had appeared the narrative of Jean\r\nSauvage, sailor and merchant of Dieppe, who had come to reconnoitre the\r\nharbours of the White Sea and prepare the way for French traffic. The\r\nsame year the czar Feodor Ivanovitch sent to Henry III a Frenchman of\r\nMoscow, Pierre Ragon, to notify him of his accession; at Moscow appeared\r\nthe first ambassador sent there by France, François de Carle. In 1587 a\r\ncompany of Parisian merchants obtained a commercial charter from the same\r\nczar. Henry IV was in correspondence with the czars Feodor Ivanovitch and\r\nBoris.\r\n\r\n\r\nCAREER AND MURDER OF DEMETRIUS (1606 A.D.)\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [1606 A.D.]]\r\n\r\nWhat was now taking place in Russia is one of the most extraordinary\r\nevents of which the annals of the world make mention. An unknown man was\r\nmaking his triumphal entry into Moscow and the Kremlin (June 20th-30th).\r\nAll the people wept for joy, thinking they beheld the scion of so many\r\nprinces. One man alone dared to affirm that he had seen Dmitri murdered\r\nand that the new czar was an impostor; this was Vasili Shuiski, one of\r\nthose who had superintended the inquiry of Uglitch and who, at the battle\r\nof Dobrinitchi, had defeated the pretender. Denounced by Basmanov, he\r\nwas condemned to death by an assembly of the three orders. His head was\r\nalready on the block, when the czar sent an express bearing his pardon.\r\n\r\nThe son of the terrible czar was not recognisable in this act of mercy.\r\nLater on Demetrius was to repent of it. Job, the creature of Godunov, was\r\nreplaced in the patriarchate by a creature of the new prince, the Greek\r\nIgnatius. The czar had an interview with his pretended mother, Marie\r\nNagoi, the widow of Ivan IV: whether because she wished to complete the\r\nwork of an avenger, or because she was glad to recover all her honours,\r\nMarie recognised Demetrius as her son and publicly embraced him. He\r\nheaped favours on the Nagoi as his maternal relatives: the Romanovs also\r\nwere recalled from exile and Philaret was made metropolitan of Rostov.\r\n\r\nThe czar presided regularly at the douma; the boyars admired the\r\ncorrectness of his judgment and the variety of his knowledge. Demetrius\r\nwas a man of learning, brave and skilful in all bodily exercises. He was\r\nfond of foreigners and spoke of sending the Russian nobles to study in\r\nthe west. This taste for foreigners was not unaccompanied by a certain\r\ncontempt for the national ignorance and rudeness. He offended the boyars\r\nby his mockeries; he alienated the people and the clergy by his contempt\r\nfor Russian religious rites and usages. He ate veal, did not sleep after\r\ndinner, did not frequent the baths, borrowed money from the convents,\r\nturned the monks into ridicule, opposed the hunting with bears, paid\r\nfamiliar visits to foreign jewellers and artisans, took no heed of the\r\nstrict etiquette of the palace, himself pointed cannon, organised sham\r\nfights between the national and foreign troops, took pleasure in seeing\r\nthe Russians beaten by the Germans, surrounded himself with a European\r\nguard at the head of which were found men like Margeret, Knutzen, Van\r\nDennen. A conflict having broken out between the clergy and the pope’s\r\nlegate on the occasion of his entry into Moscow, two bishops were\r\nexiled. No one thanked him for resisting the pope and the king of Poland,\r\nrefusing to the one to occupy himself in the cause of the reunion of the\r\ntwo churches, declaring to the other that he would not yield an inch of\r\nRussian territory. The arrival of his wife, the Catholic Marina, with a\r\nsuite of Polish noblemen, who affected insolence towards the Russians,\r\ncompleted the irritation of the Muscovites. Less than a year after the\r\nentry of Demetrius [or as we may henceforth call him, Dmitri] into the\r\nKremlin, men’s minds were ripe for a revolution.[f]\r\n\r\n\r\n_The False Dmitri; Marriage and Death_\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to understand why, though as unscrupulous as most\r\nadventurers, Demetrius persisted in his determination to espouse a\r\nCatholic Pole, although he was well aware that such a union would\r\nbe highly distasteful to his people. When compelled to solicit the\r\nassistance of the palatines of Lithuania by all means in his power, it\r\nwas not surprising that he eagerly sought to ally himself with Mniszek:\r\nbut now that he was seated upon the throne of the czars, such an alliance\r\ncould not be otherwise than prejudicial to his interests. Yet he was the\r\nfirst to remember his promise, and as soon as he had been crowned at\r\nMoscow he sent to invite Marina to share his throne. When he signed the\r\npromise of marriage in Poland, he was, doubtless, under the influence\r\nof Marina’s charms, but at Moscow we cannot ascribe his impatience\r\nto conclude the projected union to the eagerness of love. For whilst\r\nVlassiev, bearing magnificent presents for the bride and all her family,\r\nwas on his way to Cracow to hasten their departure for Russia, the czar\r\nhad an acknowledged mistress, who resided with him in the Kremlin, and\r\nthis mistress was no other than the daughter of Boris.\r\n\r\n“Xenia,” writes a contemporary author, “was a girl of the greatest\r\nintelligence; her complexion was pink and white, and her black eyes\r\nsparkled with vivacity. When grief caused her to shed tears, they\r\nshone with a still greater radiance. Her eyebrows joined; her body\r\nwas formed with perfect symmetry, and was so white that it seemed to\r\nhave been moulded with cream. She was an accomplished person, speaking\r\nmore elegantly than a book. Her voice was melodious, and it was a real\r\npleasure to hear her sing songs.”\r\n\r\nThis beauty was fatal to Xenia. After witnessing the death of her mother\r\nand brother, she took refuge first of all in a convent, or, according to\r\nsome annalists, she found an asylum in the house of Prince Mstislavski.\r\nSoon afterwards she entered the palace of the enemy of her family, and\r\nfor some months she was the favourite mistress of the czar. It was\r\nprobably to her influence that several of the Godunovs were indebted for\r\ntheir lives, and even for some degree of favour. Whether she yielded to\r\nseduction or to violence, as some modern authors have asserted, it is\r\nimpossible to discover at the present day. It is no less impossible to\r\ndecide whether Dmitri allowed himself to be subdued by the charms of his\r\ncaptive, or whether, like a pitiless conqueror, he sacrificed her to his\r\narrogant vanity, and desired, with a refinement of vengeance, to inflict\r\nthe greatest dishonour on the enemy’s family. At all events, it appears\r\ncertain that for some time Xenia exercised such marked influence over\r\nhim that Mniszek grew alarmed, and seriously remonstrated with the czar.\r\nIt was only when Marina was actually on her way to Moscow that Dmitri\r\ndismissed his captive. He sent her into a monastery, according to the\r\nusage of the time. She took the vows in the convent of St. Sergius, at\r\nMoscow, under the name of Olga, and died there in 1622.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: RUSSIAN WEDDING FEAST OF THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY\r\n\r\n(From the painting by C. Makovski)\r\n\r\n_Original and copyright owned by Messrs. Schumann’s Sons, N. Y._]\r\n\r\nThese singular amours, this fidelity to his engagements in the midst\r\nof inconstancy and even of debauchery, this boldness in attempting a\r\ndesperate enterprise, this imperturbable coolness in maintaining an\r\naudacious imposture, this gracefulness in acting the part of a legitimate\r\nmonarch, so many brilliant qualities united with puerile vanity and the\r\nmost imprudent levity--such are the contrasts presented by the character\r\nof Dmitri, which are perhaps explicable by his extreme youth and his\r\nadventurer’s education. Nothing, however, is more rare than a character\r\nall the parts of which are in perfect harmony. Contradiction is the\r\ncharacteristic of most men, and there are very few whose lives correspond\r\nto the projects which they have formed or to the hopes to which they\r\nhave given rise. Who can say that the pleasure of exhibiting himself in\r\nall the splendour of his high fortune before the eyes of those who had\r\nwitnessed his poverty had not the greatest share in the resolutions of\r\nDmitri? Mniszek and Marina were probably the first persons whose esteem\r\nappeared precious to him. To obtain the approbation of a few Polish\r\npalatines, he risked his crown; but does not every man believe that the\r\nworld’s opinion is that of the little circle in which he is accustomed to\r\nmove?[b]\r\n\r\nThe security of the pretender was, however, but seeming. Vasili Shuiski,\r\nwhom Dmitri had pardoned, presently organised a plot for his destruction.\r\nThe czar’s extreme confidence was his ruin. One night the boyars assailed\r\nthe Kremlin where no guard was kept. Demetrius was flung from a window\r\nand slaughtered in the courtyard of the palace. Basmanov, who had tried\r\nto defend him, was killed at his side. The corpse of Demetrius was taken\r\nup, a fool’s mask was placed on the face, and the body exposed in the\r\nplace of executions between a bagpipe and a flute. The father-in-law\r\nand the widow of Dmitri, the envoys of the Polish king and the Poles\r\nwho had come to attend the imperial nuptials were spared but retained\r\nas prisoners by the boyars. The corpse of the “sorcerer” was burned; a\r\ncannon, turned in the direction of Poland, was charged with the ashes and\r\nscattered them to the winds (May, 1606).[f]\r\n\r\n\r\nVASILI IVANOVITCH SHUISKI (1606-1610 A.D.)\r\n\r\nImmediately after the death of Demetrius, the boyars concerted measures\r\nfor convoking deputies from all the towns and proceeding to the election\r\nof a new sovereign; but they were not allowed to accomplish their\r\ndesign. The throne had been but four days vacant when Shuiski directed\r\nhis partisans to proclaim himself. They led him forth into the public\r\nplace, named him czar by acclamation, and immediately escorted him to the\r\ncathedral. There, in order to ingratiate himself with his new subjects\r\nand make them forget the illegality of his election, he took a solemn\r\noath not to punish anyone without the advice and consent of the boyars;\r\nnot to visit the offences of the fathers on the children; and that he\r\nwould never revenge himself in any way on those who had offended him in\r\nthe time of Boris. Since Novgorod lost its privileges, this was the first\r\ntime that a sovereign of Russia had pledged himself to any convention\r\nwith his subjects; but Shuiski’s oath was no guarantee for its fulfilment.\r\n\r\nHaving good reason to dread the resentment of the Polish nation,\r\nShuiski sent Prince Volkonski on an embassy to them, to represent the\r\nlate czar as an impostor, who had deluded both Poland and Russia; but\r\nthe ambassador was not even listened to. Sigismund and his subjects\r\nwere resolved to be revenged on the Russians, and to profit by the\r\ndisturbances which they foresaw would soon break out among them. Shuiski\r\nwas not liked by the Russian nobles, many of whom might have competed\r\nwith him for the throne had the choice of the nation been free; and his\r\nconduct after his elevation augmented the number of his enemies. In spite\r\nof his oath he could not forget any of his old grudges; and he ventured\r\nto indulge them just enough to exasperate their objects without depriving\r\nthem of the power of retaliation. Moscow was the only city in the empire\r\non the allegiance of which he could rely; but even there the people had\r\nimbibed from their late excesses an alarming propensity to disorder and\r\nmutiny. To meet all the dangers thickening round him Shuiski had neither\r\nan army nor money; for Dmitri’s profusions and the pillage of the Kremlin\r\nhad exhausted the imperial treasury. His chief strength lay in his renown\r\nfor orthodoxy, which insured him the favour of the clergy. The more to\r\nstrengthen his interests in that direction, he made it his first business\r\nto depose and send to a monastery the heretic patriarch Ignatius, who had\r\nbeen appointed by Dmitri, and to nominate in his stead Hermogenes, bishop\r\nof Kasan, an aged prelate whose simplicity rendered him a useful tool in\r\nthe hands of the crafty czar.\r\n\r\nRumours began to be rife in the provinces, and even in Moscow, that\r\nDmitri was not dead. Many of those who had seen his mangled body exposed\r\ndenied its identity, and believed that one of the czar’s officers had\r\nbeen massacred instead of him. Four swift horses were missing from the\r\nimperial stables; and it was surmised that by means of them Dmitri had\r\nescaped in the midst of the tumult. Three strangers in Russian costume,\r\nbut speaking Polish, crossed the Oka in a boat, and one of them gave the\r\nferryman six ducats, saying, “You have ferried the czar; when he comes\r\nback to Moscow with a Polish army he will not forget this service.” The\r\nsame party held similar language in a German inn a little farther on.\r\nIt was afterwards known that one of them was Prince Shakhovskoi, who,\r\nimmediately upon the death of Dmitri, had, with singular promptitude,\r\nconceived the idea of finding a new impostor to personate the dead one.\r\n\r\nTo put an end to the alarming rumours, Shuiski sent to Uglitch for the\r\nbody of the real czarevitch, that with the help of the patriarch he might\r\nmake a saint of him. When the grave was opened the body of the young\r\nprince was found in a perfect state of preservation, with the fresh hue\r\nof life upon it, and still holding in his hands some nuts as miraculously\r\npreserved as itself. It is curious that Shuiski should have forgotten\r\nthat nothing was said of these nuts in the report of the inquest at\r\nUglitch signed by himself. That document only stated that at the moment\r\nof his death the czarevitch was amusing himself with sticking his knife\r\nin the ground. Notwithstanding this oversight, the act of canonisation\r\nwas good policy; for if the czarevitch became an object of veneration for\r\nthe people, if it was notorious that his body worked miracles on earth,\r\nand consequently that his soul was in heaven, then anyone assuming his\r\nname could be nothing but an impostor. The czar took pains to make known\r\nfar and wide what prodigies were effected by the relics of the blessed\r\nmartyr. But the credit of the new saint was of short duration: Shuiski\r\nhimself damaged it by a gross blunder in permitting the pompous removal\r\nto the monastery of Troitsa of the remains of Boris Godunov, whom but\r\na few days before he had named as the murderer of the sainted Dmitri.\r\nNo doubt he hoped in this way to conciliate the partisans of a still\r\npowerful family; but his enemies immediately accused him of blasphemous\r\nwickedness, alleging that he had substituted the body of a newly murdered\r\nboy for the decomposed corpse of the real Dmitri.\r\n\r\nThe public retractations of the dowager czaritza obtained no more credit\r\nthan the miracles imputed to her son. In a letter signed by her, and\r\nimmediately published by Vasili, she declared that the impostor Grishka\r\nOtrepiev had threatened her with death to herself and all her family\r\nif she did not recognise him as her son. But who could believe in her\r\nsincerity after so many contradictory avowals and disavowals? Her\r\ndeclaration that she had been compelled by fear to yield to the threats\r\nof a man whose aversion to cruelty was notorious, suggested to everybody\r\nthe idea that she acted at that moment under the coercion of threats and\r\nfear.\r\n\r\nCivil war began. Prince Shakhovskoi had raised the inhabitants of\r\nPutivle, and in a few days assembled a great number of Cossacks and\r\npeasants, who routed the forces sent against them. The insurrection\r\nspread rapidly; but still the prince, twice miraculously saved, did not\r\nmake his expected appearance. Instead of him there came from Poland a\r\ngeneral with a commission bearing the imperial seal of Dmitri. This\r\nwas an adventurer named Ivan Bolotnikov, originally a serf to Prince\r\nTeliatevski. He had been a prisoner among the Turks, and having escaped\r\nto Venice had probably acquired some military experience in the service\r\nof the republic. His commission was recognised at Putivle; he took the\r\ncommand of the insurgents, defeated Shuiski’s forces in two engagements,\r\nand pursued them to within seven versts of the capital. But the\r\ninexplicable absence of the prince for whom they fought damped the ardour\r\nof Bolotnikov’s men; for they could not believe that if Dmitri was alive\r\nhe would delay to put himself at their head. The ataman of the Cossacks,\r\ntoo, was mortified at being supplanted in the command by an adventurer,\r\nand suffered himself to be corrupted by Shuiski. Deserted by a part of\r\nhis army, Bolotnikov was defeated by Skopin Shuiski, the czar’s nephew,\r\nand forced to shelter himself in the fortress of Kaluga.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [1607 A.D.]]\r\n\r\nIt is probable that all this while Shakhovskoi and the Poles were looking\r\nabout for a fit person to play the part of Dmitri; but it required time\r\nto find him, and to put him through training. In this conjuncture the\r\nfalse Peter Feodorovitch, who had made a brief appearance in the former\r\nreign, repaired to Putivle, and offered himself to Shakhovskoi and the\r\npeople as regent in the absence of his uncle. The rebel cause stood\r\nin need of the prestige of a royal name, and the czarevitch Peter was\r\neagerly welcomed. Presently, the czar having marched against him in\r\nperson, the impostor and Shakhovskoi shut themselves up in the strongly\r\nfortified town of Tula, where they were joined by Bolotnikov. Vasili\r\nlaid siege to the town with an army of a hundred thousand men; but the\r\nbesieged, who had no mercy to expect if taken, fought more earnestly for\r\ntheir own lives than did Shuiski’s soldiers for the rights of a master to\r\nwhom they were but little attached. Seeing the light progress he made,\r\nthe czar began to doubt the success of an enterprise to fail in which\r\nwould be ruin.\r\n\r\nWhile he was in this anxious state, an obscure ecclesiastic, named\r\nKravkov, presented himself before the czar and his council, and\r\nundertook, if his directions were followed, to drown all the people\r\nof Tula. They laughed at him at first as an idle braggart, but he\r\nreiterated his assertion with such confidence that the czar at last\r\ndesired him to explain his plan. Tula is situated in a valley, and the\r\nlittle river Upa flows through the town. Kravkov proposed to dam the\r\nstream below the town, and engaged to answer for it with his head if\r\nin a few hours after the execution of that work the whole town was not\r\nlaid under water. All the millers in the army, men accustomed to such\r\noperations, were immediately put under his orders, and the rest of the\r\nsoldiers were employed in carrying sacks of earth to the spot chosen for\r\nthe dam. The water soon rose in the town, inundated the streets, and\r\ndestroyed a great number of houses; but the garrison still fought for\r\nseveral months with unabated courage, though decimated by famine, and\r\nafterwards by a terrible epidemic. All the efforts both of the besiegers\r\nand the besieged were concentrated about the dam, the former labouring\r\nto raise and maintain it, the latter to break it down. The inhabitants\r\nof Tula were persuaded that magic must have had some share in raising\r\nso prodigious a work with such rapidity, and magic was not neglected\r\namong the means by which they sought to destroy it. A monk, who boasted\r\nhis proficiency in that art, offered to effect the desired object for a\r\nreward of a hundred roubles. His terms being accepted by Bolotnikov, he\r\nstripped, plunged into the river, and disappeared. An hour afterwards,\r\nwhen everyone had given him up for dead, he rose to the surface, with\r\nhis body covered with scratches. “I have just had to do,” he said, “with\r\nthe twelve thousand devils at work on Shuiski’s dam. I have settled six\r\nthousand of them, but the other six thousand are the worst of all, and\r\nwill not give in.”\r\n\r\nFor a long time the inhabitants of Tula continued to fight against men\r\nand devils, encouraged by letters they received in Dmitri’s name, with\r\npromises of succour which never came. Shakhovskoi, the chief instigator\r\nof the rebellion, was the first to propose a capitulation, and was\r\nthrust into a dungeon by the Cossacks. At last, when the besieged had\r\neaten their horses, dogs, and all other carrion, and had not so much as\r\nan oxhide left to gnaw, Bolotnikov and Peter offered to capitulate on\r\ncondition of amnesty for their heroic garrison. They asked nothing for\r\nthemselves, but declared that unless their soldiers obtained honourable\r\nconditions they were resolved to die with arms in their hands, and even\r\nto eat each other, rather than surrender at discretion. Vasili accepted\r\nthese terms, and the gates were opened to him (October, 1607). Bolotnikov\r\nadvanced before the czar with undaunted mien, and presenting his sword,\r\nwith the edge laid against his neck, offered himself as a victim, saying,\r\n“I have kept the oath I swore to him who, rightfully or wrongfully,\r\ncalls himself Dmitri. Deserted by him, I am in thy power. Cut off my\r\nhead if thou wilt; or if thou wilt spare my life, I will serve thee as\r\nI served him.” Shuiski, who did not pique himself on generosity, sent\r\nBolotnikov to Kargopol, where he soon after had him drowned. The false\r\nPeter Feodorovitch was hanged; but Shakhovskoi, the most guilty of the\r\nthree, was more fortunate. The victor found him in chains when he entered\r\nTula, and Shakhovskoi made a merit of his sufferings at the hands of\r\nthe obstinate rebels whom he had urged to submit to their sovereign. He\r\nobtained his liberty; but the first use he made of it was to rekindle the\r\nflames of insurrection.\r\n\r\nBefore Shuiski had terminated the siege of Tula, and whilst the issue of\r\nhis conflict with one pretender was still dubious, another, assuming the\r\nname of Dmitri, appeared in the frontier town of Starodub, where he was\r\nhailed with enthusiasm. Bolotnikov sent an officer to him from Tula, to\r\nacquaint him with the desperate condition of the town. This envoy was\r\na Polish adventurer, named Zarucki, who had become one of the atamans\r\nof the Don Cossacks, had fought bravely for the first Demetrius, and\r\nbeen distinguished by his favour. Although the first glance must have\r\nsatisfied Zarucki that the new pretender was an imposter, he affected\r\nwithout the least hesitation to recognise him as his former master.\r\nAnother false witness of this identity was the Pane Miechaviecki, a Pole,\r\nwho was well known for the eminent position he had held at the court\r\nof the first Demetrius, and who was now the secret instructor of his\r\nsuccessor in what we may call the histrionic details belonging to his\r\nassumed character.\r\n\r\nThe pupil profited but badly by the lessons he received; for in\r\neverything but profusion he was the reverse of his prototype, and the\r\nleast attentive observer could see that he was a coarse, ignorant, vulgar\r\nknave, qualified only by his impudence for the part he had undertaken.\r\nThe Cossacks were not such fastidious critics as to be shocked by his\r\nuncourtly manners; but the Poles, whilst treating him as a sovereign for\r\ntheir own ends, were by no means the dupes of his gross imposture. Baer\r\nstates that he was originally a schoolmaster of Sokol, in White Russia;\r\nbut, according to the Polish writers, who had better opportunities of\r\nlearning the truth, he was a Lithuanian Jew, named Michael Moltchanov.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [1608 A.D.]]\r\n\r\nThe adherents of Dmitri, as we may continue to call him, increased so\r\nrapidly in numbers that he was able to defeat a detachment of Vasili’s\r\narmy sent against him from Tula, and to make himself master of the town\r\nof Kozelsk on the road to the capital. When the fall of Tula had left the\r\nczar at liberty to act against him with all his forces, Dmitri retreated\r\nto Novgorod Seversk. There he was joined by unexpected reinforcements led\r\nby Rozynckil Sapieha, Tiszkievicz, Lissovski, and others, the flower of\r\nthe Polish and Lithuanian chivalry. Prince Adam Viszinoviecki, the patron\r\nof the first false Dmitri, came in person to the aid of his successor at\r\nthe head of two thousand horse. The Don Cossacks brought in chains to him\r\nanother schemer, who had tried to put himself at their head. All that\r\nis known of the man is that he called himself Feodor Feodorovitch, and\r\npretended to be the son of the czar Feodor. His more prosperous rival in\r\nimposture condemned him to death.\r\n\r\nDmitri’s army, commanded by the veteran prince Roman Rozinski, defeated\r\nthat of the czar with great havoc near Volkhov, on the 24th of April\r\n1608. All the vanquished who escaped the lances of the Poles and Cossacks\r\nfled in disorder to Moscow, and had the victors pressed their advantage,\r\nthe capital would have fallen into their hands. Possibly the Polish\r\nleaders were in secret unwilling to let their _protégé_ triumph too soon\r\nor too completely, or to give up Moscow to pillage, which is always more\r\nprofitable to the soldier than to the general; but, whatever was the\r\nreason, they halted at the village of Tushino, twelve versts from Moscow,\r\nwhich the impostor made his headquarters, and there he held his court for\r\nseventeen months.\r\n\r\nWith a view to prevail on Sigismund to recall the Polish volunteers\r\nin Dmitri’s service, Vasili resolved to liberate the ambassadors, the\r\npalatine of Sendomir and his daughter, and the other Poles whom he had\r\nkept in captivity since the massacre of Moscow. With their liberty he\r\nbestowed on them indemnifications for their losses, and only exacted\r\nfrom them a pledge that they would not bear arms against Russia, or in\r\nany way favour the new pretender. Thus, after having made sport of the\r\nmost solemn oaths, Vasili expected to find in men, so deeply provoked,\r\nscruples of conscience which he had never known himself. He sent\r\nMniszek and his daughter away under charge of an escort; but they were\r\nintercepted by a detachment of Poles, and carried to Dmitri’s camp.\r\n\r\nThey had been prepared for this event by a letter previously received\r\nby the palatine from his pretended son-in-law, which contained this\r\nremarkable phrase: “Come both of you to me, instead of going to hide\r\nyourselves in Poland from the world’s scorn.” He could hardly have\r\ndropped a hint more adapted to move a woman of Marina’s character.\r\nRather than go back to encounter ridicule at Sendomir, she was willing\r\nto share the bed of a bandit who might bestow a crown upon her. It is\r\nsaid, however, that in their first interview with Dmitri neither she nor\r\nher father testified all the emotion befitting so touching an occasion,\r\nnor could quite conceal their surprise at the sight of a man not at all\r\nlike him whose name he bore. But after a few days the scene of meeting\r\nwas played over again with more success, and the whole camp was witness\r\nof Marina’s demonstrations of tenderness for her husband. In apology\r\nfor her previous coldness it was said that, having so long believed her\r\nDmitri was dead, she durst not yield to the delight of seeing him alive\r\nagain until she had received the most certain proofs that it was not a\r\ndelusion. This clumsy excuse was admitted; Marina’s recognition of the\r\nimpostor brought over to him numbers who had doubted till then; and, the\r\nnews being soon spread abroad, almost all Russia declared for him, except\r\nMoscow, Novgorod, and Smolensk.\r\n\r\nThis was the culminating point of his fortunes: their decline was rapid.\r\nThe mutual jealousy of the Polish commanders rose to such a pitch that\r\nit became necessary to divide the army; and Sapieha quitted the camp of\r\nTushino, with thirty thousand men and sixty cannon, to lay siege to the\r\nfamous monastery of the Trinity, near Moscow, which was at the same time\r\na powerful fortress and the most revered sanctuary of Russian orthodoxy.\r\nThe support which Shuiski received from the monks was worth more to him\r\nthan an army; for besides large subsidies he derived from them a moral\r\nforce which still kept many of his subjects true to their allegiance.\r\nThe loss of such auxiliaries would have consummated his ruin; therefore\r\nthe capture of the monastery was of extreme importance to the impostor.\r\nBut in spite of the most strenuous efforts, continued for six weeks,\r\nSapieha was unable to obtain the least advantage over a garrison whose\r\ncourage was exalted by religious enthusiasm; and meanwhile the Poles had\r\nto sustain a harassing and murderous guerilla warfare, waged against them\r\nby the plundered peasants, whom they had made desperate. These partisan\r\nbands were about to be supported by a more formidable army, led by Skopin\r\nSkuiski and by James de la Gardie, who brought five thousand Swedish\r\nauxiliaries to Vasili’s aid.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [1609-1610 A.D.]]\r\n\r\nEarly in 1609 these two generals began a brilliant campaign in the north;\r\nthe Poles and the partisans of the impostor were beaten in several\r\nencounters, and in a few months the whole aspect of the war was changed.\r\nFinally, Sapieha himself was defeated in an obstinate engagement, forced\r\nignominiously to raise the siege of the monastery, and shut himself\r\nup with the remnant of his force in Dmitrov. Skopin entered Moscow in\r\ntriumph; but Vasili’s jealousy kept him there inactive for two months\r\nuntil he died suddenly, in his twenty-fourth year. Vasili, to whose cause\r\nthe young hero’s death was fatal, was accused by public rumour of having\r\neffected it by poison.\r\n\r\nFor some months before this time there had been a new champion in the\r\nfield, whose appearance was equally to be dreaded by Shuiski and Dmitri.\r\nAbout the end of September, 1609, Sigismund, king of Poland, laid siege\r\nto Smolensk, with an army of twelve thousand men, and immediately\r\nsummoned to his standard the Poles who served under Dmitri. The greater\r\npart of them complied, and the impostor fled to Kaluga. In the spring\r\nof 1610 Russia presented a most deplorable spectacle, being devastated\r\nby three great armies, all opposed to one another. In the west,\r\nSigismund was pressing the siege of Smolensk; in the south, Dmitri was\r\nin possession of Kaluga, Tula, and some other towns. Some of the Poles\r\nwho had quitted the impostor’s service had established themselves on the\r\nbanks of the Ugra, in a fertile country, which had not yet experienced\r\nthe sufferings of war; and there, under the command of their new leader,\r\nJohn Sapieha, they offered their services simultaneously to Sigismund\r\nand the false Dmitri, being ready to join whichever of them bid highest.\r\nNor was this all: one of the Russian princes, Procope Liapunov, took\r\nadvantage of the general confusion to raise a new banner. He proclaimed\r\nhimself the defender of the faith, and, at the head of a considerable\r\nforce, waged a war of extermination against the Poles and the Russians\r\nwho recognised either Dmitri or Vasili. A chronicler applies to him the\r\nphrase which had served to characterise Attila--“No grass grew where his\r\nhorse’s hoof had been.” And, as if all these armies were not enough for\r\nthe desolation of the land, the Tatars of the Crimea had crossed the\r\nOka, under pretence of succouring Vasili, their ally, but in reality to\r\nplunder the villages, and make multitudes of captives, whom they carried\r\noff into slavery.\r\n\r\nSuch was the condition of Russia at the moment of Skopin’s death. Vasili\r\nstill derived some hope from the division of his enemies, and turned his\r\nwhole attention against the most formidable among them. He despatched to\r\nthe relief of Smolensk an army of nearly sixty thousand men, consisting\r\npartly of foreign mercenaries, under James de la Gardie; but he gave\r\nthe chief command to his brother, Dmitri Shuiski, who was neither liked\r\nnor respected by the soldiers. Chiefly in consequence of this fatal\r\nappointment the whole army was defeated at Klushino, by a force of\r\nonly three thousand horse and two hundred infantry, led by the veteran\r\nZolkiewski, and was forced to lay down its arms. But for the enormous\r\nblunders subsequently committed by Sigismund, the battle of Klushino\r\nmight have determined forever the preponderance of Poland in the north.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A WOMAN OF TSCHUTSKI]\r\n\r\nThe defeat of Klushino was immediately followed by an insurrection\r\nat Moscow. Vasili Shuiski was deposed, and forced to become a monk;\r\nand being soon after delivered up to Sigismund, he ended his days in\r\na Polish prison. The same event was equally disastrous to the false\r\nDmitri. Deserted by Sapieha and his Poles, he lost all hope of ascending\r\nthe throne of Moscow; he lived as a robber in Kaluga, at the head of\r\nhis ferocious gangs of Cossacks and Tatars, until he was murdered by\r\nthe latter in December, 1610, in revenge for the death of one of their\r\ncountrymen whom he had drowned. Marina was far advanced in pregnancy when\r\nshe lost her second husband. She was delivered of a son, who received\r\nthe name of Ivan, and to whom the little court of Kaluga swore fealty.\r\nZarucki declared himself the protector of the mother and the child, and\r\nput himself at the head of the still numerous remnant of the faction that\r\nremained obstinately attached to the name of Dmitri. But the cause was\r\nhopeless; for Zarucki was neither a general nor a statesman--his talents\r\nwere those only of a bold leader of Cossack marauders.\r\n\r\nRussia was without a sovereign, and the capital was in the hands of the\r\nPolish marshal. Zolkiewski used his advantages with wise moderation,\r\nand easily prevailed on the weary and afflicted Muscovites to resign\r\nthemselves to the foreign yoke, and agree to offer the throne to\r\nWladislaw, the son of Sigismund. One word from the latter’s lips might\r\nhave reversed the subsequent fortunes of Russia and Poland; but in his\r\nselfish vanity he preferred the appearance of power to its reality,\r\nand claimed the crown of the czars, not for his son but for himself.\r\nPhilaretes, bishop of Rostov, and other ambassadors, were sent to him at\r\nhis camp before Smolensk, to make known the resolution of the Russians in\r\nfavour of Wladislaw. Sigismund insisted that they should at once put him\r\nin possession of Smolensk, which he had been besieging for a year; and,\r\nthis being refused, he seized the ambassadors, and afterwards carried\r\nthem away to Poland, where they remained nine years in captivity.\r\n\r\nZolkiewski, foreseeing the consequences of his master’s folly, against\r\nwhich he had remonstrated in vain, retired from the government of\r\nMoscow, leaving Gonsiewski as his successor. The Polish troops seized\r\nthe principal towns, proclaimed Sigismund, and observed none of that\r\ndiscretion by which the great marshal had won the confidence and esteem\r\nof the vanquished. National feeling awoke again among the Russians;\r\neagerly responding to the call of their revered patriarch, Hermogenes,\r\nthey took up arms in all parts of the empire, and war was renewed with\r\nmore fury than ever.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [1612-1613 A.D.]]\r\n\r\nSmolensk fell after an obstinate resistance of eighteen months; but at\r\nthe moment of the last assault the explosion of a powder magazine set\r\nfire to the city, and Sigismund found himself master only of a heap of\r\nruins. The Poles in Moscow, assailed by the Russians, secured themselves\r\nin the Kremlin, after burning down the greater part of the city, and\r\nmassacring a hundred thousand of the inhabitants. They were besieged by\r\nan immense levy from the provinces, consisting of three armies; but these\r\nseemed more disposed to fight with each other than to force the Poles in\r\ntheir intrenchments. One of them consisted chiefly of vagabonds escaped\r\nfrom the camp at Tushino, and was commanded by Prince Trubetskoi. Zarucki\r\nled another in the name of Marina’s son; the third army, and the only\r\none, perhaps, whose commander sincerely desired the independence of his\r\ncountry, was that of Prince Procope Liapunov; but that brave leader was\r\nassassinated, and the besiegers, disheartened by his death, immediately\r\ndispersed. About the same time the patriarch Hermogenes, the soul of the\r\nnational insurrection, died in his prison in the Kremlin, to which he had\r\nbeen consigned by the Poles.\r\n\r\nAnarchy was rampant in Russia; every town usurped the right to act in\r\nthe name of the whole empire, and set up chiefs whom they deposed a few\r\ndays afterwards. Kazan and Viatka proclaimed the son of Marina; Novgorod,\r\nrather than open its gates to the Poles, called in the Swedes, and\r\ntendered the crown to Charles Philip, second son of the reigning king\r\nof Sweden, and brother of Gustavus Adolphus. Another imposter assumed\r\nthe name of Dmitri, and kept his state for awhile at Pskov; but being\r\nat last identified as one Isidore, a fugitive monk, he was hanged.\r\nWhen all seemed lost in irretrievable disorder, the country was saved\r\nby an obscure citizen of Nijni-Novgorod. He was a butcher, named Kozma\r\nMinin, distinguished by nothing but the possession of a sound head and a\r\nbrave, honest unselfish heart. Roused by his words and his example, his\r\nfellow-citizens took up arms, and resolved to devote all their wealth to\r\nthe last fraction to the maintenance of an army for the deliverance of\r\ntheir country. From Nijni-Novgorod the same spirit spread to other towns,\r\nand Prince Pojarski who had been lieutenant to the brave Liapunov, was\r\nsoon able to take the field at the head of a considerable force, whilst\r\nMinin, whom the popular voice styled the elect of the whole Russian\r\nEmpire, ably seconded him in an administrative capacity.\r\n\r\nPojarski drove the Poles before him from town to town; and having\r\nat length arrived under the walls of the Kremlin, in August, 1612,\r\nhe sustained for three days a hot contest against Chodkiewicz, the\r\nsuccessor of Gonsiewski, defeated him, and put him to flight. Part of the\r\nPolish troops, under the command of Colonel Nicholas Struss, returned\r\nto the citadel and defended it for some weeks longer. At the end of\r\nthat time, being pressed by famine, they capitulated; and on the 22nd\r\nof October, 1612, the princes Pojarski and Dmitri Trubetzkoi entered\r\ntogether into that inclosure which is the heart of the country, and\r\nsacred in the eyes of all true Russians. The assistance of Sigismund came\r\ntoo late to arrest the flight of the Poles.\r\n\r\nUpon the first successes obtained by Prince Pojarski the phantom of\r\nDmitri, and all the subaltern pretenders, disappeared as if by magic.\r\nZarucki, feeling that an irresistible power was about to overwhelm him,\r\nwas anxious only to secure himself a refuge. Carrying Marina and her\r\nson with him, he made ineffectual efforts to raise the Don Cossacks.\r\nAfter suffering a defeat near Voroneje, he reached the Volga, and took\r\npossession of Astrakhan, with the intention of fortifying himself there;\r\nbut the generals of Michael Romanov, the newly elected czar, did not\r\nallow him time. Driven from that city, and pursued by superior forces,\r\nhe was preparing to reach the eastern shore of the Caspian, when he was\r\nsurprised, in the beginning of July, 1614, on the banks of the Iaïk, and\r\ndelivered up to the Muscovite generals, along with Marina and the son of\r\nthe second Dmitri. They were immediately taken to Moscow, where Zarucki\r\nwas impaled; Ivan, who was but three years old, was hanged; and Marina\r\nwas shut up in prison, where she ended her days.\r\n\r\n\r\nACCESSION OF THE HOUSE OF ROMANOV (1613 A.D.)\r\n\r\nThe deliverance of Moscow had alone been awaited in order to fill the\r\nvacant throne by a free election. This could not properly take place\r\nexcept in that revered sanctuary of the imperial power, the Kremlin,\r\nwhere the sovereigns were crowned at their accession, and where their\r\nashes reposed after their death. Delivered now from all foreign\r\ninfluence, the boyars of the council, in November, 1612, despatched\r\nletters or mandates to every town in the empire, commanding the clergy,\r\nnobility, and citizens to send deputies immediately to Moscow, endowed\r\nwith full power to meet in the national council (_zemskii soveth_),\r\nand proceed to the election of a new czar. At the same time, to invoke\r\nthe blessing of God upon this important act, a fast of three days was\r\ncommanded. These orders were received with great enthusiasm throughout\r\nthe whole country: the fast was so rigorously observed, according to\r\ncontemporary records, that no person took the least nourishment during\r\nthat interval, and mothers even refused the breast to their infants.\r\n\r\nThe election day came: it was in Lent, in the year 1613. The debates\r\nwere long and stormy. The princes Mstislavski and Pojarski, it appears,\r\nrefused the crown; the election of Prince Dmitri Trubetskoi failed, and\r\nthe other candidates were set aside for various reasons. After much\r\nhesitation the name of Michael Romanov was put forward; a young man\r\nsixteen years of age, personally unknown, but recommended by the virtues\r\nof his father, Philaretes, and in whose behalf the boyars had been\r\ncanvassed by the patriarch Hermogenes, the holy martyr to the national\r\ncause. The Romanovs were connected through the female branch with this\r\nancient dynasty. The ancestors of Michael had filled the highest offices\r\nin the state. He fulfilled, moreover, the required conditions. “There\r\nwere but three surviving members in his family,” says Strahlenberg; “he\r\nhad not been implicated in the preceding troubles; his father was an\r\necclesiastic, and in consequence naturally more disposed to secure peace\r\nand union than to mix himself up in turbulent projects.”\r\n\r\nThe name of the new candidate, supported by the metropolitan of\r\nMoscow,[37] was hailed with acclamation, and after some discussion he was\r\nelected. The unanimous voice of the assembly raised Michael Feodorovitch\r\nto the throne. Before he ascended he was required to swear to the\r\nfollowing conditions: that he would protect religion; that he would\r\npardon and forget all that had been done to his father; that he would\r\nmake no new laws, nor alter the old, unless circumstances imperatively\r\nrequired it; and that, in important causes, he would decide nothing by\r\nhimself, but that the existing laws and the usual forms of trial should\r\nremain in force; that he would not at his own pleasure make either war or\r\npeace with his neighbours; and that, to avoid all suits with individuals,\r\nhe would resign his estates to his family, or incorporate them with the\r\ncrown domains. Strahlenberg adds that Alexis, on his accession, swore to\r\nobserve the same conditions.\r\n\r\nThese forms, however futile they may have been, are remarkable: not\r\nbecause they render sacred a right which stands in no need of them, but\r\nbecause they recall it to mind; and also because they prove that, even\r\non the soil most favourable to despotism, a charter which should give\r\nabsolute power to a monarch would appear such a gross absurdity that we\r\nknow not that an instance of the kind ever existed.\r\n\r\nNothing could be more critical than the state of the empire at the moment\r\nwhen its destinies were confided to a youth of seventeen. Disorder and\r\nanarchy everywhere prevailed. Ustrialov gives us the following picture:\r\n“The strongholds on the frontier which should have served to defend his\r\ndominions were in the hands of external or internal enemies. The Swedes\r\npossessed Kexholm, Oresheck, Koporie, and even Novgorod. The Poles ruled\r\nin Smolensk, Dorogobuje, Putivle, and Tchernigov; the country around\r\nPskov was in the power of Lisovski; Raisin, Kashira, and Tula struggled\r\nfeebly against the Tatars of the Crimea and the Nogai; Sarutzki (Zarucki)\r\nwas established in Astrakhan; Kazan was in revolt. At home bands of\r\nCossacks from the Don, and the Zaparogians, and whole divisions of Poles\r\nand Tatars ravaged the villages and the convents that were still entire,\r\nwhen there were hopes of finding booty. The country was wasted, soldiers\r\nwere dying of hunger, the land-tax was no longer collected, and not a\r\nkopeck was in the treasury. The state jewels, crowns of great price,\r\nsceptres, precious stones, vases--all had been plundered and carried into\r\nPoland.\r\n\r\n“The young prince was surrounded by courtiers belonging to twenty\r\ndifferent factions. There were to be found the friends of Godunov, the\r\ndefenders of Shuiski, the companions of Wladislaw, and even partisans\r\nof the brigand of Tushino--in a word, men professing the most various\r\nopinions and aims, but all equally ambitious, and incapable of yielding\r\nthe smallest point as regarded precedence. The lower class, irritated by\r\nten years of misery, had become habituated to anarchy, and it was not\r\nwithout difficulty and resistance on their part that they were reduced\r\nto obedience.” Such, then, was the situation of the country; but Michael\r\nfound means to redeem it.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [1617-1627 A.D.]]\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the desperate state of his finances, the insubordination\r\nof his troops, the ill-will of the diets, and the confederations\r\ncontinually springing up against him, Sigismund did not abandon his\r\nattempts upon Russia; but the negotiations which ensued in consequence,\r\nupon various occasions, produced no result. Wladislaw, at the head of an\r\narmy, once more crossed the frontiers, and appeared for the second time,\r\nin 1617, under the walls of Moscow, which he assaulted and whence he was\r\nrepulsed. Deceived in the expectation which the intelligence he kept up\r\nwith various chiefs had induced him to form, harassed by his troops, who\r\nwere clamorous for pay, he consented to renounce the title of czar, which\r\nhe had up to that period assumed, and concluded, on the 1st of December,\r\n1618, an armistice for fourteen years. The Peace of Stolbovna, January\r\n26th, 1617, had terminated the preceding year the war with Sweden, and\r\nwas purchased by the surrender of Ingria, Karelia, and the whole country\r\nbetween Ingria and Novgorod; besides the formal renunciation of Livonia\r\nand Esthonia, and the payment of a sum of money.\r\n\r\nThe captivity of Philarete had now lasted nine years; from Warsaw he\r\nhad been removed to the castle of Marienburg, and it was from that\r\nplace, as it is asserted, that he found means to communicate with the\r\ncouncil of the boyars, and use his influence in the election of the\r\nczar, never dreaming that it would fall upon his son. The cessation of\r\nhostilities restored him to freedom. He returned to Moscow on the 14th\r\nof June, 1619, and was immediately elevated to the patriarchal chair,\r\nwhich had remained vacant from the death of Hermogenes, in 1613. His son\r\nmade him co-regent, and the ukases of that date are all headed “Michael\r\nFeodorovitch, sovereign, czar, and grand prince of all the Russias, and\r\nhis father Philarete, mighty lord and most holy patriarch of all the\r\nRussias, order,” etc. There exist, moreover, ukases issued in the sole\r\nname of the patriarch, thus called out of his usual sphere of action, and\r\nplaced in one in which absolute power was granted him. He took part in\r\nall political affairs; all foreign ambassadors were presented to him, as\r\nwell as to the czar: and at those solemn audiences, as well as at table,\r\nhe occupied the right of the sovereign. He held his own court, composed\r\nof stolnicks and other officers; in a word, he shared with his son all\r\nthe prerogatives of supreme power. From this period dates the splendour\r\nof the patriarchate, which at a later epoch excited the jealousy of the\r\nczar Peter the Great, who was induced to suppress it in 1721.\r\n\r\nPhilarete always gave wise advice to his son, and the influence he\r\nexercised over him was always happily directed. A general census, of\r\nwhich he originated the idea, produced great improvement in the revenue;\r\nbut, perhaps without intending it, he contributed by this measure to\r\ngive fixity to the system of bondage to the soil. In the performance of\r\nhis duty as head pastor, he directed all his efforts to re-establish a\r\npress at Moscow,[38] which had been abandoned during the troubles of the\r\ninterregnum; and he had the satisfaction of seeing, after 1624, many\r\ncopies of the Liturgy issue from it.[h]\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE COSSACKS\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [1627 A.D.]]\r\n\r\nIn the year 1627 the Cossacks of the Don, in one of their periodical\r\nuprisings, conquered Azov, which they offered to the czar, but which he\r\ndid not accept. As we shall meet the Cossacks again from time to time, it\r\nis worth while to interrupt our main narrative to make inquiry as to the\r\nantecedents of this peculiar people.[a]\r\n\r\nSoloviev gives the following definition of the term “cossacks”: “At the\r\nend of the first half of the fifteenth century we encounter for the\r\nfirst time the name of Cossack, principally the Cossacks of Riazan.\r\nOur ancestors understood by this name, in general, men without homes,\r\ncelibates obliged to earn their bread by working for others. In this\r\nway the name “cossack” took the meaning of day-labourer. They formed\r\na class altogether opposed to land owners; that is, the villagers. The\r\nsteppes, so agreeable to live on, not lacking fertility, watered by\r\nrivers filled with fish, attracted in these countries the more hardy,\r\nnamely the Cossacks; the people who could not stay in villages, those who\r\nwere pursued for some crime, fugitive serfs, united with each other; it\r\nis this group of individuals who formed the population of the frontiers\r\nand were known under the name of Cossacks. The Cossacks were therefore\r\nof great importance; being an enterprising people they were the first\r\nto lead the way to the great solitudes which they peopled. It was not\r\ndifficult for a Russian to become a Cossack; in going to the steppes he\r\ndid not enter a strange country, nor did he cease to be a Russian; there\r\namong the Cossacks he felt at home. The Cossacks who remained near the\r\nfrontier recognised the right of the Russian government over them in\r\nall things, but obeyed it only when it would prove useful to them. They\r\ndepended somewhat on the government, while those who lived far away were\r\nmore independent.”[i]\r\n\r\nPolish authors have acquainted western Europe with the name and the fact\r\nof the existence of the Cossacks. This name (in Russian _kazak_) has\r\npassed into other languages, by the writings of the seventeenth century,\r\nwith the Polish pronunciation. The etymology of this word long exercised\r\nthe sagacity of northern savants. Some derive it from the Slavonic _koza_\r\n“goat”--the Cossacks, they argued, wandered about like goats. Others\r\nbelieve it comes from _kossa_, which signifies “tress of hair,” “scythe,”\r\n“body of land projecting into a river.” Justifications are not wanting\r\nfor these different acceptations, since (1) the Cossacks were formerly\r\nin the habit of wearing long braids; (2) they used scythes to make hay,\r\nas well as in battle; (3) their first colonies were on the river banks,\r\nwhich abounded in promontories. In these days, when etymological study\r\nhas made such great progress, the word cossack is generally accepted as\r\nderived from the Turkish. In that language _cazak_ signifies marauder,\r\nplunderer, soldier of fortune. Such were in effect the first Cossacks\r\nestablished on the banks of the Dnieper and its tributaries, between the\r\nPolish, the Tatar, and the Muscovite territories. Their customs greatly\r\nresembled those of the inhabitants on the Border, or Scottish frontier;\r\nand the name of the country where they first appeared, Ukrania (Pokraina)\r\nsignifies border, frontier, in the Slavonic dialects.\r\n\r\nThe Cossacks have never formed a distinct nationality, but their manners\r\nand institutions separate them from the rest of the Russian people.\r\nThe _Cossackry_--to translate by a single word all that the Russians\r\nunderstand by _Kazatchestvo_--is the species of society, government,\r\npolitical organisation which the Russian peasant understands by instinct,\r\nso to speak, to which he conforms most easily and which he probably\r\nregards as the best. The different fractions of the Cossacks were\r\ndesignated as armies according to the provinces which they occupied.\r\nThere was the army of the Dnieper, the army of the Don, that of the\r\nIaïk (Ural), etc. Each of these armies was divided into small camps\r\nor villages, called _stanitsas_. The ground round the stanitsa, the\r\nflocks which grazed on its meadows, formed the undivided property of\r\nthe commune. At regular intervals equal partitions took place for\r\ncultivation; but each gathered the fruit of his own labour and could\r\nincrease his share in the common fund by his private industry. Every\r\nman was a soldier and bound to take up arms at the word of the chief\r\nwhom the public suffrage had designated. There was one of these for each\r\nexpedition and he bore the name of “errant captain,” _ataman kotchévoï_,\r\nwhich was distinct from the _ataman_ or political chief for life of the\r\nwhole army. This captain had under his orders an adjutant or lieutenant,\r\n_iéssaoul_, then centurions, commanders of fifties, and commanders of\r\ntens. During peace the administration of each stanitsa belonged to the\r\nelders, _startchini_; but every resolution of any importance had to be\r\nsubmitted to a discussion in which all the men of the community could\r\ntake part and vote. The political or administrative assembly was called\r\nthe circle, _kroug_. There were no written laws, the circle being the\r\nliving law, preserving and adding to the traditions. It left, moreover,\r\ncomplete liberty to the individual, so long as this was not harmful to\r\nthe community. As to the foreigner, anything, or almost anything, was\r\npermitted. Such institutions find fanatics amongst men in appearance the\r\nmost rebellious against all discipline. The filibusters at the end of the\r\nseventeenth century had similar ones.\r\n\r\nWe are ignorant of the period of the first organisation of the Cossacks;\r\nit appears, however, very probable that it is contemporary with the Tatar\r\nconquest. The little republic of the Zaparogians in the islands and on\r\nthe banks of the Dnieper seems to be the model on which the other Cossack\r\ngovernments were formed; for their dialect, the Little Russian, has left\r\ntraces amongst the Cossacks most remote from Ukraine. There is no doubt\r\nthat the first soldiers who established themselves in the islands of the\r\nDnieper were animated by patriotic and religious sentiments. Their first\r\nexploits against the Tatars and Turks were a protest of the conquered\r\nChristians against their Mussulman oppressors. In consequence of having\r\nfought for their faith they loved war for its own sake and pillage became\r\nthe principal object of their expeditions. In default of Tatars their\r\nRussian or Polish neighbours were mercilessly despoiled.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MICHAEL ROMANOV]\r\n\r\nFormerly the Cossacks had been recruited by volunteers arriving on the\r\nborders of the Dnieper--some from Great Russia, others from Lithuania or\r\nPoland. The association spread. It colonised the banks of the Don and\r\nthere instituted the rule of the stanitsas and the circle. The czars\r\nof Muscovy, while they sometimes suffered from the violence of the\r\nnewcomers, beheld, with pleasure the formation on their frontiers of an\r\narmy which fought for them, cost them nothing, and founded cities of\r\nsoldiers in desolate steppes.\r\n\r\nFrom the Don the Cossacks carried colonies along the Volga, to the\r\nTerek, to the Ural; they conquered Siberia. In 1865 descendants of\r\nthese same men were encamped at the mouths of the Amur and fringed the\r\nChinese frontier. The Don Cossacks, conquerors of a country subdued\r\nby the Tatars, submitted to Russia in 1549, but they enjoyed a real\r\nindependence. It is true that in war-time they furnished a body of troops\r\nto the czar; but war was their trade and a means of acquiring fortune.\r\nThey appointed their own atamans, governed themselves according to their\r\nown customs, and scarcely permitted the Moscow government to interfere\r\nat all in their affairs. They even claimed the right to make war without\r\ncommand of the czar, and in spite of his injunctions devoted themselves\r\nto piracy on the Black Sea and even on the Caspian Sea. In 1593, when\r\nBoris Godunov instituted serfdom in Russia, by a ukase which forbade the\r\npeasants to change their lord or their domicile, the Cossacks received\r\nimmense additions to their numbers. All those who wished to live in\r\nfreedom took refuge in a stanitsa, where they were sure of finding\r\nan asylum. In their ideas of honour, the atamans considered it their\r\nfirst duty to protect fugitives. Consequently the most usual subject of\r\ndisputes between the government of Moscow and the hordes of the Don was\r\nthe restoration of serfs. At times exacted by the czars, when they had\r\nno foreign enemy to fear, it was evaded by the atamans; at times it was\r\nin some sort forgotten, whenever the services of the Cossacks became\r\nnecessary. Practically it was considered impossible to get back a serf\r\nonce he had procured his adoption into a stanitsa.\r\n\r\nThere were always two parties among the Cossacks, which might be called\r\nthe aristocratic party and the democratic faction, although there was no\r\nnobility amongst them. The old-established Cossacks, possessing a fortune\r\nacquired either by raids or industry, did not look with a friendly\r\neye on the newcomers, who were strangers to the country. They first\r\npreached in the circle respect of treaties and obedience to the czar; the\r\nothers, on the contrary, declared themselves in favour of every violent\r\ncourse, supported those bold spirits who were meditating some hazardous\r\nexpedition, and troubled themselves little concerning the danger of\r\ncompromising the privileges of the army of the Don by abusing them. The\r\nold Cossacks in contempt called the newcomers _gole_ (nakedness, trash),\r\nand this name, like that of _gueux_ in Flanders, had ended by being borne\r\nproudly by the opposite faction.\r\n\r\nThe class of poor Cossacks, which was unceasingly recruited from\r\nfugitives, hated the Russian government and obtained the sympathy of\r\nthe serfs who dared not break their chain. The condition of the latter\r\nwas deplorable; at a time when the life of a freeman was held of small\r\naccount, a slave was less than a beast of burden and certainly more\r\nmiserable. The savagery of manners, the harshness of the masters,\r\nwas equalled only by the ferocity of the laws. One example will be\r\nenough to show what the legislation of this epoch was like. The serf\r\nwas responsible for his master’s debts. If the lord did not pay his\r\ncreditors the serf was put in prison and daily beaten before the courts\r\nof justice until the debtor had paid or the creditors had abandoned\r\ntheir claims. In their wretchedness the serfs were witnesses of the\r\nliberty of the Cossacks, who spoke the same language as themselves and\r\nwho had the same origin. We need not be astonished if, in their despair,\r\nthey were disposed to accept as their liberators the Cossacks who came\r\nto pillage their masters. A slave rarely dares to conceive the idea of\r\nconquering his liberty; but he is always ready to aid the freeman who\r\ndeclares himself his protector. Thus it is to be noted that all the\r\ngreat insurrections of serfs which broke out in Russia were organised\r\nby Cossacks. The False Dmitri, Stenka Radzin, and Pugatchev furnish the\r\nproof of this.[b]\r\n\r\n\r\nLAST YEARS OF MICHAEL\r\n\r\nThe peace with Poland being only for a stated term of years, Michael\r\nendeavoured, before its expiration, to have his troops placed in such\r\na condition by foreign officers that he might be able to reconquer the\r\ncountries ceded to the Poles. Nay, on the death of Sigismund, ere the\r\narmistice had expired, he began the attempt to recover these territories,\r\nunder the idle pretext that he had concluded a peace with Sigismund\r\nand not with his successor. But the Russian commander, Michael Schein,\r\nthe very same who had valiantly defended Smolensk with a small number\r\nof troops against the Poles, now lay two whole years indolently before\r\nthat town, with an army of fifty thousand men and provided with good\r\nartillery, and at length retreated on capitulation, a retreat for which\r\nhe and his friends were brought to answer with their heads. The Russian\r\nnation were so dissatisfied with this campaign, and the king of Sweden,\r\nwhom Michael wanted to engage in an alliance with him against the Poles,\r\nshowed so little inclination to comply, that the czar was fain to return\r\nto the former amicable relation with Poland. Peace was therefore again\r\nagreed on, and matters remained as they were before.\r\n\r\nDuring his reign, which continued till 1645, Michael had employment\r\nenough in endeavouring to heal the wounds which the spirit of faction\r\nhad inflicted on his country; to compose the disorders that had arisen;\r\nto restore the administration which had been so often disjointed and\r\nrelaxed; to give new vigour and activity to the laws, disobeyed and\r\ninefficient during the general confusions; and to communicate fresh\r\nlife to expiring commerce. It redounds greatly to his honour that he\r\nproceeded in all these respects with prudence and moderation, and brought\r\nthe disorganised machine of government again into play. More than this,\r\nthe restoration of the old order of things, was not to be expected of\r\nhim. Much that he was unable to effect was accomplished by his son and\r\nsuccessor, Alexis.\r\n\r\n\r\nALEXIS (1645-1676 A.D.)\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [1645 A.D.]]\r\n\r\nThe administration, however, of the boyar Boris Morosov, to whom Michael\r\nat his death committed the education of Alexis, then in his sixteenth\r\nyear, well-nigh destroyed the tranquillity which had so lately been\r\nrestored. Morosov trod in the footsteps of Boris Godunov, put himself,\r\nas that favourite of the czar had done, into the highest posts, and thus\r\nacquired the most extensive authority in the state, turned out all that\r\nstood in his way, distributed offices and dignities as they fell vacant\r\namong his friends and creatures, and even became, like Boris, a near\r\nrelation of the czar Alexis, by marrying a sister of the czaritza. Like\r\nhis prototype, indeed, Morosov effected much good, particularly by making\r\nthe army a main object of his concern, by strengthening the frontiers\r\nagainst Poland and Sweden, erecting manufactories for arms, taking a\r\nnumber of foreigners into pay for the better disciplining of the army,\r\nand diligently exercising the troops himself.\r\n\r\nBut these important services to the state could not render the people\r\ninsensible to the numerous acts of injustice and oppression which were\r\npractised with impunity by the party protected by this minion of the\r\nczar. The most flagrant enormities were committed, more particularly\r\nin the administration of justice. The sentence of the judge was warped\r\nto either side by presents; witnesses were to be bought; several of\r\nthe magistrates, however incredible it may seem, kept a number of\r\nscoundrels in readiness to corroborate or to oppugn, for a sum of money,\r\nwhatever they were required to confirm or to deny. Such profligates\r\nwere particularly employed in order to get rich persons into custody\r\non charges of any species of delinquency sworn against them by false\r\nwitnesses, to condemn them to death, and then to seize upon their\r\nproperty, as the accumulation of wealth seemed to be the general object\r\nof all men in office. From the same corrupt fountain flowed a multitude\r\nof monopolies and excessive taxes on the prime necessaries of life. The\r\nconsequence of all this was the oppression of the people by privileged\r\nextortioners and murmurs against injustice and the exhorbitance of\r\nimposts. In addition to this, those grandees who had now the reins of\r\ngovernment in their hands assumed a haughty, austere behaviour towards\r\nthe subjects, whereas Michael and his father had been friendly and\r\nindulgent, and their gentleness communicated itself to all who at that\r\ntime took part in the administration.\r\n\r\nFrom these several causes arose discontents in the nation; such great\r\nmen as were neglected and disappointed contributed what they could to\r\nfan these discontents, and to bring them to overt act. Moscow, the seat\r\nof the principal magistrate, who, himself in the highest degree unjust,\r\nconnived at the iniquities of his subordinate judges, was the place where\r\nthe people first applied for redress. They began by presenting petitions\r\nto the czar, implored the removal of these disorders, and exposed to him\r\nin plain terms the abuses committed by the favourite and his adherents.\r\nBut these petitions were of no avail, as none of the courtiers would\r\nventure to put them into the hand of the czar, for fear of Morosov’s long\r\narm. The populace therefore, once stopped the czar, as he was returning\r\nfrom church to his palace, calling aloud for righteous judges. Alexis\r\npromised them to make strict inquiry into their grievances, and to\r\ninflict punishment on the guilty; the people, however, had not patience\r\nto wait this tardy process, but proceeded to plunder the houses of such\r\nof the great as were most obnoxious to them. At length they were pacified\r\nonly on condition that the authors of their oppressions should be brought\r\nto condign punishment. Not, however, till they had killed the principal\r\nmagistrate, and other obnoxious persons, and forced from the czar the\r\nabolition of some of the new taxes and the death of another nefarious\r\njudge, could they be induced to spare the life of Morosov, though the\r\nczar himself entreated for him with tears. Thenceforth Morosov ceased to\r\nbe the sole adviser of his sovereign, though he continued to enjoy his\r\nfavour and affection.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: TATAR GIRL OF THE TELEUT TRIBE]\r\n\r\nSome time after these events, disturbances not less violent occurred\r\nin Pleskov and Novgorod, and were not quelled until much mischief had\r\nbeen done. The pacification of Novgorod was mainly due to the wisdom and\r\nintrepidity of the celebrated Nicon, who was afterwards patriarch.\r\n\r\nWhile the nation was in this restless and angry mood, another false\r\nDmitri thought to avail himself of an opportunity apparently so\r\nfavourable to gather a party. He was the son of a draper in the Ukraine,\r\nand was prompted to his imposture by a Polish nobleman, named Danilovski.\r\nOne day, when the young man was bathing, marks were observed on his\r\nback which were thought to resemble letters of some unknown tongue.\r\nDanilovski, hearing of this freak of nature, determined to build a plot\r\nupon it. He sent for the young man, and had the marks examined by a Greek\r\npope whom he had suborned. The pope cried out, “A miracle!” and declared\r\nthat the letters were Russian, and formed distinctly these words: Dmitri,\r\nson of the czar Dmitri. The public murder of Marina’s infant son was\r\nnotorious; but that difficulty was met by the common device of an alleged\r\nchange of children, and the Poles were invited to lend their aid to the\r\ntrue prince thus miraculously identified. They were willing enough to do\r\nso; but the trick was too stale to impose on the Russians. The impostor\r\nfound no adherents among them; and after a wretched life of vagrancy and\r\ncrime, he fell into the hands of Alexis, and was quartered alive.\r\n\r\nAlexis soon had an opportunity to repay in a more substantial manner\r\nthe ill will borne to him by the Poles, who had further offended him by\r\nrejecting him as a candidate for their throne, and electing John Casimir.\r\nThe cruel oppressions exercised by the Poles upon the Cossacks of the\r\nUkraine had roused the latter to revolt, and a furious war ensued, in\r\nwhich the enraged Cossacks avenged their wrongs in the most ruthless and\r\nindiscriminate manner. At last, after many vicissitudes, being deserted\r\nby their Tatar allies, the Cossacks appealed for aid to Alexis, offering\r\nto acknowledge him as their suzerain. With such auxiliaries the czar\r\ncould now renew with better prospects the attempt made by his father to\r\nrecover the territories wrested from Russia by her inveterate foe. He\r\ndeclared war against Poland; his conquests were rapid and numerous, and\r\nwould probably have terminated in the complete subjugation of Poland,\r\nhad he not been compelled to pause before the march of a still more\r\nsuccessful invader of that country, Charles Gustavus, king of Sweden.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [1658-1662 A.D.]]\r\n\r\nIncensed at seeing his prey thus snatched from him when he had nearly\r\nhunted it down, Alexis fell upon the king of Sweden’s own dominions\r\nduring his absence; but from this enterprise he reaped neither advantage\r\nnor credit; and he was glad to conclude, in 1658, a three years’ truce\r\nwith Sweden, and subsequently a peace, which was an exact renewal of the\r\nTreaty of Stolbova in 1617. The war in Poland ended more honourably for\r\nRussia. An armistice for thirteen years, agreed upon at Andnissov, in\r\nLithuania, and afterwards prolonged from time to time, was the forerunner\r\nof a complete pacification, which was brought to effect in 1686, and\r\nrestored to the empire Smolensk, Severia, Tchernigov, and Kiev, that\r\nprimeval principality of the Russian sovereigns. The king of Poland\r\nlikewise relinquished to the czar the supremacy he had till then asserted\r\nover the Cossacks of the Ukraine.\r\n\r\nRussia had as much need as Poland of repose; for the empire was suffering\r\nunder an accumulation of evils--an exhausted treasury, commercial\r\ndistress, pestilence and famine, all aggravated by the unwise means\r\nadopted to relieve them. To supply the place of the silver money, which\r\nhad disappeared, copper of the same nominal value was coined and put in\r\ncirculation. At first these tokens were received with confidence, and no\r\ninconvenience was experienced; but ere long the court itself destroyed\r\nthat confidence by its audacious efforts to secure to itself all the\r\nsterling money, and leave only the new coin for the use of commerce.\r\nThe cupidity displayed in transactions of this kind, especially by Ilia\r\nMiloslavski, the czar’s father-in-law, taught the public to dislike the\r\ncopper coinage; it became immensely depreciated, and extreme general\r\ndistress ensued. A rebellion broke out in consequence in Moscow (1662),\r\nand though it was speedily put down it was punished in the most atrocious\r\nmanner in the persons of thousands of wretches whose misery had driven\r\nthem to crime; whilst the authors of their woe escaped with impunity. The\r\nprisoners were hanged by hundreds, tortured, burned, mutilated, or thrown\r\nby night, with their hands bound, into the river. The number who suffered\r\ndeath in consequence of this arbitrary alteration of the currency was\r\nestimated at more than seven thousand; the tortured and maimed, at\r\nupwards of fifteen thousand.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [1665-1671 A.D.]]\r\n\r\nThe conduct of the Don Cossacks was soon such as to make it questionable\r\nwhether the acquisition of these new subjects was not rather a loss than\r\na gain to the empire. At the end of the campaign of 1665 the Cossacks\r\nwere refused permission to disband as usual and to return to their homes.\r\nThey mutinied; and several of them were punished with death. Among those\r\nwho were executed was an officer, whose brother, Stenka Radzin, had no\r\ndifficulty in rousing his countrymen to revenge this violation of their\r\nprivileges, and at the same time to gratify their insatiable appetite for\r\nhavoc and plunder.\r\n\r\nHe began his depredations on the Volga by seizing a fleet of boats\r\nbelonging to the czar, which was on its way to Astrakhan, massacring\r\npart of the crews, and pressing all the rest into his service. Having\r\ndevastated the whole country of the Volga, he descended into the Caspian,\r\nand having swept its shores, returned to the Volga laden with booty.\r\nFor three years this flagitious ruffian continued his murderous career,\r\nrepeatedly defeating the forces sent against him. At last, having lost\r\na great number of men in his piratical incursions into Persia, he\r\nwas hemmed in by the troops of the governor of Astrakhan, and forced\r\nto sue for pardon. The imperial commander thought it more prudent to\r\naccept Radzin’s voluntary submission than to risk an engagement with\r\ndesperate wretches whose numbers were still formidable. Radzin was\r\ntaken to Astrakhan, and the voyevod went to Moscow, to learn the czar’s\r\npleasure respecting him. Alexis honourably confirmed the promise made\r\nby his general in his name, and accepted Radzin’s oath of allegiance;\r\nbut instead of dispersing the pardoned rebels over regions where they\r\nwould have been useful to the empire, he had the imprudence to send them\r\nall back to the country of the Don, without despoiling them of their\r\nill-gotten wealth, or taking any other security for their good behaviour.\r\n\r\nThe brigand was soon at his old work again on the Volga, murdering and\r\ntorturing with more wanton ferocity than ever. To give to his enormities\r\nthe colour of a war on behalf of an oppressed class, he proclaimed\r\nhimself the enemy of the nobles and the restorer of the liberty of the\r\npeople. As many of the Russians still adhered to the patriarch Nicon, who\r\nhad been deposed and sent to a monastery, he spread it abroad that Nicon\r\nwas with him; that the czar’s second son (who had died at Moscow, January\r\n16th, 1670) was not dead, but had put himself under his protection; and\r\nthat he had even been requested by the czar himself to come to Moscow,\r\nand rid him of those unpatriotic grandees by whom he was unhappily\r\nsurrounded.\r\n\r\nThese artifices, together with the unlimited license to plunder which\r\nRadzin granted to everyone who joined his standard, operated so strongly\r\nthat the rebel found himself, at length, at the head of two hundred\r\nthousand men. The czar’s soldiers murdered their officers, and went\r\nover to him; Astrakhan betrayed its governor, and received him; he was\r\nmaster of the whole country of the lower Volga; and on the upper course\r\nof the river, from Nijni-Novgorod to Kazan, the peasants rose to a man\r\nand murdered their lords. Had Stenka Radzin been anything better than a\r\nvulgar robber and cut-throat, he might have revolutionised Russia; but\r\nhe was utterly without the qualities most requisite for success in such\r\nan enterprise. Disasters overtook him in the autumn of 1670: a division\r\nof his army was cut to pieces; twelve thousand of his followers were\r\ngibbeted on the high-road, and he himself was taken in the beginning of\r\nthe following year, carried to Moscow, and executed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE ANSWER OF ZAPOROGIAN COSSACKS TO SULTAN MUHAMMED IV\r\n\r\n(From the painting by Elias Repin)]\r\n\r\nThe Turks had by this time made war on Poland, and Alexis was bound by\r\nthe Treaty of Andnissov, as well as by regard for the safety of his own\r\ndominions, to support the latter power. In 1671 the Turks made themselves\r\nmasters of the important town of Kaminitz, and the Cossacks of the\r\nUkraine, ever averse to subjection, could not tell whether they belonged\r\nto Turkey, Poland, or Russia. Sultan Muhammed IV, who had subdued and\r\nlately imposed a tribute on the Poles, insisted, with all the insolence\r\nof an Ottoman and of a conqueror, that the czar should evacuate his\r\nseveral possessions in the Ukraine, but received as haughty a denial.\r\nThe sultan in his letter treated the sovereign of the Russias only as\r\na Christian _gospodin_ (hospodar), and entitled himself Most Glorious\r\nMajesty, King of the World. The czar made answer that he was above\r\nsubmitting to a Mohammedan dog, but that his sabre was as good as the\r\ngrand seignior’s scimitar.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [1676 A.D.]]\r\n\r\nAlexis sent ambassadors to the pope, and to almost all the great\r\nsovereigns in Europe, except France, which was allied to the Turks, in\r\norder to establish a league against the Porte. His ambassadors had no\r\nother success at Rome than not being obliged to kiss the pope’s toe;\r\neverywhere else they met with nothing but good wishes, the Christian\r\nprinces being generally prevented by their quarrels and jarring interests\r\nfrom uniting against the common enemy of their religion. Alexis did not\r\nlive to see the termination of the war with Turkey. His death happened in\r\n1676, in his forty-eighth year, after a reign of thirty-one years.\r\n\r\n\r\nFEODOR (1676-1682 A.D.)\r\n\r\nAlexis was succeeded by his eldest son, Feodor, a youth in his nineteenth\r\nyear, and of very feeble temperament. The most pressing task that\r\ndevolved on him was the prosecution of the war with Turkey, which, as\r\nfar as Russia was interested, had regard chiefly to the question whether\r\nthe country of the Zaparogian Cossacks should be under the sovereignty\r\nof the czar or of the sultan. The contest was terminated, three years\r\nafter Feodor’s accession, by a treaty which established his right over\r\nthe disputed territory. Only one other memorable event distinguished his\r\nbrief reign.\r\n\r\nNothing could equal the care with which the noble families kept the books\r\nof their pedigrees, in which were set down not only every one of their\r\nancestors but also the posts and offices which each had held at court, in\r\nthe army, or in the civil department. Had these genealogies and registers\r\nof descent been confined to the purpose of determining the ancestry and\r\nrelationship of families no objection could be alleged against them. But\r\nthese books of record were carried to the most absurd abuse, attended\r\nwith a host of pernicious consequences. If a nobleman were appointed to a\r\npost in the army, or at court, or to some civil station, and it appeared\r\nthat the person to whom he was now subordinate numbered fewer ancestors\r\nthan he, it was with the utmost difficulty that he could be brought to\r\naccept of the office to which he was called. Nay, this folly was carried\r\nto still greater lengths: a man would even refuse to take upon him an\r\nemploy, if thereby he would be subordinate to one whose ancestors had\r\nformerly stood in that position towards his own.\r\n\r\nIt is easy to imagine that a prejudice of this kind must have been\r\nproductive of the most disagreeable effects, and that discontents,\r\nmurmurs at slights and trifling neglects, disputes, quarrels, and\r\ndisorders in the service must have been its natural attendants. It was,\r\ntherefore, become indispensably necessary that a particular office should\r\nbe instituted at court in which exact copies of the genealogical tables\r\nand service-registers of the noble families were deposited; and this\r\noffice was incessantly employed in settling the numberless disputes that\r\narose from this inveterate prejudice. Feodor, observing the pernicious\r\neffects of this fond conceit--that the father’s capacity must necessarily\r\ndevolve on the son, and that consequently he ought to inherit his\r\nposts--wished to put a stop to it; and with the advice of his sagacious\r\nminister, Prince Vasili Galitzin, fell upon the following method. He\r\ncaused it to be proclaimed that all the families should deliver into\r\ncourt faithful copies of their service-rolls, in order that they might\r\nbe cleared of a number of errors that had crept into them. This delivery\r\nbeing made, he convoked the great men and the superior clergy before\r\nhim. In the midst of these heads of the nobles, the patriarch concluded\r\nan animated harangue by inveighing against their prerogatives. “They\r\nare,” said he, “a bitter source of every kind of evil; they render\r\nabortive the most useful enterprises, in like manner as the tares stifle\r\nthe good grain; they have introduced, even into the heart of families,\r\ndissensions, confusion, and hatred; but the pontiff comprehends the grand\r\ndesign of his czar. God alone can have inspired it!”\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [1682 A.D.]]\r\n\r\nAt these words, and by anticipation, all the grandees blindly hastened\r\nto express their approval; and, suddenly, Feodor, whom this generous\r\nunanimity seemed to enrapture, arose and proclaimed, in a simulated\r\nburst of holy enthusiasm, the abolition of all their hereditary\r\npretensions--“To extinguish even the recollection of them,” said he, “let\r\nall the papers relative to those titles be instantly consumed!” And as\r\nthe fire was ready, he ordered them to be thrown into the flames before\r\nthe dismayed eyes of the nobles, who strove to conceal their anguish by\r\ndastardly acclamations. By way of conclusion to this singular ceremony,\r\nthe patriarch pronounced an anathema against everyone who should presume\r\nto contravene this ordinance of the czar; and the justice of the sentence\r\nwas ratified by the assembly in a general shout of “Amen!” It was by\r\nno means Feodor’s intention to efface nobility; and, accordingly, he\r\nordered new books to be made, in which the noble families were inscribed;\r\nbut thus was abolished that extremely pernicious custom which made it\r\na disgrace to be under the orders of another if his ancestry did not\r\nreach so high, or even--in case of equal pedigree--if a forefather of\r\nthe commander had once been subordinate in the service to the progenitor\r\nof him who was now to acknowledge him for his superior. Feodor died\r\nin February, 1682, after a reign of five years and a half, leaving no\r\nissue.[h]\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES\r\n\r\n[37] There was no patriarch at that time.\r\n\r\n[38] Established in 1560.

PETER THE GREAT\r\n\r\n    When, towards the beginning of the eighteenth century, Peter\r\n    the Great laid the foundation of Petersburg or rather of his\r\n    empire, no one predicted success. Had anyone at that time\r\n    imagined that a sovereign of Russia could send victorious\r\n    fleets to the Dardanelles, subjugate the Crimea, drive out\r\n    the Turks from four great provinces, dominate the Black Sea,\r\n    establish the most brilliant court of Europe, and make all the\r\n    arts flourish in the midst of war--if anyone had said that he\r\n    would merely have been taken for a visionary.--VOLTAIRE.[b]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [1684-1725 A.D.]]\r\n\r\nThe question of the succession was now again thrown open to discussion,\r\nand the family feuds were revived. Ivan, the next in succession, was\r\nnearly blind, and, according to some historians, nearly dumb, and\r\ninferior in mind and body; and shortly before his death Feodor expressed\r\nhis wish that his half-brother, Peter, then between nine and ten years of\r\nage, should be nominated to the throne; a nomination of which Ivan had\r\njust sense enough to approve. The imbecility of Ivan was so great that,\r\nhad it not been for the influence of the family to which he belonged,\r\nand the bold and ambitious spirit of his sister Sophia, he must have\r\nbeen set aside at once, and Peter without further difficulty raised to\r\nthe sovereignty. The Miloflavskoi, however, were resolved to preserve\r\nthe right of succession in their own blood; and Sophia, a princess of\r\nsingular beauty and high mental endowments, in the meridian of youth\r\nand possessed of indomitable courage, set the example of contesting the\r\nthrone, first in the name of her idiot brother and next in her own name:\r\nfor when her plans were ripe she did not scruple to declare that she\r\naspired to the sceptre in the default of the rightful heir. But as all\r\nher machinations were carefully conducted with a colour of justice on\r\nbehalf of Ivan, she escaped from the charge of interested motives, which,\r\nin the early part of the plot, would have defeated her grand object.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [1684 A.D.]]\r\n\r\nWhile Sophia was employed in devising her plans, the Narishkins urged\r\nwith unabating activity the claims of Peter. Friends arose in different\r\nquarters for both parties, and the city was thrown into consternation.\r\nBut the Miloflavskoi had the advantage of possession: the keys of power\r\nwere in their hands: the officers of the state were in their immediate\r\nconfidence, and the bands of the strelitz, the janissaries of Russia,\r\nwere under their control. Sophia, availing herself of these fortunate\r\ncircumstances, pleaded with her supplicating beauty in the name of\r\nher brother; besought the strelitz, by arts of fascination which were\r\nirresistible, to make common cause with her; and where her eyes failed to\r\nimpress their sluggard hearts, she was bountiful in money and promises.\r\nA body so corrupt and slavish as the strelitz was easily won by bribes\r\nto any offices of depredation, and they accordingly declared for the\r\nbeautiful and prodigal Sophia.\r\n\r\nThe accession of fourteen thousand soldiers to her side--men who were\r\nready at any moment to deluge the capital in blood--determined the scales\r\nat once. It was necessary in the first instance to exterminate the\r\nNarishkins, the formidable supporters of Peter; and next, if it could\r\nbe accomplished with safety, to make away with the life of the prince.\r\nA rumour was accordingly disseminated that the Narishkins had compassed\r\nthe death of Feodor, in order to make room for the young Peter; that they\r\nhad poisoned him through the agency of foreign physicians; and that they\r\ncontemplated a similar act of treachery towards Ivan. The zeal of the\r\nNarishkins seemed to justify these charges; and the populace, who were\r\nuniversally in favour of the direct lineal succession, were brought to\r\nbelieve them; particularly as Galitzin, the favourite minister of Feodor,\r\nwas the chief counsellor and friend of Sophia. Affairs were now ripe for\r\nrevolt. The chiefs of the strelitz, having previously concerted their\r\nplans, broke out into open violence; and for three days in succession\r\nthis band of legalised plunderers committed the most extravagant excesses\r\nin the streets of Moscow, secretly abetted by the encouraging patronage\r\nof Sophia. In their fury they murdered all those officers of the state\r\nwhom they suspected to be inimical to the views of the princess;\r\nand bursting into the palace of the czars demanded the lives of the\r\nNarishkins. Two brothers of Natalia, the widow of Alexis, were sacrificed\r\non the spot, and sixty of her immediate kindred were shortly after put to\r\ndeath in the most cruel manner.\r\n\r\nThe czarina herself was forced to flee for safety from the capital,\r\naccompanied, providentially for the destiny of Russia, by the young\r\nprince Peter. For sixty versts she fled in consternation, carrying the\r\nboy, it is reported, in her arms: but the ferocious strelitz had tracked\r\nher footsteps, and followed close upon her path. Her strength at last\r\nbegan to fail: her pursuers were rapidly gaining on her; she could hear\r\nthe sound of their yells, and the tramp of their approaching feet: her\r\nheart trembled at the horrors of her situation, and in despair she\r\nrushed into the convent of the Trinity to seek for a last shelter in the\r\nsanctuary. The strelitz, uttering cries of savage triumph, followed on\r\nthe moment: the despairing mother had just time to gain the foot of the\r\naltar, and place the child upon it, when two of the murderous band came\r\nup. One of them seized the prince, and, raising his sword, prepared to\r\nsever the head from the body, when a noise of approaching horsemen was\r\nheard without: the ruffian hesitated--his fellow murderers at the distant\r\npart of the church were struck with terror--dismayed by the apprehension\r\nof some sudden change in the fortune of the day, he abandoned his grasp\r\nof the prince and fled, and Peter the Great was preserved to Russia.\r\n\r\nThe immediate result of those violent efforts of the strelitz was the\r\ndeclaration of the sovereignty in the name of Ivan. That prince,\r\nhowever, trembled at the prospect of incurring the responsibility of\r\na trust to which he felt himself to be unequal, and entreated his\r\ncounsellors to permit his half-brother Peter to be associated with\r\nhim in the government. This request, which was considered on all\r\nsides reasonable enough, could not be refused without increasing the\r\ndifficulties of Sophia’s party, and rendering such further measures\r\nnecessary as might probably betray her motives too soon. It was therefore\r\nsanctioned by the nobles; and on the 6th of May, 1681, the coronation\r\nof Ivan and Peter were celebrated in due form; Sophia being nominated\r\nregent, on account of the imbecility of the one and the youth of the\r\nother. Thus far Sophia had carried her purpose. She was now in possession\r\nof the power to which her ambition tempted her to aspire; but she panted\r\nto have that power formally assigned and publicly acknowledged. In order\r\nthe more effectually to exclude Peter from any future lien upon the\r\nthrone, she brought about a marriage between Ivan and a young Soltikov;\r\ntrusting to the issue for an insurmountable obstacle in the path of the\r\nprince, whose dawning genius, even at that early age, she appeared to\r\ndread.[c]\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH OF PETER\r\n\r\nDuring Sophia’s government Peter continued to reside with his mother in\r\nthe village of Preobrazhenski. His education was entirely neglected;\r\nhis teacher, Nikita Zotov, was taken away from him and not replaced by\r\nanother; he spent his time in play, surrounded by companions of his own\r\nage and without any intelligent occupation: such an existence would\r\ncertainly have spoiled and maimed a less gifted nature. Upon Peter it\r\nonly had the effect, as he himself afterwards recognised, of making him\r\nfeel in later years the want of that knowledge which is indispensable for\r\na sound education. By reason of this neglect Peter had to study much when\r\nhe reached maturity; besides this, the manner in which his boyhood was\r\nspent deprived him of that training of the character in intercourse with\r\nother people which is the mark of an educated man. From his youth Peter\r\nadopted the rough habits of those who surrounded him, an extreme want of\r\nself-restraint, and hideous debauchery.\r\n\r\nBut his unusually gifted nature could not be crushed by this absence\r\nof all intellectual interests. Peter had no early instruction, but the\r\nlove of knowledge inherent in him could not be destroyed. He himself\r\nafterwards communicated the circumstances which directed him into the\r\npaths he elected to follow. When he was fourteen years of age, he heard\r\nfrom Prince Iakov Dolgoruki that he had possessed an instrument “by means\r\nof which it was possible to measure distances or extension without being\r\non the spot.” The young czar wished to see the instrument, but Dolgoruki\r\nreplied that it had been stolen; so Peter commissioned the prince, who\r\nhad gone to France as ambassador, to purchase there for him such an\r\ninstrument. In 1688 Dolgoruki brought from France an astrolabe and case\r\nof mathematical instruments, but there was no one amongst the czar’s\r\nentourage who had any understanding of what they were for. Peter applied\r\nto a German doctor, but neither did he know how to use the instruments;\r\nfinally he found a Dutchman, Franz Timmerman, who explained to him\r\nthe significance of the objects. The czar began to study arithmetic,\r\ngeometry, and the science of fortification with him. The teacher was not\r\na great authority in these matters, but he knew sufficient to give Peter\r\nindications, and the talented pupil worked out everything himself; but\r\nhis education had been neglected to such an extent that when he was\r\nlearning the four rules of arithmetic, at the age of sixteen, he could\r\nnot write a single line correctly and did not even know how to divide\r\none word from the other, joining two or three together with continual\r\nmistakes and omissions.\r\n\r\nSome time later Peter was in the village of Izmailov, and strolling\r\nthrough the storehouses, he looked over a lot of old things that\r\nhad belonged to the cousin of the czar Michael Feodorovitch--Nikita\r\nIvanovitch Romanov, who had been distinguished in his time for his\r\nremarkable love of knowledge. Here he found a foreign-built vessel and\r\nquestioned Franz Timmerman about it; the latter could tell him only that\r\nit was an English boat, which had the superiority over Russian boats as\r\nbeing able to sail not only with the wind but also against it. Peter\r\ninquired whether there was anyone who could mend the boat and show him\r\nhow to sail it. Timmerman replied that there was and found for Peter the\r\nDutchman, Christian Brandt (Karstein Brandt, as Peter called him). The\r\nczar Alexis Michailovitch had thought of building a ship and launching\r\nit at Astrakhan, and had therefore sent for shipwrights from Holland;\r\nbut the ship that had been built and launched at Astrakhan was destroyed\r\nby Stenka Radzin, the shipwrights were dispersed, and one of them, the\r\nship’s carpenter, Karstein Brandt, lived in Moscow where he gained a\r\nliving by doing carpenter’s work.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PETER THE GREAT\r\n\r\n(1672-1725)]\r\n\r\nBy order of the czar Brandt mended the boat, put in a mast and sail,\r\nand in Peter’s presence manœuvred it on the river Iauza. Peter was\r\nastonished at such art and himself repeated the experiment several times\r\nwith Brandt, but not always successfully; it was difficult to turn the\r\nboat, which stuck to the shore because the channel was too narrow. Peter\r\nthen ordered the boat to be taken to a pond in the village of Izmailov,\r\nbut there also navigation was difficult. Then Peter learned that the\r\nlake near Pereiaslavl would be suitable for his purpose; it was thirty\r\nversts in circumference and had a depth of six sazhen.[39] Peter asked\r\nhis mother’s leave to go on a pilgrimage to the Troitsa monastery, came\r\nto Pereiaslavl, and examined the lake, which greatly pleased him. On\r\nhis return to Moscow he entreated his mother to let him go again to\r\nPereiaslavl in order to take the boat there. The czaritza could not\r\nrefuse her beloved son, although she was much against such a project out\r\nof fear for his life. Together with Brandt, Peter built a wharf at the\r\nmouth of the river Troubezh, which falls into the lake of Pereiaslavl and\r\nthus he laid the foundation of his ship building.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [1687-1689 A.D.]]\r\n\r\nAt that period Peter’s diversions with his companions began to lose\r\ntheir playful character. He enrolled amongst them volunteers of every\r\ncondition and in 1687 he formed with them two regular regiments, called\r\nby the name of the two royal villages near Moscow--the Preobrazhenski and\r\nthe Semenovski. Sophia and her partisans endeavoured to represent these\r\ndiversions as foolish extravagances; Natalia Kirillovna, the mother of\r\nPeter, did not herself see anything more in them than the amusements of\r\na spirited, impetuous youth, and thought to steady him by marriage. She\r\nfound for him a bride in the person of Eudoxia Lapoukhin, a beautiful\r\nyoung girl; her father, an _okolnitchi_, or courtier of the second rank,\r\ncalled Sarion, had his name changed to Theodore, and the marriage took\r\nplace on the 27th of January, 1689. Peter had no attachment or love for\r\nhis wife and only married to please his mother; in fact, he married\r\nas the majority of men married at that period. His mother hoped that\r\nwhen the young man was married he would begin to lead the life that was\r\nconsidered fitting for exalted personages. But soon after the marriage,\r\nas soon as the ice began to break up in the rivers, Peter galloped away\r\nto Pereiaslavl and there occupied himself with the building of ships. His\r\nmother wished to draw him away and demanded his return to Moscow under\r\nthe pretext of a requiem service for the czar Theodore: “You were pleased\r\nto summon me to Moscow,” wrote the czar to his mother, “and I was ready\r\nto come, but verily there is business on hand.” His mother insisted that\r\nhe should come to the capital; Peter obeyed and came to Moscow, but after\r\na month he was again back at the Pereiaslavl lake. He loved his mother\r\nand in his letters shared with her the satisfaction he experienced in\r\nthe success of his work. “Thanks to your prayers,” he wrote, “all is\r\nwell, and the ships are a great success.” But the czaritza Natalia did\r\nnot understand her son’s passion, and moreover feared Sophia’s inimical\r\ndesigns; therefore she called him again to Moscow. His young wife also\r\nwearied for his presence and wrote to him, calling him “her joy, her\r\nlight, her darling,” and begging him either to come back or let her come\r\nto him. Peter, recalled by his mother’s persistent demands, unwillingly\r\nreturned that summer to Moscow.[d]\r\n\r\n\r\nPETER ASSERTS CONTROL\r\n\r\nIt is alleged, with what truth we know not, that at this period Sophia\r\nand her favourite, Prince Galitzin, engaged the new chief of the Strelitz\r\nto sacrifice the young czar to their ambition. It appears at least that\r\nsix hundred of those soldiers were to seize on that prince’s person, if\r\nnot to murder him. Peter was once more obliged to take refuge in the\r\nmonastery of the Trinity, the usual sanctuary of the court when menaced\r\nby the mutinous soldiery. There he convoked the boyars of his party,\r\nassembled a body of forces, treated with the captains of the strelitz,\r\nand sent for some Germans who had been long settled in Moscow, and\r\nwere all attached to his person, from his already showing a regard to\r\nforeigners. Sophia protested her abhorrence of the plot, and sent the\r\npatriarch to her brother to assure him of her innocence; but he abandoned\r\nher cause on being shown proof that he himself was among those who had\r\nbeen marked out for assassination.\r\n\r\nPeter’s cause prevailed. All the conspirators were punished with great\r\nseverity; the leaders were beheaded, others were knouted, or had their\r\ntongues cut out, and were sent into exile. Prince Galitzin escaped with\r\nhis life, by the intercession of a relative, who was a favourite of the\r\nczar Peter, but he forfeited all his property, which was immense, and was\r\nbanished to the neighbourhood of Archangel.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SOPHIA ALEXIEVNA\r\n\r\n(1658-1704)]\r\n\r\nThe scene concluded with shutting up the Princess Sophia in a convent\r\nnear Moscow, where she remained in confinement until her death, which did\r\nnot happen until fifteen years afterwards. From that period Peter was\r\nreal sovereign. His brother Ivan had no other share in the government\r\nthan that of lending his name to the public acts. He led a retired life,\r\nand died in 1696.\r\n\r\nNature had given Peter a colossal vigour of body and mind, capable of\r\nall extremes of good and evil. It is impossible to review his whole\r\nhistory without mingled feelings of admiration, horror, and disgust.\r\nThat he was not altogether a monster of wickedness was not the fault of\r\nSophia and her minister, whose deliberate purpose it was to destroy in\r\nhim every germ of good, that he might become odious and insupportable to\r\nthe nation. They succeeded only in impairing the health, corrupting the\r\nmorals, and hardening the heart of the youthful czar; it was no more in\r\ntheir power to deprive him of his lofty nature than to have given it to\r\nhim. General Menesius, a learned Scotchman, to whom Alexis had intrusted\r\nhis education, refused to betray him, and was, therefore, driven from\r\nhis charge. The first impressions on the mind of Peter were allowed to\r\nbe received from coarse and sordid amusements, and from foreigners, who\r\nwere repulsed by the jealousy of the boyars, hated by the superstition of\r\nthe people, and despised by the general ignorance. Thus it was hoped that\r\nhe would at last be driven by public execration to quit the palace for a\r\nmonk’s cell; but to ensure his disgrace served to lay the foundations of\r\nhis greatness and glory.\r\n\r\nKept at a distance from the throne, Peter escaped the influence of that\r\natmosphere of effeminacy and flattery by which it is environed; the\r\nhatred with which he was inspired against the destroyers of his family\r\nincreased the energy of his character. He knew that he must conquer his\r\nplace upon the throne, which was held by an able and ambitious sister,\r\nand encircled by a barbarous soldiery; thenceforth, his childhood had\r\nthat which ripened age too often wants, it had an aim in view, of which\r\nhis genius, already bold and persevering, had a thorough comprehension.\r\nSurrounded by adventurers of daring spirits, who had come from afar\r\nto try their fortune, his powers were rapidly unfolded. One of them,\r\nLefort, who doubtless perceived in this young barbarian the traces of\r\ncivilisation, which had perhaps been left there by his first tutor, gave\r\nhim an idea of the sciences and arts of Europe, and particularly of the\r\nmilitary art.\r\n\r\n\r\nMILITARY REFORMS\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [1692-1695 A.D.]]\r\n\r\nLefort, in whom Peter placed his whole confidence, did not understand\r\nmuch of the military service, neither was he a man of literature, having\r\napplied himself deeply to no one particular art or science; but he had\r\nseen a great deal, and was capable of forming a right judgment of what\r\nhe saw. Like the czar, he was indebted for everything to his own genius:\r\nbesides, he understood the German and Dutch languages, which Peter was\r\nlearning at that time, in hopes that both those nations would facilitate\r\nhis designs. Finding himself agreeable to Peter, Lefort attached himself\r\nto that prince’s service: by administering to his pleasures he became\r\nhis favourite, and confirmed this intimacy by his abilities. The czar\r\nintrusted him with the most dangerous design a Russian sovereign could\r\nthen possibly form--that of abolishing the seditious and barbarous body\r\nof the strelitz. The attempt to reform the janissaries had cost the great\r\nsultan Osman his life. Peter, young as he was, went to work in a much\r\nabler manner than Osman. He began with forming, at his country residence\r\nof Preobrajen, a company of fifty of his youngest domestics; and some\r\nof the sons of boyars were chosen for their officers. But in order to\r\nteach those young boyars a subordination with which they were wholly\r\nunacquainted, he made them pass through all the military degrees, setting\r\nthem an example himself, and serving successively as private soldier,\r\nsergeant, and lieutenant of the company.\r\n\r\nThis company, which had been raised by Peter only, soon increased in\r\nnumbers, and was afterwards the regiment of Preobrajenski guards. Another\r\ncompany, formed on the same plan, became in time the regiment of guards\r\nknown by the name of Semenovski. The czar had now a regiment of five\r\nthousand men on foot, on whom he could depend, trained by General Gordon,\r\na Scotchman, and composed almost entirely of foreigners. Lefort, who had\r\nseen very little service, yet was qualified for any commission, undertook\r\nto raise a regiment of twelve thousand men, and effected his design. Five\r\ncolonels were appointed to serve under him; and suddenly he was made\r\ngeneral of this little army, which had been raised as much to oppose the\r\nstrelitz as the enemies of the state.\r\n\r\nPeter was desirous of seeing one of those mock fights which had been\r\nlately introduced in times of peace. He caused a fort to be erected,\r\nwhich one part of his new troops was to defend and the other to attack.\r\nThe difference on this occasion was that, instead of exhibiting a sham\r\nengagement, they fought a downright battle, in which there were several\r\nsoldiers killed and a great many wounded. Lefort, who commanded the\r\nattack, received a considerable wound. These bloody sports were intended\r\nto inure the troops to martial discipline; but it was a long time\r\nbefore this could be effected, and not without a great deal of labour\r\nand difficulty. Amidst these military entertainments, the czar did not\r\nneglect the navy: and as he had made Lefort a general, notwithstanding\r\nthis favourite had never borne any commission by land, so he raised him\r\nto the rank of admiral, though he had never before commanded at sea. But\r\nhe knew him to be worthy of both commissions. True, he was an admiral\r\nwithout a fleet, and a general without any other troops than his regiment.\r\n\r\nBy degrees the czar began to reform the chief abuse in the army, viz.,\r\nthe independence of the boyars, who, in time of war, used to take the\r\nfield with a multitude of their vassals and peasants. Such was the\r\ngovernment of the Franks, Huns, Goths, and Vandals, who, indeed, subdued\r\nthe Roman Empire in its state of decline, but would have been easily\r\ndestroyed had they contended with the warlike legions of the ancient\r\nRomans, or with such armies as in our times are maintained in constant\r\ndiscipline all over Europe.\r\n\r\nAdmiral Lefort had soon more than an empty title. He employed both Dutch\r\nand Venetian carpenters to build some long-boats, and even two thirty-gun\r\nships, at the mouth of the Voroneje, which discharges itself into the\r\nDon. These vessels were to fall down the river, and to awe the Crim\r\nTatars. Turkey, too, seemed to invite the czar to essay his arms against\r\nher; at the same time disputes were pending with China respecting the\r\nlimits between that empire and the possessions of Russia in the north of\r\nAsia. These, however, were settled by a treaty concluded in 1692, and\r\nPeter was left free to pursue his designs of conquest on the European\r\nside of his dominions.\r\n\r\n\r\nAZOV TAKEN FROM THE TURKS\r\n\r\nIt was not so easy to settle a peace with the Turks; this even seemed a\r\nproper time for the czar to raise himself on their ruin. The Venetians,\r\nwhom they had long overpowered, began to retrieve their losses. Morosini,\r\nthe same who surrendered Candia to the Turks, was dispossessing them of\r\nthe Morea. Leopold, emperor of Germany, had gained some advantages over\r\nthe Ottoman forces in Hungary; and the Poles were at least able to repel\r\nthe incursions of the Crim Tatars.\r\n\r\nPeter profited by these circumstances to discipline his troops, and to\r\nacquire, if possible, the empire of the Black Sea. General Gordon marched\r\nalong the Don towards Azov, with his regiment of five thousand men; he\r\nwas followed by General Lefort, with his regiment of twelve thousand;\r\nby a body of strelitz, under the command of Sheremetrev and Schein,\r\nofficers of Prussian extraction; by a body of Cossacks, and a large train\r\nof artillery. In short everything was ready for this grand expedition\r\n(1694). The Russian army began its march under the command of Marshal\r\nSheremetrev; in the beginning of the summer of 1695, in order to attack\r\nthe town of Azov, situated at the mouth of the Don. The czar was with the\r\ntroops, but appeared only as a volunteer, being desirous to learn before\r\nhe would take upon him to command. During their march they stormed two\r\nforts which the Turks had erected on the banks of the river.\r\n\r\nThis was an arduous enterprise, Azov being very strong and defended by a\r\nnumerous garrison. The czar had employed several Venetians in building\r\nlong-boats like the Turkish saicks, which, together with two Dutch\r\nfrigates, were to fall down the Voroneje; but not being ready in time,\r\nthey could not get into the sea of Azov. All beginnings are difficult.\r\nThe Russians, having never as yet made a regular siege, miscarried in\r\nthis their first attempt.\r\n\r\nA native of Dantzic, whose name was Jacob, had the direction of the\r\nartillery under the command of General Schein; for as yet they had none\r\nbut foreign officers belonging to the train, and indeed none but foreign\r\nengineers and foreign pilots. This Jacob had been condemned to the rods\r\nby Schein, the Prussian general. It seemed as if these severities were\r\nnecessary at that time in support of authority. The Russians submitted\r\nto such treatment, notwithstanding their disposition to mutiny; and\r\nafter they had undergone that corporal punishment, they continued in the\r\nservice as usual. This Dantziker was of another way of thinking, and\r\ndetermined to be revenged; whereupon he spiked the cannon, deserted to\r\nthe enemy, turned Mohammedan, and defended the town with great success.\r\nThe besiegers made a vain attempt to storm it, and after losing a great\r\nnumber of men, were obliged to raise the siege.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [1696 A.D.]]\r\n\r\nPerseverance in his undertakings was the characteristic of Peter the\r\nGreat. In the spring of 1696 he marched a second time to attack the town\r\nof Azov with a more considerable army. The most agreeable part of the\r\nczar’s success was that of his little fleet, which he had the pleasure\r\nto see completely equipped and properly commanded. It beat the Turkish\r\nsaicks that had been sent from Constantinople, and took some of them. The\r\nsiege was carried on regularly, though not entirely after the English\r\nmanner. The trenches were three times deeper than the English, and the\r\nparapets were as high as ramparts. At length the garrison surrendered,\r\nthe 28th of July, 1696, without obtaining any of the honours of war; they\r\nwere likewise obliged to deliver up the traitor Jacob to the besiegers.\r\n\r\nThe czar immediately began to improve the fortifications of Azov. He\r\nlikewise ordered a harbour to be dug, capable of holding large vessels,\r\nwith a design to make himself master of the straits of Caffa, which open\r\nthe passage into the Black Sea. He left two-and-thirty armed saicks\r\nbefore Azov, and made all the preparations for fitting out a strong\r\nfleet against the Turks, which was to consist of nine sixty-gun ships,\r\nand of one-and-forty carrying from thirty to fifty pieces of cannon.\r\nThe principal nobility and the wealthiest merchants were obliged to\r\ncontribute to the fitting out of this fleet; and, as he thought that the\r\nestates of the clergy ought to bear a proportion in the service of the\r\ncommon cause, orders were issued that the patriarch, the bishops, and\r\nthe superior clergy should find money to forward this new expedition, in\r\nhonour of their country, and for the general advantage of Christendom.\r\nHe likewise obliged the Cossacks to build a number of light boats, such\r\nas they use themselves, with which they might easily infest the whole\r\ncoast of the Crimea. The scheme was to drive the Tatars and Turks forever\r\nout of the Crimea, and afterwards to establish a free and easy commerce\r\nwith Persia, through Georgia. This is the very branch of trade which\r\nthe Greeks formerly carried on to Colchis, and to this peninsula of the\r\nCrimea, which the czar seemed likely to subdue.\r\n\r\nBefore Peter left the Crimea he repudiated his wife Eudoxia, and ordered\r\nher to be sent to a convent, where, before his return to Moscow, she\r\nbecame a nun, under the name of Helena. She had long made herself\r\ndistasteful to her husband by her querulous jealousy, for which, indeed,\r\nshe had ample cause, and by her aversion to his foreign favourites and\r\nthe arts they introduced.\r\n\r\nAfter his successful campaign against the Turks and Tatars, Peter wished\r\nto accustom his people to splendid shows, as well as to military toil.\r\nWith this view, he made his army enter Moscow under triumphal arches,\r\nin the midst of fireworks and other tokens of rejoicing. The soldiers\r\nwho had fought on board the Venetian saicks against the Turks led the\r\nprocession. Marshal Sheremetrev, generals Gordon and Schein, Admiral\r\nLefort, and the other general officers, took precedence of their\r\nsovereign, who pretended he had no rank in the army, being desirous to\r\nconvince the nobility by his example that merit ought to be the only road\r\nto military preferment.\r\n\r\nThis triumphal entry seemed, in some measure, to resemble those of the\r\nancient Romans, especially in that as the triumphers exposed the captives\r\nto public view in the streets of Rome, and sometimes put them to death,\r\nso the slaves taken in this expedition followed the army; and Jacob,\r\nwho had betrayed them the year before, was carried in a cart, with the\r\ngibbet, to which he was fastened after he had been broken upon the wheel.\r\n\r\nUpon this occasion was struck the first medal in Russia. The legend,\r\nwhich was in the language of that country is remarkable: “Peter I, the\r\naugust emperor of Muscovy.” On the reverse is Azov, with these words,\r\n“Victorious by fire and water.”\r\n\r\n\r\nSCHEMES OF CONQUEST\r\n\r\nThe paramount idea of Peter’s whole life displayed itself in the siege of\r\nAzov, his first military enterprise. He wished to civilise his people by\r\nbeginning with the art of war by sea and land. That art would open the\r\nway for all the others into Russia, and protect them there. By it the\r\nczar was to conquer for his empire that element which, in his eyes, was\r\nthe greatest civiliser of the world, because it is the most favourable to\r\nthe intercourse of nations with each other.\r\n\r\nBut ignorant and savage Asia lay stretched along the Black Sea, between\r\nRussia and the south of Europe. It was not, therefore, through those\r\nwaters that Peter could open himself a passage to European knowledge.\r\nBut towards the northwest, another sea, the same whence, in the ninth\r\ncentury, came the first Russian founders of the empire, was within\r\nhis reach. It alone could connect Muscovy with ancient Europe; it\r\nwas especially through that inlet, and by the ports on the gulfs of\r\nFinland and of Riga, that Russia could aspire to civilisation. Those\r\nports belonged, however, to a warlike land, thickly studded with strong\r\nfortresses. It mattered not; everything was to be tried to attain so\r\nimportant an object.\r\n\r\nPeter, however, did not deem it proper to begin such an arduous\r\nenterprise until he should have made himself better acquainted with the\r\nnations which he wished to conciliate, or to conquer, and which were\r\nrecommended to him as models. He was desirous, with his own eyes, of\r\nbeholding civilisation in what he supposed to be its mature state, and to\r\nimprove himself in the details of government, in the knowledge of naval\r\naffairs, and of the several arts which he wished to introduce among his\r\ncountrymen.\r\n\r\n\r\nCONSPIRACY TO MURDER PETER\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [1697 A.D.]]\r\n\r\nBut he was not allowed to depart in peace. The announcement of his\r\nintention was received with deep disgust by his bigoted subjects. The\r\nstrelitz in particular, who saw themselves supplanted by the regiments\r\ndisciplined in the European manner, were actively hostile. The childhood\r\nand youth of Peter had several times escaped from their rage; and now,\r\nin the horror which was inspired by his approaching departure for\r\nprofane Europe, they determined to sacrifice the impious czar who was\r\nready to defile himself by the sacrilegious touch of foreigners whom\r\nthey abhorred. They saw in the midst of them twelve thousand heretics,\r\nalready organised, who would remain masters of their holy city; while\r\nthey themselves, exiled to the army, were destined to fight at a distance\r\non the frontier. Nor was this their only grievance, for Peter had given\r\norders to construct a fleet of a hundred vessels; and of this sudden\r\ncreation they complained, as being an insupportable tax in the midst of\r\nan already ruinous war, and as rendering it necessary to introduce into\r\ntheir sacred land a fresh supply of those schismatical artisans who were\r\npreferred to them. A few days before the departure of their sovereign,\r\nTsikler and Sukanim, two of the strelitz leaders, plotted a nocturnal\r\nconflagration. They knew that Peter would be the first to hasten to it;\r\nand in the midst of the tumult and confusion common to such accidents,\r\nthey meant to murder him without mercy, and then to massacre all the\r\nforeigners who had been set over them as masters.\r\n\r\nSuch was the infamous scheme. The hour fixed for its accomplishment\r\nwas at hand. The principal conspirators assembled at a banquet, and\r\nsought in intoxicating liquors the courage requisite for the dreadful\r\nwork before them. But drunkenness produces various effects on different\r\nconstitutions. Two of the villains lost in it their boldness, left the\r\ncompany under a specious pretext, promising their accomplices to return\r\nin time, and hurried to the czar to disclose the plot.\r\n\r\nAt midnight the blow was to have been struck; and Peter gave orders\r\nthat, exactly at eleven, the haunt of the conspirators should be closely\r\nsurrounded. Shortly after, thinking that the hour was come, he went\r\nthither alone, and entered boldly, not doubting that he should find\r\nthem already fettered by his guards. But his impatience had anticipated\r\nthe time, and he found himself, single and unarmed, in the midst of the\r\nferocious gang at the instant when they were vociferating an oath that\r\nthey would achieve his destruction.\r\n\r\nAt his unexpected appearance they all rose in confusion. Peter, at once\r\ncomprehending the full extent of his danger, exasperated at the supposed\r\ndisobedience of his guards, and furious at having thrown himself into\r\nperil, had yet the presence of mind to conceal his emotions. Having\r\ngone too far to recede, he unhesitatingly advanced among the throng of\r\ntraitors, greeted them familiarly, and, in a calm and natural tone, said,\r\nthat “as he was passing by their house he saw a light in it, and guessing\r\nthat they were amusing themselves, he had entered in order to share their\r\npleasures.” He then seated himself, and drank to his assassins, who,\r\nstanding up around him, could not avoid putting the glass about, and\r\ndrinking his health.\r\n\r\nBut they soon began to exchange looks and signs. At last one of them\r\nleaned over to Sukanim, and said, in a low voice, “Brother, it is time!”\r\nThe latter, for what reason is unknown, hesitated, and had scarcely\r\nreplied, “Not yet,” when Peter, who heard these words, and along with\r\nthem the footsteps of his guards, started from his seat, knocked him down\r\nby a blow in the face, and exclaimed, “If it is not yet time for you,\r\nscoundrel, it is for me!” This blow, and the sight of the guards, threw\r\nthe assassins into consternation; they fell on their knees and implored\r\nforgiveness. “Chain them!” replied the terrible czar. Then turning to\r\nthe officer of the guards, he struck him, and reproached him with his\r\nwant of punctuality; but the latter showed him his order; and the czar\r\nperceiving his mistake, clasped him in his arms, kissed him on the\r\nforehead, proclaimed his fidelity, and entrusted him with the custody of\r\nthe traitors.\r\n\r\nHis vengeance was terrible; the punishment was more ferocious than the\r\ncrime. First the rack, then the successive mutilation of each member;\r\nthen death, when not enough of blood and life was left to allow of the\r\nsense of suffering. To close the whole, the heads were exposed on the\r\nsummit of a column, the members being symmetrically arranged around them,\r\nas ornaments--a scene worthy of a government of masters and of slaves,\r\nbrutifying each other, whose only god was fear.\r\n\r\n\r\nPETER TRAVELS TO ACQUIRE KNOWLEDGE\r\n\r\nAfter this terrific execution, Peter began his journey in April, 1697,\r\ntravelling incognito in the retinue of his three ambassadors, General\r\nLefort, the boyar Alexis Golovin, and Vonitsin, _diak_, or secretary\r\nof state, who had been long employed in foreign courts. Their retinue\r\nconsisted of two hundred persons. The czar, reserving to himself only\r\na _valet de chambre_, a servant in livery, and a dwarf, was confounded\r\nin the crowd. It was a thing unparalleled in history, either ancient or\r\nmodern, for a sovereign of five-and-twenty years of age to withdraw from\r\nhis kingdoms, only in order to learn the art of government. His victory\r\nover the Turks and Tatars, the splendour of his triumphant entry into\r\nMoscow, the multitude of foreign troops attached to his interest, the\r\ndeath of his brother Ivan, the confinement of the princess Sophia to a\r\ncloister, and the fearful example he had just made of the conspirators\r\nmight naturally encourage him to hope that the tranquillity of his\r\ndominions would not be disturbed during his absence. The regency he\r\nentrusted to the boyar Strecknev and Prince Romadonovski, who in matters\r\nof importance were to consult with the rest of the nobility.\r\n\r\nThe troops which had been trained by General Gordon continued at Moscow,\r\nwith a view to awe the capital. The disaffected strelitz, who were likely\r\nto create a disturbance, were distributed on the frontiers of the Crimea,\r\nin order to preserve the conquest of Azov and check the incursions of\r\nthe Tatars. Having thus provided against every contingency, he gave a\r\nfree scope to his passion for travelling, and his desire of improvement.\r\nHe had previously sent threescore young Russians of Lefort’s regiment\r\ninto Italy, most of them to Venice and the rest to Leghorn, in order to\r\nlearn the art of navigation and the method of constructing galleys: forty\r\nmore set out by his direction for Holland, to be instructed in the art\r\nof building and working large ships: others were ordered to Germany, to\r\nserve in the land forces and to learn the military discipline of that\r\nnation.\r\n\r\nAt that period, Mustapha II had been vanquished by the emperor Leopold;\r\nSobieski was dead; and Poland was hesitating in its choice between the\r\nprince of Conti and Augustus of Saxony; William III reigned over England;\r\nLouis XIV was on the point of concluding the Treaty of Ryswick; the\r\nelector of Brandenburg was aspiring to the title of king; and Charles XII\r\nhad ascended the throne.\r\n\r\nSetting out from Novgorod, Peter first visited Livonia, where, at the\r\nrisk of his liberty, he reconnoitred its capital, Riga, from which he was\r\nrudely repulsed by the Swedish governor. Thenceforth he could not rest\r\ntill he had acquired that maritime province through which his empire was\r\none day to be enriched and enlightened. In his progress he gained the\r\nfriendship of Prussia, a power which, at a future time, might assist his\r\nefforts; Poland ought to be his ally, and already he declared himself the\r\nsupporter of the Saxon prince who was about to rule it.\r\n\r\nThe czar had reached Amsterdam fifteen days before the ambassadors. He\r\nlodged at first in a house belonging to the East India Company, but chose\r\nafterwards a small apartment in the yards of the admiralty. He disguised\r\nhimself in a Dutch skipper’s habit, and went to the great ship-building\r\nvillage of Zaandam. Peter admired the multitude of workmen constantly\r\nemployed; the order and exactness observed in their several departments;\r\nthe prodigious despatch with which they built and fitted out ships;\r\nand the vast quantity of stores and machines for the greater ease and\r\nsecurity of labour. He began with purchasing a boat, and made a mast\r\nfor it himself. By degrees he executed every part of the construction\r\nof a ship, and led the same life all the time as the carpenters of\r\nZaandam--clad and fed exactly like them; working hard at the forges, at\r\nthe rope-yards, and at the several mills for sawing timber, extracting\r\noil, manufacturing paper, and wire-drawing. He entered himself as a\r\ncommon carpenter, and was enrolled in the list of workmen by the name\r\nof Peter Michaelov. They commonly called him Master Peter, or Peter-bas;\r\nand though they were confounded at first to behold a sovereign as their\r\ncompanion, yet they gradually accustomed themselves to the sight.\r\n\r\nWhilst Peter was handling the compass and axe at Zaandam, he received\r\nintelligence of the division in Poland, and of the double nomination of\r\nthe elector Augustus and the prince of Conti. Immediately the carpenter\r\nof Zaandam promised King Augustus to assist him with thirty thousand men.\r\nFrom his shop he issued orders to his army in the Ukraine, which had been\r\nassembled against the Turks.\r\n\r\nHis troops obtained a victory over the Tatars, in the neighbourhood of\r\nAzov; and a few months after became masters of the town of Orkapi, or\r\nPerekop. For his part he persisted in making himself master of different\r\narts. With this view he frequently went from Zaandam to Amsterdam, in\r\norder to hear the anatomical lectures of the celebrated Ruisch. Under\r\nthis master he made such progress as to be able to perform some surgical\r\noperations, which, in case of necessity, might be of use, both to himself\r\nand to his officers. He likewise studied natural philosophy, under\r\nVitsen, celebrated for his patriotic virtue and for the noble use he made\r\nof his immense fortune.[e]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Peter in Holland, England, and Austria_\r\n\r\nBesides ship-building Peter also turned his attention to machinery,\r\nfactories, and industry of every kind. Sometimes he was to be found\r\nsitting at the weaver’s loom, sometimes handling the sledge-hammer, axe,\r\nand plane. He could truthfully write to the patriarch Adrian concerning\r\nhimself: “We act obedient to the word of God to our first parent Adam and\r\nare working--not because it is necessary, but in order that we may have a\r\nbetter insight into naval affairs and be the more able to go against the\r\nenemies of Jesus Christ’s name and conquer by his grace.”\r\n\r\nOn the 9th of September Peter, accompanied by Vitsen and Lefort,\r\njourneyed to Utrecht for a conference with the hereditary stadholder\r\nWilliam of Orange, king of England. On his return he visited the\r\nwhale-fishing fleet which had shortly before arrived, so as to become\r\nacquainted with everything concerning whale-fishing--that important\r\nbranch of the seaman’s activity.\r\n\r\nPeter always took note of everything new and important that he saw.\r\nVitsen had to take him everywhere--to the hospitals, the foundling\r\nasylums, and the prayer meetings of different religious sects. He found\r\ngreat pleasure in the anatomical cabinet of the celebrated Ruisch, who\r\nhad greatly advanced the art of preserving corpses from decomposition\r\nby injections. It was with difficulty that the czar could be got out of\r\nthe room. He stood there transfixed and as it were unconscious, and he\r\ncould not pass before the body of a child, that seemed to smile as if it\r\nwere alive, without kissing it. His taste for being present at surgical\r\noperations went so far that at his request a special door was made in the\r\nwall of the St. Peter Hospital, by which he could enter it with Ruisch\r\nfrom the embassy, unobserved and unmolested by the curious. It was this\r\ndoctor who recommended to him the surgeons for the new Russian naval and\r\nmilitary troops.\r\n\r\nAfter a stay of two months the Russian embassy went to the Hague, where\r\nit had long been expected. The entry was even more magnificent than at\r\nAmsterdam. Peter wished to attend the formal audience of his embassy in\r\nstrict incognito. Vitsen, accompanied by two gentlemen, fetched him in\r\nhis carriage. The czar wished to take along his dwarf, and when told\r\nthat space was lacking, he replied: “Very well, then, he will sit on my\r\nlap.” At his command a drive was taken outside the town. At every one of\r\nthe many mills that he passed, he asked what it was for; and on being\r\ntold that one before which there were no stores was a grinding-mill, he\r\njumped out of the carriage, but it was locked. On the road to Haarlem\r\nhe observed a small water-mill for irrigating the land. It was in vain\r\nthat they told him it was encompassed by water. “I must see it,” was\r\nthe reply. The czar satisfied his curiosity and returned with wet feet.\r\nTwilight was already setting in, and the Dutch escort of the czar were\r\nrejoicing that the sight-seeing was at an end. But alas! before entering\r\nthe Hague, Peter felt the carriage give a sharp jolt. “What is it?” he\r\ninquired. He was told that the carriage had driven on to a ferry-boat. “I\r\nmust see it,” said he, and by lantern light the width, length, and depth\r\nof the ferry-boat had to be taken. Finally, at eleven at night, one of\r\nthe best hotels in the Hague was reached. The czar was given a beautiful\r\nbedroom with a four-post bed. He preferred a garret. After midnight it\r\noccurred to him to spend the night at the hotel where his ambassadors\r\nwere. Looking there for a place to sleep in, he found a Russian servant\r\nsnoring on a bear skin. With a few kicks he awakened him. “Go away, go\r\naway, I am going to sleep here.” At last he found a comfortable resting\r\nplace.\r\n\r\nOn the day of the audience, Peter dressed himself as an ordinary nobleman\r\nin a blue garment not overladen with gold lace, a large blond wig, and\r\na hat with white feathers. Vitsen led him to the anteroom of a hall\r\nwhere soon the members of the states general and many distinguished\r\nspectators assembled. As some time passed before the retinue of his\r\nembassy arrived, and meanwhile all eyes in the hall were turned towards\r\nthe ante-chamber where the czar was, he became extremely restless. “It\r\ntakes too long,” he said and wanted to depart. But Vitsen represented to\r\nhim that he would have to pass through the hall where the states general\r\nwere already assembled. Thereupon he demanded that the lords should turn\r\ntheir backs to him as he passed through the room. Vitsen replied that\r\nhe could command the lords nothing, as they were the representatives\r\nof the sovereignty of the land, but that he would ask them. The reply\r\nbrought back was that the lords would stand up as the czar passed through\r\nthe room, but would not turn their backs. Peter then drew his great wig\r\nbefore his face and ran at full speed through the assembly room and down\r\nthe porch.\r\n\r\nIn the Hague also Peter had several informal meetings with the\r\nstadholder, King William; he became personally acquainted with the\r\neminent statesmen Heinsius, Van Slingerland, Van Welde, Van Haven, and\r\nwith the recorder of the states general, Franz Flagel. He besought the\r\nlatter to find him someone who would know how to organise the Russian\r\nchancellery on the Dutch model. He also entered into connection with the\r\ncelebrated engineer, General Coehorn, and on his recommendation took many\r\nDutch engineering officers into the Russian service.\r\n\r\nAs Peter next undertook a journey to Leyden, the great scientist\r\nLeeuwenhoek had to come on board his yacht. He brought some of his most\r\nbeautiful apparatus and a microscope with him. Peter conversed with him\r\nfor two hours, and manifested much pleasure in the observation of the\r\ncirculation of the blood in fishes. Boerhaave took him to the Botanical\r\nGardens and to the anatomical lecture-room. On observing that one of\r\nhis suite could not hide his aversion for a body which seemed to him\r\nparticularly worthy of observation on account of its exposed sinews, he\r\nordered him to tear out one of these sinews with his teeth.\r\n\r\nFrom Leyden, Peter returned to Amsterdam. Here he often joined in the\r\nwork on the galley which had been commenced at his request. In the name\r\nof the town Vitsen requested the czar to accept this ship as a present.\r\nPeter gave it the name _Amsterdam_, and in the following year, laden\r\nwith wares bought by Peter himself, it started on its first journey to\r\nArchangel. From Amsterdam Peter often made excursions to Zaandam, ever\r\nkeen and confident, although his Russian attendants trembled and quaked\r\nat the threatening dangers. On market days he was greatly entertained\r\nby the quacks and tooth drawers. He had one of the latter brought to\r\nhim, and with great dexterity soon acquired the knack necessary for\r\nthis profession. His servants had to provide him with opportunities for\r\npractising the newly acquired art.\r\n\r\nThrough Vitsen the Dutch Jews petitioned the czar to permit their nation,\r\nwhich had been banished by Ivan IV from Russia, to re-enter it, and they\r\noffered to prove their gratitude by a present of 100,000 gulden. “My good\r\nVitsen,” replied Peter, “you know my nation and that it is not yet the\r\ntime to grant the Jews this request. Tell them in my name that I thank\r\nthem for their offer, but that their condition would become pitiable\r\nif they settled in Russia, for although they have the reputation of\r\nswindling all the world in buying and selling, I am afraid they would be\r\ngreatly the losers by my Russians.”\r\n\r\nDuring his sojourn in Amsterdam Peter received the joyful news of\r\ntwo successful engagements against the Tatars in July and August. To\r\ncelebrate this victory he gave a brilliant fête to the authorities and\r\nmerchants of the town. The brilliant victory of Prince Eugene at Zenta\r\nwas yet more decisive for the issue of the war against the Turks.\r\n\r\nOn the 9th of November Peter, accompanied only by Lefort, returned to the\r\nHague, where he informed King William III of his desire to see England.\r\nThe king preceded him, and sent three men of war and a yacht under the\r\ncommand of Admiral Mitchel to conduct the czar. On the 18th of January,\r\n1698, accompanied by Menshikov and fifteen other Russians of his suite,\r\nhe set sail at Hellevoetsluis. Soon after the first days of his arrival\r\nin England, he exchanged the dwelling assigned to him in the royal castle\r\nof Somerset for the house of Mr. Evelyn at Deptford in the neighbourhood\r\nof the admiralty works, whence he could enter the royal construction\r\nyards unseen. There he learned from the master builders how to draw\r\nup the plan according to which a ship must be built. He found extreme\r\npleasure in observing the cannon at the Tower, and also the mint, which\r\nthen excelled all others in the art of stamping.\r\n\r\nIn his honour Admiral Carmarthen instituted a sham sea fight at Spithead\r\non the 3rd of April which was conducted on a greater scale than a similar\r\nspectacle given for him in Holland. He often visited the great cathedrals\r\nand churches. He paid great attention to the ceremonial of English\r\nchurch worship; he also visited the meeting-houses of the Quakers and\r\nother sects. At Oxford he had the organisation and institutions of the\r\nuniversity shown him. As in Holland, he preferred to pass most of his\r\ntime with handicraftsmen and artists of every kind; from the watchmaker\r\nto the coffin maker, all had to show him their work, and he took models\r\nwith him to Russia of all the best and newest. During his stay he always\r\ndressed either as an English gentleman or in a naval uniform.\r\n\r\nIn Holland the English merchants had presented the czar with a memorial\r\nthrough Count Pembroke on the 3rd of November, 1697, in which they had\r\npetitioned for permission to import tobacco (which had been so strongly\r\nforbidden under the czars Michael and Alexis), and offered to pay a\r\nconsiderable sum of money for the privilege. The marquis of Carmarthen\r\nnow again broached the subject, and on the 16th of April a treaty was\r\nsigned with the Russian ambassador Golovin for three years, which\r\nauthorised Carmarthen’s agents to import into the Russian Empire in the\r\nfirst year three thousand hogsheads (of five hundred English pounds\r\neach), and in each of the following two years four thousand hogsheads,\r\nagainst a tax of 4 kopecks in the pound. Twelve thousand pounds were paid\r\ndown in advance. This money placed the czar in a position to make still\r\ngreater purchases, as well as to engage a greater number of foreigners\r\nin his service; amongst them the astronomer and professor of mathematics\r\nFerguson of Scotland, the engineer Captain Perry, and the shipbuilders\r\nJohn Dean and Joseph Ney.[f]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [1698 A.D.]]\r\n\r\nKing William made Peter a present of the _Royal Transport_, a very\r\nbeautiful yacht, which he generally used for his passage over to\r\nHolland. Peter went on board this vessel, and got back to Holland in\r\nthe end of May, 1698. He took with him three captains of men-of-war,\r\nfive-and-twenty captains of merchant ships, forty lieutenants, thirty\r\npilots, thirty surgeons, two hundred and fifty gunners, and upwards of\r\nthree hundred artificers. This colony of ingenious men in the several\r\narts and professions sailed from Holland to Archangel on board the _Royal\r\nTransport_; and were sent thence to the different places where their\r\nservice was necessary. Those whom he engaged at Amsterdam took the route\r\nof Narva, at that time subject to Sweden.\r\n\r\nWhile the czar was thus transporting the arts and manufactures from\r\nEngland and Holland to his own dominions, the officers whom he had sent\r\nto Rome and Italy succeeded so far as also to engage some artists in\r\nhis service. General Sheremetrev, who was at the head of his embassy to\r\nItaly, made the tour of Rome, Naples, Venice, and Malta; while the czar\r\nproceeded to Vienna with the other ambassadors. All he had to do now\r\nwas to observe the military discipline of the Germans, after seeing the\r\nEnglish fleet and the dockyards in Holland. But it was not the desire of\r\nimprovement alone that induced him to make this tour to Vienna, he had\r\nlikewise a political view; for the emperor of Germany was the natural\r\nally of the Russians against the Turks. Peter had a private audience of\r\nLeopold, and the two monarchs stood the whole time of the interview, to\r\navoid the trouble of ceremony.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: EXECUTION OF THE STRELITZ BY COMMAND OF PETER THE GREAT\r\n\r\n(Painted for THE HISTORIANS’ HISTORY OF THE WORLD by Thure de Thulstrup)]\r\n\r\nDuring his stay at Vienna, there happened nothing remarkable, except\r\nthe celebration of the ancient feast of “landlord and landlady,” which\r\nLeopold thought proper to revive upon the czar’s account, after it\r\nhad been disused during his whole reign. The manner of making this\r\nentertainment, to which the Germans gave the name of _Wirthschaft_, was\r\nas follows: The emperor was landlord, and the empress landlady; the\r\nking of the Romans, the archdukes, and the archduchesses were generally\r\ntheir assistants; they entertained people of all nations, dressed after\r\nthe most ancient fashion of their respective countries. Those who were\r\ninvited as guests drew lots for tickets; on each of which was written the\r\nname of the nation, and the character to be represented. One had a ticket\r\nfor a Chinese mandarin, another for a Tatar mirza, another for a Persian\r\nsatrap, or a Roman senator; a princess might happen to be allotted the\r\npart of a gardener’s wife, or a milkwoman; and a prince might act the\r\npeasant or soldier. They had dances suited to these different characters;\r\nand the landlord and landlady with their family waited at table. On\r\nthis occasion Peter assumed the habit of a Friesland boor, and in this\r\ncharacter was addressed by everybody, at the same time that they talked\r\nto him of the great czar of Muscovy. “These indeed are trifles,” says\r\nVoltaire, from whom the account is taken, “but whatever revives the\r\nmemory of ancient customs is, in some measure, worthy of being recorded.”\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE INSURRECTION OF THE STRELITZ\r\n\r\nPeter was preparing to continue his journey from Vienna to Venice and\r\nRome when he was recalled to his own dominions by news of a general\r\ninsurrection of the strelitz, who had quitted their posts on the\r\nfrontiers, and marched on Moscow. Peter immediately left Vienna in\r\nsecret, passed through Poland, where he had an interview with King\r\nAugustus, and arrived at Moscow in September, 1698, before anyone there\r\nknew of his having left Germany.[e]\r\n\r\nWhen Peter I arrived from Vienna he found that his generals and the douma\r\nhad acted with too great leniency. He cherished an old grudge against\r\nthe strelitz; they had formed the army of Sophia which had been arrayed\r\nagainst that of the czar, and in his mind was still alive the memory\r\nof the invasion of the Kremlin, the murder of his maternal relatives,\r\nthe terrors undergone by his mother in Troitsa, the plots that had\r\nwell-nigh prevented his departure for the west, and the check placed by\r\nthe mutineers on the plans he had matured for the good of his country\r\nduring his journey through Europe. He resolved to seize the opportunity\r\nthus placed in his hands to crush all his enemies at one blow, and to\r\ninaugurate in old Russia a reign of terror that should recall the days of\r\nIvan IV. The particular point of attack had been his taste for foreign\r\nfashions, for shaven chins, and abbreviated garments. These therefore\r\nshould be the rallying-sign of the Russia of the future. Long beards had\r\nbeen the standard of revolt; long beards must fall. He ordered all the\r\ngentlemen of his realm to shave, and even performed that office with his\r\nown hand for some of the highest nobles of his court. On the same day the\r\nRed Square was covered with gibbets. The patriarch Adrian tried in vain\r\nto divert the anger of the czar. “My duty is to protect the people and to\r\npunish rebels,” was the only answer he received.\r\n\r\nOn the 10th of October a first consignment of two hundred prisoners\r\narrived in the Red Square, followed by their wives and children, who\r\nran behind the carts chanting funeral dirges. The czar ordered several\r\nofficers to assist the headsman in his work. Johann Korb, an Austrian who\r\nwas an eye-witness of the scene, relates that the heads of “five rebels\r\nwere struck off by the noblest hand in Russia.” Seven more days were\r\ndevoted to the executions, and in all about a thousand victims perished.\r\nMany were previously broken on the wheel or given up to other frightful\r\ntortures. The czar forbade the removal of any of the bodies, and for five\r\nmonths Moscow was given the spectacle of corpses hanging from the turrets\r\nof the Kremlin, or exposed in the public squares. Two of Sophia’s female\r\nconfidantes were buried alive, and Sophia herself and the repudiated\r\nczarina, Eudoxia Lapukhin, noted for her attachment to old customs,\r\nwere confined in monasteries. After the revolt of the inhabitants of\r\nAstrakhan, who murdered their voyevod (1705), the militia was abolished\r\nand the way was clear for the establishment of a new army.[g]\r\n\r\n\r\nWAR WITH SWEDEN\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [1699 A.D.]]\r\n\r\nThe external relations as well as the domestic circumstances of the\r\nempire were at this juncture peculiarly favourable to the czar’s grand\r\ndesign of opening a communication with the Baltic. He had just concluded\r\na treaty of peace for thirty years with the Turks, and he found himself\r\nat the head of a numerous army, a portion, at least, of which was well\r\ndisciplined, and eager for employment. The death of General Lefort, in\r\n1699, at the early age of forty-six, slightly retarded the progress of\r\nhis movements; but in the following year he prepared to avail himself of\r\nevents that called other powers into action and afforded him a feasible\r\nexcuse for taking the field.\r\n\r\nCharles XII, then only eighteen years of age, had recently succeeded\r\nto the throne of Sweden. The occasion seemed to yield an auspicious\r\nopportunity to Poland and Denmark for the recovery of certain provinces\r\nthat in the course of former wars had either been wrested from them\r\nby Sweden, or ceded by capitulation. Augustus, the elector of Saxony,\r\ncalled by choice to the throne of Poland, was the first to assert this\r\ndoctrine of restitution, in which he was quickly followed by the Danish\r\nking. Livonia and Esthonia had been ceded by Poland to Charles XI, and\r\nthe provinces of Holstein and Schleswig had been conquered from Denmark\r\nin the same reign, and annexed to the Swedish territories. The object\r\nof the allies was to recover those places. Sweden, thus assailed in two\r\nquarters, presented an apparently easy victory to the czar, whose purpose\r\nit was to possess himself of Ingria and Karelia, that lay between him and\r\nthe sea. A confederacy was, therefore, entered into by the three powers\r\nfor the specific view of recovering by war those provinces that had\r\npreviously been lost by war. But Peter miscalculated his means. The arms\r\nof Sweden were crowned with triumphs, and her soldiery were experienced\r\nin the field. The Russian troops, on the contrary, were for the greater\r\npart but raw recruits, and, except against the Turks and Tatars, had as\r\nyet but little practice in military operations. The genius of Peter alone\r\ncould have vanquished the difficulties of so unequal a contest.\r\n\r\nThe preparations that were thus in course of organisation awakened the\r\nenergies of Charles. Without waiting for the signal of attack from\r\nthe enemy, he sent a force of eight thousand men into Pomerania, and,\r\nembarking with a fleet of forty sail, he suddenly appeared before\r\nCopenhagen, compelled the king of Denmark within six weeks to sign a\r\npeace by which the possession of Holstein was confirmed to the reigning\r\nduke, and a full indemnity obtained for all the expenses of the war. He\r\nhad no sooner overthrown the designs of the Danish monarch than he turned\r\nhis arms against Poland. Augustus had laid siege to Riga, the capital of\r\nLivonia; but that city was defended with such obstinacy by Count Dalberg\r\nthat the Polish general was glad to abandon the enterprise, upon the\r\nshallow pretext that he wished to spare the Dutch merchandise which was\r\nat that time stored in the port. Thus the confederation was dissolved,\r\nand the struggle was left single-handed between the Russians and the\r\nSwedes.\r\n\r\nPeter, undismayed by the reverses of his allies, poured into Ingria\r\nan army of sixty thousand men. Of these troops there were but twelve\r\nthousand disciplined soldiers; the remainder consisted of serfs and fresh\r\nlevies, gathered from all quarters, rudely clad, armed only with clubs\r\nand pikes, and unacquainted with the use of firearms. The Swedish army,\r\non the other hand, was only eight thousand strong; but it was composed\r\nof experienced battalions, flushed by recent successes, and commanded\r\nby able generals. The advanced guards of the Russians were dispersed on\r\ntheir progress, in some skirmishes with the Swedes; but the main body\r\npenetrated to the interior, and intrenched itself before the walls of\r\nNarva, a fortified place on the banks of the Narova, a river that flowed\r\nfrom Lake Peipus into the Baltic Sea. For two months they lay before the\r\ntown, when Peter, finding it necessary to hasten the movements of some\r\nregiments that were on their march from Novgorod, as well as to confer\r\nwith the king of Poland in consequence of his abandonment of the siege\r\nof Riga, left the camp, delegating the command to the duke of Croy, a\r\nFlemish officer, and prince Dolgoruki, the commissary-general.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [1701 A.D.]]\r\n\r\nHis absence was fatal to this undertaking. Charles, during a violent\r\nsnow-storm, that blew directly in the face of the Russians, attacked\r\nthe enemy in their intrenchments. The besiegers were filled with\r\nconsternation. The duke of Croy issued orders which the prince Dolgoruki\r\nrefused to execute, and the utmost confusion prevailed amongst the\r\ntroops. The Russian officers rose against the Germans and massacred the\r\nduke’s secretary, Colonel Lyons, and several others. The presence of\r\nthe sovereign was necessary to restore confidence and order, and, in\r\nthe absence of a controlling mind the soldiers, flying from their posts\r\nand impeding each other in their attempts to escape, were slaughtered\r\nin detail by the Swedes. In this exigency, the duke of Croy, as much\r\nalarmed by the temper of the Russians as by the superiority of the enemy,\r\ntogether with almost all the German officers in the service, surrendered\r\nto the victorious Charles, who, affecting to despise his antagonist,\r\ncontented himself with retaining a few general officers and some of the\r\nSaxon auxiliaries, as prisoners to grace his ovation at Stockholm, and\r\nsuffered the vanquished troops to return home. Thus failed the first\r\ndescent upon Ingria, which cost Russia, even on the statement of the\r\nczar himself, between five thousand and six thousand men. The loss of\r\nthe Swedes is estimated by Peter at three thousand, but Voltaire reduces\r\nthe number to twelve hundred, which, considering the relative positions\r\nof both armies, and the disadvantages of other kinds under which the\r\nRussians were placed, is more likely to be accurate.\r\n\r\nThis unpropitious event did not discourage Peter. “The Swedes,” he\r\nobserved, “will have the advantage of us for some time, but they will\r\nteach us, at last, how to beat them.” If Charles, however, had followed\r\nup his success, and pushed his fortunes into the heart of Russia\r\nimmediately after this victory, he might have decided the fate of the\r\nempire at the gates of Moscow. But, elated with his triumphs in Denmark,\r\nand tempted by the weakness of the Poles, he embraced the more facile\r\nand dazzling project of concentrating his whole power against Augustus,\r\ndeclaring that he would never withdraw his army from Poland until he had\r\ndeprived the elector of his throne. The opportunity he thus afforded\r\nPeter of recruiting his shattered forces, and organising fresh means of\r\naggression, was the most remarkable mistake in the whole career of that\r\nvain but heroic monarch.\r\n\r\n\r\nRALLYING FROM DEFEAT\r\n\r\nWhile Charles was engaged in Poland, Peter gained time for the\r\naccomplishment of those measures which his situation suggested.\r\nDespatching a body of troops to protect the frontiers at Pskov, he\r\nrepaired in person to Moscow, and occupied himself throughout the ensuing\r\nwinter in raising and training six regiments of infantry, consisting of\r\n1000 men each, and several regiments of dragoons. Having lost 145 pieces\r\nof cannon in the affair at Narva he ordered a certain proportion of the\r\nbells of the convents and churches to be cast into field pieces; and\r\nwas prepared in the spring of the year 1701 to resume hostilities with\r\nincreased strength, and an artillery of 100 pieces of cannon, 142 field\r\npieces, 12 mortars, and 13 howitzers.\r\n\r\nNor did he confine his attention to the improvement of the army.\r\nConscious of the importance of diffusing employment amongst his subjects,\r\nand increasing their domestic prosperity, he introduced into the\r\ncountry flocks of sheep from Saxony, and shepherds to attend to them,\r\nfor the sake of the wool; established hospitals, and linen and paper\r\nmanufactories; encouraged the art of printing; and invited from distant\r\nplaces a variety of artisans to impart to the lower classes a knowledge\r\nof useful crafts. These proceedings were treated with levity and contempt\r\nby Charles, who appears all throughout to have despised the Russians,\r\nand who, engrossed by his campaign in Courland and Lithuania, intended\r\nto turn back to Moscow at his leisure, after he should have dethroned\r\nAugustus, and ravaged the domains of Saxony.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately the divisions that prevailed in the councils of Poland\r\nassisted to carry these projects rapidly into effect. Peter was anxious\r\nto enter into a new alliance with Augustus, but, in an interview he held\r\nwith that prince at Birzen, he discovered the weakness of his position\r\nand the hopelessness of expecting any effectual succour at his hands.\r\nThe Polish diet, equally jealous of the interference of the Saxon and\r\nRussian soldiery in their affairs, and afraid to incur the hostility of\r\nCharles, refused to sanction a league that threatened to involve them in\r\nserious difficulties. Hence, Augustus, left to his own resources, was\r\neasily deprived of a throne which he seemed to hold against the consent\r\nof the people, while Peter was forced to conduct the war alone. His\r\nmeasures were consequently taken with promptitude and decision. His army\r\nwas no sooner prepared for action than he re-entered Ingria, animating\r\nthe troops by his presence at the several points to which he directed\r\ntheir movements. In some accidental skirmishes with small bodies of the\r\nSwedes, he reaped a series of minor successes, that inspired the soldiers\r\nwith confidence and improved their skill for the more important scenes\r\nthat were to follow. Constantly in motion between Pskov, Moscow, and\r\nArchangel, at which last place he built a fortress called the New Dvina,\r\nhe diffused a spirit of enthusiasm amongst the soldiers, who were now\r\nbecoming inured to action.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [1702 A.D.]]\r\n\r\nAn open battle at last took place in the neighbourhood of Dorpat, on the\r\nborders of Livonia, when General Sheremetrev fell in with the main body\r\nof the enemy on the 1st of January, 1702, and, after a severe conflict\r\nof four hours, compelled them to abandon their artillery and fly in\r\ndisorder. On this occasion, the Swedes are said to have lost three\r\nthousand men, while there were but one thousand killed on the opposite\r\nside. General Sheremetrev was immediately created a field-marshal, and\r\npublic thanks were offered up for the victory.\r\n\r\nFollowing up this signal triumph, the czar equipped one fleet upon Lake\r\nPeipus to protect the territory of Novgorod, and manned another upon Lake\r\nLadoga, to resist the Swedes in case they should attempt a landing. Thus\r\nguarded at the vulnerable points, he was enabled to prosecute his plans\r\nin the interior with greater certainty and effect.\r\n\r\nMarshal Sheremetrev in the meantime marched upon Marienburg, a town on\r\nthe confines of Livonia and Ingria, achieving on his progress another\r\ntriumph over the enemy near the village of Humolova. The garrison at\r\nMarienburg, afraid to risk the consequences of a siege, capitulated\r\nat once, on condition that the inhabitants should be permitted a free\r\npassage, which was agreed to; but an intemperate officer having set fire\r\nto the powder magazine, to prevent the negotiation from being effected,\r\nby which a number of soldiers on both sides were killed, the Russians\r\nfell upon the inhabitants and destroyed the town.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ANTECEDENTS OF AN EMPRESS\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CATHERINE I\r\n\r\n(1679-1727)]\r\n\r\nAmongst the prisoners of war was a young Livonian girl, called Martha,\r\nan orphan who resided in the household of the Lutheran minister of\r\nMarienburg. She had been married the day before to a sergeant in the\r\nSwedish army; and when she appeared in the presence of the Russian\r\ngeneral Bauer, she was bathed in tears, in consequence of the death of\r\nher husband, who was supposed to have perished in the melée. Struck\r\nwith her appearance, and curious to learn the history of so interesting\r\na person, the general took her to his house, and appointed her to the\r\nsuperintendence of his household affairs. Bauer was an unmarried man,\r\nand it was not surprising that his intercourse with Martha should have\r\nexposed her to the imputation of having become his mistress; nor, indeed,\r\nis there any reason, judging by the immediate circumstances as well as\r\nthe subsequent life of that celebrated woman, to doubt the truth of the\r\ncharge. Bauer is said to have denied the fact, which is sufficiently\r\nprobable, as it was evidently to his interest to acquit the lady of\r\nsuch an accusation; but, however that may be, it is certain that Prince\r\nMenshikov, seeing her at the general’s house, and fascinated by her\r\nmanners, solicited the general to transfer her services to his domestic\r\nestablishment; which was at once acceded to by the general, who was under\r\ntoo many obligations to the prince to leave him the option of a refusal.\r\n\r\nMartha now became the avowed mistress of the libertine Menshikov, in\r\nwhich capacity she lived with him until the year 1704, when, at the\r\nearly age of seventeen, she enslaved the czar as much by her talents as\r\nby her beauty, and exchanged the house of the prince for the palace of\r\nthe sovereign. The extraordinary influence she subsequently exercised\r\nwhen, from having been the mistress she became the wife of the czar, and\r\nultimately the empress Catherine, developing, throughout the various\r\nturns of her fortune, a genius worthy of consort with that of Peter\r\nhimself, opens a page in history not less wonderful than instructive.\r\nThe marriage of the sovereign with a subject was common in Russia; but,\r\nas Voltaire remarks, the union of royalty with a poor stranger, captured\r\namidst the ruins of a pillaged town, is an incident which the most\r\nmarvellous combinations of fortune and merit never produced before or\r\nsince in the annals of the world.\r\n\r\n\r\nMILITARY SUCCESS: FOUNDATION OF ST. PETERSBURG\r\n\r\nThe most important operations of the campaign in the year 1702 were\r\nnow directed to the river Neva, the branches of which issue from the\r\nextremity of Lake Ladoga, and, subsequently reuniting, are discharged\r\ninto the Baltic. Close to the point where the river flowed from the lake\r\nwas an island, on which stood the strongly fortified town of Rottenburg.\r\nThis place, maintaining a position that was of the utmost consequence\r\nto his future views, Peter resolved to reduce in the first instance;\r\nand, after laying siege to it for nearly a month, succeeded in carrying\r\nit by assault. A profusion of rewards and honours were on this occasion\r\ndistributed amongst the army, and a triumphal procession was made to\r\nMoscow, in which the prisoners of war followed in the train of the\r\nconqueror. The name of Rottenburg was changed to that of Schlüsselburg,\r\nor city of the key, because that place was the key to Ingria and Finland.\r\nThe solemnities and pomp by which these triumphs were celebrated were\r\nstill treated with contempt by Charles, who, believing that he could at\r\nany moment reduce the Russians, continued to pursue his victories over\r\nAugustus. But Peter was rapidly acquiring power in the very direction\r\nwhich was most fatal to his opponent, and which was directly calculated\r\nto lead to the speedy accomplishment of his final purpose.\r\n\r\nThe complete occupation of the shores of the Neva was the first object\r\nto be achieved. The expulsion of the enemy from all the places lying\r\nimmediately on its borders and the possession or destruction of all the\r\nposts which the Swedes held in Ingria and Karelia were essential to the\r\nplans of the czar. Already an important fortress lying close to the river\r\nwas besieged and reduced, and two Swedish vessels were captured on the\r\nlake by the czar in person. Further successes over the Swedish gunboats,\r\nthat hovered near the mouth of the river, hastened his victorious\r\nprogress; and when he had made himself master of the fortress of Kantzi,\r\non the Karelian side, he paused to consider whether it would be advisable\r\nto strengthen that place, and make it the centre of future operations, or\r\npush onwards to some position nearer to the sea. The latter proposal was\r\ndecided upon; and a marshy island, covered with brushwood, inhabited by\r\na few fishermen, and not very distant from the embouchure of the Neva,\r\nwas chosen as the most favourable site for a new fortress. The place was,\r\nby a singular anomaly, called Lust Eland, or Pleasure Island, and was\r\napparently ill adapted for the destinies that in after-times surrounded\r\nit with glory and splendour. On this pestilential spot, Peter laid the\r\nfoundations of the fortress of St. Petersburg, which gradually expanded\r\ninto a city and ultimately became the capital of the empire.\r\n\r\nThe country in the neighbourhood of this desolate island, or cluster\r\nof swamps, was one vast morass. It did not yield a particle of stone,\r\nand the materials with which the citadel was built were derived\r\nfrom the ruins of the works at Nianshantz. Nor were these the only\r\ndifficulties against which Peter had to contend in the construction of\r\nthe fortifications. The labourers were not furnished with the necessary\r\ntools, and were obliged to toil by such expedients as their own invention\r\ncould devise. So poorly were they appointed for a work of such magnitude\r\nthat they were obliged to carry the earth, which was very scarce, from a\r\nconsiderable distance in the skirts of their coats, or in bags made of\r\nshreds and matting. Yet the fortress was completed within five months,\r\nand before the expiration of a year St. Petersburg contained thirty\r\nthousand houses and huts of different descriptions.\r\n\r\nSo gigantic an undertaking was not accomplished without danger, as well\r\nas extreme labour. Peter, who could not be turned aside from his purposes\r\nby ordinary obstacles, collected a vast concourse of people from a\r\nvariety of countries, including Russians, Tatars, Kalmucks, Cossacks,\r\nIngrians, and Finlanders; and employed them, without intermission, and\r\nwithout shelter from an inclement climate of sixty degrees of latitude,\r\nin deepening the channels of the rivers and raising the general level of\r\nthe islands which were in the winter seasons usually sunk in the floods.\r\nThe severity of the labour, and the insufficiency of provisions, caused\r\na great mortality amongst the workmen. A hundred thousand men are said\r\nto have perished in the first year. While this fort was in progress of\r\nerection, Peter despatched Menzikov to a little island lying nearer to\r\nthe mouth of the river, to build another fortress for the protection\r\nof the entrance. The model of the fortress was made by himself in\r\nwood. He gave it the name of Kronstadt, which, with the adjacent town\r\nand buildings, it still retains. Under the cannon of this impregnable\r\nfortress the largest fleet might float in shelter.\r\n\r\nThe establishment of a new city on so unfavorable a site, and the\r\ncontemplated removal of the seat of government, received considerable\r\nopposition from the boyars and upper classes, as well as from the\r\ninferior grades, who regarded the place with terror, in consequence\r\nof the mortality it had already produced. The discontent of the lower\r\norders broke out in loud complaints during Peter’s temporary absence. No\r\nmeasures short of the most despotic could have compelled the inhabitants\r\nof Moscow to migrate to the bleak and dismal islands of the Neva, and\r\nPeter was not slow to carry such measures into effect.\r\n\r\nIf the people could have looked beyond the convenience of the moment into\r\nthe future prospects of the empire, they must at once have perceived\r\nthe wisdom of the change. The paramount object of Peter’s policy was\r\nthe internal improvement of Russia. The withdrawal of the nobility, the\r\nmerchants, and the artisans from their rude capital in the interior, to\r\nan imperial seat on the gulf of Finland, by which they would be brought\r\ninto closer intercourse with civilised Europe, and acquire increased\r\nfacilities for commercial enterprise, was evidently calculated to promote\r\nthat object, which was distinctly kept in view in the place upon which\r\nthe city was built. Peter had not forgotten the practical lessons he had\r\nlearned during his residence in Holland. That country, the inhabitants\r\nof which in Pliny’s time were described to be amphibious, as if it were\r\ndoubtful to which element, the land or the sea, they really belonged, had\r\nbeen redeemed from the ocean by the activity and skill of the people;\r\nand Peter, profiting by their experience, adopted Amsterdam as his model\r\nin securing the foundations of St. Petersburg. He employed several Dutch\r\narchitects and masons; and the wharfs, canals, bridges, and rectilineal\r\nstreets, planted with rows of trees, attest the accuracy with which the\r\ndesign was accomplished. To a neighbouring island, which he made a depot\r\nfor timber, he gave the name of New Holland, as if he meant to leave to\r\nposterity an acknowledgement of the obligations he owed to that country.\r\n\r\nThe speculations of the czar were rapidly fulfilled in the commercial\r\nrelations invited by the establishment of St. Petersburg. Five months\r\nhad scarcely elapsed from the day of its foundation when a Dutch ship,\r\nfreighted with merchandise, stood into the river. Before the expiration\r\nof a year, another vessel from Holland arrived; and the third vessel,\r\nwithin the year, that entered the new port was from England. These\r\ngratifying facts inspired confidence amongst those who had been disposed\r\nto look upon the project with such hasty distrust; and Peter, whose\r\npower was now rapidly growing up on all sides, was enabled to extend his\r\noperations in every direction over Ingria. The variety of affairs which,\r\nat this juncture, occupied his attention sufficiently proves the grasp\r\nof his capacity and the extraordinary energy of his mind. At nearly the\r\nsame time that he founded a new capital he was employed in fortifying\r\nPskov, Novgorod, Kiev, Smolensk, Azov, and Archangel; and in assisting\r\nthe unfortunate Augustus with men and money. Cornelius van Bruyer, a\r\nDutchman, who at that period was travelling in Holland, states that Peter\r\ninformed him that, notwithstanding all these undertakings, he had 300,000\r\nroubles remaining in his coffers, after providing for all the charges of\r\nthe war.\r\n\r\nThe advances that the czar was thus making in strengthening and\r\ncivilising the empire were regarded with such contempt by Charles that he\r\nis reported to have said that Peter might amuse himself as he thought\r\nfit in building a city, as he should soon find him to take it from him\r\nand set fire to his wooden houses. The Porte, however, did not look\r\nwith indifference upon his movements, and sent an ambassador to him to\r\ncomplain of his preparations; but Peter replied that he was master of his\r\nown dominions, as the Porte was of his, and that his object was not to\r\ninfringe the peace, but to render Russia “respectable” upon the Euxine.\r\n\r\n\r\nRENEWED HOSTILITIES\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [1704 A.D.]]\r\n\r\nThe time was now approaching when the decision of the disputes in Poland\r\nenabled Charles to turn back upon Ingria, where Peter was making so\r\nsuccessful a stand. On the 14th of February, 1704, the primate of Warsaw\r\nthrew off his allegiance to Augustus, who was in due form deposed by the\r\ndiet. The nomination of the new king was placed in the hands of Charles,\r\nwho proposed Stanislaus Leszczynski, a young nobleman distinguished\r\nfor his accomplishments, who was accordingly declared king of Poland\r\nand grand duke of Lithuania. But Lithuania had not as yet sent in her\r\nadherence to either side; and Peter, still taking a deep interest in the\r\nfortunes of Augustus, whose Saxon troops were every day suffering fresh\r\ndiscomfitures from the Swedish army, sent that monarch a reinforcement\r\nof twelve thousand men to support his claims in the undecided province.\r\nThe military force of Russia had now become a formidable body, highly\r\ndisciplined, and fully equipped; and Peter, without loss of time, in the\r\nspring of 1704, disposed the remainder of his army into two divisions,\r\none of which he sent under the command of Field-Marshal Sheremetrev, to\r\nbesiege Dorpat, while he took in person the conduct of the other against\r\nNarva, where he had formerly endured a signal defeat.\r\n\r\nDorpat, which is better known by this siege than by the university\r\nwhich Gustavus Adolphus had previously established there, was forced to\r\ncapitulate by a _ruse de guerre_. It was necessary in the first instance\r\nto become master of Lake Peipus, for which purpose a Russian flotilla\r\nwas placed at the entrance of the Embach. Upon the advance of a Swedish\r\nsquadron a naval battle ensued, which ended in the capture or destruction\r\nof the whole of the enemy’s fleet. Peter now sat down before Dorpat,\r\nbut, finding that the commandant held out for six weeks, he adopted an\r\ningenious device to procure entrance into the town. He disguised two\r\nregiments of infantry and one of cavalry in the uniforms of Swedish\r\nsoldiers, giving them Swedish standards and flags. These pretended Swedes\r\nattacked the trenches, and the Russians feigned a fight. The garrison\r\nof the town, deceived by appearances, made a sortie, when the false\r\nattackers and the attacked reunited, fell upon the troops, and entered\r\nthe town. A great slaughter ensued, and, to save the remainder of the\r\ngarrison, the commandant surrendered.\r\n\r\nAt Narva Peter was equally successful. The siege was conducted under his\r\nown personal command. Sword in hand, he attacked three bastions that\r\noffered the strongest points of defence, carried them all, and burst into\r\nthe town. The barbarities that ensued were of a nature to revolt even the\r\nczar himself. Pillage, slaughter, and lustful excesses were committed by\r\nthe infuriated men; and Peter, shocked at the cruelties he witnessed,\r\nthrew himself amongst the barbarians who refused to obey his orders and\r\nslew several of them in the public streets. A number of the unfortunate\r\ncitizens had taken refuge in the hôtel de ville; and the czar, appearing\r\nin the midst of them, cast his bloody sword on the table, declaring\r\nthat it was stained not with the blood of the citizens but of his own\r\nsoldiers, which he had shed to save their lives.\r\n\r\nThese victories were decisive of the position of Peter. He was now master\r\nof all Ingria, the government of which he conferred upon Menzikov, whom\r\nhe created a prince of the empire and major-general in the army. The\r\nelevation of Menzikov, through the various grades of the service, from\r\nhis humble situation as a pastrycook’s boy to the highest dignities in\r\nthe state, was a practical reproof to the indolent and ignorant nobility,\r\nwho were now taught to feel that merit was the only recommendation to\r\nthe favour of the czar. The old system of promotion was closed. The\r\nclaims of birth and the pride of station ceased to possess any influence\r\nat court. The great body of the people, impressed with the justice that\r\ndictated this important change in the dispensation of honour and rewards,\r\nbegan for the first time to be inspired with a spirit of emulation and\r\nactivity; and exactly in proportion as Peter forfeited the attachment\r\nof the few, whose power was daily on the decline, he drew around him\r\nthe mixed wonder and allegiance of the many, whose power he was daily\r\nenlarging. Thus were laid the foundations of a mighty empire in the\r\nhearts of a scattered population, as various in habits and in language as\r\nit had always been discordant in interests and disunited in action.\r\n\r\nHaving acquired this valuable possession, and secured himself in St.\r\nPetersburg against the Swedes, it was the profound policy of Peter to\r\nkeep up the war between Charles and Augustus, with a view to weaken\r\nby diversion the strength of the former. He accordingly made a great\r\noffer of assistance to the dethroned king, and despatched General\r\nRepuin with six thousand horse and six thousand foot to the borders of\r\nLithuania; while he advanced in person into Courland at the head of a\r\nstrong force. Here he received a severe check, having fallen in with\r\nthe Swedish general Lewenhauft, who defeated the Russians after an\r\nobstinate battle, in which the czar’s troops lost between five thousand\r\nand six thousand men, and the Swedes no more than two thousand. Peter,\r\nnotwithstanding, penetrated into Courland, and laid siege to the capital,\r\nwhich surrendered by capitulation. On this occasion the Swedes degraded\r\nthemselves by committing an extensive pillage in the palace and archives\r\nof the dukes of Courland, descending even into the mausoleums to rob\r\nthe dead of their jewels. The Russians, however, before they would take\r\ncharge of the vaults, made a Swedish colonel sign a certificate that\r\ntheir sacrilegious depredations were the acts of his own countrymen.\r\n\r\n\r\nPOLISH AFFAIRS\r\n\r\nThe greatest part of Courland, as well as the whole of Ingria, had now\r\nbeen conquered in detail by Peter, and, as Charles was still engrossed\r\nby his operations in Poland and Saxony, he returned to Moscow to pass\r\nthe winter; but intelligence of the approach of the Swedish king at the\r\nhead of a powerful force towards Grodno, where the combined armies of\r\nRussia and Saxony were encamped, recalled him from his repose. Peter\r\nimmediately hastened to the field, and found all the avenues occupied by\r\nSwedish troops. A battle ensued near Frauenstadt, in which the flower of\r\nthe confederated battalions, under the command of General Schullemberg,\r\nto the number of eighteen thousand men, six thousand of whom were\r\nRussians, suffered a complete defeat. With an insignificant exception,\r\nthey were nearly all slain. Some authorities attribute this disaster\r\nto the treachery of a French regiment, which had the care of the Saxon\r\nartillery; but it is certain that the most sanguinary atrocities were\r\ncommitted on both sides, in a contest upon the issues of which two crowns\r\nappeared to be dependent.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WIFE OF A MERCHANT OF KALONGA]\r\n\r\nThe consequences of this overthrow would have been immediately fatal\r\nto Augustus, but for the energy of the czar, who, rapidly organising\r\nan army of twenty thousand men, urged that wavering prince to take\r\nadvantage of the absence of Charles in Saxony, and throw himself once\r\nmore into Poland. A revolt in Astrakhan called Peter into that part of\r\nhis territories; but he deputed General Patkul, a brave Livonian, who had\r\nformerly made his escape from the hands of Charles, and had passed from\r\nthe service of Augustus into that of the czar, to explain the necessity\r\nof the measure. Augustus yielded to the advice of his ally, and marched\r\ninto Poland; but he had no sooner made good his progress than, suddenly\r\npanic-struck by the increasing successes of Charles, he resolved to sue\r\nfor peace upon any terms at which it could be procured. He accordingly\r\ninvested two ambassadors with full powers to treat confidentially with\r\nCharles, and had the temerity to cast Patkul into prison. While the\r\nplenipotentiaries were negotiating this shameful treaty at the camp of\r\nCharles XII, Menshikov joined the forces of Augustus at Kalish with\r\nthirty thousand men. The consternation of Augustus at this unexpected\r\nreinforcement was indescribable; and his confusion amounted almost to\r\ndespair upon the receipt of intelligence that ten thousand Swedes, under\r\nthe command of General Meierfeldt, were on their march to give him battle.\r\n\r\nIn this dilemma he transmitted a private message to General Meierfeldt\r\nto inform him of the negotiation he had opened with his master; but\r\nthat general, naturally treating the whole affair as a mere pretext to\r\ngain time, made preparations for hostilities. The superior force of\r\nthe Russians decided the fate of the day, and, after having defeated\r\nthe Swedes with great slaughter, they entered Warsaw in triumph. Had\r\nAugustus relied upon the energy and friendship of his ally, he would now\r\nhave been replaced upon his throne; but the timidity that tempted him\r\nto cast himself upon the mercy of Charles was prolific of misfortunes.\r\nHe had scarcely entered Warsaw as a victor when he was met by his own\r\nplenipotentiaries, who placed before him the treaty they had just\r\nconcluded, by which he had forfeited the crown of Poland forever. His\r\nhumiliation was complete. Thus the weak and vacillating Augustus, fresh\r\nfrom a triumph that ought to have placed him upon the throne of Poland,\r\nwas a vassal in its capital, while Charles was giving the law in Leipsic\r\nand reigning in his lost electorate.\r\n\r\nHis struggles to escape from the disgrace into which his folly and his\r\nfears had plunged him only drew down fresh contempt upon his head. He\r\nwrote to Charles a letter of explanation and apology, in which he begged\r\npardon for having obtained a victory against his will, protesting that it\r\nwas entirely the act of the Russians, whom it was his full intention to\r\nhave abandoned, in conformity with the wishes of Charles; and assuring\r\nthat monarch that he would do anything in his power to render him\r\nsatisfaction for the great wrong he had committed in daring to beat his\r\ntroops. Not content with this piece of humility, and fearing to remain at\r\nWarsaw, he proceeded to Saxony, and, in the heart of his own dominions,\r\nwhere the members of his family were fugitives, he surrendered in person\r\nto the victorious Swede. Charles was too conscious of his advantages\r\nnot to avail himself of them to the full, and not only made the timid\r\nAugustus fulfil all the stipulations of the treaty, by which he renounced\r\nthe crown of Poland, abandoned his alliance with the czar, surrendered\r\nthe Swedish prisoners, and gave up all the deserters, including General\r\nPatkul, whom Augustus had arrested by a violation of good faith, but he\r\nforced him to write a letter to Stanislaus, congratulating him on his\r\naccession to the throne. The unfortunate Patkul was no sooner delivered\r\ninto the hands of Charles than he condemned him to be broken on the wheel\r\nand quartered.\r\n\r\nThe timid and treacherous conduct of Augustus and the deliberate cruelty\r\nof Charles drew from Peter expressions of unbounded indignation. He laid\r\na statement of the whole circumstances before the principal potentates\r\nof Europe, and declared his determination to use all the means in his\r\npower to drive Stanislaus from the throne of Poland. The first measure\r\nhe adopted was the holding of a conference with several of the Polish\r\ngrandees, whom he completely gained over to his side by the suavity of\r\nhis manners. At a subsequent meeting it was agreed that the throne of\r\nPoland was in fact vacant, and that a diet should be summoned for the\r\npurpose of electing a king. When the diet assembled, Peter urged upon\r\ntheir attention the peculiar circumstances in which the country was\r\nplaced, and the impossibility of effecting any substantial resistance\r\nagainst the ambitious intrigues of Charles, unless a new king were placed\r\nupon the throne. His views were confirmed by the voice of the assembly,\r\nwho agreed to the public declaration of an interregnum, and to the\r\ninvestiture of the primate in the office of regent until the election\r\nshould have taken place.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES XII INVADES RUSSIA (1707 A.D.)\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [1707 A.D.]]\r\n\r\nBut while these proceedings were going forward at Lublin, King\r\nStanislaus, who had been previously acknowledged by most of the\r\nsovereigns of Europe, was advancing into Poland at the head of sixteen\r\nSwedish regiments, and was received with regal honours in all the places\r\nthrough which he passed. Nor was this the only danger that threatened\r\nto arrest the course of the proposed arrangements for the settlement\r\nof the troubles of Poland. Charles, whose campaign in Saxony had\r\nconsiderably enriched his treasury, was now prepared to take the field\r\nwith a well-disciplined army of forty-five thousand men, besides the\r\nforce commanded by General Lewenhaupt; and he did not affect to conceal\r\nhis intention to make Russia the theatre of war, in which purpose he\r\nwas strengthened by an offer on the part of the Porte to enter into an\r\noffensive alliance with him against Peter, whose interference in the\r\naffairs of Poland excited great jealousy and alarm in Turkey. Charles\r\ncalculated in some degree upon the support he might receive from the\r\nRussians themselves, who, he believed, would be easily induced to revolt\r\nagainst Peter, in consequence of the innovations he had introduced and\r\nthe expenses that he would be likely to entail upon them by a protracted\r\nwar.\r\n\r\nBut the people of Russia were well aware that mere personal ambition did\r\nnot enter into the scheme of Peter, and that, although he had broken\r\nthrough many antiquated and revered customs, yet that he had conferred\r\nsuch permanent benefits upon the empire as entitled him to their lasting\r\ngratitude. Whatever prospects of success, therefore, Charles might\r\nhave flattered himself upon deriving from the dissatisfaction of the\r\ngreat mass of the community were evidently vague and visionary. But\r\nthe argument was sufficient for all his purposes in helping to inspire\r\nhis soldiers with confidence. About this time the French envoy at the\r\ncourt of Saxony attempted to effect a reconciliation between Charles and\r\nthe czar, when the former made his memorable reply that he would treat\r\nwith Peter in Moscow; which answer being conveyed to Peter produced his\r\nequally memorable commentary--“My brother Charles wishes to play the part\r\nof Alexander, but he shall not find a Darius in me.”\r\n\r\nRapid preparations were made on both sides for the war which had now\r\nbecome inevitable. In the autumn of 1707 Charles commenced his march\r\nfrom Altranstadt, paying a visit to Augustus at Dresden as he passed\r\nthrough that city, and hastening onwards through Poland, where his\r\nsoldiers committed such devastations that the peasantry rose in arms\r\nagainst them. He finally fixed his winter quarters in Lithuania. During\r\nthe time occupied by these movements Peter was wintering at Moscow,\r\nwhere, after an absence of two years, he had been received with universal\r\ndemonstrations of affection. He was busily occupied in inspecting the new\r\nmanufactories that had been established in the capital, when news reached\r\nhim of the operations of the Swedish army. He immediately departed, and,\r\nwith six hundred of the guards established his headquarters in the city\r\nof Grodno. Charles no sooner heard of his arrival at that place than,\r\nwith his usual impetuosity, he hastened forwards with only eight hundred\r\nmen to besiege the town.\r\n\r\nBy a mistake, the life of Peter was nearly sacrificed. A German officer,\r\nwho commanded the gate towards which Charles approached, imagining that\r\nthe whole Swedish army was advancing, fled from his post and left the\r\npassage open to the enemy. General consternation prevailed throughout the\r\ncity as the rumour spread; and the victorious Charles, cutting in pieces\r\nthe few Russians who ventured to contest his progress, made himself\r\nmaster of the town. The czar, impressed with the belief that the report\r\nwas true, retreated behind the ramparts, and effected his escape through\r\na gate at which Charles had placed a guard. Some Jesuits, whose house,\r\nbeing the best in the town, was taken for the use of Charles, contrived\r\nin the course of the night to inform Peter of the real circumstances;\r\nupon which the czar re-entered the city, forced the Swedish guard, and\r\ncontended for possession in the streets. But the approach of the Swedish\r\narmy compelled him at last to retire, and to leave Grodno in the hands of\r\nthe conqueror.\r\n\r\nThe advance of the Swedes was now marked by a succession of triumphs;\r\nand Peter, finding that Charles was resolved to pursue him, and that\r\nthe invader had but five hundred miles to traverse to the capital, an\r\ninterval unprotected by any places of consequence, with the exception of\r\nSmolensk, conceived a masterly plan for drawing him into a part of the\r\ncountry where he could obtain neither magazines nor subsistence for his\r\narmy, nor, in case of necessity, secure a safe retreat. With this design\r\nhe withdrew to the right bank of the Dnieper,[40] where he established\r\nhimself behind sheltered lines, from which he might attack the enemy at\r\nan advantage, preserving to himself a free communication with Smolensk,\r\nand abundant means of retreat over a country that yielded plentiful\r\nresources for his troops.\r\n\r\nIn order to render this measure the more certain, he despatched General\r\nGoltz at the head of fifteen thousand men to join a body of twelve\r\nthousand Cossacks, with strict orders to lay waste the whole province for\r\na circle of thirty miles, and then to rejoin the czar at the position he\r\nhad taken up on the bank of the Dnieper. This bold movement was executed\r\nas swiftly as it was planned; and the Swedes, reduced to immediate\r\nextremity for want of forage, were compelled to canton their army until\r\nthe following May. Accustomed, however, to the reverses of war, they were\r\nnot daunted by danger or fatigue, but it was no longer doubtful that both\r\nparties were on the eve of decisive events. They regarded the future,\r\nhowever, with very different hopes. Charles, heated with victories, and\r\npanting for further acquisitions, surveyed the vast empire, upon the\r\nborders of which he now hung like a cloud, as if it were already within\r\nhis grasp; while Peter, more wary and self-possessed, conscious of the\r\nmagnitude of the stake for which he fought, and aware of the great\r\ndifficulties of his situation, occupied himself in making provision\r\nagainst the worst.[c]\r\n\r\n\r\nREVOLT OF THE COSSACKS OF THE DON; MAZEPPA\r\n\r\nMeantime there were foes at home that had demanded the attention of he\r\nczar.[a] The strelitz were not the only military body belonging to old\r\nRussia whose existence had become incompatible with the requirements of\r\na modern state. The undisciplined Cossack armies, which had hitherto\r\nformed a rampart for Russia against barbarian hordes, were also to\r\nundergo transformation. The empire had many causes of complaint against\r\nthe Cossacks, particularly those of the Ukraine and the Don who had\r\nformerly sustained the usurper, Dmitri, and from whose ranks had issued\r\nthe terrible Stenka Radzin.\r\n\r\nIn 1706 the Cossacks of the Don had revolted against the government\r\nof the czar because they were forbidden to give asylum in their camp\r\nto refugee peasants or taxpayers. The ataman Boulavine and his aids,\r\nNekrassov, Frolov, and Dranyi, called them to arms. They murdered Prince\r\nGeorge Dolgoruki, defeated the Russians on the Liskovata, took Tcherkask,\r\nand menaced Azov, all the while proclaiming their fidelity to the czar\r\nand accusing the voyevods of having acted without orders. They were\r\nin turn defeated by Vasili Dolgoruki, Bulavin was murdered by his own\r\nsoldiers and Nekrassov with only two thousand men took refuge in the\r\nKuban. After clearing out the rebel camps Dolgoruki wrote: “The chief\r\ntraitors and mutineers have been hung, together with one out of ten of\r\nthe others; and all the bodies have been placed on rafts and allowed to\r\ndrift with the current that the Dontsi may be stricken with terror and\r\nmoved to repent.”\r\n\r\nSince the disgrace of Samoilovitch, Mazeppa had been the hetman of the\r\nLittle Russian Cossacks in Ukraine. Formerly a page of John Casimir, king\r\nof Poland, he had in his youth experienced the adventure made famous\r\nby the poem of Lord Byron and the pictures of Horace Vernet. Loosened\r\nfrom the back of the untamed horse that fled with him to the deserts of\r\nUkraine, he at once took rank in the Cossack army, and rose by means of\r\ntreachery, practised against all the chiefs in turn, to fill the highest\r\nposts in the military service. His good fortune created for him numerous\r\nenemies; but the czar, who admired him for his intelligence and had faith\r\nin his fidelity, invariably delivered over to him his detractors. He put\r\nto death the monk Solomon for revealing his intrigues with Sophia and the\r\nking of Poland, and later denunciators shared the same fate.\r\n\r\nUkraine, meanwhile, was being undermined by various factions. In the\r\nCossack army there was always a Russian party, a party that wished to\r\nrestore the Polish domination, and a party which designed to deliver\r\nover the country to the Turks. In 1693 Petrik, a Turkish chief, invaded\r\nUkraine but failed in his attempts at subjugation. Moreover, profound\r\ndissent existed between the army and the sedentary populations of\r\nUkraine. The hetman was constantly scheming to make himself independent,\r\nthe officers of the army objected to rendering an account of their\r\nactions to others, and the soldiers wished to live at the country’s\r\nexpense without working or paying taxes. The farmers, who had founded\r\nthe agricultural prosperity of the country, the citizens in towns who\r\nwere not secure in the pursuit of their avocations, the whole peaceful\r\nand laborious population, in fact, longed to be free from this turbulent\r\nmilitary oligarchy and called upon the czar at Moscow to liberate them.\r\n\r\nMazeppa represented the military element in Ukraine and knew that he was\r\nodious to the quiet classes. The czar showered proofs of confidence upon\r\nhim, but Mazeppa had reason to fear the consolidation of the Russian\r\nstate. The burdens that the empire imposed upon the vassal state were\r\nday by day becoming heavier, and the war against Charles XII served to\r\nincrease them still more. There was everything to fear from the imperious\r\nhumour and autocratic pretensions of the czar, and the imminent invasion\r\nof the Swedes was certain to precipitate a crisis; either Little Russia\r\nwould become independent with the aid of strangers, or their defeat\r\non her soil would deal the death-blow to her prosperity and hopes for\r\nthe future. Knowing that the hour was approaching when he should be\r\nobliged to obey the white czar Mazeppa allowed himself to be drawn into\r\ncommunication with Stanislaus Leszczynski, the king of Poland elected\r\nby the Swedish party. The witty princess Dolskaia gave him an alphabet\r\nin cipher. Hitherto Mazeppa had given over to the czar all letters\r\ncontaining propositions of betrayal, just as the czar had surrendered to\r\nhim his accusers. On receiving the letters of the princess he remarked\r\nwith a smile: “Wicked woman, she wishes to draw me away from the czar.”\r\n\r\nWhen, however, the hand of the sister of Menshikov was refused to one\r\nof his cousins, when the Swedish war and the passage of Muscovite\r\ntroops limited his authority and increased taxation in his territory,\r\nwhen the czar sent urgent injunctions for the equipment of troops\r\nafter the European fashion, and he could feel the spirit of rebellion\r\nagainst Moscow constantly growing around him, he wrote to Leszczynski\r\nthat though the Polish army was weak in numbers it had his entire good\r\nwill. His confidant Orlik was in the secret of all these manœuvres, and\r\nseveral of his subordinates who had divined them undertook to denounce\r\nhim to the czar. The denunciation was very precise and revealed all\r\nthe secret negotiations with the emissaries of the king and of the\r\nprincess Dolskaia; but it failed before the blind confidence of the\r\nczar. Palei, one of the denunciators, was exiled to Siberia; Iskra and\r\nKotchonbei, the remaining two, were forced by torture to avow themselves\r\ncalumniators, and were then delivered over to the hetman and beheaded.\r\nMazeppa realised that good fortune such as his could not long endure, and\r\nthe malcontents urged upon him the consideration of the common safety.\r\nAt this juncture Charles XII arrived in the neighbourhood of Little\r\nRussia. “It is the devil who brings him here!” cried Mazeppa, and placed\r\nbetween his two powerful enemies he exerted all his craft to preserve\r\nthe independence of his little state without giving himself into the\r\nhands of either Charles XII or Peter the Great. When the latter invited\r\nhim to join the army he feigned illness; but Menshikov approaching\r\nsimultaneously with Charles XII, it was necessary to make a choice.\r\nMazeppa left his bed, rallied his most devoted Cossacks about him, and\r\ncrossed the Desna for the purpose of effecting a junction with the Polish\r\narmy. At this the czar issued a proclamation denouncing the treason of\r\nMazeppa, his alliance with the heretics, his plots to bring Ukraine once\r\nmore under vassalage to Poland and to restore the temples of God and the\r\nholy monasteries to the uniates. Mazeppa’s capital, Baturin, was taken by\r\nMenshikov and rased to the ground, his accomplices perished on the wheel\r\nor the scaffold.[g]\r\n\r\n\r\nMAZEPPA JOINS CHARLES XII; PULTOWA\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [1708-1709 A.D.]]\r\n\r\nMazeppa with his army passed over the Desna; his followers, however,\r\nbelieved they were being led against Charles, and deserted their hetman\r\nas soon as his views were known, because they had more to fear from\r\nPeter than to hope from Charles. The hetman joined the Swedes with only\r\nseven thousand men, but Charles prosecuted his march and despised every\r\nwarning. He passed the Desna; the country on the farther side became more\r\nand more desolate, and appearances more melancholy, for the winter was\r\none of the most severe; hundreds of brave Swedes were frozen to death\r\nbecause Charles insisted upon pursuing his march even in December and\r\nJanuary. The civil war in Poland in the mean time raged more violently\r\nthan ever, and Peter sent divisions of his Russians to harass and\r\npersecute the partisans of Stanislaus. The three men who stood in most\r\nimmediate relation to the Swedish king, Piper, Rehnskold, and Levenhaupt,\r\nbelonged, indeed, among the greatest men of their century; but they\r\nwere sometimes disunited in their opinions, and sometimes incensed and\r\nharassed by the obstinacy of the king.\r\n\r\nMazeppa fell a sacrifice to his connection with Charles, his residence\r\n(Baturin) was destroyed by Menshikov, and his faithful Cossacks, upon\r\nPeter’s demand, were obliged to choose another hetman (November, 1708).\r\nNeither Piper nor Mazeppa could move the obstinate king to relinquish his\r\nmarch towards the ill-fortified city of Pultowa. Mazeppa represented to\r\nhim in vain that, by an attack upon Pultowa he would excite the Cossacks\r\nof the Falls (Zaparogians) against him; and Piper entreated him, to no\r\npurpose, to draw nearer to the Poles, who were favourable to his cause,\r\nand to march towards the Dnieper; he continued, however, to sacrifice his\r\nmen by his march, till, in February (1709), a thaw set in.\r\n\r\nHe was successful in gaining the favour of the Zaparogians through their\r\nhetman, Horodenski; but fortune had altogether forsaken the Swedes since\r\nJanuary. In that month they were in possession of Moprik; in February,\r\nthe battles at Goronodek and Rashevka were decided in favour of the\r\nRussians; in March, Sheremetrev took Gaditch, which was occupied by the\r\nSwedes, and thereby gave a position to the Russian army which could not\r\nbut prove destructive to the Swedes, who were obliged to besiege Pultowa\r\nwithout the necessary means, because their intractable king insisted\r\nupon the siege. In April and May, the Swedes exerted themselves in vain\r\nin throwing up trenches before the miserable fortifications of Pultowa,\r\nwhilst the Russians were enclosing them in a net. One part of the\r\nRussians had already passed the Vorskla in May, and Peter had no sooner\r\narrived, in the middle of June, than the whole army passed the river, in\r\norder to offer a decisive engagement to the invaders.\r\n\r\nRehnskold acted as commander-in-chief at the battle of Pultowa; for\r\nCharles had received a dangerous wound in his foot ten days before, and\r\nwas unable to mount his horse. The Swedes on this day performed miracles\r\nof bravery, but everything was against them, for the Russians fought this\r\ntime at least for their country, and had at length gained experience\r\nin the field. The defeat of the Swedes is easily explained, when it is\r\nknown that they were in want of all the munitions of war, even powder\r\nand lead, that they were obliged to storm the enemy’s fortifications\r\nin opposition to an overwhelming numerical force, and that Levenhaupt\r\nand Rehnskold were so much disunited in opinion that the former, in his\r\nreport of the engagement at Pultowa, makes the bitterest complaints\r\nagainst the commander-in-chief, which have since that time been usually\r\nadopted by all historians. Of the whole Swedish army, only fourteen\r\nor fifteen thousand under Levenhaupt and Kreuz succeeded in erecting\r\nan ill-fortified camp on the Dnieper, where they were shut up by the\r\nRussians and the river.\r\n\r\nThis small force might possibly have succeeded in fighting its way into\r\nPoland, and Charles had at first adopted this determination; he was,\r\nhowever, with great trouble, induced to pass the Dnieper, and accompanied\r\nby a small guard, to take refuge in Turkey. His plan was to reach the Bug\r\nover the pasture lands which then belonged to the Tatars on the Black\r\nSea, and, aided by the Turks and the Tatars, to make his way first to\r\nOtchakov and then to Bender, whence he hoped to persuade the Turks to\r\ntake part in the Polish affairs. As soon as the king had escaped (July\r\n10th, 1709), Levenhaupt, mourning over the sacrifice which the wilfulness\r\nof Charles had brought upon his Swedes, concluded a capitulation, in\r\nvirtue of which all the baggage and artillery were surrendered to\r\nthe Russians, together with the remnant of the Swedish army, which,\r\ncalculating those who had been taken prisoners in the battle, amounted in\r\nall to about eighteen thousand men.\r\n\r\nCharles’ flight to Bender, and his long residence of five years in\r\nTurkey, were the most favourable events which could have occurred for\r\nthe accomplishment of Peter’s great plans. He was now master in Poland.\r\nIn the Swedish, German, and French adventurers who had been in Charles’\r\narmy, he received the very best instructors of his people. Among\r\nthose who entered into his service, there were experienced officers,\r\nartillerymen, architects, and engineers.\r\n\r\nThe Swedes, who for thirteen long years were neither set at liberty nor\r\naccorded by their impoverished country the usual support of prisoners\r\nof war, were distributed over the whole of Russia, and sent far into\r\nSiberia. They founded schools and institutions, in order to get a\r\nlivelihood, and used their knowledge and experience against their will\r\nfor the promotion of Peter’s designs. This was the more important, as\r\nthere was not a man among those many thousand prisoners who was not in a\r\ncondition to teach the Russians to whom he came something of immediate\r\nutility, drawn from his experience in his native land. Many never\r\nreturned to their homes, because they had raised up institutions and\r\ncommenced undertakings which were as advantageous to themselves as to the\r\nRussian Empire.[e]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PETER THE GREAT AT THE BATTLE OF PULTOWA\r\n\r\n(Painted for THE HISTORIANS’ HISTORY OF THE WORLD by Thure de\r\nThulstrup)]\r\n\r\n\r\nPETER AND THE POWERS\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [1711 A.D.]]\r\n\r\nA treaty was entered into by Poland, Prussia, and Denmark, which restored\r\nto those states the conquests of Gustavus Adolphus, and to Russia her\r\nsovereignty over her ancient possessions of Livonia, Ingria, and a part\r\nof Finland. When these preliminaries were settled, Peter went in person\r\nto make a defensive treaty with the elector of Brandenburg, the first\r\nking of Prussia; a mode of negotiation unusual amongst sovereigns,\r\nbut which was perfectly consistent with the individual character and\r\npromptitude of the czar. Having concluded these important plans, he\r\nproceeded to reduce some Swedish fortresses, and to bombard the town of\r\nRiga, the capital of Livonia, where he lost between nine and ten thousand\r\nmen by a pestilence that was then raging in that place. The garrison,\r\nstruck down by two enemies--the plague and the Russians, and scarcely\r\nable to decide which was the more fatal--speedily capitulated; and\r\nLivonia was once more rendered tributary to Muscovy.\r\n\r\nIn the meanwhile Charles was employing all his interest at Constantinople\r\nto prevail upon the sultan to undertake a war against Russia, which the\r\nsultan was easily induced to embrace, in consequence of the ravages\r\ncommitted by the Muscovite troops on the frontiers of Turkey, and the\r\nrapidly extending power of the czar on the sea of Azov and the Black\r\nSea. The khan of the Crimean Tatars naturally regarded with apprehension\r\nthe Russian establishment at Azov, which the Turks had been forced\r\nto surrender a few years before; and he, therefore, strengthened the\r\narguments that were submitted to the Divan to persuade them into a\r\ndeclaration of hostilities against the common enemy. A statement setting\r\nforth the formidable advances that Russia was making in her navy on the\r\nDon and in the harbour of Taganrog, and of the spirit of acquisition she\r\nwas constantly exhibiting in her encroachments upon the border lands, was\r\nlaid before the council by Poniatowski, the active friend of the Swedish\r\nking, and was immediately assented to by the mufti. In order to render\r\nthe views of the sultan still more impressive, Count Tolstoi, the czar’s\r\nambassador at Constantinople, was arrested in the public streets, and\r\ncommitted to the castle of the Seven Towers.\r\n\r\nThe indignity offered to Peter in the person of his minister was scarcely\r\nnecessary to inflame his irritable temper. Within a short space of\r\ntime his plenipotentiary in Saxony was broken on the wheel, and his\r\nambassador in London imprisoned for debt; but these events had taken\r\nplace before the battle of Pultowa, which suddenly elevated him to the\r\nhighest consideration amongst contemporary sovereigns. The insult,\r\ntherefore, which the sultan cast upon him by the arrest of Count Tolstoi\r\nwas the more acutely felt, as it appeared to treat him with contempt\r\nin the very hour of victory. He soon made the necessary arrangements\r\nfor the approaching war, sending one division of his army to Moldavia,\r\nanother to Livonia; and fleets to Azov, the Baltic, and the Black Sea.\r\nIt was necessary, however, to return to Moscow to make provision for\r\nthe government during his absence, and while he was there he issued a\r\nconscription for the purpose of recruiting his army.\r\n\r\n\r\nCATHERINE ACKNOWLEDGED AS PETER’S WIFE (1711 A.D.)\r\n\r\nThe time was now arrived for acknowledging before his subjects his\r\nmarriage with Catherine, which had taken place privately in 1707; and\r\naccordingly, on the 6th of March, 1711, the czarina Catherine Alexievna\r\nwas solemnly declared to be his legitimate wife. The ascendency which\r\nCatherine had acquired over him was not more extraordinary than it\r\nwas propitious. Peter’s disposition was naturally impatient and cruel,\r\nand when he was excited to acts of severity he could not be restrained\r\nby any appeal to his reason or his humanity. The only influence that\r\npossessed any permanent power over him was that of female society; and\r\nthe remarkably sweet temper of Catherine, who was never known to be out\r\nof humour, invariably tranquillised him, even in his most angry moods, so\r\ncomplete was the fascination she exercised over his mind that the agony\r\nof those spasmodic fits to which he was subject yielded to her soothing\r\npresence. Without forgetting the low condition from which she sprang, she\r\nmaintained the pomp of majesty with irreproachable propriety, and united\r\nan air of ease and authority that excited the admiration of those by\r\nwhom she was surrounded. She was not distinguished by that lofty beauty\r\nwhich would seem to sympathise with these august qualities; nor was she\r\neither very brilliant in conversation or of a very quick imagination, but\r\nshe was graceful and animated; her features were pretty and expressive,\r\nand a tone of good sense and kindness always pervaded her actions. She\r\nwas admirably formed for the sphere she embellished, and, above all,\r\nfor the peculiar necessities of the era that called her to the throne.\r\nHer devotion to Peter was boundless. She constantly attended him, even\r\nupon occasions of the utmost danger, and especially upon this eventful\r\nexpedition, when she accompanied him upon his campaign into Turkey.\r\n\r\n\r\nWAR WITH TURKEY\r\n\r\nThe whole body of troops which the precautions of the czar had enabled\r\nhim to collect amounted to 130,000 men; but, being distributed in\r\ndifferent quarters, and failing to join the czar on the Pruth, as he\r\nexpected, he was obliged to proceed with an army that fell short of\r\n40,000 men. The perils of the enterprise were so apparent that Peter\r\nissued orders requiring the women who followed in the train of the army\r\nto return; but Catherine, who insisted upon remaining with the czar,\r\nprevailed upon him to retract his determination. This slight circumstance\r\neventually proved to be the salvation of the czar and his empire.\r\n\r\nFrom Sorokat the army proceeded to Jassy, where Peter was led to expect\r\nsupplies from the prince of Wallachia, with whom he had entered into\r\na secret negotiation; but the sultan, warned of the prince’s intended\r\nrevolt, suddenly deposed him, and appointed Cantemir in his place. But\r\nCantemir, who was a Christian prince, was no less inclined to assist the\r\nczar, and proffered him such aid as he could command; admitting very\r\ncandidly, however, that his subjects were attached to the Porte,[41]\r\nand firm in their allegiance. In this extremity Peter found himself at\r\nthe head of a very inadequate force in the heart of a wild and rugged\r\ncountry, where the herbage was destroyed by swarms of locusts, and where\r\nit was impossible to procure provisions for the troops. The dangers of\r\nhis situation, however, offered a valuable test of the fidelity and\r\nendurance of the soldiers, who, although they suffered the most severe\r\nprivation, never uttered a single complaint.\r\n\r\nIn this state of things, intelligence was received that the Turkish\r\narmy had crossed the Danube, and was marching along the Pruth. Peter\r\ncalled a council of war, and declared his intention of advancing at\r\nonce to meet the enemy; in which measure all the generals, except one,\r\nexpressed their concurrence. The dissentient officer reminded the czar\r\nof the misfortunes of the king of Sweden in the Ukraine, and suggested\r\nto him the possibility that Cantemir might disappoint him; but Peter was\r\nresolved, and, after a fatiguing march for three nights over a desert\r\nheath, the troops arrived on the 18th of June at the river Pruth. Here\r\nthey were joined by Prince Cantemir, with a few followers, and they\r\ncontinued their march until the 27th, when they discovered the enemy,\r\nto the number of 200,000 men, already crossing the river. There was no\r\nalternative left but to form the lines of battle; and Peter, perceiving\r\nthat the enemy was endeavouring to surround him with cavalry, extended\r\nhis lines a considerable way along the right bank.\r\n\r\nThe situation of the army at this juncture was extremely unfortunate. The\r\ngreat body of the Turkish soldiers were before the Russians on one side\r\nof the river, and on the other the hostile Tatars of the Crimea. The czar\r\nwas thus completely surrounded, his means of escape by the river were cut\r\noff, and the great numbers of the Turks rendered a flight in the opposite\r\ndirection impossible. He was placed in more critical circumstances\r\nthan Charles at Pultowa, and he had been misled, like that unfortunate\r\nprince, by an ally who did not possess the power of fulfilling his\r\npromise. But his presence of mind and indomitable courage never forsook\r\nhim. He formed his army, which consisted in detail of 31,554 infantry,\r\nand only 6,692 cavalry, into a hollow square, placing the women in the\r\ncentre, and prepared to receive the disorderly but furious onslaught\r\nof the Turks. It is evident that, if the forces of the sultan had been\r\ncommanded by skilful officers, the contest must have been speedily\r\nterminated. But the superior discipline of the Russians was shown in the\r\nsteadiness with which they met the charge, and maintained themselves\r\nagainst such great odds. The Turks injudiciously confined their attack\r\nto one side of the square, by which, although the loss sustained by the\r\nRussians was immense, the czar was enabled constantly to relieve the\r\ntroops, and supply the front with fresh men. The fight continued for\r\nthree days. Their ammunition was at last exhausted, and there remained\r\nno choice between surrendering and making a desperate attempt to cut\r\ntheir way through the enemy. This latter proposition is said to have\r\nbeen entertained by Peter, who proposed to force a passage in the night,\r\naccompanied by his officers and a few select men; but it is extremely\r\nunlikely that he should have contemplated a step that must inevitably\r\nhave sacrificed the czarina and the remnant of his brave army.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Catherine’s Heroism; the Peace of Pruth_\r\n\r\nIt is not improbable, however, that Peter may have conceived some heroic\r\ndesign for forcing a passage; but the certainty of failure must have\r\noverruled such an intention almost as soon as it was formed. After the\r\nagitation of that eventful day, he surrendered himself to the anxiety by\r\nwhich he was oppressed, and, retiring to his tent on the third night,\r\ngave strict orders that he should be left undisturbed. It was on this\r\noccasion that the genius and influence of the czarina preserved the\r\nempire, her consort, and the army. She who had accompanied him through\r\nso many dangers, who had shared in the toils of the field without\r\nmurmuring, and partaken in the fatigues consequent upon his reforms\r\nand improvements, had a right to be heard at a moment of such critical\r\nimportance. In despite, therefore, of his prohibition she entered his\r\ntent, and representing to him the perils by which they were on all sides\r\nenvironed, urged upon him the necessity of seeking to negotiate a peace.\r\nShe not only suggested this measure, which was probably the very last\r\nthat might have occurred to Peter, but she undertook to carry it into\r\neffect herself. It is the immemorial custom in the East to approach all\r\nsovereigns, or their representatives, with presents, and Catherine, aware\r\nof that usage, collected all her own jewels and trinkets, and those of\r\nthe women who had accompanied the expedition, giving a receipt for their\r\nvalue to be discharged on their return to Moscow, and dispatched the\r\nvice chancellor, accompanied by an officer, with a letter from Marshal\r\nSheremetrev to the grand vizir, proposing negotiations for a treaty of\r\npeace.[42]\r\n\r\nSome hours elapsed, and no answer was returned. It was supposed that the\r\nbearers of the letter were put to death, or placed under arrest, when\r\na second officer was despatched with a duplicate of the letter, and it\r\nwas determined in a council of war, that, should the vizir refuse to\r\naccept the proffered terms, an attempt should be made to break through\r\nthe enemy’s ranks. With this view an intrenchment was rapidly formed,\r\nand the Russians advanced within a hundred paces of the Turkish lines. A\r\nsuspension of arms, however, was immediately proclaimed by the enemy, and\r\nnegotiations were opened for a treaty.\r\n\r\nIt would appear strange that the vizir should have consented to a\r\ncessation of hostilities under such circumstances, when the Russians were\r\ncompletely at his mercy; but he was aware that the Russian troops in\r\nMoldavia had advanced to the Danube after reducing the town of Brabilow,\r\nand that another division of the general army was on its march from the\r\nfrontiers of Poland. He, therefore, considered it advisable to avail\r\nhimself of that opportunity to dictate to Peter the terms upon which\r\nhe wished to terminate the campaign, knowing that if he postponed the\r\ntreaty he would be compelled to renew the war against the whole force of\r\nthe empire. The conditions he proposed were sufficiently humiliating.\r\nHe demanded the restitution of Azov, the demolition of the harbour of\r\nTaganrog, the renouncement of all further interference in the affairs\r\nof Poland and the Cossacks, a free passage for Charles back to his own\r\ncountry, and the withdrawal from the sea of Azov and the Black Sea. Peter\r\nsubscribed to all these conditions, but refused to deliver up Prince\r\nCantemir to the sultan, declaring that he would rather cede to the Turks\r\nthe whole country as far as Kursk than violate his word.\r\n\r\nThis treaty, however, did not satisfy the expectations of Charles; and,\r\nindeed, obtained for him scarcely any advantage. The only passage it\r\ncontained which directly related to him was that which bound Peter to\r\ngive him a safe return home, and to conclude a peace with him, if the\r\nterms could be agreed upon. He never ceased to importune the sultan to\r\ndismiss the vizir and make war upon Russia, until the Porte, wearied\r\nby his ungrateful and frantic complaints, at last recalled the pension\r\nallowed him, and sent him an order to leave the Turkish dominions. The\r\nsequel of that monarch’s career presents a series of acts that abundantly\r\njustify the suspicion that his mind was shattered by the reverses of\r\nfortune he had undergone; for, after remaining five years in Turkey, and\r\nventuring with a band of grooms and valets, secretaries and cooks to\r\nmake a stand against an army of janissaries, spahis, and Tatars he fled\r\nin the disguise of a courier to his own kingdom, where he had not been\r\nseen during that long interval and where his death had for some time been\r\ncurrently believed in.\r\n\r\nThe battle of the Pruth, so fatal in its results to Peter, was a very\r\ndestructive engagement. If the statements of the czar be correct, his\r\narmy, on the first day of the engagement, consisted of 31,554 infantry,\r\nand 6,692 cavalry, and was reduced on the last day to 22,000 men, which\r\nwould make his loss amount to 16,246. The loss sustained by the Turks was\r\nstill greater in consequence of their irregular and scattered method of\r\nattack. But numerical details cannot always be relied upon, since they\r\nare frequently modified to suit the views of one party or the other.\r\nThere can be no doubt, however, that the czar fought at an extraordinary\r\ndisadvantage, and that the losses on both sides were dreadful.\r\n\r\nWhen the treaty was concluded, Peter returned into Russia, causing\r\nthe fortresses of Samara and Kamenka to be demolished; but, as some\r\nunavoidable delay occurred in the surrender of Azov and Taganrog, the\r\nsultan became dissatisfied, and Peter entered into a fresh treaty,\r\nby which he pledged himself to evacuate Poland within three months;\r\nstipulating, however, that Charles, who was still intriguing with the\r\nDivan, should be required immediately to withdraw from Turkey. The\r\nfatigues of the campaign required repose; and Peter, who had suffered\r\nconsiderably by ill health, rested for some time at Carlsbad for the\r\nbenefit of the waters.\r\n\r\nWhen Peter returned to St. Petersburg, he again solemnised his wedding\r\nwith the czarina, and held a festival in that city which was remarkable\r\nfor its pomp and the expression it drew forth of the popular confidence.\r\nBut this was only the prelude to fresh labours. He renewed his plans\r\nfor the improvement of the country, laid down a number of new roads,\r\ncut several canals, enlarged his navy, and encouraged the erection of\r\nmore substantial dwellings in the new city. His ultimate design of\r\nestablishing St. Petersburg as the capital of the empire now gradually\r\ndeveloped itself; and the first open measure he adopted towards the\r\naccomplishment of that object was the removal of the senate from Moscow.\r\nThe commercial advantages the people had already gained through their\r\ncommunication with the Baltic had reconciled them to the change, and\r\nthe opposition with which the return had been originally received was\r\nnow considerably relaxed. But much remained yet to be done before the\r\nprosperity of the new capital could be secured. Resistance from without\r\nwas more to be apprehended than remonstrances at home; and Peter was not\r\nslow to act upon the necessity of circumstances.\r\n\r\n\r\nWAR WITH SWEDEN (1714 A.D.)\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [1714 A.D.]]\r\n\r\nThe possession of Pomerania, the most northerly of the German provinces,\r\nwas necessary to the projects of the czar, who desired as much to\r\nhumiliate the king of Sweden as to secure the safety of his establishment\r\non the embouchure of the Neva. Pomerania, which lies north and south\r\nbetween the Baltic and Mecklenburg, had passed through the hands of\r\nseveral masters, and had at last been ceded to Gustavus Adolphus in the\r\nThirty Years’ War. In order to render his design more certain, Peter\r\nentered into a league with the electors of Brandenburg and Hanover, and\r\nthe king of Denmark, drawing up the articles himself, and the details of\r\nthe necessary operations. Stralsund was first blockaded, and the allied\r\nforces proceeded along the Wismar road, followed at a distance by the\r\nSwedish troops under the command of Count Stenbock, who, coming up with\r\nthe Danish and Saxon divisions before the Russians had time to join\r\nthem, completely routed them in a few hours. This slight check to their\r\nprogress was soon repaired by a victory obtained by Peter over Stenbock\r\n(whose march was signalised by disgraceful excesses), in the little town\r\nof Altona, close to Hamburg, which he reduced to ashes.\r\n\r\nThe Russian army went into quarters for the winter, and the campaign\r\nwas again renewed with vigour in the following year, when Stenbock was\r\ncompelled to abandon the town of Tenningen, into which he had obtained\r\nentrance by the intrigues of Baron Görtz, one of the most crafty and\r\nunprincipled diplomatists of his age. Stenbock and eleven thousand Swedes\r\nsurrendered themselves prisoners of war, and although the ransom demanded\r\nfor the liberation of that general was only 8,000 imperial crowns, he was\r\nsuffered to linger in the dungeons of Copenhagen until the day of his\r\ndeath. Nearly the whole of Pomerania was overrun and partitioned amongst\r\nthe allies, scarcely a place remaining in the possession of Sweden\r\nexcept Stralsund, the siege of which Peter confided to Menshikov, while\r\nhe returned to St. Petersburg to make preparations for a descent upon\r\nHelsingfors in the gulf of Finland. His operations along the whole line\r\nof that coast were equally successful. He soon mastered Bergo and Åbo,\r\nthe capital; and, transferring to St. Petersburg from the latter town a\r\nmagnificent library, he raised a building for its reception, which still\r\nremains a witness to his enterprise and the spirit of improvement which\r\nseemed to preside over all his actions.\r\n\r\n\r\n_A Naval Victory; Peter’s Triumph_\r\n\r\nBut the Swedes, viewing the encroachments of the czar in Finland with\r\nterror, and resolving to spare no means to arrest his progress, fitted\r\nout a considerable squadron to cruise in the gulf. The czar, however,\r\nwas ready to meet them; and, setting sail from Kronstadt, fell in with\r\nthem close to the island of Åland, where, after a severe engagement, he\r\ndestroyed several of their ships, and took the admiral prisoner. The\r\nconsternation which the news of this victory spread over Sweden was so\r\ngreat that even Stockholm trembled for its safety.\r\n\r\nHis return to St. Petersburg on this occasion was an ovation of more\r\nthan ordinary magnificence. The czarina had just given birth to a\r\ndaughter; and, upon his triumphal entry, Peter instituted the order of\r\nSt. Catherine to commemorate his sense of her devotion and magnanimity.\r\nThe galleys of the conquerors and the conquered sailed up the Neva in\r\nprocession, and the czar, in his capacity of rear-admiral, presented\r\nto the senate a report of the battle, and was immediately created\r\nvice-admiral, amidst the rejoicings of the people. It was not the least\r\nremarkable feature in the character of this great man that he set the\r\nexample, in his own person, of ascending through the different grades of\r\nthe service by the force of his individual claims. At Pultowa he served\r\nas major-general, and in the action in the gulf of Finland he acted as\r\nrear-admiral, under the command of Admiral Apraxin. This precedent could\r\nnot fail to have due weight with a people who had been so long accustomed\r\nto oppression and the right of the strong hand. It had more effect in\r\ngenerating a spirit of emulation, and in eradicating the prejudices\r\nand vices of feudal slavery, than a code of the wisest laws could have\r\naccomplished.\r\n\r\nSt. Petersburg presented a scene of festivity such as had never been\r\nknown in Russia before. The intercourse of the people with other nations\r\nhad in a few years changed the whole character of society. Balls and\r\nentertainments, upon a large scale, diffused amongst the inhabitants\r\na taste for pleasures that had been hitherto unknown to them. Public\r\ndinners were given in the palace of the czar, to which all classes of\r\npersons were invited, and at which the different ranks were appropriately\r\ndivided at separate tables, the czar passing from table to table, freely\r\nconversing with his subjects on matters connected with their particular\r\ntrade or occupations. Civilisation was thus promoted in detail, and\r\ninsinuated in the most agreeable shape into the domestic usages of the\r\ncitizens.\r\n\r\n\r\nPETER AT THE HEIGHT OF POWER\r\n\r\nBut while amusements occupied a part of the czar’s time, he was not\r\nforgetful of the more important affairs that demanded consideration. The\r\nnecessity of establishing a naval force had always been apparent, and his\r\nrecent victories over the Swedes sufficiently testified the facility with\r\nwhich it might be rendered available for the ulterior projects which the\r\nextension and security of the empire required. He accordingly devoted\r\nmuch care to the subject, and in an incredibly short period was master\r\nof so large a fleet that he contemplated a descent upon Sweden, and even\r\ncalculated upon the possibility of entering Stockholm. Besides a variety\r\nof galleys and other vessels, he built fifty ships of war, which were all\r\nready for sea within a twelvemonth.\r\n\r\nThe discovery of some large peculations amongst the ministers and several\r\nfavourites of the court just at this juncture directed the czar’s\r\nproceedings, for a short time, into an unexpected channel. It appeared\r\nthat Menshikov, Apraxin, and others who held high offices of trust and\r\nresponsibility had, either by themselves or through their servants,\r\nembezzled a part of the finances of the empire; that the revenues were\r\nconsequently in a state of confusion, that trade was greatly deranged,\r\nand that the payments to the army had been made very irregularly. The\r\nministers, availing themselves of the new outlet for commerce, had\r\nmonopolised its chief advantages; and the Dutch merchants complained\r\nbitterly of a system by which they were deprived of the greater part\r\nof their profits. Peter at once established an inquisition into the\r\nfacts, and proceeded to act with the utmost rigour. He felt that the\r\nprosperity of his new capital depended mainly upon the justice with\r\nwhich its affairs were administered, and that its geographical position,\r\nwhich afforded it so complete a command of maritime resources, must\r\ncease to attract a foreign trade unless its fiscal officers possessed\r\nthe confidence of the merchants. Menshikov and the rest pleaded that\r\nthey had been engaged abroad in the service of the country, and could\r\nnot be aware of the malpractices of their servants. The czar admitted\r\nthat their plea was in some measure founded in justice; but, resolved\r\nto make an example, he confiscated the greater part of the property of\r\nthose whose agents were proved to be guilty. The estates of the remainder\r\nwere wholly forfeited; some individuals were sentenced to the knout, and\r\nothers were banished to Siberia. This measure was loudly called for by\r\nthe necessities of the case, and the inflexible honesty of the sovereign\r\nwas never exercised with a more beneficial result.\r\n\r\nThe unhappy wife of Alexis, who had been treated by her husband with the\r\nmost cruel neglect, expired in a few days after having given birth to a\r\nson, whose fortunes she committed to the guardianship of the czar. The\r\ncourt was plunged into deep affliction by this melancholy circumstance,\r\nand the czar in particular exhibited profound grief. But the birth of a\r\nprince to the czarina converted their mourning into congratulations, and\r\nthe most extravagant festivities were held in honour of the event.\r\n\r\nSt. Petersburg had now gradually become the capital of Russia. Foreign\r\nmerchandise imported at Archangel was prohibited from being sent to\r\nMoscow, and was consequently transmitted to St. Petersburg, which was\r\nthe residence of the court, of the principal nobility, and of all the\r\nambassadors from other powers, including at this period two from the\r\nEast. The rapidity with which its prosperity advanced was unparalleled.\r\nIts manufactures increased with its external trade, and it soon assumed\r\na rank equal to that of some of the most important cities in Europe. The\r\nfame and power of Peter were attaining their utmost height. Livonia,\r\nEsthonia, Karelia, Ingria, and nearly the whole of Finland were now\r\nannexed to the Russian Empire. He had established outlets to the sea by\r\nwhich he could communicate in security with civilised Europe; and within\r\nhis own territories he had created new establishments adapted to the\r\nvarious departments of industry, to the army, the navy, and the laws.\r\nPrince Galitzin occupied Finland with a disciplined army; generals Bruce\r\nand Bauer had the command of thirty thousand Russians, who were scattered\r\nthrough Poland; Marshal Sheremetrev lay in Pomerania with a large\r\nforce; Weimar had surrendered by capitulation, and all the sovereigns\r\nof the north were either his allies or his instruments. The dream of\r\nRussian aggrandisement appeared now to be realised almost in full by the\r\nsleepless activity and fertile genius of the czar. It was not surprising,\r\ntherefore, that the people of Stockholm daily expected that he would\r\nappear before their gates, and, taking advantage of the disasters of\r\ntheir fugitive monarch, reduce Sweden to subjection, as he had previously\r\nlaid waste the provinces that separated him from the coast of the Baltic\r\nSea on the one side, and the Black Sea on the other. He was master of\r\nboth shores of the gulf of Finland, and the possession of Sweden would\r\nhave given him the entire command of the Baltic and the gulf of Bothnia,\r\nover which, even as it was, his flag ranged in freedom. But Peter was too\r\npolitic to attempt at this juncture so enormous an extension of power. He\r\nwas aware of the jealousies which such a disposition must have excited in\r\nGermany and Poland, and he wisely contented himself with the acquisitions\r\nhe had already secured; suffering the headstrong Charles to bring his\r\nkingdom into greater jeopardy, in the hope, probably, that it might\r\nultimately fall to pieces by its own weakness.\r\n\r\nAt this crisis of affairs the unprincipled Görtz endeavoured to effect\r\na union between the two monarchs; and negotiations, having that object\r\nin view, were actually commenced, and might have been carried to a more\r\ndecisive conclusion but for events which diverted the attention of both\r\nsovereigns into other channels. Görtz has been blamed for projecting this\r\ntreaty of reconciliation, and accused of desiring to accomplish through\r\nits means a variety of results, such as the restoration of Pomerania to\r\nSweden and the crown of Poland to Stanislaus, the dethronement of the\r\nking of England, and, by a conspiracy against the duke of Orléans, the\r\nreduction of France under a Spanish regency. It is very probable that\r\nthe subtle minister might have contemplated some of these projects, that\r\nhe might have anticipated from the combined armies of the two northern\r\nheroes the rescue of Spain and the advancement of Alberoni, and that\r\nhe might have even calculated upon the cession of Pomerania and the\r\nrecognition of Stanislaus. But, as the adviser of Charles XII, he was\r\njustified in seeking an alliance which must in any case have greatly\r\nbenefited his master and protected his country against those imminent\r\ndangers that appeared to be impending over it at the moment; and if he\r\nlooked beyond immediate advantages, to remote contingencies, the design\r\nwas not, on that account, the less worthy of applause. As it was, it\r\nhad the effect of openly confirming the dispositions of Peter towards\r\nSweden, the czar declaring that he did not enter into war for the sake\r\nof glory, but for the good of the empire, and that he had no desire to\r\nexhibit any feelings of animosity against an enemy whom he had deprived\r\nof the power of doing mischief. Whatever faults may be charged upon\r\nGörtz--and there is no doubt that they were numerous enough--history\r\nmust pronounce his conduct upon this occasion to have been guided by a\r\nsagacious policy.\r\n\r\n\r\nPETER’S SECOND EUROPEAN TOUR (1717 A.D.)\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [1717 A.D.]]\r\n\r\nSatisfied with the circumstances of the empire, and anxious to improve\r\nhis knowledge of other nations, Peter now resolved to undertake a second\r\ntour through Europe. His first tour had been limited to practical\r\ninquiries into the useful arts; but his second was mainly addressed to\r\nan examination of the political systems of the European cabinets. When\r\nhe first left his own country to acquire information abroad, he was\r\nyoung, ardent, uninstructed, and undistinguished; but now he had achieved\r\na name that was famous all over the world, and he was regarded, with\r\njustice, as one of the most extraordinary persons of the age. During the\r\nnineteen years that had elapsed, in the interval, he had strengthened and\r\nenlarged his dominions, had traversed and subjugated many provinces, had\r\nsucceeded in accomplishing the great purposes of his wise ambition, and\r\nhad experienced amidst the splendid triumphs of his career some serious\r\nreverses, from which such a mind as his could not fail to extract useful\r\nadmonitions. He went forth, followed by the gratitude of Russia, to\r\nimprove his knowledge of the means by which he could contribute still\r\nmore largely to her prosperity. The czarina accompanied him upon this\r\njourney, but being in her third pregnancy she rested for a short time at\r\nSchwerin, whence she soon afterwards set out to rejoin her husband at\r\nHolland. On her way, however, she was again taken ill, and delivered at\r\nWesel of a prince, who died on the following day. This event, it appears,\r\ndid not delay her intention of meeting her husband in Holland, as we find\r\nthat in ten days afterwards she arrived in Amsterdam.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime Peter had visited Stralsund, Mecklenburg, Hamburg, and\r\nPyrmont, and subsequently proceeded to Copenhagen, where he was received\r\nwith great distinction by the king of Denmark. On this occasion, a\r\nsquadron of British ships, under the command of Sir John Norris, and a\r\nsquadron of Dutch ships, commanded by Rear-Admiral Grave, arrived at\r\nCopenhagen; and, it being understood that a Swedish fleet was out at sea,\r\nthe four armaments, Russian, Danish, Dutch, and English, united under the\r\nstandard of the czar, and put out to sea. Not falling in with the Swedes,\r\nwho had secured their safety in Karlskrona, the fleets separated, and\r\nPeter, taking leave of the court of Denmark, proceeded to Hamburg. This\r\nincident was always referred to by Peter as one of the most gratifying\r\ncircumstances of his life, and even his proudest victories appeared to\r\nafford him less pleasure than the recollection of the moment when he\r\nraised his flag as commander-in-chief of the united fleets.\r\n\r\nFrom Hamburg he continued his route to Lubeck, and had a private\r\ninterview with the king of Prussia at Havelberg, whence he returned\r\nby the Elbe to Hamburg. The anecdotes of his journey that have been\r\npreserved in a variety of personal memoirs are all calculated to show\r\nthe simplicity of his manners and his natural aversion to parade and\r\nceremony. At Nimeguen, where he arrived late at night in a common\r\npostchaise, accompanied by only two attendants, he is said to have supped\r\nupon poached eggs and a little bread and cheese, for which the landlord\r\ncharged 100 ducats the next morning. Peter remonstrated against the\r\ndemand, and inquired if eggs were so very scarce in that place. “No,”\r\nreplied the landlord, “but emperors are.” Peter paid the bill, and was\r\nwell satisfied to have purchased such a hint of European tactics at so\r\nsmall a rate.\r\n\r\nAt Amsterdam he was received with a feeling of delight almost approaching\r\nidolatry. The people regarded him as their pupil in the arts of commerce\r\nand ship-building; and shared in the glories of the victor of Pultowa, as\r\nif he were one of themselves. Nor did Peter hesitate in putting them as\r\nmuch at their ease in his presence as he had done when he had formerly\r\nlived amongst them, working like themselves and participating in their\r\nhard labour and rude fare. The cottage in which he had resided when he\r\nwas learning the art of ship-building he now found just as he had left\r\nit, but distinguished by the name of the Prince’s House, and preserved in\r\norder by the affectionate people with unabated interest. Upon entering\r\nthis humble scene, he was deeply affected, and desired to be left alone.\r\nThe recollections that pressed upon him at that moment were not amongst\r\nthe least impressive of his busy life.\r\n\r\nHis residence in Holland, where he remained for three months, exhibited\r\na succession of trivial incidents connected with his former associates,\r\nall of whom were recognised by the czar with the greatest cordiality;\r\nbut while he was thus engaged in revisiting the dockyards, in examining\r\nmodels, and receiving small tokens of popular attachment, he was not\r\nindifferent to matters of higher importance. The Hague, from the time of\r\nthe Peace of Nimeguen, had acquired the reputation of being the centre of\r\nthe negotiations of Europe, and was crowded with travellers and foreign\r\nministers. The foundations of a European revolution were then being laid\r\nin the diplomatic circles of that place; and the czar prolonged his stay\r\nin the Netherlands, with a view to assure himself more clearly of the\r\nstate of parties in the south and in the north, and to prepare for the\r\nside which, in the course of time, it might become advisable for him to\r\ntake.\r\n\r\nKeeping himself aloof from the intrigues by which he was surrounded, and\r\navailing himself of all the opportunities within his reach of improving\r\nhis information respecting the state of Europe, he proceeded to fulfil\r\nhis intention of visiting France, after he had satisfied his curiosity\r\nin Holland. Vast preparations, worthy of the occasion, were made in\r\nFrance for his reception; but Peter, with his accustomed contempt of\r\nsplendour, desired to avoid the display as much as possible. Accompanied\r\nby four gentlemen, he outstripped the escorts, and entered Paris without\r\nostentation. His journey was a succession of fêtes; wherever he appeared\r\nhe was treated with magnificence. His fame had penetrated the haunts of\r\nart and science, as well as the halls of palaces; portraits of himself\r\nand the czarina, medals with flattering inscriptions, and the most\r\ningenious devices, representing some of the events of his life, started\r\nup before him in places where he least expected to meet such evidences of\r\nhis greatness. He stepped in the midst of triumphs, and renewed, in his\r\novation at the French capital, the whole history of his glories as a hero\r\nand a legislator. But he could not be flattered out of his simplicity.\r\nDeclining the offers of the court, he retired to a private hotel in\r\na remote quarter of the town, in order that he might employ his time\r\nagreeably to his own wishes, instead of being trammelled by the fatiguing\r\nand idle ceremonies of the Louvre.\r\n\r\nHe left Catherine behind him in Holland on this occasion, apprehending\r\nthat the witty court of France, with its sarcasms and its ceremonials,\r\nmight possibly wound by neglect the delicacy of a woman whose greatness\r\nof soul elevated her above the conventions of the palace. The marriage\r\nof Louis XIV with Madame de Maintenon bore some resemblance, it is\r\ntrue, to his own union with Catherine; but Madame de Maintenon was an\r\naccomplished person, and Catherine’s merits were of a different order.\r\nCatherine was a heroine, Madame de Maintenon a fascinating woman.\r\nCatherine had perilled life by the side of her husband, from the Pruth\r\nto the Baltic, upon land and sea; Madame de Maintenon, retreating from\r\npolitical display, was content to attest her devotion, and preserve\r\nher supremacy, in retirement. Catherine was of obscure origin, Madame\r\nde Maintenon was of noble birth; and while the czarina was publicly\r\nacknowledged by Peter, Madame de Maintenon became the wife of Louis XIV\r\nin private. Yet, although Peter determined not to risk the feelings of\r\nthe czarina in the French court, especially as the death of Louis XIV had\r\nremoved Madame de Maintenon from the position which she had previously\r\nheld, the last wish he expressed on leaving Paris was to see that\r\ncelebrated woman, the widow of the king.\r\n\r\nPeter was not only a practical artist, but was well acquainted with\r\nthose sciences upon which the practical arts are based. He possessed\r\na mathematical mind and a skilful hand. The rapidity with which he\r\naccumulated knowledge could be paralleled only by the tenacity with\r\nwhich he retained it, and the facility with which he could employ it as\r\nthe occasion served. At the Academy of Sciences they placed before him,\r\namongst other curiosities, a map of Russia, which he instantly discovered\r\nto be full of errors, and pointed out to the exhibitors the mistakes\r\nthey had made in the geography of his dominions, and of the tracts on\r\nthe borders of the Caspian Sea. He afterwards accepted at their hands\r\nthe honour of being admitted as a member of their body. He visited the\r\nmanufactories and mercantile depots, and carried away all the information\r\nhe could glean from them; had several private conferences with the French\r\nministers in relation to the subsisting peace between the northern\r\npowers; and drew up the minutes of a treaty of commerce, which he caused\r\nto be shaped into regular form, and negotiated on his return to St.\r\nPetersburg.\r\n\r\nEvery moment was filled with business. He visited the tapestry of\r\nthe Gobelins, the carpets of the Savonnerie, the residences of the\r\ngoldsmiths, painters, sculptors, and mathematical instrument makers; and\r\nso far overcame his scruples against appearing in public that he went to\r\nsee the French parliament, and attended public worship on two occasions\r\nin state. Amongst the objects that extracted unbounded admiration from\r\nhim was the tomb of Cardinal Richelieu, one of the richest specimens\r\nof sculpture in Paris. But it was not on account of the glories of the\r\nchisel that it occupied his attention. He is said to have exclaimed, upon\r\nseeing it, “Great man! I would have given half of my empire to learn of\r\nthee how to govern the other half!”\r\n\r\nHaving satisfied his curiosity in France, he took his leave of that\r\ncountry, carrying with him several artisans for the purpose of\r\nestablishing their different crafts in Russia. During the period of\r\nhis short residence in the French capital he inspired a universal\r\nsentiment of respect. Although he did not hesitate to protest against\r\nthe luxurious extravagance of the court, and even carried the expression\r\nof his opinions so far as to say that he “grieved for France and its\r\ninfant king, and believed that the latter was on the point of losing his\r\nkingdom through luxury and superfluities”; yet the witty and satirical\r\ncourtiers, who observed him closely, were compelled to bear testimony\r\nto the magnanimity of his nature. Contemporary criticism is of so much\r\nvalue in the attempt to determine historical character that the opinions\r\nwhich were pronounced concerning him at this period cannot be excluded\r\nfrom the estimate which posterity will make of his faults and merits.\r\nLouville,[l] who was attached to the court, describes him thus:\r\n\r\n“His deportment is full of dignity and confidence, as becomes an absolute\r\nmaster. He has large and bright eyes, with a penetrating and occasionally\r\nstern glance. His motions, which are abrupt and hasty, betray the\r\nviolence of his passions and the impetuosity of his disposition; his\r\norders succeed each other rapidly and imperiously; he dismisses with\r\na word, with a sign, without allowing himself to be thwarted by time,\r\nplace, or circumstance, now and then forgetting even the rules of\r\ndecorum; yet with the regent and the young king he maintains his state,\r\nand regulates all his movements according to the points of a strict and\r\nproud etiquette. For the rest, the court discovered in him more great\r\nqualities than bad ones; it considered his faults to be merely trivial\r\nand superficial. It remarked that he was usually sober, and that he\r\ngave way only now and then to excessive intemperance; that, regular in\r\nhis habits of living, he always went to bed at nine o’clock, rose at\r\nfour, and was never for a moment unemployed; and, accordingly, that\r\nhe was well-informed, and seemed to have a better knowledge of naval\r\naffairs and fortification than any man in France.” The writers of that\r\nperiod, who possessed the best opportunities of becoming acquainted\r\nwith his movements, speak in terms of admiration of the experienced\r\nglance and skilful hand with which he selected the objects most worthy\r\nof admiration, and of the avidity with which he examined the studios of\r\nthe artists, the manufactories, and the museums. The searching questions\r\nwhich he put to learned men afforded sufficient proof, they observe,\r\nof the sagacity of a capacious mind, which was as prompt to acquire\r\nknowledge as it was eager to learn.\r\n\r\nThe journey of the czar through France, to rejoin the czarina at\r\nAmsterdam, was distinguished by the same insatiable love of inquiry.\r\nSometimes he used to alight from his carriage, and wander into the fields\r\nto converse with the husbandmen, taking notes of their observations,\r\nwhich he treasured up for future use. The improvement of his empire was\r\nalways present to his thoughts, and he never suffered an occasion to pass\r\naway, however trivial, from which he could extract a practical hint,\r\nwithout turning it to account. His activity appeared to be incapable\r\nof fatigue. From Amsterdam, accompanied by Catherine, he passed on to\r\nPrussia. Upon his arrival at Berlin he went at once to a private lodging;\r\nbut the king sending his master of the ceremonies to attend upon him, the\r\nczar informed that officer that he would wait upon his majesty the next\r\nday at noon. Two hours before the time, a magnificent cortège of royal\r\ncarriages appeared before the door of the czar’s lodging; but when noon\r\narrived, they were informed that the czar was already with the king.\r\nHe had gone out by a private way, to avoid the magnificence which he\r\nregarded as an impediment to action.\r\n\r\nThe character of Frederick of Prussia was distinguished by the same\r\nblunt, persevering, military qualities which belonged to that of\r\nPeter. He lived plainly, dressed like a common soldier, was extremely\r\nabstemious, and exhibited in his habits even a needless severity of\r\ndiscipline. The meeting, therefore, between sovereigns who so closely\r\nresembled each other in their tastes, who were equally self-devoted\r\nto the good of their people, and equally uncorrupted by the pomp and\r\ntemptations of power, was a spectacle such as history rarely presents.\r\nThe czarina was worthy of entering into the scene, for she was the only\r\nfemale sovereign in Europe who could share, without shrinking, the toils\r\nand difficulties of their career. Voltaire remarks that if Charles XII\r\nhad been admitted to the group, four crowned heads would have been seen\r\ntogether, surrounded by less luxury than a German bishop or a Roman\r\ncardinal.\r\n\r\nBut, while Peter, Catherine, and Frederick entertained an utter contempt\r\nfor ostentatious display, the fashion of the court, which was probably\r\ndirected by the queen, rendered it necessary that the illustrious\r\nvisitors should be treated with a show of grandeur and parade which\r\nthey despised. They were entertained in a costly style at the palace;\r\nand their manners did not fail to excite the sarcasms and gossip of the\r\ncourtiers, who were incapable of comprehending the real dignity of their\r\ncharacter, and who were disappointed to find in the czar and czarina\r\nof Russia a couple of plain, rough, and, agreeably to their notions,\r\nvulgar persons. The particulars of this visit to the court of Prussia\r\nare minutely commemorated in the loose and satirical memoirs of the day;\r\nwhile the visits to Paris, Amsterdam, and London are recorded, without\r\na single exception, in a spirit of grave admiration, that exhibits a\r\ncurious contrast to the flippant tracasseries of Berlin.\r\n\r\nAmongst the most pert and lively writers who chronicled the visit and\r\ncaricatured the czar and his simple train of followers, is the markgräfin\r\nvon Bayreuth. She gives a very amusing account in her memoirs of the\r\nreception at court; and says that when Peter approached to embrace the\r\nqueen, her majesty looked as if she would rather be excused. Their\r\nmajesties were attended, she informs us, by a whole train of what were\r\ncalled ladies, as part of their suite, consisting chiefly of young\r\nGerman women, who performed the part of ladies’ maids, chamber-maids,\r\ncook-maids, and washerwomen; almost every one of whom had a richly\r\nclothed child in her arms. The queen, it is added, refused to salute\r\nthese creatures. At table the czar was seized with one of his convulsive\r\nfits, at a moment when he happened to have a knife in his hand, and the\r\nqueen was so frightened that she attempted to leave the table; but Peter\r\ntold her not to be uneasy, assuring her that he would do her no harm. On\r\nanother occasion, he caught her by the hand with such force that she was\r\nobliged to desire him to be more respectful; on which he burst out into a\r\nloud fit of laughter, and said that she was much more delicate than his\r\nCatherine. But the most entertaining part of the whole is a sketch of the\r\npersonal appearance of the uncultivated sovereigns. “The czarina,” says\r\nthe markgräfin, “is short and lusty, remarkably coarse, and without grace\r\nor animation. One needs only see her to be satisfied of her low birth.\r\nAt the first blush one would take her for a German actress. Her clothes\r\nlooked as if bought at a doll-shop, everything was so old-fashioned\r\nand so bedecked with silver and tinsel. She was decorated with a dozen\r\norders, portraits of saints, and relics, which occasioned such a clatter\r\nthat when she walked one would suppose an ass with bells was approaching.\r\nThe czar, on the contrary, is tall and well made. His countenance is\r\nhandsome; but there is something in it so rude that it inspires one\r\nwith dread. He was dressed like a seaman, in a frock, without lace or\r\nornament.” The spirit of the tiring-woman shines through the whole of\r\nthis saucy and superficial description. The markgräfin took the measure\r\nof the illustrious visitors as she would of her lady’s robe--colour,\r\nspangles, and shape. It never occurred to her that, in the little coarse\r\nwoman who looked so like a German actress, she saw the heroine of the\r\nPruth; and that the rude seaman who frightened the queen was the man\r\nwho, amidst ignorant wonder and superstitious resistance, laid the\r\nfoundations of the most gigantic empire that the world has ever seen! But\r\nthe circumstances under which the markgräfin obtained her impressions\r\nwere unfavourable to the formation of a just opinion, or, indeed, of any\r\nopinion at all. She was only eight years of age when she saw Peter and\r\nCatherine, although she had arrived at a mature age when she wrote her\r\nmemoirs. She retained no more than the silly whispers and jests of the\r\nante-chamber. She noted down what she heard rather than what she thought;\r\nbut it serves to show very clearly the sort of atmosphere in which the\r\neccentric Frederick moved, and the courtly weaknesses against which,\r\nin his own person, he must have been compelled to sustain a continual\r\nwarfare.\r\n\r\nOn Peter’s return through Holland, he purchased a variety of pictures of\r\nthe Dutch and Flemish schools, several zoölogical, entomological, and\r\nanatomical cabinets, and a large collection of books. With the treasures\r\nthus accumulated he laid the foundation of the imperial Academy of\r\nSciences, the plan of which he drew up himself. He would probably have\r\nlingered longer in those countries, but for the intelligence which he\r\nreceived concerning the conduct of his son Alexis, which induced him to\r\nhasten to St. Petersburg under the agitation of bitter feelings, in which\r\nthe natural dispositions of the father were drawn into direct collision\r\nwith the duty of the sovereign.[c]\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CZAREVITCH ALEXIS DISINHERITED (1718 A.D.)\r\n\r\nThe czar arrived at St. Petersburg from his foreign tour on the 21st of\r\nOctober, 1717. Twenty years before he had signalised his return from\r\na first visit to civilised countries by the inhuman butchery of the\r\nstrelitz, and now he was about to give still more appalling evidence of\r\nthe deep depravity of his heart.\r\n\r\nPeter’s early aversion to Eudoxia had a most deplorable influence on\r\nAlexis, the son she bore him in 1690. The dissensions between the\r\nfather and the mother speedily diminished the father’s affection for\r\nAlexis. Moreover, as Peter’s vast labours prevented him from paying much\r\nattention to the education of his son, Alexis at first grew up under\r\nfemale tuition, and then fell into the hands of some of the clergy, under\r\nwhose guidance he daily conceived a greater abhorrence for his father.\r\nThis being observed by Peter, he put an end to the spiritual education,\r\nand appointed Menshikov superintendent of the prince’s preceptors.\r\n\r\nMenshikov was no friend to Alexis, and the latter had been early inspired\r\nby his mother with contempt and aversion for the favourite of his\r\nfather. The tutors who were now placed about the prince were not able\r\nto eradicate the prejudices impressed on his mind from his infancy,\r\nand now grown inveterate; besides, he had an unconquerable dislike to\r\nthem as foreigners. The future sovereign of so vast an empire that was\r\nnow reformed in all its parts, and by prosperous wars still further\r\nenlarged; the heir of a throne whose possessor ruled over many millions\r\nof people, had been brought up from his birth as if designed for a\r\nRussian bishop; theology continued to be his favourite study. With a\r\ncapacity for those sciences which are useful in government, he discovered\r\nno inclination to them. Moreover, he addicted himself early in life to\r\ndrunkenness and other excesses. There were not wanting such as flattered\r\nhis perverse dispositions, by representing to him that the Russian nation\r\nwas dissatisfied with his father, that it was impossible for him to be\r\nsuffered long in his career of innovation, that even his life was not\r\nlikely to hold out against so many fatigues, with many other things of a\r\nlike nature.\r\n\r\nThe conduct of Alexis, particularly his indolence and sloth, were highly\r\ndispleasing to Peter. Menshikov, from political motives, to preserve\r\nhimself and Catherine, was constantly employed in fanning the czar’s\r\nresentment, while the adherents of Alexis, on the other hand, seized\r\nevery opportunity to increase the aversion of the prince, who, from his\r\nvery cradle, had never known what it was to love, and had only dreaded\r\nhis father. Alexis at times even gave plain intimations that he would\r\nhereafter undo all that his father was so sedulously bringing about. Nay,\r\nwhen the latter, in 1711, appointed the prince regent during his absence,\r\nin the campaign of the Pruth, Alexis made it his first business to alter\r\nmany things in behalf of the clergy, so as clearly to evince in what\r\nschool he had been brought up.\r\n\r\nThe czar was in hopes of reforming his son by uniting him with a\r\nworthy consort; but even this attempt proved fruitless. The princess\r\nof Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel, who was selected for his bride, and to\r\nwhom Alexis was married at Torgau, in 1711, notwithstanding all her\r\neminent qualities of mind and heart and her great beauty, could make no\r\nimpression on him, and sank under the load of grief brought on by this\r\nunhappy connection, soon after giving birth to a prince, who was called\r\nby the name of his grandfather, Peter (1715). By a continuance in his\r\ndissolute mode of life, by his bad behaviour towards his spouse, and his\r\nintercourse with persons who were notorious for their hatred of Peter and\r\nhis reforms, Alexis seemed bent upon augmenting his father’s displeasure.\r\n\r\nAfter the death of the princess, Peter wrote his son a letter, the\r\nconclusion of which ran thus: “I will still wait awhile, to see if you\r\nwill amend; if not, know that I will deprive you of the succession, as a\r\nuseless limb is cut off. Do not imagine I am only frightening you; nor\r\nwould I have you rely on the title of being my eldest son; for since I\r\ndo not spare my own life for the good of my country and the prosperity\r\nof my people, why should I spare yours? I shall rather commit them to a\r\nstranger deserving such a trust than to my own undeserving offspring.”\r\n\r\nAt this very juncture the empress Catherine was delivered of a prince,\r\nwho died in 1719. Whether the above letter disheartened Alexis, or\r\nwhether it was imprudence or bad advice, he wrote to his father that he\r\nrenounced the crown, and all hopes of reigning. “God is my witness,” said\r\nhe, “and I swear upon my soul, that I will never claim the succession;\r\nI commit my children into your hands, and for myself desire only a\r\nsubsistence during life.”\r\n\r\nHis father wrote to him a second time. “I observe,” says he, “that all\r\nyou speak of in the letter is the succession, as if I stood in need\r\nof your consent. I have represented to you what grief your behaviour\r\nhas given me for so many years, and not a word do you say of it; the\r\nexhortations of a father make no impression on you. I have brought\r\nmyself to write to you once more; but for the last time. If you despise\r\nmy counsels now I am living, what regard will be paid to them after my\r\ndeath? Though you may now mean not to violate your promises, yet those\r\nbushy beards will be able to wind you as they please, and force you to\r\nbreak your word. It is you those people rely on. You have no gratitude to\r\nhim who gave you life. Since you have been of proper age, did you ever\r\nassist him in his labours? Do you not find fault with, do you not detest\r\neverything I do for the good of my people? I have all the reason in the\r\nworld to believe that, if you survive me, you will overthrow all that I\r\nhave been doing. Amend, make yourself worthy of the succession, or turn\r\nmonk. Let me have your answer either in writing, or personally, or I will\r\ndeal with you as a malefactor.”\r\n\r\nThough this letter was harsh, the prince might easily have answered\r\nthat he would alter his behaviour; but he only acquainted his father,\r\nin a few lines, that he would turn monk. This assurance did not appear\r\nnatural; and it is something strange that the czar, going to travel,\r\nshould leave behind him a son so obstinate, but this very journey proves\r\nthat the czar was in no manner of apprehension of a conspiracy from\r\nhis son. He went to see him before he set out for Germany and France;\r\nthe prince being ill, or feigning to be so, received him in bed, and\r\nconfirmed to him, by the most solemn oaths, that he would retire into a\r\nconvent. The czar gave him six months for deliberation, and set out with\r\nhis consort.\r\n\r\nHe had scarcely reached Copenhagen when he received advice (which was no\r\nmore than he might well expect) that Alexis admitted into his presence\r\nonly evil-minded persons, who humoured his discontent; on this the czar\r\nwrote to him that he must choose the convent or the throne, and, if he\r\nvalued the succession, to come to him at Copenhagen.\r\n\r\nThe prince’s confidants instilled into him a suspicion that it would be\r\ndangerous for him to put himself into the hands of a provoked father\r\nand a mother-in-law, without so much as one friend to advise with. He\r\ntherefore feigned that he was going to wait on his father at Copenhagen,\r\nbut took the road to Vienna, and threw himself on the protection of the\r\nemperor Charles VI, his brother-in-law, intending to continue at his\r\ncourt till the czar’s death.\r\n\r\nThis was an adventure something like that of Louis XI, who, whilst he was\r\ndauphin, withdrew from the court of Charles VII, his father, to the duke\r\nof Burgundy. Louis was, indeed, much more culpable than the czarevitch,\r\nby marrying in direct opposition to his father, raising troops, and\r\nseeking refuge with a prince, his father’s natural enemy, and never\r\nreturning to court, not even at the king’s repeated entreaties.\r\n\r\nAlexis, on the contrary, had married purely in obedience to the czar’s\r\norder, and had not revolted nor raised troops; neither, indeed, had he\r\nwithdrawn to a prince in anywise his father’s enemy; and, on the first\r\nletter he received from his father, he went and threw himself at his\r\nfeet. For Peter, on receiving advice that his son had been at Vienna, and\r\nhad removed thence to Naples, then belonging to the emperor Charles VI,\r\nsent Romanzov, a captain of the guards, and Tolstoi, a privy-councillor,\r\nwith a letter in his own hand, dated from Spa, the 21st of July, N.S.\r\n1717. They found the prince at Naples, in the castle of St. Elmo, and\r\ndelivered him the letter, which was as follows:\r\n\r\n“I now write to you, and for the last time, to let you know that you had\r\nbest comply with my will, which Tolstoi and Romanzov will make known to\r\nyou. On your obedience, I assure you, and promise before God, that I will\r\nnot punish you; so far from it, that if you return I will love you better\r\nthan ever. But if you do not, by virtue of the power I have received from\r\nGod as your father, I pronounce against you my eternal curse; and as your\r\nsovereign, I assure you I shall find ways to punish you; in which I hope,\r\nas my cause is just, God will take it in hand, and assist me in revenging\r\nit. Remember further that I never used compulsion with you. Was I under\r\nany obligation to leave you to your own option? Had I been for forcing\r\nyou, was not the power in my hand? At a word, I should have been obeyed.”\r\n\r\nRelying on the faith thus solemnly given by a father and a sovereign,\r\nAlexis returned to Russia. On the 11th of February, 1717, N.S., he\r\nreached Moscow, where the czar then was, and had a long conference in\r\nprivate with his father. A report immediately was spread through the city\r\nthat a reconciliation had taken place between the father and son, and\r\nthat everything was forgotten; but the very next day the regiments of\r\nguards were ordered under arms, and the great bell of Moscow tolled. The\r\nboyars and privy-councillors were summoned to the castle: the bishops,\r\nthe archimandrites, and two monks of the order of St. Basil, professors\r\nof divinity, met in the cathedral. Alexis was carried into the castle\r\nbefore his father without a sword, and as a prisoner; he immediately\r\nprostrated himself, and with a flood of tears delivered to his father a\r\nwriting, in which he acknowledged his crimes, declared himself unworthy\r\nof the succession, and asked only his life. The czar, raising him up, led\r\nhim to a closet, where he put several questions to him, declaring, that\r\nif he concealed anything relating to his escape, his head should answer\r\nfor it. Afterwards the prince was brought back into the council-chamber,\r\nwhere the czar’s declaration, which had been drawn up beforehand, was\r\npublicly read.\r\n\r\nThe father in this piece reproached his son with his manifold vices, his\r\nremissness in improving himself, his intimacy with the sticklers for\r\nancient customs, his misbehaviour towards his consort: “He has,” says\r\nhe, “violated conjugal faith, taking up with a low-born wench whilst his\r\nwife was living.” Alexis might fairly have pleaded that in this kind\r\nof debauchery he came immeasurably short of his father’s example. He\r\nafterwards reproaches him with going to Vienna, and putting himself under\r\nthe emperor’s protection. He says that Alexis had slandered his father,\r\nintimating to the emperor Charles VI that he was persecuted; and that a\r\nlonger stay in Muscovy was dangerous, unless he renounced the succession;\r\nnay, that he went so far as to desire the emperor openly to defend him by\r\nforce of arms.[e]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Death of the Czarevitch Alexis_\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [1718 A.D.]]\r\n\r\nThe proceedings against the czarevitch and his friends lasted for about\r\nhalf a year: they were begun in Moscow and continued in St. Petersburg;\r\nthe cells of the fortress of the latter place were filled with prisoners,\r\namongst whom were two members of the royal family--the czarevitch\r\nand Marie Alexievna; fresh persons were continually added to their\r\nnumber, denounced under the pressure of unbearable tortures. One of the\r\ndifferences between the legal proceedings of that period and the present\r\nconsists in the fact that, when we now have the evidence of a crime\r\nbefore us, we endeavour to discover the persons guilty of it, whereas\r\nthen they sought to find out whether someone had not done something\r\ncriminal.\r\n\r\nIn May a “declaration” or manifesto was issued setting forth the\r\nczarevitch’s crimes. His whole life was related in the manifesto;\r\nmention was made of his idleness in studying, his disobedience to his\r\nfather’s will, his ill treatment of his wife, and finally his flight and\r\nhis apparent solicitation of the help of the German emperor and “the\r\nprotection of an armed hand,”--which was not at all clearly proved by the\r\nevidence. There was, however, no mention in the manifesto of the fact\r\nthat he had been promised an unconditional pardon and the permission to\r\nlive at a distance with his beloved Euphrosyne. For all these offences,\r\nfor his disobedience to his father, his treachery and dissimulation, the\r\nczarevitch and his “accomplices” were delivered up for judgment to the\r\ntribunal; but this tribunal was not an ordinary one: it was a special\r\none, composed of persons named by Peter himself. Why was such a departure\r\nmade from the usual order of things? In matters of peculiar importance,\r\nwhen it happened that persons in proximity to the throne were to be\r\njudged, it was not unfrequent in western Europe that special, so-called\r\nsupreme tribunals were named. But this custom always gave reason to\r\nsuppose that the members of those supreme tribunals were only chosen\r\nfrom amongst those who would be ready to fulfil the will of him who had\r\nnamed them.\r\n\r\nThe committee appointed to judge the czarevitch consisted of 127 members\r\nof the clergy and laity; in the instructions given by the czar to the\r\nfirst it was enjoined that they should act “without any hypocrisy or\r\npartiality”; in the instructions given to the laity the following was\r\nsignified: “I ask you in order that this matter may be truthfully\r\naccomplished, without seeking to flatter me; without any respect for\r\npersons, to act righteously, and not to destroy your souls and mine, so\r\nthat our consciences may be pure at the terrible day of judgment, and\r\nour country secure.” Such were the words that the czar addressed to the\r\ntribunal; they were fine in themselves, but their signification could not\r\nhave been great, because the judges were not independent. The conceptions\r\nof the present time require that judges should not be afraid of being\r\ndismissed from their functions, of being deprived of the salaries\r\naccompanying these functions, and so on--then only can a judge be\r\nentirely impartial; but were the judges of the czarevitch and in general\r\nall the judges of that time in such a position? They were all persons in\r\nthe government service and entirely dependent on their chiefs; in the\r\npresent case whom was it they risked displeasing? The czar himself! It\r\nwas natural that they should try and read the czar’s will in the eyes of\r\nMenshikov, Tolstoi, and others of his intimates.\r\n\r\nOn the 24th of June, 1718, the sentence of the supreme tribunal was\r\npronounced. The clergy refused to pronounce sentence, but the laity\r\nunanimously decreed the penalty of death against the czarevitch.\r\nExecution, however, did not follow, but something far more terrible than\r\na public death on the scaffold did--the czarevitch was tortured on the\r\nrack. In fact, during the last days of the sitting of the tribunal, he\r\nhad been several times subjected to it and, he was even tortured after\r\nsentence had been passed upon him! All this was more than the feeble\r\norganism of the czarevitch could bear, and on the 26th of June he died\r\nin a cell of the Petersburg fortress. Amongst the number of his friends\r\nand sharers in his flight many were executed, others banished to distant\r\nplaces, to monasteries and fortresses; amongst the latter was also the\r\nczarevna Marie Alexievna, who was sent to Schlüsselburg.\r\n\r\nSuch is one of the darkest episodes of the reign of Peter. The czarevitch\r\nAlexis could not have continued the work commenced by his father; he\r\ncould not have succeeded him; he might have been judged, even condemned,\r\nif the tribunal (but an impartial tribunal) had found him guilty, and\r\nhis head might have fallen at the hands of the public executioner like\r\nthat of a criminal. But he was promised pardon if he would return, and\r\nhaving returned he was delivered up to the tribunal, he was judged by\r\npersons in whose impartiality it is impossible to believe; finally he\r\nwas tortured after sentence was pronounced, when everywhere, even to the\r\nmost insignificant of men and the greatest of criminals, time is given\r\nto prepare for death. For these things history cannot forgive the czar.\r\nUpon contemporaries the judgment and death of the czarevitch produced\r\na deep impression. There were persons who admired the czar’s decision\r\nto sacrifice his son to the welfare of the country and his great plans;\r\nthey compared him to Brutus. But there were but few such persons and they\r\nfor the greater part were foreigners and not Russians. The greatness of\r\nBrutus and civic virtues in general did not powerfully move the hearts of\r\nour forefathers; but each of them felt that it was unnatural for a father\r\nto take away his son’s life!\r\n\r\nTerrible rumours as to the details of the czarevitch’s death began to\r\nbe current amongst the people; some said that he had been secretly\r\npoisoned, others that he had been strangled, and yet others that the\r\nczar himself had cut off his head in the cell. All these were fables,\r\nbut fables which, however, may even now be met with in the works of many\r\nforeign authors and which also prove how powerfully the imagination of\r\ncontemporaries was affected by this event and how much it was talked\r\nof. That noble quality of human nature--sympathy with sufferings even\r\nwhen they are deserved--made the czarevitch dearer still to his numerous\r\npartisans. The idea that Peter had indeed been “changed” became stronger.\r\nThe common people, the merchants, the clergy, even distinguished persons,\r\nwhen they were not afraid of being overheard, said: “Would such a thing\r\nhave been possible if he were the rightful czar--would he have killed his\r\nson and made the czarevna take the veil?” In some more fanatical minds\r\nthe idea became confirmed that the czarevitch was alive and the name of\r\nthe unfortunate young man became, as did in previous times the name of\r\nthe czarevitch Dmitri, an ensign for impostors and pretenders.[h]\r\n\r\n\r\nDOMESTIC AFFAIRS\r\n\r\nThe appalling episode we have just related was so far from engrossing\r\nthe thoughts of the czar that it hardly interrupted the course of his\r\nordinary occupations. Nay, as if to darken still more the tragic horrors\r\nof the year 1718, by mingling with them the coarsest and most disgusting\r\nbuffoonery, it was in that very year he instituted the crapulous\r\nburlesque of the Conclave. The occasion of it was this: During the czar’s\r\nvisit to Paris, the doctors of the Sorbonne addressed him with the view\r\nof effecting a union between the Russo-Greek church and that of Rome, and\r\nthey presented to him a memorial full of learned arguments against the\r\nschismatical tenets of his co-religionists. This memorial only gave great\r\noffence to the court of Rome, without pleasing either the emperor or the\r\nchurch of Russia.\r\n\r\n“In this plan of reunion,” says Voltaire, “there were some political\r\nmatters which they did not understand, and some points of controversy\r\nwhich they said they understood and which each party explained according\r\nto its humour. There was a question about the Holy Ghost, who, according\r\nto the Latins, proceeds from the Father and the Son; and according to\r\nthe Greeks, at present, proceeds from the Father, through the Son, after\r\nhaving, for a long time, proceeded from the Father only. They quoted\r\nSt. Epiphanius, who says that ‘the Holy Ghost is not the Son’s brother,\r\nnor the Father’s grandson.’ But the czar, at leaving Paris, had other\r\nbusiness than to explain passages from St. Epiphanius; however, he\r\nreceived the Sorbonne’s memorial with great affability. They also wrote\r\nto some Russian bishops, who returned a polite answer; but the greater\r\nnumber received the overture with indignation.” It was to dissipate the\r\napprehensions of this reunion that, after expelling the Jesuits from his\r\ndominions, he instituted the mock conclave, as he had previously set on\r\nfoot other burlesque exhibitions, for the purpose of turning the office\r\nof patriarch into ridicule.\r\n\r\nThere was at his court an old man named Sotov, an enormous drunkard,\r\nand a court-fool of long standing; he had taught the czar to write, and\r\nby this service imagined that he deserved the highest dignities. Peter\r\npromised to confer on him one of the most eminent in the known world: he\r\ncreated him _kniaz papa_, that is to say, prince-pope, with a salary of\r\n2,000 roubles, and a palace at St. Petersburg, in the Tatar ward. Sotov\r\nwas enthroned by buffoons; four fellows, who stammered, were appointed\r\nto harangue him on his exaltation; his mock holiness created a number of\r\ncardinals, and rode in procession at the head of them, sitting astride\r\non a cask of brandy, which was laid on a sledge drawn by four oxen. They\r\nwere followed by other sledges loaded with food and drink; and the march\r\nwas accompanied by the rough music of drums, trumpets, horns, hautboys,\r\nand fiddles, all playing out of tune; and the clattering of pots and\r\npans, brandished by a troop of cooks and scullions. The train was swelled\r\nby a number of men dressed as monks of various Romish orders, and each\r\ncarrying a bottle and glass. The czar and his courtiers brought up the\r\nrear, the former in the garb of a Dutch skipper, the latter in various\r\ncomic disguises.\r\n\r\nWhen the procession arrived at the place where the conclave was to be\r\nheld the cardinals were led into a long gallery, part of which had been\r\nboarded off into a range of closets in each of which a cardinal was\r\nshut up with plenty of food and intoxicating liquors. To every one of\r\ntheir eminences were attached two conclavists--cunning young fellows,\r\nwhose business it was to ply their principals well with drink, carry\r\nreal or pretended messages to and fro between the members of the sacred\r\ncollege, and provoke them to bawl out all sorts of abuse of each other\r\nand of their respective families. The czar listened eagerly to all\r\nthis ribaldry, not forgetting in the midst of his glee to note down on\r\nhis tablets any hints of which it might be possible for him to make a\r\nvindictive use. The cardinals were not released from confinement until\r\nthey were all agreed upon a number of farcical questions submitted to\r\nthem by the _kniaz papa_.\r\n\r\nThe orgie lasted three days and three nights. The doors of the conclave\r\nwere at last thrown open in the middle of the day, and the pope and his\r\ncardinals were carried home dead drunk on sledges--that is to say, such\r\nof them as survived; for some had actually died during the debauch, and\r\nothers never recovered from its effects. This stupid farce was repeated\r\nthree times; and on the last occasion especially it was accompanied with\r\nother abominations, which admit of no description. Peter himself had his\r\ndeath accelerated by his excesses in the last conclave.\r\n\r\nFrom 1714 to 1717 Peter published ninety-two ordinances or regulations;\r\nin 1718 alone, in that year of crime, thirty-six ukases, or regulations,\r\nwere promulgated, and twenty-seven in 1719. The majority of them related\r\ndirectly to his new establishments. The council of mines dates in its\r\norigin from that period, as do also the uniformity of weights and\r\nmeasures, the institution of schools for teaching arithmetic in all the\r\ntowns of the empire; that of orphan-houses and foundling-hospitals,\r\nof workshops for the poor, and of manufactories of tapestry, silks,\r\nlinens, and cloths for soldiers’ clothing; the founding of the city of\r\nLadoga; the canal of the same name, which he began with his own hands;\r\nthat of Kronstadt; the plan of another, which now unites the Baltic to\r\nthe Caspian by the intermedium of the Volga; besides numerous measures\r\nof detail, including the police, the health of towns, lighting and\r\ncleansing, founded upon what he had remarked during the previous year in\r\nthe great cities of Europe.\r\n\r\nAt this sanguinary epoch it was that, by this multitude of establishments\r\nfor the promotion of all kinds of industry, he gave the most rapid\r\nimpulse to the knowledge, commerce, and civilisation to which he\r\nsacrificed his son; as though, by thus redoubling his activity, he had\r\nsought to escape from himself, or to palliate, by the importance of the\r\nresult, the horror of the sacrifice. In several of these ordinances it\r\nis remarkable that, either from the inconsistency which is inherent in\r\nour nature or from the pride of a despot, which believes itself to be\r\ndetached from and above everything, he required respect to be paid to\r\nreligion, at the very moment when, with such cruelty, he was paying\r\nno respect to the sanctity of his own oath; and yet the importance\r\nof keeping sworn faith must have been well known to a prince who one\r\nday said, “The irreligious cannot be tolerated because, by sapping\r\nreligion, they turn into ridicule the sacredness of an oath, which is the\r\nfoundation of all society.”\r\n\r\nIt is true that, on this occasion, pushing right into wrong, as he too\r\noften did, he mutilated and banished to Siberia a miserable creature\r\nwho, when drunk, had been guilty of blasphemy. So intolerant was he\r\nagainst intolerance. The raskolniks were, and still are, the blind and\r\nuncompromising enemies of all innovation. One of them, at that period,\r\neven believed that he might avenge heaven by an assassination. Under the\r\nguise of a suppliant, this fanatic had easily penetrated into the chamber\r\nof the prince; he was already within reach of him, and, while he feigned\r\nto implore him, his hand was seeking for the dagger under his clothes,\r\nwhen, fortunately, it dropped and betrayed the assassin, by falling at\r\nthe feet of the czar.\r\n\r\nThis abortive crime had made the persecution rage with redoubled fury\r\nwhen, all at once, a frightful report was spread; it was soon confirmed\r\nthat several hundred of these wretched beings had taken refuge in a\r\nchurch, and, rather than abjure their superstitions, had set fire to\r\ntheir asylum, leaving nothing but their ashes to their persecutor. A\r\nhorrible sacrifice, which, however, was not useless. Peter saw his error;\r\nhis intolerance was only political--it was enlightened by these flames,\r\nwhich religious intolerance witnessed with such atrocious joy.\r\n\r\nYet, unable to forgive these sectaries an obstinacy which was victorious\r\nover his own, he once more tried against them the weapon of ridicule.\r\nHe ordered that they should wear a bit of yellow stuff on their backs,\r\nto distinguish them from his other subjects. This mark of humiliation,\r\nhowever, they considered as a distinction. Some malignant advisers\r\nendeavoured to rouse his anger again, but he replied, “No; I have learned\r\nthat they are men of pure morals; they are the most upright merchants\r\nin the empire; and neither honour nor the welfare of the country will\r\nallow of their being martyred for their errors. Besides, that which a\r\ndegrading badge and force of reason have been unable to effect will never\r\nbe accomplished by punishment; let them, therefore, live in peace.”\r\n\r\nThese were remarkable words, and worthy the pupil of Holland and England,\r\nworthy of a prince to whom superstition was a most inveterate enemy. In\r\nreality, he was a believer, but not credulous; and even while he knelt\r\non the field of victory, he gave thanks to God alone for the reward of\r\nso many toils, and could separate the cause of heaven from that of the\r\npriests; it was his wish that they should be citizens. We have seen that\r\nhe subjected them to the same taxes as his other subjects; and because\r\nthe monks eluded them he diminished their numbers. He unmasked the\r\nsuperstitious impostures of the priests, who all sought to close up every\r\ncranny by which the light might have a chance of reaching them.\r\n\r\nFor this reason, they held St. Petersburg in abhorrence. According to\r\ntheir description of it, this half-built city, by which Russia already\r\naspired to civilisation, was one of the mouths of hell. It was they\r\nwho obtained from the unfortunate Alexis a promise that it should be\r\ndestroyed. Their prophecies repeatedly fixed the epoch at which it would\r\nbe overthrown by the wrath of heaven. The labours upon it were then\r\nsuspended, for so great was the fear thus inspired that the orders of the\r\nterrible czar were issued almost in vain.\r\n\r\nOn one occasion, these lying priests were for some days particularly\r\nactive; they displayed one of their sacred images, from which the tears\r\nflowed miraculously; it wept the fate which impended over those who dwelt\r\nin this new city. “Its hour is at hand,” said they, “and it will be\r\nswallowed up, with all its inhabitants, by a tremendous inundation.” On\r\nhearing of this miracle of the tears, the treacherous construction which\r\nwas put upon it, and the perturbation which it occasioned, Peter thought\r\nit necessary to hasten to the spot. There, in the midst of the people,\r\nwho were petrified with terror, and of his tongue-tied court, he seized\r\nthe miraculous image, and discovered its mechanism; the multitude were\r\nstupefied with a pious horror, but he opened their eyes by showing them,\r\nin those of the idol, the congealed oil, which was melted by the flame\r\nof tapers inside, and then flowed drop by drop through openings artfully\r\nprovided for the purpose.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [1719 A.D.]]\r\n\r\nAt a later period he did still more; the horrible execution of a young\r\nRussian by the priests was the cause. This unfortunate man had brought\r\nback from Germany a highly valuable knowledge of medicine, and had left\r\nthere some superstitious prejudices. For this reason all his motions were\r\nwatched by the priests; and they at last caught up some thoughtless words\r\nagainst their sacred images. They immediately arrested the regenerated\r\nyoung Russian, sentenced him without mercy, and put him to a torturing\r\ndeath. But this individual evil produced a general good. Indignant at\r\ntheir cruelty, Peter deprived the clergy of the right of condemning\r\nto death. The priests lost a jurisdiction which they alleged they had\r\npossessed for seven centuries, from the time of Vladimir the Great, and\r\nthus the source of their power was forever annihilated by this execrable\r\nabuse of it.\r\n\r\nIt was particularly in that sanguinary year, so fatal to the last hope\r\nwhich the old Russians placed in his successor, that Peter seemed in\r\nhaste to sever them from their ancient customs, by giving an entirely\r\nnew form to the administration of his empire. As far back as 1711, he\r\nhad already replaced the old supreme court of the boyars by a senate, a\r\nsovereign council, into which merit and services might obtain admission,\r\nindependent of noble origin. Subsequently, and every year, other changes\r\nhad been effected. Thus, in 1717, he brought from France, along with a\r\ncommercial treaty, the institution of a general police. But, in 1718,\r\ninstead of the old prikaz, he substituted, at one stroke, colleges for\r\nforeign affairs, naval affairs, finance, justice, and commerce, and\r\nfixed, by a general regulation, and with the utmost minuteness, the\r\nfunctions and privileges of each of them.\r\n\r\nAt the same time, when capable Russians were not to be found, he\r\nappointed his Swedish prisoners, and the most eminent of the foreigners,\r\nto fill these administrative and judicial situations. He was careful to\r\ngive the highest offices to natives, and the second to foreigners, that\r\nthe native officers might support, against the pride and jealousy of\r\ntheir countrymen, these foreigners who served them as instructors and\r\nguides. For the purpose of forming his young nobles for the service of\r\nthe state, he adjoined a considerable number of them to each college; and\r\nthere merit alone could raise them from the lowest stations to the first\r\nrank.\r\n\r\n\r\nRENEWED HOSTILITIES WITH SWEDEN (1719-1721 A.D.)\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [1719-1720 A.D.]]\r\n\r\nThe death of Charles XII was immediately followed by a revolution in\r\nSweden. His sister Ulrica Eleonora, who was married to the crown prince\r\nof Hesse-Cassel, succeeded him on the throne; but the constitution was\r\nchanged, the despotic authority of the crown was reduced to a mere\r\nshadow, and the queen and her husband became the tools of an oligarchy\r\nwho usurped all the powers of the state. The czar and the new queen\r\nmutually protested their desire for peace; but Peter at the same time\r\nannounced to the Swedish plenipotentiaries that, if the propositions\r\nhe had made were not accepted within two months, he would march forty\r\nthousand men into Sweden to expedite the negotiations.\r\n\r\nA project for the pacification of the north, the very opposite from that\r\nconceived by Görtz, was formed by the diet of Brunswick. The concocters\r\nof this scheme started from the principle that the German possessions of\r\nSweden were more onerous than profitable to that power, as the occasions\r\nof interminable wars. It was resolved, therefore, that they should be\r\nabandoned to the powers that had conquered them; but as it was reasonable\r\nthat the new possessors should purchase the ratification of their titles\r\nby some services to the common cause, they were required to aid Sweden\r\nin recovering possession of Finland and of Livonia, the granary of that\r\nkingdom. Of all the czar’s conquests nothing was to be left to him but\r\nSt. Petersburg, Kronstadt, and Narva; and, if he refused to assent to\r\nthis arrangement, all the contracting powers were to unite their forces\r\nand compel him to submit. This was one of those brilliant and chimerical\r\nschemes with which diplomatists sometimes allow their minds to be so\r\ndazzled as not to be convinced of their impracticability until after a\r\nlavish waste of blood.\r\n\r\nWhilst the allies were in imagination depriving Peter of his conquests,\r\nSiniavin, his admiral, took from the Swedes two ships of the line and\r\na brigantine, which were carrying corn to Stockholm. The queen of\r\nSweden, however, encouraged by the promises made her by Lord Carteret,\r\nthe ambassador of George I, intimated to the czar that she would break\r\noff the conferences at Åland if he did not consent to restore all the\r\nprovinces he had conquered. By way of reply, Peter went in June, 1719,\r\nwith a fleet of 30 ships, 150 galleys, and 300 barges, carrying in all\r\n40,000 men, to Åland, took up his station for a while under the cliffs\r\nof the island of Lämeland, and sent Apraxin to ravage the wastes on\r\nthe right of Stockholm, whilst Lessy destroyed everything on the left\r\nof the city. North and south Telge, Nyköping, Norköping, Osthammer,\r\nand Oregrund, together with two small towns, were burned, besides 150\r\nnoble mansions, 43 mills, 1,360 villages, 21 copper, iron, and tile\r\nworks--among the iron works one was worth 300,000 dollars; 100,000 cattle\r\nwere slaughtered, and 80,000 bars of iron thrown into the sea. The\r\nmines were blown up and the woods set on fire, and Stockholm itself was\r\nseriously threatened. Meanwhile, the English fleet under Admiral Norris\r\nagain entered the Baltic. Peter sent a message to the English admiral\r\nasking peremptorily whether he came only as a friend to Sweden or as an\r\nenemy to Russia. The admiral’s answer was that as yet he had no positive\r\norders. This equivocal reply did not hinder Peter from keeping the sea,\r\nand incessantly harassing the Swedes before the eyes of their naval\r\nallies.\r\n\r\nThe Swedish oligarchs and their mock king[43] had reckoned in vain upon\r\nthe intercession of the English ambassador, and the aid of the admiral\r\nand his fleet. Carteret was not even listened to by Peter, and Admiral\r\nNorris did not venture to attack the Russians, because he knew that the\r\nEnglish nation was dissatisfied with the politics of their king and of\r\nhis ministers, who favoured his Hanoverian plans. The Swedes were at\r\nlength obliged to acquiesce in the Russian demands; negotiations for\r\npeace were again commenced in Nystad at the end of the year 1720, but\r\ntheir conclusion was only brought about at the close of the following\r\nyear by the exercise of some further cruelties on the part of the\r\nRussians. The Swedes had demanded a cessation of hostilities during the\r\nwhole time in which the negotiations were pending, but Peter only granted\r\nit till May, 1721, in order to compel the council of state to come to\r\na resolution by that time; and as they still procrastinated, the whole\r\ncoast of Sweden was again plundered and devastated in the month of June.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [1721 A.D.]]\r\n\r\nThe Russian incendiaries landed in sight of the English, whose fleet\r\nunder Admiral Norris, still continued in the Baltic, but did not venture\r\nto lend any assistance to the Swedes. The whole coast, from Gefle as\r\nfar as Umeå, was ravaged; four small towns, nineteen villages, eighty\r\nnobles’ and five hundred peasants’ houses burned; twelve iron-works and\r\neight saw-mills destroyed; six galleys and other ships carried away.\r\nPeter’s plenipotentiaries at last prevailed--for he so jocularly called\r\nhis soldiers and sailors who were committing such horrible destruction\r\nin Sweden. Negotiations were again opened in Nystad, a small town in\r\nFinland, and the war of twenty-one years was closed by a peace dictated\r\nby the conquering czar.\r\n\r\nThe provinces ceded to Russia by the Peace of Nystad (September 10th,\r\n1721) were Livonia, Esthonia, and Karelia, together with Viborg, Kexholm,\r\nand the island of Ösel; on the other hand, Peter restored Finland, with\r\nthe exception of Viborg and Kexholm, and promised to pay two millions of\r\ndollars, but in the first years of the peace scarcely paid off half a\r\nmillion.\r\n\r\nFrom this time forward, the despotic sway and military oppression of\r\nRussia became the dread of all neighbouring countries and people. All\r\ncontributed to the external greatness and splendour of the ruler of a\r\nbarbarous but powerful race of slaves, whom he constrained to adopt the\r\nvestments of civilisation. The czar commanded in Poland and Scandinavia,\r\nwhere weak or wicked governments were constantly in dread from the\r\ndiscontent of the people. He also gained an influence in Germany, which\r\nultimately caused no small anxiety to the emperor and the empire. The\r\nRussian minister Bestuzhev played the chief part in Sweden in all\r\npolitical affairs, sometimes by counsel and sometimes by threats,\r\nsometimes by mediation and sometimes by commands. Bestuzhev was powerful\r\nin the Swedish council, and at the same time, in compliance with the\r\nwishes of his master, allured artists, artisans, workmen, and all those\r\nwho had been deprived of occupation or ruined by the late inroads of\r\nthe Russians, to remove with their tools, manufactures, and trades to\r\nRussia. Peter employed these people in all parts of his empire to raise\r\nup manufactories, to originate trades, and to set mines and iron-works in\r\naction.\r\n\r\nThe Russian minister spoke in a no less commanding tone in Copenhagen\r\nthan in Sweden, for Denmark was also frightened by Peter’s threats to\r\nadopt and second the cause of the duke of Holstein. The duke was detained\r\nin Russia by repeated promises, of whose fulfilment there was little\r\nprospect. The Poles, through Russian mediation, were at length reconciled\r\nto their king, and the Russians not only kept firm possession of\r\nCourland, but remained in Poland itself, under the pretence of preserving\r\nthe peace of the country. Peter, nevertheless, in his negotiations with\r\nGörtz and Charles XII, had showed himself well inclined to sacrifice King\r\nAugustus to his plans; but this scheme was frustrated by the death of\r\nCharles.\r\n\r\n\r\nPETER AS ADMINISTRATOR\r\n\r\nPeter had now achieved a prodigious amount of external and internal\r\npower; yet the original nucleus of it all was nothing more than fifty\r\nyoung companions in debauchery, whom he transformed into soldiers,\r\nand the remains of a sailing-boat, which had been left forgotten in\r\na magazine. In twenty-five years this seed, nursed by a skilful and\r\nvigorous hand, had, on the one part, produced two hundred thousand men,\r\ndivided into fifty-five regiments, and cantoned, with three hundred field\r\npieces, in permanent quarters; a body of engineers, and, particularly,\r\nof formidable artillerymen; and fourteen thousand pieces of cannon,\r\ndeposited in a great central establishment, in the fortresses, and three\r\nmilitary magazines on the frontiers of the three chief national enemies,\r\nthe Turks, the Poles, and the Swedes. On the other hand, from the relics\r\nof the sailing boat had arisen thirty ships of the line, a proportionate\r\nnumber of frigates and smaller vessels of war, two hundred galleys with\r\nsails and oars, and a multitude of experienced mariners.\r\n\r\nBut with what treasures did Peter undertake the moral and physical\r\ntransformation of such an extensive empire? We behold an entire land\r\nmetamorphosed, cities containing a hundred thousand souls, ports,\r\ncanals, and establishments of all kinds, created; thousands of skilful\r\nEuropeans attracted, maintained and rewarded; several fleets built, and\r\nothers purchased; a permanent army of a hundred and twenty thousand men,\r\ntrained, equipped, provided with every species of arms and ammunition,\r\nand several times renewed; subsidies of men and money given to Poland;\r\nand four wars undertaken. One of these wars spread over half of Europe\r\nand when it lasted twenty-one years the treasury from which it was fed\r\nstill remained full. And Peter, whose revenues on his accession did not\r\nexceed a few hundred thousand pounds, declared to Munich that he could\r\nhave carried on the war for twenty-one years longer without contracting\r\nany debt.\r\n\r\nWill order and economy be sufficient to account for these phenomena?\r\nWe must, doubtless, admire them in the czar, who refused himself every\r\nsuperfluity at the same time that he spared nothing for the improvement\r\nof his empire. Much must have been gained when, after having wrested the\r\nindirect taxes from the boyars, who were at once civil, military, and\r\nfinancial managers, and from those to whom the boyars sold in portions\r\nthe collecting of them, Peter, in imitation of Holland, entrusted the\r\nfinances to committees composed of select merchants. We may also feel\r\nless surprised at the increase of his revenue, after we have seen him\r\nsubjecting to taxation the clergy as well as the laity; suppressing a\r\nnumber of monasteries, by forbidding monastic vows to be taken before\r\nthe age of fifty; and uniting their estates to the domains of the crown,\r\nwhich were swelled by confiscations, by the reversion of his brother\r\nIvan’s appanage, and by his conquests from the Swedes.\r\n\r\nWe must remark, at the same time, that he had opened his states to\r\nforeign commerce and to the treasures of Europe, which were carried\r\nthither to be exchanged for the many raw materials which had hitherto\r\nremained valueless; we must consider the augmentation of revenue which\r\nnecessarily ensued, and the possibility of requiring to be paid in money\r\na multitude of taxes which had previously been paid in kind. Thus, in\r\nplace of quotas of provisions, which were brought from great distances\r\nand were highly oppressive to the people, he substituted a tax; and the\r\nsum raised was applied to the payment of contractors. It is true that\r\neven under this new system the state was shamefully robbed; for the\r\nnobles contrived in secret to get the contracts into their own hands,\r\nin order to fatten upon the blood of the people; but Peter at length\r\nperceived them; the evil betrayed itself by its own enormity. The czar\r\nthen created commissions of inquiry, passed whole days in them, and,\r\nduring several years, keeping these great peculators always in sight,\r\nmade them disgorge by fines and confiscations, and punished them by the\r\nknout, the halter, and the axe.\r\n\r\nTo this superintendence by the head of the state, which, subsequently to\r\n1715, the contraction of the war within a narrower circle allowed him\r\nto exert, let us add the increase of salary to the collectors, which\r\ndeprived them of all pretext for misconduct. Nor must it be forgotten\r\nthat most of the stipends were paid in kind; and that, for several years,\r\nthe war, being carried on out of the empire, supplied its own wants. It\r\nmust be observed, too, that the cities and provinces in which the troops\r\nwere afterwards quartered furnished their pay on the spot, by which the\r\ncharge of discount was saved; and that the measures which they adopted\r\nfor their subsistence appear to have been municipal, and consequently\r\nas little oppressive as possible. Finally, we must remark, in 1721, the\r\nsubstitution, in place of the Tatar house-tax, of a poll-tax, which was\r\na real impost on land, assessed according to a census repeated every\r\ntwenty years, the payment of which the agriculturists regulated among\r\nthemselves, in proportion to the value of their produce.\r\n\r\nAt the same time, the reformer refused to foreigners the privilege\r\nof trading with each other in Russia; he even gave to his subjects\r\nexclusively the right of conveying to the frontiers of the empire the\r\nmerchandise which foreigners had bought from them in the interior. Thus\r\nhe ensured to his own people the profit of carriage. In 1716 he chose\r\nrather to give up an advantageous alliance with the English than to\r\nrelinquish this right in their favour.\r\n\r\nBut all the causes we have enumerated will not yet account for the\r\npossibility of so many gigantic undertakings and such immense results,\r\nwith a fixed revenue in specie which, in 1715, was estimated by an\r\nattentive observer at only some millions of roubles. But in the fiscal\r\nexpedients of a despotic empire it is to fluctuating revenue, illegal\r\nresources, and arbitrary measures that we must direct our attention;\r\nastonishment then ceases, and then begins pity for one party, indignation\r\nagainst another, and surprise excited by the ignorance with respect to\r\ncommercial affairs which is displayed by the high and mighty geniuses of\r\ndespotism, in comparison with the unerring instinct which is manifested\r\nby the humblest community of men who are free.\r\n\r\nIt is the genius of Russian despotism, therefore, that we must question\r\nas to the means by which it produced such gigantic results; but however\r\nfar it may be disposed to push its frightful candour, will it point out\r\nto us its army recruited by men whom the villages sent tied together in\r\npairs, and at their own expense--soldiers at a penny a day, payable every\r\nfour months, and often marching without pay; slaves whom it was thought\r\nquite enough to feed, and who were contented with some handfuls of rye\r\nor of oats made into gruel or into ill-baked bread; unfortunate wretches\r\nwho, in spite of the blunders of their generals, were compelled to be\r\nvictorious, under pain of being decimated! Or will this despotism confess\r\nthat, while it gave nothing to these serfs, who were enlisted for life,\r\nit required everything from them; that, after twenty-one years of war, it\r\ncompelled them to dig canals, like miserable bond-slaves? “For they ought\r\nto serve their country,” said Peter, “either by defending or enriching\r\nit; that is what they are made for.”\r\n\r\nCould this autocrat pride himself on the perennial fulness of an\r\nexchequer which violated its engagements in such a manner that most of\r\nthe foreigners who were in his service were anxious to quit it? What\r\nanswer could he make to that hollow and lengthened groan which, even\r\nyet, seems to rise from every house in Taganrog, and in St. Petersburg,\r\nand from his forts, built by the most deadly kind of statute-labour, and\r\npeopled by requisitions? One half of the inhabitants of the villages were\r\nsent to construct them, and were relieved by the other half every six\r\nmonths; and the weakest and the most industrious of them never more saw\r\ntheir homes!\r\n\r\nThese unfortunate beings, whatever might be their calling, from the\r\ncommon delver to the watchmaker and jeweller, were torn without\r\nmercy from their families, their ploughs, their workshops, and their\r\ncounting-houses. They travelled to their protracted torture at their own\r\nexpense; they worked without any pay. Some were compelled to fill up\r\nswamps, and build houses on them; others, to remove thither suddenly,\r\nand establish their trade there; and all these hapless men, one part of\r\nwhom were bent to the earth with toil, and the other part in a manner\r\nlost in a new world, were so badly fed and sheltered, or breathed such a\r\npestilential air, that the Russians of that period used to say that St.\r\nPetersburg was built upon a bed of human skeletons.\r\n\r\nListen to the complaints of the nobles and the richest merchants: after\r\nthe gift of a hundred vessels had been required from them, they were\r\nforced to unite in this slough to build stone houses, and were also\r\nconstrained to live there at a much greater expense than they would\r\nhave incurred in their own homes. And when even the clergy remonstrated\r\nagainst the excessive taxes laid upon the priests (who were able to\r\nindemnify themselves out of their flocks) who can be astonished at the\r\npossibility of so many creations, and at the plenitude of a treasury\r\nwhich opened so widely to receive and so scantily to disburse?\r\n\r\nPersonal services, taxes in kind, taxes in money--these were the three\r\nmain sources of the power of the czar. We have just seen what estimate\r\nwe ought to form as to the manner in which the first of these was\r\nemployed. As to the taxes in kind and in money, how could the insulated\r\ncries of such a multitude of taxpayers, who were scattered over so wide\r\na space, have reached the present age, if the excess of a simultaneous\r\nand universal evil had not blended them into one vast clamour, stronger\r\nthan time and space? It is from this we learn the names of the throng\r\nof taxes which were laid upon everything, and at every opportunity,\r\nfor the war, the admiralty, the recruiting-service, for the horses\r\nused in the public works, for the brick and lime-kilns required in the\r\nbuilding of St. Petersburg, for the post-office, the government offices,\r\nthe extraordinary expenses, for the contributions in kind, for the\r\nrequisitions of men and their pay and subsistence, and for the salaries\r\nof those who were in place; to which must be added innumerable other\r\nduties on mills, ponds, baths, beehives, meadows, gardens, and, in the\r\ntowns, on every square fathom of land which bore the name of black, or\r\nnon-free. And all this was aggravated by other exorbitant and grinding\r\nburdens, and by fleecing the artisans in proportion to their industry and\r\ntheir assumed wealth--the result of which was that they concealed both;\r\nthe most laborious of them buried their earnings that they might hide\r\nthem from the nobles; and the nobles intrusted their riches to foreign\r\nbanks, that they might hide them from the czar.\r\n\r\nTo this we have yet to add the secondary oppressions; collectors, whose\r\nannual pay was, for a long time, only six roubles; and who, nevertheless,\r\naccumulated fortunes in four years, for they converted to their own use\r\ntwo thirds of the sums which they extorted; executing by torture whoever\r\nwas unable to pay, they made the most horrible misuse of the unlimited\r\npowers which according to the practice of absolute governments, were\r\nnecessarily entrusted to them--despotism being unable to act otherwise\r\nthan by delegation.\r\n\r\nThese men had the right of levying taxes on all the markets of the\r\ncountry, of laying whatever duties they pleased upon commodities, and\r\nof breaking into houses, for the purpose of preventing or discovering\r\ninfractions of their orders, so that the unfortunate people, finding that\r\nthey had nought which they could call their own, and that everything,\r\neven to their industry, belonged to the czar, ceased to exert themselves\r\nfor more than a mere subsistence, and lost that spirit which only a\r\nman’s personal interest can inspire. Accordingly, the forests were\r\npeopled with men driven to desperation, and those who at first remained\r\nin the villages, finding that they were obliged to pay the taxes of the\r\nfugitives as well as their own, speedily joined their companions.\r\n\r\nWhat can bear witness more strongly to the disordered state of those\r\ntimes than the facts themselves? They show us grandees, who were\r\npossessed of the highest credit, repeatedly convicted of embezzling the\r\npublic money; others hanged or beheaded! and a vice-chancellor himself\r\ndaring, without any authority, to give places and pensions, and, in so\r\npoor a country, contriving to purloin nearly a hundred and fifty thousand\r\npounds. It was not, therefore, the czar alone whom the people accused of\r\ntheir sufferings. But such is the tenure of despotism that, in depriving\r\nthe people of their will, it takes upon itself the whole responsibility.\r\nAll, however, agree that, about 1715, they beheld their czar astounded at\r\nthe aspect of such numerous evils; they acknowledge the efforts which he\r\nhad made, and that all of them had not been fruitless.\r\n\r\nBut, at the same time, to account for the inexhaustible abundance of the\r\nautocrat’s treasury, they represent him to us as monopolising everything\r\nfor his own benefit, giving to the current coin of his empire the\r\nvalue which suited his purpose, and receiving it from foreigners at no\r\nmore than its intrinsic worth. They accuse him of having engrossed the\r\npurchase or sale of numberless native and foreign productions, either by\r\nsuddenly taxing various kinds of merchandise or by assuming the right\r\nof being the exclusive purchaser, at his own price, to sell again at an\r\nexorbitant price when he had become the sole possessor. They say also\r\nthat, forestalling everything, their czar made himself the sole merchant\r\ntrading from European Russia to China and Siberia, as well as the sole\r\nmint-master, the sole trader in tobacco, soap, talc, pitch, and tar; that\r\nhaving also declared himself the only public-house keeper in an empire\r\nwhere drunkenness held sovereign sway, this monopoly annually brought\r\nback into his coffers all the pay that had been disbursed from them.\r\n\r\nWhen, in 1716, he wished to defray the expenses of his second journey\r\nto Holland, and at the same time avoid being a loser by the rate of\r\nexchange, what was the plan which he adopted? He laid hands on all the\r\nleather intended for exportation, which he paid for at a maximum fixed by\r\nhimself, and then exported it on his own account, the proceeds being made\r\npayable in Holland, where it was purchased by foreigners.\r\n\r\nIt is thus that many of his contemporaries explain the riches of a prince\r\nwho was the principal manufacturer and merchant of a great empire--the\r\ncreator, the superintendent of its arts. In his eyes, his subjects were\r\nnothing more than workmen, whose labours he prompted, estimated, and\r\nrewarded according to his own pleasure; he reserved to himself the sale\r\nof the produce of their industry, and the immense profits which he thus\r\ngained he employed in doubling that produce.\r\n\r\nWhat a singular founder of commerce in his empire was a monarch who\r\ndrew it all within his own sphere and absorbed it in himself! We may,\r\nhowever, be allowed to believe that he sometimes became a merchant and\r\nmanufacturer, as he became a soldier and a sailor, for the sake of\r\nexample, and that the obstinate repugnance of his ignorant subjects to\r\nmany branches of industry and commerce long compelled him to retain the\r\nmonopoly of them, whether he would or not. It is curious to remark how\r\nhis despotism recoiled upon himself when he interfered with matters so\r\nimpatient of arbitrary power as trade and credit. Soloviev is an example\r\nof this. Assisted by the privileges which Peter had granted to him, that\r\nmerchant succeeded in establishing at Amsterdam the first commercial\r\nRussian factory that had ever been worthy of notice; but in 1717, when\r\nthe czar visited Holland for the second time, his greedy courtiers\r\nirritated him against their fellow countryman. Soloviev had not chosen to\r\nransom himself from the envy which his riches inspired. They therefore\r\nslandered him to their sovereign; he was arrested and sent back to\r\nRussia; his correspondents lost their advances; confidence was ruined,\r\nand the autocrat, by confiscating this source of riches, destroyed his\r\nwork with his own hand. Yet he had a glimpse of something like free-trade\r\nprinciples. He would never impose any higher penalty on smuggling than\r\nconfiscation. “Commerce,” he said, “is like a timid maiden, who is scared\r\nby rough usage, and must be won by gentle means. Smuggle who will, and\r\nwelcome. The merchant who exposes himself to the chance of having his\r\ngoods confiscated runs a greater risk than my treasury. If he cheats me\r\nnine times and I catch him the tenth, I shall be no loser by the game.”\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Church and the Aristocracy_\r\n\r\nPeter had never been at any pains to conceal his indifference or\r\ncontempt for the national church; but it was not until that culminating\r\npoint in his history at which we are now arrived that he ventured to\r\naccomplish his design of abolishing the office of patriarch. He had left\r\nit unfilled for one-and-twenty years, and he formally suppressed it\r\nafter the conclusion of the Peace of Nystad; when heaven had declared\r\nin his favour, as it seemed to the multitude, who always believe the\r\nDeity to be on the strongest side. In the following year, however, the\r\nsynod, in spite of Theophanes, its president, whom we may consider as\r\nhis minister for religious affairs, dared to desire that a patriarch\r\nmight be appointed. But bursting into a sudden passion Peter started up,\r\nstruck his breast violently with his hand and the table with his cutlass,\r\nand exclaimed, “Here, here is your patriarch!” He then hastily quitted\r\nthe room, casting, as he departed, a stern look upon the panic-struck\r\nprelates.\r\n\r\nOf the two conquests which Peter consummated about the same time--that\r\nover Sweden and that by which he annihilated the independence of the\r\nRussian clergy--it is hard to say which was the more gratifying to his\r\npride. Someone having communicated to him the substance of a paper in the\r\nEnglish _Spectator_, in which a comparison was made between himself and\r\nLouis XIV, entirely to his own advantage, he disclaimed the superiority\r\naccorded to him by the essayist, save in one particular: “Louis XIV,”\r\nsaid he, “was greater than I, except that I have been able to reduce my\r\nclergy to obedience, while he allowed his clergy to rule him.”\r\n\r\nSoon after the abolition of the patriarchate, Peter celebrated the\r\nmarriage of Buturlin, the second _kniaz papa_ of his creation, with the\r\nwidow of Sotov, his predecessor in that mock dignity. The bridegroom\r\nwas in his eighty-fifth year, and the bride nearly of the same age. The\r\nmessengers who invited the wedding guests were four stutterers; some\r\ndecrepit old men attended the bride; the running footmen were four of\r\nthe most corpulent fellows that could be found; the orchestra was placed\r\non a sledge drawn by bears, which being goaded with iron spikes made\r\nwith their horrid roarings an accompaniment suitable to the tunes played\r\non the sledge. The nuptial benediction was given in the cathedral by a\r\nblind and deaf priest with spectacles on. The procession, the marriage,\r\nthe wedding feast, the undressing of the bride and bridegroom, the\r\nceremony of putting them to bed were all in the same style of repulsive\r\nbuffoonery. Among the coarse-minded courtiers this passed for an\r\ningenious derision of the clergy.\r\n\r\nThe nobles were another order in the state whose resistance, though\r\nmore passive than that of the clergy, was equally insufferable to the\r\nczar. His hand had always been heavy against that stiff-necked race. He\r\nhad no mercy upon their indolence and superstition, no toleration for\r\ntheir pride of birth or wealth. As landed proprietors he regarded them\r\nmerely as the possessors of fiefs, who held them by the tenure of being\r\nserviceable to the state. Such was the spirit of the law of 1715 relative\r\nto inheritances, which till then had been equally divided; but from that\r\ndate the real estate was to descend to one of the males, the choice of\r\nwhom was left to the father, while only the personal property was to pass\r\nto the other children. In this respect the law was favourable to paternal\r\nauthority and aristocracy; but its real purpose was rendered obvious\r\nby other clauses. It decreed that the inheritors of personal property\r\nshould not be permitted to convert it into real estate until after seven\r\nyears of military service, ten years of civil service, or fifteen years’\r\nprofession of some kind of art or of commerce. Nay, more, if we may rely\r\non the authority of Perry, every heir of property to the amount of five\r\nhundred roubles, who had not learned the rudiments of his native language\r\nor of some ancient or foreign language, was to forfeit his inheritance.\r\n\r\nThe great nobles had ere this been shorn of their train of boyar\r\nfollowers, or noble domestics, by whom they were perpetually attended,\r\nand these were transformed into soldiers, disciplined in the European\r\nmanner. At the same time several thousand cavalry were formed out of\r\nthe sons of the priests, who were free men, but not less ignorant and\r\nsuperstitious than their fathers. Against the inertness of the nobles,\r\ntoo, Peter made war even in the sanctuary of their families. Every one\r\nof them between the ages of ten and thirty, who evaded an enlistment\r\nwhich was termed voluntary, was to have his property confiscated to the\r\nuse of the person by whom he was denounced. The sons of the nobles were\r\narbitrarily wrested from them; some were placed in military schools;\r\nothers were sent to unlearn their barbarian manners and acquire new\r\nhabits and knowledge among polished nations; many of them were obliged\r\nto keep up a correspondence with the czar on the subject of what they\r\nwere learning; on their return, he himself questioned them, and if they\r\nwere found not to have benefited by their travels, disgrace and ridicule\r\nwere their punishment. Given up to the czar’s buffoon, they became the\r\nlaughing-stocks of the court, and were compelled to perform the most\r\ndegrading offices in the palace. These were the tyrannical punishments of\r\na reformer who managed that he might succeed in doing violence to nature\r\nby beginning education at an age when it ought to be completed, and by\r\nsubjecting grown-up men to chastisements which would scarcely be bearable\r\nfor children.\r\n\r\nIt is with reason that Mannstein reproaches Peter with having expected\r\nto transform, by travels in polished countries, men who were already\r\nconfirmed in their habits, and who were steeped to the core in ignorance,\r\nsloth, and barbarism. “The greatest part of them,” he says, “acquired\r\nnothing but vices.” This it was which drew upon Peter a lesson from\r\nhis sage; for such was the appellation which he gave to Dolgoruki.\r\nThat senator having pertinaciously, and without assigning any reason,\r\nmaintained that the travels of the Russian youth would be useless, made\r\nno other reply to an impatient and passionate contradiction from the\r\ndespot than to fold the ukase in silence, run his nail forcibly along it,\r\nand then desire the autocrat to try whether, with all his power, he could\r\never obliterate the crease that was made in the paper.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [1722 A.D.]]\r\n\r\nAt last, by his ukase of January 24th, 1722, Peter annihilated the\r\nprivileges of the old Russian aristocracy, and under the specious pretext\r\nof making merit the only source of social distinction, he created a new\r\norder of nobility, divided into eight military and as many civil grades,\r\nall immediately and absolutely dependent on the czar. The only favour\r\nallowed to the old landed aristocracy was that they were not deprived of\r\nthe right of appearing at court; but none of them could obtain the rank\r\nand appointments of an officer, nor, in any company, the respect and\r\ndistinctions exclusively belonging to that rank, until they had risen\r\nto it by actual service. Such was the fundamental principle of that\r\nnotorious system called the _tchin_;[44] and plausible as it may appear\r\nupon a superficial view, it has been fruitful of nothing but hideous\r\ntyranny, corruption, chicanery, and malversation. The modern nobility\r\nof Russia is in fact but a vile bureaucracy. The only thing truly\r\ncommendable in the ukase of 1722 is that it degrades to the level of the\r\nrabble every nobleman convicted of crime and sentenced to a punishment\r\nthat ought to entail infamy. Previously, as the reader has already seen,\r\na nobleman might appear unabashed in public, and claim all the privileges\r\nof his birth, with his back still smarting from the executioner’s lash.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Commerce with the East_\r\n\r\nPeter had always encountered great difficulty in attracting to St.\r\nPetersburg the commerce of central Russia, which the merchants\r\nobstinately persisted in throwing away upon Archangel. Yet at St.\r\nPetersburg they enjoyed several privileges, and a milder climate allowed\r\nof two freights a year, while at Archangel the ice would admit of only\r\none. To this must be added the advantage of a calmer sea, a better port,\r\nlower duties, a much shorter distance, and a much larger concourse of\r\npurchasers; but no persuasion could make the Russians abandon the old\r\nroutine, until at last Peter treated them like ignorant and stubborn\r\nchildren, to whom he would do good in spite of themselves. In 1722 he\r\nexpressly prohibited the carrying of any goods to Archangel but such as\r\nbelonged to the district of that government. This ordinance at first\r\nraised a great outcry among the traders, both native and foreign, and\r\ncaused several bankruptcies; but the merchants, accustoming themselves by\r\ndegrees to come to St. Petersburg, at last found themselves gainers by\r\nthe change.\r\n\r\nThe trade with the Mongols and Chinese had been jeopardised by the\r\nextortions of Prince Gagarin, the governor of Siberia, and by acts of\r\nviolence committed by the Russians in Peking and in the capital of\r\nContaish, the prince pontiff of a sect of dissenters from Lamaism.\r\nTo check the growth of this evil, Peter sent Ismailov, a captain in\r\nthe guards, to Peking, with presents to the emperor, among which were\r\nseveral pieces of turnery, the work of his own hands. The negotiation\r\nwas successful; but the Russians soon lost the fruits of it by fresh\r\nacts of indiscretion, and were expelled from China by order of Kam-hi.\r\nThe Russian court alone retained the right of sending a caravan every\r\nthree years to Peking; but that right again was subsequently lost in\r\nconsequence of new quarrels. The court finally renounced its exclusive\r\nprivilege, and granted the subjects leave to trade freely on the Kiakhta.\r\n\r\n\r\nWAR WITH PERSIA (1722-1724 A.D.)\r\n\r\nPeter’s attention had long been directed to the Caspian Sea with a view\r\nto making it more extensively subservient to the trade of Russia with\r\nPersia and central Asia, which as yet had been carried on at Astrakhan\r\nalone, through the medium of Armenian factors. Soon after the Peace of\r\nNystad had left the czar free to carry his arms towards the East, a\r\npretext and an opportunity were afforded him for making conquests on the\r\nCaspian shores. The Persian Empire was falling to pieces under the hand\r\nof the enervated and imbecile Husain Shah. The Lesghiians, one of the\r\ntributary nations that had rebelled against him, made an inroad into the\r\nprovince of Shirvan, sacked the city of Shemakha, put the inhabitants to\r\nthe sword, including three hundred Russian traders, and plundered Russian\r\nproperty to the amount of 4,000,000 roubles. Peter demanded satisfaction;\r\nthe shah was willing to grant it, but pleaded his helpless condition, and\r\nentreated the czar to aid him in subduing his rebellious subjects.\r\n\r\nThis invitation was promptly accepted. Peter set out for Persia on the\r\n15th of May, 1722, his consort also accompanying him on this remote\r\nexpedition. He fell down the Volga as far as the city of Astrakhan, and\r\noccupied himself in examining the works for the canals that were to join\r\nthe Caspian, Baltic, and White seas, whilst he awaited the arrival of his\r\nforces and material of war. His army consisted of twenty-two thousand\r\nfoot, nine thousand dragoons, and fifteen thousand Cossacks, besides\r\nthree thousand sailors on board the several vessels, who, in making a\r\ndescent, could do the duty of soldiers. The cavalry marched by land\r\nthrough deserts, which are frequently without water; and beyond those\r\ndeserts, they were to pass the mountains of Caucasus, where three hundred\r\nmen might keep a whole army at bay; but Persia was in such anarchy that\r\nanything might be attempted.\r\n\r\nThe czar sailed above a hundred leagues southward from Astrakhan, as\r\nfar as the small fortified town of Andreeva, which was easily taken.\r\nThence the Russian army advanced by land into the province of Daghestan;\r\nand manifestoes in the Persian and Russian language were everywhere\r\ndispersed. It was necessary to avoid giving any offence to the Ottoman\r\nPorte, which besides its subjects, the Circassians and Georgians,\r\nbordering on this country, had in these parts some considerable vassals,\r\nwho had lately put themselves under its protection. Among them, one of\r\nthe principal was Mahmud D’Utmich, who styled himself sultan, and had the\r\npresumption to attack the troops of the emperor of Russia. He was totally\r\ndefeated, and the public account says “his country was made a bonfire.”\r\n\r\nIn the middle of September, Peter reached Derbent, by the Persians and\r\nTurks called _Demir-kapu_, _i.e._ Iron Gate, because it had formerly such\r\na gate towards the south; it is a long narrow town, backed against a\r\nsteep spur of the Caucasus; and its walls, at the other end, are washed\r\nby the sea, which, in stormy weather, is often known to break over them.\r\nThese walls may be justly accounted one of the wonders of antiquity;\r\nthey were forty feet high and six broad; flanked with square towers at\r\nintervals of fifty feet. The whole work seemed one single piece, being\r\nbuilt of a kind of brown free-stone, and a mortar of pounded shells, the\r\nwhole forming a mass harder than marble itself; it was accessible by sea,\r\nbut, on the land side, seemed impregnable. Near it were the ruins of\r\nan old wall, like that of China, unquestionably built in times of the\r\nearliest antiquity; it was carried from the Caspian to the Black Sea, and\r\nprobably was a rampart thrown up by the ancient kings of Persia against\r\nthe numerous barbarian hordes dwelling between those two seas. There were\r\nformerly three or four other Caspian gates at different passages, and\r\nall apparently built for the same end; the nations west, east, and north\r\nof this sea having ever been formidable barbarians; and from these parts\r\nprincipally issued those swarms of conquerors which subdued Asia and\r\nEurope.\r\n\r\nOn the approach of the Russian army, the governor of Derbent, instead\r\nof standing a siege, laid the keys of the city at the emperor’s\r\nfeet--whether it was that he thought the place not tenable against such\r\na force, or that he preferred the protection of the emperor Peter to\r\nthat of the Afghan rebel Mahmud. Thus the army quietly took possession\r\nof Derbent, and encamped along the sea-shore. The usurper Mahmud, who\r\nhad already made himself master of a great part of Persia, had neglected\r\nnothing to be beforehand with the czar and hinder him from getting into\r\nDerbent; he raised the neighbouring Tatars, and hastened thither himself;\r\nbut Derbent was already in the czar’s hands.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [1723 A.D.]]\r\n\r\nPeter was unable to extend his conquests further, for the vessels with\r\nprovisions, stores, horses, and recruits had been wrecked near Astrakhan;\r\nand as the unfavourable season had now set in he returned to Moscow and\r\nentered it in triumph (January 5th, 1723), though he had no great reason\r\nto boast of the success of his ill-planned expedition.\r\n\r\nPersia was still divided between Husain and the usurper Mahmud; the\r\nformer sought the support of the emperor of Russia; the latter feared him\r\nas an avenger who would wrest from him all the fruits of his rebellion.\r\nMahmud used every endeavour to stir up the Ottoman Porte against Peter.\r\nWith this view, he sent an embassy to Constantinople; and the Daghestan\r\nprinces, under the sultan’s protection, having been dispossessed of\r\ntheir dominions by the arms of Russia, solicited revenge. The Divan were\r\nalso under apprehensions for Georgia, which the Turks considered part of\r\ntheir dominions. The sultan was on the point of declaring war, when the\r\ncourts of Vienna and Paris diverted him from that measure. The emperor of\r\nGermany made a declaration that if the Turks attacked Russia he should be\r\nobliged to join in its defence; and the marquis de Bonac, ambassador from\r\nFrance at Constantinople, seconded the German menaces; he convinced the\r\nPorte that their own interest required them not to suffer the usurper of\r\nPersia to set an example of dethroning sovereigns, and that the Russian\r\nEmpire had done no more than the sultan should have done.\r\n\r\nDuring these critical negotiations, the rebel Mahmud had advanced to the\r\ngates of Derbent, and laid waste all the neighbouring countries, in order\r\nto distress the Russians. That part of ancient Hyrcania, now known by the\r\nname of Ghilan, was not spared, which so irritated the people that they\r\nvoluntarily put themselves under the protection of the Russians. Herein\r\nthey followed the example of the shah himself, who had sent to implore\r\nthe assistance of Peter the Great; but the ambassador was scarcely on\r\nthe road ere the rebel Mahmud seized on Ispahan, and the person of his\r\nsovereign. Thamaseb, son of the captive shah, escaped, and getting\r\ntogether some troops fought a battle with the usurper. He was not less\r\neager than his father in urging Peter the Great to protect him, and sent\r\nto the ambassador a renewal of the instructions which the shah Husain had\r\ngiven.\r\n\r\nThough this Persian ambassador, named Ismail Beg, was not yet arrived,\r\nhis negotiation had succeeded. On his landing at Astrakhan, he heard\r\nthat General Matufkin was on his march with fresh troops to reinforce\r\nthe Daghestan army. The town of Baku, from which the Persians called the\r\nCaspian Sea, the sea of Baku, was not yet taken. He gave the Russian\r\ngeneral a letter to the inhabitants, exhorting them, in his master’s\r\nname, to submit to the emperor of Russia; the ambassador continued his\r\njourney to St. Petersburg, and General Matufkin went and sat down before\r\nthe city of Baku. The Persian ambassador reached the czar’s court at the\r\nsame time as the news of the surrender of that city (August, 1723).\r\n\r\nBaku is situated near Shemakha, where the Russian factors were massacred;\r\nand although in wealth and number of people inferior to it, is very\r\nfamous for its naphtha, with which it supplies all Persia. Never was\r\ntreaty sooner concluded than that of Ismail Beg. The emperor Peter,\r\ndesirous of revenging the death of his subjects, engaged to march an army\r\ninto Persia, in order to assist Thamaseb against the usurper; and the new\r\nshah ceded to him, besides the cities of Baku and Derbent, the provinces\r\nof Ghilan, Mazandaran, and Astarabath.\r\n\r\nGhilan, as we have already noticed, is the southern Hyrcania; Mazandaran,\r\nwhich is contiguous to it, is the country of the Mardi; Astarabath\r\nborders on Mazandaran; and these were the three principal provinces of\r\nthe ancient kings of the Medes. Thus Peter by his arms and treaties came\r\nto be master of Cyrus’ first monarchy; but this proved to be but a barren\r\nconquest, and the empress Anna was glad to surrender it thirteen years\r\nafterwards in exchange for some commercial advantages.\r\n\r\nSo calamitous was the state of Persia that the unhappy sophy Thamaseb\r\nwandering about his kingdom, pursued by the rebel Mahmud, the murderer\r\nof his father and brothers, was reduced to supplicate both Russia and\r\nTurkey at the same time, that they would take one part of his dominions\r\nto preserve the other for him. At last it was agreed between the emperor\r\nPeter, the sultan Achmet III, and the sophy Thamaseb, that Russia should\r\nhold the three provinces above mentioned, and that the Porte should have\r\nKasbin, Tauris, and Erivan, besides what it should take from the usurper.\r\n\r\n\r\nLAST YEARS AND DEATH OF PETER\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [1723-1724 A.D.]]\r\n\r\nPeter, at his return from his Persian expedition, was more than ever\r\nthe arbiter of the north. He openly took into his protection the family\r\nof Charles XII, after having been eighteen years his declared enemy. He\r\ninvited to his court the duke of Holstein, that monarch’s nephew, to whom\r\nhe betrothed his eldest daughter, and from that time prepared to assert\r\nhis rights on the duchy of Schleswig-Holstein, and even bound himself to\r\nit in a treaty which he concluded with Sweden (February, 1724). He also\r\nobtained from that power the title of royal highness for his son-in-law,\r\nwhich was a recognition of his right to the throne, should King Frederick\r\ndie without issue. Meanwhile he held Copenhagen in awe of his fleet, and\r\nruled there through fear, as he did in Stockholm and Warsaw.\r\n\r\nThe state of Peter’s health now warned him that his end was near; yet\r\nstill he delayed to exercise the right of naming a successor, which he\r\nhad arrogated to himself in 1722. The only step he took which might\r\nbe interpreted as an indication of his wishes in that respect was\r\nthe act of publicly crowning his consort Catherine. The ceremony was\r\nperformed at Moscow (May 18th, 1724) in the presence of the czar’s niece,\r\nAnna, duchess of Courland, and of the duke of Holstein, his intended\r\nson-in-law. The manifesto published by Peter on this occasion deserves\r\nnotice; after stating that it was customary with Christian monarchs to\r\ncrown their consorts, and instancing among the orthodox Greek emperors\r\nBasilides, Justinian, Heraclius, and Leo the Philosopher, he goes on to\r\nsay:\r\n\r\n“It is also known how far we have exposed our own person, and faced the\r\ngreatest dangers in our country’s cause, during the whole course of the\r\nlast war, twenty-one years successively, and which, by God’s assistance,\r\nwe have terminated with such honour and advantage, that Russia never saw\r\na like peace, nor gained that glory which has accrued to it by this war.\r\nThe empress Catherine, our dearly beloved consort, was of great help to\r\nus in all these dangers, not only in the said war but likewise in other\r\nexpeditions, in which, notwithstanding the natural weakness of her sex,\r\nshe voluntarily accompanied us, and greatly assisted us with her advice,\r\nparticularly at the battle of the river Pruth against the Turks, where\r\nour army was reduced to 22,000 men, and that of the Turks consisted of\r\n270,000. It was in this desperate exigency that she especially signalised\r\na zeal and fortitude above her sex; and to this all the army and the\r\nwhole empire can bear witness. For these causes, and in virtue of the\r\npower which God hath given us, we have resolved, in acknowledgment of all\r\nher fatigues and good offices, to honour our consort with the imperial\r\ncrown, which, by God’s permission, shall be accomplished this winter at\r\nMoscow; and of this resolution we hereby give notice to all our faithful\r\nsubjects, our imperial affection towards whom is unalterable.”\r\n\r\nIn this manifesto nothing was said of the empress’ succeeding to the\r\nthrone; but the nation were in some degree prepared for that event by\r\nthe ceremony itself, which was not customary in Russia, and which was\r\nperformed with sumptuous splendour. A circumstance which might further\r\ncause Catherine to be looked upon as the presumptive successor was that\r\nthe czar himself, on the coronation day, walked before her on foot, as\r\nfirst knight of the order of St. Catherine, which he had instituted in\r\n1714 in honour of his consort. In the cathedral he placed the crown on\r\nher head with his own hand. Catherine would then have fallen on her\r\nknees, but he raised her up, and when she came out of the cathedral the\r\nglobe and sceptre were carried before her.\r\n\r\nIt was not long before Peter was with difficulty restrained from sending\r\nto the block the head on which he had but lately placed the crown. We\r\nhave already mentioned that the enmity of his first wife is said to\r\nhave sprung from her jealousy of Anne de Moens, who was for awhile\r\nthe czar’s mistress, and whom, as Villebois tells us, he had serious\r\nthoughts of raising to the throne. But she submitted to his passion only\r\nthrough fear, and Peter, disgusted with her coldness towards him, left\r\nher to follow her inclinations in marrying a less illustrious lover.\r\nFive-and-twenty years afterwards Eudoxia was avenged through the brother\r\nof her rival. Anne de Moens, then the widow of General Balk, was about\r\nthe person of Catherine, and the handsome and graceful young Moens de la\r\nCroix was her chamberlain. A closer intimacy soon arose between them,\r\nand so unguarded were they that Villebois, who saw them together only in\r\npublic during a very crowded reception at court, says that their conduct\r\nwas such as left no doubt on his mind that the empress was guilty. The\r\nczar’s suspicions were roused, and he set spies upon Catherine.\r\n\r\nThe court was then at Peterhof; Prince Repnin, president of the war\r\ndepartment, slept not far from the czar; it was two o’clock in the\r\nmorning; all at once the marshal’s door was violently thrown open,\r\nand he was startled by abrupt and hasty footsteps: he looked round in\r\nastonishment; it was Peter the Great; the monarch was standing by the\r\nbedside; his eyes sparkled with rage, and all his features were distorted\r\nwith convulsive fury. Repnin tells us that at the sight of that\r\nterrible aspect he was appalled, gave himself up for lost, and remained\r\nmotionless; but his master, with a broken and panting voice, exclaimed to\r\nhim, “Get up! speak to me! there’s no need to dress yourself”; and the\r\ntrembling marshal obeyed.\r\n\r\nHe then learned that, but the instant before, guided by too faithful a\r\nreport, the czar had suddenly entered Catherine’s apartment; that the\r\ncrime was revealed, the ingratitude proved; that at daybreak the empress\r\nshould lose her head--that the emperor was resolved!\r\n\r\nThe marshal, gradually recovering his voice, agreed that such a monstrous\r\nact of treachery was horrible; but he reminded his master of the fact\r\nthat the crime was as yet known to no one, and of the impolicy of making\r\nit public; then, growing bolder, he dared to call to recollection the\r\nmassacre of the strelitz, and that every subsequent year had been\r\nensanguined by executions; that, in fine, after the imprisonment of\r\nhis sister, the condemning of his son to death, and the scourging and\r\nimprisonment of his first wife, if he should likewise cut off the head of\r\nhis second, Europe would no longer look upon him in any other light than\r\nthat of a ferocious prince, who thirsted for the blood of his subjects\r\nand even of those who were a part of himself. Besides, he added, the czar\r\nmight have satisfaction by giving up Moens to the sword of the law upon\r\nother charges; and as to the empress, he could find means to rid himself\r\nof her without any prejudice to his glory.\r\n\r\nWhile Repnin was thus advising, the czar, who stood motionless before\r\nhim, gazed upon him intently and wildly, and kept a gloomy silence. But\r\nin a short time, as was the case when he was labouring under strong\r\nemotions, his head was twisted to the left side, and his swollen features\r\nbecame convulsively contracted--signs of the terrible struggle by which\r\nhe was tortured. And yet the excessive working of his mind held his body\r\nin a state of frightful immovability. At length, he rushed precipitately\r\nout of the chamber into the adjoining room. For two whole hours he\r\nhastily paced it; then suddenly entering again like a man who had made up\r\nhis mind, he said to Repnin, “Moens shall die immediately! I will watch\r\nthe empress so closely that her first slip shall cost her life!”\r\n\r\nMoens and his sister were at once arrested. They were both confined in\r\nthe winter palace, in an apartment to which none had admission except\r\nthe emperor himself, who carried them their food. At the same time a\r\nreport was spread that the brother and the sister had been bribed by the\r\nenemies of the country, in hopes of bringing the empress to act upon the\r\nmind of the czar prejudicially to the interests of Russia. Moens was\r\ninterrogated by the monarch in presence of General Uschakov; and after\r\nhaving confessed whatever they pleased, he lost his head on the block\r\n(November 27th). At the same time his sister, who was an accomplice in\r\nthe crime and a favourite of Catherine, received the knout, and was\r\nbanished to Siberia; her property was confiscated; her two sons were\r\ndegraded and were sent to a great distance, on the Persian frontier, as\r\nprivate soldiers.\r\n\r\nMoens walked to meet his fate with manly firmness. He always wore a\r\ndiamond bracelet, to which was a miniature of Catherine; but, as it was\r\nnot perceived at the time of his being seized, he found means to conceal\r\nit under his garter; and when he was on the scaffold he confided this\r\nsecret to the Lutheran pastor who accompanied him, and under cover of his\r\ncloak slipped the bracelet into his hand to restore it to the empress.\r\n\r\nThe czar was a spectator of the punishment of Moens from one of the\r\nwindows of the senate. The execution being over, he got upon the\r\nscaffold, took the head of Moens by the hair, and expressed with brutal\r\nenergy how delighted he was with the vengeance he had taken. The same\r\nday Peter had the cruelty to conduct Catherine in an open carriage round\r\nthe stake on which was fixed the head of her unfortunate lover. He\r\nwatched her countenance attentively, but fortunately she had self-command\r\nenough not to betray her grief. Repnin adds that, from that dreadful\r\nnight till his death, Peter never more spoke to the empress except in\r\npublic, and that, in his dwelling, he always remained separate from\r\nher.[e]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [1725 A.D.]]\r\n\r\nPeter the Great only lived to his fifty-third year. In spite of frequent\r\nattacks of illness and of his calling himself an old man, the emperor\r\nmight have hoped to live yet a long while and to be able to dispose of\r\nhis great inheritance in accordance with the interests of the state.\r\nBut his days were already numbered. When Peter came to St. Petersburg\r\nin March, 1723, on his return from Persia, he appeared in much better\r\nhealth than before the campaign; in the summer of 1724 he became very\r\nweak, but in the second half of September he grew visibly better, walked\r\nat times in his gardens, and sailed on the Neva. On the 22nd of September\r\nhe had a very severe attack; it is said that he fell into such a state of\r\nirritation that he struck the doctors and called them asses; afterwards\r\nhe again became better, and on the 29th of September he was present at\r\nthe launching of a frigate, although he told the Dutch minister Wild that\r\nhe still felt rather weak. In spite of this he set off in the beginning\r\nof October to inspect the Ladoga canal, against the advice of his doctor\r\nBlumentrost; then he went to the Olonetz iron works and hammered out with\r\nhis own hands a bar of iron of the weight of three pouds;[45] from there\r\nhe went to Starya Rusa to inspect the salt works, and in the beginning\r\nof November he went by water to St. Petersburg. But there, at a place\r\ncalled Lakta, he saw that a boat coming from Kronstadt with soldiers had\r\nrun aground; he allowed no one to restrain him, but went himself to their\r\nassistance and helped to float the boat and save the people, standing\r\nup to his waist in the water. The attacks were speedily renewed; Peter\r\narrived at St. Petersburg ill and could not regain his health; the affair\r\nof Mons also aggravated his condition. He occupied himself but little\r\nwith affairs, although he showed himself as usual in public. On the 17th\r\nof January, 1725, the malady increased; Peter ordered that a movable\r\nchurch should be constructed near his sleeping room and on the 22nd he\r\nmade his confession and received the sacrament; his strength began to\r\nleave him, he no longer cried out as before from the violence of the pain\r\nbut only groaned. On the 27th all criminals were pardoned who had been\r\ncondemned to death or to the galleys according to the articles of war,\r\nexcepting those guilty of the first two offences against the law--murder\r\nand repeated robbery; the noblemen who had not appeared at the military\r\nreviews at the appointed time were also pardoned. On that day, at the\r\nexpiration of the second hour, Peter asked for paper and tried to write,\r\nbut the pen fell out of his hand; of that which he had written only the\r\nwords “give up everything” could be deciphered; he then ordered his\r\ndaughter Anna Petrovna to be called so that she might write under his\r\ndictation, but he could not pronounce the words. The following day, the\r\n28th of January, at the beginning of the sixth hour after midnight, Peter\r\nthe Great was no more. Catherine was almost unceasingly with him, and it\r\nwas she who closed his eyes.\r\n\r\nIn terrible physical sufferings, in full recognition of the weakness of\r\nhumanity, asking for the comfort afforded by religion, died the greatest\r\nof historical workers. We have already spoken in the proper place of\r\nhow the work of Peter was prepared by all preceding history; how it\r\nnecessarily proceeded from the same; how it was required by the people,\r\nwho by means of a tremendous revolution in their existence and customs,\r\nby means of an extraordinary effort of strength, had to be brought forth\r\nfrom their hopeless condition into a new way, a new life. But this in\r\nnowise diminishes the greatness of the man who in the accomplishment of\r\nso difficult an exploit lent his mighty hand to a great nation, and by\r\nthe extraordinary power of his will strained all her forces and gave\r\ndirection to the movement.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLOVIEV’S ESTIMATE OF PETER’S WORK\r\n\r\nRevolutionary epochs constitute a critical time for the life of nations,\r\nand such was the epoch of the reformation of Peter. Complaints of the\r\ngreat burdens were to be heard from all sides--and not without cause. The\r\nRussian knew no rest from recruiting: recruiting for painful, ceaseless\r\nmilitary service in the infantry, and for the newly created naval\r\nservice; recruiting of workmen for new and difficult labour in distant\r\nand unattractive places; recruiting of scholars for the schools, and of\r\nyoung men to be sent to study abroad. For the army and for the fleet, for\r\nthe great works and undertakings, for the schools and the hospitals, for\r\nthe maintenance of diplomats and diplomatic bribery, money was necessary.\r\nBut there was no money in the impoverished state, and heavy taxes in\r\nmoney and in kind had to be levied upon all; in necessary cases they\r\nwere deducted from the salaries; well-to-do people were ruined by the\r\nconstruction of houses in St. Petersburg; everything that could be taken\r\nwas taken, or farmed out; the poor people had one object of luxury--oak\r\ncoffins; but these were confiscated by the fiscus and sold at a high\r\nprice; _raskolniki_ (dissenters) had to pay double taxes; the bearded\r\nhad to pay for the privilege of wearing their beards. Orders upon orders\r\nwere issued; men were to seek for ores and minerals, and for dye-stuffs;\r\nthey were to tend their sheep not as they had previously done, to dress\r\nthe skins differently, to build boats in a new way, to dare weave no\r\nnarrow pieces of cloth, to take their goods to the west instead of to the\r\nnorth.[46] New government centres were created, new courts established,\r\nthe people did not know where to turn, the members of these new\r\ninstitutions and courts did not know how to go about their novel duties,\r\nand official papers were sent from one place to another.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A BASHKIRIAN WOMAN]\r\n\r\nThe standing army pressed heavily on the unarmed population. People tried\r\nto escape from the hard service and hide themselves, but all were not\r\nsuccessful, and cruel punishments threatened the disobedient. Illiterate\r\nnobles were forbidden to marry. Meanwhile beneath the new French frocks\r\nand wigs there was the old coarseness of manners; the same want of\r\nrespect for human dignity in oneself and in others; the same hideous\r\ndrunkenness and noisy brawling with which every festivity was terminated.\r\nWoman was brought into the society of men, but she was not surrounded\r\nwith the respect due to her sex and obligations; pregnant women were made\r\nto drink to excess. The members of the highest institutions quarrelled\r\nand abused each other in the coarsest manner; bribery was as bad as\r\nbefore; the weak were subjected to every violence from the strong, and,\r\nas formerly, the noble was permitted to oppress the _moujik_ (peasant),\r\nthe well-born the base-born.\r\n\r\nBut this is only one side: there is another. The people were passing\r\nthrough a hard school--the stern teacher was not sparing in punishments\r\nfor the idle and those who violated the regulations; but the matter was\r\nnot limited to threats and punishments alone. The people were really\r\nlearning, learning not only figures and geometry, not only in Russian and\r\nforeign schools; the people were learning the duties of citizens, the\r\nwork of citizens. At the emission of every important regulation, at the\r\ninauguration of every great reform, the lawgiver explains why he acts\r\nthus, why the new is better than the old. The Russians then received such\r\ninstruction for the first time; what now seems to us so simple and within\r\nthe reach of all was first learned by these people from the edicts and\r\nmanifestoes of Peter the Great.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A PEASANT OF LITTLE RUSSIA]\r\n\r\nFor the first time the mind of the Russian was awakened, his attention\r\ndirected to the great questions of political and social organisation;\r\nwhether he turned sympathisingly or unsympathisingly to the words and\r\ndeeds of the czar was a matter of indifference--he was obliged to\r\nthink over these words and deeds, and they were continually there to\r\narouse him. That which might have ruined a decrepit society, a people\r\nincapable of development--the shocks of the epoch of reforms, the utter\r\nrestlessness--developed the forces of a vigorous young nation which had\r\nbeen long asleep and required a violent shock to awaken it. And there\r\nwas much to be learned. Above was the governing senate, the synod;\r\neverywhere was collegiate organisation, the advantages of which were\r\nset forth in the church statutes. Everywhere the principle of election\r\nwas introduced. The trade guilds were withdrawn from the jurisdiction\r\nof the local governors and given their own independent administration.\r\nPeter’s whole system of government was directed against the chief evils\r\nfrom which ancient Russia had suffered: the immaturity of forces, the\r\nwant of a public spirit, the lack of independence of action, the absence\r\nof initiative capacity. The former council of the czar (_douma_) had\r\nsuffered from all the deficiencies enumerated. Peter established the\r\nsenate, to which fidelity had to be sworn and the ukases of which had to\r\nbe obeyed as the ukases of the czar himself. Peter was not jealous of\r\nthe power created by him: he did not limit it; but on the contrary he\r\ncontinually and without ceremony required that it should profit by its\r\nimportance, that it should really be a governing body. Peter’s reproaches\r\nand rebukes to the senate were directed against its slowness, its\r\nlanguor, its want of management, and its inability to carry its decrees\r\ninto immediate effect. The Russian of former times who had received a\r\ncommission from the government went about in leading strings. He was not\r\ntrusted, his smallest movement was feared, he was swathed like a child in\r\nlong detailed instructions, and upon every fresh occasion that presented\r\nitself and was not defined in the instructions, the grown up child\r\nrequired teaching. This habit of asking for orders greatly angered Peter:\r\n“Act according to your own consideration, how can I tell you from such a\r\ndistance!” he wrote to those who asked him for instructions. He employed\r\nthe collegiate system--whether he had met with it in the west or whether\r\nit had been advised by Leibnitz is a matter of indifference; he employed\r\nit everywhere as the most powerful method of training the Russian people\r\nto unrestrained public activity. Instead of separate individuals,\r\ninstitutions came to the front, and over all rose the state, the real\r\nsignificance of which the people of Russia now learned for the first time\r\nwhen they had to take the oath.\r\n\r\nHaving set forth the importance of the state, and demanding that heavy\r\nsacrifices should be made, to this new divinity, himself giving the\r\nexample, he nevertheless took measures that the individual should not be\r\ncrushed, but should receive the requisite, balancing development. The\r\nfirst place must here naturally be given to the civilisation introduced\r\nby Peter, to the acquaintance with other nations in advance of Russia. We\r\nknow that before the time of Peter the bond of the family was powerfully\r\nmaintained in Russia; its prolonged existence is easily explained by the\r\ncondition of society, which was unable to safeguard its members, and\r\nwho were therefore obliged to seek security in private associations,\r\nchief among which was the natural blood relationship between members of\r\nthe same family or clan. The elder protected the younger, and had power\r\nover them because they had to answer to the government for them. It was\r\nthus in every sphere of society; the independent Russian never presented\r\nhimself alone, but always accompanied by his brothers and nephews; to be\r\nwithout clan and family was equivalent to being in the utmost poverty. It\r\nis easy to understand that the clan association hindered the development\r\nof personality; the state could not give to personal merit power over\r\nclan rights; jealous to the last degree of any insult to the honour of\r\nhis clan, the ancient Russian was indifferent to his own personal honour.\r\nBut by the end of the seventeenth century the demands of the state had so\r\nincreased that the unity of the clan could not withstand them, and the\r\ndestruction of precedence (_mestnitchestov_) struck a blow to the clan\r\nbond in the highest class of society, among those in the service of the\r\nczar. The reform of Peter struck a final blow by its decided, exclusive\r\nattention to personal merit, by raising persons “above their old parents”\r\n(that is, their kinsfolk), by bringing into the service a large number of\r\nforeigners; it became advantageous for new men to appear to have no clan\r\nrelations, and many of them began willingly to trace their origin from\r\nforeign countries.\r\n\r\nAs to the lower ranks of the population, the blow to the clan bond was\r\nbrought about by the poll-tax; the former expression, “such a one with\r\nhis brothers and nephews,” began to disappear, for the brothers and\r\nnephews had to pay separately each for himself, and appeared as separate,\r\nindependent individuals. And not only did the former clan relations\r\ndisappear, but even within the family itself, while requiring the\r\ndeepest respect from children to their parents,[47] Peter recognised\r\nthe right of the individual, and enjoined that marriages should be\r\ncelebrated by the agreement of the children, and not by the will of\r\ntheir parents; the right of the person was also recognised in the\r\nbond-servant, for the landowner had to swear that he would not compel his\r\npeasants to marry against their will. We have heard the dispassionate\r\ndeclaration of a contemporary Russian as to the corruption of persons\r\nin the service of the czars in the seventeenth and the beginning of the\r\neighteenth centuries, of their indifference to honour, so that amongst\r\nthem the shameful saying was current: “Flight may be dishonourable, but\r\nit is salutary.” Under Peter this saying was extirpated, and he himself\r\ntestified that in the second half of the Northern War flight from\r\nthe field of battle had ceased. Finally the personality of woman was\r\nrecognised in consequence of her liberation from the _terem_.[48]\r\n\r\nThus were the people of Russia trained in the stern school of reform.\r\nThe terrible labour and privations they endured were not in vain. A vast\r\nand comprehensive programme was traced out for many future years, not\r\non paper but on the earth which must open up its riches to the Russian,\r\nwho through science had acquired the full right of disposing of it; on\r\nthe sea, where the Russian fleet had now appeared; on the rivers, united\r\nby canals; it was traced out in the state by the new institutions and\r\nregulations; it was traced out in the people by the new civilisation, by\r\nthe enlarging of its mental sphere, by the rich stores of mental food\r\nfurnished by the west, now disclosed to his view, and by the new world\r\ncreated within Russia herself. The greater part of all this was only in\r\nits beginnings; the rest in rough outline--for much only the materials\r\nwere prepared, only indications made; and therefore we have called the\r\nwork of the epoch of reform a programme, which Russia is fulfilling until\r\nnow, and will continue to fulfil, and any deviation from which has always\r\nbeen accompanied by grievous consequences.\r\n\r\nClearly recognising that the Russian people must pass through a hard\r\nschool, Peter did not hesitate to subject it to the painful, humiliating\r\nposition of a pupil; but at the same time he succeeded in balancing the\r\ndisadvantages of such a position by glory and greatness: in converting\r\nit into an active one, he succeeded both in creating the political\r\nimportance of Russia and the means for its maintenance. A difficult\r\nproblem presented itself to Peter; for the education of the Russian\r\npeople it was necessary to call in foreign instructors, directors who\r\nnaturally endeavoured to subject their pupils to their influence, to\r\nset themselves above them; but this humiliated the pupils, of whom\r\nPeter wished to make masters as soon as possible. He did not give way\r\nto the temptation, did not accept proposals to carry the work to a\r\nspeedy success with the aid of learned foreigners; he desired that his\r\nown Russian subjects should pass through an active, practical school,\r\neven though it might occasion great losses and be accompanied by great\r\ndiscomforts. We have seen how he hastened to rid himself of a foreign\r\nfield-marshal, how he put Russians in all the highest positions and\r\nforeigners only in secondary ones; and we have also seen how he was\r\nrewarded for his faith in his people and his devotion to it.\r\n\r\nIt was with the same uncommon caution, with the skill required for\r\nremaining within due bounds that Peter solved the difficult problem of\r\nchurch reform. He destroyed unipersonal government and replaced it by\r\nthe collegiate or council system, which fully corresponded with the\r\nspirit of the eastern church; we have seen that one of Peter’s chief\r\ncares was to raise the Russian clergy by means of education; in spite of\r\nhis strong and comprehensible aversion to monasticism he did not abolish\r\nthis institution as did Henry VIII of England--he only tried to give it a\r\ngreater activity corresponding to its character.\r\n\r\nFrom whatever point of view we study the epoch of reforms, we must fall\r\ninto wonderment both at the mental and physical powers of Peter. Powers\r\nare developed by their exercise, and we do not know of any historical\r\nworker whose sphere of activity was so vast. Born with an unusually\r\nwide-awake intellect, Peter cultivated this quickness of perception to\r\nthe highest degree. From his youth he listened and looked to everything\r\nhimself, was not guided or restricted by anyone, but was excited and\r\naroused by the state of society, already then on the threshold of changes\r\nand hesitating between two directions, agitated by the question of the\r\nold and new, when by the side of ancient Moscow the advance guard of the\r\nwest, the German suburb, was already in view. Peter’s nature was cast in\r\nthe old Russian heroic mould, he loved breadth and scope; this explains\r\nthe fact that besides his conscious attraction for the sea he had also an\r\nunconscious attraction for it: the heroes of ancient Russia yearned for\r\nthe wide steppes--the new hero yearned after the broad ocean; places shut\r\nin by mountains were displeasing and wearisome to him. Thus he complained\r\nto his wife of the situation of Karlsbad: “This place is so merry that\r\nit might almost be called an honorable prison, for it is so squeezed in\r\nbetween mountains that the sun can hardly be seen.” In another letter he\r\ncalls Karlsbad a hole in the ground.\r\n\r\nTo the powers of a hero of ancient times corresponded passions not\r\nmoderated by any regular, skilful education. We are aware to what lengths\r\nthe unbridled passions of a vigorous man could be carried in ancient\r\nRussian society, unrestrained as it was by due bounds: how then could\r\nsuch a society put a check upon the passions of a man who stood at the\r\nvery summit of power? But an observant contemporary woman has very justly\r\ndeclared with regard to Peter that he was both a very good and a very bad\r\nman. Without denying or diminishing the dark side of Peter the Great’s\r\ncharacter, let us not forget the brighter side, which outweighed the dark\r\nand was able to attach people so strongly to him. If his wrath burst\r\nforth at times so terribly against those whom he regarded as the enemies\r\nof the country and of the general welfare, yet he attached to himself\r\nstrongly, and was strongly attached to persons of opposite tendencies.\r\n\r\nAn unusual greatness, joined to the recognition of the insignificance\r\nof mere human intellect, a stern insistence on the fulfilment of\r\nduties, a stern demand for truth, the capacity of listening to the\r\nharshest objections, an extraordinary simplicity, sociability, and kind\r\nheartedness--all these qualities powerfully attached to Peter the best of\r\nthe men who had occasion to come in contact with him; and it is therefore\r\neasy to understand the impression produced upon them by the news of the\r\ndeath of the great emperor. Nepluev writes as follows: “In the month\r\nof February, of the year 1725, I received the lamentable news that the\r\nfather of the country, the emperor Peter I had departed this life. I\r\nwatered this paper with my tears, both out of duty to my sovereign and\r\nin remembrance of his many kindnesses and favours to me; verily I do not\r\nlie when I say that I was unconscious for more than twenty-four hours,\r\nfor it would have been sinful for me to have been otherwise. This monarch\r\nbrought our country into equality with others; he taught us to know that\r\nwe, too, are men; in a word, whatever you look upon in Russia was all\r\nbegun by him, and whatever will be done in future will be drawn from the\r\nsame source; as to me personally, above what I have already written, the\r\nsovereign was a good and merciful father. May the Lord grant to his soul,\r\nwhich laboured so greatly for the common good, rest with the righteous!”\r\n\r\nAnother person who was in close contact with Peter (Nartov) says: “If\r\nit should ever happen to a philosopher to look through the archives\r\nof Peter’s secret acts, he would shudder with horror at what was done\r\nagainst the monarch. We who were the servants of that great sovereign\r\nsigh and shed tears, when we sometimes hear reproaches against the\r\nhard-heartedness and cruelty which were not in reality to be met with\r\nin him. If many knew what he endured and by what sorrows he was cut\r\nto the heart, if they knew how indulgent he was to the weaknesses of\r\nhumanity and how he forgave crimes that did not deserve mercy they would\r\nbe amazed. And although Peter the Great is no longer with us, yet his\r\nspirit lives in our souls, and we, who had the felicity of being near\r\nthis monarch, shall die faithful to him, and the ardent love we had for\r\nour earthly god will be buried together with us. We are not afraid to\r\nproclaim the deeds of our father, in order that a noble fearlessness and\r\ntruth shall be learned from them.”[i]\r\n\r\n\r\nKOSTOMAROV’S ESTIMATE OF PETER\r\n\r\nAs an historical character Peter presents an original phenomenon, not\r\nonly in the history of Russia but in the history of all humanity, of all\r\nages and all nations. The immortal Shakespeare by his artistic genius\r\ncreated in Hamlet an inimitable type of a man in whom reflection takes\r\nthe ascendancy over his will and does not permit him to give substance\r\nor effect to his desires and intentions. In Peter not the genius of\r\nthe artist, understanding the meaning of human nature, but nature\r\nherself created the opposite type--that of a man with an irresistible,\r\nindefatigable will in whom every thought was at once transformed into\r\naction. “I will it, because I count it good, and what I will must\r\ninfallibly be”--such was the device of the whole life and work of this\r\nman.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A KABARDINIAN]\r\n\r\nHe was distinguished by an aptitude and enterprise unattainable for\r\nordinary mortals. Not having received any regular education, he wished\r\nto know everything and was obliged to study a great deal; however, the\r\nRussian czar was gifted with such a wealth of capacities that even with\r\nhis short preparation he astounded persons who had spent their lives over\r\nwhat Peter only studied by the way. All that he learned he endeavoured\r\nto apply in Russia in order to transform her into a mighty European\r\nstate. This was the thought that he cherished sincerely and wholly during\r\nthe continuation of his entire life. Peter lived at a time when it was\r\nimpossible for Russia to remain in the same beaten track, but must\r\nnecessarily enter upon the path of renovation. Being gifted with mental\r\nclearsightedness, he recognised this necessity of his fatherland and set\r\nabout the task with all the force of his gigantic will.\r\n\r\nPeter’s autocracy, inherited from his forefathers, helped him more than\r\nanything. He created the army and the fleet, although for this was\r\nrequired an innumerable multitude of human sacrifices and the fruits of\r\nmany years of national labour. All was offered by the people for this\r\nobject, although the people itself did not clearly understand it and\r\ntherefore did not desire it; but everything was given because the czar\r\nwished it. Incredible taxes were imposed, hundreds of thousands of the\r\nhealthy young generation were sent to the war or to hard and painful\r\nlabour never to return again. The people were ruined and impoverished in\r\norder that Russia might gain the sea, that she might extend her frontiers\r\nand organise an army capable of being measured against its neighbours.\r\nThe Russians had grown attached to their ancient manners and customs,\r\nthey hated everything foreign; immersed in outward forms of piety, they\r\nshowed an aversion to the sciences. The autocratic czar compelled them to\r\nadopt foreign dress, to study foreign sciences, to disdain the customs of\r\ntheir forefathers, and to forswear their most sacred traditions. And the\r\nRussians mastered themselves; they were obedient because it was the wish\r\nof their autocratic sovereign.\r\n\r\nDuring the whole of his reign Peter struggled against the prejudices and\r\nevil nature of his subjects and dependants; he prosecuted embezzlers\r\nof the public funds, takers of bribes, imposters, and lamented that\r\nthings were not done in Russia as he could have wished. His partisans\r\nsought and even now seek to find in all this the cause of the obdurate\r\nvices and defects of the ancient Russian. But looking into the matter\r\ndispassionately, it follows that much must be ascribed to the character\r\nof Peter’s action. It is impossible to make a man happy against his own\r\nwill or to force his nature. History shows us that, in a despotically\r\nruled society, the vices that chiefly hinder the fulfilment of the\r\nmost laudable and salutary preconceived designs of the power are most\r\nfrequently and saliently manifested. What were the measures that Peter\r\nemployed for bringing his great reforms to fulfilment? The tortures\r\nof the Preobrajenski Edict and the secret chancery, sentences of a\r\npainful death, prisons, the galleys, the knout, the tearing of the\r\nnostrils, espionage, the encouragement by rewards of informers. It is\r\ncomprehensible that by such means Peter could inoculate neither civil\r\ncourage, nor the feeling of duty, nor that love for one’s neighbour\r\nwhich is above all material or intellectual forces and more powerful\r\nthan knowledge itself; in a word, although he established a multitude of\r\ninstitutions and created a new political organisation for Russia, yet\r\nPeter was not able to create a living, new Russia.\r\n\r\nPossessed by the abstract idea of the state and sacrificing to this idea\r\nthe temporary prosperity of the people, Peter did not act sincerely by\r\nthe people. For him they only existed as the ciphers in a total--as the\r\nmaterial good for the construction of the edifice of the state. He valued\r\nthe Russian people as far as they were necessary to him in creating\r\nsoldiers, masons, excavators, sailors; or, by their laboriously earned\r\nkopeck, in furnishing him with means for the maintenance of the state\r\nmechanism. Peter himself by his personality might serve as a model for\r\nthe people he ruled over and transformed only in his boundless, untiring\r\nlove of work; but in nowise by the moral qualities of his character. He\r\ndid not even endeavour to restrain his passions, which not unfrequently\r\nled him to furious outbursts and bloody actions, although he severely\r\npunished like actions in those he ruled over. Peter allowed drunkenness\r\nand double dealing in himself, yet he prosecuted these same vices in his\r\nsubjects. Many shocking actions that he committed have been justified by\r\nthe sophisms of political necessity. To what an extent his ferocity and\r\nbloodthirstiness were carried is shown by the fact that he was not afraid\r\nto lower his royal dignity by taking upon himself the office of hangman\r\nduring the time of the savage execution of the strelitz. Throughout his\r\nreign a bloody vapour arose from those who were tortured and put to death\r\nin accordance with the Preobrajenski Edict and contaminated the air of\r\nRussia, but it evidently did not trouble the slumbers of her sovereign.\r\n\r\nPeter himself justified his cruel punishments by the requirements of\r\njustice, but facts prove that he was not equally inflexible in his\r\njustice to all and did not set an example to others in the indulgence\r\nhe showed to his favourite, Menshikov, at whose hands such iniquities\r\nwere committed as would have cost others their lives. His own outward\r\npolitical actions were not distinguished by irreproachable integrity and\r\nrectitude; the Northern War can never be justified from the point of view\r\nof justice. It is also impossible to call honourable the expedient Peter\r\nmade use of with the English king George when, in spite of the clearest\r\nevidence, he assured him of his devotion and non-participation in the\r\npretender’s designs. How far Peter respected the rights of neighbouring\r\nforeign nations when he had no reason to fear them is shown by his savage\r\nbehaviour to the uniat monks of Polosk--an action for which he himself\r\nwould have probably punished by death any one of his subjects who had\r\nthus dared to take the law into his own hands in a foreign land.\r\n\r\nAll the dark sides of Peter’s character may of course be easily excused\r\nby the features of the age in which he lived; it may justly be pointed\r\nout to us that for the greater part such traits are also to be found in\r\nthe characters of his contemporaries. It remains indubitable that Peter\r\nsurpassed the sovereigns contemporary with him by the vastness of his\r\nintellect and by his untiring love of work; but in moral respects he was\r\nnot better than many of them; and it was for this reason that the society\r\nwhich he wished to re-create did not rise superior to those societies\r\nwhich were governed by Peter’s contemporaries. Until Peter’s reign Russia\r\nwas plunged in ignorance; and, boasting of her bigoted, ceremonial piety,\r\nglorified herself with the name of the New Israel, whilst in reality she\r\nwas by no means a “new Israel.” By his despotic measures Peter created\r\nout of her a monarchy that was a terror to foreigners by her army and\r\nfleet; he communicated to the upper class of her people the outward marks\r\nof European civilisation; yet Russia after Peter did not in reality\r\nbecome the “new Israel” that she had desired to be before his time.\r\n\r\nAll Peter’s pupils, the men of new Russia who outlived him, were\r\nentangled in their own snares; following their own egotistical aims, they\r\nperished on the scaffold or in exile, and the Russian public man adopted\r\nin his conscience the rule that he might do anything he found profitable,\r\nalthough it might be immoral, justifying himself by the fact that other\r\nnations did the same. Yet, in spite of all this, as a historical royal\r\nworker Peter has preserved for us in his personality such an exalted\r\nmoral trait that it involuntarily draws our heart to him; this trait is\r\nhis devotion to the ideal to which he wholly consecrated his soul during\r\nall his lifetime. He loved Russia, loved the Russian people, loved it\r\nin the sense of the mass of Russian men who were his contemporaries and\r\nsubjects in the sense of that ideal to which he desired to bring his\r\npeople; and this love constitutes in him that great quality which incites\r\nus, beyond our own will, to love his personality, setting aside both his\r\nbloody tribunal and all his demoralising despotism reflecting a baneful\r\ninfluence even on posterity. Because of Peter’s love for the ideal of the\r\nRussian people, the Russians will love Peter until he himself loses the\r\nnational ideal, and for the sake of this love they will forgive him all\r\nthat a heavy burden has laid upon his memory.[d]\r\n\r\n\r\nHAXTAUSEN’S ESTIMATE OF PETER’S INFLUENCE\r\n\r\nFrom the sixteenth to the seventeenth centuries a national spirit\r\ndominated entirely. Moreover, Russian sovereigns had, for many years,\r\nperceived that the people were behind other nations who had sprung into\r\nbeing as late as themselves or who were inferior either in origin or in\r\nphysical or intellectual faculties. To remedy this tardy growth they\r\nconceived it necessary to put themselves into direct contact with the\r\nwest in order to borrow its light and imitate its progress. The best\r\nway of accomplishing this was, they thought, to get as many foreigners\r\nas possible into the country to train the young; to give the state\r\nnew institutions, and remodel the old on western principles. Ivan\r\nVasilievitch had already drawn a crowd of foreigners, and particularly\r\nGermans; had even tried to put his army on a European footing. The\r\nsuccessors of the Romanov branch followed zealously in this path, but no\r\nprince felt more strongly than Peter I the necessity of letting Russia\r\ntake a foremost place in Europe. His quick impetuous nature detested slow\r\nand incomplete measures. To him, to sow without reaping, or prune without\r\ntasting the fruits, was labour provoking all his repugnance.\r\n\r\nThe impetus he gave Russia is that in which she still continues.\r\nEverywhere in the public and social life of this people is to be noticed\r\nthe impulse he gave. It is an accomplished fact that no human power\r\ncan annul; so all inquiry to find out if this impetus was necessary\r\nand favourable to Russia would be inopportune and sterile. There is,\r\nhowever, no doubt that in Peter’s haste in his work of reform he did\r\nnot sufficiently consider national things both great and good; that he\r\nintroduced a crowd of foreign innovations, some mediocre, some positively\r\nbad, without pausing to think whether they were suitable to the climate,\r\nthe established order of things, or if they would fit in harmoniously\r\nwith Russian nationality.[j]\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES\r\n\r\n[39] A verst is 3500 English feet and a sazhen 7 feet.\r\n\r\n[40] The ancient Borysthenes.\r\n\r\n[41] [Porte is the name given to the chief office of the Ottoman\r\ngovernment, so called from the gate of the palace at which justice\r\nwas administered.

CATHERINE I TO PETER III\r\n\r\n\r\nCATHERINE I (1725-1727 A.D.)\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [1725-1727 A.D.]]\r\n\r\nAt the death of Peter the Great two powerful parties were arrayed against\r\neach other, one supporting his youthful grandson Alexievitch, and the\r\nother advancing the claims of Catherine, the Livonian. The Galitzins,\r\nthe Dolgoruki, Repnins, and all Old Russia wished to crown Peter’s son,\r\nAlexis; but those who owed their elevation to Peter I, or had been\r\ninvolved in the suit against his son, as well as the members of the\r\ntribunal that had condemned the czarevitch, felt that their only hope of\r\nsafety lay in raising Catherine to the throne. This party, counting among\r\nits numbers the most capable and enlightened men, still held the highest\r\nauthority in the administration and in the army, and its adversaries felt\r\nthat a compromise was the most that they could expect. Dmitri Galitzin\r\nproposed to proclaim Peter II, but only under the guardianship of the\r\nwidowed empress.\r\n\r\nTolstoi combated this proposition by showing that it was the surest\r\nmethod of arming parties against each other, of furnishing hostile\r\nfactions a pretext for inciting the people to rebellion against the\r\nregent. He demonstrated that in the absence of the testamentary\r\ndisposition she had the best right to succeed Peter I; furthermore, she\r\nhad been solemnly crowned, had received the oath of allegiance from her\r\nsubjects, had been initiated into all the state secrets, and had learned\r\nfrom her husband the art of reigning. The officers and regiments of the\r\nguards declared energetically in favour of the heroine of Pruth, and\r\nit was finally decided that she should reign alone, with an authority\r\nas absolute as that of her dead husband. This was a greater novelty in\r\nRussia than the regency of Sophia; Catherine was not only a woman, but\r\na foreigner, a captive, and a second wife, scarcely to be considered as\r\na wife at all. Many were the protests against a decision which excluded\r\nfrom the throne the grandson of Peter the Great, and certain of the\r\n_raskolniks_ submitted to the torture rather than swear allegiance to a\r\nwoman.\r\n\r\nMenshikov, one of Catherine’s earlier lovers, now became all-powerful. He\r\nstopped the suit for mal-administration that the late czar had commenced\r\nagainst him, and obtained for himself Baturin, the former capital of\r\nMazeppa, which was equivalent to the principality of Ukraine. His\r\ndespotic and evil character rendered him odious to his companions and\r\ndiscord everywhere broke out among the “eaglets” of Peter the Great.\r\nIagushinski publicly lamented on the tomb of the czar, and Tolstoi was\r\nlater exiled to Siberia. Catherine, however, restrained the ambition of\r\nher favourite and refused to sacrifice her other councillors to him.\r\n\r\nCatherine’s rule, which was a continuation of that of Peter the Great,\r\ngave the lie to the pessimistic predictions that had announced the\r\nabandonment of St. Petersburg and the fleet, and the return to Moscow.\r\nThe greater part of the plans for reform entertained by the czar were\r\nput in execution. The Academy of Sciences was inaugurated in 1726, the\r\npublication of the _Gazette_ was carefully supervised, the order of\r\nAlexander Nevski, originated by Peter, was founded, the Danish captain\r\nBéhring was placed at the head of the Kamchatka scientific expedition,\r\nChasirov, recalled from exile, was commanded to write the history of\r\nPeter the Great, and Anna Petrovna was solemnly married to the duke of\r\nHolstein, to whom she had been affianced by her father. On the other hand\r\nthe senate and the holy synod lost their title of Directors, and the\r\naffairs of state were given into the hands of the secret high council\r\nwhich sat under the presidency of the empress and was composed of\r\nMenshikov, the admiral Apraxin, the chancellor Golovkin, Tolstoi, Dmitri\r\nGalitzin, and the vice-chancellor Ostermann.\r\n\r\nOn her death-bed Catherine designated as her successor Peter Alexievitch,\r\nthe grandson of her husband, and in default of Peter her two daughters\r\nAnna of Holstein and Elizabeth. Pending the majority of the youthful\r\nemperor the regency was to be conducted by a council composed of Anna and\r\nElizabeth, the duke of Holstein, Menshikov, Apraxin, Golovkin, Ostermann,\r\nand others; but Menshikov after the first sitting took the duties of\r\nregent upon himself.\r\n\r\n\r\nPETER II (1727-1730 A.D.)\r\n\r\nThe empress died on the 17th of May, 1727, and on the following day the\r\nnobility and clergy assembled in the palace to be present at the reading\r\nof the will by which Peter was made emperor of all the Russias. Menshikov\r\nhad taken measures to retain his high position and even to increase\r\nhis power under the new reign. With the design of removing all those\r\nwho might be detrimental to him he banished Apraxin from court, sent\r\nIagushinski to Ukraine and despatched Makarov on a mission to the mines\r\nof Siberia. Menshikov had further obtained Catherine’s consent to the\r\nbetrothal of his daughter to the young prince. He gave his own palace as\r\na residence for the emperor and surrounded him with men on whose devotion\r\nhe could count. He assumed the title of generalissimo and signed his\r\nletters to his sovereign “your father.” He caused the members of his own\r\nfamily to be inscribed in the almanac beside those of the imperial house,\r\nand had his daughters mentioned in the public prayers; he also planned\r\nto obtain the hand of Peter’s sister, Natalia Alexievna, for his son in\r\naddition to marrying his daughter to the emperor.\r\n\r\nPeter II soon began to chafe under the rule of the generalissimo.\r\nMenshikov had appointed Ostermann to be his tutor, but the young prince\r\nhated study and preferred to spend his days hunting with his favourite,\r\nIvan Dolgoruki. The adroit Ostermann excused himself to the prince for\r\nthe disagreeable nature of his pedagogic duties, and contrived to cast\r\nall the blame on Menshikov. The emperor one day sent a present of 9,000\r\nducats to his sister Natalia, and Menshikov insolently confiscated them\r\nwith the remark that the “emperor was too young to know the proper use of\r\nmoney.” Peter II rebelled at this and it was with difficulty that the\r\nprince appeased him. The generalissimo had another enemy in the person\r\nof Elizabeth, daughter of Peter the Great and aunt of Peter II. She was\r\nseventeen years old at the time, gay, careless, and lively, with a bright\r\ncomplexion and blue eyes; her laughter drove the insupportable tutor from\r\nhis office.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [1728 A.D.]]\r\n\r\nAn illness which overtook Menshikov and kept him absent for a time from\r\ncourt prepared his downfall; Peter II accustomed himself to the idea of\r\ngetting rid of him. When the prince returned and began again to oppose\r\nthe young ruler’s wishes the latter left Menshikov’s house, caused\r\nall the crown furniture to be removed from it to the imperial palace,\r\ntreated his affianced wife with marked coldness, and finally gave orders\r\nto the guards that they were to obey no commands save those given by\r\ntheir colonels. This was the prelude to an overwhelming disgrace; in\r\nSeptember, 1727, Menshikov was arrested, stripped of all his dignities\r\nand decorations, and banished to his own lands.\r\n\r\nThe Dolgorukis profited by the revolution they had caused. They fell,\r\nhowever, into Menshikov’s error and oppressed the prince with the same\r\nofficious care. Like Menshikov they banished all who gave them offence,\r\neven Ostermann for whom Peter began to feel affection, and the old\r\nczarina, Eudoxia Lapukhin, who had been liberated from the prison in\r\nLadoga. Advancing as a pretext certain placards in which the services of\r\nMenshikov were extolled, they exiled the latter to Berezov, in Siberia,\r\nwhere he died in 1729. Taking no lesson by his example they imposed on\r\nthe prince a new bride, Catherine Dolgoruki, sister of his favourite,\r\nIvan. Their administration bore all the character of a reaction against\r\nthe reforms instituted by Peter the Great.\r\n\r\nIn 1728, when the young emperor went to Moscow for his coronation, he\r\nwas warmly received by the people. Ostermann, however, and all the other\r\nfaithful servants of the “giant czar” were chagrined at the return of\r\nthe court to Moscow and its indifference to European affairs in general.\r\nIn order to gain more complete possession of their master the Dolgoruki\r\nencouraged his taste for dissipation and took him away on hunting\r\nexpeditions that lasted weeks at a time. Peter would certainly have\r\ngrown as weary of them as he had of Menshikov: and to the complaints\r\nof his aunt Elizabeth that she was left without money he had already\r\nreplied: “It is not my fault: they do not execute my orders; but I shall\r\nfind means to break my chains.” The crisis came about in a different\r\nmanner from what had been expected; the young emperor caught cold while\r\nattending the ceremony of the benediction of the waters, and died of\r\nsmallpox at the age of fourteen years and four months. The two reigns\r\nof Catherine and Peter II, which lasted in all about five years, were\r\npeaceful.\r\n\r\nIn 1726 Russia had concluded an alliance with the court of Vienna and in\r\n1727 it became involved in the war of the Quadruple Alliance. Despite the\r\nefforts of Campredon and Kurakin the failure of the project of marriage\r\nbetween Louis XV and Elizabeth had brought about coolness between France\r\nand Russia. The most remarkable episode of the foreign relations was\r\nthe attempt of Maurice of Saxony, illegitimate son of King Augustus, to\r\nobtain possession of the duchy of Courland. The offer of his hand had\r\nbeen accepted by the widowed Anna Ivanovna, and he had been elected at\r\nMittau by the deputies of the nobility. Disregarding the protestations\r\nof Prussia, Russia, and the Polish diet, he levied a body of troops with\r\nthe money raised by the sale of the jewels belonging to an abbess of\r\nQuedlinburg, a certain French actress, his mother Aurora of Königsmark,\r\nand Adrienne Lecouvreur, and set about putting his duchy in a state of\r\ndefence. His father disavowed him and Cardinal Fleury did not venture to\r\nsupport him even indirectly. Menshikov, restored to greater liberty since\r\nthe death of Catherine I, himself laid claims to the duchy. He despatched\r\nLacy at the head of eight thousand men to drive out the Saxon adventurer.\r\nThe future victor of Fontenoy could get together no more than 247, and\r\nwas obliged to swim across an arm of the sea in his retreat. His election\r\nwas annulled, his father publicly reviled him as a _galopin_, or rascal,\r\nand Courland came once more under Russian influence.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [1730 A.D.]]\r\n\r\nDuring the reign of Peter II a treaty was signed with Prussia by virtue\r\nof which the two powers pledged themselves to sustain, on the death of\r\nAugustus II, the candidate they might choose for Poland. The emperor\r\nCharles VI and the “sergeant king” sounded Russia as to the eventual\r\ndismemberment of the Polish Republic. This was not the first time that\r\nthe question of partition was brought forward. In Asia, Iagushinski\r\nconcluded on the Bura a treaty of commerce with the Celestial Empire\r\nin the name of Peter II, by the terms of which Russian caravans could\r\njourney to Pekin every three years and could carry on their trade\r\ntoll-free. Russia was also to have the privilege of keeping four priests\r\nand six young men in Pekin to learn Chinese. Kiakhta on the Russian\r\nterritory and Maimatchin on the Chinese were to be the authorised\r\ndepots.[f]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PRINCE ALEXANDER MENSHIKOV]\r\n\r\nThe death of Peter II was universally regretted in Russia. During his\r\nreign, the empire enjoyed tranquillity at home and peace abroad; and\r\nhe discovered such excellent qualities for government that the people\r\nlooked forward to enjoying under his rule a period of freedom and\r\nprosperity such as they had never before experienced. There is no doubt,\r\nhowever, that if he had survived his own good intentions would have been\r\nperverted by those advisers who had obtained so strong a hold upon his\r\nmind. His predilection for Moscow had already produced serious injury to\r\nthe maritime affairs of St. Petersburg: the fleet and the army suffered\r\nseverely by his continued absence from the capital; and had he lived to\r\ncomplete the change by which he meditated Russia must have ultimately\r\nlost, by the neglect of her great station on the Neva, the national\r\nconsequence she had maintained amongst the states of Europe during the\r\ntwo previous reigns. It was evident, also, that he would gradually have\r\ndiscouraged the residence of foreigners in his dominions; and that the\r\nold families were acquiring such power at court that they would finally\r\nhave succeeded in restoring those national usages which had been set\r\naside by Peter the Great. If the people, therefore, were deprived on the\r\none hand of the temporary advantages of a tranquil reign, Russia on the\r\nother was preserved from the risk of permanent evils.\r\n\r\nDisappointed in their expectations of an alliance with the emperor,\r\nthe Dalgoruki did not wholly relinquish their hopes of securing some\r\nadvantage by their position. The young Dalgoruki, impatient of delay,\r\nforged a testament in the name of Peter II, in which Catherine Dalgoruki\r\nwas named as the successor to the throne. With this instrument in one\r\nhand and a drawn sword in the other he rushed into the hall, where the\r\nsenators were assembled in deliberation, and cried aloud, “Long live the\r\nempress Dalgoruki!” But no voice seconding him in this wild and shallow\r\ntrick, he sheathed his sword, and suppressed the fraudulent testament.\r\n\r\nThe question of the succession was now to be considered; and the only\r\nauthentic document by which the proceedings of the council could be\r\nregulated was the will of Catherine I, which devised the succession\r\nto the princess Anna and her posterity, or, in failure, the princess\r\nElizabeth. But Anna had died two years before, and her husband the duke\r\nof Holstein had retired into Germany. It was true that there was a young\r\nprince, the issue of this marriage; but the council were so averse to\r\nthe introduction of foreigners into the state that they decided at once\r\nagainst any claim that might be set up in that quarter.\r\n\r\nThe princess Elizabeth, second in the order of nomination, exhibited\r\nno desire to avail herself of the testament of her mother, although\r\nshe was strongly urged to do so by Lestocq, her physician, preferring\r\nto enjoy the ease of a life unburdened by the cares of the state. In\r\nthese circumstances the council, the senate, and the great officers of\r\nstate assembled to consult upon the election of a successor to Peter II.\r\nAlthough the male line of the Romanovs was extinct in that sovereign,\r\nyet the female line was preserved in the three daughters of Ivan, the\r\nstepbrother of Peter the Great, and for some time a partner with him in\r\nthe government. The eldest was separated from her husband, the duke of\r\nMecklenburg; the second, Anna, duchess of Courland, was a widow living at\r\nMittau; and the third was still unmarried, residing at St. Petersburg.\r\nThe objection that was entertained against foreign alliances determined\r\nthe senate to reject the claims of the first, and the choice consequently\r\nfell upon Anna Ivanovna.\r\n\r\n\r\nANNA IVANOVNA (1730-1740 A.D.)\r\n\r\nFrom the time of the death of Catherine I the prejudice against\r\nforeigners had insensibly acquired weight amongst those influential\r\npersons who surrounded the throne. The Dolgoruki were the most active\r\nagents of this sentiment, through which they hoped at last to reap the\r\nlargest share of profit themselves. Taking advantage of the jealousy\r\nin which the old aristocracy held their privileges, and apprehensive\r\nthat the new sovereign might act upon the system of her immediate\r\npredecessors, they struck upon an expedient by which they hoped to\r\ndeprive her of the power of exercising her own judgment, and to place\r\nher under the control of that irresponsible council which had been\r\ninstituted by Catherine I. “The welfare of the nation,” said Galitzin,\r\nin an address to the assembly, “demands that the supreme authority and\r\nthe unlimited power of the sovereign, by which Russia has suffered so\r\nmuch and which has been sustained chiefly by the influx of foreigners,\r\nshould be circumscribed, and that the crown should be conferred upon the\r\nnew sovereign under certain conditions.” This proposal was received with\r\nuniversal approbation, and the following conditions were unanimously\r\nagreed to:\r\n\r\nThat the empress should govern solely by the resolves of the high privy\r\ncouncil; that she was not, of her own motion, either to wage war or\r\nmake peace; that she could not, of herself, impose any new tax upon the\r\npeople; that she could not dispose of any important office, nor inflict\r\ncapital punishment on any nobleman, nor confiscate his estate, unless\r\nhe had been previously convicted of the crime laid to his charge; that\r\nshe should not alienate any lands belonging to the crown; and that she\r\ncould not marry, or nominate an heir, without obtaining, in the first\r\ninstance, the consent of the council. A strange article was added to\r\nthese conditions--that her chamberlain, von Biren, should not accompany\r\nthe empress into Russia.\r\n\r\nThese conditions, which were apparently intended to curb the tyranny of\r\nthe throne, aimed at nothing more than the abolition of one description\r\nof despotism, for the purpose of substituting a worse in its stead.\r\nIf it abrogated the supreme and unlimited power of the sovereign, it\r\ntransferred that power to the secret council, which was thus elevated\r\nabove the sovereignty and the senate and invested with a complete control\r\nover the administration of the public affairs. The proposed change was\r\nfrom an unlimited monarchy to an irresponsible oligarchy.\r\n\r\nThe drift of this capitulation was speedily detected by those whose\r\ninterests it affected--the aristocracy. They saw that it concentrated\r\nthe power of the state in the hands of seven persons; that the Dolgoruki\r\nhad already possessed themselves of the voice of the council; and that\r\nthe issue would be the sacrifice of the empire to a family contract. The\r\ncapitulation, therefore, was scarcely passed when a powerful opposition\r\nwas raised up against it; and the people, accustomed to the despotism\r\nof an unlimited sovereignty, from which, amidst all its severities,\r\nthey had derived many valuable safeguards and benefits, declared that\r\nthey preferred rendering obedience to one master instead of seven. This\r\nfeeling rapidly spread amongst the guards, who had good reasons for\r\nobjecting to a clause which would throw the patronage of the army into\r\nthe hands of a few persons, who, instead of promoting the meritorious,\r\nwould, as a matter of course, provide for their own friends and relatives.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ANNA IVANOVNA\r\n\r\n(1693-1740)]\r\n\r\nNor was the princess Anna insensible to the wrong which she suffered from\r\nthis novel procedure; and, when the deputation from the council waited\r\nupon her to inform her of her election, and the conditions which were\r\nannexed to it, she would have refused to subscribe to the capitulation,\r\nhad she not been already prepared by the advice of General Iagushinski\r\nas to the course she ought to pursue. That officer had previously\r\nrecommended her to accept the conditions, but to revoke them immediately\r\nafter she should be acknowledged as empress, assuring her, at the same\r\ntime, that she would be powerfully supported in the proper quarter. She\r\naccordingly agreed to the demands of the deputation, and was crowned in\r\nthe usual forms.\r\n\r\nThe empress Anna was no sooner established upon the throne, than her\r\nfriends gave her an opportunity of carrying the advice of General\r\nIagushinski into effect. A petition signed by several hundred noblemen\r\nwas presented to her, in which she was entreated to abrogate the\r\nrestrictions which the council had placed upon her authority, and to\r\nassume the unlimited power that had hitherto been exercised by her\r\npredecessors. Fortified by this requisition, the empress presented\r\nherself before the council and the senate, and, reading the terms of the\r\ncapitulation, demanded whether such was the will of the nation. Being\r\nanswered in the negative by the majority of those who were present,\r\nshe exclaimed, “Then there is no further need of this paper,” and tore\r\nthe capitulation in pieces. This act was ratified and published in a\r\nmanifesto which declared that the empress ascended the throne not by\r\nelection but by hereditary right, and which exacted from the people\r\nan oath of allegiance, not to the sovereign and the country, as had\r\nformerly been the case, but to the empress alone, as unlimited sovereign,\r\nincluding not only the rights of sovereignty already existing but those\r\nthat might be asserted hereafter.\r\n\r\nAnna was now empress without conditions, and her chamberlain, von Biren,\r\nwas raised to that place in her councils which Menshikov filled during\r\nthe reign of Catherine I. The first exercise she made of her power was to\r\nabolish the council of seven and to restore to the senate the privileges\r\nit enjoyed under Peter the Great. She appointed, however, a cabinet\r\nof three persons, with Ostermann at its head, whose duty it was to\r\nsuperintend the affairs of the most pressing importance, leaving to the\r\nsenate the management of less momentous matters. When these arrangements\r\nwere completed, the urgent attention of the empress was directed to the\r\nforeign relations of the empire, which, at this crisis, demanded serious\r\nconsideration.\r\n\r\nThe struggle for the throne in Poland had entailed jealousies which\r\nthreatened not only to involve the peace of Russia but to draw France and\r\nSweden into the quarrel. The cause of Augustus, the elector of Saxony,\r\nwhich had originally been espoused by Peter I, was still maintained\r\nby the Russian cabinet; and, although France made strenuous exertions\r\nto reinstate Stanislaus, the father-in-law of Louis XV, yet, by the\r\ndetermined interference of his northern ally, Augustus was proclaimed\r\nking of Poland, and Stanislaus was compelled to fly. The mortification\r\nwhich France endured under these circumstances excited in her a strong\r\nfeeling of hostility against Russia; but there existed still more cogent\r\nreasons why she should make an attempt to restrain the advances of that\r\npower.\r\n\r\nIt had long been a favourite point in the policy of France to secure\r\nupon the throne of Poland a monarch who should be devoted to her will,\r\nand although she had been hitherto defeated in that object, she did not\r\nrelinquish the hope of its ultimate accomplishment. She saw also rising\r\nin the north a gigantic empire, which had already acquired extraordinary\r\npower in Europe, and which threatened at last to overshadow and destroy\r\nthe influence which she had been accustomed to exercise in that part of\r\nthe globe. Urged by these considerations, and knowing how important it\r\nwas to Russia to be at peace with Sweden, she left no means untried to\r\nengage the court at Stockholm on her side. Her diplomacy succeeded even\r\nbetter than she expected and Russia was once more compelled to watch with\r\nvigilance the movements of a dangerous neighbour, who was still suffering\r\nunder the disastrous effects of a war from which Russia had reaped all\r\nthe benefits and she the misfortunes.\r\n\r\nBut affairs pressed with still greater energy in a more remote quarter.\r\nIt was found by experience that the territories which Peter had acquired\r\nin Persia by the treaty entered into between him, the sultan, and the\r\nshah were exceedingly burdensome to the country. In his desire for\r\nthe enlargement of his dominions, Peter overlooked the necessity of\r\nascertaining whether the new provinces were likely to be productive of\r\nadvantages, either in the way of revenue or as adding strength to the\r\nfrontiers. In order to preserve the possession of those provinces, it\r\nwas necessary to maintain a considerable garrison in the interior, even\r\nin time of peace; they were also frequently exposed to scenes of warfare\r\nand devastation; and the climate was so injurious to the health of the\r\nRussians that in the course of a few years no less than 130,000 men\r\nperished there.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [1735 A.D.]]\r\n\r\nThe great cost of these dependencies, and their uselessness in a\r\nterritorial point of view, determined Anna to relinquish them upon the\r\nbest terms she could procure from the shah. She accordingly proposed to\r\nthat prince the restoration of the conquered provinces, upon condition\r\nthat he would grant to the Russian merchants certain commercial\r\nprivileges in the trade with Persia. To these terms the shah acceded, and\r\nin 1735 Russia made a formal surrender of her Persian possessions. This\r\nnegotiation was connected with another of still greater importance--a\r\ndefensive treaty between Persia and Russia, which was concluded at the\r\nsame time. The motives which induced Anna to enter into this alliance\r\nrequire a brief recapitulation of preceding events.\r\n\r\nThe unfortunate situation in which Peter I was placed upon the banks\r\nof the Pruth compelled him to submit to the terms dictated by the\r\nPorte, by which he surrendered many important advantages which he had\r\npreviously obtained by conquest. The principal sacrifices he had made\r\nupon that occasion were the evacuation of Azov and the destruction of the\r\nfortifications at Taganrog which had the immediate effect of shutting him\r\nout from the trade on the Euxine. The annoyances also to which the empire\r\nwas subjected by the frequent incursions of the Crimean and other Tatars\r\ninto the border lands, where they committed the most frightful excesses,\r\nand the haughty refusal of the Porte to acknowledge the imperial title\r\nwhich the people had conferred upon him, led Peter to meditate a new war\r\nagainst the Turks. He made ample preparations for the fulfilment of this\r\ndesign by fortifying the frontiers in the neighbourhood of Turkey; but\r\nhis death arrested the execution of the project, which was entirely laid\r\naside by Catherine I and Peter II.\r\n\r\nAnna, however, relying upon the assistance of thirty thousand auxiliaries\r\nfrom Germany, considered this a favourable opportunity for reviving a\r\nstroke of policy which promised such signal advantages to the country,\r\nparticularly as the Turk was at this period employed in hostilities\r\nagainst Persia. She did not long want an excuse for opening the war.\r\nThe Tatars had of late made several predatory inroads upon the Russian\r\nterritories, and laying waste the districts through which they passed\r\ncarried off men and cattle on their return. These Tatars being under the\r\nprotection of the Porte, the empress remonstrated upon the subject, and\r\ndemanded satisfaction; but the sultan, in his reply, excused himself from\r\ninterfering in the matter, upon the pretext that it was impossible to\r\nkeep those roving bands under proper restraint. This evasive reply was\r\nprecisely what Anna anticipated, and as the sultan declined to render\r\nher any atonement, she undertook to obtain retribution for herself. A\r\nforce was immediately despatched into the country of the Tatars, which\r\nthey overran, spreading ruin in their path, and destroying the marauders\r\nin great numbers. The expedition failed, however, in consequence of the\r\nincautious advance of the troops too far into the interior, where, not\r\nbeing prepared with a sufficient stock of provisions, they underwent\r\nsevere privations, and sustained a loss of ten thousand men.\r\n\r\nBut this discomfiture did not divert the empress from her grand design;\r\nand in the year 1736 Count Munich, at the head of a sufficient force,\r\nwas sent into the Ukraine, with a free commission to retaliate upon the\r\nTatars. After a victorious course through that region, he passed into\r\nthe peninsula of the Crimea; the Tatars, unequal to contending with him\r\nin the open field, flying before him until they reached their lines,\r\nextending from the sea of Azov to the Euxine, behind the intrenchments of\r\nwhich they considered themselves secure. The lines were established with\r\na view to protecting the Crimea from any attack on the land side; and,\r\nhaving been built with incredible toil, and being strongly fortified with\r\ncannon, the Tatars deemed them impregnable. They did not long, however,\r\nwithstand the vigorous assault of the Russians, who speedily scaled them,\r\nand, driving the tumultuous hordes before them, soon possessed themselves\r\nof the greater part of the Crimea. But the same inconveniences were felt\r\non this as on the former expedition. The Tatars on their flight laid the\r\ncountry in ashes, and it was impossible to provide sustenance for the\r\ntroops without keeping up a constant communication with the Ukraine,\r\nwhere provisions at least were to be had, but which was attended with\r\ngreat difficulty. In this exigency, Count Munich was obliged to return to\r\nthe Ukraine, to take up his winter quarters.\r\n\r\n\r\n_War with Turkey_\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [1737 A.D.]]\r\n\r\nWhile Munich was thus engaged against the Tatars, a much more important\r\nmovement, in which the real object of the Russian government was directly\r\nexhibited, was taking place elsewhere. General Lacy had laid siege to\r\nAzov, and reduced it to submission on the 1st of July, in the same year.\r\nThis bold and decisive step forced the reluctant Divan to take into\r\nconsideration the means by which the progress of the Russians could be\r\nmost effectually stayed. The sultan was unwilling to commit himself in\r\na war with Russia, content with the possession of the advantages he\r\nhad gained by the Treaty of the Pruth; and even now that Russia had\r\nregained one of the ceded forts, and was manifestly prepared to follow\r\nup the victory, he preferred to attempt the negotiation of peace through\r\nthe mediation of Austria, for the sake of avoiding hostilities as long\r\nas he could. Russia, however, would not agree to any accommodation;\r\nand, instead of being moved from her purpose by the representations\r\nof Austria, she demanded of that power the fulfilment of the treaty\r\nsubsisting between them, by which, in case of need, she was bound to\r\nfurnish thirty thousand auxiliaries. This demand placed the subject in\r\na new light before the German cabinet. The required assistance would\r\nobviously have the effect of enabling Russia to extend her conquests\r\nwithout producing any benefits whatever to Austria; whereas, if Austria\r\nunited herself with Russia in the war, she might derive some advantages\r\nfrom an alliance against which it appeared highly improbable that the\r\nTurks could make a successful stand. She decided, therefore, upon\r\nthrowing the whole weight of her power into the scale, greatly to the\r\nconsternation of the Turks, who had, in the first instance, solicited her\r\nfriendly interference. The sultan, however, felt that, doubtful as must\r\nbe the issue of a contest against such formidable enemies, it would be\r\nwiser to risk it than, yielding to intimidation, to make such sacrifices\r\nas would be inconsistent with the security and honour of the country.\r\nHe accordingly lost no time in preparing for the campaign. He recruited\r\nthe garrisons and forts, raised new levies, put his army into proper\r\ncondition, and equipped a fleet for the protection of the Euxine; on the\r\nother hand, the combined forces rapidly prepared to act in concert.\r\n\r\nThe operations of the year 1737 were not followed by any important\r\nresults. The Russian army, strengthened by forty thousand recruits, was\r\nseparated into two divisions; one of which, under the command of Count\r\nMunich, proceeded to Otchakov on the Euxine, while General Lacy, with\r\nthe other, entered the Crimea. The objects proposed to be attained by\r\nthese expeditions were not adequate to the expenditure that attended\r\nthem. Otchakov submitted, and was garrisoned by the conquerors; and the\r\nCrimea was again desolated. This was all Russia gained by the sacrifice\r\nof about fifty thousand of her veteran troops. The blame of these barren\r\nand expensive victories was to be attributed to that very union of forces\r\nwhich ought to have been productive of increased strength. The most\r\nunfortunate jealousies existed, not only amongst the Austrian officers,\r\nbut between Count Munich and the Austrians. To so extravagant a length\r\nwas this dangerous feeling carried that, with the exception of the affair\r\nat Otchakov, Munich remained inactive throughout the campaign, from an\r\nobstinate determination not to act upon the same plan that was pursued by\r\nthe Austrians.\r\n\r\nNor was this the only evil that these feuds produced. The Turks, taking\r\nadvantage of the dissension, poured in with greater force upon the German\r\nranks, which they broke through on several occasions, gaining frequent\r\npetty advantages, which, at all events, had the effect of rendering their\r\nmovements in a great measure abortive. Constant complaints were now\r\nmade alternately by the courts of Vienna and St. Petersburg, respecting\r\nthe conduct of the officers at both sides; and, although Munich was\r\nespecially accused of thwarting the efforts of the allies, he always had\r\nthe address to escape from reprehension, by throwing the censure on his\r\naccusers.\r\n\r\nThese circumstances inspired the Turks with fresh courage. A congress\r\nhad been appointed to be held at Nemirov, in Poland, but they withdrew\r\ntheir ambassador; signifying, however, that if Russia would evacuate\r\nAzov and Otchakov, and the rest of her conquests, they might be induced\r\nto entertain a treaty of peace. This insolent proposition was at\r\nonce rejected by Russia, and the war was resumed. In the campaign of\r\nthe following year, Munich appeared to be anxious to make amends for\r\nhis former inactivity; but, although he made some vigorous marches\r\nand vindicated the character of the soldiery, he effected nothing of\r\nsubstantial importance. A similar fortune attended General Lacy in the\r\nCrimea, from which, after a disastrous progress through a desolated\r\ncountry, and after a great mortality amongst his troops, occasioned\r\npartly by fatigue and partly by the deficiency of provisions, he was\r\nultimately obliged to withdraw.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [1739 A.D.]]\r\n\r\nThe opening of the year 1739 promised to make amends for these successive\r\nfailures. General Munich, whose ability in the field was admitted on all\r\nhands, collected a numerous army at Kiev, and, crossing the Bug, met the\r\nTurks in a pitched battle, near Stavutshan, in which he obtained a signal\r\nvictory. Pursuing his success with vigour, he advanced and, passing\r\nthe Pruth, he possessed himself of Jassi, the capital of Moldavia, the\r\nwhole of which territory he subjugated in an incredibly short space\r\nof time. Retracing his march, after having achieved this important\r\nconquest, he made preparations for a descent upon Bender. These brilliant\r\ntriumphs, accomplished with such rapidity that the couriers were kept\r\nconstantly occupied in the transmission of despatches to the court of St.\r\nPetersburg, encouraged, for a brief season the flattering prospects of\r\ncomplete restitution which the unpropitious commencement of the war had\r\nalmost annihilated.\r\n\r\nBut unfortunately the same evil spirit which had frustrated the former\r\ncampaigns broke out just at the moment when Turkey was so discomfited\r\nthat Russia, had she pushed her successes a little further, might have\r\ndictated a settlement upon her own terms. Envy at the progress of the\r\nRussian army was again exhibited in the ranks of the Austrians, who were\r\nsuffering under a contagious disease that helped in a still greater\r\ndegree to paralyse their activity. Unfortunately, too, the emperor\r\nCharles VI was afflicted with a dangerous illness; and his daughter,\r\nshrinking from the apprehensions of the future, was extremely desirous\r\nby any means to bring about a peace with Turkey. This disposition on\r\nthe part of Austria was gladly seized upon by the sultan; and, before\r\nthere was time to reconcile the unhappy differences that existed amongst\r\nthe allies, a treaty of peace was drawn up and signed between Austria\r\nand Turkey, on the 1st of September, 1739. By this inglorious treaty,\r\nAustria escaped from all further responsibility in the war; but she\r\npurchased the peace at so enormous a price that it is difficult to\r\ncomprehend the tortuous policy which led her to adopt so extraordinary\r\na measure. The war, in which she had embarked in the hope of securing\r\nterritorial advantages, had cost her a considerable expenditure in\r\ntroops and treasure; and she not only did not obtain an indemnity for\r\nthis outlay, nor acquire a single rood of ground by her participation in\r\nthe campaigns, but by the conditions of the treaty she was compelled to\r\nrelinquish Belgrade, her Hungarian rampart against the Turks, and all\r\nthose conquests which she had formerly obtained under the victorious flag\r\nof Prince Eugene.\r\n\r\nThis peace produced great dissatisfaction at St. Petersburg; for,\r\nalthough Austria reserved to herself the right of fulfilling her treaty\r\nwith Russia by succouring her in the field, it was not deemed prudent\r\nto prosecute a war single handed, which had been commenced with such a\r\nformidable display of power. The Turks, relieved from one antagonist,\r\nwere now the better enabled to resist the other; and the empress\r\nconceived that the wisest course she could pursue was to negotiate her\r\ndifferences with the sultan, to which proposal he was not unwilling to\r\naccede. A peace was consequently entered into between the belligerents\r\nwith such promptitude that it was concluded as early as the 18th of\r\nSeptember. The conditions of this treaty involved compromises on both\r\nsides. It was agreed that Azov and its surrounding territory should be\r\nevacuated and remain uncultivated, as a neutral boundary between the\r\ntwo empires; a similar arrangement was guaranteed respecting Kabarda,\r\nboth governments agreeing to retain in their hands a certain number of\r\nhostages from that province, for better security against an abuse of the\r\nstipulation. It was also settled that Russia should be at liberty to\r\nerect a fortress on the Don, and that the Porte should construct another\r\nin the Kuban. Some minor conquests of the Russians were surrendered:\r\nRussian fleets were not to be allowed to be kept in the sea of Azov\r\nor the Euxine; and in the latter sea the commerce of Russia was to be\r\nconducted only in Turkish bottoms.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Internal Administration_\r\n\r\nThe empress Anna, in thus suddenly concluding a peace with Turkey, was\r\nactuated by a still stronger motive than that which was supplied by the\r\ndesertion of Austria. She justly apprehended that Sweden, influenced by\r\nthe intrigues of France, who had now attained a decided ascendency in the\r\ncouncils of Stockholm, would endeavour to distract Russia in the north,\r\nwhile the main body of her army was occupied with the Porte on the south.\r\nSecret negotiations, carried on between the three powers, appeared to\r\nconfirm this suspicion. It was true that, at the conclusion of the last\r\nwar, Russia and Sweden had entered into an amnesty for twelve years,\r\nwhich was renewed for a similar period, on its expiration in the year\r\n1736. But this amnesty served only as a thin disguise for the rankling\r\nand bitter hostility which the Swedes entertained towards Russia. They\r\nhad not forgotten the protracted and ruinous struggle between Charles\r\nXII and Peter I, which convulsed the whole kingdom and exhausted its\r\nresources; nor the sacrifices which they were compelled to make at the\r\nPeace of Nystad. These feelings were assiduously cultivated by the French\r\ncourt, which found easy means of securing a strong party in the national\r\ncouncil, which in fact was paramount in Sweden, the king being completely\r\nunder its control. The empress, warned of this increasing desire for a\r\nrupture on the part of Sweden, was the more anxious to come to terms with\r\nTurkey, that she might be free to act in Finland and that neighbourhood,\r\nshould it become necessary.\r\n\r\nAnna was evidently guided in the whole course of her policy by the\r\nexample of Peter I, whom she adopted as her model. Fortunate in the\r\nchoice of at least two of her advisers--Ostermann in the council of\r\nstate, and Munich at the head of the army--she persevered in her attempts\r\nto complete those projects of improvement which her great predecessor had\r\nleft unfinished. The canal connected with the Lake of Ladoga, which was\r\ndesigned to facilitate the transport of provisions to St. Petersburg,\r\nwas brought to a close by her in the year 1738. She also fitted out an\r\nexpedition to sail from Kamchatka towards the north, for the purpose of\r\ndetermining whether Siberia was connected with North America.\r\n\r\nThe manufacture and commerce of Russia, too, commanded a large share of\r\nher attention. She instructed her ambassadors at foreign courts to make\r\nvigilant inquiries after the most skilful persons engaged in those trades\r\nin which Russia was most deficient; and by this means she was enabled\r\nto draw into her dominions a great number of artisans, particularly\r\nthose who were experienced in the production of such fabrics as silks\r\nand woollen stuffs. In furtherance of these views she entered into a\r\ntreaty of commerce with Great Britain, from which the industry of her\r\npeople derived a fresh and invigorating stimulus. It may be observed,\r\nalso, that she increased the numerical population by the return of the\r\nZaparogian Cossacks to their allegiance, shortly after the opening of\r\nthe campaign in the Crimea, which they had forfeited by the rebellion of\r\nMazeppa; and that she enlarged her territories by the acquisition of the\r\nprovince inhabited by the Kirghiz, a nomad tribe, on the Chinese borders.\r\nThis latter accession was of great importance, from the protection it\r\nafforded to the frontiers against the incursions to which they had\r\nhitherto been continually exposed: while it not only created a new trade\r\nwith the Kirghiz themselves, but gave greater freedom to the commercial\r\nintercourse with China, which had been constantly interrupted by these\r\nhostilities.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Biron the Favourite_\r\n\r\nThroughout her life Anna placed unreserved confidence in a favourite\r\nwho, rising from a humble station in society to the first place in the\r\ncouncils of his sovereign, at last aspired to the illicit possession of\r\nher affections. John Ernest Biron, the son of a gamekeeper in Courland,\r\nhappening to attract the attention of the duchess, was appointed her\r\nprivate secretary. From this post he was elevated to the more important\r\noffice of chamberlain; and even then it was rumoured that he stood higher\r\nin her grace’s favour than was consistent with the position which he\r\nnominally occupied. When the council elected his mistress to the imperial\r\nthrone, it was stipulated that Biron should not be suffered to accompany\r\nher into Russia; and one of the conditions of the capitulation restricted\r\nher from marrying, or choosing an heir, without the consent of the\r\ncouncil and senate. The empress, accepting the sovereignty under these\r\nlimitations, left Biron at Mittau, when she came to St. Petersburg; but\r\nshe had no sooner abrogated the stipulations within which her power was\r\nrestrained, than Biron appeared at court, was created a Russian count,\r\nappointed first lord of the bedchamber, and raised at once to the same\r\neminence which he had occupied before. Some years previously he had\r\nsucceeded in prevailing on the nobility of Courland to confer upon him\r\nthe title of duke; and when the Kettler family became extinct by the\r\ndeath of the duke of Courland, he procured that dignity from the hands of\r\nthe electors for himself and his heirs in perpetuity.\r\n\r\nThus glittering with honours, which at best were but surreptitiously\r\nobtained, he took upon himself at once in St. Petersburg the character\r\nof one who wielded an absolute authority. He was careful, however, not\r\nto offend Ostermann or Munich, because, possessing no abilities for\r\ngovernment himself, he was obliged to rely upon them as the instruments\r\nof his power. It was supposed that the Turkish war was undertaken at\r\nthe instigation of this daring man, for the purpose of keeping Munich\r\nat a distance from the capital--that officer having attained in a high\r\ndegree the confidence of the empress. By the most adroit measures Biron\r\ncontrived to remove from a familiar intercourse at court everybody who\r\nmight be likely to interfere with his ambitious designs. Apprehensive\r\nthat the empress, freed from the control of the council, might entertain\r\nthoughts of marriage, he assiduously limited all opportunities that could\r\nlead to such a result; and even attempted to prevent a union between\r\nthe princess Anna and Ulrich duke of Brunswick, the object of which had\r\nreference to the succession. In this scheme, however, the machinations\r\nof Biron were defeated, and the marriage was celebrated in the month of\r\nJuly, 1739. This event seriously interfered with the projects of the\r\nfavourite; but his ingenuity was not exerted in vain in the attempt to\r\nderive profit from circumstances which at first seemed so discouraging.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Death of Anna (1740 A.D.); the Succession_\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [1740 A.D.]]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: RUSSIAN PEASANT WOMAN]\r\n\r\nIn the August following, the duchess of Brunswick became the mother\r\nof a prince, who was immediately taken by the empress under her own\r\nguardianship and nominated to be her successor. This proceeding,\r\napparently founded upon some show of justice, was in reality the result\r\nof a deep-laid conspiracy. The empress was in a declining state of\r\nhealth, and it was felt that she could not long continue to exercise the\r\nsovereignty. In this state of things, it became necessary to provide\r\na successor by an authentic act that could not afterwards be called\r\ninto question. Biron aimed at the concentration of the imperial power\r\nin his own hands; but as an open declaration to that effect would have\r\nprovoked animosities dangerous to his safety, it was arranged that the\r\nyoung prince, then but a few weeks old, should be nominated to the\r\nthrone, and that Biron should be appointed regent during the minority\r\nof Ivan. Ostermann and Munich, relying upon the future gratitude of\r\nBiron, favoured this crafty design. Biron coquetted for a time with the\r\ndignities which he was solicited to accept; and pretended at last that,\r\nin undertaking the toils of the regency, he yielded to the importunities\r\nof others at the sacrifice of his own private wishes.\r\n\r\nThe extent of the power thus delegated to him was specified in the\r\nprovisions of the will of the empress, which ordained that he should\r\nbe the administrator of government until the emperor Ivan had attained\r\nhis seventeenth year; and that, should Ivan die before that time, Biron\r\nshould continue guardian to Ivan’s brethren, born after him, who should\r\nsucceed him on the throne; but that, should neither Ivan nor any of his\r\nbrethren survive, then Biron, with the concurrence of the state, should\r\nelect and confirm a new emperor as unlimited monarch. This was the final\r\ninjunction of the czarina, who died in 1740.[b]\r\n\r\n\r\n_A Russian Estimate of Anna and of Biron_\r\n\r\nContemporaneous writers are unanimous in asserting that, during her\r\nentire reign, Anna Ivanovna was not only under the influence, but, so\r\nto say, under the domination of her favourite. On the basis of such\r\nauthorities it therefore became customary to ascribe to Biron and the\r\nGermans who were grouped around him all the cruelties and coarseness\r\nthat characterised her reign. But if we subject this question to\r\na dispassionate and severe criticism it would appear that such an\r\naccusation of Biron--and in general of the Germans who governed with\r\nhim--has no firm foundation. It is impossible to ascribe all the\r\ncharacter of the reign to a German clique, because those Germans who were\r\nat the head of the government did not constitute a united corporation,\r\nbut each of them followed his own personal interests; they were envious\r\nof one another and at enmity each with the rest.\r\n\r\nBiron was a somewhat narrow-minded egotist, incapable of attracting any\r\ncircle around him; his power rested exclusively on the personal favour of\r\nthe empress; and therefore, as soon as Anna Ivanovna’s eyes were closed\r\nforever, her former favourite had no sure ground to go upon, and although\r\nhis deceased mistress had made his position secure yet he was not able to\r\nmaintain it a month without her. There is no contemporary indication that\r\nthe cruelties which signalised the reign of Anna emanated from Biron or\r\nthat they were accomplished at his initiative.\r\n\r\nMoreover, the cruelties and in general the harsh measures which\r\nsignalised the reign of Anna Ivanovna were not an exclusive\r\ncharacteristic of that epoch; they did not begin to make their appearance\r\nin Russia with her and did not cease with her. The administration of\r\nPeter the Great was signalised by persecutions even more cruel and\r\nharsh of everything opposed to the supreme power. The actions of Prince\r\nRomodanovski in accordance with the Preobrajenski edict were in no wise\r\nmilder or more humane than those of Andrew Ivanovitch Uskakov in the\r\nsecret chancery. On the other hand, similar features of cruelty and\r\ncontempt for human dignity are to be met with after Anna Ivanovna under\r\nElizabeth Petrovna. Therefore we do not hesitate to say that all that\r\ndisturbs us in the reign of Anna should not be ascribed to the empress\r\nherself, nor to her favourite, the duke of Courland, but to the whole age\r\nin which such occurrences took place. On the contrary, if we separate\r\nfrom that which belongs to the age what we may justly ascribe to the\r\nempress herself and the statesmen of her time, we come to a conclusion\r\nwhich is more to the advantage and credit of the government of the epoch\r\nthan to its condemnation. Many dispositions of the government of that\r\ntime in matters of interior policy were accomplished in the spirit of\r\nPeter the Great and it was not in vain that Anna Ivanovna confided the\r\naffairs of the state to the wise and gifted “fledgelings” of Peter.\r\nThanks to them, in many respects the reign of Anna may be called a\r\ncontinuation of the glorious reign of her great uncle: in general the\r\nlife of Russia moved forward and was not stagnant. The people of Russia\r\nsuffered from bad harvests during the reign, besides other various\r\naccidental calamities, as for instance fires and robbers; for all such\r\nevils, of course, the governments of the period cannot be blamed, and\r\nthere is no doubt that measures were taken to alleviate the distress of\r\nthe people.[c]\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE NOMINAL REIGN OF IVAN VI (1740-1741 A.D.)\r\n\r\nFor a short time after the death of Anna (1740) Biron maintained\r\nan autocratic rule, assuming the title of His Highness, Regent of\r\nthe Russian Empire. But finally the people, jealous of seeing the\r\nadministration of the imperial rule confided to the hands of a\r\nforeigner--and one too who, instead of exhibiting a sympathy in their\r\ninterests, treated them with the most flagrant tyranny--betrayed\r\nuniversal discontent at the new order of things. It was held to be\r\na direct act of injustice to debar the duke of Brunswick from the\r\nguardianship of his son; and a formidable party now rapidly sprang up,\r\nprepared to espouse the rights of that prince. The popular disaffection\r\nincreased on all sides; but Biron had established his spies in every\r\ndirection, and was unsparing in the punishments which he inflicted\r\nupon all those persons whom he had reason to believe inimical to his\r\ngovernment. The streets groaned with the cries of the victims of the\r\nknout; the people fled before him, or, in an agony of fear, prostrated\r\nthemselves upon the earth as he advanced; and the dungeons were filled\r\nwith the unhappy objects of his suspicions. It was calculated that,\r\nthroughout the period of his authority, including the reign of the\r\nempress Anna, no less than twenty thousand persons were exiled to Siberia.\r\n\r\nAt length the smothered flame broke out, and the demands in favour of\r\nDuke Ulrich took an affirmative shape. Count Munich, disappointed in his\r\nexpectations by the hypocritical Biron, warmly embarked on the other\r\nside; and, by still affecting to be the friend of the regent, he was\r\nenabled to render essential service in the revolution which was now\r\nswiftly encircling the walls of the palace. The confidence which the\r\nmilitary placed in Munich gave increased importance to his services; and,\r\nas he found that he had nothing to expect from the regent, he attached\r\nhimself zealously to Duke Ulrich in the anticipation that he would\r\nultimately be rewarded with the chief command of the army, which was the\r\nstation he had long eagerly desired to obtain.\r\n\r\nThe revolution which was thus organised was promptly accomplished. The\r\nregent was arrested in the middle of the night, in his house, by a\r\ndetachment of the guards; and the principal senators assembled in the\r\npalace before daybreak, and acknowledged the princess Anna as grand\r\nduchess of Russia, and guardian of her son the infant emperor. This\r\nproceeding was the work of a few hours. Biron was at first confined\r\nin the castle of Schlüsselburg, whence he was removed as a prisoner\r\nand brought to trial for obtaining the regency by improper means, for\r\nsquandering the imperial treasures, for treating with contumely the\r\nparents of the emperor, and for violating the statutes and ordinances\r\nso as to throw the empire into confusion. For these capital offences\r\nhe was condemned to death; but his sentence was mitigated to perpetual\r\nbanishment to the deserts of Siberia, where, in addition to the ordinary\r\nmiseries of that forlorn region, he was compelled to associate in the\r\nlabours of the numerous wretches whom he had himself condemned to the\r\nsame fate. [He was, however, set at liberty by Peter III, and Catherine\r\nII ultimately restored to him the duchy of Courland.]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Anna of Brunswick Assumes the Regency (1740 A.D.)_\r\n\r\nThe regency of the princess Anna was slightly perplexed at its opening,\r\nby the importunate demands of Munich to be placed at the head of the\r\narmy--a post which Duke Ulrich appropriated to himself, and peremptorily\r\nrefused to relinquish. As a compensation, however, to Munich, he removed\r\nOstermann, and appointed his rival in his place as first minister of the\r\ngovernment. Munich did not long hold this office: failing to accomplish\r\na course of policy which he urged upon the regent, he tendered his\r\nresignation, which was unexpectedly accepted. Frustrated in his hopes,\r\nhe lingered in St. Petersburg, anticipating that he would be recalled;\r\nbut the period of his utility was past, and his anticipations were\r\ndisappointed. The ground of his retirement involved a serious change in\r\nthe foreign policy of the empire. Frederick II had just ascended the\r\nthrone of Prussia, and, regarding with jealousy the alliance that had\r\nbeen formed between the courts of St. Petersburg and Vienna, endeavoured\r\nto accomplish a union with Russia through the regency of Munich, whose\r\nantipathy to Austria was notorious. Frederick did not find it very\r\ndifficult to work upon the vanity and prejudices of the minister, who\r\nwas easily brought to prevail upon the regent to enter into a defensive\r\ntreaty with the cabinet of Berlin; both parties mutually binding\r\nthemselves to furnish assistance, as occasion might require, to the\r\nextent of twelve thousand men. In consenting to this treaty, the regent\r\nmentally resolved to fulfil the stipulation it enjoined, only so long\r\nas Prussia should be at peace with Austria. An occasion soon offered\r\nwhich obliged her to act upon this secret resolution, Frederick having\r\nsignified his intention of taking possession of Silesia as a part of the\r\ninheritance of Maria Theresa. In consequence of this proceeding, a new\r\nalliance was formed with Austria at the commencement of the year 1741, by\r\nwhich a fresh engagement to furnish auxiliaries was entered into. Munich\r\nin vain remonstrated against this measure; and at last, finding his\r\ninfluence at an end, he solicited permission to resign, which was granted\r\nto him at once. Notwithstanding the disposition thus manifested on the\r\npart of Russia, she did not take any part in the war between Prussia and\r\nAustria; particularly as the king of Poland and the elector of Saxony,\r\nwho also raised pretensions to the patrimony of Theresa, protested\r\nagainst the progress of the Russian troops through Poland; Sweden at the\r\nsame time threatening the empire on the borders of Finland.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sweden Renews the War_\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [1741 A.D.]]\r\n\r\nThe Swedes had long looked anxiously for an excuse to make war against\r\nRussia; and now that the government of that empire was, to a certain\r\ndegree, unpopular, and likely from that circumstance to undergo an\r\nalteration, a favourable opportunity appeared to present itself for\r\nexecuting a project so gratifying to the whole nation. The ambassador\r\nof France at the court of Stockholm encouraged the council to prosecute\r\nthis war; while the French minister at St. Petersburg demonstrated its\r\nfacility by representing in strong colours the weakness and instability\r\nof the new administration. The Swedes, flattered by the hopes in which\r\nthey were led to indulge, already calculated with certainty upon the\r\nresults of the campaign; and the diet at Stockholm were so sanguine of\r\nsuccess that they actually drew up no less than three sets of articles\r\ncontaining the conditions which they intended to dictate at the\r\nconclusion of the war, when they were assured Russia would be compelled\r\nto submit to any terms they might propose. By these articles, they made\r\nprovision for the resumption of all the provinces that had been ceded to\r\nRussia by the Treaty of Nystad; and prepared arrangements, in the event\r\nof these not being quite so successful as they expected, by which certain\r\nterms, less humiliating but exceedingly extravagant, were to be forced\r\nupon their adversary. It was decided, at all events, that, in any case,\r\nRussia should surrender Karelia, Ingermanland, and Livonia; that she\r\nshould not be permitted to keep a single ship on the Livonia or Esthonian\r\ncoasts; and that she should be compelled to grant the free exportation of\r\ncorn.\r\n\r\nThese plans of aggrandisement were deliberately settled by the diet,\r\nbefore any preparations were made for their execution. The Swedes were\r\nzealous enough in their desire to wrest from Russia her conquered\r\nterritories; but they were lamentably deficient in the means by which\r\nthat desire was to be accomplished. Their fleet was not seaworthy;\r\nand the army, brave to a proverb, was insufficiently furnished with\r\nprovisions, and so destitute of skilful commanders that if it had\r\nachieved a victory it must have been by some miracle of good fortune,\r\nand not by its own prowess. The generals Levenhaupt and Buddembrock were\r\nthe most strenuous advocates of the war; yet, although its conduct was\r\ncommitted to their own hands, the sequel proved that the enterprise was\r\nas rashly conceived as it was badly conducted.\r\n\r\nRussia was the first in the field; and General Lacy, advancing on the\r\nSwedes in August, 1741, before they had time to organise their forces,\r\nobtained a signal victory over them near Vilmanstrand. This fortress\r\nimmediately surrendered to the Russians; but the Swedes collected in such\r\nsuperior numbers that no further progress was made by Lacy throughout the\r\nrest of the campaign.\r\n\r\nWhen Sweden entered upon this ill-advised war, she acted under a\r\nconviction that serious discontents prevailed in Russia against the\r\nregency of the duchess of Brunswick. The sudden changes, succeeding\r\neach other with marvellous rapidity, that had taken place in the\r\nimperial government, justified, in some measure, the supposition that\r\nthe present regency was as much exposed to revolution as the preceding\r\nadministrations. The question of the succession had been treated so\r\nvaguely, and had been subjected to such fluctuating decisions, that it\r\nwas believed some new theory would be set up to annul the last election,\r\nas others had been annulled before. There was no doubt that the division\r\nof parties in Russia afforded a reasonable ground for anticipating a\r\nconvulsion. The supreme power had latterly become the prize for which\r\nbase and ambitious men, without hereditary pretensions and destitute of\r\npersonal merit, had struggled with various degrees of success. There was\r\nevidently no settled principle of inheritance; and even the dangerous\r\nprinciple sanctioned by the example of Peter the Great, which gave to one\r\nunlimited sovereign the right of choosing another to succeed him, was\r\nacted upon capriciously, and appealed to or overruled as it happened to\r\nsuit the exigency of the occasion.\r\n\r\nThe brief reigns of Catherine, of Peter, and of Anna, remarkable as they\r\nwere for the confusion to which they led in the attempts to settle the\r\ncrown, for the vicissitudes which they drew down upon persons who had\r\npreviously enjoyed uninterrupted prosperity, and for the factious views\r\nwhich they extracted and condensed into conspiracies, might be referred\r\nto as furnishing the probabilities of the future, and confirming the\r\nhopes of those who desired, above all things, to see Russia once more\r\nbroken up by civil commotions. The antipathy which existed against\r\nforeigners, and the objections of the old aristocracy to those European\r\nreforms that had been from time to time forced upon the people, were\r\nwell known to the courts of Stockholm and Paris. The vulnerable point\r\nin the domestic concerns of the empire was laid bare; and Sweden, who\r\nanticipated a revolution from some cause or other, without being able\r\nto predicate from what precise ground of discontent it would spring,\r\nresolved, at all events, to expose to the Russians the permanent evil of\r\ntheir condition, leaving it to work its effects as it might. With this\r\nview she issued a manifesto, containing the following artful reasons,\r\nwhich were designed to draw with her the sympathies of the Russian\r\npopulation.\r\n\r\n“The sole intention on the part of Sweden,” observed the manifesto, “is\r\nto defend herself by arms against the oppressions exercised against\r\nher by the arrogant foreigners, the ministers of the Russian court;\r\nand at the same time to deliver the Russian nation from the yoke which\r\nthese ministers have imposed on it, by assisting the Russians to regain\r\ntheir right of electing for themselves a lawful ruler.” The foreigners\r\nparticularly pointed at in this manifesto were Munich and Ostermann. The\r\nallusion, towards the close, of the design of Sweden to deliver Russia\r\nfrom the yoke of those ministers and to assist her in her right of\r\nelecting a lawful ruler, touched upon topics which were well calculated\r\nto disturb the minds of the people, and to suggest to them notions\r\nof independence which they had been hitherto prevented by coercive\r\ninstitutions from entertaining. But there was either a stolid apathy on\r\nthe part of the Russians, an indifference to or ignorance of the nature\r\nof liberty, or a national jealousy at the interference of other countries\r\nin their affairs, which rendered this ingenious and inflammatory document\r\nperfectly harmless. It was disseminated and forgotten; but, although\r\nSweden could not create a revolution in Russia, there were elements of\r\ndiscord within which rendered revolution inevitable.\r\n\r\nThe assertion of the right of the sovereign to nominate his successor was\r\nproductive of inconvenience in a variety of ways: (1) as it constantly\r\nbrought the new monarch into collision with the authorities, who were\r\nthus deprived of the privilege of election; (2) as it was almost certain\r\nto dissatisfy some party, and to produce continual feuds; (3) as it\r\nled to dissensions and attempts to vindicate the ancient principle,\r\nwhenever the sovereign, as we have seen, happened to die intestate;\r\nand (4) as it was calculated to perpetuate in particular families the\r\ninheritance of the patronage and the power of government. But the chief\r\ndanger arose from the fatal precedent of its interruption, which was\r\nseized upon with avidity as a justification, on all future changes, of\r\nthose revolutions which so frequently originated within the walls of the\r\npalace. Alterations had now followed each other so quickly in the persons\r\nto whom the administration of the government was committed, and they were\r\nconceived so rapidly, and executed with such suddenness and decision,\r\nthat it was no longer surprising to find the imperial authority vested in\r\nthe morning in different hands from those which exercised it the night\r\nbefore.\r\n\r\nThese bold transactions were, of course, founded upon some plausible\r\npretext--the unpopularity of the late ruler, the more authentic claims\r\nof the new, the support of the army, or, perhaps, the rare argument of\r\nthe national will, which it would be mockery to designate public opinion.\r\nThe overthrow of Biron was effected by a combination of circumstances:\r\nthe hatred in which he was universally held, his cruelty and rapacity,\r\nthe obscurity of his origin, and the fact that he was an alien by birth.\r\nBut the last of these objections lay with almost equal force against\r\nthe young emperor Ivan, and might be employed with still greater truth\r\nagainst his father, the duke of Brunswick, who, as husband of the regent,\r\nexercised considerable influence at court. A stronger motive than this\r\nwas not required to inflame the prejudices of a powerful section of the\r\nnobility, and to yield a satisfactory apology for removing the regent and\r\nher son, who was not considered a true Russian, from power. The project\r\nwas not slow in arriving at maturity; and the term of authority permitted\r\nto the guardian of Ivan was, all circumstances considered, of little more\r\nduration than that extended to Biron, who held his perilous elevation\r\nonly two and twenty days.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Successful Conspiracy against the Regent_\r\n\r\nThese designs against the throne were greatly facilitated by the\r\nstrange conduct of the princess Anna and her husband. Since they had\r\nattained their wishes in the government, their behaviour towards each\r\nother had undergone a most remarkable change. Harmony and confidence\r\nseemed to have ceased between them; and, no longer acting in concert,\r\nbut, on the contrary, opposing each other by conflicting views, the\r\naffairs of the state unavoidably fell into perplexity and confusion.\r\nThe rivalry that had been produced between Ostermann and Munich in\r\nconsequence of the favour shown, in the first instance, by the duke to\r\nthe latter, contributed to increase that disagreement in action which\r\nwas imperceptibly dividing the government into two parties. Ostermann,\r\nfinding himself displaced to make way for Munich, attached himself still\r\nmore closely to the duke, for the purpose of supplanting his rival upon\r\nthe first opportunity; while Munich, on the other hand, smarting under\r\nthe mortification he endured by the duke’s repeated refusal of the\r\noffice he solicited, sought to ingratiate himself in the good opinion\r\nof the regent. The consequence of this spirit of opposition, fed by the\r\njealousies of those able ministers, was the daily counteraction by one\r\nparty of the measures projected by the other.\r\n\r\nThe regent was a woman of serene temper and lenient disposition; she\r\nregarded severity with aversion, and always resorted to the prerogative\r\nof mercy where it was possible she could do so consistently with justice:\r\nbut her desires were so completely thwarted by Ostermann that the public\r\nresults of the administration bore a very different character from that\r\nby which they would have been distinguished had her own opinions been\r\nallowed their proper weight. Perhaps it was to this undercurrent of\r\nresistance that the indifference concerning the government into which she\r\nfell ought to be attributed. But, to whatever cause it might be referred,\r\nshe gradually neglected the duties of her station, and suffered them to\r\nbe discharged at hazard by the advisers of the duke. Totally estranging\r\nherself from her husband, she retired for weeks together from public\r\naffairs, and shut herself up with a Countess Mengden, who obtained so\r\ngreat an ascendency over her mind as to withdraw her attention almost\r\nwholly from the responsibility of her position. This circumstance\r\nproduced considerable dissatisfaction, and heightened the antipathy\r\nwith which the people regarded the German party that was now growing\r\nup at court. The aversion entertained towards foreigners now broke out\r\nwith more violence than ever. It seemed as if the administration of\r\naffairs had completely passed out of the hands of the Russians. The\r\nconvention that had been formed on the demise of Peter II, by which the\r\nsupreme authority was vested in the council, which was composed almost\r\nexclusively of members of native families, would have had indirectly the\r\neffect of excluding strangers from the government; but the evils with\r\nwhich it was pregnant, and its immediate interference with the privileges\r\nof the empress, led to its abrogation. The ascendency of foreigners was\r\nthen resumed with greater force than ever. Biron the insolent guardian,\r\nOstermann the experienced politician, and Munich the able commander rose\r\nto the summit and swayed the destinies of the empire.\r\n\r\nNor did Ivan himself possess a much better claim to be considered as a\r\nRussian. He was but a remote descendant of the house of Romanov; his\r\nfather was a German prince, his mother the daughter of a German prince;\r\nand the only member of the imperial house to whom he could refer his\r\nlineal descent was his grandfather Ivan, stepbrother to Peter I. The\r\nfamily, therefore, that occupied the throne, was almost exclusively of\r\nGerman blood, which was rendered still more repugnant to the people by\r\nthe fact that all the most important offices under government were filled\r\nby foreigners. There was in these circumstances, and in the desire to\r\narrest finally the influence of strangers--which appeared to progress\r\nwith increasing certainty in each successive reign--a sufficient ground\r\nfor protest; and the extraordinary indolence of the regent, her utter\r\nneglect of state affairs, her discouragement of Russian customs, and her\r\nlavish patronage of her immediate adherents, who were all obnoxious to\r\nthe people, furnished the ready pretext upon which a plot was formed to\r\nexpel her from the throne.\r\n\r\nThe princess Elizabeth, daughter of Peter I, residing at St. Petersburg,\r\nwas the person in favour of whose claims this conspiracy was got up.\r\nBy birth, she was closer to the throne than either the young emperor\r\nor the regent; and the habits of her life were much more congenial to\r\nthe feelings of the country. She might have preferred her pretensions\r\non the death of Peter II, when there was a strong probability that they\r\nwould have commanded the suffrages of the council; but at that time she\r\nexpressed no desire to enter upon the cares of sovereignty, choosing\r\nrather to cultivate the repose of a retired and tranquil life. Throughout\r\nthe reign of the empress Anna she observed the same quiet course, kept\r\naloof from politics, and avoiding, as much as possible, all intercourse\r\nwith the great men or distinguished families at court. Her conduct was\r\nso entirely free from suspicion that she enjoyed the closest intimacy\r\nwith the empress, who, believing that the princess was averse to the\r\ntoils of power, bestowed her full confidence upon her; and even Biron,\r\nwho distrusted almost everyone about him, never contemplated any measure\r\nto her prejudice. She enjoyed the immunities of a private person; never\r\nmade any display of her rank in public; and was in truth, as she was\r\nin appearance, without a party in the country. The only exception to\r\nthe privacy of her life was the attachment she showed for the soldiery,\r\nparticularly the guards; which she did not hesitate to exhibit by\r\nfrequently standing sponsor for their children.\r\n\r\nYet, although her conduct was so exempt from reproach, the Dolgoruki were\r\naccused of an intention of placing her upon the throne--an intention\r\nwhich they might have entertained without her knowledge or sanction; for\r\nthere was sometimes as much violence committed in forcing the dignity\r\nupon unwilling shoulders as in deposing the possessor. That aspiring\r\nfamily fell under the displeasure of Biron, and its members were put to\r\nthe torture towards the close of the year 1739; when they confessed that\r\nthey had planned an insurrection, the purpose of which was to carry off\r\nthe empress, the princess Anna, and her husband, to expel the Germans\r\nfrom Russia, to proclaim Elizabeth empress, and to bring about a marriage\r\nbetween her and one of the Nariskins. This confession might be true, or\r\nit might have been wrung from the accused by torture, which, in those\r\ntimes, was too often persuasively employed to make its victims confess\r\nmore than the truth; but it was satisfactory for the ends of Biron, who,\r\nproceeding to capital punishment at once, broke one of the victims on the\r\nwheel, decapitated three others, and sentenced two more to a dungeon for\r\nlife.\r\n\r\nThere is no reason to believe that Elizabeth contemplated any designs\r\nupon the throne during the reign of the empress Anna, or that the\r\nsimplicity of her general conduct was assumed as a disguise for secret\r\nintrigues. The project seems to have occurred to her for the first time,\r\nwhen she saw an infant emperor consigned to the regency of a foreigner;\r\nit was probably strengthened afterwards, when the guardianship of the\r\nchild was transferred to its parents, one of whom was a German by birth,\r\nand the other by descent; and it reached its maturity, when she heard\r\nit reported currently that the regent intended to have herself declared\r\nempress on her birthday in the following December, 1741, and to establish\r\nthe succession in the line of her daughters. This intelligence, which\r\nevery day obtained fresh credit at court, imparted a new aspect to the\r\nquestion. It was no longer to be considered a choice between lineal and\r\nindirect descendants of the house of Romanov, but between a sovereign who\r\nshould be chosen by the electors and one who was resolved to usurp by\r\nforce what she could not legitimately obtain.\r\n\r\nThe discontent of the people, the inconsistent bearing of the regent,\r\nand the favourable disposition for a change which began to be developed\r\nin influential quarters, seemed to sanction the act of revolution, and\r\nto invoke Elizabeth from her retirement to fulfil its ends. Personally,\r\nshe stood alone; she had never drawn around her any powerful friends;\r\nshe had never mixed in the court feuds; and her whole reliance was upon\r\nthe temper and accidents of the time. But it was not forgotten in her\r\ncalculations that the individual who is the representative of a principle\r\nacquires at once all the power which the cause he espouses can confer,\r\nand that he is sure to be sustained by a party for the promotion of their\r\nown objects, although he might be destitute of support in the attempt to\r\nadvance his own.\r\n\r\nLestocq, the physician and favourite of the princess, was the mainspring\r\nof the plot. It was by his advice that the enterprise was undertaken,\r\nand it was almost solely by his perseverance that it was prosecuted. He\r\nfirst addressed himself to the guards, who were individually devoted to\r\nthe princess. The earliest confidants of his schemes were Grünstein, a\r\nbroken merchant, who was then a corporal in the Preobrajenski guards,\r\nand Schwartz, a trumpeter. Through the agency of these persons, to whom\r\nhe promised large rewards, Lestocq succeeded in gaining over to his\r\nviews a strong party of the soldiery. M. de la Chetardie, the French\r\nambassador resident at St. Petersburg, readily engaged in the conspiracy,\r\nacting, no doubt, under the sanction of his court, whose policy it was to\r\nconvulse the Russian government by any means in its power, in the hope\r\nof ultimately effecting a disunion between that cabinet and the Austrian\r\nemperor. From that minister Lestocq procured the sums of money that were\r\nnecessary to carry forward his plans, which now proceeded with rapidity.\r\n\r\nBut Elizabeth, who had entered into the project with reluctance, regarded\r\nits progress with fear, and was as anxious to postpone the catastrophe as\r\nLestocq was eager for its accomplishment. This produced delays which were\r\nnearly fatal. The soldiers, entrusted with a secret of too much magnitude\r\nfor persons in their condition, could not long preserve the confidence\r\nthat was reposed in them; and at last the design began to be rumoured\r\nabroad. It even reached the ears of the regent, who, possessed by some\r\nunaccountable infatuation, treated it with the utmost carelessness. She\r\neither did not believe in its truth, or lulled herself into security\r\nby depending upon the fidelity of her friends. Unmoved by the danger\r\nthat threatened her, she concealed from her husband the information she\r\nhad received; for which, when it was too late to retrace her steps, he\r\nafterwards severely censured her. Ostermann, who was early made aware of\r\nthe proceedings of the conspirators, warned the regent of her danger,\r\nand entreated her to take some decisive measures to avert it: and the\r\nBritish ambassador, detecting, probably, the insidious hand of France,\r\npredicted her destruction in vain. Her facile nature still lingered\r\ninactive, until at last she received an anonymous letter, in which she\r\nwas strongly admonished of the perils by which she was surrounded. A\r\nmore energetic mind would have acted unhesitatingly upon these repeated\r\nproofs of the approaching insurrection; but Anna, still clinging to the\r\nside of mercy, instead of seizing upon the ringleaders, who were known\r\nto her, and quieting at once the apprehensions of her advisers, read the\r\nwhole contents of the letter in open court in the presence of Elizabeth,\r\nand stated the nature of the reports that had reached her. Elizabeth, of\r\ncourse, protested her ignorance of the whole business, burst into a flood\r\nof tears, and asserted her innocence with such a show of sincerity that\r\nthe regent was perfectly satisfied, and took no further notice of the\r\nmatter.\r\n\r\nThis occurred on the 4th of December, 1741. Lestocq had previously\r\nappointed the day of the consecration of the waters, the 6th of January,\r\n1742, for Elizabeth to make her public appearance at the head of the\r\nguards, to issue declarations setting forth her claims upon the throne,\r\nand to cause herself to be proclaimed. But the proceeding that had\r\ntaken place in the court determined him to hasten his plans. Now that\r\nthe vigilance of the court was awakened, he knew that his motions would\r\nbe watched, and that the affair did not admit of any further delay. He\r\napplied himself, accordingly, with redoubled vigilance, to the business\r\nof collecting and organising the partisans of the princess; continued to\r\nbribe them with French gold; and, when everything was prepared, he again\r\nimpressed upon his mistress the urgent necessity of decision. He pointed\r\nout to her that the guards, upon whose assistance she chiefly relied,\r\nwere under orders to march for Sweden, and that in a short time all would\r\nbe lost. She was still, however, timid and doubtful of the result, when\r\nthe artful Lestocq drew a card from his pocket, which represented her\r\non one side in the habit of a nun, and on the other with a crown upon\r\nher head--asking her which fate she preferred; adding that the choice\r\ndepended upon herself, and upon the promptitude with which she employed\r\nthe passing moment. This argument succeeded; she consented to place\r\nherself in his hands; and, remembering the success that had attended the\r\nmidnight revolution that consigned Biron to banishment, he appointed\r\nthe following night, the 5th of December, for the execution of his\r\nplan--undertaking the principal part himself, in the hope of the honours\r\nthat were to be heaped upon him in the event of success.\r\n\r\nWhen the hour arrived Elizabeth again betrayed irresolution, but\r\nLestocq overcame her fears; and after having made a solemn vow before\r\nthe crucifix that no blood should be shed in the attempt, she put on\r\nthe order of St. Catherine, and placing herself in a sledge, attended\r\nby Lestocq and her chamberlain, she drove to the barracks of the\r\nPreobrajenski guards. When she arrived at this point, she advanced\r\ntowards the soldiers on foot, holding the cross in her hand; and,\r\naddressing them in a speech of some length, justified the grounds on\r\nwhich she advanced her claims to the throne; reminded them that she was\r\nthe daughter of Peter the Great; that she had been illegally deprived of\r\nthe succession; that a foreign child wielded the imperial sceptre; and\r\nthat foreigners were advanced, to the exclusion of native Russians, to\r\nthe highest offices in the state. A considerable number of the guards\r\nhad been previously prepared for this proceeding by bribes and promises,\r\nand inflammatory liquors were distributed amongst them to heighten their\r\nzeal. With the exception of a few, who would not violate their duty and\r\nwho were, in consequence, manacled by the remainder, the whole body\r\nresponded to the address with enthusiasm.\r\n\r\nThey now proceeded to the palace of the emperor and his parents, pressing\r\ninto their train everybody they met on the way, to prevent their object\r\nfrom being betrayed; and, forcing the sentries at the gates, obtained\r\neasy admittance to the sleeping apartments of the regent and the duke,\r\nwhom they dragged, unceremoniously, and without affording them time to\r\ndress, out of their beds, and conveyed to the palace of Elizabeth, where\r\nthey confined them under a strong guard. The infant Ivan, unconscious\r\nof the misery that awaited him, was enjoying a gentle slumber during\r\nthis scene of violence; and when he awoke he was carried, in a similar\r\nmanner, to the place where his unhappy parents were immured. On the same\r\nnight the principal persons connected with the government were seized in\r\nthe same way, and thrown into prison. Amongst them were Lewis Ernest of\r\nBrunswick, the brother of the duke, Ostermann, and Munich.\r\n\r\nThis revolution was as rapid and complete as that which deprived Biron\r\nof the regency, and was effected by a similar stealthy proceeding in the\r\nsilence of the night. Early on the following morning, the inhabitants\r\nwere called upon to take the oath of fealty to Elizabeth. But they were\r\naccustomed to these sudden movements in the palace; and before the day\r\nwas concluded the shouts of the intoxicated soldiery announced that\r\nthe people had confirmed, by the usual attestation of allegiance, the\r\nauthority of the empress.[49] A manifesto was immediately issued, which\r\ncontained the following statement:\r\n\r\nThe empress Anna having nominated the grandson of her sister, a child\r\nborn into the world only a few weeks before the empress’ death, as\r\nsuccessor to the throne; during the minority of whom various persons\r\nhad conducted the administration of the empire in a manner highly\r\niniquitous, whence disturbances had arisen both within the country and\r\nout of it, and probably in time still greater might arise; therefore\r\nall the faithful subjects of Elizabeth, both in spiritual and temporal\r\nstations, particularly the regiments of the life-guards, had unanimously\r\ninvited her, for the prevention of all the mischievous consequences to be\r\napprehended, to take possession of the throne of her father as nearest by\r\nright of birth; and that she had accordingly resolved to yield to this\r\nuniversal request of her faithful subjects, by taking possession of her\r\ninheritance derived from her parents, the emperor Peter I and the empress\r\nCatherine.\r\n\r\nShortly after this another manifesto appeared, in which Elizabeth\r\ngrounded her legitimacy on the will of Catherine I. As the statements\r\nin this document respecting the right of inheritance are singular in\r\nthemselves, and as they illustrate in a very remarkable degree the\r\nirregularity with which the question of the succession was suffered to\r\nbe treated, the passage touching upon those points appears to be worthy\r\nof preservation. It will be seen, upon reference to previous facts, that\r\nthese statements are highly coloured to suit the demands of the occasion.\r\nAfter some preliminaries, the manifesto proceeds to observe, that on the\r\ndemise of Peter II, whom she (Elizabeth) ought to have succeeded, Anna\r\nwas elected through the machinations of Ostermann; and afterwards, when\r\nthe sovereign was attacked by a mortal distemper, the same Ostermann\r\nappointed as successor the son of Prince Antony Ulrich of Brunswick and\r\nthe princess of Mecklenburg, a child only two months old, who had not the\r\nslightest claim by inheritance to the Russian throne; and, not content\r\nwith this, he added, to the prejudice of Elizabeth, that after Ivan’s\r\ndeath the princes afterwards born of the said prince of Brunswick and the\r\nprincess of Mecklenburg should succeed to the Russian throne; whereas\r\neven the parents themselves had not the slightest right to that throne.\r\nThat Ivan was, therefore, by the machinations of Ostermann and Munich,\r\nconfirmed emperor in October, 1740; and because the several regiments\r\nof guards, as well as the marching regiments, were under the command of\r\nMunich and the father of Ivan, and consequently the whole force of the\r\nempire was in the hands of those two persons, the subjects were compelled\r\nto take the oath of allegiance to Ivan. That Antony Ulrich and his spouse\r\nhad afterwards broken this ordinance, to which they themselves had sworn;\r\nhad forcibly seized upon the administration of the empire; and Anna had\r\nresolved, even in the lifetime of her son Ivan, to place herself upon\r\nthe throne as empress. That, in order, then, to prevent all dangerous\r\nconsequences from these proceedings, Elizabeth had ascended the throne,\r\nand of her own imperial grace had ordered the princess with her son and\r\ndaughter to set out for their native country.\r\n\r\nSuch were the arguments upon which Elizabeth attempted to justify her\r\nseizure of the throne. With what sincerity she fulfilled the act of grace\r\ntowards the regent and her family, expressed in the last sentence, will\r\nbe seen hereafter.\r\n\r\n\r\nELIZABETH PETROVNA (1741-1762 A.D.)\r\n\r\nThe revolution which elevated Elizabeth to the throne and the\r\ncircumstances which preceded that elevation were in every respect\r\nremarkable. She had no claim to the dignity, either by birth or by the\r\nregulation in regard to the succession introduced by the innovating\r\nPeter. Elizabeth was the younger daughter of Peter: Anna, who had been\r\nmarried to the duke of Holstein, was the elder; and though this princess\r\nwas dead, she left a son, the representative of her rights, who, as\r\nwe shall hereafter perceive, did ultimately reign as Peter III. The\r\nright of primogeniture, indeed, had, in the regulation to which we have\r\nalluded, been set aside, and the choice, pure and simple, of the reigning\r\npotentate substituted; but the infant Peter had the additional claim\r\nof being expressly indicated in the will of Catherine I. These claims,\r\nhowever, had been utterly disregarded when Anna, duchess of Courland and\r\ndaughter of Ivan, brother of Peter I, had been raised by a faction to the\r\nthrone. On the death of this empress without issue, Peter, as we have\r\nseen, was again overlooked, through the ambition rather of an individual\r\nthan of a faction--the bloodthirsty Biron.\r\n\r\nIvan, the son of Anna, had been preferred to his mother, who had been\r\nmarried to Prince Antony Ulrich of Brunswick; and no doubt could be\r\nentertained that the object of Biron, in prevailing on the empress to\r\nnominate the child, was to retain the supreme power in his own hands\r\nas regent. We have seen by what means his ruin was effected; what\r\ncircumstances accompanied the regency of the duchess Anna, mother of the\r\nyouthful emperor; and how, by a similar revolution, Anna herself was\r\nreplaced by the princess Elizabeth.\r\n\r\nThat Ivan had no other right to the throne than that conferred\r\nby the will of the empress Anna, was one of the pretexts which\r\nElizabeth employed to prove the validity of her own title. That will,\r\nin the manifesto published three days after the revolution, was\r\ninsinuated--probably with great truth--to have been irregularly obtained;\r\nbut in either case it was of no validity, since the right of Elizabeth\r\nwas asserted to be superior even to that of the former empress. But the\r\ninstrument was a tissue of sophistry. Though she had been placed on the\r\nthrone by about three hundred soldiers, she did not hesitate to affirm\r\nthat the revolution had been effected at the demand of all her subjects.\r\nIn ostentatiously displaying her clemency, in proclaiming that she had\r\nsent back the parents of Ivan to their own country, with all the honours\r\ndue to their station, she was equally insincere. Both passed their\r\nlives in captivity, and were transferred from one fortress to another,\r\naccording to her caprice or jealousy. Until his eighth year Ivan was\r\npermitted to remain with them; but, apprehensive lest his mind should be\r\ntaught ambition, he was consigned to solitary confinement first in the\r\nfortress of Oranienburg, next in that of Schlüsselburg. In one respect\r\nhis fate was worse than that of his parents: they died in the course of\r\nnature[50]; he, as we shall hereafter perceive, perished by violence.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ELIZABETH PETROVNA\r\n\r\n(1709-1762)]\r\n\r\nOne of Elizabeth’s first cares was to punish the men who had, during\r\nthe former reigns, kept her from the throne--those especially who had\r\nassisted the regent Anna in overturning the power of Biron, and had\r\ninstigated her afterwards to seize the throne. All were condemned to\r\ndeath; but the new empress was not a woman of blood, and the sentence was\r\ncommuted into perpetual banishment. Ostermann, Munich, Golovkin, Mengden,\r\nLövenwold, driven from a power scarcely less than supreme and from riches\r\nalmost inexhaustible, were forced to earn their own subsistence in the\r\nwilds of Siberia. Munich opened a school. The hand which had conquered\r\nthe Turks, which had given a king to Poland, was employed in tracing\r\nmathematical figures for children.\r\n\r\nIf Elizabeth could punish, she could also reward. The surgeon, Lestocq,\r\nwas made head physician of the court, president of the college of the\r\nfaculty, and privy councillor, with a magnificent income. The company\r\nof grenadiers who had raised her to the throne were all declared noble;\r\nand the common soldiers ranked in future as lieutenants. But under a\r\ndespotic government there is little security for the great, least of all\r\nfor those whom capricious favour has exalted. Presuming on his services,\r\nthe ambition of Lestocq urged him to demand higher preferment, and he had\r\nthe mortification to be refused. Nor was this all: by his arrogance he\r\noffended the most powerful favourites of Elizabeth, especially the grand\r\nchancellor Bestuzhev, who had been the minister of Anna; and, in seven\r\nyears after the revolution, he was exiled to a fortress in the government\r\nof Archangel. Exile, in short, was perpetual in this reign. The empress\r\nvowed that no culprit should suffer death; but death would often have\r\nbeen preferable to the punishments which were inflicted. Torture, the\r\nknout, slitting of the tongue, and other chastisements--so cruel that the\r\nsufferer frequently died in consequence--were not spared even females.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [1743 A.D.]]\r\n\r\nSoon after her accession a conspiracy was discovered, the object of\r\nwhich was the restoration of young Ivan. The conspirators, who were\r\nencouraged by a foreign minister, were seized, severely chastised,\r\nand sent into exile. Among them was a court beauty, whose charms had\r\nlong given umbrage to the czarina, and we may easily conceive that the\r\nrevenge was doubly sweet which could at once destroy the rebel and the\r\nrival. But the number of these victims was small, compared with that\r\nwhich was consigned to unknown dungeons, and doomed to pass the rest of\r\nlife in hopeless despondency. With all her humanity, Elizabeth suffered\r\nthat most inquisitorial court, the secret chancery, to subsist; and the\r\ndenunciations which were laid before it were received as implicitly as\r\nthe clearest evidence in other tribunals.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Foreign Affairs (1743-1757 A.D.)_\r\n\r\nIn her foreign policy this empress seems scarcely to have had an object.\r\nAverse to business, and fond of pleasure, she allowed her ministers,\r\nespecially Bestuzhev, to direct the operations of the wars in which\r\nshe was engaged, and to conduct at will the diplomacy of the empire.\r\nHer first enemy was Sweden. That power demanded the restitution of\r\nFinland, and was refused; hostilities which, indeed, had commenced at the\r\ninstigation of France during the last reign, were resumed, but they were\r\nprosecuted with little vigour by the Swedes. The valour of the nation\r\nappeared to have died with their hero, Charles XII. So unfortunate were\r\ntheir arms that, by the Treaty of Nystad, in 1721, and that of Åbo, in\r\n1743, Livonia, Esthonia, Karelia, Ingermanland, Viborg, and Kexholm\r\npassed under the domination of Russia.\r\n\r\nStill worse than the loss of their possessions was the influence\r\nthenceforward exercised over the court of Stockholm by that of St.\r\nPetersburg. In vain did Sweden endeavour to moderate the exactions of the\r\nempress by electing the duke of Holstein, her nephew, successor to the\r\nthrone of the Goths: the Treaty of Åbo was not the less severe. It is,\r\nindeed, true that the intelligence of this election did not reach St.\r\nPetersburg until Elizabeth herself, who was resolved never to marry,[51]\r\nhad already nominated Duke Peter as her own successor; but she ought to\r\nhave received in a better spirit a step designed as an act of homage to\r\nherself.\r\n\r\nHad Elizabeth known her own interests, she would never have engaged in\r\nthe celebrated war which during so many years shook all Europe to its\r\ncentre. But, in the first place, she affected much commiseration for the\r\nPolish king, whose Saxon dominions were invaded by the Prussians, and\r\nwhom she called her ally. In the second, she was evidently actuated by a\r\npersonal antipathy to Frederick, and whoever were his enemies were sure\r\nto be her allies. It would, however, be wrong to suppose that personal\r\nfeeling alone was her sole motive for interfering in a foreign war.\r\nThere can be no doubt that even at this early period, and indeed long\r\nbefore this period, the ministers of Russia had cast a longing eye on the\r\npossessions of Poland.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [1757 A.D.]]\r\n\r\nCourland and Semigallia, though nominally dependent on the Polish crown,\r\nwere in reality provinces of Russia. They had been lost to Poland\r\nthrough the marriage of Anna, niece of Peter I, to Kettler, sovereign\r\nof the duchy. Though she had no issue; though Ferdinand, the successor\r\nof Kettler, was also childless; though the Polish diet contended, with\r\njustice, that the fief was revertible to the republic, Anna was resolved\r\nthat its future destiny should be changed. Under the pretext of certain\r\npecuniary claims, the Russian troops overran the territory; and the\r\nstates were compelled to elect Biron, the parent of the empress, to the\r\nvacant dignity. After the fall of that unprincipled adventurer, the\r\nstates, disgusted with Russian preponderance, had ventured to unite\r\ntheir suffrages in favour of Charles, son of Frederick Augustus III\r\nking of Poland; but Frederick durst not sanction the election until he\r\nhad obtained the permission of the empress Elizabeth. She could, for\r\nonce, well afford to be generous; and Duke Charles was suffered to take\r\npossession of the dignity. And, while on this subject, we may so far\r\nanticipate events as to add that Peter III, successor of Elizabeth,\r\nrefused to admit the rights of Charles, whom he expelled from the duchy;\r\nand that Catherine II incorporated it with her dominions. That Elizabeth\r\nherself had the ambitious views of her father, in reference not only to\r\nCourland but to other provinces, is certain; and, as we have already\r\nobserved, one of her motives for engaging in the great European contest\r\nwas the prospect of ulterior advantages. The pretext of succouring an\r\nally was sufficient to justify, in the eyes of Europe, the march of her\r\narmies. In this respect, her policy was macchiavellian enough. But to her\r\nthe war was an imprudent one; whatever her views, the time was not yet\r\narrived when they could be fully executed. Nor were the events always\r\nhonourable to the military glory of the empire. The reason is generally\r\nand, perhaps, justly assigned to the partiality of the grand duke Peter,\r\nthe heir presumptive, for the Prussian monarch--a partiality so great\r\nas to be inexplicable. The Russian generals, however anxious to win the\r\nfavour of their sovereign, still more the honours of successful warfare,\r\nwere yet loth to incur the dislike of Peter: hence the operations were\r\nindecisive; and success, when gained, was not pursued.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Antecedents of the Future Peter III_\r\n\r\nCharles Peter Ulrich, duke of Holstein Gottorp, whom Elizabeth had\r\nnominated her successor, who had embraced the Greek religion, and who,\r\nat his baptism, had received the name of Peter Fedorovitch, had arrived\r\nat St. Petersburg immediately after her accession. He was then in his\r\nfourteenth year. The education of this unfortunate prince was neglected;\r\nand the cause must be attributed alike to his own aversion to study and\r\nto the indifference of the empress. Military exercises were the only\r\noccupation for which he had any relish, and in them he was indulged.\r\nAt the palace of Oranienbaum, with which his aunt had presented him,\r\nhe passed the months of his absence from court--a period of freedom\r\nfor which he always sighed. As his recollections were German, so also\r\nwere his affections. He had little respect for those over whom he was\r\none day to reign: instead of native, he surrounded himself with young\r\nGerman officers. His addiction to such exercises became a passion, and\r\nwas doubtless one of the causes that so strongly indisposed him to more\r\nserious and more important pursuits.\r\n\r\nBut it was not the only cause. In his native province he had probably\r\nlearned to admire another propensity, common enough in his time--that\r\nof hard drinking; and it was not likely to be much impaired in such a\r\ncountry as Russia. His potations, which were frequent and long, were\r\nencouraged by his companions; and, in a few years, he became a complete\r\nbacchanalian. If we add that both he and they indulged in gratifications\r\nstill more criminal--in licentious amours--we shall not hesitate to\r\nbelieve the charge of profligacy with which he has been assailed. Whether\r\nthe empress was for some time privy to his excesses has been disputed;\r\nbut probability affirms that she was, and that, by conniving at these\r\nignoble pursuits, her policy was to keep him at a distance from the\r\naffairs of state. In this base purpose she was, from motives sufficiently\r\nobvious, zealously assisted by her ministers, especially by Bestuzhev.\r\nProfligate as was the grand duke, he was displeased with this state of\r\nrestraint; and he sometimes complained of it with a bitterness that was\r\nsure to be exaggerated by the spies whom they had placed near him.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Future Catherine II Appears_\r\n\r\nThe empress paid little attention to the reports concerning him.\r\nHer purpose was to disqualify him for governing, to render him too\r\ncontemptible to be dreaded; nor was she much offended with his murmurs.\r\nThat purpose was gained; for Peter had the reputation of being at\r\nonce ignorant, vicious, and contemptible. In a country so fertile in\r\nrevolutions, where unprincipled adventurers were ever ready to encourage\r\nthe discontent of anyone likely to disturb the existing order of things,\r\nthis reputation was one of the surest safeguards of Elizabeth’s throne.\r\nShe no longer feared that he would be made the tool of the designing,\r\nand she secretly exulted in the success of a policy which Macchiavelli\r\nhimself would have admired. Nor did she prove herself unworthy of that\r\ngreat master in the refined hypocrisy which made her represent her\r\nnephew as a prince of hopeful talents. But even she blushed at some of\r\nhis irregularities; and, in the view of justifying him, had furnished\r\nhim with a wife. Her choice was unfortunate; it was Sophia Augusta,\r\ndaughter of the prince of Anhalt-Zerbst, who, on her conversion to the\r\nGreek faith--a necessary preliminary to her marriage--had received the\r\nbaptismal name of Catherine.\r\n\r\nThis union was entitled to the more attention as in its consequences it\r\npowerfully affected not only the whole of Russia but the whole of Europe.\r\nShortly before its completion Peter was seized with the smallpox, which\r\nleft hideous traces on his countenance. The sight of him is said so far\r\nto have so affected Catherine that she fainted away. But, though she was\r\nonly in her sixteenth year, ambition had already over her more influence\r\nthan the tender passion, and she smothered her repugnance. Unfortunately,\r\nthe personal qualities of the husband were not of a kind to remove the\r\nill impression; if he bore her any affection, which appears doubtful,\r\nhis manners were rude, even vulgar; and she blushed for him whenever\r\nthey met in general society. What was still worse, she soon learned to\r\ndespise his understanding; and it required little penetration to foresee\r\nthat, whatever might be his title after Elizabeth’s death, the power must\r\nrest with Catherine. Hence the courtiers in general were more assiduous\r\nin their attentions to her than to him--a circumstance which did not\r\nmuch dispose him for the better. Finding no charms in his new domestic\r\ncircle, he naturally turned to his boon companions; his orgies became\r\nfrequent, and Catherine was completely neglected. Hence her indifference\r\nwas exchanged into absolute dislike.\r\n\r\nThe contrast between their characters exhibited itself in their conduct.\r\nWhile he was thus earning contempt for himself, she was assiduously\r\nstrengthening her party. She had the advantage--we should rather say the\r\ncurse--of being directed by a wily mother, who had accompanied her into\r\nRussia, and whose political intrigues were so notorious that at length\r\nshe was ordered by the empress to return into Germany. The grand duchess,\r\nhowever, had been too well tutored to suffer much by her mother’s\r\ndeparture; and she prosecuted her purpose with an ardour that would have\r\ndone honour to a better cause.\r\n\r\nSo long as the German princess remained at court, the conduct of\r\nCatherine was outwardly decorous; but now less restraint was observable\r\nin her behaviour. She was little deterred by the fear of worldly censure,\r\nin a court where the empress herself was anything but a model of\r\nchastity; and her marital fidelity soon came to be more than doubtful.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Court Intrigues; the Death of Elizabeth (1762 A.D.)_\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [1762 A.D.]]\r\n\r\nThat, in concert with several Russian nobles, of whom Bestuzhev was\r\nthe chief, Catherine meditated the exclusion of her husband from the\r\nthrone and the elevation of herself as regent during the minority of her\r\nson Paul, is a fact that can no longer be disputed. Hence the criminal\r\ncondescension of the chancellor to the views of Catherine; hence his\r\nefforts to prevail on the empress to nominate the infant Paul as her\r\nsuccessor. The indiscretion of the grand duke, who was no favourite with\r\nanybody; his frequent complaints of the tutelage in which he was held;\r\nhis bursts of indignation at his exclusion from the councils of the\r\nempire--were carefully related to his aunt, with such exaggeration as\r\nwere most likely to destroy the last traces of the lingering regard she\r\nbore him. All, indeed, who had been the friends of Catherine, all who had\r\nshared in the confidence of the minister, might well contemplate with\r\nalarm the succession of one that had vowed revenge against the partisans\r\nof both. Besides, the contempt which Peter felt, and which he seldom\r\nhesitated to express, for the Russian people, rendered his succession far\r\nfrom agreeable to them.\r\n\r\nThus, when, in 1757, Apraxin, field marshal of the Russian forces,\r\ninvaded Prussia, took Memel, and, near Jägerndorf, obtained a brilliant\r\nvictory over the troops of Frederick, yet, as if defeated, instantly\r\nfell back upon Courland, the cause was something more than the fear\r\nof offending Peter. This retrograde movement surprising, as well it\r\nmight, both the empress and her people, Apraxin was placed under arrest,\r\nand the command of the army bestowed on another general. He was tried\r\nfor the crime, but absolved--a result still more surprising to men\r\nwho regarded merely the surface of things. The reason was that the\r\ngrand-chancellor, Bestuzhev, had secretly ordered the marshal to retreat,\r\nand was, of course, his protector in the trial. It was not to please the\r\nheir-presumptive of the crown, whose blind adoration of the Prussian king\r\nwas so well known, that Bestuzhev despatched the secret order for Apraxin\r\nto retreat: it was that the chiefs of the army, of whom many were his\r\ncreatures, might be ready to join in effecting the revolution which was\r\nmeditated. But the ambitious minister, presuming on the distaste which\r\nhis imperial mistress generally showed for affairs, and still more on\r\nher bodily indisposition, which at this time placed her life in danger,\r\nproceeded too rapidly. His intrigues were discovered; his letter to the\r\nmarshal was produced; he was deprived of all his power; and Peter had the\r\njoy of seeing him exiled.\r\n\r\nThe general who succeeded Apraxin obtained advantages over the Russian\r\nmonarch, which had never been contemplated by his predecessor. But\r\nthough he took Königsberg, placed most of Prussia under contribution,\r\nand defeated the Prussian army in a decisive engagement, he, too,\r\nwas unwilling to irritate beyond forgiveness the heir of the empire,\r\nespecially as the reports which daily reached him of Elizabeth’s health\r\nconvinced him that the succession was not far distant. Under the pretext\r\nof illness, he demanded leave to retire. His successor, Soltikov (not,\r\nwe may be sure, the favourite of that name), was still more successful.\r\nFrederick was defeated in one of the best contested battles of this\r\nfamous war; Berlin was taken, and Kolberg reduced after a vigorous\r\nsiege. The news of this last success reached the empress, but she was no\r\nlonger capable of deriving satisfaction from it. Much to her honour, she\r\nwithstood all the solicitations of the intriguers who wished to exclude\r\nher nephew and to place Paul on the throne, under the regency of his\r\nmother. She died on the 5th day of January, 1762.[b]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Spread of Art, Literature, and Education under Elizabeth_\r\n\r\nThe empress Elizabeth had a passion for building; Peter the Great’s\r\nsummer palace and even the empress Anna’s winter palace appeared to her\r\nsmall and confined. Upon the site of the latter she began to build the\r\npresent edifices; during her reign was also built the vast, elegant,\r\nand beautiful palace at Tsarskoi Selo; the palace of Oranienbaum\r\nwas reconstructed, and the fine churches of the Smolni convent, of\r\nVladimirskaia and of Nicholas Morskoi (in St. Petersburg) were also\r\nerected. Some handsome private houses were built by Elizabeth’s noblemen,\r\nand in general St. Petersburg, which had not long before been a desert\r\nplace, consisting chiefly of wooden houses, became greatly embellished;\r\nthe palace quay, as may be seen from drawings and engravings of the time,\r\nalready showed a continuous row of huge stone edifices.\r\n\r\nOf course all these buildings cost enormous sums which led private\r\npersons into debt and the government into superfluous expenditure, but\r\nit is impossible not to observe that there was to be seen in this luxury\r\nan artistic quality which had never before existed. The finest edifices\r\nof that period form a special style, which after temporary neglect is\r\nnow beginning to be imitated; the creator of this style in Russia was\r\nCount Rastrelli--a foreigner, of whom, however, Russia has the right to\r\nspeak. The palaces and churches built by Rastrelli merit description, and\r\nalthough painting at that time did not represent a very high standard,\r\nyet the ceilings painted in accordance with the fashion of the day,\r\nwith bouquets of flowers and mythological goddesses, even now attract\r\nthe attention of artists. The grandees gave high prices for pictures by\r\nforeign masters; their houses became distinguished not only for their\r\nhandsome façades but also for the comfort of their interior arrangements;\r\nit would hardly be possible, for instance, to imagine anything more nobly\r\nelegant than the house of the chancellor Vorontzov (now the _corps des\r\nPages_).\r\n\r\nAll these beautiful architectural productions, and likewise those of\r\nmusic and painting, were for the greater part the work of foreign\r\nartists--visitors to Russia; but under their influence Russian artists\r\nwere formed and taste developed. The church of Nicholas Morskoi was built\r\nby a pupil of Rastrelli. The almost daily theatrical representations\r\nproduced at court gave rise to the idea of organising similar\r\nrepresentations at the _corps des Cadets_. The empress took a lively\r\ninterest in them; she often assisted at them and lent her diamonds for\r\nthe women’s costumes. In their turn these representations could not but\r\nassist the development of a taste for the stage, for dramatic art and\r\nliterature in general and from amongst the number of cadet actors not a\r\nfew became well known writers, as for instance Beketov, Kheraskov, and\r\nSumarokov.\r\n\r\nWe must dwell for a few moments on Sumarokov--a man who in his time\r\nenjoyed an extensive literary reputation and secured for himself the\r\nappellation of Father of the Russian Stage. The love of literature, and\r\nespecially of the stage, was already developed in Sumarokov when he\r\nwas in the corps des Cadets; when he was afterwards made aide-de-camp\r\nto Razumovski, he could almost daily assist at operas and ballets. At\r\nthat period he read with avidity the dramatic authors then in fashion:\r\nCorneille, Racine, Voltaire, and Molière became his idols; he decided to\r\ntry to imitate them in his own native language then very undeveloped, and\r\nin 1747 he wrote a tragedy, the _Chorists_.\r\n\r\nIt was not the merits of this work, which were very insignificant, but\r\nthe unwontedness of the appearance of an original Russian tragedy, and\r\nbesides that the fact of its being in verse, that so astounded and\r\nenraptured his contemporaries that they proclaimed Sumarokov the “Russian\r\nRacine”; encouraged by such a success he wrote a second and yet, a third\r\ntragedy; he took up comedy (for which he had hardly any more vocation)\r\nand in fact wrote a whole repertory; there were, however, no actors;\r\nbecause neither in St. Petersburg nor in Moscow did there any longer\r\nexist such company and such theatres as were begun in the time of Peter.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, far away from both capitals, in Iaroslav there was formed,\r\nalmost of itself without any commands or even any encouragement being\r\ngiven, a Russian dramatic company which is indissolubly bound up with the\r\nname of Volkov. Theodore Volkov was the son of a merchant and had been\r\neducated in the Iaroslav seminary, where, following the example of the\r\nAcademy of Kiev, and others, representations of a spiritual or religious\r\ncharacter were given. They produced a great impression upon the young\r\nmerchant; when later on he managed to get to St. Petersburg and saw on\r\nthe stage of the corps des Cadets a dramatic representation given with\r\nscenery, lighting, and mechanical contrivances, Volkov was stupefied with\r\nrapture and astonishment. Being to the highest degree sensitive to every\r\nartistic impression, being a painter, a musician, and a sculptor--all\r\nself-taught--Volkov was also endued with that constancy and patience\r\nwithout which even gifted natures do not attain to any results. Volkov\r\nstudied the material side of scenic art to the smallest details--that is,\r\nthe arrangement of the machinery, of the scenes, etc.; when he returned\r\nto Iaroslav he asked his parents, with whom he lived, to let him have an\r\nempty tanner’s shed; there he arranged a pit and a stage, and making up\r\na company of young merchants like himself, sons of citizens and clerks,\r\ngave representations which aroused the enthusiasm of all the spectators.\r\nThe intelligent and practical Volkov, seeing how the population of\r\nIaroslav flocked to his representations, named a price for them--a five\r\nkopeck piece for the first rows--and thus little by little he amassed a\r\nsum with which in 1752 he was able to build a general public theatre with\r\nroom for one thousand spectators.\r\n\r\nThe taste for the stage had meanwhile greatly spread in St. Petersburg;\r\nin various private houses dramatic representations were given at evening\r\nparties; it was therefore not surprising that the Iaroslav theatre\r\nsoon began to be talked of. The empress invited Volkov to come to St.\r\nPetersburg with his company, as she wished to see his representations\r\ngiven on the stage of the court theatre. She was remarkably pleased\r\nwith them, and four years later issued an ukase for the establishment\r\nof a public theatre. The first director of this theatre and almost\r\nthe only dramatic writer was Sumarokov; according to the testimony of\r\ncontemporaries Volkov was one of its most talented actors and his friend\r\nand fellow worker Dmitrievski a great artist.\r\n\r\nWe must here speak of another still more remarkable Russian native\r\ngenius--Lomonosov. It is well known how, when he was a youth of sixteen,\r\ndevoured by a thirst for knowledge, he secretly left the paternal roof\r\nand made his way on foot from Kholmogori to Moscow. How unattractive must\r\nlife and learning have appeared to him in those early days! “Having only\r\none altyn (a three-kopeck piece) a day for salary, it was impossible\r\nfor him to spend more on food than a halfpenny a day for bread and a\r\nhalfpenny worth of _kvass_ (a kind of beer or mead); the rest had to\r\ngo for paper, books, and other necessities.” Thus he described his\r\nlife in the Zaikonospaskvi Ecclesiastical Academy to Ivan Shuvalov and\r\nconcluded with the following words: “I lived thus for five years and\r\ndid not abandon science!” Theodore Prokopovitch, when he was already\r\nan old man, visited the Moscow academy a few years before his death;\r\nhe noticed Lomonosov there and praised him for his laboriousness and\r\nlearning. In 1737 Lomonosov was sent abroad to perfect himself and\r\nplaced himself under the surveillance of the then famous scholar, Wolff,\r\nwho, while despising him for his disorderly life, spoke with respect of\r\nhis capacities and success in study. Lomonosov followed the lectures\r\nof the German professors and amused himself with the German students.\r\nThe news of Minikh’s great victories and the taking of Khotin reached\r\nhim; his patriotic feelings were aroused, and he wrote an ode. When the\r\nverses were received in St. Petersburg everyone was struck with their\r\nharmony; and when Lomonosov returned from Germany in the beginning of\r\nElizabeth’s reign his reputation as a poet had already preceded him--the\r\nmore he wrote the greater his fame became. Poetry, however, was not\r\nLomonosov’s strongest point, and verses do not occupy a quarter of his\r\nentire works. His mind worked even more than his imagination, and his\r\nscholarly writings are striking in their variety. He composed a grammar\r\nof the Russian language from which several generations have learned;\r\nhe laid down rules of versification, the foundation of which are even\r\nnow recognised by everyone; he wrote on chemistry, physics, astronomy,\r\nmetallurgy, geology; he composed a Russian history, wrote a hypothesis\r\nconcerning the great learned expeditions and memoranda bearing on\r\nquestions of the state (as for instance measures for increasing and\r\nmaintaining the population in Russia): in fact, Lomonosov’s extraordinary\r\nintellect seemed to touch upon every branch of mental activity. He was\r\nmade a member of the St. Petersburg Academy of Sciences, but there the\r\nGerman element reigned supreme and Lomonosov was one of those who,\r\nwhile venerating the work of Peter the Great and the European learning\r\nintroduced by him, yet was oppressed by foreign tutorage and took offence\r\nwhen the Germans put forward their own countrymen to the detriment of\r\nmeritorious Russians. Continual disputes and quarrels arose between\r\nLomonosov and his fellow members; nor, being of a very impetuous and\r\nobstinate nature, was Lomonosov always in the right. His rough and sharp\r\nmeasures frequently led him into quarrels even outside the academy, for\r\ninstance with his literary brethren, Frediakovski and Sumarokov. All\r\nthis might greatly have injured Lomonosov, but fortunately for him he\r\npossessed powerful protectors in the persons of Count Worontzov and Count\r\nRazumovski, who liked to show favour to the first Russian scholar and\r\npoet.\r\n\r\nBut the strongest, truest, and most constant of his protectors was Ivan\r\nShuvalov. Shuvalov had many defects--his character was weak, lazy, and\r\ncareless; but he nevertheless represented one of the most consolatory\r\ntypes of his epoch: strong, energetic types were not uncommon in the\r\nfirst half of the eighteenth century, but gentle, benevolent, indulgent\r\nnatures were rarely to be met with. Shuvalov was not captivated by\r\nclamorous deeds, like the men of Peter’s time, but by the peaceful\r\nprogress of science and art. Therefore if the weakness of his character\r\nmade him an instrument for the ambitious designs of his cousin, his\r\nheartfelt sympathies drew him towards Lomonosov, of whom he naturally\r\nlearned much and--what is of more importance--with whom he devised means\r\nfor the spread of education in Russia. The result of these deliberations\r\nwas a vast plan for the establishment of schools throughout the\r\ngovernments, and finally of a university in Moscow. The establishment\r\nof a university seemed of the first necessity, as it was to furnish\r\nRussia with teachers; this had been Peter’s intention with regard to the\r\nacademy: but it had not been fulfilled. In his report to the senate upon\r\nthis subject, Shuvalov wrote that it would be desirable to appoint a\r\n“sufficient number of worthy men of the Russian nationality, acquainted\r\nwith the sciences, to spread education in distant parts among the common\r\npeople, so that thus superstition, dissent, and other like heresies\r\nproceeding from ignorance might be destroyed.” The senate approved\r\nShuvalov’s proposition and in 1755 the University of Moscow was founded.\r\n\r\nWe have given as just and complete a picture of the period of the\r\nempress Elizabeth as is possible in view of the scarcity of information\r\nobtainable concerning many circumstances of that time. Elizabeth left\r\nbehind her if not a great memory yet, broadly speaking, a good one. Her\r\nadministration may be reproached with much: in its foreign policy it\r\nwas not sufficiently independent; it was not sufficiently watchful in\r\ninterior affairs, where oversights occasioned special evils; moreover\r\nexamples of unlawful enrichment attained huge dimensions. But her reign\r\nmay be said to have led Russia out of bondage to the Germans, while the\r\nlevel of education was not in the smallest degree lowered, but on the\r\ncontrary considerably raised. Much that brought forth such brilliant\r\nfruits under Catherine II was sown under Elizabeth.[d]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Bain’s Estimate of Elizabeth_\r\n\r\nIt is the peculiar glory of Elizabeth Petrovna that she consulted once\r\nfor all the life work of her illustrious father. During the first\r\nfifteen years after the death of the great political regenerator, his\r\nstupendous creation, Russia, (before him we only hear of Muscovy,) was\r\nfrequently in danger. The reactionary boyars who misruled the infant\r\nempire under Peter II would have sacrificed both the new capital and the\r\nnew fleet, the twin pivots upon which the glory and the prosperity of the\r\nnew state may be said to have turned; the German domination under the\r\nempress Anna, directly contrary as it was to the golden rule of Peter,\r\n“Russia for the Russians,” threatened the nation with a western yoke\r\nfar more galling than the eastern or Tatar yoke of ruder times. From\r\nthis reaction, from this yoke the daughter of Peter the Great set the\r\nnation free, and beneath her beneficent sceptre Russia may be said to\r\nhave possessed itself again. All the highest offices of state were once\r\nmore entrusted to natives and to natives only, and whenever a foreigner\r\nwas proposed for the next highest, Elizabeth, before confirming the\r\nappointment, invariably inquired: “Is there then no capable Russian who\r\nwould do as well?” Moreover she inherited from her father the sovereign\r\ngift of choosing and using able councillors, and not only did she summon\r\nto power a new generation of native statesmen and administrators, but\r\nshe constrained them to work harmoniously together despite their mutual\r\njealousies and conflicting ambitions. She herself had advantageously\r\npassed through the bitter but salutary school of adversity. With all\r\nmanner of dangers haunting her path from her youth upwards, she had\r\nlearnt the necessity of circumspection, deliberation, self-control;\r\nshe had acquired the precious faculty of living in the midst of people\r\nintent on jostling each other, without in any way jostling them; and\r\nthese great qualities she brought with her to the throne without losing\r\nanything of that infinite good-nature, that radiant affability, that\r\npatriarchal simplicity which so endeared her to her subjects and made\r\nher, deservedly, the most popular of all the Russian monarchs. As regards\r\nher foreign policy, it may be safely affirmed she laid down the deep and\r\ndurable foundations upon which Catherine II was to build magnificently\r\nindeed, but too often, alas! so flimsily. The diplomacy of Elizabeth,\r\non the whole, was not so confident or so daring as the diplomacy of her\r\nbrilliant successor; but, on the other hand, it was more correct, equally\r\ndignified and left far less to chance. It must also be borne in mind that\r\nthe energy and firmness of Elizabeth considerably facilitated the task\r\nof Catherine by rendering Prussia, Russia’s most dangerous neighbour,\r\npractically harmless to her for the remainder of the century. This of\r\nitself was a political legacy of inestimable value, and it was not the\r\nonly one. All the great captains, all the great diplomatists of the “ever\r\nvictorious Catherine,” men like Rumiantsev, Suvarov, Riepnin, Besborodko,\r\nthe Panins and the Galitzins, were brought up in the school of Elizabeth.\r\nExcellent was the use which the adroit and audacious Catherine made of\r\nthese instruments of government, these pioneers of empire, but it should\r\nnever be forgotten that she received them all from the hands of the\r\ndaughter of Peter the Great.[g]\r\n\r\n\r\nPETER III (1762 A.D.)\r\n\r\nAs Elizabeth, on her death-bed, had confirmed the rights of Peter\r\nIII; and as the conspirators, deprived of Bestuzhev their guide, were\r\nunable to act with energy, the new emperor encountered no opposition.\r\nOn the contrary, he was immediately recognised by the military; and the\r\narchbishop of Novgorod, in the sermon preached on the occasion, thanked\r\nheaven that a prince so likely to imitate his illustrious grandfather was\r\nvouchsafed to Russia. Catherine was present. She wore a peculiar dress to\r\nconceal her pregnancy, and her countenance exhibited some indication of\r\nthe anxious feeling which she was obliged to repress. Compelled to defer\r\nthe execution of her ambitious purposes, and uncertain what vengeance\r\nthe czar might exert for her numerous infidelities, she might well be\r\napprehensive.\r\n\r\nBut she had no real foundation for the fear. Of all the sovereigns of\r\nthat or any age, Peter was among the most clement. Whether he thought\r\nthat clemency might bind to his interests one whose talents he had\r\nlearned to respect, or that her adherents were too numerous and powerful\r\nto allow of her being punished--whether, in short, he had some return of\r\naffection for her, or his own conscience told him that she had nearly as\r\nmuch to forgive as he could have, we will not decide. One thing only is\r\ncertain--that, in about three months after his accession, he invested\r\nher with the domains held by the late empress. Certainly his was a mind\r\nincapable of long continued resentment. His heart was better than his\r\nhead. Resolved to signalise his elevation by making others happy, he\r\nrecalled all whom his predecessor had exiled, except Bestuzhev. Many he\r\nrestored to their former honours and possessions. Thus the aged Munich\r\nwas made governor-general of Siberia, restored to his military command;\r\nwhile Biron, who certainly deserved no favour, was reinvested with the\r\nduchy of Courland. He did more: he restored the prisoners made by the\r\ngenerals of Elizabeth, and gave them money to defray their passage home.\r\nAnd, as Frederick had always been the object of his idolatry, the world\r\nexpected the armistice which he published, and which was preparatory to a\r\npeace between the two countries.\r\n\r\nThat declaration was an extraordinary document. In it the emperor\r\ndeclares that, his first duty being the welfare of his people, that\r\nwelfare could not be consulted so long as hostilities were continued;\r\nthat the war, which had raged six years, had produced no advantage to\r\neither party, but done incredible harm to both; that he would no longer\r\nsanction the wanton destruction of his species; that, in conformity\r\nwith the divine injunction relative to the preservation of the people\r\ncommitted to his charge, he would put an end to the unnatural, impious\r\nstrife; and that he was resolved to restore the conquests made by his\r\ntroops. In this case he had been praised, and with great justice, for\r\nhis moderation. We fear, however, he does not merit so high a degree of\r\npraise of humanity as many writers have asserted. At this moment, while\r\nproclaiming so loudly his repugnance to war, he was sending troops into\r\nhis native principality of Holstein, with the intention of wresting from\r\nthe king of Denmark the duchy of Schleswig, which he considered the\r\nrightful inheritance of his family. He even declared that he would never\r\nrest until he had sent that prince to Malabar.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PETER III\r\n\r\n(1728-1762)]\r\n\r\nNor must we omit to add that from the enemy he became the ally of\r\nFrederick; that his troops joined with the Prussians to expel the\r\nAustrians from the kingdom. His humanity only changed sides; if it spared\r\nthe blood of Prussians, it had little respect for that of Austrians. We\r\nmay add, too, that there was something like madness in his enthusiastic\r\nregard for Frederick. He corresponded with that monarch, whom he\r\nproclaimed his master, whose uniform he wore, and in whose armies he\r\nobtained the rank of major-general. Had he been capable of improvement,\r\nhis intercourse with that far-sighted prince might have benefited him.\r\nFrederick advised him to celebrate at Moscow his coronation--a rite of\r\nsuperstitious importance in the eyes of the multitude. He was advised,\r\ntoo, not to engage in the Danish war, not to leave the empire. But advice\r\nwas lost on him.\r\n\r\nIn some other respects, Peter deserves more credit than the admirers\r\nof Catherine are willing to allow him. (1) Not only did he pardon his\r\npersonal enemies--not only did the emperor forget the wrongs of the grand\r\nduke--but on several he bestowed the most signal favours. He suppressed\r\nthat abominable inquisitorial court, the secret chancery, which had\r\nconsigned so many victims to everlasting bondage, which had received\r\ndelations from the most obscure and vicious of men, which had made every\r\nrespectable master of a family tremble lest his very domestics should\r\nrender him amenable to that terrible tribunal. Had this been the only\r\nbenefit of his reign, well would he have been entitled to the gratitude\r\nof Russia. (2) He emancipated the nobles from the slavish dependence\r\non the crown, so characteristic of that barbarous people. Previous to\r\nhis reign, no boyar could enter on any profession, or forsake it when\r\nonce embraced, or retire from public to private life, or dispose of his\r\nproperty, or travel into any foreign country, without the permission of\r\nthe czar. By breaking their chains at one blow, he began the career of\r\nsocial emancipation. (3) The military discipline of the nation loudly\r\ndemanded reform, and he obeyed the call. He rescued the officers from the\r\ndegrading punishments previously inflicted; he introduced a better system\r\nof tactics; and he gave more independence to the profession. He did not,\r\nhowever, exempt the common soldier from the corporal punishment which\r\nat any moment his superior officers might inflict. (4) He instituted a\r\nuseful court to take cognisance of all offences committed against the\r\npublic peace, and to chastise the delinquencies of the men entrusted\r\nwith the general police of the empire. (5) He encouraged commerce, by\r\nlessening the duties on certain imports, and by abolishing them on\r\ncertain exports. (6) In all his measures, all his steps, he proved\r\nhimself the protector of the poor. In fact, one reason for the dislike\r\nwith which he was regarded by the nobles arose from the preference which\r\nhe always gave to the low over the high.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Impolitic Acts of Peter III_\r\n\r\nBut if impartial history must thus eulogise many of this monarch’s\r\nacts, the same authority must condemn more. He exhibited everywhere\r\ngreat contempt for the people whom he was called to govern. He had no\r\nindulgence for their prejudices, however indifferent, however inveterate.\r\nThus, in commanding that the secular clergy should no longer wear long\r\nbeards, and should wear the same garb as the clergy of other countries,\r\nhe offended his subjects to a degree almost inconceivable to us. In\r\nordering the images to be removed from the churches--he was still a\r\nLutheran, if anything--he did not lessen the odium which his other acts\r\nhad produced. The archbishop of Novgorod flatly refused to obey him, and\r\nwas in consequence exiled; but the murmurs of the populace compelled the\r\nczar to recall him. Still more censurable were his efforts to render\r\nthe church wholly dependent on the state--to destroy everything like\r\nindependence in its ministers; to make religion a mere engine in the\r\nhands of arbitrary power for the attainment of any object. His purpose,\r\nin fact, was to seize all the demesnes of the church--its extensive\r\nestates, its numerous serfs--and to pension the clergy like other\r\nfunctionaries.\r\n\r\nIn the ukase published on this occasion, he expressed a desire to\r\nrelieve ecclesiastics of the temporal cares so prejudicial to their\r\nghostly utility; to see that they indeed renounced the world, and free\r\nfrom the burden of perishing treasures, applied their whole attention\r\nto the welfare of souls. He therefore decreed that the property of the\r\nchurch should in future be managed by imperial officers; and that the\r\nclergy should receive, from the fund thus accumulated, certain annual\r\npensions, corresponding to their stations. Thus the archbishops of\r\nNovgorod, Moscow, and St. Petersburg were to have each 2,500 rubles; and\r\nthe same sum was to be allowed for the support of their households, of\r\ntheir capitular clergy, and for the sustentation of the sacred edifices.\r\nBut the twenty-three other archbishops and bishops were to have only\r\n3,000 rubles for both purposes. The salaries of the other ecclesiastics\r\nwere carefully graduated. The inferior were divided into three\r\nclasses--individuals of the first to receive 500, of the second 300, of\r\nthe third 150 rubles per annum. The surplus funds were to be applied to\r\nthe foundation of hospitals, to the endowment of colleges, and to the\r\ngeneral purposes of the state.\r\n\r\nPeter attempted these and other innovations in virtue of the two-fold\r\ncharacter which, from the time of his grandfather, the czars had been\r\nanxious to assume, as supreme heads alike of religion and of the state.\r\nNot even the grand lama of Thibet ever arrogated a higher degree of\r\ntheocratic authority. Indeed, our only surprise is that in addition to\r\ntheir other functions they did not assume that of bishops; that they did\r\nnot array themselves in pontificals, and celebrate mass at the altar. But\r\nthey certainly laid something like a claim to the sacerdotal character.\r\nThus, on the death of the patriarch, Peter I opposed the election of\r\nanother supreme head of the church; and when he found that the synod\r\ndurst not venture on so far irritating the people as to dispense with\r\nthe dignity, he insisted on being elected himself. If the sultan of\r\nConstantinople combined with himself the two-fold character, why should\r\nit be refused to him? The reign of Peter was too short to permit his\r\ndesigns of spoliation to be carried into effect; but, by confirming\r\nthe dangerous precedent of his grandfather, he had done enough, and\r\nhis successor Catherine was enabled to complete the robbery which he\r\ncommenced.\r\n\r\nBut the most impolitic measure of Peter--that which rendered those who\r\nmight have defended him indifferent to his fate--was his conduct towards\r\nthe imperial guards. Two regiments he ordered to be in readiness for\r\nthe Danish war. This was contrary to custom. In the faith of remaining\r\nnear the court, most of the soldiers had embraced the military life; and\r\nthey were as indignant as they were surprised when told that they must\r\nexchange the dissipations of a metropolis for the fatigues and privations\r\nattending a distant campaign. They were offended, too, with the\r\nintroduction of the Prussian discipline, which they found by experience\r\nto be far more rigid than that to which they had hitherto been subject;\r\nand they patriotically condemned the innovation as prejudicial to the\r\nmilitary fame of the empire. Still more irritating was the preference\r\nwhich he everywhere gave to the German over the native troops. His most\r\nintimate friends were Germans; the officers around his person were of the\r\nsame nation; Germans directed the manœuvres not only of his household\r\nbut of all his regiments; and a German--Prince George of Holstein, his\r\nuncle--was placed at the head of all the imperial armies.\r\n\r\nCouple these acts of imprudence with others of which he was hourly\r\nguilty. In his palace of Oranienbaum he constructed a Lutheran chapel;\r\nand though he appears to have been indifferent to every form of religion,\r\nhe held this in much more respect than the Greek form, which in fact,\r\nhe delighted to ridicule. If churchmen became his enemies, the people\r\nin general were not likely to become his friends when they heard of a\r\nboast--probably a true one--that in the last war he had acquainted the\r\nPrussian monarch with the secrets of the imperial cabinet. Lastly, he\r\ninsulted men of honour by making them the jest of his buffoons.\r\n\r\nCircumstances much less numerous and much less cogent than these would\r\nhave sufficed so ambitious, able, and unprincipled a woman as Catherine\r\nto organise a powerful conspiracy against the czar. But he was accused\r\nof many other things of which he was perfectly innocent. In fact, no\r\neffort seems to have been spared to invent and propagate stories to his\r\ndisadvantage. In some instances, it is scarcely possible to separate\r\nthe true from the false. Whether, for example, he, from the day of his\r\naccession, resolved to divorce his wife, to marry his mistress, to set\r\naside Paul from succession, and to adopt Ivan, still confined in the\r\nfortress of Schlüsselburg, can never be known with certainty. That he\r\nsecretly visited that unhappy prince seems undoubted; but we have little\r\nevidence for the existence of the design attributed to him. If, in fact,\r\nhe sincerely contemplated raising the daughter of Count Vorontzov to the\r\nimperial throne, he would scarcely have adopted Ivan, unless he felt\r\nassured that no issue would arise from the second marriage. He could\r\nnot, however, entertain any regard for a consort who had so grievously\r\ninjured him, and little for a boy whom he knew was not his own. And, as\r\nthere is generally some foundation for every report, there seems to be no\r\ndoubt that Peter had promised to marry his mistress if she survived his\r\nwife. The report was enough for Catherine: on it she built her own story\r\nthat her life was in danger; and that if her son were not designed for a\r\nsimilar fate, he would at least have that of Ivan.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Catherine Plots against the Czar_\r\n\r\nThe anxiety of the empress to secure adherents was continually active;\r\nand as her husband passed so much time in drunkenness, her motions were\r\nnot so closely scrutinised as they should have been. Gregory Orlov, her\r\ncriminal favourite, was the man in whom she placed the most reliance.\r\nGregory had four brothers--all men of enterprise, of courage, of\r\ndesperation; and none of them restricted by the least moral principle.\r\nPotemkin, afterwards so celebrated, was the sixth. This man was, perhaps,\r\nthe most useful of the conspirators, as by means of his acquaintance\r\nwith the priests of the metropolis he was able to enlist that formidable\r\nbody in the cause. They were not slow to proclaim the impiety of the\r\nczar, his contempt of the orthodox faith, his resolution “to banish\r\nthe fear of the Lord” from the Russian court, to convert churches into\r\nhospitals and barracks, to seize on all revenues of the church, and\r\nto end by compelling the most orthodox of countries to embrace the\r\nerrors of Luther. The archimandrites received these reports from the\r\nparish priests, the bishops from the archimandrites; nor was there much\r\ndifficulty in obtaining an entrance for them into the recesses of the\r\nneighbouring monasteries. The hetman of the Cossacks, an officer of\r\ngreat authority and of great riches, was next gained. Not less effectual\r\nthan he was the princess Dashkov, who, though the sister of Peter’s\r\nmistress, was the most ardent of the conspirators: perhaps the threatened\r\nexaltation of that sister, by rendering her jealous, only strengthened\r\nher attachment to the czarina. Through the instrumentality of this woman,\r\nCount Panin, the foreign minister and the governor of the grand duke\r\nPaul, was gained over. Whether the argument employed was, as one writer\r\nasserts, the sacrifice of her sister, or whether, as another affirms, she\r\nwas the daughter of the count, who notoriously intrigued with her mother,\r\nis of no moment. What is certain is, that the count was exceedingly fond\r\nof her; and one authority expressly asserts that he became acquainted\r\nwith the details of the conspiracy before her, and admitted her into the\r\nplot. This, however, is less probable than the relation we have given;\r\nfor the princess had long been the friend of Catherine.\r\n\r\nHer activity was unceasing. A Piedmontese adventurer, Odart by name,\r\nbeing forced to leave his native country for some crime, and having\r\ntried in vain to obtain a subsistence in the neighbouring capitals,\r\nwisely resolved to try his fortune in St. Petersburg--a city where guilt\r\nmight reside with impunity, and where it had only to be successful to\r\nwin the applause of mankind. As he had a considerable knowledge of the\r\nfine arts, especially of music and painting, he had little difficulty in\r\nobtaining an introduction to the princess Dashkov. She, who had a shrewd\r\ninsight into human character, soon perceived that this supple, crafty,\r\nactive, sober, intriguing, unprincipled foreigner was just the man that\r\nwas required to act as spy and confidential agent. He was introduced\r\nto Catherine, whose opinion confirmed that of her favourite. No choice\r\ncould, indeed, have been better. Little cared he in what service he\r\nwas employed. If a partisan were to be gained, no man could be more\r\ninsinuating: if an enemy were to be removed, he had his pistols and his\r\ndirk, without which he never appeared in the street. His penetration soon\r\nenabled him to secure the aid of two other bravos--the one, Possik, a\r\nlieutenant in the guards; the other, Globov, a lawyer in the employment\r\nof the senate. Of the character of these men, some notion may be formed\r\nfrom the fact that Possik offered to stab the emperor in the midst of the\r\ncourt. He knew how to ally duplicity with desperation; he was at once the\r\nhypocritical intriguer and the remorseless bravo.\r\n\r\nThrough the same Princess Dashkov, Volkonski, major-general of the\r\nguards, was won; and by Potemkin, or his ghostly allies, the archbishop\r\nof Novgorod was soon in the secret. The hetman of the Cossacks went\r\nfurther. Great as was the danger of entrusting that secret to many,\r\nhe assembled the officers who served under him, assured them that he\r\nhad heard of a conspiracy to dethrone the emperor, too irresistible\r\nto be appeased; and exhorted them to seize the favourable moment of\r\npropitiating the favour of the czarina, rather than, by remaining hostile\r\nor inactive, to bring down vengeance on their own heads. His advice had\r\nall the success that he could desire.\r\n\r\nWhile these most vicious and in every way most worthless of men were\r\nthus employed in her behalf, Catherine was no less active. She knew that\r\nCount Panin espoused the cause of her son--less, perhaps, from affection\r\nto his charge, than from the hope of exercising more power under an\r\ninfant emperor than under one of the mother’s enterprising character.\r\nHer promise, that his influence should be second only to her own, made\r\nhim her willing instrument. His defection constrained the rest of the\r\nconspirators: there was no more heard of a regency; and Catherine was to\r\nbe proclaimed autocratrix of all the Russias.\r\n\r\nWithout increasing unnecessarily the number of the initiated, she yet\r\nprepared the minds of many for some impending change, and rendered them\r\neager for its arrival by her artful and seasonable insinuations. If an\r\nofficer of the guards stood near her, she whispered in his ear that the\r\nemperor had resolved on disbanding the present force, and exiling its\r\nchiefs; if an ecclesiastic, she bewailed the fate of the pure orthodox\r\nchurch; if a less interested person, she lamented her own misfortunes\r\nand those of her son--both doomed to immediate imprisonment, and she, at\r\nleast, to an ultimate death. If a senator were near, she deplored the\r\nmeditated destruction of the venerable and patriotic body to which he\r\nbelonged; the transformation of the debauchees, perpetually around the\r\nemperor, into judges; and the substitution of the _Code Frederic_ for the\r\nancient law of Russia.\r\n\r\nBy these means she prepared the minds of the people for the revolution:\r\nher affability, in fact, was the theme of their praise. But she did not\r\ntrust merely to their good will. She knew that, unless two or three\r\nregiments were secured, the insurrection might not find immediate\r\nsupporters, and that the critical moment might be lost. Without\r\nmoney this object could not be obtained; and though both she and her\r\nconfidential agents voluntarily disbursed all that they could command,\r\nand converted their most valuable effects into coin, the amount was\r\nalarmingly inadequate. In this emergency she applied to the French\r\nambassador for a loan; and when he showed less readiness to accommodate\r\nher than she expected, she addressed herself, we are told, to the\r\nambassador from England, and with more success. But this statement is\r\nuntrue: it was not the English ambassador, but an English merchant, who\r\nfurnished her with the sum she demanded. With this aid, she prevailed on\r\nthe greater part of three regiments to await the signal for joining her.\r\n\r\nThough the conspirators were, in point of numbers, formidable, their\r\nattempt was one of danger. Peter was about to leave Russia for Holstein,\r\nto prosecute the war against the Danish king; and of the troops whom he\r\nhad assembled, though the greater part were on their march, some were\r\nnow with him, and might be induced to defend him. Besides, the two great\r\ndivisions of his fleet were at Kronstadt and Revel, and nobody could\r\nforesee how they would act. The conspirators agreed that he should be\r\ntaken by surprise; that midnight should see him transferred from the\r\nthrone to a dungeon. The festival of St. Peter and St. Paul--one of high\r\nimportance in the Greek church--was approaching: the following day the\r\nemperor had resolved to depart. It was to be celebrated at Peterhov;\r\nthere it was resolved to arrest him.\r\n\r\nBut accident hastened the execution of the plot. Until the arrival of\r\nthe festival, Peter left St. Petersburg for Oranienbaum, to pass in riot\r\nand debauchery the intervening time. Accompanied by the most dissolute\r\nof his favourites, and by many of the court ladies, he anticipated the\r\nexcesses which awaited his arrival. That he had received some hints of a\r\nplot, though he was unacquainted alike with its object and authors, is\r\nexceedingly probable. His royal ally of Prussia is said to have advised\r\nhim to be on his guard, and several notes are supposed to have been\r\naddressed to him by his own subjects. If such information was received,\r\nit made no impression on him; and indeed its vagueness might well render\r\nhim indifferent to it. But on the eve of his departure, when the superior\r\nofficer of Passik, who had accidentally learned that danger attended\r\nthe steps of the emperor, denounced the lieutenant, and the culprit was\r\narrested, he had an opportunity of ascertaining all the details of the\r\nconspiracy. He treated the denunciation with contempt; affirmed that\r\nPassik belonged to the dregs of the people, and was not to be dreaded;\r\nand proceeded to Oranienbaum. The culprit, though narrowly watched, had\r\ntime to write a line to the hetman, whom he exhorted to instant action,\r\nif they wished to save their lives. The note fell into the hands of the\r\nprincess Dashkov, who immediately assembled the conspirators.\r\n\r\nNot a moment was to be lost: the presence of Catherine was indispensable;\r\nand, though it was midnight and she was at Peterhov, seven leagues\r\ndistant from St. Petersburg, one of the Orlovs went to bring her.\r\nHe arrived at the fortress, entered a private door, and by a secret\r\nstaircase ascended to the apartments occupied by the empress. It was now\r\ntwo o’clock in the morning: the empress was asleep; and her surprise was\r\nnot unmixed with terror, when she was awakened by a soldier. In a moment\r\nshe comprehended her situation: she arose, called one of her women, and\r\nboth, being hastily clad in a strange habit, descended with the soldier\r\nto one of the gates, passed the sentinel without being recognised, and\r\nstepped into the carriage which was waiting for her. Orlov was the\r\ndriver, and he urged the horses with so much severity that before they\r\nhad proceeded half way from Peterhov to St. Petersburg, they fell down\r\nfrom exhaustion. The situation of the empress was critical: she might at\r\nany moment be overtaken; and she was certain that with the dawn of day\r\nPeter would acquire some more definite intelligence of the plot. In a\r\nstate bordering on distraction, she took refuge in the first house that\r\nshe approached: it was a tavern, and here she burned the letters which\r\nhad passed between her and the conspirators. Again she recommenced her\r\njourney on foot: by good fortune she met a countryman with a cart; Orlov\r\nseized the vehicle, the peasant ran away; Catherine ascended it, and, in\r\nthis undignified manner, she, her woman, and Orlov entered St. Petersburg\r\nabout seven o’clock on the morning of July the 9th.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Catherine Usurps the Crown_\r\n\r\nNo sooner was Catherine in the capital than she was joined by the hetman;\r\nand, accompanied by him, she hastened to the barracks of the troops which\r\nhe commanded. Four companies immediately declared for her; their example\r\nconstrained the rest of the regiment; three other regiments, hearing the\r\nacclamation, and seeing the people hurry to the spot, joined in the cry;\r\nall St. Petersburg was in motion; a report was spread that she and her\r\nson had just escaped assassination by order of the czar; her adherents\r\nrapidly multiplied: and, accompanied by about two thousand soldiers, with\r\nfive times that number of citizens, who loudly proclaimed her sovereign\r\nof Russia, she went to the church of Our Lady of Kazan. Here everything\r\nwas prepared for her reception: the archbishop of Novgorod, with a host\r\nof ecclesiastics, awaited her at the altar; she swore to observe the laws\r\nand religion of the empire; the crown was solemnly placed on her head;\r\nshe was proclaimed sole monarch of Russia, and the grand duke Paul her\r\nsuccessor; and _Te Deum_ concluded the eventful ceremony.\r\n\r\nFrom the church she proceeded to the palace occupied by the late empress;\r\nthe mob crowded to see her, and to take the oath of allegiance; while\r\nthe more respectable portion of the citizens were awed into submission,\r\nor at least into silence, by a report that Peter had just been killed\r\nby falling from his horse. To gratify the populace, the taverns were\r\nabandoned to them: the same fate visited the houses of all who were\r\nobnoxious to the conspirators; intoxication was general; robbery was\r\nexercised with impunity; the palace, to which Catherine had hastened, was\r\nstrengthened; a numerous guard was stationed in its defence; a manifesto\r\nwas proclaimed; a notification was delivered into the hands of each\r\nforeign minister, and the revolution was complete.\r\n\r\nOne object of the conspirators had been to close every avenue of egress\r\nfrom the capital, that Peter might not be acquainted with the revolution\r\nuntil it was too powerful to be repressed. All the troops in the vicinity\r\nwere called within the walls; but there was one regiment about sixteen\r\nhundred strong, which lay between the city and Peterhov, the conduct of\r\nwhich was doubtful. Without the slightest knowledge of what had taken\r\nplace, the colonel arrived in the city, and was soon persuaded not only\r\nto declare for the new sovereign but to prevail on the regiment to follow\r\nhis example. He was successful; and, with the whole body, he returned in\r\ntriumph to the capital. On this very day Peter had promised to dine with\r\nCatherine: on reaching Peterhov he was surprised to hear of her flight.\r\nVorontzov, the father of his mistress, the father also of the princess\r\nDashkov, who had witnessed without repugnance the dishonour alike of\r\nhis wife and daughter, proposed to the emperor to visit St. Petersburg\r\nto ascertain the cause of her departure; and, if any insurrection were\r\nmeditated, to suppress it. He arrived in the presence of the empress, was\r\ninduced to swear allegiance to her, and was ordered to retire into his\r\nown house.\r\n\r\nBut Peter had already been informed of the revolution; and he traversed\r\nwith hasty steps the gardens of Peterhov, indecisive and terrified. Yet\r\nhe was not wholly deserted. The brave Munich, whose locks were ripened\r\nby age, and whose wisdom equalled his valour, advised him instantly\r\nto place himself at the head of his Holstein troops, march on the\r\ncapital, and thereby enable all who were yet loyal to join him. Whether\r\nthe result would have been such as the veteran anticipated, _viz._ a\r\ncounter-revolution, may well be doubted; but there can be no doubt that\r\na considerable number of soldiers would have joined him, and that he\r\nwould have been able to enter into negotiations with the hostile party.\r\nHe was too timid to adopt the suggestion: nothing, in fact, could urge\r\nhim to decisive action. When informed that Catherine was making towards\r\nPeterhov, at the head of ten thousand men, all that he could resolve to\r\ndo was to send messengers to her with proposals. His first was that the\r\nsupreme power should be divided between them; the second, when no reply\r\nwas deigned to his letter, that he should be allowed to leave Russia,\r\nwith his mistress and a favourite, and pass the rest of his days in\r\nHolstein. She detained his messenger, and still advanced.\r\n\r\nMunich now advised him to embark for Kronstadt, and join his fleet,\r\nwhich was still faithful; but unfortunately he delayed so long that one\r\nof Catherine’s emissaries had time to corrupt the garrison of the fort:\r\non arriving, he was prohibited from disembarking, and told that if he\r\ndid not immediately retire his vessel would be sunk by the cannon of the\r\nplace. Still he had a fleet at Revel; and if it were disloyal he might\r\nescape into Prussia, Sweden, or Holstein. With the fatality, however,\r\nwhich characterised all his measures on this eventful day, he returned\r\nto Oranienbaum, where he disembarked at four o’clock in the morning of\r\nJuly the 10th. Here he was soon visited by the emissaries of Catherine;\r\nwas persuaded to sign an act of abdication; was conducted to Peterhov;\r\nwas divested of all his imperial orders; was clad in a mean dress, and\r\nconsigned, first to one of the country houses of the hetman, and soon\r\nafterwards to the fortress of Ropscha, about twenty miles distant from\r\nPeterhov. He was not allowed to see the empress; and his mistress and\r\nattendants were separated from him.[b]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Death of Peter III (1762 A.D.)_\r\n\r\nWhat was to be done with Peter? At the deliberations on this question\r\nCatherine calmly listened to arguments as to the necessity of measures\r\nbeing taken in order that the former emperor should not injure her rule\r\nby disturbing weak minds; she clearly realised all the dangers that might\r\nbe created for her, if not by Peter himself at any rate by his partisans.\r\nThey were not numerous, yet they did exist and they might multiply in the\r\nfuture. It was necessary that Peter should be definitively made harmless,\r\nbut how was it to be done? During the deliberations on the means to be\r\ntaken, no restraint was imposed by Catherine’s presence. The empress\r\nwas not an Elizabeth Petrovna: she at once understood the uselessness\r\nof imprisonment at Schlüsselburg or any other place; she was not likely\r\nto fall into a fainting fit at any proposition made. The examples of\r\nIvan the Terrible and Peter the Great did not disturb her. Nevertheless,\r\nnot one of those present, not even the persons nearest to her, reading\r\nin her eyes the secret desire decisively to finish once for all with\r\nthis unbearable question, would have dared even to hint at an unnatural\r\ndeath--they knew Catherine, they might read her thought, but not aloud.\r\n\r\nWhen the persons who surrounded Catherine were definitively convinced\r\nthat Peter’s removal was recognised by her as indispensable, they decided\r\nto devise a means for it without her knowledge and to accomplish it\r\nwithout her consent. In this were interested all the personal partisans\r\nof Catherine, those “chosen sons of the people,” who had stirred up the\r\nempress to put herself at the head of the movement. They were far more\r\ninterested in the matter than Catherine herself: the change had been\r\nbrought about by all classes of society, by the whole nation, not by her;\r\nno one could even think of the detested Peter ascending the throne a\r\nsecond time--it was not on Catherine that the malcontents would revenge\r\nthemselves, that is if there were or would be any, but on the “chosen\r\nof the people.” Peter did not prevent a change being brought about;\r\nstill, he might hinder not Catherine but many of the “chosen ones” from\r\nreaping the fruits of their labours. The Orlov brothers were above all\r\ninterested in the matter; all of them, and especially Gregory, occupied\r\nimportant posts, which gave them the right to dream of great things; the\r\nrealisation of these dreams could, it seemed to them, be prevented only\r\nby Peter’s perpetual imprisonment. As long as Peter lived, Catherine\r\nwas not free: it was now observed by everyone that in the manifesto of\r\nthe 28th of June Peter was not once called the consort, the husband of\r\nCatherine; but such bonds imposed by the church are not broken either by\r\nmanifestoes or imprisonment: Peter living, by the one fact of his being\r\nalive, prevented the Orlovs from attaining the final results of their\r\nefforts, their sacrifices. No matter by what means, somehow the Orlovs\r\nmust guard not merely what was as yet only possible and cherished in\r\ntheir dreams, but the good fortune that had already been attained to;\r\nand, for this, haste must be made. The favour shown to them, especially\r\nto Gregory, was visible to every eye. At the court there were already\r\nsnares laid for them, intrigues began to be carried on against them,\r\nendeavours were made to overthrow Gregory; if Gregory fell his brothers\r\nwould fall with him. Haste must be made.\r\n\r\nOn Wednesday, the 3rd of July, on the fourth day after the appearance of\r\nthe attacks of Peter’s illness, in the evening the doctor, Leyders, came\r\nto Ropscha from St. Petersburg. On Thursday, the 4th of July, the former\r\nemperor probably grew worse: at any rate a second doctor came that day\r\nfrom St. Petersburg--the regimental surgeon Paulsen. The doctors did not\r\nobserve any change for the worse, and according to the expressions of the\r\nlanguage of contemporaries, the condition of the patient left nothing to\r\nbe desired. Friday passed quietly. On Saturday, the 6th of July, in the\r\nmorning while the prisoner was still asleep, the valet who attended on\r\nPeter went out into the garden, “to breathe the fresh air.” An officer\r\nwho was in the garden ordered him to be seized and the valet was put into\r\na carriage which stood in readiness and removed from Ropscha. In the\r\nevening, at six o’clock, a messenger who had ridden from Ropscha gave to\r\nCatherine a packet from Alexis Orlov. On a sheet of soiled gray paper, in\r\nthe ignorant handwriting of Alexis Orlov and by his own drunken hand was\r\ntraced the following:\r\n\r\n    Merciful sovereign mother![52]\r\n\r\n    How can I explain, how describe what has happened; you will\r\n    not believe your faithful servant; but before God I speak the\r\n    truth. Matushka! I am ready to go to my death; but I myself\r\n    do not know, how this calamity happened. We are lost, if you\r\n    do not have mercy. Matushka, he is no more on earth. But no\r\n    one had thought of this, and how could we have thought to\r\n    raise our hands against the sovereign! But, your majesty, the\r\n    calamity is accomplished. At table he began to dispute with\r\n    Prince Theodore;[53] we were unable to separate them and he was\r\n    already no more; we do not ourselves remember what we did; but\r\n    we are all equally guilty and deserving of punishment. Have\r\n    mercy upon me, if it is only for my brother’s sake. I have\r\n    brought you my confession and seek for nothing. Forgive or\r\n    command that it may be quickly finished. The world is not kind;\r\n    we have angered you and destroyed our souls forever.\r\n\r\nThe news of death is a great matter. It is impossible either to prepare\r\nfor it or grow accustomed to it. In the present case the death of Peter,\r\ndoing away with many perplexities, and giving a free hand to many\r\npersons, appeared as the only possible and most desirable issue to the\r\npolitical drama which was agitating the people of Russia. Nevertheless\r\nthe news of this death struck some, disturbed others, and puzzled all as\r\nan unexpected sudden phenomenon. On Catherine it produced the strongest\r\nimpression, and (justice must be rendered to her) she was the first to\r\ncontrol herself, to examine into the mass of new conditions, created by\r\nthe death of Peter, and to master the various feelings which made their\r\ninvasion together with the news of the catastrophe of Ropscha.\r\n\r\n“_Que je suis affectée: même terrassée par cette mort_” (How affected\r\nand even overwhelmed I am by this death), said Catherine to Princess\r\nDashkov. She was touched by it as a woman; she was struck by it as\r\nempress. Catherine clearly recognised her position: the death of Peter,\r\na death that was so sudden, would at such a time awaken rumours, throw a\r\nshadow on her intentions, lay a spot on the memory of those until then\r\nclear, bright ten days; yet she did not hide from herself that it was\r\nonly by death that the great undertaking “begun by us” could be entirely\r\nconsummated. The tragedy of Catherine’s position was still further\r\nincreased by the circumstance of Alexis Orlov’s having taken an active\r\npart in the catastrophe of Ropscha: she was under great obligations to\r\nthe Orlovs as empress, while as a woman she was bound by the ties of\r\naffection to Gregory Orlov; she loathed the crime, but she could not give\r\nup the criminal. “One must be firm in one’s resolutions,” said Catherine,\r\n“only weak-minded people are undecided.” Even she herself, she must\r\nconceal the crime and protect the criminal, taking upon herself all the\r\nmoral responsibility and political burden of the catastrophe. Catherine\r\nthen for the first time showed a healthy political understanding of the\r\nwidest diapason and played the rôle she had taken upon herself with the\r\ntalent of a virtuoso.\r\n\r\nThe letter of Alexis Orlov, which entirely exculpated her from all\r\nsuspicion was hidden in a cupboard, where it lay for thirty-four years,\r\nuntil the very death of the empress. With the exception of two or three\r\npersons in the immediate entourage of Catherine, who were near her at the\r\nmoment when the letter was received besides Nikita Panin and the hetman\r\nRazumovski, no one ever read it, no one knew of it while the empress\r\nlived. Having decided upon the fate of the letter, she herself marked\r\nout the programme of her actions clearly and shortly: “_Il faut marcher\r\ndroit; je ne dois pas être suspecte_.” (I must walk uprightly; I must not\r\nbe suspected.)\r\n\r\nThe programme was exactly fulfilled. The letter of Alexis Orlov did not\r\ncommunicate the trifling details of the catastrophe, but the general\r\nsignification of the narrative did not leave any doubts as to its chief\r\nfeatures, and therefore Catherine considered it first of all necessary\r\nto certify whether poison had been employed; the postmortem examination,\r\nmade by order of the empress, did not show the least trace of poison.\r\nNeither the medical certificate as to the cause of death nor the act\r\nof death has been preserved; we can only guess that these certificates\r\ndirected the composition of the following “mourning” manifesto:\r\n\r\n    On the seventh day after our acceptation of the throne of all\r\n    the Russias, we received the news that the former emperor\r\n    Peter III, by an attack of hemorrhage which was common and\r\n    previously frequent to him, had fallen into a most dangerous\r\n    condition. In order therefore not to neglect our Christian duty\r\n    and the sacred command, by which we are obliged to preserve the\r\n    life of our neighbour, we immediately ordered that everything\r\n    necessary should be sent to him in order to avert consequences\r\n    that might be dangerous to his health through this mischance,\r\n    and tend to assist to his speedy recovery. But to our extreme\r\n    grief and trouble of heart, we yesterday evening received news\r\n    that, by the will of God, he had departed this life. We have\r\n    therefore commanded that his body should be taken to the Nevski\r\n    monastery to be there interred; meanwhile we incite and exhort\r\n    all our true and faithful subjects by our imperial and maternal\r\n    word that, without evil remembrance of all that is past, they\r\n    should raise to God their heartfelt prayers that forgiveness\r\n    and salvation of his soul may be granted to the deceased;\r\n    this unexpected decree by God of his death we accept as a\r\n    manifestation of the divine providence through which God in\r\n    his inscrutable judgment lays the path, known to his holy will\r\n    alone, to our throne and to the entire fatherland. Given at St.\r\n    Petersburg on the 7th day of July, 1762.\r\n\r\n                                                          CATHERINE.\r\n\r\nThe Russian made the sign of the cross as he read this manifesto. Yes,\r\nthe judgments of God are indeed inscrutable! The former emperor had\r\nexperienced in his last days so many sorrows, so many reverses--no wonder\r\nhis feeble, sickly nature, which had already suffered from attacks of\r\nhemorrhage, would not withstand these shocks; in the matter of death\r\nnobody is free: he had fallen ill and died. To the common people his\r\ndeath appeared natural; even the upper classes, although they might\r\nhear even if they did not know something, did not admit any thoughts of\r\nCatherine’s having had any share in his death. The empress “must not be\r\nsuspected” and she remained unsuspected. On the night between Sunday,\r\nthe 7th of July, and Monday, the 8th, the body was brought straight\r\nto St. Petersburg, directly to the present monastery of St. Alexander\r\nNevski to the same place where the body of the princess Anna of Brunswick\r\nwas exposed for reverence, and later on the body of the princess Anna\r\nPetrovna, Catherine’s daughter.[e]\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES\r\n\r\n[49] It is said that when the infant Ivan heard the shouts of the\r\nsoldiers in front of the palace, he endeavoured to imitate their\r\nvociferations, when Elizabeth exclaimed, “Poor babe! thou knowest not\r\nthat thou art joining in the noise that is raised at thy undoing.”\r\n\r\n[50] The mother died in childbed, 1746; the father survived until 1780.\r\n\r\n[51] She is said to have been privately married to a singer; but this is\r\ndoubtful. What is certain is that her lovers were as numerous after as\r\nbefore the alleged union.\r\n\r\n[52] The exact expression in Russian is _Matushka_ (little mother), a\r\ntitle of endearment given by the people to the sovereign.\r\n\r\n[53] Prince Theodore Sergeivitch Bariatinski.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII. THE AGE OF CATHERINE THE GREAT\r\n\r\n    We must acknowledge that in many respects Catherine was far\r\n    from irreproachable; her very accession to the throne casts a\r\n    dark shadow on her moral image. But the reproaches that must\r\n    be made to her on this account cannot but be counteracted by\r\n    the thirty-four years of greatness and prosperity which Russia\r\n    enjoyed under her and to which the popular voice has given the\r\n    appellation of the Age of Catherine.--SHEHEBALSKI.[b]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [1762-1796 A.D.]]\r\n\r\nThere are few names so popular in Russia and so dear to her as that\r\nof Catherine II. The generation of men who belonged to her time spoke\r\nof her with the most profound emotion. Memoirs and reminiscences of\r\nher contemporaries breathe almost without exception the same ardent\r\ndevotion--a sort of worship of her. In opposition to these feelings,\r\nforeign reports of her represent her as cruel, heartless, and\r\nunscrupulous to the last degree. Some authors represent her as a sort of\r\nmonster. However strange such contradictions may appear, they can readily\r\nbe accounted for. Foreigners view Catherine II more from the side of her\r\nexternal policy, which was certainly often unsparing and unscrupulous in\r\nthe means employed; they refer caustically to her private life, which\r\nwas certainly not irreproachable. Russians, on the other hand, felt\r\nabove all the influence of her interior administration, which contrasted\r\nsharply from that of her predecessors by its mildness, and which was full\r\nof useful and liberal reforms. The Russians of her day could not remain\r\nindifferent to the glory with which Catherine surrounded Russia. And\r\nthus to the descendants of Catherine, acquainted as they are with the\r\nreports given of her both by Russians and foreigners, she appears as the\r\ntwo-faced god of antiquity; her visage when turned to the neighbouring\r\npowers is stern and unwelcoming; that, on the contrary, which is turned\r\ntoward Russia is full of majesty and mildness.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [1762 A.D.]]\r\n\r\nThe state of affairs was very much entangled when Catherine ascended the\r\nthrone, both in the interior of the empire and in respect to exterior\r\npolicy. One of the first acts of the new empress was the conclusion of\r\npeace with all those who had taken part in the Seven Years’ War. Not\r\nseeing any advantage to Russia in helping the king of Prussia in his war\r\nagainst the German emperor and his allies, Catherine did not consider it\r\nnecessary to assist the latter. “I am of tolerably martial tastes,” said\r\nshe, in the first days after her accession to the throne, to one of the\r\nambassadors to the Russian court, “but I will never begin war without a\r\ncause; if I begin war, it will not be as the empress Elizabeth did--to\r\nplease others, but only when I find it favourable for myself.” These\r\nwords are characteristic of all Catherine’s further foreign policy; to\r\nlisten to them was not without profit for foreign courts, which, during\r\nthe preceding reigns, had certainly been over-spoiled by the complaisance\r\nof the Russians.\r\n\r\nThe next circumstance must have enlightened them still further as\r\nto how little Catherine had the intention of allowing herself to be\r\nrestrained by considerations which did not tend to the furtherance of\r\nthe glory and prosperity of her dominions. We have already seen by what\r\npersistency--sometimes even to the sacrifice of their dignity--the\r\npreceding governments had succeeded in obtaining the recognition of\r\ntheir right to the imperial title. France had recognised it only under\r\nElizabeth, and that under the condition that at all foreign courts the\r\nRussian ambassador must, as previously, yield the precedence to the\r\nFrench ambassador; the late empress Elizabeth herself engaged that this\r\nshould be done. When Catherine came to the throne, it was proposed to\r\nher to renew this engagement; she, however, very decidedly refused to\r\ndo so, and commanded that it should be declared that she would break\r\noff all relations with those courts that did not recognise her in the\r\nquality of empress--a title, she added, which, however, was in no degree\r\nmore exalted than that of the czars. Such were the first acts of the\r\nnew empress in regard to foreign governments: they were bold, firm, and\r\ndetermined.[b]\r\n\r\n\r\nCATHERINE’S OWN VIEWS ON RUSSIA\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [1763 A.D.]]\r\n\r\nThe interior condition of Russia and the position at that time occupied\r\nby Catherine are best described by herself, in her own words. In the\r\nvery beginning of the year 1764 the procurator-general, A. I. Glebov,\r\nwas removed from his functions. As his successor in this weighty and\r\nresponsible office the empress named Prince A. A. Viasemski. The\r\nprocurator-general had to superintend the finances of the empire, to\r\ndirect the senate, and to govern all the interior affairs of the nation,\r\nthus uniting in himself the powers of minister of finance, of justice,\r\nand of home affairs. He was subordinate to none except the law, the good\r\nof the country, and the will of the empress. He was the right hand of\r\nthe empress: “In cases where you may be in doubt,” said Catherine to\r\nhim, “consult with me, and put your trust entirely in God and in me; and\r\nI, seeing how gratifying your conduct is to me, will not forsake you.”\r\nPrince Viasemski was still a young man--he was not yet thirty-seven\r\nyears of age. A pupil of the land-forces cadet corps, he had taken part\r\nin the Prussian War--not, however, in the character of a brave soldier,\r\nbut as the executor of “secret orders.” At the accession of Catherine\r\nto the throne he was already quartermaster-general. In 1763 he was\r\nentrusted with the pacification of the peasants in the eastern provinces\r\nof Russia. He was well educated, industrious, and was recognised by\r\neveryone as an absolutely honest man. It was this last circumstance that\r\ndetermined Catherine’s choice. Having selected for herself her “closest\r\nhelper,” with whom she would have to be in constant relations, the\r\nempress considered it necessary once for all to have a clear explanation\r\nwith him, and with her own hand wrote him “instructions” in which\r\nshe expressed her own views on Russia, on the chief branches of the\r\nadministration, and on herself personally, drawing her portrait for him\r\nas empress:\r\n\r\n“The Russian Empire,” wrote Catherine, “is so vast in its extent that any\r\nother form of government excepting that of an autocratic sovereign would\r\nbe prejudicial to it; for any other would be slow of accomplishment and\r\nwould include in itself a multitude of diverse interests and passions\r\nwhich tend to the weakening of the administrative power. No, there must\r\nbe one sovereign, invested with authority to destroy evil, and who\r\nesteems the public welfare as his own. Other rulers are, in the words of\r\nthe Gospel, hirelings.”\r\n\r\nThe first institution in the empire is the senate. Catherine thus\r\ndescribes it to the young procurator-general: “In the senate you will\r\nfind two parties, but in my opinion a wise policy does not require that\r\nmuch regard should be paid to them, lest too much firmness should thus\r\nbe given them: in this manner they will disappear the sooner; I have\r\nonly kept a watchful eye over them and have used men according to their\r\ncapabilities for one object or another. Both parties will now try to\r\ncatch you for their side. In one you will find men of upright character,\r\nalthough not of far-seeing intellects; in the other I think their views\r\nare wider, but it is not clear whether they are always advantageous.\r\nSome think that because they have been in one or another country for\r\na long time, everything must be arranged in politics for the good of\r\ntheir beloved land, and everything else without exception meets with\r\ntheir criticism, in spite of the fact that all interior administration\r\nis founded on the law of the rights of nations. You must not regard\r\neither one party or the other, but be courteous and dispassionate in your\r\nbehaviour to both, listening to everything, having only the good of the\r\ncountry and justice in view, and walking in firm steps to the shortest\r\nroad to truth.”\r\n\r\nThe senate “by its want of attention to the deeds of certain of my\r\nforefathers left its fundamental principles, and oppressed other courts\r\nthrough which the lower tribunals fell greatly into decline. The\r\nservility and meanness of persons in these tribunals is indescribable and\r\nno good can be expected until this evil is done away with. Only the forms\r\nof bureaucracy are fulfilled, and people do not dare to act uprightly\r\nalthough the interests of the state thus suffer. The senate having once\r\npassed its proper bounds, it is now difficult to accustom it to the\r\nnecessary order in which it should stand. Perhaps for the ambition of\r\nsome members, the former measures have some charm, but at any rate while\r\nI live, it will remain my duty to command.”\r\n\r\nThe “servility” of the members of the government offices was ascribed to\r\nthe senate, but the senate was not to repair the evil it had occasioned.\r\nBy a ukase of the 19th of December, 1763, Catherine required that the\r\n“government offices should be filled by worthy and honest men.” The\r\nmotive of this ukase is explained in the above cited instructions to\r\nPrince Viasemski. In these instructions Catherine draws his attention\r\nto the great burdensomeness for the people of the duties on salt and\r\nwine, but she confides to his particular care the question of silver or\r\ncopper money, which had long interested her, as well as the position\r\nof trade and commerce. “This very delicate matter,” she says, “of which\r\nmany persons find it unpleasant to hear must however be looked into and\r\nexamined by you.” Catherine did not conceal from herself that the laws\r\nrequired amending. “Lack of time alone,” she says, “has prevented the\r\nintroduction of reforms.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: AN OLD MORDVINIAN WOMAN]\r\n\r\nCatherine did not forget to tell the young procurator-general what her\r\nviews were on the frontier country of Russia: “Little Russia, Livonia,\r\nand Finland are provinces that must be governed in conformity with\r\ntheir privileges; to violate them by revoking them all suddenly would\r\nbe quite unseemly, to call them foreign countries, however, and treat\r\nthem on such a basis would be more than an error--it might rightly be\r\ncalled stupidity. These provinces, as also that of Smolensk, must by\r\nthe lightest possible means be gradually russianised so that they shall\r\ncease to be looked upon as wolves in the forest. The attainment of such\r\nan object is quite easy if sensible persons are chosen for the governors\r\nof these provinces. When there is no longer a hetman in Little Russia, we\r\nmust endeavour to abolish even the appellation of hetman.”\r\n\r\nHaving initiated Prince Viasemski into the most secret matters, having\r\nreminded him that a procurator-general in the exercise of his functions\r\nis obliged to oppose the most powerful personages and that therefore the\r\nsovereign power is his only support, Catherine in the following passage\r\nexpressed her views on her own sovereign power:\r\n\r\n“You ought to know with whom you have to do. Occasions will arise daily\r\nwhich will lead you to seek my counsel. You will find that I have no\r\nother aims than the highest welfare and glory of the fatherland and\r\ndesire nothing but the happiness of my subjects of whatever condition\r\nthey may be. My only aspiration is that both within and without my\r\ndominions tranquillity, contentment, and peace should be preserved. I\r\nlove truth above all things, and you may speak it, fearing nothing; I\r\nshall encourage discussion, if good can be accomplished by it. I hear\r\nthat all esteem you as an honest man; I hope to show you by experience\r\nthat persons with such qualities can live happily at court. I will add\r\nthat I require no flattery from you, but solely frankness and sincerity\r\nin your dealings, and firmness in the affairs of state.” Such an\r\nadministration programme and such political principles gave Catherine\r\nfull right to look calmly towards the future.[c]\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE POLISH SUCCESSION; THE POLICY OF THE NATIONS\r\n\r\nA subject of deep gravity soon claimed her attention--the approaching\r\ndeath of the king of Poland and the consequent opening of the succession.\r\nTwo parties were contending for power in Warsaw--the court party with\r\nminister Brühl and his son-in-law Mniszek at its head, and the party\r\nwhich looked to Russia for support and had for chiefs the Czartoriski.\r\nThe first-named faction wished to assure the succession to the prince\r\nof Saxony, an aim in which France and Austria shared, and the second,\r\nplanning to elect a _piast_ or native noble who should belong to their\r\nparty, chose as candidate a nephew of the Czartoriski, Stanislaus\r\nPoniatovski. Thus France, which in 1733 had waged war in the cause of a\r\npiast against the Saxon candidate, now came to support the Saxon against\r\nPoniatovski. The face of affairs had completely changed, and the Polish\r\nmonarchy, growing weaker day by day, arrived at the point where it\r\ncould no longer stand erect save by the aid of Saxony, a German state.\r\nFrederick II had as much reason to dread an increase of power for Saxony\r\nas for Poland, since Saxony was an inveterate enemy of Prussia in the\r\nempire, as was Poland in the regions of the Vistula. Russia, which had\r\nformerly fought against Stanislaus Leszczynski, father-in-law of Louis\r\nXV, was now to oppose the candidate favoured by France and Austria; it\r\nwas eager also to prevent the accession to the throne of any Polish noble\r\nwielding too much power of his own. The choice, therefore, of Stanislaus\r\nPoniatovski, a simple gentleman without personal following or influence,\r\nmet fully the desires of Frederick II, the interests of the Russian\r\nEmpire, and the private feelings of Catherine II, who was happy to bestow\r\na crown upon one of her former lovers.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [1765 A.D.]]\r\n\r\nWhen Augustus III finally died, the diets of convocation and of election\r\nstirred up great agitation all over the country. The two rival parties\r\nwaged fiercer strife than ever; at last the Czartoriski called upon\r\nthe Russian army to help drive out their enemies, and it was under the\r\nprotection of foreign bayonets that Poniatovski inaugurated that fatal\r\nreign during which Poland was to be three times dismembered and in the\r\nend wiped completely from the list of nations. Three principal causes\r\nwere to bring about the ruin of the ancient royal republic:\r\n\r\n(1) The national movement in Russia, which aimed to complete its\r\nterritory on the west and recover, so said its historians, the provinces\r\nwhich had formerly been part of the domain of St. Vladimir, or White\r\nRussia, Black Russia, and Little Russia. With the national question was\r\nmingled another which had already led, under Alexander Mikhailovitch,\r\nto a first dismemberment of the Polish states. Complaints against the\r\noperations of the uniates had multiplied in Lithuania, and Russia had\r\nfrequently attempted to intervene. Peter the Great protested to Augustus\r\nII against the treatment accorded to his co-religionists in Poland, and\r\nAugustus had issued an edict assuring free exercise of the orthodox\r\nreligion; but this never went into effect owing to the inability of the\r\nmonarchy to repress the zeal of the clergy and the Jesuits. In 1723 Peter\r\nbegged the intervention of the pope, but his petition was refused and the\r\nabuses continued.\r\n\r\n(2) The covetousness of Prussia. Poland being in possession of western\r\nPrussia, that is the lower Vistula including Thorn and Dantzic, eastern\r\nPrussia was completely cut off from the rest of the Brandenburg monarchy,\r\nwhich was thus made a divided state. The government of Warsaw committed,\r\nmoreover, the serious error of confounding Protestant and orthodox\r\ndissenters and harassing them alike.\r\n\r\n(3) The inevitable enkindling of Poland in its turn by the spirit of\r\nreform that spread abroad during the eighteenth century. Poniatovski and\r\nthe most enlightened of his countrymen had long perceived the contrast\r\npresented by national anarchy as it prevailed at home and the order\r\nthat was being established in neighbouring states. Nevertheless, while\r\nPrussia, Russia, and Austria were exerting every effort to re-form\r\nthemselves into strictly modern states, Poland still clung obstinately\r\nto the traditions of the feudal ages, and allowed the other European\r\nmonarchies to get so far ahead that when at last the impulse to reform\r\ndid come it hastened the dissolution of the country.\r\n\r\nFrom a social point of view Poland was a nation of agricultural serfs,\r\nabove which had been superimposed a numerous petty nobility that was\r\nitself in bondage to a few great families, against whom even the king\r\nwas powerless. There existed no third estate unless we can designate\r\nby that name a few thousand Catholic bourgeois and a million Jews, who\r\nhad no interest in maintaining a condition of things that condemned\r\nthem to everlasting opprobrium. From an economical point of view the\r\ncountry had only a limited agriculture carried on by serfs after the most\r\nprimitive methods; but little commerce, no industries, and no public\r\nfinances. From a political standpoint the “legal” nation was composed\r\nexclusively of gentleman--rivalry between the great families, anarchy\r\nin the diets, the _liberum veto_, and the inveterate habit of invoking\r\nforeign intervention having destroyed in Poland all idea of law or even\r\nof state. From a military point of view Poland was still in the feudal\r\nstage of undisciplined militia; it had scarcely any organised troops\r\noutside the cavalry formed of nobles, no infantry, but little artillery,\r\nand no fortresses worthy the name on frontiers that were thus left open\r\nto the enemy. What means of defence had a nation divided against itself,\r\nguilty of having received gold from the enemy, against the three powerful\r\nmonarchies which beset it on all sides, and whose ambassadors had more\r\npower than its own king in his diets?\r\n\r\nCatherine and Frederick were agreed on two essential points: to vindicate\r\nthe rights of dissenters and prevent any reform in the anarchial\r\nconstitution which made Poland their easy prey. By affecting to espouse\r\nthe cause of tolerance they could blind Europe to their real designs\r\nagainst the integrity of the country, and Poland’s own noisy fanaticism\r\nwould further enable them to conceal their object.\r\n\r\nIn 1765 Koninski, an orthodox bishop of White Russia, presented a memoir\r\nto the king of Poland in which were recounted all the vexations which the\r\nfollowers of the Greek religion had been made to suffer in his kingdom.\r\n“The missionary fathers,” said the memoir, “were particularly remarkable\r\nfor their zeal; upheld by the secular authorities they were in the habit\r\nof summoning all the Greco-Russian inhabitants of the villages and\r\nbanding them together like a flock of sheep six weeks at a time, forcing\r\nthem to confess, and displaying thorny rods and stakes to intimidate\r\nthe rebellious, separating children from their parents and wives from\r\nhusbands. In case of stubborn resistance the recalcitrant ones were\r\nseverely beaten, their hands were burned, or they were confined in prison\r\nfor several months.”\r\n\r\nRussia supported the dissenters in the Polish diet and Stanislaus\r\npromised to sustain them. To do this it was necessary to assure to\r\nthe people the free exercise of their religion, and to the nobles the\r\npolitical rights of which they had been despoiled under preceding\r\nlegislators. The diet of 1766 violently opposed this proposition, and\r\nthe deputy Gourovski who had tried to speak in favour of the dissenters\r\nnarrowly escaped assassination.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [1767-1768 A.D.]]\r\n\r\nRepnin, Catherine’s ambassador, urged the dissenters to resort to the\r\nlegal method of confederation. Those of the orthodox faith united at\r\nSluth, the Protestants, under the patronage of the Prussian ambassador,\r\nat Thorn; even at Radom there was a confederation of Catholics and of all\r\nthose who feared a reform in the constitution or the abolition of the\r\n_liberum veto_. Russia, which with Prussia had guaranteed the support\r\nof this absurd constitution, took these also under its protection. Such\r\nwere the auspices under which was opened the diet of 1767; the Poles\r\nseemed insensible to the attack made on their independence and exerted\r\nthemselves solely to maintain intolerance. Soltik, bishop of Cracow,\r\nZaluski, bishop of Kiev, and two other of the pope’s ambassadors were the\r\nmost ardent in opposing the project of reform. Repnin had them seized and\r\ncarried to Russia, and so persistently had Poland shown herself in the\r\nwrong that Europe applauded an act, in itself a violation of the rights\r\nof men, which seemed to assure liberty of conscience. The diet yielded\r\nand consented to the dissenting nobles being granted equal rights with\r\nthe Catholics; in any case the state religion was to remain that of Rome.\r\n\r\n\r\nPOLAND IS DISMEMBERED\r\n\r\nIn 1768 a treaty was drawn up between Poland and Russia by the terms\r\nof which no modification could be made in the constitution without the\r\nconsent of the latter power. This was equivalent to legalising foreign\r\nintervention, from the abuse of which Poland was to perish. The Russian\r\ntroops evacuated Warsaw, and the confederates sent deputies to render\r\nthanks to the empress.\r\n\r\nThe Radom Confederation, the most considerable of the three, which had\r\ntaken up arms solely to prevent reforms in the constitution, not to\r\nsupport the dissenters, was gravely dissatisfied with the result. On its\r\ndissolution another and still more numerous confederation was formed,\r\nthat of Bar in Podolia, which had for object the maintenance of the\r\n_liberum veto_ and the securing of exclusive privileges to Catholics. It\r\nsent deputies to the courts of Dresden, Vienna, and Versailles to awaken\r\ninterest in its cause. In the west opinions differed; on which side were\r\nright, the Polish nation, the brightest promise for the future? Were they\r\nat Warsaw with the king, the senate, and all those who had striven for\r\nthe enfranchisement of the dissenters and the reconstruction of Poland,\r\nor were they at Bar with the turbulent nobles who, guided by fanatical\r\npriests, had revolted in the name of the _liberum veto_ and religious\r\nintolerance? Voltaire and most of the French philosophers declared for\r\nthe king; but the minister of Louis XV, Monsieur de Choiseul, favoured\r\nthe confederates, without taking into consideration that in weakening\r\nthe power of the Polish king he was weakening Poland itself. The royal\r\narmy consisting of only nine thousand men, the government committed the\r\ngrievous blunder of calling upon Russia for aid, and the result was that\r\nthe Muscovite troops succeeded in recapturing from the confederates Bar,\r\nBerdichev, and Cracow. The Cossacks of the Ukraine, the Zaparogians and\r\nthe laïdamaks or brigands were called to arms and a savage war, at once\r\nnational, religious, and social, ensued, desolating the provinces of\r\nthe Dnieper. The massacre of Ouman, a town belonging to Count Potocki,\r\nhorrified the inhabitants of the Ukraine.\r\n\r\nThe confederates obtained the support of the Viennese court and\r\nestablished a council at Teschen, and their headquarters at Eperies,\r\nin Hungary. They were still in possession of three strongholds in\r\nPoland. Choiseul sent them money and commissioned successively De\r\nTaules, Dumouriez, and the baron de Viomesnil to assist in their\r\norganisation. From the memoirs of Dumouriez we learn that the forces\r\nof the confederation, distributed about over all Poland, consisted of\r\nsixteen thousand cavalry divided into five or six separate bands, each\r\ncommanded by an independent chief. Dumouriez with his undisciplined\r\ntroops was defeated at Landskron (1771); but Viomesnil, Dussaillans, and\r\nChoisy became masters of the château of Cracow (1772), which was finally\r\nrecovered by Souvorov. An attempt made by certain confederates on the\r\n3rd of November, 1771, to obtain possession of the person of the king,\r\nexcited noisy but insincere indignation at the three northern courts, and\r\nincreased Voltaire’s aversion to the confederates.[d]\r\n\r\nBy the treaty of St. Petersburg (signed August 5th, 1772), the\r\npalatinates of Malborg, Pomerania, Warmia, Culm (except Dantzic and\r\nThorn), and part of Great Poland was ceded to Prussia. Austria had\r\nGalicia, Sandomir, Cracow, and part of Podolia. Russia had Polotsk,\r\nVitepsk, Mikislav, and Polish Livonia. The next point was to execute the\r\ntreaty. A pretext could not long be wanting for the armed interference\r\nof all the three powers: each had been expressly invited by some one of\r\nthe parties which divided that unhappy country, which were perpetually\r\nengaged in civil war. The three bandit chiefs despatched armies into\r\nPoland, and Europe waited with much anxiety the issue of this step. Its\r\nsuspense was not of long continuance: the Treaty of St. Petersburg was\r\npresented to the Polish king and senate; and manifestoes, stating the\r\npretensions of each power, were published.\r\n\r\nNever were documents so insulting laid before rational men. King and\r\nsenate could oppose little resistance to demands so powerfully supported;\r\nbut their consent alone could not sanction the dismemberment of the\r\nrepublic. Hence the diet was convoked. That eight or ten members only\r\nshould resist the destruction of their country, that all the rest should\r\ntamely sanction it, might appear incredible if it were not a matter of\r\nhistory. In this monstrous robbery the lion’s share fell to Russia. She\r\nacquired an extent of territory estimated at 3,440 square leagues, with\r\none million and a half of inhabitants: Austria had 2,700 leagues, but a\r\ngreater population, _viz._ two millions and a half: Prussia had scarcely\r\n1,000 square leagues, and less than a million of people.\r\n\r\nAs the three co-robbers were so courageous as to set at defiance both\r\njustice and public opinion, so magnanimous as to show themselves in\r\ntheir real character to all posterity, it may appear matter of surprise\r\nthat they did not seize on the whole of the kingdom. But though they had\r\nresolved to seize the remainder, they were cautious enough to await the\r\ncourse of events--to take advantage of any favourable circumstance that\r\nmight arise. The French Revolution furnished them with it. That event\r\nhad many admirers in Poland, many who wished to imitate it at home.\r\nIt was easy for the three neighbouring powers to take umbrage at the\r\nprogress of republican opinions; to assert, as indeed truth authorised\r\nthem to assert, that the Poles were in communication with the heads of\r\nthe movement in Paris. In reality, in the year 1791 a new constitution\r\nwas proclaimed, exceedingly like a republic. The reduction of Dantzic\r\nand Thorn, the two most important possessions in the north of Europe,\r\nconvinced the Poles that they had been duped. Catherine was not a woman\r\nto let others derive the sole advantage where anything was to be gained.\r\nPreparatory to active operations, she declared war against Poland. The\r\ndiet resolved to resist; but, as usual, the Poles were divided among\r\nthemselves. One party declared for Russia; and though the greater\r\nnumber declared for independence, they could not be brought to combine.\r\nSuccess after success was obtained by the Russian general; the empress\r\nnegotiated the details of another partition with Prussia; and the king\r\nand the diet were, as before, compelled to sanction it. By it the Russian\r\nfrontier was extended to the centre of Lithuania and Volhinia; while the\r\nremainder of Great and a part of Little Poland were ceded to Frederick\r\nWilliam. Much to the honour of Austria, she had no hand in this second\r\niniquity.\r\n\r\nThe territory of the republic was now reduced to about 4,000 square\r\nmiles; and her army, by command of the czarina, was in future not to\r\nexceed fifteen thousand men. The Poles were never deficient in bravery;\r\nand they were, on this occasion, sensitive to the national shame. They\r\nfelt that the narrow limits still allowed them would soon be passed, and\r\nthat their remaining provinces were intended soon to be incorporated\r\nwith the neighbouring states. A general insurrection was organised;\r\nan army voluntarily arose, and Kosciuszko placed himself at its head.\r\nFor a time wonders were wrought by the patriots; though opposed by two\r\ngreat enemies--Russia and Prussia--they expelled the enemy from most of\r\nthe fortresses; and even when Austria acceded to the coalition and took\r\nCracow they were not desponding. To effect impossibilities, however,\r\nwas an absurd attempt: the majority felt it to be so, and they sullenly\r\nreceived the foreign law. Kosciuszko was made prisoner; the last outworks\r\nof the last fortress were reduced; Warsaw capitulated; Stanislaus\r\nwas deposed; and a third partition ended the existence of the Polish\r\nRepublic. By it Austria had Cracow, with the country between the Pilitza,\r\nthe Vistula, and the Bug. Prussia had Warsaw, with the territory to the\r\nbanks of the Niemen. The rest, which, as usual, was the lion’s share,\r\nfell to Russia.\r\n\r\n\r\n_War with Turkey (1769-1774 A.D.)_\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [1769 A.D.]]\r\n\r\nThe wars with this power occupied a considerable portion of Catherine’s\r\nreign; yet they were not originally sought by her. The Porte, at the\r\nsuggestion of the French ambassador, whose master was anxious to divert\r\nher from her meditated encroachments on Poland, was, unfortunately for\r\nitself, induced to declare war against her. The Grand Seignior, indeed,\r\nwas the ally of the republic; and he was one of the parties to guarantee\r\nits independence. But his dominions were not tranquil; the discipline of\r\nhis armies was impaired, while that of the Russians was improving every\r\nday. Perhaps, however, he was ignorant of the disadvantages which must\r\nattend the prosecution of the war: certainly his pride was flattered by\r\nthe insinuation that he held in his hands the balance of power in eastern\r\nand northern Europe. In 1769 hostilities commenced by the invasion of the\r\nCrimea, the khan of which was the vassal of the Porte. Azov and Taganrog\r\nwere soon taken; Moldavia was entered; Servia was cleared of the Tatar\r\nallies. Before Kotzim, however, Prince Galitzin received a check, and\r\nwas forced to repass the Dniester. A second attempt on that important\r\nfortress was equally unsuccessful. But the Turks, who pursued too far,\r\nwere vanquished in some isolated engagement; and the campaign of 1769\r\nended by the acquisition of Kotzim.\r\n\r\nThe operations of the following year were much more decisive. Galitzin,\r\ndisgusted by the arrogance of the favourite Orlov, resigned the command\r\ninto abler hands than even his own--those of Count Romanzov. The\r\nreduction of Jassy and Brailov was preparatory to two great victories,\r\nwhich rendered the name of Romanzov forever memorable in the annals of\r\nhis country. The first was on the banks of the Pruth. The Turks, in\r\nnumber eighty thousand, under the khan of the Crimea, were intrenched on\r\na hill, in a position too strong to be assailed. But after three weeks,\r\nthey became wearied of their inactivity; and believing, from a feint\r\nof the Russian general, that he was about to retire, twenty thousand\r\nof them rushed down the hill. They were repulsed with terrible loss;\r\nthe remainder carried dismay into the camp; and the Russians, taking\r\nadvantage of the circumstances, ascended, forced the intrenchments,\r\nkilled many, compelled the rest to flee, and seized considerable booty,\r\nwith thirty-eight pieces of cannon. Retreating towards the Danube, the\r\nTurks effected a junction with the grand vizir, whose army was thereby\r\nincreased to 150,000.\r\n\r\nUnaware of its extent, Romanzov pursued with ardour, and was suddenly in\r\nthe presence of his formidable competitor. His position was a critical\r\none. The vizir was intrenched; and the khan, resolved to efface the shame\r\nof his recent defeat, wheeled round his left flank, and encamped behind\r\nhim. Hence he could not move backwards or forwards. On the following day\r\nthe vizir gave the signal of battle; and the contest raged for some hours\r\nwith desperate fury. Annoyed at the perpetual discharges of the enemy’s\r\nartillery, which alarmingly thinned his ranks, the count ordered his men\r\nto fix their bayonets and rush on the intrenchments. Here the struggle\r\nwas more deadly than before; but in the end numbers yielded to discipline\r\nand valour. The Turks fled, the vizir with them, leaving immense stores\r\n(among which were 143 pieces of cannon) in the power of the victors,\r\nand nearly one-third of their number on the field. Romanzov now crossed\r\nthe Dniester; one of his generals, Repnin, reduced Ismailov; the other,\r\nPanin, took the most important fortress, Bender, after a siege of three\r\nmonths; while a detachment from the main army seized the capital of\r\nBessarabia.\r\n\r\nNor were these the only successes of the year. Not satisfied with warfare\r\non land, Catherine resolved to try her fortunes on the deep; and to do\r\nwhat none of her predecessors had ever dreamed--to send a powerful fleet\r\ninto the Mediterranean, for the purpose of assailing her enemy in Greece.\r\nMany new ships were built; many English naval officers persuaded to\r\ncommand them, and to teach her seamen the arts by which the superiority\r\nof England had been so long maintained. The Greeks were impatient for\r\nthe arrival of their co-religionists; the czarina’s gold had gained over\r\nthe chiefs, and a general insurrection of the people was meditated. Her\r\ndesigns were truly gigantic--no less than to drive the Mohammedans from\r\nEurope. The fleet sailed, arrived in the Archipelago, disembarked both\r\non the islands and the continent; and while the Turkish possessions were\r\nassailed on the Danube, they were equally perilled in these southern\r\nlatitudes.\r\n\r\nA terrible warfare now commenced--the Greeks everywhere butchering the\r\nMohammedans, the latter retaliating. A naval battle was inevitable; the\r\nhostile fleets met between Scio and Natolia: the engagement continued\r\nuntil night, to the manifest advantage of the Russians. That very night\r\nthe Turkish admiral was so foolish as to run his ships into a narrow\r\nbay, in which he was instantly blockaded. Some fire-ships, sent by\r\nVice-Admiral Elphinstone, a Scotchman in the service of the empress,\r\nset all of them on fire; and at sunrise the following morning not a\r\nflag was to be seen. This blow sensibly affected the Turks, especially\r\nas the appearance of the Russians in the Mediterranean had encouraged\r\nTripoli, Egypt, and Syria to rebel against the Porte. Ali Bey, the\r\ngovernor of Egypt, an able, ambitious, and enterprising insurgent, was\r\nready to assist his allies with all his might; but the incapacity yet\r\negregious haughtiness of the Russian admiral, Alexis Orlov, prevented\r\nthem from deriving much advantage from the union. The year, however, was\r\none of brilliant success; and Catherine was so elated that she built\r\na magnificent palace, which she called after the bay in which the last\r\nvictory was gained.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [1771-1774 A.D.]]\r\n\r\nIn the spring of 1771, Orlov again resorted to the Mediterranean,\r\nwhere the Russian fleet still lay, with the intention of forcing the\r\nDardanelles; while the armies on the Danube renewed their operations. The\r\nposition of Turkey was, indeed, critical: not only was one-half of the\r\nempire in revolt, but the plague had alarmingly thinned the population.\r\nFortunately, however, for this power, the same scourge found its way\r\ninto the heart of Russia: its ravages were as fatal at Moscow as at\r\nConstantinople; and it no more spared the Christians on the Danube than\r\nit did the Mohammedans. This calamity slackened, but did not suspend\r\noperations. If the Russians were sometimes repulsed, the balance of\r\nsuccess was decidedly in their favour. The famous lines of Perekop, from\r\nthe Euxine to the sea of Azov were forced by Prince Dolgoruki, though\r\nthey were defended by fifty thousand Tatars; the whole of the Crimea,\r\none fortress excepted, was subdued; and the surname of Krimski, or\r\nConqueror of the Crimea, was given to the victor. The country, however,\r\nwas not incorporated with the empire: on the contrary, while it was\r\ndeclared independent of the Porte, it was proclaimed as merely under\r\nthe protection of Russia. The khan, Selim Girai, being thus expelled,\r\nproceeded to Constantinople, where he died. The exertions of the fleet,\r\nhowever, did not correspond with those of the land forces: all that Orlov\r\neffected was to destroy the Turkish commerce on the Levant.\r\n\r\nDuring the year 1772 no hostilities were committed, and negotiations for\r\npeace were undertaken. Though the two contracting parties, which sent\r\ntheir representatives to Bucharest, could not agree on the conditions,\r\nboth were anxious to recruit their strength, after the heavy losses\r\nthey had sustained both by the sword and the plague. Catherine too had\r\nanother motive for temporary inaction; she was busily effecting the first\r\npartition of Poland. With the return of the following spring, however,\r\nthe banks of the Danube were again the theatre of war; but this campaign\r\nwas not destined to be so glorious as the one of 1771. Its opening was\r\nunfavourable for the Russians: while a body of fourteen thousand, under\r\nPrince Repnin, were crossing that river, they were surprised by one\r\nof the Turkish generals; many perished; about six hundred, with the\r\nprince himself, were made prisoners and sent to Constantinople. Shortly\r\nafterwards, Romanzov who had passed that river and was marching on\r\nSilistria, was compelled to retrace his steps. At Roskana a considerable\r\nbody of his troops was defeated by the vizir. This harassing warfare--for\r\nthe Turks carefully avoided a general action--thinned the ranks and, what\r\nis worse, depressed the spirits of the invaders. Romanzov was no less\r\naverse to such a risk. Nor did the fleet in the Mediterranean effect\r\nanything to counterbalance their indecisive yet destructive operations.\r\nWhat little advantage there was belonged to the Turks.\r\n\r\nThe campaign of 1774 promised to be more important than the preceding;\r\nand the Porte, from the rebellion of Pugatchev, was confident of success.\r\nSeveral actions on the Danube, which, however bravely contested, led\r\nto no result, were yet considered as indicative of a severe if not a\r\ndecisive struggle. But the anticipation was groundless. Though several\r\nbodies of Tatars, who were to effect a diversion in favour of Pugatchev,\r\nwere defeated; though the Danube was crossed; though twenty-five thousand\r\nof the Turks were repulsed by Soltikov, and another body still stronger\r\nby Suvarov, though the vizir himself was blockaded in Shumla--Europe was\r\ndisappointed in its expectations; for negotiations were opened for a\r\npeace which was soon concluded.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Treaty of Kutchuk-Kainardji (1774 A.D.)_\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [1774 A.D.]]\r\n\r\nBy the Treaty of Kutchuk-Kainardji (July, 1774) Russia obtained the free\r\nnavigation of the Black Sea, the right of passage through the Danube,\r\na large tract of land between the Bug and the Dnieper, with the strong\r\nfortresses of Azov, Taganrog, Kertch, and Kinburn. The rest of the\r\nCrimea was ceded--not, indeed, to the Turks, but to its own khan, who,\r\nthough declared independent, must of necessity be the creature of the\r\nempress, in whose hands those fortresses remained. They were the keys to\r\nhis dominions, and even to the command of the Black Sea. A sum of money\r\nsufficient to defray the expenses of the war was also stipulated; but\r\nit was never paid. The advantages which Russia derived from the other\r\narticles were ample enough: among them, not the least, was the commerce\r\nof the Levant and of the Black Sea.[e]\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE MIGRATION OF THE KALMUCKS\r\n\r\nIt seemed as if Catherine’s reign was destined to be marked by the most\r\nextraordinary events, and one of them was this simultaneous departure of\r\na horde variously estimated at from three hundred thousand to six hundred\r\nthousand Tatars, an example at the end of the eighteenth century of one\r\nof those great migratory movements which history never expected again to\r\nrecord. Catherine was humiliated with having to furnish the example; it\r\nwas in too striking contrast with that happiness which her philosophic\r\nfriends said the human race enjoyed in her empire; and the peaceful\r\nmigration of an indignant and angry people gave the formal lie to all\r\nthe praises loud shouted by philanthropy. Our readers will not regret to\r\nfind here were details of this unexpected event which suddenly made in\r\nthe Russian Empire an empty spot, more than fifteen hundred versts in\r\nlength, between Tzaritsin and Astrakhan. These Tatars, known under the\r\nname of Kalmucks, were originally included in three principal tribes. At\r\nfirst subject to China, they had been frequently at war either with it or\r\nwith themselves. One of their khans, Amusanan, defeated and pursued by\r\nthe Chinese, had taken refuge at Tobolsk in Siberia, where he died about\r\n1757. These troubles, whose origin dated back more than sixty years, had\r\nin 1696 caused a great number of Kalmucks of the three tribes to reunite,\r\nquit a country devastated by constant war, and seek new homes at the\r\neastern extremity of the Russian Empire.\r\n\r\nThey settled or located themselves in a vast stretch of territory\r\nclose to the Caspian Sea, between the Ural and the Volga. The Chinese\r\nclaimed that according to some ancient treaties Russia had to return all\r\nfugitive subjects, but received no reply except that there was nothing to\r\nprevent a wandering people from settling in waste places, a reply which\r\nseventy-five years later the Chinese made use of on their own part with\r\nadvantage. Russia received these fugitive hordes and did not delay in\r\ngetting service out of them. Another Tatar nation composed principally\r\nof Lesghians, who lived beyond Kisliar and were greedy for pillage,\r\nmade frequent incursions into the empire and depopulated the border by\r\nthe quantity of slaves they brought back with them. The new Kalmucks\r\nwere charged with keeping them out and performed the duty if not with\r\nconstant success, at least with a fidelity which did them great credit.\r\nThe government felt that this permanent defence was more advantageous to\r\nit than a contribution necessarily small and hard to collect would be;\r\nand consequently, guided a long time by this wise principle, it contented\r\nitself with taking annually from the Kalmucks a certain number of men\r\nand horses for the light cavalry; but when once it deviated from a rule\r\nwhich it should never have broken, troubles began and the cupidity of its\r\nagents multiplied particular iniquities under pretext of collecting for\r\nthe public funds. The Russian governors and even the minor officials were\r\nconfirmed in the belief that everything was permitted them because they\r\nwere sure that everything would be ignored.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A KALMUCK WOMAN]\r\n\r\nSeveral of the Kalmuck chiefs were treated with indignity. It was\r\nestablished as a state maxim that they had no right to complain against\r\ninjustice; all protest was regarded as a crime. Finally the khan Ubashi,\r\nalive to his people’s misfortunes and wretched himself through the\r\npride and rapacity of his oppressors who had taken his only son from\r\nhim, dared to draw a picture of his sad position and wished to present\r\nit at St. Petersburg. But all means of getting there were closed to\r\nhim. This attempt only aggravated his fate and vengeance was now added\r\nto oppression. Here is exhibited a truly interesting spectacle. This\r\nnumerous people who, by joining the Lesghians, could, especially in the\r\ncondition that Russia then was, give it the greatest alarm and mete out\r\nterrible retaliation, had no thought of using force. They had come to\r\nseek peace and had been deprived of it, so they withdrew. They withdrew\r\nwithout making use of arms, at least none but what they were forced to by\r\nthe necessity of defending themselves and of procuring what they stood in\r\nneed of for themselves and their large herds in occupying a front about\r\none hundred leagues wide over a route nearly twelve hundred leagues in\r\nlength.\r\n\r\nThe preparations for this journey were made with a secrecy which\r\nconcealed them from Russia’s knowledge. A nomadic people travels with no\r\nother equipment than its herds, which furnish its drink and a portion\r\nof its nourishment. Obliged often to change locality in order to obtain\r\ngrazing grounds, it might without arousing suspicion creep nearer and\r\nnearer the frontiers and even cross them without being stopped by\r\ndetachments sent in pursuit. This is what happened. The preparations were\r\nfurthered by the Ural Cossacks, who had experienced the same troubles\r\nwith Russian officials and who were shortly to rise in open rebellion\r\nunder Pugatchev. Furthermore the migration was carried out like all those\r\nof northeastern peoples--with this difference, however: the others came\r\nto Europe to invade realms and destroy and replace the inhabitants; while\r\nthis one was returning to its ancestral home to reunite itself to the\r\nempire it had left at the end of the preceding century. In fact, while\r\nall known migrations have taken place from the northeast and east to the\r\nwest and south, this is the single exception which retrograded from west\r\nto east.\r\n\r\nIt divided itself into several columns in order to have sufficient\r\nstretch of territory to pasture the herds, and the first column left\r\nthe Volga on the 16th of December, 1770. This prodigious assemblage of\r\nmen, women, and children, formed of more than eighty thousand families\r\nand taking with it an immense number of cattle, was after a few days\r\non the march vainly attacked by the Russians, continued its journey,\r\nwas sometimes obliged to use force in making its way, and on the 9th of\r\nAugust appeared in the Elenth country on the borders of China near the\r\nriver Obi. Its progress may be calculated at about five leagues per day,\r\na rate that seems almost incredible when one thinks of all that composed\r\nthe body. They also had with them as prisoners a hundred Russian soldiers\r\nas well as an officer named Dudun who had commanded them, who is believed\r\nto have been French. It was indeed a strange destiny for this officer to\r\nbe brought to China as the slave of a Kalmuck!\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Kalmucks Reach China_\r\n\r\nUbashi, shortly after leaving the Volga, had informed the Chinese of\r\nthe migration; and precautions were taken in advance that the arrival\r\nof such an enormous crowd should occasion no disorder. The emperor of\r\nChina erected forts and redoubts in the most important places to watch\r\nthe passing carefully and collect the necessary provisions. The Kalmucks,\r\nreceived like old subjects, found on arriving provision for clothing,\r\nfood, and shelter. They were worn out by fatigue and in an extremely\r\nragged condition. They had made their way north of the Caspian Sea, one\r\ndivision skirted the borders of Siberia to gain the fertile banks of the\r\nIrtish, the other kept farther south near the Usben country in order to\r\nreach that of the Elenths without crossing the Kobi desert, where no\r\nsustenance would have been found.\r\n\r\nThey lost on the way more than a third of their number by fatigue, by\r\nsickness, and in the battles they were frequently obliged to wage,\r\nespecially against the wandering Tatars. They were but four hundred\r\nthousand on arriving. To each family was assigned a piece of ground\r\nsuitable as much for pasturage as for agriculture, to which the\r\ngovernment desired that they should devote themselves--an efficient means\r\nof fixing a people and attaching it to the soil which it cultivates.\r\nUbashi appeared at court and was received with honour. Twenty thousand\r\nother Tatar families who had accompanied Amusanan in his flight or were\r\ndispersed along the Siberian frontiers followed the example of the Tatars\r\nof the Volga, and returned to their old homes. The Chinese government\r\nseemed truly paternal in greeting these children whose long misfortunes\r\nfinally brought them back to their ancestral homes.\r\n\r\nCatherine on learning of their departure became justly indignant against\r\nthe Russian officials who by force of bad treatment had pushed the\r\nKalmucks to this extremity; but the wrong was done, and it was impossible\r\nto right it. As soon as she knew what route they had taken she took\r\nmeasures to have the Peking government send them back. The emperor\r\nreplied that these people were returning to their old homes, that he\r\ncould not refuse them an asylum, and for the rest if she wished to know\r\nthe reason of their flight she had only to ask those who had overwhelmed\r\nthese people, their chiefs, and even their khan with outrages and\r\ninjustices. Catherine, despairing of bringing them back, was obliged to\r\nmake use of several bodies of light troops to protect the frontiers the\r\nKalmucks had recently left.[f]\r\n\r\n\r\nINSURRECTIONS AND PRETENDERS\r\n\r\nA riot in Moscow having clearly revealed the depths of barbarism in which\r\nwere still plunged the lower classes of the capital--the domestic serfs,\r\nlackeys, and factory-workers; the insurrection headed by Pugatchev will\r\nshow what elements of disorder were still fermenting in the most remote\r\nprovinces of the empire. The peasants upon whom fell the whole burden of\r\nstate charges, as well as the exactions of proprietors and functionaries,\r\ndreamed in their ignorance of all sorts of impossible changes, and were\r\nalways ready to follow impostors; many were the false Peters and Ivans\r\nand Pauls who started up with worthless claims to trade on the credulity\r\nof these simple minds, deeply imbued as they were with the distrust\r\nof “women on the throne.” The raskolniks, made savage and fanatical\r\nby previous persecutions, remained in their forests on the Volga,\r\nirreconcilable enemies of this second Roman empire that was stained with\r\nthe blood of so many martyrs. The Cossacks of the Don and the Zaparogians\r\nof the Dnieper chafed under a yoke to which they were unused, and the\r\npagan, Mussulman, or orthodox tribes of the Volga were but awaiting an\r\nopportunity to regain their former liberty and retake the lands occupied\r\nby the Russians.\r\n\r\nHow little these various ungovernable elements could accommodate\r\nthemselves to the conditions of a modern state has been shown, when,\r\nin 1770, three hundred thousand of the Kalmuck-Turguts abandoned their\r\nencampments. Add to these malcontents a crowd of vagabonds of all sorts,\r\nruined nobles, unfrocked monks, fugitive serfs, and pirates of the Volga,\r\nand it will be seen that Russia contained in its eastern portion all the\r\nmaterials necessary for an immense _jacquerie_, such as had before been\r\nunchained by the false Dmitri, or Stenka Radzin.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A BOKHARIAN OF SIBERIA]\r\n\r\nIt was the Cossacks of the Jaik, cruelly repressed after their\r\ninsurrection in 1766, who were to provide the rebel serfs with a leader\r\nin the person of Emilian Pugatchev, a raskolnik who had escaped from\r\nprison to Siberia. Passing himself off as Peter III, who had been rescued\r\nfrom the hands of the executioner, he raised the banner of the Holsteins\r\nand declared his intention of marching on St. Petersburg to punish his\r\nwife and place his son on the throne. With a following of but three\r\nhundred men he laid siege to the little fortress of Jaik. All the troops\r\nthat were sent against him passed over to his side. He caused all the\r\nofficers to be hanged, and put to death all the nobles in the towns\r\nthrough which he passed, capturing by means of such terrorisation several\r\nsmall fortresses on the steppes. By his intimates who knew the secret\r\nof his origin, he was treated in private as a simple Cossack, but the\r\npopulations were deceived and received him with the ringing of bells.\r\nCertain Polish confederates who were captives in these regions organised\r\nfor him a body of artillery. For nearly a year he kept Kazan and Orenburg\r\nin a state of terror, defeating all the generals that were sent against\r\nhim. Peasants began to rise against the nobles, Tatars and other tribes\r\nagainst the Russians, until the bitterest of social wars was unchained\r\nin the whole Volga basin. Moscow with its one hundred thousand serfs was\r\nthrown into agitation; among the lower classes there was talk of liberty\r\nand extermination of the masters. Catherine II charged Alexander Bibikov\r\nto check the progress of sedition.\r\n\r\nBibikov was aghast, on arriving at Kazan, to see the extent of the\r\ndemoralisation. He set about reassuring the nobles and soothing the\r\nlower classes, but in letters to his wife he wrote: “Conditions are\r\nfrightful, I fear all will go ill!” Without great confidence in his\r\nown troops he decided to attack the impostor, whom he recognised as\r\nmerely an instrument in the hands of the Cossacks. He defeated Pugatchev\r\ntwice, once at Tatistchev and once at Kargula, dispersing his army and\r\nseizing his cannon. Bibikov died in the full flush of victory, but his\r\nlieutenants, Michelson, Collongues, and Galitzin, continued to pursue\r\nthe vanquished pretender. Hunted to the lower Volga, Pugatchev suddenly\r\nascended the river and pillaged and burned Kazan, but was afterwards\r\ndefeated on the Kazanka. Descending the river he entered Saransk, Samara,\r\nand Tsaritsin, and though hotly pursued by his enemies took time to\r\nestablish there new municipalities. Meanwhile the populations on the\r\nroute to Moscow were awaiting his coming, and to meet this expectation\r\ninnumerable Peter III’s and Pugatchevs arose, who at the head of furious\r\nbands went about assassinating proprietors and burning châteaux. It\r\nwas high time that Pugatchev should be brought to justice. Tracked\r\ndown between the Volga and the Jaik by Michelson and the indefatigable\r\nSuvarov, he was taken to Moscow, where the people were given the\r\nspectacle of his execution.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [1775 A.D.]]\r\n\r\nThese troubles had been a warning to Catherine II, and she still bore\r\nthem in mind when she destroyed the Zaparogian Republic in 1775. The\r\nvaliant tribes of the Dnieper, expulsed under Peter the Great and\r\nrecalled under Anna Ivanovna, no longer recognised their former territory\r\nof Ukraine. Southern Russia, freed from the incursions of the Tatars,\r\nwas rapidly being colonised; cities were springing up on all sides and\r\nthe vast herb-covered steppes were becoming transformed into cultivated\r\nfields. The Zaparogians were highly displeased at the transformation, and\r\nwished to have their lands restored to them in their former condition.\r\nThey protected the _haïdamaks_ who were constantly harassing the\r\ncolonists, until Potemkin, the actual creator of “new” Russia, wearied\r\nof such uncomfortable neighbours, occupied on the empress’ order the\r\n_sitcha_ and destroyed it. The malcontents fled for refuge to the lands\r\nof the sultan; the rest were organised into the Cossacks of the Black\r\nSea, and in 1792 the island of Phanagoria and the southern shore of the\r\nsea of Azov were assigned to them as residence. Such was the end of the\r\ngreat Cossack uprising which is heard of to-day only in the songs of the\r\n_kobzars_.[d]\r\n\r\n\r\nFAVOURITISM UNDER CATHERINE II\r\n\r\nDuring the reign of Catherine favouritism attained a very wide\r\ndevelopment. In her _Memoirs_[g] we meet with the following\r\ncharacteristic passage which is not devoid of interest: “I was endowed by\r\nnature with great sensitiveness, and an exterior which if not beautiful\r\nwas, nevertheless, attractive; I pleased from the first moment and did\r\nnot require to employ for this purpose artifice or embellishments. By\r\nnature my soul was of such a sociable character that always when anyone\r\nhad spent a quarter of an hour with me, he felt perfectly at ease and\r\ncould converse with me as if he had known me for a long time. By my\r\nnatural indulgence I inspired confidence in those that had to do with\r\nme; because everyone was aware that nothing was pleasanter to me than to\r\nact benevolently and with the strictest honesty. I may venture to say\r\n(if I may be allowed thus to speak of myself) that I was like a knight\r\nof liberty and lawfulness; I had rather the soul of a man than that of a\r\nwoman; but there was nothing repellent in this, for to the intellect and\r\ncharacter of a man was united in me the charm of a most amiable woman. I\r\ntrust I may be pardoned these words and expressions of my self-love: I\r\nuse them counting them as true, and not desiring to screen myself by any\r\nfalse modesty.\r\n\r\n“I have said that I pleased; consequently half of the temptation that\r\narises is already included in that fact itself; the other half in such\r\ncases naturally follows from the very essence of human nature, because\r\nto be subjected to temptation and to yield to it are very near to each\r\nother. Although the very highest principles of morality may be impressed\r\non the mind, yet they soon become involved, and feelings appear which\r\nlead one immeasurably further than one thinks. For my part even until now\r\nI do not know how they can be averted. People perhaps may say that there\r\nis one means--flight; but there are cases, positions, circumstances where\r\nflight is impossible; in fact where can one flee to, where seek a refuge,\r\nwhere turn aside amidst a court that makes a talk over the smallest\r\naction? And thus if you cannot flee, then in my opinion there is nothing\r\nmore difficult than to shun that which is essentially pleasing to you.\r\nBelieve me, all that may be said to you against this is hypocrisy and\r\nfounded on a want of knowledge of the human heart. A man is not master\r\nover his own heart; he cannot at his will squeeze it in his fist and then\r\nset it free again.”\r\n\r\nBoth contemporaries and posterity have not without foundation harshly\r\njudged favouritism under Catherine. One-sidedness and harshness of\r\njudgment in this respect have however deprived both contemporaries and\r\nimmediate posterity of the possibility of dispassionately estimating\r\nthe personality of the empress in general. Taking into consideration\r\nCatherine’s unusual capacities, the circumstances in which she was\r\nplaced, and her temperament, it is impossible not to acknowledge that\r\nin accusing her we must not lose sight of the age in general and of the\r\nmorals at the court in particular. Favouritism was no new apparition\r\nunder Catherine. Almost the same state of things had arisen during the\r\nreign of Elizabeth Petrovna. A particularly unpleasant impression,\r\nhowever, is made by frequent changes of favourites. One after another\r\nin turn there were “in favour”: Gregory Orlov, Vasiltchikov, Potemkin,\r\nZavadovski, Zoritch, Korsakov, Lanskoi, Ermolov, Mamonov and Zubov. Both\r\nRussians and foreigners have harshly censured Catherine for the rapidity\r\nof these changes, which were unexpected and sometimes without any visible\r\ncause. On the other hand, even writers who are unfavourable to Catherine\r\nhave praised her for the fact that not one of the favourites banished\r\nfrom the court was ever persecuted or punished, while history presents a\r\nmultitude of examples of cruelty and extreme arbitrariness on the part of\r\ncrowned women in parallel cases.\r\n\r\nIt must be acknowledged, however, that favouritism, given the unbounded\r\ncupidity of Catherine’s favourites and of their relations, friends, and\r\nacquaintances, cost the treasury and the nation very dear.[h]\r\n\r\nUnder the influence of new favourites and other confidants, the second\r\nhalf of Catherine’s reign assumed an essentially different character as\r\nregards her actuating motives, although in the outward course of events a\r\ncertain resemblance to the first half was preserved. When Catherine began\r\nto reign she had in mind a policy of peaceful splendour, advised also\r\nby Panin; she would willingly have secured the sovereignty of Poland by\r\npacific means. It was only the force of circumstances which drew her into\r\nan undesired war.\r\n\r\nNow her ambition assumed a different direction; we behold her recklessly\r\nbent on high-handed conquests, taking the initiative and deliberately\r\nmaking plans to bring about new wars. And, as this has often proved the\r\ncase when government is vested in a woman, the change was caused by the\r\nmost intimate personal circumstances. It would be out of place here to\r\nrelate in detail the paltriness of all the court intrigues. It will\r\nsuffice to recall the fact that Catherine, weary of the brutal tyranny\r\nof Gregory Orlov, tried to shake off his yoke and only succeeded with\r\ndifficulty in wrenching herself free. She sent him at the time of the\r\nplague to Moscow, much against his will, and his numerous enemies hardly\r\nconcealed their hope that he might never return. The empress endeavoured\r\nto keep him at a distance when he returned, but he struggled to remain\r\nmaster of the field and to stand his ground, although he saw himself\r\nsupplanted in her personal favour by an insignificant young officer of\r\nthe guards called Vasiltchikov.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Rise of Potemkin_\r\n\r\nWhen Catherine began after a time to feel ashamed of the insignificance\r\nof this young man, the much discussed General Gregory Alexandrovitch\r\nPotemkin, known to the empress in the days of her quarrels with her\r\nhusband, knew how to take advantage of this favourable moment to force\r\nhimself almost by violence into the long coveted position of her\r\nacknowledged and honoured favourite. The Orlovs tried for some time to\r\nwrest from him his sway over Catherine and over Russia, but they were\r\nobliged finally to give way, and retired to the ancient capital of the\r\nempire--which had remained the national capital, the capital of ancient\r\nMuscovy and the refuge of all who had reasons for avoiding the court.\r\n\r\nThere is much in this strife that is characteristic of time and place.\r\nWhen Gregory Orlov was forced to start on his dangerous journey to\r\nMoscow, many hoped, as already pointed out, that he would never return.\r\nWhen he reappeared safe and sound and in excellent health, and it was\r\nfeared that he might regain his lost position in the favour of the\r\nempress, many a shrewd man was unable to conceal his vexation. The\r\ndistinguished German doctor, Tode, to whom may be ascribed practically\r\nall the expedient measures taken in Moscow against the plague,\r\nremained not only unrewarded, but was unable for a long time to obtain\r\ncompensation for the loss of his wardrobe. When he finally expressed\r\nhis astonishment thereat, one of the senators is said to have solved\r\nthe riddle with the dry remark: “Well, why did you bring the count back\r\nalive?” Then when Gregory Orlov got married in Moscow it was quite\r\nseriously proposed in the senate that the marriage should be dissolved as\r\nsinful, and that the fallen favourite and his wife should be shut up in\r\npenitential monasteries because they had married within the prohibited\r\ndegrees. The empress, who had bestowed upon her former friend the title\r\nof prince as a consolation and a farewell, was angered by this decree and\r\ncaused it to be revoked. However, in spite of the protection afforded\r\nhim, Gregory Orlov came to a tragic end a few years later (1783). He\r\ndied insane--as tradition will have it, a violent death, one of the\r\nmysterious occurrences that will never be cleared up.\r\n\r\nBut the empress Catherine, generally so acute, was singularly deceived\r\nconcerning Potemkin, the Prince of Darkness, as he was afterwards called\r\nfrom a play on his name. He was the son of an insignificant nobleman\r\nof Smolensk, a retired major, and bore a name till then unknown in\r\nRussian history; a man of doubtful capabilities, ignorant, and in fact\r\ndistinguished by nothing but a boundless and unscrupulous egotism, by an\r\nimmense craving for coarse, extravagant pleasures, and by the nefarious\r\nenergy with which he pursued his selfish desires. The first condition for\r\nhis enjoyment of life was the power to exercise a boundless autocracy and\r\nto be able to tread under foot not only those who bowed before him but\r\nalso those who attempted to resist him.\r\n\r\nThe empress, however, as a woman and conscious of her unauthorised\r\nposition, feeling the need of energetic support, saw in the man, whose\r\nalmost gigantic frame seemed to betoken a titanic nature, something\r\nreally extraordinary, and believed him destined to accomplish great\r\ndeeds. Thus Potemkin retained his ascendancy even after he had withdrawn\r\nfrom her most intimate favours under the pretence of long-continued\r\nill-health, and had thrust forward all sorts of handsome insignificant\r\nyoung men who were one after the other loaded with riches. Potemkin\r\nunderstood how to increase the distrust which the empress felt for her\r\nson, and to keep it constantly awake. He made her believe that she was\r\ncontinually surrounded by dangers; that he was the only one who would\r\nprotect her, and more especially that he was the only one who would wish\r\nto do so under all circumstances. On the other hand he flattered her\r\nvanity still more than her ambition by plans on an adventurously large\r\nscale, by fantastic pictures of fame and greatness which he suggested to\r\nher imagination. Thus, he pointed to the conquest of Constantinople, the\r\nexpulsion of the Turks from Europe, the foundation of a Greek empire on\r\nthe Bosporus, not as triumphs which one might hope to see realised in the\r\nfuture but as deeds which might and should be accomplished within the\r\nnext few years.\r\n\r\nThe general idea was not originated by Potemkin. Field-Marshal Munich had\r\nalready pointed out to the empress that Constantinople was the necessary\r\ngoal of Russian aspirations. But formerly an object so remote in time and\r\nplace aroused but little interest. Now everything seemed to have advanced\r\nwithin grasp; the empress was to wear the crown of the new Greek empire\r\nduring her lifetime; now the idea aroused in her the wildest enthusiasm.\r\nThe very fact that no cautious statesman would consider these plans only\r\nmade Potemkin appear all the greater in her eyes; his assurance raised\r\nhim far above the everyday mediocrity of the others.\r\n\r\nThe eldest grandson of the empress received the name of Alexander, the\r\nsecond the no less significant name of Constantine. The former was in due\r\ntime to inherit the Greek crown from his grandmother. They took care in a\r\nmanner which bordered on exaggeration to make prophesies, or to announce\r\nto the whole world the vast schemes with which they deluded themselves.\r\nThe young prince was not christened according to the Russo-Greek but the\r\nsomewhat different oriental-Greek ritual, as it was practised in the\r\nchurches of his future empire. They tried to procure a Greek nurse for\r\nhim, but as that did not succeed they at least chose one called Helen.\r\nGreek playfellows were found for him, and he learned modern Greek as if\r\nit were his mother tongue.\r\n\r\nThe fascination which Potemkin exercised over Catherine may be\r\nattributed to her feeling of insecurity, to the support Potemkin\r\npromised her, and to the vast prospects he opened out for her ambition.\r\nThere is one thing calculated to astonish us and that is that neither\r\nthe empress nor Potemkin was able to realise how insufficient was the\r\nactual might of Russia at that time to carry out these gigantic schemes.\r\nIt was scarcely surprising that Potemkin should be unable to judge of\r\nthis, for he was an ignorant man, who was wanting in the most elementary\r\npolitical foresight and was besides no thinker. But how came it that\r\nCatherine should be so deceived, who had studied earnestly and had by\r\nthat time accumulated a varied experience? How could it escape her\r\nthat the comparatively limited financial resources of the empire, more\r\nespecially, would prove quite inadequate, particularly as they were\r\nanything but well husbanded? They gave themselves up light-heartedly to\r\nthe magic of the banknote press and thus brought down untold calamities\r\nupon Russia, as has been the case also in other countries. But this\r\ncalamity did not stand alone; it is in fact not to be regarded as an\r\nindependent manifestation, but rather as one of a whole series of\r\nnecessary consequences of a premature effort of Russia to lay claim to a\r\nworld-power of such magnitude and importance, before her might was fully\r\nestablished at home or had attained sufficient maturity.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GENERAL SUVAROV\r\n\r\n(1729-1800)]\r\n\r\nThe fact that the forces of the empire must from that time be almost\r\nentirely devoted to the support of a foreign policy; that little, if\r\nanything, could be done for the development of culture and industry (and\r\nthat only as a matter of secondary importance), that no consideration\r\ncould be given to the most necessary reforms--none of these circumstances\r\nworked Russia such visible and tangible harm as the flooding of\r\nthe country with unconsolidated paper money doomed in advance to\r\ndepreciation; as matters stood, this was probably a greater evil. When\r\nRussia entered upon the grasping policy of Potemkin she began to lay\r\nout her future in advance, so to speak, and that on a scale utterly out\r\nof proportion to the actual gain which might be or which was in fact\r\nattained. The evils which resulted have continued to work themselves\r\nout down to the present day. As in this way the germs of a future power\r\nwere constantly being sacrificed in order to conjure up power in the\r\npresent by overdrawing the resources in hand, the real advancement\r\nof the empire was paralysed, and even the actual might in which they\r\ngloried remained partly a sham which certainly did not correspond with\r\nthe reality. When later it became necessary for Russia to participate in\r\nthe momentous struggles which involved the destiny of Europe, her power\r\nwas not matured, concentrated, or husbanded at the decisive moment--as\r\nfor instance the power of Prussia by Frederick William I; her future\r\nprospects were encumbered by a heavy burden and by manifold obligations,\r\nthe inner development was behind the times, and her financial position\r\nwas shaken. It became necessary continually to make fresh, feverish\r\nefforts, which always over-reached the possibilities of the present and\r\nwhich hindered the inner development afresh, involved the future deeper\r\nand deeper, and exhausted its resources.[i]\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Official Status of the Favourite_\r\n\r\nIt may be deemed necessary in this place to explain what were the duties\r\nexpected from and the distinguished honours paid to the favourites of\r\nCatherine. When her majesty had made choice of a new favourite, she\r\ncreated him her general aide-de-camp, in order that he might accompany\r\nher wherever she went, without incurring public censure. From that period\r\nthe favourite occupied in the palace an apartment under that of his royal\r\nmistress, with which it communicated by a private staircase. The first\r\nday of his installation he received a present of 100,000 rubles, and\r\nevery month he found 12,000 placed on his dressing-table. The marshal\r\nof the court was ordered to provide him a table of twenty-four covers,\r\nand to defray all his household expenses. The favourite was required to\r\nattend the empress wherever she went, and was not permitted to leave\r\nthe palace without asking her consent. He was forbidden to converse\r\nfamiliarly with other women; and if he went to dine with any of his\r\nfriends, the absence of the mistress of the house was always required.\r\n\r\nWhenever the empress cast her eyes on one of her subjects, with the\r\ndesign of raising him to the post of favourite, he was invited to dinner\r\nby some one of her female confidants, on whom she called as if it were by\r\nchance. There she would draw the new candidate into discourse, and judge\r\nhow far he was worthy of her destined favour. When the opinion she had\r\nformed was favourable, a significant look apprised the confidant, who, in\r\nher turn, made it known to the object of her royal mistress’ pleasure.\r\nThe next day he was examined as to the state of his health by the court\r\nphysician, and as to some other particulars by Mademoiselle Protasov, one\r\nof the empress’ ladies, after which he accompanied her majesty to the\r\nHermitage, and took possession of the apartment that had been prepared\r\nfor his reception. These formalities began upon the choice of Potemkin,\r\nand were thenceforth constantly observed.\r\n\r\nWhen a favourite had lost the art of pleasing, there was also a\r\nparticular manner of dismissing him. He received orders to travel, and\r\nfrom that moment all access to her majesty was denied him; but he was\r\nsure of finding at the place of his retirement such splendid rewards\r\nas were worthy of the munificent pride of Catherine. It was a very\r\nremarkable feature in her character that none of her favourites incurred\r\nher hatred or vengeance, though several of them offended her, and their\r\nquitting office did not always depend on herself.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Potemkin’s Schemes of Conquest_\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [1775-1780 A.D.]]\r\n\r\nPotemkin’s rule commenced at the very time in which the Peace of\r\nKutchuk-Kainardji was concluded (July, 1774). The disputes with Poland\r\nand the rebellion of Pugatchev were no sooner ended than he immediately\r\nviolated every condition of that treaty, well knowing that the empress\r\nwould approve of everything he might do. Dowlet Gerai, who was elected\r\nkhan by the now independent Tatars, still remained much more favourably\r\ndisposed to the Turks than to the Russians: the latter, therefore, by\r\nmeans of money and intrigues, raised up a pretender against him; and\r\nthen, under pretence of an armed mediation, a Russian army occupied a\r\npart of the Crimea, and seemed disposed to make the khan a prisoner, and\r\nto seize the whole province. Dowlet Gerai took refuge with the Turks in\r\nApril, 1775, and Sahim Gerai, who was a mere creature of Russia, was\r\nelected in his stead, to the great satisfaction of the Russians, who\r\nforesaw that the majority of the Tatars would oppose the new khan, and\r\nthus furnish them with another pretext for a renewal of hostilities.\r\nA war with the Porte appeared unavoidable, and Romanzov received\r\ncommands to collect a considerable army on the Dnieper, whilst Repnin\r\nin Constantinople was endeavouring to deceive the sultan, and Potemkin\r\nbetrayed the unfortunate Sahim Gerai.\r\n\r\nBy this time Potemkin had ceased to be the personal favourite of the\r\nempress; but he himself recommended his successors in that post to\r\nher notice. Potemkin was indispensable to Catherine in consequence of\r\nthose colossal undertakings which procured her the name of Great; and\r\nbecause the fear with which he inspired all her enemies secured to her\r\nthe possession of the throne, which she withheld from her son Paul.\r\nZavadovski had become the occupant of the apartments of the royal palace\r\nin November, 1776, and been created a major-general; as soon, however, as\r\nhe fell under Potemkin’s suspicion, the latter authoritatively insisted\r\nupon his dismissal. Zavadovski had turned against his patron, and was\r\nan eager favourer of the Orlovs and Field-Marshal Romanzov. For this\r\nreason Potemkin succeeded in obtaining leave of absence for the favourite\r\nin July, 1777, in order to provide during his temporary retirement\r\na substitute who should eventually displace him. Potemkin had long\r\nbefore selected a Major Zoritch for his adjutant, who was politically\r\ninsignificant, but very attractive in his hussar uniform, with a view\r\nto present him to the empress. Zavadovski had no sooner left the palace\r\nthan he carried his design into effect, and the empress made Zoritch a\r\ncolonel adjutant-general and her companion. At the expiration of nine\r\nmonths, he too fell under Potemkin’s displeasure, and was obliged to\r\nretire, for the empress was completely under the control of her minister.\r\nNext came Korsakov, a handsome sergeant in the guards, who was suddenly\r\nraised to the rank of aide-de-camp general. He too was indignant at\r\nPotemkin’s unbounded pride and avarice, but attempted in vain to open\r\nthe eyes of the empress; he was obliged to yield to the influence of the\r\nindispensable tyrant after he had enjoyed the favour of the empress for\r\nfifteen months.\r\n\r\nThe circumstances of the year 1778 were peculiarly favourable to the\r\naccomplishment of Potemkin’s plans of conquest, for war had broken out\r\nin the spring between France and England, and both powers were so fully\r\noccupied in the west that they had no leisure to attend to the concerns\r\nof the east. Potemkin, therefore, sent an army, commanded by Suvarov,\r\nagainst the Kuban and Bedjiak Tatars, whilst other Russians penetrated\r\ninto the Crimea and were guilty of the most cruel devastations. This led\r\nto the seizure of some Russian ships in the straits of the Dardanelles\r\non the part of the sultan, who was, however, unable to commence a war\r\nwithout the aid and co-operation of France. But that power, unwilling\r\nto break with Russia, insisted on mediating, and the sultan was forced\r\nto acquiesce. The result was that the Russian ships were restored, and\r\nthe sultan formally recognised Sahim Gerai as the rightful ruler of the\r\nCrimea.\r\n\r\nCatherine was so pleased with the conduct of France on this occasion that\r\nshe embraced with alacrity the plan of the armed neutrality, which was\r\ndevised by the French minister Vergennes; and in 1780 she put herself\r\nat the head of that league which was joined by almost all the powers of\r\nEurope except Great Britain. It was formed for the purpose of resisting\r\nthe right asserted by the English navy to make prize of an enemy’s\r\ngoods, or of goods shipped for an enemy’s port, wherever found, and even\r\nthough covered by a neutral flag. The leading principle of the league was\r\nthat free ships make free goods. Great Britain would not admit this; but\r\nat that time she did no more than expostulate with her good friend and\r\nally the empress of Russia. It was not until the reign of Paul that she\r\nwaged war for the maintenance of the opposite principle, which she later\r\nrepudiated during the Crimean War.\r\n\r\nFrom this time forward, as we have seen, Potemkin, Voltaire, and a host\r\nof flatterers amused the empress with dreams of the restoration of a\r\nByzantine empire, and the erection of a new capital on the Black Sea.\r\nSahim Gerai prized the slavish title of a lieutenant-colonel in the\r\nguards of a foreign empress more than that of prince of a nation to which\r\nthe Russian czars for many years had been vassals, and he renounced the\r\nnational costume of his people in order to glitter in a Russian uniform\r\nand wear the decorations of the order of St. Anne. Potemkin contrived\r\nevery month to alienate him more and more from his people, till at last\r\nthis miserable man was induced to lay down his khanate, from which he\r\nderived a revenue of three or four millions of rubles, in order, as he\r\nthought, to revel peacefully in the enjoyment of some hundred thousand\r\nrubles, which Potemkin was to pay him as the newly appointed Russian\r\ngovernor-general of Tauris, as the country was now to be called. Potemkin\r\nwas too much accustomed to receive and not to give, and to contract debts\r\nwithout thinking of paying them, to give himself much concern about the\r\npayment of the promised salary, although the empress was led to believe\r\nthat the yearly sum always charged to her was in reality regularly paid\r\nto the khan.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [1783 A.D.]]\r\n\r\nThe shamelessness of the Russian government on this occasion fully\r\nequalled the audacity of their manifestoes respecting the partition of\r\nPoland, or that of the state-papers of a Genz and a Talleyrand. In the\r\nRussian manifestoes published in April, 1783, it was made as clear as the\r\nsun to the Tatars that the empress and Potemkin were really proposing to\r\nconfer upon them the most signal benefits. It was stated that the Tatars,\r\nas Russian subjects, were in future to be delivered from all the evils\r\nof their internal disputes, and by the incorporation of the Crimea, the\r\nKuban, and the eastern Nogaians an end was to be put to those oppressions\r\nfrom which they had hitherto suffered from the Turks and the Russians\r\nalternately. What the correspondence was between these promises and the\r\nsubsequent reality may be learned from all the works of travellers who\r\nvisited these districts, and gave accounts of the Crimea and the Tatars\r\na generation or two later. That numerous, free, and rich race of people,\r\nclothed in silks and of noble appearance, had then dwindled into a crowd\r\nof starving beggars; their magnificent tented cities had become gipsy\r\nencampments, and their houses and palaces exhibited mere masses of ruin\r\nand decay.\r\n\r\nThese manifestoes, indeed, as is usually the case, were not intended\r\nfor those to whom they were addressed, but merely to conceal in a\r\ncloud of words, from the eyes of those at a distance, the cruelties\r\nand bloodshed with which they were accompanied. The Tatars made an\r\neffort to defend their liberties, and their magnates made no secret\r\nof their dissatisfaction; Potemkin, therefore, had recourse to one of\r\nthose heroic means which usually find defenders enough when they are\r\napplied for the support of the true faith and of autocratic government,\r\nand are only reviled and execrated in the hands of a Danton and a\r\nRobespierre. He proposed by a single massacre summarily to annihilate\r\nthe malcontents, and to awe the rest into submission by the dread of a\r\nsimilar fate. Posorovski received express orders to make himself master\r\nof the malcontents, their families, and adherents, and put them all to\r\nthe sword; he, however, possessed moral courage enough to decline the\r\nbusiness of an executioner. Potemkin’s cousin was not so scrupulous.\r\nAccording to the accounts, whose unanimous testimony we are obliged to\r\nfollow, even when it appears to us incredible, Paul Potemkin caused\r\nabove thirty thousand Tatars, of every age and sex, to be massacred in\r\ncold blood, and in this way procured for his cousin the easily won title\r\nof the Taurian, and the place of grand-admiral of the Black Sea and\r\ngovernor-general of the new province of Tauris.\r\n\r\nThe massacre in Tauris took place in April, 1783, and the Turks were\r\nunable to render any assistance to the Tatars without foreign support.\r\nAmong the European powers, however, England was at that time fully\r\noccupied with the disturbances which in the following year brought Pitt\r\nto the helm of affairs; France was glad to see an end to the American\r\nwar; Joseph II was bound by the Treaty of Tsarskoi Selo; Frederick II\r\nhoped to become master of Thorn and Dantzic, if Russia was well-disposed\r\ntowards him; and Gustavus III of Sweden was the only monarch who could\r\nhave rendered any aid. In the very same year, however, Gustavus suffered\r\nhimself to be induced to go to Friedrichsham, where he sold himself to\r\nthe empress; nothing, therefore, was now left to the Turks but to yield\r\nto their destiny. The sultan did what had been done by the king of Poland\r\na few years before; by his consent he changed that into a righteous\r\nand legal possession which, being seized in the midst of peace, was\r\npreviously a robbery. The whole territory of the Tatars, the Crimea, the\r\nisland of Taman, and a great part of the Kuban were ceded to Russia,\r\nand a treaty of commerce was forced upon the Turks, by virtue of which\r\nthe Russian consuls in the various ports of Turkey were erected into a\r\npower wholly independent of the government of the country. This treaty of\r\ncommerce had been drawn up by Panin before he had been obliged to yield\r\nto the superior influence of Potemkin and withdraw from public affairs;\r\nand it was now concluded on the 10th of June, 1783. By virtue of this\r\ntreaty the Turks were obliged to submit the decision of all mixed civil\r\ncases in which a Russian and a Turk were the respective parties, not to\r\nthe local tribunals, nor to the higher authorities, nor to a court of\r\narbitration, but to the Russian consul; and in all pecuniary transactions\r\nthe claims of a Russian against a Turk were urged with much greater\r\nstrictness than in those cases in which the Turk was the claimant and the\r\nRussian the debtor.\r\n\r\nIn the eyes of the world, which regards only externals, Potemkin was now\r\na great and admired statesman; and so absolute was his sway over the\r\nempress herself, that she not only tolerated his insolence, his total\r\nneglect of all pecuniary obligations, his tyranny over all classes,\r\nand his imperial expenditure and magnificence, but allowed him to help\r\nhimself to an unlimited extent out of the coffers of the state. Potemkin\r\non the one hand did homage to the empress as if she were a goddess, and\r\non the other he suffered himself to treat her with the most insolent\r\nfamiliarity and rudeness. He would even saunter from his own apartments\r\ninto hers in his dressing-gown and slippers, with his stockings hanging\r\ndown and his legs bare. He went so far as to extort from those who\r\nenjoyed the empress’ favour a part of the money which they received from\r\nher, and yet he allowed poor Sahim Gerai to starve. He never paid him\r\nthe assigned pension of 100,000 rubles which was yearly debited to the\r\nempress’ account, and even the displeasure of Catherine could not induce\r\nhim to bestow upon this Russian _protégé_ the simplest means of life.\r\n\r\nThe founding of a new Russo-Grecian capital, with which Potemkin now\r\nbusied himself, was a magnificent piece of flattery for the empress, but\r\nfor which she was unhappily obliged to pay too dear. Catherine indulged\r\nwith Voltaire in those visionary schemes of a utopian Greece, of a\r\ncivilisation of which she and not the people was to be the source, of an\r\nenlightenment, industry, and trade to be carried into these conquered\r\ndeserts by ukases and courtiers; Potemkin acted according to this fancy.\r\nHe first erected a city with buildings of every description, and then\r\nsought for inhabitants, or forcibly drove them for a time from all\r\nquarters, when he wished to make a court-spectacle of this theatrical\r\ncity and to enchant the empress. It was of no consequence to him that\r\nhis city fell to pieces and its inhabitants disappeared as soon as he\r\nturned away his eyes. The new city was called Kherson, a name long since\r\nobscured by that of Odessa; the empress granted 18,000,000 rubles,\r\nmost of which, however, Potemkin diverted to his own private use. The\r\nsituation was badly chosen, and yet this shadow of a capital was for a\r\nlength of time charmed into existence by innumerable arts of fraud and\r\nopen violence; and the deserts of which it was to be the metropolis were\r\nerected into a province, to which Potemkin gave the name of Catherine’s\r\nGlory (_Slava Ekatharina_). Another province, somewhat farther to the\r\nnorth, near the celebrated falls of the Kaidak, was also honoured with\r\nthe name of the empress, and called Iekatarinoslav.\r\n\r\n\r\nGENERAL SUVAROV\r\n\r\nThe general to whom Potemkin at this time assigned the congenial task\r\nof havoc and destruction in the country of the Nogaian Tatars and in\r\nKuban was Suvarov, a man who from that period till the end of the\r\ncentury had the misfortune to be continually employed as the instrument\r\nof a murderous military despotism. In Poland he executed three times\r\nthose orders of annihilation which were issued from St. Petersburg. He\r\ndestroyed the Turks and sacrificed the Russians by thousands at the will\r\nof Potemkin. He subsequently shared Paul’s hatred against the French and\r\nevery thought of civil freedom, and performed the same kind of heroic\r\ndeeds for that madman’s pleasure as he had previously done at the bidding\r\nof Potemkin. He was undoubtedly one of the greatest generals of modern\r\ntimes, but wholly destitute of humanity, for he sacrificed thousands\r\nwithout hesitation in order to secure a victory or storm a fortress, when\r\neither was calculated to produce a splendid effect though but for the\r\nmoment. He not only flattered the empress, but even the common soldiers\r\nand their superstitions. Though he was a man of various knowledge,\r\nand had made himself master of all the arts of life as practised in\r\nthe highest society, he assumed at court the character of a sort of\r\ncourt-fool, and acted often as if he were mad, merely in order to carry\r\nout some surprising piece of flattery. In the company of the common\r\nsoldiers he affected the manners of the semi-barbarous Russian, lived as\r\nthey did themselves, submitted to every privation which they might be\r\ncalled upon to endure, and knelt and prayed before every wayside image,\r\noften when the roads were deep with mud.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FAVOURITES LANSKOI AND IERMOLOV\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [1785 A.D.]]\r\n\r\nAt the time when a high-flown sentimentality was the fashion in Germany,\r\nand the empress was past fifty, she indulged in a fit of romantic love\r\nfor the insipid and spiritless Lanskoi. This turn in her affections\r\nwas very agreeable to Potemkin, for Lanskoi neither took up the cause\r\nof the destitute khan, nor yielded to the allurements of the king of\r\nPrussia, the emperor Joseph II, or the English, when they were desirous\r\nof engaging him in affairs of state. Potemkin freely permitted the\r\nempress to indulge her visionary love for the wonderfully handsome and\r\nyouthful face which captivated her affections, and did not grudge her,\r\namong the many gross and degrading scenes of her life, the enjoyment\r\nof one romantic passion, after the manner of Werther and Siegwart,\r\nfrom the year 1780 till July, 1784. Catherine’s love for Lanskoi had\r\nbeen romantic in his life, and her sorrow at his death was not less\r\nextravagant; but notwithstanding all this ideality, she had been also\r\ncareful to show him substantial proofs of her affection at the cost of\r\nthe country. She bestowed upon him not only all possible titles, orders,\r\nand decorations--diamonds, plate, and collections of every kind, but he\r\nleft behind him in cash a property of 7,000,000 rubles.\r\n\r\nThe fantastic mourning for Lanskoi was no sooner evaporated than the\r\nempress allowed Potemkin, who presented candidates for every office, to\r\nsupply her with a substitute for her departed lover. In order to exclude\r\nall other pretenders, Potemkin on every such occasion was prepared to\r\nfill the vacancy; and with this view he had for some time made Lieutenant\r\nIermolov one of his adjutants. In 1785 this man became the declared\r\nfavourite of the empress, and soon ventured to pursue a course which\r\nLanskoi would never have thought of. He directed Catherine’s attention to\r\nthe tyranny of Potemkin, and gave her some hints respecting his behaviour\r\ntowards Sahim Gerai. The empress expressed her displeasure without naming\r\nthe person who had made her acquainted with the unhappy fate of the\r\nkhan; Potemkin, however easily guessed that no man in the empire would\r\ndare to speak ill of him to the empress except Iermolov. He therefore\r\nthreateningly replied, “That must have been said by the White Moor,” as\r\nhe was accustomed to call Iermolov on account of his fair countenance and\r\nflat nose.\r\n\r\nCatherine did not hesitate severely to reproach Potemkin for his harsh\r\nand unjust conduct towards the khan, and she even wavered for some months\r\nbetween her favourite and this son of the Titans, whom she regarded as\r\nher protector and the creator of her glory and her greatness. At the end\r\nof June, 1786, a fresh scene occurred, by which the empress was compelled\r\nto declare either for the one or the other. Iermolov had made a new\r\nattempt to alienate the empress from Potemkin; the latter, therefore,\r\nhaughtily insisted that either Iermolov or he must retire from her\r\nservice; Catherine felt herself constrained to adhere to Potemkin, and\r\nIermolov went upon his travels. During the course of the year he had been\r\nloaded with riches, and on his departure he was furnished with 100,000\r\nrubles and imperial recommendations to the Russian ambassadors at all the\r\nEuropean courts. On the day after his departure Momonov, another adjutant\r\nof Potemkin, occupied his place.\r\n\r\n\r\nJOSEPH II VISITS CATHERINE; A SPECTACULAR TOUR\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [1787 A.D.]]\r\n\r\nAbout this period Potemkin repeatedly travelled from St. Petersburg to\r\nTauris and back with all the expedition of a courier, whilst he was\r\nengaged in the building of Kherson, in order to prepare a splendid\r\ntriumph for the empress. The neglected Sahim Gerai hastened thither\r\nto meet him and make him acquainted with the urgency of his wants;\r\nbut Potemkin, instead of rendering him any assistance, banished him\r\nto Kaluga, where he fell into a state of the deepest poverty. He then\r\nconceived that he might find some relief from his fellow believers, and\r\nfled to Turkey, but the sultan caused him to be arrested as a traitor\r\nand renegade at Khotin, to be conveyed to Rhodes, and there despatched by\r\nthe bow-string (1787). The plan contemplated by Potemkin and the empress\r\nwas to raise the grand duke Constantine, second grandson of the empress,\r\nto the dignity of emperor of Byzantium, at the expense of the Turks,\r\nand at the same time to incorporate the kingdom of Poland with Russia.\r\nThe new city of Kherson was no sooner ready for this grand theatrical\r\nrepresentation than the empress was to travel thither to receive the\r\nhomage of her new subjects, and to deceive the world by an ostentatious\r\ndisplay of magnificence and pomp.\r\n\r\nJoseph II was invited to meet the empress in Kherson, in order to consult\r\nwith her upon a partition of the Turkish Empire; but Constantine himself\r\nwas in the first instance left at home. The luxury and extravagance\r\nexhibited by Potemkin during the empress’ journey and the fêtes\r\nprepared for her reception and entertainment at Kherson were worthy\r\nof the heaven-storming characters of the pair. They remind us of the\r\nextravagance of the Abassides and the descendants of Timur, with this\r\ndifference--that civilisation and the arts were strangers to the people\r\nof the caliphs and of the Great Mogul. Never perhaps was there seen in\r\nmonarchical Europe, where such things are not rare, such a gross abuse of\r\nthe wealth and well-being of the people, and such insult cast on public\r\nopinion by a contemptible comedy, as on the occasion of this imperial\r\nprogress.\r\n\r\nIt began in January, 1787, and was continued night and day. To facilitate\r\nthe journey by night, Potemkin had caused great piles of wood to be\r\nerected at every fifty perches, which were kindled at nightfall, and\r\nimparted to the whole district almost the brightness of day. On the sixth\r\nday the cortège reached Smolensk, and fourteen days afterwards Kiev,\r\nwhere the degraded Polish magnates, who made a trade of their nation,\r\ntheir honour, and their friendship, were assembled to offer their homage\r\nto the empress and join in the revelry of her court. Potemkin himself\r\nhad gone forward in advance in order to arrange the side-scenes of the\r\ntheatre which he erected from St. Petersburg to Kherson. Deserts were\r\npeopled for the occasion; and palaces were raised in the trackless wild.\r\nThe nakedness of the plains was disguised by villages built for the\r\npurpose of a day, and enlivened by fireworks. Chains of mountains were\r\nilluminated. Fine roads were opened by the army. Howling wildernesses\r\nwere transformed into blooming gardens; and immense flocks and herds\r\nwere driven to the sides of the road in order to delight the eyes of\r\nthe empress in her hasty transit. The rocks in the Dnieper were sprung,\r\nthat the empress might descend the stream as conveniently as she had\r\ntravelled thither in the chamber of her sledge. At the beginning of May\r\nthe whole party embarked on the river in fifteen splendid galleys at\r\nKrementshuk, and on the following day Stanislaus of Poland presented\r\nhimself at Kaniev, in order, as it were, by his insipid and pitiful\r\ncharacter to serve as a foil to the monarchial splendour of a woman.\r\nHe accepted an alms of 100,000 rubles for the expenses of his journey,\r\nwas very graciously received by Potemkin, treated with coldness and\r\nindifference by the empress, and as if his royal Polish income was simply\r\na Russian pension he begged for an augmentation. He was not ashamed to\r\nacknowledge to all the courts whose ambassadors accompanied the empress\r\nthat he regarded his kingdom as a Russian province, for he besought the\r\nempress to grant the succession to his nephew and to his nation the free\r\nnavigation of the Dnieper. As is customary in such cases, there was no\r\nlack of promises; but none of his petitions were really granted, for it\r\nwas impossible either to value or respect him, and in his situation he\r\nwas incapable of inspiring fear.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MEETING OF CATHERINE II OF RUSSIA AND JOSEPH II OF AUSTRIA\r\n\r\n(Painted for THE HISTORIANS’ HISTORY OF THE WORLD by Thure de\r\nThulstrup)]\r\n\r\nThe emperor Joseph, who had anticipated the arrival of his ally in\r\nKherson, travelled to meet her as far as Kaidak, and returned with her.\r\nHe soon perceived that she was shamefully deluded by the appearance\r\nof prosperity, civilisation, and population, and that soon as she had\r\npassed through all was again to become empty and deserted. Like the\r\nvillages, flocks, and men by the wayside, the new buildings in which the\r\ndistinguished travellers passed their nights and the houses and shops in\r\nKherson all vanished again when they had served their temporary purpose.\r\nIt will not be regarded as incredible that 7,000,000 rubles were expended\r\non the journey, when it is known that the throne itself, which was\r\nerected for the empress in what was called the admiralty at Kherson, cost\r\n14,000. Catherine made a magnificent entry into the new city, passing\r\nunder a triumphal arch, on which was inscribed in the Greek tongue, “The\r\nway to Byzantium.”\r\n\r\n\r\nOUTBREAK OF THE AUSTRO-RUSSIAN WAR WITH TURKEY\r\n\r\nAfter the meeting at Kherson the two imperial allies prepared to direct\r\ntheir forces against the whole extent of the Turkish frontier, from the\r\nAdriatic to the Black Sea. Care was taken, however, to furnish an excuse\r\nfor the participation of Austria, by inciting the Turks to make the first\r\nattack; for only in such a case was Austria bound to furnish auxiliaries\r\nto the Russians. To this end Bulgakov, Catherine’s ambassador at\r\nConstantinople, was ordered by every means to excite commotions among the\r\nGreeks, Bulgarians, Wallachians, and Slavonians, as well as in Egypt and\r\nin Asia Minor. The Turks, justly incensed at these intrigues, insisted\r\nupon a distinct declaration of their views on the part of the Russians;\r\nand when they received for answer only the usual diplomatic subterfuge\r\nthat the ambassador must wait for instructions from St. Petersburg, they\r\nimmediately declared war, sent Bulgakov to the state prison of the Seven\r\nTowers, and nothing but the threatening interference of the English\r\nminister could have prevented them from inflicting summary vengeance\r\nupon him, to show their righteous displeasure at the conduct of his\r\ngovernment. Catherine and Joseph had now gained their wishes. The Turks\r\nwere the first to declare war, and a pretence was thus afforded to the\r\nRussians to call upon the Austrians for that aid which they were bound by\r\ntreaty to render in case of an attack on the part of the Turks.\r\n\r\nCatherine published a manifesto, in which after a long enumeration of the\r\npretended wrongs ascribed to the Porte, she added that, provoked by a\r\nconduct, in itself so offensive, she had, very unwillingly, been obliged\r\nto have recourse to arms, as the only means left her for the support\r\nof those rights which she had acquired at the price of so much blood,\r\nand to avenge her wounded dignity, suffering from the violence that had\r\nbeen used towards her minister at Constantinople; that entirely innocent\r\nof all the calamities inevitably engendered by war, she relied with\r\nconfidence, not only on the Almighty protection and the assistance of her\r\nallies, but on the prayers of the Christian world, for triumph in a cause\r\nso just as that which she was obliged to defend. This manifesto was soon\r\nfollowed up by a second, which declared that the Porte had arrogantly\r\npresumed to insist on a categorical answer to its absurd demands; and\r\nthat the empress, forced to repel the aggression of the enemy of the\r\nChristian name, armed herself with confidence, under the protection of\r\nthat just God who had so long and so powerfully shielded the Russian\r\nEmpire.\r\n\r\nHad Potemkin been as great a general as he was capable of devising\r\nmagnificent plans and playing the Russian tyrant, great things would have\r\nbeen accomplished in 1787, for all the preparations for the war had been\r\nmade long beforehand. Field-Marshal Romanzov was to share the command of\r\nthe army with Potemkin; that is to say, he was to do all the work, and\r\nthe other was to engross all the merit. Romanzov declined this thankless\r\noffice, and Potemkin stood alone at the head of the army; but he did not\r\nsucceed in deceiving posterity, for no one has ever ascribed to him what\r\nwas effected by the officers under his command--by Repnin, Paul Potemkin,\r\nSuvarov, Kamenskoi, Galitzin, and Kutusov, all of whom became more or\r\nless renowned in later wars. Potemkin found in Suvarov precisely such an\r\ninstrument as he needed: for to that general the will of the empress or\r\nher favourite was in all cases a law paramount to all moral obligations,\r\nor any feelings of humanity. He was sent to Kinburn, the chief object of\r\nthe campaign being apparently the siege of Otchakov, by the main body\r\nunder Potemkin, whilst other divisions were despatched to observe the\r\nmovements of the Tatars in the Kuban.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [1787-1788 A.D.]]\r\n\r\nKinburn was a small fortress occupied by the Russians, and situated\r\nupon a promontory directly opposite to Otchakov, in and around which\r\nthe Turkish army was stationed. The object of Suvarov’s mission was to\r\nfrustrate the efforts of the Turkish fleet to land a division on the\r\npromontory of Kinburn; and he executed the task in a masterly manner. At\r\nfirst he remained perfectly quiet in the fortress, after having erected\r\na battery at the extremity of the promontory, in order to cannonade the\r\nTurkish ships from the land, at the same moment in which they might be\r\nattacked by the Russian fleet. He allowed the Turks to proceed without\r\nmolestation till they had disembarked from six thousand to seven thousand\r\nmen; he then sent a few regiments of Cossacks against them, and at\r\nthe same time charged them at the head of two battalions of infantry\r\nwith fixed bayonets, and exterminated them all. Immediately afterwards\r\nhe employed his battery against the Turkish fleet. The prince of\r\nNassau-Siegen, who had the command of the Russian gunboats of Nikolaiev,\r\nattacked the Turkish ships at the very entrance of what is called the\r\nLiman, and within range of Suvarov’s guns, to whose well-directed fire he\r\nwas indebted for a great share of the advantages which he gained.\r\n\r\nThe whole remaining part of the year 1787, as well as the spring and a\r\ngreat part of the summer of 1788, elapsed without anything important\r\nhaving been undertaken; the whole of the Russian land-forces were,\r\nhowever, directed towards the Bug, in order to push forward with the\r\ngreatest expedition to the Danube. The Turks had already suffered defeats\r\nat sea and in the Caucasus. The Russian fleet in the Black Sea, which was\r\nalmost wholly commanded by foreigners, nearly annihilated the Turkish\r\nnavy; generals Tallitzin and Tekeli massacred the Tatars of the Kuban,\r\nand Tamara reduced Georgia and Lesghistan. In August, Potemkin at length\r\nmarched against Otchakov, but very wisely left the whole conduct of\r\nthe military operations to Suvarov, the victor of Kinburn. The Russian\r\noperations were delayed in expectation of an Austrian army, which, in\r\nconnection with a Russian force under Soltikov, was to make an incursion\r\ninto Moldavia. This delay was protracted till King Gustavus began to\r\nexhibit symptoms of making an attack on the provinces contiguous to\r\nSweden, which were now deprived of means of defence. He had to revenge\r\non Russia a long series of wrongs, crowned by the intolerable conduct of\r\nCatherine’s ambassador Razumovski, whom she had sent to form conspiracies\r\nagainst him, and to persecute and insult him in his own capital.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SWEDISH WAR (1788-1790 A.D.)\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [1788 A.D.]]\r\n\r\nGustavus III would also willingly have induced Denmark to take part in\r\nthe movement against Russia; in this, however, he was unsuccessful,\r\nalthough supported by England and Prussia. Razumovski, the Russian\r\nambassador, was ordered to leave Stockholm on the 23rd of June, and went\r\nto the army in Finland. The king appeared as if he designed immediately\r\nto march against St. Petersburg, which excited no small concern in the\r\nminds of the government, because, in confident reliance on the king’s\r\nmisunderstanding with the Swedish nobles, the whole of their good troops\r\nhad been despatched to the frontiers of Turkey.\r\n\r\nThe king of Sweden was acquainted with the feelings of his nobles,\r\nconsequently with those of the generals and officers of his army; he\r\ntherefore endeavoured to deprive the malcontents of the apparently legal\r\npoint of a refusal to serve, by changing the offensive war which he\r\ncontemplated into a defensive one, and for this purpose had recourse to a\r\nvery childish subterfuge. There had been a long-existing dispute between\r\nthe two countries respecting the bridge over the small river Kimmene,\r\nthe boundary between the two states, whether it should be painted in\r\nSwedish or Russian colours; he provoked the Russians to maintain this\r\ndisputed right by force of arms, and then proclaimed that he had been\r\nattacked by them, and was therefore justified in carrying on a defensive\r\nwar without consulting the estates. We leave it undecided whether he took\r\npossession of the bridge by force, and thereby compelled the Russians to\r\nresist force by force; or whether, as the best accounts allege, he caused\r\nsome Swedes to be clothed in Russian uniforms in order to attack his own\r\nsoldiers, and in this way to justify an offensive war.\r\n\r\nThe distance from the river Kimmene to St. Petersburg is less than\r\n150 miles. There would have been no difficulty in storming the small\r\nfortresses of Viborg and Friedrichsham, which lay upon the route, and an\r\nunexpected attack from the sea might probably have led to the surprise\r\nand capture of Kronstadt and Kronslot, the former of which is less than\r\ntwenty miles from the open waters, and the latter is situated on a\r\nsand-bank in the sea.[54] The favourable moment, however, for an attack\r\nby sea had been already allowed to pass by the king’s brother Charles,\r\nduke of Södermanland, who commanded the Swedish fleet, and by land the\r\nking was precipitate when he ought to have delayed, and hesitated when\r\neverything depended on rapidity.\r\n\r\nOn the 22nd of June Duke Charles, with fifteen ships of the line and\r\nfive frigates, had fallen in with three sail of Russian ships, to the\r\nnorth of the island of Gothland, which he ought to have captured, but was\r\nrestrained by a feeling of reluctance to begin the war (which was then\r\nactually commenced), and immediately a superior Russian fleet appeared.\r\nAdmiral Greig, an Englishman, commanded it; his fleet outnumbered the\r\nSwedish by two ships of the line and two frigates, and therefore the\r\nissue of the engagement between the two fleets which took place on the\r\n17th of July was the less inglorious for the Swedes. They fell in with\r\nthe Russians off the island of Hogland, and fought with great skill and\r\ncourage; they lost, it is true, one of their line-of-battle ships, but\r\ntook one of the Russian fleet in its stead; at length, however, they\r\nwere compelled to seek for safety in the harbour of Sveaborg, where\r\nthey were kept in a state of blockade by the Russians during the whole\r\nof the campaign. The secretary of the king’s embassy in St. Petersburg\r\ndelivered such an extremely absurd ultimatum that no other answer was\r\ngiven than an order from the commandant to take his departure from the\r\ncapital. Gustavus commanded armaments to be prepared and a commissariat\r\nto be provided, but left the whole superintendence to others, who\r\nneglected everything, and instead of preparing means to oppose entered\r\ninto secret correspondence with the Russians. All this immediately\r\nappeared when the king at length resolved to storm the fortress of\r\nFriedrichsham. He found himself destitute of heavy artillery and other\r\nmaterials of war, which he supposed were all in readiness, and whilst the\r\nartillery was being slowly brought up by land, the nobles were devising\r\nthe most shameful treason.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [1789 A.D.]]\r\n\r\nIt was arranged that Friedrichsham should be at once attacked both by sea\r\nand by land; and Siegeroth had actually landed his troops and commenced\r\noperations when he suddenly received counter orders, because the troops\r\nwhich were with the king refused obedience. In these circumstances,\r\nGustavus had no other alternative than to return to Stockholm, in\r\norder there to recover his royal dignity and power which he had lost\r\nat Friedrichsham. He entered Stockholm in September, and thenceforth\r\noccupied himself in preparing a _coup d’état_, which he accomplished on\r\nthe 17th of February in the following year. Meanwhile, his traitorous\r\nnobles had concluded a truce with Russia, which was so far advantageous\r\nto Gustavus that it liberated his fleet from its captivity in the bay of\r\nSveaborg. He was now dictator and autocrat; he had at command the means\r\nof prosecuting the war with Russia: but the favourable moment was past,\r\nand the Russians had already completed all their preparations by land and\r\nsea for the defence of their provinces bordering upon Sweden. Gustavus’\r\nproject of burning the Russian fleet in the harbour of Copenhagen was\r\ndiscovered beforehand, and brought him nothing but disgrace. When he\r\nagain joined the army in Finland, his Swedes gave evidence of their\r\nattachment and courage; but he himself again contrived to injure the\r\nsuccess of the war by his interference in its conduct. In the murderous\r\nfights which ensued from the middle of June till the end of July, both\r\nthe Russians and Swedes lost great numbers of men, without any other gain\r\non either side than military renown. The Swedes in the meantime were\r\nunfortunate at sea, and could not have profited by their success had they\r\nbeen victorious by land.\r\n\r\nAdmiral Ehrenswerd commanded the Swedish flotilla of flat-bottomed\r\nboats, constructed for navigating the rocky shallows of the coast,\r\nwhilst the similar Russian fleet was under the orders of the prince of\r\nNassau-Siegen, who had shortly before been commander of the Russian fleet\r\nin the Black Sea, and had fallen into disputes with Potemkin, which led\r\nto his being sent to the Baltic. The Russian ships of the line were under\r\nthe command of Admiral Tchitchakov, and had on board a considerable\r\nnumber of British naval officers of experience. This fleet had on the\r\n26th of June fallen in with that of the Swedes, which was so injured in\r\nan engagement between Bornholm and Gothland as to be obliged to return to\r\nKarlskrona. The unfortunate issue of the battle was generally ascribed to\r\ndisloyalty on the part of some of the naval officers.\r\n\r\nThe king still persisted in his determination of opening up a way for\r\nhimself to St. Petersburg, and therefore of storming Friedrichsham. He\r\nhimself directed the execution of the project, although he was, properly\r\nspeaking, merely a volunteer with his army. By his interference he\r\nexposed the Swedish army to considerable loss, on the same day (August\r\n24th) on which the Russian flotilla gained an important victory over the\r\nSwedes at Rogensalm. Friedrichsham, according to the king’s command,\r\nwas to be stormed by the three generals, Siegroth, Kaulbart, and Platen;\r\nthe assault, however, failed of success, and the Swedes were obliged\r\nto retire: their flotilla was twice beaten. The first victory of the\r\nRussians at Rogensalm was attributed to the prince of Nassau-Siegen,\r\nwho, however, was accompanied by three or four persons who rendered him\r\nthe same service which the British officers did to Admiral Tchitchakov.\r\nOn the 1st of September the Swedish flotilla experienced a defeat at\r\nHögfors, and the land army, commanded by the king, was there also\r\ncompelled to retreat. The loss in human life was indeed great, but the\r\nreal injury small, for the Swedish army continued till the beginning of\r\nwinter to occupy its quarters on the frontiers of Russia.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Campaign of 1790; the Treaty of Varela_\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [1790 A.D.]]\r\n\r\nDuring the winter, Gustavus withdrew from his army, but he resumed his\r\nduties as commander in March, 1790, and was now careful to supply all the\r\ndeficiencies of the two previous years. On the 15th of April, in Finland,\r\nhe reduced the two important posts of Kärnakoski and Pardakovski near\r\nVilmanstrand; his Swedes were victorious at Valkiala; and on the 30th\r\nrepulsed the Russians in their attempt to recover the two posts just\r\nmentioned. On the 4th and 5th of May the Swedes were afterwards beaten at\r\nAberfors by the Russian general Numsen, and lost twelve pieces of cannon.\r\nThe king having again taken Pardakovski, the key of Savolax, immediately\r\ncaused a portion of his land forces to embark in the flotilla, of which\r\nhe himself assumed the command, and ordered the remainder of the army\r\nto press forward by the shore towards St. Petersburg, relying on the\r\nassistance of the fleet, which was to receive them on board in case of\r\na defeat. The fleet consisted of nineteen large ships, twenty-seven\r\ngalleys, and a number of gunboats, which in all mounted about two\r\nthousand guns. It was absolutely necessary to the execution of this\r\nadventurous undertaking that Friedrichsham should in all haste be\r\nreduced by storm. The king, having been successful on the 15th in a\r\nnaval engagement, made his third attempt at storming the fortress on the\r\n17th and 18th of May, and notwithstanding a great loss in men failed in\r\neffecting his object. Although the way by land thus remained barred, he\r\nnevertheless persisted in his design of terrifying the empress in her\r\ncapital.\r\n\r\nGustavus, having now embarked a greater number of Swedish troops than\r\nbefore, reached Viborg, and on the 2nd of June, 1790, disembarked a\r\ndivision of his army at Blörke, about forty miles from St. Petersburg.\r\nThe whole success of this rash enterprise depended on his remaining\r\nmaster of the sea. In order to maintain this superiority, Duke Charles\r\nwas to prevent the junction of the two Russian fleets, one of which was\r\nlying in Kronstadt and the other in Revel, and on the 3rd of June he\r\nwas ordered to engage the division of the fleet in the former harbour.\r\nThe Swedish fleet was no sooner thus withdrawn from its position than\r\nan opportunity was afforded to the Russians to form a junction between\r\ntheir two fleets, which actually took place on the day the duke entered\r\nthe sound of Viborg (June 6th). The Swedish fleet was blockaded by the\r\nRussian squadrons, consisting, when united, of thirty ships of the line\r\nand eighteen frigates; the former, however, continued to keep up its\r\nconnection with the flotilla. It appears that both the Swedish fleets\r\nwould have been entirely lost had the two Russian admirals been qualified\r\nfor such a command. Captain Pélissier, who had served in Holland, is\r\nsaid to have given Admiral Tchitchakov advice which he ought to have\r\nfollowed, had he not been too obstinately attached to his own opinions;\r\nPélissier even pointed out to generals Suchtelen and Soltikov the places\r\nwhere they ought to have erected their batteries in order effectually to\r\nbar the egress of the Swedish fleet from the bay; no attention, however,\r\nwas paid to his advice. The prince of Nassau-Siegen proved himself to be\r\nin no respect superior as a commander to Tchitchakov. On the other hand,\r\nif the advice of Duke Charles had been adopted, the Russians would have\r\nbeen victorious without a battle; King Gustavus and Stedingk, however,\r\nrescued the honour of the Swedish name.\r\n\r\nThe Swedes had now been closely shut up in the bay of Viborg for three\r\nweeks, and at the end of June were reduced to extremities; in the\r\nbeginning of July a grand council of war was held. Duke Charles and many\r\nother members of the council recommended a capitulation, but the king\r\nand Stedingk were in favour of making a desperate effort to force their\r\nway through the enemy’s line. The attempt was accordingly made on the\r\n3rd of July, and through Tchitchakov’s neglect it was so far successful,\r\nas it enabled the Swedish fleet to bring the blockading squadron to an\r\nengagement. But the Swedes lost in it not only seven ships of the line,\r\nthree frigates, and more than thirty galleys and gunboats, but almost\r\nthe whole of the royal guards, the queen’s regiment, and that of Upland,\r\namounting to six thousand or seven thousand men, which had been put on\r\nboard the fleet. Whilst the larger Swedish ships thus endeavoured to\r\ngain the open sea, the flotilla had withdrawn for safety into an arm\r\nof the gulf, which runs parallel to the shore and stretches towards\r\nFriedrichsham. This inlet, called the sound of Suenske, is extremely\r\ndifficult of access on the side towards Friedrichsham, in consequence\r\nof a group of rocky islands at its mouth, but it may be safely reached\r\nthrough the open harbour of Asph. By this way the prince of Nassau-Siegen\r\ndetermined to pass into the sound with the Russian flotilla, and attack\r\nthe Swedes in their place of refuge.\r\n\r\nThe latter were well protected from the attack of the Russian fleet by\r\nrocks, and when the prince gave orders for the assault, on the 9th, the\r\nsailors were so exhausted and his orders for battle were so unskilful\r\nthat the king of Sweden gained a splendid victory on that and the\r\nfollowing day. The loss of the Russians was so great as to have surpassed\r\nany which they had suffered since the Seven Years’ War. Fifty-five\r\nvessels were captured, a number of others destroyed, and fourteen\r\nthousand Russians either taken prisoners or slain. In spite of this\r\nsignal victory, the king of Sweden now awoke from his dream of humbling\r\nthe pride and glory of Russia; already he began to cast his eyes towards\r\nFrance, and in the following year he dreamed his monarchical dream in\r\nfavour of the French émigrés. The idea of becoming the Godefroy de\r\nBouillon of the aristocratic and monarchical crusade, which Burke at that\r\ntime proclaimed in the English parliament and in his work on the French\r\nRevolution, had been awakened in his mind in 1790, and the empress of\r\nRussia found means of confirming him in his visionary projects. Moreover\r\nhis means were exhausted, and he therefore lent a favourable ear to the\r\nproposal of Galvez, the Spanish ambassador, who began to mediate for a\r\npeace between Sweden and Russia.\r\n\r\nThis peace, concluded at Varela on the Kimmene on the 14th of August,\r\n1790, served to show how empty all Gustavus’ splendour was, and how\r\nunreal and inefficient were all the efforts he had made. It was now seen\r\nthat all the blood had been shed to no purpose, and all the treasures of\r\nhis very poor kingdom mischievously squandered, for everything remained\r\non the footing on which it had been in the spring of 1788.\r\n\r\n\r\nPROGRESS OF THE AUSTRO-RUSSIAN WAR WITH TURKEY\r\n\r\nWe now return to the war in which Austria and Russia were jointly engaged\r\nagainst Turkey. The whole Austrian army was ready to take the field at\r\nthe end of the year 1787: it formed an immense cordon stretching from\r\nthe mountains on the coast of the Adriatic Sea to the Carpathians, and\r\nconsisted of a main body and five divisions. Unhappily, the emperor\r\nJoseph was desirous of commanding the main army in person, under the\r\nunskilful direction of Lacy, his military Mentor, who, like his pupil\r\nMack, was a good drill-sergeant, but no general. The main body consisted\r\nof 25,000 infantry and 22,000 horse, and the whole of the troops together\r\namounted to 86,000 cavalry and 245,000 foot, accompanied by 898 pieces of\r\nartillery.\r\n\r\nIn February, 1788, Russia and Austria had simultaneously declared war\r\nagainst the Turks; but in August of that year England and Prussia\r\nentered into an alliance, the main object of which was to place Prussia\r\nin a situation to prevent the aggrandisement of Austria, if necessary,\r\nby force of arms. This, however, was superfluous in 1788, because the\r\ndiversion effected by the king of Sweden prevented the Russians from\r\nproceeding with their usual rapidity, and the emperor Joseph by his\r\npresence with the army frustrated the effect of his immense armaments.\r\nThe dissatisfaction with the whole conduct of the war became so general\r\nthat Joseph was at length obliged earnestly to entreat Laudon, who had\r\nbeen the popular hero of the Austrians since the time of the Seven Years’\r\nWar, and whom the emperor had hitherto neither employed nor consulted, to\r\nassume the command of the army in Croatia.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Successes of Laudon (1788 A.D.)_\r\n\r\nLaudon, having made an express stipulation that the emperor was not to\r\ninterfere with his plans marched against the Turks, defeated them under\r\nthe walls of Dubitza the very day after he joined the army, and reduced\r\nthat fortress; then, pushing into the heart of Bosnia, he compelled\r\nNovi to surrender, whilst the emperor himself was obliged to hasten to\r\nthe aid of the army in the Bannat, which was very hard pressed by the\r\nTurks. The division under Wartensleben, which should have supported it,\r\nhad been driven back by the Turks, who succeeded, in consequence of\r\nan incomprehensible neglect on the part of the Austrians, in getting\r\ncomplete possession of the rocky bed through which the Danube has forced\r\na passage at a distance of six-and-twenty miles above New Orsova. The\r\npass, which is not more than a pistol-shot in width, is commanded by a\r\nfortified cleft in the rock, called Veterani’s Hole, and this post the\r\nAustrians should and could have maintained when the main body of the\r\nTurks appeared at Old Orsova on the 7th of August; this, however, they\r\nneglected to do. The Austrian general suffered himself to be defeated and\r\nlost thirteen pieces of cannon, and as his communications with the main\r\narmy were cut off, he was obliged to retreat so far that the garrison\r\nof this important post was left to its fate. The Turks sacrificed great\r\nnumbers of men in order to seize this fastness, by the possession of\r\nwhich they immediately became masters of the whole navigation of the\r\nDanube as far down as Belgrade. As soon as the Danube was lost, the\r\nimperial army found itself threatened in the rear.\r\n\r\nNothing but disaster attended the operations of Joseph and Wartensleben.\r\nThe army under the prince of Coburg was somewhat less unfortunate.\r\nKhotin, which the Russians had captured in the last war without firing a\r\nshot, was reduced by it after a most heroic resistance of three months;\r\nand this was the last exploit of a campaign in which thirty thousand\r\nAustrians fell in desultory skirmishes, and forty thousand were swept off\r\nby pestilence--losses but poorly compensated by the capture of Szabatch,\r\nKhotin, Dubitza, and Novi. Circumstances, however, afterwards proved more\r\nfavourable. Jassy was taken; in October, the Russians were in possession\r\nof five districts of Moldavia and of several passes in Wallachia, and\r\nthe main army was again able to extend the limits of its operations.\r\nWartensleben sat down with a part of the army before Mahadia; and the\r\nemperor kept possession of the country from Pantchova to Semlin.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Victories of Suvarov (1788-1789 A.D.)_\r\n\r\nAfter the massacre perpetrated by Suvarov upon the Turks on the\r\npromontory of Kinburn, the Russians had remained for a long time quiet;\r\nbut by their possession of the coasts they effectually prevented the\r\nTurks from landing any troops, and by the capture of the island of\r\nBeresam wholly excluded them from the mouth of the Dnieper. It was not\r\ntill late in the year 1788 that Potemkin summoned Suvarov from Kinburn\r\nto conduct the siege of Otchakov, where, however, he was wounded, and\r\nafter his return to Kinburn the siege made very little progress. The\r\navarice of Potemkin deprived the soldiers of the necessary supplies; and\r\nthe dreadful cold and disease proved far more injurious to them than the\r\nattacks of their enemies.\r\n\r\nAt length the frost became so intense that the men were obliged to\r\nexcavate pits for dwellings, but the same frost also opened up a means of\r\nattacking the fortress and reducing it after the Russian fashion, that\r\nis, without regard to the sacrifice of thousands of men, a few weeks\r\nearlier than they could otherwise have done. The city is completely\r\nprotected on the side towards the Black Sea by a marshy lake called\r\nLiman; and now that the lake was frozen, Potemkin issued orders to storm\r\nthe fortress from the sea side, where it was weakest. The Russians were\r\ncruelly sacrificed: one regiment was no sooner mowed down than another\r\nwas compelled to advance, and above four thousand men were slain before\r\nthe storming of Otchakov was effected (December 16th), an exploit which\r\nwas afterwards extolled to heaven. The Russians, having at length borne\r\ndown all resistance and forced their way into the city, were compensated\r\nfor their losses and sufferings during the siege by three days’ murder\r\nand pillage; they put citizens and soldiers, men, women, and children to\r\nthe sword without mercy or distinction. It is said that twenty thousand\r\nTurks perished in this massacre; but this piece of Russian heroism, which\r\nwas not performed by Potemkin himself but by others at his command, was\r\nalso rewarded after the Russian fashion. Every soldier who had taken\r\npart in the siege received a medal of honour, whilst Potemkin, who had\r\ncontributed nothing to its success, derived the only real advantage. The\r\nempress had previously deprived Razumovski of the office of hetman, which\r\nshe now conferred upon Potemkin, who received in addition a present of\r\n100,000 rubles, besides what he had appropriated to himself out of the\r\nmoneys destined for the besieging army, and what he had seized out of the\r\nrich booty which fell into his hands after the capture of the city.\r\n\r\nThe death of the sultan Abd-el-Habed in April, 1789, made no change in\r\nthe relations between the Turks and Russians. His successor, Selim,\r\ncontinued to prosecute the war, and Suvarov having recovered from the\r\neffects of his wound again joined Potemkin’s army, and was put at the\r\nhead of the division which was to co-operate with the Austrians. Laudon\r\nhad now the command of the whole Austrian army; the prince of Coburg,\r\nhowever, retained that of the division which was to keep open the\r\ncommunications with the Russians; and again he gave such numerous proofs\r\nof his incapacity to conduct any great undertakings, or even to help\r\nhimself out of trifling difficulties, that the history of the campaign of\r\n1789 alone ought to have prevented the emperor Leopold from entrusting\r\nhim with the command against the French, who possessed generals and\r\nsoldiers of a very different kind from those of the Turks. Selim III\r\nhad succeeded in getting on foot a very considerable force which was\r\ndestined to operate on the extreme point of Moldavia, where that country\r\ntouches upon Transylvania, and is separated from Wallachia by a small\r\nriver, which also divides the little town of Fokshani into two parts, one\r\nbelonging to Moldavia, and the other to Wallachia. Coburg was advancing\r\nthither slowly and methodically, when the Turkish army encamped in the\r\nneighbourhood of the town turned suddenly upon him, and filled him with\r\nsuch apprehensions of being completely shut in that, instead of boldly\r\ndoing what Suvarov afterwards did, he anxiously besought that general’s\r\nspeedy assistance.\r\n\r\nSuvarov’s army was lying at Belat in Moldavia; when the news reached him\r\nhe at once began a march of between forty and fifty miles in a direct\r\nline over mountains, across ravines and pathless wilds, and in less than\r\nthirty-six hours reached the Austrians on the 30th of July, at five\r\no’clock in the evening. At eleven that night he sent the plan of the\r\nattack upon the Turks, which was to commence at two in the morning, to\r\nthe astonished prince, who had never heard of such rapidity of movement,\r\nor seen it equalled even on parade. The bewildered prince went three\r\ntimes to Suvarov’s quarters without having seen him; in the battle he\r\nmade no claim to the supreme command, which should have belonged to\r\nhim as the eldest general, but submitted as a subordinate to Suvarov’s\r\norders. The Turks, to the number of between fifty and sixty thousand men,\r\nwere in position at Fokshani when the Russians and Austrians with forty\r\nthousand men passed the river Purna and stormed their fortified camp,\r\nmounting the ramparts and driving them in at the point of the bayonet,\r\nas if they were assaulting ordinary field-works. The camp was taken in\r\nan hour, with the loss of about eight hundred men; the whole body of the\r\nTurkish infantry fell into disorder, their cavalry galloped off, were\r\nscattered in all directions, and pursued for some miles with the greatest\r\nimpetuosity and vehement zeal. The whole of the baggage and artillery,\r\nall the stores collected in Fokshani, a hundred standards and seventy\r\npieces of cannon, fell into the hands of the victors; the Austrians\r\nexhibited the same zeal, perseverance, and courage as the Russians, and\r\nhad they possessed such a commander as Suvarov, they would have reaped\r\nimmense fruits from the victory, but they became sensible, as early as\r\nAugust, that they were in want of a proper leader.\r\n\r\nSuvarov returned to Moldavia; Coburg looked quietly on whilst the Turks\r\nwere collecting a new army, and suffered the grand vizir to advance\r\nwithout obstruction in Wallachia. The Turks directed Hassan Pasha, who\r\nlay in Ismail, to make an expedition against Repnin, whilst the grand\r\nvizir was to march against Prince Coburg, who had taken up a position at\r\nMartinesti, on the river Rimnik. The news of this fresh attack no sooner\r\nreached the Austrian camp than Coburg, instead of attempting to help\r\nhimself, again had recourse to Suvarov, who had already drawn nearer to\r\nCoburg from Belat. The grand vizir’s army, which had been estimated at\r\none hundred thousand men, pushed forward rapidly by Braila (Ibrahil),\r\nand compelled the advanced posts of the prince to retire into their\r\ncamp. Suvarov received the prince’s letter on the 16th of September,\r\nimmediately gave orders to march, and two days afterwards succeeded in\r\nforming a junction with the Austrians, at the very moment in which they\r\nwere to have been attacked by the Turks.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Austrian and Russian Valour; Austria’s Withdrawal (1789-1790 A.D.)_\r\n\r\nThe Austrians then proved anew that they were not to be surpassed when\r\nnot commanded as usual by princes and privileged persons, who become\r\ngenerals whilst they sleep. Coburg, as he had previously done at\r\nFokshani, totally relinquished the command at Martinesti to Suvarov,\r\nwho immediately availed himself of the oversight of the Turks in not\r\nfortifying their camp before they offered battle, and attacked them by\r\nstorm in their unfinished trenches. The issue was as glorious as it had\r\nbeen on the 31st of July at Fokshani; the contest, however, was more\r\nobstinately maintained. On this occasion the Russians formed the left\r\nwing, whilst the centre and right were occupied by the Austrians, whose\r\nadmirably served artillery scattered the Turkish cavalry, which had made\r\nan attempt to surround and cut off the small body of the Russians. The\r\nvictory in this dangerous and hard-fought battle was gained not merely by\r\nthe courage, activity, and bayonets of the Austrian and Russian infantry,\r\nbut especially by the great military skill of the commander. His orders\r\nto avoid the village of Bochsa, and first to drive the Turks out of the\r\nwoods by which they were covered before commencing the main attack, have\r\nbeen greatly admired, and above all his prudence in not sacrificing the\r\ninfantry in a blind storm, which was the more remarkable in a general\r\naccustomed to bring everything to a rapid determination.\r\n\r\nThe victory was splendid, the booty immense, the Turkish army a second\r\ntime utterly dispersed--a necessary consequence of the nature of its\r\ncomposition--and the number of killed and wounded much greater than at\r\nFokshani. Prince Coburg, on account of this victory, in which he was\r\nentitled to little share, was created a field-marshal; Suvarov received\r\nthe dignity of a count of the empire from the emperor Joseph, and the\r\nempress of Russia for once gave an honourable surname to a man who had\r\nreally earned it by his personal services; she raised him to a level with\r\nher Tchesmian Orlov and her Taurian Potemkin, and called him Rimnikski,\r\nfrom the name of the river on the banks of which he had been victorious.\r\n\r\nThe victory of Rimnik and the capture of Belgrade by Laudon on the 9th\r\nof October were the harbingers of greater success. Hassan Pasha, the\r\nTurkish high-admiral and celebrated conqueror of Egypt, whose confidence\r\nin his good fortune had encouraged him to assume the command of an army,\r\nwas totally defeated at Tobak, in Bessarabia, by Prince Potemkin, and\r\nhis discomfiture was followed by the surrender of Bender, Akerman, Kilia\r\nNova, and Isatza, and by the investment of Ismail. At the same time\r\nthe prince of Coburg took Bucharest and Hohenlohe, forcing the passes\r\nwhich lead into Wallachia, made himself master of Rimnik and Krajova.\r\nLaudon also reduced Semendria and Kladova, and blockaded Orsova, which,\r\nbeing situated in an island of the Danube, was inaccessible to regular\r\nattacks. By these conquests the allies became masters of the whole line\r\nof fortresses which covered the Turkish frontier; the three grand armies,\r\noriginally separated by a vast extent of country, were rapidly converging\r\nto the same point, and threatened, by their united force, to overbear all\r\nopposition, and in another campaign to complete the subversion of the\r\nOttoman empire in Europe.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: AUSTRIANS ENTERING BELGRADE\r\n\r\n(From the painting by Karl von Blaas in the Ruhmeshalle of the Arsenal in\r\nVienna)]\r\n\r\nBut in the midst of this successful career, the increasing ferment in\r\nthe hereditary states of Austria, the rebellion in the Netherlands,\r\nand, still more, the interposition of the maritime powers and Prussia,\r\nchecked the hopes of Joseph at the very moment when his projects of\r\naggrandisement seemed hastening to their completion. Justly alarmed at\r\nthe successes of the two imperial courts, the three combined powers\r\nincited Poland to throw off the yoke of Russia, delivered the king\r\nof Sweden from Danish invasion, and laid the foundation of a general\r\nalliance for reducing the overgrown power of Austria and Russia. The king\r\nof Prussia even encouraged the rising discontents in Hungary, fomented\r\nthe troubles which the impolitic innovations of Joseph had excited in the\r\nNetherlands, and, in the beginning of 1790, opened a negotiation with\r\nthe Porte for the conclusion of an offensive alliance, intended not only\r\nto effect the restoration of the dominions conquered during the existing\r\nwar, but even of the Crimea, and the territories dismembered by the two\r\nimperial courts from Poland.\r\n\r\nThe only power to which Joseph might have turned as a counterpoise to\r\nthis combination was France, from whose recent change of system he had\r\nflattered himself with hopes of a cordial support, and from which he had\r\neven received private largesses to a considerable amount. But now France\r\nwas in the throes of her great revolution, and Joseph was left without\r\na resource. Worn down by innumerable calamities and disease, he died\r\nin February, 1790; and his successor, Leopold, was fortunate enough to\r\nconclude a separate peace with the Porte.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Russia Prosecutes the War; the Storm of Ismail (1790 A.D.)_\r\n\r\nRussia continued to prosecute the war against the Turks without the aid\r\nof Austria. Ismail still held out, and Potemkin, who had been besieging\r\nit for seven months, began to grow impatient. Living in his camp like\r\none of those satraps whom he even surpassed in luxury, he was surrounded\r\nby a crowd of courtiers and ladies, who exerted every effort to amuse\r\nhim. One of these ladies, pretending to read the decrees of fate in the\r\narrangement of a pack of cards, predicted that he would take the town\r\nat the end of three weeks. Potemkin answered, with a smile, that he had\r\na method of divination far more infallible. He instantly sent orders\r\nto Suvarov to come from Galatz and take Ismail in three days. Suvarov\r\narrived and took such measures as would seem to indicate that he designed\r\na renewal of the regular siege; he drew together the scattered divisions\r\nof the troops, formed them into a large besieging army of about forty\r\nthousand men, and ordered the small Russian fleet to come into the\r\nneighbourhood of the city; but his real design was to follow the course\r\nhe had successfully pursued before Otchakov, take advantage of the frost,\r\nand reduce the fortress by storm.\r\n\r\nHad not Ismail, according to ancient usage, been built without advanced\r\nworks, even a general like Suvarov would scarcely have ventured on such\r\nan attack, which in the actual condition of the defences was attended\r\nby such murderous consequences. On the 21st of September the city was\r\ntwice summoned, and on both occasions the garrison and inhabitants were\r\nthreatened with the fate of Otchakov. The Turks, however, did not suffer\r\nthemselves to be terrified into submission, and the fearful storm was\r\ncommenced on the 22nd, at four o’clock in the morning. The wall was not\r\nmounted till eight o’clock, after an unexampled slaughter; but still the\r\nhottest part of the struggle took place in the city itself. Every street\r\nwas converted into a fortress, every house became a redoubt, and it was\r\ntwelve o’clock before the Russians, advancing through scenes of carnage\r\nand desperate resistance, reached the market-place, where the Tatars of\r\nthe Crimea were collected. The Tatars fought for two hours with all the\r\nenergy of despair, and after they had been all cut to pieces the struggle\r\nwas still carried on by the Turks in the streets. Suvarov at length\r\nopened a passage for his cavalry through the gates into the devoted city;\r\nthey charged through the streets, and continued to cut down and massacre\r\nthe people till four o’clock in the afternoon. At the conclusion of\r\nthis dreadful butchery the Russians received the reward which had been\r\npromised them when they were led to the storm and to certain death,--the\r\ncity was given up for three days to the mercy of the victorious troops.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [1791 A.D.]]\r\n\r\nSuvarov himself, in his official report of this murderous enterprise,\r\nstates that in the course of four days 33,000 Turks were either slain\r\nor mortally wounded, and 10,000 taken prisoners. He rates the loss of\r\nthe Russians at 2000 killed and 2500 wounded: a number which seems\r\nto us as improbably small as the usual accounts, which assign 15,000\r\nas the Russian loss, seem exaggerated. There were two French émigrés\r\npresent at this storm, one of whom afterwards became celebrated as a\r\nRussian governor-general and French minister, and the other as a Russian\r\ngeneral in the war against his countrymen. The first was the duke de\r\nRichelieu, or as he was then called de Fronsac, and the second the count\r\nde Langeron. Kutusov also served in this affair under Suvarov and led the\r\nsixth line of attack.\r\n\r\n\r\n_European Intervention; the Treaty of Jassy (1792 A.D.)_\r\n\r\nAbout this time the whole diplomacy and aristocracy of Europe were\r\nbusily employed in endeavouring to rescue the Turks, in order to check\r\nthe dangerously rapid progress of the French and Polish revolutionists.\r\nThere speedily grew up such a general desire as the English wished to\r\npromote--of two evils to choose the least--to secure and uphold the\r\nempire of the Turks and to let the nationality of Poland perish. Russia,\r\nhowever, declined the proffered mediation of England in the war with the\r\nTurks, as she had resolved for this time to give up her conquests in\r\nTurkey in order to indemnify herself in Poland: she accepted merely the\r\nintervention of the friendly Danes.\r\n\r\nPotemkin and the empress were not unthankful for Suvarov’s servility,\r\nsince he threw himself and all his services at their feet, and ascribed\r\neverything to them alone. Repnin, whom Potemkin left at the head of the\r\narmy when he went to St. Petersburg in October, 1790, pursued a very\r\ndifferent course, doing more in two months than Potemkin had done in\r\nthree years. He crossed the Danube with his army, pushed forward into\r\nBulgaria, and caused the whole Turkish army to be attacked and beaten\r\nnear Badadagh by Kutusov, after Gudovitch, the brother of him who had\r\nbeen the faithful aide-de-camp of Peter III, had completely put down\r\nthe Tatars in the Kuban in January, 1791. At the head of forty thousand\r\nRussians, Repnin then advanced against one hundred thousand Turks, under\r\nthe command of the same vizir, Yussuf, who had fought with such success\r\nagainst the emperor Joseph in the Bannat.\r\n\r\nPotemkin eager to appropriate the impending victory, started with great\r\nexpeditiousness from St. Petersburg when both armies were ready for\r\nbattle (July, 1791). He took it for granted that Repnin would certainly\r\nawait his arrival at the army; but he did no such thing. He offered\r\nbattle before the arrival of Potemkin, whose custom it was to enjoy the\r\nfruits in the gathering of which he had no share. The victory which\r\nRepnin gained over the great Turkish army in July at Matchin led to a\r\nviolent altercation between him and Potemkin, who came too late to have\r\nany participation in the honours of the day; Repnin, however, still\r\nremained in command of the army. Potemkin afterwards did everything\r\nin his power to prevent the peace for which Repnin was to negotiate,\r\nalthough he clearly saw that the course of events required the Russians\r\nto give up this wholesale conquest of Turkish provinces. Happily, his\r\ndeath left Repnin’s hands free, and a treaty was concluded at Jassy\r\non the 9th of January, 1792, between Russia and the Porte, by which\r\nthe former acquired nothing more than the fortress of Otchakov, the\r\nsurrounding territory from the Dniester to the Bug, and the protectorate\r\nof Georgia.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE DEATH OF POTEMKIN (1792 A.D.); SÉGUR’S CHARACTERISATION\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [1792 A.D.]]\r\n\r\nNot long after Potemkin’s arrival at Jassy, where his headquarters or,\r\nto speak more properly, his capital and his court were established, he\r\nwas seized with a malignant fever, and presumed to treat it with the same\r\nhaughty contempt with which he had long been used to treat his fellow\r\nmen: he laughed at his physicians, and ate salt meat and raw turnips. His\r\ndisease growing worse, he desired to be conveyed to Otchakov, his beloved\r\nconquest, but had not travelled more than a few miles before the air of\r\nhis carriage seemed to stifle him. His cloak was spread by the road-side;\r\nhe was laid on it, and there expired in the arms of his favourite niece\r\nBranicka. Catherine fainted three times when she heard of his death: it\r\nwas necessary to bleed her; she was thought to be dying. She expressed\r\nalmost as much grief as at the death of Lanskoi; but it was not the lover\r\nshe regretted: it was the friend whose genius assimilated with her own,\r\nwhom she considered as the support of her throne and the executor of her\r\nvast projects. Catherine, holding her usurped sceptre, was a woman and\r\ntimid: she was accustomed to behold in Potemkin a protector whose fortune\r\nand glory were intimately connected with her own. The character of this\r\nRussian vizir has been thus sketched by Count Ségur, who, as ambassador\r\nto St. Petersburg, lived long in habits of intimacy with him:\r\n\r\n“Prince Gregory Alexandrovitch Potemkin was one of the most extraordinary\r\nmen of his times; but in order to have played so conspicuous a part, he\r\nmust have been born in Russia and have lived in the reign of Catherine\r\nII. In any other country, in any other time, with any sovereign, he would\r\nhave been misplaced; and it was a singular stroke of chance that created\r\nthis man for the period that tallied with him, and brought together and\r\ncombined all the circumstances with which he could tally.\r\n\r\n“In his person were collected the most opposite defects and advantages\r\nof every kind. He was avaricious and ostentatious, despotic and\r\npopular, inflexible and beneficent, haughty and obliging, politic and\r\nconfiding, licentious and superstitious, bold and timid, ambitious and\r\nindiscreet. Lavish of his bounties to his relations, his mistresses,\r\nand his favourites, yet frequently paying neither his household nor\r\nhis creditors. His consequence always depended on a woman, and he was\r\nalways unfaithful to her. Nothing could equal the activity of his mind\r\nor the indolence of his body. No dangers could appal his courage; no\r\ndifficulties force him to abandon his projects. But the success of an\r\nenterprise always brought with it disgust. He wearied the empire by the\r\nnumber of his posts and the extent of his power. He was himself fatigued\r\nwith the burden of his existence; envious of all that he did not do, and\r\nsick of all that he did. Rest was not grateful to him, nor occupation\r\npleasing. Everything with him was desultory--business, pleasure, temper,\r\ncarriage. In every company he had an embarrassed air, and his presence\r\nwas a restraint on every company. He was morose to all that stood in awe\r\nof him, and caressed all such as accosted him with familiarity.\r\n\r\n“Ever promising, seldom keeping his word, and never forgetting anything,\r\nnone had read less than he--few people were better informed. He had\r\ntalked with the skilful in all professions, in all the sciences, in every\r\nart. None better knew how to draw forth and appropriate to himself the\r\nknowledge of others. In conversation he would have astonished a scholar,\r\nan artist, an artisan, or a divine. His information was not deep, but it\r\nwas very extensive. He never dived into a subject, but he spoke well on\r\nall subjects.\r\n\r\n“The inequality of his temper was productive of an inconceivable oddity\r\nin his desires, his conduct, and his manner of life. One while he formed\r\nthe project of becoming duke of Courland; at another he thought of\r\nbestowing on himself the crown of Poland. He frequently gave intimations\r\nof an intention to make himself a bishop or even a simple monk. He built\r\na superb palace, and wanted to sell it before it was finished. One day he\r\nwould dream of nothing but war; and only officers, Tatars, and Cossacks\r\nwere admitted to him: the next day he was busied only with politics; he\r\nwould partition the Ottoman Empire, and put in agitation all the cabinets\r\nof Europe. At other times, with nothing in his head but the court,\r\ndressed in a magnificent suit, covered with ribbons presented to him\r\nby every potentate, displaying diamonds of extraordinary magnitude and\r\nbrilliance, he was giving superb entertainments without any cause.\r\n\r\n“He was sometimes known for a month, and in the face of all the town, to\r\npass whole evenings at the apartments of a young woman, seeming to have\r\nalike forgotten all business and all decorum. Sometimes also, for several\r\nweeks successively, shut up in his room with his nieces and several men\r\nwhom he honoured with his intimacy, he would lounge on a sofa, without\r\nspeaking, playing at chess, or at cards, with his legs bare, his shirt\r\ncollar unbuttoned, in a morning gown, with a thoughtful front, his\r\neyebrows knit, and presenting to the view of strangers, who came to see\r\nhim, the figure of a rough and squalid Cossack. These singularities often\r\nput the empress out of humour, but rendered him more interesting to her.\r\nIn his youth he had pleased her by the ardour of his passion, his valour,\r\nand his masculine beauty. Being arrived at maturity, he charmed her\r\nstill by flattering her pride, calming her apprehensions, confirming her\r\npower, and caressing her fancies of oriental empire, the expulsion of the\r\nbarbarians, and the restoration of the Grecian republics.\r\n\r\n“Potemkin began everything, completed nothing, disordered the finances,\r\ndisorganised the army, depopulated his country, and enriched it with\r\nother deserts. The fame of the empress was increased by his conquests.\r\nThe admiration they excited was for her; and the hatred they raised, for\r\nher minister. Posterity, more equitable, will perhaps divide between them\r\nboth the glory of the successes and the severity of the reproaches. It\r\nwill not bestow on Potemkin the title of a great man; but it will mention\r\nhim as an extraordinary person; and, to draw his picture with accuracy,\r\nhe might be represented as the real emblem, as the living image of the\r\nRussian Empire. For, in fact, he was colossal like Russia. In his mind,\r\nas in that country, were cultivated districts and desert plains. It also\r\npartook of the Asiatic, the European, the Tatar, and the Cossack; the\r\nrudeness of the eleventh century, and the corruption of the eighteenth;\r\nthe surface of the arts, and the ignorance of the cloisters; an outside\r\nof civilisation, and many traces of barbarism.”[j]\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE QUESTION OF THE IMPERIAL SUCCESSION\r\n\r\nSome time before the death of Potemkin, Catherine had begun proceedings\r\nintended to bar the czarevitch Paul from the imperial succession.[a]\r\nShe was by no means the cruel, heartless mother that many writers\r\nare inclined to represent; but she knew her son thoroughly well, and\r\nforeseeing how destructive of all good his reign would be she could not\r\nthink without fear of how the empire, which under her rule had made\r\nsuch rapid strides in the path of prosperity, glory, and civilisation,\r\nwould after her remain without any guarantee for the stability and\r\ndurability of its existence. With the intention of preserving the country\r\nfrom such a misfortune, Catherine wished to make over the throne to\r\nthe grand duke Alexander Pavlovitch and therefore the setting aside of\r\nthe czarevitch appeared in her eyes a state necessity. Meanwhile it is\r\nsufficiently well known that Catherine had long been accustomed to place\r\nthe interests of the state above everything and to sacrifice to them\r\nall other considerations and feelings; therefore the difficulties with\r\nwhich so daring an administrative step was doubtless accompanied could\r\nnot stop the creator of the changes of the year 1762. “Obstacles are\r\ncreated in this world,” Catherine once wrote, “in order that persons of\r\nmerit may set them aside and thus add to their reputation; that is the\r\nmeaning of obstacles.” Circumstances were also favourable to this new\r\nchange contemplated by Catherine, for at that time no law existed that\r\nexactly established the order of succession to the throne. The statute\r\nof Peter the Great of the year 1722 was still maintained in full power,\r\nand by this statute the reigning Russian sovereigns had the right of\r\nnaming anyone they liked as their successors to the throne according to\r\ntheir own judgment, without being restrained by any ancient right of\r\nprimogeniture; and in cases where the heir already designated showed\r\nhimself incapable, he could be removed from the throne.\r\n\r\nThe diary of Krapovitski can serve as a proof that in the year 1787,\r\nafter Catherine’s return from her travels in the south of Russia, the\r\nquestion as to the necessity of changing the succession to the throne\r\nhad already matured in the mind of the empress; she entered upon the\r\nhistorical study of the matter and read “the right of will of monarchs.”\r\nOn the 20th of August, in connection with this same question, Catherine\r\ndiscussed with her secretary the extent to which the misfortunes of the\r\nczarevitch Paul Petrovitch had been caused by the false opinion that as\r\neldest son the throne must belong to him. Further, on the 25th of August,\r\nKrapovitski writes: “Ukases as to the heirs to the throne, named since\r\nthe time of Catherine I, have been asked for, and in the explanations a\r\nsort of displeasure was manifested.” To what conclusions the historical\r\nstudy of the measures taken by Peter the Great led Catherine may be seen\r\nfrom the context of the following remarks, written by the empress’ own\r\nhand:\r\n\r\n“It must be acknowledged that the parent is unhappy who sees himself\r\nobliged for the safeguard of the public good to remove his offspring.\r\nThis is a condition which accompanies or is joined to the autocratic and\r\nparental power. And thus I esteem that the most wise monarch Peter I had\r\ndoubtlessly the strongest reasons for the removal of his ungrateful,\r\ndisobedient, and incapable son, who was filled with hatred, malice, and\r\nviperous envy against him. He sought to find some particle of evil in his\r\nfather’s deeds and actions which were conceived in the spirit of good, he\r\nlistened to flatterers, shut his ears to the truth, and nothing was so\r\npleasing to him as to hear his most glorious father defamed and spoken\r\nevil of. He himself was a sluggard, a coward, double-faced, unstable,\r\ngloomy, timid, drunken, passionate, obstinate, bigoted, ignorant man, of\r\nmost mediocre intelligence and of weak health.”\r\n\r\nIndependent of these remarks, Catherine’s ideas are even more clearly\r\nexpressed in other rough draughts concerning the Greek project and\r\nwritten in her own hand. She writes as follows: “Should the successes\r\nof the war give Russia the means and occasion to drive out completely\r\nthe enemies of the name of Christ from the European frontiers, then\r\nRussia, in return for such an entirely Christian service rendered to the\r\nhuman race, would reserve to herself the restoration on the ruins of\r\nthe barbaric power, of the ancient Greek Empire. Russia would promise\r\nto leave such an empire incomplete independence, to entrust and give\r\nit up to the young Russian grand duke Constantine Pavlovitch, who must\r\nthen give his promise not to make in any case any hereditary or other\r\npretensions to the succession of all the Russias, as equally his brother\r\nmust do in regard to the Greek succession.” All these writings clearly\r\ntestify that at the time of the second Turkish war the empress Catherine\r\nhad definitively come to the conclusion that the welfare of the state\r\nrequired the setting aside from the succession of the czarevitch Paul\r\nPetrovitch and his replacement by the grand duke Alexander Pavlovitch.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the czarevitch on his part did all that was possible to\r\njustify in the eyes of Russia Catherine’s intentions to exclude him\r\nfrom the throne. A contemporary who was in close relations with him,\r\nT. V. Rostopschin writes as follows: “It is impossible to see without\r\nshuddering and pity what the grand duke’s father does; it is as if he\r\nsought for every means of inspiring hatred and disgust. He has taken it\r\ninto his head that disrespect and neglect are shown to him; therefore for\r\nthis reason, he catches and cavils at everything and punishes without\r\ndistinction. Every day one only hears of violence, of quarrels about\r\ntrifles of which any private individual would be ashamed. He sees a\r\nrevolution everywhere; he sees Jacobite in everything.”\r\n\r\nCatherine’s correspondence shows that already in the year 1791 the plan\r\nof excluding the czarevitch Paul from the throne was no secret to those\r\nwho were in her intimacy. On the 1st of September, 1791, the empress in\r\na letter to Grimm expresses herself quite definitely on the matter; in\r\nrelating her supposition as to the consequences of the French Revolution,\r\nshe writes: “But this will not be in my time and, I hope, not in the\r\ntime of Alexander.” Finally on the 14th of August, 1792, Catherine\r\ncommunicates to Grimm considerations which allow the nomination of\r\nAlexander as heir to be regarded as a matter settled. “Why should the\r\ncoronation be hurried on?” writes she; “in the words of Solomon there\r\nis a time for everything. First we will marry Alexander, and then we\r\nwill crown him with all possible ceremonies, solemnities, and popular\r\nfestivities. Oh, how happy he will be himself, and how happy others will\r\nbe with him!” The following letter addressed by Catherine to Count V. P.\r\nMussin-Pushkin on the 14th of September, 1792, written by the empress’\r\nown hand, is characteristic of the relations which subsisted at that time\r\nbetween the czarevitch Paul Petrovitch and his mother:\r\n\r\n    COUNT VALENTINE PLATONOVITCH:\r\n\r\n    I herewith enclose a copy of Kushilev’s letter to the governor\r\n    of this town in which he says that the czarevitch has been\r\n    pleased to order that more than half of the Alexandrovski\r\n    square, as the plan sent by him to the governor indicates,\r\n    should be given up to a certain merchant. The order itself is a\r\n    mad one and of the greatest insolence. Tell Kushilev to come to\r\n    you and tell him in my name that if he again dares to send such\r\n    letters anywhere I will send him where the ravens will not have\r\n    to seek for his bones; and tell the grand duke that in future\r\n    he is not to send any orders by you at anyone’s request.\r\n\r\n    September 17th, 1793.\r\n\r\n                                                          CATHERINE.\r\n\r\n    Find out beforehand if this was certainly written by the grand\r\n    duke.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1794 the empress had recourse to decisive measures for the\r\naccomplishment of the projected change and notified to the council her\r\nintention of setting aside her son Paul as her successor giving as\r\nreasons his character and his incapacity. The entire council was ready to\r\nsubmit to this decision, but was stopped by Count V. P. Mussin-Pushkin,\r\nwho said that the character and instincts of the heir might change when\r\nhe became emperor; these remarks put a stop to Catherine’s intention of\r\ndeclaring her grandson Alexander as her successor, and for a time the\r\nmatter rested there. But the opposition that Catherine met with in the\r\ncouncil naturally did not stop her in the pursuit of the aim she had in\r\nview. As has already been observed, obstacles, in her opinion, are only\r\ncreated in order that they may be set aside by persons of merit; guided\r\nby such principles, the empress remained true to herself and to the\r\nmatter that was so close to her heart and continued to seek for fresh\r\nways of carrying through her intentions.[k] Nevertheless all her efforts\r\nfailed in the end, and, as we shall see, Catherine’s son succeeded her in\r\ndue course.[a]\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE LAST OF THE FAVOURITES\r\n\r\nPlato Zubov, the twelfth and last of Catherine’s avowed favourites,\r\nsucceeded in some degree to the position which Potemkin had held as a\r\nsort of vice-emperor. Zubov had superseded Momonov, who, soon wearying of\r\nthe faded charms of a mistress of sixty, became enamoured of the young\r\nprincess Sherbatov, and had the courage to avow it and ask permission to\r\nmarry her. Catherine had pride and generosity enough to grant his request\r\nwithout any reproaches. She saw him married at court to the object of\r\nhis affection, and sent him to Moscow loaded with presents. But it was\r\ncurrently reported that Momonov was so imprudent as to mention to his\r\nwife some particulars of his interviews with the empress, and that she\r\ndivulged them with a levity which Catherine could not forgive. One night,\r\nwhen the husband and wife were gone to rest, the master of the police at\r\nMoscow entered their chamber; and, after showing them an order from her\r\nmajesty, left them in the hands of six women, and retired to an adjoining\r\nroom. Then the six women, or rather the six men dressed as women, seized\r\nthe babbling lady, and having completely stripped her, flogged her\r\nwith rods in the presence of Momonov, whom they forced to kneel down\r\nduring the ceremony. When the chastisement was over, the police-master\r\nre-entered the room and said: “This is the way the empress punishes a\r\nfirst indiscretion. For the second, people are sent to Siberia.”\r\n\r\nIt was in the spring of 1789, when the empress was at Tsarskoi Selo,\r\nthat Momonov was married and dismissed. Lieutenant Zubov commanded the\r\ndetachment of horse-guards in attendance, and being the only young\r\nofficer in sight he owed his preferment to that fortunate circumstance.\r\nNicholas Soltikov, to whom he was distantly related, and who was at that\r\ntime in high credit, took pains to promote his interest, hoping to find\r\nin him a protector against Potemkin, whom he heartily disliked. After\r\nsome secret conferences in presence of the Mentor, Zubov was approved,\r\nand sent for more ample information to Mademoiselle Protasov and the\r\nempress’ physician. The account they gave must have been favourable, for\r\nhe was named aide-de-camp to the empress, received a present of a hundred\r\nthousand roubles (£10,000) to furnish him with linen, and was installed\r\nin the apartment of the favourites with all the customary advantages.\r\n\r\nThe next day this young man was seen familiarly offering his arm to his\r\nsovereign, equipped in his new uniform, with a large hat and feather\r\non his head, attended by his patron and the great men of the empire,\r\nwho walked behind him with their hats off, though the day before he had\r\ndanced attendance in their ante-chambers. His own were now filled with\r\naged generals and ministers of long service, all of whom bent the knee\r\nbefore him. He was a genius discerned by the piercing eye of Catherine;\r\nthe treasures of the empire were lavished on him, and the conduct of the\r\nempress was sanctioned by the meanness and the shameful assiduities of\r\nher courtiers.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Debaucheries at Catherine’s Court_\r\n\r\nThe new favourite was not quite five-and-twenty years old, the empress\r\nwas upwards of sixty. Yet even at this advanced period of her life she\r\nrevived the orgies and lupercalia which she had formerly celebrated with\r\nthe brothers Orlov. Valerian, a younger brother of Zubov, and Peter\r\nSoltikov, their friend, were associated in office with the favourite.\r\nWith these three young libertines did the aged Catherine spend her days,\r\nwhile her armies were slaughtering the Turks, fighting the Swedes, and\r\nravaging Poland; while her people were groaning in wretchedness and\r\nfamine, and devoured by extortioners and tyrants.\r\n\r\nIt was at this time she formed a more intimate society, composed of her\r\nfavourites and most trusty ladies and courtiers. This society met two or\r\nthree times a week, under the name of the Little Hermitage. The parties\r\nwere frequently masqued, and the greatest privacy prevailed. They danced,\r\nplayed at forfeits, joked, romped and engaged in all sorts of frolics\r\nand gambols. Leov Narishkin acted the same part there as Roquelaure at\r\nthe court of Louis XIV; and a fool by title, Matrona Danilovna, seconded\r\nhim. This was an old gossip, whose wit consisted only in uttering the\r\nmost absurd vulgarities; and as she was allowed the common right of\r\nfools, that of saying anything, she was loaded with presents by the lower\r\norder of courtiers. Such foreign ministers as enjoyed the favour of the\r\nempress were sometimes admitted to the Little Hermitage. Ségur, Cobenzl,\r\nStedingk, and Nassau chiefly enjoyed this distinction; but Catherine\r\nafterwards formed another assembly, more confined and more mysterious,\r\nwhich was called the Little Society. The three favourites of whom we have\r\njust been speaking, Branicka, Protasov, and some confidential women and\r\nvalets-de-chambre, were its only members. In this the Cybele of the north\r\ncelebrated her most secret mysteries. The particulars of these amusements\r\nare not fit to be repeated.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [1793 A.D.]]\r\n\r\nCatherine survived Potemkin but four years. The last ten years of her\r\nreign carried her power, her glory, and her political crimes to their\r\nhighest pitch. When the great Frederick, dictator of the kings of Europe,\r\ndied, she remained the eldest of the crowned heads of the continent; and\r\nif we except Joseph, all those heads together were unequal to her own.\r\nIf Frederick was the dictator of these kings, Catherine became their\r\ntyrant. The immense empire which she had subjected to her sway; the\r\ninexhaustible resources she derived from a country and a people as yet in\r\na state of infancy; the extreme luxury of her court, the barbarous pomp\r\nof her nobility, the wealth and princely grandeur of her favourites, the\r\nglorious exploits of her armies, and the gigantic views of her ambition\r\nthrew Europe into a sort of fascination; and those monarchs who had\r\nbeen too proud to pay each other even the slightest deference felt no\r\nabasement in making a woman the arbiter of their interests, the ruling\r\npower of all their measures.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SUBJUGATION AND FINAL PARTITION OF POLAND (1796 A.D.)\r\n\r\nThe annihilation of Poland, long meditated, was now resolved on. The\r\nempress could never forgive that nation either for the act of the diet\r\nin 1788, which abrogated the constitution dictated by violence in 1775,\r\nor the alliance of Prussia accepted in contempt of her own, or, above\r\nall, the constitution decreed at Warsaw on the 3rd of May, 1791. Big with\r\nthese ideas of revenge, she gave orders to Bulgakov, her minister at\r\nWarsaw, to declare war against Poland.\r\n\r\nThe diet being assembled received this declaration with a majestic\r\ncalmness, which was rapidly succeeded by the generous enthusiasm of a\r\nnation roused to self-defence. The king himself pretended to share the\r\nfeelings that animated his people; and the Poles had the weakness to\r\nbelieve that, having abandoned his former servility to Russia and his\r\ncustomary indolence, he was becoming the defender of their freedom. An\r\narmy was collected in haste, and the command of it given to the king’s\r\nnephew, Joseph Poniatowski, an inexperienced young man, all of whose\r\nefforts were obstructed or misdirected by his traitorous uncle.\r\n\r\nThe Poles could have opposed the designs of Catherine with an army of\r\nfifty thousand men; but they never yet could be brought to unite their\r\nforces; and their different corps were soon after pressed between an\r\narmy of eighty thousand Russians, who fell back from Bessarabia upon the\r\nterritory which extends along the Bug, another of ten thousand collected\r\nin the environs of Kiev, and a third of thirty thousand, which had\r\npenetrated into Lithuania.\r\n\r\nWe shall not here attempt to draw the picture of the various battles that\r\ndrenched the plains of Poland with blood, and which, notwithstanding some\r\nadvantages obtained by the Poles, consumed the greater part of their\r\ntroops. It was then that the illustrious Kosciuszko, who as yet was\r\nnothing more than one of the lieutenants of young Joseph Poniatowski,\r\ndisplayed qualities that justly obtained him the confidence of the\r\nnation, the hatred of the Russians, and the esteem of Europe.\r\n\r\nDuring all this time Catherine, not trusting alone to the power of her\r\nown arms, had been negotiating with unremitted assiduity. She proposed\r\nthe definitive partition of Poland to Frederick William, who was\r\nundoubtedly no less desirous of it than herself. She secretly won over to\r\nher views the two brothers Kassakovski, the hetman Branicki, Rejevuski,\r\nand particularly Felix Potocki, who, while flattering himself perhaps\r\nwith the hopes of mounting the throne of Poland, became only the slave of\r\nRussia. She even insisted that Stanislaus Augustus should make a public\r\ndeclaration that it was necessary to yield to the superiority of the\r\nRussian arms. He submitted to this indignity; but was not on that account\r\ntreated by the empress with greater indulgence.\r\n\r\nIn 1793 the confederation of the partisans of Russia assembled at Grodno,\r\nwhere the Russian general proudly seated himself under the canopy of the\r\nthrone he was about to overturn. The Russian minister Sievers, at the\r\nsame time, published a manifesto (April 9th) in which he declared that\r\nhis sovereign would incorporate with her dominions all the territory of\r\nPoland which her arms had conquered. The king of Prussia, in concert with\r\nCatherine, had already marched an army into Poland.\r\n\r\nThe Russians, dispersed about the provinces of that kingdom, committed\r\ndepredations and ravages of which history furnishes but few examples.\r\nWarsaw became likewise the theatre of their excesses. The Russian general\r\nIgelström, who governed that city, connived at the disorders of his\r\nsoldiers, and made the wretched inhabitants feel the whole weight of his\r\narrogance and barbarity. The defenders of Poland had been obliged to\r\ndisperse. Their property was confiscated; their families were reduced\r\nto servitude. Goaded by so many calamities, they once more took the\r\nresolution to free their country of the Russians. Some of them assembled,\r\nand sent an invitation to Kosciuszko to come and put himself at their\r\nhead. That general had retired to Leipsic, with Hugh Kolonti, Zajonchek,\r\nand Ignatius Potocki, a man of great knowledge and sagacity, a sincere\r\nfriend to his country, and in all respects the opposite of his cousin\r\nFelix. These four Poles joined eagerly in the resolution adopted by their\r\nhonest countrymen: but they were sensible that, in order to succeed, they\r\nmust begin by giving liberty to the peasants, who till then had been\r\ntreated in Poland like beasts of burden.\r\n\r\nKosciuszko and Zajonchek repaired, with all expedition, to the frontiers\r\nof Poland. The latter proceeded to Warsaw, where he had conferences\r\nwith the chiefs of the conspirators. A banker named Kapustas, a bold\r\nand artful man, made himself responsible for the inhabitants of the\r\ncapital. He saw likewise several officers, who declared their detestation\r\nof the Russian yoke. All, in short, was ripe for an insurrection, when\r\nthe Russian commanders, to whom Kosciuszko’s presence on the frontiers\r\nhad given umbrage, forced him to postpone it for a time. To throw the\r\nRussians off their guard, Kosciuszko went into Italy, and Zajonchek to\r\nDresden, whither Ignatius Potocki and Kolonti had retired, but all at\r\nonce Zajonchek appeared again at Warsaw. The king himself impeached him\r\nto the Russian general Igelström, who had a conference with him, and\r\nordered him to quit the Polish territory. No alternative now remained for\r\nhim but to proceed immediately to action, or to abandon the enterprise\r\naltogether. Zajonchek resolved on the former.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [1794 A.D.]]\r\n\r\nIn 1794 Kosciuszko was recalled from Italy, and arrived at Cracow, where\r\nthe Poles received him as their deliverer. In spite of the orders of\r\nthe Russians, Colonel Madalinski pertinaciously refused to disband his\r\nregiment. Some other officers had joined him. Kosciuszko was proclaimed\r\ngeneral of his little army, amounting to three thousand foot and twelve\r\nhundred horse; and the act of insurrection was almost immediately\r\npublished on the 24th of March. Three hundred peasants, armed with\r\nscythes, ranged themselves under the standard of Kosciuszko. That general\r\nsoon found himself faced by seven thousand Russians, who were put to\r\nflight after a vigourous resistance.\r\n\r\nOn hearing at Warsaw of the success of Kosciuszko, the Russian general\r\nIgelström caused all those to be arrested whom he suspected to have any\r\nconcern in the insurrection; but these measures served only the more to\r\nirritate the conspirators. The insurrection broke out on the 18th of\r\nApril. Two thousand Russians were put to the sword. Their general, being\r\nbesieged in his house, requested permission to capitulate; and profiting\r\nby the delay that was granted him, he escaped to the Prussian camp, which\r\nlay at a little distance from Warsaw. Vilna, the capital of Lithuania,\r\nfollowed the example of Warsaw; but the triumph of the insurgents was\r\nthere less terrible. Colonel Iazinski, who was at their head, conducted\r\nhimself with so much skill, that he took all the Russians prisoners,\r\nwithout shedding a drop of blood. The inhabitants of the cantons of Chelm\r\nand of Lublin declared themselves also in a state of insurrection, and\r\nwere imitated by three Polish regiments who were employed in the service\r\nof the Russians. Some of the principal partisans of Russia, the hetman\r\nKassakovski, the bishop his brother, Zabiello, Ozarovski, and Ankvitch\r\nwere sentenced to be hanged, the first at Vilna, and the others at\r\nWarsaw.\r\n\r\nKosciuszko exerted himself to the utmost to augment his army. He got\r\nrecruits among the peasants; and to inspire them with more emulation he\r\nwore their dress, ate with them, and distributed encouragements among\r\nthem; but those men too long degraded in Poland were not yet deserving of\r\nthe liberty that was offered them. They distrusted the intentions of the\r\nnobles, who, on their side, for the most part lamented the loss of their\r\nabsurd prerogatives. Stanislaus Augustus and his partisans augmented\r\nstill further the ill-will of the nobles, by representing to them the\r\nintentions of Kosciuszko as disastrous to their order, and by caballing\r\ncontinually in favour of Russia.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [1795 A.D.]]\r\n\r\nIn the mean time, the empress, not satisfied with augmenting the number\r\nof her troops in Poland, had sent her best generals thither. After\r\nseveral battles, in one of which Frederick William, who had advanced\r\nto support the Russians, fought at the head of his troops against\r\nKosciuszko, who was striving to prevent the junction of the Russian\r\ngenerals, Suvarov and Fersen, the Polish commander was attacked by the\r\nlatter at Macziewice on the 4th of October. His talents, his valour,\r\nand his desperation were unable to prevent the Poles from yielding to\r\nnumbers. Almost the whole of his army were cut to pieces or obliged to\r\nlay down their arms. He himself, covered with wounds, was taken prisoner,\r\nejaculating, “_Finis Poloniæ!_”\r\n\r\nAll who were able to escape from the conquerors went and shut themselves\r\nup in Praga, the eastern suburb of Warsaw, where 26,000 Poles and 104\r\nheavy cannon and mortars defended the bridges over the Vistula and the\r\napproach to the capital. Suvarov was soon before the gates with an\r\neffective force of but 22,000 men and 86 field pieces; but even with\r\nsuch odds against him he resolved to do as he had done at Ismail, and\r\ncarry the Polish lines at the point of the bayonet. After cannonading the\r\ndefences for two days he gave the order for the assault at daybreak on\r\nthe 4th of November. The trenches were carried after a desperate fight of\r\nfive hours; the Russians swept into the town, murdering all before them,\r\nold men, women, and children; the wooden houses were speedily on fire;\r\nthe bridges were broken down, so that the helpless crowds who attempted\r\nto escape into the city were remorselessly driven into the Vistula.\r\nBesides 10,000 Polish soldiers, 12,000 citizens of every age and sex\r\nperished in this wanton butchery.\r\n\r\nWarsaw itself capitulated on the 5th of November, and was delivered up to\r\nthe Russians on the 6th. Poland was now annihilated. One division of its\r\ntroops after another was disarmed, and all the generals and officers who\r\ncould be seized were carried off. The king, however, who could be induced\r\nto do anything if his comforts were spared, was used as an instrument to\r\ngive to power the impress of right. He was again set nominally at the\r\nhead of the kingdom till the robbers had agreed upon the division of the\r\nspoil, and had no longer need of him. Suvarov held a splendid military\r\ncourt for a year in Warsaw, far eclipsing the king, till at length the\r\ncity was given up to the Prussians.\r\n\r\nThe whole of the year 1795 was spent in negotiations with Prussia, and\r\nthe last treaty for the partition of Poland was not signed till the 24th\r\nof October, 1795. In December, Suvarov travelled from Warsaw to St.\r\nPetersburg, where the empress appropriated the Taurian palace for his\r\nresidence, and nominated a special household for his service. On the\r\n1st of January, 1796, Warsaw was first given up to the Prussians, and\r\nnegotiations were carried on till the 21st of October, 1796, respecting\r\nthe boundaries of the palatinates of Warsaw and Cracow. By virtue of this\r\npartition, first finally arranged in October, 1796, Austria obtained the\r\nchief parts of the waiwodeship of Cracow, the palatinates of Sendomir and\r\nLublin, together with a portion of the district of Chelm and portions\r\nof the waiwodeships of Brzesc, Podalachia, and Massovia, which lie\r\nalong the left bank of the Bug. All these districts contain about 834\r\nGerman square miles. Prussia received those portions of Massovia and\r\nPodalachia which touch upon the right bank of that river, in Lithuania\r\nthose parts of the palatinates of Troki and Samogitia which lie to the\r\nleft of the Niemen, and, finally, a district in Little Poland which\r\nbelonged to the waiwodeship of Cracow, making in all about one thousand\r\nGerman square miles. Russia received the whole of what had hitherto\r\nbeen Polish Lithuania as far as the Niemen, and to the frontiers of the\r\nwaiwodeships of Brzesc and Novogrodek, and thence to the Bug, together\r\nwith the greater part of Samogitia. In Little Poland she obtained that\r\npart of Chelm which lies on the right bank of the Bug and the remainder\r\nof Volhinia, in all about two thousand German square miles. During the\r\nnegotiations for the partition, Russia caused Stanislaus Augustus to lay\r\ndown the crown. The three partitioning powers ensured him a yearly income\r\nof 200,000 ducats, and promised to pay his debts.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ANNEXATION OF COURLAND (1795 A.D.)\r\n\r\nCatherine had now conquered, either by her arms or by her intrigues,\r\nalmost one-half of Poland, the Crimea, the Kuban, and a part of the\r\nfrontiers of Turkey. But she had no need of armaments and battles for\r\nusurping another rich and well-peopled country. Courland and Semigallia,\r\nwhere still reigned Duke Peter, the feeble son of the famous Biren, had\r\nlong been prepared for that annexation, which was now effected almost\r\nwithout an effort. The flattering reception given to the Courish nobles\r\nin St. Petersburg by the empress, distinctions, honours, posts, and\r\npleasures, rendering their abode in the imperial residence far preferable\r\nto continuing in Mittau, and made them desirous of being under the sway\r\nof the sovereign of a vast empire, rather than live in obedience to\r\na duke the obscurity of whose origin they could not forget, and whom\r\nthey regarded as their inferior. To bring the people to the same way of\r\nthinking as the nobles, Catherine artfully embroiled them with their\r\nneighbours, and created for them reasons of alarm.\r\n\r\nShe began by instigating the inhabitants of Livonia to insist upon the\r\nfulfilment of an ancient convention, by which the Courlanders were\r\nobliged to bring all their merchandises to Riga: certainly a very strange\r\nand hard condition, by which a nation, that had on its coasts excellent\r\nharbours happily situated, should be obliged to go, at a great expense,\r\nto embark the products of its soil in a foreign city. The quarrel between\r\nthe Livonians and the Courlanders was not yet terminated, when the\r\nempress sent engineers into Courland, to mark out a canal, to facilitate\r\nthe transport of the merchandises of that country into Livonia. The\r\nCourlanders seeing this, and fearing lest they should be soon forced\r\nto make use of this canal, thought it better for them to be protected\r\nthan oppressed by the empress, and to be her subjects rather than her\r\nneighbours.\r\n\r\nCatherine, being informed of these dispositions, called the duke of\r\nCourland to her, under the pretence of conferring with him on matters of\r\nimportance. No sooner was that prince at the foot of the throne of the\r\nautocratrix of the north, than the states of Courland held an assembly,\r\nwherein it was proposed to put the country under the supremacy of Russia.\r\nThe principal members of the grand council faintly opposed this motion,\r\nobserving, that before they proceeded to a resolution it would be\r\nexpedient to wait the return of the duke. The oberburgraf Hoven rose up,\r\nand spoke a long time in favour of Russia. Some councillors expressed\r\nthemselves of his opinion; others reproached him with treason. The\r\ndispute grew warm on both sides; challenges were reciprocally given and\r\nswords were about to be drawn, when the Russian general Pahlen appeared\r\nin the assembly. His presence restored tranquillity. No one presumed\r\nto raise his voice against Russia; and the proposal of the nobles was\r\nadopted.\r\n\r\nThe next day, March 18th, 1795, the act was drawn up, by which\r\nCourland, Semigallia, and the circle of Pilten made a formal surrender\r\nof themselves to the empress of Russia; and it was carried to St.\r\nPetersburg, where the duke of Courland learned, from the mouth of his own\r\nsubjects, that they themselves had deprived him of his dominions. The\r\nempress immediately sent a governor thither. Some discontent, however,\r\nremained in Courland; discontent brought on proscription, and the\r\npossessions of the proscribed were given to the courtiers of Catherine.\r\nThe favourite, Plato Zubov, and his brother Valerian obtained a great\r\npart of those rich and shameful spoils.[j]\r\n\r\n\r\nLAST YEARS AND DEATH OF CATHERINE\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CATHERINE II\r\n\r\n(1729-1796)]\r\n\r\nBefore the breaking out of the French Revolution the governments of\r\nLouis XVI and Catherine II had entered into active negotiations for\r\nthe formation of a quadruple alliance that should include Austria,\r\nRussia, and the two houses of Bourbon, and should have for its object\r\nthe checking of England’s maritime pretensions and the encroachments of\r\nPrussia. After the taking of the Bastille Catherine realised that she\r\ncould no longer count upon the support of France, since that country\r\nwas exclusively occupied with its own interior transformation. She\r\nkept anxious watch, however, upon the course of events in Paris, and\r\nmanifested the liveliest antipathy to the new principles, falling ill\r\nat the news of the king’s execution on the 21st of January. Led by fear\r\ninto a violent reaction, the correspondent of Voltaire and Diderot set\r\na close watch upon all Russians suspected of liberalism. She destroyed\r\na tragedy of Kniaznin and exiled to Siberia Radichtchev, the author of\r\na curious book entitled _Journey from St. Petersburg to Moscow_, in\r\nwhich were many sharp reflections on serfdom; Novikov was confined at\r\nSchlüsselburg, his printing houses were closed and all his enterprises\r\nruined. She dismissed Genêt, the French ambassador, refused to recognise\r\neither the constitution of 1791 or the French Republic, issued an ukase\r\nannouncing the rupture of diplomatic relations with France, refused to\r\nthe tri-colour admission to Russian parts, expelled all French subjects\r\nwho refused to swear allegiance to the monarchical principle, extended a\r\nwarm welcome to French refugees, and lost no time in acknowledging Louis\r\nXVIII.\r\n\r\nIn 1792 she published her famous note on the restoration of royal power\r\nand aristocratic privileges in France, asserting that only ten thousand\r\nmen would be necessary to effect a counter-revolution. She encouraged\r\nGustavus III, who was assassinated by his nobles at a masked ball (March\r\n16th, 1792), to place himself at the head of a crusade against democracy.\r\nShe further urged England to assist the count d’Artois in a descent he\r\nhad planned upon the French coast, and stimulated the zeal of Austria\r\nand Prussia. Notwithstanding this, though she had repeatedly negotiated\r\ntreaties for subsidies and promised troops, she took care never to become\r\ninvolved in a war with the west. “My position is taken,” she said, “my\r\npart assigned; I shall watch the movements of Turkey, Poland, and Sweden.”\r\n\r\nThe latter country became reconciled to France after the death of\r\nGustavus III. The punishment of the Jacobins of Warsaw and Turkey was an\r\neasier and more lucrative piece of work. We should also take into account\r\nan admission that she made to her vice-chancellor Ostermann in 1791: “Am\r\nI wrong? I cannot avow all to the courts of Berlin and Vienna, but I wish\r\nto keep them engaged in these affairs so that I may have freedom to carry\r\non my unfinished enterprises.” She excused herself for not taking part in\r\nthe anti-revolutionary crusade by alleging the war with Turkey; then when\r\nin consequence of the revolution of the 3rd of May she was obliged to\r\nhasten the Peace of Jassy, she made the Polish war her excuse; and when\r\nthis was ended she affected to excite Suvarov and his soldiers against\r\nthe atheists of the west, but in reality thought only of gaining her own\r\nends in the east. Muhammed, the new king of Persia, had recently invaded\r\nGeorgia and burned Tiflis, the capital of Heraclius, a protégé of the\r\nempress. Catherine summoned to her court an exiled brother of Muhammed’s\r\nand charged Valerian Zubov with the conquest of Persia. [His armies were\r\nactually under way when the death of Catherine led to the abandonment of\r\nthe enterprise.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [1796 A.D.]]\r\n\r\nWithout being aware of it Catherine II really performed greater service\r\nto France than to the coalition. By her intervention in Poland and her\r\nprojects against the east she had excited the jealousy and suspicion of\r\nPrussia and Austria. She took care to pit them against each other; made\r\nthe second partition with Frederick William in spite of Austria, and\r\neffected the third with Francis II to the extreme dissatisfaction of\r\nPrussia. She contributed indirectly to weaken and dissolve the coalition,\r\nbeing herself prevented from joining it by the Polish insurrection that\r\nreceived so much encouragement from France. She died on the 17th of\r\nNovember, 1796, at the age of sixty-seven. Since Ivan the Terrible no\r\nmonarch had extended the limits of the empire by such vast conquests.\r\nCatherine made the Niemen, the Dniester, and the Black Sea the boundaries\r\nof Russia.[d]\r\n\r\n\r\nA RUSSIAN ESTIMATE OF CATHERINE\r\n\r\nThe personality of the empress was as though created for a throne. We do\r\nnot meet in history with any other woman so fitted to rule. On all and\r\neach she produced a profound impression. No one has spoken more harshly\r\nand disadvantageously of the empress’ qualities than Masson, yet this\r\npamphleteer-writer observes that during the space of ten years, having\r\nhad occasion to see Catherine once or twice a week, he was always struck\r\nby her unusually attractive personality, by the dignity with which she\r\nheld herself, and by the amiability of her behaviour to everyone.\r\n\r\nIn her _Memoirs_[g] Catherine herself has left a detailed narrative of\r\nthe course of her development, of her aspirations after power, and of her\r\nunscrupulousness in the means she used to attain her aims. The empress’\r\nfrankness in this respect amounts almost to cynicism. In maturity she at\r\nlast became an autocratic sovereign. After the terrible humiliations, the\r\nbitter trials she had endured in her youth, her delight when she found\r\nherself in the enjoyment of unbounded power was all the greater. The\r\nfact that the fundamental change in her surroundings, the rapid passage\r\nfrom entire dependency to entire potency, did not in any wise awaken\r\nin her any despotic inclinations testifies to the goodness inherent in\r\nher nature; when her son was subjected in his turn to a like change in\r\noutward circumstances his despotism knew no bounds.\r\n\r\nWe have seen that the unfavourable circumstances in which Catherine\r\nfound herself until the year 1762 exercised a baneful influence upon\r\nher character; whereas the power and preponderance which she later\r\nacquired had an ennobling effect upon her nature. Until then she had been\r\nnecessarily obliged often to have resource to mean and trifling measures\r\nto better her position and to revenge herself on her opponents; when she\r\nwas able to exert full power, to enjoy the advantages of her position,\r\nthe respect of her contemporaries, the adoration of the persons that\r\nsurrounded her, she no longer needed to employ those means which are\r\ngenerally made use of by the weak in their struggle against the strong.\r\nAt the time when a sharp watch was kept over her, when she was not\r\ntrusted by either Elizabeth or Peter, she understood how to dissemble,\r\nto play the hypocrite, to feign humility and modesty, whilst in her soul\r\nshe was filled with arrogance and contempt for mankind. Now that she had\r\nsurrounded herself entirely with persons devoted to her she could act\r\nopenly and nobly. The grand duchess in her isolation had been remarkable\r\nfor her coldness, her mistrust of mankind, her suspiciousness; the\r\nempress on the contrary gave full scope to the development of feelings\r\nof benevolence, condescension, indulgence, and sincere attention to the\r\ninterests of the persons that surrounded her. It was not without reason\r\nthat Peter and Elizabeth had mistrusted Catherine and been suspicious of\r\nher character; it was not without reason, either, that in after times\r\nmany people highly esteemed Catherine’s kindheartedness.\r\n\r\nThe history of the court under Peter I, under the empress Anna, and under\r\nElizabeth is full of examples of tyranny, cruelty, and arbitrariness;\r\nall Catherine’s contemporaries were astonished at the mildness of her\r\nbehaviour to those around her and rejoiced at the absence of stiff\r\nformalities and hard measures in her intercourse with her subordinates.\r\nIn spite of her quick temper and impulsiveness, Catherine had complete\r\ncontrol over herself, and in her intercourse with her fellow creatures\r\nshe was governed by principles of humanity. “I like to praise and reward\r\nloudly, to blame quietly,” she once justly remarked in conversation\r\nwith Ségur; she sought to avoid occasions of offending anyone, and was\r\nparticularly careful in her intercourse with servants; “I will live to\r\nmake myself not feared,” she once said, observing that the stove-heater,\r\nwho had deserved reproof for some neglect, avoided meeting her. Often\r\nwhen Catherine had given an order she would make excuses for the trouble\r\nand labour it occasioned. Krapovitski gives instances of such solicitude\r\non her part; more than once the empress, when impatient or irritated,\r\nhaving expressed herself somewhat sharply, afterwards acknowledged her\r\nhastiness and endeavoured to repair her fault.\r\n\r\nIt is said that Catherine, who awoke early and usually rose at six in\r\nthe morning, so valued the tranquillity of her servants that without\r\nrequiring assistance she dressed herself, lit the fire, and without\r\ndisturbing anyone sat down to her books and papers. Various anecdotes\r\nare to be found in the narratives of contemporaries testifying to her\r\nindulgence to her servants and her want of sufficient severity in her\r\nintercourse with them. When she was in a passion she turned up her\r\nsleeves, walked about the room, drank a glass of water, and deferred\r\njudgment. Her capacity for removing any misunderstanding that might\r\nhave arisen between herself and others was particularly remarkable. In\r\nher letters to various great lords we meet with frequent exhortations\r\nnot to give way to despair but to take courage, to believe in their own\r\ncapacities, and to hope for success. In moments of danger she knew how to\r\nraise the spirits of those around her, inspiring them with firmness and\r\ncourage.\r\n\r\nThe distinguishing features of Catherine’s character were gaiety, humour,\r\nand an inclination for fun and amusements. She once remarked: “As to the\r\ngaiety of character of Frederick the Great, it must be observed that\r\nit proceeded from his superiority: was there ever a great man who was\r\nnot distinguished by his gaiety and who did not possess in himself an\r\ninexhaustible store of it.” She took the greatest pleasure in going to\r\nmasquerades and, while preserving the strictest incognito, talking to\r\nvarious people; she herself related in detail how she had once gone to a\r\nmasquerade in male attire and had made a declaration of love to a young\r\ngirl who never suspected that it was the empress talking to her. It must\r\nnot be regarded as a matter of chance or an act of complaisance that such\r\na multitude of anecdotes testifying to the magnanimity of Catherine have\r\nbeen preserved; many contemporaries who do not unconditionally praise\r\nher maintain however that she was capable of listening to unpleasing\r\ntruths, of recognising her faults and deficiencies, and of restraining\r\nher anger. Such assertions are to be met with in Razumovski, Derjavin,\r\nMussin-Pushkin, and Teplov.\r\n\r\nOf course traits are not wanting which show her obstinacy, self-will,\r\nand arrogance. Derjavin cites several circumstances to prove that in\r\nher actions Catherine was often governed by personal considerations and\r\ndesires rather than the real good of the state and strict justice. It\r\nis also not without reason that she is reproached with the fact that,\r\nwhile protesting against the use of tortures and corporal punishment,\r\nshe allowed full scope to the cruelties of Sheshkovski who frequently\r\nwith his own hand tortured accused persons in the most atrocious manner;\r\nwe cannot however determine how far the empress was cognisant of his\r\nbarbarous treatment. Referring to some instances of arbitrariness and\r\ninfringement of the law, Prince Sherbatov remarks that the empress held\r\nherself above the law and that she thus herself set a pernicious example\r\nto the great noblemen and dignitaries who imitated her in this respect.\r\n\r\nAs to Catherine’s piety, Frederick II plainly accused her of hypocrisy\r\nand bigotry. We bear in mind that it was not easy for her to adopt the\r\northodox faith, but that when she had adopted it she used outward piety\r\nas a means of strengthening her position in Russia. By strictly observing\r\nthe rules of the church, and conscientiously fulfilling her religious\r\nduties, she endeavoured to produce a certain impression on her subjects.\r\nAt the same time she remained true to the principles of toleration\r\npreached in the literature of enlightenment. When Voltaire reproached\r\nher, saying that she humiliated herself by kissing the priest’s hand,\r\nshe justified herself by replying that it was only an outward observance\r\nwhich would little by little become obsolete. There is no doubt that\r\nCatherine’s piety did not spring from any deep feeling. In her letters to\r\nGrimm, sallies against Luther and the Lutherans are to be met with more\r\nthan once; she despised Lutherans for their intolerance and several times\r\npraised the orthodox faith as the best in the world; she compared it to\r\nan oak tree with deep roots.\r\n\r\nSide by side with such remarks we meet with bold sallies both from the\r\nlips and in the letters of the empress against excessive piety and\r\nfanaticism; such are certain caustic remarks referring to Maria Theresa\r\nand the queen of Portugal. In certain _jeux d’esprit_ which she allowed\r\nherself in connection with questions of the church and religion in her\r\nletters to Grimm, the same rationalism is to be observed as that which\r\ndistinguished the votaries of French literature of the time. Catherine\r\npraised the works of Nicholas Sebaldus Nothanker, especially, because\r\nhypocrisy was condemned in them. Deep religious and philosophical\r\nquestions she did not like; her chief characteristic was a certain\r\nworldliness. Her point of view was optimistic and her principal rule\r\nof earthly wisdom, gaiety. She did not like to meditate on sad events,\r\nto give way to grief, to dwell upon gloomy subjects; and this partly\r\nexplains her esteem for Voltaire, whom she called the “god of gaiety.”\r\nThis playfulness and vivacity, this freshness and gaiety she preserved to\r\nthe end of her life.[h]\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES\r\n\r\n[54] The Swedes were not aware of the fortuitous advantage then offered\r\nthem by a singular incident. Just before the Russian admiral received\r\norders to weigh, the empress had given the command of a ship to the\r\nfamous Paul Jones. As soon as the British officers in the Russian service\r\nheard of this appointment, they repaired in a body to the admiralty, and\r\nannounced their determination to quit the squadron to which that pirate\r\nhad been attached. By this act on their part seven or eight ships were\r\nleft without officers, until the empress, smothering her resentment,\r\nwithdrew Paul Jones from the squadron, under pretence of sending him to\r\nthe Black Sea; but, fearing a repetition of so unpleasant a scene, she\r\ncontrived to get rid of the daring adventurer altogether.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX. RUSSIA IN THE NAPOLEONIC EPOCH\r\n\r\n    Perhaps no sovereign since the days of the Antonines ever\r\n    was called to higher destinies, or more worthily filled an\r\n    important place in the theatre of the world, than the emperor\r\n    Alexander I. Placed at the head of the most powerful and\r\n    rising empire in existence, stationed midway between ancient\r\n    civilisation and barbaric vigour, he was called to take the\r\n    lead in the great struggle for European freedom; to combat\r\n    with the energy and enthusiasm of the desert the superiority\r\n    of advanced information, and meet the condensed military force\r\n    of a revolution, which had beaten down all the strength of\r\n    continental power, with the dauntless resolution and enduring\r\n    fortitude which arise in the earlier ages of social existence.\r\n    Well and nobly he fulfilled his destiny. Repeatedly defeated,\r\n    never subdued, he took counsel, like his great predecessor\r\n    Peter, from misfortune, and prepared in silence those\r\n    invincible bands which, in the day of trial, hurled back the\r\n    most terrible array which ambition had ever marshalled against\r\n    the liberties of mankind.--ALISON.[f]\r\n\r\n\r\nEARLY MEASURES OF THE REIGN OF PAUL I\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [1796-1815 A.D.]]\r\n\r\nThe emperor Paul I, Catherine’s successor, had been long known for\r\nhis singularities, his great dislike of the French, and to everything\r\nwhich Catherine had done. He appeared desirous of proceeding directly\r\non the very opposite course to that which she had followed. She had\r\nchiefly directed her attention to foreign relations and affairs, whilst\r\nhe appeared to occupy his mind solely with the internal state of his\r\ndominions. His very first act was a proof that he was quite ready to\r\ngo in opposition to all the ordinary rules of political prudence, and\r\nwhen under the influence of his humour to follow his views, reckless\r\nof consequences. He caused splendid funeral honours and services to be\r\nperformed for his murdered father, and forced the audacious and godless,\r\nthough clever criminals, who had helped to place his mother on the\r\nthrone, to be publicly exposed to the gaze of the people. Notwithstanding\r\nthis, he suffered them to remain in possession of their honours and\r\nestates, whilst he designated them as murderers, and reminded the people\r\nthat his mother had taken part in the murder of his father. The body of\r\nPeter III, which had been deposited in the convent of Alexander Nevski,\r\nwas by his orders placed beside that of his wife; and it was notified by\r\nan inscription in the Russian language that, though separated in life, in\r\ndeath they were united.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [1796 A.D.]]\r\n\r\nAlexis Orlov and Prince Baratinski, two of the murderous band, were\r\ncompelled to come to St. Petersburg to accompany the funeral procession\r\non foot, but they were not so treated as to prevent them afterwards from\r\ndoing further mischief. Alexis obtained permission to travel in foreign\r\ncountries. Baratinski was ordered never again to show himself at court;\r\nwhich, under existing circumstances, could not to him be otherwise than\r\nan agreeable command. Single proofs of tender feeling, of a noble heart,\r\nand touching goodness, nay even the emperor’s magnanimous conduct towards\r\nKosciuszko and his brethren in arms, combined with his sympathy with the\r\nfate of Poland, could not reconcile a court, such as that of Russia under\r\nCatherine II had become, and a city like that of St. Petersburg, to the\r\nchange of the court into a guard-room, and to the daily varying humours\r\nof a man of eccentric and half-deranged mind. Even the improvements in\r\nthe financial affairs of the country were regarded as ruinous innovations\r\nby those who in times past had profited by the confusion. The whole of\r\nRussia, and even the imperial family, were alarmed and terrified; a\r\ncomplete flood of decrees, often contradictory, and mutually abrogatory,\r\nfollowed one another in quick succession; and the mad schemes of the\r\nemperor, who was, nevertheless, by no means wicked or insensible to what\r\nwas good and true, reminded all observers of the most unhappy times of\r\ndeclining Rome.[b]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Imperial Eccentricities_\r\n\r\nThe guards, that dangerous body of men who had overturned the throne of\r\nthe father, and who had long considered the accession of the son as the\r\nterm of their military existence, were rendered incapable of injuring him\r\nby a bold and vigourous step, and treated without the least deference\r\nfrom the first day. Paul incorporated in the different regiments of\r\nguards his battalions that arrived from Gatshina, the officers of which\r\nhe distributed among the various companies, promoting them at the same\r\ntime two or three steps; so that simple lieutenants or captains in\r\nthe army found themselves at once captains in the guards, a place so\r\nimportant and hitherto so honoured, and which gave the rank of colonel,\r\nor even of brigadier. Some of the old captains of the first families in\r\nthe kingdom found themselves under the command of officers of no birth,\r\nwho but a few years before had left their companies, as sergeants or\r\ncorporals, to enter into the battalions of the grand duke. This bold\r\nand hasty change, which at any other time would have been fatal to its\r\nauthor, had only the effect of inducing a few hundreds of officers,\r\nsubalterns and others, to retire.\r\n\r\nPaul, alarmed and enraged at this general desertion, went to the\r\nbarracks, flattered the soldiers, appeased the officers, and endeavoured\r\nto retain them by excluding from all employ, civil and military, those\r\nwho should retire in future. He afterwards issued an order that every\r\nofficer or subaltern who had resigned, or should give in his resignation,\r\nshould quit the capital within four-and-twenty hours, and return to\r\nhis own home. It did not enter into the head of the person who drew up\r\nthe ukase that it contained an absurdity; for several of the officers\r\nwere natives of St. Petersburg, and had families residing in the city.\r\nAccordingly, some of them retired to their homes without quitting the\r\ncapital, not obeying the first part of the order, lest they should be\r\nfound guilty of disobedience to the second. Arkarov, who was to see\r\nit put in force, having informed the emperor of this contradiction,\r\ndirected that the injunction to quit St. Petersburg should alone be\r\nobeyed. A number of young men were consequently taken out of their houses\r\nas criminals, put out of the city, with orders not to re-enter it, and\r\nleft in the road without shelter, and without any furred garments, in\r\nvery severe weather. Those who belonged to very remote provinces, for\r\nthe most part wanting money to carry them thither, wandered about the\r\nneighbourhood of St. Petersburg, where several perished from cold and\r\nwant.\r\n\r\nThe finances of the empire, exhausted by the prodigalities and still more\r\nby the waste of Catherine’s reign, required a prompt remedy; and to this\r\nPaul seemed at first to turn his thoughts. Partly from hope, partly from\r\nfear, the paper money of the crown rose a little in value. It was to be\r\nsupposed that the grand duke of all the Russias, who for thirty years had\r\nbeen obliged to live on an income of a hundred thousand rubles (£10,000)\r\nper annum, would at least have learned economy per force; but he was soon\r\nseen to rush into the most unmeasured sumptuosity, heap wealth upon some,\r\nand lavish favours upon others, with as much profusion as his mother, and\r\nwith still less discernment. The spoils of Poland continued to add to\r\nthe riches of men already too wealthy. All he could do towards restoring\r\na sort of equilibrium between his receipts and disbursements was to lay\r\nan exorbitant tax on all the classes of his slaves. The poll-tax of the\r\nwretched serfs was doubled, and a new tax was imposed upon the nobles,\r\nwhich, however, the serfs would ultimately have to pay. After the first\r\nimpressions which his accession caused in the heart of Paul, punishments\r\nand disgraces succeeded with the same rapidity and profusion with which\r\nhe had lavished his favours. Several experienced the two extremes in a\r\nfew days. It is true that most of these punishments at first appeared\r\njust; but then it must be allowed that Paul could scarcely strike any but\r\nthe guilty, so corrupt had been all who were about the throne.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PAUL I\r\n\r\n(1754-1801)]\r\n\r\nA whim which caused no little surprise was the imperial prohibition of\r\nwearing round hats, or rather the sudden order to take them away or\r\ntear them to pieces on the heads of those who appeared in them. This\r\noccasioned some disgraceful scenes in the streets, and particularly\r\nnear the palace. The Cossacks and soldiers of the police fell on the\r\npassengers to uncover their heads, and beat those who, not knowing the\r\nreason, attempted to defend themselves. An English merchant, going\r\nthrough the street in a sledge, was thus stopped, and his hat snatched\r\noff. Supposing it to be a robbery, he leaped out of his sledge, knocked\r\ndown the soldier, and called the guard. Instead of the guard, arrived an\r\nofficer, who overpowered and bound him; but as they were carrying him\r\nbefore the police, he was fortunate enough to meet the coach of the\r\nEnglish minister, who was going to court, and claimed his protection. Sir\r\nCharles Whitworth made his complaint to the emperor; who, conjecturing\r\nthat a round hat might be the national dress of the English as it was\r\nof the Swedes, said that his order had been misconceived, and he would\r\nexplain himself more fully to Arkarov. The next day it was published\r\nin the streets and houses that strangers who were not in the emperor’s\r\nservice, or naturalised, were not comprised in the prohibition. Round\r\nhats were now no longer pulled off; but those who were met with this\r\nunlucky headdress were conducted to the police to ascertain their\r\ncountry. If they were found to be Russians, they were sent for soldiers;\r\nand woe to a Frenchman who had been met with in this dress, for he would\r\nhave been condemned as a Jacobin.\r\n\r\nA regulation equally incomprehensible was the sudden prohibition of\r\nharnessing horses after the Russian mode. A fortnight was allowed for\r\nprocuring harness in the German fashion; after the expiration of which,\r\nthe police were ordered to cut the traces of every carriage the horses of\r\nwhich were harnessed in the ancient manner. As soon as this regulation\r\nwas made public, several persons dared not venture abroad, still less\r\nappear in their carriages near the palace, for fear of being insulted.\r\nThe harness-markers availed themselves of the occasion to charge\r\nexorbitant prices. To dress the _ishvoshtshki_, or Russian coachmen, in\r\nthe German fashion, was attended with another inconvenience. Most of them\r\nwould neither part with their long beards, their kaftans, nor their round\r\nhats; still less would they tie a false tail to their short hair, which\r\nproduced the most ridiculous scenes and figures in the world. At length\r\nthe emperor had the vexation to be obliged to change his rigorous order\r\ninto a simple invitation to his subjects gradually to adopt the German\r\nfashion of dress, if they wished to merit his favour. Another reform with\r\nrespect to carriages: the great number of splendid equipages that swarmed\r\nin the streets of St. Petersburg disappeared in an instant. The officers,\r\neven the generals, came to the parade on foot, or in little sledges,\r\nwhich also was not without its dangers.\r\n\r\nIt was anciently a point of etiquette for every person who met a Russian\r\nautocrat, his wife, or son, to stop his horse or coach, alight, and\r\nprostrate himself in the snow or in the mud. This barbarous homage,\r\ndifficult to be paid in a large city where carriages pass in great\r\nnumbers, and always on the gallop, had been completely abolished under\r\nthe reign of the polished Catherine. One of the first cares of Paul was\r\nto re-establish it in all its rigour. A general officer, who passed on\r\nwithout his coachmen’s observing the emperor riding by on horseback,\r\nwas stopped, and immediately put under arrest. The same unpleasant\r\ncircumstance occurred to several others, so that nothing was so much\r\ndreaded, either on foot or in a carriage, as the meeting of the emperor.\r\n\r\nThe ceremony established within the palace became equally strict, and\r\nequally dreaded. Woe betide him who, when permitted to kiss the hand of\r\nPaul, did not make the floor resound by striking it with his knee as\r\nloud as a soldier with the butt-end of his firelock. It was requisite,\r\ntoo, that the salute of the lips on his hand should be heard, to\r\ncertify the reality of the kiss, as well as of the genuflection. Prince\r\nGeorge Galitzin, the chamberlain, was put under arrest on the spot by\r\nhis majesty himself, for having made the bow and kissed the hand too\r\nnegligently.\r\n\r\nIf this new reign was fatal to the army and to the poor gentry, it was\r\nstill more so to the unhappy peasantry. A report being spread that Paul\r\nwas about to restrict the power of masters over their slaves, and give\r\nthe peasants of the lords the same advantages as those of the crown, the\r\npeople of the capital were much pleased with the hopes of this change. At\r\nthis juncture an officer set off for his regiment, which lay at Orenberg.\r\nOn the road he was asked about the new emperor, and what new regulations\r\nhe was making. He related what he had seen, and what he had heard; among\r\nthe rest, mentioning the ukase which was soon to appear in favour of\r\nthe peasants. At this news, those of Tver and Novgorod indulged in some\r\ntumultuous actions, which were considered as symptoms of rebellion. Their\r\nmasters were violently enraged with them; and the cause that had led them\r\ninto error was discovered. Marshal Repnin was immediately despatched at\r\nthe head of some troops against the insurgents; and the officer who had\r\nunwittingly given rise to this false hope, by retailing the news of the\r\ncity on his road, was soon brought back in confinement. The senate of\r\nSt. Petersburg judged him deserving of death, and condemned him to be\r\nbroken, to undergo the punishment of the knout, and if he survived this,\r\nto labour in the mines. The emperor confirmed the sentence. This was\r\nthe first criminal trial that was laid before the public; and assuredly\r\nit justified but too well those remains of shame which had before kept\r\nsecret similar outrages.\r\n\r\nThe most prominent of Paul’s eccentricities was that mania which, from\r\nhis childhood, he displayed for the military dress and exercise. This\r\npassion in a prince no more indicates the general or the hero than a\r\ngirl’s fondness for dressing and undressing her doll foretokens that\r\nshe will be a good mother. Frederick the Great, the most accomplished\r\nsoldier of his time, is well known to have had from his boyhood the\r\nmost insuperable repugnance to all those minutiæ of a corporal to which\r\nhis father would have subjected him; this was even the first source of\r\nthat disagreement which ever subsisted between the father and the son.\r\nFrederick, however, became a hero; his father was never anything more\r\nthan a corporal. Peter III pushed his soldato-mania to a ridiculous\r\npoint, fancying he made Frederick his model. He loved soldiers and arms,\r\nas a man loves horses and dogs. He knew nothing but how to exercise a\r\nregiment, and never went abroad but in a captain’s uniform.\r\n\r\nPaul, in his mode of life when grand duke, and his conduct after his\r\naccession, so strongly resembled his father that, changing names and\r\ndates, the history of the one might be taken for that of the other.\r\nBoth were educated in a perfect ignorance of business, and resided at a\r\ndistance from court, where they were treated as prisoners of state rather\r\nthan heirs to the crown; and whenever they presented themselves appeared\r\nas aliens and strangers, having no concern with the royal family. The\r\naunt of the father (Elizabeth) acted precisely as did the mother of the\r\nson. The endeavours of each were directed to prolong the infancy of their\r\nheirs, and to perpetuate the feebleness of their minds. The young princes\r\nwere both distinguished by personal vivacity and mental insensibility, by\r\nan activity which, untrained and neglected, degenerated into turbulence;\r\nthe father was sunk in debauchery, the son lost in the most insignificant\r\ntrifles. An unconquerable aversion to study and reflection gave to both\r\nthat infatuated taste for military parade, which would probably have\r\ndisplayed itself less forcibly in Paul had he been a witness of the\r\nridicule they attached to Peter. The education of Paul, however, was much\r\nmore attended to than that of his father. He was surrounded in infancy by\r\npersons of merit, and his youth promised a capacity of no ordinary kind.\r\nIt must also be allowed that he was exempt from many of the vices which\r\ndisgraced Peter; temperance and regularity of manners were prominent\r\nfeatures of his character--features the more commendable, as before his\r\nmother and himself they were rarely to be found in a Russian autocrat.\r\nTo the same cause, education, and his knowledge of the language and\r\ncharacter of the nation, it was owing that he differed from his father in\r\nother valuable qualities.\r\n\r\nThe similarity which, in some instances, marked their conduct towards\r\ntheir wives, is still more striking; and in their amours, a singular\r\ncoincidence of taste is observable. Catherine and Marie were the most\r\nbeautiful women of the court, yet both failed to gain the affections\r\nof their husbands. Catherine had an ambitious soul, a cultivated mind,\r\nand the most amiable and polished manners. In a man, however, whose\r\nattachments were confined to soldiers, to the pleasures of the bottle,\r\nand the fumes of tobacco, she excited no other sentiment than disgust\r\nand aversion. He was smitten with an object less respectable, and less\r\ndifficult to please. The countess Vorontzov, fat, ugly in her person\r\nand vulgar in her manners, was more suitable to his depraved military\r\ntaste, and she became his mistress. In like manner, the regular beauty\r\nof Marie, the unalterable sweetness of her disposition, her unwearied\r\ncomplaisance, her docility as a wife, and her tenderness as a mother were\r\nnot sufficient to prevent Paul from attaching himself to Mademoiselle\r\nNelidov, whose disposition and qualities better accorded with his own,\r\nand afterwards to a young lady of the name of Lopukhin, who, it is\r\nbelieved, rejected his suit. To the honour of Paul it is related that he\r\nsubmitted to that mortifying repulse with the most chivalric patience and\r\ngenerosity. Nelidov was ugly and diminutive, but seemed desirous, by her\r\nwit and address, to compensate for the disadvantages of her person; for a\r\nwoman to be in love with Paul it was necessary she should resemble him.\r\n\r\nOn their accession to the throne, neither the father nor the son were\r\nfavourites with the court or the nation, yet both acquired immediate\r\npopularity and favour. The first steps of Paul appeared to be directed,\r\nbut improved, by those of Peter. The liberation of Kosciuszko and other\r\nprisoners brought to public recollection the recall of Biron, Munich,\r\nand Lestocq, with this difference--that Peter III did not disgrace these\r\nacts of clemency and justice by ridiculous violences, or by odious and\r\ngroundless persecutions. Both issued ukases extremely favourable to the\r\nnobility, but from motives essentially different, and little to the\r\nhonour of the son. The father granted to the Russian gentry those natural\r\nrights which every man ought to enjoy; while the son attempted the folly\r\nof creating a heraldic nobility in Russia, where that Gothic institution\r\nhad never been known. In the conduct which he observed towards the\r\nclergy, Paul, however, showed himself a superior politician. Instead\r\nof insulting the priests, and obliging them to shave their beards, he\r\nbestowed the orders of the empire on the bishops, to put them on a\r\nfooting with the nobility, and flattered the populace and the priesthood\r\nby founding churches, in obedience to pretended inspiration.\r\n\r\nIn his military operations, however, his policy appears to have abandoned\r\nhim, because here he gave the reins to his ruling passion. The quick and\r\ntotal change of discipline he introduced in his armies created him nearly\r\nas many enemies as there were officers and soldiers. In the distrust and\r\nsuspicions which incessantly haunted him, his inferiority to his father\r\nis also evident. One of the first acts of Peter III was to abolish the\r\npolitical inquisition established by Elizabeth; whereas Paul prosecuted\r\nno scheme with greater alacrity than that of establishing a system of\r\nspies, and devising means for the encouragement of informers. The blind\r\nconfidence of the father was his ruin, but it flowed from a humanity\r\nof disposition always worthy of respect. The distrust of the son did\r\nnot save him; it was the offspring of a timorous mind, which by its\r\nsuspicions was more apt to provoke than to elude treason.[k]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Paul’s Foreign Policy_\r\n\r\nIn regard to foreign matters Paul’s initial policy was one of peace. He\r\nput a stop to the levying of recruits after the manner adopted by his\r\nmother--that is, in the proportion of three men to every five hundred\r\nsouls--recalled his army from Persia, and left Georgia to take care of\r\nitself. He showed compassion for the Poles, recalled the prisoners from\r\nSiberia, transferred King Stanislaus from Grodno to St. Petersburg,\r\nvisited Kosciuszko at Schlüsselburg and released him in company with the\r\nother prisoners. He bade Kolitchev, envoy extraordinary at Berlin, inform\r\nthe king that he, Paul, wished neither conquest nor aggrandisement. He\r\ndictated to Ostermann a circular directed to the foreign powers, in\r\nwhich he declared that of all the countries of the world Russia alone\r\nhad been constantly engaged in war since 1756; that forty years of\r\nwarfare had reduced the population; that the emperor’s humanity would\r\nnot allow him to withhold from his beloved subjects the peace for which\r\nthey longed; that though on account of these considerations Russia could\r\ntake no active part in the struggle against France, the emperor would\r\n“nevertheless remain closely united with his allies, and would use every\r\nmeans to oppose the rise of the mad French Republic which threatened\r\nall Europe with upheaval by the destruction of its laws, privileges,\r\nproperty, religion, and customs.” He refused all armed assistance to\r\nAustria, which was alarmed at Napoleon’s victories in Italy, and recalled\r\nthe fleet that Catherine had adjoined to the English fleet for the\r\npurpose of blockading the coasts of France and Holland. He even received\r\novertures made by Caillard, the French envoy to Prussia, and caused him\r\nto be informed that the emperor “did not consider himself at war with\r\nthe French, that he had never done anything to harm them, but was rather\r\ndisposed to keep peace with them, and would induce his allies to hasten\r\nthe conclusion of war, to which end he offered the mediation of Russia.”\r\n\r\nIt was not long, however, before relations again became strained between\r\nFrance and Russia. By the Treaty of Campo Formio the Ionian Isles had\r\nbeen given to the French, who thus acquired a threatening position in\r\nthe East and increased power over the Divan. The Directory authorised\r\nDombrowski to organise Polish legions in Italy. Panin, at Berlin,\r\nintercepted a letter from the Directory to the French envoy, which\r\nspoke of a restoration of Poland under a prince of Brandenburg. Paul,\r\non his side, took into his pay the troops of the prince of Condé, and\r\nestablished ten thousand émigrés in Volhinia and Podolia. He offered an\r\nasylum to Louis XVIII after his flight from Brunswick, and installed\r\nhim in the ducal palace at Mitau with a pension of 200,000 rubles. The\r\nnews that a French expedition was being secretly organised at Toulon\r\nmade him fear for the security of the coasts of the Black Sea, which\r\nwere immediately put in a state of defence. The abduction of Zagurski,\r\nthe Russian consul at Corfu, the capture of Malta by Napoleon, the\r\narrival at St. Petersburg of the banished knights who offered Paul the\r\nprotectorate of their order and the title of grand master, the invasion\r\nof Helvetian territory by the Directory, the expulsion of the pope and\r\nthe proclamation of the Roman Republic--all were events that precipitated\r\nthe rupture.\r\n\r\nPaul concluded an alliance with Turkey which had been disturbed by\r\nan Egyptian invasion, also with England, Austria, and the kingdom of\r\nNaples. Thus, by the double aggression of Bonaparte against Malta and\r\nEgypt, Russia and Turkey were led, contrary to all traditions, to make\r\ncommon cause. Paul pledged himself to unite his fleet with the Turkish\r\nand English squadron, and to furnish one body of troops for a descent\r\non Holland, another for the conquest of the Ionian Isles, and a grand\r\nauxiliary army for the campaigns in Italy and Switzerland.\r\n\r\nIn the autumn of 1798 a Turkish-Russian fleet captured the French\r\ngarrisons in the Ionian Isles. The king of Naples invaded the territory\r\nof the Roman Republic, but Championnet brought the Neapolitan troops back\r\non to their own ground, and after making a triumphal entry into Naples\r\nproclaimed the Parthenopean Republic.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CAMPAIGNS OF KORSAKOV AND SUVAROV (1798-1799)\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [1798-1799 A.D.]]\r\n\r\nThe Russian army in Switzerland was placed under the command of\r\nRimski-Korsakov, that of Holland under the orders of Hermann; while\r\nAustria, at the suggestion of England, requested that the victor\r\nof Fokshani and of the Rimnik should receive the command of the\r\nAustro-Russian army. Flattered by this mark of deference, Paul I recalled\r\nSuvarov from exile in his village. “Suvarov has no need of laurels,”\r\nwrote the czar, “but the country has need of Suvarov.”[c]\r\n\r\nA few days after the battle of Magnano, Suvarov arrived on the Mincio\r\nwith the first division of his forces, twenty thousand strong, and took\r\nthe command of all the allied troops in Italy. The jealousy of the\r\nAustrian generals was naturally excited and they called a council of war,\r\nin order to examine his plans. The members of the council, beginning at\r\nthe youngest, proposed their several schemes. Suvarov quietly heard them\r\nall, and when they had done, took a slate, drew two lines, and said,\r\n“Here, gentleman, are the French, and here the Russians; the latter will\r\nmarch against the former and beat them.” So saying, he rubbed out the\r\nFrench line, and added, “This is all my plan; the council is concluded.”\r\n\r\nSuvarov kept his word, and in less than three months swept the French\r\nentirely out of Lombardy and Piedmont. Thrusting himself between the\r\nthree French armies of Switzerland, northern Italy, and the Parthenopean\r\nRepublic, it was his purpose, in concert with the archduke Charles of\r\nAustria, to penetrate into France on its most defenceless side, by the\r\nVosges and the Jura, the same quarter on which the great invasion of 1814\r\nwas afterwards effected. The campaign opened on the 25th of April, on the\r\nsteep banks of the Adda, behind which Moreau had posted his diminished\r\nforce of twenty-eight thousand men in three divisions. The passage was\r\nforced with immense loss to the French, who were compelled to abandon\r\nMilan, which Suvarov entered in triumph on the 29th.\r\n\r\nAfter a week’s delay, during which all the principal places of Lombardy\r\nsurrendered to the allies, Suvarov followed Moreau’s retreat, and\r\nendeavoured to dislodge him from his advantageous position on the Po. Not\r\nsucceeding in this attempt as rapidly as suited his impetuous habits, the\r\nRussian general suddenly changed his purpose, and advanced against Turin,\r\nwhilst Moreau at the same moment had resolved to retire to Turin and the\r\ncrests of the Apennines, in order to preserve his communications with\r\nFrance. On the 27th of May, Vukassovitch, who commanded the advance guard\r\nof the Russians, surprised Turin, and forced the French to take refuge\r\nin the citadel, leaving in the hands of the victors nearly three hundred\r\npieces of artillery, sixty thousand muskets, and an enormous quantity of\r\nammunition and military stores. Moreau’s army, thus deprived of all its\r\nresources, was saved from destruction only by the extraordinary ability\r\nof its commander, who led it safely towards Genoa by a mountain path,\r\nwhich was rendered practicable for artillery, in four days. With the\r\nexception of a few fortresses, nothing now remained to the French of all\r\nNapoleon’s conquests in northern Italy; they had been lost in less time\r\nthan it had taken to make them.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [1799 A.D.]]\r\n\r\nExulting in the brilliant success of his arms, Paul bestowed another\r\nsurname, Italienski, or the Italian, on his victorious general, and\r\nordered by an express ukase that Suvarov should be universally regarded\r\nas the greatest commander that had ever appeared. Meanwhile the results\r\nof his skill and vigour were neutralised by the selfish policy of the\r\nAustrian court, which had become by the Treaty of Campo Formio, and the\r\nacquisition of Venice, in some degree an actual accomplice with the\r\naggressors against whom it was in arms. Suvarov was compelled to submit\r\nto the dictation of the emperor Francis I, and deeply disgusted he\r\ndeclared that he was no longer of any use in Italy, and that he desired\r\nnothing so ardently as to be recalled.\r\n\r\nThe disasters of the French in upper Italy were fatal to their ascendancy\r\nin the south, and Macdonald received orders to abandon the Parthenopean\r\nRepublic, and unite his forces with those of Moreau. His retreat was\r\nexposed to great dangers by the universal insurrection of the peasants;\r\nbut he accomplished it with great rapidity and skill. The two French\r\ncommanders then concerted measures to dislodge the allies from their\r\nconquests--a project which seemed not unlikely to be fulfilled, so\r\nobstinately had the Aulic council adhered to the old system of dispersing\r\nthe troops all over the territory which they occupied. Though the\r\nallies had above a hundred thousand men in the field, they could hardly\r\nassemble thirty thousand at any one point; and Macdonald might easily\r\nhave destroyed them in detail could he have fallen upon them at once;\r\nbut the time he spent in reorganising his army in Tuscany, and in\r\nconcerting measures with Moreau, was well employed by Suvarov in promptly\r\nconcentrating his forces. Macdonald advanced against him with an army\r\nof thirty-seven thousand men, taking Modena on his way, and driving\r\nHohenzollern out of it after a bloody engagement. The two armies met on\r\nthe Trebbia, where a first and indecisive action took place on the 17th\r\nof June; it was renewed on each of the two following days, and victory\r\nfinally remained with the Russians. In this terrible battle of three\r\ndays, the most obstinately contested and bloody that had occurred since\r\nthe beginning of the war, the loss on both sides was excessive; that of\r\nthe French was above twelve thousand in killed and wounded, and that of\r\nthe allies not much less. But nearly equal losses told with very unequal\r\nseverity on the respective combatants; those of the allies would speedily\r\nbe retrieved by large reinforcements, but the republicans had expended\r\ntheir last resources, were cut off from Moreau, and had no second army to\r\nfall back upon. Macdonald with infinite difficulty regained the positions\r\nhe had occupied before the advance to the Trebbia, after losing an\r\nimmense number of prisoners.\r\n\r\nThe fall of the citadel of Turin on the 20th of June was of great\r\nimportance to the allies; for besides disengaging their besieging force\r\nit put into their hands one of the strongest fortresses in Piedmont,\r\nand an immense quantity of artillery and ammunition. This event, and\r\nSuvarov’s victory on the Trebbia, checked the successful operations of\r\nMoreau, and compelled him to fall back to his former defensive position\r\non the Apennines. Again, contrary to Suvarov’s wishes, the allied forces\r\nwere divided for the purpose of reducing Mantua and Alexandria, and\r\noccupying Tuscany. After the fall of those two fortresses, Suvarov laid\r\nsiege to Tortona, when Joubert, who had meanwhile superseded Moreau,\r\nmarched against him at the head of the combined forces of the French. On\r\nthe 15th of August, another desperate battle was fought at Novi, in which\r\nJoubert was killed, but from which neither side derived any particular\r\nadvantage. The French returned to their former positions, and the Italian\r\ncampaign was ended.\r\n\r\nSuvarov now received orders to join his forces with those under Korsakov,\r\nwho was on the Upper Rhine with thirty thousand men. The archduke Charles\r\nmight, even without this fresh reinforcement, have already annihilated\r\nMassena had he not remained for three months, from June to August, in\r\ncomplete inactivity; at the very moment of Suvarov’s expected arrival,\r\nhe allowed the important passes of the St. Gotthard to be again carried\r\nby a coup-de-main by the French, under General Lecourbe, who drove the\r\nAustrians from the Simplon, the Furka, the Grimsel, and the Devil’s\r\nBridge. The archduke, after an unsuccessful attempt to push across the\r\nAar at Dettingen, suddenly quitted the scene of war and advanced down\r\nthe Rhine for the purpose of supporting the English expedition under the\r\nduke of York against Holland. This unexpected turn in affairs proceeded\r\nfrom Vienna. The Viennese cabinet was jealous of Russia. Suvarov played\r\nthe master in Italy, favoured Sardinia at the expense of the house of\r\nHabsburg, and deprived the Austrians of the laurels and the advantages\r\nthey had won. The archduke, accordingly, received orders to remain\r\ninactive, to abandon the Russians, and finally to withdraw to the\r\nnorth; by this movement Suvarov’s triumphant progress was checked, he\r\nwas compelled to cross the Alps to the aid of Korsakov, and to involve\r\nhimself in a mountain warfare ill-suited to the habits of his soldiery.\r\n\r\nKorsakov, whom Bavaria had been bribed with Russian gold to furnish with\r\na corps one thousand strong, was supported solely by Kray and Hotze with\r\ntwenty thousand men. Massena, taking advantage of the departure of the\r\narchduke and the non-arrival of Suvarov, crossed the Limmat at Dietikon\r\nand shut Korsakov, who had imprudently stationed himself with his whole\r\narmy in Zurich, so closely in that, after an engagement that lasted two\r\ndays, from the 15th to the 17th of September, the Russian general was\r\ncompelled to abandon his artillery and to force his way through the\r\nenemy. Ten thousand men were all that escaped. Hotze, who had advanced\r\nfrom the Grisons to Schwyz to Suvarov’s rencontre, was, at the same time,\r\ndefeated and killed at Schanis. Suvarov, although aware that the road\r\nacross the St. Gotthard was blocked by the Lake of Lucerne, on which\r\nthere were no boats, had the temerity to attempt the passage. In Airolo,\r\nhe was obstinately opposed by the French under Lecourbe, and, although\r\nShveikovski contrived to turn this strong position by scaling the\r\npathless rocks, numbers of the men were, owing to Suvarov’s impatience,\r\nsacrificed before it.\r\n\r\nOn the 24th of September, 1799, he at length climbed the St. Gotthard,\r\nand a bloody engagement, in which the French were worsted, took place\r\non the Oberalpsee. Lecourbe blew up the Devil’s Bridge, but, leaving\r\nthe Urnerloch open, the Russians pushed through that rocky gorge, and,\r\ndashing through the foaming Reuss, scaled the opposite rocks and drove\r\nthe French from their position behind the Devil’s Bridge. Altorf on the\r\nlake was reached in safety by the Russian general, who was compelled,\r\nowing to the want of boats, to seek his way through the valleys of\r\nSchächen and Muotta, across the almost impassable rocks, to Schwyz. The\r\nheavy rains rendered the undertaking still more arduous; the Russians,\r\nowing to the badness of the road, were speedily barefoot; the provisions\r\nwere also exhausted. In this wretched state they reached Muotta on the\r\n29th of September and learned the discouraging news of Korsakov’s defeat.\r\nMassena had already set off in the hope of cutting off Suvarov, but had\r\nmissed his way. He reached Altorr, where he joined Lecourbe on the 29th,\r\nwhen Suvarov was already at Muotta, whence Massena found on his arrival\r\nthat he had again retired across the Bragelburg, through the Klönthal. He\r\nwas opposed on the lake of Klönthal by Molitor, who was, however, forced\r\nto retire by Auffenberg, who had joined Suvarov at Altorf and formed his\r\nadvanced guard, Rosen, at the same time, beating off Massena with the\r\nrearguard, taking five cannon and one thousand of his men prisoners. On\r\nthe 1st of October, Suvarov entered Glarus, where he rested until the\r\n4th, when he crossed the Panixer Mountains through snow two feet deep\r\nto the valley of the Rhine, which he reached on the 10th, after losing\r\nthe whole of his beasts of burden and two hundred of his men down the\r\nprecipices; and here ended his extraordinary march, which had cost him\r\nthe whole of his artillery, almost all his horses, and a third of his men.\r\n\r\nThe archduke had, meanwhile, tarried on the Rhine, where he had taken\r\nPhilippsburg and Mannheim, but had been unable to prevent the defeat of\r\nthe English expedition under the duke of York by General Brune at Bergen,\r\non the 19th of September. The archduke now, for the first time, made a\r\nretrograde movement, and approached Korsakov and Suvarov. The different\r\nleaders, however, did nothing but find fault with each other, and the\r\nczar, perceiving his project frustrated, suddenly recalled his troops,\r\nand the campaign came to a close.\r\n\r\nPaul’s anger fell without measure or reason on his armies and their\r\nchiefs. All the officers who were missing, that is to say who were\r\nprisoners in France, were broken as deserters, and Suvarov, instead\r\nof being well received with well merited honours, was deprived of\r\nhis command and not suffered to see the emperor’s face. This unjust\r\nseverity broke the veteran’s heart. He died soon after his return to St.\r\nPetersburg; and no Russian courtier, nor any member of the diplomatic\r\nbody except the English ambassador, followed his remains to the grave.\r\n\r\n\r\nPAUL RECONCILED WITH FRANCE (1800 A.D.)\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [1800 A.D.]]\r\n\r\nFrustrated in the objects for which he had engaged in war, Paul was now\r\nin a mood easily to be moved to turn his arms against the allies who had\r\ndeceived his hopes. He had fought for the re-establishment of monarchy in\r\nFrance, and of the old _status quo_ in Europe; and the only result had\r\nbeen the aggrandisement of Austria, his own immediate neighbour, of whom\r\nhe had much more reason to be jealous than of the remote power of France.\r\nThe rapid steps, too, which Bonaparte was taking for the restoration\r\nof monarchical forms in that country were especially calculated to\r\nconciliate Paul’s good-will towards the first consul. The latter and his\r\nable ministers promptly availed themselves of this favourable disposition\r\nthrough the connections they had made in St. Petersburg. Fouché had such\r\nconfidential correspondence even with ladies in the Russian capital, that\r\nhe afterwards received the earliest and most correct intelligence of the\r\nemperor’s murder. Two persons at the court of St. Petersburg were next\r\ngained over to France, or rather to Bonaparte’s rising empire; these were\r\nthe minister Rostoptchin, and the emperor’s favourite, the Turk Kutaisov,\r\nwho had risen with unusual rapidity from the situation of the emperor’s\r\nbarber to the rank of one of the first Russian nobles. He was also nearly\r\nconnected by relationship with Rostoptchin.\r\n\r\nRostoptchin first found means to send away General Dumourier from St.\r\nPetersburg, whither he had come for the purpose of carrying on his\r\nintrigues in favour of the Bourbons. He next sought to bring Louis\r\nCobenzl also into discredit with the emperor, and he succeeded in this,\r\nshortly before the opening of the campaign in Italy in 1800, when the\r\ncabinet of Vienna was called upon to give a plain and direct answer to\r\nthe questions peremptorily put by the emperor of Russia. Paul required\r\nthat the cabinet should answer, without if or but, without circumlocution\r\nor reserve, whether or not Austria would, according to the terms of the\r\ntreaty, restore the pope and the king to their dominions and sovereignty.\r\nCobenzl was obliged to reply that if Austria were to give back Piedmont\r\nto the king of Sardinia it must still retain Tortona and Alessandria; and\r\nthat it never would restore the three legations and Ancona. The measure\r\nof the emperor’s indignation was now full; he forbade Count Cobenzl the\r\ncourt, and at a later period not only ordered him to leave the country,\r\nbut would not even allow an embassy or chargé-d’affaires to remain.\r\n\r\nThe emperor proceeded more deliberately with regard to the English. At\r\nfirst he acted as if he had no desire to break with them; and he even\r\nallowed the Russians, whom they had hired for the expedition against\r\nHolland, to remain in Guernsey under Viomesnil’s command, in order to\r\nassist their employers in an expedition against Brittany. The English\r\ngovernment, however, at length provoked him to extremities. They refused\r\nto redeem the Russians who had been made prisoners in their service,\r\nby giving in exchange for them an equal number of French, of whom\r\ntheir prisons were full; they refused to listen to any arrangements\r\nrespecting the grand mastership of the knights of Malta, or even as to\r\nthe protectorate of the order, and gave the clearest intimations that\r\nthey meant to keep the island for themselves. Bonaparte seized upon this\r\nfavourable moment for flattering the emperor, by acting as if he had\r\nreally more respect for Paul than the two powers for whom he had made\r\nsuch magnanimous sacrifices. Whilst the English refused to redeem the\r\nRussians made prisoners in their service by exchange, Bonaparte set them\r\nfree without either exchange or ransom.\r\n\r\nThe emperor of Germany had broken his word, and neither restored the pope\r\nnor the king of Sardinia, whilst Bonaparte voluntarily offered to restore\r\nthe one and give compensation to the other. He assailed the emperor in\r\na masterly manner on his weak side, causing the six or seven thousand\r\nRussians, whom the English refused to exchange, to be provided with new\r\nclothing and arms, and he wrote a letter to Panin, the Russian minister,\r\nin which he said that he was unwilling to suffer such brave soldiers\r\nas these Russians were to remain longer away from their native land on\r\naccount of the English. In the same letter he paid another compliment\r\nto the emperor, and threw an apple of mortal strife between him and\r\nEngland. Knowing as he did that his garrison in Malta could not hold out\r\nmuch longer, he offered to place the island in the hands of the emperor\r\nPaul, as a third party. This was precisely what the emperor desired; and\r\nSprengporten, who was sent to France to bring away the Russians, and to\r\nthank the first consul, was to occupy Malta with them. The Russians were\r\neither to be conveyed thither by Nelson, who up to this time had kept the\r\nisland closely blockaded, and was daily expecting its surrender, or at\r\nleast he was to be ordered to let them pass; but both he and the English\r\nhaughtily rejected the Russian mediation.\r\n\r\nPaul now came to a complete breach with England. First of all he recalled\r\nhis Russian troops from Guernsey, but on this occasion he was again\r\nbaffled. It was of great importance to the English cabinet that Bonaparte\r\nshould not immediately hear of the decided breach which had taken\r\nplace between them and the emperor, and they therefore prevailed upon\r\nViomesnil, an émigré, who had the command of the Russians in Guernsey,\r\nto remain some weeks longer, in opposition to the emperor’s will. Paul\r\nwas vehemently indignant at this conduct; Viomesnil, however, entered\r\nthe English service, and was provided for by the English government in\r\nPortugal.\r\n\r\nLord Whitworth was next obliged to leave Russia, as Count Cobenzl\r\nhad previously been. Paul recalled his ambassadors from the courts\r\nof Vienna and London, and forthwith sent Count Kalitchev to Paris to\r\nenter into friendly negotiations with Bonaparte. In the meantime, the\r\nEnglish had recourse to some new subterfuges, and promised, that in\r\ncase Malta capitulated, they would consent to allow the island to be\r\nadministered, till the conclusion of a peace, by commissioners appointed\r\nby Russia, England, and Naples. Paul had already named Bailli de la\r\nFerrette for this purpose; but the English refused to acknowledge his\r\nnominee, and even to receive the Neapolitans in Malta. Before this took\r\nplace, however, the emperor had come to issue with England on a totally\r\ndifferent question.\r\n\r\nThe idea of a union among the neutral powers, in opposition to the right\r\nalleged by England, when at war with any power whatsoever, to subject\r\nthe ships of all neutral powers to search, had been relinquished by\r\nthe empress Catherine in 1781, to please the English ambassador at her\r\ncourt; Paul now resumed the idea. Bonaparte intimated his concurrence,\r\nand Paul followed up the matter with great energy and zeal, as in this\r\nway he had an opportunity of exhibiting himself in the character of an\r\nimperial protector of the weak, a defender of justice and right, and as\r\nthe head of a general alliance of the European powers. Prussia also now\r\nappeared to do homage to him, for the weak king was made to believe,\r\nthat by a close alliance between Russia and France, he might be helped\r\nto an extension of territory and an increase of subjects, without danger\r\nor cost to himself, or without war, which he abhorred beyond everything\r\nelse. The first foundation, therefore, for an alliance between Russia and\r\nFrance, was laid in Berlin, where Beurnonville, the French ambassador,\r\nwas commissioned to enter into negotiations with the Russian minister Von\r\nKrüderer. Beurnonville promised, in Bonaparte’s name, that the Russian\r\nmediation in favour of Naples and Sardinia would be accepted, and that,\r\nin the question of compensations for the German princes particular regard\r\nwould be had to the cases of Baden and Würtemberg.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ARMED NEUTRALITY (1800 A.D.)\r\n\r\nAs to the armed neutrality by sea against England, Prussia could easily\r\nconsent to join this alliance, because she had in fact no navy; but it\r\nwas much more difficult for Sweden and Denmark, whose merchant ships were\r\nalways accompanied by frigates. In case, therefore, the neutral powers\r\ncame to an understanding that no merchant vessels which were accompanied\r\nby a ship of war should be compelled to submit to a search, this might\r\nat any time involve them in hostilities with England. In addition to\r\nDenmark, Sweden, and Prussia, which, under Paul’s protectorate, were to\r\nconclude an alliance for the protection of trading vessels belonging\r\nto neutral powers against the arrogant claims of England, Bonaparte\r\nendeavoured to prevail upon the North Americans to join the alliance.\r\nThey were the only parties who, by a specific treaty in 1794, had\r\nacknowledged as a positive right what the others only submitted to as\r\nan unfounded pretension on the part of England. On that occasion the\r\nAmericans had broken with the French Republic on the subject of his\r\ntreaty, and Barras and Talleyrand had been shameless enough to propose\r\nthat the Americans should pay a gratuity, in order to effect a renewal of\r\ntheir old friendship with France, which proposal, however, the Americans\r\ntreated with contempt.\r\n\r\nOn the 30th of September, 1800, their ambassadors concluded an agreement\r\nat Bonaparte’s country seat of Morfontaine, which referred especially to\r\nthe resistance which all the neutral powers under the protectorate of the\r\nemperor of Russia were desirous of making to the pretensions and claims\r\nof England. The Americans first of all declared that neutral flags should\r\nmake a neutral cargo, except in cases where the ship was actually laden\r\nwith goods contraband of war. It was afterwards precisely defined what\r\nwere to be considered goods contraband of war. By the fourth article it\r\nwas determined that neutral ships must submit to be detained, but that\r\nthe ships of war so detaining a merchantman with a view to search should\r\nremain at least at the distance of a cannon-shot, and only be allowed\r\nto send a boat with three men to examine the ship’s papers and cargo;\r\nand that in all cases in which a merchantman should be under convoy of a\r\nship of war, no right of search should exist, because the presence of the\r\nconvoy should be regarded as a sufficient guarantee against contraband.\r\nInasmuch as England and Denmark were at open issue concerning this last\r\npoint, the Americans would have been inevitably involved in the dispute\r\nhad they immediately ratified the treaty of Morfontaine: they were,\r\nhowever, far too cunning to fall into this difficulty; and they did not\r\ntherefore ratify the treaty till the Russian confederation had been\r\ndissolved.\r\n\r\nSweden and Denmark had come to issue with England concerning the right of\r\nsearch in 1798 and 1799, when four frigates, two Swedish and two Danish,\r\nwere captured and brought into English ports. True, they were afterwards\r\ngiven up, but without any satisfaction, for the English still insisted\r\nupon the right of search. The dispute became most vehement in the case of\r\nthe Danish frigate _Freya_, which, together with the merchantmen under\r\nher convoy, were brought into an English port, after a sharp engagement\r\non the 25th of July, 1800; and the English, aware of the hostile\r\nnegotiations which were going on in the north, at once despatched an\r\nexpedition against Denmark.\r\n\r\nSixteen English ships of war suddenly appeared before Copenhagen, and\r\nmost unexpectedly threatened the harbour and city with a destructive\r\nbombardment, if Denmark did not at once acknowledge England’s right of\r\nsearch at sea. Had this acknowledgment been made, Bonaparte’s and the\r\nemperor’s plan would have been frustrated in its very origin; but Denmark\r\nhad the good fortune to possess, in its minister Bernstorff, the greatest\r\ndiplomatist of the whole revolutionary era, who contrived for that time\r\nto save Copenhagen without the surrender of any rights. It was quite\r\nimpossible to resist by force, but he refused to enter upon the question\r\nof right or wrong; and in the agreement which he signed with Lord\r\nWhitworth on the 25th of August, 1800, he consented that in the meantime\r\nall occasion for dispute should be avoided, and thus the difficulty\r\nbe postponed or removed. Denmark bound herself no longer to send her\r\nmerchantmen under convoy--whereupon the _Freya_, and the vessels by which\r\nshe was accompanied, were set at liberty. On this occasion the emperor\r\nPaul offered himself as arbitrator; and when Lord Whitworth rejected his\r\ninterference or arbitration, he immediately laid an embargo on all the\r\nEnglish ships in Russian ports.\r\n\r\nThe news of the agreement entered into at Copenhagen, however, no sooner\r\nreached St. Petersburg, than this first embargo was removed, and the\r\ndispute carried on merely in a diplomatic manner. At last the emperor\r\nPaul put an end to this paper war, when Vaubois, who had defended\r\nMalta since July, 1798, against the English, Russians, Neapolitans,\r\nand sometimes also the Portuguese, at length capitulated, on the 5th\r\nof September, 1800. The island was taken military possession of by the\r\nEnglish without any reference whatever to the order, to Naples, to the\r\npromise which they had made to the emperor, or to Bailli de la Ferrette,\r\nwhom Paul had named as the representative of the order. As soon as this\r\nnews reached St. Petersburg, Paul’s rage and indignation knew no bounds.\r\nOn the 7th of November, he not only laid an embargo upon three hundred\r\nEnglish ships then in his ports, but sent the whole of their crews into\r\nthe interior of Russia, and allowed them only a few kopecks a day for\r\ntheir support.\r\n\r\nLord Carysfort, the English ambassador in Berlin, was unable for six\r\nweeks to obtain any answer from the Prussian government with respect to\r\nits connection with the northern confederation, although he insisted\r\nstrongly upon it; and yet Stedingk, the Swedish minister, and Rosenkranz,\r\nthe Danish minister, had signed the agreement for an armed neutrality\r\nin the form of that of 1780 as early as the 17th of December, 1800, in\r\nSt. Petersburg, and the Prussian minister, Von Luft, in the name of his\r\nking, had signified his acceptance of the alliance on the 18th. When\r\nLord Carysfort at length obtained an answer on the 12th of February to\r\nhis demands, so long and repeatedly urged in vain, Haugwitz had drawn it\r\nup equivocally both in form and contents. The emperor of Russia was so\r\nindignant at the ambiguity that he not only expressed his feelings on the\r\nsubject warmly, but also took some hostile measures against Prussia.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the emperor invited Gustavus IV to St. Petersburg\r\nwhere he was received with the greatest splendour. He arrived at St.\r\nPetersburg at Christmas, 1800, and immediately, as if to insult the\r\nEnglish, a grand meeting of the order of Malta was held; the king himself\r\nwas loaded with marks of honour of every possible description, and at\r\nthe end of December he signed a new agreement, by which the objects\r\nof that of the 16th of the same month were greatly enlarged. In the\r\nformer alliance defensive operations alone were contemplated; but now\r\noffensive measures were also agreed upon, with the reservation, indeed,\r\nif they should become necessary. Paul took measures to refit his fleet,\r\nand an army was equipped which was to be placed under the commands of\r\nSoltikov, Pahlen, and Kutusov; the Danish fleet was in good condition;\r\nthe Russian minister in Paris appeared to regard the circumstances as\r\nvery favourable for gaining Hanover to his master without danger or risk;\r\nand Pitt himself considered the state of affairs so unfavourable, that\r\nhe seriously contemplated the propriety of retiring and making way for a\r\nnew ministry, in order to render a peace possible. This close confederacy\r\nagainst England was, however, dissolved at the very moment in which the\r\nfirst consul appeared to be disposed to favour Naples and Sardinia, in\r\norder to gratify the wishes of the emperor of Russia.\r\n\r\n\r\nASSASSINATION OF PAUL (1801 A.D.)\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [1801 A.D.]]\r\n\r\nThe catastrophe in St. Petersburg is easily explained by the continually\r\nchanging humours of the emperor, by his mental derangement, which had\r\nbeen constantly on the increase for several months previous to his\r\nmurder, by the acts of violence and injustice which he suffered himself\r\nto commit, and by the dreadful apprehension which prevailed among all\r\nclasses of society, from the empress and the grand duke down to the\r\nvery lowest citizen. The emperor’s sober and rational intervals became\r\nprogressively rarer, so that no man was sure for an instant either of his\r\nplace or his life; thousands of persons completely innocent were sent to\r\nSiberia, and yet goodness and mildness alternated with cruel severity.\r\nThe emperor one while exhibited the most striking magnanimity, at another\r\nthe meanest vindictiveness.\r\n\r\nThe beautiful and virtuous empress had patiently submitted to her\r\nhusband’s preference for the plain Nelidov, who at least treated her\r\nwith honour and respect; but she was obliged also to submit to his\r\nattachment to Lopukhin, who continually provoked strife. She endured\r\nthese things patiently, lived on good terms with the emperor, slept\r\nimmediately under his chambers, and yet neither she nor her sons,\r\nAlexander and Constantine, were able to escape the suspicions of his\r\nmorbid mind. It was whispered, by persons in the confidence of the court,\r\nthat the emperor had said he would send the empress to Kalamagan, in\r\nthe government of Astrakhan, Alexander to Shlüsselburg, and Constantine\r\nto the citadel of St. Petersburg. It is not worth while to inquire what\r\ntruth there may have been in these reports; everyone felt that the time\r\nhad arrived to have recourse to the only means which can be employed\r\nin despotic kingdoms for effecting a complete change in the measures\r\nof government. This means is the murder of the despot, which in such\r\ncircumstances was usually effected in the Roman Empire by the Pretorians,\r\nin Constantinople by the Janizaries, or by a clamorous and infuriated\r\nmob, in St. Petersburg by a number of confederated nobles; and in all\r\nthese cases was regarded as a sort of necessary appendage to the existing\r\nconstitution.\r\n\r\nRostoptchin, the minister, who had long possessed the emperor’s\r\nconfidence, was dismissed and in disgrace; and Count Pahlen, who was at\r\nthe head of the emperor’s dreadful police, was suddenly and excessively\r\nfavoured. He, too, observed, when he had reached the highest pinnacle,\r\nthat he began to be suspected. The count was an Esthonian by birth, a man\r\nof a cold, deep, and faithless disposition, and the instrument of all the\r\ncruelties and severities which had been exercised by the emperor. He was\r\nalso commander-in-chief of all the troops in the capital, and since the\r\n10th of March had become a member of the ministry for foreign affairs.\r\nUp to this period he had been successful in discovering and frustrating\r\nall the real or pretended attempts at dethroning the emperor, but he now\r\nformed a conspiracy against him, because he knew that Paul had called to\r\nhis aid two formidable assistants, to use them against himself in case\r\nof necessity. The emperor had previously sent away from St. Petersburg\r\nand now recalled Lindner and Araktcheiev, two of his most dreadful\r\ninstruments of violence, the latter of whom played a fearful part in\r\nRussia even during the reign of the mild and clement emperor Alexander.\r\nPahlen had previously taken his measures in such a manner that a number\r\nof those to whom the murder of an emperor was no novelty were at that\r\ntime collected in St. Petersburg, and only waited for a hint, either with\r\nor without Pahlen, to fall upon the emperor, who had personally given\r\nthem mortal offence.\r\n\r\nValerian, Nicholas, and Plato Zubov had first been publicly affronted\r\nby the emperor like the Orlovs, and afterwards dismissed; they remained\r\nunder compulsory absence in Germany till they found a medium for\r\nsecuring the favour of the only person who had any influence over the\r\nemperor. This medium was the French actress, Chevalier, who ruled the\r\nTurk Kutaisov (formerly a _valet de chambre_, but now adorned with all\r\npossible titles, honours, and orders, with the broad ribbon and stars of\r\nEurope), and through him ruled the emperor. Chevalier obtained permission\r\nfor the Zubovs to return to the court, and Plato held Kutaisov bound\r\nby his expressed intention of marrying the Turk’s daughter. Plato had\r\nbeen previously commander-in-chief of the army, and could, in case of\r\nneed, reckon upon it with the greater certainty, as it had been made\r\ndiscontented by the gross and ridiculous treatment of the generals of the\r\nwhole army, and even of such a man as Suvarov.\r\n\r\nParticipators in a plan for setting aside the emperor were easily found\r\namong the nobles, as soon as it became certain that there was nothing\r\nto fear. It was necessary, however, to obtain the consent of the two\r\neldest grand dukes; but not a word was said of the murder, but merely\r\nof the removal of their father from the government. Alexander was not\r\neasily prevailed upon to acquiesce in the deposition of his father, as,\r\nhowever numerous Alexander’s failings in other respects may have been,\r\nboth he and his mother were persons of gentle hearts. Pahlen undertook\r\nthe business of persuading the prince, for which he was by far the best\r\nfitted, inasmuch as he knew all the secrets of the court, and combined\r\nall power in himself; he therefore succeeded in convincing the imperial\r\nfamily of the dangers with which they themselves were threatened, and of\r\nthe necessity of deposing the emperor. He appears to have prevailed with\r\nAlexander by showing that he could only guard against a greater evil by\r\nconsenting to his father’s dethronement. Certain it is at least, that\r\nAlexander signed the proclamation, announcing his own assumption of the\r\nreins of government, two hours before the execution of the deed by the\r\nconspirators.\r\n\r\nThe emperor with his family lived in the Mikhailov palace; the 23rd of\r\nMarch, 1801, was chosen for the accomplishment of the deed, for on that\r\nday the Semenovski battalion of guards was on duty at the palace. The\r\nmost distinguished men among the conspirators were the Zubov, General\r\nCount Benningsen, a Hanoverian, who had distinguished himself in the\r\nPolish wars under Catherine, Tchitchakov, Tartarinov, Tolstoi, Iashvel,\r\nIesselovitch, and Uvarov, together with Count Pahlen himself, who did not\r\naccompany the others into the emperor’s bedchamber, but had taken his\r\nmeasures so skilfully that, if the enterprise failed, he might appear\r\nas his deliverer. Very shortly before the execution of the deed, Pahlen\r\ncommunicated the design to General Talitzin, colonel of the regiment of\r\nPreobrajenski guards, to General Deporadevitch, colonel of the Semonovski\r\nguards, together with some fifty other officers whom he entertained on\r\nthe night on which the murder was committed.\r\n\r\nOn the evening before his death Paul received, when sitting at supper\r\nwith his mistress, a note from Prince Mechereki, warning him of his\r\ndanger, and revealing the names of the conspirators. He handed it\r\nunopened to Kutaisov, saying he would read it on the morrow. Kutaisov put\r\nit in his pocket, and left it there when he changed his dress next day to\r\ndine with the emperor. He turned to get it, but Paul growing impatient\r\nsent for him in a hurry, and the trembling courtier came back without\r\nthe letter on which so much depended. On the night of the 3rd Paul went\r\nearly to bed; soon afterwards the conspirators repaired to his apartment,\r\nthe outer door of which was opened to them in compliance with the demand\r\nof Argamakov, an aide-de-camp, who pretended that he was come to make\r\nhis report to the emperor. A Cossack who guarded the door of the bedroom\r\noffered resistance and was cut down. The conspirators rushed in and found\r\nthe bed empty. “He has escaped us,” cried some of them. “That he has\r\nnot,” said Benningsen. “No weakness, or I will put you all to death.”\r\nPutting his hand on the bed-clothes and feeling them warm, he observed\r\nthat the emperor could not be far off, and presently he discovered him\r\ncrouching behind a screen. The conspirators required him to sign his\r\nabdication. He refused, a conflict ensued; a sash was passed round his\r\nneck, and he was strangled after a desperate resistance.\r\n\r\nAlexander was seized with the most passionate grief when he learned at\r\nwhat a price he had acquired the crown. He had supped with his father\r\nat nine o’clock, and at eleven he took possession of the empire, by\r\na document which had been drawn up and signed two hours and a half\r\npreviously. The most dreadful thing of all, however, was that he was\r\nobliged not only to suffer the two chief conspirators, Zubov and Pahlen,\r\nto remain about his person, but to allow them to share the administration\r\nof the empire between them. It was a piece of good fortune that those\r\ntwo thoroughly wicked men were of very different views, by which means\r\nhe was first enabled to remove Pahlen, and afterwards Zubov also. Their\r\nassociates, however, remained, and at a later period we shall find Count\r\nBenningsen at the head of the army which was to deliver Prussia after the\r\nbattle of Jena.\r\n\r\nPaul was twice married: by his first wife, Nathalie Alexeievna, princess\r\nof Hesse Darmstadt, who died in 1776, he had no family; by his second,\r\nMarie Feodorovna, princess of Würtemberg, who died in 1828, he had ten\r\nchildren, the eldest of whom, Alexander by name, now succeeded to the\r\nimperial throne.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ACCESSION OF ALEXANDER I (1801 A.D.); HIS EARLY REFORMS\r\n\r\nThe accession of Alexander was hailed with sincere and universal delight,\r\nnot only as an escape from the wretched and extravagant reign of Paul,\r\nbut as the opening fulfilment of the expectations which had long been\r\nanxiously fixed on his heir. The new monarch was twenty-five years of\r\nage, of majestic figure and noble countenance, though his features were\r\nnot perfectly regular. He possessed an acute mind, a generous heart, and\r\na most winning grace of manner. “Still,” says M. Thiers, “there might\r\nbe discerned in him traces of hereditary infirmity. His mind, lively,\r\nchangeable, and susceptible, was continually impressed with the most\r\ncontrary ideas. But this remarkable prince was not always led away by\r\nsuch momentary impulses; he united with his extensive and versatile\r\ncomprehension a profound secretiveness which baffled the closest\r\nobservation. He was well-meaning, and a dissembler at the same time.”\r\nNapoleon said of him at St. Helena, “The emperor of Russia possesses\r\nabilities, grace, and information; he is fascinating, but one cannot\r\ntrust him; he is a true Greek of the Lower Empire; he is, or pretends to\r\nbe, a metaphysician; his faults are those of his education, or of his\r\npreceptor. What discussions have I not had with him! He maintained that\r\nhereditary right was an abuse, and I had to expend all my eloquence and\r\nlogic during a full hour to prove that hereditary right maintains the\r\nrepose and happiness of nations. Perhaps he wished to mystify me; for he\r\nis cunning, false, and skilful.”\r\n\r\nIn the beginning of Alexander’s reign reform succeeded reform, and all\r\nEurope applauded. He quickly put a stop to the system of terror and\r\nto the absurd vexations which Paul had introduced. He disgraced the\r\ninstruments who had worked out the will of that poor maniac; he repaired\r\nthe crying injustice which had been committed; he once more abolished\r\nthe terrible secret inquisition, but, as we already said, it was again\r\nestablished by his successor. He instituted a permanent council, and\r\ncontemplated the complete reorganisation of the administration of the\r\ninterior. He relaxed the rigour of the censorship of the press, and\r\ngranted permission to introduce foreign works. He reduced the taxes and\r\nthe expenditure of the court; and in the first year of his reign he\r\nabstained from exacting the recruits for his army, an exaction odious\r\nto those whom it affects, and therefore often accompanied with fearful\r\nviolences.\r\n\r\nHe applied himself most diligently to affairs, and laboured almost as\r\nmuch as his grandmother, who had devoted three hours to the concerns\r\nof the state when her ministers came to confer with her. He required\r\ndetailed reports from all the higher officers of state; and having\r\nexamined them, caused them to be published, a thing never before heard of\r\nin Russia. He abolished punishment by torture; forbade the confiscation\r\nof hereditary property; solemnly declared that he would not endure the\r\nhabit of making grants of peasants, a practice till then common with\r\nthe autocrats, and forbade the announcement in public journals of sales\r\nof human beings. He applied himself to the reform of the tribunals;\r\nestablished pecuniary fines for magistrates convicted of evading or\r\nviolating their duties; constituted the senate a high court of justice,\r\nand divided it into seven departments in order to provide against the\r\nslowness of law proceedings; and re-established the commission which had\r\nbeen appointed by Catherine for the compilation of a code. He applied\r\nhimself to the protection of commerce; made regulations for the benefit\r\nof navigation, and extended and improved the communication in the\r\ninterior of his empire. He did much to promote general education, and\r\nestablished several new universities with large numbers of subsidiary\r\nschools. He permitted every subject of his empire to choose his own\r\navocation in life, regardless of restraints formerly imposed with respect\r\nto rank, and removed the prohibition on foreign travel which had been\r\nenacted in the last reign. He permitted his nobles to sell to their\r\nserfs, along with their personal freedom, portions of land which should\r\nthus become the _bona fide_ property of the serf purchaser--a measure by\r\nwhich he fondly hoped to lay the basis of a class of free cultivators. It\r\nwas under his auspices that his mother, Marie Feodorovna, founded many\r\nhospitals and educational institutes, both for nobles and burghers, which\r\nwill immortalise her name.\r\n\r\nOne of the first acts of Alexander’s reign was to give orders that\r\nthe British sailors who had been taken from the ships laid under\r\nsequestration, and marched into the interior, should be set at liberty\r\nand carefully conducted at the public expense to the ports from which\r\nthey had been severally taken. At the same time all prohibitions against\r\nthe export of corn were removed--a measure of no small importance to\r\nthe famishing population of the British Isles, and hardly less material\r\nto the gorged proprietors of Russian produce. The young emperor shortly\r\nafter wrote a letter with his own hand to the king of England, expressing\r\nin the warmest terms his desire to re-establish the amicable relations\r\nof the two empires; a declaration which was received with no less joy\r\nin London than in St. Petersburg. The British cabinet immediately sent\r\nLord St. Helens to the Russian capital, and on the 17th of June a treaty\r\nwas concluded, which limited and defined the right of search, and which\r\nNapoleon denounced as “an ignominious treaty, equivalent to an admission\r\nof the sovereignty of the seas in the British parliament, and the slavery\r\nof all other states.” In the same year (October 4-8) Alexander also\r\nconcluded treaties of peace with France and Spain; for between Russia\r\nand the former power there had previously existed only a cessation of\r\nhostilities, without any written convention.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE INCORPORATION OF GEORGIA\r\n\r\nThe incorporation of Georgia with the empire, an event long prepared\r\nby the insidious means habitually employed by Russia, was consummated\r\nin this year. The people of Georgia have always had a high reputation\r\nfor valour, but at the end of the seventeenth century they suffered\r\nimmensely from the Tatars and the Lesghians. Russia supported Georgia,\r\nnot sufficiently indeed to prevent the enemy from destroying Tiflis,\r\nbut quite enough to prove to the country that, once under the Russian\r\nrule, it would be safe from the Mussulmans. Alexander’s manifesto of\r\nthe 12th of September, 1801, says that he accepts the weight of the\r\nGeorgian throne, not for the sake of extending the empire, already so\r\nlarge, but only from humanity! Even in Russia very few could believe\r\nthat the Georgians surrendered themselves to the czar from a spontaneous\r\nacknowledgment of the superiority of the Russian rule, and of its ability\r\nto make the people happy; to disabuse themselves of any such notion,\r\nthey had but to look at the queen of Georgia, Maria, who was detained at\r\nSt. Petersburg, in the Tauric palace--a name that might well remind her\r\nof the treacherous acquisition of another kingdom. She rode through the\r\nstreets in one of the court carriages, and her features expressed great\r\naffliction. The covering which she wore on her head, as usual in Georgia,\r\nprevented the people from seeing the scars of the sabre wounds she had\r\nreceived before she quitted the country. Her consort, George XIII, had\r\nbequeathed the kingdom to the Russians, but she protested against the\r\nact; and when the Russian colonel Lazarev came to carry her away to St.\r\nPetersburg, she refused to go with him. He was about to use violence,\r\nbut the queen took out a poniard from her bosom and stabbed him. The\r\ninterpreter drew his sabre and gave her several cuts on the head, so that\r\nshe fell down insensible.\r\n\r\n\r\nRUSSIA JOINS THE THIRD COALITION\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [1803 A.D.]]\r\n\r\nConcurrently with his domestic reforms, Alexander occupied himself\r\nin an extensive series of negotiations, having for their object the\r\ngeneral settlement of Europe upon such new bases as the results of the\r\nlast war had rendered necessary. In particular, he was engaged as joint\r\narbiter with Bonaparte in the matter of the indemnifications to be made\r\nto those princes who had lost a part or the whole of their possessions\r\nby the cession of the left bank of the Rhine. Alexander was secretly\r\ndissatisfied with the part he was made to play in these transactions,\r\nfor the authority which he shared in appearance with Bonaparte, was\r\nin reality monopolised by the latter. He abstained, however, from\r\nremonstrating, contenting himself for the present with the outward show\r\nof respect paid to his empire, and with a precedent which, added to that\r\nof Teschen, established in future the right of Russia to mix itself up in\r\nthe affairs of Germany. The Peace of Amiens between France and England\r\nwas broken, and a war was declared on the 18th of May, 1803, between\r\nthe two powers, which was ultimately to involve the whole of Europe.\r\nMeanwhile, many cases were arising to increase Alexander’s displeasure\r\nagainst Bonaparte.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ALEXANDER I\r\n\r\n(1777-1825)]\r\n\r\nThe relations between Russia and France were at this time of such a\r\nnature that the Russian chancellor, Vorontzov, said plainly, in a note\r\nof the 18th of July, that if the war were to be prolonged between France\r\nand England, Russia would be compelled finally to take part in it.\r\nBefore this declaration on the part of Russia, Bonaparte had a scene\r\nwith Markov, which alone might well have caused a rupture. He addressed\r\nthe Russian ambassador, in a public audience, so rudely and violently\r\nthat even Bignon, who is disposed to worship Bonaparte as a demi-god, is\r\nobliged to confess that his hero entirely lost his dignity, and forgot\r\nhis position.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [1803-1805 A.D.]]\r\n\r\nWhen Markov withdrew in November, he left his secretary of legation,\r\nD’Oubril, as acting ambassador in his place. Everyone, however, foresaw a\r\nbreach at no very distant period; and Russia had already, in the autumn\r\nof 1803, when nothing was to be done with Prussia, entered into a closer\r\nconnection with England. Negotiations were also commenced with Austria,\r\nand a union with Sweden and Denmark, for the purpose of liberating\r\nHanover, was spoken of. This was the state of affairs at the beginning of\r\n1804: the murder of the duke d’Enghien brought matters to a crisis. The\r\nmother of the Russian emperor had been all along hostile to everything\r\nproceeding from Bonaparte; and the mild and gentle spirit of the emperor,\r\nlike that of all persons of good feeling in Europe, was deeply wounded\r\nby the fate of the duke. From the beginning of 1804, he had no further\r\npolitical reasons for keeping up a friendly relation with France; he\r\ntherefore gave himself up entirely to his natural feelings on hearing of\r\nthe catastrophe at Vincennes.\r\n\r\nBy the declarations interchanged between the courts of St. Petersburg\r\nand Berlin (May 3rd and 24th, 1805), it was agreed that they should not\r\nallow the French troops in Germany to go beyond the frontier of Hanover;\r\nand that should this happen, each of the two powers should employ 40,000\r\nmen to repel such an attempt. A convention was also signed between Russia\r\nand Austria before the end of the year, and they agreed to set on foot\r\nan army of 350,000 men. England, under the administration of William\r\nPitt, added her strength to these combinations, and united the several\r\npowers in a third coalition for the purpose of wresting from France the\r\ncountries subdued by it since 1792, reducing that kingdom within its\r\nancient limits, and finally introducing into Europe a general system of\r\npublic right. The plan was the same as that which ten years afterwards\r\nwas executed by the Grand Alliance; it failed in 1805, because the\r\nparticipation of Prussia, on which the allies had reckoned, was, from the\r\nmost ignoble motives withheld.\r\n\r\nThe negotiations of the several treaties connected with the coalition,\r\noccupied the greater part of the year 1805. By the Treaty of St.\r\nPetersburg (August 11th), between Great Britain and Russia, it was agreed\r\nthat Alexander should make another attempt for arranging matters with\r\nBonaparte, so as to prevent the war. The Russian minister Novosiltzov was\r\nsent to Paris by way of Berlin, where he received the passports procured\r\nfor him from the French cabinet by that of Prussia; but at the same time,\r\norders reached him from St. Petersburg, countermanding his journey.\r\nThe annexation of the Ligurian Republic to France, at the moment when\r\nthe allies were making conciliatory overtures to Napoleon, appeared to\r\nthe emperor too serious an outrage to allow of his prosecuting further\r\nnegotiations. War was consequently resolved on.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CAMPAIGN OF AUSTERLITZ (1805 A.D.)\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [1805 A.D.]]\r\n\r\nNapoleon seemed to be wholly intent on his design of invading England.\r\nPart of his troops had already embarked (August 27th), when on a sudden\r\nthe camp of Boulogne was broken up, and the army put in march towards\r\nthe Rhine, which river it passed within a month after. Austria had set\r\non foot three armies. The archduke Charles commanded that of Italy; his\r\nbrother John was stationed with the second army on the Tyrol; and the\r\nthird was commanded nominally by the archduke Frederick, the emperor’s\r\ncousin, but in reality by General Mack. The first Russian army under\r\nKutusov had arrived in Galicia, and was continuing its march in all\r\nhaste. It was followed by another under Michelson. The Russian troops in\r\nDalmatia were to attempt a landing in Italy.\r\n\r\nMack having crossed the Inn (September 8th), and entered Swabia,\r\nNapoleon’s plan was to cut him off from the army of Kutusov, which\r\nwas marching through Austria. In this he succeeded by a violation of\r\nthe Prussian territory. Marmont, who had marched by way of Mainz, and\r\nBernadotte, who had conducted an army into Franconia, where they were\r\njoined by the Bavarians, traversed the country of Anspach, and thus came\r\non the rear of the Austrian army (October 6th). From that date, scarcely\r\na day passed without a battle favourable to the French. Several Austrian\r\ndivisions were forced to lay down their arms. Mack, who had thrown\r\nhimself into Ulm, lost all resolution, and capitulated with 25,000 men\r\n(October 19th). Mack’s army was thus totally dissipated, except 6000\r\ncavalry, with which the archduke Ferdinand had opened himself a passage\r\nthrough Franconia, and 20,000 men, with whom Kienmayer had retired to\r\nBraunau, where he was met by the vanguard of Kutusov. The two generals\r\ncontinued their retreat. The Russians repassed the Danube near Grein\r\n(November 9th), and directed their march towards Moravia. A few days\r\nafter (November 13th), Vienna fell into the hands of the French. The\r\nAustrians had renounced the design of defending their capital, but\r\ndecided that the passage of the river should be disputed.\r\n\r\nVienna is situated at some distance from the Danube, which flows to\r\nthe right of the city between wooded islands. The Austrians had placed\r\nexplosive materials under the floorings of the wooden bridge which\r\ncrosses the several arms of the river, and were ready to blow it up\r\nthe moment the French should show themselves. They kept themselves\r\nin readiness on the left bank, with their artillery pointed, and a\r\ncorps of 7000 or 8000 men, commanded by Count Auersberg. The French,\r\nnevertheless, got possession of the bridge by stratagem. Murat, Lannes,\r\nBelliard, and their staff, leaving their troops behind them, crossed the\r\nbridge, told the Austrians that an armistice was agreed on, and asked\r\nto see their general. He was sent for. Meanwhile, the French officers\r\nkept the Austrian gunners in conversation, and gave time for a column\r\nof French grenadiers to come up unseen, under cover of the woods, seize\r\nthe cannon, and disarm the artillerymen. The Austrian commander who had\r\ncome to the spot just at the critical moment, fell completely into the\r\ntrap. He himself led the French column over the bridge, and ordered the\r\nAustrian troops to be drawn up on parade to receive them as friends.\r\nThe possession of the bridge afforded the French troops the means of\r\nreaching Znaim sooner than Kutusov, and thus preventing his junction with\r\nBuxhövden.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Alexander had gone to Berlin, to exert his personal influence\r\nover the timorous king, and prevail on him to abandon his wretched\r\nneutral policy, in which there was neither honour, honesty, nor safety.\r\nAlexander was warmly seconded by the beautiful queen of Prussia, and by\r\nthe archduke Anthony, who arrived at the same time on a special mission\r\nfrom Vienna. French influence rapidly declined in Berlin; Duroc left it\r\non the 2nd of November, without having been able to obtain an audience,\r\nfor some days previously, either from the king or the emperor; and on the\r\nfollowing day a secret convention was signed between the two monarchs for\r\nthe regulation of the affairs of Europe, and the erection of a barrier\r\nagainst the ambition of the French emperor.\r\n\r\nThe Prussian minister Haugwitz, who had signed this convention only to\r\ngain time, and with a secret determination to elude its provisions, was\r\nto be entrusted with the notification of it to Napoleon, with authority,\r\nin case of its acceptance, to offer a renewal of the former friendship\r\nand alliance of the Prussian nation; but in case of refusal, to declare\r\nwar, with an intimation that hostilities would begin on the 15th of\r\nDecember--when they would be too late. Before that day came, Prussia\r\nrelapsed into her old temporising habits; her armies made no forward\r\nmovement towards the Danube, and Napoleon was permitted to continue\r\nwithout interruption his advance to Vienna, while 80,000 disciplined\r\nveterans remained inactive in Silesia; a force amply sufficient to have\r\nthrown him back with disgrace and disaster to the Rhine.\r\n\r\nA characteristic scene took place at Potsdam during Alexander’s visit.\r\nThe king, the queen, and the emperor went one night by torchlight into\r\nthe vault where lay the coffin of Frederick the Great. They knelt before\r\nit. Alexander’s face was bathed in tears; he pressed his friend’s hands,\r\nhe clasped him in his arms, and together they swore eternal amity: never\r\nwould they separate their cause or their fortunes. Tilsit soon showed\r\nwhat was the value of this oath, which probably was sincere for the\r\nmoment when it was taken.\r\n\r\nDuring the retreat of the Austrians and Russians under Kienmayer and\r\nKutusov from Passau to Krems, the imprudence of Mortier, who had crossed\r\nto the left bank of the Danube at Linz, gave occasion to engagements at\r\nStein and Dirnstein, in which the French lost more men than they ever\r\nacknowledged. Mortier’s army of 30,000 men consisted of three divisions,\r\nunder Generals Gazan, Dupont, and Dumonceau. This army had positive\r\norders to keep always near to the main body, which was pursuing its march\r\nalong the right bank, and never to advance beyond it. Kutusov had long\r\nretreated on the right bank; but on the 9th of November he crossed to\r\nthe left at Grein, as before mentioned, and lay in the neighbourhood of\r\nKrems, when Mortier’s troops advanced. The French divisions maintained\r\nthe distance of a whole day’s march one from another, because they\r\nthought they were following a fleeing army; but between Dirnstein and\r\nStein they fell in with the whole Russian army, 20,000 strong, at a place\r\nwhere the French were obliged to pass through a frightful ravine. On\r\nthe 11th of November, Mortier ventured to make an attack with Gazan’s\r\ndivision alone; but near Dirnstein (twenty hours from Vienna), he got\r\ninto a narrow way, enclosed on both sides by a line of lofty walls, and\r\nthere suffered a dreadful loss. When the French, about noon, at length\r\nsupposed themselves to have gained some advantage, the Russians received\r\nreinforcements, outflanked the French, cut them off, and would have\r\nannihilated the whole division, had not Dupont’s come up at the decisive\r\nmoment. The latter division had also suffered severely on the same day.\r\nWhilst Kutusov was sharply engaged with Mortier, whose numbers were being\r\nrapidly diminished, and his cannon taken, the Austrian general Schmidt\r\nattacked Dupont at Stein, where the contest was as murderous as at\r\nDirnstein, till Schmidt fell, and the French forced their way out.\r\n\r\nKutusov, on his march to Znaim, was overtaken by the van of the French,\r\nunder Belliard, near Hollabrunn; and everything depended on detaining\r\nthe latter so long as might enable Kutusov to gain time for getting\r\nin advance. For this purpose, Bagration, with about six thousand men,\r\ntook up a position in the rear of the main body. Nostitz served under\r\nBagration, and had some thousand Austrians and a number of Russians\r\nunder his immediate command. He occupied the village of Schöngraben,\r\nin the rear of the Russians, and in the very centre of their line of\r\nmarch. Belliard ought to have attacked him first; but as his corps was\r\nnot superior in number to that of Bagration, he had again recourse to\r\nthe expedient which he had already tried, with such signal success, at\r\nthe bridge of Vienna. He entered into a parley; declared that peace with\r\nAustria was already concluded, or as good as concluded; assured them\r\nthat hostilities henceforth affected the Russians alone; and by such\r\nmeans induced Nostitz to be guilty of a piece of treachery unparalleled\r\nin war. Nostitz, with his Austrians, forsook the Russians, even those\r\nwhom he had under his own command; and they being unable to maintain the\r\nvillage of Schöngraben, it was taken possession of without a shot; and\r\nBagration and Kutusov seemed lost, for Murat’s whole army was advancing\r\nupon them.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime the Russians at Hollabrunn extricated themselves from\r\ntheir difficulty; for they were not so stupidly credulous as the\r\nAustrians, but knew how to deceive the Gascons, by whom they were\r\npursued, as Belliard had deceived the Austrians. For this purpose,\r\nthey availed themselves of the presence in Kutusov’s camp of Count von\r\nWinzingerode, the adjutant-general of the emperor of Russia, who had been\r\nemployed in all the last diplomatic military negotiations in Berlin.\r\nMurat having sent his adjutant to call upon Kutusov, whose line of\r\nmarch had come into the power of the enemy, in consequence of Nostitz’s\r\ntreachery in capitulating, the Russian general assumed the appearance\r\nof being desirous to negotiate, and Winzingerode betook himself to the\r\nFrench camp. Belliard and Murat, without taking the trouble to inquire\r\nwhat powers the count and Kutusov had to conclude a treaty which should\r\nbe generally binding, came to an agreement with Winzingerode, by virtue\r\nof which all the Russians, within a certain number of days, were to\r\nevacuate every part of the Austrian territory. This capitulation was\r\nto be sent to the emperor Napoleon, at Schönbrunn, for confirmation;\r\nand to this condition there was necessarily attached another, for the\r\nsake of which Kutusov had commenced the whole affair. There was to be a\r\nsuspension of hostilities till the arrival of Napoleon’s answer; and it\r\nwas agreed that in the meantime both parties should remain in their then\r\npositions.\r\n\r\nBagration, with seven or eight thousand Russians, complied with this\r\ncondition, and remained in his position at Hollabrunn, because he\r\ncould be observed by the French; but Kutusov, with all the rest of the\r\narmy, which lay at a greater distance, quietly continued his route to\r\nZnaim; and this, with a full knowledge of the danger of Bagration being\r\nafterwards overwhelmed by a superior force. On being made acquainted with\r\nthe capitulation, Napoleon was enraged, for he immediately perceived how\r\ngrievously his brother-in-law had suffered himself to be deceived; and he\r\nordered an immediate attack. This was indeed made; but eighteen hours had\r\nbeen irreparably lost, and Kutusov gained two marches on Murat; the whole\r\nFrench army, above thirty thousand strong, therefore fell upon Bagration.\r\n\r\nBagration, who had still with him the Austrian regiment of hussars of the\r\ncrown-prince of Homburg, commanded by Baron von Mohr, offered a vigorous\r\nresistance to the whole French army with his seven or eight thousand\r\nmen. The Russian bombs set fire to the village in which was stationed\r\nthe corps which was to fall upon Bagration’s flank; the consequence was,\r\nthat this corps was thrown into confusion, and the Russians opened up a\r\nway for themselves at the point of the bayonet. The Russian general, it\r\nis true, was obliged to leave his cannon in the hands of his enemy, and\r\nlost the half of his force; it must, however, always be regarded as one\r\nof the most glorious deeds of the whole campaign, that, after three days’\r\ncontinued fighting, he succeeded in joining the main body under Kutusov,\r\nat his headquarters at Wischau, between Brünn and Olmütz, and, to the\r\nastonishment of all, with one-half of his little army. Even the French\r\nadmit that the Russians behaved nobly, that they themselves lost a great\r\nnumber of men, and that, among others, Oudinot was severely wounded.\r\n\r\nOn the same day on which Bagration arrived in Wischau, a junction had\r\nbeen formed by Buxhövden’s army, with which the emperor Alexander was\r\npresent, with the troops under Kutusov, who thenceforward assumed the\r\nchief command of the whole. Napoleon himself came to Brünn, and collected\r\nhis whole army around him, well knowing that nothing but a decisive\r\nengagement could bring him safely out of the situation in which he then\r\nwas, and which was the more dangerous the more splendid and victorious it\r\noutwardly appeared to be. It is beyond a doubt that the precipitation and\r\nhaughtiness of the Russians, who were eager for a decisive engagement,\r\ncombined with the miserable policy of the Prussian cabinet and the\r\ncowardice of the king, as well as the fears and irresolution of the poor\r\nemperor Francis, and the want of spirit among his advisers, contributed\r\nmore to the success of Napoleon’s plans respecting Prussia, Germany, and\r\nItaly, than his victories in the field.\r\n\r\nA glance at the situation of affairs at the time of the battle of\r\nAusterlitz will show at once how easily he might have been stopped in his\r\ncareer. There was nothing Napoleon feared more than that the Russians\r\nshould march either to Hungary or to Upper Silesia, and avoid a decisive\r\nengagement; he therefore took means to ascertain the characters and\r\nviews of the personal attendants and advisers of the emperor Alexander;\r\nand when he had learned that young men of foolhardy dispositions had\r\nthe preponderance in his councils, he formed his plans accordingly. He\r\nfirst advanced from Brünn to Wischau, and afterwards retired again into\r\nthe neighbourhood of Brünn, as if afraid to venture upon an attack. The\r\nemperor of Germany, as well as Napoleon, appeared seriously desirous\r\nof a peace; but the former was obliged to propose conditions which the\r\nlatter could not possibly accept; and Napoleon wished first completely\r\nto set the emperor Francis free from the Russians, his allies and from\r\nPrussia, before he came to an agreement with him. As Count Stadion, who\r\ncame to the headquarters of the French on the 27th of November, with\r\nGiulay, as ambassadors to treat for peace, was a sworn enemy of Napoleon,\r\nand remained so till 1813, and had, moreover, been very instrumental in\r\nfounding the whole coalition, and in maturing their plans, his appearance\r\non this occasion was of itself no good omen for the favourable issue of\r\nthe mission.\r\n\r\nThe proposals made as the basis of a peace were the same as had been\r\ncontemplated in the event of a victory on the part of the allies--the\r\nFrench were to evacuate Germany and Italy. When Napoleon sent Savary\r\n(afterwards duke of Rovigo), the head of his gendarmerie police, under\r\npretence of complimenting the emperor Alexander, it was indisputably a\r\ngreat part of this envoy’s object, as appears from the 30th bulletin, to\r\nmake himself thoroughly acquainted with the prevailing opinions and the\r\nleading characters during the three days of his sojourn in the emperor’s\r\ncamp. Savary was very well received, and sent away with every courtly\r\nattention by Alexander; but it was intimated that it was intended to make\r\ncommon cause with Prussia, and that it was expected that Novosiltzov,\r\nwhom the emperor Alexander wished to send to Napoleon, would meet\r\nHaugwitz in Brünn. The hint was sufficient to induce Savary to decline\r\nthe company of Novosiltzov.\r\n\r\nWhen Savary informed the emperor of the illusion of the Russian generals,\r\nand of their belief that fears were entertained of the Russians, and that\r\non this account embassies were sent to seek for peace--Napoleon very\r\ncunningly took care to strengthen the fools in their folly. Savary was\r\nsent again to the enemy’s camp to propose an interview between Napoleon\r\nand the emperor of Russia. The interview was declined; but Prince\r\nDolgoruki was sent to propose conditions to Napoleon. The latter did not\r\nallow him to come into his camp, but received him at the outposts.\r\n\r\nIf it be asked why the Russians, with whom there were only some twenty\r\nthousand Austrians, did not wait for their third army, under Bennigsen,\r\nor reduce Bonaparte to the greatest perplexity, by taking up a strong\r\nposition in Hungary or Upper Silesia, or remaining quietly upon the\r\nheights of Pratzen, the reply is, that the whole system of supplies was\r\nbad, and that want had reached so great a pitch, that it would have\r\nbeen impossible for them to remain. Certain it is that they suffered\r\nthemselves to be drawn down from the heights, and away from Austerlitz,\r\nnear Brünn, where the talents of their generals were unable to devise any\r\nplan of battle which Napoleon could not immediately oversee; it would\r\nhave been otherwise in the mountains. The French allege, that Napoleon\r\nhad long before fixed upon the very place in which the Russians offered\r\nhim battle at Austerlitz, on the 2nd of December, as his battle-field,\r\nand laid all his plans accordingly. The possession of the heights of\r\nPratzen was regarded by those skilled in strategy as the key of this\r\nbattle-field. The Russians were in full possession of these heights, with\r\nall their force, on the 1st of December; on the 2nd they descended from\r\nthem, when Bonaparte drew back one of the wings of his army. He had long\r\ncalculated on gaining the victory by the possession of these heights,\r\nand thus rendering the retreat of the Russians impossible. He did not,\r\ntherefore, fail, in the very opening of the battle, to seize upon them.\r\n\r\nA column of the third Russian army, under Bennigsen, commanded by\r\nMichelson, just arrived at the decisive moment when Napoleon had also\r\ncalled to his aid Bernadotte’s corps, and when the Bavarians were on\r\ntheir march from Budweis to Moravia; but none of their leaders could\r\nlay any claim to the reputation of a commander of genius. Napoleon’s\r\nproclamation to his army shows his full confidence in his own\r\nsuperiority, as well as in that of his generals and soldiers; and this\r\nconfidence was fully realised on the bloody field of Austerlitz on the\r\n2nd of December.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CAMPAIGN OF EYLAU AND FRIEDLAND (1806-1807 A.D.)\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [1806 A.D.]]\r\n\r\nAfter the defeat at Austerlitz the emperor made an attempt, whether\r\nsincere or not is uncertain, for a reconciliation with Napoleon. He sent\r\nD’Oubril to Paris, who, after a negotiation of ten days, concluded a\r\ntreaty with the French plenipotentiary, General Clarke (July 20th, 1806).\r\nBut Alexander refused to ratify the treaty, upon the very questionable\r\nallegation that his ambassador had exceeded his powers.\r\n\r\nPrussia now suffered the just consequences of her policy. Disappointed\r\nin her hopes of acquiring Hanover, the reward for which she crouched to\r\nNapoleon, she imprudently provoked him to war without waiting for the\r\narrival of the aid due to her by Russia. The campaign was decided in one\r\nday by the two terrific defeats of Jena and Auerstadt (October 14th,\r\n1806). Prussia was hopelessly ruined before the Russian armies, ninety\r\nthousand strong, under Bennigsen and Buxhövden, could arrive to save her.\r\nThe Russians entered Prussia in November, and on the 26th of December\r\nthe battle of Pultusk was fought with great obstinacy and loss of blood\r\non both sides. The French spent the whole of a December night without\r\ncovering; rain and snow fell incessantly; they waded up to their knees\r\nin marshes, spent twelve hours in making an advance of eight miles, and\r\nwere obliged to pay dearly for their passage over the Narev. During the\r\nbattle, Marshal Lannes and other generals were several times obliged to\r\nput themselves at the head of single regiments and battalions, and yet\r\nno decisive advantage was gained. The French, indeed, boasted of the\r\nvictory; because the Russians, after having maintained their ground on a\r\npart of the field, retreated the next day.\r\n\r\nIf the victory at Pultusk, of which Bennigsen boasted, and on account\r\nof which he was afterwards rewarded by his emperor, and appointed\r\ncommander-in-chief, was very doubtful, on the other hand, Prince Galitzin\r\ncompletely defeated the French at Golymin, on the very day on which\r\nthey were to attack Buxhövden, at Ostrolenka. This victory, too, was\r\nthe more glorious, inasmuch as the Russians were less numerous than\r\ntheir opponents. The French, however, had not been able to bring up\r\ntheir artillery; and the superiority of the Russians in this particular\r\ndecided the event. The weather and the time of the year rendered\r\nactive operations impossible for some weeks. Bennigsen retired to\r\nOstrolenka, and afterwards still farther; whilst the French, under Ney\r\nand Bernadotte, were scattered in the country on the farther side of the\r\nVistula, in which Ney at length pushed forward as far as Heilsberg.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [1807 A.D.]]\r\n\r\nIn January, 1807, Bennigsen and Napoleon came, almost simultaneously,\r\nupon the idea of changing the seat of war from the extreme east to\r\nthe west. In the east, the struggle was afterwards carried on by two\r\nparticular corps--a Russian, under Essen, and a French, first under\r\nLannes, and then under Savary. This bloody struggle, however, had no\r\ninfluence on the issue of the war. Bennigsen no sooner learned that Ney\r\nhad scattered his troops widely over the country on the farther side\r\nof the Vistula, than he broke up his quarters, and resolved to attack\r\nhim, before Bernadotte, who was near, could come to his relief; but he\r\nwas too late. Ney had already retreated when Bennigsen arrived; whether\r\nit was as the French allege, because Napoleon, who had seen the danger\r\nwith which he was threatened, sent him orders to retreat, which arrived\r\non the very day on which he was to be attacked by the Russians, or that\r\nGeneral Markov was at first too eager, and Bennigsen afterwards too\r\nirresolute. Ney luckily marched from Heilsberg, nearer to the Vistula,\r\nand Bennigsen followed him hesitatingly, so that Bernadotte was able to\r\nkeep him employed for some days till Napoleon came up. On receiving news\r\nof Bennigsen’s march, the French emperor had sent orders to all his corps\r\nto renew the campaign on the 27th, and he had so taken his measures, that\r\nbefore the Russians had any suspicion of an attack, the main army of\r\nthe French would fall upon their left flank, whilst they were on their\r\nmarch. For this purpose, Bernadotte was to allure Bennigsen quite to the\r\nVistula; and then to advance again as soon as Napoleon had outflanked the\r\nleft of the Russians.\r\n\r\nThe despatch containing these orders for Bernadotte fell into the hands\r\nof the Russians, through the inexperience of the officer entrusted with\r\nit, who failed to destroy the document at the right time. Thus warned\r\nof the impending danger, and finding themselves pressed on all sides,\r\nthey allowed their stores and heavy baggage, at various places, to fall\r\ninto the hands of the enemy, and thereby escaped being surrounded. After\r\nconsiderable sacrifices, they succeeded, on the 6th of February, in\r\nreaching the Prussian town of Eylau, which is only nine hours’ distance\r\nfrom Königsberg. Soult attacked their rear, on the low hills behind the\r\ntown, on the 7th, and drove them in; on the following day a general\r\nengagement took place. The honour of the victory is probably due to the\r\nRussians, as even Savary admits, who shared in the battle. It is not less\r\ncertain, however, that the whole advantage accrued to the French, who,\r\nindeed, admit that the battle was one of the most dreadful recorded in\r\nhistory. The French accuse Bernadotte of having, by his delay, prevented\r\nthe victory from being complete; whilst the Russians are just enough\r\nto admit that Lestocq, with his Prussians, saved their wing from utter\r\ndefeat. The number of deaths in the battle, and on the day preceding it,\r\nwas immense. Great numbers fell, not by the sword, but by cold, want, and\r\nexcessive exertion. Whole battalions and regiments of the French--as,\r\nfor example, that of Colonel Sémelé--were literally annihilated. Few\r\nprisoners were made, because the whole battle was fought with the bayonet.\r\n\r\nThe royal family of Prussia was placed in a very melancholy position by\r\nthe issue of the battle, for they were obliged, in the middle of winter,\r\nto flee to Menel, where they found themselves among Russians, of whom\r\ntheir own emperor alleged, that, notwithstanding his despotic power,\r\nhe was not able to restrain their barbarity, or to put a stop to their\r\nrapacity. Here, in the farthest corner of Prussia, they received news\r\nevery month of the fall of one fortress after another, or of forced\r\ncontributions levied upon their people.\r\n\r\nThe French army also retired after the battle of Eylau as well as the\r\nRussians. Bennigsen marched towards Königsberg, and although Berthier,\r\non the morning of the 7th, wrote to the empress that they would be\r\nin Königsberg with their army on the following day, the French,\r\nnevertheless, drew off nearer to the Vistula. Nothing important was\r\nundertaken by either party for some months, but vigorous preparations\r\nwere made for a new struggle; whilst new means were tried to prevent\r\nPrussia from taking any energetic measures--that is, from forming a close\r\nunion with England and Russia. The king hesitated between the bold advice\r\nof Hardenberg and his friends, and the unconditional submission to the\r\nwill of Napoleon, which was recommended by von Zastrov. The Russians were\r\nthoroughly dissatisfied with the English, and complained of being very\r\nbadly supported by them; they suffered want of all kinds, were worse\r\ntreated in many places in Prussia than the French, and even borrowed\r\n660,000 dollars in coin from the king of Prussia.\r\n\r\nHardenberg, who accompanied his master to Tilsit, succeeded in having\r\na new treaty entered into at Bartenstein between Russia and Prussia.\r\nIts principle was the same as that of the agreement made on the 12th of\r\nOctober, of the preceding year, at Grodno, by virtue of which the emperor\r\nbound himself to support the cause of the king with all his forces. In\r\nthis treaty, it was not only promised, just as if they were before Paris,\r\nthat Prussia should receive back all that had been lost, but it was\r\nformally determined what was to be done with the conquests wrested from\r\nFrance, and how even the left bank of the Rhine was to be partitioned\r\namong the allies.\r\n\r\nAbout this time Bennigsen was appointed commander-in-chief of the\r\nRussian armies; but he is generally accused of incapacity, and fearful\r\ndescriptions are given of the disorders, fraud, and embezzlement which\r\nprevailed, and of the plunder and barbarity which they practised against\r\nunfortunate Prussia. The emperor Alexander, as soon as he arrived at\r\nthe army, did everything in his power to restore order; he was able,\r\nhowever, only to remedy single abuses; even Nicholas, who manifests a\r\ndegree of severity from which Alexander shrank back, is not able to\r\nreach the source of the evil. Towards the end of May, Bennigsen thought\r\nhis troops already sufficiently reinforced to make an attack upon the\r\nFrench, and drive them across the Vistula; whilst the combined army of\r\nEnglish, Swedes, and Prussians, were to make an attack from Pomerania.\r\nThe French army, lying from Dantzic to the Narev, was brought, before the\r\nbeginning of June, when the campaign commenced, to 150,000 men, whose\r\npay and sustenance were drawn from the requisitions and contributions\r\nimposed on Prussia. In April, 1807, the French senate passed a decree\r\nlevying 80,000 conscripts, 60,000 of whom were to be immediately sent to\r\nthe army; and the Poles, too, deceived by the hope of the restoration of\r\ntheir nationality, raised a body of between 25,000 and 30,000 men, among\r\nwhom were whole regiments recruited by the Polish nobility, or formed\r\nexclusively of nobles who volunteered their service, although Napoleon\r\nlimited all the expectations of the Poles to the country on this side of\r\nthe Vistula.\r\n\r\nAs soon as Bennigsen, in the beginning of June, made a serious movement\r\nin advance towards the Vistula, a series of murderous engagements began,\r\nsimilar to those which preceded the battle of Eylau; on the 9th, the\r\nmain body of both armies came in sight of each other at Heilsberg, and\r\non the 10th the French made an attempt to drive the Russians from their\r\nposition. The united corps of Soult and Lannes, supported by the cavalry\r\nunder Murat, made repeated attempts to force the Russians to give way;\r\nthey, however, kept their ground.\r\n\r\nBennigsen afterwards heard, at Wehlau, that the French had separated into\r\ntwo divisions, and he resolved on the 13th, instead of continuing his\r\nroute on the farther side of the Alle, to wheel about before Wehlau, and\r\nattack the French. By this step, as all writers admit, he gave himself\r\ninto the hands of his great opponent, who never suffered his enemy to\r\ncommit a fault with impunity. The position taken up by Bennigsen was\r\nsuch as to leave him no alternative between victory and destruction, for\r\nhe had the Alle in his rear, and a marsh on one flank. Napoleon took\r\nadvantage of this mistake, as usual; and the orders which he issued\r\nbefore the battle prove that he was sure of the victory. About five\r\no’clock in the evening of the 14th of June, a battery of twenty guns\r\ngave the signal for the fight; it was bravely maintained on both sides,\r\nand both armies suffered great loss. The French accounts exaggerate the\r\nnumber of the Russians who were led into the battle of Friedland, as\r\nwell as the number of prisoners: certain it is, however, that seventeen\r\nthousand Russians were either killed or wounded.\r\n\r\nAfter the battle of Friedland, there was no longer any account to be\r\ntaken of the Prussians: and it was a piece of great good fortune that\r\nsuch a sovereign as Alexander reigned in Russia, otherwise Prussia would\r\nhave been wholly lost. Lestocq, with his Prussians, was obliged hastily\r\nto cross the Haff to Memel; and their magazines, considerable stores of\r\npowder and ammunition, together with one hundred thousand muskets, which\r\nthe English had sent by sea to Königsberg, fell, with the town, into the\r\nhands of the French. Bennigsen was not very closely pursued on the other\r\nside of the Alle; he passed the Niemen on the 19th, and burned down the\r\nbridge behind him; immediately afterwards, Bonaparte arrived in Tilsit.\r\nOf all the Prussian fortresses, Colberg alone might have been able to\r\nmaintain itself for some weeks, and Graudenz was saved merely by the\r\npeace. The treaty with England, which the Prussian minister signed in\r\nLondon on the 17th of June, and by which £1,000,000 sterling was promised\r\nin subsidies, came too late.\r\n\r\nSchladen informs us that all those who were about the king of Prussia had\r\nso completely lost courage, that Von Hardenberg, Von Stein, Von Schladen\r\nhimself, and many others who recommended perseverance, found none upon\r\nwhom they could reckon. With respect to the Russians, he informs us that\r\nthere was a party who assumed a threatening aspect--that the army was\r\ndissatisfied with the war--that the grand duke Constantine behaved often\r\nvery rudely towards the Prussians, and allowed himself to be used as an\r\ninstrument for working on the fears of his brother Alexander. On the 7th\r\nof June, the emperor manifested a disposition altogether contrary to\r\nthe agreements and partition-projects of the convention of Bartenstein.\r\nHe was dissatisfied with England, and perceived that the Austrians had\r\nno other object than to fish in troubled water, and he was, therefore,\r\ndesirous, as much as possible, to withdraw from the whole affair. He\r\nproposed a truce for himself, with a clause that the Prussians also\r\nshould obtain a cessation of hostilities; but the Russians and Prussians\r\nwere to negotiate each for themselves respecting the conditions.\r\nNapoleon having entertained the proposal, Russia agreed, that during the\r\ncontinuance of the truce, the French should retain possession of the\r\nwhole of Poland, except the circle of Bielostok. The agreement was signed\r\non the 21st, and a four weeks’ notice of the renewal of hostilities\r\nwas reserved. By the terms of the truce granted to Prussia, the French\r\nremained in possession of the whole kingdom; and the few fortresses which\r\nwere not yet reduced were not to be supplied either with new works,\r\nammunition, or provisions. Blücher, who commanded the Prussian auxiliary\r\nforces in Pomerania, was to leave the king of Sweden to his fate. The\r\npeace was to be negotiated at Tilsit, and for that purpose one half of\r\nthe town was to be declared neutral.[k]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Meeting of Alexander and Napoleon at Tilsit (1807 A.D.)_\r\n\r\nNapoleon desired, as far as means and powers would allow, to give all\r\npossible pomp and solemnity to the interview with his mighty adversary.\r\nWith this object, in the middle of the Niemen, opposite Tilsit, a raft\r\nwas constructed, on which were two pavilions, covered in white cloth. The\r\none which was destined for the two monarchs was of vaster dimensions and\r\nwas adorned with all possible luxury; the other and smaller one was for\r\ntheir suites. On the frontals of the pavilions were painted in green, on\r\nthe Russian side, an enormous A, and on the side turned towards Tilsit\r\nan N of equal size. To the annoyance of the Prussians, the monogram of\r\nFrederick William III was absent from the decorations of the Niemen raft.\r\nThe French guards were ranged in lines, fronting the river. “All this\r\narmy,” writes an eye-witness, “awaited the appearance of their invincible\r\nleader, their thunder-bearing semi-divinity, in order to greet him at the\r\nmoment of his swift passage to the wharf.” Thousands of the inhabitants\r\nof Tilsit and French soldiers covered the high left bank of the Niemen.\r\n\r\nThe emperors got into the boats simultaneously. When both boats put off,\r\nthe grandeur of the spectacle, the expectation of an event of world-wide\r\nimportance took the ascendency over all other feelings. Universal\r\nattention was concentrated upon the boat that carried that wonderful man,\r\nthat leader of armies, the like of whom had never been seen or heard\r\nof since the times of Alexander the Great and Julius Cæsar. Napoleon\r\nstood on the boat in front of his suite, solitary and silent, his arms\r\nfolded on his breast as he is represented in pictures. He wore the\r\nuniform of the Old Guard and the ribbon of the Legion of Honour across\r\nhis shoulder, and on his head that little historical hat, the form of\r\nwhich has become famous throughout the world. Reaching the raft somewhat\r\nsooner than Alexander, Napoleon rapidly got onto it, and hastened to\r\nmeet the emperor. The rivals embraced and silently entered the pavilion,\r\naccompanied by the joyful acclamations of the troops and the inhabitants,\r\nwho were witnesses of a world-wide event--the reconciliation of Russia\r\nand France. At that moment a large boat put off from the left bank of the\r\nNiemen, having on it about twenty armed soldiers--and remained between\r\nthe raft and the Russian shore. Evidently Napoleon did not hesitate\r\nto take open measures of safeguarding against any possible unforeseen\r\noccurrences.\r\n\r\nThat day the king of Prussia did not assist at the interview: Napoleon\r\ndid not wish to see him, and Frederick William remained on the right bank\r\nof the Niemen. “In that fateful hour, whilst the destiny of his monarchy\r\nwas being decided, his gaze was constantly fixed and his ear directed\r\ntowards the raft, as though he desired to listen to the conversation\r\nbetween the two emperors. Once he went down to the edge of the river and\r\nonly stopped when the water was up to his horse’s middle.” The first\r\ninterview between Alexander and Napoleon lasted an hour and fifteen\r\nminutes. “I detest the English no less than you do,” were the first words\r\nof the emperor Alexander, “and I am ready to support you in everything\r\nthat you undertake against them.” “If such is the case,” answered\r\nNapoleon, “then everything can be arranged and peace secured.”\r\n\r\nTaking advantage of Alexander’s inimical disposition towards Great\r\nBritain, Napoleon entered upon a terrible philippic against the perfidy\r\nof Albion, representing it as a greedy, extortionate nation ever ready to\r\nsacrifice everyone, even its most faithful allies, for its own profit.\r\nIn further conversation Napoleon strove to instil into Alexander that\r\nhe was victimised by his allies, that he was mistaken in protecting the\r\nGermans, those ungrateful and envious neighbours, and in supporting the\r\ninterests of a set of greedy merchants who showed themselves to be the\r\nrepresentatives of England; all this was occasioned, according to him, by\r\na feeling of generosity carried to excess, and by doubts which arose from\r\nthe incapacity or corruption of ministers. After this Napoleon began to\r\npraise the valour and bravery of the Russian troops, with which he had\r\nbeen much struck at Austerlitz, Eylau, and Friedland; he considered that\r\nthe soldiers on both sides had fought like veritable Titans and was of\r\nthe opinion that the united armies of Russia and France might dominate\r\nthe world, and give to it prosperity and tranquillity. Up till now Russia\r\nhad squandered her forces, without having any recompense in view; by\r\nan alliance with France she would acquire glory, and in any case reap\r\nsubstantial advantages. Of course Russia was bound by certain obligations\r\nto Prussia, and in that respect it was indispensable that the honour of\r\nthe emperor Alexander should be carefully guarded. In conclusion Napoleon\r\nexpressed his intention of restoring to Prussia sufficient territory\r\nhonourably to rid the emperor of his ally; after that, he affirmed, the\r\nRussian cabinet would be in a position to pursue a fresh line of policy\r\nsimilar in everything to that of the great Catherine. Only such a policy,\r\nin Napoleon’s opinion, could be possible and advantageous for Russia.\r\n\r\nHaving flattered Alexander as emperor, Napoleon in order to complete the\r\ncharm proceeded to flatter him as a man. “We shall come to an agreement\r\nsooner,” said he, “if we enter upon negotiations without intermediaries,\r\nsetting aside ministers, who frequently deceive or do not understand us;\r\nwe two together shall advance matters more in a single hour than our\r\nintermediaries in several days. Nobody must come between you and me; I\r\nwill be your secretary and you shall be mine,” added Napoleon. Upon this\r\nbasis he proposed to the emperor Alexander for convenience’s sake to\r\ntransfer the negotiations to Tilsit, declaring the position of the town\r\nto be a central one. The emperor gladly accepted Napoleon’s invitation,\r\nand it was settled that negotiations should at once be entered upon in\r\norder to come to a definitive agreement[55] on the matter.[g]\r\n\r\n\r\nRUSSIA DECLARES WAR AGAINST ENGLAND (1807 A.D.)\r\n\r\nThe English government, alleging that in the secret articles of the\r\ntreaty of Tilsit, of which they had possessed themselves, they had proof\r\nof Napoleon’s design to seize the Danish fleet, fitted out an expedition\r\nagainst Denmark with extraordinary celerity. Copenhagen was bombarded\r\nfor three days, and a great part of the city destroyed. The Danes then\r\ncapitulated (September 7), and surrendered their fleet to the English,\r\nwith all their naval stores in their arsenals and dockyards.\r\n\r\nThe expedition against Copenhagen was soon followed by a declaration of\r\nwar on the part of Russia against England. In the manifesto published\r\non this occasion (September 16th), Alexander complained bitterly of the\r\nbad faith of England, as manifested especially in the little aid she had\r\nafforded to the allies who had taken up arms in a cause in which she was\r\nmore directly interested than any other power, and in the robber-like\r\nact of aggression she had committed against Denmark. He annulled all\r\nformer conventions between Russia and England, especially that of 1801;\r\nproclaimed anew the principle of the armed neutrality; and declared that\r\nthere should be no communication between the two powers until Denmark had\r\nreceived just compensation, and peace was concluded between France and\r\nEngland. In consequence of this declaration, an embargo was laid on all\r\nthe English vessels in Russian ports, and Prussia was compelled to follow\r\nthis example.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CONQUEST OF FINLAND (1807 A.D.)\r\n\r\nIt was not till the 6th of October that a formal demand was made upon\r\nSweden to close the ports of the Baltic against English ships and trade.\r\nThe king persevered in his alliance with England; and finally, because\r\nthe emperor of Russia had conferred upon Napoleon the order of St.\r\nAndrew, he sent back his insignia; whereupon Alexander not only returned\r\nhis Swedish order, but quietly adopted measures to take possession of\r\nFinland, whilst the Danes were preparing, in concert with the French,\r\nto invade the western provinces of Sweden. Although in the months of\r\nNovember and December, Gustavus repeatedly declined the proposals of the\r\nRussians for a union against England, everything went on in Sweden as in\r\ntimes of the most profound peace; and even when the Russian forces were\r\ncollected on the very frontiers of Finland, the unfortunate king adopted\r\nno measures of defence whatever. On the 21st of January he was, for the\r\nlast time, called upon to declare war against England; he replied by\r\nconcluding a new alliance with her on the 8th of February. On the 21st,\r\nthe Russians invaded Finland, without any specific declaration of war,\r\nand on the 14th of March, 1808, Denmark declared war against Sweden.\r\nThe whole of Finland as far as Vasa, the island of Åland, and even the\r\nislands of Gotland, Åbo, Sveaborg, and all the fortresses, were taken\r\npossession of by the Russians even before the Swedish army and fleet were\r\nprepared. It was not till the end of April and beginning of May that a\r\nSwedish army under Klingspor and Aldercreutz, supported by a Swedish\r\nfleet, appeared in the field, and fought with various success.\r\n\r\nWe have lately seen Alexander take military possession of the Danubian\r\nprovinces as a “material guarantee,” whilst affecting not to be at war\r\nwith Turkey. This was in exact conformity with Russian precedents.\r\nFinland, as we have said, was occupied without a declaration of war; but\r\nmanifestoes were issued by General Buxhövden, one of which contained the\r\nfollowing passage: “Good neighbours, it is with the greatest regret that\r\nmy most gracious master, the emperor of all the Russias, sees himself\r\nforced to send into your country the troops under my orders. But his\r\nmajesty the king of Sweden, whilst withdrawing more and more from the\r\nhappy alliance of the two greatest empires in the world, draws closer\r\nhis connections with the common enemy, whose oppressive system and\r\nunparalleled conduct towards the most intimate allies of Russia and of\r\nSweden herself cannot be coolly endured by his imperial majesty. These\r\nmotives, as well as the regard which his imperial majesty owes to the\r\nsafety of his own states, oblige him to place your country under his\r\nprotection, and to take possession of it in order to procure by these\r\nmeans a sufficient guarantee in case his Swedish majesty should persevere\r\nin the resolution not to accept the equitable conditions of peace that\r\nhave been proposed to him, etc.”\r\n\r\nWhen the Russians took possession of Finland, the king gave them a\r\npretence for incorporating it with their empire, which, however, they\r\nwould no doubt have done in any case. He caused Alopeus, the Russian\r\nambassador, to be arrested. This took place on the 3rd of March, and\r\non the 25th a declaration was published on the part of the emperor of\r\nRussia, announcing to all the powers that “from that moment he regards\r\nthe part of Finland hitherto reputed Swedish, and which his troops had\r\nonly been able to occupy after divers battles, as a province conquered by\r\nhis arms, and that he unites it forever to his empire.”\r\n\r\nIt was easy to anticipate that the superior force of the Russians must in\r\nthe end prevail; although the Russian garrison in Gotland, and that in\r\nthe island of Åland, were at first taken prisoners, the island occupied,\r\nand the Russians beaten by land at Vasa on the 26th of July, and by sea\r\nat Roggerwick on the 26th of August. The Swedes lost all the advantages\r\nthey had thus gained by the bloody battle fought at Ormais on the 14th\r\nof September, and by the defeat at Lokalar on the 18th. The Russian\r\ngenerals, probably in order to give courage to the malcontents, who were\r\nvery numerous in Sweden, issued orders not to receive any letters or\r\nany flags of truce which were sent in the king’s name, and carried on\r\nnegotiations with the Swedish generals alone, for a suspension of arms,\r\nwhich was concluded for an indefinite time, on the 20th of September,\r\nbut only continued till the 27th of October, when the Russians resumed\r\nhostilities, and the Swedes were driven to the north, across the\r\nKemistrom. On the 20th of November a new truce was agreed upon between\r\nthe Swedish general Adlercreutz and the Russian general Kamenskoi, with\r\nthe reserve of fourteen days’ notice before renewal of operations. By the\r\nconditions of this agreement the Swedes were to evacuate the whole of\r\nUleåborg, and to retire completely behind the Kemistrom, with all their\r\nartillery, arms, and stores.\r\n\r\nOn the 13th of March in the following year a revolution was effected\r\nin Sweden, by which Gustavus was deposed; his uncle, the duke of\r\nSödermanland, became regent, and was afterwards proclaimed king (June 5,\r\n1809) under the title of Charles XIII. At Stockholm the people flattered\r\nthemselves that the dethronement of Gustavus would speedily bring\r\npeace to Sweden; but it was not so. Alexander refused to treat with a\r\ngovernment so insecure as a regency, and hostilities continued. General\r\nKnorring who had passed the Gulf of Bothnia on the ice with twenty-five\r\nthousand Russians, took possession of the Åland islands, and granted the\r\nSwedes a cessation of hostilities, to allow them time to make overtures\r\nof peace. Apprised of this arrangement, Barclay de Tolly, who had crossed\r\nthe gulf with another body of Russians towards Vasa, and taken possession\r\nof Umeå, evacuated west Bothnia, and returned to Finland. A third Russian\r\narmy, under Shuvalov penetrated into west Bothnia by the Torneå route,\r\nand compelled the Swedish army of the north under Gripenberg to lay down\r\ntheir arms (March 25th). This sanguinary affair occurred entirely through\r\nignorance; because in that country, lying under the 66th degree of north\r\nlatitude, they were not aware of the armistice granted by Knorring. On\r\nthe expiry of the truce, hostilities began again in May, and the Russians\r\ntook possession of the part of west Bothnia lying north of Umeå.\r\n\r\nThe peace between Russia and Sweden was signed at Frederikshamm on the\r\n17th of September. The latter power adhered to the continental system,\r\nreserving to herself the importation of salt and such colonial produce as\r\nshe could not do without. She surrendered Finland, with the whole of east\r\nBothnia, and a part of west Bothnia lying eastward of the river Torneå.\r\nThe cession of these provinces, which formed the granary of Sweden and\r\ncontained a population of 900,000 souls, was an irreparable loss to that\r\nkingdom which had only 2,344,000 inhabitants left. In the following year\r\nBernadotte, prince of Ponte Corvo, was elected crown prince of Sweden,\r\nand eventual successor to the throne, under the name of Charles John.\r\n\r\nThe loss of Finland had been but slightly retarded by some advantages\r\ngained over the Russian fleet by the combined squadrons of England and\r\nSweden. The Russian vessels remained blockaded on the coast of Esthonia,\r\nbut in an unassailable position, from which they were at last delivered\r\nby the weather and the exigencies of navigation in those dangerous seas.\r\nAnother Russian fleet under Admiral Siniavin, which sailed to Portugal to\r\nco-operate with the French against the English, was obliged to surrender\r\nto Admiral Cotton after the convention of Cintra. It was afterwards\r\nrestored to Russia. The war declared by that power against England in\r\n1807, was little more than nominal, and was marked by no events of\r\nimportance.\r\n\r\n\r\nWAR WITH PERSIA AND WITH TURKEY\r\n\r\nThe annexation of Georgia to Russia, effected as we have seen, in the\r\nbeginning of Alexander’s reign, drew him into a war with Persia, which\r\ndid not terminate until 1813. The principal events of that war were the\r\ndefeat of the Persians at Etchmiadzin by Prince Zitzianov (June 20,\r\n1804); the conquest of the province of Shirvan by the same commander\r\n(January, 1806); the taking of Derbent by the Russians (July 3rd); and\r\nthe defeat of the Persians by Paulucci, at Alkolwalaki (September 1st,\r\n1810).\r\n\r\nAbout 1805 the condition of the Ottoman Empire, badly organised and worse\r\ngoverned, was such that everything presaged its approaching dissolution.\r\nEverywhere the sultan’s authority was disregarded. Paswan Oglu, pasha of\r\nWiddin, was in open revolt. Ali Pasha of Janina was obedient only when it\r\nsuited his convenience. Djezzar, the pasha of Syria, without declaring\r\nhimself an enemy to the Porte, enjoyed an absolute independence. The\r\nsect of the Wahhabees was in possession of Arabia. After the departure\r\nof the English from Egypt, first the beys, and afterwards Muhammed Ali\r\nreigned over that country, and only paid their yearly tribute to the\r\nsultan when they pleased. In Servia, Czerni George was making himself\r\nindependent prince of the Slavonians of the Danube. Ipsilanti and Morusi,\r\nboth Greeks, by the permission, or rather by the command of Russia,\r\nwere appointed hospodars of Moldavia and Wallachia, for seven years at\r\nleast, and were therefore rather subjects of the Russians than of the\r\nTurks. Selim III, who had reigned since 1789, convinced that the Porte\r\ncould never re-establish its authority except by better organising the\r\narmy, had endeavoured to model it on the European system. This attempt\r\nafterwards cost him his throne.\r\n\r\nThe English and Russian ambassadors ruled either alternately or together\r\nin Constantinople. But for their interference the old friendship between\r\nFrance and the Porte would most likely have been restored in July,\r\n1802. At the time of the foundation of the empire in France, the sultan\r\nhesitated long whether he would lean upon the English and Russian, or\r\nupon the French influence, for he felt a great want of confidence in\r\nNapoleon, since he had been informed by the English of the language\r\nwhich fell from the emperor in conversation with Lord Whitworth. He\r\nwas reported to have taken the partition of Turkey for granted--as a\r\nthing unavoidable; and that on such partition the province of Egypt\r\nought necessarily to fall to the share of France. This conversation was\r\nprinted, in 1803, among the documents connected with the renewal of the\r\nwar between England and France, and was communicated to the sultan. The\r\nFrench, indeed, in their official journals, contradicted the allegation;\r\nbut who ever put any faith in their official journals?\r\n\r\nOn this ground we must explain the fact that the Turks favoured the\r\nRussians in the war which they were carrying on with the Persians;\r\nsuffered them to sail up the Rion (ancient Phasis), and even to build\r\na fort at its mouth. They were even desirous of renewing the friendly\r\nalliance formed with Russia in 1798, which renewal, indeed, the emperor\r\nof Russia was afterwards unwilling to confirm, because the English had\r\ntaken care to have the inviolability of the Turkish Empire incorporated\r\nin the treaty of 1798. Had, therefore, the emperor of Russia ratified\r\nthe alliance, he would have guaranteed to the Turks the actual condition\r\nof their empire in Europe, which he did not wish to do. This excited the\r\nsuspicion of the Turks, who inclined more and more towards the French,\r\nand did not suffer themselves to be frightened by the threats of the\r\nEnglish and Russians. Immediately after the Peace of Presburg, the Turks,\r\nwho had previously acknowledged Napoleon’s empire, sent a new ambassador\r\nto Paris. In return, Napoleon sent engineers, officers, artillerymen,\r\nworkmen, and materials, in order to enable the sultan to improve his\r\narmy, artillery, and the bulwarks of his empire; whilst, on the other\r\nhand, the Russian ambassador, Italinski, and the English ambassador,\r\nArbuthnot, threatened war if the alliance with the French was not\r\nrelinquished; and Italinski’s threats fell with a double weight because a\r\ncorps of Russians were ready for action on the Bug.\r\n\r\nAbout the time at which Napoleon adopted the resolution of attacking\r\nPrussia also, and therefore foresaw a war with Russia, a Turkish army\r\nwas assembled to take the field against the Russians on the Turkish\r\nfrontiers, and Napoleon clearly saw how advantageous to him a war between\r\nthe Russians and the Turks would be. He therefore sent General Sébastiani\r\nas ambassador extraordinary to Constantinople. Sébastiani arrived there\r\nin August, 1806; and soon gained so great an influence that for some time\r\nthe Divan was entirely under his direction. At his instance it refused\r\nto renew the treaty of alliance with England, which was on the point of\r\nexpiring; and it dismissed Ipsilanti and Morusi, as creatures of Russia,\r\nfrom their offices. In consequence of the threatening language held by\r\nArbuthnot, the English ambassador, they were reinstated; but when this\r\ntook place hostilities had already begun. The emperor Alexander had\r\nordered General Michelson to enter Moldavia and Wallachia. The Porte then\r\ndeclared war against Russia (December 30th); but deviating for the first\r\ntime from a barbarous custom, it allowed Italinski, the Russian minister,\r\nto depart unmolested.\r\n\r\nA few days afterwards, Arbuthnot quitted Constantinople, after having\r\nrepeatedly demanded the renewal of the alliance and the expulsion of\r\nSébastiani. On the 19th of February, 1807, an English fleet, commanded\r\nby Vice-Admiral Duckworth, forced the passage of the Dardanelles, and\r\nappeared before Constantinople. Duckworth demanded of the Divan that the\r\nforts of the Dardanelles and the Turkish fleet should be surrendered\r\nto him; that the Porte should cede Moldavia and Wallachia to Russia,\r\nand break off alliance with Napoleon. But instead of profiting by the\r\nsudden panic which his appearance had excited, he allowed the Turks time\r\nto put themselves in a posture of defence. Encouraged and instructed by\r\nSébastiani, they made their preparations with such energy and success\r\nthat in the course of eight days the English vice-admiral found that he\r\ncould not do better than weigh anchor and repass the Dardanelles.\r\n\r\nShortly afterwards Admiral Siniavin appeared in the Archipelago, and\r\nincited the Greek islanders to throw off the Turkish yoke; whilst\r\nDuckworth sailed to Egypt upon a fruitless expedition in favour of the\r\nmameluke beys against Muhammed Ali. Siniavin defeated the Turkish fleet\r\non the 4th of April, captured several ships, and took possession of some\r\nislands. The bad condition of his ships, however, compelled him to give\r\nup the blockade of the Dardanelles, and to retire, in order to refit,\r\nafter having another time defeated the Turkish fleet. Meanwhile, Selim\r\nhad been deposed. His successor, Mustapha IV, declared that he would\r\ncontinue to prosecute the war with England and Russia. But Siniavin,\r\nbefore he retired to refit, met the Turkish fleet off Lemnos, on the 1st\r\nof July: the Turks were beaten, lost several ships, and a great many men.\r\n\r\nThe campaign of the Russians on the Danube, in 1807, was not productive\r\nof any decisive result, as General Michelson received orders to detach\r\nthe third army corps to oppose the French in Poland, Czerni George,\r\nthe leader of the revolted Servians, took Belgrade, Shabatz, and Nish,\r\npenetrated into Bulgaria, where he was reinforced by some Russian troops,\r\nand gained divers signal advantages. The war was conducted with more\r\nsuccess on the frontiers of the two empires in Asia. The seraskier of\r\nErzerum was entirely defeated by General Gudovitch (June 18); and that\r\nvictory was the more important, as it prevented the Persians from making\r\na bold diversion in favour of the Turks.\r\n\r\nThe emperor Alexander had agreed by the public articles of the Treaty\r\nof Tilsit (July, 1807) to evacuate Moldavia and Wallachia; but this was\r\nonly a collusion between the two contracting parties. The Russians not\r\nonly aimed at the permanent possession of the two provinces, but regarded\r\nall the Slavonians of the Danube as allies or subjects of the czar. When\r\nthe Turks, on the 14th of July, concluded a peace with Czerni George,\r\nwhereby Servia became in some measure independent--and Czerni George\r\nafterwards called himself prince of Servia--a Russian general guaranteed\r\nthe treaty by his signature, as one of the parties to the agreement. In\r\nthe following year Radovinikin, a Russian envoy, repaired to Belgrade\r\nto establish the new principality; called an assembly of the nobles;\r\ndrew up a sketch of a constitution for Servia, and tried to organise the\r\nadministration.\r\n\r\nThe French general, Guilleminot, was sent to the Turkish camp to\r\nnegotiate a truce on the terms ostensibly laid down in the Treaty of\r\nTilsit: namely, that the Russians should evacuate Moldavia and Wallachia,\r\nbut that the Turks should not occupy the two provinces until after\r\nthe conclusion of a definitive peace. But Guilleminot’s instructions\r\ncontained a direct command to use the whole weight of the French\r\ninfluence in favour of the Russians and against the Turks; even one of\r\nNapoleon’s greatest admirers, although owning occasional republican\r\nscruples, admits that their tone was very equivocal. In fact, it very\r\nsoon became obvious that the whole mission of the general was a mere\r\npiece of diplomatic imposture and treachery. A congress was held at\r\nSlobozia, in the neighbourhood of Giurgevo, on the 24th of August, 1807,\r\nand a truce was signed, which, it was said, was to continue till the 30th\r\nof April, 1808. The Russians were to withdraw; the fortresses of Ismail,\r\nBraila, and Giurgevo to be given up to the Turks, whose troops, however,\r\nwere to evacuate Moldavia and Wallachia in thirty-five days. Everything,\r\nhowever, which afterwards took place in consultation between the French\r\nand Russians, in reference to Turkey, bore upon a scheme of partition.\r\n\r\nThe Russians at length, on the 7th of August, had left Cattaro and the\r\nother strong places in Dalmatia to the French; their emperor, on the\r\n9th, had ceded all his rights as protector of the republic of the seven\r\nunited islands to Napoleon, and the latter was busy making preparations\r\nthence to extend his operations and his dominion further to the east.\r\nMarmont, who administered the province of Dalmatia, received orders to\r\nfortify Ragusa more strongly, and to make a report on the best plan to\r\nbe adopted in case it should be desirable to send an army quickly from\r\nCorfu, through Albania, Macedonia, and Thrace. The Russians continued\r\nto be quiet observers of all this, and in the mean time made firm their\r\nfooting in the provinces on the Danube. They made a pretence of the\r\nconduct of the Turks on the occupation of Galatz, and their ill-treatment\r\nof the inhabitants of Moldavia, for not fulfilling the agreement entered\r\ninto at Slobozia. The Russian troops, who, according to the terms of the\r\ntreaty, were already retiring, received contrary orders; and the Turks,\r\nagain driven out of the two provinces, occupied Galatz anew.\r\n\r\nThe conduct of the negotiation respecting the division of the Turkish\r\nbooty, was committed to the chief of Napoleon’s secret police, who had\r\nbeen actively engaged in the murder of the duke d’Enghien. He now held\r\na princely rank as the duke of Rovigo, and was sent to St. Petersburg\r\nwith this and similar commissions. In the Russian capital the emperor\r\nAlexander and the duke acted as rivals in the art of dissimulation; the\r\nemperor loaded him with civilities of all kinds, as some compensation\r\nfor the coolness and contempt with which he was at first treated, to a\r\nsurprising extent, by the empress-mother and the Russian nobility. He\r\nwas, indeed, soon consoled, for the slaves of the czar were as zealous\r\nin showing respect in the presence of their master, as they were gross\r\nin their insolence when not under his observation. The accounts which\r\nSavary gives us of the political principles of the pious emperor and his\r\nchancellor, and their complete agreement with Napoleon’s morality and\r\nhis own, would be quite incredible to us, did he not literally quote\r\ntheir words. Savary’s secret report to the emperor Napoleon, partly\r\nwritten in the form of a dialogue, is to be found among the fragments of\r\nNapoleon’s unprinted correspondence. A contempt for public agreements,\r\nand the plunder of Sweden, even before the declaration of war, astonish\r\nus less than Romanzov’s audacious contempt of the opinion of all Europe;\r\nhe thought it not worth a moment’s consideration; and this was quite\r\nin accordance with the language held by his master in speaking on the\r\nsubject of Turkey. Thibaudeau has given so correct an opinion of both the\r\nemperors--of the nature of their consultations--of Savary and Romanzov\r\nthat we cannot do better than refer the reader to the words of that\r\nwriter.\r\n\r\nTurkey would at that time undoubtedly have been partitioned, had Austria\r\nbeen willing to follow the numerous gentle hints to join the alliance of\r\nthe emperors, who imagined themselves able to make their will the right\r\nand law of all nations; or if Napoleon had not found it inconsistent with\r\nhis plans to bring on at an unfavourable moment a new war with Austria,\r\nwhich he clearly foresaw in 1808. The Russians, in the mean time,\r\nremained, throughout the whole of the year 1808, in quiet possession of\r\nthe provinces which had been previously evacuated by them, and ruled\r\nnot only in them, but extended their dominion as far as Belgrade, for\r\nthe new prince of Servia was likewise under Russian protection. The\r\narmy under the command of the grand vizir, which lay at Adrianople\r\nduring the winter of 1807-1808, dwindled, during the continuance of\r\nthe truce of Slobozia, to a few thousand men, because, according to\r\nancient custom, the janissaries returned to their homes in winter; it\r\nagain increased, however, in the beginning of summer. Bairaktar’s army,\r\nwhich was organised on the new European principle, was computed at\r\nfrom twenty to thirty thousand men; it remained on the Danube till its\r\nleader, at length, resolved to put an end to the anarchy prevailing in\r\nConstantinople. He deposed Mustapha IV, who supported the faction of the\r\njanissaries, and placed his brother, Mahmud, on the throne. Bairaktar\r\nperished, however, in an insurrection (November 14th), and Mahmud, too,\r\nwould have been murdered, had he not been the last scion of the imperial\r\nfamily. But he was compelled entirely to change his ministry, and to\r\nresign the government into the hands of those who enjoyed the favour of\r\nthe ulemas and the janissaries.\r\n\r\nDuring the disturbances in the internal affairs of the Turkish Empire,\r\nthe foreign relations continued the same as they were in the year 1807,\r\nimmediately after the truce of Slobozia. When Napoleon’s plan of removing\r\nthe negotiations respecting a peace between the Russians and the Turks\r\nto Paris failed of success, he found it advisable, in consequence of\r\nan impending war with Austria, to give the Turks into the hands of the\r\nRussians. One of the chief causes of the war between France and Austria\r\nin 1809 was the close union between the latter power and England in\r\nreference to Turkish affairs, which appeared in the co-operation of\r\nLord Paget and Baron von Stürmer, the English and Austrian ambassadors\r\nin Constantinople. It was the Austrians who mediated the peace\r\nbetween England and the Porte of the 5th of January, 1809, after the\r\nconclusion of which the Turks refused to cede Moldavia and Wallachia\r\nto the Russians, at the congress of Jassy, as they had formerly done\r\nat Bucharest. This led to a new war, of which we shall have to speak\r\nhereafter.\r\n\r\n\r\nCONGRESS OF ERFURT (1808 A.D.)\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [1808 A.D.]]\r\n\r\nIn consequence of the complete stoppage of trade which followed the\r\ndeclaration of war in 1807, Russia suffered much more severely than\r\nEngland, and the Russian magnates, supported by the aversion of the\r\nemperor’s mother to Napoleon, were very far from showing that good-will\r\nto the French which their emperor manifested for Napoleon and his\r\nrepresentatives. This was soon experienced by Savary, duke of Rovigo,\r\nwho, though overloaded with marks of politeness by the emperor, in\r\nreality proved unable to make any way at the court of St. Petersburg.\r\nCaulaincourt, duke of Vicenza, was afterwards deceived for some years\r\nby appearances, and by Alexander’s masterly art of dissimulation; but\r\nNapoleon soon came to experience in Spain that the personal proofs of\r\nfriendship exhibited by the emperor were by no means always in accordance\r\nwith the Russian policy. The emperor Alexander himself, for example, on\r\nthe urgent request of Caulaincourt, acknowledged Joseph Bonaparte as king\r\nof Spain; whilst Strogonov, the Russian ambassador in Madrid, alleged\r\nthat he had no instructions to that effect, and corresponded with the\r\ninsurgents. In the same way, Admiral Siniavin, who, on the breaking out\r\nof war with England, had taken refuge in Lisbon with nine ships of the\r\nline and a frigate, not only refused to render any assistance to Marshal\r\nJunot, who was threatened in that city by the English, but even to make a\r\ndemonstration as if he were prepared to assist him. The manner in which\r\nhe afterwards capitulated, on the 3rd of September, 1808, to Admiral\r\nCotton, who caused his ships to be taken to England, might indicate a\r\nvery different disposition, especially as the ten ships were afterwards\r\ngiven back.\r\n\r\nThere was, indeed, no want of interchange of civilities between the two\r\nemperors. Whoever compares the attentions and marks of regard which\r\nhave been recorded as shown by the one to the other with the secret\r\nintrigues which they were at the same moment weaving against each other\r\nin Turkey and Spain, and with the open enmity which was shown as early\r\nas 1811, will learn from such a comparison what is the real worth of\r\ndiplomatic and princely friendships. The emperor of Russia made presents\r\nto his imperial brother of vessels and ornaments of malachite and other\r\nprecious stones, which the latter exhibited in the Salon du Prix in the\r\nTuileries, in order to be able to boast of the friendship of the emperor\r\nof Russia in presence of the circles of the faubourg St. Germain. Busts\r\nof Alexander were manufactured in the imperial porcelain manufactory\r\nat Sèvres, and were everywhere to be seen in the palace and rooms of\r\nthe imperial family. All who had access to the court, or wished to make\r\nthemselves agreeable to the emperor, found it necessary to purchase\r\nthese ornaments, and place them conspicuously in their houses. The\r\nfriendship was so intimate that one of the emperor of Russia’s adjutants\r\naccompanied the emperor of the French when he went to Bayonne to set\r\naside the whole reigning family of Spain. This adjutant, however, was\r\nthe same Tchernitchev who was engaged in constantly travelling backwards\r\nand forwards between St. Petersburg and Paris, who surrounded Napoleon,\r\nin spite of all his police, with a net of Russian espionage, and bribed\r\nall the employés who were venal in order to obtain papers. He intrigued\r\nwith ladies to elicit secrets from them; and finally, in 1812, he even\r\npurchased a copy of the plan of operations for the war, when it was too\r\nlate to change it.\r\n\r\nNapoleon knew that Austria was thinking of taking advantage of the\r\ngeneral discontent and the secret associations in Germany to frustrate\r\nthe plans of France and Russia with respect to Poland and Turkey; he\r\nwas, therefore, very desirous of assuring himself once more of the\r\nRussian emperor before his journey to Spain. This design was a cause\r\nof great anxiety to the very numerous partisans of the English and\r\nPrussian policy at the Russian court, when the question was raised of\r\na conference between the two emperors in Erfurt. Von Schladen, the\r\nfriend of the minister von Stein, therefore presented a memorial to the\r\nemperor of Russia, shortly before his departure to Erfurt on the 7th of\r\nSeptember, 1808, in which Alexander was forewarned of all that would take\r\nplace there. From this it may be seen that the emperor of Russia was\r\ncontinually receiving secret counsel and warning from the enemies of the\r\nFrench, and that he played his part in Erfurt more ably than Napoleon,\r\nfrom whom he separated, as even the French writers report, with all the\r\noutward signs of indescribable friendship and esteem, but inwardly full\r\nof distrust. Von Schladen says very freely to the emperor, that he had\r\ngiven him the advice laid down in his memorial, “in order that he might\r\nsee through the sophisms, falsehoods, and deceptions which were prepared\r\nfor him by Napoleon, and awaited him in Erfurt.”\r\n\r\nOn his way to the congress, the emperor visited the king and queen of\r\nPrussia in Königsberg, and arrived on the 26th of September in Weimar,\r\nwhere his brother Constantine had been staying since the 24th. On the\r\n27th Napoleon entered Erfurt, and at one o’clock drove out a distance\r\nof several miles from the town to meet the emperor of Russia, who was\r\ncoming from Weimar. Our modest object does not permit us to incorporate\r\nin our prose the poetry of the subsequent festivities, nor in glowing\r\nlanguage to extol the skill displayed by the masters of the ceremonies.\r\nThat splendour enough was exhibited in Erfurt may be sufficiently\r\ngathered from the fact that the four vassal-kings of the confederation\r\nof the Rhine, thirty-four princes, twenty-four ministers of state, and\r\nthirty generals, were by express command to summon up for the occasion\r\neverything which imagination could suggest in the way of courtly\r\nsplendour and extravagance. Talma and the Parisian company of actors had\r\nbeen sent to Erfurt, to act, as Napoleon said, before a pit of kings.\r\nTwo armchairs were placed for the two emperors, whilst the other rulers\r\nsat behind them on common chairs. We know not what truth there was in\r\nthe story, which was at that time in every mouth, and related in all\r\nthe French works written for effect, that the emperor Alexander, whilst\r\nTalma was being applauded on the stage, played his own part with Napoleon\r\nin the pit in quite as masterly a manner. The latter, amidst applause,\r\npronounced the following line:\r\n\r\n    The friendship of a great man is a favour of the gods.\r\n\r\nwhen the emperor seized Napoleon’s hand, made a profound bow, and\r\nfeelingly exclaimed: “That I have never more truly felt than at the\r\npresent moment.” The festivities continued from the 27th of September\r\ntill the 14th of October, and furnished to the Germans the most\r\nmelancholy spectacle of their princes and nobles conducting themselves\r\npublicly, not only as slaves of Napoleon, but even as servants and\r\nflatterers of all his generals and courtiers.\r\n\r\nIn order to flatter the emperor of Russia, Napoleon acted as if he had\r\nbeen influenced by Alexander’s application in favour of Prussia; but in\r\nreality, oppressed the king and his subjects afterwards just as before.\r\nHe profited by Alexander’s admiration and friendship to make a show of\r\nhis pretended willingness to conclude a peace with England. Though he\r\nhad written three times directly to the king of England, and had always\r\nbeen referred to the minister, he nevertheless prevailed upon Alexander\r\nto unite with him in signing another letter addressed to King George. The\r\nresult was such as might have been foreseen; the object, however, was\r\nattained: the letters and answers were printed, and officially commented\r\nupon in the journals.\r\n\r\nThe negotiations were carried on personally in Erfurt between the two\r\nemperors themselves, and much was agreed upon which neither the one nor\r\nthe other intended to observe. A written treaty of alliance was besides\r\nconcluded by Romanzov and Champagny, which was calculated with a view\r\nto a new war with Austria. The substance of the agreement consists in\r\na closer alliance of the two powers against England, and the cession\r\nof Moldavia and Wallachia to Russia. Hitherto Napoleon had only been\r\nwilling to concede this last point on conditions which referred to\r\nSilesia. In the fifth article of the Treaty of Erfurt, which was kept\r\nstrictly secret, the two emperors agreed to conclude a peace with England\r\non condition only that that country should acknowledge Moldavia and\r\nWallachia as a part of the Russian Empire. Then follow several articles\r\non the cession of those Turkish provinces. In the eleventh article it\r\nis stated, that further negotiations were to be carried on respecting a\r\nfurther partition. It was agreed, too, that the treaty was to be kept\r\nsecret for ten years. Buturlin boasts, with reason, that the emperor\r\nAlexander in Erfurt, by his Greco-Slavonian arts of deception, gained a\r\nvictory over the Italo-Gallic talents of Napoleon; and, in fact, the very\r\nhighest triumph is to outwit the deceiver.\r\n\r\nEven as early as this Napoleon is said to have thrown out the idea of a\r\nmarriage with Catherine Pavlovna, Alexander’s sister, which inferred,\r\nof course, a previous separation from the empress Josephine. Alexander,\r\non his part, is said to have raised difficulties on the question of\r\nreligion, and to have referred the matter to his mother, who very\r\nspeedily had the princess betrothed to Duke Peter of Oldenburg. Moreover,\r\nthe reception of the duke of Oldenburg into the confederation of the\r\nRhine was one of the results of the meeting in Erfurt.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [1809-1810 A.D.]]\r\n\r\nThe war which broke out in April, 1809, between France and Austria, put\r\nthe sincerity of the Russo-French alliance to a practical test. Russia\r\ncomplied with the letter of her engagements to the one belligerent power\r\nby declaring war against the other; but Prince Galitzin, who was to have\r\nmade a powerful diversion in Galicia, came so late into the field and\r\nhis movements were so dilatory that it was evident he had no desire to\r\ncontribute to the success of his sovereign’s ally. There was no longer\r\nany show of cordiality in the diplomatic intercourse between France\r\nand Russia; but both parties found it convenient for the present to\r\ndissemble their mutual alienation. By the Treaty of Schönbrunn, signed\r\nby vanquished Austria (October 14th, 1809), that power ceded, partly to\r\nFrance and partly to the confederation of the Rhine, several towns in\r\nGermany and Italy, with their dependencies; she was despoiled, in favour\r\nof the duchy of Warsaw, of all western Galicia and the city of Cracow;\r\nand surrendered to Russia a territory whose population was estimated at\r\n400,000 souls. The emperor of Austria, moreover, recognised the rights\r\nwhich Napoleon arrogated over the monarchies of the south of Europe,\r\nadhered to his continental system, and renounced all the countries\r\ncomprised under the name of the Illyrian Provinces. But the house of\r\nHabsburg, true to the adage, _Tu, felix Austria, nube_, retrieved its\r\nfortunes at the expense of its pride, by bestowing a daughter in marriage\r\non the conqueror.\r\n\r\n\r\nRENEWED WAR WITH TURKEY (1810 A.D.)\r\n\r\nImmediately after Alexander’s return from Erfurt orders were given to\r\nopen negotiations with the Turks. The conference took place at Jassy;\r\nbut it was immediately broken off after the Russian plenipotentiaries\r\nhad demanded, as preliminary conditions, the cession of Moldavia and\r\nWallachia, and the expulsion of the British minister from Constantinople.\r\nHostilities were then resumed. The Russians were commanded by Prince\r\nProsorovski, and after his death by Prince Bagration. With the exception\r\nof Giurgevo, all the fortresses attacked by them fell into their hands,\r\nuntil they encountered the army of the grand vizir, near Silistria, and\r\nbeing defeated with a loss of ten thousand men (September 26th), were\r\ncompelled to evacuate Bulgaria. The grand vizir, without taking advantage\r\nof his victory, retired to winter quarters.\r\n\r\nIn May, 1810, the Russian main army, under Kamenskoi, again crossed the\r\nDanube at Hirsova, passed through the Dobrudja, and marched straight\r\nagainst the Turkish main army to Shumla and Varna. At the same time, the\r\ncorps of Generals Langeron and Sacken proceeded to blockade Silistria\r\nand Rustchuk. The Turks could nowhere keep the field. At Kavarna they\r\nwere routed; at the storming of Bazardjik they lost ten thousand men; at\r\nthe storming of Rasgrad three thousand. Silistria was reduced in seven\r\ndays by Langeron. So far everything was favourable for the Russians. If\r\nthey had added to their advantages the conquest of Rustchuk, the passes\r\nof Tirnova and of Sophia towards Adrianople would have been open, the\r\nfortress of Shumla would have been avoided, and the main army of the\r\nenemy would have been manœuvred out of it. The taking of Rustchuk, and\r\nabove all the sparing of the troops, was consequently the next problem\r\nfor General Kamenskoi. Instead of doing this, the Russians attempted to\r\nstorm almost simultaneously the fortifications of Varna, Shumla, and\r\nRustchuk, were repulsed from these three places, the defence of which\r\nwas conducted by English officers, and suffered so enormously, that\r\nthe Turks felt themselves strong enough to come out from behind their\r\nintrenchments, and attack the Russian camp before Shumla. They failed,\r\nhowever, in their attempt to storm it.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [1810-1811 A.D.]]\r\n\r\nTo relieve Rustchuk, the grand vizir sent Mukhtar Pasha with picked\r\ntroops, by way of Tirnova, to the Danube. But if the Turks with their\r\nunited forces were too weak to force the Russians to abandon the\r\nintrenchments before Shumla, they could certainly not expect with a part\r\nof their army to rout the enemy near Rustchuk, where he stood with his\r\nunited forces between their separate wings. Only in case Mukhtar Pasha,\r\nwho had increased his forces to forty thousand men, entered Wallachia at\r\nTurna, and marched against Giurgevo, could the offensive have a meaning,\r\nor any influence, upon the siege of Rustchuk, because here it met with\r\nthe weak point of the enemy. But to enter upon the offensive with an\r\narmy in Wallachia, whilst the Russians stood before the fortresses of\r\nthe Danube in Bulgaria, never came into the heads of the Turks. Mukhtar\r\nPasha intrenched himself at the mouth of the Yantra to cover the passes\r\nof Tirnova and Sophia. On the 7th of September he was attacked in front,\r\nflank, and rear, held out with his best troops till the next morning,\r\nand then surrendered with five thousand men, and all his artillery.\r\nAfter this Sistovo and Cladova capitulated, and on the 27th of September\r\nRustchuk and Giurgevo surrendered.\r\n\r\nThe road to Adrianople was now open for the Russians, but their enormous\r\nlosses, caused by their own folly, would have prevented their assuming\r\nthe offensive beyond the Balkan for this year, even if the season had\r\nnot been so far advanced. Reinforcements for the next year could not be\r\nexpected, as Napoleon was preparing to attack Russia, and therefore they\r\nbegan to negotiate. Another insurrection of the janissaries interrupted\r\nthese negotiations, but did not induce the grand vizir to profit by this\r\nopportunity, and fall with his whole force upon the Russians, who, at\r\nthis time, were scattered over the country from Widdin to Sophia and\r\nthence as far as Varna. Not until Czerni George, in February, 1811, had\r\nplaced the principality of Servia under the protection of Russia, did\r\nthe grand vizir awake from his apathy in Thrace, and cross the Balkan,\r\nwith only fifteen thousand men. He, however, proceeded so slowly that\r\nKamenskoi had time enough to assemble sufficient forces.\r\n\r\nThey met at Lofteh on the Osma; the Turks were defeated, and lost three\r\nthousand men. Achmed Pasha, however, a violent and sturdy soldier,\r\nwithout any higher military education, led fifty thousand fresh troops to\r\nShumla, and insisted upon their taking the offensive. The Russians had\r\nreceived no reinforcements, but Kutusov had taken the command. Without\r\nany considerable losses, he concentrated his small army at Silistria\r\nand Rustchuk, and abandoned Bulgaria as far as the latter place, after\r\nhaving rased the fortresses. In the battle before Rustchuk, on the 4th of\r\nJuly, the Turks were driven back, but on the 7th, they forced the twenty\r\nthousand Russians who stood on the right bank of the Danube to give up\r\nRustchuk also, though not until its works had been rased.\r\n\r\nInstead of crossing the river from the Dobrudja, and operating with a\r\nsuperior force upon the Russian lines of communication, the grand vizir\r\nallowed himself to be induced, by the retreat of Kutusov, to cross the\r\nDanube at Rustchuk, without a fortress in his rear. Arrived on the\r\nleft bank with his main army, a Russian flotilla barred his retreat,\r\nwhile Russian corps recrossed the Danube above and below Rustchuk, and\r\ntook possession of the town (no longer fortified) and of the Turkish\r\ncamp (September 7th). The grand vizir fled, but his main army, still\r\nconsisting of 25,000 men and 56 pieces of artillery, was forced to\r\nsurrender in the vicinity of Giurgevo. A few days afterwards Count St.\r\nPriest took Shirtov, with the whole of the Turkish flotilla on the\r\nDanube. Nicopoli and Widdin next surrendered, so that by the end of the\r\ncampaign the Russians were masters of the whole right bank of the Danube.\r\nThe Servians, also, aided by a body of Russians, had wrested from the\r\nTurks the last fortresses they held in the principality.\r\n\r\nThe grand vizir asked for a suspension of arms, with a view to\r\nnegotiating a peace; but the terms now demanded by the victorious\r\nRussians were such as the Porte would not accede to. The war was\r\ncontinued in 1811, but always to the disadvantage of the Turks. Resolved\r\non a last desperate effort, they assembled a formidable army whilst the\r\nconference at Bucharest was still pending. At last, the rupture between\r\nFrance and Russia changed the aspect of affairs, and compelled the\r\nlatter power to abandon the long-coveted prey when it was already in its\r\ngrasp. The Russian minister, Italinski, contented himself with requiring\r\nthat the Pruth should for the future form the boundary between the two\r\nempires. The sultan regarded even this concession as disgraceful; but the\r\nRussians carried their point by bribery, and the Treaty of Bucharest was\r\nconcluded. Its chief provisions were these:\r\n\r\nArticle 4. The Pruth, from the point where it enters Moldavia to its\r\nconfluence with the Danube, and thence the left bank of the latter to its\r\nembouchure on the Black Sea at Kilia, shall be the boundary between the\r\ntwo empires. Thus the Porte surrendered to Russia a third of Moldavia,\r\nwith the fortresses of Khoczim and Bender, and all Bessarabia, with\r\nIsmail and Kilia. By the same article, the navigation of the Danube is\r\ncommon to the subjects of Russia and Turkey. The islands enclosed between\r\nthe several arms of the river below Ismail are to remain waste. The\r\nrest of Moldavia and Wallachia are to be restored to the Turks in their\r\nactual condition. Article 6. The Asiatic frontier remains the same as\r\nit was before the war. Article 8 relates to the Servians, to whom the\r\nPorte grants an amnesty and some privileges, the interpretation of which\r\noffers a wide field for the exercise of diplomatic subtlety. Article 13.\r\nRussia accepts the mediation of the Porte for the conclusion of a peace\r\nwith Persia, where hostilities had begun anew, at the instigation of the\r\nEnglish ambassador.\r\n\r\n\r\nWAR WITH NAPOLEON\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding all the demonstrations to the contrary made since the\r\nPeace of Tilsit, England, Russia, Prussia, and also Austria partially,\r\nalways continued to maintain a certain mutual understanding, which was,\r\nhowever, kept very secret, and somewhat resembled a conspiracy. The most\r\ndistinguished statesmen both in Russia and Prussia felt how unnatural\r\nwas an alliance between Napoleon, Alexander, and Frederick William III,\r\nand directed attention to the subject. This was also done on the part of\r\nEngland, and it is certain that the emperor Alexander, as early as the\r\nmeeting in Erfurt in 1808, expressed his doubts respecting the duration\r\nof his alliance with France. The conduct of Russia in the campaign\r\nagainst Austria, in 1809, first shook Napoleon’s confidence in his ally.\r\nMutual complaints and recriminations ensued; but neither party thought it\r\nadvisable to give any prominence to their disunion, and Napoleon, even\r\nwhen he had entered, through Thugut, upon the subject of an Austrian\r\nmarriage, still continued to carry on negotiations for an alliance with a\r\nRussian princess.\r\n\r\nThe enlargement of the territory of the duchy of Warsaw, extorted by\r\nNapoleon at the Peace of Schönbrunn, at length led to an exchange of\r\ndiplomatic notes, which tended strongly to a war. The Poles naturally\r\nexpected from Napoleon and his advisers that he would in some way give\r\nnew life and currency to the name of Poland; against this the emperor of\r\nRussia earnestly protested. The whole of the diplomatic correspondence\r\nbetween Russia and France in the years 1810 and 1811 turns upon the use\r\nof the words Poles and Polish, although Russia had again obtained by the\r\nPeace of Schönbrunn a portion of Austrian Poland, as it had previously\r\nobtained a part of Prussian Poland by the Peace of Tilsit. Seeing that\r\nthe whole of western Galicia, Zamoisk, and Cracow had been united to\r\nthe duchy of Warsaw by the Peace of Schönbrunn, Russia called upon the\r\nemperor of the French to bind himself expressly by treaty not to revive\r\nthe names of Pole and kingdom of Poland.\r\n\r\nBefore the end of 1809 many notes were exchanged concerning this point,\r\napparently so insignificant, but in reality so important for the peace\r\nand safety of the Russian Empire. Napoleon agreed to give the assurance\r\nso earnestly desired by Alexander, and Caulaincourt, the French\r\nambassador in St. Petersburg, signed a regular concession of the Russian\r\ndemand in January, 1810. By the first two articles of this agreement it\r\nwas laid down that the word Poland, or Polish, was not to be used when\r\nany reference was made to the enlargement of the duchy of Warsaw. By the\r\nthird article the two emperors bound themselves not to revive or renew\r\nany of the old Polish orders. In the fifth, the emperor of the French\r\nagreed not further to enlarge the duchy of Warsaw by the addition of\r\nprovinces or cities belonging to the former state of Poland.\r\n\r\nThis agreement, signed by Caulaincourt, still required the confirmation\r\nof the emperor of the French: and Napoleon had given instructions to his\r\nambassador only to agree to such an arrangement on condition that the\r\nagreement was drawn up in the usual diplomatic manner: that is to say, in\r\nemploying words and phrases so chosen as to be capable of any subsequent\r\ninterpretation which may best suit the parties. This was not done. The\r\narticles were very brief, the language so clear and definite as to be\r\nincapable of mistake or misrepresentation. Without directly refusing his\r\nsanction to the treaty, Napoleon required that it should be couched in\r\ndifferent language, and caused a new draft of it to be presented in St.\r\nPetersburg. The Russians saw at once through his purpose, and Alexander\r\nexpressed his displeasure in terms which plainly indicated to the French\r\nambassador his belief that Napoleon was really meditating some hostile\r\nmeasures against him, and was only seeking to gain time by the treaty.\r\n\r\nThis occurred in February, 1810; in the following months both Romanzov\r\nand Caulaincourt took the greatest possible pains to bring the question\r\nto a favourable issue, and negotiations continued to be carried on\r\nrespecting this subject till September. They could not agree; and\r\nafter September there was no more talk of the treaty, much less of\r\nits alteration. The relation between the two emperors had undergone a\r\ncomplete change in the course of the year.\r\n\r\nThe cupidity of Russia, far from being glutted by the possession of\r\nFinland, great part of Prussian and Austrian Poland, Moldavia, and\r\nBessarabia, still craved for more. Napoleon was, however, little inclined\r\nto concede Constantinople and the Mediterranean to his Russian ally\r\n(to whose empire he assigned the Danube as a boundary), or to put it\r\nin possession of the duchy of Warsaw. The Austrian marriage, which was\r\neffected in 1809, naturally led Russia to conclude that she would no\r\nlonger be permitted to aggrandise herself at the expense of Austria, and\r\nAlexander, seeing that nothing more was to be gained by complaisance to\r\nFrance, consequently assumed a threatening posture, and condescended to\r\nlisten to the complaints of his agricultural and mercantile subjects. No\r\nRussian vessel durst venture out to sea, and a Russian fleet had been\r\nseized by the British in the harbours of Lisbon. At Riga lay immense\r\nstores of grain in want of a foreign market. On the 31st of December,\r\n1810, Alexander published a fresh tariff permitting the importation of\r\ncolonial products under a neutral flag (several hundred English ships\r\narrived under the American flag), and prohibiting the importation of\r\nFrench manufactured goods. Not many weeks previously, on the 13th of\r\nDecember, Napoleon had annexed Oldenberg to France. The duke, Peter, was\r\nnearly related to the emperor of Russia, and Napoleon, notwithstanding\r\nhis declared readiness to grant a compensation, refused to allow it to\r\nconsist of the grand-duchy of Warsaw, and proposed a duchy of Erfurt, as\r\nyet uncreated, which Russia scornfully rejected.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [1811-1812 A.D.]]\r\n\r\nThe alliance between Russia, Sweden, and England was now speedily\r\nconcluded. Sweden, which had vainly demanded from Napoleon the possession\r\nof Norway and a large supply of money, assumed a tone of indignation,\r\nthrew open her harbours to the British merchantmen, and so openly carried\r\non a contraband trade in Pomerania, that Napoleon, in order to maintain\r\nthe continental system, was constrained to garrison Swedish Pomerania\r\nand Rügen and to disarm the Swedish inhabitants. Bernadotte, upon this,\r\nranged himself entirely on the side of his opponents, without, however,\r\ncoming to an open rupture, for which he awaited a declaration on the part\r\nof Russia. The expressions made use of by Napoleon on the birth of the\r\nking of Rome at length filled up the measure of provocation. Intoxicated\r\nwith success, he boasted, in an address to the mercantile classes, that\r\nhe would, in despite of Russia, maintain the continental system, for he\r\nwas lord over the whole of continental Europe; and that if Alexander had\r\nnot concluded a treaty with him at Tilsit, he would have compelled him\r\nto do so at St. Petersburg. The pride of the haughty Russian was deeply\r\nwounded, and a rupture was nigh at hand.\r\n\r\nRussia had, meanwhile, anticipated Napoleon in making preparations for\r\nwar. As early as 1811, a great Russian army stood ready for the invasion\r\nof Poland, and might, as there were at that time but few French troops in\r\nGermany, easily have advanced as far as the Elbe. It remained, however,\r\nin a state of inactivity. Napoleon instantly prepared for war and\r\nfortified Dantzic. His continual proposals of peace, ever unsatisfactory\r\nto the ambition of the czar, remaining at length unanswered, he declared\r\nwar.[k]\r\n\r\nBut, to get within reach of Russia, it was necessary for Napoleon to pass\r\nbeyond Austria, to cross Prussia, and to conciliate Sweden and Turkey; an\r\noffensive alliance with these four powers was therefore indispensable.\r\nAustria was subject to the ascendency of Napoleon, and Prussia to his\r\narms: to them, therefore, he had only to declare his intentions; Austria\r\nvoluntarily and eagerly entered into his plans, and Prussia he easily\r\nprevailed on to join him.\r\n\r\nAustria, however, did not act blindly. Situated between the two giant\r\npowers of the north and the west, she was not displeased to see them\r\nat war: she looked to their mutually weakening each other, and to the\r\nincrease of her own strength by their exhaustion. On the 14th of March,\r\n1812, she promised France thirty thousand men, but she prepared prudent\r\nsecret instructions for them. She obtained a vague promise of an increase\r\nof territory as an indemnity for her share of the expenses of the war,\r\nand the possession of Galicia was guaranteed to her. She admitted,\r\nhowever, the future possibility of a cession of part of that province\r\nto the kingdom of Poland, but in exchange for that she would have\r\nreceived the Illyrian Provinces. The sixth article of the secret treaty\r\nestablishes this fact.\r\n\r\nThe success of the war, therefore, in no degree depended on the cession\r\nof Galicia, or the difficulties arising from the Austrian jealousy\r\nrespecting that possession. Napoleon consequently might, on his entrance\r\ninto Vilna, have publicly proclaimed the liberation of the whole of\r\nPoland, instead of betraying the expectations of her people, confounding\r\nand rendering them indifferent by expressions of doubtful import. This\r\nwas one of those decisive issues which occur in politics as well as in\r\nwar, and which determine the future. No consideration ought to have made\r\nNapoleon swerve from his purpose. But whether it was that he reckoned\r\ntoo much on the ascendency of his genius, or the strength of his army\r\nand the weakness of Alexander; or that, considering what he left behind\r\nhim, he felt it too dangerous to carry on so distant a war slowly and\r\nmethodically; or whether, as we shall presently be told by himself, he\r\nhad doubts of the success of his undertaking, certain it is that he\r\neither neglected or could not yet venture to proclaim the liberation of\r\nthat country whose freedom he had come to restore. Yet he had sent an\r\nambassador to her diet; and when this inconsistency was remarked to him\r\nhe replied that that nomination was an act of war, which only bound him\r\nduring the war, while by his words he would be bound both in war and\r\npeace. Thus it was that he made no other answer to the enthusiasm of the\r\nLithuanians than evasive expressions, at the very time he was following\r\nup his attack on Alexander to the very capital of his empire.\r\n\r\nHe even neglected to clear the southern Polish provinces of the feeble\r\nhostile armies which kept the patriotism of their inhabitants in check,\r\nand to secure, by strongly organising their insurrection, a solid basis\r\nof operation. Accustomed to short methods and to rapid attacks, he wished\r\nto do as he had done before, in spite of the difference of places and\r\ncircumstances; for such is the weakness of man that he is always led\r\nby imitation, either of others or of himself, which in the latter case\r\nis habit, for habit is nothing more than the imitation of one’s self.\r\nAccordingly, it is by their strongest side that great men are often\r\nundone![h]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Napoleon Invades Russia (1812 A.D.)_\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [1812 A.D.]]\r\n\r\nOn the 24th of June, 1812, Napoleon crossed the Niemen, the Russian\r\nfrontier, not far from Kovno. The season was already too far advanced. It\r\nmay be that, deceived by the mildness of the winter of 1806 to 1807, he\r\nimagined it possible to protract the campaign without peril to himself\r\nuntil the winter months. No enemy appeared to oppose his progress.\r\nBarclay de Tolly, the Russian commander-in-chief, pursued the system\r\nfollowed by the Scythians against Dairus, and perpetually retiring before\r\nthe enemy gradually drew him deep into the dreary and deserted steppes.\r\nThis plan originated with Scharnhorst, by whom General Lieven was\r\nadvised not to hazard an engagement until the winter, and to turn a deaf\r\near to every proposal of peace. General Lieven, on reaching Barclay’s\r\nheadquarters, took into his confidence Colonel Toll, a German, Barclay’s\r\nright hand, and Lieutenant-Colonel Clausewitz, also a German, afterwards\r\nnoted for his strategical works.\r\n\r\nGeneral Pfül, another German, at that time high in the emperor’s\r\nconfidence, and almost all the Russian generals opposed Scharnhorst’s\r\nplan, and continued to advance with a view of giving battle: but on\r\nNapoleon’s appearance at the head of an army greatly their superior in\r\nnumber, before the Russians had been able to concentrate their forces,\r\nthey were naturally compelled to retire before him; and, on the\r\nprevention, for some weeks, of the junction of a newly levied Russian\r\narmy under Prince Bagration with the forces under Barclay, owing to the\r\nrapidity of Napoleon’s advance, Scharnhorst’s plan was adopted as the\r\nonly one feasible.\r\n\r\nWhilst the French were advancing, a warm and tedious discussion was\r\ncarried on so long in the imperial Russian council of war at Vilna,\r\nwhether to defend that city, or adopt the plan of Barclay de Tolly, the\r\nminister of war and commander-in-chief, that they were at length obliged\r\nto march precipitately to the Dvina with the sacrifice of considerable\r\nstores, and to take possession of a fortified camp which had been\r\nestablished at Drissa. As late as the 27th the emperor Alexander and the\r\nwhole of his splendid staff and court were assembled at a ball, at the\r\ncastle of Zacrest, near Vilna, belonging to General Bennigsen, so that\r\nthe French found everything on the 28th just as it had been prepared for\r\nthe reception of the emperor of Russia. They plundered the castle, and\r\ncarried off the furniture as booty; the Russians were even obliged to\r\nleave behind them considerable quantities of ammunition and provisions.\r\n\r\nIn this way the line of the Russian defences was broken through; and\r\neven a portion of their army under Platov and Bagration would have been\r\ncut off, had the king of Westphalia obeyed the commands of his brother\r\nwith the necessary rapidity. The difficulties of carrying on war in such\r\nan inhospitable country as Lithuania and Russia became apparent even at\r\nVilna; the carriages and wagons fell behind, the cannon were obliged\r\nto be left, discipline became relaxed, above ten thousand horses had\r\nalready fallen, and their carcases poisoned the air. General Balakov\r\ncould scarcely be considered serious in the proposals which he then made\r\nfor peace in the name of the emperor of Russia, because the Russians\r\nrequired as a preliminary to all negotiation that the French army should\r\nfirst retire behind the Niemen. The mission of a general, who had been\r\nminister of police, and had therefore had great experience in obtaining\r\ninformation, had no doubt a very different object in view from that of\r\nmaking peace at such a moment.\r\n\r\nNapoleon, in the hope of overtaking the Russians, and of compelling them\r\nto give battle, pushed onwards by forced marches; the supplies were\r\nunable to follow, and numbers of the men and horses sank from exhaustion,\r\nowing to over-fatigue, heat, and hunger. On the arrival of Napoleon in\r\nWitepsk, of Schwarzenberg in Volhinia, of the Prussians before Riga, the\r\narmy might have halted, reconquered Poland, have been organised, the\r\nmen put into winter quarters, the army have again taken the field early\r\nin the spring, and the conquest of Russia have been slowly but surely\r\ncompleted. But Napoleon had resolved upon terminating the war in one\r\nrapid campaign, upon defeating the Russians, seizing their metropolis,\r\nand dictating terms of peace. He incessantly pursued his retreating\r\nopponent, whose footsteps were marked by the flames of the cities and\r\nvillages and by the devastated country to their rear. The first serious\r\nopposition was made at Smolensk, whence the Russians, however, speedily\r\nretreated after setting the city on fire. On the same day, the Bavarians,\r\nwho had diverged to one side during their advance, had a furious\r\nencounter at Polotsk with a body of Russian troops under Wittgenstein.\r\nThe Bavarians remained stationary in this part of the country for the\r\npurpose of watching the movements of that general, whilst Napoleon,\r\ncareless of the peril with which he was threatened by the approach of\r\nwinter and by the multitude of enemies gathered to his rear, advanced\r\nwith the main body of the grand army from Smolensk across the wasted\r\ncountry upon Moscow, the ancient metropolis of the Russian empire.\r\n\r\nRussia, at that time engaged in a war with Turkey, whose frontiers were\r\nwatched by an immense army under Kutusov, used her utmost efforts, in\r\nwhich she was aided by England, to conciliate the Porte in order to turn\r\nthe whole of her forces against Napoleon. By a master-stroke of political\r\nintrigue, the Porte was made to conclude a disadvantageous peace at\r\nBucharest on the 28th of May, as we have already related. A Russian army\r\nunder Tchitchakov was now enabled to drive the Austrians out of Volhinia,\r\nwhilst a considerable force under Kutusov joined Barclay. Buturlin, the\r\nRussian historian of the war, states that the national troops opposed\r\nto the invaders numbered 217,000 in the first line, and 35,000 in the\r\nsecond. Chambray, whose details are very minute, after deducting the men\r\nin hospital, gives the number of those present under arms as 235,000 of\r\nthe regular army, without reckoning the garrisons of Riga, etc. This\r\ncomputation exceeds that of Buturlin, under the same circumstances, by\r\n17,000. M. de Fezensac allows 230,000 for the total of the two armies of\r\nBarclay de Tolly and Bagration, but adds the army of Tormassov on their\r\nextreme left, 68,000, and that defending Courland, on the extreme right,\r\n34,000, to make up the Russian total of 330,000 men.\r\n\r\nHad the Russians at this time hazarded an engagement, their defeat was\r\ncertain. Moscow could not have been saved. Barclay consequently resolved\r\nnot to come to an engagement, but to husband his forces and to attack\r\nthe French during the winter. The intended surrender of Moscow without a\r\nblow was, nevertheless, deeply resented as a national disgrace; the army\r\nand the people raised a clamour. Kutuzov, though immeasurably inferior\r\nto Barclay, was nominated commander-in-chief, took up a position on the\r\nlittle river Moskva near Borodino, about two days’ journey from Moscow.\r\nA bloody engagement took place there on the 7th of September, in which\r\nNapoleon, in order to spare his guards, neglected to follow up his\r\nadvantage with his usual energy, and allowed the defeated Russians, whom\r\nhe might have totally annihilated, to escape. Napoleon triumphed; but at\r\nwhat a price!--after a fearful struggle, in which he lost forty thousand\r\nmen in killed and wounded, the latter of whom perished, almost to a man,\r\nowing to want and neglect.[k]\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Abandonment of Moscow_\r\n\r\nOn his birthday, which was the 30th of August (11th of September of the\r\nRussian calendar), the emperor Alexander received a report from Prince\r\nKontonzov of the battle that had taken place at Borodino on the 26th of\r\nAugust, and which as the commander-in-chief wrote, “had terminated by the\r\nenemy not gaining a single step of territory in spite of their superior\r\nforces.” To this Kutuzov added that after having spent the night on the\r\nfield of battle, he had, in view of the enormous losses sustained by the\r\narmy, retreated to Mozhaisk. The losses on either side amounted to forty\r\nthousand men. As Ermolov very justly expressed it, “the French army was\r\ndashed to pieces against the Russian.” Although the emperor Alexander\r\nwas not led into any error as to the real signification of the battle\r\nof Borodino, yet wishing to maintain the hopes of the nation as to the\r\nsuccessful termination of the struggle with Napoleon and their confidence\r\nin Kutuzov, he accepted the report of the conflict of the 26th of August\r\nas the announcement of a victory. Prince Kutuzov was created general\r\nfield-marshal and granted a sum of 100,000 rubles. Barclay de Tolly\r\nwas rewarded with the order of St. George of the second class, and the\r\nmortally wounded Prince Bagration with a sum of 50,000 rubles. Fourteen\r\ngenerals received the order of St. George of the third class, and all\r\nthe privates who had taken part in the battle were given five rubles each.\r\n\r\nPrince Kutuzov’s despatch of the 27th of August to the emperor Alexander\r\nwas read by Prince Gortchakov at the Nevski monastery before a\r\nthanksgiving service which took place in the presence of their majesties,\r\nand was printed in the _Northern Post_. But the following lines were\r\nomitted from the report: “Your imperial majesty will deign to agree that\r\nafter a most sanguinary battle, which lasted fifteen hours, our army and\r\nthat of the enemy could not fail to be in disorder. Moreover, through the\r\nlosses sustained this day the position has naturally become incompatible\r\nwith the depleted number of our troops--therefore, all our aims being\r\ndirected to the destruction of the French army, I have come to the\r\ndecision to fall back six versts, that is, beyond Mozhaisk.”\r\n\r\nA moment of anxious expectation approached in St. Petersburg. Meanwhile\r\nKutuzov, retreating step by step, led the army to Moscow, and on the 1st\r\nof September he assembled a council of war at the village of Filiakh.\r\nThere was decided the fate of the first capital of the empire. After\r\nprolonged debates Kutuzov concluded the conference by saying: “I know\r\nthat I shall have to pay the damage, but I sacrifice myself for the good\r\nof my country. I give the order to retreat.”\r\n\r\nIt was already towards nightfall when Rostoptchin received the following\r\nletter from Kutuzov: “The fact that the enemy has divided his columns\r\nupon Zvenigorod and Borovsk, together with the disadvantageous position\r\nnow occupied by our troops, oblige me to my sorrow to abandon Moscow. The\r\narmy is marching on the route to Riazan.” It was thus that Rostoptchin\r\nreceived the first definite information of Kutuzov’s intention to leave\r\nMoscow a few hours before the French were in sight of the capital; under\r\nthese circumstances the Moscow commander-in-chief did all that was\r\npossible on his side and took all measures for setting the town on fire\r\nat the approach of the army. Rostoptchin departed unhindered in a droshky\r\nby the back gates.\r\n\r\nWhen on the 2nd of September Napoleon reached the Dragomilovski barriers,\r\nhe expected to find there a deputation, begging that the city might be\r\nspared; but instead of that he received the news that Moscow had been\r\nabandoned by its inhabitants. “Moscow deserted! What an improbable event!\r\nWe must make sure of it. Go and bring the boyars to me,” said he to Count\r\nDarn, whom he sent into the town. Instead of the boyars a few foreigners\r\nwere collected who confirmed the news that Moscow had been abandoned by\r\nnearly all its inhabitants. Having passed the night on the outskirts of\r\nthe city, on the morning of the 3rd of September Napoleon transferred his\r\nheadquarters to the Kremlin. But here a still more unexpected occurrence\r\nawaited him. The fires, which had already commenced the eve, had not\r\nceased burning; and on the night between the 3rd and the 4th of September\r\nthe flames, driven along by a strong wind, had enveloped the greater\r\npart of the town. At midday the flames reached the Kremlin, and Napoleon\r\nwas forced to seek a refuge in the Petrovski palace, where he remained\r\nuntil the 6th of September, when the fire began to abate.[56] Nine tenths\r\nof the city became the prey of the flames, and pillage completed the\r\ncalamities that overtook the inhabitants who had remained in it.\r\n\r\nIt was only on the 7th of September that the emperor Alexander received\r\nthrough Iaroslav a short despatch from Count Rostoptchin to the effect\r\nthat Kutuzov had decided to abandon Moscow. The next day, the 8th of\r\nSeptember, the fatal news of Napoleon’s occupation of the capital of the\r\nempire was confirmed by a despatch from the field-marshal dated the 4th\r\nof September and brought in by Colonel Michaud. Kutuzov wrote from the\r\nvillage of Jilin (on the march to the Borovsk bridge) as follows:\r\n\r\n“After the battle of the 26th of August, which in spite of so much\r\nbloodshed resulted in a victory for our side, I was obliged to abandon\r\nthe position near Borodino for reasons of which I had the honour to\r\ninform your imperial majesty. The army was completely exhausted after the\r\ncombat. In this condition we drew nearer to Moscow, having daily greatly\r\nto do with the advance guard of the enemy; besides this there was no near\r\nprospect of a position presenting itself from which I could successfully\r\nengage the enemy. The troops which we had hoped to join could not yet\r\ncome; the enemy had set two fresh columns, one upon the Borovsk route\r\nand the other on the Zvenigorod route, striving to act upon my rear from\r\nMoscow: therefore I could not venture to risk a battle, the disadvantages\r\nof which might have as consequences not only the destruction of the army\r\nbut the most sanguinary losses and the conversion of Moscow itself to\r\nashes.\r\n\r\n“In this most uncertain position, after taking counsel with our first\r\ngenerals, of whom some were of contrary opinion, I was forced to\r\ndecide to allow the enemy to enter Moscow, whence all the treasures,\r\nthe arsenal, and nearly all property belonging to the state or private\r\nindividuals had been removed, and in which hardly a single inhabitant\r\nremained. I venture most humbly to submit to your most gracious majesty\r\nthat the entry of the enemy into Moscow is not the subjection of Russia.\r\nOn the contrary, I am now moving with the army on the route to Tula,\r\nwhich will place me in a position to avail myself of the help abundantly\r\nprepared in our governments. Although I do not deny that the occupation\r\nof the capital is a most painful wound, yet I could not waver in my\r\ndecision.\r\n\r\n“I am now entering upon operations with all the strength of the line, by\r\nmeans of which, beginning with the Tula and Kaluga routes, my detachments\r\nwill cut off the whole line of the enemy, stretching from Smolensk to\r\nMoscow, and thus avert any assistance which the enemy’s army might\r\npossibly receive from its rear; by turning the attention of the enemy\r\nupon us, I hope to force him to leave Moscow and change the whole line of\r\nhis operations. I have enjoined General Vinzengerode to hold himself on\r\nthe Tver route, having meanwhile a regiment of Cossacks on the Iaroslav\r\nroute in order to protect the inhabitants against attacks from the\r\nenemy’s detachments. Having now assembled my forces at no great distance\r\nfrom Moscow I can await the enemy with a firm front, and as long as the\r\narmy of your imperial majesty is whole and animated by its known bravery\r\nand our zeal, the yet retrievable loss of Moscow cannot be regarded\r\nas the loss of the fatherland. Besides this, your imperial majesty\r\nwill graciously deign to agree that these consequences are indivisibly\r\nconnected with the loss of Smolensk and with the condition of complete\r\ndisorder in which I found the troops.”\r\n\r\nThis despatch from Prince Kutuzov was printed in the _Northern Post_ of\r\nthe 18th of September, with the exception of the concluding words of the\r\nreport: “and with the condition of complete disorder in which I found the\r\ntroops.” The sorrowful news brought by Colonel Michaud did not, however,\r\nshake the emperor Alexander in his decision to continue the war and not\r\nto enter into negotiations with the enemy. When he had finished listening\r\nto Michaud’s report, he turned to him with the following memorable words:\r\n“Go back to the army, and tell our brave soldiers, tell all my faithful\r\nsubjects, wherever you pass by, that even if I have not one soldier left,\r\nI will put myself at the head of my dear nobles, of my good peasants,\r\nand will thus employ the last resources of my empire; it offers more to\r\nme than my enemies think for, but if ever it were written in the decrees\r\nof divine providence that my dynasty should cease to reign upon the\r\nthrone of my ancestors, then, after having exhausted every means in my\r\npower, I would let my beard grow and go to eat potatoes with the last of\r\nmy peasants, rather than sign the shame of my country and of my beloved\r\npeople whose sacrifices I know how to prize. Napoleon or I--I or he; for\r\nhe and I can no longer reign together. I have learned to know him; he\r\nwill no longer deceive me.”\r\n\r\n“The loss of Moscow,” wrote Alexander to the crown prince of Sweden on\r\nthe 19th of September, “gives me at least the opportunity of presenting\r\nto the whole of Europe the greatest proof I can offer of my perseverance\r\nin continuing the struggle against her oppressor, for after such a wound\r\nall the rest are but scratches. Now more than ever I and the nation at\r\nthe head of which I have the honour to be, are decided to persevere. We\r\nshould rather be buried beneath the ruins of the empire than make terms\r\nwith the modern Attila.”\r\n\r\nThe letter that Napoleon addressed to the emperor from Moscow, dated\r\nthe 8th of September, in which he disclaimed the responsibility of the\r\nburning of the capital, was left unanswered. In informing the crown\r\nprince of it, the emperor Alexander added: “It contains, however, nothing\r\nbut bragging.”\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Retreat of the Grand Army_\r\n\r\nAt length the sorrowful days which the emperor Alexander had lived\r\nthrough passed by, and the hope of better things in the future manifested\r\nitself. On the 15th of October Colonel Michaud arrived in St. Petersburg\r\nfrom the army, for the second time; but on this occasion he was the\r\nbearer of the joyful intelligence of the victory of Tarontin, which had\r\ntaken place on the 6th of October. The envoy also informed the emperor of\r\nthe army’s desire that he should take the command of it in person. The\r\nemperor replied as follows:\r\n\r\n“All men are ambitious, and I frankly acknowledge that I am no less\r\nambitious than others; were I to listen to this feeling alone, I should\r\nget into a carriage with you and set off to the army. Taking into\r\nconsideration the disadvantageous position into which we have induced\r\nthe enemy, the excellent spirit by which the army is animated, the\r\ninexhaustible resources of the empire, the numerous troops in reserve,\r\nwhich I have lying in readiness, and the orders that I have despatched to\r\nthe army of Moldavia--I feel undoubtingly sure that the victory must be\r\ninalienably ours, and that it only remains for us, as you say, to gather\r\nthe laurels. I know that if I were with the army all the glory would be\r\nattributed to me, and that I should occupy a place in history; but when I\r\nthink how little experience I have in the art of war in comparison with\r\nmy adversary, and that in spite of my good will I might make a mistake,\r\nthrough which the precious blood of my children might be shed, then\r\nsetting aside my ambition, I am ready willingly to sacrifice my glory\r\nfor the good of the army. Let those gather the laurels who are worthier\r\nof them than I; go back to headquarters, congratulate Prince Michael\r\nLarionovitch with his victory, and tell him to drive the enemy out of\r\nRussia and then I will come to meet him and will lead him triumphantly\r\ninto the capital.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: RETREAT OF NAPOLEON FROM THE BURNING CITY OF MOSCOW\r\n\r\n(Painted for THE HISTORIANS’ HISTORY OF THE WORLD by Thure de Thulstrup)]\r\n\r\nAt that time the fate of the _grande armée_ was already definitively\r\ndecided. Having lost all hope of the peace he so desired, Napoleon began\r\nto prepare for retreat. The defeat of his vanguard at Tarontin on the\r\n6th of October hastened the departure of the French from Moscow; it began\r\nin the evening of the same day. Napoleon’s intention was first to move\r\nalong the old Kaluga road, to join Murat’s vanguard, and then go on to\r\nthe new Kaluga road; the emperor thus hoped to go round the Russian army\r\nand open a free access for himself to Kaluga. But the partisan Seslavin,\r\nwho had boldly made his way through on to the Borovsk route discovered\r\nNapoleon’s movements. Standing behind a tree in the road, he saw the\r\ncarriage in which was the emperor himself, surrounded by his marshals and\r\nhis guards. Not satisfied with this exploit, Seslavin besides caught a\r\nnon-commissioned officer of the Old Guard, who had got separated from the\r\nothers in the thickness of the wood, bound him, and throwing him across\r\nhis saddle, galloped off with him.\r\n\r\nThe intelligence obtained by Seslavin had for consequences the\r\nimmediate move of Dokhtorov’s corps to Malo-Iaroslavetz; at the same\r\ntime Kutuzov decided to follow from Tarontin with the whole army, and\r\nthese arrangements led, on the 12th of October, to the battle near\r\nMalo-Iaroslavetz. The town passed from the hands of one side to the\r\nother eight times, and although after a conflict of eighteen hours it\r\nwas finally given up to the French, yet Kutuzov succeeded in opportunely\r\nconcentrating the whole army to the south of it, at a distance of two and\r\none-half versts.\r\n\r\nHere, as Ségur justly remarks, was stopped the conquest of the\r\nuniverse, here vanished the fruits of twenty years of victory and\r\nbegan the destruction of all that Napoleon had hoped to create. The\r\nauthor of this success, Seslavin, writes: “The enemy was forestalled at\r\nMalo-Iaroslavetz; the French were exterminated, Russia was saved, Europe\r\nset free, and universal peace established: such are the consequences of\r\nthis great discovery.”\r\n\r\nThe field-marshal had now to decide the question whether a general\r\nbattle should be attempted for the annihilation of the French army, or\r\nwhether endeavours should be made to attain this object by more cautious\r\nmeans. The leader stopped at the latter decision. “It will all fall\r\nthrough without me,” said Kutuzov, in reply to the impatient partisans of\r\ndecisive action. He expressed his idea more definitely on this occasion\r\nto the English general Wilson, who was then at the Russian headquarters:\r\n“I prefer to build a ‘golden bridge,’ as you call it, for my adversary,\r\nthan to put myself in such a position that I might receive a ‘blow on\r\nthe neck’ from him. Besides this, I again repeat to you what I have\r\nalready several times told you--I am not at all sure that the complete\r\nannihilation of the emperor Napoleon and his army would be such a great\r\nbenefit to the universe. His inheritance would give the continent not to\r\nRussia or any other power, but to that power which now already rules the\r\nseas; and then her predominance would be unbearable.” Wilson replied: “Do\r\nwhat you ought, come what may.” The Russian army began to depart on the\r\nnight between the 13th and 14th of October for Detchina.[g]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Napoleon on the Road to Smolensk_\r\n\r\nWhen, on the 14th of October, Kutuzov and his army approached Detchina,\r\nNapoleon turned again from Gorodni in the direction of Malo-Iaroslavetz.\r\nHalf-way there, a report was brought to him which announced that the\r\nRussian outposts had quitted this latter town. Napoleon stopped, and,\r\nseating himself near a fire which had been lighted in the open: “What\r\ndesign,” he said, “had Kutuzov in abandoning Malo-Iaroslavetz?” He was\r\nsilent for a moment and then added: “He wants to stop our road to the\r\nsouth.” And, determined as he was not to fight, Napoleon ordered the\r\narmy to return along the Smolensk road, preferring to contend with want\r\nof provisions rather than find himself on the other track, under the\r\nnecessity of using force in order to pursue the direction he had intended\r\nto take when he quitted Moscow. Thus the whole plan of campaign was\r\nthwarted and the fortune of Napoleon compromised. From Malo-Iaroslavetz\r\nto Waterloo Napoleon’s career presents nothing but a series of defeats,\r\nrarely interrupted by a few victories. It was in profound silence\r\nand with dejection painted on every visage that the French army, as\r\nthough under the presentiment of its fatal destiny, retraced the way\r\nto Smolensk. Napoleon marched pensive in the midst of his downcast\r\nregiments, reckoning with Marshal Berthier the enormous distances to be\r\ntraversed and the time it must take him to reach Smolensk and Minsk, the\r\nonly towns on the Vilna road where food and ammunition had been prepared.\r\n\r\nKutuzov, learning on the 14th of October that Napoleon had left\r\nMalo-Iaroslavetz, immediately advanced his army on the Miadin road in\r\nthe direction of some linen factories, and detached Platov with fifteen\r\nCossack regiments and some flying squadrons, that they might inform him\r\nof Napoleon’s movements. The next day he received from these squadrons\r\nthe assurance that the latter was indeed effecting his retreat by the\r\nSmolensk route. Thus the manœuvres of Kutuzov were crowned with complete\r\nsuccess. Thus it happened that just two months after the 17th of August,\r\nthe day on which he had assumed command of the armies, the conqueror’s\r\neagles were flying with all speed towards the place whence they had\r\ntaken flight. The movement carried out on the enemy’s left flank as far\r\nas Malo-Iaroslavetz, and thence to the linen factories, disconcerted\r\nall Napoleon’s plans, closed to him the road to Kaluga and Iukhnov, and\r\nforced him to follow a route which two months before had been ruined\r\nfrom end to end, and which led across deserts that Napoleon seemed to\r\nhave prepared for himself. The enemy’s army, which still amounted to one\r\nhundred thousand men, continued to bear a threatening aspect, but the\r\nwant of provisions and the attacks it had to repulse must diminish its\r\nforces and hasten its disorganisation. Hunger, like a gnawing worm, was\r\nexhausting the enemy, while Russian steel completed his destruction.\r\nThe nearest French magazines were at Smolensk, eight hundred versts\r\naway. To cross this distance with the little food he possessed, to\r\nsuffer an immense loss, and, in addition, to be continually exposed to\r\nattacks--such were the exploits now before Napoleon and such was the\r\nposition in which Kutuzov had placed him.\r\n\r\nThe question was: How is Napoleon to be pursued? What direction shall the\r\narmy take in order to derive all the advantage possible from the retreat\r\nof the French? To follow the enemy’s steps in columns was impossible\r\nwithout exposing the army to the pangs of hunger. “I think,” said\r\nKutuzov, “that I shall do Napoleon most harm by marching parallel with\r\nhim and acting on the way according to the movements he may execute.”\r\nThis happy idea seemed to be a basis for the manœuvres which Kutuzov\r\nsubsequently effected. He gave orders to the army to march on Viazmabi\r\nKussov, Suleïka, Dubrova, and Bikov; to Miloradovitch to direct his way,\r\nwith two corps of infantry and two of cavalry, between the army and the\r\nroute to Smolensk, and to approach this route in the neighbourhood of\r\nGzhatsk, and then, proceeding in the direction of Viazma, along the same\r\nroad, to take advantage of every favourable opportunity of attacking\r\nthe enemy; to Platov, who had been reinforced by Paskevitch’s division,\r\nto follow the French in the rear; and finally to the guerilla corps\r\nto fall on the enemy’s columns in front and in flank. In ordering\r\nthese dispositions Kutuzov addressed the following order of the day\r\nto the army: “Napoleon, who thought only of ardently pursuing a war\r\nwhich has become national, without foreseeing that it might in one\r\nmoment annihilate his whole army, now finding in every inhabitant a\r\nsoldier ready to repulse his perfidious seductions, and seeing the firm\r\nresolution of the whole population to present, if need be, their breasts\r\nto the sword directed against their beloved country--Napoleon, in fine,\r\nafter having attained the object of his vain and foolhardy thoughts,\r\nnamely that of shaking all Russia by rendering himself master of Moscow,\r\nhas suddenly made up his mind to beat a retreat. We are at this moment in\r\npursuit of him, whilst other Russian armies occupy Lithuania anew and are\r\nready to act in concert with us to complete the ruin of the enemy who has\r\nventured to menace Russia. In his flight he abandons his caissons, blows\r\nup his projectiles, and covers the ground with the treasures carried off\r\nfrom our churches. Already Napoleon hears murmurs raised by all ranks\r\nof his army; already hunger is making itself felt, while desertion and\r\ndisorder of every kind are manifested amongst the soldiers. Already the\r\nvoice of our august monarch rings out, crying to us, ‘Extinguish the fire\r\nof Moscow in the blood of the enemy. Warriors, let us accomplish that\r\ntask, and Russia will be content with us--a solid peace will be again\r\nestablished within the circle of her immense frontiers! Brave soldiers of\r\nRussia, God will aid us in so righteous an achievement!’”\r\n\r\nImmediately, as Kutuzov had ordered, a general movement of the army began\r\nin the enemy’s rear. The French left on the road sick, wounded--all\r\nthis might delay the march of the retiring troops. The cavalry began\r\nno longer to show themselves in the rearguard. For lack of food and\r\nshoeing the horses became so enfeebled that the cavalry were outdistanced\r\nby the infantry, who continued to hasten their retreat. Speed was the\r\nenemy’s only means of escaping from the deserts in which no nourishment\r\ncould be procured, and of reaching the Dnieper, where the French\r\ncounted on finding some corn magazines, and forming a junction with\r\nthe corps of Victor and St. Cyr and the battalions on the march, the\r\nvarious columns which were there at the moment, the depots, and a great\r\nnumber of soldiers who had fallen off from the army and were following\r\nit. Convinced of the necessity of hurrying their steps, all, from the\r\nmarshals down to the meanest soldiers, went forward at full speed.\r\n\r\nBut the temperature grew daily more rigorous. The cold wind of autumn\r\nrendered bivouacs insupportable to the enemy, and drove him thence in\r\nthe morning long before daybreak. He struck camp in the darkness, and\r\nlighted his way along the road by means of lanterns. Each corps tried to\r\npass the other. The passage of the rivers, on rafts or bridges, was made\r\nin the greatest disorder, and the baggage accumulated so as to arrest\r\nthe movements of the army. The provisions which the soldiers had laid in\r\nat Moscow, and which they carried on their backs, were quickly consumed,\r\nand they began to eat horseflesh. The prices of food and of warm clothes\r\nand footgear became exorbitant. To stray from the road for the purpose of\r\nprocuring food was an impossibility, for the Cossacks who were prowling\r\nright and left killed or made prisoners all who fell into their hands.\r\nThe peasants from the villages bordering on the route, dressed in cloaks,\r\nshakos, plumed helmets, and steel cuirasses which they had taken from the\r\nFrench, often joined the Don Cossacks or Miloradovitch’s advance guard.\r\nSome were armed with scythes, others with thick, iron-shod staves, or\r\nhalberds, and a few carried firearms. They came out of the forests in\r\nwhich they had taken refuge with their families, greeted the Russian\r\narmy on its appearance, congratulated it on the flight of the enemy, and\r\nby way of farewells to the latter took a just vengeance upon it. With the\r\nenemy the fear of falling into the hands of the Cossacks and peasants\r\ntriumphed over the sense of hunger and deterred them from plundering.\r\nThe French began to throw away their arms. The first to set the example\r\nwere the regiments of light cavalry, to whom infantry muskets had been\r\ndistributed at Moscow. The regiments being mixed together, they shook\r\noff all discipline. The disarmed men were at first few in number, and as\r\nthey trailed along in the wake of the army they agglomerated them like\r\nsnowballs.\r\n\r\nThe sick and those overcome by fatigue were abandoned on the road without\r\nthe least pity. In fear of losing their flags the leaders of regiments\r\nremoved them from their staves and gave them in keeping to the strongest\r\nand most tried soldiers, who hid them in their haversacks or under their\r\nuniforms, or wrapped them round their bodies. When Napoleon had passed\r\nGzhatsk, he no longer rode on horseback in the midst of his troops, but\r\ndrove in a carriage, wrapped himself in a green velvet cloak lined with\r\nsable furs, and put on warm boots and a fur cap.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Battle of Viazma; Smolensk is Found Evacuated_\r\n\r\nThe retreat was performed so rapidly, that Miloradovitch could not begin\r\nthe pursuit of the enemy till he had arrived at Viazma. On the 22nd of\r\nOctober, he attacked the French near this town and beat them. Three guns\r\nand two flags were taken from them and two thousand of them were made\r\nprisoners. When Viazma had been passed, Kutuzov ordered Miloradovitch\r\nto follow in the enemy’s track and to press him as much as possible,\r\nand Platov to get ahead of his right, and attack it in front, as Orlov\r\nDenissov was to do on his left; the guerillas had orders to march quickly\r\non Smolensk. He exhorted the whole army to harass the French day and\r\nnight. Kutuzov with the main body proceeded on the left, on a level\r\nwith Miloradovitch, to be able to reach Orscha by the shortest road, in\r\ncase Napoleon should effect his retreat on that town; but, if he took\r\nthe direction of Mohilev, to stop his way and cover the district whence\r\nthe Russian army drew its provisions. Kutuzov was inflexible in the\r\nresolution he had taken to keep Napoleon on the Smolensk road, which was\r\nso completely wasted, and to force him to die of hunger there rather than\r\nallow him to penetrate into the southern governments, where he might\r\nhave obtained provisions. Anxious to know if Napoleon would not bear to\r\nthe left towards Ielna and Mstislavl, and thence to Mohilev, Kutuzov did\r\nnot confine himself to insisting on personally directing his army on the\r\nroad, whence he could prevent this movement, but he ordered the Kaluga\r\nmilitia, reinforced by Cossacks and some regular cavalry regiments, to\r\nadvance rapidly from Kaluga and Roslavl on Ielna; that of Tula to march\r\non Roslavl, that of Smolensk on Ielna, and that of Little Russia to do\r\nits utmost promptly to occupy Mohilev.\r\n\r\nSuch were, in outline, the directions which Kutuzov gave to the army\r\nafter the battle of Viazma, when the enemy found itself under the\r\nstern necessity of struggling with a new calamity which it had not yet\r\nexperienced--namely, severe cold. The winds raged and thick snow fell for\r\nfive days; it blinded the soldiers and lay so thick as to arrest their\r\nmarch. The French horses, not being rough-shod, fell under the guns,\r\nunder the carts, and under their riders; men were lying on the route,\r\ndead or dying, dragging themselves along like reptiles, in villages\r\nreduced to ashes and round overturned wagons and caissons which the\r\npowder had blown to pieces. Many among them were seized with madness. It\r\nwas in this state that, on the 31st of October, Napoleon led his army\r\nback to Smolensk, which he hastened to reach as the promised land, never\r\ndoubting that he would be able to halt there. The thought of wintering\r\nin Smolensk supported soldiers exhausted by fatigue and warmed those\r\novercome by the cold; each one collected his remaining strength to reach\r\nthe town where their misfortunes were to end. On catching sight of the\r\ndistant summits of Smolensk, the enemy rejoiced and forgot hunger and\r\nthirst. Arrived at the town they rushed into it by thousands, stifling\r\nand killing each other in its narrow gates, ran for the provisions they\r\nbelieved themselves sure of finding, and seeking for warm habitations;\r\nbut it was in vain; for soon like a thunderclap the news was echoed that\r\nthere was in Smolensk neither food nor refuge; that it was impossible to\r\nstay there; that they must go on. Twenty degrees of cold came to crown\r\ntheir misfortunes, but this suddenly ceased--the next day it thawed;\r\notherwise the sudden extinction of the enemy would have been inevitable.\r\n\r\nSmolensk presented a horrible spectacle. From the Moscow gate to the\r\nline of the Dnieper, the ground was strewn with corpses and dead horses.\r\nFire had turned the Moscow suburb into a desert; in it and on the snow\r\nwhich covered the ice on the Dnieper were to be seen wagons, caissons of\r\nammunition, ambulances, cannon, pontoons, muskets, pistols, bayonets,\r\ndrums, cuirasses, shakos, bearskins, musical instruments, ramrods,\r\nswords, and sabres. Amongst the corpses on the banks appeared a long file\r\nof wagons, not yet unharnessed but whose horses had fallen down and whose\r\ndrivers lay half dead in their seats. In other places horses were lying\r\nwith the entrails protruding from their bodies. Their bellies were split\r\nopen, for the soldiers had tried to warm their frozen limbs there, or to\r\nappease their hunger. Where the river banks ended, along the road which\r\nskirted the walls of the town, were seen five versts away six or more\r\nranks of caissons of ammunition and projectiles, calashes from Moscow,\r\ncarriages, droshkies, travelling forges. The French, frozen with cold,\r\nran hither and thither, wrapped in priests’ cassocks, in surplices, in\r\nwomen’s cloaks, with straw wound about their legs, and hoods, Jews’ caps,\r\nor mats on their heads; nearly all cursed Napoleon, emitted volleys\r\nof blasphemies, and, calling upon Death in their despair, bared their\r\nbreasts and fell under his inexorable scythe.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Kutuzov’s Policy_\r\n\r\nKutuzov, who had reduced Napoleon to this horrible situation, and who,\r\nby means of his flying squadrons, was kept aware of his every step, had\r\nsucceeded in hiding all his own movements. Napoleon believed, as we\r\nsee by the orders he gave his marshals, that Kutuzov was not marching\r\nparallel with the French army, but behind it; and yet Kutuzov continued\r\nhis side movement round Smolensk, daily receiving reports of defeats of\r\nthe enemy.\r\n\r\nAlready, between Moscow and Smolensk, one hundred pieces of cannon\r\nhad been taken from the French and 10,000 men made prisoners. In\r\ncongratulating the army on its successes, Kutuzov said in an order of\r\nthe day: “After the brilliant success which we obtain every day and\r\neverywhere over the enemy, it only remains for us to pursue him speedily,\r\nand perhaps the soil of that Russia which he sought to subjugate\r\nwill enclose all his bones within her breast; let us then pursue him\r\nwithout pause. Winter declares itself, the frost increases, the snow is\r\nblinding. Is it for you, children of the North, to fear all these harsh\r\ninclemencies? Your iron breasts resist them as they resist the rage of\r\nenemies. They are the ramparts, the hope of our country, against which\r\neverything is broken. If momentary privations should make themselves\r\nfelt, you will know how to support them. True soldiers are distinguished\r\nby patience and courage. The old will set an example to the young. Let\r\nall remember Suvarov; he taught us to endure hunger and cold where\r\nvictory and the honour of the Russian people were concerned. Forward,\r\nmarch! God is with us! The beaten enemy precedes us; may calm and\r\ntranquillity be restored behind us.”[i]\r\n\r\nKutuzov did not allow himself to be tempted by the disastrous position\r\nof his adversary and remained faithful to the cautious policy he had\r\nadopted, sparing as far as possible the troops entrusted to him. He never\r\nonce altered his ruling idea, and remained true to it until the very end\r\nof the campaign. To those who were in favour of more energetic measures\r\nhe replied: “Our young folks are angry with me for restraining their\r\noutbursts. They should take into consideration that circumstances will\r\ndo far more for us by themselves than our arms.” Kutuzov’s indecision\r\nat Viazma and Krasnoi, Tchitchagov’s mistakes, and Count Wittgenstein’s\r\ncaution, however, gave Napoleon’s genius the possibility of triumphing\r\nwith fresh brilliancy over the unprecedented misfortunes that pursued\r\nhim: on the 14th of November began the passage of the French across the\r\nBeresina at Stondianka, and then the pitiful remains of the _grande\r\narmée_, amounting to nine thousand men, hurriedly moved, or it would be\r\nmore correct to say fled to Vilna, closely pursued by the Russian forces.\r\nThe frost, which had reached thirty degrees, completed the destruction of\r\nthe enemy; the whole route was strewn with the bodies of those who had\r\nperished from cold and hunger. Seeing the destruction of his troops and\r\nthe necessity of creating a fresh army in order to continue the struggle,\r\nNapoleon wrote from Molodechno on the 21st of November his twenty-ninth\r\nbulletin, by which he informed Europe of the lamentable issue of the war,\r\nbegun six months previously, and after transferring the command of the\r\narmy to the king of Naples, Murat, he left Smorgoni for Paris on the 23rd\r\nof November.\r\n\r\nAs the remains of Napoleon’s army approached the frontiers of Russia,\r\nthe complicated question presented itself to the emperor Alexander as\r\nto whether the Russian forces should stop at the Vistula and complete\r\nthe triumph of Russia by a glorious peace or continue the struggle with\r\nNapoleon in order to re-establish the political independence of Germany\r\nand the exaltation of Austria. The emperor inclined to the latter\r\ndecision--that is, to the prolongation of the war; such an intention was\r\nin complete accordance with the conviction he had previously expressed:\r\n“Napoleon or I--I or he; but together we cannot reign.” At the end\r\nof the year 1812 the final object of the war was already marked out\r\nby the emperor Alexander. This is evident from his conversation with\r\nMademoiselle Sturdza not long before his departure for Vilna, in which\r\nthe sovereign shared with her his feelings of joy at the happy results of\r\nthe war. Alexander referred in their colloquy to the extraordinary man\r\nwho, blinded by fortune, had occasioned so many calamities to mankind.\r\nSpeaking of the enigmatical character of Napoleon, he called to mind\r\nhow he had studied him during the negotiations at Tilsit; in reference\r\nto this the emperor said: “The present time reminds me of all that I\r\nheard from that extraordinary man at Tilsit. Then we talked a long while\r\ntogether, for he liked to show me his superiority and lavishly displayed\r\nbefore me all the brilliancy of his imagination. ‘War,’ said he to me\r\nonce, ‘is not at all such a difficult art as people think, and to speak\r\nfrankly it is sometimes hard to explain exactly how one has succeeded in\r\nwinning a battle. In reality it would seem that he is vanquished who is\r\nafraid of his adversary and that the whole secret lies in that. There is\r\nno leader who does not dread the issue of a battle; the whole thing is to\r\nhide this fear for the longest time possible. It is only thus that he can\r\nfrighten his opponent, and then there is no doubt of ultimate success.’ I\r\nlistened,” continued the emperor, “with the deepest attention to all that\r\nhe was pleased to communicate to me on the subject, firmly resolving to\r\nprofit by it when the occasion presented itself, and in fact I hope that\r\nI have since acquired some experience in order to solve the question as\r\nto what there remains for us to do.” “Surely, Sire, we are forever secure\r\nagainst such an invasion?” replied Mademoiselle Sturdza. “Would the enemy\r\ndare again to cross our frontiers?” “It is possible,” answered Alexander,\r\n“but if a lasting and solid peace is desired it must be signed in Paris;\r\nof that I am firmly convinced.”\r\n\r\nKutuzov was of an entirely opposite opinion; he considered that Napoleon\r\nwas no longer dangerous to Russia, and that he must be spared on account\r\nof the English, who would endeavour to seize upon his inheritance to the\r\ndetriment of Russia and other continental powers. All the thoughts of the\r\nfield-marshal were directed to the salvation of the fatherland, and not\r\nthat of Europe, as those English and German patriots would have desired,\r\nwho were already accustomed to look upon Russia as a convenient tool\r\nfor the attainment and consolidation of their political aims. Kutuzov’s\r\nopinions, as might have been expected, were strongly censured by those\r\naround Alexander and in general by persons who judged of military\r\nmovements from the depths of their studies.\r\n\r\nThe frame of mind of such persons is best described in the correspondence\r\nof Baron Ampheldt, who devoted the following witty lines to this burning\r\nquestion: “Our affairs might even go still better if Kutuzov had not\r\ntaken upon himself the form of a tortoise, and Tchitchagov that of\r\na weather-cock, which does not follow any plan: the latter sins by\r\na superfluity of intellect and a want of experience, the former by\r\nexcessive caution. I suppose, however, that after his passage across the\r\nNiemen Bonaparte has not a very large company left; cold, hunger, and\r\nCossack spears must have occasioned him some difficulties. Meanwhile,\r\nas long as the man lives, we shall never be in a condition to count on\r\nany rest; and therefore war to the death is necessary. Our good emperor\r\nshares these views, in spite of the opinion of those contemptible\r\ncreatures who would have wished to stop at the Vistula. But this is not\r\nthe desire of the people, who, however, alone bear the burden of the war\r\nand in whom are to be found more healthy good sense and feeling than in\r\npowdered heads ornamented with orders and embroideries.”\r\n\r\nOn the 28th of November the Russian forces occupied Vilna, after having\r\ntaken 140 guns, more than 14,000 prisoners, and vast quantities of\r\nstores. Prince Kutuzov arrived on the 30th of November; he came to a\r\nplace with which he was already well acquainted, having formerly filled\r\nthe position of Lithuanian military governor. The population, forgetting\r\nNapoleon and their vanished dreams of the re-establishment of the kingdom\r\nof Poland, welcomed the triumphant leader with odes and speeches, and\r\non the stage of the theatre Kutuzov’s image was represented with the\r\ninscription: “The saviour of the country.”\r\n\r\nAfter the evacuation of Vilna the enemy fled, without stopping to Kovno;\r\nbut on the 2nd of December Platov’s Cossacks made their appearance in\r\nthe town, which was quickly cleared of the French. The piteous remainder\r\nof that once brilliant army crossed the Niemen; only 1,000 men with nine\r\nguns and about 20,000 unarmed men were left of it. “God punished the\r\nfoolish,” wrote the emperor Nicholas twenty-seven years later in his\r\norder of the day to the troops, on the occasion of the unveiling of the\r\nBorodino monument; “the bones of the audacious foreigners were scattered\r\nfrom Moscow to the Niemen--and we entered Paris.”[g]\r\n\r\n\r\nCAMPAIGNS OF THE GRAND ALLIANCE (1813-1814 A.D.)\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [1813 A.D.]]\r\n\r\nRallying with amazing promptitude from the tremendous blow he had\r\nsuffered in Russia, Napoleon raised a fresh army of 300,000 men in\r\nthe beginning of 1813, in order to crush the insurrection in which\r\nall northern Germany had joined, with the exception of Saxony, after\r\nPrussia had openly adhered to the Russian alliance. By the Treaty of\r\nKalish, which established that alliance, Alexander engaged not to lay\r\ndown his arms until Prussia had recovered the territory it possessed\r\nbefore the war of 1800. Great efforts were now made by the cabinets\r\nof St. Petersburg and Berlin to detach Austria from France; and so\r\nstrongly were the national feelings declared in favour of that policy,\r\nthat Metternich had the utmost difficulty in withstanding the torrent,\r\nand evading the hazard of committing his government prematurely.\r\nTemporising with consummate art, he offered the mediation of his\r\ngovernment between the hostile parties, and at the same time prosecuted\r\nhis military preparations on such a scale as would enable Austria to act\r\nno subordinate part on the one side or the other in the coming struggle.\r\nMeanwhile, hostilities began; the Russians and Prussians were defeated by\r\nNapoleon at Lützen and at Bautzen, where Alexander commanded the allied\r\narmies in person; and they were fortunate in concluding an armistice with\r\nhim at Pleisswitz on the 4th of June, 1813. They availed themselves of\r\nthis truce to reinforce their armies, and more than sixty thousand fresh\r\ntroops reached the seat of war from the south and the middle of Russia.\r\n\r\nOn the 27th, Austria signed a treaty at Reichenbach, in Silesia,\r\nwith Russia and Prussia, by which she bound herself to declare war\r\nwith France, in case Napoleon had not, before the termination of the\r\narmistice, accepted the terms of peace about to be proposed to him. A\r\npretended congress for the arrangement of the treaty was again agreed\r\nto by both sides; but Napoleon delayed to grant full powers to his\r\nenvoy, and the allies, who had meanwhile heard of Wellington’s victory\r\nat Vittoria and the expulsion of the French from Spain, gladly seized\r\nthis pretext to break off the negotiations. Meanwhile, Metternich, whose\r\nvoice was virtually to decide Napoleon’s fate, met him at Dresden with\r\nan offer of peace, on condition of the surrender of the French conquests\r\nin Germany. Napoleon, with an infatuation only equalled by his attempts\r\nto negotiate at Moscow, spurned the proposal, and even went the length\r\nof charging Count Metternich with taking bribes from England. The\r\nconference, which was conducted on Napoleon’s part in so insulting a\r\nmanner, and at times in tones of passion so violent as to be overheard\r\nby the attendants, lasted till near midnight on the 10th of August, the\r\nday with which the armistice was to expire. The fatal hour passed by,\r\nand that night Count Metternich drew up the declaration of war, on the\r\npart of his government, against France. Austria coalesced with Russia and\r\nPrussia, and the Austrian general, Prince Schwarzenberg, was appointed\r\ngeneralissimo of the whole of the allied armies.\r\n\r\nThe plan of the allies was to advance with the main body under\r\nSchwarzenberg, 190,000 strong, through the Hartz mountains to Napoleon’s\r\nrear. Blücher, with 95,000 men, was meanwhile to cover Silesia, or in\r\ncase of an attack by Napoleon’s main body to retire before it and draw\r\nit further eastward. Bernadotte, crown prince of Sweden, was to cover\r\nBerlin with 90,000 men, and in case of a victory was to form a junction,\r\nrearward of Napoleon, with the main body of the allied army. A mixed\r\ndivision under Wallmoden, 30,000 strong, was destined to watch Davout\r\nin Hamburg, whilst the Bavarian and Italian frontiers were respectively\r\nguarded by 25,000 Austrians under Prince Reuss, and 40,000 Austrians\r\nunder Hiller. Napoleon’s main body, consisting of 250,000 men, was\r\nconcentrated in and around Dresden.\r\n\r\nThe campaign opened with the march of a French force under Oudinot\r\nagainst Berlin. This attack having completely failed, Napoleon marched\r\nin person against Blücher, who cautiously retired before him. Dresden\r\nbeing thus left uncovered, the allies changed their plan of operations,\r\nand marched straight upon the Saxon capital. But they arrived too late,\r\nNapoleon having already returned thither, after despatching Vandamme’s\r\ncorps to Bohemia, to seize the passes and cut off Schwarzenberg’s\r\nretreat. The allies attempted to storm Dresden, on the 26th of August,\r\nbut were repulsed after suffering a frightful loss. On the following day\r\nNapoleon assumed the offensive, cut off the left wing of the allies, and\r\nmade an immense number of prisoners, chiefly Austrians. The main body\r\nfled in all directions; part of the troops disbanded, and the whole must\r\nhave been annihilated but for the misfortune of Vandamme, who was taken\r\nprisoner, with his whole corps, on the 29th. It was at the battle of\r\nDresden that Moreau, who had come from his exile in America to aid the\r\nallies against his old rival Napoleon, was killed by a cannon ball whilst\r\nhe was speaking to the emperor Alexander.\r\n\r\nAt the same time (August 26th) a splendid victory was gained by\r\nBlücher, on the Katzbach, over Macdonald, who reached Dresden almost\r\nalone, to say to Napoleon, “Your army of the Bober is no longer in\r\nexistence.” This disaster to the French arms was followed by the\r\ndefeat of Ney at Dennewitz by the Prussians and Swedes on the 6th of\r\nSeptember. Napoleon’s generals were thrown back in every quarter, with\r\nimmense loss, on Dresden, towards which the allies now advanced again,\r\nthreatening to enclose it on every side. Napoleon manœuvred until the\r\nbeginning of October, with the view of executing a _coup de main_ against\r\nSchwarzenberg and Blücher, but their caution foiled him, and at length\r\nhe found himself compelled to retreat, lest he should be cut off from\r\nthe Rhine, for Blücher had crossed the Elbe, joined Bernadotte, and\r\napproached the head of the main army under Schwarzenberg. Moreover, the\r\nBavarian army under Wrede declared against the French on the 8th of\r\nOctober, and was sent to the Main to cut off their retreat. Marching\r\nto Leipsic, the emperor there encountered the allies on the 16th of\r\nOctober, and fought an indecisive action, which, however, was in his\r\ncase equivalent to a defeat. He strove to negotiate a separate peace\r\nwith the emperor of Austria, as he had before done with regard to the\r\nemperor of Russia, but no answer was returned to his proposals. After\r\nsome partial engagements on the 17th, the main battle was renewed on the\r\n18th; it raged with prodigious violence all day, and ended in the defeat\r\nof Napoleon; Leipsic was stormed on the following day, and the French\r\nemperor narrowly escaped being taken prisoner. He had lost 60,000 men in\r\nthe four days’ battle; with the remainder of his troops he made a hasty\r\nand disorderly retreat, and after losing many more in his disastrous\r\nflight, he crossed the Rhine on the 20th of October with 70,000 men. The\r\ngarrisons he had left behind gradually surrendered, and by November all\r\nGermany, as far as the Rhine, was freed from the presence of the French.\r\n\r\nIn the following month the allies simultaneously invaded France in\r\nthree directions: Bülow from Holland, Blücher from Coblentz, and\r\nSchwarzenberg, with the allied sovereigns, by Switzerland and the Jura;\r\nwhilst Wellington also was advancing from the Pyrenees, at the head of\r\nthe army which had liberated the peninsula. In twenty-five days after\r\ntheir passage of the Rhine the allied armies had succeeded, almost\r\nwithout firing a shot, in wresting a third of France from the grasp of\r\nNapoleon. Their united forces stretched diagonally across France in a\r\nline three hundred miles long, from the frontiers of Flanders to the\r\nbanks of the Rhone. On the other hand, the French emperor, though his\r\nforce was little more than a third of that which was at the command\r\nof the allies, had the advantage of an incomparably more concentrated\r\nposition, his troops being all stationed within the limits of a narrow\r\ntriangle, of which Paris, Laon, and Troyes formed the angles. Besides\r\nthis, there was no perfect unanimity among his enemies. Austria,\r\nleaning on the matrimonial alliance, was reluctant to push matters to\r\nextremities, if it could possibly be avoided; Russia and Prussia were\r\nresolute to overthrow Napoleon’s dynasty; whilst the councils of England,\r\nwhich in this diversity held the balance, were as yet divided as to the\r\nfinal issue. There was a prospect, therefore, that the want of concert\r\nbetween the allies would afford profitable opportunities to the military\r\ngenius of the French emperor.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [1814 A.D.]]\r\n\r\nOn the 29th of January, 1814, Napoleon made an unexpected attack on\r\nBlücher’s corps at Brienne, in which the Prussian marshal narrowly\r\nescaped being made prisoner. But not being pursued with sufficient\r\nvigour, and having procured reinforcements, Blücher had his revenge at\r\nLa Rothière, where he attacked Napoleon with superior forces and routed\r\nhim. Still Schwarzenberg delayed his advance and divided his troops,\r\nwhilst Blücher, pushing rapidly forward on Paris, was again unexpectedly\r\nattacked by the main body of the French army, and all his corps, as\r\nthey severally advanced, were defeated with terrible loss, between the\r\n10th and 14th of February. On the 17th, Napoleon routed the advanced\r\nguard of the main army at Nangis, and again on the 18th he inflicted a\r\nheavy defeat on them at Montereau. Augereau, meanwhile, with an army\r\nlevied in the south of France, had driven the Austrians under Bubna into\r\nSwitzerland, and had posted himself at Geneva, in the rear of the allies,\r\nwho became so alarmed as to resolve on a general retreat, and proposed an\r\narmistice. Negotiations for peace had been in progress for several weeks\r\nat Châtillon, and the allies were now more than ever desirous that the\r\nterms they offered should be accepted. But so confident was Napoleon in\r\nthe returning good fortune of his arms, that he would not even consent to\r\na suspension of hostilities while the conferences for an armistice were\r\ngoing on. As for the conference at Châtillon, he used it only as a means\r\nto gain time, fully resolved not to purchase peace by the reduction of\r\nhis empire within the ancient limits of the French monarchy.\r\n\r\nBlücher became furious on being informed of the intention to retreat, and\r\nwith the approval of the emperor Alexander, he resolved to separate from\r\nthe main army, and push on for Paris. Being reinforced on the Marne by\r\nWinzingerode and Bülow, he encountered Napoleon at Craon on the 7th of\r\nMarch. The battle was one of the most obstinately contested of the whole\r\nrevolutionary war; the loss on both sides was enormous, but neither could\r\nclaim a victory. Two days afterwards the emperor was defeated at Laon;\r\nbut Blücher’s army was reduced to inactivity by fatigue and want of food.\r\n\r\nNapoleon now turned upon the grand army, which he encountered at\r\nArcis-sur-Aube; but after an indecisive action, he deliberately\r\nretreated, not towards Paris but in the direction of the Rhine. His plan\r\nwas to occupy the fortresses in the rear of the allies, form a junction\r\nwith Augereau, who was then defending Lyons, and, with the aid of a\r\ngeneral rising of the peasantry in Alsace and Lorraine, surround and\r\ncut off the invaders, or, at least, compel them to retreat to the Rhine.\r\nBut this plan being made known to the allies by an intercepted letter\r\nfrom Napoleon to the empress, they frustrated it by at once marching with\r\nflying banners upon Paris, leaving behind only ten thousand men, under\r\nWinzingerode, to amuse Napoleon, and mask their movement. After repulsing\r\nMortier and Marmont, and capturing the forces under Pacthod and Amey, the\r\nallies defiled within sight of Paris on the 29th. On the 30th they met\r\nwith a spirited resistance on the heights of Belleville and Montmartre;\r\nbut the city, in order to escape bombardment, capitulated during the\r\nnight; and on the 31st, the sovereigns of Russia and Prussia made a\r\npeaceful entry. The emperor of Austria had remained at Lyons.[k]\r\n\r\n\r\nALEXANDER I AT THE CAPITULATION OF PARIS (1814 A.D.)\r\n\r\nThe success at Paris was dearly bought; on the day of the battle the\r\nallies lost 8,400 men, of whom 6,000 were Russians. The magnitude of\r\nthe losses is explained by the absence of unity in the operations of\r\nthe allies and the consequent want of simultaneousness in the attacks\r\nfrom all parts of the allied army. However, the success of the day dealt\r\na direct and decisive blow at the very strongest part of the enemy’s\r\nposition. While negotiations were being carried on with the French\r\nmarshals for the surrender of Paris, the emperor Alexander made the tour\r\nof the troops, which were disposed near Belleville and Chaumont, and\r\ncongratulated them on the victory; he then raised Count Barclay de Tolly\r\nto the rank of field-marshal. After that he returned to Bondy.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile negotiations for the capitulation of Paris were being carried\r\non in a house occupied by Marshal Marmont. There a large company had\r\nassembled anxiously awaiting the decision of the fate of Paris. At the\r\nhead of those present was Talleyrand. An agreement between the French and\r\nthe representatives of the allied armies was at last arrived at, and at\r\nthe third hour after midnight the capitulation of Paris, composed by M.\r\nF. Orlov, was signed; the victors, however, had to give up their original\r\nstipulation that the French troops which had defended Paris should retire\r\nby the Brittany route. In the concluding 8th article of the capitulation,\r\nspecially referring to the approaching occupation of Paris by the allies,\r\nit was said that the town of Paris was recommended to the generosity of\r\nthe allied powers.\r\n\r\nOrlov told Marshal Marmont that the representatives of the town of\r\nParis could unrestrainedly express their desires in person to the\r\nemperor Alexander. A deputation from the town was therefore assembled\r\nwhich should proceed without delay to the headquarters of the allies;\r\nit consisted of the prefect of police Pasquier, the prefect of the\r\nSeine Chabrolles, and a few members of the municipal council and\r\nrepresentatives of the garde nationale. At dawn the deputies set off in\r\ncarriages for Bondy accompanied by Colonel Orlov, who led them through\r\nthe Russian bivouacs.\r\n\r\nOn their arrival at headquarters the French were taken into a large\r\nroom in the castle. Orlov ordered that his arrival should be announced\r\nto Count Nesselrode, who went to meet the deputies whilst Orlov went\r\nstraight to the emperor, who received him lying in bed. “What news do you\r\nbring?” asked the emperor. “Your majesty, here is the capitulation of\r\nParis,” answered Orlov. Alexander took the capitulation, read it, folded\r\nthe paper, and putting it under his pillow, said, “I congratulate you;\r\nyour name is linked with a great event.”\r\n\r\nAt the time when the above described events were taking place before\r\nParis, Napoleon had made the following arrangements. When Winzingerode’s\r\ndivision reached Saint-Dizier Napoleon moved from Doulevant to\r\nBar-sur-Aube. In order to ascertain the real intentions of the allies\r\nhe ordered increased reconnoitering, which led to the combat at\r\nSaint-Dizier, and Winzingerode was thrown back on Bar-le-Duc. From the\r\nquestions addressed to prisoners Napoleon was convinced that only the\r\ncavalry division was left against him and that the chief forces of\r\nthe allies were directed towards Paris. “This is a fine chess move! I\r\nshould never have thought that a general of the coalition would have\r\nbeen capable of it!” exclaimed Napoleon. Without delaying, on the 27th\r\nof March, Napoleon directed the forces he had at his disposal towards\r\nParis by a circuitous route through Troyes and Fontainebleau. On the\r\n30th of March, at daybreak, when the allies were already before Paris\r\nand were preparing to attack the capital, Napoleon and his vanguard had\r\nhardly reached Troyes (150 versts from Paris). In the hope that at least\r\nby his presence he might amend matters in Paris, the emperor left the\r\ntroops behind and galloped off to Fontainebleau; arriving there at night,\r\nhe continued his journey without stopping to Paris. But it was already\r\nlate, and on the night of the 31st of March, at twenty versts from Paris,\r\nNapoleon met the fore ranks of the already departing French troops, from\r\nwhom he learned of the capitulation concluded by Marmont. At six in the\r\nmorning Napoleon returned to Fontainebleau.\r\n\r\nIt was about the same time, on the morning of the 31st of March, that\r\nthe deputation from Paris was received by the emperor Alexander at\r\nBondy. Count Nesselrode presented the members by name to the emperor;\r\nafter which Alexander addressed to them a discourse which Pasquier has\r\nreproduced in his Mémoires in the following manner: “I have but one enemy\r\nin France, and that enemy is the man who has deceived me in the most\r\nshameless manner, who has abused my trust, who has broken every vow to\r\nme, and who has carried into my dominions the most iniquitous and odious\r\nof wars. All reconciliation between him and me is henceforth impossible,\r\nbut I repeat I have no other enemy in France. All other Frenchmen are\r\nfavourably regarded by me. I esteem France and the French, and I trust\r\nthat they will enable me to help them. I honour the courage and glory\r\nof all the brave men against who I have been fighting for two years and\r\nwhom I have learned to respect in every position in which they have found\r\nthemselves. I shall always be ready to render to them the justice and the\r\nhonour which are their due. Say then, gentlemen, to the Parisians, that I\r\ndo not enter their walls as an enemy, and that it only depends on them to\r\nhave me for a friend, but say also that I have one sole enemy in France,\r\nand that with him I am irreconcilable.” Pasquier adds that this thought\r\nwas repeated in twenty different tones and always with the expression of\r\nthe utmost vehemence, the emperor meanwhile pacing up and down the room.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE RUSSIAN OCCUPATION OF PARIS\r\n\r\nThen entering into details as to the occupation of Paris, the emperor\r\nAlexander consented to leave the preservation of tranquillity in the\r\ncapital to the national guard, and gave his word that he would require\r\nnothing from the inhabitants, beyond provisions for the army; it was\r\ndecided that the troops should be bivouacked. Having dismissed the\r\ndeputation, the emperor Alexander ordered Count Nesselrode to set off\r\nimmediately for Paris to Talleyrand and concert with him as to the\r\nmeasures to be taken in the commencement; the count entered the town\r\naccompanied by a single Cossack.\r\n\r\n“The boulevards were covered with well-dressed crowds of people,”\r\nwrites Count Nesselrode in his Mémoires. “It seemed as if the people\r\nhad assembled for a holiday rather than to assist at the entry of the\r\nenemy’s troops. Talleyrand was at his toilet; his hair only half-done;\r\nhe rushed to meet me, threw himself into my arms and bestrewed me with\r\npowder. When he was somewhat tranquillised he ordered certain persons\r\nwith whom he was conspiring to be called. They were the duke of Dalberg,\r\nthe abbe de Pradt, and Baron Louis. I transmitted the desires of the\r\nemperor Alexander to my companions, telling them that he remained firmly\r\ndetermined upon one point--not to leave Napoleon on the throne of\r\nFrance; that later on the question as to what order of things must from\r\nhenceforth reign would be decided by his majesty, not otherwise than\r\nafter consultation with the prominent personages with whom he would be\r\nbrought into relations.”[57]\r\n\r\nThe emperor Alexander had intended to stop at the Élysée palace (Élysée\r\nBourbon), but, having received information that mines had been laid\r\nunder the palace, he sent the communication on to Count Nesselrode; when\r\nTalleyrand heard of it he would not believe the truth of the information,\r\nbut, from excess of caution, he proposed that the emperor should stay\r\nwith him until the necessary investigations should be made. In all\r\nprobability the alarm raised had been prepared by the dexterity of Prince\r\nBénévent himself, who thus made sure of the presence of the head of the\r\ncoalition in his house.\r\n\r\nAfter Count Nesselrode’s departure for Paris, Colencourt made his\r\nappearance at Bondy, being sent to the emperor Alexander by Napoleon\r\nwith proposals for the conclusion of immediate peace on conditions\r\nsimilar to those exacted by the allied powers at Châtillon. The emperor\r\ntold the duke of Vicenza that he considered himself bound to secure the\r\ntranquillity of Europe, and that therefore neither he nor his allies\r\nintended to carry on negotiations with Napoleon. It was in vain that\r\nColencourt endeavoured to shake Alexander’s decision, representing to\r\nhim that the allied monarchs, by deposing from the throne a sovereign\r\nwhom they had all acknowledged, would show themselves upholders of the\r\ndestructive ideas of the revolution. “The allied monarchs do not desire\r\nthe overthrow of thrones,” replied Alexander, “they will support not any\r\nparticular party of those dissatisfied with the present government but\r\nthe general voice of the most estimable men of France. We have decided\r\nto continue the struggle to the end, in order that it may not have to be\r\nrenewed under less favourable circumstances, and we shall combat until we\r\nattain a solid and durable peace, which it is impossible to look for from\r\nthe man who has devastated Europe from Moscow to Cadiz.” In conclusion\r\nAlexander promised to receive Colencourt at any time in Paris.\r\n\r\n“The subjection of Paris has shown itself to be an indispensable\r\ninheritance for our chroniclers. Russians could not open the glorious\r\nbook of their history without shame if after the page on which Napoleon\r\nis represented standing amidst Moscow in flames did not follow that where\r\nAlexander appears in the midst of Paris.”\r\n\r\nAs he left Bondy, Napoleon’s envoy saw the horse prepared for Alexander\r\nto ride on his approaching entry into Paris; it was a light-grey horse\r\ncalled Eclipse which had formerly been presented to the emperor when\r\nColencourt was ambassador in St. Petersburg. About eight o’clock in the\r\nmorning Alexander left Bondy. “All were prepared to meet a day unexampled\r\nin history,” writes an eye-witness.\r\n\r\nAfter he had ridden about a verst, the emperor met the king of Prussia\r\nand the guards; letting the Russian guard and his own guard’s light\r\ncavalry pass in front, as they were to head the troops entering Paris,\r\nAlexander followed after them with the king of Prussia and Prince\r\nSchwarzenberg, accompanied by a suite of more than a thousand generals\r\nand officers of various nationalities. After them came the Austrian\r\ngrenadiers, the Russian grenadier corps, the foot-guards, and three\r\ndivisions of cuirassiers with artillery. The most superb weather favoured\r\nthe triumph of this memorable day.\r\n\r\nWhat were the feelings which then filled the soul of Alexander? Of what\r\nwas the sovereign thinking that had lived through the painful experiences\r\nof Austerlitz, the glitter of Tilsit, changing to the defeat of Friedland\r\nand the burning of Moscow? In entire humility he was prepared to repay\r\nthe evil and mortification he had endured by a magnanimity unheard of\r\nin history. Actually there appeared in the midst of Paris a victor who\r\nsought for no other triumph but the happiness of the vanquished. Even\r\nat Vilna, in December, 1812, the emperor Alexander had said: “Napoleon\r\nmight have given peace to Europe. He might have--but he did not! Now\r\nthe enchantment has vanished. Let us see which is best: to make oneself\r\nfeared or beloved.” In Paris a noble field awaited the emperor for\r\nchanging into action these generous thoughts and aspirations after the\r\nideal.\r\n\r\nThe streets were crowded with people, and even the roofs of the houses\r\nwere covered with curious spectators. White draperies hung from the\r\nwindows and the women at the windows and on the balconies waved white\r\nhandkerchiefs. Henri Houssaye has very justly defined the frame of mind\r\nof the Parisian population on the day of the 31st of March: “They did\r\nnot reason, they breathed.” Answering graciously to the greetings of the\r\npopulace, the emperor said in a loud voice: “I do not come as an enemy.\r\nI come to bring you peace and commerce.” The emperor’s words called\r\nforth acclamations and exclamations of “_Vive la paix!_” A Frenchman who\r\nhad managed to push his way right up to the emperor said: “We have been\r\nwaiting for you a long time.” “It is the fault of the bravery of your\r\ntroops if I have not come sooner,” answered Alexander. “How handsome the\r\nemperor Alexander is, how graciously he bows. He must stay in Paris or\r\ngive us a sovereign like himself,” said the French to each other.\r\n\r\nThe allied troops were met with joyful exclamations of “Long live\r\nAlexander! Long live the Russians! Long live the allies!” As the allies\r\napproached the Champs-Élysées, the enthusiasm grew and began to assume\r\nthe character of a demonstration against the government of Napoleon;\r\nwhite cockades made their appearance on hats and the exclamations\r\nresounded: “Long live the Bourbons! Down with the tyrant!” All these\r\nmanifestations did not, however, arouse the least sympathy among the\r\npeople for the Bourbons, who were unknown to it; the movement was purely\r\nsuperficial and partly artificial. The French, seeing the white bands\r\non the Russian uniforms, imagined that Europe had taken up arms for the\r\nBourbons, and in their turn showed the colour for which in their hearts\r\nthey had no sympathy.\r\n\r\n\r\nALEXANDER I AND THE CONGRESS OF VIENNA (1815 A.D.)\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [1815 A.D.]]\r\n\r\nThe restoration of the French Empire hastened the settlement of the\r\ndisputed points at the congress of Vienna. On the 3rd of May, 1815,\r\ntreaties were signed between Russia, Austria, and Prussia which\r\ndetermined the fate of the duchy of Warsaw; it was forever united to the\r\nRussian Empire, with the exception of Posen, Bromberg, and Thorn, which\r\nwere given to Prussia; Cracow was declared a free town, and the salt\r\nmines of Weliczka were returned to Austria, together with the province\r\nof Tarnopol, which had belonged to Russia since 1809. Alexander took\r\nthe title King of Poland and reserved to himself the right of giving\r\nto this kingdom, which was destined to have a social government, that\r\n“interior extension” which he judged right. In general it was proposed\r\nto give to the Russian as well as the Austrian and Prussian subjects the\r\nright of national representation and national government institutions\r\nin conformity with the form of political states which each government\r\nwould consider most advantageous and most fitted to the sphere of\r\nits possessions. On the same day a treaty was concluded between the\r\nplenipotentiaries of Prussia and Saxony, according to the conditions of\r\nwhich the king of Saxony ceded to Prussia almost all Lusatia and a part\r\nof Saxony. Finally, more than a month later, on the 8th of June, 1815,\r\nthe act of the German alliance was signed, and on the following day, the\r\n9th of June, the chief act of the congress of Vienna.\r\n\r\nUpon the basis of the conditions of the treaty of 1815, Russia increased\r\nher territory to the extent of about 2,100 square miles with a population\r\nof more than three millions; Austria acquired 2,300 square miles with\r\nthe million inhabitants, and Prussia 2,217 square miles with 5,362,000\r\ninhabitants. Thus Russia, who had borne all the three years’ war with\r\nNapoleon, and made the greatest sacrifices for the triumph of the\r\ninterests of Europe, received the smallest reward.\r\n\r\nA few days before the signing of the treaties that determined the fate\r\nof the duchy of Warsaw, which had so long remained in an indefinite\r\nposition, the emperor Alexander informed the president of the Polish\r\nsenate, Count Ostrovski, of the approaching union of the kingdom of\r\nPoland to the Russian empire. In this letter, amongst other things, it\r\nwas said: “If in the great interest of general tranquillity it could not\r\nbe permitted that all the Poles should become united under one sceptre,\r\nI have at least endeavoured as far as possible to soften the hardships\r\nof their separation and to obtain for them everywhere all possible\r\nenjoyment of their nationality.” Following upon this came the manifesto\r\nto the inhabitants of the kingdom of Poland granting them a constitution,\r\nself-government, an army of their own, and freedom of the press.\r\n\r\nOn the 21st of May, 1815, the solemnity of the restoration of the\r\nkingdom of Poland was celebrated in Warsaw. In his letter to the emperor\r\nAlexander, Prince Adam Czartoriski expressed the conviction that the\r\nremembrance of that day would be for the generous heart of the sovereign\r\na reward for his labours for the good of humanity. All the functionaries\r\nof the state assembled in the Catholic cathedral church, where, after\r\ndivine service had been celebrated, were read the act of renunciation\r\nof the king of Saxony, the manifesto of the emperor of all the Russias,\r\nking of Poland, and the basis of the future constitution. The council\r\nof the empire, the senate, the officials, and the inhabitants then took\r\nthe oath of allegiance to the sovereign and the constitution. Then the\r\nPolish standard with the white eagle was raised over the royal castle\r\nand on all government buildings, whilst in all the churches thanksgiving\r\nservices were celebrated, accompanied by the pealing of bells and firing\r\nof cannon. After this all the state dignitaries set off to wait on the\r\nczarevitch, Constantine Pavlovitch. The troops were assembled in the\r\nplain near Wola, where an altar had been erected; there, in the presence\r\nof the august commander-in-chief of the Polish army, the soldiers took\r\nthe oath in battalions. The cannonades and salvoes of artillery which\r\nconcluded the solemnity were interrupted by the loud exclamations of the\r\npeople: “Long live our king Alexander!”\r\n\r\nPrince Adam Czartoriski, who had been sent by the emperor from Vienna,\r\noccupied a place in the council. On the 25th of May Alexander wrote to\r\nhim as follows: “You have had occasion to become acquainted with my\r\nintentions as to the institutions that I wish to establish in Poland,\r\nand the improvements that I desire to carry on in that country. You\r\nwill endeavour never to lose sight of them during the deliberations of\r\nthe council and to direct the attention of your colleagues to them in\r\norder that the course of government and the reforms, which are confided\r\nto them to bring into execution, may be in accordance with my views.”\r\nA committee was formed for the framing of a constitution, composed of\r\nPolish dignitaries under the presidency of Count Ostrovski.\r\n\r\nBut this benign condition of affairs in the newly created kingdom was\r\nnot of long duration, and on the 29th of July, 1815, Prince Czartoriski\r\nhad to complain to the emperor of the czarevitch, and expressed his\r\nconviction that no enemy could occasion greater injuries to Alexander.\r\nIt was, he said, as though he wished to bring matters to a rupture. “No\r\nzeal, no submission can soften him,” wrote Prince Adam to the emperor.\r\n“Neither the army, nor the nation, nor private individuals can find\r\nfavour in his sight. The constitution in particular gives him occasion\r\nfor ceaseless, bitter derision; everything of rule, form, or law is\r\nmade the object of mockery and laughter, and unfortunately deeds have\r\nalready followed upon words. The grand duke does not even observe the\r\nmilitary laws which he himself has established. He absolutely wishes\r\nto bring in corporal punishments and gave orders yesterday that they\r\nshould be brought into force, in spite of the unanimous representations\r\nof the committee. Desertion, which is already now considerable, will\r\nbecome general; in September most of the officers will ask for their\r\ndischarge. In fact, it is as if a plan were laid to oppose the views\r\nof your majesty, in order to render the benefits you have conferred\r\nvoid, in order to frustrate from the very beginning the success of your\r\nenterprise. His imperial highness in such a case would be, without\r\nhimself knowing it, the blind instrument of this destructive design,\r\nof which the first effect would be to exasperate equally both Russians\r\nand Poles and to take away all power from your majesty’s most solemn\r\ndeclarations. What would I not give for it to be possible to here satisfy\r\nthe grand duke and fulfil the desires of your majesty in this respect!\r\nBut this is decidedly impossible, and if he remains here I on the\r\ncontrary foresee the most lamentable consequences!”\r\n\r\nIndeed, as we look more closely into the state of affairs in Warsaw in\r\nthe year 1815, it remains an unsolved enigma how the emperor Alexander,\r\nknowing as he did the indomitable character of his brother, could resolve\r\nto confide the destiny of the kingdom he had newly created to the wilful,\r\narbitrary hands of the czarevitch, whose personality as the probable\r\nheir to the throne of Russia had disturbed the Poles since the time of\r\nthe termination of the war of 1812. Prince Czartoriski’s letter did not\r\nalter Alexander’s determination: the czarevitch remained in Warsaw, and\r\ncontinued his impolitic course of action, the lamentable results of which\r\nwere revealed by subsequent events.\r\n\r\nOn the 21st of May in Vienna the emperor signed the manifesto calling\r\nupon all the powers who observed the laws of truth and piety to take up\r\narms against the usurper of the French throne. In the same manifesto the\r\nannexation to Russia of the greater part of the former duchy of Warsaw\r\nwas announced: “Security is thus given to our frontiers, a firm defence\r\nis raised, calumnies and inimical attempts are repulsed, and the ties of\r\nbrotherhood renewed between races mutually united by a common origin. We\r\nhave therefore considered it advantageous to assure the destiny of this\r\ncountry by basing its interior administration upon special regulations,\r\npeculiar to the speech and customs of the inhabitants and adapted to\r\ntheir local position. Following the teaching of the Christian law, whose\r\ndominion embraces so vast a number of people of various races, but at the\r\nsame time preserves their distinctive qualities and customs unchanged,\r\nwe have desired in creating the happiness of our new subjects, to plant\r\nin their hearts the feeling of devotion to our throne and thus for ever\r\nefface the traces of former misfortunes arising from pernicious discord\r\nand protracted struggles.” Without waiting for the termination of the\r\ncongress the emperor Alexander left Vienna on the 25th of May; he desired\r\nto be nearer the Rhine until the arrival of the Russian troops and in\r\ncloser proximity to the seat of the approaching military action.[g] The\r\nRussians, however, who were to have formed the army of the middle Rhine,\r\nwere unable, though making forced marches, to arrive in time to take part\r\nin the brief campaign which terminated Napoleon’s reign of the hundred\r\ndays.[k]\r\n\r\n\r\nALEXANDER’S RELIGIOUS MYSTICISM; BARONESS KRÜDENER\r\n\r\nWhen he had left Vienna, the emperor Alexander stopped for a short time\r\nat Munich and Stuttgart, and on the 4th of June he arrived at Heilbronn,\r\nwhich had been chosen for the Russian headquarters. Here took place his\r\nfirst meeting with Baroness Juliane Krüdener.\r\n\r\nBaroness Krüdener (born Vietinghov), the author of the famous novel\r\n_Valérie_, had already long since been converted from a vain woman\r\nof the world, and had entered upon the path of mystical pietism. Her\r\nacquaintance with the Moravian brethren and in particular with Johann\r\nJung had definitely confirmed her ideas in a pious philanthropic\r\ndirection. With the exaltation that was natural to her she became more\r\nand more persuaded that a great work lay before her, that God himself\r\nhad entrusted her with a lofty mission, to turn the unbelieving to the\r\npath of truth. As her biographer observes, she was ready to affirm in\r\nimitation of Louis XIV that “_Le ciel c’est moi_” (Heaven is I). In 1814\r\nBaroness Krüdener became intimate with the maid of honour Mlle. R. S.\r\nSturdza, and through her penetrated to the empress Elizabeth Alexievna.\r\n\r\nBut, according to her own words, an inward voice told her that the matter\r\nwas not to end there; the final aim of her aspiration was a friendship\r\nwith the emperor Alexander, whose spiritual condition at that time was\r\nfully known to her from her conversations with Mademoiselle Sturdza as\r\nwell as after the emperor’s interviews with Johann Jung which took place\r\nduring his majesty’s stay at Bronchsaal. During the congress of Vienna\r\nJuliane Krüdener kept up an active correspondence with Mademoiselle\r\nSturdza; in it she referred to the emperor Alexander and the great and\r\nbeautiful qualities of his soul. “I have already known for some time that\r\nthe Lord will grant me the joy of seeing him,” wrote Baroness Krüdener;\r\n“if I live till then, it will be one of the happiest moments of my life.\r\nI have a multitude of things to tell him, for I have investigated much on\r\nhis behalf: the Lord alone can prepare his heart to receive them; I am\r\nnot uneasy about it; my business is to be without fear and reproach; his,\r\nto bow down before Christ, the truth.” With these spiritual effusions\r\nwere artfully mixed mysterious prophecies, such as: “The storm draws\r\nnigh, the lilies have appeared only to vanish.”\r\n\r\nMademoiselle Sturdza was struck by these mysterious prognostications\r\nand showed the letter to the emperor Alexander; he commissioned her\r\nto write to Baroness Krüdener that he would esteem it a happiness to\r\nmeet her. The correspondence was further prolonged in the same spirit\r\nand finally the “prince of darkness” appeared on the scene, preventing\r\nher conversing with Alexander, that instrument of mercy, of heavenly\r\nthings. “But the Almighty will be stronger than he,” wrote Baroness\r\nKrüdener; “God, who loves to make use of those who in the eyes of the\r\nworld serve as objects of humiliation and mockery, has prepared my heart\r\nfor that submission which does not seek the approval of men. I am only a\r\nnonentity. He is everything, and earthly kings tremble before Him.” The\r\nemperor Alexander’s first religious transport, in the mystical sense, had\r\nmanifested itself in the year 1812, when heavy trials fell upon Russia\r\nand filled his soul with alarm. His religious aspirations could not be\r\nsatisfied with the usual forms and ceremonies of the church; in the\r\nmatter of religion he sought for something different. Having separated\r\nhimself, under the influence of fatal events, from those humanitarian\r\nideals which to a certain degree had animated him in his youth he had\r\nadopted religious conventions; but here, also, by the nature of his\r\ncharacter, he was governed by aspirations after the ideal, without,\r\nhowever, departing from the sentimental romanticism that was peculiar\r\nto him. Under such conditions Alexander must necessarily have been\r\nimpressionable to the influence of pietists and mystics.\r\n\r\nWhen he came to Heilbronn he was overwhelmed with weariness and sadness\r\nafter the pompous receptions at the courts of Munich and Würtemberg,\r\nand his soul thirsted for solitude. During the first interview Baroness\r\nKrüdener lifted the veil of the past before the eyes of Alexander and\r\nrepresented to him his life with all its errors of ambition and vain\r\npride; she proved to her listener that the momentary awakening of\r\nconscience, the acknowledgment of weaknesses, and temporary repentance do\r\nnot constitute a full expiation of sins, and do not yet lead to spiritual\r\nregeneration. “No, your majesty,” said she to him, “you have not yet\r\ndrawn near to the god man, as a criminal begging for mercy. You have not\r\nyet received forgiveness from him, who alone has the power to absolve\r\nsins upon earth. You are still in your sins. You have not yet humbled\r\nyourself before Jesus, you have not yet said, like the publican, from the\r\ndepths of your heart: ‘God, I am a great sinner; have mercy upon me!’ And\r\nthat is why you do not find spiritual peace. Listen to the words of a\r\nwoman, who has also been a great sinner, but who has found pardon of all\r\nher sins at the foot of the cross of Christ.” Baroness Krüdener talked to\r\nAlexander in this strain for nearly three hours. Alexander could only say\r\na few broken words, and bowing his head on his hands, he shed abundant\r\ntears. All the words he heard, were, as the Scripture expresses it, like\r\na two-edged sword, piercing to the very depths of the soul and spirit,\r\nand trying the feelings and thoughts of his heart. Finally, Baroness\r\nKrüdener, alarmed by the agitated state into which her words had thrown\r\nAlexander, said to him: “Sire, I beg you to pardon the tone in which I\r\nhave spoken. Believe that in all sincerity of heart and before God I have\r\nsaid to you truths which have never before been said to you. I have only\r\nfulfilled a sacred duty to you.” “Do not be afraid,” answered Alexander,\r\n“all your words have found a place in my heart: you have helped me to\r\ndiscover in myself what I had never before observed; I thank God for it,\r\nbut I must often have such conversations, and I ask you not to go away.”\r\n\r\nFrom that day such conversations became a spiritual necessity to the\r\nemperor Alexander and a moral support in the pathway upon which he\r\nfrom thenceforth stood. According to the opinion of Prince Galitzin,\r\nAlexander’s conversations with Baroness Krüdener were of a spiritual\r\ntendency, and perhaps only in part touched upon contemporary events.\r\n“There is no doubt,” says Prince Galitzin, “that Baroness Krüdener, who\r\nlived by faith, strengthened the development of faith in the emperor by\r\nher disinterested and experienced counsels; she certainly directed the\r\nwill of Alexander to still greater self-sacrifice and prayer, and perhaps\r\nat the same time revealed to him the secret of that spiritual, prayerful\r\ncommunion which, although designed by God as an inheritance for all\r\nmortals, is unfortunately the portion of a very few chosen ones.” From\r\nthat time it only remained for Prince Galitzin to experience a lively\r\nfeeling of satisfaction as he observed, “with what giant strides the\r\nemperor advanced in the pathway of religion.”\r\n\r\nIf the moral sphere in which Alexander began to move awakened the entire\r\nsympathy of Prince Galitzin, others looked upon the matter from another\r\npoint of view.\r\n\r\nIn accordance with the course he had adopted during the campaigns of\r\n1813 and 1814, the emperor desired to remain at the centre of military\r\noperations. This intention was not to the taste of the Austrians, and\r\nfrom their headquarters at Heidelberg they sent a notification that\r\nit was difficult to find suitable premises in such a small place and\r\nthat his majesty would be far more tranquil if he prolonged his stay\r\nat Heilbronn. The emperor ordered an answer to be sent to the effect\r\nthat he requested that only one or two houses should be allotted for\r\nhis occupation in Heidelberg, and that his headquarters should be\r\nestablished in the neighbouring villages. After this, on the 6th of June,\r\nAlexander removed to Heidelberg and finally took up his abode outside\r\nthe town, upon the banks of the Necker, in the house of an Englishman,\r\nnamed Pickford, and here remained until the 10th of June, awaiting\r\nthe approach of his army to the Rhine. The Baroness Krüdener also did\r\nnot delay removing to Heidelberg; she settled not far from the house\r\noccupied by the emperor. He spent most of his evenings with her and,\r\nlistening to her instructions, in confidential intercourse he told her\r\nof the griefs and passions which had darkened his sorrowful life. In\r\nthese conversations, the fellow traveller and collaborator of Baroness\r\nKrüdener, Empaitaz, also took part. Baroness Krüdener did not flatter\r\nAlexander, she possessed the gift of speaking the truth without giving\r\noffence. According to the opinion of her admirers she might have become a\r\nbeneficent genius for Russia, but this was hindered by the hypocrisy of\r\nvarious unworthy persons, who took advantage of this new frame of mind of\r\nthe emperor, using it as a means for the attainment of aims which were\r\nnot at all in accordance with Alexander’s lofty sentiments and intentions.\r\n\r\nBecoming more and more convinced of the power of repentance and prayer,\r\nthe emperor once said to Empaitaz: “I can assure you that when I find\r\nmyself in awkward situations I always come out of them through prayer. I\r\nwill tell you something which would greatly astonish everyone if it were\r\nknown: when I am in counsel, with ministers, who are far from sharing my\r\nprinciples, and they show themselves of opposite opinions, instead of\r\ndisputing, I lift up an inward prayer, and little by little they come\r\nround to principles of humanity and justice.”\r\n\r\nAlexander had adopted the habit of daily reading the Holy Scriptures and\r\nbegan to seek in them immediate answers to his doubts. “On the 7th of\r\nJune,” relates Empaitaz, “he read the 35th psalm; in the evening he told\r\nus that this psalm had dispersed all remaining anxiety in his soul as to\r\nthe success of the war; thenceforth he was convinced that he was acting\r\nin accordance with the will of God.”\r\n\r\n\r\nALEXANDER’S HOLY ALLIANCE (1815 A.D.)\r\n\r\nThe conclusion of the Holy Alliance belongs to this period (1815). In\r\nconceiving the idea of it, the emperor Alexander intended, independently\r\nof ordinary political negotiations, to strengthen the common bond\r\nbetween monarchies by an act based on the immutable truths of the divine\r\nteaching, to create an alliance which should bind together monarchies and\r\nnations by ties of brotherhood, consecrated by religion, and should be\r\nfor them, like the Gospel, obligatory by conscience, feeling and duty.\r\nThe emperor Alexander said one day to Baroness Krüdener: “I am leaving\r\nFrance, but before my departure I want by a public act to give due praise\r\nto God the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost, for the protection he\r\nhas shown us, and to call upon the nations to stand in obedience to the\r\nGospel. I have brought you the project of this act and ask you to look\r\nover it attentively, and if you do not approve any of the expressions\r\nused to indicate them to me. I desire that the emperor of Austria and the\r\nking of Prussia should unite with me in this act of adoration, in order\r\nthat people may see that we, like the eastern magi, confess the supreme\r\npower of God the Saviour. You will unite with me in prayer to God that my\r\nallies may be disposed to sign it.”\r\n\r\nAlexander wrote out the draft of the Act of the Holy Alliance with his\r\nown hand, and Mademoiselle Sturdza and Count Vapadistria took part in the\r\nwording of it. The latter ventured to observe that no such act was to be\r\nmet with in the annals of diplomacy and that his majesty might express\r\nthe ruling idea of the act in a declaration or manifesto. Alexander\r\nreplied that his decision was unchangeable, that he took it upon himself\r\nto obtain the signature to it of his allies, the emperor of Austria and\r\nthe king of Prussia. As to France, England, and other courts--“that,”\r\nsaid the emperor to him, “will already be your concern.”\r\n\r\nThe treaty of the Christian brotherly alliance, imagined by Alexander and\r\ncalled the Holy Alliance, consisted of three articles according to which\r\nthe allies bound themselves: (1) to remain united by the indissoluble\r\nties of brotherly friendship, to show each other help and co-operation,\r\nto govern their subjects in the same spirit of fraternity in order\r\nto maintain truth and peace; (2) to esteem themselves members of one\r\nChristian people, placed by providence to rule over three branches of\r\none and the same family; and (3) to invite all the powers to acknowledge\r\nthese rules and to enter the Holy Alliance. The sovereigns who signed\r\nthe treaty were bound, “both in ruling over their own subjects and in\r\npolitical relations with other governments, to be guided by the precepts\r\nof the holy Gospel, which, not being limited in their application to\r\nprivate life alone, should immediately govern the wills of monarchs and\r\ntheir actions.”\r\n\r\nKing Frederick William willingly declared his consent to become a member\r\nof the Holy Alliance, conceived in the same spirit as the scene that\r\nhad once taken place at night at the tomb of Frederick the Great in the\r\ngarrison church at Potsdam, and appearing to be the realisation of the\r\nthought expressed by the sovereigns after the battle of Bautzen: “If the\r\nLord blesses our undertakings,” said they, “then will we give praise to\r\nhim before the face of the whole world.”\r\n\r\nThe emperor Francis, however, received with greater reserve the proposal\r\nto join the Holy Alliance; he was in general incapable of letting himself\r\nbe carried away by fantastic ideas and romanticism or of being subject\r\nto enthusiastic impulses of any kind. He consented to sign the treaty\r\nonly after Metternich had tranquillised him with the assurance that the\r\nproject should only be regarded as inoffensive chatter. But although\r\nin his narrative of the formation of the Holy Alliance Metternich\r\ncontemptuously calls it “this empty, sonorous monument,” he passes over\r\none point in silence: by joining this treaty Austria obtained a valuable\r\ninstrument for placing Russia at the head of the reactionary movement\r\nin Europe, and Metternich did not hesitate to take advantage of this\r\ncircumstance with inimitable art in order to attain the political aims he\r\nhad traced out. Only two sovereigns did not receive invitations to join\r\nthe Holy Alliance: the pope and the sultan. The prince regent limited\r\nhimself to a letter in which he expressed his approval of the context of\r\nthe treaty, but on account of parliamentary considerations the English\r\ngovernment did not join the alliance.\r\n\r\nThe Act of the Holy Alliance concluded in Paris with the emperor of\r\nAustria and the king of Prussia remained secret for some time, as the\r\nemperor Alexander did not desire to make it generally known. Christmas\r\nDay (December 25th, 1815) (January 6th, 1816) was the occasion chosen\r\nfor the publication of the treaty. In the manifesto issued, it is said:\r\n“Having learned from experiences and consequences calamitous to the\r\nwhole world that the course of former political relations between the\r\nEuropean powers was not based on those principles of truth through which\r\nthe wisdom of God, made known in his revelation, assures the peace and\r\nprosperity of nations, we have, conjointly with their majesties, the\r\nAustrian emperor Francis I and the king of Prussia, Frederick William,\r\nentered upon the establishment of an alliance between ourselves (inviting\r\nother Christian powers to take part in the same), by which we are\r\nmutually bound, both between ourselves and in relation to our subjects,\r\nto take for the sole means of attaining our ends the rule drawn from the\r\nwords and teaching of our Saviour Jesus Christ, enjoining men to live as\r\nbrothers, not in enmity and malice, but in peace and love. We desire and\r\npray to the most High that he may send down his grace upon us, that he\r\nmay confirm this Holy Alliance between all the powers, to their common\r\nwelfare, and may no one venture to hinder unanimity by falseness to our\r\ncompact. Therefore, adding to this a transcript of the alliance, we\r\ncommand that it shall be made public and read in all churches.”\r\n\r\nThe most holy synod, in its turn, ordered that the treaty of the Holy\r\nAlliance should be printed and placed on the walls of churches or affixed\r\nto boards, and also that ideas should be borrowed from it for preaching.\r\nAnd thus, from the year 1816 Russia entered upon a new political path--an\r\napocalyptic one; from thenceforth in diplomatic documents relating\r\nto the epoch, instead of clearly defined and political aims, we meet\r\nwith obscure commentaries concerning the spirit of evil, vanquished by\r\nProvidence, the word of the Most High, the word of life.[58] The ideal of\r\nthe government administrators of that period, who stood at the head of\r\naffairs, became a sort of vague theological, patriarchal monarchy. Over\r\nEurope was lowered the dark veil of continuous and close reaction.[g]\r\n\r\nThe real significance of European history during the next period is best\r\nunderstood by studying the development of the alliances formed against\r\nthe power of Napoleon, like the one under consideration, and which\r\nendured being renewed from time to time as occasion demanded. At first\r\nthese were directed towards a definite object, but they gradually assumed\r\nwider scope, and in a spirit quite foreign to the “Holy Alliance,”\r\nendeavoured to arrest and stem the aspirations of the period, whether\r\nlegitimate or degenerate. The partly stationary, partly retrograde\r\nattitude of all, or most, of the European governments, which afterward\r\nbecame general, had its inception at this time. The spirit of absolutism,\r\nin short, found expression in the Holy Alliance. That this mystic\r\nAlliance was not suitable for any practical purpose was proved on the\r\nspot.[59]\r\n\r\nIt was quite apparent and recognised by all that France could not be left\r\nto herself, for it had been determined to leave an allied army of 150,000\r\nmen under the Duke of Wellington in possession of the French fortresses.\r\nFor what purpose and under what conditions this was to take place,\r\nnaturally had to be decided by some explicit treaty. On the same day on\r\nwhich peace with France was signed--20th November--the four powers which\r\nhad signed the Treaty of Chaumont, England, Russia, Austria, and Prussia\r\nconcluded among themselves a new Alliance of real and far-reaching\r\nsignificance. The new treaty confirmed the compacts made at Chaumont,\r\nand on the 25th of March, of the current year 1815, the allies expressed\r\ntheir conviction that the peace of Europe depended upon the consolidation\r\nof the restored order of things in France, on the maintenance of\r\nthe royal authority and of the constitutional charter; they pledged\r\nthemselves to reinforce the garrison troops in France, if necessary\r\nby 60,000 men from each of the four Powers, or if required by their\r\ncombined army, in order to exclude Bonaparte and his family for ever\r\nfrom the French throne, but to support the sovereignty of the Bourbons\r\nand the Constitution. They further agreed, after the time fixed for the\r\ninvestment of France by the allied troops had elapsed, to adopt measures\r\nfor the maintenance of the existing order of things in France and of the\r\npeace of Europe. In order to facilitate the execution of these duties and\r\nto consolidate the friendly relations of the four powers, it was arranged\r\nthat from time to time, at certain fixed intervals, meetings of the\r\nsovereigns in person or of their ministers--congresses in fact--should\r\ntake place, to consult concerning the great and common interests of the\r\nallies, and the measures that might be considered necessary at the time\r\nto promote the welfare and peace of the nations and of Europe.\r\n\r\nIt was this treaty which founded and introduced the Congress policy of\r\nthe next decade, and it is well to note that France although a member of\r\nthe Holy Alliance was excluded from this league, as was to be expected,\r\nand that England which had remained outside the Holy Alliance, here stood\r\nat the head of affairs. The true position and significance of things are\r\nthereby made clear.[j]\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES\r\n\r\n[55] [For the terms of the treaty, see volume XII.]\r\n\r\n[56] Gazing from the Kremlin on Moscow in flames, Napoleon said,\r\n“This forebodes the greatest calamity for us.” _Journal du Maréchal\r\nCastellane_, Paris, 1895.\r\n\r\n[57] From the Russian State Archives.\r\n\r\n[58] The letter written by Emperor Alexander on the 18th of March,\r\n1816, to Count Sieven, Ambassador in London, upon the occasion of the\r\npublication of the treaty of the Holy Alliance and preserved in the\r\nRussian State Archives, affords a clear instance of the direction of\r\npolitics at that time.\r\n\r\n[59] [Skrine[l] says, however: “For nearly half a century the Holy\r\nAlliance was the keystone of the edifice erected at Vienna, the hidden\r\nchain which linked Russia with the other military powers.”]\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X. ALEXANDER I, MYSTIC AND HUMANITARIAN\r\n\r\n    Heaven grant that we may one day attain our aim of making\r\n    Russia free and of preserving her from despotism and\r\n    tyranny. This is my unique desire, and I willingly sacrifice\r\n    all my labours and my life to the aim that is so dear to\r\n    me.--ALEXANDER I.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE COMPLEX CHARACTER OF ALEXANDER I\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [1801-1825 A.D.]]\r\n\r\nIn the preceding chapter, we followed the history of the external affairs\r\nof Russia during fourteen years of the reign of Alexander I. Now we shall\r\nwitness the incidents of that monarch’s later years, and, in particular,\r\nshall consider the internal condition of Russia during the reign of\r\none of the most interesting of sovereigns. Clearly to appreciate the\r\ncomplex character of the reigns, we may follow Shilder, partly by way of\r\nrecapitulation, in dividing it into three periods, each of which seems to\r\nrepresent a phase of the mental evolution of Alexander.[a]\r\n\r\nThe first period embraces the time between the years 1801 and 1810, and\r\nis usually designated as the epoch of reforms, but as we penetrate more\r\ndeeply into the spirit of that period, we come to the conclusion that\r\nit might more justly be termed the epoch of vacillations. Actually, at\r\nthis time, that is from 1801 to 1810, ceaseless vacillations took place\r\nin the governmental life of Russia, both in regard to the outward as\r\nwell as the inward policy of the empire; throughout every branch of the\r\nadministration of the state an entire instability of views and brusque\r\nchanges from one political system to another were to be observed. All\r\nthese manifestations were conditional exclusively on the personality\r\nof the emperor Alexander, who possessed the characteristic of not\r\nunfrequently vacillating at short intervals between two entirely opposed\r\nframes of mind, without reference to the direction he had elected to\r\nfollow.\r\n\r\nThe second period is continued from 1810 to 1816 and in its inner\r\nsignification is entirely concentrated in the struggle with France. This\r\nperiod in contrast to the preceding, is distinguished by the pursuit\r\nof one ruling idea, carried out with remarkable consecutiveness to the\r\nend, an instance which is almost unique in the whole reign of Alexander.\r\nUnexpectedly to all, to the astonishment of the whole world, in 1812,\r\nhe showed himself immovable and decided to be or not to be. Meanwhile\r\nNapoleon, preparing himself for the invasion of Russia, had based\r\nhis political and military calculations upon the imaginary weakness\r\nof Alexander’s character, and in this respect the conqueror’s hidden\r\nthoughts corresponded with the secret calculations of his allies,\r\nMetternich and Hardenburg. All these three enemies of Russia were however\r\ndestined to experience complete disenchantment. The ruling idea of\r\nAlexander, which he then steadfastly followed, consisted in the overthrow\r\nof Napoleon. [These two periods we have covered in the preceding chapter,\r\nbut we shall have occasion to revert to certain phases and incidents of\r\ntheir development.]\r\n\r\nThe third period, beginning from the year 1816, finishes with the death\r\nof the emperor Alexander in 1825. Historians usually call it the period\r\nof congresses and of the preservation of order in Europe established by\r\nthem. It would be more exact and nearer to the truth to call this last\r\ndecade the period of reaction.\r\n\r\nAfter the overthrow of Napoleon the emperor Alexander appears as a weary\r\nmartyr, wavering between the growing influence of Araktcheiev and his\r\nown personal convictions which he had adopted in the days of his youth.\r\nAmongst the reactionary measures which commenced in 1816 there can still\r\nbe traced bright gleams of the enthusiasms and dreams of his youth. The\r\nspeech pronounced in 1818 by the emperor at the opening of the Polish\r\ndiet testifies to this. But from the year 1820 a complete vanishing of\r\nall the previous ideals to the realisation of which he had once aspired\r\nwith sincere enthusiasm, is to be observed. To this moral condition\r\nwas also united an incurable weariness of life, the signs of which had\r\nalready been observed in the emperor Alexander by Metternich at the\r\ncongress of Verona in 1822.\r\n\r\nAs we enter upon a closer analysis of the three periods into which\r\nwe have divided this reign, we remark another curious feature in the\r\ndevelopment of Alexander. Metternich calls this phenomenon that of the\r\nperiodic evolutions of the emperor’s mind (_les évolutions périodiques de\r\nson esprit_). The phenomenon was repeated with striking regularity about\r\nevery five years of his reign. Assimilating to himself any idea with\r\nwhich he was inspired, Alexander gave himself up to it, unhesitatingly\r\nand with full enthusiasm. The incubation required about two years, during\r\nwhich the idea acquired for him the importance of a system; the third\r\nyear he remained faithful to the system chosen, he became more and more\r\nattached to it, he listened with real enthusiasm to its upholders and\r\nat such a time was inaccessible to any influence that might shake the\r\njustness of the views he had adopted. The fourth year he grew disturbed\r\nat the consequences which might possibly arise; the fifth year there\r\nbecame observable a medley of the old and vanishing system with some new\r\nidea which was beginning to take birth in his mind. This idea was usually\r\ndiametrically opposed to the one that had left his horizon. After that,\r\nwhen he had assimilated the new convictions, he did not preserve any\r\nremembrance of the ideas he had abandoned, beyond the obligations which\r\nbound him to the various representatives of the former views.[b]\r\n\r\n\r\nMINISTERIAL INFLUENCES; SPERANSKI AND ARAKTCHEIEV\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [1801-1815 A.D.]]\r\n\r\nFrom 1806 to 1812 the preponderating influence over Alexander I was\r\nthat of Speranski. Son of a village priest, educated in a seminary, and\r\nafterwards professor of mathematics and philosophy in the seminary of\r\nAlexander Nevski, Speranski became preceptor to the children of Alexis\r\nKurakin, thanks to whom he quitted the ecclesiastical for a civil\r\ncareer, and became secretary to Trochtchinski, who was then chancellor\r\nof the imperial council. Later, after he had become director of the\r\ndepartment of the interior under Prince Kotchubei, Speranski rose to\r\nthe position of secretary of state and gained the complete confidence\r\nof the emperor. The favourites of the preceding period had all been\r\nimbued with English ideas; Speranski, on the contrary, loved France\r\nand manifested a particular admiration for Napoleon. These French\r\nsympathies, shared at the time by Alexander I, formed a new bond between\r\nthe prince and the minister which was not severed until the rupture with\r\nNapoleon. “We know,” said Monsieur Bogdanovitch, “Alexander’s fondness\r\nfor representative forms and a constitutional government, but this taste\r\nresembles that of a dilettante who goes into ecstacies over a fine\r\npainting. Alexander early convinced himself that neither Russia’s vast\r\nextent nor the constitution of civil society would permit the realisation\r\nof his dream. From day to day he deferred the execution of his utopian\r\nideas, but delighted to discourse with his intimates upon the projected\r\nconstitution and the disadvantages of absolutism. To please the emperor,\r\nSperanski ardently defended the principles of liberty, and by so doing\r\nexposed himself to accusations of anarchy and of having conceived\r\nprojects dangerous to institutions that had received the consecration\r\nof time and custom.” Painstaking, learned, and profoundly patriotic and\r\nhumane, he was the man best able to realise all that was practicable in\r\nthe ideas of Alexander.\r\n\r\nSperanski presented to the sovereign a systematic plan of reform. The\r\nimperial council received an extension of privileges. Composed as it\r\nwas of the chief dignitaries of the state, it became in a measure the\r\nlegislative power, and had the duty of examining new laws, extraordinary\r\nmeasures, and ministerial reports; it was in reality a sketch of a\r\nrepresentative government. After the interview at Erfurt, during which\r\nNapoleon had showed him marked attention, Speranski entered into\r\nrelations with the French legal writers, Locré, Legras, Dupont de\r\nNemours, and made them correspondents of the legislative commission of\r\nthe imperial council. The Code Napoleon was not adapted to any but a\r\nhomogeneous nation emancipated from personal and feudal servitude, with a\r\npopulation whose members all enjoyed a certain equality before the law.\r\nThus to Speranski the emancipation of the serfs was the corner-stone\r\nof regeneration. He dreamed of instituting a third estate, of limiting\r\nthe number of privileged classes, and of forming the great aristocratic\r\nfamilies into a peerage similar to that of England. He encouraged Count\r\nStroinovski to publish his pamphlet, _Rules to be Observed between\r\nProprietors and Serfs_. As early as 1809 he had decided that the holders\r\nof university degrees should have the advantage over all others in\r\nattaining the degrees of the _tchin_. Thus a doctor would at once enter\r\nthe eighth rank, a master of arts the ninth, a candidate the tenth, and a\r\nbachelor the twelfth.\r\n\r\nLike Turgot, the minister of Louis XVIII, and the Prussian reformer,\r\nStein, Speranski had aroused the hostility of everyone. The nobility\r\nof court and ante-chamber, and all the young officials who wished to\r\nrise by favour alone were exasperated by the ukase of 1809; proprietors\r\nwere alarmed at Speranski’s project for the emancipation of the serfs;\r\nthe senators were irritated by his plans for reorganisation which would\r\nreduce the first governing body of the empire to the position of a\r\nsupreme court of justice; and the high aristocracy was incensed at the\r\nboldness of a man of low condition, the son of a village priest. The\r\npeople themselves complained at the increase in taxation, all those whose\r\ninterests had been set aside united against the upstart; he was accused\r\nof despising the time-honoured institutions of Moscow and of having\r\npresented as a model to the Russians the Code Napoleon when the country\r\nwas on the eve of war with France. The ministers Balachev, Armfelt,\r\nGuriev, Count Rostoptchin, Araktcheiev, and the grand duchess Catherine\r\nPavlovna, sister of the emperor, influenced Alexander against him.\r\nKaramzin, the historian, addressed to the emperor an impassioned memoir\r\non _New and Old Russia_, in which he stepped forth as the champion of\r\nserfdom, of the old laws, and of autocracy. Speranski’s enemy even went\r\nto the length of denouncing him as a traitor and an accomplice of France.\r\nIn March, 1812, he was suddenly sent from the capital to Nijni-Novgorod\r\nand afterwards deported to a distant post where he was subjected to\r\nclose surveillance. He was recalled in 1819, when passions had somewhat\r\ncooled, and was appointed governor of Siberia. In 1821 he returned to St.\r\nPetersburg, but did not recover his former position.\r\n\r\nA new epoch now set in. The adversaries of Speranski, Armfelt, Schichkov,\r\nand Rostoptchin attained high positions, but the acknowledged favourite\r\nwas Araktcheiev, the rough “corporal of Gachina,” born enemy to progress\r\nand reform and apostle of absolute dominion and passive obedience. He\r\ngained the confidence of Alexander, first by his devotion to the memory\r\nof Paul, next by his punctuality, his unquestioning obedience, his\r\ndisinterestedness and habits of industry, and lastly by his ingenuous\r\nadmiration for the “genius of the emperor.” He was the most trustworthy\r\nof servitors, the most imperious of superiors, and the most perfect\r\ninstrument for a reaction. His influence was not at once exclusive. After\r\nhaving conquered Napoleon, Alexander looked upon himself as the liberator\r\nof nations. He had set Germany free; he dealt leniently with France and\r\nobtained for it a charter; he granted a constitution to Poland, with the\r\nintention of extending its benefit to Russia. Though the censorship of\r\nthe press had recently forbidden the _Viestnik slovesnosti_ to criticise,\r\n“the servants of his majesty,” Alexander had not entirely renounced his\r\nutopian ideas. English Protestant influence succeeded to the influence of\r\nFrance; French theatres were closed and Bible societies opened.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, this first period of favour for Araktcheiev soon became an\r\nepoch of sterility; though reaction had not yet set in there had at least\r\ncome a decided pause. The reforms interrupted by the war of 1812 were not\r\nto be again resumed. The code of Speranski had come to an end and all\r\nefforts to compile one better suited to Russian traditions were of no\r\navail.[f]\r\n\r\n\r\nEDUCATIONAL ADVANCES; THE LYCÉE AND THE LIBRARY\r\n\r\nOn the 23rd of January of the year 1811 was promulgated the statute of\r\nthe lycée of Tsarskoi Selo, which had been definitely worked out by\r\nsecretary of state Speranski. The aim of the establishment of the lycée\r\nwas the education of young men, and chiefly of those who were destined\r\nto fill the most important posts of the government service. The following\r\ncircumstance was the primary cause of the foundation of this higher\r\neducational establishment: although the emperor did not interfere in the\r\nmatter of the education of his younger brothers, the grand dukes Nicholas\r\nand Michael Pavlovitch, which was entirely left to the empress, Marie\r\nFeodorovna, a case soon presented itself where the emperor recognised\r\nthe necessity of departing from the rule he had established. The widowed\r\nempress desired to send her sons to the university of Leipsic for the\r\ncompletion of their studies; this was, however, firmly opposed by the\r\nemperor, and instead he had the idea of establishing a lycée at Tsarskoi\r\nSelo, where his younger brothers could assist at the public lectures.\r\nA wing of the palace connected by a gallery with the chief building,\r\nwas adapted to this purpose, and the solemn opening of the Tsarskoi\r\nSelo lycée took place on the 31st of October, 1811, in the presence of\r\nthe emperor Alexander. It commenced with a thanksgiving service in the\r\ncourt chapel of Tsarskoi Selo, after which those present accompanied\r\nthe clergy who made the tour of the edifice, sprinkling it with holy\r\nwater. At the conclusion of the ecclesiastical ceremony, the imperial\r\ncharter given to the lycée was read in the hall of the building, and\r\nthe speeches began. Amongst them that of the adjunct professor Kunitzin\r\nearned the special approbation of the emperor for the art with which it\r\navoided generalisations and dwelt on the beneficence of the founder. In\r\nconclusion, Alexander inspected the premises allotted to the students,\r\nand was present at their dinner table.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: TOWER OF IVAN VELIKA, MOSCOW]\r\n\r\nThe year 1811 was also signalised by the completion of the building\r\nof the Kazan cathedral, the first stone of which had been laid by the\r\nemperor Alexander on the 8th of September, 1801. The constructor of the\r\ncathedral was the Russian architect Andrew Nikivorovitch Voroniknin.\r\nThe building committee was under the direction of the president of the\r\nAcademy of Arts, Count Alexander Stroganov. The building of the cathedral\r\ntook ten years, and on the 27th of September, 1811, on the anniversary of\r\nthe emperor’s coronation, the solemn consecration of the new cathedral\r\ntook place in the presence of the emperor. Count Stroganov was that day\r\nelevated to the dignity of actual privy councillor of the first rank. He\r\nwas not destined to enjoy for long the completion of his work: ten days\r\nlater he died.\r\n\r\nIn the very thick of the preparations for war, and amidst such agitating\r\npolitical circumstances as had been unknown till then, the emperor\r\nAlexander continued to labour for the enlightenment of his subjects.\r\nNotable among his acts at this time was the foundation of a public\r\nlibrary. Catherine II’s idea of founding in the capital a library for\r\ngeneral use, and of rendering it accessible to all, was only brought to\r\nfulfilment by Alexander. A special edifice was built with this object;\r\nits construction had been already commenced during Catherine’s reign.\r\nBy 1812 all the preliminary work in the building of this library was\r\ncompleted, and on the 14th of January the emperor honoured the newly\r\nconstructed library with a visit, and examined in detail all its\r\ncuriosities. Following on this the “draft of detailed rules for the\r\nadministration of the Imperial Public Library” was ratified by his\r\nmajesty on the 7th of March.\r\n\r\nThe events of 1812, however, deferred the actual opening of the library:\r\nsoon measures had to be thought of to save its treasures. The opening\r\nceremony took place, therefore, two years later, in 1814, on the 14th\r\nof January, the anniversary of the day on which the emperor Alexander\r\nmade his gracious visit to the library, on the memorable occasion of its\r\nfounding.\r\n\r\nA great many festivities took place at the Russian court upon the\r\noccasion of the marriage of the grand duke Nicholas Pavlovitch with the\r\nprincess Charlotte of Prussia (July 13th, 1817). About the same time\r\n(July 31st, 1817), a modest festival was celebrated at Tsarskoi Selo--the\r\nfirst distribution of prizes to students of the lycée. On that day the\r\nemperor Alexander, accompanied by Prince A. N. Galitzin, was present\r\nin the conference hall of the institution he had founded; he himself\r\ndistributed the prizes and certificates to the pupils, and after having\r\nannounced the awards to be given to them and their teachers he left,\r\nbidding a fatherly farewell to all. The poet Pushkin was amongst the\r\nstudents who took part in the festival.\r\n\r\n\r\nEXPULSION OF THE JESUITS FROM ST. PETERSBURG\r\n\r\nThe year 1815, which had been filled with a series of unexpected events,\r\nterminated with an important administrative measure which no one had\r\nforeseen. On the 18th of January, 1817, an imperial ukase was issued\r\nordering the immediate expulsion of all the monks of the order of Jesuits\r\nfrom St. Petersburg, and at the same time forbidding their entry into\r\neither of the two capitals. In the middle of the night they were provided\r\nwith fur cloaks, and warm boots, and despatched in carts to the residence\r\nof their brethren at Polotsk.[60] It was enjoined in this ukase that the\r\nCatholic church in St. Petersburg should be “placed on the same footing\r\nthat had been established during the reign of the empress Catherine\r\nII and which had endured up to the year 1800.” This expulsion put an\r\nend to the pedagogical activity of the Jesuits in St. Petersburg. The\r\nwords of N. J. Turgeniev, spoken in the year 1812 and addressed to his\r\nsuccessor Gruber, the Berezovski Jesuit, were, in fact, realised for\r\nthe order in the most unpleasant way. He said: “This is the beginning\r\nof the end; you will now do so much that you will be sent away.” The\r\ngovernment was compelled to have recourse to decisive measures in view\r\nof cases of conversion to Catholicism amongst the orthodox pupils of the\r\nJesuit school in St. Petersburg; besides which the influence of Jesuit\r\npropaganda was spreading in a remarkable way amongst the ladies of the\r\nhigh society of St. Petersburg.\r\n\r\nThis measure, however, did not put a limit to the misfortunes that\r\ndescended upon the Jesuits during the reign of Alexander. A few years\r\nlater (on the 25th of March, 1820) the order was given that the Jesuits\r\nshould be expelled finally from Russia, adding that they were not under\r\nany aspect or denomination to be allowed to return; and at the same time\r\nthe Polotsk academy was suppressed, as well as all the schools depending\r\non it.\r\n\r\n\r\nLIBERATION OF THE PEASANTS OF THE BALTIC PROVINCES (1816-1818 A.D.)\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [1816-1818 A.D.]]\r\n\r\nThe nobility of Esthonia had in 1811 announced their desire of giving\r\nup their rights of servitude over their peasants. In the year 1816\r\nthis intention led to the confirmation of the establishment of the\r\nEsthonian peasants upon a new footing, according to which the individual\r\nright of servitude was abolished. The nobility kept the land as their\r\nproperty, and the relations between the peasants and the landowners were\r\nfrom thenceforth based upon mutual agreement by free will contracts\r\nconformable with rules determining essential conditions; a period of\r\ntransition was appointed for bringing in the new order of things. After\r\nthe first trial, the individual, landless liberation of the peasants\r\nspread throughout the Baltic provinces and in other governments--namely,\r\nin Courland in 1817 and in Livonia in 1819. The introduction of the\r\nnew order of things was everywhere accomplished without any particular\r\ndifficulty.\r\n\r\nIn expressing to the Livonian nobility his satisfaction upon the occasion\r\nof the reform effectuated, the emperor Alexander said: “I rejoice that\r\nthe Livonian nobility has justified my expectations. Your example\r\ndeserves imitation. You have acted in accordance with the spirit of the\r\ntimes and have understood that liberal principles alone can serve as\r\na basis for the happiness of nations.” From these words it is evident\r\nthat the emperor entertained, according to Shishkov’s expression, an\r\nunfortunate prejudice against the right of servitude in Russia, and\r\nit appeared to many that in other parts of the empire words would be\r\nfollowed by deeds.[61]\r\n\r\nFrom the year 1816, the peasant question began to occupy society. The\r\naide-de-camp of his majesty, Kisselev, even presented a memoir to the\r\nemperor which bore the title _Of the Gradual Abolition of Slavery\r\nin Russia_. The memoir began with the words: “Civic liberty is the\r\nfoundation of national prosperity. This truth is so undoubted that I\r\nconsider it superfluous here to explain how desirable it is that the\r\nlawful independence of which serfs and agriculturists, are unjustly\r\ndeprived, should be established for them throughout the empire. I\r\nconsider this measure the more needful now that the progress of\r\nenlightenment and our closer contact with Europe, which hourly increases\r\nthe fermentation of minds, indicate to the government the necessity of\r\naverting the consequences which may follow, and whose menace it would be\r\nalready difficult or impossible to deny. The blood in which the French\r\nRevolution was steeped bears witness to this.” In what manner the emperor\r\nAlexander regarded the memoir presented by his aide-de-camp, and what\r\nfate overtook this production of his pen has remained unknown.\r\n\r\nP. D. Kisselev was not the only nobleman who recognised the urgent\r\nnecessity of the government’s occupying itself with the peasant question.\r\nThe following circumstance serves as a proof of this: in this same year,\r\n1816, many of the richest landowners of the government of St. Petersburg,\r\nknowing the emperor’s moral aspirations to better the lot of the peasant\r\nserfs, decided to turn them into obligatory settlers upon the basis\r\nof the then existing regulations. The act was drawn up and signed by\r\nsixty-five landowners; it only remained to take it to be ratified by the\r\nemperor, and for this purpose the general aide-de-camp J. V. Vasiltchikov\r\nwas chosen. Those who had taken part in the signature of the act supposed\r\nthat the emperor knew nothing of the meetings that had taken place on\r\nthe occasion and were convinced that he would receive graciously a\r\nproposition, which was in accordance with his manner of thinking. But the\r\nemperor Alexander was aware of the determination of the nobles and hardly\r\nhad Vasiltchikov, after requesting permission to present himself to his\r\nmajesty, begun to speak of the matter, when Alexander, interrupting\r\nhim, inquired: “To whom, in your opinion, does the legislative power\r\nbelong in Russia?” And when Vasiltchikov replied: “Without doubt to your\r\nimperial majesty as an autocratic emperor,” Alexander, raising his voice,\r\nsaid, “Then leave it to me to promulgate such laws as I consider most\r\nbeneficial to my subjects.”\r\n\r\nThe emperor’s reply gave little hope of a favourable solution of this\r\nimportant question. In the then existing state of affairs, the matter\r\ncould not avoid passing through the hands of Araktcheiev. This indeed\r\nactually happened. In February, 1818, before the departure of the emperor\r\nAlexander from Moscow for Warsaw to open the first Polish diet, Count\r\nAraktcheiev announced that his majesty had deigned to issue an edict for\r\nthe liberation of landowners’ peasants from the condition of serfdom,\r\nwith the stipulation that the edict should not in any of its measures be\r\noppressive to the landowners, and especially that it should not present\r\nanything of a violent character in its accomplishment on the part of\r\nthe government: but, on the contrary, that it should be accompanied by\r\nadvantages for the landowners and awaken in them a desire to co-operate\r\nwith the government in the abolition of the conditions of serfdom in\r\nRussia, an abolition corresponding to the spirit of the times and the\r\nprogress of education, and indispensable for the future tranquillity of\r\nthe possessors of serfs.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE EMPEROR AND THE QUAKERS\r\n\r\nIn 1814, at the time of the emperor Alexander’s stay in London, the\r\nfamous philanthropist Quakers, De Grelle de Mobillier,[62] and Allen, had\r\nbeen inspired with the idea of taking advantage of a favourable occasion,\r\nand instilling into the minds of the allied sovereigns the conviction\r\nthat the kingdom of Christ is a kingdom of justice and truth. With this\r\nobject they first set off to visit the king of Prussia, who received\r\nthem and praised the Quakers living in his dominions, but expressed his\r\nconviction that war is indispensable for the attainment of peace. The\r\nemperor Alexander showed them more sympathy; he visited a Quaker meeting\r\nand received a deputation. The emperor assured the Quakers that he was in\r\nagreement with the greater part of their opinions, and that although on\r\naccount of his exceptional position his mode of action must be other than\r\ntheirs, yet he was in union with them in the spiritual worship of Christ.\r\nIn taking leave of the Quakers, Alexander invited them to come to see him\r\nin Russia and said: “I bid you farewell as a friend and brother.”\r\n\r\nGrelle and Allen arrived in St. Petersburg in November, 1818, during\r\nthe emperor’s absence. They went to Prince A. N. Galitzin, of whom\r\nGrelle wrote: “He is a man penetrated by a truly Christian spirit.”\r\nGalitzin received the Quakers with an open heart and informed them that\r\nthe emperor had sent him a letter telling him of their coming to Russia\r\nand requesting that they might be received as his friends. After various\r\nquestions upon religious matters the Quakers, together with Prince\r\nGalitzin, gave themselves up to silent, inward meditation, and this\r\nmethod, writes Grelle, “did not appear at all unknown to the prince.\r\nInspired by the love of Christ, we felt in ourselves, after silent,\r\nheartfelt prayer, the beneficent moving of grace. In taking leave of the\r\nprince, he offered us free access to all that could interest us--to the\r\nprisons, to reformatory institutions, and to refuges for the poor.”\r\n\r\nTheir visit to the St. Petersburg prisons deeply agitated the pious\r\nQuakers; according to Grelle’s observations, some of them were very\r\ndirty and overrun with vermin; the odour was unbearable and the air\r\ncontaminated to such a degree that it affected the heads and lungs of the\r\nvisitors. The Quakers also inspected a few refuges and schools.\r\n\r\nOn a subsequent evening the emperor Alexander received the Quakers alone.\r\nHe called them his old friends, made them sit beside him on the sofa, and\r\ncalled to mind with inward emotion their interview in London in 1814,\r\nsaying that it had given him the spirit of courage and firmness amidst\r\nall the difficult circumstances in which he was then placed. “The emperor\r\nthen,” writes Grelle, “suggested to us some questions upon religious\r\nmatters, thus showing his sincere desire to progress in the saving\r\nknowledge of truth. He further questioned us as to what we had seen and\r\ndone in Russia. We took advantage of the opportunity to relate to him\r\nthe distressing condition of the prisons; and in particular we directed\r\nhis attention to the wretched state of the prison in Åbo, and told him\r\nabout an unfortunate man who had been kept in irons there for nineteen\r\nyears. The emperor was touched by our narrative and said, ‘This ought not\r\nto be; it shall not occur again.’” The Quakers also informed the emperor\r\nhow deeply grieved they had been to see, upon inspecting one of the\r\nschools, that the pupils were given books to read that were pernicious\r\nto their morals; after which they showed him a specimen of extracts they\r\nhad made from the Holy Scriptures for the use of schools. The emperor\r\nremained wrapped in thought for a moment, and then turning to his\r\ncompanions, he observed: “You have done precisely what I much desired. I\r\nhave often thought that schools might serve as a powerful instrument for\r\nthe furtherance of the kingdom of Christ, by leading the people to the\r\nknowledge of the Saviour and the principles of true piety. Send me as\r\nsoon as possible all that you have succeeded in preparing.”\r\n\r\nThe conversation then touched on Daniel Villers, also a Quaker, whom the\r\nemperor had called to St. Petersburg to drain the marshes; Alexander said\r\nthat he regarded his presence in Russia as a blessing to the people.\r\n“It was not the draining of the marshes,” added the emperor, “nor any\r\nother material necessity that was the cause of my inviting some of your\r\n‘friends’ to come here; no, I was guided by the wish that their true\r\npiety, their probity, and other virtues might serve as an example for my\r\npeople to imitate.”\r\n\r\nIn conclusion the emperor said, “Before we separate, let us try to spend\r\nsome time in common prayer.” “We willingly consented,” writes Grelle in\r\nregard to this matter, “feeling that the Lord with his beneficent power\r\nwas near us. Some time passed in silent, inward contemplation; our souls\r\nwere humbled, and a little later I felt within me the heavenly breathing\r\nof the spirit of prayer and compunction; enfolded by the spirit, I bent\r\nmy knees before the greatness of God; the emperor knelt beside me. Amidst\r\nthe inward outpourings of the soul we felt that the Lord had consented\r\nto hear our prayers. After that we spent a little while longer in silence\r\nand then withdrew. In bidding us farewell the emperor expressed the\r\ndesire to see us again before we left. We spent two hours with him.”\r\n\r\nAfter this remarkable audience, which so graphically expresses the\r\nreligious-idealistic frame of mind of the emperor Alexander, the Quakers\r\nvisited under the patronage of the widowed empress the female educational\r\nestablishments, the young pupils of which aroused much sympathy in them.\r\nGrelle found that some of them had hearts open for receiving evangelical\r\ninspiration. These visits were followed by the reception of the Quakers\r\nby the empress Marie Feodorovna. They told the empress that they were\r\nmuch pleased at the condition of the institutions under her patronage,\r\nbut at the same time they could not be otherwise than grieved to see how\r\nlittle attention was paid in St. Petersburg, and in general throughout\r\nRussia, to the education of children of the lower classes; they also\r\nspoke to the empress of the unsatisfactoriness of the then existing\r\nprison accommodations for women, and indicated how advantageous it would\r\nbe if the prisons were visited by women capable of instructing and\r\nconsoling the unfortunate prisoners. The empress entirely agreed with\r\nthese ideas.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: RUSSIAN PRIEST]\r\n\r\nSoon the emperor again invited the Quakers to come and see him. “He again\r\nreceived us in his private apartments,” writes Grelle, “to which we\r\nwere taken by a secret way, avoiding the guard and the court servants.\r\nNobody seemed surprised to see us keeping our heads covered. The emperor,\r\nas before, received us with sincere affability. He began by informing\r\nus that the chains in which we had seen the prisoners at Åbo had been\r\ntaken off, that the unfortunate man of whom we had told him had been\r\nset at liberty, and that orders had been given that the other prisoners\r\nwere to be better treated. He then asked us to relate to him openly\r\nall that we had noticed in the prisons during our stay in Russia. The\r\ngovernor-general (Count Miloradovitch) had informed him of the changes\r\nand improvements which he considered it advantageous to carry out in the\r\ngaols, and the emperor entirely approved of the changes that had already\r\nbeen made. He further told us that the widowed empress had spoken to\r\nhim with pleasure of our visit to her; that she had taken to heart what\r\nwe had said of the extreme neglect of the education of children of the\r\npoorer classes, and that she was occupying herself in searching for the\r\nmost effectual measures of remedying this defect as soon as possible. The\r\nemperor added that he had named a certain sum of money to be used for\r\nthe establishment of six schools for poor children in the capital, and\r\nthat the children were to receive there a religious and moral education.\r\nHe further told us that he had attentively perused the books we had\r\nprepared and was delighted with them; that if we had only come to Russia\r\nto do this, we had already accomplished a very important work, and that\r\nhe intended to bring our books into use throughout all the schools of his\r\nempire.”\r\n\r\nBefore their departure for Moscow the emperor received his old friends\r\na third time, and on this occasion he related to them various details\r\nof how he had himself been educated under the supervision of his\r\ngrandmother, the empress Catherine. “The persons attached to me,” said\r\nhe, “had some good qualities, but they were not believing Christians and\r\ntherefore my primary education was not united with any profound moral\r\nimpressions; in accordance with the customs of our church, I was taught\r\nformally to repeat morning and evening certain prayers I had learned; but\r\nthis habit, which did not in any wise satisfy the inward requirements of\r\nmy religious feelings, soon wearied me. Meanwhile it happened more than\r\nonce that, when I lay down to rest, I had a lively feeling in my soul of\r\nmy sins, and of the various moral deficiencies of my mode of life; thus\r\npenetrated by heartfelt repentance I was moved by a desire to rise from\r\nmy bed and in the silence of the night to throw myself upon my knees and\r\nwith tears ask God for forgiveness and for strength to preserve greater\r\nwatchfulness over myself in future. This contrition of heart continued\r\nfor some time; but little by little, in the absence of moral support\r\non the part of the persons who surrounded me, I began to feel more\r\nseldom and more feebly these salutary movings of grace. Sin, together\r\nwith worldly distractions, began to reign more and more within my soul.\r\nFinally, in 1812, the Lord in his love and mercy, again called to me, and\r\nthe former movings of grace were renewed with fresh strength in my heart.\r\nAt that period a certain pious person[63] advised me to take to reading\r\nthe Holy Scriptures and gave me a Bible, a book which until then I had\r\nnever had in my hands. I devoured the Bible finding that its words shed\r\na new and never previously experienced peace in my heart, and satisfied\r\nthe thirst of my soul. The Lord in his goodness granted me his Spirit to\r\nunderstand what I read; and to this inward instruction and enlightenment\r\nI owe all the spiritual good that I acquired by the reading of the divine\r\nWord; this is why I look upon inward enlightenment or instruction from\r\nthe Holy Ghost as the firmest support in the soul--saving knowledge of\r\nGod.”\r\n\r\nThe emperor then related to his companions how deeply his soul was\r\npenetrated with the desire to abolish forever wars and bloodshed upon\r\nearth. “He said,” writes Grelle, “that he had passed many nights without\r\nsleep in strained and intense deliberation as to how this sacred desire\r\ncould be realised, and in deep grief at the thought of the innumerable\r\ncalamities and misfortunes that are occasioned by war. At that time\r\nwhen his soul was thus bowed down in ardent prayer to the Saviour the\r\nidea arose in him of inviting the crowned heads to unite in one holy\r\nalliance, before the tribunal of which all future disagreements that\r\nshould arise should be settled, instead of having recourse to the sword\r\nand to bloodshed. This idea took such possession of him that he got up\r\nfrom his bed, expounded his feelings and aspirations in writing with such\r\nliveliness and ardour that his intentions were subjected on the part of\r\nmany to unmerited suspicion and misinterpretation--‘Although,’ added\r\nhe with a sigh, ‘ardent love for God and mankind was the sole motive\r\nthat governed me.’ Thoughts of the formation of the Holy Alliance again\r\narose in him during his stay in Paris. After we had spent some time in\r\nconversing on this important subject, the emperor said to us: ‘And thus\r\nwe part, in this world, but I firmly trust that we, being separated by\r\nspace, will however remain by the goodness of the spirit of God forever\r\nunited through inward spiritual fellowship, for in the kingdom of God\r\nthere are no limitations of space. Now, before we part, I have one\r\nrequest to make to you: let us join in silent prayer and see if the Lord\r\nwill not consent to manifest his gracious presence to us, as he did the\r\nlast time.’\r\n\r\n“We gladly consented to fulfil his desire. A solemn silence followed\r\nduring which we felt that the Lord was amongst us; our souls were\r\nreverently opened before him and he himself was working within us through\r\nhis grace. Somewhat later, I felt, through the breathing of the love of\r\nChrist, the lively desire of saying a few words of approbation to our\r\nbeloved emperor in order to encourage him to walk with firm steps in\r\nthe Lord’s way and to put his whole trust, unto the end of his earthly\r\njourneyings, in the efficaciousness of the divine grace; in general I\r\nfelt the necessity of guarding him from evil and strengthening him in his\r\ngood intention of ever following the path of truth and righteousness. The\r\nwords that I said produced a profound impression upon the emperor and\r\nhe shed burning tears. Then our dear Allen, kneeling, raised a fervent\r\nprayer to God for the emperor and his people. The emperor himself fell\r\non his knees beside him and remained a long while with us in spiritual\r\noutpourings before the Lord. Finally we solemnly and touchingly took\r\nleave of each other.”\r\n\r\n\r\nSECRET SOCIETIES UNDER ALEXANDER I\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A VALDAI WOMAN]\r\n\r\nAfter the year 1815, when the emperor Alexander already appeared as a\r\nweary martyr, immersed in mystic contemplation and wavering between\r\nthe evergrowing influence of Count Araktcheiev and the convictions he\r\nhad himself formed in the days of his youth, the events of 1812 were\r\nreflected in a totally different manner upon the movement of social ideas\r\nin Russia. The war of the fatherland was accompanied in Russia by an\r\nunusual rising of the spirit of the nation and a remarkable awakening of\r\nthe public conscience. The continuation of the struggle with Napoleon\r\nbeyond the frontiers of Russia had led Alexander’s troops to Paris. This\r\nenforced military exploit widened the horizon of the Russian people; they\r\nbecame acquainted with European manners and customs, were in closer\r\ncontact with the current of European thought, and felt drawn towards\r\npolitical judgment. It was quite natural that the Russian people should\r\nbegin to compare the order of things in their own country with political\r\nand public organisation abroad. An unrestrainable impulse to criticise\r\nand compare was awakened; thenceforth it was difficult to become\r\nreconciled to the former status of Russian life and the traditional order\r\nof things.\r\n\r\nIt will be asked what abuses presented themselves to the gaze of the\r\nRussian conquerors, who had liberated Europe, upon their return to their\r\ncountry. An entire absence of respect for the rights of the individual\r\nwas patent; the forcible introduction of monstrous military settlements,\r\nthe exploits of Magnitski and others of his kind in the department of\r\npublic instruction were crying shames; and, finally, the cruelties\r\nof serfdom were in full activity. The subtile exactions which then\r\nprevailed in service at the front completed the development of general\r\ndissatisfaction amongst military circles. There is, therefore, nothing\r\nastonishing in the fact that the misfortunes which then weighed upon the\r\nRussian people should have found an answering call in the hearts of men\r\nwho were at that time in the grip of a violent patriotic revival.\r\n\r\nThe natural consequence of this joyless condition of affairs in Russia\r\nwas a hidden protest, which led to the formation of secret societies.\r\nUnder the then existing conditions there was no possibility of carrying\r\non reformatory deliberations with the cognisance of the government. Thus\r\na remarkable phenomenon was accomplished; on the one hand Russian public\r\nthought was seeking for itself an issue and solution of the questions\r\nthat oppressed it; while on the other the emperor Alexander, disenchanted\r\nwith his former political ideals and standing at the head of the European\r\nreaction, had become the unexpected champion of aspirations which had\r\nnothing in common with the ideas of which he had been the representative\r\nduring the best period of his life. This circumstance made a break in\r\nthe interior life of Russia, which imperceptibly prepared the ground for\r\nevents until then unprecedented in Russian history. “What has become of\r\nliberalism?” is a question that one of the contemporaries of that epoch\r\nsets himself. “It seems to have vanished, to have disappeared from the\r\nface of the earth; everything is silent. And yet it is just at this\r\ninstant that its hidden forces have begun to grow dangerous.” The time\r\nhad come when secret societies were in full bloom. The masonic lodges,\r\nwhich had been allowed by the government, had long since accustomed the\r\nRussian nobility to the form of secret societies. Officers’ circles,\r\nin which conversations were carried on about the wounds of Russia, the\r\nobduracy of the people, the distressing position of the soldier, the\r\nindifference of society to the affairs of the country, imperceptibly\r\nchanged into organised secret societies.\r\n\r\nIt happened that yet another time the emperor Alexander expressed the\r\nconviction that the interior administration of Russia ought to be thought\r\nof, that it was necessary that means should be taken for remedying the\r\nevil; but the sovereign did not pass from words to deeds. In reference to\r\nthis, the ideas expressed by Alexander to the governor of Penza, T. P.\r\nLubianovski, on the occasion of his visit to that town in 1824 are worthy\r\nof attention. The emperor had inspected the second infantry corps there\r\nassembled; the manœuvres had deserved particular praise. Observing signs\r\nof weariness on the emperor’s face, Lubianovski ventured to remark that\r\nthe empire had reason to complain of his majesty.\r\n\r\n“Why?” “You will not take care of yourself.” “You mean to say that I am\r\ntired?” replied the emperor. “It is impossible to look at the troops\r\nwithout satisfaction; the men are good, faithful and excellently trained;\r\nwe have gained no little glory through them. Russia has enough glory; she\r\ndoes not require more; it would be a mistake to require more. But when I\r\nthink how little has been as yet done in the interior of the empire, then\r\nthe thought lies on my heart like a ten-pound weight. That is what makes\r\nme tired.”\r\n\r\nThe profoundly true thought that fell from the lips of the sovereign in\r\nhis conversation with Lubianovski was not, however, put into application.\r\nAt that period it was impossible to count upon the amendment of the state\r\nedifice through the administrations of the government. The dim figure of\r\nAraktcheiev had definitively succeeded in screening Russia from the gaze\r\nof Alexander, and his evil influence was felt at every step. Therefore\r\nin the main everything led to the sorrowful result that the emperor, as\r\nViguel expressed it, was like a gentleman who, having grown tired of\r\nadministering his own estate, had given it over entirely into the hands\r\nof a stern steward, being thus sure that the peasants would not become\r\nspoiled under him.\r\n\r\nA few words remain to be said of the fate that overtook the secret\r\nsocieties after the closing of the Alliance of the Public Good.\r\nBenkendorf’s[64] supposition that a new and more secret society would be\r\nformed after this, which would act under the veil of greater security,\r\nwas actually justified. The more zealous members of the alliance only\r\njoined together more closely, and from its ruins arose two fresh\r\nalliances--the Northern and the Southern.\r\n\r\nThe leaders of the Northern Alliance in the beginning were Muraviev and\r\nTurgeniev. Later on, in 1823, Kondratz Bileiev entered the society, of\r\nwhich he became the leader. The aspirations of the Northern Alliance\r\nwere of a constitutional-monarchic character. In the Southern Alliance,\r\nchiefly composed of members of the second army, the principal leader was\r\nthe commander of the Viatka infantry regiment, Colonel Paul Pestel, son\r\nof the former governor-general of Siberia. Thanks to Pestel’s influence\r\nthe Southern Alliance acquired a preponderating republican tendency; he\r\noccupied himself with the composition of a work which he called _Russian\r\nTruth_, in which he expounded his ideas on the reconstruction of Russia.\r\nMany members of this society inclined to the conviction that the death of\r\nthe emperor Alexander and even the extermination of the entire imperial\r\nfamily were indispensable to the successful realisation of their proposed\r\nundertakings; at any rate there is no doubt that conversations to this\r\neffect were carried on amongst the members of the secret societies.\r\nSoon the active propaganda of the members of the Southern Society\r\ncalled another society into existence--the Slavonic Alliance or the\r\nUnited Slavonians. In it was chiefly concentrated the radical element\r\nfrom the midst of the future Dekabrists. The members of this society\r\nproposed insane and violent projects and insisted chiefly on the speedy\r\ncommencement of decisive action, giving only a secondary importance to\r\ndeliberations on the constitutional form of government. Sergei Nuraviev\r\nApostol called them mad dogs chained.\r\n\r\nThere yet remained a better means for strengthening the designs of the\r\nsecret societies--this was to enter into relations with the Polish secret\r\nsocieties. Negotiations with the representative of the Polish patriotic\r\nalliance, Prince Tablonovski, were personally carried on by Pestel; but\r\nthe details of this agreement are even now little known. Such was the\r\ndangerous and fruitless path into which many of the best representatives\r\nof thinking Russia were drawn: each year the crisis became more and\r\nmore inevitable; and meanwhile the government became more decisively\r\nconfirmed than ever in the pathway of reaction, thus indirectly giving\r\ngreater power to secret revolutionary propaganda.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Closing of the Masonic Lodges_\r\n\r\nIn August, 1822, a rescript was issued in the name of the minister of the\r\ninterior, ordering the closing of all secret societies, under whatever\r\nname they might exist--masonic lodges or others--and forbidding their\r\nestablishment in future. All members of these societies had to pledge\r\nthemselves not to form any masonic lodges or other secret societies in\r\nthe future; and a declaration was required from all ranks of the army\r\nand from the civil service that neither soldiers nor officials should\r\nthenceforth belong to such organisations: “If any person refuses to make\r\nsuch a pledge, he shall no longer remain in the service.”\r\n\r\nAll the measures drawn up by the rescript of August were, however, put\r\ninto effect only with regard to the closing of the masonic lodges. As\r\nto the secret societies, which had undoubtedly a political aim, they\r\ncontinued to develop in all tranquillity. “At that time,” writes a\r\ncontemporary, “there was a triple police in St. Petersburg--namely, the\r\ngovernor general, the minister of the interior, and Count Araktcheiev;\r\nbut that it did not bring forth any advantages is proved by the events of\r\n1825.”\r\n\r\nAccording to the remarks of the same contemporary, card-playing had then\r\nspread in St. Petersburg society to an incredible degree. “Certainly\r\nin ninety houses out of a hundred they play,” writes Danilevski, “and\r\nalthough the circle of my acquaintances has become very vast this year\r\nand I go out a great deal yet I never see people doing anything else\r\nthan playing at cards. If one is invited to an evening party, it means\r\ncards, and I have hardly made my bow to the hostess before I find the\r\ncards in my hand. When one is asked out to dinner one sits down to\r\nwhist before the meal is served. Card-playing occupies not only elderly\r\npeople but young ones also. I think this has arisen partly from a\r\ndefect in education which is in general observable in Russia--for when\r\neducation finishes at seventeen, what store of ideas and knowledge, what\r\npassion for science can one expect to find in adults? This condition is\r\nfurther exaggerated by the fact that all political matters are banished\r\nfrom conversation: the government is suspicious, and spies are not\r\nunfrequently to be met with in society. The greater part of them are,\r\nhowever, known; some belong to old noble families, are decorated with\r\norders, and wear chamberlains’ keys.”\r\n\r\nThe closing of the masonic lodges called forth the following\r\ndeliberations from Danilevski: “As far as I know, masonry had no other\r\nobject in Russia beyond benevolence and providing an agreeable way of\r\npassing time. The closing of the lodges deprived us of the only places\r\nwhere we assembled for anything else besides card-playing, for we have\r\nno society where cards do not constitute the principal or rather the\r\nonly occupation. We are as yet so unversed in political matters that it\r\nis absurd for the government to fear that such subjects would furnish\r\nconversation at the masonic lodges. With us, notable persons have rarely\r\nbeen masons; at least none such have visited our lodge, which is usually\r\nfull of people of the middle class, officers, civil-service employees,\r\nartists, a very few merchants, and a large percentage of literary men.”[b]\r\n\r\nThese of course are the words of a partisan and must be taken with\r\na certain allowance. The same remark applies with full force to the\r\ntestimony of the historian Turgeniev, whose association with the secret\r\nunions has already been mentioned, and whose comments on the subject,\r\ndespite a certain bias, are full of interest. Turgeniev is speaking of\r\nthe period just following that in which the government had taken action\r\nagainst the societies.[a]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Turgeniev’s Comment on the Secret Societies._\r\n\r\nThe government contributed much [he declares] by its suspicions and\r\nprecautions, to strengthen the reports which were afloat concerning\r\nsecret societies: to them all was suspect. A species of insurrection\r\nhaving broken out in a regiment of the guards, of which the emperor was\r\nhead, the government thought they could trace it to the action of some\r\nsociety, whereas it was caused by the brutal and ridiculous conduct of a\r\nnew colonel they had placed in command. That such was their conviction\r\nthere was no doubt, because two of the officers of the insurrectionary\r\ncompanies were traduced before a council of war, and condemned, not only\r\nwithout any proof but with no specification of the crime or fault with\r\nwhich they were charged, whereas in reality neither the one nor the other\r\nofficer had ever belonged to a secret society.\r\n\r\nA rash Englishman took it into his head to go round the world and publish\r\nan account of his travels. He arrived at St. Petersburg, went over\r\nRussia, and thence to Siberia. There he was taken for a spy, and soon an\r\norder came from St. Petersburg to conduct him to the frontier. Even pious\r\nProtestant missionaries, propagating with their accustomed zeal Christian\r\nmorals among savage peoples, were suspected by the government. They were\r\nhindered in the holy warfare they desired to carry on in the farthest\r\nand least civilised regions of the empire. The powers only saw in them\r\nemissaries of European liberalism.\r\n\r\nThe public for their part did not fail to take appearances for reality.\r\nThat is the common propensity of the crowd in every country. How many\r\ntimes, before and after this epoch, might not men have been seen\r\naddressing themselves to those who were supposed to be at the head of\r\nsuch societies, and insistently asking to be admitted. In the army\r\nsubalterns thus addressed their chiefs, and old generals sought their\r\nyoung subordinates to obtain the same favour. It might have been said\r\nwith equal truth to both parties that no secret societies existed. Men’s\r\nminds, however, were all on the strain for political events. It was\r\nthought that some great change was to come soon, and everyone wanted\r\nto get an inkling of it. Restless curiosity was not the worst of the\r\ninconveniences caused to such associations. Doubtless, the evil was less\r\ndue to societies than to persons who judged them after their deceitful\r\nappearances. Perhaps it was the fault of the political order which made\r\nsecret societies necessary or, at any rate, inevitable; but it was\r\nnevertheless a serious matter which only publicity could remedy. The\r\nstrong energy of a free man would advantageously replace the trickery and\r\nrestlessness of a slave.\r\n\r\nHowever, at the epoch of which we now speak, individuals were able to\r\nagitate in various ways, but without the least result. But if such a\r\nthing as an organised secret society did exist, how is it I did not know\r\nof it--I who knew many of those called liberals? I will give convincing\r\nproof of what I here maintain; I quote the words of Pestel, a man sent\r\nto the scaffold by the government not because he had committed some\r\npolitical crime but because he was considered as the most influential of\r\nthose who were supposed to belong to secret associations. Pestel was in\r\nSt. Petersburg just as my departure was decided on. He came to see me\r\nand spoke with regret of the dissolution of the Bien Public Society. “As\r\nfor us” (the 2nd army), he said, “we have not observed the dissolution.\r\nIt would be too disheartening. We are believed to be strong and numerous;\r\nI encourage the delusion. What would be said were it known that we are\r\nbut five or six who form the association?” He ended by advising me to\r\nrenounce my journey, or, at any rate to return as soon as possible and\r\ntake up the abandoned work again. “I see quite well,” he said, “there is\r\nabsolutely nothing left here of the old society, but at your house and a\r\nfew others one can always believe in the existence of the society. Your\r\ndeparture will weaken this belief.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A TATAR WOMAN]\r\n\r\nI explained that my health forced me to leave my affairs, and that,\r\nfurthermore, I had little faith in the efficacy of secret societies. He\r\nseemed impressed by my reasoning and even agreed that I might be right on\r\nthis last point.\r\n\r\nHis attention was much occupied with certain social theories that he\r\nand some of his friends had formulated. They thought to find in me one\r\nproselyte more. But they were disappointed, and Pestel was much surprised\r\nand disconcerted. These theories, which so many ardent imaginations had\r\nadopted, were no doubt excellent in intention, but they hardly promised\r\ngreat results. The genius, or something akin to it, in a Fourier, the\r\nzeal of an Owen, the utopianism of many others, might make proselytes\r\nand excite admiration; but the dreams of such men remained but dreams\r\nalthough they sometimes touched on the sublime. Only, in default of\r\npossible realisation, these theories might help humanity by directing the\r\nattention and effort of serious men towards certain things of which they\r\nhad sufficiently appreciated the importance and utility. But to ensure\r\nthat result more imagination was required. One of the fundamental points\r\nin the theory of Pestel and his friends was a universal distribution\r\nof territory, its cultivation to be determined by a supreme authority.\r\nAt least they wanted to divide vast crown lands among those who had no\r\nproperty. What Elizabeth had guaranteed to all Englishmen--the right\r\nof being supported by the poor rates in default of other means of\r\nsubsistence--they wanted to guarantee by means of the possession or at\r\nleast the enjoyment of a certain quantity of land free for cultivation.\r\n\r\nI tried to the best of my power to refute their arguments. It was not\r\neasy. The refutation of certain theories is difficult, and there are some\r\nwhose very absurdity makes them unassailable. At last I came to think\r\nthat Pestel and his friends were far more discontented with my opposition\r\nto their social theories than with my opinions on secret societies.[d]\r\n\r\n\r\nLITERARY ACTIVITY OF THE PERIOD\r\n\r\nThe awakening of the Russian spirit was not manifested in political\r\nconspiracies alone. In science, in letters, and in art the reign of\r\nAlexander was an epoch of magnificent achievement. The intellectual like\r\nthe liberal movement no longer bore the exotic and superficial character\r\nthat had been apparent during the reign of Catherine; it penetrated to\r\nthe deepest layers of society, gained constantly in power and extent,\r\ncarried away the middle classes, and was propagated in the remotest\r\nprovinces. The movement started in 1801 had not yet ceased, although\r\nthe government failed to support the efforts it had itself aroused,\r\nand Alexander, embittered and disillusioned, had come to mistrust all\r\nintellectual manifestations. The increased severity of the censorship\r\nhad not availed to prevent the formation of learned societies; literary\r\njournals and reviews continued to multiply.\r\n\r\nDuring this period the Besieda, a literary club representing the\r\nclassical tendencies, was formed, and the romanticists, Jukovski,\r\nDachkov, Ouvarov, Pushkin, Bludov, and Prince Viazemski founded the\r\nArzamas. At St. Petersburg appeared the _Northern Post_, the _St.\r\nPetersburg Messenger_, the _Northern Messenger_, the _Northern Mercury_,\r\nthe _Messenger of Zion_, the _Beehive_, and the _Democrat_, in which\r\nlatter Kropotkov inveighed against French customs and ideas, and in the\r\n_Funeral Orison of my Dog Balabas_ congratulated the worthy animal on\r\nnever having studied in a university, or read Voltaire.\r\n\r\nLiterary activity was, as usual, greatest at Moscow, where Karamzine\r\nwas editing the _European Messenger_, Makarov the _Moscow Mercury_, and\r\nGlinka the _Russian Messenger_. In his journal Glinka endeavoured to\r\nexcite a national feeling by first putting the people on their guard\r\nagainst all foreign influence, but more particularly that of France,\r\nand then arming them against Napoleon, teaching them the doctrine of\r\nself-immolation, and letting loose the furies of the “patriotic war.”\r\nWhen the _Russian Messenger_ went out of existence after the completion\r\nof its task, the _Son of the Soil_, edited by de Gretch, took up the\r\nsame work and carried the war against Napoleon beyond the frontiers.\r\n“Taste in advance,” it cried to the conqueror, “the immortality that you\r\ndeserve; learn now the curses that posterity will shower on your name!\r\nYou sit on your throne in the midst of thunder and flame as Satan sits in\r\nhell surrounded by death, devastation, and fire!” The _Russian Invalide_\r\nwas founded in 1813 for the benefit of wounded and infirm soldiers.\r\nEven after the war-fever had somewhat subsided, and considerations less\r\nhostile to France were occupying the public mind, the literary movement\r\nstill continued.\r\n\r\nAlmost all the writers of the day took part in the crusade against\r\nGallomania and the belief in Napoleon’s omnipotence. Some had fought\r\nin the war against France and their writings were deeply tinged with\r\npatriotic feeling. Krilov, whose fables rank him not far below La\r\nFontaine, wrote comedies also. In the _School for Young Ladies_ and the\r\n_Milliner’s Shop_ he ridiculed the exaggerated taste for everything\r\nFrench. Besides his classical tragedies Ozerov wrote _Dmitri Donskoi_,\r\nin which he recalled the struggles of Russia against the Tatars, and in\r\na measure foretold the approaching conflict with a new invader. In the\r\ntragedy named after Pojarski, the hero of 1812, Kriukovski made allusions\r\nof the same order. The poet Jukovski put in verse the exploits of the\r\nRussians against Napoleon in 1806 and 1812, and Rostoptchin did not await\r\nthe great crisis before opening out on the French the vials of his wrath.\r\n\r\nViewed in general, the literature of Alexander’s period marked the\r\npassage from the imitation of ancient writers and French classicists to\r\nthe imitation of French and English masterpieces. The Besieda and the\r\nArzamas were the headquarters of two rival armies which carried on in\r\nRussia a war similar to that waged in Paris by romantic and classical\r\nschools. Schiller, Goethe, Byron, and Shakespeare were as much the\r\nfashion in Russia as in France, and created there as close an approach\r\nto a literary scandal. While Ozerov, Batiuchkov, and Derjavine upheld\r\nthe traditions of the old school, Jukovski gave to Russia a translation\r\nof Schiller’s _Joan of Arc_ and of Byron’s _Prisoner of Chillon_; and\r\nPushkin published _Ruslan and Liudmilla_, _The Prisoner of the Caucasus_,\r\n_Eugene Oniegin_, the poem _Poltava_, and the tragedy _Boris Godunov_.\r\n\r\nAs in France the romantic movement had been accompanied by a brilliant\r\nrevival of historical studies, so in Russia a fresh impulse was given\r\nto letters, and dramatists and novelists were inspired with a taste for\r\nnational subjects by Karamzin’s _History of the Russian Empire_, a work\r\nremarkable for eloquence and charm [as our various extracts testify]\r\nthough deficient in critical insight. Schlötzer had recently edited\r\nNestor, the old annalist of Kiev and father of Russian history.[f]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Alexander I as a Patron of Literature_\r\n\r\nProtection and encouragement were shown to literature by Alexander\r\nI. Storck[i] writes as follows: “Rarely has any ruler shown such\r\nencouragement to literature as Alexander I. The remarkable literary\r\nmerits of persons in the government service are rewarded by rises in the\r\nofficial ranks, by orders and pensions, whilst writers who are not in the\r\ngovernment service and whose literary productions come to the knowledge\r\nof the emperor not unfrequently receive presents of considerable value.\r\nUnder the existing conditions of the book trade, Russian authors cannot\r\nalways count on a fitting recompense for large scientific works, and in\r\nsuch cases the emperor, having regard to these circumstances, sometimes\r\ngrants the authors large sums for the publication of their works. Many\r\nwriters send their manuscripts to the emperor, and if only they have\r\na useful tendency he orders them to be printed at the expense of the\r\ncabinet and then usually gives the whole edition to the author.”\r\n\r\nIn view of the desire manifested by Karamzin to devote his labours to\r\nthe composition of a full history of the Russian Empire, the emperor by\r\na ukase of the 31st of October, 1803, bestowed upon him the title of\r\nhistoriographer and a yearly pension of 2,000 rubles.\r\n\r\nDuring the reign of the emperor Paul, Alexander, in a letter to Laharpe\r\ndated September 27th, 1797, expressed his conviction of the necessity\r\nof translating useful books into the Russian language, in order “to\r\nlay a foundation by spreading knowledge and enlightenment in the minds\r\nof the people.” When he came to the throne, Alexander did not delay in\r\naccomplishing the intention he had already formed when he was czarevitch,\r\nand actually during the epoch of reforms a multitude of translations of\r\nworks appeared, which had the evident object of inspiring interest in\r\nsocial, economic, and political questions and of communicating to Russian\r\nsociety the latest word of western science upon such questions.\r\n\r\nIn the establishment of the ministries the question of censorship was not\r\noverlooked; it was transferred to the ministry of public instruction.\r\nIn consequence of this arrangement a special statute was issued (July\r\n9th, 1804), “not in order to place any restraint,” as is stated in\r\nthe minister’s report, “upon the freedom of thought and of writing,\r\nbut solely so as to take requisite measures against the abuse of such\r\nfreedom.” The entire statute contained forty-seven paragraphs--a\r\ncircumstance worthy of attention if we take into consideration the fact\r\nthat the censorship statute presented in the year 1826 by A. S. Shishkov\r\nhad grown to 230 paragraphs. According to the statute of Alexander I the\r\ncensorship was designed chiefly to “furnish society with books and works\r\ncontributing to the true enlightenment of minds and to the formation of\r\nmoral qualities, and to remove books and works of contrary tendencies.”\r\nThe censorship was entrusted to the university, constituting in its\r\ngeneral jurisdiction the then newly organised department of the ministry\r\nof public instruction, which had the chief direction of schools. The\r\nbasis of the functions of the censorship thus constituted was found in\r\nthe three provisions following:\r\n\r\n(1) Watchfulness that in the books and periodicals published, and in\r\nthe pieces represented on the stage “there shall be nothing against\r\nreligion, the government, morality, or the personal honour of any\r\ncitizen.” (2) Care that in the prohibition of the publication or issue\r\nof books and works the committee shall be “guided by a wise indulgence,\r\nsetting aside all biased interpretation of the works or of any part of\r\nthem which might seem to merit prohibition; and wisdom to remember that\r\nwhen such parts seem subject to any doubt or have a double meaning, it\r\nis better to interpret them in the manner most favourable to the author\r\nthan to prosecute him.” (3) “A discreet and wise investigation of truths\r\nconcerning faith, mankind, the position of the citizen, the law, and\r\nall branches of the administration, are to be treated by the censorship\r\nnot only in the most lenient manner, but should enjoy entire liberty of\r\npublication, as contributing to the progress of enlightenment.”\r\n\r\nSuch was the aspect of the censorship and statute which remained\r\nunchanged for more than twenty years, that is during the whole reign\r\nof the emperor Alexander. It was only from the year 1817, from\r\nthe establishment of the ministry of public worship and of public\r\ninstruction, that the censorship acquired a particularly irksome tendency\r\nwhich was in opposition to the liberal spirit of the statute: the most\r\ncomplete intolerance, fanaticism, and captiousness, which had been absent\r\nat the commencement of Alexander’s reign, then made their appearance.\r\n\r\nIn January, 1818 the emperor Alexander came for a short time to St.\r\nPetersburg, and Karamzin took advantage of his stay in order to present\r\nto him the eight volumes of the _History of the Russian Empire_ which he\r\nhad just published. “He received me in his private apartments, and I had\r\nthe happiness of dining with him,” wrote Karamzin to his friend I. I.\r\nDmitriev. “On the 1st of February my _History of the Russian Empire_ was\r\non sale; the edition was of three thousand copies, and in spite of the\r\nhigh price at which the work was sold (55 rubles, paper money, per copy),\r\na month later not a copy was left at the booksellers.”[b]\r\n\r\n\r\nFAILURE OF THE POLISH EXPERIMENT\r\n\r\nThe constitution granted to Poland in 1815, based the government on a\r\ntripartite division of power; the three estates of the realm being the\r\nking, a senate, and a house of representatives--the latter two being\r\ncomprehended under the name of a diet. The executive was vested in the\r\nking, and in functionaries by him appointed. The crown was hereditary;\r\nit was the prerogative of the king to declare war, convoke, prorogue, or\r\ndissolve the diet. He was empowered to appoint a viceroy, who, unless a\r\nmember of the royal family, was to be a Pole. The king or viceroy was\r\nassisted by a council of state and five responsible ministers, their\r\nseveral departments being instruction, justice, interior and police, war,\r\nfinance. These five ministers were subordinate to the president of the\r\ncouncil. Considering the exhaustion, humiliation, and misery to which\r\nPoland had been reduced, such a constitution was apparently a great boon,\r\nfor it guaranteed civil, political, and religious freedom; but by the\r\nvery nature of things it was foredoomed to destruction.\r\n\r\nThe first Polish diet assembled at Warsaw on the 27th of March, 1818.\r\nThe grand duke Constantine, commander-in-chief of the Polish army, was\r\nelected a deputy by the faubourg of Praga, and during the session was\r\nobliged to renounce his privilege as a senator, because, by the terms of\r\nthe constitution, no person could sit in both houses. He was elected by\r\na majority of 103 votes to 6, an evident proof that the new reign had\r\nexcited the liveliest hopes. The emperor arrived at Warsaw on the 13th\r\nof March; he devoted himself laboriously to the examination of state\r\naffairs, and on the 27th he opened the diet in person with a speech in\r\nthe French language. He said, “the organisation which existed in vigorous\r\nmaturity in your country permitted the instant establishment of what I\r\nhave given you, by putting into operation the principles of those liberal\r\ninstitutions which have never ceased to be the object of my solicitude,\r\nand whose salutary influence I hope by the aid of God to disseminate\r\nthrough all the countries which He has confided to my care. Thus you\r\nhave afforded me the means of showing my country what I had long since\r\nprepared for her, and what she shall obtain when the elements of a work\r\nso important shall have attained their necessary development.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HOUSE OF THE ROMANOV CZARS]\r\n\r\nThere is no reason to doubt that Alexander cherished these intentions in\r\nhis own sanguine but impractical way. The enfranchisement of the serfs\r\nof Esthonia, undertaken in 1802 and completed in 1816, and that of the\r\nserfs of Courland in 1817, exhibit the same principles. And when in 1819\r\nthe deputies of the Livonian nobility submitted to the approbation of\r\nthe emperor a plan to pursue the same course with the serfs of their\r\nprovince, the following was his remarkable reply: “I am delighted to see\r\nthat the nobility of Livonia have fulfilled my expectations. You have set\r\nan example that ought to be imitated. You have acted in the spirit of our\r\nage, and have felt that liberal principles alone can form the basis of\r\nthe people’s happiness.”\r\n\r\n“Such,” says Schnitzler, “was constantly, during nearly twenty years,\r\nthe language of Alexander. He deeply mourned the entire absence of all\r\nguarantees for the social well-being of the empire. His regret was\r\nmarked in his reply to Madame de Staël, when she complimented him on the\r\nhappiness of his people, who, without a constitution, were blessed with\r\nsuch a sovereign: ‘I am but a lucky accident.’” After 1815 he was no\r\nlonger even that.\r\n\r\nA year had hardly elapsed from the time when Alexander had addressed\r\nthe words we have quoted to the diet at Warsaw, ere the Poles began\r\nto complain that the constitution was not observed in its essential\r\nprovisions; that their viceroy Zaionczek had but the semblance of\r\nauthority, whilst all the real power was in the hands of the grand\r\nduke Constantine, and of Novosiltzov the Russian commissioner. The\r\nbitterness of their discontent was in proportion with the ardour of their\r\nshort-lived joy. Russian despotism reverted to its essential conditions;\r\nthe liberty of the press was suspended; and in 1819 the national army was\r\ndissolved. On the other hand, the spirit of opposition became so strong\r\nin the diet, that in 1820, a measure relating to criminal procedure,\r\nwhich was pressed forward with all the force of government influence, was\r\nrejected by a majority of 120 to 3. Thenceforth there was nothing but\r\nmutual distrust between Poland and Russia.\r\n\r\n\r\nCONSTITUTIONAL PROJECTS\r\n\r\nThe institutions which Alexander had given to Poland worked no happy\r\nresults, and those which he designed for Russia would have been little\r\nbetter. He failed to accomplish even the good which he might have\r\neffected without organic changes. But he felt himself arrested by\r\ninnumerable difficulties. He often wanted instruments to carry out his\r\nwill, oftener still the firmness to support them against court cabals.\r\nThe immense distances to be traversed, which, according to Custine, the\r\nemperor Nicholas feels to be one of the plagues of his empire, presented\r\nthe same obstacle to Alexander. Again, his desire to exercise European\r\ninfluence distracted his attention from his proper work at home, and the\r\nempire sank back into its old routine. Discouraged at last, and awakening\r\nas he grew older from some of the illusions of his youth, he gave way to\r\nindolence more and more. He saw himself alone, standing opposed to an\r\nimmense festering corruption; in despair he ceased to struggle against\r\nit; and in the latter portion of his reign he grievously neglected the\r\ncare of his government.\r\n\r\nThe helm thus deserted by the pilot passed into the hands of General\r\nAraktcheiev, a shrewd, active man, devoted to business, perhaps also\r\nwell-intentioned, but a Russian of the old school, without the necessary\r\nenlightenment, without political probity--arbitrary, imperious, and\r\nenthralled by qualities and notions inimical to progress; governed,\r\nmoreover, by unworthy connections of a particular kind. Under the rule\r\nof Araktcheiev the censorship became more severe than ever. Foreign\r\nbooks were admitted with difficulty, and were subject to tyrannical\r\nrestrictions; many professors of the new university of St. Petersburg\r\nwere subjected to a despotic and galling inquisition; others were\r\nrequired most rigidly to base their course of instructions upon a\r\nprogramme printed and issued by the supreme authority. Freemasonry\r\nwas suppressed. Foreign travellers were surrounded with troublesome\r\nand vexatious formalities. Many rigorous regulations, which had been\r\nlong disused and almost forgotten, were revived. In short, Araktcheiev\r\nexercised with intolerable severity a power which he derived from a\r\nmaster who carried gentleness to an extreme of weakness--who loved to\r\ndiscuss the rights of humanity, and whose heart bled for its sufferings.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE MILITARY COLONIES (1819 A.D.)\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [1819 A.D.]]\r\n\r\nIt was by the advice of Araktcheiev that military colonies were\r\nestablished in Russia in 1819. The system was not new, for Austria had\r\nalready adopted it on some of her frontiers; but its introduction into\r\nRussia was a novelty from which great results were expected, and which\r\nneighbouring states regarded with much uneasiness. The plan was to\r\nquarter the soldiers upon the crown-peasants, build military villages\r\naccording to a fixed plan, apportion a certain quantity of field to every\r\nhouse, and form a statute-book, according to which these new colonies\r\nshould be governed. The plan at once received the approbation of the\r\nczar. It was the intention of Araktcheiev, by means of these colonies,\r\nto reduce the expense entailed by the subsistence of the army, and to\r\ncompel the soldier to contribute to his own maintenance by cultivating\r\nthe soil; to strengthen the ranks by a reserve picked from among the\r\ncrown-peasants, equal in number to the colony of soldiers; to furnish\r\nthe soldier with a home, in which his wife and children might continue\r\nto dwell when the exigencies of war called him away; and to increase the\r\npopulation, and with it the cultivation of the soil, in a land where\r\nhands only are wanting to change many a steppe into a garden, many a\r\nscattered village into a thriving town.\r\n\r\nRussian colonies were thus established in the governments of Novgorod,\r\nMohilev, Kharkov, Kiev, Podolia, and Kherson; that is to say, in the\r\nneighbourhood of Poland, Austria, and Turkey. Political and military\r\nconsiderations had combined to fix the choice of localities for these\r\ncolonies. In consequence of the vast dimensions of the Russian Empire,\r\ntroops raised in the north and west can only reach the southern provinces\r\nafter long intervals; and if, on any emergency, Russia should wish to\r\nconcentrate a large part of her forces in the neighbourhood of the\r\nsouthern and western frontiers, such a concentration, it was thought,\r\nwould be greatly facilitated by the fact of military colonies, with\r\na large population, being already on the spot. The villages destined\r\nfor the reception of military colonies were all to be inhabited by\r\ncrown-peasants; these people were now relieved from the duties they had\r\nbeen accustomed to pay to the government, in consideration of their\r\nquartering men in their houses. All peasants more than fifty years of\r\nage were selected to be so-called head colonists, or master-colonists.\r\nEvery master-colonist received forty acres of land, for which he had to\r\nmaintain a soldier and his family, and to find fodder for a horse, if a\r\ncorps of cavalry happened to be quartered in the village. The soldier,\r\non his part, was bound to assist the colonist in the cultivation of\r\nhis field and the farm labours generally, whenever his military duties\r\ndid not occupy the whole day. The soldier, who in this way became\r\ndomiciliated in the family, received the name “military peasant.” The\r\nofficers had the power of choosing the soldiers who were to be quartered\r\nupon the master-colonists. If the colonist had several sons, the oldest\r\nbecame his adjunct; the second was enrolled among the reserve; the third\r\nmight become a military peasant; the others were enrolled as colonists\r\nor pupils. Thus, in the new arrangements, two entirely different elements\r\nwere fused together, and one population was, so to speak, engrafted upon\r\nanother.\r\n\r\nThe labour of these agricultural soldiers is of course dependent upon\r\nthe will of the officers, for they can only attend to agricultural work\r\nwhen freed from military duty. The man himself continues half peasant,\r\nhalf soldier, until he has served for five-and-twenty years, if he be\r\na Russian, or twenty years if he be a Pole. At the expiration of this\r\ntime he is at liberty to quit the service, and his place is filled\r\nup from the reserve. Beside the house of each master-colonist stands\r\nanother dwelling constructed in exactly the same manner, and occupied by\r\nthe reserve-man, who may be regarded as a double of the soldier. He is\r\nselected by the colonel of the regiment from among the peasants, and is\r\ngenerally a son or relation of the master-colonist. The reserve-man is\r\ninstructed in all the duties appertaining to the soldier’s profession,\r\nand is educated in every particular, so that he may be an efficient\r\nsubstitute. If the agricultural soldier dies, or falls in battle, his\r\nreserve-man immediately takes his place. The colonist now takes the\r\nplace of the reserve-man, who in his turn is succeeded by the pupil.\r\nThe master-colonist, peasant-soldier, and reserve-man, may all choose\r\ntheir wives at pleasure, and they are encouraged to marry. The women,\r\non the other hand, are allowed to marry within the limits of their\r\ncolony, but not beyond it. The sons of the master-colonists, soldiers,\r\nor reserve-men, between the ages of thirteen and seventeen, are called\r\n“cantonists.” They are drilled like soldiers, and occasionally attend\r\nschools. The children between the ages of eight and thirteen visit the\r\nschool of the village in which their parents dwell, and are exercised\r\nin the use of arms on alternate days. Like the cantonists, they wear\r\nuniforms, and are looked upon as future soldiers. All male children\r\nare sent to school, where, by the method of reciprocal education, they\r\nare taught to read, write, and cipher, alternately with their military\r\nstudies. They are taught to recite a kind of catechism, setting forth the\r\nduties of the soldier; they learn the use of the sabre; are practised\r\nin riding, and, when they have attained the age of seventeen years, are\r\nmustered in the headquarters of the regiment, and divided into corps,\r\nthose who distinguish themselves by attention and diligence being\r\nappointed officers. The several component parts of a colony are as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n1. The head colonist--the master of the house and possessor of the\r\nestate. 2. His assistant, who joins him in the cultivation of his farm.\r\n3. The military peasant, who likewise takes part in agricultural labour.\r\n4. The reserve-man, who supplies the place of the soldier in case of\r\nneed. 5. The cantonist, between the ages of thirteen and seventeen. 6.\r\nThe boys, from eight to thirteen years old. 7. Male children under the\r\nage of eight years. 8. The female population. 9. The invalids.\r\n\r\nThe colonies in the south of Russia comprise 380 villages in the\r\nprovinces of Kherson, Kharkov, and Iekaterainoslav. The crown has here\r\n30,000 peasants. Every village contains two or three squadrons, according\r\nto its size; thus they contain altogether 80,000 men. These military\r\ndistricts, as the regions are called in which the colonies occur, are so\r\nstrictly divided from the remaining portions of the provinces, that no\r\nman can enter them without a special passport, granted by the military\r\nauthorities. Their constitution is entirely military, even the postal\r\nservice being executed by soldiers. At every station a subaltern receives\r\nthe order for post-horses and inspects it; another soldier harnesses\r\nthe horses; a third greases the wheels; and a fourth mounts the box as\r\ncoachman. As soon as the military coat appears in sight, every peasant\r\non the high-road stops, plants his hands stiffly against his sides, and\r\nstands in a military attitude of “attention.”\r\n\r\nThe laws are administered in the first instance by a detachment from\r\nevery squadron, one of the officers acting as president. From the\r\ndecision of this tribunal an appeal can be made to the regimental\r\ncouncil, which is composed of the colonel, two captains, and six deputies\r\nfrom among the colonists. The judgments of this court are laid before\r\nthe commandant-in-chief of the colonies, against whose decision neither\r\nsoldiers nor colonists may protest, officers alone having the privilege\r\nof appealing to the emperor. In the headquarters of every regiment a\r\ncopy of the code of laws is kept, and in most military villages churches\r\nare to be found, where a priest, who belonged to the church before the\r\nvillage was transformed into a military colony, performs the service.\r\n\r\nThe success of the military colonies in Russia fell far short of the\r\nexpectations of their founders. To the unfortunate crown serfs they\r\nbrought an intolerable aggravation of their wretchedness, by making them\r\nfeel their slavery even in their homes and their domestic affections. The\r\nconsequence was seen in the madness of their revenge on several occasions\r\nwhen they broke out into rebellion, as for instance at Novgorod, in 1832.\r\n“Nothing,” says Dr. Lee, “could be sold without the knowledge of the\r\nofficers in these military colonies. It is said that when a hen lays an\r\negg, it is necessary to make an entry of the fact in a register kept for\r\nthis and other equally important purposes. I was told that when a priest\r\nwas speaking to some of these peasants about the punishments of hell,\r\nthey answered they dreaded them not, because a worse hell than that in\r\nwhich they were doomed to pass their whole lives here, could not possibly\r\nexist.\r\n\r\n“The military colonies,” Lee continues, “please one at first sight from\r\nthe order and cleanliness everywhere prevailing in them; but their\r\npopulation is said to be wretched in the highest degree. When the emperor\r\nAlexander was here, some years ago, he went round visiting every house;\r\nand on every table he found a dinner prepared, one of the principal\r\narticles of which consisted of a young pig roasted. The prince Volkhonski\r\nsuspected there was some trick, and cut off the tail of the pig and put\r\nin his pocket. On entering the next house the pig was presented, but\r\nwithout the tail, upon which Prince Volkhonski said to the emperor, ‘I\r\nthink this is an old friend.’ The emperor demanded his meaning, when\r\nhe took out the tail from his pocket and applied it to the part from\r\nwhich it had been removed. The emperor did not relish the jest, and\r\nit was supposed this piece of pleasantry led to his disgrace. A more\r\neffectual, though bold and dangerous method of exposing to the emperor\r\nthe deceptions carried on throughout the military colonies under Count\r\nAraktcheiev could not have been adopted than that which Prince Volkhonski\r\nhad recourse to on this occasion. From that time Count Araktcheiev became\r\nhis bitter enemy.”\r\n\r\n\r\nALEXANDER AND THE GREEK UPRISING\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [1822 A.D.]]\r\n\r\nWe have now touched upon all that is worthy of note in Alexander’s home\r\npolicy during the last ten years of his reign. That portion of his life\r\nwas spent in perpetual motion and perpetual agitation to little or\r\nno good purpose, whilst his proper functions were delegated to Count\r\nAraktcheiev, whose name was a word of terror to everyone in Russia.\r\nAbsorbed by affairs foreign to the interests of his empire, Alexander\r\nwas consistent or persevering in nothing but his efforts to enforce the\r\ndark, stagnant policy of Austria, which had become that of the Holy\r\nAlliance. He was present at the congresses of Aix-la-Chapelle, Troppau,\r\nLaibach, and Verona, and zealously participated in all the repressive\r\nmeasures concerted there. He was the soul of the deliberations held at\r\nthe latter place in 1822, and whilst he refused aid to the Greeks in\r\ntheir rebellion against their “legitimate sovereign,” the sultan, he was\r\nall but inclined to use constraint to his ally, France, to compel her, in\r\nspite of the opposition of England, to take upon herself the execution\r\nof the violent measures resolved on in behalf of the execrable Ferdinand\r\nof Spain. A speech made at this congress to Châteaubriand, the French\r\nplenipotentiary, has been praised by some of the emperor’s biographers\r\nfor its “noble sentiments.” To us it seems well worthy of record for its\r\nunconscious sophistry and signal display of self-delusion.\r\n\r\n“I am very happy,” said the emperor to Châteaubriand, “that you came to\r\nVerona, because you may now bear witness to the truth. Would you have\r\nbelieved, as our enemies are so fond of asserting, that the alliance is\r\nonly a word intended to cover ambition? That might have received a colour\r\nof truth under the old order of things, but now all private interests\r\ndisappear when the civilisation of the world is imperilled. Henceforward\r\nthere can be no English, French, Russian, Prussian, or Austrian policy;\r\nthere can only be a general policy, involving the salvation of all,\r\nadmitted in common by kings and peoples. It is for me, the first of\r\nall, to declare my appreciation of the principles on which I founded\r\nthe Holy Alliance. An opportunity presents itself; it is the Greek\r\ninsurrection. Certainly no event appeared more adapted to my personal\r\ninterests, to those of my subjects, and to the feelings and prejudices of\r\nthe Russians, than a religious war against Turkey; but in the troubles\r\nof the Peloponnesus I saw revolutionary symptoms, and from that moment\r\nI held aloof. What has not been done to dissolve the alliance? Attempts\r\nhave been made by turns to excite my cupidity, or to wound my self-love;\r\nI have been openly outraged; the world understood me very badly if it\r\nsupposes that my principles could be shaken by vanities, or could give\r\nway before resentment. No, no; I will never separate myself from the\r\nmonarchs with whom I am united. It should be permitted to kings to form\r\npublic alliances, to protect themselves against secret associations.\r\nWhat temptations can be offered to me? What need have I to extend my\r\nempire? Providence has not placed under my command eight hundred thousand\r\nsoldiers to satisfy my ambition, and to conserve those principles of\r\norder on which society must repose.”\r\n\r\nThis was not the language of “noble sentiment,” but of an intellect\r\nnarrowed by sinister influences, perverted to the views of a most sordid\r\npolicy, and flattering itself on its own debasement with the maudlin cant\r\nof philanthropy.\r\n\r\nWe may well conceive that it was not without inward pain and\r\nself-reproach that the benevolent Alexander stifled in his heart the\r\nvoice that rose in favour of the Greeks, and resisted the wishes of his\r\npeople, who were animated by a lively sympathy for their co-religionists.\r\nThat sympathy was manifested as strongly as it could be under this\r\ndespotic government, where every outward demonstration is interdicted,\r\nunless when specially commanded or permitted by authority. They could not\r\nsee without surprise the head of the so-styled orthodox church enduring\r\nthe outrages of the infidels, and looking on unmoved whilst one of her\r\nchief pastors was hung at the porch of his church, and multitudes of\r\nher children were massacred. These Greeks had of late been regarded\r\nas under the protection of Russia; she was their old ally--nay, more,\r\ntheir accomplice, who had more than once instigated them to break their\r\nchains. The supineness of the emperor under such circumstances mortified\r\nthe nobility, shocked the clergy, and was a subject of sincere affliction\r\nto the people, for whom, in their debased condition, religious sentiments\r\nheld the place of political emotions.\r\n\r\nHigh and low obeyed, however; murmurs were suppressed; but the Russians\r\nfailed not to attribute to the wrath of God the misfortunes which befel\r\nAlexander, amongst which was the malady with which he was afflicted in\r\n1824. It began with erysipelas in the leg, which soon spread upwards,\r\nand was accompanied with fever and delirium. For a time his life was in\r\ndanger, and the people, who sincerely loved him, believed that they saw\r\nin this a punishment from on high because he had abandoned an orthodox\r\nnation.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE GREAT INUNDATION OF 1824\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [1824 A.D.]]\r\n\r\nAnother misfortune was a frightful calamity which befel St. Petersburg\r\nin 1824. The mouth of the Neva, opening westward into the gulf of\r\nFinland, is exposed to the violent storms that often accompany the\r\nautumnal equinox. They suddenly drive the waters of the gulf into the\r\nbed of the river, which then casts forth its accumulated floods upon\r\nthe low quarters on both its banks. It may be conceived how terrible is\r\nthe destruction which the unchained waters make in a city built upon a\r\ndrained marsh, on the eve of a northern winter of seven months’ duration.\r\nThere were terrific inundations in 1728, 1729, 1735, 1740, 1742, and in\r\n1777, a few days before the birth of Alexander; but the worst of all was\r\nthat which occurred on the 19th of November, 1824, a year before his\r\ndeath. A storm blowing from the west and southwest with extreme violence,\r\nforced back the waters of the Neva, and drove those of the gulf into\r\nit.[e]\r\n\r\nAt eight o’clock in the morning the waters began to rise rapidly and had\r\nsoon submerged all the lower parts of the town. On the Nevski Prospect\r\nthe water had reached the Troitski Perenlok, and by twelve three parts\r\nof the town were submerged, owing to a southwesterly wind which rose\r\nto a violent tempest. At a quarter to three the waters began suddenly\r\nto subside. The emperor was profoundly moved by the awful calamity\r\nwhich took place before his eyes, and in the gloomy frame of mind that\r\nhad possession of him he regarded it as a punishment for his sins. As\r\nsoon as the water had so far subsided as to make it possible to drive\r\nthrough the streets he set off for the Galernaia (in the lower part of\r\nthe town). There a terrible picture of destruction was unfolded before\r\nhim. Visibly affected he stopped and got out of the carriage; he stood\r\nfor a few moments without speaking, the tears flowing down his cheeks:\r\nthe people, sobbing and weeping, surrounded him: “God is punishing us\r\nfor our sins,” said someone in the crowd. “No, for mine,” answered the\r\nemperor sorrowfully, and he himself began to give orders about arranging\r\ntemporary refuge and affording assistance to the sufferers. On the\r\nnext day, the 8th (20th) of November, Count Araktcheiev, Alexander’s\r\nfavourite, wrote the following letter to the emperor:\r\n\r\n“I could not sleep all night, knowing what your state of mind must be,\r\nfor I am convinced how much your majesty must be now suffering from the\r\ncalamity of yesterday. But God certainly sometimes sends such misfortunes\r\nin order that His chosen ones may show in an unusual degree their\r\ncompassionate care for the unfortunate. Your majesty will of course do so\r\nin the present case. For this money is necessary and money without delay,\r\nin order to give assistance, not to the well-to-do but to the poorest.\r\nYour subjects must help you, and therefore I venture to submit my idea to\r\nyou.\r\n\r\n“The wise dispositions that you made, _batushka_,[65] with regard to my\r\ninsignificant labours have constituted a tolerably considerable capital.\r\nIn my position I have not required to use any of this capital even as\r\ntable money, and now I ask as a reward that a million may be separated\r\nfrom the capital and employed in assisting the poor people. God will\r\ncertainly give his help in this matter to the benefit of the country\r\nand the glory of your majesty, and bring about a still better means\r\nfor its accomplishment. Batushka, order that a committee may be formed\r\nof compassionate people, in order that they may without delay occupy\r\nthemselves with the relief of the poorest. They will glorify your name,\r\nand I, hearing it, shall thus enjoy the greatest pleasure on earth.”\r\n\r\nThe emperor answered Count Araktcheiev the same day in a few gracious\r\nlines, full of heartfelt gratitude: “We are in complete agreement\r\nin our ideas, dear Alexis Andreivitch. Your letter has comforted me\r\ninexpressibly, for it is impossible that I should not be deeply grieved\r\nat the calamity of yesterday, and especially at the thought of those who\r\nhave perished or who mourn for relatives. Come to me to-morrow so that we\r\nmay arrange everything. Ever your sincerely affectionate Alexander.”\r\n\r\nThe emperor sent a note of the following content to Adjutant-General\r\nDiebitsch: “In order to afford effectual relief to the sufferers from\r\nthe inundation of the 7th of November, and on account of the destruction\r\nof the bridges and the difficulties of communication between the various\r\nparts of the town, the following military governors are temporarily\r\nappointed under the direction of the military governor-general, Count\r\nMiloradovitch: for Vasili Oetroo, Adjutant-General Benkendorv; for the\r\nSt. Petersburg side, Adjutant-General Komarovski; and for the Viboz side,\r\nAdjutant-General Depreradovitch.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: TVERSKI GATE, MOSCOW]\r\n\r\nOn the 8th of November the emperor sent for the newly appointed military\r\ngovernors and declared his will to them--that the most speedy and\r\neffectual assistance should be given to the unfortunate sufferers from\r\nthe awful catastrophe. Count Komarovski, in describing the reception\r\ngiven to him and the other military governors, says that tears were\r\nobserved in the emperor’s eyes. “I am sure that you share my feelings\r\nof compassion,” continued Alexander; “here are your instructions, which\r\nhave been hastily drawn up--your hearts will complete them. Go from here\r\nstraight to the minister of finance who has orders to give each of you\r\n100,000 rubles to begin with.” According to Komarovski the emperor spoke\r\nwith such feeling and eloquence that all the assembled governors were\r\ndeeply touched.\r\n\r\nAt the time of the inundation in a space of five hours about 5,000\r\npersons perished and 3,609 domestic animals; 324 houses were destroyed\r\nor carried away, and 3,581 damaged; besides this pavements, foot ways,\r\nquays, bridges, etc., were either destroyed or damaged. Considerable\r\ndestruction and damage was also occasioned in the environs of the\r\ncapital, on the Petershov road, in old Petershov, Oranienbaum, and\r\nKronstadt, along the northern shore. More than 100 persons perished in\r\nthese places, while 114 buildings were destroyed and 187 damaged.\r\n\r\nOn the 22nd of November the emperor assisted at a requiem service in the\r\nKazan cathedral for those who had perished during the inundation. The\r\nhistorian Karamzin writes that the people as they listened to the requiem\r\nwept and gazed at the czar.[b]\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CLOSE OF ALEXANDER’S REIGN\r\n\r\nThe czar, deeply affected by the sad spectacles he had witnessed, never\r\nrecovered from the shock. This increased his disgust of life and the\r\nheavy melancholy that had of late being growing upon him. The whole\r\naspect of Europe gave fearful tokens that the policy of the Holy Alliance\r\nwas false and untenable; it was everywhere the subject of execration, and\r\nits destruction was the aim of an almost universal conspiracy, extending\r\neven into Alexander’s own dominions. Poland inspired him with deep alarm,\r\nand his native country, notwithstanding her habits of immobility, seemed\r\nripe for convulsions. Thus his public life was filled with disappointment\r\nand care, and his private life was deeply clouded with horrors.\r\n\r\nThe diet of Warsaw had become so refractory, that in 1820 Alexander had\r\nfound it necessary to suspend it, in violation of the constitution given\r\nby himself; and though he opened a new diet in 1824, he did so under such\r\nrestrictions, that the Poles rightly considered it a mere mockery of\r\nrepresentative forms.\r\n\r\nRussia herself was by no means tranquil. In the year 1824 insurrections\r\nof the peasants occurred in several governments, and especially in that\r\nof Novgorod, in dangerous vicinity to the first-founded of the military\r\ncolonies. The latter themselves shared the general discontent, and\r\nthreatened to become a fearful focus of rebellion, as was actually the\r\ncase in 1832. There existed also in Russia other centres of disaffection,\r\nthe existence of which might have been long before known to Alexander,\r\nbut for his culpable habit of allowing petitions to collect in heaps in\r\nhis cabinet without even breaking their seals. He, however, learned the\r\nfact on his last journey into Poland in June, 1825, or immediately after\r\nhis return.[66] He then received the first intimation of the conspiracy\r\nwhich had for many years been plotting against himself and against\r\nthe existing order of things in Russia--a conspiracy which, as many\r\nbelieve, involved the perpetration of regicide. It is a curious fact,\r\nbut one by no means unparalleled, that in a country where the police is\r\nso active, such a plot should have remained for years undetected. In\r\n1816, several young Russians who had served in the European campaigns of\r\nthe three preceding years, and who had directed their attention to the\r\nsecret associations which had so greatly contributed to the liberation\r\nof Germany, conceived the idea of establishing similar associations in\r\nRussia; and this was the origin of that abortive insurrection which broke\r\nout in St. Petersburg on the day when the troops were required to take\r\nthe oath of allegiance to Alexander’s successor.\r\n\r\nThese details would be sufficient of themselves to account for the\r\nmelancholy that haunted Alexander in the later years of his reign, and\r\nwhich was painfully manifest in his countenance. But he had to undergo\r\nother sufferings.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [1825 A.D.]]\r\n\r\nHe was not more than sixteen years of age when his grandmother, Catherine\r\nII, had married him to the amiable and beautiful princess Maria of Baden,\r\nthen scarcely fifteen.[67] The match was better assorted than is usually\r\nthe case in the highest conditions of life, but it was not a happy one.\r\nIt might have been so if it had been delayed until the young couple\r\nwere of more mature years, and had not the empress unwisely restricted\r\ntheir freedom after marriage, and spoiled her grandson as a husband by\r\nattempting to make him a good one in obedience to her orders. Moreover,\r\nthe tie of offspring was wanting which might have drawn the parents’\r\nhearts together, for two daughters, born in the first two years of their\r\nunion, died early. Alexander formed other attachments, one of which with\r\nthe countess Narishkin, lasted eleven years, until it was dissolved by\r\nher inconstancy. She had borne him three children; only one was left,\r\na girl as beautiful as her mother, who was now the sole joy of her\r\nfather’s sad heart. But the health of Sophia Narishkin was delicate, and\r\nhe was compelled to part with her, that she might be removed to a milder\r\nclimate. She returned too soon, and died on the eve of her marriage, in\r\nher eighteenth year. The news was communicated to Alexander one morning\r\nwhen he was reviewing his guard. “I receive the reward of my deeds,” were\r\nthe first words that escaped from his agonised heart.\r\n\r\nElizabeth, whose love had survived long years of neglect, had tears to\r\nshed for the daughter of her rival, and none sympathised more deeply than\r\nshe with the suffering father. He began to see in her what his people\r\nhad long seen, an angel of goodness and resignation; his affection for\r\nher revived, and he strove to wean her from the bitter recollections\r\nof the past by his constant and devoted attention. But long-continued\r\nsorrows had undermined Elizabeth’s health, and her physicians ordered\r\nthat she should be removed to her native air. She refused, however, to\r\ncomply with this advice, declaring that the wife of the emperor of Russia\r\nshould die nowhere else than in his dominions. It was then proposed to\r\ntry the southern provinces of the empire, and Alexander selected for her\r\nresidence the little town of Taganrog, on the sea of Azov, resolving\r\nhimself to make all the arrangements for her reception in that remote\r\nand little frequented spot. A journey of 1800 versts, after the many\r\nother journeys he had already made since the opening of the year, was\r\na fatigue too great for him to sustain without injury, suffering as he\r\nstill was from erysipelas; but he was accustomed to listen to no advice\r\non the subject of his movements, and two or three thousand versts were\r\nnothing in his estimation; besides, on this occasion, in the very fatigue\r\nof travelling he sought his repose: he would fulfil a duty which was to\r\nappease his conscience. He quitted St. Petersburg in the beginning of\r\nSeptember, 1825, preceding the empress by several days. His principal\r\ntravelling companions were Prince Volkhonski, one of the friends of his\r\nyouth of whom we have already heard; his aide-de-camp general, Baron\r\nDiebitsch, a distinguished military man who had been made over to him\r\nby the king of Prussia; and his physician, Sir James Wylie, who had\r\nbeen about his person for thirty years, and was at the head of the army\r\nmedical department.\r\n\r\nThe journey was prosperous, and was accomplished with Alexander’s\r\nusual rapidity in twelve days, the travellers passing over 150 versts\r\na day; but his mind was oppressed with gloomy forebodings, and these\r\nwere strengthened by the sight of a comet; for though brought up by a\r\nphilosophic grandmother, and by a free-thinking tutor, he was by no\r\nmeans exempt from superstition. “Ilia,” he called out to his old and\r\nfaithful coachman, “have you seen the new star? Do you know that a comet\r\nalways presages misfortune? But God’s will be done!” A very favourable\r\nchange having taken place in the empress’s health in Taganrog, Alexander\r\nventured to leave her early in October, for a short excursion through\r\nthe Crimea. On the 26th of that month Dr. Robert Lee, family physician\r\nto Count Vorontzov was one of the emperor’s guests at Alupka. He relates\r\nthat at dinner Alexander repeatedly expressed how much he was pleased\r\nwith Orianda, where he had been that day, and stated that it was his\r\ndetermination to have a palace built there as expeditiously as possible.\r\n“To my amazement,” says Dr. Lee, “he said after a pause, ‘When I give\r\nin my demission, I shall return and fix myself at Orianda, and wear the\r\ncostume of the Taurida.’ Not a word was uttered when this extraordinary\r\nresolution was announced, and I thought that I must have misunderstood\r\nthe emperor; but this could not have been, for in a short time, when\r\nCount Vorontzov proposed that the large open flat space of ground to\r\nthe westward of Orianda should be converted into pleasure-grounds for\r\nhis majesty, he replied: ‘I wish this to be purchased for General\r\nDiebitsch, as it is right that the chief of my état-major and I should be\r\nneighbours.’”\r\n\r\nDuring the latter part of his tour in the Crimea, Alexander had some\r\nthreatenings of illness, but peremptorily refused all medical treatment.\r\nHe returned to Taganrog on the 17th of November, with evident symptoms\r\nof a severe attack of the bilious remittent fever of the Crimea. He\r\npersisted in rejecting medical aid until it was too late, and died on the\r\n1st of December. For a long time the belief prevailed throughout Europe\r\nthat he had been assassinated; but it is now established beyond question\r\nthat his death was a natural one. The empress survived him but five\r\nmonths.\r\n\r\nAlexander’s last days were embittered by fresh disclosures brought to\r\nhim by General Count de Witt, respecting the conspiracy by which, if\r\nthe official report is to be believed, he was doomed to assassination.\r\nFrom that time he declared himself disgusted with life. Once when Sir\r\nJames Wylie was pressing him to take some medicine, “My friend,” said\r\nAlexander, “it is the state of my nerves to which you must attend; they\r\nare in frightful disorder.”--“Alas!” rejoined the physician, “that\r\nhappens more frequently to kings than to ordinary men.”--“Yes,” said\r\nthe emperor, with animation, “but with me in particular there are many\r\nspecial reasons, and at the present hour more so than ever.” Some days\r\nafterwards, when his brain was almost delirious, the czar gazed intently\r\non the doctor, his whole countenance manifesting intense fear. “Oh, my\r\nfriend,” he exclaimed, “what an act, what a horrible act! The monsters!\r\nthe ungrateful monsters! I designed nothing but their happiness.”[e]\r\n\r\n“It is difficult to represent the condition of St. Petersburg during the\r\nlast years of the reign of the emperor Alexander,” writes a contemporary.\r\n“It was as though enveloped in a moral fog; Alexander’s gloomy views,\r\nmore sad than stern, were reflected in its inhabitants. Many people\r\nsaid: What does he want more? He stands at the zenith of power. Each one\r\nexplained after his own fashion the inconsolable grief of the emperor.\r\nFor a man who must live to all eternity, who was famed as the friend\r\nof liberty, and who had out of necessity become her oppressor, it was\r\ngrievous to think that he must renounce the love of his contemporaries\r\nand the praise of posterity. Many other circumstances and some family\r\nones also weighed on his soul. The last years of Alexander’s life,”\r\nwrites in conclusion the eye-witness of these sorrowful days, “may be\r\ntermed a prolonged eclipse.”\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Death of Alexander I_\r\n\r\nOn the 1st of December, 1825, a truly great misfortune fell upon Russia:\r\nthe best of European sovereigns had ceased to exist. When he vanished\r\nfrom the political arena, only the finer side of his life came into view;\r\nthe remainder was given over to oblivion. A contemporary who was at the\r\nsame time a poet writes: “You see arising before you that beautiful\r\nspirit that was welcomed with such joy in 1801; you see that glorious\r\nczar to whom Russia owes the years 1813 and 1814; you see the comforter\r\nof the people after last year’s inundation; you see that gracious,\r\nbenevolent man who was so amiable in personal intercourse,” and who, in\r\nthe words of Speranski, will ever remain a true charmer. There was much\r\nthat was ideally beautiful in his soul, he sincerely loved and desired\r\ngood, and attained to it. There was indeed cause for grief, particularly\r\nin view of the uncertainty of the future that awaited Russia, which,\r\naccording to the picturesque expression of a Russian writer after the\r\ndeath of Alexander, had, as it were, to enter a cold, uninviting passage\r\nto a long dark tunnel. This was a feeling that was shared by many\r\ncontemporaries.\r\n\r\nIndependently of the grief which fell upon all Russia, for the persons\r\nwho had surrounded the deceased monarch at his death a truly tragic\r\nmoment had approached. Far from the capital and from all the members\r\nof the imperial family, in an isolated town (Taganrog) of the Russian\r\nempire, at two thousand versts from the centre of government the\r\nterrible question arose: Who would now be emperor, to whom was the oath\r\nof allegiance to be taken, and by whom in future would orders issue?\r\nMoreover, it was amidst the ramifications of a vast conspiracy and a\r\nuniversal fermentation that these questions presented themselves.\r\n\r\n“The sphinx, undivined even to the grave,” as the poet justly called\r\nAlexander, had not revealed his royal will, and even in view of the\r\ninevitable end he had not considered it necessary to refer by a single\r\nword or hint to the question that was of such crucial interest to the\r\nwelfare of Russia. On the contrary, during the last days of his life\r\nAlexander had as though consciously set aside all earthly matters and\r\ndied like a private individual who has closed his accounts with the\r\nworld. Therefore it is not surprising that he failed to indicate the\r\nsuccessor he had chosen; being satisfied with the dispositions he had\r\npreviously made in secret, he seemed to think: “After my death they will\r\nopen my will and testament and will learn to whom Russia belongs.”\r\n\r\nDuring the life of Alexander no one knew of the existence of the act\r\nnaming the grand duke Nicholas Pavlovitch heir to the throne except three\r\nstate dignitaries: Count Araktcheiev, Prince A. N. Galitzin, and the\r\narchbishop of Moscow, Philaret. By a fatal concurrence of circumstances,\r\nnot one of them was present at the decease of the emperor at Taganrog. Of\r\nthe three persons of confidence who were with Alexander, Adjutant-general\r\nPrince Volkonski, Baron Diebitsch, and Tchernichev, not one was aware\r\nthat the elder brother’s right to the succession of the throne had been\r\ntransferred to the second. Adjutant-general Diebitsch afterwards said to\r\nDanilevski: “The emperor, who had confided many secrets to me, never,\r\nhowever, told me a word of this. Once we were together at the settlement,\r\nand he, directing the conversation to the grand duke Nicholas Pavlovitch,\r\nsaid, “You must support him.” I concluded from these words only that,\r\njudging from the age of the grand duke, he might be expected to outlive\r\nthe emperor and the czarevitch, in which case he would naturally be their\r\nsuccessor.”\r\n\r\nSuch were the limits of the knowledge that Diebitsch had at his disposal\r\nin Taganrog as the question of the succession. Nor did Prince Volkonski\r\nknow anything about the matter. Even the empress Elizabeth Alexievna\r\nwas in the same ignorance regarding the rejection of the grand duke\r\nConstantine Pavlovitch.\r\n\r\n“When the illness of Alexander at Taganrog no longer gave any hopes\r\nof recovery,” relates Diebitsch, “Prince Volkonski advised me to ask\r\nthe empress to whom, in case of the emperor’s death, I as chief of his\r\nmajesty’s general staff must address myself, for my position was one\r\nof very great difficulty; I was left chief of the army at a time when\r\ninstances of a conspiracy were being disclosed. I could not decide upon\r\npersonally proposing such a question to the empress, fearing to distress\r\nher, besides which, although I enjoyed her favour, yet it was not to such\r\na degree as Prince Volkonski, who was the friend of the imperial family;\r\ntherefore I urgently requested him to take upon himself this explanation\r\nwith the empress. He only consented under the condition that I should\r\nbe present. We went together into the room where the emperor was lying\r\nunconscious, and Prince Volkonski, going up to Elizabeth Alexievna said\r\nto her that I, as chief of the staff, requested her to say to whom, in\r\ncase of misfortune, I was to address myself? ‘Is the emperor then so ill\r\nthat there is no hope?’ asked the empress. ‘God alone can help and save\r\nthe emperor: only the tranquillity and security of Russia demand that the\r\ntraditional forms should be observed,’ answered the prince Volkonski.\r\n\r\n“‘Of course in case of an unhappy event the grand duke Constantine\r\nPavlovitch must be referred to,’ said the empress. The words plainly\r\nproved the empress’ ignorance as to who was named heir to the throne.\r\nPrince Volkonski and I supposed that the late emperor Alexander had\r\nmade a will, for he had an envelope with a paper in it always with him,\r\nwhich never left him. When we opened it after his death we found that it\r\ncontained some written-out prayers.”\r\n\r\nSuch being the position of affairs it only remained for Adjutant-general\r\nDiebitsch to inform the czarevitch Constantine Pavlovitch in Warsaw\r\nof the melancholy event, as the person who, according to the law of\r\nsuccession, had become emperor of all the Russias. It was then that\r\nDiebitsch wrote a letter to the empress Marie Feodorovna in which he\r\nsaid in conclusion: “I humbly await the commands of our new lawful\r\nsovereign, the emperor Constantine Pavlovitch.” The act of the decease\r\nof the emperor Alexander was drawn up in Taganrog, annexed to the report\r\nof Baron Diebitsch, dated December 1st, 1825, and sent to the emperor\r\nConstantine.[b]\r\n\r\n\r\nALISON’S ESTIMATE OF ALEXANDER I\r\n\r\nMajestic in figure, a benevolent expression of countenance, gave\r\nAlexander I that sway over the multitude which ever belongs to physical\r\nadvantages in youthful princes; while the qualities of his understanding\r\nand the feelings of his heart secured the admiration of all whose talents\r\nfitted them to judge of the affairs of nations. Misunderstood by those\r\nwho formed their opinion only from the ease and occasional levity of his\r\nmanner, he was early formed to great determinations, and evinced in the\r\nmost trying circumstances, during the French invasion and the congress\r\nof Vienna, a solidity of judgment equalled only by the strength of his\r\nresolution. He had formed, early in life, an intimacy with the Polish\r\nprince, Czartorinski, and another attachment, of a more tender nature,\r\nto a lady of the same nation; and in consequence he considered the\r\nPoles so dear to him, that many of the best informed patriots in that\r\ncountry hailed his accession to the throne as the first step towards\r\nthe restoration of its nationality. A disposition naturally generous\r\nand philanthropic, moulded by precepts of Laharpe, had strongly imbued\r\nhis mind with liberal principles, which shone forth in full and perhaps\r\ndangerous lustre when he was called on to act as the pacificator of the\r\nworld after the fall of Paris. But subsequent experience convinced him\r\nof the extreme danger of prematurely transplanting the institutions of\r\none country into another in a different stage of civilisation; and his\r\nlater years were chiefly directed to objects of practical improvement,\r\nand the preparation of his subjects, by the extension of knowledge and\r\nthe firmness of government, for those privileges which, if suddenly\r\nconferred, would have involved in equal ruin his empire and himself.[g]\r\n\r\n\r\nSKRINE’S ESTIMATE OF ALEXANDER I\r\n\r\nOf Alexander I it may be truly said that no monarch ever wielded\r\nunlimited power with a loftier resolve to promote the happiness of his\r\npeople. And not theirs alone; for he sympathised with all the myriads\r\ndoomed to suffering by false ideals and effete institutions. In him men\r\nsaw the long-expected Messiah who was to give peace to a distracted\r\nworld. But his nature had an alloy of feminine weakness, unfitting him to\r\nbear the reformer’s cross. He was too sensitive of impressions derived\r\nfrom without; too easily led by counsellors who gained his confidence\r\nbut were not always worthy of it. In youth he was swayed by noble\r\ninfatuations and enamoured of the most diverse ideas in turn. But when he\r\nstood confronted with a crisis in his country’s fortunes he rose superior\r\nto vacillation and kept a great design steadily in view. The will-power\r\nthus developed, and the resources at his command, made him for a brief\r\nperiod the leading figure in the civilised world. Despondency came with\r\nthe inevitable reaction which followed the effort. He was drawn into the\r\nmazes of German illuminism, which lessened his capacity for persistent\r\nresolve. Its effect was heightened by his failure to pierce the dense\r\nphalanxes of ignorance around him, and by the unvarying ingratitude which\r\nrequited his efforts for the public weal. Increasing physical weakness\r\nhastened the death of his generous illusions. An excessive devotion to\r\nduty exhausted his flagging powers and he became unequal to the task of\r\ngoverning all the Russias. As a dying tree is strangled by parasitical\r\ngrowths, so was Alexander in his decadence attacked by the enemies of\r\nhuman progress. When Metternich and Araktcheiev gained the mastery, all\r\nhope of domestic reform and consistent foreign policy disappeared. But\r\ndespite the shadows which darkened his declining years, Alexander I of\r\nRussia will stand out in history as one of the few men born in the purple\r\nwho rightly appraised the accident of birth and the externals of imperial\r\nrank; who held opinions far in advance of his age, and never wittingly\r\nabused his limitless powers; who displayed equal firmness in danger and\r\nmagnanimity in the hour of triumph.[h]\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES\r\n\r\n[60] In the year 1812 Alexander had granted a charter to the Jesuit\r\nCollege of Polotsk, raising it to the rank of an “academy” and giving\r\nit rights and privileges equal to those of the university; he was then\r\nprobably governed by political considerations concerning Poland, and\r\nin the charter he refers to the college as “affording great advantages\r\nfor the education of youth” and trusts that the “Jesuits will labour in\r\nPoland _dans le bon sens_” (along the right lines.)\r\n\r\n[61] Much earlier, in 1807, the emperor had expressed himself to General\r\nSavari upon this question in the following words: “I want to bring the\r\ncountry out of the state of barbarism in which this traffic in men leaves\r\nit. I will say more--if civilisation were more advanced, I would abolish\r\nthis slavery even if it were to cost me my head.”\r\n\r\n[62] Étienne de Grelle Mobillier was born in France in 1760 and was\r\nbrought up in the Roman Catholic faith. At the beginning of the French\r\nRevolution he went to America and there entered the society of Friends\r\nor Quakers.

THE REIGN OF NICHOLAS I\r\n\r\n    Nicholas Pavlovitch triumphed over two military revolts;\r\n    then, as if the twelve days’ interregnum had not existed, he\r\n    dated his reign from the 1st of December, 1825, the day of\r\n    Alexander’s death. During the first ten or twelve years of his\r\n    reign embarrassments of every kind, followed hard upon one\r\n    another. These embarrassments were foreign war, first with\r\n    Persia, and next with Turkey; the enmity of Austria whilst this\r\n    latter struggle was going on; the abandonment of the Russian\r\n    alliance by France, in consequence of the revolution of July,\r\n    1830; the insurrection of Poland; the epidemic of Asiatic\r\n    cholera in 1831 and the popular riots to which this scourge\r\n    gave rise, especially in St. Petersburg; a revolt in the heart\r\n    of the military colonies; a famine which desolated the southern\r\n    provinces during the years 1834 and 1835; the fires at Åbo,\r\n    Tula, Kazan, and at last (December, 1837) at the emperor’s own\r\n    residence, the Winter Palace. But all these cruel trials did\r\n    not daunt the courage of the new autocrat; they served only to\r\n    bring out the firmness of his mind and the strong cast of his\r\n    character.--SCHNITZLER.[c]\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE INTERREGNUM\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [1825-1855 A.D.]]\r\n\r\nAfter the 24th of November, 1825, Adjutant-general Diebitsch had begun to\r\nsend information to Warsaw of the illness of the emperor Alexander, by\r\nmeans of letters addressed to General Kuruta. The first courier, bearing\r\nthis alarming news, arrived at Warsaw on the 1st of December in the\r\nevening of the very day of the emperor Alexander’s death.\r\n\r\nThe czarevitch Constantine Pavlovitch did not conceal the painful\r\npresentiment that took possession of him, and wrote to Baron Diebitsch\r\nthe same day in the following terms: “In spite of all the consolations\r\nexpressed in your letter, I cannot rid myself of the painful impression\r\nit has produced on me. I tell you frankly that if I were to obey the\r\ndictates of my heart I should set off and come to you. But unfortunately\r\nmy duties and my position do not permit me to give way to these natural\r\nsentiments.”\r\n\r\nThe grand duke Michael Pavlovitch was at that time at Warsaw, and\r\nthe czarevitch hid even from him and Princess Lovitch the alarming\r\nletters that he received from Taganrog. “I do not speak to you of the\r\ncondition of mind in which I now find myself,” wrote the czarevitch to\r\nAdjutant-general Diebitsch on the 5th of December, “for you know only too\r\nwell of my devotion and sincere attachment to the best of brothers and\r\nmonarchs to doubt them. My position is rendered all the more painful\r\nfrom the fact that, the emperor’s illness is only known to me and my old\r\nfriend Kuruta and my doctor; the news has not yet reached here, so that\r\nin society I have to appear calm, although there is no such calmness in\r\nmy soul. My wife and brother do not suspect anything, so that I had to\r\ninvent an explanation for the arrival of your first messenger, which I\r\nshall have to do again to-day. If I were to obey only the suggestions of\r\nmy heart of course I should have been with you long ago, but you will\r\nnaturally understand what hinders me.”\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [1825 A.D.]]\r\n\r\nMeanwhile couriers continued to follow upon each others’ heels and\r\nfinally on December 7th, at seven in the evening, the czarevitch received\r\nthe fatal intelligence of the death of his brother. The report of\r\nAdjutant-general Diebitsch did not shake the czarevitch’s decision as to\r\nthe question of the succession to the throne, and he then said to the\r\ngrand duke Michael Pavlovitch, “Now the solemn moment has come to show\r\nthat my previous mode of action was not a mask, and to terminate the\r\nmatter with the same firmness with which it was commenced. My intentions\r\nand my determinations have not changed one iota, and my will to renounce\r\nthe throne is more unchangeable than ever.”\r\n\r\nSummoning the persons of his entourage and informing them of the loss\r\nthat had overtaken Russia, the czarevitch read them his correspondence\r\nwith the emperor Alexander in 1822 and ordered that letters to the\r\nempress Marie Feodorovna, and to the grand duke Nicholas Pavlovitch,\r\nshould be prepared, stating that he ceded his rights to the succession\r\nto the throne to his younger brother, by virtue of the rescript of the\r\nemperor Alexander of the 14th of February, 1822. The czarevitch here used\r\nthe expression “cede the throne to the grand duke Nicholas Pavlovitch,”\r\nbecause he knew nothing of the existence of the state act which as long\r\nago as 1824 had invested this cession with the power of a law. Such were\r\nthe misapprehensions with which was accompanied Alexander’s secret and\r\nevasive manner of action in regard to the question of the succession.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile what was taking place in St. Petersburg? The news of the death\r\nof the emperor Alexander was received in the capital only on December\r\n9th, during prayers which were being said for the recovery of the emperor\r\nin the church of the Winter Palace. The circumstances are thus narrated\r\nby the empress Elizabeth Alexievna herself:\r\n\r\nOn the 9th inst. at the termination of the liturgy, when prayers for the\r\nhealth of the emperor had already commenced, his highness was called out\r\nfrom the sacristy by Count Miloradovitch and informed by him that all\r\nwas over. His imperial highness became faint, but recovering himself\r\nhe returned with Doctor Rule to the sacristy. The empress was on her\r\nknees and being already prepared by the grand duke’s prolonged absence,\r\nand guessing her lot from his face she grew faint; meanwhile the priest\r\npresented the cross to her, and as she kissed it she lost consciousness.\r\n\r\nHis imperial highness, turning to his wife, said to her “Take care of our\r\nmother, and I will go and do my duty.” With these words he entered the\r\nchurch, ordered that a reading desk should be brought in, and took the\r\noath of allegiance to his beloved brother and emperor, Constantine, which\r\nhe ratified by his signature; some others who happened to be there also\r\nsubscribed to the same: they were the minister of war Tatistchev, General\r\nKutusov, the general in waiting Potapov, and all the others who were\r\npresent.\r\n\r\nThen he presented himself before the Preobrajenski regiment that was\r\non guard in the palace (the company of his majesty’s grenadiers),\r\nand informed them of the emperor’s death and proclaimed Constantine\r\nemperor. The grenadiers received the announcement with tears, and\r\nimmediately took the oath of allegiance. After this his imperial highness\r\ncommissioned the general in waiting, Potapov, to inform the chief and all\r\nthe other guards of what had taken place and to bring them from their\r\nposts to take the oath, which was done without delay and with sorrow and\r\nzeal; meanwhile General Neitgart was sent to the Nevski monastery, where\r\nwere all the general officers of the guards’ corps, with the proposal to\r\nGeneral Voinov to do the same throughout all the regiments of the guards.\r\nFinally similar announcements and instructions were sent to all the\r\nregiments and detachments in both the city and its environs.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the council of the state had assembled and opened its sitting\r\nby the proposal to break the seals of the envelope which contained the\r\nwill of the late emperor. Some discussion arose, and finally it was\r\ndecided to unseal the packet, in order to learn the last will of the czar.\r\n\r\nIn the act was drawn up the renunciation of the throne by the czarevitch\r\nand the nomination of the grand duke Nicholas as the emperor’s heir.\r\nSome discussion again arose upon this question, but it was cut short by\r\nthe suggestion that his highness should be invited into the presence of\r\nthe council. Count Miloradovitch replied that his highness had already\r\ntaken the oath and that in any case he considered it unfitting that his\r\nhighness should be called, or should come to the council, but offered to\r\nbring all this to his knowledge and to ask that they might be allowed to\r\ncome to him in order to report all that had taken place; this was done\r\nand the grand duke replied that he could not hinder their coming.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: NICHOLAS I\r\n\r\n(1796-1855)]\r\n\r\nWhen the members of the council presented themselves before the grand\r\nduke he informed them that the contents of the act had long been known\r\nto him, namely since July 25th, 1819, but that in no case would he dare\r\nto occupy the place of his elder brother, from whose supreme will his\r\nlot depended, and that holding it as a sacred obligation most humbly to\r\nobey him in all things, he had therefore taken the oath and felt entirely\r\ncertain that the council, having in view the welfare of the state, would\r\nfollow his example.\r\n\r\nThe council followed his highness into the church and at his request took\r\nthe oath before him; they were then introduced by him into the presence\r\nof the empress mother, who was pleased to inform them that the act and\r\nits content were known to her, and were made with her maternal consent,\r\nbut that she also was enthusiastic over her son’s conduct. Confirming\r\nall his actions she requested the council by their united endeavours to\r\npreserve the tranquillity of the empire.\r\n\r\nIn accordance with the measures taken, by three o’clock in the afternoon\r\nthe troops as well as all grades of officials in the government service\r\nhad taken the oath confirming the accession to the throne of the emperor\r\nConstantine. During the whole time tranquillity and order were preserved.\r\nIt is easy to imagine the astonishment and vexation of the czarevitch\r\nwhen, instead of receiving the expected commands of the new emperor,\r\nhe was informed that all Russia had taken the oath of allegiance to him\r\nas lawful sovereign, and that the will of the late emperor had not been\r\nfulfilled.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile early in the morning of December 15th the grand duke Michael\r\nPavlovitch arrived in St. Petersburg with letters from the czarevitch.\r\nTo the amazement of the court and the inhabitants, the grand duke did\r\nnot follow the general example of swearing fidelity to the emperor\r\nConstantine. He did not conceal his regret at what had taken place in\r\nSt. Petersburg, nor the apprehension with which the necessity of a new\r\noath filled him. He dwelt on the difficulty of explaining to the public\r\nwhy the place of the elder brother to whom allegiance had already been\r\nsworn should suddenly be taken by the younger. The grand duke Nicholas\r\nin answer to his brother repeated what he had already said, that he\r\ncould not have acted otherwise in such a position as that in which he\r\nwas placed by his ignorance of the sacred acts of the late emperor, and\r\nthat neither his conscience nor his reason reproached him. “Everything,\r\nhowever,” added he, “might yet be amended and take a more favourable turn\r\nif the czarevitch himself were to come to St. Petersburg; his obstinacy\r\nin remaining at Warsaw may occasion disasters, the possibility of which I\r\ndo not deny, but of which in all probability I shall myself be the first\r\nvictim.”\r\n\r\nAfter long deliberation the grand duke Nicholas decided to write a fresh\r\npersuasive letter to the emperor Constantine, in which he asked him to\r\ndecide finally what his fate was to be; and in conclusion he wrote, “In\r\nGod’s name, come.” The empress Marie Feodorovna added her persuasions to\r\nthose of her son, and not satisfied with these measures it was decided a\r\nfew days later to despatch the grand duke Michael to Warsaw to convince\r\nthe czarevitch of the necessity of his presence in St. Petersburg.\r\n\r\nAn answer from the czarevitch to the grand duke Nicholas’ letter\r\ndated the 14th of December was brought to St. Petersburg by Lazarev,\r\naid-de-camp to Nicholas: “Your aide-de-camp, dear Nicholas, on his\r\narrival here, confided your letter to me with all exactitude. I read\r\nit with the deepest grief and sorrow. My decision is unalterable and\r\nconsecrated by my late benefactor the emperor and sovereign. Your\r\ninvitation to come quickly cannot be accepted by me, and I must tell you\r\nthat I shall remove myself yet further away, if all is not arranged in\r\naccordance with the will of our late emperor. Your faithful and sincere\r\nfriend and brother for life.” But even this letter did not decide the\r\nmatter; the return of Belussov from Warsaw with the answer to the grand\r\nduke Nicholas’ letter of December 15th had yet to be awaited.\r\n\r\nA new complication remained to be added to all these difficulties. On\r\nDecember 24th there came to St. Petersburg and presented himself to the\r\ngrand duke Nicholas, Colonel Baron Fredericks of the Izmailovski Life\r\nGuards, who had fulfilled the functions of commandant in Taganrog. He\r\nbrought to the grand duke a packet from Baron Diebitsch addressed to his\r\nimperial majesty, to be given into his own hands. To the question as to\r\nwhether he knew of the contents of the packet, Fredericks replied in the\r\nnegative, but added that as the place of residence of the emperor was\r\nunknown in Taganrog, exactly the same paper had been sent also to Warsaw.\r\n\r\nNothing therefore remained for Nicholas to do but to open the mysterious\r\npacket and “at the first rapid glance over its contents,” writes Baron\r\nKorv, “an inexpressible horror took possession of him.” It was on reading\r\nthe report contained in this packet that the grand duke first learned of\r\nthe existence of secret societies formed with the object of destroying\r\nto the very roots the tranquillity of the empire. The existence of\r\nthese societies had been carefully hidden from him by the late emperor\r\nAlexander.\r\n\r\nAlmost immediately thereafter the courier Belussov returned from\r\nWarsaw with the czarevitch’s decisive answer, which put an end to the\r\ninterregnum. Nicholas Pavlovitch was emperor. At nine o’clock in the\r\nevening the emperor sent the following postscript to Adjutant-general\r\nDiebitsch:\r\n\r\n    The decisive courier has returned; by the morning of the day\r\n    after to-morrow I shall be emperor or else dead. I sacrifice\r\n    myself for my brother; happy if as a subject I fulfil his\r\n    will. But how will it be with Russia? What about the army?\r\n    General Tolle is here and I shall send him to Mohilev to bear\r\n    the news to Count Saken. I am looking out for a trustworthy\r\n    person for the same commission to Tultchin and to Ermolov. In\r\n    a word, I hope to be worthy of my calling, not in fear and\r\n    mistrustfulness, but in the hope that even as I fulfil my\r\n    duty so will others fulfil their duty to me. But if anywhere\r\n    anything is brewing and you hear of it, I authorise you to go\r\n    at once where your presence is necessary. I rely entirely upon\r\n    you and give you leave beforehand to take all the measures\r\n    you deem necessary. The day after to-morrow if I am alive I\r\n    will send you, I do not know by whom, information as to how\r\n    matters have passed off; on your part do not leave me without\r\n    news of how everything is going on around you, especially with\r\n    Ermolov. I again repeat that here until now everything is\r\n    incomprehensibly quiet, but calm often precedes a storm. Enough\r\n    of this, God’s will be done! In me there must only be seen the\r\n    vicar and executor of the late emperor’s will and therefore\r\n    I am ready for everything. I shall ever be your sincere well\r\n    wisher,\r\n\r\n                                                           NICHOLAS.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ACCESSION OF NICHOLAS\r\n\r\nThe czarevitch’s decisive answer was brought by Belussov, not through\r\nRiga, but by the Brest-Lithuani road; and therefore the grand duke\r\nMichael Pavlovitch was still in ignorance of the events at Nennal. The\r\nemperor Nicholas immediately sent an express after him commanding him to\r\nhasten to St. Petersburg. The return of the grand duke to the capital\r\nwhere his presence was of urgent necessity was thus by chance delayed.\r\n\r\nNicholas had now to occupy himself with the composition of his manifesto;\r\nthe inexplicable had to be explained and it presented a task of no\r\nlittle difficulty: Karamzin and Speranski were set to work upon it.\r\nThe emperor Nicholas signed the manifesto on the 25th of December, but\r\ndated it the 24th, as the day on which the question of his accession had\r\nbeen definitely settled by the czarevitch. It was proposed to keep the\r\nmanifesto secret until the arrival of the grand duke Michael, but it was\r\ndecided that the troops should take the oath of allegiance on the 26th of\r\nDecember; meanwhile notifications were sent to the members of the council\r\nof state, calling upon them to assemble on Sunday, December 25th, at\r\neight in the evening, for a general secret meeting.\r\n\r\nWhen the council of state had assembled at the hour designated, Prince\r\nSopukhin announced that the grand duke Michael would be present at the\r\nsitting. The hours passed in anxious expectation; midnight approached\r\nand the expected arrival of the grand duke did not take place. Then\r\nNicholas decided to be present at the sitting alone. Taking the place of\r\nthe president, Nicholas himself began to read the manifesto announcing\r\nhis acceptance of the imperial dignity in consequence of the persisted\r\nrejection of it by the czarevitch Constantine Pavlovitch. Then the\r\nemperor ordered that the czarevitch’s rescript, addressed to Prince\r\nSopukhin, president of the council, should be read. The 26th of December,\r\n1825, had come. Commands had been issued that on that day all persons\r\nhaving access to the court should assemble at the Winter Palace for a _Te\r\nDeum_; eleven o’clock was the hour first named, but this was afterwards\r\nchanged to two. Circumstances arose, however, which postponed the _Te\r\nDeum_ to a still later hour. The members of the secret society decided\r\nto take advantage of the end of the interregnum and the approach of the\r\nnew oath of allegiance in order to incite the troops to rebellion and to\r\noverthrow the existing order of things in Russia. The secrecy in which\r\nthe negotiations with Russia had been enveloped had given occasion for\r\nvarious rumours and suppositions, and for the spread of false reports\r\nwhich occasioned alarm in society and especially in the barracks: all\r\nthis favoured the undertakings and designs of the conspirators.\r\n\r\nThe only issue from the position that had been created by Nicholas in\r\na moment of chivalrous enthusiasm “undoubtedly noble, but perhaps not\r\nentirely wise,” would have been the arrival of the grand duke Constantine\r\nin the capital with the object of publicly and solemnly proclaiming his\r\nrenunciation of the throne. But the czarevitch flatly refused to employ\r\nthis means of extricating his brother from the difficult position in\r\nwhich he placed himself; Constantine considered that it was not for him\r\nto suffer from the consequences of an imprudence which was not his, and\r\nthe danger of which might have been averted if matters had not been\r\nhurried on, and if he had been previously applied to for advice and\r\ninstructions. Thus led into error, some of the lower ranks of the guards’\r\nregiments refused to take the oath of allegiance to Nicholas Pavlovitch,\r\nand assembled at the Pelrovski square, before the senate buildings,\r\nappearing as though they were the defenders of the lawful rights of the\r\nczarevitch Constantine to the throne.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile distinguished persons of both sexes began to drive up to the\r\nWinter Palace. Amidst the general stir and movement going on in the\r\npalace, there sat isolated and immoveable three magnates, “like three\r\nmonuments,” writes Karamzin: Prince Lopukhin, Count Araktcheiev, and\r\nPrince A. B. Kurakin. At the time when the military men had already\r\ngone out on the square, Count Araktcheiev, as might have been expected,\r\npreferred to remain in the palace. “It was pitiful to look at him,”\r\nwrites V. R. Martchenko in his _Mémoires_.\r\n\r\nThe rioters were stubborn for a long time and would not yield to\r\nexhortation; Count Miloradovitch fell mortally wounded. It began to grow\r\ndusk. Then the emperor Nicholas, at last convinced of the impossibility\r\nof pacifying the rioters without bloodshed, gave orders with a breaking\r\nheart for the artillery to fire. A few grape-shot decided the fate of the\r\nday; the rioters were dispersed, and tranquillity at once reigned in the\r\ncapital.\r\n\r\nThe _Te Deum_ announced could take place only at half past six. The\r\ntroops bivouacked round the palace. “Dear, dear Constantine,” wrote the\r\nemperor the same evening to the czarevitch, “your will is fulfilled: I\r\nam emperor, but at what price, my God!--at the price of the blood of my\r\nsubjects.” Arrests were made during that night and investigations pursued\r\nto discover the leaders of the revolt. And thus in the troubles of the\r\n26th of December, the 1st of December, 1825, was terribly recalled.\r\n“The day was one of misfortune for Russia,” writes Prince Viasenski,\r\n“and the epoch which it signalised in such a bloody manner was an awful\r\njudgment for deeds, opinions, and ideas, rooted in the past and governing\r\nthe present.” According to the words of Karamzin, on that day Russia\r\nwas saved from a calamity “which, if it had not destroyed her, would\r\ncertainly have torn her to pieces.” “If I am emperor even for an hour, I\r\nwill show that I was worthy of it”; thus spoke Nicholas on the morning of\r\nDecember 26th to the commanders of the guard regiments assembled at the\r\nWinter Palace; and on that awful day he triumphantly justified his first\r\nand impressive words.\r\n\r\n\r\nTRIAL OF THE CONSPIRATORS (1826 A.D.)\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [1826 A.D.]]\r\n\r\nThe emperor Nicholas gave all possible publicity to the proceedings\r\nagainst the secret societies, the Southern, Northern, the United\r\nSlavonians, and the Polish; then the whole matter was transferred to\r\nthe supreme criminal court, which had to pronounce sentence on the\r\nprincipal participators in the conspiracy. Of the accused, Rileeks,\r\nMuraviev-Alostob, Bestuzhev-Riumin, Pesteb, and Kakhovski were condemned\r\nto death, and the remaining members of the secret societies brought\r\nbefore the court were exiled to Siberia or other places of incarceration.\r\n\r\nNo one had expected such a termination to the affair. During the whole\r\nof Alexander’s reign there had not been one case of capital punishment,\r\nand it was looked upon as entirely abolished. “It is impossible to\r\ndescribe in words the horror and despair which have taken possession of\r\nall,” writes a contemporary and eye witness of the events of 1826 in\r\nMoscow. This frame of mind was reflected in the coronation ceremonies.\r\nThe emperor Nicholas appeared extremely gloomy; the future seemed more\r\nsad and fuller of anxiety than ever; all was in sharp contrast to the\r\nenthusiasm and hopes that had accompanied the coronation of Alexander in\r\n1801.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CORONATION OF NICHOLAS (1826 A.D.)\r\n\r\nImmediately after the termination of the trial of the Dekabrists, the\r\ncourt proceeded to Moscow for the approaching coronation, which took\r\nplace on the 3rd of September. Previously the emperor was rejoiced at the\r\nunexpected arrival of the grand duke Constantine Pavlovitch. According\r\nto Benkendorf “the czarevitch’s appearance was a brilliant public\r\ntestimony of his submission to the new emperor and of his conscientious\r\nrenunciation of the throne; it was at the same time a precious pledge of\r\nthe harmony which bound together all the members of the reigning family,\r\na harmony conducive to the peace of the empire. The public was delighted\r\nand the _corps diplomatique_ completely astounded. The people expressed\r\ntheir satisfaction to the czarevitch by unanimous acclamations, whilst\r\nthe dignitaries of the state surrounded him with marks of respectful\r\nveneration.”\r\n\r\nThe day of the coronation was signalised by an important reform in\r\nthe administration of the court; the ministry of the imperial court\r\nwas created, and confided to Prince P. M. Volkonski. Thus the old and\r\ntried companion of the emperor Alexander I again occupied the post\r\nof a trusty dignitary by the side of his successor. Prince Volkonski\r\nremained minister of the court until his decease, which took place in\r\n1852. Amongst the favours and the mitigations of punishments which were\r\ngranted on the 3rd of September, the state criminals who had lately\r\nbeen condemned were not forgotten; by special ukases the sentences of\r\nall those sent to the galleys, to penal settlements, and hard labour\r\nwere mitigated. Those who had been sent to the Siberian, Orenburg, and\r\nCaucasian garrisons, both with and without deprivation of the rights of\r\nnobility, were enrolled in the regiments of the Caucasian corps.\r\n\r\nDuring the emperor’s stay in Moscow, the poet Pushkin, who had been\r\nbanished to the village of Mikhailovski, was recalled. From that moment\r\nhe regained his lost liberty, besides which the emperor Nicholas said to\r\nhim: “In future you are to send me all you write--henceforth I will be\r\nyour censor.”\r\n\r\n\r\nCHANGES IN INTERNAL ADMINISTRATION\r\n\r\nOn the 18th of October, 1826, the emperor Nicholas returned to St.\r\nPetersburg; although his accession to the throne did not constitute the\r\nopening of a new era for Russia, yet certain changes were made in the\r\nsystem of administration which had prevailed during the last decade of\r\nthe reign of Alexander I. After Count Araktcheiev had been relieved of\r\nthe management of the general affairs of the state, it was to be foreseen\r\nthat he would not remain long at the head of the direction of the\r\nmilitary settlements. And thus it turned out. In the spring of 1826 Count\r\nAraktcheiev, on account of illness, was given leave to go abroad. In the\r\nreport presented by him on this occasion to the emperor he announced\r\nto him economies of more than 32,000,000 rubles made on the military\r\nsettlements, and concluded his epistle by observing, “Those impartial\r\njudges--posterity and the future--will pronounce a just sentence on all\r\nthings.”\r\n\r\nOn the return of Count Araktcheiev in the autumn from his travels abroad\r\nhe did not again take up his duties. In accordance with a ukase which\r\nthen followed, the staff office of the military settlements was united\r\nto the general staff of his imperial majesty, under the jurisdiction\r\nof its adjutant-general Baron Diebitsch. At the same time the Novgorod\r\nmilitary settlement passed under the entire direction of General Prince\r\nSchahovski, who was nominated commander of the grenadier corps; the\r\nKherson and Iekaterinoslav settlements were put under the supervision of\r\ntheir chief, Count Vitt (who was also commander of a separate corps),\r\nwhile the settlements in the villages of the Ukraine and Mohilev\r\ngovernments remained under the jurisdiction of their former chiefs, who\r\nbore the rank of commanders of divisions. Count Araktcheiev, when he\r\nhad finally bidden adieu to his administrative career, settled on his\r\nGeorgian estates, where he died in 1834.\r\n\r\nHaving delivered Russia from the administrative guardianship of Count\r\nAraktcheiev, the emperor Nicholas, in addition, delivered Russian\r\ninstruction from the influence of Michael Leontievitch Magnitzki. On\r\nthe 18th of May, 1826, a ukase was issued in which it was stated that\r\n“the curator of the University of Kazan and of its educational district,\r\nthe actual councillor of state Magnitzki, is by our command relieved\r\nof his functions and of his position as member of the administration\r\nof schools.” But the matter was not limited to this ukase. Magnitzki\r\ncontinued to live in Kazan and in accordance with his character he\r\ncontinued to intrigue as usual and indirectly to influence the university\r\nhe had left. General Jeltukhin, who had been commissioned to make a\r\ndetailed revision of the Kazan University, brought this fact to the\r\nemperor’s knowledge. Nicholas’ reply was rapid and decisive; a courier\r\nwas sent with orders to the governor to arrest Magnitzki and send him to\r\nRevel under the surveillance of the commandant. Magnitzki lived there six\r\nyears, having given his promise not to absent himself.\r\n\r\nAn equally sad fate overtook the champion and imitator of Magnitzki,\r\nDmitri Pavlovitch Runitch, who had filled the office of curator of the\r\nSt. Petersburg educational district. By a ukase of the 7th of July, 1826,\r\nRunitch was deprived of his functions and of the position of member of\r\nthe chief administration of schools, for his incompetence in the matter\r\nof the direction of the St. Petersburg educational district. The requital\r\nexperienced by Runitch for his educational labours was a terrible one; he\r\nlanguished beneath the consequences for sixteen years and died in 1860 in\r\nthe conviction that he had formerly saved Russia, and was suffering for\r\nthe good work he had accomplished in the University of St. Petersburg.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Reforms in the Administration of Justice_\r\n\r\nThe lamentable condition of the administration of justice in Russia was\r\none of the first subjects to which the careful attention of the emperor\r\nNicholas was directed. In a speech pronounced by the sovereign many years\r\nlater, in 1833, before the council of state, Nicholas Pavlovitch thus\r\nexpressed himself:\r\n\r\n“From my very accession to the throne I was obliged to turn my attention\r\nto various administrative matters, of which I had scarcely any notion.\r\nThe chief subject that occupied me was naturally legislation. Even\r\nfrom my early youth I had constantly heard of our deficiencies in this\r\nrespect, of chicanery, of extortion, of the insufficiency of the existing\r\nlaws or of their admixture through the extraordinary number of ukases\r\nwhich were not infrequently in contradiction to one another. This incited\r\nme from the very first days of my reign to examine into the state of the\r\ncommission appointed for the constitution of the laws. To my regret, the\r\ninformation presented to me proved to me that its labours had remained\r\nalmost fruitless. It was not difficult to discover the cause of this: the\r\ndeficient results proceeded chiefly from the fact that the commission\r\nalways directed its attention to the formation of new laws, when in\r\nreality the old ones should have been established on a firm foundation.\r\nThis inspired me above all with a desire to establish a definite aim\r\ntowards which the government must direct its actions in the matter of\r\nlegislation; from the methods proposed to me I selected one in entire\r\nopposition to the former methods of reform. Instead of drawing up new\r\nlaws, I commanded that first those which already existed should be\r\ncollected and set in order, whilst I took the matter itself, on account\r\nof its great importance, under my own immediate direction and closed the\r\nprevious commission.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MARRIED WOMAN OF VALDAI]\r\n\r\nWith this object was formed and opened on the 6th of May, 1826,\r\nthe “second section of his imperial majesty’s own chancery.” M. A.\r\nBalongianski was appointed chief of the second section, but in reality\r\nthe work itself was confided to Speranski. The emperor’s choice rested\r\non the latter, out of necessity, as he did not find anyone more capable\r\naround him. When Balongianski was appointed chief of the second section,\r\nthe emperor, in conversing with his former tutor, said to him, speaking\r\nof Speranski: “See that he does not play any pranks, as in 1810.”\r\nNevertheless, in proportion to Speranski’s successful accomplishment\r\nof the work confided to him, the emperor Nicholas’ prejudices against\r\nhim gradually softened and finally gave way to sincere favour and full\r\nconfidence. All the accusations and calumnies directed against Speranski\r\nwere, in accordance with the emperor’s own expression, “scattered like\r\ndust.”\r\n\r\nThus the emperor Nicholas in his almost involuntary choice was favoured\r\nby a peculiarly fortunate chance and could hardly have found a person\r\nbetter fitted for the accomplishment of the work he had planned. The\r\nresults of Speranski’s fresh efforts, under completely different\r\ncircumstances from those against which he had formerly contended, were\r\nthe “complete collection of laws,” and a systematic code.\r\n\r\nEven before the termination of the trial of the Dekabrists, the emperor\r\nNicholas took another important measure, which left an imprint on all the\r\nsucceeding years of his reign and is directly connected with the events\r\nof the 26th of December. On the 15th of July, 1826, a supreme edict was\r\nissued in the name of the minister of the interior Lanskoi, by which the\r\nprivate chancery of that ministry was abolished and transformed into the\r\nthird section of his imperial majesty’s own chancery. In fulfilment of\r\nthis ukase, it was prescribed that the governors of provinces, in matters\r\nwhich entered within the sphere of the former division, should no longer\r\npresent their reports to the ministry of the interior, but should submit\r\nthem directly to his majesty.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A WOMAN (SAILOR) OF THE NOGAI TRIBE]\r\n\r\nSome days before, on the emperor Nicholas’ birthday, the 6th of July, a\r\nsupreme order appeared naming the chief of the first cuirassier division,\r\nAdjutant-general Benkendorf, chief of the gendarmerie and commandant\r\nof the emperor’s headquarters; to him was confided the direction of\r\nthe third section. Adjutant-general Benkendorf explains in his memoirs\r\nin the following manner the reasons for establishing the institution\r\nconfided to his direction: “The emperor Nicholas aimed at the extirpation\r\nof the abuses that had crept into many branches of the administration,\r\nand was convinced by the sudden discovery of the conspiracy which had\r\nstained the first moments of the new reign with blood, of the necessity\r\nof a universal and more diligent surveillance. The emperor chose me to\r\norganise a higher police, which should protect the oppressed and guard\r\nthe nation against conspiracies and conspirators. Never having thought\r\nof preparing myself for this sort of service, I had hardly the most\r\nsuperficial understanding of it; but the noble and beneficent motives\r\nwhich inspired the sovereign in his creation of this institution and the\r\ndesire to be of use to him, forbade me to evade the duty to which his\r\nhigh confidence had called me. I set to work without delay and God helped\r\nme to fulfil my new duties to the satisfaction of the emperor and without\r\nsetting general opinion against me. I succeeded in showing favours to\r\nmany, in discovering many conspiracies, and averting much evil.” With the\r\ncreation of the new third section, the committee of the 13th of January,\r\n1807, established by the emperor Alexander, became superfluous; and on\r\nthe 29th of January a ukase was issued closing it.\r\n\r\nThe disturbances of the year 1825 did not pass without leaving traces\r\non the peasant population; a momentary confusion ensued, freedom was\r\ntalked of, and disorders arose in some provinces--a phenomenon often\r\nseen in previous times. The movement amongst the peasants incited the\r\nemperor Nicholas to publish, on the 24th of May, 1826, a manifesto in\r\nwhich it was declared that all “talk of exempting the villagers in the\r\nstate settlements from paying taxes and of freeing landowner’s peasants\r\nand menials from subjection to their landowners are false rumours,\r\nimagined and spread by evil intentioned persons out of mere cupidity\r\nwith the object of enriching themselves through these rumours at the\r\nexpense of the peasants, by taking advantage of their simplicity.” It\r\nwas further said in the manifesto that all classes throughout the empire\r\nmust absolutely submit to the authorities placed over them, and that\r\ndisturbers of the public tranquillity would be prosecuted and punished in\r\naccordance with the full severity of the laws. It was commanded that the\r\nmanifesto should be read in all the churches and at the markets and fairs\r\nduring a space of six months; the governors of provinces were sternly\r\nadmonished to be watchful in anticipating disorders.\r\n\r\nIf, however, the emperor Nicholas was forced by circumstances to\r\npromulgate this punitive manifesto, he also issued two rescripts in\r\nthe name of the minister of the interior, enjoining upon the nobility\r\nbehaviour towards their peasants, which should be in accordance with the\r\nlaws of Christianity, thus clearly expressing his desire to protect the\r\npeasant against the arbitrariness and tyranny of the landowners. “In all\r\ncases,” wrote the emperor: “I find it, and shall ever find it, better to\r\nprevent evil, than to pursue it by punishment when it has already arisen.”\r\n\r\nFinally the solicitude of the emperor Nicholas for the peasant classes\r\nmanifested itself by yet another action. On the 18th of December, 1826, a\r\nspecial secret committee was formed to which was confided the inspection\r\nof the entire state organisation and administration, with the order\r\nto represent the conclusions it arrived at as to the changes deemed\r\nnecessary; the labours of the committee were to be directed also to the\r\nconsideration of the peasant question. Besides this the emperor did not\r\nleave without attention what had been said by the Dekabrists, during the\r\ntime of their examination before a committee of inquiry, in regard to the\r\ninternal conditions of the state in the reign of Alexander I. The emperor\r\nordered a separate memorandum of these opinions to be drawn up for him\r\nand often perused this curious document, from which he extracted much\r\nthat was pertinent.[b]\r\n\r\n\r\nWAR WITH PERSIA (1826-1828 A.D.)\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [1826-1828 A.D.]]\r\n\r\nThe shah of Persia thought he saw in the change of rulers and the\r\ntroubles by which it was accompanied circumstances favourable to the\r\nrecovery of the provinces ceded to Russia by the Treaty of Gulistan. In\r\nAugust, 1826, he ordered his troops to move forward. The solemnity of\r\nhis coronation, which was then being celebrated and whose splendour was\r\nenhanced by the presence of the czarevitch, did not prevent Nicholas from\r\npromptly organising the defence of the empire. A few weeks afterwards\r\nGeneral Paskevitch defeated the Persians at Ielisavetpol, and in the\r\nfollowing year, transferring the theatre of war to the enemy’s territory,\r\nhe seized the celebrated convent of Etchmiadzine, the seat of the\r\nArmenian patriarch, and Erivan, one of the great towns of Armenia; he\r\nmoreover penetrated as far as Tauris, capital of the Azerbaijan and\r\nresidence of the prince royal, Abbas Mirza. Then the shah asked for\r\npeace. It was signed at Turkmantchaï, the 22nd of February, 1828, and\r\nadvanced Russia as far as the line of the Araxes, by giving up to her the\r\nprovinces of Erivan and Nakhitchevan.\r\n\r\n\r\nWAR WITH TURKEY (1828-1829 A.D.)\r\n\r\nThis treaty was concluded, to the great regret of Persia, when the war\r\nwith Turkey broke out. This war had been threatening for years; for,\r\ndeeply affected by the violences to which the Greeks in the Ottoman\r\nEmpire had been exposed ever since the hetaerist insurrection of 1821,\r\nand by the martyrdom which the Greek patriarch had been made to suffer,\r\nAlexander left the sword in its sheath only out of deference to the\r\nmembers of the Holy Alliance. His successor was thoroughly determined\r\nno longer to subordinate the direction of his cabinet’s policy to the\r\ninterested views of these princes and to their fears, though it is true\r\nthat the latter were well founded. The Divan, by signing the Treaty of\r\nAkerman (October 6th, 1826), had momentarily averted the storm which\r\nwas ready to burst; but still more irritating disputes had afterwards\r\narisen. The conclusion of the Treaty of London of the 6th of July,\r\n1827, in virtue of which France, England, and Russia gave existence to\r\na Christian kingdom of Greece placed under their common protection, was\r\nshortly followed by the naval battle of Navarino, fought on the 20th of\r\nOctober of the same year by the combined fleets of the three powers,\r\nagainst Ibrahim Pasha, commander-in-chief of the Egyptian forces in the\r\nMorea; and in this memorable conflict, expected by no one, but a subject\r\nof joy to some whilst judged untoward by others, the whole of the navy\r\nwhich the Porte still had at its disposal was destroyed. Very soon Mahmud\r\nII, yielding to the national desire, let it be understood that he had\r\nnever had any intention of lending himself to the execution of a treaty\r\nin virtue of which Moldavia, Wallachia, and Servia were almost as much\r\nthe czar’s vassals as his own. This was the beginning of a rupture, and\r\nNicholas answered it by a declaration of war, which appeared June 4th,\r\n1828, when his army had already crossed the Pruth.\r\n\r\nThe campaign of 1828, which accomplished nothing more than the taking of\r\nBraila and Varna, did not give a high idea of the strength of Russia;\r\nand when the emperor made up his mind to take part in it in person,\r\nhis presence wrought no change in the feebleness of the results. But\r\nit was not the same with the campaign which followed. Not only did the\r\nRussians again pass the Danube, but after having beaten the grand vizir,\r\nReschid Pasha, at Koulevtcha, on the 11th of June, Diebitsch marched\r\nthem across the Balkans for the first time, a feat which won him the\r\nname of _Sabalkanski_, and proceeded straight to Adrianople, where he\r\nwas scarcely more than two hundred kilometres (about 125 miles) from the\r\nOttoman capital. At the same time Paskevitch took Erzerum in Asia, and\r\nthe two generals would doubtless have joined hands in Constantinople but\r\nfor the efforts of diplomacy and the fear of a general conflagration.\r\nFor Russia was already too powerful; she had been allowed more than\r\nwas compatible with the policy of the system of balance, no doubt from\r\nthe fear of incurring a grave responsibility by troubling the peace\r\nof Europe. But a prospect like that of the occupation by Russia of\r\nConstantinople and the Straits silenced this fear.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [1829 A.D.]]\r\n\r\nAustria was ready to send her troops to the help of the Turks, and\r\nthe English also seemed likely to declare for the vanquished. It was\r\ntherefore necessary to come to a halt. Russia reflected that, after\r\nall, “the sultan was the least costly governor-general she could have\r\nat Constantinople,” and lent an ear to moderate conditions of peace.\r\nNevertheless, if the Treaty of Adrianople, signed September 14th, 1829,\r\ndelivered nothing to her in Europe save the mouths of the Danube, in\r\nitself a very important point, it enlarged her territories in Asia by\r\na part of the pashalik of Akhalzikh, with the fortress of that name,\r\nbesides abandoning to her those of Anapa and Pothi on the Black Sea; it\r\nconsiderably strengthened Muscovite influence in the principalities,\r\nand still further weakened Turkey, not only morally but also materially\r\nby the great pecuniary sacrifices to which she had to subscribe. That\r\npower, once so formidable, was henceforth at the mercy of her northern\r\nneighbour, the principal instrument of her decay.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE POLISH INSURRECTION (1830-1831 A.D.)\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [1830 A.D.]]\r\n\r\nBut Russia was in her turn rudely shaken by the insurrection in Poland,\r\nalways her mortal enemy after she had ceased to be her rival.[c]\r\n\r\nIt was in Moscow that the emperor Nicholas received news of the further\r\nprogress of the Belgian revolution, in consequence of which the king\r\nof the Netherlands found himself obliged to ask for the assistance of\r\nhis allies by virtue of the existing treaties. The emperor at once\r\ndespatched orders to Count Tchernishev, Field-marshal Saken, and the\r\nczarevitch to place the army on a war footing. The czarevitch was not\r\npleased at the martial turn given to the diplomatic negotiations; still\r\nmore dissatisfied was the Polish Society of that time, which sympathised\r\nwith the revolution of July; neither was the army in sympathy with the\r\napproaching campaign, which would bring it into armed collision with\r\nFrance in the name of the principles of the Holy Alliance. Although\r\ntranquillity apparently reigned in Warsaw, yet the secret societies\r\ncontinued to carry on their destructive work with success.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: COUNT DIEBITSCH-SABALKANSKI\r\n\r\n(1785-1831)]\r\n\r\nVarious ominous signs of the approaching catastrophe were not, however,\r\nwanting; but the czarevitch continued to lull himself with impossible\r\nhopes that all was peaceful and tranquil and would remain so. As to the\r\nEuropean powers allied to Russia, they did not enter into the matter with\r\nsuch decided zeal. In the present case it was the Russian autocrat alone\r\nwho was ready with entire disinterestedness to take up the defence of\r\nthe infringed lawful order. The other powers found it incomparably more\r\nexpedient to have recourse to the co-operation of diplomatic remedies;\r\nthe result was that, instead of an armed intervention, a general European\r\nconference for the settlement of the Belgian question by peaceful means\r\ntook place in London.\r\n\r\nCount Diebitsch was still in Berlin awaiting the termination of the\r\nnegotiations confided to him, when they were suddenly broken off by an\r\nevent upon which the field-marshal had not in the least calculated at\r\nthe given moment. On the 3rd of December, 1830, Diebitsch received from\r\nthe Prussian minister, Count Berastorf, news of the revolution which had\r\ntaken place in Warsaw on the 29th of November: the Polish army, forming a\r\nprepared coalition, had taken up arms against Russia. There remained but\r\none thing for Diebitsch to do and that was to hasten to St. Petersburg\r\nas quickly as possible. Meanwhile in St. Petersburg the emperor Nicholas\r\nhad received only the report of the czarevitch concerning the rising of\r\nthe troops and of inhabitants of Warsaw on the evening of the 7th of\r\nDecember, 1830.\r\n\r\nOn the next day a parade of the Preobrajenski regiment was appointed\r\nto take place, and as usual the emperor came to the riding school. At\r\nfirst everything proceeded in the usual manner; there were even no\r\ntraces of inward agitation manifest upon the handsome face with its\r\nregular, classic profile, which preserved its habitual expression of\r\nmajestic nobility. At the termination of the parade the emperor rode into\r\nthe middle of the riding school, called the officers around him, and\r\npersonally communicated to them the intelligence of the Warsaw rebellion:\r\n“I have already made arrangements that the troops designated by me\r\nshould move on Warsaw, and if necessary you too shall go, to punish the\r\ntraitors and re-establish order and the offended honour of Russia. I know\r\nthat under every circumstance I can rely upon you,” said the emperor. A\r\nunanimous outburst of indignation momentarily seized upon all present and\r\nthen enthusiastic cries resounded: “Lead us against the rebels: we will\r\nrevenge the offended honour of Russia.” They kissed the emperor’s hands\r\nand feet and the hem of his garment with shouts and cheers. The outburst\r\nof indignation was so violent that Nicholas considered it necessary to\r\nmoderate it, and with the majesty that was natural to him he reminded\r\nthe officers surrounding him that not all the Poles had broken their\r\noath; that the ringleaders of the insurrection must be punished, but that\r\nvengeance must not be taken on the people: that the repentant must be\r\npardoned and hatred not allowed.\r\n\r\nFrom the subsequent reports of the grand duke the emperor learned that\r\nthe czarevitch had permitted the portion of the Polish army that remained\r\nwith him to return to Warsaw; in exchange for this the deputies who came\r\nto the czarevitch promised him and the Russian detachment a free passage\r\nto the frontiers of the empire. It was decided that a sufficient number\r\nof troops should be concentrated in the Polish frontier to allow of\r\ndecisive measures being taken against the insurgents. Count Diebitsch was\r\nappointed commander-in-chief of the acting army, whilst the office of\r\nchief of the staff was filled by Count Tolle.\r\n\r\nWhen the czarevitch reached the Russian frontier he wrote as follows to\r\nthe emperor Nicholas: “And now the work of sixteen years is completely\r\ndestroyed by a set of ensign-bearers, young officers, and students. I\r\nwill not further enlarge on the matter, but duty commands me to bear\r\nwitness to you that the landed proprietors, the rural population, and in\r\ngeneral all holders of property of any kind are up in despair over this.\r\nThe officers and generals as well as the soldiers are unable to keep from\r\njoining the general movement, being carried away by the young people\r\nand ensign-bearers who led everyone astray. In a word, the position of\r\naffairs is extremely bad, and I really do not know what will come of it.\r\nAll my measures of surveillance have led to nothing, in spite of the fact\r\nthat everything was beginning to be discovered. Here are we Russians at\r\nthe frontier, but great God in what a condition!--almost barefoot, for we\r\nall came out as if at the sound of an alarm, in the hopes of returning\r\nto barracks, whilst instead awful marches have had to be made. The\r\nofficers have been deprived of everything and have almost nothing with\r\nwhich to clothe themselves. I am broken hearted; at the age of fifty-one\r\nand a half years I never thought to finish my career in this lamentable\r\nmanner after thirty-five and a half years of service. I pray to God that\r\nthe army to which I have devoted sixteen years of my life may be brought\r\nto reason, and return to the path of duty and honour, acknowledging its\r\nprevious errors, before coercive measures have to be taken. But this is\r\ntoo much to expect from the age in which we live, and I greatly doubt the\r\nrealisation of my desires.”\r\n\r\nAny agreement with Poland became daily more impossible and both sides\r\nprepared for war. On the 17th of December the emperor Nicholas’\r\nproclamation to the Polish army and nation was issued, and on the 24th\r\na manifesto was published offering means of reconciliation to all those\r\nwho returned to their duty. Meanwhile General Chlopicki was installed\r\nas dictator in Warsaw, but he was unable to save Poland from a rupture\r\nwith Russia. Two deputies were sent to St. Petersburg to enter into\r\nnegotiations with the emperor Nicholas; they were the minister of\r\nfinance, Prince Lubetzki and a member of the diet, Count Ezerski. But\r\nneither could these negotiations avert the bloody events of the year\r\n1831. “It is hard to foresee the future,” wrote the emperor to the\r\nczarevitch; “but weighing the relative probabilities of success, it is\r\ndifficult to suppose that the new year will show itself more distressing\r\nfor us than the year 1830; God grant that I may not be mistaken.\r\nI should like to see you peacefully settled in your Belvedere and\r\norder re-established throughout; but how much there yet remains to be\r\naccomplished before we are in a condition to attain to this! Which of the\r\ntwo must perish--for it appears inevitable that one must perish, Russia\r\nor Poland? Decide for yourself. I have exhausted all possible means in\r\norder to avert such a calamity--all means compatible with honour and my\r\nconscience--but they are exhausted. What remains for me to do?”\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [1831 A.D.]]\r\n\r\nSoon the diet assembled in Warsaw took a decision which completed the\r\nrupture between Poland and Russia. On the 25th of January, 1831, the diet\r\ndeclared the Romanov dynasty to be deprived of the throne of Poland. The\r\nPoles themselves thus unbound the hands of the emperor, and the duel\r\nbetween Russia and Poland became inevitable. The emperor replied to the\r\nchallenge by a manifesto in accordance with which the Russian troops\r\ncrossed the Polish frontier, and on the 25th of February a decisive\r\nbattle took place before Prague at Grokhov, by which the Polish army was\r\nobliged to retreat to Warsaw with a loss of twelve thousand men.\r\n\r\nBut Count Diebitsch did not recognise the possibility of taking advantage\r\nof the victory gained, and which would have been inevitably completed by\r\nthe occupation of the Polish capital; and Sabalkanski was not fated to\r\nbecome prince of Warsaw. The Polish troops retreated unhindered across\r\nthe only bridge to Warsaw; the new Polish commander-in-chief Skrjinetzski\r\nset out to reorganise the army, the rising spread even to the Russian\r\ngovernments, and the campaign, against all expectations, dragged on for\r\nsix months. Meanwhile it was a war upon which depended, according to the\r\nexpression used by the emperor, “the political existence of Russia.”\r\n\r\nOn the 26th of May Diebitsch gained a second victory over the Polish\r\narmy, which also terminated by the favourable retreat of the latter;\r\nand on the 13th of June, the emperor found occasion to write to his\r\nfield-marshal: “Act at length so that I can understand you.” The letter\r\nwas however not read by Count Diebitsch, for on the 10th of June the\r\nfield-marshal suddenly died of cholera in the village of Kleshov near\r\nPultiusk. He was replaced by Field-marshal Count Paskevitch-Erivanski,\r\nwho was as early as April, 1831, called by the emperor from Tiflis to St.\r\nPetersburg. It was decided to cross the lower Vis-Suta and move towards\r\nWarsaw. The czarevitch Constantine outlived Count Diebitsch only by a few\r\ndays. He also died suddenly of cholera at Vitebsk, in the night between\r\nthe 26th and 27th of June of the year 1831.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIELD-MARSHAL PASKEVITCH\r\n\r\n(1782-1856)]\r\n\r\nThe Polish insurrection from that time daily grew nearer to its\r\ndefinitive conclusion; it was determined by the two days’ storming\r\nof Warsaw, which took place on the 7th and 8th of September. Finally\r\nField-marshal Paskevitch was able to communicate to the emperor the news\r\nthat “Warsaw is at the feet of your imperial majesty.” Prince Suvorov,\r\naide-de-camp of the emperor, was the bearer of this intelligence to\r\nTsarskoi Selo on the 16th of September.\r\n\r\nNicholas wrote as follows to his victorious field-marshal: “With the help\r\nof the all-merciful God, you have again raised the splendour and glory\r\nof our arms, you have punished the disloyal traitors, you have avenged\r\nRussia, you have subdued Warsaw--from henceforth you are the most serene\r\nprince of Warsaw. Let posterity remember that the honour and glory of the\r\nRussian army are inseparable from your name, and may your name preserve\r\nfor everyone the memory of the day on which the name of Russia was again\r\nmade glorious. This is the sincere expression of the grateful heart of\r\nyour sovereign, your friend, and your old subordinate.”\r\n\r\nAfter the fall of Warsaw the war still continued for a while, but not\r\nfor long. The chief forces of the Polish army, which had retired to\r\nNovogeorgievsk, finished by passing into Prussian territory at the end of\r\nSeptember, and on the 21st of October the last fortress surrendered. The\r\nPolish insurrection was at an end. But the peace, attained by such heavy\r\nsacrifice, was accompanied by a new evil for Russia; in Europe appeared\r\nthe Polish emigration, carrying with it hatred and vociferations against\r\nRussia and preparing the inimical conditions of public opinion in the\r\nwest against the Russian government.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE OUTBREAK OF CHOLERA AND THE RIOTS OCCASIONED BY IT (1830 A.D.)\r\n\r\nThe emperor had hardly returned to St. Petersburg from opening the\r\ndiet in Warsaw, when suddenly a new care occupied the attention of the\r\ngovernment. The cholera made its appearance in the empire. This terrible\r\nillness, until then known to Russia only by name and by narratives\r\ndescribing its devastations, brought with it still greater fear, because\r\nno one knew or could indicate either medical or police measures to\r\nbe taken against it. General opinion inclined, however, towards the\r\nadvantages to be derived from quarantine and isolation, such as had\r\nbeen employed against the plague, and the government immediately took\r\nnecessary measures in this direction with the activity that the emperor’s\r\nstrong will managed to instil into all his dispositions. Troops were\r\nwithout delay stationed at various points and cordons formed from them\r\nand the local inhabitants, in order to save the governments in the\r\ninterior and the two capitals from the calamity.\r\n\r\nIn spite of all precautions, however, a fresh source of grief was added\r\nto all the cares and anxieties that pressed upon the emperor at that\r\nperiod. Since the 26th of June the cholera had appeared in St. Petersburg\r\nand in a few days had attained menacing dimensions. This awful illness\r\nthrew all classes of the population into a state of the greatest terror,\r\nparticularly the common people by whom all the measures taken for the\r\npreservation of the public health--such as increased police surveillance,\r\nthe surrounding of the towns with troops, and even the removal of\r\nthose stricken with cholera to hospitals--were at first regarded as\r\npersecutions. Mobs began to assemble, strangers were stopped in the\r\nstreets and searched for the poison they were supposed to carry on them,\r\nwhile doctors were publicly accused of poisoning the people. Finally, on\r\nthe 4th of July, the mob, excited by rumours and suspicions, gathered\r\ntogether at the Hay Market and attacked the house in which a temporary\r\ncholera hospital had been established. They broke the windows, threw the\r\nfurniture out into the street, wounded and cast out the sick, thrashed\r\nthe hospital servants, and killed several of the doctors. The police were\r\npowerless to restore order and even the final appearance of the military\r\ngovernor-general Count Essen did not attain the necessary result. A\r\nbattalion of the Semenov regiment forced the people to disperse from the\r\nsquare into the side streets, but was far from putting a stop to the\r\ndisturbance.\r\n\r\nThe next day the emperor Nicholas went on a steamer from St. Petersburg\r\nto Elagium Island. When he had heard the reports of various persons as to\r\nthe state of the town he got into a carriage with Adjutant-general Prince\r\nMenshikov and drove to the Preobrajenski parade-ground in the town, where\r\na battalion of the Preobrajenski regiment was encamped. When he had\r\nthanked the troops, the emperor continued his way along the carriage road\r\nwhere he threatened with his displeasure some crowds and shopkeepers;\r\nfrom there he drove to the Hay Market where about five thousand people\r\nhad assembled. Standing up in his carriage and turning to the mob, the\r\nemperor spoke as follows: “Misdeeds were committed yesterday, public\r\norder was disturbed; shame on the Russian people for forgetting the\r\nfaith of their fathers and imitating the turbulence of the French and\r\nPoles! They have taught you this: seize them and take those suspected to\r\nthe authorities; but wickedness has been committed here, here we have\r\noffended and angered God--let us turn to the church, down on your knees,\r\nand beg the forgiveness of the Almighty!”\r\n\r\nThe people fell on their knees and crossed themselves in contrition; the\r\nemperor prostrated himself also, and exclamations of “We have sinned,\r\naccursed ones that we are!” resounded throughout the air. Continuing his\r\nspeech to the people, the emperor again admonished the crowd: “I have\r\nsworn before God to preserve the prosperity of the people entrusted to\r\nme by providence; I am answerable before God for these disorders: and\r\ntherefore I will not allow them. Woe be to the disobedient!”\r\n\r\nAt this moment some men in the crowd raised their voices. The emperor\r\nthen replied: “What do you want--whom do you want? Is it I? I am not\r\nafraid of anything--here I am!” and with these words he pointed to his\r\nbreast. Cries of enthusiasm ensued. After this the emperor, probably as\r\na sign of reconciliation, embraced an old man in the crowd and returned,\r\nfirst to Elagium and afterwards to Peterhov. The day afterwards the\r\nemperor again visited the capital. Order was re-established, but the\r\ncholera continued to rage. Six hundred persons died daily, and it was\r\nonly from the middle of July that the mortality began to diminish.\r\n\r\nFar more dangerous in its consequences was the revolt that arose in\r\nthe Novgorod military settlements. Here the cholera and rumours of\r\npoisoning only served as a pretext for rebellion; the seed of general\r\ndissatisfaction among the population belonging to this creation of Count\r\nAraktcheiev continued to exist in spite of all the changes introduced by\r\nthe emperor Nicholas into the administration of the military settlements.\r\nA spark was sufficient to produce in the settlements an explosion of\r\nhitherto unprecedented fury, and the cholera served as the spark. Order\r\nwas however finally re-established in the settlements and then the\r\nemperor Nicholas set off for them quite alone and presented himself\r\nbefore the assembled battalions, which had stained themselves with the\r\nblood of their officers and stood awaiting, trembling and in silence the\r\njudgment of their sovereign.[b]\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE WAR IN THE CAUCASUS (1829-1840 A.D.)\r\n\r\nThe possession of the Caucasus is a question vitally affecting the\r\ninterests of Russia in her provinces beyond that range of mountains,\r\nand her ulterior projects with regard to the regions of Persia and\r\nCentral Asia. Here are the terms in which this subject is handled in a\r\nreport printed at St. Petersburg, and addressed to the emperor after the\r\nexpedition of General Emmanuel to Elbruz in 1829:\r\n\r\n“The Circassians (Tsherkessians) bar out Russia from the south, and may\r\nat their pleasure open or close the passage to the nations of Asia.\r\nAt present their intestine dissensions, fostered by Russia, hinder\r\nthem from uniting under one leader; but it must not be forgotten that,\r\naccording to traditions religiously preserved amongst them, the sway of\r\ntheir ancestors extended as far as to the Black Sea. They believe that\r\na mighty people, descended from their ancestors, and whose existence\r\nis verified by the ruins of Madjar, has once already overrun the fine\r\nplains adjacent to the Danube, and finally settled in Panonia. Add to\r\nthis consideration their superiority in arms. Perfect horsemen, extremely\r\nwell armed, inured to war by the continual freebooting they exercise\r\nagainst their neighbours, courageous, and disdaining the advantages of\r\nour civilisation, the imagination is appalled at the consequences which\r\ntheir union under one leader might have for Russia, which has no other\r\nbulwark against their ravages than a military line, too extensive to be\r\nvery strong.”\r\n\r\nFor the better understanding of the war which Russia has been so long\r\nwaging with the mountaineers, let us glance at the topography of the\r\nCaucasus, and the respective positions of the belligerents.\r\n\r\nThe chain of the Caucasus exhibits a peculiar conformation, altogether\r\ndifferent from that of any of the European chains. The Alps, the\r\nPyrenees, and the Carpathians are accessible only by the valleys, and\r\nin these the inhabitants of the country find their subsistence, and\r\nagriculture developes its wealth. The contrary is the case in the\r\nCaucasus. From the fortress of Anapa on the Black Sea, all along to the\r\nCaspian, the northern slope presents only immense inclined plains, rising\r\nin terraces to a height of 3,000 or 4,000 yards above the sea level.\r\nThese plains, rent on all directions by deep and narrow valleys and\r\nvertical clefts, often form real steppes, and possess on their loftiest\r\nheights rich pastures, where the inhabitants, secure from all attack,\r\nfind fresh grass for their cattle in the sultriest days of summer. The\r\nvalleys on the other hand are frightful abysses, the steep sides of which\r\nare clothed with brambles, while the bottoms are filled with rapid\r\ntorrents foaming over beds of rocks and stones. Such is the singular\r\nspectacle generally presented by the northern slope of the Caucasus. This\r\nbrief description may give an idea of the difficulties to be encountered\r\nby an invading army. Obliged to occupy the heights, it is incessantly\r\nchecked in its march by impassable ravines, which do not allow of the\r\nemployment of cavalry, and for the most part prevent the passage of\r\nartillery. The ordinary tactics of the mountaineers is to fall back\r\nbefore the enemy, until the nature of the ground or the want of supplies\r\nobliges the latter to begin a retrograde movement. Then it is that they\r\nattack the invaders, and, intrenched in their forests behind impregnable\r\nrocks, they inflict the most terrible carnage on them with little danger\r\nto themselves.\r\n\r\nOn the south the character of the Caucasian chain is different. From\r\nAnapa to Gagri, along the shores of the Black Sea, we observe a secondary\r\nchain composed of schistous mountains, seldom exceeding 1000 yards in\r\nheight. But the nature of their soil, and of their rocks, would be enough\r\nto render them almost impracticable for European armies, even were they\r\nnot covered with impenetrable forests. The inhabitants of this region,\r\nwho are called Circassians, are entirely independent, and constitute one\r\nof the most warlike peoples of the Caucasus.\r\n\r\nThe great chain begins in reality at Gagri, but the mountains recede from\r\nthe shore, and nothing is to be seen along the coast as far as Mingrelia\r\nbut secondary hills, commanded by immense crags, that completely cut off\r\nall approach to the central part of the Caucasus. This region, so feebly\r\ndefended by its topographical conformation, is Abkhasia, the inhabitants\r\nof which have been forced to submit to Russia. To the north and on the\r\nnorthern slope, westward of the military road from Mozdok to Tiflis,\r\ndwell a considerable number of tribes, some of them ruled by a sort of\r\nfeudal system, others constituted into little republics. Those of the\r\nwest, dependent on Circassia and Abadja, are in continual war with the\r\nempire, whilst the Nogaians, who inhabit the plains on the left bank of\r\nthe Kuma, and the tribes of the great Kabarda, own the sovereignty of\r\nthe czar; but their wavering and dubious submission cannot be relied\r\non. In the centre, at the foot of the Elbruz, dwell the Suanetians, an\r\nunsubdued people, and near them, occupying both sides of the pass of\r\nDariel, are the Ingutches and Ossetans, exceptional tribes, essentially\r\ndifferent from the aboriginal peoples. Finally we have, eastward of the\r\ngreat Tiflis road, near the Terek, little Kabarda, and the country of the\r\nKumicks, for the present subjugated; and then those indomitable tribes,\r\nthe Lesghians and Tchetchens, of whom Schamyl is the Ab del Kadir, and\r\nwho extended over the two slopes of the Caucasus to the vicinity of the\r\nCaspian.\r\n\r\nIn reality, the Kuban and the Terek, that rise from the central chain,\r\nand fall, the one into the Black Sea, the other into the Caspian, may\r\nbe considered as the northern political limits of independent Caucasus.\r\nIt is along those two rivers that Russia has formed her armed line,\r\ndefended by Cossacks, and detachments from the regular army. The Russians\r\nhave, indeed, penetrated those northern frontiers at sundry points,\r\nand have planted some forts within the country of the Lesghians and\r\nTchetchens. But those lonely posts, in which a few unhappy garrisons\r\nare surrounded on all sides, and generally without a chance of escape,\r\ncannot be regarded as a real occupation of the soil on which they stand.\r\nThey are, in fact, only so many pickets, whose business is only to watch\r\nmore closely the movements of the mountaineers. In the south, from Anapa\r\nto Gagri, along the Black Sea, the imperial possessions never extended\r\nbeyond a few detached forts, completely isolated, and deprived of all\r\nmeans of communication by land. A rigorous blockade was established on\r\nthis coast; but the Circassians, as intrepid in their frail barks as\r\namong their mountains, often passed by night through the Russian line\r\nof vessels, and reached Trebizond and Constantinople. Elsewhere, from\r\nMingrelia to the Caspian, the frontiers are less precisely defined, and\r\ngenerally run parallel with the great chain of the Caucasus.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [1835 A.D.]]\r\n\r\nThus limited, the Caucasus, including the territory occupied by the\r\nsubject tribes, presents a surface of scarcely 5000 leagues; and it is in\r\nthis narrow region that a virgin and chivalric nation, amounting at most\r\nto 2,000,000 of souls, proudly upholds its independence against the might\r\nof the Russian empire, and has for upwards of twenty years sustained one\r\nof the most obstinate struggles known to modern history.\r\n\r\nThe Russian line of the Kuban, which is exactly similar to that of the\r\nTerek, is defended by the Cossacks of the Black Sea, the poor remains\r\nof the famous Zaparogians, whom Catherine II subdued with so much\r\ndifficulty, and whom she colonised at the foot of the Caucasus, as a\r\nbulwark against the incursions of the mountaineers. The line consists\r\nof small forts and watch stations; the latter are merely a kind of\r\nsentry-box raised on four posts, about fifty feet from the ground. Two\r\nCossacks keep watch in them day and night. On the least movement of the\r\nenemy in the vast plain of reeds that fringe both banks of the river, a\r\nbeacon fire is kindled on the top of the watch box. If the danger becomes\r\nmore pressing, an enormous torch of straw and tar is set fire to. The\r\nsignal is repeated from post to post, the whole line springs to arms, and\r\n500 or 600 men are instantly assembled on the point threatened. These\r\nposts, composed generally of a dozen men, are very close to each other,\r\nparticularly in the most dangerous places. Small forts have been erected\r\nat intervals with earthworks, and a few pieces of cannon; they contain\r\neach from 150 to 200 men.\r\n\r\nBut notwithstanding all the vigilance of the Cossacks, often aided by the\r\ntroops of the line, the mountaineers not unfrequently cross the frontier\r\nand carry their incursions, which are always marked with massacre and\r\npillage, into the adjacent provinces. There are bloody but justifiable\r\nreprisals. In 1835 a body of fifty horsemen entered the country of the\r\nCossacks, and proceeded to a distance of 120 leagues, to plunder the\r\nGerman colony of Madjar and the important village of Vladimirovka, on\r\nthe Kuma, and what is most remarkable they got back to their mountains\r\nwithout being interrupted. The same year Kisliar, on the Caspian, was\r\nsacked by the Lesghians. These daring expeditions prove of themselves how\r\ninsufficient is the armed line of the Caucasus, and to what dangers that\r\npart of southern Russia is exposed.\r\n\r\nThe line of forts until lately existing along the Black Sea was quite as\r\nweak, and the Circassians there were quite as daring. They used to carry\r\noff the Russian soldiers from beneath the fire of their redoubts, and\r\ncome up to the very foot of their walls to insult the garrison. Hommaire\r\nde Hell relates that, at the time he was exploring the mouths of the\r\nKuban, a hostile chief had the audacity to appear one day before the\r\ngates of Anapa. He did all he could to irritate the Russians, and abusing\r\nthem as cowards and woman-hearted, he defied them to single combat.\r\nExasperated by his invectives, the commandant ordered that he should be\r\nfired on with grape. The horse of the mountaineer reared and threw off\r\nhis rider, who, without letting go the bridle, instantly mounted again,\r\nand, advancing still nearer to the walls, discharged his pistol almost at\r\npoint-blank distance at the soldiers, and galloped off to the mountains.\r\n\r\nAs for the blockade by sea, the imperial squadron has not been expert\r\nenough to render it really effectual. It was only a few armed boats,\r\nmanned by Cossacks, that gave the Circassians any serious uneasiness.\r\nThese Cossacks like those of the Black Sea, are descended from the\r\nZaparogians. Previously to the last war with Turkey they were settled\r\non the right bank of the Danube, where their ancestors had taken refuge\r\nafter the destruction of their Setcha. During the campaigns of 1828-29,\r\npains were taken to revive their national feelings, they were brought\r\nagain by fair means or by force under the imperial sway, and were then\r\nsettled in the forts along the Caucasian shore, the keeping of which was\r\ncommitted to their charge. Courageous, enterprising, and worthy rivals\r\nof their foes, they waged a most active war against the skiffs of the\r\nmountaineers in their boats, which carry crews of fifty or sixty men.\r\n\r\nThe treaty of Adrianople was in a manner the opening of a new era in\r\nthe relations of Russia with the mountaineers; for it was by virtue of\r\nthat treaty that the czar, already master of Anapa and Sudjuk Kaleh,\r\npretended to the sovereignty of Circassia and of the whole seaboard of\r\nthe Black Sea. True to the invariable principles of its foreign policy,\r\nthe government at first employed means of corruption, and strove to\r\nseduce the various chiefs of the country by pensions, decorations, and\r\nmilitary appointments. But the mountaineers, who had the example of the\r\nPersian provinces before their eyes, sternly rejected all the overtures\r\nof Russia, and repudiated the clauses of the convention of Adrianople;\r\nthe political and commercial independence of their country became their\r\nrallying cry, and they would not treat on any other condition. All\r\nsuch ideas were totally at variance with Nicholas’ schemes of absolute\r\ndominion; therefore he had recourse to arms to obtain by force what he\r\nhad been unable to accomplish by other means.\r\n\r\nAbkhasia, situated on the eastern coast of the Black Sea, and easily\r\naccessible, was the first invaded. A Russian force occupied the country\r\nin 1839, under the ordinary pretence of supporting one of its princes,\r\nand putting an end to anarchy. In the same year General Paskevitch,\r\nthen governor-general of the Caucasus, for the first time made an armed\r\nexploration of the country of the Circassians beyond the Kuban; but he\r\neffected absolutely nothing, and his expedition only resulted in great\r\nloss of men and stores. In the following year war broke out in Daghestan\r\nwith the Lesghians and the Tchetchens. The celebrated Kadi Mulah, giving\r\nhimself out for a prophet, gathered together a considerable number of\r\npartisans; but unfortunately for him there was no unanimity among the\r\ntribes, and the princes were continually counteracting each other. Kadi\r\nMulah never was able to bring more than 3,000 or 4,000 men together;\r\nnevertheless, he maintained the struggle with a courage worthy of a\r\nbetter fate, and Russia knows what it cost her to put down the revolt\r\nof Daghestan. As for any real progress in that part of the Caucasus,\r\nthe Russians made none; they did no more than replace things on the old\r\nfooting. Daghestan soon became again more hostile than ever, and the\r\nTchetchens and Lesghians continued in separate detachments to plunder\r\nand ravage the adjacent provinces up to the time when the ascendancy of\r\nthe celebrated Schamyl, the worthy successor of Kadi Mulah, gave a fresh\r\nimpulse to the warlike tribes of the mountain, and rendered them more\r\nformidable than ever.\r\n\r\nAfter taking possession of Anapa and Sudjuk Kaleh, the Russians thought\r\nof seizing the whole seaboard of Circassia, and especially the various\r\npoints suitable for the establishment of military posts. They made\r\nthemselves masters of Guelendchik and the important position of Gagri,\r\nwhich commands the pass between Circassia and Abkhasia. The Circassians\r\nheroically defended their territory; but how could they have withstood\r\nthe guns of the ships of war that mowed them down whilst the soldiers\r\nwere landing and constructing their redoubts? The blockade of the coasts\r\nwas declared in 1838, and all foreign communication with the Caucasus\r\nostensibly intercepted. During the four following years Russia suffered\r\nheavy losses; and all her successes were limited to the establishment of\r\nsome small isolated forts on the sea-coast. She then increased her army,\r\nlaid down the military road from the Kuban to Guelendchik, across the\r\nlast western offshoot of the Caucasus, set on foot an exploration of the\r\nenemy’s whole coast, and prepared to push the war with renewed vigour.\r\n\r\nIn 1837 the emperor Nicholas visited the Caucasus. He would see for\r\nhimself the theatre of a war so disastrous to his arms, and try what\r\nimpression his imperial presence could make on the mountaineers. The\r\nchiefs of the country were invited to various conferences, to which\r\nthey boldly repaired on the faith of the Russian parole; but instead\r\nof conciliating them by words of peace and moderation, the emperor\r\nonly exasperated them by his threatening and haughty language. “Do you\r\nknow,” said he to them, “that I have powder enough to blow up all your\r\nmountains?”\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [1839 A.D.]]\r\n\r\nDuring the three following years there was an incessant succession\r\nof expeditions. Golovin, on the frontiers of Georgia, Grabe on the\r\nnorth, and Racivski on the Circassian seaboard, left nothing untried to\r\naccomplish their master’s orders. The sacrifices incurred by Russia were\r\nenormous; the greater part of her fleet was destroyed by a storm, but all\r\nefforts failed against the intrepidity and tactics of the mountaineers.\r\nSome new forts erected under cover of the ships, were all that resulted\r\nfrom these disastrous campaigns. “I was in the Caucasus in 1839,” says\r\nHommaire de Hell, “when Grabe returned from his famous expedition against\r\nShamyl. When the army marched it had numbered 6000 men, 1,000 of whom,\r\nand 120 officers, were cut off in three months. But as the general had\r\nadvanced further into the country than any of his predecessors, Russia\r\nsang pæans, and Grabe became the hero of the day, although the imperial\r\ntroops had been forced to retreat and entirely evacuate the country\r\nthey had invaded. All the other expeditions were similar to this one,\r\nand achieved in reality nothing but the burning and destruction of a\r\nfew villages. It is true the mountaineers are far from being victorious\r\nin all their encounters with the Russians, whose artillery they cannot\r\neasily withstand; but if they are obliged to give way to numbers, or to\r\nengineering, nevertheless they remain in the end masters of the ground,\r\nand annul all the momentary advantages gained by their enemies.”\r\n\r\nThe year 1840 was still more fatal to the arms of Nicholas. Almost all\r\nthe new forts on the seaboard were taken by the Circassians, who bravely\r\nattacked and carried the best fortified posts without artillery. The\r\nmilitary road from the Kuban to Guelendchik was intercepted, Fort St.\r\nNicholas, which commanded it, was stormed and the garrison massacred.\r\nNever yet had Russia endured such heavy blows. The disasters were such\r\nthat the official journals themselves, after many months’ silence,\r\nwere at last obliged to speak of them; but the most serious losses,\r\nthe destruction of the new road from the Kuban, the taking of Fort St.\r\nNicholas, and that of several other forts, were entirely forgotten in the\r\nofficial statement.\r\n\r\nOn the eastern side of the mountain the war was fully as disastrous\r\nfor the invaders. The imperial army lost four hundred petty officers\r\nand soldiers, and twenty-nine officers in the battle of Valrik against\r\nthe Tchetchens. The military colonies of the Terek were attacked and\r\nplundered, and when General Golovin retired to his winter quarters at the\r\nend of the campaign, he had lost more than three-fourths of his men.\r\n\r\nThe great Kabarda did not remain an indifferent spectator of the\r\noffensive league formed by the tribes of the Caucasus; and when Russia,\r\nsuspecting with reason the unfriendly disposition of some tribes, made\r\nan armed exploration on the banks of the Laba in order to construct\r\nredoubts, and thus cut off the subjugated tribes from the others, the\r\ngeneral found the country, wherever he advanced, but a desert. All the\r\ninhabitants had already retired to the other side of the Laba to join\r\ntheir warlike neighbours.[d]\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE EMPEROR’S CONSERVATIVE PATRIOTISM\r\n\r\nHowever, in spite of all these disastrous campaigns, Nicholas had not\r\nlost sight of his most important task--that of consolidating internal\r\norder by reforms. His attention had been directed above all to the\r\nadministration, from the heart of which he had sought especially to\r\nexterminate corruption with a severity and courage proportioned to the\r\nimmensity of the evil. Then he had announced his firm desire to perfect\r\nthe laws, and had charged Count Speranski to work at them under his\r\npersonal direction. The digest (_svod_) promulgated in 1833 was the\r\nfirst fruit of these efforts and was followed by various special codes.\r\nFinally, turning his attention to public instruction, he had assigned to\r\nit as a basis the national traditions and religion and charged Uvarov,\r\npresident of the Imperial Academy of Sciences, a man of learning and\r\ntalent, to animate it with this spirit, so hostile to the ideas of the\r\nwest, but--let us say it at once--better suited to the real needs of the\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nNicholas, allowing himself to be ruled by this spirit, plunged further\r\nand further into a system which, though contrary to that of Peter the\r\nGreat, we do not pretend absolutely to condemn on that account, and which\r\nthe marquis de Custine[e] has highly extolled in his celebrated book,\r\n_La Russie en 1839_. “The emperor Nicholas,” he said, “thought that the\r\nday of mere seeming was past for Russia, and that the whole structure of\r\ncivilisation was to remake in that country. He has relaid the foundations\r\nof society. Peter, called the Great, would have overturned it a second\r\ntime in order to rebuild it: Nicholas is more skilful. I am struck\r\nwith admiration for this man who is secretly struggling, with all the\r\nstrength of his will, against the work of Peter the Great’s genius. He\r\nis restoring individuality to a nation which has strayed for more than a\r\ncentury in the paths of imitation.”\r\n\r\nWithout ceasing to borrow diligently from Europe her inventions and arts,\r\nher progress in industry, in administration, in the conduct of land and\r\nsea armies--in a word, all the material improvements which she devises\r\nand realises, he endeavoured to close Russia to her ideas on philosophy,\r\npolitics, and religion. He condemned exotic tendencies as pernicious\r\nto his states, and, without depriving himself of the services of the\r\nGermans, the principal depositaries of superior enlightenment in that\r\ncountry, as yet only imperfectly moulded to civilisation, he relied by\r\npreference on the party of the old Russians, which included the clergy,\r\nwhom he treated with respect in spite of the inferiority of their\r\nposition. Nationality, autocracy, orthodoxy--these three words, taken as\r\nthe national watchword, sum up the ideas to which he subordinated his\r\ninternal policy. The expression, _Holy Russia_, which has been the object\r\nof such profound astonishment to the Latin world, reflects also this\r\nspirit.\r\n\r\nHe surrounded with great solemnity those acts which he performed in\r\nhis quality of head of the church in his own country, and posed as the\r\nprotector of all his co-religionists in Moldavia, Wallachia, Servia,\r\nMontenegro, and other countries. Like his ancestors of preceding\r\ndynasties, he adorned himself on solemn occasions with a gold cross which\r\nhe wore diagonally on his breast. This bias was summed up in the new\r\nword _cæsaropapism_. He regarded with special enthusiasm that one act\r\non account of which, the accusation of religious intolerance was fixed\r\nupon him--an accusation justified by many of his deeds. In consequence of\r\nthe decisions of the council of Florence, and up till 1839, there were\r\nin Russia 1,500,000 United Greeks, subjected to the papal obedience.\r\nAt their head was the archbishop, sometimes the metropolitan, of White\r\nRussia, and the bishop, or archbishop, of Lithuania. In 1839 these two\r\nprelates, having met in conjunction with a third, at Polotsk, the seat\r\nof the first of these eparchies, had signed a document in which they\r\nexpressed the wish to unite, they and their church, with the national\r\nand primitive church, and prayed the emperor to sanction this union.\r\nNicholas referred the matter to the holy synod, and, the latter having\r\nwith great eagerness signified its approval of the act, he sanctioned\r\nit in his turn, adding these words beneath his signature: “I thank God\r\nand I authorize it.” It is well known to what complaints on the part of\r\nthe pope this suppression of the uniate Greek church soon afterward gave\r\nrise.[c]\r\n\r\n\r\nUNVEILING OF THE MONUMENT AT BORODINO\r\n\r\nThe emperor Nicholas was fond of great gatherings of the troops, and an\r\noccasion for such was afforded in 1839 by the unveiling of the monument\r\nerected on the battle-field of Borodino. The thought of this muster of\r\nthe troops had already occupied the emperor’s mind since 1838, but at\r\nthat time he had in view not merely the participation of the troops in\r\nmanœuvres and exercises, but the immortalisation of the tradition of the\r\nvalorous exploits of the Russian army in the defence of the fatherland\r\nagainst the invasion of Napoleon. On the day of the unveiling of the\r\nBorodino monument, August 26th, 120,000 men were gathered around it.\r\nThe emperor invited to take part in the solemnities all the surviving\r\ncomrades of Kutuzov and many foreign guests.\r\n\r\nOn the anniversary of the battle of Borodino a great review of all the\r\ntroops assembled on this historic spot took place. In the morning, before\r\nthe review began, the following order of his imperial majesty, written by\r\nthe emperor’s hand, was read to the troops:\r\n\r\n“Children. Before you stands the monument which bears witness to the\r\nglorious deeds of your comrades. Here, on this same spot, 27 years ago,\r\nthe arrogant enemy dreamed of conquering the Russian army which fought\r\nin defence of the faith, the czar and the fatherland. God punished the\r\nfoolish: the bones of the insolent invaders were scattered from Moscow\r\nto the Niemen--and we entered Paris. The time has now come to render\r\nglory to a great exploit. And thus, may the eternal memory of the emperor\r\nAlexander I be immortal to us: for by his firm will Russia was saved; may\r\nthe glory of your comrades who fell as heroes be also everlasting, and\r\nmay their exploits serve as an example to us and our further posterity.\r\nYou will ever be the hope and support of your sovereign and our common\r\nmother Russia.”\r\n\r\nThis order aroused the greatest enthusiasm amongst the troops, but it was\r\nhighly displeasing to the foreigners; it appeared to them strange and\r\nalmost offensive, they considered that “in reality it was nothing but\r\nhigh sounding phrases.”\r\n\r\nThree days later the emperor Nicholas had the battle of Borodino\r\nreproduced. After the unveiling of the Borodino monument the laying of\r\nthe first stone of the cathedral of Christ the Saviour took place in\r\nMoscow. This solemnity brought to a close the commemoration of the year\r\n1812 which had delivered Russia from a foreign invasion and was the dawn\r\nof the liberation of Europe.\r\n\r\nThe year 1839 was remarkable for yet another important event: the reunion\r\nof the Uniates.[68]\r\n\r\n\r\nDEATH OR RETIREMENT OF THE OLD MINISTERS\r\n\r\nLittle by little the workers in the political arena of Alexander’s reign\r\nhad disappeared. Count V. P. Kotchulzi, who had been president of the\r\nsenate since 1827 and afterwards chancellor of the interior, died in 1834\r\nand had been replaced by N. N. Novseltsev as president of the senate.\r\nAfter his death the emperor Nicholas appointed to that office Count I. V.\r\nVasiltchikov, who remained at his post until his death, which took place\r\nin 1847.\r\n\r\nThe emperor was above all grieved at the death of Speranski in the\r\nyear 1837. He recognised this loss as irreparable, and in speaking of\r\nhim said: “Not everyone understood Speranski or knew how to value him\r\nsufficiently; at first I myself was in this respect perhaps more in\r\nfault than anyone. I was told much of his liberal ideas; calumny even\r\ntouched him in reference to the history of December 26th. But afterwards\r\nall these accusations were scattered like dust, and I found in him the\r\nmost faithful, devoted and zealous servant, with vast knowledge and vast\r\nexperience. Everyone now knows how great are my obligations and those\r\nof Russia to him--and the calumniators are silenced. The only reproach\r\nI could make him was his feeling against my late brother; but that too\r\nis over”.... The emperor stopped without finishing his thought, which\r\nprobably contained a secret, involuntary justification of Speranski.\r\n\r\nIn 1844 died another statesman who was still nearer and dearer to the\r\nemperor Nicholas; this was Count Benkendorv of whom the emperor said: “He\r\nnever set me at variance with anyone, but reconciled me with many.” His\r\nsuccessor in the direction of the third section was Count A. F. Orlov;\r\nhe remained at this post during all the succeeding years of the emperor\r\nNicholas’ reign.\r\n\r\nIn that same year Count E. F. Kankrin who had been minister of finance\r\neven under Alexander I was obliged on account of ill health to leave\r\nthe ministry of which he had been head during twenty-two years. As his\r\nbiographer justly observes Kankrin left Russia as an heritage: “Well\r\norganised finances, a firm metal currency, and a rate of exchange\r\ncorresponding with the requirements of the country. Russia was in\r\nfinancial respects a mighty power whose credit it was impossible to\r\ninjure. And all this was attained without any considerable loans, and\r\nwithout great increase in taxes, by the determination, the thrift and\r\nthe genius of one man, who placed the welfare of the nation above all\r\nconsiderations and understood how to serve it.”\r\n\r\nBut at the same time it must not be forgotten that all these brilliant\r\nresults were attainable only because behind Count Kankrin stood the\r\nemperor Nicholas. The enemies of the minister and of his monetary\r\nreforms were many; but the snares they laid were destroyed before\r\nthe all powerful will of a person who never wavered. This time that\r\ninflexible will was directed in the right path, and the results showed\r\nunprecedented financial progress, in spite of the three wars which it had\r\nbeen impossible for Russia to avoid, despite the ideally peace-loving\r\ndisposition of her ruler; and to these calamities must be added also\r\nthe cholera and bad harvests. Kankrin’s resignation was accompanied by\r\nimportant consequences; he was replaced by the incapable Vrontchenko,\r\nwhile Nicholas took the finances of the empire into his own hands, as he\r\nhad previously acted regarding the other branches of the administration\r\nof the state.\r\n\r\nAmong the old-time servitors of Alexander I, Prince P. M. Volkonski\r\nremained longest in office. He lived until he attained the rank of\r\nfield-marshal and died in 1852, having filled the office of minister of\r\nthe court during twenty-five years.\r\n\r\nOne of the younger workers of the Alexandrine period, P. D. Kisselev,\r\nformer chief of the staff of the second army, attained to unusual\r\neminence in the reign of the emperor Nicholas. In 1825 his star nearly\r\nset forever, but soon it shone again with renewed brilliancy and on his\r\nreturn from the Danubian provinces, which he had administered since 1829,\r\nKisselev was created minister and count. “You will be my chief of the\r\nstaff for the peasant department,” said the emperor to him, and with this\r\nobject, on the 13th of January, 1838 there was established the ministry\r\nof state domains, formed from the department which had until that time\r\nbeen attached to the ministry of finance.\r\n\r\n\r\nGREAT FIRE IN THE WINTER PALACE\r\n\r\nA disastrous fire at the Winter Palace began on the evening of the 29th\r\nof December, 1837, and no human means were able to stay the flames; only\r\nthe Hermitage with its collection of ancient and priceless treasures was\r\nsaved. The ruins of the palace continued to burn during three days and\r\nnights. The emperor and the imperial family took up their abode in the\r\nAnitchkov palace.\r\n\r\nThe rebuilding of the Winter Palace upon its previous plan was begun\r\nimmediately; the palace was consecrated on the 6th of April, 1839 and the\r\nemperor and his family were installed there as previously. As a token of\r\ngratitude to all those who had taken part in the rebuilding of the palace\r\na medal was struck with the inscription: “I thank you.”--“Work overcomes\r\neverything.”\r\n\r\nOn the last day of the Easter holidays the emperor Nicholas resolved to\r\nallow visitors access to all the state rooms, galleries, etc.; and in\r\nthat one day as many as 200,000 persons visited the palace between the\r\nhours of six in the evening and two in the morning.\r\n\r\nTwice the emperor and his family passed in all directions through the\r\npalace that was thronged with the public. An eye-witness writes that\r\n“the public by prolonging their visitation for seven hours so filled the\r\npalace with damp, steamy, suffocating air that the walls, the columns,\r\nand carvings on the lower windows sweated, and streams of damp poured\r\ndown on to the parquet flooring and spoiled everything, while the marble\r\nchanged to a dull yellowish hue.” 35,000 paper rubles were required to\r\nrepair the damage. But the matter did not terminate with this; during one\r\nnight that summer, fortunately while the imperial family were staying\r\nat Peterhov, the ceiling in the saloon of St. George fell down with the\r\nseventeen massive lustres depending from it.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE 25TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE CORONATION OF NICHOLAS I (1851 A.D.)\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [1851 A.D.]]\r\n\r\nIn August 1851, upon the occasion of the twenty-fifth anniversary\r\nof his coronation the emperor Nicholas left St. Petersburg for\r\nMoscow, accompanied by his family. For the first time the journey was\r\naccomplished by the newly completed Moscow railway, constructed in\r\naccordance with the will of the emperor, and in opposition to the desires\r\nof many of his enlightened contemporaries. The opening of the railway to\r\nthe public followed only on the 13th of November. In Moscow the emperor\r\nwas met by Field-marshal Paskevitch, prince of Warsaw. On the eve of\r\nthe festivities in honour of the anniversary of the coronation Nicholas\r\nvisited the field-marshal, and addressed the following memorable words to\r\nhim:\r\n\r\n“To-morrow will complete twenty-five years of my reign--a reign which\r\nyou, Ivan Feodorovitch, have made illustrious by your valiant service\r\nto Russia. It was under sorrowful prognostications that I ascended\r\nthe throne of Russia and my reign had to begin with punishments and\r\nbanishments. I did not find around the throne persons who could guide\r\nthe czar--I was obliged to create men; I had none devoted to me. Affairs\r\nin the east required the appointment there of a man of your intellect,\r\nof your military capacity, of your will. My choice rested on you.\r\nProvidence itself directed me to you. You had enemies: in spite of all\r\nthat was said against you, I held fast to you, Ivan Feodorovitch. You\r\nproved, commander, that I was right. Hardly had affairs in the east\r\nquieted down when my empire was overtaken by a public calamity--the\r\ncholera. The people ascribe every misfortune to the person who governs.\r\nGod knows how much suffering this national affliction cost me. The war\r\nwith Poland was another grievous trial. Russian blood was shed because\r\nof our errors or because of chastisement sent from above. Our affairs\r\nwere in a bad way. And again I had resource to you, Ivan Feodorovitch, as\r\nthe only means of salvation for Russia; and again you did not betray my\r\ntrust, again you exalted my empire. By your twenty years’ administration\r\nof the Polish land you have laid the foundation for the happiness of\r\ntwo kindred yet hostile elements. I hope that the Russian and the Pole\r\nwill constitute one Russian Empire--the Slavonic Empire; and that your\r\nname will be preserved in history beside the name of Nicholas. It is\r\nnot so long ago--when western Europe was agitated by aspirations after\r\nwild, unbridled freedom; when the people overthrew lawful authority and\r\nthrones; when I decided to give a helping hand to my brother and ally,\r\nthe monarch of Austria--that you, commander, led my soldiers to a new\r\nwarfare: you tamed the hydra of rebellion. In six weeks you had finished\r\nthe war in Hungary, you supported and strengthened the tottering throne\r\nof Austria, Ivan Feodorovitch. You are the glory of my twenty-five years’\r\nreign. You are the history of the reign of Nicholas I.”\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE EMPEROR NICHOLAS’ VIEWS ON LOUIS NAPOLEON\r\n\r\nWhen Prince Louis Napoleon had accomplished his _coup d’état_ of the\r\n2nd of December, 1851, and the restoration of the second empire was to\r\nbe expected, the emperor Nicholas, judging by a letter which he had\r\nreceived from Frederick William IV, said: “Before the end of next year\r\nLouis Napoleon will become our colleague. Let him become what he likes,\r\neven the great mufti, if it pleases him, but to the title of Emperor or\r\nKing I do not think he will be so imprudent as to aspire.” According to\r\nthe emperor’s opinion, as soon as Louis Napoleon desired to make himself\r\nemperor he would become a usurper, because he did not possess the divine\r\nright--he would be emperor in fact but never by right; in a word, “a\r\nsecond Louis Philippe, less the odious character of that scoundrel.”\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [1853 A.D.]]\r\n\r\nWhen the French diplomatic representatives in St. Petersburg and Warsaw\r\nevidenced an intention to celebrate the 15th of August, the emperor\r\nNicholas drew up the following resolution: “A public church service\r\nfor Napoleon cannot be allowed, because he ceased to be emperor, being\r\nbanished and confined to the island of St. Helena. There is no propriety\r\nin celebrating the birthday of the late Napoleon in our country, whence\r\nhe was despatched with befitting honour.” The Napoleonic empire had\r\nalready transcended the limits which the emperor Nicholas would at one\r\ntime have allowed; it was in direct contradiction to the stipulations\r\nof the congress of Vienna, which formed the basis of the national law\r\nof Europe. The emperor’s allies, however, looked on the matter somewhat\r\ndifferently. Austria and Prussia recognised Napoleon III; it therefore\r\nonly remained to the emperor Nicholas, against his will, to follow their\r\nexample; but still he departed from the usually accepted diplomatic\r\nforms, and in his letter to Napoleon III he did not call him brother, but\r\n“_le bon ami_” (good friend). Soon on the political horizon appeared the\r\nEastern question, artfully put forward with a secret motive by Napoleon\r\nIII; his cunning calculations were justified without delay; the Russian\r\ntroops crossed the Pruth in 1853, and occupied the principality, as\r\na guarantee, until the demands presented to the Ottoman Porte by the\r\nemperor Nicholas were complied with. Austrian ingratitude opened a safe\r\npath for the snares of Anglo-French diplomacy. The Eastern War began, at\r\nfirst upon Turkish territory and afterwards concentrated itself in the\r\nCrimean peninsula around Sebastopol; France, England, and afterwards,\r\nin 1855, little Sardinia, in alliance with Turkey, took up arms against\r\nRussia; on the side of the allies lay the sympathy of all neutral Europe,\r\nwhich already dreamed of wresting Russia’s conquests from her.[b]\r\n\r\n\r\nEVENTS LEADING UP TO THE CRIMEAN WAR\r\n\r\nThe revolution of July, 1830, by threatening Europe with the ideas then\r\ntriumphing in France, had tightened the bonds, previously a little\r\nrelaxed, between the czar and the two great German powers, Austria and\r\nPrussia. Independently of diplomatic conferences, the three monarchs had\r\nfrequent interviews for the purpose of adopting measures to oppose the\r\ninvasion of the revolutionary principle. Even whilst affecting to abandon\r\nthe west to the dissolution towards which he felt it was marching, and to\r\nregard it as afflicted with approaching senility, Nicholas by no means\r\nlost sight of its development. But the East, then in combustion, remained\r\nthe true mark of Russian policy. A movement was on foot for the overthrow\r\nof the declining Ottoman power, and its substitution by an Arab power,\r\ninaugurated by Muhammed Ali, the pasha of Egypt. France regarded this\r\nmovement with no unfriendly eye, but Russia entered a protest. By giving\r\nthe most colossal proportions to this Eastern Question, which extended\r\nas far as the countries of central Asia, the situation created grave\r\nembarrassments for the British government. For, to begin with, when, in\r\n1833, Ibrahim Pasha, at the head of the Egyptian army, was ready to cross\r\nthe Taurus and march on Constantinople, within two months the northern\r\npower (summoned to aid by that very sultan whom Russia had hitherto\r\nso greatly humiliated) landed on the Asiatic coast of the Bosporus a\r\nbody of fifteen thousand men in readiness to protect that capital;\r\nthen the secret treaty of Unkiar-Skelessi (July 8th, 1833) granted her,\r\nas the price of an offensive and defensive alliance with the Porte,\r\nthe withdrawal in her exclusive favour of the prohibition forbidding\r\narmed vessels of foreign nations to enter the waters of Constantinople;\r\nfinally, by the conclusion of the Treaty of London July 15th, 1840, which\r\nleft France, still obstinately attached to the cause of Muhammed Ali,\r\noutside the European concert, she had the joy of causing the rupture of\r\nthe _entente cordiale_ between that country and Great Britain--but only\r\nmomentarily, for a new treaty, concluded the 13th of July, 1841, likewise\r\nin London, readmitted the French government to the concert.\r\n\r\nThe events of the year 1848, by bringing back the Russians into Moldavia\r\nand Wallachia, afforded Europe new apprehensions relative to the\r\npreservation, growing daily more difficult, of the Ottoman Empire and\r\nthe political balance, the latter of which was seriously threatened\r\nif not destroyed by the colossus of the north, with its population\r\nnow increased to as much as sixty-five million souls. But Germany was\r\nabsorbed by the serious situation of her own affairs, to which the czar\r\nwas far from remaining a stranger; and the latter linked himself by new\r\nties to Austria, in whose favour he had already renounced his share in\r\nthe protectorate over the republic of Cracow, when at the request of the\r\nVienna cabinet he marched against insurgent Hungary (June, 1849) an army\r\nwhich beat the insurrectionary forces, compelled them to submission,\r\nand thus closed the abyss in which one of the oldest monarchies of\r\nChristendom was about to be engulfed. Then, in 1850, chosen as arbiter\r\nbetween Austria and Prussia, who were on the point of a rupture, the\r\nczar turned the scale in favour of Austria, and kept Prussia in check by\r\nthreats.\r\n\r\n“Austria will soon astonish the world by her immense ingratitude”: this\r\nfamous prophetic saying of Prince Felix of Schwarzenberg, prime minister\r\nof the young emperor Francis Joseph, was not slow of accomplishment. The\r\ningratitude was a necessity which the history of Austria explains; for\r\nin her case, as for the rest of Europe, the continued and immoderate\r\naggrandisement of Russia was the greatest of dangers. This leads us, in\r\nfinishing this general glance over the history of the period, to say a\r\nword on the complications which, at the moment of the empire’s attaining\r\nits apogee, commenced for it a new phase.\r\n\r\nWe have elsewhere explained the final cause of the decay of Turkey. That\r\ndecay was consummated in favour of the northern neighbour who followed\r\nwith attentive gaze the progress of what she called the death struggle.\r\nCertain words pronounced by the autocrat on this subject, and consigned\r\nto diplomatic despatches, had, not long ago, a great circulation. But\r\nthe influence of Russia was counterbalanced by that of France and that\r\nof Great Britain. The cabinets of Paris and Vienna obtained important\r\nconcessions, we might say diplomatic triumphs, from Constantinople--the\r\none in relation to the Holy Places, the other on the subject of\r\nMontenegro. Russian jealousy immediately awoke. According to the czar,\r\nTurkey had a choice between two things only: she must regard Prussia\r\nas either her greatest friend or her greatest enemy. To remind her of\r\nthis, and to neutralise the embassy of the prince of Linanges on behalf\r\nof Austria, Nicholas sent Prince Menshikov, one of his ministers and\r\nconfidants, to Constantinople. Arriving February 28th, 1853, Menshikov\r\nexhibited a haughty and irritable demeanour; and, after astonishing the\r\nDivan by his noisy opposition, put forward pretensions relative to the\r\nHoly Places which were only designed to lull the vigilance of England,\r\nbut were soon followed by others more serious and exorbitant; for\r\nthey amounted to nothing less than the restoration to the czar of the\r\nprotectorate over all the sultan’s subjects professing the Græco-Russian\r\nworship--that is to say the great majority of the inhabitants of Turkey\r\nin Europe.\r\n\r\n\r\nOUTBREAK OF THE CRIMEAN WAR (1853 A.D.)\r\n\r\nIn vain the Divan protested; in vain the friendly powers interceded.\r\nUnable to obtain the satisfaction he was demanding with the extreme of\r\nviolence, the Russian ambassador extraordinary quitted the Bosporous\r\nwith menace on his lips. And, in effect, on the 2nd of July, the czar’s\r\ntroops crossed the Pruth to occupy, contrary to all treaty stipulations,\r\nthe two Danubian principalities. Nicholas was not prepared for war and\r\ndid not expect to be obliged to have recourse to that last appeal; he\r\nhoped to triumph over the Divan by audacity. Moreover, he did not think\r\nthe western powers were in a position to come to an understanding and\r\nto act in common. He was mistaken: Turkey’s death struggle did not\r\nprevent her from making a supreme effort to sell her life dearly, if it\r\nwere impossible for her to save it; and on the 26th of September the\r\nsultan declared war on the aggressor. Hostilities began in the course\r\nof the month of October, first on the Danube and afterwards in Asia,\r\nwhere a surprise made the Turks masters of the little maritime fort of\r\nSt. Nicholas or Chefketil. The Porte was not long abandoned to its own\r\nresources, for the time of political torpor in regard to the territorial\r\naggrandisement of the Muscovite colossus had gone by; the eyes of all\r\nwere at last opened and a European crisis was inevitable. At that moment,\r\nthe fleets of France and England were already at the entrance of the\r\nDardanelles; and even before the end of October these fine naval armies\r\npassed the straits under the authority of a firman, and approached\r\nConstantinople. In consequence of the position taken up by these two\r\nstates, the autocrat broke off relations with them in the beginning of\r\nFebruary, 1854. On the 21st of the same month he informed his subjects of\r\nthe fact in a manifesto, recalling to some extent, by its tone, by its\r\nbiblical references, and its exalted language, the Treaty of the Holy\r\nAlliance. It may be worth while to reproduce here the following passage:\r\n\r\n“Against Russia fighting for orthodoxy England and France enter the lists\r\nas champions of the enemies of Christianity. But Russia will not fail in\r\nher sacred vocation; if the frontier is invaded by the enemy we are ready\r\nto resist him with the energy of which our ancestors have bequeathed us\r\nthe example. Are we not to-day still the same people whose valour was\r\nattested by the memorable displays of the year 1812? May the Most High\r\naid us to prove it by our deeds. In this hope, and fighting for our\r\noppressed brothers who confess the faith of Christ, Russia will have but\r\none heart and voice to cry: ‘God, our Saviour! whom have we to fear? Let\r\nChrist arise and let his enemies be scattered!’”\r\n\r\n\r\nFRANCE, ENGLAND, AND TURKEY IN ALLIANCE\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [1854 A.D.]]\r\n\r\nThus, by an almost miraculous concourse of circumstances, an alliance was\r\nformed between France and England, those two ancient and ardent rivals.\r\nPreceded by a formal alliance with the Porte (March 12th), it was signed\r\nin London, April 10th, 1854. This was not all: this memorable document\r\nwas immediately submitted to the governments of Austria and Prussia and\r\nsanctioned by a protocol signed at Vienna by the four powers, by which\r\nthe justice of the cause sustained by those of the west was solemnly\r\nproclaimed. Austria and Prussia laid down the conditions of their\r\neventual participation in the war in another treaty, that of Berlin,\r\nof the 20th of April, 1854, to which the Germanic Confederation on its\r\nside gave its adhesion. Finally at Baïadji-Keui, on the 14th of June,\r\n1854, the great Danubian power also concluded a treaty with the Ottoman\r\nPorte, in virtue of which she was authorised to enter into military\r\noccupation of the principalities, whether she should have previously\r\nexpelled the Russian army or whether the latter should of its own will\r\nhave decided to evacuate them. Russia was in the most complete isolation;\r\nthe Scandinavian states, who had hitherto been her allies, declared\r\nthemselves neutral; an insurrection in her favour, which was preparing in\r\nServia, was prevented; that of the Greeks, openly favoured by King Otto,\r\nwas stifled. The Turks, thus effectively protected, were able to turn\r\nall their forces on the frontiers, and to prove by heroic acts that they\r\nhad not lost all the bravery of their ancestors. In return for Europe’s\r\nefforts in favour of the integrity of his empire, and in order to ward\r\noff the reproach they might incur by supporting the cause of the crescent\r\nagainst a Christian state, the sultan as early as the 6th of June, 1854,\r\npublished an edict or _irade_, by which he improved in a notable manner\r\nthe condition of the rayas, and prepared for their civil freedom, as well\r\nas for a complete remodelling of the laws which, governing up to that\r\nday the internal government of the Ottoman Empire, seemed to render its\r\npreservation almost impossible.\r\n\r\nThus that movement of expansion to which Russia had been impelled during\r\nfour centuries, and which by conquest after conquest, due either to\r\ndiplomacy or the sword, had made Russian power the bugbear of Europe,\r\nfinds itself suddenly arrested. “Republican or Cossack,” was the famous\r\nprognostic of Napoleon.[c]\r\n\r\nThe immense superiority of the marines belonging to the allies made it\r\npossible to attack Russia on every sea. They bombarded the military port\r\nof Odessa on the Black Sea (April 22nd, 1854), but respected the city\r\nand the commercial port; the Russian establishments in the Caucasus had\r\nbeen burned by the Russians themselves. They blockaded Kronstadt on\r\nthe Baltic, landed on the islands of Åland, and took the fortress of\r\nBomarsund (August 16th, 1854).[f]\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE TAKING OF BOMARSUND\r\n\r\nThis fight had lasted from four in the morning until four in the\r\nevening, when the allies saw a white flag over the tower battlements.\r\nThe commander asked an armistice of two hours, which was granted. He\r\nrecommenced firing before the interval was over. The French batteries\r\noverthrew the armaments, whilst the Vincennes _chasseurs_ acting as\r\nfree-shooters attacked the cannoneers. Resistance ceased towards evening\r\nand the tower yielded at three o’clock in the morning. One officer\r\nand thirty men were made prisoners. On Monday no notice was taken of\r\nprovocation from the fortress, but preparations were made for the morrow.\r\n\r\nOn the morning of August 15th the English attacked the north tower.\r\nIn six hours three of their large cannon had been able to pierce the\r\ngranite and make a breach of twenty feet. The north tower was not long\r\nin surrendering; four English and two French vessels directed their fire\r\non the large fortress. A white flag was hoisted on the rampart nearest\r\nthe sea. Two officers of the fleet were sent to the governor, who said,\r\n“I yield to the marine.” This officer had only a few dead and seventy\r\nwounded, but smoke poured in through the badly constructed windows, bombs\r\nburst in the middle of the fortress, without mentioning the carbine fire\r\nof the free-shooters. A longer resistance was useless.[g]\r\n\r\nIn 1855 the Russians bombarded Sveaborg. The allies attacked the\r\nfortified monastery of Solovetski, in the White Sea, and in the sea of\r\nOkhotsk they blockaded the Siberian ports, destroyed the arsenals of\r\nPetropavlovsk, and disturbed the tranquillity of the Russians on the\r\nriver Amur.\r\n\r\nMenaced by the Austrian concentration in Transylvania, and by the landing\r\nof English and French troops at Gallipoli and Varna, the Russians made\r\na last and vain attempt to gain possession of Silistria, which they\r\nhad held in a state of siege from April to July at the cost of a great\r\nnumber of men. In the Dobrudja an expedition directed by the French was\r\nwithout result from a military point of view, the soldiers being thinned\r\nout by cholera and paludal fevers. The Russians decided to evacuate the\r\nprincipalities, which were at once occupied by the Austrians in accord\r\nwith Europe and the sultan. The war on the Danube was at an end.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SEAT OF WAR TRANSFERRED TO THE CRIMEA (1854 A.D.)\r\n\r\nThe war in the Crimea was just about to commence.[f] Siege-trains were\r\nordered from England and France, transports were prepared, and other\r\npreparations were gradually made. But the cholera attacked both the\r\narmies and the fleets, which for two months lay prostrate under this\r\ndreadful scourge.\r\n\r\nIn the Black Sea, meantime, the preparations for the Crimean expedition\r\nwere pressed forward with greater energy in proportion as the cholera\r\nabated. But many successive delays occurred. Originally the invading\r\nforce was to have sailed on the 15th of August; then the 20th was the\r\nday; then the 22nd; then the 26th; then the 1st of September (by which\r\ntime the French siege-train would have arrived at Varna); then the 2nd\r\nof September. At length all was ready; and 58,000, out of 75,000 men,\r\ncavalry, infantry, and artillery, were embarked at Baltjik on the 7th.\r\nThe French numbered 25,000, the English the same; and there was a picked\r\ncorps of about 8,000 Turks. In a flotilla of between two and three\r\nhundred vessels, this first and much larger part of the united army were\r\ntransported up the coast to Fidonisi, or the Island of Serpents; from\r\nwhich point to Cape Tarkhan, in the Crimea, they would make both the\r\nshortest and the most sheltered passage. Being reviewed and found all\r\nready at Fidonisi, the armada took its second departure on the 11th, and\r\nreached without accident the destined shore on the 14th. On that day\r\nthe troops were landed prosperously at “Old Fort,” some twenty miles\r\nbeyond Eupatoria, or Koslov, within four or five easy days’ march from\r\nSebastopol. Upon this great fortress the columns were at once directed;\r\nwhile the transports returned in haste to fetch the reserves, amounting\r\nto about 15,000 men.\r\n\r\nContrary to the expectation of the allies, Prince Menshikov, who\r\ncommanded in the Crimea, had resolved not to oppose their landing, but to\r\nawait them on the left, or southern, bank of the river Alma. The nature\r\nof his position may be gathered from Lord Raglan’s despatch. He says:\r\n\r\n“In order that the gallantry exhibited by her majesty’s troops, and the\r\ndifficulties they had to meet, may be fairly estimated, I deem it right,\r\neven at the risk of being considered tedious, to endeavour to make you\r\nacquainted with the position the Russians had taken up.\r\n\r\n“It crossed the great road about two miles and a half from the sea,\r\nand is very strong by nature. The bold and almost precipitous range of\r\nheights, of from 350 to 400 feet, that from the sea closely border the\r\nleft bank of the river, here ceases and formed their left, and turning\r\nthence round a great amphitheatre or wide valley, terminates at a salient\r\npinnacle where their right rested, and whence the descent to the plain\r\nwas more gradual. The front was about two miles in extent. Across the\r\nmouth of this great opening is a lower ridge at different heights,\r\nvarying from 60 to 150 feet, parallel to the river, and at distances\r\nfrom it of from 600 to 800 yards. The river itself is generally fordable\r\nfor troops, but its banks are extremely rugged, and in most parts steep;\r\nthe willows along it had been cut down, in order to prevent them from\r\naffording cover to the attacking party, and in fact everything had been\r\ndone to deprive an assailant of any species of shelter. In front of the\r\nposition on the right bank, at about 200 yards from the Alma, is the\r\nvillage of Burliuk, and near it a timber bridge, which had been partly\r\ndestroyed by the enemy. The high pinnacle and ridge before alluded\r\nto was the key of the position, and consequently, there the greatest\r\npreparations had been made for defence. Half-way down the height and\r\nacross its front was a trench of the extent of some hundred yards, to\r\nafford cover against an advance up the even steep slope of the hill. On\r\nthe right, and a little retired, was a powerful covered battery, armed\r\nwith heavy guns, which flanked the whole of the right of the position.\r\nArtillery, at the same time, was posted at the points that best commanded\r\nthe passage of the river and its approaches generally. On the slopes of\r\nthese hills (forming a sort of table land) were placed dense masses of\r\nthe enemy’s infantry, whilst on the height above was his great reserve,\r\nthe whole amounting, it is supposed, to between 45,000 and 50,000 men.”\r\n\r\nIt was against this fortress--for it was little less--the British,\r\nFrench, and Turkish forces were led, having broken up their camp at\r\nKimishi on the 19th of September. The way led along continual steppes,\r\naffording no shelter from the burning heat of the sun, nor water to\r\nassuage the intolerable thirst suffered by all. The only relief was\r\nafforded by the muddy stream of Bulganak, which the men drank with\r\navidity. That day an insignificant skirmish took place between a body of\r\nCossacks and the light division. On passing over the brow of a hill, the\r\nformer were discovered drawn up in order. A slight fire was opened, which\r\nwounded three or four of the allies, but a gun drove up and threw a shell\r\nwith such wonderful precision in the midst of the enemy that above a\r\ndozen were knocked over by this one projectile, and the Cossacks speedily\r\ndisappeared.[d]\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE BATTLE OF THE ALMA (1854 A.D.)\r\n\r\nThe allies’ plan of aggression was quite as simple as the Russian plan\r\nof defence. It consisted in turning the enemy’s two wings and then\r\noverwhelming them by a front attack. On the extreme right General\r\nBosquet, in advance of the rest of the army, was to approach rapidly the\r\nAlma, cross it at a point not far from its mouth, ascend the slopes at\r\nall costs, then fall suddenly on the Russians’ left, surround them, and\r\nthrow them back on the centre. This movement carried out, Canrobert’s and\r\nPrince Napoleon’s divisions, supported by a portion of the English army,\r\nwould cross the river, climb the heights between Almatamak and Burliuk,\r\nand make the grand attack. At the same moment the English army at the\r\nleft of the French lines would endeavour to turn the enemy’s right, and\r\nthus secure the day. Forey’s division would remain in reserve ready to\r\nhelp either the weaker columns or those in immediate danger, as the\r\ncase might be. On the evening of the 19th of September Field-Marshal\r\nSaint-Arnaud had sent to each division a tracing of the proposed order of\r\nbattle. The plan was so simple that the soldiers had already anticipated\r\nand guessed it. At nightfall they gathered round the camp fires and\r\ndiscussed the chances of the plan with gleeful excitement. They pointed\r\nout to each other the Russian camp fires, scintillating dots of light\r\nshining out on the hill sides, and tried to reckon up the enemy’s number\r\nby the number of lights. A good deal of imagination mingled with their\r\ncalculations, but the results did not frighten them, they were convinced\r\nthat the following day they would rest victorious on the plateau.\r\n\r\nAt the first sounds of the reveille the troops of Bosquet’s division were\r\na-foot and ready to start, very proud of the place assigned them by the\r\nconfidence of the commander-in-chief. The fog having somewhat lifted,\r\nat seven o’clock they left the banks of the Bulganak and marched off\r\nin quick time towards the Alma. They were not more than two kilometres\r\ndistant from it when one of the field-marshal’s aides-de-camp arrived\r\nhot-foot with orders to halt, as the English were not ready. Obedience\r\nwas yielded with some degree of unwillingness, which grew to impatience\r\nas the halt was prolonged. It was already half-past eleven when the\r\nmarch was resumed. The division was formed into two columns; Autemarre’s\r\nbrigade marched towards Almatamak, where the French scouts had just\r\ndiscovered a ford; the other brigade, under Bouat, turned towards the\r\nsea, so as to cross the river near its mouth by a sand bank shown them by\r\na steam pinnace. From their dominating positions the Russians could see\r\nthis manœuvre, but they paid no attention to it, judging that nature had\r\nprovided sufficient defence for them on that side. They looked upon the\r\nwhole of this movement as merely a diversion, and concentrated all their\r\nwatchfulness on the main body of the army, which had hitherto remained\r\nmotionless three kilometres to the rear of the Alma.\r\n\r\nIn the mean time Autemarre’s brigade, close on Almatamak and hitherto\r\nhidden from the enemy by the escarpments of the neighbouring cliff,\r\nbegan to cross the Alma. The 3rd zouaves were the first over the ford,\r\nand began with amazing “go” to climb the plateau. This ascent, which\r\nthe Russians, heavily equipped and accustomed to the level, believed\r\nimpossible, was relatively easy for men accustomed time out of mind to\r\nthe foot-tracks of African mountains. It was wonderful to see these\r\nstrong, agile soldiers springing up the slopes, giving a helping hand\r\nto one another, clinging to tufts of grass and scrub, and profiting by\r\nthe smallest foothold. The Algerian sharp-shooters followed, then the\r\n50th foot. The most difficult matter was to get the artillery over,\r\nand the boldest faltered before such a task. By a sheer miracle of\r\nstout-heartedness and energy they managed to hoist several pieces the\r\nwhole length of the escarpments. Suddenly the zouaves appeared at the\r\ntop of the hill, before the very eyes of the astonished Russians, and by\r\na brisk fire drove off the enemy’s vedettes. In another moment Algerian\r\nsharp-shooters and men of the 50th foot climbed the last slopes in their\r\nturn; then the field guns, dragged up to the heights, were placed in\r\nline. At this identical moment Bouat’s brigade, which had been delayed in\r\ncrossing the bar, appeared on the extreme right and began to scale the\r\ncliffs nearest the sea. Only the second battalion of the Minsk infantry\r\noccupied this position, which had hitherto been held impregnable.\r\nDebouching from the little village of Aklese they ran forward; but\r\nconfused by the fantastic aspect of this unexpected enemy, flurried by\r\nthe gaps made in their ranks by the French long-range guns, they wasted\r\nno time over doubling back. Soon, running away altogether, they threw\r\nthemselves on the Russian reserves, followed by the shots of French\r\nartillery and by the missiles thrown on to the plateau by the fleet at\r\nanchor near the shore.\r\n\r\nSaint-Arnaud, from his position in the rear of the Alma, had watched\r\nthe zouaves climb the hill. When they had disappeared over the crest,\r\nhe had listened anxiously for the sharp-shooters to open fire. Soon\r\nthe roar of cannon was heard, but it was difficult to believe that the\r\nartillery was already engaged. “Are they French guns or Russian guns?”\r\nasked the staff-officers grouped round the commander-in-chief. But the\r\nfield-marshal joyfully cried: “I assure you it is Bosquet’s cannon; he\r\nhas reached the heights.” Then searching the distance with his glasses:\r\n“I can see red trousers. Ah! there I recognise my African veteran\r\nBosquet!” Summoning his generals, Saint-Arnaud gave then the final\r\ninstructions. The sound of the guns had revived his failing strength; his\r\nvoice was as strong as in his palmiest days, and his face was lighted up\r\nwith confidence, a last and touching reflection of his warrior spirit. By\r\na gesture he indicated to his officers the course of the river and the\r\nhills which shut in the horizon: “Gentlemen,” he said, “this battle will\r\nbe known as the battle of the Alma.”\r\n\r\nIt being now one o’clock in the afternoon, the front attack was\r\nimmediately begun. The first division, under command of General\r\nCanrobert, held the right; to the left was drawn up the 3rd division\r\ncommanded by Prince Napoleon. Following the common plan, the latter was\r\nto attach itself to the English right, but it did so only imperfectly,\r\non account of the slowness of the allies. Set in motion simultaneously,\r\nthe two French divisions marched towards the Alma. This time the Russians\r\nhad anticipated the attack and were ready to repulse it. Sheltered by\r\nclumps of trees, enclosing walls, and the gardens bordering the river,\r\ninnumerable sharp-shooters directed a well-sustained fire against the\r\nenemy, and, in addition, a battery established on the edge of the plateau\r\ncovered the plain with missiles. Overwhelmed by this murderous fire the\r\nFrench troops halted. But the artillery of the 1st and 3rd divisions\r\nshelled the ravines, compelling the Russian sharp-shooters to retreat\r\nagainst a high bank on the left, and by thus diverting their attention\r\nenabled the rest of the French army to advance as far as the Alma. Laying\r\ndown their knapsacks the soldiers themselves sounded the river with\r\nbranches of trees and boldly crossed wherever it appeared practicable.\r\nTowards two in the afternoon the 3rd division effected a crossing not far\r\nfrom Burluk. As to Canrobert’s division, it had, almost entirely, already\r\nfound a footing on the left bank a little above Almatamak. His first\r\nbattalions had already reached the heights and slanted off to the right\r\nso as to join hands with Bosquet’s division.\r\n\r\nIt was quite time. When Prince Menshikov was informed of the appearance\r\nof Bosquet on the heights near the mouth of the Alma, he at first refused\r\nto believe the news and only the roar of the cannon had convinced him.\r\nRealising the greatness of the danger, the Russian commander-in-chief\r\nimmediately hurried to reinforce his left flank, which in his excess of\r\nconfidence he had left almost uncovered. As the brigades of Autemarre\r\nand Bouat took up a position, fresh Russian troops debouched on the\r\nwestern side of the plateau. First a battery of light artillery, which\r\narrived before the infantry it was summoned to support, lost half its\r\nnumber in a few moments; then four battalions of the Moscow infantry\r\nregiment supported by another battery. Shortly after this occurred,\r\nPrince Menshikov, having himself visited the scene of action, decided\r\nto make a fresh attempt. By his orders three battalions of the Minsk\r\nregiment, four squadrons of hussars and two batteries of Cossacks were\r\ndrawn from the reserve to afford active support to the troops already\r\nengaged. Happily for the French these troops arrived only in driblets,\r\nso that their impact was weakened by being broken up. Even so their\r\nlittle main body, launched on the plateau with no retreat possible,\r\nfound itself in a position almost as critical as it was glorious. If it\r\ncontinued to penetrate into the Russian flank victory was assured, but\r\nif it faltered it had no other prospect than to be brought to bay on\r\none escarpment after another and routed in the valley, beyond hope of\r\nsalvation. The Russian troops were not more numerous than the French, but\r\nthe twelve guns of the latter could scarcely hope to hold out against the\r\nforty pieces which the Russians had brought into this part of the field.\r\nOn receiving overnight the commander-in-chief’s instructions, General\r\nBosquet had replied: “You can count on me, but remember I cannot hold out\r\nfor more than two hours.”\r\n\r\nThe general weariness was great and moreover the ammunition was giving\r\nout. With growing anguish Bosquet turned his gaze towards the plain,\r\nwaiting for the general attack which was to lighten his task. His joy may\r\nbe imagined when he heard on the left, above Almatamak, the sharp crack\r\nof the zouaves’ rifles, and saw appearing over the edge of the plateau\r\nGeneral Canrobert’s first battalions.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ALEXANDER SERGEVITCH MENSHIKOV\r\n\r\n(1787-1869)]\r\n\r\nHelp was at hand, and with help the almost certainty of victory. At that\r\nvery moment a happy inspiration of Saint-Arnaud’s rendered assurance\r\nsure. Judging that the moment had arrived for calling on his reserves, he\r\nsent orders to General Forey to bring up one of his brigades to succour\r\nBosquet, and with the other to support General Canrobert. From that\r\nmoment the tide of battle set steadily against the Russians. Surrounded\r\non their left wing, outflanked in their centre, threatened by the French\r\nreserves, they yielded step by step, no doubt with fearful reprisals, but\r\nfinally they retired. It was in vain that the Minsk and Moscow regiments,\r\nretreating obliquely, tried to resist both Bosquet’s and Canrobert’s\r\ndivisions; these brave endeavours only prolonged the resistance without\r\naffecting the result. After losing the greater number of their leaders\r\nthey were compelled to retreat behind the heights and to retire to a\r\ntower for telegraphic communication which marked the enemy’s centre.\r\nThere a final bloody engagement took place. At last the flags of the 3rd\r\nzouaves and the 39th foot were hoisted on the top of the tower, signal of\r\nthe victory which the Russians thenceforward never disputed.[h]\r\n\r\nThe part taken by the British troops in the final assault is thus\r\ndescribed by the special correspondent of the _Times_:\r\n\r\n“The British line was struggling through the river and up the heights\r\nin masses, firm, indeed, but mowed down by the murderous fire of the\r\nbatteries and by grape, round shot, shell, canister, case shot, and\r\nmusketry, from some of the guns of the central battery, and from an\r\nimmense and compact mass of Russian infantry. Then commenced one of\r\nthe most bloody and determined struggles in the annals of war. The 2nd\r\ndivision, led by Sir De L. Evans in the most dashing manner, crossed the\r\nstream on the right. The 7th Fusiliers, led by Colonel Yea, were swept\r\ndown by fifties. The 55th, 30th, and 95th, led by Brigadier Pennefather,\r\nwho was in the thickest of the fight, cheering on his men, again and\r\nagain were checked indeed, but never drew back in their onward progress,\r\nwhich was marked by a fierce roll of Minié musketry; and Brigadier Adams,\r\nwith the 41st, 47th, and 49th, bravely charged up the hill, and aided\r\nthem in the battle. Sir George Brown, conspicuous on a grey horse, rode\r\nin front of his light division, urging them with voice and gesture.\r\nGallant fellows! they were worthy of such a gallant chief. The 7th,\r\ndiminished by one-half, fell back to re-form their columns lost for the\r\ntime; the 23rd, with eight officers dead and four wounded, were still\r\nrushing to the front, aided by the 19th, 33rd, 77th, and 88th. Down went\r\nSir George in a cloud of dust in front of the battery. He was soon up\r\nand shouted, ‘23rd, I’m all right. Be sure I’ll remember this day,’ and\r\nled them on again, but in the shock produced by the fall of their chief\r\nthe gallant regiment suffered terribly while paralysed for a moment.\r\nMeantime the Guards, on the right of the light division, and the brigade\r\nof Highlanders were storming the heights on the left. Their line was\r\nalmost as regular as though they were in Hyde Park. Suddenly a tornado of\r\nround and grape rushed through from the terrible battery, and a roar of\r\nmusketry from behind thinned their front ranks by dozens. It was evident\r\nthat we were just able to contend against the Russians, favoured as they\r\nwere by a great position. At this very time an immense mass of Russian\r\ninfantry were seen moving down towards the battery. They halted. It was\r\nthe crisis of the day. Sharp, angular, and solid, they looked as if they\r\nwere cut out of the solid rock. It was beyond all doubt that if our\r\ninfantry, harassed and thinned as they were, got into the battery they\r\nwould have to encounter again a formidable fire, which they were but ill\r\ncalculated to bear. Lord Raglan saw the difficulties of the situation.\r\nHe asked if it would be possible to get a couple of guns to bear on\r\nthese masses. The reply was, ‘Yes,’ and an artillery officer (Colonel\r\nDixon) brought up two guns to fire on the Russian squares. The first shot\r\nmissed, but the next, and the next, and the next cut through the ranks\r\nso cleanly, and so keenly, that a clear lane could be seen for a moment\r\nthrough the square. After a few rounds the square became broken, wavered\r\nto and fro, broke, and fled over the brow of the hill, leaving behind it\r\nsix or seven distinct lines of dead, lying as close as possible to each\r\nother, marking the passage of the fatal messengers. This act relieved our\r\ninfantry of a deadly incubus, and they continued their magnificent and\r\nfearful progress up the hill. The duke encouraged his men by voice and\r\nexample, and proved himself worthy of his proud command and of the royal\r\nrace from which he comes. ‘Highlanders,’ said Sir C. Campbell, ere they\r\ncame to the charge, ‘don’t pull a trigger till you’re within a yard of\r\nthe Russians!’ They charged, and well they obeyed their chieftain’s wish;\r\nSir Colin had his horse shot under him, but his men took the battery at\r\na bound. The Russians rushed out, and left multitudes of dead behind\r\nthem. The Guards had stormed the right of the battery ere the Highlanders\r\ngot into the left, and it is said the Scots Fusilier Guards were the\r\nfirst to enter. The second and light division crowned the heights. The\r\nFrench turned the guns on the hill against the flying masses, which the\r\ncavalry in vain tried to cover. A few faint struggles from the scattered\r\ninfantry, a few rounds of cannon and musketry and the enemy fled to the\r\nsoutheast, leaving three generals, three guns, 700 prisoners, and 4,000\r\nwounded behind them. The battle of the Alma was won. It is won with\r\na loss of nearly 3,000 killed and wounded on our side. The Russians’\r\nretreat was covered by their cavalry, but if we had had an adequate\r\nforce we could have captured many guns and multitudes of prisoners.”\r\n\r\nIt appears from papers found in Prince Menshikov’s carriage, that he had\r\ncounted on holding his position on the Alma for at least three weeks.\r\nHe had erected scaffolds from which his ladies might view the military\r\nexploits during the period of obstruction he had provided for the\r\ninvading force, but he was hurried away in the midst of a flying army, in\r\na little more than three hours.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SEIZURE OF BALAKLAVA (1854 A.D.)\r\n\r\nWithout sufficient cavalry, and having exhausted the ammunition of the\r\nartillery, the allies did not pursue the defeated foe; but rested for\r\na couple of days, to recruit the able-bodied, succour the wounded, and\r\nbury the dead. Then they went forward towards Sebastopol. A change now\r\ntook place, as remarkable an incident as any in the campaign. Learning\r\nthat the enemy had established a work of some force on the Belbek, and\r\nthat this river could not readily be rendered a means of communication\r\nwith the fleet, and calculating that preparations would be made for\r\nthe defence of Sebastopol chiefly on the north side, the commanders\r\nresolved to change the line of operations, to turn the whole position\r\nof Sebastopol, and establish themselves at Balaklava. After resting\r\nfor a couple of days, they started on the march, turned to the left\r\nafter the first night’s bivouac, and struck across a woody country,\r\nin which the troops had to steer their way by compass; regained an\r\nopen road from Bagtcheserai to Balaklava; encountered there at Khutor\r\nMackenzia (Mackenzie’s Farm) a part of the Russian army, which fled\r\nin consternation at the unexpected meeting; and were in possession of\r\nBalaklava on the 26th--within four days after leaving the heights above\r\nthe Alma. Thus an important post was occupied without a blow.\r\n\r\nBalaklava is a close port, naturally cut by the waters in the living\r\nrock; so deep that the bowsprit of a ship at anchor can almost be\r\ntouched on shore, so strong that the force possessing it could retain\r\ncommunication with the sea in spite of any enemy. It is a proof of\r\nMenshikov’s want of foresight, or of his extreme weakness after the\r\nbattle of the 20th, that Balaklava was left without effectual defence.\r\nThe change of operations reminds one of Nelson’s manœuvre at the Nile, in\r\nattacking the enemy on the shore side, where the ships were logged with\r\nlumber and unprepared for action.\r\n\r\nBy this date, however, the allies were destined to sustain a grave loss,\r\nin the departure of Marshal Saint-Arnaud. The French commander-in-chief\r\nhad succeeded in three achievements, each one of which would be\r\nsufficient to mark the great soldier. He had thrown his forces into\r\nthe battle on the Alma with all the ardour of which his countrymen are\r\ncapable, but with that perfect command which the great general alone\r\nretains. He had succeeded in exciting the soldierly fire of the French,\r\nand yet in preserving the friendliest feelings towards their rivals\r\nand allies, the English. He had succeeded in retaining his place on\r\nhorseback, notwithstanding mortal agonies that would have subdued the\r\ncourage, or at least the physical endurance, of any other man. Many can\r\nmeet death, numbers can sustain torture; but the power of holding out\r\nin action against the depressing and despairing misgivings of internal\r\nmaladies, is a kind of resolution which nature confers upon very few\r\nindeed, and amongst those very few Marshal Saint-Arnaud will be ranked\r\nas one of the most distinguished. He was succeeded in the command of the\r\nFrench army by General Canrobert, and died at sea on the 29th. By this\r\nevent Lord Raglan became commander-in-chief of the allied forces in the\r\nCrimea.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ADVANCE ON SEBASTOPOL\r\n\r\nHad Marshal Saint-Arnaud lived, it is hardly to be doubted that he would\r\nhave attempted to take Sebastopol by the summary process of breaching and\r\nstorming instead of the slower one of a regular siege. The former plan\r\nmight have been successful, for it is now known, upon the authority of\r\nthe Russians themselves, that when the allies first broke ground before\r\nthe fortress its preparations for resistance were very incomplete. On\r\nthe other hand, events have too painfully demonstrated that the force\r\nwith which the siege was undertaken was totally inadequate, both in\r\nnumbers and weight of metal. It was not sufficient to invest the place on\r\nevery side, or to hinder the garrison of one of the strongest fortresses\r\nin the world from receiving unlimited reinforcements and supplies of\r\nall kinds. Hence, to use General Peyronnet Thompson’s homely but very\r\napt illustration, the operations before Sebastopol have hitherto been\r\nlike the work of drawing a badger out of one end of a box, with an\r\ninterminable series of badgers entering at the other.\r\n\r\nThe position occupied by the English before Sebastopol was to the right\r\nof the French, at a distance of six miles from their ships. They held the\r\nsummit of a ridge, whence at long range, they could fire with some effect\r\non the Russian outworks; but as they descended the slope, their force\r\nwas broken in two or three parts, while they were exposed to a fire like\r\nthat which destroyed so many brave men at the Alma. The French, on the\r\nleft, rested on Cape Chersonesus, and were within three miles of their\r\nships, in a position where, though they might suffer from the fire of\r\nthe garrison, they were protected from the attacks of the Russian army\r\nin the field. The attack on the place by the land batteries and by the\r\nships began on the 17th of October. The Russians had closed the entrance\r\nto the harbour by sinking two ships of the fine and two frigates (they\r\nsubsequently sank all the rest of their fleet), and the fire of the\r\nallied ships at long range produced so very little effect, whilst the\r\ncasualties sustained by them were so disproportionate to the damage they\r\ninflicted, that the experiment was not repeated.\r\n\r\nEight days afterwards the Russians in turn became the assailants. A large\r\nreinforcement having been received under Liprandi, that general was\r\ndetached to the Tchernaia with some 30,000 troops to attack our rear. The\r\npeculiarity of the position of the allied army facilitated its efforts.\r\nIt has already been explained that Balaklava is at some distance from the\r\nlines of the besiegers. The road connecting the two runs through a gorge\r\nin the heights which constitute the rear of the British position, and\r\nwhich overlook the small grassy plain that lies to the north of the inlet\r\nof Balaklava. The possession of the port and the connecting road are\r\nessential to the success of the siege. To defend them, Lord Raglan had\r\nplaced a body of marines and sailors with some heavy guns on the heights\r\nabove the village and landing place of Balaklava; beneath the heights\r\nhe had stationed the 93rd Highlanders, under Sir Colin Campbell, who\r\nbarred the road down to the village. The plain running northward towards\r\nthe Tchernaia is intersected by a low, irregular ridge, about two miles\r\nand a half from the village, and running nearly at right angles to the\r\nrear of the heights on the northwestern slopes of which lay the British\r\narmy. This ridge in the plain was defended by four redoubts, intervening\r\nbetween the Tchernaia and the British cavalry encamped on the southern\r\npart of the plain; and the rising ground in their rear was held by the\r\nzouaves, who had entrenched themselves at right angles with the redoubts.\r\nThe extreme right of our position was on the road to Kamara; the centre\r\nabout Kadakoi, with the Turkish redoubts in front; the left on the\r\neastern slopes of the high lands running up to the Inkerman ravine.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE BATTLE OF BALAKLAVA\r\n\r\nThe object of the Russians was to turn the right and seize Balaklava,\r\nburn the shipping in the port, and, cutting off our communication with\r\nthe sea, establish themselves in our rear. To accomplish this, General\r\nLiprandi gathered up his troops behind the defiles at Tchorgun on the\r\nTchernaia. Here, having previously reconnoitred our position, he divided\r\nhis forces on the morning of the 25th of October, directing one body by\r\nthe great military road, the other by Kamara, and debouching upon the\r\nplain near the Turkish redoubts. The redoubts were armed with two or\r\nthree heavy ship-guns, and each manned by about 250 Turks. The Russians\r\ncoming on with the dawn, some 12,000 strong, with from thirty to forty\r\nfield-guns, attacked the redoubts with horse artillery, and carried them\r\nin succession; the Turks firing a few shots, and then flying in disorder\r\nunder a fire of artillery and the swords of the Cossacks. Sir Colin\r\nCampbell, aroused by the firing, instantly drew up the 93rd in front of\r\nthe village of Kadakoi; and the affrighted Turks rallied for a moment\r\non the flanks of that “living wall of brass,” to use the language of\r\na French writer, presented by the Highlanders. But the redoubts being\r\ntaken, the enemy’s artillery advanced and opened fire; and the cavalry\r\ncame rapidly up. As the 93rd was within range, Sir Colin Campbell drew\r\nthem a little backward behind the crest of the hill. The British cavalry\r\nlay to the left of the Highlanders, and a large body of Russian cavalry\r\nmenaced both. The larger section went towards the encampment of the\r\nBritish cavalry, and were met at once by the heavy brigade, under General\r\nScarlett. A brief but brilliant encounter followed: for a moment the\r\nGreys and Enniskillens in the first line seemed swallowed up, in another\r\nthey reappeared victorious. The long, dense line of the Russian horse had\r\nlapped over their flanks; but the second British line, consisting of the\r\n4th and 5th Dragoons, charging, the Russians were broken and rapidly made\r\noff. While this was proceeding, a body of some 400 cavalry rode at the\r\nHighlanders, who, not deigning to form square, mounted the crest of the\r\nhill, behind which they had taken shelter, fired in line two deep, and\r\nsent the enemy flying.\r\n\r\nBut the fighting was not yet over. Seven guns taken in the redoubts yet\r\nremained in the possession of the enemy; and Lord Raglan sent an order to\r\nLord Lucan to prevent the enemy from carrying off the guns, if possible.\r\nThe order was wrongly interpreted as a peremptory order to _charge_, and\r\nin that sense it was repeated by Lord Lucan to Lord Cardigan, who obeyed\r\nit and charged into the very centre of the enemy’s position, with a\r\ndesperate sacrifice of men, but not without inflicting severe blows upon\r\nthe enemy. Nor was the loss of life entirely a waste. To the Russians the\r\nincident proved the unmeasured daring of the foe they had to face; to the\r\nBritish troops it showed the lengths to which discipline and fidelity can\r\nbe carried. The light cavalry brigade mustered 607 sabres that morning;\r\nin the twenty minutes occupied by the charge and the return, they lost\r\n335 horses, and had nearly as many officers and men killed or wounded.\r\nThe heavy dragoons and the Chasseurs d’Afrique covered the retreat of\r\nthe bleeding remnant of this daring band. It was now nearly noon: the\r\nfourth division, under Sir George Cathcart, and the first division, under\r\nthe Duke of Cambridge, had come up; and the Russians abandoned all the\r\nredoubts, except the furthest one to the right. Nothing more was done\r\nthat day. Looking to the extent of the position previously occupied.\r\nLord Raglan determined to contract his line of defence to the immediate\r\nvicinity of Balaklava and the steeps in the right rear of the British\r\narmy.\r\n\r\nNext day the enemy sallied forth from Sebastopol, 7000 or 8000 strong,\r\nand attacked the right flank of the British army; but, steadily met by\r\nthe second division under Sir De Lacy Evans, supported by the brigade of\r\nGuards, a regiment of Rifles, two guns from the light division, and two\r\nFrench battalions, the Russians were gallantly repelled, and then chased\r\ndown to the slope, with a loss of some 600 killed and wounded, and 80\r\nprisoners.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE BATTLE OF INKERMAN (NOVEMBER 5TH, 1854)\r\n\r\nAnother fierce engagement, the most important of all in which the\r\nbelligerents have yet been engaged, took place on the 5th of November.\r\nFor some days previously, the Russians, who already possessed a large\r\nforce in the prolonged fortifications, and others to the rear of the\r\nallies in the neighbourhood of Balaklava, had been observed to receive\r\nlarge reinforcements, which, added to Liprandi’s corps on the Russian\r\nleft, of 30,000 or more, and the garrison, would probably justify Lord\r\nRaglan’s estimate of 60,000 men arrayed against the allies on the\r\nmemorable 5th of November. To augment the weight of the force brought\r\ndown to crush the besiegers, the now useless army of the Danube had been\r\nwithdrawn from Moldavia, leaving Bessarabia still defended by its special\r\narmy, but not, it is supposed, entirely exhausting the reinforcements\r\nto be brought from the interior. The effort of Menshikov to throw his\r\nstrength into a succession of powerful and, if possible, decisive blows,\r\nis shown by the advance of Dannenberg’s army in the very lightest order,\r\naugmenting the numbers about Sebastopol without much regard either to\r\ntheir equipment or provision. The aim was to bear down by accumulated\r\npressure; and it was with such a view that the batteries resumed the\r\nbombardment of the allies in their besieged camp, a strong force from\r\nthe garrison moved out to act with Dannenberg’s army, and Liprandi made\r\na feint, that might have been, had it succeeded, a penetrating attack\r\ntowards the rear; and as it was, it did busy a portion of the British and\r\nFrench forces. Thus the allies were to be occupied all round, while the\r\nweak, unintrenched, and unfortified point in their position towards the\r\nvalley of the Inkerman was to be penetrated by a force of great weight\r\nand momentum.[d]\r\n\r\nThe English encampments were established between Karabelnaia and the\r\nvalley of the Tchernaia, on a plateau called Inkerman, which two ravines\r\nnarrowed at the south in a way which made it a kind of isthmus. Two\r\nstrong Russian columns, consisting together of thirty-six thousand men,\r\nconverged in this direction. The first came out from Karabelnaia; the\r\nsecond descended from the heights on the opposite bank of the Tchernaia\r\nand crossed that river near its mouth in the bay.\r\n\r\nThey had to join in order to turn the English camp and take it from\r\nthe back. Their movements were badly planned; each acted on its own\r\ninitiative instead of joining. However, the English were in extreme\r\ndanger. The Karabelnaia column surprised one of their divisions and\r\nnearly overwhelmed it by force of numbers. With a small reinforcement the\r\nEnglish disputed every inch of ground with desperation and the struggle\r\nwas prolonged through rain and fog, till the Russian general Soimonov was\r\nmortally wounded; fear struck his battalions: they ceased to advance,\r\nthen retreated, not receiving any orders, and did not return to the\r\ncombat.\r\n\r\nThe column which came from the opposite side of the Tchernaia, and which\r\nGeneral Pavlov commanded, had in the meantime commenced its attack on\r\nthe other part of the English camp. Here were furious shocks and long\r\nalternations of success and defeat. Although the English right had been\r\njoined by their left, having got rid of the Karabelnaia column, the\r\ninequality of numbers was still great. The English had driven back the\r\nadvance guard of Pavlov’s column to the valley of the Tchernaia; but the\r\ngreater part of this column, supported by an immense artillery (nearly\r\none hundred guns) pushed forward its closely serried battalions with\r\nsuch violence that in the end they were masters of an earthwork, which\r\nprotected the right side of the English camp (a battery of sand bags).\r\n\r\nHad the Russians remained in this position, the allies would have lost\r\nthe day. Till then the English had made it their pride to keep up the\r\nstruggle without the help of the French. There was not a moment to lose;\r\ntwo of their generals were killed, several no longer able to fight; the\r\nsoldiers were exhausted. Lord Raglan called the French, who were awaiting\r\nthe signal.\r\n\r\nGeneral Bosquet, who commanded the corps nearest the English, sent out\r\nthe first two battalions he had at hand. It would have been too late if\r\nthe enemy had passed the fortification they had seized and had extended\r\nbeyond the isthmus. The Russians had been less active than brave. The\r\nFrench foot soldiers renewed the marvellous charge of the English cavalry\r\nat Balaklava. In their vehemence, they drove the greater number of the\r\nRussians far behind the battery of sand bags; they were repulsed in\r\ntheir turn by the mass of the enemy; but the movement of the latter had\r\nnevertheless been checked. The Russian leaders were not able to manœuvre\r\npromptly enough to place themselves, as they might have done, between the\r\nEnglish and the new reinforcements of French.\r\n\r\nThe French battalions arrived in double quick time with that agility\r\nalready shown at Alma by the soldier trained in African wars. The\r\nRussians repulsed a second attack; they succumbed under a third made\r\nwith more reinforcements. One of their regiments was precipitated by the\r\nFrench zouaves and turcos from the summit of the rocks into a deep ravine\r\nwhere it was shattered. The rest of the Russian troops made a slow and\r\npainful retreat under the terrible fire of the French artillery.\r\n\r\nThis sanguinary day cost the Russians twelve thousand men, killed,\r\nwounded, or missing. The English lost about twenty-six hundred men, the\r\nFrench seventeen to eighteen hundred. Beside their decisive intervention\r\non the plateau of Inkerman, the French troops had repulsed a sortie of\r\nthe garrison at Sebastopol.\r\n\r\nAccording to military historians, the check of the Russians was due,\r\nto a great extent, to their want of mobility and their incapacity for\r\nmanœuvring; the pedantic and circumstantial tactics imposed on them by\r\nNicholas only served to hinder them in presence of the enemy.\r\n\r\nThe allies, victorious, but suffering after such a victory, suspended the\r\nassault and decided to keep on the defensive until the arrival of new\r\nforces. They completed the circumvallation which protected the plateau\r\nof Chersonesus, from Inkerman to Balaklava; the Russians had retired\r\ncompletely; the French protected themselves on the town side by a line of\r\ncontravallation.[i]\r\n\r\nWhile the allies were occupied in digging trenches, laying mines, and\r\nincreasing the number of their batteries, the Russians, directed by\r\nthe able Tottleben, strengthened those defences of the city that were\r\nalready in existence and under the fire of the enemy erected new ones.\r\nThe allies, in spite of the sufferings incident to a severe winter,\r\nestablished themselves more and more securely, and on a strip of sandy\r\ncoast prepared to defy all the forces of the empire of the czar.\r\n\r\nOn the 26th of December, 1825, Nicholas had been consecrated by the blood\r\nof conspirators as the armed apostle of the principle of authority,\r\nthe destroying angel of counter-revolution. This was a part that he\r\nplayed not without glory for thirty years, having put down the Polish,\r\nHungarian, and Rumanian revolutions and prevented Prussia from yielding\r\nto the seductions of the German revolution. He had obstructed if not\r\ndestroyed the French Revolution in all its legal manifestations, the\r\nmonarchy of July, the republic, and the empire. He had saved the Austrian\r\nEmpire and prevented the creation of a democratic German empire. Like\r\nDon Quixote he was chivalrous, generous, disinterested, but represented\r\na superannuated principle that was out of place in the modern world. Day\r\nby day his character as chief of a chimerical alliance became more of\r\nan anachronism; particularly since 1848 aspirations of the people had\r\nbeen in direct contradiction to his theories of patriarchal despotism.\r\nIn Europe this contradiction had diminished the glory of the czar, but\r\nin Russia his authority remained unimpaired owing to his successes in\r\nTurkey, Persia, Caucasus, Poland, and Hungary. All complaints against\r\nthe police were forgotten as well as the restrictions laid on the press,\r\nand all efforts to control the government in matters of diplomacy, wars,\r\nand administration were relinquished; it was believed that the laborious\r\nmonarch would foresee everything and bring all affairs of state to a\r\nfortunate conclusion. Indeed the success of this policy was sufficient\r\nto silence the opposition offered by a few timid souls, and to furnish\r\njustification for blind confidence in the existing government.\r\n\r\nThe disasters in the East were a terrible awakening; invincible as the\r\nRussian fleet had hitherto been considered, it was obliged to take\r\nrefuge in its own ports or to be sunk in the harbour of Sebastopol.\r\nThe army had been conquered at Alma by the allies and at Silistria by\r\nthe despised Turks; a body of western troops fifty thousand strong was\r\ninsolently established before Sebastopol, and of the two former allies\r\nPrussia was neutral and Austria had turned traitor. The enforced silence\r\nof the press for the last thirty years had favoured the committal of\r\ndishonest acts by employés, the organisation of the army had been\r\ndestroyed by administrative corruption. Everything had been expected\r\nof the government, and now the Crimean War intervened and threatened\r\ncomplete bankruptcy to autocracy; absolute patriarchal monarchy was\r\nobliged to retreat before the Anglo-French invasion. The higher the\r\nhopes entertained for the conquest of Constantinople, the deliverance\r\nof Jerusalem and the extension of the Slavonic empire, the more cruel\r\nthe disappointment. At this moment a prodigious activity manifested\r\nitself throughout Russia, tongues were unloosed, and a great manuscript\r\nliterature was passed secretly from hand to hand, bringing audacious\r\naccusations against the government and all the hierarchy of officials:\r\n\r\n“Awake, O Russia!” exhorted one of these anonymous pamphlets; “awake from\r\nyour deep sleep of ignorance and apathy. Long enough we have been in\r\nbondage to the successors of the Tatar khans; rise to your full height\r\nbefore the throne of the despot and demand of him a reckoning for the\r\nnational disaster. Tell him plainly that his throne is not God’s altar\r\nand that God has not condemned our race to eternal slavery. Russia, O\r\nczar, had given into your hands the supreme power, and how have you\r\nexerted it? Blinded by ignorance and passion, you have sought power for\r\nits own sake and have forgotten the interests of the country. You have\r\nconsumed your life in reviewing troops, in altering uniforms, and in\r\nsigning your name to the legislative projects of ignorant charlatans.\r\nYou have created the detestable institution of press-censorship that you\r\nmight enjoy peace and remain in ignorance of the needs and complaints of\r\nyour people. You have buried Truth and rolled a great stone to the door\r\nof her sepulchre, and in the vanity of your heart you have exclaimed,\r\n‘For her there shall be no resurrection!’ Notwithstanding, Truth rose on\r\nthe third day and left the ranks of the dead. Czar, appear before the\r\ntribunal of history and of God! You have trodden truth under foot, and\r\nrefused to others liberty while you were yourself a slave to passion. By\r\nyour obstinacy and pride you have exhausted Russia and armed the rest\r\nof the world against her. Bow your haughty head to the dust and implore\r\nforgiveness, ask advice. Throw yourself upon the mercy of your people;\r\nwith them lies your only hope of safety!”[f]\r\n\r\n\r\nDEATH OF THE EMPEROR NICHOLAS I\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [1855 A.D.]]\r\n\r\nThe chivalrous soul of the Emperor Nicholas could not reconcile itself to\r\nthe complete wreck of all its political and spiritual ideals. Nicholas\r\nfell a sacrifice to his persistent pursuit of traditions bequeathed to\r\nhim by the Alexandrine policy of the last decade.\r\n\r\nOn the 2nd of March, 1855, Russia, and all European nations, were\r\ndismayed by the unexpected news of the sudden death of the emperor\r\nNicholas.[b] “Serve Russia!” were his last words to his son and heir. “I\r\nwished to overcome all national afflictions, to leave you a peaceful,\r\nwell-organized and happy empire.... Providence has ordained otherwise!”[j]\r\n\r\n\r\nSKRINE’S ESTIMATE OF NICHOLAS\r\n\r\nNicholas I died as grandly as he had lived, in the firm assurance that\r\nhe had done his duty. The nations of Europe watched him shining as a\r\npillar of fire amid the clouds of anarchy which beset the dawn of his\r\nreign. They stood aghast at his aggressions on Turkey and the relentless\r\nseverity with which he crushed the Polish and Hungarian rebellions. For\r\na generation he was the sword drawn against revolution. He saved Austria\r\nfrom dismemberment, and checked the premature creation of a democratic\r\nGerman Empire. Diplomatists styled him the “Don Quixote of politics”; and\r\nhis chivalrous spirit had much in common with that of Cervantes’ immortal\r\nhero. While he ruled his subjects with a rod of iron, he was ever ready\r\nto serve them with an unselfishness which has no parallel in history. But\r\nhis attempt to stereotype the existing order of things failed because it\r\ninfringed the law of nature which decrees that all organisms must advance\r\nor decay. As the nineteenth century wore on, bringing with it inventions\r\nwhich linked mankind in closer bonds and stimulated the exchange of\r\nthought, the czar of all the Russias became an anachronism.\r\n\r\nNicholas’s conceptions of his duties as a ruler were equally based on\r\nillusions. He strove to cut Russia adrift from Europe, to place her\r\nin quarantine against the contagion of western ideals. Here, again,\r\nhe essayed the impossible. Thought defied his custom’s barriers, his\r\ncensorship, his secret police; and Russia was already too deeply\r\nimpregnated with foreign influences to take the bias which the autocrat\r\nsought to give her energies. But, despite the calamities which it brought\r\non his people, Nicholas’s reaction served as a corrective to the cardinal\r\nvice of Peter the Great’s reforms--their tendency to denationalise. The\r\nworld saw in him a despot of the most unmitigated type. When the storm of\r\nhatred in which he went down to his grave had passed away, his bitterest\r\nfoes were fain to admit that he had given to all the peoples of his\r\nempire the germs of a sense of brotherhood, a robust faith in Russia,\r\nwhich is the surest guarantee of a splendid and prosperous future. Nor\r\nwere his subjects slow to recall his many admirable qualities. He was\r\nsteadfast and true, devoted to the Fatherland, inexorable to himself\r\neven more than to others. He despised feudalism and privileges--those\r\nquicksands which engulphed the French monarchy and threaten the existence\r\nof others as venerable. When Metternich took exception to the grant of\r\nthe highest Russian order to Field-Marshal Radetzki, on the score of the\r\nveteran’s humble origin, Nicholas replied that he valued a man, not for\r\nhis ancestors but solely for his deserts. In the private relations of\r\nlife--as a husband, father and friend, he shone with the serenest light,\r\nand conferred undying obligations on the empire. Before his reign men\r\nspoke of an imperial dynasty; they now allude to the house of Romanov as\r\na “family”; and the domestic joys in which succeeding czars have sought\r\nrelief from the cares of state find a counterpart in millions of Russian\r\nhomes.[k]\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES\r\n\r\n[68] [The Uniate is a part of the Greek church which has submitted to the\r\nsupremacy of the pope.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII. ALEXANDER II, THE CZAR LIBERATOR\r\n\r\n    In recalling to memory all that the Russian nation passed\r\n    through during the reign of the emperor Alexander II, and\r\n    comparing the position and condition of Russia at the end\r\n    of the reign with what they were in the beginning, it is\r\n    impossible not to marvel at the beneficent change which took\r\n    place throughout all the branches of national life during\r\n    that short space of time. The liberation of the peasants from\r\n    the dependence of serfdom, which had weighed on them for\r\n    some centuries, and the organisation of their existence, the\r\n    abolition of shameful and cruel corporal punishments, the\r\n    introduction of provincial and territorial institutions, of\r\n    the self-government of towns, the new tribunals and general\r\n    military service, without mentioning other less important\r\n    reforms, innovations and improvements accomplished by the\r\n    will of the Czar Liberator, had an immeasurable influence\r\n    upon the intellectual and moral regeneration of the people,\r\n    and, it may be said, gave to Russia a complete inward\r\n    revival.--SCHUMACHER.[d]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [1855-1881 A.D.]]\r\n\r\nBorn in 1818, Alexander came to power at the age of thirty-seven under\r\ncircumstances of the greatest difficulty both at home and abroad. “Your\r\nburden will be a heavy one,” his father had said to him when dying.\r\nAlexander’s first care was to terminate under honourable conditions the\r\nwar that was exhausting Russia. At the news of the death of Nicholas\r\nthe value of stocks and bonds rose in every exchange in Europe; and the\r\ngeneral peaceful mood was not disturbed by the new emperor’s proclamation\r\nthat he would “endeavour to carry out the views of his illustrious\r\npredecessors, Peter, Catherine, the beloved Alexander, and our father of\r\nimperishable memory.” A new conference took place at Vienna between the\r\nrepresentatives of Austria, Russia, and the two western powers. France\r\ndemanded the neutralisation of the Black Sea, or the limitation of\r\nthe naval powers that the czar might place there. “Before limiting our\r\nforces,” replied Gortchakov and Titov, the representatives of Russia,\r\n“take from us Sebastopol!”\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [1855 A.D.]]\r\n\r\nThe siege continued. Sardinia in its turn sent 20,000 men to the East.\r\nAustria agreed to defend the principalities against Russia, and Prussia\r\nagreed to support Austria. On the 16th of May Pélissier succeeded\r\nCanrobert as general-in-chief of the French forces. During the night\r\nof the 22nd of May the Russians made two sorties, which were repulsed;\r\nall the allied forces occupied the left bank of the Tchernaia, and an\r\nexpedition was sent out which destroyed the military posts of Kertch and\r\nJenikale, occupied the Sea of Azov, and bombarded Taganrog, leaving the\r\nRussians no route by which to receive supplies save that of Perekop. The\r\nTurks occupied Anapa and incited the Circassians to revolt.\r\n\r\nPélissier had announced that he would gain possession of Sebastopol, and\r\non the 7th of June he took by storm the Mamelon Vert (Green Hillock) and\r\nthe Ouvrages Blancs (White Works), on the 18th he sent the French to\r\nattack Malakov and the English to lay siege to the great Redan, but both\r\nexpeditions were repulsed with a loss of 3,000 men. On the 16th of August\r\nthe Italian contingent distinguished itself in the battle of Traktir on\r\nthe Tchernaia. The last day of Sebastopol had arrived. Eight hundred\r\nand seventy-four cannon directed their thunder against the bastions and\r\nthe city; and the Russians, who displayed a stoical intrepidity that\r\nnothing could shake, lost 18,000 men from the effects of the bombardment\r\nalone. A million and a half of projectiles were thrown upon the city. The\r\nFrench had dug 80 kilometres of trenches and sunk 1,251 metres of mines\r\nbefore the Mast bastion alone, and their parallels had been extended to\r\nwithin thirty metres of Malakov. Under a terrible fire, the noise of\r\nwhich could be heard at a distance of a hundred kilometres, the Russian\r\nbastions crumbled away, and their artillerists and reserve soldiers fell\r\nby thousands. Korinlov, Istomin, and Nakhimov succumbed. The besieged had\r\nnot even time to substitute good cannon for those that had been damaged,\r\nand could scarcely accomplish the burial of their dead. The very eve of\r\nthe crisis that was to end all had arrived.[b]\r\n\r\nDuring the protracted siege of Sebastopol death had claimed Marshal\r\nSaint-Arnaud; the French commander general Canrobert succeeded him and he\r\nwas now superseded by General Pélissier. Lord Raglan had fallen a victim\r\nto cholera, and General Simpson was now in command of the English army.\r\n\r\nIn these weary months of waiting there had been many sanguinary\r\nencounters both by day and by night, and repeated bombardments. But it\r\nwas not until September the 8th, 1855, that the grand assault was made.[a]\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FALL OF SEBASTOPOL\r\n\r\nAt half-past eleven in the morning (September 8) all the trenches before\r\nthe Karabel faubourg were occupied by the attacking force. Pélissier,\r\nsurrounded by his staff, was installed on the Green Mamelon. In the sixth\r\nparallel was Bosquet, attentive to everything and influencing everyone\r\naround him by his calm energy. The troops, excited, eager, with their\r\nclothes loosened so as to fight the better, filled beforehand with the\r\nrage of battle (for the long siege had tried their patience), impatiently\r\nawaited the signal. From time to time bayonets showed above the parapets.\r\n“Down with the bayonets,” shouted Bosquet, who feared to reveal to the\r\nenemy the position of the French: then he added more gently: “Have\r\npatience! the time will come.” It had as a fact almost come, being now\r\non the stroke of noon. “Forward!” cried Bosquet, and immediately his\r\ncolours as commandant were planted on the parallel. The order flew from\r\nmouth to mouth; drums beat, trumpets sounded; the officers with naked\r\nswords led their troops out of the trenches.\r\n\r\nThe Malakov garrison at that time was composed of 500 artillery, certain\r\nmilitiamen or workmen, and 1400 infantry belonging to the Modlin, Praga\r\nand Zamosc regiments. After being prepared for an attack at daybreak the\r\ngarrison was no longer upon the alert. Only the gunners remained by their\r\nguns, with a few riflemen along the ramparts. All the rest were hidden\r\nin their bomb-proof shelters and were about finishing their dinner.\r\nHaving become accustomed to alarms, they were resting at comparative\r\nease, and, yielding to that lassitude which often overtakes the mind\r\nand will after a night of anxious watching. They did not move except to\r\nsalute the commandant of the fort, General Bessau, who was making an\r\nexamination of the casemates and bestowing the cross of St. George on\r\nthe most deserving. Suddenly, on the stroke of noon, the sharp crack of\r\nthe French rifles rent the air, and the zouaves in their brilliantly\r\ncoloured uniforms were seen bounding up the Malakov slopes. “The French\r\nare upon us! We are attacked!” cried the guard. Before the defenders\r\nof the bastion had even had time to pick up their arms, the zouaves\r\nhad thrown themselves on the work. They cleared the fosse, and without\r\nwaiting for ladders scaled the escarp and precipitated themselves through\r\nthe embrasures. The Russian gunners stood to their guns, defending\r\nthemselves with stones, pickaxes, and sponges. Meantime the men of the\r\nModlin regiment rushed from their shelters and massed themselves towards\r\nthe front of the fort. There took place one of those hand-to-hand fights,\r\nso rare in the history of battles, a desperate, merciless fight, full of\r\nterrible episodes. But the Russians were hampered by their long cloaks;\r\nthe assailants, more active than they, dodged the blows of their enemies,\r\nsurrounded them, closed with them, and little by little gained ground.\r\nThe number of assailants momentarily increased. Immediately following the\r\nzouaves, almost side by side with them, appeared a battalion of the 7th\r\nline regiment, supporting the African troops with energy and bravery.\r\nGeneral Bessau fell, mortally wounded, nearly all the other Russian\r\nleading officers were killed. Pressed and outflanked on every side the\r\nbesieged fell back, surrendering the terre-plein, and retiring beyond the\r\nfirst traverses, and the colours of the 1st zouaves were hoisted on the\r\ncaptured redoubt. The battle had lasted only half an hour.\r\n\r\nDuring this same space of time Dulac’s division had invaded the Little\r\nRedan and driven back the riflemen as far as the second enceinte;\r\nwhilst La Motterouge’s division took possession of the curtain between\r\nthe Malakov and the Little Redan. From this post of observation the\r\ncommander-in-chief had seen the French eagle planted on the Malakov; he\r\nhad also witnessed the triumphant passage of Dulac’s and La Motterouge’s\r\ndivisions. Immediately he hoisted the queen’s colours on the Green\r\nMamelon. This was the signal for which the English were waiting.\r\n\r\nAt the sight of it they poured out of their trenches; with the intrepid\r\ncoolness characteristic of their temperament and their country. First\r\ncame their rifles, next the men with scaling ladders, then the attacking\r\ncolumns composed of the light division and the 2nd division. In making\r\ntheir attack our allies were at a double disadvantage; in the first place\r\nthe Russians were on the alert throughout the length of their line of\r\ndefence, and, secondly, a distance of 200 yards lay between them and the\r\nGreat Redan. A murderous fire greeted them, and before they could reach\r\nthe work the ground was strewn with their red coats. They continued to\r\nadvance notwithstanding, doubled to the fosse, scaled it, drew up their\r\nladders, reached the now almost demolished salient-angle and routed the\r\nbattalions of the Vladimir regiment. Before them stretched a great space,\r\nopen and exposed; beyond it were the bomb-proof shelters from which\r\nthe Russians kept up their hottest and best directed fire. Vainly the\r\nattacking party strove to push their undertaking further: vainly even did\r\nthey strain every nerve to maintain the ground they had gained. After an\r\nhour and a half of futile attempts they fell back on their trenches.\r\n\r\nWhilst the English were being foiled at the Great Redan, Levaillant’s\r\ndivision approached the central bastion at about two o’clock and met\r\nwith no better fate. At first Couston’s brigade succeeded in getting\r\npossession of the Schwartz redoubt, to the left of the bastion; it even\r\nfought a battle in the gully known as the Town Gully. But the commanding\r\nofficer was wounded, reinforcements arrived for the enemy, and it was\r\nbrought back to the foremost parallels. To the right of the bastion\r\nTrocher’s brigade had invaded the Bielkine lunette and gained the bastion\r\nitself, but could no longer maintain its advantage. Like General Couston,\r\nGeneral Trocher was wounded, and the Russian reprisals shattered his\r\nunhappy regiments. A second attempt was not more happy, and orders came\r\nfrom the commander-in-chief forbidding a continuance of such bloody\r\nefforts.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ALEXANDER II\r\n\r\n(1818-1881)]\r\n\r\nAnd indeed where was the use of persisting against the town when the\r\nprincipal engagement had been fought in the Karabel faubourg, an\r\nengagement which, according to whether it succeeded or failed, would save\r\nor compromise everything else?\r\n\r\nAt the Little Redan fortune had made the French columns pay dearly for\r\ntheir early success. Barely mistress of the bastion, Dulac’s division had\r\nbeen assailed by a heavy fire from the batteries of the _Maison-en-Croix_\r\nand of the three vessels moored in the roads. Moreover the Russians had\r\nbrought up a large number of field-pieces to all the more favourable\r\npoints, whilst a considerable number of reserve troops debouched from the\r\nUchakov gully. Outnumbered; crushed by showers of missiles, and finally\r\ncompelled to evacuate a redoubt filled with their dead, our troops had\r\nretired to their place-of-arms. At the curtain La Motterouge’s division\r\nhad itself given way before the attacks of the enemy. New columns were\r\nformed from the débris of Saint-Pol’s brigade, which had already lost its\r\ngeneral, de Marolles’ brigade, and the guards division. A little later\r\narrived at full gallop two batteries of the Lancaster artillery which, by\r\nthe hotness of their fire, strove to work havoc in the enemy’s columns,\r\nand, above all, to disperse the fog. The Little Redan was taken, lost,\r\nretaken, abandoned. The bloodshed was terrific. General de Marolles was\r\nkilled, Generals Bourbaki, Bisson, Mellinet and de Pontevès wounded,\r\nthe latter mortally; the trenches were so heaped with dead that it was\r\nalmost impossible to move in them. Atop of all this General Bosquet was\r\nwounded in the right side by the bursting of a shell. He was obliged to\r\nrelinquish his command, and a rumour even got about that he was dying.\r\nShortly after a loud report was heard from the direction of the curtain.\r\nA powder-magazine had exploded, claiming fresh victims; General de la\r\nMotterouge was among the wounded. So many casualties, the loss of so many\r\nofficers, the difficulty of fighting in a narrow space choked up with\r\ndead and dying, even extreme exhaustion, all combined to dissuade from\r\na renewed attack on the Little Redan. Only a portion of La Motterouge’s\r\ndivision partially held its own on the ramparts.\r\n\r\nIt was now three o’clock. Judging only by the results as a whole the\r\nallies had to count more disappointments than successes. The English\r\nhad been beaten back at the Great Redan. The central bastion withstood\r\nall attacks. And finally, in the Karabel faubourg the Little Redan,\r\nalready carried, had just slipped from our grasp. But, notwithstanding,\r\nthere was more joy than depression amongst those surrounding the\r\ncommander-in-chief. All eyes were turned obstinately towards the Malakov.\r\nWere the Malakov safely held, not only would the other checks be made\r\ngood but the advantage of the day would rest with the allied army;\r\nfor the occupation of this dominant position would render all further\r\nresistance impossible. Now, according to all accounts MacMahon was\r\nkeeping safe hold of his prize and strengthening himself there.\r\n\r\nHe had maintained his position, God only knows at what cost of valour. We\r\nhave related how the terre-plein fell into the hands of the allies, and\r\nhow this brilliant success had determined the great attack. But inside\r\nthe work, fortified and improved with so much care during the long days\r\nof siege, the Russians had thrown up a multitude of traverses beneath\r\nwhich were their bomb-proof shelters, which formed all over the fort\r\nso many trenches easy of defence. The salient-angle once occupied, it\r\nwould be necessary to carry one by one these traverses behind which were\r\ndrawn up what remained of the Modlin regiment and the Praga and Zamosc\r\nbattalions. Happily General MacMahon had recalled the 2nd, Vinoy’s,\r\ndivision. Thanks to these reinforcements he had been enabled to force\r\nback the enemy, dislodge them from their positions and drive them towards\r\nthe gorge of the redoubt.\r\n\r\nThere an engagement had taken place more terrible than any throughout the\r\nday. Driven to bay at the extremity of the work, the Russians had, by\r\na series of heroic rushes, attempted to retake the fort, the veritable\r\npalladium of their city. Whilst MacMahon hastily ordered up Wimpfen’s\r\nbrigade, and the zouaves of the guard, in short all the reserves, the\r\nMuscovite officers sacrificed themselves one after the other in their\r\nefforts to avert a total defeat. First it was General Lisenko with a few\r\nremnants of the Warsaw, Briansk and Ieletz regiments; then General Krulov\r\nwith four battalions of the Ladoga regiment, lastly General Iuverov\r\nwith the same men newly led on to battle. Lisenko was mortally wounded,\r\nKrulov dangerously so, Iuverov killed. In the end the Malakov gorge was\r\nours. The engineers began at once to put it in a state of defence: the\r\ncapitulation of the little garrison of the tower, isolated in the midst\r\nof the fort, completed the victory. A supreme effort made a little later\r\nby General de Martinau with the Azov and Odessa regiments only served to\r\ndemonstrate the powerlessness of our enemies to wrest the magnificent\r\nprize from us.\r\n\r\nAnd magnificent it certainly was. The corpses heaped around the fortress\r\nshowed plainly enough the Russians’ obstinate intention to defend or\r\nrecapture it. Notwithstanding the fact that our triumph was complete the\r\nfusilade had not ceased. There were still certain volunteers risking\r\ntheir lives around the Mamelon, meditating some desperate stroke. “Give\r\nus cartridges,” they cried: “Let someone lead us again to battle.” But\r\nnearly all their officers were either dead or in the ambulances, and\r\nthe remainder scarcely troubled to answer them. Not that they were\r\nindifferent to so crushing a defeat, but after such desperate fighting an\r\nimmense weariness had overtaken them, and, having done all they could to\r\navert their fate they now submitted to it impassively.\r\n\r\nTowards four o’clock Prince Gortchakov arrived on these scenes of\r\nconfusion and woe. On receiving the first intelligence of the assault\r\nhe had crossed the roads and had been able to follow all the varying\r\nchances of the fight. For a long time he surveyed the Karabelnaia, as if\r\nto gauge the defensive strength of the faubourg; for a yet longer time\r\nhe contemplated the Malakov, so lately the pride of the Russians and\r\nnow lost to them. Neither the still hot firing which killed one of his\r\nofficers at his side, nor the time which pressed availed to cut short\r\nthis searching examination.\r\n\r\nAt last, judging that the town was no longer tenable he decided on\r\nconsummating the sacrifice. The moment seemed to him a favourable one,\r\nfor two reasons: the success gained at the Great and Little Redans\r\nand at the safeguarded central bastion, had established the honour\r\nof the Muscovite arms; whereas the extreme weariness of the allies\r\nguaranteed that the remainder of the day and the ensuing night would be\r\nallowed by them to pass without further offensive action. The Russian\r\ncommander-in-chief therefore resolved to evacuate Sebastopol and to make\r\nall his troops cross over to the northern bank. The idea once conceived\r\nhe hurried to the Nicholas battery to secure the immediate execution of\r\nhis orders.\r\n\r\nAt his post of observation on the Green Mamelon, Pélissier had learnt\r\nof MacMahon’s signal success, and this great advantage, somewhat\r\ncounterbalanced it is true by the checks received in other engagements,\r\nfilled all hearts with hope. Nevertheless, by reason of this multitude of\r\nengagements, victory appeared to be, though probable, still uncertain.\r\nWould MacMahon be able to maintain his position at the Malakov? Might not\r\nsome exploding mine change the triumph into a catastrophe? Would not the\r\ndefeated Russians defend themselves from behind their second enceinte,\r\nin their streets, in their houses even? And would not the battle of\r\nSeptember 8 have a yet more bloody morrow? No answer was forthcoming to\r\nthese questions, and faces that had begun to brighten grew troubled.\r\n\r\nThings were at this stage when, towards the end of the day, General\r\nMartimprey turning his glasses towards the town thought he detected an\r\nunaccustomed movement on the great bridge spanning the roads. Glasses\r\nwere passed from hand to hand and, despite the first shades of evening,\r\nlong processions of soldiers, waggons, carriages, guns, could be\r\ndistinctly seen wending their way towards the northern bank. The bridge\r\ngave under the weight, and shaken by a high wind swayed beneath the swell\r\nwhich from time to time submerged and almost swamped it. In spite of this\r\nhindrance the march continued, whilst ferry-boats filled with people\r\ncrossed to the northern bank, and then returned empty to fetch other\r\npassengers. The rapidly falling darkness prevented further observation,\r\nbut the spectators felt no doubt that they were watching the retreat of\r\nthe Russians.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PRINCE A. M. GORTCHAKOV\r\n\r\n(1798-1883)]\r\n\r\nThey had not all retreated, however. At this supreme moment Gortchakov\r\nbethought himself of Moscow. Several volunteer corps and several\r\ndetachments of sappers and marines were left behind, not to give battle\r\nto an already victorious enemy, but to level to the dust the city it\r\nwas no longer possible to defend. As night fell the work of devastation\r\nwas begun. Powder-magazines were blown up. The cannon and siege trains\r\nthat could not be removed were sunk in the bay. All that remained of the\r\nNorth Sea squadron was sunk; even the _Empress Marie_ was not spared,\r\nthat splendid vessel which was commanded by the glorious Nahkimov at\r\nthe battle of Sinope. Only the war steamers were saved and taken across\r\nto the northern bank. The blowing up of the Paul battery completed the\r\nwork of destruction. When all was finished the great bridge was broken\r\nup. Then the executors of those savage orders departed in boats for the\r\nfurther shore. With them went the generals who up to that moment had\r\nremained at Sebastopol to guard the retreat. Of this number was Count\r\nOsten-Sacken, governor of the town, who was one of the last to leave, as\r\na captain abandons his burning ship only when all the hands have left.\r\n\r\nThe explosions of that terrible night had kept the allies on the alert\r\nin their camp, and had triumphed over their immense fatigue. At daybreak\r\non the 9th of September, Sebastopol, already nearly deserted, appeared\r\nto them as an immense heap of ruins from which shot up tongues of\r\nflame kindled by the incendiaries. For a long time French and English\r\ncontemplated with a mixture of joy and horror those ruins which attested\r\nthe greatness of their triumph and also the tenacity of their enemies.\r\nBeyond the roadstead, on the northern heights, appeared the Russians,\r\nvanquished but still menacing.\r\n\r\nOn the morrow, September 10th, 1855--after 332 days of siege, three set\r\nbattles, and three assaults more bloody even than the battles--Pélissier,\r\nas marshal of France, in the name of the emperor, planted his country’s\r\nflag among the smoking ruins.[e]\r\n\r\nWith the fall of Sebastopol the war was practically at an end.\r\nHostilities continued for some time longer, but neither side won any\r\nmaterial advantage. The allies were not in complete accord on the\r\nquestion of the continuance of the war, England being inclined to push\r\nmatters to a complete overthrow of Russia, while France was ready to talk\r\nabout terms of peace. Lord Palmerston himself was a strenuous opponent\r\nof peace, and declared that Russia had not been sufficiently humbled. At\r\nthis juncture Prince A. M. Gortchakov, the Russian ambassador at Vienna,\r\ntaking advantage of the divided councils of the allies, urged Austria to\r\nact as peacemaker. The emperor Francis Joseph thereupon took the occasion\r\nto press upon Russia an acceptance of the four conditions on which Turkey\r\nwas prepared to make peace, backing the communication with an implied\r\nthreat of war in case of denial. On January 16th, 1856, the czar, much\r\nagainst his will, signified his acceptance of Austrian intervention. The\r\npreliminaries of peace were signed on February 1st and on the 25th of\r\nthe same month representatives of the great powers assembled at Paris\r\nto settle the details of the peace. Negotiations proceeded for over a\r\nmonth, France and Russia drawing together and Austria insisting upon the\r\nmaximum of Russian cessions.[a]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [1856 A.D.]]\r\n\r\nUnder the Treaty of Paris, March 30th, 1856, the powers bound themselves\r\nnot to intervene singly in the administration of Turkey, to respect her\r\nindependence and territorial status, and to treat disputes between any\r\nof them and the Porte as matters of general interest. A Hatti-sherif,\r\nor ordinance, had been obtained by England from the sultan before the\r\ncongress opened, which guaranteed equal religious privileges to all\r\nhis subjects. This was set forth as an article in the treaty. Russia\r\nrenounced her claims to a protectorate over Turkish Christians. She\r\nabandoned similar pretensions with regard to the Danubian principalities,\r\nwhich were in future to be governed by hospodars elected under European\r\ncontrol. She surrendered to Moldavia the southern portion of Bessarabia,\r\nwhich had been ceded under the Treaty of Bucharest, retaining however\r\nthe principal trade-routes southwards and the fortress of Khotin. The\r\nnavigation of the Danube was declared free to all nations, and placed\r\nunder an European commission.\r\n\r\nA clause, through which Russia drew her pen as soon as an opportunity\r\npresented itself, declared the Black Sea neutral and closed it to\r\nmen-of-war of all nations. Russia surrendered Kars to Turkey, but\r\nregained the portion of the Crimea in the allies’ occupation. By a\r\nseparate act she undertook not to fortify the Åland Isles or to make them\r\na naval station. Thanks to the astuteness of her diplomacy, she scored\r\na decided success against England in securing the insertion of articles\r\nwhich limited the scope of naval warfare. The Treaty of Paris abolished\r\nprivateering, and provided that a neutral flag should protect the enemy’s\r\ngoods, while neutral property, even under a hostile flag, was exempted\r\nfrom capture. “Contraband of war” was indeed excepted, but no attempt was\r\nmade to define the meaning of this ambiguous phrase. The recognition of a\r\nblockade by neutrals was to be conditional on its effectiveness.[g]\r\n\r\n\r\nAMELIORATION IN THE CONDITION OF THE SOLDIER\r\n\r\nOn the 26th of August, 1856, the emperor Alexander Nikolaivitch placed\r\non his head, in the cathedral of the Assumption at Moscow, the imperial\r\ncrown and received the sacrament of anointing with the Holy Chrism.\r\nThe sacred day of the coronation was one of rejoicing and hitherto\r\nunprecedented favours and therefore left the most joyful remembrance in\r\nthe hearts of the people.\r\n\r\nWhen he had taken upon himself the imperial crown, the emperor Alexander\r\nII immediately set about the preparation of those great administrative\r\nreforms, which were so full of humanity and justice, which made his reign\r\nillustrious and which immortalised his name.\r\n\r\nSolicitous for the welfare of his people, the emperor first of all\r\ndirected his attention to the improvement of the condition of the\r\nsoldier and entered upon a series of reforms in the organisation and\r\nadministration of that army, which was so dear to his heart, with the\r\nobject of raising the moral spirit of the troops, of arousing the lower\r\nranks to the consciousness of their dignity and in general of placing the\r\nmilitary profession upon its proper elevated footing.\r\n\r\nAs the preserver of order in the state during times of peace and the\r\ndefender of the country in time of war, the soldier is justly proud of\r\nhis profession; he should not be given cause for mortification by finding\r\nbeside him in the service men condemned to the ranks as punishment for\r\nvicious behaviour. Yet in previous times men were frequently made\r\nsoldiers by way of punishment for some crime instead of being banished\r\nto the settlements: fugitives, vagabonds, horse stealers, thieves,\r\nswindlers, and such vicious persons found a place in the ranks of the\r\narmy.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [1860 A.D.]]\r\n\r\nThe emperor Alexander II put an end to this shameful state of things: by\r\nthe imperial manifesto of 1860 the enrolment of soldiers as a punishment\r\nfor crimes and offences, an abuse which had attained vast dimensions,\r\nwas abolished and replaced by other forms of punishment. But the czar’s\r\nchief care was to bring to fulfilment his most sacred idea, one which\r\nhe cherished day and night: to give liberty to the peasants who were\r\ndependent as serfs upon the landowners; to abolish the law of serfdom.\r\nAmongst the great administrative reforms accomplished during the reign\r\nof the emperor Alexander II, the liberation of the peasants occupies\r\nincontestably the first place and served as the chief foundation for\r\nall the reforms that followed. All further changes were directly or\r\nindirectly called forth by the abolition of the law of serfdom. This\r\nglorious accomplishment which gave new life to Russia, which breathed a\r\nnew soul into the millions of Russian peasantry, was the most important\r\nof all the great deeds of the emperor Alexander II, and the brightest\r\njewel in the crown of his glory.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE EMANCIPATION OF THE SERFS (1861 A.D.)\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [1861 A.D.]]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A PEASANT COSTUME]\r\n\r\nThe predecessors of Alexander II had already felt all the evils of\r\nthe law of serfdom and had not unfrequently aimed, if not directly at\r\nits abolition, at least at the amelioration of the position of the\r\npeasant serfs and their gradual preservation against the arbitrariness\r\nof the landowners’ authority. But all these beneficent measures were\r\ninsufficient for the abolition of the firmly established order; they\r\nonly limited the rights of serfdom, put a certain restraint upon it, but\r\ndid not abolish the right of the possession of serfs. The glory of the\r\ncomplete emancipation of the peasants from the dependency of serfdom,\r\nthe great and difficult initiative of the entire abolition of the law of\r\nserfdom in Russia belongs wholly to the emperor Alexander II.\r\n\r\nThe question of the abolition of the law of serfdom constituted the chief\r\ncare of the emperor Alexander II during the first years of his reign;\r\nall the course of the work in connection with the matter of the peasants\r\ntestified to what firmness of will, immovable convictions and persistency\r\nwere brought by the emperor himself into this matter which he regarded\r\nas “sacred and most vital” for Russia.\r\n\r\nThe emperor spoke many times in public on the peasant question during\r\nthe time when the measure was under discussion. The sovereign’s speeches\r\nall displayed his firm, inflexible intention of bringing the work he had\r\nconceived to a successful termination; they had kept up the courage of\r\nthose labouring for the peasantry reforms, attracted the wavering, kept\r\nopponents in check, and thus had an enormous influence both on public\r\nopinion and on the course of local and general work in the matter of\r\npeasant reforms.\r\n\r\nThe solution of the peasant question, which was of such vital importance\r\nto Russia, presented many difficulties. Of course it would have been far\r\neasier to master the problem if the emperor had desired to solve it as\r\nit had already been solved in some kingdoms of western Europe, where the\r\npeasants had been at one time in the same position as the Russian serfs;\r\nthere the peasants had only been declared individually free, the land\r\nremained the property of the landowner. But such was not the will of the\r\nemperor Alexander II. He desired that the interests of the landlords\r\nshould be as far as possible guarded, and also that the emancipated\r\npeasants should be endowed with a fixed quantity of land; not converted\r\ninto homeless, landless labourers.\r\n\r\nMuch labour had to be expended over this great problem before an issue\r\nwas found for its successful solution. The chief executor of the\r\nemperor’s preconceived plans in the matter of the peasant question was\r\nAdjutant-General J. T. Rostovtsev, in whom Alexander found an enlightened\r\nand boundlessly devoted assistant. In his turn Rostovtsev found a most\r\nzealous and talented collaborator in the person of N. A. Milutin, who\r\nwarmly took up the cause of the emancipation of the peasants and who,\r\nafter the death of Rostovtsev in 1860, became the chief director of all\r\nthe work upon this question. The emperor attentively followed the course\r\nof the preparatory labours on the peasant reforms and without giving any\r\nserious heed to the wiles and opposition of the obstinate partisans of\r\nthe law of serfdom, he firmly and unwaveringly directed these labours to\r\nthe object marked out.\r\n\r\nBut of course it was impossible to accomplish so vast a work at once.\r\nFour years passed in the indispensable preparatory work. The thoughts of\r\nthe sovereign were full of this administrative measure; his heart must\r\nhave been frequently overwhelmed with anxieties and fears in regard to\r\nthe successful solution of the peasant question. But the czar’s will\r\nnever weakened, his love for his people was never exhausted, and the\r\ngreat, holy work of the emancipation of the rural population of Russia\r\nfrom the bondage of serfdom, and the organisation of this population into\r\na new form of existence was at last brought to a successful conclusion.\r\n\r\nOn the 19th of February, 1861, in the sixth year of the reign of the\r\nemperor Alexander II, all doubts were resolved. On that memorable day,\r\nwhich can never be forgotten in Russia, was accomplished the greatest\r\nevent in the destinies of the Russian people: the emperor Alexander II,\r\nafter having fervently prayed in solitude, signed the imperial manifesto\r\nfor the abolition of the right of serfdom over the peasants living on\r\nthe landlords’ estates and for granting to these peasants the rights\r\nof a free agricultural status. Through the initiative and persistent\r\nefforts of their czar more than twenty-two million Russian peasants were\r\nliberated from the burden of serfdom, which had weighed on them and their\r\nforebears for nearly three centuries. They obtained their freedom and\r\ntogether with it the possibility of enjoying the fruits of their free\r\nlabour, that is, of working for themselves, for their own profit and\r\nadvantage and of governing themselves and their actions according to\r\ntheir own will and discernment. Freedom was given to the Russian peasant\r\nby the emperor Alexander II himself; it was not given under him, but\r\nby him; he personally maintained the right of his people to freedom,\r\npersonally broke the chains of serfdom; the initiative of this great\r\nwork, its direction and its execution belong wholly to the emperor.\r\nWe repeat, the laws of serfdom crumbled away at his royal word alone.\r\nTogether with the imperial manifesto of the 19th of February, 1861, were\r\npromulgated in both capitals and afterwards throughout all Russia, laws\r\nfor the organization of the liberated peasants into the social order,\r\nentitled “General regulations concerning the peasants issuing from the\r\ndependence of serfdom.” Upon the basis of these laws and in particular\r\nby virtue of the reforms that followed, the liberated peasants were thus\r\ngranted personal, social, and individual rights which placed them almost\r\non a footing of equality with the other classes of the state.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Laws and Social Rights Granted to the Peasants_\r\n\r\nIn conferring upon the liberated peasants the individual rights,\r\ncommon to all citizens of the empire, the czar was solicitous for the\r\nestablishment of laws actually conducive to the security and amelioration\r\nof their condition, indissolubly bound up as it had been with the use and\r\nenjoyment of the land. With this object in view it was established that\r\nthe peasant should have a share in the perpetual enjoyment of the farm\r\nsettlements and arable land, in accordance with the qualities of the land\r\nof each locality and with local requirements. But as the peasants had not\r\nmeans to give the landowner at once all the value due for their share\r\nof the land, and on the other hand as the prospect of receiving the sum\r\nallotted, in small proportions during a period of thirty to forty years,\r\nwas not an alluring one for the landowner, the state took upon itself the\r\noffice of intermediary between the landowners and the liberated peasants\r\nand paid the landowner in redeemable paper all the sums due to him and\r\ninscribed them as long term debts against the peasants, who were under\r\nthe obligation of paying them off by yearly instalments.\r\n\r\nTogether with the reservation of individual and property rights to the\r\nemancipated peasants, a special peasant government was established\r\nfor them. The peasants received the right of disposing independently\r\nof their agricultural and public work, and of choosing from amongst\r\nthemselves the wisest and most reliable persons for conducting their\r\naffairs under the direction of peasant assemblies. And as in the life of\r\nthe Russian peasants many ancient customs and rules are preserved which\r\nare esteemed and observed as sacred, being the product of the experience\r\nof their forefathers, the emperor granted them also their own district\r\npeasant tribunals which decide upon purely local questions and arbitrate\r\naccording to the conscience and traditions of these communities.\r\n\r\nThe imperial manifesto was, as has already been said, signed on the\r\n19th of February, 1861, but it was universally proclaimed only on the\r\n5th of March of the same year; the news of the emancipation evoked an\r\nindescribable enthusiasm, a touching gratitude in the people towards\r\ntheir liberator throughout the whole length of the Russian land,\r\nbeginning with the capital and finishing with the last poor little\r\nhamlet.[d]\r\n\r\nHaving thus summarised the results achieved by this remarkable manifesto,\r\nwe give below a literal translation of the full text of the document\r\nitself.[a]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Text of the Imperial Proclamation_\r\n\r\n               Manifesto of the Emancipation of the Serfs:\r\n                           By the Grace of God\r\n                        We, Alexander the Second,\r\n                           Emperor and Autocrat\r\n                           Of All the Russias,\r\n                  King of Poland, Grand Duke of Finland,\r\n                     et cætera, et cætera, et cætera,\r\n                 Make known to all Our faithful subjects.\r\n\r\nHaving been called by God’s Providence and the sacred law of succession\r\nto the throne of our forefathers and All the Russias, We have in\r\naccordance with this calling vowed to comprehend in Our royal love and\r\ncare all Our faithful subjects of every calling and condition, from him\r\nwho nobly wields the sword in the defence of the fatherland to the modest\r\nworker with the tools of the artisan, from him who serves in the highest\r\nservice of the state to him who draws the furrow over the field with the\r\nplough.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A STREET VENDER]\r\n\r\nUpon examining into the position of the various callings and conditions\r\nof the state structure, We have observed that the legislation of the\r\nstate, while organising actively and well the higher and middle classes\r\nby determining their duties, rights and privileges, has not attained to\r\nan equal activity in regard to the people bound to the soil and called\r\nserfs because they, partly through ancient laws, partly from custom, are\r\nhereditarily settled under the authority of the landowners, upon whom\r\nat the same time the obligation lies to provide for their welfare. The\r\nrights of the landowners have been until now extensive and not defined\r\nwith any exactitude by the law, the place of which has been taken instead\r\nby tradition, custom and the good will of the landowner. In the most\r\nfavourable cases there have proceeded from this state of things kind,\r\npatriarchal relations of sincere and true guardianship and beneficence\r\non the part of the landlord, and good tempered obedience on the part of\r\nthe peasant. But with the increasing complexity of manners and customs,\r\nwith the increasing diversity of relations, the lessening of direct\r\nintercourse between the landowners and peasants, the occasional falling\r\nof the landowner’s rights into the hands of persons who only seek their\r\nown profit, these good relations have weakened, and a path has been\r\nopened for an arbitrariness which is burdensome to the peasants and\r\nunfavourable to their welfare, and to which the peasants have responded\r\nby insensibility to improvement in their own existence.\r\n\r\nThese matters were observed also by Our ever to be remembered\r\npredecessors and they took measures to effect a change for the better in\r\nthe position of the peasants; but these measures were indecisive. In many\r\ncases they depended on the co-operation of the landowners; in others they\r\nconcerned only particular localities and were instituted to meet special\r\nrequirements or else as experiments. Thus the emperor Alexander I issued\r\na regulation concerning the freedom of agriculturists, and Our deceased\r\nparent Nicholas I, who rests in God, a regulation as to the obligations\r\nof peasants. In the western governments inventory rules have defined the\r\ndistribution of the peasants by the land and their obligations. But the\r\nregulations concerning the freedom of agriculturists and the obligations\r\nof peasants have been carried out only to a very limited extent.\r\n\r\nThus, We have become convinced that the amelioration of the condition\r\nof the serfs or people bound to the soil, is for us a testament of\r\nOur predecessors and a lot appointed to Us, through the course of\r\ncircumstances, by the hand of Providence.\r\n\r\nWe have entered upon this work by an act showing Our confidence in the\r\nRussian nobility, Our confidence in their devotion to the throne, which\r\nhas been proved by great trials, and in their readiness to make large\r\nsacrifices for the good of the country. We left the nobility, at its own\r\nrequest, responsible for the new legislation in behalf of the peasantry.\r\nIt thus became the duty of the nobles to limit their rights over the\r\npeasants and to take up the difficulties of the reformation; and this\r\ninvolved a sacrifice of their own interests. But Our confidence has been\r\njustified. In the government committees, invested with the confidence of\r\nthe nobility of each government, the nobility has voluntarily renounced\r\nits rights over the persons of the serfs. In these committees when the\r\nnecessary information had been collected, propositions were drawn up for\r\nthe new code regulating the conditions of persons bound to the soil, and\r\ntheir relations to the landowners.\r\n\r\nThese propositions, which, as might have been expected from the nature\r\nof the matter, were very various, have been compared, brought into\r\nharmony, arranged in a regular form, amended and completed in the higher\r\ncommission appointed for this matter; and the new propositions thus\r\nconstituted in the interests of landowners, peasants, and menials have\r\nbeen examined in the council of state.\r\n\r\nCalling upon God to assist us, We have decided to bring this work to its\r\naccomplishment.\r\n\r\nIn virtue of the new regulations, the serfs will receive at the proper\r\ntime the full rights of free villagers.\r\n\r\nThe landowners while preserving the rights of property over all the\r\nland belonging to them, will leave the peasants, in return for the dues\r\nestablished, in perpetual enjoyment of their farm settlements; Moreover,\r\nin order to ensure the security of their existence and the fulfilment of\r\ntheir obligations before the Government, the quantity of arable land and\r\nother necessaries allotted will be determined by regulation.\r\n\r\nThus profiting by a share of the land, the peasants are in return obliged\r\nto pay in to the landowner certain dues determined by the regulations.\r\nIn this condition which is transitory the peasants are denominated as\r\ntemporarily bound to work for the landlords.\r\n\r\nTogether with this they are given the right to buy their farm\r\nsettlements, and with the consent of the landlords they can acquire\r\nas property the arable land and other appendages, allotted for their\r\nperpetual enjoyment. By such acquisitions of certain determined\r\nquantities of land, the peasants are freed from any obligations to the\r\nlandowners on the land purchased and enter into the position of free\r\npeasant-proprietors.\r\n\r\nBy special regulation in regard to menials or domestic servants, a\r\ntransitory position is determined for them adapted to their occupations\r\nand requirements; after the expiration of a space of two years from the\r\nday of the issue of this regulation, they will receive full emancipation\r\nand exemption from taxes.\r\n\r\nThese are the chief principles by which are determined the future\r\norganisation of the peasants and the menials. They indicate in detail the\r\nrights granted to the peasants and menials and the duties laid upon them\r\nin respect to the government and the landlords.\r\n\r\nAlthough these regulations, general, local and special as well as\r\nsupplementary rules for certain particular localities, for the estates\r\nof small landed proprietors, and for peasants working in their\r\nlandlords’ manufactories are as far as possible adapted to the economic\r\nrequirements, yet in order to preserve the usual order, We leave to the\r\nlandlords the option of making a voluntary agreement with the peasants\r\nregarding land and dues.\r\n\r\nAs the new system, on account of the inevitable multitude of changes it\r\ninvolves, cannot be at once introduced, but requires time for adjustment,\r\ntherefore in order to avoid disturbance in public and private affairs,\r\nthe order existing until now shall be preserved for two years, when,\r\nafter the completion of the necessary preparations, the new laws shall go\r\ninto force.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A WOMAN OF KAMCHATKA]\r\n\r\nFor the lawful attainment of this, We have considered it well to command\r\nthat:\r\n\r\n1. In every government a government council on peasant affairs shall\r\nbe opened, having the supreme direction of the affairs of the peasant\r\nsocieties installed on the landowners’ territories.\r\n\r\n2. Arbiters of peace are to be nominated in the districts, and district\r\nassemblies formed from them in order to investigate on the spot into any\r\nmisunderstandings and disputes which may arise in the fulfilment of the\r\nregulations.\r\n\r\n3. Besides this, communal councils are to be established on the\r\nlandowners’ estates, in order that, while leaving the village communities\r\nin their present formation, _Volost_[69] councils should be opened in the\r\nprincipal villages, uniting the smaller village communities under one\r\n_Volost_ administration.\r\n\r\n4. A charter shall be drawn up in each village specifying, on the\r\nbasis of the local regulations, the quantity of land appointed for\r\nthe perpetual enjoyment of the peasants, and the dues to be paid the\r\nlandowner.\r\n\r\n5. These charters shall be executive, and brought into operation within a\r\nspace of two years from the day of the issue of this manifesto.\r\n\r\n6. Until the expiration of this term, the peasants and menials are to\r\nremain in their previous condition of subjection to the landlords and\r\nindisputably to fulfil their former obligations.\r\n\r\n7. The landowners are to see that order is maintained on their estates,\r\nand preserve the right of the dispensation of justice until the formation\r\nand opening of the _Volost_ tribunals.\r\n\r\nIn contemplating the inevitable difficulties of the reform, We first\r\nof all lay Our trust in God’s most gracious Providence, which protects\r\nRussia.\r\n\r\nAfter this We rely on the valiant zeal of the Honourable body of the\r\nNobility, to whom We cannot but testify the gratitude it has earned\r\nfrom Us and from the whole country for its disinterested action in the\r\nrealisation of Our preconceived plans. Russia will not forget that it has\r\nvoluntarily, incited only by respect for the dignity of man and Christian\r\nlove for its neighbour, renounced serfdom and laid the foundation of the\r\nnew agricultural future of the peasant. We believe unquestioningly that\r\nit will continue its good work by ensuring the orderly accomplishment\r\nof the new regulations, in the spirit of peace and benevolence; and\r\nthat each landowner will complete within, the limits of his own\r\nestate, the great civic movement of the whole body, by organising the\r\nexistence of the peasants settled on his lands, and that of his domestic\r\nservants, upon conditions advantageous to both sides, thus setting the\r\nrural population a good example, and encouraging it in the exact and\r\nconscientious fulfilment of the state regulations.\r\n\r\nThe examples that We have in view of the generous solicitude of the\r\nlandlords for the welfare of the peasants, and the gratitude of the\r\npeasants for the beneficent solicitude of the landlords, confirm in Us\r\nthe hope that mutual, spontaneous agreement will solve the greater number\r\nof difficulties; difficulties which are inevitable in the adaptation\r\nof general rules to the diversity of conditions existent in separate\r\nestates; and that by this means the transition from the old order to the\r\nnew will be facilitated, and that for the future, mutual confidence,\r\ngood understanding and unanimous striving for the common welfare will be\r\nconsolidated.\r\n\r\nFor the more convenient accomplishment of those agreements between the\r\nlandlords and peasants, by which the latter will acquire property,\r\ntogether with the farms and agricultural appendages, assistance will also\r\nbe afforded by the government, on the basis of special rules, by the\r\npayment of loans, and the transfer of debts lying on the estates.\r\n\r\nWe rely upon the good sense of Our people. When the government’s idea\r\nof the abolition of serfdom became spread amongst the peasants who were\r\nunprepared for it, it aroused partial misunderstandings. Some thought of\r\nliberty and forgot all about obligations. But the mass of the people did\r\nnot waver in the conviction, that by natural reasoning, a society that\r\nfreely enjoyed benefits must mutually minister to the welfare of society\r\nby the fulfilment of certain obligations, and that in accordance with\r\nthe Christian law, _every soul_ must be _subject unto the higher powers_\r\n(Rom. xiii, 1), must _render therefore to all their dues_, and especially\r\nto whom are due _tribute_, _custom_, _fear_, _honour_ (v. 7); that the\r\nlawfully acquired rights of the landowners cannot be taken from them\r\nwithout fitting recompense for their voluntary concession; and that it\r\nwould be opposed to all justice to avail oneself of the land belonging to\r\nthe landlord without rendering certain obligations in return for it.\r\n\r\nAnd now we hopefully expect that the serfs, in view of the new future\r\nopening for them, will understand and gratefully receive the great\r\nsacrifice made by the honourable nobility for the improvement of their\r\ncondition.\r\n\r\nThey will understand, that having received a firmer foundation of\r\nproperty and greater freedom in the disposition of their agricultural\r\nlabours, they have become bound, before society and themselves to\r\ncomplete the beneficence of the new law by a faithful, well-intentioned\r\nand diligent use of the rights conferred by it upon them. The most\r\nbeneficent law cannot make people happy and prosperous, if they do not\r\nthemselves labour to establish their felicity under the protection of the\r\nlaw. Competence and ease are not acquired and increased otherwise than by\r\nunremitting labour, a wise use of powers and means, strict thrift and an\r\nhonest, God-fearing life.\r\n\r\nThe executors of this new system will see that it is accomplished in an\r\norderly and tranquil manner, so that the attention of the agriculturists\r\nmay not be drawn off from their necessary agricultural occupations. May\r\nthey carefully cultivate the earth, and gather its fruits in order that\r\nafterwards from well-filled granaries the seed may be taken for sowing\r\nthe land that is for their perpetual enjoyment, or that will be acquired\r\nby them as their own property.\r\n\r\nSign yourselves with the sign of the cross, orthodox people, and call\r\nupon God with Us for His blessing on your free labour, on your homes and\r\non the public welfare.\r\n\r\nGiven in St. Petersburg, on the nineteenth day of February in the year\r\none thousand eight hundred and sixty-one from the birth of Christ, and\r\nthe seventh of Our reign.\r\n\r\n                                                             ALEXANDER.[f]\r\n\r\n\r\nEFFECTS OF THE NEW CONDITIONS\r\n\r\nLet us now turn our attention to the epoch in which this law was\r\npublished. As regards the effect of the new law on the mind of the\r\npopulation, it was soon evidenced, that the cultivated classes, burdened\r\nas they were with sacrifices for the work of reform, expressed their joy\r\nand satisfaction at this great acquisition, far more readily than the\r\npeasants, whom it immediately concerned. The disaffected portion of the\r\nRussian nobility was and remained decidedly in the minority, especially\r\nunder the first impression of the great and decided step that had been\r\ntaken, and no one ventured to manifest disapproval. Public opinion had\r\ndeclared itself too decidedly in favour of the government for any one\r\nto venture on opposition. On the contrary, the number was by no means\r\nunimportant, of those among the nobles and officials, who exceeded even\r\nthe demands of the government, and who could not suppress their vexation,\r\nthat their desire that the lands possessed by the community should be\r\ngratuitously transferred into their property, had been disregarded.\r\nAlthough these voices were not distinctly audible until a later period,\r\nstill from the first they had influence, because they could reckon on\r\nthe sympathies of the freed portion of the population. Moreover a great\r\npart of the nobles, at that time, looked for a rich compensation for the\r\nsacrifice they had made; they hoped to be able to excite public opinion\r\nin favour of the embryo demand for the restoration of a constitution,\r\nand by its assistance to reach the desired goal. Thus the disaffected\r\nfeelings of the hitherto ruling classes were veiled, and maintained in\r\none balance, by hopes of the future; at the most a small band of stubborn\r\nadherents to the system of Nicholas grumbled at the liberalism come into\r\nfashion, could not conceal their vexation at the loss of their revenues,\r\nand used every effort to recover their lost influence in the court\r\ncircles.\r\n\r\nThe Russian peasant received the important tidings of the breaking of\r\nhis fetters with profound silence; and some time elapsed before he had\r\nmade up his mind what position to assume with regard to it. Partly, the\r\nhabitual want of freedom had become too inveterate, and was too deeply\r\nrooted, to be at once cast aside; and partly, the attention of the people\r\nwas too eagerly directed to the still pending agricultural arrangements\r\nwith the proprietors, for the publication of the emancipation edict to\r\nmake at once any evident impression. The effect of the emancipation act\r\nwas felt most strongly and evidently in the two capitals of the empire;\r\nhere there were thousands of serfs living (as merchants, second-hand\r\ndealers, artisans, drivers, servants, etc.) who had been obliged to\r\npurchase with high obroc-payments the right of seeking their gain, and\r\nwere always in danger of being recalled by the will of their masters\r\nand constrained to return to the old position of dependence. To these,\r\nthe advantages of the newly established arrangement of things were\r\nmanifest, and the fruits of it could at once be enjoyed; the emancipation\r\nlaw limited the duration of their dependence to merely two years, and\r\nfixed an unimportant obroc-sum for this transition period. From these\r\ntown-serfs, therefore, proceeded the first exhibitions of thankfulness\r\nand joy, the first ovations to the “liberating czar.” But here also the\r\nweak, womanish character of the Slavonic race did not belie itself; there\r\nwas no idea of passionate outbursts. The St. Petersburg descriptions\r\nof those momentous February days tell most characteristically of\r\nintoxicated bands of bearded cab-drivers and artisans, who reeled through\r\nthe streets, humming as they went “Volyushka, Volyushka,” (literally,\r\n“beloved freedom”). Truly effective, however, was the shout of rejoicing,\r\nwith which the masses of the people received the emperor when he quitted\r\nthe winter-palace, on the 19th of February, in order to be present at the\r\nreading of the emancipation-ukase in the Kazan church; and subsequently,\r\nthe addresses sent to the emperor by the drivers and lower class of\r\ncitizens in the two capitals, who had been freed from serfdom.\r\n\r\nAlthough this law had been published throughout the whole empire on the\r\nsame day in all churches, and the peace-mediators (_mirovuye-Posredniki_)\r\nhad at once proceeded to regulate the agricultural questions, the first\r\nmore important manifestations in the country did not occur until two\r\nmonths later, in the end of April, 1861. These were manifestations of\r\ndissatisfaction and disappointment, which appeared east of the Volga, and\r\nhad the districts of Kazan and Nijni-Novgorod for their principal centre.\r\nIn all probability they were revolutionary agitators from the higher and\r\nmore cultivated classes who first scattered the seeds of discontent. The\r\npeople were persuaded that the true emancipation-ukase of the czar had\r\nbeen craftily intercepted by the nobles and officials; that the will\r\nof the czar was to consign to the peasants, without compensation or\r\nhindrance, the land they had hitherto cultivated. These doctrines fell\r\non a soil all the more ready, as the services yielded to the masters\r\nwere in the eyes of the people of a purely personal nature, and were\r\nno equivalents for the lands conceded to the communities. “We belong\r\nto the proprietors, but the common land belongs to us,” was the creed\r\nof the peasant; hence the feeling was, that the abolition of personal\r\nservitude was synonymous with the establishment of free property. In\r\nthe Kazan district, matters soon reached a pitch of open refusal to\r\nobedience; and when the magistrates interfered, they amounted to attempts\r\nat resistance. Popular discontent assumed at once a genuinely national\r\nstamp; it found a leader in a new Pugatchev, the peasant Anton Petrov,\r\nwho personated the czar (who had fled from St. Petersburg, pursued by the\r\nboyars); and within a short time he had gathered round him 10,000 men.\r\nAfter vain attempts to bring back the infatuated men by gentle means to\r\nobedience, military power was obliged to be employed. Some battalions,\r\nled by Count Apraxin, marched through the insurgent country, and took\r\nthe ringleader prisoner; and after Petrov had fallen into their hands,\r\nand had been immediately shot, order was again so completely established,\r\nthat in May nothing further was thought of this episode. The peasants\r\nreturned to their obedience, and everywhere the arrangements of the\r\npeace-arbitrator were complied with. Yet the idea of the perfect freedom\r\nhoped for, was not yet wholly forgotten; the Volga districts remained for\r\nsome time longer the scene of revolutionary experiments, which excited\r\nthe people with the hope of a “new freedom” still to be expected and\r\nheld fast to the old idea of a gratuitous division of the soil. Under\r\nthe title _Zemliyä i Volyä_ (Land and Freedom), there appeared from time\r\nto time secretly published pamphlets, which endeavoured to give the\r\nagrarian question a revolutionary colouring, and which were numerously\r\ncirculated, in the eastern districts especially. These manifestations\r\nof a propaganda, secretly inflaming the public mind, we shall meet with\r\nagain in other places, and under other forms.\r\n\r\nIn general, the completion of the arrangement between peasant and lord\r\nwas unexpectedly quick, and favourable in its course. Little as it can be\r\nasserted, that the Russian peasant subsequently made a just use of his\r\nnewborn liberty, or that agricultural progress exhibited any favourable\r\ninfluence from it; still it is evident, that the peasant population\r\nmanifested in the arrangement good-will, a just insight into the state\r\nof affairs, and great tractableness; and that this matter was justly\r\nconceived and handled by those entrusted with it. The execution of\r\nthe law of the 19th of February, 1861, was not placed in the hands of\r\nordinary magistrates, but was consigned to officials, who were selected\r\n_ad hoc_ from the number of landed proprietors, and were furnished\r\nwith extensive authority. It was a happy idea, and one of decided and\r\nlasting importance, that these peace mediators, or arbitrators, as they\r\nwere called, were not reckoned in the service of the state, and were\r\nnot fettered to the orders of the bureaucratic hierarchy. For the first\r\ntime in Russia, men of the most different calling, and social position,\r\nstood side by side with equal right to join hands for the execution of\r\na patriotic work, which promised neither title, rank, nor advancement.\r\nGenerals in command, and mere lieutenants, councillors of the state, and\r\nsimple titular councillors, once the choice of their fellow-citizens and\r\nclass-equals fell on them, demanded leave of absence from service, in\r\norder to undertake, according to the law, the demarcation between the\r\nestates of the nobles and the lands of the community within definite\r\ndistricts, and to induce both parties to agree; it was only where this\r\nresult could not be attained, that the strict orders of the regulations\r\nwere enforced, and the co-operation of higher authority was appealed\r\nto.[h]\r\n\r\n\r\nABOLITION OF CORPORAL PUNISHMENT (1863 A.D.)\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [1863 A.D.]]\r\n\r\nThe first reform that followed on the abolition of the law of serfdom,\r\nwhich had been an unsurmountable obstacle to any improvement and reform\r\nin the political organisation of the state, was the abolition of the\r\ncruel and shameful corporal punishments which were formerly allotted for\r\ncrimes.\r\n\r\nIn the beginning of the reign of Alexander II attention had been\r\ndirected to the fact that corporal punishment as a punitive measure\r\ndid not accomplish the reformation amendment of the criminal, but only\r\ndishonoured the personality of the man, lowered his feeling of honour and\r\ndestroyed in him the sense of his manhood.\r\n\r\nThe emperor began by diminishing the number of offences amenable to\r\ncorporal punishment; the new position which had been given to the\r\npeasants by the abolition of serfdom, soon led to the almost total\r\nsuppression of corporal punishment for them.\r\n\r\nOn the 29th of April, 1863, an imperial ukase followed, by which corporal\r\npunishment was entirely abolished as a punitive measure, determined by\r\nthe sentence of the public tribunals. By this memorable ukase, which\r\nwill ever remain a glorious monument in the legislation of Russia, were\r\nabolished by the will of the czar-liberator, the last traces of slavery\r\nin Russia, the running of the gauntlet, the spur, the lash, the cat, the\r\nbranding of the human body, all passed away into eternal oblivion; the\r\npunishment of the rod to which persons belonging to the class not exempt\r\nfrom corporal punishment had hitherto been subjected was replaced for\r\nthem by arrest or confinement in prison, and was preserved only in two or\r\nthree cases and then in the most moderate measure.\r\n\r\n\r\nREFORMS IN THE COURTS OF JUSTICE\r\n\r\nAlmost simultaneously with the establishment of the provincial and\r\nterritorial institutions, the emperor Alexander II recognised it as\r\nindispensable for the welfare of his people, to reform the existing\r\njudiciary system and law proceedings, to render all his subjects equal\r\nbefore the legal authorities, and to afford them all the same protection\r\nof the tribunals and the law.\r\n\r\nAncient Russian tribunals, as is well known, were far from being\r\ndistinguished either by their uprightness or the rapidity of their\r\nprocedure. It is hardly necessary to remind readers that justice was\r\nadministered in secret, behind closed doors, besides which not merely\r\noutsiders were refused admittance to the courts, but even the persons\r\nimplicated and interested in the affair. Such chancery secrecy resulted\r\nin great lack of truth and justice in the tribunals. Taking advantage\r\nof the secrecy of the proceedings, the judges allowed themselves to\r\ncommit every possible abuse: they extorted money from the suitors,\r\nbehaved unfairly and against their own consciences, distorted facts and\r\nafterwards decided the affair in accordance with their own views and\r\npleasure, that is, as was most advantageous and convenient to them.\r\nAnother great defect in the ancient Russian tribunals was due to the\r\nfact that the entire procedure was carried on in them exclusively on\r\npaper, upon the foundation of notes alone; verbal explanations were not\r\npermitted in the tribunals. This complicated form of written procedure\r\nled to litigations of incredible length; the most trivial lawsuit\r\nsometimes dragged on for years, requiring enormous expenditure and\r\noften in the end ruining the litigants. In a like manner, the accused,\r\nnot infrequently innocent people, and only suspected of some crime or\r\noffence, had to languish for years in prison, awaiting the termination of\r\ntheir affairs before the courts.\r\n\r\nThe emperor Alexander II was well aware of all these defects and\r\nimperfections in the ancient courts of justice, and as a true friend of\r\nhumanity, could not remain indifferent to such an order of things. He\r\ntherefore desired that there should be established in Russia a system\r\nof justice that would be “speedy, righteous, merciful, and equitable.”\r\nThe reign of truth and mercy in the tribunals could be attained only by\r\na complete reorganisation of the ancient tribunals, in consequence of\r\nwhich, by command of the czar, new legal statutes were composed, and\r\nreceived the imperial confirmation towards the end of November, 1864.\r\n\r\nThe enormous superiority of the new tribunals over the old ones was at\r\nonce evident. The new courts, carrying on their business in public,\r\npunished crimes without respect of persons; all Russian subjects were\r\nrecognised as equal before the law and the courts. The appearance of\r\njustices of the peace had a particular importance for the people newly\r\nliberated from the dependence of serfdom; they afforded the hitherto\r\npoor and almost defenceless lower classes a possibility of protecting\r\nthemselves against every kind of offence, violence and oppression, and of\r\nclaiming their legal rights almost without trouble or expense.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE POLISH INSURRECTION OF 1863\r\n\r\nIn spite of his ardent reformatory activity in the interior of the\r\nempire, the emperor Alexander II did not neglect foreign policy.\r\nAlthough, at the conclusion of the Crimean war, the emperor had\r\nrecognised the necessity of a prolonged peace for Russia, and therefore\r\ncontinually endeavoured to avoid becoming entangled in the affairs of\r\nnations, nevertheless in all cases where the interests of Russia were\r\naffected, he firmly and calmly declared his requirements, and by means of\r\npeaceful persuasions maintained the honour and interests of his country.\r\n\r\nThe suppression of the Polish rebellion of 1863 is particularly\r\nremarkable in this respect: The amelioration of conditions in Poland had\r\noccupied Alexander II immediately after his accession to the throne, and\r\nhe had at once eliminated inequalities of legislation between his Russian\r\nand Polish subjects: all that was granted to Russia was granted also to\r\nthe kingdom of Poland.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A MESTCHER COSTUME]\r\n\r\nAll these favours aroused a feeling of gratitude in the more moderate and\r\nwiser portion of the population. But they were not received in the same\r\nspirit by those Poles who dreamed of the re-establishment of the ancient\r\nPoland with its former frontiers, and of giving entire self-government\r\nto the kingdom by means of its separation from Russia, and the formation\r\nof a separate state. These persons looked with hostility upon all the\r\nactions of the Russian government and, with the design of entering into\r\nan open conflict with Russia, secretly began to incite the people of\r\nPoland to revolt.\r\n\r\nIn January, 1863, a fresh insurrection burst forth in Poland. But the\r\nrevolutionaries were unsuccessful, and the Russian troops defeated them\r\nat every point, taking 300 prisoners and a considerable number of guns.\r\nBeing desirous of again trying mild measures, and in the hope of at last\r\nbringing the Poles to reason, the emperor declared that pardon would\r\nbe granted to all who laid down their arms by the 13th of May. But the\r\nterm allotted expired without good sense having triumphed. Then Count\r\nBirg was appointed viceroy in Warsaw, and Adjutant-General Muraviev,\r\ngovernor-general of the northwest border. Under the direction of these\r\ntwo men, the conflict took a more decided character and the suppression\r\nof the rebellion was made effective.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, when the insurrection was already almost put down by the\r\nRussian troops, three great western European powers--England, France and\r\nAustria--expressed their sympathy with the Polish movement and at the\r\nsame time gave the Poles hopes of assistance. Having concerted together,\r\nand being besides supported by Turkey, these powers simultaneously sent\r\nthe Russian government threatening exactions for concessions to Poland.\r\nNaturally, these pretensions on the part of the powers were offensive\r\nto Russian national honour. A feeling of profound indignation and\r\nwounded dignity took possession of the Russian nation, and readiness\r\nwas expressed to sacrifice everything to the defence of the fatherland.\r\nPrince A. M. Gortchakov showed himself a worthy champion of Alexander II\r\nin the resistance shown to the European powers.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [1864 A.D.]]\r\n\r\nMeeting with such decided opposition to their interference, the powers\r\nbecame convinced that the entire Russian nation stood behind the czar,\r\nand they were obliged to withdraw their exactions. The final suppression\r\nof the Polish insurrection became thenceforth a matter of internal\r\npolicy. Complete tranquillity was restored in Poland in the year 1864.\r\n\r\nFollowing on these events a series of measures was undertaken tending to\r\nthe gradual union of the kingdom of Poland with the Russian empire. The\r\nmost beneficial of all these measures was the ukase of the 2nd of March,\r\n1864, for the reorganisation of the peasantry in the kingdom of Poland.\r\n\r\nStrictly speaking, the law of serfdom had been abolished in Poland as\r\nearly as the beginning of the nineteenth century, but the freedom the\r\npeasants had then received was no better than servitude; they were\r\nindividually free, but had no share in the possession of land. By virtue\r\nof the ukase of the 2nd of March, 1864, the land of which the peasants\r\nhad the use became their property, and the compensation to the landowners\r\nwas defrayed by the state.\r\n\r\nUpon this important measure followed a series of other measures,\r\ncontributing to the development of the general welfare of Poland; and\r\nfinally in 1869, it was declared by the imperial will that measures\r\nshould be taken for the complete union of the kingdom of Poland with the\r\nother parts of the empire, by which the definitive pacification of Poland\r\nwas completed.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SUBJECTION OF THE CAUCASUS (1864 A.D.)\r\n\r\nThe subjection of the Caucasus took place in the year after the\r\nsuppression of the Polish insurrection.\r\n\r\nOf all the nations that populated the Caucasus, only the Georgians and\r\nArmenians had succeeded, some centuries before the birth of Christ, in\r\nestablishing independent kingdoms. But being surrounded by powerful and\r\nwarlike mountaineers and bounded on the south by the dominions of Persia\r\nand Turkey, the kingdoms of Georgia and Armenia had gradually fallen into\r\ndecay, and therefore Georgia itself turned to Russia, as professing the\r\nsame religion, with the request to be received into the empire. Yielding\r\nto the urgent request of the unfortunate country, the emperor Paul I, who\r\nwas then reigning in Russia, annexed Georgia in 1800 A.D.\r\n\r\nAfter the annexation of Georgia to Russia, the mountain people made\r\ntheir appearance from the north and south amongst Russian possessions,\r\nbut by continuing their previous plundering and incursions into Russian\r\nterritory, they hindered relations between the Caucasus and the empire.\r\nThus, in order to secure the tranquil possession of Georgia nothing\r\nremained but to subject to Russian domination those wild tribes of the\r\nMohammedan faith which lived in the mountains separating Russia from the\r\nCaucasus. Therefore during the first years of the nineteenth century\r\nthere commenced an almost continuously persistent and truly heroic\r\nstruggle of the Russian army against the Caucasian tribes, which was\r\nprolonged for more than sixty years until that definitive subjection of\r\nthe Caucasus which took place during the reign of Alexander II.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Taking of Schamyl_\r\n\r\nThe struggle against the Caucasian mountaineers was rendered peculiarly\r\ndifficult at that time by the appearance of Schamyl as their leader,\r\nuniting as he did all the qualities of a brave and experienced soldier to\r\nhis spiritual calling. The possessor of an iron will and an astonishing\r\nskill in ruling over the wild mountain tribes, Schamyl converted them\r\ninto an organ of war which he directed against the Russians. Added\r\nto this he fortified the almost impregnable mountains, constructed\r\nexcellent fortresses and established powder-works, foundries, etc.\r\nSeeing all this the Russians began to carry on a regular warfare against\r\nthe mountaineers. The commander-in-chief in the Caucasus, who also\r\nexercised the functions of Caucasian viceroy, was Adjutant-general Prince\r\nBariatinski, with whose nomination the war took a decisive turn.\r\n\r\nPrince Bariatinski directed his efforts first of all against the eastern\r\ngroup of the Caucasian mountains. The general aggressive movement of the\r\nRussian army, which was accomplished after mature reflection, soon placed\r\nSchamyl in an embarrassing position which put an end to the fascination\r\nhe had exercised over the mountaineers, who had hitherto been blindly\r\ndevoted to him. One tribe after another fell away from Schamyl and\r\ndeclared its submission to Russia. Defeated and pressed on every side,\r\nSchamyl fled to Daghestan, the extreme eastern province of the Caucasus,\r\non the shores of the Caspian Sea and took refuge with his family and\r\na little band of adherents in the village of Gunib situated on the\r\nheights of an inaccessible mountain, where he decided to defend himself\r\nto the last. Meanwhile, the Russian troops, which had indefatigably\r\npursued Schamyl, finally besieged him at Gunib and surrounded the\r\nvillage itself with a thick chain of soldiers. Upon the proposal of the\r\ncommander-in-chief to put an end to the useless defence, and to spare the\r\nvillage the horrors of an assault, Schamyl, hitherto deemed invincible,\r\nsaw his hopeless position, left his refuge, and surrendered himself as\r\nprisoner on the 6th of September, 1859, throwing himself upon the mercy\r\nof the czar. The taking of Schamyl produced an impression of astonishment\r\non all the mountain tribes: the whole Caucasus trembled with desire for\r\npeace. After the taking of Gunib, and the captivity of Schamyl the whole\r\neastern portion of the Caucasus submitted to the Russian domination.\r\n\r\nAfter this all the efforts of the Russian troops were immediately\r\ndirected towards the western Caucasus, adjoining the eastern shore of the\r\nBlack Sea; but the definitive subjection of this part of the Caucasus\r\nrequired yet four years of uninterrupted and unrelaxed conflicts.\r\nMeanwhile, at the beginning of the year 1863, Field-marshal Prince\r\nBariatinski was on account of impaired health replaced by a new Caucasian\r\nviceroy in the person of the emperor’s youngest brother, the grand duke\r\nMichael Nikolaivitch, after which the aggressive movements of the Russian\r\ntroops proceeded with such rapidity, that the entire conquest of the\r\nwestern portion of the Caucasus was accomplished in the spring of the\r\nyear 1864. Thus ended the costly and bloody Caucasian war, and since then\r\nall the Caucasus has belonged to Russia.\r\n\r\n\r\nWARS WITH KHOKAND AND BOKHARA\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [1864-1867 A.D.]]\r\n\r\nFollowing on the subjection of the Caucasus, Russia began to settle\r\naccounts with three small neighbouring Mohammedan khanates, those of\r\nKhokand, Bokhara, and Khiva. These khanates were situated amidst the\r\narid, sandy steppes of central Asia and were populated by half savage\r\nrobber tribes who continually made audacious incursions upon Russian\r\ncentral Asian frontier possessions, attacking Russian mercantile\r\ncaravans, and plundering the merchants, either killing or carrying\r\nthem into captivity and selling them as slaves. All this greatly\r\nhindered Russian trade with Asia, it destroyed the tranquillity of\r\nRussian frontier possessions and therefore had long been a source of\r\npreoccupation and disquietude on the part of the Russian government.\r\n\r\nTherefore, in 1864, two small detachments of Russian troops under the\r\ncommand of Colonel Tchernaiev and General Verevkine, were despatched from\r\ntwo sides for the punishment of the hostile tribes and the preservation\r\nof the Russian eastern frontier from their plundering incursions. Colonel\r\nTchernaiev, by storm, took the Khokand fortress of Auliet, while General\r\nVerevkine seized the Khokand town of Turkestan. In the following year,\r\n1865, General Tchernaiev took by assault one of the most important towns\r\nof the Khokand khanate--Tashkend--after which the khan of Khokand ceased\r\nhostilities and declared his submission to the Russian czar.\r\n\r\nThen, however, one of the khanates neighbouring upon that of\r\nKhokand--Bokhara--began to disturb peace on the Russian frontiers and it\r\nbecame necessary to quiet it. A detachment of Russian troops under the\r\ncommand of General Romanovski was sent against Bokhara.\r\n\r\nThe war with Bokhara was as successful as that with Khokand. In the\r\nyear 1866 the chief forces of the emir of Bokhara were utterly defeated\r\nand the Russians took some towns and fortresses. But it was only after\r\nthe Russian troops had taken the ancient, famous, and wealthy town of\r\nSamarkand, that the emir finally submitted, being bound by a special\r\ntreaty to allow the Russian merchants entire liberty to trade in the\r\nBokharan possessions, and to abolish slavery throughout his dominions.\r\nThis greatly raised the prestige of the czar in Asia.\r\n\r\nThe newly conquered territories in central Asia (in Khokand and Bokhara)\r\nwere joined to the Russian possessions, and from them was formed (in\r\n1867) the special government general of Turkestan, with Tashkend for its\r\nchief town.[d]\r\n\r\n\r\nA GLANCE AT THE PAST HISTORY OF BOKHARA\r\n\r\nIt may be of interest to recall in a few words the past history of the\r\nsomewhat important territory thus acquired by Russia. We have already\r\nbecome acquainted with Bokhara in ancient history under the name of\r\nSogdiana; afterwards in Persian history it appears as T̈ransoxania, or\r\nby the Arabic name of Mawarra an-nahr. The country was conquered by the\r\nArabs in the early part of the eighth century, and towards the end of the\r\nninth it was conquered by Ismail, the founder of the Samanids dynasty,\r\nwho became emir of Bokhara and Kharezm (Khiva) in 893. Towards the end of\r\nthe eleventh century the celebrated Seljuk sultan Malik Shah conquered\r\nthe country beyond the Oxus, and in 1216 it came for a short time under\r\nthe power of the Kharezmian prince, Muhammed Kutbuddin. In about 1220 the\r\nland was subdued by Jenghiz Khan and incorporated into the khanate of\r\nJagatai. Bokhara remained under the successors of Jenghiz until the whole\r\ncountry was overrun and conquered by Timur (Tamerlane), who selected\r\nSamarkand as his capital and raised it to a high stage of prosperity.\r\nThe descendants of Timur ruled in the country until about the year 1500,\r\nwhen they were overthrown by the Usbeg Tatars under Muhammed Shaibani,\r\na descendant of Shaiban, the fifth son of Juji. Muhammed ruled over\r\nT̈ransoxania, Ferghana, Khwarizm and Hissar, but in 1510 he was defeated\r\nand killed by Shah Ismail, the founder of the Persian dynasty of Sufi.\r\n\r\nThe Shaibani dynasty ruled for nearly a century when it was replaced\r\nby the dynasty of Astrakhan, a house related to the Shaibanis by\r\nmarriage. Under two rulers of this family--Iman Kuli Khan and Subhankuli\r\nKhan--Bokhara recovered somewhat of its former glory, and Subhankuli\r\nruled over Khiva also for a time. In 1740 Bokhara had been so reduced\r\nunder weak rulers that it offered its submission to Nadir Shah of Persia,\r\nand after his death the Astrakhan dynasty was overthrown by the house of\r\nMangit (1784), which is the dynasty at present ruling in the country.\r\nUnder the first sovereign of this family, Mir Maasum, Bokhara enjoyed a\r\ncertain degree of prosperity, although the ruler was a cruel tyrant and\r\na bigoted ascetic. He led a curious life of pretended piety, living in\r\nfilth and misery although surrounded by wealth. He conquered and almost\r\nexterminated the city of Merv and invaded and devastated Khorassan. At\r\nhis death in 1802 he was succeeded by his son Saïd, a weak ruler who\r\nlived until 1826. He was succeeded by one of the worst tyrants who ever\r\noccupied a throne--the emir Nasrullah Bahuder; he was cruel, lustful,\r\ntreacherous, hypocritical, ungrateful to friends, whom he rewarded for\r\nservice by putting them to death--in short, he appears to have had all\r\nthe vices it is possible for a human being to have. It was during his\r\nreign that England and Russia tried to acquire influence in Bokhara.\r\nTwo English envoys, Colonel Stoddart and Captain Conolly, were executed\r\nin 1842 after several years’ imprisonment in a loathsome dungeon. The\r\nRussian envoy did indeed come away alive from the court of the tyrant but\r\nhe succeeded in gaining no concessions for his country. Nasrullah died\r\nin 1860, his last act being to have his wife killed and her head brought\r\nto his bedside. He was succeeded by his son Mozaffer-eddin, during whose\r\nreign the Russian conquest took place.[a]\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CONQUEST OF KHIVA (1873 A.D.)\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [1873 A.D.]]\r\n\r\nAfter Khokand and Bokhara came the turn of Khiva. In the early spring\r\nof 1873 three detachments of Russian troops marched on Khiva from\r\ndifferent sides under the command of the governor-general of Turkestan,\r\nAdjutant-general V. P. von Kaufmann. Incredible privations and\r\ndifficulties had to be borne and overcome by the Russian troops during\r\nthis march across the steppes. First they endured frosts and snowstorms,\r\nand then under the sun’s burning rays they courageously accomplished\r\nin the space of one month a thousand versts march across a desert, and\r\nfinally reached the borders of the khanate of Khiva in the beginning of\r\nMay. In three weeks’ time the entire khanate was subjugated; some of the\r\ntowns were taken after a combat, others surrendered without resistance,\r\nand on the 10th of June the capital of the khanate--Khiva--fell. The\r\nRussian troops entered the town in triumph, covered with fresh glory.\r\n\r\nAfter the taking of Khiva by the Russians, the khan of Khiva fled to\r\nthe steppes, but he afterwards returned and declared his submission, in\r\nconsequence of which he was reinstated on his throne. But in spite of\r\nthis a portion of the Khivan possessions fell to Russia. Besides this,\r\nthe khan had to acknowledge a partial dependence upon Russia, he was\r\nobliged to reimburse her by a considerable sum of money for the expenses\r\nincurred in the campaign, and to allow the Russian merchants to trade\r\nfreely in his dominions; he was pledged to discountenance plundering,\r\nto set at liberty all prisoners and slaves, and to abolish throughout\r\nhis possessions forever all traffic in slaves. Thus, through the medium\r\nof the Czar Liberator, freedom was brought into central Asia--the land\r\nof slavery and of arbitrary rule. The complete pacification of a great\r\ncountry was accomplished.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE RUSSO-TURKISH WAR (1877-1878 A.D.)\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [1875-1877 A.D.]]\r\n\r\nBesides the wars already enumerated, Russia had, under the reign of the\r\nCzar Liberator, to carry on another war, which entailed innumerable\r\nsacrifices.\r\n\r\nIn the summer of 1875, the Slavonians of the two Turkish dependencies\r\nof Bosnia and Herzegovina, inhabited by Servian races, rose against\r\ntheir oppressors, the Turks, and decided to take up arms in defence of\r\ntheir faith, freedom, and property, and the honour of their wives and\r\ndaughters, and to endeavour to obtain equal rights with the Mussulman\r\nsubjects of Turkey.\r\n\r\nIn the summer of 1876 the neighbouring Slavonian principalities of\r\nMontenegro and Servia came to the aid of the Bosnians and Herzegovinians,\r\nand declared war against Turkey. The Montenegrins were under the\r\nleadership of their Prince Nicholas, and the Servian troops under the\r\ncommand of the Russian General Tchernaiev, the hero of Tashkend, who\r\nvolunteered his services to the Slavonians.\r\n\r\nAlthough Montenegro, which was small in the number of its sons, but\r\nmighty by their bravery and their love of freedom, had more than once\r\ndefeated the Turkish army, Servia with her few troops could not stand\r\nagainst the Turkish troops, which definitively overcame the Servian\r\nforces and were about to invade the frontiers of Servia. Russia, however,\r\ndid not allow this invasion to take place, and in October, 1876, the\r\nemperor Alexander II required from the Turkish sultan the immediate\r\ncessation of further hostilities against the Servians, and in order to\r\nsupport these demands he ordered that a portion of the Russian army\r\nshould be placed on a war footing. The decisive action of the czar\r\ntowards the Turkish government at once stopped the invasion of the\r\nTurkish hordes into Servia, and a two months’ armistice was concluded\r\nbetween Servia and Turkey.\r\n\r\nBut in spite of this, the Turks continued their cruelties amongst the\r\nChristians of the Balkans; defenceless Bulgaria in particular suffered\r\nfrom the fury of the Turks. They traversed the country with fire and\r\nsword, striving to stifle the movement taking place there by the savage\r\nslaughter of thousands of the inhabitants, without distinction of sex or\r\nage.\r\n\r\nFor a long while Russia endeavoured to avert the situation, without\r\nhaving recourse to arms, in order--as Alexander II expressed it--“to\r\navoid shedding the precious blood of the sons of Russia.” But all his\r\nefforts were unsuccessful, all means of arbitration were exhausted and\r\nalso the patience of that most peace-loving of monarchs, the emperor\r\nAlexander II. He found himself obliged to declare war against Turkey\r\nand to advance his troops towards the Turkish frontier. On the 19th of\r\nApril, 1877, the emperor joined his army at Kishinev, where it had been\r\ncommanded to assemble, and on the 24th of the same month, after public\r\nprayers, he informed the troops of their approaching entry upon the\r\nfrontiers of Turkey. Thus commenced the Russo-Turkish war, which was\r\ncarried on simultaneously in two parts of the world--in Europe and in\r\nAsia.\r\n\r\nThe commander-in-chief of the Russian troops upon the Asiatic theatre\r\nof the war was the grand-duke Michael Nikolaivitch, governor of the\r\nCaucasus. A few days after the issue of the manifesto declaring war,\r\nthe Russian troops had occupied the Turkish fortress of Bajazet without\r\na struggle (April 30th), and had proceeded to besiege the first class\r\nfortress of Kars, justly regarded as one of the chief points of support\r\nof the Turkish army in Asia Minor, after which at the beginning of\r\nMay they took by assault another sufficiently important Turkish\r\nfortress--that of Ardahan.\r\n\r\nAs to the Danubian army, of which the grand-duke Nicholas Nikolaivitch\r\nwas appointed commander-in-chief, on the very day of the declaration\r\nof war it entered into the principality of Roumania, which was subject\r\nto Turkey, and directed its march towards the Danube. At the passage\r\nof the Danube, the problem consisted in diverting the attention of the\r\nTurks from the spot where the chief forces of the Russian army were to\r\ncross. This was accomplished with entire success; complete secrecy was\r\nmaintained, and during the night between the 26th and 27th of June the\r\nRussian troops crossed the Danube with the assistance of pontoons and\r\nrafts, at a point where the Turks least expected it, namely from Zimnitzi\r\n(between the fortresses of Rustchuk and Nikopol) to Sistova; the Russian\r\nlosses in this great undertaking did not exceed 1,000 men fallen from\r\nthe ranks. Having thus crossed the Danube and disembarked on the enemy’s\r\nshores, the Russian troops, without giving their adversaries time to\r\nrecover, began to move into the heart of Bulgaria, and took town after\r\ntown and fortress after fortress from the Turks.\r\n\r\nBut in Asia as well as in Europe the first brilliant successes of the\r\nRussians were followed by some serious reverses, which like the victories\r\nwere first manifested upon the Asiatic seat of the war. The most serious\r\nreverse of the Russians in Asia was the unsuccessful attack (June 25th)\r\nupon the Turkish stronghold near Zeven, after which the Russian troops\r\nwere obliged to raise for a time even the siege of Kars, and to retire\r\nwithin their own frontiers. But the temporary reverses of the Russian\r\ntroops on the European theatre of the war were far more important. The\r\nmost serious reverse during the entire period of the Eastern war was the\r\nattack of the Russian troops upon Plevna. Plevna was an insignificant\r\nBulgarian town. The Russian troops hoped easily to overcome it, and on\r\nthe 20th of July a small detachment of them attacked Plevna. But it\r\nturned out that the Turks had already managed to concentrate considerable\r\nforces within the little town, under the command of the best of their\r\nleaders, the gifted and resolute Osman-Pasha, added to which the most\r\ntalented European engineers had constructed round Plevna, in the space of\r\na few days a network of fortifications, rendering Plevna an impregnable\r\nposition. In consequence of this the first attack of the Russian troops\r\non Plevna was repulsed by the Turks; the losses of the Russians amounted\r\nto three thousand killed.\r\n\r\nTen days later (on the 30th of July) the Russian troops made a second\r\nattack against Plevna. But this time again the attack resulted in a like\r\ndefeat; the enemy’s forces, which far exceeded those of the Russians,\r\nrepelled all the assaults of the Russian troops, added to which this\r\nsecond attack on Plevna cost the Russians 7,500 men. Following upon this,\r\nwith the arrival of fresh reinforcements for the army encamped before\r\nPlevna, a third and final heroic effort was made to take this fortified\r\nposition by storm. The chief part in the attack was taken by the brave\r\nyoung general Skobelev and his detachment. But in spite of his brilliant\r\naction, in spite of the heroism and self-sacrifice displayed by his\r\nsoldiers, this assault also was unsuccessful. On the 12th of September,\r\nSkobelev repulsed five furious attacks by the whole mass of Turks, but\r\nnot receiving assistance, he was obliged to retreat. This last reverse\r\ncost the Russians as many as 3,000 killed and nearly 10,000 wounded. But\r\nfollowing on these reverses came a rapidly successive series of victories\r\nof the Russian troops over the Turkish, both in Asia and in Europe.\r\n\r\nThe crowning success of the Russian troops in Asia was the fall on the\r\n18th of November of the terrible stronghold of Kars, which was taken\r\nby General Loris-Melikov, after a heroic assault by night. All Europe\r\nrecognised the taking of Kars as one of the greatest and most difficult\r\nof military exploits ever achieved. At the same time, on the European\r\ntheatre of the war, on the southern slope of the Balkans a great Turkish\r\nbody of troops was concentrated under the command of the talented leader\r\nSuleiman Pasha, with the object of retaking at any cost the Shipka pass,\r\nwhich was occupied by a small Russian detachment. During the space of\r\nseven days (from the 21st to the 28th of August) the Turks endeavoured to\r\nwrest from the Russians the Shipka pass, and a series of furious attacks\r\nwas made with this object. On the first two days a handful of heroes,\r\nwho defended the heights of Shipka, repulsed all the desperate efforts\r\nof Suleiman Pasha’s entire army! The echo of the incessant artillery\r\nfire became one endless roll of thunder. The Russian ranks dwindled and\r\nwere exhausted from wounds and fatigue. It was at that time that the\r\nRussian gunners, under the command of General Radetzki came to their\r\nassistance, and by the 24th of August fresh reinforcements arrived. The\r\nTurks’ insane attacks still continued during the 25th, 26th and 27th, but\r\non the evening of the 27th of August all was suddenly quiet; the Turks\r\nhad become convinced that they could not overcome the steadfastness and\r\nbravery of the Russian troops defending the Shipka pass, and had retired.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, after the third attempt on Plevna, it was decided not to\r\nrenew any more such dearly bought attacks, but to limit operations to\r\nencircling the Turkish positions in order to cut off communication\r\nbetween Plevna and the surrounding places, and thus to starve the Turks\r\ninto surrender.\r\n\r\nAt the end of October General Gurko’s division, amongst which were\r\nthe guards, took Gorni Dubinak, Telisch and a series of other Turkish\r\nstrongholds, situated to the southwest of Plevna and protecting the\r\nSophia road, along which reinforcements and stores had hitherto been\r\nbrought into Plevna, and thus to cut off entirely all communications\r\nbetween that town and the outside. After less than a month’s time all\r\nthe provisions that the Turks had in Plevna were definitively exhausted.\r\nOn the morning of the 10th of December, Osman Pasha, being desirous of\r\npenetrating through the Russian lines to the Danube, made a violent\r\nattempt to get out of Plevna. He cut his way through, but after some\r\nhours of desperate fighting--during which he was wounded in the leg--he\r\nwas thrown back and compelled to surrender, with all his army to the\r\nnumber of more than 40,000 men. This heated action cost the Russians 600\r\nmen killed, and double that amount wounded.\r\n\r\nTaking deeply to heart the successes of his valiant army and the holy\r\nwork for which it was fighting, the emperor Alexander II had at the end\r\nof May, 1877, at the very commencement, that is, of the war, arrived in\r\nBulgaria, and in spite of the weak state of his health had remained all\r\nthe while amongst the acting army of the Danube, sharing all reverses and\r\nprivations of military life on the march.\r\n\r\n“I go as a brother of mercy,” said the czar when he set off for the\r\nactive army. And actually, leaving to others all the martial glory of\r\nvictory over the enemy, the emperor concentrated his attention upon the\r\nsick and wounded soldiers to whom he showed himself not a brother, but a\r\nvery father of mercy. Zealously visiting the sick and wounded soldiers in\r\nthe hospitals and ambulances, the emperor showed them heartfelt sympathy,\r\ncomforted, encouraged, and sustained the sufferers, listened to their\r\ntales with fatherly love, and with his own hand rewarded those who had\r\ndistinguished themselves by their services in battle.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [1877-1878 A.D.]]\r\n\r\nThe wounded and their families were the object of the emperor Alexander’s\r\nunwearied care. He was rejoiced when the provisions sent out for the\r\nuse of the wounded by the empress Marie Alexandrovna arrived from St.\r\nPetersburg. Alexander unfailingly distributed them himself, carefully\r\ninquiring of each soldier what he wanted, what he liked, and strove\r\nto satisfy each sufferer: to the musicians he gave accordions, to the\r\nreaders books, to the smokers tobacco pouches, to the non-smokers tea,\r\ndainties, etc. Both soldiers and officers were as pleased as children at\r\nreceiving presents from the hand of the royal “brother of mercy,” and\r\nlistening to his cordial, gracious words. The soldiers’ love for the\r\nemperor, their joy and rapture at seeing him acted like living water on\r\nthe wounded; everyone that could move strove to rise, to stand up, to\r\ntake courage; they stretched out their hands to the czar, kissed his\r\nraiment and blessed his name. It was only after the fall of Plevna when\r\nthe war clearly inclined to the advantage of the Russians, and further\r\nsuccess was entirely secured that the emperor, bidding farewell to his\r\ntroops, left the active army and in the beginning of December, 1877,\r\nreturned to Russia.\r\n\r\nImmediately after the taking of Plevna it was decided that, without\r\nlosing time, the Balkans should be crossed. Meanwhile a severe winter had\r\nalready set in and the Turks did not even admit the possibility of the\r\nRussian troops crossing the Balkans at such a time. But here again all\r\nthe valour of the Russian army was displayed. To take a whole army across\r\nthe Balkans in winter was a work of the very greatest difficulty and\r\ndanger; but to cross the Trievna pass had never yet been attempted by any\r\narmy in the world. Strictly speaking, the chief part of the Russian army\r\ncrossed the Balkans at two other points, but it was part of the Russian\r\nstrategy to carry an insignificant portion of the troops across by the\r\nTrievna pass in order that the attention of the Turks should be diverted\r\nfrom the chief army, and the passage of the latter thus be facilitated.\r\nThe accomplishment of this terribly difficult and almost impossible feat\r\nwas entrusted to General Kartzov’s division. On the night between the 3rd\r\nand 4th of January the division moved on its road. After having reached\r\nby incredible efforts the very summit of the pass, where a short time\r\nwas spent, on the 7th of January General Kartzov’s division stormed the\r\nTurkish redoubt, forced their way into it and drove out the Turks. After\r\nthis the Russians had to descend to the so-called Valley of Roses on\r\nthe southern slope of the Balkans, which was even much steeper than the\r\nnorthern. As soon as the Russians had come down from Trievna, the Turks\r\nabandoned their positions at the feet of the Great Balkans, and General\r\nKartzov’s division entered into communication on one side with General\r\nGurko’s division, and on the other with the Shipka division of General\r\nRadetzki.\r\n\r\nAfter descending the Balkans to the Valley of Roses, General Radetzki,\r\ntogether with General Skobelev, who had come to his assistance after the\r\nfall of Plevna, attacked on the 9th of January an army of 40,000 Turks\r\nat Kezanlik, who after a stubborn resistance were defeated and taken\r\nprisoners. After having devastated and scattered the Turkish army of\r\nShipka and accomplished the feat unexampled in history of the passage\r\nof the Balkans, the Russian army continued its victorious advance;\r\nAdrianople, the second capital of the Turkish empire, was taken without a\r\nstruggle and the troops drew near to Constantinople itself. Then, on the\r\n3rd of March, 1878, at a little place called San Stefano, at ten versts\r\nfrom Constantinople, Turkey signed the conditions of peace offered her by\r\nRussia.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the great European powers required that three conditions of\r\npeace should be submitted to their consideration, and thus the treaty\r\nof San Stefano showed itself to be only a preliminary one; the great\r\nEuropean powers ratified it only after considerable changes. These\r\naltered conditions of peace were signed in 1878 by the plenipotentiaries\r\nof all the great powers at the Congress of Berlin; after which on the\r\n8th of February, 1879, a final treaty of peace, based on these same\r\nconditions, was signed at Constantinople between Russia and Turkey.\r\n\r\nThe emperor Alexander might certainly with full right have insisted\r\non the ratification of the treaty of peace of San Stefano without any\r\nalterations; but then Russia would have incurred a fresh war with Europe,\r\nwhile the emperor deeply felt the necessity of peace. It was time to\r\ngive the Russian people rest after they had made such sacrifices in the\r\nstruggle for their Slavonian brethren! Pitying his people, the emperor\r\ndecided--however painful it might be to him--not to insist on all that\r\nhad been gained at the price of Russian blood and confirmed by the treaty\r\nof San Stefano with Turkey, but consented in Berlin to great concessions\r\nwhich did not, however, in any way interfere with the liberation of the\r\nChristian population of Turkey.\r\n\r\nBy the treaties of San Stefano and Berlin, that part of Bessarabia was\r\nreturned to Russia which, by the Peace of Paris in 1856, had been ceded\r\nto her by Turkey after the Crimean campaign. Thanks to this, Russia again\r\nreached the mouths of the river Danube; in Asia she acquired a portion\r\nof the Turkish possessions, with the port of Batum and the fortress of\r\nKars, which guaranteed her security and future development. Finally, in\r\ncompensating for the military expenditure incurred by Russia, Turkey was\r\nbound to pay her an indemnity of 300 million rubles.\r\n\r\nThus terminated the Russo-Turkish War of 1877-1878--that decisive\r\nstruggle for the liberation of the Slavonians of the Balkan peninsula,\r\nand although in consequence of the interference of Europe Russia was\r\nfar from attaining what she had a right to expect after the enormous\r\nsacrifices she had made, and the glorious victories she had gained,\r\nnevertheless the great and sacred object of the war was attained; on the\r\nmemorable day of the emancipation of the peasants in Russia, also the\r\nSlavonian nations of the Balkan peninsula were liberated, by the help of\r\nRussia and her great monarch, from the Turkish yoke which had oppressed\r\nthem for ages. To the emperor Alexander II, who gave freedom to many\r\nmillions of his own subjects, was allotted also the glorious rôle of\r\nliberator of the Balkan Christians, by whom he was a second time named\r\nthe Czar Liberator!\r\n\r\n\r\nSPREAD OF EDUCATION AND CIVILISATION\r\n\r\nThe new order of things established in Russia, thanks to the great\r\nreforms of Emperor Alexander II, called forth a particular want of\r\neducated, enlightened men. They were necessary to the wise interpretation\r\nand execution of the luminous ideas of the czar-liberator.\r\n\r\nRecognising that the spread of education amongst the people is an\r\nindispensable condition of its prosperity, the emperor Alexander II,\r\nwho had become convinced by a personal survey of Russia, that one of\r\nthe chief obstacles to her progress lay in the ignorance of the people,\r\nwished to give to his subjects the means for the highest degree of\r\nenlightenment. This solicitude was expressed in a radical reform of\r\nall the educational establishments of the empire, beginning with the\r\nuniversity and finishing with the national schools. Properly speaking,\r\nit may be asserted that the primary national schools and village schools\r\nwere created during the reign of Alexander II, for until his reign the\r\nprimary education of the people was in a sad condition, and amongst them\r\nan almost total ignorance prevailed.\r\n\r\nHis legislation for the education of the masses should justly be\r\nnumbered amongst the most important works of the Czar Liberator. But\r\nmany were the other reforms accomplished by him that also had a great\r\nand beneficent signification for the Russian people. During the reign\r\nof the emperor Alexander II the country which had until then but few\r\nmeans of intercommunication, became covered with a network of railways.\r\nIn conjunction with the extraordinarily rapid development of railway\r\ncommunication, the postal service was perfected, the telegraph made its\r\nappearance, while commerce and trade acquired wide development. Finally,\r\nessential changes and improvements were introduced into the financial\r\nadministration of the empire; the police was reorganised and certain\r\nmodifications were granted to the press, in consequence of which there\r\nwas a powerful awakening in the intellectual life of the people.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE DEATH OF ALEXANDER II\r\n\r\nIn studying the wars which took place during the reign of Alexander\r\nII, it is impossible not to remark that they were all entered upon and\r\ncarried on, not under the influence of ambition, not with the thirst\r\nfor conquest, but exclusively out of a feeling of humanity, in order to\r\npreserve those living on the frontiers of the Russian empire from the\r\nplundering incursions of half savage Asiatic tribes (as was the case\r\nin the subjection of the Caucasus, of Khokand, Bokhara, and Khiva), or\r\nfor the deliverance of the oppressed co-religionists of Russia (as, for\r\nexample, the deliverance of the Slavonians of the Balkans).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A WINTER COSTUME]\r\n\r\nThe emperor Alexander II was actively solicitous for the welfare of\r\nhis subjects during the twenty-six years of his glorious reign, never\r\nlosing sight of the exaltation of the country and the consolidation of\r\nthe prosperity of the nation. But in spite of the indefatigable labours\r\nand fatherly care of the emperor Alexander II, in spite of the enormous\r\nservices he rendered to the country, of his boundless goodness of heart,\r\nhis great clemency and unusual humanity--amongst the Russian people were\r\nto be found those who had more than once tried by violence to shake the\r\nexisting state and social organisation of Russia and who did not stop\r\nat any crime for the attainment of their ends. Their boundless audacity\r\nfinally reached the last limits, and they dared more than once to make\r\nattempts on the life of the Czar-Liberator.\r\n\r\nOn the 2nd of March, 1880, the 25th year of the reign of the emperor\r\nAlexander II was accomplished, and this memorable day was celebrated with\r\nheartfelt enthusiasm in both capitals and throughout the whole Russian\r\nEmpire. But amongst the millions of joyous Russian hearts, for one man\r\nalone in Russia the festivity was not a festivity. That man was the\r\nczar himself, the creator of the happiness of many millions of Russians\r\nand the cause of the rejoicings. The emperor did not doubt the sincere\r\naffection of the people towards him; he knew and felt that Russia loved\r\nher czar with all her soul; but at the same time he knew and felt, that\r\nin spite of all the glory of his reign, in spite of the great measures he\r\nhad accomplished, the Russian land bore a handful of malcontents, whose\r\ndesigns it was beyond the power of anyone to arrest.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [1881 A.D.]]\r\n\r\nThe fatal 13th of March, 1881, came. About one o’clock in the afternoon\r\nthe emperor drove in a carriage from the Winter Palace in St. Petersburg,\r\naccompanied by his usual escort, to the Michael riding school to assist\r\nat a grand military parade, appointed to take place that day. Coming\r\nout of the riding school at the end of the parade, at about a quarter\r\nto three, and learning that the grand duke Michael Nikolaivitch, who\r\nwas present at the parade intended to visit the grand duchess Catherine\r\nMikhailovna at the Mikhailovski palace, the emperor proposed to his\r\nbrother that they should go together. After spending about half an hour\r\nat the Mikhailovski palace the emperor came out alone, without the grand\r\nduke and told the coachman to “drive home by the same way.” The carriage\r\nset off along the Catherine canal, in the direction of the Theatre bridge.\r\n\r\nAt three o’clock in the afternoon, at a distance of about 50 sajens from\r\nthe corner of the Engineer street, the emperor’s carriage as it drove\r\nalong the side of the canal, past the garden of the Mikhailovski palace\r\ncame alongside a young man at the footpath of the canal; he afterwards\r\nturned out to be the citizen Nicholas Ivanovitch Rissakov. When he came\r\non a line with the imperial carriage, Rissakov turned his face towards\r\nit, and before the escort could notice anything, quickly threw beneath\r\nthe feet of the horses harnessed to the carriage, something white like\r\nsnow, which afterwards turned out to be an explosive instrument wrapped\r\nup in a handkerchief. At the same instant a deafening crash, like a salvo\r\nof artillery, resounded; two Cossacks riding behind the czar’s equipage\r\nfell from their horses wounded, and a fourteen year old peasant boy,\r\nmortally wounded, lay groaning on the pavement; a thick cloud of snow and\r\nsplinters filled the air. The emperor’s carriage appeared much damaged\r\nby the explosion, all the four windows and the little glass behind were\r\nbroken, the frame of the door was splintered at the side and back, the\r\nside of the carriage was broken and the bottom seriously injured. When he\r\nhad thrown the explosive instrument under the carriage, Rissakov began\r\nto run off in the direction of the Nevski Prospect, but at a few sajens\r\nfrom the spot where the explosion had taken place, he slipped, fell, and\r\nwas seized by some soldiers who came up. The emperor himself was entirely\r\nuninjured. He ordered the coachman to stop the horses, opened the left\r\ndoor, got out of the carriage, and went to the spot where Rissakov was\r\nalready surrounded by a crowd of people.\r\n\r\nThen, when the emperor, desiring to examine the spot where the explosion\r\nhad taken place, had left Rissakov, and had made a few steps along the\r\npathway of the canal, another man--who turned out to be a Pole named\r\nGrinevetzki--waiting till the emperor was at a distance of two arskins\r\nfrom him, raised his arms and threw something on the footpath at the\r\nvery feet of the emperor. At the same moment, not more than four or\r\nfive minutes after the first explosion, another deafening explosion was\r\nheard, after which a mass of smoke, snow and scraps of clothing enveloped\r\neverything for some moments. When the column of smoke dispersed, to the\r\nstricken gaze of the spectators a truly awful sight was presented: about\r\ntwenty men more or less severely wounded by the two explosions lay on the\r\npavement, and amongst them was the emperor. Leaning his back against the\r\nrailing of the canal, without his cap or riding cloak, half sitting on\r\nthe footpath, was the monarch; he was covered with blood and breathing\r\nwith difficulty; the bare legs of the august martyr were both broken, the\r\nblood flowed copiously from them, and his face was covered with blood.\r\nThe cap and cloak that had fallen from the emperor’s head and shoulders,\r\nand of which there remained but blood-stained and burnt fragments, lay\r\nbeside him.\r\n\r\nAt the sight of such an unexpected, such an incredible disaster, not\r\nonly the uninjured, but also the sufferers from the explosion rushed\r\nto the emperor’s help. Raising the wounded emperor, who was already\r\nlosing consciousness, the persons who surrounded him, with the grand\r\nduke Michael, who had arrived on the spot, carried him to the sledge\r\nof Colonel Dvorginski, who had been following the emperor’s equipage.\r\nLeaning over the emperor’s shoulder, the grand duke inquired if he\r\nheard, to which the emperor replied, “I hear,” and then in answer to the\r\nquestion of how he felt the emperor said: “Quicker ... to the palace,”\r\nand then as if answering the proposal to take him to the nearest house\r\nto get help, the emperor said, “Take me to the palace to die ... there.”\r\nThese were the last words of the dying monarch, heard by an eye-witness\r\nof the awful crime of the 13th of March. After this the emperor was\r\nplaced in Colonel Dvorginzki’s sledge and transported to the Winter\r\nPalace. When the palace was reached the emperor was already unconscious,\r\nand at 25 minutes of 4 o’clock Alexander II was no more.\r\n\r\nThe emperor Alexander II was great not only as the czar of a nation of\r\nmany millions, but by a life devoted to the welfare of his subjects;\r\nhe was great as the incarnation of goodness, love and clemency. The\r\nautocratic monarch of one of the vastest empires of the world, this czar\r\nwas governed in all his actions by the dictates of his loving heart.\r\nShowing himself a great example of self-sacrificing human love, he lived\r\nonly in order to exalt the land of Russia, to alleviate the necessities\r\nand consolidate the welfare of his people.[d]\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES\r\n\r\n[69] [A district containing several villages.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII. REACTION, EXPANSION, AND THE WAR WITH JAPAN\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [1881-1904 A.D.]]\r\n\r\nIn the history of Russia the period extending from 1882 to 1902 was much\r\nless eventful than the thirty years immediately preceding. The reign of\r\nAlexander II had been a time of important administrative reforms and\r\nof great economic, social, and intellectual changes in the life of the\r\nnation. Serfage had been abolished, the emancipated peasantry had been\r\nmade communal proprietors of the soil, a democratic system of rural and\r\nmunicipal self-government for local affairs had been introduced, the\r\ntribunals of all degrees had been radically reorganised, means had been\r\ntaken for developing more energetically the vast natural resources of\r\nthe country, public instruction had received an unprecedented impetus, a\r\nconsiderable amount of liberty had been accorded to the press, a liberal\r\nspirit had been suddenly evoked and had spread rapidly among all sections\r\nof the educated classes, a new imaginative and critical literature\r\ndealing largely with economic, philosophical, and social questions\r\nhad sprung into existence, and for a time the young generation fondly\r\nimagined that Russia, awakening from her traditional lethargy, was about\r\nto overtake, and soon to surpass, on the paths of national progress, the\r\nmore advanced nations of western Europe.\r\n\r\nThese sanguine expectations were not fully realised. The economic and\r\nmoral condition of the peasantry was not much improved, and in many\r\ndistricts there were signs of positive impoverishment and demoralisation.\r\nLocal self-government, after a short period of feverish and not always\r\nwell-directed activity, showed symptoms of organic exhaustion. The\r\nreformed tribunals, though incomparably better than their predecessors,\r\ndid not give universal satisfaction. In the imperial administration the\r\ncorruption and long-established abuses which had momentarily vanished\r\nbegan to reappear. Industrial enterprises did not always succeed.\r\nEducation produced many unforeseen and undesirable practical results.\r\nThe liberty of the press not unfrequently degenerated into license.\r\nThe liberal spirit, which had at first confined itself to demanding\r\nfeasible reforms, soon soared into the region of socialistic dreaming and\r\nrevolutionary projects.\r\n\r\nIn short, it became only too evident that there was no royal road to\r\nnational prosperity, and that Russia, like other nations, must be content\r\nto advance slowly and laboriously along the rough path of painful\r\nexperience. In these circumstances sanguine enthusiasm naturally gave way\r\nto despondency, and the reforming zeal of the government was replaced by\r\ntendencies of a decidedly reactionary kind. Already in the last years\r\nof the reign of Alexander II, these tendencies had found expression in\r\nukases and ministerial circulars, and zealous liberalism was more and\r\nmore discountenanced in the official world. Partly from a feeling of\r\ndespondency, and partly from a conviction that the country required\r\nrest in order to judge the practical results of the reforms already\r\naccomplished, the czar refrained from initiating any new legislation of\r\nan important kind, and the government gave it to be understood that the\r\nperiod of radical reforms was closed.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [1881 A.D.]]\r\n\r\nIn the younger ranks of the educated classes this state of things\r\nhad produced much dissatisfaction, which soon found expression in\r\nrevolutionary agitation. At first the agitation was of an academic\r\ncharacter, and was dealt with by the press censure, but it gradually\r\ntook the form of secret associations, and the police had to interfere.\r\nThere were no great, well-organised secret societies, but there were\r\nmany small groups, composed chiefly of male and female students of the\r\nuniversities and technical schools, which worked independently for a\r\ncommon purpose. That purpose was the overthrow of the existing régime and\r\nthe reorganisation of society on collectivist principles. Finding that\r\nthe walls of autocracy could not be overturned by blasts of revolutionary\r\ntrumpets, the young enthusiasts determined to seek the support of the\r\nmasses, or, as they termed it, “to go in among the people” (_idti v\r\nnarod_). Under the guise of doctors, midwives, teachers, governesses,\r\nfactory hands, or common labourers, they sought to make proselytes among\r\nthe peasantry and the workmen in the industrial centres by revolutionary\r\npamphlets and oral explanations.\r\n\r\nFor a time the propaganda had very little success, because the uneducated\r\npeasants and factory workers could not easily understand the phraseology\r\nand principles of scientific socialism; but when the propagandists\r\ndescended to a lower platform and spread rumours that the czar had given\r\nall the land to the peasants, and that the proprietors were preventing\r\nhis benevolent intentions from being carried into effect, there was a\r\nserious danger of agrarian disturbances, and energetic measures were\r\nadopted by the authorities. Wholesale arrests were made by the police,\r\nand many of the accused were imprisoned or exiled to distant provinces,\r\nsome by the regular judicial procedure, and others by so-called\r\n“administrative procedure,” without trial. The activity of the police\r\nand the sufferings of the victims naturally produced intense excitement\r\nand bitterness among those who escaped, and a secret body calling itself\r\nthe executive committee announced in its clandestinely printed organs\r\nthat those who distinguished themselves by endeavouring to suppress the\r\npropaganda would be removed. A number of officials had been condemned to\r\ndeath by this secret terrorist tribunal, and in some cases its sentences\r\nwere carried out. As these terrorist measures had quite the opposite of\r\nthe desired effect, repeated attempts had been made on the life of the\r\nemperor. At last, on the 13th of March, 1881, the carefully-laid plans of\r\nthe conspirators, [as related in the last chapter], were successful.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE REACTIONARY POLICY UNDER ALEXANDER III\r\n\r\nFinding repressive police measures insufficient to suppress the\r\nrevolutionary movement, Alexander II had entertained the idea of giving\r\na certain satisfaction to moderate liberal opinion without restricting\r\nhis autocratic power. With this object in view he had appointed General\r\nLoris-Melikov, who was credited with liberal views, minister of the\r\ninterior, and on the morning of his death he had signed a ukase creating\r\nseveral commissions, composed of high official personages and eminent\r\nprivate individuals, who should prepare reforms in various branches of\r\nthe administration.\r\n\r\nHis son and successor Alexander III (1881-94), who had never shown much\r\nsympathy with liberalism in any form, entered frankly on a reactionary\r\npolicy, which was pursued consistently during the whole of his reign.\r\nHe could not, of course, undo the great reforms of his predecessor,\r\nbut he amended them in such a way as to counteract what he considered\r\nthe exaggerations of liberalism. Local self-government in the village\r\ncommunes, the rural districts, and the towns was carefully restricted,\r\nand placed to a greater extent under the control of the regular officials.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ALEXANDER III\r\n\r\n(1845-1894)]\r\n\r\nThe reformers of the previous reign had endeavoured to make the\r\nemancipated peasantry administratively and economically independent of\r\nthe landed proprietors; the conservatives of this later era, proceeding\r\non the assumption that the peasants did not know how to make a proper\r\nuse of the liberty prematurely conferred upon them, endeavoured to\r\nre-establish the influence of the landed proprietors by appointing from\r\namongst them “land-chiefs,” who were to exercise over the peasants\r\nof their district a certain amount of patriarchal jurisdiction. The\r\nreformers of the previous reign had sought to make the new local\r\nadministration (_zemstvo_) a system of genuine rural self-government and\r\na basis for future parliamentary institutions; these later conservatives\r\ntransformed it into a mere branch of the ordinary state administration,\r\nand took precautions against its ever assuming a political character.\r\nEven municipal institutions, which had never shown much vitality, were\r\nsubjected to similar restrictions. In short, the various forms of local\r\nself-government, which were intended to raise the nation gradually to the\r\nhigher political level of western Europe, were condemned as unsuited to\r\nthe national character and traditions, and as productive of disorder and\r\ndemoralisation. They were accordingly replaced in great measure by the\r\nold autocratic methods of administration, and much of the administrative\r\ncorruption which had been cured, or at least repressed, by the reform\r\nenthusiasm again flourished luxuriantly.\r\n\r\nIn a small but influential section of the educated classes there was\r\na conviction that the revolutionary tendencies, which culminated in\r\nnihilism and anarchism, proceeded from the adoption of cosmopolitan\r\nrather than national principles in all spheres of educational and\r\nadministrative activity, and that the best remedy for the evils from\r\nwhich the country was suffering was to be found in a return to the three\r\ngreat principles of nationality, orthodoxy, and autocracy. This doctrine,\r\nwhich had been invented by the Slavophils of a previous generation, was\r\nearly instilled into the mind of Alexander III by Pobiedonostsev, who\r\nwas one of his teachers, and later his most trusted adviser, and its\r\ninfluence can be traced in all the more important acts of the government\r\nduring that monarch’s reign. His determination to maintain autocracy was\r\nofficially proclaimed a few days after his accession. Nationality and\r\neastern orthodoxy, which are so closely connected as to be almost blended\r\ntogether in the Russian mind, received not less attention.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE RUSSIFICATION OF THE PROVINCES.\r\n\r\nEven in European Russia the regions near the frontier contain a\r\ngreat variety of nationalities, languages, and religions. In Finland\r\nthe population is composed of Finnish-speaking and Swedish-speaking\r\nProtestants; the Baltic provinces are inhabited by German-speaking,\r\nLett-speaking, and Esth-speaking Lutherans; the inhabitants of the\r\nsouthwestern provinces are chiefly Polish-speaking Roman Catholics and\r\nYiddish-speaking Jews; in the Crimea and on the middle Volga there are a\r\nconsiderable number of Tatar-speaking Mohammedans; and in the Caucasus\r\nthere is a conglomeration of races and languages such as is to be found\r\non no other portion of the earth’s surface. Until recent times these\r\nvarious nationalities were allowed to retain unmolested the language,\r\nreligion, and peculiar local administration of their ancestors, but when\r\nthe new nationality doctrine came into fashion attempts were made to\r\nspread among them the language, religion, and administrative institutions\r\nof the dominant race. In the reigns of Nicholas I and Alexander II\r\nthese attempts were merely occasional and intermittent; under Alexander\r\nIII they were made systematically and with very little consideration\r\nfor the feelings, wishes, and interests of the people concerned. The\r\nlocal institutions were assimilated to those of the purely Russian\r\nprovinces; the use of the Russian language was made obligatory in the\r\nadministration, in the tribunals, and to some extent in the schools;\r\nthe spread of eastern orthodoxy was encouraged by the authorities,\r\nwhilst the other confessions were placed under severe restrictions;\r\nforeigners were prohibited from possessing landed property, and in some\r\nprovinces administrative measures were taken for making the land pass\r\ninto the hands of orthodox Russians. In this process some of the local\r\nofficials displayed probably an amount of zeal beyond the intentions of\r\nthe government, but any attempt to oppose the movement was rigorously\r\npunished.\r\n\r\nOf all the various races the Jews were the most severely treated.\r\nThe great majority of them had long been confined to the western and\r\nsouthwestern provinces. In the rest of the country they had not been\r\nallowed to reside in the villages, because their habits of keeping\r\nvodka-shops and lending money at usurious interest were found to\r\ndemoralise the peasantry, and even in the towns their number and\r\noccupations had been restricted by the authorities. But, partly from the\r\nusual laxity of the administration and partly from the readiness of the\r\nJews to conciliate the needy officials, the rules had been by no means\r\nstrictly applied. As soon as this fact became known to Alexander III he\r\nordered the rules to be strictly carried out, without considering what an\r\nenormous amount of hardship and suffering such an order entailed. He also\r\ncaused new rules to be enacted by which his Jewish subjects were heavily\r\nhandicapped in education and professional advancement. In short, complete\r\nrussification of all non-Russian populations and institutions was the\r\nchief aim of the government in home affairs.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOREIGN POLICY; THE FRENCH ALLIANCE\r\n\r\nIn the foreign policy of the empire Alexander III likewise introduced\r\nconsiderable changes. During his father’s reign its main objects were: in\r\nthe west, the maintenance of the alliance with Germany; in southeastern\r\nEurope, the recovery of what had been lost by the Crimean war, the\r\ngradual weakening of the sultan’s authority, and the increase of Russian\r\ninfluence among the minor slav nationalities; in Asia, the gradual but\r\ncautious expansion of Russian domination. In the reign of Alexander III\r\nthe first of these objects was abandoned. Already, before his accession,\r\nthe bonds of friendship which united Russia to Germany had been weakened\r\nby the action of Bismarck in giving to the cabinet of St. Petersburg at\r\nthe Berlin congress less diplomatic support than was expected, and by the\r\nAustro-German treaty of alliance (October, 1879), concluded avowedly for\r\nthe purpose of opposing Russian aggression; but the old relations were\r\npartly re-established by secret negotiations in 1880, by a meeting of the\r\nyoung czar and the old emperor at Dantzic in 1881, and by the meeting of\r\nthe three emperors at Skiernewice in 1884, by which the Three Emperors’\r\nLeague was reconstituted for a term of three years.\r\n\r\nGradually, however, a great change took place in the czar’s views with\r\nregard to the German alliance. He suspected Bismarck of harbouring\r\nhostile designs against Russia, and he came to recognise that the\r\npermanent weakening of France was not in accordance with Russian\r\npolitical interests. He determined, therefore, to oppose any further\r\ndisturbance of the balance of power in favour of Germany, and when the\r\ntreaty of Skiernewice expired in 1887, he declined to renew it. From that\r\ntime Russia gravitated slowly towards an alliance with France, and sought\r\nto create a counterpoise against the Triple Alliance of Germany, Austria,\r\nand Italy. The czar was reluctant to bind himself by a formal treaty,\r\nbecause the French government did not offer the requisite guarantees\r\nof stability, and because he feared that it might be induced, by the\r\nprospects of Russian support, to assume an aggressive attitude towards\r\nGermany. He recognised, however, that in the event of a great European\r\nwar the two nations would in all probability be found fighting on the\r\nsame side, and that if they made no preparations for concerted military\r\naction they would be placed at a grave disadvantage in comparison with\r\ntheir opponents of the Triple Alliance, who were believed to have already\r\nworked out an elaborate plan of campaign. In view of this contingency the\r\nRussian and French military authorities studied the military questions\r\nin common, and the result of their labours was the preparation of a\r\nmilitary convention, which was finally ratified in 1894. During this\r\nperiod the relations between the two governments and the two countries\r\nbecame much more cordial. In the summer of 1891 the visit to Kronstad\r\nof a French squadron under Admiral Gervais was made the occasion for an\r\nenthusiastic demonstration in favour of a Franco-Russian alliance; and\r\ntwo years later (October, 1893) a still more enthusiastic reception was\r\ngiven to the Russian admiral Avelan and his officers when they visited\r\nToulon and Paris. But it was not till after the death of Alexander III\r\nthat the word “alliance” was used publicly by official personages. In\r\n1895 the term was first publicly employed by Ribot, then president of the\r\ncouncil, in the chamber of deputies, but the expressions he used were so\r\nvague that they did not entirely remove the prevailing doubts as to the\r\nexistence of a formal treaty. Two years later (August, 1897), during the\r\nofficial visit of President Félix Faure to St. Petersburg, a little more\r\nlight was thrown on the subject. In the complimentary speeches delivered\r\nby the president of the French Republic and the czar, France and Russia\r\nwere referred to as allies, and the term _nations alliées_ was afterwards\r\nrepeatedly used on occasions of a similar kind.\r\n\r\nIn southeastern Europe Alexander III adopted an attitude of reserve and\r\nexpectancy. He greatly increased and strengthened his Black Sea fleet,\r\nso as to be ready for any emergency that might arise, and in June, 1886,\r\ncontrary to the declaration made in the Treaty of Berlin (Article 59),\r\nhe ordered Batum to be transformed into a fortified naval port, but in\r\nthe Balkan Peninsula he persistently refrained, under a good deal of\r\nprovocation, from any intervention that might lead to a European war.\r\nThe Bulgarian government, first under Prince Alexander and afterwards\r\nunder the direction of Stambolov, pursued systematically an anti-Russian\r\npolicy, but the cabinet of St. Petersburg confined itself officially to\r\nbreaking off diplomatic relations and making diplomatic protests, and\r\nunofficially to giving tacit encouragement to revolutionary agitation.\r\nIn Asia, during the reign of Alexander III, the expansion of Russian\r\ndomination made considerable progress.[b]\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CONQUEST OF THE TEKKE-TURCOMANS (1877-1881 A.D.)\r\n\r\nTranscaspia is the official name given to the territory east of the\r\nCaspian which was annexed by Russia in 1881 shortly after the accession\r\nof Alexander III. The country was inhabited by the Turcomans--a branch of\r\nthe Turkish race--who have been identified with the old Parthians. They\r\nwere a brave but wild and lawless people, bands of whom would frequently\r\nsweep down upon a peaceful village, kill the men, and carry off the\r\nwomen and children to be sold as slaves in Bokhara and Khiva. Whole\r\nvillages were sometimes wiped out in this way. The marauding raids of the\r\nTurcomans were a constant menace to the northern frontier of Persia and\r\nwe frequently find the Persians engaged in war with them. The great Nadir\r\nShah was himself a Turcoman. In 1861 the Persians had made a final attack\r\non the Turcomans or Tekkes, as they are commonly called, and defeated\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nThe Russian conquest of the Central Asian khanates, however, materially\r\naltered the situation of these nomadic robbers; they could no longer sell\r\nslaves in Bokhara, as the Russian laws forbade slavery, neither could\r\nthey carry on their depredations in lands guarded by the Russians, hence\r\nthey turned to Persia and offered her their allegiance in return for her\r\nsupport against these civilised intruders. But they were now a serious\r\nobstacle in the way of these same Russians. Caravans from Bokhara and\r\nthe East, to reach the Caspian, had to cross the Turcoman desert or else\r\nmake a long detour to the north, and these plundering tribes seriously\r\ninterfered with commerce.\r\n\r\nIn 1877 General Lomakin was sent against the Tekkes, but the\r\nRusso-Turkish war intervened before he had accomplished anything. In 1878\r\nLomakin attacked Dengil Teppe, was defeated by the Tekkes, and forced to\r\nretreat. The natives were greatly encouraged by this victory, their raids\r\nincreased, and they tried to stir up the Bokharans and Khivans to revolt.\r\nThe Russians now undertook more vigorous measures. General Skobelev was\r\nput in charge of the campaign, a portable railway was started from the\r\nshores of the Caspian towards the Amu Daria, a large force of artillery\r\nwas conveyed to the front, and a water distillery--of the greatest\r\nservice in this waterless region--was established at Krasnovodsk. Colonel\r\nKuropatkin, who had been on Skobelev’s staff in the Russo-Turkish war,\r\ncame by forced marches to assist his former chief.\r\n\r\nThe Turcomans were intrenched in three camps--Yangi Kala, Dangil Teppe,\r\nand Geok Teppe. The Russians began the main attack on January 1st, 1881,\r\ncharging first upon Yangi Kala. The Tekkes fought with the greatest\r\nbravery, but the Russian artillery forced them to evacuate. The Turcoman\r\nsorties were made usually a little after sunset and the attacks were\r\nexceedingly fierce. The Tekkes had their wives and children in camp\r\nwith them, huddled in their felt tents, and their sufferings under the\r\ncontinual artillery fire must have been terrible. Finally upon January\r\n24th, after three weeks of fighting, the Russians were successful, the\r\nTekkes were routed with great loss to both Russians and Turcomans. There\r\nare different estimates given as the total number killed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CATHEDRAL OF THE ARCHANGEL MICHAEL]\r\n\r\nBeveridge’s[c] figures, given below, cannot be far from right. He uses\r\nthis siege to illustrate the Russian method of conquest. Their method,\r\nhe says, “is to wage war while war exists and to employ the methods of\r\npeace only when war is over. Skobelev at Geok Teppe refused to accept\r\nthe surrender of the heroic Tekkes who had terrorised Central Asia for\r\ncenturies, and he slaughtered more than twenty thousand men, women and\r\nchildren in twenty days. It seemed quite terrible and was as terrible\r\nas it seemed; but it is hard to see that it is much worse to destroy\r\n20,000 men, women, and children and secure peace for all time than it\r\nis to kill that number during twenty years and in the process increase\r\nthe irritation, the disorder, and the feud. For from the red day of\r\nGeok Teppe to this hour, order, law, safety to travellers, security of\r\ncommerce and all other things which help to make up civilisation have\r\nexisted in Central Asia, as firmly guarded as they are in the United\r\nStates. War is bad under any circumstances, but if it must be it should\r\nbe thorough, that it may be brief and not fruitless.”\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [1885-1894 A.D.]]\r\n\r\nAfter calling attention to the efficacy of this method in Manchuria\r\nduring the Boxer movement, the author continues: “It is worth the\r\nattention of all men that when Russia has once inflicted her punishment\r\nthere has seldom been any recurrence of insurrection. Where Russian law\r\nand order and system have been established they have remained, upheld not\r\nby the bayonets of the soldiers who established them, but by the hands\r\nof the very people among whom and against whose resistance they were\r\nplanted. Among all the defects of Russian civilisation, its virtues are\r\nstriking and elemental, and one of the chief of them is stability.”\r\n\r\nThe country of the Turcomans thus conquered was annexed to the Russian\r\nEmpire, the final annexation of Merv taking place in 1884.[a] Alexander\r\nIII then allowed the military authorities to push forward in the\r\ndirection of Afghanistan, until in March, 1885, an engagement took place\r\nbetween Russian and Afghan forces at Penjdeh. Thereupon the British\r\ngovernment, which had been for some time carrying on negotiations with\r\nthe cabinet of St. Petersburg for a delimitation of the Russo-Afghan\r\nfrontier, intervened energetically and prepared for war; but a compromise\r\nwas effected, and after more than two years of negotiation a delimitation\r\nconvention was signed at St. Petersburg on July 20th, 1887. The forward\r\nmovement of Russia was thus stopped in the direction of Herat, but it\r\ncontinued with great activity farther east in the region of the Pamir,\r\nuntil another Anglo-Russian convention was signed in 1895. During the\r\nwhole reign of Alexander III the increase of territory in central Asia is\r\ncalculated by Russian authorities at 429,895 square kilometres.\r\n\r\n\r\nACCESSION OF NICHOLAS II (1894 A.D.)\r\n\r\nOn November 1st, 1894, Alexander III died, and was succeeded by his\r\nson, Nicholas II, who, partly from similarity of character and partly\r\nfrom veneration for his father’s memory, continued the existing lines\r\nof policy in home and foreign affairs. The expectation entertained in\r\nmany quarters that great legislative changes would at once be made in a\r\nliberal sense was not realised. When an influential deputation from the\r\nprovince of Tver, which had long enjoyed a reputation for liberalism,\r\nventured to hint in a loyal address that the time had come for changes\r\nin the existing autocratic régime they received a reply which showed\r\nthat the emperor had no intention of making any such changes. Private\r\nsuggestions in the same sense, offered directly and respectfully, were no\r\nbetter received and no important changes were made in the legislation of\r\nthe preceding reign. But a great alteration took place noiselessly in the\r\nmanner of carrying out the laws and ministerial circulars.\r\n\r\nThough resembling his father in the main points of his character, the\r\nyoung czar was of a more humane disposition, and he was much less of\r\na doctrinaire. With his father’s aspiration of making holy Russia a\r\nhomogeneous empire he thoroughly sympathised in principle, but he\r\ndisliked the systematic persecution of Jews, heretics, and schismatics\r\nto which it gave rise, and he let it be understood, without any formal\r\norder or proclamation, that the severe measures hitherto employed would\r\nnot meet with his approval. The officials were not slow to take the hint,\r\nand their undue zeal at once disappeared. Nicholas II showed, however,\r\nthat his father’s policy of russification was neither to be reversed nor\r\nto be abandoned. When an influential deputation was sent from Finland\r\nto St. Petersburg to represent to him respectfully that the officials\r\nwere infringing the local rights and privileges solemnly accorded at\r\nthe time of the annexation, it was refused an audience, and the leaders\r\nof the movement were informed indirectly that local interests must be\r\nsubordinated to the general welfare of the empire. In accordance with\r\nthis declaration, the policy of russification in Finland was steadily\r\nmaintained and caused much disappointment, not only to the Finlanders,\r\nbut also to the other nationalities who desired the preservation of their\r\nancient rights.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [1895-1896 A.D.]]\r\n\r\nIn foreign affairs Nicholas II likewise continued the policy of his\r\npredecessor, with certain modifications suggested by the change of\r\ncircumstances. He strengthened the cordial understanding with France by\r\na formal agreement, the terms of which were not divulged, but he never\r\nencouraged the French government in any aggressive designs, and he\r\nmaintained friendly relations with Germany. In the Balkan Peninsula a\r\nslight change of attitude took place. Alexander III, indignant at what\r\nhe considered the ingratitude of the Slav nationalities, remained coldly\r\naloof, as far as possible, from all intervention in their affairs. About\r\nthree months after his death, De Giers, who thoroughly approved of this\r\nattitude, died (January 26th, 1895), and his successor, Prince Lobanov,\r\nminister of foreign affairs from March 19th, 1895, to August 30th, 1896,\r\nendeavoured to recover what he considered Russia’s legitimate influence\r\nin the Slav world.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: COUNT LYEFF TOLSTOI\r\n\r\n(1828-)]\r\n\r\nFor this purpose Russian diplomacy became more active in southeastern\r\nEurope. The result was perceived first in Montenegro and Servia, and\r\nthen in Bulgaria. Prince Ferdinand of Bulgaria had long been anxious\r\nto legalise his position by a reconciliation, and as soon as he got\r\nrid of Stambulov he made advances to the Russian government. They were\r\nwell received, and a reconciliation was effected on certain conditions,\r\nthe first of which was that Prince Ferdinand’s eldest son and heir\r\nshould become a member of the Eastern orthodox church. As another means\r\nof opposing Western influence in southeastern Europe, Prince Lobanov\r\ninclined to the policy of protecting rather than weakening the Ottoman\r\nempire. When the British government seemed disposed to use coercive\r\nmeasures for the protection of the Armenians, he gave it clearly to be\r\nunderstood that any such proceeding would be opposed by Russia.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [1897 A.D.]]\r\n\r\nAfter Prince Lobanov’s death and the appointment of Count Muraviev as\r\nhis successor in January, 1897, this tendency of Russian policy became\r\nless marked. In April, 1897, it is true, when the Greeks provoked a\r\nwar with Turkey, they received no support from St. Petersburg, but at\r\nthe close of the war the czar showed himself more friendly to them;\r\nand afterwards, when it proved extremely difficult to find a suitable\r\nperson as governor-general of Crete he recommended the appointment of\r\nhis cousin, Prince George of Greece--a selection which was pretty sure\r\nto accelerate the union of the island with the Hellenic kingdom. How far\r\nthe recommendation was due to personal feeling, as opposed to political\r\nconsiderations, it is impossible to say.\r\n\r\nIn Asia, after the accession of Nicholas II the expansion of Russia,\r\nfollowing the line of least resistance and stimulated by the construction\r\nof the Siberian railway, was effected at the expense of China. As a\r\nnecessary basis for a strong foreign policy the army was systematically\r\nstrengthened. At one moment the schemes for military reorganisation\r\ninvolved such an enormous expenditure that the czar conceived the idea of\r\nan agreement among the great powers to arrest the increase of national\r\narmaments. The idea was communicated to the powers somewhat abruptly by\r\nCount Muraviev, Prince Lobanov’s successor in the direction of foreign\r\naffairs, and an international conference was held at the Hague to discuss\r\nthe subject; but it had very little practical result, and certainly did\r\nnot attain the primary object in view. [Its final act is given in the\r\nappendix to this volume.]\r\n\r\nA sketch of the recent history of Russia, however brief, would be\r\nincomplete without some mention of the remarkable industrial progress\r\nmade during the period under consideration. Protected by high tariffs and\r\nfostered by the introduction of foreign capital, Russian manufacturing\r\nindustry made enormous strides. By way of illustration a few figures may\r\nbe cited. In the space of ten years (1887-1897) the number of workers\r\nemployed in the various branches of industrial enterprise rose from\r\n1,318,048 to 2,098,262. The consumption of cotton for spinning purposes,\r\nwhich was only 117 million kilograms in 1886, was 257 millions in 1898,\r\nand the number of spindles, according to the weekly journal _Russia_ of\r\nAugust 2nd, 1902, was estimated at that date at 6,970,000. Thanks chiefly\r\nto this growth of the cotton industry, the town of Lódz, which was little\r\nmore than a big village in 1875, has now a population of over 300,000.\r\nThe iron, steel, and petroleum industries have likewise made enormous\r\nprogress. Between 1892 and 1900 the estimated value of metallic articles\r\nmanufactured in the country rose from 142 millions to 276 millions of\r\nrubles. As is generally the case in such circumstances, protection led to\r\ntemporary over-production, which brought about a financial and economic\r\ncrisis; but if we may accept certain figures given by Henry Norman,[d]\r\nthe crisis could not have been very severe, for he states that “no fewer\r\nthan 580 companies declared a dividend during the first nine months of\r\n1901, their total nominal capital being £105,000,000, and the average\r\ndividend no less than 10.1 per cent.” Much of this progress is due to the\r\nintelligence and energy of M. Witte, minister of finance.[b]\r\n\r\n\r\nKUROPATKIN ON THE RUSSIAN POLICY OF EXPANSION\r\n\r\nIn connection with the Russian advance in Asia with its climax in the war\r\nwith Japan, it may be interesting to notice an address made by General\r\nKuropatkin to a party of English tourists at Askabad in November, 1897.\r\nIts protestations of peaceful intent will come as a surprise to many who\r\nhave seen in the Russian advance only an insatiable land-hunger. General\r\nKuropatkin, whose fortune it was seven years later to command the Russian\r\narmy in the war with Japan, said in part, as quoted in a recent work:[a]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A RUSSIAN CHILD]\r\n\r\n“The policy of our government in Central Asia, since the accession of the\r\nlate czar, has been eminently one of peace; and recourse has never been\r\nhad to arms until every other means of gaining a given object had failed.\r\nThe principles which govern the policy of Russia are very simple. They\r\nare the maintenance of peace, of order, and of prosperity in all classes\r\nof the population. The means employed to compass these ends are equally\r\nfree from complexity. Those who fill responsible positions are expressly\r\ninformed by our government that the assumption of sovereignty over alien\r\nnationalities must not be attempted without very serious deliberation,\r\ninasmuch as such become, on annexation, Russian subjects, children of\r\nthe czar, and invested with every privilege enjoyed by citizens of the\r\nempire. His majesty has enjoined on his representatives, as their first\r\nduty, a fatherly care of his Asiatic subjects. In order to prevent the\r\npossibility of internal discord, we have disarmed the natives, and no\r\npains have been spared to induce them to adopt peaceful pursuits. The\r\nfruits of this action are already visible. A solitary traveller can now\r\ncross central Asia, from the Caspian to the Siberian frontier, without\r\nincurring the smallest risk of attack.\r\n\r\n“We may boast with perfect truth that the thirty-five years during which\r\ncentral Asia has enjoyed the blessings of a firm and civilised rule,\r\nhave been years of sustained progress, of daily-increasing strength in\r\nbonds of attachment and good-will, which unite these subject peoples to\r\nthe inhabitants of other Russian provinces. Between 1885 and 1888 we\r\nestablished a stable and logical frontier with the aid of Great Britain;\r\nand in the twelve years which have since elapsed there have been no\r\nexpeditions throughout its length of 600 miles bordering on Persia,\r\nand 400 on Afghanistan. The latter country contains much inflammable\r\nmaterial, but we have taken every means in our power to ensure that the\r\ninternal disorders of that state shall not react on our frontier. So\r\nscrupulous is our regard for the _status quo_, that whole tribes have\r\ncast themselves on our protection in vain.\r\n\r\n“Piruzkuhis, Khezaris, and Jamshidis have crossed our borders in troops\r\nof as many as 1,000 families, but we have always repatriated such\r\nrefugees. There have been similar cases in our dealings with Persian\r\nsubjects. Turkestan proper has been free from war since the occupation\r\nof Farghana--twenty-one years ago. The Bokhara frontier has remained\r\nintact since the capture of Samarkand in 1868. The last complication on\r\nthe Persian border dates from 1829--nearly 70 years ago. Throughout our\r\nfrontier conterminous with China we have had no disturbance for more\r\nthan a century. I am led to mention these significant facts in order to\r\nshow that our policy in Asia is essentially a peaceful one, and that we\r\nare perfectly satisfied with our present boundaries. And I may claim\r\nto speak with authority, apart from my official position, for I have\r\nbeen personally concerned in all our important military and political\r\nmovements in Central Asia since 1868, when, only twenty, I took part in\r\nstorming Samarkand.”[e]\r\n\r\n\r\nRUSSIA IN MANCHURIA\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [1900-1902 A.D.]]\r\n\r\nRussian advance in the Far East has been going on so steadily and so\r\nquietly that few realise to what an extent northeastern Asia is becoming\r\nrussianised. Russian ships are seen in Chinese and Japanese harbours,\r\nRussian banks are found on Chinese territory, Russian railways are\r\nconnecting those remote parts of the world with Europe, and, most\r\nimportant of all, Russian peasants are being landed in the Far East. The\r\nrussification movement is especially active in Manchuria, which province\r\nhas become prominent in the last few years. Although on a map of Asia\r\nManchuria does not look very large, it covers nearly as much space as\r\nFrance and Germany together. Beveridge[c] recently said of it: “It is\r\nan empire more favourably situated as to its climatic conditions than\r\nany part of Asia. It is in the same latitude as southern Canada and the\r\nnorthern portion of the United States. Its northern limits are about the\r\nsame as the northern limits of Quebec. Its southern limits are about the\r\nsame as the southern limits of Maryland. It is bounded on the north by\r\nthe richest portions of Siberia, which not many years ago was itself a\r\npart of the dominion of the Manchus; for several hundred miles on the\r\neast by the grain-fields of the Ussuri district of Russian Siberia, also\r\nuntil recently a part of the Chinese Empire; on the east and south by\r\nKorea, over which the world’s next great war will probably be fought,\r\nand soon; on the west by Mongolia, and on the south by Korea, China, and\r\nthe gulfs and extensions of the Yellow Sea, which touches or commands\r\nmuch of that empire. On these gulfs are two of the finest military and\r\ncommercial ports of Asia, or the world--Port Arthur and Talienwan, or, as\r\nthe Russians call it, Dalny.”\r\n\r\nRussian designs upon Manchuria first became prominent after the\r\nChino-Japanese war when Russia objected to Japan’s acquiring any\r\nterritory in that quarter. During the Boxer uprising in 1900 Russian\r\ntroops overran Manchuria and in a convention concluded between Russia and\r\nChina at the end of the movement, the civil and military administration\r\nof the province was placed practically under the control of Russia. Owing\r\nto objections on the part of the other powers, however, Russia withdrew\r\nthis convention and another was signed in place of it on April 8th, 1902.\r\nAccording to this Manchuria was to remain “an integral portion of the\r\nChinese Empire”; China pledged herself to protect the railway and all\r\nRussian subjects and their enterprises in Manchuria, while Russia for\r\nher part agreed to withdraw her troops gradually. This agreement on the\r\npart of Russia remained a promise only. In the meanwhile Manchuria was\r\nrapidly becoming russianised. The important cities along the railway\r\nsuch as New-Chwang, Mukden, Liauyang and Kirin became centres of Russian\r\nforces. Russian immigrants built and inhabited whole towns laid out like\r\nEuropean cities with all modern improvements. Harbin, which in 1897 was a\r\ncollection of mud huts, became a Russian city and a centre of Manchurian\r\ntrade.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE WAR WITH JAPAN\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [1903-1904 A.D.]]\r\n\r\nRussia’s policy in the Far East was the cause of friction with England\r\nand the United States, and especially with Japan; relations with the\r\nlatter becoming more and more strained until they finally led to a\r\nwar which broke out in February, 1904. In April of the preceding year\r\nRussia’s representative at Peking presented certain demands to the\r\nChinese government which virtually excluded all foreigners--except\r\nRussians--from Manchuria, and were a plain violation of the principle\r\nof the “open door” which Russia had pledged herself to maintain in\r\nthat province. Owing to the opposition of the United States and Japan,\r\nhowever, most of these demands were withdrawn and permission was granted\r\nto open two Manchurian ports, although this was not carried out. In\r\nKorea also Russia opposed Japan, refusing to allow her to open the port\r\nof Wi-ju to foreign trade, and objecting to a Japanese telegraph from\r\nSeul to Fusan, although Russia herself laid a telegraph line on Korean\r\nterritory.\r\n\r\nIn August, 1903, Russia took the important step of establishing a\r\nspecial vice-royalty in the Amur provinces which had been leased to her\r\nin the Liao-tung peninsula. Vice-admiral Alexiev was appointed as first\r\nRussian viceroy of the Far East, and was invested with civil and military\r\nauthority which made him to a great extent independent of St. Petersburg.\r\n\r\nIn September the Russian ambassador at Peking had announced that\r\nNew-Chwang and Mukden would be evacuated on October 8th, but that date\r\npassed and Russian troops were still there, while Russia continued to\r\nstrengthen her army and navy in the Far East. Japan demanded that Russia\r\nshould evacuate Manchuria in agreement with her promises and that she\r\nshould discontinue her aggressive attitude in Korea.\r\n\r\nRussia’s answers to Japan’s repeated demands were evasive, and on January\r\n8th, 1904, Japan sent a final note to Russia and, receiving no reply,\r\nwithdrew her minister and legation from St. Petersburg on February 6th,\r\n1904. On February 7th both governments issued statements announcing the\r\nseverance of diplomatic relations. On February 8th the main Japanese\r\nfleet, under Vice-admiral Togo, opened the war by surprising the Russian\r\nfleet at Port Arthur in a state of unpreparedness, and inflicting much\r\ndamage.\r\n\r\nThe attack was repeated on the following day with a repetition of the\r\nresult of the first day’s assault. On the same day Admiral Uriu and a\r\nsmall Japanese squadron attacked and destroyed two Russian cruisers in\r\nthe harbour of Chemulpo. Thus at the very outset the Japanese had secured\r\na decided advantage over their opponents on the sea. At once the cry\r\narose in Russia that Japan, by not giving official notice of the proposed\r\nattack had violated international law, but neutral nations generally\r\nsaw in Russia’s complaint only an attempt to excuse her defeats, and\r\nheld that the severing of diplomatic relations was warning enough. Still\r\nthat the Russians were not entirely crippled was shown by the fact that\r\nwithin a fortnight their squadron of four cruisers at Vladivostok cut its\r\nway out of the ice, which was supposed to hold it captive, and harried\r\nthe Japanese coast. But this danger did not hinder the transportation of\r\nJapanese troops to Korea, which began on February 18th. The following\r\nmonth saw a continuation of Japanese successes and of Russian losses.\r\nSeveral times Admiral Togo attacked Port Arthur, at one time or another\r\nalmost all of the Russian ships of war sustaining more or less serious\r\ndamage. Vladivostok was bombarded, and a succession of minor engagements\r\ntook place between the outposts of the two opposing armies advancing\r\ntoward one another from opposite sides of the Yalu river. On February\r\n24th Admiral Togo made an unsuccessful attempt to “bottle up” the Russian\r\nfleet in the harbour of Port Arthur by sinking five old steam-ships in\r\nthe channel. Early in March, General Kuropatkin, the Russian minister\r\nof war, was appointed by the czar to the supreme command of the Russian\r\narmies in Manchuria to succeed Viceroy Alexiev and Admiral Makarov was\r\nat the same time appointed to the command of the fleet. By the end of\r\nthe month the Japanese had, on the Manchurian border, in Korea, with\r\nwhich country they had concluded a close alliance, a force estimated at\r\neighty thousand, with a base at Ping Yang. This was faced by a Russian\r\nforce, slightly smaller, but increased daily by reinforcements which kept\r\narriving in a continuous stream over the Trans-Siberian and Manchurian\r\nrailways. The Japanese successes appeared well nigh to stupefy Russia,\r\nand the demoralisation of the czar’s official advisers seemed complete.\r\nBeside the loss of General Kuropatkin, who was succeeded as minister of\r\nwar by General Sakarov, both Count Lamsdorf, minister of foreign affairs,\r\nand M. Witte, the finance minister, retired from the cabinet. On April\r\n13th, the Russian battle-ship _Petropavlovsk_ struck a mine or floating\r\ntorpedo near the entrance to Port Arthur harbour and sank with all on\r\nboard, including Admiral Makarov and the war artist Vereshchagin.\r\n\r\nDuring the succeeding month war operations of importance or interest were\r\nconfined to the land. By the first of May the principal points in the\r\nJapanese military programme had unfolded themselves. The absolute command\r\nof the sea and coast, thus assuring ease and safety in the transportation\r\nof troops and munitions of war, had been secured, and an efficient and\r\nformidable army had been landed on the Asiatic mainland. Korea too had\r\nbeen thoroughly occupied. The Japanese army, in the last days of April,\r\nbegan its forward movement under General Kuroki, the purpose being\r\nto cross the Yalu at several points and drive the Russians back into\r\nManchuria.\r\n\r\nOn May 1st, after a six days fight on the Yalu near Wi-ju, the Japanese\r\nwon their first land victory, and secured a firm footing on the\r\nManchurian side of the Yalu. During the month of May Kuroki continued\r\nhis advance into the interior, but his progress was slow owing to the\r\ndifficulty in maintaining communication with the coast and constant\r\nskirmishing with the Cossacks who opposed his advance guard. Kuropatkin\r\nmeanwhile proceeded to concentrate his forces at Liauyang on the\r\nManchurian Railway south of Harbin, with the apparent intention of\r\nleaving Port Arthur to its fate.\r\n\r\nIt was about the latter place that the activity now centred and against\r\nit a second Japanese army under General Oku advanced. On May 25th Oku\r\nlanded a force of some forty thousand men near Kin-chau on the narrowest\r\npoint of the Liao-tung peninsula. At this point the Nan-shan hills\r\nextending from Kin-chau, on the western side of the isthmus toward Dalny\r\non the east afforded the Russians an excellent opportunity for defence\r\nand here they had constructed a strong line of fortifications, mounted a\r\nlarge number of guns and manned them with the flower of the Port Arthur\r\narmy. After a series of tentative attacks, Oku made a grand assault under\r\ncover of fire from warships in the harbour of Kin-chau. In the charge up\r\nthe heights he lost over 4,000 men, but drove out the Russians, who lost\r\n2,000 men and 78 cannon. Two days later the Japanese occupied Russia’s\r\ngreat commercial port, Dalny, finding the docks, piers, and railway yards\r\nuninjured. It was thenceforward the Japanese base.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [1904-1905 A.D.]]\r\n\r\nPort Arthur was now left to its fate, save for the single effort of\r\nGeneral Stakelberg who was detached with 40,000 men to make a dash\r\nsouthward, but was defeated by Oku at Telissu (Vofangow), eighty miles\r\nnorth of Port Arthur (June 14-16), and by Kuroki. He made his escape,\r\nhaving lost some 10,000 men on his vain foray.\r\n\r\nKuropatkin’s tactics were Fabian and his eventual reliance was the\r\nreinforcements which the Siberian railway poured in as fast as possible.\r\nThe Japanese forced the attack. Marshal Oyama was in charge of the armies\r\nopposed to Kuropatkin, his subordinates being Nodzu and the brilliant\r\nKuroki. General Oku also joined Oyama, the Port Arthur siege being\r\nplaced in the command of General Nogi. June 26-27 the Japanese took the\r\nwell-nigh impregnable position at Fen-shiu-ling pass. Shortly after\r\nKuroki took the important pass of Motien-ling. On July 17 General Count\r\nKeller made a desperate effort to recapture it, but was repulsed with\r\nheavy loss. July 24 Oku took Tashichiao and forced the Russians back to\r\nthe walled city of Hai-cheng. July 29 Kuroki took the Yangtse pass, in\r\nwhose defence General Keller was killed. Oku having turned his right\r\nflank, Kuropatkin was forced to evacuate Hai-cheng and retreat to his\r\nbase at Liauyang. He was also compelled to give up the important city of\r\nNew-Chwang.\r\n\r\nThe capture of Liauyang was a great problem. The Japanese were not ready\r\nto open battle till August 24, when they began a twelve days’ combat\r\nwhich takes a permanent place as one of the largest and fiercest battles\r\nin history. The Russians were estimated at 200,000; the Japanese at\r\n240,000. The Japanese confessed a loss of 25,000; the Russian loss was\r\nperhaps still greater, as they were defeated and escaped capture or\r\nannihilation only by Kuropatkin’s ingenuity in retreat.\r\n\r\nThe Russians retired to Mukden. October 2nd Kuropatkin felt strong enough\r\nto take the offensive, and assailed Oyama on the river Shakhe or the\r\nSha-ho. A series of battles followed, lasting till October 18, when the\r\nRussians fell back again to Mukden, after a loss of 45,000 men killed and\r\nwounded, according to a Russian staff report. Oyama claimed to have found\r\n13,300 Russians dead on the field, and admitted a loss of 15,800 on his\r\nown side.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Port Arthur was undergoing one of the most important sieges in\r\nhistory. The siege began on May 26th, when Nan-shan hill was taken and\r\nDalny occupied, though on August 12th the last of the outlying defences\r\nwas taken and the Japanese sat down before the permanent works. They\r\ncombined a patient and scientific process of sapping, trenching and\r\ntunnelling, with a series of six grand assaults. The collaboration of\r\nsuch skill with such reckless heroism had its inevitable result. The\r\ngarrison under General Stoessel held out with splendid courage against an\r\narmy totalling perhaps 100,000, but the gradual exhaustion of ammunition,\r\nfood, and strength, together with the appearance of scurvy, compelled a\r\nsurrender. January 3rd, 1905, the Japanese took possession, finding 878\r\nofficers, 23,491 men, besides several thousand non-combatants.\r\n\r\nThe fleet which had made several efforts to escape had been reduced by\r\nloss after loss, and finally, on the capture of 203 Metre Hill, had been\r\nsubjected to the fire of the land artillery and completely destroyed.\r\n\r\nDuring the leaguer of Port Arthur and the gradual beating back of\r\nKuropatkin, other Russian activities kept diplomacy busy. The seizure of\r\nneutral ships in the Red Sea by two vessels that passed the Dardanelles\r\nas merchantmen and then equipped as cruisers, provoked such indignation\r\nin England and Germany that the seizures were discontinued. The\r\nVladivostok squadron made daring raids upon Japanese and neutral vessels,\r\nbut after a long pursuit was caught by Admiral Kamimura, who sank the\r\nRuric and crippled the other two cruisers.\r\n\r\nMuch talk was made of sending the powerful Baltic fleet to the aid of\r\nPort Arthur under the command of Admiral Rojestvensky. It set forth\r\nin October after infinite delays. On the night of the 21st, while in\r\nthe North Sea, off the Dogger Bank, it met a fleet of British fishing\r\nsmacks and fired on it, sinking one boat and killing two fishermen. The\r\nindignation of the English people was intense, an inquiry was demanded,\r\nduring the progress of which the Baltic fleet continued on its long\r\nvoyage.\r\n\r\nThe internal condition of Russia was rendered critical by the war, and\r\nby profound commercial distress. June 15th the Governor-General over\r\nFinland, Bobrikov, was assassinated by an opponent of the russification\r\npolicy. On July 29th the Czar’s minister of the interior, Von Plehve, was\r\nslain by a bomb thrown at his carriage. Rightly or wrongly, Von Plehve\r\nwas considered the special author and adviser of the increasing vigour\r\nand tyranny of the czar’s internal administration. Jews abhorred him as\r\nthe man responsible for the Kishinev massacres, and the Finns looked upon\r\nhim as the destroyer of their national institutions. He was succeeded\r\nby Prince Peter Sviatopolk-Mirsky, a man of comparatively liberal and\r\nprogressive views.\r\n\r\nThis gave some encouragement to the zemstvos, the farthest step toward\r\nrepresentative government yet taken in Russia. They date only from the\r\nczar’s ukase of January, 1864. Each of the districts in which Russia is\r\ndivided is represented by an assembly, elected by the three estates,\r\ncommunes, municipalities, and landowners. Each district assembly in a\r\nprovince sends delegates to a general provincial assembly or zemstvo,\r\nwhich body controls the roads, primary schools, etc. Alexander II meant\r\nthat these zemstvos should acquire large power, but after his death they\r\nfell under the sway of provincial governors. November 21st, 1904, the\r\nzemstvos lifted their heads again, and their presidents met in a congress\r\nwhich, by a majority of 105 to 3, voted to beg the czar to grant Russia a\r\nconstitution and a genuine representative government.\r\n\r\nThe czar, with some asperity of tone, refused a constitution, and while\r\npromising certain reforms, rebuked the zemstvos and forbade their further\r\ndiscussion of such unsettling topics. Prince Sviatopolk-Mirsky now\r\nresigned, declaring that Russia was on the brink of a great revolution,\r\nand that the bureaucracy must be supplanted by “the freely elected\r\nrepresentatives of the people.” In January, 1905, Sergius de Witte\r\nsucceeded to the office of minister of the interior. One of the most\r\nprominent European statesmen, a liberal, and an enemy of Von Plehve, his\r\nfirst statements were nevertheless disappointing to the believers that\r\nradical reforms alone can save Russia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX.

Istorya maloi Rossii (History of Little\r\nRussia) Moscow, 1842.\r\n\r\n    _Bantysh-Kamenski_ was born in Moscow in 1788. Between 1825\r\n    and 1828 he was governor of Tobolsk, and from 1836 to 1838,\r\n    governor of Vilna. After that he was engaged in the ministry\r\n    of the interior. He died at St. Petersburg in 1850. Besides\r\n    his “History of Little Russia,” which is to this day the\r\n    only complete history in this department, he also wrote a\r\n    biographical dictionary and the lives of a number of Russian\r\n    statesmen and commanders.\r\n\r\n=Bantysh-Kamenski=, N., Diplomatitcheskoe sobranie dyel mezhdu Rossiiskim\r\ni Kitaiskim gosudarstvom s 1619 po 1792 god (a collection of diplomatic\r\npapers between the Russian and Chinese empires from 1619 to 1792)\r\nKazan, 1882; Obzor vnyeshnikh snoshenyi Rossii po 1800 g (a review of\r\nthe foreign relations of Russia up to the year 1800, Courland, Livonia,\r\nEsthonia, Poland, and Portugal), Moscow, 1897.--=Bell=, R., Russia\r\n(Cabinet Cyclopædia series), London, 1836, 3 vol.--=Bernhardi=, T.\r\nvon, Geschichte Russlands und der europäischen Politik in den Jahren\r\n1814-1831, Leipsic, 1868-1878, 3 vols.--=Bestuzhev-Riumin=, K.

Besides the History, he has been the author of a\r\n    number of monographs. His method is thorough, painstaking,\r\n    and minute. He insists on a many-sided study of the national\r\n    life, and of the exclusion of all philosophical or general\r\n    theories, and devotes much more space to internal than to\r\n    external history, paying special attention to forms of family\r\n    life, political organisation, law, religion, and literature.\r\n    The introductory chapters give a valuable account of the source\r\n    and authorities of Russian history. At his death, in 1897, he\r\n    left his History a torso. It was translated into German by Dr.\r\n    Schiemann (Mitau, 1873-1875).\r\n\r\n=Beveridge=, A.

After engaging for six years in business, he turned\r\n    his attention to the study of history, which he pursued at\r\n    Heidelberg, Jena, and Berlin. After returning to St. Petersburg\r\n    he became professor of history at the Imperial School of law,\r\n    in 1867 professor at the university of Odessa, and in 1872 at\r\n    Dorpat. Owing to his German origin, he was removed in 1891 from\r\n    Dorpat and transferred to the university of Kazan, but at his\r\n    request he was permitted to settle at Jena. Brueckner is, like\r\n    Schiemann and Eckhardt, a German-Russian, and as such has a\r\n    special qualification for the presentation of Russian history\r\n    to a West-European audience. He has written numerous works both\r\n    in Russian and in German, and takes rank with the foremost\r\n    historians of Russia.\r\n\r\n=Brueggen=, E. von der, Polens Auflösung, Leipsic, 1878; Wie Russland\r\neuropäisch wurde, Leipsic, 1885.--=Bunge=, F.

From 1860 to 1867 he was the secretary of the\r\n    Evangelical-Lutheran Consistory at Riga, one of the editors of\r\n    the Riga _Zeitung_, and an active member of the Liberal-German\r\n    party in the Baltic provinces of Russia. After the leaders of\r\n    this party had been removed from their offices on account of\r\n    their Germanising tendencies, Eckardt emigrated to Germany,\r\n    where he was active first as a journalist, then as secretary\r\n    of the Hamburg senate, and finally as German consul at Tunis,\r\n    Marseilles and Stockholm. Eckardt was the author of numerous\r\n    works and pamphlets, many of which were published anonymously,\r\n    on Russian, Baltic, and German affairs. He was less an\r\n    historian than a publicist and politician; but he had an\r\n    intimate knowledge of the Russia of his own day, the Russia of\r\n    Alexander II and Alexander III, and his works are indispensable\r\n    for an understanding of Russian parties and the vacillations\r\n    of Russian public opinion. His own point of view is that of a\r\n    conservative liberal.\r\n\r\n=Edwards=, H.

M., Istorya gosudarstva rossiiskavo (History of the\r\nRussian Empire), St. Petersburg, 1818-1829, 12 vols.\r\n\r\n    _Nikolai Mikhailovitch Karamzin_ was born December 12, 1765,\r\n    at the village of Mikhailovka, in the government of Orenburg,\r\n    and died June 3, 1826, at Tsarskoi Selo. His first literary\r\n    efforts consisted of translations of essays and poems from\r\n    foreign languages. In 1789 he undertook a journey to Germany,\r\n    France, Switzerland and England, the literary result of which\r\n    was his _Letters of a Russian Traveller_, elegant, poetical\r\n    and sentimental. These letters were first published in the\r\n    _Moscow Journal_, of which he was the founder, and which he\r\n    edited in 1791-1792. In the same periodical also appeared\r\n    some of his original stories, one of which treats of the\r\n    fall of Novgorod. From 1794 to 1799 he published a number of\r\n    miscellanies, _Aglaia_, _The Aonides_, and the _Pantheon_,\r\n    containing original as well as translated matter. In 1802-1803\r\n    Karamzin edited the _European Messenger_, destined to become\r\n    one of the most important Russian reviews, and of which he was\r\n    the founder. He then turned to the work of his life, the great\r\n    _History of the Russian Empire_, which was to occupy him till\r\n    his death. In this last enterprise he was aided and encouraged\r\n    by the emperor Alexander I, who contributed 60,000 rubles\r\n    to the cost of publication. The history terminates at the\r\n    accession of Michael Romanov in 1613. Karamzin’s work is the\r\n    first great Russian history. Its style is elegant and flowing,\r\n    its erudition large and solid, and it abounds in curious\r\n    information. It is owing to these qualities that the book still\r\n    maintains its place, although much of it has by this time\r\n    become obsolete. The book is especially strong in description\r\n    of battles and analysis of character. Its spirit is frankly\r\n    reactionary. The barbarism of early Russia is glossed over by\r\n    a glittering veil of romanticism, the material, intellectual\r\n    and moral condition of the Russian people is almost entirely\r\n    ignored, and the book has been styled the “epic of despotism.”\r\n    A French translation appeared at Paris in 1819-1820, and a\r\n    German one at Leipsic in 1820-1833.\r\n\r\n=Kelly=, W.

In 1846 he was\r\n    appointed to a professorship of history in the university of\r\n    Kiev. Owing to his activity for the reviving of Little Russian\r\n    literature he was accused of harbouring separatist tendencies,\r\n    arrested, imprisoned for a whole year, and then banished to\r\n    Saratov and forbidden to teach or publish his writings. On\r\n    the accession of Alexander II he was pardoned, and in 1859 he\r\n    was appointed professor of history at the university of St.\r\n    Petersburg. But in 1862, when the university was closed in\r\n    consequence of students’ disorders, he resigned his post, and\r\n    henceforth devoted himself exclusively to writing. He died at\r\n    St. Petersburg, April 19th, 1885. His poetical works, which\r\n    were written in the Little Russian dialect under the _nom\r\n    de plume_ of Jeremiah Halka, were published collectively at\r\n    Odessa, 1875. Some of them have been translated into German. As\r\n    an historian Kostomarov occupies a very high place in Russian\r\n    literature. His work has assumed the form of monographs, owing\r\n    to his idea that Russian history cannot be understood without\r\n    an exhaustive study of the numerous ethnological elements and\r\n    the separate territorial divisions of which the Russian empire\r\n    is composed. In his own words, “the Russian empire represents\r\n    an integration of parts that once led an independent existence,\r\n    and for a considerable time after unification the life of\r\n    the parts expressed itself in separate tendencies within the\r\n    general political structure. To discover and disclose these\r\n    peculiarities of national life in the divisions that make\r\n    up the Russian empire, was the problem I set before myself\r\n    in my historical labours.” The justification of this view\r\n    lies in the comparative recency of the Russian empire, its\r\n    weakness in the assumption that the national or provincial\r\n    character is unchangeable and immobile. Kostomarov had at his\r\n    command a vigorous, dramatic style and a lively imagination,\r\n    and his books contributed greatly toward the popularisation\r\n    of historical studies in Russia: but he was also possessed\r\n    in a high degree of the critical faculty, and more than one\r\n    historical legend has been demolished in his pages. His\r\n    “Russian History in Biographies” was translated into German and\r\n    published at Leipsic, 1886-1889.\r\n\r\n=Kovalevski=, M., Modern Customs and Ancient Laws of Russia, London,\r\n1891; Le Régime économique de la Russie, Paris, 1896; L’Agriculture en\r\nRussie, Paris, 1897; Russian Political Institutions, Chicago, 1902.\r\n\r\n    _Maxim Kovalevski_ was born at Kharkov in 1851, of a rich and\r\n    noble family that is remarkable for the number of men--and\r\n    one woman--of science it has given to Russia. He studied at\r\n    Berlin, Paris, and London, and in 1877-1887 he was professor\r\n    of comparative law at the university of Moscow. Owing to his\r\n    liberal views he was compelled to give up his position. Since\r\n    then he has settled at Paris, where he has collected a valuable\r\n    library, and lectured at various seats of learning in Europe\r\n    and America--Stockholm, Oxford, Brussels, Chicago.

In this\r\n    capacity he devoted himself toward reorganising the army on\r\n    a modern basis, and in 1874 he introduced universal military\r\n    service. The campaigns of 1877-1878 showed the shortcomings as\r\n    well as the improvements of the army under his administration.\r\n    In 1878 the title of count was conferred on him.

M., Istorya Rossii s drevneyshikh\r\nvremyon (History of Russia from the Earliest Times), Moscow, 1863-1875,\r\n29 vols.\r\n\r\n    _Sergei Mikhailovitch Soloviov_ was born May 17th, 1820. In\r\n    1850 he became a professor at the university of Moscow. In\r\n    1877 he came into conflict with the reactionary policy of\r\n    the government toward the universities, and demanded and\r\n    obtained his dismissal. He died October 16th, 1879. Besides his\r\n    monumental _History of Russia_ he was the author of numerous\r\n    monographs. _The Relations Between the Russian Princes of the\r\n    House of Rurik_ was of epoch-making importance in Russian\r\n    historical literature. His _History of the Fall of Poland_ has\r\n    become the standard work on the subject and was translated\r\n    into German (Gotha, 1865). But all his other works are cast\r\n    into the shade by his stupendous _History of Russia from\r\n    the Earliest Times_, in which he proposed to himself a task\r\n    excelling, perhaps, the power of any single human being--the\r\n    presentation of the entire history of his country, based\r\n    exclusively on original research. The result has, therefore,\r\n    been not wholly successful, and the later volumes present\r\n    the appearance of a mere aggregation of materials hastily\r\n    arranged. But the material is of the finest quality and will\r\n    serve as a rich quarry for all future historians. Soloviov’s\r\n    method of presentation is calm and dispassionate, his style\r\n    tranquil and somewhat dry, but admirably clear. From Karamzin\r\n    to Soloviov the gulf is wide indeed, and perhaps it will be\r\n    well to present a few of the latter’s ideas in order to show\r\n    the indebtedness that all modern historians of Russia owe\r\n    to him. Russian society, like all primitive society, was in\r\n    its origin tribal and based on kinship. The introduction of\r\n    Varangian rule represents the beginnings of the dissolution of\r\n    that society and the introduction of political society, based\r\n    on territory. But society was still in a transitional stage.\r\n    The warlike followers of the princes were free to renounce\r\n    their allegiance to one master and to choose another in his\r\n    stead, and the principle of kinship was still dominant within\r\n    the house of Rurik itself, thus counteracting the separatist\r\n    tendencies of the appanages. It was the colonisation of the\r\n    north and east and the removal of the center of Russian life to\r\n    the Volga, that first makes possible, as well as necessary, the\r\n    centralisation of power: for the colonists settle on land that\r\n    belongs to the prince and in cities founded by him, while the\r\n    colonists themselves come from different parts of Russia and\r\n    are unconnected by the bond of kinship. In the struggle that\r\n    follows between the prince and the refractory, unsubmissive\r\n    elements--whether of the common people or of the noble\r\n    followers--the prince is victorious and the irreconcileables\r\n    flee to the forests of the north or to the steppes of the\r\n    south. Thus we have the origin of the robber bands, and of the\r\n    Cossacks--another name for the same thing. But the removal of\r\n    the centre to the Volga also implies the estrangement of Russia\r\n    from European influences, and the Tatar rule plays in this only\r\n    a subordinate and external part. The grand princes of Moscow\r\n    in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries are thus seen to be\r\n    the continuators of the policy of the grand princes of Suzdal\r\n    in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, while the episode\r\n    of the period of confusion represents an abortive attempt at\r\n    the establishment of a milder rule by the Cossacks. Ivan III\r\n    and Ivan IV, in their struggle with the foreigner, begin to\r\n    appreciate the superior potency of European civilisation,\r\n    and are the precursors of Peter the Great. But the new\r\n    tendencies work with unceasing force during the intervening\r\n    period, and those who resist the new tendencies become the\r\n    nonconformists or Raskolniki (Old Ritualists). This tendency\r\n    finds its parallel in Western Europe, where the task had been\r\n    accomplished two centuries earlier; but not so the effort\r\n    to reach the sea, which is a peculiar Russian phenomenon.\r\n    Soloviov’s work reaches down to 1774.\r\n\r\n=Sorel=, A., Histoire du traité de Paris, Paris, 1873; La question\r\nd’Orient au XVIII. siècle, Paris, 1889.--=Stepniak=, S.

This date is purely\r\n    conventional.\r\n\r\n    865 Askold and Dir, two Varangian chieftains who had settled at\r\n    Kiev, lead an unsuccessful expedition against Constantinople.\r\n\r\n    879 Rurik dies, leaving the regency of the principality and the\r\n    guardianship of his son Igor to =Oleg=.\r\n\r\n    882 Oleg takes possession of Kiev after killing Askold and Dir,\r\n    and makes that city his capital.\r\n\r\n    907 Oleg leads an expedition consisting of eighty thousand men\r\n    and two thousand boats against Constantinople. A treaty of\r\n    peace and commerce is concluded.\r\n\r\n    911 Oleg renews the treaty with the emperor of Constantinople\r\n    securing valuable trading privileges for the Russians.\r\n\r\n    913 Oleg dies, and is succeeded by =Igor=.\r\n\r\n    941 Igor leads an expedition against Constantinople. His ships\r\n    are destroyed by the Greek fire, and with great difficulty he\r\n    brings his troops back to Kiev.\r\n\r\n    944 Igor leads a second expedition against Constantinople. The\r\n    Byzantines rid themselves of the barbarians by renewing the\r\n    treaty that had been made with Oleg and also paying a ransom.\r\n    The treaty is given in full by Nestor. Of the fifty names\r\n    attached to it three are Slavonic and the rest Norse, which\r\n    shows that the two races, the conquerors and the conquered, are\r\n    beginning to be fused.\r\n\r\n    945 Igor is killed by the Drevlians, a Slavonic tribe. His\r\n    wife Olga assumes the regency during the minority of his son\r\n    Sviatoslav.\r\n\r\n    955 Olga embraces Greek Christianity. Her subjects, however,\r\n    remain on the whole pagans.\r\n\r\n    964 =Sviatoslav= assumes the rule. He is the first of the\r\n    Varangians to bear a Slavonic name.\r\n\r\n    968 Sviatoslav, in the pay of the Byzantine emperor Nicephoros,\r\n    leads an army of 60,000 men against the Bulgarians of the\r\n    Danube.\r\n\r\n    970 Sviatoslav, after dividing the country among his three\r\n    sons, again marches to Bulgaria, this time on his own account.\r\n\r\n    972 Sviatoslav is defeated at Silistria and compelled to\r\n    evacuate the Balkan peninsula.\r\n\r\n    973 On his retreat, Sviatoslav is surprised and killed by the\r\n    Petchenegs of the Dnieper.\r\n\r\n    977 Rout of Oleg by Iaropolk and his death.\r\n\r\n    980 =Vladimir=, after killing Iaropolk, becomes sole ruler.\r\n\r\n    988 Vladimir is baptized and makes Greek Christianity the state\r\n    religion. On the day of his baptism he marries a daughter of\r\n    the Byzantine emperor Romanos II.\r\n\r\n    1015 Vladimir dies and the country is divided among his eight\r\n    sons and a nephew.\r\n\r\n    1019 =Iaroslav=, prince of Novgorod and the youngest son of\r\n    Vladimir, finally becomes grand prince, and removes his capital\r\n    to Kiev.\r\n\r\n    1054 Iaroslav dies. The country is divided among his five\r\n    sons, one of whom, Iziaslav, is recognised as grand prince of\r\n    Kiev. The custom, first introduced by Sviatoslav of breaking\r\n    up the country into appanages, has now reached its full\r\n    fruition. Russia has become an extremely loose federation of\r\n    principalities. The central authority has been reduced to a\r\n    nullity, and the period is filled with wars among the petty\r\n    princes. This, of course, weakened the power of Russia for\r\n    resisting foreign invaders, and made it an easy prey to the\r\n    eastern nomadic tribes, from the Polovtsi to the Tatars. The\r\n    chief events during this period are the foundation of Moscow\r\n    (1147), the rise of Suzdal in Vladimir, and the pillaging\r\n    of Kiev (1169) by Prince Andrew Bogoliubski of Suzdal. The\r\n    hegemony of Kiev comes to an end for all time. The principal\r\n    figures during this period are those of Vladimir II, surnamed\r\n    Monomakh (1113-1125), and of Andrew Bogoliubski (1157-1175),\r\n    who strove to re-establish some sort of unity and was\r\n    assassinated by his nobles.\r\n\r\n    1068 The people of Kiev liberate Vseslav and make him grand\r\n    prince.\r\n\r\n    1069 Iziaslav is restored by Boleslaw the Bold of Poland.\r\n\r\n    1073 Iziaslav is again expelled from Kiev by his brothers\r\n    Sviatoslav and Vsevolod. =Sviatoslav= becomes grand prince.\r\n\r\n    1076 Death of Sviatoslav. He is succeeded by Vsevolod.\r\n\r\n    1077 Iziaslav is again restored to the grand princedom.\r\n\r\n    1078 Iziaslav dies and is succeeded by =Vsevolod=.\r\n\r\n    1084 Failure of Vsevolod’s attempt to conquer Tmoutorakan\r\n    (Tmutarakan).\r\n\r\n    1093 Death of Vsevolod and accession of =Sviatopolk=, the\r\n    second son of Iziaslav. The Polovtsi defeat the Russians in the\r\n    battle of Tripole.\r\n\r\n    1097 The congress of princes at Lubetz.\r\n\r\n    1100 The congress of princes at Uvetitchi.\r\n\r\n    1111 Defeat of the Polovtsi on the Sula.\r\n\r\n    1113 Death of Sviatopolk and accession of =Vladimir Monomakh=.\r\n\r\n    1125 Death of Monomakh.\r\n\r\n    1147 Legendary date for the foundation of Moscow.\r\n\r\n    1157 Andrew Bogoliubski becomes prince of Suzdal.\r\n\r\n    1169 Kiev is captured and plundered by Andrew Bogoliubski.\r\n\r\n    1175 Andrew Bogoliubski is assassinated.\r\n\r\n    1221 Nijni-Novgorod is founded by Iuri, grand prince of Suzdal.\r\n\r\n    1223 First invasion of Russia by the Mongols under Jenghiz\r\n    Khan. The Russians are defeated on the banks of the Kalka, near\r\n    where it flows into the Sea of Azov and adjoining the present\r\n    site of the town of Mariupol.\r\n\r\n    1237-38 The Mongols, under Jenghiz Khan’s grandson, Batu,\r\n    invade northern Russia, burn Moscow, defeat twice the army of\r\n    Suzdal (at Kolomna on the Oku and on the Sit), and plunder\r\n    Riazan, Suzdal, Iaroslavl, and Tver. But Novgorod is spared.\r\n\r\n    1239-40 The Mongols ravage southern Russia, burn Tchernigov\r\n    and Kiev, and extend their conquests as far west as Volhinia\r\n    and Galicia. All Russia is now under the yoke of the Mongols,\r\n    except the territory of Novgorod.\r\n\r\n    1240 Alexander, prince of Novgorod, defeats the Swedes on the\r\n    Neva; whence his surname Nevski.\r\n\r\n    1242 Batu establishes the Golden Horde of Kiptchak, with\r\n    Sarai, on one of the mouths of the Volga, as its capital. It\r\n    constituted one of the five divisions of the great empire of\r\n    Jenghiz Khan.\r\n\r\n    1245 Alexander Nevski defeats the German Sword-bearing Knights\r\n    on Lake Peipus, in the “battle of the ice.”\r\n\r\n    1260 Novgorod submits to the Mongols and consents to pay\r\n    tribute.\r\n\r\n    1263 Death of Alexander Nevski.\r\n\r\n    1303 Death of =Daniel Alexandrovitch=, founder of the Moscow\r\n    dynasty.\r\n\r\n    1320 Prince Michael of Tver is executed by order of the khan.\r\n\r\n    1321 Vladimir in Volhinia is conquered by the Lithuanians. Kiev\r\n    and all west Russia soon become Lithuanian.\r\n\r\n    1404 Smolensk is annexed to Lithuania. A son of Alexander\r\n    Nevski, named Daniel, was the founder of the principality\r\n    of Moscow, to which he added the cities of Kolomna and\r\n    Pereiaslavl. He was succeeded by his son =Iuri Danilovitch=\r\n    (1303-1325), who annexed Mozhaisk. In 1313 he marries a sister\r\n    of Usbek Khan. In 1320 he is appointed grand prince in place\r\n    of his murdered rival, Michael of Tver. Iuri is the initiator\r\n    of the Muscovite policy to dominate Russia with the aid of\r\n    the Tatars, for whom the Muscovite princes henceforth act as\r\n    tax collectors. In 1325 he was assassinated by Dmitri, son\r\n    of Michael of Tver, and =Alexander=, Michael’s second son is\r\n    appointed grand prince. But the grand princedom soon reverts to\r\n    Moscow, and Alexander is executed in 1329. Iuri is succeeded\r\n    by his brother =Ivan Kalita= (1328-1340), who receives from\r\n    Usbek Khan Vladimir and Novgorod together with the grand\r\n    princedom, and who also adds Tver to his dominions. He assures\r\n    the pre-eminence of Moscow in the Russian church by inducing\r\n    the metropolitan to reside there, thereby also securing the\r\n    alliance of the all-powerful church in the realisation of\r\n    his political schemes. =Simeon the Proud=, son of Kalita\r\n    (1340-1353), =Ivan II=, (1353-1359), brother of Simeon, and\r\n    =Dmitri Donskoi= (1359-1389), son of Ivan II, continue the\r\n    policy of dominating Russia with the aid of the Tatars, whom\r\n    they conciliate with Russian gold, while they gain the support\r\n    of the nobles by enhancing their power at the expense of the\r\n    princes of appanages. Towards the end of his reign Dmitri feels\r\n    himself strong enough to resist the Tatars, whom he defeats in\r\n    the battle of Kulikovo (1380); but two years later the Mongol\r\n    general, Toktamish, invades Russia, burns Moscow and puts to\r\n    death a great number of the inhabitants. Dmitri was succeeded\r\n    by his son =Vasili= (1389-1425). On the death of the latter,\r\n    first his brother, and then his brother’s son, laid claim to\r\n    the succession; but the direct lineal succession triumphed\r\n    twice in the person of Vasili’s son, known as =Vasili the\r\n    Blind= (1425-1462).\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FIFTEENTH CENTURY\r\n\r\n    1407 The river Ugra is made the boundary between Moscow and\r\n    Lithuania.\r\n\r\n    1408 Invasion of Moscow by the Tatars, who burn many towns and\r\n    villages, but fail to capture the Kremlin.\r\n\r\n    1412 Vasili Dmitrievitch goes to the Horde, pays tribute, and\r\n    the khan confirms to him the grand princedom.\r\n\r\n    1435 Vasili Vasilievitch blinds his cousin Vasili Kossoi.\r\n\r\n    1446 Vasili Vasilievitch is blinded by Dmitri Shemiaka of\r\n    Galicia.\r\n\r\n    1448 The archbishop Jonas is elected metropolitan by an\r\n    assembly of the Russian bishops, without regard to the\r\n    patriarch of Constantinople.\r\n\r\n    1453 Dmitri Shemiaka is poisoned.\r\n\r\n    1462 =Ivan III=, son of Vasili ascends the throne. He assumes\r\n    the title _gossudar_ (lord, autocrat), and is regarded as the\r\n    founder of autocracy.\r\n\r\n    1463 The princes of Iaroslav cede their domain to Moscow.\r\n\r\n    1464 Ivan gives the hand of his sister to Vasili, prince of\r\n    Riazan, thus making sure of the approximate annexation of that\r\n    appanage.\r\n\r\n    1469 The khanate of Kazan becomes a dependency of Moscow.\r\n\r\n    1472 Ivan conquers Perm. Marries the Byzantine princess Sophia,\r\n    niece of the last emperor of Constantinople, Constantine\r\n    Palæologus. Assumes the title of czar and adopts the two-headed\r\n    eagle as the symbol of his authority. In consequence of this\r\n    marriage many Greeks come to Moscow, bringing with them\r\n    Byzantine culture.\r\n\r\n    1474 The princes of Rostov sell their domain to Moscow.\r\n\r\n    1478 The republic of Novgorod is annexed. The principal\r\n    citizens are brought prisoners to Moscow, their property is\r\n    confiscated, the possessions of the clergy serve to endow the\r\n    boyar followers of Ivan. Ahmed, khan of the Golden Horde, sends\r\n    ambassadors demanding homage. Ivan puts the envoys to death,\r\n    except one, who was to take back the news to his master. The\r\n    reply of Ahmed to this outrage is a declaration of war.\r\n\r\n    1479 Ivan issues Sudebnik, or Books of Laws, second Russian\r\n    code after the Russkaia Pravda of Iaroslav. A comparison of\r\n    two codes shows how much the Russian character was lowered by\r\n    Mongol domination; it is in the reign of Ivan that we first\r\n    hear of the use of the knout.\r\n\r\n    1480 The Mongols invade Russia. The two armies meet on the\r\n    banks of the Oka and flee from each other in mutual fear. On\r\n    his retreat Ahmed is killed and his army is annihilated by the\r\n    Nogai Tatars.\r\n\r\n    1482 Cannon is used for first time at the siege of Fellin in\r\n    Livonia. It was founded by the architect and engineer Aristotle\r\n    Fioraventi of Bologna, the builder of the Kremlin.\r\n\r\n    1485 The principality of Tver is annexed to Moscow.\r\n\r\n    1485 The last prince of Vereya leaves his domains by will to\r\n    Ivan.\r\n\r\n    1489 Viatka, a daughter of the city of Novgorod and Pskov, and\r\n    like them a republic, is annexed.\r\n\r\n    1489 Poppel comes to Moscow as the first German ambassador.\r\n\r\n    1491 Mines of Petchora discovered. For first time silver and\r\n    copper money is coined at Moscow from produce of Russian mines.\r\n\r\n    1492-1503 A large part of Little Russia is reconquered from\r\n    Lithuanians.\r\n\r\n    1494 Alexander of Lithuania marries Ivan’s daughter Helen.\r\n\r\n    1495 Ivan, considering himself to have been insulted by a\r\n    Hanseatic city, orders all merchants of all the cities of\r\n    that union at Novgorod to be put in chains and their property\r\n    confiscated. This marks the end of Novgorod’s commercial\r\n    greatness.\r\n\r\n    1499 The princes of Tchernigov and Novgorod-Seversk come over\r\n    to Moscow.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SIXTEENTH CENTURY\r\n\r\n    1501 Russians routed in the battle of the Siritza, near\r\n    Izborsk, by the grand-master of the Teutonic order, Hermann von\r\n    Plettenberg.\r\n\r\n    1503 A treaty is concluded with Lithuania. Moscow retains all\r\n    her conquests, and Ivan is granted the title of sovereign of\r\n    all Russia.\r\n\r\n    1505 Death of Ivan. =Vasili=, second son of Ivan, succeeds him.\r\n\r\n    1508 The Russian army is defeated by the revolted people of\r\n    Kazan. The victors unite with the Tatars of the Crimea, invade\r\n    Russia and carry their ravages up to the gates of Moscow.\r\n    Vasili pays a large ransom for the safety of his capital, and\r\n    signs a treaty by which he engages to become tributary to\r\n    the khan. Thirty thousand prisoners are carried off by the\r\n    invaders, and sold at Kaffa to the Turks.\r\n\r\n    1510 Pskov, last Slavonic republic, annexed.\r\n\r\n    1514 Smolensk is taken from the Lithuanians after being held by\r\n    them for 110 years. But in the same year the Lithuanians defeat\r\n    the Russian force at Orsha, on left bank of the Dnieper. Thirty\r\n    thousand Russians are said to have fallen in battle.\r\n\r\n    1521 Riazan and Novgorod-Seversk, the last independent\r\n    principalities, are annexed. Crimean Tatars devastate the\r\n    country.\r\n\r\n    1523 A second expedition against Kazan, consisting of 150,000\r\n    men, fails of its object; one of its two divisions is almost\r\n    annihilated.\r\n\r\n    1530 Third expedition against Kazan. The city is surprised by\r\n    night and 60,000 inhabitants are massacred. But the Russian\r\n    commander, bribed, it is said, by the remaining Kazanians,\r\n    enters into a treaty of peace with them.\r\n\r\n    1533 Vasili dies. Regency of his wife, Helena Glinska, 1533-37.\r\n    Supremacy of the Shuiski, 1537-43. Ivan is under the influence\r\n    of the Glinski till 1547, when they were torn in pieces by the\r\n    infuriated Moscow populace. Such was the youth of Ivan the\r\n    Terrible.\r\n\r\n    1547 =Ivan= is crowned and takes the title of Czar.\r\n\r\n    1550 The Sudebnik of his grandfather Ivan III is revised.\r\n\r\n    1551 The Stoglav, or Book of the Hundred Chapters, by which the\r\n    affairs of the church were regulated, is issued.\r\n\r\n    1552 Kazan, which had freed itself during his father’s reign,\r\n    is annexed.\r\n\r\n    1553 Chancellor arrives at Archangel and proceeds to Moscow.\r\n    The English secure great trading privileges and establish\r\n    factories in the country.\r\n\r\n    1556 Astrakhan is annexed. The power of the Mongols is now\r\n    almost completely broken.\r\n\r\n    1558 Treaty with Elizabeth of England. A Russian army invades\r\n    Livonia and takes several towns. The Teutonic Order thereupon\r\n    makes an alliance with Poland.\r\n\r\n    1564 Ivan, with a few personal friends, retires to\r\n    Alexandrovskoe, near Moscow, and does not return until after\r\n    repeated supplications by his nobles. A printing press\r\n    established at Moscow.\r\n\r\n    1571 The Mongols of Crimea invade Russia, burn Moscow, drag\r\n    100,000 Russians into slavery. Next year they make another\r\n    raid, but are defeated.\r\n\r\n    1580 Conquest of Siberia by the Cossack Iermak as far as the\r\n    Irtish river.\r\n\r\n    1581 Ivan kills his eldest son in a fit of fury.\r\n\r\n    1582 Peace of Sapolye. Ivan is forced to surrender to Stephen\r\n    Bathori (Battori) king of Poland all his conquests in Livonia.\r\n    The attempt to open for Russia a passage in the Baltic fails\r\n    for the present.\r\n\r\n    1584 Death of Ivan. =Feodor=, his weak-minded son, succeeds\r\n    Ivan. Boris Godunov, Feodor’s brother-in-law, is the real ruler.\r\n\r\n    1587 A company of Parisian merchants obtains trading privileges.\r\n\r\n    1590 War with Sweden.\r\n\r\n    1591 Dmitri, the younger brother of Feodor (Ivan’s son by his\r\n    seventh wife), and the only obstacle to Godunov’s ambition,\r\n    dies at Uglitch. The khan of Crimea makes one of his periodical\r\n    raids against Moscow, but is repulsed with great slaughter.\r\n\r\n    1592 Godunov issues a ukase (edict) binding the peasant to the\r\n    soil, thus reducing him to unmitigated serfdom. As a result,\r\n    peasants emigrate in large numbers to the Cossacks in order to\r\n    preserve their freedom.\r\n\r\n    1597 An edict is issued prescribing the most vigorous measures\r\n    for the recovery of fugitive serfs.\r\n\r\n    1598 Death of Feodor, last of the Ruriks. =Boris Godunov= is\r\n    elected to succeed him, first by the Council of Boyars (douma)\r\n    and then by a General Assembly (Sobór).\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY\r\n\r\n    1601 A terrible famine, accompanied by pestilence, devastates\r\n    Russia. Boris causes immense quantities of provisions to be\r\n    distributed in Moscow, whither multitudes flock from all the\r\n    provinces. Five hundred thousand are said to have perished in\r\n    Moscow alone, which had become a city of cannibals.\r\n\r\n    1604 Dmitri the Impostor invades Russia and is victorious on\r\n    the Desna.\r\n\r\n    1605 Dmitri is defeated on the plain of Dobrinitchi, not far\r\n    from Ord. Godunov dies. His son =Feodor= is proclaimed his\r\n    successor. Basmanov, commander of the army, proclaims Dmitri.\r\n    Feodor and his mother are strangled and Dmitri enters Moscow.\r\n\r\n    1606 A rebellion breaks out under Vasili Shuiski. Dmitri is\r\n    killed. =Shuiski= is proclaimed emperor.\r\n\r\n    1608 A second false Dmitri defeats Shuiski’s army near Volkhov,\r\n    but fails in an attack on the Troitsa monastery, near Moscow.\r\n    He is murdered by one of his followers in 1610.\r\n\r\n    1609 The Poles invade Russia and lay siege to Smolensk.\r\n\r\n    1610 Shuiski is defeated at Klushino and =Wladislaw=, son of\r\n    the Polish king, is crowned czar.\r\n\r\n    1611 Revolt of the patriots led by Minin and Prince Pojarski.\r\n\r\n    1612 The Poles are driven out of Moscow.\r\n\r\n    1613 =Michael Romanov= is chosen czar.\r\n\r\n    1617 Wladislaw appears with an army under the walls of Moscow,\r\n    but is repulsed. The Treaty of Stolbovna is brought about by\r\n    the mediation of England and Holland: the Russians give up\r\n    Kexholm, Karelia and Ingria to Sweden, and receive in return\r\n    Novgorod, which was lost during the Troublous Period.\r\n\r\n    1618 Wladislaw consents to abandon his claim to the Russian\r\n    throne, the czar gives up his claims to Livonia, Tchernigov and\r\n    Smolensk, and an armistice is concluded for fourteen years.\r\n\r\n    1619 Philarete, the father of Czar Michael, comes back from the\r\n    Polish captivity, is elected patriarch, and becomes his son’s\r\n    associate in the government of the country.\r\n\r\n    1627 The Cossacks of the Don conquer Azov, which they offer\r\n    to the czar. After convoking a sobor, which shows little\r\n    enthusiasm for the enterprise, the czar orders the Cossacks to\r\n    evacuate it.\r\n\r\n    1633 War with Lithuania.\r\n\r\n    1634 Peace of Polianovka: the czar surrenders all claims to\r\n    Livonia and all the country that once belonged to the Order, as\r\n    well as to Smolensk, Tchernigov and Seversk. The Polish king\r\n    abandons his claim to the Russian throne.\r\n\r\n    1645 Death of Michael. He is succeeded by =Alexis=.\r\n\r\n    1648 Revolt at Moscow against misgovernment of the czar’s\r\n    favorites, particularly Morosov, and depreciation of the\r\n    coinage. This revolt led to a new codification of the laws (the\r\n    Ulozhenie), which was based on the preceding codes of Ivan III\r\n    and IV, and was sanctioned by a sobor convoked at Moscow. A new\r\n    police institution, the “chamber of secret affairs,” is created\r\n    for the prevention and suppression of popular uprisings.

The Russian arms are turned against\r\n    Sweden. At first they were successful, and Narva, Dorpat and\r\n    other places in Esthonia were taken, Livonia was conquered,\r\n    but Riga was besieged in vain, and after many losses all the\r\n    conquests are restored.\r\n\r\n    1655-56 The patriarch Nicon calls two councils of the church\r\n    for the purpose of revising the Bible and service-books. In\r\n    consequence of this change a great schism takes place in the\r\n    Russian church. The adherents of the old books are known as\r\n    Raskolniki, and are to this day subjects of persecution.\r\n\r\n    1667 Peace of Andrussov with Poland: Little Russia east of\r\n    the Dnieper, including Smolensk, Kiev, Seversk, Vitebsk, and\r\n    Polotsk are acquired by Russia. Thus the territory which had\r\n    been taken by the Lithuanians and annexed to Poland by Treaty\r\n    of Lublin (1569) became Russian again.\r\n\r\n    1670 Rebellion of Stenka Kazin. He takes Tzaritzin, Astrakhan,\r\n    Saratov, Samara, Nijni-Novgorod, Tambov, and Penza.\r\n\r\n    1671 Stenka Radzin is defeated near Simbirsk and executed at\r\n    Moscow.\r\n\r\n    1676 Death of Alexis.

After a sanguinary outbreak of the\r\n    Strelitz, which lasted three days, =Ivan= and =Peter= were\r\n    declared joint sovereigns, and their sister Sophia was to act\r\n    as regent during their minority.\r\n\r\n    1689 Treaty of Nertchinsk: the fertile region of the Amur,\r\n    conquered by a handful of Cossacks, is restored to the Chinese,\r\n    and the fortress Albazin is rased.\r\n\r\n    1696 Peter takes from the Turks the fort of Azov, situated at\r\n    the mouth of the Don, and converts it into a naval port. In its\r\n    vicinity he commences the building of the new town of Taganrog.\r\n\r\n    1697-98 Peter makes his first journey through Europe.\r\n\r\n    1698 The Strelitz break out into open revolt, which is\r\n    suppressed with great bloodshed.

By the terms of the Treaty of\r\n    the Pruth Peter surrenders to the Turks his artillery, gives\r\n    back Azov, and undertakes to rase Taganrog.\r\n\r\n    1714 The Russians gain over the Swedes the important naval\r\n    victory of Åland or Hankül.

In its place the holy synod is\r\n    established for the supreme direction of church affairs.\r\n\r\n    1722 The _tchin_ is established: whoever enters the service of\r\n    that state becomes a gentleman.
